40 2018-06-16 23:55:55 Agreed. Chiarelli has always had a vision. And it’s often not even a bad one per se. He’s just far too cavalier with  asset value to achieve it. He’s done far too much damage to the team to remain, but at least he ain’t just throwing darts at the wall like Bergevin seems to
41 2018-06-16 23:55:53 #20: I found out there's oil under your property.
42 2018-06-16 23:55:50 Just wait for the winter and heating oil. How many will freeze due to all this winning? I fear for the elderly the most.
43 2018-06-16 23:55:43 Wow dude is hella clueless. I’m sure the native would be happier in their own country too, but we stole that... along with invading Muslim countries for oil... so there is no avoiding the drama when white USA is involved, regardless of religion.

49 2018-06-16 23:54:55 Unlike Saudi, Yemen has no oil to lure Western companies, unlike Saudis, Yemenis have no money to bribe Western politicians. So, MSF can also be targeted as collateral damage, who cares!
50 2018-06-16 23:54:22 Oh, and to save me a google...what does cannabis oil do in mascara?  It is sure good in gummies :)
51 2018-06-16 23:54:04 My dad taught me that when you are threading pipe by hand, you need to make sure you get enough threading oil on it. Or it will break to dies.

53 2018-06-16 23:53:43 Obama claimed to be fighting ISIS during his presidency, yet ISIS took over large chunks of land and began selling pilfered oil under the watchful eye of US forces who were supposed to be killing them. What the hell happened @pplswar and @propornot?

55 2018-06-16 23:53:35 Alberta NDP have stood up for the energy industry. They don't control prices, though.

1. Royalty review
2. Pipeline fight
3. Energy industry ongoing presence in climate leadership plan
4. Carbon tax reinvestment in oil and gas

Kenney pretends policy-less #ucp would be better?
56 2018-06-16 23:53:15 Reminder: Cheap imports of things that have a finite amount (mined goods or crude oil) eventually means those countries will run out or low, and if we havent been tapping out all of our holdings, means we will be sitting pretty when they run out/low
57 2018-06-16 23:53:04 Which is one reason I have to side with KM pipeline now. Like it or not, oil is still an asset to the countries economy. If it means the pipeline will open new trade with other countries, aside from the USA, then lets do it, and do it right..
58 2018-06-16 23:53:00 I always see the emotional hystryonics but nvr a solution, and I dont want to hear " pass comprehensive reform." No reform will stop illegal immigration. We cannot take more than we do now legally.
59 2018-06-16 23:52:42 So much adulting today: took the car in for an oil change, had my eye exam and bought toilet paper.

66 2018-06-16 23:50:22 The oil in Alberta has kept this country economically sound for 50+ years. Why in the world would you make a statement like that?
67 2018-06-16 23:50:21 And I sure hope they don't put Gas & Oil into their automobiles from those countries who just KILL LGBTQ people.
68 2018-06-16 23:49:48 "buy lobster ravioli, boil, sautee tomatoes and fresh basil, add olive oil and a little basalmic vinegar, add the ravioli to toast it a bit."

83 2018-06-16 23:47:36 We will never compete head to head with the states on cost. Particularly given the capital intensive nature of our oil and that we're an arctic country. We rebuild our infrascture every spring. And Alberta has the best infrastructure in the country. She's done *nothing wrong.
84 2018-06-16 23:47:33 You are not offering environment free cars... You re just shifting the environmental.issue from a minor one to a global one. We can shut down an oil.rig in 15 minutes. Can you re- forrest chile' lithium minkng areas in 15 minutes ? Answer this question if you have the guts !!
85 2018-06-16 23:47:27 That's so generous of my mother to take my car in to run a full diagnostics when I just needed oil and freeyon then leaving me with the bill :))))

98 2018-06-16 23:44:34 Maybe we should do what you suggest in Canada. Let’s levy tariffs on the oil we import to eastern Canada. What do you think. Or better yet let’s use our Canadian oil and get it to the east coast. Thoughts?
99 2018-06-16 23:44:29 Take unto yourself chief spices (wü´aTTâ qaH-lükä BüSämîm rö´š [Exo 30:23])! The oil was a concoction of olive oil and four spices (Heb: ḇōśemim), not herbs (Heb:'eseb, Yarak)! Only "spices" were in the oil! You've been listening to more stoner-fiction from Sule Benet.

128 2018-06-16 23:38:54 This is something that can be quite simple & quite difficult. 
Easy>use LP oil in no-bake treats
Difficult>use DIY oil infusion of canna of unknown %
In clinic, we told patients to start low & raise slowly until desired effect is reached. This can get expensive! So much approx.
129 2018-06-16 23:38:45 What’s some good toners for your skin? I heard coconut oil helps..
130 2018-06-16 23:38:44 What the fark nonsense pseudo language is this? Good thing Team Kenny will cut education. Didn’t need it anyways when I go my oil patch job.
131 2018-06-16 23:38:21 I just got kinda tricked into buying a 43 dollar oil dipstick. Now I feel like a dipstick.
132 2018-06-16 23:38:03 Thanks for the reporting. It certainly exposes oil supporters argument that spill likelihood is very low

136 2018-06-16 23:36:09 oh i'll bet it's a chain.... folks gotta oil up around here i guess
137 2018-06-16 23:36:01 I used olive oil, some butter and baked in the oven at 475 for approx. 10 minutes.  T’was following a recipe but maybe I did it wrong.
138 2018-06-16 23:35:43 Take my car in to get the oil changed, I have my dog with me, who by this point is excited and jumping around the car, the guy comes up to my window to offer for us to go to their waiting room, Solvi jumps on my lap and starts yipping at him -

I have a  feeling the pharmaceutical companies are now ready sell whatever they've come up with & these stories are testing the water.  Just wish they'd be honest about it

143 2018-06-16 23:34:27 Which is better: garlic cooked in butter or oil, or human companionship?
144 2018-06-16 23:34:03 LSFO is false name. High-sulfur-fuel-oil (HSFO) is cheap because it is what is left after the distillate and other quality fuels are removed. To make LSFO they take 6 parts low-sulfur diesel like fuel and add one part HSFO, so the cost is close to diesel.

145 2018-06-16 23:34:02 According to history times politics today: Trump is the next Hitler, who is also building a big wall so Stalin, and since it's all downhill from peak oil, all we have to do is get past 1918 and escape to 1914, and Kaiser is Maxed out, it should be smooth sailing with lots of spam
146 2018-06-16 23:33:49 Actually it does none of the sort.  But then you never did follow reality, you have always been the conspiracy type.  One of these days your followers will wake up and see you as the snake oil peddler that you are.
147 2018-06-16 23:33:46 Don't you have more important things to be outraged about?  Like I dunno, global warming destroying the way of life of some tribes, and big oil companies destroying land of others?  Stuff like that?  Seems like a more pressing issue than harassing a comic artist.
148 2018-06-16 23:33:37 I wish I were an oil magnate :-/
149 2018-06-16 23:33:29 That's why it's hard... B separates everything nicely and makes it look a bit more detailed, while A almost looks like hoses carrying fuel or oil or something through processing chambers. So far, that's two votes for B.
150 2018-06-16 23:33:00 I jus took my last and got my brakes and oil done  tired of priorities man
151 2018-06-16 23:32:57 ive been eating a lot of salmon lately, im genuinely curious what you were trying to do here

Ive found that just brushing filets with some olive oil, and some sort of light seasoning/butter and dill plus lemon juice on top of it is the way to go
152 2018-06-16 23:32:27 Bait the trap with apple and some aniseed oil... Gets 'em every time.
153 2018-06-16 23:32:16 And this is the reason why bathing in a pot of boiling oil is more popular than the media.

Please give me money!
162 2018-06-16 23:30:53 @TrabiMechanic I've just tried violife original flavour grated vegan cheese . It's based on coconut oil and it actually melts! And tastes a lot like the real thing. I hope the rest of their vegan cheeses are as good!
163 2018-06-16 23:30:21 Diet reminders: eat oily fish twice a week and take a fish oil supplement on every other day.
164 2018-06-16 23:30:14 Slice in half, spray with olive oil spray salt and pepper (I used garlic salt) and grill for 5-6 minutes. It’s very tasty
165 2018-06-16 23:30:04 Wah go buy some Transmission oil

#BigOil is GOUGING consumers based on crude oil price levels!
Government NEEDS to STOP #BigOilCollusion!

@JustinTrudeau & @fordnation need to make a #GasTaxPledge to cap govt revenues on fuel!

175 2018-06-16 23:27:15 I once saw a movie where a lady who was a witch put whole raw tomatoes, peppers, onions, raw meat, oil and maggi in a pot, covered it and immediately opened it to reveal a fully cooked pot of stew. If I had jazz, that’s the kind of stuff I’d do with it

177 2018-06-16 23:27:03 This is great news for  #CharlotteCaldwell and Billy.  After having epilepsy for over 40 years. I just hope they will receive more than just the 20 days of cannabis oil that the Home Secretary has allowed because I would never want anyone to have this illness at all.

187 2018-06-16 23:24:49 You can divide art and art school black even further. One has oil paint on the sleeves of their hoodies.
188 2018-06-16 23:24:46 I used to use the olive oil one too but I like the Argo oil one more. I mostly just use th Cantu leave in conditioner, water, and my own special mixture of oils and shit for my hair daily
189 2018-06-16 23:24:46 Today and Monday will literally be the worst time to fly out of Salt Lake. All those essential oil convention attendees will ruin the airpirt and every flight out.

194 2018-06-16 23:23:40 Billy Joel, indeed. Only the profoundly deaf could find him barely tolerable. He’s Elton John minus the paddling pool and the olive oil. Unless, of course, someone knows otherwise...
195 2018-06-16 23:23:38 Nice! I imagine the problem after that would be removing the oil from the mammal without getting mauled.
196 2018-06-16 23:23:35 Look I'm not saying I want to stick my hand in a vat of hot oil... but I am saying that IF that oil were lukewarm, it would be both soothing and would make my hands softer. #justsaying #weirdurges
197 2018-06-16 23:23:15 The heck? When I was working as a trainee chef we didn’t wash our meat because there’s bacteria in water (I think? This was 20 years ago), but water also doesn’t mix well with oil when in the pan.

200 2018-06-16 23:22:48 I’m not experienced with freeing mammals from glue traps; the oil disrupts the glue though, so in principal it should work! (And I just Googled it: yes, it works with mammals too!)
201 2018-06-16 23:22:46 Soybeans, corn, wheat, beef, pork, poultry, coal, crude oil, gas, medical equipment... the list go on.

205 2018-06-16 23:21:42 Ironic for a country that hates gay people they only want half naked men to wrestle each other in baby oil. Bit of a contradiction.

214 2018-06-16 23:20:00 I think the oil revenue the UK govrenment claws in will cover it.
215 2018-06-16 23:19:32 Maybe China should make a deal with Canadian oil. I bet that'll get Trump thrown out of office bigly.
216 2018-06-16 23:19:31 I wonder! if we ever run into the T&I funding crisis that we keep teetering on.. Would we rename arterial expressways for corporate sponsors? When I was a kid I always thought the Gulf Freeway in TX was named for Gulf Oil

children's medicines tasted awful.

Caster Oil, Vick's Vapor Rub, Rubbing Alcohol, & B.C. Powdered Aspirin.  That's it in the medicine cabinet.
225 2018-06-16 23:18:21 I’d guess it’s more than 200 years. Last I read, we had 8 times more oil than Saudi Arabia and that’s just the oil they know about.
226 2018-06-16 23:18:21 YouTube doesn't know me well. An ad for a Reiki course just popped up. I watched some dipshits who, presumably, paid some charlatan to hold his hands above her. Probably bought crystals from him and maybe some snake oil. #aura #bollocks
227 2018-06-16 23:18:02 There was a time when "hive mind" had a creepy, pejorative meaning.  Now it's a call to arms for people you haven't seen for over a decade to offer their opinion on the best place for an oil change....and that truly saddens me #facebook #withoutyouimnothing
228 2018-06-16 23:17:45 I had to pause the song and walk away....she didn't have to snatch my edges after I legit just put my tea tree oil in my hair
229 2018-06-16 23:17:35 Yes the NDP made a mistake: they didn’t fix the horrendous revenue system they inherited from the conservatives. It used oil windfalls to maintain artificially low taxes. If we taxed like ANY other province (including the conservative ones) we’d have a surplus NOW! #ableg
230 2018-06-16 23:16:55 There’s still a $500 billion oil deal that was stopped because of Obama’s sanctions on Russia for invading Ukraine which tillerson was involved in that he can profit from as soon as sanctions are dropped

248 2018-06-16 23:14:46 My guess is some sort of reactionary bounce early next week, then we go lower due to $ shortage. $ should strengthen, but rates held for a while (maybe drop) as money drawn to US. But to many moving parts, € mess, trade war, elections, oil.  $ is a mess, but look at the rest.

Y'all have been suckered by foreigners and are too ill-informed to know it. By the way, the US doesn't need  foreign oil, so why has the price gone up by a dollar in four weeks?

287 2018-06-16 23:08:52 Argentina's government delivers a Saturday night : Energy Minister Juan José Aranguren, one of the most controversial ministers of the administration, is out. He will be replaced by Javier Iguacel, who has a lower profile but lots of oil sector experience.
288 2018-06-16 23:08:50 Scotland's rich in natural resources, our food & drinks industry is 1 of biggest exports in UK! We would be in top 20 richest countries in the world & that's w/out N.

291 2018-06-16 23:08:31 Most people aren't accosted for sleeping in there cars, either. I've lived in my car. A guy I worked with slept in his 5 nights a week for a job until he made his situation better. People going to North Dakota for the oil boom do it.

293 2018-06-16 23:08:15 I tossed those with olive oil, parsley and some other spices.
294 2018-06-16 23:08:07 Because I shop on the app first to see what aisle things are on, I was able to catch the higher price of my oil diffuser.. and the cashier adjusted the price. I love target lol. They’re the chick-fil-A of retail

297 2018-06-16 23:07:10 If a lid is kept on oil, lng, korn, and gold prices, it could happen. Like you, I don't think it is possible. I also don't think it is going to be expediate and will probably coincide with the next commodity "super" cycle.

306 2018-06-16 23:05:59 Times will change u watch them now realise how much tax can be made from this glad to see this poor child will now hopefully recover and be back home and to the thousands that need this oil to get through one day at a time

328 2018-06-16 23:03:09 All I had to do today was laundry & dishes. Instead, I...
-organized my Christmas wrapping paper
-washed bathroom walls
-researched cannabis oil in mascara
-installed a new garage door opener 
-went through 10,000 pics & ordered prints of 77 pictures 
-didn’t do dishes or laundry
329 2018-06-16 23:03:09 Russia gets about 60% of her federal revenue from oil and gas sales. Why would Putin want a POTUS that wants to expand domestic oil and gas production>  Or a POTUS that wants to increase defense spending? Fact is, dems make Russia richer and stronger.
330 2018-06-16 23:03:00 Oil money!
331 2018-06-16 23:02:58 Both resultant of burnt oil...
332 2018-06-16 23:02:41 People have been predicting the demise of oil since the early 1970s.
Today, 
More people use petroleum and related products than ever before. There are 270 million vehicles in the US, replacing them with EV will take many decades if not centuries.
333 2018-06-16 23:02:28 Potable water is the new Oil
334 2018-06-16 23:02:22 I meant weed on the streets. They must be growing shed loads to reduce to an oil. Be interested in knowing what happens in the process to see what's left at the end.
335 2018-06-16 23:02:08 Still perfect. 
336 2018-06-16 23:02:05 I couldn't agree more. I don't remem voting my tax dollar to be given away to any other countries. Every country has sothing to bring to the table. Africa-two bushels of grain for 2 Karat of diamond. Mid East - two bushels of grain for two barl of oil. We are not a world welfare.
337 2018-06-16 23:02:03 @BBCNews   todays news article on the BBC News website on the use of cannabis oil for the severely epileptic little boy states  that the cannabis oil obtained  from Canada contains THC. The oil obtainable in Canada for rare forms of Epilepsy contains CBD (non psychoactive).

339 2018-06-16 23:01:32 Because they mix like oil and water. One is true. One false.
340 2018-06-16 23:01:22 At the same time accurate statistics must be kept from this point forward so that we don't have people selling snake oil and much training and sharing of information in a open network is very much needed

345 2018-06-16 23:00:21 the rational explanation is that oil/gas fires are a lot harder to control/put out, but ever since i was a little kid ive always felt like kitchen flames and whatnot are forcibly contained and that they WANT to spread and cause harm, whereas wood fires are content to just burn

351 2018-06-16 22:58:33 Correct,  north for Russian Soviet oligarchs ( Jew), not much benefit in north as south oil field, after sucking oil 20y Iran shah realised, he start opposite British n zio,  so they poisened him n sent him to exile, they replaced him with islamic revolution n shia government.
352 2018-06-16 22:58:15 What to use in Lieu of Pesticides? Neem Oil, Garlic & Clove Oil, Azatrol, StrawFlower Extract... the list goes on!
353 2018-06-16 22:58:07 Ooo maybe! Never thought of using oil

357 2018-06-16 22:57:42 Of course the world cup is geopolitical.

MBS spent the entire game discussing oil with Putin during the Russia vs Saudi Arabia match on Thursday.

Last I checked, oil was a geopolitical issue.
358 2018-06-16 22:57:38 Cup of olive oil , put clean wrap over it and poke holes. They’ll go into it. Shit really works too. Used to do it when I worked at Jamba since we had so much fruit
359 2018-06-16 22:57:33 Norway has an oil fund. Scotland has got one too, but it's called the M25, Crossrail, the Olympic Park, the Windsor Castle restoration and fixing big Ben, as well as the refurbishment of Westminster. I've probably missed a thousand more projects we paid for you. Oh HS2 as well

369 2018-06-16 22:55:38 Wrong, we will hit peak oil by the 2050s & climate change is to dire of a situation to ignore, a green revolution would generate trillions in economic growth & as a self identified ancap, you should push for that & i’m done dealing with you
370 2018-06-16 22:55:31 Be very clear on this. No matter what bill if any passes the immigration debate will not end.

372 2018-06-16 22:55:19 I swear by oregano oil, cleared an infection in my gums around my wisdom tooth that antibiotics couldn’t kick - just kept reoccurring.  It is also great to steam w/ when you have a cold - pot of boiling water on the stove and a few drops of oregano oil (careful it can be spicy)
373 2018-06-16 22:55:11 ugh! I scalded my hand with boiling water and now it's blistering up and it hurts like hell.

380 2018-06-16 22:53:31 Scotland does not have control over any oil and gas reserves for example. The money generated from the oil and gas sector (which I believe only makes up 1% of our GDP if I remember correctly) has went continually into funding London’s wars.
381 2018-06-16 22:53:24 .....he of course is an oil painting
382 2018-06-16 22:52:54 Perhaps an oil would work? (I have no experience with body paint. )
383 2018-06-16 22:52:25 Thank you for exposing the antics of #GeorginaDowner. It is not just climate change questions she is blocking, also questions regarding oil drilling in the Bight, her desire to abolish the minimum wage etc. She is also a member of the IPA which advocates for the sale of the ABC.
384 2018-06-16 22:52:20 The only snake oil salesmen I'll trust
385 2018-06-16 22:52:15 Obama allowed our oil reserves to be used. They can determine how much or how little is produced. Yes in the beginning it was thx Bush jr. & yes it fluctuated. Oil still had a steady decline & stayed low for his last term. Ump owns stock in DAPL. Follow the money follow the oil.

436 2018-06-16 22:45:57 What a idiot not the point of buying a new one, they get away with this all the time, mine wasn't fit for the bin when I took mine, full of oil and wheels fell off! Want to have more respect for people's belongings

439 2018-06-16 22:45:24 War criminal hefter's terror organization is struggling with man power, stretched thin, they ordered border patrol to join the fight at oil crescent area. Also It's clear that, lack of air support for third day now, by UAE, France & Egypt, made hefter terrorists ineffective!
440 2018-06-16 22:45:19 Everybody fuckin wants oil dude, I'm only asking why
441 2018-06-16 22:45:06 Sigh. It's not her thing. But my dad worked on oil rigs when I was a baby, so I guess I was under the impression that she had some understanding of the industry. 
442 2018-06-16 22:44:51 That ol' snake oil really do burn..........
443 2018-06-16 22:44:50 Sana oil :------(
444 2018-06-16 22:44:06 Except the press slandering Elon and Tesla is anything but free.
My bets are on the oil industry financing those shameless hit pieces.
445 2018-06-16 22:44:06 Try living without electricity, it will be uncomfortable, no try living without oil, diesel, gasoline...impossible. Transportation will stop, food shortages everywhere especially in northern countries where we only have a 3-6month growing season.
446 2018-06-16 22:44:05 Grapeseed + castor oil is a life changer.

452 2018-06-16 22:42:45 The people orchestrating this are parasites feeding on ??? Yes OIL
453 2018-06-16 22:42:29 One drop of oil can render up to 25 litres of water unfit for drinking.
454 2018-06-16 22:42:20 It has to do with the oil trade, but yes it went way down during Obama’s last 2yrs. Cause I got laid off from my oilfield job. I Don’t hate Obama over it though. Part of
455 2018-06-16 22:42:15 Your government doesn't seem to believe in the clean growth opportunity either. You are allowing oil sands emissions *to increase* and just bought a bitumen pipeline, claiming that the environment and the economy go hand in hand.
456 2018-06-16 22:42:06 No he wouldn't according to the Bible Jesus said "For you always have the poor with you, but not always do you have Me" (John 12:8) when a woman rubbed expensive oil on his face on the way to crucifixion 
457 2018-06-16 22:41:37 The price is setting for highs on the $ lows for oil.
In this scenario I expect the monthly trend to be broken and price rally up to take out the weekly supply, then retrace back to test the weekly demand created and it will be good to go long and ride to monthly supply area.
458 2018-06-16 22:41:35 You know how when you make burgers (*flips hair*) that oil be coming for you like Liam Neeson in Taken

470 2018-06-16 22:39:27 Lol all I was saying was gas prices were high under obama at certain times, yet I get attacked. There’s no argument that the prices of oil fluctuate here and there. The sensitivity on here smh

484 2018-06-16 22:35:46 @Oil_Ranger Oh, Oklahoma, where they voted down tornado shelters in public schools because it was too expensive. That explains a lot.
485 2018-06-16 22:35:41 If we are using our oil resources that is why the price is so high
486 2018-06-16 22:35:23 Are you unhappy with your body wash because it dries your skin out ? Put a few tablespoons of baby oil in it. Shake before each use!
487 2018-06-16 22:35:05 People don't understand that here in El Paso when it rains it's bad to drive fast cause it mixes with the oil so it's very slippery in like the northern states that get rain all the time slow down and take your time no need to be in a hurry at all

492 2018-06-16 22:34:19 Part of stupid @MobilePunch & other reckless fake news organisations to sow chaos/discord in Nigeria. Christmas time it was oil sabotage, Eid-El-Fitr "fake power outage". Surely all enemies (both internal/external) of Nigeria are doomed to failure.
493 2018-06-16 22:34:09 I also like roasted red pepper blended with walnuts and oil. Out of interest are you trying low FODMAP as you think intolerant to something else? I started on low fodmap and then had blood tests and tested positive for coeliac. Now not really sure where to go with fodmaps now!

498 2018-06-16 22:33:30 CBD oil being illegal is like making Tylenol illegal, like what? Tylenol actually is harder on your body than CBD oil! Idk why people wouldn’t allow a miracle cure with no side effects to be legal .. wth

500 2018-06-16 22:33:27 It's the same for pain meds they would rather put you on opiate based drugs which are highly addictive. When cbd oil works just as good if not even better.
501 2018-06-16 22:33:20 340,000 you say? Ha ha you must be talking nonsense! No way could a country that small be independent? I mean we are Scotland with a mere 5,500,000 people, oil, whisky, fish and tourism and we can’t do it, so what’s the secret? 

Wake up guys.
502 2018-06-16 22:33:08 Depends on the commodity. Corn mainly used as livestock feed, others less so. Most pulse & lentil production is exported for food use. Oilseeds exported for oil & the meal goes into animal feed. Cereals exported for food and animal use.
503 2018-06-16 22:32:49 Wow. Seriously intense brutal and brutally erotic #MixedWrestling session tonight. Oil. Topless. Handcuffs. Happy ending. Rock music loud as fuck. He'll never forget me.... don't think I'll forget HIM! Soooooo handsome!! 
504 2018-06-16 22:32:30 I'm just cracking up that this lady is wasting money on cooking oil when she could just get some lime powder from a construction store and water from her tap or well or whatever.
505 2018-06-16 22:32:05 We are not communists. A private company should not be nationalized. See how Venezuela handles state run oil.
506 2018-06-16 22:32:05 Oops. Now you’ve pulled back the curtain that hides the truth! The Great & Mighty Oz is just an aging snake oil salesman.

510 2018-06-16 22:30:48 I’m so bloody happy for Charlotte Caldwell and her boy Billy. The passion and clarity of her campaign could only end with her getting the medicine (cannabis oil) for Billy. She’s a force of nature, meeting her was inspiring.
511 2018-06-16 22:30:26 Me and him? We’re like oil and water- two different substances
512 2018-06-16 22:30:24 Secular Europe and Islamic theocracy are like oil and water. But the leaders will keep spouting platitudes and praise for the latter in effort to discourage the violence. #Trudeau gave a similar speech in Canada. Strange days.
513 2018-06-16 22:30:10 Educate and trump supporters like oil and water
514 2018-06-16 22:30:05 I can’t believe it’s not legal there!! That’s crazy! & that’s horrible , I’m sorry! They make cbd oil creams too they could definitely help with that! Idk why it’s illegal in the first place. I think people think it’s like weed , it’s not like it gets you high or anything lol
515 2018-06-16 22:30:02 Run a comb over a bar of soap in the shower and run it down your clog from top to nipple. It helps break up the clog and feels amazing. Also, if you have an electric toothbrush (or vibrator) that helps too. And castor oil packs. Are you on Facebook? There’s a great BF group

518 2018-06-16 22:29:29 Actually, our oil output has increased in recent years. In the very recent past we were dependent on the Middle East for much of our oil, but last I heard, we currently export more than we input.
519 2018-06-16 22:29:19 They're expecting pizza while super eagles are preparing lite palm oil rice.
520 2018-06-16 22:29:15 Good to know you think more of yourself and the joke og a party you represent than you do about the world and the country your supposed to govern. Why haven't you intervened in the inhumane treatment of Palestinians and Yemenis? Oh yeah thats how you control the oil!!

522 2018-06-16 22:28:52 The monoculture environ of a palm oil plantation with palm oil trees befits the bleak notion of a 'blandscape' whereby a #rainforest -a natural 'laboratory' of #biodiversity - has been destroyed and animals like orangutans killed. #palmoil @DrBirute
523 2018-06-16 22:28:35 Keep your blood pressure low but your oil pressures high
524 2018-06-16 22:27:53 If it were followed we wouodnr be in this mess. That's the bankers and elite who owned those like the Bush twats, obama, Clinton, and even communist Occidental oil owner al gore and his father. It's a select few doing it. The govt isn't your friend. And debt is run up on purpose
525 2018-06-16 22:27:48 We want it, but the rulers of the majority of Islamic reg r united with the US to sell their OIL, because they don't have any source of income except OIL. They have been colonized by the US and UK for years, and their WAHHABI rulers r ransoming US for fear of being destroyed.
526 2018-06-16 22:27:33 Outside of Gary Richardson’s antics, the Republican primary for Governor has been way too friendly. Hardly any negative TV ads. I wonder if the candidates have deals with the oil overlords to play nice?
527 2018-06-16 22:27:02 Hot oil splattered all over my stomach and thigh and the burn marks are not going away
528 2018-06-16 22:26:48 @TxHistComm Oct 6, 2018 75th Anniversary Celebration The Big Inch Pipeline which shipped Texas oil products to Europe and helped win WWII is honored at ETX Oil Museum in Kilgore. Please attend!
529 2018-06-16 22:26:33 also, don't fry them in oil, just make them on a non-stick pan/griddle.
530 2018-06-16 22:26:23 I was a Republican, @EWErickson. Somewhere around the time my party nominated a snake oil salesmen and basically, soulless human being to lead our party, I bailed.  I’m proud to be on the right side of history. I’m so disappointed. I thought we were better, we aren’t.
531 2018-06-16 22:26:22 lemme clean & oil yall guns for yall, i got some 
532 2018-06-16 22:25:50 Trump would have the pipelines build and oil out with jobs and cheaper gas. What politicians are supposed to do.Not attend parades. 
Reel class act. Bullying a person who is attending a family funeral. No place for extreme radicals that bring hate. Its ok for lgtb to spresd hate?

537 2018-06-16 22:24:42 so i made this body shimmer oil for my sisterwife and i think i might start selling it 
538 2018-06-16 22:24:32  I’m not really sure where I stand on legalising cannabis across the board to be honest, I hate the stuff but in cases like this, I don’t really see an arguement to not allow the Cannabis Oil for medicinal purposes. 
Hopefully her Son comes out of this ok 
539 2018-06-16 22:24:21 Im vegetarian, but one thing I don't understand about vegans is that they think it's okay to use oil based synthetics, where the raw product takes millions of years to replace itself, and contributes to the long slow death of our host body planet. An animal takes a couple years.
540 2018-06-16 22:24:17 The Russian mercs are also involved in classical imperialism rather than the more modern US capitalist version. Like they were seizing oil fields a and phostphate mines for a cut of the profits.
541 2018-06-16 22:23:05 XD.

I guess that's fine but I can't help but feel that eggs would taste kind of weird after spending 9 months submerged in oil.
542 2018-06-16 22:22:46 But that’s what religion is for? All of the biggest wars are over religion or stuff. “What? They don’t worship the same God that we do? And they have oil? BOMB THEM”. That’s how it works
543 2018-06-16 22:22:39 #OIL
544 2018-06-16 22:22:24 What ?
545 2018-06-16 22:22:21 I did my darnedest to cleanse, exfoliate, mask, serum,oil and moisturize away my head-achy blues..  It sort of worked.
Now I am gearing up to prepare a few meals so I dont have to cook when it is freaking 90 out.
546 2018-06-16 22:22:14 we still on that visqeen and baby oil up in Winona ......too easy
547 2018-06-16 22:22:13 Been busy, Slick. I work now. 
548 2018-06-16 22:22:08 I'm getting my oil changed and their internet sucks @firestone  fix it! BEY just released an album 
549 2018-06-16 22:21:41 Try oil of oregano!! Look it up!!
550 2018-06-16 22:21:12 You’re welcome.  Tryin!!   I’m currently recording former inmates’ stories (so moving!), & scanning old family photos & archival documents. Also make oil paintings of the people —. all for an exhibition. Prisoners to Paper dolls. NV, TX, & GA so far!
551 2018-06-16 22:21:10 #Pressurewasher Tips: Always check the oil and gas levels on a gas power washer. Only use unleaded gasoline.
552 2018-06-16 22:21:10 Doug Ford wants to regulate gas prices at the pump which is kind of insane considering they’re based on global oil prices and supply and demand. Price signals drive behaviour; the environment is an externality that the market doesn’t account for.
553 2018-06-16 22:21:06 알리제 너무 귀여워
554 2018-06-16 22:21:05 Your Head Get Oil. 
555 2018-06-16 22:20:52 My mom's from Asia and my dad's from Ecuador. I have a heart but we came legally and it's not fair to us. It also isn't fair for them to leech off American taxpayers.
556 2018-06-16 22:20:47 NOT A LAW.
TRUMP POLICY.
NOT the DEMOCRATS.
Republicans CONTROL House, Senate & President.
You obviously drank Trump’s vile snake oil.

560 2018-06-16 22:20:36 So, you think the Supreme Court deciding whether or not the government can prohibit citizens from accessing social media is the same as a private company deciding who can use their platform? Cool. Btw, Standard Oil wasn't declared a utility, it was a monopoly that was broken up.
561 2018-06-16 22:20:19 There seems to be more things wrong with the kid. Hope the cannabis oil doesn’t come with a side effect which will manifest itself later in life.
562 2018-06-16 22:20:05 You do realize the president has no say in gas prices.  Greedy oil companies do.
563 2018-06-16 22:19:56 About to attempt my first solo oil change. Let's make sure I don't die or mess up my car.
564 2018-06-16 22:19:47 Jay and Nas fans not stans are oil and water for sure
565 2018-06-16 22:19:43 The Home Secretary is no hero for using ‘special powers’. The oil was taken away from the boy lad when it clearly made his life more comfortable.
566 2018-06-16 22:19:39 I suspect so.
And because those siphoning off the bulk from high oil prices can’t spend keep it all or stash it all outside the Nigeria, when what they leave or spend here trickles down, we delude ourself that this house built on sand represents growth & development.
567 2018-06-16 22:19:18 short gold, short eurusd, short audusd, long usdjpy, sell corn, sell bonds on rips, sell oil, buy usdnok---this is the theme. spx is a mystery lol.
568 2018-06-16 22:19:00 全ての料理はオイルなしに作れない…(作れるのもあるかも、え、あるのかなぁ)
569 2018-06-16 22:18:51 I take the money I get from oil and donate all of it to people who need it - not that it is any of your damn business!
570 2018-06-16 22:18:50 There's no harm in asking Mr Spinty about this Oil but as the home Secretary said - he was only releasing it as it was a medical emergency.
You could always ask for a VNS or Deep Brain Stimulation.
571 2018-06-16 22:18:48 His birth rocked oil ships and caused an oil spil
572 2018-06-16 22:18:42 How does this happen? Do y’all drink motor oil?
573 2018-06-16 22:18:25 @debbieflint Will Ultrasun ever formulate an oil SPF?
574 2018-06-16 22:18:07 @Robert Hii - An alternative to Palm Oil is being studied at University of Bath ~ yeast Metschnikowia pulcherrima – no job is worth suffering and murder of two species of animals in my opinion
575 2018-06-16 22:18:04 Got some pork marinading in  EV olive oil, garlic puree, salt , pepper, oregano, ground cinammon, cloves, ground nutmeg and lemon juice.
sourdough pittas.
Skewers at the ready,
Doing a wee souvlaki and greek sides tomorrow.
576 2018-06-16 22:17:47 Of course! And the coconut oil helps with that too!!

582 2018-06-16 22:16:52 But he is...a rancid snake oil collected from his own person...salesman.
583 2018-06-16 22:16:46 For those who want more info & the truth about how the EU has destroyed our fishing industry, resulting in 100’s of 1000’s of jobs & destroyed coastal communities & how they’ve systematically asset stripped us of both Fish & oil, go to @fishingforleave
584 2018-06-16 22:16:39 Thank you @DouglasOllivant

Higher oil prices can provide the wherewithal to start the repair but they can also provide the easy way out as I point out. See footnote 15 about the risk and damage that this can do.
585 2018-06-16 22:16:38 One of my patients yesterday told me viagra was $1000 for 9 pills...... & that was the beginning to me selling my first intimate arousal oil from our shop lol
586 2018-06-16 22:16:08 I heard they found traces of oil in Jamaica. Whatever happened to that story?
587 2018-06-16 22:16:07 It is amazing, without question, but I’m yet to see how we can keep it up when oil becomes scarce & expensive.
588 2018-06-16 22:16:03 The amount of tanning oil on this beach would make a dermatologist blush
589 2018-06-16 22:15:48 the UK post brexit would be better off looking East rather than west with Trump at the helm of the US and likely to get a second term trade deals are a pipe dream we already get most of our Gas from Russia they have an awful lot of Oil that we need as well

593 2018-06-16 22:15:20 See just how duplicitous the Tory party is. One of their MP’s husband has a licence to grow cannabis for big Pharma, yet they denied an ill boy the right to use the oil. That is until they were shamed into allowing it by twitter.
594 2018-06-16 22:15:12 Synthetic oil, carbon fiber, produced using solar and wind energy?  That would be a trick.
595 2018-06-16 22:15:02 OIL AND GAS GUY - LABOUR - HUGH GAFFNEY.........NO WORDS.. obviously someone has written out these questions...coz they don't understand them..
596 2018-06-16 22:14:50 Wow...somebody that understands the dollar reserve currency system of the world.  Other nations must purchase oil from OPEC using dollars.  How do they get dollars? Trade for the dollars we print.  If Petro-dollar abandoned, Inflation in USA 1000% overnight.
597 2018-06-16 22:14:27 Ehn ehn... Fight koor, Forte oil nii
598 2018-06-16 22:14:09 I have to get an oil change and my anxiety is high because I know there's lots wrong with my car
599 2018-06-16 22:13:53 I consider myself to be a somewhat reasonably wise person, so take it as unduly bestowed wisdom when I say, you’re gonna be better off in life if you have a little side container of super virgin olive oil thats seasoned with red peppers and Italian seasoning and garlic and shit.
600 2018-06-16 22:13:32 "real numbers that are actual." Anyone who makes that statement shows little understanding of oil transport and storage. Probably believes levels are measure with 'dipsticks'. With full access to instrumented storage and vessels it is difficult. W/o that, it's next to impossible.
601 2018-06-16 22:13:28 I think we should stick to selling oil

609 2018-06-16 22:12:46 @BMW Excellent experience with Roadside Assistance last night/this morning after a blown-out run flat due to a giant pot hole. Car was picked up on time this morning and towed 150 miles back to my dealer and I’m already driving the car with new tire installed and it’s oil changed
610 2018-06-16 22:12:42 Prolly Our most valuable export since crude oil
611 2018-06-16 22:12:42 @RSL_Studio I doubt an engine problem was the cause of the #17's accident, anything seizing at that speed would result in lots of oil & engine innards on the track. Looked to me like the cooling system was damaged in the crash & failed when repressurised. #Mobil1RLM
612 2018-06-16 22:12:30 As I remember @StenhouseJr blew his engine in the last corner of the last lap and Carl got in his oil and slammed into the back of him all while crossing the finish line. Spectacular finish that was. All back when nobody really knew who @StenhouseJr was. . . . Good times.
613 2018-06-16 22:12:04 Tbf I agree re: soy. We export most of our crop except for the oil.

615 2018-06-16 22:11:40 so, it's still just an indication of how obsessed he is with himself.  His interests include one thing... getting attention and praise and he'll lie and distort anything to convince the American people that he's perfect.  A perfect buffoon and snake oil salesman IMO.
616 2018-06-16 22:11:33 Use a primer and you're good. I use a primer oil.
617 2018-06-16 22:11:26 So over hearing older people preaching about how my generation spend their money; we’re over educated, burdened with debt to get there and poorly rewarded in our work...Couple that with over inflated house prices and costs of living and there is only oil on the ladder.
618 2018-06-16 22:11:23 This Saturday morning has been brought to you by coffee, a fat joint, peppermint oil and an orgasm.

And Kevin is so self-aware sometimes that you do almost expect him to be like “Well, that’s a.... a good point...”
622 2018-06-16 22:10:41 Just want to say good luck to my brothers tonight who are playing in the oil bowl. Wish I could be out with you both. @shane_h_74 @major3hayden be safe, and of course, have fun. 
623 2018-06-16 22:10:38 so is oil of every pearl's uninsides 
624 2018-06-16 22:10:34 Just as Trump's boss, Vladimir commands.  Oil prices must rise to make Daddy Vladdy richer.
625 2018-06-16 22:10:21 A lot of commodities are already up a ton. Oil is up >50%, copper >50%, lumber up 80%.
626 2018-06-16 22:10:12 Apparantly the opiates given to Billy did nothing, but we all know how effectively the Cannabis oil has worked for his seizures. This will go down in history for all those that insist we need more research

631 2018-06-16 22:09:26 What’s also sad is that Mexico should be one the richest countries in the Americas. They have oil, hard ass working people, everybody loves the stuff they export, etc. But we all know why they’re fleeing and that needs to be addressed. #cartels #governmentcorruption

633 2018-06-16 22:08:14 Moses dat was looking for crude oil
634 2018-06-16 22:08:08 I'd be expecting that monthly trendline to get taken out and a push higher to the monthly supply. So longs from daily/4hr demand, as someone said above AFTER the local supply has been taken out. EUR weak=DXY strong, oil weak=CAD weak
635 2018-06-16 22:08:07 Old layout for long oil. Brings back memories.
636 2018-06-16 22:08:04 Also olive oil and parmesan and some parsley
637 2018-06-16 22:07:59 Looks cool. Getting the New Nissan leaf next week. Petrol/diesel and horsepower taxes are to high in Norway, even though we produce alot of oil  go figure 
638 2018-06-16 22:07:33 @GazCoombes is on @BBCLater looking almost as young as he did in '96?!

There's definitely something in his Oil of Ulay.

639 2018-06-16 22:07:30 See this is what we need here...they want you to know the exact moment in time and where you were standing when the first drop of essential oil was pushed out the bottle to make this bar of soap, plus your social, first borns name, why your father isnt in the pic, what you ate.
640 2018-06-16 22:07:29 and were immediately removed from the investigation the minute #mueller came in.  You are a #liar and #fraud #DonTheCon selling snake oil to millions.  #manafort is not innocent, #flynn admitted to lying to #FBI which, in case you weren't told, is a CRIME.  #RussiaGate

642 2018-06-16 22:06:54 At some point, I thought Victor Moses wanted to discover crude oil 
643 2018-06-16 22:06:44 10k plus innocent children killed in a useless war based on his blind vengefulness and oil pissing contest, his admin's  lies and the  complacent if not complicit media that spewed them gets to me too.

650 2018-06-16 22:05:41 As interested in fee collection then your US house bill to impose fees on protesters against oil & gas projects on fed land needs to add groups like Cliven Bundy/sons that have cost US and states >10 million (Malheur National Wildlife refuge destruction + law enforcement).
651 2018-06-16 22:05:41 Snake oil and red herring. The only point that matters is this: economics is the order of power in the world. The United States and China are the world economy. Pick one (hint China doesn't have the freedom to resist and they prop up large business also)
652 2018-06-16 22:05:27 Idk why I thought putting oil on while floating all day would be a good idea for a ginger

656 2018-06-16 22:04:57 Yeah. Straight hair has less follicle usually and ita easier for oil to move through it while curly or kinky hair tends to he closer together so not as much oil can get out and its harder to reach areas due to the curls. Its neat.

660 2018-06-16 22:04:37 Yep I do. My teacher had us put peppermint oil behind our ears if we felt nauseous during class!
661 2018-06-16 22:04:26 Update: my dad was pissed at how much I paid for my oil change because I didn’t wanna wait at the cheaper place and that I paid someone to detail my car. Even though he told me he wasn’t doing it!   I’ll never understand the male species
662 2018-06-16 22:04:23 oil of every pearl's un-insides needed more squishy noises, but other than that it's a good album
663 2018-06-16 22:04:20 Everybody please check all of your cupboards and see all of the products you have that have palm oil as an ingredient. You might be surprised of all things you have. Ask yourself if these products you use and eat are worth the lives of the poor orangutans.

668 2018-06-16 22:03:31 I am fed up of this government, why do they want people to suffer, they enjoy what they are doing. There must be something if the people aren’t happy that they can do. It’s all nuts. There are people suffering, allow the cannabis oil Mrs May,you are NOT GOD.

676 2018-06-16 22:02:21 You know, Monopolies were Declared Illegal by a Judge. It involved Rockefeller due to his Oil Monopoly and Vanderbilt for his Steel/Railroad Monopoly. As a Result their Monopolies were split up to give others an opportunity as well. The Documentary"The Five Men that BuiltAmerica"
677 2018-06-16 22:02:07 Nike is to blame. They put a target on our backs, pitted us against the richest oil country in the world.

679 2018-06-16 22:01:41 Just got some Black Seed Oil. I need to see what all the hype is about 
680 2018-06-16 22:01:36 It's kinda fucked up, pooplady was my work nickname because no one knew how to clean fecal matter and body fluids properly, and stuff like that happened predominantly when I was on duty. Parents called me olive oil because I was tall, had a slick back bun, skinny and no tits.
681 2018-06-16 22:01:05 The government of Iraq has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Meryl Streep in a wigan wig.
682 2018-06-16 22:00:46 If there’s Yves Rocher in Norway u can buy it there. “Sabuni Raqi” is naturally made of “Laurel Leaf & Olive Oil” these r the 2 classical ingredients of the soap. I told u the ingredients so that maybe u could ask other brands if they have it.

688 2018-06-16 21:59:20 Yes! The braid trick and coconut oil on damp hair massage the scalp also!!
689 2018-06-16 21:59:12 I know it’s a plush, but FYI: Don’t feed your doggos pizza, dogs are lactose intolerant so cheese ain’t good for em, onions and garlic may be present in pizzas (also not good), certain mushrooms, sodium, oil, etc. And they’ll get fat.
690 2018-06-16 21:59:10 fun fact about yuuto: i have no problem with wood fires, but oil/gas flames terrify me. i can stick my hand straight into a campfire to move burning logs around, but just holding a lighter in my hand makes me feel like im gonna lose it
691 2018-06-16 21:58:55 remember to let ur hair rest afterward;;! use coconut oil or even better a hair treatment for at least two weeks post bleaching.
692 2018-06-16 21:58:39 well fire/heat does kill the buzz on yt oil unless you wake and cant hold your yt oil
693 2018-06-16 21:58:18 The way Victor Moses is going down, he will soon discover Oil.  Davido should just replace him and give Nigeria assurance

694 2018-06-16 21:58:09 Is it ok to use coconut oil on your face
695 2018-06-16 21:58:07 I mean if it’s an oil I wouldn’t expect it to go bad unless it had some kind of organics mixed in.
696 2018-06-16 21:57:37 I love robotic oil poffins~!
697 2018-06-16 21:57:19 Thanks going to try it! I’ve tried coconut oil and vitamin E oil and it’s still terrible 
698 2018-06-16 21:57:07 Personally, I think @ukhomeoffice Sec @sajidjavid thought “Hmmm, what would @10DowningStreet PM @theresa_may do?  I best do the opposite”. 

Now the kid has (limited) access to the oil he so badly needs.

704 2018-06-16 21:55:48 That #fridaynightdinner episode where dad spills oil on the carpet and the carpet cleaner dies 
705 2018-06-16 21:55:36 I treat my car better than I treat me. He got new tires, wipers, brakes, oil, a full tank today and about to get detailed on Monday.
706 2018-06-16 21:55:33 This is making the law up as you go along and it's a farce. There are other people suffering juts as badly and perhaps dying, who cannot get Cannabis Oil - why single out just one patient? To my mind that is no solution, this government is rudderless and senseless.
707 2018-06-16 21:55:23 I’m in Gab, it’s in its infancy, can see it growing, no guarantee that ‘oil’ money won’t take over, good aren’t ‘they’!  Sadly, We all need to wise up
708 2018-06-16 21:55:13 In summation:
1) Begin enforcing vagrancy laws. 
2) Open book quarterly audits of so-called “homelessness “ expenditures.
3)People of #Seattle, stop electing socialist snake oil salesthey.

717 2018-06-16 21:53:34 China does not import much light crude oil. It has hardly ever bought any from Nigeria, Algeria, NS and Med. Only place it does is from the US. It’s as if they are buying it for another reason than wanting the crude oil.
718 2018-06-16 21:53:30 The Saudis have oil...that did them no good until European explorers found it for them. The oil itself was not that useful until Westerners invented a combustion engine. The west made everyone else richer if anything

732 2018-06-16 21:51:22 Africa is the richest continent. We have abundant precious metals, oil, most productive soils, habitable weather and a people with the most resilient DNAs. Yet, billions of us have become mere consumers of what inferior climates and DNAs produce. We must fix that or we perish.

736 2018-06-16 21:50:29 Are you familiar with the "oil revenues" and how much the UK makes out of Scotland from that? Or the revenue from "scotch" whisky? Scotland isn't corn fed from the revenues raised in English call centres...

737 2018-06-16 21:50:24 No 
Boeing,Raytheon ,Lockheed Martin,Exxon other companies saw it profitable to destroy lives and make money since they are in the business of selling oil and weapons of war. 

You can see what happened to a place b4 US went in and after it went in .I think it's crystal clear .

779 2018-06-16 21:42:34 #Bbcpapers it would be nice if you reveal that cannabis based Sativex (CBD oil) is grown and produced inside the UK to be sold elsewhere. If the government has deemed it legal to grow/sell by a pharmaceutical company why is it not legal to use?!
780 2018-06-16 21:42:24 Doesn't know how to get out of Afghanistan and doesn't know how to depose the dictator of Syria, Assad.  Destabilized the area to where Israel has protestors they have to shoot outright. And that's all happening because big oil decided to use the usa as their personal body guard
781 2018-06-16 21:42:20 Well it helps to have crazy amounts of oil money, and they kind of uhhhh pillage, yes, pillage would be the word, the environment - you can get whale sandwiches, for instance.  They're still trying to come back from destroying cod fishing.  So. They aren't perfect.

786 2018-06-16 21:41:54 Yea he's got big oil behind him. Remember the fracking ban he lifted for his buddies after the people in Harris county spoke out because of health issues. @GregAbbott_TX is a profits before people kinda guy.

796 2018-06-16 21:40:50 No policy enacted in the last 4 years can account for the 100% rise in oil/barrel from the bottom when it was 35/barrel. I trade oil futures on the open market every week, this is all common knowledge. The supply graphs mark the bottom and current rising trend week for week.
797 2018-06-16 21:40:45 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. New York City sleeps.

814 2018-06-16 21:39:04 If you think Trump can raise oil prices from 50-70 in a little over one years time you give him way more credit than he is due. Again presidents of the US do not control the price of oil.
815 2018-06-16 21:38:53 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.

1. How does a manager field 8 defensive players?!! 
2.We have wingers , yet he put iwobi(our messiah) on the flank.
3. Mikel has no business in the opponents final third.
4.Set piece training!!

Groundnut oil is the man to blame.
818 2018-06-16 21:38:32 Important to note, will NOT result in firing of sessions and trump will NOT get funding of racist wall.

Also to add to outcome duality, getting wall means:
1. Campaign
2. Imminent domain - they want something on that border, I still have not figured out what yet (oil, minerals?)

Remove the fish from the faroes and they will be worse than us
821 2018-06-16 21:37:41 Supply cuts in vet the last two years caused prices to rise. Pretty sure there was more chaos in 2014 and 2015 with Libya, Egypt, Syria imploding and oil was 40/barrel then. Supply and demand. US oil fracking dumped an unprecedented supply on the market, took year to recover.

831 2018-06-16 21:36:16 So they can prescribe class A opioids but not Cannabis oil?
832 2018-06-16 21:36:05 I’m not one for conspiracy theories but I’ll just put this out there. 

Weed is going to be legalised in the UK before Brexit happens next year as a source of revenue. 

The charade of the Home Secretary stepping in to allow that lad access to cannabis oil, was a litmus test.

836 2018-06-16 21:34:34 That's just it taxing it. We not on about smoking joints here are we dave. Their are various forms ie the oil that is used in some countries & is proven in medical conditions. They need to wise up to natural remedies. LSD is another for manic depression. But that's for another..
837 2018-06-16 21:34:21 You were the one who entered my mentions lmao.

How's oil? How's human rights violations? How's human trafficking? How's money laundering for terrorist going? All good?
838 2018-06-16 21:33:48 That's a very good point Tom and have thought that also. I think the main problem with today's Muslim migrant is pushing their belief onto a Christian society. Oil does not mix with water.
839 2018-06-16 21:33:43 Venezuela failed because 95% of their industry is from oil. The price of oil has dropped over the last ten years in comparison to other markets.

When you talk about socialism you never mention Sweden, is it because it’s a success, I wonder?

844 2018-06-16 21:33:17 According to him, he uses rhizomes and blends them in a paste. Uses olive oil to form top layer to prevent oxidisation and seasons with salt and pepper and consumes as salad dressing. Orders rhizomes from internet and gets them greasy from India.
845 2018-06-16 21:32:38 What an oil lobbyist you are. Only job you have had?
846 2018-06-16 21:32:34 What did u use as lubricant?! In all seriousness, I have used stuff before like Vaseline which has acted like an oil and fried them! You need a special sun cream lipsalve!

853 2018-06-16 21:31:34 Definately.  I’m missing being there.  The smell of the burnt oil, the roaring engines through the night, the hangover on Saturday morning which clears just in time for the start of the race.  I’ll bring Zach and the camper!  
854 2018-06-16 21:31:09 Just when I thought I fell off nah I just used too much baby oil gel that cocoa butter shit but that intensive Vaseline lotion that you can spray made shit #SLIPPERAY  

Dang really did not wanna go outside 
#THATDAY 
855 2018-06-16 21:31:02 Part of it is oil companies taking advantage of summer driving. They always hike up the prices during the summer. The trade war would give them a bonus reason to raise prices and make even more money.

857 2018-06-16 21:30:55 UK gvt spending hours debating/passing a ‘upskirt’ law while Billy lies in a hospital bed with seizures because the oil he needs isn’t legal! Seriously!!!
858 2018-06-16 21:30:54 Charlotte Caldwell tells @bbc5live Nolan that cannibas oil must be given to the hundreds of other children in the UK who medically need it . 

“We need to give back the children in our country their right to life”
859 2018-06-16 21:30:52 @JoeLobsinger mana powder mark 5 looks interesting tbh. They finally got rid of the oil it looks like. I still need to drink the jimmy joy I got a couple weeks ago… I have a hard time committing to these drinks.
860 2018-06-16 21:30:50 Thank you!! And oh yeah round 2 tonight @ Oil Palace lol 
861 2018-06-16 21:30:42 Holy non sequitur...

863 2018-06-16 21:30:29 Getting the oil changed, tires rotated, and overall check up at the dealer on Cullen before our big adventure in 14 days across the good ‘ol US of A! Did a dog walk earlier this morning before hand and waited while eating In-N-Out for Cullen to be all ready to go.
864 2018-06-16 21:30:24 So tell me James, if you lived in Fort Nelson and worked in the Oil and Gas sector, which way would you vote and why?
865 2018-06-16 21:30:24 Oil pump my guess
866 2018-06-16 21:30:20 #CannabisOil oil on the news. A child with epilepsy depends on it and it was seized at the airport. Since then a "temporary licence" has been arranged. JUST LEGALISE IT FFS. But,alas, there's no profit in a healthy population for the medical mafia.
867 2018-06-16 21:30:18 @Jo_Bond   these types of cars were big in N Z until oil went up.  Whats not new now..oil goes up!!  No change there then!!
868 2018-06-16 21:30:17 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。
869 2018-06-16 21:30:01 coconut oil

871 2018-06-16 21:29:56 What a story

The destiny of a great oil rich country rested on the shoulders of a young pig.....
872 2018-06-16 21:29:44 where’s my oregano oil
873 2018-06-16 21:29:28 It's almost like the oil companies don't really care about the little guy at all..
874 2018-06-16 21:29:21 Yeah idk he should use some coconut oil and make everything look a bit neater that’s all it’d take
875 2018-06-16 21:29:12 The groundnut oil you rubbed on your mouth is already affecting you ..shut and go and sleep
876 2018-06-16 21:29:11 Today I changed the oil on my car. What stereotype did you break today? #strongindependentwoman
877 2018-06-16 21:29:10 It won't. Might have to play with the oil mixture a bit though
878 2018-06-16 21:29:01 And we were bashing Saudi that day not knowing we have so much in common.

We both wore green
Were outplayed by a team in red & white
We both have oil
Our teams consists mainly of dark guys
We are both bottom of our respective groups.
879 2018-06-16 21:28:46 Nothing if not thrifty, Hephaestos. I mean, why waste all that escaping heat? I have the feeling he'd have plenty of olive oil to hand too, but that's probably more information than you need.
880 2018-06-16 21:28:40 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other
881 2018-06-16 21:28:32 I want to send Anointing Oil to SuperEagles. I don't think this Russian soil is clean, I suspect Voodoo or village people 
882 2018-06-16 21:28:26 Happens to me every time, it’s annoying they tell me everything that’s supposedly wrong with my car when I only came for one thing! AN OIL CHANGELOL
883 2018-06-16 21:28:25 I have friends that have had their lives and health ruined from the BP oil spill.... To take advantage of these poor hard working people is beyond dispicable!  May they get what they deserve
884 2018-06-16 21:28:00 I'm bound to confidentiality agreements with work but I think it's safe to say that I believe cannabis oil should be trialled and tested for many different things.

I don't understand what the government is scared of.

Enjoy viewing!
886 2018-06-16 21:27:31 What? 
After all that time and effort?
No way!
Rosemary, garlic, salt, pepper and lemon. Add olive oil, wrap in foil, toss it on the grill.
Or you can just sashimi it.
Works great with trout!
887 2018-06-16 21:27:06 It’s a bad time when you’re trying olive oil to get the matted parts out your hair, will never get extensions again
888 2018-06-16 21:26:54 Please let’s talk about obama and Hillary since you want to play the stupid what about game. Tell me what laws have they broken? Hillary was dragged before Congress for 8 hours and they found nothing. The snake oil trump is selling you is rotten
889 2018-06-16 21:26:49 .@sajidjavid - there are many families who need cannabis oil for medical emergencies. Time for a rethink on medicinal marijuana and then let’s start to look at proper drug reform.
890 2018-06-16 21:26:41 if they close oil wells, we would see it
891 2018-06-16 21:26:26 These 2 engine fires were not the only F135 problems... oil flow management valve failure, several instances of turbine blades breaking off... And no, I don't know any other (modern) fighter engine that had so much reliability problems
892 2018-06-16 21:26:24 Ooh nice! My list is so long I just got so excited that I could bake again  I do have an apple & olive oil cake, some white chocolate & raspberry blondes and either a lemon or carrot cake at the top of the list though.
893 2018-06-16 21:26:21 @realDonaldTrump I hope china makes a meal out of your colon asshole you moron!  Like I said before I'd put tariffs on you!  An I shut the fucking oil off flowing south of the boarder and make #canada self sufficient an not import or export!
894 2018-06-16 21:26:21 Ils sont bizarres les gens qui retweetent des tweets de chiens tout mignons mais quand ils voient un chien dans la rue ils courent direct esh je comprend pas looooh
895 2018-06-16 21:26:13 This is a reporter from attorney general's office addressed to Criminal investigation Office Nalut, last year--after they confirmed 2 were imprisoned by militia in Nalut--asking them to hand over the Jabran... But today we are shown by Janjaweed as he leads attack on Oil crescent
896 2018-06-16 21:26:13 No, they are the stupidest rubes to ever fall off a turnip truck and you are just a trashy low class snake oil salesman.
897 2018-06-16 21:25:40 The point is severe epilepsy can and does kill. In the case in the news, the child's seizures have apparently reduced with Cannabis oil to practically zero, when little else was having an effect. So I think there's a case for prescribing.
898 2018-06-16 21:25:34 I did hair mask to nourish them back to some health (which I'm almost out of too) and they're still drier than they should be but I shouldn't put keratin oil after the keratin mask (bc it's not effective or some shit) so I should wait
899 2018-06-16 21:25:30 Btw he needs coconut oil
900 2018-06-16 21:25:23 It’s a powder paint from Mehron mixed with coconut oil. It only took about half to 3/4 of one bottle.
901 2018-06-16 21:25:19 I spilled mf olive oil on my sheets
902 2018-06-16 21:25:12 All I hear about Cannabis oil is how much good it does for people who are ill. Why don’t we just legalise it and then people make there own minds up 
903 2018-06-16 21:25:10 Coconut oil will also help it heal faster too.
904 2018-06-16 21:25:08 Where do you expect these "revenues" to come from the oil industry? LNG? Coal? Might be time to do some research on how much Canada subsidizes #FossilFuel and how much #FossilFuel pay in taxes or royalties. Minuscule "revenue" source is less then 2% of Canadian GDP.

907 2018-06-16 21:24:18 Cannabis oil to the rescue. Years of corporate manipulation coming to an end. More revelations coming
908 2018-06-16 21:24:16 Wait, I'm misremembering that. The CPU would top out at 170. I think the oil was about 140F.
909 2018-06-16 21:24:10 Your head has oil. I was just saying the same with a couple of friends.
910 2018-06-16 21:24:10 the hydro plumping serum seriously saved my skin's winter dryness, love the avocado eye cream, and the oil free cleanser!!!
911 2018-06-16 21:24:08 #BillyJoel deserves #cannabis oil and I see in my lifetime that #cannabis is legalised in the UK. 

May I make clear, however, that not everyone NEEDS it.
Cannabis can deal with #stress but it does not 'cure' an #autistic person.
Simply put, there is nothing to cure. 

@itvnews
912 2018-06-16 21:24:03 A little scrub is OK.  A vegetable oil soaked paper towel, rub over screaming hot grates, let oil burn off, repeat until grate is black like cast iron skillet is what I'm talking about.
913 2018-06-16 21:24:01 I think you'd probably have to take way too much THC oil or whatever to actually OD.
914 2018-06-16 21:23:56 No be hin fault, na person yam dey allow make person chook hand inside palm oil 
915 2018-06-16 21:23:49 Back in 2007 we were told that prices were going up because 'the oïl is running out' - I happened to know that was untrue because I'd just been transcribing company 1/2 year results and two of those were oïl companies who'd just found extra oïl.  We are being manipulated.
916 2018-06-16 21:23:47 Oil Rigs & Platform Barges are classified as special purpose ships and mentioned toll transiting amount figure might be real & realistic.
917 2018-06-16 21:23:46 Give me oil in my glass, keep me hallucinating
918 2018-06-16 21:23:44 Watching the news & I feel so happy for the lady who got her cannibis oil back for her Bairn,it should be legal,were such a backward country.#legaliseit.
919 2018-06-16 21:23:20 Watching the news how can the biggest exporter of medicinal cannabis in the world (UK)confiscate a boys cannabis oil that is obviously helping. Is it because the big pharmaceutical boys don’t have the patent ???
920 2018-06-16 21:23:18 The NL Liberal Party may have just stuck a piece of black tape over the oil / brake lights that are lit up on their #nlpoli dashboard.  Interesting times ahead .. but NL needs better faster.
921 2018-06-16 21:23:16 i tried oil pulling and it was AWFUL but my mouth feels cleaner than ever!
922 2018-06-16 21:23:14 Son of an African oil baron who never had to work for anything in his life. Thinks "the struggle" was marmalade running out before 7:40 in his old private school breakfast. Brexit and probably a smug prick.
923 2018-06-16 21:23:07 Congrats ! If you need me I'll be back in bed with a jar of coconut oil for the next...while
924 2018-06-16 21:23:05 If my son had been through hell because the government had confiscated his cannabis oil I wouldn’t be thanking the Home Secretary I’d be suing the sick, backwards bastards
925 2018-06-16 21:22:59 Scrub them and oil the hell out of them is what I’d guess.
926 2018-06-16 21:22:51 Why is cannabis oil banned for medical purposes, makes no sense
927 2018-06-16 21:22:49 Do you know what a single drop of oil can do to a water table?
928 2018-06-16 21:22:41 One smells like patchouli oil.
The other, like the mill creek.
929 2018-06-16 21:22:41 In one of my previous apartments, I had a submerged PC (mineral oil). I could get the oil temp up to 170F if I left it on overnight with the door closed. Would make my bedroom unbearable hot. Eventually the tank failed due to the heat and I had a 12-gallon mess to clean up.
930 2018-06-16 21:22:33 I'd ask you to shower also, I don't want oily greasy suntan lotion or suntan oil in my pool it clogs up the filter.
931 2018-06-16 21:22:23 Yeah but why fucking oil
932 2018-06-16 21:22:23 Neutrogena’s visibly clear and freederm’s face wash plus coconut oil are the best things I’ve ever done for my skins, it’s clear and glowing ! #clearskin

935 2018-06-16 21:21:36 UK Home Minister Sajed Javid has  permitted a British family to use cannabis oil (which is banned in the UK) for their son's epilepsy problems. The family says this treatment worked for him in Canada where they got the oil. It was confiscated when they returned
936 2018-06-16 21:21:22 @ukhomeoffice
I have asked my Doctor for medical cannabis oil for my condition only to be told no.
Can I now have my licence for cannabis oil or is it because I am not in the news so you will ignore me!

940 2018-06-16 21:20:48 Of course.  But if Iraq gets a longer "runway" for the transition from higher oil prices that's all too the good.  Unless the higher prices and (temporary) cash surplus keep leadership from making the hard choices.

949 2018-06-16 21:19:42 We would likely not “be allowed” to default because that will downgrade all provinces & increase cost of borrowing for the country. Instead the feds will step in to provide guarantees but we will effectively become a territory, losing voting rights and oil/mine revenue like 1934
950 2018-06-16 21:19:28 Slow the much oil e?
951 2018-06-16 21:19:26 Try saying that when you are doing a tonne a month of potato.
Cost of oil when blanching, wastage in weight of skin removed, quality and seasonality of potato, sugar levels in potato, staff labour, space for storage.

989 2018-06-16 21:12:50 Does anyone use MCT oil to loose weight? If so, how do you take it?
990 2018-06-16 21:12:49 #backinthedaywe put baby oil on our skin before we went outside. It took 1 minute for my pale German skin to burn, instead of 10! My sis was treated for skin cancer 20 years ago. There's probably no correlation.

It’s clean energy!
It’s renewable energy!
It’s non-polluting energy!
It works for homes and cars!
It’s safe!
It’s a total no-brainer!!
Oh wait! Republicans and big oil can’t make any money from it!!!
995 2018-06-16 21:12:06 I’ve been at Walmart for 3 hours waiting on them to put tires on my car and change my oil 
996 2018-06-16 21:11:57 Isn’t it a brand of motor oil?
997 2018-06-16 21:11:55 If Moses continues to fall like this in our second match... he will soon discover crude oil...
998 2018-06-16 21:11:53 It's so good!! Esp. with a good olive oil & fresh break.
999 2018-06-16 21:11:44 I personally go with a few drops of pumpkin seed oil as well. Not entirely fat free but provides a nice balance to the acidity of the balsamic
1000 2018-06-16 21:11:36 i need some fire ass oil 
1001 2018-06-16 21:11:32 after this oil change and car wash i ain’t doin shiiiiiiit else
1002 2018-06-16 21:11:20 Because BIG OIL pays BIG BUCKS and that’s all that matters to sickOs like Pruitt & POS
1003 2018-06-16 21:11:06 ObPedant: Most crude oil is formed in what used to be marine and estuarine deposits. While the organic matter would have had a few tree bits, they weren't the dominant fraction of oil biomass. You're thinking of coal.
1004 2018-06-16 21:11:06 Don’t worry ppl I’m currently getting my oil changed :-))
1005 2018-06-16 21:11:02 Until China and other Asian polluters clean up, we are being fools for destroying our economy just to satisfy green extremists.  Our efforts will achieve nothing positive.   Ford is correct.  Just look at what the green extremists have done to our oil export economy.
1006 2018-06-16 21:10:58 @RobPetroneTV what’s the name of the place featured on #restauranthunter that had the olive oil dispensery - and I think there was coffee too?
1007 2018-06-16 21:10:36 Youre weird if you get tuna in oil instead of water
1008 2018-06-16 21:10:35 Hi Kira, Unfortunately we will not be re-stocking the No Trouble (With Beards And Stubble) bear oil further. We have since stopped production on this seasonal Fathers Day treat. We are so sorry for any disappointment caused by this.

1013 2018-06-16 21:09:41 Poor Charlotte Caldwell fighting for live saving medical cannabis oil! As if struggling with a severely unwell child is not enough. Fair play to Savid Javid for his emergency intervention.
1014 2018-06-16 21:08:59 We have worked with emergency services to clear the overturned vehicles involved in a traffic collision on the #M25 anti-clockwise between J10 #A3 and J9 #A243 #Leatherhead. Our Sewrvice Providers are just treating an oil spillage and clearing some glass from the carriageway.

1019 2018-06-16 21:07:32 So we'll give smack heads methadone on the NHS but we won't give that poor kid oil from a natural plant to stop him fitting 100 times a day? Stop the world, I'm getting off.

1028 2018-06-16 21:06:58 Changing oil patterns is exactly the same as changing the length of the rough or how fast the greens.  Same course, tougher conditions.
1029 2018-06-16 21:06:56 It looks like Victor moses' shoe was made with oil cos the way he fell during the match ehn,it was just a misfortune #WorldCup

1035 2018-06-16 21:04:58 Me either, knew he was a snake oil salesman, couldn’t verify his birth certificte, locked up college records, smart Americans knew he was a shit sandwich.
1036 2018-06-16 21:04:47 Sorry, but I thought a Pastor Paul that built his HOUSE ON THE ROCK anointed our jersey... I'm not saying otherwise ooo, but what oil did he use... Groundnut oil abi Palm oil?

I'm asking for a friend
1037 2018-06-16 21:04:27 It’s also because of people using different oils/sunscreens & since oil doesn’t mix with the water it can “damage” the pool/clog filters after days collecting. The employee handled it poorly, though. Should’ve announced it to everyone if that was the concern.
1038 2018-06-16 21:03:59 Go on Billy Caldwell. Prohibition of Cannabis oil for medical use in the UK is a disgrace. Be strong little man 
1039 2018-06-16 21:03:52 We don't have any old chestnut oil, just the black stuff from the North Sea
1040 2018-06-16 21:03:34 How is the essential oil selling scam still going on? How have you crazy white girls not gotten bored yet?
1041 2018-06-16 21:03:32 i would rather drink crude oil and die than take a sip of black coffee
1042 2018-06-16 21:03:31 That would be unfortunate. I have the bath and shower gel, the Rose Otto body oil and a body lotion the same.
1043 2018-06-16 21:03:24 WE NEED TO LINK UP & COOK & BAKE TOGETHER  Besties reunite! I freaking love avocado. I use avocado oil for my face too hahah

1047 2018-06-16 21:02:59 The mortal danger is what the child is in when NOT taking his medicine. Most parents would go to extreme lengths to save their child’s life. What this mum did is pretty tame really. 

What mortal danger do you think cannabidiol oil poses?
1048 2018-06-16 21:02:56 Avocado on my Face
Hemp Oil on my Tongue
Papaya Seeds in my Colon


1049 2018-06-16 21:02:53 It works, it really does. Kinda of trains your body to live without the bad stuff. I wanted French fries yesterday but had a salad with double grilled chicken and olive oil dressing instead and I felt so full. Forgot all about the fries lol
1050 2018-06-16 21:02:43 What gov is afraid of is that when the public realise that cannabis oil can be used safely to medicate for many ailments instead of the poison used by the NHS pushed by the biggest industry in the world the pharmaceutical company’s then many in this industry will be redundant
1051 2018-06-16 21:02:38 The old chestnut was your first answer as predicted. I guess you supplied all the money to build and extract all the oil. Fish whop whop. The rest of your statement is flawed due to OIL. GET A GRIP
1052 2018-06-16 21:02:37 Girl try coconut oil 
1053 2018-06-16 21:02:28 Rub yourself down with carrots and baby oil. Duh.
1054 2018-06-16 21:02:14 SM is one more transfer payment to quebec.  
I would like a 270% tariff on foreign oil imports.

1061 2018-06-16 21:01:23 Probably! I've tried coconut oil before and wasn't too impressed. So I tried this bc it was relatively cheap
1062 2018-06-16 21:01:11 So, I always brine my shrimp before cooking - I defrost in water/baking soda, then toss in oil with salt and whatever other seasonings I’m using. On a tip from Chef Resha, I put a sprinkle of sugar in too. BRUH. They were so succulent with a hint of sweet - almost like lobster!!
1063 2018-06-16 21:01:05 Sorry ehn... God has a way of doing things... eat the pepper then imagine it's the meat spiced with pepper... then drink groundnut oil on top... 

Thank me later

1065 2018-06-16 21:00:47 y'all i was in sally's and this lady asked me what oil to use for her daughters hair, so she calls her over (she's like 10), and I continue telling them about what oil, and the little girl was like "I like your dress, and your personality!". it was soooo cute 
1066 2018-06-16 21:00:44 June 16, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.

1069 2018-06-16 21:00:28 How much oil had we extracted in the early 18th century, you buffoon?
1070 2018-06-16 21:00:17 Any oil based product should work similarly.  No?
1071 2018-06-16 20:59:57 Oil, fish, whisky, electricty, water, gas, agriculture, renewables etc. the only part of the UK that export more than it imports. The Midlands is in a trade defict what can you do?

1073 2018-06-16 20:59:44 Such a great feeling getting all new tires and a fresh oil change.
1074 2018-06-16 20:59:29 Fair and valid points, the only difference is with bowling, you have a standard lane. Yes you can change oil patterns, but with golf the basics change year to year.
1075 2018-06-16 20:59:27 #USOpen is getting out of hand. DJ is leaking oil and Rose and Stinson have that look. Balls rolling back on greens isn’t a good look and we’ve got 3 hours to go.

1090 2018-06-16 20:57:30 It's interesting that the parable of the talents begins the same passage that ends with I was in prison, I was sick, I was naked because I was in a grooming gang while trespassing, etc.

And in between the wise keep gathering oil (Wisdom/Holy Spirit), while the wicked play.

1094 2018-06-16 20:56:48 Just stand there waiting and when he comes out just casually mention he needs to lay off oil filled food?
1095 2018-06-16 20:56:45 I dye my hair a lot & it gets fried. I find the coconut oil is a good treatment.

1097 2018-06-16 20:56:24 For silky hair, mix 3 parts olive oil and 1 part honey. Put in microwave 30 sec. Apply to damp hair 20 mins with shower cap on. Rinse well!

1101 2018-06-16 20:55:53 When I was 9 years old, my parents decided to travel from Alaska to California to visit my grandparents. My dad worked on an offshore oil rig week on, week off. My mom hated to fly and decided that her and I would drive the 2,500 mile trip, and stop in WA on the way to visit her
1102 2018-06-16 20:55:17 Oil prices are going up though.
1103 2018-06-16 20:55:01 Evan changes Benny’s oil regularly
1104 2018-06-16 20:54:54 So you borrowed and spend the money for something that you haven’t yet exploited?

Chinese loans come that easy. They showed them a lake and told them there is oil there and that was it?
1105 2018-06-16 20:54:47 No popcorn because Pop is having none of that.  I like @Lavarbigballer but Pop and the Ball family is like oil and water.  It'll never happen.
1106 2018-06-16 20:54:33 @SchleicherKR Now first off I would like to discuss which weapons we shall be sending to the Ottomans and in what quantities in exchange for how much oil each.
1107 2018-06-16 20:54:22 Disgraceful when real drug addicts not only get methadone free but are usually still on drugs this oil has so many uses it should be legalised for people who find it helpful
1108 2018-06-16 20:54:10 You’re only a chef after you add olive oil as its boiling
1109 2018-06-16 20:54:02 What I can't get over is how many moving parts there are in this current crisis:

1) Putin wants to destabilize the US and Europe, ease sanctions, launder money, kill his enemies, and keep oil money rolling in to the Oligarchs who keep him in power. Trump is a useful puppet.

1111 2018-06-16 20:53:48 I’ve been taking CBD oil for PTSD and it has helped loads. I would certainly reccomend it be given to other veterans with PTSD.
1112 2018-06-16 20:53:41 Remember when we celebrated Thanksgiving while we water cannoned the native american people defending their water from possible oil contamination? Now we’re gonna celebrate #FathersDay while hundreds of small children cry themselves to sleep missing their parents. COOL.
1113 2018-06-16 20:53:36 Natural bug repellent:  Spray your dog with peppermint essential oil in water.  1/2 tsp peppermint essential oil mixed with 2 cups of water.

1123 2018-06-16 20:51:45 Vicks and chicken soup are the only medication my Mexican mom would allow me. Peppermint oil is good for runny nose. Lime juice or honey for a sore throat

1135 2018-06-16 20:50:45 With the volatility of oil markets & the fact that it is a finite resource it simply isn't as sustainable. I don't discount it's value & contribution to our economy.  But this govt uses it as a crutch instead of leveraging it for growth in other industries such as the fishery.
1136 2018-06-16 20:50:41 @lori4nier Remember your preaching about CO2. Use solar or wind. Don't use that dirty oil.
1137 2018-06-16 20:50:36 My cousin is using 70% CBD oil, I won’t say where she is getting it from as I think it’s not quite legal. Anyhow, she has cancer, since she had been on it, the rumours have shrunk and she has very little pain. She goes for her operation in 3wks to get primary site out.
1138 2018-06-16 20:50:26 Nigeria is not a poor country my dear!! Oil rich and rich culturally too!

1142 2018-06-16 20:49:50 When you stop using oil is when you have a reasonable argument. What you are really saying is you have enough oil for yourself and no one else deserves any.

1154 2018-06-16 20:47:35 Iran once had a 95-5% oil deal with the uk... Meaning Iran gets 5% of the oil recenues and the uk gets 95... How did the english get this deal? The uk fed the drug adicted leadership opium... That is the sort of Actions the iranian people look back on...
1155 2018-06-16 20:47:17 We deal in facts all right, labour died (in Scotland) telling tory lies.

We’ll keep our unicorn, our oil, our natural resources, our wealth, our desire to succeed and wish England well as a pariah in the word. See how trump treats you, then you may understand how scotland feels.

1165 2018-06-16 20:45:42 So the type of oil required in this case includes the THC, in which case it’s the high that works? Thought the medicinal ingredient was the CBD?

1220 2018-06-16 20:38:46 The price of oil is up significantly from when El Sisi became president, from 54$ a barrel to over 70$ a barrel. So this increase is to simply mitigate the increase in global price, doesn’t put a dent even in the cost of oil subsidies.
1221 2018-06-16 20:38:46 you can even see Victor Moses wants to discover oil

1234 2018-06-16 20:36:41 I doubt that's going to work. But a neat idea. Remember those wave bottles in science class? The food coloring dissolves in the water not the oil since it's water based. You'd have to find an oil soluable dye to color the oil.

1256 2018-06-16 20:33:30 1. No Oil in Israel, no reference to Oil in any of nascent  Zionist texts, incl Herzl's "The Jewish State"; therefore, the 'Oil' association is a libel.

2. Since u 'know'... a Q. for u:
The concept of "the gathering of the diaspora" - 'Kibbutz Galuyot': #Judaism or #Zionism?
1257 2018-06-16 20:33:28 Problem is that many don't understand that even with massive improvements to our infrastructure no where near "full employment" is possible, especially when/if all the wars for oil & money end -then at best in the USA - our current 42% unemployed adult rate will remain the same!

1282 2018-06-16 20:31:15 The amount of oil that my face produces through out the day could fry up your breakfast
1283 2018-06-16 20:31:05 Real talk: If North Korea had oil we’d already be at war with them.
1284 2018-06-16 20:30:57 See what your GOAT cannot do ... Ororo no be crude oil, Nkwobi no be GOAT.
1285 2018-06-16 20:30:49 Went in for an oil change and ended up dropping $200  I hate taking care of cars
1286 2018-06-16 20:30:48 Dammit!! That’s ridiculous!! Palm oil is being added to extend the shelf life of stuff. We’re going to have to readdress the way we make good choices and eat food to make a difference.
1287 2018-06-16 20:30:46 If anyone can explain why I'd have an easier time raising the dead than finding anything less than an spf 15 tanning oil that'd be super. And spare me the lecture about my skin, says my liver.
1288 2018-06-16 20:30:44 Sure that's oil
1289 2018-06-16 20:30:39 use coconut oil

U.S. oil prices drop to lowest finish in over a week

1294 2018-06-16 20:30:04 Potatoes are victims. We force them to grow underground then one day we rip them from their beds and slice them into fries and drop them into hot oil. It is.... The Tatercaust!
1295 2018-06-16 20:29:50 Oil pipeline companies are constructing new pipelines which will carry some of the dirtiest oil on the planet, reducing our chances of avoiding the worst impacts of climate change and affecting millions of people worldwide. Don’t fund these pipelines!
1296 2018-06-16 20:29:33 I feel you.. I’ve been thinking it for a minute... but the thing is.. the Nasir album is just like oil and water.. the bars are fantastic, and the beats are fantastic. They just don’t mix well, they feel like they on 2 totally different wavelengths a lot of the time
1297 2018-06-16 20:29:27 Israel is a parasite on the uninformed US taxpayer who hands out $3.8 billion every year to the apartheid regime. The same regime that steals oil and water from the Golan Heights and the West bank, along with land and gas! Israel is a terrorist, apartheid, parasitic state!
1298 2018-06-16 20:29:24 Baby oil, enak kalo buat bersihin lipcream/liptint. Kalo buat seluruh wajah mending pake micellar atau milk cleanser aja.-.
1299 2018-06-16 20:29:11 What's with the tension on Twitter? Pragash just realised sumrah has been lying to him in "I need a wife" on Zee World. I can't kill myself over #CRONGA #WorldCup #SuperEagles . Fidelis top oil in the gen 
1300 2018-06-16 20:29:10 What is cbd oil for? Does it counteract with other medicines?
1301 2018-06-16 20:28:58 Just shouted and called the frying pan a little bitch because it spat some oil at me which burnt. Craaaazyyyyy Saturday night
1302 2018-06-16 20:28:55 Ahhhh winter... Where the coconut oil is in solid form again and I can drink ice water straight from the tap
1303 2018-06-16 20:28:40 Why is there fried chicken inside palm oil?
1304 2018-06-16 20:28:23 The rate at which Victor Moses is going down he might just discover oil. #CRONGA
1305 2018-06-16 20:28:21 "Dustin Johnson leaking a little oil"
Good analogy fox golf guy
1306 2018-06-16 20:28:08 I don't know if he's searching for oil o

Otisumi
1307 2018-06-16 20:28:08 If this was a Liberal war against Alberta oil, why pretend to care? They'd take Jagmeet Singh's position and reject TMX. Instead Trudeau is aiming for a compromise: AB takes action on climate change *and* gets new pipeline capacity to tidewater. Construction restarts this summer.
1308 2018-06-16 20:27:57 The growth report is based on the worst case scenario with no oil revenues factored in. We’ll be fine!
1309 2018-06-16 20:27:50 Makes sense. Given it’s a sell-out country. Where dirty oil and corruption reign supreme. Putin’s 2nd favorite team.
1310 2018-06-16 20:27:37 Note: I support your right to condemn new oil exploration but encourage you to see that opposing it in non-democratic countries would be of greater good.
1311 2018-06-16 20:27:32 For years I’ve been going to Jiffy Lube for an oil change with a blade-less windshield wiper, and every time they say my wipers are fine but I need a new air filter. #tricks #lies #gas #oil #carstuff
1312 2018-06-16 20:27:22 That are NOT deadly. I was put on a dose of narcotics that would kill most. Not knowing how dangerous and deadly they were. Now I can take a harmless oil, with NO thc to get me high, that helps my pain more than any deadly narcotics.  So please
1313 2018-06-16 20:26:54 moses and oil price who sabi fall pass?
1314 2018-06-16 20:26:48 That’s what I was getting at - the organisations benefit themselves, not the public at large. It’s been proven time and again. We are seeing it writ large in areas such as traditional oil production and fracking. Capitalism does what benefits the wealthy and no one else.
1315 2018-06-16 20:26:46 STAY ON YOUR GADDEM FEET AND STOP FALLING LIKE OIL PRICES
1316 2018-06-16 20:26:36 Try cbd oil
1317 2018-06-16 20:26:28 Labour in Ayrshire voters dont know about "Oil on the Clyde", for that to happen it would have had to have been the name of a Player subbed on during a crucual Rangers and Celtic game , and only after scoring the winner.

Then you see the value of press and BBC.
1318 2018-06-16 20:26:12 The other subtle thing is that since all large New England generators generally get paid at the kWh rate of the most expensive plant that happens to be running at the moment, natural gas plants are most profitable when someone is burning expensive oil.
1319 2018-06-16 20:26:11 Baby oil bikin muka alussss
1320 2018-06-16 20:26:07 Isn't it brilliant, they actually done the right thing.  This country needs to seriously have a rethink about legalising cannabis oil in this country
1321 2018-06-16 20:26:05 Yes but only for 20 days, and only given by the hospital. What happens after 20 days. Legalise as other children are needing this oil too.

1324 2018-06-16 20:25:49 Why not sooner..........palm oil is killing forests and animals for $€£
1325 2018-06-16 20:25:44 Instead of recognizing the danger Corp run Countries now like USA+Russia will see it as a business op to drill for oil in Arctic= WHICH SHOULD NEVER BE DONE
1326 2018-06-16 20:25:25 Ban palm oil.
1327 2018-06-16 20:25:20 It was the law for his mother to have it confiscated on entry. Border force had to follow the law.

 They had to change the law. Took them 2/3 days too long. But I guess you do have to ensure folks have some protection from DIY snake oil solutions.

Some of which are dangerous.

1329 2018-06-16 20:25:11 I have just seen a very rare creature today you have to look very hard and be very quiet and they do make an appearance.

Can you see it a home office minister that actually cares about a  fellow human being well done for letting them keep the cannabis oil
1330 2018-06-16 20:25:10 tried that! unfortunately i am so addicted to coconut oil that i’m like 99% sure my skin is like?? immune?? is that possible ??
1331 2018-06-16 20:25:05 Excellent evidence of Pruitt’s horrific complicity with oil/gas polluters. That man will have years in prison to consider if his corruption was ‘worth it!’

1334 2018-06-16 20:24:38 Don’t you start Satnav. I don’t understand how you can’t want Nigeria to win when they are the 12th largest producer of crude oil in the world.
1335 2018-06-16 20:24:37 ７月１０日はオイルの日。「７１０」を逆さにすると「ＯＩＬ」に見えるから
1336 2018-06-16 20:24:33 BC would have lost their challenge against the pipeline but Kinder Morgan couldn’t handle the delay. As the PM has said, Alberta needs the oil revenue now to fund the low carbon transition - think of what Norway has done with its oil revenue - highest EV use on Earth
1337 2018-06-16 20:24:30 @sajidjavid well done for allowing the use of cannabis oil for the12 yr old.
1338 2018-06-16 20:23:53 I don’t particularly care about oil shops but fancy vinegar shops that work the same way are 
1339 2018-06-16 20:23:49 I’ve been off since Tuesday  i was waiting for my car to get an oil change the other day and accidentally spent $75 on baby clothes for my niece on Etsy  i need to go back
1340 2018-06-16 20:23:31 I can’t draw slush pone the same way I drew dub biz because I was coloring dubbix with my friend’s oil pastels.
1341 2018-06-16 20:23:25 You can total your car by not changing the oil so pls do it
1342 2018-06-16 20:22:36 Coconut oil??
1343 2018-06-16 20:22:33 Dr. Tishler, are you familiar with the Prime My Body hemp oil? It’s advertised as a “nano-enhanced” CBD/hemp oil for topical/ sublingual administration. Are those ROI, BS for hemp as well or only marijuana?

1349 2018-06-16 20:21:30 there was a time in my life where instead of tanning oil i would use olive oil because my mom used to do it
1350 2018-06-16 20:21:04 #BackInTheDayWe knew how to change the oil, change a tire and only pussies called AAA. And another thing
1351 2018-06-16 20:20:59 Victor Moses has fallen more times than the walls of jericho. The way this dude is going down, he'll soon discover crude oil in that stadium.
1352 2018-06-16 20:20:49 “A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius; but do not damage the oil and the wine.”
1353 2018-06-16 20:20:44 That guy is falling down like the price of oil - too much.
1354 2018-06-16 20:20:42 So many arguments focus on one pollution at a time.. Like synthesised oil, yeah great for co2, but still toxic emissions, at kerbside..
1355 2018-06-16 20:20:31 Every time I see palm oil listed I put it back! It's not necessary; I don't know why it's in so much.
1356 2018-06-16 20:20:15 Had my 1st ever instant oil change at @Valvoline today..  The techs were so courteous, efficient, and friendly!  Under 15 mins & never left my vehicle!  Great job.
1357 2018-06-16 20:20:00 He even called DNR and they said that we need to put soybean oil onto the eggs (they will lay next year's eggs, THIS YEAR), To prevent an outbreak even worse next year.  On weeds we use a mix of vinegar, salt and Dawn.  I sprayed the ones on her house, I hope it kills them.
1358 2018-06-16 20:19:49 Yeye Moses Dey fall like say him dey find oil for ground. Musa go sambisa forest go sell cow abi wetin. Bring him on to change the damn game coach

1361 2018-06-16 20:19:00 If your skin becomes extra oily in summer, there are foundations that help absorb excess sebum. Clinique's Beyond Perfecting Foundation does just this. Pair it with some oil blotting papers and you'll feel more comfortable. #protip
1362 2018-06-16 20:18:58 <みなさんにとっての"オイル"とは何ですか⁇
1363 2018-06-16 20:18:36 you can’t change ur own oil??
1364 2018-06-16 20:18:20 Yes because you are the one that we believe would stand up to all the people that have been lining their pockets line breaking the laws starting Wars that didn't need to happen other than to make more money for the oil people or gain more oil Land and not for any other reason
1365 2018-06-16 20:18:03 All of sudden everyone supporting Trudeau. How many trade deals has he secured? TPP not ratified kicked out of China made ass of himself in India so they want nothing to do with us Energy sector oil and gas heading to USA. No new Investment coming. He does not deserve our support
1366 2018-06-16 20:17:50 You must adjust threatened sea turtles but reach out to activists to diversify Pacific oil reserves. Make it happen!
1367 2018-06-16 20:17:45 Sephora is the most amazing place to work if you’re going out after? Literally filling a bin and fixing all of my makeup here and applying yummy perfume and this glow body oil. Wow.

1370 2018-06-16 20:17:24 Obviously the big pharmaceutical companies are going to strongly oppose any type of plant treatment, but the benefits of cannabis oil cannot be disputed.
1371 2018-06-16 20:17:12 No kidding, time to ban oil! 
That's what you were going to say, right?
Oh, you're a oil lobby group? Hmm..

Reaching pretty far there with this guys, how sad.
1372 2018-06-16 20:16:48 Just an oil change! :) preemptive care
1373 2018-06-16 20:16:37 What wrong with us Africans not evil politicians, foreign corporates and Nija is that country which import refined oil from EU ? #Nigeria
1374 2018-06-16 20:16:35 The sky might be falling, trump is going after steel and aluminum, getting ready to impose tariffs on the auto sector and dairy. Oil carried us through the last recession do you really want it to go away?

1376 2018-06-16 20:16:07 I think I’ve broken more oil pans than all my friends put together
1377 2018-06-16 20:15:59 if it is right to give approval today, and it is, it was also right to allow the child his medicine last week. The poor kid should.not have been made to suffer.  What about other ppl who would.benefit?

1410 2018-06-16 20:10:22 I’ll let you know. The medipen has been really well reviewed, seems super easy to use and comes with really high quality oil.
1411 2018-06-16 20:10:19 Jewish people follow the Jewish faith that has been alive for centuries. Zionizm is a term coined in late 1800s when Europeans discovered oil in ME. Zion is the biblical name of Jerusalem the central hub of their oil empire. Two TOTALLY different things.
1412 2018-06-16 20:10:07 15 Reasons I vote Democrat, eg

but a 15% govt TAX isn't.

1418 2018-06-16 20:09:42 I have oil for stretch marks, ‘cause why not try to get rid ain’t it?  Body butter, Nivea clear oil, Olay face cream & psoriasis creams as well - for them awkward flare ups ya don’t ever need but have

1421 2018-06-16 20:09:24 Now that the government is handing out cannabis oil I  wonder how many jakeys have their fingers crossed for Special Brew & buckie.

1424 2018-06-16 20:09:09 …During that the same time, #Reagan & #GHWBush backed #Saddam’s #Iraqi army against #Iran. As @POTUS41, #DaddyBush lost control of #Saddam, when #Iraq invaded #Kuwait. We set up bases in #SaudiArabia to prevent the #Iraqi Dicktator from controlling 2/3rds of the world’s oil…
1425 2018-06-16 20:09:08 It absorbs excess oil in your hair, which helps it look fresher and not greasy. It usually only takes a few seconds to spray or shake (if you get a powder kind) and you kind of ruffle it into your hair

"Don't forget to change the oil."
1429 2018-06-16 20:08:52 Soybeans ?? Texas has a shit ton of oil and we got customers for that!

1433 2018-06-16 20:07:48 i put argan oil on my face and then went to the pool and didn’t realize I literally was inviting the sun to burn my face off.
1434 2018-06-16 20:07:43 Tires rotated. Oil changed. Filters checked. Windshield wipers brand new. I feel like such an adult! Thanks @Valvoline :)
1435 2018-06-16 20:07:21 A thicker oil?
1436 2018-06-16 20:07:19 This is BULL!  Now every customer its mother will try to somehow use the sanctions to not pay Iran for the oil they have bought.  No money, no oil.  Iran should get paid first before delivery IMHO.
1437 2018-06-16 20:07:14 Oil couldn't stand on it's own legs without similar subsidies...
1438 2018-06-16 20:06:55 as cool as caliva is, select oil is very impressive
1439 2018-06-16 20:06:50 The last time the economy stopped growing I was unemployed for a year. Green Party has promised to make me unemployed since I work oil and gas nuclear

Why on earth would anyone vote green it's just a ticket to unemployment and cancelled holidays.

1451 2018-06-16 20:05:10 If you’re not totally satisfied with today’s weather please enjoy dipping yourself in some boiling oil all summer.
1452 2018-06-16 20:04:49 I work for a very large company in the oil and gas industry and we have actually cut back on jobs. No layoffs but when someone leaves we aren't replacing the position. Explain how that Corp tax cut is going to help?
1453 2018-06-16 20:04:42 Person to start a prayer session it can be for 7days using Oil 'Cooking Oil is still fine no need to call it anointing oil.
Now here we can't trust on human understating, This is beyond us.

1454 2018-06-16 20:04:41 So imagine the pizza dough with the chilli oil already infused into it - that’s what I had earlier. Fab.
1455 2018-06-16 20:04:37 I got my mom’s oil changed today and it took over 3hrs. I wish I could call my dog and tell her I’ll be home soon.
1456 2018-06-16 20:04:29 More than two times in my life I’ve forgotten a dirty martini had olive juice and couldn’t figure out why anyone would put olive oil in a cocktail.
1457 2018-06-16 20:04:26 . Btw ile oil ulipewa ama bado
1458 2018-06-16 20:04:23 That's the smoke they leave behind, the gas they produce, hence the residue that turns into oil.
1459 2018-06-16 20:04:08 Oil is primarily a transportation fuel. Wind and solar generate electricity. 

Fossil fuels like natural gas help wind and solar grow by providing reliable electricity.
1460 2018-06-16 20:03:44 Finally got an oil change  
1461 2018-06-16 20:03:42 It should be made legal for everyone who needs this drug.
So glad Billy was able to be prescribed the cannabis oil.
1462 2018-06-16 20:03:41 I actually worked in London in the 1980's and the sky line was shite since then, it's turned into one of the best in the world. Now! the price of oil going back up. Jings!! guess what Westmonster announces proudly we're building a new runway at Heathrow airport. You figure

1465 2018-06-16 20:02:46 The reason there is black oil, because of the fall, because the tissue residue is transformed into black oil.

1469 2018-06-16 20:01:58 I was under the impression that the oil was CBD and didn’t contain THC. THC is the ‘high’.
1470 2018-06-16 20:01:22 I need $100billion dollars to install 4crude oil plant here in Nigeria .
1471 2018-06-16 20:01:16 Many Canadians are saying "Buy Chinese not American" Vacation in Mexico not USA. Sell our oil to  china not USA....and piss in the Columbia river! lol
1472 2018-06-16 20:01:12 Do you know how government works you complete and total evil man? If anyone wondered if you sold snake oil, now they know. You defend @realDonaldTrump over innocent children @Franklin_Graham 
You're an abomination
1473 2018-06-16 20:00:58 @realDonaldTrump Canada must charge market price for their oil and not the low price wanted by the Texas cosortium. Market cost must be paid

1478 2018-06-16 20:00:37 The cannabis oil, which contains a substance called Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), is illegal in the UK but available elsewhere. The CBD oils which you can even buy from Holland and barrett doesn’t have the THC and is legal to use in the U.K.
1479 2018-06-16 20:00:35 IEA: Venezuela and Iran could leave supply deficit. 

The IEA said in its latest Oil Market Report that robust U.S. shale growth will underpin 2.0 million barrels per day (mb/d) of non-OPEC supply growth this year, plus 1.7 mb/d of non-OPEC output gains in 2019.
1480 2018-06-16 20:00:32 we actually elect these cretins!! it beggars belief! even today there is a lad suffering in hospital being denied cannabis oil to ease his ill health because of elected beaurocrats! about time for a ministry of common sense!

1484 2018-06-16 19:59:45 Oil prices bounced around over the past few days as the markets await OPEC’s decision in a week’s time. While the meeting is shaping up to be a contentious one, the hype also demonstrates OPEC’s clout years after the group’s obituary was written.

1490 2018-06-16 19:59:28 Had my alternator replaced last week, got an oil change today, and now I find out one of my tires is balding 
1491 2018-06-16 19:59:15 Goggle who sits on it now and chairs it. 
It's a joke
1492 2018-06-16 19:58:57 Hey - don't go yet...  You never told me whether or not you work for the government.

Hell - I'll go first. I am an electrical - now software - engineer, and may check comes directly from oil and chemical companies.  Confession - Years ago I did work for the govt for 18 months.
1493 2018-06-16 19:58:49 IIRC, ISO New England probably has published a report talking about how sometimes getting oil deliveries to the existing plants has been a bit of a challenge in extreme cold (although I think thus far hasn't quite turned into a huge problem).
1494 2018-06-16 19:58:23 It is good to carry out background research as to why to government opted to shut down the oil refinery on changamwe be4 commenting.  But generally oil business has cartels all over the world
1495 2018-06-16 19:58:19 Magwinya a batla enough sugar and oil, some people limit those ingredients and in return they lose their yummy taste. A nna tasteless.

1497 2018-06-16 19:57:52 Oil and gas employees are mostly engineers and engineering is based on applied science! What a stupid dimwit comment!

1500 2018-06-16 19:57:18 I  believe you to be a sensible person who can understand the benefits using Canadas oil revenue to finance post oil adoptions.  
Why should Canada give the economic benefits to other countries with poorer environmental and human rights records?

1504 2018-06-16 19:56:49 lo tengo claro, pero a menos que pueda conseguir otro gas oil para poner un tanque alternativo y conectar antes de apagar, otro remedio es tener un by pass en el filtro para que arranque. La otra es esperar que se funda Ancap y empiecen a importar, pero no lo veo.
1505 2018-06-16 19:56:44 Apricot juice, lemon berbana tea, castor oil & almond butter LMAO it doesn’t taste well at all but it’s been know to put women into labor within a few hours of drinking it
1506 2018-06-16 19:56:38 Lemon, rosemary, or lavender infused witch hazel. Use a light oil like almond or vitamin E oil after. Give your skin time to adjust so start with one or if your skin is oily combo keep some with you in a mini bottle and refresh your face throughout the day.

1510 2018-06-16 19:55:45 Socialism has its place if it helps promote honesty and integrity with some types of situations where some folks will try to sell you anything just to get richer. It can be a useful stop gap prevention measure against snake oil salesmen.
1511 2018-06-16 19:55:25 It does, but I would guess that we have an established oil distribution infrastructure which provides a viable alternative in the case of a natural gas supply interruption.

1515 2018-06-16 19:54:41 I’ve just read about freezing fresh herbs in ice cube trays but using oil instead of water. It preserves them to use in cooking. Might try both...
1516 2018-06-16 19:54:38 I think there are a few have not provinces that benefit a whole lot from Alberta oil.
1517 2018-06-16 19:54:23 This is saving lives all over the country and not just adults.CBD oil does NOT get you high,infact has MANY health benefits.Saving children with seizure disorders all over.I guess you think big pharma will save us? how many times have yp2u heard of alcohol

There is no way that a few 'professionals' can determine how some plant oil will interact with the little boy's biochemistry without testing it with him

It is apparent that his mother has already done this whilst working with doctors

The side effect risks are extremely low
1526 2018-06-16 19:53:10 Really? You had to bring the issue of oil?  Anyway, i love the industry and maybe one day Kenya will be at the World Cup
1527 2018-06-16 19:53:09 Maybe you're right, I just feel uncomfortable with offering false hope of cures or the equivalent of snake oil. 
I support #cannabis #legalization 100% but we mustn't lose sight of truth in advertising health claims

1541 2018-06-16 19:50:09 If someone is promising moar and faster supply, I think that is pretty much snake oil. But I can see the principle of meaningfully adding density in "nice" areas being a populist vote winner, if not equally snake-oily for advancing affordability

1558 2018-06-16 19:47:51 I don't think I'd describe people with access to cannabis oil as 'dodgy people'. They're much more numerous than you think, and with nothing but good intentions most of the time.
1559 2018-06-16 19:47:43 CBD oil also works for some without THC but I fully accept I got this specific case wrong.
1560 2018-06-16 19:47:08 Interesting. Quick question, do you work for Big Oil? Because I didn’t get my check this week and I’m starting to think it got burned in the short squeeze of the century. $TSLA $TSLAQ

1566 2018-06-16 19:45:52 Change the oil in yo car don’t try to change me
1567 2018-06-16 19:45:40 Dog, I need an oil change, fill up, and car wash. Where do I think I’m going?
1568 2018-06-16 19:45:34 The speed with which solar and wind will crush oil and coal is underrated. We are already close if not at a tipping point, with many technological efficiencies still in development which will drive renewable costs lower still. Then the value of oil reserves collapses.
1569 2018-06-16 19:45:29 Higher farmgate prices result I higher consumer prices. Unless you expect processors to sell at a loss.

Great idea. We should supply manage the oil industry too. Pay rig workers 60% more than than the rest of the world. They shouldn't be exposed to the realities of scarcity.
1570 2018-06-16 19:45:19 Me! I love applying lotion or oil to her beautiful feet :) yours would be a pleasure to work on

1573 2018-06-16 19:45:03 Does jet airplane fuel and/or fuel oil have better energy density than methane?  There's got to be some reason that many newer New England natural gas plants have the option of running on fuel oil instead of just using natural gas from an on site tank, right?
1574 2018-06-16 19:44:51 Good. Socialist policies aren't responsible for Venezuela's plight. They were too dependant on the price of oil, role of oligarchs, etc. Socialist policies lifted people out of poverty.

1580 2018-06-16 19:43:14 This thread is literally one Brit vs America. He’s making constructive, informed and well thought out suggestions. You may have more guns, tanks, oil and money but collective intellect appears to be lacking, or indeed, absent. America: The Parody.
1581 2018-06-16 19:43:04 Boo why’d I schedule an oil change during a community event.  This area is dead :(
1582 2018-06-16 19:42:59 Jus got my oil change and tires rotated. Now i am happy thats over
1583 2018-06-16 19:42:57 That's exactly what the carbon tax is targeting - the actual burning of fossil fuels. The carbon tax doesn't apply when exporting fossil fuels. I would argue you have it exactly backward: the Liberals are fighting hard to get a better price for Alberta oil, so TMX has to happen.

1604 2018-06-16 19:39:55 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
1605 2018-06-16 19:39:39 A naturally occurring plant that we share this planet with.

There are clearly unpublished reasons why the oil was confiscated. They are the complexity.
1606 2018-06-16 19:39:25 Just took a shot of olive oil. Easiest $15 I’ve ever made
1607 2018-06-16 19:38:59 I had that dream again.
You'd made a pit out of pillows and a tarp.
Filled it with snacks.
A fantasy you explain,
not yet a fetish.
You thrill to the crunch of chips on plastic,
oil on skin,
spices on lips
and revel in the sting of salt in scores of scratches,

1611 2018-06-16 19:38:29 lesson of the day: never confuse transmission fluid and motor oil bc then you’ll have twice as much oil as you need and your vehicle won’t run:^)
1612 2018-06-16 19:38:28 I asked Sarah if I should get tanning oil and she said “ are you gonna sit outside and play the sims?”
1613 2018-06-16 19:38:27 Go Trump!   The energy department was created in the very early 1970's. It's who purpose was to end America's dependence on foreign oil. 45 plus years later it is now a huge government entity and we are still dependant on foreign oil.  Pump American and buy American.

1619 2018-06-16 19:37:06 I’ve fake tanned for 12 years. I thought there was nothing I didn’t know. But then I just had a baby oil infused shower and exfoliated all my tan off. Didn’t even know this was possible
1620 2018-06-16 19:37:02 YAH!!! GOGO!! ADD OIL!
1621 2018-06-16 19:36:51 They sell macadamia oil for your hair! It’s great and COCONUT OIL! Amazing! You could also do olive oil and honey!

1626 2018-06-16 19:36:06 You might consider me a “shade tree mechanic” because I can change the oil, rotate the tires, or make minor repairs on any domestic or foreign shade tree
1627 2018-06-16 19:35:50 My skin is always so smooth in the summer from all that baby oil I use to tan
1628 2018-06-16 19:35:31 Fried foods generally will exhaust your body's enzymes. Moreover, oxidation occurs extremely quickly in foods cooked in oil. I cook with water! No, not like a regular rice steamer must more advanced than that!Like Bruce Lee once said,"Be like the Nature of Water!"Bruce was right.

Now lets talk oil on the Clyde , prevented in order to keep Trident berthed in Scotland , at the behest of the MOD.
1634 2018-06-16 19:35:09 I am worried about mine, not because oil won't have an important role in near future, but because Venezuela won't likely be a major oil exporter soon
1635 2018-06-16 19:35:09 Oil pulled for the first time this morning; oooof that was rough not gonna lie.
1636 2018-06-16 19:34:55 Bigger propaganda push, more money spent. Yes big oil. A lot.

1641 2018-06-16 19:34:21 WELL WELL WELL appearing on Radio Scotland’s ‘Newsweek’ show when he undermined much of what Unionist politicians and Scottish media commentators have been saying about Scotland for years.  Norway is a smaller oil producer that Scotland with harsher
1642 2018-06-16 19:34:07 Too bad their zeal is misplaced. The people mean well but have been sold “Snake Oil”.
1643 2018-06-16 19:33:57 I assume promoted #tweets cost money like any advertising. If so #LuisVuitton are wasting serious money trying to sell their perfume for men, to someone who will on occasion comb some patchouli oil through his beard.
1644 2018-06-16 19:33:49 Wait what WTF you're 43 ?? Do you bathe in oil of olay ??
1645 2018-06-16 19:33:48 Me eating healthy just means I’m eating a shit ton of fruits and spinach/green beans now and i cook with olive oil instead of butter and my water intake is up. But I feel great and my skin is even better so that’s primo
1646 2018-06-16 19:33:42 Obviously the @DNC voices are weak whispers! No one hears or knows what the Hell-0 Dems are doing! The squeaky wheel gets the most oil! Seems everything Trump/Giuliani says is blared across MSM while Dems hide in the shadows afraid! Dems need to fight back forcefully & Loudly!
1647 2018-06-16 19:33:42 Well, the Kinder Morgan pipeline would probably be done by now if Trump became our prime minister when Justin started. This would bolster homegrown industry and significantly reduce the oil differential we have on oil sales to the US. But I guess that still doesnt work with left?

1651 2018-06-16 19:33:28 I'll be honest, I just scanned through this video. Shale oil is short term play. Right now it's big in the Permian Basin. Lot of Alberta oil folks are down there right now.
But, it does not last. It's a get in and get out quick investment. #Oilsand in #Alberta is bigger long term
1652 2018-06-16 19:33:07 Norway's Sovereign Wealth fund, created on the back of oil to pay for future pensions , was only set up in the 90s. Westminster has been tapping, in the Scottish sense, SNSO since 79 - and "begrudgingly" gifting back a geographical share of sub 9% of its rightful 100%.

1654 2018-06-16 19:32:59 Really? Wow, I used to have oil in my old house and we filled the tank every two months at a cost of 1500-1800 each fill. MA is bloody expensive and freakin' cold!
1655 2018-06-16 19:32:53 Shut down that oil pipeline.
1656 2018-06-16 19:32:51 My father in law passed 6 months (to the day) after my grandfather. The same with him, they changed his chemo and he passed. He wouldn't take the CBD oil, he was old school and refused to take it, even though we bought him a monthly supply. He was just stuck in his ways. :(
1657 2018-06-16 19:32:44 Yah, I’m sure they are! Usually you can just oven fir a little less oil burns though 
1658 2018-06-16 19:32:39 They give hints to his workplace and what he does for a living throughout games. He owns an Oil company, so you know he's rich.
1659 2018-06-16 19:32:18 Blockades. Strikes. Small, non violent actions with big consequences.
Just one example: stop the helicopters flying personnel to the oil platforms and have them shut down.
I guarantee that, in a week, the penny drops.

1663 2018-06-16 19:31:40 That will eff up the oil market. Want to hear the rationale for this increase.

1666 2018-06-16 19:31:14 And Big Oil

1668 2018-06-16 19:30:42 Not really. I am sure there are better ways, but lately since I have a fancy Black and Decker steamer, I cut some of the top off and set them upside down on the steam part and set the timer. Voila.  I have heard that others boil them using a wee bit of olive oil. Need to try it.
1669 2018-06-16 19:30:41 Chamberlain was, in the very least, doing what he thought was best for Britain at the time.

1674 2018-06-16 19:30:18 I think it’s about time to re-enact the French Revolution and oil up the guillotines. Tar, feathers and a rail is far too easy on these scofflaw scum.

Motherfucker, Olive Oil was a thing in the Mediterenean.

1684 2018-06-16 19:28:19 Health effects remain unclear from ingesting plastic

I’m gonna say humans & animals ingesting plastic is deadly

1703 2018-06-16 19:24:19 The entire upper echelon of the FBI needs to be PURGED, including that shifty eyed snake oil salesman Christopher Wray
1704 2018-06-16 19:24:09 Man this dealership is feeding me lunch and washing my car? All I needed was an oil change.
1705 2018-06-16 19:24:07 SGER doesn't seem to have had a huge negative impact on Oil and Gas investment... and BC's investment climate seems to be doing as well as any other Canadian province.
1706 2018-06-16 19:24:07 'Signs for Lost Children' by Sarah Moss. 'Stockport, the brick viaduct slashing the valley like oil paint thrown on a watercolour.'
1707 2018-06-16 19:23:27 Lebron and Boogie dont mix. They are both very ball dominant and will mix like oil and water.
1708 2018-06-16 19:23:24 Nope, not buying it. You're still a machine and that is a glass of oil disguised as a cocktail 
1709 2018-06-16 19:23:20 The non wall folks can get back with me in a yr or 2 after a new president of Mexico,  far to the left of Vincente Fox gets a chance to work his magic. They don't know
1710 2018-06-16 19:23:18 Nvm then i mean u can use some oil anyway but djdksk id use the oven tbh
1711 2018-06-16 19:23:13 2 tbl spoons Turmeric with 2 tablespoon of .magnolia oil from Pep and try to get the aloe plant
1712 2018-06-16 19:23:12 -Volatile trading made worse by lack of regulations/oversight.
-Oil crisis in the 70's causing market crashes due to lack of regulation/oversight.
-Great Recession: volatile trading in subprime loans, made worse by lack of regulations/oversight.
I'm sensing a pattern here
1713 2018-06-16 19:23:09 They already are going into national parks to pump oil. They won’t think twice about taking what land they left Native Americans if they think it will put 2 cents in their pockets.
1714 2018-06-16 19:23:08 call me olive oil cause i’m extra virgin
1715 2018-06-16 19:23:01 Haha came in for a oil change left weed in my front seat I’m dead
1716 2018-06-16 19:22:50 I did some grocery shopping, fed Monkey lunch, gave him some CBD oil, and now I'm off to play video games before making dinner because screw cleaning the kitchen right now.
1717 2018-06-16 19:22:50 ^THIS.  Max your 401k first then spend the rest however you like.
1718 2018-06-16 19:22:40 You mean he brought our sons and daughters home from war to end the drug/oil war?
1719 2018-06-16 19:22:20 My parents got some secret oil money somewhere.
1720 2018-06-16 19:22:20 Ya binty e7na fi masr ain't no essential oil gonna do shit. Also you're not supposed to put it directly on skin!

Got a good night's rest
Prayed
Listened to music

Drank water
Took supplements
Drank tea

Pray some more
Mediate
And have a nice day:)

1722 2018-06-16 19:22:05 I love being at the beach and lathering myself with tanning oil and feeling greasy
1723 2018-06-16 19:22:03 Very irresponsible headline.. it feeds protesters' hysteria.. 10ml???? The story here is excellent awareness and reporting by KM. I'm sure the protester's old RV leaks more than 10 ml of oil on a daily basis.. with no reporting or awareness.  Ditto for their diesel generator.
1724 2018-06-16 19:22:01 Electric heat around here is the most expensive, but there's no gas in my area and oil is disgusting.
1725 2018-06-16 19:21:53 Uhm,if you buy swiffer 72 dust wipes at 6,90 they give you a very pretty oil container
1726 2018-06-16 19:21:39 Wouldn’t worry. Lots use base acrylic & oil on top or mixed media. If it’s a beautiful piece it’s a beautiful piece. I have no doubt it will be a beautiful painting regardless 
1727 2018-06-16 19:21:34 This is probably a dumb question but those of you who use CBD oil. Can you just order it off the internet or where do you get it?
1728 2018-06-16 19:21:26 @JustinTrudeau Aren't you an ungrateful bastard, since that pipeline that President Trump authorized to pump your oil to the gulf benefits you and all Canadians, while we get to clean up the Dirty Work or relative to a possible oil spill?
1729 2018-06-16 19:20:51 Why is it that when you're on call you can go weeks without problems... Then the day you finally decide to do your oil change and brake job you get multiple calls when you're covered in oil and dirt....
1730 2018-06-16 19:20:49 Hope all these players put anointing oil on their heads before the game  #CRONIG
1731 2018-06-16 19:20:41 Saudi Arabia should flex their oil muscles in football. They have always lost by more that 5 goals since I started watching the World cup!
1732 2018-06-16 19:20:06 I use coffee and olive oil
1733 2018-06-16 19:20:03 Oil
1734 2018-06-16 19:19:59 When I get home from work, I’m drowning my hair in coconut oil and I’m going tf to sleep
1735 2018-06-16 19:19:39 Remember the trade tariffs hadn’t done its damage yet , creating job loss & inflation in the cost of living ; along with the world oil scam this could create a world depression!?!
1736 2018-06-16 19:19:38 Someone should turn old oil paintings into iSpy games... 
1737 2018-06-16 19:19:38 Why arnt all sufferers of this and other diseases being treated with cannabis oil if by granting a license you are acknowledging that it works??
1738 2018-06-16 19:19:29 Iced tiramisu fudge (used to be Black and Tan but I graduated to this one) and then depending on my mood I’ll get either a rosemary and olive oil bagel w/ sausage egg and cheese or a pumpkin chocolate chip muffin
1739 2018-06-16 19:19:28 The proven oil reserves in Venezuela are recognized as the largest in the world, totaling 297 billion barrels (4.72×1010 m3) as of 1 January 2014. ... OPEC said that Saudi Arabia's reserves stood at 265 billion barrels (4.21×1010 m3) in 2009.

I think they need democracy.
1740 2018-06-16 19:19:11 Keep up the good work! I have an mining/oil & gas app I’m looking at putting on #DGB
1741 2018-06-16 19:18:58 ああオイル、どうして君はオイルなんだ…
1742 2018-06-16 19:18:58 Whisky cheap oil and sheep won't sustain the economy. 

As for fishing the EU take more fish than Scotland are ever allowed to catch
1743 2018-06-16 19:18:57 She attempted to “openly smuggle” drugs. The cannabis oil in question is illegal in the uk there is no paperwork for it! She also said she’d fly back Canada to bring more back. I’m aware of the role of the home office thanks. Rules are rules unless it suits
1744 2018-06-16 19:18:53 nope nutella uses sustainable palm oil
1745 2018-06-16 19:18:45 All kiling Muslims for under graund oil and minerals.
1746 2018-06-16 19:18:43 ooo olive oil works so much better than regular tanning oil 
1747 2018-06-16 19:18:40 Lamp oil, rope, bombs? You want it? It's yours, my friend, as long as you have enough rubies.
1748 2018-06-16 19:18:38 do i buy groceries or a new oil pan and gasket for debbie? lmao
1749 2018-06-16 19:18:34 I just made myself a sugar scrub with licorice tea and coconut oil, and it's been amazing! 

Where are you blogging this stuff?
1750 2018-06-16 19:18:27 Me too. It is shocking. At least now, as I understand it, it does have to be labelled and not hidden as enteric veg oil. Tough if you’re vegan, as many friends are - loads of vegan specific products contain it, which is plain unnecessary and ridiculous!
1751 2018-06-16 19:18:22 Wonder if she is struggling to get the oil here in the UK. Need some advice?
1752 2018-06-16 19:18:17 (estara d buen humor?? Habra bajado la cotizacion dl oil?? Se habra dado una panzada d pastelitos d membrisho con 23 litros d mate? tanta risa d la nada es sospechosa... O yo estare pensando muy alto?)
1753 2018-06-16 19:18:10 Photos: Billionaire Business man, oil magnate and President of FC Ifeanyi Ubah, Dr. Patrick Ifeanyi Ubah live at Kaliningrad Russia to cheer up the Nigerian Super Eagles in their ongoing match against Croatia
1754 2018-06-16 19:18:02 This is all really nice! I use a cleansing balm instead of a liquid oil cleanser since I wear heavy eye makeup, but my routine is really similar. Isn’t have your skin feel right for the first time ever the best?? I’ve been on this about a year and I have been SO happy with it.
1755 2018-06-16 19:16:55 fr!! it’ll make my makeup look glowy and nice for sure which is nice at the beginning of the day but I also have oily skin so it seems like it just speeds up the process of my oil showing through
1756 2018-06-16 19:16:53 I think it could be egg related. She isn't very hungry but I'll try adding oil to corn, thank you :)
1757 2018-06-16 19:16:18 I have been seeing this for months.  Then people argue with me.  Companies closing & equipment leaving.  A huge oil related company is have a liquidation sale this weekend.  70 vac trucks, 20 mechanic trucks, furniture etc.  They are done.
1758 2018-06-16 19:16:11 or like sanaflower seed oil
1759 2018-06-16 19:15:53  I'm drinking chamomile tea and I've rubbed calming and happiness essential oil all over my body. I shall not die but live to declare the goodness of God.
1760 2018-06-16 19:15:46 Stir together 1/3 cup yogurt with 4 1/2 tbsps grapes. Add Olive Oil. Drain. Serve over basmati rice.
1761 2018-06-16 19:15:44 I highly recommend rubbing baby powder over the area you plan on waxing beforehand, and becoming knowledgeable on which type of wax to use (hard/soft) for the desired area. Also, oil (baby, grapeseed, etc.) and cool compresses after are your best friends. Hope this helps next
1762 2018-06-16 19:15:25 変態王のまちがいじゃ…
1763 2018-06-16 19:15:23 Check your Transmission oil this Sunday.
1764 2018-06-16 19:15:13 And if you think that brahmins don't do discrimination or for that matter any upper caste doesn't do then you are naive mam. In my home town alone I have seen this trait more than often. Maybe not oil pouring but yeah subtle discrimination are enough.
1765 2018-06-16 19:15:05 At the mechanic for a basic oil change. They keep saying that I need all these different things that would be hundreds of dollars.
1766 2018-06-16 19:14:56 Stop killing each other. Kick oil CO. out. Grow weed.
1767 2018-06-16 19:14:35 I was shocked to see the variety of products containing palm oil, I try to opt for alternatives as much as possible.
1768 2018-06-16 19:14:30 Yeah! Not alone though— I like it with avocado, cream cheese, oil/vinegar. Big radish fans will recommend just butter and salt.
1769 2018-06-16 19:13:40 Not defending gurus,but you must not remember a few years back oil was at 27 dollars per barrel
1770 2018-06-16 19:13:39 Well the thing is they have parents but were taken from them.  US don’t want people coming into their country but invade other countries for oil.   The fact you see nothing wrong here is ridiculous man.  What kind of asshole puts a giant mural of himself in a place like this?
1771 2018-06-16 19:13:37 Someone online just told me to believe something without providing any evidence. SURE. 

I'll buy all the snake oil you have, sir.

1773 2018-06-16 19:13:16 I always laugh when people post how overly accomplished they feel when they drop the kids off at daycare, go to the bank, get an oil change, mow the yard, make dinner, and clean the bathroom like those aren’t already things expected of a functional adult how DO YOU DO IT ALL ABBY
1774 2018-06-16 19:13:16 He’d probably like some high quality tanning oil  I always remember him sunbathing in center field
1775 2018-06-16 19:13:13 just seen the egg post. there could be some stuck shell - has she been laying with weak shells? Would reiterate that getting some oil down her would be good (at least that's what's worked for mine)
1776 2018-06-16 19:12:47 Drive thru oil change is the only reason I dont mind going
1777 2018-06-16 19:12:28 Coconut oil is the new cocoa butter.
1778 2018-06-16 19:12:14 CANNABIS NO PROB but cannabis oil is not immediately obvious where to get it . Had it been my child I would have been on the next boat to Amsterdam
1779 2018-06-16 19:12:09 raw shea butter, sea kelp, & argan oil hair masque
1780 2018-06-16 19:12:02 Why?  Big Oil Lobbyists and...Harold Hamm, billionaire Oklahoma fracker who backed Pruitt in the OK AG race + recommended Scotty to Trump for EPA. And yes, Hamm gave $$$$ to Trump, too.
1781 2018-06-16 19:12:00 Just had cannabis oil, I’m gunna slump when this kicks in 
1782 2018-06-16 19:11:57 I’m starving , I need to get an oil change. Neifers taking 3 hours just to get his braids done ... likee 
1783 2018-06-16 19:11:40 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
1784 2018-06-16 19:11:30 It is the same crowd who are anti oil but keep all the luxeries it provides hypocrites
1785 2018-06-16 19:11:29 It's not just Billy unfortunately. There are thousands of us parents trying to get this oil for critically ill children. It's a shame the only way to get Home Office attention is to let Billy get so ill again
1786 2018-06-16 19:11:29 Do you even realize how many cars are driven each day? Or how many coal fired power plants exist? Or how many flights occur per day? Or how much oil/coal we consume? Or how many forests are burned via slash and burn? I could go on...
1787 2018-06-16 19:11:13 I couldn't stand mine because I did crochet. I was trying to take the short cut but I think next time, I'm gonna do it the long way. & I wish I would've thought about the oil!! 
1788 2018-06-16 19:10:57 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
1789 2018-06-16 19:10:16 Next Friday, OPEC & Russia will meet to decide how much & when they'll increase oil production. Russia & Saudi Arabia are also talking at the World Cup in Russia.
1790 2018-06-16 19:10:06 Endless oil story
1791 2018-06-16 19:10:00 Cleaning solution?  Pure sacrilege.
(soak in olive oil or mineral oil to help loosen encrusted debris...  But never ever ever use a cleaning solution if you want to maintain a coins value)
1792 2018-06-16 19:09:53 Guess what I'm talking abt. It's cooked with a mixture of sugar, honey, ghee, Amla, jam, sesame oil, berries and various herbs and spices. 

It's a 500 crore market.
1793 2018-06-16 19:09:45 So we lower our exports, use the materials for ourselves here. We've got more than enough resources in this country to be self sufficient and resources valuable enough (like oil & gold) that other countries will still want regardless, which should continue to generate wealth here
1794 2018-06-16 19:09:42 Operation Wetback was the response to Mexican demands to stop egress. Perhaps Mexico has been deprived when 20%+ of pop resides in U.S. Maybe contributes to lack of political economics progress.
1795 2018-06-16 19:09:23 There are so many of us parents wanting this oil for our children. Watching your own go blue and pumping them full of chemicals is criminal. Please @Schofe behind this #alfieneedsaprescription #MySonToo
1796 2018-06-16 19:09:22 Looking for a sponsor for next season for @HCIFC @THE66POW. I don’t need money, just cod liver oil, WD-40 and a tube of deep heat  #onemoreseason
1797 2018-06-16 19:09:21 I love mine though  someone told me to oil them so hopefully that works
1798 2018-06-16 19:09:14 Ok, so as a consumer we can make choices. But, sadly, many consumers are naive (incl me in many cases). Those making products containing palm oil, producing things in disposable plastic etc DO know the issues. They’re choosing profit over them. Irresponsible doesn’t cover it.
1799 2018-06-16 19:09:00 I worked on rigs back in the seventies what a nasty filthy deal that was. You want numbers the oil companies are really making out.
1800 2018-06-16 19:09:00 Somebody told me to oil them so hopefully that works because I really like them
1801 2018-06-16 19:08:48 Like I said pick up your drink and throw it away if you are done this grumpy butt decided to go change his oil cause he got annoyed 
1802 2018-06-16 19:08:43 Worked out. Oil changed. Car washed. Grocery shopping done. Baby shower up next 
1803 2018-06-16 19:08:30 Came to the dealership to get a oil change and they told me it was complimentary. Look at God being proud of me for adulting! #Blessed
1804 2018-06-16 19:08:28 Using a BIO Oil would eliminate this risk - made from plants - call me
1805 2018-06-16 19:08:27 should I also mention how bro puts those three Idk what it's called that has liquid and colorful oil(?) type liquid like hour glass on piano hah act humble good again hah really so conceited 'self confident' to think he's really so worthy 'privileged and protected' lawlz!!!!!!!!
1806 2018-06-16 19:08:24 I researched long and hard when my grandfather was sick, the thing I found was the CBD Oil. It was too late for my grandfather by the time I found this. But the research shows, that this is a great help, if legal in your state.
1807 2018-06-16 19:08:24 Oh heck aye! The oil cloth is in shades of grey and slate. The oven gloves are bright pink - good call! Now I'll have to get paint to match... In fact, a new kitchen would finish it off perfectly!
1808 2018-06-16 19:08:19 بنزين
Oil 
1809 2018-06-16 19:08:15 Bernie or buster lefties are ignorant people who fall for demagogues selling fast change and easy solution *snake oil* rather than face the realities of a slow moving very large democracy where progress is always going to be slow, imperfect and hard fought by its design/nature.
1810 2018-06-16 19:08:05 Plus, don't forget that America's ally in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia, intentionally dumped oil on the world market. Some suspect this was done specifically to target Venezuela and bring the government down.
1811 2018-06-16 19:08:04 Got to Sun Auto for my oil change and he comes in to say the car won't start. Good thing it died here 
1812 2018-06-16 19:07:56 @sajidjavid very sensible, the only way forward with the cbd oil for that poor boy. Why oh why are you lot so reluctant to use a plant with such amazing properties?? It’s time to move on this and get with nature, rather than relying with obsequiousness to the big pharma. Good man
1813 2018-06-16 19:07:40 Using Hyundai shuttle service while they do an oil change.  He said two hours and I was like do y’all have a shuttle? Lol
1814 2018-06-16 19:07:35 Nigeria and fluid football is like oil and water. We are just incapable of it. #Nigeria #WorldCup
1815 2018-06-16 19:07:30 In the UK, Nabilonem is an artificial version of THC (marijuana) and can be given to cancer patients to help relieve nausea during chemotherapy. Natural alternatives, such as marijuana oil, are disallowed as pharmaceutical companies are not allow to profit.

1817 2018-06-16 19:07:10 @iamjohnoliver Why didn't you show the night clubs in your propaganda. When did liberals start advocating toppling oil rich nations in favor of ExxonMobil & Shell?
1818 2018-06-16 19:07:07 My face is a oil factory yc wtr
1819 2018-06-16 19:07:06 OIL OF EVERY PEARL'S UN-INSIDES is the greatest album I've heard in a long time, and in a time nobody tries to make albums as a coherent idea anymore. SOPHIE saved the club jam for the 8th song and it was the perfect choice.
1820 2018-06-16 19:06:56 Just read the ingredients on the bottle of Ensure meal substitute: soy oil, canola oil, corn oil, sugar. How is this nutritious? This is supposed to help people too sick to eat get better??? Why are doctors recommending this? Rant over.
1821 2018-06-16 19:06:48 Ain’t nun slick to a can of oil
1822 2018-06-16 19:06:48 すいません
1823 2018-06-16 19:06:47 Actually Mexico recognized this as a brain/labor drain in 50's. Today these countries turn nonproductive citizens into paying ones with $0 overhead.
1824 2018-06-16 19:06:33 I had food poisoning before and what I did was put a few drops of basil oil in 4 cups of water to help with stomach pain and it kills the bacteria causing the poisoning! Hope you feel better soon! :)
1825 2018-06-16 19:06:32 You really don't have to peel the back. It has little or no effect at all. Just oil it up and make it as moist as you can and Moims will be just fine..
1826 2018-06-16 19:06:04 when you have to wait more than an hour on your oil change on your only day off. i hate being an adult.
1827 2018-06-16 19:06:03 It is the corporations... not just govt but companies that make profit from destruction of our natural world eg palm oil, sugar, water in plastic bottles. Dont BS with “offsetting” blah blah blah. Deal with the actual issues and encourage / allow people to make the right choices!
1828 2018-06-16 19:05:54 If you must talk "thousands" of our money , then we must talk decades of oil theft - while looking at Norways Soverign wealth fund of 1.1 billion dollars , only created in the 90s.

Then lets talk even more money with oil on the clyde.
1829 2018-06-16 19:05:44 So I wonder is mineral oil good for the hair then
1830 2018-06-16 19:05:41 We like oil and water it’d make for great tv and got 15 years of friendship in. @CBS come on

1837 2018-06-16 19:04:36 While using the medication overseas he was seizure free for 300 days so worth pursuing if he’s in a life threatening condition? Home Office have just overturned the ruling, allowing the hospital to use the oil to treat him.
1838 2018-06-16 19:04:33 I like how the vitamin E oil works
1839 2018-06-16 19:04:31 Getting my oil changed and they have golf on tv, because the only thing more boring than waiting for an oil change is golf on tv. ALSO, just HEARD someone crop dust me. So that's disgusting 
1840 2018-06-16 19:04:20 Bandaids won’t work. This is closer to an organ transplant. We didn’t get better lighting by optimizing oil lamp technology.
1841 2018-06-16 19:04:15 It's all shameless political crap. Dems were all for a wall, ending birthright citizenship and everify, before they weren't. Same with r's
1842 2018-06-16 19:04:12 Fresh, in season radishes are something special  You dont eat them with nothing else, usually with cream cheese, avocado, oil/vinegar, butter/salt
1843 2018-06-16 19:04:01 I think poverty not prosperity check Venezuela great  climate oil rich and people eating rat stew socialism is not what these morons say.
1844 2018-06-16 19:04:01 I don’t give trading advice. Without knowing the rest of your portfolio, risk tolerance, etc. To each their own...

Just know that shorting Tesla makes you very dumb, evil, on the payroll of Koch/big oil, etc.

Oh and you hate the planet too.

1850 2018-06-16 19:03:09 I can't speak for the rest of the country, but everyone I know down in the South is doing great. My wages went up, havent noticed any significant rise in costs to offset my tax savings, oil field hiring like crazy, jobs everywhere, small businesses owners I know are doing great.

1852 2018-06-16 19:02:29 Cannabis oil bad, but here's tramadol and morphine on prescription..

However the biggest thing is would this work for others and why isn't it allowed for medical.
1853 2018-06-16 19:02:26 Olive oil will do that, irrespective of temperature. But the fat should also do it.
1854 2018-06-16 19:02:05 1. Stress
2. Sulphates and parabens in shampoo
3. Try massaging your scalp with a nice non fragrant oil (coconut, almond, argan) 1 - 2 hrs before shower
4. Zinc supplements

1856 2018-06-16 19:01:51 Black soap and coconut oil is overrated. It’s like the first thing people suggest for skincare. Like come on. Be realistic. It doesn’t work that well and sometimes make situations worse.
1857 2018-06-16 19:01:41 Partygoer? Thought they were all starving to death. Sort of distorts your CIA /Big oil funded propaganda.

1867 2018-06-16 19:00:15 This is clearly one factor. It should also be noted that the Alta bounce  back looks strong in contrast to the #skpoli, but it isn’t all that great. Oil has just been slow to bounce back everywhere.
1868 2018-06-16 19:00:10 Try my mama's recipe with a poached egg: Parmesan, olive oil, lemon juice, cayenne, toast strips w/ a lot of butter for dipping in runny yolk. So good.

1880 2018-06-16 18:57:59 I finished college because of a state loan from the state of #Alaska where I lived for 33 years.
Alaska had the money to invest in its citizens because it taxed the oil companies for the oil  wealth they were extracting
That's what #socialism does for people!
1881 2018-06-16 18:57:56 Basically, all of the Ctax analysis on which our governments relies does not add up. It assumes that Canada's oil-producing regions will continue to produce oil for export long after our regulations massively impede domestic demand. It also assumes that taxes paid in the oil-...2

1890 2018-06-16 18:57:00 My Grandma's old remedy was to put your head under a towel over a bowl of hot water to steam your sinuses. You can add a tiny bit of eucalyptus oil but keep your eyes closed then. Lots of water. Lots of vitamin C.

1895 2018-06-16 18:56:10 Greed and humanity  like oil and water don’t mix.  Shameful   !!!
1896 2018-06-16 18:56:04 I hate getting oil changes
1897 2018-06-16 18:55:58 I’m extremely skeptical of health claims related to essential oils and herbal supplements and whatnot... but experience tells me that cypress oil works as well or better than anything else to clear up and heal “blemishes.”
1898 2018-06-16 18:55:54 I personally don’t agree. They had oil—just not enough. I believe apostasy is possible and prophesied.
1899 2018-06-16 18:55:44 I hear you guys have oil up there... just saying.

1908 2018-06-16 18:54:22 Billy Caldwell having his cannabis oil taken from him by Customs and then returned to him under orders from the Home Office shows how fucked our relationship with drugs is.

1932 2018-06-16 18:51:14 Actually drive-thru's should be banned. World wide. 

You sit there in a car for 5-10-15 minutes idling and burning gasoline. 

Instead of parking it, stopping the engine, and doing some walking into the shop. 

Not only saves gasoline/oil carbon/CO2, but also provides exercise.

1946 2018-06-16 18:48:44 3/4 of Mexico, Central and South America should come? Send planes and boats to Africa? Open borders would end this country.
1947 2018-06-16 18:48:31 @BarackObama You will never get the credit for your response against Putin, because it must remain a secret. But as a trader, all you have to do is look at the price of Oil (Russian economy) in the 18 months following Crimea. You were the best President and truly a decent person
1948 2018-06-16 18:48:25 I care more about the AMERICAN mother who was arrested for having marijuana oil for her sons seizures which was the only thing that saved him from them
1949 2018-06-16 18:48:09 It certainly was a long wait, but worth it! Two new turbos, a clutch, wiring loom, lots of oil seals/gaskets, suspension bits and poly bushes, but if paint... goes like stink and mechanically perfect as well as stunning to look at!

1963 2018-06-16 18:46:23 India has wanted to buy oil in rupee vs euros for 4 years. Actually-back in 2014 , Iran did split buying oil in euro & rupee for a little while. As rupee has weakened vs euro since 2014 , foreign exchange savings motivation still there for India- even though oil price lower now.

Once that happens Scotland will have to look after itself with no subsidies from Westminster. Hopefully for your sake whisky sheep and cheap oil will will suffice
1969 2018-06-16 18:46:02 Well that's an insult to snake oil salesman, but I digress. Lol. And yes, wants the spotlight ever since high school. That old interview saying he was the best actor, and the best athlete. Why does he attack Meryl Streep & Robert De Niro? Jealousy!

1974 2018-06-16 18:45:08 Your sweet peas are so further along than mine. You must have planted them awhile back. Mine are still babies, who knows with this cool weather if they will ever grow  Say have you heard of U.K brand Spatopia? I had their Rose Otto body oil, which I loved, can't find it now.
1975 2018-06-16 18:45:05 Kelly! I need an investor for Male Enlargement Oil! Research this herb....Entengo Mulondo! Then check it out on Amazon...Legend of Entengo Mulondo
1976 2018-06-16 18:45:05 @fordnation Well doug with oil companies we are on the cusp of "bio fuels" already being Aviation capable(Chasing Ice)so it is their own faults they did not develop this fuel sooner so tax incentive to get them to would be practical as we also have to cut our emissions anyway!!
1977 2018-06-16 18:44:58 Mine too, covered in black pepper & oil!!!
1978 2018-06-16 18:44:46 Billy was Given a 20 day Licence, which allowed him to take the #Canabis Oil, which can't be taken home...
This, Isn't Good enough.. The Home Office should legalise #CannabisOil, After other country's have verified it Treats Epilepsy, kills Cancer Cells and is Medicine..
1979 2018-06-16 18:44:33 My mom generous enough to let me use her whip since mine over w so only right to keep it prestige. Oil change & tire rotation as we speak
1980 2018-06-16 18:44:25 Will you have a great time selling off Alaska's grand pristine land to oil drillers?
1981 2018-06-16 18:44:13 Founder of the next Google I'm sure.
1982 2018-06-16 18:44:07 What needs to happen is we need to abandon an oil driven economy and introduce Free Energy systems. They are out there and patented. Why are we fighting this political fight when it is clearly a fight over profits, not the well being of our planet. #wakeup
1983 2018-06-16 18:44:01 Respectfully submitted for your approval,  what you stand for is what's important. Joe Manchin is a Democrat who aligns with Trump. Many Democrats align with big oil fracking polluters and private detention centers.  So,  party labels are no qualifier for the #Woke
1984 2018-06-16 18:43:58 How fried foods affect you depends upon where your ancestors came from, and how long "your people" have been using hot oil to cook their food.

1989 2018-06-16 18:42:55 I’m aware of the lifeline that palm oil provides for people. I wish they wouldn’t have to work unethically, but they’re essentially forced to due to job scarcity. Even then, humans have a gross dependency on palm oil that absolutely needs to be reduced for the sake of the earth.
1990 2018-06-16 18:42:44 Didn't really need dinner yet on account of late lunch. But since it was a peach/tarragon salad, with grapes, and a simple lemon/oil/seasoning dressing, I scoffed it anyway. Beautiful side for grilled stuff (chops, halloumi).
1991 2018-06-16 18:42:39 How about we just abandon the oil based economy and introduce free energy? This is not a political problem. This is an income problem. Free Energy = No profits. #wakeup
1992 2018-06-16 18:42:35 hey friends, have any of you tried cbd oil? does it work for you? im looking into it but there's a lot of info to parse so i'm a bit overwhelmed
1993 2018-06-16 18:42:34 Get the organic coconut oil in the jar
1994 2018-06-16 18:42:25 thank u sophie for giving me oil of every pearls uninside to listen to this whole trip to Yosemite

1996 2018-06-16 18:42:14 With what would you replace palm oil?
Palm oil need less space than other oils.

1998 2018-06-16 18:41:55 Got the oil changed on my car so at least I feel a little productive today.
1999 2018-06-16 18:41:53 Potable water is the new Oil
2000 2018-06-16 18:41:50 Like subsidizing oil and gas for the last 70 years. Everyone seems ok with that solution.

2005 2018-06-16 18:41:23 with Trump (US embassy move to Jerusalem & Iran deal). Zucker & his ilk next move is Palestine. They have been trying for years to get rid of Hamas so they can pillage all of Gaza's oil & gas. Now they are using pages from the Nazi's play book to implement their *final solution.*
2006 2018-06-16 18:41:14 and that's reasonable, I just think that every president we've ever had while I've been alive has had some kind of monster in them, be it ignoring the aids epidemic, starting a war for oil, messing up the justice system to the point of brokenness or separating children
2007 2018-06-16 18:40:50 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. New York City sleeps.
2008 2018-06-16 18:40:49 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
2009 2018-06-16 18:40:49 What is oil pulling?
2010 2018-06-16 18:40:45 yep! unfortunately quinoa salads r pretty tasteless if you don't season dbfh also i'm a big fan of olive oil so
2011 2018-06-16 18:40:44 Humans ruin everything no palm oil
2012 2018-06-16 18:40:42 Paying for new tires, an oil change, and subs is gonna hurt my bank account but it’ll be well worth it
2013 2018-06-16 18:40:40 The whole idea of oil credits is a scam made up by the gurus. Iraq can sell oil on the open market every day of the week for market price.
2014 2018-06-16 18:40:38  Pizza topped with baby arugula,  extra-virgin olive oil, and pineapple.
2015 2018-06-16 18:40:37 We have someone ill visiting (they're sick, but house cleaner was scheduled & they're not up to going to the gym etc.).  Caregiver role has me in my element. Time to break out the pillows, quilts, drinks & food, candles, colour changing essential oil diffuser. Happy as anything.
2016 2018-06-16 18:40:35 Before keeping it aside, coat it in a thin layer of olive oil. This is important.
2017 2018-06-16 18:40:30 Pours annointing oil on Ighalo!!! God will use you in a special way today brother. #SoarSuperEagles #WorldCup
2018 2018-06-16 18:40:26 I ain't giving judgement i just know for a fact she's been offered this oil illegally and refused it now her kids having seizures, that's on her, the law isn't tieing her to a chair stopping her from receiving said donations, her and the UPA are using this kid as a media circus.

2026 2018-06-16 18:40:03 I really hope I have a daughter first. I’d make a shitty father to a boy. Like guy, idk how to grill, change my oil, shit I barely know how to shave my face. 

But if 4 year old Katarina comes at me with a clothes or hair question oh boy is she getting the book.
2027 2018-06-16 18:40:00 Did you use oil too so it sticks to your body? I wanna re-do mine too because I fucked up and use loose powder glitter on its own. But I did confetti with oil & it was amazing!
2028 2018-06-16 18:39:41 Spritz them w water / a little bit of oil
2029 2018-06-16 18:39:40 It always cracks me up when he and his cronies go off about Hollywood "elites" and celebrities. Trump BEGGED to be in movies. He to this day loves to be on camera and would ditch his base in a second if the Hollywood set would accept him. Djt is a snake oil salesman. Nothing more
2030 2018-06-16 18:39:37 Don’t let @sajidjavid and @NickHurdUK off the hook.  It was their confiscation of the oil that created the medical emergency in the first place.  

Don’t be thinking they took a benevolent decision on doctors advice.  They were shitting it that a child might die at their hands.
2031 2018-06-16 18:39:35 2nd that thought & also avoid oligopolies which have restricted human growth and evolution....we have gone from CRT to flat unrolling OLED while we have been fed with ICE vehicles 4 the past 200yrs. due to huge grant investments from oil oligopolies to auto industries R&D!
2032 2018-06-16 18:39:29 All made and transported by oil
2033 2018-06-16 18:39:18 I’m waiting for a grinder, a dry herb vape & my cbd oil to come in the post I am too impatient for this!!!

2039 2018-06-16 18:38:50 Fox News Anchors know that when Trump starts whining, a depressed snail whistles the #starspangledbanner
2040 2018-06-16 18:38:48 My cars due an oil change soon. Can you do that too whilst I have a pint?
2041 2018-06-16 18:38:39 aww thats a shame :( i love em too omg & btw did you season the dish with olive oil?
2042 2018-06-16 18:38:26 And whatever you do, DO NOT tell me this can't be done in the same Britain that when push came to shove, dug over gardens, cut down school railings and gathered all forms of scrap metal to make weapons of war and feed troops and citizens alike. We are at war right now vs oil.
2043 2018-06-16 18:38:22 There are two sides to every spectrum. Check my thread on the quote tweet to see how palm oil production benefits developing countries and how vital it is for their economics and wellbeing.
2044 2018-06-16 18:38:21 For the Hummus,first put tahini and lemon juice, grind for a minute, put garlic and some chickpeas (boiled), grind, scrape n put rest of chickpeas, put olive oil and water in which you boiled chickpeas till the consistency you want.Put salt accordingly and keep grinding till done
2045 2018-06-16 18:38:11 I feel so much better i got my oil change like omg 5,000 miles over and this a brand new car? No.
2046 2018-06-16 18:38:06 My gas tank is on E and I need an oil change but yet, I dont want to do either.

2047 2018-06-16 18:37:14 All these fish oil capsules. 

I remember when the human body produced its own fish oil.
2048 2018-06-16 18:37:10 I should’ve taken a screen shot...it is deleted....it said the US bombed the group attacking the oil crescent
2049 2018-06-16 18:37:09 Guru Mountain Goat nonsense talking about oil credits. Iraq would never sell oil for $32 a barrel that's less than it costs them to get it out of the ground.
2050 2018-06-16 18:37:02 refused the same oil she got from Canada because it's not licensed, yet was happy to import it, meaning making it legal medicinally means more than this kid, any parent would just get it on the sly and give it him anyway, nobody would reach that point

2054 2018-06-16 18:36:29 Red Leicester has no business being anywhere near pasta. Stick to the garlic, oil and chillies with the pasta and eat the cheese afterwards with some fresh bread and red wine.
2055 2018-06-16 18:36:20 Avoid hot water before you start. Baby powder before waxing, baby oil/aloe Vera afterwards… and continue using it for a couple days
2056 2018-06-16 18:36:17 I Luv Vodka!  Spritzer for your linens: 1c Vodka + 1c H2O + 16 drops essential oil: to disinfect & freshen
2057 2018-06-16 18:36:13 Aye! But how do we really know that they're doing a Nazi salute. For all you know they may all be simply patting a large great dane that's be photo-shopped out by evil commie patchouli oil wearing hippies.
2058 2018-06-16 18:36:07 It's pretty simple, for the bread first dissolve yeast in warm water with little sugar and let it stay for 10 mins. Then in the same water put maida, salt and little olive oil and knead till the dough is made. Keep it aside covered for at least 2 hours to let it rise. Done.
2059 2018-06-16 18:35:49 Attempting to insert your head into a Javanese carnivorous pitcher plant after you had 'drunk a little too much gin' would account for your symptoms, for which a half pint of cod liver oil should suffice. Old Jem the gardener will help you with the plant, which you have enraged.
2060 2018-06-16 18:35:40 Make sure and read the ingredient lists of packaged foods, too.  They hide a lot of soy in there.  Vegetable oil is soy.
2061 2018-06-16 18:35:35 Well of course. But they should work that out from purchases too. Or be like "will you buy beard oil?" "will you buy sanitary protection" instead of making it super binary.
2062 2018-06-16 18:35:27 /That's/ what we forgot, more cooking oil!
2063 2018-06-16 18:35:18 I spoil my car more then myself, she got her oil changed today, vacuumed, a bath and she’s getting new smelly things. :-)
2064 2018-06-16 18:35:13 I say; Open up Mars for free drilling and no regulations. The Oil companies will figure out how to get to mars in like 6 months. $$$

2068 2018-06-16 18:34:41 I’ll be over with the oil and booze in about half an hour.  Wear the short towel.
2069 2018-06-16 18:34:20 if salad is an option: kale, chopped orange, grated beetroot, coriander, red onion, splash of olive oil, salt, maybe some sunflower seeds

2075 2018-06-16 18:33:41 @FiestaMart Your hot dog buns at the Dellwood Austin store are ... amazing. Like “taking to Maine later this summer for lobster rolls” amazing. Please tell me the palm oil used is orangutan friendly? Please?
2076 2018-06-16 18:33:36 I hope this is the start of legalised med cannabis, it is the best pain killer by far for a lot of people without addiction. A mates cousin has taken CBD and HTC oil for cancer at a fraction of the price of NHS treatment. He is in remission without chemo, Drs know what he's on.
2077 2018-06-16 18:33:35 In margarine you have the worst of both worlds, "Trans Fats" of chemically extracted vegetable oil and " Saturated Fats" like animal fats. There is no oil or fat worse for your body than "Margarine!" In fact, Margarine is only one (1) Food Molecule away from being "Plastic!
2078 2018-06-16 18:33:32 I know, right?! I've seen lots of people do it so it's not my idea, but some flashing is coated with oil and isn't food safe, so I thought I'd ask the manufacturer directly to be safe

2084 2018-06-16 18:32:37 Or Cayman for that matter. No oil, they import everything so.... ? 
Point-  Cost of production cannot explain the exchange rate.
2085 2018-06-16 18:32:04 Research the ‘secret’ 8 year war we fought in #Oman - We bombed the fuck out of the mountain people and our reward was 50% of all the oil revenues forever more 
2086 2018-06-16 18:32:00 Agree completely, but we do have to recognise it's been allowed, and hope that some serious consideration will be urgently given to other people who could benefit from the oil.
2087 2018-06-16 18:31:42 I like this more than baby oil
2088 2018-06-16 18:31:38 It’s not contagious after the initial oil is washed off!!!!!
2089 2018-06-16 18:31:38 I just got mine at a local grocery store. It’s 100% grapefruit oil. I put it on any acne before I go to bed at night. It will sting a little bit, a lot if you use too much. But it works wonders. Has turned my face completely around.

2092 2018-06-16 18:31:31 I never said it wasn't addictive, everything is addictive if u want it to be. But this is the OIL that we are talking about here, the THC Has been removed so it doesn't make you high like when u smoke it.
2093 2018-06-16 18:31:31 Supreme bottle of oil dropping soon, available on ebay. $700.
2094 2018-06-16 18:31:29 1 year ago I was in Russia, 3 years ago I was in Pompeii, and today I sit waiting for an oil change.

It has the assumption the lining material will stick to the inner of the supply lines (which might contain mud etc.). But lines can perhaps ber cleaned (remember that James Bond movie, when he traveled through an oil

2100 2018-06-16 18:30:55 Been listening to @LBC most of the day. So many positive stories about cannabis oil saving lives and making people being able to exist without pain. The UK need to step it up NOW. 
2101 2018-06-16 18:30:55 @BLMNational: Drilling threatens to alter caribou migrations and lower birth rates, risking the Gwich’in way of life. Leasing the #ArcticRefuge for oil and gas development is simply wrong. Is it really worth the risk? #ProtectTheArctic #NoArcticLeases

2110 2018-06-16 18:29:55 tell me why I really spent $22 on medicinal lavender oil for my belly ring? 
2111 2018-06-16 18:29:34 Make your hair grow faster : Grapeseed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
2112 2018-06-16 18:29:33 wow maybe he’s scolding himself bcos he’s tempted to wash his hair with this new shampoo that I recommended, one that would leave his hair oil free (hence removing his iconic oily(?) hair)......
ok I need sleep
2113 2018-06-16 18:29:29 Certainly! Germany isn’t the only country with palm oil production. Yes, palm oil use is beneficial in many ways for human use. The means in which we acquire it is SO harmful to the environment and animal life. Our means are selfish. I can promise you that’s fact.
2114 2018-06-16 18:29:29 Got here for my oil change and they tell me its gonna be 45 minutes... does it really take that long to change oil?
2115 2018-06-16 18:29:26 $80 for a oil change and $40 to fill up 
2116 2018-06-16 18:29:21 It’s like you guys lost your mind! Elite? Have you seen the Elites on the Republican Party? They get millions from NRA, Insurance Companies, Gas and Oil anyone that needs a law to disappear the Repubs are happy to help! As long as you pay them that is.
2117 2018-06-16 18:29:04 literally one and done!! i was so fed up w them after like a week. i got the cat eye style and it looked nice but my face just felt dirty bc couldnt fully wash it. im now using castor oil which has helped a ton to recover my baby lashes lol
2118 2018-06-16 18:29:01 How do they get the baby oil out of the baby?
2119 2018-06-16 18:28:53 I will vote my values, which means progressive Dems, and if the field narrows to weak Dem over Republican, I will support weak Dem. But weak Dems are part of the problem- like the one we used to have in my state that was in the pocket of big oil.

2121 2018-06-16 18:28:41 Will UK Government have to now appreciate and legislate for medical cannabis to be made available for us here. Children who have life threatening epilepsy seizures, cease when Cannabis oil with small amount of THC and CBD #bbcqt #phitchens #bbctw
2122 2018-06-16 18:28:39 I don't have a curious cat, but I have a question. 
What is your favorite, non digital medium?
Mine is either oil pastel or sharpy.
2123 2018-06-16 18:28:20 Fair to say that different aspects of this appealed to different mobsters. For the Kremlin crowd, lifting sanctions was prime. What is Xi's end game in this? Access to oil maybe?. Trump is, as always, primarily motived by increased status & greed.

2129 2018-06-16 18:27:53 Reports say Ambazonia fighters pocket Ekona Town and have their eyes set next to Buea the chosen capital of Ambazonia. We are still asking the international community not to put oil interest over the life of innocent people!
2130 2018-06-16 18:27:47 10/10 recommend CBD oil for any of you mf that struggle w/ anxiety or sleep issues like myself , it’s wonderful 
2131 2018-06-16 18:27:22 Separated by a galon of oil and some million dollars
2132 2018-06-16 18:26:47 Found a restaurant which doesn't fry in soybean or peanut oil! French fries, I'm coming for you tonight!
2133 2018-06-16 18:26:32 NHS will save so much money in cutting out unneeded appointments and expensive drugs if only GPs can prescribe CBD oil for many symptoms and ailments. Why not have urgent extensive consultation on legalising medical cannabis Mrs M @theresa_may?
2134 2018-06-16 18:26:07 yeah, I got this Aztec clay and I opened it up and stuck my finger inside and it's all separated. Like there is oil, and then there are granules and this feels like some next level shit.

2139 2018-06-16 18:25:13 Exactly Jake, very good point. Maldonado was purely a pay driver in F1, which is why his F1 career ended at the same instant his Venezuelan oil millions dried up.

2142 2018-06-16 18:24:38 This should never have happened. Cannabis oil should be legal in this country for medicinal purposes. I see the severity of side effects of legal epilepsy medicine and they are brutal and heartbreaking. #familymember

2145 2018-06-16 18:24:32 Wait, sorry, didn’t understand what you were replying to. Also, wtf??

To clarify, lithium pools aren’t really that terrible. Not compared to end to end life cycle for oil. Tesla fan isn’t wrong there. 

I know where the claim is coming from and that study was debunked.
2146 2018-06-16 18:24:21 My skin smells like summer thanks to Gold Bond Ultimate Hydrating Lotion Radiance Renewal Cream Oil. 
2147 2018-06-16 18:24:18 And on same day vetoing #FinnsLaw yet today sudden (correct) reversal to allow cannabis oil for medical purpose. I must be thick cos I don’t see the consistency here
2148 2018-06-16 18:23:48 @Zori_C  there are lots of thai chicken salad recipes & some restaurants sell it. I do a thai tuna salad, rice vinegar, sesame oil, red pepper, granulated sugar, cilantro & chopped green onions, chopped peanuts.
2149 2018-06-16 18:23:41 I don't really drink alcohol at all in general, but generally I found wine to be more tolerable in taste than beer, which tastes like drinking oil. :v
2150 2018-06-16 18:23:38 pharma drugs dont always work for seizures neither does the brain implant. if the oil works give it to him simple
2151 2018-06-16 18:23:33 Gov is misleading on hike in petrol/diesel price  to the public. They need to publish the graph where the crude oil price v/s price of petrol. You would be surprised that the Gov never lowered price even when crude oil price was low .
2152 2018-06-16 18:23:24 2 cups milk, 1/3 cup canola oil, 4 eggs, 2 cups flour, 1/3 cup sugar, pinch of salt

Whisk it together, cook in frying pan on medium high, about a third cup batter per crepe. When the outer rim turns brown, flip it over w a spatula and cook for ~15 more sec.

Voila, crepes :)
2153 2018-06-16 18:23:21 I broke the law... grew my own plants and then made my own oil following the Rick Simpson method. Only medication that has ever helped my MS.
2154 2018-06-16 18:23:15 just now had time to listen to oil of every pearls uninsides and ... 
2155 2018-06-16 18:23:12 I would just like to publicly thank @Noah_Mullenax for being a real OG and helping me and @kirstchristmas figure out oil problems in the middle of the night while we were stuck in Atlanta 
2156 2018-06-16 18:23:02 Haircut done!

Now getting car inspection, oil change and tire rotation
2157 2018-06-16 18:22:55 Exactly! When the role of real estate in economy is more than 20% of GDP while mining, oil and gas extraction all together is 8%, #BOC decision to cut the already too low rates to 0.5% was a real mistake!
2158 2018-06-16 18:22:43 No; just regular ones I'll pan-fry in a slightly* unhealthy amount of olive oil.

2161 2018-06-16 18:22:28 spinach, tomato, banana peppers, green peppers, oil and vinegar, chipotle mayo, honey mustard, tuna, jalapeños, onion, olives, pickles, and like four kinds of bread
2162 2018-06-16 18:22:26 Peanut oil?
2163 2018-06-16 18:22:14 Yes sir. I do my own oil changes just bc it’s cheapest for me and I want to know for sure what is being put in. I use Mobile1 full synthetic and Mopar OEM filter. Mobile1 is really high quality. Oil change runs me about $42 and I go 5-7k miles. Fk walkin in 100 degree TX heat. 
2164 2018-06-16 18:22:07 brett and I just had a legit argument about if scented wax melts or oil warmers are better so I guess you could say we're taking out marriage to the next level
2165 2018-06-16 18:22:07 I’ve been following thecSyrian War daily for several years and really it’s no less a savage debacle as Iraq or Libya - or were those wars justified? There were no moderate rebels only various shades of terrorists. And now the US controls 50% of the oil. Nuanced enough?
2166 2018-06-16 18:22:00 I work in oil and gas. I am an engineering manager. I am super familiar with the EPA. The myth that we are the largest polluters is another manipulated number. OUR PEOPLE are the biggest polluters. Our industry is not. We have some of the tightest EPA regs in the world.
2167 2018-06-16 18:21:58 You don't Police the world you invade countries with oil and take it. It's called plundering, get it right.
2168 2018-06-16 18:21:56 Got oil last night at Walmart for 8 sum. Went this afternoon same oil 4 sum 
2169 2018-06-16 18:21:33 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
2170 2018-06-16 18:21:26 Response, qoute whatever. My point is that exchange rates can't be used to compare economies. You might as well say that Trinidad has oil which Japan lacks, that's why Japan's exchange rate is over 100. Trying to explain the rate via cost of production makes no sense.
2171 2018-06-16 18:21:17 “ONLY ONE PLAYER USES THEIR HANDS”- dead
2172 2018-06-16 18:21:05 Went to take Anthony’s car for an oil change and they noticed my baby bump and kept calling me Mrs. Garcia lol 
2173 2018-06-16 18:21:03 So I see the Home Secretary has finally intervened to allow that young lad with epilepsy to continue to use his cannabis oil which was confiscated off his parents after they flew to Canada to get it.  Hopefully this is the start of this backwards country getting its act together
2174 2018-06-16 18:21:01 Yeee had to do oil change
2175 2018-06-16 18:20:56 country sun is the reason why Im alive walking on this planet.
2176 2018-06-16 18:20:53 Recently let go of my last ICE car at 9 years. (Last 6 years a backup to my Nissan Leaf for longer drives.) Lifetime 36mpg and a little over 100K miles I bought over $9K in gas and another $500 in oil changes. Would have been about $2K electricity. $7500 less. Honda step up.
2177 2018-06-16 18:20:48 落ち着いて？？？？？？？？？？？？？？？？？？？？？そういえば今日レンタルショップで見たかもしんないな？？？？？？？？？？？？？？？？
2178 2018-06-16 18:20:48 I really don't know why I didn't buy groceries. Now I'm left with chicken livers, salt, herbs & oil. I'll make it work.
2179 2018-06-16 18:20:34 Y’all should’ve seen the oil field worker tho he was an ugly cryer lol
2180 2018-06-16 18:20:30 Can somebody explain to me why oil is so important? I'm very stupid.
2181 2018-06-16 18:20:28 Cooked dinner tonight for a couple of vegetarians, a coeliac, and someone who is allergic to both dairy and soya. 

Basic, Indian, vegetarian food hits the spot every time. (Rice, dahl, and subzi - roasted kale with smoked paprika, and rapeseed oil tonight).
2182 2018-06-16 18:20:21 Estamos contigo AMLO, pues en León, Gto. López Santillana del PAN, hizo acuerdos con los concesionarios de MOBIL OIL, y en todos los talleres mecánicos, están pintados con recursos de esta empresa americana
2183 2018-06-16 18:20:20 I bought it when the dealer over tightened the filter on my Forester and the "screwdriver trick" had already failed. Over tight, bent up filter, covered with oil was still no issue for it.
2184 2018-06-16 18:20:04 Case is prejudices what kind of MPs and MLAs BJP has that doesn't know how this country runs and how law works . Really that's why they are only doing blunder and wasting our time when crude oil is low price and monsoon is good. They destroy our country.
2185 2018-06-16 18:20:01 @NoEggCraig Question. You claim to be Vegan? Do you wear anything made out of Silk? Or anything containing plastic? Do you use anything plastic? 'cause plastic is made out of Oil, and oil technically comes from ancient animals.

"Do I have a choice?"

2200 2018-06-16 18:18:36 What a ridiculous situation. One can be prescribed amphetamines, heroin, diazepam and even methadone. But one can’t prescribe cannabis oil for a little lad who’s proved its efficacy in epilepsy…
Bloody 3rd world country.

2202 2018-06-16 18:18:30 can anyone in america PLEASE tell me what’s available at usa subways.....i just served an older couple from new york that were outraged that we didn’t have sriracha, spinach, carrot, olive oil, or swiss cheese
2203 2018-06-16 18:18:26 Spent 56$ at auto zone on some tools. Time to finally get this stripped bolt off and change my oil. I guess jiffy and Goodyear won’t change your oil if the oil bleed screw is stripped 
2204 2018-06-16 18:18:24 Sickening the fact that boy Billy’s mum had to fight for that cannabis oil when they knew fine well it was working on him, ridiculous

5) You dont know why all perishable and non perishable goods at higher price??

2211 2018-06-16 18:17:45 So the tariffs hitting the middle of the country, steel users, and farmers is of no concern to you. Gas and oil prices going up have erased any tax decrease benefit and the man is morally bankrupt and an embarrassment to America. He lies daily to the american people but no prob.
2212 2018-06-16 18:17:43 Having said that, I would not be surprised that should such evidence exist it wouldn’t see the light of day. Otherwise it could cause hugely (expensive) problems for the oil industry.
2213 2018-06-16 18:17:39 You don't need government to do things about cannabis oil. You just need  customs officers who turn a blind eye, or DWP advisers who don't 'just follow orders' and sanction people to death. Just be a human being and things will work out OK.

2221 2018-06-16 18:16:34 @sajidjavid excellent decision to allow the youngster to have his oil treatment, you are an example of good old common sense, thank you Home Secretary, you’re a star, well done. Mrs May knew what this country needed when she chose you.
2222 2018-06-16 18:16:30 Zindabad @sajidjavid on your decision to allow that kids parents to use cannabis oil for his treatment. I hope this is a step in the right direction. These are the kinds of decisions that secure votes.

2228 2018-06-16 18:15:26 This isn't really pro-trade, though. It's pro-Americans-just-taking-shit-from-other-countries. If you look at his track record of foreign policy statements (e.g.: Americans should get half the oil from Libya/Iran), it's a position he's been really consistent about.

2240 2018-06-16 18:14:22 Cannabis oil is out here stabilising epileptic children
2241 2018-06-16 18:14:15 It's like all the Xalimos were told to gather at Oil Libya Parklands. Can't drive through without almost hitting one.
2242 2018-06-16 18:13:55 @BBCNews just to clarify,cannabis oil isn't banned in the UK. Oil containing THC IS banned but CBD only isn't. Both are cannabis oils.
2243 2018-06-16 18:13:52 Is Vitamin E oil good for the skin ?
2244 2018-06-16 18:13:36 I’d have used a good olive oil, personally, but delicious? You bet. The most underrated root vegetable.
2245 2018-06-16 18:13:36 Girl i just use the Sephora mattefying moisturizer it’s $8 and my face doesn’t look like an oil slick when I leave work anymorw
2246 2018-06-16 18:13:34 True indicator of having your shit together: the outside of your olive oil bottle is not oily
2247 2018-06-16 18:13:23 And will make peanut butter look like coconut oil.
2248 2018-06-16 18:13:20 unpopular opinion: oil pastels are just  expensive crayons for grown-ups
2249 2018-06-16 18:13:19 My cars tells me to "add engine oil by 1 litre". Surely how can this one not be even more specific that that

2251 2018-06-16 18:13:11 something 'iffy' about that opening game..Russian oil or prostitutes offered is my best guess.
2252 2018-06-16 18:13:02 I have been using rose hip oil for like 2 days and that shit is magic wtf
2253 2018-06-16 18:12:57 Been trying different ways of cooking tofu and so far the one that turned out by far the best was frying it in vegetable oil and sprinkling on some salt, cayenne pepper and bell pepper. Nice 'n crispy
2254 2018-06-16 18:12:57 Is CBD? Oil legal here? Sure I have seen some on sale
2255 2018-06-16 18:12:46 If a network service provider and an oil refinery are operating 24hrs a day,why would a bank be closed anytime at all??
2256 2018-06-16 18:12:46 Put it in a pan with a bit of whatever kind of oil you like with garlic. Carrots onion and peppers are my favorite. Cut off the white part inside of peppers it is gross.
2257 2018-06-16 18:12:43 There is no law to separate, you are in control of the House, Senate, and Judiciary. This is on you same as health care failing is on you, same as high gas and oil that has wiped out any tax gain all on you. Wait for Tariff to hurt us workers, also on you.
2258 2018-06-16 18:12:32 I have bamboo canes that are 100 years old plus. I treat them with linseed oil occasionally and it keeps them supple and useable
2259 2018-06-16 18:12:24 Also vegetable oil is terrible I agree .. EVOO has fat but is generally healthier than corn oil & grape seed would be my #1 recommendation for oil
2260 2018-06-16 18:12:18 That’s what krill oil capsules are for!
2261 2018-06-16 18:11:57 Last time I was torn between being salty she just washed my perfume oil off and so relaxed bc she just washed my arm with two different kinds of shampoos and conditioners.
2262 2018-06-16 18:11:23 I always wanted to try a cleansing oil. You’re doing gods work here.
2263 2018-06-16 18:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza of the day will be: chewy crust with stale coconut oil and egg.
2264 2018-06-16 18:11:02 Pardoning Manafort would be a clear "conflict of interest" and would probably be then deemed "obstruction of justice" because Trump would be covering up a crime that implicates the pardoner - Trump.  But isn't this crap enough to boil em' in oil...
2265 2018-06-16 18:10:57 Remember what happened to Venezuela after they found oil...

*has a vivid flashback to taking 2 drops of THC oil before lunch*
2268 2018-06-16 18:10:42 Have you tried battles maggot oil ?
2269 2018-06-16 18:10:34 Hopefully he’ll be OK now that Home Secretary @SajidJavid has used his superpowers: “This morning, I’ve used an exceptional power as Home Secretary to urgently issue a licence to allow Billy Caldwell to be treated with cannabis oil...
2270 2018-06-16 18:10:31 Another 300$ to get my car serviced with an oil change. Does that sound about right to any one else that has a Mercedes?

2272 2018-06-16 18:10:17 Which oil billionaire owns Bayern?
2273 2018-06-16 18:10:10 I loved your original point re no source of power being without consequences. Policy decisions need to revolve around the costs-benefits. Mostly I sing the virtues of power that makes sense. Hydro in BC. Perhaps nuclear in Sask. Oil in Alta. Etc.

2275 2018-06-16 18:09:57 Now is the time to be preparing “extra oil” before it’s too late.
2276 2018-06-16 18:09:56 @jimmyjohns How might I acquire an oil drum of #KickinRanch?
2277 2018-06-16 18:09:42 Maybe you should visit a powerstation and see how the start a unit. Take into consideration how they were designed. The coal calorific value, coal quality, water to be turned into steam, our raw water conditions, oil burners etc. Its not starting a bmw. The people are competent
2278 2018-06-16 18:09:36 I got baby oil all over my phone
2279 2018-06-16 18:09:03 Vitamin e oil
2280 2018-06-16 18:09:01 Indeed, I was thinking more along the lines of Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting, a few billion years of Solar energy left in the sun so energy isn’t the problem.  When people tell me ‘surely it’ll be too complicated’  you just need to look at an Oil refinery. Its possible  /1
2281 2018-06-16 18:08:55 I feel stupid as fuck getting an oil change when they pull the oil stick out and show it to you  Idk wth I’m actually looking at 
2282 2018-06-16 18:08:20 The man is nothing but a Grifter- what used to be called in the days his Grandfather was grifting our west, a snake oil salesman. He's from a long line of thieves, thugs & racists. His $ comes from cheating & illegal activities & now he's pulled off the greatest con never!
2283 2018-06-16 18:08:15 I did just start eating fish oil capsules though so maybe that will help some too
2284 2018-06-16 18:08:05 In 1994, economist Pius Okigbo examined the books of the CBN; he reported (as he left the country) that $12.6 billion were not accounted for. The skimming of oil profits had indeed reached astronomical proportions. According to you, you were a minister during that ignoble era.
2285 2018-06-16 18:08:00 Pls stop.   Your facts are fabrications.   High oil prices and inflation has sucked away any small increases in pay due to tax law changes, smh....
2286 2018-06-16 18:07:48 I need to get an oil change for my car. I’m determined to get it done today. I’ve been telling myself I’ll get it done everyday for the past week..
2287 2018-06-16 18:07:43 Will the effects last or now that you stopped will it come back? I used to take a pill but the moment I stoped it all came back cause the pill would stop my oil.
2288 2018-06-16 18:07:33 Hahaaa. White and straggle is like oil and water don’t mix. Here is the right slogan that will suit well for DA: “privilege continues”.
2289 2018-06-16 18:07:30 I just used vegetable oil which isn't the best choice but mostly now just make sure it gets used for bacon regularly. 

Careful with cheap metal tongs as they can scrape it.
2290 2018-06-16 18:07:21 no it was just mayo made with avocado oil 
2291 2018-06-16 18:07:13 I did jasmine rice with feta, cucumber, tomato, olive oil and lemon dressing a few days back. I know the rice with that sauce is perfect, it's just been so hot here.
2292 2018-06-16 18:06:35 if there was oil i'd hit it by now that's how deep i am lol
2293 2018-06-16 18:06:32 I'm glad u r allowed your cannabis oil Billy I hope it helps your epilepsy
2294 2018-06-16 18:06:07 かとんさんぐれしょ？？？（ｸﾞﾙｸﾞﾙ
2295 2018-06-16 18:05:51 Cannabis oil looks to be a very effective treatment, helps with pain and sleep, increases appetite. Some credit it with curative properties. Doesn't appear to be much of a downside.
2296 2018-06-16 18:05:51 I just kept thinking about how her hands probably smelled like old canola oil after putting the tub back in the fridge.

All my feelings disappeared instantly.
2297 2018-06-16 18:05:51 honestly cannot believe they aren't allowing a little boy with epilepsy to have cannabis oil... i believe that it should be available to people even with anxiety issues tbh there is no danger anywhere literally NOBODY has died from weed
2298 2018-06-16 18:05:45 i told Will i wanted to just smoke bud for a little bit cause oil doesn’t get me that stoned anymore and he freakin laughed. Like boi fuck you
2299 2018-06-16 18:05:00 Oil
2300 2018-06-16 18:04:51 We could stop industry, quit driving, end oil production, stop breathing yet your plan makes NO difference whatsoever to climate. None.  What can we do?  Eliminate coal power, convert ships from bunker to NatGas, add incentives for newer diesel/hybrid vehicles, add Nuclear power
2301 2018-06-16 18:04:40 Brooooo I feel this everyone wants to be expensive for shit the solution is to just start smoking a lot of oil
2302 2018-06-16 18:04:28 Before you all congratulate the home Secretary are you aware it's only a special 20 day licence which requires the oil to stay in hospital?  So after 20 days it's back to square 1 or frequent renewals and daily trips to the hospital.  It's a start but a long way off a solution.
2303 2018-06-16 18:04:27 Coffee, food, and CBD oil have all failed my headache.
2304 2018-06-16 18:04:11 omg she sure does. and then she was talking about how I needed to go and put anointing oil around his chair and on his desk and I laughed
2305 2018-06-16 18:04:07 You know you is poor when you mix vegetable oil, corn starch and tomato paste, and vegan coconut creamer to make pasta sauce. #atleastitwasntketchupsketti
2306 2018-06-16 18:04:05 Here here sir. Join the campaign to clinical trials of CBD OIL ,as to date there are none. Hospitals are not allowed to tedt due to cannabis being illegal, but they use heroin based pain killers everyday.
2307 2018-06-16 18:03:53 There's oil shock inflation and then there's everything else. The inflation CB's want is not that.
2308 2018-06-16 18:03:53 I do the “curly girl method” for my hair, so typically I’ll do a cowash with silicone-free conditioner, then after showering I do a leave in conditioner, then a cream or gel, then an oil. Works well, but usually humidity is super low here.
2309 2018-06-16 18:03:45 What's so complex about a boy with epilepsy needing the oil he is given to stop seizures? Time for you all to get your head out your arses and wake up!!
2310 2018-06-16 18:03:39 It’s hot af. I only went to take my mom’s car to get the oil changed and after sitting there waiting on them to finish I felt like I was about to break a sweat.

2315 2018-06-16 18:03:03 Remember in South Africa we don't have oil and we buy it from other countries. If we still  use USD do trade price are still going to increase. We must come with new way to solve this. We as African we must develop our trading current.

2319 2018-06-16 18:02:50 I went on the Warrior when it was used as an oil jetty at Pembroke Dock, it looks a lot better now than it did then.
2320 2018-06-16 18:02:43 We need to figure out how to make this work....  but also there are dog allergies at the house, aren’t there? Hence Rosie and antiallergen fur..., are there not?  And BIS just got a bath last night... he smells like baby powder and tea tree oil! Lmao.
2321 2018-06-16 18:02:18 I think the whole currency and production cost thing is a little more nuanced than having oil and same causing production to be cheaper. Other factors are critical, I believe.
2322 2018-06-16 18:02:16 Back then too banks were the main bottleneck, I believe; Oil sale would not have been snarled as much if it had not been for financial transaction blockage.
2323 2018-06-16 18:01:43 bio oil katanya ga recommended di muka sih. saran aku pake aztec mask, sumpah gaboong bekas jerawat ilang dan pd bilang muka aku bersihan pdhl baru pake 3 bulan. dicampur sama acv
2324 2018-06-16 18:01:13 Big oil & gas want him where he is, Trump said so, said they love the job he’s doing for them, enough said..
Btw, it’s no longer the Environmental Protection Agency to the rest of the world, it’s now the Environmental Polluters Agency..
2325 2018-06-16 18:01:06 Ever read Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930?  Meant to help America out of the Great Depression. Ever live thru oil embargo of the 1970's? Gas lines & only being able to purchase 10 gals on odd/even day you were allowed. Tariffs don't work they only cause higher cost of goods.
2326 2018-06-16 18:00:56 we ended up buying a new nectar collector and 9 grams of oil 
2327 2018-06-16 18:00:32 Okay. I love their stuff (almond shower oil, almond skin oil) but the fragrant hand creams aren’t strong enough for hands. Lol. I’ll try the regular shea lotions. Thanks!

2331 2018-06-16 17:59:37 Our currency policy is skewed entirely towards Wall Street profiteers and big oil. Example: the petrodollar. It is not made with you in mind, polite internet flame man.
2332 2018-06-16 17:59:28 It was good!!!  Bought a little packet of spices (its made by Schwartz)  and you add oil, white wine vinegar and rum to it and leave the meat marinating in it overnight.  Next time I'll add a bit more rum than it says on the packet ;)
2333 2018-06-16 17:59:21 Iran and Syria and Relaxing. Do you see how they can handle their own countries problems when Israel is Chemical attacking them trying to pin it on Assad? Just to take over land for oil, israel is the largest supporter of terrorism than the United States
2334 2018-06-16 17:59:19 Have fun on my stomping grounds! Haha. Stop in at North Fork Brewery for some epic brews and pizza. If you go hiking, I recommend Skyline Divide if it's open. Enjoy!

Very sticky hair
2336 2018-06-16 17:59:03 Picked my cousin up at @WestHerr Kia so she could leave her car for a “quick” oil change. Two hours later they hadn’t touched it and seemed totally ok with that w/ no apology or notice As the daughter of a dealership manager, WTF? That would never fly at another place.
2337 2018-06-16 17:58:58 I absolutely hate to be this guy, but: cypress oil.
2338 2018-06-16 17:58:52 Wake up 430

16 oz water & a banana to wash down vitamins, L-lysine, fish oil while coffee makes

Whey protein, dehydrated peanut butter, creatine milk shake ~ 45-50 grams protein before heading out the door with black coffee
2339 2018-06-16 17:58:50 ah yes, olive oil. the spice of life
2340 2018-06-16 17:58:45 First, “uninformed” is one word. Without Canada’s crude the U.S. would likely enjoy a healthy trade surplus with Canada but at the expense of more dependence on OPEC countries for our oil. Such dependence would likely mean higher oil prices for consumers and less energy security.
2341 2018-06-16 17:58:30 Don't forget environmental assessments for offshore oil!
2342 2018-06-16 17:58:16 Alhamdulilah on your behalf bro. That's the beginning of great things coming.
2343 2018-06-16 17:58:08 Sustaining oil production is critical for the economic and financial survivor of Libyans. The meddling of different players with the country's oil infrastructure must stop.
2344 2018-06-16 17:57:58 Big oil love him
2345 2018-06-16 17:57:55 Having oil doesn't = low production costs; and Low production costs doesn't = high valued currencies. See Japan. 1 Yen =
0.0090 USD, less than the JMD.
2346 2018-06-16 17:57:30 Me: in my house everyday is karthigai lalala
Mom: dai moodevi there is no money for buying oil anymore.
2347 2018-06-16 17:57:23 You’re right about the difference in the quality of the crude. But the price difference is primarily a function of supply and demand. West Texas Intermediary(ie Oklahoma) has an oil glut due to local production and therefore US paying well below market price.
2348 2018-06-16 17:57:18 i wish i had a boyfriend to put my tanning oil on my back and legs rn 
2349 2018-06-16 17:57:10 Change the oil alert?? 
2350 2018-06-16 17:56:55 And you are completely wrong, I have the power of cod liver oil and it allows me to see the future where none of that occurs
2351 2018-06-16 17:56:53 aaaaa cooool, i knew oil did that but i've never actually seen it happen
2352 2018-06-16 17:56:21 Yess they’re so good! This is over cream cheese and an arugula/garlic/yogurt sauce I had on hand. Also works with avocado, oil/vinegar, sprouts, or butter/salt.

2362 2018-06-16 17:54:25 Wouldn't you think the oil stopping seizures for a year for this child be of interest to epilepsy experts ?
2363 2018-06-16 17:54:23 There's nothing more Midwestern than slathering on a few inches of what's essentially cooking oil and baking in the sun, like a hot dog in a gas station machine.

2369 2018-06-16 17:52:43 just reading about a similar case in the paper now, a mother had her sons cannabis oil confiscated at Heathrow. Stops his seizures, should be legal!
2370 2018-06-16 17:52:41 Does anyone know if all this oil exploration has any effect on Cod populations?
2371 2018-06-16 17:52:40 That oil a motherfucker
2372 2018-06-16 17:52:35 What a bunch of twats,I'm on CBD oil,the hemp version,which is legal in the UK, I presume he has the cannabis version from America.

2376 2018-06-16 17:51:21 There’s this car shop behind my store and I got my oil changed and they cleaned and washed my car for free 
2377 2018-06-16 17:51:00 So the business of “high-end” coffee is really saturated.

I’m considering starting a line of very low-cost, budget coffee.

Possible flavors:

“Police Station Interview”
“Complimentary Motel Breakfast”
“Oil Change Waiting Area”
“Office Break Room”
“United Airlines”
2378 2018-06-16 17:50:52 I have found for my digestive issues that the oil is the most important thing. Sometimes even peppermint gum offers a little relief so syrup might help. (I'm sorry I didn't bring my bag of tricks for guts to campus today.)
2379 2018-06-16 17:50:45 I sometimes forget all people don’t know the history behind bastille songs, I saw someone the other day putting oil on water in a the adventure zone playlist and I’m like ????? You think Lucretia is a hoe????
2380 2018-06-16 17:50:39 Controlling Sonic in the SA games is like trying to control a bar of soap on ice. Covered in oil.

2383 2018-06-16 17:50:18 I buy it in amazon, you can get it in target or Walmart but the ones that say 100% Argan oil and have no additives work better. 
2384 2018-06-16 17:50:15 In 2017, the 12-year-old became the first person in the UK to be prescribed cannabis oil, but last month his GP was told he could no longer do so.

@Baited_man 

Home office revoked it

2386 2018-06-16 17:50:04 I recently saw the president flagging off tracks carrying crude oil to mombasa ila kwa budget they hv increased the price of kerosene, it's just irony the life we are livin' in kenya
2387 2018-06-16 17:49:52 you make a claim that extracting lithium (and didn't list an amount of lithium) is worse than the extraction and refinery of all of the oil in the past 500 years. You can't just go around saying shit like that without proof.

2397 2018-06-16 17:47:38 I AGREE, a topical works for pain relief.  Yet, one must understand with RH (Rheumatoid Arthritis) you must change your eating habits.  Medicine or topical creme/oil/lotions/ointments are just masking reliefs~ #chronicpain #HealthForAll #Holistic #pain #healing #wellness
2398 2018-06-16 17:47:25 You have no evidence to back that up, the withdrawal of the oil has deteriorated his condition substantially and if this is the most effective treatment for her child than why the hell would she want anything less. I still don't see the point of your tweet.
2399 2018-06-16 17:47:18 What if we were to spend it on saving orangutans from bulldozers of palm oil farmers?
2400 2018-06-16 17:47:09 Nice 6 units will give you some redundancy. Heat pumps make very little new heat only moves excsisting heat plus no pollution. Win win. Nuclear oil and gas all make new heat.
2401 2018-06-16 17:46:56 It’s amazing how all Arab nations watch TV, drive cars, use mobile phones, amass huge wealth exporting oil to the USA, UK and France in high-tech shipping vessels, shop for French designer clothes and perfumes, fly in Boeings and Airbuses to have their children born in the USA.
2402 2018-06-16 17:46:36 Chef Kawasaki cut up some potatoes, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was veal, along with cheese.
2403 2018-06-16 17:46:00 If you haven't tried cbd oil yet, what are you waiting for? My friend Darryl @DarrylFatand50  gives great information about it and sells it! Help him out and help yourself out at the same time. He is a full time caregiver for his wife, who has a chronic illness. #fibromyalgia

2414 2018-06-16 17:44:24 I would venture to say all oil, in fact all matter, is full of chemicals
2415 2018-06-16 17:44:24 We have the candles that hold oil. Not real ones for daily mass.
2416 2018-06-16 17:44:11 Need some baby oil?
2417 2018-06-16 17:44:01 Boring is how we get to the oil :)
2418 2018-06-16 17:43:56 The capitalists rob the planet, rip it open for oil and gold, and leave us with nothing but labor.
2419 2018-06-16 17:43:38 How to make the perfect Sweet Potatoes in an Airfryer
1. Clean sweet potatoes  & poke holes w fork
2. Spread evenly 1 Tbsp olive oil 
3. Place sweet potatoes in Airfryer. Turn up to 395 deg F for 45 mins
4. Halve potatoes, lightly salt & brush on a bit of honey  
Enjoy 
2420 2018-06-16 17:43:27 If vegetable oil is made from vegetables, what's baby powder made of.
2421 2018-06-16 17:43:08 The only thing trump is good at, is selling snake oil.
2422 2018-06-16 17:42:49 Hey hey. We provide a natural hypo allergenic massage oil. But if sensitive in the 'hoo ha' area we don't recommend for inside. So bringing some coconut oil for the actual YONI part is a good idea.
2423 2018-06-16 17:42:32 I would like to thank @sajidjavid for using his exceptional power to provide #BillyCaldwell with life saving CBD oil I would like to now call upon all MPs to use exceptional BRAIN POWER to elevate themselves out of the dark ages and make CBD oil and medical marijuana legal
2424 2018-06-16 17:42:31 Essential oil class at 6pm @cafeloka on Monday!
2425 2018-06-16 17:42:05 coconut oil annoying as hell when it melt. that jawnt be everywhere.
2426 2018-06-16 17:42:05 So looking at other countries with oil...and other countries that produce a ton of things at very low cost that still have higher exchange rates. You know you're wrong. Too ez
2427 2018-06-16 17:42:03 if you think your life sucks, just know I’m allergic to coconuts so I can’t drink Malibu or use coconut oil
2428 2018-06-16 17:42:03 I just want to be a good person who takes care of his family, helps people, and makes the future much less dependent on oil and other fossil fuels.
2429 2018-06-16 17:42:01 Same, but different mediums allow more room for mistakes. There's no going back wth watercolor, by oil can be workable for days.
2430 2018-06-16 17:41:59 Bring Your Own Boy? Bottle? Baby oil?

2440 2018-06-16 17:40:03 Karen’s dad just taught me how to change my oil. 

Karen’s dad doesn’t speak a sentence of English and he is a very detailed teacher. That was a fun experience.
2441 2018-06-16 17:39:53 We need ppl in both long and short games. Elon's working to get us off oil and to begin opening the solar system to our species. Tho it may seem superfluous, this kind of work has crazy levels of short term benefits too. You are right about $ imbalances, but we can fight >1 fight
2442 2018-06-16 17:39:41 Got my oil change got me something to eat now back to bed I go until game night tonight
2443 2018-06-16 17:39:29 I think your mixing up the US air strike with the attack on the oil fields
2444 2018-06-16 17:39:26 I agree I have been a fan of the Oil since 79 and I get tired of the casual fan/amateur GM and all of the negativity
2445 2018-06-16 17:39:26 Eh, No it doesn't.  It does however accurately state that for an Independent Scotland to achieve the same level of wealth as Norway's £1.7Trillion Oil Fund, it would take between 20 & 25 years. Nowhere in the report does it say Scotland will be any worse off than in the Union
2446 2018-06-16 17:39:23 I have synthetic oil but thanks
2447 2018-06-16 17:39:21 A large minority of Americans are still like this now & yearn for a return to those days of the late 18th Century/early 19th Century. We never would have elected a snake oil salesman President if that side of our nature was not still present.

2448 2018-06-16 17:39:18 I wish I could help, embarrassingly I don't currently use cannabis. I work in oil and gas, who have drug testing etc. Not worth risking my job. Agree with Beans, still seek professional advice.
2449 2018-06-16 17:39:08 As someone opined, he was not a sophisticated investor, anyone smart would not put their fortune in a sea of graft, let alone oil.
2450 2018-06-16 17:39:04 There will never be peace when you have 57 Arab nations automatically supporting the Palestinians and the Europeans beholden to Arab oil interests to satisfy their energy needs (along with what they receive from Russia), not to mention European anti-semitism.
2451 2018-06-16 17:39:01 I was beyond stoked to find Squish brand gummies sold in Edmonton because they have vegan options and are delicious but I just found out they use palm oil soooo that’s a no for me 
2452 2018-06-16 17:38:54 Again, oil is not the 'whole plant', either.

Differing mixes of THC and CBD are quite useful, tho you're right, it's just easier to grow the right mix in the first place.

But no, there's no 'multi-trillion-dollar' pharma industry around making patent pills.  Yet.  Legalize!
2453 2018-06-16 17:38:53 grab the oil.
2454 2018-06-16 17:38:44 Omfg where can i get an oil change real quick
2455 2018-06-16 17:38:24 What happens when the global energy industry is radically transformed, and oil becomes just another commodity?
2456 2018-06-16 17:38:22 I hate snake oil salesman like ict with a passion man.
2457 2018-06-16 17:38:17 soooo basically in this 2018 there is no primer in this world that can stop these pores oozing fucking oil
2458 2018-06-16 17:38:03 chilla really adding oil to the fire if he gets dreads too i'm going to scream
2459 2018-06-16 17:37:57 don’t look like my oil getting changed either  baby loook here
2460 2018-06-16 17:37:53 It will recovered by next year after @TullowOilplc and @Governmentofkenya collude for early oil piloting scheme for the sake of these debt without having proper legislative framework

2463 2018-06-16 17:37:45 snake oil shite
2464 2018-06-16 17:37:40 Your supporters are the same as those they descended from. The fools that bought snake oil from every travelling salesman that road into town.

Nothing but opium in a bottle. It didnt cure shit but after taking it you just didnt care anymore.
2465 2018-06-16 17:37:14 Weather is getting warm and it's only getting hotter, time to get out on your new or used PWC and hit the water and cool off.  Stop in and pick up your oil, spark plugs, and spare tethers.
2466 2018-06-16 17:37:09 So much hikmah
2467 2018-06-16 17:36:55 If u open Popeyes chicken you see a cup full of oil run out. I don’t see that in kfc chicken. It also has a weird taste

2469 2018-06-16 17:36:17 If Alaska were in the Nat Gas business today the state would be losing over 2 mil$ every day!!! If there was a dime in it then the oil companies would have been in it along time ago! #AKLNG scam

2472 2018-06-16 17:35:56 thanks! she’s been through a lot. i’ve been using s farsalli oil on my face every night and it has a retinol in it which is really been doin good things for me!
2473 2018-06-16 17:35:55 Sad, sad little man.....it's eating you alive that your influence continues to slip away. This us what draining the swamp looks like.  The oil industry is hiring.....maybe it's time for you to get a real job. Although,  training really stupid lazy employees is really expensive.
2474 2018-06-16 17:35:38 Fuck's sake my oil filter was so tight it broke my oil filter wrench.
2475 2018-06-16 17:35:38 @TouchedbyLnr packing today for next week and have a Q regarding the classes. Do we bring our own oils? Aka coconut oil? 
2476 2018-06-16 17:35:36 And here, again, IMO the West is being naive. EVs will benefit China but not necessarily other countries. China has relatively little oil reserves so it is in their best interests to move away from it.
2477 2018-06-16 17:35:29 Yep. Next up, holocaust deniers & people who believe cancer can be cured with lavender oil, presumably
2478 2018-06-16 17:35:24 True they co2 extract CBD. The whole plant works best. Cannabis oil is easy to get. If you know a weed dealer chances are he knows a guy but at £50 a gram its expensive. If it was legalized ppl would grow it themselves & the multi trillion $ industry could lose 50% profit in 2yrs
2479 2018-06-16 17:35:09 Why did I ever stop using coconut oil on my face that was stupid my skin looks amazing
2480 2018-06-16 17:35:06 The 2018 budget was based on $46/bbl oil & called for a deficit, which explains the small allocation for reconstruction. 

This article updates data & argues that there are plenty of funds for reconstruction. 

The risk, It notes, is both just “current” spending & corruption

2489 2018-06-16 17:33:04 Apparently only a select group wants oil to be an economic catalyst
2490 2018-06-16 17:32:51 Amen I totally understand how you feel..Tennessee is weird about outsiders from far off lands .. they have a mentality that we / people need governed like slave days  they haven’t lost that part of their dna footprintflush that w hemp oil in cellular split #PlantScience

2492 2018-06-16 17:32:46 In my research into keto i learned about butter coffee. Sounded gross but I thought i would try it since i had coffee, butter, and mct oil. Did a low amount of both mct and butter but OMG so good! Everyday im discovering better ways!
2493 2018-06-16 17:32:45 I’m not into the Devil’s Island or Bubba punishment fantasies. For me it’s enough that he lost his liberty, it’s a fair punishment and will be the oil on his rusted tin man jaw.

2499 2018-06-16 17:31:50 To remove the sour taste in your blended/grinded tomatoes+pepper. Simply add potash(koun) of normal size while boiling and salt.
Want your moi moi to come out of the pan easily like pop? Simply grease your bowls or tin with palm oil or g/but oil.

2502 2018-06-16 17:31:31 You havent seen that before? Theres also Avocado oil spray and avocado oil fried chips.

Its actually useful since it can get hotter before smoking.
2503 2018-06-16 17:31:21 Did an oil change on my car  car is healthy
2504 2018-06-16 17:30:44 Better than tea tree oil?

2506 2018-06-16 17:30:20 @sajidjavid  re cannabis oil given to epileptic boy I agree he needs & should have but what about people with #chronic pain ie #c.r.ps #ms #fybromyalgia or other conditions?  it is well known it helps but yet they are not given this even when they're a no further medications
2507 2018-06-16 17:30:18 Over sabi, who tell you say Na everyone de use oil to roast
2508 2018-06-16 17:30:10 During oil pulling plaque building bacteria responsible for dental caries, gingivitis, periodontitis and bad breath are removed from the oral cavity. Gums become pink, healthier, and problem of bleeding gums is solved.
2509 2018-06-16 17:30:09 I slow roast carrots and parsnips in olive oil and wild honey. Takes 2 hours. And I get shit for being a ponce about food from people who think boiling them for 20 minutes is somehow better because it's faster. But they taste of nothing! Nothing but water and despair.
2510 2018-06-16 17:30:06 While the rest of the world works towards biodiversity, green energy, artificial intelligence...etc. DUMP has us researching how to return to 1850s mining work, opening our coastal areas to dirty old oil and picking up oil disasters after fracking!!
2511 2018-06-16 17:29:59 I'll stick with the oil burner!
2512 2018-06-16 17:29:55 It has it pros and cons, look @ what happened w/ standard oil when broke it up? Rock got richer, ie more dangerous. Need #IBOR https ://twitter.com/offgridmedia/status/1008038309438910464?s=12
2513 2018-06-16 17:29:50 Put fish oil on their tummies. They will be too focused trying to lick it off they wont fight you. You can sit them in the water and wash their back. Wash their tummies last.
2514 2018-06-16 17:29:36 I have seen cannabis oil for sale in many high street health shops recently. I am confused. How come itcan be sold in shops if it’s not legal?
2515 2018-06-16 17:29:29 Libs and Cons r atheist pigs who just want our land water and sky to poison it for their profit. They dont care if we die.
Oil is killer. it is killing planet. Its time we got off oil. Short term palty profit for long term ecological disaster does not spell healthy change to me.X

2520 2018-06-16 17:27:45 Norway has saved huge $$$$ from their oil industry instead of fritting it away like Canada. Norwegians have a great education system and people spend time in their military. Good model. One Canada should follow.
2521 2018-06-16 17:27:40 Watched the news and heard the most stupid thing. A man said he hates the gas prices but there is nothing he can do. You can share ride, public transportation and boycott certain gas stations such as7/11, town pump etc. Why won't that stop big oil that Trump endorses?
2522 2018-06-16 17:27:39 so wash him in dawn soap to get them all off then after.. soak a bandana in water with some drops of tea tree oil and wrap it around his neck. not soaked tho, just damp.

2524 2018-06-16 17:27:19 Putin wants to sell us his oil. It is so obvious who, what and why is in control. This country is morally corrupt.
2525 2018-06-16 17:27:19 Checked my oil and the air in my tires today. Get you a girl who can do the things you can’t.
2526 2018-06-16 17:27:17 WHY BUY A TIP SHEET?
Tip sheets like my "Shore Shots by Jersey Jorge" are usually written by EXPERT HANDICAPPERS, like me  who have a reputation for picking winners.   Race tracks will not allow untalented tipsters to sell their patrons 'snake oil!

2529 2018-06-16 17:27:00 @narendramodi in his second term, since trump won’t be re-elected again will make sure oil goes up so much sorry to say it but India will be on its knees. It’s time to be proactive and don’t wait for things to happen.

2532 2018-06-16 17:26:08 All my baby need in her hair is coconut oil and Jamaican black castor oil. I don’t use anything else, that’s all she need and her shea moisture baby shampoo.
2533 2018-06-16 17:26:01 Not sure that's how it works.
Venezuela has oil, and 1 Venezuelan Bolívar = 0.000010 USD.
Russia has oil, and 1 Russian Ruble =
0.016 USD.
Want more examples?
2534 2018-06-16 17:25:56 There's another one in one of the oil marketing companies...a lady member of BJP minority cell...
2535 2018-06-16 17:25:51 Try rosehip oil, vitamin E oil, cocoa butter or chemical exfoliants (lactic acid works best for me but a lot of people love pixi glow tonic)
2536 2018-06-16 17:25:50 Fresh is gonna give you a lot better flavor. If you do buy mined, get in oil not water. You can use the oil from that in your food too
2537 2018-06-16 17:25:42 “It’s sugar, flour, eggs, oil, and water.” He didn’t get the memo about confectioners’ sugar and used course grain instead, as well as having mixed it poorly.

2539 2018-06-16 17:25:17 @narendramodi Trump’s master stroke on oil,we should be vary off. If he is elected again India’s problems will be of plenty. By keeping up oil, he has helped Russia and not only saved jobs but infact created more in USA. They are now worlds largest producer as well of oil.

2548 2018-06-16 17:24:24 You do realize that NAFTA is the only reason Canada is require to supply the USA with oil right? That’s currently 41% of all US consumption — be careful what you wish. As for steel — you are also ignorant here. Canada is a net importer of US steel.
2549 2018-06-16 17:23:58 Revisiting PH Frankel's classic "Essentials of Petroleum" is an eye-opener. It's a spare, clear sketch of the structural problems of competition and cartel the #oil industry has always faced. Belongs on every oil and gas fan's bookshelf.
2550 2018-06-16 17:23:44 No you idiot, this is the OIL that people are taking, you do not smoke it, u rub it on your gums, take it orally. Yes obviously people smoke cannabis, but this article and many other articles are focusing on the treatment by cannabis oil.
2551 2018-06-16 17:23:42 @WestburyToyota1 car is saying I need service at the 8532 miles. Just had an inspection and oil change in March. Could this be the mileage that was programmed in for the oil change before that?

Nunes is from California’s Central Valley, which can be thought of a mash-up of Texas and Oklahoma because of Agri and oil. A massive get out the vote is needed for the area. Please tell National Dems. Thank you

2555 2018-06-16 17:23:23 I'm struggling to find the legal status of true cannabis oil too (writing a policy about vaping in hospital). Some reference to the oil being a Class A rather than class B! 

Not over for this boy either - license allows acute use in hospital from what I understand.
2556 2018-06-16 17:23:15 Hmm, I doubt more paper than normal but I'll look closer at the cuticle oil. And try to retrace what else. My only other thought is this nail polish but I've used Sally Hansen before 
2557 2018-06-16 17:23:11 I understand that with coconut or Olive oil because it makes sense to shampoo those out but I feel like putting ready-to-use-products from the store before shampoo is a waste of product, I don't know it just doesn't add up to me
2558 2018-06-16 17:23:07 Delighted to hear that Billy Caldwell has had his cannabis oil returned. A totally needless situation that could have been avoided.

2570 2018-06-16 17:21:16 I think the license allows the hospital to administer it acutely, not use it long term. For those questioning the legality of "cannabis oil" in the UK:

1) hemp oil - legal, no THC or CBD
2) CBD oil - legal if just CBD 
3) Cannabis oil - potentially considered class A!

2624 2018-06-16 17:12:40 Invariably, an economy so oil dependently maligned is bound to struggle in time of price fall for lack of savings & looting.
Perhaps, when the oil prices are up, the windfall goes siphoned by upperclassmen, stifling flow to make appreciable decrease in poverty levels of Nigerians

2635 2018-06-16 17:11:14 The MRP was more than a non aggression pact, it was an alliance.  Hitler and Stalin colluded in the occupation of Poland and the USSR supplied the Wehrmacht with oil right up until Operation Barbarossa began.  Operation Pike was a plan to disrupt Hitler's fuel supply.

Btw, Manusmriti itself says it can be changed.
What about Bible and Koran?
2645 2018-06-16 17:09:53 Take a look at CRB index ... Each bounce on the inflationary phase is weaker due to larger debt, so inflation is killing markets faster. No way oil can reach > 100$ as it will crash everything in a moment, so each time deflation is harder/stronger.

2662 2018-06-16 17:06:55 I once had an experience in a Social Services Meeting, Tory Councillor's, thought nuclear family when mentioned,  referred to Nuclear Arms. I think that explains what we are up against, when using terms like Oil of Marujana, Tory's have a no capacity of understanding anything? !
2663 2018-06-16 17:06:53 The upsetting story of #BillyCaldwell is just one of so many. The lack of prescribed cannabis oil for people who need it is nothing short of an abuse of the most vulnerable people in our society. Huge respect to those campaigning for change.
2664 2018-06-16 17:06:50 Ozil Oil is arsenal best player ...you know give him pk for crucial match to score.. 
If not you're mad
2665 2018-06-16 17:06:46 But snake oil salesman Eddie will say the Baabaas match was fake news! 
2666 2018-06-16 17:06:41 the one in the blue container with flax oil is! I believe that’s the only one
2667 2018-06-16 17:06:35 Received! Next time I'll have all the spray and oil and candles

2669 2018-06-16 17:06:21 Some background here : Stavenger is a small far-way town, and the oil capital of super-oil rich Norway. Guys there have nothing to do except work and buy expensive stuff. The standard of living is so high a Tesla over there is actually cheap ; #GoldenGoose
2670 2018-06-16 17:06:07 Yes, we can. Burning hydrogen generates water.

Note that burning carbon fuel also generates water, and quite a bit of it.
Carbon fuel (oil) is carbon-hydrates and burns to CO2 and water.
2671 2018-06-16 17:06:05 A lot of truth here. Depends whether he is contrite or is a total vs partial asshole, maybe. Craig McT spent a year in jail for a DUI crash that killed a woman. He stood up for his fatal mistake. Oil and NHL forgave. Would that happen now?

2673 2018-06-16 17:05:49 my boss was telling me about some no sugar, no oil, so salt (or well added?) and I was gagging on the inside. he said he it was hard but he felt good after it. you never know. maybe ill try it
2674 2018-06-16 17:05:45 Apologies. Just tried creative market PS RM georgous oil and they ARE laggy under iOS
2675 2018-06-16 17:05:43 @FollowMFJ Think this has been resolved @SajidJavid relented & Billy got permission to use cannabis oil. Still leaves problem of why it isn't available on prescription for those who need it. But sense finally prevailed earlier today in this case.
2676 2018-06-16 17:05:42 Today I discovered you can make a cornbread-like baked good using chickpea flour, canned pumpkin, and olive oil with a little cumin.
2677 2018-06-16 17:05:41 How many years of oil reserves are left in the world? I hope they can create an all electric jet engine before the reserves run out...the last nation that can move its military wins. We are ready to open ANWR that was a strategic reserve. Russia has vast oil reserves an we don't!
2678 2018-06-16 17:05:27 Note to self: if the oil doesn't even touch the dipstick, you screwed up terribly
2679 2018-06-16 17:05:09 If true, show us the links. 

And tell us, please, how did socialism tank the price of Venezuelan oil? Isn’t that a world market function beyond the control of one tinpot dictator?
2680 2018-06-16 17:05:04 I'm SO glad the mother has been allowed back the CBD cannabis oil for her young son's epilepsy- i've been following the story and it was appalling his treatment had been denied by our government.
2681 2018-06-16 17:04:57 วันจันไม่ต้องสงสัยว่าทำไมกูไม่ไปเรียน กูจะไปเป็นลิเก
2682 2018-06-16 17:04:54 The benefits certainly outweigh what the big pharmaceutical companies are giving people end of!. It's not rocket science Ranj. Anyway I'm glad the boy is able to receive his oil. It doesn't excuse the governments draconian view on the matter.
2683 2018-06-16 17:04:48 coba pake bio oil
2684 2018-06-16 17:04:48 Now that I'm done working, gonna be busy af

2686 2018-06-16 17:04:44 I’m surprised more people aren’t talking about this—this is exactly what I think too. That’s why he wants to drill off the entire coastline—he’s going to give this contracts to Russian oil cos and pocket the $$$$ in kickbacks. #corruption
2687 2018-06-16 17:04:22 Congrats on getting cannabis oil back. Fuck socialized medicine.
2688 2018-06-16 17:04:18 Stuffed peppers and tomatoes also work. I also love grilled peppers macerated in olive oil, needs some advance prep.
2689 2018-06-16 17:04:01 How often do I have to get my oil changed? Please say it's every 27,468 miles
2690 2018-06-16 17:03:53 I've been suck in Oil Ocean for so fucking long that level can kma

2692 2018-06-16 17:03:37 I almost got engaged at the age of 17 , yet I still don’t know how to ask for an oil change
2693 2018-06-16 17:03:36 I typically tend to use a cream but during the summer months and especially if I'm going to be out in the heat I'll use jojoba oil.
2694 2018-06-16 17:03:31 Literally: to sell oil
2695 2018-06-16 17:03:28 At last. People are realizing that there’s something fishy about the activism against the prod’n & export of  oil.  The writing has been on the wall for a decade. Feels like it’s finally starting to sink in. #Onwards

2700 2018-06-16 17:02:04 Catching up on shows. The Red Circle in Riverdale is super homoerotic. These guys all gather put on some red hoods, strip shirtless and oil up to make a threatening video.
2701 2018-06-16 17:02:02 All my Caucasian friends complaining how they’re gonna burn. I said I don’t know that pain I literally brought tanning oil to the beach

2703 2018-06-16 17:01:43 Are these children part of those that will contribute to national development in the future? A nation where #children are educated is a winning nation. As a matter of urgency, #Nigeria must salvage this ugly situation because education is most valuable resource, not crude oil.
2704 2018-06-16 17:01:39 You know it’s going to be a great day when oil is your chaser
2705 2018-06-16 17:01:36 What else is in that cuticle oil? If there's any acid, that might be it. Also, if you're handling books/paper a lot. The chemicals used for production did that to my fingers when I was a bookseller and a co-worker of mine had to wear rubber gloves.
2706 2018-06-16 17:01:24 The salesman just execute the idea that was created by the marketing team.....hence y I say the salesman is just the engine oil of the engine seal but the marketing team is the ENGINE of the organization's product, services, experience etc
2707 2018-06-16 17:01:19 Now, as I watch the sunrise.
Ah, the smell of oil, the morning light.
There's but one shadow cast on the asphalt.
2708 2018-06-16 17:01:18 Yesss. Pre-heat the oil always.
2709 2018-06-16 17:01:10 Meanwhile this poor child is suffering, as are his family watching him. Give the child his cannabis oil. End of deliberation!
2710 2018-06-16 17:01:06 I'd forgotten that working a bigger dog is like manoeuvring an oil tanker. #justsaying
2711 2018-06-16 17:00:56 @RepGosar wants to penalize states who chose to protect their lands and waters. Public lands are for the people, not oil companies. #ourwild

2713 2018-06-16 17:00:43 The question, what if Canada had backed wind energy instead of the oil sands? AB's electricity supply'd be far different. Still, today we'll have cleaner urban air, less air poll mortality, illness & GHGs in AB with electric cars vs gas/diesel ones. Wind'll grow, coal'll go.
2714 2018-06-16 17:00:42 They are incapable of critical thought so they follow a snake oil salesmen and buy everything that the conman says. I understand how email scams work now.
2715 2018-06-16 17:00:42 My longest lived goldfish was a $1 carnival buy. 8 years. And only died because of a blizzard cutting out power for a week...I actually euthanized it with clove oil. It can be done :)
2716 2018-06-16 17:00:34 On June 16, 1892, the Edmonton Bulletin reported an indication of oil in Alberta.

2718 2018-06-16 17:00:25 Who wants to pay for my oil change tho it’s only 100
2719 2018-06-16 17:00:15 06/16: Crushed tomato, red onion, mozzarella & Dunbarton blue cheese; garnished with garlic olive oil, parsley & oregano
2720 2018-06-16 17:00:04 Wash my face with clean & clear, use Dermol cream to moisturise, wait for it to sink into my skin and then add a layer of oil olive - idk if it’ll work for you but it does for my skin type which is extremely dry

2722 2018-06-16 17:00:02 Came to the dealership for my first oil change and while in line, a salesman comes up and tries to get me to sell my car back. No lies... In tempted to get back into a lease... #unexpectedSaturday
2723 2018-06-16 17:00:02 Attacks in an area that #الهلال_النفطي led to the combustion of an oil reservoir belonging to the Al-Harog company, and the damage was severe.
2724 2018-06-16 17:00:01 Oil change is complete.

2726 2018-06-16 16:59:56 Make no mistake, oil runs our world. Many have profited because of it, many have died because of it. The Saudis will deal with anyone who will help their business. Putin is taking advantage. @politacs7 #Oil #Saudis
2727 2018-06-16 16:59:43 I’m the type of person if I ever loved you then it’s really hard for me to let you go. Ion love easily at oil .
2728 2018-06-16 16:59:26 Having seen how Don Con-un works it is somewhat more difficult than this.  Trumpski has been a grifter his whole life. He has many scams going at once and chose the most abhorrent as a cover-up to other nefarious affairs.  He is not only a snake oil salesman, he is a snake!
2729 2018-06-16 16:59:20 You're talking of oil prices? Really?! How much was it 5/6 years ago?
2730 2018-06-16 16:59:08 Cutting down these forest also speeds up climate change. Less trees and release of natural gases. So it’s a counter productive point. You can’t compare death by volcano, to death by wanting palm oil for chocolate/lipstick/plastic etc.your attitude would literally fuck this planet
2731 2018-06-16 16:58:54 I don’t workout

2735 2018-06-16 16:58:17 Actually that's the forces of capitalism. --Wall Street, IMF, US trade policy, US oil policy that purposely plunged oil prices etc.
2736 2018-06-16 16:58:12 I put coconut oil on the booty for flavor
2737 2018-06-16 16:57:44 Bio oil
2738 2018-06-16 16:57:43 Could you tell me where there is more info on oil patterns and what all that stuff means, genuinely interested. Thanks
2739 2018-06-16 16:57:32 Heh almost. The fryer oil still has the taste from the fried green Szechuan peppers so the fried duck skin has a nice hit of mala.
2740 2018-06-16 16:57:05 On a scale of zero to anointing our backyard swingset with oil, how Pentacostal am I?
2741 2018-06-16 16:57:03 Got to love the EU Egypt has raised gasoline prices by up to 50 percent, the oil ministry said on Saturday, under an IMF reform plan calling for tough austerity measures that have made life harder for ordinary Egyptians.

For subsidies in the 2018-19 EU state budget.
2742 2018-06-16 16:56:46 I met a 45 yr. Old restaurateur this past week. Fabulous wealth had no bearing on the 3 inch tumor in his brain. Lopped a hole in his skull and removed the invader. Usual treatment of chemo cycles. THAT WAS KILLING HIM.
Long story, quit chemo, now on OIL and smoke. Great results!
2743 2018-06-16 16:56:41 I need to go get my oil changed but it's so fucking hot outside

2746 2018-06-16 16:56:32 Of concern is the mother’s dual claims that the THC-free oil has no effect, and that the levels of THC in the oil she does claim works are too low to be of effect. I’m unclear how both things can be true.
2747 2018-06-16 16:56:30 We could only learn from our mistakes! So let's get all on the same wavelength, change the oil dependency .....or we will never leave the oil fields..........To much profit......

2754 2018-06-16 16:55:51 Trump is a jack ass but so is Hilary. The 2 party system is an illusion. Elite business families i.e.the Bildenberg group members run the USA. Bildenberg guys own fed reserve, IRS, banks, oil firms, media, pharma, tech, defence and more
2755 2018-06-16 16:55:49 Like the like oil stocks in 2015. I did quite well on those. Could have been better with a little more courage!

2758 2018-06-16 16:55:23 Absolutely.  I’ve known many people this would/will help.  Should be the catalyst for change.  Doctors can prescribe morphine but not cannabis oil.  Come on.

2764 2018-06-16 16:54:16 Idk about this 20k oil change interval.  I changed it at 15K and I notice  a big difference @Mobil1
2765 2018-06-16 16:54:12 Y’all. I just found three bottles of @Wegmans sub oil in a box when I first moved to Memphis in 2016 . How could I waste liquid gold like that?!?

2769 2018-06-16 16:53:44 OK where do you girls get sunflowers to put in your hair? 
I've only seen a sunflower on the cooking oil tins

2771 2018-06-16 16:53:30 MASSAGE YOUR EYELIDS CONTINUED
•Put a few drops of oil, petroleum jelly or shea butter on your eyelids. Using your fingertips, massage along your lids and lash line in small, circular motions. Massage for 5 to 7 minutes twice daily for a few months.
2772 2018-06-16 16:53:18 Don't want to see it on sale at the local newsagents, but I'm quite open to qualified doctors prescribing it to suffering patients. The cannabis oil bought in Canada was manufactured in Norfolk, so why are we selling it to other medical organisations, but banning our own??
2773 2018-06-16 16:53:15 Why are so many immigrating? American interference policies in South America and the Middle East cause war and poverty for oil. The oil is not the goal; the goal is making the rich oligarchs richer.
If you're going to destabalise whole countries, at least support those affected.
2774 2018-06-16 16:53:14 We live this in Brazil! Hope that your company come to our country to change this cenario! Only one oil company control our energy for transportation ! #petrobras #oil #tesla #diesel #gasolina @petrobras

2778 2018-06-16 16:52:44 i have been told that Holland and Barrett sell one too. Not sure of the quality. There are many people in UK selling CBD tincture and oil now, which is great. I had a great tincture but can't remember where I got it from which is  a shame!
2779 2018-06-16 16:52:42 We have lots of oil you can buy if you want to buy Canadian
2780 2018-06-16 16:52:40 what is the purpose of committing to responsibly sourcing palm oil by 2020 if you're not currently irresponsibly sourcing palm oil?

2785 2018-06-16 16:51:54 Home office letting that 12 year old lad have his cannabis oil back gives precident and surely shows they understand the medicinal value of it. Canada are looking into legalising cannabis in the coming months and this country should join them given the amount of income it'd bring
2786 2018-06-16 16:51:50 We worked maintenance in an oil refinery. Nobody had time to make life difficult for anyone. Everyone was expected to do their job.  It is a matter of safety when you're working on love units. One careless mistake and many suffer because of it.

2791 2018-06-16 16:51:13 Also, while cannabinoids are most probably of some therapeutic value for this kind of thing, to give a child uncontrolled doses of cannabis oil consisting of unknown quantities of cannabinoids and other compounds is staggeringly unethical and quite possibly dangerous
2792 2018-06-16 16:51:08 They want it all hush hush so that others don't start applying for a license....look at Charlotte Caldwell and Billy the HO have given back the oil...wouldn't look good if something serious happened

2797 2018-06-16 16:50:25 @Pelico I am not saying sales is not important but if you read my tweet I will stand by it because sales is just the engine oil of the engine bt question do you know that a product can be sold without a sales representative going out to sell it. It's not abt text book knowledge.
2798 2018-06-16 16:50:18 $100 for an oil change.  How annoying,  I'm about to learn how to do this shit.
2799 2018-06-16 16:50:06 40 bucks for synthetic oil. Oh M Gee
2800 2018-06-16 16:49:53 Oil is your goat?   
2801 2018-06-16 16:49:49 Curious your thoughts on ibogaine for opiod addiction? It might work great but it seems like these retreats in Mexico & Caribbean are snake oil salesman claiming its a magic cure-all & they are targeting middle class parents who are willing to try anything to get there kid's help
2802 2018-06-16 16:49:34 a cucumber soaked in vinegar and oil would make me feel so much better rn
2803 2018-06-16 16:49:34 #Adulting is keeping your Saturday AM oil change appointment at the dealership after a late-running drag show ... Thank lort they provide free coffee. Cool down so I can drink you, thx!
2804 2018-06-16 16:49:31 I'll pay someone to get my oil changed I don't feel like leaving my house
2805 2018-06-16 16:49:29 My mom: [walks into the compound] Why is there canola oil all over the kitchen floor
Me:
My mom: Thought so [walks out of the compound]
2806 2018-06-16 16:49:25 OLIVE OIL
• Dip a clean, old mascara stick or simply a cotton swab in warm olive oil. Before going to bed, apply the oil carefully on your lashes, just as you would apply mascara. Leave it on overnight, then wash it off with lukewarm water in the morning. Repeat this remedy
2807 2018-06-16 16:49:17 News & others said Pipe Line were not Safe or constructed properly for years. Welds were not done properly & failed Xrays. Pipelines for Canadian crude oil from shale are worse. Pipeline owners & you did not care. Now Americans & earth is paying the price.
2808 2018-06-16 16:49:15 Oil change & Beach with my Abuser  Patron Henny & Gudtree  cause we rockstars  #anditsfathersdayweekend
2809 2018-06-16 16:49:15 ダイエットしていたって、時にはオイルも必要だろう?
2810 2018-06-16 16:49:13 Ironic? If you looked into his childhood, you'd see this more as retaliation/retribution towards the men + father figures in his life.
He blames oil for dad's + grandpa's wickedness of child rearing.
Ever watch JT's eulogy for his dad?
Or googled Dr John Seeley + Pierre Trudeau?
2811 2018-06-16 16:49:10 This is why cannabis oil isn’t available here @AndrewCastle63
2812 2018-06-16 16:48:59 You think rice production and oil production are the same thing?

Why would we not want to be exporters of petroleum products?

Where is the investment money, expertise and power supply?
2813 2018-06-16 16:48:55 Wonderful news. Billy Caldwell has his cannabis oil returned. Now then, about the rest us who have direct experience of it's positive effects on our chronic conditions? As Mark E Smith declaimed "what about us?"
2814 2018-06-16 16:48:35 America deserves better - we can take back our country from this snake oil salesmen #TrumpSwamp #votethemout2018
2815 2018-06-16 16:48:30 I was pose to go get my oil changed this morning
2816 2018-06-16 16:48:19 crazyyy ....maybe ur land has potential for oil production
2817 2018-06-16 16:48:15 I just had hot oil  pop into my face 
2818 2018-06-16 16:48:15 So the indian restaurant is in flames.... area contains 16 tons of LPG, an Oil store and a paint store... it appears that all fire appliances on the West Coast within 100 kms are being deployed.
2819 2018-06-16 16:48:11 The oil price is being manipulated!

2821 2018-06-16 16:48:08 African black soap and the korres wild rose brightening oil from Sephora. A lil pricey but it 100% works
2822 2018-06-16 16:48:05 But ONGC is being made a scapegoat to share the subsidy burden when the oil prices are high..... And they are obviously not going to do well when oil prices are low.....
2823 2018-06-16 16:48:01 Yeahhhh, I had an allergic reaction to it, face blew up to double the size! Currently trying to work with tea tree oil 
2824 2018-06-16 16:47:59 I gave mine some beard oil ^^ Hoping he might take some time for a bit of self care

2826 2018-06-16 16:47:30 Yes! using enough oil and making sure the skillet is hot when you drop the batter in. Babysitting has given me plenty of pancake practice.
2827 2018-06-16 16:47:29 CASTOR OIL
• The powerful follicle-stimulating and nourishing castor oil can help you enjoy lustrous and voluminous lashes. It also helps fight micro-organisms that hamper growth.
2828 2018-06-16 16:47:13 Just placed my very first order on monq I got so excited I bought 7 blends  if you didn’t know monq are personal essential oil diffusers and are 100% safe! Nicotine & tobacco free! You can order yours from @myMONQ!
2829 2018-06-16 16:47:01 Like The Shaw of Iran. America looked over what he was doing 2his ppl 4 oil. Why they hate us today. Same w Philippines. Look over what kim is doing 2 his ppl bc America 1st. The ppl will hate us there2. Don't say ur doing it 4 me. I wldn't have  it. Sld have ask us first 
2830 2018-06-16 16:46:58 Pepermint oil literally helps everything!
2831 2018-06-16 16:46:45 Epidolox is only about between 50% & 63% reduction in seizures and you are right epidolox isn't that good but it's a gateway to legalization if Billy can get epidolox it opens up legalization and then all children can get it. Ppl need to see cannabis oil work to believe it.
2832 2018-06-16 16:46:39 lovely :) Is this acrylic or oil?
2833 2018-06-16 16:46:36 - Castor Oil

- Brush your eyelashes
- Eyelid massage

2837 2018-06-16 16:46:02 So are you against the wealthy? That’s fine we’ll just have socialism and no freedom. With oil and banking you are comparing 2 completely different industries is the allowance reasonable not really but the company also has all the risk if they fail. Now if we are giving land away
2838 2018-06-16 16:45:58 Oil .......Water?
2839 2018-06-16 16:45:47 Today I got an oil change all by myself and was called “sir” by the guy working on it so I think I deserve an iced coffee™
2840 2018-06-16 16:45:46 #ukog HH-1 flow tested at a significant commercial aggregate stable dry oil rate of 1,688 barrels of oil per day from the Portland, KL3/ KL4 reservoir horizons. Over the 30-90 hour flow periods from each of the 3 zones, no clear indication of any reservoir pressure depletion.
2841 2018-06-16 16:45:36 Check your Transmission oil today.
2842 2018-06-16 16:45:18 Of course any plant based is better than dairy. Unless the organic is completely changed from the original canola, I'm not buying it. Canola name came from Canada Oil. This was a man made oil. I prefer eating raw avocado, nuts, seeds, algae.
2843 2018-06-16 16:45:13 Awesome, keep up the good work 
2844 2018-06-16 16:45:13 milk cleanser sama cleansing oil itu step pertama, sama kaya micellar. pilih salah satu aja. nah serum essence biasanya abis toner
2845 2018-06-16 16:45:07 Yes, but have you tried coconut oil and a dash of cinnamon?
2846 2018-06-16 16:44:58 My oil change for my car went from $60 to $140  bcuz they found shit that needed to be replaced lmao. 
2847 2018-06-16 16:44:51 Hard guy hard guy but your afraid of palm oil coming close to you!
2848 2018-06-16 16:44:41 「すぐに一般に評価されるようなおもしろさ」を考え始めた時点で京大のおもしろさはオワコン感。
人目気にせず、じめじめヒソヒソ熱心にした結果、たまたま奇跡的に、一般にウケたくらいのおもしろさが、見てて一番爽快でホントに面白い気がする。
2849 2018-06-16 16:44:40 Your government just bankrolled an oil pipeline.  A bit of the pot calling the kettle black, no?
2850 2018-06-16 16:44:38 Bio oil ini sungguh membantuku dalam urusan perjerawatan, tapi tak membantuku untuk bekas luka kecelakaan yang sudah jadi keloid ini
2851 2018-06-16 16:44:38 I used to always have lavender essential oil on me and when I would feel anxious in public, I would put it on my wrists and it helped me a lot bc it’s a very calming scent!
2852 2018-06-16 16:44:34 830 am ET fall in silver and oil was a move that happens once a quarter. I woke up at 930, missed it. You must have discipline in this business. I don't yet have that but getting there.

2854 2018-06-16 16:44:29 aku sih karena baru 17 dan mukanya gak kenapa napa cuma pake micellar - facewash - toner - moist - sunscreen.

tapi kamu boleh tambahin milk cleanser, cleansing oil, serum essence (khusus serum essence umur 20 keatas)

2856 2018-06-16 16:44:20 It was primarily Cheney whispering in Bush's ear like Rasputin.  That dude is evil and he wanted the oil in Iraq for Haliburton.
2857 2018-06-16 16:44:08 Sebaiknya kamu bilang tipe kulit kamu dan umurmu berapa biar yg ngasih tau sekiranya kulitnya itu mirip kayak kamuu

Intinya kalo skincare yg wajib harga mati itu ya pembersih muka entah mau bentuknya gel, foam, oil apapun itu

2860 2018-06-16 16:43:55 Oh come on… Actors are very educated and intelligent. They know everything about farming and oil and health concerns… Just ask them they will tell you.

2862 2018-06-16 16:43:45 and growing economies/countries need consistent supply of oil to go about their day-to-day. anyway let’s see what I can whip up lol
2863 2018-06-16 16:43:43 Beautiful, Eid Mubarak gorgeous 
2864 2018-06-16 16:43:42 I just dropped a full bottle of olive oil directly on my foot RIP
2865 2018-06-16 16:43:24 1 cup oil
1/2 cup unflavored plant milk
2 tsp apple cider vinegar
salt to taste
Blend
2866 2018-06-16 16:43:21 I don’t the buying is significant to the parable, though I agree we can’t buy the Holy Spirit. I think what’s significant is the the reason why they didn’t bring enough oil to last all night. I believe it refers to apostasy with a foundation of false eschatology.
2867 2018-06-16 16:43:05 While I'm fucking pumped about being able to waltz into a store and buy edibles/oil/etc it just makes me sad because this stuff can help so many people and it's so inaccessible back home

2871 2018-06-16 16:41:47 Went from getting a cheap oil change and emissions & safety test to you need two new tires that will now be $215 + $50 and was denied getting a credit card bc I’m a broke young adult in college, all in the matter of 20 mins. Adulting sucks asss #justwannaraisemycreditscore

2873 2018-06-16 16:41:41 Get some Hawaiian silky braid spray and apply that to the roots and massage it through. I like using that when so have my braids instead of heavy oils. You can apply oil sheen to the actual braids to keep them shiny. ALWAYS keep your hair tied up at night.
2874 2018-06-16 16:41:30 Been listening most of the day. Made me feel angry come the UK  Let’s get up to date with this cannabis oil NOW

2884 2018-06-16 16:40:03 Jorge Sampaoli has not been given the extreme wealth of an oil rich nation to apply the same touch of genius.
2885 2018-06-16 16:40:02 To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it
2886 2018-06-16 16:39:28 Yes, it absolutely is. Canada is a primary industry nation, and will remain so for the foreseeable future. No one should argue we need to diversify, but that doesn’t change reality.  Canada employs 100’s of thousands of miners, loggers and oil workers, they are the middle class.
2887 2018-06-16 16:39:20 I reciprocate. Stop buying canadian.  1,2,3,4 I declare trade war. Happy now?  Disincentivize  all Cars made in Canada, then give builders incentive $ for using American lumber; we now can use our own oil, so that’s good, oh, and we don’t need anymore alcohol. Trade wars are fun!
2888 2018-06-16 16:39:17 I see can buy otc retain. Works good? Has mineral oil which seems odd.
2889 2018-06-16 16:38:55 should i fry you in that hot oil
2890 2018-06-16 16:38:37 I found using Olive oil instead of milk on muesli juiced the calories nicely
2891 2018-06-16 16:38:21 currently getting my oil changed and theres at least 3 employees wearing Pizza Ranch shirts and idk if im at the right place
2892 2018-06-16 16:38:07 Isolate is simply the CBD compound extracted, with everything else stripped away. It looks like a pure white powder! (You can also refine it into a white slab,) 
My stomach gets upset from most tinctures, from the oil I think, which is why I tried it in the first place!
2893 2018-06-16 16:37:59 This is an outrage. I have  serious health issues but am allergic to morphine - so I get diamorphine as an alternative. That's heroin. Yet they ban cannabis oil? What's wrong with this country?
2894 2018-06-16 16:37:44 I’m a mom to a special n Ed’s lad and would challenge any decision that affected my son !!! This oil showed it helped him medically good on the mom
2895 2018-06-16 16:37:42 The Friday hourly chart of gold & silver looked no different than oil copper and soybeans friday. The commodity space dragged them down, not the other way around.
Also, idiots reading Russian written zerohedge rumors of a euro collapse. ZH has been wrong since 2010, about that.
2896 2018-06-16 16:37:41 Dawg that was literally 9 years ago during the oil crisis
2897 2018-06-16 16:36:51 The day started the same in the back jungles of the Rain Forest of Africa along the Sahara desert side nobody was helping Merkel get tothe truth behind why different rain forest had oil pipelines coming in and going out of the Sarhara Desert.  The oil companies were now in bed
2898 2018-06-16 16:36:44 Jadi sebelum trlambat lbih baik"cpet pake minyak zaitun atau bio oil
2899 2018-06-16 16:36:39 This Jamaican castor oil got my beard looking luxurious today
2900 2018-06-16 16:36:32 Getting an oil change, and the guy asks if it’s been awhile...you are looking at the dipstick bud, we both know it’s been a looooooooong time.
2901 2018-06-16 16:36:28 That was just one of the studies they reported (Greenwood and Winocur). Rats fed soy oil actually did much better than those fed lard: “Rats on the lard-based diet performed the worst on all three of these tasks, revealing damaging effects of this type of diet on the brain”
2902 2018-06-16 16:36:26 Negotiate. And negotiations took place and diplomatic relations restored and agreements on fisheries and oil exploration were made. As BK Moon said in 2013, 'I don't think Security Council members are in breach of ANY relevant UN resolutions.'
2903 2018-06-16 16:36:22 Ada. Di perut sama lengan juga ada. Katanya sih pakai bio oil lumayan (aku belum nyobain sih)
2904 2018-06-16 16:36:21 It’s bad I know the oil, spark plugs, etc. that go in wranglers machine, but if you ask me about my car I have no clue
2905 2018-06-16 16:36:17 @Braves bullpen leaks more oil then a 70's Harley. Need to replace Sam Freeman & Peter Moylan. Bring up Phillip's & Webb from triple A. Those 2 cant be as bad as the other guys. Plus trade Mccaffery, he is missing his spots and gives up easy runs. #ChopOn

2907 2018-06-16 16:35:51 first of all, one pro tip (prolly), if you dont want to use soysauce (ketjapmanis), i suggest you to use butter or margarine instead of oil. but srysly tho, ketjapmanis is much better.
2908 2018-06-16 16:35:48 Gue di paha ada,kalo strch mark nya masih wrna merah"gitu msih bisa diilangin pake minyak zaitun atau bio oil tpi klo strch mark nya udh wrna putih udh susah bgt diilangin

2912 2018-06-16 16:34:50 Stereotypes about women that I’m not helping: I went to get my oil changed today. They asked me to pull up to the garage and pop the hood. I’m not kidding I sat there for like 3-4 minutes trying to figure out how to pop the hood of my own car before finally getting it 
2913 2018-06-16 16:34:45 If sis has oily skin even w/the best primers/setting powders/sprays it still might transfer BUT I can say Skindinavia sprays (oil control’s my fave) or Ben Nye’s Final seal are the BEST hands down. Anything Ben Nye, esp powders, is great tbh bc it’s stage makeup so it LASTS

2928 2018-06-16 16:32:38 @LBC what a necessary,  enlightening and essential program. Cbd oil subject is a long time coming debate and I'm thrilled that we have now overcome the silly taboos around such a potentially life  saving topic. Well done.

2931 2018-06-16 16:32:32 Of course he did, predictably, to trash the environment, continue climate change denial, & rec'v continuing kick backs from big oil & non-green  entities
2932 2018-06-16 16:32:29 I got a body oil version of this. It smells JUST like it.
2933 2018-06-16 16:32:24 Your own arguments are not helping you. The resources have been thoroughly wasted by Westminster despite UK being a 'rich' country. Norway has an oil fund worth billions. Here we need to have food banks.

I wouldn't give the Tories house room normally, but you Sir are an exception to the rule.
I am both delighted and surprised at your decision to intervene and grant a licence to treat little B Caldwell with Cannabis Oil.
Thank you so much for having initiative and grit

2940 2018-06-16 16:31:57 Need to go get an oil change and tires rotated
2941 2018-06-16 16:31:41 INSTRUCTIONS
In a pot over medium heat, heat oil. Add potatoes and cook for about 3 to 4 minutes or until lightly browned and tender. Remove from pan and drain on paper towels. Add carrots and cook for about 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from pan and drain on paper towels.
Remove excess
2942 2018-06-16 16:31:39 Yes. First, we need to stop the happy talk that we are not in now multiple trade wars. We are. Second, US energy was always going to be a Chinese retaliatory target. Plenty of oil, LNG, propane in world. Check out Chinese media today. War getting worse.
2943 2018-06-16 16:31:15 my baby had an Epsom salt bath and and got some coconut oil for his lil paws

2949 2018-06-16 16:30:51 Just make sure you sterilize the needles before & after every use & don't forget to moisturise after! & make sure you don't have active acne when you start bc the derma roller could spread it  Works very well for post acne scars & large pores (Tea tree oil works well for acne)

2964 2018-06-16 16:29:06 @lbc you do realise you can buy cannabis oil from Holland & Barrett
2965 2018-06-16 16:29:04 So the "invisible hand" in the healthcare "free market" is really more like a gloved pickpocket?

2975 2018-06-16 16:27:39 Guards against monopolies are absolutely needed, as monopolies can get larger than what can organically be toppled by grass roots competition. Oil corporations for example depend on access to resources. If you monopolize it there it's no way to gain access for competition.

2977 2018-06-16 16:27:28 My bf when I bought him an oil painting set-up: "It's cute that you did that to me."
2978 2018-06-16 16:27:25 Thank you. And that is why Republicans are trying to fine states who resist oil companies wanting to drill offshore near their states. They care more about business than people, our health, our environment. What's happened to our country?

2987 2018-06-16 16:26:41 one of the things I love about Rhode Island is that when you have to go run adult type errands, there’s like never a line, anywhere

2988 2018-06-16 16:26:39 not sure what you mean. USD is backed by neither gold nor oil. Insolvency? - that's true you can never be insolvent as a nation if you can print endless money. Will that help? I doubt it.

2999 2018-06-16 16:25:32 So the oil depletion allowances in the US oil industry and gifting of vast tracts of land to individuals whose descendants still wield great power, protectionism that created problems all over the world in the cotton industry for example, are state intervention that's ok?

3002 2018-06-16 16:25:24 Changing the subject won’t change reality. Canada’s biggest expt to the USA is heavy (tar sands) oil. Did you notice one of Trumps 1st priorities was to become the world’s biggest oil producer? Go ahead, see if you can pay added transportation and see if you can export that crap.
3003 2018-06-16 16:25:19 Nigel needs to go tour one of the oil rigs in the North Sea and stay there.

3010 2018-06-16 16:24:56 If global warming is the issue or a natural event then yes fair enough but when it’s palm oil use for our own use then we have to do it in a. Sustainable non damaging way.

3018 2018-06-16 16:24:29 It is important to realise that the boy's GP was prescribing him cannabis oil on a regular basis until the Department of Health changed the rules to outlaw use of the oil in the UK.    
    
Sajid Javid's decision, welcome though it is, will only make sense if rules are changed.

3030 2018-06-16 16:23:36 I genuinely don’t understand any arguments against cannabis oil medication. If it works (which it evidently does for a lot of people) then it should be allowed without question. People get unnecessarily uptight as soon as they see/hear the word cannabis

3050 2018-06-16 16:21:12 I just made a tincture with CBD isolate. I used fractionated coconut oil as the base. It’s 500 mg of CBD. I love love it. That and an herbal smoke blend with a little bit of THC. On cloud 9 girl

3055 2018-06-16 16:19:56 Thank you - we have tried the yellow oil but unfortunately the oil made Liam’s seizures worse. Cannabis is such an individualized medicine as I am learning.
3056 2018-06-16 16:19:52 Returning jihadis can be imported into the UK but not cannabis oil. The nation needs Brexit leadership but you seem more worried about ridiculous Upskirts Legislation. What a state this country is in ...

3059 2018-06-16 16:19:48 A person can only do,one or tje other. Your 2 options are like oil and water.
3060 2018-06-16 16:19:44 Oil prices are rising due to Wall Street manipulation of futures contracts.   It should be illegal to trade in futures if you do not have storage capacity for the oil being purchased.
3061 2018-06-16 16:19:32 It’s a perfect mixture of beeswax, Grapeseed oil and Canola oil. Both oils have a high smoke point and season beautifully at 480 degrees

3064 2018-06-16 16:19:16 We all notice that not even a drop of oil will leak from oil carriers but more than half of water from water tankers will always be spilled on road.

3078 2018-06-16 16:17:29 Ethanol is a net loss energy source. Creating it and transporting it burns more energy than the fuel creates. You can’t pipeline it so it gets transported end to end by trucks. I wish environmentalists would read up on what they are actually praising.

3080 2018-06-16 16:17:22 Funny enough to note but Alaska pays out oil dividends to its citizens and Nevada does not level state taxes which represent in some kind a form of universal basic income. You will find many retirees in those states.

3082 2018-06-16 16:17:09 That's for the media and the activists.  In the back end they are laughing all the way to the bank.  They haven't shut down too many oil platforms, turning all their funds into wind and solar, have they ... ?  
3083 2018-06-16 16:17:00 Wise decision, really. OIL?! Thats atrocious! I am never lending out books to anyone again either.
3084 2018-06-16 16:16:51 Canada is carbon neutral. Trudeau just lost the auto sector oil sector and now China is not buying our grain. Going to have no jobs and be a third world country if Trudeau keeps this up. Then the environment will be the least of your worries

3098 2018-06-16 16:15:08 Trump has no control of the gas prices. It is the greedy oil companies who control the prices. It is the same if Walmart or Target increases their prices. Trump has no say so. Do your research before you tweet your ignorance.
3099 2018-06-16 16:14:52 Reports indicate that Mike Pence allowed oil drilling in the Washington Post, but you were too distracted by Trump's tweets to notice.
3100 2018-06-16 16:14:50 All economists are crying hoarse about Curr.Acc.Def. which is rising mainly due to high oil prices. And the @FinMinIndia is, by design or by default, feeling worried. A bigger worry is imbalanced growth.

3118 2018-06-16 16:13:02 My mom knows I love to have fried rice for breakfast, so every time she goes out for east Asian food, she brings me home steamed rice to use the next day. It's the little things. (Today's was simple: sesame oil, soy sauce, an egg.)
3119 2018-06-16 16:12:51 this is ggggreat found out i look like a burnt potato bc me only uses oil control powder
3120 2018-06-16 16:12:45 i tried to make home fried potatoes but i cubed them too thick and they never cooked through but they got burned on the outside and also i didn’t heat the oil in advance so they stuck really badly to the pan and when i picked up the pan to wash it i burnt my hand really badly
3121 2018-06-16 16:12:31 I'd expect 8chan to combine with 9 gag, but never 4chan. That's like adding water to burning oil. It doesn't mix and causes a bigger fire.

And this approach is not a thing of day‘s gone-by, as it remains in force and is as operable today as it was then in the past.  In an interesting link of a very little known of, or widely...

3202 2018-06-16 16:02:55 Oh definitely!
3203 2018-06-16 16:02:55 #IhateDodge because they take 4hrs to do an oil change with an appt. #Redlands Dodge is the worst dealership in town.
3204 2018-06-16 16:02:53 Correct! Oil in 2018 should not be this high. Gas should be half the price. Please make it happen and win win win!
3205 2018-06-16 16:02:24 It’s not quite since “time immemorial”, but the curious thing is, that while the poverty ratio of Nigerians increased when the price of oil fell in PMB’s time, we hadn’t seen much decrease in the poverty of Nigerians under GEJ when the price of oil was high.

3208 2018-06-16 16:02:12 It’s a ducking disgrace! And the hypocrisy of the man that ordered it to be taken away! I’m near sure I read something about him working on a cannabis farm I think. I take pure cbd oil and it definitely helps for all different reasons
3209 2018-06-16 16:02:04 What would have been hilarious is if they drove out by the oil rig where he was working and he saw his home going down the road !!! 
3210 2018-06-16 16:02:02 Those products are extremely cheap to make, and use every cost cutting measure possible. The goal is to get the largest profit margin possible from the few they are able to trick with gimmicks. Tech equivalent of snake oil.

3212 2018-06-16 16:01:22 My easy go to that works with most greens - sautee with olive oil, vegetable stock, salt and pepper until cooked through. Season with red wine vinegar near the end of cooking to taste.
3213 2018-06-16 16:01:21 In a world-wide glut of oil, gas prices can only be increased by those controlling the distribution of supply; ultimately private equity wins through ownership of oil companies, to the detriment of the common man.

3222 2018-06-16 15:59:53 Why rupee is allowed to depreciate, if our economy is strong than rupee must be at the level of 50 rs, to keep export alive we are compromising import which is expensive, we need technology at cheaper rate, and oil import too. 
Manniya think over it, is it justified?
3223 2018-06-16 15:59:45 Point out the area She failed. What was Naira to dollar during her time and now that your Uncle is in charge? With a barrel of crude oil sold for 45 dollars then and now that its well over $70 per barrel, yet dollar and inflation so high.

3227 2018-06-16 15:59:21 Because the CBD oil in UK is made to be below what is actually needed. Its to keep GW Pharmaceuticals profits high. Anything below 20% CBD will not work and government know this.

3254 2018-06-16 15:55:15 I've been reading alot about keto genic diet for cancer treatment. Cancer needs sugar to survive. There are essential oils as well that appear to help, especially frankincense oil. Dont overlook prayer. All things are possible through christ.

3333 2018-06-16 15:45:47 Use a CBD from a non hemp based oil, more active compounds from cannabis sativa, more compounds after the THC has been separated. Both plants are the same cannabis family, but non hemp has more medicinal value.. It truly sucks that someone close to you is going through this..

Kalo gak salah ada merk body shop yg tea tree oil deh, itu juga bagus kok.

3338 2018-06-16 15:45:13 Oh shit the billy kid can use the cro oil for his epilepsy progress
3339 2018-06-16 15:45:13 You, on the other hand have not learned any lessons from history. The  Soviets murdered 30-50m, as did the ChiComs. Castro had 78k killed, Venezuela's now considering importing oil, Nicaragua's gov. has started shooting citizens.
3340 2018-06-16 15:44:54 아아악!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3341 2018-06-16 15:44:53 @LBC you can buy CBD OIL  in U.K. only 1 derivative of cannabis. #billy needs CBD and THC (another derivative of cannabis this one considered phyco-tropic illegal in U.K.)
3342 2018-06-16 15:44:49 Ok good to know. Have been opting for that one cause of price. Another thing to note is that I am running a mct coconut oil also. After 12 days I took a part of it (ca 1/4 of the cod liver amount) and filtered it. Much more c60 in the filter than of the cod oil after 48 hours.
3343 2018-06-16 15:44:47 Palm oil is the secret here; it has a shortening texture at room temperature, like the hydrogenated oil that regular Jif uses.
3344 2018-06-16 15:44:42 새로 산 오일 이름이 sea berry seed oil 인데 따라 읽어보니 씨베ㄹ....
3345 2018-06-16 15:44:42 I second that. I live in QC and the economic model is very diversified: high-tech (aerospace,AI,IT), metals/mining, agriculture, forestry, specialized manufacturing, engineering services and we are doing quite well. We are not dependant on oil, automobile.

3349 2018-06-15 23:59:58 so update on my Walmart rant it took me a good 30 minutes to change my oil but it was the first time changing my oil in this truck. That included finding my oil plug, the floor jack which was on the stock trailer, and figuring that my truck needed a 13mm wrench to undo the plug
3350 2018-06-15 23:59:48 Of course I have absolutely zero inside knowledge of anything and could be totally wrong about everything. Would be great deals for the Oil though.
3351 2018-06-15 23:59:44 So excited about this weekend!  Truck is looking clean crisp and FAST!! @j66anderson, go get s great finish!

3358 2018-06-15 23:59:02 It looks quite nice. Sear it with a little grape seed oil if possible, if you like it more on the well done side you can pop it in oven under foil.

3367 2018-06-15 23:57:53 Itll be an early wakeup for you tomorrow, since 1st practice is fairly early.  Good luck

3391 2018-06-15 23:57:11 When you're a snake oil salesman, you wouldn't want your snake oil to work otherwise you lose your consumer base.

3393 2018-06-15 23:56:51 The oil is fantastic it's too expensive still. I'm allowed two ounces a month at 430.00 per ounce out of pocket.. I can't afford it through dispensary the oil is around 100.00. For a little bit. It does give me huge relief from my arthritis and i.c. just so expensive

3397 2018-06-15 23:56:33 Sue them they will get so tired of being in court also they have no idea how much oil is there. They never did. It was Regan grift to balance taxes. No one knows how much or how little is there. They guesstimated the amount in the 80s. Take them to court. Make them show you.

3403 2018-06-15 23:56:18 Snake oil salesmen don't believe in the magical powers of snake oil, it takes a special kind of rube to buy into this... aka the current center RIGHT base of the dem party.
3404 2018-06-15 23:56:12 I was really up late last night ordering eucalyptus oil 
3405 2018-06-15 23:55:59 Gabriel nodded.

"And that's okay."

He snapped up a pot of boiling oil and tossed the chopped up potatoes in it.
3406 2018-06-15 23:55:51 I’m so hungry where is my little sister with this oil so i can roll up & start cooking
3407 2018-06-15 23:55:46 Backward Government stuck in the 1950s, its amazing how Heroin users can go to Morrison's and Chemists for there Methadone, but wont give children Cannabis Oil to help stop there Seizures, Hypocritical Stupid Government, oops i forgot the Pharmaceutical companies pay Politicians.

3410 2018-06-15 23:55:02 I disagree with his politics but wish him comfort and peace. Maybe he should turn to cannabis oil now that he’s back in Nevada. It truly helps.
3411 2018-06-15 23:54:21 I thought that hydrogenated oil has to be in semi sold form in low temperature .. and since corn oil is always liquid then it’s safe

3418 2018-06-15 23:52:22 Those countries were robbed of oil and resources NK is a different situation. Good try though. ;)
3419 2018-06-15 23:52:17 CBD oil is the new neckbeard vaping trend.

3421 2018-06-15 23:52:00 I have never disputed that fact jus loke men cant out perform them in others.
But those guys were doing a job women could do.
Heck I have seen women working oil rigs out in the ocean and they kept up and surpassed. 
I am jus showing my respect to the strength of their will.

3423 2018-06-15 23:51:57 My sister was denied on being allowed to use or have her CBD oil in the hospital.... but her nurse told her not to worry because she could have her Oxys every 4 hours for pain.... #bigpharma #bullshit #cbd

3425 2018-06-15 23:51:48 It’s the IMF saying it. But I guess they are wrong too. And the GC report, with all its errors is right..... I wonder which is more likely? How much oil is flowing into anyone’s coffers now? The oil days are over and we don’t have a time machine.
3426 2018-06-15 23:51:40 Propaganda, not actually what she was asking either. Still, a move in the right direction. I won't be and neither will be family buying any nestle products even when palm oil is removed from you products after the modern slavery scandal
3427 2018-06-15 23:51:37 We've known you can't mix oil and water for centuries. WTF IS  wrong with these ignorant so-called leaders?
3428 2018-06-15 23:51:11 His whole #billycaldwell situation is messed up. They’ve stopped him from getting his #cannabis oil and now he’s fucking dying. :/

No law should be able to dictate what a person can or can’t put inside their own body. Especially a derivative of a naturally occurring plant.

3436 2018-06-15 23:49:58 They take a funnel full of cake batter and let it drip into hot oil in a nest shaoe, they when it's warm and crispy on the outside, they cover it in stuff. Mine is icing sugar, cream cheese frosting and berries. Sooooo goooddddd....

3437 2018-06-15 23:49:53 I'm very frustrated with publications who continually publish that CBD is legal everywhere. Pro tip: it's not. Cold pressed hemp seed oil is, but only if you put it on your salad. @nytimes @racked Ask a writer on the beat!
3438 2018-06-15 23:49:52 The thing the blew my mind back then was that rust is just metal burning at a microscopic and slow rate. It's basically like charcoal. Also I hate that this rainy climate is making my tools rust. Time to break out the oil.
3439 2018-06-15 23:49:52 I feel like Heidi is twisting herself in knots trying to appeal to two constituencies. I wonder if she is going to refuse campaign contribs from oil.....as the Dems have demanded?

3442 2018-06-15 23:49:17 Okay.  So when Alberta stops pumping oil and the 3.1 million barrels daily don't deliver the tax dollars to Ottawa to split out among Quebec and other have not provinces anymore,  the Fed's can just turn out the lights and go home
3443 2018-06-15 23:49:10 Oil change and new tires now who tryna wash my baby?! 
3444 2018-06-15 23:49:10 Thai oil, strong enough to heal your entire being.
3445 2018-06-15 23:49:01 "We think we can get this stuff HALF way to oil at scale while still making the margins we feel entitled to. Maybe. Government will have pay backstop the risk, though." If it works, they'll want the taxpayer to build the infrastructure.
3446 2018-06-15 23:48:34 Seriously, I'm a virgin! Where do you think they get virgin olive oil?
3447 2018-06-15 23:48:11 Might as well get my oil changed tomorrow too
3448 2018-06-15 23:48:07 I'm of the mindset that the driver should never have to ask for gas money. It should be implied. If you aren't the driver, you take care of the person putting gas, mileage, oil and other general maintenance, and actual drive time in their car while you sleep. Just my opinion.
3449 2018-06-15 23:47:46 We need to do it all & ensure we adopt the best environmental practices when & where we can. That said, the fact we produce oil for others around the world who inhabit places without reliable energy is not something we should beat ourselves up over.

3454 2018-06-15 23:46:29 @realDonaldTrump Iran deal verified constantly, N Korean deal a lousy handshake and a signed piece of paper. Snake oil and you fall for it!
3455 2018-06-15 23:46:14 Paid $50 for gas and $104 for an oil change ... amazing lmfao
3456 2018-06-15 23:46:09 I forgot how chlorine just sucks all of the moisture out of you & leaves your skin dryer than a desert. I’ll need to bathe in a tub of rosehip oil for a week after to recover from this WOOF 
3457 2018-06-15 23:46:08 We will be back racing momentarily, there was an oil down, Round 1 Qualifying will be up in approx 20 mins.

GF: Hey babe you ready for date night? 

*Pulls out the twister mat and baby oil*

Me: been ready
3459 2018-06-15 23:46:02 Changed my oil (future Matt reading this, good luck)
3460 2018-06-15 23:45:48 Or at the very least break even/win the deals 
3461 2018-06-15 23:45:44 Me to the hub.. 
Whoever thought of squeezing the oil out a sunflower seed & knowing that it  needs to be heated and can fry stuff?
3462 2018-06-15 23:45:40 The Mission: Recover the oil finally meets its own backyard.
3463 2018-06-15 23:45:38 Explosions are the least of our worries. Oil polluting the ground water and giant aquifers could imperil the future of mass agriculture in America. But why worry, right?
3464 2018-06-15 23:45:37 Do I dare ask what the baby oil was for lol
3465 2018-06-15 23:45:23 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
3466 2018-06-15 23:45:22 So sorry to hear that :( take care of yourself, but yeah best to try to avoid palm oil when you can! I don’t want to convert you, it’s just facts that I wish people would realize so they consume in lesser quantities and enjoy what they have (less food waste)
3467 2018-06-15 23:45:18 LET THE OIL PHLOW!

Phresh oil will phlow over my entire liphe in this season! #DaughterOfTheKING
3468 2018-06-15 23:45:14 @VinnieTortorich Great podcast today with Dr Jay, fascinating! I'd love to have him interpret my 23andMe data. As for you getting preformed Vit. A, try cod liver oil. Rosita brand, extra virgin. Clean tasting, not fishy.

3473 2018-06-15 23:43:54 Chick fil a has such good customer service that when I went through their drive through they gave me a free oil change and even washed my car.
3474 2018-06-15 23:43:47 Total BS, my grandparents are Nordic and they never used Canola oil. Grandma lived to 96, didn't fry much and used butter.

3482 2018-06-15 23:43:02 I have no problems with the stuff, it's a plant for cripes sake. I buy the creams and the oil for under the tongue, for my mother who has severe arthritis. It must be nice to be in the mountains, it sounds beautiful. Thank for all the advice.

3488 2018-06-15 23:40:59 neoliberal stink tanks and cbc produce a lot of toxic hype, such as low productivity alerts, when in reality productivity is skyrocketing with shrinking incomes. oil status quo expansion also serves elite interest and financialization which the board defends with carbon-pricing.

3495 2018-06-15 23:40:15 Hey Trevor, there is no bad batch to our knowledge.  We use an all natural Rose Petal oil as part of the authentic flavor profile and we believe that is what you may be interpreting.
3496 2018-06-15 23:40:01 Heavens you're going to keep me up all night thinking about all this.. OK all monopolies are run by capitalists gas oil coal to name just a few do you think workers rights are to the fore with these guys.. seriously

3499 2018-06-15 23:39:44 Neem oil. I tried over the counter chemical treatments to no avail. But neem oil worked instantly. You can get it at health food stores.

3504 2018-06-15 23:38:47 They would go even higher if Canada would slap tariffs on all exported oil.

3506 2018-06-15 23:38:46 Much of the bad blood with Russia is caused by George Soros money and influence.  Soros is still financing and creating grants and other money to anyone and everyone willing to push his propaganda.  He wants our oil, gold, and whatever resources he can get.
3507 2018-06-15 23:38:45 I could do without the political shit, but we all have our own opinions. I think what drives me crazier than anything is the fact that @KySportsRadio is from eastern KY and couldn’t save himself if he tried. Dude, you gotta learn how to change a tire, your oil & hang a pic...
3508 2018-06-15 23:38:44 Keep buying the snake oil
3509 2018-06-15 23:38:42 my skin is dry af and also covered in oil this is the life i live
3510 2018-06-15 23:38:11 @ArizonaDEQ How to do you go about reporting illegal oil/fluids/freon dumping/release where action will actually be taken? Reported to county many times, nothing being done.
3511 2018-06-15 23:38:09 おうがいさん√なんですが、子リスちゃんって呼ばないで！！(しにそう)ってなってる。子リスちゃんとか可愛すぎて無理、あとお前呼びも好き……
3512 2018-06-15 23:37:59 Oil prices is going to level up.
3513 2018-06-15 23:37:47 i just came for an oil change  now i need an air filter  lmaooooo i hate oil changes
3514 2018-06-15 23:37:30 It's nice to hear the words of wisdom for a change instead of oil when making up stories the truth is they did it they don't want to admit to it everybody knows it and Trump's getting blamed for it while he's my president and I stand behind
3515 2018-06-15 23:37:27 To the kids with the banner: from now on, point to the massive EV investments already made by the automakers. Oil is doomed economically, politics are irrelevant.

3526 2018-06-15 23:35:16 I'll just keep pounding on this ad infinitum; Tony Seba is right and every oil facilty will be a stranded asset in a very short time. True it may keep operating at marginal cost but the investors will get killed. It ain't hopeful- it's already under way.
3527 2018-06-15 23:35:15 #OOTT #WTI
In case you are holding long bags of #US #Oil now, there could still be chances that you may be able to bail yourself out. Nothing goes straight down although it's much faster than going up...

3529 2018-06-15 23:35:04 Monopolies are aided by the government far more often than they are hurt.
  The classic examples ("standard oil, etc.) Had already lost large amounts of market share naturally before the government got around to doing anything.

3532 2018-06-15 23:34:43 I just paid for my first oil change & I feel grown asf  this shit sucks.
3533 2018-06-15 23:34:39 remember when @pattibacchus wouldn't let oil companies provide funding for schools? Oh, good. She's cc'd on the string. Let's hear what she has to say #vanpoli #vanre
3534 2018-06-15 23:34:30 I have just read your article on Medium and thought it excellent; infinite growth is clearly impossibe on a finite planet.  But why mention only oil (which can eventually be replaced with renewables)?
3535 2018-06-15 23:34:26 Castor oil&a good washday routine that's basically it
3536 2018-06-15 23:34:25 Idiot all the US army ever did was protect oil
3537 2018-06-15 23:34:24 Literally just paid $104 for a fucking oil change wtf
3538 2018-06-15 23:34:22 Also called hash oil
3539 2018-06-15 23:34:22 I wonder what oil would look like using this technique?
3540 2018-06-15 23:34:21 It won’t smell of oil if she did.
Stick to wanking over Lonsdale and Tommy Robinson you sad, hide away cunt. 
3541 2018-06-15 23:34:13 Can never just go in an get a quick oil change they always trying to tell you, you need to buy this or another part doesn’t look so good
3542 2018-06-15 23:34:12 Imagine having to take your cod liver oil tablets with your Viagra on holiday 
3543 2018-06-15 23:34:12 Lumber. Produce. Electronics. Consumer goods. Oil. Cars. Precious metals. The US is not capable of producing or providing all these items at the level we demand.

3548 2018-06-15 23:33:36 You are saying Scotland is uniquely incapable of running its own affairs?

Our GDP is larger than France's without oil.

Your asking me to trust the tories. The party that wants to have a 'bonfire of EU regulation'

You believe Gordon Brown's drivel?

Im sorry for you.

3551 2018-06-15 23:33:21 Snake Oil at it's best!
3552 2018-06-15 23:33:18 Baby Oil is my face's best friend. 
3553 2018-06-15 23:33:01 Government having monopolies that benefits the people is the way to go. Electricity, gambling, alcohol, pot, even oil !
3554 2018-06-15 23:32:56 What about the attack on Derna and the destruction of its infrastructure besides the killing of innocent people. Benghazi before that as well. Oil is not more precious than the blood of innocent people. Double standards are not welcomed nor tolerated.
3555 2018-06-15 23:32:54 He owns Tesla. Electric vehicles and sustainable energy technology (solar panels etc). You probably hear bad shit because it is not in the best interest of big oil for him to be successful. So anything to keep us oil dependent really. Thats short version.
3556 2018-06-15 23:32:49 More per capita because they make big bucks on the oil fields and pay taxes accordingly. That’s how it works.
3557 2018-06-15 23:32:32 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.
3558 2018-06-15 23:32:17 There is this drink called 'Neck Oil' which I have been drinking all night and it is fantastic.
3559 2018-06-15 23:32:13 Our national oil company Statoil just changed its name to @Equinor_. Slowly transitioning towards renewables, mainly ocean wind. But it's gonna take decades. Our sovereign wealth fund is so big now that it can soon replace oil tax income.
3560 2018-06-15 23:32:09 It`s the only option to preserve our culture under castillian one..
No State, no weapons, no oil. Only our know-how.
3561 2018-06-15 23:31:55 Lol it was a joke, tho my hands do get dry after washing them. Also no way am I putting coconut oil on my hands, smells awful
3562 2018-06-15 23:31:28 You should be drug tested.  The Klein era did so much harm to this province we are still dealing with it today.  All he did was surf on high oil revenue.

3569 2018-06-15 23:30:43 Unfortunate, indeed. Maybe I'll try making my own roe and olive oil dressing sometime.
3570 2018-06-15 23:30:21 Dude surfed on oil revenues while doing ZERO for the province.
3571 2018-06-15 23:30:19 Fun Fact Friday:  Extra virgin olive oil is the healthiest fat on the planet!
That's a pretty big title to give to olive oil.

I have equal opportunity to pursue and achieve success in general.
I don’t need the oil industry. There are plenty of others, many still very new with incredible potential.
3576 2018-06-15 23:28:41 Alex told me his head hurt last night and I said “i have a crystal for that” I gave him my amethyst to put on his forehead along with with some peppermint oil on his temples and it put his ass to sleep!!

3578 2018-06-15 23:28:20 I'm surprised they haven't been hit with the anti-trust hammer (the thing that wrecked standard oil, and Ma'Bell) or even RICO'd.
3579 2018-06-15 23:27:45 @DavidVenableQVC  Hi David I was wondering what oil do you recommend or use for the demos for doing French fries in the copper chef pan. You love fries so I was wondering what brand they use doing copper chef demonstrations for fries. 
Thank you for your time.

3582 2018-06-15 23:27:11 Inconsistent af but when the oil is fresh they’re definitely top 5. Also tough because I don’t really consider them a “fast food” joint
3583 2018-06-15 23:27:02 URGENT: Trump and Interior Secretary Zinke are rushing to open the Arctic Refuge to oil and gas drilling. Act now and stand up against any move to open the Arctic Refuge to Big Polluters!
3584 2018-06-15 23:26:39 But also: pipelines are designed for the corrosive properties of their specific products; repurposing them for vastly (chemically) different products is usually more intensive a project than just building a new one. Oil and water both corrode steel, in different ways.
3585 2018-06-15 23:26:26 Possibly something like frozen potatoes on hot oil. Something totally not safe, anyways.

3599 2018-06-15 23:22:53 Fuck right off.
If fishing was the same money as oil, fair play. But it isn’t and never will be.

3602 2018-06-15 23:22:01 Part 1 HOW TO MAKE: 
 In a saucepan add water, 2 1/2 tablespoons of sugar, salt and 2 table spoons of vegetable oil. Mix them together, then add flour to make the churro dough. Stir them all together roughly.
3603 2018-06-15 23:21:50 Then there's Maryam Monsef who hides where she's really from...because saying she's from Afghanistan has a certain 'je ne sais quoi' that @JustinTrudeau hopes people will lap up like the 'diversity' snake oil he perpetually sells. (but only when it suits him).

3610 2018-06-15 23:21:22 I agree it’s time. With NAFTA gone there is no requirement for Canada to supply the USA with oil. Applying export duty on 41% of all oil used in the US will change the conversation.
3611 2018-06-15 23:21:19 I just found 15+ oil paint tubes that I got as a gift when I was 9 and never used. Guess who is gonna learn how to use oil paints!! This bitch!!

3625 2018-06-15 23:18:13 The Bush's were a shady lot of troglodytes. Jr wanted to control the oil and lied about WMDs. We created the middle eastern monsters and now we bomb the monsters, from above the clouds, killing the innocent as well. What miracle will ever stop it all??

3632 2018-06-15 23:17:06 INGREDIENTS: 
- 1 cup water  
-2 1/2 tablespoons white sugar 
-1/2 teaspoon salt
-2 tablespoons vegetable oil
-1 cup all-purpose flour 
-2 quarts oil for frying
-1/2 cup white sugar, or to taste
-1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3633 2018-06-15 23:16:29 He was awful.  I sorta hated to unleash him on the nation, however glad I was to see him go.  We still have his awful boss--the governor.  Pruitt worked very diligently to do the oil lords' bidding and to roll back every ecologically friendly law.  And he sued the EPA.
3634 2018-06-15 23:16:22 Oh good, our Nige starting his version of Radio Mille Collines.  I look forward to the broadcasts telling his disciples to chop the smart trees.  Utter fraud and purveyor of snake oil.

3686 2018-06-15 23:06:03 Actually that's incorrect. Rail is the safest way but unfortunately our rail system has been neglected & when a bunch of engineers were going to retire, CP Rail quickly rushed through replacements. We currently don't have a safe way to transport oil
3687 2018-06-15 23:05:44 Oh deer. 

But seriously:
- start with canola oil, heat pan until boiling slightly. 
- cook until about 135-140 degrees.
- baste with butter as you cook.
- let it rest after. 

It will be smoky, but should taste good.
3688 2018-06-15 23:05:36 I aint no oil painting but thats is one rough bird.
3689 2018-06-15 23:05:35 USE WARM WATER♡

- use warm water to wash your face, the warmth of the eater helps dry out the oils. Use plenty of soap when washing your face as this helps to dissolve the oil.

3696 2018-06-15 23:04:53 Venezuela's problem was being overly reliant on a single export (oil), whose price crashed.

3697 2018-06-15 23:04:47 No, they are a scam. You statement that they are delivering a middle class miracle is a snake oil scam. There are no facts behind it. Calling it a miracle is an insult to your extended family's Catholic faith and your Christian faith.

3718 2018-06-15 23:00:52 Yes. Your mom is pardoned. The 20-something in Costco awkwardly discussing olive oil with his roommate? No pass.
3719 2018-06-15 23:00:51 Remittances from USA is Mexico's Top income source, over and above their crude oil production.

Let that sink in.
3720 2018-06-15 23:00:50 I just spilled my whole bottle of sunflower oil i feel sick.

3724 2018-06-15 23:00:29 Note to self ... baby oil does not come out of hair easily
3725 2018-06-15 23:00:27 Then 10 more times for it to find some olive oil.

3728 2018-06-15 22:59:27 coming in and going out of the Saraha Desert.  The oil companies were now in bed with the doctors, the which doctors in the Serengeti Plains.  Too many people had died through the years in front of Chanel Inman's house in Malibu and tribal courts that were set up to harass those
3729 2018-06-15 22:59:23 UNPREDICTABILITY is watchword these days: Oil Price Speculation(in out of date tech) investment firms loved could cause Bank Failures. #IFF
3730 2018-06-15 22:59:08 It is fun for awhile but it sucks....unless you got some serious cash flow
3731 2018-06-15 22:59:02 I assume you have traded oil futures before? I just don't like the schizo way they trade.... $USO is more my speed or call/put spreads
3732 2018-06-15 22:59:00 I just learnt that Ronaldo's Nigerian nickname is Ororo(oil)
3733 2018-06-15 22:58:39 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
3734 2018-06-15 22:58:24 We are all setup at High Point Raceway in Mount Morris PA for round 4 Lucas Oil Championship.  @tucker_powersports is joining us to celebrate their new brand.
3735 2018-06-15 22:58:04 What!! Oh my gosh, what an honor. Thank you so much. I'd like to thank my parents, obviously, my cat Mister, Mike Meyers, the guy who changed the oil in my car last week, whoever invented the internet, and Taco Bell for inventing that sauce in their quesadillas.
3736 2018-06-15 22:57:53 Sheikh “How much oil do you want ?”   Putin “ Uh This much ! “
3737 2018-06-15 22:57:29 banger that was.  Now let's begin with scripture reading:  "The day started the same in the back jungles of the Rain Forest of Africa along the Sahara desert side, nobody was helping the German botanists from getting to the truth behind why different rain forest had oil pipelines
3738 2018-06-15 22:57:26 One quart of oil will contaminate 1 million gallons of groundwater.
3739 2018-06-15 22:57:13 Oil is temporary.
Alberta needs a long term solution.

China will be a world leader in renewables very soon, while you’re knee deep in oil nobody wants to buy in a few decades.

Food for thought.
3740 2018-06-15 22:57:08 Coconut oil really is the cure for sadness
3741 2018-06-15 22:57:08 If I had a Wells Fargo card I'd go and check if I was able to buy a gun.

Glad I don't. Preventing access to a constitutional right? Could be frowned upon. Certainly would be if they denied loans to CNN because they objected to what they use the money for.
3742 2018-06-15 22:56:25 I made some amazing body shimmer oil and I feel to bottle it and sell it for real

3745 2018-06-15 22:55:52 Not a leftist just a climate change believer that doesnt like the far left conspiracy falsehoods that come up. It is called an investment that has no pollution after it is set up. Did you forgot there is no input into well heads or tar oil.
3746 2018-06-15 22:55:45 Bout to go home and smoke a fatty while I relax in a lavender oil and epsom salt bath. My Friday nights are low key and I’m soooo okay with that.
3747 2018-06-15 22:55:36 Before Americans discovered oil Norway had the same economic development as Bulgaria. I hope you are focussing on the energy sector.

3752 2018-06-15 22:55:02 Is palm kernel the same as palm oil @LINDORUK @LindtUK ? If so I’m gutted because I love your chocolate  and another item falls off the shopping list  Also is the plastic wrap round each chocolate recyclable? Thanks

3754 2018-06-15 22:54:57 Nigerian youths are lazy and uneducated, they only want to sit down and enjoy oil money, I think this is a hate speech from PMB to Nigerian youths. What is the penalty for that offence again?
3755 2018-06-15 22:54:29 my dick while into the man  i will with cooking oil
3756 2018-06-15 22:54:04 Just heard that May has denied the cannabis oil that a young boy who desperately needs this medicine to control his 100+ fits a day. Apparently the PM et al feel it goes against their Christian beliefs. Allegedly. Meantime, a young boy is suffering greatly. Allegedly.
3757 2018-06-15 22:54:00 No amount of oil will ever bring moisture back into the parts of my hair that used to be blonde. But it was worth being blonde for 3 years 
3758 2018-06-15 22:53:56 You've captured the differences nicely, and you've captured my angst as well. It isn't the reader necessarily, nor the opinion, that concerns me. It's the snake oil. I have anger issues. 
3759 2018-06-15 22:53:55 If you apply the oil, THEN  the Saran Wrap, the shirt MIGHT survive!
3760 2018-06-15 22:53:46 This is our chance. The future of the Arctic Refuge is about to be decided. Join me and @TheWCS to say "Absolutely no drilling for oil and gas in the Arctic Refuge" http://1/#.WyRDeLRbixg.twitter
3761 2018-06-15 22:53:43 My skin's hella fleeky. The way it just glistens in the sun. Gahhh damn, I don't need any coconut oil to do that. It's just oh natural chocolate dipped icing on the cake. You feel what I'm saying?
3762 2018-06-15 22:53:40 Smothered myself in coconut oil before I laid out, I don’t look any darker

Then do thick patches of typhus and drybrush them.with riza if you want
3765 2018-06-15 22:53:23 Climate change has become a political hockey puck. It’s a hot button that only a small faction pays serious attention to...... It really is time to explore alternatives to oil because it won’t be around forever. And we need support/education from our government. Facts do matter!
3766 2018-06-15 22:53:14 Don’t be like me lol go in for an oil change and leave with a new car
3767 2018-06-15 22:53:10 If they can point me to the part that says a nation shouldn’t have borders that’d be great. I can, however, point them to the part that says Satan knows the Bible, too.

3770 2018-06-15 22:52:38 I second this. My mom switched from a synthetic opiod to CBD oil and it was quite literally a life saver.
3771 2018-06-15 22:52:16 believing people who sell you organic is like believing what the oil companies say #scams #topoli #toronto
3772 2018-06-15 22:52:10 I guess the snake oil salesmen never told you implosions are illegal. They violate state and Federal law on fugitive emissions and OSHA law regarding respirable silica. Plus the resulting debris and area are contaminated afterwards by carcinogens called Phenols
3773 2018-06-15 22:52:01 Wherewith shall I come before Jehovah, and bow myself before the high God? 

Shall I come before him with burnt-offerings, with calves a year old? 

Will YHWH be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil?
3774 2018-06-15 22:52:00 ...and Seni's law and why block protection of horses/dogs - would probably also shout against cannabis oil that little boy desperately needs now.....makes you sick!
3775 2018-06-15 22:51:49 Got my oil changed/tires rotated for my car and as well as cleaned, 
Got a pedicure,
New makeup,
And a new dress, definitely was a successful day

3780 2018-06-15 22:51:35 Flavored with a ton of garlic/extra olive oil/some lemon .... tastes great as a dip for snow peas/regular edible shell peas/sweet peppers/cucumbers/celery/carrots/broccoli/fennel/sweet onions/sour dough toast/radishes/artichokes/etc., etc., etc.

3783 2018-06-15 22:51:13 How did that tea get to your house? Apparently you need to consider supply-chains....and Robert is still wrong because he apparently has no clue how much oil we move by rail because we don’t have pipeline capacity
3784 2018-06-15 22:51:03 I was gonna make myself some brownies to help me feel better but I don't know where the hell my vegetable oil is so

3790 2018-06-15 22:50:09 @bbc5live Why doesn't this woman go live where CBD oil is legal. ??? If child's life/ welfare at stake
3791 2018-06-15 22:50:09 I’m really happy to see National in the Climate Commission tent with Labour, The Greens and NZF. 

A start would be stopping the ridiculousness on ending deep sea oil in 30yrs. Also try be positive about the huge leaps Auckland is making in the public transport & cycling space?
3792 2018-06-15 22:50:03 who was it gave away 20% of the oil price ? Mulroney ? that was some negotiating , whoever .
3793 2018-06-15 22:49:46 Punishment or Rehab= Our system is all about Rehab so those in the "throw away the key camp" are trying to have a Punishment outcome in our Rehab System=Square Peg wont go in to a Round Hole. Oil and water dont mix. The various systems since WW2 HAVE NOT WORKED=TIME FOR NEW WAY!!
3794 2018-06-15 22:49:40 No one loves me more then the guys who change my oil
3795 2018-06-15 22:49:38 If this picture was a picture in real life. Then what this man has is more in value to me than all the tea and rice in China; more than all the oil under the ground, more than all the gems and gold and silver in the caves of the earth. Take stock my friends in the true riches
3796 2018-06-15 22:49:23 Black seed oil! Just lost a friend to cancer 5/18/18essiac tea and paradise precious greensboth my uncles did not fair well from chemoI will pray for you

No question oil goes up after OPEC meeting - they will say whatever they need to. If mkt has priced in 1M bbl increase, they'll announced 500k

Will be good week for $USO
3802 2018-06-15 22:48:19 Obama is nothing more than a snake oil salesmen!

3804 2018-06-15 22:47:56 @ThomasDeLauer my dr. suggested strongly that I take fish oil supplements, any recommendations on best types, brands, etc? Thank you, love the YouTube channel. A new fan.
3805 2018-06-15 22:47:51 I think well bounce back a little bit if we do absolutely nothing. The scary part is if we want to improve the team, i just dont see how. No cap space/trade chips to deal without opening a hole elsewhere. Very sad indeed

3809 2018-06-15 22:46:51 Need to develop controlled H fusion to melt those martian cliffs of ice... Some will scream at ecological devastation. Not so: right now, the European Union, this high temple of hypocrisy, import enough palm oil from South East Asia to kill all the Orangutans there. To make FUEL!

3814 2018-06-15 22:45:51 i hate getting anything done to my car because they always tell me something that’s wrong with it when i just need an oil change .. pls stop :(
3815 2018-06-15 22:45:51 There will be a strong youth movement against this. Not good for future finances as oil and gas are not sustainable and lawsuits aren't cheap. Not good for a little thing called earth we would need to live on.
3816 2018-06-15 22:45:36 You can go to Ford Larry Miller on 1300 south and get a 3 oil change and tire rotation for 75
3817 2018-06-15 22:45:34 PENG!!
3818 2018-06-15 22:45:33 Let’s face it the law’s the law but the Home Office has contacted the Mum tonight and offered to give the confiscated cannabis oil back to her and her son.

3823 2018-06-15 22:45:03 That’s as good a place as any. I’ll be watching from this oil rig, many, many miles away from any alcoholic beverages. :(
3824 2018-06-15 22:44:54 This paragraph & the one before it. Verbatim as per my method  the cool fridge enviro retains the seperate functional integrity of the various oils. Room temp is relatively High in oil solution world & thus may activate chem reactions among them.

3832 2018-06-15 22:44:03 the government for effectively forcing them to leave the UK.

“No mother should be made to flee the country to keep their child alive,” she said. The pair have spent about four of the past 12 years abroad because cannabis oil is illegal in the UK

3839 2018-06-15 22:42:21 Ya think if cannabis oil could save the little boy's life they would have passed that....or just shouted 'object' irrespective..... nor evidence of interest in fact that Seni could still be alive if law passed & it appears ok to attack horses/dogs - a sad day for the UK!

Also, pls keep quoting the bible when you get to the verses of scripture on gay marriage and abortion that don't suit your radical agenda
3845 2018-06-15 22:41:39 A drop of olive oil and lemon juice to an ice cube then running it over your face gives you better results than some most skin care products
3846 2018-06-15 22:41:00 I know I've said this before.... Have you tried CBD Oil?? I use 1:8 for day use and 1:4 for night cuz it helps me far asleep... But it really helps with anxiety and helps but not cures chronic pain

3862 2018-06-15 22:38:10 @NickHurdUK  what would you do if this was your son? Billy needs his oil please give it back!!
3863 2018-06-15 22:38:06 @StephenNolan dear God I hope the people who confiscated this child’s cannabis oil are listening to this. How can they sleep in their beds hearing this poor woman. Surely giving the child a chance is only humane. Appalling.
3864 2018-06-15 22:37:55 Friends: I'm taking apart our only car on Sunday because the oil leaks are severe enough that it's bleeding out. 1. Does someone have a torque wrench I can borrow? 2. Anyone available to give me a lift to the parts store in case I didn't get everything I need? Please & thank you.
3865 2018-06-15 22:37:52 Canola oil is not healthy.
3866 2018-06-15 22:37:34 This is our chance. The future of the Arctic Refuge is about to be decided. Join me and @TheWCS to say "Absolutely no drilling for oil and gas in the Arctic Refuge" http://1/#.WyQ_oUxr0BY.twitter
3867 2018-06-15 22:37:33 Fuck Stephen Colbert----establishment shill.  He put down democratic election of Chavez and pumps out the pro-Mzduro propaganda for the US's final take down of another oil patch (world's largest)-------that's capitalism.
3868 2018-06-15 22:37:24 Relax. All is well in the USA. Sniff some lavender oil and ENJOY the RIDE on the TRUMP TRAIN!!!
3869 2018-06-15 22:37:14 We like oil and water
3870 2018-06-15 22:37:13 Nothing about Trumps policy on ripping children from their parents seeking asylum ? More GOP lunatics . Vote these sick people out ! PS gas prices have eaten up any tax cut I got , another GOP fave , tax breaks to oil companies
3871 2018-06-15 22:37:05 1/ Cannabis can actually relieve anxiety in some people, me being one of those people and also you can use CBD oil which is a component of cannabis that doesn't make you high, and tends to help with both pain and anxiety.
3872 2018-06-15 22:37:03 Coconut oil just makes it worse for me... My friend is an esthetician and she said it’s really bad to put coconut oil on your face actually :/

3874 2018-06-15 22:36:35 What type of Oil ?
Be specific pal ...
3875 2018-06-15 22:36:35 Oh, hey, y'all.

I'll be joining @donlemon tonight in the 10pm ET hour. 

I'll be wearing Saran Wrap, olive oil, and a well-pressed shirt.

3877 2018-06-15 22:36:17 This will not happen without an adequate and equal substitute program in promoting green over dirty energy. Not on the watch of the youth who will inherit this nation and planet from the greedy gas and oil tycoons who want you to promote this ignorant agenda.
3878 2018-06-15 22:36:15 Oil prices are about to rise for everyone. it's about to get worse. and then we are gonna blame vulnerable minorities.
3879 2018-06-15 22:35:58 ppl saying oil yikes in my experience oil makes them itchier. I’d suggest gels instead or the aloe plant like they said
3880 2018-06-15 22:35:55 Now I’d be willing to go try Pequods if someone else would be my second and help drain the lake of sauce and oil off the top and leave the cheesy crust for me
3881 2018-06-15 22:35:53 I need more oil paints and canvases
3882 2018-06-15 22:35:52 
3883 2018-06-15 22:35:38 Spurs and Big Baller Brand are equivalent to oil and water, that ain't happening
3884 2018-06-15 22:35:33 Depends how old they are. If the oil is still fresh then I’d avoid it but if they are old and dried out I’m sure it’s fine.
3885 2018-06-15 22:35:28 Drink Water. Meditate. Lather Yourself In Coconut Oil. Get Your Nails Done. Read Books. Start A Business. Mind Your Own.
3886 2018-06-15 22:35:25 Just did my first dose of MCT oil. Can't remember who I saw talking about it, maybe @ProperOpinion ?
3887 2018-06-15 22:35:09 You fucking kidding me. The river tyne used to be thriving.
In the 80’s tradesmen earned £1000 a week for 7 x 12hr shifts. 
So basically, Oil and gas, Pharmaceuticals, Electronics and any other manufacturers in the NE.
3888 2018-06-15 22:34:55 They always call me “boss” at the Valvoline oil change place. 

It makes me feel important.

3889 2018-06-15 22:34:54 Ultimate Father’s Day queen right here: I just got my oil changed and texted my dad “I got my oil changed.”
3890 2018-06-15 22:34:53 Once a pore becomes clogged, it traps skin oil inside. Bacteria grows in this oil and can cause an inflammatory response in the skin.
3891 2018-06-15 22:34:53 No surprise!  All the PC leadership candidates were going to do this.  It is just a tax and does not deter anyone from using oil, etc.  Need to find another way.
3892 2018-06-15 22:34:48 Girl conditioner and aloe vera oil after i shower all the time
3893 2018-06-15 22:34:47 not only oil - military as well: uk nuclear arms dump; nuclear deterrent usa's first line of defence; uk military training area; Scotland is close to Russia- invasion of England could be through Scotland.  It's not only economic implications for westminster if Scotland splits
3894 2018-06-15 22:34:44 God has given me the oil of gladness...
3895 2018-06-15 22:34:42 No child should suffer like this Surely some dealer can make the oil give it to mother to administer!! #GiveBillyCaldwellHisMedication
3896 2018-06-15 22:34:32 “A story isn't a charcoal sketch, where every stroke lies on the surface to be seen. It's an oil painting, filled with layers that the author must uncover so carefully to show its beauty.”

3897 2018-06-15 22:34:24 Epileptic boy 'in life-threatening state' after cannabis oil seized; Billy Caldwell, the 12-year-old boy who had his anti-epileptic medicine confiscated by the Home Office this week, has been admitted to hospital, with his mother saying his condition is life-threatening.
3898 2018-06-15 22:34:22 Tried to make balsamic glaze. Bought balsamic vinaigrette, which doesn’t turn into glaze no matter how long you boil it. Because oil doesn’t burn off. 
3899 2018-06-15 22:34:09 LOL when the BMW guy quotes me $250 for an oil change
3900 2018-06-15 22:33:59 In their oil based paints which is more durable Satin Finish or Eggshell? Why? How doe they quantify durability... hardness, toughness, adhesion?
3901 2018-06-15 22:33:51 They think land out there has oil on it tho
3902 2018-06-15 22:33:49 Wait didn't Nxamz the great preside over an even higher oil price....?
3903 2018-06-15 22:33:26 Emu oil is great for extremely dry, cracked skin.
3904 2018-06-15 22:33:17 “It shall come to pass in that day That his burden will be taken away from your shoulder, And his yoke from your neck, And the yoke will be destroyed because of the anointing oil.”

3908 2018-06-15 22:33:04 A .03 drop in relative wage with inflation is meaningless. It's taking a very specific subset of workers, and even among those their wages grew at 2.8% (needed 2.9%, but even article admits its due to oil spke). This article is almost an intentional attempt to to deceive readers.
3909 2018-06-15 22:33:00 Opposite happened to me.  No Stelter but still Tapper.   Tbf  I probably tried real hard.
3910 2018-06-15 22:33:00 Something similar happened to me..get to the pool early before the oil slick forms Ugh!
3911 2018-06-15 22:32:39 To use the same analogy, Islamic invaders are like mustard oil in that milk.
3912 2018-06-15 22:32:29 "BP, bringing oil to US shores."
3913 2018-06-15 22:32:29 I work with a lot of menopausal women, Most of us aren't taking HRT. We could power a small country on the electricity we use for our fans. Tea tree oil and lots of water can help according to "the Internet"
3914 2018-06-15 22:32:25 She needs a pat on the back because her industry DOES SO MUCH FOR THE PLANET! Screw that and You cathy and Your GreenWashing. Deplorable people in the oil industry, Many of my ex family are in the industry, violent alcoholics, the lot of them. Screw them too.
3915 2018-06-15 22:32:19 You don’t get it, do you? Big oil foresaw alt-left cultural Marxist attack on oil products. Lefties were elaborating on Club Of Rome #BS to regain power lost to good old capitalism. Oil executive strategy to fight that correctly predicted attack is logical. Capeesh?
3916 2018-06-15 22:32:19 And at OfSTED towers, (with connections ring doors to DFE) there are burning the midnight oil to find a way to doctor their own data.
Just priceless
3917 2018-06-15 22:32:03 Great information! Does CBD oil also help reduce BP?
3918 2018-06-15 22:31:58 I hate having oil under my nails
3919 2018-06-15 22:31:57 ah, used motor oil, I did both cars and the tractor, need to hit up a disposal trip asap
3920 2018-06-15 22:31:51 The government is terrorizing Native Americans on their own land..for BP OIL CO. The boarder patrol ran a man over....on his own land..the gvt has no right on their land never mind trying to kill them for oil!
3921 2018-06-15 22:31:50 Rice vinegar..grated ginger..orange zest...splash of fruity olive oil....good to go!
3922 2018-06-15 22:31:34 Isn't it the butter that keeps it from sticking together? Same thing happens when you add a bit of oil.
3923 2018-06-15 22:31:25 Oil rich country owns ya... Without them you would be championship... Again

3926 2018-06-15 22:31:09 A country gets richer by advancing mining, manufacturing, and agriculture. Mining includes oil and gas. Manufacturing includes software engineering. We will be a wealthier nation in the long run, with the new tariffs in place.

3928 2018-06-15 22:30:39 The way I see it it's like trying to mix water with oil .They both need to be in there own seperate containers.Britain is just being polluted with one big slick.
3929 2018-06-15 22:30:37 Yes, because he's destroying the environment and enriching big oil, mining, coal, the list of polluters with money goes on and on.
3930 2018-06-15 22:30:34 Quite possible. Manafort did IMO. He was hired by Barzani.   Trump and Pompeo gave Kirkuk to Iran and the Russians. Rosneft took the gas and oil fields.  They gave Afrin to Turkey and al-Qaeda.
3931 2018-06-15 22:30:23 Yes I have great faith in your ability to manipulate the ignorant masses to believe in you, and purchase that bottle of snake oil too
3932 2018-06-15 22:30:20 Muy buenas preguntas!!
3933 2018-06-15 22:30:12 I want to put your tanning oil all over you!!!
3934 2018-06-15 22:30:07 Now I'm thinking of you wrestling in a paddling pool full of oil. Thats what you meant by 'fight' -  right? Maybe I am a bit of a perve after all  Great pics today though xx
3935 2018-06-15 22:30:00 Ive heard putting aloe on your scalp and letting it sit for an hour then rinsing it out works, also coconut oil & prenatal vitamins are supposed to help too.

3937 2018-06-15 22:29:09 Stephen,I feel literally sick by child dying due to halted cannabis oil.
3938 2018-06-15 22:28:57 All I hear is people whining that the government shouldn’t bother doing this because the oil companies will just raise prices. The point is the PCs are keeping a promise which is something the Liberals didn’t do for 15 years. @ryandoyleshow @JayOnTheRushTO

3946 2018-06-15 22:27:34 Same bro my argument was pretty much one sided but used both macro and micro 
Spoke about how contracting output cause rise in AC as they move away from MES & spoke about Macro effect of downward multiplier effect upon Countires like Ven 50% Gov Rev comes from oil
3947 2018-06-15 22:27:33 Con los productos Haier que pasaron la frontera durante años, equiparon mas de 253 mil familias. Y las remesas que se enviaron en divisas a Colombia ¿quien las totalizó? Los vehículos que por años se han llevado por Maicao, ¿sabrán quien los tiene?
3948 2018-06-15 22:27:33 Yeah but we lost those series because of the Oil crisis, Iran hostages and!Reagan Assassination attempt.
3949 2018-06-15 22:27:02 Check out BlackArch or Long’s Shadow holsters
3950 2018-06-15 22:26:46 My aunty made me drink a tablespoon of black sesame oil to help my cough today omggggg it tasted so FOUL. Literal petrol
3951 2018-06-15 22:26:32 If you guys were wondering what I’m doing right now, I’m hiding by the dumpsters outside the oil change place because two men in the waiting area were following me and sexually harassing me. Don’t be that guy.
3952 2018-06-15 22:26:24 Epileptic boy 'in life-threatening state' after cannabis oil seized; Billy Caldwell, the 12-year-old boy who had his anti-epileptic medicine confiscated by the Home Office this week, has been admitted to hospital, with his mother saying his condition is life-threatening.: …
3953 2018-06-15 22:26:05 In the Trump era this is ABSOLUTELY NEEDED. THERE SHOULD BE A MAJOR OVERALL AND DOWNRIGHT exception list of where MONEY TO POLITICIANS CANNOT BE ACCEPTED.

3954 2018-06-15 22:25:45 ほんま青ボタン叩いたらミサイル撃てるようにならんかな
3955 2018-06-15 22:25:33 these people are coming for a serious reason.  we need to address the root of the cause.  we have neglected our southern neighbors for too long and pursued oil in the Middle East
3956 2018-06-15 22:25:28 No doubt the oil money has been squandered as a result of the UKs EU membership however a large proportion of it was also spent on benefits in Scotland
3957 2018-06-15 22:25:14 i think ima have to pull up there this weekend since you reminded me. i need them pizzas and steak and wiiine . its been too long. the house bread with the tomato olive oil is the one and its free
3958 2018-06-15 22:24:58 Nothing to kick you awake like a bit of chilli oil in the eye.
3959 2018-06-15 22:24:57 I dont even know but my tunnel kept falling out so i figured it was ready. Little vitamin e oil + hot bath, slipped right in.
3960 2018-06-15 22:24:50 @temerbey sameone said china? Goose feather, bear oil, dog boil...
3961 2018-06-15 22:24:49 to make it even trickier: would Draghi have been able to get QE without oil price collapse feeding through to inflation?
3962 2018-06-15 22:24:40 in the waiting room at the oil change place, and there is a White Woman in here with me who is very put out about her wait. like, so irritated. I hope this manager is ready for a firm talking to.
3963 2018-06-15 22:24:40 It’s not the oil companies, it’s the governments with all those damn taxes to feed the “system”.
3964 2018-06-15 22:24:26 time to oil up and then give her meat a good ol' rub
3965 2018-06-15 22:23:53 Also omega-3 fatty acids; when low can cause #depression an inability to focus. Supplementing fish oil; getting in foods with high omegas can be critical. Also low iron, zinc, and B12 all can affect mood. Regular multivitamin and attention to all of these is key.
3966 2018-06-15 22:23:42 How about running this story prime time and interviewing Congressional officials who have oversite for that industry?? It's amazing when crude oil prices goes up & gasoline prices follow but when crude prices drop gasoline is very slow to come down. @FoxNews
3967 2018-06-15 22:23:40 All I want is a bomb oil massage
3968 2018-06-15 22:23:38 i like aliengear iwb holsters for their plastic belt clips that dont tear thru your clothing but i dont feel like they hold as close/tightly to your body like a galco king-tuk
3969 2018-06-15 22:23:32 There spirits broken, their eyes hollow, their souls sucked from them. They are machines. And the oil companies are their god.
3970 2018-06-15 22:23:06 Getting oil change check, now for the waiting process and then off to filming TIS S2 E5: “Tired And Lost” and it’s gonna be a huge episode for sure, I’ve been hearing a lot of positive feedback and I’m excited to get this out sooner for you guys
3971 2018-06-15 22:23:04 Meanwhile Fox and Breitbart are alive and well. The biggest pile of bullshit on the planet. So much so that it's banned in Canada for being exposed as FAKE NEWS. What's wrong with you people. Can't you see a snake oil salesman when he's right in front of You?
3972 2018-06-15 22:22:51 HE BETTER GET HIS ASS OUT THERE AND WIN THIS ELECTION. WE DON'T NEED RICK SCOTT AND THEY SURE AS HELL KNOW HIM.   HE SHOULD BE AT EVERY EVENT GOING ON IN THIS STATE.  GO SUPPORT THE PUERTO RICANS WHO BEEN LEFT BEHIND.  WE WILL HAVE OIL RIGS TO LOOK AT OFF OUR BEACHES. WAKE UP
3973 2018-06-15 22:22:50 害国
3974 2018-06-15 22:22:19 If youre so concerned, Mr Bridges, why are you opposing the government's ban on new offshore oil drilling exploration? You can't voice concern on climate change and then keep drilling for more carbon fossil fuels.
3975 2018-06-15 22:21:56 i washed my hair yesterday and i put too much coconut oil and now it looks like i didn’t even wash it 
3976 2018-06-15 22:21:42 @SavoyLeather
3977 2018-06-15 22:21:36 As do the majority of republicans & the majority of “religious” snake oil practitioners & the majority of the blinkered sheep that follow @realDonaldTrump !!!
3978 2018-06-15 22:21:34 He also reaches out to oil & gas companies to write his next EPA rule.
3979 2018-06-15 22:21:26 We know oil based paints yellow and embrittle. How do water based paints, age and fail... i`m sure they arent eternal!
3980 2018-06-15 22:21:25 Absolutely. Ill check them out when i need ro reup on the oil.
3981 2018-06-15 22:21:19 だめだこりゃ！！
3982 2018-06-15 22:21:08 Please tell me why I thought it was a good idea to smoke a joint before I got an oil change
3983 2018-06-15 22:21:01 Trumpesus is bubbling with cover in boils and excess waste/oil, running on some intense drug to keep its consented sex pheromones pumping while vents violently low-grade word vomits supported by his miniature or virtually no self-esteem & self-driven artificially inflated ego.
3984 2018-06-15 22:20:55 Sarah James, an elder from Arctic Village is speaking to @BLMNational now. “We did everything right. We followed all the channels. There needs to be government to government consultation” before any oil exploration. #StandWithGwichin
3985 2018-06-15 22:20:55 But by how much I guess is the question. I'm reading numbers all over the place. I don't really know what to believe. How much would be too little (250,000? 500,00?) that it might cause a little oil rise? How much would be good where we continue this fall to under 60 (me hopes)?
3986 2018-06-15 22:20:54 Every time she says “prosciutto” or “Parmigiano” I want to punt her little olive oil bottle
3987 2018-06-15 22:20:47 So also does the use of raw coal and oil will be lasting peace!
3988 2018-06-15 22:20:47 A horse smashed my foot - cannabis oil helps with the pain somewhat...AND my dog's stress (when given to dog...) I'm a Traditionalist - I go for the brownies!!
3989 2018-06-15 22:20:42 i been frying a lot of cabbage with onion lately i add left over meat and rice dark soy ....salt....hot sauce,,,,,sesame oil  i really enjoy still crunchy

3993 2018-06-15 22:20:26 Do you want me to stop at the subsidies, the land uses, the environmental cleanups, or the health consequences?  The prices of the wars we fight for oil rights? The veteran costs of those wars? (Just kidding, we don’t spend much on our vets once they’re done fighting.)
3994 2018-06-15 22:20:12 Right..... and it's going to keep going up. California keeps raising the tax on gas and crude oil is going up which means more at the pump
3995 2018-06-15 22:20:08 Coconut oil helps mine stay curly but I need something new for like the frizz bc FUCK
3996 2018-06-15 22:20:01 I was about to go out, but I forgot that I dropped my car off for an oil change 
3997 2018-06-15 22:19:51 おっはー
3998 2018-06-15 22:19:49 As petroleum minister in the last weeks of the corrupt Abacha military  regime in 1998, Etete awarded the prospecting rights to the OPL 245  offshore oil block to Malabu Oil and Gas Ltd, a shell company in which  he secretly held a substantial stake.

4002 2018-06-15 22:18:55 If you are painting multiple coats over a day or two, how important is intercoat abrasion for durability of the finished product. Is the answer different for oil and water based products.
4003 2018-06-15 22:18:53 The liberal government approved Kinder Morgan pipeline and Bp to drill for oil off the coast of Nova Scotia. We must #keepitintheground #forourKids liberal climate plan is not adequate!
4004 2018-06-15 22:18:46 When you order same day service by Walmart early in the morn (9:49 so basically 10 AM) and it is still isn’t ready by the time you get off.  plus your car almost dies cuz it’s fucking hot outside and you realize you need another oil change.......
4005 2018-06-15 22:18:32 @SOPHIEMSMSMSM will Oil be on Compact Disc? also u should work with @playboicarti
4006 2018-06-15 22:18:19 No me  joooooooooooda!! 
¿Y no tiene un hijito, para ponerlo en Mercal?
4007 2018-06-15 22:18:07 What is a good place to get an oil change tire rotated and top off all fluids
That will not break the bank — looking for recommendations
4008 2018-06-15 22:17:29 a microwave oven fuelled by cooking oil
4009 2018-06-15 22:16:46 Olive oil, tilt your head and let it soak in
4010 2018-06-15 22:16:38 If You Love Me .. Get Me Black Soap & Beard Oil...
4011 2018-06-15 22:16:26 That’s what I said!! And I also said I just want the basic oil change nothing else, and they came in and said “your washer fluid is low do you want us to fill that too?” And I was like yeah go for it. Cost me ten extra dollars
4012 2018-06-15 22:16:22 6.4L with some issues.    Unit was brought to us after someone drained all the oil and put the plug back in.  It turns out that no lubrication makes bad things happen.
4013 2018-06-15 22:16:19 Faith doesn't come by praying and fasting or by drinking anointing oil. It comes by hearing the Word of God.
4014 2018-06-15 22:16:14 Oh no, were they trying to sell Colloidal Silver too?  It is nothing but snake oil.
4015 2018-06-15 22:16:03 They were undercooked and wet from 20 pounds of olive oil
4016 2018-06-15 22:15:59 When I want to “be good” I do lettuce, kale, cucumbers, sprouts, grilled chicken, tortilla strips, and some oil based dressing.
If not I add ranch dressing
4017 2018-06-15 22:15:49 It’s Scotlands Oil!
4018 2018-06-15 22:15:28 I have ibs really bad, but I find that putting peppermint oil on where it hurts with another oil like almond oil? Works wonders, even sniffing it! Eating plain foods, or indigestion tablets. X
4019 2018-06-15 22:15:18 Don’t use canola oil. it’s bad for u. use butter or lard instead
4020 2018-06-15 22:15:17 The more that this unravels this was a syndicate that figured HRC would win and they would all get rich. Trump, his kids, Manafort, Pence, Russia, the NRA, Assange, Stone, Parscale, Kelleyanne, Bannon, Giuliani et al. Oil, money laundering,
4021 2018-06-15 22:15:06 They mine diamonds there to the blast the rocks with radiation and then the diamonds glow greenish and collect them.After the rods are depleted they throw it in the river for servicing the trucks they make a big hole it the ground and throw the oil in there.Its complete bs
4022 2018-06-15 22:15:00 >continued: "... It's an oil slick of negativity that clings to the fine hairs on her skin. The driveway stretches to the front door of her house like pulled hot taffy."
4023 2018-06-15 22:14:48 They do....???...then how come for DECADES THEY'VE done NOTHING!!!??? Please help me @CDCgov =Center Disease CONTROL and PREVENTION, 24/7 SAVING lives PROTECTING people.....so tell me what they gonna do? Use the Grapefruit Oil excuse again? As always, no Action is taken. sad huh?
4024 2018-06-15 22:14:45 To win Tama-chan's used tampon, Keitaro must eat 21 dimes covered in olive oil
4025 2018-06-15 22:14:33 No. you don't have the same opportunities. That's why oil money all spans back decades if not centuries. There's no 2010 Rockefellers. The families who were around during or shortly after colonization had opportunities no one will ever have again. How can you deny this?
4026 2018-06-15 22:14:24 It's psychological and financial oppression. DWP and the NHS have joined forces to roll out work coaches starting with the severely mentally ill. Severely mentally ill? These people are mentally ill themselves from where I'm standing. Snake oil salesmen.
4027 2018-06-15 22:14:17 らあめん。
4028 2018-06-15 22:14:10 How did that oil from Middlesex get hired? Got to keep the place pukka, donchaknow

4030 2018-06-15 22:13:32 My stepmom gave me some coconut-flavored dental floss, and the taste reminds me of nothing so much as movie-theater popcorn...which it turns out is popped in coconut oil!
4031 2018-06-15 22:13:31 omg um oil & sweat??????
4032 2018-06-15 22:13:31 I counteract my day to day #stress with holy basil  extracts, #magnesium oil topically, wild reishi  and #meditation  and nature. And guess what? It works. No need for #drugs of any kind. #heavilymeditated
4033 2018-06-15 22:13:26 Need a @Dodge ??? Avoid #RedlandsDodge  who has the worst service department in California. Overcharging for oil changes, while taking FOUR HOURS with an appointment.
4034 2018-06-15 22:13:23 Jiffy Lube Guy: so when would you say your last oil change was?

“Uh.”

JLG: it should say on the sticker inside your windshield if you’re not sure

“Uh that sticker fell off two years ago. Avg driver does 12k a year, gimme a second to do the math. okay ya, I guess 27k miles ago”

4040 2018-06-15 22:12:29 You don’t need a dad to teach you how to change your oil
4041 2018-06-15 22:12:26 They’re taking my car for an oil change  since I never have time!

4044 2018-06-15 22:11:52 TFW you text the wrong person about buying cannabis oil for your dog
4045 2018-06-15 22:11:48 i've actually started taking CBD oil this week to try to help! I started out with something cheap and lower-concentration though so I might need to experiment more to find something more effective
4046 2018-06-15 22:11:43 Many specialised medical applications require thc and other cannabinoids alongside CBD to achieve what's known as an 'entourage effect'.  

I wish it was as easy as simply giving the poor wee fella the correct dilution of CBD oil.
4047 2018-06-15 22:11:42 White people on Diners Drive Inns and Dives use pepper, salt, and olive oil as their only seasoning
4048 2018-06-15 22:11:14 Whether there is democracy or not it is not problem. If you have oil or some strategic place in this world. U.S.A can bring democracy to your country.
4049 2018-06-15 22:11:04 You really tryna spend your money on dirty oil and pieces of hair
4050 2018-06-15 22:11:03 Did he do it while holding an oil can?
4051 2018-06-15 22:10:38 @Dodge #Redlands Dodge free promotion of how hideous your service department is. #sexist #rude #junk FOUR HOURS FOR AN OIL CHANGE W/ AN APPOINTMENT

4065 2018-06-15 22:08:05 Do y’all think if I swapped the baby oil for brownie batter, @CoruscateDame would lick it off me instead of the bowl?

4068 2018-06-15 22:07:51 With time, dust, conditioner, oil, germs, even dust mites can collect in your hair brush! Clean your brush on a regular basis!
4069 2018-06-15 22:07:45 Stop touching your face!! Put tea tree oil on it. I have some
4070 2018-06-15 22:07:43 Give #BillyCaldwell the cannabis oil now!
Dont wait for medical reports, his Mother has told you, he has deteriorated rapidly since the oil was confiscated!
#newsnight
4071 2018-06-15 22:07:36 Seriously... like the way standard oil caused the development of those non-petroleum based resources... oh wait. Generally new businesses start from savings / loans. Investors don't want in until after it's profitable. Do you think investors are waiting for a tax cut to invest?
4072 2018-06-15 22:07:20 Colin, my sister died from breast cancer 2 years ago. She used it and it took away a lot of the pain and appeared to slow the spread of the tumour. The cannabinol comes as oil, it doesn’t get you high. In epilepsy it has an amazing effect and actively stops fitting.
4073 2018-06-15 22:07:19 Retweeted DailyFX Team Live (@DailyFXTeam):

Brent oil and WTI crude took a hit heading into the weekend, down -3.37% and -3.84% respectively after China announced it will impose tariffs on US fuels
4074 2018-06-15 22:07:10 Hey, Donald, That's not a fake jail your buddy Paul is sitting in. He's about to become someone's sloppy bottom! I suggest Crisco oil!  @realDonaldTrump
4075 2018-06-15 22:07:08 We live by coconut oil in our house. I had a hard time getting Jeff to use it, but once he did, every time he has a scape or skin imperfection, he goes straight for it with no hesitation
4076 2018-06-15 22:07:03 Bro are you seeing this? What is that man doing to that goat?????
OMG, Gross Barf....
4077 2018-06-15 22:07:00 Yep it got rid of some old oil rigs and took a charge :/
4078 2018-06-15 22:07:00 It’s not yiayia’s orzo unless it’s served to you 30 minutes old and soaked in olive oil
4079 2018-06-15 22:06:55 But u lot be having oil in ya 
4080 2018-06-15 22:06:54 I worked for the RRC for 21 years. These commissioners work for the oil and gas industry lobbies, not the citizens of Texas. They're campaigning for reelection from day one of their appointment. Period.
4081 2018-06-15 22:06:37 Keep on draining next  Let's go find out why these oil prices are gone Up We need prices to stay low so people can travel And not worry how to get to work groceries or any other thing.
4082 2018-06-15 22:06:27 VARY BETWEEN COCONUT OR CANOLA OIL ON A SPOOLEY FOR LIKE A MONTH STRAIGHT ABOUT 5 TIMES A DAY

4085 2018-06-15 22:06:07 @iainlee @FlippinKath the weirdest thing is that i buy cannabis oil over here. No problem.
4086 2018-06-15 22:06:05 ทำไมฝรั่งเขาออกเสียง oil ว่า ออลเอล อะ
4087 2018-06-15 22:05:44 @BabestationTV doesn’t get much better than a Friday night on BS with a #ButtNaked @AshleyEmmax #XRated #PhoneSex .... unless #Oil gets thrown into the mix #Filthy #OilFans #OilOverload #OldSkool
4088 2018-06-15 22:05:38 That's ironic, a conservative whining about money given to an oil company!
4089 2018-06-15 22:05:37 Extra oil in the pan before you add the batter. The edges soak up the oil and make them crispy. You’re welcome.
4090 2018-06-15 22:05:31 oil of every pearl's un-insides is a masterpiece. SOPHIE fuckin rules
4091 2018-06-15 22:05:31 Can’t wait 2 try the blueberry bliss growth oil yo
4092 2018-06-15 22:05:26 @kaperoni lying Bruse is at it again.  Two days ago he claims 5 tankers full of oil coming to US.  Today, he claiming 3 ships are coming.  Did 2 sink?  Or did he “forget his facts”?
4093 2018-06-15 22:05:12 The stuff in Holland and Barrett is 5%.   It's easy to buy much less dilute CBD oil - there's a legal market.  If it was as simple as CBD oil with no other cannabinoids there would be no need to leave the UK.
4094 2018-06-15 22:05:06 Lavender or peppermint oil sometimes help mine.
4095 2018-06-15 22:04:48 Never had this much problem with a oil change. Guess I’ll let someone do it. Charge me double and cheat me out my car 
4096 2018-06-15 22:04:47 Theres the giant ball of oil.
4097 2018-06-15 22:04:46 ahem trader joes tea tree oil facial cleansing pads, their rose water and apple cider vinegar but u gotta dilute it a bit bc it could be too strong heheh
4098 2018-06-15 22:04:31 タリアjg練習しなきゃダメかな、、、
難しいな～
4099 2018-06-15 22:04:29 Because I am waiting for my oil change and am catching up on my feed, let me just say: be an advocate for the week and the vulnerable. It's usually not hard. I'm not even asking you to do anything. Just watch how you talk and maybe, maybe, call out others when they are ignorant.
4100 2018-06-15 22:04:14 우루우우ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ카이토ㅜㅠㅠㅠㅠ
4101 2018-06-15 22:04:08 Oil & gas? Why are those industries needing so much processing power?

4112 2018-06-15 22:01:53 @NickHurdUK it’s legal to give heroine addicts methadone, so why can a poor defenceless child not have cbd oil that will save his life? If Billy dies, this will be your fault. You will have the blood of a 12 year old boy, on your hands!!! #billycaldwell #savebillyslife
4113 2018-06-15 22:01:51 this vitamin E oil works wonders

4115 2018-06-15 22:01:35 お帰りなさいー。
4116 2018-06-15 22:01:28 Sorry but these people will never integrate into western society......not all but most, those that can't respect our laws should be shipped off to where they came from plus all their relatives, it is oil and water, they do not mix
4117 2018-06-15 22:01:26 @NickHurdUK if that was your son in the hospital I bet my life on it that he would receive the cannabis oil, so why are u depriving billy?Have you any compassion at all?How can u sit back and watch this.If anything happens billy you should be done for murder #keepbillyalive

4120 2018-06-15 22:01:20 I remember, and I think the parallels in the lies as fact and the doublethink are much closer than #auspol realises. Much closer. Our snake oil salesman () might be better educated and less of a showman, but it’s the same grift.
4121 2018-06-15 22:01:10 Contrary to popular belief, dewy make up looks great on oily skin. The secret is oil control but the glow... whew
4122 2018-06-15 22:01:08 Try castor oil, hair oil, or benefits magnet.
4123 2018-06-15 22:01:02 Yeah, our airbnb has no oil or coffee but 3L each of maple syrup & peanut butter

4127 2018-06-15 22:00:52 Can’t never just come in & get a oil change, it’s always some extra shit I need w/ it 
4128 2018-06-15 22:00:50 You can see why Norway didnt allow Politicians to get involved when they wanted to make plans for oil money
4129 2018-06-15 22:00:36 What’s a hot oil treatment?
4130 2018-06-15 22:00:35 Learn how pipelines in Canada work and who owns them ;) no tariff will ever be placed on crude oil from Canada moving into the US. We are the only economical market for their crude

4134 2018-06-15 22:00:19 Process the oil in Canada and distribute it to Canadians.  I am all for green energy, but there is no way we are just going green cold turkey.  In the far north, we need oil yet.  Green automobiles are not realistic for the distances we travel and the cold we endure (batteries).
4135 2018-06-15 22:00:11 Dirty Alberta sand oil should remain in the ground!
4136 2018-06-15 22:00:05 @Hillhick @dersoto62 yes. True. I’m looking for oil to continue it’s path down, as for broader market I don’t know, it wasn’t enough.
4137 2018-06-15 22:00:03 Yay! Old Man OG took my car in for a new tire and an oil change, THEN washed and vaccuumed it, too!  All set for summer!
4138 2018-06-15 22:00:01 If you want to reduce the consumption and importation of oil, raise the price at the pump. If you are complaining about the u.s. trade deficit, use less oil or be prepared to pay more.
4139 2018-06-15 21:59:50 1) NI receive most Barnett: nope. Scotland receives more than NI & Wales combined. 2)’Your’s is useless’ - what is this? A playground argument? 3) ‘Scotland’s Oil’ - Funded by everywhere but! It would still be in the ground otherwise. I’m not the one lacking education here!
4140 2018-06-15 21:59:49 I just attempted castor oil but no construction yet only runny tummy
4141 2018-06-15 21:59:35 He no oil painting. Lol
4142 2018-06-15 21:58:53 Oil? Bitch you cookin?
4143 2018-06-15 21:58:45 Lots of customers reporting oil fuel dilution problems following the ea189 fix. Reports of too many regens causing this. Fuel in the oil in a Diesel engine? #anotherfinemess #laurelandhardy #vwfixfail
4144 2018-06-15 21:58:04 Two new tires, alignment, oil change.. Nissan ya killin ya girls pockets 
4145 2018-06-15 21:57:34 Tonight I have come to the momentous decision that I prefer Gamma Ray to Neck Oil #Beavertown
4146 2018-06-15 21:57:22 WOW Did we just basically have the majority of a fractal cycle in one day? Next week might be tricky. This stupid OPEC crap is truly affecting the oil market's moves.
4147 2018-06-15 21:57:15 I agree with Fernsy. I’d rather put the wok on high heat slap a bit of olive oil in there and drop my drooping balls in there until they’re cooked right thought than even share the same seat in a taxi with Flack
4148 2018-06-15 21:57:04 OCW! OCW! OCW! OH SEE DUBU!! OH SEE DUBU!!! OIL SEA DOUBLE!! OIL SEA DOUBLE!!! OI SAY DOOB! OI SAY DOOB!!... I'm lost... check it out... @OCWnewsline
4149 2018-06-15 21:56:59 Don’t you remember. The oil ran out two years ago.
4150 2018-06-15 21:56:57 腹痛い死
4151 2018-06-15 21:56:55 being natural is hella expensive. i’ve paid almost $50-$75 just on shampoo, deep conditioner, leave in conditioner, twist cream, oil & edge control. y’all sleep 
4152 2018-06-15 21:56:44 Trump's cabinet is full of people with AMAZING resumes! Why, they've run some of the greatest oil corporations and pyramid schemes around! Being rich is a science!
4153 2018-06-15 21:56:38 Let’s be clear! Your bs is about Lac Magentic right? Oil from the US Balkan’s frack show. Now let’s talk about what would happen if bitumen would have been on that train k
4154 2018-06-15 21:56:38 Car is fixed now I need to get new tires and an oil change.
4155 2018-06-15 21:56:29 Total distraction from Trump's real interests in the Pipelines, which have the Canadian Approval all over them

Trudeau was just stopped from buying another pipeline.....

Its all over oil and these "Tariffs" are for goods both countries have so is there really an argument?
4156 2018-06-15 21:56:21 Virgin oil has a lower smoke point compared with extra virgin due to its higher acidity. I would only recommend good low acidity #evoo (less than 0.3%) for frying and sauteing.
4157 2018-06-15 21:56:19 bringing my neti pot stick and oregano oil to the function baby let's get healthy
4158 2018-06-15 21:56:08 Kfb @Amma_Bukar
4159 2018-06-15 21:56:02 Course of treatment is personal choice. Some believe chemo works, other go more 'natural'. My family member who has brain cancer is doing both. Chemo and CBD oil.
4160 2018-06-15 21:55:59 This gyal take style fine sha @Amma_Bukar
4161 2018-06-15 21:55:47 I have this gallery idea of expressing disorders through my oil paintings with a cubism approach
4162 2018-06-15 21:55:32 Revelation 6:6 (CJB)
Then I heard what sounded like a voice from among the four living beings say, “Two pounds of wheat for a day’s wages! Six pounds of barley for the same price! But don’t damage the oil or the wine!”
4163 2018-06-15 21:55:30 You think? Turn off the oil taps and start sppropriating pharmacy patents, then let’s talk#neverfearabully
4164 2018-06-15 21:55:24 While u play with the devil (oil lords) your own Argentina falls to evil abortion!
4165 2018-06-15 21:55:15 I was either not alive or a baby for all that. I was a kid in the attitude era. I did catch Hulk Hogan's last wrestling run. And of course I saw his horrific sex tape when he showed himself to be a racist scum.
4166 2018-06-15 21:55:04 Shit is all fucked up in the ocean  b'ys..Just talking to son who's on a Oil tanker outside  Loon Bay(headed in Lewisporte) and the bay is full of caplin..
4167 2018-06-15 21:54:51 Kawasaki gotta be the hardest bike to change to oil on man  I never took that long
4168 2018-06-15 21:54:43 Putting Peppermint oil on the walls in the sauna is soothing 
4169 2018-06-15 21:54:24 Like my main sketch is a watercolor brush, but my main color is oil? But then for textures I usually go for chalk or crayon? And then for shadows I fiddle with marker ones. = 3 = And then to make good blends, I airbrush solid lines with the lighter tones? DOn't know if that helps
4170 2018-06-15 21:54:21 Anaerobic work & ketosis the most difficult of its many applications (aerobic work is where it shines).. . But pre workout I take Salt, MCT oil, h20, and some creative monohydrate. Exogenous ketones some days for heavy legs
4171 2018-06-15 21:53:42 For oily things....use a cup to microwave, the oil just drips out.
4172 2018-06-15 21:53:34 I went to go get an oil change and had no idea what was going on smh
4173 2018-06-15 21:53:34 I’m living for @superdrug’s own make Vitamin E body and hair oil. Arms and legs forever glowing to the gods 
4174 2018-06-15 21:53:21 need to get myself a thing of Scythe coating her dick with the sensitivity oil she has
4175 2018-06-15 21:53:12 Wait till us Canadians put a tariff on our oil then 6 a gallon will be the norm
4176 2018-06-15 21:53:10 It is sure easy to say build it when you are not the province who will have to deal with the spill and environmental impact and wildlife deaths of one. Maybe by the time it is built oil will be extinct for the most part and all it will be good for is transporting water.
4177 2018-06-15 21:53:01 Thanks. It’s a constant issue. I’m really hoping I don’t have permanent nerve damage from Oli’s birth... hoping it just goes away as Theo gets older and I hold him less. But it’s been a companion for about 3 years now.  might be getting that CBD oil soon ...
4178 2018-06-15 21:52:59 STG I HATE GOING TO GET A OIL CHANGE THEY FIND A MILLION DIFF SHIT WRONG W MY CAR STUPID BITCHES
4179 2018-06-15 21:52:46 I just want a oil change got me going all around Philadelphia smh

4183 2018-06-15 21:52:15 CloakTuck by @AlienGHolsters for IWB for sure. Looks bulky, but it isn't.
Standared blackhawk! for pocket carry.
4184 2018-06-15 21:51:58 Changed some ball joints today. Found they were loose when doing our oil change inspection last week... another reason to have a auto shop change your oil instead of a quick lube shop
4185 2018-06-15 21:51:55 spending my first paycheck on a vat of CBD oil
4186 2018-06-15 21:51:47 Put coconut oil on itinstagram:
4187 2018-06-15 21:51:40 URGENT: Trump and Interior Secretary Zinke are rushing to open the Arctic Refuge to oil and gas drilling. Act now and stand up against any move to open the Arctic Refuge to Big Polluters!
4188 2018-06-15 21:51:31 sea salt soaks , tea tree oil , h2ocean !!
4189 2018-06-15 21:51:27 can you re use the same cooking grease ? oil whatever it’s called ?
4190 2018-06-15 21:51:25 Good grief...burn some midnight oil like @DblJLorenz ok. 
4191 2018-06-15 21:51:03 i did a coconut oil hair mask
4192 2018-06-15 21:50:49 Have you tried smothering it in aloe Vera or coconut oil? They might help
4193 2018-06-15 21:50:07 I'd legalise tomorrow but it wasn't CBD oil.  You can buy that in Holland and Barratt.   My understanding is that it contains more than the accepted level of THC (0.02%).   Your point still stands right enough.
4194 2018-06-15 21:50:03 She had a whole team of pastors annointing every square inch of that place with oil and pleading the blood of Jesus over the White House and commanding every foul demon to leave.  She was very wise to do so
4195 2018-06-15 21:49:57 @JNJParents help looking for baby oil creme anyone know why it was discontinued
4196 2018-06-15 21:49:49 baby oil all 2018 is not the move.... these flys are tearing my legs up
4197 2018-06-15 21:49:47 @KilclooneyJohn if you have any sway at all, please help Billy get his oil back tonight
4198 2018-06-15 21:49:39 Canola oil is actually pretty good
4199 2018-06-15 21:49:35 Don’t depress me! I recently combines all my pensions and started putting away more money each month.. then I went and bought some cod liver oil and anti wrinkle cream 
4200 2018-06-15 21:49:35 Oh he don’t do car work he changes oil recharges my air tops my fluids. Anything major he can’t do .
4201 2018-06-15 21:49:26 What that's only like 8 hours a day every day for eternity

And your work clothes definitely don't feel of oil vats. Nope.
4202 2018-06-15 21:49:09 <みなさんにとっての"オイル"とは何ですか⁇
4203 2018-06-15 21:49:03 Traditional Eid breakfast at home,  Panayaram (fermented batter made from rice, urad dal, extra fenugreek seeds than usual) cooked in indhayam gingely oil and mixture of desiccated coconut, ghee and sugar on the sides. #Ramadan
4204 2018-06-15 21:48:58 I'm pretty sure that, us bombard them from the sky in order to destroy the gouvernement and taking their oil caused it
4205 2018-06-15 21:48:56 Got a fancy mint & argan with chia seed oil lip balm 
4206 2018-06-15 21:48:43 The Gwich’in people depend on the coastal plain of the #ArcticRefuge. @BLMNational and @SecretaryZinke: selling these sacred lands for oil $$$ is a human rights issue. #ProtectTheArctic #NoArcticLeases
4207 2018-06-15 21:48:33 this hot oil treatment feels amazing my scalp needed this TLC.
4208 2018-06-15 21:48:26 2/2 I have absolutely NO faith in National doing anything with this other than acting to ensure greedy businesses like the oil industry continue their destructive practices. 
History has proved Nat's will put profit over any other cause - only doing this so they retain control
4209 2018-06-15 21:47:56 I am asking seriously. Do you really think the economy is tied to oil. Please educate yourself and listen to the scientific community. I beg you before it’s too late.
4210 2018-06-15 21:47:55 Brent oil and WTI crude took a hit heading into the weekend, down -3.37% and -3.84% respectively after China announced it will impose tariffs on US fuels
4211 2018-06-15 21:47:41 Trump bitch... 2026 bitch... Oil bitch.
4212 2018-06-15 21:47:35 Simplify! That sounds awesome.
4213 2018-06-15 21:47:28 No UN intervention.  It is infiltrated by agenda based people. Oil money has destroyed this institution aswell.
4214 2018-06-15 21:47:16 you know what i miss. those little rubbery beads filled with scented oil that you put in the bath? i remember you used to be able to get them in all sorts of fun colours and shapes
4215 2018-06-15 21:47:09 I bless you and anoint you, holy soldier, with this holy oil of the legume.
4216 2018-06-15 21:46:45 Canola (rapeseed) oil is not digestible by humans; thus diarrhea. Great for lubricating granny's sewing machine, though.
4217 2018-06-15 21:46:44 Looking forward to celebrating my father Sunday!!! 
Gift certificates for craniosacral Therapy , essential oils and Massage are great gifts :)
4218 2018-06-15 21:46:06 I bet the oil companies are terrified that @fordnation has put them on notice.
4219 2018-06-15 21:46:03 Allah qarama aljihun babban yaya nauyi ...
4220 2018-06-15 21:45:39 This administration is still fighting for their Flat Earth Theory how can anyone expect them to believe in Global Warming and Climate Change, besides the coal and oil industries pay well.
4221 2018-06-15 21:45:30 Lol with or without yeast!? Cause all you need is flour water and salt and olive oil
4222 2018-06-15 21:45:26 Sorry to hear  dad has tried Cannabis oil I think, but it’s not worked clearly  it’s an evil evil disease!
4223 2018-06-15 21:45:21 Check your Engine oil this afternoon.
4224 2018-06-15 21:45:20 I just wanna drink Piña coladas  on the beach   . I wanna tan and smell like coconut  tanning oil with 3spf . I wanna smoke some weed and grill little weenies . #summertime
4225 2018-06-15 21:45:11 I put a red dot on mine.
4226 2018-06-15 21:45:09 Patchouli oil, thank fuck someone knew the name of it. 
4227 2018-06-15 21:45:00 Lol, where are the farmers? All these phantom schemes. I process Soya Oil & and I know what the demand for Soya Meal/animal feed is. We are real sector players, not social media business people like you. We know what goes on in the industry firsthand
4228 2018-06-15 21:44:39 if you're not all slathered in olive oil you're only half assing it.
4229 2018-06-15 21:44:33 You know,everyplus mine,.See that orbiter, there in photo, it has microchip capability to store unlimited volume of cosmos man's spiritual oil. 
He can expand cosmo100's X times faster,than #DictatorTonyBlair can destroy it.Bitter to his end of dreaming,our Orange conduit, won.
4230 2018-06-15 21:44:09 The oil will be worthless in a few short years as oil nations scramble to get their product to market before the inevitable collapse. This will create a massive oversupply
4231 2018-06-15 21:44:07 Add essential oils for amazing body oil, apply to Skin when wet so there is no transepidermal water loss and your skin reaps all the benefits! 
4232 2018-06-15 21:43:53 #RBD will do want #Ukog did last summer except it will hold the price. Good luck all ;) #OIL #GAS #FTSE #AIM
4233 2018-06-15 21:43:41 Do you have a robotic leg ? Maybe you need to give your leg an oil change
4234 2018-06-15 21:43:33 Eh
4235 2018-06-15 21:43:31 Motor Oil
4236 2018-06-15 21:43:25 As for Trump winning the election. Trump won because there's a sucker born everyday and people bought into snake oil sales pitch.

I've known people like Trump, who'd sell their mother if it meant they can make a good profit. I tend to stir clear from those types of individuals.
4237 2018-06-15 21:43:23 Time for an oil change... oooh, lordy! ＼(＾O＾)／
4238 2018-06-15 21:43:06 Well is the kid still around? You can eat it too after that oil can...
4239 2018-06-15 21:42:57 This reminds me of wrestlemania when they would jump off the top rope to do a body slam  back in the macho man and hulk hogan days
4240 2018-06-15 21:42:53 the oil change been done for about 20 minutes.. i been waiting to pay since then
4241 2018-06-15 21:42:47 Just earlier, I applied oil onto my sword so it has great sharpness. If you touch it even slightly, your fingers would be cut and blood could spill.
4242 2018-06-15 21:42:27 @cdrammeh2003 Hey Cameron my names Ed im 55 years old.. I Just see a video your mum put up on you tube and it distressed me so much so that ive joined Twitter to find you as ive got some oil that i think might be able to help you with your seizures.Let me send you a free sample?
4243 2018-06-15 21:42:26 thats why Israels neighbours need to stand up and be counted instead of cowering under the threat of US sanctions they have the power of Oil behind them #BDS
4244 2018-06-15 21:42:23 Typical. The NDP policies cause massive economical problems in the province, it’s not the NDP’s fault, it’s global oil prices. Klein brings prosperity to the province, it wasn’t him, it was global oil prices.
4245 2018-06-15 21:42:23 Guess who just got hot frying oil all over her hand 30 minute into her shift. 
4246 2018-06-15 21:42:14 Smooth shot, great sight. Did you get the target light?
4247 2018-06-15 21:42:12 @Trimechanics would you bother with olive oil at all or go straight for organic EVOO for eating and cooking?
4248 2018-06-15 21:42:04 @sajidjavid needs to intervene with regards to Billy Caldwell, the boy who may not survive due to his severe epilepsy. His mother was stopped at Heathrow with cannabis oil to treat him and in turn had it confiscated. Truly awful situation!
4249 2018-06-15 21:42:03 You know this but the SDNY couldnt find find the link ?? Trump is nothing more than a snake oil salesman, he manages to brainwash a bunch of group of ppl. Its funny as shit !!
4250 2018-06-15 21:41:51 If you look at a $1 bill closely, you’ll see it’s covered in reptiles!  Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
4251 2018-06-15 21:41:27 Gamma Ray > Neck Oil.
4252 2018-06-15 21:41:25 Joss sticks and patchouli oil. And whatever exotic fragrance Pete Burns was sporting.
4253 2018-06-15 21:41:18 God. Ew.  
That’d be like drinking oil. No thanks. 
4254 2018-06-15 21:41:16 "And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them." ~Mark 6:13 #Jesus #God #Bible
4255 2018-06-15 21:41:12 A "snake oil salesman" for crypto currencies...pumping BITCOIN at $19,000+. Viewers who bought into that are down almost 70%!
4256 2018-06-15 21:41:11 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. New York City sleeps.
4257 2018-06-15 21:41:11 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Pittsburgh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
4258 2018-06-15 21:40:58 of oil consumption tests. They over course diagnose the car with the problem and now they’re saying I’m past the warranty date so they don’t plan on covering the costs. I was a loyal customer when I was promoting their brand to my family and friends but now that it is time
4259 2018-06-15 21:40:58 1972 ? Ford LTD Station Wagon with speed inspired paint job towed out of garage after 30 years of storage. Wheels were locked up and wagon wedged in garage door. Tow truck blew its hydraulics and left quarts of oil all over the alley, a hot mess !
4260 2018-06-15 21:40:41 But it is entwined with oil water and natural gas.
4261 2018-06-15 21:40:33 The man has been applauded for putting snake oil... in space...! (Anyone other than this 21st Century Barnum would have been arrested for fly-tipping.)
Even the smart money taking time to see Emperor's new snake oil for what it is.
But it will.......

4267 2018-06-15 21:39:32 they keep telling me that my car was consuming oil but it was not a common problem. My dad told me that I needed to research the problem and boom it’s all over the web. I follow up with them and now all of a sudden they’re aware of the problem and need to perform another series
4268 2018-06-15 21:39:32 Aku grapeseed oil.
4269 2018-06-15 21:39:28 He was in the olive oil business with his father, but that was a long time ago?

4271 2018-06-15 21:39:01 a wise man once said that when DT talks the 'truth', Jesus dreams about being a #Democrat

4273 2018-06-15 21:37:54 All you have to do is keep The Way of Happiness flowing in the society. Like a gentle oil spread upon the raging sea, the calm will flow outward and outward. #MaineSingsWithBWBoys #ALDUB35thMonthsary
4274 2018-06-15 21:37:41 I know you’re a bit of a wheels the conqueror but you replied to me first. Do go get an oil change and #stfu
4275 2018-06-15 21:37:35 @amyhollyfield ran for the Oval Office...speaking at an EIGHTH grade graduation.....priceless.

4277 2018-06-15 21:37:17 Need to oil and comb my hair buuut the way my body set up today . . .
4278 2018-06-15 21:37:16 It would still be tough for an independent Scotland, for the same ressons given during the Referendum (small population, difficult infrastructure, oil running out, small, unhealthy & ageing workforce etc. But a lot of high-value exports & expertise too. Worth a go, Id say.

Oil on canvas, and tusche and pencil on paper
4284 2018-06-15 21:36:46 Y’all buy synthetic oil?
4285 2018-06-15 21:36:42 we can't even get the Department of interior to collect billions of dollars in oil royalties from oil companies that are Awash in cash. Meanwhile, precious water is being wasted by frackers to extract natural gas from public lands. Will miss the water more, in the end.

4287 2018-06-15 21:35:48 Check my tl,plus I luv ur avi
4288 2018-06-15 21:35:44 @NickHurdUK Are you going to let Billy receive the cannabis oil he needs to save his life or are you heartless and cruel? Just think if it was your child!
4289 2018-06-15 21:35:38 Feeling super grateful for the person that paid for my oil change bc my bank blocked my card for no reason  we need more people like you in this world!!
4290 2018-06-15 21:35:35 Mmm, melted fat.  Hey, it’s a better use than lamp oil! 
4291 2018-06-15 21:35:17 Monat. it's expensive tho. but it has this rejuvinuiqe oil which is like used by professionals and if you buy like a tiny dropper bottle of the oil by itself it's like 40 dollars
4292 2018-06-15 21:35:14 Tune up, my brakes fixed, oil change and my window fixed. S/o to a real one 
4293 2018-06-15 21:35:14 Wallahi e no even open shop today
4294 2018-06-15 21:35:10 This week was a macro commodity unwinding. The commodity markets and broad general are losing faith in demand exciting supply across lumber oil gold silver platinum gasoline heating oil Palladium
4295 2018-06-15 21:35:04 Fascinating. 
Of course Russian firms are sanctioned from acquiring shale technology and without oil prices being about $100 per barrel the Arctic reserves are logically left, whilst possibly expanding into the Middle East. Who would have thought a Saudi-Russian deal might happen
4296 2018-06-15 21:34:51 Detox sounds like something involving snake oil and coffee enemas. Medically supervised withdrawal sounds good (MSWs in the audience can disagree I guess).
4297 2018-06-15 21:34:47 The convenience of an oil pen is soooooo clutch I could literally get cooked anywhere incognegro style
4298 2018-06-15 21:34:46 Does baby oil actually take off tan or have a wasted 15 minutes Latherin masel In slime
4299 2018-06-15 21:34:43 Can you imagine OPEC saying such a thing about oil?
4300 2018-06-15 21:34:39 Maybe so @NestleCerealsUK but are you using sustainable palm oil.....I think not!!!!
4301 2018-06-15 21:34:37 My decoder ring is in the shop, what the hell did you just say?
4302 2018-06-15 21:34:17 Give the oil company some credit.  Deserved.
4303 2018-06-15 21:34:06 Trying to get a oil change right now feel impossible
4304 2018-06-15 21:33:55 "The best engine in the world is the vagina.

It can be started with one finger.

It is self-lubricating.

It takes any size piston.

And it changes its own oil every four weeks.

It is only a pity that the management system is so temperamental."

Says it's all
4305 2018-06-15 21:33:48 Whale oil?????   That went out during the Victorian Era...
4306 2018-06-15 21:33:40 Or a sexy Cuban girl (redundant I know.)
4307 2018-06-15 21:33:29 That means no more drilling for gas or oil and ramp up our wind and solar energy resources
4308 2018-06-15 21:33:18 The smell of lavender helps alot to ease stress and anxiety levels. Either oil in a bath or a plant. Plants help more cause it's constantly in the air. I hope this helps!
4309 2018-06-15 21:33:18 Bloody disgusting.
Yemen doesn't have oil reserves, am I right?
So this is just Saudi flexing its arm in the region.
Meanwhile, The West sits back an allows it
Irrespective of technical support - every country has a right to defend itself - BUT this is outrageous ATTACK...
4310 2018-06-15 21:33:02 Give the cannabis oil before it’s to late!!!! Now
4311 2018-06-15 21:32:45 Oil industries won't survive without subsidies
4312 2018-06-15 21:32:39 Fuck sake it’s not even 11 and I’m talking to Chubb and tia about how 9/11 was a planned attack so America could invade countries to rob them of their oil
4313 2018-06-15 21:32:37 Because he is de-regulating every regulation Obama put in place. Making our water unsafe, air dirty, spewing dirt out of the tailpipes of cars - all for gas & oil co's. $$$ and taking out Obama. THAT is what Trump wants. Eliminate Obama. No care about the planet.
4314 2018-06-15 21:32:31 John, you're being silly.
Most of the $3 billion will flow through to consumers who buy gas, oil and electricity.
The consumers were aware of the charges - and voted accordingly.

4316 2018-06-15 21:32:13 Do the Medical Marijuana and Herbs like ginger, rosemary, Pinnapple. What is it called CBD OIL?
4317 2018-06-15 21:31:54 FANTASTIC idea from Josh Convert of St. Louis: these Sharpie markers use oil pigment and look AMAZING covering the various edges of cardboard in this game!
4318 2018-06-15 21:31:50 MEDICAL POLL:

CAPSAICIN OR CHILI OIL OR RUBBING CHILI PEPPER ON YOUR GENITALS?
4319 2018-06-15 21:31:38 @theresa_may You r without a doubt truly disgusting to confiscate the medicine that will save that boys life. Meanwhile I have been told that your husband invests heavily in the company that produces the oil you call illegal. You r a hypocrite and should rot in hell for this.
4320 2018-06-15 21:31:23 for my CBD oil I just use a standard vape kit (Vaporesso Swag (I fucking hate the name)) with a cermanic coil.

Works pretty darn well and battery lasts for ever because the ceramic coil uses less power.
4321 2018-06-15 21:31:20 Massage a few drops of coconut oil around the eyes to get rid off dark circles.
4322 2018-06-15 21:30:59 Mxm damn now that baby oil pic makes sense! 
4323 2018-06-15 21:30:56 If you want to be super shocked she just argued about the price of her oil change 
4324 2018-06-15 21:30:52 Anyone good oil tycoon investors!
Please give me money!
4325 2018-06-15 21:30:49 Where can i get original bio oil in Nigeria?
4326 2018-06-15 21:30:24 WhT bill, give back the cannabis oil
4327 2018-06-15 21:30:18 You're just breaking my heart. Don't let that suntan oil get in your eyes.
4328 2018-06-15 21:30:17 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。
4329 2018-06-15 21:30:14 Unless everyone grasps the importance of having only two children per couple, wars won't be over just oil anymore, they will be over water and food.
4330 2018-06-15 21:30:13 Overnight lows in the 30s with scattered fixed oil allergy Olive oil allergy Arachis oil allergy Castor oil allergy Glycero
4331 2018-06-15 21:30:13 Annoiting oil would be the preferred guess.
4332 2018-06-15 21:30:12 YESSSS THAT SOUNDS AMAZING my mom the oil steeping thing and it is for real 
4333 2018-06-15 21:29:53 Oil and miners
4334 2018-06-15 21:29:49 Going in for an oil change for $65 and walk away having spent $600+ ON GOD KNOWS WHAT. I’m about to change my career to be a mechanic to avoid this nonsense entirely.
4335 2018-06-15 21:29:47 Problem is, by flying to Canada for it, instead of just going to 1000+ reputable people in the UK, she's got her medicine seized and now is refusing anyone's help, loads wanna give her the oil but she won't accept it. It's unfair on the kid the way she's acted n the government.
4336 2018-06-15 21:29:30 @theresa_may Sort Billy Caldwell's cannabis oil medicine out now
4337 2018-06-15 21:29:28 “Why” is a good question... does Yemen pose any threat to Israel?  Or do we want their oil?
4338 2018-06-15 21:29:23 Small cars! Electric cars! Carpools! Transit! Subway! Bilking solar panels. Use all of the above to use less oil & gas!
4339 2018-06-15 21:29:11 No. He’s the only fisherman on the entire island. In Jaws 2, Chief Brody is the only guy on the island with any experience. Otherwise somebody else would have done something. He sells Whale Oil aka a loser.
4340 2018-06-15 21:28:52 land/water/oil rigg grab
4341 2018-06-15 21:28:43 My request give back oil now
4342 2018-06-15 21:28:43 I have a lemon-olive oil cake where I rub the sugar with lemon zest to pull the oils out and I steep the oil oil with lemon zest for even more lemony goodness. I love citrus desserts, like citrus > chocolate for me any day.
4343 2018-06-15 21:28:33 Add a lil oil to the pan
4344 2018-06-15 21:28:17 All ppl claiming we don't need a wall and Mexico/S.A. such a great place, should take the family on road trip to Guatemala. Get in the Escalade and drive. 
4345 2018-06-15 21:28:16 Have you tried evening primrose oil Leslie? I know it sounds trite, but it got me off anti-depressants.
4346 2018-06-15 21:28:14 I JUST DROPPED AN ENTIRE CAN OF OIL ON THE FUCKING FLOOR AND AS I WAS GOING GO WIPE IT I SLIPPED IN IT  why the f*ck am i this dumb
4347 2018-06-15 21:27:55 Ronald cuando estan de nuevo para la venta wild oregano oil and Azufre Organico? -Bendiciones para ti y tu flia.
4348 2018-06-15 21:27:46 Give back the cannabis oil before he dies
4349 2018-06-15 21:27:33 What is it then? Is the oil there or not? Does England wants to keep it even though is losing revenew, apparentely?  The North sea Oil rig is in Scotland territory, wouldn't it be a part of and independent Scotland when the UK splits? I
4350 2018-06-15 21:27:27 And the sign of accepted #Ramadan is Continuous good deeds after it.
4351 2018-06-15 21:27:18 You dummy, our oil is more expensive to extract, when it is expensive, it is actually good for our oil companies.
4352 2018-06-15 21:27:07 Effects are overstated. Oil demand won’t go down for atleast 50-60 years.

Otherwise global powers would not be playing war games for oil in Middle East.
4353 2018-06-15 21:27:01 hi,  I have a conformable crude oil allocation for sale right now. DM me if you have capable off takers.
4354 2018-06-15 21:26:46 Can you give the cannabis oil back before he dies
4355 2018-06-15 21:26:21 The world is full of governments wanting to use starvation as a control method of control.     Ehh how many foodbanks does this oil rich country have.  #westmonster
4356 2018-06-15 21:26:09 I don’t like Dead Pony Club much. Like Neck Oil but yes prefer those other two. Neck Oil a decent session beer though.
4357 2018-06-15 21:26:08 And I counted three @SecretService agents protecting her from those armed little hooligans. 

Those agents are worthy of trust and confidence. 

Hilary ain’t.
4358 2018-06-15 21:26:00 We have bog myrtle on the hill, but I can't get to it sadly, so I just purchase the oil. But I'm an aromatherapist, so kinda an addict anyway ( essential oils)
4359 2018-06-15 21:25:51 Baby oil surely? You watching this year? @fxkyey watched it last year
4360 2018-06-15 21:25:40 Got an oil change, tires rotated, and a car wash all at no charge. It was my first oil change with this car so it was free. And car washes are always free. @CampbellFord takes care of their customers. 
4361 2018-06-15 21:25:39 O ro ro oil dey ur head

4362 2018-06-15 21:25:39 Caught up to the end of s5 in voltron and only JUST now realized that the whole thing is a metaphor for American imperialism and oil wars.
4363 2018-06-15 21:25:19 So I have to get new tire a new belt and an oil change and this is my dads response
4364 2018-06-15 21:24:40 Oil is such a terrible burden on Scotland
4365 2018-06-15 21:24:38 Till u hype me 
4366 2018-06-15 21:24:36 Yay for spending $430 on new breaks and rotors and an oil change 
4367 2018-06-15 21:24:15 U go and get a oil change and a nigga would take your whole engine out saying something wrong
4368 2018-06-15 21:24:12 @quinnmichaels you may also want to look in2 Huntington Gardens in Pasadena/San Marino; old robber baron $ (railroads/water/oil); various gardens, a museum, a library, a gift shop
4369 2018-06-15 21:24:10 Pretty sure that medical knowledge isn't in the book he reads from to all a sports talk show. He reads THAT book to Doctor Oz at the snake oil salesmen annual awards dinner.
4370 2018-06-15 21:24:10 Scotland has pesky oil, which makes it difficult
4371 2018-06-15 21:23:56 My roommate’s new thing is using olive oil instead of shaving cream because it supposedly gives a better shave but I think she actually is just trying to kill me by greasing up the shower 
4372 2018-06-15 21:23:53 Shrink acne by placing a wrapped ice cube on it and leave it on the pimple for 3 minutes. Then cover it with a dab of lavender oil.
4373 2018-06-15 21:23:47 Pushing five bottles of alcohol to the side to grab grape seed oil cause cooking with butter is unhealthy
4374 2018-06-15 21:23:47 It’d be LIT AF. Take the US Marines about 6 months to ferret out the cartels, everyone else would become US Citizens and all those tourist and manufacturing jobs would be American jobs again. They have oil and a wall on their Southern border.
4375 2018-06-15 21:23:46 Y’all ever burned your scalp with hot oil? I just did. This must be what Michael Jackson felt like.
4376 2018-06-15 21:23:45 Want a trick to stop eating mayo just make some fresh mayo. Starts preparation: All this is is egg and oil. Why am I eating this...
4377 2018-06-15 21:23:25 Thank you!  1--The trial is pretty hard for me--but I am motivated.  I installed a reverse osmosis filter and a handheld shower head.  I gave up my daily long baths for full-body oil cleansing and just washing my hair separately and a quick once over of groin, feet and armpits.
4378 2018-06-15 21:23:17 Used a bit of coconut oil and now feel like the queen of self care
4379 2018-06-15 21:23:13 Zionists are using Jewish aggression in Palestine to stoke a war between Isreal and with whatever Islamic country Zionists decide is next to destroy.
Its Iran.
They've no Rothchild Central Bank.
They don't buy/sell oil in Petrodollars.
They are next on the map of greater Isreal.
4380 2018-06-15 21:23:03 Nice talking points. What is your plan? Do you want to ration oil? What’s the plan?
4381 2018-06-15 21:22:59 Most importantly @SOPHIEMSMSMSM  Oil of every pearls un-insides!!!!!!! The trans icon!
4382 2018-06-15 21:22:55 @C60redlion Hello I was Told Last Week That my 2 Liters of your NEWEST Improved C60 In Olive oil would be done this week. Now I get No answers to emails and do not even know if my product was shipped. What is going on? Thank You

4393 2018-06-15 21:20:38 They are!! I was so worried they’d taste funky but the spice combo is so good on it, and since they’re oil free they’re not really unhealthy either!

4399 2018-06-15 21:20:11 Every time I see a new #luxury #resort put up on a beautiful island I think of how far we have strayed from a #sustainable #lifestyle that might lessen #globalwarming. The #US is exporting more #oil now than #SaudiArabia!! And we were supposed to have run out...
4400 2018-06-15 21:19:59 I was 16 days overdue in the end and nothing worked for me. Curries. Olive oil. Sex. Brisk walks. Exercise. Nothing. Apart from an emergency c section..lol
4401 2018-06-15 21:19:48 Sometimes we lose sight of what's important. In contrast [to trees and fish], oil, metals, and coal are not renewable; they don't reproduce, sprout, or have sex to produce baby oil droplets or coal nuggets. It's a finite resource. When it's gone. That's it!

He'll either get given an oil well for his honesty or handcuffed to a radiator for 20 yrs like Terry Waite

4415 2018-06-15 21:17:45 You're seriously unaware that the U.S. produces steel, seafood, oil and textiles?  Would you like me to tell you specifically where in the U.S. it all comes from?  We do import a lot of those things, but only because we choose to do so while selling what we produce at home
4416 2018-06-15 21:17:42 Fun Fact: @NutellaGlobal use a lot of palm oil in their sugar spread (I mean hazelnut spread)

Thoughts on dogs with hip and joint problems?  My poor baby has such a hard time with her hips and I’d like to know if CBD oil may help.

4465 2018-06-15 21:09:36 I'm not sure what kind of Regulation would effectively substitute for that.
We could prohibit any additional oil sands development, but the costs to us are astronomical and it certainly wouldn't lead to a one for one reduction in emissions.
4466 2018-06-15 21:09:36 S Korea has no oil either and to save energy the first floor of office buildings often have no heat at all, this likely happens in Japan too. When it comes to not wasting energy, SK and Japan are really really serious.

4503 2018-06-15 21:04:21 Our oil industry is entering the 3rd stage of growth, with local firms (Cahill, Pennecon), now with decades of experience, beginning to export to other jurisdictions - bringing capital into the Prov like never before. This in addition to our own continued local production...

4525 2018-06-15 21:01:46 Oil producing does not mean oil refining (or oil products).

The "oil products" coming in are refined oil products, not crude oil (i.e. what you labelled as "oil producing").

An economy demanding more refined oil products is one with growing economic activities.

4553 2018-06-15 20:58:39 You can help by really carefully checking if products have Palm Oil in them, there are sustainable options but it’s still up for debate on whether that’s helpful or not, like unless they are growing their own on a farm or body of land I assume it’s still Orangutans homes!
4554 2018-06-15 20:58:38 Yes, the federal government would actually pursue a national unity objective in building a national pipeline (with refineries in Alberta for heavy crude and the refined product displacing foreign oil). Far better than the enormously divisive Transmountain expansion.

4558 2018-06-15 20:58:21 Subsidies are a very vague description, could be tax breaks or research and development which could one day make burning oil much cleaner and efficient. Not fair to single out one sector when so many others get the same "subsidies "
4559 2018-06-15 20:57:52 Just got a free oil change and inspection 
4560 2018-06-15 20:57:36 Hey bby. How about you grab that motor oil gurl. @RaineSN7
4561 2018-06-15 20:57:27 Oil is heavily subsidized. Let’s remove the subsidies too.
4562 2018-06-15 20:57:15 Think some of the oil leaked out my pen and I licked it I feel like I’m finna die
4563 2018-06-15 20:57:03 @LimitedHangOut1 q le paso al.oil hoy la subida de las fed ??
4564 2018-06-15 20:56:57 Yet jobs were on the way up during the time those lifesaving regulations were in effect.  You removed the regulation requiring a blowout preventer on oil wells.  That deregulation alone will get American workers killed and you know it.
4565 2018-06-15 20:56:27 Liiiiiil bit of Olive oil. ;)
4566 2018-06-15 20:56:24 Hi @imsonotahippy l would love to hear more about how you make use of #neam oil. Luckily I got some for £1 at a car boot sale. Thank you @Simoncitizen

4571 2018-06-15 20:55:38 The elites know what is best for us - or so they think.

Question - why does gender, intersectionality etc. matter so much re:NAFTA when it matters not at all when it comes to where we buy the oil from that would have been displaced by Energy East oil?

4577 2018-06-15 20:54:25 " It tastes like someone mixed soy sauce, fermented fish sauce and used motor oil and boiled it down into a thick sludge."

Maybe they just didn't use the correct portions of each in the batch you got!? Also, "Vegemite fountain" 
4578 2018-06-15 20:54:10 Thanks for this. You've just reminded me that I need to buy some oil this weekend.

4582 2018-06-15 20:53:04 No, just to add moisture. There are eggs but no flour. Ground almonds instead. It’s heralded as healthier but a lot of coconut oil in it. Fun to try but now to find people to eat it. Going to a kid’s party tomorrow, might try distribute it amongst unsuspecting choc lovers 
4583 2018-06-15 20:52:55 US supported him in that until we decided he needed to go, not because of his heinous acts but because we wanted Libyan oil
4584 2018-06-15 20:52:25 Your votes in Congress bely your interest in advancing education; and, other than the oil & gas industry and the tea party, you have never worked closely with anything while in Congress.  You only say what you think people want to hear & once in office, ignore us

4616 2018-06-15 20:48:36 Brilliant idea: we should shut down most of the oil and gas sector and force the rest into a cartel to serve domestic needs only. It's a volatile sector, after all!

4619 2018-06-15 20:48:10 There is no long term vision. Just more of the same. Ramping up immigration. Overpopulation. Destruction of habitat. Extinctions. Climate change. Flooding.

4624 2018-06-15 20:47:27 The #socialmedia propaganda keeps going on about how #Israel left #Gaza with buildings & greenhouses! Really? So, why destroy it all in 2014? Could it be that had to happen because of the oil & gas found off the #Gazan coast, which #Israel wanted for itself not for #Hamas?
4625 2018-06-15 20:47:22 And OIL! mye, mye olje.
Men ellers, ikke så mye

4630 2018-06-15 20:47:06 Voters do not matter to @realDonaldTrump and his flunkies. What matters is the oil companies and what they want.
4631 2018-06-15 20:47:06 SEN. what don't you understand? He's in the oil lobby pocket. Damn you guys really are not the sharpest knives in the drawer. Ethanol puts big oil out of business.  Duh..!!
4632 2018-06-15 20:46:44 However the eco-anarchists only believe in purity of thought. “Oil must face its future as a declining industry” tweets Tzeporah Berman. Obviously emerging economies will be granola dependent for their energy needs. Granola is a renewable product shipped in Aframax class vessels.

4640 2018-06-15 20:45:07 I need to book myself in for one and stop suffering sha. I need better regime whenever I overuse my oil.
4641 2018-06-15 20:45:04 Last time I checked there were no deaths as a result of a pipeline, same can not be said about transporting oil by rail.
4642 2018-06-15 20:45:03 Father’s Day ads : “get him that scotch and beard oil he’s always wanted!” Uhmm whose hipster dad is that ad directed at??? Renew his Costco membership and get him a Fat Franks dog

4644 2018-06-15 20:44:36 Didn't know much myself. Hated the stuff even, had panic attacks of it ages ago. 2 years of dosing oil every night, I now have a good tolerance and can dose as and when needed. Currently burning though £30 worth a night. Costly staying alive, illegally!
4645 2018-06-15 20:44:26 Plenty like what can we do with all that oil money

A treasonous lying bastard taking credit for Obama's economy before he tanks it into the ground with tariffs and jacked oil prices.
4648 2018-06-15 20:44:06 You don't need to use the plant. The oil is produced with out the active drug. You can grow it with out the drug if you want.

4653 2018-06-15 20:43:21 5. Dredge in dry mix, shake of excess
6. Gently lower into 170 degree frying oil until golden brown, chicken is thin enough from tenderising that it will be cooked through by that time.
7. Move to wire rack to dry 
8. It’s too juicy wow
4654 2018-06-15 20:43:10 Need an oil change and a new battery. Sheesh
4655 2018-06-15 20:43:03 It’s not zero sum. Expanding our ability to get a vital resource to market (a market that will demand oil for decades, whether outs or not) will enrich our country. That allows us to invest in our economy, renewables, soicil programs. Why does KM need be stopped to pursue that?
4656 2018-06-15 20:43:00 I am an odd human being, I don’t like how the oil shines on the cheese 
4657 2018-06-15 20:42:56 I would think so, yes.

4662 2018-06-15 20:41:46 You ever look into the Oil Depletion Allowance?
4663 2018-06-15 20:41:41 It's cruel to deprive this boy or anyone who needs cannabis oil as medication, time it was made legal, it obviously works, feel so sorry for the mum having to see her son suffering when it could be easily avoided @theresa_may
4664 2018-06-15 20:41:36 @DCDPW re cooking oil disposal, do I have to leave my container or can I bring a reusable one?
4665 2018-06-15 20:41:35 Just ordered some vape oil only size available is 100mil for comparison a "vape oil bottle" is 10mil, end up smoking it eating in my kornflakes... Smoking it. It's actually quite cheap taking in consideration of the normal vape oil you world smoke. diping it into our chips.
4666 2018-06-15 20:41:33 Lay off the kool aid. The US military can go fight for oil elsewhere

4671 2018-06-15 20:40:49 Work with that country to help them make it a place their people want 2 live in. I've been to Mexico many times & the poverty there is just sad. Why doesn't America help them instead of spending so much money 2 protect countries we shouldn't b involved in if it weren't 4 the oil!
4672 2018-06-15 20:40:40 It can come in many forms. Like oil barons who deny climate change, charge tariffs for solar panels and nix mass transit infrastructure improvements so that we have to pay them for energy.
4673 2018-06-15 20:40:37 If instead of invading Poland or Netherlands, Hitler just invaded in Middle East and took the oil. If instead of publically demonizing Jews, he said "We Nazis love Jews - we will be improving life for you any day now!" and accused Dem Socialists of being anti-Semites.

4680 2018-06-15 20:40:01 Not entirely true, all you need is a firm brush & water with coconut oil, conditioner and tea tree oil. Then you can resurrect those locks my loves

4838 2018-06-15 20:19:21 Figured since @dailydairydiary got an oil change I probably should as well.... I got scolded by them too.... way over due!

4843 2018-06-15 20:18:32 Holy crap.
4844 2018-06-15 20:18:31  We need to look beyond Oil and Gas.
4845 2018-06-15 20:18:08 I've watched sport from 9am - 9pm today. 2 NRL games, then 3 World Cup games with horse races filling the gaps. I've piled through an oil tanker's worth of tea, an enormous pile of biscuits, a large tikka karahi, an avalanche of samosas, 3 slices brown toast (Fibre!), and 1 beer
4846 2018-06-15 20:18:07 No one wishes houthis and will never allow them again to destroy our country. no salaries for three years,huge hike in price,shortage of oil,absence of service,outbreak of medieval disease.All crimes are done by houthi terrorist militia, promoting Jihad and inciting violence
4847 2018-06-15 20:18:02 I see there's a big drop in the price of oil today, I'm sure these companies will be passing on the reduction in prices at the petrol pumps as quick as they rise them when the oil price goes up.

4852 2018-06-15 20:17:36 I can't prescribe meds obliviously, but I do suggest you look into CBD Oil. I have been using it for about 2 - 3 weeks with quite a bit of pain relief. I get mine on Amazon (like damn near everything else)
4853 2018-06-15 20:17:29 If a Shudra (lowest caste member) dares to give moral lessons to a Brahmin, the king is to get him punished by pouring hot oil in his ear and mouth. (Manusmriti, VII: 272)
4854 2018-06-15 20:17:26 Hi @broightergold is there anywhere in the Limavady/Myroe area I can buy a 5L carton of oil? We're going for a hike along the sea wall tomorrow :)

4863 2018-06-15 20:16:12 At #JiffyLube, need oil change, went to use washroom. Looked around at all the little mirrors on the wall, I decided I’ll wait! I’m always thinking there might be hidden cameras  WATCHING  didn't have to use it that bad 
I'll wait
4864 2018-06-15 20:16:09 Yes..called CBD oil contains both THC and CBD...which is illegal...
It's down to the purity i think...
It has to be very pure...made up.. 
I would like it for my own son...he fits daily...and gas status epilepticus.. 
Maybe one day...
4865 2018-06-15 20:16:09 Aye right. Lot of men heading for the rigs - I had lunch with some oil men the other day. Horse's mouth is best. Scotland's the only country in UK that can feed its population, provide fuel & power & still export them. Reckon we'll manage. Especially with own immigration policy.
4866 2018-06-15 20:16:05 5Keep your brows natural and use castor oil to grow them out.
4867 2018-06-15 20:15:56 Get an oil burner and bog myrtle essential oil, or lemongrass. They hate it
4868 2018-06-15 20:15:53 Baby oil 
4869 2018-06-15 20:15:30 it's paysage size #3 which means it's approx 27 cm x 19 cm (W x H) 
so about 12 in x 7 in ? and it's on canvas with a wood frame
are you buying a fucking oil painting
4870 2018-06-15 20:15:20 I bet hes not the oil lying one not washing his hands
4871 2018-06-15 20:15:17 I wish I could like this 1000000 times bc of how true this is. He must get a good hot oil treatment
4872 2018-06-15 20:14:58 Trailer sales or maybe just rentals may have increased, but hey, now we have to pay more for aluminum and steel. But he couldn't pick this fight when it counted keeping oil lines from being built through Native American lands.
4873 2018-06-15 20:14:54 My job: here are 32 journals to manage 
Me: I still call my dad when the guy at the car shop tries to tell me I need more than an oil change
4874 2018-06-15 20:14:48 Nice. You know it’s Imperial Stout when it looks like motor oil.

4877 2018-06-15 20:14:06 Someone get me a pen that got THC oil in it ... I bet I be high as cootie brown 24/7
4878 2018-06-15 20:14:01 Mexico should construct pipelines and export oil and natural gas to U.S. to make North America more  energy independent. America needs consistent trade talks with allies and China to expand trade and jobs, not tariffs, because they lead to more tariffs and harm relations.
4879 2018-06-15 20:14:01 shower thoughts lmao
4880 2018-06-15 20:13:58 Work in the oil industry and I can tell you, for what I see in our work environment, racism or anything remotely associated with it, is almost nonexistent. It’s Mexicans, Blacks, Whites, Asians, etc. and we all get along just fine towards the same goal, a safe/productive project.

4887 2018-06-15 20:13:01 I don’t think so...kind of a social outcast deal if I recall. Dodgy relics, snake oil and sin eating.
4888 2018-06-15 20:12:57 @davidhealyv was looking into the cross border aspects of oil and gas licensing - fracking and offshore? I'll have to have a proper chat with you next week James. Hope you're keeping well with all the brilliant work you and Aisling Cowan are doing!
4889 2018-06-15 20:12:40 Goats cheese popcorn in Derby is not a culinary phenomenon. It tastes of rancid oil and is quite possibly the nastiest thing I've ever tasted unless Katie Hopkins ever asks me to suck her marathon sock
4890 2018-06-15 20:12:39 Al Jazeera and Camels. Both great... But I stil love the oil more
4891 2018-06-15 20:12:39 I love working 8 hours then driving in traffic for 40 mins just to be 20 mins late to my oil change apt :’)

4895 2018-06-15 20:11:49 Wasn't failed it was a conspiracy by the oil companies. 
4896 2018-06-15 20:11:48 Disgraceful.  Give him the cannabis oil .

4899 2018-06-15 20:11:13 Politicians must understand the unconscious mind,  it's what drives us when we are not alert and we can't be alert 24x7. It would take too much energy to be.  Empathy awakens the unconscious mind.  Politicians need to know that Empathy is the new oil.
4900 2018-06-15 20:11:10 Mephiston red with gloss varnish over a B&W undershading, then pure black airbrushed into recesses followed by more varnish and an 'starship filth' oil wash :)
4901 2018-06-15 20:10:50 That was the same for me, I really understand ;;
But you can ask your dentist to explain what he does if that helps for the fear of tools (that helped for me...also bc I had closed my eyes haha)
And for the smell maybe put some essential oil under your nose before ? It'll be ok !
4902 2018-06-15 20:10:41 Sadly,Krosh politicians have a considerable history of discounting the future when it comes to our natural resources and environment. Gas, Oil, zinc, fisheries....
4903 2018-06-15 20:10:29 I was disappointed to see the NZ Government politicise energy policy by banning new offshore oil and gas exploration in the manner it did. This politicises the issue and undermines the role of the Climate Commission too.
4904 2018-06-15 20:10:21 Lemme understand first. What you need is that oil used in making the ofe akwụ right?

4912 2018-06-15 20:09:41 ...you are aware MBTI is extemely unscientific right? defending this as an MBTI professional is like defending it as a professional snake oil salesperson

4914 2018-06-15 20:09:33 I mean I’m down.  I fly home tomorrow and my suitcase is packed with cheese, olive oil, and wine
4915 2018-06-15 20:09:33 @LiamFox,  what a lot of people don’t understand is that Norway’s northern/Arctic oil&gas fields are as close to Aberdeen as they are to Stavanger.
4916 2018-06-15 20:09:29 If corn oil is made from corn and vegetable oil is made from vegetables. What is baby oil made from?

4918 2018-06-15 20:09:10 im about to take my car to jiffy lube like y’all can take the oil back i don’t want the oil change anymore that oil change was my light bill money no cap
4919 2018-06-15 20:09:01 Work truck gets an oil change just about once a month and everyone at the oil change place already knows me. They offered me a soda or a water today and some chips 
4920 2018-06-15 20:08:41 Heck, even try Calgary. Some decent oil money action up there and it’s a vacation (Banff) while making $$.
4921 2018-06-15 20:08:35 I’ve been saying for some time,that the squeaky wheel gets the oil.The Repubs have been squealing at DOJ,about HRC for the past 10yrs.That has served them well. As @Comey decided to go out of his way to prove to the squealing R’s that he wasn’t doing HRC any favors.
4922 2018-06-15 20:08:34 @BuffaloVapor Has anyone tried CBD oil for pain management?
4923 2018-06-15 20:08:33 Well, a bumpy week in the markets due to multiple reasons with Trade Wars not helping any.  Crude Oil is down to $64.  Metals are struggling (trade wars) but I'm very hopeful that regardless of political tensions, that corporations will continue to be profitable.
Stay Diversified
4924 2018-06-15 20:08:31 coconut oil is magic
4925 2018-06-15 20:08:09 And what exactly is a “disgrace” to you? Because you don’t like his socks? He’s done more than Harper. They sat back and pissed away an oil boom and let companies abuse the foreign worker program.

4931 2018-06-15 20:07:46 Shame on Mr. Hurd.  What does the Home Office think will happen to Billy Cauldwell, should he use the cannabis oil? He'll get high? Turn to hard drugs?
4932 2018-06-15 20:07:32 URGENT: Trump and Interior Secretary Zinke are rushing to open the Arctic Refuge to oil and gas drilling. Act now and stand up against any move to open the Arctic Refuge to Big Polluters!
4933 2018-06-15 20:07:28 not good but money helps tho lol need to get my oil changed on my car soon so needs doing lol xxx
4934 2018-06-15 20:07:17 Or when people think they have the answer to a problem you’ve been struggling with. Chronic psoriasis? Have you tried coconut oil? Or maybe it’s your diet...?
4935 2018-06-15 20:06:38 I thought he was gonna talk about a recent oil pipeline explosion or something... Dissapointing subject but obviously much easier to listen to than anything trump talks about
4936 2018-06-15 20:06:23 Start drilling for oil company profits in ANWR yet ?? Save your BS.
4937 2018-06-15 20:06:20 I had plans to pick up my new glasses and get an oil change. The optometrist closes early on Friday’s and everyone and their mother was getting their oil changed. Guess I’ll just head to happy hour

4940 2018-06-15 20:06:03 everythings controlled by the oil companies like i heard about this guy who invented a car that runs on water man, its fiber glass, and air cooled and it runs on water man
4941 2018-06-15 20:06:03 So trump & his GOP are all about power:
Money grabbing.
Racism
Authoritarian rule
Narcissism
Oil interests & guns
Sexual predators, like him, & male chavanists, like him, are abt power
It's always been abt power but this guy's wires are full of short circuits as resistance grows.

4950 2018-06-15 20:05:03 Hell yeah. Throw Lavar Ball into some HEB commercials and you strike oil with that.
4951 2018-06-15 20:04:43 Looks like it’s running on oil. Had this happen to me in a Peugeot 206 that had a crack in the engine allowing oil in. Even with the key out it kept running for 2 mins on the redline belching out smoke until it went pop
4952 2018-06-15 20:04:33 Shaved my legs and used coconut oil. I smell like an almond joy!
4953 2018-06-15 20:04:33 I mean, it's not bad for a greatest hits collection, but Midnight Oil's full albums are all readily available.
4954 2018-06-15 20:04:29 We could also shut off our cheap oil & hydro supply.

4958 2018-06-15 20:04:05 I believe there is far bigger impact of decreasing unemployment rate and higher oil prices than tarrifs. But these actions increase uncertanity and in fact copy the pattern of 1920s and 1930s. Trump is not alone in this.
4959 2018-06-15 20:04:03 and switching from red meat to white meat, please. or no meat at all, if possible. boycotting products w/ palm oil would be a cherry on top.
4960 2018-06-15 20:04:01 And some lovely homegrown toms in polytunnels, olive oil suppliers, can you make pasta?
4961 2018-06-15 20:03:38 News flash, both demand for oil as well as oil prices are going up not down. Explain to me how the green sector will generate the same taxes as oil does, it can't and won't and our social programs will be the first to go.
4962 2018-06-15 20:03:33 NOTE TO SELF. Don't drink chili oil, ever again.

4967 2018-06-15 20:02:12 The Arabs made their money from slaves before they became rich with oil. Look at which countries still have slaves. It was the white Christian nations that stopped the slave trade eventually. Basically the people that invented the k word, are the ones that got rich from slaves.

Aren't petroleum products still unmatched for energy density & portability?

4974 2018-06-15 20:00:58 Ronaldo on the Second Goal: "I added some oil to my boot to make the ball slippery that was why it slipped from the keeper's hands. Why do you think they call me ororo?"
4975 2018-06-15 20:00:56 Someone should tell Ronaldo what ORORO is and with visual representation of boiling oil

4977 2018-06-15 20:00:54 Need to get on this oil and float to this mall
4978 2018-06-15 20:00:54 Add the 3.3 billion that Canada pays in subsidies for oil, EVERY year. + 1 Trillion globally. Then add the cost to the environment of spills and the cost to clean them up. Then add the health costs of all the people with asthma, toxic poisoning and rare cancers. Shall I go on?

Certain insects hate being near cinnamon. These 4 things attack their breathing or sight.

4988 2018-06-15 19:59:21 There is a very strong, thick scent in my house right now, it smells like a mixture of soap and olive oil and I cannot pinpoint the exact location of its origin. I think someone is trying to assassinate me with an exotic chemical weapon.

4993 2018-06-15 19:58:35 Good, Canada has soybeans & oil. Prices will rise, though doubt there is a surplus, crops are already largely contracted for.
4994 2018-06-15 19:58:27 BS. Oil is not. 

Exported Fracked natural gas as LNG is worse for GHG emissions than coal.
4995 2018-06-15 19:58:24 HAHAHAHA I’m laughing. Some people are really sarcastic ehhhh. You make a joke about yourself then when people add more oil to the fire, you pretend to be the victim. Haiyah people be more matured leh.

Plz do my lazy ass a solid and throw them away, they’ve been there for almost a week now.
5014 2018-06-15 19:55:26 The guy at the auto place I’m at right now is explaining how his granddaughter is gay but he still loves her

5090 2018-06-15 19:48:47 well if they bought oil that shale producers hedged at $50/barrel then even with tariffs its probably cheaper than spot purchases now. But when you combine that with the new taxes on "teapots" I guess China wants to kick its indep refinery biz while its down

5106 2018-06-15 19:47:05 My God Dougie. Barrel of oil is up substantially from a year ago, Trump's insane attack on Iran nuke deal causes jitters & drives price even higher. That's causing higher pump prices not cap & trade. But I prefer a carbon tax to cap & trade so do our lungs a favour; implement one

5114 2018-06-15 19:46:22 The #resistance has an excellent model upon which to base its chances of success: the environment. Where Russia and the alt right pose a threat to democracy, oil and consumption have *destroyed* the environment. It’s been a complete failure. Have a great weekend!

5130 2018-06-15 19:44:48 where the olive oil @

5134 2018-06-15 19:43:47 .@united Our flight from Toronto to Newark gets delayed for 6 hours because of an oil leak. After getting back onboard engines were just turned off as we approached the runway. At what point do we get more than a $13 voucher for peanuts?
5135 2018-06-15 19:43:45 bruh I dropped my whole phone in oil today. like it was face down in a pot of oil. 
5136 2018-06-15 19:43:24 Need an oil change 
5137 2018-06-15 19:43:10 Hi. US resident here. Living next to Mexico is not horrible as your fear mongering trumpists make it out to be. Demeaning entire nationalities because of your bigoted beliefs isn’t a good sight
5138 2018-06-15 19:43:09 the yellow flour setting powder and the wake & bake baking oil!

5141 2018-06-15 19:42:57 Fuck this little ass coupe. $80 oil change. My mechanic needs to recover fast cause no lol
5142 2018-06-15 19:42:56 Perfectly done! Crispy on the outside and tender in the center. Plus zero oil to cook them
5143 2018-06-15 19:42:55 Must be the baby oil 
5144 2018-06-15 19:42:54 Done ; will retweet . I am furious this law hasnt been thrown out. Even the scientists say there probably isnt alot of useable oil there anyway so wtf .
5145 2018-06-15 19:42:52 Dead skin cells of the body can be removed by applying mixture of olive oil and salt. Replacing salt with granulated sugar can work too.
5146 2018-06-15 19:42:32 gfotybucks > my teenage dream ended = oil of every pearl’s un-insides >>>>>> music as a whole
5147 2018-06-15 19:42:32 I'd attribute it to AB bouncing back from the oil slowdown faster, and SK hit harder by layoffs in mining.
5148 2018-06-15 19:42:27 Then wthhh? Try coconut oil
5149 2018-06-15 19:42:11 Is this why coal is making a comeback and oil prices are rebounding? The green economy is a myth.
5150 2018-06-15 19:41:50 My coworker pmo this oil for my nails and shit really works g
5151 2018-06-15 19:41:44 Boíre black charcoal soap in the shower (so at least every other day) and coconut oil in the morning, before bed, and after a shower once your face is dry.

5154 2018-06-15 19:41:29 Ain't no dried up leaves that can give you deeper dreams than sun gazing. No essential oil gonna make you more positive than putting your back to a tree. No crystal gonna give you a stronger connection to Amma than putting your feet on/in the ground. No cheat codes to real life
5155 2018-06-15 19:41:13 What oil did you use
5156 2018-06-15 19:41:09 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
5157 2018-06-15 19:41:08 A foreign oil company only looks at this as a fine to be paid. It's not their backyard so no problem! They'll take a hit financially and make it up in another project. No accountability for damaging the Earth. @JustinTrudeau should not have bought a relic of a changing industry.

5162 2018-06-15 19:40:25 That's how I feel. When I started to support iScotland, I didn't know there was any oil left. I just thought that, if the cake was smaller, it would be shared more fairly.

5173 2018-06-15 19:39:06 Goo Gone is fantastic. Also rubbing alcohol and I heard a bit of peanut butter dabbed ( oil will take it off)
5174 2018-06-15 19:39:05 There’s two notches on the dipstick and they’re to show your levels are good. You don’t want them lower than the bottom notch. He’s also showing you the oil is clear not brown/black and dirty.  (Girl gang)
5175 2018-06-15 19:39:03 The threat assessment might change but the overall risk to the LNG trains and facilities for offshore support can easily be mitigated. Anadarko may lack experience but there are quite a few examples for oil & gas production in complex areas (e.g. Nigeria, Libya).
5176 2018-06-15 19:38:52 OIL LICENCE not renewable in #Nigeria anymore, no wonder the sudden hatred from the greedy ones... #Nigeria is not a personal company,@MBuhari is truly fighting for our (NIGERIA) future. #Buhari4SecondTerm
5177 2018-06-15 19:38:45 To avoid extremes during a cycle, @MariaEmmerich recommends 6 capsules of emu oil (GLA) per day to balance estrogen dominance.

5179 2018-06-15 19:38:42 @cnnbrk @fox @abc @nbc Oil prices for crude produced in West Texas' Permian basin have fallen off sharply over the past two months & prices at the pumps don't reflect it who's gouging the American people on #gas prices?

5189 2018-06-15 19:37:52 This is they only way the US can get rid of it's overpriced oil, that's to encourage a rise in oil prices, with oil partners. Besides the fracking gas has to complete with oil at $85.
5190 2018-06-15 19:37:51 And here’s us thinking that austerity is here till doomsday because of Broon’s gross incompetence and giving away our oil and water to little england. As the saying goes - ‘fool me once shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me’.

Copper -2.5% to 3.14 lb  $CU
5198 2018-06-15 19:36:52 There's no balance between oil companies & farms.  The gov't hits hardest against the individual farmer vs. a oil company cash cow.   People living in urban & suburbs need to start living a balanced life, too.  Seems that few want to change their ways.
5199 2018-06-15 19:36:32 I’m sorry for what you and your family are going through.  A lot of people got conned by him.  We tried to warn you but the he really did turn out to be the snake oil salesman we told he was, didn’t he?

5210 2018-06-15 19:35:23 Let’s just try and think of as many ways as possible to produce more single use plastic. That’s what our planet needs right now-especially as those bloomin’ Greens keep trying to reduce others uses of oil.

 She burned herself from the popcorn oil twice, and even tho she has the option to go home, she's powering through it. Being one person short on a premiere date for a movie like Incredibles 2 would be a nightmare.
5213 2018-06-15 19:34:51 Matt at some point you're going to have to come to terms with the definition of the truth. It's not going to be pretty for you. You've sold your reputation to a snake oil salesman who likes to pee on people both literally and figuratively

5223 2018-06-15 19:32:55 Currently getting my oil changed.  Sitting in lobby browsing social media.  Scroll up to some awful deep fried meme video.

5234 2018-06-15 19:31:08 Big oil buys out any innovation then buries it in the desk, later to be set on fire just for the sake of converting it to CO2. None of this shit works so long as pigs are in command.
5235 2018-06-15 19:31:06 Well good news my car didn't blow up & I'm getting my oil changed in the morning 
5236 2018-06-15 19:30:59 You’re going to be SO proud of me bc same thing happened last month. Instead of burning my car, I just cried and wiped everything with eucalyptus and peppermint oil. These oils are my new Holy water.

5240 2018-06-15 19:30:49 If I slap a bunch of Mercedes emblems on my Honda and change the oil, does that make it a Mercedes?  Superficiallly mutilating your body and pumping yourself full of hormones means nothing.  Biology doesn't conform to your self identity.
5241 2018-06-15 19:30:31 If I'm grilling, and don't have the opportunity to ask what a veggie muncher likes, I usually grill up some large portabella mushrooms. Little olive oil and salt, pepper, they can be eaten on a bun or off.
5242 2018-06-15 19:30:29 I used baby oil brah
5243 2018-06-15 19:30:25 I would drink truffle oil from the container if the Mr. wouldn’t judge me
5244 2018-06-15 19:30:15 Make sure that your using the correct oil in your engine, or it could affect your cars performance and could damage it.. Unsure?
5245 2018-06-15 19:29:55 I use a lavender oil from doTERRA
5246 2018-06-15 19:29:46 Not sure you are quite crazy enough to become a green,suggest you hang out with Elizabeth May for a while, learn how to lie and spread misinformation about the oil and gas industry then perhaps you will be ready to become a Green Party that is intent on ruining our economy.
5247 2018-06-15 19:29:39 That’s roughly $450 week take home. It’s not just gas. oil changes come more frequent , tire wear and tear come as well. Just some other things to think about.
5248 2018-06-15 19:29:36 Haven’t had the Neck Oil in 2 years .. didn’t like it then .. trying again 
5249 2018-06-15 19:29:35 I scraped passing my MOT because I didn’t know I had to fill up my oil and it was completely empty. 
All my mechanic said was “imagine draining the blood out of you, that’s what you done to your car, but I passed you because you’re quite funny and dimb”
5250 2018-06-15 19:29:16 I have those any time I have to take the car to get the oil changed.

5258 2018-06-15 19:28:40 yeah go ahead and boycott or OIl ,  let see your gas prices  jump up LOL
5259 2018-06-15 19:28:40 Fyi the reason gas prices are falling is bc Trump bargained w OPEC to increase the supply of oil, which drops oil prices and hurts the American economy but most people only care about gas prices so that’s fun

5276 2018-06-15 19:27:40 The red pick up is the same spot where the oil refinery is going.
5277 2018-06-15 19:27:23 yes good point - I mean many of us in Scotland work in Oslo as so many links with oil and gas industry so its hardly a new thing to go to Oslo - and presumably there is some sort of Government office there ?
5278 2018-06-15 19:27:15 Why is it in 2010 Nelson supported drilling for oil off the coast of Fl when Obama proposed it but now it's a bad thing
5279 2018-06-15 19:27:05 Disco oil bussing will create 25 million illegal aliens&gives them free ObamaCare

5284 2018-06-15 19:26:34 Am I really dumb for not speculating that @milkmakeup ‘s Kush mascara would have cannabis oil? I thought kush was a cute play on words to describe the mascara wand. 
5285 2018-06-15 19:26:17 Bravo!!  I think if you looked at vegetable oil studies you’d find the same!
5286 2018-06-15 19:25:32 
5287 2018-06-15 19:25:23 I would try CBD Oil

5290 2018-06-15 19:23:32 lots of people now (and historically) have been physically resilient and robust eating meat and vegetables, just use a natural fruit oil (olive) not an industrial oil (corn, canola, soybean) on your greens
5291 2018-06-15 19:23:10 Only because of the shale oil boom.
5292 2018-06-15 19:23:05 By lib logic going into a bank in the middle of the night is just an after hours withdrawal. 
You get caught, just claim you couldn't wait needed money now.
5293 2018-06-15 19:22:47 I used to take evening primrose oil in capsule form for PMT. it really helped.
5294 2018-06-15 19:22:30 Saw something similar in Syria last year. Even before the siege of Raqqa, the pace of strikes under Trump was many times what Obama authorized. (Trump hit more oil targets in the first half of 2017 than Obama hit from 2014-2016.)
5295 2018-06-15 19:22:28 Had a woman today tell me she was organising a "cruelty free birthday party" for a 3 year old.
No cake or sweets because gluten.
No balloons because they harm the environment.
No plastic toys because of the oil industry.

I'm sure those 3 year olds are going to have a great time.

5310 2018-06-15 19:20:56

5317 2018-06-15 19:20:31 If the cover is smooth/a little slick I use a dad of olive oil
5318 2018-06-15 19:20:20 Don't disagree. We're late in the recovery cycle so of course there are some inflation pressures but with oil declining those pressures are muted & the coming recession (bust) will lead to the first widespread deflation in 80+ years.Fed is making another late cycle policy mistake

5335 2018-06-15 19:18:50 It's not denial of #CBD oil. CBD oil is legal and always has been. The reports that it was recently legalised are incorrect.  Billy's prescribed medicine has a 2:100 ratio of THC:CBD. That small proportion of THC is essential for him #cannabis #EndOurPain #KeepBillyAlive
5336 2018-06-15 19:18:50 My point exactly...at one point crude oil rose to $142 and we never paid this much for petrol
5337 2018-06-15 19:18:49 OOOOOOO I haven’t thought of that! I might try and find some garlic olive oil and do that  I’ve got Linda McC’s fake duck pancakes to try tonight and I’m really excited!

5352 2018-06-15 19:16:20 You do think outside the box. There is evidence now that oil actually regenerates under the Earth, and that it is not the remains of organic material. Coal is definitely organic.

5357 2018-06-15 19:16:00 Not saying that there was no inflation without oil. I'm saying oil is the driving force that pushed inflation through the Fed's threshold. Now that the rise is over, inflation pressures will recede.

5408 2018-06-15 19:09:15 Why do you not lend your name and support to declare that families should not be separated? Is oil drilling that important to you?

5413 2018-06-15 19:08:54 Alberta oil sands reserves cover about 20% of the entire land surface of Alberta. Development / productions covers -2%. Of that 2%, 47% is in-sutu & 53% is surface mined. Hardly ripping up the Boreal Forest.
5414 2018-06-15 19:08:47 URGENT: Trump and Interior Secretary Zinke are rushing to open the Arctic Refuge to oil and gas drilling. Act now and stand up against any move to open the Arctic Refuge to Big Polluters!

Take a cold shower as cold as you can handle & wet your hair...take a goodies or BC flavored powder & wrap up in a blanket with your cold wet hair & the room needs to be dark & go to sleep. Works every time! Essential oil diffusers are good too!
5420 2018-06-15 19:07:38 Has the pitch been watered with Russian oil?
5421 2018-06-15 19:07:35 LMAO! 
5422 2018-06-15 19:07:16 It's fun when you buy a Groupon for an oil changed and spend almost $150 on top of that for other minor work. I'm not entirely convinced I saved any money. 
5423 2018-06-15 19:07:12 Really...you going to make me wait 2 hours for a damn oil change? This is ridiculous @LexusofTowsonMD

5428 2018-06-15 19:06:37 Agree electric cars are giving hydrogen cars a spanking at mo. But big picture is that passenger cars only consume 20% of world oil demand. Meanwhile heavy industry, aviation and shipping need zero-carbon liquid fuels asap

5431 2018-06-15 19:05:44 Manipulation of the oil market is a function of politics, not economcis, no?  Don't need a cartel to manage price if you settle oil in more than one currency...free market currency settlement would make cartel moot point.
5432 2018-06-15 19:05:32 She was trying to fly back to NI with it but was stopped at a London airport and had the oil took off her! Irish GP had prescribed the oil and was then told not too do it again! Absolute disgrace of a government in UK!!
5433 2018-06-15 19:05:24 The fact that I gotta get a oil change when I get off 
5434 2018-06-15 19:05:21 But it has avocado oil....which obviously goes with  
5435 2018-06-15 19:05:16 Brilliant friday. My car needed oil. So I put oil in.. 5litres to be exact. Now my street is covered in oil and I can't drive it. Im working tomorrow. I need to get from A to B in 15mins with 19 miles of a distance. Fuck my life!
5436 2018-06-15 19:05:09 Yeah! My hubby love tomatoes like these with mozzarella, balsamic, basil, and olive oil. I recommend he use these. He likes tart foods a lot.
5437 2018-06-15 19:05:06 Ireland DOES have oil/gas fields, that they sold the access rights to multi national companies, the Irish people DO NOT benefit from the incomes of said fields. A true travesty of political miss management

5439 2018-06-15 19:04:53 Got a Chase fraud alert from my wife taking her car to get her oil changed. Chase is like "Uhh, you don't usually take care of your car..."
5440 2018-06-15 19:04:39 Loadshedding and being single mix as well as oil and water. Kuyabanda, kumnyama, kubi nje. 
5441 2018-06-15 19:04:34 I’ve wasted SOOO MUCH money on gas this week. Fuck Trump & the oil industry.
5442 2018-06-15 19:04:24 I made this dope cashew cream the other day w just cashews, water, lemon jooz, olive oil n salt! So yummy

5452 2018-06-15 19:03:33 Castor oil , tissue oil , coconut oil , glycerin and olive oil . Mix then with your normal lotion . Works like a bomb .
5453 2018-06-15 19:03:21 I use glacier rock dust, kelp meal, probiotic tea, mushroom compost and my own compost... feeding my family and many others, I use neem oil for pest control... raised bed, French intensive. I also produce lavender, rose and organic peppermint teas. Namaste.
5454 2018-06-15 19:03:10 I don't think it's a coincidence that all the evil people we enjoy bombing or shooting live next to rich oil/gas reserves.
5455 2018-06-15 19:03:05 Disgusting how they won't legalize the cannabis oil that's needed
5456 2018-06-15 19:03:00 The corded neck, as thick as a barrel of crude oil, threw him across the clearing as a wrist wrestler would flip a cigar butt.

5458 2018-06-15 19:02:52 That poor boy who needs CBD oil but being refused it just shows how crazy the countries drug laws are. It's natural. It grows. Yet well pump him full of man made shit that doesn't work. How the fuck is that logical?

5465 2018-06-15 19:02:16 That was beautiful. Defiantly agree with his take on butter. In the few kitchens I’ve worked in we would sling butter left and right. There’s no substitute that’s both heathy and functional. Margarine is mostly water, and studies are finding that coconut oil is terrible for you.

5499 2018-06-15 18:58:58 It’s ppl like me who has knowledge about cars but not about to get under a car and change the oil that’s what a mechanic is for

5506 2018-06-15 18:57:55 I just started using rosehip oil again after putting it down from the winter. I thought it'd be too heavy in the summer, but I was wrong!
I heard on the podcast that you're trying to get rid of hyperpigmentation. Have you tried salicylic acid? Paula's Choice 2% BHA is lovely.
5507 2018-06-15 18:57:55 Ororo Anointing oil.
5508 2018-06-15 18:57:36 A lot of politicians whining they had to "work" all night. You sat at a fucking desk and voted and you get the entire summer away from the House Of Commons. Thats's pretty cushy if you ask me. My Pappa spent his entire working life either fishing, mining and working oil rigs
5509 2018-06-15 18:57:32 2 hours for a oil change @LexusofTowsonMD are you kidding me???
5510 2018-06-15 18:57:23 Yup. I also recall his immediate approval of the Keystone oil pipeline upon taking office. 3 times the greenhouse gases--toxic byproducts shipped to India--ruined wetlands and gas prices still on the rise.

5514 2018-06-15 18:57:14 How many good men have to sacrifice for Israel & UK’s ambition to invade other countries for oil & land & natural resources & diamonds for the queen if any left?
5515 2018-06-15 18:57:09 two oil bath for good french fries : first at 180°C , second at 160°C around 10-15 minutes.
5516 2018-06-15 18:57:04 That's nice, but for most people the increases in their healthcare, oil & gas and added costs from Trump's tariffs will negate any benefit. Also, who do you think is going to ultimately pay for the $2 trillion we borrowed for that cut? Hint: take a look in the mirror.
5517 2018-06-15 18:57:01 Yes. Ancel Keys is the man who sold the western world on our modern diets by twisting the data (fat is bad, corn oil/sugar good). 

Just put those civilized diseases by his name, or make a column for 'Externalities of Profit'?
5518 2018-06-15 18:56:55 Grrl drink some Gatorade/Powerade and get those electrolytes/sugar! Also like all commerical (i.e. not for home use) paper towels are a good sub for oil blotting sheets! You got this 
5519 2018-06-15 18:56:51 4. There is no oil residue.
5520 2018-06-15 18:56:46 That's a good business plan..... Roam the globe for suckers that will buy your snake oil.  I'm definitely in the wrong business.

5530 2018-06-15 18:55:09 Agent 1 wishes they had done things differently or done more. Implies some type of overt action taken, just not effective enough. 
So what was it?
5531 2018-06-15 18:54:58 ND oil production up 5 percent to nearly 1.225 million barrels per day. Just misses record 1.227 million/day
5532 2018-06-15 18:54:49 Who's sitting in a auto dealership service lounge waiting for an oil change, but forgot earbuds, so he has to listen to the utter banality of daytime TV? This guy, right here.

5546 2018-06-15 18:53:36 Is it not also in the SNP run ScotGov's best interest to ensure that Scots believe that they actually generate much more revenue than they do (oil klaxon!), so then they can always use the rich enough card? Your argument is circular, and without foundation.
5547 2018-06-15 18:53:35 A4 Such partnership will afford us the opportunity to unite our comparative advantage for our own, I mean continental benefit. 
For instance we can provide for ourselves all the oil, minerals and agricultural produce we need, giving us better leverage with trade.

5548 2018-06-15 18:53:33 Lets do this while the people are angry and are not going to listen to the bullshit that will be rolled out,this time the VOW will not be tolerated, coming out of EU wont be tolerated,oil running out wont be tolerated,all the lies from last time wont be tolerated.our time is NOW
5549 2018-06-15 18:53:31 In two years, oil rose from $26 to $73 & wholesale gasoline rose from .90 to 2.30. That was why we saw the inflation uptick we saw. Without the oil price rise, inflation would not have been an issue & we'd have a different Fed policy. You are welcome to live in your own reality.
5550 2018-06-15 18:53:26 @PizzaExpress #worstpizzaexpress just had a meal at Leeds Horsforth branch.... don't mind you bringing the order wrong but don't argue that the margherita pizza you have brought me was a Soho 65 when it didn't have Rocket, Gran Milano, Buffalo Mozzarella and Garlic Oil!!!
5551 2018-06-15 18:53:23 You're forgetting oil. Which has been (and is) manipulated on & off for a couple of decades resulting in a transfer of wealth to producer nations on a cosmic scale.
5552 2018-06-15 18:52:50 We got an air fryer recently, so I dusted the wedges with olive oil and dipped in chilli breadcrumbs.. deeeeelish!!
5553 2018-06-15 18:52:47 I put a lot of hair oil on them (i dont recommend it if you have oily skin tho)
5554 2018-06-15 18:52:46 Coco butter baby oil gel is not tanning lotion and you will get a minor sunburn aka you're skin is peeling so you need to chill *Note to self*
5555 2018-06-15 18:52:46 Helen nods and sets down the bottle of oil. She was about to show Brock her own battle scars. Carefully Helen undressed and set her clothes aside. Her formerly delicate body was covered in knife marks. It was a record of the damages her ex-fiancé had done to her. (1/2)
5556 2018-06-15 18:52:43 Who is the MP that should be speaking out for Billy Caldwell who is in desperate need of canabis oil?
5557 2018-06-15 18:52:42 @RealAlexJones there are few things more hypocritical than hearing Alex Jones deride “elitists” on air, while wearing a $10,000 watch. Ask him the value of his homes. He’s a secular televangelist. Right down to selling snake oil and miracle water.
5558 2018-06-15 18:52:39 I understand coconut oil/ketones/MCT have helped many people w/ many issues. And for those who tragically get Alzheimers Dx early (50ies/60ies) it's a reasonable option to try. But if you're 90 & w/ mixed dementia, heart disease, DMII.....it will not do anything but drain $$$
5559 2018-06-15 18:52:38 Ororo no be crude oil.
5560 2018-06-15 18:52:33 Watching Spain vs Portugal in one of my locals and it’s £3.20 for a pint of Neck Oil.

5568 2018-06-15 18:51:34 We briefly touched on riparian rights, but Texas uses rule of capture for our water (which is, frankly, evil) so it was only brief. Oil & Gas Law is where most of our mining/water/mineral stuff is taught, and I didn’t take it.
5569 2018-06-15 18:51:31 Cold showers & bany oil will change your life 
5570 2018-06-15 18:51:24 I really hate how long oil paint takes to dry. Yea I know you can manipulate it more blah blah, but my patience is thin.

5572 2018-06-15 18:50:56 At 8 with Annie - We hear from a mum who wants a supply of cannabis oil to treat her son's severe epilepsy

Well he's a billionaire and he's Russian #ifyouknowyouknow
5575 2018-06-15 18:50:42 Find you a woman with low miles and a well kept up oil change
5576 2018-06-15 18:50:31 I really like the fact that my dance teacher is committed to be environmental friendly and she's dragging us with her so beside the palm oil avoidance we also refuse the straws and plastic lids and I am taking my own cup to Starbucks and it's little but it's something 
5577 2018-06-15 18:50:28 MY OLIVE OIL BOY
5578 2018-06-15 18:50:26 She was so tainted and compromised it was damned if you do, damned if you don't. 
Obviously a tough position to be in.

5580 2018-06-15 18:50:04 Where it comes from? Even if I didn’t have solar, 1/3 of my municipal power already comes from renewables and that’s growing steadily. You’re either ignoring the fact that renewables and power storage are already achieving parity with oil, coal, gas, or you’re stupid, or both.
5581 2018-06-15 18:49:59 Don’t people who work in the oil field make like 6 figures a year!
5582 2018-06-15 18:49:50 Is carrot oil really good for the skin?

5584 2018-06-15 18:49:35 Listen, I don’t judge but if you are getting anything more than an oil change from Walmart you might as well go to a real mechanic... they out here blowing people engines 
5585 2018-06-15 18:49:20 Couldn't get the grease stain out of my shirt so I dipped the entire thing in oil
5586 2018-06-15 18:49:12 みんながそうやって炒められて揚げられて…ねぇ、誰のおかげ?誰のおかげかな?

5587 2018-06-15 18:49:04 The alternative is that any old snake oil nonsense gets put out with no filter or reality checking

5591 2018-06-15 18:48:19 And the largest prison population is where? I think Venezuela would be doing ok without U.S. sanctions and regime change artists infiltrating the country. What's Venezuela's problem? Probably too much oil like in Iran ( 1953 ) So, you topple the democratically elected gov't. 
5592 2018-06-15 18:48:19 Jojoba and tea tree oil did wonders for my skin

5596 2018-06-15 18:47:45 The only face time I enjoy is when she sits on mine.
5597 2018-06-15 18:47:44 I hope my mother knows she is paying for my oil change when we get back from Greensboro. 
5598 2018-06-15 18:47:40 my thoughts exactly, truly disgusting. The oil is sitting in a cupboard a couple of miles away. What type of society are we now living in?
5599 2018-06-15 18:47:30 Peppermint oil is the way to go.
5600 2018-06-15 18:47:17 Thank you. I’ve read tweets where Brian plans on using his customers/twitter followers to sell a book he’s writing, a protein supplement, CBD oil line and he’s now using GFM to scam Americans. Guy is toxic.
5601 2018-06-15 18:47:13 If we're not reliant on foreign oil, why blame OPEC?
5602 2018-06-15 18:47:13 My bathroom has bar soap, large pump soap, and fancy flower soaps. There is also a tiny pump bottle of anti frizz stuff for hair in the back.

Without fail guest will choose anti frizz oil to wash their hands and come out of the bathroom saying “I think I made a mistake”

5605 2018-06-15 18:46:40 An economy is like an oil tanker.  It takes a long time to change direction. It’s current momentum is due to Obama’s policies not yours. Your impact will start to be felt when your trade tariffs hit. Let’s judge you then.
5606 2018-06-15 18:46:38 If a Judge had case before them and made the same types of comments, would any reasonable person think they were able to hear case in unbiased manner not affecting outcome?

5610 2018-06-15 18:46:06 Can they at least prove that the oil is of the right grade ?

5613 2018-06-15 18:45:59 Oil/tire changes were definitely part of drivers’ ed at my high school but imagine me under a car greasy doing that shit now...NO LOL
5614 2018-06-15 18:45:57 the *only* time I make an exception is when the cake donuts are just out of the oil fryer (i.e. I think the shelf-life for a cake donut is like 10 minutes before yeast is generally better)
5615 2018-06-15 18:45:48 Niggas be tryna sell me snake oil ... ioneven trust em

[慣用句](香港やその他中華英語圏)
1.頑張れ

同じ意味を持つ中国語の慣用句「加油(jia you)」からの借用語。直訳ですね。「油を加える」→「頑張れ」。

5622 2018-06-15 18:45:21 There be movies, books and billboards against this group of criminals, Crooks and snake oil salesmans for years if not decades to come.
5623 2018-06-15 18:45:19 Maybe they should be replacing the oil with liberal tears

5632 2018-06-15 18:44:37 Heat rock melon and alfalfa sprout in onion powder for just a moment. Serve with a spoon of mustard oil.
5633 2018-06-15 18:44:32 Well, the issue is the amount of military personnel we have. That last time we had a draft was Vietnam and last time we went to war was WWII. These other wars were declared by the president and for questionable reasons. Like the gulf war, was it for fighting Saddam or for oil!?
5634 2018-06-15 18:44:30 Nevile Chamberlain in a skirt. She is swelling with pride for self righteous “tolerance” Easy to spot her type. But then the Gulf States oil money counts for something.

5636 2018-06-15 18:44:12 And all that oil generating
5637 2018-06-15 18:44:06 Usa provides china with food and cooking oil.  China’s farming projects in south america and africa arent ready yet.  China will capitulate.
5638 2018-06-15 18:43:55 My wife and I have been getting more serious about this. Probably power boat, not a sailboat though.
5639 2018-06-15 18:43:51 rosehip seed oil is the best
5640 2018-06-15 18:43:23 Of course that is an error. David is delicious raw with just a drizzle of virgin olive oil.
5641 2018-06-15 18:43:22 Lol at the valvoline guys showing me my new oil on the little stick and me nodding as if I have any idea what it means

5648 2018-06-15 18:41:51 Investment in the #TransMtn pipeline should be done by the Oil Companies that are shipping throught it and recouping some of their costs
5649 2018-06-15 18:41:45 Big pan or skillet, medium/low heat, tinfoil over top of you don't have a lid that fits. I used a little bit of canola oil in the bottom but it's not required.
5650 2018-06-15 18:41:45 I need a new black lipstick lmao the one I have turned into straight up oil
5651 2018-06-15 18:41:40 I’m getting real bold hitting my oil pen at my desk
5652 2018-06-15 18:41:30 No, they'd question why you were changing your oil every 3000 miles like the oil shop says, rather than 5k like the cyborg dealer says is OK.
5653 2018-06-15 18:41:22 Does it really take 40 minutes to do an oil change
5654 2018-06-15 18:41:19 1 1/2 frozen bananas 
1 large scoop peanut butter 
1 scoop coconut oil 
1 1/2 scoop vanilla protein 
10-12 oz almond milk

Tastes exactly like a milk shake without the guilty pleasure. 
A must try!
5655 2018-06-15 18:41:17 Oh, sure, get me interested in a book with no eBook edition. It's 2018, Jen Williams! Save a tree, exploit the ocean for oil!
5656 2018-06-15 18:41:15 Remember the end of Quantum of Solace, when James Bond leaves the corrupt bad guy out in the desert with nothing but a can of oil? The more I read about Scott Pruitt, the more I think this would be a fitting punishment for his corruption. After we fly him there coach, obviously.
5657 2018-06-15 18:40:55 @ABNTHockey what beard oil do you use?

A 12 year old boy is fighting for his life. 
Retract the decision to keep his life saving cannabis oil medication from keeping him alive. If it’s good enough for other ‘first world’ countries surely it’s good enough for the UK?

5665 2018-06-15 18:40:18 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
5666 2018-06-15 18:40:17 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

5672 2018-06-15 18:39:53 Olive oil hasn't been used in the production of catgut for over a century. (E8 Fromage)
5673 2018-06-15 18:39:51 That olive oil
5674 2018-06-15 18:39:49 Oil prices don't really justify current gasoline prices. Exporting has allowed the oil refineries to shift the supply and demand curve to increase prices and their profits.

5691 2018-06-15 18:37:34 Since mostly the oil and coal companies are responsible for this C02 we should make them pay for dealing with it!
5692 2018-06-15 18:37:25 I have the V370  it’s amazing and not that expensive. It picks up amazing details, I’ve used it for pencils, watercolours and oil paintings. I would recommend it 
5693 2018-06-15 18:37:13 Find one who hates housework and it's a win win.
5694 2018-06-15 18:37:01 I like your idea. Personally, I think states should JAIL oil executives and SEIZE their assets when rigs under their charge spill.
5695 2018-06-15 18:36:58 We do! The secret is in the Omega Oil
5696 2018-06-15 18:36:56 I’m not worried about cost but they shouldn’t put a 2 year gap between services when they need oil after six months
5697 2018-06-15 18:36:55 I just stirred a new jar without spilling any oil over the side.  That's going on my resume.

5699 2018-06-15 18:36:34 Read about BP Rothschild and other mega huge oil companies. Then you know. The creation of radical Islam and its benefits to not to the people in the region but Brits and US. Follow the money.

5705 2018-06-15 18:36:09 Had to use the oil filter wrench to open up a new jar of pickles today
5706 2018-06-15 18:36:04 It was the lie of the expansionary fiscal contraction, which only ever had worked once, in Canada at the height of the second oil boom, to justify systematically lowering the share of GDP going to taxation and wages. And the Sensible Voices gave this nonsense a free pass.
5707 2018-06-15 18:35:49 When the alternative is coal or oil...?
5708 2018-06-15 18:35:35 Have you tried bio oil? It works wonders after I lost majority of my weight

5715 2018-06-15 18:34:34 Sadly Trump wouldn't support further oil exploitation, it would 'spoil the view' from his golf course.
5716 2018-06-15 18:34:32 I had to get my oil changed today but I’m like dead broke and he kept telling me all this stuff I needed to buy and I almost cried so he gave me like $10 off lmao
5717 2018-06-15 18:34:26 Cannabis oil is legal in the uk as long as the psychotropic element has been removed.
5718 2018-06-15 18:34:21 The rise in prices come's from the supply chain for companies.That inflation then leads to consumer higher prices. Remember 70% of the US Economy is the Consumer. It won't take much to cause a recession,especially with rising oil prices.

5722 2018-06-15 18:33:55 I don’t define my politics by a cult of personality. There is no politician who would ever convince me to abandon those beliefs which I hold dear.

No way a snake oil salesman gets me to turn my back on my country and that for which my country stands.

5731 2018-06-15 18:32:17 Japan NEDO is funding lenr research. I think Japan may be the 1st one to use lenr on large scale. There is a guy 4m USA who goes to lenr conferences and hugely criticize these effort by Japanese gov. Lenr will lead to drastic shift 4m oil faster than any other green tech.

5740 2018-06-15 18:31:12 If this it the worlds safest pipeline then that's clear evidence there is no such thing as a safe oil pipeline.
5741 2018-06-15 18:30:56 If I say it's olive oil, sure.
5742 2018-06-15 18:30:50 pls treat yourself to a cbd oil massage. omg
5743 2018-06-15 18:30:45 True! ... but the smell and feel of a book... I do need to invest more in kindle. I’m running out of space for more books.
5744 2018-06-15 18:30:39 This is the hill I shall die on. It is sick people food. I hate it. It's got no spice or oil and it's just dal and rice cooked with salt! I've tried a dozen variations of it and the only one I like is Dal Khichdi.
5745 2018-06-15 18:30:38 If you’re wondering what I used to make my body glossy it is called BABY OIL

5756 2018-06-15 18:29:02 I will check out that book. Thanks! Yesterday she happily ate brown rice tossed in olive oil, boiled eggs, and (of all things!) watermelon. Today she's not interested in anything. She's not vomiting, so that's good at least. Hopefully, she'll perk up again in a day to two.

5759 2018-06-15 18:27:44 Have you got someone in mind?  Another corporate Democrat anointed by Goldman-Sachs, Adelson, Big Oil & Pharma, AIPAC ,and the Kochs? We can't afford to lose Bernie,  Warren, Merkley or Brown in the Senate.  Let us play the hand we were dealt and stop the bankster& mobster shills
5760 2018-06-15 18:27:37 What you "accept" is irrelevant. If priced, emissions face a downward sloping demand curve like everything else, and a higher price will deliver lower emissions. The big issue is setting the right price. Whether oil sands development continues to occur at that price is secondary.
5761 2018-06-15 18:27:35 Hannah I've just bought an offshore oil rig with all the money we have.
5762 2018-06-15 18:27:33 All these morons touting "Truedopes incomprehensible stand" will NOT be happy when Canadian economy is in ruins. Fx depreciation. Auto sector about to be tariffed. Metal down. Mfg down 2% already. CAN Tied to NAFTA. Oil supply issues. US i rising, CAN i flattening.

5770 2018-06-15 18:26:45 I need black and red oil based acrylic paint and a few brushes.
5771 2018-06-15 18:26:40 Ordered basically a philly cheese without the bread (so the contents in a container). She put the non-tight container in a bad with a rip on the bottom and gave it to me. All the oil from the container ran down my leg. 
5772 2018-06-15 18:26:35 Then you don't accept the idea of carbon leakage? That winding down the Alberta oil sands production while there is still a growing market for heavy crude oil simply transfers high emissions to jurisdictions that aren't trying to lower the carbon-intensity of their crude?
5773 2018-06-15 18:26:34 ISIS, my friend, is propped by US/Israel, do some research ...even Obama had a Freudian slip on camera saying the US is training/strengthening ISIL. The role of ISIS is to depose Assad....they act as the proxy force for US & Israel. Oil & Gold & propping a Rothschild central bank

5795 2018-06-15 18:22:59 Definitely but since my mom is now in Florida and my dad is in the mountains I have to do all my work with few tools and on the street I live on.

U.S has been a buffer for them, if things were switched they would have similar policy on illegal immigrants.

5814 2018-06-15 18:20:47 - So the service at restaurants here in West Texas is horrible, because anyone with good work ethic and a brain is working in oil.

5817 2018-06-15 18:20:19 I've been dealing with nasal issues for some time. About 2 months ago I started taking coconut oil and tumeric pills. Now I sleep all night without waking up because of nasal blockage. Also, not using nasal mist with steroids. Not sure if it is the oil or tumeric or both.

He was seizure free for 300 days, and has now been rushed to hospital because you abruptly stopped his anti-epilspsy medication.

5834 2018-06-15 18:18:10 Brings to mind Ahmed Zaki Yamani's saying "the Stone Age did not end for lack of stones. The Oil Age will end much earlier than the end of oil".
Current energy outlook and trends seem to confirm it.
5835 2018-06-15 18:18:05 Right on!
5836 2018-06-15 18:17:45 I changed my CBD oil dose to 4x's a day instead of 3x's.  Only 15 mg total a day for anxiety.  The oil seemed to wear off a little in-between the 3 doses.  I heard it can wear off after approx 4 hours and that seems to be my case.  Everyone is different, find your own sweetspot.
5837 2018-06-15 18:17:44 I do a lot with coconut oil too.

5842 2018-06-15 18:17:22 By the end of Uhuru Presidency, debt might hit 8T. And the port will be gone. Oil gone. And most importantly the future of many kids of those who won't get NYS like tenders turned to dust. So, seek ye first a tender or a deal. To insure your kids.

5844 2018-06-15 18:17:16 My ancestors and myself has been cooking and eating coconut oil and milk.. I find it good and it has alot of health benefits.
5845 2018-06-15 18:17:16 Beard oil is a thing? Cool.
5846 2018-06-15 18:17:11 There are 120 calories in a tablespoon of vegetable oil and my entire worldview is collapsing as I consider these radical new truths. Still, I'm losing weight 
5847 2018-06-15 18:17:08 Then a coolin oil massage.. neck down to your feet 
5848 2018-06-15 18:17:00 Also check your manual, I mean even Hyundai recommends Shell for engine oil. They even say to check the certification. Forgot the body that issues it. But it's a global standard.
5849 2018-06-15 18:16:57 Heeeeeeeey I see I wasn't following you yet man! Such a shame.

5853 2018-06-15 18:16:43 Yes, but ironic that the state legislature is still hell bent on destroying our public lands for outdated coal/oil resources! #cognitivedissonance
5854 2018-06-15 18:16:31 I’ve always wanted to live on a sailboat! I’m sure there are plenty of more women out there who do as well. Sailing is simply amazing! My husband would be game, he just has to convince me to give up most of my books...  it’s a tough choice!
5855 2018-06-15 18:16:21 I'm getting my oil changed and there's a guy - who was here first - who would rather watch talking heads talking about the NFL than the World Cup. So I'm being petty and watching it on my tablet with no headphones.
5856 2018-06-15 18:16:20 Oh I'm good brother. Not for me. Plenty of oil and gas jobs here in Texas.

5860 2018-06-15 18:16:00 The uptick in inflation over the past year was primarily due to the rise in oil prices and now oil prices are heading sharply lower. A recession is on its way late this year,early next and it will be the first deflationary downturn since the Great Depression. Not premature.

5862 2018-06-15 18:15:50 I don't even care if i get in trouble, do you want a few ounces of my home grow to make oil for Liam? Free of charge.  This is some BS. I feel for your family
5863 2018-06-15 18:15:44 Lavender oil
5864 2018-06-15 18:15:35 Lol WTF ! I paid that much for a normal mineral oil by Shell like last month when I serviced my car, that too 4 liters. Also, from preliminary search it seems this is some Gujarat based company.
5865 2018-06-15 18:15:33 1 text says individual wishes they could have done things differently, or done more. 
This implies some type of affirmative action, just not effective enough. 
So what was it?

5868 2018-06-15 18:15:23 Yes, I do have #AppsurdCats who are rescues. Sphynx cats love human companionship. Their breed is described as monkey, dog & child. Think about that. They need a bath every week because no fur to absorb oil. They need human, blanket, heating pad windowsill Cat TV is a bonus.

5870 2018-06-15 18:15:09 Have you been watching the Islamic finance markets? I’ve been suspecting that after Dana Gas settlement, yields on Sukuk rising, making OPEC production quotas unsustainable given budget deficits. I think the timing is ripe for oil shorts.

5872 2018-06-15 18:14:59 Iran’s oil exports fell sharply in the first two weeks of June, offering an early signal that Trump’s re-imposition of sanctions may be discouraging some buyers. For its part, India reportedly seeking Special U.S. Waiver For Some Oil Purchases From Tehran

5880 2018-06-15 18:13:56 Lol.... Some people can drink cruel oil....
5881 2018-06-15 18:13:53 Well yes and i did replace the oil in the 11 but the more you put in, the more comes out. As for the 8, which is vastly more hassle to service, I recommend an if-it-ain't-broke-don't-fix-it policy. I reckon that'll do you 20,000km, after which we all know we want a new bike.
5882 2018-06-15 18:13:47 The game stopped being about DNC-GOP.

End the wars
Keep oil in the ground 
Living wage

End homeless/opioid crisis
All else should be ignored

Iraq > ISIS > Syria > potential for another world war

All due to oil.
5887 2018-06-15 18:13:00 That's one narrative. Also, oil is hot again, China is on a debt fast, and B20
5888 2018-06-15 18:12:51 Coconut oil is the worst in oils, because of the fat it contains is mostly saturated fat. That’s why I may recommend you to change your oil because it increases the viscosity of blood which can be dangerous increasing the heart conditions.
5889 2018-06-15 18:12:45 Much appreciation bro! 
5890 2018-06-15 18:12:44 I don't have to steal to avoid women.  I could just go to any construction site, coal mine, fishing boat, power line installation, oil rig, or any other place of employment that make civilization possible.
5891 2018-06-15 18:12:42 now that kennedy's hair is longer, I pretty much gotta keep oil in it because without it, its sooo dry and gets crazy tangled.
5892 2018-06-15 18:12:17 How did oil break you back? Did you slip?
5893 2018-06-15 18:12:15 
5894 2018-06-15 18:12:03 We're not. They use these situations for votes only. They don't care about the people, they refused a great DACA deal that Trump laid out with over a million to get amnesty. Dems said no. They are liars.
5895 2018-06-15 18:12:01 tea tree oil is literally the best thing in the whole world tbr
5896 2018-06-15 18:11:43 "Leave it in the ground" isn't an all or nothing strategy? And what's with "you guys"? I've been writing about the energy transition for 5 years and the likely timeline for electricity displacing oil. The problem for you is that the timeline is longer than you like.

5903 2018-06-15 18:11:33 Oooh yay!! So when you go, wash your face and don’t put anything on after. After you get your lashes you don’t want to use any products with oil in it so just be careful of that. They should give you a little brush so be sure to brush them! Enjoy your new addiction!
5904 2018-06-15 18:11:30 Except when it involves oil and pipelines or lack of religion, right?
5905 2018-06-15 18:11:26 Any furniture guys/gals out there who can recommend a teal oil brand that ACTUALLY works?  Pressure washing today but the oil never makes a huge impact..

5920 2018-06-15 18:09:56  I might even buy a barrel of crude oil. It's tough in our shores.
5921 2018-06-15 18:09:37 I would not regard that as an "all or nothing" policy position, especially compared with an explicit call to leave it in the ground. If, at a carbon price equal to the social cost of carbon, oil sands development becomes unprofitable, then that's fine.

5931 2018-06-15 18:08:14 I agree with you. Headline HICP will reach 2% in summer-autumn due to base
 effect of oil price, but core will be difficult to beat 2%. In case wage growth rises further in core country, wage growth in the other countries will continue to weak due to internal devaluation...

That’s not enough for you, government?

5943 2018-06-15 18:05:42 You’re assuming they won’t do anything to reduce emissions and therefore pay the tax? How do other provinces that don’t have oil royalties pay for services?

Our prison system focuses less on rehabilitation and more on earning shareholders an ROI. MS-13 is a result of that system.
5948 2018-06-15 18:05:27 "Trump's America" did not bring us the botched Kuwaiti oil steal from Saddam's Iraq and then the Gulf War. It did not create WMD and the 2003 Iraq Invasion. Ditto Hillary's Libya Regime Change. Ditto Syria. Ditto Yemen. You were in the room for each, no?

 Mr. Darling, once admitted that Scots oil and gas kept  the UK  ticking over financially for years. If that's true surely wee Scotland with access to the same resources and more would be comfortably off?

6063 2018-06-15 17:53:03 this doesn’t always work for oily gals. oil comes through, even after baking and setting spray, which softens the foundation and makes it transferable again.  it’s inevitable for those of us who suffer from super oily/combo skin.
6064 2018-06-15 17:52:45 completely irrelevant. The oil price is just following the expectations of a rise in Opec+ production. US is actually irrelevant. The ginger boy was crying to get more oil from the "undeveloped" world....

Ballpoint pen ink is normally oil based so failing that, you need something to break that down, like nail varnish remover or rubbing alcohol. You’ll need to feed the leather I’d have thought, it it’ll go dry.

6124 2018-06-15 17:46:53 Sorry to say but 2018-2019 storyline may have had an sad end.. I think we will have too many risk factors and unrealistic hopes the next season incl. this latest signing. I will be more than happy to my estimate to be proven wrong.

6133 2018-06-15 17:46:02 Q: What's your view of today's oil and gas business? How does it feel at Halliburton? A: I think we're coming off the heels of an awful downturn...But when I look at supply and demand, the right things are happening. Jeff Miller at #HOUEnergy
6134 2018-06-15 17:45:57 Incredibly elastic, especially with Permian oil producers underwriting high GOR oil well economics at $0.00/MMbtu associated gas.
6135 2018-06-15 17:45:55 blame it on not being actually able to get more oil out of the Permian via pipeline
6136 2018-06-15 17:45:44 Do you mean CBD? I'm new to all this so I'm sorry if thats what you mean. I just started taking the oil last week and youre right its healpful. It hasnt completly stopped them but I do notice a difference.

6146 2018-06-15 17:44:37 I was talking about how my skin tends to be oily.  I said if my skin oozed any more oil, Dick Cheney would have invaded.
6147 2018-06-15 17:44:32 Msa refinery refined imported crude before ...and it wasn't cost prohibitive. If investments of billions are going to EXTRACT crude oil from Turkana, then common sense dictates we value add and refine the oil! Bottom line economics!

6156 2018-06-15 17:43:06 There is no income from oil now. The only income ever was in the form of tax revenue. There are expenses to offset against profits, and Osborne slashed tax on companies - because Swinney begged him to do so. So oil is actually costing the Treasury money - no oil income.

6222 2018-06-15 17:35:34 With high oil prices, Govt has 2 options:
-Increase petrol prices= taxing  everyone

If Govt takes 1st option, Poor people getting upset is justified but I find it odd when tax payers get angry. Should be happy, it's getting shared.

6261 2018-06-15 17:28:39 i don’t use heavy moisturizes because my skin is pretty oily the spray seems enough for me but if i get dry in a specific place i use mario badescu oil free moisturizer
6262 2018-06-15 17:28:19 True. I'm in oil, too. Royal Dutch Shell to be exact. Other than that, gas, insurance, machinery, gold mining, defense, chemicals. Used to hold tech, but I'm out of there lately. When hedging, yes, I selectively short indices, too...
6263 2018-06-15 17:28:14 Hahahaha you right on that one but ima have to try that oil yous sayin’ aver que hehe
6264 2018-06-15 17:27:36 Some people saying the floor in GOLD has collapsed. True they may be correct, but also the price of OIL is going the same way
6265 2018-06-15 17:27:21 I did something similar as a kid while visiting my grandmother. The bottle was unmarked and looked kinda like Head and Shoulders. It was bath oil, and I learned Grandma used bar soap on her hair.
6266 2018-06-15 17:27:19 You don't have a stake in oil.  That's why they are to high.  Simple.
6267 2018-06-15 17:27:16 I tried that. I never managed it to look "right" and smoothed edges anyway. I used all kinds of "oil brush" brushes for that.
6268 2018-06-15 17:27:14 In 1990 the CEO of Aramco visited China bc he wanted to expand in Asia.He said,”The 2 lane road from Beijing airport into the city was jammed w hundreds&hundreds of bicycles & rickshaws...who was going to buy our oil?”China has bike infrastructure bc cars are still relatively new
6269 2018-06-15 17:27:08 What we should do as men is teach our friends to change a tire or oil if they weren’t blessed with a father who taught them that. And women should have the desire to learn to cook because it’s not that hard lol.

6273 2018-06-15 17:25:56 It’s pretty close. I love Eureka. She performs the house down, has sickening looks, and is HILARIOUS, but those are the things I love about Aquaria too. Ugh the Lucha Libra, The Oil Spill Mermaid and the Inner Saboteur of hers is prob my fav looks of all time.
6274 2018-06-15 17:25:55 Why is no company pursuing a clean, cheap, environmentally friendly solution to Palm oil? #palmoil #GlobalWarming #CO2 #climatechange
6275 2018-06-15 17:25:54 Not drastically but a bitskeez n bihhh I stole that one from u too lmao BUT I included castor oil! The only thing I can’t buy is time sooo gimme a couple more years lol
6276 2018-06-15 17:25:48 You just made it. 
6277 2018-06-15 17:25:36 @Shell_India when you ask for an engine oil change in the petrol bunk, vehicle would have run for at least few kms and oil would be spread in the engine and shows low on the dip stick. When you fill again, volves burst!! I paid 45k for this. Whats ur view??

6279 2018-06-15 17:25:32 they gave me a discount on my oil thoperks of being cute 
6280 2018-06-15 17:25:28 Same here but you wouldn't believe how many Restaurants & Restaurant Chains are using products with palm oil in just because there cheaper
6281 2018-06-15 17:25:01 Malarkey! You could end it with a stroke of your super executive order pen. Or do the oil and banking execs only buy you enough ink to sign their deregulation orders?

6283 2018-06-15 17:24:53 It was after the oil shocks in the 70s. They wanted to get their electricity from something more secure and less prone to interruption. So, nuclear.
6284 2018-06-15 17:24:46 Looks like you don't know much about other countries. 
Nigeria is the largest producer of crude oil and hydrocarbons in Africa. Over 2.5m bpd. 
But how much oil is America getting from South Korea,  Afghanistan and Syria?
6285 2018-06-15 17:24:45 I’m here for unlimited salad and bread sticks, but truffle oil makes me gag. Not because I’m snobby but because it tastes terrible. 
6286 2018-06-15 17:24:40 I just use plain almond oil on a wad of cotton wool,  Let is soak in then buff up.  A lot cheaper at 80p for a bottle and use about half of it each time.

6294 2018-06-15 17:23:14 Why do Republicans always feel Big Oil needs tax breaks and subsidies. 

They make a shitload. Just look at the CEO compensation packages.

You want PA Oil then pay for it. We can use the added income to help pay for education and infrastructure.
6295 2018-06-15 17:23:11 Because i got my oil changed today and got my nails done while I was waiting but didn’t have a ride back.

6315 2018-06-15 17:21:47 Understandable. They need the direct indoctrination to begin at an earlier age.
6316 2018-06-15 17:21:43 About time cannabis oil was legalised, and prescribed on the NHS. It's easy to make the oil, natural, and has healing properties for all sorts of ailments. Wake up @ukhomeoffice.

6320 2018-06-15 17:21:13 @doctorlarrytt I've been taking #CBD oil 4 approximately 4 months. I had pain in my shoulders, back, right knee & my foot that were barely barable.

I've never taken drugs except tylonal or ibuprophen but it was getting 2 where I was taking too many too often. I'm pain free now!
6321 2018-06-15 17:21:11 But...I don’t like water.
6322 2018-06-15 17:21:05 Oil Prices to Leak Lower as OPEC Look to Switch On Supply Taps: OPEC’s 174th ordinary meeting is set to take place on June 22nd where expectations are for a relaxing of the current oil supply quota’s.
6323 2018-06-15 17:21:02 Oil or water?
6324 2018-06-15 17:21:01 Probably an oil in the starter pack.
6325 2018-06-15 17:20:59 Yup, the 2 yr oil rally is over & its heading back to new lows. It will ultimately fall to $10 in the coming deflationary bust. Fed & others worried about an inflation breakout but this past year's inflation uptick was largely propelled by rise in oil prices & that's now over.
6326 2018-06-15 17:20:57 They are worried but some of them  have already reduced their #oil imports from #Iran & another #Indian #refinery will start reducing its imports by August.
6327 2018-06-15 17:20:57 Went to go get an oil change & they had a mfucking DEMON in the showroom. I couldn’t stop staring
6328 2018-06-15 17:20:55 Nigeria is the largest producer of crude oil and hydrocarbons in Africa,  averaging over 2.5mb/pd.

6331 2018-06-15 17:20:30 Start off simple. Once growing your own tomatoes turn them into a thick pulp (no need to use a blender) and just had olive oil, salt, garlic, basil and bay leaf. That's a pasta sauce right there! :)

6334 2018-06-15 17:20:14 Fiance has had crazy sensitive skin since he was young. All I remember is he used tea tree oil for a while. I asked and he recommended cutting out perfumes, dyes, parabins, and sulfides as much as you can. Free and clear type products are good too. Hopefully this helps some.
6335 2018-06-15 17:20:09 U.S. rig count slips by 3 but oil rigs edge higher by 1
6336 2018-06-15 17:20:03 So dropping out of OPEC would lower Consumer Gas Prices? The US Oil & Gas Companies are still using the OPEC speculation model instead of the Tax Cuts Bill model! $2.5 Trillion saved, not passed on to consumers is CRIMINAL! DO YOUR JOB!

6356 2018-06-15 17:18:02 It’s gross to be in these mom groups and see constant oil pushing. Like telling them EOs will cure their cancer. It’s an MLM issue, not an oil issue. There are non MLM oil companies.

6367 2018-06-15 17:16:34 This beach looks like it has been "protected" by the anti-business commies at the EPA.  Plz add more plastic trash, spilled oil, and used syringes for maximum FREEDOM.
6368 2018-06-15 17:16:27 @realDonaldTrump God Bless @realDonaldTrump for his war against the Swamp. But he is wrong about Oil in America. Low oil prices imposed by Reagan killed 90% of American oil and pushed oil imports to $800 billion per year. XL pipeline will kill more. Drill here, drill now.

6387 2018-06-15 17:15:16 Carbon tax is SUPPOSED to be charged to the corporations, not the consumers. Conservatives and yes even Liberals deliberately left loopholes for big oil to pass the buck off to Canadians. You and Trudeau are both just as complicit in this.

6393 2018-06-15 17:14:58 Right, you're not hearing me. We've subsidized oil to the tune of trillions over 4 decades. I'd prefer to shift that subsidy from foreign interventionism to developing and underwriting tech for energy independence. It's a national security issue and we're on the wrong end of it.

When planning to get an oil change, people always look for a cheaper option thinking it doesn’t make much difference. 
TYPES OF OILS
There are basically two major types of oils regular oil and synthetic oil. Regular oil is distilled an

6558 2018-06-15 16:59:08 I have worked in the oil boats in the gulf I have seen what the oil rigs do to protect the waters . They take everything possible to protect waters and people . YES sometimes things happen and yes sometimes even on land things happen everything is a risk in life.
6559 2018-06-15 16:59:02 One might say that dal and many other  indexes are cheaper now since past few months but they would have been cheaper and petrol too. Govt looks fooling people in two things
1. Pricing of fuel is solely controlled by oil cos.
2. They don't divert the gain in food subsidies

6573 2018-06-15 16:57:42 1) There will always be a need for petroleum products.

2) There is no reason why 50% of new cars shouldn't be electric at this point. The ONLY reason is the influence of big oil.
6574 2018-06-15 16:57:41 Which is why it is a good thing to develop your own resources. Roll on Fracking and Shale Oil.
6575 2018-06-15 16:57:40 What do you call it when a producer lowers the carbon-intensity of its heavy crude oil?

6583 2018-06-15 16:57:02 You can have heavy crude oil with the carbon-intensity of the average American crude or with a much higher carbon-intensity. If you don't like those choices, not much I can do about it.

6589 2018-06-15 16:56:29 REMEMBER THAT INFLATION IS ONLY THE ACT OF PRINTING MONEY IN EXCESS OF GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT.THEY COULD BLAME IT ON THE PRICE OF WIDGETS OR OIL ONLY BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNEW THE REAL CAUSE. THE REAL CAUSE AND THE ONLY CAUSE OF INFLATION IS THE PRINTING OF MORE MONEY BEYOND THE GNP
6590 2018-06-15 16:56:25 I don’t know how to pronounce it In English, but it’s the smog. Gasoline, oil water. It just hangs in the air. Like in Japan/China
6591 2018-06-15 16:56:24 Because let's be real, the TRUE cost of oil to the US taxpayer has been tens trillions of dollars in overseas interventionism.

Sorry, but given viable alternatives, the investment of blood and treasure is no longer worth the return.

6617 2018-06-15 16:54:10 Why should I be against natural gas? I'm not an environmentalist purist. I just think that oil is more trouble than it's worth at this point - be it environmental, economic or geopolitical.

It has a fixed lifespan as a viable major energy source. I think we should accelerate it.

6679 2018-06-15 16:46:23 Something to think about , the Danish government has a smaller North Sea oil field than Scotland , but in 2014 it’s tax take from this was £2.229 billion , yet GERS estimates the Scottish governments income from oil as £208 million . There’s a deficit reduction opportunity .
6680 2018-06-15 16:46:06 “Lurking”?  They are pretty far off the shore & just doing their thing.  That plays on irrational fears & sounds as if they are stalkers.  I worry more about the polluters lurking on the beaches w/their cigarettes & plastic; or the oil people & our politicians.
6681 2018-06-15 16:46:02 @realDonaldTrump @JeffSessions @PressSec Biblical stories you cite weren't written for you.

6688 2018-06-15 16:45:12 I'm spending my Eid answering questions about if a rock will hit a train, how long will it take for a person to crash, what is the longest route a person can take and talking about how oil needs to be reduced in the exonomy
6689 2018-06-15 16:45:07 Good chance you’ll see it come down. Trump just said the other day the price of oil is way too high.  Guarantee you’ll see prices lower real quick.

6741 2018-06-17 23:56:00 Castor oil is the best damn thing for your eyelashes and eyebrows. Now 11$ on the other hand is not and it’s most likely not 100% castor oil and may have other chemicals in it. I wouldn’t spend that type of money but that’s just my cheap ass personal opinion.
6742 2018-06-17 23:55:49 So true. The currency is irrelevant. Understanding the oil markets depends on the condition of the geopolitical landscape. Fave book on trading?

6745 2018-06-17 23:54:46 No it doesnt. Its actually the same as putting hot oil on top of the egg yolk to cook the egg whites. The yolk is still as runny as you prefer it. It all goes down to the pan youre using, whether its nonstick or not.

6751 2018-06-17 23:54:01 Your are incorrect. And the oil industry in the US is a perfect example of the US bring OPEC to its knees. The US currently supplies as much if not more oil than Saudia Arabia. When they flooded the market a few years ago it almost bankrupt there country. No more OPEC prod.cuts
6752 2018-06-17 23:53:59 Genocide and torture by the government?  Sounds like an excellent basis for an asylum claim.  I would urge all illegals present in the US, as well as anyone else who feels oppressed, to seek asylum in Mexico without delay.

6755 2018-06-17 23:53:18 Correct.  More power to the oil producer, less to the currency issuer.  Right now there is OPEC and there is the Fed/US Treasury.  Multi-currency oil settlement shifts power from Fed/US Treasury to oil exporters.

6762 2018-06-17 23:52:51 When they flood the market, it is an attempt to lower the sales price.  Cost is what it takes to get the oil out of the ground.  Don’t confuse sales price and cost.

6816 2018-06-17 23:41:30 Why would you even bother listing the oil sector as the price of oil is still trading at late 2014 numbers? Of course there's going to be a lack of investment if it barely pays to drill a hole. I believe investment in this sector also down in the US, but I'd have to double-check.

6826 2018-06-17 23:40:27 Wax will help a lot when it comes to food. Also, just take smaller bites and have plenty of napkins. Beard oil every night and a lil wax when you want it fancy. Otherwise comb it, never pull your hair. It just pulls hairs out leaving it uneven.
6827 2018-06-17 23:40:16 ああ、これはまずい。実にまずい。0.1トン超えたよ。
6828 2018-06-17 23:40:03 Absolutely the government should be investing in core infrastructure including oil and fossil fuel development, as well as risk mitigation.  It is investment in the future and it is what feeds you.

6832 2018-06-17 23:39:31 If anyone thinks there will ever be a free market in oil...no matter what currency it is traded in is delusional...it isnt about currency...
6833 2018-06-17 23:39:26 Please look into CBD oil I’m sure it’s available in India - it is made from hemp seeds and is used for chronic pain. We have started recommending it in the UK. Wishing her well and a speedy recovery.

6846 2018-06-17 23:36:39 I swear if I have to listen to ONE more person lecture me about the virtues of CBD oil, I’m going to need some sort of natural supplement to help me relax.
6847 2018-06-17 23:36:34 Harper turned a 13 billion dollar surplus into a massive deficit before the recession even occurred, he tried to deregulate the banks that caused the US housing crash. And there were record high oil prices that helped contribute to Canada's success.

6869 2018-06-17 23:33:11 US reversal on climate change combined with pushing oil lower could push trajectory of renewables, EV, etc out a few years or more while mkt share war is waged but would arguably be viewed as collusion here if shale co’s influencing price (up at least).

6883 2018-06-17 23:29:38 Iraq's budget for 2018 was $88 billion dollars. Iraq currently produces about 4.5 million barrels per day of oil. They would have to make at least $62 a barrel to break even on the budget including production cost.

6932 2018-06-17 23:23:46 The same thing is happening in India as well. We import enormous quantity of edible oil, the majority of which is GM Canola & GM Soya oil. Nevertheless our policymakers denied us of the opportunity to grow GM Mustard

6944 2018-06-17 23:21:43 One thing that becomes apparent with the ATT/Time Warner merger, is the size of the new company. Comm, Drugs, Oil and tech companies are getting so big that regulators won’t be able to regulate them. Money to congress and millions of dollars to lobbyists will assure it.

6969 2018-06-17 23:18:23 But with oil, the value is in the physical good -- not the token. If Alicestan has tokenized oil and sells its tokens to Bimbobway but the actual oil goes to Charleston, that leaves Bimbobway with worthless worthless tokens. Digital IOUs are not revolutionary.

6984 2018-06-17 23:16:15 Also painting with oil can be such a mess or I just did it wrong. Ah watercolors are kind of difficult for me to paint with and I think i heard about gouache before, but I don’t exactly know what it is, let me google it quickly
6985 2018-06-17 23:16:08 のえちゃんって箕面市じゃなかったっけ？大丈夫かな・・・

6987 2018-06-17 23:15:49 It’s would also be very Trumpian in terms of deal making. “Why do those guys push us around on oil prices? We should set the price with the other two big guys”. Rather valid.

6989 2018-06-17 23:15:34 Check your Engine oil this weekend.
6990 2018-06-17 23:15:23 I wonder too
6991 2018-06-17 23:15:23 NHK見てる限りどうやら大丈夫そうだと思って戦慄した。もう熊本の件を忘れてしまっている…

6994 2018-06-17 23:15:05 I'm trying to talk my mom into getting CBD oil for vaping and stuff just to see if it'd help.
6995 2018-06-17 23:15:01 Or the $110 oil change xD
6996 2018-06-17 23:15:01 大阪市が震源って魔剤？？嘘だろう

6999 2018-06-17 23:14:50 Love this. Did you do this with oil paint?
7000 2018-06-17 23:14:48 "You ain't slick" I overconfidently say to the oil spill of a person that's been pulling fast ones on me for ages now
7001 2018-06-17 23:14:45 make sure u add oil to the mixture before u start stir frying
7002 2018-06-17 23:14:45 The big "terrorized immigrant children in Nazi death camps" narrative seems to be the Big Push.
7003 2018-06-17 23:14:28 そか！よかった。梅田は今から電車乗る人大変そう。でも店のものが落ちたりとかもないみたい
7004 2018-06-17 23:14:25 やべ〜まだ足震えてる
7005 2018-06-17 23:14:21 大丈夫ですかな？
7006 2018-06-17 23:14:21 i went to get an oil change for the first time and got really happy when the dude said “oh yeah, your dad is here all the time!” and then really sad when they charged me $107.46
7007 2018-06-17 23:14:17 6弱はきちい。。。
7008 2018-06-17 23:14:14 なんとか。
立てないほどの揺れでした…
7009 2018-06-17 23:14:12 Americans routinely separated from their kids for long period of times; Military/construction workers/oil workers/forestry workers/scientist/etc, NO uproar from Media/Dems/RINOS..
7010 2018-06-17 23:14:04 Your suggesting the possibility of a new oil alliance of Russia, Saudi and USA? Interesting thought
7011 2018-06-17 23:13:57 Do you have dry skin? Try to moisturize right out of the shower. Pat your skin dry allowing some moisture to remain, then apply oil or cream
7012 2018-06-17 23:13:39 There's one thing and one thing only that Democrats can and should learn from Republicans, it's that after Primaries all the losing candidates should get together and support the winner. In stead of going home and not offering support. Say like Bernie Snake Oil Salesman Sanders.
7013 2018-06-17 23:13:37 生きてる。でも揺れてるときは放心状態だった。めっちゃ怖かった
7014 2018-06-17 23:13:37 All that baby oil makes Cass look like he came straight out of that early 2000s WWE heavyweight class #MITB
7015 2018-06-17 23:13:35 ヌルッとお見通しだ！

7017 2018-06-17 23:13:34 MATE I had just stepped away from an oil painting I’m working on of her thank you for the motivation to get back to it

7021 2018-06-17 23:13:27 You unfortunately are leaving out a few facts as always. Canada has fought with this country through every war. From world war 1 to Afghanistan! They have been selling us their oil sand production, this is why there is a lopsided trade deficit in regards to goods.
7022 2018-06-17 23:13:24 Big Cass found Finn Bálor's baby oil.
7023 2018-06-17 23:13:23 bio oil!!
7024 2018-06-17 23:13:12 How much oil is Cass using? #shiny #MITB #WWE
7025 2018-06-17 23:13:10  it’s hard to tolerate the cold hearted
7026 2018-06-17 23:13:09 Just earlier, I applied oil onto my sword so it has great sharpness. If you touch it even slightly, your fingers would be cut and blood could spill.
7027 2018-06-17 23:13:08 Use oils! Raspberry oil has a pretty decent spf. Mix that with a little shea butter and you good!
7028 2018-06-17 23:12:58 Health and safety? In what way is an oil rig unhealthy or unsafe as you are making it seem?
7029 2018-06-17 23:12:57 あ〜ヤバかった
7030 2018-06-17 23:12:53 So I will.protect our farming, no GM crops, no fracking, no mass flouride in Water, renewable’s investment, create an oil fund if need be, protect our seas have a voice on world stage and political arena. Theres just a very few small reasons. And not to mention protect pensioners

7035 2018-06-17 23:12:16 “With the Santa Fe National Forest being targeted for fracking, it’s  clear the oil and gas industry believes there is no place sacred in the  American Southwest,“With our climate and our future at stake, we’re pleased the court agrees we can't blindly sacrifice our public lands
7036 2018-06-17 23:12:15 I guess you're not surprised at all of the "snake oil" being sold to fools either!  Good times - funny stuff!  
7037 2018-06-17 23:12:13 Do I have to put some more oil on this here switch
Master gave you I mean you. Good name I suggest you take it  go on home

My forearm looks like I got in a fight with a bunch of bees and feels like it too.

7045 2018-06-17 23:11:18 if oil and gas is so profitable, then those corporations don't need government handholding, simple as that
no more grants for efficiency improvements that they should be striving towards anyway
no more skipping out of clean up costs and leaving the bill for taxpayers

7052 2018-06-17 23:10:35 And what does that have to do with today? Should the government be investing in  oil infrastructure! I'm a firm believer in letting the oil industry pay their own way! You have a failed business model if you require subsidies year after year after year!
7053 2018-06-17 23:10:30 James Clapper lied, and it was both Democrats and Republicans who voted on the Iraqis war. Republicans have no more lust for oil than you! By the way Clapper is same guy you fools continue to believe on CNN!
7054 2018-06-17 23:10:29 Those m-effers walk behind our house in our country subdivision. Kill. Them. All.
7055 2018-06-17 23:10:23 I know, I know ... you can’t fight city hall, as they say. But really, what was that ancient, disturbed oil doing to anyone? I mean, if you lived there 40 more years, it all would’ve gone undetected...
7056 2018-06-17 23:10:23 Wow. Big Cass has really gone to town on the baby oil tonight #mitb #wwe #MoneyInTheBank

7064 2018-06-17 23:09:42 Bryan's slips on Cass's baby oil and Cass gets the pin.
7065 2018-06-17 23:09:41 Holy balls can Big Cass have any more oil on his body WTF mate? #MITB
7066 2018-06-17 23:09:38 Geeze did Cass put the baby oil companies out of business or what? Lol #MITB
7067 2018-06-17 23:09:37 He probably stole all of finn's oil.
7068 2018-06-17 23:09:35 I’ve been wanting to experiment with CBD oil for a minute. I found a sale today that’s buy one get one free, which is sweet cause a little bottle is like $70! I’m so happy haha.
7069 2018-06-17 23:09:34 Oh No!!! Not again, what excuse is USA using this time. This is outrageous ME has suffered enough & whatever excuse they come up it’s. fabricated. It’s Big oil & Israel who gain by those atrocities, Putin has not invaded any country yet he’s painted bad guy.#StopWarsInMiddleEast
7070 2018-06-17 23:09:31 oil production will inevitably soon be very much less. US frackers have, this far, lost $280,000,000,000...and, the majors have been cutting way back on "capex" for years. the fact is that no business can go on very long without profit 
7071 2018-06-17 23:09:31 #OOTT
One critical issue for #US #Oil bulls and bottom fishing traders to take into consideration is whether or not current price action is a calm before next storm. In that case, #WTI H4 won't follow #Euro model and more blood is to be seen in the streets.

7077 2018-06-17 23:09:02 The Saudis are understandably secretive about the region's oil. It is known that the Ghawar oil field, the biggest and one of the oldest in the world is filling up with water.
7078 2018-06-17 23:08:59 Grape seed oil and Carrot Seed oil are effectively Hydrocarbons that are filled with impurities.

All are chemicals

Your body relies on chemical reactions to stay alive.

Respiration (Breathing) is a chemical reaction.
7079 2018-06-17 23:08:56 We filled an olive oil sprayer with apple juice. Did the trick!
7080 2018-06-17 23:08:40 Big Cass looks like the "after" of those Flex tape commercials. 

Probably to stop more oil from leaking all over him.

7081 2018-06-17 23:08:36 Wonder if Big Cass needs a bit more baby oil #WWEMITB
7082 2018-06-17 23:08:34 WWE Should ban Baby Oil , dear god Big Cass is slippery #MITB
7083 2018-06-17 23:08:33 There's enough oil on Cass to fuel a small car....

7089 2018-06-17 23:07:37 Well done!  My Aunty who has late stage cancer has started using CBD oil on my advice. It is legally obtainable through Doctors in Florida where she lives. It has made such a difference to the side effects of her strong chemo. LEGALISE NOW!!!

Question is might KSA , UAE & Kuwait go rouge and bust up OPEC?

7107 2018-06-17 23:05:50 Russia-KSA can be the KSAR of oil

Iran is losing production due to sanctions, VZ is collapsing & Iraq has been cheating & hasn’t cut all that much. SA & Russia are the only counties w/meaningful spare capacity (& each has ~2X the production of the 3 combined) & =most of the cuts

-removing carb rich foods to reduce inflammation

7114 2018-06-17 23:05:04 I think whoever wrote the story has not ever considered how to break crude oil down into methane. It is alluded to in the drawing in your first webpage but that part is not included in the Siluria technology

7121 2018-06-17 23:04:28 One of my Int Diff measures seems to lead oil by 6mths. Those Int Diffs broke down in Jan this year. BUT, those same Int Diffs seem to be at or near bottom as all US hikes are priced in. I would suggest a fairly S/T drop in oil (6mths+/-). The next leg up will be due to weak USD.
7122 2018-06-17 23:04:27 My mom just came at me with a bottle of lavender oil from aveda & attacked my face with it... her reasoning? To put my ass to sleep

7128 2018-06-17 23:03:47 The entire debate is stupid and meaningless. One pundit making his case calling them asylum seekers, another talking about illegal border jumpers on the same show. It's pointless. Two totally diff issues
7129 2018-06-17 23:03:34 Um two things: 

State subsidized and state run are two different things. 

Many corporations are state subsidized - oil, farming, coal etc. 

And, bailing on an argument by calling someone a snowflake is a pretty snowflake thing to do. 

If you are going to argue, do it right.

7189 2018-06-17 22:57:18 USA is much more intensely tribal than we see in sitcoms.

Climate change & associated wars & politics around oil are creating the conditions for polarising narratives - middle classes in service of ultra-rich.

7277 2018-06-17 22:43:27 Why are Fish oil pills so big?
7278 2018-06-17 22:43:22 Another weekend, another 48 hours of me procrastinating changing the oil in the cars. I'm amazed onstar isn't complaining.

7285 2018-06-17 22:42:45 President Trump is the King Cyrus of our days, the man God has found with his oil. Love you the Anointed of the Lord , you will always be on my prayer list.
7286 2018-06-17 22:42:42 the new artwork I'm making brings me to the imagination a machine in an old factory trying to make a man and down on the floor filled with torn molds .. the job is working on oil on a tarpaulin. I will give him the name to make a new man
7287 2018-06-17 22:42:28  bae was using Coleman love for oil
7288 2018-06-17 22:42:17 True, though I think if you don't reuse your oil deep frying at home is an improvement over the fries from most fast food establishments
7289 2018-06-17 22:42:00 That’s why @BSommerland started the hashtag #GETLOUD to make them sit up and take notice! The squeaky wheel gets the oil. We are gonna make them make them make the needed and necessary changes. @JeffBezos and @amazon will have to act. It’s hit the media it’s only going to grow
7290 2018-06-17 22:41:55 Depends on u actually
7291 2018-06-17 22:41:21 Keep tea tree oil on that ish
7292 2018-06-17 22:41:18 Think Scotland has supported England enough over the years with our oil wealth and resources. Even own and control all our Scottish newspapers who come out with like this
7293 2018-06-17 22:40:45 Coconut oil massages 
7294 2018-06-17 22:40:44 Bridges the fossil fuel champion hiding inside the facade a green trojan horse pretending all of a sudden he believes in climate change when all it is a TEAL facade and ruse to hoodwink people to vote them back into power so that National can continue oil exploration indefinitely

7296 2018-06-17 22:40:12 I really want what you are smoking! We have the 3rd largest oil reserves on the planet. The Chinese will gladly buy what we send you now. But, you keep thinking that. It’s a long way from Alaska and there is a 200 mile international waters boundary. Shipping it would be very rich

7306 2018-06-17 22:37:41 The break up argument is predicated on their current size - given there is no certainty that they will have this same size in 10 years, then there seems little reason now to contemplate "Standard Oil" remedies.
7307 2018-06-17 22:37:19 Why do we trade with this sick state? Oh yes, they buy weapons.  If it wasn't for oil money Saudi would simply be a patch of dust in the desert. We should as ordinary people be very suspicious of the double helix of Saudi friendship and cooperation.
7308 2018-06-17 22:37:06 Tell them to keep it up Dave - #ijnr_Shale motivated me to go to grad school @UofOklahomaLaw and pursue a Master of Legal Studies in Oil, Gas, & Energy Law #MLSOGE #oulaw #oilandgas
7309 2018-06-17 22:37:03 I think you have it backwards your crumbling economy would collapse without our . We have our own oil reserves in Alaska that is much larger than all of Canada’s production. With Trump nothing to stop us from drilling up there. We would be fine I assure you that.
7310 2018-06-17 22:36:41 Using Tru Oil. Put the first three coats on today. One or two more tomorrow.

7312 2018-06-17 22:35:49 This is why cannabis oil is already legal, because they come different plants,
7313 2018-06-17 22:35:49 #DearFutureDads

When friends tell you having kids is great, it's like they're standing balls deep in boiling oil saying the water is fine.
7314 2018-06-17 22:35:44 me, eating a 100 fortune cookies that i ordered off amazon while putting coconut oil in my eyebrows: honestly self care is so important
7315 2018-06-17 22:35:12 Yeah, I think most peanut allergy folks can eat peanut oil?  It's missing most of the allergens that are present in actual peanuts.
7316 2018-06-17 22:35:10 Know what country has the largest silver mines.
Lots of gold
Lots of good agriculture soil
Lots of rain
Lots of oil 
Good climate
Did you say Mexico? Right?
Saudi Arabia and Israel have no water but do OK.
Very few countries are as blessed as Mexico...no excuse for being so poor
7317 2018-06-17 22:35:10 Okay y’all pray for me bc this plan sounds like it’s about to fall from under me like it needs some oil
7318 2018-06-17 22:34:50 A tip for when you have a hideous cold: I do like those balsam tissues that are supposed to stop your nose getting red raw from constant contact, but if you don’t have any (bc you never do) vitamin E oil applied on the area a couple of times a day is like 1000% better.
7319 2018-06-17 22:34:35 Faux feminism for profit: lubricating the vagina with snake oil.
7320 2018-06-17 22:34:35 Cannabis no, cannabis oil yes there's a big difference cannabis oil doesn't come from weed plant it comes from hemp plant and therefore doesn't carry the THC side effects, I used oil as replacement when giving up weed after smoking it for 20 years
7321 2018-06-17 22:34:10 @neiltyson i think planets lazy it way out of star and they gain mass from slow trickle of star dust even from out star..then the under ground fermentation makes valcanos ..natural gas oil...farther form sun colder higher gas preses makes diamond then farth its a star ..pg 1

7328 2018-06-17 22:33:17 Step up, Geoff. You can take him. Watch out for the baby oil tho.
7329 2018-06-17 22:33:00 These two are so funny.  Love em.  Gonna make some spaghetti with lots of olive oil in their honor (smile).
7330 2018-06-17 22:32:54 Absolutely yes! Our city’s financial endeavor found strong support within Christian community. My friend, Arnita and I were part of a very small minority. She said, “All we need is a vat of anointing oil!” Y’all know I burst out laughing during altar call...
7331 2018-06-17 22:32:40 I can still hear you in the headphones in 1990...'I've got no f***in drive' on warm up lap....you had no 'f***in oil in the gearbox either!

7334 2018-06-17 22:32:07 I grew up a plumbers son myself. I remember using the bumper as my ladder to crawl up on the front so I could check the oil of the old work trucks of this era. Dad taught us everything about shade tree mechanic work and P&H. Our dads are awesome
7335 2018-06-17 22:32:02 Or how about par boil them for 5 mins, drain, leave for a hour put back in pan throw in all purpose seasoning,  and fine corn meal or polenta as it’s also called shake about throw in hot oil bang in over gas mark@7 for 40 minuets and boom! Bang on! The ultimate roast potatoes.
7336 2018-06-17 22:31:52 Where do you get the initial capital from though? Norway had oil money, no?
7337 2018-06-17 22:31:01 hmm well it does effect people differently, hemp oil does help but not as much as I like it to. I want to be in a trance, calm mood something that taking 3 different anti depressants can not even deliver on.
7338 2018-06-17 22:30:48 Germany had full access to Romanian oil. Stalingrad was needed to seal off the Caucasian oilfields from relief from the north. The Germans didn't have enough to seal and take at the same time. More of Hitler's strategic brilliance.
7339 2018-06-17 22:30:43 Cut the claws and try pure coconut oil best when warm . it’s hot  in the south 
7340 2018-06-17 22:30:00 was it cast for the mass who burn and toil? or for the vultures who thirst for blood and oil?
Yes,a spectacle monopolized.
7341 2018-06-17 22:29:49 Probably the 19th century oil baron is winning.  He's my hero & I'm 66.  He's a visionary.  Jobs topped Gates.  Who will top Musk?
7342 2018-06-17 22:29:34 You mean on the oil zone?
7343 2018-06-17 22:29:32 don't forget to coat yourself in olive oil. Then marinate overnight.
7344 2018-06-17 22:29:27 Mr. Prichard. We are your LARGEST provider of oil. If we shut the taps off, your economy crumbles.
7345 2018-06-17 22:29:22 Hot don't forget Prep condom and Lube don't leave home without it! Get some good f****** good lube  Vaseline lotion Crisco oil not Lube have some mercy on the f****** bottom!

7348 2018-06-17 22:27:41 i don’t mean to be dramatic but coconut oil saved my life
7349 2018-06-17 22:27:34 It happens to me from time to time. My eye dr has me take fish oil. It is SUPER effective at helping calm tissue and provide moisture for eyes. I feel your pain.
7350 2018-06-17 22:27:11 色塗りをがんばりたいね

7355 2018-06-17 22:26:29 Since the election results, Ontario corporations have been selling off thousands upon thousands of carbon credits to California and Quebec companies. 
California has a considerately massive oil industry that needs these carbon credits.
7356 2018-06-17 22:26:23 What if Germany had ignored Stalingrad, and instead stayed focused on taking and holding the Romanian oil fields?

Has intrigued me for a long time, but i have never seen it explored in alternate history fiction. Question inspired by "In the Presence of Mine Enemies". Prequel?

7358 2018-06-17 22:26:18 My Dad's best advice was, "Always check your oil". While that was related to cars, I expanded it to taking care of yourself. Don't sweat the small stuff.
7359 2018-06-17 22:26:12 Mouth moisturizer has a lot of coconut oil in it, works well
7360 2018-06-17 22:25:59 no we would be bombing them for oil

7363 2018-06-17 22:25:23 @MTP Let’s pass on interviews with @KellyannePolls. She’s like a fast talking snake oil salesman, talking over questions with an attitude that accommodates anything the administration does, while condemning the same behavior in any opposition. Good government means COMPROMISE.

7370 2018-06-17 22:24:51 Except they are not, in the sense you mean, controlled clinical trials show no therapeutic effects (except for things like tea tree oil, a powerful hepatotoxin killing skin bacteria
7371 2018-06-17 22:24:48 We do have Oil in the north sea-It belong to Norway, Denmark and Russia, I do agree Trade with African and other countries must be fair, it is not why they migrate though , most are not refudgees they pay 1000$ or more to get to Europe, and only Young men
7372 2018-06-17 22:24:47 After months of regular mass consumption of coconut oil, I finally tried MCT oil. It's totally ketosis in a bottle, and it's awesome stuff. I wish I'd used it sooner. Mental clarity and surging energy. Love it.

7385 2018-06-17 22:21:37 Because the US keeps trying to overthrow their government for not opening the oil reserves to private capitalist vultures who want to profit from them

7408 2018-06-17 22:18:34 Make no mistake- Russia won the 2016 American election. The dividends are paid daily, as the Russian economy grows, Russian oil is worth more than before, Crimea is annexed with capitulation from 45, Putin more powerful than ever...Congratulations, Comrade! Your guy won-USA lost.
7409 2018-06-17 22:18:18 I decided to try a FIF packet with chopped red onion and a gala apple, brushed with decent balsamic and oil. Hoping it's a tasty fit of pique.
7410 2018-06-17 22:18:02 people get mad at essential oil vapes for “inhaling” and “going in the lungs1!!1” yet thats literally what happens with a diffuser too... and i know how much kelly the soccer mom of 6 loves her diffuser from target

7412 2018-06-17 22:17:40 In that case note that Stratfor put the reason for invasion of Iraq down to US attempt to increase oil output, thus lower prices to reduce Saudi support for Al Qeada.
7413 2018-06-17 22:17:38 You do know that having too much of it tho which we produce with burning oil means that they will trap sun rays in he atmosphere making the earth warmer right? And plants also emit co2 and make it make it into o2! When did u drop out of high school?
7414 2018-06-17 22:17:37 Lol, this isn't even an oil company.  Geez, this have a clue
7415 2018-06-17 22:17:34 Very good! Now splain to me how that does anything for oil markets and not oil drillers. 

I see how it’s a cash grab for you. I don’t see how that makes my gas cheaper because blockchain, Mr McBellend.
7416 2018-06-17 22:17:33 Looks good... how are you doing removing those oil spots from the floor?
7417 2018-06-17 22:17:19 Hmm - do you have it coloured? Mind, blow drying does that to my hair ends in no time hence I only do it once a week if that. The hair oil really helped ends so it’s my treat to myself! Lasts ages though.
7418 2018-06-17 22:17:12 Faux feminism and "lubricating the vagina with snake oil" are terrific. You need a simpler way to say genital tract profiteering.
7419 2018-06-17 22:17:07 I can’t remember to take my own daily medications, but my dog gets his fish oil pill every day without fail
7420 2018-06-17 22:17:04 I been on jobs cleaning up oil spill from pipeline breaks, you can never completely get everything spilled, it's impossible! Cleaning up bitumen from a train car derailment is a mater of scooping it up with loaders & sending it for disposal along with any contaminated soil!
7421 2018-06-17 22:16:22 Palm oil expansion and large scale agribusiness the world bank supports have push many rural people into poor and landless and  instead increase food waste and diseases related to GMO food production.
7422 2018-06-17 22:16:12 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
7423 2018-06-17 22:16:12 @cathmckenna Hello, I was wondering why Canada is investing in a pipeline when there has been such a big push in eliminating our carbon footprint? Also with the high risk of oil spills, wildlife will be gravely effected. Oil is a dying industry. #GreenEnergy

7425 2018-06-17 22:15:32 NO ONE Gives a Shit—The U.S. Exportation & Dominance of Oil Exploration & Oil Products—Because of President Trump—is All that Matters!!
7426 2018-06-17 22:15:21 Honorable Mention in the Food Terrorism awards:  Truffle Oil.  . It’s pervasive thes days.  Shows up anywhere a cut-rate kitchen wants to “fancy up” something. The smell alone is vile.
7427 2018-06-17 22:15:19 I need my coconut oil from my grandma house
7428 2018-06-17 22:15:11 You have to be accredited investor to invest directly into oil wells which are regulated by SEC because you know...it’s a security.

But keep acting like you know more about oil than someone who owns an oil company, Mr. Weiner 
7429 2018-06-17 22:15:04 girls !!! put coconut oil on ur pussy before ur man eats you out.. YOU ARE WELCOME 
7430 2018-06-17 22:14:54 Use it as a primer before foundation and a setting spray after. My face is an oil slick normally but using setting spray as a primer works really well for me
7431 2018-06-17 22:14:40 Come on @Carrabbas ... you can do better. FYI - the A/C is definitely broken. It feels like I’m swimming in olive oil.
7432 2018-06-17 22:14:38 This is actually quite common. Mineral and oil rights ceased being part of most real estate transactions quite some time ago. Water rights are more commonly sold with property, but people don't let go of the others.
7433 2018-06-17 22:14:34 Sounds like premeditated murder they are going to kill someone. Just for greedy company's.oil shame
7434 2018-06-17 22:14:07 Usually only see an issue at 2 am after the resident starts the oil and passes out on the couch..

7437 2018-06-17 22:13:21 Precious metals, crude oil e.t.c are extracted from these foreign countries for next to nothing in the midst of human right violations and destruction of their environment . They will definitely search for greener pastures when their environment become uninhabitable.

7445 2018-06-17 22:11:41 it's a vitamin C serum!! vitamin c has helped my skin sooo so much over the past few years. i used to use the one from berts bees and that one also works v well! if u don't like rose hip oil then maybe try aloe or witch hazel products
7446 2018-06-17 22:11:32 It’s healthy. No oil. It’s perfect

7452 2018-06-17 22:10:42 Coconut oil is clearly the way forward if two of you are recommending it!

7454 2018-06-17 22:10:32 I don’t understand why people are paying so much money on makeup removing products. Seriously, just use coconut oil, it’s literally in all those other products but they have other unnecessary ingredients.

7456 2018-06-17 22:09:58 okay but i NEED hoseok to throw me into hot oil, deep fry me  and serve me with a side of hot sauce
7457 2018-06-17 22:09:46 ugh i feel you girl.. you can get it from Wegmans, there’s an essential oil section! Lavender is the most versatile oil, and it’s supposed to have calming/relaxing effects, so it won’t be a cure but can certainly help!
7458 2018-06-17 22:09:41 Venezuela is mostly privately held capitalist and overly reliant on oil exports
7459 2018-06-17 22:09:29 yeah greatness, me @ Harris oil rn.
7460 2018-06-17 22:09:28 Every1 incl. those in the know said that all Riley needed was better tools and a facilities. Well, he got the keys to a Ferrari but then it became clear that he didn't even know how to do an oil change. 
Or change the tires.

7463 2018-06-17 22:08:45 Theory: @MontanaSkeptic1 has no short position in $TSLA but is paid by oil industry to convince everyone else to short. The shorts will all be roasted when the burn happens and he’ll be laughing at them for falling for it. @markbspiegel $TSLAQ @SkepticMontana @MontanaSeptic

7465 2018-06-17 22:08:34 Just burnt my hand in oil
7466 2018-06-17 22:08:20 Most people don't understand imported light oil will be brought by ship sent up a second pipeline into Alberta, mix with the bitumen & then pump back to the coast as a heated liquid! Two pipelines & ships with light oil coming in. Double jeopardy! Trains safer!
7467 2018-06-17 22:08:19 No na banga mixed with engine oil

7469 2018-06-17 22:08:14 I promise it don’t take a hour to get your oil changed.
7470 2018-06-17 22:08:12 Our country ,and the world, is still dependant on oil, coal and  natural gas. Solar and wind power are more expensive and are unable to provide the massive amounts of energy to meet the demands of our lives.
7471 2018-06-17 22:08:07 Yes it is just a complete Disgrace. The Federal & Provincial Governments should be proud. Oh yea we don't need oil & gas We will just Raise Taxes
7472 2018-06-17 22:08:05 Daniel Hemric may have to pit, his oil temp at 302 because of debris on his grill.

7475 2018-06-17 22:07:34 They are now in the public domain And guess what the oil isn’t running out! Shock horror, great! As you’ll not need us to subsidise you anymore as you now have fracking and can frack the hell out of your own country
7476 2018-06-17 22:07:33 Anfisa and George are a cute couple, but they’re like oil and water they don’t mix. #90dayfiancehappilyeverafter

7480 2018-06-17 22:06:53 I hope that 10 ml of oil lubricant does not drip down from their bicycle chain. onto the ground.
7481 2018-06-17 22:06:44 Chinese food sound oil rite now ..
7482 2018-06-17 22:06:38 There is no specific link, the more carbohydrates you cut off your diet, the faster you get into ketosis, if you want to get there even faster, you can do any of the followings: a 24hrs water fast, take BHB salts (exogenous ketones), eat MCT oil and Apple cider vinegar
7483 2018-06-17 22:06:23 eg last night I went to Hobart's winter feast. No WG or LF foods in sight. Foods offered were refined carbs, fatty food, lots meat, pastries, fried foods, salads dripping in oil or butter. Only LF food I could find was potato (specially cooked for me). 2/
7484 2018-06-17 22:06:11 So where are we?  I'm confused is this still about how Israel shoots unarmed protesters with expanding bullets some as young as 8 months. stand up for Israel?  Here in Canada?  Oil patch worker.  Follow the money on migration.  Or just call people names and watch your country die

7486 2018-06-17 22:06:10 Tell you what I do? Don’t stress your skin. I use Salicylic Acid every 3 or so days to rid the skin of the dirt and grime. Also, because I use moisturizer with SPF and I get oily pretty easily, I have to keep ensuring that I keep oil to a minimum.
7487 2018-06-17 22:05:35 انت فاهم الاية غلط
7488 2018-06-17 22:05:25 Put some oil in a bowl, add eggs, scramble then put in microwave.
7489 2018-06-17 22:05:20 You might as well change your car oil pussy
7490 2018-06-17 22:05:00 Somehow the word Happy and Trump appears toxic, maybe like oil and water. Just sayin.
7491 2018-06-17 22:04:42 Modify to, “... snake oil is a very poor vaginal lubricant”.
7492 2018-06-17 22:04:31 It was one of my first OPEC meeting as a reporter. I remember it vividly. By the way, same Iranian oil minister as now!!!
7493 2018-06-17 22:04:25 That worries me. Oil co came thru here about 30-35 yrs ago. Said this area has bigger deposit than OK. They tried a test well nearby but drill wouldn't go thru bed rock. Now the can. Fault line here & mtn behind us "thumps" a lot,shakes the bed
7494 2018-06-17 22:04:25 I have an oil painting I brought back from Cambodia, does anyone know of a framing place in Sheffield that would make a good job of mounting it?
7495 2018-06-17 22:04:23 @jimmoginie any new midnight oil comin? I love your band.

7497 2018-06-17 22:04:03 Now there's a snake oil blast from the past. I was suspicious when they said they couldn't allow anyone else to host their 'software'.
7498 2018-06-17 22:03:59 My fellow American Kate Andrews has just said @SkyNews #PressPreview, in a rant condemning #NHS incompetence, that it is spending'100s of millions of pounds a year on anti-dandruff shampoo &fish oil prescriptions.'

7515 2018-06-17 22:00:42 The east coast drilling will be out on the continental shelf, well out of sight of land.   The Atlantic is not the GOM.  Currents carry oil out to sea if there is any spilled.   I fail to see why this is a problem for those of us on the east coast.

7521 2018-06-17 22:00:03 Agree - Ukraine and Crimea are things we should have stood up for- means going head to head with Russia tho! And no one has the balls to risk that. But they know it too. China does the same. Oil rich Middle East countries seem to always have regimes who need overthrowing tho

7526 2018-06-17 21:58:20 I've been putting coconut oil on mine and putting on moisturizing socks overnight, and it works alright, but I'm also intrigued by these!

7538 2018-06-17 21:55:25 Feeling sick at the moment. To the point where I’ve been vomiting but...it’s not just normal vomit...it’s black in color and almost like water or oil...I really don’t know.

7540 2018-06-17 21:55:14 Are there different grades of it like Oil?

Is it supposed to be a stand in for Blood Types?
7541 2018-06-17 21:55:12 Yes. Although cannabis oil does help a poor little boy with epilepsy 
7542 2018-06-17 21:55:11 Are big oil industry CEOs, hazardous waste manufacturers, nationalist fascists...?

7547 2018-06-17 21:54:16 Semi permanent lashes are so worth it! Could get up and go without having to put any makeup on. If done right and looked after properly (so brushing daily and not using oil based products) they don’t do any damage at all as they’ll fall out with your lashes’ natural cycle x
7548 2018-06-17 21:54:11 Na they’re TRASH after they cool down. Once you worked in spoons and see how much oil they’re put in... I swear it gave me high cholesterol
7549 2018-06-17 21:53:44 Or we could cut the nonsense, retweeting snake oil, and talk to actual scientists and sci agencies about their plotting choices.
7550 2018-06-17 21:53:16 IGK's Sold Out Curl Primer paired with their Rich Kid Cocinut Oil Gel, Amika's new curl cream, and Bumble and Bumble's curl cream are all good. But IGK is my fave!! M
7551 2018-06-17 21:53:15 As an ex oilfield worker who spent 17 years in the patch I understand exactly what happen! That train was full of oil that was not degassed as much as it should have been, basically a bomb! Shipping bitumen as a solid is much safer then liquidizing it & pumping it down pipelines!
7552 2018-06-17 21:53:06 Using Bio Oil on my scar. I'm sure it will help long term but it makes me feel physically sick applying it. Not handling this very well.

7557 2018-06-17 21:51:45 Yeah, it’s part of the issue - oily means people end up using products to strip the oil, so scalp just produces more. Skin flakes stick around, so you notice them more. Scalp exfoliating scrub was fiddly, but a nice treat!
7558 2018-06-17 21:51:30 I'll second that Jackie!!! Outstanding #Spanish #oliveoil and fantastic crisps! @great_oil @1916Gourmet

7561 2018-06-17 21:50:49 im literally so dumb but want to use this ... what kind of oil do i use to put in it ??
7562 2018-06-17 21:50:42 Take some chicken breasts or thighs, cut them up, toss them in a ziploc bag with olive oil and some spices, coat them in panko breadcrumbs, and bake.
7563 2018-06-17 21:50:38 Changed the oil and it still runs so I guess I did it right 
7564 2018-06-17 21:50:29 Thought I smelled snake oil.
7565 2018-06-17 21:50:29 for most of us the snake oil placebo psychology 101 between the pages is utterly useless. even a broken clock is right twice a day
7566 2018-06-17 21:49:50 they generally use a base oil, not water, as the carrier
7567 2018-06-17 21:49:48 God bless tanning oil to save my pasty ass

7573 2018-06-17 21:48:38 You might have to try colder blow dry or something though? I do that once a week maybe, but mainly air dry - I find Liz Earle Hair Oil helps dry hair quickly (& mine is quite long). Anything to reduce stress on scalp.
7574 2018-06-17 21:47:54 Tea tree oil unico rimedio valido per me!
7575 2018-06-17 21:47:52 I might kill @camryn_nelson_  ... went to use my aloe today. Mostly sand bc she took the cap to use on my baby oil (which is also sandy). Also there are bugs preserved in my aloe from the lack of cap 
7576 2018-06-17 21:47:35 Health Tips: keep your omega 3 oils(incl. fish oils)  in the freezer to keep fresh and reduce the fish oil repeating on you.

7578 2018-06-17 21:47:27 Our suppliers are working with the Palm Oil industry to change practices to ensure adequate supply from these sustainable sources in the near future  2/2
7579 2018-06-17 21:47:04 Thinking of starting a live stream, doing some drawings and stuff. Would anyone watch? Some comics, oil painting etc.
7580 2018-06-17 21:47:03 Hi Fiona, thank you for reaching out to us. We recognize the importance of sustainability for ingredients we use, and we are currently actively working with suppliers to purchase through a certification program for Palm Oil called the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) 1/2

7582 2018-06-17 21:46:28 You are hereby equally righted to go mow the lawn, then fix the alternator and change the oil in the car, then fix that faucet leak. *Tears up honey-do list and gets a beer instead.*
7583 2018-06-17 21:46:22 I cannot believe our current political climate has made it so impossible to pass new environmental protocols that that have to go for stupid ass, tiny things like straws instead of shrinking oil caps or reducing the price of residential recycling
7584 2018-06-17 21:46:11 It’s only fair!

7590 2018-06-17 21:44:34 Clove oil tastes so vile but does the job of completely numbing my whole mouth 
7591 2018-06-17 21:44:25 google for the ratios, you'll be surprised how far your oil goes with this method. and stick to high concentrate products for your vaping.
7592 2018-06-17 21:44:22 I buy all my snake oil from Graham.
7593 2018-06-17 21:44:22 Yet some fools believe snake oil salesmen, lying charlatans, that a #miniiceage is coming! One such fool I ask “Is it starting at the equator because the poles are melting!” Thawing permafrost! Ice Age! Bullshit!
7594 2018-06-17 21:44:22 @maadbasic China is facing the 3D printing revolution in the USA and a pro America Industrialist President for its survival. We could stop Chinese imports, and end buying over seas oil would not stop the USA.  When we have a cold the world gets pneumonia.  It may come to that.

7596 2018-06-17 21:44:20 When a rail spill takes out a fishery, that’s because a colonially imposed rail line, built without consent, on stolen land, is being used to transport, without consent, stolen oil taken from stolen land, without consent.

DON’T YOU DARE tell FN people it will be “their fault”.
7597 2018-06-17 21:44:15 Yeah. I s'pose. I have two versions mind so I guess I'll have to write em both out. Ah well. And tea tree or eucalyptus oil will keep gnats away. Just dont getbthe stuff near your eyes. It's a bit fumey.

"personal lubricant" or as machinists call it, penetrating oil
7611 2018-06-17 21:42:43 Heyyy, concentration camp comment aside, this is actually a great idea. Sponsor a family. Those that are blessed with much help those w nothing. Pay for legal aid/atty to get parents out & back w kids. Check daily w case workers cuz the squeaky wheel gets the oil. 
7612 2018-06-17 21:42:37 Personally with the low concentrates, i'd recommend for massage oil mixed with olive oil for a carrier and organic sunflower lecithin. You'll feel the benefit that way and not waste what you've already bought. just gently heat them together until they form together. Check..
7613 2018-06-17 21:42:36 All of which can be toxic at the right exposure level (eg lavender oil and breast growth in male children, all essential oils and dermatitis)
7614 2018-06-17 21:42:19 On a CBD note, I just had a friend from college tell me today, she was diagnosed with epilepsy, now I have to do some research on the best CBD oil for her condition, she to scared to drive her own car, pulled up on me in a Uber #Quality #CBD #GMR #FutureFocus #MedicineMan

7616 2018-06-17 21:41:36 Yes, wildfires, bushfires as they are called here, are becoming more common and bigger and more destructive every year. Wildfire season is longer making fuel reduction burns difficult. Yet some idiots believe snake oil sellers’ crap about a #miniiceage coming!

7619 2018-06-17 21:41:20 I get a super dry scalp too, so I can sympathise :( Basically I have to: not overwash (every 2-3 days max, not every day), don’t blow dry often, natural shampoo. Tea tree oil helped & stopped itching too. Don’t change shampoo too often. Scalp scrub helped, will send recipe!

7624 2018-06-17 21:40:19 The actual cost to produce a barrel of oil is about $10 yes but Iraq has many other expenses on top of that that make the sale of any oil for less than $40 not profitable.

7628 2018-06-17 21:39:18 Ooooh!!! Thank you  What is that klairs bottle? I got a bottle of rose hip oil because I heard it helps but it stinks 
7629 2018-06-17 21:39:15 Until Iraq and diversify and create a market economy and reduce the dependence on oil they are at the mercy of meeting that budget
7630 2018-06-17 21:39:01 Also - one time I tried to put a few drops of lemon essential oil in the bath thinking it would be so nice and instead it got on my skin and gave me a chemical burn right on the ass so now you've been warned

7643 2018-06-17 21:37:37 Remember 70% of the budget is wages as most Iraqi's are on the state payroll. Selling oil for $32 a barrel would prevent them for making payroll
7644 2018-06-17 21:37:35 My dad was an engineer, always had a huge tub of swarfega for getting the oil off his hands
7645 2018-06-17 21:37:32 Makes sense, NHS is all Tories have left to privatise. They sold off rail, water, energy, North Sea Oil etc. For sure Tories don't represent the interests of the ordinary British people but they win elections. Really, if the electorate cant understand this now, we deserve it.
7646 2018-06-17 21:37:25 كلنا قائمون علي الدين الوسطي والدين يسر وليس عسر
7647 2018-06-17 21:37:12 Your essential argument is:

a) We colonial settlers are going to transport oil through FN land whether you want us to or not. You don't get to say no.
b) We know what’s best for you.
c) If you resist, we’re going to blame you for *our* actions.

That’s pretty disgusting.

7652 2018-06-17 21:36:07 A - FRIGGIN -MEN!! You are a class above the rest which should take anybody only a millisecond to figure that out. And if they have the audacity to suggest anybody's even remotely in your league, they can go boil in a tub of hot oil and have the fat sold for soap! You're amazing!
7653 2018-06-17 21:35:54 وانتي من اهله
7654 2018-06-17 21:35:46 Iraq is 96% dependent on oil sales what that means is they could never sell oil below market price because they would be under cutting their own budget.
7655 2018-06-17 21:35:45 According to IEA Venezuela oil production could fall to 1 million BPD by end of year and fall under 800,000 BPD in 2019. 12 months ago it was 2 million.
They need 40 rigs drilling everyday to keep production flat. They have about 25 right now.#oil

7660 2018-06-17 21:34:27 They are selling stories to us that Buhari owns nothing. 
First, he had no houses in Abuja, but was later refuted. Now no oil well,  how could he when Late Idiagbon was alive & still his vice. 
But he has a farm, how?He has cars, travels abroad for his medics since 80s etc How???

7671 2018-06-17 21:31:40 It'll be far too late by 2020. Stop using palm oil now.  Please provide a reason why you need to wait. This is a global emergency.

7679 2018-06-17 21:29:56 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
7680 2018-06-17 21:29:38 sorry for involving myself,but has your boyfriend tried 'zinc and castor oil ointment' or "Bulbinella cream"?  I have extremely sensitive skin,and it's worked wonders.
7681 2018-06-17 21:29:19 Ethanol is bad for engines - especially small engines. It actually reduces MOG in autos. Ethanol evaporated more/faster than gas therefore produces pollution that way. This is a payoff to farmers pure and simple as the USA is now the worlds leading oil producer.
7682 2018-06-17 21:29:16 If you floor it 150 yards, stop sign to stop sign, so you can pick up a quart of oil at the corner store, you're doing it wrong..
7683 2018-06-17 21:28:39 I do not know of any Nigerian public officer who does not have a business or group of businesses under the Ministry or regulatory agency he or she heads. 
Right from IBB to GEJ,they are used their positions to enrich themselves and families owning Universities ,oil blocks etc
7684 2018-06-17 21:28:35 islam is a worse threat Mr President. No one will be able to control them when all their countries get nuclear capabilities, they are making Buddhists who are the most peace people in the world fight. World is lost with islam, they hold world to ransom with oil.  #NoToIslam

7687 2018-06-17 21:27:55 You exemplify the problem. @PJTheEconomist is not stating “his views.” He is stating incontrovertible economic fact.

7694 2018-06-17 21:26:04 I’m optimistic about that for short-medium range flights, electric planes capable of that are on the way. Long haul flights are a different story. Oil + jet engines are unique for energy density, safety, low cost. No obvious substitute on the horizon.
7695 2018-06-17 21:25:49 I will look into that.. in the mean time
Did u know US buys our oil BELOW market value.. refines it and sells it back to us at a huge profit?

7699 2018-06-17 21:25:25 Threatening nukes is brutish no matter who does it. There are no rules in arms dealing. Govts. lie. On trade there's govt where you don't need it and when you do they are no rules. Military trade shows are an abomination in desolation.
We rely on clean uncontaminated with oil H2O
7700 2018-06-17 21:24:51 China in particular is quickly transitioning to EVs. By the time the pipeline is built, exports are ramped up and refineries have invested in refining this dirty oil, prices should be dropping as EVs destroy demand. So it won't happen, independent of renewables.
7701 2018-06-17 21:24:48 Are u mad???? Crude oil price. and tax is increased by current gov not by previous gov...
7702 2018-06-17 21:24:44 @kensethnewman78 I really just need to learn how to change my own oil

7714 2018-06-17 21:22:04 I see you quote John Swinney before the oil price crash, oil has recovered and is stable around $74 per barrel, so with that in mind we have no worries for the time being...
7715 2018-06-17 21:21:52 Well it’s hard to bring investment in when oil prices were as low as they were 2 years ago.

7719 2018-06-17 21:21:01 So every country on Earth could get to 100% renewables for electricity, and we'd still be using oil. Meanwhile, BNEF's predictions about EVs (independent from how we generate electricity), suggest oil demand will plateau soon.

7730 2018-06-17 21:19:26 .@EvanLeeson I'm as anti-pipeline as you are, but @MikeHudema is not making a reasonable argument here. There are actually two energy systems - and electricity (nat.gas, coal, renewables), until we have enough EVs, doesn't replace oil (transport). 1/

You don't control the most significant % of Nigeria's diesel & kerosene market (not palm oil) simply cos you are a shrewd businessman, particularly when you have history of being a PDP financier, a GEJ crony & a perpetual subsidy scam beneficiary

7759 2018-06-17 21:15:10 The last company the US gov broke up was Bell. Not only because it was huge. But because US gov regs enabled it to become so. Previously, the US broke up companies that had 90% or more of a market – Standard Oil. It used predatory pricing and other (now) illegal practices.

7844 2018-06-17 21:04:11 You know I'm not sure. I use whatever oil is around the place and it's usually baby oil bcuz I refuse to spend extra money on a makeup remover. I suppose it would be best to use one thats already in your skincare routine. Maybe a lil coconut oil ?
7845 2018-06-17 21:04:02 @checkupcbc the u.s. is now a net exporter of oil and gas for the first time in a long time. So cutting off our oil is not going to hurt them. It's only going to Cripple Alberta in Canada more.

7871 2018-06-17 21:01:33 You could also do one of two things:
- use an OTC ear wash kit (easy to find at any drugstore) to try to flush any potential irritant out of your ears
- put a little drop of mineral oil in that ear canal to ease any potential dryness
7872 2018-06-17 21:01:27 @checkupcbc It's about time we slow down the flow of oil and water to @realDonaldTrump's America. See how long he can golf.

7875 2018-06-17 21:01:14 Lol my skin is so dry that when I got my facial, Bri put on a facial oil and hydrating booster under my mask, then again under my moisturizer, and and then more on top.

7878 2018-06-17 21:01:06 I'm sorry it's not a Democrat or Republican thing. It's a rich and poor thing. I'm a Democrat because of my financial situation. But Trump also has brought the type jobs that I have extensive experience in. The oil drilling rigs. To hiring. So I voted for him

7901 2018-06-17 20:57:17 Isn’t #Oil price was very high during #Conservative rule? How come $13b debts? Must smoking weeds!
7902 2018-06-17 20:57:11  not even the oil, it's the oyel
7903 2018-06-17 20:57:10 You racing at atomic on Wednesday?
7904 2018-06-17 20:56:57 To summarise: There’s basically shit loads of (commercially viable?) oil down there within the 32,000sqkm acreage with 15/20 wells each targeting around 200m barrels......20% of that with partner and major Tullow Oil holding the remaining 80%.
7905 2018-06-17 20:56:56 They have plentiful oil reserves and are a member of opec. They had the best shot at being a seccesful socialist society and it failed
7906 2018-06-17 20:56:54 Why put oil in the rice?? Why? I am trying to get off the #sofas #sosfree
7907 2018-06-17 20:56:52 All Religion is a Form of Madness! Makes me mad! Satellites watch you go to the bathroom in public and private! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
7908 2018-06-17 20:56:49 I'd need some beans with it but apart from that,, so 8/10? Did you do the mushrooms in oil or butter?
7909 2018-06-17 20:56:37 Oil is illiquid? That's actually pretty funny. 
7910 2018-06-17 20:56:23 Calm down. If it wasn’t for the oil you would have been in League 2
7911 2018-06-17 20:56:11 It is CNN that pushes a 24/7 hate campaign. Where's the real news? Yemen war, dead babies, Yankee bombs, oil spill in Pacific, pipeline leak
7912 2018-06-17 20:56:07 You’d think they would make it less obvious  countries from the Middle East it’s all politically/oil motivated anyway, whoever can get the best deal from it and give them a cut that’s who they’ll want to qualify
7913 2018-06-17 20:56:06 Has anyone ever heard of this Blazing Hot DJ in town that goes by the name #DJVillaPeeps?

7915 2018-06-17 20:55:51 Oh! Also, there’s this orange oil in the package that’s a little annoying so I just handle it once & empty into a container and freeze it. Then I break off what I need when I’m cooking.

7919 2018-06-17 20:54:58 Of all the really dumb things we do, using fresh water to extract oil has got to be near the top of the list.
7920 2018-06-17 20:54:33 This is absolutely true. There's an old NJ saying--You strike oil in your backyard and all you get is dead tomatoes. And don't get me started on the crazy rights of HOA s So always have your deed checked before you buy and find out who else has a piece of your pie.
7921 2018-06-17 20:53:56 بجد دة البلاء والجهل  خلاص  تحملوا وبلاش شكوى وتحملوا
7922 2018-06-17 20:53:37 Brave of you not to want to live in a target of capitalist empire because they won't privatize their oil reserves
7923 2018-06-17 20:53:36 1. I don't disagree with that. Thats why i think Somaliland should exist but as a federal state of Somalia with more power and a fair shot at presidency.

2. They are trying to unify without fighting

3. Either way we had factories oil productions. We made our own products.
7924 2018-06-17 20:53:35 Ya know I feel really bad for drinking the castor oil now

7926 2018-06-17 20:53:14 Don’t whitesplain to me when you’re clearly unaware and uneducated on the billions owed to tribes from them leasing their land for oil, gas, livestock etc and have paid pennies a day. They owe billions. To move forward doesn’t mean you don’t forget your history. I do quite well.
7927 2018-06-17 20:53:10 What is with you saying random things and baby oil

7940 2018-06-17 20:51:22 Canadian emissions are very small relative to the rest of the world. If we are serious then stop oil sands development. That will make an impact!

7942 2018-06-17 20:51:10 Splashed hot oil on my face. Fml
7943 2018-06-17 20:51:05 You need a new technology to remove the oil. Less aggressive.
7944 2018-06-17 20:50:19 Why would I want one? Modern cars don't have oil gauges.
7945 2018-06-17 20:50:19 Nnn I need that too but mom is against me using my oil paints T-T
7946 2018-06-17 20:50:07 It also holds that we can't charge different prices for exports nor can we disrupt normal export channels.  Interpreting that as a constraint on Canadian production of oil and gas is hokum of the worst kind.
7947 2018-06-17 20:50:01 After a VERY quick google search, you can easily see that palm oil is in nearly all cosmetic products ESPECIALLY lipstick. 
Since Tay cares *so much* about palm oil, she better wipe that lipstick off her lego block asshole lips.

7951 2018-06-17 20:49:14 I tried to get in touch with my feminine side and ran the car out of oil.
7952 2018-06-17 20:49:13 全ての料理はオイルなしに作れない…(作れるのもあるかも、え、あるのかなぁ)
7953 2018-06-17 20:49:07 Back in the oil field
7954 2018-06-17 20:49:06 It's all about Russia having access to oil
7955 2018-06-17 20:49:02 One to watch this week, rose petroleum have a cpr due. The acreage is huge and has over 1bn barrels of oil in place. Mkt totally missed this one, mkt cap just a shade over 5m.
7956 2018-06-17 20:48:48 Or go on Jimmy Kimmel or the Tonight Show.
7957 2018-06-17 20:48:46 You’ll get there steady wins the race :) do you have an oil you use?

7963 2018-06-17 20:48:25 don't put oil or fat on a burn!!!!! in order to heal it'll need air so I wouldn't wrap it either, if you have a burn cream that's safe for pets in case she licks it, or aloe vera gel without fragrance or dye, I would apply that in a thin layer a couple times a day & before bed 
7964 2018-06-17 20:48:12 oga oil dey your head, you sabi

7966 2018-06-17 20:47:28 Probably has to do a lot more with elevated unemployment than elevated inflation (though oil shocks caused both)
7967 2018-06-17 20:47:22 I know, right? It was truly delicious! 
Keep an eye on #cook_bots , the recipes I'm posting are all cooked with Gaea Olive Oil. 
7968 2018-06-17 20:47:14 It’s apparently impossible that I know anything about cars  Honey, I’ve been helping my dad change oil since before you were born, and the only reason I’m not doing it now is because I live in an apartment. Take several seats before you try to con me into unnecessary services.
7969 2018-06-17 20:47:12 hey y’all can we agree to stop using palm oil thanks

7972 2018-06-17 20:46:26 A lot of people ask me why I moved to Colorado...the answer to that is simple. The economy. I couldn't afford to smoke an ounce of bud and 5 grams of oil a week in Buffalo in this economy so here I am

7976 2018-06-17 20:45:34 Inbox: Has an oil battery, rig, pump, or refinery ever been hit by a tornado?

Many times. Two examples of an F5/EF5 impacting an oil facility: 1960 in Prague a refinery was wiped out and 2011 near Piedmont a drilling rig was toppled and thrown/rolled.

7981 2018-06-17 20:44:43 I tweaked putting all this oil on my legs 
7982 2018-06-17 20:44:40 Looks amazing, only recommendation i would off is if you love your rub, don’t be scared to load ribs with it. Let us know how it ends up, red potatoes with olive oil and rosemary are one of my favorite sides.

7986 2018-06-17 20:44:27 for a while i tried trading just off the DOM and it went ok but i found i missed out on bigger moves because i was looking at the small picture, i prefer a combination now, mainly footprint charts

السريس نوع من الخضار اكثر ما ينمو في زراعة البرسيم او وسط نبات البرسيم زي الجرجير والفجل كده .
نيجي للجعضيض  كمان ينمو في الصيف ولكن على العكس من السريس  فهو ينمو اكثر على ريشة مصارف الصرف الخاصة بالاراضي الزراعية

8007 2018-06-17 20:40:25 Yesterday, while getting my oil changed I refused a new air filter, saying I can do it myself for a whole lot cheaper.

8016 2018-06-17 20:39:40 About as dramatic as a wind turbine accident can get right? Pretty tame compared to even the most mild accident on an oil well or refinery or transport.
8017 2018-06-17 20:39:38 بتتكلم جد
8018 2018-06-17 20:39:32 I do stir them. If I stop for even a split second some stick.

I put oil in the water, doesn't matter. Some always sticks.
8019 2018-06-17 20:39:18 NY Beaches look like Oil & Antifreeze
8020 2018-06-17 20:39:11 I was too shook to go back to bed. I made some of my bath oils, body butters and bath oil melts.  Lucas helped me take them down to the store.  From there I went down to the bar and sat.. and wasn't sure..or maybe I was.. but just waited.
8021 2018-06-17 20:38:55 For dry skin, use a mixture of baby oil and epsom salt. Rub into skin then shower.

8028 2018-06-17 20:37:53 No anchor is going to talk abt economic mishaps that PMLN did. Despite lowest oil (our major import) prices in about two decades, trade deficit widened and exports were lower in 2018 than in 2013. Dollar went from 100 to 125. All this is not in news but IK not wearing shoes is.
8029 2018-06-17 20:37:42 Grandpa's are just the best.  One time my grandpa made me pancakes and instead of syrup he put oil on them. I ate them anyway lolol

8034 2018-06-17 20:36:39 I take 25 mcg a day. In summer and winter. Ill people I recommend double: 50 mcg a day. Blood control with them about 100 nmol/l. Not bad. Combined with the right omega 3 oil low I am convinced inflammation level keeps as low as possible.
8035 2018-06-17 20:36:38 Why would I want one? Modern cars don't have oil gauges.

PS - the last family-owned Bugatti was made in 1952. That's 65 years ago.

8037 2018-06-17 20:36:33 Sometimes I resume my passion for BBQ. Today I'm coating porkchops in paprika & black pepper, cooking them in a skillet in peanut oil & tequila - adding garlic & onions to drippings in the skillet & adding inBBQ sauce, letting it cook together & combining sauce with pork chops.
8038 2018-06-17 20:36:23 Why we should shut down all the Canadian oil lines in support of Glorious Leader Trump!
8039 2018-06-17 20:36:17 squeaky wheel gets the oil....we can't stop...we need to keep on going....how do you think these radical leftists come into power?  It was not overnight...we need to tweet to congress...vote...it's happening in europe now too!  Red Wave Rising!

8046 2018-06-17 20:35:58 où est ce que l'on peut se procurer le primer smashbox oil free en France ????
8047 2018-06-17 20:35:51 I thought that was olive oil not wine #LoveIsland

8050 2018-06-17 20:35:34 Will look closely at oil markets for some time.
8051 2018-06-17 20:35:18 The tyrant is running out of new oil and gas money.
8052 2018-06-17 20:34:59 I give my poorlies layers pellets, oats, egg, little bit of marmite, cod liver oil, made into a warm mash. They love it. The marmite is for b vits, but not too much obvs as salty.
8053 2018-06-17 20:34:50 So improvisation is too small in the big picture. expansion of palm oil use in cooking market not a potential reality? Too much risk of self destruction. You are probably very much on the money but trade anger could unleash some unpredictable strategies.
8054 2018-06-17 20:34:49 Considering Pennsylvania is the ONLY state that does not have a severance tax on natural gas. That we’re paying crazy prices at the pump, and that oil and gas lobbyists are spending millions in Harrisburg to influence opinion on this issue, let’s stand with Governor Wolf.
8055 2018-06-17 20:34:46 Dat sauce or oil juciy crab got in dem bags will fuck a nigga clothes 
8056 2018-06-17 20:34:24 @petersagal what’s with you doing that oil and gas ad on @waitwait? Is @npr now taking money from these polluters and global climate change contributors? SHAME!
8057 2018-06-17 20:34:16 Lol, and this group chose not to accept asylum in Mexico when it was offered, so they walked across another cartel filled country. The scared “refugee” crap is just that 
8058 2018-06-17 20:34:12 Who knew oil could add such a delicate taste
8059 2018-06-17 20:34:07 Thank you @sajidjavid and @ukhomeoffice for granting #BillyCaldwell permission to use #cannabis oil. Wonderful to have some much needed progress in this area. Let’s please move towards medical legalisation to help many thousands more and end the senseless prohibition

8068 2018-06-17 20:33:00 Apparently not. I’m learning so much from 30 something gay guys. Especially about beard oil 
8069 2018-06-17 20:32:37 The sit down and share d funds meant for development. They collect bribes from oil companies and allow d region to be polluted and neglected. Very unpatriotic elements parading as leaders.
8070 2018-06-17 20:32:32 I need someone to change my oil. Would you be so kind? It goes in through here... *spreads legs*
8071 2018-06-17 20:32:28 Lovely Male Oedemera nobilis (also known as the False Oil Beetle).
8072 2018-06-17 20:32:23 Poor little fella. Let’s get this cannabis oil legalised and we can all have half a pint nightly and be done with.
8073 2018-06-17 20:32:22 Everyone needs to be involved with this every farmer Everyone concerned about the environment anyone concerned about for an oil in the amount of money we sent overseas every day everyone concerned about the future of the Midwest the farm you save could be your own
8074 2018-06-17 20:32:01 Could also try Cedarwood oil it works for me.
8075 2018-06-17 20:31:54 The truth is that Scotland contributed much more to the UK economy than its other partners even before the oil boom. That is a matter of public record.

8080 2018-06-17 20:31:08 Oil Politics and Violence + Soldiers of Fortune. Max isn't without his critics too so?
8081 2018-06-17 20:31:07 Yeah, that's what Obama did with: Deportations, Jailing the Press, 2% bombing hit rate on terrorists (genocide of civilians.), supporting big Oil / Pharma / Banks. Overall continuing what W Bush, Bill Clinton and others all did for the billionaires. None of you cared then...

8095 2018-06-17 20:29:16 What the fuck are they doing there, #Macron, like America, playing both sides of the war hegemony, trying to out manoeuvre for oil contracts.
8096 2018-06-17 20:29:13 How much oil they sitting on ?

8100 2018-06-17 20:28:13 Argan oil the midshaft to the ends. Helps your hair dry faster after just toweling it. Less damage and less mechanical intervention. Totally unsolicited advice from one gamer geek to another. Feel free to ignore. 
8101 2018-06-17 20:27:26 I think I'm in the minority here, but I think Koepka has this locked down. Not feeling DJ at all and Reed is starting to leak oil. #USOpen
8102 2018-06-17 20:27:24 Sad to see America using its power to do evil, especially under the leadership of a pro-life President. The liberated oil fields rightly belong to mainland Syria and it's govt, not the Kurds.

Quick and even heating? Heavy base so it doesn't move or deform? Oven-safe? So non-stick that you don't even need oil???

8116 2018-06-17 20:24:59 As I said, the republicans refused to work with President Obama to improve the ACA. All of the blame is on them. Of course he opened up oil, he has millions invested in oil companies. You can’t possibly be this ignorant. Everything he does benefits him. You have to wake up.
8117 2018-06-17 20:24:51 #Graze's fries are made from fresh cut Kennebec potatoes, twice-fried Belgian-style in Non-GMO rice bran oil and seasoned with kosher salt.
8118 2018-06-17 20:24:36 because you have a fresh water port, and a snowned in Territory dosen't help much. The United States of America have the worlds largest oil companys for a reason. It's because of the technical and  technologies wich Russia dosen't have. Russia is a land hard to reach resources
8119 2018-06-17 20:24:13 The “real” truth is that you’ve been duped. 45 is a fraud, swindler, snake oil salesman, criminal, shyster. How many more ways can I explain it? It’s sad that despite all that you’re witnessing, that you would throw everyone under the bus!
8120 2018-06-17 20:23:56 it’s 90° out, i have to go to work and i’m wearing black pants and a black shirt, and my cars leaking oil so i have to take it in. how’s your sunday going :)

8140 2018-06-17 20:20:18 Job creation! Yeah even if it means polluting our water supplies and damaging our environment. With everything one must weigh the pros and cons! Same thing with the oil digging ppl were angry when it was restricted & lost their job but they didn’t even look at the “why!”
8141 2018-06-17 20:20:18 I had been in the hyperbaric oxygen medicine industry for 25 years. To scoff at my own industry from time to time I'd use the expression

8144 2018-06-17 20:19:44 True, but it would work quite well in most of Canada during about half the year, and wind is stronger the other half. Using them to supplement the grid where power plants run on oil would seem to make sense, more economically than one home at a time.
8145 2018-06-17 20:19:43 Just a little olive oil, salt and pepper and bake for ten minutes. (Josh, I prefer saute)
8146 2018-06-17 20:19:25 Accept that instead of having a 17 trilion dollar dept, Norway has an over 1 trillion dollar fund for the future, for when their oil has been depleted. So let's see who laughes last.

8163 2018-06-17 20:16:31 “And when protecting the oil motivates a war, as for example the one in the Persian Gulf, the cost becomes far higher, and not just in dollars.” -Carl Sagan in “Billions and Billions” (1997)
8164 2018-06-17 20:16:21 @elstonsbeerblog I cycled up behind a very smart 2CV at roadworks Nr Bickleigh on Saturday - may well have been yours. Wonderful fragrance of Castrol R, or vegetable oil of some sort ... could you enlighten?

8173 2018-06-17 20:14:46 Your powers that be sold weapons to both sides. A weakened Middle East and a Middle East in conflict has ensured the survival of the US petrodollar and control of big oil but I suspect the U.K. and France have been equally duplicitous
8174 2018-06-17 20:14:44 The absolute best line in Best In Show is “I woke up, I was so glad.” followed closely by “She looks like a cocktail waitress on an oil rig.”

8176 2018-06-17 20:14:13 We need to have white asphalt roads to help global warming and the heat radiation on the road. We also should have solar panels next to roads to light the street lights. We should all drive electric cars because they don’t pollute the air with gas and don’t use much oil. But noo

8197 2018-06-17 20:11:11 if we look at the car as a whole then even worse the VQ’s burn oil like a mf, have notorious issues of not holding power, only have 2 ideal exhaust setups which cost your first born for mediocre gains, they lose a HUGE amount of power through that pos drivetrain they got

8204 2018-06-17 20:09:47 The difference being in this recession our income stream is shot in oil while it heads south while the world GDP is surging ahead. This is literally an economics play and it doesnt make sense for oil companies to operate here. Carbon tax isnt going to be enough though

8208 2018-06-17 20:09:04 There was a time when almost every prairie farm had a Wincharger to provide its electric power. Nowadays power demand is much higher but the equipment is better, too. Rooftop solar is becoming more doable. Using both cuts dependence on oil & gas as well as GHG emissions.

8233 2018-06-17 20:04:43 Yes but it the main issue was Russia pledging non-agression so Hitler wouldn't have to fight a two front war.  In fact shipments of oil from Russia to Germany were being delivered on time and up until the German Invasion of Russia.

Many scents have calming properties. Choose a scent that you find soothing ( Iavender oil is my favourite). The scent will become associated with that calming feeling, it will help you feel relaxed.

8334 2018-06-17 19:45:33 If we as citizens “support” it or not doesn’t mean we have a say so of whether it happens or not, that’s for the politicians to decide.

8407 2018-06-17 19:30:03 It's been lovely. And about to do my regular Sunday lunch thing. 

I think I've added enough cassie to the blend. I just know it's going to be super light once it goes on the skin. Drawback to essential oil perfumes. Ah well.
8408 2018-06-17 19:30:02 Why the fuck does he think everybody buying electric cars is going to suddenly make the oil and gas companies go "Shit I guess we're done boys, time to build solar panels"
8409 2018-06-17 19:29:21 Find a weed supplier and literally steep the bud in hot water as you would a tea bag. Drink. 

Alternatively, order CBD oil online, find instructions online. Also seek help from cancer association& island hospice, they have the skill, knowledge& support you & her WILL NEED 
8410 2018-06-17 19:28:50 Shouldn't have trust those horrible people in the kitchen. It's a mess. There's not even hurricane here but these people bring disaster to me. Oil everywhere. I'm not fineeeeeeeeeeeee. 
8411 2018-06-17 19:28:48 Bull. Theysend that money to Mexico. Mexico’s economy depends on the money Mexicans send to them it’s more than money they make on oil!

8414 2018-06-17 19:27:23 If it was genuine and not an ad, I’d be all about #Landycakes support of a North American rival, but this is an ad by a company that has helped steal land from Native Americans for oil money.

The uncertainty of #OPEC decision has caused ultra high volatility in the oil markets. The expected increase of #crude outputs has given #US #Oil bears the absolute upper hand prior to OPEC meeting and beyond although rebounds shall occur from time to time.
8419 2018-06-17 19:26:34 Sugar and coconut oil mixed feels great!
8420 2018-06-17 19:26:23 Fireworks, butterflies, sexu tension, arousal, wild thoughts by rihanna, once these come naturally, the rest comes in naturally. It is like oil in a nut. 
8421 2018-06-17 19:26:13 Ahh. the perfect Yorkshire. Cup of flour. Cup of milk. 2 eggs. Beat. Lumpy’s fine. Refrigerate. Heat shallow trays. Pour in oil. Heat until smokes. Pour batter. Whack in hot hot oven. Don’t open. Let them rise. Cook until crisp brown edges. Eat with roast & gravy and a warm ale
8422 2018-06-17 19:26:06 How to know if your parent is a foreigner:
1. If they order an ENTIRE deep fried fish for lunch. 
2. They pronounce olive oil as “oliver oil”
3. You understand spanglish perfectly.

8424 2018-06-17 19:25:37 Remind me again, did the sign say, "vegan", or, "meat-free"

Not everyone who wishes to eat less meat has your diet.

Get it?

btw, no dairy in mayo - it's just eggs and oil
8425 2018-06-17 19:25:36 I think it’s something to do with oil production? It’s bloody awesome for spots/breakouts!
8426 2018-06-17 19:25:33 Ooo I'd love this as I want to make the full transition of going palm oil and cruelty-free with my beauty regime! Would be great for my sensitive skin too 
8427 2018-06-17 19:25:13 J'ai commencé dans les années 80, quand j'étais ado, à lire des livres sur l'épuisement du pétrole et force est de constater que nous sommes toujours loin du peak oil... qui n'aura sans doute jamais lieu car les énergies propres remplaceront le pétrole avant son épuisement...
8428 2018-06-17 19:25:03 like my momma used to say sis!! they need to go out&get their oil changed!!

8430 2018-06-17 19:24:29 I can't even remember now, I think Buffet, the rosehip oil, and gratanind or something like that! I based it off one of the regimens it had on the site so fingers crossed it's alright! 
8431 2018-06-17 19:24:01 I need to stop playing and get me an oil pen
8432 2018-06-17 19:23:47 I do, and I throw them in hot oil. But they clearly need something more to make them crispy that my single oven is not providing.
8433 2018-06-17 19:23:43 You can light an oil spill on Fire I think
8434 2018-06-17 19:23:38 Sadly, I won't be getting what I want for Fathers Day. Yup, the wife has refused to cosplay as R. Mika from Street Fighter and oil wrestle me.
8435 2018-06-17 19:23:16 China investing heavily in massively important future technologies, and infrastructure.
Saudi Arabia investing heavily in job creating technologies and strategies for after oil is gone, and infrastructure.
US investing in conflict & govt chaos, but not infrastructure.
8436 2018-06-17 19:23:10 What is the medicine Billy’s taking Steve? Cannabis oil is readily available, I have some lovely CBD/ Coconut concentrate from the vegan food fest! But clearly there’s different preparations which are not currently legal.

8439 2018-06-17 19:22:27 Parboiling is for wimps. With dishwashers... skin on, or off. A bit of thyme, garlic rubbed all over the roasting tin. Salt and pepper, hot oil and let your oven do the work. Our fan oven only ever sees 180°C #roasties
8440 2018-06-17 19:21:42 How do you ingest? Oil? Vape?
8441 2018-06-17 19:21:25 Well, hell then. Let’s just invite the murderous scum to come to the USA. Let’s just drag everything down to the lowest common third-world denominator we can find. That’s what open borders will do. Liberalism is insanity.

8443 2018-06-17 19:21:19 Screw CBD ! I want full extract cannabis oil with a high concentration of THC , and I also want Jeff Sessions to ingest 20 milligrams with me while we both set in massage chairs , eat cookies and watch Looney Tunes !
8444 2018-06-17 19:21:08 I volunteer at a zoo and we discuss this issue all the time and talk to the public about it. Palm oil is in a crap ton of stuff, but I do know that regular Twizzlers are free of palm oil.

8446 2018-06-17 19:20:00 Any leader in 2018 trying to bring in Oil and Gas investment is a fucking relic that has no business leading a modern nation with a forward vision.

Unless its dramatically nationalized it is ALWAYS a predatory and exploitive force and hampers progress towards its demise

8448 2018-06-17 19:19:59 I've never used castor oil so I can't compare! I've heard it's ok for hair growth though. I just stick with this serum as I know it works for me :)

8457 2018-06-17 19:18:51 Love the sentiment, but a bit icky for my taste. But then my tastes are pretty much relics from another century, so don't go by me!  My delicate sensibilities suggest this: "No thanks, faux feminist scammers, our vaginas don't need your snake oil."
8458 2018-06-17 19:18:49 One of the most world changing problems we could solve would be to become independent of oil. 

It should be one of the top problems we should be working on.
8459 2018-06-17 19:18:34 I need a oil change but but but 
8460 2018-06-17 19:18:28 why did I ever spend money on salad dressing when a little lemon, olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic is 100x better?
8461 2018-06-17 19:18:23 i was once involved in renting a house that needed heating oil deliveries, but that truck plugged into a pipe and filled a stationary tank in the basement. it also definitely didn't play music.

8466 2018-06-17 19:17:38 In a pinch, oil, soy sauce & lime juice are a rockin' good salad dressing.
8467 2018-06-17 19:17:37 Ah that's really annoying but could be weather related, maybe switch to an oil cleanser to give your skin a bit of a moisture boost!!xx
8468 2018-06-17 19:17:33 I imagine they have a lot of oil and sugar in to replace the texture of gluten and flavour of animal products! Which would explain sickliness 
8469 2018-06-17 19:17:30 Tbh I sneak off into the bathroom and dab my nose/forehead with toilet seat covers to get the oil off ;-)
8470 2018-06-17 19:17:26 So he’s dating grimes. The quote is dialogue from Daniel Day Lewis portraying Daniel Plainview (the self made oil baron) from ‘There will be blood’.

8481 2018-06-17 19:14:13 One of the saddest things about Billy Caldwell’s case is that British scientists discovered that cannabis oil was anti-convulsive 20 years ago. But this was never developed because all we want to do is stop people using cannabis recreationally.

8538 2018-06-17 19:04:42 This is our chance. The future of the Arctic Refuge is about to be decided. Join me and @TheWCS to say "Absolutely no drilling for oil and gas in the Arctic Refuge" http://1/#.WyawtIaZWQY.twitter

8540 2018-06-17 19:04:14 Show me any prediction of peak oil let alone when we would run out! Analysts argue over that all the time.
So me any credible scientific evidence which proves anthropogenic climate change is a hoax!!!!
You have zero understanding of the science behind it from what I have seen.
8541 2018-06-17 19:04:14 Tommy Fleetwood looks like the dude who would change your oil at Jiffy Lube. And now he might just win the US Open.

8543 2018-06-17 19:03:53 Heard this week from [anon] whilst holidaying in Milan...

“Do you think Moroccan Oil is made in Milan?”

“What year was Jesus born again... hold on... was it the year 1000?”
8544 2018-06-17 19:03:40 A couple of years ago the North See Museum in Denmark burned to the group bc. one of the workers left a bunch of rags w. linseed oil curled up on a newly painted floor...
8545 2018-06-17 19:03:37 Just checked my oil completely by myself for the first time. My dad will be proud. Happy Father’s Day!
8546 2018-06-17 19:03:33 You can use baby powder as a substitute for dry shampoo. It will help the absorb oil
8547 2018-06-17 19:03:20 Happy Father's Day! I love my Dad w/all my heart&wouldn't be who I am today if it weren't4a lifetime of his unconditional love&support. My Dad taught me how2be independent - how2grow a garden, drive a car, change a tire, change my own oil...my dad is everything2me.

8551 2018-06-17 19:02:49 @oil_is_opium greetings
8552 2018-06-17 19:02:43 she did an awesome job because everything I learned from driving a stick shift to changing the oil I learned from Mom
8553 2018-06-17 19:02:40 For the record, cooking oil can get stuff unstuck from glue traps. So if you put down glue traps to catch bugs and, say, a garter snake gets caught, you can save it.

It'll just be a stressful ten minutes for everyone involved.
8554 2018-06-17 19:02:16 Could there be anything worse than being in an airport the day the Young Living convention heads home?! If i never smelt an oil again i wouldn’t be mad.
8555 2018-06-17 19:02:13 Now that is worth considering. Where though? She was refurbished in 1967 at Bremerton WA, but her keel was originally laid in WI (she was an Army ship). A city would have to take that on, including environmental issues. The Arizona is still releasing oil 77 years later. 
8556 2018-06-17 19:02:03 I have a friend who investigates them. Primarily plastics catching fire from mechanical parts/ oil and electrical faults.
8557 2018-06-17 19:01:54 Don't blame the current government. Internationally crude oil increased.
8558 2018-06-17 19:01:47 Hope oil
8559 2018-06-17 19:01:42 Same thing with "just a tablespoon of olive oil", then pours half a cup
8560 2018-06-17 19:01:38 those Nike commercials playing in the cage on that oil tanker probably the best ever

8567 2018-06-17 18:59:15 So, may we all be blessed to master the art of silence, accepting Hashem's plan for us, and thus fix all of our previous lives in this gilgul (reincarnation), in order that we deserve to witness the reinstitution of the kehunah (priesthood) who will be anointed with oil...
8568 2018-06-17 18:59:14 4. There are more than one method of receiving healing from God:
(i) Making Demand - John 14:13-14
(ii) Prayer - John 16:23-24
(iii) Prayer of faith - James 5:14-15
(iv) Anointing with oil - James 5: 16
(v) Laying of hands - Mark 16:16-18
(vi) Gifts of healing - 1 Cor 12:7-9

8583 2018-06-17 18:56:15 Socialist Venezuela is a basket case. They're having to import oil for Christ sakes!
8584 2018-06-17 18:56:13 Stop that. 
8585 2018-06-17 18:56:06 If push came to shove and China said no soybeans from USA they could take all SAmerican crop plus improvise with palm oil and more cereals from Black Sea EU et. They would only need to do it for one season even to cause massive dislocation.?
8586 2018-06-17 18:55:49 I literally am so easily punked at hair salons. This is why I never go. I came for two strand twists, which I could’ve done myself, &was talked into flat twists. She did my hair with moose/foam. No leave in, no oil, nothing. So I know my hair is gone shrivel up and die.
8587 2018-06-17 18:55:43 "America's moral authority" 
LMAO!!!  so... The biggest threat to world peace, the country that has committed countless war crimes, dropped two nukes, sprayed agent orange on Vietnam, killed MILLIONS since WWII & continues to invade & murder for oil & $ is a "moral authority"?

8591 2018-06-17 18:55:10 The #hdfcbank bank chart at Friday's close seemed ready to make a jump up of 3% on Monday, for reasons that can be known only on Monday. 

Not due to oil, which crashed much later hours. 

So whats gonna happen to #banknifty today?

8598 2018-06-17 18:54:53 Don’t bin the stalk, that’s the best bit!!! Snap off the trees, slice the stalk in to circles, approx 1cm thick. Chuck it all in a roasting tin with a bit of olive oil, salt and pepper. Put in over for 15 mins. Beats boiled broccoli hands down.
8599 2018-06-17 18:54:44 Like, don’t change the oil in your car for some years, pretty soon you’ll be walking...
8600 2018-06-17 18:54:36 And it's all veggie Zac!  Missed out the chilli oil tho.

8604 2018-06-17 18:53:07 My dad fought in Vietnam, was a firefighter for 28 years, taught me how to use tools, change oil, fix the house and always told me he wanted me to be more successful than him to give my kids more.  I have. I have taught them how to turn on the Xbox and text.

8610 2018-06-17 18:52:12 Maca is not chemical
Grape seed oil is not chemical
Carrot seed oil is not chemical

Please verify things before making such outrageous claims. 

Thank you.
8611 2018-06-17 18:51:54 Why spred that lie Stossel? So If I have 1 dollar instead of 2 that's better. Only A Fraud would spred that snake oil.
8612 2018-06-17 18:51:47 Well, drat. We wondered where you went all of a sudden. Still, you know you can run with anybody now if you get a little good luck.
8613 2018-06-17 18:51:42 There are dearer oilies out there without a drop of oil or gas and no infrastructure stuck in way unfriendlier places than Texas !!..Decent fields and a reasonably honest BoD.. But fuck that is one unlucky company!

Oil beef hooked
8618 2018-06-17 18:51:00 My last serious attempt at flirting resulted in me giving someone a loaf of bread from a buy-one-get-one-free I had. A week later he took a job on an oil rig.
8619 2018-06-17 18:50:52 And if you don’t get back on the field soon I will personally march up there and force haggis & whiskey & cod liver oil down your gullet. Not a threat, just information.

8622 2018-06-17 18:50:44 There are actually THREE oil storage tanks involved now - the second one burnt, collapsing from the fire and ignited the third
8623 2018-06-17 18:50:39 Exactly
8624 2018-06-17 18:50:18 I've been reflecting on what my dad taught me today:

8628 2018-06-17 18:49:58 CHANGE YOUR GOD DAMN OIL. THATS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO MAINTAINING A CAR.
8629 2018-06-17 18:49:55 I never know how to tell someone I don’t want to be set up with their friend, so I always have to improvise

Friend: “Why not? What’s wrong with her?”

Me: “I don’t know, she just looks like the type of person that prefers tuna canned in oil instead of water...”
8630 2018-06-17 18:49:50 Its pretty obvious all the media wants Mr musk to fail think of all the money lost by oil companies that's why its taken so long the technology of the motor itself could had been made decades ago so why didn't say ford do it .

8632 2018-06-17 18:49:38 I just put vegetables into a hot skillet with olive oil and the hot oil splashed up on me so that was fun.

8634 2018-06-17 18:49:09 Yes, it’s a Ham effort. Pruitt is just another oil stooge is all.

8645 2018-06-17 18:47:41 Could t agree more.  I took delivery of our Model 3 yesterday & no question it’s a game changer!  I also have 2 model X’s. This is from a guy who’s grown up n W. TEXAS & entire family is n oil industry.  I will never buy any other auto.  Traded in my McLaren 12C on P100D as well.
8646 2018-06-17 18:47:29 In one specific year when oil tax revenues plummeted due to accounting write downs. How about an average of the last, say 25 years?
8647 2018-06-17 18:47:24 Eldon made rainbows forty years before his olive oil.
8648 2018-06-17 18:47:17 ok sophie's album "OIL OF EVERY PEARL'S UN-INSIDES" top 5

4. infatuation
5. it's okay to cry
8649 2018-06-17 18:46:58 Yogi Berra was not to condemn attacks on crude oil at least 25% of Common Core!
8650 2018-06-17 18:46:47 Want to know something about Lex Luthor? He's bald like Mr.Clean. He uses baby oil to shine his bald head.
8651 2018-06-17 18:46:35 Surely a talk with legislators in Colorado would help clarify a few issues? Every strain is legal, you can grow your own supply, or buy from a dispensary. Herbal, resin, oil, edible, the works. Has the sky fallen in? No. Crime rates down and taxes up for schools and rehabs...
8652 2018-06-17 18:46:33 Want to find 'cooking oil' in the barber shop? Don't expect to anytime soon.
8653 2018-06-17 18:46:29 I'm cooking for my Dad Tandoori Chicken using Leonardo Olive Oil.

8655 2018-06-17 18:46:06 But it’s not “your” country: you stole it from the “Native Anericans;” this is their natural response. No matter what we’ve built here, or how inclusive or generous, the Left believes America was founded on a fundamental crime, and thus it is forever a morally repugnant entity.
8656 2018-06-17 18:46:00 How I spend my Sunday afternoon in 106° heat.
- jerryrig car's broken bits
- new hubcaps to replace the old finger-slicers.
- oil check, etc.
Linkage to passenger windshield wiper is busted and I dunno how to fix.

8658 2018-06-17 18:45:58 General recommendation:

Mucuna Puriens, 30mg of Zinc + 2mg of Copper, Cod Liver Oil. You have to fight to keep your T.
8659 2018-06-17 18:45:48 Linseed oil is flaxseed oil. It's now sold as a health food. 

Crazy, yes.
8660 2018-06-17 18:45:47 I've been using the oil for about a month now, after my last relapse. My knee and my legs, where I suffer the most, don't seem as stiff as usual. Early days, but I'm going to persevere x
8661 2018-06-17 18:45:46 This explains why G-d cautioned Aharon and his sons against drinking wine when they do the service in the Sanctuary or in the Temple (Parshas Shmini, 10:9). It is because they should not "mix their drinks." A kohen is supposed to be like oil, not like wine.
8662 2018-06-17 18:45:45 I suppose that it becomes a trend when my peers at similar companies are going through a similar experience. Oil production is not increasing, drilling and exploration has been cut dramatically and the services that help maintain infrastructure have been scaled back.
8663 2018-06-17 18:45:30 My dad gave me this oil that’s from weed and asked me what it tasted like & when i said weed he was like how do you know that
8664 2018-06-17 18:45:14 Tnx unfortunately working in oil patch bringing energy to Canada 
8665 2018-06-17 18:44:46 Here's what I've figured out:

1) Heat up pan with fat (butter, oil, whatever)
2) Pour in eggs
3) Almost immediately remove from the heat -- stir and let it cook a little, you'll notice it stick at first and then stop.
4) Put back on heat to cook a bit more.
5) Repeat until happy
8666 2018-06-17 18:44:32 Y el MCT oil, pa cuándooo

8669 2018-06-17 18:43:34 I think about it like the linseed.oil which I just used to pain my son's floor - it polymerizes in 24hours, and if you leave the cloths which you clean w. in a bundle the can self combust. You really don't want to eat that stuff.
8670 2018-06-17 18:43:29 Did I tell you? About all the times that a sweetly sentimental grey-eyed ISTP oil heiress, delicately tearing the seams of a cream-colored jacket, strolling nonchalantly with a nervously quivering Shetland pony.

8674 2018-06-17 18:43:08 CBD oil is the way to go, if you need it medically. The THC that gets you high has been taken out and the medical benefits are good, without getting high

8680 2018-06-17 18:42:12 A Kohen, like oil, is meant to serve G-d privately. We can see this from the fact that some of the holiest services that a Kohen Gadol performs are done in the Kodesh area or in the Kodesh Hakadashim. Nobody else is present in those places when the Kohen Gadol officiates there.

8685 2018-06-17 18:41:39 By contrast, when one pours oil from one vessel to another, it makes no sound. This exhibits oil's essence. Oil is connected to that which is quiet. Additionally, we do not find that the consumption of oil brings a person to reveal his secrets.

8713 2018-06-17 18:37:21 Think you'll find the only reason Westminster hangs on to Scotland is because of the money they happily cream off year on year.

8754 2018-06-17 18:30:28 Exactly what successful Obama economic policies helped recovery? Can't? That's because the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates making cheap money available for market investment also fracking created thousands of jobs and lowered the cost of oil. Obama was a dismal failure.
8755 2018-06-17 18:30:27 With respect Sam, why didnt they use the site provided at Red Rose Park? Or the one at St Helen's, or Oil St nearer Liverpool?  They have options already, which are ignored. Providing more sites is a waste of time until the realisation that enforcement will be taken otherwise.

8757 2018-06-17 18:30:18 Sir, I have one request. Why can't @RSSorg talks about pollution, reducing oil consumption, renewable energy etc. Hindus will be greatly benefited if they reduce oil consumption. It is oil which is financing jihad & hindus r financing their own death.
8758 2018-06-17 18:30:02 You gotta get out here and date in America man. Its a different culture for courtship amd dating (ive dated in both worlds). These men here are influenced by white slave masters like the African dudes are tryna be oil barons and colonizers from the 1800s. smh... lmao

8786 2018-06-17 18:24:57 the technology is here now to make oil obsolete but has been suppressed by large oil corporations and governments.  how much longer must we use these ancient gas engines before we are allowed to use the new methods for transportation.
8787 2018-06-17 18:24:46 Coconut oil or bust!
8788 2018-06-17 18:24:44 That doesn’t justify WHY we would spend more for foreign oil exploration than domestic.

8791 2018-06-17 18:24:32 Permafrost is essential for oil industry to work in Arctic. Climate change is melting the permafrost. To keep going oil companies must cool the permafrost by pumping in refrigerant and warm air out. Go figure!

 it's like they are about to seal the bag and some guy runs over with a bowl full of old oil and says "we almost forgot our secret ingredient" and dumps it in the bag all over the chips.
8800 2018-06-17 18:22:13 Don't let perfect be the enemy of good. Solar, batteries and other renewable technologies have their drawbacks, but they're still way better than simply burning a limited resource. Technology will progress to further reduce our dependency on oil.
8801 2018-06-17 18:22:08 How ironic since progress means ditching oil and gas (and thus pipelines).
Does he even listen to himself?

Progress means change, not sticking with the same thing for eternity.

8814 2018-06-17 18:20:04 Yes exactly. + OPEC meeting should confirm that there is no risk of much higher oil prices.
8815 2018-06-17 18:19:18 Happy Father's day to all the dads offshore today, on vessels and oil rigs. Hope the grub is good and the weather favorable.
8816 2018-06-17 18:19:13 do you ever just wanna drive for a really long time with no destination, but then realize that you’ll need to get gas and check the engine and oil and all that good stuff. and you’re broke.

8824 2018-06-17 18:17:34 Also, i suspect olive oil and nuts are probably better for you than the majority of other foods they could be eating from the supermarket now. If they aren't eating more I wonder if they are eating less of something else? (I haven't read the study in depth).

8835 2018-06-17 18:15:13 Well, uh yeah. I mean any diet based on junk's not gonna be healthy. I wouldn't expect Twizzlers and Fritos to be healthy even though it is vegan. I'm not sure anyone has suggested this. In fact most health interested vegans will quickly tell you stay away from that crap and oil.

8842 2018-06-17 18:14:22 Ya the right way and wrong way lol. From my experience the ones without the holes aren’t crunchy, just basically oily as bread and soggy. The reason they don’t have holes because the guy dropping them in the oil doesn’t know how to make the holes and don’t wanna bother learning

8866 2018-06-17 18:10:43 I guess I've recovered from eating some of my cornbread. I wish I had an animal to feed the rest too. 

I buy the cheapest oil because of money.  I might need to try something else. Peanut oil? I don't like olive oil, which is too expensive.  Probably melted butter if applicable.
8867 2018-06-17 18:10:38 I like to chase my liquor with stuff that sucks worse than the liquor so that I drink more liquor. Hey, I’m gonna have a shot of vodka, then I’m gonna have a shot of oil. Damn man, give me that vodka now.

you wrap into a sausage shape in clingfilm...because its got coconut oil in it it hardens up once you put it in the fridge... I suppose you could have put it in Tupperware..before the fridge?

8890 2018-06-17 18:07:23 The only irresistible deal I can see Ireland accepting is, a payment of £350m per week, NI handed back with full currents costs covered & inflation linked for 100 years. Move LSE to Dublin, automobile assembly plants to Tipperary/Offaly & finally, we also want control of your oil
8891 2018-06-17 18:07:18 I do need to change tortilla sizes. I love flour tortillas (I eat just plain tortillas regularly and @chelsiemess makes fun of me), but I don’t HAVE to use the largest ones they make. I’ve been using oil instead of butter. That would make a big difference too.
8892 2018-06-17 18:07:17 You see my roasted yam with pounded onions and pepper and red oil...I dey even carry am go heaven
8893 2018-06-17 18:07:03 No. Destroying the JCPOA has lead to higher oil prices. This benefits Russia, your sponsor and teh enemy of the US, while hurting ordinary Americans and Europeans. #AnotherTrumpLie

8897 2018-06-17 18:06:06 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
8898 2018-06-17 18:05:56 Jathran insists that he is acting under GNA authority when he decided to attack the oil terminals, but the GNA condemned the attack and distanced itself from the perpetrators. #Libya #PT
8899 2018-06-17 18:05:49 If you’re British, after what happened in Iraq you don’t ever talk about civility. If you’re from US, I’ll just tell about today’s problem only, are the kids still in jail. Bunch of BS, if we stop oil today from the world, you would pay $1000 for a bottle of water. thank you KSA

8902 2018-06-17 18:05:19 I did the mayo, egg yolk, and Coconut oil treatment in my hair and it made my hair SUPER soft, shiny, and manageable, i barely had to detangle it. 
8903 2018-06-17 18:05:16 Been hyping over Blackpink’s comeback these few days and i left my assignment aside so now guess who’s burning the midnight oil to get this shit done by today ;v;
8904 2018-06-17 18:05:03 The only case by which Jathran can actually hold on to the oil terminals is if he gets the support of a third powerful party e.g. Misrata or the GNA in Tripoli -- so far, NO indication that such support is on the way. #Libya #PT

8907 2018-06-17 18:04:55 We all do love oil and gas in many forms. Why oil from feudal countries is good and our own bad, I can not comprehend. 
8908 2018-06-17 18:04:49 it ran out of lubrication oil

8911 2018-06-17 18:04:35 Thanks for this. Do you leave the oil in or wash it out?
8912 2018-06-17 18:04:24 Guys please don’t do this to my blood uncle,shame he doesn’t know phela him and alcohol is water & oil 
8913 2018-06-17 18:03:59 friends ko usi din milna hota hai jis din tum baalon mein oil lagane ka plan banate ho
8914 2018-06-17 18:03:56 Add front and rear poly bushes to the mix as well and a stage 2 oil cooler...
8915 2018-06-17 18:03:55 It is very unlikely that Jathran will be able to control & hold on to the oil terminals even if he takes them temporarily. Large LNA refinrocements arriving in the area + lack of popular/public support for Jathran & attacking force will eventually lead to Jathran's defeat. #Libya
8916 2018-06-17 18:03:52 The fashion industry is the second most polluting industry in the world, second only to oil.

8917 2018-06-17 18:03:45 i thought the same because coconut, jojoba and olive oil all break me out, but oil washing is surprisingly versatile. 20% castor, 50% sweet almond and 30% safflower is a great wash for my persnickety, dry and acne-prone skin

8947 2018-06-17 17:57:44 Agreed....Anyone but the deep socialist Trudeau, and his band of political thugs! Andrew no-show Scheer doesn't SEEM to CARE that the oil industry is crucial to the well being of Canada. He is of the man-made climate change ilk, and therefore, at best, a hybrid conservative.
8948 2018-06-17 17:57:42 Shitty MCT oil?  You've never even tried it because you thought it had fats and lipids in it.   grow up.
8949 2018-06-17 17:57:03 We don’t use conditioner, I don’t have much hair and my daughters haven’t needed it yet, their hair is quite thick and very, very long. The coconut oil is my moisturiser, fantastic for the skin and amazing for my children’s eczema

8954 2018-06-17 17:55:32 Surprised with these comments by great people!!!! , take Netherland vs Venezuela issue ! both 100% sufficient oil but Prices per gallon worlds high range & low range & results we know today’s world !, India the best let them go $100 per gallon or $50 !, let do not touch it
8955 2018-06-17 17:55:16 These people taking all day to change my oil
8956 2018-06-17 17:55:04 Shet isang buong araw ako di nag twitter, at ang dami kong nababasang nakakatawa. Sana nag twitter nalang ako maghapon, kesa naglaba. Haha
8957 2018-06-17 17:54:56 That's #1 on the wiggle index.  The Eagle Spirit pipeline would transport upgraded oil to Hyder Alaska (make more sense to go to Stewart BC as it's basically the same place) no crossing Fraser, no going through Burnaby to Burrard Inlet.  No dilbit.
8958 2018-06-17 17:54:50 imn at the bottom of a oil reserve and theyre gonna drill my dick of

8962 2018-06-17 17:53:56 I spilled oil on it all :O
8963 2018-06-17 17:53:52 And my niece came home to tell us about the Organic Mary (ummm that’ll be Virgin) 
As in olive oil
8964 2018-06-17 17:53:44 omg if i even thought about putting oil on my face i’d break out.
8965 2018-06-17 17:53:37 Oil and powder live

8970 2018-06-17 17:52:39 That native child cold pressed castor oil is so dope. Im impressed #GirlTalkZA
8971 2018-06-17 17:52:33 I can’t use coconut oil on my hair ..
8972 2018-06-17 17:52:27 Canola oil is the healthiest oil for frying
8973 2018-06-17 17:52:26 Drugs coming from central & south America were transported to the oil rigs, then flown to Mena.  That's how customs was bypassed or avoided.  That's the connection (among others) of the oil business.
8974 2018-06-17 17:51:59 The Lord is your strength..
8975 2018-06-17 17:51:55 Uday's words on account deficit is very understandable. India must make a big shift from oil to other sources of energy. There must also be an improvement in mass transportation in urban centers. Further, daily commuters must bicycle to work.
8976 2018-06-17 17:51:49 forcing my friends to listen to so sad, so sexy and oil of every pearls un-insides like 
8977 2018-06-17 17:51:47 The surgeons treatment was like this: First he rubbed a mixture of pine resin and oil on Dohaku’s jaw and bound it in ramie.
8978 2018-06-17 17:51:41 Me, but Only if u rub sun tanning oil all over my before i get waxed on the court lol

8980 2018-06-17 17:51:22 リツイートしてくれる方、ありがとう
8981 2018-06-17 17:51:10 We had a hot oil smell coming into cabin, it didn’t burn any... never found what it was and disappeared after a few miles
8982 2018-06-17 17:51:02 From what the media say you refused to return the oil and told tge family they needed to fork out 20grand for a licence. Peanuts maybe for an Old Etonian but a fortune for a struggling family.
8983 2018-06-17 17:50:54 (KJV) Joel 2:1 Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain: let all the inhabitants of  the land tremble: for the day of the Lord cometh, for it is nigh at hand;
"Do "You" have enough oil in "You're" lamp?"
8984 2018-06-17 17:50:41 And even with current oil price GDP growth would be the same! Import growth would accelerate clearly.
8985 2018-06-17 17:50:31 Need to oil my joints again. I swear, sometimes I feel like the tin man from the wizard of oz =A=
8986 2018-06-17 17:50:21 update: i have spread this gospel & used it again & it works still, so thanks twice. A friend *did* say that if you have digestive problems a possible side effect is oregano oil can exacerbate them, so wanted to make sure you knew as much as I did.
8987 2018-06-17 17:50:15 Too Late Bro 
8988 2018-06-17 17:50:05 This is a time and age where I can't decide whether you are talking about chawanpraash or hair oil/shapmoo/face pack/fash wash/soap brand.
8989 2018-06-17 17:49:49 What was caused it to burn oil on the way?
8990 2018-06-17 17:49:41 So in other words the dash on these 2 gems didn't include an oil light?
8991 2018-06-17 17:49:38 I don't even know how you manage yours. Although this new beard oil scent is unreal!
8992 2018-06-17 17:49:18 Booker the ultimate political parasite praying on weak minded drones so he can continue to enrich himself. When are people going to see thru these snake oil salesman and their self serving bullshit.#fakeoutrage
8993 2018-06-17 17:49:16 At least he knows where to get good olive oil unlike everyone else that suffers with supermarket versions 
8994 2018-06-17 17:49:12 Don't tell me what's wrong with my car, just change my oil
8995 2018-06-17 17:49:10 They didn’t come from the oil biz either. They just got planted into it. They had no business in that sector w/their east coast pedigree
8996 2018-06-17 17:49:08 ああオイル、どうして君はオイルなんだ…
8997 2018-06-17 17:49:06 This indomie advert that they are using brush to do oil painting on fish cracks me up 
8998 2018-06-17 17:48:59 Somebody bring me some Tea Tree Oil please 
8999 2018-06-17 17:48:54 "And when you are come in, you shall shut the door upon u & upon ur sons,  and shall pour out into all those vessels, and you shall set aside that which is full (The Holy Spirit "oil" is inexhaustible as long as there are "empty vessels" He will continue to "pour out")'  2Ki4:4
9000 2018-06-17 17:48:31 Pappu ke oil jo lga rhe hai naa wo sab ke sab chor hai
9001 2018-06-17 17:48:25 I’ve done both bruh, even had the oil and i ain’t never wilded out like this before 
9002 2018-06-17 17:48:22 There was an ad at the theater about oil well site safety #OnlyInOklahoma

9004 2018-06-17 17:48:09 sorry to butt in, but castor oil is also really good at conditioning lashes and keeping them nice if you frequently wear false lashes!
9005 2018-06-17 17:48:07 Don’t forget more of your favourite gammon pin up’s achievements: mass unemployment, wasting North Sea oil revenues, record income & wealth inequality, deliberately under valuing public assets for privatisation, belief in trickle down economics, leaving the North to decline etc
9006 2018-06-17 17:48:07 can you mix with olive oil? about 50/50% is what I use for oil cleansing method (and I moisturize a ton in addition) but not sure if it would have the same lengthening effects?
9007 2018-06-17 17:47:54 Watching the US Open played at Shinnecock is like watching the Daytona 500 where they smear oil all over the track.
9008 2018-06-17 17:47:40 The case in the news is cannabis oil not CBD oil, meaning it also contains THC which is why it was seized at Heathrow.
9009 2018-06-17 17:47:40 my dad is doing an oil change on my car and everyone offered to bring me to work and i said it didn’t matter, anyone can take me. and my brother in law let me borrow his car instead!!! 
9010 2018-06-17 17:47:27 Aves3-7. I should be home soon I’m getting my oil changed but they are almost done I think
9011 2018-06-17 17:47:25 @Act_BBridge stop this nonsense please....the UK needs this oil
9012 2018-06-17 17:47:23 Realy and do you think we can beat the Arab oil? I don t think so. That means that some people still believe in the true and believe that Israel is your best friend in the ME
9013 2018-06-17 17:47:12 #bluedream sucking the last bits of oil I have left. Won't pick up again for 11 days or more... Detoxing for family visit.
9014 2018-06-17 17:46:51 Yep, Bush (via Zapata Oil).  Part of how and why they became so rich all these years.
9015 2018-06-17 17:46:42 അതല്ലേ ഞാൻ തന്നെ ഇട്ടത്.. പവനായി ശവം ആയിപ്പോയി ബ്രോ...നമ്മടെ പിള്ളേര് തിരിച്ചു വരും കുറച്ചു oil ഓകെ ഇട്ടു.
9016 2018-06-17 17:46:23 Yes but creating a token will not make it come out of the ground either. Tokens can be created to infinity just like fiat. Oil and bitcoin are the same except bitcoin doesn’t have a supply shock at higher prices.
9017 2018-06-17 17:46:15 Good!! Has he taught you how to change a tire and how to change your own oil too?

All things people, regardless of gender, should know how to do
9018 2018-06-17 17:46:05 You're burning oil already

9021 2018-06-17 17:45:50 Biafran oil belong to Biafrans, shithole called Nigeria have no oil, they are nothing but oil thieves.
9022 2018-06-17 17:45:42 Oh Ted. Nobody in their right mind wants Texas. Oil and gas are for the dinosaurs like yourself. The “hard left”( whatever that means) wants clean, renewable energy, vibrant economy, melting pot of races, the best education, clean air. Texas offers none of that
9023 2018-06-17 17:45:33 I'm trying. I'm wearing sun hats until they soak through, then switch to another one. Water is stashed around the yard so I don't have to go far. I alternate between shady and sunny parts of the lawn. I come inside for breaks. Smothered in rosemary oil to avoid the bugs.
9024 2018-06-17 17:45:04 This is the second time I’ve gotten an oil change in Georgia where the guy helping me is from Fayetteville. Both times, we just kind of looked at each other like “Congratulations for escaping.” #910

9040 2018-06-17 17:42:54 i diffused a ‘dreaming’ essential oil last night & I had the most beautiful dream but there was this song that played that was so amazing and everyone of my friends & I were crying about it cause it was magical and it hurts to not be able to find it :((
9041 2018-06-17 17:42:40 But the gays can have pride and say Jesus gay. This world going to hell in a wooden hand basket soaked in oil.
9042 2018-06-17 17:42:30 Pro tip: powdered peanut butter is an amazing ingredient for when you want to make peanut butter buttercream without mess of peanut butter. Other pro tip: ground cocoa added to dry ingreds + proportional veg oil added to wet ingreds in recipes calling for melted choc. YW!

9053 2018-06-17 17:41:24 #ROSE so with a market cap of circa £5m and CPR due out shortly. With potential JV partner coming on board for a drill in Q4 in an oil producing region. The market is still behind in picking this one up but not for long, massive re-rate due especially in current oil climate #OIL
9054 2018-06-17 17:41:18 Lmao I just want to go work on an oil rig
9055 2018-06-17 17:41:17 Yes. CBR 2018 growth forecast was 1.5-2 % for  a while also wither lower oil assumption. Should lift GDP incremently.
9056 2018-06-17 17:41:16 For those of you who don’t understand the magnitude of this win, this is the first time Germany has lost its World Cup opener since 1982, and are the reigning World Cup champs.
Mexico was lucky the German machine had an oil leak today!
9057 2018-06-17 17:40:49 The world’s fastest-growing oil consumer is guzzling down Iranian crude before U.S. sanctions start squeezing supplies from the Persian Gulf nation. India imported 771,000 barrels of crude oil a day from Iran in May, a 35 percent increase from the previous month. Stocking up!
9058 2018-06-17 17:40:47 I predict that oil will still be around long after you're gone!
9059 2018-06-17 17:40:42 Not smart honey...big oil as been paying the bills of #canada for years.
We are a resource based economy.
Royalties were shipped to Ottawa to pay the welfare cheques of the other provinces like QC.
$500B has been spirited from #alberta over the last 50 years.

9062 2018-06-17 17:40:23 my mom thinks I’m so high but like I JUST HAD SOME CBD OIL IM NOT HIGH
9063 2018-06-17 17:40:16 Yes, oil is a commodity. It is also a very capital intense and illiquid process of financing the operation to pump a physical barrel of oil out of the ground. 

Oil doesn’t come out of the ground for free.

9066 2018-06-17 17:40:04 ...4 group training should occur between municipal/regional exercises.

9071 2018-06-17 17:39:18 It's great seeing these 2 co-parenting peacefully! I just hope they don't try being a couple again! They don't mix well, like oil & water. Happy Father's Day Thomas! The gift was absolutely adorable, made me cry a little. 
9072 2018-06-17 17:39:17 Is the price per litre in India Rs. 74? It's Rs. 79 right now in Canada and that is a huge oil producer.
9073 2018-06-17 17:39:09 War criminal haftar terrorists set oil tanks at Ras Lanuf ablaze, bominig the oil terminal with deadly barrel bombs, igniting two Alhooroooj tanks, awaiting for the always worried, anglos, latins & romans to show their fashionably sincere worrisomeness in a joint _Statement.

9086 2018-06-17 17:37:41 Indeed, J-ME. This is a big company in the making. I just wish we could see a bit more oil in the mix. My back of fag packet calculations give each share a nav of £3 post this deal. Still more to come.
9087 2018-06-17 17:37:41 It is those that wish to do very little or nothing to protect our ecology - protecting instead big oil - who make up total fictions, and they've been doing so since they realized climate change and environmentalism posed a real threat to big oil.

9119 2018-06-17 17:33:03 The problem with using it as a cbd oil is the low thc content, some people require a high amount of thc to get rid of certain thoughts (depression and anxiety) like me, i tried a low thc oil (illegal) and it didnt do much to help with my anxiety +
9120 2018-06-17 17:32:51 Oil is a commodity. It has demand and fuels economies. And oil is the same as bitcoin. Nation states do pay each other in oil when fiat is not a choice. It doesn’t need a token either. It’s oil. 1 barrel is always 1 barrel. It’s doesn’t matter how many paper contracts you have

9135 2018-06-17 17:29:00 When you get the oil changed, it’s like getting a pedi, they have so many different ones you can choose.
9136 2018-06-17 17:28:45 I envy you! Took penetrating oil to get the adjuster out of a brake calliper, then tap and die to clean the threads. Both shifter triggers broken beyond salvation so fitted new ones. Missing a brake adjustor so will probably get new levers. Stand by for SHOCKING forks.
9137 2018-06-17 17:28:45 Big picture: the U.S. is importing less oil bc we're producing more of our own
9138 2018-06-17 17:28:40 My son-in-law, works in the oil fields and was a big Trump supporter before the election. Now he says voting @realDonaldTrump is one of the biggest regrets of his life. Also states that A LOT of his fellow oil-field workers feel the same way.

The voice of decency will win!

9155 2018-06-17 17:25:53 Lol, I agree.  We are behind on some things. 

Cannabis oil does not even get its users high; it contains no THC, the chemical that causes one to get high.  Really, c'mon...

9159 2018-06-17 17:25:31 Shame on you Nestle for buying palm oil from companies responsible for irresponsible deforestion. I’m boycotting you.
9160 2018-06-17 17:25:15 Perhaps the force of the wind. I’d check your valve cover for an oil leak. I’m not a mechanic. Just a thought.

9171 2018-06-17 17:23:46 The taking away the medication of the epileptic boy and finding out the PMs husband has links through the hedge fund to cannabis oil  and other ministers links to it,that only warrants the removal of May and possible fall of the Gov

9174 2018-06-17 17:23:41 Art tip: if you get art/writers block, try out different mediums. Try graphite, oil paint, watercolor, filming etc. just try new things and come back to your work later!
9175 2018-06-17 17:23:38 How dare you give further voice to this poisonous snake oil salesman.

9179 2018-06-17 17:21:56 "John was crowned a second time at Westminster at the coronation of his second wife, but like me wasn't anointed with oil again."

John had two more coronations, both at Canterbury. 

"Was your husband crowned again with you like John did or was yours a solo coronation?"
9180 2018-06-17 17:21:52 Eg you say Oil is illiquid, that is somewhat true of underlying in some areas, but nobody trades the underlying - futures (derivative) oil market is massively liquid... like most commodities BTW
9181 2018-06-17 17:21:50 Great example: cost of crude oil has only a symbolic effect on gas prices. In fact the price at the pump has not much to do with crude price.
9182 2018-06-17 17:21:45 Thank you, Christophe! No, I used the regular Oil, Pastel and Pencil tools with some of the settings tweaked to my liking. Things like how much paint is loaded, how grainy the texture of the canvas is etc.
9183 2018-06-17 17:21:33 #Libya: Oil storage tank 2 in Ras Lanuf port was ignited on Sunday amid continued fighting in the area, Reuters reports, citing Libyan fire officials.

9189 2018-06-17 17:20:55 ricalibrato almeno considerando (almeno) lo scenario di una forte crisi globale. Perchè ogni tanto si parla di italexit ipotizzando una domanda globale crescente (ma anche un oil alto) quando magari nessuna delle 2 condizioni sarà vera. Se l'idea è fare mini germania uhm.

9213 2018-06-17 17:18:10 I use deva curl and pravana oil. I live by a saying that said “oil before cream for frizz extreme, cream before oil for curls that coil” and I noticed a huge difference after doing it that way!

9229 2018-06-17 17:16:35 Oil is not illiquid because there is no way to trade it on a blockchain. It is illiquid because that's the demand/supply structure today. New assets types don't "create" liquidity; demand/supply creates liquidity

9255 2018-06-17 17:13:45 Yes, but if all u are doing is offering a ERC20 to represent equity in a company that owns oil barrels, then u are delusional if u think that will increase any value. Not even the liquidity premium will be represented on the block chain

9396 2018-06-17 16:52:25 Saudi Arabia will likely face economic hardship it's not due to the fact that they will run out of oil. Rather #technology will start eroding the market value of oil. Will countries like #Bangladesh and #India face a similar situation with #labor resource?

History lesson for Conservatives:
Native Americans never issued papers to Europeans who
came here w/their children/stole land & buffalo,:moved them to reservations, then moved them when oil was found!Brought Blacks here on ships in chains!
We’ve s criminal history!

9411 2018-06-17 16:50:52 Thank heavens you’re only pretty sure, or else coal and oil’s biggest friend would be at risk of losing his job. And.... I’ve made some very speculative bets in the market that are dependent on Pruitt or a Pruitt like dude staying in that job...
9412 2018-06-17 16:50:48 No oil in the German machine today #WorldCup
9413 2018-06-17 16:50:43 The real question is what happens afterwards and if oil prices will respond more to inflation pressures or to reduced economic activity starting second half of ‘19. (3/3)
9414 2018-06-17 16:50:07 I swear you men think by offering us women a “full body oil massage” will seal the deal
9415 2018-06-17 16:49:57 Nothing gets rid of the stench of old diesel oil like overly powerful vanilla shower gel.
9416 2018-06-17 16:49:48 And annointing oil
9417 2018-06-17 16:49:47 I love the tea tree oil face wash. Dealt with my breakouts really well.

9419 2018-06-17 16:49:24 have been there twice. it must've been spectacular in its day. the second time i went, olive oil from the groves must've been running. the air was intoxicating. my favorite place on Earth.
9420 2018-06-17 16:49:24 The German Machine needs dirty oil.
I tell you.
9421 2018-06-17 16:49:22 The oil glut will not resolve until the american pipeline capacity allows for more oil to flow out of Cushing and Permian for export. This is expected to happen by late ‘19 but we might find prices start dropping much earlier in anticipation. (2/3)

9431 2018-06-17 16:48:32 All this depends on what is considered “good.”  It is “good” that I had the ability to drive with my family this morning for a special Father’s Day donut trip. But is it good that it is an available choice bcuz USA does horrible things to get oil?  We have to think deeply here.
9432 2018-06-17 16:48:31 Three minutes for the oil to rescue a point. Doesn’t look possible but then, this is Germany.
9433 2018-06-17 16:48:31 #WorldCup2018 Any other EU leaders not visiting Russia to represent their respective countries squad? It is a big shame.

9438 2018-06-17 16:48:04 Some political careers might die.  Oka and Gustafson Lake and other conflicts where military has been brought in didn't achieve their goals.  There's wiggle room in getting Alberta oil to tidewater if we widen the discussion beyond this one poorly planned route.

9449 2018-06-17 16:46:25 @POTUS attacks OPEC on recent oil price rally whereas the primary factor in this recent rally is his political doing in Iran as well as the Venezuelan factor. OPEC will take a decision to ramp up production but it will not be instant. Fundamentals will support a continued rally
9450 2018-06-17 16:46:22 But once Scotland is independent, it can use its own oil & whisky money in whatever way it sees fit, rather than having to beg Westminster for tips from their own jar.
9451 2018-06-17 16:46:02 A great way that you can reduce the breakage of your hair is to put tea tree oil in your shampoo.

9474 2018-06-17 16:42:57 Par boiling and semolina is the magic combo for me. That and 50:50 oil and dripping roasting combo.
9475 2018-06-17 16:42:53 'Natural' Cannabis oil has CBD and THC.
9476 2018-06-17 16:42:38 @RachelNotley Could you please chime in? This is quite disturbing as your saying to all #Alberta NDP is pushing for a pipeline but we arent trying to stop the bill that specifically hinders our oil to ocean? @albertaNDP @DeronBilous @GlobalEdmonton
9477 2018-06-17 16:42:35 I've seen Thompson, Pfeiffer, and Sarandon, and I remember them to be great, on varying degrees (though memories of Lorenzo's Oil escapes me). Goldberg's the only non-nommed contender I've seen, and she was fab.
9478 2018-06-17 16:42:20 We need a change of engine oil , the machines are getting sloppy .
9479 2018-06-17 16:41:51 Ok distillate and delta-9 thc are still better than even mct oil I will not dab any fats even if they are good fats
9480 2018-06-17 16:41:44 All i remember about you is how you lacked ambition to play for top teams in top competitions in order to chase $$$$ playing for nobody teams in oil rich countries
9481 2018-06-17 16:41:27 #KabrasSugar and also all consumers in Bungoma and TransNzoia regions be careful with items you purchase especially the solid cooking oil most is expired and there is one supermarket repackaging and selling it. Caveat emptor!!!

9485 2018-06-17 16:41:00 No this helps immensely, I don't really have a point of base to really start off? I'm planning on buying some peanut butter powder since store bought peanut butter has soybean oil, I'mm look around for some protein powder too

9499 2018-06-17 16:39:05 Im not sure if this will be usedul for your sitch but both chocolate protein powders and scrambed eggs (oil & butter for softness). Were life savers for me for quick easy sustinance

9501 2018-06-17 16:38:53 So far all of the kiosks I've seen had 2 or 3 employees standing there to assist people in using them. Instead of one cashier working, it was like 3 cashiers working.
9502 2018-06-17 16:38:16 cbd oil recommendations ??!!
9503 2018-06-17 16:38:14 I would soak in epsom salt and gently exfoliate a bit. Then olive oil and Vaseline.
9504 2018-06-17 16:38:07 Dude says “zero evidence” of Oil interest, writes it up anyway. The other guy(?) says several sources, probably other low-rent bloggers or trade fabulists he messages with.
But then...Hall for Larsson, Eberle for Strome, Seguin for used parts, can’t say what Chia would do...

9510 2018-06-17 16:37:26 Always parboil and put into hot oil. Not tried flour but might give this a try.
9511 2018-06-17 16:37:19 While we’re at it pry 10 from the Oil for Psysk and Petro. Should be a very good player left there as well.

Imagine walking away from the first day with Zadina and one of Wahlstrom/Bouchard/Kravtsov 
9512 2018-06-17 16:37:16 Sure, you just need roasted pine nuts, parmigiano, olive oil and herbs. It's really simple.
9513 2018-06-17 16:36:52 "the squeaky wheel gets the oil."
9514 2018-06-17 16:36:40 I was talking about healthy omegas.  Coconut oil is healthy for you all around. People use MCT coconut oil for vitamin vape pens and for vaping essential oils.  Vaping coconut MCT gives you healthy omegas straight into your blood stream.
9515 2018-06-17 16:36:36 instead of buying tesco’s cheapest toilet roll like I usually do, I treated myself to some that’s infused with coconut oil n I feel like a new woman, wow who am I??? a queen!! I honestly can’t wait to wipe my ass with it.
9516 2018-06-17 16:36:26 You can source oil from US or other countries.

9522 2018-06-17 16:35:47 Who benefits from oil prices? Who benefits from total chaos in Middle East? You need to take an international economic and political course.
9523 2018-06-17 16:35:43 They changed the name of the med “Fish Oil” to “Omega Acid” and placed in another spot in the medicine section , but they marked Fish Oil at 90% off bc of the name change.

9524 2018-06-17 16:35:10 but still trying to make its’ taste & smell of motor oil tolerable. What is your favorite thing I should check into?
9525 2018-06-17 16:35:09 That's oil logic though

9530 2018-06-17 16:33:57 Why exactly was it important to dismantle Saddam. Was it important to steal all the priceless antiquities on Day 1 & illegally sell them to private collectors & to put the 2nd largest oil deposits in world (then) in hands of US companies. Puhlease. Iraq didnt do 911 or have WMD

9542 2018-06-17 16:32:51 So much better unsung olive oil for brownies than butter (though I lurve butter!) hope they come out well. I can't believe you had time to make them with all you had planned!!

9544 2018-06-17 16:32:35 Agreed: high oil prices would create instability in all the countries you outline.

9555 2018-06-17 16:31:12 You guys are quite far behind with the story. Since then he’s been granted permission from parliament to carry on using cannabis oil legally for the health benefits it’s bringing. Progress is being made people let’s stop being so negative!!

9569 2018-06-17 16:29:08 Good for you! PS Butter is better for you than olive oil. Restaurant oils are the worst. Oils are inflammatory -- some much more than others. To find out about this, read on "PUFAs." Cold-pressed extra virgin olive oil and coconut seem best if you need oil.
9570 2018-06-17 16:29:00 It’s odd Saudi would want to, but not surprising Russia wants to (especially since that’s what Trump needs to attempt to offset Iran mess). Either way - #Oil has already priced in the rumor off the highs, ...yet don’t they need unanimous decision with #OPEC anyways?! $CL_F $RB_F
9571 2018-06-17 16:28:53 Hope you learns from Venezuela-a country with the largest proven oil reserves in the world which is planning on importing oil and is close to hyperinflation

9585 2018-06-17 16:26:45 We rely on fossil fuels, and will for a long time to come.  We can increase our green infrastructure & capitalize on the growing demand for coal & oil.  We can do both simultaneously.  We are already leaders in green energy & fossil fuel production.  Why not make money?

9615 2018-06-17 16:22:20 @SecretaryZinke NO WAY would I tell you, or any Fed officials of my favorite park. It would get closed and sold to the ranchers and oil/mineral explorers like other great parks have been. BAH! Just another way for #TraitorToTheUSA to continue shredding this Country!
9616 2018-06-17 16:22:12 I was so hungry so I marinated some meat with salt, pepper, jintan putih, jintan manis, and some bbq sauce. Then pan fried it until cooked.

9620 2018-06-17 16:21:41 Yes! Coconut oil or Vasoline work too. If you're feeling up to leaving the house, you can find specific cream for cracked heels at drug/discount store.

9630 2018-06-17 16:20:09 So you still need this spelled out? You have LOW oil/gas prices with an impending HIGH demand season. You will want to then INCREASE production in your HIGH demand market, in this case the US.

9632 2018-06-17 16:20:00 Time to grow industrial hemp, give those soybean to china farmers something to do. Hemp wood is much superior, can withstand 300mph wind. Plus produces oil, and is capable of making us energy independent.

9651 2018-06-17 16:17:03 Thugs entered my truck & poured oil in my rest arm. A silk scarf was removed out of my compartment.

9670 2018-06-17 16:13:44 Gee...Texas was one of the states that outlawed CBD oil...until I filed a federal lawsuit against Cabal member Gov. Butch Otter (ID) for doing the same thing. Idaho violated the terms of some federal $ it took that stated that they couldn't ban ANY hemp products.

9674 2018-06-17 16:13:13 That would be a fine retort if oil prices were still going down, and if, when they did go down a couple of years ago, were at significant lows for more than a couple of months.

9682 2018-06-17 16:11:21 Since the 'West' imposed the Saudis on Arabia, the Saudis have made war on Yemen 3 times
This third time is likely to end like the last two times
The Saudi goal is to poses the vast oil wealth Yemen has, as the Saudi oil is depleted
Also, preventing Yemen developing own oil helps

9700 2018-06-17 16:09:39 I agree, let's come up with solutions here, who controls the supply of oil to our country and others? That's the start from me
9701 2018-06-17 16:09:38 The falling oil prices usually cause a reshuffling of rigs, ad on the US driving season coming up and that will mean corps want to keep oil moving the US without having to build rigs. Not rocket science.
9702 2018-06-17 16:09:35 Huh.  And here, oil companies are corporate sponsors of the Royal Tyrrell Museum in Drumheller, Alberta.

9740 2018-06-17 16:04:36 Nobody smokes lipids or fatty acids unless they are an idiot.  You can get lipid pneumonia. Of course, distillate is the best because it's liquid enough on its own and doesn't need a carrier oil.  You are saying "gross" to something that isn't happening. MCT is good for you.

9772 2018-06-17 16:00:18 Random etymology tidbit: 
“oil” is derived from the Latin root for “olive”, so strictly referring to “olive oil” is redundant. 

Meanwhile in Hindi, “तैल”, the generic word for oil, is derived from “तिल” (sesame).

9959 2018-06-17 15:41:07 No oil
9960 2018-06-17 15:41:07 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
9961 2018-06-17 15:40:58 Only if we all give up, but then they win... and no matter where you go, there you are. Mexico and Canada are rife with their own corruption which would metastasize if the prospect of absorbing CA etc was on the table. Trudeau is an oil man at the end of the day for example
9962 2018-06-17 15:40:45 Bio oil!
9963 2018-06-17 15:40:44 Hi Carl. Your pizza with caramelized onions and motor oil will be delivered in 23 min via car.
9964 2018-06-17 15:40:40 I want some cbd oil
9965 2018-06-17 15:40:31 2.) Russia didn't dump half its UST in a month and buy gold, China couldn't sell oil for CNY, and currency wars had not escalated to trade wars.  Other than that... nothing has changed.
9966 2018-06-17 15:40:30 子猫なら…あっやっぱ無理っ(逃
9967 2018-06-17 15:40:16 サラダ油に流されて変わってゆく私をあなたは時々遠くで叱って。
9968 2018-06-17 15:40:15 Now, if only one anointing with Holy Oil would make planes fly, lorries, buses and cars drive, power industry and make heating systems work, His Holiness would be in business.....
9969 2018-06-17 15:40:14 My oil derricks spit hot fiya
9970 2018-06-17 15:40:03 You know you're in trouble when you're already feeling like it's too hot and the coconut oil hasn't melted yet.
9971 2018-06-17 15:40:01 เหมือนจะแพ้อะไรแล้วเกาเลยค่าา
9972 2018-06-17 15:40:01 Boateng full of oil today
9973 2018-06-17 15:40:00 Nice.  Oil and gold haven't given me what I need lately so I threw up a few more charts.  HG is one of em.

9978 2018-06-17 15:39:30 Carbon tax if the Liberals can keep the oil flowing they can collect a tax..its pretty hard to collect a carbon tax on a solar panel or EV
9979 2018-06-17 15:39:29 Be like them for oil the machine.
9980 2018-06-17 15:39:28 Well heck yeah...Canada dun need no dem dare drillin rigs we gotz us plentea oh oil from dem marihuana hooch.
No workers required. 
Next libturd election winning ploy - free marihooch for all registered Canadians. 

That's great Chuckles, creating the Somalia of the North
9981 2018-06-17 15:39:12 I've know since I was a child the advertising industry want to blow up offshore oil rigs. TRUTH BOMB!
9982 2018-06-17 15:39:04 So the Western propaganda made you to believe. You weren't exposed. Travel there and see things yourself. I was there. He wasn't got rid of to free the Libyans. It was greed of the Western world, regime change, which they are not different from him. Sell their arms & cheap oil.
9983 2018-06-17 15:39:03 That is how I lost 15 pounds in 3 months....light carbs, light salt, heavy protein, greens, some booze....some eggs, some bacon, rarely butter. Olive oil.  Godiva and ZIn for dessert.
9984 2018-06-17 15:39:01 It does, but without the oil revenues in which Eck was counting in 2014, there isn’t an economic case for separatism. Wilson admits there would be a long period of austerity max before getting back to where we are now. Not exactly a good case for supporting separatism.
9985 2018-06-17 15:39:01 U mean all those ancestors who profited off of the free slave labor that built this country?  Or the ancestors who profited off of laws forbidding blacks from owning property?  Or ancestors who profited off of property stolen a 2nd time from indigenous ppl when oil found on Rez?
9986 2018-06-17 15:39:00 Bruce Lee once said that every time The Donald lies, a member of congress dreams about being a #Democrat
9987 2018-06-17 15:38:44 รอหยางมาขิงค่ะ
9988 2018-06-17 15:38:23 ดีใจด้วยค่าาาา
9989 2018-06-17 15:38:20 Yes to this. I let my hair dry naturally and use a hair oil like Briogio’s and mix it with Reverie’s Hair Milk. I also never brush my hair! (Except before I shower and then I comb it out when I have conditioner in it). But my hair is quite long and thick.
9990 2018-06-17 15:38:18 Then why is he focusing so much time on oil executives?
9991 2018-06-17 15:38:07 On my way to an engine oil for some maintenance work. Hopefully I'll be back in a jiffy

9994 2018-06-17 15:37:49 every time i have to go somewhere that’s at least 45 minutes away, my step dad always asks “did you check the oil?”. today, he leaves to start his job in mississippi and right before he left, i said “did you check the oil?”.
9995 2018-06-17 15:37:45 Tanga ko nisama ko sa sabaw yung chilli oil
9996 2018-06-17 15:37:41 Oil/ Fossil Fuel lobby owns the GOP. Now GRIFTER SCOTT PRUITT heads the EPA. In bed with his oil company buds. Using his office as his own personal bank account. FIFTEEN SCANDALS. BLOCKING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STUDIES. VOTE THEM OUT!!!!
9997 2018-06-17 15:37:33 Seen. I’ll look for it. Hope there’s no fake of the castor oil 
9998 2018-06-17 15:37:32 High birth rates in oil prospering muslim states + immigration from Afghanistan ? Pakistan ?

happy father’s day @Google!!!
10000 2018-06-17 15:37:24 Muka ko ata supply ng oil dito sa bahay eh
10001 2018-06-17 15:37:19 "Protecting children is our responsibility." Maybe stop sucking off big oil and giving yourselves a pay increase and focus on educational spending.
10002 2018-06-17 15:37:15 Let’s hope.
10003 2018-06-17 15:37:11 Another lie brought to u by Donald Trump, snake oil salesman and conman extroidinaire.
10004 2018-06-17 15:37:08 Machine not well lubricated... oil viscosity is too high
10005 2018-06-17 15:37:07 we live in a very peaceful time now, compared to wars in the past.  World wars never started over oil. with 7,5 Billion people and growing fast, it is amazing that it is so peaceful.  Wars will be, still, over religions and land.  Oil is a tool for man to use wisely or foolishly.
10006 2018-06-17 15:37:04 I can still smell the barber shop of my youth. Lucky Tiger, talc, and clipper oil, mixed with cigarette smoke.
10007 2018-06-17 15:37:02 Oil of Every Pearl's Un-Insides coming out and being good within a month of grimes totally shitting the bed publicly is karma
10008 2018-06-17 15:36:57 If #Heftar continues bombing #Libya -n oil infrastructures, Libya will dissolve for lack of resources to pay services and militias. A wave of chaos will spread from North Africa towards the Southern flank of Europe.
10009 2018-06-17 15:36:55 Rednecks would jump on that beard oil idea
10010 2018-06-17 15:36:49 Imwe tu mexico show them. The German machines are lacking oil apa

10014 2018-06-17 15:36:05 Oil prices are a predictive factor of an economy’s health.  Go do another line Cheeto.
10015 2018-06-17 15:35:55 I'm gonna have to resist to urge to twitterbate all day about the pros and cons of seasonal migrant workers. Bottom line is somebody needs to pick those avocados. They go bad fast. Have a good day sir. I'm sure we'll disagree again soon.
10016 2018-06-17 15:35:55 I hope you sink in an oil slick.
10017 2018-06-17 15:35:50 というかミリコレあと1万やんけ
10018 2018-06-17 15:35:48 My wish for an INDEPENDANT SCOTLAND is not about political parties ,football , oil or anything else for that matter other than to be governed by people in my own country without need of WM .My family & friends in other 3 countries within UK will still be there after #indyref2 YES
10019 2018-06-17 15:35:47 The machine needs oil or grease
10020 2018-06-17 15:35:44 Ever since the day he told me he was making it illegally I never used it, though I must say, you NEVER feel 'high' from CBD oil, it just calms you and whatever pains you have down!
10021 2018-06-17 15:35:44 You are confused by Snake- oil Tone's corporate version of "Hunt the Lady". Recon China has nothing to do with Aston Villa or ever did.
Recon Group Ltd owns Recon Sports Ltd who own Aston Villa Ltd.
Which "big" company would want to be associated with the car crash that is Villa?
10022 2018-06-17 15:35:43 อันนี้ดูจากไหนหรอคะ
10023 2018-06-17 15:35:40 Thought on CBD oil? #lupus #fibro #autoimmune

10028 2018-06-17 15:35:24 MacGyver would fix this with six bottles of olive oil, a barn full of leather watchstraps and a fencing mask.

10031 2018-06-17 15:35:22 Scientists are culprit to NOT have rolled out arguments which are powerful enough to explain how the present criminal global economy works, the impending catastrophe & thus need to change economy. Not just in US, or Trump: watch food (palm oil!) being turned into fuel by the EU!
10032 2018-06-17 15:35:08 I was dreaming and I was like wow this stinks. Is it oil? Was I eating something in my room?

and then I snapped out of the dream and my eyes flew open because I know exactly what this smell is and I was So Angry

10037 2018-06-17 15:34:30 I have been fasting in the mornings with some MCT oil added to my coffee.  Feels fantastic and clear mind!
10038 2018-06-17 15:34:25 Right. However, scientists are culprit to NOT have rolled out arguments which are powerful enough to explain how the present criminal economy works, the impending catastrophe & thus change economy. Not just in US, or Trump: watch food (palm oil!) being turned into fuel by the EU!
10039 2018-06-17 15:34:25 Dont get it if cbd is made legal now i cant see why thc oil isnt aloud..so much proof it works
