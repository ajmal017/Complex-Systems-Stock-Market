A great day to buy pot stocks!
4 2018-10-10 23:58:55 I was able to roll over 100% of my $40K+ 401K. Had my 401K been larger there wouldn't have been limits. I also did a Roth conversion to take the tax hit now rather than later. Once it's set up you can buy #Crypto, stocks, real estate, & other assets. My holdings are 100% #Bitcoin
5 2018-10-10 23:58:31 Tough day in the market. The bright side? Bargains can be found when healthy stocks are victimized by the larger sell-off. #StockMarket

39 2018-10-10 23:55:03 Well we saw what the Saudi government did when a Canadian Government Minister, Freeland, tweeted about the arrest of a human rights peaceful protester. A full pull out of Saudi students attending Schools, sell off of Canadian stocks, an over the top response.
40 2018-10-10 23:54:54 $34.00 per month. That's it. 
Since Trump signed the law reduced the corporate tax rate to 21%, CEO's have sold back their stocks in tens of millions of dollars. The big winners of the tax cut are the investors and top executives, not wage earners.
41 2018-10-10 23:54:28 If you are selling Amazon stock today, I think you may have lost your mind. That may be the best business ever built. Did you buy some "safe" utility stocks that will lose value when interest rates rise or another green regulation kicks in?
42 2018-10-10 23:54:12 Trumps tweets and takes credit for the stocks doing well. Crashed today and he’s been pretty quiet

44 2018-10-10 23:53:18 FYI, today DID NOT end any short term correction in stocks. NO bottom is in place. What is likely the new normal? The bull since '16, likely '09, ended last week, and today's slaughter was the "recognition" wave lower that a new normal isn't going to be pretty, nor short. The
45 2018-10-10 23:52:57 That is nothing to worry about! Only because the economy is so good people sold lots of stocks! It was expected! Means nothing!

48 2018-10-10 23:52:43 In the Heller case, the US SCt recognized that you have gun rights, but also those rights are limited. "It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever" Bump stocks were illegal under federal law, still are under some state laws and can be again under federal law.
49 2018-10-10 23:52:31 Fake news CNN only reports on stocks when they’re “plunging”
50 2018-10-10 23:52:20 Agreed. No wonder the stocks are going haywire.
51 2018-10-10 23:52:16 The deepest one-day selloff in Wall Street stocks in eight months has investors using the market equivalent of a dirty word: "correction".
52 2018-10-10 23:50:53 U.S. stocks just tumbled the most since February. The broad selloff took the S&P 500 to the lowest in 3 months, the Dow plunged over 800 points and the Nasdaq fell more than 4%.
53 2018-10-10 23:50:23 No.

Stocks are plunging because of sovereign bond buyers no longer trusting in our country because of Trump's far-Right agenda.
54 2018-10-10 23:50:07 Short Nike and long pot stocks, I was up 2.5%

56 2018-10-10 23:48:28 Don’t see you mentioning the drop in the stocks. Most on the news and winning @nytimes is not fake because we usually hear it from the horses ass.
57 2018-10-10 23:48:10 Sorry, I meant an external crash not specific to crypto. Who's to say that if stocks dump crypto will too instead of being bought, it is suppose to be "digital gold".
58 2018-10-10 23:47:57 Until now I didn’t see Stocks app. But now, I saw it. Actually, I should’ve not seen it... 
59 2018-10-10 23:47:40 anybody catch the wording "Single handed pistol" can you put stocks on some of the pistols and revolvers?
60 2018-10-10 23:47:37 This could be entirely possible. Given that stop losses are done on an automated basis it is not out of the question for them to push the indexes lower, albeit temporarily. Flight to quality. Watch value stocks and flight away from tech

66 2018-10-10 23:44:40 good news! you can also make money going down! puts made me hundreds of percents this week - day trade this market up and down - don't hold many (or any) positions over night until a full on crash is over (years from now). only swing trade individual stocks with significant news.
67 2018-10-10 23:44:25 Aust, EU,British and Asian Markets reacting badly to news that NYSE fall are so large, analysts world wide alarmed at overvaluation and overtrading ( dumping ) on NYSE. The large corporations are moving their stocks away from regular stocks and moving money out of America.

72 2018-10-10 23:43:26 Tech stocks dropped. Good day to listen to Moody Blues.
73 2018-10-10 23:43:09 Sitting at the dinner table and I over hear a group of old timers talk about the stocks they missed the boat on. I can’t help but to smile thinking how one day I’ll be able to tell my grandkids about the boat I caught #XRPthestandard #0doubt
74 2018-10-10 23:43:08 two different stocks i think so
75 2018-10-10 23:42:36 I bought because the stocks were too cheap to say no,  especially offshore drillers.
76 2018-10-10 23:41:39 if i get rid of bad energy around me, will my stocks go up???
77 2018-10-10 23:41:13 I’m gonna start charging people that want to meet up to get info on learning about Ecommerce, stocks or forex either that or find a mentor that’s gonna charge a high price or learn on your own cuz my time is way too valuable to even waste it.
78 2018-10-10 23:41:12 Well, those two days with my boy DIIIBIIIHOOOO paid off. Made 400,000 gold, and it still going as half my stocks haven't sold yet. 4 tokens, put into balance. I'm stockpiling, but value is value! 

Long boi can wait haha.
79 2018-10-10 23:41:08 The stocks may be down -800 points today, but at least my TEAS score is now 80% 
80 2018-10-10 23:40:56 Until a great number of people call for divestiture of these stocks from their 401ks nothing will be done!
81 2018-10-10 23:40:38 Let's face it... rich people have been treating FAANG #stocks like their personal savings account for several years already.

They know that they're expensive but where else are you gonna get 30% annually?

This is a potentially explosive situation!!!
82 2018-10-10 23:39:57 There's been an unlikely winning group of stocks during this rate-driven market rout ...
83 2018-10-10 23:38:11 I’m just not sure whether I should invest in Gold, silver, platinum, Uranium or semi automatic rifles and bump stocks.
84 2018-10-10 23:37:50 the stocks not doing so hot today
85 2018-10-10 23:37:06 If you have stocks SELL, market is going to tank, timing seems aweful close in my opinion to the next recession.
86 2018-10-10 23:36:50 I feel compelled to say this given the media attention to today’s stock market drop, “OMG! Stocks haven’t been this low since July 2018!”
87 2018-10-10 23:36:41 minus 3% !  that's all gains for the year for some traditional stocks.  oh the panic
88 2018-10-10 23:36:41 FANG correction? IWM small cap (mostly domestic stocks) almost lost its entire gain for 2018. Abit different from early Feb.
89 2018-10-10 23:36:40 Tech stocks tumble & Trump calls it a "correction" & says Fed is crazy for raising interest rates. You know what? I AGREE WITH THE PRESIDENT. Holy fuck. First time! Wait. Who appointed the Chairman of the Federal Reserve? Crap. It was dipshit Trump wasn't it? We were so close!
90 2018-10-10 23:36:00 It is not difficult to comprehend why the big refiners are investing in alternative energy stocks.  They understand that the time frame for fossil fuels is limited and to remain on-going concerns they must  invest in products which will sustain their cash flow.
91 2018-10-10 23:35:47 It’s called an adjustment. Stocks were hitting record highs. So it’s due to an adjustment which is why 2% loss is happening. We saw this earlier in the year for about two weeks then it came back up. Tech is overvalued.
Let me know when it drops 8-10% Boomer with no stocks. 
92 2018-10-10 23:35:41 It's in the Federal Reserves interest to crash the economy and buy out the country at pennies putting the country into War Debt.

Britain sold its country to bankers when their stocks got sold thinking Napoleon won the war.
93 2018-10-10 23:35:17 Last night yields initially crept higher as the stocks were down, then the traditional flight to safety ensured, with last trade at 3.176%. Currencies followed suit, a fight to safety saw the Yen as the strongest performer and the #AUDUSD declined slightly.

97 2018-10-10 23:33:30 What a day to own stocks 
98 2018-10-10 23:32:59 Diversify. Hopefully you had good advise from a professional like Edward Jones. Should have a mix of cash bonds and stocks.
99 2018-10-10 23:32:39 We will be in recession by 2020, and it will be a long and deep one. A market expert on CNBC today predicted stocks will drop 40% in this recession......  If nothing else, at least it guarantees Trump won’t be re-elected.
100 2018-10-10 23:32:06 The upward swing of stocks was three times higher under Obama than under Trump.  Trump rode Obama's crest.  Now Trump policies are taking effect, and it has become another Trump disaster!
101 2018-10-10 23:31:43 I may buy some stocks tomorrow that are at their 200 SMA and set a stop just under it in case it doesn’t hold. Looking for candidates now.....
102 2018-10-10 23:31:37 In bear markets, stocks return to their rightful owners. 
103 2018-10-10 23:31:35 This was forecasted by many, including @hughhewitt even before the inauguration...'stocks will rise, the Fed will step on it and we'llsee a correction.'

He did much better  prognosticating than @paulkrugman
104 2018-10-10 23:31:34 Probably a good one there. I actually did pretty good today and profited overall by  day trading $jnug . Kind of anticipated dip so had sold off dow related stocks and was pretty much clear of losses today
105 2018-10-10 23:31:34 I dont get the panic... if anything else it's a green to buy buy buy!!!! Have you been doing stocks sa pinas?
106 2018-10-10 23:31:27 Made 17k off some stocks. Hype
107 2018-10-10 23:30:59 So did he share with the great people of Erie PA that their stocks took a hit today?  Oh yeah- most people in Erie do not own stocks!
108 2018-10-10 23:30:45 Yes an environment where stocks, bonds, and Dollar all fall. If not now then never.

110 2018-10-10 23:30:04 depreciation of Chinese yuan was the turning point.
it was foolish to buy stocks after that.
111 2018-10-10 23:29:48 Notice it was the "nonsense stocks" that have no material product that dropped.---  G.E. (as far as it has fallen) did not drop in % as much .
112 2018-10-10 23:29:13 social media stocks took a beating today.Nothing from media when the dow hit records for 100 times.
113 2018-10-10 23:29:10 Trump should send out a Presidential Alert to only conservatives telling that he is going to come down hard on social media.  We can all short their stocks and watch them all cry like bitches.
114 2018-10-10 23:29:09 No interest is dissuading buy and holders on over-owned much loved stocks. Better to consider "At what price don't I love it any longer?"
115 2018-10-10 23:29:01 Great for a beginner.  Easy to use and no hassle.  I have a small account that I by small amounts of large unaffordable stock such as Amazon.  My kids use it for their small amounts too.  If you are buying lots use Robinhood or I've been using Webull for weed stocks and Moviepass
116 2018-10-10 23:28:50 U.S. stocks have been selling off recently due to a “risk off” tone, driven by interest rates.  Or more simply, we believe macro shifts are driving volatility.   

Reminder to stay focused on fundamentals. That's what fuels earnings power.
117 2018-10-10 23:28:15 Everyone knows what ever happens to big business effects the little man. If everyone is supposed to be happy when stocks and the economy is doing great because it means it's great for jobs, then that means everyone should be concerned when the #StockMarket is doing bad.

121 2018-10-10 23:27:15 Are you suggesting that there will be a market crash coming soon, judging from the price action of these stocks from today? Plausible but would there be more evidence?
122 2018-10-10 23:27:14 Hopefully this is tech stocks getting nervous because the federal government will crack down on internet & social media monopoly.

They deserve it colluding with democrats to effect elections.

3 out of my 4 largest holdings were positive, $SNS.v $ALO $SQG.v ! Altai $ati.v I added more today, some idiot sold on the cheap! 
Micro/Small Caps are perfect defence in a down market! #stocks
126 2018-10-10 23:25:24 Many “down home” people like myself don’t own any stocks. 
I could care less, really. 
But I know it shows a good economy. 
Dems are desperate. 
What better way to make Trump look bad:
“The market’s tanking folks; Look, Trump lied to you.”

Won’t work.

138 2018-10-10 23:22:39 When your stocks shoot up 62% to begin the day and then drop down 68% by the end of the day...

Thanks @realDonaldTrump this is your economy

143 2018-10-10 23:20:50 It’s not a problem if you never sell. #Stocks
144 2018-10-10 23:20:41 10% drop in all my stocks today nbd...
145 2018-10-10 23:20:41 When interest rates go up, stocks go down, it's a pretty simple equation.  China is in a little trouble here and they're doing a lot of selling and moving $ towards the yuan to try to prop it up. The Fed IS going a little crazy, and I rarely agree with the Don, on anything.
146 2018-10-10 23:20:33 I’m not sure the last time I wrote as many tickets as I did today...maybe 2011. Today was a game changer for stocks. It wasn’t a headline driven sell off and was pretty controlled. Exciting time to be a trader as volatility is back for good.

$ACRX, $RHE, $SRTY, $BLRX.
151 2018-10-10 23:19:24 Better off buying stocks and crypto
152 2018-10-10 23:19:21 Stocks will bounce back, Monday new highs. This correction today is too good to pass up by the pump and dumpers. This has nothing to do with any hidden tech agenda.
153 2018-10-10 23:19:12 Some stocks showing upward momentum on the daily charts to keep an eye on:

157 2018-10-10 23:17:42 Only Market Ignorant Investors Would Get Into The Market Now & That's Who Fox News Are Telling To Buy Stocks.  Yes FOX FIXED NEWS Buy Stocks In A Crashing Market.  The Dow Is Down 800 + Today And No Reason To Believe Fox Lies Will Spark The Stupid Investors To Waste Their Savings
158 2018-10-10 23:17:37 STOCKS DOWN TODAY 831.
159 2018-10-10 23:17:25 so the stocks are falling because the economy is good? I'll never understand the stock market
160 2018-10-10 23:17:02 The Fed didn’t do this. The market has been weakening for weeks, ie the advance decline line, high low, Mclelllan index. Technology stocks are not rate sensitive!
161 2018-10-10 23:16:39 After reading many comments, nobody knows, however selling of these large growth stocks at the intensity should not be occuring 5-10 days before earnings
162 2018-10-10 23:16:29 Forget Stocks and hold onto your Cash
163 2018-10-10 23:16:29 If you sell stocks this week you’re a dope. They’re on fucking sale. Been waiting all year for a buying opportunity
164 2018-10-10 23:14:58 Have to be ready to jump in and buy value stocks for sure!! Across the board there is value!
165 2018-10-10 23:14:25 So a potential pullback?? Still targeting 3k  don’t really know how to follow these type of stocks
166 2018-10-10 23:14:00 @pandyapradeep sir government trying to put subsidies burden of gas cylinder and kerosin on ongc and oil again negative for both stocks and market
167 2018-10-10 23:13:56 Benefits of a huge market selloff? Great entry points for buyers to get in on some great stocks. @Stash is a great opportunity to use this app to make partial purchases on the dips. #AMZN #BABA #AAPL #ATVI #NASDAQ
168 2018-10-10 23:13:56 Stocks close slightly higher, trimming earlier gains
169 2018-10-10 23:13:53 Maybe he doesn't own any stocks, but since the wealthy stole our pensions, stocks in our 403b and 401k are all we have, especially since the GOP are planning to give our SSN to their wealthy selves and friends, as if any of them need another effing dime.
170 2018-10-10 23:13:19 Wow, @realdonaldtrump, I'm so glad that my stocks fell today, what little I have, that is.  At this rate, I'll grow old and die waiting to retire.  Yeah, you are doing a fantastic job with our economy.  [sarcasm]
171 2018-10-10 23:13:13 I’m getting into penny stocks
172 2018-10-10 23:13:05 It’s the modern day stocks. If it doesn’t happen in the media it happens on social media.
173 2018-10-10 23:12:24 Today is a good day to buy some stocks.
174 2018-10-10 23:11:25 I guess you know more than the actual employees...and yes there are free stocks, I benefited from ESOP at a former employer.
175 2018-10-10 23:10:59 OCTOBER: This is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in stocks in. The others are July, January, September, April, November, May, March, June, December, August, and February.

176 2018-10-10 23:10:47 Don't be too hard on self, noted #StableGenius @realDonaldTrump isn't much of a reader either.
177 2018-10-10 23:10:34 ASX 200 falls 2.0% at open after Wall Street's worst day in 8 months. There'll be more on the ABC News Channel @abcnews #stocks #markets
178 2018-10-10 23:10:19 The years of "crypto gold" may be more numbered than I thought. What will be left is "stablecoins" (legal US dollar proxies), crypto stocks and real utility tokens, like blockchain computing resource shares (e.g. EOS, Ethereum).
179 2018-10-10 23:10:18 Still watching  @FoxBusiness and i just listened to @LouDobbs say “stocks go up, and they go down. But they are fine...Thank you mr president.”  are we serious right now? 

Now we are talking about the #deepstate and Rod Rosenstein? Wtf?! Is this even a #business channel?!
180 2018-10-10 23:10:06 Who bought stocks today?
181 2018-10-10 23:09:40 I mean it's kind of a disadvantage in that Lucario has only 2 stocks/the other player has to be able to keep their stocks for a long time.

But also Lucario kills at 50 after the first SD, much less IF he dies again before his partner loses a stock.
182 2018-10-10 23:09:39 Bitch we up $1.50 on these stocks I bought this morning. Fuck that broke shit idk how y’all do it
183 2018-10-10 23:08:45 The last person to complain to me about a bear raid was someone that was long $HMNY... I’ve been trading for almost 10 years now and you only ever hear this sort of “rational” with penny stocks. Every down move is shorts doing something illegal (something!).
184 2018-10-10 23:08:40 You must not read a lot, huh? And you clearly have *NO* idea about one-day price declines either. I, on the other hand, have been following the stock market for 20+ years, was a Wall St. Journal reporter & CNBC correspondent. I kinda think I get how stocks work #JustSaying
185 2018-10-10 23:08:05 People forget that stocks can go down LOL
186 2018-10-10 23:07:53 Lol at "stock market is going great". Has he looked at stocks today? 
187 2018-10-10 23:07:53 I’ve been busy all day and was not watching the news. Why are all my stocks in the toilet? Fucking hell, Donnie, what have you done now?
188 2018-10-10 23:07:24 For those of you that think this is a big decline and have only lived through relatively good times... in 87 the market closed down 22% IN ONE DAY... that's 5600 Dow points!  This ain't shit... it can always get worse.  Newbies have no idea of the inherent risk in stocks.
189 2018-10-10 23:07:23 Look for stocks that have good fundamentals that have been performing well. These will be the ones to offer the most potential when market bounces back.
190 2018-10-10 23:06:51 The PBOC can sell stocks too. What do you think?
191 2018-10-10 23:06:50 If only we could short words the way brokers short stocks. We'd all be rich!
192 2018-10-10 23:06:33 Yeah but now he's trying to smooth it over by saying we get a bonus if we've been there 5 years. Our stocks would have vested in 2 years and we would have made more money
193 2018-10-10 23:06:20 Last week it fell short by 40 points of reaching 27000 that has all bit been wiped out and people's stocks lost lots of money,  continue to see it go down bad times for the country are ahead and who created it all take a guess GOP Congress and Trump people this midterms matter!!!
194 2018-10-10 23:06:04 so did Gartman go long stocks Tuesday?
195 2018-10-10 23:06:03 @POTUS @PressSec Hey Fat Donnie while you are at your rally (instead of being in FL) tell everyone how well tech stocks did today in make am gr again bs. You are a joke. Do us a favor. Resign now
196 2018-10-10 23:06:01 Stocks is down today sheesh
197 2018-10-10 23:05:41 Brb selling all my stocks and putting all my money into bitcoin
198 2018-10-10 23:05:22 Was watching @AliVelshi today as he was watching the market numbers. He was very concerned as it be in a downward trend. Said to be careful with your stocks. Been seeing little bits of concern that the coming recession will be worse than the last. Look at housing. Philly is down.
199 2018-10-10 23:05:01 Don’t have to be rich to buy stocks 
200 2018-10-10 23:04:58 I read something about Netflix stocks dropping
201 2018-10-10 23:04:47 NEW YORK (AP) 
 Stocks suffer worst loss in 8 months as rising interest rates pull investors out of the market; tech stocks hit hardest.
202 2018-10-10 23:04:38 It would be unusual to enter a bear market without any signs of recession (indeed 22% US earnings growth in 2018). I have a feeling this is lots of trend trading algorithms derisking on volatility, and Tech stocks to bounce back strongly. But being a trend follower, I'm risk off.
203 2018-10-10 23:04:35 800 plus points today.  Maybe another 2-300 tomorrow.  Is this the beginning of the end of the bull market in stocks? The bond market seems to be signaling yes.
204 2018-10-10 23:04:33 A lot of these stocks are overpriced, I'll never understand Tesla's price. They may take a bitcoin type dive.
205 2018-10-10 23:03:33 He obviously has stocks in Health Care Insurance companies.
206 2018-10-10 23:03:02 I think you have to learn that there's a company behind every stock, and that there's only one real reason why stocks go up. Companies go from doing poorly to doing well or small companies grow to large companies.  - Peter Lynch
207 2018-10-10 23:02:41 Pot stocks weren't the hedge today. Or cryptocurrencies.
208 2018-10-10 23:02:30 My theory is 12/21 cause stocks move on that date to avoid Capital gains tax to be reinvested. 1+2=3 & 2+1=3 again 33 Most don't know a US dollar has a eagle on the back. 32 feathers on one side & 33 on the other. All this stuff is a coincidence?? You decide
209 2018-10-10 23:02:11 Clarification, Wells Fargo( where I have a broker) as a corporate will not purchase marijuana stocks.  I'll have to investigate on my own. Thanks.
210 2018-10-10 23:02:00 The rich that sat on their stacks of money that are now jacking up the numbers by buying their own stocks are enemies of the state. This is a fake boom that will be proven on Nov. 6th when they dump all their money out of the economy to try to make republicans look good.
211 2018-10-10 23:01:24 Many whining, no not winning, Liberals out love to blame Trump for everything like today's non-crash of the stocks. Like the NFL, it's good to see the big tech companies take a hit. The market is still at record highs kids.
212 2018-10-10 23:00:47 Why are stocks so madarchod
213 2018-10-10 23:00:42 Um, having a 401k (presumably invested) by definition means a person does have (presumably) some exposure to stocks. Unless they put all their $$ in cash or fixed income; that's a whole other problem. But folks w/401ks are *NOT* the ppl I'm referring to. And a job? 98% r smallbiz
214 2018-10-10 23:00:19 man, what an eye popping bloodbath. stocks absolutely massacred today. was a good day to come in flat and buy deep OTM, one-day puts on the $SPY as it rolled over.
215 2018-10-10 23:00:15 Holding 3 longs, closed red on about a fifth of my risk. The stocks are strong but this is seemingly more than a few % correction in the markets. Might just sell it all in the morning and wait for better conditions. #trading #stocks

221 2018-10-10 22:59:32 None of my stocks lost any money today. Because I’m too poor to own any stocks.
222 2018-10-10 22:58:40 Thank you David Muir @ABC for saying twice that your 401(k) took a big hit today. Because that’s exactly what small investors with money safely tucked away for retirement need to hear. Panic! #stocks (pssst, don’t do anything. Sell in  panic and you will regret it)
223 2018-10-10 22:58:36 We see it a lot on interlisted Canadian stocks & AMEX. Impossible 2 borrow in Canada 2 go short but once listed on AMEX not uncommon 2 see 20% of issued shares short on AMEX.  Naked shorts. ETFs will disappear Bcuz they R the biggest abusers of electronic shares 2 keep costs down
224 2018-10-10 22:58:30 U.S. #stocks tumbled the most since February. The selloff led the S&P to its fifth straight loss, the #Dow sank over 800 points and the #Nasdaq plunged 4%. 
And by the way it’s the world mental health day!
 #WorldMentalHealthDay
225 2018-10-10 22:57:37 I hope you don’t get rekt dude. Why would you buy/hold something at ATH? How much higher can stocks/fiat go before a collapse?
226 2018-10-10 22:57:29 And you got your wishes. Did you buy in a meaningful way or are you waiting for stocks to go a lot lower?
227 2018-10-10 22:56:13 Omg besh I was also thinking of investing in stocks... What kind of sorcery is this? And also, did you win yesterday?

229 2018-10-10 22:55:41 As US stocks tumble in 4 out of last 5 days. Could this be the unravelling of the Trump presidency ?

231 2018-10-10 22:55:32 Added to XLK, and I bought a couple Tech name cult stocks. BTFD till it doesn’t work anymore!!
232 2018-10-10 22:55:25 With the sharp fall in stocks, people will look for alternative investments/ store of values. This along with @BAKKT could help kick start the bull market #BTC #XRP #VEN
233 2018-10-10 22:55:15 Remember someone is buying when the stocks sell off. Takes two sides to make a trade.
234 2018-10-10 22:55:04 Which is it? Interest rates have been rising fast for over a year. Stocks move in reaction to rates. #StockMarket Read a book before commenting on things you know little about #WednesdayWisdom
235 2018-10-10 22:54:57 Everyone thought that #Cryptocurrency would rally when the #StockMarket got crushed. Welp that didn’t happen. Do you really think investors are selling their stocks and then thinking its time to buy #Bitcoin ? A recession won’t cause people to double down on #Crypto
236 2018-10-10 22:54:18 Just got off the phone with my dad who has more Apple and Amazon stocks.

They’re secondary market movers.
People in tech buy their high margin products. If tech gets wrecked, they hurt and then hurt again when tech workers don’t buy their products in the future.
237 2018-10-10 22:54:10 I exited FAANG MTN and was poolside in the safe harbor of cannabis stocks hehehe MTN= MSFT TLSA NVDA <- u heard it here first :)
238 2018-10-10 22:53:58 Stocks move at incredibly slow paces. Mostly due to the fact that they have opening and closing times in the day. Significant moves like this one are a bit rare, but often show a sign of what is to come, eventually.
239 2018-10-10 22:53:41 Gotta keep saying this: If you're under 45, investing in stocks and won't need the money for 20 years at least, every big market decline is your friend, not your enemy.
240 2018-10-10 22:52:51 I think at this point inflation hot print would help stocks: lower real
241 2018-10-10 22:52:44 Just a friendly reminder to all followers check all open orders. Some stocks I am following look to be gapping down a fair distance on open.
242 2018-10-10 22:52:18 Housing and auto company stocks are behaving like a catastrophe lies ahead. Not since 2008 has such a rapid drop in stock prices in these huge industries happened
243 2018-10-10 22:52:11 He will say it's not his fault when stocks go down, only when they go up.  What a butt head.
244 2018-10-10 22:52:04 Trump today on the market drop "It's a correction that we've been waiting for for a long time."  Funny, I missed the warning when he's been tweeting all this time to take credit for stocks rising.
245 2018-10-10 22:51:51 Long-time readers recall the test sequence the avgs usually go through that provides a clue as to whether a bottom is being formed. Part of that is for the number of NYSE 52w lows to diminish as the avgs move lower. Something to watch for #stocks
246 2018-10-10 22:51:48 Please go out and vote!!! These  republicans don’t give a shit about us and they are corrupting our country. Stocks are at a all time low because of trump ! Please go and vote ! Your vote does matter

249 2018-10-10 22:50:59 Not exactly. For starters, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummets, that's *not* affecting the whole economy. The Dow is made up of just 30 companies. Also, most elderly/grandparents/retirees are *not* heavily invested in stocks. They're more likely to be mainly in bonds.

257 2018-10-10 22:49:45 Notable that today's big drop in #stocks was accompanied by a strong bid in US Treasuries - a classic "flight to safety" or "risk off" pairing. In other words it seems unlikely that today's market stress was a function of the commonly cited "higher bond yields" narrative of late.

260 2018-10-10 22:49:10 Personally, I generally avoid long positions on stocks that can’t hang onto the 200D SMA.  $T being a good example how it can be an arbitrary barrier to price.  It rejected it last week.
261 2018-10-10 22:49:02 FANG stocks performance today:

268 2018-10-10 22:47:44 Maybe a bad day but check the nikei and the London stock exchange and the other stocks may not be so bad know space stocks are fine
269 2018-10-10 22:47:34 Tech stocks have their worst day since August 2011
270 2018-10-10 22:47:03 Trump Takes Swipe at Fed as Stocks Tumble #thewallstreetjournal
271 2018-10-10 22:46:35 OMG! Melbourne Mayoress is fruit cake. Only thing Vic Market needs 2do is put tiered car park under current carpRk +get rid of Asian junk stalks..get back to crafts +unique stocks. We don’t need anymore ppl in Vic- especially those who can’t speak English+non compatable Culture
272 2018-10-10 22:46:20 ERIE, Pa. (AP) - President Donald Trump says after stocks drop that Federal Reserve 'has gone crazy,' says markets in 'correction'
273 2018-10-10 22:46:08 The relative strength index (RSI) has hit its lowest readings on all the major indexes in over three years. Get this: every reading below 30 on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 has been a perfect time to buy stocks. Today’s RSI hit 23.0 and 24.3 respectively!
274 2018-10-10 22:45:14 This is the most ignorant fucking thing I've read all month. Stocks don't just affect investors, they affect EVERYONE. When stocks fall, prices inflate.
275 2018-10-10 22:45:13 Or cannabis stocks
276 2018-10-10 22:44:51 Not so plot twist: Money leaves stocks and crypto to buy gold etc like it has done always for hedging crashes.
277 2018-10-10 22:44:51 Stocks screens have collapsed over the last few days.  Be patient and wait for setups!  It’s not a 100m dash but a marathon!!
278 2018-10-10 22:44:14 Lot of the tech growth stocks looking enticing now. Once a deal is made with China..lookout.
279 2018-10-10 22:44:00 Not a fan of using a single exit strategy when trading stocks.  There is no perfect exit strategy...each stock acts differently.  Let the price action tell you.

281 2018-10-10 22:42:07 Omg stocks dropping for no reason ! No one complained when it went up for no reason !!!!! $spy
282 2018-10-10 22:41:44 My stocks haven’t been doing too good 
283 2018-10-10 22:41:41 If you’re mad, here’s all I have to say: In America, it’s BEZOS’ company, and he calls the shots. If you’re mad because your paycheck is short, feel free to leave. You actually have the freedom to.

But, that feels like a greedy shot to take both bonuses & stocks.
284 2018-10-10 22:41:35 @DavidGFool @TomGardnerFool Yaay! Stocks are going on sale!! *grits teeth*
285 2018-10-10 22:41:20 I, personally, am looking forward to a full on correction so I can get some discounts (or maybe closer-to-actual value) on some key stocks and ETFs.
286 2018-10-10 22:41:17 OK. I surrender. I shall see if Ocado stocks it.
287 2018-10-10 22:40:24 If you have $50K in stocks would you ever dream of paying a $15K commission to sell them? It doesn't really make sense to treat your homes equity any differently. Spending tens of thousands of dollars to release your home's equity makes a mockery of the term "largest investment".
288 2018-10-10 22:40:07 In 2009 Waters had helped OneUnited CEO Kevin Cohee secure a meeting to ask for $50 million in bailout funds to recover from the Great Recession, triggering a House ethics investigation. (The bank did get $12 million.)
Her husband had a huge share of the stocks.
289 2018-10-10 22:40:06 Hi Mr el-erian, do you think tech stocks like amazon, Netflix, tesla, facebook, etc are worth their shares prices and reflect the real economy?  Also how is it that we are at the same interest rates in 2008 but this time leveraged with more debt and no concern? hmmmm
290 2018-10-10 22:40:02 What a bloodbath it's been the past few days! Out of all stocks with the exception of $T and $VZ, only ones I feel safe with right now
291 2018-10-10 22:39:58 Agree. When mkt crashes, everything goes down including U stocks.
292 2018-10-10 22:39:50 Stock vs. bond prices have become coupled in recent years. Stocks and bonds both fell together in the past couple of drops--the only safe haven was in shorting various sectors and betting on the Vix.

295 2018-10-10 22:39:14 stocks been down for days
296 2018-10-10 22:39:01 That’s what I thought but just wanted to make sure because I seen a bunch of puny stocks today so I think I need more expertise :-) and you’re it :-)Thank you Tim! You’re the best!
297 2018-10-10 22:38:40 If you get nervous about a 5% decline in your net worth then maybe  stocks aren’t for you
298 2018-10-10 22:38:38 Wednesday saw the steepest drop in 8 months for stocks on the #NYSE. Trade concerns in #China are pummelling the #tech stocks and rising interest rates are being blamed  #USA #investing
299 2018-10-10 22:38:16 Might be time to pull out of certain stocks until the market corrects.
300 2018-10-10 22:37:47 Amazon raised base wages but took away monthly bonuses and  free stocks...employees are saying they ended up with less. Look it up.
301 2018-10-10 22:37:30 I LOST SO MUCH IN STOCKS TODAY WTF.
302 2018-10-10 22:36:51 Plus the tariffs are causing inflation problems... We need to resolve China. We also need Dems in power in the Congress - believe it or not I think that will be better for stocks.
303 2018-10-10 22:36:36 This happens over and over in the markets and with many stocks, never gonna change
304 2018-10-10 22:36:18 Stocks having the Meltdown.! tRump thinks it all time high again ..
305 2018-10-10 22:35:50 The only thing that keeps market afloat is 3m  and core cpi differential. We still have inflation 1.6. thats good for stocks.
306 2018-10-10 22:35:44 I keep telling myself that when I realize profits - especially when stocks are choppy/still running but hey some money is better than none !
307 2018-10-10 22:35:42 @jimcramer 
Hi Jim. Is it too early to buy and hold BZUN or some of the other beaten down  tech stocks in China for the long term. Thanks for all of your daily advice! Maureen NJ
308 2018-10-10 22:34:51 The other troubling event today was Treasury auctions saw less demand than expected. Lack of buyers, perhaps because they think rates are going higher still. Not good for stocks or companies that carry debt.
309 2018-10-10 22:34:10 I hate that "Dow Jones" is trending right now. It should be S&P 500. Media really needs to stop using the Dow as their go to for informing consumers. 30 stocks is not a good gauge for the overall market.

312 2018-10-10 22:33:16 haha, its been a great few years for stocks.  If you are one of the few dumb enough to not take some profits, then it's on you.
313 2018-10-10 22:33:06 Thank you! I wonder how many people remember the incredible volatility of the first quarter & how much stocks were over-valued then. Unfortunately, that's still the case.
314 2018-10-10 22:33:06 $AMD This is what cramer does. tells u how great these stocks are near the highs then how bad they are after the fact at the lows
315 2018-10-10 22:33:01 Just watched the open of Nightly News and it’s bad headline after bad headline: a hurricane, the manslaughter of 20 people, the stocks plummeting, and babies getting really sick and we don’t know why. It’s beginning to not feel real anymore.
316 2018-10-10 22:32:10 @realDonaldTrump "Stocks sank Wednesday as a steep decline in tech shares and worries of rapidly rising rates sent Wall Street through its worst day in months." Hey!!! Where's your tweet on this huh???? LMAO
317 2018-10-10 22:32:00 U.S. stocks tumbled the most since February as fresh concern about the impact of the trade war with China roiled technology and industrial shares. Treasuries rose with the yen amid demand for haven assets.
318 2018-10-10 22:31:57 Stocks have plummeted. DOW had the 3rd worst drop in its entire history today
319 2018-10-10 22:31:49 It’s crazy how I used to base my investment advice on them when I was into stocks.
320 2018-10-10 22:31:43 RIP to all the tech stocks and just the stock market in general today holy shit. 
321 2018-10-10 22:31:35 Sold some puts on stocks I own already.
322 2018-10-10 22:31:34 Glad to hear ya say this - hope you are right. Still buying the dip and trying to spread it out and not try to time the bottom.

323 2018-10-10 22:31:28 Maybe most Americans don’t own stock, but maybe their parents or grandparents have pension funds or retirement accounts invested in stocks. Or maybe the places retirees shop will go broke because retirement funds are wiped out. Huge stock loses affect the whole economy.
324 2018-10-10 22:31:07 The Dow fell more than 800 points, with tech stocks hit hardest. 
@realDonaldTrump said that it is a needed market correction
325 2018-10-10 22:30:54 In market massacres the Stupid worry about stops and margin calls... the wise worry about which stocks to buy

341 2018-10-10 22:27:57 @realDonaldTrump simple fix. The damage will be done. People will freak out and start selling their stocks, and take it out on the Right in the mid-terms. Then the Dimms will pick up these stocks at  least one-third less then they were. I guarantee this IS what is going on!

344 2018-10-10 22:27:19 A Look At Why Stocks Plunged On Wall Street
345 2018-10-10 22:27:15 Indices (stocks) del New York Stock Exchange han ganado durante todo el 2017 al 2018. A veces por grandes margenes. Medios chatarra de PR @NoticentroWAPA y @TelenoticiasPR nunca han sacado tiempo para informarlo. Dow perdio hoy por 800+ puntos y lo informan a modo de celebracion.
346 2018-10-10 22:26:33 I bought amazon stocks, thank you very much.

This naysaying old fart is mad because MS funded and collaborated with SCO in a blatant attempt at destroying Linux (among many other transgressions).

I understand "new management", but it's still hard to forgive.
347 2018-10-10 22:26:13 RT @EmilyFoyd: Is really sucks that @Tastyworks doesn't automatically calculate and warn about Good Faith Violation (#GFV) before I make a trade for options or stocks, Fidelity has that, a lot of brokerages does too, so I never have to worry #GoodFaithViolation with them.. H…
348 2018-10-10 22:26:08 I panicked, sold all, lost thousands, market sucks!!! I’m sitting on cash. No dividends no stocks, now what! (3 mos later) Wallstain reports “Economy stable DJIA jumps highest level percentage in 20 years to 30000 ”investors jumping in DJIA hits 35000 on earnings 

Hypothetical?
349 2018-10-10 22:26:07 @BarackObama Yo Obama hows your mama, thats a joke.The reason the gray beard bull market got spanked today is the yield on the Us long bond has nearly doubled which causes selling of over valued stocks pumped up by financial engineering. Now you know.
350 2018-10-10 22:25:37 No you don't. 90% of  firms trade on OTC (US) markets. $CGC trades on NYSE & Aurora will move there end of month, as $ACB I think. Can use a big online broker to trade intl exchanges urself.

Your broker is badly misinformed.

See ETFs too. $HMLSF $MJ, stocks in same sector
351 2018-10-10 22:25:37 Higher yields caused stocks to selloff, duh. I wish I went through a trading day and only saw one thing I didn’t understand
352 2018-10-10 22:25:27 Sentiment surely has changed vs. this time last year. A lot less "benefit of a doubt" for tech stocks & their growth path
353 2018-10-10 22:25:14 They know the majority of their supporters are the poorly educated, right? Where are they gonna get money to buy stocks? Pawning their scooters? However will they shop at Walmart?
354 2018-10-10 22:25:05 I think that the fact that a TV personality on CNBC - who used to trade #stocks during the period when there were no #ETFs or #3x #derivatives - can come out on TV and say that "He understands things better than the #Fed" is quite seriously mind-boggling.  Retweet if you agree.
355 2018-10-10 22:25:00 tech stocks are bloodbath rn
356 2018-10-10 22:24:56 Absolutely on the money - pun intended. Stocks are tremendously over-valued. 

I won't invest until this lunatic is out of office.

362 2018-10-10 22:24:28 what you really are saying is todays bloodbath was more of a technical reaction to algos triggering when key SMA levels of ETF indexes were breached.  That fundamentals of stocks are still strong and the upcoming earnings season will prove such and get the market back on track

375 2018-10-10 22:22:42 Wall Street never says stock market is fleecing the average American. 800 points down today calling it a "normal" pause. Really.

377 2018-10-10 22:22:22 U.S. stocks plunged Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average recording its largest single-day point drop since February.

381 2018-10-10 22:21:28 @cvpayne you know it takes me 8 months to get gains in my stocks and the FED can open his miuth and say something stupid and take all those gains away in five days. That is not right.
382 2018-10-10 22:21:05 But what about the mantra "buy low, sell high"? Wouldn't this be a good chance to get in to the market or buy more stocks?
383 2018-10-10 22:20:59 Maybe,a lot of factors cd b at play. I worry about higher interest rates. Corp CEOs loved cheap interest,bought their corp stocks back driving up profit. With higher interest,are they cashing in now on the stocks?
384 2018-10-10 22:20:41 No we are 10’years old now I did not say it will go boom I just said put it in the market will mature you would still make more than you would in stocks
385 2018-10-10 22:20:15 Looks like China is tired of buying up American stocks and bonds to boost Trump. Wait until China dumps all there shit and crashes the market.
386 2018-10-10 22:19:58 Stocks fell 3% today? And the TSX has ~300 stocks and ETFs trading at 52-week lows. So this is what happiness feels like.

390 2018-10-10 22:19:34 I'm not even bothering with Stocks too much at the moment - it seems far to dangerous to be buying in any size (if at all) and probably best to spend time researching potential Buys for a few months time. I guess it's not 'boring' anyway  ;-)

403 2018-10-10 22:15:57 Rate hike is silly in this economic sitsuation. When bonds are suppressed easy money keeps floating to stocks, because there is no  else place to go.. or is there Mr. B  
404 2018-10-10 22:15:56 Tightening monetary policy because they're worried about inflation being a threat to the economy.  Just buy bank stocks and don't worry about it.

#t2107 stocks above their 200 dma = 38 this is almost as extreme as it gets ...
408 2018-10-10 22:14:38 Who trying to help me do that stocks shit ? 
409 2018-10-10 22:14:20 @realDonaldTrump Here ill help you. The reason the stock market got spanked today is the yield on the long bonds has nearly doubled which means tecnical factors will move institution money into bonds out of stocks.
410 2018-10-10 22:14:12 Excellent time to buy commodities, specifically natural resources. #uranium and #copper are my favorite long-term prospects right now. And a good time to take a look at tech stocks some of which are taking a beating! #BuyLow
411 2018-10-10 22:14:06 Don't know what he means by bank but many of the cannabis stocks rose sharply in July and August. If you bought $CGC from last year, back when it was $TWMJF you're way ahead.
412 2018-10-10 22:13:41 Who woulda thunk it... Trump taking credit and bragging about stocks every week may have been a bad idea.
413 2018-10-10 22:13:31 @realDonaldTrump takes ALL credit for rising stocks but no responsibility for reckless policies that produce uncertainty and losses. #BlameTrump
414 2018-10-10 22:12:37 All stocks are down
415 2018-10-10 22:12:34 It seems Real Madrid dodged a bullet with this Cristiano Ronaldo drama. Juventus is catching heat with their stocks dropping.
416 2018-10-10 22:12:32 When market resolved these stocks will run up like nutcase $nflx
417 2018-10-10 22:12:03 he admitted he missed it, that it was a bull trap in hindsight. And I have total respect for @ToneVays , just saying its possible that this is more than a pullback in stocks.
418 2018-10-10 22:11:57 Some good stocks were stopped today and losses were booked or profits vanished. Many lived to see tomorrow. Trust the process and follow the plan. Remember this day, write it down, and bring it back when you're cheering the wins. $STUDY $HUMILITY
419 2018-10-10 22:11:50 Everyone is always asking me when to buy stocks bc it's like my job and I get that but I hate giving friend's free advice. Kinda shady but it's my livelihood lmao here's your one free tip. Pay extra close attention to the market this week. Value stocks not growth!!  FUNDAMENTALS
420 2018-10-10 22:11:32 @traderadio no wonder pies delistings and re signing players such a muck mess
need to get there priority right either may coming or not move on from it if beams coming no way give a trade of 19 pick given pies midfield stocks
421 2018-10-10 22:11:28 FTSE Yielding 4% at current levels.....May dip my toes in FTSE ETF if it goes to 6600 … it is safer than buying individual stocks with quarterly dividends..
422 2018-10-10 22:11:02 Republican economics 101; 1: Borrow trillions to give tax cuts to billionaires. 2: raise interest rates to entice buyers of debt you just created. 3: cry foul when investors move money out of risky stocks into your self induced inflated bond prices. 4: Blame Democrats. 5: REPEAT
423 2018-10-10 22:11:01 Ha. Stocks are on sale 
424 2018-10-10 22:10:58 "Stocks have worst day since February
U.S. stocks fell sharply on Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 832 points, or more than 3%. The S&P 500 fell 3.3%, while the Nasdaq was off over 4%."
425 2018-10-10 22:10:54 President Donald Trump says after stocks drop that Federal Reserve 'has gone crazy,' says markets in 'correction'
426 2018-10-10 22:10:50 When American are not allowed to live much less consume companies suffer thus stocks decrease.
427 2018-10-10 22:10:50 Trump's right of course. Seven Fed interest rate hikes since Trump elected and more promised by Powell. It's too far, too fast. US rates highest in the developed world by far. Obama got one Fed hike in 8 years. Crazy policy. And political. #stocks #MAGA
428 2018-10-10 22:10:33 Vast majority of stocks have been trashed over the past three quarters already, even with beating earnings and forecasts, talk about dousing a fire. Why not have a controlled bonfire for awhile? How many rate hikes in the past 24 mo.? 7?
429 2018-10-10 22:10:20 La conclusión a sus post, es realmente muy preocupante, la producción saldrá a la caza de los pocos pesos que sigan girando......se irán cayendo de a varios a la ves hasta terminar sus stocks, previa desocupación sucia, la suerte ya esta echada
430 2018-10-10 22:10:04 this man it's playing in stocks. I told you.
431 2018-10-10 22:10:03 @realDonaldTrump you criticize the fed for rising rates in the strongest economy the world has ver seen where so far every data point is well below all prior cycle levels in housing, autos, GDP & more. This is a debt created shit farce of an economy. Stocks are not real.

433 2018-10-10 22:09:54 #TYTLive I'm absolutely shocked that Chris Hayes was actually allowed to cover  this killing by his corporate masters. I thought they'd be scared to  death their oil stocks would be revoked.
434 2018-10-10 22:09:16 His buddies will buy stocks and he will say something to make them go up.
435 2018-10-10 22:09:13 I can’t imagine dumping my stocks into this market, the pump and dump schemes would destroy my previous investments.
436 2018-10-10 22:08:45 I bought 2000 shares of $TNA at the close. I'm willing to wait for a short spell for it to bounce back so I can make a profit with some leverage behind it. Not in for long just for it to give me a bounce. Looks like stocks with rate hike/China revaluing. No bear market IMO.
437 2018-10-10 22:08:14 Soon we will look back and laugh at how cheap some #ASX stocks are ATM!
438 2018-10-10 22:07:34 stocks were pretty defensive rotation - 4th day in a row.

440 2018-10-10 22:07:16 I'd like to interject since civility is an option, economy isn't good. Example, Ford. We're down in our stocks an astounding 8%. We lost money on stocks that roared under O. He ruined us with the tarrif b.s. We're fireman and lawyers, not dumb shit ppl. He's no biz man, never was
441 2018-10-10 22:07:14 Do all these asx commodity spec investors realise commodities trend with the equities markets, yet bulls everywhere calling runs on these types of stocks..... oblivious
442 2018-10-10 22:07:07 loving this drop. so many stocks that I want to buy now!
443 2018-10-10 22:07:03 U.S. stocks closed far lower Wednesday,10/10/18: $DJIA -3.15% (-831.8) at 25,598.74, $SPX -3.29% (-94.6) at 2,785.68, $COMPQ -4.08% (-315.9) at 7,422.05.
444 2018-10-10 22:06:46 Yes. Over the last 5 years, I have been doing lots of light profit taking. I am approx 50% bonds, 30% physical gold, 30% physical silver, and the rest in cash. Only 20% stocks.
Money/investing is a personal thing. Everyone should determine their own level of risk.
God bless you.
445 2018-10-10 22:06:40 Dow dives 832 points today, our 3rd worst point drop in history. All 30 Dow stocks were in the red today. In part, AI (artificial intelligence) & robotics (ie. automation) will continue to impact, disrupt & affect our economy. It's time to have bold, new, & viable proposals.
446 2018-10-10 22:06:28 #stocks #Fed 

He has to blame someone...this should not be surprising.
447 2018-10-10 22:06:15 It’s because a big investor is dumping their stocks. In anticipation of the potential profit decrease,associate with the tax war the us is raging against China
448 2018-10-10 22:06:13 Lucky you! All of my bio stocks are B R I G H T red! Today I opened some smaller positions short DAX, short SPY.
449 2018-10-10 22:06:10 Absolutely Pete, but a Depressions could care less about fundamentals. Ask the common #U investor if they can wait another 5 years before stocks takeoff ? Fear > Greed
450 2018-10-10 22:05:58 Stocks tend to go up the escalator and down the elevator
451 2018-10-10 22:05:35 Stocks at all-time high: "It is because of ME that its high. RECORD BREAKING numbers! Best Ever!"
Stocks are taking a big hit. Plunging numbers: "The stock market doesn't really have anything to do with presidents. Unrelated!"
452 2018-10-10 22:05:06 not to worry we're at levels we were at in August just 6 wks ago ... if the market was to drop 20% we would still be above 20,000

Dragged down by the Fed rate raise "Still Low" & Tech stocks dropping 5%

breath ... the sky is NOT falling
453 2018-10-10 22:05:04 That's debatable. Today, a lot of stocks went past "healthy pullback".
454 2018-10-10 22:05:01 The Dow fell more than 800 points, with tech stocks hit hardest, Some investors wonder if the bull market may finally be ending.
#Shocking
455 2018-10-10 22:04:56 what about the fact that stocks AND treasury bonds went down which basically never happens? How do you know this isn't capital flight out of the US.? and why is volatility good if you aren't a trader?
456 2018-10-10 22:04:00 And look at the stocks today -831
457 2018-10-10 22:03:40 Headlines don't seem to mention that people are selling stocks and moving into bonds it has nothing to do with the shape of the companies.
458 2018-10-10 22:03:22 If you know anything about markets then you know rising interest rates have a direct impact on stocks.
459 2018-10-10 22:02:49 #DONTPANIC but if the #SPX sell off pushes #China stocks to new lows, remember all those loans taken out v share collateral.

460 2018-10-10 22:02:37 You're right. For months now, there has been absolutely no doubt in my mind that the Dems wish, really wish, the economy tanks. Pretty sick, given they all have stocks, cut my nose to spite my face.
461 2018-10-10 22:02:35 Literally calls the Fed crazy for a 5% drop in stocks but doesn't call them crazy when stocks rally 300% since the last crisis on Fed craziness
462 2018-10-10 22:02:22 Stock market got crushed today.  Worst one-day swing in possibly eight months.

Issues with market today:

Ton of overvalued stocks that are overinflated.

Some of these stock prices are unheard of especially, when taking a deeper dive into their balance sheets.

I have to admit, I was a little upset at first because I was already making above $15/hr but I also didn't know that I was going to be getting a raise, & I was going to be able to keep the stocks that I had already earned.
465 2018-10-10 22:01:23 See, now I truly believe you're on point with the stocks after seeing you.. ya beard on some Abraham Lincoln shit and connect perfectly with ya hairline, next payday I'm hitting you up 
466 2018-10-10 22:01:19 Yeah. It fell all the way back to August! OMG. Ya know, if you had any brains you'd buy stocks tomorrow and ride it out. Unemployment numbers, great. GDP great. Stocks are on sale and this is an opportunity. This was predicted to happen along with a fed rate change...
467 2018-10-10 22:00:51 Also the funniest thing today is our President said the Fed is going crazy--NO they aren't, and should have been raising rates long before now & "HE CAN'T FIRE OR THREATEN THEM AS THEY ARE INDEPENDENT. Stay long the Yen & short the Nikkei! #Commodities #Yen #Nikkei #Stocks #Panic
468 2018-10-10 22:00:48 maybe, maybe not. But you can't sell stocks, settle trades, and move money via wires to crypto exchanges that fast.

470 2018-10-10 22:00:21 Stock market is only one of many indicators. Some of my stocks went up today.
471 2018-10-10 22:00:16 Et c’est peut-être pas plus mal, l’émission énorme de CO2 provoqué par une guerre mondiale sera compensée par la diminution de population, les carburants fossiles seront utilisés massivement donc les stocks épuisés. Et des bombes A tactiques peuvent provoquer un hiver nucléaire

474 2018-10-10 21:59:29 All im saying is QT (quantitative tightening) we have 1 more round this year, and 3 more next year. By Q4 2019 its unsustainable, stocks could/will bounce back tomorrow but the narrative remains the same... the debt bubble is fracturing and eventually it will explode...
475 2018-10-10 21:58:42 Thought I was buying pot stocks these last two years.. turns out I was just buying weed smh
476 2018-10-10 21:58:34 from my experience, I’d say it’s a very small correlation or plain opposite. Markets sell off, people panic and stay holding or sell off to keep cash or switch it to MJ stocks and hope for runs there
477 2018-10-10 21:58:20 Stocks today...not so great. Here's some wisdom from #MarkTwain "OCTOBER: This is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in stocks in. The others are July, January, September, April, November, May, March, June, December, August and February."
478 2018-10-10 21:57:51 Not a chance if stocks continue to fall. Like throwing gasoline on a fire.
479 2018-10-10 21:57:48 You guys on Fastmoney & Halftime have been pushing stocks through the stratosphere, namely Techs with nose-bleed valuations RIGHT UP UNTIL YESTERDAY even though YOU ALL knew we are dealing with CHINA'S TRADE ABUSES.  And today, youre all baffled because your portfolio blew up?
480 2018-10-10 21:57:36 Lets rush to buy the 3% pullback in MEGA CAP stocks up 50-100% YTD, trading at insane valuations relative to growth... what could go wrong?
481 2018-10-10 21:57:30 As for the market, he owns it since the tax cuts, companies are creating a bubble by buying stocks back and artificially inflating numbers, btw, how much is the DOW up this year since the cuts? Let me know. How much did Obama grow the DOW & cut unemployment v trump, TELL ME
482 2018-10-10 21:57:17 2/ In all markets, fundamental value and price converge and diverge.  In the tech boom for example, even quality stocks like Amazon became wildly overpriced and then collapsed even as the underlying company was becoming stronger.

5. Be patient 
6. Sell crypto and buy cheap stocks

495 2018-10-10 21:54:42 I've been waiting with money on the sidelines for this debt shitpile to eventually erupt as it does. Then my intention is to put that money to work buying more reasonably priced stocks.
496 2018-10-10 21:54:30 Although I feel the bear is here, I won’t be selling any stocks. Cash is coming soon and I’ll add to my short SP500 hedge and already hold Utilities which seem to have gone up today. I feel I’m covered so aside from #AMO and #XLM causing issues I feel comfortable with the risks

All 30 Dow stocks were in the red, sending the index below 26,000 points for the first time in a month.
501 2018-10-10 21:52:31 Dow dropping, NASDAQ more than 3%. Oct is tax selling season esp Tech stocks. It will have a meltdown now because people will start selling and cashing in their stock , sugar high tax cuts made it indices go this far up
502 2018-10-10 21:51:56 Nothing re: Tech stocks? I'm in the habit about asking that because of my concentration on them during my IBM tenure. The weather excuse makes sense, only if there are commodities that are in short supply becuz of it..

503 2018-10-10 21:51:52 Trump won’t allow stock indexes going lower with mid term elections in November . Everything oversold with no news , I still hope an end of the year rally and good performance in the 3 stocks I own : $AMRN $FNKO $SENS .

S&P 500: only 17 stocks closed in the green out of 500. 
Spiking bond yields, lower equities. What's/who's to blame?

@POTUS just came off AF1 and said: "the Fed is making a mistake. I think the Fed has gone crazy"
511 2018-10-10 21:49:52 Yes sellllll sellllll your stocks. Mwahahahaha. Sell them all so I can buy them cheap. Stocks always go up. People are scared idiots. Oh well, free money for everyone else.
512 2018-10-10 21:49:21 theyre also the only platform I've seen that does intl stocks, crypto, and options
513 2018-10-10 21:48:19 Always wanting to blame others. I heard it was tech stocks and the tariffs that caused it, HIS tariffs, NOT The Fed's 
514 2018-10-10 21:47:46 ERIE, Pa. President Donald Trump says after stocks drop that Federal Reserve ‘has gone crazy,’ says markets in ‘correction’.
When the market goes up it is thank to you when it goes down it is the FED's or the Democrat's fault or a Soros' Conspiracy, S&P500 down 5.1% since Oct 1st
515 2018-10-10 21:47:44 Are you shorting stocks? You are a joke! Look at stock market.@realDonaldTrump
516 2018-10-10 21:47:43 My stocks are radically down. Im not even looking. In fact, im thinking it could take a year or so to recover. Theyre really not good. Not  dreaming of buying anything as would need to sell first!

522 2018-10-10 21:47:03 Trump blames the Federal Reserve (and his own appointee Jerome Powell) for the Dow's 832 point decline. 
 
“The Fed has gone crazy," Trump says. 

(Note that the Fed has interest rates currently at a range of 2 to 2.25%, which is still well below historic norms)  #stocks #Fed

The Dow's biggest single-day drops in history
528 2018-10-10 21:46:06 When stocks go up it’s because of Trump and when it goes down it’s because of Federal Reserve. How combiner. Can #TrumpBlindFollowers see this?
529 2018-10-10 21:45:47 Stocks suffer worst loss in 8 months!  Where's your tweet on that #DUMMY?

532 2018-10-10 21:45:00 Stocks on major world markets slid to a three-month low on Wednesday, with the benchmark S&P500 stock index falling more than 3.0%, its biggest one-day fall since February.
533 2018-10-10 21:44:57 Most stocks are on sale now.
534 2018-10-10 21:44:54 Yes, people took their profits by selling stocks. Do you own any???
535 2018-10-10 21:44:51 I sure picked a great day to check in and see how my stocks were doing. WTH happened, @kairyssdal?
536 2018-10-10 21:44:21 U.S. stocks closed far lower Wednesday,10/10/18: $DJIA -3.15% at 25,598.74, $SPX -3.29% at 2,785.68, $COMPQ -4.08% at 7,422.05, $RUT -2.18% at $1575.41.

538 2018-10-10 21:44:00 Im excited to see all the local money mangers who have no idea what they are doing direct their clients money in a market that does not go straight up like they have been accustomed to. There are a handful at best that even know how to research and analyse stocks.

545 2018-10-10 21:42:50 I'm sure he'll brag about that at his next rally. "I had the HUGEST drop in stocks ever! Let Obama claim that!".

548 2018-10-10 21:42:27 When investing/trading, rule number one is never put all your money in stocks. Market corrections usually happen every seven years. Plan, prepare, do a lot of research.

550 2018-10-10 21:42:19 Flip floppy,distraction desperate Trump. Scapegoats Powell for rightly raising rates>blamed for stock selloff

Trump praises Powell one day (if stocks are up),bashes the next with “Fed has gone crazy”

He constantly bashed Janet Yellen, yet says this FED should be independent
551 2018-10-10 21:41:52 Stocks' broad slump means upcoming Q3 earnings reports become that much more important. Investors will be looking for companies to sound upbeat about the outlook.
Otherwise ....
552 2018-10-10 21:41:52 I think stocks recoil from here for at least a month.
There’s too much sentiment that they’re over valued.
Too many people believing that investing is the way to afford an overpriced house.

Too many other countries in the world seeing our stupidity.
553 2018-10-10 21:41:44 I really wish I would of started investing in stocks a long time ago.

555 2018-10-10 21:41:31 Stocks plunged Wednesday as investors grew concerned over rising interest rates and hints of a pickup in inflation.
556 2018-10-10 21:41:16 To myself this guy is a big time con. These stocks have put on ridiculous market caps while Americans haven’t gain a single penny. We are suffering for the past 10 yrs. Even the bush economy was better than this and that sucked too
557 2018-10-10 21:41:10 My stocks stop doing badly cmon neodaq.
558 2018-10-10 21:41:01 No.  The bull market is driven by supply/ demand fundamentals and even if a few planned/ proposed reactors are pushed back there are over 50 being constructed now to be completed in the next couple of years, plus utes have major uncovered demand coming up.  Stocks will catch up.
559 2018-10-10 21:40:59 I love looking at my stocks grow 
560 2018-10-10 21:40:45 They say when Trumps market rises. 
That stocks don't a president make
But when it dumps a downer
Then Trump is at the stake
561 2018-10-10 21:40:37 Hope you're right, but I fear this could be the beginning of a global crisis that would be disastrous for #U stocks, even if you think they can't go any lower than they are.
562 2018-10-10 21:40:35 Oh, come on people.

It's obvious Trump is saying the Fed is crazy so he can deflect blame on to them if stocks/economy continue to sour.
563 2018-10-10 21:39:57 @JohnLegere ... think you could help teach @HMNYHQ1 how to disrupt the movie industry?  My stocks are in the toilet with them, but T-Mobile stocks are doing phenomenal... help them please!
564 2018-10-10 21:39:45 Stocks are down because you can't do a massive tax cuts and tariffs at the same time. POTUS is a bozo. A serious clown.
565 2018-10-10 21:39:35 I guess one good thing about the market fallout is it took me a fraction of the time to get through my post-market scans tonight. How about you, @EDWARDTRILEY? #silverlining #stocks

568 2018-10-10 21:39:28 Maybe your Liberal Reps and their mega rich cohorts are messing with stocks to punish Trump! I’ve been expecting this tactic next.
569 2018-10-10 21:39:09 #Rebound Tomorrow should be a BIG UP DAY in all stocks. I've never seen a down day of 830 followed by another down day.  There will be squeezes across the board. BIG DAY. my #1 and #2 picks $sq and $amzn for big rebounds
570 2018-10-10 21:39:06 Do you think that there is a market downturn because whales are liquidating stocks so they can buy into crypto?  If this is the case, considering it takes about 3 days to get money into an account after selling a stock, we should see a crypto climb by Monday or Tuesday. #xrp
571 2018-10-10 21:38:59 US stocks tumbled o/n with the S&P500 & Dow marking their biggest daily declines since Feb & tech stocks were at the centre of the carnage. Ahead of the local open SPI futures are 109 points lower at 5,914. #ausshares #stockmarket
572 2018-10-10 21:38:54 Oh please let it keep dropping before the midterms perhaps god is helping us? Or perhaps the rich have run out of their play money on the stocks!  That’s what ya get for over stimulating the market unnecessarily!
573 2018-10-10 21:38:53 Now that stocks have fallen...for a reasonable fee, I’m available to explain precisely why they’ve fallen.
574 2018-10-10 21:38:51 Did that happen during the last economic crisis ? No, everybody went into cash. Even if it seems ludicrous, #U stocks could go way lower...
575 2018-10-10 21:38:06 (AP) - President Donald Trump says after stocks drop that Federal Reserve 'has gone crazy,' says markets in 'correction.'
576 2018-10-10 21:38:06 Is this why tech stocks tamked today?
577 2018-10-10 21:37:56 Either am I, but not sure how much effect marketing campaigns have on stocks prices.  Sales, yes. Stocks? Not so sure.
578 2018-10-10 21:37:52 Growth stocks (FANG) are running out of steam as the outlook for bond yields continue is up, up and away.
579 2018-10-10 21:37:51 Any thoughts on $SSTI ? Weed stocks ?
580 2018-10-10 21:37:44 Well, Luke, down she went...will taxpayers be drafted into buying stocks to keep the dividends flowing to the well off?    Probably on the table!
581 2018-10-10 21:37:27 US markets have been getting a bit ahead of themselves again. Correction was always on the cards. ASX has done not a lot so not a lot to correct. Sheeple will sell though so time to secure quality stocks at a bargain.
582 2018-10-10 21:37:26 They will listen to the markets, as they always do. But they will do the opposite of what Trump tells them to do.

Correction in stocks = hike less likely.
Trump tweeting = hike more likely.
583 2018-10-10 21:37:22 Okay. But due process is granted to people not guns. Bump stocks, ARs, fully automatic machine guns etc etc, aren't people. Nowhere does it say any and all types of weapons in any number or capacity is a right.

587 2018-10-10 21:36:18 Makes me wonder if the Fed has some members who Hate President Trump so much they agreed to raise interest rates in order to see stocks plummet. Tough day for the economy but still have faith in long term stock prospects.

Is the SAG-AFTRA pension fund invested in gun makers stocks?

Thanks Steve
592 2018-10-10 21:35:35 It's the start of something long overdue. Buying Amazon at a trillion or $990bn doesn't make it a bargain. Momentum stocks will come off 20%+
593 2018-10-10 21:35:34 We all know a big crash is coming – the question is when. Rates are rising, stocks are falling (having their worst day in 8 months), and the economic data is starting to turn. #stocks #bitcoin #trading
594 2018-10-10 21:35:24 Clearly stocks are spooked by higher rates and maybe some inflation that seems to be creeping in, BUT dont forget that these tech stocks that are pretty down are definitely the best performers

598 2018-10-10 21:34:52 Stocks close lower as Dow sinks over 800 points in worst day since February.  Other financial markets dipped all in response to the Feds raising interest rates.  @realDonaldTrump has stated that the Feds did not need to raise the interest rates so quickly.  I am not a broker.

622 2018-10-10 21:32:09 I predicted this.......I have told many, that to expect a crash in the fall......and I know nothing about stocks
623 2018-10-10 21:32:08 Too late Con Don.   Stocks suffer worst loss in 8 months as rising interest rates pull investors out of the market; tech stocks hit hardest, and it's projected to get worse. Yesterday you said inflation is not a problem remember? F.U. buddy.
624 2018-10-10 21:31:38 i look at it as period of shifting from hypergrowth scenario to more moderate growth - some different stocks needed in portfolio now. re: bonds, i don't think that 3.25 is killer on the 10 year but usually the bond market anticipates future Fed moves, so this seems normal to me.
625 2018-10-10 21:31:35 Efficient Markets Hypothesis would say that investors should have known that October would be a spooooooooooky month for stocks
626 2018-10-10 21:31:27 Could be. Early days yet. But Gold isn't falling with stocks as it did in 2008, at least not so far. But Silver did today.

633 2018-10-10 21:30:03 Make sure you explain to them why their stocks and bonds sunk like a rock today.  Are they tires of winning, yet?  What about your cronies?
634 2018-10-10 21:30:01 Honestly, all up to USD/CNY now and that's a black box. But if stocks do #crash here and now and the #Fed is forced to reverse policy causing the dollar to plummet, #Gold is likely to soar imho. So far Gold not going down with stocks as in 2008 but early days yet.
635 2018-10-10 21:30:01 Stocks still falling in after-hours
636 2018-10-10 21:29:57 Why do I need to look you up? For what? No I'm not in retail like you I'm in the financial sector. Sorry I'll break that down for you. I work with stocks, mutual funds, IRAs, 401ks.  Does that help ya out fluffy?
637 2018-10-10 21:29:49 that was one of the ugliest days in recent memory for stocks...
638 2018-10-10 21:29:39 Sorry Bill your wrong. Stocks are undervalued and we have a blue light special. Dow will end year around 28,000.
639 2018-10-10 21:29:36 This sensitivity is not well understood by most discussing trade war dynamics.  US has strong hand as long as stocks rising.  If stocks fall, US quickly has weakest hand.

656 2018-10-10 21:25:43 stocks surge to record highs in record time, then hit a little speed bump and people are calling it the 'end of days'... long-term people, long-term

658 2018-10-10 21:25:33 What’s funny is 4 outta 6 of my stocks ended green
659 2018-10-10 21:25:30 They don't care, he speaks what they want to speak. They want white power and no consequences. Most of the MAGA ppl I know of don't own stocks so doesn't matter if up or down. The tariff is starting to hurt though, they still blame China even though Trump started it. #VoteBlue
660 2018-10-10 21:25:21 All the companies bought all their stocks back. 1% wont even feel it.
661 2018-10-10 21:25:18 I don't understand. Falling knives, yes. But falling stocks mean many investors eager to sell, which means buyers can get shares cheaply...at least, if they can afford to buy and wait for prices to rise again. Even a slight rise can mean profit.
662 2018-10-10 21:25:17 Watchlist 2018/10/11. Market got a whipping. Weed names on wl are green. 5 day romp $spx $djx $ndx. Bounce or have we entered a bear market?  $tlry $cron $igc $nbev $ygyi. Investment flowing out of stocks. Dip opportunity considering earnings season almost upon us.

664 2018-10-10 21:25:03 "Normally, a stock market sell-off sets off a buying spree in Treasurys, as investors look for security in the more steady government debt market.
But that's not the case now, since Wednesday's sharp plunge in stocks is actually happening because investors have been selling ...

685 2018-10-10 21:19:44 I just went to look at my stocks...I'm gonna need a moment with some chocolate pudding.
686 2018-10-10 21:19:40 but rt tech stocks as a whole are getting hammered
687 2018-10-10 21:19:28 To add to that, I'm not making fun of the stock market nor do I wish for a stock crash. I never would. I actually like stocks. I'm only referring to those who claimed money was better spent on the stock market (some have said this for 2+ years) and that BTC was going to zero.
688 2018-10-10 21:19:05 Stocks crashing, money flowing to crypto ? 
689 2018-10-10 21:19:02 I’ll say this as well.  The relative volume in most value/div stocks, even if red, was low.  The volume in growth and tech sell offs was MASSIVE by comparison.  If they’re gonna rotate and not just flush everything (TBD), start shopping value/div names.  JMHO
690 2018-10-10 21:18:54 Which stocks bro, if you don’t mind me asking.
691 2018-10-10 21:18:53 It's not the economy that's "almost too good," it's the oversold stocks because of people over-participating (or getting ahead of the market). It will recover almost instantly. Fundamentals are SOUND. It's a great time to own American businesses! #KAG2018 #RedTsumamiComing2018
692 2018-10-10 21:18:48 Dow goes up Dow goes down that's how stocks work
693 2018-10-10 21:18:34 Boy, you need to think long term. Twitter is UP more than 50% from last time this year.  The reason why Warren Buffet is the way more successful at stocks than you is partly that he looks at the long-term intrinsic value. Good luck.
694 2018-10-10 21:18:29 Interest rates are rising.
Tech stocks are overvalued 
Trump replaced Yellin on the fed reserve with someone who spooks the markets more.
695 2018-10-10 21:18:25 Is he getting free sample from pot stocks?
696 2018-10-10 21:18:21 Did you see $FNGD today — up 16%. —- Nice ! Gold mining stocks were green also
697 2018-10-10 21:18:13 Buy weed stocks! Strong today!
698 2018-10-10 21:17:30 No, he’s not.
If the economy is as good as Trunp says, rates should be higher.
Tariff concerns are also spooking the market.
IMF report is concerning to investors.
Stocks have run a LOOOOONG way, and many are probably overvalued. A bit of a decline/rest is healthy for the market.
699 2018-10-10 21:17:09 i'd have to say that making a 401(k) with @Betterment is a regret... these people have lost me 3-5% while I've made 42% this year... they still had me at 90% stocks/10% bonds in the midst of a market meltdown. i just reallocated the whole thing myself lmao
700 2018-10-10 21:17:07 At my age going to the supermarket picking out some green bananas is long term planning. I want my stocks to go up every day, every week, every month, otherwise I don’t want it.
701 2018-10-10 21:16:55 I've done them all, futures, options, commodities. I always liked being the house and selling options. I live in Colorado, so I totally get the pot stocks thing. I went to cash a week ago on my crypto holding. Probably no trades until November. That and I'll be on Vacation soon.
702 2018-10-10 21:16:54 Boy, these guys dont get it. 
Market structure was vulnerable, rates provide an alternative to stocks, emerging markets submerging, ambiguity of global economic growth, pivot of global monetary policy, massive leverage in public/private sectors, US policy to disrupt order
etc.
703 2018-10-10 21:16:39 Do stocks get three strikes?
704 2018-10-10 21:16:35 I vividly recall March 2000 when Clinton/Blair popped the genomics bubble and sent #biotech stocks into a tailspin, declining by 12.5 percent in one day. Just a reminder, not a forecast...
705 2018-10-10 21:16:32 Nice slogan.  Not necessarily true though.  History is ripe with examples of the free market wiping out (or nearly so) entire stocks of resources (whales, cod, hardwood trees) or damaging the surrounding environment so that innovation because necessary for survival.
706 2018-10-10 21:16:08 I just checked my stocks and 
707 2018-10-10 21:15:56 Under armour only dropped 5.  Just an example.  Some stocks actually finished positive.   Just because market dropped doesnt mean individual stocks did
708 2018-10-10 21:15:51 I believe the DemonRats will attempt to crash the markets with the help of leftist working at the feds along with wealthy Dem's selling off stocks in unison right before midterms
709 2018-10-10 21:15:49 Today's market selloff is a correction in a bull market as the US econ is VERY strong. BUT ALSO DUE TO TRADING SHOWS (CNBC Fastmoney) hyping up stocks, namely Tech stocks to nosebleed valuations IN THE FACE OF China trade issue  @realDonaldTrump @stevenmnuchin1 @DonaldJTrumpJr

711 2018-10-10 21:14:37 Thanks for joining the conversation Knox. Did you mean bump stocks instead of bulp stocks. I don't know what a bulp stock is.
712 2018-10-10 21:14:02 Blood bath accelerated in the last 2 odd hours in the general market. During the whole day $DNN + $ISO + $LAM were not down much but it had a separate mini crash in these stocks in the last hour.

724 2018-10-10 21:12:03 Uhm Brexit happened before then.  That' was pretty unstable politics.  The Eurozeone was in big trouble.  The BIG reason now isn't poltics.  The Fed has raised interest rates.  Bonds look more attractive than stocks.  

IF corporate earnings hit their targets we'll be fine :)

731 2018-10-10 21:10:33 i don’t know a single thing about stocks but i do know it’s all fake
732 2018-10-10 21:10:27 What is still concerning here is that the bonds are not really going up... The selloff in stocks cannot really stop before the long term yields start pulling back some. Dividend yields are barely becoming competitive now... $TLT $TYX $SPX $SPXTR
733 2018-10-10 21:10:10 Stocks always drop when feds raise rates. Always. The fed needs to mellow out but they want to cash in on the good economy too ..
734 2018-10-10 21:10:10 "stocks are full of skeletons, SELL!"
735 2018-10-10 21:10:04 Clearly not enough cos you upped stocks and moved anyway 
736 2018-10-10 21:10:02 @JonathanHoenig @GaryKaltbaum Of course you’re going to see rising wages in an expanding economy as well as rising rates, rising energy costs & shrinking labor pools. I still remember relative prosperity w/a15% mortgage. Still, with stocks, price is everything. Hate the breadth.

739 2018-10-10 21:09:38 If the big indicies correct in a much more significant way (I am not convinced this will happen) I believe U stocks will generally hold their own initially. Shortly after I think money will pour into commodities like U3o8.

742 2018-10-10 21:09:14 It was mostly tech stocks— Google leading the pack. I think it’s a good thing having a good old tech shake up. They have way too much power.
743 2018-10-10 21:08:55 Down $1,500 last 5 days. Pulled out of a few. Pot stocks still doin their thing though.
744 2018-10-10 21:08:51 As long as Cannacord does not allow these companies to raise hundreds of millions (300M+) they should still create enough of a buzz for the stocks to run after the RTO.
745 2018-10-10 21:08:19 I feel like a genius. Told my financial advisor to sell off my unregistered stocks and put them in a high interest account a week and a half ago.  I could feel a market plunge coming....
746 2018-10-10 21:07:39 No trades in stocks today. Market has been choppy as hell over the last few days and I've still got some more of the @timothysykes @completepenny videos to watch. On the plus side, my forex account is up 18% today shorting the  choppy markets #OperationQTB
747 2018-10-10 21:07:32 with tech down so much,  what does someone do at this point with stocks still held through this sell off so far?

749 2018-10-10 21:06:45 Dow down 800+ points today.. Tech stocks had their worst day since 2011.

772 2018-10-10 21:03:27 Nobody should be panicking about Dow falling by 800+ points, have to look at the bigger picture, the pace at which stocks were rising wasn;t sustainable and needed correction, people are taking profits and markets will recovers. No emotions when it comes to the stock market.

779 2018-10-10 21:01:52 The Dow fell more than 800 points. I know that's worrisome for some people in the #StockMarket.

But honestly, a lot of folk need to stop fretting & clutching their pearls. Y'all aren't invested anyway. 

Only half of Americans own #stocks. Yet 80% of U.S. adults are in debt!

784 2018-10-10 21:01:13 Very true. But I do think back and can see how I could have held some stocks and made more money then I ever have and gone to the beach every day and not done anything. But hindsight is an easy thing. Some stocks went the other way too.
785 2018-10-10 21:01:07 Good time to buy some tech stocks. Thanks for the tip Adolfo

787 2018-10-10 21:01:01 Why would the Nafta deal cause you to bail out of tech stocks and the FAANGs?
788 2018-10-10 21:00:51 If you ever wanted to learn about investing, stocks, Gold, diamonds, financial literacy. Please reach out to my boy @JKonsulting it’s never to late to learn. I personally know him and I’ve watched him build his company this is somebody you want to know! Big things to come for him

790 2018-10-10 21:00:46 The Boeing Company (BA) price at close, 2018-10-10, is 367.47. #boeing #stocks #NYSE #space
791 2018-10-10 21:00:43 Tech stocks down like 10% over a couple of days and people run away. Black Friday has 40% discounts and people scream but buy buy and trample each other. Why aren’t they doing the same thing with stocks!?

793 2018-10-10 21:00:06 The Market goes through corrections and profit taking so really its not  that big a deal, as stocks drop, those looking to buy will and prices will rebound
794 2018-10-10 21:00:02 That Senator did nothing to stop the purchase of weapons of mass destruction or even common sense gun laws. He should share the fault in deaths by guns the he and the rest of the Republican Party have done nothing about. Bump stocks are a small part of the problem.
795 2018-10-10 20:59:45 All my stocks went down what a great way to start the day
796 2018-10-10 20:59:34 Stocks just plummeted Don. Be sure to tell them.
797 2018-10-10 20:59:16 Exactly. But, I would bet he and other members of his Organized Crime Family shorted stocks that are most affected by his ridiculous tariffs. He knew those stocks would down.Probably they made many millions.
798 2018-10-10 20:58:34 -Your stocks pay no dividends and you could have to wait 2 years for a return
799 2018-10-10 20:58:34 Stock markets are plummeting? Thought we were going to be winning so much we were going to get sick of it? Is this us sick of winning? Confused...has trump tweeted why he stopped making stocks go up yet?
800 2018-10-10 20:58:34 yes bigger traders selling tech stocks.
801 2018-10-10 20:58:20 Trump supporters been piling into stocks...
802 2018-10-10 20:58:16 We don’t need a “rerun” you melt. Countries that have held a 2nd referendum have become laughing stocks.

Face facts fellah. We’re leaving in March 2019. I cannot wait. Break out the bunting!   Oh, and of course one for yourself Mr Juncker!  
803 2018-10-10 20:58:15 Win Nov canola down A$4.67/t with drop in futures & lift in A$ vs C$. EU rape down A$0.55 with weaker A$ vs euro. US soybns under pressure despite bad harvest weather as the market assumes a lift to stocks in the USDA Report with a lift in yield & slow exports.
804 2018-10-10 20:57:48 If I could have got it don’t you think I would have? The phones are out of stocks and my phone was broke I had to pick something beloved
805 2018-10-10 20:57:48 Praise the Lord. Gold stocks, for ONCE, doing what gold stocks are supposed to do on a day like this.

S&P500 down 95 points. It's all you, Donald.  :)
806 2018-10-10 20:57:46 Does this mean stocks will being trading on fundamentals again or are we back to nothing matters in a few days?
807 2018-10-10 20:57:43 Ah!  I hadn't thought about that.  So the corporations bought back their stocks, only to have them drop in value... wow, great use of their big tax gift from Trump.
808 2018-10-10 20:57:34 Well Mike, if the Fed sticks to its hinted plans to keep going higher now, you & @FedDocumentary will get a real world demo: long bond will RALLY, stocks will crater, crude will collapse, $ will sink, banks w be impaled. And you'll still say rates were too low.
809 2018-10-10 20:57:34 News Alert: All DOW stocks in the RED!!!  832 points down!!! And it has NOTHING to do with Obama!!!  REPUBLICANS now own this economy. There’s no more faith in this government. It’s time to vote ALL these corrupt and conniving bastards out!!!

811 2018-10-10 20:56:50 I'm going to guess that tomorrow's auction for 30Y bonds is going to go quite well indeed. (lots of folks thinking "Maybe I should get going on that reallocation from stocks to bonds that our investment policy requires.")
812 2018-10-10 20:56:29 $TIF, $TWTR. $RL, $TPR, and $NFLX were the top five stocks that closed lower today.
813 2018-10-10 20:56:13 The nice thing about having risk mgmnt rules is that u watch the carnage from the bleachers because your stops have been triggered and there have been no other stocks that were compelling enough to buy. So it’s not about predicting the sell off, it’s about sticking to your plan.
814 2018-10-10 20:56:08 todays $VIX rally is a reaction of plunging $SPX which is a technical reaction of global stocks weakness, which is a reaction of strong $DXY and higher US rates, which is a reaction of hawkish FED and Tariffs war, which is a reaction of unfair trade deals in the first place. 
815 2018-10-10 20:55:43 Anyone hedging high tech stocks?
816 2018-10-10 20:55:40 Third worst day in history but it’s really no cause for concern. Tech stocks will be volatile at times, not necessarily this drastic, but they’ll rebound.
817 2018-10-10 20:55:32 $PRGO, $DLTR, $SJM, $GIS, $NEM are the top five stocks that closed higher today.
818 2018-10-10 20:55:26 Stocks are falling for the same reasons bonds are falling. The rally may be temporary.
819 2018-10-10 20:55:21 The stock sell off isn't really a sell off. It is because China is printing a lot of stocks and my tariff on them is making paper cost more. But don't worry, my policies will help us draw bigly better stocks.

TRUMP ON THE DOW DOWNTURN
#Trump #Resist
820 2018-10-10 20:55:17 This is one reason among many Trump didn't want interest rates to go up, but they did this to cool off the market.  It decreases capital lending and also shifts some money from stocks to fixed rate instruments.

Never worry about the U.S Indexes as long as USA remains capitalist
821 2018-10-10 20:55:08 Dow is already down another 170 point after hours.And stocks and bond sold off at the same time, very rare.
822 2018-10-10 20:55:02 What's a good buy level to start buying AMZN?  Really all the FANG stocks.
823 2018-10-10 20:54:54 Wow you mean the S&P and DOW dropping? Whoop-dee-do. Not even the lowest they have ever dropped to. Also stocks have been in a 10 year bull market and are having a correction just like crypto this summer. #noobs
824 2018-10-10 20:54:51 shotgun for hunting or home defense?I've seen them do quite well with an ar15,because they can customize it & no not bump stocks just in case you want to go there. But I'd rather see law abiding firearm owners prepared instead of being cleaned up in their homes. But again it's
825 2018-10-10 20:54:50 $AMD, $GE, $BAC, $MSFT, and $F were the top five most active stocks today.
826 2018-10-10 20:54:49 It's a special account you open where the government allows you a limit of x amount per year. Any interest you make is not taxed. You can use the account to invest In stocks and the gains you make aren't taxed! In canada its called a TFSA tax free saving account.
827 2018-10-10 20:54:17 Is it just me or are some momentum stocks starting to look TASTY! $ROKU $NVTA $SQ $TNDM $TTD $TWLO just waiting for them to bottom out...then POUNCE!
828 2018-10-10 20:54:06 Keep dropping, need to buy buy stocks lol. Good time to make money for future
829 2018-10-10 20:54:04 Luckily you can make money when stocks fall too 
830 2018-10-10 20:53:52 Need to invest in some stocks...
831 2018-10-10 20:53:49 At which price should all activists buy rwe stocks to gain on the rebound and thereby finance the fight against coal?
832 2018-10-10 20:53:46 @cvpayne how many Red Octobers have you been through? I think it's just Main St winning with SMB, SMB is growing with this growing economy, with the realization of overpriced Tech Stocks.  People just need to hold stocks
833 2018-10-10 20:53:45 Yo Donny Walnuts, you’ve contributed over a trillion to the debt ceiling and the stocks took a hard hit today- could be more in store. So much winning! Could you remember to talk about your wall, MS-13, Hillary, and your boy Kavanaugh who did nothing wrong? Pathetic! MAGA! Sad!
834 2018-10-10 20:53:44 I don’t even know why I bother to go to work when I could just trade stocks 
835 2018-10-10 20:53:41 Stock market? What's that? If it's an entire store full of stocks I can use to make a nice soup, folks, I'm there
836 2018-10-10 20:53:40 “Hey do you know anything about stocks?”
“What about dogs?”
837 2018-10-10 20:53:29 It’s not fair for you @CNN to fear-monger people who don’t understand stocks and bonds. This is a transition that happens when the market I s too good. Trimming the sail a bit as it were.
838 2018-10-10 20:53:26 Are stocks “on-sale” now? #AskingForAFriend @CNBC
839 2018-10-10 20:53:23 Time to buy some more stocks #StockMarket Gotta be in it to win it 
840 2018-10-10 20:53:01 @realDonaldTrump Hey Donnie I must say that all tbis winning is something. Gas prices through the roof, groceries and supplies more expensive, cars are more expensive, stocks are falling , jouralist killed. If this is winning I'd prefer the losing.
841 2018-10-10 20:52:53 Great fade!
842 2018-10-10 20:52:47 @realDonaldTrump Don’t see you tweeting how well stocks did today! I guess you’re too busy with your rally of paid people in attendance to care. If market keeps declining the truth will be out in spades, you are a LOSER and a FRAUD!
843 2018-10-10 20:52:46 Dear everyone with stocks: Stop panicking. The fundamental environment remains supportive of share appreciation. People are still using Amazon, Google, etc. #DontPanic #Nasdaq
844 2018-10-10 20:52:36 Great to be profitable on a rough day in the markets!!
845 2018-10-10 20:52:30 Yes, I booked a trip to New Zealand and invested the remainder into pot stocks.

847 2018-10-10 20:52:27 Brisbane paid a top 5 pick a 2nd rounder and one of their best young mids to get him. His stocks have only risen so Pies would need to sell the farm to meet Brisbanes needs.

850 2018-10-10 20:52:17 Look at the flip side. Blackout for US stocks buybacks started end of last week. When the earnings season is over those buybacks are gonna be cheap :)
851 2018-10-10 20:52:14 #TrumpSlump: Stocks suffer worst loss in eight months, as Dow plunges more than 800 points
852 2018-10-10 20:51:46 not sure I understand terminology - call me still newbie, but did buy a few more contracts @ 1.99 fill.  Know my risks; like the divvy stocks for when we turn, which we will
853 2018-10-10 20:51:45 Stocks can easily be in a bear market before the midterm election in Nov, and the economy in a worse recession than the one that followed the financial crisis of 2008 by the time the general election rolls around in 2020.   If so, the political ramifications are ominous!
854 2018-10-10 20:51:34 What part of buy low and sell high do investors not understand? #stocks #StockMarket
855 2018-10-10 20:51:34 He said that US stock market is rising while Chinese mkt tanked, but if you look at the individual stocks - most have fallen more than the Chinese ones.
856 2018-10-10 20:51:26 He said I’ve been bullish. I was bullish when trump got elected. I was bullish then there where here but... stocks are going to crash within a year. He was all over the place.
857 2018-10-10 20:51:19 Evening Market Wrap-up: stocks tumble in worst decline since Feb and longest decline since 2016.
858 2018-10-10 20:50:54 If we talk about long-term, I agree.
It's really late to invest in stocks now, their bull cycle obviously coming to the end. 
But I hope I can jump off in time.
It's small position anyway comparing to crypto.
859 2018-10-10 20:50:35 Not when you’re in OTC stocks.
860 2018-10-10 20:50:30 Win Nov canola down A$4.67/t with drop in futures & lift in A$ vs C$. EU rape down A$0.55 with weaker A$ vs euro. US soybns under pressure despite bad harvest weather as the market assumes a lift to stocks in the USDA Report with a lift in yield & slow exports.
861 2018-10-10 20:50:28 It’s buy buy buy. Tech stocks
862 2018-10-10 20:50:16 The winter has always proven to be good to crypto..... With the stocks on fire and that news..... ( Wow ) getting ready
863 2018-10-10 20:50:12 “Why can’t we just print money and buy stocks?”
864 2018-10-10 20:50:08 Now we know much of a person's wealth is on paper, Stocks, bonds etc...  We also know Trump has hotels, resorts all across the world, case in point Trump Towers.  Sorry if you have a problem with that, I don't.
865 2018-10-10 20:49:51 My stocks ate it today what happened who fucked up?
866 2018-10-10 20:49:50 October has been terrible for stocks. Didnt lose any money, but lost a lot of profit. Sold everything off until things appear to be moving in the right direction
867 2018-10-10 20:49:27 If you bought the dip in energy stocks this is hate speech! ;)
868 2018-10-10 20:48:46 Has anyone looked at the stocks recently?
869 2018-10-10 20:48:43 Time will tell..... I am not in stocks, so please dont trade on my sentiment.... I just think this is going to escalate. ( hoping at least )
870 2018-10-10 20:48:43 Why do you idiots believe this charlatan . Dude is so full of shit . Tell me as he posted one peep in the last few days on BOX or TWTR which were his stocks of the year
871 2018-10-10 20:48:34 October has been terrible for stocks :/
872 2018-10-10 20:48:29 Important for people to notice that bonds are selling off WITH stocks. The market knows that in the next crisis, there will be nowhere to hide.
873 2018-10-10 20:48:03 A good time to buy the means of production. Or if you're a redditor it is a great time to sell your stocks, panic, and wait for the next opportunity to buy high and sell low.
874 2018-10-10 20:47:56 My days off I’m up at night sleeping during the day. Besides rn. I’m trying to cash out these stocks lol
875 2018-10-10 20:47:38 I am trying to find out the trigger for this but some concerns on interest rates but on tech stocks ? which as I work in the market in the UK is buoyant as it has been for a while
876 2018-10-10 20:47:33 So storm Callum hits tomorrow, I’m now going around like a headless chicken checking stocks of batteries, I’ve the battery packs charging, phone and tablets are next. Back up gas canister for the portable camping stove has been checked and working. Bread, milk and teabags sorted.
877 2018-10-10 20:47:29 I can see more than 15 % correction in #stocks by Friday 12/10/2018. And more than 25 % correction by 31/12/2018.
878 2018-10-10 20:47:19 Stocks crumble. Remember the Fed will raise rates until they break something.
879 2018-10-10 20:47:01 Well magats the stocks today are just a hint of what's to come in the near furure thanks to your fearless cult leader. Remember this he already gave any bailout money away to his rich friends in the tax scam..remember?.
880 2018-10-10 20:46:57 Good data highlighting that low vol #etfs protect SOME of downside but if nearly all stocks in $SPY decline then $splv $usmv will too.
881 2018-10-10 20:46:51 Should tech stocks even be allowed to be traded ? They don’t produce a tangible product that is needed .
882 2018-10-10 20:46:36 Agreed but there are some small cap stocks in this environment where you are unable to hit a bid all day long. I agree with having a plan but executing it can be tricky in thin markets.
883 2018-10-10 20:46:36 Basically all the companies with rubbish cash flows and negative income are getting punished.. growth stocks getting hammered, value stocks holding... if short lived -> defensive play, if broad based -> start of a deeper sell off
884 2018-10-10 20:46:31 The dow dropped 832 the worst since June 2016 but just the other day trump was saying how good stocks were hmmmm the worst because of the tariff wars hmmmm
885 2018-10-10 20:46:22 I cant wait to ask all those fuckers that asked me how $btc was doing, how there stocks are doing lol. Just need a few more days in the red for them to get real nervous
886 2018-10-10 20:46:15 Gold played it cool today.. not one worry about stocks and bonds crashing.
887 2018-10-10 20:46:03 alot of these American stocks are way over valued and above their valuation #FAANMG
888 2018-10-10 20:46:02 wrong with crypto, wrong with stocks. disappointed
889 2018-10-10 20:45:39 If fiat's dead.   Stocks are dead.   End of days.

895 2018-10-10 20:44:32 Stocks Plunge as Tech Investors Worry About China and Rising Bond Yields Bite - New York Times
896 2018-10-10 20:44:23 The market has been artificially inflated. Those buy back stocks from the Trump trillion dollar tax cut made everything appear great. Now there is no buy backs, inflation from overheated market. The correction is long over due. This is only the beginning.
897 2018-10-10 20:44:13 like dan niles says here on cbnc THIS IS A FULL BLOWN PANIC   ...yup u think stocks are falling in 10 points increments  most stocks would have closed at ZERO if the market stayed open another hour or so...

902 2018-10-10 20:43:50 Maybe sooner than you think. Actually Libor rate stop rising since September 27. This might be first sign for Fed, tightening cycle is over. If they reverse course stocks fall downhill with $$$. Btw tomorrow might be margin call.
903 2018-10-10 20:43:30 Buy the dips ...

"U.S. stocks plunge most since February; the Dow sank over 800 points and the Nasdaq fell more than 4%"
904 2018-10-10 20:43:17 Too late, stocks are going south,
905 2018-10-10 20:43:12 Just got the market advisory from BA/Merrill Lynch.  It contains the following statement:  "We look at other scenarios and believe a Democratic sweep would be the most bearish scenario for stocks, especially in a landslide."   That's bad. Vote GOP.
906 2018-10-10 20:43:11 Stocks would be up if it was you in charge of the fed ;)
907 2018-10-10 20:42:57 Dems are actually cheering the DOW is down?? Newsflash you idiots: Hard-working American retirements are in stocks! You really don't care about Americans, do you???
908 2018-10-10 20:42:56 tech stocks was atrocious today jesus
909 2018-10-10 20:42:53 I want everyone to own stocks. Even a single stock is a vote and that gives you power to change how a company operates. Of course there are other players in the game, but can you imagine the change tech would see if privacy activists bought single stocks and began voting en mass?
910 2018-10-10 20:42:48 Did any of these give reasons to get out of tech stocks specifically today?
911 2018-10-10 20:42:28 Housing market & stock bubbles are massively overvalued...due to zirp and nirp....bond market  bloodbath ...."when rates are low, stocks/houses will grow..,when rates are high, stocks/housing will die"  ..wait til 30 yr mortgage rates are 8,9 10%+ nothing to do with any President
912 2018-10-10 20:42:27 Interest rate hike - T-bills are going up so institutional investors are taking $$$ out of stocks and moving to bonds.
913 2018-10-10 20:42:22 People are all excited about American stocks being down to same value as 7 weeks ago (or whatever). Isn't that weird In such a short time frame practically no one will have had time to buy anything.
914 2018-10-10 20:42:22 Damn stocks are falling hard and crypto is stable what an odd reality lol

917 2018-10-10 20:41:44 My retail stocks monitor is a sea of red today amid the broader market selloff, with one big exception: 

$JCP finishes the day up nearly 7%, likely because investors expect it could grab some market share in a Sears bankruptcy.
918 2018-10-10 20:41:30 Great day for following the trend  , hope everybody made out okay! Market crashes, and my small caps stay protectes I love it!!

924 2018-10-10 20:40:47 @FoxNews and @WSJ headline tomorrow: Democrats in trouble as stocks slide and voters grow increasingly anxious about economy and blame the democrats for disrupting the WH, senate and congress majority GOP plans of economic growth
925 2018-10-10 20:40:39 Selling Begets Selling
Yields rise and stocks slide. 
-Economic growth concerns manifested in cyclical sectors weakness.
-U.S. Treasury yields push back towards multi-year highs, contributing to the widespread sell-off.

926 2018-10-10 20:40:33 Trade war intensified and stocks drop! Tariffs aren’t good for stocks or for the country! History teaches Tariffs result in depressions or wars....neither acceptable! Someone please give a history lesson to Trump....it’s as tho he’s never read history at all....
927 2018-10-10 20:40:14 RT @NPR: Stocks saw their largest drop since April on Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 800 points, about 3.1 percent. The S&P 500 fell by a similar percentage, and @NASDAQ dropped 4 percent. Netflix, Amazon and Google parent Alphabet were all off sharply.
928 2018-10-10 20:40:05 Easy, there - remember the 1st Rule of News: If Joe Scarborough says it, it's probably crap.

The decline is pretty broad-based, & this is a traditional time of year for stocks to fall like leaves. A fraction of this year's gains, it could be a buying opportunity
929 2018-10-10 20:40:00 The Dow plunged 800+ points today. Seems to be the third-worst point decline in history... what are you going to do about this @realDonaldTrump ? This happens under your watch @POTUS #DowJones #Stocks #Money
930 2018-10-10 20:39:56 Absolutely brutal. Square stocks lost 30% of their value this week and looks like theres no end in sight. More red tomorrow likely
931 2018-10-10 20:39:40 Bad day to own stocks! Let’s hope that don’t stick around
932 2018-10-10 20:39:40 I’m chilled I have a diversified pf alts - stocks, blockchain gold, copper, tungsten etc 
933 2018-10-10 20:39:16 Hope you don't depend on the money you have invested in stocks!
934 2018-10-10 20:39:11 Why would anyone buy stocks in today's political climate? 

You can't just slap someone's head and wrists into a mechanism, lock it down, and leave them in the town square, expecting them to learn from their mistakes and respect you.

Not anymore.
935 2018-10-10 20:39:06 How much did stocks plunge on fear of climate collapse, described in the IPCC report (and elsewhere)? Is this not even registering?
936 2018-10-10 20:39:04 Tech stocks market will implode. Mark these words.
937 2018-10-10 20:38:51 Best Stocks to Buy After the Correction: 
1. $amzn 
2. $fb 
3. $tsla
4. $shop
5. $nflx 

If you buy at market open tomorrow & hold for a month or two, you could easily see 15% growth.
938 2018-10-10 20:38:49 I just checked some stocks ouch
939 2018-10-10 20:38:41 US tech stocks see their worst day since August 2011. Nasdaq Composite down 315.97 points (-4.08%) and the Dow closes down 831 points -(3.15%). #markets @i24NEWS_EN
940 2018-10-10 20:38:31 Many working folks pensions are invested in stocks.
941 2018-10-10 20:38:13 Looking forward to scanning charts later to see what’s holding up. There must be some stocks not getting sold??
942 2018-10-10 20:38:03 *Advent Packs*

We'll be announcing our advent packs via email this week. Make sure you're signed up to be the first to know. Stocks are limited.
943 2018-10-10 20:37:53 Square woke up this morning at $86.17

It's now at $70.70

That's what happens when your CFO leaves on the worst day for tech stocks in over 7 years.
944 2018-10-10 20:37:51 Trudeau is a right-winger, stop pretending he's not. And who gives a shit about the stock market? Majority of people do not have investments in stocks.
945 2018-10-10 20:37:47 #stocks #markets move up and down. #TSX and #Dow slide, and #Treasury #yields fall.... Does any of this really matter? Perhaps for the short term #investor or a retiree. If you have time horizon, and a long term strategy, focus on that!
946 2018-10-10 20:37:39 I’m no short seller.  I am the owner of the company from whom the CEA CAR T IP was stolen.  We are litigating.  I don’t buy or sell stocks at all to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest.  $SRNE
947 2018-10-10 20:37:37 #btc #bitcoin performed quite well compared to tech stocks today. Is this an indicator #bitcoin is a store of value?
948 2018-10-10 20:37:33 Because the Yankees lost the Dow fell more than 800 points, with tech stocks hit hardest. Some investors wonder if the market can recover...
949 2018-10-10 20:37:31 Bottom-callers take a lot of knives to the chest until the bottom is actually in. Wait for the trend to turn and for your stocks to set up where you want them to be.
950 2018-10-10 20:37:29 MARKETS:  Sell-off in tech stocks today as Dow drops over 800 pts. Worries over rising interest rates and tension over trade.
951 2018-10-10 20:37:23 Just wait until the Mueller report comes out and Trump and his immediate family are indicted. Let's just say an 800 point drop in stocks will look like the warm-up act.
952 2018-10-10 20:37:20 “Stocks suffer worst loss in 8 months.” “Dow plunges 600 points.” @realDonaldTrump tell me again how you are making the economy better?
953 2018-10-10 20:37:13 He'll pressure Fed to buy stocks to prop up prices....can't let his buddies lose money...better to let the tax papyer take the hit, again...
954 2018-10-10 20:37:12 Of course I can.  But it periods of chaos, while correlations do break down, those with a "supposed" negative correlation should outperform.   For example, 2s outperforming stocks.   Gold outperforming stocks.
955 2018-10-10 20:37:01 As for bump stocks that remains to be seen. But they were defined as protected arms under the PLCAA by the court that dismissed the lawsuit against the manufacturer.
956 2018-10-10 20:36:51 Tech companies bro. Like Google and Facebook that have become tyrannical 1984 gestapo thought police. Wouldn't wanna hold those stocks when Trump busts up those monopoly men with Anti-Trust. US economy is booming big tech however has cancer(neo-liberalism) and needs an operation.
957 2018-10-10 20:36:42 There is a general relief that stocks are now a little more reasonably priced
958 2018-10-10 20:36:39 We are in for a horror movie in the Divided States.

Stocks pointing at higher inflation heart beat be4 recession heart attack.

Hatred at an all time high with racial, ethnic divisions.

We as a nation are ready to burst.
959 2018-10-10 20:36:38 Fly Folks: We need to replace an aging fly incubator for our backup stocks. Nothing fancy- just maintain 18C (and sometimes 25C) and last >5 years hassle free. Size: standard fridge size (~20 cubic feet).  Recommendations?

976 2018-10-10 20:34:41 Damn stocks are getting crushed right now. Time to buy
977 2018-10-10 20:34:20 The tax cuts allowed the corps to buy back their stocks, which is creating a tighter control with less accountability to the broader public. It also keeps the money in the hands of the very wealthy.

979 2018-10-10 20:34:08 Probably just Putin selling his Facebook stocks.

987 2018-10-10 20:33:10 Another way to describe the market sell-off today is that top stocks are back to the price they were at in mid-August. You won't see much of that description because it don't sell papers. Or whatever we sell these days: pixels, bits, web ads.
988 2018-10-10 20:33:09 They should be held in stocks for a weekend and people allowed to throw hummus at them but only if it's past it's sell by date

993 2018-10-10 20:32:31 CNN: "Stocks fell 800 points today. Investors wonder if the Bull market will finally be coming to an end." Finnaly coming to an end, they want it to, success may finally over in their mind. They really want the county to do poorly so dems can capitalize.
994 2018-10-10 20:32:28 Yes, I do know. That’s why civilians don’t need semi-automatics or bump stocks
995 2018-10-10 20:32:19 Great day to be buying tech stocks for Christmas gifts! Bargain-basement prices.
996 2018-10-10 20:32:09 Lol... right?! 

Funny thing is... the numbers could even show it's a fact that the #Crypto market gets stronger in relation to the stock market decline--- and most people will still say so what- I'm sticking w/ traditional #stocks 
997 2018-10-10 20:32:06 No worries it will bounce back. Tech is always messing with stocks they were just covering it with Obamaites dirty deals! Not any more; we see the Players and we know who is Playing America!
998 2018-10-10 20:31:57 People stress the fed rate hike, sell out stocks. I just come in and swoop em on the low.  Creates a great tech market buy too. BUY BUY BUY. #stackincheese
999 2018-10-10 20:31:47 Thank god I liquidated all my stocks a little bit ago but holy shit lol only thing I got left is twitter and it’s having it’s way with me to say the least
1000 2018-10-10 20:31:43 Much needed selloff but nowhere near true valuations. If bonds pick up tomorrow, so will stocks. Make few bucks
1001 2018-10-10 20:31:30 great call, except you have been buying international stocks non stop.  you have gotten killed and to be honest, you are kind of a fraud
1002 2018-10-10 20:31:18 Big falls on Wall Street as US China trade tensions simmer, and IMF downgrades global growth, Tech stocks hit as investors trim risk. Dow Jones ends down 3%, Nasdaq dives 4% @abcnews #ausbiz #auspol
1003 2018-10-10 20:31:17 The stock market was dragged down by a sell-off in tech stocks, rising interest rates and tension over trade disputes with China.  ABC NEWS

1007 2018-10-10 20:31:00 my stocks gain today was -2.53%. curious to find out what event caused the instability because regardless of how the market is doing, im still going to remind people that the POTUS has little to no control of the economy.

1009 2018-10-10 20:30:53 sure, I can remember these days... but don't we all think that we choose (biotech) stocks so wisely that "ours" will not go down as much when the market sinks? at least today not true for me 
1010 2018-10-10 20:30:50 I'd like to thank all finance services for constantly pinging me that tech stocks are down a ton today

1014 2018-10-10 20:30:19 1. Analysis of 3 major indexes. Above/below 8/21/50 day moving averages?

2. Analysis of industry groups and specific sectors. 30% - 40% of a stock price movement is related to groups and sectors.
Focus on stocks in the Top 10 - 20 out of 197 industry groups
1015 2018-10-10 20:30:17 U.S. stocks have dictated overnight market moves with all indices down over 3% and testing key support levels. The USD is weaker against most G10 apart from the commodity bloc currencies with CAD and AUD the worst performers, weaker on all the crosses.
1016 2018-10-10 20:30:10 3. Fundamental/technical characteristics of stocks in these leading groups:
a. Over $8.00
b. Price above 8/21/50 day moving averages.
c. Price within 15% of 52-week highs.
1017 2018-10-10 20:30:04 10.10: What is a midday bid? It’s a massive buying program that begins around 1-2 EST and lasts to the close that moves stocks over 2%+. Until I see several of those over a period of a few weeks, I expect the rout to continue... #StockMarket
1018 2018-10-10 20:30:03 Weekly crude oil stocks up next
1019 2018-10-10 20:30:01 d. Look for "franchise leaders" in their field. i.e. Amazon, Facebook, Google, Netflix
e. Prefer stocks with EITHER last quarters earnings or sales greater than 40%.
f. Prefer stocks with positive annual earnings estimates.

1026 2018-10-10 20:29:23 Well having puts on 5 tech stocks today was a good call.
1027 2018-10-10 20:29:11 Tec stocks are dropping. NASDAQ is at 3 month low if you're into buying
1028 2018-10-10 20:29:03 Make sure you talk about how the stocks dropped more than 3% today.  DJIA dropped 831 points!  This is on YOU buddy.
1029 2018-10-10 20:29:01 6. Never invest more than 15% - 20% of capital in any issue.
7. Take partial profits as stock advances. (10% - 20% of amount invested)
8. Raise stops as stocks advance in price. Use trailing stops. Price should remain above 8/21 day moving average.
1030 2018-10-10 20:29:00 Tech stocks mostly. Amazon, FB, etc. Could be the start of a Bear market-not good
1031 2018-10-10 20:28:52 So the US stocks have crashed big.. Waiting tomorrow for the Indian stock market viz the BSE & NSE, Nifty to follow the trend as well.
1032 2018-10-10 20:28:50 #GeorgeSoros paid me to dump my stocks. Pass it on!
1033 2018-10-10 20:28:42 FX Summary: U.S. stocks have dictated overnight market moves with all indices down over 3% and testing key support levels. The USD is weaker against most G10 apart from the commodity bloc currencies with CAD and AUD the worst performers, weaker on all the crosses.
1034 2018-10-10 20:28:37 9. Never let a 20% profit turn into a loss.

10.NEVER take an initial position before an earnings release.

11.Overall, avoid most biotechnology stocks due to "news event" risks.
1035 2018-10-10 20:28:36 So are you going to take responsibility for today’s Dow drop or are you only responsible for when stocks are up? 

#unaccountable
1036 2018-10-10 20:28:26 Yes, funds are nothing more than compilation of stocks. The market overall drop would also affect funds (and stocks within those funds)
1037 2018-10-10 20:28:25 We life in a world where is #bitcoin  more stable then #stocks markets
#bullishonlife
1038 2018-10-10 20:27:59 CNBC headline: tech stocks have worst day since August 2011. Translation: nasdaq, which is now at 7,400 had the worst day since it was at 2,300...
1039 2018-10-10 20:27:30 Tech stocks leading the market drop. Hmmmm wonder why?
1040 2018-10-10 20:27:21 (2018) if the nasdaq can't float, then the workers/dow arent using it -- that's when you should worry. Some people save money, some govts ruin it w inflation, some stocks are just sh'coins outright. If your board isn't thirsty, the sharks will know. #internetage #NWO
1041 2018-10-10 20:27:16 The simplest explanation for the stock decline is that stocks (especially tech stocks) were overvalued and people are freaking a bit about rising interest rates. An overdue market response.
1042 2018-10-10 20:27:14 Artificially Infatuated stocks can't stay high very long... eventually the bubble bursts
1043 2018-10-10 20:27:13 Yeah... it's not like we could almost instantly average every single stock price in the world within a matter of miliseconds.  We need to know about how well US Steel and Standard oil and IBM are doing.  

(Yeah it's not those stocks anymore but you get the point.)
1044 2018-10-10 20:27:09 Stocks? What a God awful day. Will hopefully be a hell of a recovery, as long it's before my expirations. Great day to load up!!!
1045 2018-10-10 20:27:09 As much as today's market performance is painful short term, it’s actually really healthy long term wise. Upon his reset in momentum stocks, look for company shares to rise again into the end of the year.
1046 2018-10-10 20:27:00 To all my GOP friends out there.. please show all of us how much you support Trump and his policies by holding onto your stocks and do not sell them... if you do sell you are admitting that Trump has failed!!!! So please teach us a lesson... I sold about 3 months ago BTW...

The big boys were just looking for an excuse to take profits in tech stocks.  Michael gave them cover to all sell together.  Also automated trading probably caused 500 points of this.
1048 2018-10-10 20:26:50 What I love about days like this -4% is that it makes a lot of people pooh in their pants and run away... thats the time to load up $SPX and stocks - get the weak hands out and let the strong one buy cheap , not worried at all for $SPX here - only #DAX going lower still imo
1049 2018-10-10 20:26:42 $BABA 120 $SQ 48.50 $AAPL 198.60 $DIA 248.75 give me those prices then Im interested in holding stocks again.  Maybe
1050 2018-10-10 20:26:42 Little tip: when the market goes down, stocks are on sale.
1051 2018-10-10 20:26:00 Aren't the guns that the bump stocks used on, already banned in Chicago/cool county? Pretty sure they are.
1052 2018-10-10 20:26:00 I know we're not really doing this "buying stocks" thing today, but I did initiate a position in $BERY
1053 2018-10-10 20:25:26 Meanwhile MJ stocks continue their surge...
1054 2018-10-10 20:25:23 Interests rates aren't up that much; trade wars are going well for U.S., so why the big drop in the stock market?  Is this a 'get-even' tactic re Kavanaugh's confirmation. Liberal billionaires ( Soros)  can sell off stocks and take losses to scare voters right before mid-terms.
1055 2018-10-10 20:25:19 on one hand, i don't want the market dropping, but on the other the drop is due in part to uncertainty about tech stocks -- and tech companies are evil, so..
1056 2018-10-10 20:25:19 US stocks drop over 831 points led by big tech companies
1057 2018-10-10 20:25:16 Evidently Stocks have been Trumpsized.
1058 2018-10-10 20:25:06 @cvpayne Where to from here.  Technicals pointing toward  down Q4 in stocks.

How far down is anyone's guess
1059 2018-10-10 20:25:01 The big boys were just looking for an excuse to take profits in tech stocks.  Michael gave them cover to all sell together.  Also automated trading probably caused 500 points of this.
1060 2018-10-10 20:24:59 WHY DIDNT ANYONE WARN ME TO SELL MY STOCKS YESTERDAY?
1061 2018-10-10 20:24:54 Not really recommend but I use ameritrade.. bought pot stocks last year and just sold a few weeks ago at ATH...  I dont try to day trade cuz the fees.. but I use it for long term stuff... im looking at 3d printing companies now...
1062 2018-10-10 20:24:44 "#Stocks are a leading #indicator of social mood. This is why stocks will crash first, seemingly with no reason and the "bad" events and "bad" #news will appear later."
1063 2018-10-10 20:24:44 I’m happy tech stocks going down!
1064 2018-10-10 20:24:33 @FZucchi I'm getting them paranoid thoughts "any more down F stocks and all the bullsh*t talk". Bottom should be soon, I guess.. lol
1065 2018-10-10 20:24:31 So let’s see it’s not President Trumps economy until we get a hiccup. I checked my stocks they are up today. Thank you President Trump
1066 2018-10-10 20:24:27 These sad & bitter fruitloops appear during soft markets, only time they appear smart. Where are they when our stocks are multibagging? Retired at 35 in '10 after 10 years of winners even with GFC fallout. Never have to work again. Do people want to follow a winner or loser?
1067 2018-10-10 20:24:25 Its called profit-taking. When the stocks rise high enough, you sell and take your money and buy in at a lower rate (you hope).
1068 2018-10-10 20:24:23 This big dn day in stocks reminds me of a question I get from traders who are used to up mkts and strategies asking, "What do I do now?" My answer, "A trading strategy should handle up, down AND sideways markets. This is down. Should already know what to do! Execute and  ETR!
1069 2018-10-10 20:24:17 Everyone of the 50 largest stocks on the U.S. market were down today, many by 3% to 6%. Netflix was down over 8% and Amazon by 6%.
1070 2018-10-10 20:24:15 Stocks down over 800 points today. Interest rates up for home mortgages. Let’s see if @realDonaldTrump will accept responsibility for it as he has done in last year with any rises in stocks. You don’t get to take credit for great stock market yet ignore losses due to tariffs.
1071 2018-10-10 20:24:14 If you look at these trends, most of the economic growth going on right now is actually the sale of tech stocks & the purchase of construction, mining, oil, gas, etc stocks. We are ungoing an economic realignment as the "startup economy" has proven to produce zero value or assets
1072 2018-10-10 20:24:11 how much do you think stocks will go down tomorrow?
1073 2018-10-10 20:24:08 The market took a nice enema today #StockMarket Several Weed stocks were the exception
1074 2018-10-10 20:24:02 Stocks plunged today ! MAGMA or SWAMPY?
1075 2018-10-10 20:23:57 @NYCPunter I’ve enjoyed many of your posts and tips on golf and stocks but today was enjoyable because my position in #TLRY was as my gimme putt for triple bogey....whip cream on shit lol.
1076 2018-10-10 20:23:54 Nice! But Treasury bond yields are blowing out! That's great for my 401(k), as I shorted the entire market via my retirement fund after Nov. 2016.

Stocks or bonds. When push comes to shove, the Elite will always choose the latter. The dumb $ is in stocks. Always has been.
1077 2018-10-10 20:23:54 Many working class people have stocks in 401Ks, and those are the people who will be most affected. The rich have protections and loopholes. The middle class does not.
1078 2018-10-10 20:23:23 Ok guys the DOW about too do a a strong reversal off the 200 MA so will stocks best time too get The Hottest Top 10 Daily Stock Picks List
1079 2018-10-10 20:23:13 Well Trump is only responsible when it goes up. 
When stocks drop, blame Hillary, Obama, DEMS
1080 2018-10-10 20:22:57 ill be interested again when my favorite 10 US companies ..stocks ..yield better than 4% again 

this ain t that
1081 2018-10-10 20:22:55 Thats why I'm not currently playing with it at all, although MJ stocks have been quite enticing in the last few weeks
1082 2018-10-10 20:22:42 World stocks ex Asia fall hard: US -3.3%; Europe -1.6%. The "chickens" came home to roost as investors fled the markets due to the quadruple threat pf rising interest-rates, a weakening world GDP forecast, trade issues & an expensive market. For long-term investors - it will pass
1083 2018-10-10 20:22:36 When will Algo's actually "get smart" and buy some stocks while selling other in the same day.  Humans used to do this all the time.  ;)))
1084 2018-10-10 20:22:25 Stocks are doing bad for over a week Is there anything you want to said
1085 2018-10-10 20:22:18 I do not think sell off is unwarranted, S&P500 could be valued anywhere from 2500-3000 w current earnings estimates and 10-year bond rates in the low to mid 3’s. I will say this is the first selloff in 10 years that I thus far do not believe is buyable yet. #stocks #bonds
1086 2018-10-10 20:22:17 Lets move to the stocks. At least they have some real volatility. 

#Crypto #stocks #dump
1087 2018-10-10 20:22:16 Funniest thing about today was I had 2 of my hippie friends ping me about which brokerage house to use. They want to buy pot stocks!
1088 2018-10-10 20:22:10 Alright market sell off.. how are you handling it?

#stocks #investing #bull #bear $AMZN $SQ $TSLA $FB $TWTR $MU $MSFT $NFLX $UVXY $TVIX
1089 2018-10-10 20:22:08 Agreed. That’s why I stick to my dividend earning stocks.
My swan portfolio... Sleep Well At Night.
1090 2018-10-10 20:22:07 Everytime people talk about stocks and investments or whatever my brain just shuts off.
1091 2018-10-10 20:21:54 So what did #Trump do to tank the stocks this time?
1092 2018-10-10 20:21:48 This censorship is taking it's toll on big tech stocks. With interest rates on the rise & the near certainty of government regulations/intervention for the ongoing censorship, Susan, Mark & Jack have bigger problems coming soon! Enjoy the show!
1093 2018-10-10 20:21:47 Dow down more than 800 points. #Stocks, is bear around the corner?
1094 2018-10-10 20:21:42 Hardly the reason, it was driven by majority of tech stocks, this will make a fast turn around as investors will buy “low”, of course “murdering joe” won’t bother to post that, only the negative spin!
1095 2018-10-10 20:21:40 Itll all come good for U stocks great buying op
1096 2018-10-10 20:21:26 If you make as much as you claim, you would not be wishing for a bad stock market day because, of course, you'd be invested in stocks, right smarty-pants?  Or do they not offer 401k when you collect your welfare?
1097 2018-10-10 20:21:21 I knew the stocks would fall. One day it will hit rock bottom and never recover. It's coming.
1098 2018-10-10 20:21:21  not a good look for the stocks today wtf 
1099 2018-10-10 20:21:17 In a liquidity crunch would you sell your favorite stock or your child lol? 
#uranium #stocks #corrections
1100 2018-10-10 20:21:12 If you change the sell button to stocks I would press both, got 2 hands 
1101 2018-10-10 20:20:57 So, the cannabis stocks that are supposedly in a bubble were a great hedge today. 
1102 2018-10-10 20:20:54 Dans la limite des stocks disponibles ! 
1103 2018-10-10 20:20:44 So our guy over there warned his friends to sell Steinhoff stocks. Is that scandalous or just some patriotism
1104 2018-10-10 20:20:42 $tsla actually performed stronger than #faang stocks today which is hilarious. Really happy about that tbh.
1105 2018-10-10 20:20:34 I should take out stocks in boneless buffalo wings considering how often Noah and I eat them 
1106 2018-10-10 20:20:21 I hope Rangers know something we don't because all these court cases is costing us money,I knew it was coming I've always thought we've went into a deal   with JD sports 2 soon & that's why he won the last court case & why the stocks of kits are getting drip fed to the fans imo
1107 2018-10-10 20:20:19 Stocks will bounce a lil bit in the weeks ahead. But it’ll be followed by another sell off. Buy Bitcoin lol
1108 2018-10-10 20:19:49 In all honesty the Health Of rhe Dow doesn’t effect most of us - we are all too poor to have stocks
1109 2018-10-10 20:19:46 @RudyJay760 spitting facts right now. Weather gotta be perfect, stocks gotta be up  I don't have time to wait for his development the next 3 years. Ask him to throw a back shoulder fade... Gonna be the same in 3 years.
1110 2018-10-10 20:19:44 Donate money to People's Currency Foundation. Donate shares of stocks and ETFs if possible too. They can pay dividends and can effectively fund PCF indefinitely potentially. @peoplescurrency @MannaCurrency
1111 2018-10-10 20:19:36 Not to say mine don’t! I lost 112.00 dollars today. I’m mad. 

The weed stocks made money. 

I’m over it.
1112 2018-10-10 20:19:33 U.S. stocks just tumbled the most since February. The selloff took S&P 500 to the lowest in 3 months, the Dow plunged over 800 points and the Nasdaq fell more than 4%. Computer companies led the S&P 500 to a 5th straight loss, longest slide since Donald Trump’s U.S. election win.
1113 2018-10-10 20:19:30 What if all the stock is already owned by all the whales and the only stock owned by individuals are held in retirement funds and don't know how to sell? What if the elite's plan was to get people to mindlessly buy stocks with each paycheck?What if stock was only worthless paper?
1114 2018-10-10 20:19:29 How soon is the tricky part. Your portfolio should include equity stocks but ammo and food rations. Maybe a bunker instead a vacation home.
1115 2018-10-10 20:19:25 Do stocks bounce tomorrow?

1118 2018-10-10 20:19:16 Stocks keep sliding: Dow falls 800 points - CNN Businesshttps://apple.news/AhqlS1tgGQmuD7mxi1eNt7g.
1119 2018-10-10 20:19:14 Anytime stocks lower, anytime an American company lays off many due to losing a billion dollars due to anyone, in this case Trump's Tariffs, that is not a sign of a booming economy.
1120 2018-10-10 20:19:14 @realDonaldTrump what do you have to say about the more than 800 point drop in stocks today?  Nice results from your feud with China .. you suck
1121 2018-10-10 20:19:09 Investing is quite simple. Buy quality stocks that have a history of a steadily increasing dividend payment of 10 years or more with a conservative P/E, & add to those positions on pullbacks. If you listen to pundits & buy companies with unrealistic P/E's, you will not rest easy
1122 2018-10-10 20:18:54 Stocks are crashing. Time to make a call and then take a well deserved nap 
1123 2018-10-10 20:18:53 Si tu veux je peux te ramener des petits trucs pour remplir tes stocks
1124 2018-10-10 20:18:51 The DOW fell more than 800 points today.  The biggest fall since February with tech stocks taking the biggest hit. @realDonaldTrump @federalreserve
1125 2018-10-10 20:18:46 It is being totted up to investors shying away from rocketing tech stocks, and I'm sure that's true. But since #POTUS45 brags on it all the time, let's note that today 'his' Dow closed down 800+ points.
1126 2018-10-10 20:18:46 NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks suffer worst loss in 8 months as rising interest rates pull investors out of the market; tech stocks hit hardest.
1127 2018-10-10 20:18:37 Remember the days when Bitcoin were more volatile than stocks ? #DownJones
1128 2018-10-10 20:18:36 U.S. stocks tumbled the most since February. The selloff led the S&P to its fifth straight loss, the Dow sank over 800 points and the Nasdaq plunged 4% -- Bloomberg
1129 2018-10-10 20:18:26 Stocks Drop Sharply: Dow falls 800 points
1130 2018-10-10 20:18:17 -800 pts wow. Over reacted over sold. This makes ER that much more interesting. Back from break and scooped up some of that value. Just gonna sit through this #spookfest.

Hey Trumpy, you like to take credit for a soaring stock market. Why won't you comment on stocks plunging today. I betcha Rally Trump doesn't mention it and his supporters are to gullable to get it.
1132 2018-10-10 20:18:10 And in my opinion, the damage has been done. Nothing is going to save us from this crash. The record  high stock is like a doomsday clock, pointing to what is to come. Inflation of stocks, has always been shown to show a spike in heart beat of the economy be4 the heart attack
1133 2018-10-10 20:17:55 What do you think about Ron Paul comment on stocks going down 50%? Is it possible or probable. Thank you !
1134 2018-10-10 20:17:40 Second day that I can invest in stocks and Dow plummets 800 points :)))))

1137 2018-10-10 20:17:24 In other words: 'Screw the health of everyone in Europe, we will continue diesel-poisoning everyone, because we want to keep our freaking dividends on $VW and $BMW stocks.' Germany and Visegrad, really??
1138 2018-10-10 20:17:20 So the stocks plummeted today by 800 points. Is tRump going to blame that on the Democrats too?
1139 2018-10-10 20:17:18 BREAKING: Stocks suffer worst loss in 8 months as rising interest rates pull investors out of the market; tech stocks hit hardest.

1142 2018-10-10 20:17:11 If you don't have the time to do that, stick to mutual funds, ETFs and avoid picking stocks altogether. #ShareInvestment
1143 2018-10-10 20:16:59 I’m thinking of investing my ISA allowance for this year....I’ve been put off due to expensive stocks most of this year....will wait for this sell off to end though
1144 2018-10-10 20:16:47 I guess we should expect to see craigslist flush with the sale of Yetis. Harleys & Nikes, trumpers will be rushing to Walmart, dollars in hand, asking which aisle the stocks are in..
1145 2018-10-10 20:16:46 • the dow dropped 800 points today
• nasdaq dropped 3.5%
• companies have been reporteding major multi-quarter losses
• tech investments are plummeting
• folks are being advised to change to defensive stocks

guess America really is great again, huh? #InThisEconomy
1146 2018-10-10 20:16:44 8th busiest trading day of the year in stocks.  The one's ahead of today were  Rus Rebal, SPX Reclass, and the VIX blowups.  Today was the real deal Holyfield in equity trading.
1147 2018-10-10 20:16:32 Uh oh, Trump is president and he stocks are plummeting. @realDonaldTrump
1148 2018-10-10 20:16:23 Then why did my stocks go up and my paycheck?
1149 2018-10-10 20:16:23 Not sure that is good or bad. While I like FB, owning stocks during contracting valuations is brutal- as we’ve seen in fb over the last 18 months
1150 2018-10-10 20:16:20 BREAKING (@AP): Stocks suffer worst loss in 8 months as rising interest rates pull investors out of market. The Dow industrials fell 831 points.
1151 2018-10-10 20:16:19 In other news, I heard $stocks are on sale today. Probably gonna pick me up a couple ;)
1152 2018-10-10 20:16:19 You're not wrong... I've just had a look at my US stocks 
1153 2018-10-10 20:16:10 Orange is the new black. I prefer orange. Black sucked. My stocks were in the dump for eight years. Just my Boeing stock shot up 150% since Trumps been in the office no complaining here. Good luck to each his own.
1154 2018-10-10 20:16:07 My concern in this sell off is tech/growth stocks. This is where the biggest damage will be. Selloff is healthy if it means real wage growth will finally rise thus contracting corporate margins a bit. With some tech up 1000% or more over last few years, a lot of room to sell off
1155 2018-10-10 20:16:06 Stocks are performing terribly since they announced the world ending  
1156 2018-10-10 20:16:00 The Dow fell 800 points and dipped below 26,000 for the first time in a month. All 30 Dow stocks were in the red. The Dow was on track to have its third-worst point drop ever. The Dow fell by more than 1,000 points twice this year their biggest ever. #ImpeachTrumpNow
1157 2018-10-10 20:15:57 @realDonaldTrump possibly the worst one day drop in stocks in the history of our country. Just using your own hyperbole to describe this #terrible stock drop.
1158 2018-10-10 20:15:46 Which is why you are seeing the stocks dropping led by big tech companies.
1159 2018-10-10 20:15:41 Right before 2008 election and Obama's win, same stock market issue appeared. Perhaps this is the liberals' way to redeem a bit of victory after the Kevanaugh debacle?  My prime suspect would be Soros plus other Dem heavyweights with tons of stocks they can dump. Think about it.
1160 2018-10-10 20:15:41 I have all my assets in stocks. But yes, it was a very good day. LOL I tend to "overhedge" at times.
1161 2018-10-10 20:15:40 But pot stocks showed resilience! In pot we trust! Until we don't.
1162 2018-10-10 20:15:37 If this happened to stocks everyday going forward forever, when would you stop buying the dip?
1163 2018-10-10 20:15:27 NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks suffer worst loss in 8 months as rising interest rates pull investors out of the market; tech stocks hit hardest.

1165 2018-10-10 20:15:07 The only stocks that didn’t take a dip today? Reefer.
1166 2018-10-10 20:15:06 Would big tech have the power to make this happen?  I heard it was their stocks leading this.
1167 2018-10-10 20:15:05 Falling crude and Bond Yield is good for our mkt. 

But very tough time for traders. One shld wait on the sidelines. NIFTY NEEDS to hold 10265.

If u have money do SIPs in stocks having strong fundamentals.
1168 2018-10-10 20:14:45 Market closed, dow down 831, and @CNBC tags it as STOCKS PLUNGE. It is only 3-4 % drop, we pay more than that in OHIO sales tax, (one county is 8%)  and think nothing of it!   Stay the course, allocate, and buy more if your time horizon permits.
1169 2018-10-10 20:14:43 Lol no. It's reacting to higher rates on the 10yr. Let me guess... You missed the run from 16k to 26k because you sold all your stocks after Trump's election, am I right? Leave investing to the adults...
1170 2018-10-10 20:14:36 And now I’m afraid the tech industry is trying to influence the mid term by tanking there own stocks.
1171 2018-10-10 20:14:35 I thought it was tech stocks?
1172 2018-10-10 20:14:27 Amazing numbers with the economy, growth is up,  consumer confidence is up, job numbers up, more jobs than folks looking for jobs, corporate profits up. Wait till holidays season & bonus get bigger, more spending ahead.
Buy on the dip and buy dividend paying stocks.
1173 2018-10-10 20:14:17 For those heavily in stocks,  we have found the 3rd meaning for [Red October]
1174 2018-10-10 20:14:14 Don’t throw stones when u live in a glass house. Millennials aren’t the ones selling off stocks.
1175 2018-10-10 20:14:09 I said weeks ago that the #Trumpanzee’s empire in stocks and shares was about to crash due to him and his trashy orange mouth! And guess what? My prediction is coming true!
1176 2018-10-10 20:14:06 Stocks extend fall; S&P500 down 3 percent, Dow down 3 percent, Nasdaq down 4 percent

1178 2018-10-10 20:13:44 Are you going to tell them about the stocks being down 750 points?
1179 2018-10-10 20:13:43 Interest rates and the hurricane hitting Florida - investors skittish about energy stocks/companies with damage from hurricane affecting their bottom line. Also a little bit of uncertainty about the tariffs & long term effects.
1180 2018-10-10 20:13:42 Liberals overreacting to stocks dropping 800 points In 3....2....1....
1181 2018-10-10 20:13:37 He reported on Nike’s stock going down immediately after it launched, which it did, and said it doesn’t prove anything bc stocks go up and down all the time
1182 2018-10-10 20:13:21 Only 17 stocks in the S&P 500 wound up finishing the day higher. Even utilities couldn't hold onto their gains.
1183 2018-10-10 20:13:09 700 point drop in DOW. I can hear the Dems "The sky is falling, the sky is falling" Half of my stocks were in the green all day. Readjustments happen.
1184 2018-10-10 20:13:05 I don't appear to have the ability to do that. It can put certain percentages into funds, but not individual stocks?
1185 2018-10-10 20:12:59 The US Stock market was so bad today that @realDonaldTrump had to make a statement.

1186 2018-10-10 20:12:58 How far can we fall in #stocks? I would say another 5-7% is very possible given how high valuations had gotten. In the big picture the market downturn will end when rates stop rising, and that should be at a top of around 3.4% on the 10-year #bond as stated a few days ago here.
1187 2018-10-10 20:12:56 Stocks dropping over 800 points today.  The tech industry was hit the hardest.  The Dow closing just under 25,600 points.
1188 2018-10-10 20:12:48 Wall Street Instant Update; #Stocks close@at session lows with the Dow Industrials dropping 831 at 25,599, Nasdaq falling 4.1% at 7422, the small cap Russell off 2,8%, S&P down 3.3% at 2785

1192 2018-10-10 20:12:30 Now you be sure to tell them how great you are.  Make sure they read the headline of the WSJ:  U.S. stocks posted their biggest decline in more than six months Wednesday, as investors accelerated their retreat from fast-growing technology stocks.   Winning is so much fun.
1193 2018-10-10 20:12:29 What kind of luck do I have? Well, When the market takes the biggest dump in two years, I have a short position in one of the handful of stocks that are actually up... #justluckyiguess
1194 2018-10-10 20:12:25 Those in stock market should routinely go over their investments to balance their risk between stocks, bond etc. Adjust your risks based on their age, if you can take time to bounce back or not. If you are more sophisticated, then can use hedging too. Don't just wait for a crash.
1195 2018-10-10 20:12:08 Damn stocks =(
1196 2018-10-10 20:11:55 Not if you have the pot stocks
1197 2018-10-10 20:11:50 A fear of something happening since the stocks have done nothing but go up for 2 years

1199 2018-10-10 20:11:26 All stocks are down in the gutters. Should we all be bracing??
1200 2018-10-10 20:11:07 As stocks plummet we’re gonna hazard a guess that, if Trump crashes the economy going into the midterms, that whole “Kavanaugh bump” thing probably isn’t going to do much for GOP candidates.
1201 2018-10-10 20:10:57 All the pundents will come on TV saying “keep buying stocks lower”. lol 

look at the massive negative divergences on the weekly and monthly charts of the major indices. We may be just getting started.
1202 2018-10-10 20:10:52 Recap:  Now you can REALLY see the effectiveness of the rules. Selling some into strength. Sell some losing 8 ema. Sell some losing 20 sma. Sell rest losing 50 day. NO round trips. Lock gains up. Never let good gain turn into a loss. Rules help.  Good job!  #stocks #investing
1203 2018-10-10 20:10:52 Not really when the GOP won't even pass legislation to outlaw and prevent sales of bump stocks and endless purchases of ARs by a single person as in the LV massacre. They got lucky the LV shooter didn't choose their field. LUCKY!!

1206 2018-10-10 20:10:44 I hate the fact Fox business is on the TV when I walk into work. In the AM: STOCKS ARE GREAT TRUMPS ECONOMY IS BOOMING SUCK IT LIBERALS Me leaving for lunch: STOCKS TAKE HISTORIC LOSS OH MAN YOU REALLY CANT PREDICT THIS STUFF LOL OH WELL
1207 2018-10-10 20:10:40 Remember during the Obama administration where conservatives would panic every time stocks would drop by like 2%? Shit's sliding like 5-10% today and nobody gives a shit. Because it doesn't matter. Because it's just gambling for rich people. But remember how much it "mattered"?
1208 2018-10-10 20:10:39 @TraderReformed not going to lie, days like these are extra sweet for a guy like me. When you've been bullish gold and gold stocks and bearish general equities for as long as I have, when it all comes together even for a brief moment it's awfully sweet. Also  1/2
1209 2018-10-10 20:10:30 And the 10 year note closed at a yield of 3.22.

It has been my position that both stocks and bonds would be in concurrent bear markets by October.
1210 2018-10-10 20:10:16 My guess: if stocks continue to decline over next days, President #Trump will publicly blame #Powell.
Kind of... "all great things we do on trade and taxes gets wiped out by Fed - that's not in interest of American people... "

1215 2018-10-10 20:09:38 Bye technology stocks. Is this stumble or an overdue reckoning for U.S stocks after months of outperforming global markets
1216 2018-10-10 20:09:38 All Stocks, Commodities, Bonds, Derivatives, Property etc are over valued by every metric. Consumers Confidence is at ATH, the Buffet Indicator is at ATH (both recessionary predictors).  Global debt is ATH.  Currencies are  ATH socialised debt too.

BTC is the first way out.

1221 2018-10-10 20:09:17 Cool, thanks! I need to get into that, I just feel stupid I did not do this weeks ago, since bearish signs where everywhere for stocks...
1222 2018-10-10 20:09:16 Great. I don't think I said all short sellers were guilty of anything. But I did include a paper that outlines how some short sellers have organized to drive down the price of some stocks.

Oh wait, you always leave out the 'complete' picture. Never mind . .

1226 2018-10-10 20:09:10 STOCKS:  DOW fell 831 points today.  Fox News is pushing its viewers to buy stocks.  trump and republicans need a strong stock market going into the elections.  It should be interesting to see what happens.  I'm standing aside

1229 2018-10-10 20:08:47 The Dow is down about 830 pts at this point in time...oops! Time for yet another massive corporate tax cut so they can do even more buy backs...or a fed QE to buy stocks...you know we can't possibly let the rich boys take a hit...I mean that's against the law now, isn't it?
1230 2018-10-10 20:08:41 Well 51% ownership with 50 million shares 
1231 2018-10-10 20:08:39 Fish that are in OUR WATERS BELONG TO US
We have every right to stop foreign boats fishing in UK waters as do other countries in their waters, but because they have over fished their stocks they come to the uk to over fish ours especially with pulse fishing.
1232 2018-10-10 20:08:32 gotta diversify outta tech stocks smh

1250 2018-10-10 20:07:10 The Dow closed down 831 points. Nasdaq dropped 315. So much for @realDonaldTrump on how great the market is doing under him. Growth under Obama was steady. This market is giving me whiplash. Not that I own any stocks, but I relish the idea of the 1% clutching their pearls.

Is this one of those situations where the stocks are falling due to the hurricane and the shady guys like Trump and company make money off of the drop?
1256 2018-10-10 20:06:44 So much bullish sell-side sentiment in my space and stocks getting decimated. But who dares to downgrade?
1257 2018-10-10 20:06:42 Idk. But all our favorite stocks are going on sale. Hope it continues a few days. Lol

1294 2018-10-10 20:04:27 So the DOW is down. Big tech companies way down. Could it be an upcoming interest rate increase and possibly Republicans selling off their big tech stocks after seeing the political bias and censorship. Some could be the response to Federal Reserve or did big tech really mess up?

1314 2018-10-10 20:03:18 @realDonaldTrump I wonder if you'll be bragging tonight at your Erie, PA rally about DOW Falling 817.22 points and plunging stocks today? 
#WednesdayWisdom
1315 2018-10-10 20:03:17 Don’t get me wrong, I appreciate all your insight and experience but when the market drops the way it did today, I’m sorry it is affecting penny stocks also
1316 2018-10-10 20:03:12 It's mental to take notice anyone's entry and exit points IMHO -even if true, useless without pos size & risk taken. Interesting to see what stocks ppl are talking about as a starting point for research, but impossible to judge quality of an investor (good or bad) via twitter.
1317 2018-10-10 20:03:11 The Hurricane and investors bearish on tech stocks I see
1318 2018-10-10 20:03:11 Most penny stocks have no correlation to the overall market.  Period. So when penny traders who don’t trade those macro markets like I do and make comments they are flat out wrong. Believe what you want but the data does not support this.
1319 2018-10-10 20:03:09 Thinking about adding the word "hella" to my commentary to gain more west coast appeal. "Hella nice back air" / "Falco has hella stocks right now" / "that was a hella mediocre edgeguard" and such

1322 2018-10-10 20:03:03 $VIX now up 100% in a week by my count. People can bet this is THE BIG ONE but I like buying stocks on a 3standard deviation daily move with $SPY RSI now back to Feb 9 closing low levels
1323 2018-10-10 20:03:01 Stocks update!

Dow  -820

For the week a lost of 4% volume.

1327 2018-10-10 20:02:51 $SPY if u're a relative strength/weakness trader, days like this are a GIFT to see the big players' hands. Look for large cap stocks that sell off a little when the market sells off bigly (relative strength). Historically, those tend to rebound the biggest when the market bounces

1345 2018-10-10 20:01:41 I’m not saying penny stocks aren’t going to run when the Dow dropped the way it did today, but 1 out of 4 will run, not 3 out of 4, 75% as opposed to 25%. Seems like the odds greatly change when the market is down
1346 2018-10-10 20:01:36 if the market drops huge, watch how fast #Trump "owns" it by clamoring "it's great stocks are cheap, you should buy stocks, they're cheap". He will make all the wrong calls and precipitate the deep recession the US avoided, which won't corrode the world b/c isolationism.

1348 2018-10-10 20:01:30 What exactly would they be investigating? Maybe I missed an earlier post or something. Are you asking them to investigate a short sellers opinion on a stock? There's like 20 million opinions a year on stocks?
1349 2018-10-10 20:01:24 Mark, you know it! I remember walking out of my office and telling the brokers,  "You're about to witness history."  This decline today is like Romper Room. Nothing. I remember, quality stocks, losing 20% of their value in a day! Wicked.

1398 2018-10-10 19:57:17 Sure I’d love for you to prove me wrong but I’d still have to disagree with you, if the market is down especially how it dropped today, how does that not have a correlation with stocks?

1409 2018-10-10 19:55:53 of course. Do you know the history of the monetary system? Currencies were by gold stocks. But now its trust... americans wont print bank notes to get more money than they actually think they worth... problem in Zim is cheating. Believing a credit card is real money
1410 2018-10-10 19:55:36 Not opening any new positions today, because I don't see any setups that match my edge. Even though it is tempting to dip-buy some stocks like $MSFT $SBUX and $PFE. Looks like stock-money is moving partly to gold mining stocks right now, but mostly just out of the markets.

1460 2018-10-10 19:47:07 Fresh update at 3.45 pm, just over 15 minutes before the stock market closes and the Dow Jones is now down almost 750 points. Tech stocks are down more than 150 points as well. This is a disaster as billions and billions of dollars are lost.
1461 2018-10-10 19:47:04 $SPX Into the close, you need to let em thru… Plebs are offsides, listening to @cnbc @jimcramer and every other Tom, Dick, and Pablo encouraging plebs to bid up stocks without reality is what moves the chains.. Analyst also guilty of fanning stupidity with mass upgrades..

1470 2018-10-10 19:46:00 I find it interesting and confusing as to why the Catholic Church would require stocks, investments, to hold sooo much wealth 1.6 billion alone in investments on the stock exchange.  So much gold, silver precious gems , works of art and ancient books. 1/
1471 2018-10-10 19:45:59 @FoxBusiness No one is talking about the reason for stocks diving today could be that a Cat 5 hurricane is going to destroy thr Fl. Panhadle..??
1472 2018-10-10 19:45:42 The Dow fell more than 600 points and dipped below 26,000 for the first time in a month. The S&P 500 was on track for its fifth straight decline. And tech stocks were getting hit particularly hard. The Nasdaq dropped 3.1%.
1473 2018-10-10 19:45:39 In our opinion this appears to be a machine/ROBO a sell off to this degree IS NOT "HUMAN" Based but MACHINE/ROBO based.  When STOCKS drop below their 200 Day Moving Averages a Machine SELL OFF takes place.
1474 2018-10-10 19:45:27 Great episode. With security tokens being all the rage in Wall Street, the current lack of a secondary market for liquidity could result in a plethora of very low market cap security tokens, similar to penny stocks.
1475 2018-10-10 19:45:25 Stocks took a pounding today and probably turned some heads. Heighten vigilance around the stock market for sure. This week through next will be telling... #NASDAQ #SP500 #DOWJ

1480 2018-10-10 19:44:16 DOWN 700+ POINTS: The Dow is down over 700 points due to climbing bond yields that are hovering at a more-than-seven-year high. Tech stocks are getting especially hammered, as investors want to take risk out of their portfolios. #CNN

1482 2018-10-10 19:43:43 Yes.  Shangri-la, China.  This pullback on $QQQ is too deep.  If we get some upside soon, I'm thinking a h/s pattern.  Originally I thought we hit the top July - August.  But, I heard stocks do well going into mid-terms.  Well we're close to mid-terms.

1496 2018-10-10 19:41:01 just sold all of my stocks today. please don’t speak to me i’m busy being rich.
1497 2018-10-10 19:40:59 I know many are panicking on stocks, and with a general double top in most indices, it's understandable. But the key I'm waiting for is a sharp close below the 200-day on the $Nasdaq. If that happens, US markets are in for a bumpy ride over the rest of the week.

1502 2018-10-10 19:40:02 Well, I’ve been wondering if uranium stocks would be affected by a general market sell-off.. today we got our answer.
1503 2018-10-10 19:39:47 Interest rates are rising, stocks are falling, budget and trade deficits are exploding, as autos, homebuilders, and financials are all flashing recession.  If you think you've seen this movie before, you're half right. It's a sequel to 2008, but the ending will be much worse!

I write off expenses against income. I bought stocks in Biotech over last month. Take a deep breath relax.
1508 2018-10-10 19:39:05 If $TGOD stocks falls below $5 also their ability to get an uptick from a possible up-listing comes into question as they wouldn’t likely qualify. Crucial three months for the stock here. #PotStocks
1509 2018-10-10 19:38:57 The IBD 50 is down 5% and almost 14% in just eight days. FANG stocks are getting hammered!  I expect pessimism to to spike either today or very soon, but that doesn't rule out additional downside before a trading low is established.

1511 2018-10-10 19:38:55 If thinking of your portfolio makes you anxious , then it is likely one of these reasons:
- Your time horizon is too short.
- Your stocks have too much leverage.
- You have too much leverage. 
- Your investment thesis is wrong but you don't want to admit it.

1528 2018-10-10 19:37:16 Remember, all computers day-trading stocks picked up on the sell idea earlier today.  They don't have a 20-year horizon though so I won't be joining them.
1529 2018-10-10 19:37:08 Just an FYI - negative carry (current condition) and negative trend (ambiguous currently) has been a terrible combo for stocks.

1531 2018-10-10 19:36:45 It's not like the Dow correction writing hasn't been on the wall. "Longest bull run in history." "How do I get into pot stocks?" "DOW sets new ATH today after ATH achieved day before."

1542 2018-10-10 19:34:55 Come on Peter, we've been through this. Fed will pause, phrase it as "accommodation", stocks and bonds will rally, enriching the few and allowing the bankrupt government to continue. Nothing breaks until the world rejects the dollar.

Why stocks are plunging

Tech is taking its lumps because bond yields have climbed in recent weeks, hovering at a more-than-seven-year high.
1547 2018-10-10 19:33:50 can we say that stocks people are moving the money into crypto ?
1548 2018-10-10 19:33:33 Please have your reporters site specific examples of the “strong economy.” Job creation numbers have been average or under. Inflation is rising. New home builds and sales, car manufacturing all down. Consumer prices are up as are interest rates. Stocks have been a rollercoaster.

1557 2018-10-10 19:32:16 There are large stocks of smallpox vaccine in storage but their potency is unknown. There is no smallpox circulating in any population around the globe (humans are the only host) so there is no current vaccine production. Things could change rapidly if thawing permafrost

1576 2018-10-10 19:28:09 $CGC $APH $ACB $TRST - next rally incominggg  7 days until legalization - let's gooooo  Tons of short interest open on these stocks right now. Shits about to get real. We haven't even announced deals yet, only rumors. Wait till Nov Dec when we close
1577 2018-10-10 19:28:01 this market drop is killing me my stocks be down $100 dollars in the last month RIP
1578 2018-10-10 19:27:27 Still the stocks should be more lower.

1580 2018-10-10 19:27:04 Stocks are taking a bloodbath right before the midterm...
1581 2018-10-10 19:27:01 Big money knows a bull run is imminent and a crash for stocks are as well. So no not entirely IMO
1582 2018-10-10 19:26:56 America needs term limits, and no campaign contributions. As we study the inside trading done by Congress and bills that were voted on after people purchased stocks etc. we will learn the truth. Everyone has an axe held over their heads by someone.
1583 2018-10-10 19:26:52 Sanctions are punishments, pure n simple.  They would prefer to put us in stocks then have us publicly flogged but that would be problematic SO we are sanctioned instead.

1587 2018-10-10 19:25:57 Wow. Literally nothing cooler than getting cheap shoes because a store stocks something hyped and is completely incompetent on how to sell or market them

1590 2018-10-10 19:25:39 Half a billion dollars just flowed into crypto market cap in last hour. Huh, wonder why? #stockmarketcrash2018
#stocks #stockmarket
1591 2018-10-10 19:25:33 US stock market is artificial. Trump just gaming the books by creating a huge deficit through tax cuts, allowing companies to do stock buybacks and see their share prices rise. 

US stocks will crash too, in time for the GOP to lose Congress and Trump to blame the Democrats.
1592 2018-10-10 19:25:28 A4: Stocks, bonds, 401(k), IRAs are great options to consider.  #creditchat
1593 2018-10-10 19:25:13 your local hot topic still stocks blood on the dance floor shirts
1594 2018-10-10 19:24:48 $MLHC and $RSHN are my main stocks that i will support on way up as I have been.  I didnt sell either , not saying im sharpest tool in shed for that, but I am long on these positions and rather deal with dips then miss out on any intra day reverses.  I see both making huge moves
1595 2018-10-10 19:24:47 Reminder that the half of Americans who own 0 stocks could care less about this selloff
1596 2018-10-10 19:24:24 Stocks down - is this The Big One @TheBubbleBubble?
1597 2018-10-10 19:24:23 Is it weird that over the last month or so I have started to think of bitcoin as low risk and stocks as risky?
1598 2018-10-10 19:24:05 So the @WSJ all the way from New York using their influence and endorsing Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil. Good for markets no doubt. Pity he says some women are too ugly to be raped, blacks should be in zoos, that if his son was gay he'd rather he was dead. "But look at the stocks."
1599 2018-10-10 19:24:00 Okay holy shit am I glad I sold all my stocks when I did. I'd be in the red right now if I hadn't.

1601 2018-10-10 19:23:43 @T1mClarke can someone please fix sharepad so I can screen some stocks........it’s going to be bed time soon.....
1602 2018-10-10 19:23:33 But first let me purchase my preemptive stocks of AquaNet hairspray.
1603 2018-10-10 19:23:32 If you own stocks, you need to tune in now, Dow -600 pts, flight to quality so far not happening. Investors almost frozen beyond pressing the sell button. Are they missing buying opportunities or should they wait til dust settles?
1604 2018-10-10 19:23:29 All stocks in red today, yikes...
1605 2018-10-10 19:22:52 Stocks are rekt. Buy bitcoin $BTC
1606 2018-10-10 19:22:51 Didn’t Mr Wonderful love small cap stocks the last month?
1607 2018-10-10 19:22:43 $PYX $IGC $TLRY $NBEV. So I guess weed stocks are the new $SPY hedge?
1608 2018-10-10 19:22:40 Since the stock market is in the longest bull run in history I think we are waiting for a crash unfortunately. My guess is the mid term voting will be a ton of dumping in the stocks pushed by Soros creating a crash and they will turn to crypto for gains
1609 2018-10-10 19:22:14 2 Healthcare Stocks Analysts Call "Buys"Wed Oct 10 14:07:40 2018 EDT
Stocks are getting hammered today, with the tech sector leading the pullback. Three healthcare names making big moves are (MYGN), :RARX), :ACRX). Check out what's happening with shares of MYGN, RARX, and ACRX
1610 2018-10-10 19:22:08 Stocks are down again. Guidance for earnings down for the rest of the year.

So sad that its closed now that btc is doing nothing and there is a clear play on stocks... well, can catch em all.
1613 2018-10-10 19:21:23 funny thing about days like today, heavily shorted stocks tend to do relatively well, long / short managers lets say they are running 100 / 50 (100% long 50% short) then for every $100 of length they pair back risk on,  they "buy" in $50 their shorts
1614 2018-10-10 19:21:08 @jimcramer Armageddon? Or stocks on a mark down sale? Cramer, what's your advice for home gamers?

1617 2018-10-10 19:20:28 Sean would say that a crash is imminent. But there are pockets of stocks that will do well in a crash, or that one should be ready to buy when market falls. But u must follow your gut. Check out his site. Its free to do so :) [Again, I am not advertising ]

1625 2018-10-10 19:18:30 10-year Treasury yield now DOWN for the session as stocks continue to tumble.
1626 2018-10-10 19:18:27 Woke up with hella notifications from robinhood of stocks dropping. Indeed wasn’t just the few stocks I was watching... it was the entire stock market 
1627 2018-10-10 19:18:27 Yikes. Good I am not trading stocks...oh wait...I do crypto.. 
1628 2018-10-10 19:18:20 I don't care if you're a "Boglehead" or "Buy and hold" type person....on days like today...you're watching the market.  #money #investing #stocks #retirement

1639 2018-10-10 19:17:01 A $BTC flatliner price today, in a day when stocks and bonds are getting crushed, is likely noticed by the whole world and is very bullish. Waiting.
1640 2018-10-10 19:16:47 Which stocks will be hit hardest and which do you think will have the greatest recovery in the shortest time?
1641 2018-10-10 19:16:32 yields on treasuries up-
downward pressure on stocks
1642 2018-10-10 19:16:31 Meanwhile the $XLU is hardly off. Someone is in there buying individual stocks in utilities. This is the second time this market tested the January highs and completely tanked afterwards.
1643 2018-10-10 19:16:23 They were buying value stocks all morning, now they're selling those too!
1644 2018-10-10 19:16:20 Remember: Headlines don’t drive equities, fundamentals do. #StockMarket #SP500 #investing #personalfinance #markets #stocks
1645 2018-10-10 19:16:19 BTW -- -84ish now.  I don't overly worry about the exact number as stocks don't turn in minutes off a low NYMO/NAMO.  It's usually a multi-day process.
1646 2018-10-10 19:16:13 Land o lakes is the brand that my store stocks in the deli. It really is good.
1647 2018-10-10 19:16:09 Buy low sell high.   Stocks are high.  Experts been talking correction for some time.  Tech is booming

1651 2018-10-10 19:15:20 COMPARED TO TODAY’S RANGE (20181010 3:14 pm ET)
0.4% of stocks are in the top 10% of today’s range.
1.9% are in the top 20%.
7.3% are in the top half. 92.7% of stocks are in the bottom half of today’s range.
77.3% are in the bottom 20%.
63.2% are in the bottom 10%.

1656 2018-10-10 19:14:32 Shall we stick them in stocks now. It’s disgusting they are forced to do this. The pressshould report on important things like homelessness, disabilty cuts, global warming , teacher shortages cutbacks causing severe hardship not a snog#@bbcstrictly #getalife

1658 2018-10-10 19:14:06 After the avgs have come off by several percent, ironically it is preferable to see volume and volatility increase in order to shake out weaker hands and create the conditions for a bottom #stocks
1659 2018-10-10 19:14:05 Mining stocks are not tanking. Actually GDX and GDXJ had nice intraday reversal. They are up a little, for now. If this is real change in trend we need gold and especially silver getting bit.

1668 2018-10-10 19:13:11 It's a real correction. Not lots of smiles on our trading floor... Hang in there. It happens to keep everyone honest. Stocks down 2.5% now on the day.

1673 2018-10-10 19:12:20 It's amazing how many stocks are hit hard today but are still significantly higher than they were at the start of the year. Some of them may need to fall more than 30% to get to that level.
1674 2018-10-10 19:12:18 Stocks with expected earnings reports tomorrow:
$CBSH, $DAL, $EXFO, $SAR, $TYHT, $THST, $WBA.

1678 2018-10-10 19:10:38 1) The Big Chill seems to be setting into the market in early Oct. The 55 largest SaaS stocks had an incredible run, rising 61% on average through the end of 3Q18 (September 28, 2018) vs. Nasdaq +13% benefitting from robust secular tailwinds (cloud, digital) #SaaS

1684 2018-10-10 19:10:07 Agree with that. Ben Graham would argue that those types of stocks are in a sale at times like this, a good company does not stop being a good company because it’s share price falls. Liquidity also a factor do you think?

1687 2018-10-10 19:08:58 Decliners with a whopping 6:1 edge today. Except for $HD (think Hurricane Michael) all Dow stocks are red. Only 58 of the 500 $SPX stocks are green.
1688 2018-10-10 19:08:57 how about stocks today though holy shït
1689 2018-10-10 19:08:36 It was simply a marketing gimmick by @Flipkart to undercut @amazonIN.. They barely had any stocks for the iPhone X.
1690 2018-10-10 19:08:01 @fred_guttenberg Sir, I just want you to know of my intense sadness for your loss of your beautiful daughter. You hv my full support in the NEED for gun control. There's NO REASON for assault rifles, bump stocks, silencers, etc! I live in NE, I hv 3 adult sons, 1 girl in college.
1691 2018-10-10 19:07:40 U.S. stocks, bonds, and the dollar all falling together is a warning sign that the party is coming to an end. Once gold breaks out it will officially be over.  Then look out below.  How long before the Fed capitulates, and will a policy reversal stop the decline or accelerate it?
1692 2018-10-10 19:07:21 Again you cannot say what's going to happen just as I cannot either.. As yes fish don't follow borders but whilst they are in UK waters we should stop foreign boats plundering our stocks...
1693 2018-10-10 19:07:18 Oui mais là c'est des stocks de greniers qui traine dans la cour.
1694 2018-10-10 19:06:35 QE: Stocks and Bonds go bid. QT = (QE * -1). Go figure.
1695 2018-10-10 19:06:28 so nice to see that the crypto markets don't seem to give a fuck about US stocks at all anymore
1696 2018-10-10 19:06:03 Warren has slightly deeper pockets than most and can ride out some big waves that would drown mortals. The usual sign to sell stocks is when non specialists are advising each other to invest in stocks;-)
1697 2018-10-10 19:05:55 Bonds, stocks, the dollar, & oil all selling off. 
1698 2018-10-10 19:05:50 Down the spectrum I agree - you have stocks breaking 7-8pc on a handful of small sells. However the index move has been driven by the AIM supercaps - FEVR, ASC, BUR, BOO, etc, where you’d think instutions dictate the price largely (and are clearly selling!)
1699 2018-10-10 19:05:42 US stocks crash at any time, china stock shares are about to rise, see what else you can take to zhuangbi
1700 2018-10-10 19:05:33 $GTII is legit one of my favorite penny stocks in 2018!!
WOWIE
1701 2018-10-10 19:05:19 I agree with Rhom, stick to decent, sensibly valued stocks. I personally add as the market goes lower, but obviously you need cash available to do so. And these things can go on a lot longer than you expect, or they can be over in days. No fixed pattern.
1702 2018-10-10 19:05:10 Two of my stocks paid dividends today, trash ass dividends thanks to this dwindling ass market.
1703 2018-10-10 19:05:03 @Vanguard_Group I can now see my individual account info, access stocks-funds-etf areas, but can’t access CD/bond area. Just get blank white page, been like that since last night.
1704 2018-10-10 19:05:01 Yes of course stocks should tank as the economy continues to improve.  Said no one -ever

1708 2018-10-10 19:03:26 Stocks, bonds and dollar all sold down today.
1709 2018-10-10 19:03:23 The stocks which lead this rally, $AMZN $FB $NFLX $AAPL are all significantly off their highs and not looking strong.
1710 2018-10-10 19:03:18 If $BTC breaks out of pennant today, as #STOCKS dip hard.. it’ll be the single most bullish event in Bitcoin history.

1713 2018-10-10 19:03:03 J'ai clairement pas pu imprimer tout ce que je voulais, donc j'ai très peu de stock pour samedi. En plus de ça j'ai pas pu imprimer le dos, donc je vais devoir tout faire à la main. Et j'ai pas retrouvé mes stocks de badges. J'en ai marre de cette journée T-T
1714 2018-10-10 19:02:59 Remember. Stocks are collateral for the entire sysytem now.
1715 2018-10-10 19:02:51 #WednesdayWisdom: High flying stocks like $AMZN ("it's going to $3,000") $NFLX, $BABA etc do not pay dividends & probably won't for several yrs.
They get crushed on days like this. The older you are, the more conservative you should be. #ILoveDividends #DividendsforOldFarts #DOW
1716 2018-10-10 19:02:37 I have no clue what windbag Cramer was talking about. I try to mute that guy as often as possible.

But what this gentleman was conveying re the auto industry and the importance to these stocks to the overall market today versus 30 years ago is true.
1717 2018-10-10 19:02:36 Oct 4-Analysis: Federal Reserve prepares for next crisis, bets it will begin like the last. Well folks the night story-I'm a realistic person & have saying this a 2006 & a prelude to a big market sell-off. Too much insanity taking place! Stay short indexes! #Commodities #Stocks

1719 2018-10-10 19:02:29 For associates that were already make $15/hr or above, we are also getting a raise to compensate for the loss of the VCP(Monthly bonus), Also we get to keep the stocks that we had already earned.
1720 2018-10-10 19:02:06 I’m not desperate for anything. The only thing I’m analyzing is the role the Kap ad has played in Nike stock. It’s dropped. You can’t argue that it hasn’t. Stocks fluctuate over time, but it’s not been a good month for them by any means.
1721 2018-10-10 19:01:52 Tobacco stocks doing well.  Buy low, stay high.
1722 2018-10-10 19:01:31 The markets getting hammered today as 10 yr 3.22% 10 year high pressure on stocks.

1735 2018-10-10 18:59:07 Still using chip stocks as their weapon of choice... $SOX failed to test the intraday low on this pullback, and now it's up 6 off the low again... it was close down there but no cigar.

1737 2018-10-10 18:58:21 What they do not realize is that Trump is not for them he is only about himself and his self enrichment, the tax cuts were for the rich but for some reason that do not see that.  The wage increase were only done by a small % the Co's put it all back in Stocks, Trump is getting 2/

1739 2018-10-10 18:58:17 It's an #AVALANCHE as we head into the last hour of the #NYSE trading day as the $DJIA sheds over 500+ points!  All Major Indexes down over 2% $RUT $SPX $COMP $NASD $DIA $SPY $QQQ $IWM.  This effect is further fueled by #Tradebot and #EAs kicking sells @ #EMA crossovers.  #stocks
1740 2018-10-10 18:58:08 So, with auto stocks near multi-year lows, it's worth noting that the UAW retiree medical benefits trust is one of GM's biggest stakeholders. How's all that "winning" feel, I wonder? That new NAFTA feel good to you?
1741 2018-10-10 18:57:52 Off subject a bit. Stocks are a bit scary today. Are Dems going to have a recession to fix, Again?

1744 2018-10-10 18:56:55 It appears the #Stocks selloff is likely to continue. The #SP500 fell to a 7 week low, the #Dow dropped 500 pts, and the #Nasdaq dove over 2.5%. A clear sign of bearish sentiment in #WallStreet
1745 2018-10-10 18:56:25 it's been a while that gold is up when stocks are down.
1746 2018-10-10 18:56:13 I personally like the idea that $BTC is holding up while stocks/bonds collapse.   I  think when those two markets stablize, Bitcoin will lead the charge higher!!
1747 2018-10-10 18:55:36 A $BTC breakout today, in a day when stocks and bonds are getting crushed, would be noticed by the whole world and would be very bullish. Waiting.

1755 2018-10-10 18:54:05 Unfair. It’s not a religion. He’s not a 50pe stock buyer. But he is valuing growthy garp stocks a bit more. “Ditching their principles” is a way of slurring adaptation.
1756 2018-10-10 18:53:58 Via @AP: Stocks are extending their slump on Wall Street, led by drops in big  technology companies, as rising bond yields draw investors out of stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell as much as 519 points in afternoon  trading Wednesday. #economy #blackwednesday

1759 2018-10-10 18:53:37 @SquawkCNBC Hey @BeckyQuick   Question for you:  How, at all, do Interest Rate Hikes impact high dividend stocks?
1760 2018-10-10 18:53:31 Stocks are risky assets, not only do they go up they can also decline.  Who would’ve thought?!?! So many people sadly forget this
1761 2018-10-10 18:53:03 Stocks fell Wednesday as concerns about global economic growth and  ongoing trade tensions continued to hang over Wall Street and after the  bond market resumed a sell-off that started last week.
1762 2018-10-10 18:53:00 Gold miners, utility stocks, and some homebuilders hanging on to gains on the day.

1766 2018-10-10 18:52:19 Stocks extend their slump, led by drops in big technology names; Dow industrials lose 500 points, or 2 percent.

But Trump said the economy is the greatest ever.

1770 2018-10-10 18:51:46 Venus retro is pummeling US Stocks again today. How long can Crypto hold out ? Not very long in my opinion, we think steeper declines are coming soon. The big question now is will the yearly support level hold ?

1780 2018-10-10 18:49:33 Venus retro continues to correlate with a pounding to US Stocks. Rising Bond yields appear to be a game changer for the markets. Is this a healthy correction or a sign of bigger problems ahead ? Venus continues it's retro until NOV 16th, not buying this dip yet.

They're selling everything state side....  Let's see if Trump retreats

1785 2018-10-10 18:49:17 So just to be clear...you think the Nike stock is independent of all the other stocks falling today including a 500+ drop in the DJIA? 
1786 2018-10-10 18:48:49 Bonds down and stocks down. Still not fleeing into safety. Might be still rate fear driven sell off.

1794 2018-10-10 18:47:28 S&P500 is down under 4% from its 2018 high.  Hardly a crash.  A small correction precipitated by a new high in US bond rates and a big continuing sector rotation out of growth and bond-equivalent stocks; tech-heavy NASDAQ is really taking losses.  It's -10% for "a correction."
1795 2018-10-10 18:47:25 #US Late Afternoon: DOW's mild up-start soon turned to a steep dip, with WallSt's losses headed by #NASDAQ ↓-2.63% 7,534.42, with #DJIA ↓-2.14% 25,865.19 & #SP500 ↓-2.16% 2,817.91. Software, Luxury, Entertainment stocks noteworthy losers. #Microsoft -3.6%.

1808 2018-10-10 18:44:06 Who cares. Just keep buying and reinvesting those high dividends while you have a chance. Or take a shot at those nasty FANG over bought stocks with no parachute.
1809 2018-10-10 18:43:49 heres some basic knowledge about Stocks and Currency for you:

if any US stocks are bullish "usually" it means the USD is bearish. why?the shares are cheap(due to USD being bearish)so people are buying the stocks when its cheap.
1810 2018-10-10 18:43:48 The stock market is bad today seems like everybodies stocks are down.
1811 2018-10-10 18:43:47 @AOTtrades one thing that has bothered me in the run up, BULL market..housing stocks have gone south..even with good earnings.  Housing has to be a leader in robust markets..but maybe they reacted to rising interest rates before the market did
1812 2018-10-10 18:43:37 WTF is Motley Fool speculating for? These stocks don't even sell for anything close to what you buy for. They would have to double for you to make anything. Is this just an advertisement platform? I don't need to follow spam.
1813 2018-10-10 18:43:18 Transit town like Chivhu & Mvuma always have stocks. I'm not sure cause of this but I think it's first time it has runout of stock for a while and increased prices. 2 piecer is  now at $6,50.

1824 2018-10-10 18:39:57 There's more pain to come for stocks, according to analysts watching the charts ...
1825 2018-10-10 18:39:48 If rates keep rising it will put pressure on risk assets, like stocks. In an extreme case (much higher rates), why wouldn’t you weight more toward bonds vs stocks. This of course assumes bonds are safe...
1826 2018-10-10 18:39:40 Just had a quick look at the S&P 500 stocks and there are some big falls in Oils and Consumer Credit alongside tech.... messy
1827 2018-10-10 18:39:07 @timothysykes don’t think he’s correct on this one, how could the market tanking not be in direct correlation with stocks if 3 out of 4 stocks follow the market. Hmm 
1828 2018-10-10 18:39:05 Comes up every time stocks look like dumping because low equity vols made stocks allocation attractive. Part of me thinks fixed income vol continues to show more upside for the moment...unless we get a stocks correction (double digits), in which case we worry about wider issues..

1836 2018-10-10 18:36:37 generally speaking this should continue though. Maybe not intraday precisely, but if tightening policy detracts from equity risk premium the trajectory of bond *prices* and stocks should generally start to align more closely.

1845 2018-10-10 18:34:31 Stocks and crypto could also be completely uncorrelated at this point.

1848 2018-10-10 18:34:11 Most of the top stocks that ARE cheap going forward and have gained 50% or more the last year or so have come off 6 or 7% the last two days.  MM’s making sure they’re covered.  Falls shouldn’t be as steep from now on 
1849 2018-10-10 18:33:50 I’d put them in the stocks for a week, allowing passing livestock to wee on their heads.
1850 2018-10-10 18:33:16 stocks are crashing--down almost 500 points--not FAKE news----Ford laying off thousands--not FAKE news---GM laying off thousands--not FAKE news---people across the world know you have serious emotional issues--not FAKE news----just RESIGN!!!!!!!!!!!!
1851 2018-10-10 18:32:52 Dow drops 500 points as October rout continues, tech stocks lead slide. Investors know, tech is about to be hit with antitrust suits, many being broke up as monopoly's to control an ideology, and free speech.

1857 2018-10-10 18:31:47 WSJ reports:

"U.S. stocks dropped sharply Wednesday as an ongoing surge in Treasury yields pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average down about 500 points and put the S&P 500 on pace for its longest losing streak in nearly two years"
1858 2018-10-10 18:31:41 What’s the difference of all the adidas stocks. There is .de, .d etc
1859 2018-10-10 18:31:40 @McDONewt I listen to your show every chance I get. My wife & I also went to one of your major events a few years ago at the Convention Ctr in Bellevue. You recommend a Vanguard world wide fund with basically all the stocks but I can’t remember the symbol. Can you help me?
1860 2018-10-10 18:31:37 Stocks extend their slump, led by drops in big technology names; Dow industrials lose 500 points, or 2 percent.
1861 2018-10-10 18:30:57 I’m willing to buy those stocks at a discount
1862 2018-10-10 18:30:56 Notice how after the weak 10-year auction stocks started moving down more

Silver lining to the higher long-term yields -the yield curve is steepening today so yields are moving up for good reasons - b/c maybe the economy is actually doing well for real! Real yields a also higher
1863 2018-10-10 18:30:27 Anyone hungry? Stocks getting rocked today. But the big winners in S&P 500? Food companies. $SJM $GIS $CPB $K $KHC among the few gainers.

1870 2018-10-10 18:29:36 Same, I'm basically a long only and not panicking, long term it will be good. Actually shaved most profitable positions before end of quarter and decided to add a couple new stocks this week.

1876 2018-10-10 18:28:27 La Secretaria de Agroindustria retomo la publicación de los datos de stocks de granos depositados en acopios, terminales portuarias y establecimientos industriales. Cambio la fuente, antes era la Dirección Nacional de Fiscalización y a partir de marzo la fuente es la AFIP.
1877 2018-10-10 18:28:21 So let me get this straight, since you obviously, don't trade stocks.  It should be illegal because Eloon said so.  It's a trading strategy like going long, there are several ways to short stock, you can use put options. Or you can use the traditional way of shorting.

Wait until next year or the year after, I promise all the houses will be affordable foreclosures, and the stocks CHEAP. Recession benefits us if we save to take advantage of others' pain ~sarcasm~
1882 2018-10-10 18:26:43 Stocks:  trump and republican economic policies are starting to show up in economy...they damaged China and Europe economies ...trump said China can't do anything about it...maybe China is showing trump...selling USA stock and bond holding...
1883 2018-10-10 18:26:41 1. Bad data out on tech. Chip stocks in particular taking a beating some of which driven by US-China tensions / supply chain doubts. 2. Rising rates starting to matter more than recent investor expectations..
1884 2018-10-10 18:26:10 ... when can I buy stocks BTW?
1885 2018-10-10 18:26:08 Only holds true if cod has actually disappeared, which it hasn't. However some other important factors also impact on finfish stocks outside of fishing, such as seal predation. Lots of factors feed into a whole system.
1886 2018-10-10 18:26:03 Rap is like stocks now ppl invest they time into a artist in hopes they'll make it big

1904 2018-10-10 18:20:01 Cheap liquidity is the reason stocks were as high as they were. As it gets more expensive the bubble will pop again. Nearly all economic growth over the last decade has been a show put on by central bank policy and money supply growth. There is no strong economy.

1922 2018-10-10 18:17:10 The USA ran up deficit by a trillion to give money to ultra rich and corporations so they can buy back stocks and run up market so they can dump them later and make billions. Meanwhile common guy paying more for everything due to tariff and high gas prices.

1932 2018-10-10 18:16:03 The last year both stocks and bonds had meaningful, simultaneous losses was 1994 - ironic that in both 1994 and 2018 we negotiated a North American trade deal
1933 2018-10-10 18:15:52 Awesome!! But if we have that much money, then having an asset portfolio across stocks, gold, real-estate, bonds, cryptos etc. would make sense.. and that too with only 50% of our investment at max; rest should be sitting in safe place.
1934 2018-10-10 18:15:50 NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks extend their slump, led by drops in big technology names; Dow industrials lose 500 points, or 2 percent.
1935 2018-10-10 18:15:31 Agreed, it depends on the risk tolerance of each person. When there is a mass Exodus from stocks,  many will look to a new asset class for opportunity. People do not trust in banks anymore. So the alternative is Gold / silver / digital assets.
1936 2018-10-10 18:15:16 I am not a licensed securities advisor but my personal strategy has always been to make consistent contributions over time but to maximize investments in stocks when the market takes a big dip. Now might be the time to start increasing contributions
1937 2018-10-10 18:15:13 Investing should be boring. If you're not bored with your stocks, you're speculating.
1938 2018-10-10 18:15:13 Stocks falleng 4 days straight, some chain stores  closing, $12 billion b/o for farmers, Harley moving some manufacturing overseas, goods going up in cost  due to tariffs.

1939 2018-10-10 18:15:09 Dollar falls in Europe.

1969 2018-10-10 18:10:30 Okay, what’s really going on with stocks?  What’s the real story?  Can’t just be rates and/or tariffs as both are well known.  War?  Plague?

1972 2018-10-10 18:09:57 Land mark day for overpriced US stocks: for first time on a deep sell off of stocks, bond yields still rising: normally sell off would go into bonds reducing yield.

1982 2018-10-10 18:07:05 Will see. Just because nifty has to go down, if it does, it doesn't mean our stocks are to fall. Neither did india rise when USA rose. I think more pressure on tech than others
1983 2018-10-10 18:06:57 Bought #Sears #SHLD #stocks but sold it within minutes after some thoughts on a CEO out for himself. Sears could have made a comeback.

1984 2018-10-10 18:06:57 My last word on this - Equity trades at a multiple. Stocks are super money. Build a biz u take public and it sells for 10 - 20x or more. Equity compensation is given at market and already marked up. It is simple ... sorry u don’t get it.

1988 2018-10-10 18:04:09 So what do you think about ghengis khan, he killed 10% of the world's population without one single gun? Guess that was cause of ar-15s and bump stocks and shitty gun laws.
1989 2018-10-10 18:03:53 If commodities are rising, bonds have started to fall and stocks are still charging forward. These relationships will eventually overcome the bullishness in stocks, which will be forced to retreat at a certain point.
1990 2018-10-10 18:03:42 The Presidential Alert I got on my cell phone said: "Sell Stocks."

1994 2018-10-10 18:01:58 All I see is $OGI halt, nothing else. Man pot stocks...never a dull moment good or bad
1995 2018-10-10 18:01:34 I’ve covered basically all of my protection & just bought a few stocks back that I sold much higher... still room to fall, 10-20% positions!
1996 2018-10-10 18:01:18 When bond prices begin to fall, stocks will eventually follow suit and head down as well. As borrowing becomes more expensive and the cost of doing business rises due to inflation, it is reasonable to assume that companies (stocks) will not do as well.
1997 2018-10-10 18:00:54 As I have said before, the junkers usually have it right. Stocks are next. It will be a colossal downturn. The "this time it's different crowd" are about to learn that it isn't.
1998 2018-10-10 18:00:50 Probably can't say what I'm buying professionally... Personally? How do you feel about micro/nano cap stocks?
1999 2018-10-10 18:00:44 I have to be honest and say that, from what I've seen, these Antifa clowns are pussies. One on one they are nothing, NADA! Once the dam bursts, there's gonna be a lot of money to be made in Pharma stocks. p.s. Soros needs to swing. He is an enemy of the people ... period!

2010 2018-10-10 17:57:11 Ouch yeah my tech stocks are getting shafted
2011 2018-10-10 17:56:34 @BarrySchwartzBW 100% agreed. What should be working is the high growth, high margin stocks and banks cause of the spread. Utilities and companies with low margins and high capital deployment should not. Like you said, some days it’s just down #investing #trading #TomsTruths
2012 2018-10-10 17:56:33 If the Dems win we will have gridlock for two years. Could be a move out of those stocks that will be impacted by that gridlock.
2013 2018-10-10 17:56:14 More than 50% of stocks in the S&P 500 were in correction territory. At midday, 295 of the S&P's 505 components — or 58 percent of the index — had fallen by 10 percent or more from their 52-week highs. #stats #breath #stocks #leadership #S&P500
2014 2018-10-10 17:56:06 When can we start buying according to you... Generally a bear mkt lasts for around 12 months... We started falling in Jan.. so around 10 months already done... When should we start buying our high conviction stocks
2015 2018-10-10 17:55:35 That's great for African Americans.  Trade war has been happening for a while.  We are finally standing up to getting taken advantage of.  I knew this would happen.  Sold 75% of my stocks over the last few months.  It's mind-blowing to me that you want the ship to sink!
2016 2018-10-10 17:55:07 Any China stocks are toxic... China may fall into a recession due to their housing bubble, tariffs, & their bear market doesn't help
2017 2018-10-10 17:54:24 Long term investors should always think of best advantage they can derive from the market.

In present scenario lots of stocks with sound fundamentals have fallen considerably.

Great opportunity to grab them!

2019 2018-10-10 17:53:47 i'm not telling anyone what to do. Like i said i made my money on this junk penny stock. Now i'm focusing on proven stocks that are in their infancy. 100% of quality or 1000% possible risk and losing all? sold on the junk and made money now focusing on the possible 100% quality:)

2035 2018-10-10 17:46:40 They probably were. Public humiliation works Some judges impose a variation on the stocks. Like, say if you stole mail, you stand outside the post office with a sign saying: "I stole mail. This is my punishment." A police officer ensures compliance.

2044 2018-10-10 17:43:10 whatever anyone thinks about Seann & Katya’s indiscretion, was it really necessary to publicly shame them on It Takes Two tonight? It felt like putting them in the stocks and was very uncomfortable to watch & unnecessary to broadcast

2052 2018-10-10 17:39:05 #US Stocks Slide
Wall Street traded sharply lower and was on track to record the biggest drop in months on Wednesday as the bond sell-off continues. Tech shares were among the worst performers. The Dow Jones was down 1.5%, the S&P 500 fell 1.5% and the Nasdaq traded 1.9% lower
2053 2018-10-10 17:38:56 But on a forreal note my stocks have straight up plummeted and it’s not fun 
2054 2018-10-10 17:38:24 they are paying people to sell stock- Powell is paying people to sell stocks
2055 2018-10-10 17:38:14 I have to say no to all China stocks... I lost too much already due to how toxic they are
2056 2018-10-10 17:38:06 Stocks; Interest rates & oil prices are rising.  Higher costs will cut into corporate profits.  So stocks in USA have been falling in the last week from record highs..  But we have a long way to go to match 19% decline in China & 8% decline in Europe stocks in last 6 months
2057 2018-10-10 17:36:30 This pullback is on massive volume. Looks like big money selling before earnings. Hard to justify buying stocks like $AAPL even on stellar EPS. Up $40 since last Q? Crazy. imo
2058 2018-10-10 17:36:28 Needs luck and good knowledge about the market. Stocks fluctuate a lot. and crypto currency isn’t an official currency yet, might die at some point.
2059 2018-10-10 17:35:07 I would add a detail to this.  There are some localities where fish are less safe to eat, but not because of radiation from Japan. Instead, local pollution, like the new USA proposal allowing ocean disposal of tracking wastewater, can impact the quality of fish stocks.

2063 2018-10-10 17:33:02 I think  increasing  the  ethanol level to 15% is  ok.    I also think  it should only be  implemented  when   carryover stocks  reach a  certain level..  and  is  reduced to  10%  when  surplus corn is used up.  The last thing we need is  8 dollar corn.
2064 2018-10-10 17:32:57 Saying that specific stocks are in a bear market has always been one of the dumbest things I've heard Wall Street people say.
2065 2018-10-10 17:31:55 When value stocks have staged a comeback, won’t they then become the new momentum trade, with the investment bandwagon simply rolling on but with different constituents? Or will value stocks’ day in the sun end too quickly for that to happen?

2074 2018-10-10 17:27:53 Seasonality: As previously mentioned, when one has been doing this for a while, one develops a healthy respect for the potential of a correction during Sept/Oct. During bear mkts, important bottoms are often put in then, e.g. '87, '90, '98, '02 #stocks

Last woosh was ignored by 3m $VIX curve; IG CDX is 2bps wider, or ≈ ½ as bad as stocks; only area that has seen worsening in last few sessions is HY cash spreads.
2085 2018-10-10 17:22:37 Worse than January 2016? That was pretty brutal. But the Chinese stocks weren't down 50% during that downturn so if anyone if in the Chinese stocks, it's even worse.
2086 2018-10-10 17:22:19 STOCK OPTIONS:  Executives were given stock option.  When their companies buy-back stocks, the price goes up.  Executives then exercise the option, sell the stock and make a boat-load of money.  The passive 401K investors typically get screwed when the stock price then declines.

2104 2018-10-10 17:17:22 it's just a chart tho, tbh I don't think it's worth the trouble and it seems unnecessary considering they'll only count sales from one site, it's probably just a way to boost their stocks

2112 2018-10-10 17:14:55 WSJ - U.S. stocks dropped sharply Wednesday as an ongoing surge in Treasury yields pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average down about 400 points and put the S&P 500 on pace for its longest losing streak in nearly two years.

2128 2018-10-10 17:10:21 At midday, Mortgage Bonds modestly lower. Stocks plunging. S&amp;P in midst of a five-day losing streak, longest in two years. 10-yr yield 3
2129 2018-10-10 17:09:59 This has been the hardest 3 days of my investing life.  Over three, what I though was sensible, investing years, I accumulated £220,000 of gains.  In three days 25% of that has disappeared.  I am mentally drained but I own good stocks and will not be selling.

2133 2018-10-10 17:08:11 The real @realDonaldTrump stock market is seeing the greatest selloff in years.  Sixty percent of S&P stocks are down more than ten percent.
2134 2018-10-10 17:07:46 oui mais tu ne mange pas que (ou pas du tout?) tes animaux... et les stocks de B12 sont énooormes, j'ai dû attendre 4 ans avant de devoir me complémenter et les symptômes de carences sont très longues à ressentir. Si tu n'as pas fait de test d'urine récemment tu peux pas savoir.
2135 2018-10-10 17:07:27 I'll bet, like the person who told you that their Secretary wasn't capable to make good decisions to pick stocks (you mentioned index funds for him), there are probably many who feel a warehouse worker doesn't need such.. just give them their 15, so they can blow it at wal Mart
2136 2018-10-10 17:07:10 There is no denying the fact that economic activity has slowed down worldwide.

2141 2018-10-10 17:06:03 Yeah fiber takes your body a lot longer to process so it keeps you full longer. That's why veggies like broccoli will make you full fast, because it has a lot of fiber (mostly in the stocks). Oatmeal or beans are common high fiber foods.
2142 2018-10-10 17:06:00 I wish you were right but don't hold your breath. Even if it proves true, the US won't budge -  they will 'condemn' and carry on with business. Oil. Weapons. Stocks.

2162 2018-10-10 17:01:29 A risk-off tone gripped financial markets, with U.S. stocks falling the most since June as the effects of the trade war hit corporate profits. Treasuries pared losses and the yen rose on demand for haven assets.

2193 2018-10-10 16:50:48 Concept is simple,traders buy stocks/options when the prospects look good & momentum is trending up.Short sellers buy puts or go short the physical stock when trouble is looming.Nobody out to get Tesla per se,it just happens to be a compny whom many think is in financial trouble
2194 2018-10-10 16:50:34 #Trump genius: look for him to hammer Powell on #stocks: “See I told you not to raise rates aggressively” By doing so he cleverly inoculated himself from lower stocks.  Bonus of political pressure on Powell. $es @opptrader1 @marcmakingsense
2195 2018-10-10 16:50:30 Could definitely see that. Retail panics and goes to cash while smart money buys the dip when stocks and crypto crash. Same happened with gold during the last recession. It initially dumped because people needed to pay the bills, then it pumped: fear of inflation and bank runs

2211 2018-10-10 16:45:23 I’ll tell you this much. I feel way better about buying crypto than I do stocks right now.

2212 2018-10-10 16:45:19 Graphite stocks will continue to surprise on upside...prices continue to inch up...with winter cuts it will exacerbate.....further new business entry like graphene, battery material supplier will   excite market
2213 2018-10-10 16:44:47 Stocks that stay flat on market-wide selloffs are ones that haven't yet significantly overshot fair value (as all stocks do). That's useful info for structuring portfolios with some wealth preservation, for scaling into and out of positions, for trading around cores, etc.

2216 2018-10-10 16:43:40 From watching the bonds they still follow the stock a little, so a sustained bounce could change that. But I'm not brave enough to be long Musk with all those issues.

2222 2018-10-10 16:41:27 Stocks Showing Substantial Move To The Downside - U.S. Commentary ...
2223 2018-10-10 16:41:26 U.S. stocks have been inflated by the cash from tax cuts; the companies were buying out own stocks which increased demand & caused prices to go up. The last step will be when executives offload their stocks at the peak & then everything will go down.
2224 2018-10-10 16:41:19 In the hunt for yield, these Dow stocks could be investors' best bets ...
2225 2018-10-10 16:41:02 I don't think humble people take big positions in battleground stocks.
2226 2018-10-10 16:40:43 @QuikWitted market had been in a bullish mode for over 10 years ... yields are rising ..money will move out of market or to defensive stocks

2235 2018-10-10 16:38:11 Also, folks should keep in mind that stocks Like AAPL tend to give in last on a truly ugly selloff, before we really bottom.
2236 2018-10-10 16:37:53 It’s irresponsible to run a headline across the screen “stocks collapsing” when they’re off 1.28% - maybe you’ve all gone out to lunch ?

2248 2018-10-10 16:34:31 the two most shorted stocks on the market are Amazon and Apple, respectively, which both make complete sense. But #3 is Qualcomm, which I really don't get. They're a big company, but surely someone like Facebook should be #3?
2249 2018-10-10 16:33:56 Because no one is turning profits. They want the best talent at bottom dollar with the allure of free stocks. If you spent 20 years getting to where you are, would you risk it for min wage to get a foot in? Nope sorry.

2257 2018-10-10 16:31:07 We have started a “proper” slide in stocks. Defensive and dividend names are up along with volatility.   So we should see some damage here.  How much?  Who knows?
2258 2018-10-10 16:31:00 In markets like this - nothing works and I am not talking about sophisticated traders with cute methods. I am talking of normal methods - people who want to buy stocks and make money by holding for some period of time
2259 2018-10-10 16:30:23 I just had a dream that I took 9 stocks in a crew battle. Then the person who’s setup we were playing on had to leave so we spent 30 mins looking for a setup with no bullshit on it. (Vanilla with UCF) and everyone only had 20xx with texture hacks and no UCF

2354 2018-10-10 16:08:34 #bitcoin wow #Dow is down 400 points while #cryptocurrencies have hardly moved. If you sell all your stocks, wait for stocks to bottom , then buy them back, you’ll make a fortune and.

2361 2018-10-10 16:07:42 The huge tax breaks given to Corporations have allowed them to buy back their own stock.  That keeps the stocks up.  Doesn't help paychecks or benefits to increase for workers in our country
2362 2018-10-10 16:07:37 Some people are selling and causing the fear emotion to spread across all market as well, this times are the right time to be buying some stocks (and have some capital on the side) at rock bottom prices instead of selling, but I know... Easy to say, hard to do.
2363 2018-10-10 16:07:36 Great day to go shopping. I got some $MSFT $BABA and $SLV . Order is in for some $VXX put spreads, we'll see if that gets filled at the price I want #options #stocks #stockmarket #investing #swingtrading

2382 2018-10-10 16:03:30 Today is a reminder. You should always have a good chunk of your portfolio in boring, defensive stocks that pay a strong dividend.

When you use word big tumble, I am thinking 10-15% drop. Stocks tend to move up and down 3-5 %.

2466 2018-10-10 15:46:35 Stocks need to drop so companies can buyback their cheap stocks.
2467 2018-10-10 15:46:33 I just made 10% gain over last few months. Of course stocks will go down at times, but understanding the nature of the game is what is important. Thats why self investing can be the better option: you can keep a closer eye on things and  are not paying anyone else fees.

- Stage 3: EM , stocks 
- Stage 4: Oil now , UST yields , US $ , EM stays , stocks stay 

Ranges to tighten. Realised volatility compressing?

2504 2018-10-10 15:40:43 I agree. For the past couple yrs, growth/high beta stocks have become way over owned and value stocks have become hated and value traps. So many frothy names so this decline is good, but all stocks get hit - even the ones that have not been overvalued
2505 2018-10-10 15:40:43 My guess is crypto will dump hard when stocks dump then pump. Initial shock of stocks dumping will drive people to cash.

2519 2018-10-10 15:38:31 Agree. The market has been full of momentum trades, buying stocks that were going up because they were going up.  A good way to make money as long as you never believe the story and just go with the flow.
2520 2018-10-10 15:38:21 The market is marginally up over the last month.  By the end of the day, it may be down.  Not to mention, the ‘market’ are 30 stocks.  The Dow is down today because tech is down.

2575 2018-10-10 15:28:02 Experts and managers all saying this is a minor stock market pull back. My thoughts are the sell off is timely just for the hedge funds to buy up low and end the year high.

2587 2018-10-10 15:25:26 The Dow falling 400 points is the Democratics/Soros/Rothschild and the Globalist manipulating the market. Most of the stocks that are down are the globalist stocks. They will take down anything to achieve their goal. They have no love for the people they hurt
2588 2018-10-10 15:25:24 Stocks and MBS are both down this morning on concerns over higher Yields.  DOW is now down over 400 and NASDAQ is down over 175.  MBS is down just 5bps.  Yields are hanging in at 3.21%, but was testing 3.25% earlier.
2589 2018-10-10 15:25:21 It’s a positive for anyone that has a retirement account that invest in stocks. I don’t know of anyone that has gotten a pay cut because of Trunps tax cuts. A bunch have gotten raises and I’m sure many more as the benefits of tax cuts are seen over the next few years.

Still...thanks for sharing!
2607 2018-10-10 15:22:16 Tim to be fair it is an idiotic question that you know the answer too. The market is ? prospects for growth stocks with moats&revenues&cash flows and further opportunities. A testament to this is how solid it is....time will tell how the cult of followers behave!!
2608 2018-10-10 15:21:30 A rise in £ might help many Stocks though like Retailers who source overseas. I suspect FTSE250 could hold up better than FTSE100. Whatever - it's what Charts say that matters.

2617 2018-10-10 15:19:03 I know you'll be surprised at this, but market/stocks go up, and they go down.  Nike was up 5% a couple weeks after announcement.  Down 10% since that time.  Not that much movement overall.
2618 2018-10-10 15:19:00 Have we went below 20% on stocks trading above 10 day? I can only find charts on 5 and 20 day.
2619 2018-10-10 15:18:51 Stocks just getting hammered in waves today, breaking below key technical supports in some index futures
2620 2018-10-10 15:18:37 Hypothesis: stocks most held by passives have held up better, as in equity land we have not seen outflows
2621 2018-10-10 15:18:34 All the FAANG stocks dropped 5% today and are down 10% for the week, a couple more days of this and we'll be looking at a correction larger than the one on February
2622 2018-10-10 15:18:32 Are we seeing the starting of a slowing down market? $sbux $amzn $bac $msft $dis $aapl $ba $xon $ko $mcd $mkc $cost $wmt $pg $goog are these stocks "recession proof" in your opinion?

2625 2018-10-10 15:17:49 $TSLA is down today due to overall market selloff,avg stocks down 4% to 5%,so today's drop is normal. Will go back to $300 once market is up
2626 2018-10-10 15:17:34 I am riding free shares and what makes you an expert to tell us when to buy and when to sell. You literally a rookie in stocks. RDGL was your first ever play 
2627 2018-10-10 15:17:32 What if all the FUD about a stock market crash... is a scam to get you to sell your stocks to the elite market whales?
2628 2018-10-10 15:17:29 Thanks.  That, and the way the largest medical insurance company stocks jumped 50% in the year following ACA passage.  The smart money saw the screws coming.
2629 2018-10-10 15:16:42 They don’t need to be filled. Stock can go other way. Gaps being filled is nothing new.  I recommend if interested you study technical analysis stocks.
2630 2018-10-10 15:15:54 How much do you think stocks will go down this cycle?

2636 2018-10-10 15:14:50 We get a reprieve in the upward movement in bonds and rates today!  Bonds are feeling pressure to move higher by over $50B in Treasury auctions today. There will be over $230B in total auctions this week.  bonds are getting some help from stocks moving lower.

2648 2018-10-10 15:11:33 Agree there is a lot getting pulled down at the moment, means it’s even more important to be positioned in fundamentally solid stocks with news catalysts approaching. AIM chart looks like it’s about to hit support at least, let’s see if there’s a bounce.

2683 2018-10-10 15:07:17 Today's painful across the board. I took great profits in $NIO this morning but sadly the rest of my portfolio is making up the dif in losses. Just trying to take solace that my port's net value is even. Holding the rest of these stocks knowing they're heading back up! Patience!
2684 2018-10-10 15:07:17 Analyst earnings expectations are too high for 2019, and as they cut their numbers the attractiveness of many, if not most stocks will decline. Plus yields are going up. Why own a stock with a 2% yield and economic risk when you can lock in an over 3% yield by buying a bond.

2712 2018-10-10 15:01:34 For anyone wondering: Just shorting doesn’t do much harm— you’re basically making a bet that stocks will drop in x amount of time. If it does, you make money. If not, you lose. A lot.

But actively getting in there and intentionally dicking stuff up is icky on so many levels.

2733 2018-10-10 14:55:49 With much respect. I still think that 3 of 4 stocks follows the Overall Market. That’s mean 75% 80% of the stocks has more trend to go down. Of course you have that 20% in the opposite direction but the odds are lower.

2750 2018-10-10 14:51:06 How a risk-off day looks when there's no strong Treasuries bid: 52-week high list shows a flight to Berkshire Hathaway, Verizon, the big spice company and seven utility stocks. 

Seems a catch-down move by the big indexes after weeks of sub-surface selling until proven otherwise.
2751 2018-10-10 14:50:37 #Stocks,#Indexes MISSED SPX TOP SIGNAL yesterday at 2880, charting it now at SPX=2851.  Likewise for the NDX recent "sub-criterion" top signal; NDX=7246.

2756 2018-10-10 14:49:44 Today’s market move is notable, not due to index stocks but due to the small/ mid caps. It has strengthened HNI/ retail balance sheets, to fight the bears. Also, proof that we had reached a point when there were no sellers  if you wanted to buy a reasonable amount. #Nifty #Sensex
2757 2018-10-10 14:49:24 Like Tesla stocks?
2758 2018-10-10 14:49:13 Investors, October is notorious. But the back-half of the month is often better than the first half, on average. Also, historically, October has been an excellent time to buy (don't rush, let $spy come to you). #stocks #money #investing

@profit_raining
2763 2018-10-10 14:48:08 Yes... better -but not all that good either. Best to exit stocks then wait until Bonds hit highs to buy them. This is the trick. Leave money in money-mrkt acct until safe to buy bonds or re-enter stocks. There are reverse-mrkt ETFs and ETNs that go up in down mrkt, but are tricky
2764 2018-10-10 14:47:48 I know. We have four kids. Unemployment is about $670 a week and groceries alone are about $400 weekly. Hence why we had to sell some stocks and drain our savings sadly. I’m sorry, it isn’t fair to any of us. But we have each other’s backs, and must stand together. Hang in there

2774 2018-10-10 14:45:20 I don't remember the name of the company I first opened an e-brokerage account to buy stocks with, but it wasn't E-trade, specifically because I didn't like how big e-trade was and their fee schedule. Years later Capital One Bought that company. Soon E-trade will buy Capital One.

2778 2018-10-10 14:44:23 Agreed! It's great. I don't think a drop in stocks is a correlation at all and vice versa. I do think crypto is stable right now though and will be on the upside.
2779 2018-10-10 14:44:21 LOL... You are silly. China is getting close to a recession, and we are long in the tooth for one

2790 2018-10-10 14:41:02 The behavioral science of both asset classes is paradoxical. Crypto investors are told to expect extreme volatility and high potential drawdowns, but stock investors are generally told that volatility and high drawdowns are not the norm, and stocks should just steadily rise...

2820 2018-10-10 14:35:52 Cannabis stocks are generally a scam from vulture capitalists that have nothing to do with cannabis but are trying to exploit naive investors. Want to invest in cannabis? Invest in a local legal small cannabis business directly.

2883 2018-10-10 14:20:42 Divy stocks, municipals, REITs, utilities, consumer staples often outperform as markets teeter. But in true bear markets everything gets taken out...for months.

2888 2018-10-10 14:19:00 $BTC look at the $SPX / $QQQ we are going to find out if $BTC is correlated or not and soon. Look at that $VIX chart.....fear ripping...its going higehr the $VIX...stocks are going lower ST here......where $BTC....Support $6400-6200 crucial.  Not advice.
2889 2018-10-10 14:18:48 That moment when @GerberKawasaki is revealed to be nothing more than a momentum chaser...ironically, just days after bashing the great @davidein for a performance shortfall thanks to avoiding/shorting those very same stocks. Pride before the fall, my friend.

2893 2018-10-10 14:18:10 $rdgl it does suck the shares will be converted to common shares.  But toxic debt is gone.  And let the holders of those shares dump them.  Once they do that they can only buy them back.  But this also allows $RDGL to reduce the OS to raise share price then those stocks are gone.
2894 2018-10-10 14:17:27 Stocks ar ok. Relax... remember when I tell you that the institutional investors move the market these one percentage points not the small guy so when the quarterly reports come out on earnings and this thing Rockets up. Nobody is going to care about interest rates. Wait and see

2898 2018-10-10 14:16:37 you have concluded on 29th august that our money should be on US Stocks and not on BITCOIN, do you stand by it ? Suddenly everything is interesting.
2899 2018-10-10 14:16:32 Top stick market analysts near Diwali last year picked 17 stocks for their respective channels. Most recommendations flopped & investors lost huge money as REGULATORS SLEEPING& no accountability of any one. Poor show ?

2902 2018-10-10 14:15:37 It looks pretty bad out there. But I think it's a great chance to buy some stocks on sale with ER season right around the corner!
2903 2018-10-10 14:15:26 @jimcramer You’ve been a cheerleader for Trump and this economy. You aren’t worried that Ford and GM are looking like companies that could be bankrupt in 2 years? Or that housing stocks are getting crushed. Or that China is going to force trump to push tariffs to 25%?
2904 2018-10-10 14:15:19 I would say it’s fear. This administration is directly targeting them with their rhetoric, making them fearful. I tell ya, somebody did their homework. I also see wealthy middle class were I am, think tRumps great since all their stocks went up.
2905 2018-10-10 14:14:24 In short, there are no market makers.   It's all through brokers
2906 2018-10-10 14:14:21 Stocks fall sharply as rates hold near multiyear highs; techs tumble hard
2907 2018-10-10 14:14:03 A bit of a stealth correction going on in stocks over the past few days. Broad indices are only down -2.5-4.0%, but the average S&P 500 stock is lower by over -14%. History shows, however, that more often than not those laggards re-converge to the index, not the other way around.
2908 2018-10-10 14:13:58 So now, to buy medication in our pharmacies you need USD,  public hospitals have no stocks, it's really a bad time to be sick, except you never choose when to be sick,  
Bt even in crisis, public health services should be buffered and prioritised @edmnangagwa @healthtimeszim
2909 2018-10-10 14:13:56 U.S. stocks opened broadly lower on Wednesday, as Treasury yields rose after data showed US producer prices climbed last month, suggesting there was no relief on inflation pressures.

2936 2018-10-10 14:08:01 Blood bath sell-off in markets, but financial stocks are once again holding up pretty well. Banks stocks such as $WFC, & $C are positive today, at least so far.

2947 2018-10-10 14:06:55 Just an observation but when looking at stocks across all sectors and individual etfs, this selloff appears scarier than the one in febuary, support zones are getting blasted with little, to no pause. Many etf's looking " bear market-y " if you will.
2948 2018-10-10 14:06:39 NASDAQ SPX500 DJ30 dropping like a stone as well as stocks. Xrp is the answer new currency is coming
2949 2018-10-10 14:06:30 Not at all. All this was a rumor that started about Icahn (Probably  eBay started it) to get the stocks pumped up a bit, so they could give themselves more pats on the back ()i.e thousands of shares), only to unload them at full profit. Just like Aug 15th

Market cap:

S&P 500  Growth ($13.2 trln)
S&P 500 Value ($11.2 trln)

So the index is tilted 54%-46% toward growth.

3264 2018-10-10 11:51:41 I bought Bodal on high rates and plan to do average (one shouldn't average stocks in down trend) around 110 as support on monthly chart. But will wait till December as to digest the election volatility.

3267 2018-10-10 11:50:40 for tradeable low on Dax we need higher volatility, calm and higher correlation betwen stocks preceding higher volatility and lower prices
3268 2018-10-10 11:50:15 Guessing market top & bottom is difficult,this is also applicable to individual stocks but better to invest if stock is available 15-20% lesser than its intrinsic value.

Bought few stocks yesterday up by 10-12% today,but don't know what will happen tomorrow.

3270 2018-10-10 11:49:22 FYI

Today, German 10-year bonds touched their highest level since May.

Should see this being reflected in European stocks and  too
3271 2018-10-10 11:48:52 This is getting into silly territory. Definitely not selling until into the 30's. £25m MC now!! If I had the cash I would be topping up big time, but unfortunately can't. Though I may sell other stocks if it goes much further as they should bounce hard at some point. #HMI
3272 2018-10-10 11:48:10 To make serious money till year end, stocks which respected July Lows or demonstrating 3X (in price terms) more strength than Nifty can be bought, also stocks which are not in BUY talk list in Social Media or rather in hate mode & laggards from 15-16-17 may Surprise on Upside.
3273 2018-10-10 11:47:50 We are still short across the board. $ES $ES_F buy stops will trigger if (and only if) $SPX cash index trades up through 2898. #PPI on deck. Watching to see if 10 yr bond can move down towards 3.15%. #Trading #stocks #Futures $TLT $ZN $TNX $ZB $TYX $NQ $NQ_F
3274 2018-10-10 11:47:22 All stocks are up today. Whats the big deal
3275 2018-10-10 11:47:22 cannot predict anything, people  said the same thing after upmove from mid july lows,   overall mkt still expensive many good stocks still over valued trading at 30-50 pe.
3276 2018-10-10 11:47:14 Well Martha Stewards comments on her stocks were her  opinions not facts and she went to prison. It is called lying to the FBI/lying under oath.  His roommates said he was LYING. He was misleading and denying what he did. What I meant was Fraternity/even at Stanford.
3277 2018-10-10 11:46:30 Will O'Bigot be secured in stocks on stage and do we have to bring our own rotten fruit and veg to throw at him?
3278 2018-10-10 11:44:45 @CNN the crazy mob mentality  believe u can't be civil 2 your fellow Americans just because you don't agree with Hillary on her issues IF YOU BELIEVE THIS THAN YOU JUST GO AHEAD & VOTE FOR DIMMS OR DEMOCRATS BECAUSE ONE DAY WHAT GOES AROUND WILL COME AROUND BUY USA STOCKS AMAZON

3290 2018-10-10 11:39:25 No. Es ridículo para ti (entendiendo ridículo como fácil) dar las "clases". Es como si a mi me pagaran por enseñar a pinchar, con la diferencia de que una mezcla es prácticamente imposible que me salga mal. Lo que tú enseñas, aún haciendo todo bien, pueden darte candela
3291 2018-10-10 11:38:58 Volatility generally increases when market is about to take u turn. Always be cautious when you see sudden rise or fall in stocks abruptly.
3292 2018-10-10 11:38:41 Every one saw the way the previous govt were handicapped and forced to lose the elections systematically.  The investor confidenc shattered,investors lost billions dollars in stocks. Rupee lost value due to foreign investors who withdrew their investments. Followed by inflation.

3314 2018-10-10 11:27:31 that this is celebrated by WS is comical and confusing.  Whatever makes equities rise is what matters.

3319 2018-10-10 11:23:03 I love your tweet, but instead of cutting out dairy we could consume organic dairy as the animals are raised in a limited amount rather than stocks, preventing excessive deforestation and land use.

3320 2018-10-10 11:22:01 Rather selective! It does make sense to hold some additional precautionary stocks of medicines, because, even if the risks of disruption are very low, the costs of getting it wrong are obviously very high. But I also gave the example of food, where its clearly unnecessary.

3378 2018-10-10 10:39:51 Hindsight always makes us realize that investing is easy. But we never try to understand that holding the stocks with conviction during the extreme drawdowns is excruciatingly hard.

3419 2018-10-10 09:58:48 A lot of buying/selling in the last few minutes before markets close may be linked to Regret Aversion Bias -

2. Sell now before the stocks open lower tomorrow!

3430 2018-10-10 09:46:56 But at least there are enough service sector jobs to keep the Unemployment Rate low, even though pay and benefits are shitty.  

And the stock market is doing well, even though roughly half of Americans don't own any stocks and 84% of value is held by the wealthiest 10%.
3431 2018-10-10 09:44:56 Haha. TA or for that matter any model or technique always only has historical data on their hands. GOK how much of selling and buying is on the cards for the day. And only that decides prices of all stocks n indices.
3432 2018-10-10 09:44:23 One thing that I've noticed over the last week is that stocks that are oversold are becoming more oversold, you have to take your stops.

3438 2018-10-10 09:32:34 It is better to invest in stocks and shares, rather than in cash, at the moment, owing to low interest rates.
3439 2018-10-10 09:31:44 S&P500 is still trading near highs....just pulled back less than 2%. But the broader market and few sectors like Tech/Semiconductor stocks have seen a meaningful pullback over the last 4-6 weeks. 
Headline numbers can be deceptive
3440 2018-10-10 09:31:17 Hong Kong stocks edged narrowly higher on Wednesday, halting a six-day losing streak as they endured lingering concerns over Sino-American trade relations and global growth.

3447 2018-10-10 09:21:19 People still dont learn. Crypto and stocks tend to have a positive correlation, when stocks dump why should people move their money to an even riskier asset?
3448 2018-10-10 09:20:31 That is because they mostly buy on tips and advise of other ppl. They have zero knowledge of what they are buying and end up with poor quality companies and feel if they hold on too these pathetic stocks they will be able to exit in the next bull market which never happens

3485 2018-10-10 08:38:56 @SharePickers Justin, people are talking about we're in an AIM bear market? Has this happened before? If so how long do can they last? Certainly lots of good stocks on the drop at the moment!

3502 2018-10-10 08:19:53 Hmm. I don't see why. Trump's decision to ban bump stocks shocked everyone and took away the momentum.
3503 2018-10-10 08:18:52 Probably from French fishermen who are protecting their beds from British boats & building stocks, if you recall the stories a few weks ago. There's probably room for the Irish to expand too, where their coast is similar.

3505 2018-10-10 08:17:37 La banca e' tua amica, quindi. Quando gli investimenti fatti dalla banca vanno bene immagino tu ti senta piu' ricco. Ma i manager della banca in quel caso i premi e le stocks se li godono soltanto loro.
Nell'ottica del risparmiatore le oscillazioni dei Btp sono ininfluenti.

3511 2018-10-10 08:06:55 Hi Di - interesting point about Growth and Value Stocks - I think you're right, Growth stuff has definitely come off the boil. It's perhaps not that Value stuff is doing well but just isn't falling as much cos a lot priced in !! p

3514 2018-10-10 08:06:20 Person with fewer stocks lost at the end of 4 minutes wins.
3515 2018-10-10 08:05:51 I would get behind this format.  Aesthetically, I think it would be better to simply count the number of stocks lost instead of counting down from 99 though.
3516 2018-10-10 08:03:01 Housing is just a fraction of former levels even before rate hikes started. At 2018 peek our best housing data is below last cycle and every cycle befoer that. A lot of stuff never recovered. GDP is 1/2 of ;last cycle. Only thing booming was stocks.

3698 2018-10-10 05:34:06 I agree entirely! I'm all in favor of people being able to exist in public spheres openly and without labels. That doesn't stop them from existing though-if I go shopping with my boyfriend, I shouldn't have to fear being refused service at a convenience store, for living my life.
3699 2018-10-10 05:33:42 I would be under the same obligations-I've opened my doors to the public, I must serve the public. If I don't want to serve a thing, I won't stock it.

3751 2018-10-10 05:02:28 Stocks on major world markets edged lower on Tuesday, with a decline in the materials sector offsetting rising energy shares, while long-dated U.S. Treasury yields pulled back from multi-year highs and helped weaken the U.S. dollar.
3752 2018-10-10 05:02:10 Just received a hefty re-stock from the fine folks at Evil Hat Games! So if that sounds like just the ticket, get on in and snap 'em up while you can! Stocks are limited!

3753 2018-10-10 05:01:54 Not that other sectors are clean. Just this sector is worst, shadiest of all. Reason for tweet is stocks had fallen, people may buy them without thinking other side. If someone is brave in being shady business, they can try. Yeah, they may generate wealth, just I'm not trusting.

3757 2018-10-10 04:59:43 This is the question that ALL workers and the conservatives must ask, esp. in the US. If companies are badly hurting financially and froze wages, , starting at the recession, HOW can they afford the large bonuses, stocks and pay increases to the CEO's and board members?
3758 2018-10-10 04:58:49 Nobody is shaming anyone here, just pointing out that the stuff that makes up most of your net worth fluctuates in value like crazy. Imagine $500K in stocks. Drops 1% in a day, you’re down $5K.

3764 2018-10-10 04:54:57 I followed their advice on two “buy now” stocks and watched both drop within two weeks; one 15% and 2 the other 20%.  I think they were shorting the stocks but can’t prove it.  Thankfully these were two  low value trades, but never again.

3776 2018-10-10 04:47:22 1 option: you could plonk down a thousand bucks and buy The Thoughtful Investor. read the book with his tweets since some concepts may be dated. But you still have to research and pick your own stocks. never held the stocks recommended by @BMTheEquityDesk still it was worthwhile
3777 2018-10-10 04:47:07 Yes thank u YES!!! People dont understand crypto’s are NOT stocks u can not calculate value through supply!!!! Please guys DYOR!!
3778 2018-10-10 04:47:00 Tough to say without knowing insider info. This bet today was 5k contracts, pretty big in size. I don’t like shorting stocks/going against the market so this isn’t my kind of jam. Will be interesting to see any more bets placed by end of the week.
3779 2018-10-10 04:46:39 anyone who has been around for a long time, knows that .10 is possible, but it is highly unlikely. theres always a few stocks a year that explode 100x or even 500x. tjis thing has a low float, huge volume, 52 week high, and its market cap is tiny. we will find out

3788 2018-10-10 04:40:54 I don't follow. A market cap weighted index by definition is overweight large stocks no ? Agree that the market cap of those companies going up is an active managers thing. But an equal weighted index would see a drop from the non faang stocks dropping more than the S&P 500 does.

3792 2018-10-10 04:40:27 @Analyeast I disagree about @BMTheEquityDesk . those who were part of The Equity Desk 10 yrs ago and even track his arguments on social media will emerge with good portfolios. Cloning stocks picks of anyone should be avoided. learning their thought process is more important

3795 2018-10-10 04:39:12 Way more emphasis on timer, people'd start camping way harder, people would just focus on having more stocks, even if by a little bit. it'd take away the sort of beauty of melee that is "to beat me, you have to take my last stock, not just my first 3"
3796 2018-10-10 04:39:07 Yeah more or less what zuppy said. If you’re unable to win a game by virtue of taking all the stocks and there’s a guaranteed timeout you’d see a sharp decline in neutral interactions.

3870 2018-10-10 03:51:50 Yeah unfortunately it is a pay wall. However, that wasn't the real point. The point was Adam Feuerstein likes $AMRN, which is a good thing.  If you don't know Adam, he's been doing this a long time and can spot good vs fake biotech companies. His tweets can sometimes move stocks.

3932 2018-10-10 03:08:43 Very logical but as per my calculations the F&O margin calls may not be more then 2000 crore for this fall. There is higher chance that pledged stocks were liquidated to meet margin calls as many use such pledged margin.

3942 2018-10-10 03:03:00 FAANG and pot stocks are the most crowded trades right now. I like your proactive approach and will attempt to make a laundry list for you on the latter.
3943 2018-10-10 03:02:58 So their focus is on behavior. 
1. There is no wisdom in crowds.

4. People over-diversify
5. $ not for basic needs can stay 100% stocks

3955 2018-10-10 02:58:01 Most of the time what you call hoarding wealth is actually them tying their assets up in stocks and bonds, which does help people in a very roundabout way. If they were just sitting on their wealth I'd agree with you but you'd have to provide specific examples.
3956 2018-10-10 02:57:39 I ran the numbers. A conservative mix of stocks and bonds should easily produce a 5% return. Add in the advantage of tax free compounding. Leaving as much money as possible working as long as possible far out paces the uber safe approach.

The attempt of a buy & hold investor should be to find a few ideas, which can be held for an extended period of time so that they give 7-8X type of returns.

Many stocks give sudden spurts of growth & then fizzle out.

4102 2018-10-10 01:17:42 Sir Good Morning. 52 week high/low of nifty 11760.20-9831.05. if stocks can kiss high and low in the same way nifty has it's right to do so. we follow the trend for profit and unfollow the trend for losses. Request views before expiry will nifty 9831.05?
4103 2018-10-10 01:17:13 @Travis1992 I’d recommend playing big board stocks like AAPL or NFLX. The small penny stocks or small caps too volatile and harder to make $
4104 2018-10-10 01:15:43 So why not take the, basically, “free” allocation from Vanguard and others?  Use world allocation percentages of stocks (60 US / 40 Int’l). Add bonds as a risk management piece, higher % for those that can’t stomach drawdowns.
4105 2018-10-10 01:15:31 Yeah all stocks when down. JYP hit the hardest.

4113 2018-10-10 01:11:23 HK based Nine Dragons increasing supply was today's catalyst for U.S. & Cdn paper/forest company stocks to be down >5%, and then BMO downgrade.
4114 2018-10-10 01:10:31 Market internals are certainly showing darker hues lately. On the Nasdaq, falling stocks topped winners by just a slim margin, roughly 8-to-7. However, the Nasdaq's advance-decline line has now sloped lower for more than five weeks in a row. IBD Big Picture

4116 2018-10-10 01:08:53 Name one Federal “over regulation”.  Bluefin stocks are down to a fraction of what they were just 40 years ago.  Deregulation would decimate the population.  Clean air, clean water, carbon, toxic pollution, worker safety, child labor, the list goes on.  It’s not all 4 profit.
4117 2018-10-10 01:08:27 about to start investing in stocks
4118 2018-10-10 01:08:02 Some people don't know that stocks sometimes count toward income and will mess up your taxes, make sure to prepare.

4121 2018-10-10 01:03:55 Howard, you're the guy that buys stocks at their 52 week highs, because you know that in a bull market they will go higher. Tencent totally breaks your own rules. There are easier stocks out there.
4122 2018-10-10 01:03:07 I am so clueless when it comes to stocks
4123 2018-10-10 01:01:57 We prefer the stocks at midday
4124 2018-10-10 01:00:02 Both of them need to be locked up and put away for the crimes that they did. If we the people did anything like that they would have locked us up, thrown away the key & fed us only once a day.  So since that isn't going to happen this is the next best thing their laughing stocks!
4125 2018-10-10 00:59:34 It was 10 years not 1.  I also cited many authors.  All the data is on my side.  Bernstein proved over 20 years ago that monkeys throwing darts a board of stocks could pick better than the best stock pickers.  I absolutely take issue with him giving hot picks to naive investors.

4127 2018-10-10 00:58:25 $SPY Several stocks been battered up and when they reverse, could move quickly due to sellers that wanted to sell have sold. Are you ready?
4128 2018-10-10 00:58:24 Her stocks taking a dip 
4129 2018-10-10 00:58:01 Why would I want another perspective. Bonds continue to sell off and stocks still are hovering near all time highs. The money will continue out of the bond market into the stock market. A crisis/recession will lead everyone into gold when stocks collapse. Not there quite yet.
4130 2018-10-10 00:57:35 They wanna pay $20M for the Rock to be Champ in Saudi Arabia

Also, they're dumb af, bc their stocks are high now, and they think its a good sign, until they start hemorrhaging money.

The dominos will fall, trust me
4131 2018-10-10 00:57:11 stocks are going lower still, this might be it
4132 2018-10-10 00:56:37 What advise do you want Akshay? On stocks or mutual funds?
4133 2018-10-10 00:55:43 Yeah, all the money that our 401k and stocks are making us is so bad for our country and hurting us all. #DramaQueen
4134 2018-10-10 00:55:38 Idk why we aren’t investing in stocks for soap companies. The industry  must be booming with all of these soap cutting videos.
4135 2018-10-10 00:55:24 Today, I talked to a lifetime NRA member who describes himself as a 2A voter. 

He owns *a lot* of guns.

During our conversation, he uttered the words "I think we should have some common sense gun laws" like closing the gun show loophole & banning bump stocks.
4136 2018-10-10 00:54:37 Some financial advice to my fellow pot heads, if you haven't looked into investing into cannabis stocks just know you're missing out
4137 2018-10-10 00:54:11 My company offers stocks as a way to pay for bonuses, merit rewards, holiday extras, etc. When they're given as bonuses they're "restricted stock units" that have to vest before I can use them.

It's so weird to see so much money waiting to exist. It's like real... but not?
4138 2018-10-10 00:53:31 #Midcap 100 down 24%, #Smallcap 100 down 38%. Except some selective stocks, market still quite expensive on relative valuation basis.
4139 2018-10-10 00:52:34 Precisely. 
But if Russians were swimming across the Rio Grande, Democrats would be out there with pump stocks.
4140 2018-10-10 00:50:51 Convicts aren't slaves. Slaves don't go to jail. Wall Street stopped trading slaves 100 years before the Civil War and didn't start trading stocks, what Wall Street is synonymous with, till after the Civil War.
4141 2018-10-10 00:50:00 I'm glad for you and am also glad, I wasn't holding many stocks in the S&P 500 during this 5 day sell off that I don't think we've seen the worst of yet as dept accumulates, interest rates rise and the dollar prepares to plummet.

4143 2018-10-10 00:47:08 What are the movement's goals? I mean, obviously economic sanctions, increase the "Seattle Tax", and divestment of Starbucks stocks, but... Did you go to the latest meeting?
4144 2018-10-10 00:46:59 Correction coming in U.S. stock market. Stocks are overvalued. Never go up continuously without losing 10% (maybe 20+%) eventually. 

Don't rely on stocks this coming year. Starting now.
4145 2018-10-10 00:43:41 You realize you said “ONLY ONE” than listed 10 stocks right?
4146 2018-10-10 00:43:41 apple stocks rise by 35%.

4148 2018-10-10 00:41:03 Nothing of value?  Lower taxes, less regulations, manufacturing coming back, new USMCA deal, out of Iran deal, 3.7 unemployment, higher stocks, $ to military, $ to vet care, lower cost of WH staff, etc., etc.  Sad that you don't know how to read the accomplishments.

4150 2018-10-10 00:40:47 What prices did you buy these stocks? Why didn’t you do any trading?

4155 2018-10-10 00:36:52 OMFG

These people must just love becoming laughing stocks
4156 2018-10-10 00:36:44 Yeah the rhino Republicans that are fighting POTUS also. Trump is keeping his promises and is actually getting this country back on track and becoming#1 again. Just look at all the stats from stocks, economy, unemployment, trade taxes, security.
4157 2018-10-10 00:36:03 Do you have any idea where all the volume in the stocks comes from these days? Amd average daily volume is 11% of the float!
4158 2018-10-10 00:34:05 Just don’t buy the junk stocks. Lol

4162 2018-10-10 00:32:56 Blackpink rising YG stocks is no shock to anyone, but people get upset when we say he needs to promote them more but it’s true. They’re his money makers which is why it doesn’t make any sense to me why he keeps them locked away like that. Dumbass.
4163 2018-10-10 00:31:33 Stocks and bonds.
4164 2018-10-10 00:31:21 Don’t you Democrats hate unemployment at a 49 year low. If you take back the house in November be sure to dump your stocks fast.
4165 2018-10-10 00:31:04 As well as tmrw with a committee meeting. Pretty optimistic. I’ve been trading pharmaceutical stocks along with cannabis stocks lately. Overall steady increase.

4167 2018-10-10 00:30:15 Let’s ask it this way... Is there anything that you see that will stop the continued aggregation of assets... including private sector assets such as stocks and private sector debt...by central banks such as the ECB, BOJ and SNB?
4168 2018-10-10 00:26:25 European stocks rose on Tuesday despite ongoing tensions over Rome's budget spending plans. @LouisVuitton gained 1.4%, @Merck added 1.0%, @Commerzbank firmed 1.2% and @Tesco jumped 2.5%.
4169 2018-10-10 00:25:41 I also believe the dollar rises to new highs after this next dip BUT I believe it contributes to the coming #crash in stocks. Whether it is before or after the #Midterms remains to be seen but if it is before the next FOMC, the #Fed is done hiking and cutting next.
4170 2018-10-10 00:22:38 US stocks mostly fell on Tuesday after volatile session as investors continued to fret over implications of higher bond yields on equities amid concerns about the outlook for interest rates after International Monetary Fund lowered its forecast for US and China economic growth.
4171 2018-10-10 00:20:47 Obviously some stocks continue to rise to new highs. But not every day. Just saying that the information in this chart may not be giving you the information you think it is.

4174 2018-10-10 00:18:23 Is there a real need for bump stocks other than to kill people?  Not good for hunting or self defense. Didn't even the nra get behind banning those?

4178 2018-10-10 00:17:04 I get the argument of assault rifle versus normal semi-automatic. Mass shooters overwhelmingly pick assault rifle style guns, but if they weren't available they'd just switch to regular semi-auto. Bump stocks seem different to me though. Increased the kills dramatically in Vegas

4181 2018-10-10 00:13:38 Be careful buying stocks 10 other people own the same stock.
You only have a claim on the stock.
4182 2018-10-10 00:11:03 One problem with buying-the-dip in individual names is that you're automatically getting those stocks that didn't hold up will compared to other stocks.
4183 2018-10-10 00:10:57 How many stocks in total for Top 8 were taken by wobbling? What about Top 64? Is it truly a crutch? Can IC’s develop hand off combos that are just as successful, albeit way more difficult? 

Remove emotion. I hate wobbling as much as the next person but we look at it like Ness
4184 2018-10-10 00:10:33 Why even have these distinctions at all? Why do we need to draw a line between "necessary for living in society" and "only straight people have unfettered access to these things"? Shouldn't the public marketplace be open to *everyone*?
