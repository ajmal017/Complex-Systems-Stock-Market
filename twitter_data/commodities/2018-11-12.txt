40 2018-11-12 22:15:49 Bit far-fetched to group it with all other commodities China imported as the worlds production powerhouse. Gold functions mainly as a SOV. Sure it can go down more, but with the massive amounts of risk out in the market 400$ seems very unlikely.
41 2018-11-12 22:11:54 Yes he said that.
It's in is autobiograph book...
Sadly, he owns AMERICA. Literally his finger and pon players are in every aspect of human life-mostly foods-commodities, oil, technology and healthcare.
42 2018-11-12 22:08:46 @TomRusso do you think his belief that commodities are more profitable is true even today?
43 2018-11-12 22:04:40 Hey Nick, I see you're an ag trader. I considered putting ag commodities in the poll, bc Jim Rogers has been telling me they're cheap for the last 5yrs, what's your view?
44 2018-11-12 21:53:03 La soja es un commodities, no tienen mucho margen, con un impuesto o falta del mismo ppdes promover o anular un rubro asi, aparte de recaudar.
45 2018-11-12 21:52:29 For heaven's sake, here you go again. The USD is at a 17mth high. 40% of S&P500 earnings are generated from outside the US. It is highly unlikely that a stronger $ would not affect US markets. Plus commodities & precious metals are priced in USD- hence stronger $, prices drop.
46 2018-11-12 21:52:11 China tem se sustentado em impedir que os outros países dos BRICS agreguem valor a commodities. Bolsonaro tem sim que cortar esses caras, porque Russia e Índia vão imitar a gente na hora.
47 2018-11-12 21:51:38 Back in the day, welfare recipients got commodities. Cheese, rice, beans etc. Candy and other junk food should not be on the list of foods that are food stamp eligible. there should be accountability that the stamps are used for food and not sold for cash.
48 2018-11-12 21:51:13 How much of the rest is timber, and other resources?  My exposure has (admittedly) only been to the oil business up there.  I generally have a high opinion of Canadians' thoughtfulness, but they are unduly dependent on non-renewable commodities.

50 2018-11-12 21:49:55 Oil & Gas among the worst areas today along with semiconductors and biotech.  All done around 4-5%.

52 2018-11-12 21:41:05 Yep. There's a lot of that about in general now; people are becoming commodities in an increasingly consumerist world. It's a difficult thing to reverse, devaluation of life.
53 2018-11-12 21:38:05 Well China is a quiet big importers of oil; NATGAS; coal (yeah you heard that right); materiel; every single Ag commodities on planet; even they need an international market access.
They will try to become self reliant but they will fail.
54 2018-11-12 21:36:17 Commodities are the opium of the people.
55 2018-11-12 21:32:18 What might be going up in value? Stocks, commodities? Is RE going up? Gold? Labor?

57 2018-11-12 21:16:05 the way people put others up on pedestals is very... pervasive and highly concerning tbh. I didn't realise it back when I was deep in the kpop fandom, but when I got out, I realised that they way they're marketed made me see these people as commodities/not really human
58 2018-11-12 21:15:29 Land and resources are also commodities, not only population. Those unimportant states provide much of the oil and natural gas, much of the water for California, much of the farmland, almost all of the coal (when that was more important)...etc.
59 2018-11-12 21:15:25 human souls are soul-scalped and put in jars and sold in the alien black market between the demons, because the human soul and human DNA are the most valuable commodities among the nephilim alien demons. The human soul made in the image of God fascinates the demons and fallen
60 2018-11-12 21:11:55 All of the above are Commodities

62 2018-11-12 21:06:39 How it really works is the capitalist invests $ to buy labor who makes commodities to then sell for profit $.

M->C->M

A worker sells his/her labor to make $ to buy commodities & needs

C->M->C

That's the key difference. Don't work for them you have the "freedom" to starve.
63 2018-11-12 21:06:23 She already understands that basic commodities should be held in common, thus negating the need for private property. I bet she’s ready to understand why the clerk should be paid for her labor, rather than via the subjective system of supply and demand.
64 2018-11-12 21:04:48 Correct me if I am wrong, but doesn't the fact that a judge deemed all cryptocurrencies as "commodities" alleviate the need to file with the SEC, and now nullify **ALL** current cases against Ripple?

67 2018-11-12 20:53:02 Yeah, $USO / $CL_F is probably undervalued and $UNG overvalued but, commodities love to trend, and trend.  So, safer to wait for confirmation or extreme levels to size in.

77 2018-11-12 20:15:23 Interestingly enough most observers and PM enthusiasts consider 2001-2011 a complete bull cycle for gold. But that is obviously false, as Gold underperformed oil and commodities during the first 8 years. The actual bull market started after 2008 and has mostly gone unnoticed.
78 2018-11-12 20:08:24 What was d price of those commodities before Goodluck took over?  Ask ursef. Babangida and Abacha are d worse president we have in d history of this county,  what was d price of those commodities Wen they were ruling?
79 2018-11-12 20:00:06 We ordinary people don't understand your theories & figures. We r interested in ease of living rather than doing business.

80 2018-11-12 19:54:02 Mark, you've set yourself up as perceiving people who come from outside of the EU to be "cheap labour" who are going to "flood" the market following Brexit. You don't get to tell other people if they went too far, when you yourself seem to treat people as commodities.
81 2018-11-12 19:46:19 With traditional securities and commodities exchanges, a lot of the focus of traders is buying low, selling high, and eeking out profit market fluctuations. We're more interested in spurring the creation of new value by giving #buidlers a way to connect buyers and sellers.
82 2018-11-12 19:37:56 There are some commodities for which delivery time is not of much concern but cost is. And slowly and steadily time taken will also reduce.
83 2018-11-12 19:36:33 Oil is a commodity set by the market. Investors and speculators affect the price not your tweets. If supply is high and the costs are high, then blame the investors. Are you sure you're smart? You keep saying that but a lack of basic understanding of commodities says otherwise.
84 2018-11-12 19:34:55 Cool story. But California outproduces every state in the US - including Iowa - in food commodities.
85 2018-11-12 19:33:35 Chattel slavery is so named because people are treated as the chattel (personal property) of the owner & are bought & sold as commodities.

90 2018-11-12 19:21:09 Prices of rice have bit relaxed lately but inflation on major commodities remained. Higher unemployment figured in the last quarter this year, a research stated. Unlike yuletide celebrations before, this year is bit quiet, specially in suburbs where political strife impedes hope.
91 2018-11-12 19:15:12 I couldn't disagree more. There is plenty of room for different blockchains that solve different challenges. Bank remittances, supply chain management, investment vehicles, commodities trading, cash replacement, global forex platforms, etc.
92 2018-11-12 19:05:07 @ZBCNewsonline days supply and prices of commodities are now normalizing.  Supplies, I agree but for prices, may they please share with us the names and locations of these shops.

96 2018-11-12 18:48:06 Concordo. O q temos de pratico eh Tesouro IPCA + 5 a 6% até 2050 e não há evidência que a RV no Brasil bata este retorno principalmente sem setor tecnológico forte como no S&P.

154 2018-11-12 14:12:24 I would say completely the opposite now. Most farmers use their accounts to hedge or trade options.

Obviously there are still some out there using it to trade other commodities or something like that, but to say that's the majority would be false imo
155 2018-11-12 14:09:19 I disagree with that. Data for silver is nowhere as clear cut as with oil or some other commodities. Silver has been in a bear market for years and to say that there is a deficit seems quite misguided.

183 2018-11-12 11:24:26 How? China is already buying oil in  CNY/Gold. And expanding it to other commodities. And what if Chinese exporters tell buyers to settle in CNY? Outside of the US, the trade balance of China with RoW is fairly balanced
184 2018-11-12 11:18:01 Gold and silver, like other commodities, have an intrinsic value, which is not arbitrary, but is dependent on their scarcity, the quantity of labour bestowed in procuring them, and the value of the capital employed in the mines which produce them. David Ricardo
185 2018-11-12 11:07:10 No one ever talks about the tyranny of corporations. I like governments who protect us from greedy gun manufacturers and healthcare providers who take our right to life as commodities to be bartered for profit.
186 2018-11-12 11:04:49 China just needs to dump all UST, and put a quota of zero on rare earth exports. Oh, also stop buying anything the US has to sell, and direct all imports elsewhere (guess who benefits). And demand all those who want to sell commodities to China to settle in CNY.

Not only because farmers and cooperatives are key partners that will grow and scale, but how FMCG companies and downstream consumers care how their products, coffee, cocoa, nuts, rice are sourced.
229 2018-11-12 06:24:46 Absolutely not.  We are a mockery around the world because of this imbecile and his behavior with our commodities judicial system government and overseas self-interests. so no absolutely not stop it already you're sounding a fool

231 2018-11-12 06:20:56 Let's revisit this statement: "...Rep tax cuts reigned in Govt caused price inflation..." I do not quite see how these tax cuts did this and what the fed did to cause inflation. what prices are inflated? consumer goods? commodities? currency? I'll play nice if you do.

234 2018-11-12 05:46:46 Economics only shows up when people share enough values to agree that some scarce thing is valuable, and can't (or won't) kill each other for it.

In the modern day, we tend to move violence to the periphery of globalized trade, where commodities first get tokenized.

254 2018-11-12 02:57:55 Thinking out loud: This is a new asset class and we have no idea what will affect price. It's like a commodity in terms of speculation and utility. Like other commodities, the price is most heavily influenced by supply and demand. A price of .01 cent and $589 are both possible.
255 2018-11-12 02:32:13 Okay, si. Entonces un gobierno podría reducir a cero la pobreza en un mes (y por un mes solamente). Es como crecer por ganancias de productividad y por cambios en precios de commodities. Son love mismo pero solo en la superficie.
256 2018-11-12 02:28:31 The domestic consumption basket has a lot of housing and healthcare, the international consumption basket has commodities and capital goods. One of the most important things about rising US domestic energy production is it closed the gap between the two consumption baskets.
257 2018-11-12 02:26:13 That's just wrong. Those who own real assets or their residual value - like equity in private and public companies, real estate, commodities - will continue calling the shots regardless of BTC or fiat. Debt has tendency to become worthless - I agree there

265 2018-11-12 01:41:00 China's non-commodities goods trade surplus is ~$700B (IIF).  If China can print CNY for oil, other commodities (37m bbls of OI for Dec oil contract), then BoP/minimum adequate reserves are irrelevant on any near-/intermediate-term time horizon.  Why CNY oil contract so critical.
266 2018-11-12 01:33:33 That’s what the gold is for.  CNY falls as more commodities priced in CNY, but then CNY recycled into Chinese goods & net into Chinese govt bonds & gold.  But only UK/US gold

272 2018-11-12 00:47:57 You have it backwards America has been exploiting them for decades. The cost of paying decent wages will cripple the farming industry and would probably shut down production on some commodities which will then affect trucking, food processing, produce retail, restaurants etc
