6 2018-09-13 23:53:58 Stocks are correlated with corporate profits, not debt.  

The U.S. can take on more debt because the economy is growing, similar to a person being able to take on more debt because their income is rising.
7 2018-09-13 23:53:58 Missed this one. I'm thinking this Twitter is easier to follow on a computer... Obysmal gave us Romneycare. A corporate handout (hand-job?) to the insurance industry. When stocks skyrocket, it ain't socialism.

37 2018-09-13 23:49:38 can I have your thoughts on some stocks?
#MindReader
38 2018-09-13 23:49:26 I could ask you the same. When Trump was elected we were told the stock market would never recover. We were told people will die, we were told all kinds of nonsense from you fools. Instead, stocks up, jobs up, pays up, general consensus among business owners, highest ever.
39 2018-09-13 23:48:36 Had time to trade a few stocks today  made a cpl hundred.#not bad for a half hour
40 2018-09-13 23:47:59 You think you put 100 mil into these stocks with no slippage?
41 2018-09-13 23:47:25 The hell CUBE? I just off my phone for a while and suddenly their withdrawal is not final? 

Why would you do that huh? 

Owh...
...
Maybe cause you knew you're fcked without Hyuna and EDawn 

*cough cough* stocks prices *cough*
42 2018-09-13 23:46:53 Airlines are a great example, but they more came out of forever zombie land. I’m still waiting for oil/energy stocks to have a revival after being left for dead...that’ll hopefully be my answer in a year.
43 2018-09-13 23:46:44 So Cruz and aides are stockpiling illegal bullets? Like hollow point, silencers, bump stocks? not a gun person but I can just imagine what NRA has given him!
44 2018-09-13 23:46:19 the obvious mistake was not to snort coke which would have made his stocks rise like mad.
45 2018-09-13 23:46:04 TBH, yikes. hyuna and edawn deserve much better than that and cube kicked them out for simply being in love, and then reconsidering kicking them out because stocks when down LMFAOOO hyuna could carry cube ent on her back
46 2018-09-13 23:45:05 stan twitter thinks they know everything about stocks but they really don't because they naive and ignorant af
47 2018-09-13 23:44:37 Honestly really soyed (hahaha geddit) that the health food store only stocks one kind of canned corn....the kind that's loaded with added sugar 
48 2018-09-13 23:42:04 Bc it's not gonna grow rn, it'll be good in the future when more people have electric stocks
49 2018-09-13 23:41:43 Im going to start posting stocks to buy...
Been working hard researching and paid off today with (NIO) stock.  
Up 100% in todays buy, and it feels good to win for once!
50 2018-09-13 23:38:30 There are stocks which make no money currently because of market cycle but have a good book value. Some even have a market value lower than the book value.
51 2018-09-13 23:37:47 You see?  @cubeunited  Your Stocks got decrease??  Go on removed Hyuna and E'dawn on your Company!  And that's will be your last day with your company stock
52 2018-09-13 23:36:57 Cube realized their mistake after their stocks plummeted
53 2018-09-13 23:36:14 Irrelevant 'news'. Stocks follow patterns unless there's news. There hasn't been Nike news for 10 days or w/e. The test will come in January when they report.
54 2018-09-13 23:35:24 A ban for investors in the pot sector?? Wtf... I don’t smoke weed but invested in pot stocks... am I inadmissible??

56 2018-09-13 23:34:57 It the market trends up & they don't believe in trying to time it. They would be better off remianing nearer to fully invested in whatever they see as closest to value. You are after all paying them a fee to invest in stocks. Yes it is a consequence of price rather than action.
57 2018-09-13 23:34:14 What’s wrong with stocks ? Don’t like people making money?  
58 2018-09-13 23:33:41 U.S stocks gained overnight, #CPI sent #USD lower to risk, #Oil failed to hold it's comeback as #OPEC and #IEA comments maintained seller resolve.

59 2018-09-13 23:33:34 Did you get in on this weed stocks hype? If so have you bailed from it for a thicc gain?
60 2018-09-13 23:32:00 Thats great you're getting rich off of the stock market.  Here in the states, its mostly just the 10% of citizens who own 84% of all stocks.
61 2018-09-13 23:31:48 As usual with a lot of these guys, pretty ugly fundamentals and earnings.  I like the dip buy opp close to 52 week highs.  Looks like Phase 2 results being reported at ASBMR on September 30, it's hard to tell.  As a rule, I don't prefer 52 week highs before reporting Phase 2
62 2018-09-13 23:31:44 Depends on the market. In nerd stock, I'm class A. Everywhere else, I'm penny stocks.
63 2018-09-13 23:31:19 Teach me how to play with stocks and bonds so I can get money like you 
64 2018-09-13 23:30:59 Hey Dean, It is precisely because they can't find enough opportunities. Ironically when 20 odd value funds all say they can find enough value stocks but they all own different names that combined would create a huge portfolio shows that value is in the eye of the holder. 1/2
65 2018-09-13 23:30:10 How marvelous for the uber wealthy who also happen to own stocks in Boeing and Lockheed.
66 2018-09-13 23:29:21 I can't wait for tournaments where people give isabelle players 4 homie stocks
67 2018-09-13 23:28:55 Well, it certainly doesn't "fit CAN SLIM." Crazy move - reminds me of the "(Insert Name Here) Blockchain" stocks of last December...
68 2018-09-13 23:28:51 Their stocks have fallen almost 7% it's what the company deserves
69 2018-09-13 23:28:30 CUBE KICKED HER AND E’DAWN OUT AND THEN THEIR STOCKS PLUMMETED AND THEN ASKED HER TO COME BACK jhahjsns

73 2018-09-13 23:25:30 Aren’t a lot of stocks at an all time high in the Trump economy?

our stocks are even lower. #auspol

77 2018-09-13 23:23:17 We got very cheerful opening a box received this week - yummy handmade paper, new stocks for the shelf, just sublimely rich and lush! We have about 16 different designs and colours now to choose from. Love them all.

79 2018-09-13 23:21:25 There is no reason to have bump stocks or large ammo clips meant for fast, maximum kill. We need real background checks, no cash/carry or online sales. They are reasonable requests. There is no logical reason to have high powered military grade weapons in civilian hands.
80 2018-09-13 23:21:21 wow cubes stocks crashed faster than my will to live
81 2018-09-13 23:21:18 How?
Are they going to force owners of companies to have their stocks
STOLEN. BY THE WORKERS???
Like hitler stole everything from all  their Jewish citizens??????

Owners will close down their companies!!!!
82 2018-09-13 23:20:55 I find it hard to genuinely identify ecosystem. Does anything with an API that can be integrated count? From my cursory analysis, most that are in the add on marketplace and are listed, are penny stocks
83 2018-09-13 23:20:02 realized lately that I’ve developed some bad trading habits, bought way too many marginal stocks. Good news is now I know and can fix $STUDY
84 2018-09-13 23:18:08 Cubes stocks be lookin like my grades these days
85 2018-09-13 23:17:53 Whose child are you?  Stocks represent the best way to measure social mood...and Socionomics (social mood) rules the world. You and I need to have a long discussion next time you’re home Grasshopper.
86 2018-09-13 23:17:40 Maybe they saw how upset people were. But Cube clearly does care. If you think they don't care that their stocks went down, that's wrong. A company lives off money. And if they can't get enough, there won't be a company. So whether they tell us they care or say nothing, they do.
87 2018-09-13 23:17:24 literally the best at stocks and shares. You show them

89 2018-09-13 23:15:43 @kayleighmcenany  With no safety protections the economy appears to be a positive trend.  Who cares about the results of no regulations and safety concerns.  Pretty reckless, don't you think. A steady growth with intelligent thought protects a Crash of the stocks recession.and
90 2018-09-13 23:15:00 Uhhh...consider the agenda of the source...and how many stocks they have in non-renewables.  

DOH!!
91 2018-09-13 23:14:57 iirc their stocks are already suffering and their investors are like freaking out
92 2018-09-13 23:14:26 @meisterbuerger It’s good they’re not going into SC. Sometimes after a run, stocks need to consolidate to move higher.
93 2018-09-13 23:13:54 okay if cube cared abt them dating that bad why would they retract their statement and said they are still not sure if they will kick them out. they saw their stocks went down to shit and new that they would be ruined.
94 2018-09-13 23:13:20 Who cares about stocks anyway?
95 2018-09-13 23:13:10 Lol does putting your friends penny stocks into your Roth IRA when they are worth a couple of cents and then your friends companies going public and then they are worth millions count as creative accounting?
96 2018-09-13 23:13:05 Awesome to see #Kmart now stocks @NBL merch for women, too!
97 2018-09-13 23:13:04 after kicking out Hyuna and E'Dawn?  their stocks went down?  well they deserve it anyway but I hope it won't affect the other group under its management.  
98 2018-09-13 23:12:43 TA WORKS PERFECT ON FX AND STOCKS SHHH DONT TELL ANYONE SHH.....

100 2018-09-13 23:11:40 We need to bring back the stocks and force these absolute jackwagons to stand in them while we throw cabbage at them
101 2018-09-13 23:11:25 WEED is among the few stocks I would feel comfortable buying and holding with a 3-5 year timeline. Long term holders won't be phased by this decline one iota.

105 2018-09-13 23:08:32 i hope Qantas Airline stocks go down. how dare you humiliate a man just because he has a wheelchair. Wheelchairs should be able to fit through the door of the airplane. People with disabilities have feelings too.
106 2018-09-13 23:04:59 Awesome.  My stocks are gonna rock! Thanks @realDonaldTrump
107 2018-09-13 23:04:33 Quick, burn your shoes to make the stocks go down!
108 2018-09-13 23:03:58 I have near zero exp in trading, but I think this is a false run (third one). If we get again negative us-china news it will dip once again. Also, cny-usd exchange should be checked: looks like these stocks follow the exchange rate closely. When sky is clear, these will

110 2018-09-13 23:03:04 I’m no hard core democrat or any party but Republicans really got swindled and bamboozled into thinking the Donald is gonna help anyone but the ultra wealthy. How’s the stock market working for y’all middle class families that don’t own any stocks?
111 2018-09-13 23:02:12 actually when you look at allocations its diversifaction there is pretty solid.... % leans more into stocks. So not aggressive, i see your point but, i should have posted percentage.
112 2018-09-13 23:01:23 Does anyone want to talk dividend yield and interest income mutual funds/stocks for retirement counts?

114 2018-09-13 23:00:51 Owned by someone until it is retired.  So when the WSJ says the retail investors missed the rally because they got out if stocks, how can that be?  Someone owned the stocks and ultimately there are people that get that exposure through funds and ETFs, right?  Nobody “missed” it.
115 2018-09-13 23:00:48 Like canadian pot stocks.._cronos and canopy). They eat poop today. (Crashing)
116 2018-09-13 23:00:02 supposedly they both didn't know they were basically fired until they read the articles and now cube is saying that nah they don't really mean it idk they are just stupid. their stocks plummeted overnight.
117 2018-09-13 22:59:29 $NIO One problem with stocks that everyone thinks they will be millionaires usually don’t work that way!
118 2018-09-13 22:59:08 right? dude is under 40 and stocks weed. how strange.
119 2018-09-13 22:58:59 Well there are more people under the company than just idols there are people working to get food on their tables and lowering stocks mean that those people get paid less sooooo
120 2018-09-13 22:58:15 Looks more like meth. I heard the meth stocks don't start trading until next year.

122 2018-09-13 22:57:40 Y’all do know that all of y’all wishing that Cube’s stocks continue to go down are wishing that people are going to be paid less and less and struggle to get food on their tables right? Smh
123 2018-09-13 22:56:57 Cash, stocks, and crypto.  Should hit a million in net worth by the end of the year.
124 2018-09-13 22:56:51 CUBE : Kick them out then since everyone doesn't like them anymore. 

*releases news of E'Dawn & Hyuna is out of the company. Stocks drop rapidly*

CUBE : Tell them it's not official yet! 


125 2018-09-13 22:56:36 might argue Airlines right now. (The big U.S. players).  It was too much supply, then labor costs, then jet fuel costs...but eventually these variables will stabilize at the same time and the stocks will perform, and sharply.
126 2018-09-13 22:56:13 If I spent half the time on stocks that I do on fantasy football I’d be retired by now
127 2018-09-13 22:55:39 leaders looking for new highs in already long term uptrends..  $TTWO $HUM $ISRG $SFIX $ILMN $IDXX $UNH $CRM $RMD $GRUB $INTU $HRC $ABT $ETSY $FTV $BSX etc etc etc.  I tweet the same stocks all the.  No need to look for new leaders when the same ones work over and over again.
128 2018-09-13 22:54:53 But I was also playing smash brothers during the entire direct and got 20 stocks off the bot
129 2018-09-13 22:54:25 Not going to happen. This is an unelected bureaucrat spouting off his own opinion.These stocks are publicly traded securities on American exchanges. What will they do, prosecute American investors and brokers too?
130 2018-09-13 22:52:49 This time we need to ensure assault weapons are defined in a way that even blanket 2A defenders cannot dismiss. Also, let’s ban accessories commonly used in mass shootings. No one needs big magazines, bump stocks, etc. And let’s make the law adaptable to new lethal innovations!

134 2018-09-13 22:51:36 We took exposure off earlier this week; cut faves to cores and 'went home' on non-cores, but there was no place to hide today.  Most stocks were off 10-15% vs. +68% and +37% mo/mo (now 17% / 43% < Jan highs).  Nibbled into the close (process) but powder to add into levels.
135 2018-09-13 22:51:13 New stocks have new products :-)   Those 1-2 year olds that make a new high are primmed for advances.

139 2018-09-13 22:49:41 Tbh, it’s not really wasting money as long as you spend it on stuff you need or want. If you enjoy slapping down money on shoes, hobby stuff, a certain charity, stocks, etc and it makes you happy, do it. One day you won’t even be able to use that money anyways.
140 2018-09-13 22:49:37 Maybe that's his backstory, his parents are stockbrokers who are ultra rich and taught him everything about the big gamble™ with stocks but he was dumb and went gambling their money away so they kicked him out
141 2018-09-13 22:48:22 yeah, their stocks went down hella and their just like "wait no guys it's still under discussion"
142 2018-09-13 22:48:00 im just cackling @ cube cs they just went from kicking 2 successful people out to thinking they can save this and "prank" us when their stocks drop to hell 
143 2018-09-13 22:47:49 Sim e focar-me nos meus objectivos académicos, para poder vencer na minha licenciatura e assim que a terminar, poder finalmente sair da vida académica e ir para o desejado emprego na reposição de stocks do Pingo Doce! :D
144 2018-09-13 22:47:10 Nike's stocks highest ever since Kaep. These jackasses really believe most people believe what they believe. This is the consistent 30%
145 2018-09-13 22:47:07 Think of stocks that have new N’s. Pot stocks had new industry perception/valuation when STZ invested in CGC. #NforNew $STUDY
146 2018-09-13 22:46:41 So cube suddenly decides to tell us they're still in talks with E'Dawn and Hyuna after their stocks plummets...
147 2018-09-13 22:45:48 eventually stocks follow bonds, right?
148 2018-09-13 22:45:24 75% of Canada’s current national debt is due to the last 2 Conservative governments. Harper sold government stocks at a loss to try and not show a deficit. While he was doing that he destroyed the eastern fisheries libraries leading to over fishing but go on.
149 2018-09-13 22:45:21 On October 12 Report: 

"Last month, NIO was a $7 stock. Today, it could touch $340/share. It's now one of the largest electric automobile stocks in the market."
150 2018-09-13 22:44:25 I think we mostly agree tbh. Stocks are a bubble ripe for bursting - I'm scaling into shorts right now! But to single out central bankers is to miss the fact they were thrown a hospital pass by govts who declined to take countercyclical fiscal measures when they were needed.
151 2018-09-13 22:44:14 Seems like business as usual, really. Are they gonna ask what stocks I've been trading? Probably not.
152 2018-09-13 22:43:05 I have cashed out of stocks
153 2018-09-13 22:42:14 @realDonaldTrump thanks to you and your team Nike stocks are at an all time high! I finally figured you out! You are using reverse-psychology on  all Americans and it’s working
154 2018-09-13 22:41:35 Jokes aside though, I'm actually very scared for CLC's future. They were already on the backburner of a failing company. How much less attention will Cube give them now? With their stocks skydiving, why would they pour money into CLC and not Gidle at a time they need a miracle?
155 2018-09-13 22:41:12 Sorry to say that but it's total bull. when @mandsireland and @marksandspencer put 50% sale on their website. They let you place orders then cancel it with the excuse 'out of stocks' even though it shows stocks available. My 3 separate orders got cancelled because of same reason
156 2018-09-13 22:40:51 TRUMP:
Unemployment WAY DOWN
GDP
Wage Growth
HOURLY WAGE UP
Blacks Employed

Black business ownership way up

157 2018-09-13 22:40:42 not sure why many traders took loss on after Trump tweeted. Nothing neg. Plus Who cares what he tweets. stocks always come back up, do they not? $amzn $aapl. Silly folks who follow chat room adv, & can't hold for a day. Keep losing n get GoFund me
158 2018-09-13 22:40:39 Fundamentals be damned. This BS spook story is what sends these stocks down? LOL.
159 2018-09-13 22:40:31 Marijuana stocks three years ago and apple twenty years ago.

169 2018-09-13 22:36:42 Big tobacco isn’t even 10% of the vape market. Two largest drops in adult smoking in last 20 years was in 2014 and 2015. Vape market tripled in 2013. When FDA made announcement yesterday, tobacco stocks gained $20billion in value. But sure vaping isn’t the threat to big tobacco
170 2018-09-13 22:36:25 Yamaha Outboard end of season sale while stocks last at A&P Marine.
171 2018-09-13 22:35:59 She was kicked out but then Cube retracted their statement and said it hasn't been decided yet (after they realized their stocks were going down)
172 2018-09-13 22:35:22 What is wrong with our leaders? 

1. Fossil fuels investments are killing the planet.

And of you don't believe this, many many institutional investors do, so it follows that:

2. Fossil fuels stocks are a bad long-term financial investment

Smh...

173 2018-09-13 22:35:04 I see lots of people chasing stocks that are moving. During my career my biggest wins came as a result of accumulating (open market or financings) size that was then sold at a multiple (not bragging). $PKG @ParcelPalInvest is no different been buying since 18-19
174 2018-09-13 22:35:04 Starting to make some money in stocks now that I’m getting the hang of this trend following & position sizing.
175 2018-09-13 22:34:56 Yes we do!!  Why stocks & purchases are up.  It’s brave and it’s about time.
176 2018-09-13 22:34:40 I always remind ammosexuals that fully auto guns are illegal and highly regulated, and that regulation actually works! However bump stocks and high capacity magazines are breeching the law’s best intentions.
177 2018-09-13 22:34:31 they said sike once their stocks started to plummet
178 2018-09-13 22:34:12 Nobody cares about  you until your stocks are doing good 
179 2018-09-13 22:34:05 So far, so good on $DNN $URG - Missed the $NIO today althougth the chat called it from go was too damn busy at work to make the real moeny today  @StockAlerts77 good call freind #stocks #daytrade #swingtrade #investing
180 2018-09-13 22:32:53 What are your thoughts on $VKTX...
181 2018-09-13 22:32:10 To the stocks you go!
182 2018-09-13 22:30:41 Most likely going to buy with these cheap prices.. idk tho bc I’m making really good profit with my current stocks 
183 2018-09-13 22:30:31 These are the 3 stocks in finance sector that yesterday marked all-time highs:
$AON, $BRO, $AJG
184 2018-09-13 22:30:17 Lmao now CUBES stocks are so low. Oh well who else is supporting Hyuna and E’dawn and the company they will make.
185 2018-09-13 22:30:11 That would suck if it want invite only lol!!! Try again.... oh Nike stocks are soaring
186 2018-09-13 22:29:20 Askip , ils sont en rupture de stocks
187 2018-09-13 22:28:18 @gsoldi after hours looking bad for pot stocks....at moment all down 7%
188 2018-09-13 22:28:04 Maybe he can use the knock of iPad to try investing in stocks and earn a lot of money with thatn
189 2018-09-13 22:27:54 Tenemos que usufructuar la euforia por cannabis stocks. Legalizala, Mauri. Exportemos al mundo. Es acá, es ahora
190 2018-09-13 22:27:23 @stoolpresidente you coming on Mad Money or what?! we’re waiting listening to Jim run on about railroad stocks 
191 2018-09-13 22:26:35 ok so .... they DID kick em out hut then took back theyre statement because their stocks dropped SO much that they called back their initial "we are kikcing them out" statement
192 2018-09-13 22:26:23 The stocks way up. He knows when his stock will be up before it even happens.
193 2018-09-13 22:26:07 Yes, I'm disappointed that they change their mind is because of their stocks. It's very sad but possibly eye opening for them
194 2018-09-13 22:25:56 Pot stocks are tanking as legalization is a month away. I  ordered a new vaporizer from the Yanks, free-trade rocks.
195 2018-09-13 22:25:32 13 #stocks reached record highs in technology sector yesterday.
196 2018-09-13 22:25:16 At one point NVDA/AMD were PC stocks that missed mobile as well
197 2018-09-13 22:25:07 One of the tradings strategies/TA's  I use is the moon phase strategy it's up overall in crypto and stocks but there's much better ones out there
198 2018-09-13 22:23:38 opo eomma, I got food stocks na rin po..
199 2018-09-13 22:23:35 Nike stocks at an all time high
200 2018-09-13 22:23:27 No particular news or event, although you could say there were some articles timed to support the bears and cause panic/selling. But ultimately these stocks have run far and fast and that makes large pullbacks all the more likely. Quick gains come with the risk of quick losses.
201 2018-09-13 22:22:47 These pot stocks make no sense, go up or down for no reason.
202 2018-09-13 22:22:15 really determined to learn more about stocks
203 2018-09-13 22:21:27 Love trad white Rioja and you have reminded me to visit a local vinter who stocks it (did not have any last time I visited).
204 2018-09-13 22:21:25 Because they realized that their stocks will be 7 feet under the fucking down if it wasn’t for hyuna literally cube is like :)) built upon her success :)))) so now they are being leeches like “nnnnope nvm”
205 2018-09-13 22:19:43 second, hyuna and edawn are superior and i hope that cube entertainment chokes on their stocks
206 2018-09-13 22:19:03 ByJeremy C. Owens Sept. 13, 2018 5:46 p.m. ET
Cannabis-related stocks dropped in after-hours trading Thursday following a report that the U.S. may bar Canadians who invest in the companies from entering the U.S.
207 2018-09-13 22:18:27 Que elle veut des mecs stocks tah brock lesnar j’ai la rage sur Glo 
208 2018-09-13 22:18:16 With a thriving stock market that we are in now, it's always wise to bet big on low-risk stocks
209 2018-09-13 22:17:56 See my article tomorrow on Sprott Money. Quick answer: Yes on Gold. Miners will be delayed a little. Could go down with stocks when the #crash occurs as they are stocks too.
210 2018-09-13 22:17:46 Can tech stocks crash so I can load up pls?
211 2018-09-13 22:17:19 Bump Stocks are still legal!  That should have been a lay-up!
212 2018-09-13 22:16:55 Cube Entertainment's stocks plummeted and now they backed out. LMAOOO shouldn't have dropped a queen like that in the first place #HYUNADESERVESBETTER
213 2018-09-13 22:16:40 I guess this explains @nedsegal desperation in selling his FREE $twtr stocks! But $300 mill for this guy? Trying to see what value he has added to me as a Shareholder?
214 2018-09-13 22:16:39 As the stocks lose value, the put options increase in value.
215 2018-09-13 22:16:09 Twitter Video Setup | Hurricane stocks 0:40, Bezos philanthropy 1:15, Walmart reaches deal with Nike 1:30, retailers hiring ahead of holiday season 1:50, good job situation 2:12. @NPetallides
216 2018-09-13 22:16:06 $ICON $FRAN $VTL but dip look for bounce
217 2018-09-13 22:15:38 Thank u, I should have clarified. The overvalued cannabis stocks are likely to go lower. I’m suggesting buying longer dated put options to profit as they lose value. $BTC is at a much fairer valuation right now.
218 2018-09-13 22:15:34  Have a look these #stocks that hit all-time highs: $EMR, $PHG
219 2018-09-13 22:15:27 Take out the windows and soak that place. Street stocks would probably be faster at this point
220 2018-09-13 22:13:43 Nike stocks closed today at an all-time high, another situation that flies in the face of America being a racist country, yes they are racist in our country but not at the level some people believe!
221 2018-09-13 22:12:36 Lol he put his friends penny stocks into his IRA and then his friends company's all skyrocketed
222 2018-09-13 22:11:43 Ahh man . Hard luck. Seeing increasingly more of these fake breakdowns in most of the stocks this week.
223 2018-09-13 22:11:11 @ClayTravis the company that made this flag stocks will def go down
224 2018-09-13 22:10:54 I’m honestly so DONE with cubes bs they probably got so scared when their stocks dropped so low last night
225 2018-09-13 22:10:43 @abubnic no one was grouping TPB w/ the MJ stocks on the way up, no need to include on the way down. Hardly a dumpster fire, actual business
226 2018-09-13 22:09:07 Yep, just like @Nike sales jumped 31% after Trump's boycott attack and stocks rose to their highest in the history of the company!! Trump sure does know how to promote things, doesn't he!? 
227 2018-09-13 22:08:25 Here we go all theses stocks hitting all-time hi's remember when this happened before the market crashed everyone lost there ass while all the CEO'S sold off there shares and got rich it's comming people be ready for the bottom to fall out
228 2018-09-13 22:08:00 Im worried with the remaining artists of cube and members of pentagon. Fucc dem. Karma rly hit dem hard when their stocks went down for real
229 2018-09-13 22:07:14 1. [+497, -25] Their stocks dropped ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Wow Cube's so pathetic. Hyuna-ya, just leave them.
230 2018-09-13 22:06:55 My stocks took a hit today but thats alright. I'm still up and pullbacks are natural.
231 2018-09-13 22:06:31 Always under review but I believe a lot of my top stocks which have outperformed for several years have a hint of tiredness about them, I’m judging whether they are fast asleep  or just having a nap.
232 2018-09-13 22:06:20 /LOL RIGHT lit like an hour after their stocks dropped over 6% they deadass just "LOL SIKE" 
233 2018-09-13 22:06:01 I am invested in the following stocks. I have followed and stayed invested in uranium since 2004.

Pot  - FIRE - CBW - BLO -TNY -EAT
Oil - CFW - TCW - ATH - OBE
Solar - XSNX

and a few others I am embarrassed to admit I am in LOL
234 2018-09-13 22:03:21 Any news this jumps 10% either way.
BREAKING Pot stocks drop after report that Canadian marijuana investors may be barred from U.S.
235 2018-09-13 22:02:06 I love the fact that the Nike stocks are at an all time high,that means Trump and the GOP will get clobbered in a big blue tidal wave in November!
236 2018-09-13 22:01:32 Amazing the excitement that ensues when weed stocks climb.
237 2018-09-13 22:01:24 Except all those people making a living off flipping Jordans, shows talking sneakers, ppl trading stocks, athletes playing sports...but I feel ya.
238 2018-09-13 21:59:52 just handed in my 1st set of #python homework ! Not easy & made it just in time. Hence why I have been quiet re trading views & chart analysis on #stocks & sector/factor lately. That #Savills bearish view since June is proving correct so far as my #energy plays- no change of view
239 2018-09-13 21:58:12 Invention du Béké pour finir les stocks avant les nouveaux stocks de Noel... 
240 2018-09-13 21:58:03 3/ bringing attn to a viable alternative to put our cash is NOT what @realDonaldTrump or the Fed wants to do but maybe we are truly at end game. the Fed will want some air to come out next month but it may gain momentum & since stocks are too important to crash, #QE4 will start..
241 2018-09-13 21:57:28 Incest x
242 2018-09-13 21:57:25 I think I've made my point. Stop and think before you call others outside of there name. Anyone with common sense knew the stocks would bounce back. That's what the market does. Stand for something positive in your life bro. It will change your life forever.
243 2018-09-13 21:56:33 All I see are tweets about idols singing "down" in their songs and it's about cube's stocks HAHAHA
244 2018-09-13 21:55:47 2 dui’s, armed robbery and violated house rules already by purchasing stocks in IPOs. NY can have Beto the lying Irishman faking he’s Mexican for votes.
245 2018-09-13 21:55:20 He keeps trying to manipulate the markets with his attacks. When it works I'm sure his cronies are buying up stocks cheap to gain control of as many companies as they can.
246 2018-09-13 21:55:05 I think I might be tasting the 60s again tomorrow the way today was. Not what I had in mind. I guess this is what these stocks will do to you.
247 2018-09-13 21:54:34 Why I like $EVI @EvimeriaIO?

249 2018-09-13 21:52:41 $AMD Stocks price movement is the great illusionist, it does a great job of making up look like down through the eyes of short term emotion. Trend is still up, object in motion stays in motion.
250 2018-09-13 21:52:35 SO HYUNA AND E’DAWN WERE KICKED OT OF CUBE LET’S WATCH THEIR STOCKS CRUMBLE!!! 
#HYUNA #EDAWN
251 2018-09-13 21:51:38 Dang, where the heck do you get your information fake news? Those kids have spas, barbers, beauty parlors, their own library, so that takes care of those kids, they live better than ours, we have gotten raises, lower taxes, stocks off the wall, economy better than ever
252 2018-09-13 21:51:28 Unpopular Opinion: Even if ICOs are able to democratize access to early stage investment, they wont kill VCs or any other professional investor.

253 2018-09-13 21:51:02 Cube: kicks out Hyuna and EDawn

*Stocks dropping like flies*

Cube: This was an Experiment we wanted to see how’d you react if we kicked them out to expose all the toxicness in the fandom thank you for proving us right.

259 2018-09-13 21:48:23 Why TF didn't you have him shooting the lemons with a bunch of "assault weapons" with bump stocks and drum magazines? "30 magazine clip, half a second" would have annihalated the juice right out of those !
260 2018-09-13 21:48:01 wait so cube are now trying to decide again if they’re gonna get removed?? they saw them stocks go down and got scared like a mf

you noticed your stocks dropping into the depths of hell and saw the possibility of going bankrupt so you decide to not kick them out? what are y’all on? you must sniff crack cocaine to be this incoherent i swear 
snakes lmao
276 2018-09-13 21:37:02 They saw those stocks drop
277 2018-09-13 21:36:52 @timseymour what's going on with cannabis stocks now... aftr hours... Is this an opportunity or no-touch?
278 2018-09-13 21:36:52 The best stocks to purchase now is cannibus companies and Nike.
279 2018-09-13 21:36:40 Well shit, with how many my wife stocks up in the house you’d think they do. Haha
280 2018-09-13 21:36:28 So after cube sees the stocks go down and all the people dissing them they now say they're just "thinking about it"? that's messed up
281 2018-09-13 21:35:58 Huge thanks to @realDonaldTrump for being such a racist bigot.  Nike stocks closed today at the highest price in company history!  #peacefulprotest
282 2018-09-13 21:35:20 @ScottGottliebMD And you gotta love how much money your announcement against vaping made for big tobacco companies yesterday. I wonder how much that bump in stocks yesterday was worth all the lives you are playing with.
283 2018-09-13 21:35:00 Hardest thing about trading stocks is waiting for them to move - a lot of fuckin w8in sometimes Jesus
284 2018-09-13 21:34:53 If battle rappers were stocks I’d invest in these rappers for the upcoming quarter. All sponsors and promoters may wanna take note:

@_kay_shine 
@Sharkcity_Ave 
@MRDIZASTER 
@GeechiGotti 

I’d also invest in @Jayblac1615 and champion

300 2018-09-13 21:28:40 What kind of stocks reach all time highs and lows on the same day? Penny stocks?
301 2018-09-13 21:28:37 i put it on my potential short list 1 hour ago. seems like prior 50 day resistance and noted slow burn downtrend last two times @ 50. who knows where the chinese stocks go. could go up,up,up and would nor suprise me.

304 2018-09-13 21:27:50 Problem is after watching the interview, if a major share holder(s) thinks that Elon is no longer competent they might sell their shares, thus reducing share price of Tesla stocks and hurting ppl who are invested with Tesla on the long run
305 2018-09-13 21:27:45 Stocks can moon too?
306 2018-09-13 21:26:19 Actually no just look at the stocks
307 2018-09-13 21:25:46 They changed their mind after they saw their stocks drop
308 2018-09-13 21:24:48 So doing something completely legal, and investing in stocks that are also legally listed in the US, can cause a problem. Lol. Wow.
309 2018-09-13 21:23:36 Thanks for taking an interest Mr. Rubio. With your help, perhaps we can get some meaningful legislation passed. For example, wouldn't it be great if bump stocks were banned? You can become a co-sponsor and #BanBumpStocks

312 2018-09-13 21:22:50 What cheese’s me off is I never smoked dope, always was taught it’s bad for you. Now I am hearing that all these dope smokers bought up lots of marijuana stocks because they new it would be a big thing and now retiring at a young age Morale: Don’t believe in what others tell you.
313 2018-09-13 21:22:46 Ay uncle bern, you should start accepting bitcoin for cookies and go public for stocks
314 2018-09-13 21:20:58 So you're trying to tell me that stocks (all of them) go up and down on a daily basis and sometimes reach highs and lows in the same day?  I'm shocked
315 2018-09-13 21:20:19 stocks: drop
cube: wdym i never said that hyuna and hyojong are my friends
316 2018-09-13 21:20:01 This is their problem ... we need a southern and likely a northern wall.  Buy stocks in wall builders you should do pretty well!
317 2018-09-13 21:18:06 I was right When I said @Nike will reach its highest in stocks after @realDonaldTrump said it would fall. 
Nike don’t I deserve a pair of Jordan’s? Cmon now. lol
318 2018-09-13 21:17:09 Time to start buying stocks from the oil companies!
319 2018-09-13 21:16:40 Now is the time to look away from the capital market. Stocks will likely keep tanking as we enter political season.

323 2018-09-13 21:14:58 I started with robinhood app but now i'm switching over to Ameritrade. Robinhood is limited to a lot of foreign stock markets but it's free to trade vs Ameritrade where you can likely track and buy stocks with anyone. Im def keeping an eye out on the political forecast
324 2018-09-13 21:14:40 This is fucked up. It’s not about the stocks bc they actually didn’t drop that much, but it’s a scare tactic. They’re trying to threaten hyuna and edawn by flexing the power they have over them. Knets are on cube’s side and that’s so wrong.
325 2018-09-13 21:14:31 Did you sell any of your cannabis stocks today?
326 2018-09-13 21:14:15 When I surveyed our top clients Today, this is where they were putting their money to work. And in this order!...

- stocks / cyber security
- cannabis stocks [in a boom right now]
- Allocation to Bitoin & crypto. 

Quite interesting!

327 2018-09-13 21:11:14 I have yet to play with stocks, but it's on my list of things to do. What do you use? In my mind a blue wave this fall would seriously impact the forecast of the market. This NY primary could be big for NYs position in this market.
328 2018-09-13 21:11:07 Not true.  Mike is not.  He does not discuss his picks and at the time of this video (6/17) his Sachem Cove Fund was not started.  Sachem was started about a year later.  I have yet to find any video where he promotes stocks at all.  If I cant you cant since I search all.

338 2018-09-13 21:07:02 Don’t count me as a hater but .. 110 trades without a single loss....in stocks like $TLRY... I don’t believe it.  I’ve seen the price action move instantly against positions. No way to believe your numbers. With just Support and resistance? no way. ... really?

341 2018-09-13 21:05:57 @SaraEisen All stock indices are trading at all-time highs. High beta stocks like Nike should be trading higher than indices. Nike is strong because of Michael Jordan. Colin is a big mistake.
342 2018-09-13 21:05:50 Ro Khanna displays his economic illiteracy.

A rising stock market CREATES jobs- because stocks are currency for companies.

IPO's create jobs. 

A @Starbucks stock price rise allows them to build new retail locations.

Like most socialists, Ro Khanna is an economic imbecile.
343 2018-09-13 21:04:11 Well, long/short equity failed because shorting basically didn’t work for a decade, I think in part because of low rates, which helped zombie companies survive. Also, ETFs reward baskets of stocks, not indiv stocks. Encouraged risk-on, hurt price discovery.

obv twitter and korea had a major breakdown.
367 2018-09-13 20:58:22 No - far too early for any impact on Junior miners TBird. That will occur when the talking heads are promoting it and your local cab driver asks which U stocks to pick.

Stop being shitty to your artists and keep Hyuna and E'Dawn.
371 2018-09-13 20:57:30 That's short-term gains. Throw a little in stocks/401 and invest in property for your own spot. You know the deal.

373 2018-09-13 20:55:57 said differently, the most value-oriented, highest profitability stocks in the worst performing sector of each market have outperformed the growthiest, lowest profitability stocks in the best performing sector except 1 or 2 outliers?

379 2018-09-13 20:53:18 "Buy low, sell high" does not mean sell at each all-time high.

380 2018-09-13 20:52:48 The middle class see the cost of those cheap products go through the roof with no real increases in wages. Those wages where suppose to go up when you gave your buddies a tax cut but they are to busy buying up their stocks so they make more when they exercise their options.
381 2018-09-13 20:52:22 I saw that cube's stocks went down after the announcement so I guessed they got scared there... But I don't really know, I wasn't that active on Twitter today

385 2018-09-13 20:51:52 Why do you think they backtracked so hard? If she wasnt vital to the company then the would've stuck with the decision. The moment the backtracked their stocks went back up.
386 2018-09-13 20:51:51 Not sure I understand your question. Do you mean why Cameco has CCJ instead of CCO? If yes, it is because many stocks are present at more than one index, e.g both CA and US. And they always have different tickers. CCO is the ticker for the CA index and CCJ may be US.

403 2018-09-13 20:45:41 After a strong 2007 in spring 2008 I went to my CIO, said we were having to sell stocks and couldn't find anything to buy. Wanted to take my mutual fund to 20% cash. He said to cut my cash weight from 7% to 3%.
404 2018-09-13 20:45:16 I second that. Buy Nikon. My stocks will go up. ;)
405 2018-09-13 20:44:45 @claremontandmay hi there. I'm searching without success for your Orange Grove 100ml room sprays. Can I get it directly from you or who stocks it.
406 2018-09-13 20:44:44 No one wanted any grandpas stocks today as they all went back to the tech stocks they sold Monday lol $XLP $QQQ
407 2018-09-13 20:43:56 only on (upper) middle class wealth. The wealthiest have their wealth in stocks and bonds.
408 2018-09-13 20:43:46 thoughts on nike stocks ?
409 2018-09-13 20:43:45 I purchased a few stocks!
410 2018-09-13 20:43:39 THEIR STOCKS DROPPED DRASTICALLY
411 2018-09-13 20:43:33 Their stocks said let them fuk
412 2018-09-13 20:42:41 They will print money in the next one too. Maybe even expand QE to stocks?
413 2018-09-13 20:42:34 Their stocks are already going downhill rapidly so yeah they messed up BIG TIME
414 2018-09-13 20:41:51 Fuck stocks, sales numbers will be out soon.
415 2018-09-13 20:40:04 Becuase their stocks dropped by like a loT
416 2018-09-13 20:39:08 Wow. Lots of weed stocks took a hit today. RSI was pretty high on most. Will see if any rebound next week if any get rec use licenses after close tomorrow.
417 2018-09-13 20:38:38 If you are holding FB, Twitter and Google stocks it appears that they have topped and are reacting to the regulatory sentiment. Now might be a good time to take profit. IMO 12 to 18 mos. from now they will be quite different regulated entities.
418 2018-09-13 20:38:38 penny stocks bro some doubled their money in a day, but mostly got rekt just like crypto.
419 2018-09-13 20:37:54 Did investors sell their other cannabis stocks to buy more $tlry today?
420 2018-09-13 20:37:40 Invest in stocks, mutual funds, and blue chip companies
421 2018-09-13 20:36:54 These fuckers can't even get a 3 month economic forecast right. Anything they say is wrong, consistently wrong.

Put them in the stocks with Soubry and May.
422 2018-09-13 20:36:24 We make our own stocks here, but we can really appreciate the love, effort and care that goes in to it! Good luck!
423 2018-09-13 20:35:48 Did Visa stocks crash from over -75%? hehe god save litecoin
424 2018-09-13 20:35:24 And the stocks did trash today fuck
425 2018-09-13 20:33:55 We also have our Simply Chicken and Simply Vegetable Stocks without added sugars. Hope that helps!
426 2018-09-13 20:33:31 #GCL nudged under NAV for the first time in weeks today; but US and TSX uranium stocks all on a tear today...
427 2018-09-13 20:33:23 Yup they have stateside reps that work as a go between for the printer overseas and they have a great selection of stocks and finishes
428 2018-09-13 20:32:47 I can buy infinite things with that money  Also some stocks with Mi company
429 2018-09-13 20:32:47 Was on a date tonight, which was nice until I learned that she 1. Believed 9/11 was an inside job. 2. Was anti-vax 3. Believed she could bi-locate to different astral planes 4.believed she could talk to aliens 5. Claimed to have an algorithm that traded stocks based on astrology
430 2018-09-13 20:32:31 Investors have suddenly soured on many bank stocks the last two sessions. Not clear on the reasoning. Today's losers:

$BAC -1.0%
$ZION -1.2
$CMA -1.4
$BBT -1.4
$BK -1.5
$WFC -1.7
$MTB -2.0
$STI -4.7

vs S&P +0.5%
431 2018-09-13 20:32:07 Wow Cube....hated the backlash and their stocks dropped so they cancelled the firing...

I think Cube is the one not to be trusted lmao
432 2018-09-13 20:31:58 Stocks rise. The Dow closed at 26,145.99, up 147.07 (+0.57%). Nasdaq +0.75%. S&P +0.53%.

434 2018-09-13 20:30:08 Am I only one who stocks up on the peppermint chapstick when it’s in season? 
435 2018-09-13 20:30:06 They saw their stocks fall lmao
436 2018-09-13 20:30:04 And the worst could come when the stocks fall as the bonds

Or the U$D is avoided as a disease

Then, all the pension funds, start to discover that they do not have so much money to cover their expectations

Print babe, print

Pufff!
437 2018-09-13 20:30:03 Who woulda thought stocks would put my money up like dis
438 2018-09-13 20:29:17 because their stocks went 
these clowns are acting like they wouldn’t be losing the crux of their company
439 2018-09-13 20:29:14 Only at MHCC Level 1.....specials not be missed starting today until Wednesday 19/09/18 or while stocks last!!
440 2018-09-13 20:28:58 they took it back once they saw their stocks plummet >>
441 2018-09-13 20:28:56 Well, one would think that NGO's like Tobacco Free Finland are devastated whenever tobacco stocks rise. I'm no longer so sure about that since their main focus seems to be on attacking low risk products and stopping smokers from switching to them.
442 2018-09-13 20:28:14 Sorry, not wealthy, but I do alright, my stocks are outstanding now, I have slowly been purchasing them online for years.  Democrats are why people are on welfare, they put them their and leave them.  Work for Welfare, Learn while on Welfare, get people off Welfare!
443 2018-09-13 20:28:12 They do. Rn theyre just tryna cover their asses sense their stocks keep falling
444 2018-09-13 20:28:09 Well now, after their stocks dropped, their saying its not CONFIRMED that they were kicked out ??
445 2018-09-13 20:27:10 yee i got 1 $tsla, and free stocks: 1 $znga and 1 $f
446 2018-09-13 20:26:20 i did.  what i think about stocks and where stocks will go as a function of supply and demand or two separate things.  just imo
447 2018-09-13 20:26:18 4 months! Yes for the full coverage of stocks. But the LO has applied for a number of major stocks since 1.1.2015 without success. Will more stocks weigh on the non-compliance side  or do we have a tool to correct the situation. The opportunity arise when deciding TACs for 2019
448 2018-09-13 20:26:12 Well then, well done by all of you.  I think Massachusetts should bring back the stocks in the public square for these two.  I'm sure the vets at Hanscom AFB will be happy to provide the rotten vegetables.
449 2018-09-13 20:25:12 Me, looking at stocks as I pass them: God, I love you.
450 2018-09-13 20:25:10 Yes, the BoE buys everything... Stocks and bonds

But has a surplus in the Balance of Pavements

You could add other thing: the U$D is the currency reserve of the World

It means the Amerikan Debt Krisis is exported before comes back and hits home
451 2018-09-13 20:25:05 No, the money he made was through stocks. Amazon's work force made the value. In any case, he's not a generous man, just an individual with way too much power, money, and influence. In a sane society, he wouldn't have that much money to "give away".
452 2018-09-13 20:25:01 I’ve been making some killer trades in the discord, did 20% today shorting a few stocks. I keep my lev low though typically 3x, but depends on the trade.
453 2018-09-13 20:24:03 @cubeunited so y’all finally noticing your stocks going down so y’all release a statement saying “it’s still undergoing decisions”. After all that, I don’t think they’d reconsider coming back to Cube watch them go be successful somewhere else lol #CubeEntertainment #CubeIsOver
454 2018-09-13 20:23:30 Looking to buy some stocks, and suggestions out there?
455 2018-09-13 20:23:12 I lost $5k in stocks today, but I feel shittier about @ErikKarlsson65 getting traded
456 2018-09-13 20:22:45 They saw their stocks plummet in like 5 hours
457 2018-09-13 20:22:13 Where's the 5 day outlook?  Take a average because stocks change by the minute.
458 2018-09-13 20:22:02 Well 1fox is suppose to be a crypto exchange, meaning only crypto currencies will be traded there. The only crypto on 1broker is bitcoin. It’s mostly stocks and forex, Personally waiting for more markets to appear on 1fox before I make an account.
459 2018-09-13 20:21:57 Stocks simply close when they dump too hard. Stocks also close when it’s weekend because traders need to take a nap. 

Being a paying system or a platform as an example forces crypto to be active 24/7 (besides exchange errors). Savage & fast by concept.
460 2018-09-13 20:21:24 Just as an FYI these are high-risk high-upside stocks that are poised to jump. IBM I have as a longer term hold. The other two are breakouts that recently oversold. The recovery looks like 50%+
461 2018-09-13 20:21:23 how many gold stocks back in the day doubled on no news, while the rest went down ? give me a break
462 2018-09-13 20:20:51 There only saying that bullshit because stocks went down  Yea guess what cube! You lost a fan! @cubeunited Rest in Piece Cube!
463 2018-09-13 20:20:11 US stocks closed higher on the day: $DJIA +147, $SPX +15
464 2018-09-13 20:20:03 US stocks closed higher on the day: $DJIA +147, $SPX +15
465 2018-09-13 20:19:52 IMO, this is the only reasonable reason to process oil into products at max levels with higher than seasonal stocks - bet on upside.
Just in case: I uderstand that I don't take #crude_quality_matters into account. 2/2
466 2018-09-13 20:19:04 What are the odds that @realDonaldTrump is investing in paper towel stocks before Hurricane Florence?
467 2018-09-13 20:18:45 Must've seen all the stocks go down
468 2018-09-13 20:18:41 He too busy to ramp so now he doesn’t know how to short stocks
469 2018-09-13 20:18:13 If you scale it down to the actual $16.3 billion of his that isn’t tied up in stocks, you get 12% of his worth. That’s a pretty high percentage.
470 2018-09-13 20:17:49 It was a joke to show the importance of Hyuna and the injustice done to the pair of them. They don't mean it seriously. Hyuna and Hyojong deserve better and people are mad. Their stocks did drop and now they have changed their mind. We want them to stay.
471 2018-09-13 20:17:31 I feel like cube actually doesn’t know what to do anymore. They messed everything up so much with not telling Hyuna and E’dawn that they were kicked out of Cube and then when their stocks went down they said that they were still discussing it. Seriously.......#CubeIsOverParty
472 2018-09-13 20:17:23 cube: we're kicking hyuna and edawn out
*their stocks plummet and they get backlash*
cube: oh no wait i take it bac-
473 2018-09-13 20:16:57 As #SP500 again gets closer to new all-time highs, #TSX is barely hanging on to 16,000 - a level just 9% higher than it was 10 years ago. Canadian stocks have a backseat roll in your portfolio... at best.
474 2018-09-13 20:16:41 Says a man who prolly never followed how gold stocks traded in relation to the metal back in the day.
475 2018-09-13 20:16:37 As most of the businesses are consolidating after the disruption there is a shift from unorganised to organised of which consumer stocks are the major contributors.
One can look at 10% portfolio allocation in consumer fund. Consumer story remains intact in India.
476 2018-09-13 20:16:28 Assuming you want to do this legally, your best option may be to buy a few shares of publicly traded distillery stocks. Legally owning your own still is exceedingly difficult in Florida (or anywhere in the US).
477 2018-09-13 20:16:16 Couple little breathers today . But all and all another fantastic day . Looking forward to next week and the weeks to come on a few more stocks 
478 2018-09-13 20:16:12 i find it funny as hell that after cube said hyuna and hyojong were kicked tf out tHEIR STOCKS DROPPEd SO THEY TOOK IT BACK SJHDHSJSJTHESE DUMBASSES
479 2018-09-13 20:16:08 they reconsidered kicking them out bcs of their lowering stocks oOf
480 2018-09-13 20:15:50 Stocks rallied early on news of softening inflation, then treaded water the rest of the session. 

Dow closed +147, +0.6% to 26,145. Nasdaq +0.8%, S&P +0.5%. 

But smaller stocks were weak: Russell 2000 -0.1%.
481 2018-09-13 20:15:45 On revenge there was this group full of rich people who invested in stocks then planned and saw out catastrophic events because they knew the stocks they invested in would go crazy after said events now I’m wondering if we’ve ever experienced any shit like that
482 2018-09-13 20:15:06 Dow rises 147 points. Nasdaq climbs 0.8% as tech stocks rebound. Kroger dives 10%. US oil sinks 2.5%. BU-114TH
483 2018-09-13 20:14:26 Promises kept: Cut taxes, cut burdensome regulations helping to bring jobs and businesses back, stocks up, unemployment down, moved embassy to Jerusalem, Gorsuch, Kavenaugh, progress with North Korea, pulling out of Iran deal, reworking crappy trade deals, NAFTA...
484 2018-09-13 20:14:06 I don’t own individual stocks personally and would guess this is irrational, but I have no idea
485 2018-09-13 20:14:05 They saw their stocks go all the way down and were like FFJSKE GO BACK
486 2018-09-13 20:13:53 HEGEMON FACTION stocks pull-back amid troubling geopolitical headlines
487 2018-09-13 20:13:53 Cube aren't just BTOB. Hyuna has been there a long time. Criticising cube as the company and saying their stocks dropping, isn't saying BTOB contribute nothing. Please don't misunderstand it, people are just trying to fight for Hyuna and Hyojong. 
488 2018-09-13 20:13:49 I was feeling pretty good about $DBX till I remembered stocks were supposed to gp up. Then I had a good cry. I'm better now
489 2018-09-13 20:13:32 @ramit enjoy this article from Business Inside that looks into whether stocks or home ownership has a higher return. Is buying a house a better investment than the stock market? We did the math, and the answer is clear - Business Insiderhttps://apple.news/AmkrbaeRdRNy1ovh1hDBApw
490 2018-09-13 20:13:27 So disappointed in my self for making wrong plays on stocks that are given money makers. How does one lose money on something that’s up 75% on the day. Fuck man
491 2018-09-13 20:13:08 Karmic stocks plummeted today upon the mid-journey realization I left a soiled diaper on the roof of my car. #ihopetheirwiperswork #parentfail
492 2018-09-13 20:12:44 They backed out of their decision after all the hate they got and their stocks dropping. So, now things are being discussed. Hell HyunA and E’Dawn didn’t even know they were being kicked out originally until they saw the articles online.
493 2018-09-13 20:12:36 Stocks plunged as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. unveiled a direct candy cane today.
494 2018-09-13 20:12:04 he crypto slump is that ramifications for the global economy are likely to be minimal. While the market has lost more than $640 billion of value since peaking in January, that’s a far cry from the trillions erased from Nasdaq Composite stocks during the dot-com bust. @Bloomberg
495 2018-09-13 20:12:03 cube saw their stocks dropping and said sike hyuna nd edawn come back
496 2018-09-13 20:11:58 World stocks ex Europe higher: US +.5%; Europe -.15%. Hints of easing trade tensions with China reinvigorated Asian & US stocks. Currently, more downside risk from trade issues than upside potential. In either case expect significant volatility. Short-term cash is still king.
497 2018-09-13 20:11:29 Google is evil fro there stocks and send message MAGA
498 2018-09-13 20:10:17 OMG, AFTER SEEING HOW BAD THEIR STOCKS DROPPED, CUBE IS NOW SAYING THEY'RE "DISCUSSING" KICKING THEM OUT BUT HAVEN'T ACTUALLY, LOL. HYUNA SHOULD STILL LEAVE THOUGH TO TEACH THEM A LESSON
499 2018-09-13 20:10:16 Him jumping in net worth has very little to do with actual income and more to do with the fact that stocks are soaring and his company is speculatively valued at $1 Trillion. If tomorrow, the stock market crashes, so does his net worth... at 100 times the rate of your net worth.
500 2018-09-13 20:10:10 Since everyone has been talking about 1fox I also want to mention 1broker which is the parent website of 1fox where I have been trading stocks,commodities, and forex using btc. So far it’s really nice I’m up around 30% since I started trading there.
501 2018-09-13 20:09:34 Stocks only or anything?
502 2018-09-13 20:09:23 Not only BUY houses on the beach or a flood zone, or unmanaged forest (read: Wildfire kindling)  but pay PREMIUM for it.

Then get on the news about how they "lost everything"

So sad, they might have to sell off some stocks to cover the insurance deductable.
503 2018-09-13 20:09:19 Rebranding this account now that pot stocks are the next big thing, expect tons of screenshots from obscure botany textbooks going forward
504 2018-09-13 20:08:23 You do know that the majority of his net-worth is tied into stocks in his company and other non liquid capital, right? You might be worth $1 Million but half could be in the value of your house and most of the rest being your 401k account, leaving 10-20k cash in your actual bank.
505 2018-09-13 20:08:19 Nope it's fake and you will find that out soon enough.
506 2018-09-13 20:08:16 I’m highly interested in finance education. I listen to podcasts read blogs stalk stocks.
507 2018-09-13 20:08:14 So you’re conflating weath growth of a necessity (housing) to weath growth of corporate stocks of extreme levels?

Brain genius you are.

509 2018-09-13 20:06:31 > cube released an official statement saying they’re kicking out hyuna and edawn and there was no trust
> after their stocks plummeted, they released another statement that supposedly it wasn’t a concrete decision (contradicting the first statement). it was also revealed that
510 2018-09-13 20:06:18 #DYOR but, you can do it via Robinhood app (that means you need to be US citizen), haven't checked other options but I am sure there are. There are a lot of platforms and brokers to trade stocks
511 2018-09-13 20:06:03 Look at the inactives on the reinstated.  It matches with OTCMarkets officer list.  Looks legit to me.  Well, as legit as it can be in  OTC land.  I don’t own and am not buying, but I think it legit.
512 2018-09-13 20:05:21 $FNKO is not a stock to be in... Many stocks like this
513 2018-09-13 20:05:21 Would Senators still be able to buy index or some other mutual fund? I think it doesn't make senses to prevent them from having any stocks, just picking ones based on inside knowledge.

Also, not sure about the ban on lobbyists. It feels a bit like a ban on association.
514 2018-09-13 20:05:03 and its pretty f up cause hyun* and hy*j*ng are popular, as a single member, and for them in the group. I’m kinda happy c*be stocks plummeted :)
515 2018-09-13 20:04:26 if you are dumb enough to think I buy your whole stock market story and fortunes on pot stocks then you are too dumb to make a living pkaying the stock market.

517 2018-09-13 20:03:21 I can't see why you would say that. I mean it's not like they fired two stars only to say that they weren't fired when the company stocks plummeted.
518 2018-09-13 20:03:06 Kind of confusing!  the reinstated one shows an amendment on 12/11/2009 to raise the AS from 500 million to 2 billion! hummm! we shall find out soon!
519 2018-09-13 20:02:41  
If #2A ONLY applied to muskets, then #1A applied ONLY to 1791. Until Vegas/Paddock NO ONE knew what a bump stock was. They’ve been around for YEARS and only ONE crime has been committed with them. If you are concerned w/ precision bump stocks are not your accessory.
520 2018-09-13 20:02:06 Just buy consumer internet stocks at 10x + sales. The rest of this stuff is old school, its different now.
521 2018-09-13 20:01:19 Cube’s stocks went down with 7% when cube announced HyunA and E’Dawn were kicked out (in just one hour). They are definitely important for Cube.....
522 2018-09-13 20:01:13 Haha I'm just dreaming. But I do think a 20x is very possible. What are your stocks?
523 2018-09-13 19:59:32 I'm up 200% on $AMD puts today. Next weeks expiration.... Penny stocks are a joke.
524 2018-09-13 19:58:05 $APH - Sharp correction in the dope stocks. Took 1/2 off a day or so ago. Watching a descending wedge form on the 15min
525 2018-09-13 19:57:21 why does everyone want to short the pot stock tlry?
i thought we all loved pot stocks 

and trying to short the first company to start shipping internationally isnt really the hill i would look to die on, there are plenty of frauds and dumb ideas that die first
526 2018-09-13 19:57:14 Hey Jayden. I can introduce you to forex and binary options which is similar to stocks but much more potential. I am using a platform to learn about all of this. Follow me back so we can DM.
527 2018-09-13 19:57:05 Wrong.  The SS and disclosure statements on OTC show the reinstated one is the correct one.
528 2018-09-13 19:55:57 Global warming won't kill the people causing it. It will kill people living in shacks near estuaries growing subsistence crops and catching dwindling fish stocks for survival.
529 2018-09-13 19:55:24 I stan BTOB also and I understand your side. But please don't keep commenting like that. Their stocks have dropped massively because of this. Cube did Hyuna and Hyojong wrong and they're now realising it. No one is putting BTOB down. Hyuna has done a lot for Cube. 
530 2018-09-13 19:55:02 So last year some friends and I made a quick buck off stocks that benefitted from the hurricane but they already talking about the stocks now and the hurricane hasn't hit and its making me feel hella guilty
531 2018-09-13 19:54:53 This the right one.  The other one only has 500,000,000 a/s.  The reinstated one matches up with OTCMARKETS.
532 2018-09-13 19:54:42 ia hyuna and edawn shouldn’t have heard about it through the news articles but cube probably wanted to deny it so their stocks wouldn’t drop/lose fans?? either way it backfired majorly lmfao
533 2018-09-13 19:54:27 Marijuana stocks getting smoked today #CGC #CRON
534 2018-09-13 19:54:24 They saw their stocks took a massive dip

540 2018-09-13 19:49:42 I understand the word "dropped" has become the new cool way of saying  something new is out, e.g. "that new track [song] dropped, today".  However, I wouldn't use it when talking about stocks, e.g. "that new stock dropped, today".

543 2018-09-13 19:47:44 Couldn't disagree that many stocks in the space have that fate bro, but these one - there's legit valuation support ...  which is the set up for M&A (what the sector is fundamentally playing for right now)
544 2018-09-13 19:47:32 Not an exact compare but close enough. It’s more like tech stocks in the 90s with no product or a great product that cannot deliver those returns for years.

A) price of a lb of weed is down 35 to 40 % in 2 years in states where legalized. 

B ) Canada's *black market* already exports an est 20% surplus of production

Pot stocks will get very cheap...

Hyuna & E’Dawn: *looks at each other then looks back at the ceo*.... Goodbye. *walks out the door*

568 2018-09-13 19:33:27 People got kicked out of the company for dating and going public but apparently their stocks yanked so now they are saying “no decision yet”
569 2018-09-13 19:33:15 it's what we pay you for. imagine if you spent our dosh on stocks and bonds, it would be preposterous

573 2018-09-13 19:32:59 On thursdays when there are stocks with weekly options, I love to short stocks that run and sell puts on them. Did that in $AAPL and $NVDA as well today. Muy bueno
574 2018-09-13 19:32:07 So based on my Apple Stocks falling the new IPhones are no good??
575 2018-09-13 19:31:59 I should buy stocks in a life preserver company with them all going off the deep end like they are.
576 2018-09-13 19:31:41 So apparently now Cube decided not to kick out E’Dawn and HyunA. Cube probably saw there stocks and seeing how much is going down and was like shit. 
#cube #edawn #HYUNA
577 2018-09-13 19:31:14 @dirtbikedude66 Yeah— it happens , never know . No one predicts stocks.
578 2018-09-13 19:31:04 So Cube got scared when their stocks dropped? lol When's Hyuna's contract period end? Dust Cube and make em suffer, girl. You have the power
579 2018-09-13 19:31:03 Well, SC adjusts they say.
And, in any case, this is the chart the largest TA chart service site provides so that is what the rest have too. 
If we would reason like that, maybe half of the charts for resource stocks would be useless, and that is not the case. 
And lin vs log.
580 2018-09-13 19:30:10 They saw their stocks drop and panicked... the absolute shit heads. If you’re gonna play the moral high ground and claim a breach of trust then stick to it!
581 2018-09-13 19:28:51 Trading Chinese Stocks are tricky. If you watched the Joe Rogan interview of Elon Musk, then you will realize that his intelligence is two magnitudes higher than us. I wouldn’t bet against him.
582 2018-09-13 19:28:23 I'll hold as long as it takes if I believe in the stock

I learned to not buy into stocks I don't believe in... Lost my ass that way

591 2018-09-13 19:24:41 HYUNA IS A QUEEN I LOVE THAT BITCH I HOPE HER STOCKS GO UP FOREVER
592 2018-09-13 19:24:17 Then cotton stocks would go through the roof.
593 2018-09-13 19:23:55 After cube's stocks went down
594 2018-09-13 19:23:48 Time to be greedy a and pile up stocks cos after election it will sky rocket
595 2018-09-13 19:22:48 theyre scared bec their stocks went down. i guess cube is testing the after effects if they officially disown them
596 2018-09-13 19:22:35 Stock market crash gives the #Fed the excuse to end #QT, revert to #QE at stocks prices 30-40% below ATHs to make it more effective than if they were to do it today. Stocks soar, bond yields fall, but the dollar is toast as a result. One more hike in Sept. 10Y to 3.3-3.5% peak.
597 2018-09-13 19:22:23 This, at its core, is why stocks are going up, what Hussman has missed.

601 2018-09-13 19:21:49 What? That other one hasn't been touched since 2006. The one that was reinstated is the one that was being used most recently. $DPBE is a real reinstatement in our opinion
602 2018-09-13 19:21:40 momo is in freefall  this is   >"the day stocks collapsed " i sold all my $AMD at 34 and will buy it back at 29.4 and then 28 if it holds 30  ill start to scale back in  but im at 50% cash here i don't like'em (90% stocks )
603 2018-09-13 19:20:00 well they haven’t kicked them out yet, but as we know they want to. It wasn’t until their stocks went down cube “changed” their minds and considering keeping them
604 2018-09-13 19:19:57 Your opioid epidemic has been a boon for your pharma stocks tho. But still won't budge on #legalizecannabis, eh? You've got a weird moral Liahona @CorporateJesus
605 2018-09-13 19:19:33 Exactly. To be that much of a coward as to say it to the news that it's officially decided, but then not say anything to their faces? THEN backtrack when stocks drop and hate floods in? Their CEO just exposed how sad that company really is. Cube deserves what they have coming.
606 2018-09-13 19:19:05 Quoting the Bible to those who are carnally minded is the same as telling a child about stocks & bonds.

616 2018-09-13 19:14:55 Just when your stocks went down, suddenly, the decision is not final yet? What's the game, Cube? 
#CubeIsCancelled
617 2018-09-13 19:14:22 They haven't kicked them out just yet. The company saw their stocks fall dramatically and faced backlash from fans so they came out with an article saying that they were still talking about the situation. I'm hoping they break the system and finally do away with this stupid shiz.
618 2018-09-13 19:13:25 cube knows damn well they woulda still been kickin them out if their stocks hadn’t dropped like dat. fuck them idc
619 2018-09-13 19:13:24 @megarush1024 if only. I can't help but feel this is wishful thinking specially the stocks options for congressists. That is how they get rich. Also, wish he'd introduced congress term limits

640 2018-09-13 19:03:39 Yea their stocks went downwards within minutes and then they realized what they had done. If that was me in their place, I would thank them and walk out the door. I just couldn't stay knowing how they really felt. I wish those two the best of luck.

670 2018-09-13 18:58:07 First off I didn't insult you in any way and if you continue the conversation ends. Secondly I'm not"misinformed" or "following" anything. I listened to the podcast and read the articles on Tesla stocks the next morning. These are my own thoughts. Regardless Elon suffered losses.
671 2018-09-13 18:57:49 If anyone on here buys stocks, buy stocks in Under Armour
672 2018-09-13 18:57:12 S&amp;P futures higher as China is open to trade talks and tech stocks rebound.
673 2018-09-13 18:57:09 They went back on their decision Cos they saw their stocks falling. Just another example of money hungry cowards.
674 2018-09-13 18:56:31 Robinhood allows you to trade stocks commission free. What’s stopping you from doing research and making money? Lazy entitled American kids. Y’all complain about opportunity but not opening any doors for yourself
675 2018-09-13 18:55:51 Cesar Chaves is doing a GREAT job, he is marching against the very UNFAIR Victoria Wines, who, by the way, has the LOWEST stocks in years. Despite all the opposition, Chaves will get farmers the RIGHTS they DESERVE. #makefarminggreatagain
676 2018-09-13 18:54:44 We are coming!! All product will be back on shelf by end of September. We are terribly sorry for all the wait. If you hadn't heard, we had some equipment failures in August which resulted in some out of stocks, but we are over the hump!
677 2018-09-13 18:54:31 +40years trading in the Stocks Mkts are the BEST accreditation, at least for me.
Failed tks to the FED a few years. Right. But I´m a veteran. I´m not a kid, like others. Bye, bye
678 2018-09-13 18:53:30 cube stocks dropping faster than my balls when i hit puberty 
679 2018-09-13 18:53:13 Two stocks I am concerned about is Hero Moto, ZEEL. Both are just breaking below 200EMA on weekly charts. Do trade them both with caution if buying them :)
680 2018-09-13 18:52:51 There's still a looming tax bill so they need to think about it.
They better not sell his equipment and memorabilia though!
Would love to know what stocks he was invested in.
681 2018-09-13 18:52:32 @cubeunited IF YOU REALLY THINK YOU CAN JUST BRING BACK EDAWN AND HYUNA BECAUSE YOU SAW YOUR STOCKS GOING DOWN, YOU’RE WRONG. YOU BETTER GIVE THEM SOMETHING TO COMEBACK. YALL ARE PATHETIC

Can someone translate that to korean and tag cube so they can read this #hyuna #edawn
682 2018-09-13 18:52:27 For many things in life, risk and reward are proportional. Risky stocks can have the highest potential reward. The riskiest dive has the highest points potential. Dangerous to trust and hope someone becomes your true love but the reward of finding that special person: priceless
683 2018-09-13 18:51:58 Stock mkt in general? Or just pot stocks?
684 2018-09-13 18:51:51 cube knew their stocks will flip if they kick them out lmaooooo thats what i call small dck energy
685 2018-09-13 18:51:36 Basically cube kicked out Hyuna and E’dawn without them knowing and once cube noticed their stocks dropped they said they are “still in discussion”
686 2018-09-13 18:51:21 They change their minds right after they saw their stocks plunge
687 2018-09-13 18:51:06 i always get so sad when I see stocks declining  i’m literally a nerdddd
688 2018-09-13 18:50:57 Can’t believe cube really went and tried to get rid of their biggest star and one of their best producers/male stars  and then saw their stocks plummeting and went “haha.. just kidding!” 
689 2018-09-13 18:50:38 But it does make sense that the natural result would be a drop on stocks. Idk if bpd is just arrogant or stupid. They're now stuck between a rock and a hard place smh.
690 2018-09-13 18:49:49 my dad made $50,000 profit trading stocks this morning all while we watched cooking shows and ate in n out and that’s what i wanna do in 30 years
691 2018-09-13 18:48:33 Bonsoir ma communauté 
Ce soir je pensais vous faire pleins de concours pour vider les stocks ça vous intéresse ? Seriez vous la ?
692 2018-09-13 18:47:36 Lmao they say their stocks goin low and stepped back smh
693 2018-09-13 18:47:04 it’s funny how @cubeunited Is so fucking money hungry that when they see that their stocks are dropping rapidly, they decide to no longer remove HyunA and E’Dawn from their fucking company. Pathetic.
694 2018-09-13 18:47:00 Hello Lisa! Thank you for your concerns but I have to share that amazon pays above minimum wage, an average of $15/hr (wages, bonus, stocks, matched 401k) Which in my case is enough to provided for myself and my two kids, Also I get my family medical benefits through amazon.
695 2018-09-13 18:46:53 It’s only bc their stocks plummeted
696 2018-09-13 18:46:00 cube saw their stocks dropping and shit themselves
697 2018-09-13 18:45:23 Should have known after elections stocks would plummet smh. Twitter and turtle Beach wya

701 2018-09-13 18:43:52 Cube thought they could pull a NikeXKapernick stunt and there stocks would either stay the same or rise but instead it plummeted and now they’re trying to do damage control because they thought people / fans would be on their side
702 2018-09-13 18:43:49 Cube said they can't trust Hyo and Hyuna but THEY'RE THE ONES THAT CAN'T TRUST CUBE ..they only want them back bc their stocks dropped
703 2018-09-13 18:43:25 How do ending stocks to use compare?
704 2018-09-13 18:43:20 Their stocks have already plummeted!!
705 2018-09-13 18:43:05 More tweets on trading stocks will be awesome.
706 2018-09-13 18:42:26 "Tremendous economic progress" is a weird way to say "giving corporations $1 trillion to buy back stocks and artificially inflate stock prices in the short term."
707 2018-09-13 18:42:22 @Blowster85 Hello dude, what stocks are you eyeing up? Out of curiosity.
708 2018-09-13 18:41:48 Selfies will be punished with time in the stocks; repeat offenders will be caned
709 2018-09-13 18:41:44 Besides China has a big stake in the USA (investments, products, stocks, properties etc) that it is to their benefit to fix their side of the tariff bargaining. The ball is in their court
710 2018-09-13 18:41:36 ahhh i see. i meant for stocks and things, not shitcoins. coinigy is my fav for looking at shitcoin exchanges but that bisq could be cool if it has a nice interface
711 2018-09-13 18:41:07 @cubeunited HYUNA AND EDAWN STAYS! WE ALL SAW WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR STOCKS! HYUNA SACRIFICED SO MUCH FOR YOU AND EDAWN WORKED SO HARD TO BECOME A PART OF PENTAGON IF THAT'S NOT TRUST I DONT KNOW WHAT IS

715 2018-09-13 18:40:17 I thought everyone was leaving for pot stocks.
716 2018-09-13 18:40:17 Cubes stocks must have dropped hella hard for them to kicked them out then also of a sudden say we aren’t kicking them out anymore. Y’all legit said you can’t trust them.

718 2018-09-13 18:39:27 The golden rule, treat others as you would want to be treated.

GOP: Lie to the masses struggling to make ends meet and give tax cuts to the ultra rich.  Take away safety nets for struggling Americans and let corporations buy back stocks and hide money overseas.
719 2018-09-13 18:39:03 their stocks dropped so low 
720 2018-09-13 18:39:00 That’s why it cost Nike billions and caused them to take the same wording and place it on a 9/11 ad. You are so lost I feel sorry for you. I think you should invest in stocks so we can take your money.
721 2018-09-13 18:38:56 enjoy the time with your little one.  That will turn any bad day in stocks into an overall good day anytime haha.  $OGRMF is taking one on the chin for me today, but im with you on the ride

726 2018-09-13 18:37:24 but yo apparently cube 'reconsidered' since stocks plummeted LOL
727 2018-09-13 18:37:21 can we get a live stream of cube stocks going down?
728 2018-09-13 18:37:11 Who cares what Tepper he owns? Where is he long? how many times do we see these hedge fund guys touting stocks. What's his performance ytd? Whats your performance ytd?

743 2018-09-13 18:33:36 Since they still neglect CLC and Pentagon's comeback is in the middle of all of this. Gidle is talented yes but they're still a rookie and won't be able to hold up the company even with BTOB too. CUBE lost their biggest source of income, their stocks are dropping significantly,
744 2018-09-13 18:33:33 Cube really f-ed this one up. Like they made a sudden move and their stocks dropped big time which is to be expected and now they are saying that they may change their mind. Its almost as if they want to punish the two of them but are fearful of the public...
745 2018-09-13 18:32:27 Cube is a big fat pussy idc. How can y’all go “sike” just because you saw your stocks plummet to hell. HyunA and E’dawn best pack their bags because they deserve so much better 
746 2018-09-13 18:31:47 Cube: Bye we don't own y'all anymore

755 2018-09-13 18:29:56 Lmao, haven't checked Twitter for 6 hours and now I'm seeing that Cube overturned their decision. Good fucking job but it would've been better had you not announced shit earlier that caused a massive uproar and stocks dropping.
756 2018-09-13 18:29:43 The regulator has already stated that all stocks are to be covered under physical settlement very soon
757 2018-09-13 18:29:39 Oh well i heard their stocks have crashed to the fucking floor so i guess its no longer our issue. Im sure they'll go to a company where they're actually appreciated 
758 2018-09-13 18:29:32 cube saw the stocks and said SIKE NVM
759 2018-09-13 18:29:05 One also probably has to ask what is cause of inflation? Is it fiat currency down- if so all prices rise - stocks up. In 1973 opec shock: all costs rise, margins fall: oil stocks rise, everything else falls.

766 2018-09-13 18:24:22 Lol it's clear they backtracked seeing their stocks falling + they can't unilaterally fire any employee , there's a reason why the Fair Trade commission exists. HH can sue them for wrongful termination.
767 2018-09-13 18:23:53 Indeed btob along with the og groups of cube is the hardcarry and backbone of the company. Gidle is getting a lot of attention and fanbase too which is nice. But since cube released the kicking out statement they began losing stocks and through that losing money
768 2018-09-13 18:23:21 There's legal and then there's sensible ... the French asked the Brits, having trashed local stocks, to wait until 1 Oct, but, being little englanders, they wanted to get in during the re-stocking season for French stocks and make easy money, leaving nothing for French.
769 2018-09-13 18:22:16 Actual wages are stagnant. Huge tax breaks to the top 2 % has only allowed co to buy back stocks. The deficit is rising 2 years faster than expected. You will crash the economy. You are inept at negotiating. What were people thinking. Vote 2018/2020
770 2018-09-13 18:21:47 500 million less corn ending stocks plus all the new bins built this year, there will be plenty of space to store soybeans.
771 2018-09-13 18:21:43 now they keep flip flopping saying oh no they aren't out, oh wait they are, oh no not yet.... biggest mess, jesus. seems like their stocks are speaking a tune they should have expected lmao.
772 2018-09-13 18:19:53 Oh no ! Your work is very useful ! I follow you in some of your trade. I want to learn to find stocks like yours
773 2018-09-13 18:19:35 Ah, thank goodness we live in an investment era when the Fed won't allow stocks to drop more than 5%! Those scary times are long gone! Thanks Bullard!
774 2018-09-13 18:19:32 markets are at the top end of their range, oversold stocks like $EEM and $SBUX are bouncing off oversold conditions which happens a day or two before $SPY pulls back

776 2018-09-13 18:19:03 Tobacco industry is less than 10% of the vape market btw. The cig manufacturer stocks sky rocketed today because they want to crack down on vaping, The number quit method in the US which is at minimum 95% healthier than cigarettes. Harm reduction for cigs work. Ask Sweden
777 2018-09-13 18:18:33 the SECOND they saw their stocks plummeting their “our trust cannot be regained” attitude really did a complete 180 huh?  you know what smell is, ladies?? the smell of pure bullshit !!!!!

780 2018-09-13 18:17:30 so cube isn’t kicking hyuna and hyo out LMAOOO they saw the stocks falling down and panicked
781 2018-09-13 18:17:06 I (Intelsat) looking nice. Already own some on the sim. About $1 below a new buy point. Outperforming 99% of stocks, outperforming 91% in it's own industry. This is a long term pick for me also setting up a potential nice trade.
782 2018-09-13 18:17:00 Cube : *kicks e'dawn and hyuna out*

Cube's stocks : *starts falling*

Cube : LMAOOO YOU GOT PRANKED LOOK AT ALL THE CAMERA'S WE GOT Y'ALL
783 2018-09-13 18:17:00 Nicotine is not the issue. Even the gum is over the counter. Problem is, it doesn’t work. Vaping marking tripled in 2013. Adult smoking saw its largest drops in last 20 years in 2014 and 2015. Tobacco industry stocks today gained $20 billion because of FDA announcement.
784 2018-09-13 18:16:58 Yes Some Stocks will rise with abrupt change.

792 2018-09-13 18:14:46 For anyone interested in making money off of stocks: don’t trade stocks unless you have $5,000 to spare. Learn stock options instead, start with $100, and you can have $1,000 within three months if you play it right.
793 2018-09-13 18:14:45 Not even with clear demand (from sold out stocks) and fans wanting to support Rob?
794 2018-09-13 18:14:28 Basically announced that they kicked Hyuna and e’dawn out of the company last night, but didn’t tell the two cuz they found out via news etc. then their stocks dropped -6.75% from it and now they’re basically going back on their words and saying that they haven’t been kicked out
795 2018-09-13 18:14:18 that's bc they saw their stocks dropping and realised that they need e'dawn and (mostly) hyuna more than these two need them 

hyuna's been carrying the company on her back for 10 years & they think they'll survive without her i HAD to laugh
796 2018-09-13 18:13:49 apple stocks rise by 20%.
797 2018-09-13 18:13:46 Good analogy bro!! A lot of people chAse stocks around in fomo. It’s good to set you limit price where u want it and let the litttle fishy come to u. So what if u miss it right
798 2018-09-13 18:13:19 Then they saw their stocks going down and suddenly they didn’t leave yet....Cube is disgusting and cancelled :D
799 2018-09-13 18:12:44 I know it's crazy. Shes the one who's kept the company afloat throughout most of their downfalls. It's funny watching them try to backtrack after their stocks plummeted.

803 2018-09-13 18:11:43 i hope their stocks stay down
804 2018-09-13 18:11:28 after the initial statement, stocks plummented and they said they’ll have an official meeting next week, i guess next week became today cuz stocks dropped like 6%
805 2018-09-13 18:11:25 and they got the result— their stocks dropped rapidly for the past few hours when they released news of them kicking those two
806 2018-09-13 18:11:22 rip ur stocks hun
807 2018-09-13 18:10:58 they saw the stocks going down sksjdks the pettiness and greediness jumped out
808 2018-09-13 18:10:36 yes y a des gens qui disent que la cube est revenue sur sa décision :/ ces rats ils ont vu leurs stocks dégringoler ils ont changé d’avis
809 2018-09-13 18:09:48 How about full #BanForeignOwnership .  Homes are for living not investments.  Our homes are being traded as commodity stocks by foreign interests.  It’s killing communities and people are moving out of Lower Mainland.  Ghost neighbourhoods, homeless and junkies left behind.
810 2018-09-13 18:09:13 there were articles released & other statements last night saying that the decision wasn't actually final & that they were "considering the opinions of their other artists" etc. my guess is that they changed their mind after seeing fan outrage + their stocks falling lol
811 2018-09-13 18:09:08 OK, so in other words, something's happening that's driving the real yields on USTs higher. One thing that might cause this is the expectation of a booming economy, leading to portfolio substitution out of bonds into stocks. But this is not likely a fiscal crisis scenario.
812 2018-09-13 18:08:34 stocks went down they were yelling timber
813 2018-09-13 18:08:33 $SNDZ holding some ; got very very small volume these days...a low float if something comes up, it could be a good one imo
814 2018-09-13 18:08:17 Folks I speak to wont own it due to the bailout. If it were named Fred's Motors and had the same metrics it would do better. Also doesnt help that in this market high cash flow high dividend stocks are red headed step children. Every wants no profit  and "potential". And FAANG

820 2018-09-13 18:06:45 so. are we back to official ot10 pentagon bc cube dont want their stocks to drop......

822 2018-09-13 18:05:47 I might trade on wrong stocks...and lose all my money
823 2018-09-13 18:05:46 cube apparently didn't even TELL hyuna she was getting kicked out but she saw the stocks falling and found out herself,,,,, cube get ur fucking act together you deserve NONE of ur artists.
824 2018-09-13 18:05:19 cube was like "sike" when they saw their stocks plummet
825 2018-09-13 18:04:37 With fantasy & stocks think short term so much can happen over  a long period
826 2018-09-13 18:04:23 cubes stocks r going kokobop down down baby
827 2018-09-13 18:04:12 Bet light sweet crude kills salmon too as well as gasoline, diesel, raw sewage, silt, and low returning fish stocks from over fishing on a commercial level state all the facts and dont cherry pick the one that suits your delusional war on resources
828 2018-09-13 18:04:05 So I recently decided to start investing in stocks, and I just made $20  #imfuckingrichnow #hateuscauseyouaintus 
829 2018-09-13 18:03:54 Who wants to bet that Cube decided to not kick them out because they saw their stocks drop within 5 minutes of the word getting out?
830 2018-09-13 18:03:39 People who can afford stocks are doing great.  But earnings and buying power are flat for 95% of Americans.  Yet prices rose.  Deficit spending has skyrocketed.  You are creating a balloon that is due to pop 5 minutes after you are out of office.
831 2018-09-13 18:03:22 there's no valuing the weed stocks, all float and momentum.
832 2018-09-13 18:03:14 Wait until I start advertising everywhere and teaching people to buy the opening print on random low float stocks!! : ) I'll be so RICH!!
833 2018-09-13 18:03:10 “Oh Jenise, we gotta get to the money. You got any stocks?” — my supervisor
834 2018-09-13 18:02:27 ya, they buy 7M shares of a companies at (.0325-.035) even though shares never traded there on ANY volume all at .02-.025. LOL. Liar! Then they claim they have too many stocks (penny ones) to keep an accurate figure. LOL. Ya, BIG money! LOL. Free paper trading! #joefraud
835 2018-09-13 18:02:14 If you use a product, invest in it.
Example 
Spotify $10 month. 
But past 4 months stocks have risen 36%. 
Make the people that made the game regret it by beating them :)
836 2018-09-13 18:01:53 These stocks I invested in . Can’t wait to cop some land before this year over!! Less talk more investing
837 2018-09-13 18:01:41 invented stocks
838 2018-09-13 18:01:36 smh they saw their stocks droppin n they backtracked so quick
839 2018-09-13 18:01:33 when they saw the reaction + the way their stocks dropped, they wanted to do a switch up lmao.
840 2018-09-13 18:01:15 Cube saw their stocks dying and the internet hating them and realize they hold the company by the balls so they kept them
841 2018-09-13 18:01:14 Iceland and Norway didn't join the EEC/EU in large part because they knew that their fishing stocks and industry would die once it became a free for all. Leaving the #EU was the right battle to expend energies on... not rearranging Titanic deckchairs
842 2018-09-13 18:01:09 What if my plan is buying the dips on momentum stocks? Is that just an overall obvious strategy? It used to work but it’s wiping me out now. Took A 20% loss today. Wanting more than being up 60$
843 2018-09-13 18:00:58 LMAOOOO cube saw their stocks decreasing and thought twice about kickin our hyuna and hyojong. i just have to laugh
844 2018-09-13 18:00:58 and they had the audacity to say in their first OFFICIAL statement that they discussed with them but decided to kick them out, but after seeing stocks drop they changed their words and say decision isnt final, now even the pple involved werent informed. cube is such a fcking liar
845 2018-09-13 18:00:44 cube: hyuna and edawn are out 
stocks: *drop* 
cube: woAh woAh woAh did we say out???? nahhhhh we meant MAYBE #CubeIsCancelled
846 2018-09-13 18:00:41 It’s also related nt declaring 2 LHDN d source of income. U can’t just rcv money from any tom dick n harry without valid documentation. Even u sell stocks overseas, whn wire transfer, the bank will query. Evrything hs procedures if nt hanky panky including illegal funding wl hpn
847 2018-09-13 18:00:40 lmaoo the saw their stocks n said sike we need the money
848 2018-09-13 17:59:47 Nope. Have u seen their stocks after they kicked them out?
849 2018-09-13 17:59:45 Yes I hate the tax refund the booming economy my stocks rising - winning in general
850 2018-09-13 17:59:33 And we DID and loaded right back up again! Quick money FOOL! What kind of a fool preaches long-term investments on Stocks under $.10 on the CSE LOL long term on $ati $aol $sqg OMG I tried to give you the benefit of the doubt man but you’re just foolish!
851 2018-09-13 17:59:27 dropping as fast as my grades in economics.... that’s why I have no clue what “the stocks are dropping” means lol
852 2018-09-13 17:59:19 Stocks are public you clown, just buy them and make money as well if it's so easy.
853 2018-09-13 17:59:06 cube looked at their stocks and decided to get them back!
854 2018-09-13 17:59:05 cube: you’re not part of us
hyo and hyuna: alright by-
cube: wait our stocks come back
855 2018-09-13 17:59:03 Again that worth is in stock. There’s nothing to pay taxes on when you don’t actually have that money in the bank. Are you suggestion people should start paying taxes on stocks that haven’t been cashed in or sold yet?

857 2018-09-13 17:58:10 they saw their stocks falling and said nvm i hope hyuna and hyojong leave by themselves bc cube obviously stands by their money rather than their artists
858 2018-09-13 17:58:02 Quick man, ask them what other stocks they like!
859 2018-09-13 17:57:41 #trending #stocks #trading #finance added $VVUS
860 2018-09-13 17:57:40 cube said "take backsies we made a mistake uwu we're not kicking E'Dawn and Hyuna out after all" after seeing their stocks fucking plummet through the ground
861 2018-09-13 17:56:54 But stocks and other equities aren't goods. They're representative ownership stakes in an entity. In this case, fair means everyone operating with the same information. Free insider trading is like betting on a sports game when you've already seen the score. 1/
862 2018-09-13 17:56:42 cube likely didn't opt to keep them bcuz they genuinely wanted to, they probably noticed public outcry & their stocks taking a dive lmao. piece of shit company just like all the others
863 2018-09-13 17:56:36 HAHAHA CUBE REALLY SAW STOCKS DROP AND WERE LIKE FUCK NEVERMIND WE JUST PLAYIN
864 2018-09-13 17:55:42 Anil ji has been bullish on Sugar since past 1 year and has added positions as well. Stocks are at 52 week low. Unless fossil fuel in not replaced entirely by enthnol very difficult for him to make be in the money in next 1 year.
865 2018-09-13 17:55:41 @stocks is fun yo
866 2018-09-13 17:55:23 lmfao cube quaking after their stocks dropped n realized they werent gonna make it wo hyuna
867 2018-09-13 17:55:08 so I'm guessing the CEO didn't expect this much of a negative reaction from the inetz and is trying to fix it because their stocks dropped worse than when the dating news came out after they announced they kicked them out.
868 2018-09-13 17:54:35 i can say that cube is being so unprofessional. i mean you dont just say you’re kicking out or firing your artists and letting the said artists find out through the news then stocks plummet and suddenly cube be like wait we’re still considering, nothing has been confirmed
869 2018-09-13 17:54:35 I did not infer that there are markets where all stocks are up. I am not a child and I now make a good living in the markets, with the best returns in ETF's, MLP's and REITS.
870 2018-09-13 17:54:24 Everyone can see the true colors of Cube Ent with this whole issue. It's like they don't make decisions carefully. They announce they're kicking out Edawn and Hyuna and then backtrack hours later saying they're still talking about it? Bitch saw their stocks drop and did ctrl+z.
871 2018-09-13 17:54:24 hyuna really is THAT bitch she really put the weight of the company on her back, and then had said company disrespect her and her spouse, firing BOTH and ON TOP OF THAT had the company crawling back to her bc the stocks overwhelmingly decreased. wow.
872 2018-09-13 17:54:11 John at least tell people where QE money went - into financial services ie. Non- productive activity rather than direct into the real economy. It had very little affect at all - except property values raised+ stocks/share prices were fuelled helping the rich 2 get richer.
873 2018-09-13 17:53:38 lmaooo they saw their stocks lowering and fans rioting lolololol
874 2018-09-13 17:53:31 Lmao they saw their stocks dropping and pulled that excuse out of their asses real quick
875 2018-09-13 17:53:30 Ms.Young deleted google and I am now the queen of DuckDuckGo why do they think they’re fooling anyone
People that buy stocks with these companies should think again
876 2018-09-13 17:53:07 $tlry..Amazing. Stocks goes up and the out of the money October puts have doubled from the opening. Usually means stocks is going to sell off.
877 2018-09-13 17:52:52 Tilray shits on all the weed stocks and I thought that company was lass the aph crazy
878 2018-09-13 17:52:22 Lmao my stocks are long term. Not fly by night like $FAT $SX $CYBX
879 2018-09-13 17:52:21 if cube really told hyuna and edawn they arent removed just bc stocks dropped ....... they are truly THE pussy ent company they really will just do whatever the gp tells them to do  how sad
880 2018-09-13 17:52:05 cube really saw how their stocks were going down and got insecure oopsie

885 2018-09-13 17:50:52 About half the stocks I track are actually down today -- more action in the beaten-down names than anything else.
886 2018-09-13 17:50:36 Cube is shaking at their plummeting stocks rn 
887 2018-09-13 17:50:33 Cube really needed to see the stocks go down to realize that kicking Hyuna out was the begining of theor end. Hyuna honey, just leave that shit. You carried that company for to long
888 2018-09-13 17:49:27 cube can bring them back but it won’t bring their stocks back i have to laugh

914 2018-09-13 17:43:13 Nobody apparently, since their stocks plummeted as soon as the first news got out, but they had been getting lots of backlash from "fans" because of them being a couple.

This is just stuff I found on twitter tho, since I don't follow either of those artists.

*netz fly into a rage, stocks begin to fall dramatically*

cube: on second thought 'fire' is a strong word......

Got and got, unfortunately. I think I've got a swap of the @SUFC_tweets (original labelling). I think I had a swap of the @LeTour one as well, but it got utilised when stocks ran low.

943 2018-09-13 17:34:28 You know when you panic lie and everyone knows you're lying? That reminds me of Cube, suddenly saying they are thinking and talking about it with the idols when HyunA nor E'Dawn even knew about it. C'mon just admit you saw your stocks and panicked lmao

950 2018-09-13 17:32:11 I am sure that family owned business are doing this but big businesses did buy back stocks to raise their value.  That is not investing in their workers in any way. Sadly that was the promise and many employees depended on their employers just to get nothing except a bonus.

956 2018-09-13 17:29:54 This is not the norm as more corps bought back stocks and ran with the $ !
957 2018-09-13 17:29:41 saying cube is gonna go bankrupt without hyuna isnt even a diss at g-idle or btob its just the truth. look at their fucking stocks falling into hell LMAO
958 2018-09-13 17:29:16 Cube saying they removed Hyuna and Hyojong and then taking it back once they saw their stocks is far more embarrassing and puts them in a worse light than when they just up and denied Hyuna and Hyojong’s relationship without consulting them in the first place.

Now that they see stocks dropping they’re supposedly still ‘discussing’.

1096 2018-09-13 16:48:03 they saw their stocks PLUMMET and rain for the hills
1097 2018-09-13 16:48:02 maybe if the 1975 were under cube, their stocks wouldn't be dropping.
1098 2018-09-13 16:48:01 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to improve your depression
1099 2018-09-13 16:47:57 Agree... If one can correctly identify "misprising" in stocks, then may use them for long term investment while understanding its risks.

1103 2018-09-13 16:47:30 Hell, even STOCK HOLDERS were pissed off at their decision and their stocks dropped drastically. I can only imagine how upset their artists are. I really hope the boys are holding up okay.... :(
1104 2018-09-13 16:47:22 i chalk it up as good for the space. it reinforces the conservative investor's idea that all weed stocks are scammy hype with no substance to back them up.

Hyuna and edawn are not there only artists!
The rest of Pentagon is going to suffer. Also a chance that it will harm BTOB, (G)-ilde and CLC and more

1121 2018-09-13 16:42:09 I did they're scrambling to save their stocks lol
1122 2018-09-13 16:42:04 And hyuna is winning! In a sense. I mean just look at their stocks after they announced they "kicked" them out of the company. I think Cube forgets who the one person was that kept them relevant and even promoted their other artist better than Cube themself. Lol
1123 2018-09-13 16:41:34 did i just see a pentagon pic acct cheering about cube’s stocks goin down  sweetie they’re still employed under cube you know that right

1126 2018-09-13 16:40:56 cube retracting their announcement on them kicking hyuna and edawn out is bullshit, they're only retracting it because they lost a fuck ton of stocks. lmao and now they're saying that "nothing is final", you already announced it on your sns accs cube. you have to fucking own up-

1140 2018-09-13 16:36:33 Mmmm hmmm! I heard they were still discussing it because their stocks are dropping like flies
1141 2018-09-13 16:36:19 Drawing a speculative conclusion here but seems these stocks will act much like the spirits (beer and liquor) company stocks in a downturn. They should be good defensives when fear and anxiety rises.
1142 2018-09-13 16:36:15 Yeah...lol. The Nigerian stock market is easily not for the faint of heart. Smh. Sadly, a handful of stocks did prop up the market for close to a decade. Still got a long way to go.
1143 2018-09-13 16:36:10 Hyunah literally carries them their stocks are crashing downwards. And I thought they already released and official statement but I saw another article saying they weren’t sure yet lol might’ve changed they kinda after seeing the money drop

1150 2018-09-13 16:33:02 now cube wants hyuna and edawn back because of how fast their stocks dropped???? lmao better off for the 2 artists to NOT COME BACK TO CUBE AT ALL
1151 2018-09-13 16:32:54 cube were so FAST in changing their statement when they saw their stocks drop down

1180 2018-09-13 16:25:12 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Cube saw those stocks plummet and got scared so recalled the final decision. Cube are a buncha snakes.
1181 2018-09-13 16:24:17 @Architectsuk Hey social team. Any idea if there's a stockist of Architects merch in Brighton? Figured there must be somewhere close to home that stocks their stuff, no?
1182 2018-09-13 16:23:50 cube saw their stocks drop and said SIKE we were joking
1183 2018-09-13 16:23:23 I think the only reason cube said the decision is not finalised is coz they saw the stocks drop..to make things worse they didnt even inform hyuna and hyojong abt being kicked out. So unprofessional....
1184 2018-09-13 16:23:07 Trump is not the reason the economy is good. The monthly job #’s are same as 2016, 2015. Unemployment is globally low & was mid 4’s & falling when he started. Stocks were 18k & rising. 
This is like hopping out of a limo the last 1/2 mile of a marathon & then claiming you won.

1191 2018-09-13 16:20:08 #Stocks,#Indexes NDX top signal is unambiguously low fidelity.  No change in our NDX long position.  No signal whatsoever from SPX; we remain long SPX also.

Good balance sheet.  Good growth potential.  Could branch out. Higher risk. Could have volatility.  #stocks #investing

1197 2018-09-13 16:19:15 This is cube seeing the stocks plummeting and trying to backpedal
1198 2018-09-13 16:19:07 The action in Financial stocks is maddening. On bad days, no change, good days, no change. Like watching paint dry. The earnings growth is there, rev growth too: sector exp earnings growth +46% in q3 '18, 28% in Q4. Rev gro 7% in q2 '18, +3.3% exp in q3 '18. O/weight sector.
1199 2018-09-13 16:18:50 Nice write up Ben.  On the year - almost all my positive P/L positions are ETFs, no ETFs are down on the year, and ALL losers on the year are individual stocks. With 500 some ETFs, Do you have a list of ETFs with liquid options you trade? (miss you on the follow page btw)

1203 2018-09-13 16:18:27 Good call, I am starting to see the CSE stocks move and they usually move at the end of the run. Lets hope for one more good push into legalization
1204 2018-09-13 16:18:10 If they made less optimal capital allocation decisions (holding excess cash in a low interest rate environment) or paying down debt (effectively reducing a short exposure to low interest rates) then no... stocks probably wouldn’t have done as well.
1205 2018-09-13 16:18:07 Now that Cube's stocks have plummeted, Hyuna is probably in a meeting as we speak getting her demands met. Her and Hyojong will date publicly, a full length Triple H album and Hyojong will be involved with Pentagon's current comeback.
1206 2018-09-13 16:17:59 Limited number (c24) were bought for Task Force Black in and around Baghdad. At the time it was a vehicle that could be delivered very quickly from Australian stocks. It had a RWS on as well.
No more were ordered...Cougar's got the nod after that.
1207 2018-09-13 16:17:28 In this context, Bogle is referring to speculative investing, trying to time the market, buying individual stocks. All require more effort than passively investing in index funds...and none manage to outperform the passive

It was disgusting. Report that and it was shown here the pics of it.
1217 2018-09-13 16:15:31 yeahhhhh they released a statement abt kicking e'dawn and hyuna from the company because "they cant trust them" but then their stocks went down Massively so they released another one saying it's "yet to be finalized" and there's gonna be a meeting next week :)))))
1218 2018-09-13 16:15:26 CUBE LITERALLY WOULD BE BANKRUPT BY NOW WITHOUT HYUNA apparently their stocks dropped so much they're tryna backtrack

1222 2018-09-13 16:14:42 This is a perfect example. Markets near all time highs and lots of money still on the sidelines. Climbing that wall of worry. Good signs its still early in a long trend that wants to go longer. @cnbc #stocks

HyunA & E’dawn: bye bitches 
*stocks went down*
Cube: oh,,comeback!!

Artist should not be treated this way. They are both happy and they’re already in the right age to date. Fuck all those haters!!!!!
1238 2018-09-13 16:11:25 cube backtracked on their decision after stocks dropped, they're having a meeting to decide if they rly wanna go through with this or not later
1239 2018-09-13 16:11:19 Not even the beginning. Exactly.  This latest NR has me pumped and laughing at the same time. Laughing because a lot of people are so focused on the weed stocks they’re about to miss a many multiple bag run in the coming months. 
1240 2018-09-13 16:11:03 If/when the markets do head toward correction territory... the FOMO garbage/frenzy stocks like $TSLA will be the first to go. And it won't be pretty

1242 2018-09-13 16:10:58 they fucked up big time and regretted after stocks went down yikes, hyuna deserves better
1243 2018-09-13 16:10:32 cube reconsidering their statement on hyuna and hyojong after their stocks drop dramatically is sending me .. like how y’all just now realize that y’all are nothing without hyuna and hyojong
1244 2018-09-13 16:10:21 //Oh man. They’re stocks would probably only rise even further and I think WWE would get more bonus points for allowing their wrestlers to partake in such events.
1245 2018-09-13 16:10:19 they've since taken back their statement like "well... not actually, not yet" after their stocks dropped massively :/
1246 2018-09-13 16:10:07 Both dollar & bond markets dwarf the size of the stock market.  They will choose those.  Plus you can always jawbone stocks while propping the other two to minimize the damage, so they can chose 2.5 / 3 options 
1247 2018-09-13 16:10:06 Liquidity is perilous and it really shouldn't be.
If they can't raise for some reason then the story can end quickly.
I have also seen stocks carry absurd valuations for ages.
The only guaranteed killer for the stock price is poor sales.
1248 2018-09-13 16:09:35 fuck Netflix and chill, im all for watching the stocks for cube crash and chill

1252 2018-09-13 16:06:46 Tbh me too. I feel bad for the idols under cube but i really hope this company got a huge slap in the face (have u seen that apparently the decision isnt final... they released the statement after the drop in their stocks!)
1253 2018-09-13 16:06:42 I agree with your stocks idea, that would thwart their little egos

1288 2018-09-13 15:59:53 cz their stocks dropped drastically so im guessing they want those two back.. i hope they dont come back and leave and make their own company
1289 2018-09-13 15:59:48 They were not officially "kicked" out in the first place. CUBE may have seen the stocks go down, and made the statement saying that they are having a board meeting week about the matter
1290 2018-09-13 15:59:42 True... more than a few have shared recently that they’ve noticed a difference in Google restricting conservative searches. Concerned, I sold Google & FB stocks two months ago. No regrets.
1291 2018-09-13 15:59:33 @neophtrade If you don't have a list of stocks earnings season is a good time to start. Look for the best of the best in many sectors.
1292 2018-09-13 15:59:20 Ok..there is no doubt fcu is underperforming in a big way. Sometimes a stock can just not get any love for whatever reason. From a trading perspective (not necessarily an investment perspective) its better to focus on stocks that move when the industry moves.

Check her stocks out, you might find something you love. Thanks.
1303 2018-09-13 15:54:27 That's always wrong at 2 times in a cycle. Stocks have it wrong at the tops and at the bottoms where they chase momentum of the time. I suspect this is one of those times. They're bullish until the day of the collapse (1929, 87, 00, 08 and other times). Will know soon enough.

1305 2018-09-13 15:54:04 Trump just stole 1.5 trillion dollars from 99% of us to give to the top 1% who don't need it. For those who wonder why the Dow is so high, that's it. They are buying their stocks back. Artificial inflation of the stock market. The deficit is triple that which Obama had.

1324 2018-09-13 15:49:09 Depends on the tuition and the person but I’d rather own 2 stocks than have our corporate overlords own those same 2 stocks instead
1325 2018-09-13 15:48:50 They saw them stocks dropping sis!!! Lol
1326 2018-09-13 15:48:47 Sir, here we will get data of stocks which hit 52 week high on that day but if I want 52wk high price for all the stocks. How to get it
1327 2018-09-13 15:48:04 hyuna taking her stocks with her? a whole new mood
1328 2018-09-13 15:47:10 The only reason cube is reconsidering kicking them out is because their stocks dropped when they announced that they're leaving.

1330 2018-09-13 15:46:46 ... llevaría a tomar más deuda (hoy los mercados están cerrados) o al no poder ajustar por precio (TC) un brutal ajuste por stocks (empleo) lo que haría caer aún más la recaudación y agrandaría el ya brutal déficit. Argentina está condenada.

1335 2018-09-13 15:45:47 i think cube is tryin to backtrack the whole “we kicked them out” news since they stocks dropped like rite after but like at this point i have nooo idea
1336 2018-09-13 15:45:33 in terms of business cube knows their stocks would drop immensely if they even came close to kicking hyuna out and universes would never allow hyojong leaving too let's all stay calm and wait for further news
1337 2018-09-13 15:45:07 That would make sense regarding PR. However for locals and stuff id imagine it almost all being ultimate. Assuming we can play items off with stocks in the demo. It gets a little dicey if the demo is the e3 build.
1338 2018-09-13 15:44:59 Yung stocks ng Cube Ent. bumagsak na kaya biglang bawi ng unang announcement hahahaha
1339 2018-09-13 15:44:32 I plan on Shorting or selling short on $FXI (Large Cap Chinese Companies). Might possibly be a great way to hedge investments against trade deals and tariffs against China that could potentially harm US stocks in the short term.
1340 2018-09-13 15:44:12 That's really funny because I've seen some China stocks increase because those companies are NOT relying on or making deals with the U.S. China does NOT need to come crawling back on it's knees to the U.S. for trade deals. In fact, China has the power to destroy the U.S. economy.
1341 2018-09-13 15:43:39 did cube hint at hyuna and edawn leaving to see what would happen to their stocks before making the final decision? Hope they learned. Cuz now im confused on where theyre at
1342 2018-09-13 15:43:22 Stocks discount the future. Equity markets have already discounted q2 & q3 earnings. That's why the market has been in a high level consolidation since January but it's breaking out. My guess is the Fed pauses after Sept hike.
1343 2018-09-13 15:43:18 Sold all my $CPG stocks at 10% gain now in $NIO at 7.35- to the moon we go
1344 2018-09-13 15:43:00 Sooo Cube changed their mind bc they saw their stocks were dropping? Lmao they care that much about money. You're still cancelled, @cubeunited. The danage has been done.
1345 2018-09-13 15:41:59 Today is predicable as Trump rally dies because as I have said many times FADE's goal is Status Quo so oil getting hit, gold capped, stocks fading (Russell 2,000 down) Bonds up. #sigh

The chart of Bhart Forge looks good.

One can buy at the current price [662-663] for the possible target of 690  in a week time. Stop loss can be placed at 645.

Logic: RSI,MACD ,ADX (14) are giving buy signal .
           Stock is above 20 DMA

1350 2018-09-13 15:41:14 They saw that they may had made a mistake with it when they saw the stocks drop a ton.
1351 2018-09-13 15:40:47 Im cracking up that in a span of 24 hrs cube has kicked Hyuna and Edawn out for their relationship

And then quickly backtracked with "we aren't finished discussing it yet" after their stocks dropped 

Im not really too into Hyuna and Pentagon but like dont do them dirty man

1359 2018-09-13 15:37:46 $CLF healthy consolidation. Newly released short interest shows an increase to 42 million shares short. $CLF didn't quite get new highs at the open. Stocks don't get this close to new highs with printing them.

1365 2018-09-13 15:36:37 You can drive yourself crazy watching stocks you hate outperform your portfolio. Take them off your screen. It's destructive. Focus on your process and where you need to evolve. If the businesses you own are performing the market will eventually come back to them.
1366 2018-09-13 15:36:01 This is what I mean by corruption in PR.  There probably are stocks of other supplies hidden around by local politicians then they go the new and piss and moan about Trump's support. BS.

1369 2018-09-13 15:35:47 Look it up. This so-called economic boom didn’t happen over the last 20 months alone. Stocks have been soaring.
1370 2018-09-13 15:35:13 Cube released a statement saying that they kicked them both out because of “trust” and their stocks dropped so hard that now they’re backtracking their statement but the artists found out about being kicked out thru those articles.

*stocks drop drastically*

Cube : Lol April fools guys issa joke chill we still thinking about it 
1391 2018-09-13 15:30:52 just invested more money into my stocks 
1392 2018-09-13 15:30:45 Because their stocks dropped so fast and the world wide backlash hit them harder than an angry mom armed with kimchi.
1393 2018-09-13 15:30:40 lmaoooo. i hope they tell them exactly where to stick it. only reason they're ~rethinking~ is because their stocks are falling.
1394 2018-09-13 15:30:14 Some stocks slow movers 
Some are fast 
Some are slow fast both 

There is a key to see how they will run 

In coming future and buy them 

I have suffered loss of capital too and some are still below my buy price

1400 2018-09-13 15:28:48 I wouldn't want Hyuna to stay in cube even if she wasn't kicked out. I mean, they are obviously doing it bcuz of their stocks and they are only using her as a bait. 

I'm sorry for E'dawn though. He worked so hard to produce all those music and all he got back is "you are out."
1401 2018-09-13 15:28:29 cube’s stocks went down so much that’s what u get when ur a dumb BITCH
1402 2018-09-13 15:28:13 Business people are not dumb. They know when the stocks go up so they played the timing card which got people talking about Nike. Its not a hard concept to understand. They were in a win win situation no matter how it played out.

1426 2018-09-13 15:20:50 cube: ok were officially kicking out edawn and hyuna

1457 2018-09-13 15:12:20 Totally agree. we are in a newsflow period. plenty more to come.

1474 2018-09-13 15:08:32 I hope hyuna leaves anyway she deserves better. They only backtracked because they saw their stocks drop
1475 2018-09-13 15:08:24 I’m not going to win you over. But did you sell your home in advance? Or not buy one expecting a crisis? Or short financial stocks?  I ask genuinely. Because if you are right that “everyone” knew, they would have done those things, especially the insiders.
1476 2018-09-13 15:08:11 Except for a few things; the internet even it's more infant stages was useful (re: usenet groups), it was accessible and cheap/free (re: universities), and the stocks were publicly traded.  THAT is Trust.  Sure, 'overpriced?' but have you see $BTC bubble pop?  $100 to $20K??
1477 2018-09-13 15:08:10 Backtracked after their stocks took a dive

1485 2018-09-13 15:07:10 And that’s exactly why I started investing more in the stock market and buying stocks from companies and try to get big time shares from them as well. And also when you work you sacrifice a lot of time and years and job does not get you to Financial independence as well.
1486 2018-09-13 15:06:32 Which Stocks Would Be Ideal?
1487 2018-09-13 15:06:27 Cube definitely saw their stocks dropping and had to reconsider letting hyuna pipe down her man under their company name.
1488 2018-09-13 15:05:48 Fuckin wit the stocks yo where should I put my money ?
1489 2018-09-13 15:05:40 If forced to split the universe into growth and value evenly, what would you do? Maybe that’s the issue. You can’t simply have half the universe be “good” stocks and half “bad”. Interesting, active managers AS A WHOLE have been challenged vs both (not a good look).

1510 2018-09-13 14:59:19 ok not to be that person but cube’s stocks didn’t drop That Much
1511 2018-09-13 14:58:24 I'm just lying here on the sofa laughing at how pathetic and ridiculous #CUBE is for spouting nonsense and then backtracking just because they saw how much their stocks fell.

1543 2018-09-13 14:51:33 And if you think this trade war is over any time soon, wake up, you're dreaming. Only a #crash in stocks followed by a #Fed reversal in policy will signal a peak dollar, and more importantly, peak USD/CNY, "then" we can be confident #Gold has bottomed imho.

1564 2018-09-13 14:44:55 I am really cackling at how cube said they are "reconsidering" their decision about hyuna and edawn after their stocks dropped. Their intentions are so clear. Cube is so pathetic actually.

1571 2018-09-13 14:43:49 lets not pretend cube saying "the final decision not being made" has anything to do with hyuna and edawn personally as artists and human beings but has EVERYTHING to do with the backlash they received and their stocks fucking plummeting
1572 2018-09-13 14:43:43 I see this as a similar scenario to stocks splitting - more people can afford the price and current stockholders get double the shares for being early adopters.
1573 2018-09-13 14:43:35 They forgot what actually earns them money. Or I should say, who. Their top earner was always hyuna. Edawn is a keystone of Pentagon, their second high earner. The stocks plummeted so sidusHQ probably broke Asian on the heads of Cube.

But I am glad she is calm abt it. I had always reminded her not to invest what she is not willing to lose, bc risky
1603 2018-09-13 14:36:41 They shouldn’t have bitten the hand that fed them for so long. As a result cube’s stocks took a dive. Hopefully they keep dropping and the groups all file to leave the company :)))

1708 2018-09-13 14:12:33 They told Hyuna and E-Dawn were kicked out but now they see their stocks falling, they changed their mind so fast.
The power of money.
1709 2018-09-13 14:12:29 Ok. I saw yr tweet very late last night. 
Felt stupid. 
Decided to learn it.
Struggled.
Finally, figured it out .(I think) :-) At 5 am. 
So thank you. 
Now I see that pharma stocks are all komu cloud BOs.
1710 2018-09-13 14:11:35 It’s just the loud 39%. If stocks were still down they’d still be talking about it but they can’t use it so it’s gone now. All his base ever does is spin what they can and if there’s nothing to spin, make it up. Create fake news and pretend the other side creates fake news.
1711 2018-09-13 14:11:24 $NXPI $MU $QCOM for all these SEMI stocks i wonder if we have seen the low yesterday already. With all clever analysts now downgraded them at the low - it would be their usual perfect timing. And missing to see huge new market with electric cars ...
1712 2018-09-13 14:11:15 do you realize those numbers you are bragging about are how the rich people is doing? not how the middle class and low class? they do not own stocks or companies.

1715 2018-09-13 14:11:01 I agree, and since most corrections are just that - a correction, stop start markets can be very frustrating indeed. So its very important to not sell stocks that are performing OK even when the market in general turns down. I just don't add to exposure during these times.
1716 2018-09-13 14:10:55 do half these people retweeting cube’s stocks & posting screenshots of them declining even know what it means LOL

1735 2018-09-13 14:06:45 They're such pussies!  Now that they've seen how much their stocks have fallen, they realized their mistake and try to make amends by saying nothing's decided yet about Hyuna's and Hyojong's situation. They're just so dumb, it makes me sick. 
1736 2018-09-13 14:06:32 Watch their stocks plummet even more lmao

1741 2018-09-13 14:05:06 I saw somewhere that their stocks dropped real bad after the news. Did you rt that haha
But yeah, Hyuna would be able to make a name for herself but it think it might be a little harder for E'Dawn plus I think he's quite involved with Pentagon's music.
This is just terrible la

1761 2018-09-13 14:00:47 Just to clarify, I'm cautious when I see a market with just a small number of stocks moving up. I want to see depth. In my early years I got scared out of the market watching major indexes hitting lows and I would miss leaders emerging off the lows.

1832 2018-09-13 13:43:38 The worst part about owning stocks is knowing how much you could’ve made if you invested more
1833 2018-09-13 13:43:16 Happy that I sell my stocks and made cash, after 3-4 days once it clears up I will buy stocks again :)

1836 2018-09-13 13:42:38 cube retracting their statement after their stocks fell just proves they really don’t care about their artists, just the money
1837 2018-09-13 13:42:29 And I’d have more money if my Social Security money was invested in stocks. What’s your point?
1838 2018-09-13 13:42:17 Could you explain how that vol profile helps you? As far as I can see all it really tells you is that a shit load was done at the opening price (kinda obvious in most stocks most of the time no?)
1839 2018-09-13 13:42:17 Sirji... I need your eyeopener advise to basic things to learn/use in this scanner to pick the stocks as its looks lengthy file & little confusing for me
1840 2018-09-13 13:41:08 Bighit would never stoop so low but yeah fans need to keep themselves in check for sure. @cubeunited you suck, may your stocks continue to plummet.
1841 2018-09-13 13:41:07 I make more money a day trading stocks than I do working a week at my part time......

1846 2018-09-13 13:40:12 @cubeunited told you that you would regret your decision. As soon as you noticed your stocks were dropping dramatically you say “you haven’t come to a decision” yet. Sorry but it’s a little late to change your minds now. 
1847 2018-09-13 13:39:59 @stocktwits GOLD  signaled an important change. Kneejerks are always possible, BUT.... China stocks have been clobbered and may well be at a

1853 2018-09-13 13:37:19 And now, buy the @Apple #iPhoneX instead of the #iPhoneXS,  #iPhoneXsMax and the #iPhoneXR at much lesser prices. Only until stocks last. Secondhand and #Refurbished iPhones would actually be more #affordable now. XD #AppleEvent

1858 2018-09-13 13:36:32 Lmao @ cubes stocks dropping
1859 2018-09-13 13:36:23 Agreed! But finding "quality" stocks reminds me of Jack Bogle's wise words, it's akin to "looking for needles in a haystack", instead buy d market index haystack!
1860 2018-09-13 13:35:52 $TTD: Low floats play a major role in quick snapbacks from appreciable dips esp w/ stocks having this one's dynamics. Have witnessed it time & again over the years.

Cube: okay let’s not be hasty here we’re not done discussing maybe we can work something out.
#CubeIsOverParty
1863 2018-09-13 13:35:21 Come on people, trump is making all the stocks go up. Buy anything and win win win!
1864 2018-09-13 13:35:19 I see bottom stocks on 5 minutes chart are:
$NFLX
$GOOGL
1865 2018-09-13 13:35:15 Corn ending stocks are down alot from last year at this time but the price is virtually the same, when will dropping ending stocks bring higher prices?  Or will the USDA project more corn acres next year to squash any rally attempt?
1866 2018-09-13 13:35:14 Apparently yes. They didn't have any clue. but then the management changed their statement later, maybe because the news caused C*be's stocks to decreased by alot.
1867 2018-09-13 13:35:14 This is hard to believe.  They even describe what they are saying as "advice." This feels like dot com bubble investing all over again.  The analysis is here is that stocks going up keep on going up.  If they go down at some point that is a buying opportunity!
1868 2018-09-13 13:34:34 Stocks start with a rally. Dow jumps 135 points. Nasdaq gains 0.7%. Kroger tumbles 10% on disappointing sales. US oil prices retreat 1%, slip back below $70 a barrel. @CNNMoney

1872 2018-09-13 13:33:39 @awealthofcs Mr. Carlson: Question regarding stop loss orders. I am 90% invested in stocks & 10% in cash. The S&P 500 is near 26,000. Would you consider a stop loss order at this time? If yes, then what would be the limit - 10% drop, 15%? Thanks.
1873 2018-09-13 13:33:16 Even if Cube changes their minds, they’re still over. They saw their stocks plummet and went back on their decision. They don’t give a shit about their idols. It’s all for the money.
#cubeisoverparty
1874 2018-09-13 13:32:55 So use a pistol. Use a shotgun. The AR-15 cannot (and should not) be an option any longer — and more importantly, harsh jail time should be submitted for bump stocks too.
1875 2018-09-13 13:32:54 also cubes stocks are down 6.6% lmao eat shit
1876 2018-09-13 13:32:22 Dollar weakness: The US dollar Index drops to support at 94, sending gold, stocks and oil higher. Now, will the dollar bounce from this support, or is the trap door to 93 opening?
1877 2018-09-13 13:31:57 If I listened to everyone saying that the Stock Market was about to crash, I would have lost the opportunity to make serious money in Stocks.

Fearmongers are everywhere, stop listening to them, they are scared and want to project their fears on you!

#stockmarket #investing
1878 2018-09-13 13:31:55 There is no evidence that any human designed 'merit' based strategy for selecting stocks will perform better in the future relative to a random/diverse strategy.

A stock is the numerical representation of anything with known historical values & unknown future values.

1881 2018-09-13 13:31:30 Cube's cancelled, the drop in stocks is gonna affect other groups under them as well, which they don't deserve. It's all your fault, Cube.
1882 2018-09-13 13:31:22 Ya I guess they gotta take into account how badly their stocks are crashing  but seriously fuck them
1883 2018-09-13 13:31:20 Yes. That too. But imagine 20-30 quality stocks held for 10 years can also do the same.
1884 2018-09-13 13:31:15 what did they think would happen when they announced it....that their stocks would rise?
1885 2018-09-13 13:31:14 Good morning, hope all your stocks go up today 
1886 2018-09-13 13:31:04 Stocks dropped... CUBE: The decision isn't final. LOL
1887 2018-09-13 13:30:39  Swipe right for some back in stocks! @ Container Records
1888 2018-09-13 13:30:37 As income, @Mringz means regular payouts on your investment. 
Think of it like buying property, and then renting it out to receive monthly 'rent.'
Dividends are the equity (stocks) version of 'rent'
Some companies pay you at regular intervals for being a share owner
1889 2018-09-13 13:30:23 cube felt scared when their stocks suddenly dropping, well wrong move btches
1890 2018-09-13 13:30:19 And when their stocks market drop so bad, they decided to do discussion since 'artists opinion matters' lol Cube is so confusing
1891 2018-09-13 13:30:02 cube trying to save their stocks,,,
1892 2018-09-13 13:29:46 Woke up to Cube saying SIKE in the wake of their stocks tanking. They’ve already shown their true colors though. Ridiculous. A company run by bratty children is what Cube is.
1893 2018-09-13 13:29:22 " discussions " meaning they got scared when their stocks dropped and backtracked
1894 2018-09-13 13:29:13 Truly. When they saw stocks were affected, they decided to do something
1895 2018-09-13 13:29:13 Only one life to live! Im buying more stocks!
1896 2018-09-13 13:29:07 I’m seriously done if Cube “actually” kicks Edawn and Hyuna out. Like, why even make a statement if you’re just gonna back out of it? They saw their stocks drop; they saw the actual repercussions if that was to be their final decision.
1897 2018-09-13 13:28:54 cube really tried to backtrack when they saw the amount of backlash they received & their stocks falling lmfao
1898 2018-09-13 13:28:54 They saw their stocks drop. No company likes to see that.

*stocks went down after their removal*

cube: okay, bring them back, we just wanted attention.
1903 2018-09-13 13:27:37 Cube: Hyuna and E'Dawn are kicked out of Cube due to lack of trust

Cube: Well we're actually just reevaluating their contracts

1907 2018-09-13 13:25:59 Talking about what markets will do the next day / week / month? If that's what they mean, it might be helpful to pull up some old articles on what a Trump victory would mean for stocks (most were dead wrong). Might also be helpful to explain why ST moves are basically irrelevant.
1908 2018-09-13 13:25:42 so today....

1. Hyuna and Edawn got kicked out from CUBE and now the company is not sure, they are still discussing about it bc the stocks dropped(?)
2. Goo Hara to be investigated for assaulting his boyfriend.

what else
1909 2018-09-13 13:25:35 Finisar, Ciena stocks fall on Morgan Stanley downgrades
1910 2018-09-13 13:24:59 HIGHKEY tho seeing cube backtrack like that after seeing their own stocks fall,,, I’d rather have all their idols leave and join another company at this point, cube clearly didn’t care about their artists AT ALL
1911 2018-09-13 13:24:41 they’re backtracking bc they saw how low their stocks dropped
1912 2018-09-13 13:24:24 After they freaked out about their stocks falling? Nah Cube doesn't deserve HyunA & E'Dawn. They better not return to that crappy company after they did them dirty.

1914 2018-09-13 13:24:05 Pro Tip: Use Pivot Points as an overlay on a 5-min chart when getting in a trade. Aim for long entries under R3 and shorts above S3. $STUDY #stocks
1915 2018-09-13 13:23:52 Thanks, yeah now I primarily just hold dividend stocks and sell short puts. Short puts make money when stocks do well, so that's the primary driver of profit, just like if you held shares. The management style is more for practice / consistency as opposed to optimizing profit.
1916 2018-09-13 13:23:51 You still need a market-model to do this though, otherwise you buy back into stocks too early. BUT if you use a market model when its just a correction you also stay out too long as well. Lowers your draw downs but its no free lunch.
1917 2018-09-13 13:23:41 cube saw the backlash and their stocks going down and was all “oh no we gotta say sike”
1918 2018-09-13 13:23:35 Cube: Hyuna and E'dawn are out of our company because we cant trust them

Also Cube: Oh shit our stocks are dropping brING THEM BACK

1920 2018-09-13 13:22:39 Ok, for income you need to look stocks that have a good dividend yields, that pay dividends constiently and have constiently grown there dividends on a yearly basis. Alternatively, you can look at ETF's that focus on delivering dividends payments on a quarterly basis.

1922 2018-09-13 13:22:14 The Turkish Central bank has raised interest rates from 17.75% to 24%, injecting confidence in what investors saw as a vulnerable Emerging Market. The lira has jumped as much as 5% and Turkish stocks are on the raise.
1923 2018-09-13 13:21:53 Who is surprise here that Georgia university would be ok with unarm black men dying at the hands of cops after all, hanging black ppl is a favorite past time there. I am glad Nike stocks and sale has gone up.
1924 2018-09-13 13:21:25 This is my fear:The economy is going to stall big time and stocks will fall after the blue wave. Part of that is Trump, part is uncertainty as to where policy will go. If we go into a big recession pre- 2020, there won’t be time for Dem policy to solve the problem, or a red wave.

1933 2018-09-13 13:18:45 They probably saw their stocks dropping rapidly and panicked.. lmao.

1945 2018-09-13 13:15:59 I know I was like... who’s bills are you paying? She’s been keeping y’all running for a decade. 

It was like, y’all are gonna regret that decision. When their stocks be dropping harder than the bass drop on Bonfire.
1946 2018-09-13 13:15:59 at least their stocks are dropping ig
1947 2018-09-13 13:15:55 Someone @ Cube's CEO: Our stocks dropped an amazing lot  after we kicked out those two.
The CEO: WHAT?! Call them and talk with them we need them back.

1953 2018-09-13 13:14:30 cube regrets it? good . you lost legends , now your stocks are going down . we need hyuna and e’dawn to be on their own and show that they don’t need anyone to depend on 
1954 2018-09-13 13:14:09 Hi Helen, thank you for getting in touch. That is lovely & we hope Gus is settling into his new home Unfortunately we're not able to sell directly from our new factory, but Okehampton pet supermarket & the local @MoleAvonTrading store stocks our dinners

1957 2018-09-13 13:13:35 watching same stocks as yesturday $PETQ $MTCH $MEDP $BZUN all look ready !
1958 2018-09-13 13:13:10 It's been down since the middle of the night. I kept thinking my wifi connection was up the creek! lol It wasn't till I've turned on my desktop this morning that I realised none of my Ihub windows were loading at all.  Keep an eye on $BIOAQ today, it might carry on upwards maybe?
1959 2018-09-13 13:12:10 lmaoo cubes stocks already hit rock bottom thats what u deserve #CubeIsCancelledParty
1960 2018-09-13 13:12:03 Still haven't found out who made the phone call to all that you wish employees in the building to stay home that day who shorted the stocks for the airline's who were the Israelis on the New Jersey rooftop celebrating after the planes hit video taping it high five in each other
1961 2018-09-13 13:11:59 I've had clients present with these seeing what I think. 

Distributors also propose them as a way to avoid probate (also care home fees but then not falling foul of CRAG as probate the reason).

Barge poles are often mention in response along with 'chat with a proper solicitor'.
1962 2018-09-13 13:11:52 cube really said sike about them kicking out hyuna and edwan when they realized their stocks where going the fuck down
1963 2018-09-13 13:11:42 I’m pretty sure you’ve already heard by now but Cube said they kicked Hyuna and Edawn out cause they “couldn’t trust them” but once their stocks started plummeting the ceo backtracked and said they had to discuss it. But Hyuna and Edawn found out about all this through the news.
1964 2018-09-13 13:11:42 lol when cube retracts their statement of firing hyuna and edawn because their stocks crashed
1965 2018-09-13 13:11:28 Funny how cube immediately went back on their kicking hyuna and e'dawn out of the company thing the second their stocks started falling when international fans rallied together against them. Love how that works. It's like they care about money more than their artists
1966 2018-09-13 13:11:23 not how when a scandal happens everyone collectively checks the company stocks I bet half of y'all don't know what stocks are
1967 2018-09-13 13:11:20 Can’t wait for for y’all to lose y’all shit with these cannabis stocks..
1968 2018-09-13 13:10:58 i never enjoyed a company's stocks going downfall not until it happened to cube

1976 2018-09-13 13:08:00 Cube said that they kicked Hyuna and Edawn out of the company b/c they “couldn’t trust them” but after their stocks started plummeting the ceo said they haven’t made a final decision and have to talk about it with the company and artist next week.
1977 2018-09-13 13:07:46 cube saw how their stocks fell and were like hm maybe we’re fucking fools
1978 2018-09-13 13:07:34 but h*una doesn’t make all the money at cube,,,, like yeah their stocks dropped but people are forgetting they have other bands that are H U G E in Korea
1979 2018-09-13 13:07:30 @cubeunited y’all dropped 2 artist because they wouldn’t lie for you now you’re trying to bring them back because your stocks have plummeted...what did you expect when you drop money makers?
1980 2018-09-13 13:07:14 Did they see their stocks drop or did they see all the tweets when Hyuna was trending 
1981 2018-09-13 13:06:30 Did Cube take that back because their stocks were dropping drastically???
1982 2018-09-13 13:06:08 IKR HAYS PAGKATAPOS NILANG IKICK OUT? LOOOL BAGSAKAN DAW NG STOCKS AFTER THAT EH HAHAHAHA

*stocks dropped drastically*
cube : uh-uh its not confirmed yet well do a meeting to discuss abt their withdrawal 

eleh tahu takut shes literally paying your bills
1993 2018-09-13 13:03:04 the only reason cube is “thinking on their decision” to kick out hyundawn is cause their stocks went down...

2000 2018-09-13 13:01:34 If Hyuna buys Cube their stocks will go back up.
2001 2018-09-13 13:01:34 THEY SAW THEIR STOCKS DROPPED VERY FUCKING LOW SO NOW THEYRE LIKE "uhhh it's not confirmed tho yet"
2002 2018-09-13 13:01:08 The press is now the enemy of the people -- this is a simple answer for me. 
Look at the lies they've perpetrated in the past few years. 
Look back longer and you'll see a trail of lies. 
They think they control how we think, but they don't. 

Media stocks plunge.
2003 2018-09-13 13:00:58 And after they saw their stocks going down they just denied their leaving

2015 2018-09-13 12:59:05 And then have say 5% in high risk investments and scale out reducing exposure. Cover anything from Biotech stocks & ETFs to mineral mining companies and REITs
2016 2018-09-13 12:59:02 Short the market and all your long ideas are stocks trending down. What a great strategy. Then pick on CNBC to deflect your awful trade ideas.

2033 2018-09-13 12:52:26 And without beast and 4minute disbanded? Who are they expecting to bring in more money? Their stocks dropped terribly. Even the knetz know Hyuna will do better with other agency.
2034 2018-09-13 12:51:31 thats exactly why I'm with the index. i did stocks and shares for a bit so have a bit of experience but if you dedicate time to learning the market you won't need much previous experience at all, just your football knowledge. biggest tip is to not panic when a player loses value

2038 2018-09-13 12:50:32 Sad how Cube Ent. is only backtracking because they are seeing their stocks literally fall by the second. Naaaah, you already made your statement and stabbed their mf'ing backs - you can't just say Ooopsie. Hyuna and E'Dawn deserve better.

2050 2018-09-13 12:47:06 these the same people that think buying penny stocks is the only way to invest as if the merch resale market hasn’t been boomin for years
2051 2018-09-13 12:46:33 Yeah!!! and the fact that cube backtracked the second the stocks started going down shows that the only thing they, and most other companies, care about is money and profits
2052 2018-09-13 12:46:07 Cube is so full of shit. They saw stocks tank and suddenly yesterday's news wasn't official even though it was literally an official statement from cube. If hyuna decides to say they better be groveling at my girl feet bc she deserves WAY better
2053 2018-09-13 12:46:01 anyway cube's cancelled and I'm laughing at their stocks plummetting to the ground
2054 2018-09-13 12:45:31 Because their stocks took a huge hit  Hyuna keeps their lights on
2055 2018-09-13 12:44:59 Vieron que los stocks cayeron en picado y están intentando pararlo pero si yo fuera ellos los mandaría a la mierda INMEDIATAMENTE
2056 2018-09-13 12:44:58 About 12 hours ago.  But cube took it back cause their stocks dropped 5% which is huge. They’re shit.
2057 2018-09-13 12:44:35 Treat the people you associate with like stocks and bonds. Anyone that add to your value treat them as an asset. Anyone that take away from your value treat them as a liability. Know the difference...

2080 2018-09-13 12:37:19 Emotions are a huge part of investing.  Which emotion is worse? 1. Selling for a small loss?  2. Not selling & suffering a bigger loss? #stocks
2081 2018-09-13 12:37:14 lmao after this their stocks dropped
2082 2018-09-13 12:37:08 Cubes stocks are dropping so now they said they're discussing. They're backpedaling cause they're losing money.
2083 2018-09-13 12:36:50 So cubes stocks dropped so low they brought hyuna and her bf back?? Dhdjdhdjd
2084 2018-09-13 12:36:31 they saw their stocks drop and realised they were booboo the fools
2085 2018-09-13 12:35:45 I know it's so sad, but I'm very sure that their stocks are really gonna drop yeah
2086 2018-09-13 12:35:44 cube said "oh fuck . our STOCKS!"
2087 2018-09-13 12:35:43 It's so fucking clear cubes ceo is a greedy bastard cuz he was so ready to get rid of them and then the stocks went down and he's like oh shit
2088 2018-09-13 12:35:39 So Cube saw their stocks going down after  their official statement about them being removed of the agency and now suddenly it’s not a final decision yet this is really interesting  still cancelled for being this trashy 
2089 2018-09-13 12:35:20 Cube after watching their stocks crash: who said we were gonna kick them out? We love Hyuna and (reads hand) Edwin (:

They are retracting their earlier statement because "it hasn't been finalized with the top executives." While all I see are stocks dropping and reason to retract.
2092 2018-09-13 12:33:31 Ang taas pa rin ng demand ng Elujai, next week sige paliguan ko kayo ng Elujai, reserve your stocks now!
2093 2018-09-13 12:33:26 Oohhh Cube saying that Edawn and Hyuna leaving Cube is still being discussed? Bet you didn't expect your stocks to drop *that* low, did you?
2094 2018-09-13 12:33:20 I own no stocks or bonds outside of my retirement accounts.  Wish I had the disposable income to invest, but life gets in the way sometimes.
2095 2018-09-13 12:33:19 ALL trip 0 stocks have notes which is a bad trap. Now that we have Rod with a 16 million a year revenue company this is our chance to pay off those notes and buy back those shares to reduce the O/S!
2096 2018-09-13 12:32:50 I’m pretty confident the Russell 3000 value consistently through time has had a large weighting to financials. Which is the biggest problem with it. 

Other problem is a matter of concentration. They likely invest beyond the # of stocks that would make it in line with research
2097 2018-09-13 12:32:42 Now y'all wanna act like shit didn't already go down when you see your stocks dropping @cubeunited

2100 2018-09-13 12:32:25 See,after their stocks (or whatevah u call those) went down,they immediately released a statement that Hyuna and E.Dawn getting kicked out of Cube isn't final. Lol.
2101 2018-09-13 12:32:21 lmfaooo cube be panicking bc their stocks are going down so quickly after releasing the news of hyuna and edawn dismissal from the company and are trying to fix their own mess
2102 2018-09-13 12:32:12 Lsldldl it's so funny that after cube saw their stocks they said that the final decision hasn't been made yet

2109 2018-09-13 12:28:26 their stocks DROPPED as soon as they announced the news and honestly their scramble to try and make themselves not look like fucking morons is... so humbling 
2110 2018-09-13 12:28:09 cube: pinalayas na namin yung lovebirds kasi may trust issues kami

2119 2018-09-13 12:25:36 we all know that they realized their stocks were dramatically dropping so they try to save face
2120 2018-09-13 12:24:54 This is some next level shit right here... I’m so disappointed, never expected that from a US company. No wonder Google is not getting anything right anymore. Google stocks for sale, I’m definitely not trusting this people with my money..

2122 2018-09-13 12:24:14 At that point, after what they have done to the couple, I really hope the 2 don't stay at Cube anymore despite the company trying to save their money (after the stocks went down). Who still trust CUBE?
2123 2018-09-13 12:23:55 CUBE be like: "We can't take them anymore, this is too much. We've wasted our time and lost SO much money" 
*Release official statement*.....*Stocks drops* 

"Uh.... Our statement is not final, we shall give our final decision soon.." 

Internally: "FUCK!!!!"
2124 2018-09-13 12:22:54 Apparently now cube is like "haha but we are just talking about it" even after having an official announcement and most people believe because after the new blow up cube stocks went down

I'm still  over the whole thing
2125 2018-09-13 12:22:43 If it takes low stocks for CUBE to retract their statement then maybe I really don't want HYUNA and E'Dawn there
2126 2018-09-13 12:21:52 after seeing yall stocks dropped and yall decided to say its not cfm yet goshhh a mess what a joke
2127 2018-09-13 12:21:02 hahaha.. biglang bawi nung bumagsak stocks nila... hahahahaha....
2128 2018-09-13 12:20:48 “Business decision” well that’s one hell of a decision because their stocks are crashing. Cube just shot themselves in the foot
2129 2018-09-13 12:20:13 Look who is talking about being smart LOL
2130 2018-09-13 12:20:05 Actually, I don’t think HyunA and E’Dawn should go back to Cubeshit. It won’t be a good call as the agency is clearly taking advantage of them after seeing their stocks drop massively. Cubeshit doesn’t deserve these two talented artists.

2140 2018-09-13 12:16:46 The ceo just back tracked "no final decision has been made to kick them out yet" yeah you saw your stocks fall badly after it was announced.. Cube you screwed up.
2141 2018-09-13 12:16:14 avoid trading and investing in our stocks and markets from monday.. Not a good time.. Be safe with  your hard earned money
2142 2018-09-13 12:15:55 Few hours ago, CUBE released a statement about HyunA and EDawn being kicked out of their agency. Hmmmkay! 2 hours later, their stocks dropped in an unimaginable way for just 2 hours time. And now, they released a statement saying that nothing is finalized and official. Wtf! 
2143 2018-09-13 12:15:53 i know cube is mad but do they think their mad-ness benefits them bcs i can hear the stocks drop so hard
2144 2018-09-13 12:15:12 lmao, cube realised just how big hyuna is with their plummeting stocks, now they're trying to backtrack. good. hyuna made cube.

2147 2018-09-13 12:14:58 they’re probably only doing all this bc they saw their stocks go down  since they HAD released a official statement
2148 2018-09-13 12:14:56 Oh Sarah your just jealous. WTP love all the work he is doing. Bringing jobs, lower taxes, $ in my pocket and stocks, border security making other countries pay their fair share. We are not the piggy bank any longer. TY @POTUS

2161 2018-09-13 12:10:07 cube is literally making things worse like their stocks stink after scandal.. then its gonna drop again cause they kicked out hyuna. fucking HYUNA.

2170 2018-09-13 12:08:17 Like you kick two ppl out your company cause you wanted revenge or to "teach them lesson" since they went against your statement AND DIDNT TELL THEM just to end up with your stocks dropping.
2171 2018-09-13 12:08:01 Waiting for the day these weed stocks die so momentum can enter in small cap land again.
2172 2018-09-13 12:07:59 LMFOAF cube really saw their stocks plummet and were like “okay now wait a minute”
2173 2018-09-13 12:06:45 them stocks have them spooked
2174 2018-09-13 12:06:12 yo so i calculated how much CUBE lost in stocks and they lost almost 5 million dollars since it was announced
2175 2018-09-13 12:05:31 LMAOO cube must’ve seen how low their stocks dropped and decided to change their minds on hyuna and e’dawn, they’re that pressed for money it’s so sad
2176 2018-09-13 12:05:30 Amida is a werewolf who trades stocks as a hobby.
2177 2018-09-13 12:05:17 Apparently now they're "having discussions" with the two of them, since their stocks started dropping.
2178 2018-09-13 12:05:15 I just want to understand what CUBE thought would happen after their statement?
Did they think their stocks will rise and everyone will be like "OMG YES THEY'RE OUT" are you fucking kidding me CUBE??

2180 2018-09-13 12:04:35 Cube regretting kicking their only asset after stocks go down. Ungrateful company. She has been giving her all for 11 years. Queen HyunA and Edawn dont worry, you will remain succesful no matter what #현아 #CubeIsOverParty

2183 2018-09-13 12:03:02 does cube have stocks bc rip cubes stocks
2184 2018-09-13 12:02:59 quando o hyunseung saiu dos beast e os beast saíram da cube as stocks também desceram a pique,, mas a cube tinha a hyuna para os salvar.. agora não têm ninguém
2185 2018-09-13 12:02:17 cube: *kicks out edawn and hyuna from company*
stocks: *plummets down*
cube: w-wAIT
2186 2018-09-13 12:01:26 Cube's stocks has been stable the past few hours because they decide to postpone the news lmao

2188 2018-09-13 12:00:57 Because you saw the stocks drop? Hmmm.. 
2189 2018-09-13 12:00:29 They know full well they kicked the can down the rd, bailed their stocks out, saved Waal St, shifted the burden to sovereign debt (tax payers pensioners) and lit a time bomb under the bond market (government ability to borrow).
2190 2018-09-13 12:00:19 Lmaoooo Cube took one peek at their stocks and was like "shIT WE GOING DOWN SHISTERS MEETING MEETING" I hope Cube chokes lol
2191 2018-09-13 11:58:47 Stocks at its highest point ever
2192 2018-09-13 11:58:26 this however has sent e cash barons into panic mode resulting in e rapid lose of value is going tru as individuals speculate and sale of stocks with old mutual to get rid of e bond bt e parallel market increases e rate to take advantage of ordinary #Twimbos
2193 2018-09-13 11:58:12 Marcus Stocks loves me the most
2194 2018-09-13 11:57:58 did cube just seriously announce they were gonna kick out hyuna and e’dawn only to say it’s undecided as soon as they saw that they’re stocks were lowering bc they noticed she is the one that pays the bills in that messed up place?? lmao i have to laugh
2195 2018-09-13 11:57:36 I think it makes me more mad they the company took back their statement just because stocks dropped. They know they would be nothing without hyuna + they need Edawn. At this point they should leave and end CUBE
2196 2018-09-13 11:57:34 sm stocks: rises up
cube stocks: drops down :(
2197 2018-09-13 11:57:32 I'd put them in stocks in the City Square. Charge the tourists to throw cricket balls at them.
2198 2018-09-13 11:57:30 Apparently Cube stocks dropped significantly today as well! So either it’s an interesting PR stunt, or they didn’t realise just how much this decision would affect them...

2202 2018-09-13 11:56:26 Can’t really say anything at this point. Hype is once again raising weed stocks high. Don’t chase the once that have run up. Not saying they won’t continue to run but risk of bag holding of runners of junior stocks is greater.
2203 2018-09-13 11:56:20 Nike’s stocks are way up and Woodward has sold record-breaking numbers of books. Thanks, @realDonaldTrump! These may be your greatest economic success stories!
2204 2018-09-13 11:56:10 I just hope that HyunA and Edawn leave cube. A entertainment that doesn't support their Idols and only care about stocks and money don't deserve these two, I hope they leave and create their own company or sth.

2208 2018-09-13 11:55:12 maybe cube was so scared because of how their stocks went conpletely down and said HOLD TF UP WHO'S GOING TO PAY OUR BILLS
2209 2018-09-13 11:55:05 Ikr, also their stocks have gone like 6.5% down since then
2210 2018-09-13 11:54:59 Cube’s stocks went all the way down rose a bit and still going down  help idk what to feel coz Btob still there tho and Seonho....
2211 2018-09-13 11:54:56 cube feels the urge to let go both hyuna and edawn probably : 
1. they have g(i)dle cube “new rising star” 
2. backlash from fans are affecting pentagon 
3. cube stocks (?)

2221 2018-09-13 11:53:27 i bet they saw their stocks crashing down and scrambled to say its not true 
2222 2018-09-13 11:53:03 So Cube aren’t kicking out Hyuna and E’dawn? I guess they saw that it was their loss after their stocks plummeted and they’d have to produce from YG’s basement #CubeIsCancelledParty
2223 2018-09-13 11:52:51 cute saw their stocks going airplane emoji down and decided to think through their decision?

2227 2018-09-13 11:52:16 if cube's stocks dont plummet to HELL imma be a mad bitch. if these assholes wanna be fuckin petty, i want to show them what petty really means
2228 2018-09-13 11:51:57 Nike gambled with their future, it paid off massively. Stocks closing all time high and sales being up by 31
2229 2018-09-13 11:51:31 Faites gaffe que Danilson Da Cruz ne vide pas les stocks avant que les supporters arrivent
2230 2018-09-13 11:51:20 I knew I’d read somewhere that bluefin stocks in the northern hemisphere had increased massively- especially on the eastern American seaboard.
2231 2018-09-13 11:51:13 They didn't remove her and edawn. 
They wanted to but their stocks dropped harder than my Grades so they were like "GUYS WE ALL SFOOLED YOU, ISSA JOKE"
2232 2018-09-13 11:49:22 or if there are still no stocks :(( me want a SNSD - Party album 
2233 2018-09-13 11:48:50 cube: hyuna nd hyojong r getting kicked out!
cube, after seeing their stocks going down: SIKE
2234 2018-09-13 11:48:34 Tapos binawi ng Cube nung bumagsak stocks nila 
2235 2018-09-13 11:47:26 The saving is in real estate and in the life-tenure pension, so he’s better off than my millionaire butt. I much prefer it when judges don’t own stocks: I lost a cert petition once because a Justice was recused by law because of a minimal investment in an opponent.
2236 2018-09-13 11:46:48 Hmm i guess we can get cheaper price for iphone x klu they want to clear the stocks hehe
2237 2018-09-13 11:46:46 CUBE let go of HyunA and E’Dawn through statement and without discussion like they did with their relationship only for it to backfire and have their stocks drop, so now they’re like sike. This shit is wild.
2238 2018-09-13 11:46:03 they probably won’t, but the fact that they first decided that they will kick them out then as soon as the stocks started falling they’re like “omg no we’re not kicking them out anymore !!1!1!1” is awful. they shouldn’t be allowed to treat idols like this
2239 2018-09-13 11:44:40 So yall telling me that Cube saw the stocks and the hate for their vvvvv poor decision and went. “Lmao nah just fucking with yall” LMAO ALRIGHT
2240 2018-09-13 11:44:31 ur right i didnt think of it that way ... ive been seeing some ppl thinking that cube has a higher value for their stocks n i was like ......... they dont
2241 2018-09-13 11:44:27 They take it back. Nagbaba kasi stocks nila
2242 2018-09-13 11:44:18 cube, watching stocks plummet after kicking out hyuna & edawn: shit
2243 2018-09-13 11:43:59 Who is the marginal buyer of stocks atm? At the same time there are plenty of ppl with decent returns at this stahe

2247 2018-09-13 11:43:35 Ikr! But the company's stocks DROPPED after the news, hyuna is the money maker so they'll be stupid to let her go
2248 2018-09-13 11:43:28 their stocks fell so much since the announcement and the backslash from fans was so big, I'm not surprised
2249 2018-09-13 11:43:10 Start talking about stocks...

These guys are cashed up! 
2250 2018-09-13 11:42:40 ha i can imagine cube being conflicted between kicking hyuna&edawn out but losing stocks or keeping them but losing their faces 
2251 2018-09-13 11:42:20 Now Cube Entertainment's stocks are going down when the fans learnt that the Couple is gonna leave

Now they're not sure about kicking The both 

HAHAHAHAHAH KARMA STRUCKED YOU HARD 
2252 2018-09-13 11:42:17 LMAO one of my architect friends had texted me 2 hours ago asking should I buy BIST stocks from here. Poor chap missed a monster rally on not even day one but day minus zero.
2253 2018-09-13 11:42:01 but stocks fluctuate w/ companies every time rumors go around. They shouldn’t be surprised by this. Communication what??

stocks: [drop] 
cube: IRONICALLY
2257 2018-09-13 11:39:57 Well apparently CUBE retracted and said that they haven't confirmed their decision of kicking out Hyuna and Edawn... After their stocks plunged down 
2258 2018-09-13 11:39:52 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
2259 2018-09-13 11:39:42 CUBE truly said SIKE after the stocks dropped lmaoo
2260 2018-09-13 11:39:41 lrt, lmao watch them changing their minds after their stocks fell like a bitch
2261 2018-09-13 11:39:35 changed their stance on hyuna & hyojong cus they realized how bad the backlash was n how quickly stocks were dropping or because they realized how indispensable those two are as artists
2262 2018-09-13 11:39:00 they’re so unprofessional.. at least their stocks are going down
2263 2018-09-13 11:38:50 i read somewhere saying that cube is currently denying the whole kicking out thing and is “still figuring things out” because their stocks dropped pretty badly but im not sure tho :(( but then again,,, cube is still pretty messed up
2264 2018-09-13 11:37:49 #CubeIsOverParty imagine your stocks dropping because you wouldnt let two people date in peace?

We've been with Namaste since 12 cents and created just a few millionaires from it.

This is the nature of the smallcap world.  Glad you weren't a part of it.
2270 2018-09-13 11:34:04 Coz the stocks immediately drops lol
2271 2018-09-13 11:33:48 Cube: E'dawn and HyunA are no long in our company
*fans are outraged, their stocks drop and Jessi's about to beat them up*
Cube: LOL JK NOTHING'S CONFIRMED OUR ARTISTS OPINION MATTERS TO US

2280 2018-09-13 11:31:08 Cube ent: We're kicking out  hyuna and edawn and that's final.
*Cube's stocks go horribly down*
Cube ent: ermmmm, remember what i said about the decision being final? Euuuuh yeah, maybe not.
2281 2018-09-13 11:31:01 Sell everything and put it all in pot and liquor store stocks

Cube:Oh shit,no,come back
2285 2018-09-13 11:28:24 aft they announce they're dropping Hyuna and Edawn, Cube's stocks dropped.. So they're trying to salvage 
2286 2018-09-13 11:28:22 Lol because their stocks have dropped
2287 2018-09-13 11:28:15 they saw their stocks falling and they were like oh shit we need them
2288 2018-09-13 11:28:07 Latest Tool album.....um wait
2289 2018-09-13 11:27:46 Sure Cube, ditch the face of your entertainment and 1/10 of Pentagon just because of tRuSt iSSuEs and dAtINg sCaNDalS and bringing them back after your stocks drop. Sounds great. 
2290 2018-09-13 11:27:18 Top decile of S&P 500 by weighting includes poorly performing stocks notes Gregg Guerin of First Trust Global Portfolios; this poses a problem as many active managers plump for them, hence continue to underperform the index he argues
2291 2018-09-13 11:26:39 Funny how cube saw their stocks drop and have finally come to a realisation how important hyuna is.
2292 2018-09-13 11:26:21 WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING

** Asia markets higher overnight, while European markets mixed
2293 2018-09-13 11:25:33 Good thinking mate - if the Stocks are still good it makes sense to ride it out. As long as you hold a sensible number the natural diversity will help overall. I find occasional Index Shorts help the psychological side.
2294 2018-09-13 11:25:21 stocks* kasi anuva
2295 2018-09-13 11:25:10 us at cube stocks: THIS BITCH EMPTY..... YEET
2296 2018-09-13 11:25:00 im sad i love you so much hyuna that dumb bitch cube deserve that drop of stocks
2297 2018-09-13 11:24:57 $TLRY $AMD examples of stocks you don’t short because it’s gone up so much so fast. If you do try to short these, have a tight stop. Don’t underestimate the power of momentum and the squeeze.
2298 2018-09-13 11:24:53 Stop joking about CUBE’s stocks dropping, people have mouths to feed and families to support.
2299 2018-09-13 11:24:37 LMAO IKR- but apparently they’re “talking about it” which is what they said when they realized their stocks were going YEET
2300 2018-09-13 11:24:21 Dow at 8000 when Obama took office, to call it "his" boom 2 years into Trump's presidency is ignorant. If the Dow had tanked, would it have been O's fault? Media/Dems predicted the whole country would fall apart in the first year. Your stocks are still making gains, no? Hypocrite
2301 2018-09-13 11:24:14 They saw their stocks tank and they panicked like hell jfdhhsah
2302 2018-09-13 11:24:04 SKIN BEAUTIKA SET FULL STOCKS
2303 2018-09-13 11:24:01 funny how quick cube was to take hyuna and edawn back when they saw their stocks plummet
2304 2018-09-13 11:24:00 they saw their stocks plummet
2305 2018-09-13 11:23:57 Cube: "We don't trust u guys anymore"
: *kicks out HyunA and E'Dawn
Cube's stocks: *going down
Cube: "wait nvm"
2306 2018-09-13 11:23:57 it’s awful. it feels like cube doesn’t care about them at all at this point, they just care about the money the artists bring in, hence suddenly saying they’re not being kicked out just because their stocks have dropped ://
2307 2018-09-13 11:23:48 what a joke honestly. pathetic. the stocks literally went down by 8% before decreasing to a 6.57% loss as of now
2308 2018-09-13 11:23:33 Stocks dropped and Cube got scare? This is the most BS ever? What yall gotta have a board meeting about??? Please.
2309 2018-09-13 11:23:15 The truth is that you weren't able to sale the 128GB version and it was available for sale till 1 pm yesterday.
You just want to clear your stocks.
Dont fool us.
2310 2018-09-13 11:22:51 lmaooo cube what a joke releasing a statement and then trying to redact it to save ur hides and plummeting stocks over a decision that was so blatantly irrational and petty
2311 2018-09-13 11:22:41 KSE-100 up 527 points to 41049; KSE-100 Index gained 527.87 points to close at 41049.91, 222 stocks closed up 99 closed down while 22 stocks remained unchanged. Volume Maple Leaf Cement Limited closed at Rs 51.06 down 0.12 paisa.
2312 2018-09-13 11:22:39 they knew they fucked up when their stocks started going downhill and now they hesitating
2313 2018-09-13 11:22:26 Cube really saying their decision to kick hyuna and hyojong out is not final. Smh bet they saw their stocks dropping and are scared to go bankrupt
2314 2018-09-13 11:22:20 Damn after losing a lot of stocks hahahahahahah
2315 2018-09-13 11:22:19 uma bagunça, eu twittei sobre tudo, quase uma compilation se você quiser ver...
mas resumidamente: cube anunciou que hyuna e edawn foram kickados da empresa
agora pouco cube anunciou que se arrependeram da decisão (os stocks deles caíram MUITO rsrsrs) e que estão discutindo
2316 2018-09-13 11:22:12 Stocks are the wave omm
2317 2018-09-13 11:22:11 It was confirmed.....they just saw that their stocks were falling and decided to probably take em back
2318 2018-09-13 11:22:08 And will will use the stocks . You can’t pick and choose  refute
2319 2018-09-13 11:22:03 China stocks gonna fly like it's already chinese new year fireworks 
2320 2018-09-13 11:21:55 Grandmommy left each kid 14 thousand when she died. I used 4 thousand on stupid shit and put the rest in stocks like she would've liked. I pulled 8 or 9 thousand out recently to pay for my surgery. Thank you, Grandmommy.
2321 2018-09-13 11:21:47 and so celebrating their stocks plummeting is not also celebrating the harm to other groups?
2322 2018-09-13 11:21:31 @thinkorswim I add and subtract stocks from my watch lists then later they have disappeared and the olds ones are back on there.
2323 2018-09-13 11:21:17 cube saw their stocks going down so they changed their mind on hyuna and hyojong this is so sad
2324 2018-09-13 11:21:14 im really appalled that cube really kicked hyuna out like watch their stocks plummet
2325 2018-09-13 11:20:57 She’s rather fond of the stocks, too.

2326 2018-09-13 11:20:47 Liquidity will move to chinese stocks out of indian stocks especially if crude continues its rise up
2327 2018-09-13 11:20:43 now cube is only reconsidering cos they r losing stocks
2328 2018-09-13 11:19:45 Do not let noise distract you from the fact that CBs are there to support stocks for the foreseeable future unless a black swan derails their plans. I suspect refunds to passive investors as part of next bailout. The ultimate QE will come. @jedimarkus77

2330 2018-09-13 11:18:58 I think HyunA and edawn would be better off on their own without s company that doesn't support them and only takes them back because their stocks dropped hard <_<
2331 2018-09-13 11:18:50 Cube checked their stocks and were like WAIT WAIT WAIT
2332 2018-09-13 11:18:49 Ok but Cube saying they kicked out Hyuna and Edawn THEN backing off that statement because the stocks dropped omg imagine the mood in the building... The animosity JUMPED OUT
2333 2018-09-13 11:18:33 Guys...do the stocks dropping effect the payment of the artists in the company...

2339 2018-09-13 11:16:12 Tobacco stocks rally in e cig fight! Are they behind this effort to bully e cigs? Lot more toxins in their cigs and they are losing huge market share because of this. No fiberglass or ammonia in the vapes makes u wonder why tobacco co”s would put these bad chemicals in their cigs
2340 2018-09-13 11:16:08 they suddenly became hesitant on removing them since their stocks dropped akskksks

Cube  : Hey stop u all, we will go bankrupt

2343 2018-09-13 11:15:08 Stocks are just about managing expectations and they over promised and under delivered , hence stock owners are selling .

2360 2018-09-13 11:09:25 hope you enjoy your declining stocks from losing two of your most talented artists, uglies. you're gonna need it for all this PR and extra work you're for sure gonna make your other artists do to try and call attention away from it smh @cubeunited
2361 2018-09-13 11:09:06 Yeah. Not bad. Basically virtual stocks over owning footballers. Paid Fantasy/FUT sort of?
2362 2018-09-13 11:08:51 they kicked them out without their knowledge but when their stocks dropped they said they will discuss lol cube is over
2363 2018-09-13 11:08:46 Well they can enjoy their stocks crashing and burning and everyone despising them
2364 2018-09-13 11:08:42 Tingin ko talaga may nangsasabotage ng career ni Hyuna sa loob ng Cube Ent, or not only for Hyuna but to Cube itself. First half of the year, pataas yung stocks ng Cube, paglabas ng iba't - ibang issues nagkadeleche na yung company.
2365 2018-09-13 11:06:37 save their stocks
2366 2018-09-13 11:06:37 you did this to please those pathetic pieces of shit??? was it worth it??? was it worth it, now that you've lost some of your greatest performers who've stayed loyal to the company all this time??? now that your stocks are going down the fucking toilet??? fuck you
2367 2018-09-13 11:05:37 won* erros na cotação, reflexo dos stocks da cube caindo a cada minuto

2370 2018-09-13 11:04:38 Damn their stocks fell to the ground after saying that hyuna and edawn are not in give anymore.
2371 2018-09-13 11:04:37 How pow'rless ye For evil or for worse-- But, ere you leave me and set me in the stocks for a scurril rogue, and so we parted.
2372 2018-09-13 11:03:54 mukhang babawiin kasi bumaba na kaagad yung stocks. 
2373 2018-09-13 11:03:32 Lmao last time I got annoyed by the stocks going down because of the datin scandal and all. I felt bad for cube.
But now I am laughing because their stocks are going down. They deserve it.

2374 2018-09-13 11:03:22 Wow, you Trump Supporters sure do know how to throw a boycott....

Nike stocks rose to their highest in the history of the company.

So much for your boycott! 
2375 2018-09-13 11:03:21 good morning. i love and miss kun but besides that, cube ent. are full of assholes who think that if they listen to every toxic “fan” that they’ll get their stocks up again smh
2376 2018-09-13 11:03:20 their company stocks dropped to rock bottom now they want to save their asses yikes no turning back
2377 2018-09-13 11:03:15 cube: hyuna and e dawn are out
cube: *sees their stocks drop
cube: I said hyuna and e dawn are out having dinner wtf is the commotion about
2378 2018-09-13 11:03:06 Fed says it whipped US unemployment, but at a potential cost  - unemployment at all time high, stocks up, business coming back and that were stolen from overseas all because of THIS Pres. Trump. Addressed real issues that politicians too lazy to address.
2379 2018-09-13 11:02:40 OPO HAHA 6H AGO AY OFFICIALLY KICKED OUT NA SILA TAS NUNG NAGPULL NG STOCKS ANG HOLDERS AY BINAWI NILA HAHAHAHA "PINAG IISIPAN" PA LANG DAW TALAGA MGA GAGO HAHAHAHAHA
2380 2018-09-13 11:02:14 lrt cube's just saying that cuz their stocks dropped even worse
2381 2018-09-13 11:02:05 how funny is it to see your stocks get down fast
2382 2018-09-13 11:01:58 Wtf i dont understand cube's actions.. they saw stocks fallinf down, so they announced 'still in talks'? Honestly, Hyuna and E'Dawn should say no to this sh*t. But probably there is more than this dating scandal, which is common in kpop.
2383 2018-09-13 11:01:48 Global Stocks Rise, because the Investors ignore all Sign they can. And because they feel Artificial safe. MENTALLY ILL
2384 2018-09-13 11:01:24 Girl my work stocks a bunch of vegan, cruelty free brands but I have no idea if they're any good (and my broke ass is too poor to try them) can you please check out inika, elate, ere perez, lily lolo, and eye of horus??????
2385 2018-09-13 11:00:44 kita ko nga yung pic na biglang baba ng stocks nila hahahhahahaha "pinag-iisipan" daw hahahahhaha
2386 2018-09-13 11:00:27 first you fcking kick them out without them knowing then after your market stocks drop you say it was not confirmed
2387 2018-09-13 11:00:05 Capitalism tells us we must slave away in order to make our worth.  But then, people do slave away, put in their 40 hours, and still they cannot eat without food stamps.

Then capitalism turns around and let's the rich do simple things, like trade stocks, and accumulate vast....
2388 2018-09-13 11:00:00 There are AGMs tomorrow for AJG & SVST. #Stocks #Markets
2389 2018-09-13 10:59:23 cube: *kicks out edawn and hyuna* *stocks drop* 

also cube: shit i take it back
2390 2018-09-13 10:59:14 No, I'm a trader - right now I am trying to learn as much as I can about as many markets as I can and then make the choice of whether or not to specialize in one.  I learned a bunch about forex, already knew a bunch about stocks, now adding options to my toolbox.
2391 2018-09-13 10:59:11 what are cube fcking trying to prove here ? kicked them out and then stated they haven't left yet ? maybe cause they got scared their stocks went down so... HA !
2392 2018-09-13 10:58:52 ayan na at nagsisimula na pong mag droo ang stocks nila
2393 2018-09-13 10:58:48 Right, DW must own stocks in @WarnerBrosEnt and be the majority shareholder to be allowed to do what he wants, as he wants  whenever he wants
#BoycottLethalWeapon
2394 2018-09-13 10:58:44 Look at CUBE being booboo the fools trying to state they're negotiating with Hyuna & E'Dawn after seeing their stocks plummet rapidly 
2395 2018-09-13 10:58:12 He is the miracle man flicks his finger stocks go up flicks again joblessness goes down flick again industries comes back to just a genius
2396 2018-09-13 10:58:12 うぇうぇうぇ
2397 2018-09-13 10:57:57 "decision is not definite" so they mean to say they accidentally put out an official statement that said that after much discussion they removed hyuna and edawn because the trust is gone but seems like after the stocks went down the trust is back
2398 2018-09-13 10:57:43 Can u post stocks for sweaters
2399 2018-09-13 10:57:30 after their stocks dropped, they changed their mind... If I was Hyuna, I'd leave this shit company
2400 2018-09-13 10:57:04 Absolutely. I was tracking C*ube's stocks today and couldn't help but wonder what I've always wondered with our fandom as well - that the ones with the loudest tweets, delusional fantasies, are not actually the ones with buying power or decision-making influence 
2401 2018-09-13 10:56:57 Scientific research on one of the planets most studied fish concludes that the BFT stocks in the  N Atlantic are on the rebound & well on he way to recovery and fished sustainably.
2402 2018-09-13 10:56:55 Cube ent. Won't kick out HyunA and E'Dawn tiwala lang bababa stocks nila pag kinicked out sila
2403 2018-09-13 10:56:54 Hyuna and e dawn did NOT deserve this treatment and the disrespect. But the fact that cube's stocks are dropping also affects the other artists (Pentagon, btob, (g) idle, etc) that did nothing wrong and don't deserve this
2404 2018-09-13 10:56:21 takot sila kasi biglang bumaba stocks nila eh :////
2405 2018-09-13 10:56:15 Not everyone shares this sentiment.  The sprint car elitists typically feel this way. But when I go to a dirt track, I look forward to seeing multiple classes. Sometimes the action in the street stocks is better than the 410s.
2406 2018-09-13 10:56:13 Reviewing some commodity stocks charts and listening to that dim bulb Andrea Horvath complain about Ford.  4 more years NDP/lefto/commie pinko/socialist scum. Hee Hee.

2408 2018-09-13 10:55:54 They forget how their stocks drop when beast (highlight) leave them. Now if hyuna leaves, it will hard to recover

2412 2018-09-13 10:54:18 their stocks are going down now and now they regret
2413 2018-09-13 10:52:56 they deserve the drop in their stocks. 
2414 2018-09-13 10:52:53 This is bullshit. Cube's stocks will drop eventually
2415 2018-09-13 10:52:35 dropping artists 'cause you can't manipulate them any longer... watch your stocks bubble bubble drop drop
2416 2018-09-13 10:51:39 cube ceo @ hyuna & e'dawn: no dating allowed. u guys r kicked out

*a few hours later*

cube staff: sir, our stocks are falling as we speak after we kick them out

cube ceo after seeing hyuna & edawn with their baggages going out of cube building: wAIT HOLD THE FUCK UP
2417 2018-09-13 10:51:34 Bumaba tuloy stocks ng cube 
2418 2018-09-13 10:51:23 It's so funny because Cube somehow only realized they fired their biggest sources of income after their stocks dropped drastically due to the news of them being fired
2419 2018-09-13 10:51:21 cube saw it's stocks go down and did a whole 360 bitch bye
2420 2018-09-13 10:51:08 @TradingEddie206 dude do you consider volume on these stocks? they seem to be quite low.
2421 2018-09-13 10:51:03 we had a really different time last year. the smart guys went to stocks without looking back. there are only two types of people here still:  1. the Fomo ones who want to "drive lambo asap" and 2. the people who are here to learn, improve skills and get market inside.
2422 2018-09-13 10:50:51 I would buy tobacco stocks because they will be in the marijuana business, but only if they drop their tobacco products.
2423 2018-09-13 10:50:43 (Cube after stocks dropping): this was an experiment--
2424 2018-09-13 10:50:39 So hyojong and hyuna found out through articles they were kicked out. Then I guess Cube realized how fucked up their stance was most likely bc their stocks plummeted they backed out on their statement. Like if that isn’t a slap in the face to everyone and mostly hyojong and hyuna
2425 2018-09-13 10:50:35 so i just want to say to cube that don’t expect ur stocks to get better after u kicked out both of ur legendary artists
2426 2018-09-13 10:50:09 so apparently cube is holding “urgent meetings” abt hyuna and edawn instead of kicking them out,, bet they went back on their decision after seeing how fast their stocks dropped 
2427 2018-09-13 10:49:54 Carter I’m struggling. How do yo trade MJ stocks, Canadian and US stocks in general? What platform can you use as a small trader based in the UK. Everything seems focused towards the bigger investor

2430 2018-09-13 10:48:42 After their stocks dropped, naging in discussion. Isang malaking wtf diba.
Hyuna might as well leave. The fact that they're considering kicking her out is beyond me. 

However, I'm really worried for EDawn. Wala siyang masyadong background sa career niya to be stable enough.
2431 2018-09-13 10:47:59 after bumaba ang stocks ng cube, some articles say that di pa confirmed and under discussion pa???? PLASTIC NIYO CUBE (!!!!) HARU JUSQ
2432 2018-09-13 10:47:35 Hedge Fund Says Chinese Stocks Could Fall Further This Year
2433 2018-09-13 10:47:24 cube fucking realized that their stocks are going down if they kick out hyuna and hyojong
2434 2018-09-13 10:46:57 and i thought cube was a decent company “oh no stocks are dropping”  and “let’s kick hyuna and e’dawn out!” isn’t gonna end well jUsT sAyin
2435 2018-09-13 10:46:28 Across Spain, Ireland, France more are being landed through bycatch, this can't be helped. Maybe instead of being dismissive it is time to open the floor to constructive debate? Ridiculous comment to say 'stocks' aren't increasing when evidence suggests it is going that way.
2436 2018-09-13 10:45:45 They must have felt their stocks going down
2437 2018-09-13 10:45:43 Too late for that. Their stocks & market value will decline anyway. Such a shitty company that shows how insincere they are in managing their artists as human beings
2438 2018-09-13 10:45:19 Can anyone plz lend me 1 crore INR. Will give my stocks worth after starting my company 
Jokes apart, its a killer! But Jag need fresh models to rival bulls n horses. The new Aston Martin DB11 is sleek n hot. Hope to see its rival from Jaguar; the brand new I mean! 
2439 2018-09-13 10:45:14 I hope so too especially after they saw their stocks crush maybe they will realize that they made a big mistake.
2440 2018-09-13 10:45:12 It’s like cube conflicted between fans and public, they kick their artist out to please crazy fans then return them the next minute cause they’re afraid for their stocks 
make up your damn mind
2441 2018-09-13 10:44:57 la verdad que me alegra ver como cube cae en picado con los stocks esos como se digan que me sigue sabiendo mal por los que se quedan pero
2442 2018-09-13 10:44:50 i@hope idle and pentagon aren’t affected by cubes stocks plummeting but cube is still dumb
2443 2018-09-13 10:44:21 I'm just here laughing as Cube's stocks drop 
#cubeiscancelledparty #CubeIsCancelled
2444 2018-09-13 10:44:00 cube : hyuna and edawn are not dating

Cube’s Stocks: drop 

Cube: wait

2450 2018-09-13 10:42:52 They're  thugs should be put In  stocks and have cabbages thrown at them
2451 2018-09-13 10:42:45 Probably saw the stocks
2452 2018-09-13 10:42:21 i hope y’all ruin cubes profits nd stocks or whatever omg i hate those bitches they deserve what’s coming
2453 2018-09-13 10:42:09 they just keep changing their statement cause they realized their stocks are going on a skyfall
2454 2018-09-13 10:42:07 cube : edawn and hyuna kicked out
edawn and hyuna : saying goodbye to their cube friends and about to leave the building when
cube : sees stocks falling down
cube : edawn! hyuna! come back! sorry for kicking you out! you know we didnt mean to kick you out

2459 2018-09-13 10:40:28 There's not excuses for this, believe me they will lose way more money for kicking them out, their stocks are tanking, they are so stupid for doing this, they are just dating, they didn't kill, steal, or did something really scandalous so no excuses for this.
2460 2018-09-13 10:40:08 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
2461 2018-09-13 10:39:53 6+128 is most popular? lol no. It's completely the opposite & this just a marketing gimmick to sell out the slow moving stocks 
2462 2018-09-13 10:39:52 now that their stocks dropped a lot they are apparently DISCUSSING kicking them out cube really did play themselves
2463 2018-09-13 10:39:31 cube seeing their stocks: wait a minute.....yall know what........
2464 2018-09-13 10:39:25 even my cousin whatsapp me about the cube ent stocks crashing situation
2465 2018-09-13 10:39:24 @stocks_420
2466 2018-09-13 10:38:59 That was probably it 
CUBE: *kicks Hyuna and E'Dawn out*
Their stocks: *FUCKING DROP*
CUBE: FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK WE SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT, LET'S SAY WE'LL DECIDE IT NEXT WEEK
2467 2018-09-13 10:38:46 cube stocks dropped after announcing the removal of hyun a and edawn so they rlly said HOLD TF UP ITS NOT CONFIRMED 
2468 2018-09-13 10:38:41 Lmaooo you're telling me Cube is postponing the removal of Hyuna and Edawn after seeing the stocks drop???

2470 2018-09-13 10:37:53 Their stocks dropped
2471 2018-09-13 10:37:17 That's what the quotas were implemented for though - to protect stocks.
2472 2018-09-13 10:36:23 bumaba daw kase stocks ng cube nung nabalitaang aalsin na silang dalwa sa cube kaya nagdalwang isip.
2473 2018-09-13 10:35:58 No they just care about their stocks, not the idols.
2474 2018-09-13 10:35:49 Cube stocks for the next 10 years we going  down
2475 2018-09-13 10:35:42 Maybe they saw how much their stocks dropped and just were like “fuck lmao abort mission”
2476 2018-09-13 10:35:36 cube is just pathetic af they r kicking they arists out n then after seeing their stocks are in a ditch they apparently want to have a discussion w them lmao
2477 2018-09-13 10:35:14 Billions of tax dollars buying back stocks for shareholder's instead of trickleing down to employees.  Sad!

but sub say sakon main HR walay hoty.
2479 2018-09-13 10:34:53 even if cube decides to not kick them out, the fact that they did try until their stocks went down is still disgusting like they obviously don’t care about their artists and hyuna and hyojong should be hellla recompensated for what cube did to them #CubeIsCancelledParty
2480 2018-09-13 10:34:23 After they see their stocks tumbling close to 10% in a day.. Of course they would be saying that
2481 2018-09-13 10:34:18 Marijuana stocks still doing well, their stock's warrants are doing even better. Take care in the markets.

2487 2018-09-13 10:32:39 True. Your holding period for stocks is probably longer timeframe. In such circumstances I don't think I would be comfortable holding either. Using momentum + 'new catalyst/story' can be a profitable trading strategy, in the right mkt - alternate to using momentum/fundies theme
2488 2018-09-13 10:32:16 Make him sit out the 3 years, his stocks will go down and he'll be worthless after the 3 years. Greedy prick wants more cos he's a rep player.
2489 2018-09-13 10:31:50 cube: lowkey kicks out edawn and hyuna 

(cube stocks drop)

cube: lmao guys chill it's not like we've confirmed it or anything
2490 2018-09-13 10:31:29 $IQ..If trying to pick a bottom in the Asian stocks, buy the ones that have held support. MOMO,IQ,BILI. Maybe BIDU.
2491 2018-09-13 10:31:20 Lmao now that their stocks went down suddenly they’ve changed their stance
2492 2018-09-13 10:31:20 $IQ..If trying to pick a bottom in the Asian stocks, buy the ones that have held support. MOMO,IQ,BILI. Maybe BIDU.
2493 2018-09-13 10:30:26 cube stocks are down 200.00 now. they really thought they were doing something LMFAO get cancelled.
2494 2018-09-13 10:29:37 so cube really just changed their minds about kicking out hyuna and edawn after their stocks dropped by 6.5% lmfaoo they're full of shit 
2495 2018-09-13 10:28:58 more like tanggal na talaga kaso tumalon sa bangin ung stocks kaya biglang “uy teka joke lang”
2496 2018-09-13 10:27:49 They did but then they changed their decision maybe after seeing the drastic decrease in their stocks
2497 2018-09-13 10:27:41 Hyuna and E'dawn: We're dating.

Cube: I'll kick you out.

*Stocks dropped*

Cube: I'm just joking, bitches.
2498 2018-09-13 10:27:34 Experience of what, exactly? Selling our gold stocks at a derisory price?? "Ending boom and bust"?? (Hollow laughter). Believing his own hype, maybe.
2499 2018-09-13 10:27:31 We all know that it's only because of their loss in stocks
2500 2018-09-13 10:27:24 Oh their stocks immediately took a drop the moment it was announced. Apparently they are still in discussion so they arent kicked out yet. With how this is handled, hell, i want hyuna to go. She doesn't deserve this. Hyojong and PTG are gonna be hurt regardless and that's :'(
2501 2018-09-13 10:27:24 seeing them stocks falling, cube be playing another drama haha
2502 2018-09-13 10:26:42 Investment advice: if it looks like they’ll leaglaize weed, invest in potato chip and ice cream stocks immediately!
2503 2018-09-13 10:26:06 cube saw their stocks drop and said sike
2504 2018-09-13 10:25:55 Hi There. We will continue to sell the iPhone X while stocks last. If you would like more information on this device, please give our team a call on 150 for more help. -Suzie
2505 2018-09-13 10:25:38 so in discussion ang cube ngayon,,, sana mag-pabebe sila hyuna sana di sila agad pumayag sa mga gusto ng cube matapos sila ikick out ng walang pasabi tapos ibabalik dahil bumaba stocks nila??? ano sila joke??
2506 2018-09-13 10:24:38 What? NO! I hope that you see this issue as more than getting those "stocks" up. And fyi, all cube artists are working hard right now.
2507 2018-09-13 10:24:30 They changed their mind after their stocks dropped  now they're going to have a meeting
2508 2018-09-13 10:24:19 Yeah you're right - I like to sleep like a log though so would rather deploy my Cash into solid Businesses that are already proven. Trouble with Hype Stocks is when the Bubble pops - most Holders will watch it fall back massively. And of course will be illiquid when pops.
2509 2018-09-13 10:24:10 the fact that cube redacted their statement about kicking hyojong and hyuna out after they starting losing hundreds of stocks the generation we live in
2510 2018-09-13 10:23:42 they only care about stocks, this is what happens when you drop the backbones of your company
2511 2018-09-13 10:23:34 Stocks generally change slowly, even when the flows into or out of them change suddenly. Therefore, stocks act as delays or buffers or shocks absorbers in systems.

2513 2018-09-13 10:22:43 Well probably when this bull market ends , it will be the start for a mega bull run on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies #bitcoin #crypto #stocks
2514 2018-09-13 10:22:16 cube deserves their stocks going down but the ones paying the price will be their artists and they don't deserve that
2515 2018-09-13 10:22:11 But there was an update that all this uproar (Cube Ent stocks dropped 10% in 6 hours) is causing them to rethink the situation and the final decision on kicking them is being made next week with board of directors.
2516 2018-09-13 10:21:44 bobo cube e nangkikick ng mga artists nila na nAgbubuhat sa stocks nila
2517 2018-09-13 10:21:30 Well of course lmao Watched the stocks drop and ran back to the meeting room re-discussing this shit. They really are the biggest joke of 2018
2518 2018-09-13 10:20:51 they've switched the story like three times since that article now they're having a meeting next week to figure out if they rly wanna do it or not after their stocks went down
2519 2018-09-13 10:20:36 The numbers of bluefin tuna coming to UK waters has increased. That does not necessarily mean that 'stocks' of bluefin tuna are increasing.
2520 2018-09-13 10:20:12 lmao @cubeunited backtracking so hard when they saw the stocks plummeting  "nO NO IT'S NOT CONFIRMED GUYS, we're not ~kicking them out~ ahaha"
2521 2018-09-13 10:20:08 Y'ALL CAN'T JUST SAY, "OH CRAP, OUR STOCKS ARE DROPPING AND THE FANS ARE HELLA MAD...........LEMME JUST TAKE THEM BACK IN..........AS IF I JUST DIDN'T KICK THEM OUT" LMAOOO WHAT THE HECK CUBE, GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER, YOU'RE CANCELLED EITHER WAY #CubeIsCancelledParty
2522 2018-09-13 10:19:42 The numbers of bluefin tuna coming to UK waters has increased. That does not necessarily mean that 'stocks' of bluefin tuna are increasing.
2523 2018-09-13 10:19:03 Epekto na sa stocks og bonds HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
2524 2018-09-13 10:18:43 Big time people don't buy petty stocks. Why? Because they are too smart
2525 2018-09-13 10:18:41 I do not fancy cryptocurrency trading. I don’t see bitcoin as something you can trade and profit from it similar to stocks.
2526 2018-09-13 10:18:36 Tyler wants   from   stocks ?!? >:( 
2527 2018-09-13 10:17:32 It 620am and I woke up to cubes headassery. It's too fucking early but have fun with your shit ass stocks my dudes
2528 2018-09-13 10:17:27 They are so cute while I'm watching fancans I'mma be thinking of was to lower cubes stocks even more WE STAN BANGTAN  #BTSinOakland
2529 2018-09-13 10:17:12 also, cube’s stocks went downhill after the 1st announcement. maybe that’s what changed their minds, idk 
2530 2018-09-13 10:16:31 And if it were true, it would mean those stocks are over-valued on fundamentals, and the money would be rightly reallocated into other stocks and investments.
2531 2018-09-13 10:16:27 Faudrait vraiment que supreme revoient leurs stocks Parceque là c’est plus possible
2532 2018-09-13 10:16:11 Stocks: 

Cube Ent: oh sorry that was my friend he stole my phone lol haha
2533 2018-09-13 10:15:59 Thanks for the reply and best of luck with the show
2534 2018-09-13 10:15:47 they should have at least waited a few weeks and say they actually were in a relationship together...
Stocks went down after their announcement and a lot of sponsors backed out.
Because they made the label look bad...
2535 2018-09-13 10:15:18 My wife doesn’t know a thing about stocks but every time the market goes down she says “why don’t you just buy, it always goes back up again?”  Thing of it is, for almost a decade she’s been right...
2536 2018-09-13 10:15:13 The stocks of bluefin in local waters in Cornwall and Devon is growing year on year, a small slice of the eu quota would certainly help local fishermen diversify into something new.
2537 2018-09-13 10:14:44 Gawa ata ng stocks. Napaghalataan tuloy. Juskoooo 
2538 2018-09-13 10:14:43 do ppl realise cube’s stock going down =/= they’re losing money or going bankrupt.. like the stock info is there more as a perception of the company, showing how much shares are worth for investors and doesn’t mean they’re losing money if stocks drop or gaining money if they rise
2539 2018-09-13 10:14:39 Ok so cube is debatting this issue bc they saw their stocks dropping and ew. I kinda want Hyuna to leave and Hyojong too just to say fuck u to cube... but you're right pentagon does need him. I think Hyuna would be fine. But this rlly is destroyed their relationship
2540 2018-09-13 10:14:36 Cube: hyojong and Hyuna? We don’t know them sis.

Everyone else: ok have fun with that

*stocks drop*

Cube: actually we DO know them and they can stay under-

2543 2018-09-13 10:14:00 apple stocks rise by 30%.
2544 2018-09-13 10:13:41 how ironic would it be if cube  changed their minds after seeing the stocks and hyudawn left like ah sorry we cant trust you :I
2545 2018-09-13 10:13:30 Wow now I want Hyuna and E’dawn to officially not stay with cube so their stocks reaaaally drop
2546 2018-09-13 10:12:44 Why don't you support him. I would really like to know what is not good about him.  I support him because he's bringing America back to where it was before u liberals screwed everything up.America first. Jobs, Boarder, economy ,milktary ,Stocks, salarys up constitution . On and o
2547 2018-09-13 10:12:41 I know! If there were a miniature rows of stocks containing little Rees-Mogg, Gove, Johnson and others, I would be a very happy bunny.
2548 2018-09-13 10:11:58 How they haven't signed him yet is beyond me.

The fact that Nike stocks went up 31% after the controversial ad shows that any game with Kaepernick would be a sellout. 

Plus, he can play.
2549 2018-09-13 10:11:39 Honestly I kind of hope the two of them tell Cube where to go after trying to change their minds on something they had clearly already made up their minds on until they saw their stocks drop (at one point as much as 10%)
2550 2018-09-13 10:11:18 I envy you! :-). At the same time, I actually am (partly) to blame and (must) feel guilty for buying the *full stocks* (that typically meant no more than 5-6 units) of available '08 and '09 Negru de Purcari bottles whenever/ wherever I found them selling at RO wine retailers...
2551 2018-09-13 10:10:55 This guy is amazing smoked a puf and made the Tesla stocks loose billions. I surely admire his guts
2552 2018-09-13 10:08:24 how cube is now backpedalling and unsure ab their stance on hyuna and hyojong as if they didn’t realise their stocks would plummet if u removed 2 very talented and well loved artistes ..
2553 2018-09-13 10:08:14 they cant let their stocks get on a downfall knowing how influential both artists are COWARDSSSSSSSSSS
2554 2018-09-13 10:07:55 cube saw their stocks drop at that insane rate and said sike
2555 2018-09-13 10:07:43 watch out for cube ent's stocks going down
2556 2018-09-13 10:07:32 Hey Abdul, we are working to bring enough stocks, stay tuned to our next sale on 18th September 2018, 12 PM only on Flipkart. Also, we don't encourage black marketing, we request you to kindly buy only from our Authorised Seller, Flipkart Thanks
2557 2018-09-13 10:07:25 so basically cube saw their stocks going down so hahahaha
2558 2018-09-13 10:06:57 cube: yo u out hyuna and edawn
*stocks crashes*
cube: actually, wait
2559 2018-09-13 10:06:55 Their stocks aren't worth much to begin with. They leveled out saying that they will further discuss the matter to keep it from dropping more, but they risk more market faith being lost after a final decision. I don't think any direction will save their reputation though...
2560 2018-09-13 10:06:41 CUBE STOCKS BE DROPPING FASTER THEN MY GRADES,IM LIVING THE LIFE YALL
2561 2018-09-13 10:06:36 Good job cube for kicking out them!! Bcs they will have a better life than u do and they won't have a shitty company n prob have thier own / better company. your stocks r gg .
2562 2018-09-13 10:06:04 Stocks Bili na 
2563 2018-09-13 10:06:02 See babagsak talaga stocks nila
2564 2018-09-13 10:05:48 cube released a statement saying its not a final decision for edawn and hyuna being kicked out of the company but im betting my life it was final until they saw their stocks dramatically dropped the minute they released the news lmfao
2565 2018-09-13 10:05:35 cube’s stocks are going down 

they going broke
2566 2018-09-13 10:05:32 they kicked them out, hyuna and edawn found out about this through the internet bc apparently they never discussed it with them, cube saw their stocks drop dramatically and said theyre reconsidering their decision. its a whole ass mess
2567 2018-09-13 10:05:31 By stocks, so he did
2568 2018-09-13 10:05:28 I've just posted a new blog: China welcomes US offer of talks as tariffs loom on $200 billion of goods

2569 2018-09-13 10:05:28 No, it isn’t. Stocks peak when confidence is at record. So these 2 thoughts go hand in hand.
2570 2018-09-13 10:05:18 ok cube make up your damn mind,,, or like maybe they saw their stocks goin down and were like “nah yall can stay lmao”
2571 2018-09-13 10:05:00 One look at their stocks and they’re begging for them to come back.

2573 2018-09-13 10:04:05 stocks
2574 2018-09-13 10:03:58 cube really fucked up that bad like uhhh how can they fuck up like THAT   obviously the stocks will hit rock bottom. they really let go of their biggest talent for being HONEST lmaoooooooooo
2575 2018-09-13 10:03:54 Also all the people laughing at the stocks dropping are trash and it shows they don’t actually care about any of the other members or other artists that are still under cube
2576 2018-09-13 10:03:31 The worst thing about being a stock picker is that your mind is inevitably associating all stuff with stocks.  When even in a toilet you weigh between CERA and HSIL and  you associate toilet papers with paper pulp shortage and its impact on paper price you  need therapy. 
2577 2018-09-13 10:03:11 the stocks dropping tho whooooo
2578 2018-09-13 10:03:04 im losing it a little bit theyre like look at that our stocks dropped..... we werent expecting that

2583 2018-09-13 10:01:18 I think it's so sad to see Cube kicking Hyuna and Edawn out over them being in love and then to backtrack only because of their stocks... please  it's so pathetic

2590 2018-09-13 10:00:05 Cube was getting pretty brave until stocks plummeted.
2591 2018-09-13 09:59:30 CUBE: We're so tired of juggling their schedules. We should just let them go, let them face the hate, that'll teach them. 

*kicks them out, stocks plunge, other companies probs alr offering HyunA & E'Dawn contracts* 

CUBE: WAIT it's not confirmed yet they're still with us haha

Slide into real quick before stocks last
2593 2018-09-13 09:58:51 Is the show likely to tour @ScottJKyle1 ?
2594 2018-09-13 09:58:42 Did they seriously not tell hyuna and e'dawn that they were kicking them out of the company, then saw their stocks going down and were like 'actually they arent being kicked out we're just discussing it'
Lmao enjoy bankruptcy cube
2595 2018-09-13 09:58:38 Starting to invest my money into stocks  then invest it into real estate to 
2596 2018-09-13 09:58:29 cube saw that almost 10% drop in stocks then started to panic ya'll should've just done nothing
2597 2018-09-13 09:58:24 cube trying to save their stocks now huh................
2598 2018-09-13 09:56:43 @cubeunited wow really so you kick both of them about but then you take them back in because if the stocks, what is this it seems that all you care is about the money. Let them date they are also humans and if there "fans" don't support them, they weren't really fans at all

2600 2018-09-13 09:55:51 cube is only changing their minds because their stocks are dropping like flies
2601 2018-09-13 09:55:17 Y'all know that Cube stocks is going down because of the news that HYUNA would be kicked out. Not because of Edawn too. Hyuna's impact did that. Korea doesnt even know who Edawn is.
2602 2018-09-13 09:54:28 Apparently, even before Cube kicked edawn and hyuna today their stocks were already dropping ever since all the dating news surfaced.
2603 2018-09-13 09:54:25 Wow blue squarr was scared when they saw the stocks going down after the announcement. And wqs like panicking on how to fix the mess they made.
2604 2018-09-13 09:54:04 From the articles, they never discussed with cube about revealkng their relationship so it's like they're taking revenge which is totally unprofessional and now cos their stocks go down they change their stance  we all have no idea what they're doing
2605 2018-09-13 09:53:56 Their stocks went down tho, so idk what attention they were expecting to get 
2606 2018-09-13 09:53:48 How are you going to fire them then see your stocks crashing and rehire them I hope both of them leave anyway
2607 2018-09-13 09:53:31 As soon as they announced it them stocks dropped. They have to renigg their statement.
2608 2018-09-13 09:53:30 I legit think cube thought that everyone was going to be happy and relieved after kicking them out but that loud minority real silent now as your stocks plummet  #CubeIsOverParty
2609 2018-09-13 09:53:14 Lmao they panicked when they saw the stocks, I hope Hyuna and Edawn leaves cube for real and that pentagon follows

2611 2018-09-13 09:51:56 Oh now your postponing the expulsion just because stocks went down so drastically. Hahahahahhaha @/cube u a bitch
2612 2018-09-13 09:51:55 People are trading real stocks instead of pumped sh*t. Open your eyes and start focusing on higher priced stocks. This is a great market with a ton of opportunities and high volatility, if you know what to look for.
2613 2018-09-13 09:51:10 Apparently, even before Cube kicked edawn and hyuna today their stocks were already dropping ever since all the dating news surfaced.
2614 2018-09-13 09:51:03 cube ent will be brother broke ‘cause the sister stocks are daughter dropping because of their dad dumbassery. cube ent is a father fool
2615 2018-09-13 09:50:52 wow now cube be like "oh shit our stocks are dropping let's think about it again" :/
2616 2018-09-13 09:50:31 So Cube wants to kick Hyuna and EDawn out just because they’re dating, wow. And now they’re holding an “emergency meeting” about this because their stocks came down so bad when this news came out. Hyuna and EDawn do not deserve this disrespect. @cubeunited ya’ll are disgusting.
2617 2018-09-13 09:49:47 Lmao cube took back their statement saying that Edawn and HyunA are kicked out & they're still going to discuss it? Y'all make me laugh, you just saw your stocks dropped and now you took back what you said
2618 2018-09-13 09:49:16 Cube now saying Hyuna and Edawn did not leave the company. Fjsjs must be because their stocks DROPPED
2619 2018-09-13 09:49:00 Would you look at that. Hyuna and E’dawn are still at cube. Cube Ent. saw the stocks going down probably We’ll see what happens from here on out. They better not force them to break up
2620 2018-09-13 09:48:22 I hope their stocks drop more tbh, so that these k-fans won’t be delusional thinking dat they own their idols life

stocks: drops
cube: what the fuck who said that,,,, we thought april fools came early this year
2624 2018-09-13 09:47:23 lets all look at cube stocks falling idk u are losing the best artists in cube i wish both of them can find another company that can accept them ooffff dont give up hyuna and edawn
2625 2018-09-13 09:46:47 Ah oo! Pero lalo bumagsak stocks nung tinanggal nila si hyuna and edawn
2626 2018-09-13 09:46:42 If cube is trying to stop their stocks from dropping by now saying nothing is confirmed yet, do they not realise that thats going to make their stocks drop even more?
2627 2018-09-13 09:46:31 LOLOLOL giliran stocks nya drop langsung batalin.
2628 2018-09-13 09:45:58 did their stocks go down before or after they were ‘kicked’ from cube. and did they only say it wasn’t decided bc there was backlash
2629 2018-09-13 09:45:31 cube was already a horrible agency to begin with, do they actually think they'll be able to function without hyuna & edawn? esp hyuna, she's like the golden child of the agency. of course they had no choice but to change their mind after seeing their stocks decreased
2630 2018-09-13 09:45:24 all it took was a lil dip in ugly box’s stocks for them to be like UHHH SIKE
2631 2018-09-13 09:45:03 They literally saw their stocks dropping like a brick then went "WAIT NO WE DIDN'T JUST FIRE TWO OF OUR MOST ICONIC IDOLS SIKE"
2632 2018-09-13 09:44:56 lol stocks tanked by 150%, now theyre like "iTS iN DiScUsSiOnS"
2633 2018-09-13 09:44:52 Now, after their stocks dropped, they're saying they're "still in discussion."

But the fact they're even having a discussion about whether or not they're kicking out HYUNA is already ridiculous.
2634 2018-09-13 09:44:07 All available information of #stocks arereflected in it's #prices, and
 price is a fair reflection
of #fundamental #analysis. A #Priceless  strategy that always works is following the #price.
2635 2018-09-13 09:44:06 Oddly I often wake up with stocks on my mind and RMS was one of the those this morning. So I sent the guys at vox a message to update the name etc they're doing it now but will be doing some more research on it (and yes I dream stocks )
2636 2018-09-13 09:44:05 Yeah they say that because they saw their stocks . They don’t deserve this shit just because they fell in love! They’re better than cube entertainment.
2637 2018-09-13 09:43:52 LMFAOO CUBE IS TAKING BACK THEIR DECISION AFTER SEEING THEIR STOCKS DROPPING FAST
2638 2018-09-13 09:43:48 信長の忍び見なきゃ...
2639 2018-09-13 09:43:41 LMAO THEY SAW THEIR STOCKS DROPPING AND SAID SIKE
2640 2018-09-13 09:43:20 The thing is Hyuna and E'Dawn are talented artists, they will be able to sign to other labels (I hope). Cube let go of two amazing Artist. No wonder their stocks are dropping. They stooped low with this one
2641 2018-09-13 09:42:24 Yup yan din sabi sa article hahahaha also cmon, Hyuna's one of their top profit-makers so talagang babagsak sila kung ngayon pa lang their stocks crashed down na
2642 2018-09-13 09:42:12 7% drop in Cube stocks so far, I can only see that increasing.
2643 2018-09-13 09:41:52 All those people celebrating Hyuna and Edawn removed from Cube are literally petty kids that has too many fantasies
Celebrating so what? They can't even do anything to bring up Cube's stocks... All they did was destroy Cube and all other artists there
2644 2018-09-13 09:41:34 US – US Equity futures and European stocks were steady while Asian shares ended the longest losing streak in 16 years as US Treasury Secretary reached out to Beijing to offer another round of trade talks.
2645 2018-09-13 09:41:04 That was the first statement. After their stocks plummeted and media reported they didn’t even tell Hyuna and Hyojong about it they took it all back and said the decisions isnt finalised and that they are talking to them both along with other artists!
2646 2018-09-13 09:40:47 i hope hyuna and edawn will stay successful and happy TOGETHER while cube’s ungrateful disgusting and unfair ass keep seeing their stocks plummet until it reaches a point of no return. They can DIE idc
2647 2018-09-13 09:40:39 Good time to evaluate AMC stocks. The AUM grows with index/interest rates,fees on growing AUM increases,new inflows due to financialisation of savings, high operating leverage,decreasing cost/income,will do better when corporate tax goes down. Study HDFC,Reliance #multibagger
2648 2018-09-13 09:40:25 I think........ What we can learn from this..... ....... ..... is that cube are big ol pussytings that freaked out the moment they saw their stocks plummeting and pulled a SIKE
2649 2018-09-13 09:39:18 biglang bawi ang cube kase bumababa ang stocks nila hahhaha
2650 2018-09-13 09:39:14 CUBE: Hyuna and E'Dawn are out!

CUBE: iT'S jUsT a PrAnK bRo!

2654 2018-09-13 09:38:40 YOU CANT JUST TAKE BACK WHAT YOU SAID BC YOU NOW REALISED THAT YOUR STOCKS WENT DOWN AFTER YOU KICKED THEM OUT
2655 2018-09-13 09:38:39 cube realised real quick how big of a mistake they made when their stocks went down drastically , its barely been hours and they already NEED hyuna. we love karma.
2656 2018-09-13 09:38:34 Yep and 2.3 trillion of gold in the basement... gone. Die hard real life.
2657 2018-09-13 09:38:22 Cube, you're kidding me right? When your stocks going down now you're saying it's just a discussion? Disgusting
2658 2018-09-13 09:38:10 lmao cube changed their “STANCE” about HyunA and E’Dawn leaving. DUDE YOUR STOCKS DROPPED AND NOW YOU WANT THEM BACK. LMAO.
2659 2018-09-13 09:38:00 #LME stocks: #aluminium -1,775 T, #copper -7,900 T, #zinc -5,975 T, #lead -875 T, #nickel -1,848 T and #tin unch

2665 2018-09-13 09:36:10 Cube is having a suicidal. Self destruction. Lantawon ta sino mangabudlay kamang stocks da.
2666 2018-09-13 09:35:48 Hopefully post #Brexit we can continue research with @CefasGovUK @UniofExeter on the increasing blue fin stocks in  waters and discuss a sensible bycatch and recreational strategy for the species.
2667 2018-09-13 09:35:45 I really wanna buy some stocks/shares but ....
2668 2018-09-13 09:35:41 Cube is so pathetic I'm literally laughing 

"Hyuna and E'Dawn got kicked out"

*sees how their stocks drop*

"It's not a final decision yet!"

"It's final, they got kicked out"

"The decision will be made next week" 

What the hell is this mess 
2669 2018-09-13 09:35:09 How is removing Hyuna and E'dawn from the label gonna help them raise their stocks? Cube is out of their sane minds..
2670 2018-09-13 09:35:08 I should buy some stocks huh?
2671 2018-09-13 09:34:49 cube def saw their stocks immediately go down after the announcement lmao
2672 2018-09-13 09:34:47 avec leurs stocks qui sont en train de couler là ils vont aller nulle part...
2673 2018-09-13 09:34:27 The rule you mention unworkable....find and deport anyone jobless after 3 months?...get real .....we can devise rules to preserve fish stocks quite well,ourselves.

2675 2018-09-13 09:33:50 Splendid Detox stocks arrived naaa!
2676 2018-09-13 09:33:31 CUBE only realised how important Hyuna was after their stocks started to plummet from announcing the news of her being kicked out (w/ E’dawn). They want her back to make money  She’s better off making her own company where SHE makes the rules.
2677 2018-09-13 09:33:11 Great call again Sandro!! You have been accurate on a lot of stocks!! Keep going.
2678 2018-09-13 09:33:05 100k preorder in Ktown4u .. 50k in Interpark.. 150k just from two sites.. i hope we have enough stocks for the stores 
2679 2018-09-13 09:32:54 Natakot sila bumaba stocks eh hahahahaha
2680 2018-09-13 09:32:45 this just proves how cube is easily swayed by delulu fans and has NO LOYALTY for they don't stand by their artists, now they're backpedaling because their stocks dipped the fuck
2681 2018-09-13 09:32:34 Yes, it sounds reasonable, of course. I'm still curious if it really works this time. The Apple stocks were not very impressed after the keynote.
2682 2018-09-13 09:32:34 Then why did the FDA's announcement today skyrocket tobacco stocks?

Because vaping is a huge threat to the tobacco industry, and this kind regulatory action is only good news for tobacco sales.
2683 2018-09-13 09:32:12 hyunadawn: kicked
cube stocks: plummeting
cube: bet
2684 2018-09-13 09:32:08 The stocks are going up for Russ after that Purp encounter 
2685 2018-09-13 09:31:42 True,but if you had bought those stocks at their peak and had a strong hand and held them...10× increase on some of them.
2686 2018-09-13 09:31:28 Dating dimps unya something about sa ilang sales and stocks na niubos tungod lang nagdate sila
2687 2018-09-13 09:31:21 Hyuna literally carried cube on her back and this is how that ungrateful company repays her.. I just want to say good luck to cube for throwing their cash-cows out the door cause their stocks are dropping faster than my grades. 
2688 2018-09-13 09:31:17 anuna Cube Entertainment, KARJAK KAYO AH ANO BAGSAK STOCKS NIYO AHHAHA
2689 2018-09-13 09:31:01 Lmao they probably changed their stance seeing their stocks plummeting
2690 2018-09-13 09:30:47 The issue with scallops in thr BdS highlights the future needs for ratified mngt decisions for shared stocks based on sound bioeconomic & wider ecosystem science. Sound mngt plans are 1 thing, level of CS alloc are another, but can be part of a maintainable mngt plan.
2691 2018-09-13 09:30:36 yeah fuck them. they change their narrative the minute their stocks drop.
2692 2018-09-13 09:30:32 Order now while stocks last
2693 2018-09-13 09:30:29 so in short, natakot cube ent nung nag announce na tinanggal na si hyuna kaya binalik nila. Laki ng binaba sa stocks e hahahaha boooooooooooom ano kayo ngayon
2694 2018-09-13 09:30:21 even non-stans KNOW how valuable hyuna is and it's even stated in the articles how much the other ptg members AND THE STOCKS APPARENTLY don't want hyojong to go ... cube honey ... what kinda dumb shit are you pulling ...
2695 2018-09-13 09:30:19 Wait, so let me get this straight. 
1. Cube didn’t even tell Hyuna or E’Dawn, they had to learn the news like us. 
2. After their stocks dropped, it is now “not finalized” and decision will be made next week? 
3. But then it apparently is final. 
This company is over.
2696 2018-09-13 09:29:10 @cubeunited y’all really messed up. This isn’t just gonna slide yknow. It’s barely been hours and stocks already fell.
2697 2018-09-13 09:28:51 Y'all talking bout cube stocks. Haters, compared to 2017, they are doing way better. And comparrd to the first time the news out a month ago, they are doing much better. But am not stock analyst. But anyway, this whole thing is a mess.
2698 2018-09-13 09:28:25 Bumaba stocks eh. Hyuna tatanggalin mo eh halos yan bumuhay sa Cube simila 4minute era pa? Wrong move talaga 
2699 2018-09-13 09:28:09 There is plenty else I would start with if I were trolling. For starters why don’t you earr money the honest way instead of pumping stocks w/o disclosure midam consulting?
2700 2018-09-13 09:28:01 Which stock are to buy, if i want to buy gold stocks? Are you investing directly into gold?
2701 2018-09-13 09:27:50 Immigration has always been under our control, we've chosen not to apply any brakes or 3 month rules

Fishery policy was all about conservation of fish stocks, we were fishing certain species to extinction, the CFP has resulted in Sustainability
2702 2018-09-13 09:27:01 Will be making finger stocks to go with neck and hand stock
2703 2018-09-13 09:26:16 FNO stocks are liquid and have less slippages. I trade in Stock Futures only so I get order fills without having any problem to chase them. Also, slippage is different than trading costs (brokerage,stt,excise,taxes..etc). Limit orders will minimize slippages.
2704 2018-09-13 09:25:57 just say you dw your stocks to drop LOL got the guts to kick them out now wanna keep them again
2705 2018-09-13 09:25:01 Easy tak easy..but still mcm stupid gila terminated terus hahaha! Stocks dh drop terus gelabah buat meeting and ckp tak final 
2706 2018-09-13 09:24:52 Bet they be like “oh shiet what have we done. We need to get them stocks up again” 
“Hey hyuna Baby girl-“
2707 2018-09-13 09:24:51 Cube: *kicks hyuna and edawn*
   *stocks started to drop*
 Cube: *realizes that they just lost their aces* wait! just kidding pls come back!
2708 2018-09-13 09:24:27 Even if Cube takes it all back to save their desperately plummeting stocks, if I were Hyuna or E'Dawn, I wouldn't even grace Cube with my rejection. I'd let the company quietly sink to the ground and take the artists with me. #CubeIsOverParty #cubeiscancelledparty
2709 2018-09-13 09:24:26 Nike is one of the stocks that pays dividends, and is currently at an all time high. I guarantee a lot of rich people own stock in Nike, so you idiots who are banning and burning, are hurting whom, exactly?
2710 2018-09-13 09:24:02 so....wow cube, always being professional!!!!! , anyway i hope they seriously leave that shitty place now after all this shit , so you kick them out and when the stocks go down you say it’s not confirmed?! LMAO what a joke!!! 
you lost blue square... you LOST!
2711 2018-09-13 09:23:48 The issue with scallops in thr BdS highlights the future needs for ratified mngt decisions for shared stocks based on sound bioeconomic & wider ecosystem science. Sound mngt plans are 1 thing, level of CS alloc are another, but can be part of a maintainable mngt plan.
2712 2018-09-13 09:23:19 They saw their stocks plummeting and back tracked realll quick
2713 2018-09-13 09:23:16 my cognitive abilities have been dropping these days just like cube's stocks I apologize .-.
2714 2018-09-13 09:22:45 lol cube screwing up their company isn't evrn 1% to describe what they've done
may the stocks continue to fall
2715 2018-09-13 09:22:18 Nah he just saw their stocks dropping quick
2716 2018-09-13 09:22:09 Basically cube being an idiot and kicking Hyuna and EDawn out and then karma showing them their aukaad as their stocks plummeted and then Cube's like "haha no wait we were kidding lol"
2717 2018-09-13 09:22:06 What if he is correct, and Mogg brought the kids out to the argument? Will you demand that Mogg is put in the stocks ? I'm happy to agree to either.
2718 2018-09-13 09:21:43 it gets wilder, they found out they were kicked through media, stocks dropped, now cube is rethinking dropping them
2719 2018-09-13 09:20:54 cube: we are kicking out edawn and hyuna because we are allergic to our artists’ happiness and nothing can change our mind about it

[cube stocks drops]

cube: nah we were just playin
2720 2018-09-13 09:20:37 i know and now they're saying that it isn't confirmed yet lol is it because their stocks are rapidly going down?  theyre fcked up
2721 2018-09-13 09:20:35 I fucking can't at this I'm becoming hysterical at all the news and reactions...I was waiting for an official from Cube to push Edawn out onto the stage with no knowledge of his part or the choreo to keep their stocks from plummeting
2722 2018-09-13 09:20:17 Thank you.. I am testing a system for stocks and was wondering how much slippage should be considered 
For nifty it should not be more than 2 points as it is very liquid
2723 2018-09-13 09:20:12 "they have changed their stance"

Gee, I wonder why? Maybe cause their stocks dropped badly after that?
2724 2018-09-13 09:20:03 i guess now she is not the one who is making money for the entire company also cube entertainment stocks drop following the dating rumors which is not a good sign for business
2725 2018-09-13 09:19:57 perhaps they saw their stocks going down JDJF this company is cancelled
2726 2018-09-13 09:19:12 Wait who broke the news of the stocks dropping btwjabss
2727 2018-09-13 09:19:11 ang baba na ng stocks ng cube
2728 2018-09-13 09:18:46 Wow so u guys @cubeunited just forget how much hyuna and hyojong have created so much impact on the kpop industry. just because of some fucking hate comments u kicked them out?!? U do realize that your stocks are dropping low right?! and i won't longer support u guys sorry
2729 2018-09-13 09:18:19 lmao they saw their stocks plummeting and realized they fucked up 
2730 2018-09-13 09:18:08 You don't find many in the food banks. The money spent on breaking a gentleman's agreement & defying French law that aims to prevent depleting fishing stocks might be better spent elsewhere.
2731 2018-09-13 09:18:06 when you're gone for an hour and you come back to non existent cube stocks hmmMmmmmM
2732 2018-09-13 09:17:52 oo grabe dbaaaa "tHey CanT tRusT tHem" daw  ayun grabe pagbaba nung stocks nila sobrang drasti,,  paalisin nyo ba naman si hyuna na nagpapayaman sa inyo zzzz
2733 2018-09-13 09:17:42 CUBE's stocks went down when HyunA confirmed that she's dating.
CUBE's stocks went DOWN DOWN DOWN when HyunA got "kicked out" of CUBE.
.
NOW TELL ME THAT HYUNA IS IRRELEVANT TO CUBE. PAKIEXPLAIN NA HINDI SIYA ANG BUMUBUHAY AT NAGPAPASOK NG PERA SA CUBE.
2734 2018-09-13 09:17:09 so basically they saw that their stocks dropped by 7+% and they were like hMMMM MAYBE WE SHOULDVE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS
2735 2018-09-13 09:16:56 They took them back after their stocks hit rock bottom
2736 2018-09-13 09:16:53 i don’t think cube knows what they’re doing. trying to back track now it seems. probably saw how much their stocks were dropping an said oh sike.
2737 2018-09-13 09:16:42 They probably saw their stocks going down nd regretted everything
2738 2018-09-13 09:16:29 I have memories of very happy holidays at Stocks
2739 2018-09-13 09:16:17 Hmmm looks like someone is reagreting their diseason all of a sudden.  Yeah it ain't the same running their mouth to seeing the consequences ...stocks going down down down~

2741 2018-09-13 09:14:58 cube suddenly not confirming that they kicked hyojong and hyuna out of their ent after they see their stocks dropping lmao bye
2742 2018-09-13 09:14:36 The fuck. Cube see's their stocks falling and now suddenly says they want them back. Kinda hypocritical for the ones saying "could not maintain trust with them"
2743 2018-09-13 09:14:18 They tryna get their money back their stocks r free falling
2744 2018-09-13 09:13:52 Well their stocks are decreasing so now they have come up with some bullshit ..
2745 2018-09-13 09:13:32 恥ずかしいセリフは禁止なんだよなぁ
2746 2018-09-13 09:12:43 Cubes stocks dropping is what they deserve
2747 2018-09-13 09:12:00 Idk what would I do if I were Hyuna or E'Dawn. Cube kicked them out, but after their stocks started to drop, they suddenly realised that it's bad for them to get rid of two really really talented people and now "it's not final"? The fuck, Cube?
2748 2018-09-13 09:11:48 the stocks hasnt updated for awhile HJDHFJD
2749 2018-09-13 09:11:47 Random thought: When an entertainment company terminates their contract with their most well known solo female artist and one of the most well known members of a rising boy group their stocks just might drop
Who would've thought, right?
2750 2018-09-13 09:11:35 cube: well you two are kicked out of the company
cube’s stocks: -10%
cube: we were joking go tf back:D
2751 2018-09-13 09:10:54 we're still waiting for our supplier to confirm stocks for eribong, then we'll open a GO asap so it would arrive in time for #MBCShowChampMNL2018
2752 2018-09-13 09:10:49 Did you know that part of the standard compensation for FT (perm) associates includes stocks in the company throughout their career?  There are quite a few of us that have a piece of the Co.
2753 2018-09-13 09:10:48 cube actin as if they arent losing two of their biggest artists and ruining three careers at the same time resulting in them losing stocks eye have to CACKLE

2757 2018-09-13 09:10:19 Do Apple seriously expect me to consider spending £1,000 to incrementally upgrade my already decent iPhone? 

Now selling nudes, £20 each while stocks last. 50 available.

Damn you, capitalism 
2758 2018-09-13 09:10:04 As of now the benefit is going to be marginally positive only...It won't cause a cyclical turnaround...But there will be enough price rise in sugar stocks to help distribute to small retail investors
2759 2018-09-13 09:09:57 I'm not even a fan but kicking E-dawn and Hyuna (YOUR FRICKIN MONEY MAKER) out of your label for doing one of their rights as people a.k.a loving, is just pure shit. Anyway, good luck to your stocks/shares/etc. Wish yall luck lol. #CubeIsOverParty #CubeisCancelled #EXOCOMEBACKPLS
2760 2018-09-13 09:09:53 Lakas ng topak ng cube amputa. Bumaba lang stocks, binawi na? Odiba? Laking kawalan ng money maker niyong si HyunA?????????
2761 2018-09-13 09:09:47 OMG Cube is such a mess right now. Hoping Hyuna and E’Dawn decides not to go back to them. They changes their mind because stocks falling. That’s fuck up. You two are better to be on a company that will respect your relationship and will give importance to your talent.
2762 2018-09-13 09:08:50 Lmao cube has the audacity to kicked hyuna out? lets see how cube’s stocks go down

2765 2018-09-13 09:08:02 Thanks sir. Your tweet did give strength to my thought and I entered and squared off with profit.  I saw it as a Tweezers ( Alone with Ambuja) . New thought to study among sector stocks. 
2766 2018-09-13 09:07:56 c*be’s stocks: [PLUMMET]
c*be: Oh No shitshitshit ... SIKE Y’ALL THEY NOT KICKED OUT ᵖˡᵉᵃˢᵉ ᵍᶦᵛᵉ ᵘˢ ᵇᵃᶜᵏ ᵒᵘʳ ᵐᵒⁿᵉʸ
2767 2018-09-13 09:07:41 At this point I would just leave that damn place and let them burn. This is either media play from the beginning or they panicked when they saw stocks dropping faster than my chemistry grade in highschool 
2768 2018-09-13 09:07:37 bahalag di na sila mo balik oy, magkagamay nuon ang stocks sa cube. pero nagkasikat man sad ang idle.
2769 2018-09-13 09:07:35 “And get the GOOD s*it because the value of our stocks in Boeing & Raytheon are about to SKYROCKET!”
2770 2018-09-13 09:07:15 Cube: *kicks out hyuna and edawn, angered the fans, experiences a drastic drop in stocks*

Hyuna and Edawn: 

Cube: ...... I'm sorry. Please come back. We need you more than you need us. 

Basically cube is just that one ex who still "loves" you and won't leave you alone
2771 2018-09-13 09:07:14 more like

kicked out
not informed
and then cube decided to retract their statement bc stocks went down
2772 2018-09-13 09:06:24 Syet dami kong stocks na pagkain hahaha foodtrip tayo kay mhangkut
2773 2018-09-13 09:06:23 Oh aye, shandy’s were they 
2774 2018-09-13 09:06:19 They kicked out hyuna and edawn then their stocks went down and now they saying they are not kicking them out??? Im not sure myself
2775 2018-09-13 09:05:47 Hyuna and Hyojong better find a BETTER and MORE SENSIBLE company. If Cube begs them to return in case stocks and sales get affected, they BETTER NOT give Cube the second chance. It doesn't deserve. This is the last thing we wanna see today. Rest in piss, Cube.
2776 2018-09-13 09:05:46 Hey Lorna! We don't have a centralised tracking system to track down stocks I am afraid  Why not give the store a call: 01452 500271 or have a look on our TK Maxx website for the wreaths  Emma
2777 2018-09-13 09:05:43 Great tweet Tom! A timely reminder that I can't kiss all the babies & keep taking on more & more trades. May I ask how do you determine that it's time to say no? Is it the number of stocks you can manage? The % of your portfolio invested? The % of open risks you have? Or others?
2778 2018-09-13 09:05:28 Cube Ent. stocks are going to drop fast. Hyuna is a big part of Cube. Biggest mistake they'll ever make. First Beast (Highlight) left and now they're kicking out Hyuna? The two biggest money makers of Cube. #CubeIsOverParty #HYUNADESERVESBETTER

2790 2018-09-13 09:02:40 I’m up $30 this week with my stocks/crypto investments, I’m currently basking in the praise of random strangers over a clever tweet AND I just hit 120 in WoW. Today has been a good day.
2791 2018-09-13 09:02:10 "Cube Entertainment take back their decision about kicking out Hyuna and E'Dawn"

LOL WHAT'S THIS? A CHANGE OF HEART? OR MAYBE BC YOUR STOCKS ARE NOW AT ITS LOWEST AND YOU REALIZED THAT THESE TWO ARE UR BREADWINNERS 
#CubeIsCancelled
2792 2018-09-13 09:02:09 BITCH THEIR HOLDING A MEETING TO POSSIBLY RETHINK KICKING OUT HYUNA AND E'DAWN. They fucking saw their stocks going down and was like "shit son, we made a mistake"
2793 2018-09-13 09:02:07 CHINA: stocks finally bounce +1.2% overnight but remain Bearish TREND @Hedgeye
2794 2018-09-13 09:02:04 @ Cube y'all really threw out Hyuna.. the only artist that actually made you relevant??? 
what's going on.. you lost Beast, your greatest boy group, and now Hyuna???
challenge try to keep stocks up: FAILED
2795 2018-09-13 09:01:43 they saw their stocks dropping and freaked
2796 2018-09-13 09:01:43 lol cube saw their stocks going downhill and was like "haha .... just kidding .... edawn? .... hyuna? .... p-please come back"
2797 2018-09-13 09:01:08 lmfao cube probably regretted their 
decision & changed their mind due 
to the drastic drop on stocks ctfu
2798 2018-09-13 09:01:02 I don't know. That's so annoying, and now when they saw all the comments and their stocks after the decision they are ""reconsidering" is. They handled this situation in the worst way possible.
2799 2018-09-13 09:01:01 No wonder their stocks just decline to almost zero after their announcement
2800 2018-09-13 09:00:54 After saw their stocks going down they say it's unofficial. CUBE is drama agency though. LOL
2801 2018-09-13 09:00:37 But it seems like it's not just Allkpop that released the article, cube entertainment said it themselves, not they say that Edawn and Hyuna are still part of Cube because of stocks
2802 2018-09-13 09:00:31 ang gago naman pala ng cube. bigla niyong sasabihin na hindi pa confirmed after bumaba stocks niyo?
2803 2018-09-13 09:00:31 Cube after realising their following has dropped just as quick as their stocks: bITCH WE GOTTA DO SUMN
2804 2018-09-13 09:00:13 Get these genuine leather products at Cape Fashion.

2805 2018-09-13 09:00:12 Im sorry if i said without knowing all of it(news). I just saw the tweet rn about cube changing their stance with regards their decision, and i guess they just got slap to the truth  with their stocks rate goin' down.
2806 2018-09-13 09:00:03 Lmaooo cube probably saw their stocks / livelihood / worth plunged before their eyes therefore they retracted back their statement lmao
2807 2018-09-13 09:00:02 Poverty is unnecessary! forex stocks investment
2808 2018-09-13 08:59:27 cube just changed their stance about kicking hyuna and hyojung when they saw their stocks drop 
2809 2018-09-13 08:59:21 WAIT WHAT IF CUBE SAID THEY’RE “NEGOTIATING WITH EDAWN AND HYUNA” BECAUSE THEY NEED TO SAVE WHATS LEFT OF THEIR STOCKS
2810 2018-09-13 08:59:08 they probs saw the rate of their stocks dippin and now they tryna save their ass
2811 2018-09-13 08:59:00 #CubeisCanceled #CubeIsOverParty get ready to be called square entertainment as your stocks go flat to the ground sweetie :)))
2812 2018-09-13 08:58:54 Honestly if I was Hyuna or E'Dawn I wouldn't agree to come back. They basically kicked them out without consulting with them & once their stocks dropped they went crying back to them. If I were Hyuna I'd demand a compensation or something. But unfortunately I doubt that'll happen
2813 2018-09-13 08:58:42 Stocks prices have been artificially inflated with stock buybacks.
US debt is SOARING.
Wages are flat and priced are rising while the rich get richer.

2816 2018-09-13 08:58:05 Cube only care about their stocks ...
2817 2018-09-13 08:57:52 Di pa daw sure yung pagkick ng Cube kay Hyuna at Edawn jusq natakot si Cube bumaba kasi stocks, kung ako kay Hyuna lalayas na talaga ako don tas mag isang company na lang sila ng Highlight jusme

2821 2018-09-13 08:56:59 CUBE: ok let’s kick them OUT they love each other we CANT TRUST THEM 
‘em stocks: HA BYEEE 
CUBE: oh no we meant no harm we’ll think it over give us a sec we’ll solve this we’re sorry 
#CubeIsCancelled
2822 2018-09-13 08:56:56 so hyuna and hyojong found out that they were kicked out from cube through the articles, talked to cube about it, and cube basically changed their stance (lbr their stocks plummeting was partially the reason too). they’re still talking about it right now.

make up your mind, cube
2823 2018-09-13 08:56:54 Watching Cube's stocks drop is entertaining to me because all it shows me is how goddamn stupid they are for firing two individuals with talent who experienced a human emotion with each other.
2824 2018-09-13 08:56:27 Hyuna leaves Cube taking her stocks, and profit with her for the past years. #CubeisCanceled #cubeiscancelledparty
2825 2018-09-13 08:56:05 Why is it illogical AJ wants FB to publish his message on their website & the gay couple wanted the baker to publish their message on his cake. Both AJ & the gay couple want to use big Gov to force a private companies to do want they want. I say let the free market decide not Gov
2826 2018-09-13 08:55:48 I have a feeling that if I go into stocks, it’ll eat up most of my time 
2827 2018-09-13 08:55:39 god cube really saw their stocks plummeting and decided to say "april fools" like what the fuck is wrong with them playing with people's emotions like this??????
2828 2018-09-13 08:55:29 @linnypo stocks are dropping
2829 2018-09-13 08:55:12 They already have their stocks are going down karma is a bitch yooooo
2830 2018-09-13 08:55:03 cubes stocks took another dive because of this thread
2831 2018-09-13 08:54:34 preee nakita ng cube stocks nila!! Aghh di pa finaaal
2832 2018-09-13 08:54:12 None taken.  I just don't agree when you said they don't want to sacrifice  their other artists when they've been neglecting CLC. And I think they put their artists at stake when they kicked the two out. The stocks went downhill and it'll affect all their artists coz of that.
2833 2018-09-13 08:53:56 hm but how will it benefit cube? currently their stocks are dropping like mad
2834 2018-09-13 08:53:32 Public & confirmed meetings will be  Bullish for stocks.
2835 2018-09-13 08:53:27 Cube knows the screwed up after their stocks dropped so much because they kicked out queen hyuna
2836 2018-09-13 08:53:13 they’re probably shaking right now. plus their stocks are obvs going down after they reveal such news.
2837 2018-09-13 08:53:09 So now cube be saying it isnt an official thing of getting them kicked out, psshh they be saying that after seeing how low their stocks are going, realizing they are fucked without HyunA and E'dawn, smh Cube. Karma is a bitch haha.#FuckCubeEnt
2838 2018-09-13 08:53:07 Cube looks unprofessional as hell now lol look at their lying asses back pedaling when their stocks dropped binches u don't even deserve Hyuna's toenails
2839 2018-09-13 08:52:53 That stocks joke isn’t even funny?
Yall complaining about how cube isn’t handling this issue the right way but look who’s making up childish jokes? Non-stans.
2840 2018-09-13 08:52:45 BAHAHAHAHA what a joke. since stocks have plummeted to the depths of hell i hope the happy couple stay away and find success in their own pursuits away from cube’s grubby mitts
2841 2018-09-13 08:52:13 Cube ruined 2 lives. Edawn’s and their own. Hyuna is already established. Their stocks are plummeting.
2842 2018-09-13 08:52:09 Lol ofc their stock dropping. Why did they think all the ahjussis buying their stocks if it's not because Kim Hyuna lol.
2843 2018-09-13 08:51:58 stocks is the most important lmao Cube.
2844 2018-09-13 08:51:55 i'm still shocked tbh, until they said now it's "not sure" because stocks price decreased down their ass
2845 2018-09-13 08:51:47 cubes stocks dropped so they were like hmmm
2846 2018-09-13 08:51:40 Cube are playing us. They say there kicking their most successful idols out of their company and BOOM. THE STOCKS PLUMMET LIKE ITS THE END OF THR WORLD. 
Now they’ve seen that and are trying to lie by saying they’re reconsidering it?
BAHAHAHA TALK TO THE HAND
2847 2018-09-13 08:51:29 You woke up to cubes stocks plummeting
2848 2018-09-13 08:51:23 You kicked them out of Cube.
Reason? 
Because Hyuna & Edawn fell in love with each other and you were pissed.
They read about their dismissal from the company via headlines and now Cube's stocks be falling and the company be backtracking on dem words.
The audacity.
2849 2018-09-13 08:50:32 cube rly thought abt their other artists after their stocks dropped like dumbs
2850 2018-09-13 08:50:32 bodo la cube  maybe they see their stocks plummeting pastu baru nak kelam kabut change their stance hahah
2851 2018-09-13 08:50:22 Wow cube you must be really surprised seeing your stocks fall off just like that, so you changed your mind again??? But sweetie the damage has been done....
2852 2018-09-13 08:50:16 You've definitely come along at a tough time - but the good news is there are many easier times !! Are you buying AIM Garbage or proper Quality Stocks?
2853 2018-09-13 08:50:12 Asian stocks and currencies gained as the U.S. proposes another round of trade talks with China.
2854 2018-09-13 08:49:59 So, Cube kicked HyunA and E’Dawn out cause they “lost their trust” in the couple and once they saw their stocks plummet, they we like  “wait a darn diddly second, HyunA keeps us a float. We’ll reconsider kicking them out”
#CubeIsOver
2855 2018-09-13 08:49:52 cube rly decided the other artists' opinions were important after their stocks dropped faster than the shawty with the apple bottom jeans & the boots with the fur who hit the floor and had the whole club looking at her
2856 2018-09-13 08:49:39 @jtepper2 Hi Jonathan. What book should I read to understand market timing like you guys do at varient perception. I find that my macro outlook is right and that my outlook for stocks is mostly correct but I take a beating sometimes due to poor timing. Please Help
2857 2018-09-13 08:49:18 Cube sees their stocks plummet after their announcement of letting Hyuna & Hyojong go from their agency & now they've had a sudden change of "heart" & are "further discussing the matter"!? 
#HYUNADESERVESBETTER #EDAWNDESERVESBETTER
2858 2018-09-13 08:49:13 Wag niyo tularan yung Cube! pabago bago ng decision. Bumama lang stocks iniba na yung statement. Di na lang umamin na takot sila dahil baka bumaba ng husto yung stocks nila bwiseeet ><
2859 2018-09-13 08:49:07 & now cube took back their statement looool????????? they saw their stocks dropping 
2860 2018-09-13 08:48:42 Lmao the backpedaling. The abysmal state of their stocks was probably a wakeup call for Cube but Hyuna and Edawn don't deserve to be jerked around like this.
2861 2018-09-13 08:48:27 LMFAO I was legit telling Jeremy earlier tonight that cube was gonna know they fucked up as soon as the stocks dropped and come crawling back to both of them crying
2862 2018-09-13 08:47:58 how is kicking hyuna out going to save your stocks? hyuna literally made that company what the fuck is cube besides hyuna. fools
2863 2018-09-13 08:47:43 its so funny how they changed their statement just like that AFTER THEIR STOCKS PRICES DROP LIKE A BOMB LOL
2864 2018-09-13 08:47:35 their stocks going down suddenly they cant make up their mind

2867 2018-09-13 08:46:50 What about Stocks?
2868 2018-09-13 08:46:42 Now you’re talking!
2869 2018-09-13 08:46:11 Cube just realized they did suicide mission firing one of their breadwinner and best producer after their stocks jumped off the bridge. Suddenly another article released saying they're not fired..yet and still under discussion LMAO biggest twist in kpop this year.
2870 2018-09-13 08:46:10 cube after their stocks dropped harder than the beat: ⁿᵒ ʷᵃᶦᵗ ᶦˢˢᵃ ʲᵒᵏᵉ
2871 2018-09-13 08:46:08 Btw of course they need to hold an urgent meeting since their stocks drop after the news released. 
2872 2018-09-13 08:45:47 If hyuna left cube and nothing to cube why their stocks fall down when news hyuna and edawn kicked by cube ? Can you explain that ?
2873 2018-09-13 08:45:34 cube’s stocks are going down Damn !

2876 2018-09-13 08:44:06 yall can try to save your stocks but the damage has already been done
2877 2018-09-13 08:44:02 I feel something more than just the artist removal is going on within. It is more like a power play. Someone did this intentionally to buy more stocks. It can not be as dumb as it sounds.
2878 2018-09-13 08:43:57 TD. Main interest is expanding assett prices indefinatly! Especialy US stocks. Please inform to all when policy changes, not just to Goldman and JP .

2882 2018-09-13 08:43:23 *cube kicks hyuna and edawn out*

*looks at stocks*

cube: OH FUCK BRING THEM BACK
2883 2018-09-13 08:43:18 You do know that the UK drove the agenda to reduce fishing fleets to preserve fish stocks and then sold the licenses abroad. Our government killed our own fishing industry and they won’t rebuild it. It’s not worth it in their view.
2884 2018-09-13 08:42:57 and now cube is saying that they arent removing hyojong and hyuna from their label??? what, now that they see how their stocks dropped in sales after the announcement they suddenly regret the decision?????
2885 2018-09-13 08:42:45 They saw their stocks dropping down to hell and changed their opinion huh. Fuck you cube you ain't shit hbdhdbd
2886 2018-09-13 08:42:43 ok so... it isnt confirmed? cube u better not fuck up. u already played with all of our feelings LIKE U ALWAYS HAVE BEEN since last time z they prolly changed their minds aft their stocks went DOWN THE DRAIN

cube stocks: 
literally everyone: 
cube: lol um, we mean, we’re just discussing it, nothings final yet...
2888 2018-09-13 08:42:23 #CubeIsOverParty yall really just kicked out two of your loyal artists? for falling in love? hyuna and hyojong contributed so much to why your stocks increased in the first place. enjoy your fucking downfall. ps petition to free cube artists from this company, they deserve better
2889 2018-09-13 08:42:19 so cube says they're dropping e'dawn and hyuna, then their stocks drop drastically and they're like whoo sed dat. fuckin crackheads i hate them
2890 2018-09-13 08:42:16 Niubos man daw ila stocks mao na ila gi 'rethink' ila desicion hahaha mga bogo
2891 2018-09-13 08:42:13 Awww... someone had regrets when those stocks went down. Not to mention the backlash of that dumb decision for kicking them out, was 10 times worst than the announcement of them dating.
Cube looking like fools as usual.
2892 2018-09-13 08:42:10 Probably Cube must've regret it after seeing their stocks dropping that's why they released another statement regarding Hyuna & E'Dawn's widrawal lmao 
2893 2018-09-13 08:41:45 The main ways in which the middle class holds its wealth, stocks and real estate, have yielded poorer returns in the Modi years than the previous five UPA years, right?
2894 2018-09-13 08:41:44 taking #HyunA and #Edawn back because their stocks dropped in an hr
2895 2018-09-13 08:41:31 Cube realizing what a huge loss Hyuna and Edawn is to their company. They’re def diggin their own grave. Stocks are going down. smh 
2896 2018-09-13 08:41:29 Very happy memories with this fantastic production! It was my first role as a tenor, my first G&S, and definitely helped me along the way... This year, to this point alone I’ve had nearly 50 performances of G&S! Hope to see you all again soon! X
2897 2018-09-13 08:41:21 Oh so now that their stocks are dropping they take it back. The fact that they even concidered kicking them out just because they’re dating is disgusting
2898 2018-09-13 08:40:54 we didn't say it was true haha it's just discussions please buy our stocks it was a joke guys A JOKE stop falling pls
2899 2018-09-13 08:40:47 Oo kung di naman bumaba stocks nila di mag gaganyan yan e
2900 2018-09-13 08:40:39 Cube: you cant hang out with us

Hyuna & E'Dawn:

Stocks:

Cube: sucks to suck

Hyuna & E'dawn:

Stocks: 

Cube: wait a minute--
2901 2018-09-13 08:40:34 Lol cube saw them stocks and said rewind were gonna need to take that whole statement back. Dumbasses. But I’m reading Hyuna & Edawn found out they were kicked through news articles... idk how they’re gonna fix this bruh
2902 2018-09-13 08:40:16 If you want cube's stocks to fall down, please unfollow their official account (@cubeunited) 

#hyuna #edawn #hyojong #pentagon #cube
2903 2018-09-13 08:40:15 Tha’s never seen 9 peents on a satdy never mind a school neet
2904 2018-09-13 08:40:07 Then they retracted their statement bc their stocks plummeted. And said they are “discussing”
2905 2018-09-13 08:40:03 The kpop industry is the worst, can't even have a regular live. Why so many of the artists become depressed. Just watch Cube stocks taking a dive
2906 2018-09-13 08:40:03 Lmao they saw their stocks dropping to hell and QUICKLY changed their stance
2907 2018-09-13 08:40:02 As soon as they saw that their stocks are fluctuating, they announced that removing Edawn and Hyuna isn't confirmed yet. Lol. Cube, wtf?
2908 2018-09-13 08:39:59 non mais attend dès qu'ils ont annoncé qu'ils foutaient elle et edaw'n à la porte leurs stocks à commencer à baisser DIRECT du coup ils ont changé d'avis ils savent pas si ils vont les garder ou pas

2910 2018-09-13 08:39:58 Halatadong mas may pakialam sila sa stocks nila kesa sa welfare ng mga artist nila XD
2911 2018-09-13 08:39:57 They must be in panic when their stocks drop lol Cube is total trash
2912 2018-09-13 08:39:52 Wa nila gidayon mamsh kay ka feel guro sla ni low ilang stocks hahahaha
2913 2018-09-13 08:39:43 im laughing
cube: hyuna and edawn have been kicked out
cube's stocks: fucking plummet 
cube: wait nvm sike just kidding we're still talking about it 
2914 2018-09-13 08:39:34 Someone in power probably said that theyre kicking them out and when saw the stocks..and someone higher than them is like 'wtf are u saying' 
2915 2018-09-13 08:39:13 so a representative from cube said that they are still negotiating hyojong and hyuna about the "kick-out" issue they released earlier. what's wt the sudden change of heart, honey? bcos your stocks are dropping aggressively? poor you.
2916 2018-09-13 08:39:13 Oh man this was such a special production!  We so need a reunion. 
2917 2018-09-13 08:39:12 now where are these people who are saying cube made the right decision of kicking them out when cube's out here now doing all their best to save their stocks
2918 2018-09-13 08:39:08 Does everyone knows how stocks work?? Bc I find it hella funny how everyone is selling their stock they had from cube,,, that must’ve meant that Hyuna and Edawn leaving means that the stock holders don’t see a future anymore for cube lmao
2919 2018-09-13 08:39:06 This week, 4 Kenyan Stocks touched their Lowest levels since Listing at the NSE;

2920 2018-09-13 08:39:02 I thought only sethinomics makes that kind of money bcoz from his tweets always his stocks are roaring... With that kind of ability and returns he should be already in Forbes list.. 

But he is also the guy who wants LTCG to be taken out, FM must go and worried abt GDP, SEBI.
2921 2018-09-13 08:38:57 MAYBE BC THEIR STOCKS CRASHED OHOULJOHDOHFE
2922 2018-09-13 08:38:54 LMAO cube saw how much their stocks went down and went "shit we did a bad move" FCKING BYE
2923 2018-09-13 08:38:54 not sure how taking back their word would help gain their stocks back lmfao dumbfucks. hyuna & edawn should just really leave tbh. if they choose to stay with them, they'd be saints at this point.
2924 2018-09-13 08:38:42 after that information ws released their stocks dropped downhill SOOO fast in a matter of minutes they probably went "You know what wait a second-"
2925 2018-09-13 08:38:40 cube’s falling stocks is highly amusing to me
2926 2018-09-13 08:38:21 Stocks nya turun sampai 7% katanya kakk wow parah
2927 2018-09-13 08:38:11 ils ont déjà changé de décision parce que leurs stocks à baisser dès leur annonce du coup ils savent pas si ils vont les garder ou pas j'ai les nerfs
2928 2018-09-13 08:37:31 Exactly people r talking about cube. It’s a hot topic today and these stocks will go right back up by the end of the week or soon cube is gonna come out and say something that will please us all and say we never confirmed it or it was all rumour they r still in cube.
2929 2018-09-13 08:37:27 Cube doesn’t deserve any of its artists. I’m glad their stocks are plummeting, I hope hyuna leaves #CubeIsOverParty
2930 2018-09-13 08:37:12 good company better hire them before cube does the begging since their stocks are going down
2931 2018-09-13 08:37:02 cube ils ont grave shake avec voyant leurs stocks baisser
2932 2018-09-13 08:36:57 i keep talking about stocks bc that's all that matters to these companies ..... they were so willing to let go of such great artists and set aside their loyalty to each other just to make sure they don't lose money ...
2933 2018-09-13 08:36:53 Cube panicked after seeing their stocks dropped. Getting back Hyuna and Edawn after saying you kicked out them? 
2934 2018-09-13 08:36:47 Official accounts?? Wt?? U mean twitter or something like that?? No these kinds of news done through other ways
They have already stated through naver.. not leaked.. they did kicked. But now regretting seeing their stocks decreasing
2935 2018-09-13 08:36:36 Nasampolan sila ng pagbaba ng stocks agad agad di na nila alam gagawin nila hahahahah jusko
2936 2018-09-13 08:36:18 Also, I love people how people are saying their stocks plummeted, They clearly don't look at stocks, Their stocks have seen a fall for the past 5 days and its starting to stabilise. There stocks are still up from over a month ago, the news did nothing to their stocks
2937 2018-09-13 08:35:50 now that cube's stocks have dropped, suddenly hyuna and edawn getting kicked out isn't final yet. i hope they leave instead. cube really ain't shit 
2938 2018-09-13 08:35:46 #Stocks Observations (EMA PoV)
- Maruti 8 went below 200m 1st time in 2.5 yrs
- BN mostly revisits 50 from 100, rarely dropped to 200 directly
- SBIN MAs r lined up, hinting at good upmove(with/out Gap fill at 272)
- Tatasteel despite recent upmove, 200-100-50 r in same order
1/2
2939 2018-09-13 08:35:32 the fact that cube stocks went down drastically meant that whole south korea were informed about cube’s action wether cube released official statements or not
2940 2018-09-13 08:35:03 cube be like
KICKED OUT PRANK!! KICKED OUT TWO OF OUR BEST ARTISTS!! (GONE WRONG) (STOCKS DROPPED)
2941 2018-09-13 08:34:55 So they decided to kick them out over something stupid (you made us look like liars for lying, waaaah!!!), announced that shit to the public. Didn't even tell Hyuna or Edawn you were kicking them out. Backtrack when stocks and public sentiment went down. Talk about "trust", huh?
2942 2018-09-13 08:34:48 Ya sia. Really bye bye stocks!
2943 2018-09-13 08:34:35 Wait i left to watch anime did cube see their stocks plummeting and change their mind
2944 2018-09-13 08:34:12 Kala mo ngayon lang nakarinig ng dating scandal at di nila alam gawin. Ayan tuloy.. stocks nila grabe bagsak

2947 2018-09-13 08:33:13 Cube saw their stocks going down & got nervous 
2948 2018-09-13 08:33:06 Keep protesting guys. Our voice can make a difference. Their stocks are falling too . Hyuna and edawn don't deserve this , infact no one deserves this kind of behavior because they fell in love with someone
2949 2018-09-13 08:32:54 lmao i’m wheezing, cube was getting a lot of backlash and stocks going down and now hyuna and edawn are under discussion.
2950 2018-09-13 08:32:40 They should just tell cube to suck a dick and leave. LOL emergency meeting cause their stocks are gonna run aground by end of the day.
2951 2018-09-13 08:32:36 Cube is so ridiculous.

LIKE, they don't even tell Hyuna & E'Dawn & they found out via articles. NOW THE STOCKS ARE DROPPING (good) AND THEY TAKING BACK WHAT THEY SAID.

They mentioned trust. I'd say they just broke both Hyuna & E'Dawn's trust with this bullshit. Like, bitch???
2952 2018-09-13 08:32:35 cube is now thinking of getting hyojong and hyuna back bcos their stocks went down lmaooo
2953 2018-09-13 08:32:29 lmaoo mood is cube acting new and changing what they said bc they saw they stocks dropping n figured out that they were ruining their company
2954 2018-09-13 08:32:10 Haha apparemment maintenant ils retirent ce qu'ils disent et sont en discussion (... Pou mr sauver leurs stocks ?)

2961 2018-09-13 08:31:33 if i were hyuna and edawn i'd get the hell out of there, to have cube first announcing they're dropping them and then changing their minds after the stocks drop? it just proves they don't see them as human beings, but only as a source of income.
2962 2018-09-13 08:31:28 this is the only time i like looking at stocks lose value
2963 2018-09-13 08:31:22 cube saw her stocks and decided to bring back hyuna and hyojong they're trying to call them now when their initial statement said they were out
2964 2018-09-13 08:31:13 They saw their stocks plummeting.
2965 2018-09-13 08:31:11 Cube *throws Hyuna & Edawns suitcases to the curb* "bye hoes"

*Cube stocks took a dive*

Cube "GUYS wAIT WE WERE JUST PLAYIN!!!!"
2966 2018-09-13 08:30:53 Stocks plummeted so they were like "Nah nvm" lmao
2967 2018-09-13 08:30:43 watch cube crumble down to pieces because their stocks and sales are going down further . lmfao this is so fucking sad..
2968 2018-09-13 08:30:33 It’s in korean and am sure it came from them because why is it after their stocks go down before they can come and say oh no we haven’t yet decided Buh need more discussion doesn’t make sense at least to me
2969 2018-09-13 08:30:27 Lmao what even is cube did they peed their pants when their stocks started plunging
2970 2018-09-13 08:30:26 Stocks going down. 2 amazing artists are no longer in the company. Pentagon comeback with only 8 members.

Me: What are you trying to do, Cube Entertainment?
2971 2018-09-13 08:30:23 bumagsak stocks nila eh hahaha

2981 2018-09-13 08:29:19 Cube: We are kicking Edawn & Hyuna out without them allegedly knowing

"Cube watches their stocks fall for a good 5/6 hours"

Cube: I never said that, Edawn and Hyuna are my friends 

@cubeunited choke
2982 2018-09-13 08:29:15 Asian stocks rise on possible US-China talks amid tensions WALL STREET: U.S. stocks were mixed on Wednesday as technology companies fell, cancellng out gains in the energy sector. The S&P 500 index was less than 0.1 higher at 2,888.92. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained…
2983 2018-09-13 08:29:09 Cube's stocks have rapidly declined. Probably that's why
2984 2018-09-13 08:29:05 cube saw their stocks and said sike LMFAOOO
2985 2018-09-13 08:28:51 They saw their stocks dropping, and knew they fucked up

2990 2018-09-13 08:28:07 "Uh, mr ceo we have a situation"
"What?"
"The international backlash of the news is ruining us"
"....."
"And our stocks are dropping to an all time low" 
"....."
"Sir? What do we do"
"Call a meeting"
2991 2018-09-13 08:28:06 Cube wants to talk about trust issues? Honestly how trustworthy is a company that fires you through the media instead of face to face, but then wants to reconsider before it is "final" because their stocks drop and they get backlash.
2992 2018-09-13 08:28:00 Yun nga to think na di naman affected fans ni hyuna sa dating issue nya. Saka ang bilis ngdrop ng stocks nila after nung article kanina sooo business talaga. Kaya di talaga masisisi kung ganyan galawan ng cube.
2993 2018-09-13 08:27:38 Right after they saw their stocks drop lmao
2994 2018-09-13 08:27:24 see ur stocks drop like mad then now u want to change ur stance what’s ur problem lol hyuna and edawn will do fucking fine without u
2995 2018-09-13 08:27:22 Stocks have to be liquidated na 
2996 2018-09-13 08:27:22 Hyuna Edawn got kicked out by CUBE without them knowing, Cube watched their stocks fall and Now suddenly CUbe says that they have changed their decision about kicking them out its all a mess
2997 2018-09-13 08:27:18 Cube decided to take em back coz its stocks went down by 7% in an hour. Now i really hope that they dont go back to that shitty company.
2998 2018-09-13 08:27:07 celebrate cube stocks plummeting all yall want but its not gonna be fucking funny when you realize ALL remaining cube artists will suffer... clc, btob, (g)i-dle, INCLUDING pentagon
2999 2018-09-13 08:27:06 There is a conflict of interest - he owns apple stocks
3000 2018-09-13 08:26:56 Yeah now that the stocks are dropping they're changing stances. Icb, i hate cube so much. They're just playing with their lives for fucdjsjng dating and then taking them back for money. Hilarious
3001 2018-09-13 08:26:48 lol is cube changing their wording cause their stocks plummeted so much
3002 2018-09-13 08:26:39 Because you lost stocks and now u well telling that its not confirm yet.Its a big joke!
3003 2018-09-13 08:26:33 lol binawi ung decision. unti-unti kaseng bumagsak stocks noh? nako cube
3004 2018-09-13 08:26:07 AMEN!
But apparently Cube changed their mind a bit and now they want to "discuss" first. Basically they saw their stocks drop to the ground and yeah 
3005 2018-09-13 08:26:07 Cube is a fucking mess LMFAO their board should have a lengthy discussion their OICs. This has been going on for weeks. Their stocks might plummet more because of the instability of upper management
3006 2018-09-13 08:26:00 They saw their stocks drop
3007 2018-09-13 08:25:52 did cube just realized they made a huge mistake after looking at their stocks going downfall lol
3008 2018-09-13 08:25:48 When they saw their stocks
3009 2018-09-13 08:25:36 they prolly took it back after they saw their stocks going down
3010 2018-09-13 08:25:31 so first cube kicked them out and now after seeing their stocks flopped they want to discuss it once again? LMAOOOO they're being more and more pathetic
3011 2018-09-13 08:25:30 Cube: " Hyun A and E'dawn we will kick o..ut...''
Stocks are falling
Cube: "  didn't said we will kick oit, let's discuss 
3012 2018-09-13 08:25:29 They probably saw stocks going down, people flooding them with hate and thought: “oh shit lets re-discuss this” pieces of shit
3013 2018-09-13 08:25:27 U know what fuck u cube stay bankrupt they can do better than you anyway and I hope Pentagon follows Hyojong and finds a company that actually treats them professionally and like humans instead of like toys that they take out and bring in depending on stocks
3014 2018-09-13 08:25:26 how can cube just be like LMAO JUST KIDDING THEYRE NOT KICKED OUT when they literally released a statement saying they were ????? scared of the backlash??? didn’t want their stocks to fall more????  they’ve done the damage now they can’t change that
3015 2018-09-13 08:25:25 Cube: both of u L E A  V  e
Their stocks: *leaves with them*

Cube: on second thought maybe... you guys should stay for a bit...
3016 2018-09-13 08:25:09 @cubeunited FUCK U COWARDS UR UGLY AND I HOPE UR STOCKS DROP EVEN MORE !!!!
3017 2018-09-13 08:25:07 I know you are triggered, that’s why I said it. You shouldn’t blame others because they want to capitalize on your expertise, or lack there of. No one forced you to show us you have no clue about stocks. You did that all on your own & we thank you for it lol. #sharpasabowlingball
3018 2018-09-13 08:25:05 Wtf is wrong with Cube?! They've seen their stocks dropping so they cahnged their mind lmao shut up already
3019 2018-09-13 08:24:56 Imagine finding out youve lost your job via sns. For turn to come back pandering to you after the stocks plunged. I'd tell them to royally fuck themselves and stuff their entire company up their assholes #CubeIsOverParty
3020 2018-09-13 08:24:39 After they announced that the couple is gettin kicked out, their stocks dropped low LOL
3021 2018-09-13 08:24:38 cube: we're officially kicking hyojong and hyuna out of our company and you can't do anything about it lmfao
cube: ...
cube: [looks outside the window]
cube: [sees “STOCKS  195 (6.57%)]
cube: wayment....
3022 2018-09-13 08:24:20 Their stocks are literally crumbling down since they announced this shit.
3023 2018-09-13 08:24:06 They saw their stocks going down
Are you playing with us
3024 2018-09-13 08:23:41 1. News spread they were kicked out
2. News spread hyuna & hyojing learned about this via news articles. It was unilateral decision
3. Cube stocks tank
4. Cube releases statement that they changed stance. Hyuna and hyojong's dismissal is still under discussion
3025 2018-09-13 08:23:26 They saw their stocks fall and was like OH SHIT WE FUCKED UP
3026 2018-09-13 08:23:25 Entertainment stocks are really volatile lol
3027 2018-09-13 08:23:24 hyuna & edawn: date
cube: NO -kicks them out-
stocks: 
cube: JUST KIDDING WE’LL THINK ABOUT IT
3028 2018-09-13 08:23:21 and since their stocks plummeted, they changed their stance and said that their withdrawal is not yet final =))
3029 2018-09-13 08:23:19 Its so unprofessional that both of them find out, they where kicked out of the company from the headlines as if they dont have contract to follow. Then after knowing stocks went down they take back the claim? So pathetic for clout..
3030 2018-09-13 08:23:11 When they saw their stocks 
3031 2018-09-13 08:23:11 lmao saying bullshit just because their stocks are dropping pussy much cube
3032 2018-09-13 08:23:01 \\ HAHAHA OH MY GOD KARMA IS A BITCH

So... Hyuna and E'Dawn had to find out they've been kicked out of the company, Cube's stocks suddenly plummet, and now Cube backtracks their earlier statement and say that Hyuna and Hyojong's departure is 'not yet confirmed'?
3033 2018-09-13 08:22:59 They said they were “in talk to” but it wasn’t decided yet (or maybe it was but stocks drop so much that scares them). But, yes, they didn’t denied they were thinking about it.
3034 2018-09-13 08:22:58 akala ata ng cube ent. hindi bababa stocks nila sa ginawa nila kay hyuna and e.dawn 
3035 2018-09-13 08:22:57 They got scared their stocks dropped so drastically this hours lolo
3036 2018-09-13 08:22:51 cube : kicks out hyuna and edawn and sees the stocks going down too fast
also cube : wAIT SIKE it wasn’t confirmed that they have been kicked out
3037 2018-09-13 08:22:45 Cube really logged onto the internet & saw social media blowing up and their stocks dropping at a rapid pace and were like “lol just kidding :-) no one’s fired now!!”
3038 2018-09-13 08:22:43 @ cube just say you were more worried about your stocks and go
3039 2018-09-13 08:22:39 Apparently, CUBE kicked HyunA and E'Dawn. And suddenly, the stocks drop. I don't care about CUBE itself right now, I care about their artists. Especially PENTAGON. They're practically just rookies, they don't deserve that. HyunA will probably get scouted, but I'm worried for PTG.
3040 2018-09-13 08:22:39 From 4% to 6% stocks dropped  #CubeIsCancelledParty
3041 2018-09-13 08:22:37 I see Cube decided to rescind their decision after their stocks plummet
3042 2018-09-13 08:22:36 CUBE CHANGING THEIR STATEMENT AFTER SEEING THEIR STOCKS FALLING APART SJDJHSHSHS
3043 2018-09-13 08:22:28 Cube is now reconsidering their statement. You really think they gonna come back after all this? You saw how your stocks dropped and now you want them back. 
3044 2018-09-13 08:22:28 they saw those stocks drop real quick and went oH SHIT
3045 2018-09-13 08:22:25 Cube fucked up real good. PS there is no way your stocks are gonna rise up to the same level again pls
3046 2018-09-13 08:22:24 Cube retracted it just now because their stocks are plummeting 
3047 2018-09-13 08:22:15 Cause the minute they announced it their stocks crashed
3048 2018-09-13 08:22:14 cube: hyuna and edawn are out we cant trust them

stocks: 

cube: sike ! april fools
3049 2018-09-13 08:22:11 No, they change the statement cause cube stocks start to plummet, now they are trying to make Hyuna and Hyojong to say that they decided to leave on their own, not because CUBE fired them. SNAKE!!! I’m so mad right now
3050 2018-09-13 08:22:08 they are scared after their stocks plummeted badly
3051 2018-09-13 08:22:02 Sebab stocks jatuh le tuuu
3052 2018-09-13 08:21:59 Cube just saw their stocks plumment so they try to take back what they said 
But FUCK YALL
I hope Hyuna and Edawn sue you 
And if they decide to stay i hope they get their moneys

Altria .. & British American Tobacco gained most in a day since 2008, rising .. 7.7 % & 6.9 %, respectively"

3063 2018-09-13 08:20:39 Yeah. CUBE is "not kicking them out but discussing things"  They saw their stocks oof
3064 2018-09-13 08:20:20 cube saw their stocks plummet lmao
3065 2018-09-13 08:20:17 Insurance agents are the best people to troll once you are adequently covered (within your own planning) and have a basic understanding on how stocks works.
3066 2018-09-13 08:20:14 They really are. I’m never taking Cube seriously EVER. So they just found out their stocks plummeted after announcing their release of Hyuna and Edwan and decided to not let them go anymore. What a complete fucking joke
3067 2018-09-13 08:20:10 Wtf so now they are changing their minds after seeing their stocks drop
3068 2018-09-13 08:20:09 Sobrang shitty nila. Di nila ininform yung 2 na nakickout sila tapos ngayon biglang babawiin yung unang statement kasi bumabagsak stocks nila. Nkklk.
3069 2018-09-13 08:20:02 Cube is changing their stance bc they saw how their stocks dropped a lot and now theyre scared lmfaooo joke on you
3070 2018-09-13 08:19:55 cube said sike after their stocks dropped gjjsjf
3071 2018-09-13 08:19:47 Cube seeing their stocks plummet like oshit wE TAKE IT BACK
3072 2018-09-13 08:19:45 Pero di yun gantihan. Business pa rin yan kasi. Nagdrop yung stocks nila kaya binawi. Malaking factor kasi si Hyuna kasi malaki yung pangalan nya.
3073 2018-09-13 08:19:31 Pag yumaman talaga ako bibilhin ko stocks ng cube kingina
3074 2018-09-13 08:19:19 LMAO CUBE just say you’re trying to save your plummeting stocks and go
3075 2018-09-13 08:19:18 first cube kicked hyuna and edawn out WITHOUT having discussed that with both of them, then their stocks went down and they probably saw the massive amount of negative reactions and then they took their decision back to discuss the issue with hyuna and edawn... hypocrisy
3076 2018-09-13 08:19:15 All I got to say is that Cube got a snake in the building and they damaging your stocks
3077 2018-09-13 08:19:06 cube really acting all brave and shit until they saw their stocks dropping i have to laugh
3078 2018-09-13 08:19:02 Right?! Also imagine taking it back when their stocks dropped :))
3079 2018-09-13 08:18:37 their stocks literally dropped after they released their statement akdhajhahahaahhahaha
3080 2018-09-13 08:18:31 Karma is real Cube Entertainment. It's your lost. Your stocks is failing  #HYUNA #PENTAGON #EDAWN

These artists deserves better.
3081 2018-09-13 08:18:19 When I look across our assets, namely, global / EM / Energy stocks, Uranium / gold / nat gas / USTs I see renewed strength.  In some cases, a bounce in a probable ongoing downtrend.  Might be lightening the load shortly.
3082 2018-09-13 08:18:16 Their stocks going down and they're like oh shit wait we were just joking
3083 2018-09-13 08:18:11 i want more followers that are actually janky bots. weed sex free iphone vape harry potter stocks crunchyroll deep web stan loona
3084 2018-09-13 08:18:10 LUMABAS UNG STATEMENT NILA AFTER LUMABAS NA BUMABA UNG STOCKS NILA
3085 2018-09-13 08:18:04 Cube cant fire Hyuna, she fires Cube. Crash their stocks and make em go bankrupt.
3086 2018-09-13 08:18:03 JYPE stocks increased so much. damn i wish i bought some.
3087 2018-09-13 08:17:46 DROP THAT STOCKS RN.
3088 2018-09-13 08:17:31  ik ur not supposed to analyse 1-day stocks but cubes stock has fallen 6.57% (lowest i saw was 8%) as of right now while other companies only have a difference of 1-2%
3089 2018-09-13 08:17:21 Got scared after seeing their stocks dropping 
3090 2018-09-13 08:16:59 Cube is just saving their stocks. Grabe kasi ang ibinagsak nung nag-announce sila na tinanggal sina Hyuna at EDawn.
3091 2018-09-13 08:16:58 i hope stocks go down even mORE, LIKE THIS IS GONNA HELP THEIR STIUTatiON??
3092 2018-09-13 08:16:55 cube probably trying to salvage their stocks
3093 2018-09-13 08:16:47 Cube’s stocks dropped 6.57% (last time I checked) because of this situation. This doesn’t just affect Hyuna and Edawn’s careers, it affects everyone under their label. Including Edawns own group, who just had a comeback...
3094 2018-09-13 08:16:46 Cube is so messed up. Suddenly its "NOT CONFIRMED" when the stocks went down lmfao. Honestly, queen HyunA deserves better like leave that company girl you got more opportunities out there! Bring your baby Edawn too of course, we love a power couple an entertainment can't handle.
3095 2018-09-13 08:16:26 Not to be an insensitive troll or something pero ang tirik ng araw. Yung closing kagabi nag akyat sa stockroom ng mga stocks. Opening duty ako, pumasok akong  pharma tas pag lagpas 6:30am nag a-assemble ako ng tatlong POS hayop.
3096 2018-09-13 08:16:26 Cube game over sia stocks drop then change statement lmfao
3097 2018-09-13 08:16:23 LMAO You just can't kick out your cash cow out of the company and expect your stocks not to run downhill. 
3098 2018-09-13 08:16:23 It's seems cube is shaking because the stocks is going down lol
3099 2018-09-13 08:16:14 Cube saw how Hyuna and EDawn trended on worldwide twt and how their stocks hit an all-time low so this is like their immediate countermeasure to save themselves but nevertheless they still cancelled for showing how they are willing to drop their artists just like that 
3100 2018-09-13 08:16:04 Hahahahahahah their stocks fell  and they r changing it 
3101 2018-09-13 08:16:00 cube: hyuna and edawn are removed from our company for trust issues
stocks: immediately plummet
cube: wait fuck go back
3102 2018-09-13 08:15:59 cube: hyundawn are now dismissed from the company as we cannot continue working w them cuz they broke our trust but thanks for yall support these past years anyway

also cube: aite we were just playin pls stop selling our stocks we need monies to pay the bills
3103 2018-09-13 08:15:56 Hahahahahahaha ang funny nun ah hahahahaha takot sila ih bagsak stocks nila 
3104 2018-09-13 08:15:54 Plan for fisheries exploiting demersal stocks in the western mediterranean: opinion by @AdinaValean to @EP_Fisheries adopted with 34 votes in favour, 2 against and 5 abstentions. PECH vote 21/11.
3105 2018-09-13 08:15:52 After this. You think Hyuna & Edawn will accept this treatment? They basically threw them out of the bus without talking to them & then now bec your stocks are dropping u want to take your decision back? What kind of mangement is this!!!?!?!?!?
3106 2018-09-13 08:15:34 cube: youre out
cube, later, holding their burning stocks: uhhHhh about that ha-ha. april fools?
3107 2018-09-13 08:15:30 cube got fucking scared seeing their stocks go down lmaooo
3108 2018-09-13 08:15:24 Hyuna is their biggest moneymaker. They did the same to 4minute. Their stocks dropped after the news and they're changing stance now saying they're not sure they'll kick them out after they release that statement on their own. Cube is just really shitty. No excuses.
3109 2018-09-13 08:15:19 everyones saying that cube is reconsidering because their stocks dropped but like  it’s more likely that theyre doing this as a reaction to cube/pentagon/hyuna/edawn trending with hundreds of thousands of tweets even at that
3110 2018-09-13 08:15:12 CUBE got scared because this issue has been trending worldwide. And the fact that their stocks is plummeting to the ground.
3111 2018-09-13 08:15:04 Cube took it back LMAO they must have seen their stocks go down after the kick out announcement
3112 2018-09-13 08:14:56 Of course it does. Honestly they're a bunch of cowards. They saw their stocks dropping. Hyuna alone is worth $10 million according to the net.
3113 2018-09-13 08:14:48 Cube: let's kick that mothafukas, show em who's the boss
*stocks drop, cube is canceled*
Cube: u-uh....it's not final! It's still in discussion!!
3114 2018-09-13 08:14:48 cube saw their stocks and said sike LMAO this doesn’t change anything  #CubeIsCancelledParty #CubeIsOverParty
3115 2018-09-13 08:14:44 NAN TUNGOD GA NAOG ANG STOCKS? BOBO
3116 2018-09-13 08:14:38 DIJERON QUE NO CONFIABAN EN ELLOS Y QUE ESTABAN YA FUERA DE CUBE Y AHORITA QUE VEN QUE ESTÁN BAJANDO LOS STOCKS SE ARREPINTIERON LMAO CUBE IS PUSSY

3118 2018-09-13 08:14:36 They saw the drop in stocks. These bitches.
3119 2018-09-13 08:14:35 YELLING CUBE BACKTRACKED WHEN THEY SAW THEIR STOCKS DROP HARDER THAN AN OLYMPIC DIVER
3120 2018-09-13 08:14:30 I can imagine Cube's stocks fluctuating like crazy from people who are shorting
3121 2018-09-13 08:14:27 FLIPO, Hyuna literalmente les salvó de la bancarrota y ahora la echan. E´Dawn es un gran artista y súper querido en Pentagon. Esta es la peor decisión que podían haber tomado. Ya los stocks de CUBE están bajando muchísimo. Es lo que se merecen. Querer a alguien no es un delito.
3122 2018-09-13 08:14:22 si sono accorti degli stocks
3123 2018-09-13 08:14:21 Saw their stocks going down so must’ve gotten scared 
3124 2018-09-13 08:14:10 After they saw their stocks dropping like hell, they're now pulling back and telling them Hyuna and E'Dawn are not kicked out. Gahhh
3125 2018-09-13 08:14:07 OMG CUBE WTF first they come up with a statement that theyre kicked out and stocks head rock bottom and suddenly oH iTs OnLy a DiScUsSiOn iTs NoT cOnFiRmEd yEt
3126 2018-09-13 08:14:06 Their stocks are plummeting as we speak.
3127 2018-09-13 08:14:06 cube: hyuna and edawn ur out
*stocks dropped in an instant*
cube: oops wait how bout we discuss it first
3128 2018-09-13 08:13:52 cube is currently doing an urgent meeting w/ hyuna and e dawn hmm pentagon probs threatened to leave the company but honestly this situation is already so messed up their stocks r dropping and ruined their reputation sorry but cube is canceled
3129 2018-09-13 08:13:44 hyuna literally contributed most to stocks.. cube you tryna commit sewercide right..
3130 2018-09-13 08:13:43 did cube take a step back bcs of their stocks dropping or the backlash from everybody...?
3131 2018-09-13 08:13:41 yeah their stocks plummeted and now suddenly they're just "in discussion" and they aren't kicked out yet sure ok cube
3132 2018-09-13 08:13:38 Il n’est plus commercialisé, du moins jusqu’a épuisement des stocks
3133 2018-09-13 08:13:34 cube: we're kicking hyuna and hyojong out of the company
stocks: go down 
cube: we said HYPOTHETICALLY......in THEORY......WHAT IF we were kicking them out of the company.......this is just A SCENARIO we're CONSIDERING in our MINDS.............
3134 2018-09-13 08:13:28 cube: hyuna and e-dawn are officially removed from the company
*cube stocks drop 8% in 4~ hours*
cube: lmao we were just playing
3135 2018-09-13 08:13:27 EYE HAVE TO LAUGH, THEY THEIR STOCKS DROP AND DID A SIKE
3136 2018-09-13 08:13:26 However, it was a stupid Trade to buy the same stocks at their peak just before the Dotcom crash. I accept your Belief but you cannot ignore market entry and market exit opportunities. You got in very early. Others were not so lucky.
3137 2018-09-13 08:13:23 AND AFTER THEIR STOCKS DROP CUBE SAID "Oh no actually we are still DISCUSSING" mother fucking dumbaASS
3138 2018-09-13 08:13:18 cube now backtracking since their stocks are free falling 
3139 2018-09-13 08:13:17 Cube saw their stocks drop and were like shit
3140 2018-09-13 08:13:05 lmao suddenly cube decided not to kick hyuna and edawn out of their company after they saw that their stocks suddenly drop lmao
3141 2018-09-13 08:13:02 It definitely has to do with the stocks and backlash. Like, they were so ready to kick them out cause they couldn't be trusted, but now they're willing to reincorporate them??? Do they think we are stupid?
3142 2018-09-13 08:13:00 LOL Cube shifting to a considerate tone after stocks crumbled down LOL
3143 2018-09-13 08:12:58 CUBE is such a joke.... your words can take back so easily??? More like you are scared of the backlash and the fact your stocks are dropping like grapes
3144 2018-09-13 08:12:57 I’m LAUGHING did they see their stocks drop harder than my grades
3145 2018-09-13 08:12:49 Lol at cube finally realizing that they are digging their own grave. Stocks are not goinf anywhere but down. Serves u right.
3146 2018-09-13 08:12:49 if it wasnt confirmed theyre gg to be kicked out then yall shouldnt have released shit in the first place.....hyuna and edawn must hv been hella confused when they found out thru social media...and now ur stocks drop alot and yall sayin it aint cfm.....
3147 2018-09-13 08:12:35 cube really saw the stocks plummet and were like uuuuuhhhh so, new plan,
3148 2018-09-13 08:12:16 their stocks slumping very rapidly they decided to take back their stance to “hold more discussions”. Fuck them
3149 2018-09-13 08:12:12 Can someone do a livestream of cube stocks falling
3150 2018-09-13 08:12:09 they saw their stocks dropping faster than hyuna in the roll deep choreography and realized they fucked up

3156 2018-09-13 08:11:48 This company is a mess they took one look st their stocks after announcing the news and THATS when they realised they messed up
3157 2018-09-13 08:11:46 cube’s stocks dropped by like 100 won since the news dropped that’s 9 cents ...
3158 2018-09-13 08:11:41 Apparently cube just confirmed they are not kicked out of cube They’re “discussing” god knows what Probably because they saw how much their stocks dropped Hyuna and Edwan deserved better then this shitty treatment
3159 2018-09-13 08:11:36 cube: we are removing hyuna and edawn as we have deemed them as untrustworthy
cube, seeing stocks fall: Sike! maybe not! :)
3160 2018-09-13 08:11:35 so now cube are saying they aren’t kicked out LMAO they must’ve checked their stocks
3161 2018-09-13 08:11:34 The saw their stocks rapidly going downhill so they had to take several seats  still complete and utter bs btw

3164 2018-09-13 08:11:32 How would thier stocks drop if they where kicked out of the company, I dont get.

I really dont get it I am serious
3165 2018-09-13 08:11:26 cube officials throwing a temper tantrum: WE'RE KICKING EVERYONE OUT INSTEAD OF DEALING WITH THIS INTERNALLY BECAUSE THAT'S THE KIND OF COMPANY WE ARE!!!
cube officials when their stocks start dropping that very second: can't believe you all fell for it 
3166 2018-09-13 08:11:23 Hyuna made Cube what they are today it's like they kicked out their own CEO so of course their stocks would go shit in just hours and the bastards panicked and went like SIKE it was a prank fuck Cube honestly

Charot
3170 2018-09-13 08:11:11 Sto immaginando i dirigenti della Cube stile Zio Paperone che piangono sui grafici degli stocks in declino e corrono aggrappandosi alle caviglie di Hyuna per non farla andare via, quando lei ha già preso la sua Gucci ed è pronta a slayare per conto suo.
#CubeIsOverParty
3171 2018-09-13 08:10:59 it is not about the stocks bc they already saw this happen before, but now hyuna probably said something or take legal actions and they're discussing like the adults they are
3172 2018-09-13 08:10:59 cube: bye y'alls
cube stocks: bye cube
cube: wait i didn't mean it come back

 @cubeunited
3178 2018-09-13 08:10:27 So cube changed their stance on kicking out hyuna and edawn prolly after seeing their stocks plummet. I want to laugh, they really dug their own grave
3179 2018-09-13 08:10:22 cube saw their stocks plummet so they were like PAUSE .  HOLD UP
3180 2018-09-13 08:10:14 That backtrack lmao their stocks are definitely dropping
3181 2018-09-13 08:10:09 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
3182 2018-09-13 08:10:07 pffft cube stocks are plummeting n I'm going to work now,, i wanna know what happens next
3183 2018-09-13 08:10:05 A consistent buy and hold methodology has worked for many people in other investments like #stocks and #realestate, I reckon the same method works for #cryptocurrency, too.
3184 2018-09-13 08:09:49 When you take a look at your stocks
3185 2018-09-13 08:09:44 LMAO Cube is a joke. Taking back your artists after announcing they've been kicked out because your stocks be going down down down.
3186 2018-09-13 08:09:43 Are they panicking bc their stocks went down lol
3187 2018-09-13 08:09:33 I hope Hyuna and Edawn decide to quit Cube to teach them a lesson bc they deserve it. I predict the stocks droppin even more. This thing with idols not being able to date without hiding it is ridiculous. It needs to change
3188 2018-09-13 08:09:32 cube, seeing their stocks fall like jimin on stage: ᵒʰ ˢʰᶦᵗ ᵒʰ ˢʰᶦᵗ ᴴᴼᴸᴰ ᵀᴴᴱ ᶠᵁᶜᴷ ᵁᴾ
3189 2018-09-13 08:09:24 me and joss were literally eating noodles when she was like LOOL CUBE'S STOCKS
3190 2018-09-13 08:09:21 @cubeunited due to high drop in stocks? 
3191 2018-09-13 08:09:17 I'm what they r doing. Ya cuz of their stocks but this is also a way of scaring the others in the company "Go against us and this is your end"
3192 2018-09-13 08:09:16 currently looking at cube's stocks dropping ahh this feels like watching problematic youtubers losing subscribers it's what they deserve
3193 2018-09-13 08:09:07 lmao i honestly think they weren’t expecting their stocks to fall so badly
3194 2018-09-13 08:09:07 so did cube saw their stocks dropping and decided to hol up and finally realised how dumb they are
3195 2018-09-13 08:09:03 Cube: “we are kicking hyuna and hyojong out of our company we have lost trust”
*cube’s stocks drop terribly*
Cube: “so... we were just kidding they aren’t kicked out we love playing jokes it was just a joke we would never kick them out”
3196 2018-09-13 08:08:56 The stocks plummeting probably woke them up. Tho this was a diq move, I hope for the best for Hyuna and Edawn. Such  company can't be trusted.
3197 2018-09-13 08:08:55 When they saw their stocks plummeting 
3198 2018-09-13 08:08:49 lmao suddenly cube decided not to kick hyuna and edawn after they see their stocks drop lmao what a joke
3199 2018-09-13 08:08:46 lmao so i guess cube saw their stocks plummeting and finally remembered how important hyuna is to the company
3200 2018-09-13 08:08:43 HAHHAA cube issa joke it took the stocks price to drop for them to realize they made a HUGE mistake
3201 2018-09-13 08:08:38 I love seeing their stocks dropping
3202 2018-09-13 08:08:37 if after this they still kick them out i hope their stocks drop until they go thru the ceiling of satan's bedroom in hell
3203 2018-09-13 08:08:35 Nakita sa cube ng pag drop sa ilang stocks. HAHAHAH SO WAIT SA DAW. NIMAL
3204 2018-09-13 08:08:35 Ah April April guys it was just a joke haha
* sweating after seeing the stocks dropping dramatically*
3205 2018-09-13 08:08:22 werla sila kay nagbaba maayo ilang stocks. murag mga tala hahahaha
3206 2018-09-13 08:08:21 Wth is cube doing 
they are probably thinking again because their stocks dropped a lot after that news
3207 2018-09-13 08:08:19 Yeah basically their stocks for tanking when cube f***** up and decided to kick these two out. And fans and stock holders were like. hell no. . Cuz it sure wasn't the haters that caused it. Those people were never real fans anyway
3208 2018-09-13 08:08:18 also to the company's stocks dropping
3209 2018-09-13 08:08:16 they saw their stocks and were like oops maybe we shouldnt have done that
3210 2018-09-13 08:08:04 I was just reading this and damn. Look at the stocks go down. Stupid move tbh
3211 2018-09-13 08:08:00 What? Is this a game? They saw their stocks go down...and now they want to reconsider.. Just JUST STOP CUBE
3212 2018-09-13 08:07:59 non cambierà nulla e lo sappiamo la cube vuole solo pararsi il culo ora che sono crollati tutti gli stocks
3213 2018-09-13 08:07:49 stocks be dropping, cube is shaking
3214 2018-09-13 08:07:47 they only did this cos they saw their stocks dropping lmao
3215 2018-09-13 08:07:44 Backed up real quick after looking at their stocks dropping
3216 2018-09-13 08:07:41 Honesty no one deserves this much .Apparently they discovered the news that they were getting dropped through the news and now that Cube's stocks dropped they are rethinking their choice.I hope they'll get picked up by another company tbh
3217 2018-09-13 08:07:41 Lol cube is cancelled they’re scared down to their bones seeing their stocks dropping like grapes haHAAhahhaAahahHAHA LOSERS
3218 2018-09-13 08:07:40 LMAO they got freaked out about their stocks plummeting.
3219 2018-09-13 08:07:30 They are scared their stocks will decrease even further those cowards 
3220 2018-09-13 08:07:22 So in conclusion

*hyuna & edawn announced they r dating w/o telling cube*

cube:we cant trust em anymore, lets kick em out from here

*announced it thru articles w/o telling the artists they r fired, stocks began to drop*

cube:hold on nothing is confirm we r still in discusison
3221 2018-09-13 08:07:18 For a company that is in the industry over a decade, they've shown major unprofessionalism. Besides the stocks declining, you've also drag your other innocent artists and the same time ruining your image you've build for so many years. It's a shame
3222 2018-09-13 08:07:00 Cube is backtracking their decision now that their stocks have hit the floor lmfao. It’s what they deserve
3223 2018-09-13 08:06:55 Cube: we're kicking Hyuna and E'Dawn out
*5mins after
Hyuna and E'Dawn: ...
stocks: plummet down
people: angry
investors: out of there
Cube: nvm that was an oopsie uwu we didn't mean it

Hyuna and E'Dawn: ...
3224 2018-09-13 08:06:38 I’m laughing at Cube’s stocks
3225 2018-09-13 08:06:34 I’m glad edawn and hyuna have a second chance tho. Lowkey feel like they should leave as a big fu to cube so their stocks can go down more At least now it’s negotiable. Maybe edawn Can go back to his group and they can demand not to be broken up and instead supported by the comp.
3226 2018-09-13 08:06:27 Cube: *looks at their stocks*
Cube: *sweats*
Cube:  BAZINGA!
3227 2018-09-13 08:06:21 Basically

Cube: "we kicked hyuna and edawn."

*seeing their stocks drop*

Cube: "WAIT--"
3228 2018-09-13 08:06:16 They saw their stocks plummet and now they're trying to take it back. But that's not how this game works. 
3229 2018-09-13 08:06:14 cube: lets go of hyuna and  edawn
cubes' stocks: drop
cube: cant yall take a JOKE we were JOKING we are NOT letting go of two of our BEST artists
3230 2018-09-13 08:06:03 oh wow how money face? STOCKS DROPPING SO THEY BE LIKE : happy sept fools ! we're just joking !
3231 2018-09-13 08:05:59 All RT had to do to achieve all of Russia’s war information objectives was tell the truth, often backed with satellite imagery: US bombing open fields instead of ISIS; ISIS selling oil via Turkey; Israel providing medical treatment for al Qaeda; the vast stocks of US arms...
3232 2018-09-13 08:05:59 Funny how following Cube's stocks dropped massively they suddenly say that it's not confirmed that HyunA and E'Dawn are kicked out of the company 
3233 2018-09-13 08:05:59 Bumagsak kasi lalo stocks nila kaya kkkkkkkk

The two of them should just fire Cube management and take over hahahahaha
3234 2018-09-13 08:05:58 Someone saw their stocks
3235 2018-09-13 08:05:49 they saw their stocks drop and went OH SHIT BACK PEDDLE
3236 2018-09-13 08:05:40 I don't understand why fans are so happy that cube's stock is dropping when that shit ain't new, whenever there's someone leaving or some shit kpop companies always experiences drops afterwards and then the stocks will be back to normal in just a few days lol 
3237 2018-09-13 08:05:36 And now after the stocks fall down, they say they will discuss it first. Shame on you, cube. Shame on you.
3238 2018-09-13 08:05:35 cube saw their stocks drop and are now reconsidering can hyuna and edawn please leave voluntarily cube is shit
3239 2018-09-13 08:05:35 yes I was upset abt hyuna being kicked out but now that cube is essentially redacting bc their stocks plummeted, I hope hyuna realizes this company gives zero fcks abt her and leaves on her own. what shitty company makes a statement as big as kicking out an artist & then says nvm
3240 2018-09-13 08:05:10 they’re backtracking after seeing their stocks drop 
3241 2018-09-13 08:04:54 The stocks went down a lot
3242 2018-09-13 08:04:53 :00 so aft seeing their stocks go down cube decided to *ahem* hold more *cough* discussions *cough* wow :")
3243 2018-09-13 08:04:41 cube saw their stocks drop and said sike lol whst a fucking mess do they even know what theyre doing god im so angry
3244 2018-09-13 08:04:33 Cube, with this extreme decision, is just taking things backwards. I hope cube stocks never recover and keep dropping down, because that’s a better message to dumb agencies such as themselves.
3245 2018-09-13 08:04:29 Oh Hyuna and Hyojong please get out off that hell hole please. They saw how their stocks went down now they're changing their statement.
3246 2018-09-13 08:04:26 Lolol cube retracting their statement and saying ‘they are thinking about it’, we all know you saw your stocks skyrocketing down and probs want to bring them back to save your goddamn shit of a company
3247 2018-09-13 08:04:10 saw them stocks dropping and said sike just kidding we didn’t kick out edawn and hyuna we were just messing around
3248 2018-09-13 08:04:03 So y’all see your stocks dropping and decide it was  all a joke...why release the statement in the first place is you were still “in discussions”. What a sorry excuse of a company
3249 2018-09-13 08:04:00 Conspiracy theory

Cube let this news spread simply to see what public reaction and effect on stocks was gonna be

Only to then decide on their official release (confirm or deny) after having made sure they made a good decision for business

Gross and inhumane
But it feels true
3250 2018-09-13 08:03:58 cube: bye hyundawn
cube stocks: 
hyuna:
netizens: 
the whole industry:
jo jinho with a knife repeating I could have been in EXO. in a very quiet voice: 
cube: just kidding!
3251 2018-09-13 08:03:48 apparently cube has changed their stance about hyojong and hyuna and not kicking them out ksjsjs they saw their stocks drop
3252 2018-09-13 08:03:46 How are Cube's stocks doing?
3253 2018-09-13 08:03:44 This is what happened when you see your stocks falling like a rocket 
3254 2018-09-13 08:03:28 oh did cube see their stocks plummet?
3255 2018-09-13 08:03:23 Oh please. It's so obvious that they're just trying to do this to save their stocks from plummeting even further. #CubeIsOverParty
3256 2018-09-13 08:03:18 did Cube just realize what they did, watch their stocks plummet, investors pull out and people riot and were like, "nvm, we did an oopsie, they might not even be kicked out yet uwu"
cube knows they're fucked if they lose Hyuna and E'Dawn now for sure, keep speaking out
3257 2018-09-13 08:03:11 They saw the stocks plummeting
3258 2018-09-13 08:02:58 cube watched their stocks drop and backtracked their bullshit fucking quickly
3259 2018-09-13 08:02:45 their stocks dropped so they went nevermind
3260 2018-09-13 08:02:35 cube: we kicked hyuna and hyojong out
*stocks fall down abruptly*
cube: issa joookeeee it was a social experiment!!!!!
3261 2018-09-13 08:02:35 Parianas @_machiparu_ Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
3262 2018-09-13 08:02:33 apparently cubes stocks dropped by half a billion? if this is true ima have a party lmao suck it
3263 2018-09-13 08:02:31 It’s probably just bc their stocks were dropping so fast
3264 2018-09-13 08:02:23 they were like hold up emergency our stocks are falling like crazy
3265 2018-09-13 08:02:19 oh so now they saw what's happening with their stocks and saw hyuna and hyojong statement so suddenly its being discussed?

3269 2018-09-13 08:01:48 What if it is just to get the attention of everyone? and to scare HyunA from being “cocky”? 

But damn box got scared too when their stocks fluctuated.

3276 2018-09-13 08:01:16 Hah...result of falling stocks.. 
Their ass got kicked pretty fast. 
Wishing hyuna and E'dawn the very best
3277 2018-09-13 08:01:15 Betrayed? Did you even think about the backlash after they admitted it? Bad press for the company, stocks dropped, other groups like clc and other pentagon members were dragged to the mix bcos kfans don't trust them to maintain a sibling relationship anymore.
3278 2018-09-13 08:01:06 they took back their word because their stocks dropped so much  what a great company huh
3279 2018-09-13 08:01:03 LMAO cube took that shit back real fuckin quick once those stocks dropped
3280 2018-09-13 08:01:02 Cowards. They saw their stocks falling and realized they’re nothing without Hyuna. Pathetic.
3281 2018-09-13 08:01:00 did they get the message after their stocks plummeted or what?
3282 2018-09-13 08:00:54 lmfao they saw their stocks plummet
3283 2018-09-13 08:00:52 Cube after seeing their stocks drop. What a joke of a company
3284 2018-09-13 08:00:26 The platform will initially operate in a centralized fashion, supporting traditional cryptocurrencies & tokens, in addition to an initial release of DACTs, wrapping popular financial instruments such as the SP500, tech stocks and commodities #Virtuse #DACTs #Cryptocurrency #Token
3285 2018-09-13 07:59:36 "LOVE HOW THEY TRY TO SAVE THEIR ASSES AFTER THEY SAW HOW THE STOCKS HAVE FALLEN." 

literally what i'm trying to say. haha hoho @cubeunited! 
3286 2018-09-13 07:58:59 are they about to take them back kasi stocks are dropping lmao 
3287 2018-09-13 07:58:32 Cube probably thought they would be fine dropping them and then the shareholders saw the plummeting stocks and got PISSED
3288 2018-09-13 07:58:18 their stocks are dropping so fast rn and they seriously deserve it
3289 2018-09-13 07:57:19 You are not alone. Having hit a new high early on I have been well under water for most of the year. The high yield financial and property stocks that I hold for income are not in fashion. Hoping for a decent bounce once life continues after Brexit, but won't hold my breath.
3290 2018-09-13 07:57:13 Cube: Hey everyone, we're letting go of these 2 without even telling them.
*stocks drop massively*
 Cube: It's just a jooookeeee bruuuuuh
3291 2018-09-13 07:56:32 Following the news about Hyuna & E'Dawn leaving, the company stocks of Cube Ent. has been dropped. Not surprised anymore since Hyuna is the moneymaker in Cube. Good luck Cube ent.
3292 2018-09-13 07:56:28 CUBE IS DUMB AS HELL?? Hyuna fucking saved them from going bankrupt and E'Dawn's voice is so fucking unique they cannot replace him in pentagon?? 

Their stocks are pluimmeting and honestly, serves them
3293 2018-09-13 07:56:25 #CubeIsOverParty someone please do a livestream of cube stocks falling down
3294 2018-09-13 07:56:04 12:52 AM maybe one can begin counting sheep now. Read about whiskey, money, metal, computers, video games, housing, stocks, crypto....who knows what else. Mind is fried and feel like the internet is conquered for the night.
3295 2018-09-13 07:55:57 Cube: You're out
*Stocks drop drastically*
Cube: We didn't mean what we said holdup
3296 2018-09-13 07:55:39 Imagine being this childish and stupid to remove your artist without informing them
I'm just glad cube didn't try to sue Hyuna and E'Dawn for "breaking the rules of contract", that would be even dumber
Cube's stocks have dropped and idk if I'm happy or not cause-
3297 2018-09-13 07:55:36 have you seen their stocks??? they’re going  down streaks !!!
3298 2018-09-13 07:55:26 Cube deserves the plummeting of stocks. F*uck cube. I hope they see this hashtag and feel guilty.  #CubeIsOverParty
3299 2018-09-13 07:54:25 well Cube Ent stocks just did a suicide jump. the line in the stock market is practically a vertical line down after 12pm
3300 2018-09-13 07:54:00 Look at the stocks falling lmao
3301 2018-09-13 07:53:03 Ok Cube nice try of saving your stocks' ass it's still going down though
3302 2018-09-13 07:52:45 Novichok stocks have run out, so the Russians have become more inventive.
3303 2018-09-13 07:52:25 R.I.P cube now all their stocks will fall and they  will have no money because of this horrible mistake #cubeiscancelledparty
3304 2018-09-13 07:52:24 I CANT BREATHE WHAT IF CUBE REALLY WERE WATCHING THE HATE COMMENTS COME IN AND THEIR STOCKS DROPPING IN REAL TIME AND WERE LIKE UHHHH QUICK SOMEONE TELL A NEWS OUTLET IT’S ONLY IN DISCUSSION
3305 2018-09-13 07:51:50 so they saw their stocks and chickened out
3306 2018-09-13 07:50:50 hey guys if yall ever wanted to try bungee jumping or skydiving, i know the perfect place! cube stocks 
3307 2018-09-13 07:50:45 reads to me like c*be scrambling to cover their asses after their stocks took a nosedive :\
3308 2018-09-13 07:48:54 i heard their stocks are dropping. and i also hate the delulu, possesive fans who are hating on them and probably are the reason why cube did what they did smh
3309 2018-09-13 07:48:49 It is. But hey, as soon as they announced it, apparently their stocks went down like the Titanic
3310 2018-09-13 07:48:37 so my exams are in a week but at least i can take comfort in the fact that my grades can't drop as badly as cube's stocks did! 
3311 2018-09-13 07:47:33 Yes, lots of that goes on. I use things that like if I want a general opinion or to clarify something I've looked up that isn't always clear cut.

Reminds me I was going to do a Telegram group for local pharmacists in GP, maybe for CP too so we can get an idea of out of stocks?
3312 2018-09-13 07:47:24 Their stocks dropped for real bro. I like it lol
3313 2018-09-13 07:47:17 right......i hope they never recover all those stocks they lost LMAO
3314 2018-09-13 07:47:14 Cube Entertainment's stocks going down is what they deserve. Also I'm proud of everyone for hitting the company where it hurts. Their wallet is the only thing they care about
3315 2018-09-13 07:47:05 i am watching cube's stocks going down with all amusement
3316 2018-09-13 07:47:02 imma just watch cube's stocks go downhill. no offense but hyuna's been carrying them FOR YEARS and kicking her out is like yg removing gd.
3317 2018-09-13 07:46:28 i never knew cube’s stocks can drop harder than my grades and self esteem
3318 2018-09-13 07:46:25 watching cube’s stocks go down 
3319 2018-09-13 07:45:54 Cube: WE ARE KICKING HYUNA AND EDAWN OUT!!!!!
*their stocks dropped and kpop stans are mad*
Cube: I never said that we will kick them out! Hyuna and Edawn are my friends!

#CubeIsOverParty
3320 2018-09-13 07:45:43 cube really panicking bc their stocks dropped faster than my grades LMAOOO
3321 2018-09-13 07:45:31 I hope cube is regretting their decision to appease kfans by kicking out two of their biggest artists when they see how low their stocks are dropping since that's the only thing they care about.
3322 2018-09-13 07:44:51 Nah, they have brass deflectors and hbar. But rear sight is A1 style it looks like. Stocks are A2 as well, thicker butt plate. Who knows what the guts are.
3323 2018-09-13 07:44:35 2.5bn shares have changed hands today worth $6.2bn. 567 stocks are up, 578 down & 392 are flat #ausbiz
3324 2018-09-13 07:44:33 So what is it Cube are you saying it's under talks now because your stocks suddenly plummeted
3325 2018-09-13 07:44:21 NRA used to be a respected association. It is now run by lobbyists and funders. It's unfortunate. I owned two rifles when I was a kid. I couldn't touch them without supervision and they were locked away. Now, bumper stocks and high powered weapons are now the new rifles.
3326 2018-09-13 07:44:19 the status of cube entertainment stocks in one word:

3331 2018-09-13 07:43:05 Cube's stocks are dropping quicker than my grades.
3332 2018-09-13 07:42:55 Maybe cube stocks going down for kicking out 2 stars!! Cube dumb af
3333 2018-09-13 07:42:28 My solution to Cube's problem. Debunk the rumor of E'dawn and Hyuna being kicked out, announce E'Dawn rejoining Pentagon, announce Hyuna comeback, announce CLC comeback, do it all tomorrow. Stocks will shoot through the roof. I guarantee that.
3334 2018-09-13 07:42:25 Love how they try to save their asses after they saw how the stocks have fallen
3335 2018-09-13 07:42:20 We should be talking about management and conservation of stocks.

Dredging doesn't look like a good idea.
3336 2018-09-13 07:41:32 It was the fans that made a big deal out of it and the dumbass company themselves. I mean it’s fine they’re dropping in stocks. They’ll soon be bankrupt
3337 2018-09-13 07:40:40 Now that Cubes' stocks dropped for almost 10% in the market, lets expect a "No-Rest and  More Hectic" schedules for G-IDLE and BTOB.
3338 2018-09-13 07:40:12 Put your hand up if your stocks go down religiously every fucking day
3339 2018-09-13 07:40:07 Cube is still fucking canceled if they take this back. They don't care about their artists and they would only be taking this back to save their own asses and their stocks
3340 2018-09-13 07:40:07 cube, watching their stocks tank following their press release: .....we didn't think this through

3353 2018-09-13 07:35:17 cube doing all of this bc their reputation took a hit from the dating news causing investors to pull out as if their pettiness & unprofessionalism in the current situation isn’t making their stocks drop even further..
3354 2018-09-13 07:34:24 Also, they are a bunch of laughing stocks to the world! I wouldn't do that to my country.
3355 2018-09-13 07:33:51 apparently their stocks are going down
3356 2018-09-13 07:31:58 While she's not the main moneymaker, stocks did go down with that news so yeah they'd be scared.
3357 2018-09-13 07:31:10 Hi, Assets Under Management. Have a portfolio worth of Php 1M either in stocks, cash, or mutual funds. Thank you.
3358 2018-09-13 07:31:09 As expected Lmao. Their stocks are dropping like shxt. This is exactly what cube entertainment desreve. For not just taking away their passion, but also ruining their future as artists.
3359 2018-09-13 07:30:42 @/cubeunited IM GLAD YOUR STOCKS ARE FALLING !!
3360 2018-09-13 07:30:39 All this saw little movement in stocks globally (but even the HSI bounced) but took the USD a little lower on an improvement of risk sentiment.

3364 2018-09-13 07:29:31 Cube need to grow a backbone.  I hope they can be made to regret their decision! They've just reinforced toxic fan culture.  SM didn't remove Baekhyun or Kai for supposedly dating other SM artists and they lost millions at the time.  Stocks recover.  Hope Cube doesn't!

3370 2018-09-13 07:28:18 Matters took a turn for the worse when Simon’s time machine malfunctioned, stranding  him in 1381. The peasants were busy revolting and didn’t have time for the teleporter. Mistaking him for a #simpleton, they threw him in the stocks for speaking into the shiny onyx slab.

3421 2018-09-13 07:07:59 So is the FED! Though they hold BILLIONS in junk Bonds also "left over" from the Great Recession!

3429 2018-09-13 07:04:38 Sad to say but that's how companies like CUBE treat their artists. Trust is a big issue in Korea.  Stakeholders were not happy with the datin news. cube's stocks was on the rise before . But then went down when the dating news came out T T.

3434 2018-09-13 07:03:00 Why does everyone act like he's got all that $ lying around his home?  Family size.  Monthly $ paid on bills.  So many factors beyond WHO they work for.

3435 2018-09-13 07:02:52 Just imagine this scenario with me after Cube kicked Hyuna and E'dwan out today and there stocks hit rock bottom one of the major companies sign'em in and baam they skyrocket 
That'll teach cube not to treat their legends that way
3436 2018-09-13 07:02:42 Omg this is such an ugly move Cube. And you talk about trust? How about having some consideration for your artists? HyunA hasnt been making your stocks go up for 11 years for nothing. #CubeIsOverParty #현아
3437 2018-09-13 07:02:29 I hate them, but at least im getting enjoyment of watching their stocks drop

3448 2018-09-13 06:57:03 i can’t speak for everyone but it’s more of the fact that they want to cancel a company full of artists who honestly weren’t even mildly involved w hyuna and edawn’s love life? stocks falling isn’t smth to joke about, that’s a lot of groups whose dreams and careers are at stake
3449 2018-09-13 06:56:05 imagine kicking out two artist who literally MADE you LMAOOO YOUR STOCKS FINNA DROP  #CubeisCanceled

3451 2018-09-13 06:55:48 better have your stocks fall at first than house an artist you can't control in the long run I guess 

they're products to them
3452 2018-09-13 06:55:47 made the biggest mistake of their life and their stocks are dropping by 7% i think

3458 2018-09-13 06:51:06 This is just ridiculous...well,CUBE, have fun seeing your stocks drop    ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
3459 2018-09-13 06:51:04 No, I was thinking of reference photos and illustrations of New Zealand fish, the kinds of images that would be used in factsheets about New Zealand fish stocks (or in Wikipedia!)
3460 2018-09-13 06:50:27 bruh i ain't even going here but that one picture of that company's stocks PLUMMETING still has me cackling
3461 2018-09-13 06:49:38 ok although we're hoping cubes stocks falling will make them realise, im worried about the other idols on their label. they don't deserve to be punished for what cube did. its so hard to find a way to get justice without harming other idols that are innocent
3462 2018-09-13 06:47:28 Buhari is a failure. You should not support that. We still share the same country, you can't want to reelect a failure and I won't engage you. Your decision will affect me. Price of stocks fell the day Buhari's reelection bid was announced, FDIs won't come, I/We deserve BETTER.

3464 2018-09-13 06:47:14 Fcking true. Their stocks are going fown already
3465 2018-09-13 06:47:13 This is my personal take on what I think happened in Cube Ent. I think Cube considers keeping E'Dawn in Pentagon was poisonous for the group and the stocks and the fans' reaction confirmed that. If they were kicking him out, HyunA was also to blame. This is not about trust but 
3466 2018-09-13 06:47:07 Cube's stocks plummeted right after the news too. Pentagon and Edawn are both on the line and I'm so worried :c
3467 2018-09-13 06:46:23 *looking at company stocks* I'm praying all the idols and trainees are able to bounce 'cause at this rate their incomes are going to be affected
3468 2018-09-13 06:46:01 Cubes stocks are really plummeting I love justice
3469 2018-09-13 06:45:35 Looking to combine some value with momentum.. 

Anyone got any cheap hated stocks in an uptrend?
3470 2018-09-13 06:45:35 Pretty much tanked Fitbit stocks.

3472 2018-09-13 06:43:36 Alright square entertainment since y’all doing what y’all want, I want y’all to give edawn and hyuna all your money, all your stocks and let them run the show
3473 2018-09-13 06:43:32 cube's stocks drastically dropped after the announcement how is that good news i know some are thinking it serves them right but considering that other artists are still in there how could u be happy about this
3474 2018-09-13 06:43:28 mr chang: don’t check your stocks everyday it will stress you out

me: *checking stocks everyday* did you hear something
3475 2018-09-13 06:42:50 I think logic dictates that OPCW can only ever say 'as far as we are aware..' and regarding Syria it was 'declared stocks of CW' and of course OPCW can't advise re what was not declared, unless thay can see it. Any country may have hidden stocks of CW.

after kicking out Hyuna and Edawn Cubes stocks just keeps going down...to the hell they belong to

3478 2018-09-13 06:39:45 Yeah, Firing your most popular artist and watching your stocks fucking plummet was a great business decision. Just because G-Idle has a couple songs doesn't mean they can carry the company.
3479 2018-09-13 06:38:19 Cube Entertainment was cancelled ever since the BEAST’s scandal, but now? They are officially fucked up, their stocks are dropping. HyunA carried that company in her own for years, E’Dawn invested his whole self for PENTAGON. Cube is dead for me.
3480 2018-09-13 06:37:55 So Cube removed Hyuna and Edawn .Ok then you can’t use any songs produced by them and if you do,then we will get the shit out of you. Like really how will you live,your stocks are already going down.Sorry (G)Idle and Pentagon,I love you but this is bad!

3485 2018-09-13 06:34:46 Ok this is the econ major in me coming out, but rn is a good time to buy stocks in cube. I know it sounds crazy, but the price is so low, and if you invest long term, youll make profit off it
3486 2018-09-13 06:34:10 i really don't think cube would've left their top artist in the gutter . i'm not a ptg stan but even i know edawn made good music?? so. really valuable assets + firing them = obv stock plummet?? they even lied abt their rs at first which shows they care abt stocks a lot?? so

All in all we know hyuna will b okay career wise but edawn................ man idk.... this is all very shitty 

Cube is gonna take a huge hit in their stocks I bet 
3490 2018-09-13 06:32:30 Cube literally gained nothing from their decision except they let crazy fans think their in control of their faves and making their stocks drop. This is another level of stupid.

3501 2018-09-13 06:28:46 i read it was cause they went against cube when they went public but that's still such bs; if they're worried abt stocks dropping and things like that well look what this decision got them lmao :/

3505 2018-09-13 06:27:26 Anything beyond top 500 stocks are  illiquid for a fund to be able to buy; and there are over 2000 mutual funds (and even more PMS guys trying to buy out of these 500). This restraint can be great for retail.... only if you can find the next stock to enter in this league of 500!
3506 2018-09-13 06:27:10 it’s their loss. literally their stocks are dropping

3509 2018-09-13 06:25:37 Lol their stocks dropped after the news was released in the public. So i dont think that the shareholders were the one who decided to kicked them out of the company.
3510 2018-09-13 06:24:02 So I said to one of the head dudes at the event who puffed banking stocks as an idea- "Umn,Don't u think real estate is going to affect banking stocks?"Got the-deer in the headlight look"VERY funny.
3511 2018-09-13 06:23:53 me: it's going doooown, i'm yelling timbeeer

them: you're singing kesha?

me: no, i'm singing about cube's stocks after they kicked out hyuna
3512 2018-09-13 06:23:23 Rather than make cube's stocks go down which only hurts the idols under them, we should support hyuna and e'dawn TEN times more than we normally do when they come back whatever company they are in. #ilyHyunaAndEDawn
3513 2018-09-13 06:23:08 Exactly, what people around here lack is the right info about market and its investment opportunities. They're still suspecious about investing in stocks.

3532 2018-09-13 06:17:30 I AM SO CONFLICTED BECAUSE CUBE IS LOSING STOCKS AND LIKE THEY DESERVE IT BUT THAT ALSO MEANS THAT THE OTHER MEMBERS OF PENTAGON ARE GOING TO SUFFER AND THEY DONT DESERVE THAT SHIT
3533 2018-09-13 06:17:28 No I'm not saying it directly to you but more to anyone that thinks like that bc tbh it's sad. Pentagon loves edawn and they never wished for him to leave but now cube makes him and their stocks are getting so low that it's not even sure what will happen to them as a group st all
3534 2018-09-13 06:17:04 cube’s stocks are falling again. they deserve it, but I feel so bad for the members of pentagon and (G)I-DLE... #CubeIsCancelledParty
3535 2018-09-13 06:16:27 ohhh yekeee tapi an kena edawn pun kenaaaaa dahlah sampai cube punya stocks menurun do sbb buang doranggg
3536 2018-09-13 06:16:20 ...if the company does not take a hit economically they WILL pull shit on their employees again. being happy that the stocks are taking a hit over fucking their employees over is a good thing, not a bad one.

3541 2018-09-13 06:15:11 but for real Cube, what the fuck this can't even be called something that's "for the good of the company" i mean the stocks DROPPED. Value DIPPED. Hyuna made a name for Cube and they kicked her to the curb. At this point idk what could save them
3542 2018-09-13 06:15:00 YES!  That's a great closing number!

3553 2018-09-13 06:10:23 the company failing their employees making the stocks drop... is literally the company's fault and maybe those losses will make them treat their artists better, or maybe the company just burns and the artists can go elsewhere to companies that may not commit the same dumb choices

3556 2018-09-13 06:09:51 Cube's stocks are down by 7% so they better say sike now or another company is going to snatch Hyuna and E'Dawn

3560 2018-09-13 06:08:39 why cube’s gonna lose money after kicking hyuna and edawn out:
- hyuna was a strong backbone
- her albums were gr8
- she was a great idol
- triple h
- no more hyuna = no more albums from her meaning lower stocks
-edawn was one of their best rookies
-he’s in pentagon and tH
- oof
3561 2018-09-13 06:08:15 LMAOOOO CUBES STOCKS HAVE DROPPED ITS HIGHKEY WHAT THEY DESERVE but the artists still in that hell hole don't deserve it or to even be there
3562 2018-09-13 06:08:12 I get the feeling Cube is going to change their minds on what they just did and let Hyuna and E’Dawn stay in the label after what going on and all the negativity they are getting now and stocks going down . Do you guys agree?
3563 2018-09-13 06:08:10 also cubes stocks going down isn’t a good thing guys that’s just gonna affect other artists’ careers and they’re gonna get overworked

3566 2018-09-13 06:06:52 Cube's stocks are dropping after kicking Hyuna out because Hyuna is basically the pillar that supported and built Cube after all these 11 years.

3576 2018-09-13 06:03:25 Good observation. Another weird thing is EM are weak and under stress, geopolitics is a risk, tariffs, still US stock market rocks. Spot on on sentiment - bullish trend to continue in stocks

3578 2018-09-13 06:03:17 It wasn't just them that caused the stocks to drop. It was the 3+ dating rumors that came out that caused them to drop but it was all thrown on hyuna and edawn cause theirs was confirmed.

3584 2018-09-13 05:59:39 gonna wait for cube stocks dropping like london bridge
falling down, falling down 
3585 2018-09-13 05:59:30 How bad are Cube's stocks now lmao
3586 2018-09-13 05:59:16 Where’s the SEC on pump and dump stocks like this 
3587 2018-09-13 05:58:01 cube ent. stocks are dropping faster than my grades
3588 2018-09-13 05:57:09 Married and having kids, but if someone like hyuna gets kicked out their company after 11 years and after being the main bread winner if the company, what does that say to newer idols and smaller companies. Maybe they’ll take cubes stocks dropping as reason not to follow suit but
3589 2018-09-13 05:56:39 HyunA and E'dawn (&& Hui) were literally the only ones left in Cube that are BIG. Cube's stocks are gonna plummet. They're so ridiculous!!
3590 2018-09-13 05:56:21 I dont think that's bullshit at all but i still see TA working because it's all a game of algos and this is a part of it. It's the same algo game in other asset classes like in stocks too. I like these posts very much! Keep em coming! 
3591 2018-09-13 05:56:05 Anyways gambling is stigmatic because the collective odds are literally stacked against you (casino business) or there is evident uncertainty (stocks). I don't think gambling really applies to what you're getting at.
3592 2018-09-13 05:52:46 Cube's stocks are plummeting but I can't help but feel bad for the other artists
3593 2018-09-13 05:52:17 Cube Entertainment stocks be dropping lower then my grades  Good. Finish them. 

#CubeisoverParty
3594 2018-09-13 05:51:05 ay nako besh legit something is fishy. BUSINESS NGA LANG TALAGA LAHAT AT THE END OF THE DAY. kasi kung pinapahalagahan nila ung artist nila ipaglalaban nila yan relationship na yan hindi ung kung bumaba man ung stocks nila or whatevs
3595 2018-09-13 05:50:22 No wonder for-profit prison stocks are through the roof
3596 2018-09-13 05:48:43 Since the stocks are low, FANS BETTER TAKE ADVANTAGE AND BUY THE STOCKS!!! CUBE NEEDS A NEW CEO
3597 2018-09-13 05:48:12 That's awesome. Thanks bro. 

One more point is : His own rule also same. In his own portfolio, none of the stocks can cross 10%.

3599 2018-09-13 05:46:43 If we took the same approach as we do when shopping for clothes, whitegoods, pretty much any good other than stocks,  we would buy more. Funny how stocks are one of the few things that become more attractive to people as prices go up. 
3600 2018-09-13 05:45:21 Today, Twitterkins, is all about Tax Returns. This makes it a Not Good Day. However, stocks of chocolate bics are on standby, and I'm Ready To Go!
3601 2018-09-13 05:45:19 Its okay dear tbh I understand people talking about those 2 but some actually wish for their stocks to dump and that would just be sad for all those other amazing artists that didnt do anything but will feel the effects of cube their choices

3603 2018-09-13 05:45:01 Perhaps someone could look at the tannoy system at Basildon. It us obvious that an announcement is being given but it isn’t audible!!!
3604 2018-09-13 05:44:25 Cube’s stocks taking a nosedive after kicking out two of their artists for the clearly unforgivable crime of — gasp — faLLinG iN LoVe aNd DAtInG?!! That’s what they deserve. I hope BTOB, CLC, G-Idle and the rest of Pentagon manage to bow out too because w o w   #CubeIsOverParty
3605 2018-09-13 05:44:16 what the fuck is cube's stocks doing lmao
3606 2018-09-13 05:43:16 Exactly my problem Junk. Can’t sleep owning these kind of stocks.
3607 2018-09-13 05:43:12 In this market, which quality stocks took beating
3608 2018-09-13 05:43:03 HyunA and E’Dawn worked hard to get where they are. HyunA was literally the backbone of cube. She was the majority of their income. She did that for 11 years. From a business standpoint they still messed up. They just lost a huge percentage of their money. Look at their stocks.
3609 2018-09-13 05:42:53 A broader point though on why your comment is nonsensical. In autumn of 1999, many value-conscious investors were negative on tech stocks. They were proven correct--the Nasdaq dropped 60% over the ensuing three years. One problem--it first doubled in 6 months, then dropped 83%.
3610 2018-09-13 05:42:53 Cube's stocks are dropping
That's what you get for treating your artists like shit 
They literally used edawn, he helped produce songs for the comeback and that's what they do to fucking repay him
3611 2018-09-13 05:42:50 I love watching cube’s stocks go down as hyuna and edawn laugh in their faces
3612 2018-09-13 05:42:44 And pigs will fly!!!
3613 2018-09-13 05:42:35 Actually @TRAI should ban @reliancejio for their scam in the name of #4G 
They are actually giving 2G speed.
3614 2018-09-13 05:42:13 Not everyone is publicly traded. If people can't make money buying stocks, they won't buy it. Leaving the company and it's employees in a bad way.

3621 2018-09-13 05:38:48 cube deserves the lowest after kicking out HyunA. she carried almost all of your stocks for years! #CubeIsOverParty

3625 2018-09-13 05:37:26 They wouldn’t be shit and they wouldn’t have shit, now the few groups that they do have are gonna be working hella hard. Apparently Cube’s stocks are already dropping
3626 2018-09-13 05:37:19 Great stocks and analysis.
3627 2018-09-13 05:36:14 cube truly stupid like if they thought hyuna and hyojong dating ruined their stocks wait till they see what DROPPING them altogether is gonna do
3628 2018-09-13 05:35:53 I think we get treated pretty darn well.  I have a living wage, full medical benefits, bonuses, stocks, PTO & UPT hours.  They give away prizes during the busy seasons (gift cards to gaming systems to days off to 55" TVs.) Lots of ways to promote.  Skill building classes.

3630 2018-09-13 05:34:40 BYE BYE CUBE STOCKS LOL
3631 2018-09-13 05:34:34 yeah that was a bad decision on their part bc their stocks are decreasing since the news was released
3632 2018-09-13 05:33:57 Instead of buying apple products invest into there stocks it’s only 210$
3633 2018-09-13 05:33:36 Gani te. Gago gid ya. Kag kamango pa. Kundi ang stocks nila lalo nagplummet padalom. 
3634 2018-09-13 05:33:31 I'll meet and raise you. I'm currently 300% short (Russell 2000 and an assortment of high-beta stocks and ETFs: NVDA, XBI, CAT, BABA, MS, NFLX, ARCB.

3635 2018-09-13 05:33:20 @cubeunited
I only have this to say: congratulations Cube, you managed to fuck up. You chased two of the most talented artists I've ever seen, one of whom is the one who has been carrying all Cube Ent on her back for ten years. Congratulations on your stocks going down now.
3636 2018-09-13 05:33:17 The only good news is seeing CUBE’s stocks go down—-
3637 2018-09-13 05:32:49 TRUSTis a very big issue in Korea. CUBE's stocks went down after the couple revealed their relationship. CUBE earns more domestically. I GUESS to save the company, meaning their OTHER artists, this decision has to be made.T T
3638 2018-09-13 05:32:42 Be a group now missing 1 member but mostly close friend and also face some of the concequences really is that happened with their stocks. Again hyuna and edawn have it hardest and its fucked up but there sadly are others that will feel this as well bc of cube
3639 2018-09-13 05:32:09 I think it's not according to Indian regulations. I think It's according to Pabrai's group rules that none of the stocks can cross 10%. Please correct me if I am wrong.

Guru also entered into IEX, NO BRAINER'S STOCK

3641 2018-09-13 05:31:54 goodluck sa stocks nila. i mean yes andyan btob (pero magmimilitary na yang mga yan) andyan g-idle and pentagon (yes rising stars, pero RISING pa lang). Hello daming raket and sobrang sikat ni Hyuna. Tapos???? Sobrang bs

3643 2018-09-13 05:30:26 I realised that money in FD is less attractive than index fund or Top10 Index stocks in portfolio for 20years.
3644 2018-09-13 05:29:56 with cube’s stocks literally plummeting and the careers of not only hyuna and (especially) edawn + ptg, but also the other cube artists, at risk, i cant see how cube thought the solution to this situation was kicking out their most successful artist and a talented idol-composer

3646 2018-09-13 05:28:01 Their stocks are up. Your counting is terrible.

You're fired.
3647 2018-09-13 05:27:11 Cubes stocks dropped faster than I can drop my ass
3648 2018-09-13 05:26:59 Today stocks lower; EUR/USD 1.164; bund yield 0.412%; 10-year Treasury 2.969%; brent $79.3; gold $1204.6 Watch: BoE interest rate decision, ECB interest rate announcement
3649 2018-09-13 05:26:47 tbh I understand why cube would do that cos they actly were tryna cover up but it’s p dumb to let go of your cash cow like that!!! and their stocks are dropping so hm.
3650 2018-09-13 05:26:38 I seriously don’t get CUBE Entertainment for kicking out HyunA I mean their stocks rocketed when she and E’Dawn revealed their relationship. AND we shouldn’t forget the fact how HyunA became the breadwinner of CUBE after 4MINUTE’s disbandment and BEAST’s contract expiration.
3651 2018-09-13 05:25:52 They own more stock in their company, that is more valuable than before they bought it. So they are going to turn those stocks into more wealth....
3652 2018-09-13 05:25:17 some of yall celebrating the fact that cube stocks are dropping... that aint it
3653 2018-09-13 05:23:56 With the help of those toxic kfans~~THANK YOU CUBE! The worst decision had ever made. Being too confident with your other artists.. Let's see how your stocks fall.. Feel so sorry for matured universe and A-ing out there.. They feel devastated and for sure. 
3654 2018-09-13 05:23:33 people are happy cube's stocks are dropping but this affects the other artists the most
3655 2018-09-13 05:22:17 ...is this a joke? Like...cube...sweetie. The fuck is wrong with you? They really went ahead and dug their own graves huh... I laughed when I saw that their stocks crashed but I know it’s gonna hurt the idols that are still there so wow yeah this is just a whole shit show and-
3656 2018-09-13 05:22:08 cube losing stocks??? not surprised
3657 2018-09-13 05:21:28 They’ll be fine they are great artist. I’m not worried for them. Cube is the one with the biggest lost there stocks are going down the drain
3658 2018-09-13 05:21:05 oh shit I wonder if their stocks will be effected
3659 2018-09-13 05:20:38 It invest those round ups into stocks. It’s really a way for you to be smart with your money and save for the future. Like right now, I’m saving up $20 a week from now until January to use for TOTY. Just a tool to help honestly
3660 2018-09-13 05:20:12 Yeah, it’s just if people continue to support them then it seems like it’s okay for them trap their idols like this. But thankfully the collective agrees that this is wrong and that’s why their stocks are going down. Hopefully, all agencies can learn from this in the future.
3661 2018-09-13 05:19:53 Great loss Cube.  We are talking about HyunA here. QUEEN HYUNA to be specific. You just kick our Queen? Really cube? Can't wait to see all cube's stocks falling down because HyunA is no longer in their ent.
3662 2018-09-13 05:19:22 She was one of the, if not the biggest money maker for cube. Their stocks keep on going down. I think cube fucked up and deserve what they get. That's all I'm going to say
3663 2018-09-13 05:19:21 Cubes stocks going down rapidly is exactly what they deserve
3664 2018-09-13 05:19:09 Definitely not good on a business side either seeing as how their stocks are currently dropping like flies and they’re bound to lose a ton of endorsements and sponsors
3665 2018-09-13 05:18:57 L M A O 
Cube stocks going
3666 2018-09-13 05:18:30 I swear, watching cube's stocks fall is the only joy im getting today

I can see their stocks and reputation dropping as hard and low as that comet that destroyed and killed an entire era of dinosaurs smh. 
Like I LOVE all their artists cause theyre so talented and great funny people, but CUBE...  disappointed

3675 2018-09-13 05:15:48 Damnnnnn Cube's stocks going DOWN
3676 2018-09-13 05:15:29 There is no "Manipulation". Such a big market with huge floating stocks cannot be "Manipulated"

3678 2018-09-13 05:14:42 iPhone X officially discontinued. You can only buy what’s still in stock. No new production. So prices will fall just 200 dhs below the XS, till stocks last.

3684 2018-09-13 05:12:36 cube’s stocks r dropping again i have to laugh this is what u get for being so ugly !
3685 2018-09-13 05:12:36 y'all keep laughing at the stocks but that only means more work for the other artists
3686 2018-09-13 05:12:34 if hyuna truly didnt return any investments then why are their stocks plummeted so bad after she got kicked out 
3687 2018-09-13 05:11:40 Stocks are up!
3688 2018-09-13 05:11:24 Can’t wait to watch cubes stocks drop right into the Void for good
3689 2018-09-13 05:10:19 Cube’s stocks are gonna D R O P
3690 2018-09-13 05:09:38 I hope @cubeunited stocks drop all the way into hell bc that’s where the company belongs
3691 2018-09-13 05:09:24 Have you send their stocks to. They’ve lost 6%(a lot!) in just 2 1/2-3 hrs. They may really go bankrupt.
3692 2018-09-13 05:09:07 So Cube Entetaiment just kicked out 2 of their biggest stars. LOL?! I see dem stocks falling down quickly by the hour. 
3693 2018-09-13 05:09:06 يعني باقي فقط 6 جلسات تداول
3694 2018-09-13 05:08:50 I have very mixed feelings about Cube's stocks dropping because they still have a lot of artists under them and they're gonna suffer so much because of this. Kicking out Hyuna and E'Dawn was such a dumb move oh my god
3695 2018-09-13 05:08:29 oof cube's stocks
3696 2018-09-13 05:08:17 Ambot naunsa na na, nigawas ras feed nko. Niubos gud maayo stocks sa Cube rn hahaha
3697 2018-09-13 05:08:02 $PEN - Uranium.. could run away a bit over the next few days the way uranium stocks are going before it goes back down to fill that gap.
 I'm in. 
3698 2018-09-13 05:06:45 @cubeunited fuck y’all for all of this bullshit. I hope it was worth it to make a few crybaby possessive kfans happy as y’all watch your company’s stocks go down the toilet
3699 2018-09-13 05:06:32 Basically Cube’s stocks have gone down already. I hope this shitty company burns to ashes and the artists find some company that can appreciate their hard work.
3700 2018-09-13 05:06:13 Cube's stocks: *slutdrops to Babe by Hyuna*
3701 2018-09-13 05:04:36 or if you can refund the money , that also works and I can schedule my flight once again as soon I get my passports.
3702 2018-09-13 05:04:25 best thing to do is manipulate google stocks :p
3703 2018-09-13 05:04:17 and now it appears that stocks are low in milk, bread and canned perishables in most of the local area. So I was fortunate to get of most of that stuff.
3704 2018-09-13 05:04:15 I hope Cube's stocks continue to freefall
3705 2018-09-13 05:04:08 cube is dumb . they didn't even think about their stocks & sales going down before making a decision. they just thought abt the crazy fans that got shit mad abt it and didnt think abt the future of their company. this is a bigger lose for them than it is for hyuna and hyojong 
3706 2018-09-13 05:04:01 Hi everyone, new stock at your local friendly gametrades,

As well as some 2018 comic con summer convention POP left so come in and grab em while stocks last.
3707 2018-09-13 05:03:24 so many of the fans are happy cube stocks are falling but what about the groups?
if they go bankrupt they dont have a company anymore..
3708 2018-09-13 05:03:19 It's whatever their stocks will go down and they'll rethink their life decisions and will become a smol company
3709 2018-09-13 05:03:17 CUBE: Kicks out Hyuna and E'dawn = Stocks diving down to search for Atlantis

3715 2018-09-13 05:01:46 lmao hyuna brought all the money to cube and did up until she got kicked out. that was a shitty choice they made bc it was only a small group of fans they didnt even consider international fans and now their decision caused their stocks to plummet lmaooooo how sad
3716 2018-09-13 05:01:20 their stocks are dropping too last time i checked.... 
3717 2018-09-13 05:01:04 Buy up all Cube Entertainment Stocks from their wack ass company, shut it down. Change the regime and save the remaining artist there because you need a company that will protect your human rights to be in a relationship/love. Idgaf, Shut it down and take their stocks with you.

3721 2018-09-13 05:00:15 I'm always so pressed abt using homemade stocks and shit trying to be different but I've realized that even the greats use Google stocks 
3722 2018-09-13 04:59:02 :(  why they treat dating as some kind of crime? N why the fans can’t accept it? Total bs :| it’s hysterical that someone dating is causing fall in their stocks.. ki weird obostha re bhai :/
3723 2018-09-13 04:58:32 ついにオルトとAbalance損切り完了。
オルトは２年弱、お世話になりました。まさか大損で終わるとは。。。

今年は実現損50万overの匂い。。

家の売却益（いくらか知らんが）と相殺できるんだっけか？
3724 2018-09-13 04:58:28 @CAM3R0NPH1L1P cube stocks are already plummeting...
3725 2018-09-13 04:58:21 Number of leading stocks today: 78 $SPY $QQQ $FB $GOOG $AMZN $GOOG $AAPL #DailyStkLeaderCount
3726 2018-09-13 04:58:14 LMAO yeah i think their stocks dropped like 8-9% in an hour. i hope cube is happy with their decision, even when they go under. and that they'll at least be a decent enough company to help all their artists once they fail, and not just throw them under the bus.
3727 2018-09-13 04:58:08 unfortunately this tweet is in the wrong language, it’s not the international fans that were the problem, it was the korean fans that caused stocks to drop and threw a huge fit due to toxic idol culture
3728 2018-09-13 04:57:10 i’m fr gonna keep major alerts on for cube’s stocks i gotta see where this thing goes
3729 2018-09-13 04:56:28 actually/ check the # you’ll see the stocks it was like -150% or smn
3730 2018-09-13 04:56:21 The stocks are down by 8 fcking percent wtfff
3731 2018-09-13 04:55:37 watching cube’s stocks drop is really satisfying 
#CUBEOVERPARTY
3732 2018-09-13 04:55:25 on the one hand, Cube's stocks dropping rapidly gives me relief because this means their management decision to let go of their two most valuable artists was, indeed, a bad decision,and they are now suffering the consequences. +
3733 2018-09-13 04:54:49 Kicking those two out is the absolute worst way to handle the situation sdfasfd its super Bad for business im already reeling imaging how the stocks would look like after this
3734 2018-09-13 04:54:44 rip cube’s stocks
3735 2018-09-13 04:54:33 As of 1:35 PM their stocks have dropped 8.42% I'm laughing so hard
3736 2018-09-13 04:54:25 Kicking out your money maker and watching your stocks decline. Wow. Karma is fast as lightning
3737 2018-09-13 04:54:22 At least they ddnt end the contract with them. That says a lot. Anyway KELFs stocks aren't enough to affect a money giant like SM so it's just a matter of time. Suju has thier own label so Suju has a lot of say in who stays too
3738 2018-09-13 04:54:09 If there's less than 180 then I think Nintendo is doomed guys, after all their stocks are down 10 yen
3739 2018-09-13 04:54:04 Look at cube's stocks plunging haha
3740 2018-09-13 04:54:02 Watching Cube Entertainment's stocks plummet rn is ver satisfying, but I'm worried about the bois still stuck with them. Pentagon deserves better. And Hui must be devastated rn.
3741 2018-09-13 04:53:53 Hell no, they just made the biggest mistake they could have made! Not only did they cave to the delusional fans, disregarding everyone that has been supporting the relationship, but from a business perspective they have ruined their own company; their stocks are plummeting.
3742 2018-09-13 04:53:50 One difference is Cash flows & another one is even if someone bought at this rich valuations one can sure of return of capital,but not possible in real estate stocks.
3743 2018-09-13 04:53:38 Cube's stocks have gonna down 9% and counting
3744 2018-09-13 04:53:38 Let's see how low Cube's stocks are gonna get from now to when I wake up
3745 2018-09-13 04:52:20 Kindly share your booking number via DM @wowairsupport. -Sophia
3746 2018-09-13 04:51:48 Actually they do. Presidents. They have a huge say on economy. I.e Why did the Consumer confidence shoot way out of the ball park the DAY trump got elected? Why did all the stocks rise? I appreciate that dems hate the fact the Trump is a success I get it. But get over it.
3747 2018-09-13 04:51:38 Sorry to say this but Korean fans that wanted Edawn out are delusional AF. No members are ever gonna date you, so get a life Stop trying to ruin peoples careers/lives.@cubeunited ur the worst and even dumber than those delusional k-fans Hopefully your stocks keep dropping As for+
3748 2018-09-13 04:50:55 I have a thread on how to fuck frozen chickens& use them for dinner afterwards on a car forum's politics side. I was trying to show what limiting access to birth control would mean for their dreams of getting laid,now I'm beginning to think they went out and bought poultry stocks
3749 2018-09-13 04:50:47 Don’t kill me but I’m dead ass comparing Cube entertainment’s stocks to JYP entertainment stock and  I’m dead ass cracking up
3750 2018-09-13 04:50:44 Stock buy backs are on pace to reach $1 Trillion Dollars this year, while average yearly earnings in real dollars, is on pace to decrease by $4.8 Billion #StockMarketIsNotTheEconomy #wallstreet #stocks #publicpolicy #TaxCutsandJobsAct #business
3751 2018-09-13 04:49:54 Their stocks are plummeting SO bad because of this bullshit. Bout as stupid as a move you can do.
3752 2018-09-13 04:47:56 cube's stocks falling is the funniest thing. good it's what they deserve
3753 2018-09-13 04:47:17 Guess who's stocks are going DOWN DOWN BABY
#CubeIsOverParty
3754 2018-09-13 04:47:06 cube just made one of their biggest mistakes for this shit and gon regret it when their stocks go even lower than before and then when they hit up hyuna asking her to come back she gon say no and they gon end up looking like boo boo the fools
3755 2018-09-13 04:47:03 Cube stocks are now down a 9.43%
3756 2018-09-13 04:46:56 My trades are not based on macro news. My systems have gone into positional sells on Nifty and quite a few pivotal stocks , hence I am bearish
3757 2018-09-13 04:46:31 Hyuna and E'Dawn got kicked out of Cube Ent. This is so disgusting. I'm so sad for them. Cube Ent. should be ashamed of themselves. Have fun watching your stocks drop
3758 2018-09-13 04:46:26 @wow_air - Can you please help me. I did not get my passport so I wont be able to fly on Saturday. Can you please help me reschedule the flights without charging as I am not at fault here .
3759 2018-09-13 04:46:20 Now cubes stocks are going down... i feel bad for pentagon clc but it's what Cube deserves honestly
3760 2018-09-13 04:46:19 Cube's stocks are falling faster than bitcoin
#CubeIsOverParty #CubeisCancelled
3761 2018-09-13 04:46:17 Watch cube ent stocks drop like grapes 
3762 2018-09-13 04:46:11 I made a killing “shorting” dildo stocks!
3763 2018-09-13 04:46:08 $AUD + $ASX specs stocks = Bottom out Together .. as Warned
 ...all Month
3764 2018-09-13 04:46:04 I don't follow Pentagon that much, but from what I'm told he was pretty much the center of their last comeback. Sucks for the fans. :(

Read about the stocks too. Wow. Not surprised
3765 2018-09-13 04:45:46 Question for the day: 

Why are stocks the only thing people won't buy when they are on sale? 

Think about it..........
3766 2018-09-13 04:45:29 can’t wait till cube’s stocks go down 
3767 2018-09-13 04:45:27 hmmm...point made! Grabe ung drop ng stocks nila after the news. Feeling ko tama ka.
3768 2018-09-13 04:45:25 again y’all still ain’t understand stocks
3769 2018-09-13 04:45:19 Cube ent stocks keeps going down after the news lmao thats what they deserve
3770 2018-09-13 04:45:16 I just feel so terrible for the rest of the pentagon boys and cube artists as well. The stocks are falling so rapidly and of the company really does go bankrupt then newer groups and the rest of the pentagon boys will never get to fully live up to their potential.
3771 2018-09-13 04:45:15 OH MY GOD THE LAST I CHECKES STOCKS WERE AT - 5.89 N THEY WENT TO -7

 LO R DT
I WEMT AGAIN TO CHECK IF MY NUMBER WAS RIGHT AND NOW ITS AT - 8

3772 2018-09-13 04:44:49 Hey!! I am going to give advice to people with money who want to invest in financial stocks. Buy SNAP AMZN SPOT RACE NKE T #GodIsGood
3773 2018-09-13 04:44:43 the massive drop in stocks is happening
3774 2018-09-13 04:44:43 it doesn't even matter how edawn is the most popular member of pentagon. it doesn't even matter how hyuna literally made fucking cube. it doesn't even matter how cube's stocks are going to crash. what matters is both artists should've been treated better. 

yg and ts can't relate
3775 2018-09-13 04:44:39 Before buying any automated signal generator think twice. Would you give away a magic wand for money? Either the tool is flawed or your confidence is. Learn to design your own #Tradingsetup #finance #trading #stocks #nifty #banknifty #beentheredonethat #inspiration
3776 2018-09-13 04:43:01 People trying to say they understand the business decision Cube has to make. What about the business of Cube’s stocks dropping through the floor & Hyuna & Edawn leaving to go make someone else big $$? Sounds like a bad business move to me. 

#CubeIsCancelledParty #CubeIsOverParty
3777 2018-09-13 04:42:31 cube's stocks dropping so much that's so sad alexa play 365 fresh
3778 2018-09-13 04:42:29 I found my new hobby: Watching Cube's stocks go down
3779 2018-09-13 04:42:27 Apple stocks are about to fucking thriveeeeee baby
3780 2018-09-13 04:42:20 Are you fucking serious I literally cannot believe this how they gonna kick out HYUNA your stocks are gonna drop below ground
3781 2018-09-13 04:41:59 cube lost their #1 money maker and one of their best song writers. aside from this being fucked up morally its definitely gonna affect cubes stocks.
3782 2018-09-13 04:41:50 After having awesome first 6 months plus with stock trading, I am having such a bad luck with stocks ever since $TWTR ER shook me bad, snow ball effect. Oh boy.
3783 2018-09-13 04:41:12 pentagon lost one of their members and cube kicked out the person who got them where they are today. not only that their stocks are dropping and the remaining artists will be held responsible and pushed harder. This is all such a mess 
3784 2018-09-13 04:40:38 CUBE’S STOCKS DROPPING IN AN INSTANT, THAT BITCH COMPANY DESERVES IT
3785 2018-09-13 04:40:37 Oops... cube's stocks are spiralling down
3786 2018-09-13 04:40:01 Stocks may rise and fall, utilities and transportation systems may collapse, people are no damn good, but they will always need porn
3787 2018-09-13 04:39:53 oksy yeah i was joking about cube’s stocks but honestly. i’m really scared for what’s gonna happen to all the artists esp pentagon
3788 2018-09-13 04:39:37 Dude their stocks are still dropping like crazy
3789 2018-09-13 04:39:36 All I gotta say is "bye bye cube" cause their stocks are dropping faster than the corner hoes drawers. I hope they go under so their artists can find companies that deserve their talent. I wish I would hug all of pentagon as I flipped cube off and walked them out the door.
3790 2018-09-13 04:39:34 Of course stocks are going to go down after three like this. It doesn’t necessarily mean that it’ll stay that way though, most companies go through stock drops after scandals by get back to they almost always go back to their normal range soon after
3791 2018-09-13 04:39:00 cube's stocks is going way down and u know what?? thats what they deserve
3792 2018-09-13 04:38:41 The stocks keep dropping 
3793 2018-09-13 04:38:29 Jokes are them because now their stocks went down even worse then before
3794 2018-09-13 04:38:13 Cube firing Hyuna and E’Dawn doesn’t just effect them. It affects every single Cube artist and staff member. Their stocks are plummeting and there could very well be no Cube Entertainment in the near future. Cube just decapitated themselves.
3795 2018-09-13 04:38:07 HAHAHAHAHA CUBE STOCKS
3796 2018-09-13 04:37:24 holy ufck everyone's gonna be overworked if the stocks are dropping etc please keep supporting every single artist of cube please
3797 2018-09-13 04:36:59 Omg the stocks are down by 6% now...
3798 2018-09-13 04:36:54 Wait for your stocks to hit rock bottom.
3799 2018-09-13 04:36:43 I mean if you think about it. CLC is not doing THAT well, Btob is in military stages. pentagons obviously affected now i mean jfc. They no longer have hyuna. So really gidles their biggest seller now but honestly this is affecting the whole company. Stocks are going down etc
3800 2018-09-13 04:36:41 Cube doesn’t have a dating ban so it makes no sense for them to be kicked out for dating. Overall, cube is suffering with stocks now since they’ve gone down so now they’re seeing the consequences.
3801 2018-09-13 04:35:27 I remember when weed had the special meeting their was an agenda as to what we would vote on such as the stock split. I will look around to see if APH has an agenda in one of the news releases.
3802 2018-09-13 04:34:59 Gold stocks have been virtually the same trade as EMs this past month - off a cliff. They also responded with a rally today. The world against US and USD - like a fault line.
3803 2018-09-13 04:34:50 Simply put: Amazon allows manufacturers to sell direct avoiding all retail costs. Besides selling online,  Costco stocks a warehouse, with their brand (Kirkland) and other consignment products (no inventory costs). Their buying power allows them to work off of a 15% margin
3804 2018-09-13 04:34:32 their stocks are PLUMMETING hyuna carried cube on her back so they fucked
3805 2018-09-13 04:34:30 Cube stocks are dropping so fast lmao....bighit will surely hold on to bts forever
3806 2018-09-13 04:34:29 Glad Cube's stocks are tanking after doing this. Hyuna and E'Dawn didn't deserve this just cause they're happy together. They wanted to be honest and they get f'd over for it.
3807 2018-09-13 04:34:26 Well that didn't take long.. for the stocks to plunge i mean sjsksjskjs
3808 2018-09-13 04:34:16 I've been a Universe since debut, I also Stan Hyuna and BTOB and I'm using that tag because it's true. Cube are ruining their own company, their stocks are falling. Hyuna and Hyojong deserve better. Sit down please, there's a good reason people are mad.
3809 2018-09-13 04:33:28 Idk how to feel about their stocks plummeting , on one hand I’m happy because it’s what they deserve but on the other hand I am sad because they still have a lot of artist under them:///
3810 2018-09-13 04:33:25 Someone actually looked up the stocks. Bless
3811 2018-09-13 04:32:42 omg cube's stocks have dropped so much lmaoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
3812 2018-09-13 04:32:16 Untuk masalah ini ya tidak ada yang tahu alasan pastinya. Hanya orang dibalik layar yang tau kenapa cube really gone this far. Kira-kira alasan apa yang membuat cube memilih rugi karena stocks turun dengan keukeuh nendang aset berharganya? Harusnya sih bukan alasan sepele
3813 2018-09-13 04:32:01 Bro cube's stocks are still dropping
3814 2018-09-13 04:32:00 This whole situation is a mess. I can't believe that they did this...cube entertainment didnt deserve either one of them. I heard that cube entertainment stocks are plummeting.
3815 2018-09-13 04:31:10 but honestly watching cube’s stocks drop is so satisfying
3816 2018-09-13 04:31:09 perhaps the consolation we all have here is that hyuna is probably somewhere watching cube stocks fall down and smiling triumphantly after the shit they've done to her and her boo. she still wins.
3817 2018-09-13 04:31:08 I was wrong but still made money on it.  Money to be made on negative stocks
3818 2018-09-13 04:30:51 I’m really shook at the fact that edawn produced the latest title track for pentagon and then they kicked him out...y’all pretty much stole from him and now will profit off of that im...watching the stocks decline??
3819 2018-09-13 04:30:01 Their stocks have went into a downward spiral into the red.
3820 2018-09-13 04:29:52 Honestly im just fucking pissed at cube. Watch their stocks drop. I hope ptg is healthy and doing well and Hyojong and Hyunah are okay.
3821 2018-09-13 04:29:20 bumaba tuloy stocks ng cube lol
3822 2018-09-13 04:29:12 I really wanna say I HOPE cubes stocks fucking crash after this and the company goes to shit...
but like if that happens then what about all the other artist under cube ya know
3823 2018-09-13 04:29:05 Thanks for posting this Eagle. I went through the video and since with $APH their is a vote on the 19th I am thinking that we should get $DEO news at least by Monday or on Monday if it is a go so their would be something to vote on.... IMHO 
3824 2018-09-13 04:28:59 Watch Edawn and Hyuna open an own company and surpassing cube in sales amd stocks ;) #CubeIsOverParty
3825 2018-09-13 04:28:48 I swear to god if cube makes pentagon or has made pentagon sign a slave contract now that their stocks are about to plummet I will fucking sell my soul to round up enough money to get them out if it because those boys deserve mORE THAN THAT HYOJONG& HYUNA DESERVED MORE THAN THAT
3826 2018-09-13 04:28:47 fuck cube entertainment being a part of an entertainment company does not mean that someone cant be in love, lets all watch the company stocks drop and hype hyunA and edawn.
3827 2018-09-13 04:27:54 cube has not only ruined their stocks and their image, but they’re going to ruin all of the hardworking, talented artists and groups within the company. this has to be the biggest mistake they’ve ever made
3828 2018-09-13 04:27:46 @cubeunited ENJOY YOUR PLUMMETING STOCKS, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLES
3829 2018-09-13 04:27:44 Low floats you need to watch for possible massive, surprise moves: $NBY $TKAT

3830 2018-09-13 04:27:41 Well sucks for cube bc they just lost 2 sources of income + their stocks are dropping so they just played themselves. #suckstosuck
3831 2018-09-13 04:27:41 Their stocks dropped the day the photo was released.
3832 2018-09-13 04:27:34 wow, the audacity to kick them out? im sorry, I didn't know people weren't allowed to love and date each other. you lost "faith and trust" ? you don't even have a dating ban. your stocks are going down. you lost them, they surely didn't lose you <3
3833 2018-09-13 04:27:29 @cubeunited please explain your self why would you take out Edawn and Hyuna they are a big part of my life and you have killed me why them now your stocks will go lower I hope your happy.
3834 2018-09-13 04:27:28 cube's stocks are dropping like yeah fuck cube but that. still hurts the artists under them doesnt it
3835 2018-09-13 04:26:49 Cube: "We're letting go of you both"

Hyuna & E'Dawn: "Wha-"

JYP: "LETTING GO IS DAY6'S SONG TITLE. IT IS COPYRIGHT. WE'RE SUING."

Cube: *already plummeting in stocks* Shi-

JYP: *to HyunA & E'Dawn* Don't worry. We got you.
3836 2018-09-13 04:26:29 Why y’all happy about cube stocks dropping get the fuck out of here just think of how it will ruin their other artists
3837 2018-09-13 04:26:05 DUMB. why would you throw your precious gems out of your company just because they are humans that date each other like how other normal people do tsk. (Good luck w/ ur stocks then... well u still have other groups like G-idle,etc. but NAH I bet it won't be like before)
3838 2018-09-13 04:25:42 rip cube ent’s stocks
3839 2018-09-13 04:25:40 Right there should have been some kind of punishment because they were dating and trying to hide it instead of just coming out to the company and fans from the beginning but not fire them. You should check out their stocks..like big time red downward spiral!
3840 2018-09-13 04:24:32 @NorbertBodziony Woooow bro just did a quick research on those weed stocks, & your right it looks close to ripple at 3$ smhh...  Anyway any other stocks to watch out for & good youtube channel + websites for beginners to learn on stocks ?  Thanks
3841 2018-09-13 04:24:28 Cube’s stocks keep going down and down so that’s good
3842 2018-09-13 04:23:40 There's never a dull year in the Chinese market. Either stocks knock on heaven's door or they find new ways of moving closer to the earth's core. Over the last 14 calendar years, the Shanghai Composite Index has appeared nine times in either the top or bottom 10 global indices.
3843 2018-09-13 04:23:35 cube’s stocks right now is 2$...i have to laugh
3844 2018-09-13 04:23:32 When i about to start to yell "you deserve that!!" after saw how cube stocks fall, i got reminded that my 9 babies are still in that agency.
3845 2018-09-13 04:23:15 Regarde ces stocks c’est une catastrophe 
3846 2018-09-13 04:23:09 Nikes take a hikes without my feet in them..i give nike the American combat boot right up nike communist butt... Real men and women wear combat boots ... New balance stocks buy them now lets buy American made products...
3847 2018-09-13 04:23:07 Cubes stocks went down drastically its what she deserves
3848 2018-09-13 04:23:05 A hiatus yes is understandable but firing them is not only irrational but it's a terrible business decision. Their stocks are ALREADY dropping because they kicked them out. Hyuna was the main thing keeping the company afloat besides a few other groups but besides rookies the-
3849 2018-09-13 04:23:00 cube let go of edawn and hyuna because they probably thought that it'll affect them, um, letting go of them means more problems (dont mess with fans) and it probably will affect the other artists underneath their ent as well. stocks are going down, did cube think this through?
3850 2018-09-13 04:22:57 i also feel so bad for the other idols in cube and seeing how their stocks are dropping is just damn
3851 2018-09-13 04:22:48 i hope anyone with stock in cube sells all their shares tomorrow i want their stocks to fucking TANK burn in HELL CUBE i hope you go BANKRUPT
3852 2018-09-13 04:22:48 cube ent’s stocks dropped :’-((((

stan list
3853 2018-09-13 04:22:32 Pls keep me updated on cube's stocks going down i love it
3854 2018-09-13 04:21:57 okay i remember cube stocks going down when the hyuna-hyojong dating news was confirmed and now stocks are also going down after cube kicked them out. looks like cube should've listened to non-knetz too.
3855 2018-09-13 04:21:17 Looking at USDA cotton crop report what will happen when USDA takes off 600,000 bales for Texas. 500,000 for hurricane losses and if they reconcile differences with India stocks now estimated by some sources as 7 million to high.  That makes world stocks of 69, million.  Wow!

3858 2018-09-13 04:20:33 goodnight oomfs i can’t wait to see cube slowly rot and watch their stocks plummet  it’s what they deserve 
3859 2018-09-13 04:20:30 Deymmm the only group that cube is holding on in regards to their stocks is g-idle.. :/ sad.
3860 2018-09-13 04:20:18 Their relationship falsely then definitely knowing they were and cube knowing the backlash when they knew they released bullshit. Their stocks were going down but now they’re REALLY down so the general public are obviously agreeing this is wrong too.
3861 2018-09-13 04:20:09 So cube stocks are plummeting thats what they DESRVE

3862 2018-09-13 04:19:54 their stocks are dropping, they lost one of their biggest moneymakers

cube rn: oh shit we fucked up
3863 2018-09-13 04:19:49 watch cube's stocks go down because they removed hyuna
3864 2018-09-13 04:19:37 I really want to see how Cube stocks are droping rn...
3865 2018-09-13 04:19:25 cube's stocks are dropping but according to their financials they're in an ok position where this might not hurt them too bad in the short term, in the long term though who knows if they'll end up recovering
3866 2018-09-13 04:19:05 Puro sila keyboard warriors of you really feel bad then buy cube stocks enuf to reinstate them both. Actually, y are you all hatin' when you didn't buy pentagon fanmeeting tix. lol.
3867 2018-09-13 04:18:58 im ready to see cube's stocks flunk quickly
3868 2018-09-13 04:18:49 They'll be reporting hundreds of accounts rn I don't think they can. Especially when they're probably frantically calling their supporters trying to get them to keep their stocks
3869 2018-09-13 04:18:45 All of these grossly overvalued weed stocks will collapse... billions will be lost.
3870 2018-09-13 04:18:32 watch cube's stocks struggling to go up after this lmao
3871 2018-09-13 04:18:23 Wow. In all my years in the Kpop community this is by far the pettiest, cowardly move from a label company   Cant wait to see them stocks drop to hell #RememberKarmaIsABitch #CubeIsOverParty
3872 2018-09-13 04:18:21 Cube's stocks just dropped 5% LMAO KARMA IS COMING HORRES
3873 2018-09-13 04:17:59 Cube entertainment stocks is going down like crazy so #cubeiscancelled
3874 2018-09-13 04:17:52 Your observation is correct. With minimal growth, I don’t see a difference between fmcg stocks today and real estate. Companies having high growth with high PE are much much better till the time they maintain the growth rate.
3875 2018-09-13 04:17:43 cube’s stocks are decreasing...you see when you do clownery...the clownery comes back
3876 2018-09-13 04:17:41 Cube stocks are falling, and did you know who will be the one affected? Their artists. If you actually care for Pentagon, and not just Hyojong and Hyuna’s relationship, you will not celebrate this shit
3877 2018-09-13 04:17:38 They are un-stoppable now. No one would have an idea as to how many 1000 crores of stocks has been piled up for the upcoming festive season by these couple of MNCs backed players. Strike when the iron is hot to get the best results. @FEcoms_India @AIOVA3
3878 2018-09-13 04:17:15 Cube stocks dropped to 2400 KRW after hyuna announced that she and hyojong were dating. I’m interested to see if the drop this go round will be more or less severe
3879 2018-09-13 04:16:07 drop them faster than cube’s stocks after thEY FUCKING KICKED OUT HYUNA AND EDAWN
3880 2018-09-13 04:15:57 My friend used to recount his hot stocks constantly. Whenever I wanted to play too, he would stop me & say “Do your research.” I’ve never forgotten that

Need to know more about anything? Don’t rely on a few soundbites from someone with a passing interest.

Do. Your. Research.
3881 2018-09-13 04:15:41 CUBE REALLY JUST FUCKED THEMSELVES THEY ARE ALREADY DROPPING IN STOCKS 
3882 2018-09-13 04:15:38 Ha cube’s stocks have already started dropping
3883 2018-09-13 04:15:00 their stocks are dropping so fast i’m cackling
3884 2018-09-13 04:14:46 YOU GUYS!!!!! CUBES STOCKS ARE GOING DOWN RN AND THIS IS AFTER THE FACT THAT THEY JUST ANNOUNCED THEY LET GO OF HYUNA AND E’DAWN!!!  
3885 2018-09-13 04:14:25 Cube Ent making their label go down to hell even their stocks are going to hell g-idle cant save their label i love the girls but fucking dont depend on them
3886 2018-09-13 04:14:07 alexa play drop by mark because that’s exactly what’s happening to cube’s stocks #CubeIsOverParty
3887 2018-09-13 04:13:52 I'm angry and tired I'm going to bed, fuck Cube!! Hyuna, Hyojong and the other groups in CUBE (Especially Pentagon) Deserves better than this. Have fun with your stocks CUBE 
3888 2018-09-13 04:13:42 goodnight oomfies! let’s sleep well over the sound of cube’s stocks dropping
3889 2018-09-13 04:13:31 they can tell me cube made a good decision all they want but their stocks are saying something else!
3890 2018-09-13 04:13:30 i don’t have much to say about this but i hope cube’s stocks plummet but everyone continues to support pentagon. they’re a talented group and have worked way too hard for everyone to drop them for this. or i hope all of pentagon leaves and goes to a different company. yeah.
3891 2018-09-13 04:13:19 most company stocks take an immediate dip at the time of news (nike withstanding) like this, so it's better to see what happens in like a week from now for real impact. and yeah i guess they are confident in them but since edawn was a big part of one of those groups that's ???
3892 2018-09-13 04:12:50 Their stocks are about to get down bishsbdn watch cube fall down in ashes lol
3893 2018-09-13 04:12:48 stocks is performative
3894 2018-09-13 04:12:39 Ha their stocks plummeted the deserve it
3895 2018-09-13 04:12:11 a-are cube stocks actually going up?
3896 2018-09-13 04:12:07 I think he or she is heavily invested in Cannabis stocks.Just my observation duuude.
3897 2018-09-13 04:12:02 Bumaba yung stocks ng Cube Ent dahil sa pagalis nila Hyuna at E Dawn hahaha
3898 2018-09-13 04:11:31 lmao at cubes stocks crashing
3899 2018-09-13 04:11:20 Side benefit of having your phone in grayscale is the Stocks app doesn't have green or red. Less emotionally triggering when you have to actually read the plus/minus.
3900 2018-09-13 04:10:57 The way the stocks are dropping dhdjdjs i have to laugh
3901 2018-09-13 04:10:49 I dunno?

Why do I have stocks in food additives, and make up thin stories about whatever shred of decency is left remaining in my insipid, fly-brain?
3902 2018-09-13 04:10:42 im so sorry for the groups that are still under cube like they dont even deserve this ITS THE COMPANY’S FAULT their stocks are going down
3903 2018-09-13 04:10:42 Watch their stocks plumme down to the ground. They just removed their most valuable asset. Good job cube
3904 2018-09-13 04:10:40 Cube letting hyuna and edawn go is the WORST decision they've ever made. Im so done with these shitty companies  lets all watch cubes stocks plummet cause of this skdkkzkskdkzkzjjdksk
3905 2018-09-13 04:10:03 I really hope those stocks keep dropping, because that shows even Korean investors think Cube fucked up. I hate to say it, but money is what will speak to that damned mess of a company
3906 2018-09-13 04:09:55 watch cube falling their stocks 
3907 2018-09-13 04:09:45 jyp’s stocks sweeties
3908 2018-09-13 04:09:42 sooo if fans of past & current @cubeunited's artists were to buy their stocks now bec its going down real fast- that means fans can control the trash company- ie make the pr team leave, make the ceo leave, make them actually treat the artists better, no? #CubeIsOverParty
3909 2018-09-13 04:09:38 cube's stocks though 
3910 2018-09-13 04:08:20 Yea, agree with that part as to fact they took the risk. What I mean from the tweet is I guess they knew such consequence as dropping stocks etc is highly inevitable.
3911 2018-09-13 04:08:16 Cube’s stocks are going down they deserve that, but I feel bad for pentagon and clc. They deserve a better company.
3912 2018-09-13 04:08:04 So @cubeunited  how are your stocks rn? : ) it must be going downhill bcs your management team are shitheads. Y'all probably made the decision of kicking out Hyuna and Hyojong after 16 hours of no sleep and 12 cups of coffee.
3913 2018-09-13 04:07:56 You made biggest mistake Cube!!!! Im excited too see your stocks falling down !!! They just fall inlove, nothing wrong with that
3914 2018-09-13 04:07:47 Man fuck cube let your stocks drop 
#CubeisCancelled #CubeIsCancelledParty
3915 2018-09-13 04:07:42 this whole ordeal has sparked my interest in stocks
3916 2018-09-13 04:06:35 Their stocks are plummeting. They’re gonna regret it 
3917 2018-09-13 04:06:17 RATIONAL WHERE???? They literally fired their money maker have you seen their stocks
3918 2018-09-13 04:06:15 check their stocks, they gonna bankrupt soon. bullshit lah dgn carta, hyuna literally carry cube on her backs after beast left,apink left,4minute disband and now they kick her out?! okay kyra tk boleh terima ayat ayat kak ziema
3919 2018-09-13 04:06:15 @elonmusk A mate of mine, who I’ve known for about 26 years, is the biggest supporter of you and your many companies but especially @Tesla which he has stocks in. I basically want to know if you can PLEASE like this tweet so he can have his 5mins of glory? @skitzsanis
3920 2018-09-13 04:06:09 Then both markets dropped nearly 80%.. now look at stocks from those levels from last rescission.. crypto will be better if we give 8 to 9 years time..
3921 2018-09-13 04:06:06 You know what really makes me sad. CUBEs stocks will fall because of this and the other artists under CUBE might suffer bc the company might make them work harder....
3922 2018-09-13 04:06:01 Their stocks are dropping. They messed up big time.
3923 2018-09-13 04:05:45 I just checked with the SG GOM :) will be waiting for the stocks to arrive. Thank you!
3924 2018-09-13 04:05:34 the stocks are going down ctfu #CubeIsOverParty
3925 2018-09-13 04:05:33 goodnight to hyuna and edawn only i love u both and im so happy u r together and i will always support the both of u and also i hope cube can find a way to pay the rent now that their stocks have crashed lower than my depression 
3926 2018-09-13 04:05:29 Don’t cry girly, karma goes alejen. Their stocks did a big ass dropped xD
3927 2018-09-13 04:05:27 P is not.  Zoom out on the chart for long term winners. P is laying off employees.  Growth stocks don’t do that.
3928 2018-09-13 04:05:22 some people are saying that cube had to remove hyuna and e'dawn due to stocks dropping and such from their dating which is understandable BUT scandals talks don't last forever, they stay for a while and then people gradually forget them+
3929 2018-09-13 04:05:19 cube stocks are gonna drop low, why did they do that? there was no one to stop this? give it a time, i saw knetz forget so many things, this dating /scandal/ would be another one to the list...
3930 2018-09-13 04:05:00 stock money only goes directly to the company and isn’t directly showing their income it just shows how much money they get from the stock market ONLY even if they still get money from stocks it doesn’t mean that money will go to the artist cuz cube don’t care bout them
3931 2018-09-13 04:04:59 My bad. I meant assault weapons. Semi'automatic weapons are legal. However, they can be converted to automatics by their owners, using "bump stocks".
3932 2018-09-13 04:04:25 honestly?? who in CUBE exec thought this was a good idea?? for their company?? their stocks?? profit?? reputation?? whoever it was theyre fuckin PEAK boo boo the fool material now watch your company Crash And Burn
3933 2018-09-13 04:04:11 i’d love to watch cube fall into shambles too, but it’s just not the right thing to wish for, considering they have other artists under their management and they will have to suffer to bring the stocks up
3934 2018-09-13 04:03:53 As if a rookie group like (G)idle can compensate for the financial loss of kicking Hyuna out. She's worth more than her music career. Cfs, tv and live shows, her other earnings make music sales spare change. Seriously, CUBE officially killed their stocks with this news
3935 2018-09-13 04:03:37 IKR??? i mean just look at their stocks dropping now... so speechless x.x
3936 2018-09-13 04:03:32 y’all bitches ain’t understand stocks huh
3937 2018-09-13 04:03:31 Cube: What about my stocks?
Me: It goes down down baby 
#CubeIsCancelledParty #CubeisCancelled
3938 2018-09-13 04:03:29 Damn & their stocks went down by a lot smh
3939 2018-09-13 04:03:27 no solo como el hoyo, tbn tontos XDDD sus stocks se están yendo a la mierda
3940 2018-09-13 04:03:02 y’all already know cube is gonna try and come back for edawn & hyuna after they realize their stocks are depleting #cubeisoverparty #cubeiscancelledparty #justiceforedawn #justiceforhyuna
3941 2018-09-13 04:02:39 They just went underground bcs of their stocks
3942 2018-09-13 04:02:38 I have decided that this misconception of buybacks being bad comes from a fundamental misunderstanding about stock pricing. It's really very simple. If the supply of stocks outpace demand prices fall if demand outpaces supply prices rise. Buybacks reduce supply thus prices rise.
3943 2018-09-13 04:02:26 stocks already went down 5%
3944 2018-09-13 04:02:22 Their stocks are dropping like flies this is so- they played themselves they let the stupid fans win and they about to go bankrupt lmao
3945 2018-09-13 04:02:00 So it's just like any other bubble? Housing, Dot Com, Auto Mobile, even credit... I think any trend you find has a bear just waiting for it. Stocks themselves are bubbles, dude.
3946 2018-09-13 04:01:51 if cube's stocks fell after beast left i can only imagine how far it'll go now
3947 2018-09-13 04:01:41 i hope those international pentagon fans who kept supporting those goof kfans are happy now as they watch cube stocks plummet
3948 2018-09-13 04:00:16 Cube's stocks are already crashing fjdkckd but what is everyone is gonna do?? Cube might be shitty but they have soloists, they have groups, and actors, and trainees THEY'RE BEING FUCKED OVER CAUSE CUBE IS TOO DUMB TO HANDLE ANYTHING

3950 2018-09-13 04:00:09 What i find funny is that the pair have been in a relationship for the last 2 years and it has zero effect on their work abilities whatsoever, but suddenly now it does, go figure. So whiles cube stocks crash and burn at a rapid rate, i hope the 2 aritist move on to better things.
3951 2018-09-13 04:00:05 its sad how knets are probably “liking” the news. look at cube stocks, its increasing
3952 2018-09-13 04:00:03 I need more hot tips for penny stocks
3953 2018-09-13 04:00:02 Win or lose, everybody gets what they want out of the market. forex stocks
3954 2018-09-13 03:59:56 Honestly these people have no shame I'm high-key happy that cube's stocks dropped
3955 2018-09-13 03:59:54 Cube’s stocks have already gone down 4.55% lmaooooooo this is almost as good as when mannymua lost all those subscribers

3958 2018-09-13 03:59:22 i’m an SM stan so i cant rly say shit other than that this is fucking ugly and even though cube’s stocks are dropping, this is definitely not their worst during the yesr
3959 2018-09-13 03:59:05 crowdfunding to buy cube's stocks !!! pm me for deets
3960 2018-09-13 03:58:41 Your reading comprehension is as bad as your financial analysis. Unlike teslemmings, I don’t go all in on any stocks. Even frauds like $tsla and ewon. That’s dumb. As stated, I don’t care about Q3 production, so no reason to size up in front of that particular day.
3961 2018-09-13 03:58:39 Watch Cube and their stocks go down in flames
3962 2018-09-13 03:58:31 But st the end of the day guys, edawn and hyuna still are together in love and 2-braincell square entertainment is going on stocks and is regretting themselves letting them go
3963 2018-09-13 03:58:26 Cube kicking people out cause their stocks dropped...so who they firing for this decision? #CubeIsCancelledParty
3964 2018-09-13 03:58:25 oomfies can u like please stop making jokes about cube’s stocks <3 hehe it’s no laughing matter when literally their asses are on the line and pentagon has a chance at being disbanded hehe <3
3965 2018-09-13 03:58:23 Big day for a couple of my stocks tomorrow. It’s like Christmas Eve. I’m too excited to make like $10.
3966 2018-09-13 03:58:18 I have their stocks open in a tab in class they're getting annihilated
3967 2018-09-13 03:58:13 Cube made a quick decision to drop Hyuna and Hyojong now there stocks are going down.  They deadass didn’t even think about what this could do to the other groups
3968 2018-09-13 03:57:56 #CubeisCancelled lol your stocks just plummeted and I’m laughing so hard. You are DISGUSTING. Don’t say you “encourage” dating and then KICK people out of your company for dating. They have been for 2 years  lol cube ya dun goofed have fun losing stocks 
3969 2018-09-13 03:57:44 Imagine dropping a whole Queen Hyuna 

Lmaoooo and their stocks dropped 
3970 2018-09-13 03:57:36 @cubeunited I’m laughing watching your stocks plummet now that you’ve kicked out two very important people because they wanted to be open and honest with their relationship. Wanna talk about liars. You should look into getting mirrors honey.
3971 2018-09-13 03:57:29 I Take Great Pleasure Watching Your Stocks Drop. Piece Of Shit Company. Did You Ace In Fucking Up Cause You're Doing a Great Job At It Now
3972 2018-09-13 03:57:23 i just dont know why cube actually did this to them it really doesnt make sense to fuck up the dynamic of your only promoting bg and lose your biggest breadwinner at the same time.....they really thought they snapped but the stocks prove otherwise 
3973 2018-09-13 03:57:07 Gossips like #BobWoodward would be displayed in stocks, in the public square, in Puritan times.
3974 2018-09-13 03:57:07 good luck cube your stocks hit rock bottom this is the consequence
3975 2018-09-13 03:57:03 Looking at the big three stocks vs cube is funny
3976 2018-09-13 03:56:40 #CubeIsOverParty #CubeIsCancelledParty
Cube lost 4Minute but HyunA stayed and helped a lot with the stocks. And now....this? +
3977 2018-09-13 03:56:38 Cube does realise they can be potentially sued over this? Their stocks have dropped majorly and they now could have a potential lawsuit on their hands. I hope karma gets to them
3978 2018-09-13 03:56:35 Still selling stocks in India because we as fools buy it. You have already launched mi band 3 and it doesn't seem to be coming to India till you guys run out of stock with MI band 2 !
3979 2018-09-13 03:56:35 Cube’s stocks deserve this
3980 2018-09-13 03:56:34 I can't wait for Cube's stocks to go down
3981 2018-09-13 03:56:29 Cubes stocks are going down and I feel like the remaining groups are going to struggle bc of cube dumbass decision
3982 2018-09-13 03:56:18 How will the latest #iPhone fare up, most importantly will it drive #Apple stocks to a new high ?
3983 2018-09-13 03:56:09 I looked back and Cube’s stocks barely went down when the dating news first came out??? And then they climbed only to PLUMMET WITHIN 30 MINUTES???? From a money standpoint this makes NO sense #CubeIsCancelledParty
3984 2018-09-13 03:56:00 lmao how low will cube's stocks be after this, i hope it's enough for them to regret dropping queen Hyuna and E'dawn
3985 2018-09-13 03:55:55 It is so unfair. They are taking a huge hit in stocks right and honestly it's what they deserve. Hyuna is a huge loss and so is E'Dawn. Poor Pentagon. Hyuna will do fine due to her popularity but Pentagon is just...fucked.
3986 2018-09-13 03:55:50 My stocks humbled my ass quick hahahahaha I was balling for a second 
3987 2018-09-13 03:55:44 LOL sorry for laughing but, look at how cube’s stocks are dropping like *it goes down down baby~* 
3988 2018-09-13 03:55:29 stocks of Cube dropping like crazy omf
3989 2018-09-13 03:55:26 conspiracy theory cube's stocks has been dropping since 7th sept so investors maybe knew about it since then??????
3990 2018-09-13 03:55:17 why are cube’s stocks going up
3991 2018-09-13 03:55:16 I don’t trade stocks but I get your point.
3992 2018-09-13 03:55:11 It's every 10 years stock market crashes, when the new Congress impeach Donald Trump, American stock market crashes along with global markets, pence is weak and will be worst than Trump, pence will be a puppet for military industrial complex, only way to help stocks start a war
3993 2018-09-13 03:54:56 cube treated b2st dirty. cube murdered 4minute. cube destroyed a 2 year old idol’s career. cube kicked out their fucking backbone.

i rarely get angry about issues surrounding kpop, but i hope cube’s stocks drop even more. the artists remaining in the company DESERVE better too
3994 2018-09-13 03:54:51 can’t even afford to buy papers to wipe xxx in this mkt, let alone lines of stocks . Hopefully uranium becomes the shining light of resource stocks in the lead up to Santa rally
3995 2018-09-13 03:54:44 they stocks are tanking 
3996 2018-09-13 03:54:40 now speaking as an (G)I-DLE fan, just IMAGINE the amount of PRESSURE & STRESS they are receiving right now. C*BE better not be depending on them to bring their stocks up, because they are still ROOKIES and they need time to rest in between their comebacks.
3997 2018-09-13 03:54:31 CUBE STOCKS IS DROPPING LIKE CRAZY AHSKWBWKWB IT IS WHAT SHE DESERVES
3998 2018-09-13 03:54:29 Their stocks shot down
3999 2018-09-13 03:54:28 I hope their stocks go down even more.
4000 2018-09-13 03:54:23 true. bumababa daw kasi stocks kapag in a relationship yung artist. Sa part na yan, may fault ang fans din
4001 2018-09-13 03:54:19 not just that, but stocks going down mean investors pulling out from their former engagements with cube
4002 2018-09-13 03:53:54 CUBE IS FUCKING OVER I HOPE THEIR STOCKS WULD CONTINUE TO GO DOWN #CubeIsOverParty
4003 2018-09-13 03:53:48 Yeet their stocks are basically gone already you should look at #CubeIsOverParty
4004 2018-09-13 03:53:47 Cube single handily ruined their company. Their stocks are already falling and all their newly debuted groups are going to get paid dust bc the main sources of profits just got kicked out..
4005 2018-09-13 03:53:43 I see their stocks are going down fast by the minute, i smell bankruptcy. Serves you right, karma is really that b*tch

Hyuna and edawn deserves better
4006 2018-09-13 03:53:40 @cubeunited without Hyuna you guys are going bankrupt. Stocks may have gone down because of the relationship but stocks will really go down this time. Everybody say goodbye to cube
4007 2018-09-13 03:53:27 yall cubes stocks are already dropping at a rapid rate.
4008 2018-09-13 03:53:17 did you see the thread under the tweet? someone posted Cube stocks and it dropped nearly 5%
maybe AOMG can pick Hyuna up
Jay Park knows a thing or two about labels being baby bitches and they were together under JYP once upon a time ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
4009 2018-09-13 03:52:56 Time to see cube stocks GO DOWN
4010 2018-09-13 03:52:54 CUBE is gonna have to work their Asses off to make up for sales and stocks for HyunA and Edawn
4011 2018-09-13 03:52:48 May the stocks reach all time high #bazzar

4017 2018-09-13 03:52:08 cubes stocks are crashing & i should be happy but at the same time like its not the other groups in cube’s fault & i want the absolute best for pentagon but at the same like this isnt fair & hyuna and hyojung and pentagon and all the other cube artists deserve better treatment
4018 2018-09-13 03:52:05 i wouldnt say that its plunging? there are fluctuations but it looks normal? but IDK im not into stocks lol
4019 2018-09-13 03:52:00 I hope cube’s stocks go down fucking trash ass company I hate south career all they care about is money
4020 2018-09-13 03:51:22 OUR PENTAGON IS 10. BRING HYOJONG AND HYUNA BACK. They fought so hard to debut as 10, them falling in love is a GOOD THING. Ignore the jealous immature fans. Hyojong and Hyuna deserve to be happy. Right now you're losing stocks, redeem yourselves and bring them back.
4021 2018-09-13 03:51:10 Que asco ver como los stocks de Cube siguen subiendo...
4022 2018-09-13 03:50:59 please please please let cubes stocks drop so hard so they get what they deserve

4027 2018-09-13 03:50:02 can some other ent. take pentagon, (g)i-dle, clc and other cube artists so they can't be affected by cube's stupidity and stocks
4028 2018-09-13 03:50:01 @KarvyStock Most dishonest financial services firm. My father has been asking for his money for the last 1 month after they sold his stocks and yet has not gotten any response from them..Will be forced to take it to the authorities to report this fraudulent activity
4029 2018-09-13 03:49:53 they ain’t got no power and the way they stocks dropping.. I kinda happy
4030 2018-09-13 03:49:51 cube please stop. ruining your other groups comebacks that are stil under your company by ruining your own stocks at random times. im worried abt the other groups still under their name if ppl start boycotting cube itself
4031 2018-09-13 03:49:51 all these cube admins better start getting used to the taste of plain rice and salt bc rip yall stocks and sales 
4032 2018-09-13 03:49:21 Nice move Cube, as if your stocks weren’t dropping already you just dug your own grave
4033 2018-09-13 03:49:16 Their stocks crashed down so bad sjsjsjs
4034 2018-09-13 03:49:11 I hope C*BEs stocks crash and burn in hell ^- ^
4035 2018-09-13 03:49:06 also stop laughing about cubes stocks going down because that can seriously be harmful for all the other artists at cube and nobody deserves that shit so please think twice when you try to be funny on the tl
4036 2018-09-13 03:48:56 u know whats sad? the fact that cube stocks are going up after the news. this is literally unfair for all artist.
4037 2018-09-13 03:48:46 Always hated those stupid street stocks
4038 2018-09-13 03:48:43 waiting for someone to make a livestream of cube’s dropping stocks  
4039 2018-09-13 03:48:39 LISTEN HERE: WHOEVER IS BUYING STOCKS FROM CUBE , I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT NATURAL SELECTION IS COMING FOR YOU FIRST 
4040 2018-09-13 03:48:38 "Cube's stocks are falling down faster than my grade"
Hahahaha
4041 2018-09-13 03:48:36 Their stocks were dropping already but now it’s going to just plunge
4042 2018-09-13 03:48:31 I hope Hyuna and E’Dawn are having crazy hot and passionate s*x while they watch Cube’s stocks tank into the depths of hell.
4043 2018-09-13 03:48:17 cube ent stocks went really LOW lmao its what they deserve
4044 2018-09-13 03:48:16 cubes stocks plummeting .. i love this song
4045 2018-09-13 03:48:14 @cubeunited HYUNA AND E’DAWN DESERVE BETTER YALL BOUT TO BE BROKE THATS WHY YOUR STOCKS ARE GOING DOWN NOW
4046 2018-09-13 03:48:03 now cubes stocks r dropping and everyone is mad af
4047 2018-09-13 03:47:58 im about to mute everyone that keeps 'updating' on the fall of CUBES stocks bc theres still groups under them that are suffering from this
4048 2018-09-13 03:47:54 ( from a business standpoint, i do get it. after cube spoke up, the two did go behind the company's back and made them look like a fool for denying the initial statement and then their stocks took a massive dive. i get it. but tbh a longer hiatus woulda worked out than.. this.

4051 2018-09-13 03:47:00 Cube stocks are plummeting and it’s what they deserve
4052 2018-09-13 03:46:35 Doesn’t matter about charts. Without Hyuna, your group wouldn’t be here. Hyuna (and 4Minute) among with beast (who aren’t there anymore) made cube what they are today. And it’s shitty how they played them. They are even loosing stocks. Cube is done I’m sorry
4053 2018-09-13 03:46:17 Does cube understand the consequences of what they’re doing? This is gonna effect the company and the artists so negatively and many people are going to boycott have you seen the stocks
4054 2018-09-13 03:46:11 Lol They don’t have the guts to say that. They thought they can save the company by doing so, but I guess it’s not happening. Stocks are free falling lmao
4055 2018-09-13 03:46:00 cube artists are going to suffer to raise the stocks i fucking hate This

4062 2018-09-13 03:44:12 I can see Cube's stocks dropping low
4063 2018-09-13 03:43:55 IM SO MAD I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS. @/CUBE HAVE FUN HAVING YOUR STOCKS GO DOWN. They can't even protect hyuna and edawn how the hell are they gonna protect clc and pentagon and keep them afloat. Bullshit tbh, these artists deserve a better company
4064 2018-09-13 03:43:20 The stocks is going dowwwwn~
4065 2018-09-13 03:43:02 wait the stocks are actually dropping this is really concerning for other cube artists
4066 2018-09-13 03:42:56 stop making fun of cube’s stocks. it’s all fun and games until you realize that cube will literally go bankrupt and their artists will inevitably be kicked out bc of lack of financial support.
4067 2018-09-13 03:42:48 I wish invested in some stocks from cube so I could pull out now and hurt them LIKE THEY HURT ME.

4071 2018-09-13 03:42:30 cube's stocks falling THATS HOT
4072 2018-09-13 03:42:30 Cant wait to see all Cube's stocks falling. Hyuna owns Cube fyi
4073 2018-09-13 03:42:23 Cube’s stocks plummeting and people trash talking them is not even 1/4 of what they deserve.
4074 2018-09-13 03:42:15 Or how do you grow your investment if you (and your parents before you) didn't have access to education? Mani lang ba ang stocks if you can't read? 5k LANG naman? I'm glad u have 5k for your hibiscus tea but bitch some people bend over backwards just to scrape 50 pesos together
4075 2018-09-13 03:42:15 cube’s stocks is going down down baby~
4076 2018-09-13 03:42:05 Yep, and CT reacted like the sewer it is.... from Stocks low in 09 to #ltcwinter in '17: Cant argue with the facts, @jack
4077 2018-09-13 03:42:05 Hey @cubeunited May your stocks drop even more
#CubeIsOverParty
4078 2018-09-13 03:42:01 Their stocks would really go down. I feel bad for the artists who got dragged to this simply because thwy work under them. Damn, Cube you're shitty as hell
4079 2018-09-13 03:42:00 labo din kasi hyuna is their biggest star now. medyo maling business move lang, e di lalong babagsak ang stocks haha. dahil to sa mga possessive fans na naghuramentado kaloka
4080 2018-09-13 03:41:53 the cube stocks falling break my heart for the other groups under them they don’t deserve this just bc cube are childish and don’t know how to handle business
4081 2018-09-13 03:41:52 So cube let go of Hyuna and E’dawn? Watch them go to the rock bottom . #cubeiscancelledparty their stocks already fell so fast ..... (is it called stocks? Meh I don’t know business/economics stuff)
4082 2018-09-13 03:41:47 i just wanna see if cube’s stocks r gonna drop lower than sm’s did when luhan left
4083 2018-09-13 03:41:44 Ikr? You can't tell me Cube didn't know they were dating for 2 yrs, they just mad they went public with it. But they really f'kd up this one, judging by how fast those stocks are going down...
4084 2018-09-13 03:41:35 the reason why some fans are acting up and stop spending money when they find out the member is in a relationship is because companies allow that to happen. they allow delulu fans be in control. now cubes stocks are dropping every second and thats exactly what they deserve.
4085 2018-09-13 03:41:32 the stocks are dropping so fast the other artists under cube are so fucked this is bad this is really really bad
4086 2018-09-13 03:41:19 cube entertainment's stocks are going down LOL

4088 2018-09-13 03:41:15 I said for both in which bo4 has neither, show me a gun in bo4 that has recoil like the beryl and how you can make it better with attachments from a vertical grip,to different stocks, along with compensators, silencers, and flash hiders
4089 2018-09-13 03:41:03 watch cube's stocks getting buried after they dumbasses kicked out hyuna and edwan
4090 2018-09-13 03:40:58 Each player will start with a traditional 50 stocks, or 'lives',
4091 2018-09-13 03:40:49 Lol good luck to your stocks cube ent you managed to lose both BEAST and Hyuna because of your abusive antics and I can’t wait for y’all to fall
4092 2018-09-13 03:40:33 CUBES STOCKS AKLSUDFOSFIVDJFVOADFVNEKRJVNQSKDJVNASFOIVHAEIFGBAW
4093 2018-09-13 03:40:26 Kasi nga di ba, bumagsak yung stocks nila nung nabalitaan ang dating. Eh syempre, pera pera pa rin kasi nga negosyo.
4094 2018-09-13 03:40:24 i don't think dating is the only reason tbh, they probably predicted stocks fall and all of the negative effects so I don't think such small thing would lead them to that decision...
4095 2018-09-13 03:40:21 It’s so fun watching Cube’s stocks go down best thing I’ve seen in a very long time #CubeIsOverParty #cubeiscancelledparty
4096 2018-09-13 03:40:13 cube. did you wake up today thinking you would love to see your stocks drop within 10 minutes, breaking the hearts of thousands of fans, and is now considered the worst entertainment company? are you proud yet?
4097 2018-09-13 03:40:05 Cube can’t handle the issue any longer. Their stocks are dropping, concerts/show as I saw were refunded so Instead of supporting their artist, both were thrown under the bus.
4098 2018-09-13 03:39:52 watch them try to retract and try to add them back in the company after watching their stocks fall and seeing the outrage #CubeIsOverParty #CubeIsCancelled
4099 2018-09-13 03:39:50 huge ecommerce boom, i own square and etsy stocks as they are backing up the boom in smaller busnesses and start ups.
4100 2018-09-13 03:39:31 Cubes stocks come get yalls juice!
4101 2018-09-13 03:39:18 cube: our stocks going  down lmao
4102 2018-09-13 03:39:18 HAHAHAHA CUBES STOCKS ARE TANKING ATM
4103 2018-09-13 03:39:13 cube's stocks are dropping and tha/ all that matters now, next we find a company for hyojong and hyuna 
4104 2018-09-13 03:39:12 whew the rate cube stocks are dropping... i hope they can keep the lights on tonight
4105 2018-09-13 03:39:08 why are their stocks getting up tho?
4106 2018-09-13 03:39:01 Somewhat toxic for the company because of their stocks falling and other shit, they kicked her out AND THAT IS FUCKING WRONG
4107 2018-09-13 03:38:57 Cube’s stocks went down real quick.
4108 2018-09-13 03:38:51 Hyuna is basically Cube's spine. I'm sure kakarmahin sila. Their stocks are actually dropping as of this moment.
4109 2018-09-13 03:38:47 lemme see those cube stocks plummet.... cmon... LEMME SEE
4110 2018-09-13 03:38:46 Literally I'm not a fan of PENTAGON/E'Dawn/Hyuna. But it's rlly cruel to kick ur source of money,CUBE. With BTOB on hiatus as a group & just left rookies alone I dont think ur company will survive well. I know ur stocks went down but its NOT right to make tht decision
4111 2018-09-13 03:38:43 cube probably predicted stocks falling tho
4112 2018-09-13 03:38:39 $VTL in at .57 average should bounce soon looking for .70+ target. Will buy a ton @ .35 or below if that happens over the next day or so.
4113 2018-09-13 03:38:34 Cube really thought they're doing something kicking Hyuna out of the company...wait till your stocks plummet. You DON'T disrepect the queen like that. 
4114 2018-09-13 03:38:32 “I can find 10x as many "low growth" names that have had runs that produced those same gains.”
And produced them faster.  Sure. My largest gains are in stocks I’ve held long term. But the fastest gains come from breakout stocks.  Need both imo.
4115 2018-09-13 03:38:27 Yo I didn’t do any of my hw but at least I comprehensively explored the stocks app, removed red eye from every photo in my camera roll, and spent 57 mins carefully selecting my wedding dress
4116 2018-09-13 03:38:21 cube stocks rising lmao what the fuck
4117 2018-09-13 03:38:19 IM YELLING THEY'RE DROPPING IN STOCKS 30 MINUTES AFTER THEY SAID THIS 

THIS IS AMAZING
4118 2018-09-13 03:38:12 they legit kicked out the couple who give them profit.... huh,,,  watch the stocks go haywire
4119 2018-09-13 03:38:02 Cube at 1st: you can do what you want
Cube stocks or whatever going down: okay im kickin you guys out
4120 2018-09-13 03:37:59 LMAO they though it was a great idea to throw out Hyuna and Hyojong out of the company, wait until they see their stocks decreasing and ask for forgiveness, HEH bitch YOU AINT GETTING ANY ACCEPTANCE FROM THE REST OF US
4121 2018-09-13 03:37:51 cube’s stocks: we goin down streaks!
4122 2018-09-13 03:37:47 Cube you are the worst of all! Your CEO is probably so jealous of HyunA and EDawn’s relationship and had to kick them out for them to suffer! So childish of you!!! Your stocks are going down ... and will go down more!
4123 2018-09-13 03:37:47 Are we sure the stocks didn't drop BECAUSE of the dating news? And that's why they kicked them out?
4124 2018-09-13 03:37:47 there goes cube’s stocks LOL
4125 2018-09-13 03:37:41 Way to let crazy virgin knetz think they are in charge of people's lives. SMH. I'm glad their stocks are dropping now. I hope they go bankrupt without Hyuna.
4126 2018-09-13 03:37:32 Let's see cube becoming flat once the stocks drop. :>
4127 2018-09-13 03:37:27 Yall Cube's stocks just dropped 5% and if it keeps dropping which it likely will due to them losing their best selling artist then they could be bankrupt in a matter of days. They literally just hit a massive self destruct button.
4128 2018-09-13 03:37:26 their stocks are already dropping, oof.
4129 2018-09-13 03:37:21 If you don't know how stocks work, please don't comment on them and spread fake news. Yes their stocks dropped but it's not drastic (unfortunately) lol
4130 2018-09-13 03:37:20 cube entertainment stocks falling every minute
that is so sad, alexa play roll deep
4131 2018-09-13 03:37:17 cubes stocks really are dropping fuck them
4132 2018-09-13 03:37:16 Everybody celebrating cubes stocks dropping, but like yall realize there is still 9 others members ofPentagon, gidle ,clc,btob, guanlin, etc on the label. Like what, they minced meat to u?? Very rarely do labels pick up full groups. Cube gotta take care of the rest
4133 2018-09-13 03:37:14 hyuna: feet up on a diamond coffee table, a silk robe around her freshly moisturized shoulders, sipping thousand dollar champagne while she watches cube's stocks plummet
4134 2018-09-13 03:37:13 Cube were so stressed when their stocks dropped because of the dating issue. Now, I guess this time around they’ll be GOING CRAZY bc of the continuous drop of stocks after kicking hyuna and edawn out of the company, WHEN HYUNA IS ONE OF THE MAIN MONEY MAKER OF CUBE OMG 
4135 2018-09-13 03:37:10 Im just gonna sit here and watch CUBE stocks sinkining like the Titanic.
#cubeiscancelledparty
4136 2018-09-13 03:37:09 I hope their stocks drop by like 50%
4137 2018-09-13 03:37:07 LOS STOCKS SIGUEN BAJANDO, ME ENCANTA  #CubeIsOverParty
4138 2018-09-13 03:37:05 Their stocks are tanking now!  Cube Entertainment is a joke!
4139 2018-09-13 03:37:04 THEIR STOCKS SJDJJDJD
4140 2018-09-13 03:37:02 I googled Cube Entertainment stocks.
4141 2018-09-13 03:37:01 Their stocks are already plummeting. They're fucking idiots.
4142 2018-09-13 03:36:50 They’re stocks are dropping faster than their realization of what they just did
4143 2018-09-13 03:36:32 no offense but cube’s stocks are already low they stay at around $2 and dip on a regular basis lets not act like their stock value dropping $1.50 is saying something
4144 2018-09-13 03:36:31 They won't make new iPhone X but there should be ready stocks available at resellers like machines, Mac city, epicenter, switch etc. So wait la to see if they reduce price to clear stocks.
4145 2018-09-13 03:36:13 Please do NOT keep whining Dana. It's about our kids and the fact the military assault rifles belong in the military and bump stocks have only one purpose- to kill more people. Unless herds of angry deer start attacking us- ban bump stocks
4146 2018-09-13 03:36:08 if only I had stocks so I could be petty and dump them all
4147 2018-09-13 03:36:06 cube stocks are lower than my self esteem right now 
4148 2018-09-13 03:36:05 cubes stocks dropping are gonna affect the artists still under the company (LIKE PTG) and hyo literally just lost people he calls family but y’all out here making jokes?? this ain’t it.
4149 2018-09-13 03:35:56 Here I was being so happy for Pentagon’s recent popularity and even being delusional and dreaming about how I’d be able to see Pentagon as ten one day for perhaps a tour and now that dream has crumbled just like Cube’s stocks. Fuck them frfr I am truly hurt.
4150 2018-09-13 03:35:55 You can agree with their decision all you want bit the entire world knows its wrong and that's why their stocks are tanking.
4151 2018-09-13 03:35:40 its fun to watch cube's stocks drop dead to the ground :^) that's what u get for kicking out your best assets
4152 2018-09-13 03:35:33 their stocks GOING  DOWN
4153 2018-09-13 03:35:23 one last note: at least we all get to watch their stocks plummet
4154 2018-09-13 03:35:15 cube think their new groups are going to save them but they stocks say otherwise so gg to them or woteva
4155 2018-09-13 03:35:12 watch the stocks go back up
4156 2018-09-13 03:34:57 WHY DID U DO THAT TO EDAWN AND HYUNA WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU HOW DO YOU EXPECT TO MAINTAIN YOUR STOCKS WTF WTF
4157 2018-09-13 03:34:56 Cube can suck my dick. Legit killed your own company. I hope your stocks fall. I hope Pentagon goes and signs with a diff company. Goodbye. Cube is over  #Cube #edawn #hyuna #cubeiscancelledparty
4158 2018-09-13 03:34:53 The audacity of Cube removing Hyuna & Edawn in their company  now face the consequences, your stocks are going down.
4159 2018-09-13 03:34:45 their stocks are falling quicker than my grades....it’s what cube deserves
4160 2018-09-13 03:34:29 @cubeunited YO FUCKING STOCKS ARE DROPPING BITCHES CANT BELIEVE Y’ALL DECIDED TO LOSE HYUNA DAMN U GON TANK YO COMPANY
4161 2018-09-13 03:34:19 its cube buying thier own stocks at an attempt to comeback
4162 2018-09-13 03:34:17 gi-idle is doing very well right now, but cube's stocks just plummeted and it's gonna be hard to bring that back up. they're losing a lot of money and respect...
4163 2018-09-13 03:34:17 I hope cube’s stocks keep plummeting and never go back up, Hyuna was the backbone of their agency
4164 2018-09-13 03:34:12 Their stocks are going to go down 
4165 2018-09-13 03:34:01 stop celebrating about cube's stocks falling there's still groups and the other boys under them with careers too
4166 2018-09-13 03:33:59 i want to frame cubes failing stocks on my wall
4167 2018-09-13 03:33:50 So C*be would rather lose major talent and have their stocks plummet than ..what ?? What have they protected or gained from this ? 
4168 2018-09-13 03:33:45 I'd rather buy stocks
4169 2018-09-13 03:33:45 laughing at cubes stocks does not help ptg or any of their artists
4170 2018-09-13 03:33:44 fuck you cube for making me interested in stocks
4171 2018-09-13 03:33:35 Hey this news is craaaazy, but remember that 1) cube didn’t kick them out for dating (see: hui and sujin), but for going public right after cube’s denial, on sns, without talking to cube first and 2) stop bringing up stocks, yall aint economists
4172 2018-09-13 03:33:34 cube’s stocks confirm drop drop drop like grapes 
4173 2018-09-13 03:33:32 Cubes stocks dropped and we’re happy #CubeIsOverParty
4174 2018-09-13 03:33:27 i wanna be happy cube’s stocks are literally on the mud rn but then i remembered gidle, pentagon, clc and btob will prob be affected, this is a whole mess
4175 2018-09-13 03:33:25 yall karma is a quick bitch bc cube's stocks are droppinggg karma is on edawn and hyuna's side lmaosjsk i just wish all the best for the both of them bc they don't deserve this, no one deserves this.

4176 2018-09-13 03:33:24 studying these stocks to prep for the morning... something light
4177 2018-09-13 03:33:19 You do realize how now that they got rid of HyunA,their biggest source of revenue, they're gonna slowly go bankrupt right?  

I mean their stocks are already taking a huge toll since the news came out
4178 2018-09-13 03:33:13 karma, your stocks will go down, ugh
4179 2018-09-13 03:33:11 The powers that be want a war. The machine is oiled and fueled. Defense stocks are a sure thing.
4180 2018-09-13 03:33:09 im having an existential crisis. how dare they do Hyojong and Hyuna so dirty oh my gosh. the only thing fair in this situation is C*be’s stocks going down so suck it.
4181 2018-09-13 03:33:03 why is cube ent so mf trash we been knew they couldnt handle artists but kicking hyuna and edawn out is an all time DUMB bitch move???? this whole company crashing nd burning, i can alr see them overworking gidle and clc to bring the stocks back up
4182 2018-09-13 03:32:59 everyone can clown or be happy cube’s stocks now dropped but at the end of the day it’s gonna be btob that’s gonna be forced to overwork themselves to get those stocks up ugh
4183 2018-09-13 03:32:56 Let's all watch cubes stocks plummet while listening to purple on repeat #cubeiscancelledparty
4184 2018-09-13 03:32:39 I hope cube’s stocks go crashing down i hope karma hits them so hard
4185 2018-09-13 03:32:11 Go with your gut instinct. It's your body. I've twice ignored advice to have major surgery from orthopedic surgeons. The last was 27 years ago. I'm almost 70 and no regrets for walking away from the scalpel.  Like buying stocks each situation is different...
4186 2018-09-13 03:32:10 I'm still pissed. Goodnight to everyone but @cubeunited I hope your stocks are down to 0 by the time I wake up
4187 2018-09-13 03:31:51 Cube think THEYRE BEING SMART BY KICKING OUT HYUNA BUT LISTEN YALL STOCKS DROP FASTER THAN MY GPA FUCK GOING CORRUPT
4188 2018-09-13 03:31:41 wow! cube stocks have gone down so much (as they should) but I feel horrible for the other artists in the company rn
4189 2018-09-13 03:31:30 USD:CNH got pummeled today. watch the commodity space, emerging mkts and china stocks for a rebound. Gold may benefit too.
4190 2018-09-13 03:31:30 cube’s stocks: goingdown streaks
4191 2018-09-13 03:31:29 fuck cube I hope there stocks are gonna drop they really think they did something pentagon sweetie I’m so sorry I’m so mad right now why can’t idols be happy Hyuna and E’dawn don’t deserve this
4192 2018-09-13 03:31:23 Their stocks are already apparently dropping.. Im worried about the future of other artists who are with Cube as well though but #cubeiscancelledparty

4193 2018-09-13 03:31:15 Not just tea, @Coles also stocks #fairtrade-certified coffee and chocolate too!


4194 2018-09-13 03:31:13 I HOPE CUBE’S STOCKS PLUMMET TO THE FLOOR AFTER THIS MISTAKE
4195 2018-09-13 03:31:10 i just LOVE watching cube’s stocks plummet!
4196 2018-09-13 03:31:05 cube's stocks deserved it but i feel sorry for their artists :< it's like their blood, sweat and effort go into waste too
4197 2018-09-13 03:31:04 long story short, hyuna and edawn got kicked out of cube entertainment and now their stocks are declining at a really fast rate
4198 2018-09-13 03:31:03 in what way is this a rational business decision AT ALL? like hyunas been w them for so long and just bc of this they’re gonna fire her despite how essential she is to their company? and split up a group?have you seen how their stocks plummeting?? anyone could have predicted that
4199 2018-09-13 03:31:02 Hyuna and Hyojong CAN and WILL prosper without blue box tho soooo idk what Cube thought they were doing bc chileee their stocks bouta make a journey to the centre of the earth
4200 2018-09-13 03:30:54 ( rip cube stocks. )
4201 2018-09-13 03:30:51 The stocks dropping isn’t a result of Hyuna and Hyojong being kicked out! Stocks fluctuate up & down all the time, like if it was 50 points? That’d be it crashing but what we’re seeing now is just normal stock activity sorry to burst yalls bubbles I hate Cube too but this aint it
4202 2018-09-13 03:30:07 Since the stocks are plummeting can hyuna just swoop in and buy the whole joint and fire the entire board
4203 2018-09-13 03:30:04 You cost two people their jobs. Allowing obsessive fans to have a win over entitlement. Two people can fall in love. Nobody betrayed trust except you at cube. You just dropped two successful acts because they were dating. No wonder y’all aren’t big and your stocks dropping.
4204 2018-09-13 03:29:51 I love seeing a massive drop in stocks because some idiot decided to kick out someone who basically carried the whole industry on their back, so sad
4205 2018-09-13 03:29:33 while cube deserves to have their board panic with the crashing of their stocks, i take no joy fr it bcos it can mean harder times for their staff & artists. those execs could rly have timed their bullshit announcement better.
4206 2018-09-13 03:29:25 bobo ng cube ayan tuloy kinarma agad stocks are dropping and that's what matters hahaha
4207 2018-09-13 03:29:18 I feel so insanely bad for Pentagon, and all the other cube artists bc if Cube's stocks drop then the artists are gonna end up suffering the most and I just feel so upset at the way this is all being handled
4208 2018-09-13 03:29:13 cube ur just making things worse lmao ur stocks will decrease A LOT more but 
4209 2018-09-13 03:29:08 the screenshot of cube’s stocks is sending
4210 2018-09-13 03:29:08 with how cubes stocks are now, they won’t have enough money to keep there other artists up and running, especially at this rate of rapid decline ....
4211 2018-09-13 03:29:04 Cube are you so,unhappy that your stocks dropped because of the dating news? Well surely now they will plummet.
4212 2018-09-13 03:28:49 cube's stocks are dropping? good
4213 2018-09-13 03:28:42 Honestly fuck you cube y'all done finished yourselves y'alls stocks are going down and getting all this backlash is what you deserve someone save Pentagon and all the artist under this shit of a company
4214 2018-09-13 03:28:40 Oh please lord Jesus. Wow. Well at the end of the day jokes on Cube since their stocks just went way down. This is ridiculous honestly.
4215 2018-09-13 03:28:16 I heard the stocks are already going down jcsdfdhf cube is so hdkfjdhf omg
4216 2018-09-13 03:27:55 OMFG YES! I'm ready to start throwing punches. Cube is gonna crumble bc of this and all I can say is that I feel so sorry for all the other artists who are gonna be dragged into a mess of falling stocks. NO ONE DESERVED ANY OF THIS BULL
4217 2018-09-13 03:27:47 Listen i dont know anything about stocks but i know enought to see red negative numbers and laugh in the face of cube
4218 2018-09-13 03:27:40 cube's stocks are tanking right now... am i supposed to feel sorry for that bitch?
4219 2018-09-13 03:27:13 Leather Rose Gold Collection will be live on our site in another 30min!! Swipe left to see more! Limited stocks so fastest fingers first! Are you ready? 
4220 2018-09-13 03:27:03 Not only could you taken the chance at being the first company to support dating in the third gen, but also have your stocks boost by the international support. I WILL SAY THIS NOW: INTERNATIONAL FANS NEED TO HAVE A SAY IN THESE MATTERS! You’re really shooting yourself in head.
4221 2018-09-13 03:26:40 Cube is legit bs. Have fun with your inc stocks dropping bitch.
4222 2018-09-13 03:26:38 cube really ain’t shit. that they would kick out hyuna, someone who helped  get them to where they are, and e’dawn who worked so hard and is loved so much by his members shows that there is NO LOYALTY in that company. their stocks are dropping and it’s all their fault 
4223 2018-09-13 03:26:36 Watch Cube's stocks go down
4224 2018-09-13 03:26:26 Buying new iphone < investing the money in stocks  #rt #apple #stocks
4225 2018-09-13 03:26:07 @cubeunited you don't trust them? Is just a fuckin relationship!! What will you do if turns out some of your artists pregnant? You will kill em silently? The thing is, you as korean company treat your own people (fans) as some kind of delulu.. bish ur stocks is dropping! Think...
4226 2018-09-13 03:26:05 watch cube release another statement after they realize how badly their stocks are becoming 

“lol we were just kidding, they didn’t get kicked out we love hyuna and edawn!! :-) april fools!”
4227 2018-09-13 03:26:05 I hope Cube’s stocks keep plunging until they have no choice but to declare bankruptcy and/or get a new board tbqh
4228 2018-09-13 03:26:04 those stocks tho
4229 2018-09-13 03:26:03 @cubeunited 

So how does it feel kicking out 2 of ur most talented idols and watching ur stocks plummet??
4230 2018-09-13 03:26:00 someone check cube's stocks i hope they tanked
4231 2018-09-13 03:25:55 how you care more about your stocks than the artists you have known and trained for YEARS and one of them being your main money makers!!! cube showed their asses.
4232 2018-09-13 03:25:52 Their decision makes no sense because cube literally screwed themselves. Their stocks are going down so fast since news was put out
4233 2018-09-13 03:25:42 oof I can hear cube stocks falling from all the way over here. 
4234 2018-09-13 03:25:41 cube’s groups are gonna be fucked now with stocks dropping like this
4235 2018-09-13 03:25:33 Cube was actually starting to rise again this year. When the news of Hyuna and Edawn came out, their stocks suffered. I don't just blame the company but the "FANS". Hyuna carried Cube on her back after HL and 4M parted and this is how they repay her? Not to mention poor Edawn.
4236 2018-09-13 03:25:30 If you cannot accept uncertainty then stocks are not for you.
4237 2018-09-13 03:25:28 i mean it’s a win-lose situation right now

cube stocks are gonna drop record L O W without their queen

meanwhile hyuna is probably receiving love calls from every other company 

hahaha now who gets the last laugh 
4238 2018-09-13 03:25:24 rest in peace cubes stocks 
4239 2018-09-13 03:25:20 Cube Entertainment stocks are nosediving. What a dingdong mess.

4242 2018-09-13 03:24:49 hyuna is literally their biggest act if they seriously think their stocks aren't going to be affected they have another thing coming
4243 2018-09-13 03:24:47 @cubeunited I’m glad your stocks are dropping
4244 2018-09-13 03:24:46 those are the only stocks i got 
4245 2018-09-13 03:24:38 Cube’s stocks went down rip. You can’t just drop queen hyuna and not expect the consequences...
4246 2018-09-13 03:24:27 Their stocks are already plummeting and if SM could get trough baekyeon without kicking anyone out of their group they definitely could have. The easy way out is gonna come back to bite them in the ass.
4247 2018-09-13 03:24:20 cube stocks going down again lol
4248 2018-09-13 03:24:17 wheres that tweet of dean falling down the steps w the caption cubes stocks rn

4257 2018-09-13 03:23:50 looks like cube's stocks are about to fall faster than your grades ㅋㅋㅋ
4258 2018-09-13 03:23:43 LMAO THEIR STOCKS ARE DROPPING LIKE CRAAAZZYYYY

#CubeIsOverParty
4259 2018-09-13 03:23:35 cube: our stocks are shit what do we do

hyudawn: h-

cube: did u say kick out two of our most successful idols because that's what i heard
4260 2018-09-13 03:23:21 Unconscionable ... Nazi tactics.. holier than thou, above the fray.. laughing stocks... people that fall for this crap are not using their brain....think people
4261 2018-09-13 03:23:17 CUBES STOCKS KEEP GOING DOWN ITS WHAT THEY DESERVE!
4262 2018-09-13 03:23:07 Watching cubes stocks drop to hell is gonna make me giggle for days~
4263 2018-09-13 03:23:06 watch as cubes stocks Plummet
4264 2018-09-13 03:23:05 cube's stocks rn....................it's going down, im yelling timber..................
4265 2018-09-13 03:23:04 AND THAT IS HOW CUBE ENTERTAINMENT LOST ITS STOCKS
#CubeIsCancelledParty
4266 2018-09-13 03:22:58 i understand it was probably a breech of contract that killed them. but i really don’t think this went down well. cube should’ve known how negative the feedback would be considering the popularity of the couple, triple h, pentagon, and hyuna. their stocks went hella down.
4267 2018-09-13 03:22:57 Cube stocks are dropping ITS WHAT THEY DESERVE
4268 2018-09-13 03:22:56 lemme just say MINHYUN YOU CAN DATE WHOEVER U WANT IDC AS LONG AS YOURE HAPPY DUDE ;( idols are PEOPLE they shouldn’t be treated like stocks to be traded, bought & sold :\\
4269 2018-09-13 03:22:54 their stocks are already going down good fuck them
4270 2018-09-13 03:22:42 Kicking them is the stupidest decision you could have made. You've lost one of your oldest idols, damaged your own stocks and disrupted Pentagon who fought hard to be 10. You're basically letting possessive fans win also, helping no one. Them dating isn't wrong, you are.
4271 2018-09-13 03:22:38 This is so sad!!! It’s ridiculous that they force them to be around d each other how long and then when they fall in love drop them!?! I heard company stocks dropped and i hope it continues to drop. They are idols but first off they are human!
4272 2018-09-13 03:22:33 It’d be better if they left cubes stocks are dropping like crazy him being kicked out of the group is gonna hurt them so much
4273 2018-09-13 03:22:30 That would be good.  We know fuel went from $8 to $10 to $136.75 so 15X or so.  You can do a maz chart on stocks and see what they were in '05 to '08. Lots of companies today have lots of dilution since. For example, if UEC had 28 mil shs then but 156 mil today that is an issue.
4274 2018-09-13 03:22:28 The stocks were rising, they should have left them alone. Now cube will never go international
4275 2018-09-13 03:22:24 anyways cube was stupid as hell with kicking them out lmao now their stocks are gonna plummet to hell
4276 2018-09-13 03:22:15 Cube ent you absolute fucking bitches good luck getting your stocks back broke ass whores
4277 2018-09-13 03:22:12 They can't short the stocks though
4278 2018-09-13 03:22:01 Stocks are going down... I see lmao
4279 2018-09-13 03:21:52 What is our deficit I only got about $13 a week raise you are planning on cutting Medicare and social security (I just retired) the only reason the stocks are up is because of regulation cuts which is good for corporations bad for our environment how many rep get Russian rubles?
4280 2018-09-13 03:21:50 Cube stocks right now : CAUSE IM FREEEEEE, FREE FALLING 
#CubeIsOverParty Hyuna and E'dawn deserve better
4281 2018-09-13 03:21:45 cubes gonna see their stocks and come crying back to hyuna and edawn
4282 2018-09-13 03:21:44 hyuna and hyojong create a music duo and destroy Cube’s stocks challenge
4283 2018-09-13 03:21:40 lmaooooooooo imagine being the person who kicked hyuna and edawn out rn and the next second it's revealed, your stocks tank lfsldkjfdslfj
4284 2018-09-13 03:21:37 @cubeunited i just want to say that y’all are horrible and i hope stocks continue to decline.
4285 2018-09-13 03:21:34 cubes stocks were already dropping by a lot and now they just keep decreasing  I hope at least the artists in cube are going to be okay
4286 2018-09-13 03:21:33 People are celebrating cubes stocks dropping but this is. Not good for their other artists either,,, everyone suffers from this decision not just hyuna & edawn
4287 2018-09-13 03:21:33 their stocks are dropping 
4288 2018-09-13 03:21:25 I’m amused bc I know c*be’s stocks will suffer the consequences and hyuna/edawn deserves a better company anyway, but I feel bad for the idols who are still signed with them :( like they’re gonna suffer the stock plummet too, despite not participating in this dumbass decision
4289 2018-09-13 03:21:25 guess what cube. you’re fucking stocks are dropping. congratulations, you’re stupid.
4290 2018-09-13 03:21:24 Anyways cube is a piece of shit i hope their stocks continue to drop and hyuna and edawn should just make their own company they really are THE power couple
4291 2018-09-13 03:21:15 We are wrong sanzina cube's stocks literally going downhill as we speak rn LMAOOOOO
4292 2018-09-13 03:21:13 Cube Ent. can kiss all their stocks goodbye bc they’re about to hit the ground so hard #CubeIsOverParty
4293 2018-09-13 03:21:06 Sir majority of stocks down 25%. Index is manipulated with few stocks rising. Despite ATH at 11700 my portfolio down 2% down that at 10700

4295 2018-09-13 03:21:04 their stocks were dropping after the relationship was revealed, but given no time to recover, and now theyre going to plummet considering hyuna was their money maker
4296 2018-09-13 03:21:02 Their stocks drop? Good wait except for their artist, can't believe they did something like this
4297 2018-09-13 03:21:00 LOOOOOOOOOOOOOL cube’s stocks are dropping? it’s called karma arseholes
4298 2018-09-13 03:20:51 Hyuna kicked out = Stocks are going down.
4299 2018-09-13 03:20:45 cube’s stocks dropping so quick makes me happy they deserve that
4300 2018-09-13 03:20:44 let’s not pretend CUBE is concerned about “maintaining trust” more than they are about their dropping stocks. THAT’s why they’re kicking E’Dawn & HyunA put of the company. They’re blaming CUBE’s “misdemeanours” on two innocent people who’re dating.
4301 2018-09-13 03:20:16 seeing cube’s stocks drop is so satisfying
4302 2018-09-13 03:20:12 Their stocks are plummeting. It's what they deserve.
4303 2018-09-13 03:20:09 Seeing cubes stocks plummeting is so satisfying

4306 2018-09-13 03:19:27 Yes! This! 
Well, their stocks is dropping really low. I feel bad for the other artists but Cube deserves that.
4307 2018-09-13 03:19:26 Cube ent. stocks gonna fall harder than my btech grades
4308 2018-09-13 03:19:25 cube's stocks are dropping as we speak. they're over. their karma is on it's way.
4309 2018-09-13 03:19:21 this fucking sucks so badly i feel so frustrated i hope cubes stocks fucking tank or that hyuna makes her own company and buys the other groups contracts
4310 2018-09-13 03:19:19 yuki assuring me that cube's stocks are gonna crash n burn is my favorite bedtime story
4311 2018-09-13 03:19:19 Cube congrats on losing your money makers! Congrats on the low stocks! And more importantly CONGRATS TO HYUNA BECAUSE SHE GONNA BE DOIN GREAT WITHOUT CUBE. #HyunA
4312 2018-09-13 03:19:13 Cube Ent rn:

4317 2018-09-13 03:18:23 Watch cube lose stocks after they kicked their best artist aka Hyuna and one of the reason why pentagon is known aka edawn
4318 2018-09-13 03:18:22 did u see cube’s stocks drop....I’m so sorry for your loss
4319 2018-09-13 03:18:20 the only reason pentagon was picking up so much heat is because of shine which was literally e'dawn's fucking song. look at the line distribution. triple h was bringing in more recognition for pentagon, too... but cube thinks idle is gonna save their stocks lmaooo
4320 2018-09-13 03:18:19 You can’t short anything. Swiss Central Bank keeps buying stocks.

4335 2018-09-13 03:16:54 CUBE STOCKS ARE GOING DOWN

4337 2018-09-13 03:16:45 fucl cube. fuck the industry. fuck the netizens. LET THE DATING ISSUE LINGER. WE DONT FUCKING CARE. LET THE FAMS LEAVE LET YOUR STOCKS DROP. THE ISSUE WILL SUBSIDE AFTER A WHILE AND THE MONEY WILL COME BACK AGAIN. DONT FUCKING DO THIS
4338 2018-09-13 03:16:44 NOW CUBE STOCKS DROPPED!!!
4339 2018-09-13 03:16:44 Time will tell. The bottom line is USDA has no idea what domestic ending stocks will be just over a year from now.
4340 2018-09-13 03:16:43 PFFT CUBES STOCKS ARE GOING DOWN DOWN DOWN
4341 2018-09-13 03:16:38 yk what’s fucking terrifying? cube’s stocks been decreasing and now w two of their most influential artists gone, it’s gonna decrease more and they’ll go bankrupt and cube artists will need to find a new home. and it’s all because two people were fucking happy w each other.
4342 2018-09-13 03:16:36 i wonder if their stocks will drop at all like starship's since there was a big public outcry against the dating...like i know it'll be a bad decision long term, but idk about immediate financial backlash
4343 2018-09-13 03:16:35 Nidowm nag sugod ila stocks
4344 2018-09-13 03:16:35 Please stop saying their stocks dropping is a good thing  Bitch I’m pissed as fuck too but them dropping also effects the rest of pentagon, clc, and so many other great groups who deserve only the best. It’s not good at all .
4345 2018-09-13 03:16:25 Yeah it is OTL I can't believe that's such a big deal. Well Cube doesn't understand how this works, they'll see it when their stocks crash.
4346 2018-09-13 03:16:23 Hmmm so HyunA and E'Dawn were kicked out of Cube. Good luck regaining your stocks cube smh
4347 2018-09-13 03:16:21 Just watch, cube's stocks will drop and they're probably going to give everyone a hard time just to make up for their loss, especially idle (bc of their popularity rn). One day, @cubeunited , you'll realize that kicking Hyuna and E.Dawn out is a HUGE mistake.
4348 2018-09-13 03:16:16 STOCKS ARE ALREADY DROPPING WHAT DID CUBE EXPECT LETTING GO OF TWO INDIVIDUALS THAT WE ALL LOVED AND GENUINELY SUPPORTED AGAINST ALL ODDS. YALL LITERALLY HAVE THEM ACT A CERTAIN WAY FOR TRIPLE H BUT WHEN THEYRE ACTUALLY DATING YALL SUDDENLY LOSE YOUR MIND ??
4349 2018-09-13 03:16:10 it's ok. with every minute that's passed since this news, their stocks are dropping. :^) feel bad for the artists signed under them tho...
4350 2018-09-13 03:15:59 but it doesnt seem like this will do too much against cube? idk how their stocks are doing now but in the long run their outlook seems fine with both btob and gidle, and if ptg could somehow recover from this
4351 2018-09-13 03:15:58 What are they thinking???? They're stocks are already dropping!!!! How could they think this was a good decision????????
4352 2018-09-13 03:15:58 @cubeunited honestly is over now like they really messed up and they honestly can’t recover from this their stocks already took a huge plummet because they kicked Edawn and Hyuna out
4353 2018-09-13 03:15:53 Fucking hate yo dumb ass @cubeunited, watch your stocks crash and burn
4354 2018-09-13 03:15:50 No point arguing w them @supitsshekinah 

I jus sit back & watch my stocks grow #ThanksTrump. Go ahead & buy them Nikes wokies. I don't support them or Kap but betcha ima make money off that stock!

Every $ I make goes toward supporting a Republican in Nov & every Nov... 

ME 
4355 2018-09-13 03:15:42 Do you know what a 401k is?
Do you know what happens to employees from big companies when they purchase stocks of their companies. 
They make $
People who invest in the stock market usually have a diversified portfolio, meaning that the rest of their money is invested elsewhere!
4356 2018-09-13 03:15:37 Cube's stocks are about to fall faster than my grades dayummm...

4377 2018-09-13 03:13:58 people have been saying "cube is forgetting that edawn and hyuna are PEOPLE" but like of course cube knows they're human beings with emotions but they don't take that into consideration when thinking about their company reputation and stocks. business is cruel like that 
4378 2018-09-13 03:13:46 dear cube, your strategy sucks, your stocks are dropping
4379 2018-09-13 03:13:41 apple stocks rise by 69%.
4380 2018-09-13 03:13:36 honestly, cube made a BIG mistake. their stocks are going downhill.
4381 2018-09-13 03:13:34 Mood is cubes stocks dropping like 100% Sjbsjsjs
4382 2018-09-13 03:13:33 Cube is dumb as shit and clearly didn’t think of the consequences of this all and how it’ll effect EVERYONE. They just kicked one of their best sellers AND the person who helps produce so much in their company and now their stocks are dropping. But instead of being professional
4383 2018-09-13 03:13:33 CUBE'S STOCKS HAVE BEEN DOWN SINCE THAT DATING ANNOUNCEMENT
4384 2018-09-13 03:13:30 and their stocks are going down,, ugh it looks so good
4385 2018-09-13 03:13:12 HYUNA CARRIED CUBE ON HER BACK WHILE THEY'VE BEEN DORMANT (as well as BTOB) NOW THEY KICKING HER OUT???? GOOD LUCK TO THEM CAUSE THEY ABOUT TO SEE THEIR STOCKS DROP SO FAST BOIIII
4386 2018-09-13 03:13:11 the stocks dropping i should be happy cube is getting what they deserved but i’m also scared for the rest of pentagon rn
4387 2018-09-13 03:13:01 I can't wait for Cube to realize what a huge mistake they've made when their stocks hit an all time low. They're gonna crawl back and I'm gonna drop kick those bitches
4388 2018-09-13 03:12:58 well at least their stocks dropped
4389 2018-09-13 03:12:56 If cube was so worried about E’dawn and Hyuna affecting their stocks, they should’ve faked a break up between them to appease fans like what SM did with Taeyeon and Baekhyun 
4390 2018-09-13 03:12:35 cube stocks are already going down the universe is a fair place
4391 2018-09-13 03:12:34 os stocks cairam tipo 5% mano kkkkkk não foi 0.175% igual as doida do stan twt costuma printar e achar que ta lacrando foi >>>5%<<< mesmoooo

4396 2018-09-13 03:11:51 @Ask_WellsFargo when will all this fraud stop already? I'm loosing money on my Wells @WellsFargo stocks!
4397 2018-09-13 03:11:47 I’m excited to see c*be’s stocks plummet, especially after kicking out the woman who essentially gave birth to the company’s entire profits 
4398 2018-09-13 03:11:46 @LeilaGharani I watch all your videos and love them. Can you make a video in which someone can track/recall stocks on a specific date?
4399 2018-09-13 03:11:34 Buffett claimed hedge funds can not outperform stocks because of  expense ratios as high as %2 .He has been right.
4400 2018-09-13 03:11:33 hmph cube stocks are still only down 5% my guess. is by midnight it’ll be maybe 15-20%
4401 2018-09-13 03:11:20 Bruh look at their stocks rn
4402 2018-09-13 03:11:14 Background checks, waiting period after purchase, ban on bump stocks, ban in AR-15 type weapons, ability to confiscate weapons from those deemed a threat to others .  None of these would effect me or anybody I know who enjoys the rights provided by the 2nd amendment.
4403 2018-09-13 03:11:08 same but consequently their stocks tanked when them dating was announced....fucking knetz
4404 2018-09-13 03:11:03 cube stocks r sinking in real time & it's what they deserve lmfaoooo
4405 2018-09-13 03:10:57 hyuna was the backbone of cube ent and they really decided to kick her and hyojong out just because their stocks were dropping since “fans” disapproved of them being in a happy relationship lmfaoooo how fucking selfish
4406 2018-09-13 03:10:56 i wanna say i hope cube stocks go down but like that hurts their other groups that don’t deserve that backlash but fuck cube is out of their minds
4407 2018-09-13 03:10:53 This is the best way to explain. 

You buy a soda for $1.55 using your credit card. The bank pays the store $1.55. But instead of deducting $155, it deducts $2.00 (rounds to the nearest dollar) and it saved that $.45 in a piggy bank essentially and you could put it towards stocks
4408 2018-09-13 03:10:46 THEIR STOCKS ARE ALREADY GOING DOWN DID THEY EVEN THINK THIS THROUGH
4409 2018-09-13 03:10:43 $BZUN Chinese stocks took a beating last month, great reward to risk here. BZUN touching resistance, if it holds im #bullish.

4425 2018-09-13 03:09:59 i don't know what strategy cube had in mind when deciding to kick out two HUGE contributors to their company like... their stocks are already dropping and its been like 10 minutes....
4426 2018-09-13 03:09:58 Honestly same I feel bad for the artists in their company but I’m so happy their stocks are going down. I hope their artists could run away from them now
4427 2018-09-13 03:09:50 This is why fans shouldn't be given do much power. Over something as trivial as DATING too. Watch the stocks PLUMMET for Cube. Whoever started this mess, y'all better try to fix it
4428 2018-09-13 03:09:46 apparently cube stocks are going down it’s what she deserves.
4429 2018-09-13 03:09:37 I'm just waiting to see cube stocks plummeting you can't kick out your top artist like that and expect to still do well

4436 2018-09-13 03:09:20 Cube entertainment absolutely disappointed and disgusted just because of love you kick out two artist who've worked their entire teenage years and early adulthood because of stocks!!!!!
Don't deserve this sh*t

4438 2018-09-13 03:09:15 omg cube’s stocks... bye bitch
4439 2018-09-13 03:09:14 If you take something that gives someone happiness and completely ruin it and suck all the joy out of it for them then you really don’t care about anyone’s feelings but yourself
4440 2018-09-13 03:09:11 Quick, Remove all your stocks from this stupid company @cubeunited

4443 2018-09-13 03:09:04 cube’s stocks are falling LMAOO
4444 2018-09-13 03:08:52 Also, CUBE thought their stocks dropped before. Not only did they lost two really talented artists but they just upset a whole lot of people. Their backlash is probably going to be worse since they took the extreme route.
4445 2018-09-13 03:08:39 so like two of the most reputable and moneymakers of cube got kicked out bc they're in love?? they don't deserve this wtf this is gonna worsen cube's stocks but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
4446 2018-09-13 03:08:35 Maybe better to buy the shares / stocks of a company that sells Ramen
4447 2018-09-13 03:08:31 hyuna is the literal backbone of cube i hope they have fun with their stocks dropping

4456 2018-09-13 03:07:08 #HYUNA The decision was bad on Cube's behalf. They'll realize that this was a rash decision. The stocks will show.
4457 2018-09-13 03:07:02 I hope cubes stocks plummet to the ground
4458 2018-09-13 03:06:56 lmao cube's stocks are gonna go down again like the day hyojong and hyuna's relationship was exposed

4461 2018-09-13 03:06:43 I’m laughing as I’m watching Cube’s stocks drop. YOU FUCKED UP, PAY THE FUCKING CONSEQUENCES FOR THE WORST DECISION YOUVE EVER MADE
4462 2018-09-13 03:06:40 THEIR STOCKS ARE ALREADY GOING DOWN LMAOOOOOO

4465 2018-09-13 03:06:30 Buy oil. Sell Nasdaq stocks.
4466 2018-09-13 03:06:28 I can tell you from my trading experience in stocks, it's referred to as an "oversold bounce" within the bearish pattern on the daily chart. Once again the burden of proof is on the bulls to break the pattern of lower highs.
4467 2018-09-13 03:06:14 i hope cube stocks drop even worse than when the dating scandal came out . You cube employees are fucking hags

4470 2018-09-13 03:05:57 Guys, just got a call from my accountant. Turns out, you do not get to count gains on stocks where revenue growth was under 250% YoY. It's some new SEC regulation. Going to dig further into it. But it seems like I haven't made as much money trading this year as I thought. Bummer.
4471 2018-09-13 03:05:52 cubes fr over like their stocks are rapidly dropping idk what they expected by making this decision but theyre dumb as fuck

4561 2018-09-13 02:54:05 According to Manuel, the way to enrich the people (1%'s) is to foul the country's air, water, and soil.  I have a feeling that Manuel may be an old white man or woman who cares more about his/her stocks and bonds than he/she cares about the environment.

Buy stocks, cryptocurrencies, gold/silver, keep cash, etc. And diversify within each of THOSE asset classes. And then when the dust settles after a crash, buy up stocks for pennies on the dollar.
4604 2018-09-13 02:33:48 Me? I don’t trade stocks long or short. I’m just having fun. It’s hillarious watching how Musk ruined a great scam in a single ‘go private’ tweet. $TSLA

4616 2018-09-13 02:24:21 the WASDE report was bearish for corn & wheat while confirming a massive carryout of soybeans. Corn yields came in at 181.3 and soybeans were 52.8. Global wheat stocks increased as the USDA increased Russian wheat production instead of lowering it.
4617 2018-09-13 02:23:54 does anyone know a good central place to get real-time quotes on foreign indices, sectors and names? like if you were an american investor and wanted to see how foreign market, sectors and factors/names did or are doing in the overnight session every morning. #stocks $SPY
4618 2018-09-13 02:23:33 The day after he was elected stocks jumped 1.1%. Rare. Do t give me the “it was stick buy backs”. That’s crap. It was business excited about an economy with Trump as Pres. He ditched Obama regs and it continued to soar. Obama’s gains-looking at chart were dropping off.
4619 2018-09-13 02:22:42 If you’re making $ of stocks good for you, but your chime in on this thread, shows where your head is at. Pew pew
4620 2018-09-13 02:22:19 Their stocks are going up. If Dump crashes the market (a real possibility), his support will diminish considerably. It really can be that simple.
4621 2018-09-13 02:20:23 Do you go Hader here for 2 innings?
4622 2018-09-13 02:19:47 my brother is down 50% in invested stocks and hes crying he's only fourteen
4623 2018-09-13 02:19:39 Ya life is a lot harder when you dont lock up all your shares. Water seeks its own level. I would rather own $MARI than most CAD cannabis stocks.
4624 2018-09-13 02:18:20 He has been impressive since being called up from the minors...but I still hesitate to say he is back. Needs to work cleanly through more tight situations .
4625 2018-09-13 02:17:42 He means he stocks aisle 5 at the local grocery store
4626 2018-09-13 02:17:30 awesome i invested 3 stocks into him
4627 2018-09-13 02:16:35 It’s essentially a tool. You buy a candy bar for $1.65 using your card at the store. The bank send pays the $1.65 to the store and the $.35 gets stored in your acorns account. 

Then you can invest the change that’s deposited into your account into stocks
4628 2018-09-13 02:15:43 I’d like to think Ag intensification in IRL hasn’t changed the resources for bees but I suspect we’d need a lot more data to say. The timing explains the absence of Salix and Taraxacum pollen too. Anyway keep up the good work, just had a spoon of honey in my refreshed tea stocks.
4629 2018-09-13 02:14:00 Do you mean stocks on SSE? I don't have access to them. For exposure on China, I go for FTSE China A50 futures. I haven't trade that since 2015.
4630 2018-09-13 02:13:09 Tableau? Isn't that the stock that not only lost half its value in one day but took real stocks like Salesforce down with it. Rather play a game of Russian roulette
4631 2018-09-13 02:12:59 Has any ICO ever distributed the Treasury to investors when the close? 

Stocks markets are way more mature and treat investors with respect
4632 2018-09-13 02:12:36 If your 401k is vested completely in your companies stocks and bonds I’d strongly recommend diversifying your portfolio
4633 2018-09-13 02:11:54 Oufff now the gloves are coming off.... Prepare for some "consultant" exposing on these shit CSE stocks u picked tomorrow bye bye
4634 2018-09-13 02:11:27 Sure to a former MVP.

4635 2018-09-13 02:10:49 @Snapchat the reason your user engagement is going down and your stocks are plummeting is because you keep giving us terrible updates!

4639 2018-09-13 02:09:29 Profiteers are always ecstatic at news of possible war, buying the stocks of military contractors hand over fist at the smallest hint of war

4642 2018-09-13 02:08:18 Just what the tobacoo company's wanted! "Tobacco stocks surge" quote from CNBC. Losing to much money to e-cigs so they put the squeeze on the FDA to do something. As we know the tobacoo company's are so deep in the pockets of our government. Sell more cigarettes=more $ per #MSA
4643 2018-09-13 02:08:02 So many stocks surging it’s hard to pick which to play... $grat $idk $east $juju $n $huge $cxxi $pkg $fdm everyday is a juggling act trying to capitalize on profits to increase my positions. Good luck to you all :)
4644 2018-09-13 02:04:39 Whenever I meet a single man over 40, they usually find a way to start listing their assets w/in the first 5mins.

"Crazy weather today! Had to turn the wipers on my BMW, driving over here from the  big house that I own & live in all by myself. I should check my stocks."
4645 2018-09-13 02:04:35 Maybe why their stocks are going down. People don't want to retreat MSM views.
4646 2018-09-13 02:03:33 Look into battered Blue chip stocks.

4663 2018-09-13 01:55:53 Stocks are inflation protection (and I don’t mean hyper inflation). This is very under appreciated.
4664 2018-09-13 01:53:56 Very true. All o sudden all these no name weed stocks rising. Honestly many of these I never even heard of before till now. Ppl justify this and that as soon as dump comes thdn no one mentions them again except the bag holders.
4665 2018-09-13 01:52:55 Anybody at msu messed with the stock market ? Specifically penny stocks (stocks under $5/share) ?

We will know more in the next 6-12 months or so, until then these Juniors are expected to trade sideways. 2020 is the year for full boom on Lithium stocks IMO....that will be the time when every Car manufacturer will be mostly making EV's
4670 2018-09-13 01:49:28 I saw the drop below the line right at the start of the day that tipped up at just after 11:00am. Then my retail centric stocks basically went anemic at -0.8% for the rest of the day while my tech stocks climbed for the rest of the day. I thought it was retail/East and tech/West.

Thank god thought will buy some stocks before d announcement but you never “disappoint” with innovation or lack of ??
4675 2018-09-13 01:46:33 The human mind seems to focus more easily on stocks than on flows. On top of that, when we do focus on flows, we tend to focus on inflows more easily than outflows.

1 share costed less than a pair of Nike shoes when stocks dropped.

4705 2018-09-13 01:29:46 So many ppl who would never invest in stocks hold real estate "investments" because they think just because they know what a house is they understand investing in real estate (hint: the answer is real estate always goes up)

4709 2018-09-13 01:27:37 Price:  cheaper the better. I will add a small quantity at 72 or so. I usually buy in 10 chunks. So I will use the market correction to enter slowly. 2018 may provide ample opportunities to add stocks. Build a watchlist.
4710 2018-09-13 01:25:00 I was asked to prove that I was great a picking stocks so I said I already have...I picked the Apple Stock in 1980 & 2000 and used a small portion of the booty as a down payment on my home. He said prove it again. I said I already did I picked Amazon at $35 over a decade ago=Easy
4711 2018-09-13 01:24:20 I see more people are getting interested in stocks. Good, but make sure you guys know what you’re doing.

4714 2018-09-13 01:19:03 Nikkei is looking like it wants to break higher bad. I'm slowly getting bullish - I was very bearish on all stocks. Plus a friend who works in I.T. called me a month ago and said get out of stocks because an interview he saw - hmmm
4715 2018-09-13 01:18:28 No, I meant you're trading stocks like we all do and when you make money, someone else lose money. 
4716 2018-09-13 01:18:14 No you can’t get one because you’re not funny. In fact you’re terrible but keep trying.

4721 2018-09-13 01:15:40 Investing hack: if enough insurance capital is destroyed, and if the stocks are hit, good buying opportunity because pricing improves.
4722 2018-09-13 01:15:03 True - but $TLRY stock’s performance is unprecedented compared to major MJ stocks - One of the best returns when compared to my major MJ investments and in least amount of time post ipo. 

Though I still get tad nervous swinging it in my trading accounts for me $TLRY rocks 
4723 2018-09-13 01:14:26 Hahaha... if you take a look around, the opposite is happening under Republican control. Stocks are rising, unemployment down, GDP up, NK not testing nukes... Liberals are fighting daily to end it all to blame it on the republicans... #sad
4724 2018-09-13 01:14:21 The economy that Obama brought from a recession to this "booming" economy? Stocks were setting records under Obama, unemployment was lowered 6 points and job creation was high and consistent. This isn't an opinion.This is a verifiable fact. You don't even have a legit argument.
4725 2018-09-13 01:14:08 The danger with buying dips are that it's almost all leveraged, that's 80% LVR = 5x. People must surely realise the risk? It's not even like stocks where a margin call means losing one's shirt. Aussie home loans are recourse, so property margin calls extend far beyond one's shirt

4731 2018-09-13 01:10:26 If u think this is manipulation you should see stocks, bonds, gold and silver markets. Big banks biz model is mainly fraud and scams

4733 2018-09-13 01:07:47 I'm not afraid.  I am learning and can't afford those expensive ones.  So far, i notice it is easier to trade higher priced stocks.  They seem to have a certain level of controlled and paced behavior
4734 2018-09-13 01:07:25 Cognitive dissonance or temporary euphoria?

It’s really weird seeing economic confidence & business conference near record levels (along with PMI) while everyone seems to think stocks are peaking and ready to roll over...

4739 2018-09-13 01:01:16 @goldenjackass Love what you do thank you. Do you think most of the un-FANG stocks taking approx a 30% haircut is a real world effect of currency losing its value?
4740 2018-09-13 01:00:52 Also MAYBE Vanguard is done liquidating the mining stocks in their metals and mining fund, in which they’re moving the investment objective away from metals and mining.

4746 2018-09-13 00:57:02 No. The FDA said they would crack down on ecigs. Which would limit th vape industry and tobacco stocks soar. How do you come to conclusion about nicotine? It’s because vaping is crushing cigarette sales. And if FDA cracks down on vape, cigarettes sales will go up

4748 2018-09-13 00:55:45 Considering most middle class people don’t have 401k right now that doesn’t seem like a reasonable excuse to allow for inflation. Even if that were true, once the economy overheats from the expansion, those stocks will fall...like they did in 2008.
4749 2018-09-13 00:54:01 I am so tired of looking at the Canadian stock market and we are all about pot stocks....really?

4756 2018-09-13 00:47:45 I know you are talking about the phones but I will be getting my 85 year old Mom the new watch mostly for the ekg monitor and I really like that if she falls, which she has a couple times this year,  it will call an emergency number..
4757 2018-09-13 00:47:29 Did you and your wife purchase stocks in the recent insider trading scandal with the money you gifted yourself with the first tax cut? Thanks for making my health insurance unaffordable, plus gas and food are rising. Can't wait till you are out of my life.

4761 2018-09-13 00:43:56 Every year people say “the shitty sector stocks won’t run, this year only fundamentals will lead the pack blah blah” and every year the garbage still runs. Why? Because people still buy the garbage stocks and continue getting lured into them. Human behaviour doesn’t change.

“We only sold four copies. ”
4772 2018-09-13 00:35:49 So Elon Musk spoke about a lot of cool stuff in his podcast with Joe Rogan and all twitter can talk about is him smoking weed and Tesla stocks crashing? People are dumb man
4773 2018-09-13 00:34:27 Never understood how black people scared to invest but give 10% to church every Sunday..which is 4 times a month or 48 times a year but scared to buy stocks..
4774 2018-09-13 00:34:25 - Having to check notes, keep up on things like stocks (if you are into trading and such) and other things you would need for buisness or if you just use your phone to keep up with your day to day busy life. all while retaining the decent everyday average features.

4779 2018-09-13 00:30:11 That's called projection, dear. Or you have a business benefitting from his illegal Presidency like Big Oil, Big Ag, Big Pharma. What kind of stocks do you own?
4780 2018-09-13 00:29:40 Your success has caused tobacco stocks to soar.  You are happy with that?  I am not.
4781 2018-09-13 00:29:27 Guess who stocks just went up ITS LITTTTTTTT
4782 2018-09-13 00:28:43 I would call the “Social Democrats” of today both ignorant of history, and confused as to what they are. Economic Democracy is closer to how they want companies to govern themselves; but Capitalism fused into it would allow for non-voting bond investment instruments, not stocks.
4783 2018-09-13 00:28:13 Is it possible to get this info for stocks trading on CSE?

4791 2018-09-13 00:22:53 Dude this is the same thing that I was showing @bombayquant  just a few mins ago. I wonder why have other marijuana selling companies stocks not risen this much...
4792 2018-09-13 00:21:59 I believe this is the smartest bull market ever.

The stocks you think would be associated with mania are getting put on blast. And when they spike, they live short lives. Remember Bitcoin stocks? Pot stocks are probably next.

Meanwhile, the market does not care. Pure DGAF.

(意訳)
The naming XS is simple, but because of ridiculous advertising,I don’t feel like purchasing. Maybe apple’s stocks are occupied by 7&P.
4797 2018-09-13 00:19:42 Look for whatever pockets of opportunity present and trade them. A couple stocks were green on 9/12/01
4798 2018-09-13 00:19:17 It is not about stocks. It is about need. We do not need to kill whales. we should respect them.

4802 2018-09-13 00:16:54 I am a regular guy managing my own money and my goal is to outperform the benchmark - high-growth stocks, esp small cap,  are too risky in my experience, contradicting many people I follow, who I respect and see succeed daily - I am sure it is my perspective - I enjoy your posts

4804 2018-09-13 00:16:02 That 'young people', 'teenagers', 'kids' part was the tell for me there. 

Young people = people up to the age of 25
Teenagers = people up to the age of 20
Kids = won't somebody think of the children

He's such a scumbag. But his tobacco stocks have soared.
4805 2018-09-13 00:15:51 Its hilarious that Twitter is blocking republicans from showing up. How funny. Keep it up Twitter. Keep watching your stocks plummet. Its biblical

4808 2018-09-13 00:12:50 Not excusing any actions by any means  but, It looks like stocks literally 80% of nights Thurs-Saturday. I’m sure overserving and overcrowding of that establishment has no correlation right?

4810 2018-09-13 00:12:41 if you think about it the grand exchange in runescape brought me to this moment where i'm interested in stocks
4811 2018-09-13 00:12:34 The more $FB $TWTR $GOOGL get involved in politics and stopping free speech the worse the stocks get. Just an observation.
4812 2018-09-13 00:11:55 Haha, for entertainment? You're not into stocks, right?
4813 2018-09-13 00:09:07 Agree WRT bump stocks but, they’re mostly unnecessary to perform that function. A belt loop does just as well. 

Straw purchases are already illegal. 

Background checks are already required except for private sales which would be completely unenforceable
4814 2018-09-13 00:09:03 Lots of news orgs seem to be running nearly identical "crypto crash worse than dot come crash" stories. 

One was a large variety of stocks widely held that lost $5 Trillion in valuation, and the other is a small variety of currencies that have lost what? $100-200 Billion?
4815 2018-09-13 00:08:20 Magkano na ba ang hibiscus tea?
