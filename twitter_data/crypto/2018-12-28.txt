1 2018-12-28 23:59:08 To all the idiots saying $ICX or $DBC

Atleast you can average down!

For me? It was $MEC & $BDL

Never buy a shitcoin SMFH

Cryptonex $CNX -2.2% 
TenX $PAY -2.11%

3 2018-12-28 23:58:08 Don’t do that Chucky it’s cheap and nasty. Reminds me of that Tron guy. 

Everyone hanging on “moon” announcements, then nothing. 

Its everywhere in Crypto, everyone is sick of announcement announcements like this. 

Don’t play the people!

5 2018-12-28 23:57:59 Big Teds showing love as always. Happy Holidays my guy, wishing you the best.

We’re gonna kill 2019 
6 2018-12-28 23:57:44 I'd say 1000 within 5 yrs isn't too far of a stretch and 400 over the next couple years seems doable for ltc. No one knows how crypto will handle a global economic slow down if we get there in the near future
7 2018-12-28 23:57:31 Takeaway from @hashbreaker and @hyperelliptic's talk at #35C3: invest into quantum cyber ai crypto currencies

11 2018-12-28 23:56:50 only very slightly, but quickest way to get into crypto in my opinion
12 2018-12-28 23:56:49 Finally, I have have muted everything with crypto currency or block chain

Thanks!
13 2018-12-28 23:56:46 hahah
14 2018-12-28 23:56:40 Electrum BTC wallet was targeted by a phishing attack. Some people, unfortunately, fell for it. This isn't the issue of whether crypto is safe, this is about uninformed and gullible users. The same thing happens with PayPal or your bank's online banking.
15 2018-12-28 23:55:54 She says she "Lives, breathes and thinks crypto" but all she can do is attack another thinker. One that for many years has provided great insights. Blocked.
16 2018-12-28 23:55:24 I retired of my investments in crypto gues what I’m very successful, I sold my 40k xrp when at 3.30 then bought back when at 0.49 did the same with few others so do maths
17 2018-12-30 23:59:59 God I wish this was true... Haven't heard from many of them lately tho

22 2018-12-30 23:58:59 2. If there is ever another financial crisis, which might be inevitable at this point, we might start seeing the closure of many small banks and FIs. If that happens then only the largest banks on this planet will survive.
23 2018-12-30 23:58:53 Lol
24 2018-12-30 23:58:50 Yeah if you could put @quant_network on @get_delta #DeltaDirect that would be great thanks. $qnt

26 2018-12-30 23:58:32 Take all your crypto off the exchanges @digitalassetbuy says it in his Saturday video.  Something is going on with the exchanges
27 2018-12-30 23:58:23 A quick theory
1. I do believe it’s going to require more than just a couple of whales moving money around. If xRapid is indeed “live,” then It is just a matter of time before we see it truly in affect. $XRP transactions would potentially be forever ongoing as it grows.
28 2018-12-30 23:57:47 That it was
29 2018-12-30 23:57:44 amazon and apple are companies - bitcoin (and crypto) is more like financial and technological revolution, comparing to stocks is pointless
30 2018-12-30 23:56:36 U mean shitcoin?

32 2018-12-30 23:56:11 it mean that the Crypto word is highly manipulated, i belive that only 1 or 2 entities decide where the prize will go. Remember that Soros have so much power to ruined in the past, the economy of Italy and Uk
33 2018-12-30 23:56:10 SHA256 is not going to be broken by Moore’s law computational improvements in our lifetimes. If it’s going to get broken, it’ll be by some breakthrough cracking method. #bitcoin #BTC #blockchain #crypto

48 2018-12-29 23:57:33 Another good question (since we are into questioning) would be, why isn't ripple, a private owned company, with board members, ceo,cfo,employees so on, is traded as crypto currency and not as a company stock?

73 2018-12-29 23:56:46 what is more hilarious to watch is all the ta experts on twitter who shit their pants after ETH spike
74 2018-12-29 23:56:44 does uphold actually hold all the crypto retailers buy on your site, encase everyone wanted to withdraw their bags, is it all actually sitting there
75 2018-12-29 23:56:34 Wow!!
76 2018-12-29 23:56:30 a low budget AI with a bunch of accts could repost the same shit  for every short term BTC move up/down repeatedly and it would be indistinguishable from actual crypto Twitter. Wait a minute... 
77 2018-12-29 23:56:08 Don’t wanna alienate non crypto folks. Want it to feel familiar as possible. It’s working.
78 2018-12-29 23:56:03 Currently, no. However, some Dr. offer 5% discounts if paid in full...some may negotiate to have the 5% returned after payment clears. Not sure if that is legal.
79 2018-12-29 23:56:01 これは致命的なバグ
80 2018-12-29 23:55:22 This is the most popular crypto resource. I recommend everyone to read the ANN and WP of the ZeosX project.
81 2018-12-29 23:55:15 There is life out there. You should try it!
82 2018-12-29 23:55:03 Yes, Methy-Princess Mossy-Oak is bad, but I think the smug tv racism is waaaay worse because it’s crypto dog whistle bullshit broadcast widely.
83 2018-12-29 23:54:58 @mappopk_crypto I'm glad that the restriction of the account has been removed, so I think the twitter account is restricted.
84 2018-12-29 23:54:52 International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde,has said "it's inevitable" that cryptocurrencies will come under govt regulation. And the Securities Exchange Commission and the FBI, this past December, began to crack down on shady practices associated with crypto fund-raising

86 2018-12-29 23:54:30 @cz_binance hi why cant i get my crypto out of your exchange?
87 2018-12-29 23:54:29 When you play like you're hard but bruise like a peach.

Man up shilly. 
Your charitable heart shouldn't care about what others think.
88 2018-12-29 23:54:27 Obelisk SC1 maybe?
89 2018-12-29 23:54:26 BTCショート利確。
