48 2018-01-09 21:37:59 A. As I don't agree overall with any of the political teams, I follow people with a somewhat broad range of ideals. There's one I'd align with more than most, but I think we don't wholly agree on which things in life are meant to be commodities.
49 2018-01-09 21:35:44 As a trader of commodities we speculate, we watch for imbalances, there is music in a market a peace i have watching prices rise and fall seemingly randomly but emotionally steady
50 2018-01-09 21:33:27 Starting to shy away from those plays and move to commodities base plays and larger stocks. Headaches from those suck plus the mental capital from trying to find shares to short is enough to make me drink at 10am
51 2018-01-09 21:27:49 In Somaliland the ratio of tax to GDP averages about 5% compared to 18% in the Sab-Saharan Africa which means we need to improve our revenue mobilisation. However we have to avoid taxing food & essential commodities instead Khat, cigarettes & luxury items could be taxed more.
52 2018-01-09 21:07:15 One great feature would be possibility to add some percentage or fixed extra value to each unit on commodities. Like this physical coins in portfolio could represent actual value, because value of physical coins is usually way over spot price.
53 2018-01-09 21:06:35 3. Just b/c CFTC wants it to be a commodity, doesn't make it such.
I've never seen a commodity with an artificial fixed supply.
Commodities are raw materials, not man-made things.
If one supplier reduces the output of pork bellies, others will increase the production.
54 2018-01-09 21:00:34 Alot of good movement on the commodities today. Nice to see Oil and Nat gas breakout!!!
55 2018-01-09 20:58:04 Popular narrative that inflation pressures building & commodities poised for significant move. Oil is big reason for temporary inflation uptick & oil is topping here as is copper. USD has little upside here & big downside to 86, probably in the 1st half.

61 2018-01-09 20:35:42 The drop in bond prices today was shockingly bearish. I still view bonds as a bubble of historical proportions. And lower bonds n higher rates is bearish all markets including stocks. But mostly commodities!

67 2018-01-09 19:47:35 The core issue is the commoditization of the child via IVF contracts: treating children as commodities to be gained, edited, sold, discarded. 

As I'm sure you can tell, I also think about this constantly, especially as 1/2 of a couple facing infertility.
68 2018-01-09 19:44:51 If one of the parents doesn't want to parent & wants to dispose of the child, that seems reason enough to terminate the parental rights of that parent and allow the other parent full custody. Seems fairly common sense.

The issue: IVF contracts treat children as commodities.

70 2018-01-09 19:42:03 Wash trading isn't illegal on crypto. Sugar and other commodities are under different classifications and laws. Sadly, there is no law or statute that you can point to that states that crypto falls in the same categories, it is legal... for now.
71 2018-01-09 19:28:32 I disagree. Inflationary pressures building. $USD might go mid-90s here but will end in low to mid-80s by end of year as commodities breakout to new highs.
72 2018-01-09 19:16:59 End your addiction to drugs by refusing to be a puppet, a social plant, a weed suckling on commodities that destroy your consciousness.
73 2018-01-09 19:16:32 maybe- hear me out here- *maybe* we shouldn't allot the necessary resources to sustain life based on something as arbitrary as 'earning potential'. maybe human beings should be more than commodities to create profit for the wealthy class

79 2018-01-09 18:51:27 I am for some sort of demand and supply action but how can people be so indignant and upset with anybody making money. Why so terrible to make money using real estate but totally ok in tech stocks or commodities?

83 2018-01-09 18:42:40 Commodities are topping out here. Likely won't see higher highs this year. I see oil falling to $10, nat gas to $1 & copper to $1. Deflationary downturn coming & will be steep, swift & extremely painful. Precious metals a different story. They should resume rally shortly.
84 2018-01-09 18:37:09 It might require us not viewing all transactions as “market” transactions and thus not viewing human beings as commodities.

88 2018-01-09 18:11:41 I agree. The culture within Hollywood is toxic, that is if you're a woman. Women are treated like cheap commodities. On a wider scale, how do we ingrain respect for women for being humans and not objects of sexual gratification?

95 2018-01-09 17:47:07 Agreed. Not that I've disliked the Bears recent drafting, but at some point this team needs some proven commodities over projects and some star power. Roquan fills both
96 2018-01-09 17:46:25 and marketable? Which means that u can make the observation that the market is also “racist” as they favor the consumption of commodities only suited and therefore created for white abled bodies?
97 2018-01-09 17:43:59 The gvt looks at all fast selling commodities and tax. To them its easy money. They don't even do swot analysis!
98 2018-01-09 17:37:27 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
99 2018-01-09 17:35:53 Indeed! MU may go higher another day, but their cyclical risk is signifcant, as  your insightfully posted. Clearly NVDA is so much supperior with unique technology that is the opposite of commodities. What you think of #AQ? Down today, but their technology seems unique too.

101 2018-01-09 17:31:17 In India we have two types of commodities / appliances etc. we ask the shopkeeper always, whether the good he is selling is ‘chinese’ or Original. So get the point, this is your technology, dumping substandard products all over the world
102 2018-01-09 17:28:35 ok..so ignore them if you wish.. what you want me to tell you..  and you can't compare SPX to commodities...
103 2018-01-09 17:25:20 Food, drugs, and booze are probably the best and most valuable commodities. All three combined need a special name.
104 2018-01-09 17:16:15 Going outside my comfort zone with my usual commodities play and getting into some $MGTI. Much riskier imo, but higher yield possible, I don't care about the company at all, I am swinging this. No emotions, just price.

106 2018-01-09 17:12:28 Your correct but take a look at our clothing, furniture etc and then compare it to what we earn and what we are willing to spend on education and health. Please note my ultimate view on #Education and #Health is that they are not commodities and so should be FREE!

111 2018-01-09 16:42:10 Roger, no governo Lula houve uma conjunção de fatores q fez os cofres públicos transbordarem, entre elas os altos preços das commodities. O lula trocou uma dívida externa de 4% a.a. por uma dívida de 12%a.a, q porra de Adm. Espetacular é esse que triplica a dívida brasileira?
112 2018-01-09 16:38:59 @VelshiRuhle Note: since 2007 US is LARGEST IMPORTER of food in world.

Ethanol corn & GMO soybeans & alfalfa does not feed humans!

125 2018-01-09 15:49:41 Does anyone have access to a body of documents regarding corporate restriction of employees from purchasing commodities or other intangible assets? @CryptoBully @cryptodemedici Sorry for tagging, but this of grave importance to US citizens.
126 2018-01-09 15:47:35 Well he did give us the privledge to vote for a like really, smart guy..a genious who supports the bankruptcy farmers will face when the commodities markets dive with negotiated exports going away. But he be a genious in the ways of bankruptcy.

129 2018-01-09 15:37:49 Dysfunctional Governments

Countrywide power blackout - Kenya.

Countrywide fuel shortage - Nigeria

Despite those countries having enough resources to supply the commodities.
130 2018-01-09 15:32:04 You see people as commodities who you can get something of value from and enter into a bartering relship with them. This is capitalism, but it is not love. Recognising that u and the other are one and acting from that consciousness is love.
131 2018-01-09 15:30:29 My contention is that Yelich is a fine player, but 1) I can’t justify trading young, cost controlled commodities for a player that I don’t believe has star potential.  2) Wouldn’t you rather use said commodities to improve the pitching staff?

133 2018-01-09 15:27:14 It's a shame that you're in the 2019 elections campaign mode when your country men and women are slave trade commodities in Libya. They left Nigeria in droves because of unemployment and hopelessness. The lucky ones are returning home to the same jobless environment.

135 2018-01-09 15:20:31 No argument there. Only question is whether it triggers big inflation as you predict. Ultimately, the long-term ratios of equity prices and commodities prices (like 1929 and 1999) do argue for a massive relative reset. Timing/trajectory are the only uncertainties.
136 2018-01-09 15:16:16 This often results in buying the worse performing commodities and selling the high performers. Some commodities may see a short term bounce or drop but without fundamental support any correction will be short lived.

144 2018-01-09 14:37:12 American farm subsidies are egregiously expensive, harvesting $20 billion a year from taxpayers' pockets. Most of the money goes to big, rich farmers producing staple commodities such as corn and soyabeans in states such as Iowa.
145 2018-01-09 14:34:26 EM still best place for money, international and large cap growth with lots of international exposure will out perform as well. We are late cycle, commodities and oil strong too. Boom is underway, cover of time mag soon. S&p 3000 by mid year...maybe May!

147 2018-01-09 14:26:44 @ProfOsinbajo Ur excellency sir, now that our reserve is increasing can we look at our  exchange rate. Official & parallel rate of N306 & N365 to $1 is high. The rate should be reviewed to around N250 per $  so that we can see a significant drop in prices of commodities.
148 2018-01-09 14:25:31 "people against train law going gaga over 1% increase in commodities for a hefty increase in take home pay". as if namang hindi yan mag compound increase. tataas ang gas, hindi tataas ang bilihin? hindi tataas ang pamasahe?

165 2018-01-09 13:22:53 So Trump says he wants to help farmers out while simultaneously bragging about the stock market. Hey bro, the stock market and commodities market work opposite of each other. $3.50 corn won't work with current input costs.
166 2018-01-09 13:22:20 agree.but even w/o the TRAIN,basic commodities prices are on constant move,frequently going up
167 2018-01-09 13:20:49 Higher prices of commodities. Higher SSS contributions. Higher rates for electric and water bill. The govt aims to earn more at our expense.
168 2018-01-09 13:16:31 They don’t pay income taxes; but they pay VAT when they spend on taxable goods. Prime/basic commodities are VAT-exempt. 

But tax revenues are used by govt to provide poor with free education and hospitalization. There is also CCT and other subsidies.

173 2018-01-09 13:03:57 Please try targeting the fuel prices try to cut it down and the prices of commodities would surely follow. Never mind the sweets it's better to make it harder to have and minimize consumption for health reasons.

190 2018-01-09 11:12:32 Mr President sir, can you start by attending to the basics of life. Basic commodities are not affordable? There is no money in the bank. Thank you.
191 2018-01-09 11:02:52 Yes, certainly that, too.

We assume we know celebrities and can judge their character: these are marketable commodities. These are not our friends. They are not just like us, nor should we give a sweet fuck either way.

234 2018-01-09 06:04:25 apparently, according to this report, cigarettes and soda drinks are commodities needed by the people in their everyday living. You visited Puregold and you only checked the prices of these two? Nice spin! #Tatak_cRappler

243 2018-01-09 05:17:46 The intrinsic properties of a commodity determine its success becoming a UOA. A convention has to take place, but only occurs and sustains around commodities with the right properties.

251 2018-01-09 04:27:02 Really? Subsidy is a way by which sovereign powers influence the market prices of strategic commodities. Not every nation state is equally endowed with all kind of resources and development priorities. Taxation & Subsidies are two duly accepted instruments.

253 2018-01-09 04:15:11 I do. There is a whole class of Marxist economists (Gruber, Emanuel) who view Doctors as widgets and cogs. To them, we are the problem and not relevant to any fix. We must be controlled and viewed was any commodities, expendable are we.
