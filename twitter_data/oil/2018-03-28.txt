43 2018-03-28 23:57:15 Can give it a gentle soothing rub with baby oil...
44 2018-03-28 23:57:00 Like right now the arch conservatives in Oklahoma are passing taxes on oil to pay teachers based on the threat of a strike. That’s huge

47 2018-03-28 23:56:47 Hey Tina!  Not sure if this helps but, I was told that adrenal fatigue is quite common, especially for those under a lot of stress and to rub a good quality Nutmeg oil over the adrenal glands.  I started doing this and have been able to get off my anxiety meds.

52 2018-03-28 23:55:35 i recommend an oil to start with - rosehip oil is moisturizing and calming, and you can also try vitamin c for moisturizing + brightening. look at products from The Ordinary! try not to use things with alcohol in them
53 2018-03-28 23:55:35 If we only go with current oil pricing at say $70 Brent, Saudi is looking at a 15 year ROI on that $200B solar investment by just selling that extra half million barrels per day. I know it’s not the best way to calculate a return, but that’s what I would do. Export as is/refine.
54 2018-03-28 23:55:23 I had to keep adding my spinach and sliced grape tomatoes in olive oil, butter, lemon zest, pepper blend, lemon juice, garlic salt and red pepper flakes to my shrimp linguini because it's just so good.....

61 2018-03-28 23:54:25 Borrowing an amount equivalent to our oil earnings in a year is controversial. About $40m total for offices plus resort for staff, $24m to restore a mine. And why is GNPC procuring vessels for the Navy?
62 2018-03-28 23:54:09 What’s the difference between someone involved in the oil and gas industry and any highly lucrative/creative person in L.A., San Fran, or NYC that fly back and forth between coasts like 20 times a year?   #plzenlightenme

72 2018-03-28 23:52:23 @TommysSuperfood should I add oil when cooking the sweet potatoes in the microwave oven? I tried without and they were still frozen :( they didn't cook through on the stovetop either  (following instructions)
73 2018-03-28 23:52:16 Same and I tried putting some peppermint or lavender oil under a corner of my pillow case it's quite soothing!
74 2018-03-28 23:52:14 "He looked-up Tea Tree Oil."  Yeah it's great stuff.  You should buy a bottle and stick it up your ass.  
75 2018-03-28 23:52:07 コンパクトだし買ってみようかしら！
76 2018-03-28 23:51:35 But first thing first
A new way of checking your oil

Burn the oil slow if brown smoke comes up it's good
The gasoline should fall the the bottom black stuff up top

Burning the oil slow
If white or black smoke no good

Or smell it get high good
Smell it make you sick no good

86 2018-03-28 23:50:28 A National Oil Company trying to procure a new office to enable them expand is not out of the ordinary given that they have been making this request since 2011.
87 2018-03-28 23:50:26 This analogy you're giving is bogus to the argument, but I'll play along. This is like going to a mechanic shop with blown head gaskets, yet you're claiming you jus need an oil change. You argue him up and down saying this is the issue, when clearly tells you no it's not.
88 2018-03-28 23:50:24 Don't let your hair get into your face while you sleep. The oil from your hair can cause acne.
89 2018-03-28 23:50:10 I think one of the major causes of slowed economic growth was increase in oil prices(biggest expense of India). I still believe manufacturing is not the best way forward for India. China has cornered the market for high tech manufacturing. Also bring lower paying jobs.

141 2018-03-28 23:43:27 I mean it probably had oil in it. Which is a kind of fat and could be used for deep frying.

So, um, think of it as kind of a different way of deep frying some greens?

143 2018-03-28 23:43:17 What to use in Lieu of Pesticides? Neem Oil, Garlic & Clove Oil, Azatrol, StrawFlower Extract... the list goes on!

145 2018-03-28 23:43:12 "There was not one shred of evidence that oil and gas drilling was systematically contaminating groundwater; in fact, there was plenty of proof that it wasn’t."

...sums up the "green" movt's repetition of memes until the dogma cannot be questioned even by ample evidence.

148 2018-03-28 23:42:26 Believe me.... Greater Israel is their goal because they want the oil in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Syria and Jordan. They are already encroaching on Syria and seized their oil fields in the western half with the help of U.S. troops.

155 2018-03-28 23:41:20 Finally Laura comes through with the hard hitting journalism! Can’t wait till the follow up piece on how he doesn’t change his cars oil on his own and has the audacity to eat cereal after breakfast.
156 2018-03-28 23:41:14 (2/3) A popular sauce called moretum, which was made by crushing #basil, #cheese, salt, and olive oil in a #mortar, was often spread on bread. Moretum is believed to be a precursor to modern day #pesto, which was developed at the beginning of the 19th century in Genoa.
157 2018-03-28 23:41:12 A good book, even if it’s my 10th time reading it. Snuggle up with my love. Geranium essential oil in diffuser. Or clove oil. Very soothing.
158 2018-03-28 23:41:01 This dude Tyrone really had college students pulling double shifts at Mickie D’s going straight to lectures smelling of Big Mac oil while he flexed in Gucci flip flops with their Pell Grants. Savage af.
159 2018-03-28 23:40:55 Don't forget you've had a leadership shift, a collapse in oil price and austerity. Not only that, but Saudi negotiated the crap out of the kW/h, and that took a long time to reach the lowest number in the world.

162 2018-03-28 23:40:08 Had an Outback that was loud and used more oil than an ore boat. Subaru blamed me. I highly recommend you check out a Honda Pilot instead.

173 2018-03-28 23:38:22 Might have something to do with the fact that it is cheaper to extract oil from shale than bitumen and in a capitalist economy, the oil refineries prefer cheaper feed stock.

178 2018-03-28 23:37:39 They could generated all the power with oil and yet they are gonna do it with the sun. That is smart thinking. How cool is that?
179 2018-03-28 23:37:34 My family is ADAMANT I don't buy a personalized plate for our EV that reads BYE OIL. But with the blind ignorance of our current provincial government wasting taxpayer money trying to fight carbon pricing, I'm left with no choice. #skpoli #yqr #NoMoe

197 2018-03-28 23:35:13 new body oil? 
198 2018-03-28 23:35:07 maybe it was a face oil or toner or something? I’ve seen facial stuff that looks like perfume. Otherwise that’s a break out waiting to happen 
199 2018-03-28 23:35:06 “Data is the new oil.” - many people, but today via @crc of @heroku.

It’s the cool new thing to say, probably because it’s kind of a great analogy. #tdx2018 #data
200 2018-03-28 23:34:57 Kennedy for your intros you should use more health food themed phrases would be funny, like its my flaxseed induced party panel, or its my expeller pressed oil party panel, my non GMO party panel, its my grass fed party panel, so on.
201 2018-03-28 23:34:53 Prior to the 1970s; France burned oil for electricity, a Cleveland river was lit on fire, and the Los Angeles air caused respiratory issues for its people. Now, Cleveland, LA, and France have all improved their problems exponentially.
202 2018-03-28 23:34:53 my 86 year old great grandma just offered to smuggle cbd oil through the airport from california for my dad
203 2018-03-28 23:34:51 Woman next to me in my Uber clearly is an essential oil dealer and has decided to fill bottles NEXT to me in a very confined space! I feel like I am in a rolling hippie prison.....why me Lord?!?
204 2018-03-28 23:34:51 How much are the Oil & Gas royalties worth to the country?
205 2018-03-28 23:34:42 Nooo.  Maybe Imam did
206 2018-03-28 23:34:37 I believe deeply that children are more powerful than oil, more beautiful than rivers, more precious than any other natural resource a country can have. I feel that the most rewarding thing I have ever done in my life is to be associated with UNICEF.
207 2018-03-28 23:34:34 One gallon of used motor oil can ruin approximately one million gallons of fresh water
208 2018-03-28 23:34:34 Are you confident that companies conducting the survey will report sightings of whales? I'm not. And there's no way of monitoring that. And it's not just whales that are affected. Apart from the seismic survey, Newcastle has said we don't want an oil/gasfield off our coast.
209 2018-03-28 23:34:34 I’m actually really excited for those hot summer days when I can go out the house with damp hair and some coconut oil on and just glow like nobody’s business
210 2018-03-28 23:34:16 Such a sad situation for the wildlife that has suffered, and what’s also shocking is took 3 weeks for the oil company to respond to this environmental disaster – that’s just not acceptable! 
211 2018-03-28 23:33:58 Moisturiser commercial

Do you have skin?
Skin on your body?
All over your body?
Thats problematic.
Have this oil cream.
Put it on you.
Put it all over your body skin.
Just slather it on there
Like everywhere.
But not on your face
Not that.
Different cream for your face.
Buy it.
212 2018-03-28 23:33:56 おはようございます眠い
213 2018-03-28 23:33:51 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
214 2018-03-28 23:33:49 Look like oil comes to end in Saudi
215 2018-03-28 23:33:29 What do your arbitrary "standards" mean? Your certification monopoly is like Standard Oil
216 2018-03-28 23:33:27 So no investment in oil for US oil companies????? That would be a miracle
217 2018-03-28 23:32:32 Energy in Depth is funded by the El Paso Corporation, Occidental Petroleum, BP, Anadarko, Marathon, EnCana, Chevron, Talisman, Shell, API, the Independent Petroleum Association of America, Halliburton, Schlumberger and the Ohio Oil and Gas Association. Okey Doke.

219 2018-03-28 23:32:21 You can make them at home! They are made from ElJay Pretzels, sliced thin, topped with olive oil and seasonings, then rebaked. We used rosemary and pretzel salt. Give it a try and let us know what you think! They may be for sale in the future, so be sure to keep a lookout!

227 2018-03-28 23:31:30 and actually A person who follows a vegan diet produces the equivalent of 50% less carbon dioxide, uses 1/11th oil, 1/13th water, and 1/18th land compared to a meat-lover for their food. Worldwide, cows drink 45 billion gallons of water and eat 135 billion pounds of food each day
228 2018-03-28 23:30:46 You blocked him
229 2018-03-28 23:30:44 I was rush to close my $Oil short  position when it went back up to 6500, now waking up and finding it went below 6400  .... can’t catch every opportunity right 
230 2018-03-28 23:30:16 and the reason gas is so high is because of his antics/policies. We could be subsiding our own reserves. But instead we buy foreign oil and add a carbon tax on top of that...
231 2018-03-28 23:30:08 If I get my oil changes at jiffy lube, they are free. I just be forgetting tbh
232 2018-03-28 23:30:07 Put toothpaste on your nose. The floride will dry out the oil gland overnight. True Story

235 2018-03-28 23:29:55 AMEN
236 2018-03-28 23:29:38 Yes it will generate new jobs but is it worth the risk of another Deep Horizon ? How much damage was done to our environment then and can we live thru another. The world is moving away from oil should we go backwards or forward ?
237 2018-03-28 23:29:30 And when I'm talking about corruption, I'm not saying the pay-for-play ambassadorships scheme that Hillary and Obama ran. That, plus SOooo much more. The wars, the energy and military companies, the oil control. This corruption spreads despair and destruction worldwide.

241 2018-03-28 23:29:07 What you don't understand is that oilsands oil is sold at a discount because of the lack of pipelines, the lack of which has nothing to with market forces and everything to do with Liberal and NDP policies.
242 2018-03-28 23:29:02 guy at my dad’s work has been ordering skinny fries for years thinking they’re a “skinny” healthier alternative when in fact they’re even worse and are just crunchy sticks of oil
243 2018-03-28 23:29:01 yeah you gotta watch it with vinegar lol...I always overdo it 

have you tried them with just a bit of oil + old bay seasoning? delicious!
244 2018-03-28 23:28:47 The greeks invented olive oil so they could have gay anal sex more easily.

249 2018-03-28 23:27:53 Twins lol. But I used the pan I cooked the chicken in without washing it out. Added olive oil and cut up garlic. Let that cook. Butter, heavy whipping cream and cream cheese, salt and pepper
250 2018-03-28 23:27:50 Whose this idiot that blocked me???
251 2018-03-28 23:27:44 3-in-1 oil and gauze pads? There was no mention of these critical items.
252 2018-03-28 23:27:32 Yeah because Hulu owns oil filters completely the same
253 2018-03-28 23:27:24 also the cleansing oil sheets from VT cosmetics are AMAZING i might need to stock up on them t b h

255 2018-03-28 23:27:19 Ok. But perhaps your right was gonna re do it anyway as it’s been ruined by tX2/4 oil leaks!! 
256 2018-03-28 23:27:12 me: oil cleanse, face wash, toner, spot serum, lactic acid, eye cream, night cream, face oil 

bf: washes face once in the shower 

me: an actual walking pimple

bf: nice clear baby smooth skin
257 2018-03-28 23:27:11 From seeing the picture? That's cool. It's wild how some veggies can look so beautifully eldritch, yet end up tasting pretty much like...cauliflower. Mind you, I like cauliflower. I oven-roast it with halved Brussels' sprouts, with olive oil, rosemary, lemon juice & lemon zest.
258 2018-03-28 23:27:03 Whew Idk why I been chilling so hard on these oil changes . Haven’t gotten one since July and I been driving. Definitely going to get one this weekend 
259 2018-03-28 23:27:00 *solemly brushes hair while staring off into the distance like the mythical subject of a baroque oil painting except for that i am fully clothed and have no flowers in my hair and also am lying on the floor outside my locker*
260 2018-03-28 23:26:56 One thing I hate about coconut oil hair treatments is when I don’t wash it all out, I’m walking around looking like I haven’t washed my hair in 3 weeks.
261 2018-03-28 23:26:51 Understood. You can imagine the contribution Scotland makes to the UK wealth, in terms of oil, whisky & tourism. The Tory party in England are trying to undermine our stance in these industries in these markets, even now.
262 2018-03-28 23:26:49 LRT: I almost 100% stopped extra-curricular drawing 6 months ago. I stopped using my phone with my right hand, I stopped using my mouse with my right hand, I switched from Cintiq to Intuos. Ice, physical therapy, CBD oil, anti-inflammatories.
263 2018-03-28 23:26:47 Girl you still have that shit on??? Ya te dejé use coconut oil!!!
264 2018-03-28 23:26:37 My grandma said girls & boys are like oil & water they don’t mix 
265 2018-03-28 23:26:33 The British have never forgotten losing the 1850s Crimea war.
The Charge of the Light Brigade.
Seriously its all about oil and gas supplies into Europe via Russia Ukraine pipeline.
The west wants another via Syria and Turkey, so hene wars are in Syria and Ukraine now.
266 2018-03-28 23:26:30 I like my Spaghetti-O's with a sprig of fresh basil, some cracked pepper, a drizzle of first pressed extra virgin olive oil, and fresh grated parmesan crumble.  I pour some water and ice in a wine glass and I savor each bite like a happy critic at a Michelin rated restaurant.
267 2018-03-28 23:26:20 I hope somebody slides him the recipe for a nice castor oil serum. His eyebrows look like when you ask the lady to "just clean them up" and she has her own ideas.

270 2018-03-28 23:25:41 So having ID to vote is considered discrimination against the poor.  You want them now to have to go see a shrink every year in order to defend themselves?  So you just think people with proper means should have a gun or are taxpayers paying for that?
271 2018-03-28 23:25:32 Just waiting for the weather to be cool enough to baby oil myself, but hot enough for minimum clothing
272 2018-03-28 23:25:29 The so called Ahmadi are heretical and apostate; they worship a man on earth who they call Prophet. Death cult is what it is. Going str8 to hell!
273 2018-03-28 23:24:59 Checked the oil in my car and topped it off and then topped off the power steering fluid. I walk from my car towards my apartment after and my neighbor upstairs said “if I had a hat I’d tip it to you, you knew what you were doing!”
I sure do go women we can do anything!!!!!!
274 2018-03-28 23:24:44 I’ve had a headache for 4 days.  I broke it today with Tylenol 3, kava kava, curcumin, milk thistle (need to keep my liver happy) Valium, another muscle relaxant and CBD oil.  Just hope pain stays away
275 2018-03-28 23:24:25 It’s sad that it took this season for Oil fans to realize how bad their team really is without McD
276 2018-03-28 23:24:22 No shit!!!! Oil is at what, 65 bucks??? And there are 4 different taxes on gas.....  WHAT THE FUCK!???
277 2018-03-28 23:24:22 As long as your beef isn't beef-fed you'll be alright. Oil s&p, and a hot surface to start are the most important things.
278 2018-03-28 23:24:15 No, but olive oil/lavender moisturizing socks.
279 2018-03-28 23:24:07 I didn't check that, I did put a container under the sump bolt but half the oil ran everywhere else, most people would probably put the bolt back in at that stage
280 2018-03-28 23:23:34 What fool believes the snake oil story about attempts to repeal the Second Admendment? Damn, ya’ll still falling for trump lies? 
281 2018-03-28 23:23:30 First time was when the Soviet Union collapsed. We got Saudis to lower price of oil, oil was main linchpin of Russian economy. Still is.
282 2018-03-28 23:23:20 Trying to grow my eyebrows by putting castor oil on them. Hoping this works and saves me tons of money on micro blading them  WHY did I ever anxiously pick at my eyebrows 
283 2018-03-28 23:23:13 It's Shampoo. In the 80s and early 90s that was pretty much all there was in Libya. Sometimes you could get Johnson's baby shampoo. Many ppl used green olive oil soap or 'tide'
284 2018-03-28 23:23:06 Yeah, you’d think with all that oil as well as the wise words of Jones, Canavan & Co, they would know better than to foolishly spend $200B (is that correct?) of their money on renewables. Perhaps there is a consulting gig for Bilson over in Saudi?
285 2018-03-28 23:22:53 oooh, I usually just do oil+pepper (I like the level of salt just from the brine), but vinegar does sound good
286 2018-03-28 23:22:20 Simple fix! (aqueduct/wall) infrastructure! Sell water to Mexico,help states. Feeder lines. Like oil
287 2018-03-28 23:22:14 America needs a little shakeup. He sure has accomplished a lot.  I'm amazed how the North Korean denuclearization & global tariff negotiations are turning out. Surprised. Been hard on my Canadian oil holdings though. Need #MCGA. Hope NAFTA focus is on Mexico; where it should be.
288 2018-03-28 23:21:58 Labour, other stakeholders brainstorm on oil, gas new national policy
289 2018-03-28 23:21:53 After trial and error the only thing that has been clearing up my skin is dial soap and baby oil

Now, if I can just convince her that oil on canvas is the way to go.... JK.
293 2018-03-28 23:21:07 little vinegar,oil,salt and pepper and you're good to go

296 2018-03-28 23:20:35 thank you.  if you want your foundation to look smoother, try putting a tiny bit of grapeseed oil on your skin before your primer. I’ve been doing that lately and my foundation looks a lot smoother. Just don’t use too much cause then your foundation won’t really stick
297 2018-03-28 23:20:28 Then go microwave some coconut oil till it melts
298 2018-03-28 23:20:27 About to spend a fortune on legit vitamin e oil.

308 2018-03-28 23:18:54 My poor baby has reallt dry skin and is always itching. Just drentched her in coconut oil so fingers crossed this works
309 2018-03-28 23:18:51 Yes the majority of our 650 members do their own maintenance. Maintenance is a big priority with drivers be cause of the severe wear and tear, tires, oil changes, car washes, headlamp and turn signal lights always burning out because of frequent use.
310 2018-03-28 23:18:42 Nigerians in America be having MONEY. Idk what oil they be striking but i need a cut.
311 2018-03-28 23:18:33 In love with almond oil

315 2018-03-28 23:18:01 As the new Secretary of Space Force, I am currently using our tax payer allotted budget for paying off 12 prostitutes, and buying a 31,000 dollar oil painting made by Roy Moore.
316 2018-03-28 23:18:00 washed my car and got an oil change, did some tanning and a face mask and I feel accomplished lol it doesn't take much
317 2018-03-28 23:17:53 The coconut oil melts all the fat off your body anyway.
318 2018-03-28 23:17:36 simple exfoliators for your skin : 
• coconut oil 
• sugar
• added essential oil like lemon, orange or lavender 
OR
• fine sea salt 
• olive oil 
• essential oil of choice 
(lemon/peppermint are energising + lavender/chamomile are more soothing + relaxing)
319 2018-03-28 23:17:35 Took my 535d to BMW When I bought it for oil leak. New turbos required: Impeller play. Wanted £3k. Took it elsewhere and £50 breather fix 
320 2018-03-28 23:17:29 Might be a dumb question but do you brush your tongue too w the coconut oil ? @DannyAndCleo @RoaringGold
321 2018-03-28 23:17:28 The state department is not a global oil company. 

The VA is literally a not-for-profit enormous integrated health care system.
322 2018-03-28 23:17:18 Is AbikeDabiri etc and company still collecting Tax and Oil money?? If @MBuhari @NGRPresident  Don't sack a few with immediate effect, he is very aware and complicit.
323 2018-03-28 23:16:52 the articles are educating on plant based foods that have bad environmental impact (palm oil, avocados). they are just saying that demand has major impact. both articles further emphasize my point anyways cuz the majority of soy, wheat, corn, etc goes to the meat/dairy industries
324 2018-03-28 23:16:49 Our Father has a plan, and it should be trusted. Take care of yourself and your loved ones. Let them know whats coming. Plant seeds and whether they grow is Father's doing. When the next vial is poured out, Father's word will be cut off. A few handfuls will have enough oil. GBY

326 2018-03-28 23:16:13 When Saudi Arabia invests so heavily on solar energy, you know their oil tap is about to close.
327 2018-03-28 23:15:35 I've been using rosehip seed oil for whatever facial scars I have and it does a damn good job at moisturizing, just uh smells like blood
328 2018-03-28 23:15:32 Just wanna be in a warm bubble bath  marinating my hair in coconut oil with an avocado mask on whilst eating diced pineapples.
329 2018-03-28 23:15:00 i’m super oily and they both absorb a lot of the oil and make my skin look less greasy/shiny, so that’s always a plus lol.
330 2018-03-28 23:14:52 Visually really pretty, well acted, dubstep fractal alien was cool, could've done without the fight with the oil slick morph-suit. 
Reading the first book in the trilogy right now. So far it's very different. The movie team took concepts from the book & went their own way

332 2018-03-28 23:14:38 @AskTSA can artist's oil paints be brought in checked-on luggage?
333 2018-03-28 23:14:33 If you mix olive oil, rice vinegar, Dijon mustard, lime and honey into a bowl and put it on avacodos and tomatoes you won’t be disappointed 
334 2018-03-28 23:14:33 Great day a guy at oil lube shop says have a happy easter to me as trump has brought back god in people!#DonaldTrump
335 2018-03-28 23:14:30 No one wants to invade you. It's a pain in the ass and you don't have oil give it up
336 2018-03-28 23:14:18 Why the hell would you want to shock your penis. Eat plant based meals. Add moringa powder, to smoothies. Plus use its seed oil. You know where.
337 2018-03-28 23:14:11 I smell like fry oil and burgers 
338 2018-03-28 23:14:09 A Labour MP had a trip paid for by a company with deep connections to Turkey's oil minister. He was implicated in the mass import of ISIS oil into the country (funding terrorism). This same Labour MP has the temerity to point at others regarding 'national security'?!
339 2018-03-28 23:14:06 What do you use coconut oil for?
340 2018-03-28 23:14:05 That is what they need to be looking at...only logical thing to do.
341 2018-03-28 23:14:04 There's a story going around that the company he's involved in is selling ISIS oil, so it'd probably be better to get rid of him out of labour.
342 2018-03-28 23:14:03 the biggest barrier to entry to become an ISP is that you have two monopolies that are basically 21st century robber barons controlling the internet. No different than when Vanderbilt controlled all of the railroads or standard oil controlled all of the nations energy supplies.
343 2018-03-28 23:14:01 Meals I just can’t stand: 
Egg sauce with excess oil, water or both
Stews and/or soups with excess oil
Egusi soup that’s watery, or is a bit thick but has excess water surrounding that you have no idea what to do with
344 2018-03-28 23:13:29 Got into a scuffle yesterday with oil and coal advocates they called me ignorant and said they had plans for clean coal. Clean fossil fuels my Great Aunt Fanny
345 2018-03-28 23:13:19 I am complexity and simplicity, I am serenity and destruction. I am together but I am alone. I am love but full of hate. I am oil but made from water.
346 2018-03-28 23:13:16 In my experience, the 1st couple times with some 750mg oil....somewhat.
347 2018-03-28 23:12:59 Still have some boxes of purple dye and I'm thinking if I should die my hair today... but I'm trying to get moisture back in my hair, which means a lot of treatments and oil, aka bad for hair color 
348 2018-03-28 23:12:56 Ung oil na sinasabi mo, saka lang naman siguro gagamitin un kapag intended na tatanggalin talaga ung makeup. Ikaw talaga nagkalat kapa. Painject ka braincells.
349 2018-03-28 23:12:45 Should I oil my balls?
350 2018-03-28 23:12:42 So what? 
Oil is destroying the planet, if we have to pay taxes to have luxury of using it, then so be it. 
We use the cars, destroy the environment, drive on the roads which wears them out - paying to fix infrastructure is part of being able to use it. 

Only the greedy complain
351 2018-03-28 23:12:40 It's possible they are not properly disposing used oil. Might be a violation of RA 9275.
352 2018-03-28 23:12:38 @MitsubishiCAN @WestSideMitsu Nothing but the “run around” in getting our 2014 Lancer serviced.
Told we would be taken care of in #YEG for our continued free oil changes and car washes when we purchased the car in B.C. & now not even getting a courtesy wash. 
Worst service.
353 2018-03-28 23:12:29 if my oil changed itself I’d be as rich as you
354 2018-03-28 23:12:23 What?!  I was thinking oil or watercolor JR. This is fantastic!
355 2018-03-28 23:12:19 Ever seen a lot of innocent people and stealing their oil!
356 2018-03-28 23:12:03 car brake issue fixed i think . had to take the whole caliper off and just work around the jam lmao. one day ill get a proper service done. im covered in oil and grime n shit and probably should take a shower before i head down to the mechanic but ehhhhhhhhhhhhh
357 2018-03-28 23:11:49 Fake News! By the end of the summer, we won't have a U.S. Park System. We'll have #FrackedTheFuck out of every square inch or have oil fields as far as the eye can see.
358 2018-03-28 23:11:40 Excellent smoothie!  You may want to use Casein A2 milk. Consider adding blueberries,  kale, celery, cocao powder,  & coconut oil.
359 2018-03-28 23:11:26 What an incredible group! So many powerful people in one photo this should be painted In oil and hung in a rich mahogany frame at the top of the stairs since Drew destroyed our previous Portraits of Jobspring collection.
360 2018-03-28 23:11:24 So is this the hill we are to die on?

Destroy our party all to ensure a nice man who thinks the rich should share a little more and mass murder for oil is a bit much, doesn't get into power, even if it means a hard Tory Brexit.

We purged foofighters fans why not anti-Semites?
361 2018-03-28 23:11:21 Put castor oil in them
362 2018-03-28 23:11:11 Try using witch hazel after you wash your face!!! It’s dries out your blemishes so after apply like a natural moisturizers (I use rosehip oil)!! Anytime my face breaks out, i use a face scrub, apply witch hazel then moisturize!!!!
363 2018-03-28 23:10:54 Jaclyn, Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Femimist friendly Oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes oppress women. Pls tell is how u rationalize obstructing  Feminist Oil while enriching Dictator oil?  @WomensMarchCDA
364 2018-03-28 23:10:51 The link explains why he is the best player in the league. And I understand the notion that that means he is the most valuable as well. And no, if 97 changed unis with any other candidates the Oil wouldn’t be better off.

366 2018-03-28 23:10:32 I am waiting for a day when cars will not run on Oil, because I know a religion which runs on Oil money !
367 2018-03-28 23:10:27 He’s perfect for this job. Another clown in the DC circus. Forget the toxic superfund sites around the USA, unsafe drinking water, nuclear waste dumps, toxic rivers, lakes, oceans, oil spillage, Religious statues are the #1 priority.

370 2018-03-28 23:10:07 Customer came in for maintenance including timing belt and its components, drive belt, filter, plugs and oil change!!!
371 2018-03-28 23:10:05 Neither of those things are actually, materially, happening here, but it plays. It keeps us from discussing a government that is busily expanding the police state, slinging arms, allowing oil co's & banks to walk all over us, etc, etc, and an opposition keen on doing the same.
372 2018-03-28 23:10:04 girl yes they charged me $70 bucks for an oil change once lmaoo
373 2018-03-28 23:09:53 And possibly, some oil painting.

376 2018-03-28 23:09:42 This is what I am looking for.  How this regimes of CNY/CNH, gold, oil etc will work. If they are introducing the system there has to be official info somewhere
377 2018-03-28 23:09:08 Let's say everyone in the world becomes vegan (no animal based food but all plant based) we would need tractors, combined harvesters, conveyors to produce and process veggies. All these require power that comes from crude oil. Tell me about green house
378 2018-03-28 23:09:05 N power is no good. the only sustainable choice is renewable energies. after the 70's crisis the west found out that oil dependency is a killer. however the third world countries never heard the message clearly.they still like to play with N power plants. Ayyy..
379 2018-03-28 23:09:05 Why are oil companies being subsidized they are for profit corporations that pay earnings to shareholders so when do we the taxpayers get those profits returned to us???

383 2018-03-28 23:08:39 Use your oil money to invest in the next great energy! Synergy baby! Ice men became coal men. Coal men because oil men. Oil men now will become solar and wind men. Change with the times!

388 2018-03-28 23:08:03 I’m so sorry to hear this. It breaks my heart. To be fair Bo is 12 and a 90 lb Doberman. We have been very lucky. We tried CBD oil. We assumed it was wobblers disease. Some days he needs 2 pills instead of one but I’m very thankful. Sending good vibes to you guys.
389 2018-03-28 23:07:55 Before the fossil carbon in that plastic clogged up our landfills it was the fossil carbon component of the petroleum clogging up our oil and gas reservoirs. All underground.

395 2018-03-28 23:07:15 Oil industry and coal would have you believe that coal is clean and oil is great but we have proof it's a lie. Polluted air, wild fluctuating weather caused by auto and industry emissions and the declining jungles& forests that used to filter out all that.

404 2018-03-28 23:06:31 I really hate when the oil change guys are rude to me like sorry dude you don’t think I get enough anxiety rolling in here???
405 2018-03-28 23:06:24 Yes. My dad used to steam all of our gloves. He would buy a glove oil (of sorts) and apply it. Then put in the oven for about 30 mins. Directions usually come on the box. Right after it come out you need to work in it. Best to have a catch afterwards.

420 2018-03-28 23:04:32 #DidYouKnow  J. M. W. Turner depicted the fishermen of #Shoeburyness in his oil painting Shoeburyness Fishermen Hailing a Whitstable Hoy.
421 2018-03-28 23:04:31 Well. Oil's changed, but they want me to replace an expensive belt. And there's still the matter of the passenger tire which, while not immediately important, should be changed soon enough.
Ah, life.
422 2018-03-28 23:04:24 Anybody else remember when the "evil oil men" were in office, & we could somehow still afford gas? #goodtimes #p2 #p21 #topprog #Obama2012
423 2018-03-28 23:04:06 I hope we get a red on the monthly this week
424 2018-03-28 23:03:57 Washed my dirty work timbos with Murphy oil and they’re good as new
425 2018-03-28 23:03:53 We mix tea tree, lemongrass, and a little bit of lavender with any available (plant based) carrier oil and use it like the monthly flea treatment... Only shit do once a week.
Pisses then off but they smell nice and it decreases fleas a lot.
426 2018-03-28 23:03:50 You can make these so easily at home. I use ordinary table salt as rock salt is rough. Whizz up a whole lemon, peel and all and mix with salt. You can add oil if you want but don’t have to

431 2018-03-28 23:01:56 I've been holding and adding to Athabasca Oil Corp over the past year. Solid company with very nice prospects in both thermal oil & light. High beta stock that should really start to fly with sector turnaround. It seems $ATH has plenty of curioys lurkers.

@Duxing8 read!
432 2018-03-28 23:01:35 oil will always be hot tho

441 2018-03-28 23:00:31 Third week doing this coconut oil hair treatment. 
442 2018-03-28 23:00:30 That essential oil is soooooo HARD! BUSET!
443 2018-03-28 23:00:17 All you got is "carbon cost is too high"? Exactly WHAT "carbon" are you talking about - the BC coal industry produces 26 MILLION Tonnes per year using oil in the process. That one?
444 2018-03-28 22:59:47 Mine told me to only use coconut oil
445 2018-03-28 22:59:46 The U.S. had no interest in invading Iraq, We have the 2nd largest oil fields in the world. You Germans are the ones that want to control Iraqi oil. Rommel failed, Merkel succeeded.

447 2018-03-28 22:59:32 We understand! We know oil never sleeps!
448 2018-03-28 22:59:22 Attention UCP trolls. Guess what, if you like free health care, subsidized education, guaranteed due process, farmer subsidies, museums, child/senior protection, roads, parks, oil royalties, and guaranteed vacation time, then your a socialist too. #ableg
449 2018-03-28 22:59:18 2nd You realized that it made no more sense to support Saddam in the early 2000's and the German BND was the one telling Bush that Saddam is a problem. Why? Because you and your pal Erdogan want control over Iraqi oil which you now partly have.
450 2018-03-28 22:59:16 That hole was nothing compared to the hole that we are about to step into. The signs are there.   Huge tax cuts and accelerated deficit rate causing  weakening dollar and coupled with very possible higher oil prices.

454 2018-03-28 22:58:53 I am bullish on the long term prospects of oil. I’m surprised people can’t see the obvious mismatch between fundamentals and price

First of all it’s oil
459 2018-03-28 22:57:41 The bunny was shook, the sensuous touches by the snake woman were too strong, too pleasurable, the oil aphrodisiac making her even more submissive to her will, she rocked her hips in glee as the sensitivity ointment was applied.

No more...no more!

478 2018-03-28 22:55:45 Just reading an article and discovered there is a plastic that is natural, non toxic, biodegradable 5x stiffer and 2.5x stronger and it's made from the #hemp plant. Why can't we stop using toxic oil based plastics when nature provides an  alternative.#plastic
479 2018-03-28 22:55:31 Here's an easy butter bean snack (like easy fake hummus): 
Chop up many cloves of garlic, put in bowl with olive oil, add tin butter beans, stir, microwave 2 mins. Mush up with more olive oil, yoghurt, lemon juice, salt & pepper, cumin, paprika, parsley. Eat.

485 2018-03-28 22:55:02 Really? This might sound dumb but is that legit? I’ve never thought to look for trips on there, I only used it for oil changes before I started doing it myself lol
486 2018-03-28 22:55:00 The way I meditate is different every time. Sometimes it's a yoga meditation, or I meditate with crystals, deep breathing, or complete stillness and silence. Sometimes I light my essential oil diffuser, listen to music, mantras, chant, watch the stars.... Thank you for asking.

489 2018-03-28 22:54:19 how many people are supported by the oil industry? guess you can never support clean energy.
490 2018-03-28 22:54:14 Jojoba oil.
Helps with dry skin. I put it in my face and my stretched ears.

493 2018-03-28 22:53:49 To kill the wait time of my oil change I took a stroll into the workout stuff isle and just realized how much I miss working out and how fast I would whip back into shape. I think it’s time for a reboot

501 2018-03-28 22:52:44 “Hey dad my oil needs to be changed”

Dad: “Oh no don’t do that, they won’t use the right stuff”

* In a non stick pan heat some olive oil & add washed rice. Stir until lightly browned. 
* Add tomato mix & stir 4 a couple of minutes

514 2018-03-28 22:49:42 Discussion about renegotiations has indeed been in the news, but it's about the price they're paying (read: still importing gas), not ending the shipments. India will be a major importer of oil and gas for a long time, and it's increasingly coming from the U.S.

523 2018-03-28 22:47:54 Is oil a dirty fossil fuel?!? This garbage is laughable to the point of misery.
524 2018-03-28 22:47:45 Success!
Of course now it smells a bit like bleach. I’d spray it with clove oil, but the oil, while preventing mould, would gunk up stuff.
525 2018-03-28 22:47:25 You don reach the bus Stop way i want Make u reach. Take note!!!
526 2018-03-28 22:47:24 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
527 2018-03-28 22:47:19 Yea saw this too. Guess this validates his statement on @60Minutes "Saudis will not be solely reliant on oil"-or something to that affect
528 2018-03-28 22:47:07 So there it is. Real objective of critics is to keep the oil in ground. No transition. To hell w/ people impacted.
529 2018-03-28 22:47:06 We desperately need to stop Alaska oil tankers from plying up & down the west coast loaded with oil. We need to urgently stop every Barge that ship 40% of our gas from the USA into Strait of Juan de Fuca. Lastly stop new14k airport jet fuel pipeline into Richmond. Save the Orca's

533 2018-03-28 22:46:37 Yeah seriously. Fuck all religions. If you are dumb enough to think an invisible man wrote a book then dropped it from there sky then you deserve to be taken for everything you've got by these spiritual snake oil salesmen. Every religion is fake. Don't censor me. #truthbombs
534 2018-03-28 22:46:30 Better than her whole head being the colour of cooking oil like her ends currently are 
535 2018-03-28 22:46:26 Huh?? Such an insane world renewable energy should be excluded from oil and gas development. 1) Typically we see oil and gas should not be excluded from renewable eng development or don't talk abt it shhhhh 2) In climate emergency; No New Wells & Immediate Drawdown Existing wells
536 2018-03-28 22:46:17 Then you take those outside and just start stepping on them till they are flat (that’s how you get the flavor to really come out) 
Next you want to use the excess oil from bacon after you cook it. And start frying the bananas.
537 2018-03-28 22:46:12 And here was me thinking that the point of the Kinder Morgan pipeline was to make money for shareholders & perhaps for oil sands companies. There may be better ways to invest in made-in-Canada hydrogen technology than building an export pipeline.
538 2018-03-28 22:46:12 Haha, at last you guys got busted. But they should have caught you guys for selling snake oil supplements instead.
539 2018-03-28 22:46:08 Also, when will I stop crying over the most silliest things like why does every chocolate on this earth contain palm oil
540 2018-03-28 22:46:04 そうそう
541 2018-03-28 22:45:49 creo que fue mala decisión ponerme tan oil
542 2018-03-28 22:45:35 Well Scotland’s waters are other half of n.Sea oil
Norway created an oil fund and is now the 4th richest country in the world!
Thatcher sold our oil to oil co’s (guess who shareholders would be)

We collect revenues
Guess what - despite oil flowing - UK OWES the oil co’s tax!
543 2018-03-28 22:45:16 Check your Engine oil this morning.
544 2018-03-28 22:45:13 All the things we facing make us question it.. lead us to salvation, pour that oil please. That’s how we become kings & queens.

548 2018-03-28 22:44:17 No doubt the US does it cheaper and more stringent standards are appropriate for the UK. Mistakes have been made in pioneering the technology but the economic benefits have been huge and shale oil from US has broken the OPEC monopoly.
549 2018-03-28 22:43:38 I’ve got an oil for that lol
550 2018-03-28 22:43:34 How about this for misuse of info. Take car for oil change, business uploads info including mileage to carfax, 1/2
551 2018-03-28 22:43:29 Shame on the UN for denying oppression in #Yemen...

555 2018-03-28 22:43:16 Thank you. I am truly astounded I got a personal reply from Tescos. 

Gobsmacked. 

Travelled a lot as well and seen the extent of the damage done. 

Won't start on palm oil.....that sends my gears grinding.
556 2018-03-28 22:42:59 I was at the @Toyota car dealership today to get my brakes inspected and oil changed. They did a wonderful job! This had to be tweeted, and not just a thought to keep to myself.
557 2018-03-28 22:42:53 I may have missed something, are you referring to the greenback as the reserve currency?  Petrodollars are only important during high oil prices with high importation. The price of oil is low now and the US is becoming neutral as far as importation.

571 2018-03-28 22:39:43 Hemp oil is now legal in all 50 states. You can buy it at health stores. As far as nerve damage I dont know.  I take a high dose of gabapentin for that
572 2018-03-28 22:39:40 Anyways I love this carrot cake recipe bc it uses buttermilk and oil instead of butter so I don't have to worry about creaming it with the eggs and tuning the cake texture when it bakes, rises and falls
573 2018-03-28 22:39:15 You are dangerously wrong.  People WERE kind to Nicholas Cruz, until he proved himself too violent to be with.  That's not a problem children can solve.  Stop pushing this snake oil!
574 2018-03-28 22:39:03 how come I can never meet someone from Alberta that isn't an oil loving conservative?
575 2018-03-28 22:38:56 it's basically crepe batter, but you cook it in the oven, in a muffin/cupcake tin or similar, using very hot oil! They can be tricky to get right, i don't remember the last time i cooked them from scratch, usually buy frozen lol 
576 2018-03-28 22:38:47 Just because I use oil doesn’t justify the reckless transportation of 7 times the tanker traffic of dirty bitumen in our coastal waters. If you want BC to consent process the bitumen in Alberta. You are exporting jobs by selling it unrefined!

581 2018-03-28 22:38:01 I feel like an intermittent fasting ketogenic esports team who meditates uses full spectrum CBD oil, exercises 2 days a week  would be a lot better than a degenerate stream monster team.

592 2018-03-28 22:36:36 Big Oil is committing crimes cuz it has identity issues, end of life problems, and massive greed.
593 2018-03-28 22:36:30 Where did all this oil based material originate from, outer space? Oil is formed from old organic matter and stored in the earth to be reusable. Reused it can make materials to grow and sustain humans. Address the waste reuse...

598 2018-03-28 22:35:25 That's the reason Dubai is Dubai. They've intentionally built a tourist hub as a contingency for when the oil runs out in 50 years. That's the whole purpose of it!

603 2018-03-28 22:34:52 I have my own views on other cultures based on what I have seen with my own eyes.  If I say "I live in Alberta and the pollution is so bad that the rivers have turned black like oil" does anyone in this conversation have to believe me?
604 2018-03-28 22:34:44 I've got a good one for ya. Came home from work and kicked off my shoes ran up the wood stairs in my socks, made it to the 3rd stair and slipped/slid back down. Almost peed myself lol, kid had used orange oil to clean the floors

620 2018-03-28 22:31:21 Maybe you should start updating the old resume. Surely some of your oil or big game buddies would hire you.
621 2018-03-28 22:31:13 this was about a bill proposed in MN leg, that further criminalizes peaceful protest and organizing against oil pipelines - bill has major problems with civil liberties violations and is likely unconstitutional

647 2018-03-28 22:27:11 That's the other problem I see with folks pushing hemp oil, etc. Its literally not available to everyone. 

But, it's awesome to know that marijuana ointment works for back pain. I've wondered if it would work for nerve damage.

705 2018-03-28 22:16:32 I used to enjoy oil changes here and there, and then I started working on Land Rovers
706 2018-03-28 22:15:56 I just got an oil change before my oil life hit the negatives like some kind of billionaire.

709 2018-03-28 22:15:37 Oil subsidies are massive in Canada, EVs deserve the same. Either remove the Oil subsidies or keep the EVs subsidies.

719 2018-03-28 22:13:57 @carlsonlabs the new caps for the Carlson fish oil is the least consumer friendly decision I’ve encountered this year. BRUTAL. Took me 10 minutes to open my latest bottle just now. They don’t screw back tight either.
720 2018-03-28 22:13:39 I need to clean the cassettes at some point, but cleaned the chain today. Just need to oil it

730 2018-03-28 22:12:25 If you aren’t going to the dr, I’d soak that in some Epsom salt, then pour colloidal silver (at least 25ppm) on it and then make a baking soda paste mixed with tea tree oil and put the paste on top of it until you can get to the dr. Also take arnica 30x (4 tablets every 4 hrs).

734 2018-03-28 22:12:00 If you were looking to identify or detect anything using machines...what would it be?  Would it be identifying a blood type? How about a different grade of oil? Or even telling the difference between seeds?

WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO IDENTIFY? #yeg #agchat #MedEd #science #Detective
735 2018-03-28 22:11:31 I knew I was a lil surprised when they said d award was for @mbuhari corruption fight cos I asked myself. Which fight? But I Neva expected this. Dis new low is not like looking for crude oil. It's more like looking for hell-fire.

757 2018-03-28 22:08:49 Oh hell no!



I prefer free of animal products but thanks to vegetable oil that shouldn’t be a problem.
758 2018-03-28 22:08:48 yessss I whipped unrefined shea butter with coconut oil and some other oils 
759 2018-03-28 22:08:29 Dont put seseme oil put very end and quick stir and take out
760 2018-03-28 22:08:25 I agree GMOs should be labeled and that seeds should not have herbicides in them. But, I am not in panic mode yet. Gimmie, some time, I'm working on no palm oil and not nitrates rn.

764 2018-03-28 22:07:55 I wouldn't expect your family to recognize  an uinfair election-that would defeat the purpose of the exercise.
 I will say, anyone who sees no problem with Russian oil 'privatized' & owned by the same oligarchs that own & run State Media (RT),perhaps just aren't that observant ?

776 2018-03-28 22:05:39 So, The Eleventh Letter, AKA .@XiiXMusic does not care that he is tweeting fake information.  I wonder if it is a bot, working for the benefit of Arab oil, or USA oil....
777 2018-03-28 22:05:35 I'm sure they think their last move to sink oil prices (2014-2017) was an accident given US shale's screaming success coming out of it.
778 2018-03-28 22:05:34 Cbd allowed me to half my tramadol intake buuuuut then my pain increased so I'm now back to the same dose! My trick is pressing my tongue to the roof of my mouth the whole time the oil is in your mouth then just downing with fizzy drink.
779 2018-03-28 22:05:19 Melatonin, magnesium and Benadryl work great as far as OTC sleep aids go.  Trazadone (prescription) will knock you out but make you feel sedated the next day.  Lavender oil works well too, check out the studies.  I have problems sleeping due to pain/MS.
780 2018-03-28 22:05:11 Having a lot of reserves doesn’t make your extraction or delivery costs competitive. If they were, Irving Oil would buy Alberta oil rather than Norwegian/Venezuelan. Market doesn’t lie pumpkin.
781 2018-03-28 22:04:50 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.
782 2018-03-28 22:04:45 Oh yeah ima definitely have to try that out... I’m using the Argan oil one right now lol

785 2018-03-28 22:04:22 I do not get oil paintings of me on the back of tax payers, why should they.  Great job Trump.  It is only sad that you even had to do it.  Keep draining the swamp irrespective of party.
786 2018-03-28 22:04:09 My favourites are the rosehip oil (it reeks but it’s awesome), the granactive retinoid, lactic acid and azelaic acid suspension (DON’T use all that stuff at once or your face will fall off). Not sure if Buffet is doing anything, pretty sure the CaffeineSolution definitely isn’t.
787 2018-03-28 22:03:42 .... awesome hemp oil might be, I am not in a place to purchase it. And, I don't think given how much extra cash is already spent for holistic meds that I need, I am not going to waste money on what my insurance covers. Oh, and I tried a friend's med marijuana and I got so sick.
788 2018-03-28 22:03:38 So who is oil find to lie on his medical next year?

812 2018-03-28 21:59:00 ah yes, "the left," because everyone in a group has exactly the same ideas and opinions, and the most extreme ideas always carry the day.
So that means you're on the "right" and want electroshock conversion therapy for gays, repeal all labor laws, and put oil rigs on every beach.

The Union does not work.

823 2018-03-28 21:56:02 Get oil tankers out of Oceans. A lot of waste comes from them. Use our own oil and gas so much cleaner.
824 2018-03-28 21:55:48 also as a person with hyperosmia I've researched both diffusers and oil burners and noticed that they both make oils smell differently wtf?
825 2018-03-28 21:55:43 Our sensorial botanical cleanser starts like an oil & lathers up once water is applied,transforming your cleanse to a luxurious experience 
826 2018-03-28 21:55:36 Mix Jamaican black castor oil with wild growth oil and coconut oil. And any other oil that promotes growth. And have her apply it consistently
827 2018-03-28 21:55:32 But seriously if you actually did your research and understand the greenhouse effect (which farmers with greenhouses use every day) then you wouldn’t have to trust a federal agency (much less pretty much every scientist out there except oil shills).
828 2018-03-28 21:55:31 So one family gets: A bag of rice, oil and seasoning(salt)..

830 2018-03-28 21:54:41 Finally getting my oil changed for my car, and my tires refilled...and that head light fixed...and windshield fixed....

Pretty excited! I just won’t have food for the next 2 weeks! Worth it!
831 2018-03-28 21:54:36 Really ? What about the e-mobility movement disrupting the old oil driven technologies in no time? (What does Elon Musk say ? ). Also the general reduction of carbon dioxide emitting energy sources. Further, AI, ML etc. will soon show new ways how to enhance energy efficiency
832 2018-03-28 21:54:31 The nite is as dark as my soul &amp; as in my apartment. My apartment is also dark b/c I ran out of lamp oil. My soul is also out of lamp oil.
833 2018-03-28 21:54:28 You don’t trust the EPA, I actually took the time to understand the science. Furthermore the data and analysis comes from multiple sources many of which have no financial incentive, while only scientists who disagree are directly funded by oil industry. How do you ignore that?
834 2018-03-28 21:54:05 Foreign organizations such as 350. org, and Tides Foundation are funding these protests. Their goal: keep Cnd oil landlocked, allowing US to by Cnd oil cheaper and the US selling their #oil to world markets. Now the largest exporter of oil to the world.
835 2018-03-28 21:53:56 I’ve been screaming laughing. She forgot she put oil in the pot 
836 2018-03-28 21:53:07 Ehn ehn I just tried palm oil then boooooom

838 2018-03-28 21:52:58 How is cottonseed oil still in our food supply???? @US_FDA @FDArecalls
839 2018-03-28 21:52:55 Equal parts egg, milk and flour. Some salt. Add enough oil to cover the bottom of each muffin cup, in the oven at 450º until it's almost smoking. Pour in the batter and leave the door closed until they look like these. FYI, this was 1/2Cup of each.
840 2018-03-28 21:52:49 Our rambler was our first car and it took a can of oil every 25 miles!  One trip we drove that thing from Huron, South Dakota to Sioux Falls, Iowa!  EXPENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING!!!!!!!!!
841 2018-03-28 21:52:47 I gonnA try the rosemary oil I’ll let u Know
842 2018-03-28 21:52:44 I will read it, but I still have grave concerns about Nestlé's water extraction in Pakistan, North America and Canada plus it's inability to guarantee the sourcing of palm oil without rainforest destruction. However, thank you for your courtesy.
843 2018-03-28 21:52:25 bio oil !!!
844 2018-03-28 21:52:24 Remember his speaker spoke on not meddling in business of Russia, but the president bombed out of purpose of meddling to seemingly become a hero, distracting citizens from truth. Could reformation of oil refinements be a clean-handed trade? @msnbc @cspan
845 2018-03-28 21:52:22 The problem is, they all already do, and probably don't even know how they're doing it, thanks to all the digital agencies, adtech snake oil middlemen and ignorant 'heads of digital marketing'
846 2018-03-28 21:52:17 'It' means 'oil'. We sentenced those kids to a slow & painful death for the crime of being born in Iraq. To be fair we did kill the next 500,000 much more humanely. Yemen Seige War is even more dealy but not quite as official on paper. U.S is a rogue nation out of control.
847 2018-03-28 21:52:02 Kasoy oil lang yan
848 2018-03-28 21:51:45 Drop some tea tree oil down in your shampoo bottle and always spray some light hairspray on your hair before going to work. It will repel it!
849 2018-03-28 21:51:38 I was going to watch your show, But then I remembered I would rather boil my head in oil.
850 2018-03-28 21:51:29 Do you ever underestimate how far coconut oil will go and then use way too much only to become a slippery monster, because same
851 2018-03-28 21:51:28 I’m such a nerd..I watched a 30 minute demonstration on this cooking set and squealed like a little girl when dude showed me how you didn’t need oil or anything to do this paper thin egg in the pan 
852 2018-03-28 21:51:26 I need to start carrying my bible and anointing oil everywhere. Howard needs it.
853 2018-03-28 21:51:23 《オリーブ油豆知識》
オリーブ油は オレイン酸が腸の刺激を促してくれるため、便秘解消効果がある
854 2018-03-28 21:51:22 Anything with the initials “BP” means Black Panther to me. I’ve been researching an oil company thinking it had anything to do with the movie 
855 2018-03-28 21:51:19 It's not the oil, Rob, it's the tailings.
856 2018-03-28 21:51:12 This just in: the guy who last changed the oil in Trump's limo to be named chief mechanic of Air Force One. #peterprinciple
857 2018-03-28 21:51:04 Check how much money goes into the exchequer from oil in Scotland and what the reserves are.Scotland is in the top 10 richest countries
858 2018-03-28 21:50:51 Breaking: 10 minutes ago, Curiosity detects presence of oil on the red planet. 5 minutes ago, U.S. declares war on Mars.
859 2018-03-28 21:50:50 Oil industry? #RFID is being used to automatically identify assets out in the field, in lay down yards, on rigs, & wherever there's #oil.
860 2018-03-28 21:50:48 Good one! But only superficially. N. simply overplayed his hand, as you say. Hitler sort of tried the same stunt (race for Mokow before winter), but changed plans midway, diverting troops already before Moskow to the south to make for the oil of Baku and Iraq, (next)
861 2018-03-28 21:50:38 Ehn ehn so you are always doing palm oil?
862 2018-03-28 21:50:25 Don’t let the US find out this tweet has oil in it
863 2018-03-28 21:50:22 Use that with Jamaican coconut castor oil too.
864 2018-03-28 21:50:07 For well cooked but still tender, fry on a high heat for 4 minutes each side, then put in an oven dish -oil and all- cover with foil, heat for 15mins at 160degrees.. Though I prefer steak rare,  I never get it right 
865 2018-03-28 21:49:57  people actually believe this tweet? This government worker then tried to sell me a bridge and some snake oil
866 2018-03-28 21:49:54 Climate denial has no basis in evidence whatsoever. It’s greed & support for the oil and gas industries period.
867 2018-03-28 21:49:29 NoCarson is next, Zinke is delivering for oil&gas
868 2018-03-28 21:49:14 i deeply regret spilling exactly one drop of lavender oil on my hoodie because imma smell like a reiki studio for the next decade
869 2018-03-28 21:49:10 So weird but if you get lavender essential oil and rub it on your temple or smell it occasionally when you have a headache it will help it go away, I do it all the time.
870 2018-03-28 21:48:46 Loving this "America when they hear about oil" meme 

More memes critiquing imperialism please
871 2018-03-28 21:48:40 It is like trying to explain weights and viscosity in motor oil. I think the lack of understanding either through ignorance or obfuscation precludes them from having a position on the matter entirely.
872 2018-03-28 21:48:36 Coconut oil & tea-tree oil are also very good for the skin as well as face washes containing glycolic acid which exfoliates your skin and helps w/ hyperpigmentation & salicylic acid which cleans pores, helps w/ breakouts and builds elastin and collagen.
873 2018-03-28 21:48:19 I have been in the oil patch for many years. How long have you been in the cabbage patch.  If you don’t know anything about a topic, msybe just sit back, and learn things before spouting if.
874 2018-03-28 21:48:05 I could go on an on with bible versus about cannabis, including the recipe In Exodus 30:22-25; God gave to Moses the recipe for the holy anointing oil (Hebrew word, Kaneh bosem, aka, the fragrant reed, is cannabis).
875 2018-03-28 21:48:02 The guy who changed his limo oil will be named to Commerce Secretary soon, watch.
876 2018-03-28 21:47:42 Well, she help them make hundreds of billions of dollars of income and scores of billions in Texas. Have you noticed how well the economy is doing due to the oil?
877 2018-03-28 21:47:35 Lavender essential oil works too I believe... The Padres should really be paying us for this.
878 2018-03-28 21:47:23 Better than anywhere in the world,  yes. Check out Southern California's disaster zone oil fields. The messaging from Day1 should have been, we are going to clean up the ground from oily soil, and oozing into the Athabasca.
879 2018-03-28 21:47:05 Do you have the time today to talk about our Lord and savior Canola Oil?
880 2018-03-28 21:47:02 Need to do my oil change soon
881 2018-03-28 21:47:01 Popeye....Remember the cartoon character who always had victory in his battles but was as lovable as could be...Olive Oil was his girl. Wimpy ate his hamburgers.
882 2018-03-28 21:47:00 @ Jah Chef Twitter

What happens if u make popcorn in “seed” oil
883 2018-03-28 21:47:00 I tried it. It's expensive as hell, tastes like coal oil with a faint hint of mint, & I did not see enough improvement 2 justify the cost. If you could use a full dropper twice a day it possibly could, but at $175.00 for 60 doses X 2, ($350.) its just not financially realistic.
884 2018-03-28 21:46:30 we never seem to rid ourselves of the oil problem but not having the sense to use coal wisely is beyond ridiculous!!
885 2018-03-28 21:46:19 Dude these oil memes are getting me fucking weak I’m dying of giggles
886 2018-03-28 21:46:14 Maybe after all of this has passed and the criminals locked up, you can join the team. Right now there’s too much conflict of interest everywhere. I hope you get to go back one day SOON! Stay strong and remember the squeaky wheel gets the oil!!!
887 2018-03-28 21:46:03 you had 17% of the National Budget and rich oil Kirkuk... Nobody have received a salary for years.. You need to explain to your people the way you operate.
888 2018-03-28 21:46:01 Definitely didn’t plan on walking out spending all this money...I only came in for an oil change, smh.
889 2018-03-28 21:45:55 Let it come to room temperature. Put oil, a little salt and pepper each side. Make sure the pan is very hot (oil it up, wet fingers, flick at pan, when it spits it's hot enough). After cooking, let it rest for 2 mins before cutting into it.
Well done and above is a mistake.
890 2018-03-28 21:45:55 Shame on U! Saw ur town hall, no to 1 payer, no to free tuition, yes on bank dereg.! Both SPHC & FT could be if we stop oil subsidies & cut military spending. Good Idea, u in congress donate ur contributions from Oil, Health ind., Pharma, & Bank indus. 2 pay 4 those progams!
891 2018-03-28 21:45:08 A bot must tap on the Settings app.
A bot must not limit alcohol consumption.
A bot must decide which oil to use.

893 2018-03-28 21:44:59 I know the bank . Rude people giving service in most institute. One guy saw my dressing and concluded I couldn't speak English in Abuja. In freaking Abuja. Chopped his head raw till I left the place guy didn't misbehave again. Nonsense
894 2018-03-28 21:44:42 @Acura told me they would replace my engine at no cost due to oil consumption defect. Then refused to do it. What are you going to do about it??  #acura
895 2018-03-28 21:44:39 So happy I’ve been back at work this week back to making that crazy cash

901 2018-03-28 21:44:10 You had rich oil Kirkuk in your possession but you have nothing to do with unpaid salaries,  with the same Kirkuk Baghdad pay pension, salaries, social coverage plus 12% of the National Budget.

912 2018-03-28 21:43:20 Swear only thing on us oil field workers mind when we head home is COOCH !   
913 2018-03-28 21:43:19 Isn’t this the oil you use @courtgate4 ?
914 2018-03-28 21:43:18 And if you can screw your fellow man for you own self interest so be it.   Golly I wonder how Jews got their stereotype.    At least they have an excuse.  What's yours?

Ayn Rand grew up ripping people off selling snake oil to Russian.

We might not b able 2 drink well water, swim n a river, or breath w/o a mask, but boy wud the Big Boy’s be rolling in dough. U guys want to dump all regs? If not, which ones?
921 2018-03-28 21:41:58 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
922 2018-03-28 21:41:57 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

927 2018-03-28 21:40:50 "We're growing like crazy over here, and as long as the planet doesn't keep warming up and oil remains the lifeblood of the energy industry we're in great shape to beat you suckers!"

934 2018-03-28 21:40:05 I read California olive oil is better than what the Italians make.
935 2018-03-28 21:40:05 Sauteed can be another one to avoid. Most often #restaurants use a lot of oil and/or butter in the sauteeing...cause it makes the food taste good. Really, nearly all fried foods taste pretty good! That's why they do it. #nutrition #getsmart

939 2018-03-28 21:39:40 Thanks for letting us know you’re just another shill for oil&gas.
940 2018-03-28 21:39:33 Here is a summary of Glen's fuller summary:

RENEWABLES growth MET ONLY 25% of primary energy's 2.1% growth.    

EFFICIENCY growth:   MINUS 1.7%.    

FOSSIL FUEL growth:  Coal 1%,  Oil 1.6% [ flying grew >7% ] ,  Gas 3%.  

[Two years past Paris, we need a different approach.]
941 2018-03-28 21:39:04 it’s yogurt with olive oil and chopped garlic topped with a poached egg and bit of sage and garlic that you’ve friend in butter
942 2018-03-28 21:38:58 i was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna
943 2018-03-28 21:38:50 I told my bf the laundry is done and I got an oil change before I leave for vacation and then that I ordered dinner... he really said “thanks mom! You’re the best”

947 2018-03-28 21:38:11 Theres one thing a rich man canmme so stand and thats having to wait for his order to be pn wal-mart laced in society thus takeimg controll from him its simpler than refusing oil shipping and refining righhts to a particular city on a hunch i could gain somethimg.
948 2018-03-28 21:38:10 The fool is on his way to Dubai. Most likely they will keep him in the airport for a number of days!
949 2018-03-28 21:38:07 So you don't mind that the OPEC nations have some of the worst environmental standards, and would rather have it shipped halfway around the planet, than produce it here in our own backyard? The oil market is still climbing,  why as Canadians do we continue to sabotage ourselves?

951 2018-03-28 21:38:03 What the heck is the donkey lady thing?? The new sculpture tower visible from I 35 in South San Antonio is about the donkey lady, lechuzas, and oil rigs. So... donkey lady???
952 2018-03-28 21:37:47 Also the only time I heard this mentioned was on one America News Network a Muslim married couple in South Texas sold their daughter to be married for $20,000 she did not want to get married they beat her and poured hot oil all over her body
953 2018-03-28 21:37:32 Oh WHOA I’ll just mix some highlighter and coconut oil 
954 2018-03-28 21:37:26 Wash it less, use a different shampoo to handle the oil
955 2018-03-28 21:37:26 I don’t even need to be inebriated, just pass me some oil based paint pens. You know. Hypothetically.
956 2018-03-28 21:37:09 The only thing Jason Whitlock ever puts to rest is his food.

Kaepernick protested the cold-blooded murder of black men by white cops. Saying it's not about race is like saying the Iraq War wasn't about oil.
957 2018-03-28 21:36:56 FANG is the story for sure.  Can't rotate from FANG this time to oil or international corps if the dollar just curled upward from a low.  No rotation = huge downside risk.  

The market needs a Bullard dove statement.  That rescued it many times before
958 2018-03-28 21:36:55 I can’t believe I just dumped a whole damn bottle of vegetable oil on me.  I look like the ducks off the @DawnDish commercial
959 2018-03-28 21:36:55 Low oil prices have been the job killers, not the climate plan the NDP did in fact campaign on. Now that I think about it, shouldn’t you be sitting as an independent? I don’t recall you campaigning on creating a new party. #ucp #wrp #abpoli #ableg

961 2018-03-28 21:36:51 What about tax revenue? Do you know how many ppl, countrywide would be positively effected? A boom in economies related to those materials and trades, those poor (and rich) border towns bringing in tons of $ from workers. I'm in oil, migrant work and booms run this country.
962 2018-03-28 21:36:47 On a simple technical basis it's an asc triangle. US frackers are seeing tapering of previous well production, and Bolton is . Oil stocks are cheap but I agree they could stay that way.

970 2018-03-28 21:35:47 Sorta surprised you never mentioned that “fast-growing Houston” is perhaps the most unsustainable city in America - built on oil wealth in a desert yet maddeningly susceptible to flooding. 21st century trifecta that 20/20 hindsight will not be kind to.

Olive oil + a pinch of salt + cashew milk + strawberries + wasabi paste = Strawberry-Wasabae Salad Dressing
988 2018-03-28 21:34:03 my cat just attacked me cause i gave him love after putting tea tree oil on my pimples. lil man does not like the smell of tea tree.
989 2018-03-28 21:33:56 It’s oil free so it should work fine. I have normal to dry skin.

992 2018-03-28 21:33:36 Hyperpigmentation is my biggest issue too!!! Cystic acne can bite me ugh. But the vitamin c and e oil have REALLY helped, way more than any other product, even retinols. Glycolic and chemical exfoliant/peels (like the origins one) helped me too!

996 2018-03-28 21:33:08 Kasie...she has to go! No on single payer, constituents want but health industry donors don't. Free tuition response, "government can't pay 4 everything" cut oil subsidies & military spending & both could happen. & voted 4 bank dereg. How many more need to lose homes & pensions!

999 2018-03-28 21:31:45 Yesssss

Exactly! The only thing I miss is letting people play with and style my hair. That's honestly it.

Brushing it, detangling it, washing it, getting it caught in shit like jacket zippers, turning into the oil monster from the black lagoon if I don't wash every say...
1000 2018-03-28 21:31:22 I need insurance a tune up shocks & a oil change i been tryna do this shit 4 a week
1001 2018-03-28 21:31:10 Gotta soak it in vinegar to oust that texture. Little cornmeal and some hot oil and we got a meal.
1002 2018-03-28 21:31:09 @BBCWorld @BBCNews That's because, my BOLs is the ultra new oil

1004 2018-03-28 21:30:52 Democrats,  Shumer  &  Pelosi agreed to export gasoline for the first time ever.  Now we pay $2.85,  likely $3 when the usual Memorial Day price hike. They just rolled over for the Republicans and big oil. They sell it in for equivalent  $11 in Europe.
1005 2018-03-28 21:30:45 Yessss is a big scam. If you calculate the number of people banking with them with the card maintenance,  withdrawal and transfer deduction you will come to the conclusion this banks are silently sucking us dry.
1006 2018-03-28 21:30:44 $135 for an oil change and some new air filters. Crazy
1007 2018-03-28 21:30:30 At least they didn't use bat oil on the ball. Once had a bottle break in my kit and had to replace half the gear because of the smell. Waddling out to bat smelling like an oil refinery.

1014 2018-03-28 21:29:44 Well, not too useless. If anything, it's confirmation of d Western conspiracy and dishonesty. There's oil to benefit from. So anything to end the war. From slavery through colonialism to neocolonialism, West has remained the same: compromise morality for economic gains - @Balatic

1017 2018-03-28 21:29:31 I’ve started using garlic in my magic act. 
I start by crushing it, adding some basil and pine nuts and then I blend them with some parmesan and olive oil and, hey, pesto!

1023 2018-03-28 21:28:41 for the first part, I certainly agree, the foreign ministry is trying to appease Erdogan when he has proven to be almost an enemy 

the 2nd part isn't really to do with Armenia so much as Azerbaijan having oil and being close to Iran.
1024 2018-03-28 21:28:15 Greasy oil companies work Andrew Scheer and his Reform Partiers like a monkey on a stick to make Canadians get their backyards and First Nations lands dug up for private private corporate tunnels to send tar pit  bitumen abroad. Sounds like a lot of jobs for lawyers. #cdnpoli
1025 2018-03-28 21:28:11 NNPC can not give account of our oil revenue hence the federal and accounts allocation committee did not hold. Robbing us blind.
1026 2018-03-28 21:27:59 Cant we have one more oil painting...this is a perfect pick for 45.
1027 2018-03-28 21:27:40 We need far more civil disobedience against oil companies and an uncaring society.
1028 2018-03-28 21:27:36 Commercials being net short, extreme long positioning by hedge funds, $XEG.TO death cross, $XLE ain't buying the rally either, oil is mostly empty hot air pump story to me
1029 2018-03-28 21:27:27 If any of you have been damaged by thinking of Michael Gove in a leopard print tanga covered in baby oil and Paco Rabanne with a chunky medallion adorning his perma-tanned chest, the Daily Mail's complaints editor has an e-mail address.
1030 2018-03-28 21:27:13 Errrrr so men and women present differently................. but the expert can’t tell us how!! I’ll be selling snake oil from the back of my wagon later if any ones interested lol!! #areyouautistic

1033 2018-03-28 21:26:10 “Ha.. I guess technically I did.” She can’t help but laugh in response, biting at her lower lip. “Thank you, I appreciate that. Apart from changing my oil, I’m pretty useless at car stuff.”

1036 2018-03-28 21:25:51 Where has all the oil gone?
1037 2018-03-28 21:25:41 Sunflower oil, Maracuja oil, marula oil, rosehip oil, grape seed oil, almond oil, jojoba oil...
1038 2018-03-28 21:25:41 Other than OH resist at 66.6 (lol) what your thesis short oil?
1039 2018-03-28 21:25:39 This is ‘hippy’ stuff but have a look online for essential oil blends. There’s one I can’t remember the name of but it comes in like a little roller ball bottle and it has like lavender and peppermint oils in it. A girl I used to work worth used it on me once and oh my god
1040 2018-03-28 21:25:30 In 2005, I bought a 2000m2 stand which was taken from me by the ZANU pple. & the same day it happened, century bank was closed with my $$$$. 2 yrs later, the money that could have built me a 5 roomed cotage managed to buy me 750 mls cking oil, a green bar of soap & 500g salt only
1041 2018-03-28 21:25:30 @thedavidcrosby there is a great, all natural aid for sleeping; Serenity Essential Oil Blend from doTERRA.  You should look into it-we use it in our household every night for both children and adults.  Cheers!
1042 2018-03-28 21:25:26 I won't go to the other extreme and claim that MBTI is snake oil - I'm just saying it has a very poor structural relationship with the things it wants to predict.

1046 2018-03-28 21:24:25 Oil money would like a word with you
1047 2018-03-28 21:24:23 probably because they have been reading your ridiculous rants and think that`s the way to go--or they are worried about America pushing them off the OIl table.. OR, maybe they have invested heavily in wind + Solar and are buying their way out.
1048 2018-03-28 21:24:16 Yes, but do they contain Palm Oil from the forests of SE Asia that is being devastated & expelling the Oran U Tans out of their habitat?
1049 2018-03-28 21:24:14 Apply product containing castor oil to eyebrows to stimulate hair growth and promote thickness.

1052 2018-03-28 21:23:58 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.
1053 2018-03-28 21:23:46 Few can. 
1054 2018-03-28 21:23:23 It is so annoying! It makes me want to chop all my hair off lol. But thanks for the suggestions! I’ll definitely be getting some coconut oil 
1055 2018-03-28 21:23:20 @holland_barrett Why do so many of your supplements like pumpkin seed oil tablets have to contain gelatin, as a vegetarian it is impossible to buy from you !
1056 2018-03-28 21:23:15 Golan Heights belongs to Syria and not Israel. Someone better tell Dick Chenney he is losing his drilling license for oil in the Golan.

1058 2018-03-28 21:23:09 Something is terribly wrong with UN. You have the British govt and their jihadists slaughering daily,  Biafra Jews and Christians in West Africa to steal oil and you are worried about "Monkey Chants in a football". SAD.
1059 2018-03-28 21:23:07 Tomato recipes:
Overlapping slices of tomato, mozzarella cheese, & avocado. Sprinkle with a dressing of olive oil and black pepper, and garnish with basil leaves.
Greek salad combine chunks of tomato, cucumber, and feta cheese with black olives and sliced red onion.
1060 2018-03-28 21:22:25 Journalists gloas over technical details; film at 11.  Yet: "To be crystal clear, I’m not arguing that Cambridge Analytica and Kogan were innocent.". He's arguing that CA sold snake oil anyway so it doesn't matter they handled stolen data.
1061 2018-03-28 21:22:17 Saudi Arabia has always been investing in things for after the end of oil - in the UK, its either owned by Russia or SA - but of all places to take advantage of solar power would be SA
1062 2018-03-28 21:22:11 Don't agree poverty means poor results. I lived for years in a developing, oil rich country. Poor students in slums were motivated to study because they understood this was the way out of poverty.

1099 2018-03-28 21:16:43 I would suggest coconut oil or argon oil (again careful bc it can leave your hair greasy) even use coconut oil as a hair mask. Leave in for 1hr with a shower cap or plastic bag then wash it out
1100 2018-03-28 21:16:36 #100WaystoMaketheWorldBetter Use reusable water bottles. Each year, Americans buy more than 29 billion bottles of water, which requires 17 million barrels of oil to make. That’s enough to keep a million cars going for a year!

1117 2018-03-28 21:15:02 We should continue to withhold  the heating oil until an agreement is signed
1118 2018-03-28 21:14:56 a middle-class working people tax break that's what the line Republicans told you. And the oil companies are getting richer. And you are seeing now hikes in fuel for your car in the Bay Area it's over $3 and the rich get richer off of your working backs vote Democrats
1119 2018-03-28 21:14:41 In related news, the COLLUSION between the GOP + Oil & Gas Industry has inexplicably resulted in our EPA disseminating CONTENT-BASED PRIOR RESTRAINTS that touch and concern SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS affecting Global Warming in FLAGRANT VIOLATION of the First Amendment.

1123 2018-03-28 21:14:11 I thought about baby oil, but I didn't want to mess it up lol. Thank you!
1124 2018-03-28 21:14:02 a real game changer. Dollar up, gold down, oil down. Petro YAWN and dollar still hegemoaning.
1125 2018-03-28 21:13:57 Check head n barrel fasteners...looks like base gasket letting by abit..though could be oil from exhaust.. ive not been further than 30 miles on mine yet
1126 2018-03-28 21:13:55 If you like a lot of olive oil on your profiterole, join our club!
1127 2018-03-28 21:13:39 I felt so violated even looking at the page for the show. Yet strangely intrigued! Oh no! Their chimookaman magic is seducing me! Quick! Someone get the anointing oil!
1128 2018-03-28 21:13:37 yeah I use the muffin tins for mine now last time I used shallow ones oil went everywhere XD
1129 2018-03-28 21:13:26 I am sure. Look, as my gramma used to say, I’m no oil painting these days, but who cares? I certainly don’t. There’s a certain power to that.
1130 2018-03-28 21:13:25 Origins charcoal mask, origins fruit enzyme peel (good for texture), and a good vitamin c and/or e oil for moisture and fading acne masks/redness. For toner I like thayers, it’s super affordable. And Mario Badescu rose water spray!
1131 2018-03-28 21:13:07 @mizalyse obviously, you have investments in hemo oil. Fine. But, please do not use the hashtag #OpiodCrisis to sell your product because this is a real battle, and we don't need anything out there suggesting that #CPP don't need thier medication. #marijuana only works for some.

1133 2018-03-28 21:12:43 Unfortunately, the end might be near for the little Kia Soul. The transmission started slipping on Monday, and the oil analysis says that there is significant mechanical wear. On a normal tranny, there should be 72ppm of iron, on mine, it's 572 ppm. 149 instead of 22 of aluminum
1134 2018-03-28 21:12:43 More like our water oil ratio is now to the point where we have to do something!
1135 2018-03-28 21:12:40 Becca is over here drenched in sunscreen w a new sunburn every day & im over here w oil on and no burn 
1136 2018-03-28 21:12:34 Like Western/Russian armed forces, then... oil wars and arms sales - see also Saudi genocide of Yemenis. I don't think those Typhoons are for tehir "red arrows" equivalent. I've met a lot of Muslims - none worried me like the far-right bigots who enjoy making their lives a misery
1137 2018-03-28 21:12:24 Chop onion, chop garlic, fry in a bit of olive oil. Add quorn mince, tin of chopped tomatoes/passata, beef stock cube, frozen mixed veg. I often chuck in a bit of mustard or Worcester sauce as well 
1138 2018-03-28 21:12:18 Use cookin oil. Good for edges
1139 2018-03-28 21:12:01 I was just multitasking eating supper while my son had practice watching the Oil game and running the megathread 
1140 2018-03-28 21:11:34 can i use an oil and glycerin
1141 2018-03-28 21:11:21 put coconut oil on your scalp & roots before you do it
1142 2018-03-28 21:11:18 England has mismanaged Scotland's oil ever since it was discovered
1143 2018-03-28 21:11:17 Planned to get an oil change today, not anymore . Lol I’ll do it tomorrow.
1144 2018-03-28 21:11:06 Data is the new oil!
1145 2018-03-28 21:11:00 & huge subsidies to big oil! Dems. r like Repubs.! Few represent us, 85% r corrupt & 4 big money & corp. donors. 70+% want 1 payer health & at town halls u hear I am 4 accessibility, that means 4 insurance 2 b available & if u can't afford it 2 bad! Subsidies could pay 4 SPHC!
1146 2018-03-28 21:10:31 No more government funded oil paintings we have broke through folks
1147 2018-03-28 21:10:26 The good thing is that eggs can be experienced in so many ways My preference is to see this lot boiled and scrambled preferably in hot oil (I am a pacifist)   
1148 2018-03-28 21:10:16 they know they can get cheap solar panels from China (they have warehouses full of them) and sell oil at a better margin (while oil is still allowed to be sold)
1149 2018-03-28 21:10:07 いや…ちょ、やめろっ！耳からはさすがに油飲めないから！
1150 2018-03-28 21:10:07 Vitamin E oil is the best thing ever
1151 2018-03-28 21:09:58 Well .80 to 1.04 5v5 points per game is a better way to look at it. I will let you decide who has what number. Leafs clearly a better team but to say these 2 are equal is crazy. If Toronto had McDavid they would be top of the league if Oil had Mathews same position or worse
1152 2018-03-28 21:09:51 Go head and flourish Ms.  Coconut Oil
1153 2018-03-28 21:09:46 What about it!! I have Sahara dry skin I usually mix my concealers with a bit of oil to smooth it out. I haven’t tried this yet, what about it made it not work? Thanks for helping a girl out 
1154 2018-03-28 21:09:38 The seas surrounding Guyana are under threat by big oil companies.   We believe that the Government of Guyana is putting the natural world  and our common home in danger.
1155 2018-03-28 21:09:04 You can also just use a clean face towel and switch it every couple of days. I will send you the picture of the face wash I use when I get home! I highly recommend exfoliating beforehand, I always use my face loofah to clear my pores then apply the tea tree oil face wash
1156 2018-03-28 21:08:40 Yes, such a waste. It’s not like we’re going to spend $30M on an unnecessary military parade. We need to choose our battles; I guess the oil painting lost.
1157 2018-03-28 21:08:36 More Corporate Welfare For Big Oil And Gas Folks!! Not Right To Put Them First While Families Go Wt/Out!!
1158 2018-03-28 21:08:08 Frozen strawberries+blueberries, banana, kale, spinach, arugula, chard, almonds, supergreens, freshly ground black pepper, red pepper, cinnamon, honey, red reishi, almond milk, lemon juice, peanut butter, high DHA-fish oil, extra virgin olive oil, sunflower oil, and chocolate
1159 2018-03-28 21:07:57  you mad you ashy lol you used coconut oil today?
1160 2018-03-28 21:07:51 data is the new oil, baybeh
1161 2018-03-28 21:07:46 Not averse to initiating positions once price action and breadth begin to improve. Oil looks far more constructive than the energy stocks. Perhaps surprising, but when something isn’t behaving the way it should given what we know, it’s possible we are the ones missing something.
1162 2018-03-28 21:06:54 Where the oil fields at fuck it
1163 2018-03-28 21:06:47 Gotta get back on my olive oil diet..

1170 2018-03-28 21:05:45 @Budget my husband and I rented a car through one of your Vegas locations. The first is dirty, the second one doesn't have a license plate. We are heading out of town for a family emergency and on the display is "6% remaining oil life". We are told to swap it out in Barstow,
1171 2018-03-28 21:05:42 @BiscuitGeneral i saw today that you are carrying pennents, may I suggest working local with Midnight Oil print and design? (And maaaaybe an Argyle Street pennant)
1172 2018-03-28 21:05:40 Put coconut oil on my eyelashes and eyebrows 
1) it reminds me of Spain and now I've got holiday blues 
2) it's made me on and off blind for a few hours now 
Don't know if it's been worth it

1177 2018-03-28 21:05:00 Not every car needs Mobil1. Check the number on the cap (in most cases) and buy the correct viscosity of your preferred brand. Why spend 10k to kill your car when all you might need is a 4k oil.

1179 2018-03-28 21:04:47 Tea Trea Oil facewash literally saved my face. I used to have terrible cystic acne and once I cut 90% of dairy out of my diet and cut all sodas, the transformation began

1184 2018-03-28 21:03:48 I need a boyfriend willing to massage my scalp with peppermint oil 
1185 2018-03-28 21:03:46 When you write "this is the beginning" it's both true and rich at the same time. The mere advent of EV is an existential threat because the oil business like all extractive industries must have growth, and wilts on stasis. Rich, because few will trust these very real beginnings.

1187 2018-03-28 21:03:41 Won’t this be a good thing by decreasing demand for oil and more investment in solar? I see how this rattles US energy markets and devalues the $ but then shit let’s go full throttle on solar/wind...
1188 2018-03-28 21:03:40 Okay I did that... what type of oil do you use?  I used olive, which probably isn't correct but all I had since I don't use the canola or vegetable oil anymore...but I will for these!  Get a small bottle anyway.

1193 2018-03-28 21:03:14 So I've had a problematic nose piercing for many years now. I'm mindblown by how quickly a combo of crushed aspirin pastes and tea tree oil have resolved my troubles. Thank goodness for the internet.
1194 2018-03-28 21:03:14 Nevermind. You sell hemp oil and seem to offer it as a means to unburden us from the shackles of opioids. The problem is that they ARE ripping people off meds and the alternatives do not help extreme chronic pain.
1195 2018-03-28 21:03:12 somebody was talking about having a scalp massage with peppermint oil and I think I would reach nirvana if somebody did that to me

1203 2018-03-28 21:02:36 I swear it's such a good feeling when you get an oil change, and they don't mention any problems! My lil lady bug .....oh and they washed her too! We riding cute now 
1204 2018-03-28 21:02:28 We could cover you in oil so I could just slide you around 
1205 2018-03-28 21:02:26 Does this curtail your burnt orange spray-tan oil expenditures as well? Asking for a friend. . .
1206 2018-03-28 21:02:17 I love this new world of leaks, it peels back the curtain for us and we get a peak inside what’s really going on

1207 2018-03-28 21:02:08 Day 2 of the cbd oil. Only taking 1/2 the full dose. Nothing to write about just yet. Benenox is still helping me sleep much better though. #recommended

Hope you did well. Next 1000 trades.

1217 2018-03-28 21:01:05 exactly. but my assumption is also based on the fact that the obama approach (an app for supporters to learn who of you friends is still not registered/undecided) is much more effective than the obvious snake oil cambridge analytica is selling.
1218 2018-03-28 21:00:42 A number of ways. But essentially spending more than you earn. Scot gov based spend figures on projected oil price ($113 remember), and froze CT to buy votes = deficit increase. I keep saying its the level of deficit thats the problem. Higher borrowing, higher interest charges.

1227 2018-03-28 20:59:55 Of course, it’s a about finding the right balance. People often forget that  has many agricultural products in huge demand around the world.  whisky was 1.3% of the total value of all  good exports in 2016 (including oil!). 
1228 2018-03-28 20:59:49 Fucked around and put apples (sauteed w. onions in olive oil & garlic) in my corn chowder. Good choices.

1240 2018-03-28 20:58:21 most Italians use olive oil to boil pasta
1241 2018-03-28 20:58:20 Needless to say, the OECD entered the domain of avoided oil demand growth many years ago, probably 20 years ago. EV represent the next hit on top of efficiency gains, changing commuter patterns, and all the other factors that have led to a halt or decline in per capita oil use.

1248 2018-03-28 20:57:28 I think it’s disrespectful for our “government” to allow ppl who have risk their lives to fight for corporate profits/oil/natural resources to ever want for a home, food to eat, or adequate and timely medical care. But that’s my bleeding heart

1255 2018-03-28 20:56:50 They advertise to Joe Republican. The lobbies buy general "oil/gas/coal is good" ads on Facebook and the like.

1291 2018-03-28 20:53:10 UK White nationalist and snake oil salesman finds political gain from kids dying. Cool.
1292 2018-03-28 20:52:55 This is precisely why I'm writing "Oil Fall" this year, because the broad metrics habitually used in oil market analysis skew unhelpfully towards words like "obituary, crash, or decline" when very real action at the margin--as you illustrate--skews towards another word: erosion.
1293 2018-03-28 20:52:54 Plater stood in for Haydon who crashed bad at snetterton taking out dean Thomas?saw plater at second visit to oulton in 06,good shout oil 
1294 2018-03-28 20:52:53 Numbers for the Tesla 3 coming soon. Can't hide behind your bullshit much longer asshole. @elonmusk $TSLA #Tesla No more snake oil.
1295 2018-03-28 20:52:51 There are many refineries that want our oilsands crude, and they are proven reserves. As conventional oil gets harder to find we will need to refine oil sands. We are already losing about $15 billion/yr to the US. Approx $26/barrel differential because we can't sell abroad.
1296 2018-03-28 20:52:50 3) In boom periods, we have to pay top dollar for civil servants or they will work in the oil industry and make a lot more money. The sooner the boom/bust cycle ends, the better it is for everyone.

1298 2018-03-28 20:52:31 ok that’s different, the oil contains enough “flavor” not to need salt, but people that cook without using salt are just crazy IMO
1299 2018-03-28 20:52:21 Is it bad if it’s in a product (like the boscia cleansing facial oil) or is it bad when its one of those DIY things where you apply it straight to the face with some witch hazel

1302 2018-03-28 20:52:08 @theiangleason I have something that will help you w/thrush. -swabbing the mouth area with pure, virgin coconut oil several times day and application of a dilute concentration of apple cider vinegar, tea tree oil, or essential oils to the involved areas.
1303 2018-03-28 20:52:08 Coconut oil is key
1304 2018-03-28 20:51:55 Listening to music on my phone then it connects to my car and the guy doing my oil change just starts staring at me crazy..
1305 2018-03-28 20:51:24 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
1306 2018-03-28 20:51:17 So how do Canadians fix that? Address issues related to climate change. Income inequality. Creating jobs outside of the oil industry. etc..... #TheFuture

1313 2018-03-28 20:50:36 Meanwhile, here in Las Vegas, gas prices are climbing at a rate of nearly 10 cents per week.
So glad we gave Big Oil a welfare check to get them through these tough times.
This is how they say 'thank you.'
1314 2018-03-28 20:50:18 Well, kinda. It depends. Which economic models? And growth in what? I assume you mean growth in energy demand (oil, electricity ?)
1315 2018-03-28 20:49:53 Long overdue for an oil change with all the driving I do

1331 2018-03-28 20:46:47 I'm betting you can't tell me why your predecessor leathernecks spent WWII in the South Pacific if it did not involve control of the oil supply to begin with. History did not start with your birth.

1341 2018-03-28 20:45:44 It’s actually called @bumbleandbumble Surf infusion. It’s a little oil and salt spray. For waves and sheen. You can spray it in after shampoo and conditioner and hand styled or blow dry.
1342 2018-03-28 20:45:29 They killed Gaddafi because he wanted to change his currency to gold. That would make buying Libya’s oil based on the current gold prices
1343 2018-03-28 20:45:20 Oil prices fell about 1 percent on Wednesday after data showed  U.S. crude inventories unexpectedly rose 1.6 million barrels last week,  weighing on market sentiment.

1349 2018-03-28 20:44:55 Sometimes I recreate a period a little over 100 years ago. A little time travel to talk with my ghosts. The gentle crackle of the fire, the glow of the oil lamps just enough to bring Hecate out of the corners.
1350 2018-03-28 20:44:48 On to the real final round. Keep the oil bath bubbling.

1354 2018-03-28 20:44:08 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.
1355 2018-03-28 20:44:00 unfortunately your view through the slit in your blinders prevents you from seeing a larger picture and understanding how direct or indirect control of the world's oil supply is and has been a major factor in our foreign policy for over 100 years. You missed 1974 for example.
1356 2018-03-28 20:43:35 I think you will find that this was the norm before basslink was constructed. We had an oil fired power station at Bell bay for many years that almost never ran due to expense.

1377 2018-03-28 20:40:17 Hey, no problem - glad to help.  The big thing with tight oil or gas plays is the perm is so low that each fractured portion tends to function as it’s own reservoir.  That’s also why they can go in later and refrac some of the early wells
1378 2018-03-28 20:40:17 Could be petoleum coke, which is difficult to get rid off. It comes from mixing heavy oil with condensates. Heavy oil has more asphaltenes.

1386 2018-03-28 20:39:08 That is absurd. Data from film & video are not remotely the same.  Pixels and grain aren't even close.  That is like saying that oil and water color are the same because you can make a painting with both.  I work with much more video than film, but am at least honest about facts.

If you ever find yourself going into preterm labor and it stopped with medications I highly recommend using lavender oil too just rub 1-3 drops on your belly it helps relax your muscles. I’ve been using it for a day and a half and have only 2 contractions
1407 2018-03-28 20:35:05 I’ve been waiting on an oil change for over an hour. What’s the hold up you might ask? They broke another cars dipstick off and can’t get it fished out. I am full of confidence.
1408 2018-03-28 20:35:00 Western investment in Iran would probably be in oil and infrastructure projects. Can probably not be pulled out as easily.
1409 2018-03-28 20:34:48 Its only because American is behaving like a dictator of the world...using Saudi Oil money and getting steady supply of jihadists from Pakis to attack other countries...World is done...I only see 2 world democracies ..one is america and australia...really??

1416 2018-03-28 20:33:50 Oil is ONE mean of production, important but one in the end. 75 enterprises aren't all that exist in Norway, there are more. And 67 % of people have private ownership of stock. That CAN'T be a socialist country until those are completely eliminated or the start to do so.
1417 2018-03-28 20:33:33 Half of that %74 is desert n/t but sand
Definetly not agricultural lands &/or oil/gas fields

1431 2018-03-28 20:29:55 That’s only half the story, as more countries start accepting yuan for oil, you’ll see the price stabilise higher driving up the cost of everything as the surplus dollars go home to roost.
1432 2018-03-28 20:29:49 It’s all in the oil.

1437 2018-03-28 20:28:57 @DonBraid your opinion in the Calgary Herald may do more damage than good. Everyone knows oil is needed, stop beating it. The oil companies need to up their game. Safer pipelines and more accountability. That is why Northern Gateway failed. No accountability and horrible record.

1440 2018-03-28 20:28:38 Reading the CNBC news story, it appears to me that oil companies have probably figured a way to make money from the #climate scare, so they had no scientists to "defend" their position, and instead sent one lawyer, who immediately conceded to the #AGW narrative. It's all about $$
1441 2018-03-28 20:28:26 Yep, sandpaper then oil for the bat

1443 2018-03-28 20:27:57 Creme of nature moisturizer, she’s moisture curl enhancing smoothie... anything on the thick and creamy side && I recommend using either olive oil or some Shea butter to seal it after the moisturizer 
1444 2018-03-28 20:27:43 I made a mistake. It is machine oil. But just as dirty.
1445 2018-03-28 20:27:34 You know the fact that the Iraq war was an illegal one is a widely accepted view by all aspects of society? You made a point there, however, OIL. What do you think motivates the US and UK more than anything. Bush and Blair lied, that is established fact.

1448 2018-03-28 20:27:10 I don’t think the US government wants the price of oil to rise more—it is already hurting consumers. The producers might, but not the government. Of course, they don’t want it to go down too much either.
1449 2018-03-28 20:26:43 Introduce carrot oil to your skin care routine and thank me later.
1450 2018-03-28 20:26:34 Cheers. Was keen to see if the oil would hit temp but no issues there. Checked with the @etiltd Thermapen and it was ready in 10mins or so. Really enjoyed this one again. My only change would be a crustier baguette for some crunch.
1451 2018-03-28 20:26:23 I love how peppermint oil makes my scalp feel 
1452 2018-03-28 20:26:06 I guess it’s the one of the ways they can assure their oil stocks continue to rise. That and make it difficult for renewables. 
So foul and corrupt.

1458 2018-03-28 20:25:05 So I’m outside and I’m getting set up for a nice time sun bathing. I got the coconut oil some music and water about to get to business when the pest guy comes in my backyard to spray. I’m hurt. It’s my one day off and I wanted to get cooked like a chicken!!

1474 2018-03-28 20:22:59 UNLESS....unless, you're supposed to be mixing the THC Oil (coconut oil) every time you use it, and if you DON'T (as I've been doing) all the THC floats to the bottom...that's why I'm more stoned off 1 ml than 4 times that amount a week ago.

1490 2018-03-28 20:20:44 I agree 100%. I only looked it up to share on FB because I know others there would have, so I thought I would share it here too.

1523 2018-03-28 20:16:09 When we think about oil we think about energy, power, money ... even war... when we think about data ... it's almost everything.
So indeed, data is not the new oil it's  so much more.
1524 2018-03-28 20:16:08 State law still requires it to be in oil or lotion form and under 3% THC but yeah slowly getting there.

1537 2018-03-28 20:14:25 Is that because the new oil is crypto-currencies?
1538 2018-03-28 20:14:18 Okay so I’ve never been a stoner EVER and don’t really fancy it tbh but people say that this cannabis oil from Holland and Barrett’s gives u a naughty sleep.. what’s the crack? Is it good or not?
1539 2018-03-28 20:14:15 I'll assume you're being intentionally oblique here, and that you know there are ongoing debates between UNFCCC parties and civil society groups about the conflicts of interest oil companies hold as observers and the lack of a clear process for defining them

1544 2018-03-28 20:13:29 I have friends too who have found the benefits of cannabis oil over cancer treatment and are still going strong. Well done to Carol for her positivity in such difficult situations

1549 2018-03-28 20:12:28 Was there an #AMLO effect on yesterday's oil & gas auction in #Mexico? Stay tuned for the latest @IOA_Energy #Podcast on that very topic.
1550 2018-03-28 20:12:18 David, Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly Oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off Buildings. Pls tell @PrideWinnipeg how u rationalize obstructing  Gay friendly Oil while enriching Gay killing oil

1552 2018-03-28 20:11:38 The two have nothing do to with one another
1553 2018-03-28 20:11:24 And a lot of energy, if an oil rich nation like Saudi is investing in renewables it must be a sign people are listening
1554 2018-03-28 20:11:24 Oil slick

1557 2018-03-28 20:11:08 is there much difference between point and figure and market profile? im saying this as someone who has no experience of pnf charting
1558 2018-03-28 20:11:00 That can & happen anywhere; ppl find a way to exploit systemic weaknesses to embezzle, extort, defraud.. That’s analagous to predation; it’s just systemic financial predation. It’s not unique to HBCUs. However, when it’s at an HBCU, it’s obviously magnified 100x. Oil immersion.
1559 2018-03-28 20:10:51 Had the same issues a few years ago. Buy some lavender oil and spray a little on your pillow. Honestly works and helps you relax when trying to sleep!

1567 2018-03-28 20:10:08 Trump continues to lead from behind. Throttling our most innovative & American company, Amazon, while propping up steel, oil & coal. That is not the future, sir. Technology is.

Personal vendetta against Bezos, owner of Trumpian nemesis @washingtonpost ?

1569 2018-03-28 20:10:00 right. you cld live right next to a lovely garbage dump, water treatment plant, or a oil refinery for an affordable amnt 
1570 2018-03-28 20:09:45 She has even tried the manager at executive offices - basically any number she can try, she has. First it was the head gasket leaking oil, then the oil pump, the clutch, then short block, now it won't start at all. It's ridiculous not to mention #badcustomerservice #Hyundai
1571 2018-03-28 20:09:32 make sway change your oil
1572 2018-03-28 20:09:28 I've served you, you've never given me so much as we've served you, you've never poured oil on our hinges; but she came to
1573 2018-03-28 20:09:15 When you go in for an oil change and 1,000,000 other things wrong with your car 
1574 2018-03-28 20:09:12 It is estimated that each year oil & gas companies waste $330 million-worth of perfectly good natural gas through the harmful practices of venting and flaring as well as leaks on public lands. Tell @SecretaryZinke that Ohioans deserve their fair share of royalties. 
@cutmethane
1575 2018-03-28 20:09:11 Ok so my entire house has smelled like tea tree oil all day and I figured it was just because I didn’t close it all the way last night but I just went into the bathroom and the whole. Entire. Thing. Leaked from a crack when I dropped the bottle a few days ago.
1576 2018-03-28 20:08:49 There is tremendous variation in the composition of yarrow oil. Thus far though, about 102 compounds (yes, that’s over 100 compounds) have been found in the oil.
1577 2018-03-28 20:08:47 Not to mention insurance,tires, oil & maintenance!
1578 2018-03-28 20:08:46 Bravely murdered or injured about 150 people.

She *should* be flayed alive and dipped in boiling oil.  That would be justice.
1579 2018-03-28 20:08:20 Feeling like a real natural hair guru now. I just made a hair growth oil mix of: castor oil, coconut oil, argan oil, sunflower oil, grapeseed oil and olive oil.

Gonna let it sit until sat morning and then I shall use it. It was missing tea tree or peppermint oil, next time tho.
1580 2018-03-28 20:07:58 Anyone have tips on removing oil stains from concrete? I have tried everything Home Depot and a pressure washer can do.
1581 2018-03-28 20:07:55 Looks like Brymo oil..... Nvm
1582 2018-03-28 20:07:51 This was a concocted story to bully Russia and to stop Russia selling its oil in yuan as it will have massive affects on both usa dollar and uk pound. Saddam wanted to sell Iraq's oil in something other than dollar and uk said he had weapons of mass destruction.
1583 2018-03-28 20:07:43 Nice short call on oil after that fire in Germany  Bill..keep that  excellent work  up!
1584 2018-03-28 20:07:39 Ted, after Moore's loss the DNC will target you big time. Have a plan for those "5 mistresses" the media didn't cover during the last primaries. They'll comeback on you this fall.

Oh and Chip....Ted's got Texas oil money in his coffers he ain't even touched yet.
1585 2018-03-28 20:07:35 Third,recent new finds (I.E. off the Shetlands) are too deep and difficult to extract-I.E. the cost of extraction would be greater than the revenue earned from sales of the oil,as experts agreed in a recent repor...

1590 2018-03-28 20:07:02 I hate doing anything car related & being a female. Like getting my oil changed & the salesmen in the dealer trying to get me to buy a car. They all just hounding me with their eyes & finding ways to say something leave me alone.
1591 2018-03-28 20:06:54 I just got finagled into paying $80 for an OIL CHANGE so I am done being an adult until further notice
1592 2018-03-28 20:06:49 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.

1596 2018-03-28 20:06:32 I stay procrastinating on that oil change

1605 2018-03-28 20:05:14 Please tell me that law isn't just for oil paintings....why I feel like there is an acrylic exception?
1606 2018-03-28 20:05:08 Seriously.  Wood bats need sandpaper and oil.
1607 2018-03-28 20:04:58 America is the most generous country in the world.

You will never regret generosity.

We are helping the countries we have destroyed from oil greed.

We are accepting refugees who need our help and are escaping persecution.

We are giving opportunities to people who need them.
1608 2018-03-28 20:04:39 The mighty Oil should rebrand to Team CMD
1609 2018-03-28 20:04:35 The health benefits of Yarrow Essential Oil can be attributed to its properties as an anti-inflammatory, anti-rheumatic, antiseptic, anti-spasmodic, astringent, carminative, cicatrisant, diaphoretic, digestive, expectorant, haemos hypotensive, stomachic and tonic substance
1610 2018-03-28 20:04:27 Also, there's been a general air on a lot of British coverage that CA are essentially snake oil salesmen, and what they're offering isn't really effective, much to the frustration of people who get targeted advertising. Might be worth going into what they DO.
1611 2018-03-28 20:04:15 Ugggh. Had similar feelings when I received a newsletter from Arup crowing about their engineering work building off-shore drilling platforms.  When their sustainability team measures their impact does the oil pulled from the ground go on the other side of the ledger?
1612 2018-03-28 20:04:14 Tea Tree Oil breaks my skin out more I’ve tried it before  I’m just riding it out it’s just annoying to literally look at
1613 2018-03-28 20:04:04 i’m going to buy CBD oil for indy so she doesn’t get any more seizures and for cujo so he gets less stressed at the dog park

1616 2018-03-28 20:03:51 “The United States, with less than 5 % of the global population, uses about a quarter of the world's fossil fuel resources—burning up nearly 25 % of the coal, 26 % of the oil, and 27 % of the world's natural gas.”

1617 2018-03-28 20:03:45 Useing an oil spill that has occurred in a country that doesn't even come close to the regulations and standards we have in BC. 
More fear mongering.
1618 2018-03-28 20:03:31 Why castor oil??
1619 2018-03-28 20:03:22 Donald Trump knows that government spending on Oil paintings is wasteful.  Obviously the funding for Trump’s portraits need to come from non-profit fundraising, like they did twice before from the Trump Foundation.
1620 2018-03-28 20:03:08 It looks like 6 lbs of pubes soaked in week-old fast food fryer oil
1621 2018-03-28 20:02:58 And drink the oil.....
1622 2018-03-28 20:02:57 How has this planet not run out of fresh water & oil yet ?
1623 2018-03-28 20:02:49 Nobody talks about Peak Oil anymore. The 300kg gorilla in the room - too frightening to discuss. And because we don't, we are running out of time. Fast.

1632 2018-03-28 20:01:19 We are going around in circles here. As I mentioned, the views of an oil company like Shell are pertinent, given that oil companies are a major part of the #climate problem and need to submit plans on how to shift to low carbon

1642 2018-03-28 20:00:08 I’m getting an oil change and before I even say a word the guy goes “Oh you’re a Harrigan. Tell you’re mom I’m giving you the A-N-G-E-L-A discount.” rip me I’m known for my mom being cheap

1647 2018-03-28 19:59:39 Which means we should see more pain for oil right?
1648 2018-03-28 19:59:35 I’m only familiar with products for all-over dry hair but you can always just use conditioning masques on the dry parts! I also only wash my hair once every couple-few weeks (I’ve heard that can help your scalp to produce less oil, too, just is a pain to wait it out)
1649 2018-03-28 19:59:34 That’s totally how I am. No one does angst like #Liason but I also love their lighter moments. 20 years of #Liason & I’ll never truly have a favorite scene because they’re all so good! #GH struck oil with #Stecky! #GH55

1651 2018-03-28 19:59:18 It's economics: produce nuclear electricity, sell oil.

The theory that it's all a 20 year ruse to **someday** break out and try to make one nuke before getting hit by 50 is just nonsense.

1672 2018-03-28 19:55:43 Yo, it's about that time. To bring forth the rhythm and the rhyme.
1673 2018-03-28 19:55:41 Thanks. Nice reminder in #wisewords! Though I survived quite some stuff, and hence, the day the #USA will hold their independence higher than oil & money is the day we get our most powerful ally back into reality.  #resist #MakeAmericaRightNow

1684 2018-03-28 19:54:16 Thank you for engaging with me on social media today! You're supporting me in putting off: Applying for jobs, going to the gym, and getting my oil changed.
1685 2018-03-28 19:53:51 In the name of oil men's greed. When will we get off our collective butts and put an end to this thread to all life.
1686 2018-03-28 19:53:49 That synthetic oil ain't cheap especially when you need extra quarts
1687 2018-03-28 19:53:48 I feel this pain. I spilled a cup of olive oil on Sunday.

1692 2018-03-28 19:52:26 usually what happens then is the heel (closest) will produce preferentially over the middle and toe portions.  Having said that, the  permeability of the well is orders of magnitude better than the rock; in light oil reservoirs especially the pressure drop should not be a lot
1693 2018-03-28 19:52:21 You can steam oil at higher temps if you have an espresso machine ! Converts it much faster. But for boiling, I’d say low temp is good, maybe a like 3.5/10 temp, vs like a 2 for stems or flower !

Even the original owner of the tweet admitted it was in error today when I engaged him.

1707 2018-03-28 19:51:00 now that's interesting. One of the comments I heard about the Optare was the steering wasn't great - poor turning circle, felt as though you'd hit oil etc. Seems they have addressed that.
1708 2018-03-28 19:51:00 I think he should apologize to Canadians for claiming to be Mayor of one of Canada's largest 'Shipping Ports', yet actively engaging in the rejection of items HE deems unnecessary for the rest of the Globe, but still vital to Vancouver & Van. Isle....- aka.  ALBERTA's OIL

1716 2018-03-28 19:49:43 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.

1721 2018-03-28 19:48:59 You did this by ketovegan? Because I do not like meat (plus, after a few weeks of initial effort,  I couldn't look at another avocado or tablespoon of coconut oil) and am struggling doing keto because of it. Advice, please?
1722 2018-03-28 19:48:48 Money talks BS walks. That never ending hunger for oil (which powers the War Machine) is the driving force behind the whole war on #Syria. You need oil first to make money and than build or buy tanks. The control of the oil also directs the flow of money in the right accounts.

1739 2018-03-28 19:46:25 Yup
But looking at Col they also have a .913 team save% vs. .894 from last year and a pk unit that is 3rd from 27th last year and those are 2 direct areas McKinnon doesn't impact and we could argue if Oil has those they'd be in too.
1740 2018-03-28 19:46:20 I wish I knew why corporations and governments favoured Islam so much. Canada. The UK. Sweden. Germany. France.
Why do they not only put up with Islam, but favour them in laws and sentencing? Why throw open the borders?
I just don't get it. Is it oil billions being handed out?
1741 2018-03-28 19:46:11 I use @MarioBadescu Oil Free Moisturizer & Control Moisturizer for oily skin during my cycle. I have combo oily skin, that yields more oily than not.

1768 2018-03-28 19:43:14 How about this.. Different formations produce different hydrocarbons. For example the frontier formation produces light condensate the nugget formation produces heavier oil. Different depths and pressures. Has little to do with horizontal length of the casing.
1769 2018-03-28 19:43:09 Pls and please, dear tweeps,do not speak on the matters of Islam if you dnt have authentic knowledge of what you're about to spit out.
1770 2018-03-28 19:43:05 Just earlier, I applied oil onto my sword so it has great sharpness. If you touch it even slightly, your fingers would be cut and blood could spill.

1805 2018-03-28 19:38:11 The economic slowdown was caused by the recession but it was further amplified by the poor policies. The oil prices were much higher in India than the global prices ($132 compared to $90 approx.).
1806 2018-03-28 19:38:08 Well that's obvious #BigData requires energy, but may creat efficiency or better insight. Oil is a source of energy and raw material. A simple Google search will tell you this.

1815 2018-03-28 19:36:58 I disagree. It says "It can cost up to $80 to produce a barrel of oil in Canada’s oil sands, compared to as little as $6 per barrel in Saudi Arabia."
1816 2018-03-28 19:36:46 All States should legalize pot & THC oil. That will do more good than anything.
1817 2018-03-28 19:36:31 Really it’s coconut oil dripping on my face
1818 2018-03-28 19:36:23 you do know (surely) how Paper contracts (derivatives) are used to basically set the desired price of underlying asset, most notably Gold, and Oil to a large extent. Or do we need some references here and maybe get @PeterSchiff involved?
1819 2018-03-28 19:35:51 All your examples of what you called "me burning bridges" was other people burning bridges. I have no interest in Rubin so I'll give you that one. He's snake oil salesman to me. Do you find Matt's blocking me reasonable? I don't think it was.
1820 2018-03-28 19:35:49 Economic instability in Venezuela has taken 800K barrels from their daily production of oil. Venezuela output now 2.4 million barrels  a day
1821 2018-03-28 19:35:42 It seems to me like the discount could be offset by the higher bids customers can potentially offer for your product, but what leads me to this is me analogizing this delivery constraint with blockading an oil chokepoint 

Out of curiosity, does this kind of stuff happen?
1822 2018-03-28 19:35:27 coconut oil for dry skin is a godsend. i cant believe how much it has helped my dry, cracked hands after only one use. 10/10 recommend
1823 2018-03-28 19:35:23 They might be producing nuclear energy to compensate for the oil and fuel embargo--but that's far less interesting that the hyperbole from CBC.
1824 2018-03-28 19:35:15 LOL tarsands. Can't you idiots get anything right? They are oil sands. Alberta's land reclamation in second to none in the World. We have wild bison grazing on reclaimed land

1826 2018-03-28 19:35:12 Mr Pena in one of your interviews  you stated that when Sadan Husain  invaded Kuwait, you stated that Kuwait would not sell there oil stocks they had. Can you tell me why  Just very curious why you knew this would happen.

1831 2018-03-28 19:34:38 Today, tech sells. Before computers, agricultural was pretty much the highest demand before oil and metal proved to be so useful so what are you talking about? And who do you think was doing all the mining?
1832 2018-03-28 19:33:42 @TheJonasKnox The NFL went to change the oil in their Camaro and drove off without the oil filter....BRILLIANT!!!
1833 2018-03-28 19:33:38 More word salad. Look at yearly averages (instead of OPEC propaganda terms like 5 year average). 2017 was higher than 2016. So far in 2018 we are down. But the year isn't over yet so we will have to wait and see that one. But nothing can stop US oil production now.
1834 2018-03-28 19:33:37 Maybe if Mexico was actually going to pay for it as the snake oil salesman pitched in his campaign, wouldnt be as much of an issue....

1857 2018-03-28 19:31:07 Also, globalisation and the internet are eroding national identities, would you argue against those? Would you say Olive Oil is for the Mediterranean and we should stick to beef dripping here in England? Keep our national identity!! None of this fancy continental dilution!

1862 2018-03-28 19:30:41 I’m guessing it must be the oil? Too much grease has me feeling pretty gross.

1878 2018-03-28 19:28:46 Now it all makes sense. Saudi Arabia is an infamously anti-Jewish country. Also, by and large, rich Saudis didn't have to work very hard to get their wealth. They just had to have the good luck to be born upper class in a country that had large oil reserves.
1879 2018-03-28 19:28:40 This is less than 10 miles of a 1900 mile border most of which has similar topography which is proof you are nothing but a snake oil salesman. "Try our Irrelevant Wall cure all"

1889 2018-03-28 19:26:58 One thing that's hard as a single woman is to support certain small businesses that are owned by men. If I get my oil changed at Wal-Mart, they're just going to change my oil. It benefits them in no way to try to scam me into getting more things done like some independent shop.

1919 2018-03-28 19:23:14 They go after an ethically operating small business and ignore the biggest offenders.

1930 2018-03-28 19:21:58 We are getting our products to market but bitumen is not very desirable in a global glut of better-quality oils, which glut was created by the oil industry itself via horizontal drilling, fracking, etc.

1942 2018-03-28 19:20:57 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.
1943 2018-03-28 19:20:56 We can rest assured that these companies will be very adept at becoming big energy rather than big oil. They're planning for it.  The difficulty right now is picking the winners. But a combination of renewables, new nuclear, & hydrogen are on course. They'll spread their bets.

1945 2018-03-28 19:20:44 Point was that because wells are getting longer and longer, they are actually releasing less of the heavier oil the further from the wellhead parts and this is creating lighter oil. The pressure profile along the well has to increase in  pressure to pump the same liquid

1954 2018-03-28 19:19:36 Just had my coffee w/ coconut oil... exciting times ahead 
1955 2018-03-28 19:19:35 to much oil put in tractor.
1956 2018-03-28 19:19:33 true. Torture, boil him in oil and ... chop off every part involved: dick hand head.
1957 2018-03-28 19:19:21 it is sarcasm, while it should be that easy getting local, state, and fed to work together is like asking water and oil not to separate
1958 2018-03-28 19:19:06 And that @SenGillibrand led the push for his resignation with slothful sloganeering (“zero tolerance” “believe women”) – the snake oil of politics, while undermining the ethics process
The press would have had more time had she not pushed to oust him
1959 2018-03-28 19:19:02 おめでとうございます
1960 2018-03-28 19:18:59 It's only learning to assemble a mechanical device. Much like learning how to change a tire or oil on your car.
1961 2018-03-28 19:18:49 Totally agree Harry,  and yet we can't get our products to market to help Canadians. What we do sell is massively discounted. Instead we buy oil and gas from the US, tanker it in from around the world at world prices instead of from our own sources...
1962 2018-03-28 19:18:34  Shama cooking oil
1963 2018-03-28 19:18:34 The Holy oil will stop a urinary tract infection within 20 minutes. I've seen it happen. The Holy oil: virgin olive oil, cannabis, myrrh oil, cinnamon leaf oil and cinnamon bark oil. It's in the BIBLE.

Psalms 23:5
1967 2018-03-28 19:18:17 Probably the same place they stand on pouring waste oil into the storm drain
1968 2018-03-28 19:18:14 Xx. Got the eye drops and omega oil for the food. Will see how he gets in with that x
1969 2018-03-28 19:18:11 $ZN the company said initially we would see a report in a few weeks, now 6 weeks later they are just now sending the equipment to test lol after what 20yrs in biz & no oil they are in no hurry are they
1970 2018-03-28 19:18:07 Cheese? Interesting! I do like mine toasted, and I go coconut oil or peanut butter, but sometimes I have no restraint and eat the whole bun before my hands have time to toast it  how about you?

1972 2018-03-28 19:17:57 Put my beauty blender in a bowl, water and soap as well as oil then put it in the microwave for 1 min
1973 2018-03-28 19:17:56 I've heard that too!! I always meant to try it but never thought to get any when I was at the store lol. I used to use a Garnier shampoo that I didn't like for my hair but worked well for brushes but the oil/soap combo has been my favorite so far!
1974 2018-03-28 19:17:43 Well

1975 2018-03-28 19:17:20 As if the bulk of oil investors could even overestimate EV disruption and underinvest in the status quo.. total denial mechanism.
1976 2018-03-28 19:16:59 I do one of those dry “Italian vinaigrette” salad dressing packets except mixed w pickle juice and a good mustard instead of vinegar and olive oil
1977 2018-03-28 19:16:00 my mother thinks smoking oil is progressive.
1978 2018-03-28 19:15:54 I was hoping it would fix an oil leak, but it hasn’t. Looks to be the rear main seal. 
1979 2018-03-28 19:15:46 Combine 4 tsps jalapeño with 3 cups eel sushi. Mix in Olive Oil. Roast. Serve on bread

1982 2018-03-28 19:15:14 what if the reason that u have to shave ur head for the army is bc the govt wants to extract the precious oil from our hair follicles
1983 2018-03-28 19:15:13 I’m still rollin in my 64 Chevy. I swear to god I use a quart of oil a day. Don’t even get me goin on gas
1984 2018-03-28 19:15:12 @sarah____kent yeah it’s crazy lol I guess the oil industry there is still booming lol and that’s half on the Oilers one
1985 2018-03-28 19:15:05 Did you know, #rapeseedoil is a good source of Vitamin E, which helps maintain healthy skin & eyes, as well as strengthening the immune system  Our oil is also #coldpressed which means it retains as much of the goodness as possible!  #eatwell #eathealthy #eatbetternotless
1986 2018-03-28 19:14:22 Brexit the midnight oil
1987 2018-03-28 19:14:18 @mumgineer1 am I right in my thinking. in a shale oil well due to the horizontal+ multiple points of production. The further from the wellhead either needs to have higher pressure to pump a similar liquid or lower viscosity if pressure along length is similar.
1988 2018-03-28 19:14:17 What should one do if they accidentally put a full pump of Kiehl's Midnight Recovery Cleansing Oil in their eye? Asking for a friend 
1989 2018-03-28 19:14:02 Its going to be beautiful when dotarf shafts her!! 
As he will...as he does..
You know criminals and loyalty, oil and water.
I must admit she is a great liar, if you are into creepy denial and deception.
1990 2018-03-28 19:13:55 I can imagine the midnight oil being burned for this one!
1991 2018-03-28 19:13:48 If your kid has ADHD, you’re def under the sway of big pharma, bro. Get you some essential oils and turpentine. Maybe some coconut oil for your teeth.
1992 2018-03-28 19:13:43 Or just put straight peppers in your food. That's what I do. Or, make your own chili oil.
1993 2018-03-28 19:13:38 "The grooviest and whitest things in the world cannot be fondled or even pursued - they must be washed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
1994 2018-03-28 19:13:36 Even then, the lawsuits may end up just changing the structure of a dying industry away from the oil majors as they have the highest risks due to their disinfo campaigns. Limited CO2 reductions but any settlement funds could go to mitigation or adaptation
1995 2018-03-28 19:13:32 I’m getting an oil change & this fine ass man is working on my car. I haven’t cleaned my car out in like a good 3 weeks yo. He’s all up in my shit. I’m so embarrassed. He must think I’m gross lmao. Water bottles & napkins everywhere. Why am I like that? 
1996 2018-03-28 19:13:27 Hey; geologist here.  The oil comp won’t be changing in the reservoir; I can’t see how that would vary in the pipe - it would fractionate over time then.  We have never seen a change in api versus hz length for any of the plays we are in (SE sask, AB)

1998 2018-03-28 19:13:15 But but but.... they have Oil......
1999 2018-03-28 19:13:04 Oil arrived today, but there is an air block to the boiler. I’ve been at work and then hospital. I’m hoping there is heating & hot water tonight...?!?! 
2000 2018-03-28 19:12:31 That's what I said yesterday. We can't be complacent; we can't laugh this off. Don't go around thinking it'll never happen. They mean to take all of our guns - ALL of them. They can't do it w/out repealing #2A. Stay vigilant. They'll be incremental. Say no to everything.
2001 2018-03-28 19:12:03 The UK's taxes & revenues on the oil producers comes to about 500 billion (still 1.3rd of what Norway got). So where did it all go? Apparently it matches our EU (& its predecessors) membership fees to date ('free trade' is great isn't it).
2002 2018-03-28 19:12:02 My skin was dry a month ago, someone recommended Coconut oil. My skin is perfect
2003 2018-03-28 19:12:01 The way I think about these lawsuits is a low probability, high risk front for the oil companies. Market competition and policy are likely to be more important, but a lawsuit could rapidly accelerate the corporate financial issues that result from reducing fossil consumption
2004 2018-03-28 19:11:56 I followed the debate very closely, acadiana is only region in state with 3 offices for ldwf. We need leaner, smarter,  government, oil biz been consolidating for 2 decades, BLACK Miquez should know this, it works.
2005 2018-03-28 19:11:42 Even if the cases don't make it to trial, the plaintiffs still can gain a lot from discovery, if they get that far. If there are subpoenas for internal docs and deliberations at oil co.s, that could be ammo for future suits or regs.
2006 2018-03-28 19:11:34 Rations, reduced in December, were reduced again in February, and lanterns in the stalls were forbidden to save oil. But the pigs seemed comfortable enough, and in fact were putting on weight if anything. @realdonaldtrump #AnimalFarm
2007 2018-03-28 19:11:27 oooooh now I want one.... That's a quick little bastard....
2008 2018-03-28 19:11:20 It could be the palm oil? A lot of vegans don’t have that, do they?
Or it may be because of the ‘may contain milk’ part of its in the same factory and may be at risk of cross contamination I guess.  how odd!
2009 2018-03-28 19:11:16 10,000 comedians out of work and you’re trying to be funny?  Not an Oil fan or a fan of any team for that matter so don’t care.
2010 2018-03-28 19:10:57 Coconut oil/ water is anti parasite! Will help heal the body & mind 
2011 2018-03-28 19:10:52 出かける用のカバン、リュック使おうかトートバッグ使おうか迷ってる
2012 2018-03-28 19:10:52 Sorry if you all are tired of me talking about my face, but listen, it hasn't even been a week and the texture of my skin has changed so much that my moisturizer is actually sinking into my skin and smoothing it instead of sitting on top of it because of oil production.
2013 2018-03-28 19:10:46 Lots of new treatments out there and alternative medicine(CBD oil/Easter Medicine).
2014 2018-03-28 19:10:45 Brother, please study and believe His Word concerning end times, so you will be ready to wait with enough oil.
2015 2018-03-28 19:10:35 Good, wake up y’all Brother Lives travelling salvation band has dispensed its last snake oil!
2016 2018-03-28 19:10:30 That was a funny call #Brian @andygoldstein05 was absolutely right the worst caller ever
2017 2018-03-28 19:10:29 Na Thas not facts. You can sauté on the grill n they definitely use butter and oil.
2018 2018-03-28 19:10:22 ジルバさんの手品スゲーよなー！
2019 2018-03-28 19:10:20 I can't wait to see what a match in Lucas Oil is like.  Saturday needs to come faster!!!
2020 2018-03-28 19:10:17 Between a mixture of cbd oil, Advil and a muscle relaxant, I've got my migraine under control.
2021 2018-03-28 19:10:09 I buy Organic kernels in bulk from Sprouts, then use organic coconut oil on a stainless steel pot ... mmmm pop pop pop pppOp

2023 2018-03-28 19:10:03 Whoever keeps spraying peppermint oil in the stairwell THANK YOU. Every time I leave the building it’s like descending 12 glorious flights of Christmas
2024 2018-03-28 19:09:58 @USEmbassyGhana AM I SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE THIS JUST LIKE I DID WITH THE WMD STORY THEY THREW AT US JUST TO ATTACK IRAQ AND KILL SADAM IN ORDER TO STEAL IRAQI OIL? When the USA says look up, you better look down. They bombed their own world trade center for their secret interests
2025 2018-03-28 19:09:57 Its the time!,OIL its a limited kind of energy,it will finish.
2026 2018-03-28 19:09:32 That useless player should of donated that out of his own pocket , waste of space going to ruin this city for years to come thanks Pc  #puke

2028 2018-03-28 19:09:27 Ya mcm can’t even change his own car oil let alone a flat tire
2029 2018-03-28 19:09:18 Now Paul leave tommy alone your no oil painting yourself #FairCity
2030 2018-03-28 19:09:16 And your 401k is NOT INVESTED in oil and gas, at all....
2031 2018-03-28 19:09:11 Relax everything is going to be fine. Anything moisturising would do. Even some olive oil or coconut oil at the tips can do wonders *hug*
2032 2018-03-28 19:08:59 Yes down hole and surface pressure, depth, tubing size, volume, choke size, liquid column are all factors. The gravity of the liquid. As gas and oil are depleted from the formation water replaces the void created.
2033 2018-03-28 19:08:58 Agreed but globally the growing demand for vehicles from developing and partially developed countries is a major concern.  How quickly they adopt EVs and how many combustion vehicles will be added to the global fleet will likely dictate the timeframe for oil.
2034 2018-03-28 19:08:55 And try going to Marshall’s! Got a pack of like 4 essential oils for 12$ which is a super good deal! It had lavendar,eucalyptus,peppermint, and tea tree oil in it
2035 2018-03-28 19:08:55 ... So.... YOu are the ONLY one in AMERICA that does NOT USE OIL and GAS?
2036 2018-03-28 19:08:53 you lose so much profit being always negative on oil. 
you need to take up surfing and ride the waves
2037 2018-03-28 19:08:42 What round do you think the Oil will exit this year?
2038 2018-03-28 19:08:36 Argan oil from where?
2039 2018-03-28 19:08:28 How would you like to hear that oil spilled all over your prom dress while getting altered and they don’t know if dry-cleaning will get it out?  hahahaha why does this happen to me 
2040 2018-03-28 19:08:27 It depends how much of the oil you want. I find a spin at the end gets them out centrifugally!
2041 2018-03-28 19:08:25 $TGC in .67 Oil is ripping. Just like $ZN
2042 2018-03-28 19:07:59 I spilt coconut oil on the bed
2043 2018-03-28 19:07:56 Nah kid. To sauté you need a pan and very little oil or butter. You just get regular degular grilled onions
2044 2018-03-28 19:07:49 Exactly. My kids know who gets what, otherwise it would have been wrestlemania.
2045 2018-03-28 19:07:45 Hindus have been kept busy in fighting for livelihood.. while other minorities enjoy alms from oil rich countries... 
Poverty is what they are preying upon and we need to stop it, but for that a very very strong political will is required, which sadly is invisible for now.
2046 2018-03-28 19:07:30 Should I have motor oil for breakfast?
2047 2018-03-28 19:07:26 wait till america found out how much oil loki have in his hair
2048 2018-03-28 19:07:17 All cheap, too. Sardines packed in olive oil are delicious and even better in pasta(but you're team no carb/so that's out)
2049 2018-03-28 19:07:17 I don’t think you can be an oil producer in private tho

2051 2018-03-28 19:06:46 #Occupy: That is right.
I think the reason Sudan helps #Qatar is because they get Oil-$$ for it and for the Smuggle via the Sahara-routes in which they partake. #Egypt cannot raise those amounts.
2052 2018-03-28 19:06:42  it’s like saying oil twice soooo weird
2053 2018-03-28 19:06:35 Makes me respect my wife’s dogged cheapness even more when it comes to keeping our house freezing cold to save on our heating oil bills.
2054 2018-03-28 19:06:35 Oh so NOWWWWW everyone wants to get on the “Alabama Power is tripping” train when it comes to that good oil (ole) water supply... BUT WHEN EVERYONE WAS SPEAKING UP ABOUT THEIR POWER BILL,  IT WAS “YA’LL BE STRAIGHT”
so I say this...
“Boil that water... y’all be straight”

2055 2018-03-28 19:06:32 Agree. It’s like folk have only just realised they are a small club fuelled by oil money. 
FFS, goater is a club legend. He wouldn’t be in our top 500.
2056 2018-03-28 19:06:05 Coal and oil are finite. They will run themselves out. And wind and solar are coming up fast and strong.
2057 2018-03-28 19:06:00 Difficult to imagine the snake oil he will peddle will be any thicker.

2059 2018-03-28 19:04:49 I'm going to go around all the locks in office and oil on them in preparation for the next red team... I have found your weakness!
2060 2018-03-28 19:04:45 Wasn't really looking as saw one on the Liberia side a few years ago! Patrick doing well, he's teaming up with Simon to do the Timneh survey fuelled only with potato leaf and a gallon of palm oil

2062 2018-03-28 19:04:13 But the rationale dovetails with Concho's move.And then there's the oil market itself
2063 2018-03-28 19:03:58 Oil did arrive today. I don’t know what the price is though..... 
2064 2018-03-28 19:03:36 NOTE TO SELF. Don't drink chili oil, ever again.

2069 2018-03-28 19:02:52 I love deep conditioning and putting oil and shit in my hair, I don’t see how girls wear weave all the time I love embracing my natural hair and taking care of it. You can’t really expect your hair to grow just because it’s up under your weave! Honestly good hair takes effort
2070 2018-03-28 19:02:52 Spilled all this damn lavender oil  at work and  I smell just like it 
2071 2018-03-28 19:02:49 smelling oil instead of rain rn
2072 2018-03-28 19:02:44 if you export nothing and after that one barrel of oil you already increased by 100%
2073 2018-03-28 19:02:04 At the ripe age of 21, Charles Murphy Jr. took over Murphy Oil Corporation. Mr. Murphy retired in 1994 with two refineries in the United States and the United Kingdom, and a seat on Murphy Oil's board of directors. #ARCapitalFounders
2074 2018-03-28 19:02:00 Cops risking their lives is the same as lumberjacks, electricians, and oil rig workers--it's their job, and they get paid to do it. No one is forcing them to be a cop.
2075 2018-03-28 19:01:56 Red oil, salt, otazi leaf, fresh onions, fresh or dry pepper

2077 2018-03-28 19:01:30 Ok, so what is your beef with Sam? I got it that unnamed experts somewhere disagree with something he said, I got that. But you compared him to a known fraud. So, what snake oil is he pedaling to me? Or are you simply and asshole trying to score points?

2095 2018-03-28 18:59:59 Time for a spring clean! Toss that aged out cream and get yourself a new face lotion, preferably with sunflower oil to keep your moisture barrier up! #skintip #yyc #loschntip
2096 2018-03-28 18:59:32 The packaging my toasted sesame oil came in is just terrible, it gets everywhere and of course the oil is very fragrant so it’s like I smell like toasted sesame seeds all day 
2097 2018-03-28 18:59:13 Only bad part about getting a haircut im between classes is, that you spend the rest of the day smelling like oil sheen.
2098 2018-03-28 18:59:04 I got tree tea oil in my hair and I’m about to put on a face mask 
2099 2018-03-28 18:59:01 This is what Trudeau wants. He doesn’t want Canada to be an oil exporter???
2100 2018-03-28 18:58:46 Vision 2030, 200 GW of solar, multi-decade oil market management deal with Russia, $500bn Neom investment -- MBS sure has a knack for managing expectations
2101 2018-03-28 18:58:23 @VeganOlive1 Hello, I’m in my 5th week of going vegan and was wondering if you could recommend a nice vegan cheese. I’ve tried ones that are made with coconut oil and I don’t really like the taste.
2102 2018-03-28 18:58:17 10.  Alexander Nix wrote a White Paper profiling how the use of data could assist in the American election.  He presented it to Luke Oil a Russian company.

2104 2018-03-28 18:57:53 Having just consumed my delicious Dig In lunch, complete, with an avocado half, drenched in olive oil, sea salt and freshly ground pepper, I can say that a day without avocado would be a sad day, indeed.
2105 2018-03-28 18:57:51 The busted country has oil so they fine and shit

2112 2018-03-28 18:56:39 Yeah I don't like most of the oily lotions but being that straight up oil helped that might actually be why the lotions didn't help.
2113 2018-03-28 18:56:37 I need some almond oil today but imma wait til Friday to just get everything I need in Huntsville I hate driving up there

2117 2018-03-28 18:56:11 I'm out of oil and I'm not fuckin pumped about it
2118 2018-03-28 18:56:07 Idk what it is soz but in South Africa mafura means fat/oil so it just sounds weird

2122 2018-03-28 18:55:14 Big turn around 24 hours before Brazil 15th oil round as audit court removes from bid two star blocks, with a combined US$1b in signing bonuses. Not a lot of time to review bidding strategies

2124 2018-03-28 18:54:47 YoY and they started exporting oil again
2125 2018-03-28 18:54:33 Why would olive oil be given a red light in any pragmatic labelling system?
2126 2018-03-28 18:54:28 Girl, i needed some of that peppermint oil in my mask

2129 2018-03-28 18:54:20 I've worked from a lot of different places, but working from the waiting room of a ford dealership while my car's oil gets changed has hit a new high... (or low, not really sure).
2130 2018-03-28 18:54:03 Am I the only one who's @JUULvapor pods leak? This thing just shot oil in my mouth and pretty sure I'm dying now #whydoesthishappentome

2132 2018-03-28 18:53:31 i put castor oil in my hair and i already regret it
2133 2018-03-28 18:53:17 Ah I bought some sweet almond oil and rose hip oil so I could make my own thing. I had a skull dropper bottle and wanted a use for it. I originally made it for my face but ended up using it on the rest of my body too. I love it.
2134 2018-03-28 18:53:09 maybe I'll stream one of those playoff games if I discover oil under my patio
2135 2018-03-28 18:52:47 So somebody tell me how gas prices are going up, when we are producing oil like crazy? If you answer is to blame Trump,  just go away. I want legit answers.
2136 2018-03-28 18:52:38 @MEvelyyn_ We hear you there! Have you taken care of the oil change?
2137 2018-03-28 18:52:38 I pulled up to get my oil changed as if I have the money for it like it’s no ones business
2138 2018-03-28 18:52:31 Not for money. Not for oil!
2139 2018-03-28 18:52:12 I smell the dead hand of authority behind this, maybe government, the establishment perhaps or the oil rich middle east Islamic Republics that seem to own almost everything in Britain  #iamtommy
2140 2018-03-28 18:52:02 My biggest fear is that "establishment-type" Dem's will continue to try to box out the Center and Left in favor of Dem's that 50 yrs ago would have been called Republicans. Those who embrace money that comes from slightly better behaved wealthy interests (ie banks instead of oil)
2141 2018-03-28 18:52:00 We do that too but whenever someone uses oil you can tell cuz the noodles stick together in the bags in clumps

2148 2018-03-28 18:51:19 Kevin mentioned the oil fields in Pennsylvania as the place the young men of Garbutt should target.  Not the city. Another sign you haven't actually read the article start to finish.  

FTR, I educated myself by agreeing to serve in the military. No nannies or gardeners
2149 2018-03-28 18:51:15 I think it's actually smart for the oil companies to stipulate they agree with the science - It takes the science out of the equation and focuses the discussion on the legal theory, where they have stronger footing.
2150 2018-03-28 18:51:02 My face feels like a baby, glowing & refreshing. thanks to zari for the bomb facial, brows & oil

2154 2018-03-28 18:50:37 Why doesn’t Alberta just build oil refineries? Extract and then produce a finished product to sell in Canada to Canadians! What am I missing? #bcpoli #yyc #Alberta #oil #BC
2155 2018-03-28 18:50:19 Fast-food chicken joint in Columbia Heights when I was 16. Every day sucked, but one day, a splatter of oil burned my hand. Instead of going home early, they bullied me into staying two extra hours to wash dishes (which really hurt my hand), because my injury had slowed me down.
2156 2018-03-28 18:50:16 Looks like Mr Pump is doing his usual shtick. Wait until pit closes, then take advantage to pump up the price with hope to triggers algorithms
2157 2018-03-28 18:50:12 The future value of oil gets worse every day.
2158 2018-03-28 18:50:10 Did you use the noodles like right as you made them or did you prep noodles ahead of time  cuz if you chill noodles cooked with oil they get sticky and form a slime
2159 2018-03-28 18:50:07 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ!

2162 2018-03-28 18:49:46 If this is a crisis, how does he define wildfires, floods, etc. that are regular occurrences?  Whereas there has, (in over a half century), been no spills from hundreds oil tankers per year in Burrard  Inlet or in the Strait of Juan de Fuca.  He ignores even tougher regulations.
2163 2018-03-28 18:49:39 Went to buy an oil painting online, said it was $120 then I realized it was €120 and with shipping it was $190  feels bad man. I need the equalizer currency to take a stand #cryptocurrency

2165 2018-03-28 18:49:09 bro i’ve always used oil. we used oil at my old job and never had a problem lol
2166 2018-03-28 18:49:05 A known liar joining up doesn't inspire confidence.
2167 2018-03-28 18:49:03 "[This story] is about how technology has been used to subvert democracy from within—not by foreign powers—but by increasingly unaccountable corporate power, including those tied to the rampant exploitation of oil, gas and coal." 

 this is quite brilliant

2170 2018-03-28 18:47:25 It is a blast! It's sensual and erotic because you're slipping and sliding all over each other and I personally love how nudew bodies look covered in oil.
2171 2018-03-28 18:47:23 There will be a new snake oil by then and nvidia will be back to video games
2172 2018-03-28 18:47:15 I'm so sorry for you, but this is the peril of liberalism.  It's a cancer that spreads and eventually kills.  I'm afraid it's too late. You must leave for your safety, apply for asylum.
2173 2018-03-28 18:46:55 Yeah, clove oil rocks! Hope it doesn't hurt too much 
2174 2018-03-28 18:46:55 $ZN is mobilizing equipment to test that well for real oil. What a news! It's arriving from Netherlands without any delays. What a waste  of shareholders' money.  Their press releases are like comedy show scripts.

2191 2018-03-28 18:44:36 Yeah the magnitude of acknowledgement/support for policy is the question. I’m skeptical of lawsuits like this, though can imagine them bringing oil companies to the negotiating table for more ambitious policy, if successful.
2192 2018-03-28 18:44:35 Errr...drinking mineral oil...seems perilously close to cheating

2202 2018-03-28 18:43:48 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.

2207 2018-03-28 18:43:12 Why would anyone want to be Venezuela? Even their dictator isn't doing well. They're oil financed communists and the oil workers went on strike. We will never be Venezuela nor do we want to try.

If I handle u now, u go dey sound like generator wey short oil
2214 2018-03-28 18:42:37 Sure. But oil majors are still members of ALEC (Exxon is on the board), which lobbies against climate regs. That the oil majors have conceded climate science in court when some still contest it in policy is an interesting bifurcation.
2215 2018-03-28 18:42:37 Aside the fact he inked that 8 year so he can request a trade all he want but he locked for 8 if oil wanna be dicks

2217 2018-03-28 18:42:23 @MCaruso_Cabrera please check your teddy roosevelt to see what he said about std oil, steel cos, rails and anti trust prior to the antitrust laws developed and passed. fyi std oil had low consumer prices too - not just amazon.
2218 2018-03-28 18:42:03 (I'm taking the guess it cleared up on it's own because I doubt mineral oil, sweet almond oil, and rosehip oil would be that powerful.)
2219 2018-03-28 18:42:02 70 percent of America did not get a tax break lol so 1.5 trillion we all have to pay for except the rich thiers is locked in and MR and MRS blue collar take it in the backside for 20 years more yeah that sounds about right from this snake oil salesman with a jet.

2223 2018-03-28 18:41:39 Does Snake Oil mix with sour grapes?

2227 2018-03-28 18:41:00 hmmm 
yeah maybe you just need to build a tolerance then
maybe prep with a face oil for an extra layer of protection for your skin?
2228 2018-03-28 18:40:53 homemade remedy. With mineral oil only improving it the homemade remedy cleared up all the scabs in like two uses... I take the assumption the combination of the both must of helped or something changed with me in particular for it to just fuck off on it's own.
2229 2018-03-28 18:40:49 That is nice. More you value cyclists by giving them infra, more ppl cycle and everyone wins, except the car and oil companies.
2230 2018-03-28 18:40:48 When demand for gasoline diminishes. Then the price for it will go down. Leading to other uses for the hydrocarbons that make gasoline. Then there are nonfuel hydrocarbons in crude oil. Which will still need to be produced by pumping more crude.
2231 2018-03-28 18:40:31 What crap. Oil made Nigeria. And it’s not doing too well currently. Also, perhaps Google “GDP per capita Nigeria” you lying despot.

2237 2018-03-28 18:40:11 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
2238 2018-03-28 18:40:05 Coconut oil helps with hunger. Don't eat gobs of it, but buy the supplement gel caps. Three of them have 60 calories, and they actually help.
2239 2018-03-28 18:39:58 harvesting online data es same as harvesting oil, to determine the price-per-barrel. Facebook’s business model is NOT a shocker but it es polarizing.your electronic footprint will always be used to infer your habits by using artificial intelligence algorithms.since from time ago.
2240 2018-03-28 18:39:50 Probably would have gotten better oil also.
2241 2018-03-28 18:39:49 I'm in a mechanic shop and it smells like body odor, motor oil and cis male frustration
2242 2018-03-28 18:39:42 i think i’m 5,000 miles over needing an oil change...

2246 2018-03-28 18:39:04 I loved these, & the perspex desk toys filled with half coloured water, half oil; so much so that I searched recently to see if you could still buy them, but had no luck. Simple pleasures have their place, don't they?
2247 2018-03-28 18:39:00 Just had to spend £60 on oil for my car, this audi life is tough 
2248 2018-03-28 18:38:57 The world is full of despots, many others besides Assad in middle east not paragons of tolerance. It is not about democracy. It is about oil, Israel and rulers faithfull to USA or not. Osama was trained by CIA and pakistan’s ISI together, but the snake turned on the snakecharmer

2253 2018-03-28 18:38:08 DID YOU KNOW! The world’s oldest person,  Jeanne Calment, attributed her ripe old age of 122, to a diet of olive oil, port wine and 1kg of chocolate per week. #WineFacts #DrinkResponsibly #TiffsUnion

2258 2018-03-28 18:36:39 I lived in Santa Barbara since the early 1950's. They had large deposits of beach tar from the many, many, natural oil seeps...until ...drilling relieved the pressure. I noticed that since the drilling stopped, the nasty tar is back as thick as ever. Some days it's really bad.

2260 2018-03-28 18:36:04 IU have been doing “no oil…within reason.” It’s easily avoidable while at home but I’m not going to make a big deal over if I’m out with people.

2263 2018-03-28 18:35:33 Is CBD cannabis oil?
2264 2018-03-28 18:35:33 Yeah, that's the key - we're not dealing with journalists, here. We're barely dealing with snake oil salesmen - that's insulting to charlatans.

2268 2018-03-28 18:35:04 Magee identifies the real issue facing every Cannabis producer, and this is the concentrate factor. Ind. Hemp will produce these as a by-product for costs similar to cooking oil. Whether we like it, or not, this is the baseline price that all other products must be marketed from.

2282 2018-03-28 18:33:48 Oh no! I am so so sorry! That is horrible:( what do they want you to do in the meantime? Can you get your hands on some oil of oregano pills in the meantime? I know it sounds witchy/hippie, but that stuff has worked WONDERS on me for sinus infections/viral stuff both!
2283 2018-03-28 18:33:45 Definition of expert.. an ex is a has been and a spurt is a drip under pressure. Not an expert, but its more of a reservoir question. As the reservoir is depleted the oil could get lighter.

2319 2018-03-28 18:28:05 “It’s time for them to pay for the seawalls ... to protect San Francisco & Oakland.”

What utterly hypocritical nonsense. California's wealth is built on the production and over consumption of oil.

Those ocean front properties now at risk would not exist without it!

2328 2018-03-28 18:27:12 Yes cars (vehicles) are a major pollutant. #delhi is an example. Electricity is generated using coal, oil and nuclear power.. All of them are destroying nature. So why don't you give up electricity ?

2344 2018-03-28 18:24:37 To be clear, I’m not happy about a projected $96 Billion debt, but a substantial debt was UNAVOIDABLE given massive drop in oil royalties and the lack of any saved surpluses from previous strong oil income during the PC’s time in office.

2352 2018-03-28 18:23:24 I usually go to bike washes but those are always a waste of $. I know you can use simple green especially for the chain and stuff but you have to let it soak. Mine is filthy and have grease / oil caked up on it.
2353 2018-03-28 18:23:16 hey everyone who thinks not buying gas on a single day will affect oil companies: it won’t.
2354 2018-03-28 18:22:40 This is great to see. Marine transportation has been adapting rapidly, from the use of #LNG as a marine fuel to curb emissions from traditional heavy fuel oil; to full electrification as we see here. @Corvus_Energy (also ) has been making great waves here (no pun intended )
2355 2018-03-28 18:22:28 We were not threatened by Iraq, Libya, Syria, or Iran.  And all of those countries were happy to sell us their oil.  (We put sanctions on them, not the other way around.)  Most wars are unnecessary.

2357 2018-03-28 18:21:56 A question for the shale experts. Does anybody have a profile of the API of crude oil released along the length of a shale well? Does the crude oil get lighter the further from the pad? Just wondering because the viscosity law for transporting liquids suggest it should.  #OOTT
2358 2018-03-28 18:21:54 3.  A barrel of crude can produce about 0.56 MWh of electricity, but they've go potential for solar under $20/MWh. So they can replace a barrel of oil with about $11.25 worth of solar. And they can export that replaced barrel for about $64.

Penn Grade oil in not tar based and has nothing hazardous in it and should not have to be hauled to a landfill! Democrats have to be objective and not blindly follow things Like the EPA,!
2575 2018-03-28 17:55:04 That a wise man like you is blind to killings happening right? Now the question is are these killings lies? The north wants oil money from South( while it leaves herds men roam untaxed and hide wealth through ownership of cows) wake up sir, am a northern too.

2653 2018-03-28 17:45:40 I mean, she’s still here! She made it past a year with glioblastoma so that’s great! She’s been doing treatments, some medical (Avastin) some holistic (CBD oil, vitamin C, B17 vitamins, healthy eating, etc) So she’s doing well considering.. She’s optimistic & fewer headaches!
2654 2018-03-28 17:45:26 Something I call the #goldentriad for consumers is happening today. #dowjones is up (helping wealth effect), oil is down (lower gas prices) and #10yrtreasury is lower (lower interest rates, mainly mortgages) I like this!

Then Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and everything in it, and so consecrated them.

2658 2018-03-28 17:45:10 Oh yeah this game sure is the definition of insanity xD I was having a standoff in the road with some cultists and a bear ran into an oil tanker and it exploded them all xD
2659 2018-03-28 17:45:10 Dabs are concentrated doses of cannabis that are made by extracting THC and other cannabinoids using a solvent-like butane or carbon dioxide, resulting in sticky oils also commonly referred to as wax, shatter, budder, and butane hash oil (BHO).
2660 2018-03-28 17:44:50 Google is getting broken up like Standard Oil. What’s YouTube’s stock ticker going to be?
2661 2018-03-28 17:44:47 After Air India, sell banks. Then oil companies and then ISRO and rest.
2662 2018-03-28 17:44:44 I've been hung up on and somebody got pissed about us having limited availability for oil changes when they were requesting a same day appointment 
2663 2018-03-28 17:44:35 ตกดึกทีไรปวดหัวทุกที ปวดจนนอนไม่หลับ :(
2664 2018-03-28 17:44:14 U.S EIA inventories: Crude add 1.6 million barrels, Gasoline drops 3.5 million, Distillate down 2.1 million on 92.3 percent refiner capacity. Neutral on further oil price increases as crude build shows its face.
2665 2018-03-28 17:44:06 Yes mam....with Debt servicing of oil subsidy given all these years.... still not coping up with the exact International Oil market prices..Hoping with this new Hydrocarbon exploration licensing policy, situations could change a bit for good
2666 2018-03-28 17:43:59 Haha, aguy baby.  Baby oil
2667 2018-03-28 17:43:54 I don’t understand how girls can keep their foundation looking dewy without getting super greasy. If I ever try a dewy look I look like a dunked my face in a bucket of oil
2668 2018-03-28 17:43:37 I hope your pets are finally feeling better! I'm working on a story about pets and essential oil poisoning, and I'd like to talk to you about your experience. Please feel free to DM me or email at kaitlyn.wells@wirecutter.com. TIA

Rational - Call the police, you've been assaulted. Put him out of your life.
Irrational - Mix his hair moisturizer with Nair. Add oil to his windshield wiper fluid. Put dissolving bleach tablets in his jeans on wash day.

2671 2018-03-28 17:43:21 All these talks about what oil is and isn’t doing. Oil is the Holy Grail. @angela_rye do you know what China has been up to with their crude oil. Planning for dedollarization. Implementing their own petro dollar and about to dethrone America and the almighty dollar. White people!

2673 2018-03-28 17:43:15 ndozvandatofungawo from mdc to zanu is oil and water hapana relation
2674 2018-03-28 17:42:55 I totally disagree. A PST is completely separate from a carbon tax. Unless the price of oil increases significantly, AB may need a PST. Do you really think @jkenney is against a PST?  Has he ever said if elected he would never introduce a PST?
2675 2018-03-28 17:42:50 To be fair, that Range Rover is going to be leaking oil and coolant, have a bad transmission, and have a busted radiator and A/C within a few months anyway, so your kid is coming out WAY ahead of the game. And they’ll WISH they had cranks when their fancy power windows break 
2676 2018-03-28 17:42:48 #potatoes because it is The superfood, the best energy source and you can grow it fast on a small area. #Peanuts for the oil, first to make #fries and second because it is addition to the astronauts diet. Instead of peanuts also sunflowers could provide the oil
2677 2018-03-28 17:42:32 I’m putting caster oil on my eyelashes every night to try make them grow back given up on the lashes for a while to sort them out 
2678 2018-03-28 17:42:29 Rep. @BlakeMiguezLA bringing amendment to HB687 to require that LDWF couldn't use conservation funds to purchase any new office space or buildings for at least 3 yrs. while oil industry bounces back. #lalege
2679 2018-03-28 17:42:25 RT to win a family 4 pack for the Lucas Oil Stadium home opener for the @IndyEleven on Saturday night! @jmv1070 & I will pick the winner tonight!
2680 2018-03-28 17:41:45 Thing that gets me with plastic (made from oil) and all other fossil fuels - they took 65Million years to create. What happens when we run out? 
2681 2018-03-28 17:41:33 Ken Bate's Choice: Me or dirty Russian oil money.
2682 2018-03-28 17:41:25 Lmfaooo my moms boyfriend was really finna pour CANOLA OIL on the floor instead of pinsol  talking bout they look the same 
2683 2018-03-28 17:41:23 The smell of Rosemary oil.
2684 2018-03-28 17:41:09 Pumping oil and powder in the Library wont work #tothemedia
2685 2018-03-28 17:41:03 Moroccan Argan Oil or Coconut Oil
2686 2018-03-28 17:40:52 Good for you! How is that treating you? I can't guarantee no oil, but Chipotle burrito bowls are easy to make plant-based, and largely whole-food. They are my go-to airport food.
2687 2018-03-28 17:40:33 Bolton is the "drain the swamp" kind of guy, look at the reforms he accomplished in the UN during the "oil for food" scandal, because of him the Secretary General  at the time retired.
2688 2018-03-28 17:40:31 おにーさんにまかせとけー！
2689 2018-03-28 17:40:19 Transformer oil ikabiwa unomuisa kupi mukomana wako, or load shedding ikatanga?

2691 2018-03-28 17:40:06 Never understood why ppl are still j***ing off about this. Oil painting is still a thing. It looks different than watercolor or photography. Just because a new way to make things appear doesn't mean one has to go... Film is an older technology and cheaper preservation format, too
2692 2018-03-28 17:39:56 Good night. I should go to bed...
Add oil Sui-senseisupport you!
2693 2018-03-28 17:39:42 Mara could smell the autumn rain still clinging to the cobblestone streets, the decay of the wet leaves piled in carts on the sidewalks, the pungent oil in the street lamps. A riot of colors stabbed at her. It was wonderful, it was too much.

2694 2018-03-28 17:39:36 Got an unexpected bonus in my pay slip today. Not enough to buy another FCKN GUITAR THAT I'D BEEN SAVING FOR 

That's oil tanks for ya 
2695 2018-03-28 17:39:31 Doing a coconut oil mask on my hair will solve all my problems yes or no?
2696 2018-03-28 17:39:02 This seems more like an attempt to snatch up Egypt's tourism industry to replace oil income than any kind of actual reform
2697 2018-03-28 17:38:49 @WorldOil . There are petroleum engineers that are jobless! The Mechanical Engineers are predominant in the oil sector. Please,  why is that? #reply # we need answers.
2698 2018-03-28 17:38:31 I understand the distinction.  What’s the difference? People hardly ever orient their views about policy toward any environmental subject based on their understanding of the subject; the environment is never that urgent a priority for any one w/out an oil spill in their backyard.
2699 2018-03-28 17:37:58 what brand of tea tree oil do u use? :) haaay pimple patches are truly god's gift to mankind
2700 2018-03-28 17:37:55 Who cares what conservatives think about climate change? Clean energy is economically competitive and can often beat oil & gas. IMO, that's a better area for collaboration. BTW, I'm going to a libertarians conference soon to try out these arguments. I'll let you know what I find!
2701 2018-03-28 17:37:42 @Oil_Guns_Merica they were sick of The Dark Lord
2702 2018-03-28 17:37:31 I could write and ode to copaiba oil right now for taking this migraine from a level 7 down to a 4.
2703 2018-03-28 17:37:19 "Bad Medicine" #Bull showed us once again perfect Team synergy, opening the subject of legalization of marijuana oil for medical purposes, a mother who will give everything for her child, tense moments on a courtroom and hospital, emotional moments...and many more!!!
2704 2018-03-28 17:36:59 I'm fucking PO'ed about oil.
2705 2018-03-28 17:36:53 Lol, i'd rather be boiled in oil
2706 2018-03-28 17:36:50 Been up for an hour. Car needs oil change so I can’t go anywhere. Nothing to read or watch. Can’t go back to sleep. IM BORED!
2707 2018-03-28 17:36:34 ALERT: The missing link in the #TrumpRussia scandal seems to be Russian born Len Blavatnik. He made his billions off Russian oil linked to the Dossier. He gave millions via his company to super PACs owned by Republicans in Congress. Everyone should take a peek at what he’s done.
2708 2018-03-28 17:36:34 Segun usted los vehiculo,aviones,barcos y demas se moveran x la conversion de jalea de aguacate como combustible. No sera mejor cultivar aguacates, papa,yuca,arroz,frutales por un lado y el petroleo por otro ? O es que ya tienen por debajo de la mesa el torcido para importar oil.
2709 2018-03-28 17:36:23 HALAL CHILI GARLIC OIL.

Wag mahihiyang magtanong!
2710 2018-03-28 17:36:15 @EPAScottPruitt Need to set rules so every regulation has to be based in real science and fact. Must have sensible rick/rewards solutions. Sweet Penn grade Oil has never harmed anything but vegetation on a short term basis and should not be forced to be hauled to a landfill
2711 2018-03-28 17:36:08 So does Oil
2712 2018-03-28 17:36:05 Maybe? We’re going to Madison over the weekend and I have been eating whole food, plant based, no oil for a few months now. I haven’t mastered eating away from home yet.
2713 2018-03-28 17:35:53 Coffee tastes like motor oil but I’ve chugged an entire pot of it. It’s fine everything’s fine
2714 2018-03-28 17:35:50 Literally had three men come at me all at once trying to get me to add so much shit when all I want is an oil change
2715 2018-03-28 17:35:22 Hi lady
When was Oil started to buy from KRG by #Turkey?

@TankerTrackers
2716 2018-03-28 17:35:21 I need the government to provide free beard oil and balm. Razors, trimmers and shave cream. Aftershave.
2717 2018-03-28 17:35:09 Smoke oil
2718 2018-03-28 17:35:08 Oil changes and high speed internet
2719 2018-03-28 17:34:55 When you just ask for an oil change but the mechanic suggests to do some extra work that clearly is not needed.
2720 2018-03-28 17:34:52 Surely dirty Russian oil money is preferable to Dirty Ken Bates?
2721 2018-03-28 17:34:27 Just take some cannabis oil and be done with it bfr they kill you..
2722 2018-03-28 17:34:25 Castor oil is life

2724 2018-03-28 17:34:06 Fuuuuuuuck!! Put too much lavender oil on my pillow and now my room honks and it’s giving me a sare heed 
2725 2018-03-28 17:34:04 But now we’re owned by dirty Russian oil money.
2726 2018-03-28 17:33:46 @Bob_Stauffer-Happy birthday old fella. I hope to hear your voice & opinions in #Oil country for a long long time. Good luck, good health & God bless. Enjoy the spring/summer break.
2727 2018-03-28 17:33:45 peppermint oil and lavender oil on the temples are usually my go to for headaches. If it's really bad, I put a wet washcloth over my head as well. The oil right on my tooth and on the gums worked like a charm
2728 2018-03-28 17:33:36 Snake oil salesman
2729 2018-03-28 17:33:36 when i started breaking out really bad months ago i tried a lot of products that sucked but the body shop tea tree face wash, toner and oil from ulta has helped SO much!
2730 2018-03-28 17:33:29 Sure sweetie, sure.

You know the government doesn’t import oil, right? You understand that? Private companies import oil and they do it because it makes competitive sense.  AB oil not competitive despite millions of dollars in production subsidies.

Are you for real??
2731 2018-03-28 17:33:09 I open twitter and see ''oil cum'' and ''mecha nekomaru's blue cum''
we don't talk about this in my house goodb   ye
2732 2018-03-28 17:33:00 You won't do it
2733 2018-03-28 17:32:50 Stretching and I ensure I take fish oil and get plenty of protein intake
2734 2018-03-28 17:32:45 not sure if my face is breaking out from using jamaican castor oil or dealing with this boy again

2736 2018-03-28 17:32:42 want to try acrylic and oil painting in my illustrationsssss ahhhhhh
2737 2018-03-28 17:32:32 “You know this isn’t the cheap oil?” The guy at 5 minute oil says while I hand him my credit card and silently cry.
2738 2018-03-28 17:32:18 They are going to expose him eventually. Putin has been stockpiling gold to buy crude oil from China and is ready to stick it to America. That is why he should never have Congratulated Putin on his so called presidential victory.
2739 2018-03-28 17:31:47 Oh look, more baseless nonsense. USA has it's own oil, and it's much cheaper then dealing with Arab dictators. And Imperialism? are you serious? that was a failed project on every aspect, and it fell apart a long time ago, what are you going to bring up next? the crusades?
2740 2018-03-28 17:31:47 My mom would like me to try CBD oil to help manage my chronic illness. I know this bc a bottle of CBD showed up on my doorstep this week. So I mean. I'm taking it. It's not like it can hurt.

Truthfully speaking, I don't think I feel much of a change yet. Tastes like pine sap.
2741 2018-03-28 17:31:42 oil cum
2742 2018-03-28 17:31:40 Y’all are the ones who HAVE to stop and comment, the difference between us and y’all is when We see a canola oil post We scroll past it cause Were not obsessed  5H queens of making y’all PRESSED
2743 2018-03-28 17:31:33 Sitting at the dealership getting my oil changed smelling like a vat of pasta sauce because I just worked the lunch shift

2747 2018-03-28 17:31:06 Cities of Salt by Abdelrahman Munif that deals with the discovery of oil in the desert countries. So unique that I can't stop recommending it.

2752 2018-03-28 17:30:41 Estimado @halconada a tu art de Oil agrégale la plata q se nos quedó a los operadores, que pagamos el combustible y nunca fue entregado. Son millones!
2753 2018-03-28 17:30:34 Thanks, great list.  Any suggestions to understand the current plumbing of the global economy that ties together China, oil, gold, Eurodollar markets, currency markets, etc?
2754 2018-03-28 17:30:22 So I can stay hold my oil short 
2755 2018-03-28 17:30:08 It's all knockdown time because now there's no viability in a pre crisis model, and no axoimatic rates of return of 7.1% ! 
with a new volatile 4th generation post oil economy emerging there must be disruption at all costs

2757 2018-03-28 17:29:47 Mimi, I just put some jade bloom lavender essential oil on a cotton ball and I sniffed it. Thank you. I had a lavender scented thing for my eyes, for headaches but gave it to my friend.

2764 2018-03-28 17:28:33 If you can talk yourself into a clarasonic or similar brush they make a world of difference. A toner and serum or oil is also a great addition!
2765 2018-03-28 17:28:26 more fresh oil and growth
2766 2018-03-28 17:28:16 @Oil_Guns_Merica @Toni_Airaksinen @campusreform Thank you!
2767 2018-03-28 17:28:08 Pour yeast mixture over other ingredients (except olive oil) in a mixing bowl.  If you do not have an automatic mixer and you make this often you will have arms like Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Add olive oil then mix again.  Then cover with cloth to let rise (25-30 minutes).  2 of 3
2768 2018-03-28 17:27:46 I know how to change a tire and put oil in the car and that’s about it, so I think I’m pretty good husband material haha

"We are working to shift from a year-to-year agreement to a 10-20 year agreement…We have an agreement on the big picture but not yet on the details”, said Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
2776 2018-03-28 17:26:59 Has #bulletproofcoffee given anyone else headaches the first week? Had one every other day... Maybe it’s the brain octane oil. Started with a table spoon. Then a teaspoon. Now I’m down to half a teaspoon. Probably started to high...   
2777 2018-03-28 17:26:59 HAHAHAHA fuck youuu it’s not the oil
2778 2018-03-28 17:26:27 Coconut oil is not something to underestimate.
2779 2018-03-28 17:26:16 I use unscented antibacterial soap twice then a little coconut oil depending on drying/area
2780 2018-03-28 17:26:04 Only until someone decides you can get oil out of them...
2781 2018-03-28 17:25:58 but we don t buy anything. Fuel oil 1.5 usd.
2782 2018-03-28 17:25:45 Hopefully these new wagons won’t drop oil everywhere they go.
2783 2018-03-28 17:25:35 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
2784 2018-03-28 17:25:31 You have GORGEOUS hair. My hair doesn’t grow for shit & trust meeeeee I babt the fuck out of it. I only wash it once a week, mask with coconut oil constantly, use less heat, only salon grade sulfate & paraben free products. It’s wild haha
2785 2018-03-28 17:25:29 @Menards $3.29 4 a quart of oil? I can remember when I paid $.89¢ 4 a quart. Man talk about inflation!
2786 2018-03-28 17:25:05 Ohmygosh! For 50 years I hated beets, wouldn't even dye wool with beet juice because of the smell! Last year my taste buds changed and now I love them all ways! My favorite is sliced and roasted with minced garlic and sea salt.. olive oil or sesame oil, whatever I have on hand.
2787 2018-03-28 17:25:03 Let me start..  Ori, coconut oil and cocoa butter
2788 2018-03-28 17:24:59 Remind her of jesus who was crucified and 11 of the apostles who died miserable deaths( beheaded, crucified upside down, boiled in oil, thrown of a cliff etc)
2789 2018-03-28 17:24:56 They removed dustbin because airport ferry crews throw oil cans and oil wast into the bins. But there should be some other ways to control that instead of removing the bins
2790 2018-03-28 17:24:49 Not putting oil in the engine of a knowledge based economy prevents going forward but reflection of state dependency on natural resources and more about power than evidence informed decision making.
2791 2018-03-28 17:24:41 おらすげぇ興奮すっぞ
2792 2018-03-28 17:24:37 Yes it is all about oil. They want to trade in gold/yuan instead of USD. Israel/US/Saudi Arabia are trying to keep the petrodollar standard in existence. Syria is just trying to make the most economically sensible decision.

It is about Greed, and I would say US is most at fault.
2793 2018-03-28 17:23:47 Any sweet potato lovers got any good ideas for how to eat them? I’ve always hated them. I like savory stuff so maybe pan fried in cubes in grapeseed oil? With ketchup and hot sauce? Lol
2794 2018-03-28 17:23:44 Also if you have anxiety, lavender is AMAZING at relieving symptoms. I used to put it on my wrists and smell it throughout the day to stop panic attacks. I use peppermint oil on my temples for headaches and tummy for cramps too.
2795 2018-03-28 17:23:40 Rub it with olive oil, salt, & pepper. Leave out to come to room temperature (about 30 mins). Heat pan with a small amount of olive oil. Grill or pan sear over low-medium heat until internal temp of 140, or until it feels like pad of your thumb when you pinch your middle finger
2796 2018-03-28 17:23:39 Put teaspoon oil in the pan and fry them a bit then add some butter and garlic lemon juice and fresh parsley and cook for 3 min or so...season with salt and pepper...garlic butter recipe...you can do that with shrimp or any meats or veggies its delish...instead of sprouts
2797 2018-03-28 17:23:38 I love a good dose of motor oil
2798 2018-03-28 17:23:30 Trump calling someone else a criminal is like the pot calling the kettle black, like vegetable oil calling motor oil grease. like urine telling feces you stank. a herion addict calling a crackhead junkie.
2799 2018-03-28 17:23:29 Thoughts and prayers. You lead tainted snake oil salesman and performance artist.
2800 2018-03-28 17:23:28 .Threw that oil on my daughter forehead this morning before I sent her to school. 
2801 2018-03-28 17:23:27 oregano oil !!!!!
2802 2018-03-28 17:23:21 I’m still trying to figure out why the little pub inside the rink in Clairmont was packed last night during the Oil game when on one rink there was a Atom practice and the other a beer league game 
2803 2018-03-28 17:23:20 People keep calling data the new oil but use the term mining  suggesting data is in fact more like coal ... dirty and polluting
2804 2018-03-28 17:23:18 Settle the debate: check oil while warm or cold? #inquiringmindswanttoknow
2805 2018-03-28 17:23:12 But any form 2 science student would tell u kuti diesel, paraffin, petrol, kerosene are all obtained from fractional distillation of crude oil. And a whole cabinet dropped into such a show of desperation! I pray everyday facing the compass direction to my country, like Daniel!
2806 2018-03-28 17:23:08 The same way nobody thought an oil well named “Macondo” wouldn’t be blown away by catastrophe at the end of the story (see: 100 Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez)
2807 2018-03-28 17:23:05 Seriously wallah I knew it's oil. Coconut ka sure nai that but oil pata thi Mujhe
2808 2018-03-28 17:23:01 Well you guys could send me a new one or if I send mine in maybe you could fix the problem it just started leaking oil for no reason! I’ve been buying your products for years my whole family uses ryobi tools!

2814 2018-03-28 17:22:20 I was deep sea fishing 5 years ago. I got bad motion sickness. Lavender oil behind the ear totally worked for me.
2815 2018-03-28 17:22:15 My favourite way to annoy Charlie is to say "You're [whatever it is she's just said]"

Me: You're gonna be so oily

2819 2018-03-28 17:22:02 Using a muscle rub or essential oil blend works for me. Plus, I keep moving even if muscles are sore the next day.

4. Need to maintain perspective: this will displace ONG (#oil, #naturalgas) burning for electricity. You prefer that?

2828 2018-03-28 17:21:16 I don't but anything should do. The one I used to get was absurdly big. In any case coconut oil is good for so many things too so it doesn't get wasted.
2829 2018-03-28 17:21:13 Because literally no one on this planet is like the rock/uses the amount of baby oil that he does
2830 2018-03-28 17:21:12 Best pizza dough EVAH.  1 cup tepid water, 1 tsp agave nectar, 1 tbsp yeast, 2 cups whole wheat flour, 1 cup oatmeal, 2 tbsp masa (corn flour), 2 tbsp flax seed, 1 tbsp olive oil.  Pour yeast onto water & let sit covered until bubbling starts (20 min. approx.)  1 of 3

I know you must refrain from too many bad comments towards CHINA & you know it's their intention to take over world SUPER POWER! You must GETITRIGHT!
2833 2018-03-28 17:20:41 As in brand or scent? Just avoid ordering oils online unless they’re 100% reputable. If you get oil for cheap it’s probably mixed with harmful chemicals— no good, pure oil is cheap. I like Lavender the most, then peppermint. I get mine locally. Look for holistic health shops! 
2834 2018-03-28 17:20:40 U.S. exports of LNG reached 1.94 Bcfd in 2017, up from 0.5 Bcfd in 2016. More than half (53%) of U.S. LNG exports in 2017 were shipped to 3 countries: Mexico, South Korea, & China #Oil #USA #LNG #Mexico #SouthKorea #China
2835 2018-03-28 17:20:16 I doubt if oil companies report the actual revenue.

Our Edge control & Our Oil mist.
2837 2018-03-28 17:19:55 Maybe, but I think it was mostly because the oil deal between Exxon-Mobil and Rosneft was cancelled and he was no longer relevant. I think that's the only reason he was there in the first place.
2838 2018-03-28 17:19:52 Name 5 sounds or smells that make you smile. Tagged by @WritingRon

5. Sweet almond oil
2839 2018-03-28 17:19:41 "Graphics" don't matter to me, at least with things like Skyrim in 4K with max settings and oil painting shaders. That's a fast way to kill a graphics card.

Nintendo is more concerned with colorful and stylish games on limited hardware. I think their library ages better for it.
2840 2018-03-28 17:19:39 Ordered some oil from piston ring this morning at 8 am had it dropped off at my work by 9 & there power was out all morning ! You the real mvps

2849 2018-03-28 17:17:59 I was in university when they attacked palm/coconut oil & popcorn. Back then, I was naive and believed the media reports. It wasn't until last year when I listened to "The Big Fat Surprise" that I got the backstory on #CSPI, their flip flopping stances and conflicts of interests

2851 2018-03-28 17:17:29 Self-Care Idea: 

Lather your skin in a high quality cold pressed oil when you are fresh out of the shower and your pores are open. As you rub the oil in, speak kindly to your body. Make it personal to what your body needs do hear from you. Connect with your vessel. Love it.

2869 2018-03-28 17:15:02 @rosie once called @realDonaldTrump a "snake oil salesman," which is similar to @marcorubio's observation that Trump would be "selling watches in Manhattan" if he was not running for office. What happened to that Rubio? #ThoughtsWhileScrollingTwitter
2870 2018-03-28 17:15:00 Canada is not really a country. Alberta oil is land locked by communist politicians in BC and Ottawa. Yet oil is imported from countries without any human rights. Time to separate Alberta.

2957 2018-03-28 17:05:48 Thank you! It's been a rough one today, but I am gradually feeling better so far. I also realize that I somehow got peppermint essential oil on to my earbuds, hence that extra 'tingly' feeling. 
2958 2018-03-28 17:05:44 The effects would be limited given that much of the oil will still move by rail, and would come at the heavy cost in terms of AB politics and more general possible national cooperation on the issue.

2964 2018-03-28 17:04:28 True, I receive $8.00 on my paycheck...... this is why the government is in a 20 Trillion Debt hole, due to low taxes on the 1% that are already well off, Wars-Regime Change proxy wars, low taxes for Oil industry like @ExxonMobil_EU 17.2% tax rate 0 federal Taxes, list goes on!

2972 2018-03-28 17:02:53 Export of crude oil will help our balance of payments - but it is an understood economic fact - exporting FINISHED PRODUCTS gives much higher profits - we must move to increase refining capacity and manufacturing of petrochemicals - and export these to worldwide customers

2988 2018-03-28 17:00:45 I mean if you plan on actually doing anything with a 370 why would you keep the oil system stock?

2995 2018-03-28 17:00:15 WHY did Chavez never use any of that oil money to fund tuition free college and create small business loans at low interest to create a real safety net.  I mean I was taught in school a one resource economy was very tenuous in terms of stability.
2996 2018-03-28 17:00:10 It's a reasonable bill too. Only applies to oil painting portraits. There really is no reason for gvt to spend $ on oil paintings of gvt officials. We have these things called cameras now and they even take digital photos.
2997 2018-03-28 17:00:09 I disagree. There is no fact of a checks and balance system in the link you provided.

3021 2018-03-28 16:58:33 How Often Should I change my car Oil?
Most cars can go at least 5,000 miles before an oil change. “Change your car's engine oil every three months, or 3,000 miles.” At one time, that was standard auto advice.

3035 2018-03-28 16:57:36 At the same time the Oil did just what we fans did.  Saw McD rack up three points and then kicked back to watch the rest of the McD score at will blow out.  At the same time they mentally down shifted, Columbus stepped on gas.

3047 2018-03-28 16:56:34 It’s not tar sands, you can see oil run into the Athabasca river. Not even near where they mine for it, comes out of the banks miles up stream. You want tar go to southern Cal. tar pits.

3049 2018-03-28 16:56:17 Is the problem of producing oil solved?
3050 2018-03-28 16:56:11 We had oil but no education.  This never would've happened if we had invested oil money in educating the poor. Hope we learn the lesson!!
3051 2018-03-28 16:55:44 a) We seriously need to do something about the abysmal state of rail in this country
b) forget tilting at windmills to get the oil tanker ban reversed and build a refinery. Good jobs, necessary product, (not dependent on world markets,) potential for further development

3057 2018-03-28 16:54:31 I run a business in Alberta. Liberal have done nothing to help me out. In fact they have taxed every dollar I make to death. Demonizing oil and gas was also a hit against women in Alberta.

3062 2018-03-28 16:53:10 Things in Fort Mac are even worse. The big oil companies were crying for tradesmen during the boom. We answered, moved our families here, paid big money for housing and now the companies are trying to kill our jobs and the threat of lockouts loom.

3066 2018-03-28 16:52:15 The same thing happened in the 1980s when I was at LSU. They were losing all their economic professors. The oil bust happened and the state reacted by cutting higher ed. Our professors let us know they had received better offers elsewhere and were leaving.
3067 2018-03-28 16:51:53 Sis if you look like the government is about to install an oil rig on top of your your head, PUT YOUR HAIR UP!!!
3068 2018-03-28 16:51:48 Oil changes used to be expensive at $25. Now it's roughly 100+ no wonder so many people are changing their own oil.
3069 2018-03-28 16:51:44 Not sure where you are located but if possible look into fully extracted cannabis oil. Stay away from sugar. Only eat organic, no preservatives, & no GMO. My husband is a naturopathic physician and has helped many people. Different strains will help both of your issues no pharma
3070 2018-03-28 16:51:41 "'Now when anyone presents a grain offering as an offering to the LORD, his offering shall be of fine flour, and he shall pour oil on it and put frankincense on it."  Lev 2:1
3071 2018-03-28 16:51:21 I feel like I have my life together because so far today I’ve : went to class, got my oil changed and car maintenanced, picked up a prescription, and  just got a healthy lunch all before noon 
3072 2018-03-28 16:51:07 I came in for an oil change and now I need 2 back tires. 
3073 2018-03-28 16:51:04 @HomefuelsDirect we’re still awaiting heating oil? When will it be delivered between 11-3? It’s now 17:50... Nr256qr
3074 2018-03-28 16:51:01 So that’s Ilham Bridge completed, photographed and posted on here, on FB and on the web site. I’ve already prepped the oil of Jarrold’s Corner in Norwich, and am ready to make a start on that. I might take a short break, or I might just get stuck in.
3075 2018-03-28 16:50:59 Everything smells like baby oil and im happy.
3076 2018-03-28 16:50:48 Jojoba oil works wonders, I use to sleep.
3077 2018-03-28 16:50:36 السعادة لقلبك 
3078 2018-03-28 16:50:25 oil claims to bring in money, but what happens when the oil spills...oh yeah we have to pay for the cleanup!
3079 2018-03-28 16:50:19 So deep i found oil.
3080 2018-03-28 16:50:18 I love shampoo that has peppermint oil in it. Every morning is like an early 2000s Herbal Essences commercial
3081 2018-03-28 16:50:15 Love seeing an 80+ great grandma ditch her fentanyl patches for some CBD oil.

3083 2018-03-28 16:49:59 No matter how many times I get an oil change I always feel like my car is going to fall through the huge hole in the floor when they are directing me to pull forward
3084 2018-03-28 16:49:53 Thank you Michelle. I'm looking forward to learning oil painting. 
3085 2018-03-28 16:49:48 Kai, Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly Oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off Buildings. Pls tell @vancouverpride how u rationalize obstructing  Gay friendly Oil while enriching Gay killing oil @VictoriaPride
3086 2018-03-28 16:49:46 @LeeStrobel also diet is hard but worth it,  can heal from it!!!!
No gluten, no eggs ( virus love to feed on eggs) canola oil, dairy, metal or any type of chemical fumes, corn or actually corn byproducts like corn syrup, cornstarch) pork while the liver heals and detoxes
3087 2018-03-28 16:49:43 Im sitting and waiting for an oil change and decide to look through old pictures on my phone. I miss how tan I was and I miss all the people on my pictures that I don’t talk to anymore.  Taught me to never take anyone for granted

3089 2018-03-28 16:49:40 Yeah not trigger. Had a cordial conversation with you, and let you prove in your tweets that you are fake. I knew the entire time, but I entertained it. Keep trying to sell your snake oil. Hope you start sleeping better.  I know it’s been a rough time the past year.
3090 2018-03-28 16:49:29 I gotta learn how to change the oil in the whip on my own oil
3091 2018-03-28 16:49:27 Well, when I search it shows "Alberta oil sands before and after", but it looks like there are different locations, and/or scale in those images.  I wanted to fly over with GoogleEarth and see for myself, as I suspect the image is fake.
3092 2018-03-28 16:49:24 I love cooking my own jollof rice with palm oil.. Sweet something

3096 2018-03-28 16:48:52 Question for any oil painters if any see this; looking into some mediums for the paints but I don't trust my research and instincts enough. Which medium is best to get for a relative beginner to oils? #art

3170 2018-03-28 16:41:32 It's not just a cheap energy source.  It's the foundation of our entire industrialized economy.  Until that foundation changes, attempts to keep Alberta oil 'in the ground' are counter-productive.  Sorry but, jobs take priority.
3171 2018-03-28 16:41:27 Got to love this.  Democrats have been allowing illegals to vote for years.  They move them inot states they want to take over and crowd out the legals at the polls.  Oil Cos did this in Alaska in the oil boom.  Unfair to citizens and should be illegal.

3191 2018-03-28 16:39:44 Getting oil in my eye wasn't on my agenda today. It burns 
3192 2018-03-28 16:39:31 Rolling or scrunching up. It’s a strong adhesive so after I take it off, I just use a little bit of cornstarch and coconut oil to take care of the residue.
3193 2018-03-28 16:39:21 The world needs to phase out oil and the oil barons. Their business practices are a danger to humans and the environment.
3194 2018-03-28 16:39:19 You oil and moisturize it every other day? Drinking water?
3195 2018-03-28 16:39:14 I saw those girls with pretty dress I’m sure I once wore (a real soccer girl)

3202 2018-03-28 16:38:23 By the time the pharmaceutical companies do their thing with it to be oil why not just take medicine? I’ve smoked it didn’t help my pain, but a lot of people swear to it, I did sleep for 16 hrsI think just legalize the plant for any over 18/21.
3203 2018-03-28 16:38:08 I'd use that oil for sure, if it improves my health and is legalized.

3210 2018-03-28 16:37:27 Agreed on McKinnon. But to your 2nd point, why? The body of McDavid's work shouldn't be overlooked because of his GMs inability to ice a competitive roster. Whether the Oil are in a playoff spot or not McDavid is always going to have that level of prominence on our roster.
3211 2018-03-28 16:37:16 Well no, that's what happens when you put corn syrup and sugar in everything and create a culture where getting fast food at the end of a long day of working, commuting, dealing with the kids, and other stressors is more appealing than making healthy food at home.

3213 2018-03-28 16:37:14 That’s a tough one. I wouldn’t do one of the three centres. I think Klef or Larsson would be a sideways move. Nurse would be the only guy left that Minny might say yes to and I don’t think Oil fans would be happy with that
3214 2018-03-28 16:37:09 Stop condemning the oil+gas industry, or any industry as a matter of fact. What we benefit from right now, is a result of industries. The more we condemn them, the more they affect us and our planet. Instead, genuinely bless them and visualise their ‘poisons’ turn to gold 
3215 2018-03-28 16:37:07 @SearsAuto so I scheduled an oil change online made a 12:00 appointment got there early it’s now 12:34 my car hasn’t been moved from I pulled in. When I asked how long it would take I was told an hour?!? Really an hour for what should be a 15-20 minute job anywhere else!
3216 2018-03-28 16:36:52 Those things aren’t mutually exclusive. He’s very likely both.
3217 2018-03-28 16:36:48 Nope not with economists that only support dirty jobs and spin stories about what good shape were in. Hate to see an oil spin happen under Trump. He'd likely cover it up.

3221 2018-03-28 16:36:18 I’m tired of being asked if @Seahawks are rebuilding. Changes to an NFL roster is like giving your car a tune up!  You will need oil changes, new plugs, wipers, brakes and tires then your ready to roll.  What I do say is they must replace with high quality parts!  #NFLDraftNews

3223 2018-03-28 16:36:05 Ogoni Clean-up Launch: On June 2, President Buhari flagged off the clean-up of the oil-devastated region of Ogoni in Rivers State. The clean up signals the president’s commitment to the oil region despite continuing flashes of violence by militants opposed to his policies.

3235 2018-03-28 16:34:41 It sounds weird but use coconut oil and blend it into your coffee to make a dope lattée. I'd say about a tablespoon should work, but you have to blend it or it won't emulsify.
3236 2018-03-28 16:34:37 Try tea tree oil!

3356 2018-03-28 16:20:27 A doctor's apathy
"People eat samosas made of recycled oil"
"they eat panipuri filled with contaminated water"
"they drink poison in the name of coke &Pepsi"
"they smoke and drink"
When i write prescription they ask 
"Doctor is there any side effect?"

Silly

3357 2018-03-28 16:20:11 I wouldn't expect his phobia to be rational & I don't believe he sees it as shielding them from war but rather shielding others who may have similar phobias from them, most conservatives are all gung ho about dying in pointless wars for oil so they need no more persuasion.

3376 2018-03-28 16:18:10 I thought "tar sands" WAS the proper name, since that's what is has been  called since the 1930s? "Oil sands" was introduced in the 1990s as a PR exercise.

3384 2018-03-28 16:17:06 PADD3 inventory is falling hard the last 2 weeks (8.8 MBLS) consistent with pick up in refinery run rate. Looks to me that light oil production increase has been absorbed by refineries.
3385 2018-03-28 16:16:54 Does he believe we'd be pumping our cars full of whale oil if not for the tar sands?
3386 2018-03-28 16:16:52 finally saw Nat Bates for Mayor last night - such a brilliant takedown of oil refinery politics....best shot: pan down line of Indian religious leaders in turbans and there’s Nat, the 83-yr-old Chevron stooge, grinning in his makeshift turban, making the rounds on a Sunday...
3387 2018-03-28 16:16:48 Shoot, was in a meeting without access! Did we get white down? Appears somsince oil has dropped! 
3388 2018-03-28 16:16:45 My D is chronically low due to gastric bypass but I keep forgetting to take it! Really need to pay better attention.  Same with B12 but I get shots 2x a month, which still doesn’t bring me up to optimal level.  Just started the magnesium, and have ordered cbd oil for anxiety.
3389 2018-03-28 16:16:41 The half-life of plastic, and its permutations, its plasticity--if you will--or even if you won't!--is a fascinating study. And then there's that twice-Texas sized island, to which your hat owes its last allegiance. Worthy of an oil painting.

I mean seriously. I don't really care about humans too much either. I'm not joking. Humans are bullshit.
3402 2018-03-28 16:14:58 I did something dizzy the other day. I was making eggs but as the oil was heating up I noticed it was too much for my eggs. Guess what I did? 

Yep I attempted to pour the oil back into the plastic bottle. It shrunk

3482 2018-03-28 16:05:48 Ps 133:2: It is like precious oil poured on the head, running down on the beard, running down on Aaron’s beard, down upon the collar of his robes.
3483 2018-03-28 16:05:42 these millennial vaping hipsters get their hands on an STI, load it up with diesel oil, shit gas and ebay parts and decide no tune is best tune and launch it every red light and then wonder why nobody likes them and they're gonna die alone
3484 2018-03-28 16:05:41 Oil sector PSU's have set an example by working efficiently in very challenging conditions. The recent helicopter crash & the loss of lives of our heroes in the line of duty is a testimony of their commitment towards their work even in some of the most difficult conditions.
3485 2018-03-28 16:05:31 I just spent $50 on beard oil 
3486 2018-03-28 16:05:31 Pues yo respetaría a los militares si de verdad estuvieran luchando por causas justas, pero no es el caso. It’s all about the oil.
3487 2018-03-28 16:05:21 Seems like it’s always the worst timing whenever my car needs an oil change

3490 2018-03-28 16:05:07 That’s cool as gibb in this shit is tight i love when oil companies pay me millions of dollars in medical bills for his physical and she said “that stup….
3491 2018-03-28 16:05:05 I prefer herbal syrups...and home remedies like  applying warm mustard oil (heated with fenugreek seeds or ajjwain) on my child's chest and back. Always works!
3492 2018-03-28 16:04:57 it is quite easy when all r tuned with corrupt practices helping them earn their 10-20% tips.. when corruption is the oil for corrupt machinery then taking that oil away will create lot of friction.. at all levels.. who is surprised here??
3493 2018-03-28 16:04:51 Trade - exchange (something) for something else, typically as a commercial transaction.

3495 2018-03-28 16:04:38 Is significant portion arising out of Oil and Gas consolidation ?
3496 2018-03-28 16:04:36 We have plenty of our own oil, thank you. US is now a net exporter of energy,  mate.

3498 2018-03-28 16:04:27 Not sure what you’d be looking to it for, but cbd oil/tinctures don’t have that delicious musk
3499 2018-03-28 16:04:11 It's a Miracle Oil! I don't hurt near as much since I started using it.
3500 2018-03-28 16:04:10 Yes but our suppliers are members of the Roundtable of Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). The main goal of the organization is ethical & sustainable practices in the production of palm oil. RSPO commit to conserve resources, preserve bio-diversity & practice sustainable agriculture.
3501 2018-03-28 16:03:56 There's a bigger thesis. Todd (& Oil braintrust) believing top lines needed to be constructed with a battle cruiser on one wing.  A reasonable past premise that should have been discarded earlier in the year.
3502 2018-03-28 16:03:55 Nothing worse than going to get an oil change.

You just know they bouta come back saying some bullshit..

3505 2018-03-28 16:03:27 Hank mulls over Ellis Wyatt's burning oil fields, credits Wyatt with setting the fire, thinks the whole thing is a very good joke, experiences "a spurting, living exultation" which I invite you to interpret as you will.

3508 2018-03-28 16:02:52 The thing is, in order for Vietnam to resist China and not back down, it needs to have some minimum level of international support, otherwise its not worth it. In the 2014 oil rig incident that support was present & allowed VN to keep fighting & ultimately pushed CN to concede.
3509 2018-03-28 16:02:44 I will also remember Buhari as a President with high external reserve with low oil price. That blocks linkages in our oil revenue. That made looters feared. That also made local rice production increase. Farmers are sending their children to go school, even in Kebbi too

3511 2018-03-28 16:02:24 Iirc, my wife uses lavender oil. Just a few drops in the water, no more. 

Any other use, forget it. Ingesting oils is harmful, they’re too strong to apply as a topical and will cause rash, so only real use for them is aromatherapy

3524 2018-03-28 16:01:09 Thank you Honda of Hollywood for taking an hour and 45 minutes for an oil change this morning. 1 hour for the change, 30 minutes for paperwork and 15 MINUTES TO BRING ME MY CAR. By my 7a appt you can see how I wanted to be an hour late to work. #sarcastic #hondaofhollywood @Honda – bij Honda of Hollywood
3525 2018-03-28 16:01:02 and many other car related things. My brother & dad taught me when I was a teenager & good thing because my first car was a POS & leaked oil like it was it's damn job
3526 2018-03-28 16:01:02 local @Sephora store don't stock @sundayriley  Good Gene,  U.F.O face oil, or Luna sleeping oil. Where can I get a sample?

3529 2018-03-28 16:00:54 Well, sport, if you're stuck in the 40's don't blame me.  The fact is the U.S. is as dependent of middle eastern oil as we were in the 90's or before.  If you really think everything we do is focused around oil, then enjoy your tinfoil hat wearing.

3531 2018-03-28 16:00:53 Remember if you're changing your own headlights, don't touch the glass. Oil from your fingers can cause cracks sooner.
3532 2018-03-28 16:00:52 English media have told them for decades that they subsidise scots,,even though scots have the oil and gas,,English people would kick scots out in a heartbeat,their politicians though, they know how westminster needs scotland`s resources
3533 2018-03-28 16:00:43 Some paper cuts are okay to catch the larger move. I secured my profits. Oil to 100 isn’t happening anytime soon. Maybe in time for Zec to Btc parity.
3534 2018-03-28 16:00:37 With China's creation of an international oil market governed in CNY, aggressive US trade policy directed in China's direction, and Russia meddling in all types of international affairs, the case for #Bitcoin adoption as a middle ground grows by the day.

3543 2018-03-28 15:59:56 lol missing the point. What Sam is saying is that don't you guys use oil coming from those pipelines?
3544 2018-03-28 15:59:42 Better to drain there reserves, making our oil more valuable. That's business. Your reasoning is anti American and pro Putin.
3545 2018-03-28 15:59:41 I take 3-4 stalks of fresh asparagus, put them in a bowl with a dash of lemon juice, olive oil, garlic and red pepper flakes,  wrap with a piece of thick cut bacon and bake 425 for about 15-20 min until bacon is cooked. (may need to flip em if bacon is real thick)
3546 2018-03-28 15:59:25 Now we wait and see how it plays out. Short oil or oil $100 gfy
3547 2018-03-28 15:59:24 i need that shirt that says “the heaviest weight you’ll ever lift is your ass off the couch”
3548 2018-03-28 15:59:15 LOL,,,we will go and take the 92% of oil revenue that westminster has taken for 40 years,,,Scotland will fare well,England will lose 92% of oil and gas revenues,,so good luck with that,,you should`nt believe your media Liam
3549 2018-03-28 15:59:06 That's why I bought 10 barrels of Oil #oil=lambo
3550 2018-03-28 15:59:02 As usual, the Incoherence Institute is forgetting the massive federal subsidies used to build out infrastructure for gasoline stations in the form of paved roads. Now Oil and Gas toadies want to have their cake and keep you from having yours too. #copolitics #coleg

3560 2018-03-28 15:58:11 Este caso puntual no sirve. No hay generación de riqueza sin tributar, hay estafa al quedarse con fondos estatales.
Si hacía ese conglomerado descontando impuestos al consumidor de OIL el ejemplo sería válido.
3561 2018-03-28 15:58:09 A pipeline from the west feeding our eastern refineries would eliminate Saudi oil.Decreasewater traffic on our sea ways that would give these whales a bit more space.We know how safe it is to fly as to driving but never how much safer pipelines are to train,oil tankers,& trucking

3577 2018-03-28 15:56:32 The sexism was a problem for sure.  I think this "life education" class should be things like:

- Replacing an outlet
- Rewiring a lamp
- Changing the oil / tires on your care
- Fixing a leaky faucet

etc.

Any of these would've been more useful to me than dissecting a frog

3591 2018-03-28 15:55:28 A 1.6% drop from European banks is still pathetic two years after Paris agreement (and the report does not even cover conventional oil&gas), but encouraging to see @bbva's recent policy moves on fossil fuels

3596 2018-03-28 15:54:45 There's a delicate balance between dressing and greens in a salad.  Too much salad dressing and you may as well just do a shot of olive oil.  Too little and it's like eating yard clippings.

3601 2018-03-28 15:54:08 I hear yah. Trust me, we'd prefer to have McDavid at 90 points and the Oilers be at 100. That's a fail on the GM. It's been a tough 10-11 yrs. We celebrate McDavid because he's the best thing going on right now. Oh, and 80% of us didn't put the Oil as #1 Cup favorites.

3619 2018-03-28 15:52:03 Well, that was Friday's "Hello Bolton, goodbye McMaster" end of the world rally in #crude.  Pfft.  Gone.  How fickle oil traders are.  #OOTT
3620 2018-03-28 15:52:03 I think it's a HUGE crap shoot. Example: One scenario is Permian "plays out" just as Venz comes back to full prod and saves the day. = sustained low prices. Another is Permian plays out just as Venz gets worse = $200 oil. Impossible to know the relative timing of events.

3623 2018-03-28 15:51:46 The pupils were eager 2 learn about the career opportunities in each stage of the value chain and the importance of an oil and gas barge, opportunities for internships, workbased learning & apprenticeship. They asked a lot of questions on the impact of humans on our environment
3624 2018-03-28 15:51:36 Please stop fracking. Support renewables. Plastic is a byproduct of OIL N GAS industry. Democracy demands divesting. Water IS life. Clean air helps too. The people are NOT stupid

3626 2018-03-28 15:51:29 I think I need a new oil diffuser??
3627 2018-03-28 15:51:18 Nathan, Dems who take money from big oil and Wall St are never going to save you from big oil and Wall St. It is time for a change. "Dem is the only way" is what the Dems want you think. They want you to dream it and breathe it and bully others over it.
3628 2018-03-28 15:51:12 I greenhouse it like once a week with olive oil. Use coconut oil every other day or two days. Cowash it once a week then the following day put grape linseed oil on it

3640 2018-03-28 15:50:06 Yes, with crude oil at $50 the North Sea is barely profitable. 
This isn't news, it's been like this for a couple of years at least. Has your favourite source of news not covered this?

3642 2018-03-28 15:50:04 in defence of the oil in our cars, the animals were dead before they sank into the bottom of the ocean. We are running our cars with the anoxicly decomposed corpses of ancient plankton.

3677 2018-03-28 15:45:20 Fed gov't has put themselves in a precarious position. On the one hand they want to "fight" climate change. On the other hand they realize they need Alberta's oil/pipelines to bring income into Canada and help with employment. A decision either way, they piss off voters.

3681 2018-03-28 15:44:59 Not long ago "Peak Oil" meant we were running out of supply. When that narrative collapsed a new one needs to be created. Hence "Peak Oil Demand".
3682 2018-03-28 15:44:58 I’m surprised he would sign this, because it means no oil painting of him to eventually display at the WH and Fed buildings. Maybe they put a provision in for him to be the last??? Wouldn’t surprise me.

3687 2018-03-28 15:44:29 "you've been cooking this thing all wrong!! Use coconut oil/milk/etc instead and it will be so much better!"

Yeah and it will taste like coconut, which tastes bad
3688 2018-03-28 15:44:26 You go get a oil change and they recommend 9 things you need now
3689 2018-03-28 15:44:26 Yo don't need conserve. Just grate the tomato and add some salt and pepper (and garlic if you like it). Then the olive oil on the toast and after that the tomato. That's the way we do it in our homes.

3742 2018-03-28 15:39:34 Of course they aren't. They've gotten drilling rights that previously protected our reserves. Drain our reserves and expose our country to control by those that have oil. Russians. That's a threat to national security. You can buy guns. No gun powder, no bullets. Watch!

3891 2018-03-28 15:26:57 It's complicated, but basically - it fails because it fails to give Clark a proper character arc.

3898 2018-03-28 15:26:07 just a fun fact, if that were to ever happen again, therapeutic essential oils are hydrophobic, meaning they don’t mix with water, so water won’t wash them off. if you ever use too much, dilute with carrier oils, like coconut oil. rub that on your skin to relieve burning!

3909 2018-03-28 15:24:55 It seems difficult, but becomes commonplace easy. When he goes out and gets stuff with friends, he asks right away about the oil. Thankfully most places use soybean instead

3916 2018-03-28 15:24:12 Arab oil exporters would want physical delivery. 5400 tons new demand. Boom. No influence on price seriously? Scary scenario but wont happen. I bet petroyuans are to be recycled in $ and in China bonds and not in gold. Maybe I am wrong lets wait and see.
3917 2018-03-28 15:24:09 Coworker walked past me and asked what scent I’m wearing.

3919 2018-03-28 15:24:04 Morneau is measuring growth in fractions because that's the highlight for his plan-it's full of higher taxes, carbon taxes, disincentives for investment in general and complete contempt for the AB oil industry. That's why he's waving a white flag in surrender.
3920 2018-03-28 15:24:03 I've really been interested in trying a facial oil especially since I have dry skin. How is this product for sensitive & dry skin?
3921 2018-03-28 15:23:47 Oil Development is Different from Fracking. Sweet Jesus. Do you understand the difference in the way the two are completed? Or what they even Produce?

3923 2018-03-28 15:23:12 Normally, we see a little dip in refinery utilization at the end of March or in April before the high demand season gets here. Refinery utilization has been strong and the oil products declines have been big despite that fact.
3924 2018-03-28 15:23:12 Why does everyone think coconut oil and apple cider vinegar is the cure for everything now?? And don't even get me started in essential oils.
3925 2018-03-28 15:23:08 There is one place in all of Oklahoma City that I know of that will pump gas for you. It's a mom and pop mechanic that also will check your oil and stuff for you. A lot of elderly people like to go there just because they appreciate the service. The gas is expensive though.
3926 2018-03-28 15:22:53 i want to say that ethan seems to do pretty well but in light of the recent scare that doesnt seem appropriate. you have to check with like every restaurant that they dont fry in peanut oil and check basically every packaged thing that it wasn’t processed in a facility with nuts.
3927 2018-03-28 15:22:50 Do you think they will have enough Sunshine ,do you think Oil is running out or perhaps people will be going for electric cars  and the need for oil will diminish.
3928 2018-03-28 15:22:44 I am taking off a day of drawing today, and what do I do? I'm going to oil paint all day. There will be progress updates. Right now it's all the knuckle-dragging set-up stuff and coffee infusion.

3936 2018-03-28 15:22:12 Personal data is the new oil, says Viviane Reding, MEP, ovreseeing the EU's position in global trade and the digital economy, in her general session speech at #GPS18

3948 2018-03-28 15:20:37 Mmmm - profits are awesome. Side thought - how essential are the Gulf Coast refineries to world oil/petro use? If the world oil market calves in two, as you foresee, will MENA suppliers still need to send tankers to Louisiana to turn sludge into gasoline?

3971 2018-03-28 15:17:50 The only thing that this Permian boom will create is a big differential (negative) between heavy and light oil (light oil being discounted)! Again, export at 1.5 million shows there is a problem with external demand. Shale is likely too light and of inconsistant quality.
3972 2018-03-28 15:17:49 Yes and so is everything else going up, & not just on April 1st. Here is an example, heating oil in Crymych was 58.9p a littre. Now it is 63.9 a littre and no doubt it will again on April 1st, silly Me things like HEATING Oil don't get included in inflation.

3980 2018-03-28 15:16:34 In the last week, Turkish petrol prices have increased by over 5%.

Turkey is an energy importer. The last time lira collapsed, it was insulated by low oil prices. Now it faces a storm. Central Bank has to act - monetary policy seems the only weapon left.
3981 2018-03-28 15:16:30 No I want them deported.  This couple should be deported after someone pours hot oil all over them.  Sorry this one made me angry.

3987 2018-03-28 15:16:01 You need nonstick paper, olive oil , a dotting tool, and a spoon to smooth it out.
Put da glue on the nonstick paper then smooth it out with da spoon dipped in da oil. Wait about 30 seconds for it to cool slightly then poke it with the dotting tool (also dipped in oil) ^-^
3988 2018-03-28 15:15:54 these are new-age robber barons extracting resources (from humans this time) before a shift in consumption/society/whathaveyou.

3989 2018-03-28 15:15:52 There is a plan for you. The $250T stolen by the cabal is not going to just go to another bad guy. I think the countries they have destroyed all over the world through the oil wars should get first dibs, however.

4047 2018-03-28 15:09:57 Yes because we’d all love to see how behind your country is with women’s rights and how you slave your lower class for oil. No thanks!
4048 2018-03-28 15:09:57 Aye they’re doing us a favour, ‘granting’ us their money, knowing what’s best for us, relieving us of our volatile oil and making sure we stay in their box eating their #BetterTogether cereal. Or we could stand up and #ScotRef #indyref2

4097 2018-03-28 15:04:50 Fair enough. Many things seem politically impossible until they are tried. But there are a whole lot of structural force explicitly set up to pour boiling oil and boulders down the side of the castle to ward off this sort of assault on plutocratic privilege.

4104 2018-03-28 15:04:29 I tell everyone who asks because I noticed that my skin has been so much better and softer. I exfoliate when I get home and put the coconut oil back on! I think I like it more because it’s natural. I use bombshell sometimes but it burns my skin bc it’s tingle

4112 2018-03-28 15:03:36 I've used coconut oil for stuff before and I actually don't like it that much on my skin. I've had good results with the cocoa butter, it's a mix with vitamin e in it so it's not too heavy.

4144 2018-03-28 15:00:43 It's well known bee species are declining. It's like destroying the rain forest to grow palm oil, it's unsustainable & destructive ultimately in so many ways. Without pollination we are sunk so yes destroying a nest like this is unnecessary as well as hugely harmful.

4181 2018-03-28 14:57:06 It’s matte but I like a dewy look so I added a tiny bit of facial oil

4187 2018-03-28 14:56:40 My Trotskyist biological father's involvement with oil and gas industry is far from a redeeming feature.
4188 2018-03-28 14:56:20 I’m listening to these boys talk about coconut oil and they are just fascinated by it. “That shit just melts in your hand” “where do you even buy it?” “if I open a coconut is that what’s inside?”

4201 2018-03-28 14:55:23 There was  no convincing evidence put forward of WMD in Iraq and an obvious motivation for invasion in terms of the oil. In this case there is no motivation to make up the claim and it seems unfeasible that anyone could access this material without Russia's knowledge.

4205 2018-03-28 14:55:02 Most people need to realize having some castor oil on hand can help with infections.  You just need a cloth or washcloth to saturate with the oil, then apply and use a heating pad while sleeping or resting.  A few days of that would probably keep the infection from getting so big

4226 2018-03-28 14:52:39 The key IMO is the availability of gold in size to settle oil sale. The restart of the #PetroGold idea will spread amongst sellers and ultimately lead to demand for same from other oil buyers. Trade requiring payment with an asset of intrinsic value is kryptonite to currencies.

4230 2018-03-28 14:51:54 Data is truly the new oil for the 21st century economy.  Blockchain, crypto reflect that.  Data has been exploited by the largest companies in the world , it is now time for data to be sovereign and owned by the individual. Owners decide about its use and disposal.

4248 2018-03-28 14:50:23 For dropping or pouring items etc on unwelcome visitors. Boulders,oil, water, super heated sand which gets into chainmail gaps hopefully setting attackers on fire.
4249 2018-03-28 14:50:23 It is also quite reasonable to expect advances in technology that would allow us to preprocess our oil sands crude in such a way as to make it more valuable in the future. After all, 40 years ago people assumed the oil sands were completely useless. We have come a long way since.

I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.

4287 2018-03-28 14:46:20 Prosperous is a relative term. Will we be more or less prosperous?

Besides the main reason for Norway's prosperity is their North Sea oil export and the Swiss have their dubious "ask no questions" banking sector. Their prosperity or lack there of has little to do with the EU.

4296 2018-03-28 14:45:28 Furthermore, the highest share of oil and mining royalties is generated in areas with oil and coal open-pit regions. The royalties accrued by subnational governments where illegal gold extraction is pervasive receive a small share of these revenues.

4298 2018-03-28 14:45:26 Wrong.  It's only convertible through gold & oil (on a limited basis.)  Run through what happens to London/NYC gold markets if "sixty squillion zillions worth of flight capital swamps the system" in a flash, through physical gold?

4313 2018-03-28 14:44:20 The Americans get a steep discount because they are the only customer.
Beyond that, Alberta has many types of oil, the oilsands are only one type. The Alberta Bakken is identical to the Dakota Bakken which is booming. We even have some medium and light crude left.

4324 2018-03-28 14:43:26 The problem in Venezuela isn't due to the nationalization of the oil and gas industry, but instead due to the corruption of the current regime which has lead to lower economic outputs and less redistribution of wealth.

4333 2018-03-28 14:42:39 I like coconut oil better. It absorbs into the skin better, and it has disinfecting and healing properties, as well as breathing better. Cocoa butter is heavier and keeps your skin wet and thick, causing more peeling.

4341 2018-03-28 14:41:22 The oil and mining royalties can be used solely for specific public investment projects. Unfortunately this rules out strengthening state capacity at the local level. A change in the destination of royalties would require a constitutional amendment and this is very unlikely.

4391 2018-03-28 14:37:08 Coconut oil. That's all I used on my back and it broke out a bit when I used too much but healed well. The trick was to coat your hands and lightly pat it on instead of rubbing it in.
4392 2018-03-28 14:37:06 I dont see evidence of this in gold market. China oil demand equals 15 tons per day, and gold market would have reacted. So far nada. US and others may also put limitations on physical gold just as easy. But lets wait and see.

4436 2018-03-28 14:33:04 Living in Cali it's now recreationally legal state-wise but it's still illegal federally. It's tough cause there's a lot of misinformation out there about what's legal and not but when it comes to CBD oil derived from marijuana it is definitely illegal at the federal level.

Or...

2) go to gas station, pay for gas, fill car tank.

4596 2018-03-28 14:18:55 Yeah that's what happens when you base far too much of your country's economy off a single industry and then someone named Putin goes whoopsydoodles and crashes the global price of oil.

I mean, being an authoritarian fascist also doesn't help.

4897 2018-03-28 13:48:21 The first part sounds factual, but not sure how the Kinder Morgan Pipeline is sellout of our resources, considering that it will allow us to sell our oil at world prices vs selling it at a very, very steep discount to the US who then sell it at world prices.

ManCity shows what a team of Barca or Bayern quality would do in England. And City are worse than them.

4979 2018-03-28 13:41:59 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.
4980 2018-03-28 13:41:57 A possible reason is for improved governance. Unlikely to be huge synergies between oil & gas and electricity. As a Crown corporation, there is also no benefit to size or diversified business lines (because it doesn’t have traditional capitalization).

5021 2018-03-28 13:35:06 Oil is at over $60/bbl now, it isn't OPEC snuffing it out.
5022 2018-03-28 13:35:00 Even more land would be lost were it not for palm oil which, by itself, is not the bad guy.
5023 2018-03-28 13:34:41 I don’t want to get an oil change - I just want to sleep 
5024 2018-03-28 13:34:32 Reasons on call for $CXO to take out $RSPP now were interesting. Yes accretive but also the phase the #Permian is in now, moving fully into development mode, making scale more key relative to delineation mode. Speaks to #oil M&A having more legs this time. #OOTT.  $PE  a target.

5049 2018-03-28 13:31:41 Women definitely have a prominent role in US history, they weren't constructing Vanderbilt's RRs, obtaining Rockefeller's oil, forging Carnegie's steel,  building America's sky scrapers with it, inventing Model Ts, developing electricity, on the front lines defending our freedom.
5050 2018-03-28 13:31:17 You're totally are missing the whole point, you may just want to buy a mutual fund.

5051 2018-03-28 13:31:10 Please tell me your joking. Yes putting money into alt fuels is important but Oil is 98% of the energy we use daily. Can’t just shut off the switch. Not now or I’m at least 100 yrs. consumption is way to high!

5064 2018-03-28 13:29:42 Yeah that's backwards. You don't tax things; you tax income. You only tax things when you want to nudge an economic shift forward, such as to reduce the wasteful investment in oil and coal infrastructure that's going to be obsolete in a decade: tax coal, subsidize solar.
5065 2018-03-28 13:29:38 Crazy how much water we can waste and pollute carelessly. When one drop of oil can make up to 25 liters (6.6 gallons) of water undrinkable. Keeping our water sources clean is obviously crucial.

5086 2018-03-28 13:27:14 The chances of a catastrophic spill "are tiny"?

Do a bit of research, all pipelines leak - any spill can be detrimental to the earth and water. For instance - the Dakota Access Pipeline has already sprung MULTIPLE leaks since it first started moving oil.

5220 2018-03-28 13:12:44 Yes, it's oil wealth that allows this. My point is that using oil revenue as an argument for Scottish independence is a double edged sword. I have always thought it was opportunistic and immoral. As part of the UK it is only right that revenues should be spent throughout the UK.

If the floor starts to look dull after a long time of wear you can use a thin layer of Elka maintenance oil. Make sure the floor is thoroughly cleaned and left to dry 4-8hrs before applying.

5342 2018-03-28 12:59:45 The risks companies will take to get oil... I would say that I if we only used renewables things like this wouldn't happen. There's just no economic incentive to do so. Poorer countries still developing will definitely see more of this unfortunately.

5448 2018-03-28 12:46:02 Yes!  Oil is much too precious to burn.  However, fusion technology will make the process of manufacturing plastics, lubricants, and chemicals infinitely cheaper.  Hydrogen fuel for auto fuel cells could be produced for pennies per gallon.

5457 2018-03-28 12:44:50 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.
5458 2018-03-28 12:44:40 Hi  wht is the best drugstore moisturizer and cleasing oil for oily skin?
5459 2018-03-28 12:44:35 3. Hair masks!

Hair masks are a great way to make your hair healthier and longer! Some things to put in your masks are eggs or castor oil, both really great things to add some length to your hair!

5477 2018-03-28 12:42:09 In Donald's little non-comprehending mind, it is likely related to that oft-asked question:

5489 2018-03-28 12:40:28 Nuclear fusion energy is the ultimate disruptive technology.  It will bankrupt the BIG OIL and render all fossil fuels, solar, wind, hydro & nuclear fission energy as obsolete as buggy whips.
5490 2018-03-28 12:40:18 I suspect Khameini knows that foreigners aren’t actually trying to take Iran’s oil resources and that he knows how ridiculous that sounds to the international community but feels it necessary to rouse support at home

5505 2018-03-28 12:38:28 That’s true, but Khameini is accessing a long held ideological lynchpin of the Islamic Republic that goes back to the Anglo-Iranian oil crisis when Mossadeq nationalized Iran’s oil resources from BP. The statement is geared at arousing the sentiments of Iranian nationalists.

I see adverts for cold pressed High Oleic Sunflower Oils with a special variety ( non GMO ) sunflower seed that is low in omega 6 & High in Omega 9.
   
Is this a safe oil to use?
   
Thanks
Kevin

5529 2018-03-28 12:34:24 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.
5530 2018-03-28 12:34:23 Yes, because frying food in oil damages fats and makes the food really bad for you

5534 2018-03-28 12:33:58 However, if oil doesn't fade or PMI data rate of growth doesn't cool down, it will be hard to get that inversion this year but looking at August here for this to happen

1) pay you back all your taxes;
2)the federal government pay back all the oil proceeds from 1970 till date that have been used to develop other parts of the country to AKS
5552 2018-03-28 12:30:59 There is a chance he could hit that this season...
5553 2018-03-28 12:30:52 Because for many years I have stated that the 10 year yield should stay in a range of 1.60% -3%, now that the 2 year went over 2.30% just any pull back in oil prices, stock market sell off, PMI data rate of growth cools you can see an inversion and it means nothing

5585 2018-03-28 12:27:19 What made America great?

“Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.”

Until we return to loving righteousness not wickedness America will NOT be great again IIChron7:14
5586 2018-03-28 12:27:09 I realised I was out of conditioner today so I made one! 

I melted Shea Butter and mixed in Coconut Oil, Honey, & an egg, I whipped it all up, chilled it to a harder form, and used it as a deep conditioning treatment after washing. I loved the results, super moisturised hair.

5600 2018-03-28 12:24:44 First time using coconut oil was over a week ago. As a face scrub with sugar like my sister does.. And it broke me tf out! Like bad lmao never touching coconut oil again. Even my hands are still itchy.
5601 2018-03-28 12:24:42 #Tarsands #oil more resembles the #asphalt that paves your street then the oil you use in your car. It is so thick that it must be diluted with #solvents like #napthalene, which causes #cancer. Very bad when a #pipeline leaks, especially into a #water #supply. #WaterProtectors

"The ground doesn't typically do this without some cause."

Yeah, no, really, like maybe 'cause' vast amounts of oil were extracted?

5826 2018-03-28 11:50:20 So for petrol pricing Australia liked itself to the OPEC price decades ago. So even our oil which we extract for a lot less is priced as OPEC. 

All that aside, we now just get our petrol from Singapore as it's cheaper. Then we tax the shit out of it

I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.
5856 2018-03-28 11:43:19 ヌルッとお見通しだ！
5857 2018-03-28 11:42:56 I also do the 20 minute coconut oil swish most mornings.  If nothing else, it helps maintain my gums.  Wish I had known about licorice root for teeth when I was little!
5858 2018-03-28 11:42:55 There’s a chap called Elon Musk...you may have heard of him, who realised the potential of stored electricity and has been working on the project for years. When this comes to fruition, Electricity will be the new oil...and we COULD be at the forefront
5859 2018-03-28 11:42:28 this is true.
I have had to sort out the custom documents for consignments of fuel oil.
5860 2018-03-28 11:42:06 I doubt the energy relaimed is as much as the energy of production, transport. So twice as dirty as using oil!
5861 2018-03-28 11:41:59 “Canada should build new pipeline capacity and use our oil resources but also invest in renewable energy and ways to reduce the amount of emissions the country produces”. 

Are the circumstances under which that 68%  was obtained.
5862 2018-03-28 11:41:38 RNS Heid International is pleased to announce it has just agreed terms with ITV for the takeover of 51% shares in its flagship daytime programme "Loose Women". The project has received backing from shareholder backers White Horse Associates and is fully funded. News flow follow.
5863 2018-03-28 11:41:22 Part of the reason gas is so much cheaper in the US is bc we could simply print green pieces of paper for it.  If that's also partly true of other products (I suspect it is), expect American industry to respond to weaker USD like American shale did when USD fell v oil
5864 2018-03-28 11:41:21 Haha! Yes, good point. #YorkshirePudding - The only tip I know is make sure the tin and oil are smoking hot before pouring in the batter. I am not brilliant at making Yorkies but I do make a mean Toad-in-the-Hole.

5867 2018-03-28 11:40:18 The thing is, you haven’t looked into that very much.....you obviously only read what the papers wanted you to read and didn’t do your own research.  When the oil runs out, what will they turn to??
5868 2018-03-28 11:40:02 Kai mallam, or sheikh or whatever u call urself,  let me ask u something, So u have never sin in ur life right? I am sure u love Allah and am sure one way or the other u sin sometimes... So that means anytime u sin u don't also have any link with ur God right???
5869 2018-03-28 11:39:59 Meanwhile I’ve got friends that don’t know how to check oil, tire pressure, coolant, change a tire, change a battery... simple shit

5894 2018-03-28 11:35:40 Dont use any oil next time,

5898 2018-03-28 11:34:32 But they seemingly haven't yet figured out that an endocannabinoid system requires cannabinoids to function properly.
If you don't put oil in a motorvehicle engine it won't work efficiently and will eventually breakdown. It's the same with the human endocannabinoid system

5900 2018-03-28 11:34:24 For example, a sudden surge in the popularity of sushi may have an effect on trade between the UK and Japan, but in the grand scope of things it's it's unlikely to add % points to either country's GDP. Something like the price or availability of oil or steel on the other hand...

5909 2018-03-28 11:32:17 . Way back in the 1930s, Noah McVicker created a substance that looked like putty out of flour, water, salt, boric acid and mineral oil. His family's soap company in Cincinnati, Ohio, marketed his creation as wallpaper cleaner! @BPBlackHawkTV

5914 2018-03-28 11:31:28 Isn’t this what we did as kids. I left Home on Saturday and played with my friends in the woods until dad honked the truck horn for me to come home! We played around oil ponds, climbed oil derricks, and even discovered a forgotten cemetery once. We didn’t die.

5916 2018-03-28 11:31:28 Commodities look ugly (esp. copper).

Not good when everyone is playing from the same playbook re. dollar, euro, copper, oil .. 
5917 2018-03-28 11:31:11 It's made from the flour of bambara nut. Red oil,  fresh pepper and salt constitute the major ingrdients. Very yummy and proteinous

5931 2018-03-28 11:27:58 They're investing in renewables because domestic fossil fuel consumption is outrageously high, which impacts government coffers - less domestic consumption = more oil to export. They're not doing it to save the world, only to make more $$$
5932 2018-03-28 11:27:30 I've actually managed to reduce my meds thanks to CBD. I no longer that pain or anxiety meds. Whole plant Cannabis products including THC are illegal in the UK. The CBD oil I take does contain trace amounts of other cannabinoids and terpenes but it's mainly CBD.

5938 2018-03-28 11:26:10 @ErikTownsend challenged me on same subject in an interview few months ago. Nothing special about higher U.S. exports & production from system dynamics perspective. It's always something--supply outages, geopolitical tensions, pipelines. Just another day in life of oil markets.

5947 2018-03-28 11:24:16 I’ll take that if it means a denuked NK. China are going to be more powerful anyway. They’re the largest or second largest economy in the world. They’ve just launched oil futures denominated yuan. They’ll eventually be back to where they were a couple thousand years ago.

5953 2018-03-28 11:23:41 Sadly, because PFAD is already a 100% utilised resource, using it for biofuel means more palm oil demand, and that means more deforestation. PFAD can't be sustainable without fundamental change in land governance for palm oil.

5965 2018-03-28 11:21:11 Yeap, Bolton even boasted that he was been engaged with this Terrorist group for a decade now. The MKO is in the U.S. list of foreign terrorists organizations as they were involved in the killing of Americans in Iran in 1970 and also an attack in U.S. oil in 1992.
5966 2018-03-28 11:21:10 Dont forget to pay for troops, equipment, gas, electricity, oil and all the rest those money supposed to go before building a wall. Nobody wants to fight and train for nothing. Thats a big reason why many military coups happened.

5972 2018-03-28 11:20:14 The list states only 3 types of conditions will be treated with medical cannabis. This is an unjust and discriminatory law! I had 360° NF/HH. I use PPI's but suffer from daily nausea and indigestion after eating. It's not fair that I can't use the CBD oil (food suppliment).

5977 2018-03-28 11:19:41 You don't have to be a hipster absolutist to think that 1) Oil producers and Asian central banks monetized U.S. debt for a decade, 2) The U.S. helicoptered a lot of it on tax cuts and prescription drugs, and 3) Had we played that hand better, we'd be in a stronger position now

6059 2018-03-28 11:01:58 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.
6060 2018-03-28 11:01:41 However, it is so expensive to put solar on your home. And the ROI is like 20 years. It has to get real cheap to install before people give up on oil. I like the idea of renewables, but not the cost involved. And I believe the earth goes through extreme weather cycles on its own.

6116 2018-03-28 10:53:12 Lol, shut up will you!
Stop pretending you care about the Syrian people!
You are illegally occupying their land, and only to "protect" their oil fields. Stop stealing their oil resources!
Get out! Go home!
6117 2018-03-28 10:52:33 Let's wait for the RNS. They may well have got oil and or gas out.
6118 2018-03-28 10:52:32 I feel it’s worth sharing that @hplemke cover of ‘Abide with Me’ is one of the most oil-on-troubled-water, soothing to the soul songs I’ve heard & I recommend listening to it yourself if you’re stressed or having trouble sleeping. The truth in the words is very reassuring.

6124 2018-03-28 10:51:34 This about oil futures? I laughed when my friend sent me an article on those predicting end of US reserve currency status this week. Folks...no.
6125 2018-03-28 10:51:33 Tooth pain is an absolute bastard. Clove oil is a good topical anaesthetic for this, apply carefully onto a cotton bud or old toothbrush and dab it over the affected area. Really helps. Also tastes foul and burns if you get it on the wrong bit so be careful.

6131 2018-03-28 10:50:33 White vinegar or cinnamon oil. Rub or spray it around where they are getting in and that should help some

6155 2018-03-28 10:46:51 Kenya has considerable untapped oil fields as well as important stragtegic pipelines for Sudanese and Somalian oil (also untapped fields). This is a lot of potentially and probably already a lot of interest in influencing elections from oil interests
6156 2018-03-28 10:46:49 Which resource are you talking about. Rivers state doesn’t have resources? Infact they have oil,(which Lagos has just suddenly discovered) , they have sea ports. In my opinion ,any state that has crude oil and is not doing better or even at par with lagis is a failed state

There's plenty of other implements that can be run off of oil too, fertiliser spreader, power washer, sprayer, all hazards that can be avoided.

6304 2018-03-28 10:18:06 There are some arguments for plastic in that they are a use of oil that traps carbon that isn't released into the air. Also the material has some benefits such as light weight. Single use is wrong as ends up pollution but long term use is OK.

6310 2018-03-28 10:17:18 It is hard and I understand the urgency. Localism, or bio-regionalism, fights globalization. Similarly with palm oil, though I understand the ethical issues with abandoning producers overnight.

6320 2018-03-28 10:15:11 Ever wondered what makes extra-virgin olive oil good as a finishing oil? It the low smoke point of the oil that makes it suitable only for dressing salads or flavoring dishes. You can also use it in vinaigrettes, dips, and marinades.

6327 2018-03-28 10:14:27 In Scotland we get 8% or so of oil revs, PLUS 8% or so of MancTax revs,  London tax revs, Newcastle tax revs, Yorkshire, et al.

Which all adds up to significantly more than 100% of 'Oil PLUS everything else in Scotland

It's a good deal

6920 2018-03-28 08:10:08 Apparently the project has been financed already. (@ftenergy ) But seriously guys, everyday you (as Bloomberg) are posting negative comments on oil or related things. Can we avoid a football like newsflow and focus on objective analysis? Sometimes it seems to read @Gazzetta_it
6921 2018-03-28 08:10:06 Y’all!!!!
@John_Poynter is amazing!! He put oil in my car, got me new windshield wipers, and filled my car up with gas while I was asleep!!! So blessed 
6922 2018-03-28 08:10:02 @dpradhanbjp @PetroleumMin @SushmaSwaraj  Is India accepting the Venezuela’s offer i.e. venezuela wants India to buy oil in Indian Rupees?
6923 2018-03-28 08:10:00 How big a problem is the fracking waste crisis, or the nuclear fuel waste crisis or the oil production waste crisis or the coal mining waste crisis? Grow up.

6938 2018-03-28 08:06:13 Malay cuisines agak susah. Most of the recipes goreng, jika kuih kukus pun manis. So boleh improvise dgn kurangkan minyak/use olive oil & tukar bahan kepada yg less this & that. Western banyak pilihan. As for me Danish suka baked chicken with salads. Cuma tukar-tukar marinate dia

7004 2018-03-28 07:52:24 Skin care routine that i find helpful for oily skin:

2. Toner
3. Hydrating lotion/moisturiser
4. Serum
5. Sunblock (during the day)
*i'd add tea tree oil/bio oil if there's acne/pimple
Personally, i feel bio oil treats acne better than tea tree oil.

7040 2018-03-28 07:45:53 If anything listening to how the American ambassador spoke should deter Ghanaians from this deal.

7052 2018-03-28 07:42:28 Does this include milk bottles oil bottles all tin cans or just drinks, absolute nuts just go back to glass less trouble

7057 2018-03-28 07:41:37 And that's the problem. That mindset is just incorrect. The fact most of those teams have GM's that did a better job of putting their rosters together doesn't make those players MVP worthy.

I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.

7122 2018-03-28 07:28:40 Again, not suggesting he should win but for EJ to say there are 7-9 guys who he'd vote for before McDavid is laughable.

7140 2018-03-28 07:24:15 Considering McDavid is nearing the 50% mark of Oilers goals he's been involved in, makes the astronomical statement untrue but get where you are coming from. Just curious, if the Kings miss the playoffs, should Kopitar no longer be considered?

7144 2018-03-28 07:23:56 Also missing any plan for reclamation - any nationalized oil/gas/coal company has a duty not just to retrain workers, but to work with the local community to heal the land as well. As practiced now, this work of healing is done on the cheap, and cheap healing ain't shit.

7155 2018-03-28 07:20:25 Again, not dismissing Kopitar at all but compare what you just said to what McDavid has actually had to work with in Edmonton. Night and day my friend. To dismiss him as an MVP candidate when he may win the scoring race by 15 pts & there is no clear cut favourite is silly.

The ones that are covered in oil,“exotic”, the model type. In case it isn’t obvious most women don’t look like those pics
7191 2018-03-28 07:13:00 It’s sad to know that there are adults out here using baby oil as lube 
7192 2018-03-28 07:12:50 This mango castor oil smells sooo amazing I’m really about to take it from my mom
7193 2018-03-28 07:12:45 To heal a pimple quickly, apply tea tree oil on pimple every few hours, and apply vitamin E oil on the spot, about 1 hour before bedtime.

7195 2018-03-28 07:12:39 The sarcasm is good. However the anointed oil is made from coconut. Nobody applies crude oil over their skin. 
Even the by products come after the purification process are way too much toxic for the human skin
7196 2018-03-28 07:12:24 Body hair is the only hair that people dont really want a bunch of, but grows out beautifully by itself. No conditioner, coconut oil or organic shampoo, yet you can put $100 worth of product into your shitty hair and you end up with a scalp that looks like bread crust

7198 2018-03-28 07:11:37 You didn't catch it off me, it was a reaction to the oil I'd used on the hedge trimmers.

7200 2018-03-28 07:11:35 Based on the fact their teams may scrimp into the playoffs? Sorry don't buy that but do think all three of those guys should be nominated. To be clear, w/ how voting works for the Hart I see McDavid finishing 3rd and that's fine. Anything lower is absurd.

7210 2018-03-28 07:09:43 It's 3 am where I am so my final word will be this: falling oil prices will hurt the Russian economy, but not so much Putin & his kletocrats who have moved assets off-shore. Freezing those assets is what would hurt them most. But Trump won't do it. Why? I think you know.
7211 2018-03-28 07:09:39 I had the same recently - my eczema around my eyes cleared up in a couple of hours with coconut oil. It apparently has antibacterial properties too, so my skin has never been clearer! I will say that a tiny amount goes a very long way 
7212 2018-03-28 07:09:11 I used cbd oil 3 months for anxiety after an accident. After 3 months I feel "cured". No pharmaceutical cures anxiety, cbd cures
7213 2018-03-28 07:09:08 Wait until good fats like avocado and olive oil are discovered 
7214 2018-03-28 07:09:06 I think the 2nd flower seed is Argemone. The seeds are similar to Mustard and used to adulterate Mustard oil which is pretty dangerous for health. All mustard oil pack comes with a note: Free from Argemone Oil.
7215 2018-03-28 07:09:05 Yes, I love them! Really well priced and super cute, and the oil blends are great.
7216 2018-03-28 07:08:52 But aren't they foreign substances?  So in other words one could use beard oil too?

7221 2018-03-28 07:08:00 This is late, but I've been thinking about it since it happened. I would have preferred McDavid to chase the ducks behind their net. If the other 2 oil are in D position, McDavid is likely to get back before anyone he is chasing. Just a thought.
7222 2018-03-28 07:07:18 Kings have a forward, defenceman and goaltender all enjoying fantastic seasons, not to mention the resurrection of Dustin Brown. It's not all on Kopitar, who should most certainly be in the running for the Hart.

7231 2018-03-28 07:05:33 FACTS & FIGURES: #OILEX can be used as a preventative measure during repair work on land or at sea to directly absorb dangerous substances. #OILEX can be employed to clear up acute contamination and help to re-cultivate land that is already polluted.
7232 2018-03-28 07:05:21 Agreed.   It was dumb, unfair and unnecessary.  But it’s been going on for ages.   In the fifties Keith Miller was said to rub hair oil on the ball.   No eleven year olds too distraught to eat their corn flakes in those days.

7235 2018-03-28 07:05:01 But you seem to only tweet and write about one side of payments made and always slanting in support of the oil and gas industry... this is why you are seen as a shill. 

Balancing arguments and tweets with both truths would help your cause and the opinion we have of you!!

7238 2018-03-28 07:04:18 It doesn’t unfortunately. I think I might just turn it on anyways though now that you mention it and just put water without oil

7243 2018-03-28 07:03:19 Hence the argument between best and most valuable. If we are talking best, than the guy who wears 97 in Edmonton wins the Hart & it's not even a discussion.

7246 2018-03-28 07:02:15 To be fair, this is an anglo bullshit-thing. In Spain it is usual to put some olive oil and brown a garlic clove, then retire the garlic, put the rice, make it go "transparent" and then add the water and boil it. It raises the flavour.

I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.
7259 2018-03-28 07:00:07 Those days when a Muslim phillum-industry wannabe married a well placed Hindu lady and had 2 kids. 
The post oil boom saw the same guy ditching his Hindu Wife for a Muslim one. The industry was consolidating?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

7274 2018-03-28 06:55:58 We were allowwd to keep control, while many other countries around the globe with oil has not gotten that option.

7290 2018-03-28 06:52:55 You're too late for this. In the current California court case, the oil industry accepted the key findings of climate science as presented in the IPCC synthesis reports, which means that the global warming denial scam is basically over now, and you can focus on solutions.

7504 2018-03-28 06:06:40 Some claim EIA might report differently due to API’s miscalculation of imports. Let’s see. In any case, any build-up is hardly surprising due to seasonality.  Also, not that our AIM minnows/juniors tend to follow oil price anymore;)
7505 2018-03-28 06:06:20 What she did was a publicity stunt to show her dwindling base that she is still on board, remember she was born and raised in the USA, I find it concerning she is siding with the USA to keep our oil landlocked. Do you? Follow the money.

7612 2018-03-28 05:40:45 ProTip: After you shower, air dry a bit under your ceiling fan and then rub on oil not lotion. When you get on Twitter to scroll until you fall asleep, the light from the screen will make your skin glisten like Keisha from Belly. You’re welcome.

7626 2018-03-28 05:38:38 pros: they loook so bomb!!
cons: it’s a hassle taking care of them
          don’t rub your eyes 
          can’t have water directly falling to your eyes              when you shower 
         can’t use any oil based product around eyes

If you own a guitar and are just learning, or even if you've had a guitar for years and are finding gliding across the fretboard hard, get yourself some mineral, linseed or almond oil, dab a little on a cloth and oil the fretboard (not strings)
7660 2018-03-28 05:29:20 Don't waste your money on gimmicky oil serums without checking the ingredient lists. Your "rosehip" serum is most likely a majority mixture grapeseed, jojoba, and sweet almond oil with rosehip at the very end.
7661 2018-03-28 05:29:05 Then you should be aware UAE's growth "coincided" with oil discoveries and they leveraged well. It's combination of a hot resource and leadership. Do we have both in enough quantities?
7662 2018-03-28 05:29:02 Do you really think long positions are driving oil up? Oil will drop for a week or two, and return to brent 70$.  Only an economic slowdown could cause oil drop now.
7663 2018-03-28 05:28:57 I’m hoping to grow that while I’m in the oil field lmao

7741 2018-03-28 05:11:40 So grateful for my dad. He deadass just came home and he didn’t even hesitate to check my car out for me. I’ve been kinda paranoid about the oil and coolant, so I’m glad my dad knows some stuff about cars. And what’s nice is he doesn’t just do it for me, he TEACHES me.

7884 2018-03-28 04:41:06 bryan saying "thanksgiving sucks. wheres the truffle oil" on a random episode from like 4 months ago has become a meme in our household
7885 2018-03-28 04:40:43 He thinks Trumps an idiot but he uses Trumpists to sell his brand of snake oil because he’s an extremist conservative, possibly a racist. He’s not stupid like Hannity which makes him dangerous. Fox has become state TV selling red meat to red country & they buy it. It’s a Bz.

7893 2018-03-28 04:38:57 Shanghai Changji mainly develops and produces oil equipment, road equipment, geological instruments and other laboratory equipment. After several years of development, high degree of intelligence, wide coverage, is the largest species in the industry.

7896 2018-03-28 04:38:09 @BullCBS @BarfieldLaRue  Airing and writing an episode that is legally incorrect is fueling FAKE REPORTS. CBD OIL is legal in all 50 states! Do your fact checking.

7899 2018-03-28 04:37:25 the makeup tutorials on insta where the girls are sloshin oil all over their face give me anxiety
7900 2018-03-28 04:37:23 Yes. I still talk 2 him but after I said my peace, he’s stopped with things that cross the line. He’s been my best friend for 8 yrs. Sorry about the insomnia. It sucks. I can fall asleep but have massive dreams & wake every hour. Lavender oil knocks me out but I don’t stay out.
7901 2018-03-28 04:37:22 On a positive note, the team 13 hours to the east continues to kick a** & take names! Just found out Oil gave up 7 straight! Any way this is sliced, the team is a tire fire. Chia may never sleep again until he's fired.
7902 2018-03-28 04:37:21 I put on tanning oil today thinking I’d tan... it was a absolute shocker when I only got burned.
7903 2018-03-28 04:37:02 The most important part of storytelling is story.  Cinema complements but isn't a requirement.  That's like debating whether a painting is good  based upon the type of paint you use?  Huh? That's visual but there's never oil vs  acrylic.  HD can replicate film less toxic all good
7904 2018-03-28 04:36:50 Washed my Beauty Blender with coconut oil last night and my god was it the best decision I ever made. 
7905 2018-03-28 04:36:43 True that. The exact reason why they had to eliminate Gadaffi and sell stories of his tyranny to the world. Yes, some of it might have been true, but we all know the end goal; oil in Libya.
7906 2018-03-28 04:36:37 How about the couple in Texas who tortured their daughter with boiling oil ... can we send them back too?

7907 2018-03-28 04:36:13 I'd ya wanna relax a lavender oil could help, but it won't treat cancer, and your damn hemp seed past won't help diabetes. It's bad enough we have to pay multimillion dollar corporate asshats for simple meds, I'm not spending another 20 on your damn BS hand creams
7908 2018-03-28 04:35:57 Looks like oil ♡

7911 2018-03-28 04:35:14 Day 3 after having hair lightened. Slept with coconut oil in it and it still feels like straw. The awful brassy colour hasn’t grown on me either. Back to salon today. Guess some of us should always stay with the colour we were given 
7912 2018-03-28 04:34:55 At this point, oil seems 100% better than shit water.

7917 2018-03-28 04:34:06 let me tell you, oil&gas companies do not fear nuclear energy. Some of them have tried to adapt to nuclear, but the scenario is limited by experience. They should invest now in know-how to get the first results in 8-10 years, and it is not viable.

7922 2018-03-28 04:33:48 Good example of how #Trump is #MAGA

Foreign government don't want terms made public. Forcing US oil companies to disclose payments means foreign governments won't deal with them.

Jobs go to BP, ENI, or other foreign companies, costing US jobs

Thank you, @realDonaldTrump

7926 2018-03-28 04:33:04 I criticize any and all food equally. fast food IMO is rubbish, in taste & quality but for a few exceptions like real burger joints & In and Out. And there's no denial of McDonald's fries, they put something in that oil to make it taste good.
7927 2018-03-28 04:32:38 Better talk to the oil industry. They support it. And many have started to diversify into renewables. Don't be a dinosaur, they're not.
7928 2018-03-28 04:32:37 BIG congratulations are in order for the Whitecourt Wolverines! They just scored in overtime, taking game seven in their series against the Fort McMurray Oil Barons. They are now heading to the North Division Final. Way to go!

7946 2018-03-28 04:28:16 America is no longer a Super Power, trump cant sit down and be diplomatic, doesnt know who to show class, but he sure thinks ppl dont know he's a snake oil salesman. He played that hand for too long. They dont want that idiot anywhere near their Countries.

7953 2018-03-28 04:26:55 The state issues the currency, but is the people who earn it by producing in they works. The state can not issue money without a counterpart of something, be it gold, or oil, or its number of people related to GDP. If nobody worked in the country, the State would go bankrupt
7954 2018-03-28 04:26:54 Wrong. Islam had come to Indonesia before oil was found in Saudi.

7963 2018-03-28 04:26:12 No you can feel the difference. I cooked them in olive oil for 2 minutes.  The red sauce covered it up
7964 2018-03-28 04:25:59 I imagine a “hockey twitter” expert who knows nothing gets ignored pretty quickly in Canada. In the US we have so many versions of the snake oil salesman because they can con average fans and soccer moms easily. But nothing is funnier than tactical analysis from MLS bloggers.
7965 2018-03-28 04:25:39 You roll to use a weapon on a ogre, you’ve rolled a 1: you pull out a jar of massage oil and start rubbing the oil on the ogre back in an attempt to seduce him.

7971 2018-03-28 04:24:39 Omg. That picture was from the Oklahoma City bombing. Timothy Mcvey. He made a bomb from ammonium nitrate and oil.
7972 2018-03-28 04:24:37 I'm thinking recycle with drones would take to long. I'm thinking a huge ship that could take on tons by the hour and burn off so hot it won't pollute. Could be used in oil clean up oil spills.  We need an environmental haliburton.
7973 2018-03-28 04:24:33 The gag is you can put loose highlighter in oil for the same result. Jackie Aina demonstrated it in a YouTube video about her artist couture collaboration.

7986 2018-03-28 04:22:07 I clicked on this pic and my browser crashed.  That's the look you get when you take your broom in for an oil change and spot the woman your husband really loves with her Porsche
7987 2018-03-28 04:22:06 I have this essential oil that you put in juice and I’ll bring it to you this weekend! It works wonders for my allergies, trust me 
7988 2018-03-28 04:21:54 I have to take Audrey the Audi in for her oil change on Thursday morning too
7989 2018-03-28 04:21:52 How is it a surprise the oil inventory rose?  People drive less when the price is too high.
7990 2018-03-28 04:21:41 That will be too bad but then we will just have to ramp up the train activity. Come hell or “high water” (Lol climate kook) we will get that oil to tidewater. It’ll be fun. We’ll take some pictures. We’ll have some laughs.  We’ll bust some protester skulls... everyone wins!
7991 2018-03-28 04:21:12 then we'll sink a oil well in her....
7992 2018-03-28 04:21:06 Castor oil has been my holy grail product lately yall I put it on overnight and it helps with my textured skin and clogged pores and it's been soothing my mom's psoriasis, too!

7995 2018-03-28 04:20:10 No. Yes. Well, it depends on the air fryer. Always. I bought one of a TV-shop and really regretted it. Sure, no oil. But..... I dunno Asian food taste better with oil lololol

7997 2018-03-28 04:19:56 Carter is a great man, and was an exceptional Governor. Georgia is still benefitting from his reforms.

He was a below avg President in my opinion. Double digit inflation that he helped stop, but preventing us from drilling our own oil was criminal while being embargoed by OPEC.
7998 2018-03-28 04:19:52 Lol. I haven't tried them; but, I much prefer wash-off masks. My current favorite is raw honey w/lavender essential oil b/c it softens & hydrates the skin, & tasting it isn't a problem. As soon as I finish doing my new fitness-centered products, I plan to do more mask recipes. 
7999 2018-03-28 04:19:51 I freaked out because I had no idea that it stained! After rubbing coconut oil I used a Clarisonic, so I’m glad it’s over now I’ll keep all of that in mind next time, thank you liz!
8000 2018-03-28 04:19:51 Yess I love citrus oils! So stimulating and refreshing. I personally love rosemary, lavender, tea tree and peppermint. Lemon oil blends so well with almost anything

I hope I use my new power for good...
8005 2018-03-28 04:19:17 Pisses me off when people are like “the kids in Africa need this”

8016 2018-03-28 04:17:38 I did an experiment based on brexit. I asked the butcher about an issue I had with my motorcycle. He said it wasn't his area of expertise but he reckoned I I change the oil.. So I did. Electrical fault still there and I wasted 3 litres of perfectly good oil.
8017 2018-03-28 04:17:21 Personally didnt care for the toner vs Thayers rose toner (tried and true !!!!) butttt i did like the rose hand cream and facial oil

8024 2018-03-28 04:16:02 Yannik Bertrand picks one off at the Oil Baron blue line, and drives one toward the goal; but it hits a body. They still can't get it through. #AJHL
8025 2018-03-28 04:16:02 Listennnn.. i was not ready. Lol took me clean out! THE OIL IN THIS. And it’s literally every song 
8026 2018-03-28 04:15:55 Lip oil is truly the most pretentious beauty item... people out here paying $50 for something that’s gonna be licked off in 1 second

8028 2018-03-28 04:15:28 Need some oil
8029 2018-03-28 04:15:13 Oh okay cause I was having the same issues. I started with witch hazel and ACV and lemon but I don’t use ACV anymore and I rarely use lemon. No I just use witch hazel,  noxzema and a scrub brush to wash. Then shea butter and bio oil to moisturize
8030 2018-03-28 04:15:13 Salam kak iman, im currently using TO salicylic acid, niacinamide and hyaluronic acid.  And also tea tree oil for spot treatment from body shop.  In which proper order should i use them for my skincare routine?  I tend to get confused on which to use first for the essence and oil
8031 2018-03-28 04:15:03 Exclusive: OPEC, Russia consider 10- to 20-year oil alliance: Donald Trump has, and is f-cking all of us by ruining trade relationships, by ruining allegiances, and by being a "World Class A-hole!" We need to get the SOB impeached BEFORE he starts WWIII. All he does well is LIE.
8032 2018-03-28 04:14:36 Canadian oil sands/fracking in the US in particular. It is something that big oil companies have exploited from our countries for years. They have effectively silence the masses by using our governments against us. The Dakota Access was a prime example.
8033 2018-03-28 04:14:24 No problem, it's just a little oil spill.
8034 2018-03-28 04:14:12 Radha rosehip oil!
8035 2018-03-28 04:14:11 Fake presidents also take money from corporations Big Oil, Banks, NRA, The WAR machine, Pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies LOOKS like Trump is one of them!
8036 2018-03-28 04:14:11 So it's ok to call names to people who oppose you? Well listen up goats. Sand fleas should not be allowed NEAR this country. You are the piss that floats on oil. Your very presence smells of an outhouse. 

White supremacist? In comparison to you? Yes. A white bacon-eating devil.
8037 2018-03-28 04:13:56 I am going to be attacked if anyone ever found out the amount of oil my nose generates as soon as I wake up in the morning. #WednesdayWisdom
8038 2018-03-28 04:13:44 あー久し振りにティンクルくるせいだーすのバトルがやりたくなってきた
8039 2018-03-28 04:13:40 This was just frightening to watch.  I know I have to allow for other people to have opposing viewpoints, but I am still amazed.  I see quite a display of wealth there, the Lord was mentioned of course and allowing Trump to find his way, they are from Dallas so probably oil $
8040 2018-03-28 04:13:19 What a difference a bit of cannabis oil can make to sleep patterns. I’m amazed how well I’m sleeping.
8041 2018-03-28 04:13:12 Gonna rub some cannabis oil on my feet
8042 2018-03-28 04:12:50 I did the same for the longest time and it made my skin feel weird and oily (and I have super dry skin so ??) but I’ve liked my results since putting the two together. Or sometimes I just do a drop or two of serum directly, and mix an oil into my moisturizer the same way...
8043 2018-03-28 04:12:38 If you can’t strike oil in 20 min. stop boring
8044 2018-03-28 04:12:16 Russia is so reliant on oil n gas, without Europe, it would starve.
8045 2018-03-28 04:12:01 Dinosaurs are apex predators even in death, as through oil pollution and wars over oil, dinosaurs are still raking up an impressive killcount despite being extinct for millions of years.
8046 2018-03-28 04:11:15 I’ve got a 7:30am appt for an oil change. Why lord?
8047 2018-03-28 04:10:51 My boyfriends mom told me to come over so I could try a new essential oil and she made dinner and we just hung out for an hour. I’m so glad his family likes me  love them.

8049 2018-03-28 04:10:30 Understanding reality means understanding the world we live in is the product of Elon Musk types-- visionary risk takers-- and not of the Bernie Sanders model, nice guy but hapless, who likely would have trouble changing his car's oil, much less creating one.

8052 2018-03-28 04:10:10 The racism was always there. Clinton's 'crime bill was intentionally designed to discriminate against PoC. Both Bush Sr. And Jr. Went to war because of oil on middle eastern and asian 'terrorists' (that were created by Carter and Reagan)

8055 2018-03-28 04:09:12 Like instead of taking allergy medicine taking shots of ginger and turmeric or drinking things w oregano oil for a cough, using beets for the magnesium when I have a hangover, drinking aloe Vera when I need to deep clean my body, apples for energy, etc. it’s really neat!
8056 2018-03-28 04:08:58 Cbd oil is relief ya don't get high bull on 7

8062 2018-03-28 04:07:45 The key IMO is exporting gold fr. China is illegal. It can only be imported to  Shanghai Freed Trade Zone where the Shanghai Gold Exchange - Intern'l exch.  operates and then exported fr. this zone for oil settlement. Gold settlement for oil is sourced internationally. #PetroGold
8063 2018-03-28 04:07:40 How did the CBD oil work at night for you with the night terrors?
8064 2018-03-28 04:07:34 The oil like data has spilled out from Raga's oil tanker, caught fire  and he is stuck with a rescue boat whose engine refuses to start , sprinkler system not working
8065 2018-03-28 04:07:16 Praying for oil !? 
8066 2018-03-28 04:07:01 Some years the environment and growing area play a bigger part than genetics. Like last year. We just have to figure out what’s best for our farm. But as always we need to keep focused on what end users want. They are buying protien or oil, not soybeans or canola
8067 2018-03-28 04:06:46 and when I see those players I am referring to the guys you did not mention by name
8068 2018-03-28 04:06:34 if u r allergic to mineral oil better don't use this two. but if not, both work. wonders on me.

8070 2018-03-28 04:06:09 That's not on those players. I think the "lack of effort" or "didn't show up narrative" is something that comes up whenever they lose. IMO, that has never and still isn't the issue.
8071 2018-03-28 04:05:53 We can’t forget the oil crisis & sky high taxes. Throughout his presidency people perceived him as TOO straight laced/country bumpkin, easily taken advantage of. I agree the electorate want strength/a fighter; Jimmy wasn’t that. A good man he is; a good politician he is not.
8072 2018-03-28 04:05:23 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.

8074 2018-03-28 04:05:17 i think Trump took all the oil. 
8075 2018-03-28 04:04:24 wanted to takej a fuckingd shower before starting my late night essay but theres a jar of coconut oil like in the shower. Plans cancelled goodnight
8076 2018-03-28 04:04:06 I don’t like the smell of baby lotion or baby oil.
It’s just reminds me when I went from a predominantly white school then going to a predominantly black school and the ghetto girls smelt like baby oil and burnt hair. It was so much for me. It was all new to me.
8077 2018-03-28 04:04:03 条件付き承認とはいえ明後日締めで申請書リテイク出せとかどういう神経してるんですかね倫理委員会は…
8078 2018-03-28 04:03:57 Oh he goes and praises China! How great president Xi is, when he still sold oil to NK!!
8079 2018-03-28 04:03:57 Where can I get beard products in KL? Beard oil, beard wash etc. pls help.
8080 2018-03-28 04:03:41 Your "fact" about oil sands is nothing of the sort. It is a lazy statement by someone who doesn't care about complexity. 
Your"fact" about diluted bitumen spills is also untrue. The Burrard spill went into the ocean and was completely cleaned up
8081 2018-03-28 04:03:39 Masayoshi Son signs MOU with MBS for a solar project via the SoftBank Vision Fund.  Saudi Arabia making moves beyond oil.
8082 2018-03-28 04:03:38 lots of old guys with $$$ in oil. i suggest texas.
8083 2018-03-28 04:03:34 You gotta change your oil man
8084 2018-03-28 04:03:19 No. I remember watching it on TV as a kid.

140 characters is not enough to contrast carter with Reagan.

One had gas lines from an oil embargo, and the other had a month where a million jobs were created.

One bowed to USSR the other put them OOB.
8085 2018-03-28 04:03:14 @realDonaldTrump ALLLLLL the murders... its big... been researching CERN, Stephen Hawking, China... picking up major world powers listening in on my "system." Picked up Oil&GasdigitalTechIndia today again... they "followed" me last week..

8087 2018-03-28 04:02:48 There are a whole lot more of us who want to rally for #Oklahoma teachers than to #Rally4TheRigs. Sorry Oil & Gas industry, but you need to stop the complaining  & pay your fair share. 7% GPT would be a start. #okleg #oked

8097 2018-03-28 04:01:36 For regular cleanup. After I am done using mine. I turn on the oven to 350. Wipe/scrap with spatula and rinse clean with HOT water. Dry with a paper towel or two. Then I wipe it with a little bit(few drops) of peanut oil or just a bit of bacon grease starting on the inside...
8098 2018-03-28 04:01:31 Tea tree oil is so good for your skin but ugh the smell is so disgusting and strong!
8099 2018-03-28 04:01:19 I can’t find my oil sheen and my braids are still kinda itchy and tight 
8100 2018-03-28 04:01:08 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, and open borders.
8101 2018-03-28 04:00:58 McDavid points total the only headline left to discuss in Oil Country these days. Other than him they are hot garbage and unwatchable.
8102 2018-03-28 04:00:56 Oil fans kill me...take a look at the player Blake Wheeler is today.  He's 31 and really only started to come into his own until 28.  Luckily the Oilers overpay their young players so they can run them out of town by 26 and avoid those prime years.

8105 2018-03-28 04:00:37 How about background checks for paper target purchase? Gun cleaning oil? Holsters? Gosh, throw in ear plugs too ... you can’t shoot without earplugs. Background checks!
8106 2018-03-28 04:00:28 Don't forget to change your oil every 5,000 miles and make sure the trash can is by the road Sunday nights

8110 2018-03-28 03:59:45 I may be a goy, but I wish to remind Jews everywhere to NOT buy Streit's brand potato or vegetable pancake mix. It does not cook as it fries in oil and you just end up with starchy, greasy, pale blobs. #HappyPassover
8111 2018-03-28 03:59:44 it was not a great slapstick though. It tried to have a deep story through slapstick medium and the two mixed like oil and water. So many horrible things happened and they just laughed their way through it.
8112 2018-03-28 03:59:35 99.999+% of oil in pipelines is delivered safely. 100% of all pipeline spills in Canada are 100% contained and cleaned up without sustained habitat damage, majority the same day. More RCMP officers hurt by Greenpeace in 1 weekend than by pipelines ever!

8163 2018-03-28 03:51:06 someone broke the dropper on my tea tree oil and I didn’t notice and just cut my hand and face open with the broke glass :)
8164 2018-03-28 03:50:56 I’m using bio oil and it’s been helping
8165 2018-03-28 03:50:48 Thank you!  It was tasty but I thought of a few ways to tweak it for next time, like using white wine and maybe a little olive oil in the sauce!
8166 2018-03-28 03:50:41 Im almost 1k percent sure that some men shove oil/dirt and other substances under their nails and in the nooks and crannies of their hands to indirectly tell you that ima man and this filth on my hands show you that masculinity is very important to me.
8167 2018-03-28 03:50:33 Use coconut oil instead of butter!!! 
8168 2018-03-28 03:50:21 We were tethered to think in blocs and duped such that Nigeria's oil leaves its shores and comes back at exorbitant price to the local owners and better still queue for it.Congo with all the wealth was divided into blocs with generals who work with the UN to bring "peace"
8169 2018-03-28 03:50:21 Really don't think it's asking a lot for professional athletes to show up. This team is wretched beyond McDavid, Nugent-Hopkins and Draisaitl.

8177 2018-03-28 03:49:38 What scented oil are you using?
8178 2018-03-28 03:49:21 Wash automotive parts covered with oil or chips. You can shower inside too if you want ;) tapi x blh muat la you hahaha
8179 2018-03-28 03:49:20 I love putting coconut oil on after a fresh shave.  I just feel so soft.
8180 2018-03-28 03:49:11 They set this climate goals to Garner support and votes from the public nothing more.  Most will never be hit as the population is expanding and like mentioned above 3rd world countries are climbing out of poverty with oil&gas
8181 2018-03-28 03:49:02 ぶ、ぶひーーーーーーーーー！！！！！
8182 2018-03-28 03:48:59 Burnt my hand with hot oil lol I’m hella dumb
8183 2018-03-28 03:48:21 好意には必ず好意が帰ってくるとか、利益には好意がくっついてるものだとか思うのをやめような
8184 2018-03-28 03:48:06 We didn't lose our oil reserves, we are not a socialist country... this is just bad old corruption with politicians like Chavez that mismanaged and robbed the country.
8185 2018-03-28 03:48:01 Welcome to the oil patch Jason. I live in southern bc, work 1200kms north, and half the crew is from SK. It’s always been this way dummy.
8186 2018-03-28 03:47:26 @hey_yunoe lei? There was an accident and all my right fingers are burning due to the hotness of the oil which fell onto my right hands. I am putting my right hand into a bucket of cold water
8187 2018-03-28 03:47:17 a crusty kid sent me on a mission to find his friend “coyote” to give a couple oil hits to because he got ripped off $50 for celery he thought was weed
8188 2018-03-28 03:47:08 例年通りならそろそろ発表がありそうですよね。
8189 2018-03-28 03:47:04 For a little bit into your homily I thought you might use the lady pouring the oil as a way to be okay with deaconettes.

8191 2018-03-28 03:46:39 Any Vegas girls wanna dab some oil?
8192 2018-03-28 03:46:38 So maybe you should get some Crisco oil and stand in the Sun and become darker skin and cut off your dick and become a woman maybe then you can see the world through a different set of eyes other than your f****** own

8203 2018-03-28 03:45:09 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.
8204 2018-03-28 03:45:06 Ideals our politicians follow are petty parody of greed for money & power. Nothing much, nothing less. Evident they are feeding on ignorance of uneducated & poor. Snake oil sellers don't last, but we've got lots. Nepal needs #education to rid of this pests & #soonWewill together
8205 2018-03-28 03:45:00 we're also protecting them from control of their own resources especially oil
8206 2018-03-28 03:44:51 It’s a shimmery oil
8207 2018-03-28 03:44:36 Progressive growing of GANs and a corpus of nude portrait oil paintings I scraped
8208 2018-03-28 03:44:34 When I say I put entirely TOO MUCH peppermint oil in this bath water 
8209 2018-03-28 03:44:28 You can buy the already peeled garlic, throw it in a blender with a little olive oil till all minced. Store it in the jar the garlic came in
8210 2018-03-28 03:44:28 Yes, but things are always left out by mainstream media. I don't see them talking about the constant abuse of Natives, especially now under Trump when he simply gets rid of protections to native lands to allow for oil drilling (on top of national parks).
8211 2018-03-28 03:44:24 It is- I also use fix point in soups & stews, Brady in popcorn popped in coconut oil
8212 2018-03-28 03:44:14 At least 10 more per every stupid comment like that.

8214 2018-03-28 03:43:53 I think I need to see that. If he can't take down a quantum snake oil peddler...
8215 2018-03-28 03:43:47 Toronto has a world of depth more than the Oil, which with so many 1st picks is a bit of a statement about the Oiler brain trust

8219 2018-03-28 03:43:17 I LIKE WORKING WITH OIL PAINTS BETTER THAN WATER COLOR! MORE CONTROL!!
8220 2018-03-28 03:43:09 I would say oil or rate of oil could be problem, but NIS or our @egebio Extend would be best option for this app if weeds aren’t to big or thick. Number is 620-450-4320 if have questions, up early at office.
8221 2018-03-28 03:43:06 ExxonMobil, Phillips 66, and Chevron are three Big Oil corporations that exist today, in America. Chevron is one of the world's largest oil companies. Last year, it ranked 19th in the Fortune 500 magazine list of the top US closely held and public corporations. 16th in the...
8222 2018-03-28 03:42:59 McDavid went full McDavid and the Oilers are gonna Oil. 

Typical Oilers game !
8223 2018-03-28 03:42:57 I be looking like a Krispy Kreme donut after I put coconut oil on.
8224 2018-03-28 03:42:54 Sweet! So when are you going to impose the same carbon emission requirements for foreign oil. I noticed @JustinTrudeau had a press release against steel dumping to protect  interests. Loving the #Hypocrisy from the two #fakefeminists and #fakeenviros
8225 2018-03-28 03:42:36 If I had a Hart trophy vote, I would be looking at tonights Oilers/Jackets game. 3 points for McJesus but the Oil get smoked.
8226 2018-03-28 03:42:23 Get the softest skin ever by smoothing on baby oil in the shower after washing or add a few drops of baby oil in your body wash and shake!
8227 2018-03-28 03:41:46 Won't look like that much longer after you left the frackers in the oil drilling the coal mining what would Teddy Roosevelt say
8228 2018-03-28 03:41:42 Or just use some good lube, as in a high quality cooking oil.
8229 2018-03-28 03:41:41 Not only that? Too many pistons can bore out a cylinder resulting in extra oil consumption. As it gets older it runs out of lubrication and goes dry. Lol. 
8230 2018-03-28 03:41:37 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
8231 2018-03-28 03:41:37 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Pittsburgh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
8232 2018-03-28 03:41:35 When i leave the gym , i wanna come home to a nice shower and a nice rub down in coconut oil
8233 2018-03-28 03:41:25 Seriously?
What do you actually know about the reality of work in the oil/gas patch for the last 20 years?
Have you ever heard of camps?

Just stop.
8234 2018-03-28 03:41:12 I love you babe, see you soon

8246 2018-03-28 03:39:47 You know what’s not the business? When olive oil sprays all over your phone  psh, that’s what I get for cooking I guess.
8247 2018-03-28 03:39:40 We must have stopped giving free fuel oil ?

8250 2018-03-28 03:39:10 Reliance Industries Ltd said on Tuesday its unit would sell some of its shale assets in the United States to privately held Sundance Energy Inc for $100 million, as the Indian oil-to-telecom conglomerate moves closer to exit U.S. shale investments.
8251 2018-03-28 03:39:09 I'm sure they'll find some kind of off the wall nonsense to spew lol
8252 2018-03-28 03:38:57 Oil was just leaking from my scalp today. I was so upset like why 
8253 2018-03-28 03:38:52 I’m just gunna oil treat my hair and go to bed ..., this day was to much.
8254 2018-03-28 03:38:45 Post recession: Oil marketers begin massive workers retrenchment…As former CBN deputy governor begs FG to avoid further borrowing.
8255 2018-03-28 03:38:40 I love the air fryer but something bout cooking chicken in a pan of oil just makes me feel closer to my god
8256 2018-03-28 03:38:17 @BullCBS as a physician I thank you for delving into the issue of chronic pain and medical marijuana/ CBD oil.
8257 2018-03-28 03:38:11 I'm pretty sure I can get about $35 for Eric from BP just for the oil in his hair. Not sure where we get the other $25,999,999,965 from, though.

8262 2018-03-28 03:38:02 Can't like this.  That guy is nuts.  And, we're a service family with a couple of our boys blown up in this 16 year oil war with another currently serving, so trumpsters need not respond with rude comments.  (BTW, yes they survived, but will never be the same.)

8274 2018-03-28 03:36:11 In modern petroleum regimes, the state oil company is a commercial investor like any other; the only difference is that its shares are owned by the state. In Latam region, look to Petrobras and Ecopetrol as comparable examples. Hydrocarbon reforms bring Pemex close to this model

8317 2018-03-28 03:27:58 Haha mine is really simple, 500g beef mince, half a big yellow onion, 2 tsp chopped garlic, sprinkle powdered paprika, some salt, and some dried mixed herbs (I use masterfoods). Mix well, make into large balls, pan fry them a bit in a slight bit of oil if the mince is very lean.
8318 2018-03-28 03:27:52 Best #foundation I’ve ever worn, #LauraMercier #FlawlessFusion foundation!  It has just replaced all my others by a long shot. I have oily skin, & this lives up to all its claims. It’s matte, flawless, lasts all day, looks smooth, not cakey, don’t oxidize, & keeps me oil free

8321 2018-03-28 03:27:39 @AG_Hair where can I find large bottles of miracle oil?  It seems to have been dc'd and my hair is so sad without it.  Allergic to a lot of products so can't replace easily #nodontgo
8322 2018-03-28 03:27:36 This idiot linked mobile data(Data is oil is claimed by Jio) with information (which is also called data). Itna chutiyapa kaun karta hai?
8323 2018-03-28 03:27:02 I burned the shit out of my finger, so I doused it with lavender oil. It kept it from blistering and stopped the burn, but now I stink like lavender and I can’t sleep.
8324 2018-03-28 03:26:50 That is where our senses are different.  There are serious countries and there are unserious countries which lives on loans and oil made possible by the expertise whites.

8326 2018-03-28 03:26:44 I heard that there's huge oil deposits just off Palm Beach....
8327 2018-03-28 03:26:40 No, I don’t think any primer I’ve tried does anything for me except maybe Laura Geller’s primers. But oil makes my skin feel the best & takes to the foundation the way I like.
8328 2018-03-28 03:26:39 Guess my oil gone sit here & get dusty!
8329 2018-03-28 03:25:58 Not to mention the value of synthetic oil. Reduce Reuse Recycle. It’s the only one that can.

8338 2018-03-28 03:24:58 Kristof is working under the misconception that widows and children will not want anything to do with any collection they may come possession of.  My future widow had her own collection right now.... well DUH!!!!
8339 2018-03-28 03:24:30 Why is it so hard to find 15w-60 Synthetic oil!!!!
8340 2018-03-28 03:23:56 In 2003 Canadian dollar was lower than today and cost of barrel of oil was higher and you could still get the fuel for below $0.70

Even @StatCan_eng lie cause they average the provincial sales and national sales into one. It’s so easy to lie to my white Canadians amazing stuff

8345 2018-03-28 03:23:09 Except I never played a version that had oil as a resource. I made it, but it doesn't look familiar. It's like finding photos from a trip you don't remember taking.

8351 2018-03-28 03:22:10 My dad is the best man in the whole world. He knew I wasn’t feeling well so he started an oil diffuser in the guest room for me and put cough drops and NyQuil by the bed  simple things sometimes mean the most.

8362 2018-03-28 03:20:41 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.
8363 2018-03-28 03:20:41 peppermint oil cures everything trust me

8465 2018-03-28 03:05:29 Either way the cost per barrel vs at the pumps is out of whack, nothing will get done about it though. Government doesn’t care and oil people will make their billions off our backs
8466 2018-03-28 03:05:23 Wondering where this sentiment was when ridiculously over-priced oil patch salaries made cost of living in the rest of Alberta massively more expensive while Klein didn't properly tax anyone? Didn't save for the rainy day, huh? Welcome to boom and bust.
8467 2018-03-28 03:05:17 Why buy that nasty ass lubricant from a sec shop when coconut oil is literally $2?

8478 2018-03-28 03:02:21 Oil of oregano helps. I have this oil called Natures Best that has eucalyptus and other herbs in it. I put it in my oil mist and breathe it in
8479 2018-03-28 03:02:11 He must have heard the phrase Data is the new oil. Understanding what it means is beyond his comprehension levels. So it changes to Data is like oil
8480 2018-03-28 03:02:04 I loved it. Many doctors support the use of #CBD oil unfortunately they're not willing to take the stand publicly. #Bull

8482 2018-03-28 03:01:47 if we don't produce oil, 3rd world shitholes like Venezuela, Saudi, and Russia will. Want to guess what their human rights, let alone environmental record is? Even the @epa in a DEVELOPED nation has lower environmental standards than the NEB

8497 2018-03-28 02:59:47 Then however it is, it proves that they can be merged. So your previous argument about oil and water can't be together is aaabsolutely wrong. :p

SURE. I will make sure that you will admit a defeat this time. I'll prepare my armor- wait, but can I even lift an armor.. It is heavy

8510 2018-03-28 02:58:10 We "borrow" from the federal reserve. The only reason we talk about USD internationally is because its a standard trade currency for right now at least. The value of said currency is dependant on how much their is as well as what its backed by. Gold, oil, ect.

8514 2018-03-28 02:57:55 Coconut oil is like donut, 4 tbsp = 600 calories 
8515 2018-03-28 02:57:39 Hey snake oil. Take your hate and anger somewhere else.
8516 2018-03-28 02:57:34 I thought I told you last time, you can get that done at the dealership while they change the oil. Then while they do that you can eat the free cookies and drink the soda

8526 2018-03-28 02:56:01 Donald Trump won by broadly placing the American Citizen above all others in every respect.

8529 2018-03-28 02:55:55 Exactly. Isn’t this the same China that claimed they were placing sanctions against North Korea, yet kept shipping them oil covertly? I think its China trying to look important as a global “player” when they have never heeled their dog named NK.
8530 2018-03-28 02:55:45 Stop making unscientific claims. There is plenty of oil and gas development of the Gascoyne, Pilbara and Kimberley coasts and the whales, sharks, turtles and dugongs are thriving (despite being hunted by aboriginals) #auspol

8534 2018-03-28 02:55:18 If it does get really thin then people that are drilling for say oil would have it the other side by now correct? And if the universe itself isn’t “infinite” if it’s constantly growing I wouldn’t say that the earth is

8536 2018-03-28 02:55:06 It also sees oil & gas demand remaining at or above current levels for decades more, a gamble we can scarcely afford lest all the other pieces don't come together as planned.  

Conveniently, this scenario sees oil and gas carrying on with nearly BAU for decades.
8537 2018-03-28 02:55:00 So, I watched Queer Eye for the first time tonight, and now I’m currently using the coconut oil and sugar face scrub Jonathan made for one of the guys 
8538 2018-03-28 02:54:52 *Spoiler Alert* 

Trumps tax plan that passed in congress 2 months ago has SAVED the oil and gas industry 25 billion dollars in taxes & multiple companies will be receiving BILLIONS of our tax dollars in tax refunds
8539 2018-03-28 02:54:47 Barrel of oil $66 but I paid $1.31 a litre to fill my tank. You gas peeps fucking with us.

8542 2018-03-28 02:54:38 I’m still stuck on the fact Andrew Zimmern ate a bowl of soup in which the ingredients were:

8543 2018-03-28 02:54:36 I love clear proof! I have the oil free moisturizer and it’s the best one I have

8545 2018-03-28 02:53:28 Love you Big Kuz Sharday Scott. 
CBD oil helps. Trust me.
8546 2018-03-28 02:53:23 That pipeline will do nothing for or against green house gas, all the oil on this planet will get burned sooner or later and sadly not late enough to change a thing.  Slow or fast death is our only choice and all the protesters who drove to the protest prove
8547 2018-03-28 02:53:19 Not quite. Quebec and the Maritimes don't really operate on Alberta oil much. Quebec is largely hydroelectric (Which they also export), and the Hibernia offshore developments serve oil needs. The bulk of Alberta's oil stays in the west and goes south.
8548 2018-03-28 02:53:14 Even Petroleo Brasileiro SA, the state-run oil producer that was the center of a giant corruption scandal, releases compensation details.The local securities regulator, CVM, requires companies release the minimum, average and maximum paid to top executives
8549 2018-03-28 02:52:55 I'd add the removal tax havens and breaks for those oil companies but when they invest in sustainable energy activities they get encouragement.

8562 2018-03-28 02:49:16 Too many in AB feel entitled to something because we gave Oil.  Such weak logic.
8563 2018-03-28 02:49:11 "with the likely result of increased production and other operations," Juhasz writes, pointing out that it "also opened part of Alaska's Arctic  National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas development," a move that was  fiercely opposed by conservationists and Democrats in Congress."

8567 2018-03-28 02:48:37 Just use olive oil and dish soap and soak it. It works every-time.

8569 2018-03-28 02:48:26 what mascara do you wear/do you wear falsies? Lash glue and waterproof mascara can cause your lashes to fall out quicker! Also you can use castor oil or one of those lash growth serums to help them grow faster
8570 2018-03-28 02:48:25 this depression is truly kicking my ass. every day this week I was supposed to get up and take my car for an oil change but I keep sleeping in cause i don’t want to get out of bed
8571 2018-03-28 02:48:23 What are you complaining about? That’s the speed of the oil free world you want (but only when it suits you and doesn’t result in serious personal inconvenience)

8580 2018-03-28 02:47:13 "This oil company bonanza was the anticipated result of a bill well  crafted for this purpose," Juhasz notes, and last year's one-time  benefits are "only the beginning."
8581 2018-03-28 02:46:58 I actually was stirring it the entire time, but the potatoes were just sticking to the pan because there was no oil!!! And then the stuck-on bits started to burn
8582 2018-03-28 02:46:51 It's called indifference when things go sideways...this is what happens when games don't matter.

8589 2018-03-28 02:45:53 Russia’s entire economy is oil. Lose oil & the oligarchs fall. They MUST deny climate change at all cost. So, what to do? I know - ally with corrupt oil political power in the US & subvert US democracy to ensure oil remains the worlds primary energy source.

8595 2018-03-28 02:45:02 The solution was to trust some shady Arab oil tycoons whose pockets are so deep that:

8611 2018-03-28 02:42:44 The story says The railways are reluctant to invest in oil because they think it will be a short term market. The reason the railways aren’t moving grain as well as shippers hoped is they under estimated total demand from all commodities early in crop year and weren’t prepared.

No supper & no coal oil. My Dad had no childhood. He wasn’t valued. He respected unions. Being Union was making it.

8637 2018-03-28 02:40:02 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.
8638 2018-03-28 02:39:28 I haven’t used any styling products in my hair in over 6 months even when I straighten my hair. Straight olive, coconut, grapeseed, avocado, argan, sweet almond, and castor oil... honestly I have a wholeeee line up.

8640 2018-03-28 02:39:09 Why does TJ Maxx sell every fucking essential oil EXCEPT for Patchouli, aka the best aka the most polarizing scent of them all.
8641 2018-03-28 02:39:07 No, those oils are from 2016 and had come from the @MilArchUSA .  We had just received those lovely glass vessels.  That's one of my Holy Oil stock photos.
8642 2018-03-28 02:39:01 Terrific review of this new skincare line from Elemis. Love the packaging! The oil & night cream are intriguing
8643 2018-03-28 02:38:57 I just watched a video of someone cooking, why do you lot use soooooo much oil??
8644 2018-03-28 02:38:30 Every chance I can. Ain't nothing better than a big brown booty glistening with brandy oil!
8645 2018-03-28 02:38:16 Made a mermaid tails in my new slab mold, scented with sea glass fragrance oil.  These have shea butter in them, so I'm excited to try them in 5 weeks 
8646 2018-03-28 02:38:07 Actually that was Harper's doing by letting the oil industry drive up the value of the dollar to the point that Canadian manufacturers did not have the price advantage over American manufacturers.

Undermining the Ontario economy is a Conservative wet dream.
8647 2018-03-28 02:38:04 The little treetops are the perfect amount of oil roasted into them. Biting into one reminds me of the luscious leaves of a fertile spring! #poetry #broccoli #adulthood
8648 2018-03-28 02:37:47 Idk if any mutuals know a thing or two about CBD oil, but if ya do lmk! I’m starting to read up on it myself. Experienced opinions are welcome af, esp those who suffer from bipolar/BPD/psychosis like moi. 
8649 2018-03-28 02:37:45 <living bottle of olive oil
8650 2018-03-28 02:37:37 About the same. But because it’s a thicker oil, as soon as I put it there, it stays put and makes more comfortable. Other lubes, imo, doesn’t give the grip I prefer
8651 2018-03-28 02:37:22 Bot please. go take an oil change or something.
8652 2018-03-28 02:37:17 I personally have no desire to ever go outside of Montana, Idaho or Wyoming again. Might make an exception for Alaska and a few parts of Canada. North Dakota was great before the oil boom brought undesirable folks there. My world is shrinking. I know what I like I guess.
8653 2018-03-28 02:36:15 Perfect. You just need olive oil, fresh basil, fresh garlic, Marzana tomatoes salt and pepper. (Onions and parsley optional) first heat the pot, then add the oil... once warm add garlic(making sure not to burn) remove garlic, add minced onions and parsley, sauté
8654 2018-03-28 02:36:09 "inability"  should be "Un-willingness" the majority of them simply don't want to do anything to upset the gravey train of donations & Oil owning Rupert's media support & his Fossil fuel owning mates

8663 2018-03-28 02:35:08 1) selling off money making govt assets at below market value

8671 2018-03-28 02:32:57 I am extremely skeptical of the purported medicinal uses for essential oils & things, so when I say that this eucalyptus oil in the diffuser is working on my sinuses, it’s most definitely not a placebo effect.
8672 2018-03-28 02:32:15 It actually doesn't mean that at all. Guys like McDavid play at a certain level all the time b/c he wants to be the best. Not the best player he can be but the best. Players like that, no matter the sport, are completely different.
8673 2018-03-28 02:32:00 Do you think Saudi Arabia might simply sell its oil in USD to Glencore, and let Glencore sell that oil to China in Yuan.  That way, Saudi can still say "we only sell oil i  USD."   What others do is their business.  Oil is fungible.

8685 2018-03-28 02:29:38 It is indeed intriguing, but I wasn't talking about oil but natural gas & methane. Oil could be solely biotic, but that doesn't negate the possibility of other hydrocarbons being mainly abiotic from Earth processes, the same hydrocarbons evident on other planets gives credence

8741 2018-03-28 02:20:53 Today I had three candles burning, essential oil diffuser, 2 wax burners and some incense going in my house today while I cleaned the entire apartments. It looks and feels so fucking good.
8742 2018-03-28 02:20:53 Donald has his foot up Putins ass. Their oil will become less valuable.
8743 2018-03-28 02:20:50 FYI: @GovernorVA The Governor, Ralph Northam, of the great state of Virginia legalized CBD oil via RX last week!!!! Great to see @DanaDelany in tonight's episode.
8744 2018-03-28 02:20:37 "A strong reaction"?
Smoking a cigarette is nowhere near as bad as driving an oil and gas car.
8745 2018-03-28 02:20:30 We can partner in oil business
8746 2018-03-28 02:20:27 But for number 3..... Depends if there's oil. *shrugs* j/k
8747 2018-03-28 02:20:10 When you make restitution you have to return All things like Money, contracts, houses, oil wells, cars etc that you have taken or acquired illegally that’s when we can trust your apology.
8748 2018-03-28 02:20:07 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
8749 2018-03-28 02:20:03 We can partner in oil business
8750 2018-03-28 02:19:58 YES.. MORE AMERICANS HAVE DIED FROM THE VIOLENCE AND DRUGS COMING FROM SOUTH OF BOULDER THAN IN IRAQ. SO THERE IS A WAR.. UNLESS OIL IS THE OBJECT AND AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE SECOND TOO OIL
8751 2018-03-28 02:19:56 For those players that don’t feel the pressure, they should be moved. By definition you are also saying that what Connor has accomplished since the trade deadline doesn’t really matter either. His points only count when the games mean something. We disagree and that totally fine.
8752 2018-03-28 02:19:54 If the poor, struggling multi-billion dollar oil companies can't get by without out constant help from the government the rest of us are doomed.
8753 2018-03-28 02:19:20 Good point .. Diversification of products and services should be a must anyway. Bur having said that , I hope we can expand our customer base for the current products we do have ... oil specifically .

8755 2018-03-28 02:18:42 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.

8758 2018-03-28 02:18:27 Being bullish on oil is like being bullish on fidget spinners
8759 2018-03-28 02:17:58 What would I do without daily baby oil , castor oil , coconut oil and bio oil ? 
8760 2018-03-28 02:17:50 what the actual fuck are these oil memes

8768 2018-03-28 02:16:46 Oil. How do we clean up this mess if other provinces don't ease up on their dependency on our oil? Alberta needs to change but we can't because everybody else needs what we've given them in the past.

8772 2018-03-28 02:16:14 I am really wondering what I do with the baby oil and lube with the latex.... Is this a fashion secret? I need answers, I need a tutorial @erikajayne #RHOBH
8773 2018-03-28 02:16:13 I find the best way is to constantly flip it. Don’t just full cook one side and then flip it to the other side as the oil is still hot and cooking it even tho it’s not directly on the pan

Well done, PG. Well done.
8777 2018-03-28 02:15:13 I want to see their tongues cut out so they cannot talk gossip and their eyes gouged so they are blind and cannot spread gossip as they are blind and hot oil poured into their ears so they cannot hear either.

@JasonGregor @nielsonTSN1260
8780 2018-03-28 02:14:55 Yes. You're right. The PC s have nearly destroyed Alberta. However, those other provinces are still demanding our oil. This mess isn't completely on our shoulders. The PC s allowed greed to dictate our province's progress. We're still beholden to other provinces dependency on our

8784 2018-03-28 02:14:36 Magic: The Slathering

It's just like the card game, but instead of a duel, you just rub oil on someone.

So it's nothing like the card game.
8785 2018-03-28 02:14:26 Obviously you don’t understand I refuse to communicate with country--mice who can’t recognize a snake oil salesman in front of their faces; RWNs get blocked
8786 2018-03-28 02:14:18 Do you use CBD? If not I highly recommend it. If you dab, I seriously suggest CBD isolate! 99% CBD, it looks like cocaine lol

20:1 CBD:THC co2 oil would work great for u too

Harlequinn/H2 for CBD flower are my personal favs
8787 2018-03-28 02:14:08 There are people who are in real pain who lose their slight doses of pain meds because DEA and government insists they must test THC free.  The CBD oil in marijuana has been proven to help pain but doctors hands are tied so they can't prescribe this for their patients.
8788 2018-03-28 02:14:05 Infinite failed tries but I’m still convinced cauliflower pizza crust and an essential oil diffuser will fix all my problems

8791 2018-03-28 02:13:44 Sure.  It keeps the focus off the budget. The tax reform@that helps the oil companies and the Uber-rich. And off the rotating door at the whitehouse for employment. Trade. Korea. Etc etc etc

8793 2018-03-28 02:13:31 To make especially good quinoa, toast it in a pot with a little oil or veggie broth then cook as normal once you hear them pop like popcorn.

8800 2018-03-28 02:12:42 And if Liberals have their way, the gas will be imported from foreign countries while our oil and gas lies trapped in the ground - bogged down under excessive gov regulations.
Pathetic.
8801 2018-03-28 02:12:39 Hey @Wahl_Hair_Pro what do I do if my bottle of clipper oil bursts and coats my new clippers? I imagine they’re toast now? Would @amazon handle it cause they shipped it?
8802 2018-03-28 02:12:31 how much does it matter that cny oil is medium sour while u.s is wti?  factors such as refinery capacity might lead to disparities

8806 2018-03-28 02:11:52 Teaching moment - this week's #Bull prompted me to read up on the issues regarding CBD oil.
8807 2018-03-28 02:11:47 Bull (CBS CH 4.1 in Denver) is featuring a federal case of CBD oil being transported over state lines. On now. Very timely plot.
8808 2018-03-28 02:11:35 Yeah but I didn’t see any constituents around all I saw was oil rig workers and a bunch of suits. I know if he was working for me his ass better be working the country does not take a break regardless if he does or not. Today is a workday he should be working not breaking.

8811 2018-03-28 02:11:22 Furious about the oil conference being held at the TSB arena, the acoustics are terrible
8812 2018-03-28 02:11:20 I find it helpful. My skin can go pretty red when it's unhappy so mine has stuff like lavander and rose to keep it happy. Use mine post cleanser and before I moisturize. Helps keep the oil production low in trouble spots and keep moisture where my skin needs it.
8813 2018-03-28 02:11:20 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
8814 2018-03-28 02:11:17 I approve of roasted root vegetables. Olive oil, flake salt, pick an herb that compliments the protein.

8824 2018-03-28 02:10:20 That's kind of where all this is stemming from. That pipeline was federally approved and yet Alberta is still waiting for it to happen. All I can think is that the rest of the country is happy to take our oil and our money but we can't get any help in return.

8829 2018-03-28 02:09:48 And it depends on the area. But overall efficiency is better for electric cars in terms of waste if you account for the oil refining and shipping impact.

8869 2018-03-28 02:02:55 Dear Peter. Using your logic, you’ll have to sue all of us who have knowingly used oil in any any capacity in our lives. However I doubt this is about logic, it’s about circuses and bread - pandering to extremists who want to destroy Canada’s economy.

8885 2018-03-28 02:01:13 For my journalism class we now have to watch a 2013 interview of simon bridges -the minister for climate change and natural resources- shouting at john campbell about how oil drilling is good and I just I can't with this mean angry white man

8890 2018-03-28 02:00:56 Hey trump do you know why we imported oil for the past 60 years? We were preserving our reserves for wars. It’s hard to build and support an army when you can’t get oil here.

A line the female "dr", was how do you show people something that works and then you just walk away?you just walk away? This is what happened to chronic pain patients all over the US
8897 2018-03-28 02:00:09 I know this is not important, but this is Twitter after all...If you don't like parsnips, you've been cooking them wrong. Slice lengthwise like long fries, toss with olive oil & seasonings, roast 425 until narrow ends are crunchy, fat ends are creamy. Yum.

8905 2018-03-28 01:58:44 #Bull Benny was very correct!  Why do other states allow it and other states dont?!!   I believe CBD oil will be legal in all 50 states before long!  And so will marijuana!!

8916 2018-03-28 01:57:46 If we are producing more oil than we ever have before I'd like to know why gas just went up $0.33 per gallon in the past week. Is that supposed to be the art of the deal?

8924 2018-03-28 01:56:00 LOL. The headline is: Rising Oil Prices Buoy Russian Economy. That doesn’t say the economy is good, it’s just getting a boost from the basement. An economy that has no diversity and depends only on one product is a *disaster.*
8925 2018-03-28 01:55:57 I loved my Hg bubbler. Eventually I was made to swap it for oil and it was a sad day. It was just perfect
8926 2018-03-28 01:55:52 I don’t think it’s been a good period for the oil from the start, somewhat fortunate to be tied. We’ll be better in the second

8951 2018-03-28 01:51:37 I have really sensitive skin so I only add like 4 or 5 drops of any essential oil to a full bath. Apparently the “typical” amount is 7 drops, but I found that it irritates my skin. Peppermint is also a very strong oil so I wouldn’t recommend adding more than 5 drops to your bath!
8952 2018-03-28 01:51:22 How much effect do you think the rosehip oil had on your results? I’m scared to try it because anytime I’ve ever used an oil it didn’t go well. But I’ve heard great things about rosehip.

8973 2018-03-28 01:49:25 Well I’m still here laughing. Thinking u may be promoting Yoga or something closer, make sense, even giving advices about oil and healthy food still make sense but match maker, still don’t know what make u look like one.

8995 2018-03-28 01:46:30 @jimwelch1 The Iraq war is a notoriously ILLEGAL WAR for oil,  your claim that more than 200,000 deaths belong to Al Qaeda/ISIS is nonsensical. One would think that someone that served would be more considerate with legality and the civilians lives.

9004 2018-03-28 01:45:05 People get paid more to do dangerous jobs all the time. I would argue that oil companies do more damage than the military through climate change, I know those two issues run together, but I don't see people asking oil rig workers to quit their jobs in the name of humanity.
9005 2018-03-28 01:45:01 I'm taking one contract short for now in CLM8 (doing the month ahead just in case). EIA will dictate how I add to that short.

Result: Long term bottom for prices with virtually unlimited upside

9019 2018-03-28 01:42:12 Mr. President Trump.  Why can't cbd oil be legal on the federal level for every state? It would be another way to add to your make America Great. I stand behind you Trump. Your the greatest President ever...
9020 2018-03-28 01:42:02 If inflation spikes rates will have to go upAnd they are reluctant to primeThat's why I'm watching oil
9021 2018-03-28 01:42:00 @BullCBS How is the Dr. O.K. with the efficacy of her treatment including the CBD oil, not going to work out.  She's remanded for the night, The son is released unless he goes wonky over night as him getting hot then cold and not being treated recently, thus the Dr taking backEMJ

9032 2018-03-28 01:41:08 With all due respect Heather, the vast majority who are trashing Talbot & doubting weather he is a starter were singing his praises last year. He hasn't been good this season but Talbot is the least of the worries.

9034 2018-03-28 01:40:44 It's just  leftist sabotage. You haven't heard of that because it's not written in any of our framing documents nor codified into Law. They want you to repeat dumb things.
9035 2018-03-28 01:40:39 I couldn’t waiting to come home take a hot bubble bath, do a face mask, & rub my body down in coconut oil so I’m about to do that now
9036 2018-03-28 01:40:30 A4 I would love to learn and teach about the Palm Oil industry in SE Asia and how pervasive it has become in the consumer world #worldgeochat
9037 2018-03-28 01:40:30 When you're putting olive oil all over your sweet potato w/ur hands and realize that your cuticles look A1 afterwards 
9038 2018-03-28 01:40:26 Initially was surprised the Saudi's were agreeing in principal. They need the money. The US has made them keep the price of oil down to minimise Russia's income. Then the US stopped them floating part of their oil on the US and EU stock market. So yes.
9039 2018-03-28 01:40:26 Today I ran my oil diffuser and had the cleaning ladies come through. My apt smells like peace.
9040 2018-03-28 01:40:26 I c. Unlike me who has oily skin i cant use oil based cleansers. Wow! I cant remember going to beauty spa.. I take care of my skin @ home too.

9042 2018-03-28 01:40:13 I’d rather us not take down a government and cause a mess to clean up in the first place. I want a military that doesn’t invade other countries for oil. I want a military that defends not attacks and seeks to perpetuate American imperialism.

9045 2018-03-28 01:40:01 On the prayer session tonight We learned that #God said, “those who loveth wine and oil shall not be rich. “ Receive the word of God with gladness. Amen ref proverbs 21:17
9046 2018-03-28 01:39:59 That’s fine with me. Although I’d argue that for most players, pressure is still on. 3-0, regardless of the time of year, much more enjoyable when we win. Enjoy the game
9047 2018-03-28 01:39:38 Wtf does this have to do with the presidency, unless he’s a Weinstein character this is of no interest to people. If they were all consensual and took hush money why should we care. Avenatti comes off as a snake oil salesman looking for fame and money, the MSM is disgusting!

9052 2018-03-28 01:39:06 Very sad to report that my very expensive bottle of @Ouidad Mongongo Oil spilled in the drawer. 
9053 2018-03-28 01:39:05 "being lehrer's friend" is one of those activities that seems like it should come with an insurance policy, like skydiving, or voluntarily dangling yourself over a vat of boiling oil
9054 2018-03-28 01:38:59 The only way I would EVER leave this beautiful and amazing country again is if I was going somewhere to drill for oil
9055 2018-03-28 01:38:55 I tried to go a LEAST 3 times a week but if you can go everyday. I did the diet for almost two months. See that's the thing I'm pretty sure you don't NEEEEEED coffee but the diet consists of a butter and brain octane oil which you need to blend together with your brewed coffee.
9056 2018-03-28 01:38:39 Surely I get to say that fixing the garage door springs was hard, don't I?

Maybe I'll put a smear of oil on my face and try to look tired after that.
9057 2018-03-28 01:38:29 yeah it cleans them solo much faster. i add some olive oil to the soap mix as well
9058 2018-03-28 01:38:17 Nothing is better than doing a face mask while using a bath bomb, then taking a shower & shaving your legs. THEN getting out and moisturizing & putting some moroccan oil in your hair to make it silky smooth. GOODNIGHT 
9059 2018-03-28 01:38:13 The first scenario is quite possible but it won't happen until the economy is much weaker and the oil revenues are much scarce due to declining easily extractable crude oil and also lack of demand due to alternative energy. This implosion from within will take at least 10 years
9060 2018-03-28 01:38:08 i like my girls like i like my raviolis. 

slimy with oil and covered in garlic salt.
9061 2018-03-28 01:37:58 I just hope we invade a country with a lot of oil, like how John got us into Iraq
9062 2018-03-28 01:37:49 No I do not. We are big enough to phase oil out and encourage sustainable options in a meaningful way. That China is ramping up their economy using oil, oil is only a tool to them they know and are moving away. We should be world leaders in this.

9068 2018-03-28 01:37:01 Of course he did Big Oil Money's there. He had the National Guard on the ground in TX days before the Storm hit.  Puerto Rican,s. Are American Citizens and believe you ME  they will be VOTING  each Election.  POTUS doesn't understand he's RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ENTIRE USA&Territorys
9069 2018-03-28 01:36:37 With the weather warming up, I just want to remind all you vegans and hoteps that coconut oil is indeed NOT deodorant. 

You are FONKY. 

FIX IT.
9070 2018-03-28 01:36:36 Seems that the oil future in RMB unleashed the selling pressure coming from china , pressure that until last week was contained into the metal space. What happens to inflation, sp if ags go down?
9071 2018-03-28 01:35:49 @RachelNotley I Believe Albertas Future Is With The U.S. And Making West And East Coast Oil And Gas Pipelines. To Portland And Carolinas.
9072 2018-03-28 01:35:43 My Coworker just asked me how often is he supposed to change his oil. It's so odd to me having a grown man ask me about auto care.
9073 2018-03-28 01:35:37 Our empire is fading.The Chinese created their own version of the World Bank and,yesterday, they opened their own  yuan-based oil market.Bye bye petrodolar.
Being the last big bully on the block isn't going to be fun.We'll probably just start bombing everyone,trump or no trump
9074 2018-03-28 01:35:27 Lost in the McDavid hype is that Drake Caggiula just passed Drake Berehowsky for best season by a Drake in OIL history.

9077 2018-03-28 01:34:54 Right! Just like food for oil in Iraq. Madeline Albright and Bill Clinton!
9078 2018-03-28 01:34:51 But you used to sit alone, naked in a bathtub, rubbing yourself with a MacBook covered in oil while pinching your nipples and moaning out “Steve Jobs”
9079 2018-03-28 01:34:45 I wish I could say the same but I got a Suzuki DR650 which even with an abused past just needs oil changes and maybe rebuilt forks.
9080 2018-03-28 01:34:28 Another Oil Caps goal!!  One after another making it 2 - 0! Scored by number 16 Josh Belcher!

9083 2018-03-28 01:33:48 No one said ignore any of it but none of it translates to next season. Sorry, it just doesnt. We shall see what they do next October.
9084 2018-03-28 01:33:48 Don’t wash every time you use it!! I love frying eggs- Over and over!! Coat it with olive oil after washing. Look up how to “season” your pan.
9085 2018-03-28 01:33:45 Oil sands produces 0.115 percent of global GHG’s. Why are you people so hell bent on destroying Canada’s resource sector? 

Why can’t we sell our resources like every other country?

And do you realize the campaign against oil sands is driven by stakeholders in the US?
9086 2018-03-28 01:33:43 شي طبيعي هالشي عند الحوثي والاحزاب اليمينة ولايمكن ان نستغرب حتى لو سمعنا من الجرائم والخطف ماسمعنا اكبر هم الاحزاب اطالة الحرب وقبض السلاح والاموال من التحالف وتهريبها خارج اليمن تفضيل تعاطي الشمه والقات على المصلحة العامة جلب الكوارث لليمن اصبحوا كقطعان الحمير بلا عقل ولانقاش

9096 2018-03-28 01:32:12 Little tip to the ladies, if y'all want dolphin smooth and sleek legs then you should take a bath with a lush bath bomb for like 30 min, apply your favorite exfoliator (I usually use olive oil with sugar and vanilla or lavender extract) then shave your legs and voilà, silky legs
9097 2018-03-28 01:32:04 Bonus A: I was supposed to remember to get an oil change. That was 2 months ago.

9100 2018-03-28 01:32:00 #Bull The government needs to read up on the benefits of the CBD oil as well as narrow minded jerks that have nothing better to do than be judgmental and controlling!
9101 2018-03-28 01:31:58 Yet I would suggest it's the complete opposite. Unless you sing the team's praises for every 2 pts they earn you're not a real fan. To each his own but not every fan is wired that way.
9102 2018-03-28 01:31:52 I put vitamin e oil in my hair and now I look like drake in the walk talk it video and I'm upset
9103 2018-03-28 01:31:42 Si vi en su consagración como @bpdflores le ungió a @oratorian2 con largueza, sin medida. Bendiciones. Yes I saw how our Bp Daniel in the consecration of Bp Mario he poured out the oil without any kind of measurement. Blessings.

9112 2018-03-28 01:31:00 This isn’t about expanding, it’s about getting what we already have to market. I suppose you would rather see another Quebec oil train disaster though?

KM pipeline is the safest way to transfer what they’re already selling...
9113 2018-03-28 01:30:57 Watching @BullCBS and it's hitting close to home.  Too many epilepsy,  cancer patients restricted from CBD oil . It's cruel & unusual punishment. Keeping it away is what should be illegal. Go get em Dr Bull ( @M_Weatherly )
9114 2018-03-28 01:30:56 We would have Trillions more if you didn't vote for the Iraq war. I hope you're happy you helped kill over a million people for oil.

9116 2018-03-28 01:30:07 Two very influential families, Hearst’s and DuPont’s  learned CBD oil and hemp were cutting into their investments in Pharmaceuticals. They got Congress to ban CBD oil and hemp in 1937. People were using it instead of drugs.

9125 2018-03-28 01:28:07 quick tip: vegetable oil is a quick and easy source of lubrication
9126 2018-03-28 01:27:58 Saltines or something in my stomach right when I woke up helped me. Lots of ginger ale and 7up. Peppermint essential oil or actual mints help with nausea.
9127 2018-03-28 01:27:47 Can someone come and oil my scalp. My arms are tired 
9128 2018-03-28 01:27:45 Enjoy away but for anyone to suggest Oilers have turned the corner is absurd. How they respond when the pressure is on will tell us if that has happened & that cant happen until next year. Again, have a blast but let's not make something out of nothing.
9129 2018-03-28 01:27:43 tea tree oil helps
9130 2018-03-28 01:27:37 and just because some people flip burgers and change fry oil for a living also does not mean they deserve a lot of money 
9131 2018-03-28 01:27:25 My first car didn’t have air, heat worked when it wanted too, oil leak, and It caught on fire because the engine over heated 
9132 2018-03-28 01:27:15 Folatil oil dlm jahe sudah sejak dulu tbukti bisa mngatasi problem penyumbatan hidung dan sesak nafas
9133 2018-03-28 01:27:04 Government can stop subsidizing oil companies by the billions and spend on what I said before. Last time I checked it was 3 billion spent on oil and gas companies.

9135 2018-03-28 01:26:58 Excuse my ignorance, why do the oil and gas folks care about an increase in pay for teachers?
9136 2018-03-28 01:26:26 St Louis is not a strict gun control city, Missouri itself is a constitutional carry state, I'm not sure why you included my city there.

9146 2018-03-28 01:24:35  .  I think dollar up, oil down, markets down, rates down, bonds up. Market still following my 2008 and 2000 experience. De Ja Vu.
9147 2018-03-28 01:24:15 Lavender essential oil! Works like a charm
9148 2018-03-28 01:24:08 Don't get dry socket. Worst pain ever. If you do, buy clove oil.
9149 2018-03-28 01:24:07 Those serious about big data will turn the tide as it's in their interest. The world has change.... it's not about the data you hold, it's what you do with data. If data is the new oil, there's no point locking it in a safe & pretending it's gold! Many starting to realize this.
9150 2018-03-28 01:24:06 1 hot bath + 10 drips of lavender essential oil + 2 handfuls of epsom salt + Xumantra + one gram of high end marijuana = happy LO

9152 2018-03-28 01:23:50 Really interesting episode of Bull about cbd oil. I use it and glad to see it in such an intelligent show.
9153 2018-03-28 01:23:44 Pernah ikut saran dari 1 thread di kaskus, setelah cuci muka pake sabun muka, coba mukanya diolesin sama olive oil tipis2 aja. It works! Cuma butuh rajin2 cuci muka & prosesnya hampir 3 bulanan. Tapi muka jadi bener2 bersih dari jerawat & ga balik jerawatan lagi
9154 2018-03-28 01:23:38 Do any Need Refined Sunflower Oil, Soybean Oil, Groundnut Oil, Corn Oil, Canola Oil, Rbd Palm Oil, UCO, Jatropha Oil.
If you Need of Importing in Metric Tonnes, Please do keep in touch with your Buying details.
9155 2018-03-28 01:23:35 Love your videos.  Can you tell me the difference between the ordinary retinoid 2% vs 5% one is a colored liquid and one is more of a colored oil. I have been using them both. The website doesn't break it down and you are very good at explaining these things.

9157 2018-03-28 01:23:26 Trouble is they are not educated about what u say and fear of environmental disaster is drilled into them by lobbyists being funded by big oil!
9158 2018-03-28 01:23:19 I used salt water. Tea tree oil with water also works well. Inside and out, don’t touch it at all with your fingers before washing them and be careful with cotton balls/q tips. I accidentally got part of it stuck on the gem and pulled mine out right after getting it.
9159 2018-03-28 01:23:17 And I’m the other big one who teaches you how to change your oil, fix your brake line, and coiff your hair.
9160 2018-03-28 01:23:06 1) Like oil companies drilling further and further offshore because the base is tapped.

2) Whomever is at the other end of that contract is going to be very remunerated.
9161 2018-03-28 01:23:04 I really wish people would educate themselves on #CBD oil. It's the healthy stuff, it doesn't make you high. #BULL
9162 2018-03-28 01:23:04 I guess @MikeHudema thinks that oil companies just want to waste money by overbuilding pipelines. A new kind of idiocy.
9163 2018-03-28 01:22:41 Pharmaceutical companies would be against #CBD Oil. #BULL
9164 2018-03-28 01:22:36 Where is my anointing oil !!! Cause you know better
9165 2018-03-28 01:22:26 Not by itself. It’s a great “blending” oil that helps your mind awaken and feel more energized. It blends amazingly with bergamot — which is a FANTASTIC anxiety EO!
9166 2018-03-28 01:22:08 If I charged you $12, I'd be more than doubling my profit and still be offering the lowest price.

In terms of competition with other states, we could incentivize a stay without being coined a "sacrifice zone." What we're doing with big oil isn't business. We're being swindled.
9167 2018-03-28 01:21:59 You have to train your hair! Obvi you can rinse it but when you wash it everyday it produces extra oil so it seems like it’s more greasy! So after you get used to it, it produces less oil
9168 2018-03-28 01:21:46 I am what I like to call exquisitely trashy. 

What I mean is I greased my baking sheet with olive oil to make some chicken nuggets and tater tots in the oven.
9169 2018-03-28 01:21:28 More bs from the snake oil supplement salesman. Emma is speaking truth to power and the conspiracy infotainment conman can’t take it.
9170 2018-03-28 01:21:26 Oil painting, apparently
9171 2018-03-28 01:21:16 With Twitter and the conversation I had with my coworkers today made me itch to get to the range. Unfortunately I couldn't today, but possibly this weekend.

9175 2018-03-28 01:20:53 Retweeted Vedanta Society of New York (@VedantaNY):

As a lamp does not burn without oil, so a man cannot live without God. — Sri Ramakrishna
9176 2018-03-28 01:20:48 Yeah, the oil companies ran out of money so they can’t sponsor golf tournaments anymore
9177 2018-03-28 01:20:45 All I have at my house rn is: 2 micheladas, an aloe water, a mini bottle of hard alch in my freezer, 2 bananas, 2 nature valley bars, coconut oil, and my vitamins.... LOL

9181 2018-03-28 01:20:12 Norway decides to stop producing oil and gets invaded by Russia with the permission of the EU. Very interesting premise.

Strange part is the Norwegians speak Norwegians to each other, Russians speak Russian but they speak English when it is a Norwegian to a Russian.
9182 2018-03-28 01:19:59 I believe the $ Alaska gave it’s residents was received from oil company’s. That sheriff was, in my opinion, stealing, regardless of what the law was. Surplus tax is usually returned to residents. In the case of tax on marijuana, 1/2
9183 2018-03-28 01:19:52 That’s ‘world class’ marine oil spill prevention, making response unnecessary!
9184 2018-03-28 01:19:48 Oh, growing up I put tea tree oil in my hair & my face. I can still smell it. I might do the garlic. Garlic actually does work....it's an antibiotic. I remember having no health insurance when i had an ear infection....garlic juice in my ear for a day...it was gone.
9185 2018-03-28 01:19:08 How sad that he can't distinguish truth from lies. There is absolutely no comparison between JMac and the 2 of them. When it comes to the Word of God, give me castor oil over sweet tea any day!! Castor oil will work what's in you out of you!
9186 2018-03-28 01:19:05 Hot oil splashed onto my arm and it burnsss
9187 2018-03-28 01:18:56 (#^-^)ﾒﾗ…ﾒﾗ…
9188 2018-03-28 01:18:38 use olive oil!
9189 2018-03-28 01:18:36 Same thing as drinking palm oil with a straw..
9190 2018-03-28 01:18:09 CBD oil or asmr
9191 2018-03-28 01:17:56 Something similar happened a few years ago, also here in MA. Believe it was protestors who blocked an oil tanker. Proud that judges in my home state understand that people fighting climate change through civil disobedience are not the bad guys.
9192 2018-03-28 01:17:45 Will you be applying for a medical CBD oil card? I spoke with the owner of the dispensary that is coming to Waterloo today and heard from @IAPublicHealth Tonight at 10 on @KCRG
9193 2018-03-28 01:17:41 orange crush or oil spill? 
9194 2018-03-28 01:17:26 Yeah, yeah -- we either had food in our rooms, make a last run to the Rat for burgers, get the oil (coffee) out of vending machines or those who had cars drove to Creamery on Davis Hwy. 
9195 2018-03-28 01:17:19 Pricing ability largely 
oligopoly collusion / monopoly pricing
b/c FTC was gutted by/since @BillClinton

FreeMkt-comp is for labor & small-bus that cant do fraud
BearMkts, oil, now only geo-pol tools
9196 2018-03-28 01:17:13 The oil isn't really a drug!  People cannot get high from it! It has many medical benefits! Do a little research eh?!!
9197 2018-03-28 01:17:04 "It smells like cardamom oil." -Jesse
9198 2018-03-28 01:17:03 Because @POTUS is a professional snake oil salesman.
9199 2018-03-28 01:16:58 I knew she wasn't using the oil on her patients. #Bull
9200 2018-03-28 01:16:48 @BullCBS episode about CBD oil. @DrDLifestyle @CBDivaHealth @u_cannabis @holisticannabis
9201 2018-03-28 01:16:46 Oil spills get cleaned up quicker and for cheaper than that... 
9202 2018-03-28 01:16:27 Popcorns are normally fried in the same pot, in the same oil, at the same time and under the same heat conditions, But they do not all pop at the same time..My children never compete with anyone in your life ,your time will come
9203 2018-03-28 01:15:59 Good to see it go online. Apparently, the reason why UAE is going nuclear is due to the fact its major export, gas/oil, is more fungible, thus its better to preserve its key export and use nuclear electricity internally.
9204 2018-03-28 01:15:47 I really am not. Apparently it's a Nigerian thing...? I tried to understand but in the end I didn't. They said you make the stew then you fry it in oil...sooo
9205 2018-03-28 01:15:41 OH at Philz Palo Alto: "you just sous vide it with some olive oil, vinegar, cinnamon..."
9206 2018-03-28 01:15:30 Tea tree oil, garlic, apple cider vinegar, oil of oregano....there are a lot of options. And they're like, "Women get them more than men because of weight gain." That's a fuckin lie. I got mine because I liked a finger up my ass during sex.
9207 2018-03-28 01:15:30 NASTY SPILL AT OIL GAME
9208 2018-03-28 01:15:21 Because he's stupid and unimaginative. He's trying to sell snake oil.
9209 2018-03-28 01:15:13 Turn on Dr. Bull - It's all about CBD Oil tonight!!
9210 2018-03-28 01:15:11 So buy an air humidifier and put hemp oil in it or they have a cannabis fragrance and use it to get rid of the negative dating feelings. This is wellness and it us good for the person.
9211 2018-03-28 01:15:10 You Should’ve Went To A Regular Oil Change Place 
9212 2018-03-28 01:14:58 I'm also a herbalist - and have seen first hand the greed and depths that allopathic industries will go to discredit patient choice  or alternatives 
being labeled a quack or snake oil seller almost daily -despite having the equivalent science degrees as those labeling me as such
9213 2018-03-28 01:14:53 [The aroma of hot oil and starchy potatoes is very strong once she steps inside. She can't believe she hasn't stopped in sooner.] It smells great.
9214 2018-03-28 01:14:48 Oil’s tricky.

Go short on them inv numbers. Or go long on future Iran / Saudi war. 

War premium vs reality premium. GLTA. #OOTT
9215 2018-03-28 01:14:45 "Just a random question, I didnt do this at all, its just a question i totally didnt do it. But what would you do if you spilt hot oil on your hand. And again. Totally didn't do it."
9216 2018-03-28 01:14:17 Hi, kulit muka i berminyak tapi lepas i pakai cosrx snail essence, dia akan balancekan water and oil kat muka you.  boleh try jugak any mattifying lotion mcm brand nuteen. Sunscreen cari yg matte or light gel (cetaphil) or neutrogena sunscreen, hope this helps!

9218 2018-03-28 01:13:49 Just like the East Coast buying Saudi Oil, with Alberta transfer payments! And these are the Idiots we have running this Country.
9219 2018-03-28 01:13:40 When the rain starts falling, give me oil in my lamp.
9220 2018-03-28 01:13:33 Short version: Cleanse thoroughly after every nibble. If your clot falls out, call dentist ASAP (dry socket). Both prevent more ow & they have clove oil stuff to jam in there (huge pain relief).
For me, low heat on outside of cheeks was heavenly.
3-6 weeks depending on complexity
9221 2018-03-28 01:13:26 Bang gear oil 20,000km untuk auto.
9222 2018-03-28 01:13:21 Again, you post an article which you don't understand the context of. VEN had oil, but not much else. Huge divide between haves and have nots. Oil dries up, the ruse of populism fails, and dictatorship takes over when the country is weak economically. 

Sounds like Russia-lite.

9224 2018-03-28 01:13:02 I just made your oil today and listen...the tobacco and amber is about to be my new fav! Gotta make a little one and stick in my purse.

9228 2018-03-28 01:12:42 What about legalizing cbd oil for people with chronic pain in all states
9229 2018-03-28 01:12:35 Do a baby oil prank
9230 2018-03-28 01:12:17 CBD oil is all my customers want when they come in  thank god we don’t sell it. #Bull
9231 2018-03-28 01:12:13 We allow oil/gas to extract our natural resources and export this product on the global markets, and they keep the profits and our treasury doesn't get to wet its beak?  how stoopid are Americans?

9235 2018-03-28 01:11:39 Oh Heather
9236 2018-03-28 01:11:39 omg it’s been so problematic lately!  But I swear by Dr. Bronner’s peppermint soap (diluted on a washcloth) for cleansing, ground oatmeal is a great gentle exfoliant, tea tree/vitamin e oil blend for spot treatment & I just started putting witch hazel in my rose water spritzes.
9237 2018-03-28 01:11:36 A capacity limit only makes a difference IF someone is willing to engage a shooter and stop them before they can reload. It's a pretty weak defense at best. It doesn't take very long to change mags in a semi auto.
That proposal only creates an illusion of safety.
9238 2018-03-28 01:11:36 lol then Nana Appiah's Zylofon is its Tullow Oil
9239 2018-03-28 01:11:32 
Hold up. I’m reading it has organic argan oil, a 3-pepide complex, & some other detoxifying ingredients THEN it says there’s a more intense version coming out (back in 2014) like what? Granulated black pearls, an ancient saffron paste, and Noah’s fav goat? That’s a lot of $!

9263 2018-03-28 01:07:59 They were territories like NWT, Yukon so the resources weren't theirs to begin with, like in the other provinces. And then they GOT them. So hardly screwed, considering that CDNs could have kept all that oil. The ones who actually got screwed were the indigenous people of Alberta

9267 2018-03-28 01:07:02 It's always been this way and it's only getting worse with consolidated corporate media with no interest in community or democracy, only pushing oil for their benefactors and tax cuts for themselves.

9279 2018-03-28 01:05:22 What happens when the government ( which is what I'm assuming you would want handling those things) becomes corrupt to the point that it simply deems everyone who disagree as mentally ill?
9280 2018-03-28 01:05:12 @kenjilopezalt Question for you: when sautéing in olive oil, does it matter when the oil goes in the pan? In other words, can it go in as soon as the pan is over the flame and warm with the pan, or is it better to wait until the pan is at temperature before adding?
9281 2018-03-28 01:05:08 Oil him up the same way they did Killmonger and he'd look yummy as hell

9432 2018-03-28 00:41:58 Yes balance is key , but sunflower seeds are good but when made into oil the chemical engineering destroys the natural benefits found in the seeds . So now the latest sicence is butter , olive oil not heated and coconut oil organic and obviously whole foods not processed.

9454 2018-03-28 00:38:16 AB forgets about the federal help the oil sands have received. PET (yah, him) helped bail out Syncrude in the mid-70s when Atlantic Richfield backed out. Chrétien bailed out the oil sands in 1996 with tax-breaks worth $300 million/year, those being phased out between 2010-4.

9479 2018-03-28 00:34:37 Due to #climatechange and #Republican refusal to admit that it exists, at some point our utilities: #water, #electrical #power, #naturalgas, refined #oil products, #internet, etc may not be as dependable as we have grown used to.

9496 2018-03-28 00:31:13 China launched petro yuan yesterday. As it stands, oil exporters store the revenue from their U.S. oil sales in Treasury bonds - a process known as "petro-dollar recycling." The rise of the petro-yuan would also jeopardize a key source of financing for U.S. deficit spending. 1/2

9575 2018-03-28 00:20:44 see carl oglesby's "the yankee and cowboy." Coastal elites are tied to specific industries (media, finance, real estate), where as wealthy, conservative southwesterners and midwesterners are tied to more physcial ones-coal, oil, car dealerships. Obvs. these are generalizations
9576 2018-03-28 00:20:44 During WWII a family friend was in the merchant marines transporting oil to Hawaii. Every trip he would get several pineapples to eat. They would tear up his mouth. It was quite painful. It would take until the trip for his mouth to heal. He would do it again.

9584 2018-03-28 00:18:43 I would say that the relationship between a given province and the rest of Canada is symbiotic. There's an exchange of goods, services, resources, labour. For example, Alberta's oil industry has long depended on skilled labour from other provinces.
9585 2018-03-28 00:18:40 True. It might be changing, but it's currently true that oil is needed.

9620 2018-03-28 00:13:48 So you must be a Communist or Marxist Leninist (what other left-of-NDP choices are there?). According to your ideology, then, everyone owns Alberta's oil, not just Albertans.
9621 2018-03-28 00:13:34 One time @rsmtwenty3 got mad at me because he said I cooked eggs wrong and then he showed me how to cook them faster using vegetable oil. I haven’t cooked an egg the same since. So I guess here’s to heart disease and diabetes. Thanks bud

9629 2018-03-28 00:12:49 I see it every day in the North. Retail is down, real estate is down. Economic growth is non existent.
Fort Nelson has become a ghost town. All while we wait for higher oil/gas revenues.
9630 2018-03-28 00:12:47 Most hub manufacturers (at least all that I build with) use Dumonde Tech freehub lube (oil). However, they now have a low sheer grease that quiets the hubs (I9 for example). Normally light oil yes.
9631 2018-03-28 00:12:14 Russia doesn't fund Assad. It has a naval base in Tartous since 1946 (for it's own presence in the Med.) and prevents Qatar and Saudi Arabia from delivering oil to Europe via Syria. Russia didn't assist the Assads in the invasion of Lebanon. Maybe not an ally, but not an enemy
9632 2018-03-28 00:12:10 People always talk about how good coconut oil is for the skin . My hair and skin HATES coconut oil . Ppl tend to forget , “What May work for you doesn’t necessarily mean it’ll work for others “ . #BigFacts

9634 2018-03-28 00:11:38 Except that Alberta doesn't send any oil money anywhere else. All Canadians pay the same rates of federal tax. In Alberta, some taxpayers may be net recipients of federal benefits and others net contributors, depending on their incomes and tax-bill.
9635 2018-03-28 00:11:16 I sent you an article. Castor Oil can actually dry out your skin too much, they recommend cutting it with sunflower oil or something else. I think I just used Castor oil by itself

9657 2018-03-28 00:07:52 Yes, but keep in mind that this is % change in GDP, so we would expect that Alberta and Saskatchewan's GDP would have contracted in 2016 with the oil price plummet.
