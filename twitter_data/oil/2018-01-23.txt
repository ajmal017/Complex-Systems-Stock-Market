12 2018-01-23 23:57:35 @realDonaldTrump, @SenateGOP @HouseGOP show they don't understand how the economy works when supporting tariffs on the solar panels. Solar employs more people than oil and gas combined. Solar is the fastest growing job sector for 2016. You just killed jobs & hurt the environment.

38 2018-01-23 23:56:29 I ordered an "essential oil diffuser/humidifier" the other day and at first I thought it would suck, it seemed cheap...but now I'm kinda in love with it. First purchase from @WishShopping= success.
39 2018-01-23 23:56:27 They should sell the damn oil and for the first time use it to rebuild rather than buy guns.
40 2018-01-23 23:56:18 Hey there have been two school shootings and an oil rig explosion in the last 24hrs. You suck so bad you can’t even send ‘thoughts and prayers’ anymore.
41 2018-01-23 23:56:16 @PuchicaArlette cocunut oil only coats for a bit. You should reapply or use Shea butter or jojoba
42 2018-01-23 23:56:03 If you compare conventional beef vs grass fed beef, conventional beef has much higher n6:n3 ratio, although absolute amounts of n6 quite low. So yes, eat fatty fish or supplement with fish oil.
43 2018-01-23 23:56:03 Sure. But here's the obvious...it's bad news for Alt Clean Energy biz, it WILL REDUCE the number of solar jobs (this from Mr. Pro-Jobs, but unclean no future energy ones). All oil and gas friendly Potus...the dirtier the better.
44 2018-01-23 23:56:02 Oh i bought stock in haliburton & oil when bush was elected. Sold before the crash. But how do you know when to close a biz, layoff everyone

47 2018-01-23 23:55:52 @realDonaldTrump condemned 23,000 Americans working to install Solar systems, to lose their jobs! 30% Tariff on Solar components is a payoff to his pals in Big Oil and Coal! #MAGAMyAss !

59 2018-01-23 23:53:44 Oil regulations along with chem plan regulations have been eliminated as it costs too much money to the companies. Paying off the families that die is cheaper for them.

64 2018-01-23 23:52:20 Fracking as of now is about 5% of daily oil output. If Russia and China adopt it then it could become a much larger share of global oil production.

72 2018-01-23 23:51:51 solar panels @realDonaldTrump What the f@#$ are you thinking Donnie?  This is going to kill jobs, and kill solar growth.  How about a tariff on foreign oil?  Wake up and listen to something other than the oil companies.

75 2018-01-23 23:50:56 That's how I experienced the movie. The mix was so deafening and Zimmer's score, which at times sounded like he was skinning a cat ("The Oil"), was the worst offender. There are ways to add tension without being so incredibly annoying!
76 2018-01-23 23:50:52 Name an "oil" company Puerto Rico, the Republicans will throw money at in "tax cuts" (kickbacks?) and then give the money to the real Puerto Rico. You know they would. #Sad
77 2018-01-23 23:50:51 Heat your cast iron skillet in the oven first, take it out and put it on med-high stovetop. Add oil then add catfish. Won’t take long at all and will be wonderful
78 2018-01-23 23:50:50 @realDonaldTrump By putting a 30%tariff on solar panels YOU AND YOU ALONE will put 26,000 americans out of work. YOU AND YOU ALONE will severely harm the solar industry in this country, an energy source that is double to triple that of oil/gas. No wonder you oppose climate accord
79 2018-01-23 23:50:40 How you cooking them? toss in garlic & olive oil, then roast at 500 for 10 min covered, then 10 more uncovered. Nice and crispy.

81 2018-01-23 23:50:10 We lived in Alaska until summer of 2012. We put up our own solar & windmill on our 10 acres atop of the mountain we lived on. It cut our power bill significantly. This is screw Americans %100 deal for oil & coal industry. He lies like the monster he is period.

83 2018-01-23 23:49:28 If you don't think Indigenous ppl are still marginalized then you must not be paying attention

Oil companies were gonna build the pipeline through bougie white areas but didn't cause they said no, but ignored natives who also kindly asked them not to

89 2018-01-23 23:48:49 Are you blind?
#SiteC is to replace the oil and gas industry.
No wonder there's a lot of money behind the desire to kill it.
90 2018-01-23 23:48:41 Jack up the prices of solar panels, depress green energy. Promotes destroying national parks for oil n gas. Nothing good about this
91 2018-01-23 23:48:32 I suspected Trump's push for deregulations may be tied to this.  45 is so extremely ignorant.  Feel so sorry for victims and their families.  Fossil fuels are such a source of pollution and can only create bad health to future generations.  Wish the tycoons had to drink their oil
92 2018-01-23 23:48:30 I want an oil painting of Nicole Kidman above my mantle.
93 2018-01-23 23:48:23 This is literally the argument I am having with a client at the moment... How do you say, "It's 100% produced..." Try saying it a loud a few times and let me know, the fate of Canadian fish oil depends on it...
94 2018-01-23 23:48:01 Are you asking me ('lentils') if I think they can get the oil out, or if you can get oil out of lentils?

106 2018-01-23 23:45:56 From oil oligarchy's point of view that's problem: no continuation of their obscene profits.
You and I? We see the potential. 
This is their last gasp. It's a doozie. I don't think they can win in the long run. But the short run is ugly. On bad days I wonder if we survive it.

111 2018-01-23 23:44:36 I agree w/@JohnStossel but "solar employs more people than oil and coal combined"? I call BS.
112 2018-01-23 23:44:06 I’d rather be castrated, dipped in oil, and set on fire than repeat high school

115 2018-01-23 23:43:29 Clinton also has a serious conflict of interest problems more so than Trump. I think Cenks point is that everybody is in everybody else's pockets. Big oil, pharma & now Russia.

124 2018-01-23 23:41:36 Probably already been covered, but moisturizer in a pinch, most oils. Vaseline just keeps the moisture from escaping, but since it’s a byproduct from oil production it’s not really good for your skin strictly speaking?
125 2018-01-23 23:41:30 Just watched the show, you are extremely inspiring. Cannabis oil isn’t illegal in the UK as long as it’s THC free (CBD only). Check out CBD brothers for oils and pastes, Synergy of Nature or Canavape for vaping (nicotine free). Worth a shot!

140 2018-01-23 23:40:05 I have extremely strict parents and I use my wax pen in my bedroom everyday. As long as you burn a candle of have an essential oil diffuser, they won’t smell it
141 2018-01-23 23:39:59 I’m also starting a Great project soon— oil nudes!!!!!!! I’m excited
142 2018-01-23 23:39:44 Have to do it the cartel way if using lye. Heated to 300 degrees, a lye solution can turn a body into tan liquid with the consistency of mineral oil in just three hours.
143 2018-01-23 23:39:37 "If the Republicans said we are ending same-sex marriage, but we promise Democrats a vote later; or we approve of oil drilling in every national park, but you’ll have a vote later — do you think the Democrats would say yes?
144 2018-01-23 23:39:23 It’s just a jar of cooking coconut oil! Buy it in the baking aisle haha
145 2018-01-23 23:39:12 What does Trump care?  It keeps his big oil and coal buddies in business!
146 2018-01-23 23:39:08 Got a buddy who sells data tracking oil tankers to guys who trade crude oil futures. We can manipulate and short the market. DM me
147 2018-01-23 23:38:56 Which lobbyist got to him, oil or coal?
148 2018-01-23 23:38:44 So if you’re ok with american tax payers subsidizing silar panels then u can complain about subsidizing corporations or oil companies.
149 2018-01-23 23:38:44 McCain is wrong. It is more than a tax on consumers. It is an attack on alternative energy to help his big oil and coal buddies to continue despoiling the atmosphere. @keraz37
150 2018-01-23 23:38:36 Does failing to drill for oil and imposing massive gas tax hurt people? Only everyone, everyday.
151 2018-01-23 23:38:27 Really need an oil change.  
152 2018-01-23 23:38:11 Oil. not good in a bullish market. Good to know.

158 2018-01-23 23:37:37 It's okay it's still tasty. I coated the pieces in olive oil, cinnamon, cumin, onion powder, salt and pepper and baked it

164 2018-01-23 23:37:02 One step further $chk
also did you see Natty AH.  Might as well throw some oil companies in there too the way the oil recovery is going.
165 2018-01-23 23:36:34 GP told me today of a programme yesterday (?) about Coconut Oil - does anyone know what it was called/what channel please?
166 2018-01-23 23:36:18 Another country destroyed by socialism. Its incredible really, not even oil can mitigate the destructive effects of socialism enough to make it work. Samme outcome every time. Starvation and poverty.
167 2018-01-23 23:36:12 Extra virgin organic coconut oil for everything. Even a snack.
168 2018-01-23 23:36:00 god bless oil!!!!
169 2018-01-23 23:35:48 Bake them with oil or butter, a little balsamic, prosciutto (if you’re into that kinda thing) lemon, salt, pepper, and feta.
170 2018-01-23 23:35:38 Lmao they say it’s not tho since it has no dairy in it. The base is vegetable oil.
171 2018-01-23 23:35:36 So I accidentally got bio oil in my eye about 2 hours ago and it said to wash with water but cba for that but like low-key think I’ve lost an eyeball
172 2018-01-23 23:35:27 ask bob mercer (coal) and many many others in the "big oil" groups...
173 2018-01-23 23:35:25 Is it awful that I’m seriously considering oil pulling lol
174 2018-01-23 23:34:39 Coconut oil and baking soda ;)
175 2018-01-23 23:34:32 so nothing stands in the way of oil 140?
176 2018-01-23 23:34:14 While Trump and the Republicans continue to remove all Oil Exploration and Production (E&P) Safety Regulations put in place by Obama administration, more of such incidents are sure to come!
177 2018-01-23 23:34:10 I have 100+ pages of correspondence between the Premiers Office and the Klan from the 1930s. 

There is a lot of interesting things which connect prominent politicians to the Klan, attempts to influence oil companies, and a 'Black list.'

Would anyone have time to go through it?
178 2018-01-23 23:34:00 Lol, well the Dr's are & robots will be paid for & programmed by big pharma.

I've heard so much good stuff about cannabis oil, I'd love to see if it cures so many ailments. I'd give it a go...
179 2018-01-23 23:33:51 The girl put oil on her face and she’s saying “look at that glow”
180 2018-01-23 23:33:42 Amazing.  Why would you want to make solar power an affordable alternative to oil?  @realDonaldTrump is so corrupt it's mind boggling.
181 2018-01-23 23:33:31 Army Corp of Engineers moved the XL pipeline closer to 2 preexisting lines in the same area. The pipeline was laid far deeper than other 2. All under Obama’s watch. He pretended to care, he could have stopped it all. Oil Co would have complied.
182 2018-01-23 23:33:29 Yeah! I've known so many people who use CBD oil and it's changed their life. I have a friend who suffers mental health issues. She uses it and it helps her sleep at night. I'm glad that you have such a caring company. ♡
183 2018-01-23 23:33:10 Lost my oil pen

187 2018-01-23 23:32:42 Does anyone actually put oil on a burn ??
188 2018-01-23 23:32:41 My parents have one of those big wheeled oil poppers like they have in movie theaters, it makes great popcorn, but probably excessive for most people...
189 2018-01-23 23:32:30 I’ve told myself I’ll change my cars oil since  Saturday and haven’t done it I guess I’ll try and do it today
190 2018-01-23 23:32:29 Cannabis, hemp, hemp oil.. . Are you aware of the cancer act
191 2018-01-23 23:32:21 Cantu Oil is life
192 2018-01-23 23:32:01 My jeep is over here like "Hi my name is Clifford. I need an oil change & one of my tires is low. Oh and did I mention I have no gas" 
Me: I'm failing as a mother right now
193 2018-01-23 23:31:49 You mean lie. Drumpf and truth are like oil and water
194 2018-01-23 23:31:48 The US doesn't nervously go after oil, we do that shit boldly.
195 2018-01-23 23:31:47 Tryna make me feel bad about something I am not wrong in is like tryna get oil and water to mix.... it may look like it’s happening but it doesn’t do shit
196 2018-01-23 23:31:40 Dumped the rest of my peppermint oil into the burner and I forgot my last candle burnt out 
197 2018-01-23 23:31:17 Chop or shred, steam. Meanwhile saute ginger & garlic (optional) in neutral oil; add cooked kale. Saute for a bit, add soy sauce or equivalent. Add toasted sesame oil (regular or with chili). Plate, sprinkle toasted sesame seeds. Eat.
198 2018-01-23 23:31:05 Like wtf else do you want from me I just gave you oil and antifreeze and gas bitch what's next tires ? 
199 2018-01-23 23:31:03 —was the ocean.

"I won't let my words alone be the pen on the paper of our arrangement, I'll let the blood and oil be that."
200 2018-01-23 23:31:00 Wasn’t there also an oil rig explosion in Oklahoma?
201 2018-01-23 23:30:36 While Trump and Republicans continue to scrap Oil Exploration and Production (E&P) Safety Regulations, more of such incidents are sure to come.
202 2018-01-23 23:30:14 I think it’s an excellent idea.  We don’t want our energy productioncapacity to be any more dependent on foreign sources than necessary.

Surely we learned from that mistake with oil...
203 2018-01-23 23:30:03 Racenet got back to me and said upcoming runners and recent results will be added the next couple of days. The squeeky wheel gets the oil lads!
204 2018-01-23 23:29:57 Code compliance guy presented in a meeting I was in this morning about how honey oil is made with butane. I always assumed the butane was used to heat something. It's not. It's released. Unspent. Into the air. Get it together, people, that's insanely dangerous.
205 2018-01-23 23:29:46 ?????? Slice in half lengthwise, lightly brush with olive oil, bake at 350 for 20-35 minutes ??????
206 2018-01-23 23:29:46 The solar power industry in the USA currently _employs more people than the oil, natural gas, and coal industries combined_ - and, again, it currently outcompetes them in a fair market.

Trump et al. are deliberately sabotaging cleaner power.  Don't accept that.
207 2018-01-23 23:29:31 Also took note of Saudi OPEC oil output over the past few years which basically kill shot our booming fracking industry.
208 2018-01-23 23:28:59 Sautéed till soft with garlic, olive oil then add to ricotta mixture for stuffed shells.
209 2018-01-23 23:28:56 Why does the World just sit back and watch while millions die horrible, violent deaths in African Countries? Is it because there is no oil to fight for? I don't understand!#AfricanCivilWar
210 2018-01-23 23:28:48 Solar employs so many more people than oil and coal combined that obviously trump needed to put a stop to that momentum ASAP.
211 2018-01-23 23:28:44 Simples, solar energy firms don't fund/support/donate/lobby GOP senators/Trump the way oil/gas do
212 2018-01-23 23:28:42 Um, we don't have oil in Panama 
213 2018-01-23 23:28:37 Oil is generally non-renewable, it makes sense to import that rather than using our own.

These are manufactured goods, we can have the domestic production and so we should.
214 2018-01-23 23:28:36 it’s better than it being blonde we just gotta give him so black castor oil
215 2018-01-23 23:28:26 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Trump has imposed a 30% tariff on solar panels virtually killing the solar industry. Solar employs more people than coal/oil combined. This decision will cause the loss of roughly 23,000 American jobs this year alone.
216 2018-01-23 23:28:24 No, Maduro es la continuación de Chávez si no lee el plan de la patria hecho por Chávez, solo que Chávez tuvo oil a mas de 100$ y si peco en la ilegalidad lo que pasa es que tenia apoyo, pero todo cambio, sobretodo quien esta hoy en The White House.
217 2018-01-23 23:28:11 He wants world to remain tethered to filthy oil for benefit of Vlad, Tex Drillerson, et al. Alt energy threatens oligarchy.
218 2018-01-23 23:28:10 I deal with chronic pain every minute of every day and it's been getting unbearable again do I try cbd oil 
(it's completely legal in California and I'm of age)
219 2018-01-23 23:28:08 So today I made beans without palm oil for the first time, and didn't add a lot of things I normally would have, and it turned out really nice, but it took me almost 6 hours the curse of living in the Mediterranean (salt water)
220 2018-01-23 23:27:53 It's not chicken, it's unicorn, or UniQuorn. There's a secret farm on a remote Scottish island where they bread them. The #SNP are behind it and @NicolaSturgeon has shares in it, that's what they plan to fill the financial hole left by oil with after independence.
221 2018-01-23 23:27:42 They had something in common.....oil

223 2018-01-23 23:27:19 Pax is actually a really good company. Those little pods they got are dope to me. Does pax actually make oil tho? I thought they were just a vape company.. like they make the pens n shit

226 2018-01-23 23:27:12 Site C is to power the oil and gas industry. We subsidize it. Super.
227 2018-01-23 23:27:05 Likely weather related refinery outages, last week.  Cushing continues to push oil, but southern refineries do not draw feed stock.  One fuzzy data point (considering weather), does not a trend make.  A couple of weeks ago production saw a weather related decrease, wasn't a trend
228 2018-01-23 23:26:59 I just spilled olive oil all over my phone while making tzatsiki and now my limited edition haunted mansion iPhone case won't come off so I can extract the oil from my phone's innards.

237 2018-01-23 23:26:08 Motor oil.
238 2018-01-23 23:25:48 Trump is just too stupid to understand all of the implications of tariffs.  What is worse, he does not even care.  He simply wants to preserve oil and coal - two old technologies.  He thinks like an old man and has no idea of the future implications.
239 2018-01-23 23:25:47 Mine have been so so bad for years and I’m dead self conscious but I think that toner and the kiehls midnight recovery oil works wonders for them 
240 2018-01-23 23:25:47 Micellar water is the new coconut oil
241 2018-01-23 23:25:47 Really?  Because the tax payers have been paying corporate welfare to oil companies for many years.
242 2018-01-23 23:25:47 PSA: everyone use coconut oil to shave instead of whatever the hell you're using
243 2018-01-23 23:25:45 Wahhabism is a sect like KKK or right wing Zionism but jacked up with money and oil. Only they know and own the Truth. Islam right now is in their Middle Ages. It will take a very long time until they have a Renaissance.

247 2018-01-23 23:25:26 You don’t even know which minerals you are referring to. It’s *cobalt* in regards to phones btw. and actually we are just using all of the Congo’s before we cut into our own supply because they sell it SO CHEAP! Like with the Saudis and their oil.
248 2018-01-23 23:25:18 Kale pesto. Raw kale, parmesan cheese,  garlic, olive oil in a Vitamix. Add a little brown sugar to offset the natural bitterness of the kale. Toss with pasta. Yum!

250 2018-01-23 23:25:05 Who are the ppl that lootd Nigeria?. The reality on ground is Nigeria is BROKE. Who are the Oil marketers hoarding fuel? They're our relatives and friends.

251 2018-01-23 23:25:05 Small joys:  Checked my oil tank today expecting it to be almost empty and still had over half!

253 2018-01-23 23:24:54 Thanks!  It's a little oil on linen painting
254 2018-01-23 23:24:54 Kale, some basil, olive oil, Parmesan,  toasted pine nuts (or walnuts), garlic, lemon in a blender to make pesto. Slather onto pasta and veggies.  If you want to go vegan, scrap Parmesan, add raw cashews and nutritional yeast.

258 2018-01-23 23:24:41 I need an oil change 
259 2018-01-23 23:24:34 Well that was fast. Got the NFW from HC today. No commercial oil imports allowed. LP's only by special permit per import and they can't resell the product. WTF?
260 2018-01-23 23:24:28 It’s bacon, mushrooms, onion, garlic, a bit of chilli, tons of parsley, spinach, bit of cream, olive oil, pepper. V easy and delicious :D
261 2018-01-23 23:24:15 Any way related to oil exploration, drilling?

270 2018-01-23 23:22:58 @SEIA Watch very carefully what this presi will be invested in aft he leaves offce; I'll guess, OIL! He has virtually given the fossil fuels industry a blank check the last 12 mos. He is setting up his family nest egg to chg from real estate to oil. Watch closely. Sorry solar.

281 2018-01-23 23:21:54 Drawdowns by commercials is real enough, but much of it migrated downstream (eg China stashed 800m bbl in 3 yrs). Much financial oil demand by funds was met by prepaid #DarkInventory (cf Enron) & created two tier #CryptoMarket

288 2018-01-23 23:21:14 It is a type of bulgogi sauce my mother used to make I altered a little over time when attempting to recreate the taste; mainly starch water (from rice), Korean fermented chili paste, soysauce, ginger/garlic and sesame oil
289 2018-01-23 23:21:00 i like how someone posted looking for anxiety pills for their pain. all the replies were cbd oil! essential oils! microdose psilocybin! lol like foh w your pharmabullshit eat some plants and fungus
290 2018-01-23 23:20:48 Man arrested after threatening CNN anchors.                                       School shooting - 2 dead 15 injured.      Oil Rig exploded in Ok - 5 dead.              @realDonaldTrump tweets about fake news and his win in the senate
291 2018-01-23 23:20:35 @kumailn 

very true about this recipe,
  
then again, i’d eat anything roasted in oil & garlic 
      _especially_ walnut oil
292 2018-01-23 23:20:19 I believe you. But Alaska has revenue from oil that many states do not have. For instance, Iowa. Could Iowa, being a major grower, exporter, of corn, do the same thing? Or my state, Arizona. Where does the revenue come from to pay a basic income for residents?
293 2018-01-23 23:20:18 Considering the US (capitalism) supports literal neo-NAZIs in Ukraine (25% of the worlds natural gas, oil pipelines for Russia), supported the Taliban (Afghanistan, oil pipeline route, minerals, opiods), supported Bin Laden (Afghanistan against the Soviets) why can't you see
294 2018-01-23 23:20:00 ステージ見たときにとても違和感があったのはその辺なのなぁ…と脱退報告見て思うなど。
295 2018-01-23 23:19:56 Is this a salad?
 raisins 
chocolate syrup 
nuts 
olive oil
296 2018-01-23 23:19:45 That moment your grandpa always wants to take his car to jiffy lube and pay 100$ for an oil change when i can do it at home for 35$ with the same oil....
297 2018-01-23 23:19:37 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。
298 2018-01-23 23:19:36 #tradewar So, helping out American solar panel mfrs is screwing the solar panel installers... but it's about JOBS- right? ARE WE gonna have a tariff on Saudi OIL to support American oil producers? More people will DRILL, if the price goes up! JOBS! ^..^
299 2018-01-23 23:19:36 @SRuhle an addendum to your tariff story. It’s not about oil or coal.
300 2018-01-23 23:19:32 accidentally dumped zen blend essential oil on my hand before i teach restorative - WE BOUT TO ZEN TF OUT
301 2018-01-23 23:19:32 Massage a few drops of coconut oil around the eyes to get rid off dark circles.
302 2018-01-23 23:19:07 (#^-^)ﾒﾗ…ﾒﾗ…ﾒﾗ…
303 2018-01-23 23:19:01 Hope it is canceled soon! Scary stuff! (And they want to drill for oil off-shore. On a fault zone? Not a good idea.) Hope all stays well at your home. I'm on the east side of the mts, so feeling safe over here.
304 2018-01-23 23:18:47 Try putting coconut or castor oil on them. It helps!
305 2018-01-23 23:18:45 Alcohol or argan oil
306 2018-01-23 23:18:43 This one time when I was a restaurant manager, a cook literally emptied the oil from all of our fryers while we were still busy... like WHY?
307 2018-01-23 23:18:41 Lamp oil, rope, bombs? You want it? It's yours, my friend, as long as you have enough rubies.
308 2018-01-23 23:18:10 Pmsl Super sub mate on the bench again but but bet u have plenty of and oil waste your football career  to sit on the bench pal to take the pounds
309 2018-01-23 23:18:04 Filthy rich fossil fuel profiteers want to stunt solar for their own profit. They also want time to get their blood money out of oil and coal and set themselves up to hog solar profits.
310 2018-01-23 23:18:03 Big oil loves Trump.  Sec. Of State is an Exxon man. Probably owns millions of shares of Exxon.
311 2018-01-23 23:18:01 Trump would like to drill for oil on the Georgia coast. And Governor Deal's response was he don't think there is any reason to drill, excellent replay.
312 2018-01-23 23:17:59 Fuck that and fuck you. Solar is about being progressive. If the industry leaders cant forego a little profit to save those jobs then youre no better than oil and coal or the republicans that support them. @WeHaveThePwr
313 2018-01-23 23:17:57 Snake oil salesman at it again.....  hopefully his electorate will wise up to his hyperventilating tactics and bypass him at the next election - he’s only holding on by his fingernails anyway, just a gentle press on those fingers and he’ll let go.....
314 2018-01-23 23:17:54 Fairy snuff but there were plenty of well paid oil jobs in Aberdeen tho. I do not agree in any way with the way the oil’s been handled here but it has made lots of money for lots of locals.
315 2018-01-23 23:17:48 Deregulation has nothing to do with this .. do you have any experience with an oil rig
316 2018-01-23 23:17:29 Nah but I think the oil will last me cause it’s 30 oz lol
317 2018-01-23 23:17:29 Who are the corrupt Oil marketers? They're our friends and relatives. Lets stop the hypocrisy.
318 2018-01-23 23:17:23 NATO been provoking Russian bear to #War for 2yrs +. US/UK/UN not happy that their globalist greed for more oil & geopolitical manouevring has been stymied by the Russians.
319 2018-01-23 23:17:21 Unfortunately Trump's motivation is to further the oil industry for profit and the coal industry to please his base. 
#solar #solartariff
320 2018-01-23 23:17:17 Would you welcome oil workers too? Asking for a friend.
321 2018-01-23 23:17:09 @MadMoneyOnCNBC @jimcramer if or when Saudi Aramco completes their IPO, do you expect a sell off in XOM & CVX as money allocated to the oil sector switches to the newly public company? #StocksCreateWealth
322 2018-01-23 23:17:06 We don’t subsidize oil or Coal anywhere near as much as we subsidize renewables. Not even half.
323 2018-01-23 23:17:04 Hoi! Good and not so good, good because the US is independent, not so good because how long will it last? Plus fracturing and schale oil are not environmentally the best ever. Still amazing that you’re nation is achieving more barrels then opec 
324 2018-01-23 23:17:04 i can’t take you seriously if your beauty routine consists of you moisturizing with coconut oil..
325 2018-01-23 23:16:56 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
326 2018-01-23 23:16:48 Ahhh, eating a fish burger off an oil saturated wooden board and chips out of a rusty tin. Waiheke, the jewel in NZ’s crown. Love summer. #wewantplates
327 2018-01-23 23:16:46 Slice it up super thin, dice some green apples, dress with a simple vinaigrette. (ACV + avocado oil?) Massage the kale with the dressing before you add the apples.
328 2018-01-23 23:16:28 Bill is boss he sells oil 
329 2018-01-23 23:16:26 Propping up two dying industries...oil and coal.
330 2018-01-23 23:16:24 You need medication. Blaming the GOP for every single problem that comes up hurts your cause and makes you look like an idiot. Oil drilling in Oklahoma has nothing to do with Pruitt. Accidents happen and your disrespect for these people and their families is beyond comprehension.
331 2018-01-23 23:16:14 Why would it be only morons believe what these snake oil salesmen are pushing
332 2018-01-23 23:16:07 Employs more than coal and oil. And provide < 1/20th of the energy. Doesn't sound very efficient
333 2018-01-23 23:16:05 @Jason hello Jason. I am Victor. Representative of a Oil Company in United States. We are looking for a Equity & Joint Venture partner for a Oil Refinery in U.S. Net Revenue will be of 125 MM per year.. Please reply me ASAP
334 2018-01-23 23:16:00 I heard Bio Oil is really good. I need to get it.
335 2018-01-23 23:15:58 They come with the normal powder flavour packets & an oil, I usually add chilli oil to it too  they’re literally the same price as super noddles but you usually find them in connivence stores or oriental supermarkets
336 2018-01-23 23:15:57 Peppermint halo essential oil from Saje, Works wonders!! That’s the only thing I use for headaches 
337 2018-01-23 23:15:42 so omg I had to make this one hour oil portrait and ??? it was so fun to make something that looks weird but on purpose like it's the furthest thing from my usual style but the thing I'm the happiest making in a while
338 2018-01-23 23:15:06 Bitch if you already know that your buggy is leaking oil why the fuck would you park in my driveway? 
339 2018-01-23 23:14:32 The trend on the chart seems to follow the price of oil. Interesting...
340 2018-01-23 23:14:24 How much did #Iraq cost, can take that off for a start....and #Trident and I’m sure oil & gas is distributed fairly population rather than geographical....yeah best let Westminster take care of things for us 
341 2018-01-23 23:14:22 Try them tossed in olive oil and roasted. Like candy!
342 2018-01-23 23:14:21 Just as Kurdistan loses the capability to sell oil.
343 2018-01-23 23:13:57 Substitute olive oil ( I always mix the two for cookies;)
344 2018-01-23 23:13:49 Maroon is playing better lately, if he keeps it going any chance Oil can get a 1st rd pick for him??  Should be at least 2nd rd pick I would think
345 2018-01-23 23:13:48 yalllll should i get the farsali rose gold oil or thrift
346 2018-01-23 23:13:45 City would be well below bristol city in the championship at this moment but for the oil money in 08. Just a rich wigan athletic!
347 2018-01-23 23:13:41 Loving Vincent is actually pretty cool, haven't seen it all but what I have seen is great, it's an animated film done entirely in oil paint mimicking the style of Van Gogh, but yeah Coco is gonna win this is basically just the Pixar award
348 2018-01-23 23:13:40 War is to the 21st century what oil was to the 20th; the pillar that supports the global economy.
349 2018-01-23 23:13:34 Vigorously massage with olive oil then toss with Parmesan, apple slices, lemon juice, salt & pepper. Add hazelnut, almond, or sunflower seeds (optional). Done.

352 2018-01-23 23:13:30 i recommend changing to the oil cleansing method! i used to have super oily skin and changing my wash method has balanced out my skin a lot! then i used blotting sheets during the day to get rid of extra shine
353 2018-01-23 23:13:17 Most people get dry skin and dehydrated skin mixed up. Oily skin is actually a sign that it's dehydrated. With dry skin products, you are basically putting more oil on your skin - check that your foundation is oil free. I hope that helps but I'm happy to answer anything. :)
354 2018-01-23 23:13:16 Data is the New oil!
Nada más cierto que eso!!!!
355 2018-01-23 23:13:11 Check your Engine oil this weekend.
356 2018-01-23 23:13:09 Happy Birthday! May GOD bless you with ALL of HIS GOODNESS! From my own personal experience 1tablespoon of cold pressed 100% organic flaxseed oil a day kills cancer FAST! TAKE IT! It WORKS!
357 2018-01-23 23:13:04 Just earlier, I applied oil onto my sword so it has great sharpness. If you touch it even slightly, your fingers would be cut and blood could spill.
358 2018-01-23 23:12:54 Lmfao glad you are aware of basic economics. Tell me what is the value of crude oil since it is listed as Man City’s “source of income” in their P&L statement lol
359 2018-01-23 23:12:45 I found my perfect hot oil treatment elixir and nobody has been able to tell me shit ever since
360 2018-01-23 23:12:35 #matd in 2015 BG group paid $32m for 78% of blocks IV and V, at that time there was little to no data for these blocks and the oil price was crashing. Today oil is $70, and the blocks now have data suggesting 3-10 billion recoverable,and 5-7 bill shale potential, BG are no mugs
361 2018-01-23 23:12:31 If I'm being honest, I assumed you still needed oil? Idk, not supposed to?
362 2018-01-23 23:11:57 IF the west were to separate it would be a country made up of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. What’s that? 4 million people maybe? No way BC would join. Hmmmm an oil rich country with a population of 4 million. That would be nice 
363 2018-01-23 23:11:50 Police are reporting multiple collisions on Hwy 402 near Oil Heritage Rd in #Wyoming. #slont
364 2018-01-23 23:10:59 Is there anything better than coconut oil?? Literally has so many good uses
365 2018-01-23 23:10:52 If you take vitamin c, zinc, essential peppermint oil and organic cold pressed kale juice, the chances of getting the flu are slim to none.
366 2018-01-23 23:10:51 @NicolleDWallace  What's going on with us as a Country? Are we becoming oblivious to what matters? Is this the new normal? Two kids died today, workers died in an oil rig explosion... is it true there was a Russian spy ship off the cost of North Carolina???

368 2018-01-23 23:10:17 The recent events where Quintis/Mt Romance were placed into voluntary receivership should not concern our customers  using WA Sandalwood oil [santalum spicatum]. Heritage Oils purchases WA Sandalwood oil from Dutjahn Sandalwood Oils, Kalgoorlie producing 3,000kgs oil this year.
369 2018-01-23 23:10:17 my roommates and I are testing different strains in our oil diffuser
370 2018-01-23 23:10:15 just took a shot of oregano oil 
371 2018-01-23 23:10:13 Loving La-Roche-Posay. Also bet Supergoop is great, too! Love their hand cream with SPF and oil sunscreen with SPF.
372 2018-01-23 23:10:07 Meanwhile First Nations are buying their shares back to invest futher in the oil sands.
373 2018-01-23 23:10:04 You've got a question?

Coconut oil is the answer. 
374 2018-01-23 23:10:00 Hi Jason. I am Victor. I emailed you last December. Thanks for connect us on Linkedin. Representative of a Oil Refinery in United States. We are looking for an Equity & Joint Venture partner.
375 2018-01-23 23:10:00 FEB   8    is going to be coming fast !!!! I will be on the beach in ,  are ya ready for it ,  Mexico !!!!!  believe it or not , it is safer , there is no oil in the water or on the beach !!  and there are fewer americans ( i need  a break )
376 2018-01-23 23:09:55 It has relevance as most commodities trade in dollars, oil etc...
377 2018-01-23 23:09:39 Add Roast Beetroot, Goat's Cheese, Roasted Pine Nuts or Walnuts, dress with olive oil & balsamic vinegar.
378 2018-01-23 23:09:30 Yes engine oil but very black oil
379 2018-01-23 23:09:23 Are you kidding??!! I want to add some solar panels to be free from dependence on oil.
380 2018-01-23 23:09:18 Why do our tax payers money goto pharmacy companies for research.They make billions..why do we give them our money..let them pay for their own research.This is a sign how stupid our government is..same thing .giving welfare checks to oil rich countries..
381 2018-01-23 23:09:15 @realDonaldTrump Solar employs more jobs than oil and coal combined. What you just did will cost thousands of jobs, not to mention taking this country backwards.
382 2018-01-23 23:09:12 You got to be 35 and have the permission of your husband. 
Progress  ?
Some 
The world is watching and their oil is diminishing
383 2018-01-23 23:08:50 You're diesel engine, I'm squirting mad oil
Down on the floor 'til my speaker starts to boil
I flip shit, quick slip, hip dip and I'm twisted
In your hands and your lips and your tongue tricks
And you're so thick and you're so thick and you're so
384 2018-01-23 23:08:45 I’d love to see caps on fees and wages but as you say Sky have been a key factor as well as the oil merchants.
385 2018-01-23 23:08:39 Will the new "gravel road" be wide enough for oil drilling equipment to be driven to that pristine and secluded location? Asking for all living things on our one and only earth.
386 2018-01-23 23:08:14 Agree! It’s about gas, oil, and NRA and Koch Bros. The rest of us are top soil!
387 2018-01-23 23:08:10 I've posted Uruguay twice and mentioned the only reason Venezuela is failing is capitalist intervention against their economy to steal oil...you're sticking with the fallacy that if no successful social states, then capitalism = superior. While capitalism destroys social states.
388 2018-01-23 23:08:08 wwwwww
389 2018-01-23 23:08:07 Giiiiiirl you ain’t lyin. The only way I’ve conquered it is w/ essential oils. I make an oil wash (like dissolves like!) and Shea butter (non-comedogenic) base cream. Loooooves.
390 2018-01-23 23:08:05 My mom bought my cat his own essential oil diffuser that diffuses cat nip because he’s been stressed being alone in the house all day...... it was $160......
391 2018-01-23 23:08:02 You say your legs hurt you need a massage, turn it over
I got some oil I could rub on your thighs, bust it open
I love the way that you hide, turn over hit from the side
Look me right up in my eyes
Tell me that pussy is mine

394 2018-01-23 23:08:01 remind me to never use carrot oil in my hair again.
395 2018-01-23 23:07:45 I do Kale and Potato soup with a little oil and garlic, and then at the very end, I'll poach an egg in the soup for each person.
396 2018-01-23 23:07:35 I also use morphine, percocet, lyrica, and 8 other meds. Along with medical marijuana including the high cbd oil. The marijuana helps out a lot.
397 2018-01-23 23:07:33  is it lube or oil?!
398 2018-01-23 23:07:30 Lol...  I don't blame you.  You know you can communicate this without an insult? So...There ain't grasses in oil palm farm? Mention the crops you are talking about.

402 2018-01-23 23:07:03 They’re going to have to use something a lot stronger than soft soap to wash those hands. Pruitt’s oil and gas buddies may have some suggestions.
403 2018-01-23 23:06:52 Was it the scene with the oil?

408 2018-01-23 23:06:22 In mud or oil would be a nice touch 
409 2018-01-23 23:06:20 Go to bed your talking shite they offered him no where near what you rags offered him. And by the way everyone wants our oil and just think when you fill your car up your giving money to city
410 2018-01-23 23:06:16 Thatcher dividend? You might have got one in Portsmouth but we certainly didn’t get anything up here. Took the oil and shut down manufacturing. Rebalancing everything for the benefit of the south east.
411 2018-01-23 23:06:08 Thank you! I put it on and I’ve got a timer on for 8 minutes. That’s definitely what got me with the Liquid Gold - my skin freaked and overcompensated for hours overnight. Gonna use a nice oil and a comforting moisturiser afterwards.
412 2018-01-23 23:06:03 What a snake oil salesman
413 2018-01-23 23:06:02 Nice try old Cali man - but you do know most of trumpsky’s products are made in China right ? Take a look at your MAGA baseball cap - China. Do you see him putting 30% on THAT! No. It’s all about protecting his oil deals - Russian Oil deals at that !
414 2018-01-23 23:05:43 I replaced an actuator, changed the oil, and replaced fuel filters on a Ram 3500 then I was able to put the transmission in the challenger. Will finish mounting transmission tomorrow morning.
415 2018-01-23 23:05:36 Maybe, just maybe because there is no room for oil blocks. Obasanjo has the land that I can call the size of the whole of  Abeokuta at ipaja ayobo. I’m especially disappointed in him for his atrocities. I can call Buhari a saint comparing to any politician in Nigeria today.
416 2018-01-23 23:05:33 James 5:14   Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.

421 2018-01-23 23:05:05 Trolls: that was 2013 and everything I wrote was true at the time. (I don't write the headlines). The government could have fixed the exchange rate system and avoided the inflation and currency depreciation that followed. But they didn't. And then oil prices collapsed in 2014.
422 2018-01-23 23:05:01 Because the oil and gas industries are heavily subsidized and this would raise costs of solar significantly higher. They can’t even import the materials. Solar should be an industry of the future for coal workers...
423 2018-01-23 23:05:01 I have received 30 phone calls regarding my bad experience when I got my oil changed last week and that’s actually more aggravating than the bad experience.
424 2018-01-23 23:04:51 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
425 2018-01-23 23:04:48 You need a wash and oil or cream, professional beard grower and can’t have any beard of significant length without both of the above.
426 2018-01-23 23:04:48 There’s absolutely no reason for offensive or brusque humour when a tweet of Martha Stewart’s that only reads “Oil” can get thousands of retweets.
427 2018-01-23 23:04:42 I've been at the dealership for 3 hours going on 4 
Just to get an oil change, tires rotated, and brake inspection 
428 2018-01-23 23:04:40 hhhhhhh what happened to that Russian oil money???
429 2018-01-23 23:04:40 oil changers: pop your hood please

430 2018-01-23 23:04:33 It sucks burning the midnight oil, but the end product is 
431 2018-01-23 23:04:28 Roasted with olive oil and pepper. They aren't that bad.

443 2018-01-23 23:02:58 .@CJTFOIR @CENTCOM:  Is he US ally? He's with Turk army so I think it makes him @NATO ally doesn't it? Listed Chechen terrorist. Didn't think we could top #Kirkuk where we facilitated #Quds Force #IRGC seizure of huge oil filed but we did it.  #MAGA #SDF @FoxNews @hogangidley45
444 2018-01-23 23:02:54 I can't tell if @realDonaldTrump really thinks putting a tariff on solar panels is going to bring jobs back to America or if this is just an attack on the solar industy to incentivize oil. Either way, this is backwards thinking.
445 2018-01-23 23:02:51 Oil change already?
446 2018-01-23 23:02:40 okay so kind of combination then? 

I think dry skin works well with night creams. oily skin (like mine) takes well to serums and oils. I use a hyaluronic acid serum and argan oil at night to balance the oils in my skin
447 2018-01-23 23:02:38 In fact, I would argue that bacon would soak up much less oil than bread, and as such this could be one of those counterintuitively healthier options. Like deep frying over shallow frying.
448 2018-01-23 23:02:35 All you need is some coconut oil in your life
449 2018-01-23 23:02:27 I know. But where I live we call it vape oil.
450 2018-01-23 23:02:22 OIL BRENT US$69.87/bbl +0.97%. Ultra- deepwater drilling begins in the Gulf Of Mexico. LLOG's Buckskin project set for a 2019 start.
451 2018-01-23 23:02:21 Note that the addition of the 2K acres for drilling in ANWR was due to the falling revenues Alaska has seen in the last several years from oil.  In order to provide UBI, you have to have actual revenue to distribute.
452 2018-01-23 23:02:08 None of that relates to the fact that cocaine, heroin, Fentanyl, etc, also come over that border.  Mexico's government was corrupt before cartels.  Mexico is an oil rich country, 3rd largest supplier to the US - the government keeps the money, doesn't spend it on the people.
453 2018-01-23 23:01:56 Man, these honkies are a trip! The oil and coal industry must have worked hard on the list of 247 sicknesses associated with wind farms. Among the list – herpes, chest pain, anxiety, mutated chickens, and dogs staring at walls.
454 2018-01-23 23:01:52 Aaa my oil is leaking and I need an oil change so I can't drive my car until I get it fixed
455 2018-01-23 23:01:48 So, why all the coal and oil subsidies? A little hypocrisy? This Is just tilting the playing field, and is NOT fair trade at all.
456 2018-01-23 23:01:31 Helping Big Oil every way he can, $3 trillion per year just isn't enough for the crooks at the top.
457 2018-01-23 23:01:16 Anyone good oil tycoon investors!
Please give me money!
458 2018-01-23 23:01:04 Gotta grab stuff from walmart for my car's oil change, then home depot to make some keys and to check Gamestop for my MHW preorder.

Busy evening so I hope y'all had a Merry Tuesday!
Should be live later tonight.
459 2018-01-23 23:01:03 does arslan use palm oil?

462 2018-01-23 23:00:37 Aye real shit that Argan Oil be getting y’all right huh? I be fuckin with that shit from time to time. It don’t stank either so I fuck with it fr.
463 2018-01-23 23:00:35 Didn’t he also cut tax subsidies for solar installations while adding gas and oil subsidies? Starting to see a pattern here.
464 2018-01-23 23:00:28 Only country in the world to discover oil and get poorer.
465 2018-01-23 23:00:23 Are you looking for relief from pain..try our CBD oil and for a limited time..receive a free sleep spray..
466 2018-01-23 23:00:21 And how would all the oil drillling that trump just approved affect Alaska and California which are already vulnerable to these natural disasters?

469 2018-01-23 23:00:08 Love bulletproof coffee - although I more often than not just use MCT oil. Still as good!
470 2018-01-23 23:00:06 Shift motor oil 
471 2018-01-23 22:59:59 We're like oil and water, we just dont mix.
472 2018-01-23 22:59:52 If only we’d kept the oil. Genius.
473 2018-01-23 22:59:50 I haven’t done butter because I’m dairy intolerant but I know people that do and love it. I do MCT oil
474 2018-01-23 22:59:48 It’s one of the best comebacks that one. On par with found oil, got poorer.
475 2018-01-23 22:59:44 As long as special interests remain embedded in the system, it will be a long transition till the market will be renewable. In the beginning most cars were electric - oil corporations won. Saturn introduced the EV1 during the '90s - the oil companies won.
476 2018-01-23 22:59:43 @BraunStrowman what kind of beard oil do you use
477 2018-01-23 22:59:30 Coconut Oil 
Eat A Teaspoon A Day
478 2018-01-23 22:59:30 Buy oil and gas stocks?? Thinking about BP?
479 2018-01-23 22:59:29 Big oil
480 2018-01-23 22:59:03 As well as poverty for their defeated native populations. If you're looking to use Venezuela as an example of socialism failing, you are 100% unaware of how the US (capitalism) is destabilizing the country to steal all that shale oil.
481 2018-01-23 22:58:48 lol I spilled tea tree oil all up on my carpet last night & the smell is still lingering around in my room
482 2018-01-23 22:58:30 Not to mention doing serious harm to solar industry. We are way behind rest of world, but then many of our officials are beholding to oil industry.
483 2018-01-23 22:58:14 Chelsea want to be self sufficient though. They don’t want to have to rely on Roman all the time. The only way we will be able to compete is if he was to sell to an oil rich country like City/PSG.
484 2018-01-23 22:58:12 which one be ‘Oil dey your head again hain!! ??’
485 2018-01-23 22:58:07 On the bright side, when all the other countries are using renewable energy, there will be all that coal and oil left for us to power our 20th Century economy.
486 2018-01-23 22:57:52 Somebody come oil my scalp

493 2018-01-23 22:57:22 I was playing civ6 and after friendly trade relations and America requesting a declaration of friendship which I accepted, they declared a joint war on me with Spain after discovering I had uranium and oil. Man this shit is accurate
494 2018-01-23 22:57:15 Yes, ands THAT’S the reason we’re about to spend billions to topple his regime and take over all the countries oil and resources. Cuz We CARE

498 2018-01-23 22:56:32 Sure are. If you have your way, pretty soon you'll bring back the whale oil industry. I mean who doesn't want to support the whale oil industry
499 2018-01-23 22:56:24 one source says that Trump's tariff announcement today, will cost the solar industry 23,000 jobs, how much did the oil companies pay for that one?
500 2018-01-23 22:56:22 Maybe a better sorce for energy than coal and oil??? Just sayin
501 2018-01-23 22:56:21 Isn't being covered in oil synonymous with owning old land rovers ?
502 2018-01-23 22:56:13 oil kills... it kills our environment and our workers... 
503 2018-01-23 22:56:10 Seaweed many years ago had changes in DNA due to bacteria. That seaweed detects oil. I guess that's worth a lot.
504 2018-01-23 22:56:07 Or the deaths from the oil rig explosion in OK.
505 2018-01-23 22:56:06 Will you be running full time with any series like the all stars or WoO? Glad your back in a sprint car. Good luck this year!

510 2018-01-23 22:55:23 I argue that we hire the best nurses to be nurses, the best oil workers to do that work, etc. if everyone that wants to put out fires happen to be male, I don’t see a problem. So “gender equality” may not mean something deaireable for every situation. I prefer women to give birth
511 2018-01-23 22:55:16 oil is "rigged"...
512 2018-01-23 22:55:05 Nah, I like my roast beef with oil and vinegar, heavier on the vinegar. :)
513 2018-01-23 22:54:43 Sorry Angie, but you have to be highly intelligent to be a Snake Oil Salesman. Everybody knows that Fake President Donald Trump is extremely stupid, way too stupid to be a Snake Oil Salesman

518 2018-01-23 22:53:58 Thank you for taking the broader wall off the table. Tell the Pro-death Party to go F___k themselves. Senator Schumer, include the immigrants but ask for no oil drilling off any coast, better healthcare,etc. something that all Americans want.
519 2018-01-23 22:53:41 This is not abt jobs. It’s abt boosting oil and gas and coal.
520 2018-01-23 22:53:35 Who's got some green oil. 
521 2018-01-23 22:53:32 Well, now President Shithole can line his pockets with graft from the oil and gas industry. No other reason for this.

525 2018-01-23 22:53:20 Big oil and the coal industry (Koch brothers) want alternative energy to die.
526 2018-01-23 22:53:12 If EIA number are same as API +4 +4 I can't see how this fake bull market can continue  With API number we are now up 27M combine since Nov. 40M more crude than in Jan 2015, production back to record high OPEC still hold back 2MB/d and 40 new #EV model for 2018 $OIL #WTI
527 2018-01-23 22:53:07 Pryor to Pearl we participated in the lend lease act, oil embargoes and other sanctions against Germany and Japan. The Swiss, not so much.
528 2018-01-23 22:53:00 You can thinly slice it and fry it in a skillet, add barely any oil
529 2018-01-23 22:52:58 Oil is not used to generate electricity. Your high dollar celebrity supporters need oil to run their private jets.
530 2018-01-23 22:52:56 With warm oil would be nice. Lol
531 2018-01-23 22:52:51 me too but I bout to take the initiative and start walking around with body oil, I'm committed to the career
532 2018-01-23 22:52:41 I threw a tantrum at Paul's because I didn't smell enough truffle oil in my truffle fries..
533 2018-01-23 22:52:39 paid $86 for an oil change at @Valvoline ... I’m triggered and feel ripped off
534 2018-01-23 22:52:39 This is the beginning of the end-our planet is now under control of oil and gas magnates that don't care about your drinking water-your air-global warming-now that the US has deregulated-other countries can't compete unless they do the same. Congratulations. 2000 people>planet.

536 2018-01-23 22:52:34 Thanks for covering.

Very disappointing that NEB appears incapable of anything other than "moar oil is national interest." Would be nice if this hearing turned out to have any nuance.
537 2018-01-23 22:52:31 I get so annoyed hearing some of the stuff my nutrition professor says lol what good is a PhD in nutrition if you think salmon and olive oil are healthy!!
538 2018-01-23 22:51:57 We overthrew Gaddafi because he was about to abandon the U.S. dollar for Gold in oil trading which would have caused the U.S. dollar to collapse.  Now we're pushing this false Russia narrative as they're doing a deal with China to switch away from U.S. dollars.  See a pattern?

544 2018-01-23 22:51:22 It's actually kind of funny that my whole adult life, every single leftist I've ever met has denounced oil company executives in the most strident ways possible. Now under the "outsider" Trump we have an evil AND stupid oil company man in charge of Foggy Bottom. #Ironic

547 2018-01-23 22:51:05 I discovered this on my own. I can't take evening primrose oil because it clashes with my meds and makes me unwell. I also can't have grapefruit juice.
548 2018-01-23 22:50:59 I acknowledge that spirit is key my friend. I'm at the point now where I no longer need any substance to help me along my journey. But I say get you some oil and shrooms because they're great tools to expand your consciousness and work through what's holding you back. 
549 2018-01-23 22:50:57 Just copped that tea tree oil
550 2018-01-23 22:50:56 What's next is @Walmart going to stop selling gasoline, bleach, Drano, motor oil, antifreeze and any of a 100 other chemicals that stupid people can hurt themselves with.
551 2018-01-23 22:50:47 Prima facie, Trump supporters are weak minded so I agree with that comment.  However, I do not think them ridiculous, just deceived. After 2 decades of FOX brainwashing, they were easily indoctrinated by Snake Oil Salesman Trump. For our countries sake, I hope they come around
552 2018-01-23 22:50:43 SMcore is having a doctor step in who looks and sounds exactly like Seth Green tell me to go Gluten Free and reccomended I use lavender for anxiety when I already keep lavender oil with me all the time for that reason

554 2018-01-23 22:50:25 Of course not, they are using the Kurdish people for the interests of Israel and to stop oil/gas pipelines from Iran.
555 2018-01-23 22:50:25 Use beard oil while your growing it, you wont itch
556 2018-01-23 22:50:15 Ok. Do you leave the oil mix in over night then shampoo next day?
557 2018-01-23 22:50:15 too much oil money  
558 2018-01-23 22:50:08 Or loose their medical from country of origin.  My NORWIEGANS mother in law made a profit each time she was hospitalized.  She stayed in a free luxurious room in her sister's nursing home for a month could do this once a year. Oil $ in Norway goes to the state (people).
559 2018-01-23 22:50:04 Try cleansing oil!!! I like the face shop one
560 2018-01-23 22:49:58 In bed, watching catfish, burning lavender oil with my lights dimmed to the perfect ambiance, clinging to life while I try not to aggressively vomit into the trash. That would ruin the ambiance.

576 2018-01-23 22:47:15 i am here, and am ready to be let down!
577 2018-01-23 22:47:14 Coconut oil is a lie
578 2018-01-23 22:46:35 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...

580 2018-01-23 22:46:21 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
581 2018-01-23 22:46:19 what the hell is olive oil gelato
582 2018-01-23 22:46:19 I’ve always been fascinated by oil rigs. Seeing the coked ones in the early morning always made me feel something. I would love to shoot a film about a young man living that life
583 2018-01-23 22:46:11 $PTEN will its oil/gas explosion effect its stock? @jimcramer #MadTweets
584 2018-01-23 22:46:04 I fucked up the drain bolt to my oil pan and now here I am
585 2018-01-23 22:45:59 Reads... It happened again in 1986, when Saudi Arabia-led OPEC allowed prices to drop precipitously, and then in 1990, when the Saudis sent prices plummeting as a way of taking out Russia, which was seen as a threat to their oil supremacy. In 1998, they succeeded.
586 2018-01-23 22:45:54 That does help but I put olive oil and vinegar on my bread. So the chips are still doomed. 
587 2018-01-23 22:45:38 One is owned by an oil state and the other is the richest self-reliant club  in the world. What chance has Austerity Chelsea got?
588 2018-01-23 22:45:36 i got so excited bc i remembered i don’t have any classes tomorrow so i get to sleep in HOWEVER i forgot i have to get my car’s oil changed at 9-fucking-o’clock in the morning
589 2018-01-23 22:45:34 I think every major nation is preparing for the next big war. Pleple don't see it yet or too naive to ignore it - with all nations racing to drop their currencies to zero in exchange for guns and oil. but the big boys know it so they came up w/ cryptos to protect themselves.
590 2018-01-23 22:45:25 Trump has virtually killed the solar industry. Solar employs more people than coal/oil combined & will cause the loss of approx 23,000 jobs
591 2018-01-23 22:45:21 Lol dawg.. Coconut oil or aloe?
592 2018-01-23 22:45:13 Sounds like you are for oil drilling in the US ocean to help us get off of foreign oil?
593 2018-01-23 22:44:41 Oil not the point 
He’s got a job he didn’t apply for
With no experience in the women’s game
He’s deleted tweets 
Come on there were better candidates with better experience that the FA passed over 
Go read @JacquiOatley timeline please
594 2018-01-23 22:44:39 Skincare Twitter - I’m thinking of using The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution tonight. Am I risking a sore face for work tomorrow? Should I put on an oil afterwards? (For reference, I’m slightly sensitive and Alpha H Liquid Gold turned my face into an oil slick.)
595 2018-01-23 22:44:38 Oil rig gas explosion.
I'm so sorry. Really am.

This does not happen with renewables.
596 2018-01-23 22:44:32 It has been prophesied that new oil will be found in Israel  & USA  & that they will be the greatest energy supplier to the rest of the . So far everything this man has said has come true. Do not know if you believe in such things but his past accuracy has been uncanny
597 2018-01-23 22:44:27 So since daddy got my room smelling like straight gassss, I am burning candles and oil, I done sprayed this shit out and left my door open so it can air out  hopefully the smell will be gone by the time people get back 
598 2018-01-23 22:44:23 The Military Industrial Complex/Big Oil of both USA & Russia wins anyways in this clusterfuck of a situation they get to sell weapons to everyone and the oil price increases due to uncertainity.
599 2018-01-23 22:44:22 slice them in half, crush a few whole garlic cloves, add olive oil + salt + pepper,  and roast them at 400º
600 2018-01-23 22:44:15 I was sleeping on peanut oil, that shit taste wayyyy better then Vegetable oil, it’s just expensive af ! The great Value brand was $10 & some change 
601 2018-01-23 22:44:14 Glad to have you back!
602 2018-01-23 22:44:05 What kind of rig? For some reason the word Oil doesnt appear on the article.
603 2018-01-23 22:43:55 I have a babe that reminds me to take a shoot of anointing oil before i sleep, she still tells me when her Booba is reacting to cold, she keeps me company working at night, she still ask if i read today,she laughs at my grammatical blunders.
604 2018-01-23 22:43:52 Oh cool! I didn't know that about the essential oil. Thanks for sharing! 
605 2018-01-23 22:43:51 Niggas cheating with that beard oil smh
606 2018-01-23 22:43:49 into recipes that call for both butter and olive oil
607 2018-01-23 22:43:45 So apparently I’m allergic to tea tree oil and what are the fucking odds that ONLY 5% of the people in the U.S are allergic to it :) a fucking natural oil, and I’m allergic to it:)
608 2018-01-23 22:43:42 Being self sufficient in energy means not only having our own oil and gas but manufacturing solar panels and windmills.
609 2018-01-23 22:43:33 Earlier I fried some chicken in some peanut Oil & made homemade shrimp fried rice  NIGGA when I say that shit tasted like chineseeeee I mean just that

612 2018-01-23 22:43:14 There's a company here in my state that sell nothing but different types of cooking/dipping oil.  Tomato and basil is good, and creamy garlic
613 2018-01-23 22:43:13 They're actually not that bad when roasted/slightly blackened with some olive oil and garam masala. Congrats to you both, this has made me smile all morning!

617 2018-01-23 22:43:02 OPEC bullshit narrative used to be oil market share; then it moved on to oil inventory.  OPEC feeds bullshit news/comment cycle for financial oil players for whom market price stability is Death. Insights like yours are only heard when they fit the narrative #OOTT
618 2018-01-23 22:42:52 Oil change and car wash tomorrow for sure
619 2018-01-23 22:42:50 The price of shaving is outrageous! 50¢! I am not some wealthy oil investor!
620 2018-01-23 22:42:48 Yeah under western embargo’s of economy dependent on oil prices which USA controls with Saudis & Middle East
621 2018-01-23 22:42:37 Try coconut oil that’s suppose to be really good for your lashes !
622 2018-01-23 22:42:36 Linseed oil is a smeary absorbing mess so I use that and galkyd fod glazing and top layers
623 2018-01-23 22:42:34 Nicholson said oil king pricing fwiw
624 2018-01-23 22:42:29 For sale: one essential durian oil, never used.
625 2018-01-23 22:42:29 My physics teacher is showing us a video on how to heat oil
626 2018-01-23 22:42:27 Yea because Chavez the socialist who implemented a ton of socialist laws and start a revolution for socialism totally didn't exist and have ramifications on the country like enabling horrid oil spending and sending the economy down the toilet.
627 2018-01-23 22:42:21 Good luck and be safe
628 2018-01-23 22:42:18 @realDonaldTrump
@HouseGOP @GOPLeader 
Illegal Aliens and immigrants sent $26,000,000,000 in remittances to Mex. Remittances surpassed Oil revenues making it the largest source of annual Revenue to Mex.
I propose you levy a modest 7% tax on remittances to build wall.
$1.82B yr.
629 2018-01-23 22:42:02 Lol yup. Well we'll have power in the morning. Just that I saw an ad on Facebook, this new mobile salon is running a promo till Saturday so gotta use the time in the morning to unbraid then do a hot oil treatment with the power instead
630 2018-01-23 22:42:01 Nothing to see here,oh look over there, it's another mass shooting or Volcano or train Wreck or Airplane missing or Hurricane or oil spill or traffic jam or building fire or Flood or Mudslide or you get the picture.
631 2018-01-23 22:41:59 Apparently Abramovich oil money ran out 
632 2018-01-23 22:41:44 I was saying I cant wait until the summer to come out here w a blanket & tanning oil n lay next to him ugh smh they all looked at me like bitchhhhh smfh
633 2018-01-23 22:41:41 When did i say put undiluted tea tree oil on your face? Never said to put pure lemon juice either it should always be mixed in a small quantity but ok lol
634 2018-01-23 22:41:41 Just admit it, your a shit club fuelled by oil!!
635 2018-01-23 22:41:40 Thursday price changes: Heating/stove oils to drop by 8/10ths of a cent a litre.
Diesel to drop by 1.1 cents a litre. Gasoline to increase by 1.6 cents a litre. Oil higher, Canadian dollar steady...
636 2018-01-23 22:41:35 @Castrol Oil' s hiring of @wilfork75 for their commercials makes ZERO sense...and yet it's resulted in pure genius.
637 2018-01-23 22:41:34 i have coconut oil IN MY EYES
638 2018-01-23 22:41:34 ugh.....between you and @kayyybearxo's oil set my wallet's gonna cry this month xD
639 2018-01-23 22:41:24 Oil company pays for the gas in the rig rate. So it’s sunken to a driller. Some rigs in New Mexico pull directly from wells though. And offshore rigs pull directly from wells. But offshore is a certification nightmare. /1
640 2018-01-23 22:41:23 It's like...fuck Shea moisture still for that ad but that red palm oil collection is fye
641 2018-01-23 22:41:12 You know how us black fok turn the radio down to see the street signs, right...

Well...I just turned the radio down to see if I smelled oil coming from car #itworkedtho
642 2018-01-23 22:41:10 @realDonaldTrump  The truth is he did it to help the oil and coal industries
643 2018-01-23 22:40:28 I have no idea what inflation has to do with any of this. 

Venezuela is in trouble because it built its economy on oil and the price collapsed. It also suffers from a corrupt authoritarian government like the US.
644 2018-01-23 22:40:24 バルカロールの平和は俺が守る！　なんてな♪
645 2018-01-23 22:40:20 We will surpass Saudi Arabia as an oil producer this year. Solar is not viable now and driving up the price of solar most certainly will not help.Converting automobile engines to run on natural gas is viable now.
646 2018-01-23 22:40:15 You of course never fill a car with their Petrol, or use public transport using petrol or diesel, use natural gas for cooking or central heating or electricity generated by natural gas. Shall I go on? Plastics, medicines etc using Saudi oil...
647 2018-01-23 22:40:12 lmfaoooo bria said tag two people who should oil her up next time for the photoshoot. What did I do? 

Tag myself twice
648 2018-01-23 22:40:09 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
649 2018-01-23 22:40:03 He has setback Solar power jobs by slapping a tariff on imports his theory makes jobs lost while he gets oil $$!

651 2018-01-23 22:39:34 There was a chap who once tried to say $CAD determines crude oil price - story #1 of 100 :-D
652 2018-01-23 22:39:21 Has the oil ran out?
653 2018-01-23 22:39:20 It's a diesel, and dirties its own oil on a depressingly regular basis. 

To be fair, I'd have chucked the same sort of stuff into the GLX when I serviced it back in the day to help keep the DOHC's tappets and injectors relatively free of gunge.
654 2018-01-23 22:39:09 You’ve got to do a hot oil job on yourself? That got your attention didn’t it? - @RealMichaelKay
655 2018-01-23 22:38:56 @LOrealParisUK @bootsuk has boots stopped stocking extraordinary oil moisturiser. I love it but can’t find it London city stores.
656 2018-01-23 22:38:42 I'm actually here for coconut oil slander (for hair and skin).
657 2018-01-23 22:38:23 I think my hippy ass cousin puts coconut oil in all our meals, because my nails are growing stupid fast.
658 2018-01-23 22:38:13 i’m gonna lose my gd mind if my bil doesn’t finish changing the oil in my car so i can fucking go home
659 2018-01-23 22:37:47 Are we all in agreement that it's bad when liberals try raising the "gas tax" or put taxes on oil to fight so called "climate change"? i.e. it just raises prices for consumers and hurts the poor.
660 2018-01-23 22:37:46 pake haple yang grapeseed oil. sejak rutin pake itu, gue udah berhenti jadi pengedar jirigen minyak di wajah
661 2018-01-23 22:37:27 It came from an Oil fan fwiw
662 2018-01-23 22:37:27 Just washed my face with coconut oil for the first time in forever and it feels so good 
663 2018-01-23 22:37:22 Oh! Where’s the remainder of the video 
664 2018-01-23 22:36:50 Its a kind traditional food for the ewes, its called djenkple becos  we use palm oil in preparing it
665 2018-01-23 22:36:47 Bring back 2000 jobs to America and kill off 200,000 jobs already here. Good deal making. You know he has interests in the oil industry.
666 2018-01-23 22:36:46 Hey Adam Schiff.  Have you thought it might be best to be perfectly honest rather than the snake oil salesman you have shamefully become?
667 2018-01-23 22:36:30 I've gotten into the habit of eating flax seed everyday - no need to supplement with fish oil or anything!
668 2018-01-23 22:36:26 I wanna oil it up and fuck it
669 2018-01-23 22:36:20 I will look down on you like non essential oil plebe that you are.
670 2018-01-23 22:36:03 Now why do you suppose he'd do that? His taxes show he doesn't have anything invested there,but does in oil?? Hmm
671 2018-01-23 22:36:03 I found an oil fragrance I'd lost for who knows how long called Simply Pink and it smells so good... but I don't know where I bought it to get it again 
672 2018-01-23 22:35:57 Rate that mate. Fuck city, oil club
673 2018-01-23 22:35:40 I’m getting it checked out tomorrow it may just need oil I pray
674 2018-01-23 22:35:31 Thank you! Oil & Gas companies made US the biggest producer of oil because of fracking technology that destroys our lands. Don’t give them our pristine coastline.

676 2018-01-23 22:35:07 Maybe oil and gas materials from other countries aren’t being sold below cost
677 2018-01-23 22:34:56 Agree. But what happened to Libya & Iraq after? Same Western clique undid all those revolutionaries as soon as it acted against the Anglo-Saxon elite's interest. back 2 Square 1?  Its as simple as that. Gulf now same as in 1920. Its OIL.
678 2018-01-23 22:34:51 Islam is oil & the West is water. Maybe @MaajidNawaz can be 'The Emulsifier'. He will force the mix, whether it wants to or not. @ShaziaHobbs
679 2018-01-23 22:34:40 This one is on oil companies
680 2018-01-23 22:34:38 Well, we massively subsidize oil companies, now, and we know coal isn't going to make a comeback.
681 2018-01-23 22:34:38 Lol dowsed in tanning oil then lit aflame.
682 2018-01-23 22:34:30 and now the oil is running low
683 2018-01-23 22:34:23 You and David fly spewing carbon. It is killing the planet. GreenNH3 scientists patented worlds only (lower cost than oil) zero carbon jet and vehicle fuel. Why will nobody lift a finger to help move it to the next stage? Please do what you can. Honest scientists deserve better.
684 2018-01-23 22:34:22 Bruh this jawn was pouring oil on her tits and I could see the hairs on her chest LMFAO WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS

689 2018-01-23 22:33:56 That we should use avocado oil or something with aloe Vera.  Ayam just tayad
690 2018-01-23 22:33:51 These guys at Sears fuckin suck. Who the hell does an oil change for an hour I'm confused
691 2018-01-23 22:33:46 a democrat, it’s not about whether you are for oil or against it. It’s about a group of guys that hugged and kissed their wife, kids, mom, dad, brother or sister good bye, said see ya later, fully intending on coming home when their hitch was over. Nobody was expecting this horr
692 2018-01-23 22:33:44 Suits us. No oil, no water, no electricity, no whisky or salmon propping up your horrendous balance of payments. No Scots fighting in your illegal wars. No trident. Do you want me to go on ?
693 2018-01-23 22:33:32 My prayers go out to the families but how did this oil rig explode like it did what went wrong I hope we can find out not again
694 2018-01-23 22:33:30 OIL DIFF: 5.35 -> 5.44
695 2018-01-23 22:32:56 I guess if you’re gonna be trash, oil field trash is the best trash to be.
696 2018-01-23 22:32:52 Let me get this clear you are not VEGAN on the days You use your phone, use a car or bus, eat products containing vegetable oil because they all can contain animal parts.            And it’s ok to be a part time VEGAN under the definition and constitution of the VEGAN religion.
697 2018-01-23 22:32:52 No. In bid to run up oil and gas profits, Trump imposed tariffs on solar panels. I bet dollars to donuts he hadn’t a clue washing machines would be affected along with thousands of other stuff we import from China.
698 2018-01-23 22:32:35 switched back to acrylic on canvas and I feel so much more comfortable  learned so much from trying oil though! Venture out and soak in as much info as possible!
699 2018-01-23 22:32:25 I love their oil free face lotion!! I’m gonna check it out. Thanks friend 
700 2018-01-23 22:32:15 oh yeah and don't be afraid to use more oil than you usually would to give it a nice moist texture and not a nasty dry one
701 2018-01-23 22:32:13 Like 2nd graders. Raise your hand Mark. It'll be your turn soon. And Lamar, no more throwing the stick. Now y'all take your CBD oil & take a nap..
702 2018-01-23 22:32:08 Trump said he was going to create jobs not did Troy jobs we want to do away with oil disgusting
703 2018-01-23 22:32:05 I’m a have ya body sweating like you dipped in baby oil
704 2018-01-23 22:32:03 I like using the #UniquelyJ avocado oil on my toast

706 2018-01-23 22:31:15 The body shop one! It has tea tree oil, I really like it :)
707 2018-01-23 22:31:10 Oil companies don't help our societies, they destroy our societies for profit, polluting our rivers, poisoning our air, and killing innocent wildlife. This explosion could have been avoided if it were instead a renewable energy resource.
708 2018-01-23 22:30:54 I have been to old Trafford  You can’t even come back with a valid point  Bet you love oil and Arabs though 
709 2018-01-23 22:30:38 No, he's not in bed with big oil at all.

716 2018-01-23 22:29:48 This is the same promise he made to Senator Collins. Wonder how much she trusts him now. If I shook his hand, would definitely count all fingers to make sure I still had them. In the old days he would be a snake oil salesman. Maybe he still is. Quite oily and untrustworthy.
717 2018-01-23 22:29:47 @elonmusk help me leave my oil patch job please
718 2018-01-23 22:29:27 The oil/fossil fuel companies should stop selling to California and wish them good luck.
719 2018-01-23 22:29:15 Who created IS, who created or supported the "moderated rebels", white helmets, and who were those that wanted Assad out? And for what? An oil pipeline, huh?
We, the western democratic countries are culprit on each casualty. Think about.
720 2018-01-23 22:29:13 More workers in #solarindustry than in coal (66K) AND oil/gas (177.5K) combined. 30% tariff on solar basically axes the industry that employs 260K. GOP killing jobs, not creating, and snuffing safety nets at same time. #asininepolicy

725 2018-01-23 22:28:40 There’s nothing ironic about the mix of socialism and oil. In fact, socialism has often been popular in resource-rich countries because the populations of such places like the idea of nationalizing (and profiting from) their resource wealth.
726 2018-01-23 22:28:22 the oil kings don’t know how to win but I still love them with my whole heart (and you should too tbh)
727 2018-01-23 22:28:10 As a solar company, we are devastated to learn Trump has imposed a 30% tariff on solar panels virtually killing the solar industry. Solar employs more people than coal and oil combined. today's decision will cause the loss of roughly 23,000 American jobs this year. by #GJGunit
728 2018-01-23 22:28:04 The plotted a 26,000 year cycle? Moved 1000 tonne blocks up mountains and built huge megaliths that perfectly align with the stars, we sacrifice entire countries for oil & still have different gods

733 2018-01-23 22:27:17 Jane Fonda is a tool. She proved she’s all show when she came to my home town of Fort mcmurray to protest the oil sands and wouldn’t take even a moment to stop and listen to the people of the community about real facts. It was all just a photo op. Same as today.
734 2018-01-23 22:27:07 This is RUBBISH.. how does a country that produces oil, hav shortages of oil????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
735 2018-01-23 22:27:00 If you taking it for the Omega 3 try cold pressed linseed oil...tastes nice and nutty!
736 2018-01-23 22:27:00 WTI/RBOB Slide After Surprise Crude Inventory Build ?

Didn't seem like a surprise to the oil stocks, they were weak all day in the face of crude up 2%...

Apparently someone knew...

745 2018-01-23 22:25:58 I’m not putting much trust or faith in coal/steal/oil voters until November 8, 2020.
746 2018-01-23 22:25:57 Don't forget the offshore asset, south Ramadan very close to two fields, both 5/6km away from us and producing oil, 550-MMbbl Ramadan oil field 5 km (3 mi) to the northwest, and the 1.5-Bbbl Morgan field 6 km (4 mi) to the southeast. This is forgotten....

749 2018-01-23 22:24:29 Faking politicians said stop spewing carbon to save the planet. Honest GreenNH3 scientists sacrificed and patented the worlds only (lower cost than oil) zero carbon fuel for jets +all. You and Mr Attenborough know about it but keep flying dirty. This is news. Please report news
750 2018-01-23 22:24:26 3 weeks ago, I’ve had all of my oil drain out of my car from the oil cap not being put back in all the way at the auto shop, last week, I had a hit and run while I was parked at a gas station, & today I was hit by another car when I had the right of way turning on 90... lol great

760 2018-01-23 22:23:17 Came in to get an oil change and now I’m out 400 bucks 
761 2018-01-23 22:22:58 The technology exists to turn all of that rubbish into pure fuel oil. (Kerosene, not gasoline.) Why aren't we using it??
762 2018-01-23 22:22:57 Worldwide condensate production has increased, because gas is now produced in bigger volumes. The commercial  oil we find in the fractured shales is very light crude (liquid at reservoir conditions), or condensate (some of which is very light because it has too much C3 and C4)
763 2018-01-23 22:22:51 if i see one more person say coconut oil is good for ur face i’m putting myself in the oven. we GET IT , you’re privileged enough to not get clogged pores . just go

765 2018-01-23 22:22:41 I only wish and pray they could do such a documentary on apartheid Israel, just so they could show the world he truth and how bad human rights are in occupied Palestine, trumps best friends Israeli Zionists control the media that’s the problem, weras Saudis only control the oil
766 2018-01-23 22:22:37 Time to take the car in for oil change and maintenance stuff.
767 2018-01-23 22:22:33 Coconut oil is overrated
768 2018-01-23 22:22:18 Most of the so called tests of windpower dangers come from Russia which is a major oil producer. Putin billions come from oil so do you think they may have made up all this bs ?

776 2018-01-23 22:21:07 PresDT-Once again, understand the Kurds are going to turn into Syrian Citizens who can vote & make the gas/oil line a Reality without War, That being said, end of message...Double cross me, & I will Triple Cross you...Sir
777 2018-01-23 22:21:05 This is not motivated by the desire to uphold international law or to stop the world from descending into violent chaos, but rather it’s another false narrative designed to support regime change & pursuit of a coveted oil pipeline through Syria.
778 2018-01-23 22:20:55 please compare RBS's and OIL's chat together to get fun
779 2018-01-23 22:20:46 Funny or Die announced layoffs because of a “digital sector crunch” aka because they “irresponsibly and greedily produced an ad campaign for Shell oil which they had to pull and refund when their publicly progressive founder was correctly pissed”
780 2018-01-23 22:20:45 I'm not sure how you're informed about USA's world standing but a multitude of sources, left and right, paint a different picture. Trump is viewed as an ignorant, snake oil salesman, devoid of empathy, unchristian and a bit dim.
781 2018-01-23 22:20:35 @juliemason tariffs on “solar products” has nothing to do with consumer products or American jobs, but helps slow the progress in solar energy, that other thoughtful countries have taken the lead in and helps oil industry execs continue the false narrative of solar inefficiency.
782 2018-01-23 22:20:32 Bruh you gotta make them right. It's gotta marinate in salt and spices. Put in some olive oil. Or you could douse it in cheese. Or both.
783 2018-01-23 22:20:14 Rancid oil of any kind is gross!
784 2018-01-23 22:20:07 I wish I was the person designated to rub oil on Bria Myles’s booty

786 2018-01-23 22:19:58 Had my new car for 11 days and now it currently has 2 oil leaks. Typical.

789 2018-01-23 22:19:40 Highest tax increase in Albertans history, out of control spending out of control debt, tax and killing oil, attacking our beef and a provincial sales tax coming how can you not vote for them again, can’t wait until they are unemployed!
790 2018-01-23 22:19:34 anyway since I'm out I may as well go get my oil changed bc electra is way overdue for that
791 2018-01-23 22:19:31 The dairy sector provides a solid return on investment for companies. There has been a 10% ROIC (return on invested capital) for dairy proteins as compared to grain or oil seeds at 3% to 5% from 2010-2016 (based on publicly traded companies), Vivek Pai @RaboFoodAgri #DairyForum
792 2018-01-23 22:19:21 Hearing about the oil rig explosion breaks my heart and it’s so fucking scary being from an oil rig family because that job is no fucking joke and anything can happen.
793 2018-01-23 22:19:19 Come to bed to find The Toddler has emptied a box of tissues and a bottle of Olbas oil all over her bed. Unsurprisingly (because her room STINKS) she’s not asleep. She‘s going to be HORRIBLE tomorrow. Didn’t yell. Just said ‘I’m really sad you did this, I love you, good night.’

796 2018-01-23 22:19:01 I got my car into the best mechanic in town (the one who fixed my catalytic converter for $600!!!) somehow AND he remembered me so fingers crossed he’ll cut me a deal again AND that it’s just a quick oil pan fix with no engine damage 
797 2018-01-23 22:18:48 On the train, I saw a black man with more hair than me...

800 2018-01-23 22:18:08 El FA pregonaba el “gas oil productivo” para el agro y terminaron haciendo que el agro ponga $ del gas oil para el shopping del hermano masón asesor. La FocA aplaude. #Guampudxs

802 2018-01-23 22:18:05 While the search for eco-friendly alternatives to palm oil which would be feasible on  global scale continues, Orangutan Land Trust chooses to do its part to make sure palm oil is produced responsibly through our participation in RSPO, POIG and PONGO Alliance.
803 2018-01-23 22:18:04 How? Every employee i have ever worked for has offered 401k. From grocery store when I was in high school to part stores in college and the oil field testing department i work in now. I'm pretty sure companies have a legal obligation.
804 2018-01-23 22:18:03 There is an oil for that

808 2018-01-23 22:16:53 At first I was upset about this sponsored post. But then I realized oil and gas are getting nervous enough to push this bullshit.
809 2018-01-23 22:16:48 But wasn’t part of that demand increase due to subsidised retail #oil product prices in high-growth countries?
810 2018-01-23 22:16:46 The U.S. has given Haiti billions in aid.We don't need Haiti's or anyone else's oil,we have our own.Why aren't you criticizing the U.N.who the U.S. for now also gives billions every year?

813 2018-01-23 22:16:29 I didn’t see the tweet before & thought that had to do with oil & gas production 
814 2018-01-23 22:16:15 Why should BC Hydro provide alt. power sources when alt power can be provided more efficiently by domestic and industry tying into the grid?  solar, wind, co-generation, bio-mass.  No #sitec.  Comes down to rowboat vs. oil tanker economic analogy.
815 2018-01-23 22:16:13 Not to mention there's TONS of other countries we can get oil from, buying oil from them even as its prices plummet wont really do much to help as they wouldn't be a main supplier.

822 2018-01-23 22:15:34 I gotta do better with getting my oil changed cause I be letting that shit slide way too long
823 2018-01-23 22:15:32 I have Fatty Liver disease. Need to follow the Mediterrainean Diet...lots of olive oil, leafy greens...with some exclusions and limitations with my Kidney diet. Glucose and cholesterol numbers were beautiful.

825 2018-01-23 22:14:57 Proof positive that @realDonaldTrump is in the pocket of the coal, oil & gas lobby. 
Plus, having only the vestiges of a lizard brain, he thinks clean, green energy is a crazy liberal idea, & wants to hurt us.
826 2018-01-23 22:14:56 No creo q sendic subsidiara el gas oil.sino q pagamos el más caro de la región.y luego hay q competir con ellos en la exportación

828 2018-01-23 22:14:49 Hmm well we have no oil and no internet at my house right now and I think I’m about to f
829 2018-01-23 22:14:47 So I think I’m out of olive oil and I’m not stopping at the store 
830 2018-01-23 22:14:41 Ajaega ! Because you lack a type of oil which is used way beyond its expiry date
831 2018-01-23 22:14:35 Actually there's a documentary by Ian Hislop on the BBC about what happened in the UK in the 60s. The minister at the time owned a road building company. The story is pretty similar in many countries. Oil was cheap, people wanted their own cars. It's a fascinating story
832 2018-01-23 22:14:33 Just henna and coconut oil!

834 2018-01-23 22:14:28 You know that @RepStevePearce is in favor of tariffs on solar equipment, just as he generally opposes all renewable energy development. He's just an oil kinda guy, so we're supposed to share his bias.

838 2018-01-23 22:14:07 Oil price close to $70 again! Marginal costs have been shifting a lot. Great chance for all of the micro economists to get into the price debate!
839 2018-01-23 22:14:07 Hi Megyn. Love how you handled Jane Fonda! She made a statement that the sight of  our Alberta oil sands felt like it was ripping the skin of her entire body  but her face is so tight from nips and tucks    Highly unlikely THERE!!!
840 2018-01-23 22:14:03 It's in that state because it violated basic human rights, aimed to become a police state, has skeevy af people running the oil industries that steal and con money, a president that has screwed everyone over, and the socialist policies that bankrupted the economy issued from-
841 2018-01-23 22:14:01 Condensate is found as a gas phase at reservoir temperature &  pressure (think of it as a mixture of light oil molecules which become gas when heated and compressed to very high pressure. As the gas pressure drops and cools, the condensate molecules turn into a liquid.
842 2018-01-23 22:14:00 Errrm...but, but there were weapons of mass destruction, *cough*
It was never about the oil...honest!
843 2018-01-23 22:13:49 Biafrans love u and lsreal. Buhari is killing biafran Christians and they are counting on u with Trump to speak up to stop these killings and human right abuses so that biafra can be restored. Biafra will partner with lsreal in oil and gas plus other natural minerals.pls us out.
844 2018-01-23 22:13:49 Tea tree oil is the shit I smell like a fuckin forest
845 2018-01-23 22:13:48 Haha - love it. I'll Risk Assess here......the only Risk reduction mechanism is plenty of cod liver oil, bit of Vitamin D and have a secretary to do the Tweeting injury known as #LouthChatRSI 
846 2018-01-23 22:13:46 Have your oil companies pay for it...
847 2018-01-23 22:13:46 Surely it’s a scandal that we don’t have a sovereign wealth fund from the North Sea oil revenues, a once in a lifetime opportunity squandered. If only we’d have thought more like the Norwegians

850 2018-01-23 22:13:22 feedback is important and i will feed back but like my mother used to say as the cod liver oil went down 'it's good for you'....more compression makes a better mammogram (but easy for me to say)
851 2018-01-23 22:13:12 Boris "if we hadn't invaded them, they'd still only be eating plantains," Johnson. There has never been a more racist, elitist, crooked bunch of snake oil salesmen in government.
852 2018-01-23 22:13:10 This must be Trump's fault!  If he can make sure every airline passenger arrives safely, he can surely protect oil workers on the ground.  Or is that what regulations are for?
853 2018-01-23 22:13:08 Big oil not letting go. Unfortunately it's the American way.

855 2018-01-23 22:12:53 And let's not forget about the oil and natural gas! That's way more important than saving the Earth! Yes we should get rid of all the windmills and the solar panels just for 45! 45 is so stupid and ignorant that he's trying to keep his promises to the 32% who support him? WTF?
856 2018-01-23 22:12:44 @edgarwright 
Cut sprouts in half
Sauté chopped scallion in olive oil
Add a bunch of chopped prosciutto (More is tastier)
Add sprouts
Sauté til bright green, still fairly crunchy, 10 minutes?
Add hearty splash white wine
Eat while patting yourself on the back for a great movie

859 2018-01-23 22:12:07 Actinic Keratosis... because laying on the boat in the sun summer after summer with baby oil and iodine was my jam back in the late 80’s and 90’s!  Had a mole removed from my tummy too. Im taking zero chances!
860 2018-01-23 22:12:03 Was it the very sexy?? I used to use that one but wasn’t down to pay $20 each I have a lot of hair!! Lol have you ever tried the keratin oil shampoo? By OGX?
861 2018-01-23 22:11:54 Just rubbed fruit loops scented cuticle oil on my cuticles and feeling to eat them. Is this what wanting to eat a tide pod feels like?
862 2018-01-23 22:11:53 The club has more fans the arab oil club can ever dream of sadly
863 2018-01-23 22:11:51 At this point yes.

I've said it before and I have no trouble saying it, things did improved for a bit during shiabbes, the oil bonanza and all.

But by 2010 things started to decline (and oil prices were still high enough)
864 2018-01-23 22:11:47 It usually takes over an hour to get my oil changed at Walmart; Valvoline got it done in 20 minutes and I didn't even have to get out of my car! Plus the pit crew are WAY friendlier. And cuter 
865 2018-01-23 22:11:15 Me: Ladies and Gentlemen! I think I found oil. 
Cartman: Are you ok? 
Me: Jesus! 
Freezer: Hellooo!

868 2018-01-23 22:11:06 Understood. Solar energy is cheaper than coventional energy in many countries now. Big US oil not wanting that to happen here. In the politician's pockets on both sides as usual.

870 2018-01-23 22:11:02 Over-washing your face removes natural oils which can actually cause your face to over-produce oil. You only need to wash your face 2x a day, once in the morning and once at night. If you have dry skin, wash at night, but just rinse with cold water when you get up #skincare
871 2018-01-23 22:11:02 Fuck off you idiot, the only thing you’re committed to is the control of oil
872 2018-01-23 22:11:00 We have plenty, it’s on GA. defenders defend, attackers attack, midfield oil the cogs and let those do what they are supposed to do...  it’s like Les Dawson playing piano at mo.
873 2018-01-23 22:10:59 Fewer people & some very sensible investment of a large part of their oil revenue into their future....
874 2018-01-23 22:10:58 Yep, that’s a total false equivalence. How can you take these two examples entirely out of their historical context, such as Venezuela being built on petrodollars and the slump in the oil price...?
875 2018-01-23 22:10:57 Just stained a white table with palm oil from my lunch while on break...

877 2018-01-23 22:10:50 So this girl posted a pic of an oil diffuser and kept saying she bought an "infuser" and in the comments people were like "cool I want an infuser too!" . So I corrected her and her reply was "same shit ". But like...no? It's not?

889 2018-01-23 22:09:24 I think that wholly contributed to the Chiefs lack of consistency in 2017. They never found a complementary balance with Reid's new approach on offense. That's why the two sides of the ball could never work together. It was like mixing oil and water.

892 2018-01-23 22:09:03 Quoted article was from Dec 2014, when Oil was down to $55 already. So you were "predicting" what had been going on already and nothing of the "just like 2008" came to pass later on. That's how it looks from here.

947 2018-01-23 22:01:21 I started using jojoba oil on my nails and cuticles for a couple reasons but mainly because mine would get really dry and create hangnails and it would hurt really bad and it's almost completely taken care of that so for me that's the biggest thing!

952 2018-01-23 22:00:45 &, if US wasn't so antagonistic w/ other countries, there'd be no conflict.

You think the "war on terror" in the Middle East is less about terrorism and more about access to oil.

Yes, terrorist exist. But most of the seats are innocent collateral damage, not terrorists.
953 2018-01-23 22:00:45 Toss with olive oil, salt and pepper, and roast them. It actually makes them tasty rather then tiny packages of garbage.

966 2018-01-23 21:59:49 Cut in half, coat with olive oil, add salt, pepper, onion and garlic powder. Roast on a cookie sheet for 40 minutes at 350-375. Or until nice and browned and crispy. Also, CONGRATS!
967 2018-01-23 21:59:46 Of course he did, because he is in the pocket of big oil $. #EndCitizensUnited
968 2018-01-23 21:59:42 This can't bode well for near term futures price if every oil company is doing the same thing. Plus the continuous gasoline builds suggest weakening demand. Hope I am analyzing this right but this could be seriously negative for oil going forward.
969 2018-01-23 21:59:25 dont forget the mafia that controls the Olive Oil industry.
970 2018-01-23 21:59:20 Plot twist he was talking about off shore oil drilling. He is a very wealthy tycoon.
971 2018-01-23 21:59:05 Are you seriously so limited? Comparing a car oil company with... Your fucking stadium is called ETIHAD  (not many people heard of it, never has even half of its capacity in it)
972 2018-01-23 21:58:57 Honest Broker?  Your votes on oil exploration line up with donations by petroleum interests.  Maybe don't throw around the word honest.
973 2018-01-23 21:58:53 That’s the idea. Solar energy, primarily from Chinese panels, is growing so fast, in this country, that Big Oil is feeling threatened
974 2018-01-23 21:58:50 I never knew that pasta and roast veg was so good  the seasonings all work so well together too, plus I think the coconut oil just makes it 
975 2018-01-23 21:58:47 #API shows build in #Crude supplies (this actually helpful for #Oil bulls)- as this sets the bar LOW tonight for tomorrow's #EIA figure. WSJ Survey Estimates from nine analysts show U.S. $CL_F Inventories projected to decrease by 1.9mb on avg... *7 of 9 expect stockpiles to fall.
976 2018-01-23 21:58:44 Needs to be higher like it used to. This study was paid for by an oil industry group plus it head scratchingly includes personal income and sales taxes. Those arent taxes on the industry but on individuals and shouldnt be counted in this slanted study.
977 2018-01-23 21:58:43 The US needs a stranglehold on oil to protect the value of the dollar. China, Russia, Iran, and others are trying to keep USD out of play in the oil industry. That’s why we continually destabilize nations with forced coups and assassinations.
978 2018-01-23 21:58:30 I can't even imagine how awful it would be right now if that crooked, lying, criminal Killary would of been elected. Thank God our oil and gas industry is thriving and ppl have good paying jobs
979 2018-01-23 21:58:29 Such a hateful move to help Trump's oil buddies. My husband and I have been saving up to go solar. We will carpool, shut lights, do what ever we can not to support the fossil fuel industry. What else can we do?
980 2018-01-23 21:58:22 This is morally reprehensible, globally less competitive & will slow the economy. It'll slow one of our leading new industries for future growth too. 

It's pathetic so THANKS #MAGAts for yet another cruel Trump decision. This will hurt you too so buy more oil and gas U idiots.

982 2018-01-23 21:58:13 Same. Plus after buying oil and a filter... I don’t see the savings.
983 2018-01-23 21:58:08 Okay, that makes sense, but oil drilling is a big economy up here in Alaska. The jobs it creates are innumerable, when the oil production slowed, thousands of jobs were lost. Including one that I held down in the Bakken. It may be a risk but the risks are by the big corporations
984 2018-01-23 21:58:05 What a snake oil preacher.

993 2018-01-23 21:57:00 Olive oil is too expensive, so I only use vegetable oil.
994 2018-01-23 21:56:36 Im no oil painting but christ on a bike Phil is a fat bollex #FirstDatesIRL
995 2018-01-23 21:56:33 Y’all know if smoke at least an 8th of flower a week youd save urself almost 25$ a week by switching to oil, it’ll get you, last you longer and save you money... why y’all still take the time to break up bud anyways in fkin 2018
996 2018-01-23 21:56:21 I’m number one for letting my gas tank go to the 2nd to last mile, I hate scheduling oil changes, it took me 3 weeks to fix my car battery, I leave my car parked in the same spot for days. Lacey doesn’t go in DC unless it’s Sunday and parking free 
997 2018-01-23 21:56:08 Do your own research, its all there to see. Expenses €150k and thats best case scenario. Any oil or gas producer working to a best case scenario would be insane.
998 2018-01-23 21:56:00 Someone needs to oil up the hinges on that door.
999 2018-01-23 21:55:55 I hate how dry my hair gets in a weave. It’s like no matter what kind or amount of oil I use it just doesn’t work. I probably haven’t found the right oil.
1000 2018-01-23 21:55:49 You still got the other gig ? I need to come get oil change shit again
1001 2018-01-23 21:55:44 I’m so fucking glad I found a source for CBD oil. It’s considered illegal in this damn state, but without it I’d probably have lost it these last few weeks. It’s amazing stuff.
1002 2018-01-23 21:55:41 If only we could get our oil and gas to the Pacific... that'd be something to celebrate...
1003 2018-01-23 21:55:32 I need a big can of oil sheen rn

1007 2018-01-23 21:55:08 Slaughtering millions for the OIL that flows under their Homeland.
1008 2018-01-23 21:54:34 I want to rub oil on your butt @RealBriaMyles 
1009 2018-01-23 21:54:33 Buy some Avocado oil. It’ll change your life
1010 2018-01-23 21:54:04 Find sounds which allow you to let go and disconnect from too much stimulation. Start with a oil w/fragrance you enjoy. Apply it to neck hands, pillowcase, bit on your blanket. Try a guided hypnotic meditation for deep Zzz’s
1011 2018-01-23 21:54:00 Yeah I’m not finding a way to dispose of oil. They can have my $40.
1012 2018-01-23 21:53:59 brusselS... (cut in half, toss in olive oil, salt, pepper, and a fancypants spice/seasoning of your choice and roast them at 400 until then they're brown and crispy and then thank me)
1013 2018-01-23 21:53:59 What do you think - Humour or a reflection of what we are now as a country? 
Driving behind a van on the M25 today branded w cooking oil I noted big capital letters on the back: 
THERE ARE NO CHIPS LEFT IN THIS VAN OVERNIGHT
1014 2018-01-23 21:53:58 Woke up to an emtpy bottle of brain octane oil. I guess I'm not having #breakfast

1021 2018-01-23 21:53:15 I'm only ever on Twitter when I'm at work feeling all spiritual and shit supposed to be changing these peoples oil
1022 2018-01-23 21:53:09 I also like grated carrot with a mustard seed and cumin olive oil dresssing -  mostly make things up by trial and error#bccww
1023 2018-01-23 21:53:01 @realDonaldTrump you do know that solar employs more Americans than coal and oil combined... right? Your tariff will see 23,000 Americans lose their jobs! So much for caring about job creation. You just are pleasing your donors.
1024 2018-01-23 21:52:47 Very much so. Genie Energy now has dibs on it as they paid Israel for the oil. Genie Energy is a hui of zionist & Christian Zionist scumbags
1025 2018-01-23 21:52:47 I was at the at the Big Ten title game. Lucas Oil is nice but not that special
1026 2018-01-23 21:52:45 I was late for work today and grabbed some sweet potatoes to cook up at the church, ended up using anointing oil to cook them. 

If anyone would like some sweet potatoes now have enough to feed approximately 5,000 men

So come on by
1027 2018-01-23 21:52:33 I just got my oil changed for 20 bucks at Valvoline. Y'all better start googling coupons lol
1028 2018-01-23 21:52:27 Sweet almond oil
1029 2018-01-23 21:52:27 The picture you use in the thumbnail isn't even from Michigan. It is of a oil refinery in Ohio conducting a controled burn to empty a safety valve.
1030 2018-01-23 21:52:22 Does anyone have an oil can I can borrow? The cold weather makes my bot joints feel a bit stiff.
#ReleaseTheMemo
1031 2018-01-23 21:52:21 .@NYCMayor thinks the best way to fix climate change is to sue oil companies for the Industrial Revolution. No wonder our taxes are so high here, our mayor is tilting at windmills. #GlobalWarming
1032 2018-01-23 21:52:17 It's easy to make. Char aubergines over a gas flame or barbecue, then skin, purée with lemon, salt, olive oil, garlic. Delicious!
1033 2018-01-23 21:52:16 China at an entity itself is not condoning or selling N Korea oil. What you are referring to is isolated incidents of smugglers trying to make a buck from the sanctions by smuggling oil into N Korea Google it. Interesting info.China is not cheating on the oil ban though,incorrect
1034 2018-01-23 21:52:13 Don is bringing back coal jobs and big oil. This is what winning looks like?
1035 2018-01-23 21:52:09 My Dad would legit KILL me if I paid for that. He already thinks I'm crazy for paying for an oil change to begin with!

1037 2018-01-23 21:52:03 Saudi Arabia’s abundance of oil is the best justification for advancement of renewables I can think of. #HouseofSaud
1038 2018-01-23 21:52:01 The people who swear they're slick as oil 

Are the same people who get slowed down the most by friction.


1039 2018-01-23 21:52:00 That fact that the Dump administration is enacting tariffs on solar is ridiculous. 30%!! 

Really? 

This is clearly an attempt to strike the renewable industry on the nose for the benefit of oil, coal and gas. #sad
1040 2018-01-23 21:51:53 I have put so much fancy kielhs oil on my face tonight I better wake up fucking radiant or I'll riot
1041 2018-01-23 21:51:17 オリーブ油で毎日を楽しく(*^_^*)
1042 2018-01-23 21:51:16 After spending the week mainly watching the cooking channels, I am pretty sure that if @jamieoliver was to cut himself, he would bleed olive oil instead of blood
1043 2018-01-23 21:51:10 I frequently refer to myself as the "Tin Man!!" Need the "oil can!!!" 
1044 2018-01-23 21:51:05 Trying this wild growth oil out  so far it’s made my head hurt and hair shed
1045 2018-01-23 21:51:03 If it were up to Trump, that would be an apartment building.
1046 2018-01-23 21:50:59 Taxpayers fund them IF that's how they were intially set up. Indy has a CIB and it's a large food and beverage tax that funds Lucas Oil Stadium. If you go to any "donut" county, they pay into this. Indy taxpayers aren't on the hook for the Luke.
1047 2018-01-23 21:50:57 Man where the woke females at? What’s a good alternative to coconut oil, I know y’all know
1048 2018-01-23 21:50:44 So wet the scalp then use castor oil mix then shampoo? I don't use conditioner after I shampoo I use olive/jojoba/coconut.

1050 2018-01-23 21:50:27 @GodIsGoodMotors merely looking at the bus you will know this bus is not in a good condition, the bus spoilt at asaba engine oil was leaking
1051 2018-01-23 21:50:01 It's not incorrect. There's video footage of Turkish military escorting ISIS oil trucks.
1052 2018-01-23 21:49:58 Try roasting them with a little olive oil and garlic salt.  I thought I hated them too, having only had them boiled.  Roasted is sooooo much better!
1053 2018-01-23 21:49:51 They aren't oil and gas. IOW Trump and his cronies live in the Dark Ages.

1059 2018-01-23 21:49:09 The president has an obvious plan. Next he will watch solar prices rise. He will then start talking about how coal and oil are cheaper options.
1060 2018-01-23 21:49:02 オイルの気持ちにもなってよ…
1061 2018-01-23 21:48:59 the world stand with the Kurds! bêje, bêje Kurdistan. Where do you get your oil from???! Isis funder!?!
1062 2018-01-23 21:48:51 Hey here is an idea! Use Puerto Rico as a solar lab. Is there a better place for solar energy? Flat panels can avoid damage from the high winds another plus. Its common sense Mr Whitehouse. Our WH biz genius cant see past his Trump cut from the  oil titans.
1063 2018-01-23 21:48:49 Ladies...start using coconut oil to take off your makeup. It works wonders 
1064 2018-01-23 21:48:41 What an amazing transformation, Jeremy! Oil Rubbed Bronze looks perfect on this piece.

1075 2018-01-23 21:47:18 Chicas compren coconut oil y apliquen a su cara en las noches o en las mañanas. Es lo mejor. Me lo agradecerán

1077 2018-01-23 21:47:05 I forget how shitty philly weed and oil is til i come to Cali lol
1078 2018-01-23 21:47:02 This reminds me of when I bet everything that Sarah Palin would be John McCain's VP candidate in February of 2008 (because she was the only GOP Gov who didn't have to raise taxes OR cut programs: oil was $$$$ that year) - but none of it was real money.
1079 2018-01-23 21:47:01 The doctors told me that 70% of my veins is blood now. They said they were concerned and started pouring oil down my gullet.
1080 2018-01-23 21:46:54 Seriously, I'm a virgin! Where do you think they get virgin olive oil?
1081 2018-01-23 21:46:53 Hemp oil is my saving gace mixed with vitamin c oil. Acne is gone, and my skin glows. I’m a new woman.

1093 2018-01-23 21:45:33 İf allies with isis why eu/us and russia doenst make any noise anywhere.its unrealistic sorry. İ remember some İsis oil trade news made by russians after the jet down and american said that's incorrect! İsis killed hundreds of people in Turkey in last couple years
1094 2018-01-23 21:45:30 Q Why did the Arabs get oil and the Irish get potatoes?
A The Irish had first pick.
1095 2018-01-23 21:45:29 I like that I get $4 oil changes  & $3 state inspections
1096 2018-01-23 21:45:14 Putting coal and oil before solar is sending USA back from 21 century to early 19th.  Trump SIMPLY DOES NOT CARE about the environment, the future or the 23k plus Americans affected by his decision.  2020 cannot come soon enough
1097 2018-01-23 21:45:05 Tax imported sugar and palm oil, save American lives.
1098 2018-01-23 21:45:03 Is "unload my cargo of crude oil" a metaphor for something?
1099 2018-01-23 21:45:01 Got a oil change ready for a tune up
1100 2018-01-23 21:45:01 Ok, frying it is. Will have to be a shallow pan as I don’t have a deep fat fryer. Final question, promise.... what is best kind of oil?
1101 2018-01-23 21:44:59 1. cheap solar panels benefit the consumer
2. tariffs increase the cost of solar & reduce demand
3. higher solar costs benefit coal/oil, but increases CO2
4. CO2+ means more frequent/severe storms/flooding/drought
5. trump can cut solar taxes to reduce CO2 & create jobs
1102 2018-01-23 21:44:57 there were able to dump
a lot of oil at one time, but
they could only use it
once.. moonshiners on #discovery
1103 2018-01-23 21:44:49 Thank you for your reply but sadly I do not accept it.  The oil used in plastics' creation will eventually run out.  It's bad for the environment when it's discarded.  Please find suitable supplier for paper bags.  Possible to find like for like placement.  1/2
1104 2018-01-23 21:44:39 You're killing America by thwarting all the growth and investment opportunities of green energy. 
   Does this come from lobbyist bribes or from favoring Russian oil?
1105 2018-01-23 21:44:35 Egypt’s GASC bought 40,000 MT of soybean oil (30,000 MT at 821 $/mt c&f (with facilities 180 days) from ADM and 10,000 MT at 14,377 EGP/mt (812 $/mt) from Watanya/Cargill) and 16,500 MT of sunflower oil at 792.75 $/mt c&f (with facilities 180 days) from Aston for Mar5-20 delivery
1106 2018-01-23 21:44:20 Exactly. And olive oil. Wow! #travel #TTOT
1107 2018-01-23 21:44:18 I made a pre workout salad of spinach, apples, chickpeas, hard boiled egg, and olive oil vinaigrette and this is so good omg I’m ready for the gym later

1109 2018-01-23 21:44:15 Oddly, all we really have to trade in TPP is oil, gas, coal, lumber.... all things the #LPC is trying to kill...
1110 2018-01-23 21:44:00 The greatest asset, even in this country, is not oil and gas. It's integrity. Everyone is searching for it, asking, 'Who can I do business with that I can trust?'

1115 2018-01-23 21:43:15 Yeah I just had a total meltdown they always have to make some shit up to get more money and throw a fit when I say no. It took over an hour to get my oil changed and that, plus the time I spent arguing with them abt whether or not my tire was “going to blow any second” -
1116 2018-01-23 21:43:04 oil money wins another trophy

1118 2018-01-23 21:42:59 Put them in a foil bag w/olive oil & garlic. Roast on grill at 425 for 1/2 hour. @kumailn will love them.
1119 2018-01-23 21:42:50 Just boil them first, then ice bath, chop them thin, spread on a baking sheet with diced bacon, and some diced serrano peppers, a little garlic and oil.

Bake that for about 15-20. You can put all that on a pasta, or pizza, or just eat it.

1134 2018-01-23 21:41:39 Have a friend who works for an oil co. in West Texas .. he says drilling is thru the roof as his company is in drilling overdrive mode to leverage current prices.
1135 2018-01-23 21:41:39 I mean Russia is a big producer of oil. I don't see why it's a stretch to see them as potential winners if the US continues to enact policy that is pro-oil.
1136 2018-01-23 21:41:39 Down 40 cents in 10 minutes. Glorious. On #OOTT, some of the #OOTTmoron s are already saying that the numbers make no sense. As @Oil_Tradr said, once bull markets end, quacks get exposed.
1137 2018-01-23 21:41:36 And this Pres wants to befriend Russia. I can't say positively but looks like Russia may be sending oil tankers to the U. S. now!

1152 2018-01-23 21:40:30 The problem is not supply. Plenty of oil available now in N. America w/o one more well. We pay more for gas because of outsourcing our refining which is just as bad if not worse for environment

1184 2018-01-23 21:38:12 No...you have it backwards. The only reason solar is competitive is due to the amount of tax breaks that they get. It’s subusidized at a much higher amount per unit of energy than oil/gas/nuclear.

1273 2018-01-23 21:29:57 Some people: Why should we secure the border?  If someone really wants to get in they’ll just use a visa. 
Same people: They shouldn’t be able to round up overstays like that.
1274 2018-01-23 21:29:44 Let there be oil in my lamp, Let the fire not go out, When I hear the Bridegroom comes! 
1275 2018-01-23 21:29:41 I use coconut oil spray on the pan and it’s better to cook them lower heat for longer time! Takes some trial and error for sure haha
1276 2018-01-23 21:29:33 @SivahnArt when you paint, do you use oil brushes?
1277 2018-01-23 21:29:31 Hell, I'd eat some warm oil right now if you had some
1278 2018-01-23 21:29:25 I won't buy any Peanut Butter with Palm Oil in it! #panda #peanutbutter #PalmOil
1279 2018-01-23 21:29:20 If President Buhari is being criticized in his own bedroom, by persons who eat his pepper and palm oil, what moral right does anybody have to silence critics of his administration?

1282 2018-01-23 21:29:04 Trump is trying to take down the solar industry for his friends in big oil by adding a 30% tax on imported solar panels. 80% of all solar panels used in America are imported - & solar wind & are providing many jobs, & growing. Big oil & old white power are in a death spiral.
1283 2018-01-23 21:29:01 Sitting here waiting for my oil to get changed & this chick across from me won’t stop fucking staring
1284 2018-01-23 21:28:55 Hello to the fine ass Latino daddy changing my oil right now
1285 2018-01-23 21:28:33 #CadetBoneSpurs just threw 23,000 Americans out of work to add a 25% tariff on foreign-made solar panels. The US produces about 2% of panels worldwide. 

@GOP Trump did this to stall renewable energy adoption and help big oil. Once more, dragging America back to the dark ages.
1286 2018-01-23 21:28:29 ♡: How was your day?
Tomorrow I will paint with oil for the first time!!

1289 2018-01-23 21:28:20 I like calcium oil, but that holmium oil is calling my name.
1290 2018-01-23 21:28:04 LOL...Trump “donated” his $400K salary to:

$72K: Two National Parks battlefields ($230M under budget at time of gift).

Later gave away National Parks land to oil + gas interests, axed budget by 13%, cut 1000+ jobs. Added $30M to budget deficit, raised park entrance fees by 280%
1291 2018-01-23 21:27:59 and i did get a sample for i been places that are magical. But only when i was young and i think drilling oil and doing the most damage,
1292 2018-01-23 21:27:44 Coconut oil and water fixes everything
1293 2018-01-23 21:27:37 And what are you and those employees going to do about it?  Complain or speak up and speak out about man who only supports coal, oil and gas development and opens up our most precious lands for mining and drilling?
1294 2018-01-23 21:27:36 Reason 15: The Port of Vancouver voted unanimously on January 9, 2018 to cancel the lease for the oil terminal.

People are losing jobs in Alberta because of an oil crisis! Illegal immigrants are pouring from US at the southern border! The country has a debt!
But gender pay gap is very real and definitely exists. We need equality.

1305 2018-01-23 21:25:50 @thekrissychula hey I was wondering if you could advise me on something. Do you use castor oil? If so do you use it before shampoo or after? Or at the least can you tell me of any resources I can look at about it? Google sends me to white websites.
1306 2018-01-23 21:25:49 Where have I seen this before oil looking like it's heading down some but wait higher, bull trap have fun holding that all summer waiting for recovery oil is going to amp up at these prices people making bank$uwt
1307 2018-01-23 21:25:47 Like stupid James Woods “White House Down” & “London Down” movies & lefty “McCarthyite” conspiracies ab’t 2014’s oil price coinciding w Ron Paul, Giuliani, Buchanan, Peters, civilian 45 rating Skinhead Putin over “O” >>GOP power base yrs ahead of Mueller.

1309 2018-01-23 21:25:22 I know. but there's so much grease and oil and beans I think it would send me straight to the bathroom
1310 2018-01-23 21:25:08 *BREAKING NEWS!! *

The enemies have done their worst . . . 

Just when we are complaining about fuel/oil scarcity. Some wicked people have secretly reduced the oil inside Titus sardine. 

. . . I suspect NNPC!!! laugh  jare and enjoy
1311 2018-01-23 21:25:05 I honestly think that until oil actually runs out, this planet will be under the heel of the oil companies, which means very little will change
1312 2018-01-23 21:25:05 roast it. or fry in butter (or olive oil) and garlic. 
it tastes great!
1313 2018-01-23 21:25:03 @mfa_russia Do you ever remember RT TV streaming 2 years ago? Yourself you're accusing Turkey of supporting ISS! Just search on YouTube! You were taking live Videos how Turkey were dealing with ISIS and buying their Crude Oil? Did you Forget that? Or you're too Pragmatist?!
1314 2018-01-23 21:25:02 Earlier today, I kept putting on my gen and it kept turning itself off. After the umpteenth attempt, I checked the oil gauge and found it absolutely dry.

I nearly wept tears of joy as I blessed it for not knocking. Ah.

1317 2018-01-23 21:24:19 I hope it is. Let's pray for a build, or at least a draw that is way less than estimates.
1318 2018-01-23 21:24:12 i am literally watching a girl eat coconut oil out of a jar with a spoon.... #justwholefoodsthings
1319 2018-01-23 21:23:50 Roast them with olive oil, salt, and pepper until they're crispy on the outside. Or fry them up with diced bacon. Both ways are great!
1320 2018-01-23 21:23:44 World rally continues: US & Europe +.2%. With solid US earnings & no reason to decline market momentum continued. Oil price & interest-rate increases signal solid economic growth. For risk-sensitive investors, rally signals may be time to rebalance.

1322 2018-01-23 21:23:04 @AmericanPicker Mike Wolfe  Learned from show last night:  Electric cars in early 1900's were quiet & easy to drive making them just as popular as gas-powered vehicles.  Then huge oil discovery.:(  How depressing is that?  Gasoline could've been avoided.
1323 2018-01-23 21:22:57 When in doubt, throw some truffle oil on it
1324 2018-01-23 21:22:57 You're missing my point, think we r on the same side here. This oil/coal vs solar/renewable to me is much more about pandering to his base & making life tough on states that voted against him.

1329 2018-01-23 21:22:19 u lost me when u said baby oil. stop using that garbage

1332 2018-01-23 21:22:04 No, they're well aware. The problem is lobbying by oil companies in Congress
1333 2018-01-23 21:22:03 You can't ban somebody from your Country then going making money with his oil.
1334 2018-01-23 21:22:02 i told these 2 clowns specifically so many times about Genie Oil+Gas but they just kept pushing MisInfo on Syria to discredit McMasters for their source Bannon.  Look where Bannon at now calling Trump Jr. treasonous. Complete Disgrace this whole part of MAGA Movement.

1338 2018-01-23 21:21:51 haha... you never ignored me

Last period like this was in 2008 - in fact we never fully recovered from that one.
The recession, layoffs, and oil glut started before the NDP ever got into office. The worst of it hit the year they were elected and the recovery the year after that.
1339 2018-01-23 21:21:47 Need to oil my joints again. I swear, sometimes I feel like the tin man from the wizard of oz =A=

#Dow closed flat on mixed corporate earnings. 

#Oil up 1.9% to $64.77. 
#Gold up, to $1,230, 
#Copper 2.5% down 
#IronOre dips 

When will ASX recover from last wks losses? 
1341 2018-01-23 21:21:40 I’ll pass. I’d rather drink old diesel oil.
1342 2018-01-23 21:21:37 3 at this rate 4 they push it up on spring plus oil going higher oil hits 80 back to 5 that will be the death of oil

1345 2018-01-23 21:21:24 It's been leaked from a memo that Trump intends to PRIVATIZE OUR WATER RESOURCES !  To big oil !  How better to control the masses and rape our wallets!  VOTE BLUE EVERYWHERE YOU CAN!  IMPEACH !

1347 2018-01-23 21:21:15 A Reuters poll found that crude oil inventories in the US probably declined by 1.3 million bbls last week, marking the 10th week of declines. Gasoline volumes are expected to have increased by 2.44 million bbls, while distillates are seen down by 1.6 million bbls.

1350 2018-01-23 21:21:10 >What if
It's already for certain that US intelligence orchestrated this to enact regime changes and get control of oil. Issue is, every group they armed and put in power soon turned against the US.

You think the Free Syrian Army is not despising America?
1351 2018-01-23 21:21:05 How do you sue oil companies over the climate? Do you own the climate?
1352 2018-01-23 21:21:02 I hope the Military seize on the climate change policies they had before Trump’s remarkable ‘about-face’ and recognise they could be responding to wars over water-not oil and rescuing victims from severe weather.
1353 2018-01-23 21:20:58 Once again working to damage solar installs and benefit oil and coal.
1354 2018-01-23 21:20:53 Yall wanna know why we are under paid?.... When will you ever see a women at an oil refinery in the gulf of mexico? NEVER. YOU WILL SEE HERE ASS AT UEI COLLEGE!
1355 2018-01-23 21:20:47 Happens as money switches around... It means the MM's are loading on the contracts again.  But it could be short lived if EIA shows a build.
1356 2018-01-23 21:20:42 Well that makes sense... If you're into snake oil salesmen and alchemy ! Oh and blind hope
1357 2018-01-23 21:19:56 Sirji don't think there is collateral damage to happen to Indian economy due to rising oil prices?

1369 2018-01-23 21:18:48 I am sooooo in love with your packaging! I can’t tell how much I think it’s brilliant 
1370 2018-01-23 21:18:47 Canada produces 1.6% of global CO2 while having 9% of global forests, Saudi Arabia produces 1.5% of global CO but has 0% of global forests, so it would be far better for the world to buy Canadian oil so as to lower Saudi Arabia's CO2 emissions. We are CO2 Negative. They are not.
1371 2018-01-23 21:18:47 right? it's solid. a little olive oil + parm and some good bread with it and you're DONE.

1387 2018-01-23 21:16:17 Nooo, roasting with olive oil is by far the best way to cook them. Steaming is second only to boiling as the worst. Everyone I know who hates them grew up eating them boiled or steamed.
1388 2018-01-23 21:16:16 Billionaires reinvest. Then they become multi billionaires. And guys like me get jobs from them opening auto plants or hotels or drilling for oil. So I’m cool with that.

1404 2018-01-23 21:14:27 All day I have been telling my teachers about how 17 million barrels of oil are used each year to make plastic water bottles and out of 50 billion 80% goes into landfill (wonder who I leaned all these facts off)Earlier I also bought a stainless steel water bottle for school

1412 2018-01-23 21:13:14 USDCAD trades to new session lows.   NAFTA hopes.  Higher oil. Trying the downside again.
There is a lot of chop in the USDCAD chart, but the pair is trading at new session lows, and is trying to turn the tide to a more bearish bias.
1413 2018-01-23 21:13:11 Turn it into a ww2 AU where the track guy's sent on base to photograph the war effort. And they meet while Phil's trying to get the brass to fix his bomber. Covered in oil and annoyed. Make's for plenty a pretty picture

1421 2018-01-23 21:11:58 Be thankful you don't have the oil
1422 2018-01-23 21:11:47 False. Growing global demand for transportation fuels increased crude oil price.

1428 2018-01-23 21:11:00 Something weird happened at the time of the first oil crisis in the 1970s. Things started to change then. Like the Texas oil millionaires got worried and started to pull a lot of strings.

1441 2018-01-23 21:09:56 I have few options on..  SPY PUTs that are even.   Waiting for next cycle and a few earnings plays.   I do not trade OIL.  I got whacked in it before.

1443 2018-01-23 21:09:44 You can google obama anti coal regulation. There's plenty of info. Then also look up coal ETF's KOL and oil ETF UCO.  You will see a positive outcome on fossil fuels the first year under Trump.

1447 2018-01-23 21:09:12 So like where can I apply to rub oil on these females asses before they have to shoot? 
1448 2018-01-23 21:09:05 Hi @tasnimshah_ i’ve been having sleeping problems lately and i always saw you up late at this hour too. I hope you’re doing fine and may Allah bless whatever you’re doing (assuming you’re burning the midnight oil) Hope you notice me 
1449 2018-01-23 21:08:57 i‘ve been using Dr. Dennis Gross 2 Minute Skin Fix and Biossance squalane oil and a couple different moisture masks and i think it’s helping
1450 2018-01-23 21:08:51 I really don't like the idea of trading Maroon. Unless you know without a doubt that he's walking. I know there's the cap to consider but the Oil need to keep good NHL players. He's not having am incredible year, but it's just more production they need to replace.
1451 2018-01-23 21:08:40 Have you tried putting oil into your lotion?
1452 2018-01-23 21:08:30 Service costs should be low,no engine to service, oil to change etc etc
1453 2018-01-23 21:08:13 How did you fry it please did you pour juice in the oil??
1454 2018-01-23 21:08:12 My fingers need to produce less oil.

1457 2018-01-23 21:07:35 It’ll soon maybe hit the $80 “you greedy bastards are going to take the oil”, and might even hit the $90 “it’s far too volatile” level.

1460 2018-01-23 21:07:31 @Hodor  I do not eat corn, soy, canola oil and wheat (cannot be trusted).
Why?  When I learned Monsanto products include aspartame which I believe hurt my health,I read the history which is dark (agent orange). Bayer also has a dark history (gas chambers).

1462 2018-01-23 21:07:20 So Donald trump has "dealt his first blow" to the chinese economy. How? Foreign made solar panels. So for short term financial gains he is dooming us to oil and coal for a few more decades and all the fun that goes with those. Bye reefs. Bye blue sky. Bye clean water. Bye bye bye
1463 2018-01-23 21:07:19 i think Dr. Dennis Gross 2 Minute Skin Fix and Biossance squalane oil have been helping a lot

1470 2018-01-23 21:06:45 Well, not exactly. :D I do make my own kimchi, but that's with daikon radish, napa cabbage, salt, fish oil and red pepper flakes. In the ballpark, I suppose. Call this lazy person's kimchi. :D
1471 2018-01-23 21:06:43 I really don't get the pussy hat. Can you imagine a bunch of guys protesting with dick hats? Why should I take anyone who wears these things seriously?
1472 2018-01-23 21:06:38 I teach people in my community how 2 make more , 2 complete a tax return, 2 grow veggies, sew, bake, cook, change oil, tires & fill fluids in their cars. Most of these lessons aren't taught at home or in school. How will they learn if no one teaches? Community matters
1473 2018-01-23 21:06:33 Very long way to go let’s get our oil to Shoreline so we can pay for all these very expensive programs that you dream of!
1474 2018-01-23 21:06:32 The best turkey sandwich is roast beef, sharp cheddar, lettuce, onions, salt, pepper, oil and vinegar on a roll.

1476 2018-01-23 21:06:23 Yes they will if oil prices increase, that’s how this stuff works. Also look at the at the DRC which is an absurd amount of wealth in natural resources, yet is completely open to capitalist exploitation and therefore one of the poorest countries in the world
1477 2018-01-23 21:06:18 ‘Ancient Africans used oils & incense smoke for healing therapeutic reasons. For example, Myrhh oil was used for anti-septic energies, Quassia for tonic effect, Gum Arabic for birth control & Sandalwood for spiritual effect.’

1517 2018-01-23 21:03:29 Heads up for oil traders - inventory data due at the bottom of the hour The private survey inventory data. Official US government data will follow Wednesday morning (US time).
- Expected for the headline is fall by 1.6 million barrels (Reuters survey) - this would be a 10th …
1518 2018-01-23 21:03:28 Does your Company Need an Oil Change or a New Engine?  -
1519 2018-01-23 21:03:27 You're right US doesn't need the oil.

But neocons in the government and their globalist central bank backers want everything.

Anyway just watch what happens to Afrin and think long and hard if coalition actually cares about Kurdish people.

1522 2018-01-23 21:03:07 Need a new stadium as well. Already outdated, should have done it right the first time. Hell, drive to Indy and their stadium swallows up their downtown. Lucas oil field is MASSIVE!! The house that Peyton Manning built. Maybe they should rename Lucas oil stadium to Peyton's house
1523 2018-01-23 21:03:05 if i roast some capsicum off & put it in oil is it gonna keep, or am i gonna need to do some pickling as well...?
1524 2018-01-23 21:02:57 Oil change is completed and I’m digging thru my purse looking for the car keys!! “It’s in the car ma’am.” Well shit.
1525 2018-01-23 21:02:48 The thing is, suing big pharma - just like suing big oil - is good politics, but I'm not sure what it will change in the near short term. Gets him some good headlines, though!
1526 2018-01-23 21:02:45 Very true. I think electric vehicles would have been around for years & years, but the rich oil producers bought or suppressed the plans & patents.#TradesTalk

1536 2018-01-23 21:02:15 Why are the Germans acting suprised? Turkey were exposed trading oil with ISIS in 2014 Turkey are allies of the Islamic State and they're helping them fight the Kurds.

1545 2018-01-23 21:00:51 Happy Birthday and Godbless… and you should look into cannabis oil, it’s not for everyone but you should do your own research.
1546 2018-01-23 21:00:49 Americans, if Brits give you stick about saying "gasoline", remind us that we originated it. The word was initially a brand name, named for John Cassell, an English publisher, who sold it as "Cazoline Oil." Later, it became "Gasolene" (Britain, 1862) and then "Gasoline" (1863).
1547 2018-01-23 21:00:47 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies;
You anoint my head with oil;
My cup runs over.
Psalm 23:5
1548 2018-01-23 21:00:42 Apply almond oil around the mouth to keep your lips supple and soften the lines.
1549 2018-01-23 21:00:24 And the positives of the price of oil and other economic indicators, we hope a massive overhaul of infrastructure and good governance coupled with a focus on human development will spur this great economy into a sprint such that we envisage a growth rate of bla bla bla.
1550 2018-01-23 21:00:23 Used to live two doors down from an oil rig (my town is almost entirely oil and agricultural) and we heard explosions sometimes XD

1553 2018-01-23 21:00:12 Want silk-like skin, fast? After a shower, while your skin's still damp, apply olive oil all over your body and pat dry with a damp towel #skincare

1555 2018-01-23 20:59:59 Thanks Tom! That looks like weather not oil. But a strange feature for sure.
1556 2018-01-23 20:59:54 Now, that is beautiful.  Although i know that this govt is killing oil industry in Canada. 
1557 2018-01-23 20:59:43 And so, by the way, do the shareholders of oil and gas companies, who stand to lose through their lack of awareness as the energy industry transitions to low-carbon electricity.
1558 2018-01-23 20:59:41 Prayers coming your way.  Put some relaxing oil in your diffuser.  
1559 2018-01-23 20:59:35 BBL Commodities, one of the world’s largest #oil-focused hedge funds, believes #Brent crude will climb to $80/bbl this year as stockpiles drop rapidly on the back of production cuts made by #OPEC & its allies.
1560 2018-01-23 20:59:30 hey Bertie have I just seen scum getting on  the oil wagon  no shame them turds
1561 2018-01-23 20:59:25 Only for coal, gas and oil hey bronny, otherwise it’s socialism. Would you stop putting this backwards person on at least try and get her thinking up to the 20th century
1562 2018-01-23 20:59:23 Right. But how dare we describe their legislation as "well-intended." I would think that my derision of yet another attempt at oil taxes when it obviously won't go anywhere would come across but I guess I'll have to be more considerate of the industry types.
1563 2018-01-23 20:59:19 Drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle salt and pepper, then Roast them in the oven on a baking sheet at 400 degrees F for 15-20 minutes.  So good!!! Like candy!!
1564 2018-01-23 20:59:16 He's 6 months away from going full on Mr Burns and attempting to block out the sun because oil lobbyists asked him to.
1565 2018-01-23 20:59:01 Lol honestly if you get like the oil to put on afterward and YOU yourself place the strips, it’s not as bad.. my bf just didn’t have a clue as to how to place or what direction to pull them 
1566 2018-01-23 20:58:53 Roast with salt, pepper, and olive oil and eat with kewpie mayo

1568 2018-01-23 20:58:23 holy shit ... I've literally had an $8 bottle of rosehip oil in my amazon cart for 2 weeks debating if it's worth it or not smdh
1569 2018-01-23 20:58:23 GOD I HATE IN SEX AND THE CITY WHEN BIG IS SUCH A JERK ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO SMOKE THE CIGAR IN THE RESTAURANT.
1570 2018-01-23 20:58:16 Feeling like a new person after that massage. The masseuse used Shea Moisture body oil and I’m feeling luscious
1571 2018-01-23 20:58:13 oil is about 40 cents above my final short add...its likely the last leg and it looks very sloppy and very weak
1572 2018-01-23 20:58:13 For the past 3 months US crude stockpiles have been drawing down at a rate of 1 million barrels per day and its accelerating. 

At that rate, by the end of summer, US stockpiles will be around the same level they were in spring 2008, when oil was $140...
1573 2018-01-23 20:58:10 The Chinese port oil spill was the size of Paris. Using only fossil fuels already on tap we go way over #Paris agreement.  They could’ve moved with the times by investing in renewables. 
Chose not to.  time for fossil fuels to take bow out

1575 2018-01-23 20:57:41 Yeesh, that sucks.
Went to get my oil changed and get a few electronic stuff looked at.
They saw my front 2 tires were almost spent. They rotated them to the back so I wouldn't end up in a ditch on the way to a tire place.
Price for oil, tires, fuse, and bulbs is around $400.

1580 2018-01-23 20:57:23 For shiny and healthy hair, mash an avocado, and a tablespoon of olive oil, and rub it through your hair. Wash your hair after 15 minutes
1581 2018-01-23 20:57:19 Let’s hope he now gets bought in the oil auction, Aussie stint will be a good advert
1582 2018-01-23 20:57:18 It was IMF growth forecast today that triggered bullish buying. The world growth narrative is alive and well. It's just speculation that such growth (if it happens) will lead to more oil demand. That isn't always the case as far as I know. I wonder what @oilfractals thinks.
1583 2018-01-23 20:57:15 "For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:" ~Proverbs 5:3 #God

1585 2018-01-23 20:57:07 So NOTHING to say about the shooter by in Kentucky orvthe Oil Rig Explosion.... please learn how to be a leader
1586 2018-01-23 20:57:05 The production of plastic bottles uses 17 million barrels of oil and 2.5 millions of carbon dioxide annually and it takes 3 times the amount of water to make the plastic bottle as it does to fill it.

1589 2018-01-23 20:57:01 Dab & oil culture has done to marijuana, what douchebag's that carry around an acoustic guitar did to Rock music.
1590 2018-01-23 20:56:59 There is less choice at Aldi and Lidl in terms of variety of stock. However, I don't need 50 varieties of olive oil to choose from so I don't mind. They stock what we need, what more do we want? 
1591 2018-01-23 20:56:52 Win Mch canola up A$4.20/t & EU rape up A$1.58. Support from soyoil & palm oil. Support from dry weather in Argentina but gains to Brazil’s soy crop could cover Argentine losses. Canola looking expensive & limited Chinese interest.
1592 2018-01-23 20:56:47 You really need to clear out a whole days schedule when you get your oil changed... It literally takes 13 hours
1593 2018-01-23 20:56:30 There's more money to be made in fossil fuels. 2016 we saw a record consumption in oil and the US has Surpassed Saudi Arabia in oil production. The money is in fossil fuels.
1594 2018-01-23 20:56:23 Que t’apprécies une personne ou non, quand tu promets sur celle ci, tu la tiens. Ça reste une PROMESSE vos races.
1595 2018-01-23 20:56:23 He’s big oil.
1596 2018-01-23 20:56:14 reckless comments;how do you plan on driving your vehicle or heating your home without NG or oil;no wonder nobody votes for you
1597 2018-01-23 20:56:01 Katherine - that is way too simplistic. I have made my choice; to switch to an air source heat pump powered by renewable electricity. It costs peanuts to run and is great for the environment. Oil and gas is a dying industry and rightfully so - we need to think of the future.
1598 2018-01-23 20:55:59 You turn around, and there he is, already scowling at your choice of olive oil.
1599 2018-01-23 20:55:54 The soaring stock market combined with a resurgence in the price of oil means that a whole bunch of really rich boosters have recently become a whole lot richer, so coaches with big buyouts are way less safe than they were in 2008
1600 2018-01-23 20:55:52 #Stocks rise on earning as #tech rallies! #Oil gains! #USD declines!
1601 2018-01-23 20:55:46 Yep Kathy. Both have a strong oil and gas sector that power the nations, provide good jobs and feed families. But of course you think pixy dust does that.
1602 2018-01-23 20:55:45 Luis believes in GW

He just doesn’t think the A part has any real significance

He also thinks that the A part will suffer badly in QOL if oil and gas use is curtailed without an economically priced substitute

I think he hates pollution too
But thinks CO2 is not, or is least
1603 2018-01-23 20:55:38 Beard oil and moisturiser- helped me

1605 2018-01-23 20:54:45 farewell to the last bottle of this DOP olive oil i got regifted a box of, we had a good run 
1606 2018-01-23 20:54:34 Not just Florida, the World needs protection. Only reason Florida was spared was because it is where Mar A Largo is. Trump was threatened with oil rigs within his view and pulled Florida out of it. Only Florida. Everywhere else needs a Trump hotel nearby to be spared.
1607 2018-01-23 20:54:34 @realDonaldTrump So, let me get this straight; you're willfully destroying solar businesses here in the US... and that's WINNING??? You are SUCH an idiot... and in Big Oil's pocket, obviously (Putin's too) #TrumpResign #TrumpRussia #TrumpKochStooge #TrumpTreason #TrumpTakesBribes
1608 2018-01-23 20:54:32 All you have is talking points. If you think somehow the UCP will magically change everything that aint good enough bub.... you need to tell me exactly HOW they will change anything. They don't control the oil industry any more than the NDP does.
1609 2018-01-23 20:54:29 So I go to get my oil changed. Not only is it $25 more than expected, 3 other cars have same appt as me, so the wait is 2 hours. Then they have the audacity to not have a SINGLE plug in the waiting area. NTB 
1610 2018-01-23 20:54:23 It’s actually a blend of extra virgin olive oil, oregano & seasoned pepper with a splash of fresh lemon.

1616 2018-01-23 20:52:58 Behold the power of the oil lobby. We all lose.
1617 2018-01-23 20:52:56 :-( ---- I remind myself that the original ligthhouse builders and engineers would have gone for LEDs that flash if they could and not oil lamps with lenses that rotate. They were all about efficiency, after all. But still, I miss Noss Head's sweeping beam.
1618 2018-01-23 20:52:54 It will go up as Russia & Saudi r manipulating the oil market for their benefits
1619 2018-01-23 20:52:43 Sautee them in olive oil with some bacon bits and sprinkle with Parmesan.   Yum!!

1623 2018-01-23 20:51:59 My mechanic called me with a “I heard you’ve been beating on that car, you’re 12,000 over your oil change and you like to drive reckless, knock it off and bring your car in”
1624 2018-01-23 20:51:55 Think about the states that support things like solar energy? Think about the states that support oil/coal, etc?  Still think it's about job creation?
1625 2018-01-23 20:51:40 Basically Trump seems to be doing anything to allow fossil fuel companies to prosper. This is madness when you consider how volatile the cost of a barrel of oil can be. 
#LandoftheDissapointment

1627 2018-01-23 20:51:30 If able to attend, I would ask why a sizable popn of Black Oil Beetle (only Notts 2nd) was allowed to go extinct just 4 years after discovery on NCC parkland. ALL were fully informed, no protection offered. No subsequent response from NCC despite my emails, phone calls & a letter
1628 2018-01-23 20:51:21 What’s your view on growing oil prices?

1632 2018-01-23 20:50:56 When JPMC/VIRTU PARTNERS took over the CCM 3 yrs. ago gas spiked 50% in 5 seconds, Since then they've taken gas/heating oil up because Jay Clayton hasn't done his job since appointed by TRUMP. Jay Clayton is the never seen SEC Chairman who could stop this.
1633 2018-01-23 20:50:45 For #SMSportsIU, My most memorable sports-related moment was watching the Colts miracle come back against the Chiefs in the 2014 Wild Card Game from Lucas Oil Stadium.
1634 2018-01-23 20:50:21 Would somebody please tell the Big Orange Head, President of Oppositeland, to put a 30% tariff on oil? #oppositeland
1635 2018-01-23 20:50:16 You need a better picture of these specific oil rigs in the "evidence" up close to show how big they are in reality.
1636 2018-01-23 20:49:57 The US military is the largest consumer of fossil fuels on the planet..  it’s to their benefit to reduce it and consider alternatives. Taxes are paying the oil companies for the DOD fuel

1642 2018-01-23 20:49:21 @wholeearthfoods My smooth peanut butter contained so much oil it should be called peanut SAUCE or maybe SOUP.  Last time I tried Whole Earth was the same thing.

1650 2018-01-23 20:48:52 It's all about oil and gas development because it means huge campaign contributions to this guy.  I won't write his name because he loves it too much.
1651 2018-01-23 20:48:29 Will you stop! There's a demand for solar energy.there's also a decent amount of companies out there installing the systems.there's also a demand for old reliable,oil. Diesel engines aren't going away anytime soon.that tesla truck is completely useless in my field of trucking.
1652 2018-01-23 20:48:20 Why do you have 3 glasses of motor oil in your flight?
1653 2018-01-23 20:48:18 What I meant by infrastructures are not necessarilly only #pipelines in US, they could be pipelines in #Canada & more #refineries around there to avoid moving #oil across the countries but it is a no-brainer that pipelines are better options than using trains for moving Oil!

1662 2018-01-23 20:47:01 Oh dear. You know little of energy policy I see. Perhaps if you monitored supply & demand you'd see no one cares about coal anymore & at low prices, no one wants to dig more oil up either. It's a global market. US prices are part of that market. Boo hoo for the poorly educated.
1663 2018-01-23 20:46:58 .@green_i4u Thank you! #MAGA! OIL. poor coverage about Pinehurst translates into poor television!

1666 2018-01-23 20:46:34 THANK YOU for the THERAPY TRACY... My brains hurt... I did this 3 times today.... BOGUS! and yesterday the easy money... wasn't in me to trade... thinking of venturing into OIL... any thghts! Hope you made $$
1667 2018-01-23 20:46:33 both blades are made out of spring steel that’s been oil quenched
1668 2018-01-23 20:46:26 Im mad at people yelling COCONUT OIL IS GOD for like all of 2016-17  and those same ppl now saying it's poison  coulda just told me its different for everyone before I wasted my time andbmskdkks
1669 2018-01-23 20:46:21 He could care less about them. His money is in coal, oil and gas anyway. Only done to help them out the more.  Plus he probably made a deal with China for help with North Korea. Making US made solar panels never gonna happen still cheaper to import w/tariff. #SAD
1670 2018-01-23 20:46:11 Working in the oil field, the last thing you want to hear is 8 hour days that’s wack.
1671 2018-01-23 20:45:58 This I feel is down to shortages of oil and been controlled by the east that supply it. This isn’t for the better of the world ie emissions and air quality, its purely down to oil resources and money
1672 2018-01-23 20:45:47 Get off drugs,chill with the alcohol,stop eating meat n processed trash. Get off of prescription medications.Let your immune system do what it's supposed to.Take care of your body n it will take care of you.Then get you some good cannabis oil n some shroomies n level up mentally
1673 2018-01-23 20:45:42 Sylvester Stallone says:
Jan 9, 2018 - "With Obama we had a snake oil salesman, a total actor, working against our interests.” 
Stallone warned, during 2010 midterms, about Obama's deceitful nature, declaring Obama a “Manchurian candidate” placed in power by the New World Order.
1674 2018-01-23 20:45:35 I feel like when ever I take my car in for an oil change they always find more problems 
1675 2018-01-23 20:45:17 Cinnamon ground
Honey
Banana
Olive oil
All mixed, definitely will give you strong healthy hair.
1676 2018-01-23 20:45:14 Fried in old oil fucking gross man
1677 2018-01-23 20:45:12 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1678 2018-01-23 20:44:46 Slice in half. Olive oil, salt, pepper, 425F oven until browned and delicious. Splash with balsamic vinegar and parmesan before serving.
1679 2018-01-23 20:44:24 whats going to happen with the middle east once oil runs out
1680 2018-01-23 20:44:22 You can add it to Baked Beans, or mix it with Balsamic and Olive Oil for a salad dressing x
1681 2018-01-23 20:44:18 Gettting this oil change. Business must be handled. Next, recenter the plan
1682 2018-01-23 20:44:10 @BMW_UK I’m havin to top up my M3  with 1L@engine oil every 3 days. I took the car to my local garage and even they can’t fix the problem. Bmw- never buying one ever ever AGAIN. My local garage says it’s a known issue which I think you lot should already have solution. Not happy
1683 2018-01-23 20:44:09 Perhaps oil and coal handout
1684 2018-01-23 20:44:08 Yes, blame the black president for George Bush's recession. Bush cut taxes on the rich & started two wars, which destabilize middle east & doubled oil prices. Obama borrowed money just to kick start the economy again. His economy & employment still going like gang busters today
1685 2018-01-23 20:44:06 Oil change time. Oops.
1686 2018-01-23 20:44:01 Halve them, toss in oil of your choice with granulated garlic & seasoned salt & roast them at 425° until they are caramelized. Noms!
1687 2018-01-23 20:43:57 This is honestly insane. there is no reason for all these waters to be opened up.  So if they find oil and gas in the great lakes will they be 'open for business' too?   
1688 2018-01-23 20:43:45 Many potential disasters, perhaps like the potential disaster you signed off on? When the Arctic has an oil spill you will be remembered as a champion of one thing: Destruction of the planet for profit.
1689 2018-01-23 20:43:44 I'm loving the facial oil serum! I have used it every night since I first received it. I must take some photos for instagram (now my uni exams are over!). Thank you once again.
1690 2018-01-23 20:43:40 
1691 2018-01-23 20:43:34 Solar and wind energy, not coal and oil! That fuels progressives!
1692 2018-01-23 20:43:34 Coconut oil bby girl
1693 2018-01-23 20:43:32 While we continue to maintain a carrier group at all times in the Persian Gulf to protect oil cargo mostly heading to Asia.
1694 2018-01-23 20:43:17 my idea of "self care" is pouring the whole bottle of oil into my diffuser & drink green tea, then assuming my life will surely piece back together magically.
1695 2018-01-23 20:43:16 Trump lied to farmers, blocking solar in favor of oil interests
1696 2018-01-23 20:43:11 Overstimulated Oscar Overcomes Oil
1697 2018-01-23 20:43:11 It might be the best experience you've ever had, BUT, I'mma tell you a less painful way: Oil up the butt
1698 2018-01-23 20:42:53 nothing really, i use shea moisture Jamaican black castor oil shampoo and the leave in conditioner and 100% coconut oil. That’s all.
1699 2018-01-23 20:42:47 It's not oil .
1700 2018-01-23 20:42:45 Sauté them with a bunch of garlic and olive oil and you'll be good. Don't steam them! Also CONGRATS ON THE NOM!

1702 2018-01-23 20:42:16 Lo único que no me cuadra, es que suban a la vez Euro/dólar, Oil y Oro, en todo casi si sube Oil suele subir Dólar y bajar oro y no está sucediendo, quizás por el doping en los mercados, no lo se, sería digno de estudio, cuantas veces han subido los tres a la vez.
1703 2018-01-23 20:42:08 Bill DeBlasio must think he can be President. He sues "Big Oil" & "Big Pharma" in less than a month.
1704 2018-01-23 20:42:06 Has Trump put a tariff on foreign steel? This is such a transparent move. He cares nothing about #MadeInUSA and everything about helping Big Oil.
1705 2018-01-23 20:42:05 There's a #SolarTarriff  put out by this regime. Solar power is CLEAN. But OIL is BIG.  Trying to raise some awareness here. And Why would I Leave My Home??
1706 2018-01-23 20:42:04 When hot oil splatters everywhere and you’re so happy you wear glasses.
1707 2018-01-23 20:42:03 McCain fries really are trash . They absorb so much of that oil .
1708 2018-01-23 20:41:48 bts has suffered so much hate and abuse from antis over the years and you’re out here giving those people oil to throw on a fire to tear bts down just delete your video oh my god be at least a tiny bit mature
1709 2018-01-23 20:41:44 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.
1710 2018-01-23 20:41:37 Have you tried invading a country for oil?
1711 2018-01-23 20:41:34 Might be a good business opportunity to re-brand some mustache wax and beard oil for the alt-right market.
1712 2018-01-23 20:41:28 The future ‘beyond oil’ world will value small towns surrounded by good farm land over the mega cities of Today .

1714 2018-01-23 20:40:51 Microwave your scrambled eggs because you don't have to use oil or butter to cook them and they come out real fluffy n stuff
1715 2018-01-23 20:40:38 Once again the WH oil baron signs self dealing legislation.
1716 2018-01-23 20:40:33 Solar employees more than coal and oil combined?!?! Yeah....right....
1717 2018-01-23 20:40:32 Because the media still refuse to acknowledge both Chelsea and City have got there on dirty oil money. Hope they’re also destroyed when the money runs out...
1718 2018-01-23 20:40:32 I've tried it and doesn't help much. I take massive doses of codliver oil and vit D3 but I have been slacking for a few weeks. I1m gonna get my shit together,  I need to keep awake for #TheExpanse S3! 
1719 2018-01-23 20:40:31 Open up the market. Make it easier and more cost-effective for individuals to utilize solar power. Do more to help wind and solar energy providers to compete with oil and gas. More industry competition = better, more affordable options for consumers.
1720 2018-01-23 20:40:29 Glad to see they're finally exposing canola oil

1724 2018-01-23 20:40:00 Complete BS Ben!! If you don’t want pipes for oil and gas, how do you heat your house and fuel the car I’m sure you drive. Are you honestly willing to change your lifestyle?? Your an idiot, but maybe you live in a tent, that powers the computer your using!!!
1725 2018-01-23 20:39:52 If One Finger Brought Oil - Things Fall Apart part Biafra24
1726 2018-01-23 20:39:48 Yeah, this is kinda why I didn't change careers last year after my solar training to go into solar design.  I knew this was coming...  I wouldn't be in any better shape if I was going into coal or oil, though...  It's just a thumb at the nose to Obama yet again.
1727 2018-01-23 20:39:31 I guess the good thing about spending part of your life on the wrong side of the tracks is you learn not to trust people.  You learn early there is no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow ... just an oil slick.
1728 2018-01-23 20:39:17 It's the RHI equivalent of an oil tank or a coal hopper lol
1729 2018-01-23 20:39:17 I think you’ll find that they’re pretty tasty if you roast them in the oven with a bit of olive oil, salt and an Oscar nomination.
1730 2018-01-23 20:39:15 Have a friend that uses CBD oil for his Parkinson’s. It helps him tremendously. I wish you well. 
1731 2018-01-23 20:38:45 I went to a Russian oil company event like this around 2008. It was mind boggling.
1732 2018-01-23 20:38:37 @thesheetztweetz Big deal on Disney bonus. Plenty of oil but rising gas prices will take that away. Big deal
1733 2018-01-23 20:38:37 Yes, sound advice #indiehour
1734 2018-01-23 20:38:29 Ok so I was v stressed and out and put lavender oil on bc it relieves stress, and I spilled it on my shirt and in the end stressed me out bc it is stained on my favorite shirt

1736 2018-01-23 20:38:20 I thought I lifted baby oil to put on my face but I lifted ACETONE AND IM CRYING AND MY FACE IS BURNING
1737 2018-01-23 20:38:09 Doesn't mean there is recoverable oil in all of the blue shaded area, though.
1738 2018-01-23 20:38:02 Roasted garlic + Parmesan + Asiago + olive oil. Best spread.
1739 2018-01-23 20:38:02 There's more electrician jobs out there than electrical engineer jobs. I should know. I'm both.

OK lets say the NDP lost.... and then what? what is your end game? That doesn't change the economic situation which is heavily influenced by the price of oil, and where we can sell it
1740 2018-01-23 20:38:00 Though worth noting that's about 12,000 jobs over ten years, on par with bakers, flight attendants, and.....oil and gas roustabouts.
1741 2018-01-23 20:37:57 Ask the 23,000 people that will lose their jobs in 2018 alone, that work in the solar industry.  They employ more than coal, oil, and steel put together.
1742 2018-01-23 20:37:56 Five dead, more than ten others injured after an oil tanker fell on a Tuk Tuk full of passengers at Kachok in Kisumu | #NewsGuru
1743 2018-01-23 20:37:49 Agreed. The amount of salt, sugar and oil we use in our dishes is overwhelming. An extra 5 pounds of fat can be detrimental to long term health. Simple diet changes & exercise are key for neurological & physiological well being!
1744 2018-01-23 20:36:59 Tbh not watching it hate everything about that oil club all manufactured and you’re fans are shit .. do they only know one song blue moon ???
1745 2018-01-23 20:36:53 Oil ruins the environment, health and is the cause of climate change. Local decision making has weight with proposed oil.
1746 2018-01-23 20:36:30 Of course he wants that, d..kless donnie has to hurt himself out for big oil
1747 2018-01-23 20:36:28 寝まーす。
1748 2018-01-23 20:36:22 Yes. Endorse. A little oil, toss with garlic, cut in quarters, roast till nutty and slightly browned. SO GOOD
(And well-deserved, on both the Brussels and nomination)
1749 2018-01-23 20:36:17 That’s one of the reasons Fenty had such a drastic dry down color change but is a silicone/oil based foundation. A ton of pigment. Left with pigment, silicone derivatives etc.
1750 2018-01-23 20:36:13 Oil

1753 2018-01-23 20:35:59 Not read the book, but agree we need to snap the dependency cord with foreign oil - however, I firmly believe we need to get away from fossil fuels, gases, etc and aim for more and better ways to utilize clean renewable solar energy
1754 2018-01-23 20:35:44 I'M SURE THEY WOULD DO BETTER ON SOLAR PANELS INSTEAD OF POLLUTING THE AIR WITH OIL PRODUCTS, AND CO2.
1755 2018-01-23 20:35:36 I literally just made this same decision and here I am getting my oil changed  sometimes you just gotta do the right thing
1756 2018-01-23 20:35:34 inject coconut oil into your heart. fucking. jam it in there. fuck. fucking. bathe in it. stick your face in it. fucking. coconut oil RAW

1758 2018-01-23 20:35:24 Now, US$ is no longer the reserve currency.

And China wants its yuan to supplant US$ for all trade—not just oil.

Recently China has been doing extreme military exercises & signed an agreement with Pakistan to trade only in yuan—not US$. (China will do this with all countries.)

1776 2018-01-23 20:33:59 Since we know Trump is in the pockets of oil and coal aka @kochinstitute @Koch_Industries @kochie_online this is no surprise.
1777 2018-01-23 20:33:58 The arguments used by wind energy boosters against local decision  making are now also being used by oil companies like Kinder Morgan against local  decision making in Burnaby.

1793 2018-01-23 20:32:19 Interesting that cooking with oil seems to have been odd enough then that “salad oil” was the usual term. “It’s meant for salads but be daring and actually cook with it!”

Wonder what they normally used. Lard? No fat at all? I plead ignorance.

1797 2018-01-23 20:31:48 My hair tangles a lot too. I’ve been doing the the hot oil treatment because It helps me a lot with detangling also when I put the deep conditioner I usually finger detangle then once it’s all washed out I use the denmen brush which is like a tangle teaser but better to me.
1798 2018-01-23 20:31:44 Just placed a tariff on solar imports, I don't care that the solar industry employs more people than the coal or oil,... I am prepared to make 23000 solar employees unemployed each year, just to make me feel good that I have done something for the dying coal industry.

1800 2018-01-23 20:31:39 During Great Recession, China got currency-swap agreements w/ every country.

At least twice, China tested our reaction to threats that China & allies would dump US$ & debt. 

Obama countered by opening Strategic Petroleum Reserve, so countries needed US$ to buy the cheap oil.

1802 2018-01-23 20:31:27 @GrandCentralSEA I noticed your bakery at Eastlake Ave using the same grill to toast both the bacon and sandwiches. Please take into consideration vege customers who do not like to have their sandwiches mixed with the oil coming from the bacon.
1803 2018-01-23 20:31:26 Oil drilling so good for the environment and so safe.  NOT  I wonder what will be said when toxic water shows up because of Fracking?
1804 2018-01-23 20:31:20 He is helping his "own" coal and oil barons who have him in their deep pockets! Environmental scientists cannot persuade him (most likely can't even pronounce such big words) - so here we are America! Make America Trump and Penceless Again!
1805 2018-01-23 20:31:00 Do you envision the people employed by Solar would be put to better use employed elsewhere in the energy industry? If so, where and why? Does coal or oil need more people to increase output? Solar clearly does right now, but I would consider that an investment
1806 2018-01-23 20:30:59 I may be wrong, but I get no pleasure in seeing people losing money.
For all those short #crude, remember Occam's razor when explaining the rise in crude.
It is the market BELATEDLY recognizing a shift in underlying oil commodity fundamentals, not speculation. 
IMO.

1807 2018-01-23 20:30:43 No doubt another handout to the petroleum lobby. Green energy produces more domestic employment per megawatt hour (and drastically less carbon) than oil by far.

1809 2018-01-23 20:30:11 Just cut them in half, toss in oil with salt and pepper, then roast them cut side down at 500° until they look like they're charred.
1810 2018-01-23 20:30:04 Yeah you don’t have control over the islands. Nothing Macri says or does can stop the British from drilling. The only thing preventing it is the cost of oil being low.

1813 2018-01-23 20:29:50 He's going to war with renewable energy in support of his energy buddies, big oil, natural gas, and coal. There are more jobs in renewable than there are in all the big three combined. This one is going to bite the job market in the ass.

1831 2018-01-23 20:28:13 War oil and gold - you are planning for the previous war as I tweet as a contingency to potential unpopularity - STOP Mr. President, let’s reduce the quantity of generals on your team - too mang is dangerous.  I do not feel secure with their influence.
1832 2018-01-23 20:28:04 It’s all in how they are cooked. Cut them in half & lay flat side down in frying pan. Drizzle light olive oil over and sauté for about 5 minutes until brown. Place in bowl and squeeze fresh lemon juice over them and sprinkle w/ salt. Enjoy. Truly thrilled with #TheBigSick nom!
1833 2018-01-23 20:27:59 The US had to be brought back to Iraq and Syria. ISIS was helped to capture massive territory in Iraq and Syria resulting in the US re-entry in Iraq and Syria to counter Russian nd Iranian influence  nd getting ther hands on Iraqi oil as Trump has stated.

1854 2018-01-23 20:26:15 My hair was too. I’ve been neglecting it all month. I’ve just been throwing it up in a bun with gel which just made it hard and gross but after my ACV rinse, hot oil treatment, and deep conditioner It’s back to normal lol.

1858 2018-01-23 20:26:07 Roads will also wear slower due to cars not being stopped at intersections as often dropping oil and fumes which destroy roads making it necessary to repair more often.

1865 2018-01-23 20:25:39 Even APEGA says their engineers are not the ones hurting. It's their 5000 geologists that can't find work. Engineers don't just work in oil and gas. They also travel for work and regularly work in other jurisdictions. Your number was made up... it simply was. why defend it?
1866 2018-01-23 20:25:35 Funds' record long position at the time peaked on July 31, 2007. The next day, Oil peaked at 78.70 and fell 13% over the next 15 days to a low 68.70 on Aug 21 before resuming its rally. DSI fell from 88 to 59. I'm expecting a similar PB this time around before higher again.

1875 2018-01-23 20:23:55 Congratulations! And I used to hate brussel sprouts too. But if you have them roasted in the oven with olive oil until the outer leaves are a bit carmelized, they are so incredibly good.

1883 2018-01-23 20:23:32 Steam them in the microwave for a few minutes and then either fry them on the stove or bake them tossed with oil and spices. Once the edges are a little blackened, they’re delicious. Especially with a dip or a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese
1884 2018-01-23 20:23:24 Ok...got some friend fish. Im happy. I don't fry food anymore. Don't even have cooking oil outside of olive or coconut in the house 
1885 2018-01-23 20:23:24 Cut 'em in half and put them in a bowl. Mix in olive oil and a generous amount of salt, pepper, and crushed garlic. Spread on a baking sheet and roast 'em at 375° for 25 minutes. Sprinkle w/parm or lemon rind, or you can add crushed bacon. It'll change everything.
1886 2018-01-23 20:23:09 I wasn't looking forward to getting my oil changed but I walked in and fixed upper is on the tv so it's okay I guess

1890 2018-01-23 20:22:58 Just don’t eat boiled sprouts. They’re nasty. Get a pan nice and hot, add some sesame oil, shallots, and hoisin. All set!
1891 2018-01-23 20:22:55 He’s a moron.  If it keeps a false economic growth number going it’s great. Oil and gas aren’t renewable so it’s a continuous monetary stream. Solar and wind the opposite. Nothing he does is well thought, but that’s all his base needs!  It’s a tariff YEAH!!!

1917 2018-01-23 20:20:40 The entire domestic oil industry is dependent on government handouts. By this logic they should be cut off? Further, most red states take in more in federal dollars than they pay. In effect red states are "welfare" states subsidized by blue states. Should that stop as well?
1918 2018-01-23 20:20:36 And not a single mention of the underlying driver in price increase  - A fundamental material change in global oil stocks.  The very same driver that created the price drop.  
Crude did not crater because of COT weighting, it cratered because of FUNDAMENTAL MARKET CONDITIONS.
1919 2018-01-23 20:20:24 Cut in half, spritz with oil, dash of salt, bake in oven for a while. If you haven't tried them this way its the road to take.

1921 2018-01-23 20:20:14 #Trump's duties on solar cells are a back-door way of trying to help oil companies, who are under fire for promoting fossil fuels which they knew would damage environment.

1925 2018-01-23 20:19:54 I read this morning about Trump putting a 30% tariff on solar panels in an attempt to kill the American solar industry.  Think about that for a moment.  Rather than embracing the future with renewable energy the idiot is trying to prop up the oil and coal industries.

1936 2018-01-23 20:18:25 It's an arrow made of pasta. The head is a sharpened ravioli. It injects tainted olive oil in you that makes you want to drive vespas.

1943 2018-01-23 20:17:50 THAT'S FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE KOCH BROTHERS AND BIG OIL!!! THAT'S WHY TILLERSON IS SOS, TOO!!!
1944 2018-01-23 20:17:40 Climate change, (writing about it/ local activism) I see it as resisting oil- in a way related to Americas war machine. My concience needs to resist both- thats my intention.
1945 2018-01-23 20:17:33 The only thing that makes it potentially not vegan is palm oil but that’s about people’s own morals as palm oil is technically vegan it just isn’t cruelty free
1946 2018-01-23 20:17:30 Hedging swaps by producers, based on real oil, not paper bets.  Know your COT!
1947 2018-01-23 20:17:27 No we went to Iraq to free there people from an oppressive regime the oil was just a bonus and on top of that to this day we still get most of our oil from Saudi Arabia

1953 2018-01-23 20:16:41 We do not need dieticians tell us to eat real food. It's not a science it is just a corporate arm. DAA will never recover from that. My type1 diabetic husband has been greatly harmed by them and their high carb /hi veg oil diet over past decades. Same goes for AHA.
1954 2018-01-23 20:16:33 Spoken like a true Kool-Aid drinking soldier of liberalism.  Sweet oil and coal.  LOL.  I bet that oil has gotten you to work more than you can ever count, and that coal kept you warm at night.  #Hypocrite

1958 2018-01-23 20:15:55 Yes! Use a little baby oil and keep working it in there! Use only a few drops at a time.
1959 2018-01-23 20:15:55 I’m not a big veggie lover, but I could eat sweet potato until it’s coming out of my ears. Lovely roasted in the oven with a wee bit oil and salt.
1960 2018-01-23 20:15:42 I just rubbed coconut oil onto my scalp because it kept making flakes and it actually feels really good. Not sure if I should wash it off after a while or what? Bald friends what am I supposed to do?

It is still going looking at the maps and someone has fired up the Taranaki Oil generator as well
1968 2018-01-23 20:14:44 You don't really? Trump is in the pockets of big oil coal and Russia who's only commodity is oil. Who's selling oil to NKorea! Where are the sanctions on Russia??? #ImplementRussianSanctionsNow
1969 2018-01-23 20:14:42 Because wars that kill people and exploitative relationships that ship capital out of a nation, thus impoverishing it, are bad? Like are you literally in the mindset that things like the Iraq War were good because we took their oil? You are just a racist.
1970 2018-01-23 20:14:35 I like this coconut oil skin care routine im on and its been only a few days,cant wait to see results

I think I need beard oil
1973 2018-01-23 20:14:17 I’m not holding my breath on this until it’s done on a national level. They allow for medical oil and then gave a contract to a connected company to be the only producers and distributors.

1985 2018-01-23 20:12:53 Yes. Get rid of all these antiquated, carcinogenic 19th & 20th Century forms of energy that harm our health & environment. Our government must stop subsidizing oil & gas industries. Retrofitting all our buildings, homes, & power grid for renewables would create economic boom.
1986 2018-01-23 20:12:46 Wake up the sleeping Dollar. Miners, GLD, Oil all trying to get out of their pants. They need to be whipped

1991 2018-01-23 20:11:26 Something I find sad is when a good person needs help due to circumstances beyond his control, like trying to sell commissions his own beautiful oil paintings since he lost his job, the FIRST question people have been asking is...who did he vote for?
1992 2018-01-23 20:11:19 @yemialadee does your nose smell like hot oil
1993 2018-01-23 20:11:15 Shorting Oil, winter 2017/18 = school of life.
1994 2018-01-23 20:11:13 Well the snow and ice has melted. So it’s time to blow up the tyres and oil the chain on the old pedal bike!! Try shift this Christmas timber!! 
1995 2018-01-23 20:11:12 I really wish I can go back to time to the Battle of Carthage with an A-10 Warthog. After I mowed down untold amounts of mercenary soldiers, I would step out of my golden plane, my naked body covered in gold paint and oil. Then I would order Caesar to suck my dick
1996 2018-01-23 20:11:08 WOW! Your communist city is looking 4 money and suing everyone huh? First oil companies now pharma companies. Dum Dum, it's NOT a opioid crisis, it is an over dose crisis. Why not clarify that most of the abuse of prescription pain pills is not by those 4 whom they’re prescribed?
1997 2018-01-23 20:11:06 I use the pumpkin glycolic mask from Andalou naturals to get rid of mine! vitamin e oil has also helped

2006 2018-01-23 20:10:23 Pretty much. Probably also a lot of oil industry lobbying.
2007 2018-01-23 20:10:23 Lol PKK/YPG whatever, they can not beat shit without help from USA and even with help we will crush them. This time u are in big trouble, EU, Russia, Iran... everybody is watching to see how u will try to negotiate out of this. Say goodbye to Syrian oil:)
2008 2018-01-23 20:10:17 Yes journalists just lap it

We read the same things   nuclear will always be expensive wind turbines have always been cheap the price of oil and gas won't rise.

2011 2018-01-23 20:10:07 And we have basically $0 in the bank to show for it. We have spent every single dollar that came from the oil sands. We may have all the sprawl and cities that came with the booms but none of the wealth ever lasted long term.
2012 2018-01-23 20:10:06 The initial estimates for permanent jobs was under 50. Additionally, since the oil was canadian, it was only to be sold to foreign buyers & could not be sold to US. Opposition was ecological & to retain sovereign rights over the trail. Trump propaganda over estimates jobs.
2013 2018-01-23 20:10:06 I simply adore Crème Of The Crop hand and body cream! No perfumes or dyes and made from the highest quality African Shea butter and Safflower Seed oil.

2018 2018-01-23 20:09:34 Dr. Jude is definitely trying, but failing miserably. Do quinoa and palm oil issues justify the dairy industry somehow? Just wondering how, if that is in fact true....envt'l issues, water use, land use, antibiotic resistance, murder of calves, need I go on?
2019 2018-01-23 20:09:32 Is BP oil hiring

2023 2018-01-23 20:09:17 I’m irritated as FUCK my pants got oil all over them. 
2024 2018-01-23 20:09:16 There’s no need to be rude I’m aware you can read but the majority of vegans will eat them as they don’t CONTAIN milk. Everything we eat has the potential to be cross contaminated unless it’s a fully vegan company and warehouse. The main issue is palm oil if anything
2025 2018-01-23 20:09:08 @masikakalysha @kkwbeauty help her out with that amazing oil
2026 2018-01-23 20:08:48 Only makes sense if a lot of your pals are oil men.
2027 2018-01-23 20:08:47 I love how this attack against renewable energy is being viewed as a great thing by republicans... it really shows the degree in which they misunderstand the harm the oil companies have caused as well as climate change.

2030 2018-01-23 20:08:17 Why does this remind me of baby oil
2031 2018-01-23 20:08:14 Not necessarily. E.g. Middle East poverty has massively reduced in the last 50 years and in the countries where it has happened it is mainly down to State owned Oil Wealth.

2035 2018-01-23 20:07:50 i wish i understood economics bc i just had to sit thru a presentation about oil n gas and the guy made capitalism sound so good but i KNOW there was a spin im just too dumb to recognize
2036 2018-01-23 20:07:39 Chiiiiile I get a damn chill everytime I pull up to get an oil change
2037 2018-01-23 20:07:37 Qatar intelligence channeled money through their agent Mr. Fahad Yasin. @M_Farmaajo brought presidency with that money. And he appointed you. Hence, a courtesy visit to the Qatar state minister for foreign affairs is a must; no surprise there. Soma Oil next?

2038 2018-01-23 20:07:36 Cars are so expensive (bro it's just an oil change) 
2039 2018-01-23 20:07:26 We`ll see who`s oil it is when you lot try to keep it,sad that scots need EU to protect against our warmongering union "partners"
2040 2018-01-23 20:07:21 As well as painkillers, oil of cloves works wonders.  And press something warm to your face.
2041 2018-01-23 20:07:12 I bought my shea from Ghana, it arrived hard. I heated & whipped it with Vitamin E oil, aloe vera, and cocoa butter, but it just gets hard again. I’m going to try avocado oil, another Twitter friend recommended it  Which lotion brand are you mixing it with?
2042 2018-01-23 20:07:04 Never thought I’d say this but fuck coconut oil. 
Avocado oil >>>>>
2043 2018-01-23 20:07:02 Oil breaks thru oils in your face - I say go for it and try  at least I have oily face and I use oils (only at night tho lol) and nothing bad has happened - my fav is plain old coconut oil!
2044 2018-01-23 20:06:36 Comment of the day
 Sanchez compared playing for City to working on an oil rig. The money was fucking brilliant but theres hardly any fucker there...
2045 2018-01-23 20:06:24 You don’t think Trump putting a 30% tariff on solar panels isn’t a protection for the fossil fuel industry? Solar employs more people than coal, oil & gas combined. That is not creating jobs, jobs, jobs as Trump claims he does.
2046 2018-01-23 20:06:14 Keep up the good work. BTW , DT's federal offshore drilling policy reopens both Hermosa Beach AND Redondo Beach (CA State tidelands area) to oil drilling due to obscure 'drainage' provision in CA Coastal Sanctuary Act @tedlieu @Nanette4CA #Morley
2047 2018-01-23 20:06:09 Trump’s infrastructure plan:
Incentivizes, encourages and relies on privatization. 
Provides NO dedicated funds for public water projects. 
Paid for by offshore oil drilling and fracking in national parks!
@foodandwater
2048 2018-01-23 20:06:06 I hate the oil mines becoming desperate cause all these ruffled apes love the opposite negative impact like breaking bones that keep on breaking.
2049 2018-01-23 20:06:04 #EginaFPSO This is one project that would create many jobs in the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry. Big up to @TOTALNigeria and @officialncdmb
2050 2018-01-23 20:05:56 Trump imposed a 30% tariff on solar panels, virtually killing the solar industry. Solar employs more people than coal and oil combined. A loss of 23,000 jobs is at stake.
2051 2018-01-23 20:05:53 The world powers are really disgusting to have seen what genocide are being carried out on Biafrans and still keep silence for oil that is not theirs,they are the real shithole@radiobiafralive

2055 2018-01-23 20:05:11 So let me get this straight,you are telling an oil rich nation,that your Nation fought tooth and nail to keep in union,that they are skint.Scots food and drink exports in 2016 were 5.5 billion,,just food and drink.England soon will be a country again,standing on its own two feet
2056 2018-01-23 20:05:09 Coconut oil and bicarbonate of soda
2057 2018-01-23 20:05:08 This isn’t about cheap Chinese solar panels, it’s about the solar panels themselves. Oil baby! What about the flooded tie market with cheap Chinese ties?

2059 2018-01-23 20:04:47 CBD oil is working wonders for epileptics in the states and it’s all natural. Surely we need to get this legalised instead of filling out bodies with medicine that has side effects. It just doesn’t make sense when theirs natural sources out there!

2061 2018-01-23 20:04:43 Eminent domain is always good when you're building oil pipelines and border walls. Also golf courses and sports arenas.
2062 2018-01-23 20:04:33 TLE at Wal-Mart ain’t good for shit, but tires. Y’all not changing my oil anymore Cuh’n .
2063 2018-01-23 20:04:30 But..no.  When demand for solar panels decreases because we the people don't have enough spending cash to afford them, jobs are lost.  It isn't rocket science. Meanwhile, in China, they are developing solar highways.  We're mucking around in coal and oil.
2064 2018-01-23 20:04:30 Professor: I don't know if you guys remember, but the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, I believe it was April of 2010, that might have been before your time
Me: how old do you think I am
2065 2018-01-23 20:04:17 Depends how much the Americans flood the market with oil
2066 2018-01-23 20:04:16 Our Essential 7 Oil can be used for the LOC method to help seal in moisture or to apply to your twists when taking them down to add shine and prevent frizz!
2067 2018-01-23 20:04:14 This coming from the son of the guy that runs arms, oil, investment companies.
If not worse drugs, like they did in the opium wars.
Charles doesn't want to be King. He's happy running these companies.

2069 2018-01-23 20:04:12 My yacht is like the Chevy of the seas. It's a rather humble craft for being 150 feet long with a full crew. I do the oil changes myself. #workingclass
2070 2018-01-23 20:04:07 ummm yes it is? Iraq and Iraqi Kurdistan still have full control over their oil.
2071 2018-01-23 20:04:06 Look buddy,
He has NO interest in the tech world whatsoever PERIOD.
OIL and COAL jobs are NOT growing yet he sacrifices the Grand Canyon as if it is. 

And for the record Trump FAILED at running a casino WHO DOES THAT!?

He's not a genius even in the least so PLEASE stop the BS

2074 2018-01-23 20:03:40 Correct.  In medieval times was common to follow up with Moats, Archers and vats of boiling oil.

2075 2018-01-23 20:03:38 I saw Nixon resign & learned our government lies to us with the Pentagon Papers. I've seen the Universe go from "infinite" to "finite," Earth from forever to doomed. The Berlin Wall came down & the Cold War ended; USSR dissolved; Capitalism turned into Oligarchy & Oil is King.

2077 2018-01-23 20:03:32 Our Essential 7 oil is infused with Coconut Oil, Olive Oil, Jojoba Oil and Sweet Almond Oil to lock in moisture, help protect from breakage and soften the hair.
2078 2018-01-23 20:03:31 I been an Avon rep for awhile now And I have tried the product they send me the skin so soft bath oil product I noticed that it is getting rid of my strechmarks And the skin so soft lotions is good any ones dry areas. Sincerely V Colter
2079 2018-01-23 20:03:27 That's because Trump is a vile human being with zero redeeming qualities. He has exactly one talent: world's best snake oil salesman.
2080 2018-01-23 20:03:24 Tillerson being from Exxon would likely be a voice in Trumps ear on this, out of all the Industries in America, he puts tariffs on the one that competes with Oil, Gas & Coal. American jobs are huge in the install of these panels. What about the freedom to be energy independent
2081 2018-01-23 20:03:20 At least then it was their oil, it isn't now.
2082 2018-01-23 20:03:14 Yes! Essential 7 Oil is great for hot oil treatments and all hair types as it helps to strengthen and prevent dry, brittle hair.
2083 2018-01-23 20:03:09 A detailed plan with no idea what they were going to use as a currency? And a number for the price of oil with no source or explanation (and 4 times higher than the real one)? I don't think so - and neither did the Scottish people.
2084 2018-01-23 20:02:56 Theists....  "As long, as I don't have to think for myself,  I believe this snake oil priest!  It's convenient and - HE's on TV! and HE has a Rolls Royce!!  There MUST be something special!"  
2085 2018-01-23 20:02:47 Had a fry up for dinner (no extra added oil or baked beans) and i regret nothing 
2086 2018-01-23 20:02:27 A Tariff on Solar Panels?? WHY? Trump, and Ivanka products are built in China. This is more about stifling solar, for big oil, than concern for US products.
2087 2018-01-23 20:02:20 Most Ool fans are supporters as opposed to the whining complaining few who seem to have the louder voices.  Being loud does not make you correct.
Go OIL Go!

2093 2018-01-23 20:01:41 Don't forget fabrics, too. Without oil, we'd soon run out of wool, cotton, and flax ... next thing you know, "I see nekkid people!".

2112 2018-01-23 19:59:55 The thing IMHO, is that oil quite recently broke out of major RSI resistance. That signaled a strong leg up was about to start (as we have seen). Personally I'm not interested at all in shorting oil before the same indicators signal that the trend has changed.
2113 2018-01-23 19:59:50 So Rejected club moaned about wage structures.

2117 2018-01-23 19:59:27 I doubt that, but it wouldnt be a bad reason. Do you think Saddam Hussein and his crime family should be in sole possession of the worlds 5th largest oil reserves?

2122 2018-01-23 19:58:37 Yesterday's AADE General Meeting, held at the Petroleum Club of Lafayette, featured a great presentation by Don Briggs, President of the Louisiana Oil and Gas Association, regarding important issues facing the Louisiana oil and gas industry.

2126 2018-01-23 19:58:08 Getting the car oil changed, and I’m trapped in the waiting room with hardcore Christian pop music.
2127 2018-01-23 19:58:06 Why isn’t America producing these?  ;o). If US economy showed profit from solar & other forms of sustainable energy, wouldn’t that change the momentum of the oil diggers?
2128 2018-01-23 19:57:57 Saddam Hussein murdered his own people in 1988, took us 15 yrs & fake evidence of WMD to suddenly give a toss. It was for oil, nothing more.

2145 2018-01-23 19:55:43 Daily reminder that coconut oil is a sealer, not a moisturizer. Rose hip, grape seed, jojoba and argan oil soaks into dry skin better.
2146 2018-01-23 19:55:42 Far from typical. You can ask my aunt who had palm oil and was sent back last night, and my cousin who was detained for three days because he had egusi seeds.

2170 2018-01-23 19:51:58 Tariffs on solar panels will hurt that industry and its workers and are designed to promote Trump and friends oil and gas interests. How about a tariff on all the stuff Trump and Ivanka produce in Asia. #economy #solar #cleanenergy

2190 2018-01-23 19:49:37 When that didn't take hold the energy companies began the myth that animals caused climate change. People knew this was lie & also dismissed this as idiotic attempt by big oil/gas/coal companies to divert blame from themselves.
2191 2018-01-23 19:49:28 Are you deep frying or oven cooking? Best way is to fry and coat them in a batter first. Something simple. Flour, water and a bit of paprika works wonders. Hot oil too.

2193 2018-01-23 19:49:21 It is like damn itchy and nice when you scratch kan? Nnt keluar stretch mark tau! Gosok2 je jgn pki kuku garuk. I also have on my 2nd tri, garok2 smpi perut tak lawa. Regret for scratching  Bio oil helps me abit from the itchy. Tmr I send you the picture.
2194 2018-01-23 19:49:16 The markets will not pay more for heavy crude from Canada unless the demand for Sweet Oil goes down. It’s not logistics it’s the product. (Mostly)

2200 2018-01-23 19:48:39 Mexico is about 70 billion less than Can trade wise,  plus the US run a defecitve of about 50 billion. Also most of your oil comes from Canada.
2201 2018-01-23 19:48:36 With trump we've regressed 50 years!  Rick Perry head of energy (oil man from TX) this is what we can expect.  Can't wait till trump is history.
2202 2018-01-23 19:48:33 Crude oil as a resource is the reason why Nigeria as a nation hasn't progressed past being a Third World country.
2203 2018-01-23 19:48:32 3 drops in morning coffee cuts pain drastically.CBD oil does not make you high. Dog has seizures. 3 drops under tongue seizure stops in less then 30 seconds.Sleeps several hours/normal post seizure behavior.
2204 2018-01-23 19:48:18 Every time I come get my oil change they put my car in the air & check shit that don't need to be checked 
2205 2018-01-23 19:48:10 Zulu and English..= water&Oil 
2206 2018-01-23 19:48:07 finna go get this oil change
2207 2018-01-23 19:48:07 Great for the oil corp polluters, horrendous for our planet and our health
2208 2018-01-23 19:47:55 Whomever decided to ram my ambulance from behind & then drive off, that trail of black oil leaking from your vehicle means you didn’t get far. #karma  We are all okay & you barely put a dent in Betty #dontmesswithmytruck #morningmadness
2209 2018-01-23 19:47:36 Why oil companies instead of coal companies? Deeper pockets I guess.
2210 2018-01-23 19:47:18 @USACEHQ Hi, thanks for the work in Puerto Rico. I want to know if you have the plan of the work for Dorado and Toa Alta. I live in Haciendas del Dorado and I want to know if you are in my area soon. I need to prepare my gas and oil budget.
2211 2018-01-23 19:46:58 My car is about to hit 100k soon. Might celebrate by doing something wild like getting the oil changed or something
2212 2018-01-23 19:46:57 .@doctorow we need a tariff on imported oil, gas and coal.
2213 2018-01-23 19:46:53 #dotardinchief is pandering to big oil and coal. This move would cost about 23k jobs to the solar industry.
2214 2018-01-23 19:46:44 I don't think there is a player that can reject the oil money
2215 2018-01-23 19:46:44 We can't invest if we don't have the revenue. We have to fix the core issue and that is the oil tax. They would rather live on savings.
2216 2018-01-23 19:46:38 The optics are: what is bad for solar is good for coal and oil and gas.
2217 2018-01-23 19:46:25 Oh fuck yeah!! Maybe with a bit of baby oil too

2220 2018-01-23 19:45:45 Never thought the engine would malfunction... maybe I shouldn’t have put in that olive oil.
2221 2018-01-23 19:45:42 What do you do If your friend carry palm oil while you're wearing white attire
2222 2018-01-23 19:45:41 Something terrible will happen and oil is not the future.
2223 2018-01-23 19:45:22 I bought this leave in conditioner at Walmart and my hair feels so moisturized...it worked incredibly with the castor oil I’ve been using.

2225 2018-01-23 19:45:12 No. Well now i think of it smells like soap :p 
But depends on how long the beard is. If its very long then there is a separate shampoo and oil for it
2226 2018-01-23 19:45:07 @realDonaldTrump As a solar company, we are devastated to learn Trump has imposed a 30% tariff on solar panels virtually killing the solar industry. Solar employs more people than coal & oil combined. today's decision will cause the loss of roughly 23,000 American jobs this year.
2227 2018-01-23 19:44:58 why dont you ask the trump family when they will be bringing their business back to the US.
Wake up you have been conned by this carpetbagger- snake oil salesman.

2229 2018-01-23 19:44:41 I can answer that. By negotiating. Something Obama was very familiar with. And something that the so-called “Great Negotiator” knows squat about. He’s just a snake oil salesman that doesn’t like to do the work.
2230 2018-01-23 19:44:41 never forget what the #ExxonValdez oil spill did to seabirds
2231 2018-01-23 19:44:38 Reduce oil......
2232 2018-01-23 19:44:32 Overall from economist: faster national GDP growth, CO is going to grow at slower rate but remain a top 10 state, interest rates might affect already high home costs, and higher commodity prices will help out Weld’s ag and oil and gas industries

2240 2018-01-23 19:43:26 And also on his rescinding of his offer of "funds" for

2246 2018-01-23 19:43:14 But we need oil! And our weapon producers need their profits as well. All that Government-staff in front of that is a picture anyway.

2295 2018-01-23 19:35:38 What did the scientists tell you about oil spills for the health of our oceans? That it's tax payers responsibility? More taxes for us and more profits for the Saudi oil barons you protect/serve.

2307 2018-01-23 19:34:14 In too many instances, when Americans and Europeans intervene to help impoverished nations there's an ulterior motive such as "resource development" (enslaving the indigenous people, stealing oil, gold, diamonds, etc.) or proselytizing the locals.

Have you heard of anyone having problems with heating oil jelling?
2335 2018-01-23 19:31:41 How about Americans? I'm anti big oil, for sure. How about we open all the factories that are boarded up now, put folks to work putting in a renewable infrastructure?
2336 2018-01-23 19:31:38 Money talks. The oil industry is part of the swamp. He's killing the environment.
2337 2018-01-23 19:31:27 Of course she wants to put tariffs on solar panels This has to be fought because otherwise he leaves everybody in the Dark Ages with oil and coal don't allow your country to become a third world country
2338 2018-01-23 19:31:27 Also I KNOW my skin is looks dry as fuck I’m out of my oil and it won’t be delivered until tomorrow (which means I’ll get it in 2 days bc campus post office)
2339 2018-01-23 19:31:25 He must support his big donor base which happens to be big oil and the power company
2340 2018-01-23 19:31:25 Democracy of the United States has destroyed millions of people around the world.
Destroyed for nothing!
Oil, markets, resources, provocation to war (Vietnam) ... is not the reason.
2341 2018-01-23 19:31:22 So it smells like vanilla and baby oil?
2342 2018-01-23 19:31:20 dead serious , if you tell me anything about usual coconut oil on your skin , just bye .
2343 2018-01-23 19:31:03 Yip that does make it worse but I understand . Try putting some tea tree oil on it after you wash your face . Hopefully won't get worse.
2344 2018-01-23 19:30:58 He doesn't understand science. He gets money from Russian oil.
2345 2018-01-23 19:30:57 Yallllll lmao this man Chris said I still got mileage left on my pussy. I don’t need an oil change yet 
2346 2018-01-23 19:30:50 There are some parallels, whether justified or not. For sure the return was very different, for all those assets they harvested, Avs only got 1 roster player right away, a 3rd pairing defender.
2347 2018-01-23 19:30:41 This dude at the register seriously tried to tell me they weren’t slow today. I “kindly” told him he must be blind if he things going on an hour and 30 is fast for an oil change.
2348 2018-01-23 19:30:35 A good #Provençal sauce contains olives, sundried tomatoes, pine nuts & fresh basil in olive oil & white balsalmic vinegar.
2349 2018-01-23 19:30:28 I am sure there was US political manipulation in getting Dilma Vana Rousseff dumped because she defied America re oil etc and was a starter of BRICS.
2350 2018-01-23 19:30:26 You have to oil the tan boots
2351 2018-01-23 19:30:24 Lol thank u paji castor oil best trust me, comes out THICCC with triple C’s
2352 2018-01-23 19:30:21 I forgot, the sun don’t shine in Jersey basements where heating oil is dumped. Out here we got plenty of sun to harvest and the wind always blows on the plains. America, she’s a big place.
Those w roof panels here have meters in reverse.

2354 2018-01-23 19:30:13 I went to the doc & they gave me some steroids cream & I use organic coconut oil morning & night.
2355 2018-01-23 19:30:12 What is oil plug thread size 2.8 Jeep  liberty thanks. Rock
2356 2018-01-23 19:30:06 I’m getting my oil changed and one of the owners of the shop complimented me on my jacket. He and I were wearing the same one.
2357 2018-01-23 19:29:59 No way could she have imagined when she went to interview him that he'd turn out to be a complete psycho--and probably a serial killer. They should oil him up and throw him into the most brutal prison imaginable.
2358 2018-01-23 19:29:57 Watch out for excess oil, if you use full fat coconut milk and cheap peanut butter it'll probs be too oily. So try and go for fancier PB or reduced coconut milk!
2359 2018-01-23 19:29:52 I had a 20 minute conversation with a 70 year old Native American & never broke eye contact. Genuine conversation, with no stigmas. His wisdom infected me..All because of a oil change.. The beauties of life.
2360 2018-01-23 19:29:51 Before he lies, does he bathe himself in baby oil or olive oil?
2361 2018-01-23 19:29:42 Let me get this straight. The #akleg is asking Alaskans to give up half of our PFDs and to give draws from our ERA account? Then you want to spend a bunch of money on an LNG line and other developments?

It's as if were a balance transfer to big oil. STOP.
2362 2018-01-23 19:29:37 What does big oil have a hand in this big industry?
2363 2018-01-23 19:29:16 Also, #RussiaSanctionsBill was to expand exports of US energy by foreign energy co in USA that’d invested $billions in export infrastructure since 2008.

Despite USA producing 10 M barrels of oil/day, we still import >7 M >expensive oil/day.

Exports up >200% oil & 300% nat gas.

2367 2018-01-23 19:29:07 As somebody who has frequent stomach problems, a little peppermint oil does wonders for claiming the stomach.
2368 2018-01-23 19:29:07 That took longer than I thought. The drain on the oil pan was so tight I had to use a dead blow hammer on the wrench to get it loose. I know it tightens up but that was stupid tight
2369 2018-01-23 19:29:03 Big Oil is just dirty.
2370 2018-01-23 19:29:01 Ever since they are ran by a oil rich country. Yes.
2371 2018-01-23 19:28:49 Pathetic city splashing dirty oil money  on new players again! Buying success I see!
2372 2018-01-23 19:28:47 He is a snake oil salesman. His product is his name. He IS good at it, and bad at everything else.
2373 2018-01-23 19:28:37 Love, Love, LOVE my Boscia Tsubaki Oil  just ordered my 2nd bottle  @bosciaskincare
2374 2018-01-23 19:28:28 Just ask oil daddy if you can spend more?
2375 2018-01-23 19:28:27 Trump support oil interests over American jobs created by solar industry
2376 2018-01-23 19:28:10 Kuwait is planning to increase production capacity of the oil sector from current levels of 3.2 mn. barrels per day to 4 mn. barrels per day by 2020. #OOTT #OPEC
2377 2018-01-23 19:28:06 Well done mate
2378 2018-01-23 19:27:32 In the process we create a few thousand jobs to pay income tax to help pay for the 10billion dollar dam that's creating discounted electricity for the investors LNG/Oil projects that are making them rich while we poison our watershed with fracking. Well really we poison Albertas.
2379 2018-01-23 19:27:25 oil dey your head boss....
2380 2018-01-23 19:27:22 Ridiculous.  Trump: “Let’s pollute as much as possible, and give the rich coal and oil industries a hand to get richer while the defile the earth.”
2381 2018-01-23 19:27:21 Bro coconut oil is trash
2382 2018-01-23 19:27:09 Glasgow of course! Where else? And don’t say Aberdeen. Those oil workers have little taste, they want volume!
2383 2018-01-23 19:26:39 I finally figured out what I want to do as a career.

I want to oil up black women for their photo shoots. I am ready.
2384 2018-01-23 19:26:36 Except my face is both acne prone and dry so I’m gonna use up the kiehls stuff then get badger face oil too. I can’t believe this works. And she got me a bentonite clay mask, which turns my face alarmingly red and completely rules
2385 2018-01-23 19:26:32 coconut oil clogs ur pores!!! dont use it as a moisturizer!!
2386 2018-01-23 19:26:19 I'm not blaming the oil. I'm Holistic. The universe is what the universe does methinks.
2387 2018-01-23 19:26:17 Does anybody realize Trump n his Ideas are archaich n taking the world backward? Yeah . Let continue to use coal n oil. Greenhouse effect, gobal warming, ozone layer. Thingz Trump has no concern.
2388 2018-01-23 19:26:14 I hear Norway is having serious problems, too. Having oil revenues sucks.
2389 2018-01-23 19:26:12 النائب مبارك الحريص: اشكر الاخوة النواب المستجوبين على الرقي في طرحهم بالاستجواب الا ان الاخت وزيرة الشئون استطاعت الرد على الاستجواب و ان كانت هناك اخطاء الا انها لا ترقى لمستوى طرح الثقة ولذلك اعلن عدم تأييدي لطلب طرح الثقة
2390 2018-01-23 19:26:04 I thought their cash was tied up in olive oil?
2391 2018-01-23 19:25:55 Many farmers benefit from solar technology, didn’t Trump recently say he supported autonomy of farmers...now he wants to make it more expensive for them. His love of oil  trump’s his love of the American farmer.
2392 2018-01-23 19:25:45 That's a mere 22 years away. Why are we building 50 to 100 year legacy oil infrastructure like pipelines?
2393 2018-01-23 19:25:44 China Solar panel tariff. What subsidies go to US mfg of solar panels? Push is for oil donors products. Oligarchy, US style.
2394 2018-01-23 19:25:35 They built it shitty so it will break so they can get paid to fix it again. Like the mechanic loosening your fan belt as he changes your oil
2395 2018-01-23 19:25:34 Yeah I don't disagree but his pigheadedness might mean we actually benefit from it longer-term. Plus it's not like we don't already subsidize renewable energies ( he knows he can't go after those, same with oil) I think in most cases subsidies are bad for markets
2396 2018-01-23 19:25:30 Rule of thumb in the international literature: for 'shale gas' or 'tight oil' read 'unconventional'.  Environmental, social, health, economic impacts will vary as you know depending on locale, ecosystem and type of geological structure being drilled.

2401 2018-01-23 19:24:58 Koch brothers have paid off the GOP/Trump with 100s million donations to get this: 30% tariffs on solar panels will absolutely tank the budding #cleanenergy industry, and will get rid of around 25k jobs in the process. Awful policy decision! Great for big coal ans oil.
2402 2018-01-23 19:24:48 @carbellorin This year marks 40yrs when engineers at Lagoven, one of Venezuela's 100%-owned oil operator back then, started an exploration programme on targets on the already mature Eastern Basin's northern flank. After 5yrs the giant El Furrial field was discovered.
2403 2018-01-23 19:24:38 Solar energy industries employ more people than coal and oil combined.

Fossil fuel usage is going down drastically world wide, and will continue to do so. It is a dying industry.

When @realDonaldTrump puts a 30% tariff on solar panels he is killing American jobs. #MAGA #Resist
2404 2018-01-23 19:23:59 I've never seen a pic of her in pants she didn't have to baby oil herself down to get in except at Zulu Ball.
2405 2018-01-23 19:23:47 thx for asking haha! I was washing my face with a clarisonic and first aid beauty red clay cleanser, then moisturizing with various kiehls stuff. But she turned me on to Badger (!!) sea buckthorn cleansing oil, which is fuckin wonderful and sorta obviates the need for moisturizer
2406 2018-01-23 19:23:45 Hey @realDonaldTrump , how much did big oil business pay you to tariff solar energy parts? You just added more to the swamp.
2407 2018-01-23 19:23:27 What about oil of oregano? I'm finding that works even better than echinacea. Can you research if there's any truth to that? Thanks

2412 2018-01-23 19:22:44 This must be the only way Trump knows how to make "friends", by rewarding his oil/coal friends with gifts. We need solar & wind technologies now!
2413 2018-01-23 19:22:31 Just got over a cold and used #GyaLabs lime essential oil in my diffuser every night. I felt like a champ every morning, and it made my room smell amazing 
2414 2018-01-23 19:22:29 Mix chickpeas, avocados, green peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, corn, and chia seeds all together and add olive oil as your salad and thank me later
2415 2018-01-23 19:22:21 You could be right. I do know the Avs were 8-6-0 at time of trade & are 19-10-3 since, so at minimum it didn't hurt them. But for sure it was a Big Move. 
Interesting comments by MacKinnon yesterday. He sure has emerged since that trade; coincidence? Terrific player for sure
2416 2018-01-23 19:22:20 NO BLOOD FOR OIL.
2417 2018-01-23 19:22:17 i'm just saying "it is possible to greatly reduce CO2 now", we just don't want to break a sweat. if we want to subsidize nukes, we can. and France ramped up super fast after the oil crisis in '74, so there's already a blueprint. this idea that we require better tech is nonsense.

2427 2018-01-23 19:21:18 To stay within the 2°C warming target (for which things are still Pretty Awful), the world's reserves of coal, oil and gas need to stay unburned. There is literally no future in fossil fuels, and the markets are beginning to realise this.
2428 2018-01-23 19:21:08 I wonder if any climate experts or geologists out there would dispute the factoid that there are 45 billion barrels of recoverable oil reserves in those waters. And 21mbod at today's prices.
2429 2018-01-23 19:21:02 I don’t do either of those things. I write technical specifications. They are exceptionally boring, unless you like oil and gas rotating machinery. Actually, they are boring even then. I just made a little fun of the influencer thing :) you might be, I have no idea.
2430 2018-01-23 19:20:57 Buddy has been fckkn up hard lately. Pretty sure hes an oil rigger who made bank in the $150 barrel days. Threw it all into the weed market, made a killing and now he is a (lucky) stock "God". If Hedge Fund legends go out of business what makes you think he can't / won't ? 
2431 2018-01-23 19:20:52 Yes, throwing oil on a fire is a great idea.
2432 2018-01-23 19:20:46 I have a fab painting by a local artist of one, she had seen one hunting off a branch over a stream and set up a stick to rest her camera on overlooking it, bloody bird landed on her stick, excellent oil painting resulted tho
2433 2018-01-23 19:20:27 I know I keep saying this. But summer 2018 is about to go down as one of the best summers ever. I just bought a new jar of coconut oil. I’m mf’n ready for you.

2436 2018-01-23 19:20:22 “Solar employs more people than coal and oil combined”. Solar produces *far* less energy than coal or oil. It’s small scale and inefficient of human labour.

2446 2018-01-23 19:18:52 Trump did it for his coal and oil buddies. Also he hates Obama so undo what obama did
2447 2018-01-23 19:18:45 How can we have crude oil nd we buying it expensively like we don't. What if we don't?
2448 2018-01-23 19:18:44 You mean in a bid to hamstring the solar energy industry to help oil and coal.

2471 2018-01-23 19:16:21 Economists are expecting oil and gas to stabilize this year. About $63 avg per barrel.
2472 2018-01-23 19:16:05 Surprised Trump hasn't been involved in importing Olive Oil. Oh wait, he probably was and it went bankrupt too!
2473 2018-01-23 19:15:59 Blame the oil.
2474 2018-01-23 19:15:39 SALEYO just put on Castor oil.. thank me later

2476 2018-01-23 19:15:32 WTF?? That's not for Americans, it's for BIG OIL!!!
2477 2018-01-23 19:15:21 Is this just a way to boost big oil and coal? Make solar more expensive deliberately so that all other energy businesses can try to bounce back.  Sabotaging one industry for another sounds a lot like the MO of 45.
2478 2018-01-23 19:15:19 Texas based supercomputing used for oil&gas.  Come see us in Houston Congressman.  We will help you out.
2479 2018-01-23 19:15:19 And for the record @DNC @BarackObama i would have voted for her if she promised to keep the oil in the ground. Why do you think you lost the House Senate and White House? Id love to know what you think. I think its cuz you dont stand for much but feel good say nothing platitudes.
2480 2018-01-23 19:14:53 Did not know that about soybean oil and skin damage.  If you are buying a processed food, chances are, it contains soybean oil.

2484 2018-01-23 19:14:18 Only use sugar tho. No sand, which would have the same effect. But sugar will burn and turn into a sticky black goo. Sort of like quickly burnt oil. So it isn't distinguishable from a normal engine blowing up.
2485 2018-01-23 19:14:16 I’ve been getting an oil change for an hour and 14 min.... wtf

2488 2018-01-23 19:14:02 Weld accounts for 90 percent of the state’s oil production. CO is 7th nationally. Natural gas production is also highest in state in Weld
2489 2018-01-23 19:13:28 Keihls midnight recovery oil !!! It helps
2490 2018-01-23 19:13:27 When people do stupid things, stupid problems are the outcome. Key word in the oil field COMMUNICATION, if something is bad fix it before it causes a even bigger issue and it can prevent someone for getting hurt. Just look at what happened on a rig in Oklahoma.

2492 2018-01-23 19:13:11 All I do for the burger is put a small amount of grilling salt on it and then cook it in a non stick pan with no oil for about 3 minutes on each side on medium heat. Put a slice of cheeze on the second side as soon as you flip it so it melts by the time the burger is done

2497 2018-01-23 19:12:25 I mean.. a political scam... AES and EcoElectrica currently generate (LP) at ~8 to 10¢ Kwh. They sell to PREPA at ~12-14¢kwh. PREPA  generates (heavy oil derivates) at ~14-18¢Kwh.. they sell at 19-21¢Kwh plus the all the surcharges = ~23-28¢Kwh.. nice deal...!!

2505 2018-01-23 19:11:38 It is time to get the @UCSUSA to agree to send a mission to poison the rich people's cocaine with dimethyl-mercury. 

I don't see another way out. The 1% will keep the oil flowing at all costs, destroy the planet with factory farms, and nuke countries that don't support them.

2508 2018-01-23 19:11:09 Tea Tree oil smells like lake / camp cabins. And I’m about it.
2509 2018-01-23 19:11:02 Spent my day off getting an oil change, calling my insurance company, going to the bank & running errands. If that’s not adulting I don’t know what is. 
2510 2018-01-23 19:10:59 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one

2526 2018-01-23 19:09:05 Trump promised tariffs in his campaign. He doesn’t care what tariffs. Someone said it should be solar +washing machines. The person that told him solar probably has either shorted solar stock or has stock in oil companies. Or, lastly it’s someone who owns an oil company..follow$
2527 2018-01-23 19:08:43 The World Growth narrative is kicking today. Lunacy once again.
2528 2018-01-23 19:08:43 save but for a few years of high priced oil wealth (& subsequent spending orgy by gov), this has always been our lot in life, only now it is accompanied by a demographic catastrophe and expensive mega project.
2529 2018-01-23 19:08:41 Everyone talking about RINs and #ethanol re: Philadelphia refinery #bankruptcy but worth discussing pipeline policy. PES had to import Bakken crude #Oil by rail. A much more expensive solution when you consider PES' size/capacity

That is literally how you kill a dog.

Dogs can't OD on leaf, but they sure can OD on oil.

2543 2018-01-23 19:07:16 DO NOT use synthetic oil. It has GMOs, and will give your car the artism.
2544 2018-01-23 19:07:11 I hope that @lisamurkowski knows that Alaska will face more of those when they do more drilling for oil. Hope it’s worth it!
2545 2018-01-23 19:07:09 I don't understand why it would be a bad thing to improve air quality even if it were a hoax. (It isn't)

Why keep destroying mountains, and having oil spills, and watching coal miners die just because "it's a hoax"

We found a cheaper, safer option, and would like to move to it.
2546 2018-01-23 19:07:04 Hopefully not. Because Venezuela has a lot of minerals, metals, oil, and resources including uranium. It's not the same case as Cuba.
2547 2018-01-23 19:07:04 apparently a humidifier is supposed to help. a dab of vitamin e oil works for me though.
2548 2018-01-23 19:06:58 FINALLY got my oil changed lol I was only 5,000 miles over

2551 2018-01-23 19:06:35 Don’t get suckered again into voting for Donnie, the snake oil salesman.
2552 2018-01-23 19:06:33 I'm not sure if the people themselves could vote on the oil drilling that they'd want it, but maybe.
2553 2018-01-23 19:06:32 hahahaha dude,again I'm not trying to be elitist or anything,but have you ever studied international relations/politics? It isn't an excuse. Neoliberal Capitalism and everything puts pressures on other forms of government. The fact that it failed due to oil price crash proves it.
2554 2018-01-23 19:06:29 COOKING TIP: Before placing homemade pizza into the oven, sprinkle with some extra virgin olive oil for a silkier taste and lush texture.

2578 2018-01-23 19:03:42 @realDonaldTrump And the China oil spill is the reason I am (and have always been) AGAINST drilling in the ocean!  The risks are too great.  I believe they still have residual effects of the 2010 Gulf spill.
2579 2018-01-23 19:03:28 Hi twitter
2580 2018-01-23 19:03:27 To be fair, Louisiana and Texas want them. But then let an oil well blow and it ruins fishing and shrimping for a year, kills many sea birds and helps enlarge the "dead zone", the area of the Gulf with very low oxygen.
2581 2018-01-23 19:03:26 Before Iraq war all the oil was controlled by the government, no foreign companies were allowed to drill. Now all the usual suspects are in there and oil production has increased. Thank god our freedoms are protected and measured by the P&L’s of fossil fuel companies

2584 2018-01-23 19:03:16 Taking an observation on Venezuela a top oil reserve nation, an intricate web of triggers come into play on defaults, ranging from dutch disease to governance policies to the  political system.
2585 2018-01-23 19:03:11 America was build on guns violence and bloodshed. They’re world survival is on weapons and oil... how long till the Top dog becomes another story in history... which will turn into a country of savages...
2586 2018-01-23 19:02:59 The people of Alaska shouldn’t be surprised about the massive earthquake this morning... this is what happens when you frack for oil.
2587 2018-01-23 19:02:56 So @McDonalds gave me horrifyingly bad food. We went to @BurgerKing and guess what! Fries that had been in the oil maybe half a second (inedible) and chicken fries that were cold and hard as a damn rock. Wasted about 18 dollars today on food we can't eat. Thanks, McD's and BK!
2588 2018-01-23 19:02:54 It’s not just the UK, the same thing happened in Australia and France to name just 2. The auto and oil industry lobbied Governments aggressively to convince them rail was finished.
2589 2018-01-23 19:02:49 So.. Venezuela is about to make their own crypto currency (petro). The gov. Is basically going to make 1 petro = 1 Barrel of oil (cost). It’s an interesting idea. I’m sure there will be roadblocks
2590 2018-01-23 19:02:46 The good news is religious snake oil salesmen like @tperkins are being exposed for the lying hustlers they are. The bad news is millions of adults don't care as long as their #FakeChristian club(s) maintain power & privilege.
2591 2018-01-23 19:02:44 Bless Charlie for telling me to save the extra bits of oil, I decided fuck it and just did a bunch of small injections for the correct dosage.
2592 2018-01-23 19:02:39 Who owns the whisky, the salmon oil ?
2593 2018-01-23 19:02:38 odd you choose hypocrisy.. little projection maybe?  Historically it was western intervention in the region that split it apart into spheres of influence (over oil concerns) and set the region on its head... your solution seems to be 'keep the status quo'!
2594 2018-01-23 19:02:35 Felt hot first then achy then the tickly cough. I’m imbibing zinc, vitamin C and olbas oil in the hope it doesn’t come to anything

2596 2018-01-23 19:02:17 That’s crazy. Trump did nothing but talk up coal and oil all election and a family full of solar employees didn’t see an issue.

2599 2018-01-23 19:02:04 Pat, with due respect I believe you're confusing SM access with SM membership. All countries have SM access w/o having to be members of the SM e.g. USA, China, Singapore. Trade won't stop - Europeans will still want to buy whisky/crude oil & we will still want to buy BMWs #Brexit

2601 2018-01-23 19:01:55 vick’s vapor rub on your chest and under your nose, lots of tea (throat coat is the best for a soar throat but a good honey lavender will be nice too), drink water, nothing dairy based, eucalyptus oil on your temples/in a diffuser. those are my best remedies!

2607 2018-01-23 19:01:29 He fooled a lot of people. Some of my family and friends who are intelligent were taken in by this snake oil salesman. They also say " never again".

2610 2018-01-23 19:01:03 Apparently I’m not the only one who wanted an oil changed today  there’s a huge line and the shop is short staffed. Wonderful.
2611 2018-01-23 19:00:46 I’m not gonna lie... I just watched a 2-3 second loop of oil being put on Bria Myles’ ass like 10 times ... I couldn’t help it cause she gotta phatty 
2612 2018-01-23 19:00:37 Uhhhhh tell that to bombs the US drops in the middle east, after starting and participating in, if I'm not mistaken, 3 wars over there. For the sake of "intervention" or keeping the US dollar worth something (its backed by oil)
2613 2018-01-23 19:00:31 Getting my oil changed and gotta watch SOMETHING! :) You were really crushing it, though.
2614 2018-01-23 19:00:25 Lavender oil works wonders

2619 2018-01-23 19:00:06 Did you know that some castor oils have been washed with hexane? Not St. Francis Castor Oil. It's organic & comes in a dark glass bottle.
2620 2018-01-23 19:00:04 Those are things that mix like Oil and Water.
2621 2018-01-23 18:59:40 yep - with olive oil/garlic or used to stuff a red pepper
2622 2018-01-23 18:59:20  Everything they do is so infuriating and stupid. MAGA means make America white and stupid. How many good paying jobs will be lost? Stopping #Solar won't raise the price of oil. #UnfifLyingDimwit #TerroristTrump
2623 2018-01-23 18:59:17 The Palm oil industry is pretty horrendous too.

2627 2018-01-23 18:58:28 Trump is still promoting "clean" coal, repugnicans are owned by the oil and gas industry.

2631 2018-01-23 18:57:09 I just saw a guy with a lit cigar in his mouth, checking the oil of his truck. Lmfao If that ain’t the most Hialeah thing I’ve seen 
2632 2018-01-23 18:57:03 Solar can't compete with big oil or "clean" coal.... you know, the renewable energy. SMH
2633 2018-01-23 18:57:02 Republicans:  The retarded reality TV star that you inexplicably elected to be President of the United States has once again demonstrated that he isn’t qualified to clean toilets.  The future lies in clean renewable energy, not oil and coal. Country in front of party, please!
2634 2018-01-23 18:56:41 A man was ranting about the “flipping stupid GBP” as a currency. Then obv went on and on about crypto & Bitcoin. And I feel I should be more interested but find many of the champions very off-putting. Very medicine-show/snake oil.

2637 2018-01-23 18:56:26 Please be oil based! 
2638 2018-01-23 18:56:23 actually i don't think it's wise to eat much of them the dough took so much oil i was impressed
but i was thinking in sharing with u
2639 2018-01-23 18:56:07 If this is true, I hope she FRIES SLOWLY IN OIL when she gets to Hell.
2640 2018-01-23 18:55:59 That's nothing - let's put a tariff on the renewable energy technology we need to wean ourselves off oil. Oh we could have been investing in those industries ourselves but "clean coal"
2641 2018-01-23 18:55:57 The worst thing about having an hour commute isn’t all the driving it’s that I have to get an oil change like once a month and it’s my least favorite activity
2642 2018-01-23 18:55:36 と、夜勤中にゲームのことを考えているのでありました。

2644 2018-01-23 18:55:20 It's been a year of anxiety for about 63% of us - eliminating regulations on water, air, the environment, oil rigs, elder abuse, ignoring climate change, making us pay for a wall we don't want and that Mexico was supposed to pay for, not going after McKesson opioid abuse
2645 2018-01-23 18:55:19 romance is: you calling me from the Essential Oil store asking me if I need anything. incense, shea butter, and oils. 
2646 2018-01-23 18:55:18 once i saw the vanilla body oil and handcuffs i had go sign out and never check the in the cart list again 
2647 2018-01-23 18:55:13 These snake oil dealers recognize their own. That much is for sure.

2658 2018-01-23 18:54:02 I still go the food pantry for the oil slicked topped peanut butter...it’s the best.....
2659 2018-01-23 18:54:00 The so called "most popular politician" is also the biggest criminal offender of the country. He commanded a criminal organization that destroyed Petrobras (as you know the brazilian oil company made a deal to pay US$ 2,95 Bilions to end up a "class action") 
He is a CRIMINAL
2660 2018-01-23 18:53:54 Ayo if anyone needs their oil changed or tires rotated I'll do it for free cuz I be bored and doing stuff on cars is fun. But yall would need the tools and oil etc  cuz I'm not paying for that
2661 2018-01-23 18:53:51 I don't think it's motivated by dem vs rep. I think it's because his greedy buddies say coal and oil. Fracking stupid if you ask me.
2662 2018-01-23 18:53:39 The Republicans' opposition to renewable energy, their promotion coal, oil & gas, their failure to limit greenhouse gas emissions, their elimination of environmental protections & their insane denial of climate change are grave threats to life on Earth. #Resist #ClimateChange

2667 2018-01-23 18:52:45 Oil free moisturizer and an excellent primer. I use smashbox or a similar brand from ULTA and it should run you $38-$40.
2668 2018-01-23 18:52:32 oh shit lmao my fault, I use mint, marjoram and ginger oil or mint, eucalyptus and white birch oil both mixed with olive oil as the carrier oil

2674 2018-01-23 18:51:47 NC voted for Trump. People need the face the consequences of their poor political choices. So go to the beach and listen to noise of the oil drill and smell the foul stench as you breathe it in.

2681 2018-01-23 18:50:51 Most engines take 5 to 7 quarts of oil. Since about 900 million oil changes are performed in the US each year, this means Americans use over

2695 2018-01-23 18:49:10 Bank of America has concluded that oil demand is going to peak by 2030, then decline forever. We can #breakfree, we can go #100percentclean, and #WAleg can lead the way by passing SB6253.
2696 2018-01-23 18:49:09 And for your information, smart one, I’m a hypnotherapist, not a snake oil salesman. Why can’t we just have an intelligent conversation without the insults? If that’s all you want, then find someone else.

2700 2018-01-23 18:48:54 That's sad, given that in reality Canada is a laggard on most critical issues like #climatechange because it sells oil, promoting peace in the Middle East because it's an arms trafficking nation, and defusing tensions on the Korean peninsula because it's a US toady.

2702 2018-01-23 18:48:49 For your sore throat try oil of oregano and it will be in a dropper. Make sure to not get on tongue. You can put it in orange juice but I chase it. I had the flu and this kicked my sore throat and cough.
2703 2018-01-23 18:48:43 Heat is not always the answer. Try sauteeing the quinoa in garlic and olive oil before you add water. Bake the brown rice in a covered dish with butter, salt and pepper and twice the water at 400. Both these methods end up tasty.

2708 2018-01-23 18:47:56 we don’t even need to drill for oil, we can just use what’s on my face
2709 2018-01-23 18:47:55 With the price of oil increasing wouldn't that 'savings' be eaten up?
2710 2018-01-23 18:47:53 My 2 cents on #OIL is: WTI cracks 65, everyone is gonna #FOMO buy, and then MMs kill it. Wouldn't be shocked if it all happens into tomorrow.
2711 2018-01-23 18:47:44 I started doing a hot oil treatment before I wash and deep condition my hair and It detangles and moisturizes my hair. I love it.

2717 2018-01-23 18:46:33 And yet you regularly agree to allow big oil and coal to cheat? What about the new tariff on solar tech that was just rammed through? How is that a fair advantage?
2718 2018-01-23 18:46:32 I decided to eat a spicy chicken sandwich and now my mouth is completely on fire. You'd think I'd have learned by this age in life. I've read that you can swish with oil to help, but the thought makes me want to vomit. Do instead I'll suffer.

2724 2018-01-23 18:46:01 True oil is one company that has been sued multiple times but you won’t believe me. That’s ok though. I’m not hear to change your mind. My break is over.
2725 2018-01-23 18:45:56 NC will not see any state revenue from this, nor would we see any lower energy prices.  Wind and solar specifically give energy to NC citizens.  Drilling is not an energy generator.  They don't setup oil or gas powered turbines at the rigs.  They take the oil and gas away.
2726 2018-01-23 18:45:55 Could really hurt push for more solar in US. Because big oil and coal  back this #ShitholePresident, not solar businesses.
2727 2018-01-23 18:45:53 Nice sex  and oil
2728 2018-01-23 18:45:49 Russia loves America First, they love our increased military, our soaring stock market, our move to energy independence, continued low oil prices, love we cut Corp taxes and bringing overseas money back.  At least, that's what I'm supposed to believe
2729 2018-01-23 18:45:42 We also subsidize big oil. And telecom, and railways, and airlines....
2730 2018-01-23 18:45:42 Just got an oil change/car wash & paid /tipped on my debit card. As I was leaving the lady that washed my car knocked on window asking where her tip was  #holyawkward
2731 2018-01-23 18:45:36 We only got one mechanic to get around 43 trucks at work.. so we’re behind on oil changes,our boss asks for suggestions, so I say we should just change it our selves to help our mechanic out.. and allllll the bitching and moaning comes out . 
2732 2018-01-23 18:45:27 Working Families are every bit as crony capitalist in their methods as the most powerful oil firms. My values just align with theirs. But I cannot support these methods, and the attempt to permeate our electoral process with crude capitalism. It's undemocratic. #onpoli #cdnpoli

Cut in half (after scrubbing clean) pop in seasoning & some oil. Wrap in tin foil. Into hot oven. Then check in about 8-10mins by squeezing then very gently. Max 30mins
2735 2018-01-23 18:45:17 Venezuela has straight up goons running the country, with access to unimaginable amounts of oil money. 

They led us to three main problems: service shortages, record-high crime rate and hyperinflation. There's others, of course, but these are the ones that affect everybody.

2737 2018-01-23 18:45:08 Castor & coconut oils for incredible nourishment; broccoli seed oil for incredible shine. it's literally veggies for yr hair! #BurntSugar
2738 2018-01-23 18:45:07 and certainly won't help shake our oil dependency
2739 2018-01-23 18:44:52 When you have a shithole POTUS, this kind of stuffs going to happen. Evidently the oil and coal guys offered a much bigger bribe than you guys did. Trump is corrupt through & through, he’s a total embarrassment to the US we are the laughingstock of the world
2740 2018-01-23 18:44:51 @AmazonHelp Please tell your in-house delivery drivers to stop pulling into residential driveways to deliver packages. On a related question, how do I get car oil out of concrete? cc @kl34n
2741 2018-01-23 18:44:43 Wow. Please turn in your man card at the door.
2742 2018-01-23 18:44:41 Just did two oil changes and two tire rotations.
2743 2018-01-23 18:44:38 they hate the fact tht wev ruined the “ staus quo “ oil money buying success ruining football to name a few ... im sick of hearing it they bought success for years
2744 2018-01-23 18:44:23 I've got an artisan rapeseed oil press startup going on in the basement after hours
2745 2018-01-23 18:44:20 ive been meaning to stop using oil to stir fry my veggies and finally did tonight for dinner and it actually tastes good. I can feel there's a certain taste/texture missing but it's still good.
2746 2018-01-23 18:44:17 Oil is finite and running out fast
2747 2018-01-23 18:44:16 I had no idea Snake Oil Salesman (SOS) had a union

2751 2018-01-23 18:43:51 it is sad how last century your policies are. Bro the next generation don’t give a fuck about oil, we about that solar.
2752 2018-01-23 18:43:49 Bought myself a essential oil diffuser/ humidifier... life has changed for me.. I’m all about the meditation, aromatherapy type life
2753 2018-01-23 18:43:47  why do I feel like you're lying about caster oil though
2754 2018-01-23 18:43:36 If she work for the lord, I got that ointment oil. Amen?
2755 2018-01-23 18:43:33 Wow, this chump just imposed a 30% tariff on solar panels virtually killing the solar industry. Solar employs more people than coal and oil combined. Today's decision will cause the loss of roughly 23,000 American jobs this year. Way to go @potus #DividerInChief
2756 2018-01-23 18:43:33 "The phoniest and nastiest things in the world cannot be pursued or even pursued - they must be kissed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
2757 2018-01-23 18:43:27 cuz off dead ends + castor oil
2758 2018-01-23 18:43:27 In addition to the ecological risks, much of the refined petroleum will be exported, increasing a trend we're already seeing.  Higher prices for us and less energy security.  Only the oil giants win.
2759 2018-01-23 18:43:21 Honestly I use coconut oil for everything just bc of the smell 
2760 2018-01-23 18:42:53 Honey, mayo, lemon, peppermint, coconut oil, tea tree oil, Jamaican black castor oil, and a bit of moisturizing conditioner if you want you’re curls poppin’ ladies.

You’re welcome.
2761 2018-01-23 18:42:51 Tarrifs on energy be other than oil only help the #Trump dynasty. That's his job... it's not president!!!
2762 2018-01-23 18:42:46 this coffee & coconut oil mask is fucking brilliant 
2763 2018-01-23 18:42:45 He's so fkn predictable in his horribleness, he cares only about his big oil buddies. This is also what that 'Windmills kill the birds' nonsense was about a while back.
2764 2018-01-23 18:42:39 Try boiling some water with some eucalyptus oil, it helps to breathe.
2765 2018-01-23 18:42:16 okay I've done oil pulling for three days now, am I immortal yet
2766 2018-01-23 18:42:13 The shithole police are using live bullets to disperse crowds trying to get there hands on the oil at Kachok.
2767 2018-01-23 18:41:55 Maybe he is thinking of the need to blend the extra million barrels of light oil with heavier Venezuelan oil. But certainly Venezuela is not the only supplier--Saudi and Canada send the most <30 API.
2768 2018-01-23 18:41:40 $CL OIL moves higher?
2769 2018-01-23 18:41:39 i got my dog a tea tree oil body wash and i used it when i ran out of mine and i really liked it too

2776 2018-01-23 18:41:01 Again, it’s all good, I’m glad she’s giving these groups a voice, but as mentioned earlier, not a word about Oil.
2777 2018-01-23 18:40:56 The solar power industry employs more people in US than oil, gas, & coal combined.

Solar power is the energy source for now, and in the future.

A 30% tariff will kill installation of solar panels, as cost prohibitive. That's intentional.

Loss of jobs & technology will hurt US
2778 2018-01-23 18:40:41 Is this as bad as a school shooting? Or is it not so bad because Oil and Gas are protected industries?
2779 2018-01-23 18:40:37 When you get a hot oil burn on top of your rug burn but it doesn't hurt too bad because there is no healthy skin left.

2781 2018-01-23 18:40:04 It's simple. 3tbsp of olive oil, 1tbsp of white wine vinegar, a thinly sliced roasted onion, 4 dried dates for the vinaigrette. A quarter rough chopped cabbage, about 1cup med dice carrots, & a med dice potato with 1tbsp harissa paste mixed w/olive oil roasted @ 450F. And fish.
2782 2018-01-23 18:40:04 We had red Tories we got Thatcher lite. Yet another right winger trotting out their go to on Venezuela who use western propaganda to discredit a government that has seen oil prices collapse & economic war waged against it. Look up CIA South American intervention might inform view

2786 2018-01-23 18:38:52 fake protectionist measure to favor Trumps buddies in oil &coal business.  Thankfully we still have FTA’s to protect U.S. exports, for now.
2787 2018-01-23 18:38:52 I also started a swing short on Crude oil at 64.50 today. First cover at 61.65, then all the way to 57.
2788 2018-01-23 18:38:44 Three muses: oil on masonite, 36" x 24" each panel. 2011. $5, 575 (for the set; $2,250, each)  Shipping included within the continental US.
2789 2018-01-23 18:38:40 I literally had the most ginger dream possible last night: I was at the beach & didn’t have sun screen & all anyone else had was tanning oil... truly a nightmare
2790 2018-01-23 18:38:24 Nonpartisan?  Ur kidding, Trump is trying to kill all green technologies in favor of coal & oil... by doing this they are hoping to force people to forego adding solar panels to their homes
2791 2018-01-23 18:38:23 Bravo! I have followed the links back to the 62% claim, most of those "self made billionaires" are in government protected/subsidised industries (IP, banking, finance) or own/control natural resources like land, radio spectrum or oil etc, all of which have shot up in value.
2792 2018-01-23 18:38:22 Airbus  Helicopters has reported a fall in 2017 deliveries, to 409 helicopters  from 418 units shipped in the previous year, reflecting weakness in the  civil #oil and #gas industry.

2798 2018-01-23 18:37:39 We need to stop sacrificing our boys to this ridiculous war. We need to withdraw all aid from the ME & lead a world wide embargo of their oil. Let them starve & fight with sticks & stones. Plus, we need to deport all refugees to make America safe again.

2851 2018-01-23 18:32:42 The Kurdish people certainly have the same rights of sovereignty as Mexico and the US.  Intervention at the end of ww1 broke the region up by oil fields.. not cultural.. destabilizing the region until today.
2852 2018-01-23 18:32:39 Trump to add his signature to bill making solar panels much more expensive. He's doing this to help out his big Oil partners. He's not just an enemy of the people, Trump's an enemy of the environment. Hopefully he'll explode from all the hate and venom stored inside his fat body.
2853 2018-01-23 18:32:34 No I’m saying don’t spend 20billion on a wall and stop investing in oil. We don’t have to cave to anyone. Be smart. Be respectable. Run the country instead of tweeting a million times a day and picking fights like a child.

Alternative fuels are not cost effective nor anywhere close to where tree huggers thought they would be. Coal, oil and natural gas RULE
2856 2018-01-23 18:32:17 And Putin who is dependent on an oil economy.
2857 2018-01-23 18:32:12 The entire Trump brigade will come tumbling down.
Those who back him are complicit traitors or easily maneuvered simpletons that sipped the snake oil.
The damage to our country will take years to repair.
But as a country we've rebounded before.
We'll claw our way back again.

2861 2018-01-23 18:31:48 The Koch brothers (oil) have been trying to drive up the cost of solar (and wind) for years, both at the State level and Federal while enjoying subsidies for oil production. Follow the money.

2864 2018-01-23 18:31:33 The parallel is northeastern European art, the oil paintings. It's just not up-to-date art history texts.  It's stunning finding people who look like us in oil, seriously painted, rather than Meds.
2865 2018-01-23 18:31:23 I recently discovered the beauty of olive oil. It literrally can act as an ingredient on its own ... a little drizzle on boiled potatoes with kosher salt and vegetables tastes perfect

2868 2018-01-23 18:31:02 Any kind of oil scalp treatment is best for this issue. Simply apply  around three to six drops onto your scalp. Massage it gently and leave  it in for five to ten minutes before rinsing it out completely.
2869 2018-01-23 18:30:57 Sorry not tracking this stock now a days fundamentally..though broadly i think it won't move much due to rising crude oil prices..Closing above 395.70 is important..trend is weak...368 is the most crucial level...
2870 2018-01-23 18:30:57 haha idk if you read my earlier replies but I once had a carmex tube explode in my mouth bc I left it in a hot car.... so no tube for me! does coconut oil and vitamin e oil come in a harder substance or are you like dabbing the oil on? your ways sound very promising
2871 2018-01-23 18:30:56 а днеска на Blackwall Tunnel е имало задръстване заради oil spillage . супер мерси, че ми казахте
2872 2018-01-23 18:30:46 What about taxing solar panels, which will kill US jobs? I thought y’all were about MAGA... or is that only for coal/oil gas?
2873 2018-01-23 18:30:39 What’s a work around? Think! Keep going. Bring it in in parts? Make it here, assemble it here? Meet with progressive State leaders. Whatever it takes! Keep the media in the loop so we have a record of how he’s manipulating growth industries for his oil cronies.

2877 2018-01-23 18:30:16 @NWPCOC @NWPCCA Happy to support @GayleforCA for Lt. Gov of CA. People-powered, progressive, and corporate-free who took on Chevron Oil as Mayor of Richmond, CA and won!
2878 2018-01-23 18:30:15 Glad Loving Vincent is on the list. Every frame is a Van Gogh style oil painting. Simply a Spectacle to behold. But it’s coco because Pixar on form is unbeatable. Too bad no LEGO Batman
2879 2018-01-23 18:30:14 Just FaceTimed my uncle from an oil barge . He goes exon Mobil pays he’s employer $120,000 a day just to make use of their vessel(ship) .the least you can rent the barge is 3 months . Bruh !!!!
2880 2018-01-23 18:30:09 I can see that attitude working for trucks. Worst case you have to get out and walk.

When a helicopter stops working the pilots /die/.

You'd think that would encourage them to change the oil.

And it works so far? It's only been like three days ahaha. But it's recommend for ppl who get eczema and psoriasis. It's not a pleasant texture, super heavy, but it's effective?

2899 2018-01-23 18:27:34 Big oil is not the enemy who held us down, they supplied us with a means to an end. Still, change is needed. My money is on tidal, geothermal and hydro power. They are clean, reliable and safe. Wind and solar are too fickle.
2900 2018-01-23 18:27:29 You find a tweet where we've stated that and FairPlay to you. mind you even since the oil money at any point have you defended a title? Making it sound like your dominating English football
2901 2018-01-23 18:27:21 @SazonSmitty they had the nerve to put it on a drying rack like fat and oil were gonna drip off lmaoo
2902 2018-01-23 18:27:18 castor oil worked for me, or vaseline to tame them more. but coconut oil only made the skin around mine oilier and didn't do anything for growth
2903 2018-01-23 18:27:13 Coconut oil in your hair over night should help take care of the knots
2904 2018-01-23 18:27:10 So tired of going to get an oil change and having the dealership tell me I should really have all of this stuff done costing over $1000...how about no. #ijustwantmyoilchanged #thishappenseverytime
2905 2018-01-23 18:26:36 I bought the Lemon Brightening oil for the first time. I must say im impressed on how big tbe bottle is especially for the price! Thank you for not being stingy @CoriumSkincare

2910 2018-01-23 18:26:21 What’s it going to take for the Republicans to impeach Trump? Our National Security is non-existent, Kushner is selling us out to China, Scott Price has gotten rid of the EPA.  Oil drilling seems to be at the top of the list. Session is urging the FBI director to fire his staff.
2911 2018-01-23 18:26:13 Jeez. It’s as if you don’t even care about oil company execs’ bonuses. Heartless.
2912 2018-01-23 18:26:11 The only person who needs psychoanalysing is Mr Blair. Sending his own troops and Iraqi children to bloody graves in the name of oil is not indicative of clear-thinking, mentally stable leader.

I am waiting for t soul less Murkowski t start drilling off t coast of Alaska. Do you think a 7.9 magnitude earthquake coupled with no logistical way t contain any oil spill ( no roads, lodging, cold climate) wil create pause t thought? Tsunami. Complex ecosystem?
2914 2018-01-23 18:25:51 dear @KFCSA
Thanks for implementing the R99 tuesday 12 piece bucket. 
but, surly with long queues and waiting 30min the standard of your product should be the same as those on any other day? the  purchased tonight was drenched in oil, fatty, and below standard. 

so irritated
2915 2018-01-23 18:25:46 Been to two quick oil change spots in and NC, both made me give them the keys and get out the car. Very inconvenient.

2921 2018-01-23 18:25:09 That equates to “all whites being killed” because I’m still waiting for you to back up that statement? Thus far you sound like a charlatan who preys on people’s fears. A snake oil salesman with no logical argument for the bollocks you’re spewing.
2922 2018-01-23 18:25:04 We raise corn and soybeans. #corn goes for feed or ethanol, whose by-products go to feed. Soybeans go to crushers for oil and meal.

2942 2018-01-23 18:22:53 It is unreal that we are not only propping up a dying industry but going the OPPOSITE way and killing a FLEDGLING industry. Wonder how much coal/oil interests pay congress for something like this?
2943 2018-01-23 18:22:50 Guys  @Teresa_Giudice said “oil and vinegar” instead of “oil and water” . I love this woman

2945 2018-01-23 18:22:32 It’s truly disappointing that Iutdoor Retailer moves to a State with 44k oil and gas wells & rapidly growing, with fracking near/under homes, schools, and parks further greenwashing the Dem elected leaders who enable it.

You are different, not 
unequal.
2948 2018-01-23 18:22:03 Trump is good at causing layoffs. Coal is dead. Oil is not nearly as needed as Trump wants people to think. But Trump doesn't care if the world is polluted and choking everyone, including the planet itself. And he is just too stupid to look at the truth about green energy.
2949 2018-01-23 18:21:55 We are only headed closer to crazy town with the liar in the Oval Office. We are drilling for oil and building walls. It’s 2018 not 1973.

2954 2018-01-23 18:21:24 Just got back from the dentist. Crazy woman at the reception window arguing about needing a painful tooth extracted. 
"But I've been pulling with coconut oil!" She said this 5 times. 
"Did it work?"
 "Well, no.." 
"That's because it doesn't work."
2955 2018-01-23 18:21:22 Subway ticked me off today. That lady was really trying me. She put 2 cucumbers on my sandwich, and 3, THREE pickles. I was like um can I have more than like 3 pickles? And then I was like do you guys have just oil? “Well not in packets.” Did I ask for a packet?
2956 2018-01-23 18:21:15 Exactly why i procrastinate getting my oil changed. I’ve been in here for 3 whole hours
2957 2018-01-23 18:21:06 #maga #dupes hahaha! Some more lead tainted snake oil for you dummies to ingest. LOL you #maga #dupes are the best.
2958 2018-01-23 18:20:58 Lots of reasons. Mining. Oil. Gas. Power generation. And at the other end of the scale, doctors, aid workers, health professionals, teachers. No reason why Kabul residents shouldn’t receive the best of what the world has to offer. But you’re right, people look at risk differently
2959 2018-01-23 18:20:57 Trying to hurry up & get this oil changed
2960 2018-01-23 18:20:52 Reading oil as "Ozil" .... I really need help.

2963 2018-01-23 18:20:37 Another aspect is that China pollutes its environment with the highly toxic residues from solar panels-less regulation, lower labor costs, lower prices. The US will not be able to produce them affordably. Big oil, big coal loves this move.
2964 2018-01-23 18:20:36 I do not think they should. To start with, are we looking for a passive or investment strategy? If you believe "cost is king", and buy the FTSE you're into tobacco, oil and banks.
2965 2018-01-23 18:20:34 But @realDonaldTrump you know what else using dolor energy does? It means we can actually breath our air. Because oil and coal pollute our air, and since you’re cool with companies chopping all the trees down. You’re making it mad hard for us to be able to breathe.
2966 2018-01-23 18:20:31 Right. Cause rural South Africans Amazon’d in Neem oil , I just can’t

2976 2018-01-23 18:20:07 Nope. He's a 3rd line guy who is fine as a piece but not much else.
2977 2018-01-23 18:20:04 To be honest,not sure I would mind...I remember summers at our cottage lighting in the evening our oil lamps was nice and poetic,and preparing our meals fresh mainly from our garden was lovely!Technology facilitated our lives in many ways,BUT we lost a lot overusing,abusing it...

2983 2018-01-23 18:19:46 Our cars could be made and run on hemp like the T Modell from Ford. We could of avoided the oil drama we are going to experience by using gasoline made of hemp. We would of never needed GMO cotton nor destroy our forests for paper by using hemp .. etc.

2994 2018-01-23 18:18:54 See @realDonaldTrump what solar energy does is it alleviates our dependence on coal and oil. Does it kill those industries? No. But guess what you can do as President if people lose their jobs... RETRAIN THEM TO WORK IN HE SOLAR INDUSTRY.
2995 2018-01-23 18:18:49 venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world so maybe it’s not about that

maybe, just maybe, all you need to prevent dictatorships is term limits
2996 2018-01-23 18:18:47 The only realpolitiks is the politics of energy (controlling supplies & trade of oil, rare earth metals for batteries, etc)- which is, of course, a synonym for POWER. Everything else is downsteam of this. Capital as laymen understand it is a relic of former centuries.
2997 2018-01-23 18:18:42 That's why people were made beggars on streets in Nov
 2016; that's why the benefit of reduction in oil prices are not given to the citizens?
2998 2018-01-23 18:18:40 The oil industry is Alberta’s economy. In about 50 retweets and tweets, she never mentioned “Oil” once. But, gays, trans, and misogyny take up most of her thread. As important as they are, there’s more to AB than this. Hillary campaigned on smears and look what it got her.
2999 2018-01-23 18:18:37 At Walmart getting my oil changed
3000 2018-01-23 18:18:29 Perhaps it would be useful to distinguish consequences accordingly? A remorseless web made up of microaggressions is a different experience from discrete ‘meteor strikes’. Reminds me also of Brent Spar policy issue: ‘it’s only one oil rig’/‘they’re *all* only one oil rig’
3001 2018-01-23 18:18:22 Oh I don't have oil ahaha. And I mean that I can rub my moisturizer off. It pills on my skin. I looked it up and it might be bc of the silicone stuff they use to make it spreadable? Idk. My face doesn't want to accept anything but it's soooooooo dry.
I use cera-ve now tho.
3002 2018-01-23 18:18:21 I’ve had a pretty productive day for far! Oil change is done now to go home and work on some packing before work! You?

3004 2018-01-23 18:18:20 7 feared dead in oil tanker accident in kisumu.KTN is the source
3005 2018-01-23 18:18:02 No it's a lot worse than that. It is propping up coal & oil burning electric utilities increasing pollution. Solar was just starting to become competitive, increasing costs will set it back costing jobs & adding to pollution.
3006 2018-01-23 18:17:46 Five people die, more than ten others injured after an oil tanker fell on a Tuk Tuk full of passengers at Kachok in Kisumu.
3007 2018-01-23 18:17:45 The main reason for the oil to be still around is that it’s traded in USD, the reserve currency. OK and the profits. But, this may also cost US its superpower status in two decades b/c the world is moving away from oil quicker now, while US is still reluctant for obvious reasons.
3008 2018-01-23 18:17:41 I wear facial oil instead of moisturizer so that’s probably why it doesn’t dry my skin out
3009 2018-01-23 18:17:35 Then who brings these #ISIS in Afghanistan by helicopter?
#ISIS were in Iraq & nearby so how it possible the hundreds of #ISIS suddenly comes in Afghanistan?
World knows the America is behind these militants to occupy the oil & gas assets with in the Iraq & Syria !
3010 2018-01-23 18:17:30 The "spirit" was there long before the government, and will be there long after it is gone. ND gov. + Big Oil is not helping it by poisoning it all over the place for short term "gain".
3011 2018-01-23 18:17:28 China “dumps” all sorts of products into the U.S. markets. Why are solar panels “special”? Because it helps #Trump’s cronies in oil, gas, and coal like the Kochs. This is meant to suppress renewable energy, not promote domestic manufacturing.
3012 2018-01-23 18:17:27 Did you know Canada and Mexico are the top two export destinations for US oil and gas? #NAFTA is the reason the US, Canada, and Mexico are within striking distance of achieving North American energy self sufficiency. #NAFTAWorks  And our energy investments are worth protecting!!
3013 2018-01-23 18:17:16 Does castor oil work? I want thicker lashes 
3014 2018-01-23 18:17:16 Can you imagine the GOP shitstorm if Obama used an executive order to place a tariff on coal and oil? #SolarPower
3015 2018-01-23 18:17:15 Your anger upsets the planetary vibrations. Rub some turmeric coconut oil on your temples.
3016 2018-01-23 18:17:05 5 people die, more than 10 others injured after an oil tanker fell on a tuk tuk full of passengers
3017 2018-01-23 18:16:55 Bring the oil to the boil
3018 2018-01-23 18:16:54 It's an old oil thing, isn't it?
3019 2018-01-23 18:16:50 I always try to persuade others to stay away from creatine. Only supplements I recommend are protein,multi vitamin, and fish oil
3020 2018-01-23 18:16:31 babe massaged peppermint essential oil into my scalp. the most soothing experience.
3021 2018-01-23 18:16:16 It's... divisive in the house. I also really love that seaweed salad with like, the glass noodley looking stuff and sesame oil
3022 2018-01-23 18:16:06 I really like it! And I have two deluxe samples.  I used it and then just put some oil on and my skin felt super smooth.
3023 2018-01-23 18:16:03 Or orders from Russian to promote coal & oil as energy sources instead.

3025 2018-01-23 18:15:56 I have no idea sorry , I have a friend with dry skin and she is sleeping with coconut oil then in the morning washing it of and using an oil based moisturizer and drink a lot of water, seems to work for her atleast 
3026 2018-01-23 18:15:56 The whole thing is oil paintings It’s the wildest thing I’ve ever seen
3027 2018-01-23 18:15:55 Netflix still +9%, Micron +3%, Apple +1%, but now Bitcoin +5%, up to 11354. Meanwhile SunPower -7% even though oil +1.2%. (Usually solar energy stocks go up when oil prices go up.)
3028 2018-01-23 18:15:53 Get yourself some lavender oil, few drops in a hot bath really helps 
3029 2018-01-23 18:15:35 Are you calling Sheikh Monsour an oil crook then?? I'd be very careful what you tweet sonny
3030 2018-01-23 18:15:29 Neem oil didnt exist in the area where I saw complications , next :

3033 2018-01-23 18:15:23 Coconut oil is life
3034 2018-01-23 18:15:21 This is all good - the more options we have the better but isn’t domestic oil gushing toward self sufficiency on its own now?
3035 2018-01-23 18:15:18 Thank you for this follow up. You know I am simple and thought "I mean sure if her oil needs to be changed I don't mind sharing" but you mean if her cervix needs to be pushed back.
3036 2018-01-23 18:15:06 The US have just raised taxes on solar panels and are letting big oil co drill in the oceans.  It’s time to make American War by @omarelakkad mandatory reading!  We’re heading there fast! #SolarPower #environment #GlobalWarming
3037 2018-01-23 18:15:01 Skin care tip:

People with oily skin tend to over strip their skin by washing it to much, using alcohol, or any harsh products to "stop" the oil but that's just making it worse which is why you might feel even more oily.
3038 2018-01-23 18:15:00 Finally getting my oil changed after being about 800 miles over.
3039 2018-01-23 18:14:56 Where’s a good place I can get my transmission and engine oil changed for a good price??
3040 2018-01-23 18:14:35 Don't forget your country has started more wars than anyone, invades countries for oil and sells arms to both sides of conflicts. And yet still its democracy is one of the best we have, as unjust as it often is.
3041 2018-01-23 18:14:33 Ok on 3 everybody say “Big Oil”

Are we a Limited Government or are we not?

(sigh.)
3046 2018-01-23 18:13:43 I still have to collect the 100 trinkets and burn 30 soldiers with oil, and the DLC appears, hell, to play!
3047 2018-01-23 18:13:35 Put some coconut oil on it
3048 2018-01-23 18:13:26 Doesn't this make exports more difficult? Although oil is cheaper as a result but this has cut revenues from North Sea oil as a result too.

3055 2018-01-23 18:12:58 they finished changing my oil almost 30 minutes ago but they forgot to wash my car & I was like nbd but the guy insisted so I’m still wasting away over here... bored out of my mind
3056 2018-01-23 18:12:54 someone was doing fucking oil in the bathrooms lol
3057 2018-01-23 18:12:52 Cum lube like Spunk is best for genital use because it's going to be body safe, the only downside is it tastes horrid, so I use coconut oil for mouth stuff.
3058 2018-01-23 18:12:37 Congrats mate fully deserved 
3059 2018-01-23 18:12:29 Well the oil & tire change is a given it better ride better or I’m taking it back lol

3061 2018-01-23 18:12:25 mmm I use this seaweed oil control gel cream from the body shop! But I realized that's probably not good for the dry areas of my face so I tried using Laneige's water bank gel cream on those areas and it's better today! but what do you mean that it comes off your skin?
3062 2018-01-23 18:12:24 I hate getting my oil changed
3063 2018-01-23 18:12:23 But we won’t do that either cause your tax dollars are going towards building a stupid wall. Ask the Chinese how their wall worked. Or the French how the maginot line held up. It’s 2018 and we are drilling for more oil and building walls like romans keeping barbarians out. #fool
3064 2018-01-23 18:11:48 It’s a tariff to protect coal, oil, and gas. It does not encourage American manufacturers of solar because it applies to the components as well as made up panels. Unless a new process is invented to circumvent existing patents, all parts must be imported.
3065 2018-01-23 18:11:47  hmmmmm,  oil strictly as a fuel or does it include all uses of Petroleum products?
3066 2018-01-23 18:11:44 LOL hilarious, coming from a Nigerian (1st export that comes 2 mind is the Nigerian prince & other scams ). And even with big oil reserves, 67% live below poverty line. People who live in glass houses shouldnt throw stones! (PS why r u such an Israel asskiss? Prob for the )
3067 2018-01-23 18:11:31 @93wxrt Let's not even talk about the preponderance of Midnite Oil. Instead let's rap about the Black Crowes. I feel like you think they made three songs spanning two albums. They didn't She Talks To Angels is tired and old. Enough!
3068 2018-01-23 18:11:31 U can make ur own dressing for the salad. What I like is lemon juice olive oil and a pinch of salt. Really basic but so good!
3069 2018-01-23 18:11:30 lmao well u know black womens only need a little coconut oil when they start to dim down.... these other fools on here telling me that 50 year old Halle Berry fell off lmao 
3070 2018-01-23 18:11:28 One focus area for me post- closing of energy hedge funds will be CLNE. Today a believer, large shareholder and board member. Continue to be passionate about its ability to move nat gas into heavy duty truck fleets to address foreign oil threat.

3073 2018-01-23 18:10:43 I used lush 9to 5 oil cleanser and it's great if you want to cleanse your face it makes my face less oily and way calmer but it doesn't take away all my make up

3077 2018-01-23 18:10:14 Nothing you moron becouse women do get paid equally for the jobs they do! The pay gap is a myth! The only “gap” exists between different jobs and positions. A teacher will never earn as much as a oil worker.
3078 2018-01-23 18:10:14 In the long-term, the #Aden refinery power plant will be repaired to import and refine more crude oil. #YCHO
3079 2018-01-23 18:10:13 Poisonous, environmentally damaging, war inflicting, greedy lobby backed oil industry’s subsidies are about $5-5.5 trillion versus worldwide renewable subsidies are about $80-100 billion. The ratio is worse on 10 year basis and excludes any of the above mentioned damages.

3081 2018-01-23 18:09:48 Don’t know about you, but I liberated two countries that had “brown people” in them.  Once fighting against fellow Muslims, and another fighting against Eastern Orthodox Christians.
Imperialism? How much land and oil did we keep? You stated your motivation, it’s just you.
3082 2018-01-23 18:09:48 I was told by a congressman yrs ago why we don't go to alternative power he said it's all controlled by big oil
3083 2018-01-23 18:09:42 I spilled coconut oil on my phone. I pray my phone don’t over beat bc I can’t let it spread further down my screen. 
3084 2018-01-23 18:09:26 I'm not a true aficionado, but I always loved C&J BBQ, close to campus and about a mile from my parents' house.  Great food but the ambiance is nothing special.  If you want ambiance, go to the Chicken Oil Company in Bryan.
3085 2018-01-23 18:09:20 Didn't you hear t latest? We r going back to gas light street lamps & whale oil? While we fight this, t Chinese r working on electric cars that recharge themselves while riding on solar panel roads. But we created 59,000 coal jobs last year! The Chinese will eat our lunch by 2030
3086 2018-01-23 18:09:10 True! My Dad said, "Don't try to bullshit a bullshitter!" Same thing, sorta. There's a big difference between an intelligent and educated person with the gift of gab, and a snake oil salesman. If I answer with a Yes or No, the people around that know me scratch their heads! LOL!
3087 2018-01-23 18:09:01 Waiting for me to move on is like waiting for oil prices to go low.

3089 2018-01-23 18:08:47 I hear mad people saying they go right into bodega/smoke shops and ask for the thc oil on the sly and they sell them it...but I look like a cop so I need some help.
3090 2018-01-23 18:08:19 @NWPCCA Happy to support @GayleforCA for Lt. Gov of CA. People-powered, progressive, and corporate-free who took on Chevron Oil as Mayor of Richmond, CA and won!
3091 2018-01-23 18:08:17 Too much oil may not run engine but why don't buy alternative energy ?  Welcome discussion @wef on oils
3092 2018-01-23 18:08:13 It's not the memo. It's the already unclassified FISC ruling that has already been made public by the ODNI. Snake oil.
3093 2018-01-23 18:08:05 Day 27 of Whole 30...

“Some say he’s more olive oil than man.”
3094 2018-01-23 18:08:05 finally need an oil change but the thought of waking up early and waiting in a long ass line to get one 
3095 2018-01-23 18:08:02 ตอนนี้ไหล่ไม่ว่าง บัดซบ
3096 2018-01-23 18:07:54 The impoverished communities are the ones where oil and gas companies come in and destroy. When you can’t drink or bathe in the water at your own house.
3097 2018-01-23 18:07:44 Its a secret government plan. Once they've all moved to Europe,  we'll all move to the oil rich countries in the middle east. Loadsamoney.
3098 2018-01-23 18:07:32 3 Reasons I paint with a long black coffee in a safety mug. 
01. If you spill chemicals e.g. turpentine after you wipe it up wipe it over with coffee no more choking smell. 
02. Oil paint on your hands? No probs coffee on a baby wipe.
03. Guys caffeine duh! 
3099 2018-01-23 18:07:24 It will also be fun to watch how long their government programs last when the oil revenue runs out.
3100 2018-01-23 18:07:20 I think it's frightening to know that the issues of oil spills would be given less attention with the removal of @FMEnvng from the PIB. Environmental issues should be taken serious eg the phc soot @Kofi_Bartels @NACGOND @centrelsd @GreatOgoni @SDNNigerDelta @benmurraybruce
3101 2018-01-23 18:07:17 Oil/gas/coal jobs matter more, I guess.

3103 2018-01-23 18:07:15 Vitamin d sup comes from lanolin in sheeps wool who would have guessed ? I cant trust pills or pharma , eat food only . Cod liver oil is better vit d source

3107 2018-01-23 18:06:46 Are Scott Pruitt’s deregulation of oil and industry in Oklahoma the blame for the explosion Monday that killed 5 people?
3108 2018-01-23 18:06:35 check the view from desks and look for eg weird reflections,  potential sun through windows  etc.
oil the door hinges, put the invigilators shoes through a ‘squeak test’
3109 2018-01-23 18:06:20 @SenCoryGardner Will you be encouraging President Trump to impose a 30% tariff on foreign oil to go with solar? Or would that hurt your rich, out of state donors too badly?
3110 2018-01-23 18:06:15 She is an absolute idiot
3111 2018-01-23 18:06:11 Living off of dirty energy is the reason why millions of poor ppl across the globe are dying. We subsidize oil companies with billions of dollars while red states specifically “The Sunshine State” rips away funding& doesn’t allow selling energy back to energy companies
3112 2018-01-23 18:06:05 i’m under the impression that i shouldn’t get a car if i can’t do the basics like change my oil or change a tire 
3113 2018-01-23 18:05:58 Yes I go mix palm oil n water for u with a touch of kerosene ...then make u add faith e go work
3114 2018-01-23 18:05:48 Some will do anything to hurt alternative energy sources so that oil companies can continue to gouge the public.  His promises re coal's return will not pan out either.
3115 2018-01-23 18:05:46 History wins you nothing. Oil money? Surely being debt free and turning over a profit is better than 500 million of debt in loans secured against the club. Glazers have played a blinder. Compulsory purchase scheme? Should be illegal!! Morally wrong

3117 2018-01-23 18:05:42 Oil rose more than 1% on Tuesday, w/ benchmark Brent crude hitting $70 a barrel for the 1st time in a week, boosted by healthy world economic growth prospects & expectations for continued production curbs by OPEC, Russia & their allies #Oil #business #markets #brent

3119 2018-01-23 18:05:35 I actually sorta kinda have a YA book written about the oil crisis. I need to revise it after I finish my contracted book. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT KEEPS STAYING RELEVANT.

3125 2018-01-23 18:04:57 #TrumpTariffs on imported solar panels is a huge gift to the oil industry. They import oil from around the world every second. And even get subsidies from American tax payers to do it. They are getting paid to kill our planet. The time to switch to clean energy is right now.

3129 2018-01-23 18:04:22 That pretty much sums it up! Ole’ Chucky has a habit of pulling stunts like this and then sticks his finger in the air to see which way the wind blows! Americans were not buying his snake oil this time!

3133 2018-01-23 18:04:00 Angolan state oil firm Sonangol has issued its 1st public tender to buy refined products to widen its import base, market sources who have seen the tender said = sign the country is committed to reforming its oil industry #Oil #Angola
3134 2018-01-23 18:03:39 Maybe we should outsource all of Scotland’s oil & gas management to Norway to manage, That’s a lot of revenue to loose, wonder where it went?
3135 2018-01-23 18:03:27 Solar power industry is responsible for employing more than twice the number of people working coal and oil in the US. There's no mystery why Dotard would choose to do this.
3136 2018-01-23 18:03:21 He likes to tweet on shooters of color. He hates Alaska, but he likes the oil. Trump is wrong on many fronts.
3137 2018-01-23 18:03:21 Come get an oil change and get a free wash and vacuum too
3138 2018-01-23 18:03:19 Almost every foundation has water. Even oil/silicone derivative based foundations. Water evaporates off. Ur bases need to match or u could get pilling. If u use a silicone primer & MAC Face & Body it will “slip” off & sit on top. Water can’t get thro the silicone. Won’t last long
3139 2018-01-23 18:03:17 I think it's you, who didn't get the memo. The US together with the rest of the world is running out of oil.
3140 2018-01-23 18:03:09 I’m fighting it too.  Lots of ACV throughly the day, garlic, C, and coconut oil.  Create an unfriendly environment for the virus.
3141 2018-01-23 18:03:05 Punitive would entail a proof of malicious intent. There is no such proof. As for your evidence of requiring “organizations” to follow regulation set by the state to be eligible for grants, the skies the limit from food & health services, oil & gas industry, mining, fisheries etc
3142 2018-01-23 18:02:56 Stop being a troll. There was no white genocide in Zimbabwe. Infact South Africa and Britian made sure to keep apartheid sphere of influence in southern region of Africa. They bombed ports, roads, oil line and cut off access to Indian Ocean.
3143 2018-01-23 18:02:52 DATING TIP: display poetic yet down to earth realism in your everyday naming. Try ‘ocean scabs’ for sea salt, ‘milk oil’ for butter, ‘my old house’ for your mum.
3144 2018-01-23 18:02:50 Creamed coconut oil
3145 2018-01-23 18:02:50 I even created a very good dosing system. Instead of just throwing some #weed into a pot of oil, I weighed my ingredients. Both oil and weed. So I knew something like .25 g of oil was right on the edge of too much. And I could repeat it. Instead of just guessing and hoping.
3146 2018-01-23 18:02:34 that madafocking oil
3147 2018-01-23 18:02:32 @Jeep @Chrysler just brought my Jeep in for another oil consumption test.  Despite being 1 1/4 quarts low they can’t do anything cause that’s “acceptable loss” in 2017 filling oil at least twice between changes  is not acceptable first and last Jeep I buy.
3148 2018-01-23 18:02:26 I strayed away from putting in shadow and especially liner because it’s just really difficult to get off and you can’t use oil based removers which is what I use.
3149 2018-01-23 18:02:25 Oh, so Blair & Campbell are stand up guys now? Both him and Campbell took the UK into an illegal war, fighting for nothing but oil & regime change at the behest of Bush. Our brave soldiers, fighting & dying for absolutely nothing to do with us.
3150 2018-01-23 18:02:22 Thanks for the mention! TheCarterCrowd: @MamaKautz That's a name of an oil? Sorry, I'm new to this area.
3151 2018-01-23 18:02:18 Trump is a supporter of oil, solar is the competition.

3171 2018-01-23 18:01:15 My question is whether this violates Obama-era sanctions placed against Congolese officials. And if MER in power systems, that smells funny to me. Power needs oil/coal/gas/solar to run. And we know Ru/China/Trump/Rex deals/conspiracy come down to oil/gas
3172 2018-01-23 18:01:09 Faith and fear are like oil and water. Faith trumps fear!
3173 2018-01-23 18:01:03 It’s also a discouragement of clean and renewable energy at a time when we are increasingly faced with the effects of global warming from the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil. Thanks for nothing, Trump.
3174 2018-01-23 18:01:02 they are getting me my bulb meow and oil change stuff
3175 2018-01-23 18:00:56 You know when I was a kid I always wanted on a primal level to eat shit that I wasn't sposed to but the higher functioning parts of my brain were like wtf is wrong with you, so I ain't never actually chugged oil or ate pills or whatever
3176 2018-01-23 18:00:47 @realDonaldTrump nice solar tariff you piece of shit. You don’t care about the 23,000 American jobs or investment in solar power that are going to be lost because of this. Just what big oil lobbyists are lining your reelection fund’s pockets with. Fuck you.
3177 2018-01-23 18:00:43 Your oil diffuser??  I’m glad you like it!
3178 2018-01-23 18:00:43 Way to go @realDonaldTrump ! Coal and oil Industries must come first. Don't do anything to benefit the environment! #Solar is a threat to your donors. We will just move to Planet #Trump. The Jackass of Mar-A-Largo strikes again!
3179 2018-01-23 18:00:41 Trump has big investment and donors/investors in oil. Are you surprised Tax Reduction bill disproportionately helps big oil, are you further surprised that Trump is trying to kill off solar industry

3186 2018-01-23 17:59:41 That China will be first through the gate is a given. They have a vast headstart, and nothing like the oil lobby or local governmental concerns to hold them up. Sometime soon China will be the #1 global free-energy leader. They will use that gain to destroy other's economies.
3187 2018-01-23 17:59:40 anyway i bought a bandana so i guess i'm an oil tycoon now
3188 2018-01-23 17:59:32 Dude legit have you tried tea tree oil ? It's helped me so much !
3189 2018-01-23 17:59:25 Not convinced of physical rather than financial oil demand once products are considered. Saudi capacity to export products & weakness of crack spreads are factors here. I see fair price as $45/$55 at best. I can't see China putting up with >$60 oil for long

3200 2018-01-23 17:58:24 You don't need oil to pan toast bread. It does not stick. I agree w/ efficiency since both sides get toasted at once. It still seems like a lot of mechanics for just one slice of toast.

3210 2018-01-23 17:57:12 As a solar company, we are devastated to learn Trump has imposed a 30% tariff on solar panels virtually killing the solar industry. Solar employs more people than coal and oil combined. today's decision will cause the loss of roughly 23,000 American jobs this year.
3211 2018-01-23 17:57:08 SOOO the constitution is being dipped in Saudi oil and the burned
3212 2018-01-23 17:57:08 Probably. But you can't guard your oil, mineral and poppy-field interests with hope. Not to mention its lack of traction for rallying the base, or getting appropriations in Congress.
3213 2018-01-23 17:57:01 Yeah, get a spray bottle and add two parts jojoba and almond oil and about 15-20 tea tree drops and 15-20 drops of peppermint or sweet orange oil for a pleasant smell, you can use that as a daily moisturizer for her scalp...
3214 2018-01-23 17:56:57 Honestly I'm so stressed out with Malaysia's economy bcs my parents both aren't working and we rely on the money from our oil plantation. If EU really does boycott cooking oil from Asia, then chances are I won't even be able to do my degree let alone do my masters n PhD

3234 2018-01-23 17:55:21 I don't see this as political intrigue just sensible energy use policy - better economically & environmentally to run power plants on natgas than fuel oil
3235 2018-01-23 17:55:10 I’m still not sure why we can’t look at the Energy Sector as a whole unit of composite parts. My province of Alberta does this too. Why hate on Solar jobs because Oil and Gas is our primary export? It can supplement and eventually replace, and we can keep leading in the space.

3274 2018-01-23 17:51:06 I think the bougie-ist thing about me is my obsession with coconut oil and the only jeans I will spend $40 on are Levi
3275 2018-01-23 17:51:02 I find it extremely difficult to find any value whatsoever in an American dollar.  Their military always loses to us in war games, and I don't need much oil.   Where's the value in this?
3276 2018-01-23 17:50:59 Course it is, REALsocialists give oil freely to anyone who needs it. (They have a magical insight into who really needs what.)

3286 2018-01-23 17:50:05 It’s okay but it’s not the best, for the most part Coconut oil is a good carrier oil but I would recommend adding jojoba and almond oil to the mixture, it actually adds moisture, coconut oil is meant for wet hair, not a daily regimen

3289 2018-01-23 17:49:36 i guarantee it’ll only damage in the long run :-( not even from a “some things work for others” perspective, coconut oil is really fatty and contains a lot of stuff that just shouldn’t go on ur skin!! it’s actually one of the highest scoring comedogenic oils

3300 2018-01-23 17:48:37 We couldn't agree more! All that lovely sea salt, citrus juice, and coconut oil, never fail to leave your skin refreshed and smooth. Thank you for sharing the love, Shawn! 
3301 2018-01-23 17:48:37 Want to scare the Russians? Start saying things like "renewable energy." 

Just about 47%+ of Russia's exports are Crude Oil, Natural Gas and Minerals. When we don't need those things, what industry is left?
3302 2018-01-23 17:48:29 hahaha and the solution is to raise taxes, social engineering and elect more crazy people to govt such as crazy Bernie etc.
50 years and oil will be gone who you will blame ?? not the mighty one

3343 2018-01-23 17:44:53 CASTOR OIL REALLY IS THAT BITCH
3344 2018-01-23 17:44:42 I mean, this article itself clearly shows a basic lack of understanding of socialism. The fact that it talks about the fact that the collapse in oil prices caused the Venezuelan economy to collapse is proof enough that it wasn’t ‘real’ socialism (whatever ‘real’ socialism is)
3345 2018-01-23 17:44:33 He probably doesn’t have friends in the solar industry. Now the business can go to his cronies in oil. It’s what’s best for 45, not the country.

3370 2018-01-23 17:41:47 @MADDOW So now tRump has to PROVE he is right by forcing renewable Energy options to fail with HUGE tarrifs on Solar?!
Is he afraid the industry will PROVE he's an uneducated Moron by supporting Coal/Oil instead of fully renewable Solar/Wind etc?

3410 2018-01-23 17:37:22 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
3411 2018-01-23 17:37:21 New laptop ordered!  Daddy wasn't sure I should get the protection plan on it for 4 years for $135. Then he thought better of it because he's pretty sure I'll "wind up doing something dumb." He's very likely to be right. Hehe  I killed the last one with my boobs and oil. 
3412 2018-01-23 17:37:05 Ah yes, our friends the Saudi government - pretty much as bad as the people we’ve gone to war against, but all that lovely lovely oil.
3413 2018-01-23 17:37:02 It's always a weird feeling going back to work the day after something like yesterday happened in the oil field. Everyone stay safe!
3414 2018-01-23 17:37:01 Sir, can we also look at funding research on creating fuels from cow dung/waste which can reduce dependence on LPG which again linked to international oil&Gas market
3415 2018-01-23 17:36:48 just figured out a #protip: rub a little lavender oil on your upper lip for immediate stress/anxiety relief
3416 2018-01-23 17:36:47 Oil give it foive
3417 2018-01-23 17:36:44 Exactly. Baba is the democratic ideal. A man of integrity. Foreign reserves is now over $40b. He has stabilized oil prices and employed thousands of youths in the N-Power program. Baba till 2023.
3418 2018-01-23 17:36:43 4 likely lads you should be on stage give up the oil Radio and T V

3421 2018-01-23 17:36:12 They can get jobs cleaning up all the future oil spills and pipeline leaks instead
3422 2018-01-23 17:36:08 In Albania and Greece I’ve witnessed everyone sunbathing with olive oil, putting it on their skin for moisture, their hair, cook with it, etc. I feel like just now the US has started to really use these oils for these things..
3423 2018-01-23 17:35:59 turn off the electronics early before you go to bed, at least an hour before you want to sleep. Make sure your room is dark. Playing ambient sounds can help. Lavender oil is a natural remedy that doesn't make you sleep and isn't oral that just relaxes you. You can also try deep >
3424 2018-01-23 17:35:51 Landlord needs to upgrade the hallway air tech. No problem on the cooking oil fumes & all the other hazards coming from the street? How far down the list below the grill smoke is #cannabis without the media slang?
3425 2018-01-23 17:35:47 And I still need to get my lights fixed oil change n a new bumper 
3426 2018-01-23 17:35:46 but oil company and Country go bank corrupt #PMModiAtDavos
3427 2018-01-23 17:35:38 so hear me out 

let's say you take chicken, and you cook it, not in water, but at the same temperature, in say, Oil.
3428 2018-01-23 17:35:28 #Venezuela should: 1) unify its currency exchange rate; 2) float its currency; 3) stop being so reliant on oil. @venanalysis
3429 2018-01-23 17:35:25 Some cats may or may not like the "Unrefined" Coconut Oil that actually smells like Coconut. Mom bought some for me...& I won't eat it.
3430 2018-01-23 17:35:23 Interesting comment by Qatar oil minister (that others at #OPEC don't make): "U.S. shale is proving to be a swing producer". (Obviously, depends of your definition of swing). #Davos #Davos2018 #OOTT #oil #shale
3431 2018-01-23 17:35:23 @realDonaldTrump How about these American jobs? At least your oil & gas buddies will get richer.
3432 2018-01-23 17:35:20 Atleast you know you are a psychopath . Gotta start pouring anointing oil on you when you sleep 
3433 2018-01-23 17:35:14 Yeah oil change! #justadultthings
3434 2018-01-23 17:35:10 RUB U DOWN IN BABY OIL NOW U SHINY LIKE A DIAMOND 
3435 2018-01-23 17:35:04 People from the other Caribbean islands were imported back in the beginning of the 19th century when Oil refining and mining started in Aruba. They also bought Carnival to Aruba.
3436 2018-01-23 17:35:01 Just like he stopped Carrier refrigeration layoffs or made Keystone oil pipeline 100% American or stopped China manipulating currency, or made Mexico pay a wall or gave us  affordable, cheaper healthcare, or put Hillary in jail" or served in the military (while dishonoring a POW)
3437 2018-01-23 17:35:01 Update: got free oil change, tire rotation, car wash, & vacuum 
3438 2018-01-23 17:35:00 I guess when they put oil in the pan while it’s preheating for the edges but I thought that was a must 
3439 2018-01-23 17:34:54 And it's a big boon for Tillerson's oil buddies!
3440 2018-01-23 17:34:44 Try mint (spearmint or peppermint) essential oil with coconut oil. It will cool down your footsies.
3441 2018-01-23 17:34:41 It’s almost like an oil but you can use it as a primer is it gets thick when it dries or just use it before bed for glowing skin.
3442 2018-01-23 17:34:41 Would've been a good idea to build dams in this area (between the ocean and the first line of mountain ranges) and supply the peninsula via pipeline. If pipelines can be built to transfer oil 5000km+ then surely it can be done for water across 200km...
3443 2018-01-23 17:34:36 Dibilang bukan ga percaya
3444 2018-01-23 17:34:33 vape oil. Please I must see
3445 2018-01-23 17:34:29 I could use an oil change 
3446 2018-01-23 17:34:19 OIL DIFF: 5.41 -> 5.46
3447 2018-01-23 17:34:07 Well, having solar panels can make you at least to a degree energy independant, oil companies get rich on our dependance. Maybe there is a future where we don't have to make a bunch of rich people more rich in order to maintain our livestiles.
3448 2018-01-23 17:33:54 What's your favourite skincare oil? Share your top tips! #skincare #oil
3449 2018-01-23 17:33:52 My USB oil diffuser won't turn off. Hope the people in this class sitting near me feel real mellow; this is also my fave blend, so the jabronies better fucking appreciate it.
3450 2018-01-23 17:33:51 Tipe kulit aku combi to oily 
kalau alergi kacang kacangan sih kayaknya ga ada..berarti harus fokus ke salah satu oil dulu ya?
3451 2018-01-23 17:33:48 @nationalgridus the gas coming from my stove burners smells like lamp oil. Is there a new additive in it? I live in Lowell Massachusetts
3452 2018-01-23 17:33:48 What about the Gulf States and the Germans. Send back the refugees to rebuild their country with Gulf oil money. Win Win.
3453 2018-01-23 17:33:47 Savita Oil Technologies has fixed 'Record Date' as February 9 for the purpose of buyback of shares.
3454 2018-01-23 17:33:46 I usually partially activate my kief, for two reasons. 
1. Partially activated cannabis has a lot of CBG available, I mix it with coconut oil, add to a cup of coffee and no tummy pain.
2. It fully activates if you're cooking in the oven for 20 min or less and knock ya down.
3455 2018-01-23 17:33:46 Yes. But we all have hidden damage too. We are like used cars. Some put on a paint job and turn back the odometer. It's hard to know if one had routine oil changes and regular maintenance.

Dr. Sam Shelton
Dr. Richard A. Simmons
This module introduces the concepts of impact of energy issues on society, sources of energy, role of fossil fuels and issues of oil import
3457 2018-01-23 17:33:29 “Looks like you got yourself in some hot oil” 
Brilliant.
3458 2018-01-23 17:33:28 Background: Comes from Edo period hair oil salesmen who took their time chitchatting with the customers when selling.
3459 2018-01-23 17:33:25 With current high crude oil price. It is either subsidy in whatever form or fuel hike. The latter detrimental to the govt.
3460 2018-01-23 17:33:09 (to the tone of time to oil up)
Time to.....
Grow up
3461 2018-01-23 17:33:08 How about approving 12K miles of oil pipelines
3462 2018-01-23 17:33:05 Stuff like this, BP oil spill,some vehicle recalls, is why that corporate veil should be lifted. Put execs in jail,don't just fine companies
3463 2018-01-23 17:33:03 This lil girl put her painting over my oil painting and smudged It I am pissed
3464 2018-01-23 17:32:58 Called to make an appointment for an oil change and the hold song was Bruno Mars - Finesse. Only time I wish I was on hold longer lol
3465 2018-01-23 17:32:57 The only thing genius about Beli-Cheat is how much he rigs his games. I've seen oil companies do less rigging.
3466 2018-01-23 17:32:44 That's all pure bull John, and you know it!  @BizRoundtable is just another Special Interest, Without our trade, our illegal aliens sending money, and our foreign aid Mexico becomes another 3rd world country w/good music.  Canada must have the US to export their oil.
3467 2018-01-23 17:32:44 Trump is trying to kill American Solar dead as a door nail, in defense of dirty #Coal, #oilandgas Oil & Gas, the tariff goes away after 4 years, nobody is going to start a solar plant that will be dead in 4 years. #FossilFuels #Tillerson #energy @RaytonSolar @RepublicanSwine
3468 2018-01-23 17:32:40 A soap consisting of water, alkali, & cassia oil was written on a Babylonian clay tablet around 2200 BC. The Ebers papyrus (Egypt, 1550 BC) indicates the ancient Egyptians bathed regularly & combined animal, vegetable oils with alkaline salts to create a soap-like substance.
3469 2018-01-23 17:32:34 Think I might let my hair down today. Needa oil my scalp anyway lol 
3470 2018-01-23 17:32:34 Lettuce wraps w/ red potatoes, yellow peppers cooked in coconut oil & turkey meat #MealPrepDays
3471 2018-01-23 17:32:30 For all its hate, & collusion, @GOP's most dangerous trait is climate change denial. Earth shouldn't end b/c Pruitt is an oil industry cog.
3472 2018-01-23 17:32:28 At all.And to be fair none of Sudanese clubs presidents/patrons are involved in oil or gas business in the country.I dunno from where this usual rumour comes from.
3473 2018-01-23 17:32:23 “Faith & doubt don’t mix, it’s like oil & water” - @CassperNyovest 
3474 2018-01-23 17:32:22 The gas and oil business is one of the best options available for investors who want to diversify their portfolio. #Investing
3475 2018-01-23 17:32:20 Ignorance isn't bliss, it's the silent chaos in waiting of an invisible wet floor sign after a good mopping attempt to clean up an oil spill in the kitchen.... also faith takes the dunning kruger effect to great heights, so with these two in mind, humanity seems doomed.
3476 2018-01-23 17:32:16 Terrible cause we have a president who’s giving tax cuts to the top 1% and oil and gas companies. If we had Bernie he wouldn’t give them tax cuts
3477 2018-01-23 17:32:13 Because oil, coal and guns apparently make America great.
'MERICA!
3478 2018-01-23 17:32:06 Oil Barons + the NRA + Russian Oligarchs + ex-GRU Chief +MBS and Saudi Royals + White Supremacists + Christian Far Right + KKK + Black Art = @POTUS is a clear and present danger to Mother Earth #antichrist #666 @Shafeea_Z
3479 2018-01-23 17:31:59 No money he can make from oil or guns so he won't push getting his so called Texans help.
3480 2018-01-23 17:31:56 KRILL OIL EXISTS AND IT'S TAKING FOOD AWAY FROM THE WHALES
3481 2018-01-23 17:31:54 Yes! Invest in renewable energy and new technology. Coal and oil are on the way out. Look at China and Europe.  The USA,....back to the 50’s.
3482 2018-01-23 17:31:52 >Be JD Rockefeller
>Have majority stake in Standard Oil
>Control the majority of Global Oil Economy
>People get mad
>Eventually forced to dissolve company by Sup Court
>Make even more money by selling skyrocketing assets
>Now hold 2% of American GDP
>Now it's time to get started
3483 2018-01-23 17:31:44 Alaskans own 312,097 shares of JOHN WOOD GROUP PLC, worth $2,967,940. It's from the OIL SERVICES sector, based in UNITED KINGDOM.
3484 2018-01-23 17:31:38 People pray for the cake. Then God gives them the butter, flour, eggs, oil, icing, a pan, an oven, but they get frustrated and leave the kitchen.

Let that sink in. Sometimes you have everything right in front of you, but how bad do you want it?
3485 2018-01-23 17:31:11 Do you mind telling me what is oil pulling?
3486 2018-01-23 17:30:57 The tariff is just Drumpf trying to tank the solar industry for the benefit of Big Oil!
3487 2018-01-23 17:30:56 Fact Alert: Oil is already near historic lows.
3488 2018-01-23 17:30:56 Eugene Wilkie 
@NOW1SOLAR
As a solar company, we are devastated to learn Trump has imposed a 30% tariff on solar panels virtually killing the solar industry. Solar employs more people than coal and oil combined.
3489 2018-01-23 17:30:41 Texas will lose BILLIONS if NAFTA is repealed. We actually don't live on gas &oil alone.
3490 2018-01-23 17:30:38 así es el electorado, prepárense para seis años de pleito y atraso
3491 2018-01-23 17:30:31 People, in general, are in shock I have a 14 yr old Staffie. He's still playing with his teddy's, going for walks, eating & drinking. He gets cod lover oil capsules, tuna, dentistix and jointstix. I've cut his walks down, but he could go for miles!!!! Go Floyd!!
3492 2018-01-23 17:30:18 no amount of dry shampoo will cover the coconut oil drenched mess that is my hair, and all before work. Fabulous.
3493 2018-01-23 17:30:15 Seronok tengok orang share skincare routine dorang. Sayang aku kerja bahagian kitchen, banyak main dgn heat & oil, oven, dapur.... 
3494 2018-01-23 17:30:11 Khan sahb plz also talk about, terrorism, un employment, Oil prices, n things which directly effect the poor people, otherwise Sharif  mafia will again come into power, bcoz a lay man haven't any concern with corruption.also do work in rural areas.plz Focus on 2018 election
3495 2018-01-23 17:30:01 "the spirit of wife" sounds like those oil perfumes people sell on the side of the street.
3496 2018-01-23 17:29:54 Try coconut oil
3497 2018-01-23 17:29:48 As Turkey Invades, Kurds See Betrayal Once Again by the United States- Twice in less than 1 year is a pretty sad US State of Affairs. Of course it is all about OIL and WATER in the region when it comes to the Kurds. Greedy White House I guess.
3498 2018-01-23 17:29:40 @NYCMayor 
Dear ALL oil companies,
The mayor is right. Please suspend the sale of all products and services to the NYC metropolitan area effective immediately. You cannot be the source of this problem anymore.

Sino empieza a ver gas oil barato,pocas rapiñas y robos,buena educación y defender a sendic, capaz manda sacar boletos de avión en ALAS U, ve petróleo, funcionando la regasificadora  Y el puerto de aguas profundas etc es por su bien!!!
3502 2018-01-23 17:29:12 Oil money
3503 2018-01-23 17:28:55 Tipe kulit kamu apa? Kemungkinan kamu ga cocok dari salah satu oil itu, ada alergi kacang-kacangan kah? Kalau kulit kamu oily jangan terlalu banyak layer oil coba concern ke salah satu problem misal jerawat dulu kalau udah hilang baru concern ke dark spotnya
3504 2018-01-23 17:28:53 How am I supposed to get a job when I can’t even get a call back about an appointment for an oil change???
3505 2018-01-23 17:28:50 Cold sores suck! L-lysine, tea tree oil and/or medicated carmex
3506 2018-01-23 17:28:48 #TuesdayTeaser I have a test container of mocha body butter setting in the fridge. It's just like the one you already love, but made w/coffee-infused shea butter, coffee-infused coconut oil, & chocolate extract. Sounds #Delicious, doesn't it?  #TweetMariese #SimpleCleanNatural
3507 2018-01-23 17:28:48 Would have love to dump a good amount of meds but it costs 200 for a license for MMJ and then 200 to see the Dr and then you still have to buy it and in pa its only oil.  They Can't Even Get That Right.
3508 2018-01-23 17:28:34 Can't argue with poor returns on trades being a self-inflicted wound. It's definitely implicated in this horrendous half season.
3509 2018-01-23 17:28:25 What a MISLEADING "news" article. 

There is NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER that ANY of the recent Oil & Gas EXPLOITATION has gone anywhere BUT ASIA and the CARIBBEAN. So to assert that it is- or will be- in furtherance of the nation's energy needs is just a FLAT OUT LIE.
3510 2018-01-23 17:28:17 Good point. Image if that possible tsunami today had occurred wiping out 3 or 4 oil rigs. It would be Deepwater Horizon times 4.
3511 2018-01-23 17:28:06 めちゃくちゃによんでよ…（？
えーもうほんとすごかった　いっぱい描きこんであってえらいしかっこよかったです　感想書いてる最中に興奮しすぎて企画垢の方でつぶやいたけどうりきれてんだわこれ…　煉獄さんありがとう……これマジデ同人誌…（？？？
3512 2018-01-23 17:28:03 Let’s see major oil can survive without corporate welfare solar energy can’t pluscthe left keeps telling us tariffs should be on everything
3513 2018-01-23 17:28:00 You should know. If not ask Merrick Garland, or snake oil @tedcruz about 2013. #TrumpShutdown
3514 2018-01-23 17:27:58 Free electricity... or 6-8 cents per kw more expensive than gas / oil/ coal
3515 2018-01-23 17:27:48 Does this include the company that sold out oil and gold reserves at an all time low? Gunna disband already?
3516 2018-01-23 17:27:45 People who say oil and water don't mix have never made Belgian waffles for people they love :)
3517 2018-01-23 17:27:32 It would be beautiful chaos. Like when the little dude in Stand By Me sat back and marveled at the barf o rama in tent he created drinking caster oil.
3518 2018-01-23 17:27:29 Yeah it's just the oil from your hand over time. I always buy dark controllers now because my white scuf used to turn brown
3519 2018-01-23 17:27:25 Four years into being totally offgrid, it's quite strange listening to people talk about smart meters, oil & gas price hikes, water charges. Ok we have some adjustments to make,  but we can 'never' be held to ransome by greedy corporations. We won!!!!
3520 2018-01-23 17:27:14 Oil subsidies get 70 times more allocation than renewables. If we had put the same determination that was put in oil economy from drilling to infrastructure, we would‘ve already cut the cost of energy much more with zero emissions in 21st century with surplus in electric power.
3521 2018-01-23 17:27:05 Box alarm North Reading Ma, box 315 290 Main St, oil truck fire, no extension to bld, Eng-2 running attack line
3522 2018-01-23 17:27:01 Toner changed my life. More specifically the @OleHenriksen balancing force oil control toner
3523 2018-01-23 17:26:28 Gulf Oil did more than dabble in fuel. 

They participated in the Uranium Club [Cartel]. Targeted Westinghouse. Successfully caught circle W (a Pittsburg neighbor) in a short squeeze. Distracted W top management for more than a decade. Employed armies of lawyers
3524 2018-01-23 17:26:20 Sitting on the largest oil reserves in the world, with the worlds largest consumer & economy almost on its doorstep. Yet it’s people are literally starving to death. Round of applause for the socialists 
3525 2018-01-23 17:26:18 Yes because the BP oil rig spill in the Gulf of Mexico was good for the economy
3526 2018-01-23 17:26:15 For myself yes. I have oily to combination skin and I noticed a severe difference when added to my routine. I feel my castor oil absorbs better after the washing/toner.
3527 2018-01-23 17:26:12 Fucking Trump... Why invest in clean energy when you can already do all the dirty things you want to do when you're in bed with Big Coal and Big Oil?
3528 2018-01-23 17:26:10 I’m guessing the oil industry “had a word”
3529 2018-01-23 17:26:04 Trump supporters: now we don't have to buy foreign oil
3530 2018-01-23 17:26:03 I think the wick deal is they can't hve oil 4 lamplight from wick bc they need a bath 1st. We hve the word,we hve a wick, no fuel &they stick 2 high heaven. Kasie &rest get a bath n HIS name u reek.
3531 2018-01-23 17:26:01 Never ever ever buy a @knfilters oil filter. Almost blew my truck up because of their shitty product
3532 2018-01-23 17:25:58 Yes... let's find and burn more oil instead of directing our efforts towards alternative ways of energy. Perfect for a growing climate change issue and better chances of destroying our shorelines. GOP>>> Greed Over People
3533 2018-01-23 17:25:52 Goes to show, you can't trust a snake oil salesman. Schumer is a hack.
3534 2018-01-23 17:25:44 For him it is a double whammy-taking on Chines imports and screwing the the Solar industry for his buddies int the oil and coal business.  The real losers-consumers!
3535 2018-01-23 17:25:29 lol have you heard of this shit? Growers spraying the fuck out of their shit with neem oil is causing some to get sick. Doctors are blaming cannabis.
3536 2018-01-23 17:25:22 Again, they gave away core pieces & didn't improve the team...that's bad business & it will make this climb all the more difficult.
3537 2018-01-23 17:25:13 Trump: giving children of the future fun filled beach days with dirty oily water & sand, while looking at oil rigs & dead fish.  .

3540 2018-01-23 17:25:07 It cuts into his plans to make America gush oil again  oh.. and then there's the 'clean coal' he's trying to promote
3541 2018-01-23 17:25:02 I’d love for other countries to subsidize our energy independence, too! But, yes, the rules got altered for “green.” The US tariff schedule for oil & gas field materials & machinery = FREE.

3549 2018-01-23 17:24:16 Im actually so dumb how did i just spray my dinner with anti bacterial surface cleaner instead of cooking oil
3550 2018-01-23 17:24:13 Diuble cleanse with an oil based cleanse better
3551 2018-01-23 17:24:12 Can we talk about how I just spent $550 for and oil change/smog and car registration..... 
3552 2018-01-23 17:24:12 I smell like motor oil, but that's what you get when your classwork involves engines
3553 2018-01-23 17:24:09 Damn. Didn't know memes had a shelf life under a few weeks. We'll have to burn that midnight oil if we're gonna survive.

Or... you know... just ignore it.
3554 2018-01-23 17:24:06 @AGBecerra you want to be Governor, Senator , President? Then step up with California cities and sue big oil over climate change damage to our great state or we will haunt you every day of your political career

3560 2018-01-23 17:23:35 but yeah, I certainly don't want Chiarelli pulling any more triggers on core pieces.
3561 2018-01-23 17:23:30 Here's a thing & just putting it out there, these petrol stations instead of selling crisps, biscuits and fizzy drinks how about selling car associated things like fucking oil
3562 2018-01-23 17:23:29 Yummo! I use 73u gentleman’s Kief for everything. Sometimes decarboxylated already sometimes not, I’ll let the food prep do it for me. Cold items I’ll either RSO it to an oil, or melt it into some butter or oil. And only Golden or blonde. No chlorophyll thank you. Yucky tastes.
3563 2018-01-23 17:23:28 I liked how the woca oil didn't make the heart pine darker.
3564 2018-01-23 17:23:24 There has to be a way to convince #republicans that #oil revenues are not a sufficient tradeoff for destroying coastal ecosystems. I'm starting to think this is a cultural issue; do these CEO's even know where their oysters, lobsters, and swordfish come from?
3565 2018-01-23 17:23:21 Mohan meeda acne perigipothondi .. Someone please suggest 100% working home made pack or something like tea tree oil. TIA
3566 2018-01-23 17:23:13 it has not become politically incorrect, its the only ethical choice
3567 2018-01-23 17:23:07 the old policy created dependence on foreign oil.
3568 2018-01-23 17:23:05 7.9 in the Gulf of Alaska this morning. But what the hell, we can siphon the oil off the top and still sell it right?
3569 2018-01-23 17:23:02 Real estate is crazy. Everyone needs a home. The US does not value homes. They're seen more as financial instruments and obstacles to awesome things like leaky oil pipelines and strip malls.
3570 2018-01-23 17:22:46 Mate, without oil money you would be in Championship
3571 2018-01-23 17:22:26 We need to build economy outside oil. By 2050 our human population will surpass that of US. We will have Labour force which might be idle. Let us fix power, fix internal security, attract manufacturing investors, grow our gdp  and  a welfare state. Now is the time!
3572 2018-01-23 17:22:24 Yes, the Eberle return was dog shit and the team should have gotten more for Taylor Hall, but I reject the idea that this team is thin on talent and cannot replace what went out the door with Eberle/Hall. The cap is going up, and there are many promising young players inside.
3573 2018-01-23 17:22:23 Hunnigan, could you check and see if the BSAA has any units near the oil field?
3574 2018-01-23 17:22:22 Could it BE MORE OBVIOUS that Trump’s loyalty lies with Russia and continues to push forward his agenda to keep oil as King. He is a traitor and needs to be IMPEACHED. #crookedtrump #LOCKHIMUP
3575 2018-01-23 17:22:22 The #PersianGulf endgame is very hard to call. Risk analysts disagree. Fate of #Saudi #MbS unclear but it may be that #Iran threat helps him. Rival theocracy in #Israel, #Iran, #Saudi & a more nationalistic #Kurds vs #Turkey = confrontation is coming.  #Shia sit on ALL the oil.
3576 2018-01-23 17:22:19 Oil change and chill
3577 2018-01-23 17:22:16 You smell a jugular to be its olive oil across a mint more than a beak down his sod.
3578 2018-01-23 17:22:12 Organic Coconut Oil -Please!
3579 2018-01-23 17:22:05 Gotta change my oil today & Check the brakes.
Hope the garage not full.
3580 2018-01-23 17:22:02 Wind dies. 
Sun sets. 
But oil will last forever, am I right guys? 

BTW, that's sarcasm.
3581 2018-01-23 17:22:01 Trump throws a tarrif on solar energy equipment the week after he opens open our coasts for oil drilling. It's obvious he's getting his advice (and money) from big oil.
3582 2018-01-23 17:21:58 Already short oil (w $sco) against my energy names and going start scale short $ung via $dgaz.
3583 2018-01-23 17:21:49 These silly Americans have built an economy where they only pump oil when it’s worth it.
3584 2018-01-23 17:21:48 I cannot believe our own allies tried to switch on us! The #SuezCrisis is no excuse to gain control over the Suez Canal. You know what? No more oil for you guys!
3585 2018-01-23 17:21:43 Pass a tax ...  quit using oil .... oh wait, a tax wouldn't do anything and millions could die without carbon energy? OK, never mind
3586 2018-01-23 17:21:35 Yeah, I was sitting at Walmart getting my oil changed when I sent that... $56.69
3587 2018-01-23 17:21:30 When a disasterous accident/explosion happens on an oil well, and they release the names... one of whom has the same name, AND AGE, as someone you've been friends with since you were 10, and don't keep in touch with. Phew, it wasn't him.
3588 2018-01-23 17:21:20 is she using #hemp oil (which is federally legal I believe) or the stuff from #cannabis/#marijuana?
3589 2018-01-23 17:21:17 More Hey i made of our water and i love crushing up 200,000 gallon oil spill on repeat until i will wear capes.

3591 2018-01-23 17:20:45 Economy:his inaction saw our economy slip into recession,now we’re out of it and gradually growing which is aided by high oil prices but we’re gradually making old mistakes,like reintroduction of subsidy & the Many social programs we have that are unsustainable
3592 2018-01-23 17:20:39 You could .....but big oil wouldn’t like it
3593 2018-01-23 17:20:35 مايقطع المطر غير الحسد والغل في مثل يقول ديار الفسد ولا ديار الحسد
3594 2018-01-23 17:20:33 Sure, but the team had already turned it around and Duchene was not a big part of it. In terms of it's relationship to the Avs turnaround, I think a new coaching regime was much more important to repairing what was a toxic work environment from everything I read.
3595 2018-01-23 17:20:29 piden solo que suba el dolar mínimo a 36 pesos,el gas oil a 31.que se saquen las ayudas sociales,que se pueda manejar en pedo y los de la cámara de inmobiliarias seguro que no quieren que los controlen tanto por que si no pueden lavar dinero...
3596 2018-01-23 17:20:24 It makes sense if you get a paycheck by the oil indistry to do so...
3597 2018-01-23 17:20:19 Muh nature! Just think, there is a sea algae now that eats oil. How awesome is that?
3598 2018-01-23 17:19:58 「かおがいい」「これ原作」
3599 2018-01-23 17:19:54 Like when we dumped hall?
3600 2018-01-23 17:19:45 Incredibly short-sighted by Trump (as usual). This move stifles research/innovation and could cost 20k+ US jobs, all so Trump can keep pandering to his backwards base on oil & coal.
3601 2018-01-23 17:19:20 He is in bed with big Oil Companies! Coal he just wanted their votes!
3602 2018-01-23 17:19:19 Oil!
3603 2018-01-23 17:19:18 Can't wait to move out, because I can decorate my own house ahh

3607 2018-01-23 17:19:02 All comes back to not panicking and giving away assets without addressing an actual need. This is still salvageable b/c of 97 but the ask has become far more difficult.

3610 2018-01-23 17:18:50 Soon, tickets to the #Energiewende meltdown will command more dollars than those to the NYC oil shutdown. Hmmm...
3611 2018-01-23 17:18:45 By 2030  China  economy will be bigger than US economy and by 2050 Indian economy will be bigger than US economy. By 2050, Nigerian population will be bigger than US. What does this tell You? We need to proactively build economy outside oil so we can manage the human explosion.
3612 2018-01-23 17:18:32 I don't see any need for MCTs (or exogenous ketones) on a healthy diet. 

I'm not a huge fan of coconut, either. Look at my picture, do you think my ancestors ate a high-coconut diet? 

I do use coconut oil for cooking sometimes, but mostly butter.
3613 2018-01-23 17:18:07 We are in a RACE TO THE BOTTOM in order to save the patriarchal, testosterone fueled, earth-raping, corrupt oil and gas energy. We suck so hard.
3614 2018-01-23 17:18:05 @narendramodi Modiji- cut taxes on oil; how long common man will suffer with high fuel costs ? Increasing our burden and think we are doing welll doesn’t fare well for any of us.
3615 2018-01-23 17:18:05 I need oil change breaks and tires 
3616 2018-01-23 17:17:58 Anyone else get out of bed to shower, exfoliate, oil, and lotion themselves just to get back into bed? Or?
3617 2018-01-23 17:17:57 City's top lawyer says the close timing of suits against oil companies and pharmaceutical companies was basically a coincidence.
3618 2018-01-23 17:17:42 Took my car in for an oil change and now it needs a whole new transmission. It’s only a year old & I can’t drive a rental car because I’m not 21  Happy Tuesday.
3619 2018-01-23 17:17:39 It really is terrible RT @VenusFlyTrpNoir: Coconut oil isn’t for my skin or hair, honestly
3620 2018-01-23 17:17:27 What!! Show me a pic ... I actually like it but I need an new oil cleanser I ran out of my second bottle of my 9to5 
Also this bottle of garnier will be my last because Im going cruelty free, i'll try the simple one jackie aina always raves about
3621 2018-01-23 17:17:24 Surely I'm not the only one who keeps a bottle of olive oil in the office, just in case.  But maybe it's more unusual than it should be . . .

3623 2018-01-23 17:17:19 I really hope they change my oil super fast. I don’t want to be there all day
3624 2018-01-23 17:17:17 gosh infusing weed into (anything) coco oil is so tedious, especially since I don't have the proper equipment... doing it bain marie style, I have to keep it around  70°c during 12 hours; it's been only one hour and I already wanna give up
3625 2018-01-23 17:17:03 I know right! CBS did a segment here in the Bay Area a couple mos ago on the treatment of Dementia/Alz patients w CBD oil & it was utterly amazing! Damn gov't and all their restrictions. Med advances could b so much further along!
3626 2018-01-23 17:16:38 It obviously helps HIM and his nut-licking cronies in oil and coal #FuckTrump

3653 2018-01-23 17:14:09 I willing to bet we'll be paying more money for clean water than any tax.. anyway you'll save money by changing to alternative energy..like solar..and oil is finite resource so prices are set to sky rocket
3654 2018-01-23 17:14:07 There is no question the Oilers aren't as bad as their record suggests but the big difference between them and the Avs, is Colorado didn't trade away key pieces for a 2nd pairing D man and no longer have any movable assets to improve the roster.
3655 2018-01-23 17:13:57 Ugh i need to change my oil
3656 2018-01-23 17:13:47 i want another lush lip scrub, that bahi sweets serum, and an oil burner.

3663 2018-01-23 17:12:50 The service rep at the Nissan dealership didn’t charge me for a $40 oil change. When it was done, he quoted me $289 for a service that my car needs or it might kill me.

I really thought I had won for once.

3669 2018-01-23 17:11:53 Here's the thing though, buy yourself a can and you get the oil to do whatever you want with! I keep a tiny tupperwear container of the anchovies and their oil in the fridge at all times for cooking and eating.
3670 2018-01-23 17:11:51 Right  I put oil down first then acrylic and it’s trash

Respected Union Oil Resource Ministerji. Sir I am very sorry to write this letter to you. It's an inevitable for us in Karnataka. We are not getting the gas cylinder in proper time. So it is very difficult to manage the cooking process at home. It's not only my

3685 2018-01-23 17:10:42 Just want to point out, the same may be said next year about this team.

The Avalanche have roughly the same roster as last season, and subtracted one of their under-performing star forwards, and are still much better than the season before.

3702 2018-01-23 17:08:02 But the point is not to encourage domestic production of parts for renewable energy. The point is to stick it to China while also helping out the oil industry. So much maga I can barely stand it 
3703 2018-01-23 17:07:53 If #SolarPower had half the tax, policy and financial earmarks and loopholes given to oil & gas, the industry would be triple the size (more jobs!), energy costs would be lower for everyone and the environment would be much better off. #solartariff #solarinvestment

3705 2018-01-23 17:07:47 The real issue is: Trump's policy revolves mainly arround competing in traditional industries, steel, coal oil & the likes of it.
Import tariffs are going to kill the solar industry in the USA, which employs more people than the coal business. (I can give you sources)

I know I know killing the planet... blah blah (not true) but people are working, our utility bills are going down, yay! This should be good news, but alas, liberals love anger.
3709 2018-01-23 17:07:36 How do you watch a man lie like oil to everyone on Earth and still think, "Oh, but he's telling ME the truth!"?

3719 2018-01-23 17:06:48 There are better ways to encourage production for renewables here at home rather than making imports more expensive. Maybe stop the subsidies for the oil industry (the most profitable industry in history) and provide them to domestic renewables instead. Just one better way.

3739 2018-01-23 17:05:01 Brian, back in the 70’s I didn’t a school science project on the amount of energy that the sun produces.  It was very simple.  It was prompted by the skyrocketing price of fuel.  We knew oil wasn’t sustainable.  Then the price dropped and we forgot.  No coincidence

3813 2018-01-23 16:56:42 Alternatively, one could argue that the Venezuelan #oil vanishing act has relieved a lot of “coordinating producers” from being as disciplined as they might have been.
3814 2018-01-23 16:56:24 Im not sure I would call that capitalism... but, Iran's nationalization of oil means that Iran's govt owned it, how is that good for their people, let alone any other country? You trust they would do what with the power?
3815 2018-01-23 16:56:13 Baby Oil & Coconut Oil will be applied.
3816 2018-01-23 16:56:09 Just paid down 200 on my credit card and dropped another 400 on heating oil, that #RoyalRumble window is just...about...shut. #AdultLife
3817 2018-01-23 16:56:05 I didn’t know coconut oil clogs your pores! 
3818 2018-01-23 16:56:00 Then I covered for yet ANOTHER oil win of 2017!!!!...get lost troll
3819 2018-01-23 16:55:59 Needs clarification: packed in water or oil? Solid or chunk light?
3820 2018-01-23 16:55:56 Well he has to do that to save the Koch Bros oil business if ppl install solar panels they won't need oil. The Koch org ALEC got a state to put a surcharge on solar panels she raised the price to what ppl would pay for oil heat and electricity
3821 2018-01-23 16:55:55 lmaooo nah man.. make sure you get the plant.. not no cream, or oil or water..
3822 2018-01-23 16:55:49 Sesungguhnya tea tree oil gua udah mau kadaluarsa tapi masih setengahnya lagi... dan punya gua yang ukuran botol gede :)
3823 2018-01-23 16:55:45 I just realized that in business there is never a shortage of snake oil salesmen.
3824 2018-01-23 16:55:36 Senator @SenFeinstein Please fight to keep oil drilling rigs from being built off our coast! I don't even want to think about the damage a 7.9 earthquake and tsunami could do to our shores, environment, sea life, wildlife, etc.
3825 2018-01-23 16:55:33 Another way 2 look at this is, it's better than paying tax 4 subsidies on oil/gas/nuclear. This whole admin is illegitimate! Nothing is as it shldb! We watching the dismantling of a great nation!
3826 2018-01-23 16:55:08 Psalm 55:20-22
“My companion stretched out his hand against his friends, he violated his promise. His speech was smooth as butter, yet war was in his heart; his words were softer than oil, yet they were drawn swords. Cast your burden on the Lord and he will sustain you”
3827 2018-01-23 16:54:59 Canada does more than most E.U. nations in global & military aids. Trudeau needs to do more for Cdn.'s who toiled for decades for retirement as C. of L. spiral out of control. Capping gas/oil prices must be imposed on price gouging oil co.'s.
3828 2018-01-23 16:54:55 Lord these people messed up a simple oil change and fluid top off.
I’m about to come up in a new car or engine

3831 2018-01-23 16:54:28 By “means” do you mean Oil money? @creekyboy1
3832 2018-01-23 16:54:15 Due to Rupee depreciation caused by Oil spike and bad fiscal and economic management at the time.
3833 2018-01-23 16:54:10 Hope I don't get a bad reaction from this face mask. The last time I followed twitter beauty advice ke tswile dichubaba and my hairline started acting up no more coconut oil
3834 2018-01-23 16:53:58 I would rather burn the midnight oil then get a good nights sleep

3840 2018-01-23 16:53:37 Studies using MCTs typically have C8 and C10 medium-chain fatty acids, not C12 (lauric acid), which is the predominant medium-chain fatty acid found in coconut oil. Thus, we should careful to extrapolate the MCT research results to coconut oil.

3844 2018-01-23 16:53:01 I like oil better than butter...it’s easier and lasts longer
3845 2018-01-23 16:52:41 That was true 50-years ago when UK was approaching the peak of North Sea oil production. The Tories invested ZERO in future technologies and instead used the oil revenue to fund the de-industrialisation of Britain by paying 3m Northerners to languish on long term sick benefits!
3846 2018-01-23 16:52:38 The Republican Party is the enemy of US independence from foreign oil and its resulting influence. Remember that.

3852 2018-01-23 16:51:30 Need hair oil or something.
My hair is soft, but dry AF.
3853 2018-01-23 16:51:24 I wonder if you took a private plane or helicopter at our expense. I also wonder if you were scouting locations for new oil rig placement or coal mines.
3854 2018-01-23 16:51:24 Chilli, soon top in oil will be established for 2018 & fall after that will give respite
3855 2018-01-23 16:51:19 It would have been OK but devastating if Trump did all those cuts of 50-75% in so many Gov't agencies and started paying off the debt. 
But did he?!?!
Nope.
Propped up Oil, Coal and Nuclear along with Mil. Industrial Complex with even more tax dollars plus tax cuts.
3856 2018-01-23 16:51:18 Total SA commits to Lokichar-Lamu pipeline with a proposal to acquire shares in three Kenyan oil blocks.
3857 2018-01-23 16:51:12 Killing solar will not "bring back coal" or alleviate our dependence on foreign oil.
3858 2018-01-23 16:51:11 Because of the misinterpretation of statements like this: "...consumption of  medium-chain fatty acids — such as those found in coconut oil — led to  an increase in energy expenditure and fat oxidation compared with women  who ate long-chain or saturated fatty acids."
3859 2018-01-23 16:51:04 10 min oil change... *takes 35 minutes*
3860 2018-01-23 16:50:48 Feel like I always gotta get a damn oil change
3861 2018-01-23 16:50:39 I wish you were joking, but sadly you are right.

3863 2018-01-23 16:50:29 oh dope idea, yeah let's put a 30% import tariff on solar panels. hell yeah, i mean it isn't like we aren't already too dependent on coal and oil. fuck clean energy, right? nah let's build more pipelines and fuck the environment.
3864 2018-01-23 16:50:23 Coconut oil is literally the remedy for almost anything 
3865 2018-01-23 16:50:11 And I have it on good authority from some antifa friends of mine that the tires are only step 1. Next, they plan to take the motor oil that's been sitting in her car for 3 years & make it all dirty & ineffective
3866 2018-01-23 16:49:47 This is so important! We have got to respect Mother EarthPlus Oil & Coal mining are becoming obsolete. The price per barrel is continually dropping (Look at Argentina) There could be good, safe jobs n green, reusable energy, It’s being done now! Look towards the Future 
3867 2018-01-23 16:49:32 Totally. Pizza Hut uses canola oil, which is often hexane extracted. If you have a history of ulcers or other similar issue, hexane will screw you up.
3868 2018-01-23 16:49:32 Great oil if you need more can you get it in time?
3869 2018-01-23 16:49:26 Exactly. Plus keeping a market open for Russian oil/gas.
3870 2018-01-23 16:49:25 "They need to get this memo out yesterday."

people need to start screaming every second counts

squeaking wheel gets the oil

counterattack and diversions are coming
3871 2018-01-23 16:49:23 And that's just from getting the oil out of the ground. Add to this the environmental damage from burning it as fuel.
3872 2018-01-23 16:49:23 Our inability to diversify markets and obtain market price for our Oil and Gas is an ongoing embarrassment - thanks for telling it like it is Frank.

On this day in 1973 President Nixon says an agreement has been made to end the war in Vietnam
3881 2018-01-23 16:48:06 its Ok,, its not oil money.. we generate our own revenue and if we want we can buy 100 million worth of Cheese Burgers !!
3882 2018-01-23 16:48:00 I need to get an oil change on my lunch break
3883 2018-01-23 16:47:57 Trump only wants to help coal and big oil. This dick doesn't care about working americans
3884 2018-01-23 16:47:45 Hit the nail on the head. Screams 'oil money!' does it not?
3885 2018-01-23 16:47:43 Yeah for sure! One of them I go to she makes us lie down at the end of the session and uses a bit of olbas oil and massages your face it’s so relaxing
3886 2018-01-23 16:47:39 How can this happen in the backyard of former Oklahoma attorney general & current head of the EPA Scott Pruitt. It's not as if cutting worker safety regulations, oil & gas safety regulations, or mining safety regulations would ever pose a danger to human life.

3901 2018-01-23 16:45:47 Might as well say it. One more subsidy for Big Oil.
3902 2018-01-23 16:45:35 Truly awful. Needs to trust the process. He making sure his oil buddies catching that

3906 2018-01-23 16:44:45 Putin is big into oil and gas
3907 2018-01-23 16:44:43 That decision put enormous power to influence government, into the hands of capitalists. The point is that the public can't compete with the sheer wealth(read: power) that the wealthiest corporations have to spend on things like politicians who will protect oil.
3908 2018-01-23 16:44:42 Boil some water, remove from stove, put a couple drops of the oil in the water, and steam your face (towel over head). Life changing.
3909 2018-01-23 16:44:40 Reports assumes that 60% of the total taxes paid by the oil industry comes from income taxes and sales taxes.  However, "Detailed tax incidence studies that provide reliable estimates of tax payments by industry are simply not available in OK and most other states.

3924 2018-01-23 16:43:08 I went in to get an oil change, and they closed early due to not having enough employees to run it. That's not the first time this has happened.
3925 2018-01-23 16:43:07 To add some more confusion... energy sector red to solid red while oil up over 1 %.
3926 2018-01-23 16:43:07 He wants to kill the clean energy as a profitable industry and boost oil drilling. But he doesn’t understand how markets really work. Ppl don’t *want* oil as they used to. There’s a growing demand for renewable/clean energy sources and products. Supply will have to catch up.
3927 2018-01-23 16:43:02 I hate getting oil changed at the dealership they take forever lmao

3930 2018-01-23 16:42:52 Why would putin want trump? Bigger military, more oil drilling, (lowering prices that Russia depends on) exporting liquified natural gas to Europe. What about trump is in russia’s Interest.

3933 2018-01-23 16:42:27 You can mix white paint with oil and then pint them that way to get the effect of the second photos onwards xx
3934 2018-01-23 16:42:22 one of the most well known examples is britain’s involvement in overthrowing the iranian govt in (i think) 1953 after they nationalized the oil industry, and then supplanting it with the shah, who re privatized it for british oil companies
3935 2018-01-23 16:42:18 And what, exactly, has he "delivered" that is so important to evangelicals? Deporting people? Denying children health care? Give money back to the rich? Drilling for oil in previously untouched territory in Utah? What?
3936 2018-01-23 16:42:14 i love of emails now about oil, possibly frequented conferences on buying oil.

3940 2018-01-23 16:41:32 Cronyism at its worse.  Big oil & coal make big donations and get their way.  Libertarians hate crony capitalism because it gives the good kind of capitalism a bad name.
3941 2018-01-23 16:41:07 Been trying to get my father-in-law on Rick Simpson oil for over a year now. He has skin cancer and he’s been in and out of the hospital ever since he got it, and it only keeps getting worse. He is from the time of reefer madness and he refuses to believe it will work...

3952 2018-01-23 16:40:21 Yes.  But, remember OPEC+ is autocracies vs democracy.  No "price fixing" police to break-up OPEC+.  I have no doubt, if they could, every global oil producer would gladly join the cartel (including OECD), if they could!
3953 2018-01-23 16:40:19 They’re actually a specific type of pizza called Greek pizza. They use a lot of olive oil which is why it’s so greasy. But also yeah it tends to be mediocre.

3955 2018-01-23 16:40:12 How I get smooth legs:

First I shave, then I use a body scrub (I make it myself with sugar, coconut oil and coffee). After I wash off the scrub, I use a citrus lotion from The Body Shop

3961 2018-01-23 16:39:15 Hi @ProfTimNoakes I got this sunflower oil that is promoted as a banting product. Surely I can't cook with this though? Only for salads?
3962 2018-01-23 16:39:12 I have a hubsand and a daddy not changing oil or tires lol
3963 2018-01-23 16:39:12 Yeah, the BP oil gives it a very unique flavor.
3964 2018-01-23 16:38:48 Insane of him, but then what else is new with him...  From what I've seen the solar/wind productions of electric are now exceeding the coal/oil production, so from that it seems he wants to increase our energy cost
3965 2018-01-23 16:38:47 Ridiculous. If you give sculpting or oil painting tips does that hurt all painters and sculptors? Do graphite artists get hurt when I recommend decent pencils?

Pins cost a fortune to make too. Everyone who saw your tutorial isn't gonna use it to rush produce some for fun anyway!

3971 2018-01-23 16:38:07 "Right now" is not really accurate now that the crisis has moved on from prescription pills to heroin and fentanyl, which pharma doesn't make a dime off of. Anyway, this feels like a distraction, like suing oil companies...how about some safe injection sites?
3972 2018-01-23 16:38:06 And you let them go without pay. Sham on you trump President Trump Slaps Tariffs on Solar Panels in Major Blow to Renewable Energy. Ruining everybody’s jobs millions and billions of dollars go out the door I’ll because you want oil and coal. WTF
3973 2018-01-23 16:37:55 A big difference in Canadian politics when Prime Ministers are loved by the people.  It wasn't long ago former PM Harper wouldn't give a speech without barb wiring, a 10 foot fence, and 12 oil executives around him at all time.  Not many world leaders can walk with their people.

3977 2018-01-23 16:37:29 Solar needs to sue the administration for discriminatory tariffs against a singular energy over all others. China steel, oil, gas and other imports. Tariffs don't work and tariff wars will destroy our economy, but maybe that's what Trump promised China, Russia and others.
3978 2018-01-23 16:37:24 So my natural lashes are so damaged due to extension, and now I need patience every night in putting castor oil and aloe vera just so I can put them into life again. Why being adult is so damn hard?
3979 2018-01-23 16:37:19 An honest selling point. You already paid for the savings so you can pay again or get what you subsidized. And if you don't at least burn it in the winter for a basic auto, you are foolish. Don't believe the oil company lies.
3980 2018-01-23 16:37:16 It seems that to protect Afrin and Syrian Kurdish civilians from genocide by Turko-Al-Qaeda gangs, which is tacitly supported by the US, Kurds have no option other than handing Russia, the city of Raqqa? Or any of the oil fields that the US strive to defend in Dair-Al-Zur.

3991 2018-01-23 16:35:38 This is the reason why the impact of the low crude oil price is not felt much in 2017.
3992 2018-01-23 16:35:24 Deal happened because he is working on white agenda and white people love it. And you like it too.
3993 2018-01-23 16:35:21 The soya crops that are destroying the rainforests are grown to feed animals, not humans. Palm oil is a lot of foods, not just vegan ones. What's your point? That growing plants has its sustainability issues too? Yep. It sure does. But eating animals is completely unnecessary.

4005 2018-01-23 16:34:36 If you are just talking about the leaves they make a nice “pesto” or sauce. Think along the lines of a chimichurri. I also find that they make a nice flavoured oil or vinegar. But if cooked @ForagerLtd is correct - add them at the end just to warm through.

4096 2018-01-23 16:24:42 "We welcome oil but we are not intoxicated in oil and gas. Ug will grow into a modern country with or without oil," President Museveni
4097 2018-01-23 16:24:39 That said,if true, is only because of the worlds largest oil reserves being at stake. And greedy Americans want it for themselves and their bank accounts.
4098 2018-01-23 16:24:36 ew i was helping out @ stage crew for the school show and we painted props using oil based paint and it wont come off and its nasty

4100 2018-01-23 16:24:10 Doesn't matter if you're sitting, standing or lying down.  It's usually caused by calcium build up. I clear mine out from time to time by drinking lemon juice & olive oil. Bloody awful concoction but it seems to help dissolve them. Can't hurt to try.

4106 2018-01-23 16:23:27 This oil really helping my beard!
4107 2018-01-23 16:23:24 Your oil and gas sponsors love it that you are eliminating cheap solar panels from China. You just put thousands of people out of work and set back climate progress. Again, you know nothing. A manufacturing incentive would have worked, but no, you don’t like solar energy
4108 2018-01-23 16:23:24 Methinks you may be talking about oil reserves rather than the amount of oil in the ground. Technology is developing so fast in ways to retrieve that oil. I believe it said 1000 years. Does that sound right to you?
4109 2018-01-23 16:23:20 Need to oil Mother soon. Get all the hard-to-reach places.

End of debate .
4118 2018-01-23 16:22:38 US will become world second largest oil producer in 2018, ahead of Saudi Arabia and only step behind Russia. This is all about domestic shale oil and American dogged determination to extract it when the whole world said it was impossible. Three cheers for Yankee ingenuity
4119 2018-01-23 16:22:27 if that doesn't work you should try getting CBD Oil i know a lot of people who use it for their migraines
4120 2018-01-23 16:22:12 Agree fully with your take, but one nitpick: oil may be rebounding elsewhere, but in Canada, our prices are discounted by 50%. Not much upside here.

4126 2018-01-23 16:21:33 I think Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran probably fear the likely economic success of a modern Kurdistan given the territory currently occupied by Kurds includes some large oil fields.

4165 2018-01-23 16:17:27 We should be investing more into this industry than causing barriers to its growth. I understand many rural areas have no other jobs than just goal and oil. But we have to figure something out and stop protecting that industry from the market.

4168 2018-01-23 16:17:05 This is bullshit. This is trump, backing up oil companies, forcing us to use their power. I think we need to start making our own solar panels, and denying governments from acquiring them.

4176 2018-01-23 16:16:09 Lmao I appreciated the oil too. 
4177 2018-01-23 16:16:08 I am certain this was intended to help oil and coal, but probably forgot many panels are made in the USA. This was supported by a 2009 program ARRA during Obama Administration.  Alternative energy is inevitable, as big power price corruption mismanages their resources.

4217 2018-01-23 16:11:44 Trump passed the 30% tariff on imported solar cells not to help domestic manufacturing, but to help oil companies, slow renewables growth
4218 2018-01-23 16:11:35 Trump imposing the 30% tariff on solar is a step back in generating jobs. I understand you favor the coal and oil industry but you just set the stage for the solar panel industry to lose jobs.

4224 2018-01-23 16:11:17 Final note excludes the rise is related to historic global crude oil draws, economically eliminating the global crude/liquids over-supply that led to the price collapse.  That is a pretty major omission, considering the content of the other notes.  That is, IMO, the macro thesis.

4228 2018-01-23 16:11:02 So, why is Japan so hush-hush about the gigantic freaking oil spill disaster? Biggest tanker spill in a couple decades, and virtually no news or monitoring? #oilspills #savetheworld #BigBrother #propaganda #corporatecontrol
4229 2018-01-23 16:10:57 You forgot to mention that our administration is keeping us entrenched in old, dirty, unsustainable industries too, like coal, oil and other renewable energies while China invests heavily in what is coming, not what's past. We should all be ashamed of ourselves.
4230 2018-01-23 16:10:42 It is "Double Protectionism".  He protects US Coal and Oil financial interests on Macro.  He protects US on Micro.  Either way he screws the Environment any way you slice it.

His overlords are mainly in oil. Solar is mostly used for electric, no? So, no direct competition to his oil-y friends. I couldn't understand this move. Other than for sake of being evil

4252 2018-01-23 16:08:25 Walker: Coal did play a part here...on average played a 38% in the event.

The markets would have met the need with much higher resources. When we also rely on natural gas and oil, we also increase our exposure [to threats].

4289 2018-01-23 16:04:42 How many men know how to change a tire ? Or give a oil change ?
4290 2018-01-23 16:04:32 BP is probably trying to raise the price of the oil by scaring people. That pesky supply and demand thing.
4291 2018-01-23 16:04:30 Dude im just ohere watching youtube and i can feel the oil accumulating and coating my face gdi

4298 2018-01-23 16:03:27 Canola farmers thank you for using canola oil and thanks to them, there is a lot more where that came from.  Happy baking!
4299 2018-01-23 16:03:26 North Dakota, Wyoming etc. they have found A great deal of oil. Even if we didn’t have oil, natural gas would be the way to go and not solar.
4300 2018-01-23 16:03:21 Massage a few drops of coconut oil around the eyes to get rid off dark circles.
4301 2018-01-23 16:03:17 Using coconut oil for the lipid makes brownies taste delish. Highly reccomend

4304 2018-01-23 16:03:09 It’s all about deflection. The oil money is gone and their mistakes are obvious. They need to have the public looking elsewhere.
4305 2018-01-23 16:03:05 Oil change then Gym tonight !
4306 2018-01-23 16:02:56 We wanted a non-GMO roasting oil that has a very neutral flavor and would bring out the flavor of the nuts without overpowering their subtle flavors. We want to make products you can feel good about and are currently in the process of removing canola oil from our cashew desserts.
4307 2018-01-23 16:02:55 And while I agree the oil and gas companies need to stand on their own without government subsidies, I feel the same about Tesla's cars and Ohio's ethanol.  Yes, oil gets a lot, but don't pretend solar isn't heavily subsidized too.
4308 2018-01-23 16:02:48 My dad called me the other night to ask me how to reprogram his DVR. This is the man who taught me how to change the oil, fix a flat, and bait a hook. First time I've had the chance to start returning the favor.

4322 2018-01-23 16:01:47 @realDonaldTrump not only do you obstruct climate change precautions now 30% tariff on solar panels to help your oil friends - that really angers me - u r the worst!
4323 2018-01-23 16:01:43 They also ignore the fact that she was right and that the Vietnam “conflict” was an imperial effort to steal oil.
4324 2018-01-23 16:01:38 @acadlibrarian Okay. "Peak Oil" relative to the age of the earth.  Compare say SierraClub to AAPG (Am. Association of Petroleum Geologists) THAT is why to count carbon!  It's going pretty fast.

4340 2018-01-23 16:00:38 If I remember correctly, the young woman uses CBD or Cannaboid oil, which has a reduced amount of THC. Sessions has refused any supportive scientific studies and has requested the court ignore them also (thankfully, DoJ doesn’t control the courts... yet).

4342 2018-01-23 16:00:29 Government should prioritize the production of cooking oil raw materials.

It's embarrassing for Zimbabwe to import cooking oil raw materials since we are land liberated.
4343 2018-01-23 16:00:29 Maybe he thinks the oil you produce is the ultimate remedy....wait, no, that’s even worse 
4344 2018-01-23 16:00:27 Great! I hope you are over the top successful in your endeavors.
A person making $45,000 a year pays $238 of their tax dollars to social programs. They paid $3,000 of those tax dollars to corporate subsidies. Why do we panty oil companies 50 billion dollars a year?

It cant get any better than that!!!!!!
4369 2018-01-23 15:58:45 @RepHuffman Thank you for always protecting our coastlines from further oil drilling. HR3133, altering the MMPA of 1972, is a disastrous bill. Thank you for opposing it. That anyone would even think of altering MMPA is unconscionable!
4370 2018-01-23 15:58:42 Oil and gas, yeah. Coal isn’t market competitive cost-wise and Trump’s coal subsidy plan was shot down by his own appointees.
4371 2018-01-23 15:58:41 Several nations are stepping out of Dollar base oil currency this could mean a collapse for American economy.

4373 2018-01-23 15:58:38 Oil rigs are so scary 
4374 2018-01-23 15:58:14 Dems are complicit. They push gun control snake oil to distract people from the real causes that they don't want to touch.
4375 2018-01-23 15:58:07 Sticky out thing?  air filter with oil, everyone loves this!
4376 2018-01-23 15:57:59 i’m frying your veggie burgers with the chicken oil now thot
4377 2018-01-23 15:57:57 I agree this is bad and devastating, but 'solar employs more people than oil'? Hopefully one day, but that can't be true in 2018, right?
4378 2018-01-23 15:57:54 I used a Maui hair mask and olive oil
4379 2018-01-23 15:57:47 Oil hits 80 and it's goodbye to you screw 5 a gallon $uwt

Factory --> add oil (加油)
4381 2018-01-23 15:57:40 Yeah the Republicans are salivating at the DACA program they know they are going to get 800,000 new oil and gas workers when it passes.
4382 2018-01-23 15:57:37 In the past four days - 750 gallons of heating oil, two visits from a plumber plus a new sewage pump, AND two visits from our HVAC guy who is becoming our new BFF based on the frequency of our visits. Enjoy your avocado toast kids, home ownership isn't all that.
4383 2018-01-23 15:57:36 Yikes, I bet that wakes your face up in the morning!! I’m less biased but your oil is terrific 
4384 2018-01-23 15:57:34  they are like oil and water, they don't mix well

4392 2018-01-23 15:56:30 Do you see the irony in this.... if the Aggregate Act had of been in place 100 years ago Petrolia, and Centralia and all those small communities that discovered oil would never have existed. Did they ever pass the precious metal exclusion from the AA.

4395 2018-01-23 15:56:19 I was gonna be hella productive today but this oil change is taking so long I'm just gonna go back home and jump in the bed
4396 2018-01-23 15:56:16 Instead of giving tax breaks to oil and gas companies who make over 1 TRILLION dollars a year, we can tax them and care for our people and give them their god given right
4397 2018-01-23 15:56:14 Odd.  It's almost as if Trump is favoring the past over the future (literally, since oil comes from long dead organisms).

4403 2018-01-23 15:55:35 Drilling can't cause earthquakes in that region. It's always active, if not visibly so. The real danger is what you need to focus on and that's oil spills.

It takes a while to get a rig up and drilling and there's a limited supply of them
4404 2018-01-23 15:55:32 ..only trigger is when Fed stops buying everything under the sun..now their pushing oil up..there is no such thing as "price discovery" anymore
4405 2018-01-23 15:55:22 Gotta squeeze out every last penny for every bit of oil & gas on the planet & turn the place into a hell hole, right?
4406 2018-01-23 15:55:19 @USAbilAraby It is shameful and funny that the US secretary of state looks at the interests of his company before looking at the interests of his country and the responsibility of the position he owns ... he cares only about the interest of the oil company only.
4407 2018-01-23 15:54:56 You can never go in for just an oil change.
4408 2018-01-23 15:54:46 Lotion is water based, cream is oil based so in other words “ a luh dab’ll do ya”

4414 2018-01-23 15:54:32 Hi Marko  We use palm oil in some of our snacks due to it's mild flavour and long shelf-life but I can assure you that we only ever use palm oil that's RSPO certified sustainable 
4415 2018-01-23 15:54:31 Or rub your hands with some cooking oil. My grandmother taught me this. 
4416 2018-01-23 15:54:22 Despite TOPS, we make it very difficult for kids to afford college. Go Grants is never funded at more than half of need. And everyone knows how poorly resourced the elementary and second schools are. But billions for out-of-state oil companies!

4423 2018-01-23 15:53:33 Why, of all the China’s many products to add a tarrif to, Trump chooses solar panels?  Because he is in the pocket of big oil. 

#resist #impeachtrump #impeach45
4424 2018-01-23 15:53:32 And also a 30% tariff on imported oil.   Oh, wait....

Instead, tilt them a tiny bit so they contact at the front first
4428 2018-01-23 15:52:38 To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord , that he might be glorified.

4439 2018-01-23 15:51:45 Rex Tillerson stole Standard Oil from the Rockefellers.  Fracking broke the House of Saud.  Soros and the Rothschlds are next.  If Trump was a puppet, he like Putin and Xi have  cut their strings.
4440 2018-01-23 15:51:43 I love statements like this. In a couple years this statement will be laughable. Kinda like well never see $40 oil again (gartman) or that risk has been eliminated (Greenspan)  or the internet is a fad (krugman)
4441 2018-01-23 15:51:41 I think it has more to do with helping the oil and coal industry than with protecting solar manufacturing. A giant step backward.

4455 2018-01-23 15:49:51 And a president/party that sold its soul to Big Oil. 30% tariff on solar panels??? Reprehensible.

4467 2018-01-23 15:48:42 Maybe he doesn't want his financials release because he has deep interests in gas, oil, coal or all three...  not a whole lot else makes sense.
4468 2018-01-23 15:48:33 And govt policies have led to that collapse of the productive capacity of the oil industry, causing the hyperinflation. The currency and debt policies also reflect poor govt policies. Our own status as a reserve currency issued could be threatened by govt policy mistakes here.
4469 2018-01-23 15:48:33 You're being insulting now. It's not my job to educate you on how this admin is doing everything in its power to kill renewable energy in favor of oil and coal. There's plenty of data if you look. Bye.
4470 2018-01-23 15:48:32 Because no one is negatively impacted by nuclear, natural gas, coal or oil! Well there was that one time when something bad happened almost every time, or working conditions were gruel or a section of earth left inhabitable for a decade..

Rub her down with baby oil before sex so she looks made up & doesn't have to worry about dry patches between her butt cheeks or other places.
4477 2018-01-23 15:47:58 Yeah the Republicans are salivating at the DACA program they know they are going to get 800,000 new oil and gas workers when it passes.
4478 2018-01-23 15:47:55 So Walmart can’t change the oil on 4 car models and mine is one of the four. That’s so my luck lol

4517 2018-01-23 15:44:11 ISO-NE experienced "perhaps the greatest strain" on the system, NERC prez noted. Oil plants and hydro had to step in esp. after capacity loss of Pilgrim nuke.

4520 2018-01-23 15:44:03 Oh yeah, “By independence in 2016/17, Scotland’s fiscal deficit is forecast to have fallen to between 2.5 per cent and 3.2 per cent of GDP”. In truth it's actually 8.3%, but, yeah, OIL IS JUST A BONUS!! 
4521 2018-01-23 15:44:02 Nah dude, being able to lift heavy stuff and working on an oil rig are waaaaay cooler than creating a nurturing life.
4522 2018-01-23 15:43:57 By hand with a shovel. There were Mexican immigrants that lived next door they had work visas and worked digging for the gas/oil lines I felt bad when I learned what the one man was making while going through his naturalization I couldn’t possibly tell his wife why it was bad bc
4523 2018-01-23 15:43:57 If you’re tryna go an all natural route, castor oil is really the best for chapped lips. This is coming from someone who has tried like 10+ different oils & at least 30 diff lip balms. You are welcome for my insight.
4524 2018-01-23 15:43:48 I’m going to start bringing my own damn toilet paper to class... Marshall’s toilet paper is sandpaper soaked in poison ivy oil...
4525 2018-01-23 15:43:40 If it's a chore, it's undercooked, or dried out. Roast anything coated in oil and salt at high heat until soft, and it will be delicious.
4526 2018-01-23 15:43:29 Bit late to the party here! Thanks @thecookandhim... glad you’re enjoying the oil  Our EVAO can be used from Drizzle to Sizzle and evening Dipping. Think EVOO but with higher smoke point and less harsh flavour.

4532 2018-01-23 15:42:44 Fun Fact: Rinse everyday for 15min with coconut  oil. It extracts bacteria & reduces the chance of cavities. Also whitens your teeth. This is called Oil Pulling.
4533 2018-01-23 15:42:43 I loved your recipe for the pumpkin seed oil serum!
4534 2018-01-23 15:42:39 WATER IN PIPELINES..NOT OIL. SOUTH AFRICA NEEDS WATER. WHERE R CANADIAN TANKERS W PIPELINED WATER FROM THE NORTH? CANADIAN OWNED WATER, NOT NESTLES WATER! @JustinTrudeau @CanadianPM @cdn_millennials @ElizabethMay @CanadianGreens @APTNNews
4535 2018-01-23 15:42:29 Good bye coffee. You and I got along like water and oil.
4536 2018-01-23 15:42:26 It’s either a natural gas well or an oil well. @joshfirstnowell can clarify
4537 2018-01-23 15:42:11 speaking of big oil - has anyone noticed the price of filling up the tank has been steadily going up now that the GOP is in charge - gas prices considerably higher
4538 2018-01-23 15:42:05 Rose water (rose oil) is very natural and helps balance the ph in your skin. It has anti inflammatories, antioxidants, and antibacterial properties. It’s also very moisturizing in a natural way so it rids acne! You can get a spray bottle of it on amazon :)

4542 2018-01-23 15:41:39 This na morning by the Buhari finish with you all the oil wey dey your body go dry
4543 2018-01-23 15:41:30 Not advocating for socialism as a business owner but it worked a lot better when oil prices were at peak. More than political economy choices, hitching one’s economy to commodity prices is always a bad idea.

4545 2018-01-23 15:41:06 Ok, so, y'all. I couldn't get the oil delivery last week because of shit weather (fuck you snow), but they are coming tomorrow. My credit is good, but not good enough for a payment plan.
4546 2018-01-23 15:40:52 Damn Dee I ain’t think of coconut oil
4547 2018-01-23 15:40:51 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
4548 2018-01-23 15:40:30 Trump’s tariffs should mean many more opportunities for U.S. investment into the manufacturing of solar panels and other green energy needs.
Gripped in the clutches of the swamp (Big oil). Oil lobbyists pulling the strings of the Orange haired puppet. Cut the strings and go green
4549 2018-01-23 15:40:27 Saya ada perfect watery oil tu. awak nak ke ? Baru pkai 2 kali.. 
4550 2018-01-23 15:40:24 マテウス、あのおねーさんよくね？
4551 2018-01-23 15:40:22 Manufacturing jobs are basically gone and they aren’t coming back. The jobs in solar here are in sales, installation, and maintenance. This tarriff will hurt all of them. It’s a cynical giveaway to the oil companies anyway, not a serious try at creating more jobs
4552 2018-01-23 15:40:12 "For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:" ~Proverbs 5:3 #Bible

4554 2018-01-23 15:40:11 I know the feeling. You need a moisturizer like coconut oil or some shit. Lotion ain’t gon do it.
4555 2018-01-23 15:40:09 エクストラバージンオイルってなんか卑猥だよね。
4556 2018-01-23 15:40:03 To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it
4557 2018-01-23 15:39:30 Excellent point.  He is going to be reviled as the trash he is, and I'd rather be boiled in oil than to get anywhere near him.  You and your fellow historians are going to have a field day memorializing this creature in chief.
4558 2018-01-23 15:39:18 @HondaCustSvc frustrated with the maintenance minder on my 2017 elite Pilot. Oil change Interval is supposed to be 7500 miles and rear differential at 15000 buy MM is telling me to change immediately at 12,000 miles.
4559 2018-01-23 15:39:11 What if solar panel tariffs are really a long term game to bring back coal? 

Kill alternative energy options and make your coal and oil cronies happy.
4560 2018-01-23 15:39:05 So the weirdest compliment I’ve ever heard was today, sitting waiting for an oil change.  “ you have strong looking calves. “ what. 
4561 2018-01-23 15:38:50 Yea oil based enamel all have solvents I wont bore you with the chemical names but its an overpowering smell. A water based is not as thick but a lot easier to work with.
I see you are getting our super diy stores Bunnings in the UK, they are huge.and dangerous $$$$$ lol
4562 2018-01-23 15:38:49 Had my removing of oil clog seed at my face !
4563 2018-01-23 15:38:49 It can be fixed by what Obama and his ilk say. It’s not 100% scientific proof. Pro-coal? Oil? Do they supply jobs to Americans? Then yes I’m pro jobs. I’m pro immigration. Not pro illegal immigration. My family came here before the US Revolution. They caught for. And I will too.
4564 2018-01-23 15:38:45 Little coconut oil and magnesium always works.
4565 2018-01-23 15:38:34 The fossil fuel tax breaks, were given to them because they were forced to take oil leases in the gulf, when no one in the world had a clue in how to drill in a mile of water, let alone 4 or 5 miles to get oil. They invested billions, on the promise of reduced taxes.
4566 2018-01-23 15:38:32 Egg yolks contain some types of fatty acid/cholesterol/oil type molecules which are conditioning to hair, I think.
4567 2018-01-23 15:38:29 Cold air in the deepest spot in the Gulf of Mexico . The legs of an oil platform . Transfer into eye of the hurricane.

4573 2018-01-23 15:37:41 I'd rather shove chopped habaneros in my ears and scratch my junk with habanero oil on my hands than listen to them in the same segment.
4574 2018-01-23 15:37:10 That comment Iooks like the typical fear from Venezuela’s neighbor oil markets. They are not convinced that Venezuela still has the best conditions to produce oil even with the current business model and way of management used by actual government

4595 2018-01-23 15:33:51 I need to get an oil change so bad omg
4596 2018-01-23 15:33:41 We need to have #moderation and #balance in our lives. Avocados, dark chocolate, coconut oil, etc may be good for you, but they are still sources of fat. Eat them accordingly... not too much.

4601 2018-01-23 15:33:30 oh, my comrade!!
4602 2018-01-23 15:32:59 Fundamentals are full bullish.  Outlooks are mixed.  COT is surely singular focused, but if they are reacting to real market change, not just speculation of market change, it is not a right thesis to assume positioning is all speculation, ready to turn.  Oil at 64+ is not high.
4603 2018-01-23 15:32:56 Sir i will give the crude oil break up rate as per 17th jan 2018, according to that the tamilnadu govt have a income of Rs.11,43,99,660 per day, where is this money going. this income only from 4702 petrol bunks in tamilnadu, please talk with admk person
4604 2018-01-23 15:32:47 As if it had nothing to do with making America safe for the oil and gas industries.  And clean coal.

4618 2018-01-23 15:31:42 One is for sure. “Employment in natural resources” for Saskatchewan includes uranium and potash that hasn’t recovered yet like oil has and that makes the comparison skewed

4634 2018-01-23 15:30:25 So, apparently, our “hero in chief” plans to impose tariffs on foreign made solar panels, thus driving up the cost, and ensuring our dependence on Koch brothers oil
4635 2018-01-23 15:30:17 みんな、夜更かしはだめだよ。そろそろ寝ましょう。
4636 2018-01-23 15:30:15 There is plenty on evidence but tory fools never check it out coz they're so indoctrinated by the rich to think private good public bad. You enjoying the high rail fares high energy bills. We sold BP Norway kept theirs oil in state hands we lost 400 billion just 1 mad example
4637 2018-01-23 15:30:11 Cold-pressed extra-virgin olive oil is a healthy alternative for butter on potatoes, grains, vegetables, and bread.
4638 2018-01-23 15:30:03 Chinese academic Lin Boqiang says Trumps tariffs on Chinese washing machines and solar panels will backfire. US is not that big a mkt but China is a big mkt for US gas and oil. Hint hint.... #wef18

4640 2018-01-23 15:29:58 'His loyalty was to the US' - Does that include the 1000s of American soldiers that died in his invasion and destruction of Iraq for oil? How about the millions of American citizens further impoverished under him? Perhaps his loyalty was more to enriching elites then to the US?
4641 2018-01-23 15:29:53 俺は逆にその気持ちだな！？！？
うぇーい
4642 2018-01-23 15:29:33 It seems this would have a short-term effect of protecting traditional energy, e.g. oil, gas, coal. Perhaps longer term it could help US become more of a player in solar.
4643 2018-01-23 15:29:33 Adulting is being excited that more oil was delivered so you can set your heat to 70 and snuggle up w your kid
4644 2018-01-23 15:29:26 Two words. Oil industry
4645 2018-01-23 15:29:10 Protecting mfrs is a side benefit. This tariff mostly protects utilities and big oil.
4646 2018-01-23 15:29:08 I'm aware of who this person is. He is Trump sycophant, he murders unsuspecting animals, he is threatening our environment via lumbering and oil drilling.
4647 2018-01-23 15:28:58 Apple, coal mining, oil (pipeline), small business is picking up.  Low unemployment, lowest black unemployment in 45 years. Businesses are hiring because of lower taxes on business.  Holiday spending was up.  People are making money.
4648 2018-01-23 15:28:53 learn Trump has imposed a 30% tariff on solar panels virtually killing the solar industry. Solar employs more people than coal and oil combined. today's decision will cause the loss of roughly 23,000 American jobs this year. CHIEF! SAY IT AINT SO!!

4652 2018-01-23 15:28:39 Well yeah. In a perfect world. As a Celtic fan trained in watching them at the European level, you learn that wins don't all need to be oil paintings, but you take them and never let go.
4653 2018-01-23 15:28:29 I (mildly) worry industry has ignored prod decline in readying replacement supply, favouring s/t fin #'s.  When one considers the importance of oil to the "norms" of modern life, any risk of under supply, to daily life, is exponential compared to almost any other commodity.
4654 2018-01-23 15:28:20 Kangin get confused about what to teach Kyu,
because once Kyu incorrectly entered oil when
cooking a simple ham.
4655 2018-01-23 15:28:19 Welp I just woke up with a dab of oil stuck in my beard
4656 2018-01-23 15:28:09 May I ask why? Definitely not an expert in the oil department. :)
4657 2018-01-23 15:28:03 oil and gas kena amik lesen oil and gas dulu cap
4658 2018-01-23 15:28:03 WTI oil at $63.87/barrel, +$0.30.

4660 2018-01-23 15:27:49 UK's entry: botox and plastic surgery. Ireland's entry: fake tan, fake tattoos and baby oil. #eurovision
4661 2018-01-23 15:27:47 Lmaooo not when you cook them in olive oil and throw some salt, pepper and lemon juice! And deep fried? Omg you’re tripping
4662 2018-01-23 15:27:46 Thought u said we can literally buy anything with our Oil money? Lmao
4663 2018-01-23 15:27:40 Some oil/gas companies dabbled in fuel such as Gulf Oil and Kerr-McGee, but ultimately they threw their lot in with dead dinosaurs. Too bad.
4664 2018-01-23 15:27:25 It all depends upon what your definition of a good man. Anyone who is a Trump sycophant, who murders unsuspecting animals, who is exploiting America's environment for money via hunting, oil drilling, lumbering, is questionable about being a good man.
4665 2018-01-23 15:27:19 The only reason he would do this is to jerk off the oil industry.

4671 2018-01-23 15:26:47 When price of oil rises oil related currencies will suffer due to more incentive for FRACKERS to produce more oil which can kill the market.
4672 2018-01-23 15:26:43 No just baby oil.

4696 2018-01-23 15:23:48 The "hyperemesis" is actually Azadirachtin poisoning caused by consuming cannabis that a grower has sprayed an excessive amount of pesticide on. Neem oil contains Azadirachtin and is a commonly used pesticide.

4698 2018-01-23 15:23:41 Today twitter taught me that coconut oil is actually a sealant and not a moisturiser. I can't wait to stop using it on my body cause I'm always dry AF. Apparently avocado oil is the better oil option.

But honestly this boujee life is just too much. I need to revisit vaseline.

4704 2018-01-23 15:23:14 Delph hardly plays & they only just bought walker. Who’s going to miss out if Laporte comes. My issue is the money they spend from their oil rich owners. All of a sudden their on a high horse saying man utd paid too much for Sanchez. Yet they’ve probably spent 200mil on defence.
4705 2018-01-23 15:23:11 What kinda of coconut oil pls?
4706 2018-01-23 15:23:03 as for $oil, staying neutral now until it goes below 64 = bearish
4707 2018-01-23 15:23:02 Dermatologist just told me to stop using coconut oil...as natural I got a bit mad, like this is a staple in the community and I don't know if I can just give it up
4708 2018-01-23 15:23:00 True but at least when the oil is gone we are left standing wenger playing the long game 
4709 2018-01-23 15:22:55 invest in oil then.
4710 2018-01-23 15:22:51 Bending over to reach the middle of the light cabinet is killing my back. Glad I have my oil mix for pain!
4711 2018-01-23 15:22:49 Except you're ignoring how advantages can go the other way as well. Like when oil companies spend billions on equipment, boost production, then the price of oil falls and they sell it for a loss. That's why there's such a thing as a buyer's market.
4712 2018-01-23 15:22:49 I do not agree that Khadaffi was ousted for signing oil contracts in Euros, there is no evidence to back that claim. I do agree with Bitcoin replacing fiat but do not follow your energy reasoning.

4731 2018-01-23 15:21:32 It's a better business. But we don't have a bottomless pit of oil money to spend.

4743 2018-01-23 15:20:49 This is being viewed by some as a love letter to the oil industry. Solar industry folks say this has the potential to be devastating to their industry, because there simply aren't enough domestic suppliers to meet the rising demand. One solar CEO said could cost 23k jobs.
4744 2018-01-23 15:20:45 You can buy anything with that OIL money.. Pep or without pep you ll be fine as long as OIL money is flowing..

4766 2018-01-23 15:18:24 Spot on. Trump acts like warehouses, manufacturing & labor just appear miraculously while he cuts us off from intl resources. This is about oil of course. In the meantime, the solar industry--a source of employment way beyond that of the coal industry--will suffer greatly.

Canada, debtor of the United States, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Algeria and all the other countries it imports oil from so it can virtue signal... now carbon tax Canucks... who have less quality jobs to pay taxes.

4830 2018-01-23 15:12:30 It's no secret the oil industry owns us, and congress. Polluting the planet is secondary to profit. What happen to the fuel sell Bush said was two years away?? Solar panels work, so they must be stopped.
4831 2018-01-23 15:12:24 Ooh and I mix olive oil and sugar to make a scrub to remove excess skin and smooth out my lips so I don't pick at them.
4832 2018-01-23 15:12:24 This is very helpful! We are considering the addition, but want to make sure it'll make a difference in oil consumption. We're oil hot water heated and it's *fine* but... Uneven and not that efficient
4833 2018-01-23 15:12:20 The idea is that the economies and India and China continued to grow even when oil prices were above $140, despite the fact the E&P investment is tiny relative to that of the US. 
Also, shale oil spending in US started in 2009

4851 2018-01-23 15:10:45 Good point. At the same time, perhaps the people who model these future scenarios are zoomed out so far that they miss the steady march of inventories lower each week. They look at what may happen with tight oil & sanctioned projects while the real world passes them by.

4856 2018-01-23 15:10:26 I’ll answer for him. The Oil and Gas industry is risky and can be dangerous. Just like any other industry. We should be more concerned about the missing people and those injured than worrying about politics.

4864 2018-01-23 15:09:45 Well, our oil heat has not turned on since we got it, so consumption has been drastically reduced. They claimed electricity could be as low as $1 a day to heat the house, but we haven't received a bill yet so I can't confirm that.

4893 2018-01-23 15:06:33 Thanks! I have the same thoughts, the way oil ran up just doesn't make much sense and having everyone so bullish, especially the CFTC numbers, really makes me question this run up. I like your put purchase. I missed the short on the failed breakout at 40 :(

4916 2018-01-23 15:04:25 When somebody does something and you can’t tell why look for the money. People will make more money if solar is more expensive. That could be the motivation. Many of trumps “friends” are big oil, and they donate and have memberships in his club etc.
4917 2018-01-23 15:04:23 Which brings up an interesting question: lots of those out of the way border areas are used by oil companies to host refining facilities. What happens when they gotta go dig near them?

4945 2018-01-23 15:02:17 I'm so glad you're an Independent, @JoeNBC . But you've misjudged the Centrist Democrats. All sorts of room under the tent for unrepentant conservatives, war hawks, oil lobby puppets and pharmaceutical marionettes.

4950 2018-01-23 15:02:01 I do bidnis with a very savvy oilman in Texas who has been into wind for a few years. Doesn’t see oil going away, but sees $ in subsidized alternatives. Reducing GHG while gaming the system. Smart man.

4953 2018-01-23 15:01:48 Not saying they're great buys here but the power shown by the big-cap oil service plays like $HAL and $SLB likely confirms that group has turned the corner longer-term me thinks

4955 2018-01-23 15:01:45 Hey realDonaldTrump how about a real level playing field? 30% tariff on imported oil? #Solar #Jobs #Energy
4956 2018-01-23 15:01:43 推しにあいたいのぉ
4957 2018-01-23 15:01:41 As a solar company, we are devastated to learn Trump has imposed a 30% tariff on solar panels virtually killing the solar industry. Solar employs more people than coal and oil combined. today's decision will cause the loss of roughly 23,000 American jobs this year.

4963 2018-01-23 15:01:09 Disgusting! But no surprise, it’s Big Oil who elected the sociopath
4964 2018-01-23 15:01:06 I think that each product needs to be checked for its ethical credentials. Palm oil can be produced in a sustainable manner. Interesting about the stir fries... Ive got a lot left. #Bulkbuy #UKFoodHour

4979 2018-01-23 14:59:59 Environmental nuts make solar panel production in the US expensive. China doesn't care about the environment..so there's no way we can compete.. we have enough oil & gas that we don't have to worry about solar energy.. so let the market decide.. there's no rush..
4980 2018-01-23 14:59:56 I guess the republicians are getting out the praying oil again
4981 2018-01-23 14:59:53 I think it's safe to assume that Big Oil is pumping CO2 into the earth's crust

4983 2018-01-23 14:59:46 The BJP-led NDA government had raised excise duty nine times between November 2014 and January 2016 to shore up finances as global oil prices fell, but cut the tax only once in October last year by Rs 2 per litre.

4986 2018-01-23 14:59:31 It looks ignorant. In an absolute sense it probably is since Trump often doesn’t know what he is doing. But whoever told him to put tariffs on Solar is probably bought and paid for by the oil companies

4994 2018-01-23 14:58:16 Might be a silly question but was your coconut oil fresh?  The only time I've found it to have an overly strong flavour in baking was from a jar I'd had opened for a while. As for avocado oil, interested to see how it works too - aubergine brownies sounds intriguing! #UKFoodHour

5003 2018-01-23 14:57:32 You don't dig electricity out of the ground either. You burn coal or oil to make it. Zero emissions is a fallacy.

5006 2018-01-23 14:57:11 tasted good too! its a box cake, but i replaced the oil with butter and the water with almond milk (1:1 ratio), and added an extra egg

its guuuuuuuuuud
5007 2018-01-23 14:57:08 Great article today. I bought some long term puts in oil (April 20 expiration)...But part of me wonders if this run will be like the run down from the top a few years ago. I kept buying calls and it kept going down, down, down. Got crushed a few times.
5008 2018-01-23 14:56:59 what its name says: oil coin.. since all petrol contracts are made with it letting the united states understand energy markets like no else does. if you don’t agree with that like saddam o khadafi, you’ll meet the consequences in no time.

5017 2018-01-23 14:55:59 If you have dry skin yo should follow up with a butter or moisturizer the coconut oil is more healing and scar reducing than moisturizing it's more of a lite moisturizer
5018 2018-01-23 14:55:58 While I agree re: tarriffs, "Solar employs more people than oil and coal combined"? That needs to be fact checked, John.

5046 2018-01-23 14:53:09 They have no intensions of stopping the (kill every form of clean energy). There are two money makers that have provided tremendous wealth to a few and Oil is one of them.

5048 2018-01-23 14:52:43 @DHSgov Kirstjen Nielsen, I just saw a video where you said Norwegians are hardworking.. I am afraid thats not entirely true, they were fortunate enough to have the oil. I believe Americans are much more hardworking but they have a lame government...

5050 2018-01-23 14:52:22 I'm not discounting how this is going to impact the solar companies, because it's going to be way more expensive to source the panels from First Solar in Tempe than from China. But the story isn't that Trump is trying to kill renewable energy to benefit his oil cronies.

Where oil and coal

And oil bills make you wanna cry

5223 2018-01-23 14:35:20 Lots of oil and petrochemicals, stuff we’re not allowed to do up here right #ClimateBarbie ... we sell our oil to the US at a discount because we can’t build pipelines and get it to tide water, then they sell the value added manufactured product back to us, kinda dumb eh #elitist

Very leveraged oil play. If prices stay high and fracking restarts in any major way, its gonna move.

The massive short interest will make it happen quickly too.

5268 2018-01-23 14:30:54 It will likely go as well as Mexico's effort to open their oil and gas sector to private investors. They didn't get a single bid that met the preset minimum. (Too much risk, not enough reward.)

5275 2018-01-23 14:30:17 En el gobierno de @MashiRafael se vendieron 16,5 millones de barriles de fuel oil a Petrochina. El combustible iba a ser producido por la Refineria del Pacífico pero esta no existía, no existe, no está construída. Vendimos hasta lo que no había.
5276 2018-01-23 14:30:16 Outside of Alberta, the #oilsands supports local jobs at more than 3,400 businesses from across Canada. Protesting pipelines means discounted oil exports which equals a discounted quality of life and less social services for all Canadians

5278 2018-01-23 14:30:05 Some guy told me all I like is Mexicans that work the oil rigs lol I fucking hate you!! 
5279 2018-01-23 14:30:03 I and many others don’t think that’s ridiculous. Buying local is a growing movement as is not owning/driving. Electric cars are now in the movement. This is all increasing the number of people putting the brakes on Big Oil. Not an easy task when they own the government (voters)

5293 2018-01-23 14:29:11 that’s a common misconception of the materialists. the domain of the petrodollar is information: making sure no oil deal happens on a different currency.

5295 2018-01-23 14:28:55 Purchased or rented politicians talk about renewables, but really are striving to make room for a continuation of the current wealth and power dynamics. Just imagine what the price of oil might be with abundant, accepted fission

5308 2018-01-23 14:28:07 Natural gas futures up over 5%.  Crude oil up about 1% There is a move higher in energy
The Natural gas futures are up about 5.5% on the day and Crude oil futures are up 1%. Yesterday, the IMF raised growth prospects. Is that giving the energy complex some upside momentum?  …
5309 2018-01-23 14:28:07 From another angle. if an oil and gas  company does not count with a decent security and loss control department with the resources needed to prevent losses and control operational damages like in case of #PDVSA, then i don't think theres much to do trying to recover production
5310 2018-01-23 14:27:47 Me to me: Don't use cooking oil.

5316 2018-01-23 14:26:57 the known side effects or "unintended" consequences of the solar tariffs are perhaps intended to return energy dominance to oil % gas and reverse Obamas pro solar agenda
5317 2018-01-23 14:26:54 Agree. Check back around the start of January, I did a post showing how $60 oil should produce a $48 $XOP. That was over the last 2.5 years of data. Going back to '07 really makes things look cheap now, which might be what funds also start thinking about the sector

5324 2018-01-23 14:25:53 Wait, what? The US has just enacted a 30% tariff on solar panels? ... C'mon humans, please fight the oil vampires. How much more obvious does it need to be?!
5325 2018-01-23 14:25:42 Great, except the reason they are made abroad is those foreign companies own the patents and US companies don't. Right now they cannot be produced by US firms. This is all about protecting oil and coal for his buddies

5328 2018-01-23 14:25:32 New tariffs on Solar Industry.  Pandering to Koch Brothers, TB Pickens, coal, and big oil.  Trump is bought and owned.  You should be ashamed for defending this hack.  Sad!  #Romney2020.

5331 2018-01-23 14:25:24 REALLY upsetting about the 6,000 gallon oil spill in the Naugatuck River.

5332 2018-01-23 14:25:18 Just wondering if Trump will raise the tariffs on the garbage he has manufactured in china instead of america? Or is it just the solar industry that WILL the BIG OIL industries downfall ? BIG OIL IS going down. Mark it down

5336 2018-01-23 14:25:07 Saudi’s aren’t happy since we are finally producing more oil then they are.  Isis isn’t happy because we are killing them on the battlefield. Mexico isn’t happy because we are cutting off their cash by addressing the border.
5337 2018-01-23 14:25:06 Alberta's oil sands that gets so much Flack from Hollywood know-nothings is some of the cleanest environmentalism you could hope for.  The land after they're done with it flourishes with life, while the oily areas languish and animals die.  It's a big clean up effort.

5339 2018-01-23 14:25:02 Fresh spinach sautéed in a little olive oil, sea salt, pepper, minced garlic, a splash of lemon, and a dash of red pepper flakes will make you change your mind. Also, it shouldn’t be cooked for more than about 3 min. Just enough to wilt it down
5340 2018-01-23 14:25:00 Probably more just the oil being in the wrong place..like not in the actual engine

5515 2018-01-23 14:08:07 Philadelphia Energy Solutions said it went bankrupt because of  "skyrocketing costs" to comply with EPA's Renewable Fuel Standard.  The rule, aimed at lowering pollution, requires refiners to either blend  oil with renewable fuels or buy credits.

5582 2018-01-23 14:00:58 Sir,,this was initially about passport colour. But, as far as the oil prices are concerned, Oil is not under the GST. It follows old taxes like Excise duty, VAT,etc. This is not Modi's fault It is because the states are not accepting. If oil comes under GST then it will be cheap.

5780 2018-01-23 13:38:57 Money is flowing into US markets, from where? Bitcoin? Japan? UK? Profits in the Oil trade?
5781 2018-01-23 13:38:53 @Morning_Joe The tariffs look like an attempt to undermine the push for renewable energy, a boost to oil and coal, and a shot at Germany's solar panel industry.
5782 2018-01-23 13:38:52 I don’t even use beard oil like that but where do you grab this one from?
5783 2018-01-23 13:38:52 This is clearly a gift to Exxon and his friends who invest in the losing oil and gas industry. Vote Nov 2018 and put controls on this ....hole.
5784 2018-01-23 13:38:48 Is this purely to pay back oil industry support?
5785 2018-01-23 13:38:08 Because he gets money from big oil!!!
5786 2018-01-23 13:38:00 Spain holds the record forbeing the world’s largest
producer of olive oil andnowhere makes more of
the stuff than Andalucía. #Spain #olive #oil #Andalucía #foodie
5787 2018-01-23 13:37:52 I need coconut oil plix
5788 2018-01-23 13:37:47 @KateVsTheWorld Just a heads up. The article headline is just pure spin, fake news, there's nothing to substantiate it in the article. If you google "Radiacid", you find: sunflower oil fatty acid, lauric fatty acid, rubber stearic acid
5789 2018-01-23 13:37:39 I lost my cloth to clean my glasses and it's basically like someone smeared coconut oil all over my lenses. I'm really stevie wonder to it all smh
5790 2018-01-23 13:37:38 Have you got any oil cloves that normally reduces the pain.
5791 2018-01-23 13:37:13 kapag yung oil nasa ibabaw ng tubig. ang tubig ba ay basa? o ang oil ang basa? knowing na hindi ito nahahalo sa tubig???
5792 2018-01-23 13:37:04 Respected Sir, I need 1 barrel (210 Listers) Servo 68 Oil. Pls. Suggest me some dealers near my location at Howrah. Thank you.
5793 2018-01-23 13:37:03 What thebTrump Admin has done is a kick in the Ass of Americans!! Huge Tax Cuts for Big Oil & What do they do? Raise the Gasoline prices for NO APPARENT REASON OTHER THAN BECAUSE THEY CAN!!!
5794 2018-01-23 13:37:01 I just started getting ads about engine oil 
5795 2018-01-23 13:36:57 What’s next? Cars? Oil? Tech? Has he picked solar because it’s a perceived totem of the “globalist elites”?
5796 2018-01-23 13:36:48 At 8:45 on 90.1 @wabenews:  A talk with GA Republican Congressman @RepBuddyCarter about the chances the GA coast will see offshore oil and gas drilling.
5797 2018-01-23 13:36:47 It did taste nice! However, I'm not sure I would order it again because the tallow didn't do anything that butter or olive oil couldn't do for flavor.

It was in a bar in North Hollywood.
5798 2018-01-23 13:36:44 The Oil money has helped a ton of teams, City and PSG included. Don't really see how some fans can complain though. United, Madrid, Barca, etc... Always find a way to buy top players and pay insane wages. It's a money sport unfortunately.
5799 2018-01-23 13:36:36 Mayon is spewing lava, oil prices are up again, typhoon victims need assistance, Marawi rehab has yet to start, etc., yet Congress hastily convenes the Con-Ass. #Priorities
5800 2018-01-23 13:36:24 tf water is not wet but can oil get wet
5801 2018-01-23 13:36:23 As is nanny-statism. Doctor doesn't always know best. Even when he/she does, don't mum and dad have a right to try?
5802 2018-01-23 13:35:55 dami kong medicated patch sa katawan ++ efficacent oil HAHAHA
5803 2018-01-23 13:35:47 It might affect the oil pipelines and Russia along with Tillerson might not be able to make billions more off America #americastripped
5804 2018-01-23 13:35:43 Solar power industry employs more Americans than coal and oil combined, yet tRump just put a 30% tariff on solar panels. Bought and paid for by big oil Koch Bros. Not even trying to hide blatant corruption.
5805 2018-01-23 13:35:42 Lol oil  yidurha  kuhunda  munyu  hika  5 se anga  yikotahiyini
5806 2018-01-23 13:35:35 When you're as stupid as these ppl that u can literally sell them snake oil, there's nothing left to say

5808 2018-01-23 13:35:24 so does that mean if the oil is on top of the water. water is wet??
5809 2018-01-23 13:35:22 Well Oil'ed be blown,24 hour chippy!  Too much violence!  Always scraps there, the fish get battered, The owner fritters the profit away.  Open one and they'll all be jumping on the gravy train! I don't think it will curry favor with the council they want the business wrapped up!
5810 2018-01-23 13:35:00 But plastic is a by product of the oil refining process. We can’t just use something else.
5811 2018-01-23 13:34:59 After all that fight against Big Oil...
5812 2018-01-23 13:34:35 The article headline is just pure spin, fake news, there's nothing to substantiate it in the article. If you google "Radiacid", you find: sunflower oil fatty acid, lauric fatty acid, rubber stearic acid
5813 2018-01-23 13:34:35 1) Leave your batter to sit for at least 20 mins at room temp
2) When you take the tray with the hot oil out of the oven put it over a couple of gas burners on the hob to heat further, if you can. When you add the batter = sizzle = great rise.

5818 2018-01-23 13:33:58 Part of the truth is how the wars we’ve had is to serve a few purposes, $, oil, and human sacrifice

5826 2018-01-23 13:32:49 The petrol prices in US , controlled by bigger and meaner Oil companies have remain more or less unchanged from 2017 to 2018 inspite of hurricanes. Why this loot in India?
5827 2018-01-23 13:32:48 The only real way to force NK to give up their nukes is for the UN to impose a sea blockade. This way Russia, Chine will not be able to sell oil and other stuff while NK won't be able to sell whatever it is they sell to the world.

can oil get wet
5838 2018-01-23 13:31:14 Ctude oil traded last week is over 18%, i pays 1.40e in poland as well in italy n germany last 4 weeks. Stop fooling indians
5839 2018-01-23 13:31:06 So 30% tariffs imposed on imports of solar panels. 10s of 1000’s expected to lose their jobs in an industry with a 68% annual growth; in favor of industries of oil and coal. 45 is destroying us. #WakeUpAmerica
5840 2018-01-23 13:30:55 So it's a Specialist Industrial Cleaning company, not an 'oil company'. Lazy headline writing, lazy journalism. 'Oil Company' grabs more attention I guess, even if untrue.
5841 2018-01-23 13:30:51 「狂化」と「狂気」の違いを考えている……場合によっては(設定によっては)龍之介の正気は狂化ではないけど狂気ではあるみたいなことになるかも……？？？
5842 2018-01-23 13:30:36 รู้สึกไม่มั่นใจในความรู้สึกของตัวเอง
5843 2018-01-23 13:30:31 Yes, this makes sense that he is doing this... Just a few weeks ago he said he wants offshore oil drilling in all coastal states excluding Florida. It's all about who is lining his coffers, and how much he will receive by doing it. You can buy this President's loyalty.
5844 2018-01-23 13:30:31 When are we going to enjoy fuel? 
Being one of the largest supplier of crude oil.
5845 2018-01-23 13:30:25 #Venezuela sees an almost 20% reduction in oil production between 2016 and 2017, down to 1.8 mbpd, with increased declines in its future. Time has come for new government that empowers, not represses the people.
5846 2018-01-23 13:30:18 Loving Vincent, my bro! It’s solid stuff. Entire thing is oil paint animation
5847 2018-01-23 13:30:11 US/UK want to own & control Syria because of oil & other assets. Military industrial complex benefits too, clearly.
5848 2018-01-23 13:30:02 OK
5849 2018-01-23 13:30:01 The irony of course being that you're just as captured, figuratively, by the oil/gas/extractive industries, Sir.

5857 2018-01-23 13:29:47 He's got to be getting kickbacks from oil and coal companies.trump again does everything in his power against environmentally friendly energy! Mother fuckin pig is destroying our environment and health he's complisit with any deaths from our environment 
5858 2018-01-23 13:29:42 Jojoba is pretty close to your skins natural oil! Also great for moisture everywhere!
5859 2018-01-23 13:29:39 You're completely right Jack. All these fans screaming FSG out are just blinkered. If they can't see how Klopp is building his team intelligently, then I despair. It seems most would prefer an oil baron to come in and bankroll us, whilst happily seeing the soul of the club vanish
5860 2018-01-23 13:29:18 I love the body oil too as it absorbs beautifully and the scent is amazing  x

5863 2018-01-23 13:29:06 Yeah but its with our own resources and money. The same thing that cannot be said by Oil Shitty..
5864 2018-01-23 13:29:05 Put them in the crock pot with butter and/or olive oil, and let them cook overnight. Simple and easy. I suppose that the Instant Pot faddists could use their toys to do the same thing.
5865 2018-01-23 13:29:00 Big oil sees solar energy as at threat to their dominance and has Trump put a 30% tariff on solar panels to stop consumers from using the sun.
5866 2018-01-23 13:28:53 No work in Scotland? Been more than plenty jobs for men in Aberdeen oil industry, starting from 80s. Would have made more dollars too, some friends of mine now on £12k a month.
5867 2018-01-23 13:28:30 Well surely you don't expect the corporations that just received a tax cut (they don't need), to pay.....No, no please allow the remaining middle class to foot the bill. Solar interferes with big money, like oil.
5868 2018-01-23 13:28:29 Coconut oil does the same thing
5869 2018-01-23 13:28:28 For oil and gas executives and billionaire's ...yes...
5870 2018-01-23 13:28:00 Don't be ridiculous - Denmark is a capitalist country with it's welfare system propped up by oil money. The oil is running out so we'll see how much you idolise it when it stops the welfare state...

5874 2018-01-23 13:27:48 Very shocked and offended that as an avid coffee drinker, no one told me putting coconut oil in your coffee has so perks 
5875 2018-01-23 13:27:29 Really! Olive oil
5876 2018-01-23 13:27:24 Oil, pipeline routes, banking and trade conducted outside of the petrodollar. Similar for Libya. 
The misrepresentation of both the regime and opposition. The opposition was initially painted as plucky pro democracy freedom fighters, the nature of some groups was downplayed.

5878 2018-01-23 13:27:07 The tariffs on solar panels are great news for Russian Oil producers and bad news for the environment. Your sponsor Putin will be pleased.
5879 2018-01-23 13:27:04 Not only is he trying to destroy America, he’s destroying the GOP. All this to benefit two lousy US solar companies? No. All this to benefit oil companies and his own pocketbook.
5880 2018-01-23 13:26:39 Motor oil is not a good substitute for Vasoline.
5881 2018-01-23 13:26:33 No question that he did this as a favor to the oil industry. Thank you sheeple and lollipops for enabling this as well as all the other despicable things that he has done against the people.
5882 2018-01-23 13:26:30 Guy in auto shop is covered in oil and whatever else just lit a cigarette. 
5883 2018-01-23 13:26:19 Bro coconut oil is really good for everything huh

5886 2018-01-23 13:25:39 Pre-market Natural gas up strongly, crude oil still flat, Bitcoin off nearly 500. Big oil up 1% to 2%.  DJI and Nasdaq positive to flat. S&P negative to flat.
5887 2018-01-23 13:25:33 Like chips but In the air fryer with a dash of olive oil and a good shake of seasoning! Delish & super more-ish!
5888 2018-01-23 13:25:31 His wife & daughters are Pro-Choice Republicans. They evolved as a family since GW’s presidency. I’m old enough to remember that his presidency was fueled by oil & greed, but I’m young enough to forgive & not hold a grudge. He can’t be that bad if Michelle Obama adores him.
5889 2018-01-23 13:25:31 He wants to get that Russian oil value up.
5890 2018-01-23 13:25:30 only thing work on my face is coconut oil 
5891 2018-01-23 13:25:17 Beware of Tillerson,  he is in it for big oil money.

5897 2018-01-23 13:24:32 Trump seems to think coal & oil are the big thing, almost like some rich people invested in those are controlling his actions. Oh ya, he also doesn't believe in climate change, so why promote/support the best possible renewable energy. Did no rich in solar donate money to him?
5898 2018-01-23 13:24:29 But the Problem for Americans is...

5954 2018-01-23 13:17:24 Doh.
RT@NOW1SOLAR: As a solar company, we are devastated that Trump has imposed a 30% tariff on solar panels virtually killing the solar industry. Solar employs more people than coal and oil combined. today's decision will cause the loss of roughly 23,000 American jobs this year.

5956 2018-01-23 13:17:18 that’s because he’s getting all that money from oil and coal interests

5971 2018-01-23 13:15:26 Coal/oil lobbyists pay for more politicians than the solar industry.  In Trump's eyes this is win-win.
5972 2018-01-23 13:15:26 นี่วางแผนอนาคตขนาดนี้เลยเหรอ

5978 2018-01-23 13:14:29 It’s the USA and UK who have caused so much mistrust of the West in the past and they’ve meddled in issues that didn’t concern them to control oil with no care for the Iranians.  It’s for Iran to sort it out but if they want help from the West they can ask for it.

5990 2018-01-23 13:13:17 I'd love to see the emails that inspired you to impose a 30% levy on solar that's going to cost upwards of 30,000 jobs just to keepthe oil and coal lobbies happy.

6035 2018-01-23 13:07:00 We are now starting to see the true costs of our decades of neglect of this issue. The time to start ramping up manufacturing infrastructure to make our own renewable systems was after the 1970s oil crisis. Now we’re a dollar short and an hour late.

6043 2018-01-23 13:05:43 Correlation is not causation. Price of oil is linked to supply and demand. Main reason for rise was cartelization of supply by OPEC.

6045 2018-01-23 13:04:57 @MBuhari is not @GEJonathan so continue looking for girls when the Borno governor is fighting for one Nigeria and his share of oil revenue
6046 2018-01-23 13:04:42 This is such an unconscionable and outrageous sellout of the environment and of the clean energy movement. Solely to hamstring a growing and progressive industry that’s cutting into the profits from coal and oil. This hurts everyone but the coal and oil people. #YESsolarNOcoal

Personally, I'd rather take info from a think tank founded by an oil company over one founded by someone who openly embraced eugenics and preserving the 'white-ethno' state. 
But hey, you do you.. I guess ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

6061 2018-01-23 13:03:05 I am interested in 1) What is RegionTrack’s funding source for this study; 2) What connections do RegionTrack have to oil & gas; 3) What does other research (perhaps outside of Oklahoma) show & compare; 3) Which elected officials get campaign $$ from oil & gas (and how much)

6070 2018-01-23 13:00:38 An oil company explosion, a massive earthquake/tsunami warning, tornadoes in TX, horrible things happening all over and @realDonaldTrump tweeting about texts and gloating on his shut down win. Sad day in USA & world.
6071 2018-01-23 13:00:38 NO!!! Any person that doesn't stand for something as in WOMEN'S right to CHOOSE will fall for anything. Best example ever is the GOP and their followers - they fall for snake oil called Trump
6072 2018-01-23 13:00:35 I don't know much about them, but it would be a nice "FU we're still green!" to the Oil Monster in Chief.
6073 2018-01-23 13:00:15 Yessssss...I'm finally going to get fuel. Just look at how excited i am, this is crazy. We produce so much oil and yet we can't have access to it whenever we want? What a time to be alive
6074 2018-01-23 12:59:47 Yea I usually do it after every oil change
6075 2018-01-23 12:59:44 We all have to pay for stuff we disagree with via our tax dollars: oil wars, freeways, meat eating.

6081 2018-01-23 12:58:56 Dermablend is great if you want full coverage and have dry skin. Horrible if you have oily skin tho. I really like Laura Geller's cover lock as well, and it's oil free. Both are very long lasting.
6082 2018-01-23 12:58:52 way to go.  Helping out big oil
6083 2018-01-23 12:58:47 Use coconut oil while in the shower and rinse it off then apply a moisturizer.
6084 2018-01-23 12:58:31 So true.  Meanwhile the rest of the world moves on.  So there will be with mountains of cool & oceans of oil with no outside market.  Also what of American car manufacturers?  To they get left behind too?  Or do they embrace progress & make oil less relevant even here???
6085 2018-01-23 12:57:58 2001/2017 ICE market paradigm (architect Gary Cohn) was Oil-as-Asset. Algo trading by OTC fund positions supported price via BWAVE.  Liquidity via Fed, then ECB.

6087 2018-01-23 12:57:42 Oh yeah, it’s super easy to make! So you coat the smooth side of the mushroom with olive oil, then put the spices of your choice, then you fry/grill it smooth side for 6-8 minutes, flip it if you want (I did and I cooked it for like 2 minutes), and that’s it!
6088 2018-01-23 12:57:30 +lemon juice & sometimes olive oil. @chrisJERICKno any fave recipes?

Solar employs more people than coal and oil combined. today's decision will cause the loss of roughly 23,000 American jobs this year. by #purplehayz

6112 2018-01-23 12:53:44 Can remember an old sayin, “Ownership is 9/10th of the law”
Right now WM owns the oil fields & portion them out to the oil companies at an agreed price All tax rev goes to WM. 
Here’s the complicated bit. When Scot is Indy, Holyrood will own the fields, set taxes and receive all

But when we're talking about a product, kena consider skin acceptance + other ingredients + concentration juga.

Mcm ada some takleh pakai product A tapi boleh pakai product B, padahal both contain mineral oil.
6119 2018-01-23 12:53:03 like oil?
6120 2018-01-23 12:52:26 It‘s quite easy to make new one by yourself. All you need is eggs, oil and some spices.

6122 2018-01-23 12:51:53 @BootsUK any chance you could stock Palmer’s Coconut oil hair care range? The cleansing conditioner is my go to and it would be lovely to be able to order it online with all my other products from you. Thanks

6130 2018-01-23 12:50:20 > and put them on a paper towel to sop up the oil (olive, of course). Then, toss your spices (cumin, cinnamon stick, cayenne, pepper) into the pan with the remaining onions for ~1m, then add dry rice and fry for ~1m. Then add damp lentils + 2-3 cups of water and cook for ~30.

6134 2018-01-23 12:49:35 I am going to need @josie_maran to put that 2017 reserve on sale. While you're at it, why not the face butter and Moonstone oil too!
6135 2018-01-23 12:49:32 If in fact this was an exercise it appears that oil is burning dangerously close to the sub itself. I don't see why they would have a real fire that close to the sub. What would even cause a fire in port so close to this and other substances. Unless running diesel mtr.
6136 2018-01-23 12:49:30 For every line of oil you should drink 8oz of water. #RIPFredo

6139 2018-01-23 12:49:06 what is under-recovery? So, if oil price continues to rise as anticipated, NNPC will continue to experience under-recovery till it bleeds to death. Mr Abiodun spoke as he was COMMANDED. Sad when men betray their conscience for the sake of temporal gains. What an insincere govt!!
6140 2018-01-23 12:49:05 The best moisturizer ive ever used is from the mens section and it is called bulldog oil control moisturizer and it really helped clear up the dry flaky skin I had on my face and the oily spotty bits? Its like £6 in boots but it goes on sale a lot so u can get it for £3 sometimes
6141 2018-01-23 12:49:02 I saw A question in latest issue about body oils being messy.  You recommended a couple balms.  I am very dry, don't like oil mess. Love Shea spray dry oil and Palmers is not dry but has bottle with tiny spout which works great@AprilFranzino
6142 2018-01-23 12:48:08 Similar issue. Maduro and his govt are similarly shitty, but the US invests a lot of money into so-called opposition, which openly plans to sell the nation's oil and natural resources off to the states the moment they take power.
6143 2018-01-23 12:48:01 วันนี้มีงานไง
6144 2018-01-23 12:47:54 Here is the thing with your 401k. Don't count your chickens before they hatch. In 2006 my 401k was worth 230k. By 2008 it was worth 68k. I am just saying don't use that as a barometer of greatness. ISIS is not gone. Russia is sending aid and oil to N Korea.
6145 2018-01-23 12:47:27 try maracuja oil (passionfruit oil) its amazing and won't make you break out even though its an oil

6148 2018-01-23 12:46:45 I wonder how much the oil companies shelled out to the GOP to convince them to institute high tariffs on solar panels
6149 2018-01-23 12:46:38 goddamn OIL PAINT MAN i will never get this outta my dam skin let alone my brushes
6150 2018-01-23 12:46:21 It seems he only cares when there's a possibility of profit, like oil drilling.
6151 2018-01-23 12:46:18 Find it amazing how a Tory right-wing Brexit, with people like Fox, and his connections to (ALEC...Oil, Tobacco and the NRA) can lead to so much vitriol towards an opposing government trying to deal with a referendum result, and limit their ability to destroy hard fought rights.
6152 2018-01-23 12:46:12 You own stock in Halliburton, which benefits from removal of oil industry safety regulations because of increased emergency response calls to put out fires at oil drilling rigs.  Your greed cost 5 citizens their lives 1-22-2018 in Oklahoma oil fields.

6154 2018-01-23 12:45:19 Interesting article! Thanks. There is a lot to be said for creating solutions based on a particular need and not trying to fit a product around what you think would be cool. As the oil set increases, the smart money will be on seamless integration
6155 2018-01-23 12:44:59 What I like about the #Mediterraneandiet is there is no calorie counting. I've gradually made small changes such as viewing vegetables as a main meal,drinking more water, using extra virgin olive oil, reducing sugar etc
6156 2018-01-23 12:44:53 Cheese shop, they also have stuff like olive oil and crackers and sour cream.

6166 2018-01-23 12:43:56 Stupid beyond belief on our part. Unless of course you happen to be in the coal or oil business... Hmmmm...
6167 2018-01-23 12:43:50 Yes, as well as cripple the solar industry (one of the fastest growing), cost thousands of jobs in that business, and prop up oil & gas interests. Washing machines were a by-product.
6168 2018-01-23 12:43:49 Economic argument for more pipelines is 20 years out of date.  The world is moving to renewables & electric cars.  There is surplus pipeline capacity now.  Empty pipelines won't grow the economy. All evidence points to sands oil fetching a lower price in Asia & Europe NOT higher.

6185 2018-01-23 12:41:55 So, let me get this straight. We have Global warning because of burning carbon fuels.. and our very own mentally deficient president puts high tariffs in a product that reduces carbon emissions and produces clean power as a favor to the oil industry?

He must be impeached!

6196 2018-01-23 12:40:54 Someone should tell Miller that white people outnumber natives in Alaska, and tell Trump that's where his buddies want to drill offshore. Don't tell him tsunamis are bad for oil rigs. You'll scare him.

6198 2018-01-23 12:40:50 What about your removal of oil industry safety regulations that caused 5 oil workers in Oklahoma to be killed yesterday? So Halliburton's emergency response company Boots & Coots could responding to more accidents making you more money?
6199 2018-01-23 12:40:48 Oil.... Tap that

6202 2018-01-23 12:40:17 It might depend on the skin because I used to use coconut oil to remove makeup and that’s when my skin was the clearest. But I am definitely going to try almond oil!

6210 2018-01-23 12:39:35 If I recall correctly it was in the news last week or the week before, that 45 wanted to give more money to oil/gas/coal to make it more competitive and provide more jobs. It's been part of the platform and we already provide alot of subsidies and tax breaks.
6211 2018-01-23 12:39:20 @mishshableski

Seriously is this wrong in any way about what is happening ?
How rudely true such a statement describe the situation on grounds.
Pathetic, shameful, outrageous
6214 2018-01-23 12:39:07 I should have guessed solar panels , electric cards ,anything big oil hates
6215 2018-01-23 12:38:54 @GM 

Took my SUV to @chevrolet service to have transmission repaired, two days after picking up, engine bay began smoking while driving to work, Oil leaking, window wash fluid cap is missing. I owned several chevy vehicles, but never again, very poor service.

6218 2018-01-23 12:38:21 2005 to 2012/13 we were vulnerable. Needed to buy and sell to fund stadium, so using Nasri etc to make your point is invalid. Profit  Wenger made on Anelka paid for our training facility - we used to share. We aren't funded by an oil state, we have to pay our way.

6220 2018-01-23 12:38:07 Well, Phillip didn't get the oil
6221 2018-01-23 12:38:05 Maybe he can have the Trump family companies goods produced in the USA? Hmmm. Jobs ask the solar companies he just imposed tariffs on how many jobs they'll lose so he can take care of his oil buddies.

6226 2018-01-23 12:37:25 And don’t forget 4) he’s not doing this to help US solar manufacturing, he’s doing it to help coal and oil people who give him money. The problem is more people work in solar than coal and oil combined.

6238 2018-01-23 12:35:25 Years ago, we were ahead of the Chinese in solar panel production. Exxon shut down there own program because oil was more profitable at the time. Now China is ahead. If we must have tariffs, why remove the tax credit?
6239 2018-01-23 12:35:16 *creeeeeeeeeeak* I need me some oil
6240 2018-01-23 12:35:08 Yes! Because with REDUCE-IT results, we’ll finally get a legit, scientific answer to the question: Does Rx pure omega-3 (fish oil) convey real cardiovascular benefit? I’m very happy $AMRN invested in this study.

6255 2018-01-23 12:33:27 How will the deregulation of oil companies by @realDonaldTrump help to regulate this?
6256 2018-01-23 12:33:23 Dems deserve that call out from Trump. This might be the most accurate tweet he’s posted. The lesson is, don’t negotiate with terrorists. The Dems won’t learn though. They’ll still negotiate with this snake oil salesman and wonder why they keep getting screwed. #DemsCave

6271 2018-01-23 12:30:48 Also today, @jonathanwatts  recaps what happened with the Iranian tanker spill in the East China Sea. He says now that the #Sanchi ship has sunk there are questions about how much oil is still inside the ship and continuing to seep out.
6272 2018-01-23 12:30:37 I find that for my atypical depression (I sleep and eat, vs insomnia and fasting), 1.5g/d of Omega 3 fatty acids is huge. EPA&DHA, 3 1g or so fish oil capsules. I like Trader Joe's best, a month worth is less that $10, and they don't stink of rotten fish (done do).

6315 2018-01-23 12:23:42 Opening up and developing offshore oil reserves helps America, puts Americans to work, reduces our dependency on Foreign Governments and keeps us strong. If it also earns money for Trump, great. It’s foolish to believe America can become great and not include Trump. MAGA
6316 2018-01-23 12:23:40 Here's the angle you need to point out: if you're going to impose tariffs because something is a foreign product, then that should apply to oil from Arabia. This is a move pushed by the coal industry.
6317 2018-01-23 12:23:38 Or the ones (especially those who experience moderate discomfort) that tell me that I'm too young to be in pain or that if they can push past it so can I. A natural anaesthetic I use for pain is peppermint essential oil because docs won't even look at me twice cause my age

6327 2018-01-23 12:22:23 As I am no expert either, they are both referred to as "rigs" and both drill to retrieve natural gas or oil.  While one may be offshore, the same rules will apply.  I do realize that I am not sure what caused the accident but fewer precautions are not good

6341 2018-01-23 12:20:45 Well, there would definitely be debt. What changes would you make to VAT and Corporation Tax, and what would be the ££ impact? What tax loopholes? How much would you reduce defence spending? How would you afford the capital to nationalise oil? 1/2
6342 2018-01-23 12:20:40 US stock futures are flat with Europe lower and Asia higher.  Oil is $63.80 with gold at $1,337. This is another wait and see day. 

I have a school hall meeting today at White County School District. I look forward to the opportunity to speak to the ATRS members there.

6355 2018-01-23 12:19:22 Swapping jobs in the coal and oil industries for jobs in renewables.  It would be interesting to see if there's any net gain.  Presumably Trumps pals in coal and oil will be better off.

 C2 (148,136) + C1 (129,658) = 277,794 total
 Based on oil priced at $63 = 1750boepd
 #PXOG’s 17.5% interest = 306boepd
 3x better than expected
 East Selva is supposed to be much larger

Cracking result for all involved. 
6376 2018-01-23 12:15:46 I'd like to see 2 different sources on those jobs numbers. Oil and gas is one of the largest employers in all of N.A. solar panel components are mined in poverty stricken countries and marked up at a premium to us as western buyers. Are we looking to help or take advantage?
6377 2018-01-23 12:15:44 Modi government is slowly and steadily losing middle class support due spiralling oil prices,which stressed poor & middle class people.High rate of sales tax or VAT in some states, particularly in BJP ruled states will contribute to this loss of support base.
6378 2018-01-23 12:15:36 Western vinaigrette: olive oil, vinegar or lemon, salt & spices.  Japanese vinaigrette: sesame oil, (sparing) vinegar or wasabi, soy.  I grew to love Japanese vinaigrette’s when living there.
6379 2018-01-23 12:15:36 You’re kidding right? We all know Trump has a huge political obligation to invest in coal/oil production over solar.
6380 2018-01-23 12:15:18 If they didn’t want coal or oil, than why didn’t they commit to no new coal or oil fired electrical plants in the Paris accords?
6381 2018-01-23 12:15:16 And we have an administration that wants to promote oil and coal. But then that's what they have money tied up in! So they have forward looking ideas and we are stuff in the black goo and lumps refineries

6417 2018-01-23 12:10:25 That is outright wrong. China & India are the fastest developing countries and both are largest buyers of Solar & renewable. They do not want oil or Coal, & Policy backs that commitment #MorningJoe

When are you going to launch #glutenfree menu items in the US? Overseas, the French Fries were #celiac safe, and we could go bun-less for a burger; sadly here in the states we can't enjoy the fries due to gluten in oil flavoring and risk of  cross contamination.
6437 2018-01-23 12:07:10 The fact is that coal and oil is going to be the energy of choice in developing countries and nations, such as China and India, in the whirlwind of their industrial revolutions, for many decades to come.

6439 2018-01-23 12:06:48 Because China, India, & France were never planning on Coal dependency anyway, they wanted Solar technology & have all begun to shut down Coal & Oil projects for renewable.

6484 2018-01-23 12:00:06 Like when Exxon bought the electrical component maker Reliant Electric to diversify because oil was going to run out. BP will sell at a massive loss in 5 to 7 years and get back into oil. Double down on oil. All the majors will.

6489 2018-01-23 11:59:37 In 2010 oil prices were near record levels and the poverty reduction of the Chavez era was still going strong. Regardless of the aftermath at that point there was justified praise for the gains that were made.

6499 2018-01-23 11:57:16 French oil firm Total SA has confirmed its commitment to the Lokichar to Lamu oil pipeline as the only evacuation route for Kenya’s crude from the Lokichar fields.
 
President @UKenyatta secured this commitment when he met Momar Nguer, a member of Total’s Executive Committee.

6502 2018-01-23 11:56:41 FIRS announced it made about N4tn in 2017 and the Customs N1. How much did the oil sector rake in, what about other income generating MDAs? Above all, how much was the total budget for 2017? With so much money and very little to show for it, Nigeria is certainly rich in poverty!

6506 2018-01-23 11:55:33 Did somebody mention.. carrot oil?
6507 2018-01-23 11:55:25 Yep. It's his way to possibly get jobs back for coal miners and his oil buddies like Sec of State Tillerson.
6508 2018-01-23 11:55:06 I can't possibly imagine how PSG get to sign players for £200m. Must be Arsene's fault. It's well known he's sitting on 2 million barrels of oil. Get out r club!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6509 2018-01-23 11:55:05 @RepBuddyCarter Are you dumb? No drilling = no risk of platform oil spills.
6510 2018-01-23 11:54:53 This doesn't help China. Their solar panels will be 30% more expensive now. American solar manufacturers usually buy panels from China. It will take years for domestic manufacturing to ramp up to replace the Chinese panels. During interim, Trump hopes to drive oil price up.
6511 2018-01-23 11:54:25 Assuming that socalled clean energy has or eventually will surpass this oil total. One corporate monster for another, on the backs of the taxpaying citizens. Public/private investiture is the biggest crock in our modern socioeconomic era. Lenin's melding of Marxism/capitalism!
6512 2018-01-23 11:54:24 Resolution? Just to change my oil when the sticker on the window says to.

6537 2018-01-23 11:48:37 No one wants oil other that US & Russia, that’s why even the Saudis are dumping their oil stock. India, China, Europe are all phasing out oil & are committed to renewable. Who will ANWR drillers export oil to when largest economies don’t want to buy it? #MorningJoe

6541 2018-01-23 11:47:46 Ain't that even ridiculous in the first place? We export crude oil and beg for refined oil to use because polithiefcians have ran our refineries berserk and chewed them. Shame of a nation!
6542 2018-01-23 11:47:39 abd responsible for that ! abd into the suria for OIL !
6543 2018-01-23 11:47:26 That's so weird you say that, as last Thursday I went to Christchurch and drove back via  Calshot to photograph it.  It was hard to get really good shots and I totally failed getting good ones of the oil refinery.

6553 2018-01-23 11:44:30 Is that a by product of oil? 
6554 2018-01-23 11:44:27 Did anyone talk to you about fish oil? Adding omega 3s to your diet definitely helps. Good luck with this.
6555 2018-01-23 11:44:17 Or mention that Big Oil was after another freebie there
6556 2018-01-23 11:44:13 What pointless drivel the energy switching thing is. Why are there allowed to be a million tariffs. Why not each company having one business & one domestic ? It's fucking snake oil is what it is 
6557 2018-01-23 11:44:03 Follow the oil.  Follow the sugar. Poke around in the hedge funds.  Keep an eye on the horseshoe.  Flick back through the photo albums to see who went on holiday and came back with new priorities and ideals.  Step back and look at the context.  Understand brexit.
6558 2018-01-23 11:43:29 Do you still use them? I use olive oil if i need to clean my ear or i go for an ear flush.
6559 2018-01-23 11:43:28 Have you looked at @RepRodBlum's financial disclosures? After elected, he kept dumping money in oil.
6560 2018-01-23 11:43:21 At 6:45 on 90.1 @wabenews:  A talk with GA Republican Congressman @RepBuddyCarter about the chances the GA coast will see oil and gas drilling.

6562 2018-01-23 11:43:14 Trump doesn't actually care about jobs. He cares about making himself and his friends in oil and coal money. Period. This will hurt everyone. It will further degrade the environment, already on the brink. What as a disaster.
6563 2018-01-23 11:43:04 Separate issue. The tariffs are to protect American manufacturers. That is completely separate from America becoming an energy exporter to rest of world including Eastern Europe to undermine the Russian oil industry
6564 2018-01-23 11:43:01 Good, now lets start talking about boiling oil and molten lead fountains.
6565 2018-01-23 11:43:00 Syrian Civil War started in 2011, Golan Heights oil discovery was in 2014 a day after this discovery USA, France, UK, Netherlands, Jordan, Germany and Norway all get involved in the war. Funny that eh.

6612 2018-01-23 11:36:16 Your comments are excellent. I would concentrate your comments on jobs created and savings in energy costs.  Trump loves oil and coal.  Your best chance at a reversal is to have the republican customers contact the White House.
6613 2018-01-23 11:35:37 Well isn't that special Trump put tariffs on solar panels to kill the alternative energy businesses in America the benefit the oil companies I guess. Thank you speech promising to move the embassy to Jerusalem will start a little Uprising in the Middle East winning bigly

6619 2018-01-23 11:34:12 Astonishing. Doesn't like competition for oil. Neither does Putin. These guys are a tag team. Tyrants and arrogance. No such thing as enough.

6626 2018-01-23 11:33:12 The only thing that bothers the British politicians and their lobbyists is simple. CRUDE OIL. The British embassy in Nigeria gave speech on IPOB, they have not said a word about the killings by herdsmen.

6631 2018-01-23 11:32:01 The price of gas will creep up in a good economy because business are using more oil globally with increased production.

6655 2018-01-23 11:28:50 I work in a grocery warehouse, if you smash a bottle of olive oil in the winter it looks almost like wet mash potatoes. Most of the stuff on your shelves is subject to extremely temperature in warehouses with no air conditioning or insulation. True story!

6662 2018-01-23 11:27:31 Gave up on the website of my favourite flavoured olive oil producer in Ostuni, southern Italy who it says do deliver to UK, maybe it was a tax number thingy and in the end had to resort to all praise be Amazon UK for a different brand
6663 2018-01-23 11:27:20 Abeg let them go and collect their share. After oil they drill oil from IMO and Abia. South South should get ready to go too.

6667 2018-01-23 11:26:27 Tainted trump is truly insane as he removes incentives to increase solar energy which preserves our environment & ends pollution. Why is he so beholden to Energy companies’ profiting off polluters oil and gas? Corrupt  & Tainted trump.
6668 2018-01-23 11:26:15 They just want the oil.
6669 2018-01-23 11:25:54 IIRC the movie Gladiator originally had a scene where Maximus advertises olive oil. This would have been historically correct, but the producers cut it because audiences would find it unrealistic.
6670 2018-01-23 11:25:51 not really a good idea to oil brakes if you ever want to use them to stop your bike.

6687 2018-01-23 11:23:03 @realDonaldTrump doesn't care about jobs! One of his cronies that gets paid by the oil & gas lobby told him to do this and he did it-without any research or other consideration. He doesn't understand solar energy & he doesn't use them on his projects, it won't affect him.
6688 2018-01-23 11:22:52 I just got fuel in my oil producing country and I feel like I just won a lottery.

6691 2018-01-23 11:22:38 I looked at their website for nutritional info of the Impossible Burger: in a 3 oz serving it has 10g saturated fat (3rd ingredient is coconut oil) and 430mg sodium. To compare, 80/20% hamburger has 7g saturated fat and 57mg sodium. But the Impossible Burger has 0 cholesterol.

6721 2018-01-23 11:19:00 Your imperialism is the reason for our economic instability. You empower corrupt governmental regimes in exchange for our oil (see Mohammed Bin Salmon, the prince of Saudi Arabia, who Trump is very much a fan of).
6722 2018-01-23 11:18:54 Regionally fragile but federally robust given diversity amongst the states. Government slow to act meaning it can't capitalise on opportunities + changing circumstances. Prone to cronyism and monopolies in both market and ideology. Oil dependence greatest indicator of fragility.
6723 2018-01-23 11:18:51 You know.... This is probably possible. I've seen vids about making lip gloss with coconut oil. I bet you could do some process similar to making canibutter with the coconut oil and use that to make lip gloss... Hmmm

1. Petrol/diesel prices hit highest level since BJP govt came to power in 2014, prompting oil ministry to seek a cut in excise duty.
2.  BJP govt had raised excise duty 9 times between Nov 2014 &January 2016 but cut the tax only once in Oct 2017 by Rs 2 per litre.

6896 2018-01-23 10:49:07 @Boilerjuice five weeks wait for oil. Now no oil no heating no hot water. Terrible service.
6897 2018-01-23 10:49:00 Why are no opposition parties, not a single one of them calling out the gov on checking Oil prices? Atleast Diesel should be regulated, because backbone of transportation, trucks, wagons etc is diesel. This will further inflate FMCG product prices.

6901 2018-01-23 10:47:09 If you have something plastic that squeaks, creaks or needs lubricating, what do you use?

I figured obv not oil, so I googled “silicone lubricant” and… did not find what I was looking for.

6906 2018-01-23 10:46:00 when will America realise that The greed for gas and oil sales through fracking is causing earthquakes?
6907 2018-01-23 10:45:58 Perhaps because it’s also rich in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, beans, and walnuts, as well. Dietary fruits and vegetables appear to provide some protection against the direct impairment of endothelial function produced by high-fat foods, including olive oil. .

6939 2018-01-23 10:39:42 I closed my accounts last year and have been much happier for it. Find a local credit union, there's a lot who give back to their communities and you have more of a say in policies like funding gucking oil pipelines that hire goon squads to beat up native Americans.

7033 2018-01-23 10:16:39 I am contenplating doing that too. As my editing skills improve, my older video's editing looks so bad to me. Like comparing crayons to oil paints. I removed a lot of old vides because of it. I would love to improve some of them and bring them back to life.
7034 2018-01-23 10:16:12 Yeah, we don’t need any burdens on oil companies, like #SafetyRegulations, right? Condolences to the families . Just awful.

7042 2018-01-23 10:14:51 Word of warning, the Saudis have just secured 100B in extra funding courtesy of Mohammad bin Salman’s corruption arrests.  It's possible that an oil price drop could be coming soon to allow them to secure market share at expense of Shale production.

7049 2018-01-23 10:13:56 One thing you may note: We don’t find oil in most calderas, for some obvious reasons. Off hand, I can’t think of any oil-producing calderas.

7118 2018-01-23 10:01:37 It is a great place for oil, but we dont want em drilling here.  Those oil rigs break like the one in the gulf, its gonna obliterate the largest stock of wild salmon and crab in the world.

7227 2018-01-23 09:35:06 I do hold. Bit of a slow burner. SP moves in phases. Partly a play on oil price. Lots of acquisitions and IT spend in 2017. Needs to demonstrate synergy. Either through revenue, GM or costs. Simple business. My current fair value 206p so not a decent MoS on new buys.

7317 2018-01-23 09:19:14 So many jobs... Wow Trump thanks! 

BTW, Trump imposed a 30% tariff on solar panels. Solar employs more people than coal & oil combined!

Job loss expected, 88,000 jobs nationwide, about 34% of the 260K Americans employed in solar in 2017. Let this sink in.
7318 2018-01-23 09:19:10 Crunch time approaching for #UKOG. They anticipated end of EXTENDED flow tests by end of January. Even if oil tankers were to appear now to take away any oil produced, how long could a test have been conducted for? Horse Hill produced for few hours, giving misleading flow rates.

7325 2018-01-23 09:16:40 Correct, wind is not a fuel source. Think about it. If air is not moving, it has zero kinetic energy. Also, if there's no sun, here's no radiant energy. Conversely, coal/oil/gas are defined as fuels by 'being' stored energy, released by chemical reaction (burning).

"I've been in dogecoin since 2007. "
"I've been mining Ripple for a few years now."
"If the gas efficiency wasn't just right, think of how much oil the GPUs would waste, it would cause the price of oil to go up."
7452 2018-01-23 08:48:17  I don't think you understand what a deficit is. Scotland may be "responsible" for that but isn't allocated it. P.s what country has the largest oil reserves in the world and how's it's economy doing?

7461 2018-01-23 08:46:40 I am open to letting us know which oil dependent country including those with massive infrastructure to support recovery has managed to turn the cord on the economic downturn. If not I guess all of them don't also know how to manage an economy
7462 2018-01-23 08:45:58 Refining cost of crude oil to petrol/diesel remains same. So we can compare crude oil price to petrol price. Can't we ?

7524 2018-01-23 08:36:55 Don’t worry. Takes logic to keep up. There are many jobs in the field of installing and maintaining solar panels. Lots and lots of jobs. Like a whole lot.

7605 2018-01-23 08:21:45 An excellent point. However, these days it is important to ensure that your #MustardOil is pure, cold-pressed oil, also known as kachchi ghani. There are, sadly, lots of fake oils with chemicals and artificial colours. Even the pungency is fake! Be careful.

7866 2018-01-23 07:24:33 @realDonaldTrump , Mr President, I think you should put pressure on OPEC  countries, stop them from jacking up oil price and hurt US economy.  I fully support you.

7870 2018-01-23 07:23:57 Hmmm, it’s as if he’s beholden to the oil industry. Not to mention the booming coal industry and all the mining jobs he brought back.  Both of those coal jobs. 
7871 2018-01-23 07:23:09 Fully agree. The YPG needs to grow up and understand that using ISIS tribes to grab Syria's oil and setting up a US puppet separatist state has consequences. Yes, Russia is using the Turkish barbarians against YPG just like YPG used ISIS against Syria. Retweet from @agitpapa
7872 2018-01-23 07:23:03 He just doesn’t get the idea that coal is dead, and oil is dying. This will seriously harm sustainable energy investment. A stupid move.

7886 2018-01-23 07:19:40 I don't know if there is anything we can get right in this country, even crude oil that we own is punishing us. We have an administration that is defensive in all fronts rather than being proactive on domestic issues.

8003 2018-01-23 06:57:22 Iv been reading in to a fork oil change, my bikes on 15k and never had it done that I know to and iv had her since 9k just need a front stand, seems quite straight forward.. (probabaly just jinxed myself) 
8004 2018-01-23 06:57:19 We’ll the idea is that you can recuperate your losses if shit happens vs. Taking out a years salary in creditcard debt and blowing it on shorting oil
8005 2018-01-23 06:57:19 Prepare now for Oil Opportunity pull out in today's New Vision. i was in Khartoum in 2008 and l was impressed by their refinery for domestic use and for neighbors. We should learn from them now that we have cordial relations.

8013 2018-01-23 06:56:28 Don't mistake what I meant, this doesn't refer to oil being refined intra-country. I mean #Libya supplies crude to the world but fails to supply citizens with gas (& basic needs). 
Libya is the only rentier country in the world where citizenship comes with 0 benefits.
8014 2018-01-23 06:56:26 This looks interesting I always find an oil great to remove stubborn make up

8020 2018-01-23 06:55:40 This action is typical of an arrogant, l stupid jackass who is against then use of clean renewable energy sources. This is his way of attempting to force people to use dirty oil and coal.
8021 2018-01-23 06:55:27 There is no need to watch him closely, while an oil price decision based on market , so what he'll do. States only fills their pocket by VAT. No need to be concerned about the  price. What is stopping them to put oil under GST ?

8085 2018-01-23 06:43:10 Trust is the new oil. In the last few elections the usage of trust had huge impacts on the results. Whoever will manage to control trust will be incredibly powerful. Losing trust is the obvious consequence of misusing it....
8086 2018-01-23 06:42:41 So sorry to hear this! We should be supporting green energy with everything we have! This is obviously an attempt to fill the coffers of big oil. Shameful by @realdonaldtrump.

8088 2018-01-23 06:42:14 But it's a huge impact to the solar industry & renewable energy markets! More expensive for homeowners & businesses, 20,000+ jobs potentially lost. And they'll use the drop in renewable energy to push coal, oil & fracking agenda!

8095 2018-01-23 06:40:59 Oil down again , may be due to pressure., they extended production cut , may implied volume shrink again.
8096 2018-01-23 06:40:22 People here look at me weird when I say “all y’all” instead of all of you or “ol” instead of oil...then try to correct me...for the love of God I can’t help it, I’m sick of it, YOU CAN TAKE THE GIRL OUT OF TEXAS BUT YOU CAN’T TAKE TEXAS OUT OF THE GIRL!
8097 2018-01-23 06:40:17 Hmm. I’m seeing arguments against coconut oil on skin... is that full body or just face? I use coconut oil fresh out of the shower & my skin is soooooooft. No lotion ever got me feeling like a rose petal.
8098 2018-01-23 06:40:17 Again with your soy fetish. I don't know what that is. Sounds like you want to oil someone up.
8099 2018-01-23 06:40:16 Unless its infused body oil, you actually place a dose under your tongue & try to hold it there for at least 30sec.Preferable 1-2 min. Then u swallow it.Typically that is done 2-3 times a day.Or many u can vape which makes it kick in faster which is better for migraine attacks

8109 2018-01-23 06:38:16 And what tell about oil breaks? About gas extraction zones? They're too bad for the planet, along time, but we still use them. There isn't exists a perfect energy source (for moment), and #nuclear is the best one we know.

8194 2018-01-23 06:19:51 Taxpayers currently subsidize the oil industry by as much as $4.8 billion a year, with about half of that going to the big five oil companies—ExxonMobil, Shell, Chevron, BP, and ConocoPhillips—which get an average tax break of $3.34 on every barrel of domestic crude they produce.

8221 2018-01-23 06:16:53 It’s of course complicated and not consistent. Alaska is desperate for revenue now, even if they also acknowledge they desperately need to make the transition from a fossil fuel economy. Let’s hope helps keep the oil companies out of especially sensitive places like ANWR.

8241 2018-01-23 06:13:22 100% true. The US economy has operated on something called the Petrodollar for approx the last 40 years. A scam currency used to manipulate global oil prices. That is coming to an end, and with it, will come the total collapse of the US economy. It will be a sad story.

8258 2018-01-23 06:10:23 If MJ helped then CBD oil should help. Just check on if it is legal in ur state & make sure what u get is from hemp not MJ. Many states only allow that kind.

8261 2018-01-23 06:10:18 it is essential that oil production increase to 15 million barrels per day to support economic expansion. Oil will be almost worthless in 30 years and sitting on it does not make sense.

8285 2018-01-23 06:06:34 If your organization cared about #climatechange you wouldn’t stack #Congress with deniers to satisfy your trust buddies in the oil lobby. Real solutions will never come to fruition as long as you people continue to ravage our democracy and scientific institutions.

8290 2018-01-23 06:05:46 Let me put it this way. NK is a  Chihuahuas. America is a Mastiff, backed by every other country in the region not that we need that or their intel but I would never turn it down either. SK just stopped 2 oil tankers for NK from China see what's happening here?
8291 2018-01-23 06:05:27 Something needs to be done about fuel prices, I thought we have oil, why it getting more expensive by the day?  Am about to park my car. #Fuel

8322 2018-01-23 06:01:22 In a couple of years we'll be learning how the canola/sunflower/soy oil industry shifted blame to sugar. Those oils, by the way, are in 95% of junk foods.

8337 2018-01-23 05:58:31 The tariff on solar panels isn’t sbout protecting solar panel jobs but about protecting big oil & coal.  This will slow solar use and cost installation & sales jobs in solar industry.. Good luck

8340 2018-01-23 05:58:12 Please read the thread--very important details revealed about solar industry, and the ways in which oil and gas are SUBSIDIZED by tax dollars, far exceeding any expenditure of solar. We must fight this.

8353 2018-01-23 05:55:10 That foundation must be in the Atlantic. Because all I see is fulaniconomics in practice. Colonies for people's personal business!!! The foundation could not be better. South south will also ask for oil colonies, looks to me they have a greater threat
8354 2018-01-23 05:55:09 It’s kind of amusing that @googlemaps thinks that all the oil companies in downtown Calgary are gas stations.

8361 2018-01-23 05:53:21 fine. threepio has, ugh, pleasure sensors (we know he enjoys oil baths, and can feel them.) can we agree chewie gives him such oil baths and that’s the extent of their physical intimacy?
8362 2018-01-23 05:53:16 Textbook definition of stupidity. Increase coal, oil and fossil fuels and tax green energy. He’s 40 years behind the times.

8369 2018-01-23 05:52:09 Hi SH. Hope u are well. Of course these companies are gonna complain. That whole industry is a farce. Invest in oil, powerless transfer companies and 3 d printing tm and you will be able to retire in 5 years.

8372 2018-01-23 05:51:12 Essential oils and warm coconut oil. Boyyyyyy. Your body will feel like it’s on cloud 9.
8373 2018-01-23 05:51:03 They killed plans to manufacture solar panels in Arizona a couple years ago. Republicans bitch about not having jobs, then kill every opportunity for new business. We could've used those jobs but I'm pretty sure some politicians were bought off to preserve oil and coal interests.
8374 2018-01-23 05:51:02 and my argument is that #usa supported rise of #china 30yrs via FREE #oil #gas #LNG security by @usnavy in #shipping from mideast; of course gotta consider the alternative ;) but baker FORCED #japan pay for gulfwar'91 &surely could get $$ from #china too

If you have something go on definitely message me if you're scared and want to talk it over, I know what
8377 2018-01-23 05:49:43 All by design. Many people with interests in oil & coal are still controlling policy!
8378 2018-01-23 05:49:38 #ERMSLegSim Just a little lead cause the horrible water crisis in Flint, Michigan.  Imagine what a little oil could do if an accident happens!
8379 2018-01-23 05:49:27 I totally agree! What works for her or me may not work for others. People have to understand you can’t just slab a whole bunch of oil on your face either lol

8386 2018-01-23 05:48:09 #ERMSLegSim The oil reserve is directly under a very diverse, rare, and fragile ecosystem.  Great care must be taken to preserve the land.  It's also close to the Atlantic Ocean.  We don't need another #BPOilSpill2010

8391 2018-01-23 05:47:18 I invested a fair amount into skincare and hair products for years before realizing that I can just slather coconut oil over my entire body
8392 2018-01-23 05:47:12 @realDonaldTrump You CLAIM to be pro American Worker YET you throw a 30% tax on solar??? Solar employs more Americans than oil & coal combined! You clearly HATE America, you could give a fuck about workers & its abundantly clear that you only care about yourself.

8394 2018-01-23 05:47:06 As someone in the auto industry solar has massive potential for supplemental charging of electric vehicles. Vehicles im sure GOP would love to halt in their tracks. We’d be much further along if oil companies hadn’t been buying up battery patents anytime one showed real potential
8395 2018-01-23 05:46:52 Let’s see what would the Koch Bros and Russian oil oligarchs do? Hmmm...
8396 2018-01-23 05:46:46 hoeing has proven itself to be helpful again today because without all the variety of dicks i have had, how would i know how much ingredients i need when the recipe calls for 1 inch of oil in the pan WHEN I HAVE NO MEASURING UNITS AVAILABLE ????
8397 2018-01-23 05:46:42 This new oil I got smell sooo bomb
8398 2018-01-23 05:46:37 Quick tip for all my naturals out there! When straightening or using heat on your hair please do not saturate your hair with an oil use a proper heat protectant. When you heat oil it is meant to cook and Fry things!! Which causes heat damage. Use it after styling #hair #haircare
8399 2018-01-23 05:46:22 Like its palm oil from ore ?
8400 2018-01-23 05:46:16 Seems this oil is pretty good after going through your review, thanks for sharing!

8406 2018-01-23 05:45:09 Coconut oil isn’t even the best oil. My longtime friend sweet almond oil is here and she’s ready for her close up.
8407 2018-01-23 05:45:01 350's especially but the year is new i can't settle with a oil problem 350 lmfao
8408 2018-01-23 05:44:39 You're too late to the game and oil is getting more subsidies. You're not cost-effective, so this might be a death-blow to your solar industry.
8409 2018-01-23 05:44:39 I am with you on Global sustainability, but can I please enrich myself first? I am on the phone with a palm oil agent in Sumatra. I’ll  get back to you later.  @alexandergoslar @jrockstrom

8415 2018-01-23 05:42:57 @David_Cameron Nigeria your slave plantation is a shithole because of you slave masters imperialism. Harold Wilson starved to death 5 million Biafran women and children to death so that slave masters British can have oil.
8416 2018-01-23 05:42:57 INEXCUSABLE ... $$$ for his damn "oil/gas" payoffs in his pocket!

I like oil , so let's mess with solar , green freaks anyway 
How about farmers ,get rid of NAFT.   Corn and beans

8442 2018-01-23 05:39:56 More than anything, I'm just tired of how DUMB Trump is. He just likes or doesn't like random stuff, and we all have to suffer for it. Solar has no downside. Purely a move to please asshole oil barons instead of real Americans.
8443 2018-01-23 05:39:49 Alexis chose money by moving to United instead of City? 
Facts:
1. Upgraded from 13-titles-club to 20. City is a downgrade (4?).
2. Utd earn real profits, City invested by oil.
3. Utd may come 2nd this season with team still in progress instead of instant trophy at City.
8444 2018-01-23 05:39:37 Time to address fuel prices? Oil companies need to cut gas prices with tax cuts they've received? High prices reduce income Americans could have kept pocketed?
8445 2018-01-23 05:39:33 Just go eat a boot at that point.

But yeah, I prefer to cook it in butter. 

Oil just isn't the same.

Start at high heat to sear that bitch, then drop to medium heat for a minute or so, season to taste before it hits the pan also.

8456 2018-01-23 05:37:50 It tricks you w the name! It’s not actually an oil it just has tea tree oil in it. It dries completely in seconds and it actually has oil-absorbing powders that removes excess oil w/our drying your skin :)
8457 2018-01-23 05:37:40 My brother has a bad blackhead problem and my cousin has cystic acne. Both on medication with no result. I got them cleansing with olive oil and tea tree and a ACV clay mask and slowly seeing results

8567 2018-01-23 05:18:24 So funny. The corrupt PCs were bleeding us dry. Cronyism rampant. Major waste of cash as noted in audits. Then the small matter of little in return for our oil and gas. Iwonder about the Tapcal Trust Fund as well. @jkenney Who paid into this fund? What did they get in return?
8568 2018-01-23 05:18:22 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.

8571 2018-01-23 05:18:13 I am a big fan of The Ordinary line of skincare because they make a concerted effort to break down what everything is doing. They sell most treatments individually vs a blend of all things anti aging/problem solving/snake oil seeming. You can tailor it to your needs.
8572 2018-01-23 05:18:06 Ever since I started using my essential oil diffuser when I go to sleep, I can't sleep without it 
8573 2018-01-23 05:18:00 History will be kinder to Dr. Manmohan Singh who tackled the price of petrol under ₹67 even when Crude oil was $118, while modi govt made it go about ₹80 even when crude oil is $68 only and before it was even lower to $50 when iran was unbanned to sell oil.
8574 2018-01-23 05:17:54 Hi Kelly. I just saw ur tweet. My mom (83) has Alz & Dementia & I've just started her on CBD oil. Do u have a lot of knowledge &/or experience w this type of stuff? I'm just pretty much winging it & guessing. Any advice or help would be so much appreciated. Thank you....Cindy
8575 2018-01-23 05:17:52 While getting rid of the very INDUSTRY that deals with outdoor products to help GAS/OIL!  @ABCWorldNews @BearsEars16 @ap @sltrib
8576 2018-01-23 05:17:49 Well it's like. If you want to see oil paintings, you wouldn't want to include a diorama that has some oil paint. Just like how  Pixel Art is different than Art With Some Pixels
8577 2018-01-23 05:17:47 I smell like tea tree oil 
8578 2018-01-23 05:17:43 Nothin like doing some half naked yoga poses covered in peppermint oil trying to get your kid to turn head down instead of totally sideways

8580 2018-01-23 05:17:32 @Abhinavrt Sir, To this day even state owned oil PSU's remain non committal to following safety norms as prescribed by the MB Lal Committee Report a decade back
8581 2018-01-23 05:17:08 Does the gov charger 30 % extra TAX on foreign / imported oil? Would just be logic and could help to go energy efficient in the end.
8582 2018-01-23 05:16:54 Don't forget BNP #Paribas in France either;  they added their voice to the same "narrative" but it's important to remember, last year they announced they would no longer lend or invest in anything to do with oil & gas.  Naturally a good reason to promote a bearish narrative, eh?
8583 2018-01-23 05:16:53 Destroying the renewable energy industry to appease the Koch Brothers, TB Pickens and Big Oil is also a big deal.  What a joke! #Romney 2020.

8587 2018-01-23 05:16:40 Somebody in oil has him in his pocket, no doubt.
8588 2018-01-23 05:16:40 This piece of news actually hurt. As in I felt pressure in my heart. What a crass mistake. What an egoist! He must have some sort of deal with oil companies or even Russia, to make it unaffordable to access renewable energy! Feel like I’m in a bad dream being dragged backwards!

8592 2018-01-23 05:16:30 .@davidfrum Please follow the money in the #SolarTariffs. Some unusual activity going on.  Who is going to benefit. It’s not about oil, coal or even solar.
8593 2018-01-23 05:16:30 Open twitter. See hundreds of people viciously arguing about the effects of coconut oil. Close twitter.
8594 2018-01-23 05:16:25 Totally agree! In fact the solar energy industry employed 2x as many people as coal, and about 2/3 of the oil industry. If you add wind energy, the jobs equaled the oil industry. And this industry is GROWING. Drives me nuts that people can’t see this.
8595 2018-01-23 05:16:14 My coworker gave me lotion with cannabis seed oil in it and I love it  tried getting my nina to use it and she won’t go near it

8598 2018-01-23 05:16:00 Well said, Brittany. Sessions and his co-conspirators thought they would get away with conspiring regarding the Rosneft oil deal at the Mayflower Hotel on 4/27/16. I’m sure Mueller has all the details since Comey knew Sessions would need to recuse before Sessions actually did.

8602 2018-01-23 05:15:08 This is why Putin &oil oligarchs put him in power: save obscene profits of dying oil industry.

We must fight him. God commanded care for the earth. It's the only one we've got.
8603 2018-01-23 05:14:55 Well, first the earth cooled. And then the dinosaurs came, but they got too big and  fat, so they all died and they turned into oil. And then the Arabs came  and they bought Mercedes-Benzes. And Prince Charles started wearing all  of Lady Di's clothes. I couldn't believe it.

68$ crude oil अगर ₹30/ltr आताहे तो 120$ मे जरूर वो करीब ₹55होना चाहिए। ₹55+tax+del com.+ex duty सब मिलाकर ₹71 मे कांग्रेस सरकार पेट्रोल दे रहीथी।पर ये लुटेरा मोदी सरकार लोगों से ₹30का तेल को ₹71 लेकर लोगों का पैसा खाकर  विदेश घुम रहा हे।

So far no one notice the switch in oil! So tast wise still yum! Cost extra 1p! It’s super easy

8639 2018-01-23 05:10:35 He’s trying to kill renewable alternatives to oil for his buddies. It won’t work. Solar panels make too much sense and we make them right here in California. We’ll just make more.
8640 2018-01-23 05:10:34 I figured that was the case. Massachusetts is very cold and the majority of homes get their heat from oil

8646 2018-01-23 05:09:32 I wish the media pushed to call him out in his lies. Trump couldn’t handle tough questions from anyone. He’s getting off the hook. Meanwhile Obama and Bush W got killed for small things and Trump is shoving Sanders out there to sell snake oil. Little accountability for lies.
8647 2018-01-23 05:09:26 It is a shame that all that matters to us is oil.  Oil itself is on the brink of losing its value, since there is a move to make automobile work on electricity.  We really have to start thinking beyond oil.  The black gold is becoming less and less important today.

8653 2018-01-23 05:08:58 In general I think govt has overreached so I am in favor of de- regulation. 

Re: EPA. We might have gone too far. I think Mr. Obama went way too far one way and now Mr. Trump may have swung too far the other way. Def not in favor of having a big oil man running that.
8654 2018-01-23 05:08:39 You feel naked and exposed by all this really concrete evidence of actually felonies and treasonous behavior and snake oil bullshitcom artistry and you desperately want to have something to even the score. That thing doesn't exist, so you settle for pushing some fabulist tripe.
8655 2018-01-23 05:08:28 dry undereyes? Add a drop of Arian oil under your eyes. Tap in. Apply makeup after 10 minutes. (make sure your undereyes are set properly tho) then thank me later.
8656 2018-01-23 05:08:13 RT gypsychick76: AMC_Signpost 420Tasmania seems counteractive to keep jailing our most experienced cannabis oil producers rather than bringing them in as consultants and benefiting from all that knowledge and experience
8657 2018-01-23 05:08:08 So glad babe finally got the job he has always wanted to do at the oil fields and more since he gets to be more time at home now
8658 2018-01-23 05:08:00 These countries and so other oil nations are rich and have moral responsibility to keep refugees from middle East. That would be good to all. Win win deal.

8660 2018-01-23 05:07:44 Yes and now many workers are still missing after an explosion on an oil tanker.  Good thing we got rid of safety regulations for workers!
8661 2018-01-23 05:07:41 Tank is fairly new, when I had pulled old out of ground, fine print in ins policy wouldn't cover a leak if a new oil tank wasn't installed before in ground tank was removed. Scumbags 
I am going over to gas soon.
8662 2018-01-23 05:07:38 i....love putting coconut oil on my face and i feel so ugly for it now. like i know it’s not really a moisturizer but it makes my skin so smooth when i wash it off

When it's really bad I wrap plastic (yes you read that right) and socks overnight but usually just socks do the trick.
8670 2018-01-23 05:06:47 @realDonaldTrump is a scared little street walker for the Oil & Gas Cartel. Whether it's RExxon Tillerson, Guvnuh Perry & the rest of the #TrumpSwampCult & #ClimateChange deniers or His Majesty The Great Pornstar Payoff Psychotic Pervert, we should be glued to his insane tweets.

8675 2018-01-23 05:06:03 I tried using coconut oil as a makeup remover once and got cystic acne 
8676 2018-01-23 05:05:39 Whoa. I thought he might do this - it's a way to help the coal/oil people and a way to buy less stuff from China. If they're going to do this though they should redirect those subsidies to American solar panel manufacturing.  Still though, it's incredibly short-sighted.
8677 2018-01-23 05:05:37 Your MCM taking pictures of his car while it’s up on the rack at pep boys talkin bout “Getting baby the oil change she’s been needing”, what a fuckin man you have.

8684 2018-01-23 05:04:07 I wonder if #DontheCon's 30% tariff on solar panels has anything 2 do with 

1. the transfer of 15% of Russian oil company 2 secret owner (Trump?). . . or

2. China becoming a world leader . . . or

3, news of China targeting @jaredkushner.

I'm going with No. 1

8688 2018-01-23 05:03:21 As a solar company, we're devastated to learn Trump has imposed a 30% tariff on solar panels virtually killing the solar industry. Solar employs more people than coal & oil combined. Decision will cause the loss of roughly 23,000 American jobs this year. RT @NOW1SOLAR
8689 2018-01-23 05:03:09 FYI. Alternative energy gets way more subsidies than oil and coal.
8690 2018-01-23 05:02:56 Solar has 7X more jobs than coal in this country, and 2 X as many jobs as gas & oil industry. It’s growing and good paying jobs. Trump is trying to kill a growing segment of our economy and Gopd jobs for Americans!
8691 2018-01-23 05:02:42 do you like his de-regulation?  those frighten me.  Some maybe justified--I will admit that.  But he's gone too far in other direction IMO--like putting a climate change denial, oil man in charge of the EPA.
8692 2018-01-23 05:02:38 so i use baby oil for my body & jergens for my face. well i just put my face on my oily ass arm  FML .

8696 2018-01-23 05:02:17 That's my oil on fire dammit!
8697 2018-01-23 05:02:10 Do remember, India imports 90%of fuel to meet the demands, price fluctuate depending on crude oil prices, irrespective of the parties, no proper  understanding between state and central government to reduce the different types of taxes..

8702 2018-01-23 05:00:44 Your MCM on IG tryna flex posting pics of random pumping units in the oil fields talking bout “that oilfield money is what I’ve been needing” he’s a firewatch.

8704 2018-01-23 04:59:52 He's tight buddies with the oil industry of course he doesn't want clean energy.  This guy is a nightmare to the environment and those trying to update to renewable energy.
8705 2018-01-23 04:59:44 coconut body oil is the best.
8706 2018-01-23 04:59:41 Must sell that Russian Exxon oil waiting to be pumped as soon as Mr Trump lifts all sanctions. The solar industry employees more then coal oil and gas combined in the US. Countries are moving towards renewables and away from fossil... even oil rich countries. This is 
8707 2018-01-23 04:59:36 Looks like I’ll be adding more cardio and water and cutting out salt and oil 
8708 2018-01-23 04:59:25 When you have to have two bottles of oil to oil all your boots
8709 2018-01-23 04:59:23 Oil leak?
8710 2018-01-23 04:59:21 Kinda hate myself for not sticking with oil paint after learning its techniques.
8711 2018-01-23 04:59:19 I put coconut oil on my face almost every night and my skin is like perfect
8712 2018-01-23 04:59:17 Gisa mo lang friend onting oil lang sibuyas lang nilagay ko eh. Tas imbes karne tufo hinalo ko hahahah Rapsa naman kase may curry powder. Lol! Mas healthy hahahaha
8713 2018-01-23 04:59:16 If anyone wants to go with me tomorrow to get my oil change plz let me know bc im the biggest scaredy cat when it comes to doing adult things alone :-))
8714 2018-01-23 04:59:12 Putanginang gravy sa ged & barts lasang 7 day old canola oil tska butter lang na pinaghalo hanggang naging malapot putangina
8715 2018-01-23 04:59:09 I just want to say that I did plenty of research on YouTube b4 I even touched oil paints. I started from scratch, I searched “dumb” questions like “what’s the difference between acrylic & oil” “ what are mineral spirits” etc etc, point is, I wanted to learn something new
8716 2018-01-23 04:58:50 How is this a surprise to anyone? 
Just think about what makes Afrin different from east Euphrates...
Syria has oil, Afrin doesn't. 
8717 2018-01-23 04:58:46 The sound of rain, oil diffuser going (so much better than a candle) my room is clean, I have my week planned out... sometimes it’s the little things that make life seem a little less shitty 
8718 2018-01-23 04:58:42 That's your story and you will stick with it.  That statement may be true in the short term but we know from experience the costs will escalate. Big will buy or force small out of business, raise prices. Or they will price fix. Look at debit card & bank fees. Oil and gas prices
8719 2018-01-23 04:58:41 pernah nyobain victoria secret body mist (ini yg plg affordable dan banyak pilihan di tw ) trus aku beralih ke tbs strawberry body mist sekarang  penasaran sm tbs white musk perfume oil tapi rodo pricey

8721 2018-01-23 04:58:10 Lorenzo's oil...⚘
8722 2018-01-23 04:58:07 Thanks, bub. I’m rusty, but getting out the oil can.
8723 2018-01-23 04:58:03 I'm pro renewables & anti oil, but I think he's  referring to source of electricity (possibly coal) & manufact'g.
8724 2018-01-23 04:57:43 They made it completely aware that exxon mobile (USA) continued to deal for oil in Libya even after the fall of Gaddafi regime$$$
8725 2018-01-23 04:57:32 If they want to make a municipal impact, why not offer incentives to Saanich residents to change out their oil furnace for a heat pump?
8726 2018-01-23 04:57:14 As I literally just fucking put coconut oil on my face i seen this haha
8727 2018-01-23 04:57:12 Cause he needs coal & oil industries 2keep 1% $$$ flowing. GOP all have assets in those 2. Solar young & less lucrative at the moment. It's the future $$$ it will take from coal & oil. Those industries will lose in the end. Trying to prolong the inevitable. Revolution change.
8728 2018-01-23 04:57:05 As a solar company, we are devastated to learn Trump has imposed a 30% tariff on solar panels virtually killing the solar industry. Solar employs more people than coal and oil combined. today's decision will cause the loss of roughly 23,000 American jobs this year.
8729 2018-01-23 04:57:04 Done. Finally. Just need to go wash some of this oil off me. – bij Union Pacific

Great meeting with Tim Smith at @BP_UK today to talk about the current state of the oil and gas sector as well as BP’s future investment plans for the North Sea. Lots of life and opportunity in the UKCS yet! 
8732 2018-01-23 04:56:53 the guy who works next to ME IS SO FUNNY HE ALWAYS YELLS DURING WORK SO ALM I HEARD TODAY WAS “yes the fuck i do bitch” “ you got me fucked up i’m gonna drop oil all over the fucking floor so you fuckin slip” i wish i worked next door with him 
8733 2018-01-23 04:56:43 Try rubbing  olive oil on stomach. It soothes aches.
8734 2018-01-23 04:56:17 I hope your oil pipeline explodes bitch
8735 2018-01-23 04:55:52 Made the nicest slice last night..

Peanut butter, dark chocolate, roasted almonds/sunflower seeds, vanilla bean paste, rosemary, decanted coconut, oats, coconut oil and honey

Consistency is good and flavors blend really well .... and Mumsy approved 
8736 2018-01-23 04:55:50 I used to think that essential oils and diffusers were snake oil but now I can’t sleep without having my diffuser on with some Eucalyptus in there. The white noise + the natural scent = good sleeps
8737 2018-01-23 04:55:38 Ppl want stronger immigration laws and border security. DACA should be more humble and less demanding and arrogant. Not making friends.
8738 2018-01-23 04:55:31 Hello
8739 2018-01-23 04:55:21 for perspective on #Trump at #Davos  consider disgraced past attendees: Diezani Alison-Madueke (ex Nigerian oil minister), Ali Zeidan (ex Libyan PM), Almir Barbassa (ex Petrobras CFO),  Malysian PM Razak of 1MDB fame...amazing galaxy of crime!  #crookDavos
8740 2018-01-23 04:55:12 Wash your face every night,spray your face with rose water(helps get rid of scars), put toothpaste on any zits you have before bed and let it dry while you sleep. Wash your face in the morning. Put tea tree oil on any red spots you have in the morning
8741 2018-01-23 04:54:53 Already tried it, didn't work out too well
8742 2018-01-23 04:54:40 Day 2: Last night I dreamt someone cooked my sweet potato in oil. I almost cried. #whole30
8743 2018-01-23 04:54:37 @TylerBaltierra I emphasize with not sleeping. I’ve had insomnia for over 10 years. It’s awful. Try Trazadone or CBD oil. Best of luck.
8744 2018-01-23 04:53:43 No. They look ''successful'' because there is order but with christianity pastors do whatever they want, they use doom, grass, excessive prophesying, even prophesying about your underwear, water, oil, salt, candles. Anything goes really
8745 2018-01-23 04:53:40 @chengela Volcanic Aerosols must be injected into dirty coal, gas stations selling dirty gasoline, oil refineries, and stores selling dirty charcoal in big cities!
8746 2018-01-23 04:53:35 .@MikeBloomberg It is not about oil. Follow the money. Who owns the companies that will benefit from the tariffs.
8747 2018-01-23 04:53:22 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
8748 2018-01-23 04:53:10 You gotta level up from the gas man, gotta hop on da pure oil
8749 2018-01-23 04:53:09 Ouch
8750 2018-01-23 04:53:01 Some job creation, huh?  Way to help the environment, too, eh?  He's a complete bozo.  Just there for big oil, coal, and all that's wrong.
8751 2018-01-23 04:52:48 True life: I’m addicted to my oil diffuser
8752 2018-01-23 04:52:46 Trump handed China the opportunity to make billions and trillions over time by sticking to coal and oil. I guess that's where his kickbacks are. China is investing over $300 billion in alternative energy and creating 15 million jobs. Meanwhile in the US, we saved a few coal jobs.
8753 2018-01-23 04:52:43 Don't give anything that can't be taken back if conditions are not met. We seen this before from lying politicians.
8754 2018-01-23 04:52:36 Charm!!! Omg he is a friggen snake oil salesman. Nothing out of his mouth is true. Other countries know this.
8755 2018-01-23 04:52:33 is coconut oil good or not wth are y’all talking about

8757 2018-01-23 04:52:07 'Mexico will pay for the wall' reminds me a lot of 'the oil will pay for the Iraq war'
8758 2018-01-23 04:52:00 Another gift to the fossil fuel industry from Trump. Russia has a lot of oil.  Could this gift also be for Putin?! I hope there’s a way to block these tariffs
8759 2018-01-23 04:51:49 Oh sweet, a whole chapter in this National Geographic college-level ESL textbook is titled "Oil as an Important World Resource" and it NEVER ONCE mentions "pollution" or "climate change." 

What garbage. (ESL textbooks are full of this crap.)
8760 2018-01-23 04:51:29 > vitamin E, protein, and other nutrients.
Oil makes his face to shine, for we now know that there are essential fatty acids, which are necessary components of a healthy diet.
Wine makes his heart glad, which is the relaxation created by moderate alcohol consumption.
8761 2018-01-23 04:51:12 No, this is a totally no oil dough. And there isn’t one but many versions of this recipe, and none add oil. 
And I HATE this piece of shit dough. And I’m just going to lock it in the garage and ignore it because otherwise I’m going to toss it in the garbage (spitting on it first)
8762 2018-01-23 04:51:07 Our prices closely track the crude oil price, we pass on reductions as quickly as we can, and shield our customers from dramatic price increases. 2/3
8763 2018-01-23 04:51:02 @srirambjp GM .There are these INC guys who keep using this Oil Prices International vs Local Prices and keep using that as a point of downgrading the govt.Let put up a chart metro wise with a eloborate breakup to set the record straight.I had it earlier but unable to retreive.
8764 2018-01-23 04:50:40 President Trumps administration is slapping tariffs on all aspects of solar energy. Now it is not a request but a demand to see Trumps tax returns, we need to know if the president is taxing industries he has no financial interest in, for oil and gas industries that he does.
8765 2018-01-23 04:50:39 It’s just simplistic and demeaning to women to be written about - oh good job ! Now try writing about normal stuff not just gender
8766 2018-01-23 04:50:27 Always been on side of illegals ever since I can remember. Self serving, double dealing,  dishonest lying serpent.
8767 2018-01-23 04:50:14 Haha  ! Love it !
8768 2018-01-23 04:50:01 Just remembered about how a hot piece of onion popped under my eye cuz of the hot oil on the pan this morning at the uc when the man made me an omlette .... it hurt
8769 2018-01-23 04:49:54 most veggies can do well on medium-high for about 5 minutes, but if you wanna throw in broccoli, boil them for a minute and then blanch them (or steam in the pan with a teeny bit of oil and water for a minute or two) and then chuck ‘em in when the other veggies are nearly done!
8770 2018-01-23 04:49:50 he's just doin what the coal and oil donors expected 4 their donations to his camaign
8771 2018-01-23 04:49:48 People is fed up with U.S. U.S. only wants Haiti's oil.they DON'T care Haitians life.
8772 2018-01-23 04:49:34 Not raw but I use baby oil to remove excess make up and then cleanse with my regular face wash !
8773 2018-01-23 04:49:32 today in oklahoma an oil rig caught on fire and 5 men that were on the floor are still being searched for. 
tomorrow morning my dad leaves out for his rig in texas for 2 weeks. many prayers would be appreciated because with a job like that, you never know if they’ll make it home
8774 2018-01-23 04:49:30 I’m ready for liquid coconut oil weather
8775 2018-01-23 04:49:28 It's not that simple the US also needs to export to get resources like oil, platinum, uranium, steel etc...how will pay for that if countries don't trade with you
8776 2018-01-23 04:49:20 As a solar company, we are devastated to learn Trump has imposed a 30% tariff on solar panels virtually killing the solar industry. Solar employs more people than coal and oil combined. today's decision will cause the loss of roughly 23,000 American jobs this year.
8777 2018-01-23 04:49:19 Best to start with Mena airport scandal; action causes reaction, Twin Towers massacre, Food for oil scandal, Taliban opium ban pharmaceutical special interests, drug and child exploitation trade lane to Turkish heroin factories. Syria chemical weapons?

8779 2018-01-23 04:49:01 Commodities are set for a super duper bull run. While I flagged this in February 2016, when Oil was around 30, now I see a massive upcycle ahead even from here,  for Industrial and Energy Commodities. Fasten seatbelts.
8780 2018-01-23 04:48:38 This is terrible.I know of many people employed by/started with nothing to create very successful solar businesses.Why would a US President do this to our country?China is a big solar producer & so Trump wants to restrict US? Makes no sense at all.Anything to do with Rosneft oil?
8781 2018-01-23 04:48:36 Abortion isn't healthcare, freedom of religion isn't removing separation of church & state, school choice is important, we need oil...yes such a good guy!
8782 2018-01-23 04:48:24 Are oil, mining, coal, or forestry viable, economically sustainable, and work in concert with the environment? It’s a serious question because I’m trying to understand whether @BCGreens support these industries. My impression is opposition to all of the above.
8783 2018-01-23 04:48:02 No one is buying your snake oil
8784 2018-01-23 04:47:44 i accidentally poured too much essential oil into my diffuser and currently my entire room AND the hall smells of tea tree oil even though my door is closed
8785 2018-01-23 04:47:25 Also fyi pick up an essential oil diffuser or charcoal filter bag for the house.
8786 2018-01-23 04:47:14 seems counteractive to keep jailing our most experienced cannabis oil producers rather than bringing them in as consultants and benefiting from all that knowledge and experience
8787 2018-01-23 04:47:12 But one can say I became an adult a few months ago when I went to the dentist, started seeing a therapist, went on a diet, took vitamins and fish oil, paid off my car and started thinking about my future. Word is I might even be dating soon. It's never too late.
8788 2018-01-23 04:47:06 Definitely, but this dough called for no oil at all. Just flour, yeast, salt and water.

I tell ya… this isn’t working for me.
8789 2018-01-23 04:47:06 عذرا اخي العزيز. والله ما قصدت تجاهل احد. ربما لم اتنبه لسؤالك. هل ممكن إعادته، وعذرا مرك اخرى
8790 2018-01-23 04:47:06 Does coconut oil really moisturize y’all skin. Shit doesn’t work for me at all.
8791 2018-01-23 04:46:58 Thanks for the update buddy, how’s the new grips?
8792 2018-01-23 04:46:54 neem oil?
8793 2018-01-23 04:46:50 Like I did the goodnight blend last night and woke up on the other side of the bed with pillows on top of me and had no idea where I even was. Like that’s some good shit right there 10/10 would recommend essential oil diffuser
8794 2018-01-23 04:46:50 THESES COUNTRIES With Massive Wealth OIL Diamonds Silver GOLD , OUR Telling THERE PEOPLE GO.
8795 2018-01-23 04:46:42 Apparently I need to specify that your acting career has been over for a long time. Your career in pseudoscience and snake oil sales fits right in with trump and his uneducated base. So yeah, your career as a charlatan will be fine. Probably will actually grow.
8796 2018-01-23 04:46:38 My brother-in-law is one of the like the big people for this oil rig company that oversees the one that exploded in Oklahoma today and he’s on his way there. God bless all the injured and those that are missing, I’m praying so hard for you. 
8797 2018-01-23 04:46:32 His feelings for Adam were an oil spill; he'd let the overflow and there wasn't a damn place in the ocean that wouldn't catch fire if he dropped a match.
8798 2018-01-23 04:46:29 Yes, but i doubt the families of all the workers still missing after the explosion on an oil rig today would agree that getting rid of safety regulation for workers is a good thing.
8799 2018-01-23 04:46:20 なべちよくん　２さい
8800 2018-01-23 04:46:16 Not those, but we used to make the ones that are made from peanut butter, coconut oil, and cocoa powder. Then we'd put them in a mini muffin pan in a freezer to harden them up.
8801 2018-01-23 04:46:06 Same as not throwing down some gun laws after horrific shootings. #NRA in his dirty little pockets.
The #ExxonKnew oil co. Knows what up.
8802 2018-01-23 04:45:38 This is a conflict of interest that has cost American lives and violates the United States Constitution. January 22, 2018, 9am oil rig in Oklahoma blows up 5 missing. Donald Trump is putting oil workers life's at risk to make more money when more accidents happen.
8803 2018-01-23 04:45:37 Some are both - lovaza (prescription fish oil) and OTC fish oil.
8804 2018-01-23 04:45:25 someone threw used oil blotting paper in my rubbish bin, disgusting.
8805 2018-01-23 04:45:21 It's been a quite a while since I've made bread (pizza and calzone crust actually)--you're far more experienced&  knowledgeable, but I think I remember when there was more oil it made it less sticky. I'd coat it in olive oil and set it aside to rise and it would easier to handle.
8806 2018-01-23 04:45:03 About to buy a massive amount oil paint and canvases tomorrow. Time to get back to my passion. 
8807 2018-01-23 04:44:55 I'll call @ElonMusk or @ford for an electric.  You're brainwashed into our reliance on foreign oil.  We produce more than enough, and what exactly do you think every war since Vietnam has been about?  You're unable to see the macro-economic picture; please don't reply to me.

8809 2018-01-23 04:44:47 One mystery of medicinal marijuana that I never understood is that why people smoke it when using products like marijuana oil is much better for your health than smoking it.
8810 2018-01-23 04:44:47 you know that vine where the girl pours canola oil on the floor and her sister comes running in all excited to get her juice and then slips and shatters the fucking oven and all you hear is “SHIT!” and sobbing at the end? That’s what college has felt like for me

8812 2018-01-23 04:44:40 My friends in high school called me Olive Oil because I’m Extra Virgin
8813 2018-01-23 04:44:20 the reason your skin feels so nice after using coconut oil is because you have remnants of oil sitting on top of it

8816 2018-01-23 04:43:49 If anyone was wondering I’m in love with my essential oil diffuser, I have a bunch of cute blends that have been helping me with my life
8817 2018-01-23 04:43:39 I always smell like coconut oil and vanilla or sum thing
8818 2018-01-23 04:43:38 Trump's 30% tariff on solar panels from overseas, makes it less affordable for those wanting clean energy. I wonder if it benefits his buddies in dirty oil and coal keep the dollars coming in
8819 2018-01-23 04:43:35 Not true-use oil profits for services
Delusional

ทำไมทุกประเด็นไม่ใช่หมดรักแต่เพราะเงินล้วนๆ 
เอ็งทำงานในวงการมากี่ปี ไม่มีเงินบ้างรึถึงทำตัวแบบจับคนรวยเพราะเงิน
8821 2018-01-23 04:43:13 Trump administration removed oil industry safety regulations and enforcement of remaining regulations which has increased the number of accidents that require Halliburton's Boots & Coots to be called making Donald Trump more money.
8822 2018-01-23 04:43:11 Check your Transmission oil this morning.
8823 2018-01-23 04:42:49 Let the healing oil of God flow from the top of your head to the sole of your feet..  Be made whole! In the name of Jesus!!
8824 2018-01-23 04:42:40 So short sighted. We will move renewable whether oil wants it or not. If doesn’t get it together, the fall of this empire will be catastrophic. Who wants a country like China to be the next  power? They r making serious foreign policy moves while  sleeps
8825 2018-01-23 04:42:31 Tea tree oil is my solution for everything now - skin and even non skin related issues 
8826 2018-01-23 04:41:31 Trump has taken action to penalize solar power & jeopardize 269k jobs so he can pay off his cronies in Big Oil
8827 2018-01-23 04:41:30 me: *can barely afford an oil change*
me: yeah, ill drive to Florida.
8828 2018-01-23 04:41:24 our economy runs on oil
8829 2018-01-23 04:41:24 Mix a couple drops of tea tree oil and salt in warm water and gargle it to help ease the pain/soreness in your mouth. Its gross but it works.

8832 2018-01-23 04:40:56 Donald Trump owns stock in Halliburton. Halliburton owns Boots & Coots who is the company that is called when oil and gas drilling rigs catch fire or explode to put the fires out and get well under control if it does not have a safety shut off valve installed.
8833 2018-01-23 04:40:55 Indian forces has fired 9000 mortar shells with high accuracy on Pakistani side. Destroyed Pakistani shelling positions, oil tanks, bunkers & ammo storage! Yesterday 5-6 Pak rangers were killed.

8837 2018-01-23 04:40:23 There is a projection that Uganda's economy will double from USD30b in 2017 to USD70b in 2025 with the earnings from oil/gas. This pre-supposes a GDP growth rate of 11.2%pa starting from 2018. Can the pipeline and refinery be completed in 2018?

8842 2018-01-23 04:39:53 And how do you propose countries that don't have oil buy oil? You need foreign trade because everyone at the moment needs oil
8843 2018-01-23 04:39:34 @lgoKaechele burning the midnight oil at the LG City Council Annual Retreat tonight. #dedicatedjounalist
8844 2018-01-23 04:39:18 @blrcitytraffic Huge traffic pileup from Davis Road signal til Lingarajapura oil mill road. Flyover is packed. 

Signal should be open for a long time for vehicles coming Lingarajapura side. 

This is causing a lot of pileup everyday. @AddlCPTraffic
8845 2018-01-23 04:38:55 nah i have acne scars cuz im always picking at my fucking skin lol i mean it made my skin feel reeeeallllyyyy good but for fading scne scars the vitamin e oil did a better job of that than the aloe did
8846 2018-01-23 04:38:53 Kick their ass and take their gas

Kill them and take their oil

Rape their children and salt the earth with depleted uranium dust from attack aircraft, then extract petrochemicals from beneath their ancestral homeland

8847 2018-01-23 04:38:52 i have a brand new tire, oil changed, clean and gassed up car thanks to my father earlier 
8848 2018-01-23 04:38:43 Thanks. I usually push thru it at all costs but I'm willing to break down tonight and take some Ativan but it's the one prescription I forgot to pack. Argh.  DoTerra Serenity essential oil will have to do.
8849 2018-01-23 04:38:30 The oil isn't gonna pack up and leave for Kansas. Tax it til the roads are drivable and the schools are learnable
8850 2018-01-23 04:38:30 True true that’s the brand I’m on RN. I honestly prefer olive oil but this shit pretty straight for now
8851 2018-01-23 04:38:22 Fry in a little oil, stick in a sandwich with ketchup, yum!
8852 2018-01-23 04:38:21 Music Playing & Diffuser with Lavender Oil  Time for bed.
8853 2018-01-23 04:38:08 Most people don't know how to clean and oil the filters correctly or don't do it at all and so the filters never filter properly. Also the cold air intakes are usually anything but. A true cold air intake will have an enclosed filter with lots of heat shielding.
8854 2018-01-23 04:38:05 He’s gotta do something to cook the books and make oil and gas look better so he can open up all our parks and coasts to his buddies in the industry! If you don’t think he’ll get a cut off that, you’re very naive.
8855 2018-01-23 04:37:53 What do you think about the idea of additional fracking capacity coming online and keeping oil from going back to $100bbl?
8856 2018-01-23 04:37:51 Trump gets money from oil industry, that's why he wants to drill everywhere but maralago. Remember Pruitt, Zinke, and national monuments? Trump doesn't care about environment. Trump cares about money, his money, money he gets from others, it appears.
8857 2018-01-23 04:37:45 Beard guyz beard balm 25. I've used some beard oil as well, but it makes my curly beard too bushy/wild

8859 2018-01-23 04:37:19 Today I ordered groceries online...best thing ever! I also meal prepped in coconut oil  ....and didn’t use salt...! I’m proving to myself I can do this again! #Lifestyle #goals
8860 2018-01-23 04:37:06 Our constantly changing oil tax structure is a big driving force in the operators reluctance to invest in Alaska. Please keep that in mind.
8861 2018-01-23 04:37:06 i really thouvht the oil. i cant do this anymlroe
8862 2018-01-23 04:36:51 Peppermint essential oil is everything
8863 2018-01-23 04:36:47 can i just be the oil guy
8864 2018-01-23 04:36:38 Add oilbelieve yourself
8865 2018-01-23 04:36:37 I put on almond oil and shea butter after my shower. I'm about to be soft as shit in the morning.
8866 2018-01-23 04:36:35 BTW, the “graveyard” referred to in the article is actually the sod graveyard. Pieces of sod taken from the football fields we win on.
8867 2018-01-23 04:36:33 He’s all about bringing back “clean coal” jobs.

Oh, and paying back his Big Oil donors — don’t forget that.
8868 2018-01-23 04:36:29 my oil diffuser has made my nights 80 percent better 
8869 2018-01-23 04:36:20 “put on some lavender *talking about my essential oil flavor* and go to sleep bestie i love you” honestly madi is pure gold i don’t deserve her
8870 2018-01-23 04:36:18 Trump and his friends have their money in oil so solar power is the competition.
8871 2018-01-23 04:36:14 My hunch is that Oil refining and marketing companies should head lower cos of high crude prices. Of course this quarter the profit from inventory will carry the day. Your view?
8872 2018-01-23 04:36:06 A CNN poll is as reliable as a 1984 Ford Aerostar with no oil in the engine.
8873 2018-01-23 04:35:56 your oil painting sucks
8874 2018-01-23 04:35:50 Coconut oil is my whole life 
8875 2018-01-23 04:35:49 I’m was gonna be so upset because I don’t have makeup removers buttttt I have coconut oil 
8876 2018-01-23 04:35:46 日本円が下がって台湾ドルが4年前ぐらいから上がってるからだと思いますよ☺︎
8877 2018-01-23 04:35:42 It could be true. Idk tbh. But yeah it's true that she did push Mexico to privatize oil and continue the drug war. Mexico has always been the U.S.'s lap dog, so Mexico is probably taking directions from the U.S. on this respect.
8878 2018-01-23 04:35:42 Pound 100 beers? Oil slide? Get Gold Cock Army tattoo?

8880 2018-01-23 04:35:32 Some Monday Makeup Motivation....can we start 2018 off by not over-lining lips, ladies? It's noticeable. A lil lip scrub and peppermint oil will plump them just enough.
8881 2018-01-23 04:35:29 They're defending the oil industry. And they also see the long game, electric vehicle development aids renewables since both benefit from battery improvements and mass production.
8882 2018-01-23 04:35:23 Is Tea Tree oil good ? Idkkkk my face hasn’t been this bad since 9th grade 
8883 2018-01-23 04:35:22 Clay Mask with added Frankincense Essential Oil and ACV. So relaxing.
8884 2018-01-23 04:35:21 I need to do an oil change on my car and my motorcycle this is when I wish I had a garage in my house 
8885 2018-01-23 04:35:13 My birthday coming up, just in case y’all wanna know what I want; sunflowers, an oil diffuser, canvases and paint supplies, am all expense paid weekend at a hotel, mani/pedi, a blender, waffle maker, cassata cake, chocolate covered strawberries, wine (white/blush)
8886 2018-01-23 04:35:12 Its Russia that want's us and the rest of the world too use only gas and oil. That's Putin's plan. It's all they have. They are so far behind in alternative power sources "solar & wind" they need the world to consume more gas & oil.
8887 2018-01-23 04:34:52 yaaaassss. i put some adobo on it. put them in veggie oil. and then tossed them in buffalo sauce!!
8888 2018-01-23 04:34:50 Y'all give him too much credit. I give Wendell about a 8 at the most. While he was good, as a foil at times; he was not a match in the end for JR OR for the Ewings and Ewing Oil. #Dallas40
8889 2018-01-23 04:34:45 LIKE TBE OIL
8890 2018-01-23 04:34:41 I just tried the 100% Cold-pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil from The Ordinary (@Sephora) and my skin has never been softer. Highly recommend for winter skin!
8891 2018-01-23 04:34:39 That Sweet (!) Almond oil - best to buy in bulk and use without reservation!
8892 2018-01-23 04:34:32 Oil is what allows us to have the standard of living we have. Feel free to buy an electric car that only gets 80-100 miles a charge and is expensive to maintain. If everyone drove an electric car we'd actually be polluting more by burning coal to generate all that electricity.
8893 2018-01-23 04:34:26 OIL DIFF: 5.44 -> 5.46
8894 2018-01-23 04:34:26 What’s a good raw oil to remove makeup with? I don’t like using coconut oil.
8895 2018-01-23 04:34:19 Try rubbing peppermint oil on your temples.
8896 2018-01-23 04:34:14 make sure your liver’s all good, take probiotics, get fish oil in you, consider magnesium pills at night, keep Vitamin C levels good. You’ll be right 
8897 2018-01-23 04:34:05 literally any vegetable lifehack is just "toss in balsamic vinegar, olive oil, and minced garlic, oven-roast until browning"
8898 2018-01-23 04:34:04 もう一回くらいは2100乗りたいね
8899 2018-01-23 04:33:57 His filthy rich cronies want to slow down the industry until they can get their money out of oil and coal so they can set themselves up to hog the profits from solar.
8900 2018-01-23 04:33:48 Palmers coconut oil lotion is >>>>
8901 2018-01-23 04:33:35 How about the Atlantic, we don't want oil drilling either. Stop it all together!
8902 2018-01-23 04:33:35 Look what up exactly? I know those countries can produce more cheaply. If we didn’t mind rampant oil spills, unregulated pipeline safety, no WCB or safety regulations for our workers we could do that too. But we aren’t that kind of society, are we?
8903 2018-01-23 04:33:33 The greatest responsibility you are given in the oil and gas business is to stop unsafe operations. Regardless of experience you are obligated to take action.
8904 2018-01-23 04:33:27 What kind of oil do you use?
8905 2018-01-23 04:33:08 Currently soaking my hair in coconut oil in preperation for wednesday 
8906 2018-01-23 04:33:04 Putin wants the price of oil to go up. So does the Koch Brothers. So yeah... 
8907 2018-01-23 04:33:02 Lord I need a new skincare routine . Coconut oil broke my face out . Witch hazel BROKE MY FACE OUT . Now it’s just dry and itchy wtddlssks HELPPPP
8908 2018-01-23 04:32:57 be careful with tea tree oil! It can cause irritation and pigment issues especially with darker skin types.
8909 2018-01-23 04:32:44 Shorter: Imagine your auto insurance premiums if it covered oil changes and tune-ups.

And wiper blades.
8910 2018-01-23 04:32:31 They need coconut oil for their face and water for your mouth because YOU WILL PASS OUT
8911 2018-01-23 04:32:24 Do u even love yourself if you don't put oil on your body AFtER showering?
8912 2018-01-23 04:32:14 Obama GDP was poor for 8 years. Barely over 1%. He over regulated and refused to be oil independent. His Obamacare hurt business and cost excess of billions just in blunders. Trillions added to debt. Couldn't write a budget. If it were him you'd of seen improvement 4-5 years ago.
8913 2018-01-23 04:32:11 And I’m now embarrassed to be a Nole
8914 2018-01-23 04:32:10 Right like I was about to say I’ve been using coconut oil on my face after I’ve cleansed my face, and I do not get breakouts as often as I used to. 

COCONUT OIL IS OKAY TO GO ON YOUR FACE TOO.
8915 2018-01-23 04:32:01 Donald Trump went to Jiffy Lube?

WOW! I just got my Lambo Oil change there!

I think Donald will be doing his own Digital Rectal Exam first!
8916 2018-01-23 04:32:00 @SuzanneSomers , of  COURSE you love him!  You're another snake oil salesman who sells to mostly naive and uneducated people!
8917 2018-01-23 04:31:49 How many deaths has @realDonaldTrump caused today?

1. 5 missing from oil rig explosion in Oklahoma after #DontheCon rolls back safety regulations

2. Man threatens to kill all CNN employees because @POTUS says they're "fake news."
8918 2018-01-23 04:31:49 Oh yeah I got approved for PTO for katsu so katsu is 10000000% I’m going to get an oil change for the drive
8919 2018-01-23 04:31:46 skksdkld im tired but I actually love coconut oil so when I found out it clogged pores a while back I was so sad rip

8924 2018-01-23 04:30:22 Try a clay mask as well. You don’t look like you get crazy breakouts so idk if the peel masks will make too much of a diff, but a clay mask helps draws out excess oil & sebum (if u experience oily skin)

8927 2018-01-23 04:29:52 @SenFeinstein Can we legally impeach Trump for crimes against humanity? Oil drilling on our coasts, tariffs on solar panels to depress solar use, breaking up families, no Paris Accord, etc. He’s like a plague that’s trying to suffocate the Earth & it’s inhabitants.
8928 2018-01-23 04:29:51 Islamic terrorists and ISIS supported by Erdogan. Your journalists uncovered the Erdogan family oil deals with ISIS. It was a few years ago and they are now all in jail.
8929 2018-01-23 04:29:44 I am in the same place as you oil kicked my ass
8930 2018-01-23 04:29:32 Trump has just imposed a 30% tariff on solar materials. He is invested in the oil & has business & wants to kill our environment for his gain! Can no one stop this man? We need to be requiring solar on all new construction, NOT THIS!!
8931 2018-01-23 04:29:29 Coconut oil is my best friend. 
8932 2018-01-23 04:29:10 Why do people call you a snake oil salesman?
8933 2018-01-23 04:28:30 @Realdonaldtrump So with the stroke of ur pen today, u destroyed 23,000 jobs in the solar industry!!! You are not the president of the United States; you are the shill for big oil & energy!

8936 2018-01-23 04:28:18 Well he's owned by gas and oil people, why would he want to support solar?  He'd want to shut solar down.  Sucks for everyone, but it will get turned around, hopefully soon!
8937 2018-01-23 04:28:09 I get liquid hand soap that has Maraula oil in it.
8938 2018-01-23 04:28:06 The oil execs are so proud of their big boy, Donny John Trump!

タオルで濡髪の水気を取ったらあんず油でコート。温風で髪根元から、前髪→後頭部→真ん中→サイドの順で乾かし（同じ部分にあてず10cm以上離！）少し引張るように乾かすとクセが出にくいそう。毛先を軽い温風→最後は必ず冷風で上から下に向けるのもポイント #あんず油
8940 2018-01-23 04:27:48 I feel like such an old lady. The last few nights to prepare for bed I’ve taken my medication, sprayed my pillow with “sleep” spray, turned on my diffuser with my sleep aid oil and heated up my heating pad.

8943 2018-01-23 04:27:23 Thank YOU so much! We want to go back to the roots of good eating! Fresh herbs and some olive oil
8944 2018-01-23 04:26:49 Steve said that the oil from the marula nut makes good lip balm. Commercially it is used in shampoo & cosmetics. #safariLIVE
8945 2018-01-23 04:26:45 I love baby oil 
8946 2018-01-23 04:26:28 Loves money, not oil, nearly as much as he loves himself and that number is way off the charts.
8947 2018-01-23 04:26:21 Oil and gas are hideously dangerous and damaging businesses. Seeing things like that emphasizes all the more why renewable energy needs to happen.
8948 2018-01-23 04:26:20 You may be right Randy, hopefully even they will come to a point where they realise that he's not up to it, his promises are only to further his own megalomania, he's a snake oil salesman and worse of all they've all been duped...God help'em if they don't..
8949 2018-01-23 04:26:11 Oil cleanser tu mmg best gila.
8950 2018-01-23 04:26:11 Some pharmacy & natural stuff shops.
I used to take the pills but it wasn’t enough when I was preggers, the oil works quicker & better for me plus don’t have to choke down a giant pill!
8951 2018-01-23 04:25:47 And I quit after I had a rig almost blow up on me- puddles of crude oil on the ground and a frantic phone call from a geologist several states away, to confirm we were still all okay.
8952 2018-01-23 04:25:45 I'm not Vinnie but that is a rockstar Olive Oil
8953 2018-01-23 04:25:35 God told me you are a snake oil salesman.
8954 2018-01-23 04:25:18 Humanities gone smoked up in a gravity bong by a democrat republican Cheech and Chong.  When it comes to oil and gas Dems might play it like they are against big oil and reps make it clear that they are for it. In the end they on the same side on this
8955 2018-01-23 04:25:11 Soliciting for your quick input @Opiaiya on how the Youth can benefit from opportunities presented by the Oil & Gas sector in Uganda.
8956 2018-01-23 04:25:11 @realDonaldTrump Your greed is only surpassed by your willingness to damage the Earth and it’s inhabitants. You want to destroy our beaches with oil rigs known to spill, and now curtail the use of solar by putting a tariff on the panels coming into US. We will overcome! Coward!
8957 2018-01-23 04:24:55 coconut oil :-)
8958 2018-01-23 04:24:49 Trudeau should be pushing investment opportunities at trade missions and not social policies. Want to build a refinery to get oil to market, look to Canada. Factory to build parts to ship to the US, look to Canada and the list goes on. Instead we have a man child ruining things
8959 2018-01-23 04:24:45 Gucci belt or oil change ?
8960 2018-01-23 04:24:42 What annoys me: I ordered Duke’s mayonnaise off of amazon and it came floating in the jar in its oil. Looks like...well, I can’t say, but Dave wouldn’t be happy.
8961 2018-01-23 04:24:37 How many people trade the Futures of wheat, rice, corn, oil, gold etc. that end up being physically delivered and transact (by your rational)? I think the last report I read was <5% of Futures actually ever get delivered -- sound familiar to other markets?
8962 2018-01-23 04:24:33 Holy shit seeing an oil rig explosion in Oklahoma. That was legit my biggest fear when I was out there.
8963 2018-01-23 04:24:14 I do prefer olive oil tho simply cuz it don’t smell as strong
8964 2018-01-23 04:24:11 #SafariLive what is the Murula oil good for?
8965 2018-01-23 04:24:09 Love to be a slave and massage your thighs with oil while you destroyed my face between them! :)
8966 2018-01-23 04:23:54 Air pam mati. Cleansing oil abis. Mo cumuk nda bisa. Padahal daki muka udah tebel bgt kayak martabak nutella pecenongan. Huhu
8967 2018-01-23 04:23:54 I'm talking about preventing 1-7 billion people from dying in a global hyperinflationary event when all supply chains break down. I am talking about ending our slavery to war and oil. What spiritual battle do you have that is bigger than that?
8968 2018-01-23 04:23:43 It would be news if he didn't hold onto the shares in the gun company.  This guy probably has toy oil derricks on his desk.
8969 2018-01-23 04:23:31 Pakai baby oil! Wkwkwk. Rambutku dulu dikasih hairspray juga ga mempan :( bentar dah balik.

Jadi dulu dikasih baby oil baru dicatok curly gitu '-' mayan sih~

Paid for by  wealthy oil rich Saudi's and Muslims world wide donating to the agenda .
8975 2018-01-23 04:22:12 Is gifted bottle of moisturising face oil.
Uses skeptically.
Really, REALLY likes it.
Looks up said oil online.
Chokes on $125 price tag.
Resigns self to being scaly wrinkled lizard person all winter.
8976 2018-01-23 04:22:07 The solution is easy. Tax out of state companies 25% for our oil. Remove the tax for OK headquartered companies. And watch jobs (and government revenue) in Oklahoma grow...
8977 2018-01-23 04:22:05 I like how the Gulf is just a giant, inky-black oil spill.
8978 2018-01-23 04:21:53 Tom Izzo...You are a great coach !!!  Way to win by 13....Go Team Go !!
8979 2018-01-23 04:21:31 And when he arrived in the UK it was to hefty tax hike there too, lol. His move was more to do with his nasty divorce. He also supported “greener” initiatives related to oil sands.
8980 2018-01-23 04:21:29 That tiny bit of info about solar employing more than coal and oil, an example of how Trump is uninformed on things like that. His people don’t know what kinds of info to be looking for. For a business guy he doesn’t understand business very well. His working knowledge is so low.

8983 2018-01-23 04:20:41 I use oil! Wax is wayyyy to strong for me.
8984 2018-01-23 04:20:40 @RidlrMUM an oil tanker is stalled under sion flyover at the signal opposite petrol pump. Traffic towards sion is affected.
8985 2018-01-23 04:20:38 The world's largest oil company, Saudi Aramco, generates over $1 billion in revenue every day.
8986 2018-01-23 04:20:04 If you had told 14-year-old me that one day I’d be PUTTING oil in my hair and on my face as part of my beauty routine I would have told you to gtfo
8987 2018-01-23 04:20:04 Honestly coconut oil made my hair grow strong and moisturized
8988 2018-01-23 04:20:03 But she’s in QVC every week selling snake oil.
8989 2018-01-23 04:19:55 Why does Trump want the USA to fail?  Vladimir Putin. He’s an oil guy.

8991 2018-01-23 04:19:49 yes girl you put it on clean hair so it pre absorbs the oil  doesn’t work on already oily hair!
8992 2018-01-23 04:19:37 昨日研究室に泊まっちゃえば良かったな
8993 2018-01-23 04:19:34 when you get a service done (hair, nails, makeup, dining out, massage, tattoos, oil change etc.) MAKE SURE YOU FUCKING TIP.

8995 2018-01-23 04:19:31 Oil paint is made by my mom and the other is made by me
8996 2018-01-23 04:19:24 In that order?
Is the oil a pre poo or as needed?
You don’t follow the cinder vinegar rinse w anything? Even for smell?
8997 2018-01-23 04:19:22 石油だってオリーブオイルだって牛脂だって仲間さ、そうだろう?
8998 2018-01-23 04:19:22 Do oil and gas association in #txlege or other groups have rubrics?  Why or why not?
8999 2018-01-23 04:19:20 Now if not we could get our oil and gas there!
9000 2018-01-23 04:19:18 I was referring to low cost oil production countries. Corrupt gov’ts, no environmental regulations, no human rights - of course they can produce it cheaper than Canada. QC imports tanker loads up the St Lawrence happily enough.

9003 2018-01-23 04:19:01 Correct. The government debt is the inverse of private sector savings. One could look at that as an asset, as most of us Keynesians do. The problem with neo liberals/classicists like Kate is their history begins in the 70s, with the oil shocks

9008 2018-01-23 04:18:13 spot treatment of vitamin E oil! not too much bc it is an oil, but it does help with scarring. also the SS serum from @BahiCosmetics and gardens galore I think it’s called help a lot from what I’ve heard

9012 2018-01-23 04:17:03 And I’m too stuck on Coconut Oil to even try other products but I said I was gone start trying other products.
9013 2018-01-23 04:16:58 Skin care threads on here be going so well until they start adding coconut oil as a moisturizer
9014 2018-01-23 04:16:55 พยายามหาเรื่องอื่นมาลบล้าง พยายามทำตัวสนุกให้ลืมเรื่องเครียด มันก็ช่วยได้ส่วนนึง แต่พอมาเจอซ้ำๆมันก็เค่ียดเหมือนเดิม ...

9018 2018-01-23 04:16:19 And much of Israel's water comes from Syrian-owned Golan Heights! Now teamed up with Murdoch, Rothschild, Cheney, et. al., they now stealing oil from the Golan.  It's sad, it's sick and as wrong as wrong can possibly be!
9019 2018-01-23 04:16:17 Koch's, Putin, Tillerson & Exxon are all about oil. Plus his LNG pals. He hates America & Americans. His agenda does not include any of us. Hang in there. 60% of us are with you. Gotta get the traitors out first.
9020 2018-01-23 04:16:04 Oil and dirt go good on taquitos.
9021 2018-01-23 04:16:01 Makes perfect sense, since the fastest growing US occupation is Solar Installer. 
Projected growth rate of 105%!
@realDonaldTrump hurting families across the country, holding on to coal and oil. 
Taking us back to the 1950's!
9022 2018-01-23 04:15:54 My son in law works the oil field and it worries the crap out of me .. There was an explosion here in Oklahoma today, 5 men missing, well on fire .. I totally support you sir and can’t believe what this admin is doing to the solar sector

9024 2018-01-23 04:15:41 The previous few decades would've been the time to do it, won't happen now. Their medium-to-long term economic/fiscal outlook is very bleak w/ the oil price drop (partly thanks to shale boom), let alone their internal and geopolitical problems
9025 2018-01-23 04:15:39 you're not cool until you've power washed synthetic oil off of your shoes with 2500 pounds per square inch of pressure

9034 2018-01-23 04:14:36 Just imagine , we are not producing this so called oil
9035 2018-01-23 04:14:32 So one ship getting stuck in the ice disproves all of the science behind Anthropogenic Global Warming.

You are a piece of work. Say, are you being paid by Russia to advance their interests in drilling for oil in a melting Arctic?

9042 2018-01-23 04:13:36 Don’t need more silica in the oil for a non-measurable performance increase.  Did a UOA on my Forester years ago using a stock vs. K&N filter.  Had a lot more silica in the oil with the K&N.
9043 2018-01-23 04:13:34 She sells vitamins and tonics and snake oil a la Infowars, right? Must be something in the organic protein powder supplements...
9044 2018-01-23 04:13:33 Just pay off to big oil!!

we've been trying to mix it up
9049 2018-01-23 04:12:45 I thought we buried the food vs fuel debate years ago when we were only dealing with corn. Now activists and oil shills want to argue about cellulosic feed stocks? Lol
9050 2018-01-23 04:12:42 My uncle works at the oil rig and their been so many explosions, it makes me so scared when he goes back to work 
9051 2018-01-23 04:12:27 Oil
9052 2018-01-23 04:12:07 You could also argue that the raw materials are better to mine from other countries to preserve local natural resource. Same reason to store US oil and drill less and import more when foreign prices are low.
9053 2018-01-23 04:11:43 wait 2 days i remember i had a horrible dark mark where it burned start to form 2 days after i used the mask. if so, just use vitamin e oil and put it on every hour or two and massage it for like 5 minutes thats what helped mine go away.

9062 2018-01-23 04:10:29 This is the reality!!!! USD is toillet paper printed in trillions year after year. Without the need for buying oil or other commodities at the stock it would become useless. The military industrial complex is keeping alive somehow.

9086 2018-01-23 04:07:57 It's his gift to the Kochs and Big Oil barons.. OK & FL passed legislation to dissuade solar panel usage. Combine other anti-environmental laws, i.e. opening deep sea drilling in the Atlantic & Pacific Oceans, will keep US dependent on fossil fuel.

9106 2018-01-23 04:04:46 @RepLynnJenkins Scott Pruitt has got to go! He's putting the profits of the oil/gas industry ahead of the public's health and the health of our environment. We only have the one planet; we can't afford to screw it up with more toxic pollution! #bennettlaks@gmail.com
9107 2018-01-23 04:04:38 A necklace that holds essential oil is 
9108 2018-01-23 04:04:28 OIL DIFF: 5.45 -> 5.47
9109 2018-01-23 04:04:25 I wish I could be the one to rub that oil all over your body. You are so beautiful!
9110 2018-01-23 04:04:24 I been using Vitamin E oil for my face and honesty it’s been doing me soo good!!!
9111 2018-01-23 04:04:22 If anyone wants to buy me something nice I’ll take an oil diffuser. And some essential oils. Get my zen together n shit

El gas oil productivo te suena? Todas las quitas a los préstamos, la condonación de deudas, no es un subsidio? Yo seré nerd, pero vos sos bastante necio.
9114 2018-01-23 04:04:05 This is definitely a job killer. #CadetBoneSpur trying to pay back his oil and gas industry buddies by killing off the competition
9115 2018-01-23 04:04:04 Hey @freshii really annoying you changed the sauce on the Buddha satay bowl to fish oil, it’s not vegan friendly anymore and there’s 0 notice. Had I not said anything I wouldn’t have known. #Notcool

9117 2018-01-23 04:03:42 I’m glad to have a more holistic option for my anxiety than the Lexapro, but I’m still not noticing much of a difference with the weed stuff (cbd tincture, thc mints). Also, I can’t even open my cbd oil by myself. Very frustrating when I’m alone

9120 2018-01-23 04:03:22 I hate that coconut oil is good for my hair but bad for my lashes 
9121 2018-01-23 04:03:20 Yeah I just realized if you don’t have vegetable oil you probably don’t have Apple sauce lol I just really felt for that chocolate cake lol
9122 2018-01-23 04:03:05 Oil colors.
9123 2018-01-23 04:03:05 Wanna get rubbed in oil . My thighs sore asl
9124 2018-01-23 04:02:57 Lavender is my forever favorite essential oil
9125 2018-01-23 04:02:56 It's usually when i have more than one oil on my face that i got to be careful. otherwise i be baby smoove
9126 2018-01-23 04:02:45 I have no choice but to file for bankruptcy. My husband was laid off from an oil company position he had for 17 years. He still cannot get rehired at a decent wage. I have been ill for 17 years. We have no where to turn yet all of these illegal or undocumented folks get it all.
9127 2018-01-23 04:02:43 やだぁ〜〜〜〜〜〜意地でも治したらぁ！！！！
9128 2018-01-23 04:02:32 First off essential oils make my skin nice and they help me breathe. But lavender and eucalyptus help me sleep, orange and lemon give me energy in the mornings. I mix them with almond oil and put them on my face and I'm ready to go. They also make me gloowww. Fenty who?

9132 2018-01-23 04:02:15 ครับผม
9133 2018-01-23 04:01:58 my grandpa just gave me cannabis oil lmaooo what
9134 2018-01-23 04:01:38 on building treatment tanks. unfortunately plastic production requires oil, if we need more plastic, we need more oil...so someone's making money on this...while we're left with non-biodegradable mess.
9135 2018-01-23 04:01:33 There’s is (was) a service station at Houston & LaFayette. Right across from the Puck Bldg. I used to work there, and when I drove in to the city, I’d leave my car for an oil change, $15 at the time. Parking anywhere nearby was much more for all day. So I got oil changes 2x/wk.
9136 2018-01-23 04:01:22 Fortunately for us all, science and industry finds new ways of extracting oil that were unknown just a short time ago. Unfortunately, the global oil resources are finite. Science can find oil, but not create new supplies. Renewable energy sources are the hope for the future.
9137 2018-01-23 04:01:13 Interesting how these gangsters work-they'll get their rate rise =>oil  risen fast (which they pumped up)..banks will be dancing in the streets then crash oil over night & take all the longs money-down the road excuse for QE4 when mid class Joe lunch box defaults..Fed always wins
9138 2018-01-23 04:01:00 Been without coconut oil for about week, i was going crazy !
9139 2018-01-23 04:00:45 That’s what they want you to think, trump want all power to come from oil, coal and nuclear, because that’s where profit is made.
9140 2018-01-23 04:00:45 Nice try bot get an oil change! Everyone cares about porn stars! @realDonaldTrump is a #PussyGrabbingRacistRussianClown thats happening! porn stars Oh Yeah! It makes a difference... #FuckDonaldTrump #BlueWave2018 #TheResistance
9141 2018-01-23 04:00:43 They also always have them at stores like tj maxx / Marshall’s for relatively cheap, and some drugstores carry them! The only impt thing w oils is making sure they’re 100% that oil and not blended w anything else
9142 2018-01-23 04:00:35 WHAT...it can clog pores n cause more acne...i guess it’s ok if ur skin isn’t acne prone but jojoba oil is probably better suited for moisturizing
9143 2018-01-23 04:00:24 domino’s beard makes his chin so huge my god what kind of beard oil is he using
9144 2018-01-23 04:00:15 Good read!
“Lips are unbelievably thin and unlike other areas of the skin, the lips have no oil glands so they tend to dry out easily.”
Wear a lip moisturizer, errbody! 
9145 2018-01-23 03:59:56 “data is the new oil (and steel)”
something to consider in 2018

Feel free to contact me
9146 2018-01-23 03:59:43 No shit!  I worked for a major oil company, safety in name only!
9147 2018-01-23 03:59:36 Sometimes oil is cheaper on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange than it is underneath the ground
9148 2018-01-23 03:59:35 ขี้ไม่ออกอีกแล้ววว แง้
9149 2018-01-23 03:59:26 I think the best skincare advice is to keep it simple. Limit products...no one needs to use African black soap, cetaphil, witch hazel, tea tree oil, oxy pads and rose water everyday. Also limit the masks. Don’t do too much sis!
9150 2018-01-23 03:59:26 All I will say is that I stopped using coconut oil on my wet skin when I got out of the shower and my skin hasn’t been right ever since, so now I’m back on. Have a good day. p.s. I will not put it in my hair unless I’m taking down a style, then I will use a very lite amount.
9151 2018-01-23 03:59:17 Sure there is no correlation between EPA'S Zinke role in Oklahoma and the Fracking earthquakes and current Oil Well fire. Causation ?
9152 2018-01-23 03:59:15 we want oil ministry be 100% transparent on pricing...?
9153 2018-01-23 03:59:12 I want to oil paint so bad but I don’t have my supplies 
9154 2018-01-23 03:59:08 ได้สิจ้า
9155 2018-01-23 03:59:07 Thank you for sharing. We care. Koch’s love it along with oil and gas. So Trump doesn’t care either.
9156 2018-01-23 03:58:48 I woulda put cooking oil on all non-carpet floors
9157 2018-01-23 03:58:33 So let’s elect a game-show host with no gov experience. An oil co executive to run State. Nominate for federal judge two guys who’ve never had a trial. Appoint a 24 yr old to run nat’l drug policy. They don’t want gov to work. That’s their purpose.

9159 2018-01-23 03:57:33 The sooner the #BlueTsunami2018 hits the better off we'll be .. This lunatic is against everything that is good for America .. To kill the solar industry is beyond reprehensible 

It's all about big oil and coal .. money and greed to hell with a clean planet .

One Term mthfker !
9160 2018-01-23 03:57:12 I went to make a chocolate cake bc that's what I do at 10pm and I had everything poured and cracked and measured but we didn't have VEGETABLE OIL SO I DONT GET CAKE AND I WASTED ALL OF IT
9161 2018-01-23 03:57:07 Nothing like this to say you are in the pocket of Big Oil.
9162 2018-01-23 03:56:45 Anybody tell me it have jab now I bringing the oil and chain!
9163 2018-01-23 03:56:36 Sounds like a show I saw earlier when some women’s march later was trying to say that this was Obama’s economy when we all know that markets look forward they do not look to the rear D regulation lower taxes cheaper oil how stupid are these people think we are
9164 2018-01-23 03:56:35 Understood, meanwhile if you have any, try chewing on some coconut oil, may help a little& I'll keep you in my prayers.... Unfortunately I know dental issues well!
9165 2018-01-23 03:56:33 The filthy rich families that run the world see the writing on the wall for oil. They want to squeeze out far-sighted foreign suppliers until they can get themselves set up to hog the profits from solar.
9166 2018-01-23 03:56:31 They didn’t touch any of the onshore oil regulations so people should quit saying it had something to do with that. I’m an oilfield engineer and these things sometimes happens regardless of how hard we work to prevent it. It was likely sparked when they were setting up burn off.
9167 2018-01-23 03:56:29 Not only a conduit...but a very effective "Pipeline".  Oil cos. have nothing on Kushner.  Also, we need to remember his own businesses & refinancing the huge Fifth Ave. Building loan is his #1 priority.   Hopeful this is more fuel for Mueller & team.
9168 2018-01-23 03:56:23 @JerryMoran Scott Pruitt has got to go!  He's been putting the profits of the oil/gas industry above the health of Americans and our environment. We only have the one planet and we can't afford to screw it up. #bennettlaks@gmail.com
9169 2018-01-23 03:56:22 You should buy wax warmers or oil burners. Much better.
9170 2018-01-23 03:56:16 the foundation of the economy is based on war and oil. 
What is your plan to transition from this?
9171 2018-01-23 03:55:47 $OAS looks great here. Just need help from oil.
9172 2018-01-23 03:55:42 The Russian led Eurasian confederacy will come into Israel and the Middle East to take Israel's oil and natural gas and to take a prey! Ezekiel.38,39. Putin plans war! A Christadelphian Bible student.
9173 2018-01-23 03:55:38 Actually this is a reward to the Koch brothers, the gas & oil industry, & Russia. By ignoring climate change action, they're trying to melt the permafrost where oil is found. Remember when he reversed the ban on Artic drilling? Greed is driving the bus. A bunch of sociopaths.
9174 2018-01-23 03:55:37 His job is in jeopardy, b/c he gave permission to drill for oil off the Florida coast without asking Trump first.
WooHoo!

9185 2018-01-23 03:54:06 The only thing I have faith in this semester is the magical abilities of coconut oil and even that faith is starting to wear thin. 
9186 2018-01-23 03:54:05 Stir in ten pinches of olive oil then set timer for 3 minutes.
9187 2018-01-23 03:54:03 I chop them season them then I put them over med on a pan with a bit of olive oil! And stir them till they’re semi soft! Then add the peppers & onions and stir for another 10 min! Then add black beans, & corn! And let them cook for another 10-20

9189 2018-01-23 03:53:44 oiled my scalp with peppermint oil & it feels sensational 
9190 2018-01-23 03:53:37 Trump owes oil and gas giants and solar loses. He pretends its to help consumers and US businesses but it’s a payoff or “please like me” action
9191 2018-01-23 03:53:27 The International Energy Agency (IEA) expects the United States oil output to be higher than that of Saudi Arabia in 2018. This would make US the world's second largest producer after Russia.

9194 2018-01-23 03:53:21 The Democratic - anti-American Party clearly cares more about illegal aliens than American citizens.  All to grow a voter base to keep them in power oil order to fulfill their agenda of Socialism.
9195 2018-01-23 03:53:16 Cooking in the nude os actually tons of fun. Just don’t do anything that involves hot oil
9196 2018-01-23 03:53:15 Koch Bros. commands. They want us using oil & gas. Polluting, using coal.
No solar, no electric cars etc. Billions
9197 2018-01-23 03:52:58 Did a coconut oil/ tea tree oil wash on my hair overnight last night and let me tell you...IT FEELS AMAZING
9198 2018-01-23 03:52:58 Now an $800 million giveaway? Last year our Alaska Senate GOP colleagues blocked a Fair oil tax reform that would have imposed a 25% base profits tax. At today’s oil prices of $67/barrel, that would have raised $800 million towards our $2.5 billion deficit #Reconsider #Akleg

9201 2018-01-23 03:52:15 Also, don’t forget that Russia’s got a major stake in our continuing to burn oil.

9216 2018-01-23 03:49:38 Regulated areas to control encroachment, infra to control hygiene & adulteration, banning oil that's reused forever will help. Money & employment should be environment & people friendly. Fyi, TN govt employs many n sells liquor for 1000s of crores!! Dirty outlets n bad quality.
9217 2018-01-23 03:49:27 Gave my hair a good coconut oil soak, while starting a new painting. Then took a lovely bath, and now enjoying a nice cup of herbal tea. Tis been a good evening. I am thankful. #TheseAreTheThingsIEnjoy
9218 2018-01-23 03:49:11 Why is this an issue ? Global Oil Prices have risen sharply, deregulation of prices mean we’re going to be in tune to market forces

9223 2018-01-23 03:48:50 Oil and politics are what they want you to focus on. One of the root issues is the Fed and Central Banking. Attack and defeat that...you see some real change.

9226 2018-01-23 03:48:26 I’m so glad I did,especially during this time of the year!It’s a really strong “hot oil” so make sure to dilute it with a carrier oil,or your feet get soooo cold
9227 2018-01-23 03:48:24 In a lyft that smells like a stripper. As in a combo of perfume and baby oil. Not sure what I should do.
9228 2018-01-23 03:48:21 One little trick I use to get a sticky dough out of my mixer bowl to rest and hydrate (esp w/pizza dough) is to rub my hands with olive oil. Not wet. Just a few drops rubbed in well. Doesn't seem to affect dough flavor/rise at all.
9229 2018-01-23 03:48:06 doing some deep reading this afternoon and the word "trust" keeps coming up again and again - forget about data being the new oil, trust is

9236 2018-01-23 03:47:12 You forgot more profits for coal, gas and oil industries.

9243 2018-01-23 03:46:16 Going to solar power could reduce America's dependency on oil fired generators, COAL fired............oh!!   always an alternate motivation
9244 2018-01-23 03:46:09 頑張る……何気に火曜と水曜午前と木曜出席日数ピンチな気がするから早いとこ治したいですな
9245 2018-01-23 03:46:09 I have had to come to terms with the fact that I will never receive season tickets for the OKC Thunder from any of OKC's oil and gas companies. I will find a way to carry on.
9246 2018-01-23 03:45:56 たまにはね、
9247 2018-01-23 03:45:53 Got the replacement tire, car's fueled up, plenty of oil, and enough snacks + actual #food. Yep, I'm ready to undersell my #laborpower and face wanton disrespect for the week. #work
9248 2018-01-23 03:45:51 Yep! I mean what is with these people?! Instead of falling for the snake oil salesman’s pitch, they should have gone by his awful record.
9249 2018-01-23 03:45:50 Blood and Oil are great commodities we'll take too
9250 2018-01-23 03:45:06 Also worth mentioning is his interest in Russian oil...
9251 2018-01-23 03:45:01 All they have to do is watch TV. Knew months ago to scrub the worst of the worst texts. How many regular avg Joe criminals get heads up?
9252 2018-01-23 03:44:58 In my case, I used 10 gms of #ghee daily to cook my food (vegan) and my #cholesterol  shot up to over 270 in 3 months. After I switched back to using #sesame oil, 10 gms a day, the cholesterol became normal in 1 month. During that time all other parameters were kept constant.
9253 2018-01-23 03:44:50 Mine aren't hard.  Depends on how much they reduce.  Mine was a lot where they removed nipples trimmed and back on. Most of the scarring is underneath.  Tea tree oil soap helps minimize scars. Not gonna lie it hurts but so worth it
9254 2018-01-23 03:44:37 Really liking this Kiehl’s Midnight Recovery Oil
9255 2018-01-23 03:44:32 Oil prices on the rise! Sabotage in #Oklahoma and a #Iranian oil tanker collided with a Chinese ship. Iranian tanker was carrying over 130 units of oil. # lookitup
9256 2018-01-23 03:44:26 Napalitan najud tawn kog castor oil para sa akng kilay nga gi cancer stage 10
9257 2018-01-23 03:44:20 Yup let’s try to keep the country dependent on oil

9259 2018-01-23 03:43:10 Check your Engine oil this weekend.
9260 2018-01-23 03:43:07 but #Trump wants to end oil drilling regulations. #ScottPruitt & #RyanZinke OK with it.
9261 2018-01-23 03:43:03 You have a point, at least for oil. For gas, I kinda think one would have to curtail fracking and fracking technologies.
9262 2018-01-23 03:42:58 Trump puts a tariff on solar panels and an oil rig explodes in Oklahoma. Hmmm, maybe he caught on renewable energy is the future.
9263 2018-01-23 03:42:35 新しい狂った社会性の誕生なんですよ多分
9264 2018-01-23 03:42:33 It's an oil! And yes! <3
9265 2018-01-23 03:42:02 Flames are slop tonight, if they play like this vs LA and the Oil they are gonna get lit up
9266 2018-01-23 03:41:58 Well that will help make coal king of energy again. Next up:  whale oil.
9267 2018-01-23 03:41:54 We seemed to do fine before our state budget exploded when oil prices were at record highs. Now that oil prices are down nobody in the legislature has the balls to make the tough cuts. Hell, I remember when AK crude was < $10 a barrel and somehow we all survived without a tax. 
9268 2018-01-23 03:41:51 People that use the excuse "correlation is not causation" are the people that dont believe in man made global warming and dont believe that coconut oil is good for your skin therefore, the worst type of people
9269 2018-01-23 03:41:47 The oil field is a small, small world. Heartbreaking. Prayers for the entire oil field family.
9270 2018-01-23 03:41:44 Neil Strauss is a great writer and I’m sure it will be a fascinating look at the inner workings of a mad man and snake oil salesman.

9273 2018-01-23 03:41:23 And Donald Trump approved Keystone and the anti oil, anti prosperity NDP had nothing to do with it.#abpoli #ableg
9274 2018-01-23 03:40:58 Roasted always. I add olive oil and garlic, salt n pepper. Bacon optional.
9275 2018-01-23 03:40:54 Washing machines are a red herring. What Trump really wants to do is clear the decks for the oil and coal companies that helped put him in office. Destroy the alternative energy industry, he and his cronies benefit immensely.
9276 2018-01-23 03:40:54 Shea and cocoa butter baby oil is the best stuff on earth.
9277 2018-01-23 03:40:48 ive been sayin this! it promotes breakouts  use vitamin e oil its so much better for moisturizing
9278 2018-01-23 03:40:47 And I bet oil companies had a big say too some how
9279 2018-01-23 03:40:41 T-shirt - Keep Calm and Carry On meme Ace! Clearly beer isn't pink and fluffy enough for you four to the vegetable oil patch in a cesspit
9280 2018-01-23 03:40:26 You don’t think the domestic oil and coal producers pushed the solar panel issue, do you?
9281 2018-01-23 03:40:24 What do you think is used to build that electric car? What do you think tires are made out of? Where do you think CA's oil comes from? Here's a pro-tip, research how batteries are made and where the materials are mined. That electric car you want? Way worse than oil rigs.
9282 2018-01-23 03:40:16 はいぶりっこちゃんかわええ。長野市では、自分の敷地の雪を車道に投げる人めっちゃ見かける。日が射してるならまだしも、この気温でそれやる？
9283 2018-01-23 03:40:14 Global vehicle production: 'Conventional combustion versus Electric power' 1. ~98% of components, including plastics (oil based), basically used within any modern vehicle.
2. Raw materials required to be mine from the planet, processed, manufactured & transported for assembly.

9286 2018-01-23 03:39:54 Who do you see just drinking oil by its self
9287 2018-01-23 03:39:52 i swear nothing is better than a sweet potato w/ coconut oil
9288 2018-01-23 03:39:43 群れるのが人間の本能ですか
群れると人間訳わからんようになるもんですね
9289 2018-01-23 03:39:39 oil burning that smelled like burnt weed. Needless to say me and my little yoga mat turned right around and slipped out the door. Looks like this was not the place.....
9290 2018-01-23 03:39:34 Question for you, @TylerFlorence: once I’m done with the deep fryer, do I throw away the oil, pour the oil back into its bottle, or just store it in the deep fryer for the next time? I received a deep fryer as a wedding gift and, 16 years later, have yet to use it. #WorstCooks
9291 2018-01-23 03:39:22 If you were tweeting with real New Englanders, you would be gettin a rack of PBR and an Amato's classic italian sandwich....w/oil.
9292 2018-01-23 03:39:17 from wht ive heard cc oil is a sealant and from personal experience cc oil is not for me it worsened my dry patches n just didnt do it. of course everyones diff so stick to wht works for you but maybe try shea and/or vit e oil
9293 2018-01-23 03:39:14 I think as a sign of good faith he should allow drilling for oil in his own backyard.
9294 2018-01-23 03:39:07 I got this super bomb Sleep Well essential oil mix today and am so excited about it.
9295 2018-01-23 03:38:59 Indian Oil Corporation said that the board of directors of the company may consider bonus issue of shares along with its announcement of Q3 results in a meet on 30 January 2018.
9296 2018-01-23 03:38:57 one reason we pay high price was UPA 1and 2 for a decade bought crude fron Iran on loan without paying a penny,money collected from us diappeared and now we pay cash for present and instalment for earlier ,else Iran said no oil, offcource do check on this yourself and update

9299 2018-01-23 03:38:33 Everybody wishes it was a scam, especially the oil industry pushing misinformation.
9300 2018-01-23 03:38:30 そろそろ離脱
9301 2018-01-23 03:38:28 I never have to put coconut oil on my body anymore  my boyfriend oil down my whole body every time we get out the shower 
9302 2018-01-23 03:38:26 yall tea tree oil is the  for your skin at night !!
9303 2018-01-23 03:38:23 Alternative energy sources are not reliable. Fossil fuels will still be required for the foreseeable future. Windmills are a threat to birds and require mass amounts of OIL for lubrication. Solar panels require destructive mining and are a hazard upon disposal.
9304 2018-01-23 03:38:19 I have no idea What that graph means, and I'm pretty smart.  But my concern as a consumer I was quoted $18-20k to convert my home to solar.  54oo-6000 is a big but to add on!  He is doing this at the behest of his coal and oil buddies
9305 2018-01-23 03:38:15 sir over here 1 egg worth 9/-, one egg omelette cost 40 in oil and 45 in butter

9311 2018-01-23 03:37:37 Trump is all about oil. Pipelines, offshore drilling, Russian oil.  He will block any renewable energy so he and his friends can profit.
9312 2018-01-23 03:37:36 What they got out of it was increased sanctions, no oil drilling, much of their covert operations in Western Europe and the US exposed, their oligarchs exposed as money launderers, organized crime figures and Trump property US anchor baby enablers. No wonder the USSR collapsed.
9313 2018-01-23 03:37:25 STOCKS TO WATCH Indian Oil Corporation board to consider bonus issue on Jan. 30.
9314 2018-01-23 03:37:18 this noxzema is so satisfying, it feels like it’s sucking all the oil out my face

9318 2018-01-23 03:36:25 I spent half of my week’s allowance on a liter of foken coconut oil.... guess I’m gonna eat coconut oil this whole week
9319 2018-01-23 03:36:17 Trump is in an ALL OUT WAR against the environment.  From appointing Pruitt to pulling out of the Paris Agreement (abdicating vast opportunities to China), now this 30% tariff.  Have no doubt, Trump is in bed with big oil/Exxon/Tillerson/Putin.
9320 2018-01-23 03:36:10 I just want to know where I apply to rub baby oil & shit on models  let me just rub some booty & go on about my day

9323 2018-01-23 03:36:00 If people think Trump doesn’t have some sort of large investment in oil, than they’re idiots

9331 2018-01-23 03:34:25 絶対動けるうちに、食べ物飲み物、薬などを準備すべきです。検査が目的というより、リレンザかタミフルを早めに処方してもらうために行くべきですね。治りが圧倒的に早くなりますから。注意は病院でインフルエンザをもらう可能性があるのでマスク手洗いうがいを入念に。
9332 2018-01-23 03:34:23 It was terrible, painful lumps and spots. Stopped when I stopped the serum. Swapped to Moroccan oil. X

9336 2018-01-23 03:33:54 I use both of these products and you can actually put a drop or two of maracuja oil into your foundation to give it more of a dewy finish, @tartecosmetics has been a godsend
9337 2018-01-23 03:33:35 A reinvigorating facial mask, earthy green, with sage, jojoba oil, and exfoliating ground almond. It smells musky and sweet.
9338 2018-01-23 03:33:35 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
9339 2018-01-23 03:33:35 Feeling stuck? Try making some art using oil pastels - consider the concept of alternate reality in a map style.
9340 2018-01-23 03:33:35 At what cost? Bib Fortuna drinking green milk is a snake oil attack on traditional gender roles
9341 2018-01-23 03:33:35  Pizza topped with smoked gouda, extra-virgin olive oil, jack cheese, and pineapple.
9342 2018-01-23 03:33:35 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
9343 2018-01-23 03:33:35 everybody knows that when the President complains, a depressed snail has brainfreeze #impeach
9344 2018-01-23 03:33:23  Hop on black castor oil. I can bless you with that one 
9345 2018-01-23 03:33:15 Usually replaced with cheap oils,palm oil etc.

9347 2018-01-23 03:32:55 ... & the Oil Barons continue to oppose expansion of renewables in order to keep fossil fuels profits as high as possible.
9348 2018-01-23 03:32:55 I just burned about 5000 calories laughing about Maddie finding a whole ass perfectly good blueberry bagel under the hood of her car while getting an oil change
9349 2018-01-23 03:32:54 Looking out for the Kochs, oil men.
9350 2018-01-23 03:32:51 what the fuck this shouldn't be like this. the colors are still as dull and all they did was put some oil paint filter
9351 2018-01-23 03:32:51 If you ever have a bad break put mix tea tree oil and coconut oil together . Put it on your zit/ break out over night and wash your face in the morning. Shit works wonders

9362 2018-01-23 03:31:33 hmmm, have you tried coconut oil? it absorbs pretty fast and is thin like you're needing? :O you should be able to buy in the baking section of a grocery store. it has a lot of uses other than cooking c:
9363 2018-01-23 03:31:25 Other than AD In Detroit everyone you mentioned were hired as ambassadors not management /coaches.I think that's the pet peeve with some. Personally, I would've loved It If the Oil brought back his old partner # 22. Having said that if # 7 can rub off on the D/PP...GREAT
9364 2018-01-23 03:31:22 I cannot stand y'all niggas who think being gay is a mental illness...

9365 2018-01-23 03:31:15 Plenty of brands of old have vanished, either due to disputes in the owner org, or inability to keep up with times.

BPL (made excellent TVs in the late 80s, early 90s.)
Postman Oil (Earlier owned by Ahmed Mills, lost to someone else in dispute)
9366 2018-01-23 03:31:06 Yeah I’ve got a witch hazel toner and I don’t see extreme changes but as a natural exfoliater, I use honey & sugar and wet my hands so I won’t scrub harshly. But I have oily skin round my forehead and I get little bumps a lot 2 so I use a few drops tea tree oil in my moisturizer
9367 2018-01-23 03:31:05 helping a friend of mine sharing the following ads:

9368 2018-01-23 03:30:57 Jojoba, lavender, and eucalyptus essential oils came in! The eucalyptus oil was like a bonus so idk which Paladin would fit that smell but I'm debating between Lance and Hunk.

9370 2018-01-23 03:30:39 Some packages at larger garages (DCH, Sime Darby etc.) include basic stuff like oil change, filters etc. unless you specify premium oils. Have to ask.
9371 2018-01-23 03:30:22 It’s funny because everyone that’s saying coconut oil cleared their face up is white or somewhere near .
9372 2018-01-23 03:30:21 For oil cleanser, I use In Her Element first wash (best seller!) in the AM (Php450, Beauty Bar/Beauty MNL) & Biore Oil Cleanser (Php300+, Watsons) at night. I rarely use moisturizer cos I use HumanNature's sunflower oil. When I do, I use HumanNature's Day Moisturizer. 
9373 2018-01-23 03:30:14 @VP Among your qualifications can you add lying hypocrite, Second in Command? You stood in front of troops saying Dems didn’t want to fund them during shutdown. You vulgar liar! It was objected to by McConnell. It’s on Video! We all heard it, you, Snake Oil Charlatan.
9374 2018-01-23 03:30:13 January 22, 2018 at 10:30PM Waiting for #Ecuador to admit Petroecuador oil spills

9384 2018-01-23 03:28:58 Based on a suggestion from his friends in the oil and coal industries?
9385 2018-01-23 03:28:31 The earth is like a car too...got oil and shit and we all run and burn the shit and exhaust it into the air...but holy shit we are fumigating ourselves wtf  climate change  mind blown
9386 2018-01-23 03:28:20 It's not about mindset. I feel like you're making a lot of assumptions about people's positions in life that often vary drastically. Not everyone is shopping in TJ's for truffle oil. Not everyone in TJ's buying truffle oil is even the same...

9388 2018-01-23 03:28:12 o shit that's super affordable. and since it's oil it probably lasts a long time bc you don't need a lot at once.
9389 2018-01-23 03:27:56 I'd reckon the price of any consumables like oil change etc are charged separately, am I right? I'm already due for a regular check now. The gov check is 4 months before June. Hmm
9390 2018-01-23 03:27:54 Ole "Calhoun" here was an oil leaker...Eddie Sachs was not pleased that parnelli didn't get the black flag. Gorgeous car though. Got to love the matching helmet.

9396 2018-01-23 03:27:27 All eyes on Texas, the direction of oil prices this year will be decided here.  U.S. shale is the real life boogeyman.
9397 2018-01-23 03:27:02 I always watch youtube videos, and they always convince me i need to buy all these useful things like i want an essential oil diffuser for my car and room  just so it can smell good
9398 2018-01-23 03:26:58 Old money always wins. don't you dare believe that it was oil that made those shieks so rich. they have more gold then your imagination could possibly dream up. European royalty has always and still kiss their asses. #fuckthebbc
9399 2018-01-23 03:26:55 That’s old news. The Chinese own the Russians. Putin has a 100 year deal with the Chinese on oil leases if he can’t deliver it’s his future so to speak. So, the Chinese is controlling the whole thing.
9400 2018-01-23 03:26:46 Do you exfoliate? If not you should start at least once a week. Apple cider vinegar is a natural toner that reduces little heat bumps and also you can use tea tree oil on a cotton ball. I use a lot of natural things
9401 2018-01-23 03:26:46 Give this one a whirl next time:
1 pinch garlic powder                           1 pinch steak seasoning 
1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil
1/3 cup Worcestershire 
1/3 cup soy sauce

3 tablespoons Dijon mustard
3 cloves garlic chopped

9405 2018-01-23 03:26:29 I am at that point of time in metals and oil idc if we break up or lower i just want to see price discovery that I can make some decent profit off of instead of baby scalps.
9406 2018-01-23 03:26:15 Maybe we Canadians should put a tariff on the oil you get from us. But you made in China Walmart shoppers forget how to shop.
9407 2018-01-23 03:26:08 When I first saw this I thought of how it was going to harm the seller in the street. Then I remembered, Koch brothers +other libertarian billionaires are heavily invested in energy companies not alt energy. Oil and gas wins wins solar has problems. Trump is bought +paid for also
9408 2018-01-23 03:25:49 that is why Trump levied heavy import taxes on solar panels and products.  To protect the money he gets from the oil and coal companies, lining his pockets

9417 2018-01-23 03:24:33 Well I wonder at what point we will go back to coal burning steam powered locomotives? Maybe we can all set around and watch Netflix by the light of our oil lamps.

9430 2018-01-23 03:22:32 Of course he did. He wants to take up back to the 1940’ using coal, fuel oil.

9432 2018-01-23 03:21:49 Big oil companies can start making synthetic.  Teflon based oils.  I think it could happen or wishful thinking.
9433 2018-01-23 03:21:43 Protect all of our coastlines. We need renewable energy, we need to get away from coal and oil.

9437 2018-01-23 03:21:14 Are you forgiving what happened to the olive oil or are you saying the olive oil is okay? I need answers, Mr. B!
9438 2018-01-23 03:21:08 Great time to ease regulations on oil drilling

9440 2018-01-23 03:20:58 I should go to Honda tomorrow and get my oil changed
9441 2018-01-23 03:20:39 Without the oil workers we would be in a world of hurt. Virtually everything we consume or produce oil is needed from food to the tires on your car,thank you !

9444 2018-01-23 03:20:16 Probably. They put a lot of money into the oil industry and pipelines.

9448 2018-01-23 03:19:57 Yes, but special interests rule the roost. This is really a huge victory for big oil. Meanwhile, the rest of the world will pass us by when it comes to solar power.
9449 2018-01-23 03:19:53 I drink water, use coconut oil, and mind my business and I’m still dusty. What step am I missing? 
9450 2018-01-23 03:19:51 Wanted to make scrambled eggs but I think I put too much oil

9455 2018-01-23 03:19:22 @JChurchRadio #f2bq Hey Jimmy, do you know if the Ancient Life Oil cbd can be vaped?
9456 2018-01-23 03:19:19 Perhaps. And perhaps in another parallel universe whales hunted humans to near extinction for human oil to light lamps and make perfume.
9457 2018-01-23 03:19:15 Biotin helps. Oil treatments too. No sulphate in shampoos....
9458 2018-01-23 03:19:13 Good thing we are screwing the Solar industry and not oil! Sounds like a great move.
9459 2018-01-23 03:19:12 Got my oil changed and my car washed and I’m so excited. I have a backseat again and my car looks sooo good clean

9466 2018-01-23 03:18:14 I’ve heard Weenie does love that tea tree oil shampoo! 
9467 2018-01-23 03:18:12 I wasn't picking on anyone. I just stated facts. I spent $30,000 on solar panels for my home. I appreciate all the oil & gas companies have done for cleaner environments also. Many school teachers retirements depend on oil & gas profits, so a lot of people benefit.

9490 2018-01-23 03:14:27 Drive up renewables $$ increases demand for petroleum increasing petroleum $$. Increasing need for imports who’s export is mainly oil?
9491 2018-01-23 03:14:24 Agreed, but got an idiot in the WH who only bows to the lobbyists and wealthy and seemingly is taking us back to coal days and now wants to kill Sea life in search of oil drilling.

9497 2018-01-23 03:13:46 Y por ejemplo cuando te hechan gas oil en un naftero o viceversa. Se le llama contaminar. Después tenés que sacar todo el combustible contaminado con el que no lleva y cambiar filtro de combustible. Si es que no le jodiste algún inyector (en el caso del diésel sobre todo)

9514 2018-01-23 03:11:43 Standard Oil was not a monopoly. Its productivity/output continued to increase while its prices fell consistently. By the time it was broken up by govt, its market share had fallen dramatically anyway.

AT&T was a government granted monopoly. Before that, there was competition.

9516 2018-01-23 03:11:38 if Trump is all about jobs why would he cripple the solar industry? Because clean tech does not support him. Oil does. Trump does what is best for him...always. So his 30% must always be fed. #trumpisafraud

9531 2018-01-23 03:10:59 Hmm. Interesting. Thanks fam. Think I’ll stick with the sneakerER paint pens for blacking out the Boost. Their acrylic instead of oil based and I’m extremely happy with the outcome.  If it ain’t broke don’t fix it.
9532 2018-01-23 03:10:54 rubbish.  it's #climatescience & you are a paid #Russianbot spreading #oil monger propaganda & conspiracy theories.  ciao
9533 2018-01-23 03:10:54 Saw Jessie Woo advertising the Haitian Castor Oil, Kreyol Essence, on IG. That’s beautiful. Yet another #TempleMade brand 
9534 2018-01-23 03:10:53 If only @blockbuster had the kind of lobbyists and donors coal and big oil do I could still go to my local store and rent Flubber again on DVD. #superstar
9535 2018-01-23 03:10:51 Essential oil blend: Bergamot, Patchouli, Ylang ylang - I'm addicted. 
9536 2018-01-23 03:10:46 All about coal and oil and the KKk but that last one has nothing to do with this lol #DTisdumb

9538 2018-01-23 03:10:36 This hot oil treatment is everything to my hair right now!
9539 2018-01-23 03:10:35 As far as I know, I invented that 5 years ago. It's like Twister, but it involves nudity, baby oil and tequila shots.
9540 2018-01-23 03:10:33 idk how yall put coconut oil ur face , that shit fucked my skin up
9541 2018-01-23 03:10:32 東京で20cm積もったら、会社や学校が休みに成るのはわかる。故に北海道では最高気温が35℃の日は休みにすべき。
9542 2018-01-23 03:10:32 I use to want things like a phone or a new video game for my birthday. But now that I’m older all i want is some new tires & a oil change for my car. adulthood is so garbage
9543 2018-01-23 03:10:29 #WePower project will curb the methane gas emmissions created by oil and gas producing energy plants. #RenewableEnergy will be the focal point of this project and many countries will benefit from this ! #SolarEnergy #ICO #cryptocurrency
9544 2018-01-23 03:10:27 OIL
9545 2018-01-23 03:10:27 これ？ドレッシングっていうか廃油。
9546 2018-01-23 03:10:24 Ladies, if you haven’t yet tried shaving your legs with baby oil? I best bet you try it!! Exfoliate, baby oil, and moisturize after. Can’t keep your hands off. 
9547 2018-01-23 03:10:16 Trump ran on the promise to create jobs. His tariff will lose us 260,000. Because he’s too busy doing the bidding of execs from big coal and big oil #ShitholePresident #ImpeachTrump
9548 2018-01-23 03:10:00 There's two feet of topsoil
A little bit of bedrock, limestone in between
A fossilized dinosaur, a little patch of crude oil
A thousand feet of granite underneath, then there's me

9549 2018-01-23 03:09:49 If your hair is thinning in some places, or you just want your edges to be thicker if you mix black seed, castor oil, and aloe Vera gel together and use it consistently your hair will grow back super fast
9550 2018-01-23 03:09:37 Oil price linked to intl crude price 
Oil tax linked to budget deficit 
Never the Twain shall meet
9551 2018-01-23 03:09:33 I know to use the toaster oven but I’ll try olive oil next time
9552 2018-01-23 03:09:32 Hey @Phillies I bought a 5 gallon bucket of coconut oil for when @rhyshoskins and @TheRealSlamtana bat 3 & 4 hole
9553 2018-01-23 03:09:10 I fucking hate coconut oil for the face
9554 2018-01-23 03:09:05 Saying that I’m ready for summer truly is an understatement. I’m so ready for fishing trips to oil center, cruise nights, and frog gigging.
9555 2018-01-23 03:09:02 On this topic, any favorite Olive Oil brands?
9556 2018-01-23 03:09:02 On #NewsDay with @nkemifejika discussing #USshutdown, #BabySwap in #India, #USGymnastics, #China oil spill and many more stories via @bbcworldservice
9557 2018-01-23 03:08:26 Toaster oven!!! Olive oil on top with some seasoning. Bake it only for like 5 mins
9558 2018-01-23 03:08:01 Solar industry braces for job losses as Trump puts fees on imported panels so many of these absurdities get passed over because MSM just talks about Stormy Daniels or Budget all day asking same questions of diff people all day this will make his oil friends richer & ruin climate
9559 2018-01-23 03:07:57 I’m getting her an essential oil diffuser
9560 2018-01-23 03:07:56 You'd think with @Warpcon just days away I'd be burning the candles at both ends, as well as the midnight oil!
But having already spent the month working on props to sell & with no game to write this shall be week of prep for table setup & finishing touches

9562 2018-01-23 03:07:30 My hair is so healthy... coconut oil for 6 hours ppl. It works.

9567 2018-01-23 03:06:51 i'm need to diffuse birch essential oil by itself one day. i do like it with the blend i have going on. but right now it is smoother than a peppermint e.o, and i'm not sure if it is the nature of the e.o, or the lavender & bergamont mellowing out the birch.
9568 2018-01-23 03:06:30 Also, the state is complete crap about money. How can we compete as a medical corridor wht they can't pay for the hospital? There's not enough oil revenue, blah blah. Such graft.

9574 2018-01-23 03:05:55 Increase Ethanol levels.  Ban oil.  Require everyone eat meat
9575 2018-01-23 03:05:39 That’s Trump doing oil and gas a favor.
9576 2018-01-23 03:05:33 I was thinking about coconut oil too
9577 2018-01-23 03:05:23 “& don’t get it twisted, sis. I wake up every morning next to a headscarf & coconut oil.” COME ON, RANDALL. 
9578 2018-01-23 03:04:59 Mineral oil + Kneaded eraser = sticky
9579 2018-01-23 03:04:21 OIL DIFF: 5.44 -> 5.47
9580 2018-01-23 03:04:09 For realllllll  

I do the coconut oil right out the shower without drying off . Then slap some Vaseline Cocoa Butter lotion on top of that . Air dry . And then go on with my day 
9581 2018-01-23 03:03:53 I just poured olive oil directly on a flour tortilla and ate it. It was actually really good, and I'd do it again.
9582 2018-01-23 03:03:45 Seriously @realDonaldTrump ? 30% tariff on solar panels?
An industry that has over 260,000 American jobs
An industry that is much more sustainable than coal or oil
An industry that is going to be a major part of our future
Why wage a clean energy war? YOU WILL LOSE
9583 2018-01-23 03:03:37 The joke is on you, idiots. There’s only one “essential oil” & it’s the kind not being blotted off my pizza.
9584 2018-01-23 03:03:26 Because he wants everyone dependant on putin/exxon’s oil n gas. Shocker.
9585 2018-01-23 03:03:24 @JulianAssange any info about Putin & Erdogan Deal in syrian Oil  land ?  US fake news all about poor Trump !can you report what happening in Syria ? after Syria  Turkey  attack #France & germany! Erdogan promised his solders 8 EU Virgin girl ! when he   make EU islamic Ottoman
9586 2018-01-23 03:03:22 Coconut oil is trash.
9587 2018-01-23 03:03:22 Caffeine helps a lot! Mint essential oil helps, before i was pregnant I would take 800mg ibuprofen and that shit worked wonders. But now I'm stuck doing natural remedies lmao
9588 2018-01-23 03:02:53 Sooo my coffee essential oil is here and I’m about to start diffusing it 
9589 2018-01-23 03:02:45 Will the expectations of oil reaching $100 negate the growth in this sector
9590 2018-01-23 03:02:43 Someone force me to get my oil changed tomorrow
9591 2018-01-23 03:02:32 I need someone to change my oil. Would you be so kind? It goes in through here... *spreads legs*

Also add fat to you vegetables. Cook them with butter or drizzle olive oil on them
9594 2018-01-23 03:02:17 Great...everyone finding out about avocado oil
9595 2018-01-23 03:02:06 Why add mayo when you can add an egg yolk and a half-cup of vegetable oil with out the mustardy tang to wreak havoc on the vanilla extract?
9596 2018-01-23 03:02:03 There are other and better oils than coconut oil... lol
9597 2018-01-23 03:02:01 Oil industry probably gets more govt money than all welfare and food stamp recipients combined. Could probably add in Medicare too.
9598 2018-01-23 03:01:57 1/Oh jeez, the $2B bankruptcy of Philadelphia Energy (biggest oil refinery on the east coast) is a hot mess of issues if I've ever seen one. You've got environmental issues, special interest groups, frustration with Trump, legal authority, globalization, corporate governance,
9599 2018-01-23 03:01:24 Y’all use anything besides coconut oil & witch hazel? 
9600 2018-01-23 03:01:02 I LOVE putting Eucalyptus EO in my oil diffuser I want to try mixing some oils together but idk which ones to mix lol
9601 2018-01-23 03:00:59 Coconut oil >>>>
9602 2018-01-23 03:00:59 @altonbrown I left a bottle of unopened olive oil in the car for the last month. It froze, unfroze, froze again, and so on. Still good?

I need to clean out my car.

9605 2018-01-23 03:00:38 I’m craving sesame oil so I wanna make some noodles, but this kid won’t sleep so I can’t 
9606 2018-01-23 03:00:35 I put coconut oil on my toes, this is another level of comfort
9607 2018-01-23 03:00:34 For those who are suffering from winter dry skin I recommend baby oil. Put a little on after you get out the shower and it does wonders
9608 2018-01-23 03:00:31 12時を、オイルがお知らせいたします。昼食にオイルが使われてるか探してみましょう。
9609 2018-01-23 03:00:22 Soften dry hair: Heat a half cup olive oil (don’t boil it), apply to your hair. Let it set for 45 minutes, then shampoo and thoroughly rinse
9610 2018-01-23 03:00:02 How Will Smith caused a new form of cancer based on oil slicks

9612 2018-01-23 02:59:32 Give your whole family vitamin D. Cinnamon, oil of oregano gelcaps and garlic. Read up on this remedy. All 4 are antivirals. They are harmless so it won't hurt to give it a try. Also heat up chicken broth in mugs in the micro, drink like coffee, prevents it also.
9613 2018-01-23 02:59:30 Olive oil , lemin juice, lemon zest, rosemary,sage,thyme and garlic. Salt and pepper
9614 2018-01-23 02:59:21 But pays back the oil tycoons.
9615 2018-01-23 02:59:09 I gave you an update on the accent origin on the Superwiki page. It's Mid-Atlantic and I'm sure @mishacollins knows it based on his 'oil rig in the Atlantic' comment.  It's from Old Hollywood movies.  Think Kathyrn Hepburn saying "nevah".  It IS a made-up accent.
9616 2018-01-23 02:59:00 Killing a much needed and successful industry to prop up oil and gas. WTF
9617 2018-01-23 02:58:55 Not coming at u or anything but coconut oil is comedogenic and does not provide moisture. It’s a sealant. These are facts.
9618 2018-01-23 02:58:39 Bath and Body Works “sleep” aromatherapy oil and “comfort” pillow spray is a vibe.

9621 2018-01-23 02:57:51 I found evening primrose oil helpful.
9622 2018-01-23 02:57:39 Y’all bragging about clogging up y’all scaly ass skin with coconut oil and it disgusts me. Each and every greasy one of you.
9623 2018-01-23 02:57:26 That's exactly what I figured. The little bastards (old white men) running our government want oil and coal, not clean and renewable resources. So let's just slap a huge tariff on solar panels! I am incredibly outraged & disgusted.
9624 2018-01-23 02:57:13 How can I be enrolled onto the  national oil and gas talent register portal with ministry of labour

9627 2018-01-23 02:56:57 One of my favorite things in the world is putting coconut oil on my feet and hands
9628 2018-01-23 02:56:09 Ok I hear u I well was going put tea tree oil in my night time regime.Cuz like if your skin too dry or u use too much product that dries out ur skin causing ur skin to over produce sebum and then it mixes with the dry skin cells causing acne ... I just want clear skin .
9629 2018-01-23 02:56:03 i love and appreciate you so much caznola oil
9630 2018-01-23 02:55:58 perhaps the main difference in our points of view is that most of my life oil has been selling for less than $10?
9631 2018-01-23 02:55:57 Smoking a blunt while babe rubs coconut oil in my hair. Much needed after a long day #woosah
9632 2018-01-23 02:55:42 Does your birthday come with oil down? 
9633 2018-01-23 02:55:33 His coal and gas donors would not be happy. Especially Putin's cronies with oil wells.
9634 2018-01-23 02:55:29 The Trumpski administration spells ethics "what the Koch bros., the oil companies and the NRA want".
9635 2018-01-23 02:55:06 There’s an oil for that.
9636 2018-01-23 02:55:01 Lovvvve the rose hair oil. Haven’t tried the wave spray
9637 2018-01-23 02:54:52 The goal here is to destroy any industries that affect the production of coal and oil. Many of the same folks that voted for this idiot will be out of a job.
9638 2018-01-23 02:54:48 February soon come and i can just SMELLLL the oil down 
9639 2018-01-23 02:54:34 すんまへん！
9640 2018-01-23 02:54:20 He's so "corrupt" that he's one of the poorest members of the Senate and he fights against everything the big banks, big oil, and big pharma stand for; so go ahead and keep voting against your self interest and believe everything you hear on Fox "news".
9641 2018-01-23 02:54:15 Oil will easily outlast human demand.
9642 2018-01-23 02:54:12 There’s a huge market for sustainable penguin oil.

9653 2018-01-23 02:52:32 Trump is trying to kill the solar industry for big oil and coal.  Germany and China are so far ahead in renewables.  Keep taking us back to the good old days, asshat.

9654 2018-01-23 02:52:29 Omg - with all the hair product in that house, Chelsea had not one drop of fly away oil?!! #TheBachelor
9655 2018-01-23 02:52:28 diffusing birch essential oil for the first time, (with lavender and bergamot). it is a new to me oil. i never expected it to be so "minty," a sweet wintergreen scent. reading more about it, i may have to experiment more with it in my massage oils, as it is good for muscles
9656 2018-01-23 02:52:26 Coconut oil is the primary reason i don’t breakout a quarter as much as i used to 
9657 2018-01-23 02:52:24 Taking a coconut oil bath is probably the best decision I’ve made in awhile
9658 2018-01-23 02:51:51 Now I get my oil changed tomorrow ..
9659 2018-01-23 02:51:48 I bought this really cute perfume oil and it’s infused with  cactus flowers and I’ve been watching them swirl around for 20 mins
9660 2018-01-23 02:51:38 Long story short, as oil traps moisture in your hair, it’s trapping “moisture” on ur face. Basically creating a nice little bacteria haven there, especially if prone to acne. If you have “good skin”, might get away with it, but oils really aren’t best, and some worse than others
9661 2018-01-23 02:51:38 I'm having a recurring fantasy of getting a massage with some CBD 90% and THC 10% oil rubbed into my aching back by some really strong hands
9662 2018-01-23 02:51:27 Tired of your rants.Make American jobs making solar panels & wind turbines for ALL FEDERAL BLDGS. Oil$ will drop US gov’t should invest in solar & renewable energy and beat China. We cannot win w/o help from gov’t.
9663 2018-01-23 02:51:26 Ok and u n ur yacht thatll use 100x the fuel any average person would and u be protesting the oil and fuel haha u a hypocrite. Maybe go back to the 15 century and get ur wood stove stoked up if u dont like it haha 
9664 2018-01-23 02:51:25 lots of lifted feet and rest! Not much longer to go  (try lemongrass oil to help relieve some swelling)

9666 2018-01-23 02:51:09 The Republican party is already done. Yes, the right wing hid out in Texas throughout the progressive era. Once oil is illegal/no longer useful economically a lot of problems disappear. No more oil subsides to underwrite the right wing for one.
9667 2018-01-23 02:50:58 Jamaican castor oil!
9668 2018-01-23 02:50:57 Can he make it more obvious that’s he’s sucking big oil’s tit?
9669 2018-01-23 02:50:37 My daughter playing in baby oil after I said dnt , and now she has it in her eye ... Now Ima beat her while she's blind cuz she dnt listen 
9670 2018-01-23 02:50:22 That won’t help his oil baron friends.
9671 2018-01-23 02:50:15 You should teach them how to draw an oil well
9672 2018-01-23 02:50:00 She must glisten from the oil slick she produces through her pores in order to be as slick and slimy as she is in the Press room. #oily
9673 2018-01-23 02:50:00 I paid $32 for Urban Decay Oil Control setting spray and was really disappointed it wasn’t working but my dumbass was using a hydrating foundation. Literally just putting more oil on my face.
9674 2018-01-23 02:49:58 So oil and gas?

9676 2018-01-23 02:49:52 Use castor oil it works better
9677 2018-01-23 02:49:45 Whoever introduced me to canned tuna in vegetable oil rather than water, you have changed my life and I can’t thank you enough  (I think it was @Alyse_Callahan )
9678 2018-01-23 02:49:39 Economics will always triumph over politics and the Russian state is running out of money. He has burnt through the state reserves & has annexed the state pension fund. If oil stays low IMO within 2 years they will start to default on debt. West will then dictate bailout terms.
9679 2018-01-23 02:49:36 Not only the billions paid to hugely profitable oil companies - but even the timing of stoplights, which could be coordinated for no stops if you drive the speed limit (as at Oak Ridge), are timed so you'll use more gas. I wonder why?
9680 2018-01-23 02:49:26 Also put jojoba oil, coconut oil, and water in a spray bottle. Spray it all through your hair and leave in over night. 
9681 2018-01-23 02:49:12 Uh, that’s a plus for the Crook-In-Chief’s oil & gas buddies, eh?
9682 2018-01-23 02:49:06 太るから?だから僕を突き放すの?オイルが嫌いなの?オイルに罪は無いだろう…?
9683 2018-01-23 02:48:45 And also. Thanks for calling me dense.  I'll refrain from letting my inner oil patch worker loose on you.
9684 2018-01-23 02:48:43 Motor oil works
9685 2018-01-23 02:48:41 Canadian politicians have imposed a carbon tax on the fossil fuel industry even though the fall in oil prices has hurt the industry and caused thousands to lose their jobs. The politicians have an ideology-first attitude.
9686 2018-01-23 02:48:31 bc fuck the environment. This is why I dislike trump. The death of fossil fuels is inevitable and @realDonaldTrump is keeping America locked out of the future all to save dying oil/coal
9687 2018-01-23 02:48:22 I usually do 1 cup of rice, oil in a pan and rice let it dorar in poco, blend tomato and onion with 2 cups of water add it to the pan then add consome and consomate 
9688 2018-01-23 02:48:10 today i purchased makeup revolutions oil control setting spray and im currently testing it out
9689 2018-01-23 02:48:06 Oil people are republicans.

9694 2018-01-23 02:47:19 In the service of big oil oligarchs.
9695 2018-01-23 02:46:23 My eyelids are super oily cause I put too much castor oil but I want my lashes to grow
9696 2018-01-23 02:46:15 shit irks me so much moe every day i get on twitter dot com to see someone talking about how coconut oil and drinking water didn't make their skin clear
9697 2018-01-23 02:46:11 Nothing like getting your skin back on track on the face.  And then fuck it back up getting oil pores in the middle of the night. Fuck man lol.
9698 2018-01-23 02:45:50 Never thought the engine would malfunction... maybe I shouldn’t have put in that olive oil.
9699 2018-01-23 02:45:50 No worries, it's always good to ask questions!
Caviar is a really awesome bud, covered in oil then allowed to dry a little, then rolled in kief. They're awesome as a topper or if you wanna watch your friends face plant, in a joint.
9700 2018-01-23 02:45:49 You only need to follow the dollar, who gains, in this situation oil moguls seem to have the most to gain with such a tax.
9701 2018-01-23 02:45:47 Psalm 23:4-5 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; For You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me. You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; You anoint my head with oil; My cup runs over.
9702 2018-01-23 02:45:32 You can borrow a cat.  Peppermint oil repels mice (not sure how well).  The electric traps are far more merciful than spring or glue traps.
9703 2018-01-23 02:45:28 Yes!! The non-whole 30 version consists of a little butter, white wine and lemons. This one is for Whole 30, so I used a cast iron skillet (which is great for flavor & color), olive oil, LOTS of fresh lemon juice, and the same seasonings as the veggies.
9704 2018-01-23 02:45:23 @lizzo COCONUT OIL
9705 2018-01-23 02:45:10 @realDonaldTrump does not care this will pad the coffers of his benfactors (big oil?kochs) and that is the important thing.
9706 2018-01-23 02:45:08 Black girls ain't using coconut oil for everything. Took the yts long enough to figure that one out. I use it for my hair, for cooking and sometimes for my daughters baths. DO NOT USE IT ON YOUR FACE.
9707 2018-01-23 02:45:06 It's a fried bread that I topped with garlic, garlic olive oil and cilantro.
9708 2018-01-23 02:45:04 I put coconut oil on my eyelashes. Hopefully they’re twice as long tomorrow

9711 2018-01-23 02:44:35 And then asked why we would want people from shithole countries coming here. I don't trust anything out of this snake oil salesman's mouth.
9712 2018-01-23 02:44:20 I can only access the hemp kind here but I did research which ones aren’t snake oil. Glad to hear a positive review from you!
9713 2018-01-23 02:44:18 Of course/who needs alternative energy over coal & oil
9714 2018-01-23 02:44:16 coconut oil is so good, I'll eat a spoonful..or two by its self
9715 2018-01-23 02:44:01 We’re gonna roll with a hella starter blend  in furrow.  10-34 with humic acid, micro package, big shot of iron, and some snake oil.  Also treating the seed with quickroots.  First attempt at beans in 7.8-8.2 ph
9716 2018-01-23 02:43:51 No lie I would be putting mad coconut oil on my face and be pissed about being ashy seconds later. I ain’t know no better

No problem girl! I hope it works for you! I had to be patient with mine since i tried so much stuff beforehand
9721 2018-01-23 02:43:32 It’s so wild that all things health/beauty that are trending now (kombucha, oil pulling, coconut oil, facial steaming, juicing, diffusing essential oils, etc.) @austinajjj has been doing + talking about for YEARS now! Such a proud big sis 
9722 2018-01-23 02:43:30 He's trying to increase oil dependence for Russia. Get him out.
9723 2018-01-23 02:43:17 Almond oil and argan oil have changed the game for my skin care routine.

9730 2018-01-23 02:42:02 So these guys broke into the bathroom shower and stole the coco butter oil!
9731 2018-01-23 02:41:57 Also, I used to work for an oil field service co and they received government money to drill wells. So they drilled many wells that didn't produce and still got paid. Standard practice for these companies. Should we pick on them too?
9732 2018-01-23 02:41:56 I used shea butter on my entire body instead of coconut oil last night and it changed my life
9733 2018-01-23 02:41:33 The rest of the industrialized world including oil rich countries are investing in solar while Mr Trump takes this country backwards. Let’s open up drilling around the entire US, except FL, lets deregulate everything and cut the tax on oil companies that help pay for clean ups!
9734 2018-01-23 02:41:27 Gotta get up early for an oil change
9735 2018-01-23 02:41:24 I can’t spend the night if you don’t have coconut oil
9736 2018-01-23 02:41:11 I have it too and it’s sucks.  I can’t wear short sleeved shirts without feeling self conscious.. but exfoliating with a Konjac sponge (google it), rinsing with coconut oil, and moisturizing helps reduce it a lot.
9737 2018-01-23 02:41:05 hmmm maybe watercolors and oil paintings
9738 2018-01-23 02:41:00 Kl aku sih tambah madu atau olive oil[]

9740 2018-01-23 02:40:22 The number of folks I’ve seen microwaving metal bowls and not opening windows/turning on the fan when cooking something with oil..........
9741 2018-01-23 02:40:21 heckle and jeckle: gay

9745 2018-01-23 02:39:31 What about solar workers and businesses? What about farmers who are moving to solar? This is straight bullshit because Trump has buddies in the Coal and Oil industry.
9746 2018-01-23 02:39:25 Blood an Oil should have never been cancelled.
9747 2018-01-23 02:39:24 Let's stop buying gas and oil. Cold turkey it. How about putting our money where our mouth is?
9748 2018-01-23 02:39:19 If you do it right, you even get the oil of exorcism, used only on the unbaptized to strengthen them against the Enemy.
9749 2018-01-23 02:39:13 Saddest thing that can happen is spill your wallflower bath and body work room scent oil all over your carpet. It was new too 
9750 2018-01-23 02:39:11 Yeah, and coal and oil kills birds, as well as the entire planet.
9751 2018-01-23 02:39:02 *Put more oil on the kart* Heh HEH heh #Dingobot
9752 2018-01-23 02:39:02 He wants to enrich himself and his cronies. Probably get $$$ from oil companies.
9753 2018-01-23 02:38:58 Trump has no intention of helping anyone steering away from oil and coal. He owns no stock in it. He's selling off America's park lands to rich Russians and Saudi's in exchange for massive profits at America's expense. Don't worry though, he'll make millions.
9754 2018-01-23 02:38:50 I wasn't really being nice or mean.  Just stating that the Alberta follows the price of oil.
9755 2018-01-23 02:38:46 Wish him the best. But that foot injury will just continually hamper him. He needs to get some magnesium oil to strengthen that foot. Most people are magnesium deficient it’s the #1 cause of arthritis which is the bones screaming for nutrients!
9756 2018-01-23 02:38:26 Big oil money pulling strings...
9757 2018-01-23 02:38:23 I rarely put butter on my bread. Now, olive oil & balsamic? YES. And I love to put chimichurri on bread when I'm at an Argentinian restaurant.
9758 2018-01-23 02:38:20 It’s amazing! Use it sparingly at first and let your skin adjust, I didn’t and it was too harsh and my face got swollen and was peeling for 4 days . I’d say like once a week to start and as soon as you wash it off put an oil on. Sorry for the unsolicited advice

9760 2018-01-23 02:38:11 Don't be silly Stephen, the cunning plan is to build secret hidden drilling rigs into the support columns of the bridge. They'll also be building secret hidden piping into the bridge itself to transport the secret oil to shore. You're obviously not an oil man!

9765 2018-01-23 02:37:08 Why did I put on all of this coconut oil lol. Fuck I think I’m safaree
9766 2018-01-23 02:37:07 Olive oil
9767 2018-01-23 02:36:55 Of course. Just like the hole on the ozone layer “disappeared “. And “ peak oil” never happped. It’s just the cause of the moment !
9768 2018-01-23 02:36:53 Keep our coast for people, not for oil profits!
9769 2018-01-23 02:36:46 Lol neither.    But the falling dollar will push oil prices higher.  Good luck

9798 2018-01-23 02:32:06 Sir what is your take on Legalizing Cannabis for medicinal and industrial purposes? Cannabis oil has proven to have cancer killing properties and hemp products for a industrial revolution. Ban on Cannabis isn't a ban of fundamental Rights?

9806 2018-01-23 02:30:26 Wrong, fracked oil makes money at $65.  This is a fact. We can extract at this value for 30 years. Until then $100 oil is, pardon the pun, a pipe dream. Oil pays my bills so I know.

9824 2018-01-23 02:28:11 @jaketapper you and all the media need to hit this hard. This is a gift to the oil and electric industry.
9825 2018-01-23 02:28:11 Apparently, your ignorant mind doesn't know that propane is made from oil and natural gas.
There is OBVIOUSLY ONLY ONE here who DOESN'T need to read a book.

9827 2018-01-23 02:27:57 Pernia: Any increase in oil will not be good for the economy but it depends on the extent of the increase. Effect of TRAIN increase on fuel will be transitory and be felt in Q1 and Q2 but will peter out @rapplerdotcom

9840 2018-01-23 02:27:00 That sounds amazing! My go-to quick tofu side dish is topping with soy sauce, sesame oil,, bonito flakes, and scallions, but I will definitely try it with garlic next time. Thank you for sharing!

9843 2018-01-23 02:26:22 Canada, while the U.S. is imposing tariffs on solar energy, should start R&D-ing on that ASAP.
I would be thrilled to see Alberta go from an oil province to a leader in solar power.
9844 2018-01-23 02:26:16 LA ... everywhere. That 16m “thing” btw is outta control. I know - location - location - location is 80% of the value but unless this is sitting on a gold mine or a oil field, Malibu has cheaper homes and pretty awesome views.
9845 2018-01-23 02:26:11 Not to mention improved national security for America when we decrease dependence on foreign oil.
9846 2018-01-23 02:26:11 Because Oil, Drill, frack all National parks, monuments, off shore beaches and back yards is where 45s cabinet is about. Has nothing to do with an adversaries interest in oil. NO CLEAN ENERGY. NO PROTECTING OUR ENVIRONMENT. So wake up America.

9851 2018-01-23 02:25:46 It wasn’t all the time. Only when thimagine new kid got annoying. We let him play the time traveling game where we jumped on an old oil drum in the empty lot next door and pretended we traveled through time.
9852 2018-01-23 02:25:37 i slathered peppermint oil on my back u cant hurt me
9853 2018-01-23 02:25:36 No problem!! Also tea tree oil is good for dark spots and acne scars. I mix like two drops in with some of my clay masks! Has helped a lot! And salicylic acid is good for acne
9854 2018-01-23 02:25:21 Y’all pray for me. My oil sticker says come back at 14,568 miles BUT MY CAR IS at 17,372 rn. First thing in the morning !!

9857 2018-01-23 02:24:56 Oh, because of the Obama tax cuts, all the regulations his administration cut, his support for the coal, gas, and oil sectors, his huge mfg push and the renegotiated trade deals? Spin that propaganda to your loyal (62% of those polled) followers. No on else is swallowing it.

9860 2018-01-23 02:24:08 are you sure that's oil?
if so, damar resin, heat, pallet knife.
9861 2018-01-23 02:23:59 What happens is solar gets priced out if the market because American made solar isn't going to random get cheaper so people don't buy it and instead stay on the grid, which this pro fossil fuel administration uses to justify huge bailouts for coal  and subsidies for gas and oil
9862 2018-01-23 02:23:57 It is cronyism, plain & simple. He is pro-extraction tech (coal, oil, etc.)

So he wants to see *those* interests (e.g. Tillerson, et al) - and ONLY those - thrive like bandits. Tariffs like this are the worst kind of slap on the face.

9868 2018-01-23 02:23:36 Yeah, in Mexico taco shells don't really exist. You pan fry with canola or other frying oil of choice. After you fry, stuff it with lettuce, cotija cheese, sour cream and taco sauce (blanched tomato blended w tomato sauce, cilantro and water) then hot sauce. Enjoy 
9869 2018-01-23 02:23:24 Trump's version of energy independent US also needs oil above $100+bbl. You can't drill baby drill if the oil costs too much to extract. They go hand in hand, hence the buddy buddy relationship/election help. 

What else you got?

9880 2018-01-23 02:21:49 .@NEDAhq chief Ernesto Pernia says TRAIN seen to accelerate household spending in 2018 and thus boost growth. But admitted cash transfer implementation needs “accelerated” to offset inflationary pressures from higher oil prices.
9881 2018-01-23 02:21:42 snake oil, basement to carnival, panic...too far back?
9882 2018-01-23 02:21:34 Overall you’re better off using olive oil cuz coconut oil has higher saturated fat (bad fat) & extra virgin vs regular is just how it’s made so like the acidity levels & vitamins/minerals change
9883 2018-01-23 02:21:27 Truffle oil is disgusting and impossible to cleanse the palate of and generally the laziest move you can make to give your dish flavor is the hill I'll die on

9889 2018-01-23 02:20:45 Yes, I address risks to the longer term in Oil Fall. That said, I just reviewed the UK data overnight. After a flat year in 2016, combined wind and solar got right back on the growth path in 2017, reaching a new notch of 17% share of UK electricity. Hard not to be positive!

9893 2018-01-23 02:20:19 hey Arnold you are such a disgrace, you should be ashamed of yourself just think of all the job for the illegals the oil rigs would provide. I think you need to think about it.
9894 2018-01-23 02:20:17 The Keystone problems, from demonstrations about concerns over sacred lands, heavy tar sand pipeline oil leaks & drinking water aquifers showed why Obama was reluctant.
Trump reversed economic collapse regulations: as high risk loans sold by banks as quality investments.
9895 2018-01-23 02:20:11 People who think coconut oil solves everything are just hypebeasts and bandwagoners

9899 2018-01-23 02:20:03 Africa having its economy and culture devastated by US colonialism? Sure. It's horrifying. If this thread had started as a post about South Africa using oil i would not have posted what i did. Probably wouldn't have posted at all. Trump is the epitome of colonialism though.

9920 2018-01-23 02:18:06 You do know that the US govt has been funding a regime change in VZ since the oil reserves were found and they didn't allow BP in there, right? Do you know about the economic warfare tools the CIA has used in VZ?

9927 2018-01-23 02:16:58 I agree. Coconut oil doesn’t do shit for dry skin. I’ve had to resort to this stuff called Working Hands to keep my skin from cracking open on my hands. I sometimes put it on my lips but I put cocoa butter on the rest of my skin.

9934 2018-01-23 02:15:31 This is what the tweets & articles I have read today have been saying. Trying to slow down the movement away from oil & coal at the expense of clean energy that he can control. Also read that WH cannot impose tariffs as it is a legislative action.

9973 2018-01-23 02:10:51 Russian oil companies.
9974 2018-01-23 02:10:39 I presume scrubbers would be what are described as "approved compliance equivalence method" which allow a vessel to carry high sulphur fuel oil

9983 2018-01-23 02:09:46 Thanks for the reply, I agree. Should we also take some solace that in the COT report everyone but the MMs are also short for the most part? Is that a good thing?
9984 2018-01-23 02:09:45 What about palm oil?? Shouldn't  their be a substitute
9985 2018-01-23 02:09:45 Rural areas are the landowners. They maintain land w farms, ranches, oil, timber, minerals, power, wildlife, transportation routes. These areas feed the nation and provide cities w raw materials. Land ownership is a big responsibility, unlike just living in an apartment.

9987 2018-01-23 02:09:30 If coconut oil isn't good for everyone, what's good for dry scalp?
9988 2018-01-23 02:09:16 Stripping regulations that prevent another recession, drilling for oil off our coasts and in national parks, anti-environment. Encouraged racists to come out of the shadows, made us laughing stock of world, tax cuts for middle class temporary, no infrastructure investment

9991 2018-01-23 02:08:56 "It's just, people think you went after Iraq for his oil -- "

"Iraq is a bitch motherfucker who was asking for it"

"Okay but you know after he went to the ER they said SOMEBODY broke in and took all his oil"

"You think you're some kind of cop, huh? You wanna start something"
9992 2018-01-23 02:08:51 I'm not really buying the idea that the administration that wants to get rid of subsides for renewables while bailing out coal and oil is interesting in keeping solar competitive. And killing jobs to create jobs is an interesting concept
9993 2018-01-23 02:08:51 oil money shortcut likely in the end
9994 2018-01-23 02:08:35 Just in case anyone thought that when the GOP clamors for "energy independence" they didn't really mean "more business for the oil companies".

10006 2018-01-23 02:06:59 Oh, it is always such a problematic and easily mockable road to go down when men like yourself start complaining about "lazy" illegals.

Your "job" is just selling snake oil to sad people, dude. At least have the dignity not to defame people who are actually working for a living.

10009 2018-01-23 02:06:19 @QuestNutrition I noticed the (awesome) new birthday cake protein bars still use palm kernel oil. I thought Quest stopped using it in all new products? Will bday cake continue to use palm kernel oil?
10010 2018-01-23 02:06:14 this looks like an oil painting
10011 2018-01-23 02:06:02 Oh no. Garlic, olive oil, red pepper flakes + lemon zest help a lot. Good luck.
