2 2018-07-04 23:59:52 Why build refineries when it cost billions to the oil companies. They’re happy how it is now

4 2018-07-04 23:59:15 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
5 2018-07-04 23:59:11 Wow. You really have no idea how oil prices are set. You also have no idea that if oil prices go down, unemployment goes up in the oil industry. Let that sink in. Oil companies like higher prices bc they can invest in further tech which employs more people.

10 2018-07-04 23:58:36 A failed economy due to reliance on oil wealth that plummeted when the price per barrel dropped from a high of $110/barrel to below $40, due to the Saudis trying to break the US oil industry by ramping up production.
11 2018-07-04 23:58:32 FDR also extended a helping hand to struggling oil companies. Of all the social programs that grew out of the Great Depression, Big Oil subsidies are still supported by Republicans 86 years later. Programs related to actual, human beings are continuously maligned & under attack.

41 2018-07-04 23:57:07 Well this is a bad way to end a nice 4th...got a package from @Bloomingdales via @UPS which I didnt see was covered in black oil or something and now D's new @Bonobos shorts are completely ruined and unwearable.

44 2018-07-04 23:57:02 Lip oil is better than lip gloss .
45 2018-07-04 23:57:00 You want to punish the Canadian economy for this rediculous idea that the world will stop using oil if we do.. they won’t, places like India, China & the Middle East have their economies running on fossil fuels and they won’t stop until they have a cheap & efficient alternative
46 2018-07-04 23:56:57 If that's true why in Canada we are paying double? I work in the oil industry and the people are getting Sh^* on for the prices thanks to our liberal GOV.
47 2018-07-04 23:56:52 watch for the removal of the sanctions....and high oil prices influenced by trump tossing the Iran agreement greatly benefit Russia
48 2018-07-04 23:56:49 I get it, you are not bright. Please, go read the Iran deal and when/how much oil they were allowed to sell under that agreement. Then stop, think (for yourself), and understand what is allowed now that Trump rescinded. Reading is fundamental, but not much fun for you trumpkins.
49 2018-07-04 23:56:46 It's not very sexy to have to leave foreplay to go to the kitchen and microwave coconut oil Q you sweet little egg
50 2018-07-04 23:56:38 You do realize oil is a commodity whose price is determined by by traders based on supply and demand and perceived world tensions. OPEC can't simply lower the price. And by the way, we import more oil from Canada than we do from the OPEC countries.

53 2018-07-04 23:56:19 And, Trump still thinks the US gets to keep the oil and gas it produces.
54 2018-07-04 23:56:18 Bout time to get back on this oil for the night 
55 2018-07-04 23:56:10 Por isso que fico no spotify quando acordo na madrugada para escrever ao som do Midnight Oil
56 2018-07-04 23:55:50 Owo, they were living in cave, France brought civilization which is a result of colonization. The 14 countries don’t actually have a central bank and don’t print their own money. Togo has crude oil that belongs to France.
57 2018-07-04 23:55:42 GaRBAGE MAN TRUMP   YOUR HATRED OF AMERICA CAUSED THE OIL PRICES.  YOUR RACISM AGAINST MINORITIES CAUSED THE OIL PRICES.  YOUR HATRED OF ALLIES AND WORSHIP OF RUSSIA CAUSED THIS  SLIMEBALL
58 2018-07-04 23:55:41 After giving oil investors massive loopholes in his tax scam nobody (I'm not including Fox viewers) actually believes that he cares about rising oil prices.
59 2018-07-04 23:55:27 Omg I didn’t even think of the affects this has on our poor veterans. I feel so bad now! I’ve been using a calming oil on my dog all day since people have felt compelled to light them off all day long...
60 2018-07-04 23:55:14 oh word? what powers everything when the sun goes down?
61 2018-07-04 23:55:12 Let’s see how that will go. Where is advocating harm here? The tar sands are already working and the oil is transported on trains (which happen to also emit a lot of GHG), so apart from the normal self righteous approach the NDP is known for, I’m not sure what your argument is.
62 2018-07-04 23:54:59 Drinking olive oil was a bad idea. I’m feelin.... S L I P P E R Y
63 2018-07-04 23:54:58 We don’t need OPEC’S oil. Divest NOW!!
64 2018-07-04 23:54:56 OH MY GOD, you start a trade war with half the damn world, then when prices for our internationally made items goes up, you sit and tweet about the OPEC nations, and how they should fix it! They control most of the world's oil, but sure let's piss them off too 
65 2018-07-04 23:54:53 いつもより余計に回しております〜、ワコーズOILは最高級品ですね絶賛換毛期で毎日執拗にブラッシングされてるアトルーはげんなりしてます(´･_･`)
66 2018-07-04 23:54:52 This Pure Fiji Guava Infusion Exotic oil, smells so yummy.
67 2018-07-04 23:54:47 This is not the gilded age. This is the age of oil and plenty and communication. The median income in CA is 42,000 which means if you are earning that before taxes you are in the top 1percent worldwide. Scalpers are not the problem. Supply is.
68 2018-07-04 23:54:44 لا فيه حل ابسط من كذا لاتشترون لهم مايكات يتكلمون بها كذا مايقدرون يتواصلون معهم
69 2018-07-04 23:54:43 Come on out west and I'll take you whalewatching. That way you'll see first hand why we need to protect critical habitat for endangered Southern Resident Killer Whales from potential #TransMountain tanker oil spills.
70 2018-07-04 23:54:35 I do not believe we placed tariffs  on Canda's oil products
71 2018-07-04 23:54:26 Food. Water. Energy. Oil. Uranium and other metals. We used to have a decent manufacturing base and used to make all kinds of cool stuff, but our politicians have been selling our manufacturing sector out to China for decades. Maybe one day, again...
72 2018-07-04 23:54:10 In any case, why should anyone help you? This is a self inflicted wound brought in by unjustly pulling out of the JPCOA with Iran and putting sanctions on them. You no longer buy oil from them, your supply decreases the price increases. Simple isn’t it?
73 2018-07-04 23:54:05 This sounds very boutique but I don't wanna tell a boy I'm about to gape "hang on I gotta go microwave some coconut oil" you know
74 2018-07-04 23:54:05 These leftists protesting in favor of child sex trafficking. Lord help us.
75 2018-07-04 23:54:03 What a surprise, the US oil parasite has found a new host to suck the life out of...
76 2018-07-04 23:53:59 In a way yes if you think not competing and sitting on your hands is a good thing. I purposely didn’t include oil which has left this province at a drastic rate. Other companies see tax breaks and are leavening while ndp do nothing you have to compete to keep business
77 2018-07-04 23:53:34 "Trump said Saturday that he had received assurances from King Salman of Saudi Arabia that the kingdom will increase oil production, "maybe up to 2,000,000 barrels" in response to turmoil in Iran and Venezuela."  Liar
78 2018-07-04 23:53:28 熱心に選んでたのかーーーーーｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗ
79 2018-07-04 23:53:20 Mr President you know that the oil price went too low and lost a lot of investors their pensions because of US fracking during the Obama years. Only Saudi Arabia and Russia are capable of producing enough oil to effect the POO which is market driven.
80 2018-07-04 23:53:06 equivalent of watering down a barrel of oil with a tear drop
81 2018-07-04 23:53:02 My Darling,
The MAGAt Horde, with Alex Jones held high on a palanquin of gold, arrived silently with the morning dew.
We gave them fidget spinners covered in baby oil and they've been busy for days.
War is hell.

82 2018-07-04 23:52:58 shit i never really use any kind of lube but when i do i just put a spoonful of coconut oil in a bowl and melt it in the microwave, it’s good for your skin apparently
83 2018-07-04 23:52:56 Bernie Finn must be misinformed- Australia is already rapidly converting to renewables AND they're cheaper than coal... 

Or is he just supporting his Liberal Party donors - the COAL & OIL & GAS INDUSTRIES??
84 2018-07-04 23:52:53 They want their own Country from the British govt And their jihadists from stealing oil and gas. REFERENDUM SOLVES THE PROBLEM.
85 2018-07-04 23:52:51 You mean, besides trying to set up a plan to save the midterms? With Syria, Poland and Iranian oil in play?
86 2018-07-04 23:52:51 The reason OPEC is charging more is because trump has chosen to leave clean energy and go back to oil the reason Obama era gas was cheap was because OPEC had to lower prices to bankrupt clean energy THANKS GREAT DEAL MAKER TRUMP
87 2018-07-04 23:52:50 Power supply is a political issues, i expect to see light when a person that studied energy management is the minister oil Energy. or we wait until no country buys our oil and gass bc they use electric cars. then we use our oil to produce electricity.
88 2018-07-04 23:52:47 My mom be giving my female friends hot oil treatments and hair/skin tips.
89 2018-07-04 23:52:42 Yes. The face oil is a great any time moisturizer. The beard oil is great too.
90 2018-07-04 23:52:36 Where can I get a tune up and oil change for my motorcycle ?

92 2018-07-04 23:52:26 Are you going to start buying oil from your Russian buddy Putin?
93 2018-07-04 23:52:22 Sensasi pake cetapil, bio oil, dan natrep ketika mau bobo adalah pas bangun tidur muka lembut bat anjeeer 
94 2018-07-04 23:52:13 St. John’s wort oil
95 2018-07-04 23:52:12 Yeah, really not much to it. Grilled eggplant, grilled onions, diced tomatoes, olive oil and I cut up basil and used the basil flower/oregano as decoration. My mom made it once and I liked it so I thought I'd bring that to counterbalance the abundance of meat.
96 2018-07-04 23:52:12 I guess you don't understand that the point of a monopoly is to drive prices up so that the monopoly can maximize profits.  This is why 19th century Progressives fought to break up businesses, and why Standard Oil was broken up into literally dozens of smaller companies.
97 2018-07-04 23:52:08 Shout out to cbd oil
98 2018-07-04 23:51:59 Looks like the pressure of high oil prices is growing on him as midterms approach..just see  how soon he will reverse course on Iran and say..'Sanctions...what sanctions...I love Iran':)
99 2018-07-04 23:51:58 Mr. Trump. Part of making America Great again is total oil independence.  Why aren’t you going after Amer. Oil CO’s to + production and - gas costs to Americans.  You gave them their pipelines.  Now tell them to put out more locally or turn the lines off
100 2018-07-04 23:51:47 less twitter, more tantrum, that should help things. YOU have officially admitted that the U.S. is NOT able to counter the expected removal of Iran’s oil export volumes with its own shale production boom. Stable genius?
101 2018-07-04 23:51:44 These 2 R oil and water!

Trump-
Loves America
Believes in Americans
Works to make America better
Donates salary
Optimistic
Freedom loving

Obama-
Hates America
Has no faith in Americans
Works to destroy America
Got incredibly rich in office
Pessimistic

103 2018-07-04 23:51:36 HAPPY 4TH //// Specials Tonight: olive oil poached tuna with caponata, Roof Verbena marinated watermelon salad, Pulled pork sandwich, 1/2 rack of ribs with Texas toast and Red-white-blue potato salad
104 2018-07-04 23:51:33 Logic is snake oil to these people. Unfortunately, in the rare instance a person stands up against the race/identity/selectively outraged mainstream the sheep within it try their best to destroy him. I support anyone who stands up and risks their livelihood for what they believe.
105 2018-07-04 23:51:32 I want to say this book reminds me of the tv show Dallas, but I have neither seen the show or know what the show was about except it was set in (I’m assuming) Dallas and was about an oil tycoon fam. 
106 2018-07-04 23:51:25 Dropped a vat basket straight out the oil on my arm in work n I have one belter of a burn
107 2018-07-04 23:51:22 ねっむ
108 2018-07-04 23:51:17 How about reducing our dependence on oil and gas???  A smart person would start shifting us into solar and wind ASAP....
109 2018-07-04 23:51:17 Need to get my tarte maracuja oil after work
110 2018-07-04 23:51:06 Alright, I’ll admit it. I love me some foot!!! Some complained I lingered a bit long with Mags and the oil...
111 2018-07-04 23:51:00 Our ally the British govt is supporting Continuous GENOCIDE of Hebrew Biafra to steal oil and gas. The world is SILENT.
112 2018-07-04 23:50:57 For an outsider, Australia not using uranium looks as absurd as if Saudi Arabia banned oil use.
113 2018-07-04 23:50:38 See there you go. I never one said all Muslim immigrants. You have your talking points down pat. I lived in Houston for 30 years. Lived with a very large Muslim population. Oil biz. I know the difference between assimilate and  never willing to assimilate. Expand your knowledge.
114 2018-07-04 23:50:34 We need lower gas prices now. We are transporting our oil out and our gas prices continue to raise. Taxes at the pump keep raising too. It appears the additional money made is just going in the tank.
115 2018-07-04 23:50:33 And this comment coming from  OIL ... that’s a joke
116 2018-07-04 23:50:06 #OOTT #Oil #WTI #BRENT 
See how desperate #Trump is now. He is fighting a beast of surging oil prices before #US midterm #election. After then, what #OPEC is doing will be none of his business anymore.
117 2018-07-04 23:49:56 From the guy who thinks gas tax should be raised. Pfffffft!  What have oil companies done with their huge GOP Tax Scam breaks. Certainly didn’t pass them on to workers or consumers.
118 2018-07-04 23:49:19 The US needs to focus on energy independence. The US is wasting precious resources in the Middle East which should be used to develop our energy independence even unilaterally taking all the Arctic oil. High gas prices is America's award for ending the Iran deal & Iran sanctions.
119 2018-07-04 23:49:12 オイルがあるから、みんな生きているんだYO
120 2018-07-04 23:49:11 And nothing so UN-American as Trump & Zinke ripping our national parks to shreds by selling off millions of acres to lumber, oil, mining & fishing industries & our endangered park animals to trophy hunters. FDR would speak softly & hit this administration with his big stick.
121 2018-07-04 23:49:11 Thinking about how vulnerable we were to crackpots in the weeks after the 2016 election. Otherwise reasonable people were retweeting Eric Garland and sending Jill Stein money. Crazy time. Wish I had had some snake oil to sell.
122 2018-07-04 23:49:06 Taking a shower with your girl, be prepared to be in there for 1 hour, because she has to apply her face mask, shave with coconut oil, exfoliate with her mango scrub, wash her hair, put a hair mask on, lather up with her beauty bar, rinse, and repeat with her body wash....
123 2018-07-04 23:48:40 The EU is even more pro-Putin. It's not at all unrelated to the fact that the UK is deathly dependent on Russian LNG and the EU at large is highly dependent on Russian fuel generally and oil specifically.
124 2018-07-04 23:48:32 Lol the oil I use for my Diffuser is very subtle and sweet. If you have/get a diffuser I promise you won't be    dissapointed with the aromatherapy version
125 2018-07-04 23:48:30 Do you know what a monopoly is ? OPEC produces about 40% of the world's crude oil
126 2018-07-04 23:48:26 How about your oil industry friends find a way to make less profits? Oh wait, you are probably making a killing too.
127 2018-07-04 23:48:19 Going short definitely gave me a lot more volume, I felt like mine was super flat. The only product I use besides oil is a John Frieda root pumper it’s so great! Not washing your hair is so hard especially when your hair isn’t use to it, it gets so oily.
128 2018-07-04 23:48:18 Does anyone use CBD oil or take products with CBD in it?
129 2018-07-04 23:48:16 Name your own now!! lol
130 2018-07-04 23:48:03 War torn men and families demanded better health care returning from prison camps and six years of war especially Japanese German torture. Food rations got worse after war without cottage hospitals clinics and invention of penicillin introduction of orange juice cod liver oil etc
131 2018-07-04 23:47:38 Im sympathetic to that, but the NDP needs voices to try to pull it back when it drifts too close to the center. Breaking the myths around the oil sands is a start.
132 2018-07-04 23:47:27 there is no security threat between Canada on Mexican on American Donald Trump is very lie to American people he is a mystery  maker to other country the oil price in America is very expensive nobody willing to do business with Donald Trump he is not man of is own
133 2018-07-04 23:47:19  That’s about the dumbest proclamation you’ve made yet. OPEC isn’t an American corporate conglomerate, and it’s the American corporations that are making the huge profits for oil products. On top of that, they were given the huge @GOPTaxScam breaks.
134 2018-07-04 23:47:17 USE COCNUT OIL! It’s my saving grace currently!
135 2018-07-04 23:47:13 Canada’s methods are likely cleaner than oil harvesting in the Middle East. America can look that way for energy needs. So why not get two birds with one stone on the pipeline debate? Better for environment and economy here. Less tankers and train oil spills.
136 2018-07-04 23:47:11 Put castor oil on it

139 2018-07-04 23:47:01 I thought @realDonaldTrump's big bad keystone pipeline was going to lower gas prices & reduce our dependence on ME oil.  OH that's right - tariffs against Canada.  Genius!

But it's GOTTA be someone else's fault, #Cult45. No blame must ever land on the altar of the #GoldenCalf
140 2018-07-04 23:46:55 Russian oil- look at Trumps opec comments
141 2018-07-04 23:46:52 Why do oil companies still get their tax break? We were told it was tax reform and for exchange for the cut we would see an end corporate welfare (my name not theirs). It didn’t happen. It’s why we call it a #TaxScam
142 2018-07-04 23:46:47 No xq no subió el gas oil
143 2018-07-04 23:46:46 So you give your dog CBD oil?
144 2018-07-04 23:46:38 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
145 2018-07-04 23:46:36 At one point I accused an audience member of wanting to cover young boys in olive oil (don't ask). Got off stage and the nicest comedian in the world 
 @EvanCarterCmedy said "what the fuck was that?!" @Brianhopecomedy loved it.
146 2018-07-04 23:46:35 omg i need to work out or some shit cause i had cow intestine last night and that shit was LATHERED in oil and it felt like eating just the fat of lechon it was both  and  at the same time
147 2018-07-04 23:46:33 Snake Oil cured my gullibility.
148 2018-07-04 23:46:26 Apparently it's too hard for you to read more than one sentence. Try hard. You blamed trump for sanctions on Iran being the cause. There are no new sanctions on Iranian oil. Even if there was, it wouldn't be the president, it would be Congress.
149 2018-07-04 23:46:24 Those transformers leaking oil are likely leaking toxic PCBs as well.
150 2018-07-04 23:46:20 Trump's so stupid he doesnt realize in this tweet.....by saying he asked that king to increase production, that will make oil/bbl go down. Those guys in U.S. waiting for oil to come up to work are being screwed!!

& that doesn't affect price at pump!!
151 2018-07-04 23:46:10 It's been so hot that my coconut oil jar has completely melted
152 2018-07-04 23:45:57 You are in Russia. Sad you play on the emotions of others. Sick. Why RU July 4?  Constituents know you're secretly meeting with Lavrov? Making $$$ on oil&gas pipeline scamming Americans?  #TreasonWeasel. @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems  RU loves GOP!  Ask @RepPeteKing. leaker
153 2018-07-04 23:45:56 Fun fact: Kaz is actually a nickname. Her real name is Castor Oil cause no one likes her and she’s tasteless. #LoveIsIand #NoSnakesAllowed
154 2018-07-04 23:45:49 a true dictator would just invade Venezuela and claim their oil.
geez, no wonder you were asking about this.

But it's GOTTA be someone else's fault, #Cult45. No blame must ever land on the altar of the #GoldenCalf
156 2018-07-04 23:45:49 Im pretty sure if you want America to produce more oil we need higher prices.
157 2018-07-04 23:45:46 I remember the guy climbing the oil derrick!
158 2018-07-04 23:45:44 And you're still on movies. Hey Jack, your orange man-whore in the White House is rage-tweeting about OPEC and high oil prices. Might want to focus on that.
159 2018-07-04 23:45:44 Johnson’s baby creamy oil and it also smells so good and the Off clip on repellent! 
160 2018-07-04 23:45:28 Start pumping in Oklahoma again. I thought we were self-sufficient on oil
161 2018-07-04 23:45:08 I thought @realDonaldTrump's big bad keystone pipeline was going to lower gas prices & reduce our dependence on ME oil.  OH that's right - tariffs against Canada.  Genius!

162 2018-07-04 23:45:07 Nothing is more patriotic than spending the 4th selling barbecues at my retail job to oil the machine of capitalism
163 2018-07-04 23:44:57 Huh? Why would I be protesting that. I want Canadian oil going which means I want the pipelines built and tankers shipping out of there. Do some research before commenting. The Vancouver area is dumping raw sewage into the ocean. Wake up buddy.

165 2018-07-04 23:44:49 Oil companies are the biggest thieves in this country they are gouging us big time
166 2018-07-04 23:44:38 Too bad nobody in the WH cares. As long as he is destroying the environment, planting oil wells in Yellowstone & the Arctic wilderness, fouling oceans & destroying the US alternative fuel program, he's good to go. I'm one of the ATMs Pruitt uses to buy his special pants & lotion.
167 2018-07-04 23:44:34 Why don't you slap some tariffs on their oil? That'll teach 'em, right??
168 2018-07-04 23:44:29 さてさてほほーーーーーーｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗ
169 2018-07-04 23:44:26 It’s Wall Street driving the prices of crude...and oil companies responding. And mostly BECAUSE THEY CAN....and we can’t do a damn thing about it. We won’t get rid of our gas guzzlers. It’s like the junkie complaining to the pusher about the price of crack.

172 2018-07-04 23:44:16 The bill of good being sold to Aggie fans (and recruits) by the snake oil salesman is unreal. Can't wait for more 8 win seasons in aggieland. There is a reason Tallhassee wasn't sad to see him go. #enjoyjimbo
173 2018-07-04 23:44:15 そこそこ珍しい雨量ですけどこれくらいなら大丈夫そうですね。ちょっと水路の様子を見てきます
174 2018-07-04 23:44:14 excuse me but penis oil lol
175 2018-07-04 23:44:05 Oil prices are determined by forces of  demand and supply. So how do you archive your threat when you are not a member? #saynotoopression
176 2018-07-04 23:43:51 you should probably pore? pour? poor over something with words on it to learn how oil becomes gas and if there might be another reason causing gas prices to go up other than oil supply. #irandealsayswhat

179 2018-07-04 23:43:47 Your boss Vlad is very happy oil prices are going up.
180 2018-07-04 23:43:46 TRUMPAGANDA 

OIL PRICES HIGHER BECAUSE TRUMP RENEGED ON IRAN DEAL.
IRAN KEPT THEIR PART OF DEAL.
U.S. RENEGED ANYWAY.

DON'T WORRY, OIL PRICES WILL BE LOWER BECAUSE OF TRADE WAR.
IF TRADE STAGNATES, THEN SHIPS LOADED WITH GOODS WON'T TRAVEL FROM & TO U.S.  MUCH LESS  OIL USE.
181 2018-07-04 23:43:40 Thought we where oil independent??
182 2018-07-04 23:43:35 Whaaat? I cannot stand the smell of tea tree oil !
183 2018-07-04 23:43:30 Of course -  it is actually relatively easy to achieve (1/2):
1) black undercoat
2) "heavy" dry-brush with very dark silver color (to give some texture on the main part of the armor, and keep the lines/recess areas black)
3) apply nuln oil in recesses to further accentuate lines
184 2018-07-04 23:43:24 Buy her new AirPods and free oil change!
185 2018-07-04 23:43:20 Well we have a group of oil tanker protesters hanging from a tall bridge in Vcr., wearing kites over past day.  After 30 hours, police are getting them down.  I don’t like police tied up in this type of stuff, even tho I’m against tankers.
186 2018-07-04 23:43:20 Che Asti ...y el Gas Oil Productivo q prometió el Dr en 1999 y 2004 demorará mucho ??
187 2018-07-04 23:43:18 God bless the USA an the big oil companies that keep me working #oilfeildlife #godblesstheusa
188 2018-07-04 23:43:08 So it's not just that ocean levels are rising, it's not just that we're running out of oil, it's not just that we'll be running out of drinkable water soon, we're also running out of sand and there's plastic in all the food we eat because of all the garbage in the ocean.
189 2018-07-04 23:43:07 What do you mean?  I thought the pipeline you pushed through was supposed to solve that problem.  Oh wait, that oil was only good for low grade diesel that can't even be sold in the United States.  Made your buddies richer but did nothing to help the dumb fucks who voted for you.
190 2018-07-04 23:43:02 In 1986 Saudi Arabia raised #oil prod. from 3.5M bpd to 10M bpd so #oilprice dropped:
$32 to $10 in 0.5yr
This had a role in
1991 USSR collapse (main export was oil)
Iran-Iraq war ended in 1988 (no money)
Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 (Iraq debt problem)
US & CND oil ind. collapsed
191 2018-07-04 23:42:51 お気を付けて
192 2018-07-04 23:42:43 You are really naive despite the education.  You choose to impoverish our country to support weak arguments while the world craves the oil that will enable us to be a powerful wealthy country.
193 2018-07-04 23:42:39 Let’s see now. I have a friend with a serious chronic illness living in her car b/c she can’t afford rent. They’re talking about drilling for oil off of CA again. DHS and HHS lost 2,000 refugee kids the administration was using as hostages. Community clinics closing. Dershowho?
194 2018-07-04 23:42:35 #Adeboye & #Kumuyi have most number of rich yorubas working in #FulaniYorubaNigeria IOCs. #Yorubas remain in favour of Nigeria's unity for selfish reasons, oil contracts, Oil Company staff placements & oil blocks. #BiafraExit #IPOB
195 2018-07-04 23:42:24 Of course it’s gouging! The oil companies have jacked prices up every summer and around every holiday for decades now. Every year we bitch about it, or some politician promises to look into it, and they still continue to do it. We buy V8 trucks...we’re obviously NOT that worried.
196 2018-07-04 23:42:18 So we just continue with a logical phase out of oil and gas.
197 2018-07-04 23:42:16 Thunder shirts? Check! Essential oil? Check! Drugs? Oh yeah, you bet! I mean...Check!
198 2018-07-04 23:42:09 Last time I checked Venezuela exports OIL . Nicaragua exports Nicaraguan people. Who gave more money to Potus CITGO or poor Nicaraguans.
199 2018-07-04 23:42:04 You just don't get it. They just met and set pricing. Do you understand what your comment implies? Oil prices going up thanks to our incompetent president!
200 2018-07-04 23:41:40 Honey, you aren’t “thirsty”...far from it. 
201 2018-07-04 23:41:39 Mint oil works better
202 2018-07-04 23:41:05 I wonder what costs more... air conditioning at Lucas Oil Stadium, or properly hiding the NFL markings there prior to a USL match.
203 2018-07-04 23:40:57 Not on July 3d you didn't!  You were in Moscow hoping to meet secretly with Putin.   Busted. Senator, why are you in RU July 4?  Do your constituents know you're secretly meeting with Lavrov?  Are you making $$$ on oil&gas pipeline scamming Americans? SHAME. #TreasonWeasel.
204 2018-07-04 23:40:55 Lol trump will bitch about oil prices like he doesn’t realize that OPEC holds mass amounts of oil and can put us into a crisis again.
205 2018-07-04 23:40:43 You Do Have Something To Withdraw Mrs Mahere ? Thats Like Crying For A Chocolate Icing On A Cake When I For One Am Planning On Where I Can Get That 'Gorosi' And Some Cooking Oil This Guy Gottu Survive Ndotobika Magwinya. We Dont Even Have That Something To Withdraw

211 2018-07-04 23:40:25 Due to salicylate sensitivity, I'll switch from coconut water & bananas to instead get my potassium from kale, cashews, and potatoes. I may also get a Potassium Citrate supplement for that extra bit to take with food, and am considering trying Borage Oil, re: delta-6-desaturase.

218 2018-07-04 23:40:01 @oil_shaeikh Happy Birthday 
219 2018-07-04 23:39:55 You had a bin of coconut oil with ice
220 2018-07-04 23:39:45 I can't decide which version of olive oil to buy...Virgin...Extra Virgin...Whore or Extra Whore? #oliveoil
221 2018-07-04 23:39:42 Check the shipping lanes. One pipeline will not do any more harm than the thousands of ships cruising btwn island and mainland. How do you think Alaska gets their oil to Washington? Hmmm. Hypocrite
222 2018-07-04 23:39:32 I don't think that's going to happen. Maybe try getting the oil companies to use their big tax cut to lower their prices, rather then increasing profits. Wouldn't it be the patriotic thing to do? Or maybe you should ban oil speculation since it can artificially inflate oil prices
223 2018-07-04 23:39:20 He wants to look powerful and of course divert attention when the mueller report is released. What’s he going to do, take their oil?  He sure doesn’t care about their people.
224 2018-07-04 23:39:06 Yeah...let's upset the guys who set the price of oil.  Great going.
225 2018-07-04 23:39:05 Then they should get on board with stopping the pipeline. There will be NO cruises happening when no tourists come to BC after the first oil spill.
226 2018-07-04 23:39:04 The Iran deal has nothing to do with oil.
227 2018-07-04 23:39:04 day 4 in the sun: i finally have a tan (thank u coconut oil)
228 2018-07-04 23:38:44 好印象かぁ。
今から習字でも習うかww
229 2018-07-04 23:38:35 Put it this way the US is self sufficient in Oil, best to use up other Countries first....!
230 2018-07-04 23:38:34 That's my take on it too! Build the wall and it cuts off, or greatly diminishes their income. All they're left with really is oil production.
231 2018-07-04 23:38:34 Remove Iran sanctions and help Americans with cheaper oil prices. If America 1st always, then Iran sanctions make America last.. Rethink! MAGA!
232 2018-07-04 23:38:22 He doesn't want to help Venezuela. He wants their oil.
233 2018-07-04 23:38:21 Telling them to pump like my 4 year old tells me she wants ice cream.  They don't have the oil, I don't have the ice cream!
234 2018-07-04 23:38:17 Pretty much the same thing I always put in: Rice, pigeon peas, butter, scotch bonnet pepper sauce, sriracha, chicken thighs, salt/garlic powder/sesame seed oil/black pepper to taste.

I mix the pepper sauce in with the rice and beans and layer the chicken on top.
235 2018-07-04 23:38:11 Oil demand is growing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly oil/Gas at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off buildings. Obstructing Canada’s Gay friendly oil = killing #LGBTQ. We hope these eco-terrorists get jail time. @vancouverpride
236 2018-07-04 23:38:06 BROOOO i just spilled my whole bottle of aloe vera oil and I just want to cry rn
237 2018-07-04 23:38:04 Hmmm I need a list of CBD oil brands #CBD #cbdoil
238 2018-07-04 23:37:57 #Iran revolutionary guards ready for more lies and superstitious!

No more finances!

Above all, #Oil and #Gas #swap deals will be at risk!

#OPEC #OOTT
239 2018-07-04 23:37:53 But that's AMERICAN oil, with Rights, right?! We need some of that inhuman FOREIGN oil to burn and exploit for work, no?!
240 2018-07-04 23:37:53 You think you rule them too.
The way you get oil prices to go down is make renewable energy a priority in the USA. Which you stopped and are continuing to hurt with your energy policy.
ANOTHER PROBLEM YOU STARTED
241 2018-07-04 23:37:48 Yer definitely on my list ;P so hot!!!
242 2018-07-04 23:37:24 Hopefully oil price decreases
243 2018-07-04 23:37:16 Lol, it is a narrative when it comes to oil companies. You have some actual facts with relevant contexts to back those claims up?
244 2018-07-04 23:36:49 Make a reason, start a war and you get oil for free. That's the American way.

246 2018-07-04 23:36:46 Why we have plenty of oil here and in Sadia
247 2018-07-04 23:36:44 おはありです！！！
248 2018-07-04 23:36:35 I do what I can to not support oil, but assume that of me if you wish.

254 2018-07-04 23:35:48 Fully agree, if we have to pay for their oil, they should pay for our military help.

257 2018-07-04 23:35:36 Why do we need OPEC setting oil prices?  Let's start pushing more oil production within the U.S. to eventually careless what the rest of the world is producing.  When will ANWAR start impacting oil production?  We also need to be exporting more oil, right?
258 2018-07-04 23:35:28 Big Oil has been using Big Tobacco’s playbook for years but the end result will be the same.
259 2018-07-04 23:35:20 lil homie pissing out motor oil lmao
260 2018-07-04 23:35:19 No, spray oil, accidental slips happen!
261 2018-07-04 23:34:56 OPEC is the opposite of a monopoly: it's a group of countries with nationalized oil reserves.
262 2018-07-04 23:34:50 It’s called the Art Of The Deal. It’s how oil works. Guess it hurts when your not the one making the deal, huh?

264 2018-07-04 23:34:41 The Minister of State for Petroleum, Ibe Kachikwu will visit Ogoni on the 9th of July, 2018. The reason is unknown, but many are insinuating that it might be connected with plans for resumption of oil activities and for exoneration of the slain Ogoni heroes.

266 2018-07-04 23:34:37 @jakejakeny @i24NEWS_EN Yes keeps USA oil men employed
267 2018-07-04 23:34:29 Oil is a commodity and like any other commodity prices are determined by supply and demand. If you hadn't stop American innovation in improving fuel efficiency then we would be less dependent.  I guess it didn't work out for you.
268 2018-07-04 23:34:13 You forget China has been funding Venezuela’s debt load. I would think China would do almost anything to ensure debt is repaid (oil). “Gunboat” policy, as you phrase it, would be late to the party and a mistake.
269 2018-07-04 23:34:04 Feel a #coldsore coming on? Dab the spot with tea tree oil, nail polish remover or even vodka....these can prevent it from blossoming

277 2018-07-04 23:33:12 Why don’t you add tariff’s to oil for national security. That makes sense.
278 2018-07-04 23:32:56 Snake oil, kids. Ffs.
279 2018-07-04 23:32:45 #Thump is lying again and blaming OPEC to cover he's the reason oil and gas is spiraling higher! It's beneficial for Russia and the Saudis to have higher prices, lower prices hurts their economies. Our gas prices will be much higher by Nov. thanks to him,don't be fooled by a con!
280 2018-07-04 23:32:41 trump train, this guy draining the swamp and oil motza, his gunna be awesome president sir.
281 2018-07-04 23:32:37 You don’t know how Oil works do you? But guess what, the United States is the number one producer of oil in the world so lower prices affect the US more that anyone. Please take an economic course.
282 2018-07-04 23:32:37 Whatever was in that vape oil just changed my life
283 2018-07-04 23:32:31 Hi Kelly: 1. Dont wet leaves when watering, never; 2. Good idea to water in mornings so if leaves get wet accidentally they have time to dry out; 3. Make a repellant using need oil, liquid soap and soft water (google for ratios) (or buy - Hipro, White Mark ask for NeemX)....
284 2018-07-04 23:32:28 …And, really, WWI was partly about regime change and fiddling, too — Standard Oil was deeply interested in what happened to the petroleum in Arabian lands. Quite a lot of modern Middle East problems can be traced to the way we, the UK, and France divided the peninsula.
285 2018-07-04 23:32:15 今日のコメンテーターにはよつさんがゲストとして登場するからめっちゃ楽しみだし、おそらく今日はあいんすの試合があるとからそこでもにこにこしてる。
286 2018-07-04 23:32:10 yeah well how many barrels of oil can be put in the back of a average car trunk .  those things are big and heavy . gotta have kids all hold up the oil drums to 1000's of cars waiting up for gas deals

290 2018-07-04 23:30:58 If the oil give up on pulju, there’d be 30 teams ready to take him on. He’s gonna be a stud. Oil fans need to learn some patience.
291 2018-07-04 23:30:52 Trump you are bullying independent Worls countries again. Sad you think bullying works in Foreign politics the you are the fool Kim proved that to Americans. Other countries will reduce oil production to increase oil prices to offset You money bullying. Trump how Dumb are you.
292 2018-07-04 23:30:50 Shiro story :oil mad I saw the actor on the first purge today as well. Knew he was a British actor
293 2018-07-04 23:30:50 OPEC's members: Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Venezuela.The Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander said he was ready to prevent regional crude exports if Iranian oil sales were banned by US.
294 2018-07-04 23:30:46 Blend 4 1/2 tbsps grapes with 2 tablespoons celery. Add generous amounts of Olive Oil. Stir-fry. Serve with chili
295 2018-07-04 23:30:45 @LoriShemek you're bringing up healthy cooking ideas in me. Have you ever tried Aubergine cooked and then make a tomato based sauce with garlic, coriander and  add cumin then add the cooked Aubergine to it. It's a traditional Moroccan dish and healthy because you add olive oil.

298 2018-07-04 23:30:25 I can't do it. Edibles only for me I'm afraid. Waiting for legalisation in IL (or a trip out of state) so I can get some oil. Have an idea for a BBQ sauce that would make for an interesting cookout.
299 2018-07-04 23:30:19 Very Stable Genius™ strikes again. Do tell me more about oil prices @realdonaldtrump

301 2018-07-04 23:30:00 Didn't have to try and get an okay to invade a country rich with oil reserves either. He was seriously trying to get approvals to invade Venezuela? WTF?!?

Trump is pondscum.
302 2018-07-04 23:30:00 Your friends and cabinet must be making a fortune, are they getting ready to short oil after your tweet?
303 2018-07-04 23:29:59 BREAKING: BP buys near-controlling stake in massive Clair oil field West of Shetland from Conoco
304 2018-07-04 23:29:57 Big surprise here...OPEC may have some influences over gas prices because of price per barrel. American oil companies are mostly to blame because of their greed to keep their profit margin up
 Refineries go down for service, prices go up up up. NOT RIGHT.
305 2018-07-04 23:29:43 No oil no interest
306 2018-07-04 23:29:43 True.
307 2018-07-04 23:29:30 Has he noticed Israel has no oil of its own?

#tastraffic
310 2018-07-04 23:29:12 Right, you prefer the oil stays in the ground approach and the bankrupt province.  Do youeven live in Canada?
311 2018-07-04 23:29:07 The fireworks have started
Last year I had to sit with the 2 fur babies wrapped in a blanket and held them tight for hours due to the fireworks
This year I gave them CBD oil and they are resting on the couch and not paying attention to the fireworks
312 2018-07-04 23:29:04 I’m sure they find your usage of all caps very convincing.

So remember that Iran deal you walked away from?

Even I know that’s why oil prices are going up.

Thanks, Trump.
313 2018-07-04 23:29:03 What the president and his advisors dont understand is how their trade policy affects dollar pricing. Isolationalost policy = strengthening dollar = higher oil prices since oil contracts are priced in USD. It’s the global order that’s been in place since Nixon. Now on jeopardy.
314 2018-07-04 23:28:52 You’re delusional. Oil prices plummeted with the American sanctions on Russia. The U.S refused to cut down shale production even when OPEC did. The U.S caused this. Oil sands crude isn’t profitable when Oil is $50 a barrel. Carbon tax had nothing to do with it.
315 2018-07-04 23:28:51 4's waist is oil.
316 2018-07-04 23:28:48 Put some oil
317 2018-07-04 23:28:21 I bought a bottle of wintergreen oil a while back, which was sold in a 1 dram bottle. The expression “wee dram of scotch” isn’t kidding. It’s tiny.
318 2018-07-04 23:28:15 Do you really believe them, they're making that money man! Trump isn't giving no weak position countries no breaks. What goes around, comes around. They know Trump would be charging them up, big time, if the U.S. had the oil, and they were asking for some cooperation. Trump Rules
319 2018-07-04 23:28:14 @MikeHudema I'd take you more seriously if you admitted that a huge amount of your funding comes from American funded companies backed by American oil coporations. You're a smug lying hypocrite and your organization is a joke.
320 2018-07-04 23:28:12 Your Russian friends are the reason for oil prices rising. Check yhe deals they've been making with the OPEC states.
321 2018-07-04 23:28:11 We have so much oil and so much coal!
322 2018-07-04 23:27:54 America and Americans first!! We must produce more oil here! We should rely on no one for anything!! #AmericaFirst
323 2018-07-04 23:27:45 Reduced regulations on oil and having more off shore drilling is the answer! Step up our production! American independence!  This will drive down our costs and make the USA rich
324 2018-07-04 23:27:44 I gave you the source. The Narwhal. Easy to find the article. You have to ask yourself what the motives are for both oil corps and environmentalists. Oil companies are about their profit. They already pay dirt cheap royalty rates to make huge profits.

326 2018-07-04 23:27:30 Because the govt now allows US produced oil to be exported. Plain and simple.
327 2018-07-04 23:27:26 Go get those oil companies that are hurting the working class.

331 2018-07-04 23:27:09 Love how these lefties support moving US coal through BC ports. Coal that produces far more CO2 than Oil, yet only complain about AB oil going out of the province. #TheLeftDoingTheBiddingofUSResourceCorporations 
What a bunch of suckers, you putzes are.
332 2018-07-04 23:27:06 My love for the environment is too big! People be making me feel crazy for talking about what the oil companies are doing to the land, plants and animals
333 2018-07-04 23:27:05 Again, my point is, how is it any different than NHL players diving when they're barley touched or throw their head back via the phantom high-stick, etc..
334 2018-07-04 23:27:03 Wrong! Oil prices are up because the U.S. economy is humming!
335 2018-07-04 23:27:02 Or WHAT?!?! You gonna put a tariff on imported oil too?
336 2018-07-04 23:26:56 How about our oil companies? Can’t they make up the difference? Are not doing more drilling?
337 2018-07-04 23:26:54 Seeing how we import less oil, we shouldn’t be feeling this. How is a war with OPEC winning??
338 2018-07-04 23:26:50 Why are you lying? These gas increases are a result of your misguided policies You have given the oil and gas industry significant tax and environmental passes to bolster their profits. #impeach #Indict #trumps
339 2018-07-04 23:26:46 Donald,i know you think Canada should roll over and give you anything you want.but venuezela has oil too and you could divert Mexicans that way.
340 2018-07-04 23:26:30 You seem bright.  Why do you think the world can drop oil tomorrow and survive?  We don't just burn this stuff, we turn it into many different products.
341 2018-07-04 23:26:27 Lovely oil lamps. Mine are packed away now along with glassware I will never use nor will my daughter.  But, OH and AGA, lucky you. Can't even touch them here, they are so pricy.

344 2018-07-04 23:26:16 #tRump, your grasp of the gas & oil market is staggering. (not surprising given your alleged real-estate acumen)

Maybe OPEC benefiting from oil prices being up is why they’re doing little to “help.” Just a thought...

#TrumpDerangementSyndrome
345 2018-07-04 23:26:12 How about we just pull ourselves totally away from opec & Saudi oil and we just use our own? We have enough oil within our own boarders to serve the US for several hundred years & then some. 

Tell the big oil companies to go F themselves and we take care of our own.

Truth comes out Ebs people will be angry.
353 2018-07-04 23:25:26 Reduce pricing now????  How about sending that tweet to your billionaire buddies in the gas/oil business?  They look for ANY excuse to gouge us at the pump. "There's a storm that MIGHT disrupt oil shipments" Let's raise the price at the pump 30 cents!
354 2018-07-04 23:25:21 I thought you were planning on invading Venezuela and taking all of their oil? you are a traitor to the American people in the world at Large.
355 2018-07-04 23:25:11 @NoLore not sure youre aware but theres 12 brave people hanging from a bridge to stop oil tankers in bc. Some have done Facebook live. Its amazing how threatening and violent comments from white Albertan men are.
356 2018-07-04 23:24:53 #America now goes on it's knees with @realDonaldTrump crawling on his knees to the Saudis to beg for help keeping oil prices down.  Are we #MAGA yet?  Because I am very #SickOfWinning

360 2018-07-04 23:24:27 If they din't see that potential in him, spending $2.5M on the guy makes zero sense. There were far better and proven options that would have cost the same or less
361 2018-07-04 23:24:24 And threatened Venezuela, oil prices sky high, china Tariffs will kill US farmers, EU Tariffs will impact steel and auto workers, please I can't afford all this winning
362 2018-07-04 23:24:00 Ayyy, it’s 4th of July, where’s all the US stealing oil memes???
363 2018-07-04 23:23:57 After Iran's President warning to disrupt oil export through Persian Gulf  U.S. anounced ready to protect Persian Gulf oil routes from Iran
364 2018-07-04 23:23:33 I always cook cauliflower dip it in eggyolk and then stir fry in vegetable oil. Then serve with coriander and salad.
365 2018-07-04 23:23:29 that's why going into Venezuela was spoke about [hint] oil
366 2018-07-04 23:23:29 Olive oil is safer.
367 2018-07-04 23:23:22 Good thing that you’re meeting with Putin soon. After all, Russia is the second biggest oil supplier in the world after Saudi Arabia.
368 2018-07-04 23:23:18 Just like your tariffs, they are going up and you are not doing anything to help.
Why aren't you producing more oil?
369 2018-07-04 23:23:08 Oil, oil lines and markets for oil?
370 2018-07-04 23:23:06 Happy 4th of July.

Because Oil execs couldn't handle adapting to a new market Climate Change is going to kill Millions if not Billions of people because we didn't solve our emission problems soon enough.
371 2018-07-04 23:23:05 Because the US is now the world's largest exporter of oil, OPEC literally has NOTHING to do with the price of gas in the US. There is NO EXCUSE WHATSOEVER for exporting all of our oil before first taking care of America and Americans. US OIL EXPORTATION IS CRIMINAL.
372 2018-07-04 23:22:56 Oh Donnie boy. The fake shortage created by your favorite, big oil, is why gas prices are so high. You don't give a damn about the working stiff. You just lap the asshole of big corporations, but that is the Republican way.
373 2018-07-04 23:22:48 This is exactly why I'm trying proposing a business plan fer a vegan  truck. I make some dam good vegan  and even rice, bean, & notCho cheese burritos that are salt, oil, & sugar free...!
374 2018-07-04 23:22:47 Yeah right- 2 words Russian oil
375 2018-07-04 23:22:46 I figured out why the GOP is doing what they are doing. they want to hold on to power as long as they possibly can... or they are trying to be billionaires... forget millionaires... get that money while they can! You notice everything has gone up in the last year!! Oil.. drugs
376 2018-07-04 23:22:28 Remember when Trump said we should’ve grabbed the oil when we invaded Iraq? Does his coziness with Putin make sense now?
377 2018-07-04 23:22:23 Those who can will have by then left and the country settles into irrelevancy. But I doubt it. The oil and education levels gives the country a lot of natural advantages. All it needs is a restoration of sanity.
378 2018-07-04 23:21:48 Real problems break opec up why do the Middle East have to control our oil prices
379 2018-07-04 23:21:45 Agreed but my point is it had better not be coming from the Oilers
380 2018-07-04 23:21:43 Tak laaa, kita guna yg murah jee, oil cleanser biore tu je anis.
381 2018-07-04 23:21:39 that's what they say at the oil refinery, alternatively, verbatim

383 2018-07-04 23:21:14 I want to know the American people want to know. Is the phone booth in Pruitt's office leased, leased with an option to buy, or is it free & clear  &paid for by an oil company?When his wife finds him a job will it then be in the lobby of Trump Tower or does he get to take it home
384 2018-07-04 23:21:11 Typical of @GreenpeaceCA  protest Cdn oil and never to be seen protesting foreign dictatorship oil....#crickets
385 2018-07-04 23:21:01 Agreed he was looking for the best spot to prove his worth, though I don't think he's a true No. 1. Excellent backup and would be a nice fit in a 1A/1B tandem.
386 2018-07-04 23:20:56 What must these Russians be saying about this group of spineless traitors willing to sell their country for oil $$$.
387 2018-07-04 23:20:44 Bennett. Yes, by Jove, Mr Dedalus brought pouch and pipe. Alacrity she served. He blew through the Oil and Gas Commission and other 1/4
388 2018-07-04 23:20:44 @MikeHudema Hey Mike, why haven’t you ever blockaded oil tankers bringing heavy oil from Alaska to the 5 refineries in Washington? Why doesn’t @Greenpeace do anything about the many tankers at any time near your HQ in Amsterdam?

392 2018-07-04 23:19:58 Maybe if the US stopped trying to destroy the oil industry in Iran & Venezuela there wouldn't be a problem with pricing.
393 2018-07-04 23:19:53 But....I thought you just spoke to King Salman and he agreed to more oil production?
394 2018-07-04 23:19:53 Who else used oil on paper to get tracing paper, when he/she needed some?
395 2018-07-04 23:19:36 Trust me it's all about the OIL:  production, equipment, price collusion etc. All of these senators have states where oil and gas figure prominently!  Eric Prince will be sniffing around the summit, mark my words!  Magnitsky Act sanctions are at stake.  STOP the f*ing corruption
396 2018-07-04 23:19:35 Northing. The opposite. He's poured oil on Brexit every day since 1975.
397 2018-07-04 23:19:35 Global price...So every other busy energy producing jurisdiction was affected? No. Regulatory uncertainties and a Carbon tax made investment flee. Aside from Venezuela and Canada energy never quit booming. Look up major projects like Kazakhstan and Belgium...and that's just oil.

400 2018-07-04 23:19:15 So you agree that we are basically protecting them for Oil. Nice.
401 2018-07-04 23:19:13 Build more refineries to drive the price down. We have enough oil. With USA a top oil producer now then high price oil brings  more revenue and jobs for this industry. Until you build more refineries the price of gas will be regulated by those that refine.
402 2018-07-04 23:19:10 Man I was smoking a L and then hit that THC oil around 1. Fell asleep high af,  woke up at 7 and smashed sum food. Why tf am I still HIGH AS FUUUUUUCK!????
403 2018-07-04 23:19:04 Hi. Hello. This is a PSA to alert you that @bathbodyworks “happiness: bergamot + mandarin” body oil makes you both happy and spell like a treat.
404 2018-07-04 23:18:57 Perhaps Trump's grandstanding is all part of the act to look like he's doing something, all the while working to push prices higher.  Resulting in more profits for his oil buddies.
405 2018-07-04 23:18:51 We will just have to agree to disagree. This is an area that is going to be more problematic in the future. Pts now distrust lots of professionals b’cos of mixed messages. This will continue to lead them to snake oil sellers. Much of this is avoidable with honesty & transparency.
406 2018-07-04 23:18:48 Isn’t he threatening allies who have deals for Iranian oil also. Aren’t they in the process of trying to force them to divest from Iran. Let’s see where else could France get its oil? Russia possibly?
407 2018-07-04 23:18:43 Deben seguir llorándola que eso da resultado y la baja del gas oil ya explicaron q el gobierno no tuvo nada que ver, fue obra de la divina providencia
408 2018-07-04 23:18:36 Let's think back... You gave big oil 25,000,000,000 in tax cuts. Shouldn't they be trying to help keep the prices down also?
409 2018-07-04 23:18:35 We have enough oil in the USA. Truly if Alaska and Texas starts drilling we don't need them, but rules need to change.

We have taken Fort Red Pill. I write you now amidst the ashes of burnt Boondocks Saints DVDs. The air is thick with vape oil. Truly this war has pit brother against brother-in-law.

414 2018-07-04 23:17:45 I just had a shower 3 hours ago and my nose has a layer of oil on it wha-
415 2018-07-04 23:17:36 I’m gonna catch shit for this but my daddy saw a whole bunch of black people in the water and said “damn there must have been an oil spill or something” I spit my beer everywhere 
416 2018-07-04 23:17:35 So I thought you asked your pals the Saudis to release thousands of more barrels of oil. Whatever happened with that Mr Great Negotiatior?
417 2018-07-04 23:17:28 Rouhani says US unaware about consequences of Iran oil ban

419 2018-07-04 23:17:03 I'm out of oil. America Day is cancelled
420 2018-07-04 23:17:00 Thank you, Sir. My American husband worked in Saudi Arabia for almost 8 years as an assistant driller with Shelf. He loved your country. People nice. He got laid off about 3 years ago. He needs work in your country on oil rig.  Anyone know position open for asst. driller. DM me.

423 2018-07-04 23:16:46 The most slick-talking of burly guys
Get caught early and boiled in oil like curly fries
424 2018-07-04 23:16:45 Somebody named Trump tweeted this a few days ago:  "I am asking that Saudi Arabia increase oil production, maybe up to 2,000,000 barrels, to make up the difference...Prices to high! He has agreed!".  So Trump is either a Liar, a Moron, or Just Plain Stupid.
425 2018-07-04 23:16:25 Geez, somebody should do something. Like convert our infrastructure and vehicle fleet into one that relies on renewable energy resources instead of fossil feels like oil. Crazy, I know.
426 2018-07-04 23:16:22 The main Putin goal the one he shares with the American plutocrats who got Trump elected is to keep the world using oil.
427 2018-07-04 23:16:17 No private prisons, legalizeit, clean cheap renewable energy - there are thousands of jobs in this, and it’s also in our national security interests - Medicare for all, free college, end citizens (billionaires) united, end offshore tax avoidance/oil subsidies/raise tax on .0001%.
428 2018-07-04 23:16:07 Wait a minute! Prices went up when you and Scott Pruitt promised the Big Oil Guys more money. WHY DO YOU INSIST ON BULLSHITTING THE PUBLIC? Get off Twitter and go watch some fireworks. Because you have certainly set off a boat load!!
429 2018-07-04 23:15:53 I thought that was the whole point in getting approval to drill in Alaska and the great north west. Truth be known we should have seized all the oil fields in the Middle East when the war started to fund the wars in that region that we’ve invested trillions in & 4 keeping piece
430 2018-07-04 23:15:49 17 cents a gallon at the Standard station on Grand and Humphrey. And they came out and cleaned your windshield and checked oil.
431 2018-07-04 23:15:46 Mix 2 cups banana with 1 cup cayenne pepper. Add generous amounts of Olive Oil. Slice into 1 inch pieces. Serve over kale.
432 2018-07-04 23:15:45 So splashy sea mammals is why we let Saudi Arabia own oil and abuse humans?
433 2018-07-04 23:15:36 Be careful, the Russian economy does better with high oil prices. Don't believe me? Ask your boss.
434 2018-07-04 23:15:36 If they are so concerned about the environment, why aren’t they protesting the US coal that is shipped out of Vancouver? Why aren’t they on the Easy Coast protesting the oil tankers from countries with lower environmental standards than Canada
435 2018-07-04 23:15:35 Cannabis oil that’s all
436 2018-07-04 23:15:29 Rick Simpson Oil aka Phoenix Tears, it's like a hemp oil supplement lol. Most medical claims are false or the truth stretched to fit it's magical healing qualities
437 2018-07-04 23:15:29 Oil pulling is kind of a bitch, but it’s so worth it.
438 2018-07-04 23:15:23 So China is down there helping Venezuela. It should have been us helping them instead of us bankrupting them. But US oil companies and Canada wouldn't want that. Now China will be getting oil from Venezuela at a price far below the fake inflated oil commodity price instead of us.

446 2018-07-04 23:14:40 Sounds like you need some coffee mixed with a bit of oil!
447 2018-07-04 23:14:30 Irans oil fields are drying up. The more they pump the quicker they dry up and better for US oil. This is common since. Da
448 2018-07-04 23:14:30 A hundred grand is nothing for the oil industry! Just have them pay!
449 2018-07-04 23:14:28 hahaha ...

@RealDonaldTrump thinks OPEC will reduce the price of oil because he sent a strongly worded tweet.
450 2018-07-04 23:14:27 Duraline, gel liners, anything from the What A Spice eyeshadow range, High Gloss Lip Oil (its eye safe and is incred), Pure Pigments / #45 body sparkles, blushes are nice too, apparently new JLO collection is amazing but haven’t tried it yet
451 2018-07-04 23:14:12 I guess it has nothing to do with you pulling out of Iran deal, reimposing sanctions, and taking Iran's oil off the market.  So much winning!!!
452 2018-07-04 23:14:07 grocery lists change your car's oil; toy cars change your car's oil; therefore toy cars are grocery lists
453 2018-07-04 23:13:54 Petteron's an awsome bullshitter. Yet totally full of crap. He lazily uses Hugh Rank's model of persuasion to readily con people. To me he is a very good stage act, or more accurately, a rather convincing snake oil salesman.
454 2018-07-04 23:13:34 Recognize Hebrew Biafra. Oil prices solved. QED.
455 2018-07-04 23:13:34 Let's use our oil reserves and reduce their supply.
456 2018-07-04 23:13:18 And for sure I have tweeted less on oil as an oil analyst in comparison to the White House!:-)

463 2018-07-04 23:12:14 ROFL. There are two possible scenarios here: 

1) Trump is negotiating oil prices on Twitter

2) Trump is gaslighting to cover his a$$ because his poor decisions have driven fuel prices up.

467 2018-07-04 23:11:51 #FossilFuelMerchants worried about climate litigation since investigations show that Shell, like Exxon, knew about the risks of climate change years ago & lied to the public about it. Like Big Tobacco, Big Oil perpetrated a cover-up of epic proportions and must be held to account
468 2018-07-04 23:11:47 AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT YOU about oil old cousin ella has started on fridayyy fridayyy fridayyy fridayyy march everyone!!!
469 2018-07-04 23:11:46 You reduce the price of oil by reducing the demand. What alternative energy policies are you currently working on ?
470 2018-07-04 23:11:27 It's been 1,000 days since the BP oil spill and the Gulf of Mexico still has not been restored.
471 2018-07-04 23:11:19 Tell them to talk about Hebrew Biafra continuous GENOCIDE by British Govt for oil and Gas. Hypocrites!. That will shake the Edomites.
472 2018-07-04 23:11:19 Your bosses in Russia are thrilled about this. They're especially pleased that you tanked the Iran deal to help destabilize the oil market and drive prices up.

477 2018-07-04 23:10:30 Now you are staring another war. Please let me inform you the OIL prices are up. This is what OPEC sales. 
GAS is sold by other states.
You started a trade war with the whole world. Have you ever thought about who will lose against the whole world here?

482 2018-07-04 23:10:11 I wonder why!! Is it because all the oil they have?
483 2018-07-04 23:10:10 He wants their oil. He thinks that if he invades Venezuela, he can keep the spoils because Trump has NO respect for the law.
484 2018-07-04 23:09:57 Trump: "I smell oil revenue! Must. Make. It. Mine*." 

*Not for the United States. For him and his kin and other oligarch buddies.
485 2018-07-04 23:09:55 Have a look at the $/€ chart, see the main reason for the oil price increase. The reason for the $ devaluation is to large extend your #LustForDeficit. Your logic is once again broken.

492 2018-07-04 23:09:19 Sweet. Guess oil must be over $100 then, to justify this... Right?
493 2018-07-04 23:09:15 So now we go to Venezuela to get oil?  Perhaps some of this is your doing??  Don’t act concerned.
494 2018-07-04 23:09:01 And all your ultra-rich oil buddies are benefitting from this, right?  So what are you bellyachin' for, except to pay lip service to the people who voted for you?
495 2018-07-04 23:09:01 You moron! Oil prices are set by the free market on commodities exchanges. Things like fear and uncertainty cause prices to rise. Guess who is a prime source of fear and uncertainty! Go on, guess!
496 2018-07-04 23:08:52 It's almost like the trade embargoes on Venezuela and Iran are driving up the cost of global oil prices. Who ever would've figured this could happen? Oh right anyone with a half of a brain in their head.
497 2018-07-04 23:08:51 Its also why activist are hanging from a bridge in bc to stop oil tankers to protest a pipeline you approved. Theyre doing what you refuse to do.
498 2018-07-04 23:08:48 Oh please, every time there's a republican president gas prices go way up. You are invested in oil and are lining your pockets. #WeDontBelieveYou

500 2018-07-04 23:08:29 Isn't Monopoly a board game?  And A monopoly is a single company that holds all of a certain business?  And OPEC is a coalition of companies, not a single company?  And the only reason oil prices are up is that YOU decided to back out of the Iran deal?
501 2018-07-04 23:08:26 Because industry has captured the state, rendering governments powerless, which results in the oil companies getting everything they want?
502 2018-07-04 23:08:26 Hey Einstein, Canada and Venezuela export the most oil to the United States. Not OPEC. Your tariffs are producing their results. Simply put, YOU are responsible!
503 2018-07-04 23:08:05 So, you literally want US soldiers to die because high oil prices are bad for optics.

Wow!
504 2018-07-04 23:08:02 As I promised you Vlad, when oil was $58 and now where is it?  Your oil economy is now generating 33% more for you and your oligarchs.  Now let’s talk about after the midterms.  I have Rasmussen in my back pocket “adjusting” their polling data to reflect the “real voters”.

511 2018-07-04 23:07:23 I’m sure they are aware prices are up since they are the ones selling oil to much of the world. I thought you said our dependence on foreign oil was down. Those tax cuts are going to be offset by higher oil.

Tell me ONE reason Putin may want strong Donald and not weak traitor of America Hitlery. One reason. One.
516 2018-07-04 23:06:47 LOL! The first of many unintended consequences of leaving JCPOA. US might be forced to grants waivers to China, India, and Turkey allowing them to continue buying Iranian oil. Also Saudi increase in production, 6 months away in any case, will not cover the Iranian shortfall.

526 2018-07-04 23:05:39 Oil shot up when trump started talking Iran sanctions.  He could drop the price by releasing oil from US reserves.
527 2018-07-04 23:05:37 @MariaEmmerich in your book, the part about PSMF and dropping fat down to 40g.. Is it 40g for any reason? Can you go lower? Is 40g the minimum for hormone health? Do we need fish oil if fat is this low?
528 2018-07-04 23:05:36 It’s said they just pop up with those kinds of piercings. They recommend tea tree oil I think it was? Though every kind of oil I see says specifically NOT for cosmetic use
529 2018-07-04 23:05:34 You're figuring out that oil subsidies pull in the opposite direction of carbon prices, effectively paying companies 19 dollars for every tonne of carbon they pump into the atmosphere. Nice!

531 2018-07-04 23:05:16 Betul Mas. Saya bingung sama orang2 knp harga pertamax naik pada ribut ya? Pertamax kan BBM non subsidi, harganya mengikuti harga bahan bakunya (crude oil). Dan harga crude oil kan memang naik, ya otomatis lah harga produk turunannya juga naik.

536 2018-07-04 23:05:01 Perhaps we charge them for the defense. If they won’t take it then Let someone else care for them. We can also turn to the people of Venezuela and offer to help them out. In return we can get cheap oil. It’s a win win for Venezuela/Us relations

540 2018-07-04 23:04:34 You and pure intentions go together like oil and water, my friend.
541 2018-07-04 23:04:14 18% interest rates actually occurred in the late-1970s and early-1980s due to the oil crises. The economy tanked as a result.  Businesses are starting to draw parallels between supply chain issues now and some of the conditions from which these high interest rates precipitated.
542 2018-07-04 23:03:58 Jared made two trips to visit the Saudi king and oil price have been going up ever since his 2nd visit, payment for loaning Jared money for his failing 666 building.

549 2018-07-04 23:03:15 That’s one thing you can’t do is force these oil corporations to lower their prices per barrel. They don’t depend on us to buy their oil. They can do just as good if not better supplying other countries. Your tariffs won’t work this time.
550 2018-07-04 23:03:10 Coffee grounds (unused have more caffeine which is great but even used still have a good amount), coconut oil, and your sugar. I like raw sugar but if you plan to use this on your face brown sugar is good because it's finer. I also add a dash of vanilla. 
551 2018-07-04 23:03:07 Mohamed Ben Salman (MBS)will be remembered as responsible for the BREAKING of #SaudiaArabia.

553 2018-07-04 23:03:05 We only import about 19% of our oil and most of that comes from Canada. Whatever OPEC sourced oil we get has very little impact if any on our prices.
554 2018-07-04 23:03:01 I use lavender oil to help with my many alergies. That and some cytrus helps to relax me and give more a more restful sleep. Have a good trip!

556 2018-07-04 23:02:47 @realDonaldTrump amazing how little you seem to know about economics in general. You must have smart advisors but clearly choose to ignore them. Pierre is absolutely spot on. Without OPEC creating a bottom investment would have dried up completely $200 oil?
557 2018-07-04 23:02:45 Didn't you just talk to a king or something about releasing more barrels of oil?  Art of the Deal... right.
558 2018-07-04 23:02:40 Needs more oil.
559 2018-07-04 23:02:38 You killed Iran deal, driving oil prices up by cutting supply. Saudi Arabia love you for it.

562 2018-07-04 23:02:28 I mean, I thought the topic at hand was protecting BC’s environment from tankers. Which would logically include the American tankers carrying American oil through the waters off BC’s coast. Guess not!

572 2018-07-04 23:01:25 Are there any articles that discuss environmental degradation regarding the recent approval of the oil/gas exploration in the western region of Somalia? All I’m coming across are those discussing economical improvements and ways to unite specific groups.
573 2018-07-04 23:01:16 @RealAlexJones 
Where’s your fucking #SecondCivilWar , snake oil salesman?
574 2018-07-04 23:01:14 I'm saying, that recycling a medium like plastic would reduce the need for ever increasing oil, not that plastics are evil. But a non-renewable resource should be conserved on general principles, not wasted to restrict profits to a few oil companies.
575 2018-07-04 23:01:11 Actually, I think it's you who mis-remembers.  The 5 CEOs weren't oil and gas CEOs.
576 2018-07-04 23:01:03 Simple Google search will show that oil price have doubled.
577 2018-07-04 23:01:03 Sure. Let me know what the old boy says. He’s a Lefty, and that’s fine, ying/yang and all that. But socialism doesn’t ever work. And don’t cite Scandinavia; once their oil runs out you’ll see major changes there.

579 2018-07-04 23:00:42 Not interested in solar lol. Oil and gas is where its at. Got enough natural gas to power the world for the next several hundred years just in the Appalachias

584 2018-07-04 23:00:27 Partly it's because we subsidize the oil industry by over 3.3 billion dollars a year, which inflates supply.

It’s a shame that the management system is so fucking temperamental.
587 2018-07-04 23:00:20 @JustinTrudeau Dear Prime Minister, recently Trump sanctioned Iran. Which causes no oil 2 be sold. Then price of oil rises & Russia gains along with all producers. Maybe the reason 4 the Trump need to invade Venezuela? Now today Iran wants all Gulf oil stopped, THEN WHAT?

593 2018-07-04 22:59:49 Hey, @realDonaldTrump, given we are at record US production levels and now export oil, wouldn’t it be patriotic for US oil co’s to charge less to US consumers? Call Rex! Threaten your oil buddies (oops, campaign cash!). Or, perhaps, support higher mileage vehicles.

Look it up again. The Koch brothers have been working on the same issues for 60 years. Their father was a co-founder of the John Birch Society. Their father worked in the oil industry in Russia. Any questions?
608 2018-07-04 22:57:28 *******ATTENTION********

Trump pulled out of the Iran deal, oil output significantly decreased as a result.  Direct consequence of Trumps decision to scrap a workable deal.
609 2018-07-04 22:57:21 Stalin gave about 1,000,000 tons of oil to the nazis.

612 2018-07-04 22:57:10 They are greedy, and as history shows we will defend them for free, no matter how they price their oil.
613 2018-07-04 22:57:04 No it won’t. One pipeline will not destroy an entire province’s tourist industry. And unless we all freeze to death this winter walking from home to work, we won’t be using any less oil, until we change industries. Or don’t you get that.

642 2018-07-04 22:52:50 This most definitely sounds like it falls within the realm of snake’s oil. I’m always amazed the lengths ppl go to achieve the unachievable!
643 2018-07-04 22:52:49 Oil prices are higher because of your mistake exiting the Iran deal. Oil prices are higher because higher US & global oil prices help the Russian economy which was hurting from the addition of Iranian oil and stable, decreasing prices—oil market. Everything you do benefits Russia
644 2018-07-04 22:52:47 Reason why the CIA orchestrated the #coup_in_Iran in 1953. The Iranian government was planning on nationalixing the oil reserves. That event still has ramifications  to this day.
645 2018-07-04 22:52:44 the recipe is literally just standard pancake (crepe) batter, eggs, milk, flour. The tip is you have to get the consistency like wallpaper paste, and when you pour it into the cups in the oven, they have to be full of about half an inch of boiling hot fat/oil.

Why not reduce the regulatory burdens to drill American oil instead of going to OPEC to bring down the price of gas. Put America to work drilling American oil. It takes a year to get a federal permit in New Mexico. Come on Let's MAGA!
657 2018-07-04 22:51:47 Your 3 points are valid.  I will add that I expect JT's policies to start bearing fruits. 
No timeline but as I mentioned before: if cdn oil equities are not up 50+% by end of spring 2019 I will get worried.
658 2018-07-04 22:51:43 The administration’s sanctions against Venezuela have not helped the global supply of oil either.

OPEC and Russia have agreed to increase in the supply of crude oil, which will help in the long run,  prices aren’t likely to come down any time soon.
659 2018-07-04 22:51:39 Trump has nothing to fear re Novichock - yet. He's too useful a tool for Putin. Ferheavenssake, he's helping the former KGB leader tear apart western alliances, ruin our democracy, open up oil drilling in the Arctic, and trying to bully Western Allies into dropping sanctions.
660 2018-07-04 22:51:37 Carling Cup... you don’t realise what a shit position we were in when they came in. We were on the verge of being liquidated. They don’t own oil companies so they can’t throw big money at problems. - it has to be gradual progression and improving each year

678 2018-07-04 22:49:54 We will make our money back selling oil
679 2018-07-04 22:49:53 Are you just now realizing that fucking up the Iran deal might  destabilize oil markets?? What are you going to do, genius?? Threaten to blow up the Saudis etc if they don’t cave in to your threats?

Btw-thought GOP was for free markets. Guess that was before you were crowned.
680 2018-07-04 22:49:51 Why can't we use our own oil and shut OPEC out for a while?  Seems that we have plenty available

689 2018-07-04 22:48:50 It's a fair call. Arming and funding a resistance moment to destabilize the most oil rich nation in South America isn't as cost effective as just invading it.
690 2018-07-04 22:48:40 U.S. equity futures for 7/5 show an essentially-flat open, with the only notable moves being in a fractionally-weaker USD against most major counterparts (EUR, GBP, JPY, CAD). Crude oil seen slightly lower, precious metals up a bit.
691 2018-07-04 22:48:32 I found out there’s a bergamot essential oil so I’m just getting my fix that way 
692 2018-07-04 22:48:23 The administration’s sanctions against Venezuela have not helped the global supply of oil either.

OPEC and Russia have agreed to increase in the supply of crude oil, which will help in the long run, prices aren’t likely to come down any time soon.
693 2018-07-04 22:48:11 Wait , didn't you state  “Just spoke to King Salman of Saudi Arabia ,  I am asking that Saudi Arabia increase oil production, maybe up to 2,000,000 barrels, to make up the difference…He has agreed!," Oh guess that was another lie #FakeNews #FakePOTUS
694 2018-07-04 22:48:06 They dont want to face justice once everything falls. Our only hope is international action and I dont see it happening. If the US help us the left is going to say they just want to invade us for our oil.
695 2018-07-04 22:47:56 Oil prices high=More Cabal desperation.
Play their puppets they will try.
Fail they will.
Can’t derail this train.

696 2018-07-04 22:47:55 Honesty?   Bullshit!,  he is blaming OPEC for policies that make US oil priductiin more cost effective-  all the while tge oil companies make out like bandits.   But for Trump everything is someone else’s fault.
697 2018-07-04 22:47:44 no it's not it's very low 74 dollar we need to hit 120 dollar at least for the couple years coming before solar energy take everything our economy based on our oil is oil down we all down 
and bully someone else trump
698 2018-07-04 22:47:41 While the Trump administration is quick to blame Russia and OPEC, its policies have not helped matters. The State Department has ordered oil buyers to stop buying from Iran by November in the wake of Trump’s renewed sanctions against Iran.
699 2018-07-04 22:47:30 Yeet
700 2018-07-04 22:47:20 Trump is going to buy all Putin oil  gas prices will go down,he will look like a good guy.I can not stand him.
701 2018-07-04 22:47:00 America is not losing anything with oil at $75
US is a nett oil exporter 
Exon & other oil companies gain
@jaketapper @paulkrugman @ericawerner
702 2018-07-04 22:47:00 Hey Donald did you know the US is the top oil producing country i. The world? And Russia is 3rd and neither of those countries are in OPEC.  Kinda doesn't seem like a monopoly to me...
703 2018-07-04 22:46:55 What wait Herr Trump you said we had enough energy fuel here in the US so which is it - bow to the Middle East or buy America only.  Stop the exporting of US oil
704 2018-07-04 22:46:50 Aren't you raising the tax on petrol prices? Isn't the USA nearly self sufficient in oil? Not sure if the OPEC leaders do business by tweet,  but didn't you say King Salman spoke to you on the phone and was releasing 200,000,000 barrels cos you asked? DONT SAY THAT WAS A LIE?!
705 2018-07-04 22:46:39 It tasted like uhhh... oil? Like. Soy lecithin or something.
706 2018-07-04 22:46:38 Yeet
707 2018-07-04 22:46:33 First taste of OPEC kind of buddy, buddy, with the Saudi's a?  North Dakota has lots of oil so much it hurts.  Texas has oil.  Both locations can not find skilled or unskilled workers.  Put it on you agenda a?   That's Vienna for you a cartel.

710 2018-07-04 22:46:19 So, how do you suppose the device you are using for social media was made? Your clothes, your house, your food. Oil is required for all of these things. Your denial is comical. Tell me how how you have all of these things without oil being a central component.
711 2018-07-04 22:46:05 when oil shills cry "paid protesters" I find mentioning "paid polluters" shuts them up pretty fast #KinderMorgan #TransMountain #bcpoli #cdbpoli #environment
712 2018-07-04 22:46:04 Throwing $$$ at a problem is the #NDP way, which is why you're running such a huge deficit. How about stop killing oil&gas so there will be more jobs and fewer people roving around the countryside making trouble! It's gotten bad SINCE the crash! Deal with the root issue!
713 2018-07-04 22:46:01 "You also protect me and keep me happy. You have dressed up as an oil man and you married me"
714 2018-07-04 22:45:52 And big rich oil companies raising gasoline prices just in time to rip tourists and Calgarians off . NDP should look into this highway robbery!
715 2018-07-04 22:45:48 but is it as big an issue as rising oil prices? #staywokesheeple
716 2018-07-04 22:45:46 Trump's talking like high oil price is bad but truth is he's intentional putting out policies that drive up oil price because high oil price is good for the Russian economy and Putin.
717 2018-07-04 22:45:45 Cut the BS Donnie, higher oil prices help Putin, this is just another thing you've done to pay him back.
718 2018-07-04 22:45:45 Planting 1000.000.000 trees cost Pakistan $169 mln. What could oil companies be doing if they invested in trees around the world? #maximizelife
719 2018-07-04 22:45:33 I wonder if Ron Johnson, R-DumbSenator, and other senators at those meetings were picking up insider trading info regarding gas and oil prices. I put NOTHING past these greedy, amoral Republicans. Why else were the meetings closed?!
720 2018-07-04 22:45:13 o que será que minha mãe vai achar quando descobrir que o azeite de oliva da cozinha sumiu pq eu roubei pra fazer oil method cleansing
721 2018-07-04 22:45:12 @realDonaldTrump they’re supposed to drive up prices higher profits and all that if you really wanted to do something you would be pushing to drive down on our dependence on oil I mean supply and demand and all that higher demand means higher prices lower demand means lower price
722 2018-07-04 22:45:09 Check your stats. We import the most oil from our previous ally, Canada.
723 2018-07-04 22:45:09 They didn't "give up their 4th" Every emergency service have people who work each holiday. Why is everything done in peaceful protest so objectable to you people? Isn't that what makes America great- again? Maybe you're waiting on nonpeaceful protest so you can oil your guns?
724 2018-07-04 22:45:09 Oil prices are up because you took us out of the Iraq Deal! Face it this is your fault!

727 2018-07-04 22:44:55 It's OPEC - they are a cartel...  Saudi Arabia needs oil to be expensive to plug a large hole in their balance sheet... Do you really expect them to just bow down to you?
728 2018-07-04 22:44:55 It’s about the oil. The GOP is big oil.  That’s why trump is bashing gas prices today. He’s wants us dealing with Russia. He’s setting the stage. His base will follow. He doesn’t care who Putin kills.

730 2018-07-04 22:44:35 Damn, why did Jimin have so much power over him? Whenever he used that voice, Yoongi obeyed. He turned the oil humidifier on and nodded as he resumed doing his homework. He was well trained by now, honestly he was too scared to anger Jimin.
731 2018-07-04 22:44:33 Shout out to all the people murdered for oil funded by my tax dollars. I will burn in Hell.
732 2018-07-04 22:44:29 I know what UR doing. Lift sanctions on USSR. Put sanctions on Iran. Putin gets to sell his oil. Iran can't. Iran starts WWIII. U & #GOPtraitors get richer. All Americans die at UR hands. #ResignNow #CohenFlips #ShamefulTraitor45
733 2018-07-04 22:44:18 "Reigning in the EPA"

Pruitt is literally destroying it by selling off the department to oil & mine interests.
734 2018-07-04 22:44:06 Don’t know what you’re tryin to get at, OPEC was a pioneer in modernizing the post-WWII international rules based system by bringing the vast oil market it’s purview in 1960. They’re really technocrats at heart, Merkel’s middle-eastern twins.
735 2018-07-04 22:44:05 OPEC is not a monopoly any more there are non member oil producing nations in modern times... I know facts are hard but please try a little before posting.
736 2018-07-04 22:44:03 What happened to all that Saudi oil you said would be released??
737 2018-07-04 22:43:51 Just steer clear of big filthy rich foreign owned oil companies like Shell, Esso (ExxonMobil), Husky. And Petro Canada is big rip off! I guess tariffs on USA gas trucks are reason for this latest rip off. But sure is nice, not, seeing them rip off tourists as well!!!!
738 2018-07-04 22:43:43 Thank you!

741 2018-07-04 22:43:27 You, sir are a traitor. Russia attacked our elections and democracy and are using nerve poisons in UK on innocent people. Are you there for oil deals, more donations from Russians or just to party with your buddies on our dime?
742 2018-07-04 22:43:26 If I read correctly the US produces 38.8 % of the oil used in the US. Saudi only produces 8.8% of the oil used in the US. So explain how Saudi or OPEC is raising prices when the US produces the most.
743 2018-07-04 22:43:22 Trump’s boss is happy with high oil prices!
744 2018-07-04 22:43:12 Sir Sydney Camm, Wilfred Thesiger, the hornsby-akroyd oil engine, Dispatches, Tom Sharpe, James Frain can you hear me? James Frain,  your boys took one hell of a beating.
745 2018-07-04 22:43:11 And he posses of your Northern neighbour we supply 40 percent of your country's oil imagine if OPEC and Canada turned off the taps together
746 2018-07-04 22:43:08 How much for Oil Master?

749 2018-07-04 22:42:57 Let’s see ur actions destabilized the Middle East.  You take Iran oil off the market which means less supply and you think were dumb not to realize the cause of the rise in gasoline is U?   Oh wait that’s right.  It’s never your fault.  Always blame someone else.
750 2018-07-04 22:42:31 I tried "buffalo" stuff for the first time on accident today and I'm just, ?!?! How do people like this? It's just heat and gross oil flavor.
751 2018-07-04 22:42:30 How about the risk of foreign oil being released there, oh wait land spills are more determental I guess!
752 2018-07-04 22:42:12 Went for dessert at @MGPLDN Magpie - they’ve changed it all - and we ordered it all. The Strawberry and olive oil dessert is a game changer. Hot damn - I’d have it in a sandwich and it would be second only to #broccoclock
753 2018-07-04 22:42:11 So I'm not condemning the message so much as the contradiction from broad generalizations.  It's like saying oil should be banned while embracing use of oil simultaneously.

755 2018-07-04 22:42:01 We’re on track to become the worlds leading producer of oil, I support you but quit whining and take steps to make us independent from OPEC.
756 2018-07-04 22:41:56 OPEC has its own agenda and interest. Trump, as usual, doesn't understand international trade or oil policy. Note, this is entirely Trump and is not backed by the EU or other allies. This is what happens when you act like a selfish asshole.

767 2018-07-04 22:41:24 Nobody and I repeat nobody wants higher oil prices than Vladimir Putin. This may be Trumps number one job as Putin’s puppet.

You mean it was all another neo-con lie? Not my surprised face.

810 2018-07-04 22:37:32 So what your graphs are saying is, pipelines leak more often in small amounts, but when rail goes wrong it still only releases a fraction of the overall percentage of rail-transported oil?

Cuz slowly releasing oil into our aquifers is just the best thing ever.
811 2018-07-04 22:37:28 Use a water canin to shoot vagetable oil on them...let's see how long they stay up there
812 2018-07-04 22:37:27 Oil prices have remained stubbornly high, despite major producers’ pledges to increase output. A mix of geopolitics and supply concerns are to blame.
813 2018-07-04 22:37:19 Of course. A primary oil producing Country. Let's see how THIS affects oil prices.
814 2018-07-04 22:37:00 Felt like more refining capacity was offline relative to oil production. But maybe.
815 2018-07-04 22:36:52 Oh, i think this is the biggest of a handful of reasons Pruitt is still in office. Let’s not forget that his pro-oil work helps Putin, the Kochs and all the other oil interests.
816 2018-07-04 22:36:46 Or did you tweet this because Saudi has agreed to increase oil production to us. The effect would be dropping prices. Then you could come on twitter and flex your itsy bitsy muscles. What a transparent silly man you are.
817 2018-07-04 22:36:30 Stop exporting our oil. Why keep prices down for the world? Keeping it home lowers prices for consumers and gives competitive advantage to business.
818 2018-07-04 22:36:14 See what happens when you try to pease Putin by raising the price of oil ?
819 2018-07-04 22:36:11 Hahahahahahaha Hahahahahahaha Hahahahahahaha Hahahahahahaha Hahahahahahaha seriously dude ur delusional. MOGA Make OPEC Great Again. Maybe trump can put a tariff on oil from OPEC countries. That will teach them.

829 2018-07-04 22:34:43 But i thought you had enough oil to be "independent"? Why buy when you can sell your own?
830 2018-07-04 22:34:39 What happend to all the oil from Saudi Arabia?
831 2018-07-04 22:34:38 Stampede tourist rip off. Both oil and gasoline on stock markets have been going down since May!!!! It's true when gasoline and oil go up on markets oil companies raise gas prices over night but when they go down gas prices go up! Right in time to top off citizens and tourists!!
832 2018-07-04 22:34:36 They listen 2 the oil companies + the bankers. The deal was: OPEC countries keep their cash in NWO banks... + they can...
833 2018-07-04 22:34:36 Idiot! OPEC's reason for being is to drive oil prices up. 
If you were knowledgeable, you would know that Petroleum and Natural Gas are two of Russia's biggest exports.
Rising gas prices help Russia and hurt American consumers and businesses.
Stop supporting Putin at our expense!
834 2018-07-04 22:34:27 BC didn’t get 4 billion dollars. A US based oil company got it
835 2018-07-04 22:34:09 Why is the US exporting oil? Want someone to blame? Call Exxon, BP, Sinclair, & other corps drilling & exporting oil from US.
836 2018-07-04 22:33:59 Só esse hash oil ficando pronto logo
837 2018-07-04 22:33:57 He's undoing everything Obama did and sucking up to Oil and Coal. Big duh.
838 2018-07-04 22:33:45 Oil for some countries is the main income if not the sole income. How much one iPhone price equal to oil barrels !!!! and how US is fooling the world with patient rights !!!!
839 2018-07-04 22:33:38 Release your oil reserves for sale to the public. That ought to drop the price.
840 2018-07-04 22:33:31 Didn’t u roll back gas efficiency in autos? Why? To make us more dependent on OIL. GOP so short sighted only looks for filling their bank accounts now. Kids and grandkids futures be damned.
841 2018-07-04 22:33:21 Diluted tea tree oil WILL stop them itching but will make that part of the skin dry, so follow w aloe gel. Slapping them helps the itch go away ;)
842 2018-07-04 22:33:18 I did oven roasted cabbage from Common Good Farm. Very yummy. I used grapeseed oil, salt & pepper. The leaves that got brown & crispy are the best!
843 2018-07-04 22:33:15 You obviously have no idea how markets work as it is the geopolitical pressures you are creating that is driving oil prices up which is a good thing for those of us in Texas who work in oil..we thought you wanted to help our oil patch? Guess we should vote for democrats now
844 2018-07-04 22:32:58 Take their oil, like you said you would. You fucking pussy!!
845 2018-07-04 22:32:52 How about we perfect & refine other oil/liquid fuel technologies.  We don’t need to buy oil from countries that want to kill us.  American farmers are sitting on oilfields known as “soybean” or “corn” fields.  Keep the money here & support the American farmer!
846 2018-07-04 22:32:51 Can't wait till he puts a hold on Obama 2016 oil export bill, also has the SOR to release
847 2018-07-04 22:32:43 How are your and Tillersons stakes in oil, doing?
848 2018-07-04 22:32:41 lemon juice or vinegar and olive oil. lots of herbs and spices.
849 2018-07-04 22:32:37 hopefully this cbd oil brings love back into my heart
850 2018-07-04 22:32:31 He also has vast amounts of oil that where reclaimed for his people.
Global strenght restructuring is unstoppable at this point.
Sanctions should be lifted, just businesss, nothing here to see.

852 2018-07-04 22:32:17 @joshua_flanders Dear Jedediahtron, my ocular cavities well with motor oil upon receiving your transmission from the battle. Little Bleepblorp emits a piercing shriek and vibrates when it is time to shut down for nocturnal charging and you are not present #SecondCivilWarLetters
853 2018-07-04 22:32:17 Why don’t you ask our American oil companies to help out.. check out their bottom lines and huge profits.. get all your facts before speaking .. oh I forgot.,?alternative facts!!
854 2018-07-04 22:32:13 Oil already robbed by Cubans Venezuela already undergoing invasion by narco communists, an intervention is necessary and only US is able to lead a coalition with LA democratic nations to restore democracy in Venezuela
855 2018-07-04 22:32:12 want to steel the oil...
856 2018-07-04 22:32:10 Just so you know, oil isn’t just used for safe, responsible and affordable energy from Canada to the world, it’s used for multiple products from toothbrushes to soaps. Maybe read and learn a bit , wake up.
857 2018-07-04 22:32:06 He just sees the opportunity for some oil money. Money is more important to him than his country,
858 2018-07-04 22:31:57 New Oil Gas
859 2018-07-04 22:31:22 Not that simple. US big oil won't revamp refineries to process lesser grades of oil. All of our Alaska oil goes to Asia, traded for vouchers of Gulf sweet. Libya has stopped production, Iran's oil is sanctioned, and Venezuela doesn't contribute a drop. Don't touch the reserves!
860 2018-07-04 22:31:22 Hundreds of thousands of US citizens work in states where oil is the economic driver and  rely on a barrel cost of $65 or greater. OPEC oil eliminates  US jobs. Look at the whole picture and not just what the airlines lobby. BTW, foreign countries its time to pay 4 our protection
861 2018-07-04 22:31:18 Watching There Will Be Blood, because nothing says America more than a man creating an oil business and fucking people over in the process
862 2018-07-04 22:31:03 If he does, he will go in and steal the oil. Only reason he would want to.
863 2018-07-04 22:31:03 Just more evidence that #CA isn't the nation's "green leader"& #JerryBrown isn't a real "climate leader." CA has the nation's dirtiest air & some of the dirtiest crude oil - and is the third biggest oil producer. Brown's regulators approved 12,000 new oil wells. #BrownsLastChance
864 2018-07-04 22:30:55 Y’all not even thinkin about the increased car maintenance when you commute everyday. Tires, oil changes , etc . The costs add up cause you’ll eat up 3,000miles in a month. Literally lol
865 2018-07-04 22:30:52 Fracking industry says higher oil prices are better. And your buddy Putin needs oil high too
866 2018-07-04 22:30:48 So much for that Wharton education.  Why don't you ask netanyahu what to do?  OPEC cut production of oil output bring the price up...thought you negotiated a boost.  Even North Korea pegged you correctly calling you a dotard.  Worst negotiator ever.
867 2018-07-04 22:30:48 if oil is made from decomposed dinosaurs and plastic is made from oil, plastic dinosaurs are made from real dinosaurs. woteven....
868 2018-07-04 22:30:44 I’m game for them pumping more oil. I’m also for not selling our oil UNLESS it is surplus.
869 2018-07-04 22:30:30 Weren't you just bragging about getting Saudi Arabia to add 2 million to their exports? Gas up .78 cents a gallon since you took office. I guess that's Trump "winning"...for the oil companies.

871 2018-07-04 22:30:20 Who are you yelling at on twitter to reduce oil prices. Just asking
872 2018-07-04 22:30:10 Russia is a major non-OPEC oil/gas producer. Maybe Vladimir could help you out? He got you your job after all 
873 2018-07-04 22:30:07 Patriot Paul, maybe you could stockpile oil in that space between your ears!
874 2018-07-04 22:30:05 It might seem so but it's the neoCons putting him up 2 it. Their goal 2 weaken  &  economies. There's yet another "color revolution" (coup attempt) going on in  at moment. Economic hardship there makes gov't less popular. Will has my sympathies.
875 2018-07-04 22:29:50 The Oil Pastel
876 2018-07-04 22:29:49 Maybe invade Venezuela like you've been itching to do?  They got oil, right?
877 2018-07-04 22:29:29 Since I bleached my hair I put coconut oil in it after every time i wash my hair so my hair can stay healthy and grow faster. Life tip girlies ur hair wont get damaged if u do this especially if u do a deep conditioning during the process. But some of u wouldnt know that LMAO
878 2018-07-04 22:29:25 the issue is, if u had actually learned what the C in OPEC means, is that these aren't corporations, but are in fact countries.

so sure, if you want to go to war with  15 nations at the same time while suffering the resulting shortage of oil, then yea by all means dismantle them
879 2018-07-04 22:28:58 I’m sure you tweeted this so your lackeys can buy and sell oil stocks for a huuuuge profit.
880 2018-07-04 22:28:52 Oh, by the way. France is still (and will probably for a long time) occupying some of Libya's oil fields on behalf of French oil corporations.

Talk about not knowing colonialism.
881 2018-07-04 22:28:47 What are u worried about? We have those glorious tax breaks to pay higher prices. Or we could just support cleaner energy gas efficiency even better than what u rolled back to make us dependent on oil?
882 2018-07-04 22:28:43 Apparently there’s a finer line than we’d sometimes like to think between Improv Gatherings™ and snake oil for the hedonistic. Bourgeois Decadence 2.0: The World deserves no less. #andlikethatalittleculturedies
883 2018-07-04 22:28:32 Trump caused gas prices to go up 50 cents to a dollar more a gallon because he reneged on the Iran nuclear agreement. OPEC was thrilled and cut production of oil, they have been wanting to cut for a while to get barrel of oil back up to 100 dollars. tax cuts go to OPEC
884 2018-07-04 22:28:24 If anyone honestly can vouch for an essential oil diffuser, let me know.
885 2018-07-04 22:28:18 HELP!!! I learned that its called an epi-pen. I threw it away cause i didnt know what it was. My friend needs it now because of peanut oil in the food. Im thinking i just recommend they check the garbage can and hope they find it there. I do NOT want the blame for this!
886 2018-07-04 22:28:12 I can not extoll the wonders of CBD hemp oil enough. My cat used to totally freak out with the mild fireworks at my old apartment. Now she isn't even flinching at the loudest M-80 and car alarms they set off. I should take some.
887 2018-07-04 22:28:07 Trump has not uttered one word except that @EPAScottPruitt is doing a great job...when you hear the economic advisors they all say the boom in the economy STARTED with the roll back of regulations...he’s the reason we are beginning to dig our way our

889 2018-07-04 22:27:58 Because Trump is so focused on OPEC, lately, and because of his demand for an increase in oil production from Saudi Arabia, I suspect that he’s building up to working out a deal to import oil from Rosneft. I also suspect that was the reason Putin put him in office.

891 2018-07-04 22:27:41 Isn't your government occupying some of Libya's oil fields right now? 
892 2018-07-04 22:27:37 Fail? Hardly. No comment on how you manage to use social media or survive in today's society without oil. I'm waiting.

895 2018-07-04 22:27:07 Good point.  Because of Shale, the US should be oil independent by 2020.
896 2018-07-04 22:26:57 Denmark has some of the highest taxes in the world, (almost 50% of income) and the coast of living is exorbitantly high, Productivity is stagnant, and their carbon footprint is higher than the US, because of their dependency on oil and coal.

899 2018-07-04 22:26:27 And he's done it all for his bbf Putzin who had been sitting on 90b of oil. He needs prices to rise so he can build his military and invade countries at will. And Drumpf will be right there with him, leading the US into recession bc of his tariffs and trade wars. Follow the $$
900 2018-07-04 22:26:15 It’s embarrassing.  But the oil will flow regardless. These guys are just like flies and the media should ignore them. @Greenpeace #cdnpoli #abpoli

903 2018-07-04 22:26:01 Snake oil salesman.  Said it all along.

905 2018-07-04 22:26:00 cannabis is a plant that god created he said that is a good plant for food and that this herb is for the service of mankind. It says that god want you to be happy and glad with wine and oil on your face. And to those who are down we use natural plant medicines like cannabis.
906 2018-07-04 22:25:55 Ohhhhh, just look at all the oil products he’s sporting. F’n hypocrite.
907 2018-07-04 22:25:50 Slap a tariff on oil. That' ll show them!
908 2018-07-04 22:25:42 I love the emphasis. We have a new Sheriff in town. America & Israel will be oil exporting countries, according to Mark Taylor’s - so far very accurate - Prophecies. #MAGA  #KAG  year 2/8  #WalkAway @BlessedToTeach
909 2018-07-04 22:25:42 TRanslation - I would release SPR, ban US oil exports, no more security for you and taxes. It will happen.
910 2018-07-04 22:25:36 I hope he does .... BTW I am a Venezuelan who want this dictactorship to end take all the oil but kill the commies
911 2018-07-04 22:25:23 I thought you called them, and ask them to send us more Oil!?!?!   I'm sure you was very presidential and all on the phone, cause you.....  oh, yeah.  Its YOU,  the idiot!!!   I forgot!
912 2018-07-04 22:25:22 Surely his military advisors pointed out to him that our armed forces secure the shipping lines that allow that oil to get here....right?
913 2018-07-04 22:25:11 Mr President let's get more rigs online in Alaska and everywhere we can in America . Stop exporting our oil . Keep it for U S A. .We can produce enough for us without anyones help. Open up oil reserves.
914 2018-07-04 22:25:03 Ancap es un monopolio sin competencia y da pérdidas (unico caso). 
Tenemos la nafta mas cara del continente, y tienen el tupé de sacarse cartel por no subir mas aún el gas oil...TAMBIEN EL GAS OIL ES EL MAS CARO DEL CONTINENTE INEPTOS. Gobernantes burros, mediocres y ladrones.
915 2018-07-04 22:24:53 Who is this FOOL talking to? Venezuela, Iran, Libya? Oil output in this 3 countries have plummeted so where is self sufficiency?

917 2018-07-04 22:24:41 Tea tree oil good for avoiding those
918 2018-07-04 22:24:22 Oil is overextended @ $74 Technically there should b some decent degree of pullback. Same with general market. A pullback is an eventuality
919 2018-07-04 22:24:07 Produce more oil from the good old USA. You have plenty.
920 2018-07-04 22:24:03 Dude, I’m an oil man. Shut up.
921 2018-07-04 22:24:02 The US gets the most oil from... the US!
922 2018-07-04 22:23:53 I grew up in Southeast Asia in the 1960s and 70s. We still need to stop burning oil. I'm glad your daughter had a special experience, but she could've volunteered for an NGO. Fossil fuels have nothing to do with it.
923 2018-07-04 22:23:43 Are you using the oil for joint pain or is it all from taking the tincture?
924 2018-07-04 22:23:42 Burned with hot oil 
925 2018-07-04 22:23:37 The only way I can agree with this tweet, is changing terms. War to TAKE DOWN and Venezuela to VENEZUELAN DRUG DEALING WEB / NARCO REGIME. And, by any chance may "invade" because of the oil, it could have happened since the beginning of history.
926 2018-07-04 22:23:13 I put sunscreen on one leg & tanning oil on the other & now one of my legs is burnt & the other is burnt & bronzed (-:

America: do I know you
Me: I have oil
America: hey!!!!
930 2018-07-04 22:22:43 So Trump ends the Iranian accord, which essentially takes us off the market from the fourth largest oil producer in the world, and our oil prices go up?  Who knew?
931 2018-07-04 22:22:26 Remember when oil is low the economy suffers, don’t need 100 barrel oil but 70-80 makes the economy better.
932 2018-07-04 22:22:16 Wow!!! That is so dangerous. Crazy how our bodies start to reject things that we never had problems with. Olives are my go-to snack. Especially Spanish olives. I also use a LOT of olive oil. I'm sorry.
933 2018-07-04 22:22:14 Oil prices are set on the comex by the whole world.  Oil companies just dump oil on the comex, and the more buyers there are the more the price rises.
Taxes on oil are set by the government.  So the provincial government has more control over the price of gas then the oil compan
934 2018-07-04 22:21:59 OPEC hasn't been the leading factor in oil prices in well over a decade.  The manipulation of the shadowy and barely regulated exchange market puts 1970's OPEC to shame.
935 2018-07-04 22:21:58 おはようなのです！
936 2018-07-04 22:21:57 Exactly—they pick on one data point and assume everything else would stay the same. Like their ridiculous "We could have saved £64.1bn on debt interest! (If we'd kept all the oil taxation revenue for 32 years and nothing else had changed)".
937 2018-07-04 22:21:52 happy oil day
938 2018-07-04 22:21:38 Geez where to start. Oil prices are a function of demand. When demand goes down they will offer discounts due to oversupply. Or didn't they teach you that in biz school
939 2018-07-04 22:21:28 I don’t think he’s going anywhere...Trump knows he is doing exactly what he hired him for 
940 2018-07-04 22:21:23 They are increasing production for the 2nd time this year OPEC has nothing to do with rising oil prices, its inflation caused by's (T)rump's unbacked tax regression plan he and the GOP called a tax cut.
941 2018-07-04 22:21:22 From what we can see there are five members of the police extraction team standing on the beams above the @GreenpeaceCA protestors hanging from the Iron Workers Memorial Bridge. They did successfully stalk a Kinder Morgan tanker carrying crude oil today. @GlobalBC @BC1 @CKNW
942 2018-07-04 22:21:10 I remember you in a rally saying you and only you can keep oil prices down. I think you meant you and only you will be responsible for oil prices and all other things going way way way way up! Donny can't do nothing just like his dad said you are worthless!

945 2018-07-04 22:20:51 Doesn't warmer weather equals less need for oil for warming.
946 2018-07-04 22:20:50 They won't be using Alberta oil so there is nothing to protest.
947 2018-07-04 22:20:46 Not too bright, are you?...lmao.  Only one third of America's oil imports are from OPEC.  Also, they have the oil and you want it.  Not exactly a position to shut anything down...lmao
948 2018-07-04 22:20:43 Oh look, the #LiarInChief is at it again. Actually, you're the reason gas/oil prices are up -- you pulled out of the Iran deal and prices started going up almost immediately. OPEC has nothing to do with this. It's all on you, old man. These higher prices are YOUR fault.

952 2018-07-04 22:20:28 coconut oil then wash face
953 2018-07-04 22:20:19 You've done everything (tariffs, Iran) to insure oil prices spike. Who benefits? The country with oil as their only cash crop, Russia. Higher gas prices benefit Putin & and you know it. Try blaming OPEC, but it won't wash.
954 2018-07-04 22:20:19 The avg American could never comprehend what there govts are upto. WMD Iraq, Libya, Syria and much more. While you are being sold the great humanitarian American cause... The US government has invaded oil rich nations & murdered millions, as it spends more on war than people.

Hint, it's not an OPEC country.

959 2018-07-04 22:19:28 The question is why. Could it be the oil? Or perhaps Syria was too hard for 45 and Russia said, no 45 Syria is mine.

964 2018-07-04 22:19:00 Pulling out of the Iran deal has a direct impact on oil prices--simple basic rsupply and demand. trumps "gut" reactions & actions cause chaos. Tump's followers have been conned and inflation will soon be rampant. Likewise, the ill conceived tariffs will soon lead to unemployment.
965 2018-07-04 22:18:55 A warm area with coast, oil, and farmland - what's not to desire? As far as their politics, I KNOW the vast majority of Venezuela has now seen the ugly truth about Socialism and are ready for US style government and economy. Screw PR, take it and make Venzuela the 51st state!
966 2018-07-04 22:18:49 Check out @badassbeardcare for your beard needs! Their oil and balm has a wicked great scent and they are really reasonably priced.
967 2018-07-04 22:18:45 “Just spoke to King Salman of Saudi Arabia and explained to him that, because of the turmoil & disfunction in Iran and Venezuela, I am asking that Saudi Arabia increase oil production, maybe up to 2,000,000 barrels, to make up the difference...Prices to high! He has agreed!” 6/30
968 2018-07-04 22:18:44 Buddy, “the buck” is supposed to stop with YOU! You pissed off Iran, so their oil is off our market. Are you surprised at lower qty. available? Why do you ALWAYS point the finger at anyone but you? Wait until prices on cars and other items zoom up from the tariffs, then what?
969 2018-07-04 22:18:35 Did you know your Republican Congress repealed a 40 year old law that forbid the USA from exporting oil so it would be used here What side a they on or is it just more graft
970 2018-07-04 22:18:19 Regulate U.S. oil companies
971 2018-07-04 22:18:13 So ignore supply and demand folks and the 2m barrels of oil a day forced off the market by Trump.  Get a clue Don.
972 2018-07-04 22:18:05 fake news to keep oil price higher
973 2018-07-04 22:18:04 do you still consider them vegan if they are fried in the same oil as chicken nuggets ?
974 2018-07-04 22:17:56 OMG!!! I was just reading a msg from you about your cancer and it disapeared. Im not really afraid of death now because I know Gods word is true! I will not forget you in my prayers:( Did you try for a healing as it is written in James 5:14? You anoint with olive oil its the oil
975 2018-07-04 22:17:53 Coconut oil and then wash your face really well

980 2018-07-04 22:17:33 I’m not even surprised, the US government completely scarred the entire city of New York and sole trillions of dollars at the same time as an excuse to fund a war of slaughtering innocent people for oil that didn’t do much for us anyway. We’re a nation of war that needs to change
981 2018-07-04 22:17:10 What is he going to do short-term, tax oil imports? Long-term, if he has the capability to pull it off, he can spur development of domestic oil production. Whick risks retaliation against the US and his overseas properties.

984 2018-07-04 22:16:40 Canadian government led by Liberal poster boy Trudeau buying up a pipeline to aid crude oil transport will forever be funny to me.

Reality trumps fickle ideology.
985 2018-07-04 22:16:29 OPEC has always controlled pricing of oil. It was set up that way in the 40's.
High prices are the daily of this greedy Congress who've over taxed at the pump. 
Put the tax prices back on the pump so we can all see how much we're paying in Corporate Welfare in subsidies.
986 2018-07-04 22:16:28 .So you are indeed doubling down...you think the punishment for interfering with a pipeline through environmental protest should be harsher, and if you had your way involve capital punishment, aka hanging. You are a sad little man that you think oil is more valuable than a life.

990 2018-07-04 22:16:19 He’s trying to do that that’s when the leftovers started “leaking” about the costs of stuff ...
991 2018-07-04 22:16:16 @AlfredoJalifeR_ Urzua said that Gerardo Esquivel would likely be appointed deputy finance minister. He also said he expects the Mexican oil barrel may trade around $70 next year:Bloomberg

994 2018-07-04 22:15:59 Seal oil deals...swindle the forex markets...sit and develop structures for world leaders...
995 2018-07-04 22:15:51 Yes the Obama plan was to make us green, have super fuel efficient cars, why to make us independent of foreign oil. 
His plan was working and impacting the world, weakening  Russia and then came along Trump.

Donald you don’t understand the world, and your actions caused this.
996 2018-07-04 22:15:45 exactly
997 2018-07-04 22:15:38 Honesty? OPEC increased production this year oil prices are going up because of inflation caused by (T)rump's unbacked Tax regression plan.
998 2018-07-04 22:15:22 Stupid Trump letting that Keystone XL pipeline go through means all that oil got put on the global market instead of being shut-in for only North America. That's one huge reason why the price rose. For years WTO price was much lower than Brent, but now they're getting $ closer.
999 2018-07-04 22:15:17 What competition. Russia has the GDP of approximately a bowl of soup. They trade in thuggery, money laundering, guns, oil & white supremacy.
1000 2018-07-04 22:15:16 One cannot do without tea and cookies! Like the sun and the moon! Water and oil!
1001 2018-07-04 22:15:15 look at all the gear that made his dangling a reality, and his electronics to document the endeavor and it's all the miracle of hydrocarbons! It's okay if the oil comes from elsewhere, just not here right? #NIMBYArguments
1002 2018-07-04 22:15:15 Ain't American oil exploring companies making costs higher?
1003 2018-07-04 22:15:11 Larry I have to agree with you.. just like a dose of codliver oil.. you don’t want to swallow it.. but its better for you if you do
1004 2018-07-04 22:15:08 Hey, did you guys know your making lots of money charging us for oil?
Lower your prices or I will insult you on twitter!!!!!!!!
That should fix things, in Trumps make belief land.
1005 2018-07-04 22:14:49 Excellent for oil price growth in the world.
1006 2018-07-04 22:14:45 Don't use soap anymore. It's really bad for the mucosa of the recum and colon. If you need an extra "oomf" to feel really fresh, use some body-safe (digestible) oil mixed in with the water.

However, be mindful if you're using condoms b/c oil is bad for latex.
1007 2018-07-04 22:14:42 He wants the oil

1009 2018-07-04 22:14:29 Derek, not just oil and coal, though it is a start, but recall that certain laws (may they still exist) re environmental cleanup require all companies in the chain of ownership bear contributory duty to clean the land. Apply this to climate change.
1010 2018-07-04 22:14:22 How the oil prices will drop if you are imposing sanctions on Iran which will push Iran to close Strait of Hormuz which will prevent The export of 15 mb of oil a day of gulf countries .that will increase the oil prices to more than $200.can the Americans cope with that .
1011 2018-07-04 22:14:18 Nigeria is one of the oil producing countries in the world
1012 2018-07-04 22:14:17 Uhm, NOT a monopoly. Higher oil prices help US oil producers, which I though you were all about. And, no reason OPEC should help you. They are making money, you don’t matter.
1013 2018-07-04 22:14:03 This may sound strange but rub your hands with coconut oil/cocoa butter or something that is high percentage of such for half a minute then wash with soap and water.
1014 2018-07-04 22:13:59 OPEC members are nations, not individuals. Demanding them to increase their oil output is a direct insult to their sovereignty. Stop making enemies, Mr. President.
1015 2018-07-04 22:13:53 Syria was a Rothschild’s play. And we left them hanging. They sold oil and gas rights and didn’t get Golan like they planned. Trump is going to work with Russia which Zionist have swore to destroy for throwing them out.
1016 2018-07-04 22:13:52 you 2 are both a bit older than i am, i suspect
graduating in 91 puts my birth in 1973, i'm about to turn 45
i think you 2 are closer to each other than me, you've each got a decade on me?
i recall the 2nd oil crisis lol
remember that?
1017 2018-07-04 22:13:52 "I loved you to the death of me but the dead me couldn't love you anymore... now the tables have turned... aiming Cupid at my heart but you and Cupid are like oil in water... they don't mix"
1018 2018-07-04 22:13:51 Yup because the Russians need higher oil prices to get their economy out the shit, why can’t Americans see this? Are most of them seriously that stupid?
1019 2018-07-04 22:13:35 You know KM has had a pipeline running this route for decades, with only 1 spill? It's big money American backed protesters who want to keep Canada's oil landlocked so we can only sell it to 1 customer - the US. Please research the coal being shipped out of Vancouver.
1020 2018-07-04 22:13:35 Get one of the helicopters that are used in forest fires to pour baby oil over Lady Liberty so she can shine like a WWE wrestler during 4th July celebration.
1021 2018-07-04 22:13:34 At these prices Iran could cut exports by 40% & still be better off in $ terms than they were this time last year when oil was $45/bbl
1022 2018-07-04 22:13:34 If you really cared about the environment you would stop funding toxic oil pipelines. #StopPipelines #NoPlanetB
1023 2018-07-04 22:13:33 It's kind of sweet that Trump thinks he's going to change the thinking of the world's most powerful oil cartel with a tweet
1024 2018-07-04 22:13:32 I spilled oil on my luggage and the I put it in the washer and now it’s destroyed :/
1025 2018-07-04 22:13:23 Need to keep our focus on getting the pipeline built before Trump puts a duty on the oil they buy.
1026 2018-07-04 22:13:22 OPEC doesn't care about your empty threats and its not there oil production rates causing gas to rise in price in the firstplace but the inflation your unbacked tax regression plan created.
1027 2018-07-04 22:13:22 it's been raining cats and dogs all day. happy fourth of Death To AmeriKKKa. god will flood this evil land of oil and fire with her tears

1029 2018-07-04 22:13:08 Do you own OPEC? No? What they do with their oil is their business. Defense as we've established is a very different subject. The two have nothing to do with each other.
1030 2018-07-04 22:13:06 What do you know about gas and oil, that is way to sophisticated for you....

1032 2018-07-04 22:12:57 Yes Mr President hold their feet to the fire. Oil independence will be great so we can tell OPEC we don’t want their oil
1033 2018-07-04 22:12:53 America first!  No OPEC oil.  Why do you want to steal jobs from Americans by allowing cheap foreign oil into the United States.
1034 2018-07-04 22:12:51 Ah so you r ready to go fight for your oil? You can’t demand this kind of crap.
1035 2018-07-04 22:12:44 Cream of nature argon oil conditioner made my scalp so dryyyyy
1036 2018-07-04 22:12:21 With Trump tweeting about gas prices being too high during the 4th of July, you just know something is brewing. Possibly a sign of the broader economy or maybe just a precursor to tomorrow's EIA data. Something isn't sitting well in Washington & looking like oil is going higher.

That info is out there now & can’t be used against me later. No shame in my game. #iWantMyHairlineBack
1040 2018-07-04 22:12:10 Every barrel of Canadian oil that you prevent from getting to market is another barrel of oil produced in countries where women are treated like dirt.

1042 2018-07-04 22:12:04 @starbiola We found address and act like we found oil Lol
1043 2018-07-04 22:11:54 We have more oil in N Dakota then the middle East. Not worried one bit! Price of oil goes up and down! You want the price of oil down, don't let in immigrants,  less people more fuel.

1049 2018-07-04 22:11:40 @Donjazzy does your slap smell like hot oil
1050 2018-07-04 22:11:32 Didn't help they couldnt bring oil can boyd in game 7 but being drunk might leave it tough to pitch
1051 2018-07-04 22:11:32 Per the manual oil needs to meet the MS-6395 standard, thus synthetics are the ones. You can drive up to 10K miles with them (also per the manual). @ 5K is wasting money, or paying them twice. Invoice should say the type of oil they used. Warranty covers only what's recommended
1052 2018-07-04 22:11:31 Invade Mexico and Venezuela, seize the oil??? Why not??? What's the worst that could happen you Orange Bloviating Turd???
1053 2018-07-04 22:11:22 You're right they should reduce oil price & you should reduce arm price 2way road Mr. My way or the highway 
1054 2018-07-04 22:11:20 They don't call them the cartel for nothing! Eliminate our need for oil eliminate our need for foreign oil eliminate the cartel the cartel of held us hostage long enough be gone with them
1055 2018-07-04 22:11:18 Firstly, those countries still have market economies, so they’re not socialist. Secondly, they’re not as prosperous as you think...with the exception of Norway due to their oil and gas backed sovereign wealth fund. Libertarians believe in a lot of the things Greens voters support
1056 2018-07-04 22:11:17 Earth to Donald - when prices are low, US oil drillers lay off employees and shut down exploration. Higher prices = stronger oil and gas industry. Isn’t that what you want???
1057 2018-07-04 22:11:16 It is the unstability that is driving prices north, not where the US gets its oil.  In any event, Trump is not truly fighting for cheaper prices, he is simply setting up OPEC to take the blame when the economy begins to crash due to tariff wars.
1058 2018-07-04 22:11:15 You telling the oil barons what to do!!!
1059 2018-07-04 22:11:10 Perhaps you shouldn’t have ripped up Iran deal. Perhaps you shouldn’t have F’d up the solar energy market taking away competition that keeps oil prices down. So much NOT WINNING!

1069 2018-07-04 22:10:26 Dude...OPEC is a group of nations, and in no way constitutes a monopoly (I know, I know... you've been bankrupt 4 times so I should know that you DON'T know).  The US produces oil (not an OPEC member).  Russia produces oil (not an OPEC member).  Do you need help with this stuff?
1070 2018-07-04 22:10:25 No problem with pure lavender oil if diluted with 10 times the amount of pure coconut oil and used topically. Or pure lavender oil drops used not on their skin but on their objects like bedding or blankies or collars.

Argue with facts.
1073 2018-07-04 22:09:51 I'm just saying if we don't burn the coal and oil made by dead dinosaurs then their sacrifice was all for nothing
1074 2018-07-04 22:09:35 Guess that King Salmon Fantasy Oil Deal that you announced 4 days ago (which they denied) didn’t materialize. Just add it to the Trump 4000+ lies. Trump actually thinks someone will listen to him. His imaginary friends are just laughing at him and Americans are paying the price
1075 2018-07-04 22:09:26 Had to laugh at Peters' reaction to this considering COL decision to support ending oil exploration. No logic there.
1076 2018-07-04 22:09:19 i dropped a hair oil bottle on my foot during shower today and it's swollen and i just decided to press ok the bruise and now my foot hurts sooooooo baaaaaaad i wanna die
1077 2018-07-04 22:09:18 Oooooooooooorrr you could just invest in renewable energy and EV tech to remove American dependency on foreign oil
1078 2018-07-04 22:09:17 Remember that time Obama said that we need to break our dependence on foreign oil? No?  Also Joey, there was no bailout for OPEC...ever.  Good job at making up #FakeNews.
1079 2018-07-04 22:09:15 In general, any essential oils that are not pure and have chemicals in them have the potential to harm pets. So you do have to be careful with them. You don't want your kitty to ingest any essential oil. You also don't want her to directly inhale the fumes.
1080 2018-07-04 22:09:11 After they got it wrong the third time, i asked them to serve me tostones with a garlic sauce.

They gave me tostones with a side of canola oil with salt.

This is not service #followers and I told him that in Spanish.
1081 2018-07-04 22:09:10 Fuck jiffy lube. Working on cars is cool but 15 minute oil changes aint hype
1082 2018-07-04 22:09:04 Pruitt is sponsored by oil and gas donors so he is untouchable. Once he finishes tearing down EPA, and energy companies are making billions, they will sponsor him to run for high office in Oklahoma.

1085 2018-07-04 22:08:52 Dear Mr. Mueller,

Thank you for looking into the tacit relationship between GOP members of U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations, their Fourth of July Kremlin visit, removal of sanctions, and big oil.

Best,

America

P.S. Can see now why you seem to be moving slowly…
@Maddow
1086 2018-07-04 22:08:50 He’s gonna cause another oil embargo and find some excuse to invade Venezuela
1087 2018-07-04 22:08:45 Coconut oil always works best
1088 2018-07-04 22:08:42 Why don't you ask oil companies in America to sell oil cheaper?This is just a way to sell oil for Russia and pay back Putin
1089 2018-07-04 22:08:35 You realize you help create these high gas prices with taking US out of Iran deal and sanctions on Venezuela!  Saudia Arabia, Russia want you to request more oil from them! These gas prices along with Tariffs are hurting Average American who gained very little from your tax cut!
1090 2018-07-04 22:08:34 #DonaldTrump picks a row with OPEC.  Via Twitter.

This may actually (despite what has goner before) be a new low.
Diplomacy score 0%. or even negative if the implied threat over defence is included.

As if a ravenous desire for cheap oil hadn't tarnished the US enough already.
1091 2018-07-04 22:08:33 both of you can go chug motor oil
1092 2018-07-04 22:08:16 Mr. Trump OPEC does not set the price of oil.  It’s the free market and supply and demand. You should know that.
1093 2018-07-04 22:08:14 @realDonaldTrump saw $$$$$ in all that oil.  Invade...kill some humans...take the oil...break international law.  He loves war.  I heard him say it.
1094 2018-07-04 22:08:08 The EU will welcome the oil-rich Scots - speedily. Scotland is estimated to have the largest oil reserves in the European  Union, accounting for nearly 60 per cent of total EU reserves.
1095 2018-07-04 22:08:04 OPEC has never been a friend of us oil producers, maybe it’s time we cut them loose
1096 2018-07-04 22:07:58 Speaking of politics and things that go together like oil and water: smashers and politics
1097 2018-07-04 22:07:58 post indy they wont have to , the licences were granted by a foreign state thus void - and if the oil companies think they have a complaint , legally , they might be right , just not on Scotland.
1098 2018-07-04 22:07:53 Stay off the #booze #trump at the 19th hole.  I do not need #gas or #oil prices to go up b/c you had a bad round of #golf or your wife won't pay any attention to you!
1099 2018-07-04 22:07:51 Maybe he’s not actually a fireman? Maybe he’s a stripper with a fireman’s outfit and the lino is needed because of all the body oil? 
1100 2018-07-04 22:07:50 Now Playing Joshua Rogers - Pour Your Oil
1101 2018-07-04 22:07:48 You know oil is more than just "make car go vroom", right?
1102 2018-07-04 22:07:38 Recently the deficit has been large because the oil price crashed so badly (but also because SNP spending on free stuff..which isn't free really...costs.

The deficit is truly only relevant as a % of the economy ,likewise the deb, and many things impact on it..not least inflation
1103 2018-07-04 22:07:37 What happen to our oil? Why not ask them to produce more since you bankrupted U.S. with your tax cut that benefits corporations and the wealthy. Your a liar,Don the Con.
1104 2018-07-04 22:07:32 I won't even ask what SIL is doing - standing and watching? I'm sure it's delicious. I'm watching the nut on the Statue of Liberty. Wish they could spray her w/oil so she could slide right off-whoopsie. I have no sympathy for jerks protesting nothing, endangering cops' lives.
1105 2018-07-04 22:07:14 We're one of the world's largest oil exporters. Our gas prices are high because of tax. Still among the cheapest in Europe when ranked by purchasing power, though. And almost 50% of cars sold are electric or hybrid-electric.
1106 2018-07-04 22:07:01 Thought you called them and they said they would pump more oil? Guess not, donnie.....
1107 2018-07-04 22:06:58 Everyone. Except the power, coal and oil companies that keep lining his pockets with green. The man is a tool. Period. Of all of Trump’s misguided and illogical appointees, the worst.
1108 2018-07-04 22:06:42 We need to wake up! The increase in tankers means an increase in production of the Alberta oil sands. This cannot happen if we are at all serious about tackling #climatechange. @JustinTrudeau, what kind of leader ignores the biggest threat facing humanity today?! #Canada #stopKM
1109 2018-07-04 22:06:42 But you said the Saudi's agreed to pump more oil, just for you. They did, at the OPEC Summit a week before your lie about asking them, they agreed among themselves to increase production. I just read a report about you wanting to invade Venezuela last August. The sp-oils of war?
1110 2018-07-04 22:06:38 We need to transition away from oil
1111 2018-07-04 22:06:35 Ooops! Last week you tweeted that your friend, King Salmon, the autocrat who rules (and owns) Saudi Arabia had agreed to your request that they increase the production of oil to keep prices down. Now you're complaining it didn't happen. Not much of a "dealmaker" are you, eh?
1112 2018-07-04 22:06:35 I have everything all packed up all I have left to do is clean and get an oil change
1113 2018-07-04 22:06:27 He couldn't get Iraq's oil so he figured he could get Venezuela's
1114 2018-07-04 22:06:27 Coconut oil is literally the most trustable oil there is. Literally. #shitElanasays
1115 2018-07-04 22:06:08 But, but, but you said they agreed to release more oil??? Was that a (gasp!) lie??
1116 2018-07-04 22:06:05 That makes sense. While they deny global warming is happening, they make a move on oil and gas in warming regions
1117 2018-07-04 22:06:03 I don’t have enough expertise to know why oil prices are up. But I’m pretty sure that Trump DEMANDING action from OPEC is not the effective path to lower pricing.
1118 2018-07-04 22:05:55 2 Mason jar mimosas and cbd oil under my tongue and we're ready to fucking party
1119 2018-07-04 22:05:53 My room smells like a mix between tea tree oil and chicken. It’s weirdly intoxicating
1120 2018-07-04 22:05:52 Sharon, if people had a right to vote on the pipeline, you'd still be unhappy.  The number of no votes from BC would be nothing compared to the yes votes from Alberta.  Saskatchewan and Manitoba, as they also have huge untapped oil reserves, would likely vote yes too.
1121 2018-07-04 22:05:50 +HR+ If sin were welcomed in Heaven, Heaven would leave. Oil and vinegar do not mix. Life on Earth is not as homogeneous as that.
1122 2018-07-04 22:05:49 Ok just clarify your position then. Do you accept that the fact that 92% of the oil that is extracted is used as a fuel is a major problem because of the heat that the resulting CO2 traps?
1123 2018-07-04 22:05:40 Things ARE looking up - slightly, because the oil and gas revenue is up. So, why are you trying to kill it? It's the only way #Alberta will get out of the enormous hole you've dug with your inept handling of finances and increasing the size of government.
1124 2018-07-04 22:05:35 Trump’s a twit. Very little US Oil imports come from OPEC. 40% comes from Canada, then Mexico, then Venezuela.
1125 2018-07-04 22:05:33 What’s that got to do with the price of oil ? Or the fact trump claimed at the weekend to have spoken to the Saudis who agreed to release more oil o keep the price down but in fact they had no such conversation or agreement ?
1126 2018-07-04 22:05:31 If Iran is prevent from selling oil what does it have to loose?
1127 2018-07-04 22:05:29 Whether you choose to accept it or not oil is pervasive to 21st century life and there is no AFFORDABLE alternative. Everything you have in your life has been touched by the "tarsands". Oil extraction is far cleaner today than 40 years ago and it will be more so 40 years from now
1128 2018-07-04 22:05:21 Nice try... Canada is one of the lowest emission oil producers on Earth, with a much more constant and complete reclamation standard.

Greenpeace (and their celebrity hypocrites) don't like to inform you of THAT portion of the story though, do they?
1129 2018-07-04 22:05:18 I recommand Iranian Mullahs to stop working for the oil comanies and to overgive Iran to the Iranians. Iranian 7000 years old CULTURE will destrory Mullah-Regime! 7 Million Iranians outside of Iran and 80 Mio. Iranians inside of Iran,  hate the Mullahs badly.Nothing is performed!
1130 2018-07-04 22:04:52 Truly love that New Zealand  meat and dairy has embraced GMO alarmism. Shame they aren't so worried about climate science, palm oil, filthy rivers, and over-irrigation...
1131 2018-07-04 22:04:51 The US doesn’t need shitty middle eastern oil anymore! This is bullshit!!
1132 2018-07-04 22:04:49 Govern tax on gasoline does indeed drive up the cost of gas, quite a it.  The oil companies set oil prices not gas prices, which do effect gas to an extent but the taxes on gasoline itself have a big impact as well.  The same with cigarettes.  Taxes cause prices to increase.
1133 2018-07-04 22:04:47 Thank u president Trump for acknowledging there is s problem with inflated oil prices keep on them.
1134 2018-07-04 22:04:43 boy cot their oil. veninzula
is better choice n cheaper
1135 2018-07-04 22:04:37 You do understand oil prices are rising because inflation? Are you not getting it?
1136 2018-07-04 22:04:36 The incumbent government paid debts and liabilities dating back to 1991 in oil bust while the former had to borrow to pay salaries in oil boom. 
Argue with facts.
1137 2018-07-04 22:04:34 Every bit of that tweet is a lie. He wants oil prices high because it helps his Puty.
1138 2018-07-04 22:04:31 Wow...why not...lots of OIL over there....they invaded Iraq, Syria, control Libya....who's next ? Ops...Canada maybe....
1139 2018-07-04 22:04:30 Nuclear Bombs for oil doesn’t seem like a good deal to me. #WakeUpAmerica #irandeal #MAGA
1140 2018-07-04 22:04:28 He's no oil painting
1141 2018-07-04 22:04:24 The Heptio gum is to hold the device, that you build with the honey bear, in place. The honey, tea, & oil get mixed and put in the empty Heptio tin. This goes in the empty bear, fill the bear with the butane. The butane will ignite the honey, tea, & oil making a smoke diversion.
1142 2018-07-04 22:04:22 Also, Oil of Ulay would be a good choice for a non-adhesive moisturiser.
1143 2018-07-04 22:04:17 After more than 36 hours an RCMP extraction team are right above my anchor.

Whatever happens the resistance to this destructive project will just continue to grow. 

Water is more important than oil. #NoTMX #StopPipelines #cdnpoli #bcpoli #green #ecofriendly #environment
1144 2018-07-04 22:03:58 Because there was more oil on the market. OPEC need time to adjust.
1145 2018-07-04 22:03:56 (Though not by THAT much because that economy running the high deficit is much smaller than the UK as a whole).  IN many years , even with oil, Scotland has run a deficit, in some it has run a surplus (liker the years Alex Salmond liked to talk about.
1146 2018-07-04 22:03:56 okay so i’m starting to put vaseline and coconut oil on my eyelashes and eyebrows every night cause my eyelashes are shit and i want them to grow so i’ll update you
1147 2018-07-04 22:03:49 Wait till they stop using the dollar for Oil trades, and move to say... the Euro. Trump is such a baffoon.
1148 2018-07-04 22:03:49 #BB20 1:35pm BBT Angela, Kaitlyn, Brett and Winston in the BBR. Brett is in pain and getting an essential oil massage from Kaitlyn. The indoor LD is killing these folks.
1149 2018-07-04 22:03:49 Hope u have to dig around it but not really winter unless I smell of Tiger balm and amla oil.
1150 2018-07-04 22:03:45 Okay this is what I’ve done! I washed it in warm water with soap, then mixed in some tea tree oil with coconut oil and rubbed it on ;;; I hope I can wear some good shoes tomorrow lmao
1151 2018-07-04 22:03:31 she should try natural oils like castor oil & tea tree & even hair growth products, her hair will come back longer & healthier. she needs to stay away from heat & perms & harsh chemicals like bleach or dyes
1152 2018-07-04 22:03:31 Didn't you tweet that you had already solved the oil 'crisis' with your little Saudi friend??? "Just spoke to King Salman of Saudi Arabia asking that Saudi Arabia increase oil production, maybe up to 2,000,000 barrels, to make up the difference..He has agreed!"

7:37 AM - 30 Jun
1153 2018-07-04 22:03:16 Your mistake in Iran w/sanctions, the lack of shale oil in the US, and the disruption in Libya is to blame for higher oil prices. OPEC doesn't have enough production leeway to make oil and gas prices decline. This is all on your back as you never should have blown up about Iran.
1154 2018-07-04 22:03:01 Just sum it up in 3 letters: OIL
1155 2018-07-04 22:03:00 #OOTT #Oil #WTI
#CME has resumed #US Oil trading post the 4th of July Holiday. Expect high volatility to stay throughout the remaining sessions of this week.
1156 2018-07-04 22:02:59 Putin is playing another Novichok game knowing you will cover his ass and talk about FAKE world peace but that is more like talking privately and supporting each other in power and oil profit!
1157 2018-07-04 22:02:40 Another option is try to reduce carbon consumption (oil, gas, coal). So the influence of opec will go down.
Attention to wind, solar,... keeps energy production out of foreign influence and can create jobs of future.
1158 2018-07-04 22:02:32 Your sanctions on Iran's oil caused the increase in price. And Putin loves it!
1159 2018-07-04 22:02:31 Hey, Trumpchuck I am starting to think you lie. Didn't you tweet you had spoken to Saudia Arabia personally and they agreed to violate OPEC agreement for you and release the hounds (sorry, couldn't resist), mean release more oil? What happened??
1160 2018-07-04 22:02:30 the only thing scotland has as a positive was the oil which is worthless now. keep your oil field would save us a fortune in getting rid of scotland
1161 2018-07-04 22:02:23 The US doesn't import much oil, so I doubt it would have much effect. A tax would be much better.
1162 2018-07-04 22:02:19 Oil refining is what's needed. Not more oil
1163 2018-07-04 22:02:12 U.S. oil production is booming at record levels, and U.S. oil exports have also reached new highs — 3 million barrels a day in the last week, according to government data.   And that is why oil prices are rising. Nothing to do with OPEC.
1164 2018-07-04 22:02:09 OPEC? Oil prices being up in the US is NOT necessarily a BAD THING. (caps for emphasis) (misspellings on purpose) (I a genus)
Now saying the mid class get tax cuts - (wealthy really got them) then raising prices through TARIFFS is  taking back the tax cuts. TARIFFS R TAXES
1165 2018-07-04 22:02:04 Happy Fourth of July from the Lucas Oil National Open Wheel 600 Series!
1166 2018-07-04 22:01:54 Surprised cost isnt mentioned- isnt the problem its unbeatable price? Discussing ‘Sustainable palm oil’ without addressing how to achieve real cost, supply chain transparency and the right incentives is not saying much... how do we get there- your thoughts @mbperricone :) ?
1167 2018-07-04 22:01:44 Went to @NorfolkLavender today, never managed to get there in season before! Watched the distillery in action & heard about the process of oil extraction. Got lavender wax in the burner right now! Great stuff  and lovely to see so many bees!!
1168 2018-07-04 22:01:42 Why! The US is oil rich! Your train runs on US oil!!
1169 2018-07-04 22:01:41 Jamaican black castor oil works wonders for growth and health!
1170 2018-07-04 22:01:40 I loaded my body up on lavender oil to repel against chiggers and I put body spray and what not on and now I smelt like burnt hair
1171 2018-07-04 22:01:40 Why are we not exporting more? #obama exported oil.
1172 2018-07-04 22:01:39 You can also use it topically in 1:10 ratio. Where is it dilluted by other oils like coconut oil or olive oil. It is antiseptic and antibacterial . Lavender herb extract is one of the ingredients of our topical anti tick spray. 
1173 2018-07-04 22:01:33 USA AND ISREAL WILL BE THE 2 COUNTRIES THAT OTHERS COME TO FOR OIL. THE MIDDLE EASTERN WELLS GOING DRY.
1174 2018-07-04 22:01:31 6/6 America needs AMERICAN OIL.  America needs AMERICAN ENERGY!  America needs to become ENERGY INDEPENDENT!  We need a comprehensive Energy Plan, including a floor on Oil prices to prevent OPEC from using preditory pricing practices to bankrupt our domestic oil companies.
1175 2018-07-04 22:01:31 Yeah, we just need a massive production increase for palm oil and lard, then we're good to go!
1176 2018-07-04 22:01:30 You did this by stopping oil from Iran. Gas prices will go up
1177 2018-07-04 22:01:29 The Consumer Protection Association has confirmed that over 4,000 people involved in a class action suit against edible oil maker Chang Guan will receive the compensation they were promised.

1180 2018-07-04 22:01:12 The next time you have to endure listening to trump yammer on about unfair trade and NAFTA, please remind him that the second he kills NAFTA we no longer have to sell our crude oil to US refineries at the same price we sell it to Canadian refineries.
1181 2018-07-04 22:01:07 Does anyone else think, that soon after the Putin/Trump asset debriefing, we will find out that a joint effort has been launched by China/Russia/USA to extract the Russian oil reserves and that Russia/China our new allies, to relieve the OPEC price hike, will be selling us crude?
1182 2018-07-04 22:00:54 Fox news.... the center of now..... they are advocating this idea of Opec manipulating prices when a) oil is a global commodity b) traded in the free market c) with multiple price sources..... Beside, who is talking???? Shall we remind the @federalreserve for a decade of......??
1183 2018-07-04 22:00:52 We have plenty of drilling companies and oil service outfits and pipeline construction companies just lean on them more.
1184 2018-07-04 22:00:51 Trump wants to invade Venezuela for the OIL!!! He doesn't care about their people or Refugees from there. He probably couldn't find it on a map! Pruity-Trump-EXXON invasion plan!
1185 2018-07-04 22:00:49 3/6 America Needs an IMPORT Tariff on Foreign Oil to PREVENT OPEC from Preditory Pricing Prices used to prevent America from becoming Energy Self-Sufficient.  America must have Price floor to prevent this. $65 or $70 per barrel FLOOR would enable us to be weaned from OPEC oil.
1186 2018-07-04 22:00:48 People come here because we destabilized the hell out of south & central america in pursuit of oil, bananas, and ideology.  The USA has been purposefully fucking up latin america since the 50s, and now we're paying for the long-term effects of meddling in their democracies.

1194 2018-07-04 22:00:19 So, now Opec is to blame? The fact that you pissed off Iran and we no longer get their oil in our market has nothng to do with it? The @GOP has no balls to call you out! All you do is pass the buck to others! By the way, that timy temporary tax cut of 2.9% avg does nothing.
1195 2018-07-04 22:00:14 It's all to do with oil, an agreement was signed in 1972 after the oil crisis. They want growth. For ever, whatever it costs.

1200 2018-07-04 22:00:00 NEWSFLASH: OPEC really does not care what you think about oil prices. Our military was not and is not mercenaries they don't fight for money.  It is truly sad on this the 4th of July you dont get that.
1201 2018-07-04 21:59:53 Yep so true I make cococanna oil with ice water full melt I can get it strong ;) 

1202 2018-07-04 21:59:42 Free in the sense that the oil or uranium or sunshine is just there. Takes effort and knowledge to harness. If someone had easy cheap energy, it'd be everywhere. Too many advantages.
1203 2018-07-04 21:59:35 what is he doing in Nigeria....looking for oil and how to rob and loot Africa?
1204 2018-07-04 21:59:33 Venezuela got lots of oil though. I think most Venezuelans would like to be Americans, so we can Annex them, like Crimea.
1205 2018-07-04 21:59:32 You have NO FUCKIN' IDEA how OPEC, diplomacy, trade and foreign policy works do you, fuck-knuckle?  Good luck with ORDERING oil prices to be lowered, via Twitter.
1206 2018-07-04 21:59:30 OPEC do not care about Donald Trump. Their interest is making as much money as they possibly can before their oil wells dry up and they no longer have any income.
1207 2018-07-04 21:59:29 Lavender oil is safe to use topically on their objects. Place a drop or two away from their mouth on their collar and you have nothing to worry about. It has calming and soothing effect on them. And of course everything is safe only in moderation 
1208 2018-07-04 21:59:29 Why should they do what you ask? Yelling at OPEC will not move them to do what you ask.  They have the oil.  Bullying will not work with them!
1209 2018-07-04 21:59:17 Gasoline is already the cheapest liquid on the planet! (Even when ignoring the national average 48.4 Cents at the pump “HIDDEN excise tax”). Even bottled water is $5 to $24/gallon!  Just The "hidden" Excise Tax alone amounts to 2-3x's the TOTAL Profits of Big Oil.
1210 2018-07-04 21:59:16 Trump must know his boyfriend Putin is ratcheting up oil prices, right? Right?!?

Hello? Is this thing on?!?
1211 2018-07-04 21:59:14 Why are you encouraging our dependence on foreign, especially OPEC, oil. It may not have affected you, but I remember the gas shortages of the 70s and how OPEC had us under their heel. So much for America

Water is more important than oil. #NoTMX #StopPipelines #cdnpoli #bcpoli
1215 2018-07-04 21:59:07 Black soap and baking soda for full body exfoliation>>>> 

Then the way the skin is all smooth and absorbing coconut oil...AMAZING!!!!!
1216 2018-07-04 21:59:06 Paul Mitchell skinny serum works great, and Moroccan oil curl cream is awesome too!
1217 2018-07-04 21:59:03 It’s not solely about oil prices moron.
1218 2018-07-04 21:59:01 @oppenheimera 
Ortegas has killed 309 people so far in 76 days. 

Vzla 131 in 3 yrs; Ukraine 123 in 94 days. Our pop. are 6.5, 31 & 42 million respectively.

We, unlike Vzla and Ukraine, don't have oil and/or gas. Outside of Cold War context, we just have poor people and tourism.
1219 2018-07-04 21:58:42 Hang on, you're the one who blocked Iran's oil, causing the price of oil to rise. It's on you so don't expect people to cover your incompetence. It's ALL on you. Resign.
1220 2018-07-04 21:58:41 You and I both know Putin wants and needs high oil prices and you are more that willing to help him out
1221 2018-07-04 21:58:39 I trim mine like every 4-5 months. Now I don’t want to though since it’s super short.  Only washing your hair 1–2 times a week helps so much with growth, and I use a healing oil on my hair as well. Not using heat or high chemical products often helps a ton!
1222 2018-07-04 21:58:35 BTW - you are manifestly wrong about the science behind climate change. The science of it has been good since the 1980s when Exxon confirmed it & hid its studies so it could continue to sell oil.
1223 2018-07-04 21:58:26 What oil could they trade? Are the Canadians in on it too? Doesn’t Russia have enough oil of their own that they are trying to get to market?  This theory doesn’t make sense
1224 2018-07-04 21:58:20 Cayenne and lemon water(sometimes warm with honey) in the morning. Matcha green tea powder, water, and peppermint oil mixed cold for the afternoon.  Sometimes I'll add matcha to my oats/smoothies/pancakes too. APPLES AND NUT BUTTER!
1225 2018-07-04 21:58:14 Saudi Arabia needs oil at at least $75 or better to fund everything and not dip into their wealth fund, they want high prices.
1226 2018-07-04 21:58:10 So no one is producing oil except OPEC members?
1227 2018-07-04 21:58:10 The guys that refine oil In teapots?
1228 2018-07-04 21:58:06 When gas prices at the pump are so high  Why is the US exporting Oil ??? #CCOT
1229 2018-07-04 21:58:00 Seeing as it hasn't rained in like a moth, all the oil an crud will lift off the road making it extremely dangerous to ride in, I always avoid it
1230 2018-07-04 21:57:47 Jeez, do you even understand how OPEC works. Their purpose is to keep oil prices high by controlling production.  Why on earth would they ever listen to you. When you say two way street what do you mean??
1231 2018-07-04 21:57:42 I have this beard oil stuff. I love it cuz it smells delicious. I like applying it to myself and my beard so we can smell delicious. :3
1232 2018-07-04 21:57:37 @realDonaldTrump  I thought when we pumped our own oil prices would be cheaper at the pump, yet its nearly $3.00 gallon now. Why can't gas prices be around $1.50 since we are not dependent on outside oil? This is plenty for oil companies to make a profit on. Please do something.
1233 2018-07-04 21:57:30 there’s really nothing you can do after the damage is done besides a good olive oil mask and a coconut oil treatment after bleaching & toning. I always recommend going blonde when you have a few inches to spare and can cut it to make the ends feel better
1234 2018-07-04 21:57:29 Im other news I changed my skincare routine and my acne cleared up and so have my dark spots but I’m thinking of changing my oil and possibly getting some stuff from the ordinary but it’s so confusing
1235 2018-07-04 21:57:21 TMX will build an entirely new line to carry crude oil for export, but it also expands the capacity of the existing line (which carries both refined products and crude oil) by 50,000 barrels per day. That's roughly equal to the output of the Parkland refinery.
1236 2018-07-04 21:57:17 You do know how oil prices work?  Opec does not set pricing.  They set production levels.  Isn't it impressive how they can work with each other and NEGOTIATE production to influence prices?  Almost like having allies.
1237 2018-07-04 21:57:13 My comment wasn’t in regards to the particular situation btwn Iraq and Venezuela. The comment is a sarcastic recall of the Bush43 admin telling us the war/regime change would be easy, inexpensive as the oil would pay for it, & the US would be greeted as liberators. None was true.
1238 2018-07-04 21:57:11 So they should increase production of oil to make prices lower?  There’s not an unlimited supply.  Granted some of it is gerrymandering, but higher pricing also fosters innovation. US gets most of its oil from non OPEC sources anyway.
1239 2018-07-04 21:57:07 Hey Bsmooth Beard Oil(@BsmoothBeardOil), thank you for following me
1240 2018-07-04 21:57:06 Hey, Trump wants to invade Venezuela for the OIL!!!! He doesn't care about their people or Refugees!!! It's a Trump-Pruitt-EXXON invasion plan! OIL!!!
1241 2018-07-04 21:57:02 The oil business is kind of like the health insurance business: if you don't use much, the price goes up because their costs go up. If you use a lot, the prices go up because of demand. Either way, they pocket your money. Makes no sense unless you own a lot of oil stock.
1242 2018-07-04 21:57:00 America needs AMERICAN OIL.  America needs AMERICAN ENERGY!  America needs to become ENERGY INDEPENDENT!  We need a comprehensive Energy Plan, including a floor on Oil prices to prevent OPEC from using preditory pricing practices to bankrupt our domestic oil companies.
1243 2018-07-04 21:56:53 What happened to I called the King of Saudi Arabia an told him to lower the oil prices... LMAO...
1244 2018-07-04 21:56:52 he will never succeed in his chosen field of snake oil sales.
1245 2018-07-04 21:56:40 For fun let's do some math.

The annual cost of the Iraq invasion was approximately $100 billion.

Avg 2018 price of crude oil per barrel $67.33

OPEC output today 320 000 BPD

1/x
1246 2018-07-04 21:56:40 Is this all about the US not being able to have oil from Canada as Syncrude in the province of Alberts has repairs that are needing to be done in July?
1247 2018-07-04 21:56:28 No mystery. Oil now >$70, Putin wants>$100. R Senators in Russia thumbing noses at Trump Russia Senate Intel probe which THEY KNOW should be the Russia Republican Trump probe. They’re saying “we”, Party of Big Oil control Govn’t in alignment w country of Oil, Russia.
1248 2018-07-04 21:56:22 The petrol price has nothing to do with oil production. This tweet is a lie. Petrol is based on the Singapore Market. NOTHING to do will OIL PRODUCTION. Trump Lying to his base again.
1249 2018-07-04 21:56:13 The issues with the oil trucks and container trucks baffles me.
Plus, the Apapa traffic situation and dangers surrounding it is insane.

One question is, ... Is the Lagos port the only sea port in the whole of Nigeria???

@nassnigeria @bukolasaraki @nigerianports @henryshield
1250 2018-07-04 21:56:13 it's ok
just don't freak out when your opec "friends" starts to accept other currencies instead of just dollars on the oil trade.
1251 2018-07-04 21:55:58 Working on these chairs today. I've decided to keep them for our set. I cleaned them well and gave them a generous coat of hemp oil. New fabric on the first one and three more to go! Sometimes paint isn't the best option! Happy fourth ya'll!
1252 2018-07-04 21:55:52 Adruand, as Professional Financial Speculator I wanna tell you that I open Short Oil position $75.10 with TP $47.10 and SL$75.95
1253 2018-07-04 21:55:47 What happened to your brilliant idea to steal Iraq's oil?
1254 2018-07-04 21:55:43 Hi! :) you might not be getting enough fats, don’t be afraid, add olive oil, avocado, fatty meats to your diet. I’m down 12 pounds in less than 2 weeks
1255 2018-07-04 21:55:40 You get a chance, read 'America's War for the Greater Middle East' by @AndrewBacevich. Interestingly, we didn't even have or need CENTCOM until our oil was limited in the 70s. Anyone who says our presence in the Middle East isn't about anything but oil is delusional.
1256 2018-07-04 21:55:37 Do you have any statements about essential oils and cats? especially liver toxicity? We use essential oils on humans, horses but are concerned for our feline friends. 
We would be worried about lavender oil near cats. We have been worried about peppermint used to control spiders.
1257 2018-07-04 21:55:35 The time may have come for the US to take control of oil prices again. Can’t leave it in hands of OPEC.
1258 2018-07-04 21:55:31 And your actions against the tankers going to the Washington refineries? How about the 20 thousand+ railcars taking Bakken oil down the Columbia to the same refineries? (Remember Lac Megantic?)
Hypocrisy at its finest!
1259 2018-07-04 21:55:14 Don't you know being PM of Canada  is a free ride. 
The affairs of Canada mean nothing unless its costume design, travel,  $60 million dollars by election smelter deal, eyebrows, groping, gender, immagration, PQ transfer payments, Arabic oil imports
1260 2018-07-04 21:55:13 oil of every pearls un insides > ye > die lit > ksg > red light > ktse
1261 2018-07-04 21:55:09 By the way, #Nigeria has plenty oil. Now it makes sense why #France President will be going there.
1262 2018-07-04 21:54:55 A lot of complicated math and many calls to manufacture, but figured out how to direct vent this oil furnace with no power fan. Raised efficiency from 82% to 94%
And got that ugly pipe out of middle of new living room. Works better then perfect
1263 2018-07-04 21:54:48 Funny, I just interviewed Prof. Ed Hirs, UofHouston, he told me a lot of American shale producers are having trouble accessing capital, funds are under-weight on oil and gas, and a lot of $$ is going to repair balance sheets, not drill. Oh, and pipeline constraints in the Permian
1264 2018-07-04 21:54:48 Idk what kinda oil and gold they paid Ella to allow such foolishness on her song. Smh. Oh well I hope she's happy cuz I'm not
1265 2018-07-04 21:54:46 George W. Bush refused to raise the vehicle cafe standards and the price of oil soared. Consumers and businesses rapidly took on debt rapidly.  Due primarily to elevated oil prices and a collapse in the secondary mortgage (creditors making risky loans) the economy collapsed.
1266 2018-07-04 21:54:45 YOU caused oil/gas prices to go up because YOU backed out of Iran deal. But oh wait, YOU always blame someone else for YOUR bad decisions.
1267 2018-07-04 21:54:34 dear you yg botak(baldly) more consume peanut n its families n kemiri n salmon fish n fish oil,more reading at least 5000 words a day,an hour a day...dont b lazy for reading both grey hair n baldy hair.. hope in one year u will get better hair but not as bold as normal hair
1268 2018-07-04 21:54:33 Trying to steal their oil.
1269 2018-07-04 21:54:32 Higher Oil prices could be a good thing for America. We could make American technologies Great for America, since America has an abundance of Natural resource but those damned toothless Kentucky and oil state Hill billy Hillary into prison bastard, southern state anoles support >
1270 2018-07-04 21:54:24 Me tooooo! It’s so yum on so many things   especially with sundried tomatoes, roasted garlic cloves and a little olive oil 
1271 2018-07-04 21:54:23 Weird how oil companies keep raising prices despite massive corporate tax breaks, disappearing regulations, and record profits.

It's almost as if they prefer maximizing shareholder value to making you look good with low prices.

Shouldn't you have given them a nickname by now?
1272 2018-07-04 21:54:22 ...except when it's not, like when the Fed government gives welfare to the oil companies, agra, pharma - (the list of corp welfare recipients: too long), but lie about this Nation being capitalist (an old joke). BTW, Soviets were totalitarian. Govt system ain't economic system.
1273 2018-07-04 21:54:19 I’m sure the oil magnates are following orders from your little twitter rants.
1274 2018-07-04 21:54:14 y’all coconut oil smells heavenly
1275 2018-07-04 21:54:11 Snake oil?
1276 2018-07-04 21:54:04 America government should come to Biafra land and take our gas for 50 years free and support our freedom , Nigeria and Britain have take Biafra our oil and gas for 104 years now nothing good to show only killing killing killing looting and corruption
1277 2018-07-04 21:53:59 Student pilot คือดียยยย์
1278 2018-07-04 21:53:48 How about not upsetting world markets by tearing up Iran deal, starting trade wars, and promoting your fascist ideas? YOU are the reason oil is up. But since you think you are GOD and make NO MISTAKES you blame everyone but YOU! Good thing Mueller is coming and Cohen is flipping!
1279 2018-07-04 21:53:47 They are not a monopoly. It's seriously like you don't actually understand anything of which you speak.

The world complained when they caused the global crash in oil prices, and now that there is a steady increase, on which US O&G businesses BENEFIT, you complain again?!?
1280 2018-07-04 21:53:46 For coming into power in IRAN: Iranian Mullahs promissed to the British Intelligence Service and CIA to KILL Iranians, to Ruine Iranian Economy and Idustry, to make a fake war against Iraq, to bring crude oil prices to the lowest possible level and to subdivid Iran through a war!
1281 2018-07-04 21:53:22 Looks like oil will come in around $90 a barrel . Forcourts here £1.38 /40 by Christmas
1282 2018-07-04 21:53:16 What do you think pays for your way of life? Oil
1283 2018-07-04 21:53:12 If oil is made from decomposed dinosaurs, and plastic is made from oil - plastic dinosaurs are made from real dinosaurs.
1284 2018-07-04 21:53:11 If you don't think Trump is releasing oil from the SPR in August in an attempt to lower gas prices for the midterms, you haven't been paying attention.
1285 2018-07-04 21:53:05 Try moving from OPEC and using your own oil
1286 2018-07-04 21:53:01 SOLAR ENERGY
It’s safe energy!
It’s clean energy!
It’s renewable energy!
It’s non-polluting energy!
It works for homes and cars!
It’s a total no-brainer!!
Oh wait! Republicans and big oil can’t make any money from it!!!
1287 2018-07-04 21:52:58 Can you guys get me a very good crude oil buyer from China.
1288 2018-07-04 21:52:57 You people are so delusional.  It’s honestly pitiful.  You’d buy from a snake oil salesmen, bless your 
1289 2018-07-04 21:52:53 I got myself some coconut oil that actually smells like coconut and I'm struggling af not to eat it

1291 2018-07-04 21:52:47 Trump wants to invade Venezuela for their OIL!!! He doesn't care about people there or their Refugees! Pruitt-Trump-EXXON Deal to Invade Venezuela!!!! OIL!!!
1292 2018-07-04 21:52:47 Hey, did you guys know your making lots of money charging us for oil?
Lower your prices or I will insult you on twitter!!!!!!!!
1293 2018-07-04 21:52:36 Why not just use your own crude oil?  Why are you dependent on them?  Just order your American Oil Companies to drop their price in America.
1294 2018-07-04 21:52:35 Meanwhile we are still stuck in the old oil based system because it's cheaper to keep using the old system.
1295 2018-07-04 21:52:25 Handing out the CBD oil biscuits to my pups
1296 2018-07-04 21:52:25 Your entire get up preventing you from falling to your Darwin doom is made possible because of OIL
1297 2018-07-04 21:52:25 Trump is obsessed with oil.
1298 2018-07-04 21:52:12 @MarkUrban01 I'd also question Gerry Smith RE binary agents - I'd rather carry a well sealed vial of it than prepare it on site. It's a viscous oil, so it's not going anywhere fast if well wrapped up. Clearly binary makes sense for transport controls.
1299 2018-07-04 21:52:04 We don't need foreign oil because we can turn grain into biofuel. We can't lose a trade war.
1300 2018-07-04 21:52:00 The second TM pipeline is going to deliver bitumen, not oil. It will be shipped directly to China, and there is no plan to build a bitumen refinery in Burnaby. It will have no impact on our gas imports.
1301 2018-07-04 21:51:59 How can it be a monopoly? Doesn’t US produce oil as well as you buddy Vladimer?
1302 2018-07-04 21:51:58 The US attacked Iraq for oil, Afghanistan for opium, they want Syria because the headquarters of Conoco gas is there. Attacked the Serbs for them defending themselves & so they can put Camp Bondsteel on their land! Your a closed minded person & u can’t even see the big picture!
1303 2018-07-04 21:51:46 #JCPOA European is merely a paper.. 
and with new sanctions on oil on its way..
uuuh~ keep some money to buy yourselves a grave atleast ...
1304 2018-07-04 21:51:43 As President, you should know that the agreement OPEC has among oil producing countries caps the amount of crude oil reserves they can release in a given period. So, in theory it sounds "easy" to bully them into moving-- it's not that simple!
1305 2018-07-04 21:51:42 Your buddy’s the oil companies set the price.
1306 2018-07-04 21:51:41 I beg to disagree wait for the oil inside it to heat up
1307 2018-07-04 21:51:32 Not much chance of Saudi being prepared to drop the oil price prior to the Aramco IPO...
1308 2018-07-04 21:51:31 It’s going well. I tried a couple new recipes. Who knew farro with olive oil and lemon could be so deadly?
1309 2018-07-04 21:51:26 You touted yourself a week or so ago stating that your shrewd negotiations resulted in more oil being produced. What happened?
1310 2018-07-04 21:51:05 It was oil, now gas ?!
You are an excellent buyer
But very bad seller
Mr.president
1311 2018-07-04 21:50:51 As the dollar weakens oil prices go up. Somethings you can’t manipulate.
1312 2018-07-04 21:50:49 Still doesn’t get the oil market. I thought you just made a yuge deal with the Saudi’s? Why would gas prices be high???
1313 2018-07-04 21:50:44 And remember who caused it, # 45. And now he is begging fpr more oil, and will blame everyone but himself for the high prices. Bigly shameful!
1314 2018-07-04 21:50:14 CBS Drama , apparently in those days you could be a millionaire in the oil industry too bad ours is so worthless
1315 2018-07-04 21:50:13 Because US oil is to be used by the military and as reserve for when the world runs out of oil. Do keep up.
1316 2018-07-04 21:50:04 Well his tariffs against Canada and its shale oil is not helping gas prices
1317 2018-07-04 21:50:01 But isn't this what you and Putin wanted all along?  What happened to your idea of oil independence?  It appears that you are handing Putin another gift.
1318 2018-07-04 21:49:56 Why should they help you?  When oil was 35 dollars a barrel not a hand was raised in concern by any oil consuming nation..Since you are such a business whiz, remember supply and demand?  It is that too deep for you?
1319 2018-07-04 21:49:53 Trump does not care what the 32 yr old prince thinks. Remember what happened when MbS visited the Oval Office? To trump MbS is a customer who buys stuff from the US. Notice who Trump called last week about oil - King Salman. But Trump doesn’t care these people think.
1320 2018-07-04 21:49:53 Your pretense that you care about reducing oil prices may play with your ragtag supporters. The rest of us realize your best buddy Putin benefits, along with your Brothers of the Mysterious Orb and we don't doubt you've figured out a way to get your cut from them.
1321 2018-07-04 21:49:51 Iranian nation does NOT like the servants of oil-Neocolonialism in Iran called Mullahs!This crimional gang installed through USA, GB,France and Germany in Iran should work under the cover of Islam for oil and gas companies and own wealth. Now evry thing is decoded!Ende of Mission
1322 2018-07-04 21:49:42 He wants the oil.
1323 2018-07-04 21:49:39 @POTUS You are hilarious. America first, but OPEC can't do OPEC first.  Yeah and don't defend OPEC members and see how high oil prices go when Iran or Russia or China or North Korea start sniffing around. You're doing exactly what Putin needs to bury US? #AWAG
1324 2018-07-04 21:49:39 Trump wants to invade Venezuela to Steal Their OIL!!!!!! He doesn't care about Venezuela or their people or Refugees from there... OIL for EXXON!! Chevron..And you will pay 
costs & high gas prices for the war
1325 2018-07-04 21:49:25 @g0db3rry and I showed my friend how to change her differential oil on her truck today
1326 2018-07-04 21:49:21 We're gonna spend the rest of today having an old horror movie marathon, hunkered down with the dogs, who like it much better when we're home on Noisy Fireworks Day.  This year were are armed not only with  frankincense but also doggy CBD and lavender oil. 

Let the fun begin!

1329 2018-07-04 21:49:11 Don’t mean to offend anyone, but yeah, that’s messed up. You were robbed!
1330 2018-07-04 21:49:08 オイル、君なら地球を救える。
1331 2018-07-04 21:49:07 On dumping oil into the oceans. He didn’t visit those who had their houses flooded he puts children into cages when actually that will cause more problems in the long run mentally. I’m sorry dean if you hate me but he is EVIL. And even I also think that world war 3 will happen
1332 2018-07-04 21:49:04 I could feel a spot coming up on my cheek so put some tea tree oil on it and managed to pour some in my eye and it feels like it's about to disintegrate, someone tell me how I've survived 19 years on this Earth I'm such a dumbass
1333 2018-07-04 21:49:03 Just put my finger in my mouth after removing my nail polish and while it doesn't taste like acetone, it definitely still tastes like nail oil. :(
1334 2018-07-04 21:48:50 It's sad how #france and #britain relies on #cameroon #oil which happens to be in the #anglophone #southerncameroon region so this explains why they keep quiet on the #genocide and probably #bribe the #unitednations and others to oversee #humanrisght #abuses
1335 2018-07-04 21:48:50 I need to get in the house this sweat got me looking like i got baby oil on dawg 
1336 2018-07-04 21:48:38 gone off the fish oil
1337 2018-07-04 21:48:35 Perhaps. But take the Greek economy that is based on services, shipping oil products will be hard to compare to the German one. Perhaps you can compare South Korean since have a big automobile industry. So there peculiarities in economies that make it difficult to compare.
1338 2018-07-04 21:48:33 The mayor also asks for truffle oil for unspecified reasons.
1339 2018-07-04 21:48:15 Opec=30% not a monopoly any more. Outside opec 70% of production. Shortage of oil is not there yet, lots floating around but its a playground for making money being on the right side of future contracts. U know better
1340 2018-07-04 21:48:10 Once more, showing how stupid you are.  Crude oil as the raw material, is less than 10% of the end cost of gasoline.
1341 2018-07-04 21:48:08 Sigh.  The price of oil is determined by the global market.  The unrest that Trump created in Iran and Israel are responsible for the raise in oil prices.  Further adding that Iran is currently producing oil, but once the sanctions start, it will cause a shortage.
1342 2018-07-04 21:48:06 @No oil.
1343 2018-07-04 21:48:02 Venezuela has been tacked on because it's on trumps list for invasion..they have alot of oil so trump is going to steal it
1344 2018-07-04 21:47:41 Iran could reduce its co-operation with the U.N. nuclear watchdog, President Hassan Rouhani told the body's head on Wednesday, after he warned U.S. President Donald Trump of "consequences" of fresh sanctions against Iranian oil sales.

Such accurate info. And some known investors. I wonder if they were seasoned twitter rampers.

1348 2018-07-04 21:47:28 36 sprints in the pits at Can- Am tonight.  Thanks for the continued support of the Lucas Oil Empire Super Sprints.
1349 2018-07-04 21:47:26 Nah, to much maintenance and oil.
1350 2018-07-04 21:47:00 He has graduated from snake oil to snake venom! This man could literally sell poisonous snake venom and call them vitamins, and his base would believe him...and take them every day. And they wouldn’t blame him when their hair starts falling out and they’re dying.
1351 2018-07-04 21:46:57 rules and single go together like oil and water
1352 2018-07-04 21:46:55 America Needs an IMPORT Tariff on Foreign Oil to PREVENT OPEC from Preditory Pricing Prices used to prevent America from becoming Energy Self-Sufficient.  America must have Price floor to prevent this. $65 or $70 per barrel FLOOR would enable us to be weaned from OPEC oil.
1353 2018-07-04 21:46:54 More
I hope the fishermen have learned about not trusting a Tory, Michael Gove said WE will have control of our waters  WE will decide who catches the fish meaning Tory's  will have control, so remember that word WE. Never trust a Tory  Tory's WE will control oil.
1354 2018-07-04 21:46:37 Idiot-- they have leverage you don't. You are trying to get rid of alternative sources of energy-- that is why they charge less for oil, because we hold their economies in our hands with buying oil. You blew it.
1355 2018-07-04 21:46:30 And what if they don’t? All your oil Buddies will just make more money.
1356 2018-07-04 21:46:29 Magid, Big fan. One Question: Do you get an oil painting like the ones behind you and if so will it be in Sheffield Town Hall forever?
1357 2018-07-04 21:46:23 I did my own version of the newcastle diet but on 1200kcal/day then after I lost 35kg I reverted to a med style diet without the oil. that was about 8years ago never put weight on and never been above 33hba1c since then. caught it early
1358 2018-07-04 21:46:21 Thanks for admitting that all the recent wars that United States has been involved in are really about oil Donald Trump.
1359 2018-07-04 21:46:19 Duncecap Donald: You know nothing of business, do you? You ask Saudi Arabia to increase their oil production.  Now, you whine to OPEC.  Keep your hands off! You do enough damage at home with your paranoid lies. Tragic!
1360 2018-07-04 21:46:15 The US fuel prices should have ZERO influence from OPEC! We don’t rely on their oil. It’s time to break that reliance on them once and for all.
1361 2018-07-04 21:46:08 Can't be cool when hot oil in de mix.
1362 2018-07-04 21:46:07 So damn stupid he threw water on a oil fire 
1363 2018-07-04 21:46:03 How's things in Russia? Did Trump "talk" you into supporting his desire to lift the sanctions on Russia? Did he promise you a cut in the oil production, that he'll be getting rewarded for helping get out of the country? Did Putin promise to help make KS voter fraud less obvious?
1364 2018-07-04 21:45:53 There are also no sanctions on oil that have been applied by trump. Only the previous sanctions that were in place before the deal.
1365 2018-07-04 21:45:47 How ‘bout drilling in the good oil’ USA? How about putting the good oil drilling folks in Bradford, PA to work?
1366 2018-07-04 21:45:43 America government should come to Biafra land and take our gas for 50 years free and support our freedom , our lives are more value and important to us than oil and gas in Biafra land in 200 years to come
1367 2018-07-04 21:45:40 Putting on sunblock for me is like a normal person putting on tanning oil lol
1368 2018-07-04 21:45:34 Monopoly? What about Russia, Norway, Mexico, Canada, Brazil and, uh, the US? All of whom export oil, none of whom are in OPEC.
1369 2018-07-04 21:45:33 When Trump pops up to Scotland he’s gonna get battered. And, yes... I mean deep fried in hot oil and served with chips and sauce. #DeepFriedCheeto
1370 2018-07-04 21:45:27 Besides a shitload of oil?
1371 2018-07-04 21:45:08 GOOD FATS: Avocado, Fish, Almonds, Walnuts, Peanuts, Cashews, Olive Oil, Coconut Oil, Seeds, Coconut, Olives, Peanut Butter, Low-Fat Dairy
1372 2018-07-04 21:45:06 Do you not understand the whole reason for OPEC? It's to control the price of oil for its members. They limited supply to use up the surplus so the price would go up. This is where they want the prices to be.
1373 2018-07-04 21:45:05 That is an interesting question. How come oil companies don’t have to pay property taxes for the severed mineral rights on the same land the surface rights owners pay taxes on? Seems like someone is getting away with something there.
1374 2018-07-04 21:45:00 Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Wednesday that Tehran will stand firm against US threats to cut Iranian #oil sales, and warned that Washington had not thought about the consequences of such a decision.
1375 2018-07-04 21:44:46 Coffee coffee grinds, 1 tablespoon of olive oil, 1/2 of coconut oil, 1 table spoon of sea salt, a couple drops of lavender for spell and 2 table spoons of vitamin e oil
1376 2018-07-04 21:44:45 Trump wants Venezuela OIL!!!! Not their Refugee!!! He & Pruitt want the OIL!!!!!! OIL OIL OIL!!!
1377 2018-07-04 21:44:45 Which kind of potato salad? The one with mayo or the one with olive oil. Only one kind is allowed or Brenda will be pissed.
1378 2018-07-04 21:44:44 Because they own the oil, gas, and coal companies.
1379 2018-07-04 21:44:38 Ha. CBD oil allegedly doesn’t get you stoned. Sorry to disappoint.
1380 2018-07-04 21:44:33 Yes as wine via 3 companies around the globe....my oil no.I used to but expensive. All pre sold locally before harvest.
1381 2018-07-04 21:44:26 And who needs oil when you have so much "clean" coal 
1382 2018-07-04 21:44:12 Donald your right again nobody I know can figure it out why it cost so much ? They just got a custom to do it after tragedy no they just greedy no reason for gas to be so high there plenty of oil
1383 2018-07-04 21:44:07 Threatening the OPEC Nations doesn't seem a smart bet. They can just as easily start producing far less oil for a bit. POTUS might not be able to fly anywhere or ride in that gas guzzling limousine. Keep complaining Trump, keep tellin the Arabic Nations how to run their business
1384 2018-07-04 21:44:04 Well since US oil production is up to 10 Mbps - up from 4 in 2006.  We can sell some of the national reserve oil - or say we will, that should stabilize and reduce the oil price - say in the 60-65 range.
1385 2018-07-04 21:44:03 "it was a queer, sultry summer, the summer they electrocuted the rosenbergs, and i didn’t know what i was doing in new york... and this was so yummy omg first you combine the oil and lemon juice..." - literally every online recipe for kale salad JUST GET TO THE POINT ALREADY
1386 2018-07-04 21:43:57 Trump is to blame for the oil prices. Should have kept going on the renewable energy path instead of the 1970s dependence on oil.
1387 2018-07-04 21:43:56 Meant to write "Hillary URANIUM for Russian dough scheme".  (Must be thinking about making some pizza with oil & dough... ;)
1388 2018-07-04 21:43:55 Or you know, we could stop relying on oil and start investing in Nuclear, wind, and solar power, as well as electric vehicles so that we can cut our economic dependence on fossil fuels entirely.
1389 2018-07-04 21:43:53 When it's time for me to go I will definitely do that bitch because am not jobless. Need to supply my goods tomorrow  ask wilson solive oil Nigeria what they're do in there. Fool am not your mate. I'm better than you. At least now am taking good care of my family .
1390 2018-07-04 21:43:52 Looking like a winter of #RipOff Fuel WTI oil sitting at $75 a barrel and rising over Iran sanctions. Who will feel it worst those living on  #UniversalCredit #WorkingClass #PublicTransport Time to embrace renewable energy
1391 2018-07-04 21:43:52 Why are you complaining. The USA has enough oil production to supply itself and plus sell off shore. Stop complaining about OPEC do the right thing. Oh, I forgot you have no idea what the right thing is.
1392 2018-07-04 21:43:45 Yeah, oil now giving him the double finger, DJT, isn't a happy camper.

1403 2018-07-04 21:42:38 Trump wants Venezuela OIL!!!!! Invading that country for Pruitt & US Oil Companies....He doesn't care about the Refugees from Venezuela!!!! OIL!!!
1404 2018-07-04 21:42:38 The N.Y. Times had a huge story on Hillary's oil for Russian dough scheme: "Cash Flowed to Clinton Foundation Amid Russian Uranium Deal" 4/23/15  Excerpt: "Among the agencies that eventually signed off was the State Dpt, then headed by Mr. Clinton's wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton."
1405 2018-07-04 21:42:36 2 /2 History repeats: every time OUR Industry recovers from the BUST Period (which was Strategically caused by Saudi flooding the Oil markets) then they (Saudi) they Flood the market again and Bankrupt America's Domestic Exploration Companies.

1407 2018-07-04 21:42:32 Hmmm....You mean the price of oil Isn't controlled by Trump?

1410 2018-07-04 21:42:15 We need to kick the oil habit. Until then, why is no one working to refine the product in Canada? No toxic bitumen to export and you keep the value added jobs here. Pipeline just export jobs.
1411 2018-07-04 21:42:15 Hey @realDonaldTrump it's called economics

Actions have consequences.  Pulled out of Iran deal, prices go up duh!

OPEC sets output, global market sets price.

Helps Russia though, a top oil exporter now making millions more

Idiot helps Russia  sad

1415 2018-07-04 21:42:05 Then frack your land! Oil leeching big block engine half truck driving dummies. Oil is not an endless resource and we should all think about reducing the co2 emissions, together. THIS IS OUR PLANET AND WE SHARE IT!
1416 2018-07-04 21:42:03 Re-regulate the oil industry sir!  A quart of oil should not cost $3 !!

1417 2018-07-04 21:41:58 Yes. But you might have known Palm oil itself is not bad. The use is just discouraged because of ecological reasons.

They produce the oil they can charge us whatever they want Nixon went through it do you have to sit there and realize you're not the king of the world
1423 2018-07-04 21:41:34 Hey genius...why do you think Obama was into renewable energy sources. Notice the correlation between gas prices and our lack of dependence on foreign oil?  As soon as you dissed renewables, you sent a signal to the world telling them to raise oil prices. Can we play poker soon?
1424 2018-07-04 21:41:34 Nah more like muh no oil to run the tanks
1425 2018-07-04 21:41:20 As if crude oil prices never fluctuate?.  Get a life!

1436 2018-07-04 21:40:52 You single handedly caused all this Fat Nixon. Oil prices rose when you got out of the Iran deal. You aren’t very smart are you?
1437 2018-07-04 21:40:52 Ive been forgetting to take my fish oil pills, and leg day did a number on my knees.
1438 2018-07-04 21:40:48 1. OPEC doesn't have a monopoly on oil production.
2. You made noise earlier about how we should have just kept Iran's oil.
3. Now there's talk you're thinking of invading Venezuela (for their oil?).
4. You're not big enough to be king of the world, Donnie Boy.
1439 2018-07-04 21:40:39 Why do you allow US producers to send oil around the world?  Why not keep that oil at home?  USA could have the lowest gas prices while the rest of the world deals with undersupply.
1440 2018-07-04 21:40:38 Yup. You’re right. Just like he said he would have taken Iraq’s oil as the spoils of war.
1441 2018-07-04 21:40:35 Oil prices just going up since election, and that’s exactly what Putin needs to happen for his own pockets......
1442 2018-07-04 21:40:33 Go ahead and get OPEC reducing oil prices. I don’t think your way of threatening helps

1460 2018-07-04 21:39:36 Oil companies have the confidence to invest because they believe OPEC would eventually provide a floor. Without OPEC, investments in oil production will be lower. As an oil trader a market without OPEC would be much easier to benefit from. But the consumers would be hit big time
1461 2018-07-04 21:39:33 Math is hard, and @IvankaTrump can’t think her way out of her own shitty clothes on the tjmaxx clearance rack, much less understand how oil & international diplomacy are linked.

1465 2018-07-04 21:39:22 Gas prices are up. Please Mr. President, don't blame OPEC or others, blame yourself posing restrictions on Iran a huge oil producer is thrown out from the International market causes shortage of oil subsequently price goes high.

1470 2018-07-04 21:38:45 Gasoline is already the cheapest liquid on the planet! (Even when ignoring the national average 48.4 Cents at the pump “HIDDEN excise tax”). Even bottled water is $5 to $24/gallon!  Just The "hidden" Excise Tax alone amounts to 2-3x's the TOTAL Profits of Big Oil.

1472 2018-07-04 21:38:37 How about we drill for our own oil for a change....?
1473 2018-07-04 21:38:31 What about getting that Iranian oil?? Oh, wait. Never mind!!
1474 2018-07-04 21:38:27 Yeah the managed to leave something, that is oil based washes away with rain.
And it survived for several months.

Wonder if they track Porton Down staff and visitors
1475 2018-07-04 21:38:24 You're right, we need to quit farm subsidies, bank bailouts and subsidies to oil companies.
1476 2018-07-04 21:38:07 First we need to get DJT to stop tweeting about OPEC/high oil prices...
1477 2018-07-04 21:38:05 For soup, cook diced leek in oil, then simmer with tempeh, red curry paste, coconut milk and bean sprouts. Top with basil.
1478 2018-07-04 21:37:57 Don't we have oil producers in this country that you should be begging to increase production? Why are you encouraging another country to bail your ego out?

1480 2018-07-04 21:37:52 You could release some from the oil reserves and that will lower prices .
1481 2018-07-04 21:37:35 And be well within my caloric range for my size according to the stabdard fir calories in and calories out.

In fact THAT is kinda the thought process i had when i became diabetic and weighed 225 pounds at 4 foot 10.

In today's standard sugar/grains/seed oil laden society its BS
1482 2018-07-04 21:37:32 We steal your oil and brig cheos FUCK YEA!!!
Wait is that in the text ?
1483 2018-07-04 21:37:20 Wow. You are just incredibly stupid. OPEC does not have a monopoly on the oil market nor do they set prices.
1484 2018-07-04 21:37:15 Y me acuerdo q esa misma gente del sur q peleaba x sus subsidios le parecía , casi un privilegio de clase q se subdidie el gas oil en la Pampa humeda.Somos un país donde cada uno se rasca para adentro.
1485 2018-07-04 21:37:11 Have you ever thought that maybe oil and gasoline just are no longer sustainable? As a leader you should be willing to drop our dependence on foreign nations and seek other forms of energy that will propel us in further maintaining our dominance.
1486 2018-07-04 21:37:11 "the United States defends many of their members for very little $’s." He is the "nickel and dime" president, and a bully...nice oil rigs you got there, be a shame if we stopped protecting them.
1487 2018-07-04 21:37:10 Produce more domestic oil & reduce buying from OPEC.USA can control price rather than the Arabs.Keep CASH here

1489 2018-07-04 21:36:58 Just provide freedom to more countries that have oil, simply solution, you know the saying, do what you're good at.
1490 2018-07-04 21:36:56 And the other half? Oil, coal or nucleair? And what happens during night with less wind and stil energy needed? So wind and sun is only additional!
1491 2018-07-04 21:36:46 Understanding of geopolitics by @EFFSouthAfrica is the issue here. Supply of oil has been constrained by the ban of Libya to supply. That standard 8 economics graph which indicates the relationship between supply, demand and price is still relevant to analyse these increases.
1492 2018-07-04 21:36:35 You really know nothing about oil production do ya?
1493 2018-07-04 21:36:27 Trump talking about invading Venezuela? One word," OIL OIL, OIL". See that Scott Pruitt? Trump wants Nothing to do with "Refugees" from Venezuela, so in our "Isolationist USA" is Trump, suddenly even Know where that Country is ...EXXON, CHEVRON, BP?????
1494 2018-07-04 21:36:26 It is time to drill for oil in Ontario!
1495 2018-07-04 21:36:21 If OPEC did not exist oil prices would be higher. OPEC actually reduces oil price volatility. It stops prices from going too low and bankrupting a big portion of the oil industry in a bear cycle. It smoothes the boom/bust cycle. Be careful what you wish for
1496 2018-07-04 21:36:11 Rich Hall's 'Working for the American Dream' is a great critique of the snake oil world of politics and corporate philosophy - both fancy rhetoric that aim to obfuscate inherent inequality, and to depict victims of circumstance as the only authors of their own misfortune

1498 2018-07-04 21:36:03 The value of the dollar is down 14% since 2016. That's called inflation. OPEC has to charge more for oil in order to keep its profits up or keep them rising. Put another way, it takes more devalued dollars for OPEC to make the same profit margin it was making in 2016. Econ 101.
1499 2018-07-04 21:35:51 We have enough oil in our own country, so maybe we should be self su, instead of this
1500 2018-07-04 21:35:46 I've been training for 2 years as a Privateer for when we go in and take the oil.

What the hell is this?

(OK, so mainly it's been watching 'Captain Ron' and making Rum Drinks, but I figure that would make me the most qualified Trump employee for commandeering Oil Tankers.)
1501 2018-07-04 21:35:45 Let us also take note that the selling of those reserves is the reason why oil price went to $74 a barrel in amatter of 3 weeks neh?
1502 2018-07-04 21:35:41 Ur so stupid. If we had renewable energy sources we wouldn't care about their oil !!!
1503 2018-07-04 21:35:38 Regularly gargle with salted water or coconut oil. Ginger tea helps, too.
1504 2018-07-04 21:35:38 The @liberal_party ’s TransMountain pipeline purchase has the unmistakable sense of foolish money chasing merely unwise money. The unwise money belongs to Canadian banks who bought the stranded Alberta assets of multinational oil companies. The foolish money belongs to Canadians.
1505 2018-07-04 21:35:36 @BehrPaint Are you discontinuing your BEHR PREMIUM® Transparent Penetrating Oil Wood Finish?  I can't find it anywhere and a local HD told me it was no longer being made.
1506 2018-07-04 21:35:33 ..and what do Norway have an abundance of that we don't? Oil. We are a completly different economy and yes we would be a satellite, we would be exactly that. On the periphery.
1507 2018-07-04 21:35:32 One word:

Oil
1508 2018-07-04 21:35:32 Anyway high time oil price goes up.....your voter will give u hell for this
1509 2018-07-04 21:35:30 This is an attempt to make it pay without -- we need people to be working from every angle. That way, something functional would be in place if & when *all* subsidies (all corporate and 'crony', anyway) are removed.

But yes, stop subsidizing Big Ag and Big Oil (et al), NOW.
1510 2018-07-04 21:35:24 When you believe a snake oil salesman, people end up hurting and dissappointed.
1511 2018-07-04 21:35:24 Quit exporting OUR oil then!
1512 2018-07-04 21:35:20 You do realize if you would support renewable energy instead of coal and oil it would eliminate demand and opec price controls effectively bringing down prices st the pump for Americans. Try that approach instead of waving your finger at opec. But what do I know.
1513 2018-07-04 21:35:18 suka betol bau tea tree oil ni. 
1514 2018-07-04 21:35:12 Oh, that's what that is!? I thought it was a menu full of my favourite meat! I was about to place an order!
1515 2018-07-04 21:35:12 Great piss off OPEC & they may cut oil production and higher gas prices. You really don’t know economics @realDonaldTrump
1516 2018-07-04 21:35:08 Do you happen to know what percentage of oil is converted to solid and used for plastic like things circled in her photo vs what percentage is lit on fire as a fuel?
1517 2018-07-04 21:35:03 Today my dad told me I’m an independent woman who don’t need no man....as he put oil in my car for me because the hood always gets my hands dirty and I don’t like thaaaaaaat
1518 2018-07-04 21:35:00 NOOOOOOO!!  You’re killing OUR oil industry in LA & TX!! @qanon76
1519 2018-07-04 21:34:43 A pan-galactic GOP- blaster: Absinthe, hash oil, and just enough puffer-fish neuro-toxin that you can't tell the difference between Barack Obama and Donald Trump.
1520 2018-07-04 21:34:39 I think it relates to sanctions against Iran. Closing off Iran's oil exports and access to $'s to motivate regime change. I do not think Iran has a lot of friends in OPEC. The U.S. is blockading Iran to OPEC's benefit. He expects them to ease supply pressure.
1521 2018-07-04 21:34:38 OIL Spill Dispersant Type-II Manufacturer & Exporters in Khorfakkan, Ras Al Khaimah, Sharjah, Dubai, Jebel Ali, Abu Dhabi Port...
1522 2018-07-04 21:34:37 Booming economies drive oil demand for energy and transport. What happened to oil prices after 2008 crash? How stupid are you?
1523 2018-07-04 21:34:31 I have watched numerous town halls from Canada, read the news. From the US it seems Alberta is basicly the equivalent of our southern states: tends towards unapologetic racism toward indigenous & immigrants + insistence on oil dependency.  Not all, but a disproportionate amount.
1524 2018-07-04 21:34:26 When you're watching fireworks tonight, make sure you remember that Americans kill middle eastern children for oil
1525 2018-07-04 21:34:24 The incumbent government paid debts and liabilities dating back to 1991 in oil bust while the former had to borrow to pay salaries in oil boom. 
Argue with facts.
1526 2018-07-04 21:34:21 Was he biting the midnight oil as well? Poor bastard.
1527 2018-07-04 21:34:13 Oil is about 2 tank @prrobbins  sssshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
1528 2018-07-04 21:34:08 Another example is a study the American heart association did that said soybean oil is good for you. Of course this was AFTER soybean growers association gave AHA a huge donation
1529 2018-07-04 21:34:06 This reminds me of people in Chicago getting disgusted at portillos using mayonnaise for cake as if mayo isn’t just eggs and oil (cake ingredients anyway)
1530 2018-07-04 21:34:06 Have a good feeling about the oil market going up tomorrow, ‘tis America’s borthday after all
1531 2018-07-04 21:33:58 ONGC se crude oil pee kar aata hai Sambit Patra daily. Issliye bhanraas bhaunk kar nikaalta hai.
1532 2018-07-04 21:33:56 One thing for sure we have oil everywhere.... big oil has screwed the world for years.... time for electric cars and solar.... Send Big oil packing....
1533 2018-07-04 21:33:47 So Russia can take over oil production there?
1534 2018-07-04 21:33:41 I just still think it's incredible seeing headlines like "Oil prices fell after President Trump tweeted..."
WHAT IS MORE POWERFUL THE PEN OR THE SWORD? IT'S THE TWEET MY D00DZ.
1535 2018-07-04 21:33:39 I love how Donny shows me new ways to be stupid every day.  Does he not know that USA defends oil producers to help ensure supply continuity and price moderation?  If he pulls the defence, the prices will go through the roof.  The man's a complete donut.
1536 2018-07-04 21:33:34 Yuppy Love on #Gold. One of the best Only Fools ever. Rodney meeting Cassandra, Del making a killing on Olive Oil, how do you spell  'Arrods? Trigger talking about money to the women. Seen one of them old fivers. Del falling though the Bar and Rod getting left off miles from home
1537 2018-07-04 21:33:33 Hemp oil!
1538 2018-07-04 21:33:32 You must have the memory of a goldfish. Gas prices were way higher during Obama years. 3.60+ a gallon. Then the oil market crashed, remember all the frackers going out of business? And a booming economy drives oil demand.
Not to mention Trump and Saudis are working together on it
1539 2018-07-04 21:33:26 Do you even understand how oil is priced?
1540 2018-07-04 21:33:24 Don't the US have oil reserves we can use to bring gas prices down?
@realDonaldTrump
1541 2018-07-04 21:33:23 The US is a net exporter of oil.  OPEC production has no impact on US oil prices. US oil producers match OPEC prices to maximise profit. Trump invests in oil. Trump is making money from high gas prices but looks to blame OPEC. trump lies.
1542 2018-07-04 21:33:20 Them: "Respect the troops, they died for your right to launch fireworks!"

Vets: "Actually could you maybe not launch those? See we have PTSD from fighting over oil and-"

Them: "WOOHOO, FREEDOM! *lights all the fuses at once*"
1543 2018-07-04 21:33:15 We do all our oil contracts with Saudi Arabia after we broke up OPEC!!!! We are the monopoly, President Trump. We have a huge resovoir of oil in our country (more than the Middle East). Just ask Texas, California, and Alaska, just to name a few!
1544 2018-07-04 21:33:12 make up/oil from your skin getting in your eyes ? i have this a lot bc of my dry eyes so that would be an option too x
1545 2018-07-04 21:33:11 To heck with them!  Impose a 10% tariff on all imports (including oil) and ELIMINATE the corporate income tax!  Domestic production will increase and fill the need.  Stop sending money to the Middle East. @AFPhq @DiamondandSilk @TroyCoby @BreitbartNews @FoxBusiness
1546 2018-07-04 21:33:07 About time we play hardball with the Middle East oil producers. We are a check against Iran taking things over. We need some sort of “thank you” for that protection!!
1547 2018-07-04 21:33:03 According to news reports Russia can take control of many dams & municipal water systems of our creeky crumbling 100+ yrs old infrastructure. Lead in Flint Mich. water ain't nothing compared to what could be done to US water (aside from fracking gas/oil)
1548 2018-07-04 21:33:01 the average person on the street has not thought about Susan Sarandon since Lorenzo's Oil
1549 2018-07-04 21:33:00 Cancel all transfer payments to Quebec until they buy Canadian oil.
1550 2018-07-04 21:32:46 Hilton says your hotels are too expensive are you going to lower the prices?
OPEC....Their oil...their prices...
1551 2018-07-04 21:32:42 Need a chopper to fly in some veg oil for traction.
1552 2018-07-04 21:32:38 So, everyone can go back a few days & find his tweet on how he spoke to OPEC and they were going to increase production so prices would come down. Big fat lie, and he was caught telling it. His rep cronies in oil are raking in millions; why would he want prices to drop? Criminal.
1553 2018-07-04 21:32:38 People Pray For The Cake. Then God Gives Them The Batter, Eggs, Oil, Icing, Pan, & Oven, They Get Frustrated And Leave The Kitchen. 

Sometimes You Have Everything Right In Front Of You But How Bad Do You Want It?
1554 2018-07-04 21:32:32 Thanks to your legislation, Mr President, the ANWR is open for drilling and KeystoneXL is completed.  Between our own reserves of oil & gas - being judiciously developed - our tapping of wind & sun, and of course our coal, my industry has made US energy independent. 
1555 2018-07-04 21:32:23 EU more likely to "appropriate the oil revenues to spend in the EU.
1556 2018-07-04 21:32:20 Snake oil trainer
1557 2018-07-04 21:32:18 John, any concept of how things are different from Washington time to 2018? Got any snake oil for to treat cancer? That argument u offered is void of reality for these times
1558 2018-07-04 21:32:14 I'm fighting my "family history". I refuse to believe I'm going to fall into the lines of my family. I've been blessed with health and physical strength. I'm thankful and grateful everyday! I'm about to start taking CBD oil. I want to be an old lady surrounded by my grandkids.
1559 2018-07-04 21:32:10 Nope, he said what he meant and he meant what he said. He would love to invade Venezuela and take their oil.
1560 2018-07-04 21:32:09 No dotard.  You lie. Oil prices are up because you trashed the Iran deal.  This did a few things among them it helped Putin because his oil is now more valuable and it also helped Saudi Arabia and American oil companies.  Who got hurt? That's right American working people @AP
1561 2018-07-04 21:31:47 Wallstreet is make the money not opec wake up! A barrel of oil is the same price as it was in the 80's
Dont blame opec   blame corporat greed.
1562 2018-07-04 21:31:45 Lol 4th of July ruined thanks to allegiant airlines. Flight 101 Cedar Rapids to PHX filled up with smoke from an oil leak and had to land. Sat in a hot smoke filled plane for 45 minutes before we finally got off. 7 hour delay to get on the next flight...
1563 2018-07-04 21:31:45 It’s your fault oil prices are up
1564 2018-07-04 21:31:45 ....and therefore they should help the US with lower oil prices? That makes sense, but the tweet is a bit hard to parse
1565 2018-07-04 21:31:37 This is why Putin is already paying Muduro millions $ in exchange for oil rights to the richest offshore supply of oil in the world.
1566 2018-07-04 21:31:27 My dear, e pass discipline oh..... Because devil go dey make the dodo shine asif e pass ordinary oil
1567 2018-07-04 21:31:12 We can always use our own oil.. how would they like that.
1568 2018-07-04 21:31:10 The Bitchin Camaro is really starting to show its age, like its owner. Going through oil and coolant way too much
1569 2018-07-04 21:31:09 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, or benefits magnet.
1570 2018-07-04 21:31:08 The cantilever counteracts the force of gravity ,thats why its at equilibrium
1571 2018-07-04 21:31:06 They owe us nothing. They benefit from high oil prices. And they know that you can do nothing about it. So don't expect any sympathy from them. After all, you've done nothing to deserve it.
1572 2018-07-04 21:31:01 OPEC is a cartel (not a monopoly), and members produce about 44% of total crude oil production. Price is related to supply & demand. US pull-out from Iran nuke deal reduces supply. What happens to price?
1573 2018-07-04 21:30:56 You have no idea how this works do you. U.S. does not import much of the oil produced in the Middle East. If you want lower gasoline prices, put pressure on your friends at Shell and Exxon.
1574 2018-07-04 21:30:48 sksidje always check when ur sunscreen/tanning oil expires bc it will give u 3rd degree burns if ur not careful
1575 2018-07-04 21:30:42 Intervention and seize the spoils of war....the Venezuelan oil production.
1576 2018-07-04 21:30:42 Come on people @realDonaldTrump will do anything to get some oil!
1577 2018-07-04 21:30:38 Of course. There’s oil there
1578 2018-07-04 21:30:35 I'm sure you live there rent free.AND in Germany's case I'm sure they contribute to your running costs for presence.The Saudi's definitely pay you as do UAE. OIL probably high to pay YOUR costs. Face it your ALL gorging out of the same trough. #commonman #conman #MAGA #forreal ?
1579 2018-07-04 21:30:32 U are screwing us with tariffs and high oil prices stop this

1581 2018-07-04 21:30:24 Actually, gas prices are down, and the US is the largest EXPORTER in the world. We don't need OPEC. Keep domestic oil here at home to keep prices stable.

What fantasy dimension do you exist in?

Lying idiot!
1582 2018-07-04 21:30:17 おはよう。二度寝したら追いオリーブだぞ。
1583 2018-07-04 21:30:16 Sorry they have the oil they win. We aren’t in a position to do anything but complain. When Obama was POTUS you blamed him. Welcome to being POTUS.
1584 2018-07-04 21:30:15 I thought you said you got the Saudi Prince to release 2 million barrels of oil.  So I guess that was BS..
1585 2018-07-04 21:30:08 i think this oil ramp is tied into china weakening the usd.cnh what's to stop them from selling unlimited cnh to buy usd's that are recycled into oil?  nothing that i can think of.  the price action isn't normal "investing" its an endless bid algo.
1586 2018-07-04 21:30:04 We don’t have a shortage of oil. Gas prices do not need to be this high. Big oil making some of the largest profits they’ve ever made. Why? Try Republicans
1587 2018-07-04 21:30:04 You fool.... why would they help lower prices??? The only way is to become less dependent on the oil.  YOU ARE NOT SMART... JUST AN OLD FOOL.
1588 2018-07-04 21:30:01 O trouxa deu o que árabes queriam(encilhar IRÃ) e manter floor alto para OIL. Putin tá adorando e árabes dando risada enquanto contam curtem até aumentarem produção para enrolar o otario mais um pouco.
1589 2018-07-04 21:29:44 Please help. I just watched wubby drink baby oil. I wanna die.

1591 2018-07-04 21:29:39 so i have never el7amdellah suffered from a sunburn my entire life except last year when i used this weird tanning oil which i discovered today expired in 2013 that wasn’t a sunburn that was an actual burn
1592 2018-07-04 21:29:39 Cant wait to get back on the cannabis oil tomorrow. Cant cope with having sore hands every night for any longer 
1593 2018-07-04 21:29:37 Saudi Arabia. Aren't they your good buddies. You don't give a crap about us. "Saudi Arabia - Opec: 12 oil barons who control the world's energy supply. Ali bin Ibrahim al-Naimi, Saudi Arabia's Minister of Petroleum & Natural Resources, is the most powerful voice within Opec."
1594 2018-07-04 21:29:29 I am boycotting Que. dairy and Que. period. Trudeau sold the country and auto industry for his real homeland. Buy Alberta oil!
1595 2018-07-04 21:29:28 But your drilling for,oil all@over and that clean coal man we should have gas at 19 cents
1596 2018-07-04 21:29:14 You can’t put oil in your household collection!
1597 2018-07-04 21:29:13 at least one article i've read states that THC is toxic to dogs, and CBD oil's derived from organic hemp are the best way to ensure it's safe.
1598 2018-07-04 21:29:12 @bubblywums can you please make it so you can’t lock oil pumps on pve. It’s a bunch of crap that one tribes takes all the nodes and had them all locked for only themselves
1599 2018-07-04 21:29:09 I thought we didn't need Arab Oil anymore?
Disgraceful tweet to post on  Independence Day, you cur.
1600 2018-07-04 21:29:05 Opec is not monopoly, the only suplier. Other supliers like US, Canada, UK, Norway... So more like a cartel of large suppliers that largely can influence the market.
Other influences are limiting other suppliers (Venezuela., Iran) to sell their oil and gas. Fix that disruption

1602 2018-07-04 21:28:55 In 1940 there was essentially a choice between two options:
Face a Nazi invasion of the USSR immediately without France and Britain on your side since this is the phoney war period.
Give some grain and oil and update the navy, air, and industry.
You're for noble suicide I see.
1603 2018-07-04 21:28:50 So whats new DT. Did you just wake up? OPEC knows we cant live without them so whats your solution? Lets put tariffs on oil to make Americans pay more for gas. Most of the price of gas are taxes so lower taxes.
1604 2018-07-04 21:28:46 It tells me that there are plenty of smoking hot, good men just waiting for that perfect traditional-conservative woman with whom to fall in love, get married and have lots of conservative babies who grow up to vote.
1605 2018-07-04 21:28:44 top tip: when it’s hot outside, don’t put baby oil on after your morning shower to keep your skin moisturised, you will burn 
1606 2018-07-04 21:28:43 Getting oil prices up is literally OPEC’s purpose. Led by your buddies Saudi and Russia. And you are taking Iran’s oil off the market.
1607 2018-07-04 21:28:43 You ppl r just so careless while trying to condemn things,pls research about that before coming to that kind of conclusion, if it had any connection of your allegations I'll b the first to bring it up.
Not every time we bring un necessary meanings to things.
1608 2018-07-04 21:28:31 Invade Venezuela and keep their oil.
It is better than Maduro for sure,they are dying of hunger 
I don't think is a bad idea someone put a halt to their abuse
TAKE VENEZUELA and we can go to their beaches. 

1609 2018-07-04 21:28:27 Tell that to Exxon, Shell and the rest of the oil companies that are making record profits.
1610 2018-07-04 21:28:26 You are ordering OPEC to reduce their prices? You just said four days ago that King Salman of Saudi Arabia agreed to sending an additional 2,000,000 barrels of oil? What happened to that? Or was that yet again more Trump lies? You simply cannot be relied upon to TELL THE TRUTH!
1611 2018-07-04 21:28:24 That's what women say 
Surfing the red wave, or crimson tide.
Red just like China and Russia.
And all the blood spilled on this earth. 
For oil.
1612 2018-07-04 21:28:18 Kangin get confused about what to teach Kyu,
because once Kyu incorrectly entered oil when
cooking a simple ham.
1613 2018-07-04 21:28:13 Your boss Putin wants higher oil prices.  This Tweet is just a stupid diversion.
1614 2018-07-04 21:28:10 You are correct that Saudis, Emaratis, Kuwaitis must compensate US for protection they are receiving. It looks like you want more than $250 billion they pour into the US economy.  In terms of oil prices,  don't you believe in capitalism?
1615 2018-07-04 21:28:10 He literally does everything to stop the Economy,like on purpose...destabilize ME,tariffs for the rest.....high oil prices and trade barriers hurt everybody !
1616 2018-07-04 21:28:05 Yeah right what do you think effing with the Iran deal does!? Oil corporations don't back GOP for $30 oil they do it for $140 oil GOP has been causing problems with middle East oil producing nations since the Yom Kippur war
1617 2018-07-04 21:28:05 I thought the Saudi king promised you he would pump more oil?  Since THAT didn’t work, I’m sure your tweet will. Oh, and that thing you killed with Iran (Iran nuclear treaty)? Yeah, that didn’t help either. #FuckingMoron
1618 2018-07-04 21:28:00 Christ is great.... and oil will go to 300$ just because of his idiocy....

She's a snake oil saleswoman. 
#NoBrexitFudge
1620 2018-07-04 21:27:54 Or we could focus on fuel efficiency and alternative fuels to reduce ours dependence on oil (foreign or domestic). The side benefits also include reduce environmental impacts, financial independence and better health for our citizens. Try leading us forward rather than backwards.
1621 2018-07-04 21:27:39 It's extortion. He's implying that, if the Saudis fail to produce sufficient oil to manage down prices, the US might not ally with them militarily. Conducting foreign policy via twitter is Presidential malpractice.
1622 2018-07-04 21:27:35 @realDonaldTrump opec and you have zero to do with gas prices. It is determined by futures traders  pricing oil well into the future.
1623 2018-07-04 21:27:22 Can't your friend King Salman of Saudi Arabia fix this?  I mean he already agreed to increase his production of oil, to counter our consumption?
1624 2018-07-04 21:27:22 Ok, if yall want higher oil prices just regime  change saudis !  LMAO  THEN ILL BE BULLISH  
1625 2018-07-04 21:27:19 One more thing he doesn’t understand ... world oil markets!
1626 2018-07-04 21:27:19  Mind you my boss once gave her little girl a Olbas Oil infused tissue when there was no toilet paper

1628 2018-07-04 21:27:18 Didn't tweet last week that you had the Saudis lowering oil prices? Guess that was another lie.
1629 2018-07-04 21:27:02 Nope but they are part of that whole OPEC Alliance. And because of that Iran is limiting their oil production in turn causing pricesto rise.
1630 2018-07-04 21:27:02 Darling,
My tactical vest hasn't arrived from Wish yet, though the essential oils have. I figure that thieves' oil will be enough to keep the army of red hats away. I'm not sure how I will be able to carry all of the vials w/ me at the Battle of Starbucks.  #SecondCivilWarLetters
1631 2018-07-04 21:26:59 Oil went up 10.00 a barrel the day you canceled the Iran deal.
1632 2018-07-04 21:26:59 When it’s all said and done the entirety of the carbon tax will fall on Alberta and Saskatchewan oil.
1633 2018-07-04 21:26:50 Does it have Olive Oil on it as well?
1634 2018-07-04 21:26:39 The Saudis needed higher oil prices. Trump accommodated. Just like China needed more jobs. Trump accommodated China too
1635 2018-07-04 21:26:37 @McDonalds just got two meals in Monread. Brought the fries back in because they were white and undercooked. Was told that they’re white because the oil is fresh, come back in a few days and they’ll be browner
1636 2018-07-04 21:26:31 Oil production has been increasing for years in the region but yield has remained steady. The oil is running out. You and your ilk can recommend tarnishing our great country's resources, but it will still run out. Why not support the fastest growing employer around? #cleanenergy
1637 2018-07-04 21:26:31 Not how I remember her. Out of her depth, arrogant, incompetent, awful economic decisions, failed experiment in monetarism resulted in almost 4m unemployed. Whilst she squandered our oil wealth on UB40

Daily Report: 
As the XL Pipeline continues to spill oil onto what was known as Nebraska, the 2nd Dust Bowl has rendered America's Bread Bowl a Dead Zone. Millions have fled West only to be encamped in refugee stations bordering the Rockies.
1639 2018-07-04 21:26:22 He needs to start a shooting war somewhere to save his presidency from impeachment. Why not Venezuela?  They have oil right?
1640 2018-07-04 21:26:20 That may depend on which Bible you're referring to. The Primary Christian Faith believes in the Old Testament and the removed portions such as the Yashua. The Holy oil..the physical gift from Jesus to heal the sick. The Koran is destructive, manipulative. I'll pray for you.

1644 2018-07-04 21:26:09 The country of 5 1/4 million is living off it's Nationalized North Sea oil fields. With out that oil, that US liberals would not want touched...their Socialist programs would have long ago bankrupted the country.
1645 2018-07-04 21:26:08 We have plenty of our own oil.
1646 2018-07-04 21:26:07 Ginger essential oil okay?
1647 2018-07-04 21:26:01 @realDonaldTrump On this day we celebrate our independence from the British Empire. When are we going to celebrate our independence from other countries. China using our trade money for their military. Mexico with their drugs and illegal immigrants. Saudi Arabia high oil prices.

1651 2018-07-04 21:25:46 Mr President, you’re responsible in some way for the jump in gas prices. Your Ill-advised arbitrarily action of forcing Iranian oil off the international market to suit your fragile ego. Everything you get in turns out badly. Let’s face it, you’re not a genius. Check yourself.
1652 2018-07-04 21:25:33 The  @AngusFrmrMarket happening tomorrow from 4-8 pm, outside the library. Expect fruits & veggies, bread, wine, cheese, olive oil, meat, honey, maple syrup and jam! We are so excited that the market is back and is happening every 2 weeks this year! BBQ, music and car show also.
1653 2018-07-04 21:25:11 Start the natural gas line pipeline in Alaska, and we have enough oil here to never depend on others. America first 
1654 2018-07-04 21:25:04 Don’t we have our own oil supply?
1655 2018-07-04 21:25:01 Uppy brings a much more physical game then Letestu, and he’s a much better penalty killer. Plus he already has chemistry with Brodziak. Don’t think he would hurt the Oil at all.
1656 2018-07-04 21:24:58 So you sell Armourments to your 9/11 attackers then kick Iran driving up oil prices then Saudi ups the oil price to pay for the Armourments then you make out like your the defender of America doing something to lower prices . Your a slight of hand Grifter

1661 2018-07-04 21:24:25 Why?
You making money off Saudi oil?
1662 2018-07-04 21:24:23 Asking oil companies to reduce their profits  I'm sure they'll get right on that. We need to break this country's addiction to fossil fuels and that'll be the end of price gouging
1663 2018-07-04 21:24:17 What are American oil companies doing to take care of America first?
1664 2018-07-04 21:24:15 And when gas goes down in the next month then it will be... “Trump hurting Middle East oil producers “  you all a bunch wet blankets grow up ... and ... and respect your president

1670 2018-07-04 21:23:58 How about instead of investing in foreign oil, we invest in energy solutions here at home
 #solarpower, #WindEnergy, #hydrogen all of these can be quite #profitable for early investors! And it still is early for all these solutions
1671 2018-07-04 21:23:58 None of them, that’s the point. My friend Eduardo made $300,000 betting oil futures one summer and Eduardo won’t come close to getting in. The ability to make money doesn’t impress anybody around here.
1672 2018-07-04 21:23:53 Just get rid of the Maduro Regime, and you'll get rewarded with plenty and cheap oil. FOLLOW YOUR INSTINCTS ON THE MILITARY INTERVENTION.

1677 2018-07-04 21:23:10 Your man Putin and the Koch brothers are just fine with rising oil/gas prices. I'm sure Putin will tell you that at your Helsinki summit, the one you don't want any Americans in the room to hear what you have to say to him.

1680 2018-07-04 21:22:48 Ya girl just got an oil
1681 2018-07-04 21:22:39 it's 00:21 am i really going to paint with oil on canvas huh
1682 2018-07-04 21:22:36 I actually use a salve that is sold at our local store. I have degenerative arthritis along with a myriad of others. My knees have felt better than they ever had. I am so happy KS legalized the oil. That topical version really works well for me in my joints
1683 2018-07-04 21:22:36 Howling into the void isn't going to magically reduce oil prices, Chief. JFC, it's like you have no idea how to president. Or how supply and demand works.*They* have the supply, and they get to *demand* whatever $$ they want bc we'll pay. Maybe we should've invested in green pwr.
1684 2018-07-04 21:22:31 Don’t look behind that curtain! Putin’s pulling your strings. He wants higher oil prices and you pretend otherwise. Meanwhile you send Congressional delegates to meet with him on the 4th of July? How messed up is that ?
1685 2018-07-04 21:22:28 Oil. It’s all about oil and the slimy Trump.
1686 2018-07-04 21:22:24 Great numbers coming soon to leave for Cincinnati, Oil production, while charging Amazon and taxes?
1687 2018-07-04 21:22:16 Lol you blame OPEC, funny how @POTUS44 kept oil prices low but now we have a @POTUS that is owned by Russia so we have $75 a barrel oil. We all know your play blame everyone else and hope the idiotic 32% that think your god won’t turn on you. SAD
1688 2018-07-04 21:22:12 So the hostile oil cartel gets a two way street, while our military and economic allies get America first
1689 2018-07-04 21:22:00 I’ll be waiting with vernier and rocol oil in hand
1690 2018-07-04 21:21:59 Water is more precious than oil - love the analogy #ResBazWelli
1691 2018-07-04 21:21:54 @realDonaldTrump OPEC influences but does not control oil prices.  Given their preferences, they would like to see a return to $100+ a barrel.  However they realize that should they get blamed for this price, there would be severe retribution.
1692 2018-07-04 21:21:48 The U.S. and world needs to stop being held hostage by OPEC. Open more areas to drilling and encourage U,S, , Canada , Mexico, Central and South America to create their own oil cartel to help keep oil secure and prices fair for all of the Americas. Build wealth for the Americas!
1693 2018-07-04 21:21:46 We need 10 new refineries built. Oil supply is adequate production is lacking in a growing economy. We supply ourselves out of a demand situation. Get err dun.
1694 2018-07-04 21:21:45 More #tweetiatrician tips for #FourthOfJuly 1) Apply sunscreen q2h (no, coconut oil is not a good substitute) 2) Supervise kids at all times, especially around water/fireworks 3) We’re not free until all kids are reunited with their families (and we have leaders who care again)!
1695 2018-07-04 21:21:43 Next Trump will raise tariffs on oil. 
1696 2018-07-04 21:21:42 My thoughts too although many are on Appropriations Committee. Shelby and Granger are chairs of the Appropriations Subcommittees on Defense in their respective chambers. Follow 45 statements on Crimea, US troops in Germany, sanctions. They’re prob trying to move on oil in Arctic.
1697 2018-07-04 21:21:25 Oh I know! don't understand how my mums friend could sit in the back garden covered in cooking oil honestly no lie lol...
1698 2018-07-04 21:21:20 What happen to your Saudi pals? You screwed with the oil supply when you pulled out of the deal with Iran. You have no control over OPEC. You can throw all the hissy fits you want, they are not an extension of the Dept. Of Energy.

1704 2018-07-04 21:20:59 Couldn’t be happier that Oilers are dodging this bullet (so to speak).  I’m very interested to see how elite he continues to be skating on half a foot.  Sure I might be wrong, but is a risk I wouldn’t be willing to take if i’m the Oilers at this stage.
1705 2018-07-04 21:20:52 So yes, just like coal used as door stops or paper weights, oil converted to clothing has negligible effect on climate change. Which is the point I was making in my very first reply.
1706 2018-07-04 21:20:49 But #DonTheCon your boss #badvlad needs high oil prices for the Russian economy? Don’t you remember your chat?
1707 2018-07-04 21:20:48 Why don't we just use American oil then? I thought we had the highest production level since 1970 last year? 10 million barrels a day.  I don't get it. I'm sure Trump doesn't either.
1708 2018-07-04 21:20:47 Let's just not buy their oil and only use our US oil
1709 2018-07-04 21:20:24 And anyway, it's all the dudes trading in oil futures that are probably driving up prices. Like the last time.
1710 2018-07-04 21:20:17 Wow, if only we had a major oil field we could increase production on to compensate...
1711 2018-07-04 21:20:08 Into the system win win for everyone. And gets cars off roads  cleaner transport  cleaner air, less pollution and saves in oil reserves and helps reduce pollution related illness as the air is cleaned. Modern green tech will see this through.
1712 2018-07-04 21:20:07 If Drumpf actually had concerns about US gasoline prices, he should be talking to US Oil companies, not OPEC.  They're still receiving Billion$ in tax breaks & subsidies, while making more profit than any other industry in history.
I personally feel gas is entirely too cheap!!!
1713 2018-07-04 21:20:06 @realDonaldTrump why can't we get our oil from Canada?
1714 2018-07-04 21:20:06 One does not negotiate oil prices by Tweet! What a loser!
1715 2018-07-04 21:20:05 Blocking Canadian oil exports is ineffective because oil-importing countries will buy their oil elsewhere. If I buy all my groceries from my local Safeway, and it shuts down, I won't starve. And it won't raise the price of oil, because OPEC has spare capacity. 2/2
1716 2018-07-04 21:20:03 That's your fault, a soon you have imposed sanction  to Iran, the oil price went up , and I am sure, the American can sell oil , only if those price stays high
1717 2018-07-04 21:20:03 So, since Mexico just elected a socialist, why would anyone want to leave?   Isn’t socialism supposed to be better? Didn't work for Venezuela so won't work for Mexico. despite both being oil rich countries.
1718 2018-07-04 21:19:58 My understanding we are paying the same for a barrel of oil today as we did In The 80's. 
And its wall street, manipulating the prices. Corporate Greed!
Why don't you attack Wall Street for ripping off America! And lining the pockets of the one percent.
1719 2018-07-04 21:19:43 daaaaammmnnn... can I get some oil for my popcorn?
1720 2018-07-04 21:19:41 Very little of US Oil imports come from OPEC. 40% comes from Canada then Mexico then Venezuela.
1721 2018-07-04 21:19:36 1. Wash your face daily with a mild cleanser and warm water. Wash your face whenever you feel its getting oily.
2. Do not apply make-up skin that is prone to get blackheads.
3. Avoid using bar soaps. Excess moisturizers can cause increase in oil your skin.
1722 2018-07-04 21:19:30 Oil. It’s all about oil.
1723 2018-07-04 21:19:29 What happened to foreign oil independence? Speaking of two way street - you put on a tariff - I put on a tariff. Everything is dollars with you isn't it
1724 2018-07-04 21:19:14 Then it would follow that you’d be concerned about the tankers going from Alaska to Washington. Because guess what it passes? 

But oddly, it’s just Canadian oil on tankers that’s of dire concern. Not the American oil going through the same waters.

1729 2018-07-04 21:18:56 As if Salman didnt ask him to scrap the Iran deal specifically to increase the cost of oil ahead of 4tg of July weekend
1730 2018-07-04 21:18:54 If Trump is worried about the $ price of oil maybe OPEC should start trading in another currency
1731 2018-07-04 21:18:51 Or, they could just buy US Oil at half the price of OPEC's. (But then Al Presidente wouldn't be able to explain the tax at the pump) @AndiMakinana
1732 2018-07-04 21:18:44 "Nobody
could possibly have predicted
that preventing Iran and Venezuela
-2 of the world's top 10 producers-
from selling their oil
would result in higher prices

I'm sure the Saudis
want to reduce prices to where
they artificially brought them before"

@potus @realDonaldTrump
1733 2018-07-04 21:18:43 Man flight tickets for Ibiza has skyrocketed, I wonder if tweeting Iberia or Ryanair will bring the prices down #OOTT #TrumpLogic #OPEC
1734 2018-07-04 21:18:27 Wasn't OPEC in charge oil when the prices was lower when you took over as President. Perhaps Obama knew more about the subject than you.
1735 2018-07-04 21:18:26 Knew much of this already. UK debt as %of GDP is > EU as a whole. So, arguably, UK more exposed to external factors.
Other commentators and economists not calling this out. Today HSBC cited US tightening, rising oil prices & trade wars as biggest threats, not Euro zone stability
1736 2018-07-04 21:18:21 I completely agree that we need to accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels. Thinking globally, we can use carbon pricing to cut our own emissions (which is what Trudeau is doing). But blocking oil exports is both ineffective and costly. 1/2
1737 2018-07-04 21:18:11 Exactly. And the fact even those oil lovin' dudes are offering them three-year money at yields in excess of 10% gives you an indication that the credit market views this as a risky proposition.
1738 2018-07-04 21:18:11 Nice try, Donnie. We all know that your cronies are pushing up oil prices because they can. It has nothing to do with OPEC.
1739 2018-07-04 21:18:11 @clarins_uk facial products are so amazing. Especially the lotus facial oil. Absolutely love it
1740 2018-07-04 21:18:11 Wait - I thought SA was going to produce millions of barrels of oil extra each day because they were doing trump a favor. Guess that was bullshit.
1741 2018-07-04 21:18:10 So much here is wrong - start w/ OPEC not being a Monopoly - but IF oil trade is to be a "two way street", then what would OPEC GET from cutting prices?

You have a child's grasp of economics, you need to #Resign
1742 2018-07-04 21:18:10 Is there a specific reason why we have two blends of oil?
1743 2018-07-04 21:18:08 Happy 4TH OF JULY IN MOSCOW to you and Repubs  @SenJohnThune @JerryMoran @SteveDaines @SenJohnHoeven @SenShelby & @SenJohnKennedy!  No Dems with U? Guessing you're working on  GOP/Russian cyber help for the midterms? Maybe lifting sanctions? Oil rights?  #Traitors #PutinLove
1744 2018-07-04 21:18:08 You can also look at the waterway between Houston TX and the Gulf which is used by about 80 oil tankers a day.
1745 2018-07-04 21:18:04 Listening to @KylieReiri on #DataScience for Research at #ResBaz at @VicUniWgtn @VicResearch When she talks of preparing for reuse & #datacleaning I'm reminded that data is the water of the system not the oil. Data is essential!
1746 2018-07-04 21:18:02 Some of our Canadian friends also boycott Trudeau for his policies concerning the environment.  He is a politician and supports not buying US goods when it suits him. Let him support stopping shipping the oil through the pipeline for instance.
1747 2018-07-04 21:18:02 He’s looking for oil!
1748 2018-07-04 21:17:57 What? I'm fairly certain we dont get very much oil from Iran
1749 2018-07-04 21:17:56 Wait! You said we only used domestic oil and gas. That production was way up with you! So are you exporting all of US production to Russia ?
1750 2018-07-04 21:17:54 I love this French president  please let us exchange... please France we will add 5 barrels of oil free too 
1751 2018-07-04 21:17:46 Careful, he will decide to invade Venezuela and take their oil.
1752 2018-07-04 21:17:46 40 % of your oil imports come from Canada then Mexico and Venezuela. Very little comes from OPEC. Where do you get your information?
1753 2018-07-04 21:17:43 Defends them from who? Israel is the leading terrorists around according to the UN. Keeping the oil flowing to China? Our southern border could use a lot of those troops, Germany has the Muslims to keep them safe.  The Europeans don't want to pay because they're not worried.
1754 2018-07-04 21:17:43 With Trump batting for the oil company, that will change!
1755 2018-07-04 21:17:40 A charlatan selling snake oil.   Who knew?
1756 2018-07-04 21:17:32 Yeah that should work - a tweet in all caps calling for OPEC to" reduce oil prices now."   But really are you sure you understand business because, uh, that's not how markets or pricing works.
1757 2018-07-04 21:17:31 Standing in the way of Tar Sands reclamation is the Oil Deep State.  Setting up the public to hold the $50B liability bag.
1758 2018-07-04 21:17:22 Only problem with the reissue was that the dampers leak oil. The original didn’t. There are lots of kits available on eBay to fix the problem. Better gaskets. Mine leaked for months and are now dry. One day I’ll get around to fixing it :).
1759 2018-07-04 21:17:21 Donald my friend, learn about jevons paradox and peak oil
You can’t have infinite growth on a finite planet
Don’t you care about your kids? In a world of scarce resources you can’t eat money
1760 2018-07-04 21:17:17 While I wait I miswell do a coconut oil hair mask
1761 2018-07-04 21:17:15 They suggest against essential surgeries, medicines, therapies and vaccinations, not to mention most of its treatments are snake oil that makes people poorer as it threatens their health.
1762 2018-07-04 21:17:12 Do the caps have an effect on you?  It won't on big oil.
1763 2018-07-04 21:17:11 Use less....be more efficient.  But then as a champion of oil and coal you won't grasp that.
1764 2018-07-04 21:17:09 Smh, idk why that guy thinks they need a comeback. If you live in the right places they never left. #Merica
1765 2018-07-04 21:17:04 Happy 4TH OF JULY IN MOSCOW to you and Repubs  @SenJohnThune @JerryMoran @SteveDaines @SenJohnHoeven @SenShelby  &  @RepKayGranger! No Dems with U?

1766 2018-07-04 21:17:02 Man oil paintings some whack shit
1767 2018-07-04 21:16:58 You can't have the global market for oil, including domestic oil, high....but also have gasoline prices all low.
1768 2018-07-04 21:16:56 Awesome idea: invest in renewable energy and cut the rope that binds us to oil in the first place! You’re supposed to be the greatest brain ever! Figure out a way to do that! Make a deal!
1769 2018-07-04 21:16:54 My POTUS what about the US producing more oil than they ever have what about that
1770 2018-07-04 21:16:54 when you become a mam do your hands automatically turn burn proof?? just seen my mam test how hot oil was by touching it fgs
1771 2018-07-04 21:16:53 Oil. Get it right.
1772 2018-07-04 21:16:51 That’s a lot of words to use to say “I have no idea how the oil market works!!!”  Besides, why do you care? Arent you contractually obligated to buy your gas from Lukoil? #TrumpRussianPuppet
1773 2018-07-04 21:16:33 We are manufacturing more oil than ever before... and the prices don’t come down.... somebody is lining their pockets
1774 2018-07-04 21:16:31 Probably wanted to steal their oil build golf course
1775 2018-07-04 21:16:24 Spanish is great too! My wife has family in Portugal and they give us a gallon of their farm-made olive oil everytime we go there. Man, it is incredible.
1776 2018-07-04 21:16:21 Oh I’ll bet the solution is all that Russian oil.
1777 2018-07-04 21:16:20 Because Norwegian bonds are (or largely started as) an oil thing? The buyer base loves the oil business.
1778 2018-07-04 21:16:15 He has been asking them to increase production to bring it down idiot.this what happens when the left band all oil exploration and drilling here in america. Leaves us at the mercy of the middle east
1779 2018-07-04 21:16:15 Happy 4TH OF JULY IN MOSCOW to you and Repubs @SenJohnThune @JerryMoran @SteveDaines @SenJohnHoeven @SenJohnKennedy  &  @RepKayGranger!  No Dems with U?

1780 2018-07-04 21:16:10 Would you like to see the future of clean green energy that is self contained and requires no outside influence such as solar panels or windmills coal or oil. People this is kinetic energy at it's best. Come be a part of the clean green energy dream team. #greenenergydream
1781 2018-07-04 21:16:05 How long until you ban foreign oil? Crippling the US
1782 2018-07-04 21:16:04 J'aime une vidéo @YouTube : "Marvel's Cloak & Dagger | Season 1, Episode 6 Sneak Peek: Roxxon Isn’t Drilling For Oil | Freeform" à
1783 2018-07-04 21:16:02 YOUR economic policies have dragged up the price of oil & gasoline. You are unfit to lead. #ResignNow
1784 2018-07-04 21:15:56 For 2016, the value of U.S. energy imports from Canada was $53 billion, while the value of U.S. energy exports to Canada was $14 billion. Crude oil makes up most U.S. energy imports from Canada, averaging 3.3 million barrels per day (b/d) in 2016
1785 2018-07-04 21:15:55 When I was a kid, I dreamed a few times that I'd won the props from the movie and even in the dream I wasn't sure what I'd do with them. I suppose I'd need to keep them out of the sun and occasionally oil them to stop the rubber from rotting.
1786 2018-07-04 21:15:50 And fish oil neh
1787 2018-07-04 21:15:47 Blend 2 tablespoons eggs with 2 cups Ahi Tuna. Add Olive Oil. Roast. Serve with love.
1788 2018-07-04 21:15:45 Hmm, I’m not sure there is a monopoly if there are many other sources for oil. But, I’m not a stable (and elite) genius, so I could be wrong.
1789 2018-07-04 21:15:44 Haha sorry dude didn’t know it was urgent. Mayo, black pepper, apple cider vin, and honey for a classic cole slaw. Dijon, white wine vin, lemon juice, black pepper, and olive oil for some classic vinaigrette action. Nothing too fancy.
1790 2018-07-04 21:15:40 Haha so there are rules on what questions can be asked and when? Our use of oil and coal as a fuel is the most basic principle of climate science. Coal can find a new market used as paper weights or door stops (solid state) without a problem. But we can't use it as fuel.
1791 2018-07-04 21:15:39 Interrupting July 4 to send another nonsensical tweet on the oil markets. Wow. Who invests longer term in oil production when you have this going on twice a week?... Wait for the superspike in the run-up to your re-election bid Donald! #OOTT
1792 2018-07-04 21:15:38 There's definitely critiques of Maduro that is to be had (his authoritarianism, his continued refusal to diversify his economy away from pure oil)  but his authoritarianism is at its worst not different to how police treated Standing Rock or other large protests (and small ones)
1793 2018-07-04 21:15:26 What's a more fitting way of celebrating the 4th of July than invading an oil rich country in the middle east? Remember when you joked/truth about invading Iraq again and taking their oil at the CIA at the beginning of your 1st/last term?
1794 2018-07-04 21:15:26 Man heals 208 year old dead postal worker back to life by rubbing hemp oil on his eyeballs.

1795 2018-07-04 21:15:24 At some point Putin will order the donald to change course.  Global recession won't be good for oil producers either.
Problem is, reversing the effects of a trade war is much more difficult than being foolish enough to start one.
1796 2018-07-04 21:15:23 Well in the ingredients list there’s nothing that I’ve eaten in different foods that’s given me a reaction. It’s just sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa mass, rice syrup, inulin, coconut oil, rice flour, emulsifier, then just general ‘flavourings’, which could contain hidden ingredients
1797 2018-07-04 21:15:22 "Give us cheap oil! I don't care about your income! Only I can claim to be treated unfairly!"
1798 2018-07-04 21:15:16 Also their oil rig is why Tyrone got his powers in the first place
1799 2018-07-04 21:15:16 Didn't Ross call him a Coal company shill?  Ross seems ok with oil.
1800 2018-07-04 21:15:15 Maybe I should write a fan fic about how exclusionary housing policy creates a huge migration to Idaho/Alaska as oceans rise and the heat becomes unbearable. Obvi, in reality it will mean we depend on oil and gas even more. Crank up that a/c babe.
1801 2018-07-04 21:15:11 People repelling from bridges to block oil tankers. An individual scaling #statueofliberty in defense of #AbolishICE. As people get more and more disgusted, the greater and greater the willingness to risk their lives for what they believe in. #protestispatriotism #4thofJuly2018
1802 2018-07-04 21:15:10 That isn’t a good argument for more oil, but it’s a great argument for alternative fuel sources.
1803 2018-07-04 21:15:10 I thought u were gonna invade South America, and steal all their oil? What happened with that plan?
1804 2018-07-04 21:15:05 Fund raising stunt be Greenpeace.   If they were really concerned they would protest in their home city of Amsterdam where there are 100s of oil tankers & barges everyday.
1805 2018-07-04 21:14:59 hey hehe go oil your acne
1806 2018-07-04 21:14:57 Bon, mon G5 est à peine moins représentatif que le #G400énergie ! ;-)
1807 2018-07-04 21:14:56 Again you are WRONG blame the Oil&Gas industry they are the one manipulating the prices and stealing the resources from the OPEC Members but you won’t do it since they have you in ther pocket & the military is Oil&Gas Industry Bodyguard
1808 2018-07-04 21:14:55 just bought sun chips instead of cheetos and put lavender oil in my diffuser so this holiday bout to be wild
1809 2018-07-04 21:14:51 I'm from Colombia. We have a decent central bank, low inflation, a lot of fixed income investment And it is also oil related.
1810 2018-07-04 21:14:49 Lie, he makes buck buck on gas and oil I’m sure.
1811 2018-07-04 21:14:37 How about the discovery of oil in Ontario under Ford's govt!
1812 2018-07-04 21:14:36 So just keep doing what we are doing to see who's right? Keep polluting, keep poisoning the air our water our seas the water we drink, keep putting plastic into our oceans and oil and fracking poisoning our land and animals..for what ?
1813 2018-07-04 21:14:36 I have anointing oil.... U can use
1814 2018-07-04 21:14:15 [Scene: one-on-one Putin-Trump meeting]
"Now, Don, we don't want low oil prices. That would be bad for everybody."
"But Mr. Putin, we can have low OPEC prices and Russia's can be high!"
*Vlad rolls eyes*
1815 2018-07-04 21:14:14 But..Just spoke to King Salman of Saudi Arabia and explained to him that, because of the turmoil & disfunction in Iran and Venezuela, I am asking that Saudi Arabia increase oil production, maybe up to 2,000,000 barrels, to make up the difference...Prices to high! He has agreed!
1816 2018-07-04 21:14:05 Twitter in Chief

That's not how you govern and not how oil pricing works
1817 2018-07-04 21:14:01 Because Iran could sell oil nitwit. Now we get a nuclear Iran and higher oil prices.
1818 2018-07-04 21:13:59 Knock knock

Who’s there

Not America

Not America wh-wait what

Not America because freedom doesn’t knock, freedom rings. Also, not really gonna knock, can we have some of your oil.
1819 2018-07-04 21:13:57 Just mix a lemon juice with olive oil and ginger and drink it. Worked like magic for me
1820 2018-07-04 21:13:57 Russia has a surplus of oil due to sanctions. They will sell it to OPEC. OPEC will say the increased production. And an anonymous LLC (belonging to Trump) will have money deposited into it.
1821 2018-07-04 21:13:54 OPEC controls Oil Output. Our refineries output controls gas prices.   You never cease to amaze me with how little you actually know about how our country works and the rest of the world
1822 2018-07-04 21:13:51 Keep yelling at everyone. I’m sure OPEC leaders will just do what you say. Why don’t you put a tariff on the oil? Didn’t you say trade wars are easy to win?
1823 2018-07-04 21:13:49 Happy 4TH OF JULY IN MOSCOW to you and Repubs  @SenJohnThune @JerryMoran @SteveDaines @SenShelby @SenJohnKennedy  &  @RepKayGranger!  No Dems with U?

1824 2018-07-04 21:13:44 I used olive oil here as well. Spanish though
1825 2018-07-04 21:13:43 A bad workman blames his tools. Personally think you’re getting a bit muddled up. I have heard of it infact an American man created it. So you probably think he’s a racist oil merchant and hates native Americans as you like the one size fits all approach.
1826 2018-07-04 21:13:37 Okayyyy! I’m continue to use that & get me some oil.. Thank you boo!
1827 2018-07-04 21:13:30 giving aid and economic capital to OPEC's largest supplier of oil, Saudi Arabia and we later kicked Iran in 79 for obvious reasons. We did this in order to weaken (and compete) the Soviet Union, as they were a major exporter of oil.This is where we got the idea to create Al Qaeda
1828 2018-07-04 21:13:27 A lot of US oil producers stopped exploration/exploitation of domestic fields when prices went down. You'd think @POTUS would be happy they'll be able to resume work. JOBS!
1829 2018-07-04 21:13:23 Which country you going to invade first? You are spoilt for choice mate. The world is chock full of brown people with oil everywhere! Maybe Iran since you have beef already from the Nuke deal Or perhaps Venezuela since they are close and just a slightly different shade of brown?
1830 2018-07-04 21:13:06 IN the UK"British ppl see "false flags" for what they are,
To preempt for war,steal Oil,Kill people,
Wiltshire police issues major alert,But did not know what this substance was,
Hang on,was this similar thing"backed by lying MSM.
Skripals
1831 2018-07-04 21:13:04 You're the one driving up oil prices with an Iran policy that is premised on reducing the supply of Iranian oil available in international markets. Heard of the law of supply and demand?
1832 2018-07-04 21:13:01 If trump subsidizes it, manufacturers  distributors can but into the Texas Basin and operating at a loss in Texas, ramp up production and distribution for net positive income. USA GDP net grows while OPEC gets slaughtered. Expect oil prices to plummet or be ready to buy shares.
1833 2018-07-04 21:12:59 Use North America oil
1834 2018-07-04 21:12:58 You said that Saudi Arabia pump more oil after you ask the king, that was a lie the king not agree.
1835 2018-07-04 21:12:57 Aw American Oil not good enough anymore? 

Or are you just angry people are blaming you for removing all benefits of the tax cut with your tarriffs and attacks? Poor baby - you gotta rough it remember? That is what you said and all.
1836 2018-07-04 21:12:44 Oil prices are at a 4 year high because Trump nixed the Iran deal. #LiarInChief
1837 2018-07-04 21:12:40 If oil is made from decomposed dinosaurs, and plastic is made from oil - plastic dinosaurs are made from real dinosaurs.
1838 2018-07-04 21:12:39 I love that stuff  i be using lotta body coconut line and olive oil !
1839 2018-07-04 21:12:37 American oil too

1841 2018-07-04 21:12:33 I thought your Magic Pipeline was going to do that? Oh wait, that's Canada's oil. And you were a total dick to them. The Art of the Deal in full effect. Stable genius over here.
1842 2018-07-04 21:12:27 Donny is angry apparently #oott
1843 2018-07-04 21:12:26 IMO - OPEC IS GOING DOWN - WE DONT NEED THEM - We have one of the biggest discovery of oil here in the US - energy independence
1844 2018-07-04 21:12:25 Oil. It’s all about oil.
1845 2018-07-04 21:12:24 Lily’s dad is really out here buying me break pads, break disks, an oil filter and oil,,,,and helping Chang it all,,,,,I’m in love
1846 2018-07-04 21:12:20 Right? I watched “It” and I want to know whether Pennywise is actually changing his physical form or just messing with the kids’ minds. Either way, let’s figure that shit out and harness it to reduce our dependence on oil!
1847 2018-07-04 21:12:05 There's no greater cooking smell than onions cooking on whatever. We often use portuguese olive oil over butter here, it's incredible
1848 2018-07-04 21:12:00 Coconut oil helps my g-daughter when she has gluten breakout!!! Fyi!!! 
1849 2018-07-04 21:11:55 Drill baby drill fu-- them and there oil. Tariffs or no tariffs we got your back. Free tread for all or you have to pay too. There choice. Why do we have to pay and they don't. Come on America not fair to us. Wakeup sheep stop with the Tabloid news.

1852 2018-07-04 21:11:48 *pulls out of the Iran deal
*wonders why oil prices have increased
Can't make this stuff up
1853 2018-07-04 21:11:46 now that trump opened his big mouth about gas prices, expect them to skyrocket.  he must have stock in the big oil companies because he is working for his own interests again.  we're all screwed as long as he remains president.
1854 2018-07-04 21:11:39 Welcome to the world of reality. We in Canada have long been aware that the price of gasoline at the pump has little relation to the price of oil in the barrel. #historycompares
1855 2018-07-04 21:11:38 Donnie you caused high gas prices by killing the Iran deal and imposing sanctions on their oil production. Own it Donnie. Then RESIGN!
1856 2018-07-04 21:11:34 My 10 year old cousin who has had terrible seizures & epilepsy since she was 3 months old has been on nonstop meds & all these medical tests for 9 years & she finally got  approved for cannabis oil & I’m so fucking happy I could cry 
1857 2018-07-04 21:11:28 Currently USA is producing more oil than Venezuela so stop spreading crap
1858 2018-07-04 21:11:26 IT IS YOUR FAULT OIL PRICES ARE UP. DONALD TRUMP'S FAULT
1859 2018-07-04 21:11:22 TARIFFS on OIL exports to the USA is what Canada needs to do!  How about 50%!
1860 2018-07-04 21:11:20 Love you but I have a lot of 401k  in oil stocks.  Wish u could knock off the oil producing talk
1861 2018-07-04 21:11:18 You do realize that part of the cause for the price of oil is also due to oil being a speculative market, right?
1862 2018-07-04 21:11:05 They control the oil. You have to work with them. You can't run them. You are not the boss
1863 2018-07-04 21:10:58 Also americans have loads of shale oil and president does not give a fuck about the environment, so what are you worried about? Drain the oil swamp!
1864 2018-07-04 21:10:54 The US has a monopoly on oil prices and supply. The US broke up OPEC in the 70s after the Arabs cut off the gas lines and oil supply to the United States because of their support for the Israelis in Yom Kippur war in 1973, leading to the stagflation. The US broke up OPEC by
1865 2018-07-04 21:10:53 Aloe Vera pulp! Coconut Oil!
1866 2018-07-04 21:10:52 When one gets old....hydrocortisone, Kirkland brand & soft toilet paper become your hang. All you oldies know what I’m talkin’ about. Oh! And woodlock oil as well. That comes in handy!
1867 2018-07-04 21:10:46 Why don't you look to big oil companies that control the oil/gas supply from well to pump? How close to full refinery production are we at? More oil is only tip of oil/gas iceberg. Your simpleton tweet shows how little you understand the issue. #NeverTrump #IdiotTrump @StopBigOil
1868 2018-07-04 21:10:44 What % of oil extracted goes into making fuel sources that create CO2? Be a long time before we stop pumping out oul. Gas will continue to be extracted past 2025 and hopefully coal will fall considerably.
1869 2018-07-04 21:10:44 If they created Castor Oil and Witch Hazel flavored snack, as long as it came from Disney people would love it no matter how nasty the taste.
1870 2018-07-04 21:10:37 Your understanding of the oil economy is flawed.
1871 2018-07-04 21:10:35 Mixed messages. US oil and Russian oil, would prefer lower output, but just a few days ago, you Donald made a special deal with Saudi. Don’t play games and “play” both sides... tell us what you really want for the American people.  You work for us.
1872 2018-07-04 21:10:35 Do you understand that oil is a global commodity?  Because it doesn’t look like you do?  The time to tell them to pump more was before the meeting.
1873 2018-07-04 21:10:31 tbs tea tree oil gue make sampe abis ga ngaruh apa2 bingung bat gua

1874 2018-07-04 21:10:30 alarming - مخيف، مقلق

The local authorities publicly announced that a few species of fish are dying in the sea at an alarming rate. Relating that to the closeness of the oil refinery location is not certain yet.
1875 2018-07-04 21:10:26 シエル君撫でたら睨まれちったよ(；｀ω´)
1876 2018-07-04 21:10:22 Nor did the original oil dump deliberately orchestrated by the USA and Saudi Arabia. 

Nor will, I assume, the new one being conducted by the Trump admin and the Saudi monarchy. 

Weird how Saudi can openly massacre Yemen and orchestrate genocide, yet have no sanctions.
1877 2018-07-04 21:10:22 This is not how Boko Haram started, their region is not even oil producing....oil is produced in the Niger Delta in Nigeria comprising of 9 oil producing states none of which Boko Haram originated.
1878 2018-07-04 21:10:21 Who are ‘them’ the international oil giants?  They build them where they have the best tax and economic environment.  Could be here If the various gobs could get their acts together.  Northwest redwater upgrader is the first new refinery in many years.  Thx GOA!!
1879 2018-07-04 21:10:13 I thought Saudi Arabia was going to increase oil production
1880 2018-07-04 21:10:06 ああ、これ？スポーツブラ。油の貯蔵庫が垂れちゃうからね。
1881 2018-07-04 21:10:05 June 30th you tweeted that King Salman of Saudi Arabia had agreed to help lower oil prices. Today you say, "they are doing little to help." What's gone wrong?
1882 2018-07-04 21:09:55 I wonder if he'd freak out if they started flooding the market with oil, even though that's what they'd have to do to "REDUCE PRICING NOW"
1883 2018-07-04 21:09:54 Go Electric
Tesla vehicles affordable
Dump Oil
1884 2018-07-04 21:09:53 certain plants you can specifically extract chemicals to make the oil and they are only marine remotely
1885 2018-07-04 21:09:50 Happy 4TH OF JULY IN MOSCOW to you and Repubs @JerryMoran @SteveDaines @SenJohnHoeven @SenShelby @SenJohnKennedy &  @RepKayGranger!  No Dems with U? Guessing you're working on GOP/Russian  cyber help for the midterms? Maybe lifting sanctions? Oil rights?  #Traitors #PutinLove
1886 2018-07-04 21:09:43 That's lesbian activity
1887 2018-07-04 21:09:41 There is no hypocrisy in using the tools that are available to affect improvements. Those plastics will be available for use long after oil reserves drops below economic usefulness. Yours is not an argument. You’re being disingenuous and reducing this argument to a binary.
1888 2018-07-04 21:09:36 Or add more incentives for electric and solar. Reduce our dependence on oil completely.
1889 2018-07-04 21:09:22 Very short sighted from all players specially  with the recent pressure on OPEC and the new oil cartel .... worrying!
1890 2018-07-04 21:09:17 You should definitely slap some tariffs on that. After all, why would you not go all America First on foreign oil? Go ahead, great negotiator. ;-)
1891 2018-07-04 21:09:14 The embargo on Cuba is like starving a person who is of no threat to you whilst doing business with the local kingpins who keep sending assassins after you (Like Saudi Arabia does with their support of Jihadists).

The fall in the oil price didn't help Venezuela either.
1892 2018-07-04 21:09:14 Agree, James.

I love these guys who MAKE MONEY only on the Resist Idea.  What the Hell has Max ever done to build this great nation and keep it strong.

Too many Leftwing fools are listening to Snake Oil Salesmen.
1893 2018-07-04 21:09:14 You could always invade Venezuela and steal their oil!
1894 2018-07-04 21:09:11 News flash. Most of your imported oil comes from Canada who you want to screw over at every turn. The US will really be complaining once the pipeline to the BC Coast is built and Alberta oil can be easily shipped to International markets for more money
1895 2018-07-04 21:09:01 Damn oil companies and their global warming are ruining your tomatoes.
1896 2018-07-04 21:08:51 Exporting American oil is the problem.
1897 2018-07-04 21:08:49 Reminder: The turmoil on the oil market is a consequence of Trump deliberately destroying the Iran deal despite all warnings from friends and partners. Happy idiocy day!
1898 2018-07-04 21:08:49 Sir what abt oil prices.Saudi arabia is taking u for a ride. U r the boss,show thm and command thm to reduce oil prices
1899 2018-07-04 21:08:47 Predictive text. You must have heard of it. Well you probably did invade there in the past when it was called Persia. You like taking other countries oil. Just like the good old U S of A.
1900 2018-07-04 21:08:44 Well what about the Strategic Oil Reserve?
1901 2018-07-04 21:08:38 OPEC is not a monopoly. It has 15 member countries. There are 42 country’s that produce more than 100k barrels per day. There are 18 that produce more than 1M. 

The US produces more oil in a day than Saudi Arabia (the highest producing member of OPEC). 

This is a lie.
1902 2018-07-04 21:08:38 By people he means cartels. This is a big clue he’s in deep with them.
1903 2018-07-04 21:08:22 you can extract certain oceanic substances to make oil
1904 2018-07-04 21:08:19 Tbh hot but also tbh put some coconut oil on it because antibacterial & 40 degrees
1905 2018-07-04 21:08:18 Oh, I love it! I grew up with NY style. There's a romance to it. The chewy crust, the way the cheese sits on the mozzarella, olive oil dripping from the fold... But I love both.
1906 2018-07-04 21:08:16 hot oil splattered on my arm while I was cooking and since our sink is kind of broken and only has hot water I couldn't cool it off in time. owwie ;_;
1907 2018-07-04 21:08:07 Fuck off (thanks tiff)

But i tend to stick to heavy oils like black castor oil. Many of these dont take nigga hair into consideration
1908 2018-07-04 21:08:04 @waglenikhil @DrVishwam @AnjaliDamania activists like you should protest against nannar oil refinery and jaitapur, the people of konkan need eco tourism ,agro processing jobs, and not the ones which degrade environment and abuse the flora and fauna there, konkan has no reprensntn
1909 2018-07-04 21:07:56 I told my mum about what happened today, and she said "don't worry I know why your brake failed"  

Now she's down, bathing the car with olive oil and praying. 
1910 2018-07-04 21:07:56 How about we stop dealing with the middle east entirely? We have enough oil here to meet our needs for the next 200+ years, not including reserves. Let's pull out of that deal too and let them fight it out without our money.
1911 2018-07-04 21:07:55 .... hehe... what did you think will happen when prevent the competition from selling oil.... bright spark....
1912 2018-07-04 21:07:54 So let me get this straight opec has something you need and you expect them to give u oil at the price you want just because. So if I walk in to a shoe store and I think prices are too high I can just tell  Nike make more shoes so the price will come down that’s not how it works
1913 2018-07-04 21:07:52 Oh I'm so sorry he isn't funding the people that want to kill us and say death to America!!!! We have more oil than anyone here on our own land
1914 2018-07-04 21:07:52 But oil and water don't mix, right
1915 2018-07-04 21:07:51 Wait so you want foreign companies to send us their oil at lower rates, undercutting American oil producers?
1916 2018-07-04 21:07:47 Lordy. He thinks hectoring them on Twitter will make them change their minds?! He doesn't remember the 1970s Oil Crisis, where people across the country waited HOURS in line at gas stations? Jeez, he is such a schmoe.
1917 2018-07-04 21:07:44 Another low-IQ take on a complicated topic from our demander-in-chief. I'm sure hearing, "we give you stuff therefore you must give us cheap oil" certainly put them in their place. Or trade policy has degraded to "GIMME! GIMME!"
1918 2018-07-04 21:07:41 Trump's causing chaos and discord among the US and its allies, and is calling on OPEC to cut oil prices.

None of the OPEC countries have any reason to do so. That's not how supply and demand works.
1919 2018-07-04 21:07:17 So true. You know the oil markets well. Thanks for trying to keep prices down. A massive SPR release will help.
1920 2018-07-04 21:07:11 The 70s called and asked for their crisis back. 

Have Barron explain to you that the U.S. now produces more oil than we import and only 1/3 of our imports come from OPEC countries.
1921 2018-07-04 21:07:10 Russia and OPEC have acted in large part to skyrocketing production  within the U.S., which, thanks to the advent of hydraulic fracturing, is  experiencing a shale oil boom.
1922 2018-07-04 21:07:09 I have put on so much tanning oil today. Clearly never learned my lesson from Aruba
1923 2018-07-04 21:07:03 I watched Putin's Q&A.  Russians are raising holy hell over gas prices. Russian  government stated they were going to reduce their tax on gasoline. Sauds need money.  Amazing how we own AMACO before Sauds bought it.  Remember the AMACO signs? Boehner, own oil. Dump OPEC
1924 2018-07-04 21:06:41 Your car will tell you when its time.  It will give you a message saying need to change oil soon.
1925 2018-07-04 21:06:40 No, 200 miles is economic also.... includes fishing and oil etc
1926 2018-07-04 21:06:39 y r we sending @CanadianArmy 2 fight #US/#israhell wars that dont concern us?
u have troops illegally against intl law @UN charter in #Syria WTF we doing there protecting ISIS??
The US fight 4 oil,resources belonging 2 other nations people,thats exactly y they fail domestically
1927 2018-07-04 21:06:39 Easiest way to lower gas prices is to keep American barrels of oil in the USA. Not to send them to China. #stopoilexports #energyindependence
1928 2018-07-04 21:06:36 "Freddie Blay deposited $3million for the 275 buses for each constituency"

Me: He is the board chairman of GNPC 
Our oil money is with GNPC.
1929 2018-07-04 21:06:31 You guys still not taking the breakup well?
1930 2018-07-04 21:06:23 Another 'negotiation' gone bad. Saudi Arabia was suppose to pump more oil in exchange for 'nixing' the Iran deal. Obviously...they have decided what @realDonaldTrump says or means doesn't count. Sort of like Kim Jung-Un upping his nuclear development.
1931 2018-07-04 21:06:19 1. OPEC is not a monopoly.
2. Crude prices were too low for a long time, hurting US oil  businesses
3. OPEC knows that you are the #IllegitimatePresident, and they will only be cordial when they must. They are simply waiting until your failed authoritarian regime is over.
1932 2018-07-04 21:06:19 That's not how any of this works.

They're out to profit from world events and chaos that you're spreading with your idiotic trade war.

The ones benefiting most from your crazy trade policies? Russia.

They aren't hit with tariffs and benefit from high oil prices.
1933 2018-07-04 21:06:16 Just made some bomb ass spicy bbq ribs, green beans in olive oil and minced garlic & some garlic & herbs pasta
1934 2018-07-04 21:06:07 @RajThackeray your votebank is from konkan primarily, if you want konkan to progress, create jobs like agro processing, which are suited to the land, stop nanar oil refinery and jaitapur which will degrade the beauty of konkan and eventually the lives of people
1935 2018-07-04 21:06:06 1) Trump threatened Iran. Claims he will stop all exports of Iran oil.
Threat drew the attention and support for Iran president.
1936 2018-07-04 21:06:01 you are lying as you have been misleading the world by telling them something and acting exactly the opposite. you just fucked up the Iran deal and putting sanction on Venezuela then asking for cheap Gas and Oil!! Russia, Saudi and your elite friends are the only winners
1937 2018-07-04 21:06:01 Boy, I'm seeing Russia all over this! The spike in gasoline costs are also a direct result of the Organization  of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producers —  namely Russia — reaching an agreement two years ago to limit oil output.
1938 2018-07-04 21:05:53 I see your call to Prince Salami of Saudi Arabia TELLING him to reduce oil prices had a big effect.  Ask Putin...he's got a lot of oil. Oh, wait...you owe him too much already. Never mind.
1939 2018-07-04 21:05:53 I just dropped coconut oil everywhere god really wants me dead huh
1940 2018-07-04 21:05:45 The oil companies will disagree with you sir. Ask the Koch Brothers.
1941 2018-07-04 21:05:44 No, that will hurt the oil producing states in America.
1942 2018-07-04 21:05:38 or we could stop trying to milk the rest of the world for all of their crude oil and start looking towards alternatives
1943 2018-07-04 21:05:38 The curse of oil strikes again
1944 2018-07-04 21:05:31 weak minded people influenced by foreign oil companies trying to stop Canada so they can corner the market. You are bought and paid for ignorant hypocrites and unless you are vegan you are not an environmentalist...period!
1945 2018-07-04 21:05:27 Hard to tell if the red diagonal is a die cut line or a prohibition demarkation.
1946 2018-07-04 21:05:27 The price of oil is mostly set by the futures market, and markets are VERY complicated. DJT is too simple-minded to understand that and zero interest in learning.
1947 2018-07-04 21:05:19 that they have the best genes?
1948 2018-07-04 21:05:18 Cut them if half, toss in olive oil, pre heat oven to 400, cook with seasoning of choice. Flip when they start to brown. When second side browns turn on the broiler for a minute or so. Serve with parm cheese. Be happy
1949 2018-07-04 21:05:17 The new tv commercials coming out of Alberta say we need the #Transmountain pipeline so that #Canada can be self sufficient in oil. Uh, no. We’re sending the bitumen to the US to be refined. #StopKM #ClimateChange #ActOnClimate #cdnpoli
1950 2018-07-04 21:05:16 Pulling out of the Iran deal didn't help anything.. They cut oil production for spite!  Why didn't you just fix it with a better deal?
 What did we get out of the keystone pipeline deal? All it did was make the Koch bros the wealthiest in America.. So  more funding for the GOP..
1951 2018-07-04 21:05:14 When you choose a major like marine biology or art history major, and you can’t figure out why you can’t find a job? Weird. Men make more! Not many women in construction, coal mines, oil rigs, engineering, if you want equality then you can do the jobs that men do.
1952 2018-07-04 21:05:13 Actually we were get 75% of the oil production in iran trump drop it to 25%
1953 2018-07-04 21:05:10 Lol 'dirty' oil. Are you that brainwashed? Pipelines and tankers are the safest way to transport the product. Or would you have all tanker and oil shipments stopped? I hate Trudope but he never promised to stop shipments of oil...kinda seems like your the liar

1956 2018-07-04 21:05:00 Wash your hands with a small drop of vegetable oil.
1957 2018-07-04 21:04:58 Can some one tell the President that we are the largest oil producer in the world in the last 5 years, but we are also a high-cost producer, and a low oil price hurts us MUCH more than OPEC?
1958 2018-07-04 21:04:58 Gas prices are up because of your BAD economic and foreign policies!

If you want lower gas prices then remove the massive taxes charged per gallon and ask American oil companies to lower their prices. Those oil companies have had record profits every quarter for the last decade.
1959 2018-07-04 21:04:55 Any minute now he'll announce exciting news, by lifting sanctions on Russia new sources of oil are available. This will bring down prices. Its always been getting the sanctions lifted.
1960 2018-07-04 21:04:54 It seems like the whole of Nigeria has actually being sitting on top of oil... It everywhere now. Taraba, Borno, Yobe, Gombe, Bauchi....
1961 2018-07-04 21:04:42 Are they also slamming oil and gas companies for price gouging? No? Interesting #bcpoli #induceddemand
1962 2018-07-04 21:04:42 TELL THEM MR. PRESIDENT! BUNCH OF GREEDY PEOPLE IN THE OIL INDUSTRY. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
1963 2018-07-04 21:04:38 If oil is made from decomposed dinosaurs, and plastic is made from oil - plastic dinosaurs are made from real dinosaurs.
1964 2018-07-04 21:04:37 My dumb ass wanna wait until it’s a “holiday” to get a damn oil change when everybody closed
1965 2018-07-04 21:04:34 
1966 2018-07-04 21:04:29 Fun fact Donald OPEC represents ~40% of global oil production. #readabook
1967 2018-07-04 21:04:24 You want Venezuela’s oil.
1968 2018-07-04 21:04:22 If oil is made from decomposed dinosaurs, and plastic is made from oil - plastic dinosaurs are made from real dinosaurs.
1969 2018-07-04 21:04:19 OPEC isn't a monopoly, it's a cartel, produces 46% of the worldwide crude oil and condensate refinery feed. @realDonaldTrump @RitchieJodi
1970 2018-07-04 21:04:19 Making matters more difficult, the Trump administration has imposed a  deadline on oil buyers to cut off purchases from Iran by Nov. 4, just  two days before most Americans vote.
1971 2018-07-04 21:04:18 The dude is going to be protected by the cartels as the first full fledged Narco Presidente
1972 2018-07-04 21:04:03 Um, they have done something. They have increased oil production. You left the Iran deal. High gas prices are on you #PresidentFucknut.

1973 2018-07-04 21:03:58 @medhanarmada stop nannar oil refinery madam, people of konkan are treated like orphans due to no pol representation, they need environment friendly jobs like agro processing, nron, jaitapur and nannar is going to ruining the environment of konkan, please stop it ,
1974 2018-07-04 21:03:53 OPEC is barely producing a third of the oil worldwide.
USA is the largest oil producer in the world, we produce more than Saudi Arabia!
High oil prices are direct result of your trade policies
Facts matter.
1975 2018-07-04 21:03:51 World Bank      Iran sits on $45 Trillion in Oil Reserves.
1976 2018-07-04 21:03:46 Dismantle foreign countries? Is that what you're suggesting? Do you know what OPEC is? I'm guessing not. All antagonizing the group of countries that form OPEC all going to do is drive the prices of oil through the roof. And make it more dangerous for our soldiers in the region.
1977 2018-07-04 21:03:46 WRONG. Oil prices are high because Donald Trump unilaterally decided to leave the Iran deal.
1978 2018-07-04 21:03:39 And check for air pressure and fill the anti freeze and change the oil and replace the battery. Now how's your Etuofee game?
1979 2018-07-04 21:03:36 actually oil is made from the ocean not dinosaurs surprisingly
1980 2018-07-04 21:03:31 Just to make it clear, Saudi oil that goes through Red Sea is exported from Yanboa’ and Jedda and Muaajez, Saudi oil that’s being exported from Ras Tannoura in the Persian Gulf goes to Eastern Asian countries though Hormoz, so NO Saudi oil passes through Bab Al Mandib strait
1981 2018-07-04 21:03:22 U r making running gava a very expensive exercise when we could avoid importing bad sugar at the expense of local sugar. Right now we r exporting iron ore while we import the same commodity again. We r importing oil while at the same time we r stocking locally mined oil to export
1982 2018-07-04 21:03:21 Shut the hell up before you cause them to raise prices higher or worse stop oil sent to America.  Your an idiot Donald
1983 2018-07-04 21:03:09 And here’s the best part..... any aggressive move by the US to limit OPEC’s influence would cause a supply disruption and immediate and long-term spike in oil pricing. So good luck with your “dismantling” threats.
1984 2018-07-04 21:03:07 Or, here's another idea, you could work on making America energy independent so we could care less what OPEC charges for their crude oil. Renewable energy is the future... get out of the way or get run over by the train of progress.
1985 2018-07-04 21:03:02 I'm sure your gaslighting and finger pointing will bring fuel prices down Dotard. After all, it worked so well last time you tweeted about oil prices. Why don't you just go golfing? We'll be fine without you.
1986 2018-07-04 21:03:00 "If #Iran is prevented from selling its oil, no oil will cross the Persian Gulf", a clear warning from the #IRGC commander Admiral Kawthari to the world, and particularly to #USA and #SaudiArabia.
1987 2018-07-04 21:03:00 We must be held captive to others nations.  Efforts to build new refineries and produce more oil that can be used for transportation is necessary. Also continue to be finnd ways export of natural gas.
1988 2018-07-04 21:02:58 Why should it go up every year. It only harms those who can least afford it. The amount oil prices have gone up the increased vat take covers it. Hardly fair to hammer people just to fund the hobby of a minority
1989 2018-07-04 21:02:58 Just spoke to King Salman of Saudi Arabia and explained to him that, because of the turmoil & disfunction in Iran and Venezuela, I am asking that Saudi Arabia increase oil production, maybe up to 2,000,000 barrels, to make up the difference...Prices to high! He has agreed!
1990 2018-07-04 21:02:54 Aggiungerei che l’economia era trainata da OIL e GAS.
Magari @CottarelliCPI può mostrare a #Borghi il trend del GAS in quegli anni.

Sul Palio di Siena lo lasciamo parlare, ma qui trattasi di economia reale.
1991 2018-07-04 21:02:54 Please stop tweeting about #OPEC #WTI #OIL every tweet of yours drive the price higher. #WTI has gone from $60 to $75 since your tweets.
1992 2018-07-04 21:02:47 MAGA...use American made ethanol instead of foreign oil...support your country use E15 everywhere
1993 2018-07-04 21:02:43 With nothing but sand to look at, no water,and a male dominated culture that is 500 years behind the times. They got wealthy from our desire for oil. Let's turn our backs on them and Produce Our Own Gas From Our Own Wells. Thirty days in America and Saudi women wouldn't leave.
1994 2018-07-04 21:02:39 They have a typo in their webpage bullet point: "
• Improve efficiency: Oil submerge mining, reusing the excess heart" <--
should read: "...reusing the excess heat."
...and that is a GREAT FEATURE too!
1995 2018-07-04 21:02:37 Dude, it’s their oil. They’re just implementing their version of MAGA....Make Arabia Great Again.

1997 2018-07-04 21:02:33 Oil prices had been around 2 dollars for 8 years till you showed up. Your supporters saved 5 dollars a month on taxes but will end up paying 30 a month on gas
1998 2018-07-04 21:02:20 @prrobbins  thoughts? I think oil is bout 2 tank
1999 2018-07-04 21:02:20 If this was the 50s then I would agree with you because they actually fought for rights but now it’s for oil so that they “fought for your rights” narrative isn’t true. It’s the US constitution that gives us our rights not people fighting overseas
2000 2018-07-04 21:02:16   might I suggest some Udos oil.. does wonders :)
2001 2018-07-04 21:02:15 Trump can’t dismantle OPEC, OPEC stands for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. It’s made 12 major oil producing countries in Asia, Africa and South America. Trump has nothing to do with this. You and Trump no nothing.
2002 2018-07-04 21:02:13 With the oil. That part was clear.
2003 2018-07-04 21:02:13 Um, actually I think oil prices are on the rise because some dummy slapped sanctions on Iran.
2004 2018-07-04 21:02:05 You know what would reduce oil prices?  Higher fuel economy requirements on cars. Investment in alternative fuels.  You know what won't?  You moaning and complaining like an overgrown toddler.... SMH #MoronInChief
2005 2018-07-04 21:02:02 Contrary to this  absurd article, the coup to overthrow Maduro has been going on for  years. All the opposition forces are in place, Colombia and US Oil Corporates are nipping at the bit. How dare the AP  allow such one sided schmultz to cover for the  heist of  Venezuelan oil.
2006 2018-07-04 21:02:01 I thought we were going to oil independent?
2007 2018-07-04 21:02:00 Creates instability in the region. Oh, and Iran is in OPEC. Do you know how oil trade works ? At all ?
2008 2018-07-04 21:01:53 @Dev_Fadnavis nanar oil refinery if implemented in konkan make sure we will never vote for you, don't ruin the lives of konkani people, you have already done through nanar, NRON, and now jaitapur, instead create agro and food processing industries
2009 2018-07-04 21:01:51 We aren’t in OPEC. They don’t want us in. But you’re an economic simpleton if you ever believe they will listen to you on production quotas. Why would they cooperate w/ You or the U.S. when we’re putting more oil on the World market than ever before, and you Ok US oil exports.
2010 2018-07-04 21:01:42 Did you know that the US pays Canada approx $30 LESS per barrel for oil than world price. Great deal for the US.
2011 2018-07-04 21:01:37 Castor oil ni, ya the one taking about protecting ur rapist friends na 
2012 2018-07-04 21:01:34 CBD oil, which is legal over the counter in PA, helps too. Just no THC in it.
2013 2018-07-04 21:01:32 Stop it u clown, high oil prices help ur buddy Putin remember he had u pull out of the Iran deal?
2014 2018-07-04 21:01:31 Oh, just one more thing: Oil prices are high because Donald Trump unilaterally decided to leave the Iran deal.
2015 2018-07-04 21:01:30 Time to Unleash The Power Of Fracking!!Finish the pipelines as Our Oil Flows the price will drop!
2016 2018-07-04 21:01:26 Isn’t the price of oil still ridiculously low?  When it’s high the Canadian dollar reaches par with the US dollar. I haven’t heard of that happening yet.

2019 2018-07-04 21:01:18 Well Smartie pants,
Quashing Iran deal, cuts the flow of oil & THAT PUT HIGH GAS prices 
On the BACKS of the POOR AND MIDDLE CLASS! 
Also CUTS the SALES of New cars! Drives inflation!
Then the pesky Tarriffs =
Recession!
Thinking a real President would CARE ABOUT  people purses!
2020 2018-07-04 21:01:18 Weren’t you telling us recently that we no  longer rely on foreign oil?
2021 2018-07-04 21:01:17 They all want the Russian oil.
2022 2018-07-04 21:01:15 That advice is a laugh, leading to olive oil everywhere.

I say: Buy avos hard, rest room temp til just barely soft, keep in fridge up to 3 days for use. Can cut in half around the pit, chill unused in plastic wrap.
2023 2018-07-04 21:01:13 We see you. You did this blowing up the Iran deal. Now you want oil from Russia and you’re setting the stage. Traitor to your office. Like your new Kim haircut.

2025 2018-07-04 21:01:11 Let’s push US production of oil.
2026 2018-07-04 21:01:09 Invade them and take their oil and money!!
2027 2018-07-04 21:01:08 They look like the graduating class of Crooked Pete's School for Televangelists and Snake Oil Sales.
2028 2018-07-04 21:01:06 "Such a move would cut deeply into the market share for natural gas producers, many of which are also among the nation’s largest oil companies"

2030 2018-07-04 21:01:02 Pres wait and see when your trade war tariffs are hit and the prices go above the roof. Dont blame others for that. US has its own oil and yet it is not distributed within USA at lower price. Sir you are accountable for your policies that make on sense but help you point fingures
2031 2018-07-04 21:01:00 If oil is made from decomposed dinosaurs, and plastic is made from oil - plastic dinosaurs are made from real dinosaurs.
2032 2018-07-04 21:00:56 In one ear and out the other the USA is ignorant.  They need to quit whining like two year olds.  They are as transparent as toilet tissue.  This isn't about job creation it is about eliminating cars in the lower to middle income class 20 to 50 years from now. #Oil
2033 2018-07-04 21:00:54 But you said the other day that you spoke to King Salman of Saudi Arabia and he agreed to increase oil production, maybe up to 2,000,000 barrels due to the turmoil & disfunction in Iran and Venezuela.....What Happened?!?!?!  Guess that didn't work out very we/l, huh?!?!?!
2034 2018-07-04 21:00:54 Erm! What has Russia got a lot of?............. Oil! I smell a 'deal'
2035 2018-07-04 21:00:53 Hey... Remember Canada? You know.. The security threat?? We've got oil.. .. Just sayin..
2036 2018-07-04 21:00:40 That policy now threatens to leave the world with a shortage of crude  oil and rob Americans of the gasoline price relief they usually get in  the autumn.
2037 2018-07-04 21:00:33 Strengthening:

2041 2018-07-04 21:00:28 But, but, but, you said the KSA already agreed to increase oil production by 2 million barrels a day? Were you lying? Some KSA official indicated you were lying. 

@POTUS lies like a cheap Trump Tower flea-infested rug in a room where they held illegal meetings with the Russians.
2042 2018-07-04 21:00:25 (When I said yesterday that I would interrupt my Twitter time-off for holiday if Trump tweeted again on #oil / #OPEC I was really hoping for more than a 26 hours break) #OOTT
2043 2018-07-04 21:00:25 this is just a smokescreen to blame someone else rather than accept it's his own policies leading to the rise

iirc the US was meant to be about 90% self-sufficient in oil based on last years figures, and that was expected to increase this year
2044 2018-07-04 21:00:25 I thought you talked to some Saudi Prince and he said he'd lower oil prices for you. Another lie!
2045 2018-07-04 21:00:23 What about using our own oil?
2046 2018-07-04 21:00:22 July 04, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
2047 2018-07-04 21:00:20 
2048 2018-07-04 21:00:18 Greed— they want the Russian oil.
2049 2018-07-04 21:00:18 What is it about getting an oil change that makes it "feel" like your vehicle is suddenly more awesome?
2050 2018-07-04 21:00:15 Oil prices are just right for us in the oil business lets not screw it up people rely on oil for a living
2051 2018-07-04 21:00:14 Yummmmmmm!!!!
We did some butter and olive oil and roasted it the other day. SUPER yummy.
2052 2018-07-04 21:00:14 How much oil do we actually get from the middle east? Aren't we the biggest exporter of oil in the world? We have enough to self sustain. Getting oil from the middle east is a thing of the past.
2053 2018-07-04 21:00:12 why reducing oil price?
Better to consume less oil and invest in alternative solutions.
Look to Europe and for sure China.
USA has lost his chances with this #potus
2054 2018-07-04 21:00:11 "Trump has sought to follow through on campaign promises to help the coal industry, but those efforts are angering oil and natural gas producers"
2055 2018-07-04 21:00:11 Apply jojoba oil for 20 minutes before going to the shower. This promotes fast hair growth!
2056 2018-07-04 21:00:10 Soooo, this is all your fault? The Trump administration's effort to punish Iran by swiftly curtailing  its energy exports is undermining its goal of preventing oil prices from  rising ahead of mid-term elections.
2057 2018-07-04 21:00:03 Or we could invest in renewable energy sources but you just keep sucking that oil, fam.
2058 2018-07-04 20:59:54 I thought we are fracking all over the country for oil stop buying it from them and use our own reserves until they beg us to buy from them
2059 2018-07-04 20:59:52 C'mon Donny, your friends and voters want high oil prices.
Otherwise #fracking and #Shaling  doesn't pay off.
2060 2018-07-04 20:59:51 @realDonaldTrump 
Less than half of our oil comes from OPEC nations.
Most OPEC nations are not being served by the U.S.
OPEC nations charge less for oil than U.S., Canada & Mexico.

Reading is Fundamental.

2063 2018-07-04 20:59:29 Remember your Oilfield Mid American soldiers President Trump - a lot of jobs a lot of dreams - 50$ oil no jobs no dream!!
2064 2018-07-04 20:59:28 And then it would collapse whole industries reliant on oil and its by-products.  God forbid these companies evolve.  Keeping people tethered to outmoded technology so they can continue to make money is the end-game.
2065 2018-07-04 20:59:22 Why would they help? As a businessman I’m sure all your businesses were non-profits right? Oil is a commodity. Why kill CAFE standards influencing demand and then point the finger elsewhere
2066 2018-07-04 20:59:12 Of COURSE they’re driving prices up - oil is their primary export, so why would they not want higher prices? Add to that your admin’s non-support for alternative energy - and thirst for oil - and it will continue.
2067 2018-07-04 20:59:12 Remember when he said “Take the oil?” Venezuela is a prime source of the world’s oil supply.
2068 2018-07-04 20:59:12 Hello, you caused the fuel increase by breaking our agreement with Iran which takes their oil out of the market, thus raising the price of gasoline?  As always, now you want to blame others for your errors, how sad are you Mr. Trump!
2069 2018-07-04 20:59:08 I need to do a hot oil treatment

2071 2018-07-04 20:58:53 The whole point of an oil cartel is to drive prices up. I'm starting to understand how you managed to go bankrupt running a casino.

2073 2018-07-04 20:58:52 defence is based all over the world not just wales and then by that token wales must also rely on scot for oil as well deeming you again not self reliant
2074 2018-07-04 20:58:51 ...esp since oil rigs recruit their talent from any & everywhere. Not only would this affect FL env[.], but there's no guarantee FL would benefit economically. Matter of fact, all the workers on the rig MIGHT BE RUSSIANS!

Can we nuke them, John?  Can we take their oil, Mike?

What to do?  Let's type in ALL CAPS!  That will do it.
2077 2018-07-04 20:58:24 Thoroughly enjoying this @Phillies game. Can’t believe they’re only two games back in the National League East. Usually they’re leaking oil by now.
2078 2018-07-04 20:58:21 You don't actually know that cap and trade has nothing to do with home heating bills.   Your plan for reducing gas prices is to sit down with the oil companies and ask them nicely.  I guess when you elect a man without a plan, you get a man without a plan.
2079 2018-07-04 20:58:21 I know of it but from d inception of democracy in 99, we ve never seen infrastructures beign done like now against all d fall in oil prices which is nigeria's main source of revenue. Roads, railways,  etc.
2080 2018-07-04 20:58:18 Yes sure. Dismantle oil fields. That works.
2081 2018-07-04 20:58:16 Hey love, blend 100g plain flour with 100g Vegetable shortening (like Trex or Shorteen). Then add 100ml veg oil and blend til it’s like cream. Brush it on your tins instead of using baking paper. Keep the extra in the fridge for future use. It’s magic!

2086 2018-07-04 20:58:02 I have both of those! I think I have to get a different brand of witch hazel without all the extra ingredients that are in mine, and get things with vitamin e oil but not exclusively use it so concentrated. Thank you amber <3
2087 2018-07-04 20:58:01 Isn’t Russia currently selling its oil to free market? Is it sanctioned?
2088 2018-07-04 20:58:00 How about we do things to support domestic oil production and boost our own supply. #maga #americanoil
2089 2018-07-04 20:57:54 Although I usually do not agree with you, on this you are correct. .  They should lower our oil prices or we should stop defending them. One hand washes the other
2090 2018-07-04 20:57:54 I thought you were going to provide oil independence for the US, so it shouldn't matter what OPEC does, right?

2094 2018-07-04 20:57:42 Make oil not our number 1 export, and help reduce prices by stabilizing our own market. Importing oil is hurting us, just as much as exporting it is. We could handle this on our own, but we aren't, and haven't.
2095 2018-07-04 20:57:38 dude, oil prices are high because you reneged on the Iran deal.  Less supply = higher prices.
2096 2018-07-04 20:57:36 Oga what about gravity
2097 2018-07-04 20:57:35 I am so disappointed, Don! Didnt you just call up the Saudi king the other day and didnt you tell us he's going to help you out by pumping more oil to push down prices? Hmmm. Who you gonna trust?

2099 2018-07-04 20:57:28 Careful. Putin won’t like lower oil prices. He’ll be unhappy. Don’t make him unhappy. He won’t want to be your BFF anymore.
2100 2018-07-04 20:57:26 I agree the stigma around Middle East oil causing higher prices. However, we are exporting oil and again, as is years earlier, oil producers and refineries are making a killing, when there is no shortage of oil. #oilprice
2101 2018-07-04 20:57:23 So, EU, UK and US apparently are having a campaign against palm oil. Let's see what they got to bullshit about it
2102 2018-07-04 20:57:19 #MAGA let us Produce our own oil!!’
2103 2018-07-04 20:57:18 Clueless.
2104 2018-07-04 20:57:18 Idiot. US producers will drill baby drill in response to oil higher prices, increasing domestic production and supply, resulting in competition and decreasing prices until equilibrium is re-established. It’s Econ 101 - supply and demand. #Dotard
2105 2018-07-04 20:57:14 With prices rising our shale oil industry will get stronger. Guess they don’t need our planes and armaments.
2106 2018-07-04 20:56:58 It's still too cheap. Just consume less.

Lots of your products use too much energy? Like, let's say, your cars? Well, you're screwed.

Design, build and use better products, consume less energy and nobody has to complain about prices.

Just don't start another war on oil.
2107 2018-07-04 20:56:49 Same man I used to be straight oil but now im spf4
2108 2018-07-04 20:56:47 The recent drop in oil prices was initially credited to the possibility of tapping the US SPR

In our view the move, though likely to provide a drop in WTI pricing, would in actuality be more symbolic than systemic

Adding inventory doesn't equal adding availability

#CrudeOil
2109 2018-07-04 20:56:46 If America is so “oil rich” why are we depending on OPEC?
2110 2018-07-04 20:56:41 Global oil prices rose on Wednesday, driven higher by a decline in US crude inventories and rising Iranian supply risks. Brent crude rose by US48 cents or 0.6% to US$78.24 a barrel and the US Nymex rose by US19 cents or 0.3% to US$74.33 a barrel. #ausbiz #ausecon
2111 2018-07-04 20:56:38 Uh....wow he’s stupid. I’d like to pour hot oil over his orange head while I pore over his tweets.
2112 2018-07-04 20:56:38 How’s  the domestic oil industry feel about the prices?
2113 2018-07-04 20:56:32 Why are we pumping so much oil and not using it to offset prices here
2114 2018-07-04 20:56:28 I’ll have to go back & check b/c I tried so many kinds. I did have someone suggest very high dose CBD oil so I do still have that to try 
2115 2018-07-04 20:56:28 Maybe you can talk to Putin about the oil prices while you're visiting him.
2116 2018-07-04 20:56:25 Don’t you remember stating that your good friend, Saudi, King Salman, promised to increase oil production by 2 mil bpd? Did he lie or did you?
2117 2018-07-04 20:56:15 Drill for oil here in Alaska and gulf coast as well as West and East coast.... by producing more lowers costs in a  big way... plus liberals get their wet dream of independence of oil dependency of Canada and middle east
2118 2018-07-04 20:56:04 Yeah, that's where the rest of the definition comes in, concerning intensity & consistency. I am so with my adversion to heights, you with blood, oil with water and homo/transphobes with LGBTQ+ people.
2119 2018-07-04 20:56:02 It's "oil" not "oyel"

2121 2018-07-04 20:55:57 Honest? OPEC isn’t a monopoly as many countries produce oil that aren’t in opec.

Trumps literally first 3 words of this tweet are a lie
2122 2018-07-04 20:55:57 I’m still trying to figure out what Russia has to offer besides oil, vodka and hot prostitues.  Oh, I get it now...  stupid me!
2123 2018-07-04 20:55:55 “The Saudis and the RUSSIANS are both quite interested in seeing a  higher price of oil,” said Gary Hufbauer, at Peterson Institute for International Economics. “They agreed to cut  back on their production, and other countries are just unable to ramp  up enough to fill the gap.
2124 2018-07-04 20:55:40 Respectfully Mr.President. Higher oil prices help our producers and oil service companies which in turn helps our manufacturing. Also helps us become more energy independent. I thought that is what we want?  Prices go up. Prices go down. Best to leave it alone.
2125 2018-07-04 20:55:37 USA stop shipping oil to other countries keep the oil here.
2126 2018-07-04 20:55:36 OPEC founded and formed to drive the price of oil and gas up. My God read something someday.
2127 2018-07-04 20:55:33 Until the value of life overtakes the value of oil, people will continue to suffer and die. #greedybastards
2128 2018-07-04 20:55:30 "Oil and gas companies say a Trump administration proposal to bail out the coal industry will cut into their market share, while steel tariffs make their production equipment costlier"
2129 2018-07-04 20:55:25 But what about my oil and gas stocks, think of us shareholders trying to make our easy money.

2131 2018-07-04 20:55:19 Under your command the US has vacated every worldwide organization.  You can’t vacate OPEC as you are not a member.  Therefore you can’t do anything about the high price of oil.  In this case even your tantrums won’t help.
2132 2018-07-04 20:55:16 We don't buy oil from Iran. So false.
2133 2018-07-04 20:55:15 Love when I buy a Bali body tanning oil yesterday and today they’re 10% off ugh
2134 2018-07-04 20:55:11 Sitting here at our 4th of July party talking to Devin's grandmother about avocado oil... Y'all pray for me lololol
2135 2018-07-04 20:55:09 why must they bow to trump? your country has lots of oil. extract it and let the market decide the price for your domestic producers, I have no doubt the prices will be super cheap.
2136 2018-07-04 20:55:05 Invade Venezuela...and take the oil!
2137 2018-07-04 20:55:04 You might want to look into how limiting Iran’s oil is causing an impact on global prices.  The economic policies of Trump are having a detrimental impact on the economy at a rapid rate.
2138 2018-07-04 20:55:04 Of course,’Venezuela has a lot of oil. Isn’t he the one that said “we should have taken their oil” speaking about Syria or Iran?
2139 2018-07-04 20:54:52 The United States. The United States, the world's biggest oil consuming country, consumed 18.5 million barrels of oil per day (mbd) in 2012, which accounted for nearly 20% of the world's total oil consumption per day. ...
2140 2018-07-04 20:54:52 Ask your idol Putin to start pumping out more oil.
2141 2018-07-04 20:54:52 In order to drive down costs ... We need to produce and refine more oil in the United States

Lift the (Obama era) restrictions... Of course the environmental nut jobs will cry and complain...
2142 2018-07-04 20:54:50 Only 33% of our oil comes from open another 30% comes from Mexico and Canada and you've already pissed them both off, now you claim to be really close to the Saudis so what are you doing.
2143 2018-07-04 20:54:49 “Opec, you helped fund my election, why aren’t you protecting me from high oil prices!?!?” Is my take on it.
2144 2018-07-04 20:54:47 Start using those secret 0. energy and Tesla inventions to make fossil fuels become obsolete, than you'll see a change in approach and attitude. Or start producing coal conversion to oil technologies. Or manufacture our own oil energy for complete independence. Many ways to win !
2145 2018-07-04 20:54:46 Oil.
The only reason you want to invade Venezuela is to steal their oil. You don't give a s..t about Latino human lives.
"They should have taken the oil!"  You said that repeatedly!
Venezuela is not Crimea or Ukraine, and this is the USA, not Russia, at least not yet!
2146 2018-07-04 20:54:45 Global market, Kimberly.  We get it from the global market. That would be the same global market which gets oil from Iran that Trump's new sanctions impact.
2147 2018-07-04 20:54:42 Victor Umeh was talking about us coming to reality "when oil finishes" as many people say.

2149 2018-07-04 20:54:37 Have you tried applying oil to your hair? I used to have dry hair even if I used conditioner  but I started applying olive oil or coconut oil and leave it overnight. Then I rinse it off with shampoo and conditioner in the morning
2150 2018-07-04 20:54:32 Trump can’t dismantle Saudi Arabia and its oil producing partners! They only trade in US dollars! So if he keeps up they may decide to use another currency, then where will we be?!

2152 2018-07-04 20:54:26 If America only bought from American oil sources think how fast oil prices would drop
2153 2018-07-04 20:54:26 Iran and Saudi Arabia are having conflicts with each other which will destabilize oil production.
2154 2018-07-04 20:54:19 Oil is priced in USD. Stop debasing USD and the price of oil in dollar terms will stop rising. You shouldn't need this explaining to you.
2155 2018-07-04 20:54:16 2054 war AirCrafts’ Chinese were drown,2800 Chinese forces are in custody,3825 large atomic bombs were also neutralized during attacking Oil refinery of Kurdistan in Pioneer Islands of Arctic Ocean between Kara Sea laptev Sea on last days June 2018.This attacks was also defeated.
2156 2018-07-04 20:54:13 Donny Donny Donny OPEC was so last 70’s they don’t control prices we produce more. It’s the oil companies no one else look up the price of oil per barrel dumbass. No wonder you went bankrupt so many times you have no clue a 5 yr old knows more about the economy
2157 2018-07-04 20:54:13 "reduce pricing now!" he says..  
OPEC will think it over and oil can go to 80 and beyond in july
2158 2018-07-04 20:54:09 At the same time.. Oil prices being up.. Hurts the consumer.. But allows for the US energy markets to be profitable in the shale fields. Those jobs disappear quickly if the price per barrel drop down to 30 bucks/brrl Its a thin line..
2159 2018-07-04 20:54:07 So what‘ca gonna do, big guy? Bomb OPEC? Rape more government land for oil? Maybe all your buds that got all the “tax cut” will chip in and help out.
@DC_Resister_Bee @maddow
2160 2018-07-04 20:54:05 Oil is going up because biofuel mandates are restricting bunker fuel usage and it’s causing companies to spend a lot more money on refining.
2161 2018-07-04 20:54:05 Get rid of the stupid seasonal summer blend I have to buy in California. I’m paying extra to help big oil spew their toxic waste into the atmosphere. Thus they pass off their waste disposal costs to the consumer.
2162 2018-07-04 20:54:00 Probably for the oil.
2163 2018-07-04 20:53:56 Conditioning:
- 1 tbs olive oil
- 1 tbs honey
- 1 tbs epsom salt (for volume)

Mix everything. Then add it to your hair for 30 min, after that rinse with shampoo and conditioner!

2165 2018-07-04 20:53:54 Value of US Dollar dowm almost 2% last 12 months. Oil denominated in dollars. When value of dollar goes down, price of gas hors up. Other factors involved as well.

2167 2018-07-04 20:53:49 If we started getting into renewable energy we wouldn't have to worry about the price of oil just a farce
2168 2018-07-04 20:53:45 A couple weeks ago when you said this, oil went up 13%. Don’t think #OPEC cares
2169 2018-07-04 20:53:43 You never get it!  You said yourself if you fought the Iranians you would have taken all the oil!  You then start a trade war.  You keep starting fights and blaming everyone else.  THIS IS ON YOUR HEAD!!
2170 2018-07-04 20:53:36 Thank you Mr President. And please remind our Saudi friends that if the US didn’t find and dig up their oil they would still be nomads wandering the desert on camels. #maga
2171 2018-07-04 20:53:36 OPEC countries produce 40% of the world’s oil (hardly a monopoly).
2172 2018-07-04 20:53:34 It's very likely  that your rediculous policies are driving up prices. Speak nicely to Putin and he'll maybe give you some oil or why not invade Venezuela and steal their oil. 
You could say it was done to stabilise South America.
2173 2018-07-04 20:53:33 They haven’t given them the #BB water mugs so they cleaned out vegetable oil containers and are using them for water.

2175 2018-07-04 20:53:32 Russia will sell its oil to OPEC they will say they increased production and sell that sanctioned oil for more then they purchased it for. Where is your cut going? Some mysterious LLC? How many hundreds of those do you still own?

2182 2018-07-04 20:53:11 Someone forgot to tell him that if oil price goes down Russia will lose money.
2183 2018-07-04 20:53:08 For this year’s July 4 holiday, U.S. drivers will be paying the highest Independence Day average gas prices since 2014—at $2.90/gal, compared to $3.66/gal for July 4 in 2014, when oil prices were $100 a barrel, according to GasBuddy.

2185 2018-07-04 20:53:04 Are you sure you graduated from Wharton? OPEC is not a monopoly. It's a cartel. Tillerson was right. You are a "fucking moron." OPEC does not control the cost of gasoline. OPEC does not refined crude oil into gas. The laws of supply and demand control prices. Basic economics.
2186 2018-07-04 20:52:56 Let's expand our oil pipeline and refining capacity to keep pace with our expanded production capacity. Keep our oil in the US, and export the rest. Dominate the oil industry and bring OPEC to its knees, remember 1973? We owe them one! MAGA!
2187 2018-07-04 20:52:55 Ask global oil co like exon BP or halli urton, refinaries r t one that committing price fixing, if y call opec monopolizing oil prices, yoir future stick prices of crude oil is also manipulated by demand and supply, obama waa not wrong to go green, interstingly enough, Saudis ..
2188 2018-07-04 20:52:54 For fracking to be profitable, oil prices must remain above $50.00 per barrel.American oil comes through fracking.Many jobs depend on it.We also need relief from Obamacare regulations.Thank you, President Trump, for helping Americans!With timber also!John1:5

2195 2018-07-04 20:52:31 We are trying to bring sense into their brain! Majority of those who wants to vote PMB 2019 they either lack sense or they don’t want Nigeria to be developed! As patriotic Nigeria why would you vote for someone that only favour one side of the country?  Yorubas.
2196 2018-07-04 20:52:30 Thought you called them and they said “sure thing .. we will increase productivity” .. more lies. See if Putin will give you some oil.
2197 2018-07-04 20:52:27 We R not a country of mercenaries, we help because it is in our best interest and is the right thing to do. You control the national oil reserves, U can add more oil to the market, read a book, other POTUS have done so.
2198 2018-07-04 20:52:25 Or increase our own production and cut them off; release the oil workers to drill...
2199 2018-07-04 20:52:19 Why are you tweeting this?  So your robot supporters will think you are trying to do something about gas prices?  All this shows is that you do not control oil prices, just as Obama, whom you criticized, did not control oil prices!  Nor does the US, in general!
2200 2018-07-04 20:52:19 If we allegedly have so much oil of our own, why are we allowing #OPEC to dictate our #Oil & #Gas prices in the United States? #4thofJuly #IndependanceDay2018 
2201 2018-07-04 20:52:19 You know what would allow prices to be lowered? Allowing Iran to export some of their oil!
2202 2018-07-04 20:52:17 Taking Iran's oil out of the equation will contribute to the increase of oil prices! That's your policy BTW.. Isn't it strange how many times your policies actually achieve the opposite of your goals?!
2203 2018-07-04 20:52:02 Thank you sir! You made oil price great again. From middle east with love!

2206 2018-07-04 20:51:57 now wait for oil to rally lol
2207 2018-07-04 20:51:54 Keep oil production at same strength with consideration of aiming higher..
2208 2018-07-04 20:51:46 Guess who is responsible for oil prices going up, you moron!! Quit blaming everyone else for your assholery!
2209 2018-07-04 20:51:34 Just spoke to King Salman of Saudi Arabia and explained to him that, because of the turmoil & disfunction in Iran and Venezuela, I am asking that Saudi Arabia increase oil production, maybe up to 2,000,000 barrels, to make up the difference...Prices to high! He has agreed! Lie?
2210 2018-07-04 20:51:31 So he doesn't realize they don't give a crap about our gas prices?  They know Americans keep driving at $2, $3, and $4. They will push them up as far as the market allows before demand for oil drops.
2211 2018-07-04 20:51:31 You said that Saudi Arabia  agreed to pump more oil.  Was that a lie?   @PressSec @KellyannePolls    Or more alternative facts.
2212 2018-07-04 20:51:30 Lol Don OPECs prices are around half what they were 5 years ago. If you want to force prices down, use your own fucking oil.
2213 2018-07-04 20:51:29 @POTUS thought you were going to look after the middle Americans ...

2216 2018-07-04 20:51:06 Bahahaa!! You don't know shit about oil prices and affects of costs on downstream refining. 

Your silly little tweets wont make those opec boys change their ways on production #'s.
2217 2018-07-04 20:51:01 First it was take the oil. Now begging for lower prices. SAD
2218 2018-07-04 20:51:00 That's not how companies set prices, moron. Why don't you just put a tariff on oil? I'm sue that'll work out great! #Resign #25thAmendment
2219 2018-07-04 20:50:57 I thought Saudi Arabia had agreed to increase oil production ... did they lie? Are they slo-walking? I’d cancel the next order of military jets!

2224 2018-07-04 20:50:49 Lmao you do not produce as much oil as OPEC.
2225 2018-07-04 20:50:45 Crazy idea, maybe we should look into alternative & renewable energies so we don't have to worry about foregn oil.
2226 2018-07-04 20:50:45 More refineries now. Pump more of our oil
2227 2018-07-04 20:50:43 Just spoke to King Salman of Saudi Arabia &explained to him that, because of the turmoil & disfunction in Iran and Venezuela, I am asking that Saudi Arabia increase oil production, maybe up to 2000000 barrels, to make up the difference. Prices to high! He has agreed! 

You forgot
2228 2018-07-04 20:50:42 Sure great idea.  You must have never lived through the oil embargo of the 70s.  I did.  We, Americans, would be unable to take it.
2229 2018-07-04 20:50:36 It is Venezuela's oil and not the democracy that is of America's interest.
2230 2018-07-04 20:50:32 Or you could just invade Venezuela and steal their oil. That is the Trump way.
2231 2018-07-04 20:50:30 I wonder how to boost oil production in 6 months? @PDVSA promised to Opec to leverage it's share by the of 2018 !

Lie, fake or dream ?

"Someone is serving to convey a false impression"
2232 2018-07-04 20:50:29 Sound like you need to read up. I remember Chavez did great things for that country and he was giving away oil to poor countries. Nothing bad happened to their economy until we crashed the price of oil and then Chavez died and the new guy apparently sucks but it's our fault
2233 2018-07-04 20:50:27 This is one thing I actually agree with you about. The problem is that it is an international cartel and the odds of getting large oil producers to cooperate are just about nil. Don't start a gas war, you egomaniac. We're  #SEA (screwed enough already) with you.
2234 2018-07-04 20:50:24 Cooking oil ke fish oil
2235 2018-07-04 20:50:22 I know you don't read these but I would hope you would know that higher oil prices allow high-cost LNG suppliers in the USA to compete globally. If you want to help those poor defenseless fracking operations in red states this actually beneficial.
2236 2018-07-04 20:50:20 1. Trump somehow thinks OPEC owes him something.
2. Trump forgets that gas prices always go up during the summer.
3. Invading Venezuela to steal their oil would be a very bad idea (therefore we know he will do it).

Liar, racist, corrupt, unstable and incompetent.
2239 2018-07-04 20:50:13 Meanwhile the situation in Nicaragua continues to decline. There is no comprehensive policy or discussion about playing a positive role in the hemisphere, and the only option mentioned is whether or not to invade Venezuela. #oil #thenWhat
2240 2018-07-04 20:50:03 Why is it that since the end of the Vietnam debacle, republicans support wars only in countries with oil reserves???!
Their claim to be defending that country’s citizens “human rights” is BS.
If this was the issue, then Zimbabwe, DCR, Somalia, Syria would have been ‘supported’ .
2241 2018-07-04 20:50:00 Christ, he's attacking the oil barons now. This is the beginning of the end. Once we're paying $10 a gallon do you think the MAGAts will have a change of heart?
2242 2018-07-04 20:50:00 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
2243 2018-07-04 20:49:59 Moisturizing:
- 1 tablespoon of olive oil
- 1/4 cup yogurt
Mix the olive oil with the yogurt, then apply it to your hair and leave it for 15-30 min, then wash and rinse!

2247 2018-07-04 20:49:50 It's just a matter of time until we open up our oil production valves ... And drive the cost down....

But of course the environmental nut jobs will cry and complain..... 

Can't have it both ways.... We need to produce more oil in the United States and drive the cost down

2249 2018-07-04 20:49:42 We need some new refineries built in this country. We have an abundance of oil, but not enough refining capabilities to produce our various blends of gas. If we get a couple of new refineries up and running, gas prices will drop significantly.
2250 2018-07-04 20:49:36 Your pals, Russia and Saudi Arabia have been driving up oil prices. Why don't you ask your friend Putin to help out? The increace is fuel costs will more than offset what most families received in tax cuts. Thanks for nothing.
2251 2018-07-04 20:49:30 The law of supply and demand. The demand of oil and gas is high, so the prices will be high. This shows the importance of alternative fuels. It will decrease the demand of fossil fuels.
2252 2018-07-04 20:49:29 What are you going to do to make the largest oil cartel do what you say? Nothing. They'll raise prices because they can. Prices went up because of the Iranian Deal that YOU were part of removing. You were told prices would go up with that move. Prices are up. Shocking why, huh?
2253 2018-07-04 20:49:29 1/4 cup of vinegar (white) 3/4 cup water, 20 to 30 drops if lemon oil essential oil, shake it up, cleans grease and splatters well, all natural.
2254 2018-07-04 20:49:29 Dude. Don’t you realize that US oil production is barely profitable unless oil is above $50 a barrel, right?

OPEC increasing output _hurts_ our energy industry. That’s why they did it last time, to try and squeeze us out of the market.
2255 2018-07-04 20:49:21 Mr. President, the fault us not only with OPEC. The oil companies have ARTIFICIALLY raised pricing. Oil is $65.00 per barrel and gas is $3.29. Two years ago gas was $1.79 at $65.00 per barrel. Check your gas receipts people!
2256 2018-07-04 20:49:14 What to use in Lieu of Pesticides? Neem Oil, Garlic & Clove Oil, Azatrol, StrawFlower Extract... the list goes on!
2257 2018-07-04 20:49:11 Ask Russia for more oil.

2260 2018-07-04 20:49:02 Reduce oil prices.  Just say no to monopolies
2261 2018-07-04 20:48:55 Hey job producer you have to keep oil at 80 a bbl or the USA loses a lot of high paying jobs that pull folks out of poverty who have families and little skills to do other low paying jobs...but those are your voters so god speed
2262 2018-07-04 20:48:54 How about you call out the politicians who are in the oil companies pockets. Oh wait some of those people are your friends.
2263 2018-07-04 20:48:52 They aren’t allowed in but now rumpleforeskins wants to go invade Venezuela and I know he’s after their oil while pretending it’s to democratize them, when we live in an oligarchy and not a democracy ourselves..
2264 2018-07-04 20:48:47 Use our own oil. Quit selling it on the open market !!!
2265 2018-07-04 20:48:47 Why not start pumping our own oil.
2266 2018-07-04 20:48:46 What, are you going to put a tariff on gas next?  Gonna stop buying OPEC oil? Gonna send a nasty, misspelled tweet?
2267 2018-07-04 20:48:44 Sick of FOLKS telling Saudis, to Produce more Oil. This' what Obama did, shut-down Am. Oil Fields, & Refineries costing millions of High Paying, Oil Field Jobs. Pipelines weren't built-WE lost a FORTUNE. Produce our own OiL/Gas, WHAT HAPPENED

2271 2018-07-04 20:48:27 More oil is not the issue, idiot. It is the declining value of the US dollar, in part, to many other issues. Supply of oil is NOT one of them
2272 2018-07-04 20:48:24 Ahhh so next step in vlad's plan: stop defending key oil supplying nation's. Thanks Donnie!

2275 2018-07-04 20:48:10 If we invade and take their oil gas prices will go down it's the only way!!!!
2276 2018-07-04 20:48:05 Did you just say last week that Saudi Arabia agreed to produce more oil because you called them? Clearly something isn’t adding up here...
2277 2018-07-04 20:48:01 He is kicking the people out of here same people running from there oh maybe the imperialistic America wants the oil.  
2278 2018-07-04 20:48:00 The structure we have today is promoting laziness. Money is being shares by the central, when the oil money finishes , we will go back to restructuring.

2295 2018-07-04 20:46:50 It's a supply/demand question. When you can't get enough USABLE FUEL (gas, not oil) to satisfy demand, prices rise. Isn't rising prices what you/@JustinTrudeau want? You know, to dissuade people from....living in the 21st century? #socialismsucks

2309 2018-07-04 20:45:47 Well, Venezuela has control of its own oil production, Trump is continuing to run the USA as a personal resource stockpile, he wants fortress America.

He’s living a Christian apocalyptic delusion from the mid-80’s, that just keeps bubbling along in the Southern States.

2332 2018-07-04 20:42:58 Which means Venezuelan oil production going from 1.4mbd to zero in a couple weeks then rebounding to the pre-Chavez level of 3.5mbd in 2-3 years, ending the oil bull market

2347 2018-07-04 20:40:39 Sure. I’m relatively okay with a fully decarbonized economy that still extracts oil for plastics production because the primary threat—CC—wd be eliminated. But petroleum extraction has other impacts beyond CC that are important too.

AMLO’s election has the oil and gas industtry fears that a swing to the left imperils its investments in the country. The majorities in Congress for AMLO’s Morena party could also neuter the strongest checks on his power...
2378 2018-07-04 20:35:44 Oil takes smarts and money. Trump's got neither. And much has been committed or mortgaged to Russian or Chinese oil companies.

2381 2018-07-04 20:35:33 Dear Me,

Check the label, most truffle oil is manufactured with chemically made truffle flavoring by RedHats.  May not be worth guarding.

2385 2018-07-04 20:35:00 So i tried the combination of bha, clay mask and oil cleansing as recommended by @ImanAbdulRahim and guess what it worked wonders!!! Omaigod i can clearly see the result as soon as I washed my face instantly!

It’s a case of duty of care - if you see someone accidentally spill oil and you then step over it then walk off you’re responsible if someone breaks their neck on it.

2394 2018-07-04 20:34:20 vape oil. Please I must see
2395 2018-07-04 20:34:18 My advice: avoid politics and focus on anything else. 

My (late) father put all his $ in oil stocks, & thought they were going to skyrocket, no matter how much we argued. So, he lost 60% of his wealth.

Sometimes a person has a blind spot.
2396 2018-07-04 20:34:17 Mine has been doing the same.. i was recommended jamaican black castor oil treatments. You can get it on amazon or i found mine at marshalls

2404 2018-07-04 20:32:48 There is a sudden swirling sensation; the world turns into oil colors which are flushed into a toilet.

It lasts but a moment.

And then the angel finds herself in a room of red velvet and shining brass. There is a pleasant dimness to the room. No sources of light are possible -

2407 2018-07-04 20:32:36 Understand your point, but think the blow-back from military action would undermine its success. Apparently, prior to the protests of 70s, the CIA took out leaders like Madura if the US had interests in the region. I think oil is a greater motivation than reducing immigration.
2408 2018-07-04 20:32:35 Mention journalist held without trials, 

You buy fuel @ N145, thank ur star, if ur party was in power till now, you would have been refugee in Ghana or Zimbabwe.

With Reserve reduced from $45bn to $29bn when oil price was $129/barrel

What would have happened when oil was $28
2409 2018-07-04 20:32:20 Yup. That pack would be renamed a ball sack. Sorry
2410 2018-07-04 20:32:07 Wait I thought Russia was a petro state whose entire economy is based on oil export. Which means it’s bad for Putin when The United states exports oil. So wouldn’t putin rather the anti-fossil fuel party be in power?
2411 2018-07-04 20:32:03 Trust me, I've been keeping an eye on him. The archangel blade is tucked close by. Holy oil is easily accessible.
2412 2018-07-04 20:32:03 Tengo que ir a echar gas oil
2413 2018-07-04 20:31:57 I agree that it's political reality that all elected officials have to carry water for the oil industry here, but the cultural consensus that oil is our messiah and we need to sacrifice even more for it is based on a lot of Klein era lies.
2414 2018-07-04 20:31:52 Oil drilling is up 35% yet we are paying 28% higher gas prices...THANK YOU TRUMP.
2415 2018-07-04 20:31:17 I woke up at 6:55 am today to get my oil changed. I got home at 9:45 am. Slept at 10:00 am. Woke up at 3:00pm.
2416 2018-07-04 20:31:16 What people need to realise is that ALL politicians are corrupt pieces of shit. Even if it's as small taking a bit of money to push through a building application or as big as going into a country for oil. Once they realise that the elite want us to hate one another things change

2421 2018-07-04 20:30:22 UAE/Qatar use their oil money to fund player transfers of Mancity/PSG. Madrid is Spain's establishment club. Only some clubs use their revenue to fund transfer, most dependent on the owner. Other company can be used, I don't know if Juventus uses fiat money or not.
2422 2018-07-04 20:30:18 maybe they should be on the east coast blocking tankers with foriegn oil  from coming in ... after all they aren't regulated like Canadian oil is
2423 2018-07-04 20:30:18 It... really doesn't matter how much they push coal, because industrially, for an _enormous_ amount of reasons, oil & gas is more useful. Talking about every single petrochemical company and most power companies having a stake in this issue vs. this nonsense. Laughable.
2424 2018-07-04 20:30:00 ok ok there will be broccoli in olive oil and garlic and chicken broth on noyol...
2425 2018-07-04 20:29:55 You are so right. Ladies, go get checked! Lovely consultant gave me a clear bill of health after mammogram and ultrasound.  Prescribed starflower oil.  Have yet to google its properties.
2426 2018-07-04 20:29:55 So he starts some shit in South America (Oil Grab). Then people suffer even more, flee, travel thousands of miles..only to end up separated and "housed".
2427 2018-07-04 20:29:47 Interesting! There's a product called Empower plus (I have no affiliate with them) that some of my colleagues use too and CBD oil without THC too into the mix;)
2428 2018-07-04 20:29:35 I hope the castor oil on hair thing, works
2429 2018-07-04 20:29:23 Absolutely right. International media only wants the sensational headlines - oil tanks ablaze/drowned babies of migrants washed up. Libyan housewives struggling to feed families/pensioners queueing in sun for a pathetic 500 ld is not interesting enough. #Libya
2430 2018-07-04 20:29:09 Masa iya turun, bisa share buktinya? pdhl crude oil price dunia naik.
2431 2018-07-04 20:29:04 Stop eating French fries. The oil and grease from them increase it. Weekly deep body massages followed by specific exercise targeting the area helps smooth it out too.
2432 2018-07-04 20:29:02 I have never understood why you idiots deny science? What is your motive? Do you own oil companies? What is in it for you to deny the planet is warming? It’s a fact.
2433 2018-07-04 20:28:46 @CatherineBizTV the WTI Oil ticker on the BNN screen has been showing 74.33 for about an hour now; can you get your tech to fix it?  How come you are using the BizTV handle?

Better safe than sorry, though, eh?

2439 2018-07-04 20:27:49 Anytime my car is acting wierd I just assume that it's because I need to get my oil changed and then wait another month to change the oil anyways. I love being a responsible independent young woman.
2440 2018-07-04 20:27:42 You will have to ask the people who is behind the gas prices. You do know the president doesn't set the gas prices?  Ask oil company. That's why it's high. Just so you know. Please use Google it's your friend.
2441 2018-07-04 20:27:35 That chicken would be nice with some oil and potatoes

2444 2018-07-04 20:27:26 why do we continue to import oil and gas on the east coast from nations that do not share in @NDP ideas or @JustinTrudeau climate action plan? Time for @theJagmeetSingh to look at the whole issue and not just one component. Failing to do so will keep you in third.

2456 2018-07-04 20:25:31 The reason climate denial is so rampant is because they take soooo much money from the oil & gas industry, which is a very strong incentive to deny reality in favor of profits. And that level of corruption used to be a crime before Citizens United.

I'm more concerned about Ontario PM Ford, cancelling the Cap and Trade.
2473 2018-07-04 20:23:25 Definitely glad I grabbed some oil yesterday. Perfect day...
2474 2018-07-04 20:23:11 Also just noticed despite telling your service centre, they have not even topped the oil despite being low level and so quickly being a brand new car , problems after problems and sub-standard service
2475 2018-07-04 20:22:46 Yes! The oil absorbs so much faster but lasts as long as the regular cocoa butter. So clutch

2498 2018-07-04 20:19:20 International market controls the fuel oil price which delivered price is converted to Rand. Government adds taxes. Margin is driven by fuel production, delivery & service station costs. Govt does not set fuel price it is formalistic result of these factors.

2503 2018-07-04 20:19:07 I’m in deepwater drilling, so I think about how that will play an important role supplying future large oil discoveries needed to continue to drive growth and advancement until we can actually get off fossil fuels, not pretend get off like they think now.
2504 2018-07-04 20:19:05 Yes it spurred development, however vacancy rates are strongly tied to the ebb and flow of the oil market, just look at YYC. Edmonton is destined to be the hub for oil, and they will fill.. eventually. I wish it was faster, but we have no control of that.

2509 2018-07-04 20:18:52 For 16yrs (1999 to 2015)of PDP/Atikus ruling in d country,nigeria made $800bn on oil sales alone which when used judiciously would ve build all d infrastructure we need in d country but in d end, they looted all d money.

2511 2018-07-04 20:18:30 Dear @LeoDiCaprio ,
I am a parliamentarian and President of an ecological party in Congo. I was the first to denounce the oil exploitation at Virunga Park. You have also made your fight and I am happy. I would like to get in touch with you to create a better synergy. Thank you...
2512 2018-07-04 20:18:26 $TRE.MC
Vendidas, 14%+ en 8 meses más que nada por casualidad o el precio del oil; no me siento cómodo con los fundamentales y el upside lo veo más limitado en el escenario más alcista posible,, los clientes de Middle East se pueden comer parte del cash.
2513 2018-07-04 20:18:20 Thulani shares his views about the oil prices: ...How can the ANC speak to itself? #NightTalk @GugsM
2514 2018-07-04 20:18:17 Global warming is bullshit and without coal and oil companies we would not have made so many technological advances or enjoyed the kind of life we have today.
2515 2018-07-04 20:18:10 the fact that I need an oil change is giving me way too much anxiety. probably should just sell my car instead
2516 2018-07-04 20:18:08 I agree production ag IS a National Security Matter.  This old dude remembers the early OPEC days of the 70's - gas lines / shortages.  Those were troublesome times - however, what was stated then remains true now - you can't eat oil - food security first.
2517 2018-07-04 20:18:06 It's not just her to worry about, but the hordes of idiots that will buy into the snake oil she's selling. Bernie was written off as a joke at first. By the end of the primaries he could have very realistically beat Trump in the general, if the DNC had not sabotaged him.
2518 2018-07-04 20:18:06 Good Man!  I guess you don't get out much..do you only get FOX on your TV.  Wake up sir.  Trump has sold snake oil to all of you.  Please don't invoke the Lord. I am a Christian, and Trump is a disgrace.
2519 2018-07-04 20:17:54 "I don't care about the oil, I Always feel much better whenever you're around" he said and kept hugging his girlfriend
2520 2018-07-04 20:17:47 I’m olive oil in the sheets and balsamic in the streets...
2521 2018-07-04 20:17:31 Buff and oil the shit out of them
2522 2018-07-04 20:17:28 i should’ve put “tired of paying too much for an oil change? today you can get an oil change for half the price”
2523 2018-07-04 20:17:20 also fwiw plastics are only 4% of our oil use
2524 2018-07-04 20:17:20 Tinned in extra virgin olive oil, delicious 
2525 2018-07-04 20:17:15 Nigeria is an oil rich country, yet it has the highest number of outta school children & the number is a staggering 10million children. Isn't this fact sickening?
2526 2018-07-04 20:17:03 You might be right.  If we assume it is not for humanity reason then in must be for some other reason. My best guess is oil
2527 2018-07-04 20:16:56 yes, like reduced defense spending, no more wars for profit, no more subsidies to Big Oil and the drug and airline industries, no more tax breaks to billionaires, no more huge Republican deficits,no more costly trips to Mar Largo, no more First Class seats for Trump officials,etc
2528 2018-07-04 20:16:48 And what happened next? Biggest recession on record, soaring unemployment (13% now),, rising inequality, the world's most indebted oil company. Squandered opportunities.
2529 2018-07-04 20:16:42 US Closing prices: #DOW -0.54% #NASDAQ -0.00% #Ftse100 -0.27% #GBPUSD 1.323 #EURGBP 0.8808 #EURUSD 1.1654 #Gold 0.37% #Oil 0.24%
2530 2018-07-04 20:16:41 Nooooo!!! Say it isn't so! Okay, I joke. I'm sure the assholes that constructed & delivered this shit bill knew they were fucking over average Americans & selling them snake oil. Their greed is boundless. Voters with GOP candidates need to wake TF up & vote them out.
2531 2018-07-04 20:16:41 She hugs him back “How do you feel now that I put the oil in? “ she asked.

2534 2018-07-04 20:16:24 Listen my dudes. Coconut oil. Whatever problem you have, that's the answer. It's how I have my great hair, and how I never have razerburn. Get on the wave.
2535 2018-07-04 20:16:15 Can't sleep? Use lavender essential oil in your bath. You will sleep like a baby.
2536 2018-07-04 20:16:05 If you’ve never combined lotion and baby oil to moisturize your legs, I’m sorry for your skin.

2538 2018-07-04 20:16:02 What creatures
2539 2018-07-04 20:15:59 fave part of daily routine: BODY OIL
2540 2018-07-04 20:15:46 Mix 1 cup babaganoosh with 2 quarts hamburger . Add Olive Oil. Boil. Serve over kale.
2541 2018-07-04 20:15:42 I've long known America had some hellacious karma coming. So much killing in the name of corporate greed: Vietnam was a Death Merchants' war, IMO. Iraq was Bush/Cheney sacrificing thousands of US soldiers & Iraqis to protect Corp. Oil assets. Death sells.
2542 2018-07-04 20:15:33 Alan, should ask dealership if vehicle only takes high octane fuel 92-93 and if motor oil is conventional or synthetic??? Enjoy!!!
2543 2018-07-04 20:15:29 You complain the price of gas is hi, don't want to drill for oil in USA, now you complain about a country we've been buying oil from for many decades, you'll never be happy, you need to walk everywhere
2544 2018-07-04 20:15:19 Our oil is property of Libyans
2545 2018-07-04 20:15:12 Manuel Pellegrini says U.S. has not thought about consequences of Iran oil ban IRNA
2546 2018-07-04 20:15:09 The "super majors" always make the mistakes of selling the assets in the north-sea dirt-cheap to medium-smaller oil comps... PMO bought the EON assets for 120m a while back in 2016, and they are now worth 1bn+ with 30k boepd from them... A steal.!
2547 2018-07-04 20:15:03 Koshary is more than "cuisine", it's a way of life. And totally illogical food, like mix of pastas (3 or 4 different), rice, chickpeas, linsen, grilled garlic, spicy oil, etc, etc. Gluten much? 
2548 2018-07-04 20:14:56 Whenever I’m in a client office and they have a large model of an oil tanker on display, and they’re in neither the petrochemical or transport business, I can’t help but think of the model of the Liparus from The Spy Who Loved Me, and I start looking for men with steel dentures.
2549 2018-07-04 20:14:52 I just saw the #FailureInChief declare he wasn’t ruling out military action in #Venezuela. I just heard he also asked aides about invading Venezuela last yearI keep reading abt closed door meetings with Putin, no media allowed, of course

Want their oil, do ya, #Putin?
#Russia
2550 2018-07-04 20:14:48 Do some research and you'll find out that the amount of money we spend on people who can't or don't work is a tiny fraction of the money we give away to corporations and rich people. We pay oil companies 10s of millions to find new spots to drill for oil. That's the prob.
2551 2018-07-04 20:14:46 Too much oil
2552 2018-07-04 20:14:44 Big oil pushing that one Venezuelan oil yum yum
2553 2018-07-04 20:14:37 @EmmaJackson57 
You realize that all your gear is most likely made from oil products
2554 2018-07-04 20:14:34 PSA: Stop putting coconut oil on your face !!! :/
2555 2018-07-04 20:14:26 In the last 100 miles I saw nothing but oil wells and antelope. (Douglas WY - Gillette WY). #GoneRiding #GrapeSwisherBreak
2556 2018-07-04 20:14:25 Because they are paid indirectly through foreign oil interests to do so.
2557 2018-07-04 20:14:16 I need an oil tycoon in Ghana to adopt me real quick
2558 2018-07-04 20:14:15 Send my bending to your new lover. Truncate Olive Oil lovelier.
2559 2018-07-04 20:14:14 A whole gallon of crisco oil
2560 2018-07-04 20:14:12 They have oil.. So it is possible...
2561 2018-07-04 20:14:09 Oilsands will be fine. Production continues to climb. Oil by rail is breaking records because special interest groups don’t like pipelines. Endbridge line 3 will be done next year. Keystone XL will be in construction phase as will Trans Mountain. Next will be Eagle Spirit.
2562 2018-07-04 20:14:06 Rub olive oil on the tip of your nose
2563 2018-07-04 20:14:03 U are talking about the freaking industrial revolution here. Massive increases in productivity due to technology. Gvt regulation a minor factor. The creation of the entire oil sector for god sake.
2564 2018-07-04 20:13:30 IMPORTS of oil INTO the U.K. 
Imports. Our own U.K. oil. An import.
2565 2018-07-04 20:13:30 PM #Trudeau can you shut off my portion of the  #TransMountain pipeline as I do not want any oil running threw it
2566 2018-07-04 20:13:28 Fact is I don’t need to know you. The fact that you recycle at all tells me you live a modern lifestyle, enjoy plastic, ( made from oil) have aluminum cans ( processed with oil) and you responded on cell or computer, made possible by oil, and powered by oil! Hypocrisy
2567 2018-07-04 20:13:27 Castro has stolen our oil for 20 years, while killing and starving our people.
2568 2018-07-04 20:13:05 オリーブ界の頂点はここだよ。
2569 2018-07-04 20:13:01 Plastic comes from oil. Childrens's toys are made from plastic. Are you against children having toys? #ClimateChange #GlobalWarming
2570 2018-07-04 20:12:54 White people that you hate aren't your neighbors or lawyers
They're the Rockafellers, Rothschilds, Bushes, and royals
They're the people who monopolize the water and oil
And injected your communities with drugs 'til they spoil
2571 2018-07-04 20:12:40 There's a lot of hype about olive oil, but there's a lot of truth to the hype. Some of it, the bottle is worth more than the oil. The last lot was green with sludge in the bottom, that was very nice. I like balsamic vinegar, good stuff I can drink from the bottle.
2572 2018-07-04 20:12:36 Blh kasi bukti bhw yg g suka ORBA adalah antek PKI? ORBA byk masukin perusahaan oil & gas, tambang asing, apakah yg ga setuju dgn kebijakan ORBA ini dianggap PKI? JKW, JOHANAN & LBP nego saham Freeport apa mereka antek PKI?
Tabloid OBOR yg fitnah JKW adlah PKI, it tabloid hoax.
2573 2018-07-04 20:12:36 Maaaaan I KNEW my body needed that fish oil in that salmon. Ain’t been eating my salmon like I was. It’s on now!!
2574 2018-07-04 20:12:15 People will only look at money. U make 20k a year more but commute 45min each way u losing money by the time u add gas, oil changes, damage on ur car, and time wasted
2575 2018-07-04 20:12:12 How much do you think he’s looking for Rob?
2576 2018-07-04 20:12:08 in your dream. oil your propaganda machine well. we ll not talk till election day.
2577 2018-07-04 20:12:05 Is this before or after we seize Iraq's oil?
2578 2018-07-04 20:11:54 I don't know how they can get away with it. 
Every time I tip my old mower oil down the drain it takes weeks to get rid of.
2579 2018-07-04 20:11:48 I said the same it's drying out like an old brillo pad needs some oil moisturiser or summat rubbing thru it!! 
2580 2018-07-04 20:11:47 “Here “ She Said as she grabs the oil and she pulls up How shirt and she opens his stomach and she puts it in his mouth and then it goes down to his stomach and she closes it and she looks at the energy level and it goes to good.

2582 2018-07-04 20:11:27 Hey do u know the thing that you  use to hang is petroleum based.and lets just buy some saudi oil instead.
2583 2018-07-04 20:11:27 4 days!! It took the plumber 4 days to unblock my sink. 4 days with no water, no clean plates, no clean cups, no tap water. The next person (whether you be best friend or just a visitor) to pour coconut oil down my sink will be forced to drink the water from the pipe!!
2584 2018-07-04 20:11:25 Don't "pour" more oil into fire Mr Trump 
2585 2018-07-04 20:11:18 I'm watching news. I've H2O 2deal with! Millions spent on the Astrodome! Why can't U create a conduit system 2 move water out 2 the Gulf? Oil pipeline stretch across the USA & we can't do a conduit system 2 move water? Nationwide many have drought. No 1 cares about solutions!
2586 2018-07-04 20:11:14 I want one of those raining oil lamps from 1977
2587 2018-07-04 20:11:12 لأ انا باحط tan oil
2588 2018-07-04 20:11:09 @channelstv @KadariaAhmed Every current and serving government will always shy away from restructuring because none is ready to loose the cash crow economic source which is oil. Regional government will make state to think outside the box.

2589 2018-07-04 20:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza for lunch today will be: moist crust with stale coconut oil and spinach.
2590 2018-07-04 20:10:58 Kia just lowkey schooled me on how to change my oil 
2591 2018-07-04 20:10:56 They have abundance of oil and very few people . Not a good model for 66m  uk people
2592 2018-07-04 20:10:54 Love is a bit like the new towel on my way home from the airport and I can make it to the other side of the road with your oil case of emergency might

2601 2018-07-04 20:09:49 Just what we need. Another snake oil peddler.
2602 2018-07-04 20:09:23 Hi, @ClarksonsGlobal  
How privat investor can receive reports "Oil Services Quarterly"?
BR
Goran
2603 2018-07-04 20:09:20 Mechanic Vale back at it wit an oil change .
2604 2018-07-04 20:09:20 Support US intervention in Vzla. "Oh the would take the oil and leave" No, why just take the oil and "leave". It would be better to improve the oil industry and maximize the profit, making jobs for engineer who left the country, making the PIB grow, increasing the economic grow.
2605 2018-07-04 20:09:19 Our entire way of life is provided by consumption of oil by-products. Oil is  why we have internet & tv, cars, cell phones, antihistamines, hearing aids, heart valves, contact lenses, jet travel, etc. We'd all be getting water from wells & streams, traveling by horse, etc.
2606 2018-07-04 20:09:15 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
2607 2018-07-04 20:09:10 My mom is really diffusing lavender oil for our dog bc of the fire works  a queen
2608 2018-07-04 20:09:07 First a deal about the warming seas and easier access to Russian oil. The Appropriations Committee is in line to "appropriate" and they all get paid.
2609 2018-07-04 20:09:04        adey die.
 he say oil
2610 2018-07-04 20:09:03 Yeah, here in Norway, the country owes a lot of money. As in, currently we owe... Oh wait, it's the other way around! Our "oil fund" is currently at $1,018,630,805,500 (That's $1 trillion) So yeah, healthcare for all, and free education will definitely ruin a country...
2611 2018-07-04 20:08:53 Lol its actually correct,ask any mechanical, structural or civil engineer, but I'm not justifying this,I'm just explaining the engineering logic behind it,using structural analysis with d container as a load and d truck as d cantilever in which d load is uniformly distributed
2612 2018-07-04 20:08:34 Let's not kid around,  this would be for the oil, after all Russia took over Crimea. Duh
2613 2018-07-04 20:08:31 I legit loved Ryse co-op coliseum. Way underrated, and now with the BR craze, we could dial it up to 100 player swords, lions, and hot oil trap insanity!
2614 2018-07-04 20:08:22 Low key wanna just get blotting paper and help my sis with that oil, so she can look even fire #loveisland
2615 2018-07-04 20:08:14 We have not imported oil from Iran since 2000.
2616 2018-07-04 20:08:14 ان شاء الله توصل بالف سلامه
2617 2018-07-04 20:08:11 it's incredible honestly, a marriage of oil and water, one part can only infuriate the other's fanbase
2618 2018-07-04 20:08:02 Coco powder, coconut oil, and stevia. Melt mix and chill. You are welcome.
2619 2018-07-04 20:07:55 It’s horrible! I even have to avoid extra virgin olive oil. It totally slipped my mind the other day at dinner and I had a few sips of a dirty martini. 3 double doses of meds later, I was still breaking out w/red streaks everywhere. Almost went to the hospital  RIP Olives
2620 2018-07-04 20:07:49 It seems from observation that most of that is probably fracking related.  Expect that to be cyclical on the oil price.  Relatives of mine are driving 2 hours each way from central WV to northern WV for fracking jobs.  Is that sustainable in any way?
2621 2018-07-04 20:07:43 Yes but they were fools and everyone knows we're too smart to be taken in by a charismatic nitwit that sells the finest snake oil in all the land.
2622 2018-07-04 20:07:39 What about the 34 oil tankers that left from Venezuela?
2623 2018-07-04 20:07:17 ... it's not enough, and Japan suddenly had to take oil power stations out of mothballs and launch a crash build of gas generators.

This is not good. Japan has no fossil fuel resources (not strictly true, e.g. there's a gas field in Tokyo Bay that coincidentally ... 6/
2624 2018-07-04 20:07:17 How many shareholders does it take to change an oil industry? Join me and @Steven_Croft tomorrow (Thursday) around 0850 on @BBCr4today as we discuss strategies for responsible investors.
2625 2018-07-04 20:07:14 they are protesting oil that came through 50 year old pipes and nothing new. Get a grip
2626 2018-07-04 20:07:05 Because my seatbelt saved my life. I had internal bruises on my belly, scratches on my chest, and a spill of oil on my leg. My sister who was watching me had three broken toes.
2627 2018-07-04 20:07:02 I’m a member of the fresh pressed olive oil club.  Every 3 months I get a shipment from different parts of the world.  This guy goes all over the globe  looking for good stuff.
2628 2018-07-04 20:06:51 Venezuela has large amounts of natural oil
2629 2018-07-04 20:06:42 And there is nothing the government can do cos the crude prices are controlled by OPEC. Then when the rand is weak against the dollar, it becomes even more expensive to buy that oil using dollar/rand exchange rate because the oil is an import sold at dollar rate.
2630 2018-07-04 20:06:41 I meant about the #WalkAway tag
2631 2018-07-04 20:06:34 Caster oil be blessing my beard
2632 2018-07-04 20:06:09 £140 for a service and all they did was change the fucking oil which I could have done myself, Jesus fucking christ
2633 2018-07-04 20:06:07 Feeling safer? Seriously? I still hear news everyday about drugs, rape, robbery and so on. How about bad economy? High inflation rate? Its actually not people who are rising, its basic commodities like fares, oil and so on.
2634 2018-07-04 20:06:03 The Economist meant to say: Trump is using the oil mkts strategically to achieve changes to the Russian and, mainly, Iran’s activities. That’s why he stimulated the USA domestic oil industry with tax breaks, opened massive new lands for drilling, and approved huge pipeline deals.
2635 2018-07-04 20:06:01 I will be on he lookout for the Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil XL size.
2636 2018-07-04 20:05:53 Venus lotion, pears baby oil are all available. Man go dey alright last las.
2637 2018-07-04 20:05:52 I cut thin slices of tofu and smoked tofu and put:
Maggi sauce, pepper, herbes de provence (and beet juice for color)
And towards the end of cooking a little olive oil;)
2638 2018-07-04 20:05:47 Hey, have you seen Tum Pool's video about this? It's interesting.
2639 2018-07-04 20:05:39 Maybe he thinks he can take their oil
2640 2018-07-04 20:05:39 The Economist meant to say: Trump is using the oil mkts strategically to achieve changes to the Russian and, mainly, Iran’s activities. That’s why he stimulated the USA domestic oil industry with tax breaks, opened massive new lands for drilling, and approved huge pipeline deals.
2641 2018-07-04 20:05:36 I know...we should consider those mirrors too....we have one out past barstow....boils oil I think in a closed system...looks pretty cool!
2642 2018-07-04 20:05:31 Commodity trading in 2008:    Oil.

Commodity trading in 2018:    EOS RAM.
2643 2018-07-04 20:05:26 Maybe a bit of coconut oil or some shea butter?
2644 2018-07-04 20:05:25 Why, to steal their oil?
2645 2018-07-04 20:05:21 I’m willing to bet my entire family’s oil field, camels, pyramids, and olive oil trees that my parents know the parents of those who have ‘Palestinian’ in their bio on social media.
2646 2018-07-04 20:05:15 DO NOT TALK ABOUT INVADING VENEZUELA
OR TAKING THEIR OIL
(He wants to take their oil, doesn't he)
2647 2018-07-04 20:05:15 Of couse we haven’t thought through the consequences of an Iranian oil embargo. Have you even noticed who we elected here?
2648 2018-07-04 20:05:09 Trumps Scraps Obama protections for our oceans for oil drilling. Get ready to vote Trump and his party out of office for they are a threat to everything important in our society.
2649 2018-07-04 20:05:07 Ostensibly the worst fashion trends ever after big hair, baggy jeans & the crop top. Let them go.
2650 2018-07-04 20:04:59 Try Vismaya maitreya oil it is sibirian tree or eucalyptus Vismaya maitreya is better available in candys but oil much better
2651 2018-07-04 20:04:50 yea thought about asking them to rotate the tires when i get my oil change.  just in case
2652 2018-07-04 20:04:50 The Economist meant to say: Trump is using the oil mkts strategically to achieve changes to the Russian and, mainly, Iran’s activities. That’s why he stimulated the USA domestic oil industry with tax breaks, opened massive new lands for drilling, and approved huge pipeline deals.
2653 2018-07-04 20:04:44 Chili oil on the nuts. The birds can't taste it and you get the fun to watch the squirrels trying to wipe it off on the grass.
2654 2018-07-04 20:04:44 First oil change by myself on my 2006 ml350. Wish me luck! #totaledmazda #nowmercedes
2655 2018-07-04 20:04:38 Watched @SsssamanthaaMUA sheer lipstick video yesterday. Popped in to Nordstrom Rack and they had one shade of the @YSL Tint n oil and you bet your bottom dollar I snagged that so fast!!! It’s soooo good!!! 
2656 2018-07-04 20:04:34 Happy Independence Day from The OIL!

2659 2018-07-04 20:04:19 Olive oil
2660 2018-07-04 20:04:15 I like olive oil in moderation. I have a Greek friend, their family picks from their grove in Halkidiki and cold press the stuff. It would run down the street from their door. They'd drink the stuff, I just can't do it. The thought of Italian oil made her sick, very patriotic.
2661 2018-07-04 20:04:13 
2662 2018-07-04 20:03:54 They also have oil
2663 2018-07-04 20:03:40 I think you meant to say: Trump is using the oil mkts strategically to achieve changes to the Russian and, mainly, Iran’s activities. That’s why he stimulated the USA domestic oil industry with tax breaks, opened massive new lands for drilling, and approved huge pipeline deals.
2664 2018-07-04 20:03:39 We can use the old Underground Railroad passage. Or, just ride the oil pipelines.
2665 2018-07-04 20:03:35 Low-THC products (0.3% THC and below) will not have excise tax apply to them. For cannabis oil I believe that equates to 3mg/ml THC or below.
2666 2018-07-04 20:03:33 KAI always cooks really spicy curry with a lot of chili oil to it... It BURNS!;;
2667 2018-07-04 20:03:32 So like, that oil tanker that exploded who owns it? We've moved on?
2668 2018-07-04 20:03:31 That pretty much sums up this issue. The complainers are obviously ignorant of the workings of our government. Oil is heavily subsidized. Agriculture. The corporate tax code is a huge subsidy itself. But these policies bark on command. We need educated lol, not trained dogs.
2669 2018-07-04 20:03:28 We do understand.The ANC can direct policies of the state,so the ANC can influence the decisions nd direct hw government must run.The only thing that people don't undrstand is that crude oil price increases monthly,thus buying it will be expensive for petrol producing companies.
2670 2018-07-04 20:03:21 Oh no  pure tea tree oil on its own  needs to be diluted with water or a carrier oil
2671 2018-07-04 20:03:15 Small pieces of paper or cotton soaked in oil put under coals and light make sure coals r in a pyramid shape and pushed toward the center
2672 2018-07-04 20:03:14 Do. Not. Do. It. Lol trust me girl!! Raspberry leaf tea and primrose oil in pill form did the trick for me
2673 2018-07-04 20:03:02 If Dicks had any balls, they would quit selling ALL firearms, ammo and accessories. No cleaning kits, scopes, mounts, slings, oil...nothing. What say you @dickssportingss ??

2676 2018-07-04 20:02:33 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other.
2677 2018-07-04 20:02:26 Most of the fuel and oil spills on west coast happen during fuel barge transport and fishing vessel fuelling in FN coastal villages.  Why don't you lobby your fossil duel addicted brothers to stop using it?
2678 2018-07-04 20:02:15 Just keep cooking in it and it should eventually go away. Always store it with a layer of oil rubbed in.
2679 2018-07-04 20:02:09 You can help yourself with goya oil or shea butter...

2683 2018-07-04 20:01:27 don't forget #suffolkhour to check the levels in your vehicles, the heat can use a lot of coolant and screenwash and a breakdown in this weather can be as dangerous as winter snow if stranded, check, oil, tyres, coolant, screenwash and of course fuel and carry lots of water

2688 2018-07-04 20:00:42 Why aren’t we ramping up production by Sasol, so that the oil price doesn’t have as much of an impact? Sasol was built with tax payers’ $$$!
2689 2018-07-04 20:00:36 No oil wealth, are growing phenomenally. The bulk is textbooks, housing, transportation and communications systems work.
2690 2018-07-04 20:00:32 Yeah sorry for bringing a disease accidentally when no one knew how disease even worked. Sorry for trying to mitigate dependence on oil from nations that throw gays off buildings and saw the clitoris off young girls.

2706 2018-07-04 19:58:58 Yes, but I’m suggesting those countries have a huge air conditioning load that is powered by electricity generated by burning oil, hence the inordinate CO2 emissions per capita.

2718 2018-07-04 19:58:05 What? Does he want their oil? He thinks we can invade countries and steal their natural resources.
2719 2018-07-04 19:58:00 Absolutely NO reason for the summit. @DNC @SenateDems know this is stamp of approval from Moscow. Solidifying sanction removal, support of Assad, dismantling of NATO, EU, let’s see, more oil fields, a cacophony of power-Team Kakistocracy
2720 2018-07-04 19:57:55 But he is surely interested in the oil.

2732 2018-07-04 19:57:07 Russia’s Rosneft is partnered with Imperial oil and Exxon Mobil and Chinese companies own stakes in the tarsands. Let’s make that fact known.
2733 2018-07-04 19:56:49 And probably still does, remember that’s where the oil is$$$
2734 2018-07-04 19:56:46 I would blame this decrease on the death of the oil/gas industry in Alberta (I.e. carbon tax, increased cost, lack of incentives, government negligence). Maybe not 100% but likely 99.99%
2735 2018-07-04 19:56:39 And he will keep all the oil!
2736 2018-07-04 19:56:38 After the cost of lives lost in ridiculous, perpetual oil wars the least the government could do is make gas Free on independence day (I kno that's not how it works, but come on)

2738 2018-07-04 19:55:48 A woman I met in Cuba said her cousin came to the US, walked into a Publix and started to cry. She had never seen so much food in one place.
In Cuba they get their punch card for monthly rice, beans & cooking oil and are glad to have it. No economic degree needed to understand.
2739 2018-07-04 19:55:47 "Make all of Europe dependent on Russian oil. Disband NATO and roll over, as Russia does the domino over every country in their sphere.  After that, we'll see."
2740 2018-07-04 19:55:46 Yes! Why? Strange. I think this is about the Artic oil reserves.
2741 2018-07-04 19:55:37 China has massive refining capacity and they can buy cheaper refined product from opec. What we have to offer is the lowest grade product available which is troubling since we have no lower floor to sink to so this entire pipeline could potentially lose money if oil droppedenough
2742 2018-07-04 19:55:31 Russia Is Raking in 5 Times (!) the Money From Oil Exports in 2018 It Thought It Would

Russia planned for $40 oil, instead it's going for $60-$80. With Russia's progressive taxation system that translates into 5 times the projected budget revenue from oil

2746 2018-07-04 19:55:07 Why would we want to do that? There is zero strategical importance besides oil. But that would be against international law.

2759 2018-07-04 19:53:38 Cost is just under $10 for my pickup, even with a bone-dry 135L tank. What has had much more impact is the gouging at the pumps by oil and gas companies.

2761 2018-07-04 19:53:37 Soco, a listed oil and gas company in the London Stock Exchange is behind all this. Such a shame from the international community. I hope the Belgian prince mandated with the conservation of Virunga will fight on, take this battle to the global stage.

2773 2018-07-04 19:52:41 If more people knew how to cook wedge fries right, I'd agree. You have to get the oil hot enough & cook them for long enough. Crinkles at their best just aren't as good as the other three at their best, but wedges are so easy to ruin.
2774 2018-07-04 19:52:23 People are "happy" based on genetics. In a study of recently paralyzed individuals; happiness returned to baseline within 1 year.

2782 2018-07-04 19:51:15 You spelled “sell snake oil” wrong there mate 
2783 2018-07-04 19:51:08 Catch me on @SkyBusiness at the top of the hour talking US #stocks #oil #copper and more.
2784 2018-07-04 19:51:02 Wait a minute, $3500 dollars (per paper) of public money to publishing companies with profit margins bigger than oil companies is hardly an optimal solution either. Need to talk about pre-print repositories if you’re interested in the public good.
2785 2018-07-04 19:51:00 Nice one! If you like them a bit more coloured let us know next time, we use fresh veg oil each day & they are fresh, new potatoes from down the road in Chorley so they are pale due to the clean oil & white spud, but we can fry them longer if you let us know that’s what you like
2786 2018-07-04 19:50:53 People always told us as kids that brussels sprouts were gross, leaving out the crucial fact that they are SO DELICIOUS on a grill with olive oil and sea salt and about 6 beers! Adults are weird.
2787 2018-07-04 19:50:41 ```Everything in Ghana is just someway now

2789 2018-07-04 19:50:36 Remember when stalin gave grain and oil to the nazis?
2790 2018-07-04 19:50:35 Again just keep on going. If they get hit it’s there fault. Oh and why are they not being arrested? Hypocrisy at its finest. I hope they aren’t using anything made from oil products.
2791 2018-07-04 19:50:33 i’ve tried baby oil, coconut oil, tanning oil.. it’s not working 
2792 2018-07-04 19:50:30 Putin & the Koch brothers want oil!!!
2793 2018-07-04 19:50:15 I put tea tree oil on to deter hornets. Now I Stink.
2794 2018-07-04 19:50:10 Let’s keep moving that oil by rail instead ! Worry about the demand and supply will take care of itself. Not the other way around.
2795 2018-07-04 19:50:05 Trans Mountain says a vessel carrying crude oil 'departed our Westridge Marine Terminal and is now waiting for suitable conditions at its Port of Vancouver designated mooring location.' Calls disruption of shipping traffic by protesters 'unfortunate.'
2796 2018-07-04 19:49:51 So says @WSJ (farmers and trade) - Some are prepared to sacrifice financially if the U.S. economy benefits in the long run. Seriously?
2797 2018-07-04 19:49:18 the irony...they are using products made from bitumen (oil & gas) to suspend themselves, no hemp and burlap to hang with for those well paid puppet protesters eh!
2798 2018-07-04 19:49:15 With like an old timey wooden motif and proper swing doors. Only lit by oil candles

2801 2018-07-04 19:48:56 C'mon over, comrade! Seriously, I love it when @jkenney demands the reintroduction of Pierre Trudeau's National Energy Program to force corporations to but their oil from Canadian companies. About time!
2802 2018-07-04 19:48:49 Another reason for green and alternative energy. This is the 21st century. Also crude oil is not problem, it’s the refining that can’t keep up. STEM!
2803 2018-07-04 19:48:47 lol ok. If there is an alternative that will actually impact pakistani women in any positive way i'm down for that too
2804 2018-07-04 19:48:45 When I do spaghetti, I like an olive oil sauce.   Minced shallot, a crushed/minced clove garlic.  Lemon juice, Dijon mustard, salt pepper and good olive oil.
2805 2018-07-04 19:48:39 Can you allbelieve this man child, want to be a president has bern asking his aides if he can invade Venezuela?.WTF ..He must think he can just take anyones oil this greedy bastard.I remember him saying in his campaign that we should take Iraq's oil, we still had troops there?.
2806 2018-07-04 19:48:26 Put a couple swears in your rehearsed pitch to make it appear authentic. This is Saskatchewan after all pal, the god damn oil patch baby.
2807 2018-07-04 19:48:21 This smacks a bit in its reception of Lorenzo's Oil.
2808 2018-07-04 19:48:15 Doing it for decades. This is precisely what they did to Iran. Now Iran is back in the oil market it depressed prices, so they've gotta put sanctions back on, can't have Trump's donors losing money,who needs nuclear non-proliferation & peace anyway? Peace isn't good for business!
2809 2018-07-04 19:48:10 Really? Seventy one percent of tarsands oil is foreign owned. More than half of all Canadian oil and gas revenue goes to foreign countries. Stephen Harper worked very hard to sell out our tarsands to foreign industry. That is NOT okay.
2810 2018-07-04 19:48:07 just applied my spf 15 with oil. Seems like a good idea. Stay tuned for sunburn report. #FourthOfJuly
2811 2018-07-04 19:48:07 They owe us lots of oil.  Nothing should be off the table.
2812 2018-07-04 19:48:06 did you use tanning oil ?
2813 2018-07-04 19:48:03 I wouldn't call it "a war". He would rescue us from international narco/oil mobs, and would prevent them from spreading all over the hemisphere.
2814 2018-07-04 19:47:27 Stabilization is never his goal. Chaos and confusion are what he hides behind.

2815 2018-07-04 19:47:13 I don't know. The value of data is very heterogenous unlike oil that's fungible.
2816 2018-07-04 19:47:10 Oil. Treason, attack our national security again. Though, there is word that the keystone bullshit was funded secretly by Russian. How else was money just dumped into the area and there is hush talk from GOP'ers.

2824 2018-07-04 19:45:42 Luz, zbledną z czasem, a jeśli nie chcesz to zawsze można spróbować bio oil (trochu drogi ale serio przy regularnym stosowaniu nie widać praktycznie ich - sprawdzone na kilkunastu osobach)
Tak btw Myślę że ludzie nie skupią się na nich tylko na Twoich ślicznych nogach i tyłku XD
2825 2018-07-04 19:45:37 @bctoday #the government should take the 10 billion dolalare and help people put solar on their house. That would create thousands of permanent jobs. You guest is obviously pro oil company
2826 2018-07-04 19:45:21 Oil. It's all about the oil. So unsurprising that The Combover-In-Chief would target this country. He's coocoo for Koch Bros.
2827 2018-07-04 19:45:20 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
2828 2018-07-04 19:45:14 Sorry to "budge in" but also add Olive oil hey on your oils (length+ texture). Since your hair is still small, do hot oil treatment( warm up coconut oil and apply it on your scalp for like 2/3 times a week. Your hair will be healthy and strong.

2830 2018-07-04 19:45:09 I thought the U.S. was going to stay out of other countries business! Oh wait, unless there is oil involved!
2831 2018-07-04 19:44:49 Would raise the price of Russian oil, yes?
2832 2018-07-04 19:44:46 We sell it to you at a 40% discount.  You resell at full price.  Smart move for you but we can’t get our oil out and the East doesn’t buy it.
2833 2018-07-04 19:44:34 Meat and onions sizzling in oil can be such a distraction.
2834 2018-07-04 19:44:26 And Beach Blanket Bingo ain’t happening either. Ina Garten would serve you shitty store brand olive oil.
2835 2018-07-04 19:44:18 Entitled douchebags
2836 2018-07-04 19:44:12 Presumably this is some sort of tanning oil butt?
2837 2018-07-04 19:44:06 but see, if an oil company isn't profiting from it, is it really productive?
2838 2018-07-04 19:44:03 It’s moments like spilling hot wax all over your hand that remind you that sometimes life is gunna hurt and sometimes you’re not gunna know how to deal with it, but in the end, you’ll find oil and you’ll get that wax off with maybe some tears, but minimal burns.
2839 2018-07-04 19:43:59 Is he talking about a  military #coup? We don’t have a good track record on how those have turned out. #Cuba, #Chile, #Guatemala, #Iran, #Honduras ,... if people want #oil remember #Iraq
2840 2018-07-04 19:43:57 Flip it over before turning it on. Let the oil flow through the bars inside the heater.
2841 2018-07-04 19:43:57 The good old days of driving excursions belting out Chris Isaac, midnight oil, REM to name a few....
2842 2018-07-04 19:43:56 Why did I order a 1/2 gallon of lavender oil. I don’t like lavender :(
2843 2018-07-04 19:43:56 So will US go to war with Venezuela to raise the price of Russian oil? Is that what Putin and Trump are discussing? Just thinking out loud, here.
2844 2018-07-04 19:43:42 Take some fresh peppermint, oil or leaves. That will soothe your tummy. I battled your problem my whole life. Recently learned the peppermint trick. It's old medicine. Moms give it to babies with colic. Works miracles.

2847 2018-07-04 19:43:24 France participated in the destruction of Lybia for oil and gold. France is still stealing.
2848 2018-07-04 19:43:21 Trump wants to invade Iran too. Iran also has oil reserves. It all makes sense in Trump's & Bolton's heads.
2849 2018-07-04 19:43:14 Buhari has not allocated any oil bloc – Kachikwu
This is 1 of d reasons Y d generals r gathering
2850 2018-07-04 19:43:12 It wouldnt just be us. Most of that oil goes to China, Japan, and other east asian nations.
2851 2018-07-04 19:43:04 Wait, are we invading to free the zoo animals everybody is eating or secure the oil reserves there?
2852 2018-07-04 19:42:57 Palmers makes this amazing body oil it legit smells like cookies and makes your skin so so soft it’s all I use!
2853 2018-07-04 19:42:50 Same thing happens with other drugs and consumer foods:  oil, automobile, plastic bags, prescription opiates, but of course Cannabis is the flavour of the month.  How fortunate there is a foreign policy angle to write about.  Foreign Affairs Clickbait on 4th of July.
2854 2018-07-04 19:42:34 Meanwhile the barons of the oil syphon away
2855 2018-07-04 19:42:33 I wanna bathe in bio oil
2856 2018-07-04 19:42:24 I have to make sure the skin is really dry. Temp’s at 325. A slight coating of olive oil helps.

2860 2018-07-04 19:42:05 Omg ok thank you any suggestions for oil??
2861 2018-07-04 19:42:04 They do indeed reduce the risk. However, there have been a number of marine oil spills involving double hulled tankers.
2862 2018-07-04 19:42:00 In terms of oil prices, well worth reading Carbon Tracker @CarbonBubble
2863 2018-07-04 19:41:57 I didn't know July 4th is a holiday in Russia.

How's that quest for delicious oil rubles going?
2864 2018-07-04 19:41:53 You forgot oil rich Venezuela! They’re doing GREAT! The main difference between capitalism and socialism is this: Capitalism works.
2865 2018-07-04 19:41:46 Try a shot of vodka in the batter. Alcohol evaporates instant it hits oil but causes really crispy batter.

2870 2018-07-04 19:41:21 So uKhongolose is calling on government to drop oil prices, like the ANC led government isn't responsible for the pricing policy.
I've never heard them complaining about ministers of Finance adding  levies every year.
2871 2018-07-04 19:41:13 Many environmentalists are. Also when many provinces import oil at a higher cost we should be piping it to Canadians, not away from the country. We should gradually reduce oil consumption. I know it’s circumstantial but Manitoba get most power from Hydro energy.
2872 2018-07-04 19:41:10 Hey, Donnie!  Sounds to me like you're planning to bomb oil pipelines, all in the name of national security!! Did I get that right, @realdonaldtrump?

2888 2018-07-04 19:39:45 Engine oil indicator lights up. I'm an independent woman so I put in a litre of the right kind of oil. Start driving on the motorway. Same indicator lights up again... Car still at garage having cooling circuits cleaned. One of those days indeed!
2889 2018-07-04 19:39:39 Hearing Hoodoo Gurus and Midnight Oil during drive time at THE Amazon Whole Foods proves that they know their customer base, i.e. shoppers who had a radio show in the '80s [raises hand] and/or the kids who grew up with their records.
2890 2018-07-04 19:39:37 Venezuela like Iraq has the deadly WMD called OIL!!
2891 2018-07-04 19:39:30 Hope their kids can breathe in 15 years and that they don’t get poisoned by the filthy water.  Oh, and maybe their Trumpster parents could get videos of the National parks before the oil rigs take over.  Maybe pics of the forests while they are still there.
2892 2018-07-04 19:39:25 thank you Sir.. I am always surprised by my own efforts for the limited tome I put into the object.. the great blank helps.. a bit of sanding and then oil.. #jobdone

2907 2018-07-04 19:37:31 Tiger balm helps me a lot, as do peppermint/eucalyptus/tea tree toothpicks. I recently got an essential oil inhaler to waft under my nose when I'm feeling nervous. You say a positive affirmation about how easy the breath flows and associate the smell with calm.

2909 2018-07-04 19:36:54 Start oil production then, UK will buy it all.
2910 2018-07-04 19:36:51 Now I slapped a fuck ton of coconut oil into it just to keep it kinda healthy before imma bleach it soon
2911 2018-07-04 19:36:50 Most Pakistanis love bilawal and Maryam’s good looks; we just cringe when their parties do bad things, a lot of bad things.
2912 2018-07-04 19:36:49 I’ve stuck a load of patchouli in my oil burner to mask the smell that’s coming in. It might actually be the water treatment plant that’s a few roads away. Musty chemicals 
2913 2018-07-04 19:36:44 Three slash four cup vegetable oil.
2914 2018-07-04 19:36:35 You see a man of God with eight bodyguards and an AK47gun and all he is telling you is you need a sticker or anointing oil to be protected. Help me find sense in this..............

2918 2018-07-04 19:35:23 So now it comes out that Trump suggested the USA invade Venezuela last year!  Sec of State Tillerson and NSA McMaster were reportedly stunned; and it seemed that Trump wasn't ready to take "no" for an answer!  Several times it was mentioned, and Trump wanted to take their oil!

2920 2018-07-04 19:35:08 If a society has allowed itself to eat exclusively beef, what purpose does it serve to target the maker of the beef? Only makes sense if belief is that there is no individual role in our oil addiction, and that we are mere slaves to the oil companies.
2921 2018-07-04 19:35:08 Is there a secret oil well in Kuopio that I don't know about?!

2930 2018-07-04 19:33:55 Lmao yes mf. I can cook, cut wood, fish and hunt, change oil and whatever tf else, any more questions?
2931 2018-07-04 19:33:39 I’m at the point where people ask me what I am doing or going to do, and I say no thing. Because the things I am going to do, or am doing, they don’t care about. Few people care to hear “I’m going to go make some clove infused grape seed oil when I get home”
2932 2018-07-04 19:33:32 If it hasn’t cured yet I’ve seen people use a mixture of baby oil and washing up liquid to get it off brushes… or maybe isopropyl alcohol? good luck!
2933 2018-07-04 19:33:30 This lifelong, Maryland lib is going to forget that she saw this tweet, LOL. I stopped eating @MiracleWhip years ago bc it has soybean oil and high fructose corn syrup in it (double ick), but I would buy it IF they would cleanup their ingredients.

2942 2018-07-04 19:32:58 ok! i think the first treatment essence can stay , but maybe you need more hydration (aloe, propolis maybe?) and you could incorporate an AHA for more exfoliation (the glycolic acid from the ordinary is working realy well for me!!!) also perhaps precleanse with an oil cleanser?

You've been arguing that oil products are everywhere, that we all use them, indeed, there is so much demand that even anti-oil activists must use them.

2990 2018-07-04 19:27:21 Yes, personal choice has played no role in our oil dependence. Oil companies held guns to our heads and forced us to build car-dependent suburbs serviced by overnight Amazon delivery. If only we could stop them we would be fine.

Let he who is without a perfect resume cast the first vote.

3065 2018-07-04 19:18:03 Coconut oil makes blow jobs taste like Almond Joy's. Thank gawd it doesn't taste like a Mounds. I'd rather eat 10 dicks than a Mounds. 
3066 2018-07-04 19:18:02 Yes - and #Mining, #drilling for #oil, #mining the #tarsands, #fracking, #GillNet fishing, razing entire #forests for #agriculture is all part of our #economy and it is fatal to the #Biosphere.
3067 2018-07-04 19:17:57 Whatever, you'd all give shit to a libertarian for using socialized medicine and getting a subsidized post-secondary education. You just dislike the possibility that individual choice has some say in our oil dependence.
3068 2018-07-04 19:17:56 Too true! I have heard CBD oil is really helpful, but I didn’t order any in time...
3069 2018-07-04 19:17:37 Rosehip seed oil is good for sensitive skin type.
3070 2018-07-04 19:17:27 I'm telling y'all. The honey & olive oil ain't no joke.

3072 2018-07-04 19:16:56 Please don't ask to hit the weed today this blunt is laced with pure cbd oil.  The gas was already disrespectful.  Just don't put me back in laurel ridge until after my birthday
3073 2018-07-04 19:16:49 I put coconut oil all over Fiona to help her dandruff and she has been sniffing the house for 10 minutes trying to locate the scent not realizing it’s her own body
3074 2018-07-04 19:16:41 im not going to be happy again until my coconut oil goes back to its solid state
3075 2018-07-04 19:16:36 For oil? We give him half of what is in the country in exchange for taking away the plague that has power today. Oil has been our biggest curse these years.
3076 2018-07-04 19:16:26 I wanna do another oil painting, but I don't have the supplies/setup and don't know who I'd paint.

3084 2018-07-04 19:15:17 bro no point of arguing with idiots who think their club is big because they have oil money.
3085 2018-07-04 19:15:06 Don't understand people who blame their president for increasing oil prices...
3086 2018-07-04 19:15:05 Adding tariff, puting latest boycott on Iran economy including decrease  oil supply from Iran to international markets and  Immigrant Prohibition cause to increase USD currency from 70 up 73.50 thats the highest rates.
3087 2018-07-04 19:15:03 @findlaynapier Hello Findlay, would you mind if I used your version of "Cod Liver Oil In The Orange Juice" on my podcast @_YesterdaysJam_ ? My parents saw you up in Orkney at the folk festival and brought your album back...its brilliant 
3088 2018-07-04 19:14:49 Don't you notice any #African state that discovers any precious mineral suddenly gets entangled in crisis? In Nigeria too the same...Oil discovered in Borno, Gombe,Bauchi, Taraba ...then Boko haram Appeared....Precious lead discovered in Zamfara suddenly "bandits"

3092 2018-07-04 19:13:44 Any rural Jamaican can vouch that oxtail, castor oil, even coconut oil was cheap.

Then the clout came, and everything changed
3093 2018-07-04 19:13:43 I’m gutted... I’ve lost my @Younique_Corp oceanside Lip Oil and it’s now sold out. Never thought I would be emotionally attached to a lip gloss  but I’m genuinely gutted
3094 2018-07-04 19:13:18 Socialist don't care about the environment, they are anti-oil period because they like to keep people in poverty, dependant on government subsidies, they want Canada to become a third world country with the exception that in the 3d world, they still dig for oil in the ground
3095 2018-07-04 19:13:17 An avocado oil face mask can do that too supposedly
3096 2018-07-04 19:13:17 I don't k why, but I suddenly got the cleaning bug for my kitchen cabinets, used Murphy's oil soap to scrub gunk off the sink door, needed a toothbrush to get out the crap. I can pass that mess for days, not notice, suddenly, has to be cleaned right now!
3097 2018-07-04 19:13:14 Brown sugar and honey

Ingredients:
—1 tablespoon raw honey
—1 tablespoon brown sugar
—5-6 drops of lavender essential oil
3098 2018-07-04 19:13:02 do yourself a favour: toast some pita bread in the oven with olive oil + zaatar for a few mins then grate some cheese over it. you're great and you deserve it
3099 2018-07-04 19:13:02 I remember those meetings. Dick Cheney and bush jr were oil and water. Dick Cheney has always been a containment person. That’s why bush jr didn’t pardon scooter Libby.
3100 2018-07-04 19:13:01 Add just enough water to make it sticky, then knead it for about 3-4 minutes, massage a palm full of olive oil into it, cover it and put somewhere warm for 15 minutes.

Then slice it in half, and pull it into a big fucking backing tray.

I like em thick me.
3101 2018-07-04 19:12:53 I hate to say it, but don't you have a steady stream of gasoline-burning vehicles passing directly above you? That gas comes from Alberta oil, over the Trans Mountain pipeline. And BC needs more pipeline capacity - in April we were importing gas from Singapore (!).
3102 2018-07-04 19:12:47 A Blushing Haberdasher purchases an oil painting depicting a gathering of inventors for Echoes. Perhaps you'll leave that out of your report.
3103 2018-07-04 19:12:47 No menial unemployment dropped during Obama’s administration. The coal industry the oil industry fabrication industry. Yeah those signed a 10 year low during Obama’s term.
3104 2018-07-04 19:12:43 Yep which is totally useless - hence the need to research, put it this way I had a medical need to use “oil”
3105 2018-07-04 19:12:42 More oil money and empty seats.. none plastic fans?
3106 2018-07-04 19:12:41 It must be such an annoying life for the sales team of a company who has discovered the actual real health benefits of snake oil.
3107 2018-07-04 19:12:38 For Oily Hair: 
Combine milk, almond oil and oats in a blender. Once you have a paste like consistency apply it to your hair and scalp for 15 minutes before washing your hair.
3108 2018-07-04 19:12:28 That moment your husband texts and asks if you have heard of avocado oil and you realize he is more of a foodie and healthier than you 
3109 2018-07-04 19:12:28 I swear by Lush’s silky underwear powder for chub rub prevention, though I believe a lot of people are fans of plain old coconut oil 
3110 2018-07-04 19:12:23 For Frizzy Hair: 
Mash up half a banana, mix with 2 tablespoons of honey and half a teaspoon of almond oil. Massage through your hair and scalp, let it sit in for 30 minutes then rinse off with your usual shampoo.
3111 2018-07-04 19:12:10 My guess is the similarity to E. Syria - a large inhospitable area with not many people and some oil fields.
3112 2018-07-04 19:12:04 @WholeFoods any plans to change from using canola oil for your prepared foods?
3113 2018-07-04 19:12:04 For Split Ends; 
Mix 2 tablespoons of honey, 1 tablespoon of almond oil and 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar. If you have nut allergy's then you can use coconut oil. Apply to you hair focusing on the ends and leave it in for around an hour then was with shampoo.

3133 2018-07-04 19:09:50 Who determines what-“ordinary land just sitting there”- is? You, lobbyists, oil companies? Who? Why do Utah republicans feel it is their duty, once elected, to sell off public lands? Have a town hall meeting like Chaffetz did and see how happy your constituents are with this idea
3134 2018-07-04 19:09:44 UK Oil & Gas #UKOG is it:
3135 2018-07-04 19:09:04 I've only recently started using CDB oil. I was wondering how that works work due the dreaded girl cramps...
3136 2018-07-04 19:08:47 For the oil of course.
3137 2018-07-04 19:08:33 Super easy.  It’s oil, raw egg, a little lemon juice, salt, ground mustard that’s about it.  Check it out on Pinterest.

3139 2018-07-04 19:08:15 Thank you for your Q.

The #USA doesn’t care less about #Yemen or Yemenis.

US, cares only about two things:

1• how to grab the petrodollars of our oil rich neighbors

2• how to show off in front of its own public with stunt strikes against what it calls “terrorists”
3140 2018-07-04 19:07:53 The Arab nations must not depend upon any one in particular. The way the financial market is manipulated by the EU & the US is an open secret. Look at the recent pressure from Trump on KSA on oil production. Arabs can devise a common market, and govern their own finance &  trade.
3141 2018-07-04 19:07:48 The squirt guns are filled up with hot oil. Come on over.
3142 2018-07-04 19:07:44 Make sure you oil the lock with anointing oil and you’ll be back on track

3149 2018-07-04 19:06:48 @JustinTrudeau choose water and not oil! Canada’s pacific coastline is far more valuable than the oil.
3150 2018-07-04 19:06:37 OR...."Purge: The Ocean" it's the purge but on maritime law so anything can happen. But our anti-hero decides to raid a casino that is held on a oil tanker.

3164 2018-07-04 19:04:48 Actually no. I was more meaning in general about the over acting by players in the sports. Not specifically about him. If a foul is legit it's legit. It's the over the top flopping when there is no contact is mostly what I was referring to.
3165 2018-07-04 19:04:20 Stop getting the idea the Nigerian market is huge, our literacy is in a all time low, our proclaim capitalist economy is no way remotely capitalist, and we're breathing on our long long oil dependence. So stop getting any won't idea

3170 2018-07-04 19:03:23 There's not a giant bucket of oil you can just take and leave, it's in the ground, if Trump wants the oil the you have to take care of it impeding communists to comeback and appropriate it to themselves
3171 2018-07-04 19:03:18 I dropped my phone in a jar of coconut oil and now the speaker won’t work. I’m gonna need some explaining cause I thought coconut oil fixed everything.
3172 2018-07-04 19:03:14 The oil for us was too ceap to think of replacement, but now they started to use solar energy
3173 2018-07-04 19:03:11 4/ New Zealand has the highest GST rate on earth: 19%. But it's still the best destination for business due to good policy.

My homeland Norway has an onerous tax code, with 25% VAT except for food and fish, but it has oil plus other policies that favor businesses/markets.
3174 2018-07-04 19:03:02 Venezuelans are not producing oil there dying from hunger and disease and yes nobody else seems to care.
3175 2018-07-04 19:02:59 If France relies on Oil/Gas from Iran. Uranium fuel rods from Russia for Electricity. What if USA sanctions France for importing from Iran, and Uranium scandal in USA drive ups export prices from Russia. USA imports alot of refined yellowcake from Russia.

3180 2018-07-04 19:02:21 Was the Venezuelan economy more diverse before Chavez? No, and not only was it not more diverse but the revenue from the oil industry were primarily benefiting the wealthiest in Venezuela. And that's the state of affairs the opposition wants to return to.
3181 2018-07-04 19:02:20 Oil painting on canvas? 
3182 2018-07-04 19:02:18 Years from now nobody will have jobs because everyone will be dead. We can thank big oil’s greed for that.
3183 2018-07-04 19:02:16 Hopefully,,drastic monetary and physical policy will happen, preventing a slow down or future recession.
Such as, FOMC halting rate hikes, discontinuing tariffs, and open to foreign investments without restrictions. 
And, oil prices falling, less concern for inflation.

3200 2018-07-04 19:00:34 I just heard that Mr. Trump is thinking of invading Venezuela!  Why! I asked. Because of the government corruption. Corruption!  Does Venezuela has more corruption than the Egyptian government!  Syrian, Libyan, Russian, etc

Venezuela has OIL. I understand.

3202 2018-07-04 19:00:32 1) One of the richest oil reserve nations in the world and the BEST they could do was maintain a third of their people in real poverty? If your stat is indeed true it’s not surprising that gob fiat temporarily alleviated some poverty. Redistribution does benefit some, but since

3204 2018-07-04 19:00:28 My grandparents are finally opening  their mind to CBD oil and using it and I am just so excited.
3205 2018-07-04 19:00:27 Going for an oil change is like visiting WebMd for a cold. The man told me he HAS to fix the tire pressure to me needing a new engine or someshit! DAG JUST CHANGE THE OIL, we good.
3206 2018-07-04 19:00:25 Oil of God God burns the attacks of people who allow the devil to use them. Living in God’s will covers us! Romans 12:1-7 get the negativity off, lay in on the altar of God. And move on, don’t carry what happens today in the next day

3214 2018-07-04 19:00:00 Lol.  It was out of laziness because I didn’t want to go to the store but super easy just don’t use olive oil.  It is too strong.
3215 2018-07-04 18:59:49 Oh that sounds delightful  all of the above, yes!!! For hair moisture, I spray rose water mixed with vitamin E oil and a few drops of tea tree oil every other day/when needed.. a blessing
3216 2018-07-04 18:59:44 Let me rebraid my hair and smother it in coconut oil
3217 2018-07-04 18:59:28 Do you mean the inside it the glass stove top. Vinegar, water, and a little lemon essential oil make great natural grease cutter and cleaner. Inside I do the same but scrub in a little baking soda and water paste first.
3218 2018-07-04 18:59:20 And oil change
3219 2018-07-04 18:59:13 I’ll never forgive them for banning the oil that McDonalds used to make their French Fries.
3220 2018-07-04 18:59:12 Hope no be red oil sha...

3224 2018-07-04 18:58:30 Happy birthday in advance @oil_shaeikh
3225 2018-07-04 18:58:30 IN CONGRESS, JULY 4, 1776 Americans started their quest for personal freedom. Today July 4th 2018 we are still fighting to gain freedom for those who use an herb called cannabis for medicine cloth fiber building material food oil plastic and a huge variety of some 50000 + items
3226 2018-07-04 18:58:29 We need a national program that can help oil find a path to a noncarbon industry.  I would advocate a move to nuclear energy&use as much of their current infrastructure as they can. Pipelines can be storm hardened electrical grid conduits&Thorium reactors can replace oil fields.
3227 2018-07-04 18:58:26 Lavender oil is also great for burns!

Happy 4th of July!
3228 2018-07-04 18:58:06 We have a thundershirt that kind of helps...but she still freaks out and hides. Never thought of using oil.
3229 2018-07-04 18:58:05 If the U.S. can pump oil through pipelines, #Thailand ought to be able to pump water out of a cave. Why can't #China or #Russia step in and help out? They probably have industrial pumping equipment to get those kids out of that cave.
3230 2018-07-04 18:58:03 India has too many people to make that feasible, and that’s why it imports oil
3231 2018-07-04 18:57:57 Coconut oil and warm water!
3232 2018-07-04 18:57:44 Please, @politico, start now. Take all those people that were leaving the country when Trump won the election with you.
3233 2018-07-04 18:57:37 Have you not been paying attention to what has been fired Neymer's way? No one in hockey has ever had that sort of thing thrown their way. Don't get me wrong, I don't like watching that sort of thing either but I'd bet 80%-90% of those dives are still fouls. #Reality
3234 2018-07-04 18:57:34 It was a sea of so-called 'stars' there to pay homage to THEIR President Obama.  That no one is showing up shows the disdain they have for our #military.  Who cares WHO the President is?  We are supposed to be citizens of the SAME country.  This is just so sad. . mostly for them.

3238 2018-07-04 18:57:07 Trouble is that if we even took advantage of the Tourist sites in the Country, dependency on Oil would have taken a back seat. I visited the Museum some time ago and the tour guide kept binding and casting as she talked about the old gods. Wish we had an active tourism head.
3239 2018-07-04 18:57:04 It would be far better to divest from oil, tobacco, alcohol, gambling, weapons, GM crops, nuclear power, etc rather than continue to put church money into it!
3240 2018-07-04 18:57:01 my relationship with my father isn’t great but this man rotated my tires, changed my oil, and cleaned my car 
3241 2018-07-04 18:56:57 Girl cramps. I’ve got THC coconut oil.  Out of Robaxin.
3242 2018-07-04 18:56:57 You can shower everyday and not wash your hair  people don’t use dry shampoo to skip showers, they use it to get rid of oil in your hair when you can’t WASH your hair everyday 
3243 2018-07-04 18:56:56 Small minds with fixated and paid narratives have trouble being progressive. Funny how as a blogger you don’t legally have to show where your income comes from. Perhaps a request of audit by the CRA would change your “pro oil, all environmentalists are evil” tune.
3244 2018-07-04 18:56:51 I cant wait till electric vehicles and solar + battery storage absolutely destroys the oil/gas industry. It's coming and sooner than you think

3249 2018-07-04 18:55:59 Girl have you tried applying rose hip oil to your lashes at night/morning?? I’ve been doing that for a few months now and my eyelashes are longer than ever
3250 2018-07-04 18:55:54 Yeah, she reached the same conclusion I did: equivalent of US military being used to guard the Oil Ministry building in Baghdad after the ‘03 invasion, all while the rest of the city got looted with impunity…

3260 2018-07-04 18:54:58 Why Can't @ANCGovt build a pipeline from UG, KY or SS linking it to Durban or Cape town? A capable CTRY the likes of SA still making crocodile tears bcz of oil price fluctuations when Africa has its own deposits? Stupidity!
3261 2018-07-04 18:54:58 EIA: "Total petroleum consumption averaged about 19.8 million b/d in 2017"
"In 2017, the United States produced an average of about 9.3 million barrels per day (b/d) of crude oil"
3262 2018-07-04 18:54:41 do you think we can hold these levels? I believe the the oil price can sustain it going forward

3266 2018-07-04 18:54:16 A lot of work. After this clown we are going to have to jump start the whole government. Whole agencies have been dismantled. So many good programs ended. Oil companies need to be kicked off fed land

3268 2018-07-04 18:54:02 CBD based over the counter oil products  do not have the required percentages to be medical grade in fact as good as useless , the cannabinol receptors in the body require the 40% THC  to be effective- hence the legal problem

3306 2018-07-04 18:50:58 Soleimani commends Rouhani for his threat to close the Strait of #Hormuz and says: “This is the Mr. #Rouhani we knew and this is the Rouhani we must continue knowing.”

#American hardware is immense in the Gulf, but Iran can still destabilize the gulf and traumatize oil market.
3307 2018-07-04 18:50:57 The greatest fulfillment from #success could be that others have the chance to build upon it.

Success in a cave is simply a lamp that goes out when the oil is finished.
3308 2018-07-04 18:50:51 why England needs Scotland to stay in the UK. With Indy and climate change could Eng do without Scotland’s contribution to the elec grid, oil and now water? This is why Putin bots will be all in for Scots Indy. On top of Brexit, Eng is facing complete disaster.
3309 2018-07-04 18:50:46 While animals are being killed for trophies, our marine life is being attacked by oil companies and most importantly; my kid might get killed at school, the mall, at church or the park etc.
3310 2018-07-04 18:50:41 But if they could, I'd sign up for that shit.  It sounds awesome.
3311 2018-07-04 18:50:40 Iranian president threats to disrupt oil shipments from region countries if Washington forces all countries to stop buying Iranian oil. This is a joke ! Iranian government has even lost its control of governing Iran,how can they disrupt oil shipment from the region !
3312 2018-07-04 18:50:24 Oh but we are climate leaders. The best environmental standards in the world. And we need to make our money in the oil so we can get out of it. Otherwise it’s you and me forking out extra money which some of us don’t have to pay for the transition.
3313 2018-07-04 18:50:11 Yeah...... why the f*** does NOAA need guns.  Not like they can line up along the coast and kill hurricanes before they make landfall.
3314 2018-07-04 18:50:00 Thats not socialism. Socialism is the government controlling the means of production: venezuela, the government controls all of the oil industry, food distribution, medical expenses. But I do want less government on those things because government is very inefficient.
3315 2018-07-04 18:49:54 I can think of a few ways to curb oil consumption way better than arbitrarily targeting a politically safe section of the supply chain.
3316 2018-07-04 18:49:52 Just show me the oil... 
3317 2018-07-04 18:49:48 Not a good situation sorry Ellie. Best advice I’ve heard about syringing is to use olive oil drops twice a day means the procedure is not harsh so it protects the eardrum a little. Take care
3318 2018-07-04 18:49:47 I'm never gonna not be me,
I'm just going to relate to people differently

3320 2018-07-04 18:49:39 I may not necessarily agree with it but I think it's fair to say you don't want to see heavy oil pipelines built and yet still consume oil. There's really no getting around not consuming it at the moment.

3322 2018-07-04 18:49:36 Yes, he called Bush & Obama stupid. He said, "I'd take the oil, that's what you do." It's equally appalling whether he's just ignorant or criminal or some combination therein, he's an abomination.

3335 2018-07-04 18:48:18 If Oil is going down, which company is the most traded and highly levered to the Oil price in your opinion? Exxon? Chevron? Other?

3337 2018-07-04 18:48:13 Serviced the car today all by my self, and it actually runs afterwards :D Changed oil, a bunch of filters and spark plugs. #XC70
3338 2018-07-04 18:48:02 Given how much ad agencies spend with the duopoly do you see more big companies making this move and in housing?  Post GDPR 1st party data is the new oil so companies that have it will want to keep control of it and make their own savings from it.
3339 2018-07-04 18:47:58 What is too risky? Shipping oil by rail along the Fraser, Thompson and Columbia Rivers and putting all those interior communities at risk? Shipping oil through foreign registered tankers to the Puget Sound and Anacortes and putting the Salish Sea at risk. Which risk is too high?
3340 2018-07-04 18:47:51 Come on johnetta crysta I need a fix u get me my fix, fix me up with some oil
3341 2018-07-04 18:47:51 He is no more than a carnival barker, snake oil salesman and thug, with all the same lack of decency 
and character, befitting same.
3342 2018-07-04 18:47:50 Y el fuel? Es la gasolina (gas oil) de toda la vida, no? No se gasta en la construccion de una central? :o y el cemento y el hormigón? Es lo mismo... No?

3344 2018-07-04 18:47:29 A mixture of ACV, witch hazel, & tea tree oil. Add a lil water if it’s to strong for you.
3345 2018-07-04 18:47:28 Was about to share getting burnt on Troon beach in 1976,, covered in coconut oil...then listened to the rest of the podcast...no words...keep on swearing...but you don't need my permission. I think I'll think about Bella tonight.
3346 2018-07-04 18:47:16 Dersh is going to own his millionaire friends by hanging out with the 'real' inhabitants of Marthas Vineyard, the indians, whalers, and those working with the whale oil and blubber.
3347 2018-07-04 18:47:05 I pestered them and pestered them.

They told me about furniture, blood diamonds, oil, old mob, russian mafia, MSM, elected officials, snowden, assange.
They showed me the world...

I can Never Thank them enough.   Never.
3348 2018-07-04 18:47:02 But honestly, what choice is there? We've designed our cities and structured our supply chains around oil consumption. I commute to work on a bicycle and just that one act gets me labelled a cultist by some members of #yyccc.
3349 2018-07-04 18:46:58 It’s not, he just has no comeback besides “oil” and “plastic”
3350 2018-07-04 18:46:47 there's so much oil under my dads semi and now all over me i'm feeling like one of them oil spill ducks from the dawn commercials
3351 2018-07-04 18:46:46 @JamaicanOil where can I buy Jamaican caster oil hairfood?
3352 2018-07-04 18:46:45 No sign of oil/water contamination there. Take my advise though Charlie, stick a bottle of Bars Leaks in the thing & save yourself a lot of pounds. It WON'T mess your cooling system up, it will just seal that little hole. Works a treat for pinprick leaks.
3353 2018-07-04 18:46:27 You need a hot oil treatment!  Tame those curls.
3354 2018-07-04 18:46:27 If you purchase baby oil and nothing else, an explanation always seems warranted.
3355 2018-07-04 18:46:25 She Look Like She Smell Like Sunflowers  And Coconut Oil 

3356 2018-07-04 18:46:18 Your definition of great is only determined by corporate money. In reality, women are losing rights, workers are losing rights, healthcare costs rising, prescription drug prices rising, oil rising, your crisis at border, a president we can't trust, relations with allies eroded...
3357 2018-07-04 18:46:15 So, after reading in detail I have a couple practical questions. The process from fruit to oil seems to change phenol makeup and lose phenol content. Any reasons why these results wouldn't be duplicated by just eating olives with other veggies?
3358 2018-07-04 18:46:11 That was my understanding - currently illegal in the U.K. due to the THC content. As you say, CBD oil with traces of THC is already widely available in the U.K. anyway
3359 2018-07-04 18:46:11 I accept that @realDonaldTrump is a successful criminal who conned his way into the oval office. But did we underestimate him, or are we overestimating the ability of the American people to recognize a snake oil salesman?
3360 2018-07-04 18:46:07 Loves I do need your prayer! My car with the small oil problem and then my upcoming exams! Thank you dearly
3361 2018-07-04 18:45:58 Hey! Not yet. Also very undecided on whether I should just go for the Rosehip luxe oil, which I've used and I know will work or try the brightening serum. Suggestions? I have sensitive and fussy skin
3362 2018-07-04 18:45:53 All you rappers at famu,fsu,tcc need to come up with a underground rap battle. That people can see your craft. An yall just go at each other however yall want.
3363 2018-07-04 18:45:42 You point to evidence that he said vile things. He did.
I'm looking for evidence that he has institued vile policies.
Child separation at the boarder is a policy that equals the outrage. It's also been ended.
What else, maybe an obscure of shore oil regulation?

Captured EPA staffer in UT, gasping from a 15-ft. chase, his tactical pants (Scottie's gift) in tatters. Gave him water from Uinta Basin. He had an email from Robbie [Bishop] OKing relaxed EPA regs for oil drilling in Basin. Notified HQ.  
Staffer died.  #secondcivilwarletter
3365 2018-07-04 18:45:28 Not imho. I expect Oil to soar into the triple digits starting in 2019 after the Fed and global CBs revert to QE on steroids. Saudis planning Aramco sale in 2019 and can always delay it again if necessary. Bigger issues going on than Aramco.

3367 2018-07-04 18:45:19 Imma bald head hoe too…edges weak AF and my hair is fine & thin. But emu oil has been working.

And making sure I dye my edges pure black so they are more visible.
3368 2018-07-04 18:45:18 : ah okay. Try nourishing them with olive oil and pinch of lime.
3369 2018-07-04 18:45:14 Yeah but the world is moving towards green energy. If Canada stops waking up and shift economy in 50 yers you will have a lots of oil and no customers.
3370 2018-07-04 18:45:13 Word u cant talk slick to a can of oil lol 
3371 2018-07-04 18:44:59 Na so I see am oo
3372 2018-07-04 18:44:59 Oh no... still hurting?  Japanese oil can do magic sometimes or a massage?
3373 2018-07-04 18:44:56 That is good to hear. I would welcome a change in their sponsorship from oil companies. It contradicts the ethics of environmental and scientific conservation of Earth and its life.
3374 2018-07-04 18:44:53 Trump Oil! He’s so useless, it would end up bankrupt!
3375 2018-07-04 18:44:52 "Fierce anti-communist". 

No he wasn't. Trotskyite. Invited into CIA as ally vrs Stalin; quickly took over. They're entrenched in media owned by CIA.
3376 2018-07-04 18:44:27 Dawson- “Yeah oil spills in the ocean & it kills fishes & then you have to wash ducks with soap.” wash ducks with soaps. wut.
3377 2018-07-04 18:44:15 where there is oil, the American government will also stick his nose.
3378 2018-07-04 18:44:08 So Trump is threatening to invade Venezuela. Now normally you wouldn't think a President would do that... They have no oil after all... heh... but this is Trump. And Trump is both stupid and insane. So I expect him to actually do it.

3380 2018-07-04 18:44:03 I usually also spray the table legs with the lavender oil and water mixture. The lavender oil is supposed to confuse the ants and it covers their scent trail. Hope it works for you too.

3382 2018-07-04 18:43:59 It doesn't matter who the oil is for. It will create Canadian jobs. And oil is cleaner than the coil you hate so much. You wouldn't even recognize your life without oil.

3386 2018-07-04 18:43:43 Climate change will drive migration. Wars will be fought for water instead of oil. It's here on our doorstep, knocking.

3391 2018-07-04 18:42:56 I am not saying you should stop eating the fried rice and other oily foods- just please check your oil intake!
3392 2018-07-04 18:42:31 Jack London drank himself to death, all while funding temperance causes to have alcohol banned. A little introspection would have been nice. Similarly, when even a Greenpeace activist is using oil everyday, it should warrant a more nuanced approach.
3393 2018-07-04 18:42:17 In a matter of an hour fuel prices went from 115.9 to 132.9 here in Winnipeg. Oil costs remain relatively the same. Can some please explain? Oh ya. Carbon tax effects testing. #endcarnbontax #TrudeauMustGo #TrudeauGrope
3394 2018-07-04 18:42:09 I'm also tired of blacks trying to force me to look black another reason why I want the oil, I'm not going to let them win
3395 2018-07-04 18:42:03 Yesterday after work we went on a mission for some smoke oil. Why not take a twin baron to a farm strip to grab 10 gallons of special extra white smoke oil. The 4th or July parade needs Brent Pahls to lay some smoke 
3396 2018-07-04 18:41:50 Oil field jobs vs bottle depot jobs, your right, they both pay the same.
3397 2018-07-04 18:41:47 CBD is not medical grade but hemp oil
3398 2018-07-04 18:41:39 I do enjoy the smell of Murphy's oil!
3399 2018-07-04 18:41:27 As he said about Iraq, "Why didn't we take the oil? We should have taken the oil." Not knowing or caring about international law or the Geneva Convention. He's a fucking moron. (This will be Rex Tillerson's legacy)

3402 2018-07-04 18:40:52 Yep I can't seeing doctors handing out perscriptions for weed in the uk unlike the States. CBD oil is very readily available in any health store already
3403 2018-07-04 18:40:48 Those Gulf nations burning valuable oil that could sell others just to make electricity is amazingly stupid considering how much cheap solar power is available to them.

3411 2018-07-04 18:40:12 Y'all day he wants better access to the oil...
Sorry,  that is not it. 
He needs another layer of distraction from his greedy corruption. 

Whatever he states as the reason,  30% of the population will believe it without question.

3421 2018-07-04 18:39:21 I’m certainly no expert although have followed he subject or a while - I would imagine that the biggest change in the U.K. would be that CBD oil would be allowed to have a THC content in excess of 0.2%?
3422 2018-07-04 18:39:16 I’ve been commuting like a bitch Philip told me he needs an oil change

3430 2018-07-04 18:38:29 None of the petro-chemical derived products would be possible if crude oil had not been transported to a refinery where it was then converted to the monomers used to produce the polymers that make up the materials they are wearing/using 2/
3431 2018-07-04 18:38:21 Are they kissing up for a piece of the oil pie?  That's my guess. They want to be oligarchs too. Why should Russia have all the fun and the best titles.

3442 2018-07-04 18:37:46 The one stool you speak of is something the current government inherited, which is the legacy of many Latin American counties, whether it be relying on a single crop for export or oil and mineral extraction. Diversifying the economy is an ongoing priority.
3443 2018-07-04 18:37:38 They have an upperhand in this let their issues be sorted first. In any case this oil will only benefit rich Turkanas  who dont live there.

3447 2018-07-04 18:37:02 Hehehehe these ones will soon agitating. E say “thank you for making us oil producing area”

3449 2018-07-04 18:36:43 It's the business model they use, it's old and out of date, but it keeps  the control with the good old boys. As I said earlier, it's like the  car co's acting like the oil co's are the customer, success based on how  much gas we buy, not how many cars they sell us. #SaveScorpion
3450 2018-07-04 18:36:42 STEP ONE : 

♡ Mix two tablespoons of castor oil and one tablespoon of coconut oil 
3451 2018-07-04 18:36:35 there was a standoff between some ranchers in Nevada against some random state run government land management agency. why does a land management agency have fucking snipers, helicopters, and armored SWAT vehicles??
3452 2018-07-04 18:36:25 America, where we reserve our fireworks to one day so that we can know what it's like in our oil producing territories everyday.
3453 2018-07-04 18:36:24 A lot of telecommunications, automotive, oil and gas expertise around Canada, too.
3454 2018-07-04 18:36:21 ... Oil products are in nearly everything, and the argument is we should be weening off of them, finding other means, more decomposable means, etc. Pointing out that protesters are using products that derive from oil is asinine for this purpose...

3458 2018-07-04 18:36:06 ... However, being that our world has been enveloped in oil products for 100+ years, being able to argue against it, or to fight to get off it, without using some of the products becomes nearly impossible to do...

3463 2018-07-04 18:35:47 The oil companies are well known for paying fringe scientists to come up with theories devoid of facts and detached from reality. Their creation of @EnergyInDepth is no different.
3464 2018-07-04 18:35:35 You seriously expect to persuade the giant pandas to mate with a box of laundry detergent, a waterlogged femidom and several dozen bottles of olive oil?
3465 2018-07-04 18:35:23 TH, this is going to blow your damn mind: protesters are changing the incentives for oil companies and government. And those are the bodies that make plastics and cars ubiquitous! So they’re doing exactly what you claim to want them to.
3466 2018-07-04 18:35:17 The article suggested a shot of olive oil or a handful of raw almonds. The idea is to clockwork orange brainwash your body into thinking that calories don’t taste good. no thanks! I’ll keep the extra pounds and have joy in my life.
3467 2018-07-04 18:35:11 He wants their oil.
3468 2018-07-04 18:35:07 U will get there faster when I take all yo oil!!!!!!!!
3469 2018-07-04 18:35:01 Bring them home; stop war for oil. Go to wind, solar, alternatives from our great land; get out of their country; STOP WARS!!!!
3470 2018-07-04 18:34:58 Grilled cheese = mature cheddar + chilli oil 
3471 2018-07-04 18:34:58 In regards to the oil...just yesterday Trump said we are going back to coal in the US. So WE will use coal...others get the oil. He's brilliant. A mastermind. Going out to change the oil..oops, coal in my car now.

3473 2018-07-04 18:34:52 Folk I know have been going home & away for 30/40 years but because of the oil down turn have lost there jobs but still manage to find funds to go to games, but would miss out so called big games due to lack of points

♡  For this method , you have to massage oil into your scalp while your upside down for 5 minutes daily to grow as much as 1” per week
3491 2018-07-04 18:32:43 i think my next tattoo will be really easy to sit for now that i know four part breathing & lavender oil.
3492 2018-07-04 18:32:28 UK debt - getting on for £2 trillion. LOL!!!!

What on earth is a Lord President? Have you been reading and believing the Daily Mail - the newspaper of choice of all unionist thickos.

Oil $78/barrel up from under $30.  Didn't you know?
3493 2018-07-04 18:32:21 And happy to you too!
3494 2018-07-04 18:32:20 So we can’t mock your leaders even if they are corrupt hustlers & snake oil salesmen who are going to rip you off once they use you to gain power & access to state resources?

3496 2018-07-04 18:32:11 That’s really not bad!  Oil painting is not the easiest.
3497 2018-07-04 18:32:00 Almond oil; look it up
3498 2018-07-04 18:32:00 Just a pinch of Olive oil and salt
3499 2018-07-04 18:31:58 Nope. It's lazy and amateurish to think that stopping the oil supply from one politically safe source will fix the problem — particularly when one is LITERALLY USING OIL every day.
3500 2018-07-04 18:31:56 California is in the middle of a drought. And your oil company buddies ignore this for their fracking interests. They use water in their operations and then that water destroys other water sources. Ignorance seems to be their MO here.
3501 2018-07-04 18:31:54 Chevron starts sale of several North Sea oil and gas fields....
3502 2018-07-04 18:31:52 I read from an animal rescue person that CBD oil helps tremendously.  Wish I knew sooner. Not to mention Vets like my brother with severe PTSD

3505 2018-07-04 18:31:23 William has been a farmer all his life I think, up Selling way. I think a lot of people will be attracted by the idea of solar (v. oil/coal/nuclear) for good reasons, but this project is so profoundly un-green and damaging I hope we can persuade them it ought to go to Kingsnorth!
3506 2018-07-04 18:31:16 I prefer this. 1 day delay of an oil tanker is very expensive. Sue the protesters and the Org. Involved. Money and jail time always seems to change people.
3507 2018-07-04 18:31:13 Definitely dives in hockey, but I think there is a fair amount of shaming that gets thrown back at the really bad actors by both fans and teammates. Doesn't seem to be the case with soccer.
3508 2018-07-04 18:31:10 So I want to remind everyone what we are fighting for –, but don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
3509 2018-07-04 18:30:55 Propserity bi-polar. Innovation+resources & Money-from-selling-only-resources, e.g oil. Latter economies purchase innovation fr prosperity, defense etc. When this change, i.e. innovation emerge as true human potential for resource dependent economies, Kashmir will Fe-out.
3510 2018-07-04 18:30:54 Having a car is not a sin, and buying things that don't contain plastic is basically impossible. You can work to reduce our dependence on oil while acknowledging that we'll still need SOME petroleum in the future.

Work to change the system from within the system, basically.
3511 2018-07-04 18:30:52 A typical problem in the African continent. If there is oil or mineral, there is always a group who wants to secede and use the resources by itself. If there is nothing, they remain with the country and share resources from other regions. These are Hayenas.
3512 2018-07-04 18:30:51 How do you trust large investors when your grandfathers inventions were stolen by a large investor in the big oil industry! He had two inventions that went world wide! I have six in the medical field! Legal NDAs only go so far!
3513 2018-07-04 18:30:47 They polled 1,020 people by random phone calls. This is misleading- it should read of 1,020 randomly polled-not 49% of American voters- snake oil - fear mongering- fake news CNN

3520 2018-07-04 18:30:06 Something I don't understand some states are still clamouring to get oil when the world is busy to render oil useless, the little arable land and useful they need to use to diversify their source income for future generations to come they want to soil it with blood and oil

3526 2018-07-04 18:29:34 thank you for your oil and IT
3527 2018-07-04 18:29:33 OMG! The most middle-class discussion @BBCRadio4 ever. Literally of interest only to those who went to Oxbridge. Just a whisker away from discussing first pressed olive oil and home made focaccia.
3528 2018-07-04 18:29:03 It's almost as if people using oil are responding to economic incentives, and that those incentives can be changed. But "oil companiez are evil" is far easier.
3529 2018-07-04 18:28:27 I soak mine in salt water for 30 minutes, dry them,drizzle with olive oil add garlic powder, sea salt, pepper, & onion powder bake for 30 minutes
3530 2018-07-04 18:28:27 sustainable from an oil perspective until we are advanced enough to move fully to electric power or whatever.  Surely it's more pollutive to import oil to the UK than to actually extract it from our own resources, and cheaper for the economy in the long run?  I respect the right

“Then I’m gonna help you every time one of my machines blows soot and oil on me!”

3540 2018-07-04 18:26:50 Iowa nodded, and took the can, inserting a straw to drink from it while keeping an eye on the meat on the grill. "Ahh... the scent of grilled pure American meat in the nose and the taste of a cold American oil drink down my throat. God bless America!"

3542 2018-07-04 18:26:34 Clearly @SenateMajLdr can't do anything that requires solving problems and helping America. He's just an old asshole that sells snake oil to suckers. I am so thankful that I don't live anywhere near that "son-of-a-bitch", to quote Mitch's president.

3545 2018-07-04 18:26:18 it's because he wants the oil that the crux of it
3546 2018-07-04 18:26:12 It's still a bit short I can't plait it.  I'm using the coconut and castor oil. Plus I'm spraying it with water.  Is that enough?
3547 2018-07-04 18:26:03 Yes. As a words it is a useful indicator of hype / snake oil in marketing slides.
3548 2018-07-04 18:25:59 So...I guess "Big Oil" should stop selling their dangerous and probably evil products in Rhode Island until this lawsuit is settled.
3549 2018-07-04 18:25:53 I love that their lives are literally depending on oil products , those flags made from oil too...#hypocrites.

3551 2018-07-04 18:25:35 Then you won't have a problem. The gasket will go if there is a severe drop in level with consequent overheating. Water in the oil or oil in the water will point to a failed gasket, as well as white smoke from the exhaust. Am sure yours is fine.
3552 2018-07-04 18:25:34 I’ve don’t be getting curved bc every Queen I’ve ever said anything to made it painfully obvious that she was tryna get snatched like oil moisturizer from a beauty supply store shelf 
3553 2018-07-04 18:25:33 You mean leakers like Trump. Trump burned an Israeli spy to the Russian Ambassador. Trump ended the Iran deal so that oil prices would go up to help save the Russian economy. Our president serves Russia. He is the ManWhorian Candidate.

3557 2018-07-04 18:25:12 No sir, i never said that they care about Venezuelan peoples. I just suggested a least destructive way to pump venezuelan oil into american barrel.
3558 2018-07-04 18:25:11 I can tell it's too warm because the jar of coconut oil in the kitchen hasn't been solid in a week
3559 2018-07-04 18:25:11 But also he had under command of Peres 1972 hostages in an Sabena aircraft in Los freed and was
wounded. Consider very few of Islamic countries have until now recognized Israel. They had had possibilities
to prepare with there oil trillions a good life for all Palestinians.
3560 2018-07-04 18:25:07 The illegitimate govt of @UKenyatta should treat security of turkana's as more important than the security of Oil. Soon  these people will be armed and pay back with violence. we all know how the oil story goes.

3562 2018-07-04 18:24:55 Putin needs oil/gas prices to climb. That is how he makes his $.
3563 2018-07-04 18:24:54 Why are you mad at me cuz you killed my body? Make it up to me by getting the oil, since you brought it up.
3564 2018-07-04 18:24:52 But, but, but I was told Chavez gave the oil to the people and gave them universal healthcare.

3568 2018-07-04 18:24:13 What things have you learned by looking up videos on YouTube? (cooking, changing your oil, redoing your floor boards etc.)
3569 2018-07-04 18:24:06 You have been watching too much MSM neoliberal propaganda. The government isn't in "tatters", their economy is struggling due to a) the collapse of oil prices (something outside their control) b) US economic warfare and political destabilization.
3570 2018-07-04 18:24:02 Poor servicing can lead to big repair bills. Clogged filters and poor oil have led to turbo failure. Luckily for this customer Vale Road Tyres was here to help. A new turbo and a full service should give trouble free motoring. Give us a shout to discuss your needs.

After Mexico take the province of Canada known as Alberta because of oil and while then convince Canada
3573 2018-07-04 18:23:48 I'm sure that the fact that there is oil there has nothing to do with it. <sarc>
3574 2018-07-04 18:23:46 Hey did you ever check out that CBD oil I was telling you about?
3575 2018-07-04 18:23:46 Oil prices in #Tanzania have gone above 1 US $ per litre as of 4th July, 2018. There is grave danger on cost of life going beyond the limits especially to the majority who are below the poverty line. #ChangeTanzania

3581 2018-07-04 18:22:24 Problem with the North American sport fan is they like their contact & many would argue that just calls made in soccer shouldn't be fouls. In all honesty, how many guys dive or act in hockey? It's rarely as obvious but it occurs regularly. People see what they want to see.
3582 2018-07-04 18:22:17 Somebody has already screwed the minds of Turkanas.Even the illiterate ones understand the oil exploration and the expected ammounts
3583 2018-07-04 18:22:17 Once my mom tossed a bottle of this new coconut oil lotion on my bed she wanted me to try. That was it. Didn't say anything about it at all... Ad for coconut oil popped up a little bit later on here... I almost threw my phone.

3586 2018-07-04 18:22:10 What specific part of the topic are you suggesting further investigation? That the source of the carbon element of plastic is oil?
3587 2018-07-04 18:22:03 Hehehe! Paying Taxes is like take a spoonful of Cod Liver Oil when we were kids!! By force of Arms (mother's) and threats of Hell-fire coming down!
3588 2018-07-04 18:21:59 Which conditioner ..for dry hair ..oil hair 
3589 2018-07-04 18:21:56 That’s a bit of a bold conclusion. I think the more likely result would be relying on much more foreign oil from South America and Middle East
3590 2018-07-04 18:21:51 I changed the oil in my differential & son that was tuffer than I expected 
3591 2018-07-04 18:21:38 I got sesame seed oil on face so now I smell delicious.

3595 2018-07-04 18:20:32 Why Venezuela (not Honduras for instance): Because Venezuela has oil.
3596 2018-07-04 18:20:12 Oh geeze. 
Protesters are people and they can't exist apart from the system they're trying to change.
If you want to see hypocrisy, watch someone drink clean water while calling for more oil pipelines.
3597 2018-07-04 18:20:04 US international policies are determined by oil. Americans demand abundant, affordable fuel. High prices, shortages at gas pumps can damage careers of US politicians. Wars fought to protect US oil interests in Mideast, etc.
3598 2018-07-04 18:20:02 It seems like an ideal candidate because they have oil and we could spin it as a humanitarian service
3599 2018-07-04 18:19:57 No concern that the Saudi's might try to "horse up" oil for the next 6 months in an effort to assure a successful Aramco IPO? Or would their efforts be akin to "spitting at a hurricane" given other, much stronger, economic forces?

On the one hand it is important to celebrate the foundation of a country

On the other, there's a pretty big elephant in the room and at the current moment its shaped like a barely functional oil pipeline
3604 2018-07-04 18:19:04 @realDonaldTrump ,

The corrupt fat liar drooling over all that oil.

Manchurian candidate receiving more orders on how to destroy America from within? Discussing lefting sanctions so Trump can profit from oil produced in Kara Sea?
3741 2018-07-04 18:03:13 Hey, guys? I can't find the #SecondCivilWar front. Did we move the day, or is Alex Jones just a lying sack of drama queen crap who's trying to incite violence while keeping his own snake-oil-selling hands clean?

3747 2018-07-04 18:02:01 There are claims all over, you know the same can be said of climate change and denial. This discussion requires facts and not speculation on the money. It can be said that your claim is paid for by big oil, this is nowhere. It’s specious and you know it.

Bowling Green is out of enemy hands, and the oil for the Tiki torches is in short supply due to the MAGATs boycotting Walmart because the store is selling Impeach45 t-shirts. 

Just kidding. I don’t really know because I’m in Paris celebrating from across the pond. 
3751 2018-07-04 18:01:31 Republicans with their addiction to oil, and their relationship with Russia and their fossil fuel resources are pretty much the definition of junkie whores.

3766 2018-07-04 17:59:33 Sorry I do not agree with you.  It is toxic and poison in my opinion.  Just stay in the sun for limited time periods.  When you start to get burned, get out of the sun, that simple.  And after,  slap on 100% ORGANIC coconut oil to replenish your skin.

3785 2018-07-04 17:56:53 He's certainly full of something. Bus prices go up because the price of oil is higher. Price of oil is higher because the value of the pound fell 20% against the dollar due to the leave vote. & guess who's lackluster campaigning & partial absence helped facilitate that outcome?
3786 2018-07-04 17:56:53 Does not need to go to America or Iran. This is happening in CANADA. We need to fight to protect what we have! Clean water, clean air, non poisoned fish and wildlife, gardens that can produce food. As a farmer you should know this. How well do things grow and live in oil?

3788 2018-07-04 17:56:13 There's lots of evidence. I'm telling you. In a test tube John's Hopkins found no antibiotic or combination of them could kill it. Oregano oil could. Shows it's antibiotic resistant. Again test tubes different than people, but it's intriguing
3789 2018-07-04 17:56:11 Thanks    It is quite extraordinary.    It’s looks even better now that there’s an oil coat to bring out the colour.
3790 2018-07-04 17:56:05 thought i saw there was a oil pen that does that. Not sure though
3791 2018-07-04 17:55:54 I walked into a VAPE shop to buy a vape pen(yes I know call me gay) and I walked out with a oil cartridge and 2 edible cookies.  Man I love South Carolina

Also It's bad a thing to boycott, even if the worse happens, boycotting will only be putting more oil into the fire.
3796 2018-07-04 17:55:08 Im a fruity drink type, i hate beer. I dont want nothing that tastes like motor oil or ammonia.
3797 2018-07-04 17:54:47 Notice it's not to stop dirty foreign oil from entering Canada? Don't you wonder why?
3798 2018-07-04 17:54:46 I am not playing with Christin and this coconut oil again on the beach. I still have tan lines from last year when she burnt me up
3799 2018-07-04 17:54:33 I know right and that's even when there's no bloody sauce in it!! You just pay extra for nothing but oil really annoys me haha
3800 2018-07-04 17:54:15 i burn badly because i’m so fair skinned but using oil for the 2 days i’ve been here it’s already going brown so i’m in for some luck hopefully! normally i use factor 15 but i burn like a bitch then stay white after anyway Xx

3803 2018-07-04 17:54:02 Industry is drawn by roce. EV's will mean huge layoffs in auto sector as will reduced private ownership. But both trends are unstoppable as consumers will be drawn to lower cost. 
Oh and I believe Auto sector is no more no less biased than oil and gas sector.

3805 2018-07-04 17:53:47 One thing that has helped is oregano oil. Costs 10 bucks a month off Amazon. John's Hopkins showed that it kills the bacteria better than any antibiotic in a test tube. They definitely said that. Does that sound like I'm being ripped off? My doc didn't tell me about it

3816 2018-07-04 17:51:54 No idea what 'enshrined in EU laws' means but I'm pretty sure that having oil or fishing waters isn't a pre-requisite for EU membership - but having your own currency is.  

The Growth Commission report says we'd adopt the Panama model - so did Indy white paper. Are they wrong?

3850 2018-07-04 17:48:51 July 4, 1853. Owners of a sawmill in Titusville, PA sign an oil lease with Jacob D Aigner, the first such lease in America and perhaps the world.
3851 2018-07-04 17:48:51 The government should expedite the oil business that has dragged for long now and that is the only way it can provide services to her people and relieved them from this tax burden with proper accountability and transparency in service delivery.

3872 2018-07-04 17:45:31 The Battle of Khaki Dockers just started here, we're waiting until they run out of citronella oil in their tiki torches before we sound the trumpets to charge.
3873 2018-07-04 17:45:23 Rubbing coconut oil on while the sun bakes me alive but I smell like a sexy little almond joy
3874 2018-07-04 17:45:15 @lagaless What are your thoughts on Turkana oil protests? Will it escalate to Boko Haram level?
3875 2018-07-04 17:45:15 Chestnut has a wide range of appearances and grades. If you like the natural color and figuring of the wood, sand and finish with tung oil - several coats - planning to re-apply once a year. Otherwise, an all-in-one stain/poly is simple to apply and gives you choices for color.
3876 2018-07-04 17:45:12 Breaking up trade with our allies. Supports nothing but the oil industry which is how Russia makes their money. Look at Pruitt Tillerson it all traces back to oil. Trump is pro Russia. #Resist

3882 2018-07-04 17:44:48 & put oil on the fire between the natural born warriors...it's not that simple as you say it...
3883 2018-07-04 17:44:40 Not starting a war....where there is equal footing....just go in and take it....more like talking of invading Venezuela....bc he wants their oil....no different when Iraq tried to invade Kuwiat...I don't think the Latino Nations will stand for that.
3884 2018-07-04 17:44:38 Giiirrrllll don’t you’re most likely going to hurt your natural lashes!!! Try using oil products and tweezers if you do though
3885 2018-07-04 17:44:34 @narendramodi 2 creations of God work very hard, are legendary, respected & helped humans 4 centuries. But have very different uses and r almost irreplaceable.
1. Horse
2. Donkey
Mr. Modi, how should a RULER be? 1 or 2? take ur pick.

u r so far #2 and will bite dust.

we need #1
3886 2018-07-04 17:44:34 We have done it in the past with Panama and today they are better than most latin American countries. Venezuela is a regional threat because they spread and finance communism with oil and drugs.
Venezuelans were always pro USA now we need to help them get rid of those narcos.
3887 2018-07-04 17:44:30 RK, re: Libya, Bush Admin had already negotiated their surrender in exchange for ending terrorism sponsorship & WMD programs, and evidence on AQ Khan nuclear proliferation. So why did Europeans fuck that up over an oil dispute?
3888 2018-07-04 17:44:29 A despertar de que? En que país viviste vos antes? Esto es asó ancestralmente, desde los 100 años de gobiernos colorados (y afines). Ah, y el gas oil productivo no subió, así que se quedaron con las ganas los de la 4 x 4
3889 2018-07-04 17:44:27 I just drizzled some oil on the veggies and grilled for a few minutes then tossed them in balsamic vinaigrette
3890 2018-07-04 17:44:16 Lol then surely you’re not blaming Zuma either cause I don’t see how he’d have more influence on the cost of living than Cyril since they’re in the same job and I’m pretty sure Zuma isn’t in charge of setting the price of oil? If we go on your initial tweet
3891 2018-07-04 17:44:04 Just spent 2 weeks in Europe listening to Europeans obsess over Trump while simultaneously pine for our lifestyle.
3892 2018-07-04 17:43:52 So you are just going to shout names - fair enough Les.  What do you want me to refute? Google will show that Scotland isn't Europe's biggest oil producer, it will also help you with the 2014 Indy White Paper and the Growth Commission Report - both say Panama model at indy.
3893 2018-07-04 17:43:38 I think his Nanny has just washed his mouth out with soap for swearing and he's had his daily dose of castor oil (keeps him nice and regular).

3898 2018-07-04 17:43:11 Canada is great country and is not stupid. Stupid is majority of citizens who voted for incompetent and corrupted government. And the result is clear- third biggest oil reserves in the world can't reach international markets.
3899 2018-07-04 17:43:10 EVERYTHING WE HAVE TAKEN FOR GRANTED IS NOW A CRAP SHOOT.  PROPLE IN POWER DE-REGULATE OUR WATER, FOOD, CLIMATE, DIRTY AIR, GMO FOOD, COAL MINES, PIPELINES 4 THE DIRTIEST CRUDE OIL NEAR WATER SOURCES.  TRUMP'S USA IS A DUMPSTER FIRE.

3901 2018-07-04 17:43:04 This fits perfectly with Trump's world view. Why not invade Valenzuela, take over, install your puppet, and then steal their oil to enrich the United States. The United States "wins". Trump thinks like and aspires to be a dictator. That is why he respects and admires Putin.
3902 2018-07-04 17:42:41 Sorry for late reply! We hand sand everything (no chemical strippers allowed) then oil and wax and polish, polish, polish. Tw students took about 3 days to do this.
3903 2018-07-04 17:42:34 Everyone knows this is an oil company pick to destroy regulations that were meant to protect US, the citizens! All those who think citing regulations are not on your and your childrens side!

3906 2018-07-04 17:42:30 @OilsandsAction Agree with you 100%. We should be producing our own oil and gas and sell it to Canadians at a decent price. Nova Scotia imports coal for power generation but can't mine and burn our own because of protestors.
3907 2018-07-04 17:42:19 I’m outta cooking grease and Olive oil y’all ever fried chicken with butter

3909 2018-07-04 17:42:12 Oh, I don't know that invading Venezuela would be pointless to TrumpCo -- just like Iraq, there's oil under that sand-- er, dirt.
3910 2018-07-04 17:42:10 Why don’t I see you protesting oil in Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, or any other terrorist countries? No you big bad men pick a country that you know you won’t get arrested in. Why not be in the water? Don’t want to be swimming in all that raw sewage dumped in? Why not protest that?
3911 2018-07-04 17:41:35 Looks delish change out the refined coconut oil for extra virgin when you run out. The refined oil has much less nutrition value. But if you aren’t big on the coconut flavor then stick with the refined. They process the flavor and aroma out of. Some people don’t like coconut.
3912 2018-07-04 17:41:34 Dear Piera since, I guess you could understand english, you should even agree that Cottarelli's translation is quite wrong, or at least, not so accurate, because there's a confluence of causes to explain the russian success in economy reform not only the price of energy (not oil)
3913 2018-07-04 17:41:31 You cant clean oil out of water.
3914 2018-07-04 17:41:03 He's an opportunist, says just enough to fool Trump supporters; I'm not buying his snake oil.
3915 2018-07-04 17:41:02 Thank you Mike, and all of the other amazing people with you blocking #tarsands oil tankers. The world is a better place because of you guys 
3916 2018-07-04 17:41:01 Could the unrest in schools in Nyanza be a factor that "oil " for exams has been curtailed... a response to delocalization. Underperforming students admitted 3/4 years ago thru 'backdoor' are now realising that its harder to pass exams with Matiangi/Magoha  rules in place??
3917 2018-07-04 17:41:01 Well, Panama doesn't - that's why we'd be adopting their model.

You don't actually know what you're talking about do you.  What you have are a load of assertions that u hope are true - and they aren't Les.

Scotland isn't the biggest oil producer, nor would we have a currency.

3925 2018-07-04 17:40:31 US wants oil from caribean maracaibo seas from venezuela  (mexico coasts already have it). There is a lot of reserves in there more than mid west zone.
3926 2018-07-04 17:40:31 u kno what i’ve heard other ppl use that (and baby oil) i’m defo gonna try it i feel like i’ve just scrubbed like 10 layers of skin off 
3927 2018-07-04 17:40:15 In theory, sure. I want smart, funny, creative, independent kids.

3930 2018-07-04 17:39:49 Glad to hear you are making more money now. Most are not. Oil and Gas is hurting with higher steel prices and tariffs, wild swings every week. Nobody can work this way, projects get canceled. Market highs do not mean shit for most people. Market highs fall.

3933 2018-07-04 17:39:32 This is my only known diagram for a cover up, the ten Senators in Russia are collaborating on a sale of Chevron oil fields to Russia
3934 2018-07-04 17:39:29 Is not lie Scott Pruitt using EPA get rich from it, protecting Lobbyists oil companies too. Face it, the pplTrump put in power, is the swamp. Lmao.
3935 2018-07-04 17:39:21 Venezuela was screwed before any sanctions. Socialism does not work. Especially when your economy is dependent on oil and only oil so stop spreading nonsense Trita! The mullahs must go. Iran's problems are because of the mullahs alone. Marg bar IRI.

3942 2018-07-04 17:38:23 ...Olay body shimmer lotion, almond oil on top of that (if I’m feeling really dry), Vaseline on the feet. That’s it. 

It’s a lot but my skin is extra soft.
3943 2018-07-04 17:38:22 Pick any of those and Tristan's argument falls apart. Eg: I support pipelines and oil extraction, but that doesn't mean I want one going through my house. Am I then a hypocrite for opposing the pipeline?
3944 2018-07-04 17:38:22 Sudelined, no way.  We control SWIFT. We can also easily shut down any exports to them & their oil.
3945 2018-07-04 17:38:20 Made thc olive oil w reclaim ln. Took 1 dropper full 9:40am. It hit w/in 30 minutes which is not typical for me. Usually 2 hours.

3947 2018-07-04 17:38:13 We don't need to buy any oil from Canada thank you.
And here in Nevada we don't need to buy any power either.
How do you love the tariffs on your dairy in the cars that bring from America to your country??

3948 2018-07-04 17:38:11 Bush jr was a non containment person. Dick Cheney was a containment person. That’s like oil and water. Hence scooter Libby was not pardoned. That was a incorrect match up.

3950 2018-07-04 17:38:07 My explanation is, Economic powers need Gas and oil etc, they just need tensions in middle east to gain more, and sell waepons etc. War just ends this cycle !!

3954 2018-07-04 17:37:30 So, apparently my Bicycle Chain needed oil..... Also, I might have made cops a little mad when I drove by them at Mach 2
3955 2018-07-04 17:37:18 It will also provide China with the oil they need for expansionist military operations. Our admin uses two dimensional thinking and doesn't see these new plans. They don't listen to experts like McMaster.

3958 2018-07-04 17:37:04 Seems like a rehash of his whining we didn't get the Iraqi oil...are these two countries affecting Russia badly on the oil issue?
3959 2018-07-04 17:37:04 socialism is growing because there's more and more people from central and south america here, who have been exposed to socialism, & have an intolerant culture of hate & resentment, & they are bringing that same mentality to America, together w/dislike for gays & blacks etc
3960 2018-07-04 17:36:46 If you want to pan fry them get some oil of your choice and just coat the bottom of the pan (I use avocado oil) season them heavy so the seasoning seared to the meat. Get your pan really hot toss them in for about 2 minutes on each side. Take the heat down flip them and cook

3964 2018-07-04 17:36:34 Protesting against increasing oil production is about pushing for change in how the government supports investment in renewable infrastructure while divesting in fossil fuel production. Don't be a knob in claiming otherwise.
3965 2018-07-04 17:36:21 The Kremlin also approved a major plan foor the far east to protect North Korea and supply China with oil to trigger China's war machine. In the Kremlin's thinking, building oil pipelines through North Korea will prevent Trump from attacking.
3966 2018-07-04 17:36:19 Correct. Museum at Livingston.  Shale oil
3967 2018-07-04 17:36:06 Should be fun to see play out.  Best move is to sit tight while Gulf attempts to fill an unfillable gap.  High oil prices then recession sit on the back side.  Rex made Trump miss his window on Iran sanctions, too late now.

3974 2018-07-04 17:35:09 1-2) Whether Iran will block the flow of oil export in the Middle East or not, depends on many factors and any analysis in this regard is beyond the scope of Twitter. But, if one asks me can Iran do that i say yes. Iran has the capability & power to disrupt oil & gas export
3975 2018-07-04 17:35:09 Boom and bust economy driven by relying on dirty tar sands oil 
3976 2018-07-04 17:35:06 The point is: Look at all the plastic around you and stop externalizing. Oil companies are serving a legitimate demand, but it's easier to rappel off a bridge than tell people to stop ordering shit from Amazon.

3979 2018-07-04 17:34:31 You want to be careful not to over cook them. If you are doing the oven cook them lower and slower and coat them with a little olive oil before you season them. Like 350 for 15 minutes unless you have like 5 lbs. Let them rest then cut one open to see if it is done.

3987 2018-07-04 17:33:56 Potatoes are technically the healthiest "super food" there is. So much so, that you could live off of them solely, and you would only be short on 2 vitamins. The oil that people fry french fries in is the fattening and artery-clogging aspect.

3989 2018-07-04 17:33:35 Sorry if you already answered. (I can't find it.) But did you incorporate the olive oil into your food/beverage...or apply it to your scalp/hair? 
3990 2018-07-04 17:33:22 I at least give him credit for choosing a country without much of a military and without nukes...guessing its because of the OIL???  As it is always about the money.  

If he did this, he would have forced those citzens into a subservient / slave set-up to work the oil fields etc
3991 2018-07-04 17:33:21 Don’t believe @CNN @MSNBC.OPEC just decided to increase production of oil, and Saudi Arabia just increased oil production to 2 million barrels a day. Pulling out of Iran not effecting oil prices, OPEC cut production to increase prices thru traders and speculation 6 months ago
3992 2018-07-04 17:33:10 Yeah, we really made out like bandits in WWI & II when we spent billions of $ and lost hundreds of thousands of lives to assist our allies and then helped the enemy rebuild their countries. And we got all that Korean and Vietnamese oil for our efforts to staunch communism, too.
3993 2018-07-04 17:33:03 Added macadamia oil to my skincare routine and UGH. It’s perfect 
3994 2018-07-04 17:32:56 A threat from Iran, “If Iran  is not allowed to export oil then Iran will not allow others in Mid East to export it either”. It simply means that the Strait of Hormuz is vulnerable.  Very vulnerable indeed.
3995 2018-07-04 17:32:44 Plus he wants to end the ban on gas & oil extraction on Great Lakes
3996 2018-07-04 17:32:21 That was a bad match up. Bush jr and dick Cheney. Bush jr was not a containment person. Cheney was. That’s like oil and water.
3997 2018-07-04 17:32:21 Oh yes. Because this turned out so well every other time we did it. Why don't we try not sanctioning them and helping them utilize their oil reserves. There's that word again coinciding with govts we don't like. Oil.
3998 2018-07-04 17:32:11 mOOD . i posted one of my digital drawing on facebook (one that took hours) and a lady said:
"It's gorgeous!! what did u use? oil paint or acrylics?"
me: i did it digitally !!
her: "oh ..i see :/"

LIKE???? sooo disrespectful . digital is harder than tradicional to me
3999 2018-07-04 17:32:03 Wait until someone explains to him that annexing the country to steal the oil also means getting 30 M funny brown looking new citizens.
4000 2018-07-04 17:31:59 Next lets get past the concept that Oil is some wonder material and economic gold. Its just one resource out of many. the US has lots and I mean lots of nautrual resources, from top quality farm land, to timber, wind, we started with an abundance of basically everything.
4001 2018-07-04 17:31:55 Do not shame her for speaking the truth.  Sanders speaks the truth to Trump lie about Oil Prices is sufficient. I don’t care how Trump “feels” about it, do you?
4002 2018-07-04 17:31:51 I was gonna get an oil change today and forgot it was the 4th so I guess I’m not leaving town tomorrow 
4003 2018-07-04 17:31:28 Lol I think I’m pretty soft but I’ll always accept tips. My routine is coconut hibiscus scrub in the shower followed by Shea butter and coconut oil spray
4004 2018-07-04 17:31:27 The miracle whip is laced with Trump oil if you eat it you won't see the evil that lurks around the White House.
4005 2018-07-04 17:31:22 He also said, why can't we just TAKE Iraq's oil? In other words, steal it. That's the kind of mentality that thought it was okay 2 steal a people fr their homeland & put them 2 work as slaves. The kind of man that solicits non-citizens 2 work at Mara-logo 2 avoid fair labor laws.
4006 2018-07-04 17:31:02 We are taking heavy punches from the volatile oil market Sir. We need an energy solution from within our boarders. You are the Havard guy so figure something out. Thank you.
4007 2018-07-04 17:30:57 @CNN  is reporting trump asked aides abt invading. Venezuela. Everything falling into place. EU, tariffs, NATO, dictator love.  Russian interference.  Is it oil?  @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan  Wake up before he invades Baltimore for the crabs  For Chrissake.
4008 2018-07-04 17:30:42 Now about this inaccuracy about Scotland being the biggest oil supplier in europe - you going to retract that or are you just going to keep shouting cretin at people and posting PMSL emojies like a boss?
4009 2018-07-04 17:30:39 I think I would enjoy it there too. 
You have to immerse yourself a little when you’re travelling. 
Seems like a lot of work for me at home when I’m running out the door in the morning to a rig to get covered in mud and oil. Lol

4013 2018-07-04 17:30:20 Saudi Arabia is the Place 9/11 started. Bush kept it covered up till the end of his term. We went to war with the wrong people for OIL and Revenge, it didn't matter to the USA Gov. it was the wrong place, we couldn't attack Saudi Arabia even though they were behind 9/11.
4014 2018-07-04 17:30:15 My car just told me I need an oil change. Cool

4018 2018-07-04 17:29:51 Thought it was the oil? Or is that the same thing? 
4019 2018-07-04 17:29:08 high in june 2008 was $147.50 and low was $32.40 dec 2008 during that time frame.
chart is inaccurate and deceiving - it shows higher highs and lower highs displayed across all time frames.  explanation please. #oott #oil #wti #nymex

4023 2018-07-04 17:28:52 1.Nobody said let everyone in
2. N korea, Africa and the middle east are starving its people too why didn't he invade there but Venezuela he wants an invasion. 
3. I thought Trump was against globalization so why is he interfering in a country that has nothing to do with us? Oil?
4024 2018-07-04 17:28:47 Trump wants to invade Venezuela but Russia has already invaded Vzla, only without bullets or troops, They  invaded with money to bribe Maduro in exchange for more control over the  OPEC nation's crude reserve, the largest in the world. REMEMBER THIS...  IT'S ALL ABOUT THE OIL!
4025 2018-07-04 17:28:26 Try the Eco Olive Oil one ! It’s really good
4026 2018-07-04 17:28:26 What do you want to bet this idea to invade Argentina came from Putin? There's a backstory with oil and loans.  Can't be sure, but Trump running around trying to get people to go along with this idea he doesn't fully grasp seems ripe to have been an idea planted by his "handler"
4027 2018-07-04 17:28:21 Seem to remember being given an oh-fish-oil shirt as a “gift” from @haplo1976 and threw it back. #NotFitToWashTheCar

4031 2018-07-04 17:28:08 Zucchini pizza. Olive oil on the zucchini and bake a couple minutes. Then put tomato sauce, mozzarella, and pepperoni and bake another 5 or so minutes until cheese is melty. Not the healthiest but healthier than pizza!

4035 2018-07-04 17:27:38 You can't fathom why large swathes of the country are repulsed by Trump like oil in water? It's not a complicated question to answer.

4044 2018-07-04 17:27:07 Castor oil is known for its repairing properties, try that out as a start. Also look into putting your hair into a low stress protective style (like large cornrows). But don't stop just there, look at your routine as a whole, what can you do better for your hair??
4045 2018-07-04 17:27:04 Na can't be true, all the unionists say their is no oil...  BP must be wrong.  You know the guys actually running the tests...
4046 2018-07-04 17:27:04 Well, which foreign oil...  we get most of our foreign oil from Canada, then Mexico.  The triumvirate economic banana split.
4047 2018-07-04 17:27:03 The deep state supporting Rothschilds are taking Venezuela down for their oil, minerals, to preserve the petrodollar, and to force centralized banking debt slavery on them. Think Libya.
4048 2018-07-04 17:26:43 Russia has already invaded Vzla, only without bullets or troops, They invaded with money to bribe Maduro in exchange for more control over the OPEC nation's crude reserve, the largest in the world. REMEMBER THIS... IT'S ALL ABOUT THE OIL
4049 2018-07-04 17:26:38 And what was the reason again they were there? It wasn't to promote freedom, it wasn't to advance a foreign policy, maybe it was too gain control of their oil. Another words, the soldiers were accessories in a crime of theft.

4057 2018-07-04 17:25:24 Are you suggesting the US doesn’t involve themselves? At all? Ever? Venezuela has 2nd largest oil reserve in the world. You don’t nationalize it without serious repercussion. It’s always $$ Now corporations in Venezuela are using economic warfare to make life unnecessarily shite
4058 2018-07-04 17:25:20 Of course you do Guy. Russia's defense budget $50 Billion - Nato over a $Trillion - and now we need a European defence "capability" that already exists under Nato - but we have to keep that fecking gravy train going killing & bombing brown folks with the oil and gas!

4065 2018-07-04 17:24:56 RK, Remember lend lease? Re: oil, US interest in guaranteeing free flow of oil in ME is an anti-colonial policy from post-WW2; we have plenty of oil ourselves. Yes, Obama violated that policy in Libya by facilitating European led regime change there w/ resulting chaos.

4095 2018-07-04 17:20:49 @MarkusGuerne Gerade angefangen Ihr Buch zu lesen. Auf Seite 14 schreiben Sie, dass der Preis der großen Öl Firmen stark vom Öl-Preis abhängt. Vergleicht man aber die monatlichen %-Änderungen des XOI und Crude Oil von Feb 1986 bis Jun 2018, so ist die Correlation nur 0.31.
4096 2018-07-04 17:20:41 Bio oil has worked well for me when I remember to use it regularly! I've never used it on a keloid (though I'm prone to those too), but it works for me for for dark marks, acne scars, and other inconsistencies in my skin tone

4138 2018-07-04 17:14:30 Best day for an oil change. I was next.
4139 2018-07-04 17:14:30 Venezuela isn't socialist. If anything, more socialism would solve their problems, which is caused by US backed private companies intentionally engineering a food shortage, in retaliation for Venezuela not giving their oil fields to the US.

4159 2018-07-04 17:11:54 stumbled across a video for “keto french toast sticks” which was essentially eggs, olive oil, and maple “flavor” and now I completely understand why they’re so angry all the time
4160 2018-07-04 17:11:53 It took yelling and buying the 2-cycle oil myself and putting the string on the thing myself but I finally got my husband out there weedeating the grass. 
4161 2018-07-04 17:11:49 WHERE DO I APPLY

4168 2018-07-04 17:11:20 He has decimated Alberta and the oil and gas industry. While Alberta was laying off 100,000 plus workers as oil price dropped, he continued to do nothing to assist. Bombardier (company in Quebec) built trains and planes with no buyers, he gave them $1billion

4186 2018-07-04 17:09:18 Aloe Vera isn’t so much a lie as the way it’s been watered down, not unlike juice. Just use straight lavender essential oil. You’ll cure burns overnight.
4187 2018-07-04 17:08:58 Middle management, CEOs, Oil workers etc.. They all are dominated by men. And they also have a lot of turnover and layoffs. So of course this is skewed. It’s really not relating to gender other than the fact that men typically work more of the higher paying jobs.
4188 2018-07-04 17:08:57 Broker has target of 31p, they hit oil then its anyones guess...
4189 2018-07-04 17:08:47 My own projections only went to the $70’s — I cannot speak for others. Now that crude oil $WTIC $CL hit the $70’s I’m focusing elsewhere; I personally think it’s at risk of turning much lower but not actively charting it for the time being.
4190 2018-07-04 17:08:43 He'll now go back to his job as a helicopter pilot who fights oil rig fires.
4191 2018-07-04 17:08:41 My brother is making me buy my own oil today and I'm actually freaking out about it bc I am a stereotypical woman and I don't know SHIT
4192 2018-07-04 17:08:40 Definitely! I love the face products! I’ve been using the youth oil as well and the Ethiopian honey mask!
4193 2018-07-04 17:08:37 Kejriwal is like castor oil. At the first encounter, he gives you terribly awful taste (Open dharna, apology, sitting dharna, extended sleepover dharna). Result takes a little time, one has to wait patiently. But the result does give relief, as it is all about "de-clogging" 
4194 2018-07-04 17:08:33 PS: we used the deep fry oil to fuel our cars!!
4195 2018-07-04 17:08:14 For dry skin, use a mixture of baby oil and epsom salt. Rub into skin then shower.
4196 2018-07-04 17:08:13 Its interesting that of the four nations with the largest oil reserves, two are allies of the US where US corporations do business (Canada & Saudi Arabia) while the other two are the sole focus of US efforts at "regime change"; Venezuela & Iran.
4197 2018-07-04 17:07:47 Not about human rights but about taking their oil
4198 2018-07-04 17:07:42 ...and no carbon taxes levied on 700,000 barrels of daily imported Saudi oil.....
4199 2018-07-04 17:07:41 They money hungry, just like most of the dems.
@Ocasio2018 is a good  dem socialist. Free tuition, free healthcare. Better  than Afghanistan war, still in Iraq, Somalia, Nigeria.$ 21T n debt. Research trumps stock shares, ie. oil, gas, bombs, planes...on & on.
4200 2018-07-04 17:07:38 Tell me, Emily: Just how long have Climate Cultists been warning of this 'Climate Crisis'? We are so overdue that my deceased grandmother remembers it. This isn't science. It's stupidity and snake oil. I suppose you could have done worse but this is such a stupid religion.
4201 2018-07-04 17:07:35 They have oil right
4202 2018-07-04 17:07:34 I have supergrowth oil. They need to spray their beard with water everyday like a plant. Im helping my dude grow his beard. As he see the length of my own hair so Im helping him out. He must also massage that area. Its a process but they can grow it
4203 2018-07-04 17:07:27 Actually my bad, if we disrupt their oil production it’ll drive up Global prices which is good for Putin’s economy, which is shaky because of sanctions
4204 2018-07-04 17:07:19 No, I meant Oil. America's exporting more oil than importing now.
4205 2018-07-04 17:07:11 China won’t fire sell them.  That’s the importance of what China, Russia, Iran doing, w CNY oil, gold, OBOR, AIIB, SCO, & even w/Russian weapons.  China will say “Bugger off - Chinese/Russian/Iranian goods will settle in phys gold valued at XXX bbls of oil/oz.”
4206 2018-07-04 17:07:10 @ProgressAlberta all it took was @jkenney to say @GreenpeaceCA , blockade (guess he didn't think it was a legitimate protest) and oil to blow up his twitter account.   Holy #dogwhistle !!!!
4207 2018-07-04 17:06:47 Shrinkage so clutch in the summer. When it's too hot to have hair falling down your face & back, throw in some water & oil & rock tf out that afro puff.

4210 2018-07-04 17:06:14 So its Yoruba that makes good Egusi soup?

My brother Egusi soup depends on method of preparation.
Some people like Egusi fried in that case do you support to use one gallon of oil in it? 

Their mention Igbo and Yoruba you swing to Calabar/Akwa Ibom makers of sumptuous meal
4211 2018-07-04 17:06:08 Maybe he should think about restoring democracy to the USA before invading other countries for their oil.
4212 2018-07-04 17:06:03 สรรพนามงี้กูใช้ได้คนเดียว คุณอย่ามาทำตาม
4213 2018-07-04 17:05:49 Not one person that is professionally paid to oppose the Alberta oil sands ever "accidentally " uses the term tar sands.
It's deliberately said to persuade the unknowing people to your false agenda.

4219 2018-07-04 17:05:00 Money for this grand refinery will come from where? The clear blue sky? Energy companies?

No serious energy money is going to BC as long as idiots who don't understand economics are in control. None. @bcndp and @BCGreens have screwed that up.

Sell oil; make $$; invest in green.
4220 2018-07-04 17:04:52 Sorry folks, but the risks of tankers and non-tank vessels are obviously not the same, as non-tank vessels are, by definition, not loaded with crude oil.
4221 2018-07-04 17:04:45 Dear god, he found the hidden oil beer barrels, Quick! To the bunkers before WWIII starts!
4222 2018-07-04 17:04:41 I'm allergic to tree nuts and grape seed oil is great for me in those areas where many would use almond oil. #Ilovegrapeseedoil
4223 2018-07-04 17:04:34 because more men work in the oil and gas industry, especially in higher positions, so when people are laid off or forced to take a lower wage, it obviously effects men more....? lol common sense no?
4224 2018-07-04 17:04:33 Great.
So we'll have a $1 trillion oil fund by the end of the decade. Just like Norway?

Or?
4225 2018-07-04 17:04:23 My Barry-Sullivan relatives emigrated from Ebbw Vale 130 years ago. Pure coal air. Matriarch had grown up with it, Honorah died of bronchial sickness New Year’s Day aged 51. 
Coal/oil/gas- killers.
4226 2018-07-04 17:04:21 Yam potridge. Let’s kuku merge the two. As long as there’s palm oil instead.
4227 2018-07-04 17:04:14 Nutella is full of Palm oil that is responsible for mass deforestation & utimatly kills wildlife & destroys human lives. It's also really bad for our health #sorrytobeapartypooper #notsorry

4229 2018-07-04 17:04:08 Choose WATER Not Oil @JustinTrudeau
4230 2018-07-04 17:04:08 Heard he made a big portion of his wealth form Oil and gas industry. Now he wants to  on the rest of us by trying to destroy that industry. What sorry ass.
4231 2018-07-04 17:04:07 This idea of invasion isn’t based on democracy, it’s based on the fact Venezuela has a lot of oil.
4232 2018-07-04 17:04:01 Even without any oil from Iran or Venezuela, there would still be a surplus. There still wouldn't be a shortage. No reason for higher prices. Fake oil commodity market.
4233 2018-07-04 17:03:49 Don't need Ireland. Too much work for probably not even enough oil. Plus, the US has way more oil at home
4234 2018-07-04 17:03:43 “YG doesn’t like Kim Gura” - Lee Seunghoon, oil on canvas.
4235 2018-07-04 17:03:41 Do not be so stupid usa took control of Irak and later they left, USA produces more than venezuela and by the way Cuba has the control of the Venezuelan oil
4236 2018-07-04 17:03:39 Gee, thanks. Now quit running your fracked oil pipelines through our beautiful boundary waters and states.
4237 2018-07-04 17:03:30 You’re so full of crap! How the hell do you think that bloated war for profit military is funded?Roads,schools? Tax subsidies for oil companies?You should fly the Russian flag today!POS TRAITOR&MAGA EATER.
4238 2018-07-04 17:03:26 He has always been trying to steal oil as he said about the Iraq war, that we should steal their oil. The man is such an unsavory character.

4240 2018-07-04 17:03:14 Try Palestinian olive oil. However, it may be a tad too moral for your taste ...
4241 2018-07-04 17:03:01 They found out later it wasn't a good bike because it left a trail of oil everywhere it went and the enemies would find out where they were by following it... :) Tongue in cheek....Norton's are notorious for leaking oil

4243 2018-07-04 17:02:28 I’ll even watch @IngrahamAngle starting today. My republican buddies need to start calling their reps in DC.
4244 2018-07-04 17:02:26 Uncivilized people will always have issues with others' opinion. Especially when Pastors or religious leaders table their opinions on burning national issues. Lets keep deceiving ourselves out of folly and ignorance that OIL (the North) and WATER (the South) can mix together.
4245 2018-07-04 17:02:19 Hate is a word best saved for people like Stalin/Hitler. You wonder why the Pres says stuff, it's comments like yours that drive it. Fake news is not waiting to get the truth but being first to report and not caring who it may effect. Spend 2 min checking, then report. That's all

4248 2018-07-04 17:02:03 That's vague. Everyone loves the oil. Doesn't mean that "We" will see any more of the benefits it brings as part of the EU.... As part of an Independent Scotland, 100% should they choose.

4258 2018-07-04 17:01:10 I don’t think so. But then I always only diffuse 2 drops of essential oil to about 1L of water.

4272 2018-07-04 17:00:17 not okay. The grown ups are idiots and horrible
4273 2018-07-04 17:00:07 Global threats comes because Africa has last 60% arable land in the world, high value minerals like coltan, oil, diamonds, gold, now buildind sand etc!
4274 2018-07-04 17:00:04 3. Tea Tree Oil
Tea tree oil is excellent for treating acne and pimples. It has antibacterial properties that help fight the bacteria that cause these skin problems.
4275 2018-07-04 17:00:00 Ur head get oil my dear
4276 2018-07-04 16:59:57 Perhaps he prefers the sight of offshore oil drilling?
4277 2018-07-04 16:59:51 "If another period of high oil prices is coming, [EU] should mitigate them by lowering taxes on energy."

Taxes should not be used to dampen price signals. If taxes are too high, they are too high at any price. e.g. in UK, tax on road fuel is too high, on domestic energy too low.
4278 2018-07-04 16:59:50 Iran's Rouhani: US Pres. Trump Has Not Thought About The ‘Consequences’ Of Cutting Iranian Oil Sales - Irna

Oh he thinking hard now
4279 2018-07-04 16:59:32 Massive government transfers of the people's future wealth to banks, oil, and construction companies definitely sounds better when we call them 'investments'
4280 2018-07-04 16:59:28 U need an oil cleanser, not a foam cleanser bcs like Cetaphil, they're both water based cleanser. 

Double cleansing method :
1) Use oil cleanser 
2) Followed by water based cleanser

Contoh oil cleanser :
- Biore Cleansing Oil
- Hada Labo Cleansing Oil
- Senka Perfect Watery Oil
4281 2018-07-04 16:59:26 Omg so I just dreamt I did a full blown oil painting and I don’t even know how I did it but I was adding paint to hide nails all over the edge because I apparently nailed the canvas and did a horrible job at it because they were all crooked. ಠ_ಠ

Why the hell would I do that?! 
4282 2018-07-04 16:59:24 Is that motor oil or something?
4283 2018-07-04 16:59:11 Water and oil don’t mix, so if the oil is on fire, it’s causes explosions . Y’all gotta learn these things so you don’t end up with eyebrows

4285 2018-07-04 16:58:35 I would honestly do a mix of alcohol and vinegar. Alcohol for bacteria and white vinegar to change the ph. Old doctor’s trick from when I was a kid. But oil will probably help too.
4286 2018-07-04 16:58:34 Could make the West less reliant on Saudi oil and so change politcal situation in Middle East.
4287 2018-07-04 16:58:24 hmm Venezuela has oil
4288 2018-07-04 16:58:20 Yah take action to put an end to oil and gas.
4289 2018-07-04 16:58:18 They are going to make plans to get the oil out of Syria. Then how to turn that oil money into a high rise in Moscow and how trump will launder the money into Real estate.
4290 2018-07-04 16:58:16 A nice chocolate woman... all basted in baby oil.... shining and glistening...looling like a sexy ass rotisserie chicken from wegmans!

4291 2018-07-04 16:58:00 1. Ice
Ice can be used to quickly reduce the redness, swelling and inflammation of pimples. It helps in improving blood circulation to the affected area, and in tightening the skin pores and removing dirt and oil accumulated on the skin. You can use ice cubes or crushed ice.
4292 2018-07-04 16:57:56 #day #from #hell #work #car #home first no oil in my car , then total fuck up of a day at work, then flying ants  all over my front door - in desperate need of a massage  and chocolate  and a hug

4294 2018-07-04 16:57:54 Just got in the oil field and already obsessed with this shit boy I’m finna work 24 hour days
4295 2018-07-04 16:57:53 Get a toothpick to mix it up and if you have a serum/face oil add a few drops of it in there so it’s not as dry
4296 2018-07-04 16:57:50 Im sure im referring to only recent wars. Not only oil but position. And lets not forget the men who died have nothing to do with the men who pull the strings. Have some respect for the people who sacrifice themselves so you lol twits can throw in your 2 cents whenever youd like.
4297 2018-07-04 16:57:42 ...because we can just go in and grab the oil, right?
4298 2018-07-04 16:57:41 اسال اللي سهل دخولها العاهرة ؟ لذلك لما نقول الوطن مخترق من خونة العرض والدين والوطن ؟!

4301 2018-07-04 16:57:29 I love the smell of coconut oil and gunpowder in the morning
4302 2018-07-04 16:57:25 Kyle used my tanning oil for the 1st time yesterday and I laugh just about every time I see how pink his stomach is then I feel bad 
4303 2018-07-04 16:57:23 1) dice potatoes and sweet potatoes if you have them
2) toss with olive oil, roast for 20-30min at 425F
3) put on a flour tortilla with whatever. black beans, salsa, sour cream/creme fraiche, cheese, hot sauce, avocado, pork, chicken, whatever.
4) eat.
4304 2018-07-04 16:57:06 climate change is bullshit? tell that to those suffering 100 degree heat today. the GOP's "solution" is to turn down thermostats and use more coal and oil. and the sheep follow.
4305 2018-07-04 16:56:51 So why are you using products made from oil byproducts to hang from?? Bit hypocritical don’t you think!! You’re protesting against the very products you are using IN your protest, and posting on social media FROM a product made using oil byproducts. You don’t have a f’ing clue!!
4306 2018-07-04 16:56:46 Staying at my parents while my new house gets move in ready
Please pray that I manage to avoid any ableist comments, insinuations that I dont want to get better, and "essential oil cures" while I'm here.
I love my parents to death but I'm on vacation & dont wanna deal w/that
4307 2018-07-04 16:56:32 I let this virgin olive oil stay on my hair overnight and I just shampooed it out and just.... wow...
4308 2018-07-04 16:56:30 Since people are out in the sun more if you have any hair color in or your hair is more porous than usual (like your cuticles are open and your hair feels course) a good way to protect and close the cuticles up is applying some oil to them. Coconut oil and olive oil is good
4309 2018-07-04 16:56:11 Quit believing the Tyee then. It’s a BS article that blames a traffic jam on the oil industry. Making shit up.
4310 2018-07-04 16:56:06 تم

4312 2018-07-04 16:55:50 You know you’ve hit that adult life when you trade in your tanning oil for sunscreen.
4313 2018-07-04 16:55:43 And now Magongwa has become like Water+Oil all of a sudden.

4314 2018-07-04 16:55:39 Organic honey facial masks, y'all. Organic honey, tumeric,  and brown sugar (to exfoliate) I like this mask because honey is anti-inflammatory, helps with acne, ISNT DRYING, tumeric powder helps even the skin and carrot seed oil y'all! Yes, get into it
4315 2018-07-04 16:55:29 Embrace the coconut oil and aviators
4316 2018-07-04 16:55:26 To be fair Suzanne, I’ve watched you over several years are your thicker than crude oil and tar combined, all that Shropshire air with manure in it?
4317 2018-07-04 16:55:22 My darling children, 
I've volunteered to help coordinate the local battle here while you're at camp. We've bought up all the Citronella oil. The Red Hats are crying their way back to their moms' basements. I'll pick you up Saturday. Taking a nap now. 
Love, Mom

4318 2018-07-04 16:55:08 That Islamic terrorism is responsible is not in dispute. The issue is rather (as quoted in the article) “American policy has created chaos, giving oil to the fire of Islamic terrorism”. I know Christians from Syria and Iraq, and they echo this sentiment.
4319 2018-07-04 16:55:00 The world uses oil
4320 2018-07-04 16:54:57 So thankful I don’t have to go to a shop and pay $40 to get my oil changed and be annoyed by people tryna sell shit bc my dad gets on the ground and changes mine for me in the front yard
4321 2018-07-04 16:54:47 Y’all really believe y’all are fighting “terrorism in the Middle East” but the US is the terrorist waging wars for oil. Rethink your patriotism to capitalism.
4322 2018-07-04 16:54:46 Picked a load of those from a garden along Richmond riverside once. Tried getting into them for a look and my god that oil/stain that comes out stayed on my hands for weeks!
4323 2018-07-04 16:54:39 I'd be on board so long as it means we no longer subsidize the dirty tarsands business to the tune of $20,000,000,000 - $30,000,000,000 / year. hell, 
@environnementca gets less than 1/20th of that, and that's for the entire country. the special interest groups are oil producers
4324 2018-07-04 16:54:39 Bio oil and coconut oil best combo for the face wow
4325 2018-07-04 16:54:14 Don't feel bad! Like 90 percent of people have stretch marks. But you can always use coconut oil or aloe vera to lighten them 
4326 2018-07-04 16:53:58 You can read the weather you can predict the price of heating oil. I think you asked me that because you think the final club that’s easiest to get into is the one where I’ll have the best chance.
4327 2018-07-04 16:53:52 I use Rosewater and Vitamin E Oil. My hair loves it I always felt that less was better.
4328 2018-07-04 16:53:51 Weaker pound boosts exports. But crude oil is bought in dollars. And that means stuff costs more. Also, we are a BLOODY SERVICE ECONOMY. 

#brickwall
4329 2018-07-04 16:53:44 Sweden is NOT doing so great...and the ONLY reason Norway can afford their brand of socialism is because of the government getting all that North Sea oil money.  And I thought the left just despised 'oil'...
4330 2018-07-04 16:53:42 You should use olive oil
4331 2018-07-04 16:53:17 Tea tree oil is my best friend

4335 2018-07-04 16:52:45 Drumph keeps OKLAHOMA OIL BOY around to be the face of "drilling of the coast".  Drumps' ultimate goal is to produce a glut of oil in the US to drive the price down to impact Iran.  Such a fool! They have plenty of customers.
4336 2018-07-04 16:52:44 Do you know that just 0.1% of the organics are converted to oil and gas while 99.9% of them are dispersed in sediment! 
4337 2018-07-04 16:52:38 /rlt/ ada yg tau face oil yg bagus buat fine lines? apalagi wrinkle under eye :(

4339 2018-07-04 16:52:27 I'd be curious to see on what basis he was released. He's literally caught *on video* red-handed... In any case, not great times for the #LNA's international credibility. #Derna's victory was shadowed by the #oil crescent & the blockade is bound to harm LNA's rep. #Libya
4340 2018-07-04 16:52:25 The old Obama excuse. Sorry he's been gone a long time. You made a statement that Trump's swift action (haha) got the Saudi King to release 2 mil barrels of oil in the last 4 days. Prove it.
4341 2018-07-04 16:52:21 Dark chocolate tastes like dirt and oil. You’re nasty lmfaoo.

4345 2018-07-04 16:52:12 We are free? The corrupt government has essentially enslaved us and has slowly taken away our Freedoms. Of the many things that I wish to mention I'll just say we are slaves to Oil companies and slaves to Land and Property taxes and laws. Our days of freedom are long gone...
4346 2018-07-04 16:52:03 Current status: relaxed, sore, coated in some weird oil, and hungry. Kinda like a newborn calf.
4347 2018-07-04 16:52:00 This reminds me of the tragic images of Bird wildlife in 1978 during the oil disaster Esso Bernicia in the Scottish Shetlands- where my dad was involved with the clean up operation- the damage to Sea life was bad enough then!
4348 2018-07-04 16:51:53 Norway has a reserve of over a trillion dollars from its sales of North Sea oil. Can you just imagine the revenues our massive oil reserves could generate if obstructionist governments got out of the way? This country could probably be debt free in a generation
4349 2018-07-04 16:51:24 Putin wants the oil. Trump is just helping him get it.
4350 2018-07-04 16:51:18 If you bring your car in to get an oil change on July the 4th, your Mom’s a hoe
4351 2018-07-04 16:51:16 Yes and now sadly owned by an OIL COMPANY. EV drivers avoid at all cost, because the cost will be going through the roof.
4352 2018-07-04 16:51:11 Try Australian olive oil it’s fantastic!
4353 2018-07-04 16:51:03 Yam is yam and it can be porridged or pottaged , just make sure you use palm oil and all the other eroja

4355 2018-07-04 16:50:24 I've worked at the top of oil companies&at the bottom w/the homeless; watched&helped my dad start multiple businesses. I moved across the world to SE Asia take jobs at 18. I've seen the system from top to bottom,seen the injustices & it pushed me from right to left.
4356 2018-07-04 16:49:53 *Helping them slide*
Dad- I got that damn cooking oil all over my feet.
Mom- Better than dog shit.
Dad- I don't know. All about the same, I think.
4357 2018-07-04 16:49:51 Yes, Saudi is richer. But this is not a reason for turkey to get the Oil from ISIS and killed innocent people “the Kurds”. If Saudi is richer, this is because they are more developed and they are smart not to support terrorists. You are stupid because you believe Aljazirah.
4358 2018-07-04 16:49:40 But Venezuela = oil.
4359 2018-07-04 16:49:38 Yar.
4360 2018-07-04 16:49:36 We have oil wipes for that, we’ll be fine. 
4361 2018-07-04 16:49:34 I doubt it she is thicker than mince tar and crude oil combined
4362 2018-07-04 16:49:24 Wait, so why are the pharma firms allowed to use the tech and not power companies. If a by-product of mining is Thorium, why wouldn't we just use that instead of oil, gas. What about the million+ pop cities that by necessity consume vast amounts of energy. Where's the energy?
4363 2018-07-04 16:49:11 <みなさんにとっての"オイル"とは何ですか⁇
4364 2018-07-04 16:49:08 First everyone working there should stop using anything that big oil is in ... good luck...
4365 2018-07-04 16:48:59 Madura made Venezuela impossible for people. 

1st-no toilet paper
2nd-no luxury food
3rd-no corn flour for arepas.
4th-Rotating blackouts
5th-no medicine

The only thing left is oil Russia tried to buy out Citgo.

If we take over that country it's for the oil. How many died?
4366 2018-07-04 16:48:55 Oil field always eats great!
4367 2018-07-04 16:48:46 Then we can take their oil like he said we should have done with Iraq

4369 2018-07-04 16:48:45 All of this, all of it, Trump, Russia, Pruitt, Team Treason, Saudi Arabia, Yeman, Erik Prince, Sechelles; it's all about oil and pipelines.  Thanks, Team Treason.  You'll sell us all out for a dying industry instead of investing in the future.
4370 2018-07-04 16:48:43 Honestly cannot stand ppl who refuse to acknowledge that CBD oil is SOOOO beneficial for so many. Y’all suck booty

4374 2018-07-04 16:48:13 Lol... don’t worry dear, I just poured lubricant, oh, sorry oil... I think you should try again now
4375 2018-07-04 16:47:50 We're living in an age of extinction, and people love showing off how it's a trophy to parade what they Murder. At this point the oil companies should too. Humanity needs to be honest with itself. Instead it eats fast food and gets drunk, and will cause its own extinction.

4377 2018-07-04 16:47:13 Then reflect on American life 50 years ago:  political assassinations, Vietnam War, on the verge of stagflation and oil crisis, rampant race/sex discrimination, Watergate to come, etc.  That Trump says unpleasant things and society is coarser is nothing compared to them.
4378 2018-07-04 16:47:13 Even if you want to give her credit for the effort. There're things that needed an answer 
1 - The amount of oil she consumes and plastic of bottles. It's too much carbon print. 
2 - Usually, water is preserved in the reservoirs.
3 - How could one be that stupid?
4379 2018-07-04 16:47:10 Changing my oil at noon on a day like this was not a great idea…
4380 2018-07-04 16:46:52 Fresh oil @dianaahamilton on repeat

4385 2018-07-04 16:46:10 In high school I would tan nearly every day during the summer and slather myself in tanning oil. Now I feel like I’m living life on the edge if I even go outside without sunscreen. Is this #adulthood ?
4386 2018-07-04 16:46:09 Oil
4387 2018-07-04 16:45:55 The people will celebrate us for their liberation and their oil will pay for the military expenses. Right?
4388 2018-07-04 16:45:48 The liberals have absolutely no clue that just about EVERYTHING they use is a byproduct of oil in some way. #cluelessmorons
4389 2018-07-04 16:45:46 I would still like to know how much money Scottish oil made from when the first started pumping and where the fuk the money went not interested in Norway or any other old bollocks
4390 2018-07-04 16:45:33 あの場面、カードもらってでも潰しに行こうと前に出ればパス出されるだけ。ファールして相手選手転ばせたところで試合は止まらない、そのままプレーオンです。強いて批判するならばパスコースを切れていなかったこと。でもあの場面でそれを把握するのは不可能です。勉強しよう。

4393 2018-07-04 16:45:17 But .... they have oil!!!
4394 2018-07-04 16:45:06 Exactly. It’s time we “liberate” an oil rich country on this side of the pond....We definitely wouldn’t want to help out one of those Central American countries full of evil people seeking asylum in the US because they have a simple desire to live.
4395 2018-07-04 16:45:04 Painitin mo muna yung oil ha
4396 2018-07-04 16:45:02 Trying to decide between reading a book, or finishing laundry and changing the oil in my car....
4397 2018-07-04 16:45:00 He seemed nice when I first met him, but last time he showed up he tried unsuccessfully to make me feel small, I let it go but then as we continued to converse he started talking about women who pop out babies for extra welfare money (nothing about oil barons). Misogyny + racism1
4398 2018-07-04 16:44:41 Thanks. :)
Just turned on my calming oil diffuser. Should help!
4399 2018-07-04 16:44:36 I forgotten they have oil!
4400 2018-07-04 16:44:23 Exactly until governments change in this country next year it’s not a wise investment. As such the exodus from Canada’s oil sector since the Liberals and NDP took office is evident.
4401 2018-07-04 16:44:16 I  hemp cbd oil Awesome.
4402 2018-07-04 16:44:09 Perhaps US oil companies are crooks looking out for themselves. Perhaps they're related to Hump and share in his idiocy. Either way, we're screwed.
4403 2018-07-04 16:44:05 Record heat waves across the planet. Climate change in full swing and now you want to increase oil production for your pipeline!! Shame shame on you....
4404 2018-07-04 16:43:55 God bless the first person who put chicken wings in frying oil
4405 2018-07-04 16:43:48 A foul, detestable conflagration amongst countrymen. The specter of avocado famine emerges. And our coconut oil flows rancid. I fear nigh drought, the very mint-flavored vape we breathe. Yours of love and always, Lt. Matine F., they/them, 4th July, 2018. #secondcivilwarletter
4406 2018-07-04 16:43:42 I have thick hair. It is long (down to my booty) and dry (argan oil I love) I need a metric fuck ton of conditioner everytime I wash it and have not got on with solid shampoos I have tried before. 
Your products need to be vegan friendly and cruelty free before I can try too.

Their minimum wage is fair too? 

Am sure you're working in Oil Company
4410 2018-07-04 16:43:15 & they are building a pipeline from US to YVR for jet fuel. No protest when oil/fuel comes from US thru FraserRiver
4411 2018-07-04 16:43:13 War is to the 21st century what oil was to the 20th; the pillar that supports the global economy.
4412 2018-07-04 16:43:09 I’ve been outside all morning covered in coconut oil trying to roast in the sun. As a result I am 0.083% more tan. 

@MrCaban goes outside for 30 minutes covered in 100 SPF and is 9663829% darker
4413 2018-07-04 16:43:05 Norway and Russia are both part of Europe and produce lots more oil than Scotland.  

Poland doesn't formally use the EURO (although it will), but that's irrelevant.  The problem isn't 'what currency shall Scotland use on entering EU' - the problem is not having a currency.
4414 2018-07-04 16:43:01 I think it’s an important point in British culture, all of the frustrations of the post war era (Age of austerity, Suez crisis, The Troubles, oil crisis, high inflation) came out in a big fuck you in a way that hadn’t really been seen in modern times.
4415 2018-07-04 16:43:00 Not too sure I understand why oil should be trucked anywhere? Trucking burns tons of fuel; ruins highways and is stupid expensive compared to a pipeline. #SimpleMath if you review industry balance sheets. What am I missing?
4416 2018-07-04 16:42:59 How has Meesha made Pak a toxic place for women and the poor? Do you have an argument? Explain.

4419 2018-07-04 16:42:52 Because why exactly?  Oh oh, to steal their oil. Isn’t that his go to reason for such nonsense?

4421 2018-07-04 16:42:29 @ReginaDulanjali I doubt how true this analysis is, Indians without gold, is as true as “US Govt” without Oil.
4422 2018-07-04 16:42:23 I hope this CBD oil helps with the crippling, but weirdly empty pain constantly in my heart.

4424 2018-07-04 16:42:14 What would be the point of invading? Oil? Beachfront properly? His motivation certainly wasn't humanitarian! (His malignant narcissism disallows empathy toward others.)
4425 2018-07-04 16:42:09 Nuevamente tenemos un ajuste en los combustibles,  que impactaran en los costos y por ende, en la competitividad. Mas allá de que se mantuvo precio al gasoil, se debería de haber tomado igual tratamiento para el fuel Oil, combustible base de muchos sectores industriales.
4426 2018-07-04 16:42:05 #SecondCivilWarLetters Dearest life partner, Quinoa rations are low and our Whole Food supplies can’t get through the blockade. Our combat Birkenstocks are falling apart and our healer is running out of hemp oil for our blistered feet. Only my faith in Gaia is keeping me strong.
4427 2018-07-04 16:42:03 Do you sell snake oil?
4428 2018-07-04 16:42:03 Marginal gains - if you choose to believe that marketing nonsense then that’s up to you. No doubt you are down at Holland and Barratt at the moment stocking up on cannabis oil, seaweed extract and some keratin shampoo.

4430 2018-07-04 16:41:49 Someone categorized a bunch of fluid acrylic paints under “oil paint” in the POS and it made me have to go lay down on the floor for a couple minutes

4432 2018-07-04 16:41:38 Good. Now, kill each other and we'll come get the oil afterwards
4433 2018-07-04 16:41:30 Yeah but they have oil
4434 2018-07-04 16:41:30 Traffic jam is caused by the oil industry. Good luck with that one.

4438 2018-07-04 16:41:22 He’s after their oil. Russia owns the other half of their supply..
4439 2018-07-04 16:41:15 I get it twice a year usually while gardening or weed whacking. The last time I got it I thought it was a chemical burn because my face felt like it was on fire. Turns out the sweat band from my hat was causing a reaction with the oil. No bueno.
4440 2018-07-04 16:41:15 He wants to steal their oil.

4445 2018-07-04 16:40:44 Phew! Good job it’s you extolling the virtues of posh olive oil & not one of the millions of ordinary & diverse anti-Brexiters. If it was other way round you’d be pouring scorn on them for being elitist and out of touch with ordinary folk.

4465 2018-07-04 16:38:41 I wouldn't even chalk this one up to stupidity, but to his extreme level of BS. He wants there to be a national security justification for coal, so he comes up with a threat to oil. He doesn't bother to think if it holds up, because he's just BSing, not making a rational argument
4466 2018-07-04 16:38:35 All the working conditions in Norway are set under Norwegian law

shoot, even the Keystone pipeline does not help us with oil supplies (since it's more expensive tar sand that then gets exported oversees)

4484 2018-07-04 16:36:25 If it’s yellow puss, it’s probably poison ivy, sumac or oak. Have your doctor do a skin graft if you have health insurance coverage. They may have a steroid that can help it.

The issue with that family of ailment is it’s not a virus, it’s an oil. Once the oil is gone it’s gone.
4485 2018-07-04 16:36:24 David, like there is oil under the reflection pool at the Mall. Come on, that would just be foolish to drill there. Only drill where guaranteed profits are certain. Preferably National Parks and Wildlife Reserves.

4488 2018-07-04 16:36:12 Decade old story that predicted peak oil in 2011 is irrelevant. On the contrary, I would argue that supply will never be the problem. With stored solar approaching a BoE equivalent of $25-$30/bbl & cost of EV's declining rapidly, Oil's home market, transport, is being disrupted.

Aggressive, macho language being used pertaining to some poster's alleged trading skills.  Some epithets and expletives are hurled.

4506 2018-07-04 16:34:01 It's really easy to make. Only a couple of ingredients. Smoking the eggplant first is just another layer of flavor - but most people just rub them in oil and roast then in an oven. That's ok too.

4518 2018-07-04 16:33:07 Actually many say bad oil, should be banned, let’s sabotage things.  Greenpeace blockading tankers isn’t to push green energy, lets be honest! I am all for sustainable energy but why not put efforts into more sustainable energy that can be implemented Now instead of all the bs?
4519 2018-07-04 16:33:05 AMLO has also suggested he would curtail or even end crude oil exports, diverting supplies for domestic refining. Mexico’s aging refineries are operating way below capacity, and Mexico has become increasingly dependent on imported fuel from the United States.

4521 2018-07-04 16:32:34 I think we had so many opportunities to become energy independant in  some years and we blew it big time. As I live in the U.S. also part of the time I am thrilled with the flow of oil and all of the jobs it has created and by the way the U.S. has some of the lowest emissions.1/2
4522 2018-07-04 16:32:23 Syria and Yemen have no oil. The happenings in Syria is pretty much Russia trying to hold on to it's last middle eastern base and Yemen can be blamed on a continuation of Saudi vs Iran cold war. They're both oil rich. It's a clash between ideology in Yemen.
4523 2018-07-04 16:32:19 AMLO = a nationalistic outlook on energy, and spent years criticizing the liberalization of Mexico’s energy reform. He said that he would halt future auctions of Mexico’s offshore oil and gas reserves, whilepromising to investigate already-awarded contracts for cases of fraud.

4526 2018-07-04 16:31:35 It would be even weirder if they rolled up in a Flintstones car wearing all cotton. Just because society fully embraced oil products since the 50’s doesn’t mean we shouldn’t protest a foreign company exploiting our environment for profit and selling it to foreign countries.
4527 2018-07-04 16:31:27 Modi's so-called muscularity just got exposed actually and rather harshly. It's now more like a vassal agreeing to pay tribute to the emperor in oil. Rest of his foreign policy forays no better.Chahbahar also off limits now.
4528 2018-07-04 16:31:26 Do you mean a barrel (of oil) of laughs?
4529 2018-07-04 16:31:15 A&d is super bad for baby rash at that point even just reg baby but cream would be better then that but coconut oil is the way to go
4530 2018-07-04 16:30:52 Oh that’s a really good call.  I think I still have a dozen or so barrels of balsamic in the basement from the war on Christmas.  May have to run to Whole Foods for olive oil though.  That’s ok, I know Jeff Bezos needs the money.
4531 2018-07-04 16:30:44 I'm pretty slack about teh tweeter these days.  Anything involving olive oil turns out to be a mess.  #soihear
4532 2018-07-04 16:30:40 Spent all night watching @bonappetit cooking videos on YouTube, and now the only pre-roll ads I get are the same two about olive oil and prohibition
4533 2018-07-04 16:30:38 We use over 14,000 barrels of oil per day for air travel. The problem isn't finding non-polluting sources of fuel.  The problem is producing 230 million gallons of fuel per day just for aviation. The Earth had millions of years to accomplish this task.

4541 2018-07-04 16:29:39 Now i understand why God took wisdom n understanding away from the Ostrich (Job 39, verses 16 - 20).

Am sure it's for similar reason God in His Wisdom, didn't give the Fulani crude oil... Just imagine what would have happened to the rest of Nigeria if the crude was in the north!
4542 2018-07-04 16:29:38 An interesting idea, that of Elon Musk being a technological Red Adair, going from one science-based emergency to the next the way Adair used to put out oil well fires. It would probably be a criminal misuse of Musk's skills...but I know I'd watch.
4543 2018-07-04 16:29:34 Thank God for the freedom to change elected officials...  especially the two faced snake oil peddlers.
4544 2018-07-04 16:29:20 As a Senior Toxicologist for Shell Oil, I'm sure you have some relevant education and experience, but I doubt mapping and modeling watersheds is in your wheelhouse. And in light of who you work for, one might reasonably question your objectivity on the subject of EPA "overreach."
4545 2018-07-04 16:29:14 Mexico has no room to talk, its infested with drug cartels and gangs. We keep their economy a float, more so than their biggest export, oil. Mexico is out for Mexico and not the US.

4548 2018-07-04 16:29:06 The Disciples were jealous of Mary Magdalene because of her closeness to Jesus and her part in spreading the gospel! She was the one who prepared him for his burial with oil and She was the one who went to the tomb first and found that he had risen. She wrote a book also!

4566 2018-07-04 16:27:21 Trump doesn’t even care about Americans. What makes you think he cares about people form Venezuela. He’d take the oil, and leave the people to rot in misery. He would probably try to pile on their misery while he’s there.

4573 2018-07-04 16:26:45 I don’t care about media or specifically pushing Trump agenda.  I care about Flint drinking water, all our drinking water, unabated fracking, outta control oil wells, underground poorly inspected pipelines. What’s left for our grandchildren?
4574 2018-07-04 16:26:27 Look, GDP is simply a measure of economic activity, doesn't mean it's a good thing. While oil and Gas production dropped during the ft. Mac fire, Alberta's  GDP actually rose. Money was spent, people got paid. Mabey we need more disasters to fuel our economy?
4575 2018-07-04 16:26:21 Local stan talking about smart LMFAO!!!
4576 2018-07-04 16:26:19 Essentially we need a company to hit oil!!!
4577 2018-07-04 16:26:13 Anyway, back to this sugar debacle. Stop putting sugar in everything...that’s the main cause of underlying health issues. It’s not fat, oil, etc...it’s sugar.
4578 2018-07-04 16:26:06 Ight so boom. I got some pancake mix. On the back of the box it said use milk, eggs, and oil. I ran super low on milk, so I just used what I had left. I didn’t put that much mix in it. I mean, I ate it so we good
4579 2018-07-04 16:26:05 I think we should have taken enough oil to pay ourselves back.  But that aside, why stop at those 3 countries.  Why not include Libya/Syria/all of Europe / Asia and a good chunk of Africa?

4584 2018-07-04 16:25:52 Must have forgotten that Trump “signed a deal” with Saudi Arabia to increase oil production by 2 million barrels. I am sure that will be great for CP & not for Russia.

4603 2018-07-04 16:25:00 I tried with some 5w-30 oil I had on hand but I didn't let it sit a day. It didn't seem to light well with that. What kinda oil do I need?
4604 2018-07-04 16:24:57 It is just the location #CTBTO provided as its estimate of the center of the implosion. It has been thoroughly searched. Half of an oil barrel used for fishing vessel “cookouts” was found, but nothing larger. #CTBTO estimates are just crude triangulations from great distances.

4607 2018-07-04 16:23:47 Is the #SecondCivilWar being fought over oil? Are we being tricked again?
4608 2018-07-04 16:23:44 Yup. I never change my oil unless the car 'asks me' to which is maximum twice a year.
4609 2018-07-04 16:23:41 The geopolitics and supply ethics of EV and renewables is sooo fuckin' terrible.  Even when compared to oil and gas.

4611 2018-07-04 16:23:36 Probably because the oil is of inferior quality?
4612 2018-07-04 16:23:08 Now, can we expect US to be delivering oil or importing goods-services. Neither affordable for for Trump's America.

4624 2018-07-04 16:22:20 GDP in Libya is expected to expand 55 percent in 2017 from the previous year due to recovery in oil production. GDP Annual Growth Rate averaged 4.95 percent from 2000 until 2017, reaching an all time high of 104.37 percent in 2012 and a record low of -62.10 percent in 2011.

4638 2018-07-04 16:20:44 If they had even the most rudimentary understanding of economics, they would see that they are actually accelerating demand. The longer Alberta's oil stays in the ground, the more valuable it will become. Nothing more than a short-sighted deferral

4646 2018-07-04 16:20:20 Normally, we use the pretext of an invasion to prop up a regime that allows corporations easier access to resources. (Iraq, Haiti, Nicaragua). However, Candidate Trump often lamented that we didn't "take the oil" from Iraq.

4663 2018-07-04 16:18:39 These protests are funded by foreign interests and they target Canadian oil only. That does not concern you. We have dictator oil coming into Eastern Canada daily. Comment on that please.
4664 2018-07-04 16:18:36 He wants the oil
4665 2018-07-04 16:18:33 Step 1: get a tarp 
Step 2: get vegetable oil 
Step 3: die
4666 2018-07-04 16:18:25 All anyone remembers is cheap oil/energy.

4669 2018-07-04 16:17:56 I’ve just tried baby oil? Didn’t even work..
4670 2018-07-04 16:17:53 i do. i just never could do mayo.
but i use yogurt for sweet, fruity dressings. they're my favorite :)
i use olive oil for others, like ceasars where you incorporate raw egg.
and lemon in everything lol
what's your fave dressing??
4671 2018-07-04 16:17:43 Instead is oil subsidy they know 
4672 2018-07-04 16:17:39 how come US always trying to start war and invade only countries with huge oil deposits ?  or opium ...as it was reported record opium production in Afghanistan after US attacked the country
4673 2018-07-04 16:17:31 Dennis oil can boyd
4674 2018-07-04 16:17:28 Sanders isnt blaming trade deals for less coal jobs.

Coal is dying obviously because the free market prefers oil and nuclear.

They arent blaming Mexicans. They are blaming greedy CEOs.

Calling everyone racist for opposing thinga you dislike takes the power of the word away.
4675 2018-07-04 16:17:16 I ask one simple question. Canada has the best or virtually the best environmental standards for oil & gas production in the world and we have carbon taxes to improve the enviroment. Why then is the price for Canadian oil one of the lowest in the world?
4676 2018-07-04 16:17:07 The problem with Ron Paul is that he can’t stop talking about gold backed Petroyuan when Yuan oil futures contract is launched (go browse sinicization; Tibet; @joshuawongcf & Xinjiang if you want to know about what people Republic think about localization).
4677 2018-07-04 16:17:03 やっべじゃねぇわwwwww
4678 2018-07-04 16:17:02 Why is it that oil changes for vehicles are less expensive in "Africa" where petroleum products & parts are imported & heavily taxed?
4679 2018-07-04 16:16:59 Do not put carrot oil on your body unless you want to become an actual tomato
4680 2018-07-04 16:16:57 Drill deep holes in it fill with oil let sit for a day fill again light it
4681 2018-07-04 16:16:55 When the Oil runs out Man City will be shit again.
4682 2018-07-04 16:16:49 USSR collapsed under the weight of its own failure. I know. I lived there. Venezuela nationalized it’s oil resources, which is most of its economy. Tell me how that squares with your statement above. Socialism, let alone communism. Does not work. Anywhere, ever.

4685 2018-07-04 16:16:41 "Take the oil. So stupid not to take the oil"
4686 2018-07-04 16:16:38 This gambit is nothing more that an attempt to force America to become beholden to Russia for its oil. That is why trump is hitting the countries in the Middle East, undermining our oil supply from there. Middle East oil price will go up & ta da Russian oil is only choice.
4687 2018-07-04 16:16:36 “Well you could infuse pork fat with cannabis that shouldn’t be too difficult and then top it with mayonnaise made with cannabis-infused oil and oh he’s joking.”

4690 2018-07-04 16:16:22 Hi Ellie, nice to meet you here, 
I can express three reasons here why there is NO recovery not slow, first of all is Iraq depends only on Oil for its economy, second bad management, third is racism or sectarianism.
4691 2018-07-04 16:16:13 i usually reduce bananas and increase olive oil and also coconut oil - one or two teaspoons per day. helps a lot

4693 2018-07-04 16:15:58 Dearest Son, Is it really worth it? All of this & you still can’t afford undershirts or absorbent oil sheets for your forehead. We plan to move back to the old country if you destroy this democracy. Please don’t look for us. Your mother, Miriam Miller #secondcivilwarletter

4697 2018-07-04 16:15:42 Check your Engine oil this weekend.

4699 2018-07-04 16:15:36 Dearest Wife, 

Wi-Fi is sketch. I don't know how long I'll have before I'm able to Kik you again. The Battles have been lit AF and there's not much time to upload vids. I'm almost out of vape oil and soy based MRE's. Give my love to the cat, fam

4700 2018-07-04 16:15:27 Very curious how that acorn shell got inside the cabin air filter in the Camry (dislodged when filter replaced during oil change, also scaring off a generation or two of dust bunnies). Glad it was easy to remove to quiet the fan noise.
4701 2018-07-04 16:15:27 Can Never have enough coconut oil!
4702 2018-07-04 16:15:26 Bio oil works miracle and i just orderded me the biggest jug of that shit
4703 2018-07-04 16:15:24 I’m dead set against waste of oil and blowing it out our tail pipe heating the planet, while we sit in line for a $2 Timmy’s. A strict oil Conservation plan is needed with expanded renewables
4704 2018-07-04 16:15:18 @JustinTrudeau Hi Justin!
Do the right thing and stop investing our money in polluting and dangerous oil sands exploration and pipelines! Protect our people and environment from corporate greed! Be brave and support sustainable energy projects!
4705 2018-07-04 16:15:17 It's a leftover from the 44 year reign of Conservatives who think Albertan's have forgotten they gave away AB's future with cheap oil  royalties and bad fiscal management.  They are desperate to return to the good ole' boys days.
4706 2018-07-04 16:14:57 What question?

About itchy swollen vagina?

If it's on its own, I recommend a strong anti biotic.........

Or lube

Durex play seems to be the business

Coconut oil is good too, coz it prevents thrush.......i think
4707 2018-07-04 16:14:55 You guys should try diced tomatoes w salt, pepper and olive oil 
Super nice and refreshing
4708 2018-07-04 16:14:55 What minds? They have zombie brains with one thing only on their mind. Trump
4709 2018-07-04 16:14:48 Im tried with the local stan 
4710 2018-07-04 16:14:45 I was curious because I usually don't have sweat issues (I use Estee Lauder doublewear) but I do have oil control issues and it breaks down my makeup during the day.
4711 2018-07-04 16:14:37 Throw a towel on this and it turns into a hot oil treatment
4712 2018-07-04 16:14:34 There’s full information in our market opening message Lizzie (see above link) and on our Facebook page, but it’s due to a decision made by @foodassembly HQ to close the platform. We’ll be operating @LeithFA in its current form until end of July.
4713 2018-07-04 16:14:14 Hope you fried them in olive oil!  Doing so protects the Omega 3 in the fish
4714 2018-07-04 16:14:14 Olive Oil ain't gon' be able to tear your racist aunt like you will.
4715 2018-07-04 16:14:11 And didn’t he tell us we had enough oil to last another 250 years?  This is about lining the pockets of the oil industry aide heaven forbid someone else make some $$.
4716 2018-07-04 16:14:08 Kinda close to what I am doing but no mayo. Just going with lime juice and olive oil because the avocado is our creamy fat.
4717 2018-07-04 16:13:59 Petrol and Diesel prices are the almost same as it was in 2013. even price of crude oil has been decreased to more than half but still price of petrol and diesel is same in india.

4718 2018-07-04 16:13:55 Put coconut oil onto sliced eggplant with salt and grill it. Trust me.
4719 2018-07-04 16:13:40 Idea of a righteous war. Protecting our oil supply in Kuwait . Many tens of thousands in the street the day before here in Seattle and elsewhere disagreed.
4720 2018-07-04 16:13:30 Oil
4721 2018-07-04 16:13:22 So how is that a resolution to the crisis? The crisis here being NOT an "attempt to divert & sell #Libya's oil outside" #NOC. This is just an inability to assess the motives behind the move. Step away from the formulaic position and look again, there might be an opportunity here.
4722 2018-07-04 16:13:19 Hey Venezuela has oil too!
4723 2018-07-04 16:13:18 Since you’re clueless, this wouldn’t really be beneficial to you. Go buy some snake oil from JBP and live happily in ignorance.
4724 2018-07-04 16:13:15 As we have seen, voters doesn't want experience. They want a snake oil salesman to tell them some "chicken in every pot" lies. It's sad but true. If we don't run a superhero we could be in trouble. I'm scared.
4725 2018-07-04 16:13:13 I agree, we should invest in renewables etc, but we still need both regimes to move forward. Our club (VEVA) own a 1912 Detroit Electric. It was not mass produced because the batteries were housed in glass cases that easily ruptured. We needed 100 yrs of oil advances to get Tesla
4726 2018-07-04 16:13:10 Haven't had bananas in two years. Olive oil isn't a big part of my diet at all.
4727 2018-07-04 16:13:01 Dear Family, 
We are half way home. We can see the #MAGAts have been here as the road is heavily littered with golf balls, burned out tiki torches (they had no backup lantern oil), slim jim & pork rind wrappers, diet Coke cans, red baseball caps everywhere.

4728 2018-07-04 16:13:00 So none of these individuals use oil or gas?
4729 2018-07-04 16:12:47 Palm oil is still technically classed by the food industry as suitable for those on a vegan diet.
4730 2018-07-04 16:12:44 Invade Venezuela?  He has lost all sense of reality. Even to consider the thought. He prob wants oil. And, a place to ship all the Latino immigrants.
4731 2018-07-04 16:12:34 Oh, say can you tweet?Oh, say can you tweet, by the dawn’s early light?

4732 2018-07-04 16:12:30 Under capitalism, resources are hoarded&kept scarce in order to maintain worth&allow sellers to keep the price high.Billions of barrels-worth of oil sitting underground&in stores,kept there to keep the price high. There is already plenty,it needs to be liberated from capitalists.
4733 2018-07-04 16:12:30 Stop hating plzzzzzz
4734 2018-07-04 16:12:01 Some very special bath oil. It's very rejuvenating. Very.
4735 2018-07-04 16:11:57 It's either something to do with the chicken they use or the oil they fry their chips in!
4736 2018-07-04 16:11:53 WTF? It's official they have lost their freaking Minds LOL
4737 2018-07-04 16:11:42 Oil alone isnt enough to moisturize. You should look into an actual hair moisturizer or a good leave in conditioner. Try layering your products. Its called the LOC method, Liquid, Oil, Cream. So water, oil, moisturizer. It works. I recommend Kinky Curly Knot Today
4738 2018-07-04 16:11:21 why is that?? Is Leith Food Assembly folding???????
4739 2018-07-04 16:11:16 Trump remains the conspiratorial malcontent and snake oil salesman he's always been.
The GOP uses him as a battering ram, because he enjoys it, and they profit. 

I'm going fishing.

4742 2018-07-04 16:10:59 $60 isn’t bad if that includes the price of the oil
4743 2018-07-04 16:10:57 Not only did my boyfriend pay for his oil change but he paid for mine too #HesTheBest 
4744 2018-07-04 16:10:53 It’s actually a pink cloak to show how manly he is  it was a painted a while ago but I’m pretty sure it’s screamer pink shaded with screamer pink and black mix, nuln oil, then highlights of pink horror, emperors children.
4745 2018-07-04 16:10:52 Shouldn't a low carbon economy call for a significant decline in oil use and a reduction in natural gas use?

4750 2018-07-04 16:10:34 Why are those reps in Moscow? We don’t need anything as a nation from Russia. Nothing. Not even oil. Why are they there and no democrats are? Why does Trump want to meet Putin alone? Who on the advance team took the most money from Russia? Think any of them will discuss MH17?
4751 2018-07-04 16:10:31 I was trying as well but what can I say the Ass is Spectacular. I jst wanna massage it first ngama oil before I give her the Strokes of Kratos. God please I can fast alcohol for this ass

4757 2018-07-04 16:10:15 Well to be honest i’m really did not see why US is still there in the first place... ISIS is pretty much gone; Syria did not have a meaningful oil production and YPG should have seen this coming.

4764 2018-07-04 16:09:14 3.) As a face primer & moisturiser ~ coconut oil is a great primer and makes your face smooth and prepped for a smooth makeup application! Using coconut oil as a moisturiser is also great, applying some before you go to sleep which will keep your skin hydrating and reparing! :)
4765 2018-07-04 16:09:12 One finger gets stained by oil, the rest gets share. All the reasons you need, in summary.
4766 2018-07-04 16:09:09 Use baby oil, conditioner or coconut oil instead of shaving cream.
4767 2018-07-04 16:09:09 The other day at work this woman came in off her face and she kept apologizing to me for the smell of oil because she worked in a kitchen "no worries love I can only smell pure GANJA"
4768 2018-07-04 16:09:08 A 10 year old report? Have your heard of the fracking revolution? We're not going to run out of oil, or any other fossil fuel any time soon.  Still waiting for someone to dispute the BP report with facts, preferably not "alternative facts"

4775 2018-07-04 16:08:22 Negotiating a couple of free oil changes when we bought a car a few months ago is probably one of the best decisions I've made lately
4776 2018-07-04 16:08:21 They are well paid for these antics by foreign oil interests.
4777 2018-07-04 16:08:17 We met our goal to remove microbeads from our products globally by the end of 2017! The alternative ingredients we have chosen to replace microbeads are cellulose, which comes from wood, tree bark, and wood pulp, as well as hydrogenated jojoba oil.
4778 2018-07-04 16:08:15 Palm oil has a pretty bad rep - and quite justifiably so - but according to the @guardian and @IUCN "[...] alternatives are likely to drive biodiversity losses elsewhere, rather than halt them." So instead of abandoning palm oil altogether, we need to ensure it's sustainable.
4779 2018-07-04 16:08:14  A country rich in Oil gets a handout from London

4783 2018-07-04 16:07:50 Pay attention America these people  are traitors. They are in Russia to collect money for their vote on an oil pipeline. They will be asking for your vote one day.
4784 2018-07-04 16:07:49 And then again everything- wood, peat , coal, natural gas and even oil is just stored solar energy.
4785 2018-07-04 16:07:47 I like oil pens bc they’re convenient and odorless but them hoes do not last me a week.....whereas weed would :’(
4786 2018-07-04 16:07:47 I dropped actual peppermint oil on an ant trail recently and they all laughed at me.
4787 2018-07-04 16:07:42 If I can recommend anything, grab some tea tree oil. Add a drop or two into your facial cleanser when you wash your face. Tea tree oil was my holy grail for so long.
4788 2018-07-04 16:07:39 And all it took was a phone call.  I think they realize their oil days are numbered.  Soon all they'll have left is sand and cement isn't in short supply . . .

4790 2018-07-04 16:07:38 #OOTT One of the biggest variables in the oil supply equation is TIME. #shale has skewed this variable. As this variable corrects (over time) I think we will see the back end of the curve correct to the front end.
4791 2018-07-04 16:07:37 no agreement for oil ! !
4792 2018-07-04 16:07:35 Ive been having my coffee with butter and coconut oil...

4795 2018-07-04 16:07:21 It’s not insane from his perspective. Easy win following Reagan template. Plus he takes the oil. His base will love it and he can label anti invasion people as socialists before the election.
4796 2018-07-04 16:07:18 This largely due to Democrat States with extremely high state gas taxes. As oil prices haven't peaked as high as they were 10-15 years ago. So blaming prices on high oil prices is not logical! Take that price and subtract the State taxes alone in California and see what it is!
4797 2018-07-04 16:07:18 Coconut oil is such an amazing facial moisturizer omg I can't even

4808 2018-07-04 16:05:32 2.) For hair growth ~ if you want your hair to grow faster & be thicker apply coconut oil to your hair as often as you want as for as long as you like, there’s so set limit! I usually coat my hair in it really focusing on massaging the roots and then leaving it on overnight :)

4810 2018-07-04 16:05:27 I'm also now cynical about Theresa May suddenly having a change of heart (more like a change of oil filter) to raise money for the NHS through extra taxation (#brexitdividend???).
Is this just getting the NHS in adequate shape before the sell off? (never trust a Tory).
4811 2018-07-04 16:05:27 /Oh yeah sure. Lemme go slather myself in cooking oil while I am at it in this 90+ degree heat so I can be well done-
4812 2018-07-04 16:05:27 In the UK Scotland is expected to suffer the manipulation of our democracy with #ToryDarkMoney theft of 1/3 of a Billion £’s, reclassification of 45% of our Oil revenue all while our elected representatives who actually stand against this are treated like shit! #DissolveTheUnion
4813 2018-07-04 16:05:01 I have never once owned or considered buying an essential oil diffuser so feel free to sub me 
4814 2018-07-04 16:04:52 It's not an opportune time to talk about rarely yielding right after Modi prostrated before Nikki Haley & accepted to comply with providing annual tributes in oil.

4821 2018-07-04 16:04:17 I actually always wonder what you really think about the US and your devout followers when all I see from you is lies or deception to peddle your content in return for their hard earned dollars. You’re a snake oil salesman and I hate to think how little you think of Americans
4822 2018-07-04 16:04:07 The proven oil reserves in Venezuela are recognized as the largest in the world, totaling 297 billion barrels (4.72×1010 m3) as of 1 January 2014.

4826 2018-07-04 16:03:28 Waiting for Tilly to get her oil changed. Gotta make sure my car baby is ready for the journey over the mountains this weekend! I'm going to see Grandma & fam I haven't seen in YEARS. I've come so far-I wonder what they've all been up to. What's the word for nervous/excited?
4827 2018-07-04 16:03:15 Cooking oil= Fish oil
Toothpaste = Colgate
4828 2018-07-04 16:03:14 On this Independence Day, I will be grilling on my Korean-made grill, wearing my Japanese wrestling shirt, while listening to Swedish metal.

Then I'm going to use Middle Eastern oil products to drive and watch Chinese invented pyrotechnics.

4830 2018-07-04 16:03:02 Who would have thought I’d be eating a kale salad with sliced almonds, parmesan cheese and oil based dressing? Don’t knock it til you try it 
4831 2018-07-04 16:02:56 Shaving your legs with coconut oil is honestly the best
4832 2018-07-04 16:02:54 Once again,  it's about oil.

Hum...where have I seen this before?

Iraq? Afghanistan? 

No way,  that was about terrorism. That was also a Republican president.

4836 2018-07-04 16:02:16 And she now holds the title of being the best selling female rapper of all time. We have many other great rappers as well such as Lauryn Hill, Missy Elliott, Lil’ Kim, etc., but Minaj has risen to the very top – being the best selling of them ALL.
4837 2018-07-04 16:02:12 Dear Ma,

The Libtard Brigade has had our biggest victory. We captured a bunch of Red Hats with the lure of “Free Bullets, Beer, and Bikini Girls”. They are locked up in the barn, smells real bad. Please send more lavender essential oil. 

Sincerely,

4839 2018-07-04 16:02:05 1.) To remove makeup ~ coconut oil is one of the best ways to remove it, massage a small amount into your skin and then rinse with warm water ~ this is a very quick and effective way to remove makeup with no rubbing or tugging of your skin :)
4840 2018-07-04 16:01:59 Okay sis then tell me who in this pic are from 90's ? You're the only person here keep bringing the old mcc in this discussion
4841 2018-07-04 16:01:55 What coal mine will step up for its nuking?

Coal's in the ground. Oil's in the ground.

Bombs can hit pipelines.  Bombs can hit highways.

The President opens his mouth and stupid comes out. #OurDailyEmbarrassment
4842 2018-07-04 16:01:54 As an owner of the Pipeline, Canadians can now control who we sell the oil to & for what purpose & price. Meaningful manufactured products is preferred versus burning it out out tail pipes. As Mass Consumers, we have more say at the pump, if we purchase EVs instead of ICE.
4843 2018-07-04 16:01:44 Coconut oil is a natural cleanser for bacteria. Coconut oil hydrates the HECK outta your hair & skin. Is a bomb cuticle oil. The best shaving cream Packed with nutrition & healthy fats. Good for your dogs health & coat. Is there anything coconut oil CANT do
4844 2018-07-04 16:01:28 Dirty sand oil remains dirty sand oil. On top of that, this oil will fuel the Chinese economy. Best thing is to leave this oil in the ground.
4845 2018-07-04 16:01:20 Your Horse magazine kindly asked me again to do an article, this time on feeding oil, it’s in this months copy! Feeling proud 
4846 2018-07-04 16:01:15 India should combat oil dependency
4847 2018-07-04 16:01:11 Oil. Always about oil, and those it impowers. (Divest divest divest.) Models show alternatives are already more economical. Only war can keep oil in power.

4855 2018-07-04 16:00:05 I added oil in it, next time I’ll try chicken. I put a tiny bit then it all boiled and evaporated and they started to burn and stick 
4856 2018-07-04 15:59:59 Sort of... servings of grain (crust); olive oil, seed oils, mushrooms, olives, tomatoes and peppers and pineapple are approved, just avoid saturated fat and red meat

4860 2018-07-04 15:59:38 A summer spa day sounds like a great idea, @jwhittalTWN. Customize your treatment with Cooling Balancing Oil Concentrate or Peppermint Essential Oil+Base to chill out even more! ^lg
4861 2018-07-04 15:59:27 lmfao  remember that time i accidentally put oil in the eye and it caught on fire?

4863 2018-07-04 15:59:17 You can here that the oil is CLEARLY TOO DAMN hot
4864 2018-07-04 15:59:15 I don’t like Trump but I don’t believe this for a minute.
He’s been talking about this for over a decade, about spending more $ over seas in wars than here
Yes, he said we should’ve taken the oil but he was speaking on a more reimbursement terms. 
He wants out of Syria
4865 2018-07-04 15:59:12 Jadi tiap malem akhir2 ini aku pake facial oil baru punya adikku. Warnanya item kaya oli bekas, aromanya jangan ditanya ya buibuk, tapi abis pake itu mukanya plump , seger, kaya mbak2 early 20 gitu
4866 2018-07-04 15:59:04 questions for #boomers

1. what was your CB handle?

2. when did you get your first car?

3. how much was gas during the oil crisis?

4. what is the greatest amount of people not related to you that you’ve lived with at one time?

5. if you went to college, how much did it cost?

4870 2018-07-04 15:58:50 Do you want to try CBD oil? I have $25 gift cards for new clients! Comment below if you’re ready to take back your health! 

4871 2018-07-04 15:58:44 Petition governments to dedicate all taxes from resource extraction including the significant amount of coal exported from port of Van to green energy! We need oil to transition and the money from fossil fuels can finance it!
4872 2018-07-04 15:58:43 
Do you wear clothes, shoes live in a house/apartment? Or do you run around naked living in the forest with the tiny bearded miners?
Golly gee whiz.....like the other person said...how did u even post that?
No money no oil just lotsa hot air... No wonder the earth is heating up
4873 2018-07-04 15:58:26 If you don’t know how to do an Oil change on your car then why tf do you have a car
4874 2018-07-04 15:58:10 Ragazzo, se lei avesse comprato oil nel 1999lo avesse rivenduto nel 2000, quanto avrebbe guadagnato?
4875 2018-07-04 15:58:08 stop shooting up schools like most americans. stop invading countries for oil like most americans. stop separating mexican children from their families at the border. stop fucking your cousins like most americans get out of my mentions you rat
4876 2018-07-04 15:58:01 Yesterday I got Lucy cbd oil (for pets obviously) from the dispensary and I highly recommended it if your pet gets really bad anxiety from the fire works !  It kept her calm all night 
4877 2018-07-04 15:57:58 i hope everyone left oil and hotdogs out for George Washington’s ghost last night
4878 2018-07-04 15:57:46 They're not intellectuals, they're snake oil peddlers.
Jordan Peterson is wrong about literally everything he talks about, even things that are relevant to his field (most of his material is actually unrelated to his degree)
I'm on a break from my decently-paying job, btw.
4879 2018-07-04 15:57:28 He's selling snake oil
4880 2018-07-04 15:57:23 I was huddled backstage in a wig that covered my eyes while having my feet shoved into boots several sizes too small w the help of baby oil, but I still **felt** history being written  in that moment
4881 2018-07-04 15:57:08 The ignorance and hypocrisy of these radical morons is incredible. Enimma should be wearing a paper or tin foil hat, not plastic made with oil.
4882 2018-07-04 15:57:01 I talked shit about my oil the first time. Had me fried otw home later that day
4883 2018-07-04 15:56:56 Yasss! Did you boil chicken in the water or add oil so they don’t stick? And it’s really a little bit of water, I made that mistake before lol
4884 2018-07-04 15:56:42 @GraceandFrankie great show, truly well casted, wonderful writing and music. There’s one gaping hole with Frankie’s character that I can’t get past. Since she is passionate about the boar, palm oil, fur coats, and a vegetarian, there is noooo way she would touch cheese.
4885 2018-07-04 15:56:32 Marketing, doesn’t oil market itself
4886 2018-07-04 15:56:08 My guess: from the close up photo it's a new rim, still has machining oil residue from the process to make the grooves, creates rainbows like oil slicks on the road after it rains, rainbows are banded because of the grooves, and weird colors b/c of differences in oil thickness
4887 2018-07-04 15:55:41 Nothing in UN but everything in Russian S-400 and Iranian Oil.

4897 2018-07-04 15:55:01 My Darling, Skills of moving behind enemy lines learned last Thanksgiving have served me well.  I have found their tiki oil and big macs.  Will destroy their lighting, food, and morale in one act. Watch for the flames. #secondcivilwarletters

4899 2018-07-04 15:54:56 This is the prime example of Turkish crazy policies... It has nothing yo do with them in what's happening in Syria... And they. They are fighting Kurds in Syria.. 
This is the same Turkey that trained Isis and so nusra terrorists and for years bought oil from that evil, Isis.
4900 2018-07-04 15:54:49 Its kind of funny hearing Trumpers waxing lyrical about Venezuela being proof that socialism cant ever work, when the actual main issue is that they were overly reliant on Oil. A fossil fuel. Who else loves fossil fuels? 
4901 2018-07-04 15:54:46 You don’t add water when making vegetable soup. Your palm oil and the water from your parboiled meat and all should serve
4902 2018-07-04 15:54:44 Entertain the idea that he either wants to be impeached or he is in the middle of selling the USA out to Russia NK tri-unity.
Oil prices would go down... but damn... we are all going to miss freedom.

YOU #MAGA'S okay with the @realDonaldTrump giving up freedom?

4906 2018-07-04 15:54:17 My dearest Jedediah, Morale is low. We are blocked in on the east and west. The red hats are blasting, “God Bless the USA” in hopes that we will give up. But we have a secret weapon, diffusers full of patchouli oil. Wish us luck. #secondcivilwarletter

4923 2018-07-04 15:52:11 America was cheap.

All the Russians had to do was bribe less than 100 citizens and fund up a few divisive foundations. 

Probably didn't even cost them six months of oil profits. Well played.
4924 2018-07-04 15:52:08 British want to exit European Union to have chance to destroy Biafra land in Nigeria they created and replace us with jihadis.

4934 2018-07-04 15:51:25 Only £95 to get Joyous Frankly to stop spraying engine oil all over the roadway. Quite happy about that!

4939 2018-07-04 15:50:58 Revolution for Democracy is not too far in Iran. uncertainty in Iran will impact India's oil supply Though India cut down oil import from Iran but balanced Oil & gas stock from US, Russia, Saudi & UAE; this govt step shows concerns for securing its needs with major oil suppliers.
4940 2018-07-04 15:50:51 My boss is coming to my house tonight to talk about her essential oil business. 

Honestly. Can she just not?

4943 2018-07-04 15:50:29 I use to have chronic chapped lips and I stopped using wax based chapsticks.  I also will exfoliate my lips 2-3 times a week and put coconut oil on my lips before bed.  After a few weeks you’ll notice a HUGE difference.  I also take 2400mg of Omega 3.
4944 2018-07-04 15:50:28 FYI:  An excellent way to ruin your just-made cup of coffee is to drop a gel cap of fish oil into it.

4947 2018-07-04 15:50:11 "Worst movie" is a matter of personal taste.
"Dirtiest oil" is not. CO2 content (the "dirty" part for AGW cultists) is scientifically determined.
Get a clue.
4948 2018-07-04 15:50:07 Dear Mom...I overslept, so I rushed over to the library to offer backup. They had it under control though. Turns out that hiding in the non fiction aisle was the perfect camouflage. Yayyyy! Ive heard we captured Pilot Oil and stole their flag. Off to Walmart!!  #SecondCivilWar

4950 2018-07-04 15:49:55 As long as you have removed the oil you should be ok.
4951 2018-07-04 15:49:42 Perhaps the Alberta government should fund protests against OPEC oil entering Canada?
4952 2018-07-04 15:49:36 Which will also lower availability and allow the price of oil to remain high with reason. Renewables are taking hold and we're seeing pump prices in Canada comparable to when barrel prices were well over $100.
4953 2018-07-04 15:49:30 Horses!  They're the bestest!  No oil, who cares, they'll eat hay.  And you can fertilize your garden with their waste products.  Always wanted a surrey with a fringe on top...
4954 2018-07-04 15:49:17 No big deal.... it'll be like it was back Pre-fits when people bought solar to stop the oil wars, piss the banks and energy companies off. BTW, I've just had a subsidy free solar system installed and most of our clients didn't even know they could still be paid for generating.
4955 2018-07-04 15:49:10 gold crude ratio tells u   oil run up above 75 can be very strong

4957 2018-07-04 15:49:02 A very troubling article. And then in the other breath he says America shouldn’t get involved in foreign conflicts. Of course he’d like the Venezuelan oil! Maybe he’ll decide to invade Canada since we’re causing him so much grief! He makes me so nervous and angry

4963 2018-07-04 15:48:13 Planning to make these today. Did you not have to use a binding agent like flax seeds or coconut oil?
4964 2018-07-04 15:48:12 How could it be the greatest? I thought it was time for MAGA. Aren’t all you Republicans trying to make it great again?  What a con job but seriously I agree with you if we can quit listening to the snake oil salesman and respect this great country and all it’s people /traditions
4965 2018-07-04 15:48:11 As long as oil and gas companies continue to pay old white guys to say it doesn't exist.

4969 2018-07-04 15:47:46 We're not exactly oil paintings
4970 2018-07-04 15:47:26 sooo...baby oil used as lotion is pretty fukkin great. life pro tip right here.
4971 2018-07-04 15:47:17 I would have joined the national guard mainly since they respond to oil spills and the work outs and the loans they pay for you. The armed forces will give whomever a gun. But not me because they cant give me an inhaler.
4972 2018-07-04 15:47:10 If you’re not cutting about with an itsy bitsy teeny weeny leopard print bikini, slabbered in coconut oil with your slippers on, then you’re not me.
4973 2018-07-04 15:47:08 The last one is my fave it controls the oil the best for me.
4974 2018-07-04 15:47:05 Banyak gak investment dia apart from oil & gas ni. So far aku tak jumpa lg la issue berat pasal dia. Its not that bad la. Yg penting, official website dia cantik gila

4977 2018-07-04 15:46:26 My sinuses have been giving me the blues, but I just tried eucalyptus oil on my temples and I feel a difference.
4978 2018-07-04 15:46:25 Love your work. Just wish the liberals would leave the oil in the ground. Instead of combining sales and carbon tax. Canada one large per metric ton carbon tax. It would give dividends to Canadians on energy saving. Carbon tax would help the economy.
4979 2018-07-04 15:46:23 This is purely anecdotal, and I have no idea how it contributes to the numbers here, but the oil industry recruits heavily from veterans. I had more than a few people pushing me to go work in Alaska or North Dakota when I was separating from active duty.
4980 2018-07-04 15:46:16 I'm curious to know how the CBD oil goes. For puppers you can also try a baby benedryl for occasional stressors (ie road trips, fireworks). 1mg per pound  so for a 25lb dog one tablet works. Do check with your vet before giving it tho
4981 2018-07-04 15:46:08 Gotta wash my car and changed the oil 
4982 2018-07-04 15:45:55 While your at it Google what's needed to run all those industries......um oil!
4983 2018-07-04 15:45:49 This seems like an Oil and Water mix. Wonder how long this lasts.
4984 2018-07-04 15:45:39 Check your Engine oil this Sunday.
4985 2018-07-04 15:45:36 We are sorry Germany that whether you eat your soil or not you are flammable. Did Russia feed you oil?
4986 2018-07-04 15:45:34 That was the centerpiece of Trump first foreign policy speech.  Not only did he say take the oil but give it to the veterans.  Basically a pillage and plunder policy.

4988 2018-07-04 15:45:14 that Garlic/Coconut oil i bought did so much justice! serving its purpose 
4989 2018-07-04 15:45:13 Is that GT7 silicone lube though? This isn't your regular WD40 penetrating oil.
4990 2018-07-04 15:45:13 Still... I'd rather see other oil producing crops growing in  Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Indiana, Nebraska, Ohio, Missouri, South Dakota, Arkansas, North Dakota & Kansas, where there are no orangutans #PalmOil

4994 2018-07-04 15:44:59 It should be great time for Canada to look for agriculture and crude oil export to China,. China should be the time to reorganize these kinds of import to prepare for trade war . If everything had been settled done, then chance would be rare.
4995 2018-07-04 15:44:50 yes, they deserve medals for risking their lives to enrich the defense industry, the oil industry, and the giant corporations that rule this country.
4996 2018-07-04 15:44:49 ทำไมต้องห่วงชีวิตคนอื่นด้วย
4997 2018-07-04 15:44:43 just tried oil. gross.
4998 2018-07-04 15:44:35 there are only two ages where oil baths are not sensual and that’s when you’re a baby and when you’re a fifty year old wrestler

5002 2018-07-04 15:44:03 You can get oil from sand but can't get meaning from Pawan. Assuming he read more books, he is theory person with out practical knowledge.
5003 2018-07-04 15:44:01 jenna: "you know that come get y'all juice vine well mom just spilt vegetable oil all over the kitchen so come get y'all juice"
5004 2018-07-04 15:44:01 3) Basic capitalism in supply and demand. Demand is rising for alternative energies. Government allowed oil and coal to dominate the energy sector and their lobbies won't let go, harming our economy. Don't get pissy at environmentalists for the mistakes of government and lobbies.
5005 2018-07-04 15:43:56 Castor oil is really healing my skin allergies like crazy, it soothed the itching too, wow
5006 2018-07-04 15:43:53 Scott Pruitt deserves scorn. Not only is he a tool of the oil and gas industry when he’s supposed to be protecting our environment, he exhibits poor judgment and lack of leadership. I wish @realDonaldTrump would get rid of him.
5007 2018-07-04 15:43:45 What s the name of your oil?
5008 2018-07-04 15:43:36 Welp get ya scalp oil, growth grease, comb, hair pic ready then
5009 2018-07-04 15:43:34 Yeah, it is, but you’d be surprised how many times I’ve seen cars go 20, 30k without oil change and complain when we tell them it’s their fault why their engine seized up
5010 2018-07-04 15:43:30 Hopefully my oil plug working today I need a major re up

5012 2018-07-04 15:43:23 Today has been fantastic, @pepboysauto changed my oil at a discount and forgot to put the cap back on, almost blew me to high hell. 

God Bless America.
5013 2018-07-04 15:43:22 They're not stupid, they're sending propoganda and conspiracy theories to the radical right which they've learned will believe in any snake oil they're presented with. This is deception the the nth degree and it's dangerous.
5014 2018-07-04 15:43:22 Audio: Michael Oliver explains why he is turning cautious on oil and copper but super bullish on the grains, bearish on the dollar and bullish on the monetary metals, gold and silver. He remains hugely bearish on U.S. Treasuries and looks for big stair step declines in stocks
5015 2018-07-04 15:43:20 The president has tried to cut humanitarian funding by billions. If you think we were going to invade to feed Venezuelans, and to not take their oil, than you haven't been paying attention.

5028 2018-07-04 15:41:49 I’m flying home in the morning and my goals is to go to my dad house lay across his bed and say “I’m broke and I need an oil change” with my puppy eyes

5038 2018-07-04 15:41:11 Yes, always someone else, other than the filthy oil rich Muslim Arab countries, to help. Interesting how Quatar, Kuwait, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, etc are always absent when the calls to help their fellow Muslim Arab brothers are made. They, for once, can take their own people in.
5039 2018-07-04 15:41:02 A&d has some bad chemicals in it! Don’t use it anymore!

5071 2018-07-04 15:38:06 Friend ran a campaign for Mokole' (weredragons). You can take 'huge size' multiple times. The short of it? Knocked over an oil rig in an attempt to just shake it. It was a critical success. All he said was "there goes chapter 2", threw out the sheet, and continued on. Lol

5075 2018-07-04 15:37:55 Without oil there won't be much happening at all. A fake economy created by taxpayers money will never last, it's been tried over and over. It's what politicians do when they don't have the guts to make hard decisions.
5076 2018-07-04 15:37:49 yeah youre a fool if you just throw oil in the pot lol

Donning armor of sunscreen SPF +50 (mineral based not chemical based) sun hat and sunglasses, I ready for the Battle of the Lawn Sprinkler to pick fresh summer tomatoes. 

I expect carnage.  I have neem oil.

5081 2018-07-04 15:37:15 Next goal is mechanic. That shit is fun and a lot of those motherfuckers that I do know, want you sucking their dick for something as small as an oil change when you're willing to pay them.

5084 2018-07-04 15:36:54 Wow #toyota I'm impressed an actual spin on oil filter on my iM.  Welcome to the 1960s. Very glad you finally changed to modern filter.  But you are going to lose money on that special tool you needed to remove the old filters.

5086 2018-07-04 15:36:36 It's not just cheap oil, the loan has geopolitical implications.
5087 2018-07-04 15:36:31 What oil are you going to run? Needing suggestions for my rb20
5088 2018-07-04 15:36:25 Try this! 1 cup camel milk, juice of two lemons, 2 tbsp coconut oil, 1 cup blueberries, 1 frozen banana, 4 raw eggs, 1/2 tsp vanilla
5089 2018-07-04 15:36:25 I’ve been wondering how long it’d take Iran to realize their best play is stop all oil exports.

5095 2018-07-04 15:35:37 An enlightening facial mask, vivid red, with yeast, rosewood oil, and exfoliating softwood microbeads. It comes as a sparkling liquid.
5096 2018-07-04 15:35:32 I wonder what "the old engine oil " is.
5097 2018-07-04 15:35:29 Hi honey have you tried the vapour oil from @breazeallergy I’ve found it to be really soothing
5098 2018-07-04 15:35:29 Uniform of the Day is, naked with jungle boots and a light coat of motor oil.
5099 2018-07-04 15:35:28 @ArkissI aunty wanted to fly go and come plus 200k. U have seen oil tycoon
5100 2018-07-04 15:35:23 Not so fun fact: Even two little rags (size of wash cloths), when full of linseed oil and left in a little clump, can combust, stink up your whole house, scare the crap out of you, and start your 4th of July off NOT interested in any fireworks. Be safe out there!
5101 2018-07-04 15:35:18 I promise I never been higher than after a proper breath work session. , yes the herb helps relax the muscles etc , but the smoke is very acidic and toxic at the end of the day u are ingesting burnt plant matter, tea is def the move or cbd oil.
5102 2018-07-04 15:35:06 I can do most car maintenance.

I've changed tires. Alternators. Oil. Batteries. Topped off fluids. 

That shit isn't impressive nigga.
5103 2018-07-04 15:34:59 This is the most boring #SecondCivilWar, ever. So far the highlight has been sipping cold brew and watching soccer while having the oil changed in my car.

5106 2018-07-04 15:34:54 I hate green tea. But I drank coffee because it helped me get down the coconut oil my doctor and youtube videos recommended. I cant have sugar with either of them so they taste the same level of unappealing. 

But the green tea will stain my teeth less, and is less bitter so...
5107 2018-07-04 15:34:41 Oklahoma needs to raise taxes on fast food, stop giving oil & gas subsidies and huge tax breaks to corporations, start taxing politically active churches. Think of all the revenue that'd bring.  Until then, stop taxing the fuck out of my cigarettes.

5108 2018-07-04 15:34:40 If the Saudis want to really put the squeeze on the current Iranian regime, a pipeline to the red Sea, to divert oil from the Straits of Hormuz will accomplish that. @purpleline
5109 2018-07-04 15:34:39 Coconut oil and sunscreen
5110 2018-07-04 15:34:18 couldn't they work out a deal that the SDF still takes the area  but SAA Heavy artillery is providing covering fire from across the river given thats something they greatly lack. for better oil Since they mainly a mobile/ light medium force banking on air power to cause choas.
5111 2018-07-04 15:34:15 Just so you know, authoritarian Malthusian prigs have always been wrong in their dire warnings about overpopulation, peak oil, starvation, global climate disaster, not enough water, and the rest.

Always wrong.

Not you, of course. God forbid if you should read a little Marx.
5112 2018-07-04 15:34:11 Dont think anything is gonna happen to him. Misogynists have been ruling the country since forever, it is the unofficial religion of the country.

5115 2018-07-04 15:33:48 Play with the base. Your pallet. Your rules. I'm not above using tarragon in my own. But often, I just use the oil, the egg and a splash oh a complimentary acid. Now get out there find your avocado bliss.
5116 2018-07-04 15:33:46 Water and oil
5117 2018-07-04 15:33:42 It sounds like half capitalism. One thing is for sure if you struck oil or gold on your property it’s not yours.
5118 2018-07-04 15:33:37 Yes he is. His discourse is to "Make Mexico Great Again" with similar policies. Close borders and increase taxes to encourage growth. Increase oil production. In your analysis @leninology you are not sharing insights on how they are different. You just claim it as a fact. Lame.
5119 2018-07-04 15:33:23 All I know when I cook is I'm not on any Google recipe bullshit. Not on any dietary bullshit. I cook like it's a last supper. Butter, oil, salt, garlic. All in sync. Nothing over seasoned, but nothing calorie restricted or alternated. You want calorie restriction? Eat less.

5125 2018-07-04 15:33:03 @DemosDoesIt you were just talking bout compression jackets for pets during fireworks. My little buddy who is the most afraid of fireworks, I've found diffusing lavender oil in the room seems to calm him down a bit, dread the fourth of July for my pups each year.
5126 2018-07-04 15:32:59 Which started under the tories because so much of AB's revenues are tied to oil prices.

If the price of oil is in the shitter, so are your finances. The only way to solve that is exporting to not-USA via pipelines.
5127 2018-07-04 15:32:45 What a your thoughts on a bounce for rest of week?  It's an oil play and oil is not tanking anytime soon + you cant blame any insider for unloading on this run.  Anyone in their right mind would and should unload after an almost $12 run
5128 2018-07-04 15:32:39 Yep, I've had castor oil 
5129 2018-07-04 15:32:32 Unfortunately that is empirically not true. Modern society depends upon oil for more than just energy.

5153 2018-07-04 15:30:14 @SurreyPolice Hi, there’s a long trail of oil in bike lane on Westfield Rd, Woking (bt New Lane & Westfield Avenue). Very dangerous - came off bike. Could cause a more serious accident.
5154 2018-07-04 15:30:10 if there is PR sponsorship for those calling out men who harass/touch without  consent then pls share their number. Would be useful to us.
5155 2018-07-04 15:30:08 If it's any consolation it prompted me to change my oil and filter and clean all the breathers out on my machine
5156 2018-07-04 15:30:03 Mutti had some foray into chemistry as well (quantum chemistry but chemistry nonetheless). She should know that many substances don't mix, no matter what you do. The most common example is oil and water (or oil and vinegar): they're simply naturally immiscible.

5164 2018-07-04 15:29:05 Norway produces about 20% more oil per capita than Saudi Arabia and about 6 times the oil per capita as we produce here. Don’t let that get in the way of your rant or anything, but the proportions couldn’t be more off, and that’s where all the difference lies.
5165 2018-07-04 15:28:57 Im doing good. Already been for a run, put up some shots. Currently getting an oil change

5168 2018-07-04 15:28:36 Different kinds of oil can give nutrients to your hair. Like coconut, olive, castor, almond, etc. It makes it healthier, shinier, softer, thicker, etc.
5169 2018-07-04 15:28:32 I believe both IRAQ wars were waged to enrich the industrial war machine.  Muslim vs Christian was not the purpose of these armed conflicts.  Oil,  yes...

5171 2018-07-04 15:28:30 For the oil?  What is the oil situation there now?
5172 2018-07-04 15:28:29 Honesty however, the news from yesterday was much bigger.  Those salter they fixed will lead to real production, the Chinese loan who knows.  Is it just a loan for more cheap oil?

5176 2018-07-04 15:27:42 Liar. you speak of promoting renewables but your actions are of destruction to Canada's oil & gas energy sector

5185 2018-07-04 15:26:41 Also, either chamomile tea or CBD oil is helpful if you find they’re stressing out. I had a parrot, who talked up a storm, when we moved 1,800 miles. He screamed and said “what’s happening” for three days. 
5186 2018-07-04 15:26:36 I mean the guy wastes government money left and right and gives oil companies special favors. He should be called out for it in public
5187 2018-07-04 15:26:35 we have also found that it is impossible to get the right texture without adding what seems like inappropriately large quantities of oil and sweet stuff
5188 2018-07-04 15:26:32 that sounds flames. have you some grilled mexican corn with it.  theres a rosemary,olive oil,peppercorn and thyme rub for turkey thats amazing too. more old fashioned but still amazing if made fresh.
5189 2018-07-04 15:26:31 Why should Canada not use the tax dollars from oil and other fossil fuels to fund the transition to renewables?
We need oil to transition to a post oil world and using resource tax dollars to fund the change is financially responsible.

5193 2018-07-04 15:25:53 Here in Canada we subsidize Big Oil more than any other G7 country. Why?
5194 2018-07-04 15:25:50 Baby oil or petroleum jelly, hope it helps!
5195 2018-07-04 15:25:44 it just doesn't make sense to me even though if he left I'd rather see him at Juve than those oil barons in France
5196 2018-07-04 15:25:40 Yeah it's hard to tell with how dirty the floor is, but it doesn't feel or smell like either coolant, engine oil, or steering fluid and those are the only other things that leak on this.
5197 2018-07-04 15:25:40 Oh the horror of sunscreen! I am fair, and the medication I am on makes me even more sun sensitive - it’s hard to believe how quickly I burn. I managed to find some spray sunscreen in spf50 which is more of a dry oil that sinks in quicker - but I’m still averse - & still burn!
5198 2018-07-04 15:25:28 These 2 are 2 smart guys IMHO, having listened at Oil Capital and spoke to one afterwards, I believe genuine and capable.
The proof will b in the first drill results. If they work, great potential here.
It wpn't need ramping!
5199 2018-07-04 15:25:24 Trump fails to say any ting about over 300% tarriffs on tobacco to Canada and over 100% on peanuts.Your milk has hormones in it banned in Canada. USA gets cheap oil and electricity from us. We also get slapped with tarriffs on softwood. USA subsidizes dairy

5206 2018-07-04 15:24:11 Ahh yes, I have seen this before. A typical frying accident - the oil is too hot, the food is wet. Just on a scale big enough to fit a turkey. Perhaps I can fry a drumstick or similar.

5211 2018-07-04 15:23:49 Take raw onion as bread and the palm oil as tea. Thank me later
5212 2018-07-04 15:23:34 Hope I don’t be here for a long time getting my oil changed
5213 2018-07-04 15:23:31 I have about gotten away from marinating. A light coat of olive oil or melted butter, liberal with the coarse ground salt and pepper, a dusting of garlic powder and oregano, and sometimes a little rosemary.  Let it sit for a couple (few) hours at room temp before cooking.
5214 2018-07-04 15:23:27 Bartrand likes to make me deal with the harbormaster. That man always smells like cod liver oil.

5216 2018-07-04 15:23:19 In Cuba there is no wildlife, it’s all been consumed to survive . I assume that is what is happening in Venezuela right now. Importing oil into a country with the richest oil reserves is what you end up with in socialism ! #Socialism #WalkAwayNow #WalkAway

5224 2018-07-04 15:22:22 I support your blockade 2 protect the water! I do think @JustinTrudeau is right in taking over that disaster of a pipeline from U.S. oil interests. We are culpable whether we give U.S. 10 billion or buy it ourselves. Save 6 billion$ & fix it & end pipeline expansion & go green!
5225 2018-07-04 15:22:19 My mom just stopped by my house 
Her usual rants  
Then she digs in her purse to pull out OIL .. she anointed my head hands and feet .. told me to talk to God 

Best advice ever  she just dramatic tho

5239 2018-07-04 15:21:05 The first comment was about Scandinavia and Norway’s as an example. I believe Norway will still be more or less a socialist country even without the oil. It comes down to how you define socialism. They have a free market etc.

5257 2018-07-04 15:18:38 A hundred years ago, Churchill converted England’s navy from coal to oil for – wait for it – national security. Among other things, oil is less vulnerable to striking workers for its production and delivery.

5261 2018-07-04 15:18:21 @EricTrump Iran is openly discussing a blockade of the Straits of Hormuz.  Should we allow that to happen, oil prices will soar WAY above where they are today
5262 2018-07-04 15:18:20 YES!!!!... about time We start Developing it Locally and Ship out The Refined products for Canadians' Consumption, and only sell Excess Products  internationally. not just oil and GAS, but SOLAR AND WIND
5263 2018-07-04 15:18:17 Some guy talk about the oil rig. Lucky guy.

5277 2018-07-04 15:17:03 Jerry Brown is pro oil & has proved it by all his actions for the last 8 years. You might as well ask Trump to stop being a racist. This campaign has never cared about being effective or actually achieving the stated goals or you wouldn’t keep pushing the same failed strategy.
5278 2018-07-04 15:16:44 Iran just told Trump to stick it by threatening to close the Straits of Hormuz. If that happens, oil prices will skyrocket.

No problem BC ships Millions of Tons of COAL to Trump. All terrible enviro regs. Why no protest? Who pays Greenpeace?

5283 2018-07-04 15:16:14 perhaps they discovered from all the drilling in KZN that beneath the surface there are vast reservoirs of oil, vast tracks of titanium, zircon, rutile, and leucoxene. Is it just the land, or whats beneath? The Zulus are being recolonized, through a fake land agenda.
5284 2018-07-04 15:16:14 Or, you know, stop allowing rich people to get richer at the expense of future generations and begin to transition off oil.  That’d be alright.

5288 2018-07-04 15:15:37 Iran says Mihaela Buzarnescu's oil ban on Iran is 'self harm' SHANA
5289 2018-07-04 15:15:35 I’m sure tRumps motives are altruistic and have nothing to do with oil. Besides it would be great practice for when we invade Canada.
5290 2018-07-04 15:15:33 He wants the oil. Sending @VP on a “democracy tour” was a pre-text. @realDonaldTrump said he would have taken the Iraqi oil fields. It is all about the billions.
5291 2018-07-04 15:15:31 Tried to do a good deed, yesterday- gave a meal to a neighbor next of kin. Welcome him warmly, fed him.  In conversation he turned Red (old oil man) .. I let it lie .. said nothing.  Awkward.. let him be embarrassed.  True. Not a civil war story.
5292 2018-07-04 15:15:21 No better way to start off the 4th other than learning how to change the oil in your car 
5293 2018-07-04 15:15:08 Reports indicate that Kellyanne Conway allowed oil drilling in Chuck Schumer, but you were too distracted by Trump's tweets to notice. A disaster!

5299 2018-07-04 15:14:30 That's because they are beholden to the oil lobbyists and the bankers providing the massive allocations of money for these projects.

5303 2018-07-04 15:14:20 Sequence VIIIそのものは40時間の試験なのですが、粘度の測定は10時間で採取したものですね。油温は143℃で回転は3150rpmという感じです。
さらにSAE粘度グレード維持が規定なので、0w-20では5.6cStまでと結構な低下まで許容されるため、どの程度参考になるかは微妙かもしれません。
5304 2018-07-04 15:14:00 The use of oil is OK!
It's the fake war against it that has to stop.
5305 2018-07-04 15:14:00 Oh goodness yes - coconut oil is a hair miracle. Plus an awful lot cheaper than most conditioners.

Cooked some onions and taters in olive oil for breakfast, with some black coffee.

5318 2018-07-04 15:12:42 Peppermint oil and tea tree oil. You gotta make sure you conditioning your hair too after you wash it.
5319 2018-07-04 15:12:40 Why take a pill when you just have the actual oil?? Sounds like a cop out Uncle

5321 2018-07-04 15:12:40 No, being in Europe it doesn’t make sense to order there. I get my vaping stuff from the local headshop - sensiseeds - and order drops from a Dutch company. Royal Queen Seeds made with olive oil. Can’t tolerate hemp oil. And it has indeed calmed my anxiety quite a bit!

5323 2018-07-04 15:12:31 For Bush (or Clinton) to have known about the attacks and done nothing would be comic book level villainy. I think these people love money, and are willing to murder muslims to get oil, but to allow thousands of Americans to die? No, I don't think even Trump would go that far.

5328 2018-07-04 15:11:43 I'll bite here.  Outside of drafting Draymond, Presti did everything possible to sign KD.  No way that's on him.  Presti would have paid Harden.  Ownership was wary of luxury tax.  Remember at time majority owners were staring down federal lawsuit for collusion in oil businesses.
5329 2018-07-04 15:11:42 Naw man, It's too hot outside and it might rain. Plus I need an oil change and get the kids out the house before they drive Mom mad.

5347 2018-07-04 15:10:25 Because there is oil in Venezuela. No humanitarian outreach, just greed.

5360 2018-07-04 15:08:08 All that and more as long as u don't have oil in your backyard 
5361 2018-07-04 15:08:07 It’s hard at first but gets easier and easier. And don’t use salt. Get one of those chain mail scrubbers from amazon. Use very hot water, and always dry well and oil afterwards.

5367 2018-07-04 15:07:40 Poland would rather suck the US's DEEP STATE than purchasing much cheaper gas/oil from Russia. So called the logic of Poland.
5368 2018-07-04 15:07:37 Federalist papers speak directly "to a certain kind of man..." So, there's plenty of this stuff that describes current despots, but nothing new..just a current lame version of Jackson..snake oil, BS!

If they protested OPEC oil they'd be marched off the gangplank in shark infested waters in the Straight of Hormuz
5371 2018-07-04 15:07:03 ... but how else are we going to rescue our oil ???
5372 2018-07-04 15:06:56 Here's another view of BP Outlook. Imo, stat reviews from Oil Cos as well as those from EIA & IAE, have consistently missed data that impacts negatively on their main preoccupation, fossil fuels. Renewables' downward sloping cost curves have been ignored for too long.

5382 2018-07-04 15:05:19 Argan oil. Conditioner with argan oil. I know that keratin infused products dont really make a real difference since our hair is made out of it but i like to use like keratin infused conditioners and hair creams. Once i get home ill snap a pic of the specific products I use!
5383 2018-07-04 15:05:16 Of course, they've got loads of oil to steal.
5384 2018-07-04 15:05:12 Really then why is the price of gas highest in the lower mainland and Van Island if you have all your needs. This is about NGOs being paid to block Canadian oil. Cowards won’t protest oil entering eastern Canada or Alaskan oil daily coming down the coast.
5385 2018-07-04 15:04:36 The Saudis just agreed to increase oil output, why don’t you familiarize yourself a bit more with current events.

5387 2018-07-04 15:04:27 Oil and carbon fuels are not the same thing as fossil fuels. 
Bio fuels can be engineered to be renewable and carbon neutral. They would use exiting infrastructure, making it a win win for everyone

5396 2018-07-04 15:03:50 Trump recently claimed he had gotten the Saudis to agree to increase oil production by 2 million barrels per day.

HE WAS LYING, AS USUAL.

Both the White House and the Saudis have already contradicted Trump's statement.

5400 2018-07-04 15:03:31 Our initial fears north of the International Border that the Red Hats would invade in search of oil (or bacon) have abated; an intercepted communique indicates they believe us buried in snow, despite the summer heatwave. #SecondCivilWarLetters

5407 2018-07-04 15:02:47 Is it not true that Alberta oil is shipped through KinderMorgan to a US refinery that processes it into Jet Fuel that BC then buys back! Why no protests when it’s Alberta oil in US Tankers.Why the hell do Canadians hate anything Canadian!!!

5489 2018-07-04 14:56:14 You are also mixing up policies, the aim is to have an economy that is sufficient without oil, thats been the strategy ive heard about, that way oil is a bonus not a factor like the UK relies on, you should look at why Norway taxes companies differently than the UK,

5491 2018-07-04 14:56:08 There is no oil here bro... the oil industry went bankrupt.
We can't even fill our own cars gastank.

5493 2018-07-04 14:56:04 Girl I swear by bio oil it’s the bomb!!!! Lol expensive but it’s worth it!
5494 2018-07-04 14:55:46 Lol. You realize we’re pushing for a 100% renewable energy future right? That means curbing oil imports and exports. 

We want panels not pipelines, turbines not tankers.

5499 2018-07-04 14:55:18 Just Facts. Israel has:
-occupied the Syrian Golan since 1967 and now Rothschilds (with Cheney and Murdoch and CIA) are profiting from oil there.
-routinely violated Syria airspace and carry out attacks against Syria.
-provided material, medical and air support to ISIS
5500 2018-07-04 14:55:06 I focused on "what we have today". Oil gave us the energy to make tremendous strides. 1776 would be relatively familiar to someone from metropolitan 100 AD whereas 2018 would be baffling.
5501 2018-07-04 14:55:04 Has bedrolite oil been tested for all Cannabinoid? Perhaps cbg/thcv/cbc/terpenes are the key? Bedrolite is a special strain imho- I love it myself... I think it goes beyond a simple thc/cbd ratio though

5521 2018-07-04 14:52:38 Why does oil crash in tandem with stock market crashes? Coz of the perceived fall in demand. Not rocket science. Equities did not fall before Oil in 2007 but at the same time - see peak in S&P. S&P did not truly peak and fall until Sept 2000, just 1 month before oil dumped.

So, what, are we (Canada) next, being the third largest holder of oil in the world? Lucky for us, dimwit Trump doesn't know that.

5630 2018-07-04 14:42:24 When they lose - and they will lose - the RI Democratic party that supports this frivolity should pay damages to both Big Oil, & the state of RI.  And the governor should stop driving, flying, & using electricity immediately.

5650 2018-07-04 14:40:18 Yes. Swinney begged Osborne to slash tax on oil companies, and Osborne obliged. So there is no oil income now. An iScotland would have been in deep doo-doo now. We really dodged a bullet in 2014. And they want us to go through all that again to be in worse shape?

Then oh no my dad’s plan didn’t work so let’s crash some planes and then blame the Middle East, that’ll get everyone on board to go steal their oil
5701 2018-07-04 14:35:00 Jeremy UK oil and gas is not devolved, you must get it into your thick head we don’t manage it, that is why Scotland would follow a different strategy than the UK model. We will need to sort this out once and for all. There is sufficient information on Websites realting to this.

  Who keeps paper receipts in age of cloud?
- $4000 to fix the transmission

The toyota has 190K and no transmission issue

5711 2018-07-04 14:34:39 Kinda kills off OSS. The liability thing. No patching is like not changing oil in your car and expecting 100k miles. Yet forced updates don’t sound bad and would be required if liable. I’m more irritated with the vendor’s FUD and claims to fix all things.

Almost 2 years passed since the presidency of D.Trump afterward he decided to meet his Russian colleague. So what is on their's meeting agenda? Definitely,it is high oil prices on the threshold of forthcoming November elections.
5713 2018-07-04 14:34:23 The US congressional contingency surely looks like the reps from states with the biggest trade in oil, gas, planes, tobacco, etc...... oh wait, let me think, is there a trade issue going on to speak to?

5764 2018-07-04 14:30:30 The oil companies are joint ventures with the Nigerian government as the majority shareholder. They can’t even start a small project without getting it signed off by some sketchy and uninterested characters at NAPIMS.

Blend to required consistency.
5769 2018-07-04 14:29:52 Agree. That's why they care for Venezuela and not, say, Zimbabwe. I have no problem with their interest. They want oil, we want to be free, I'm not expecting them to send American soldiers to die for charity. It's a win-win.

5773 2018-07-04 14:29:44 Want to know why we are at war with Russia in Syria? Our allies Israel want land that’s in between Israel & Syria for oil. They signed over drilling rights for that territory to @GenieEnergy in 2015 after announcing the land had more oil reserves that Saudi Arabia.
5774 2018-07-04 14:29:44 WE must begin Planning processes by setting up Financial incentives for Electric Changing Stations for Vehicles, that Are Powered BY Renewables, so we are not feeding the BEAST of OIL AND GAS ANYMORE....
5775 2018-07-04 14:29:44 Trump is a whore of the first water. He would boil his son Barron in oil if Putin demanded it, in trade for not exposing his crimes.
5776 2018-07-04 14:29:43 ทำไมเหรอครับน้องรัก
5777 2018-07-04 14:29:42 I remember well the last time the US was attacked by foreign forces like would take out our gas and oil power. It was in 1812.
5778 2018-07-04 14:29:41 Hi Len, thank you for getting in contact! Please can you email these images to our care team to investigate?The email is: consumer.care@3vnaturalfoods.com sometimes the natural oil solidifies which can cause the white lumps but it should not make a difference to the taste.Thanks!

5780 2018-07-04 14:29:27 Putin already has what he wants: #WorldCupRussia2018 kudos, gained by corruption. Assad's Syria secured, with the most vile war crimes normalized, Crimea snatch normalized, no one mentions the journalists/critics he's murdered, kleptocracy-dictocracy normalized, oil prices up.
5781 2018-07-04 14:29:21 That's more like phase three. Adam Smith certainly wasn't alive during WW2 and much of our drive "manifest destiny" was there long before the last century. What oil did was add a steroid to an already existing system.
5782 2018-07-04 14:29:18 when you get good enough at fortnite other players have to thank you for your service
5783 2018-07-04 14:29:15 Okay I get it lol just that changing that routine of showering and simply putting lotion and hair oil... You get were im coming from?
5784 2018-07-04 14:29:15 I was driving and this fuel tanker kept trying to overtake me. 

I immediately parked & let it pass when I saw the name on it was 'Rain Oil'.
5785 2018-07-04 14:29:04 No probs! Balms and oils really do help. The oil helped with my dry skin around my beard
5786 2018-07-04 14:28:56 Give him more credit then. At the end of the day the European countries are selling themselves for a bit of oil and money. It is Europe that has helped these vampires to last so long. Stop treating death messengers with dignity they do not deserve. Be on Iranian people's side.

5789 2018-07-04 14:28:47 I sneezed and it smells like synthetic oil, nobody panic but I might be an android
5790 2018-07-04 14:28:41 Still have a few random asshole moths fluttering around the house. One was on my bathroom mirror this morning, so I grabbed the first thing I saw to spray it, which was hair oil. So now my mirror is all blurry and it’s like a soft focus lens and I kinda love it.

5795 2018-07-04 14:28:14 I'm not surprised.  Theres oil to be had there.
5796 2018-07-04 14:28:12 I will rub on some coconut oil in their honor!
5797 2018-07-04 14:28:01 Just make sure you keep going as anything oil based will accelerate the stickiness as it will denature the rubber
5798 2018-07-04 14:27:58 So Roosevelt cut off oil and aluminum to japan hurting their war machine so they had to get resources elsewhere. It was an invite for them to attack US and they did. The rest is history.
5799 2018-07-04 14:27:49 FACT is Canada has been Infrastrucutred to the Addcition of OIL and GAS... and If we go Cold Turkey, Canada will go in TO CIVIL WItH-DRAWN and Put Society into a HAULT.

5801 2018-07-04 14:27:45 If you want to help your pets this 4th of July. Give them hemp oil.  

It’s all natural with no THC and can really ease that anxiety when firework season is underway. 

I have bottles on hand and can meet local people in town today or tomorrow. 

$30/bottle
5802 2018-07-04 14:27:41 Ignorant oil. and fireworks do not mix. Folks get drunk and stop paying attention what kids are doing and, we see Stacey Baca outside a hospital reporting on a preventable accident.

5815 2018-07-04 14:25:42 Dude, ya need to sagen up bout those assertions.. Venezuela has the biggest oil reserves in the world, no  external “block” could ruin that up. Although far from perfect and required from improvements, capitalism is by far the better option, and THAT my friend is a fact.
5816 2018-07-04 14:25:40 That's because of the MCT oil.
5817 2018-07-04 14:25:38 really thick layer of vaseline
also, coconut oil
5818 2018-07-04 14:25:36 "common interests around the world".... oil, those exxon oil fields they can't pump until santions are lifted, our fake elections... yes, so much common interest.
5819 2018-07-04 14:25:35 Someone deliver a paddling pool  tae my garden pls can pay u half a packet of cool original Doritos and a bottle of baby oil
5820 2018-07-04 14:25:21 The new civil war will commence after Trump is off another golfcation. Sadly. He has singlehandedly taken a fairly civil country backwards and his mouth still runneth over. Civility appears to be done for, unless??  I'm bringing the Penne a la Broccoli,  Garlic and Olive Oil.
5821 2018-07-04 14:25:19 The most exciting thing was discovering the oil rig, and landing an island. Do you have plans to make larger more explorable land based content? Whether it be islands, abandoned boats and oil rigs etc the discovery and the looting is awesome.

5824 2018-07-04 14:24:52 If he was put back with McD would he have been traded?  Even if he was traded it would have at least boosted his trade value. Very strange how the Oil always choose to handle players and trade low
5825 2018-07-04 14:24:52 I keep getting oil on my fackin clothes :-)

5829 2018-07-04 14:24:34 Railways, a common way to transport coal, have been bombed. Coal storage is not exactly inflammable. Coal generating stations are similar targets to gas and oil ones. All energy systems have risks. His staff is failing him.
5830 2018-07-04 14:24:33 Those ropes suspending your useless weight from the bridge are made of nylon. Your equipment and clothing all made from oil.
#PeakHypocricy
5831 2018-07-04 14:24:27 This is going to cost us tax payers billions of dollars lost. Goodbye transfer payments from the Feds, hello expensive law suits from the companies that paid for their carbon credits. Big oil wins in this scenario. 1/2
5832 2018-07-04 14:24:24 My dearest WV,
# I am headed into battle against the Redhats. The corruption smells from  Charleston to The Greenbrier. Fear not with vote in hand we can send the Redhats back to Trumpworld where they will see Trump for what he is. A snake oil salesmen. #SecondCivilWarLetters
5833 2018-07-04 14:24:22 You might be right! However I think strides are being made in UK to change our inadvertent destructive behaviour. Single use plastic bag tax, new bottle recycling initiatives. Move away from palm oil usage. Remove plastic straws. Focus on vegetarian food options. Progress 
5834 2018-07-04 14:24:17 "Christ" means "the anointed one." Anointed by the Holy oil. Baptised by the Holy oil. The gift that Jesus died for was not just spiritual, he left us the gift of good health. He took it from the priests and gave it to the common man. That was illegal.
5835 2018-07-04 14:24:14 Follow the Senators who went and what states they represent and the possible future oil pipeline. Paints a picture that's for sure.
5836 2018-07-04 14:24:08 Breaking: not all Iranians are bad people. Hell, most Iranians are probably just trying to make a living, just like anyone else.

You know HOW & WHY Iran has the leadership it does? #history #EducationMatters Hint: the US helped overthrow Iranian democracy for their oil. 8/19/53
5837 2018-07-04 14:24:00 But I thought you wanted to abandon oil & gas. How would we extract the resources, with wind and solar powered heavy machinery?
5838 2018-07-04 14:23:59 #NOGConference2018Day2. 
We're supporting efforts at driving sustainable development in the nation's oil and gas industry.
5839 2018-07-04 14:23:58 Then the gathered chorus sings the words: "They is dumb, gunner son, from the leaks, from the heels, from the sky,
oil is well, safely west . . ." Sigh. What can we expect? Private Covfefe & singers studied at #CadetBoneSpurs's School for the #StableGenius. Or is it genious?
5840 2018-07-04 14:23:55 Something is definitely wrong with me why the fuck don’t I tan even with tanning injections or oil and smashing the sunbeds or even abroad I just stay white every single person I’ve seen is brown as fuck an I would give Casper a run for his cloak. 
5841 2018-07-04 14:23:52 Yeahhh...  Well I don't have a beef with Palm oil. It's raw onions. Miss me with that. 
5842 2018-07-04 14:23:43 จ้าาาาาาา อิอิ
5843 2018-07-04 14:23:43 Seaweed or hemp plastic anyone...both compostable.. Hemp can help produce nano electric(future) and oil/Bio-mass(present) for energy whilst taking co2 from atmosphere, feeding the soil all localy grown,local economy,  by products incl animal feed,food,milk etc
5844 2018-07-04 14:23:39 In addition to hemp oil, I also recommend Bach’s Rescue remedy by mouth, and buy the pheromone spray stuff and spray a Bandana with it for them to wear.
5845 2018-07-04 14:23:28 極端な粘度低下は問題ですが仕様内の粘度低下が長期的な耐久性にどの程度影響していくかは判断が難しい所で。もちろんサーキットを走るなどととなると別ですが。一応トヨタ側は計400万キロ以上の走り込みで作ったと言っていますので、それをどう判断するかですね。基本的な劣化に対しては強いかと。
5846 2018-07-04 14:23:24 What. The. Actual. Fork. Whyyyyy??? What could they have that we could possible want? Oh wait. Oil reserves. Ok yeah this makes sense now.

5849 2018-07-04 14:22:56 I don't see the elections taking place in December, especially after the recent violence in Derna & the Oil Installation Crescent & #Haftar's unilateral move to hand over the facilities there to the unrecognised rival East-NOC #Libya.

5885 2018-07-04 14:18:41 The #carbontax adds to the price of gas.  BTW, calling Alberta's energy industry "Big Oil" will not help get private sector investment back in AB.  A prosperous AB needs a profitable energy industry.
5886 2018-07-04 14:18:37 Trump LOVES dictators! So why is Maduro different? It's the OIL! OIL! OIL!
5887 2018-07-04 14:18:29 Okay @RealAlexJones where is the Civil War that @TheDemocrats are supposed to start on #4thofJuly 

What's sad is his followers will still buy his snake oil.
5888 2018-07-04 14:18:13 Especially when in cosmos (outside Earth) corporations will send data  about oil or other resources on other planets or places. It's already  possible to send messages very fast from one galaxy to other using the  neutrino particles, but can you decrypt them…
5889 2018-07-04 14:18:12 とりあえず突撃しますね()
5890 2018-07-04 14:17:55 Also in 1953 we toppled the democratically elected leader of Iran through a coup and propped up an extremist Muslim leader in his place so we and the UK could have cheap oil.
5891 2018-07-04 14:17:54 Ima just warn y’all if you have a vehicle, never go to spedee for a oil change they gone fuck yo shit up.. 
5892 2018-07-04 14:17:45 #onpoli had cap & trade. A successful program partnered with California and QC. It adds about 3c to pump prices. Which have risen MOSTLY because of oil barrel going from $49 a yr a go to $70. And your hero Trump fuckin up Iran nuke deal. Go back to waitering and lying about menus
5893 2018-07-04 14:17:44 Solar panels produce electricity.

Oil, in America, is less than 1% of our grid.

Solar and oil don't really compete with each other.

5897 2018-07-04 14:17:22 Canadian oil prices are poised to continue their slow, steady march upward next year as shipping bottlenecks ease and U.S. refiners look north to fill the gap created by decreasing output from Venezuela. #oott
5898 2018-07-04 14:17:13 It probably is something that could have been worked on all of these years instead of just figuring out how to build better bombs.  But we let the oil companies control the discourse, and now we will reap what we sow.

5907 2018-07-04 14:15:48 we need to move on , OIl and GAS is a technology of the Past,  No disrespect, but This Addiction of Using Dead animals to power our Death machines for transportation needs to END.
5908 2018-07-04 14:15:45 Pool partyyyyy

They use to be full of alcohol, baby oil & country music now they’re full of SPF 50, boobie milk & country music  

The country music hasn’t change but the company has and I can’t say I’m hating it one bit 

Bring on baby pool day

5911 2018-07-04 14:15:06 When the Lord Sri Krishna Kesava was born in Tirukkottiyur of beautiful mansions they spilled oil and turmeric powder on one another, slushing the portico of Krishna’s house.
5912 2018-07-04 14:15:01 I’ve definitely grown to love oil paint more than acrylic and I never thought that would happen ...
5913 2018-07-04 14:14:59 just remembered..was he not publicly offering 15k to me if showed just 1 trade..maybe that's why he disappeared now that he has to pony up:) #OOTT
5914 2018-07-04 14:14:58 WHAT IN HELL GIVES TRUMP THE IDEA THAT HE CAN SEND THE ARMY INTO VENEZUELA AND REMOVE AN ELECTED OFFICIAL FROM ITS GOVERNMENT, TIME TO GET RID OF TRUMP AND THE CIA, THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT RULE THE WORLD. THEY WANT TO STEAL THE OIL FROM VENEZUELA
5915 2018-07-04 14:14:57 Well, this is appropriate for American Independence Day. January, 20 2017. The day America LOST its independence, maybe forever, to a snake oil salesman and world class liar

5919 2018-07-04 14:14:33 The greenpalm doesn't mean the product contain durable palm oil just some money goes to durable palm oil production.
The point is here (France, Belgium) something vegan doesn't contain palm oil in any way.
I'm sending you this kindly so you know it it could cost your brand images

5921 2018-07-04 14:14:19 Η MOtor Oil έκλεισε στα 17,96 ευρώ με άνοδο 2,63% όγκο 145 χιλ. τεμάχια και αποτίμηση 1,98 δισ. ευρώ
5922 2018-07-04 14:14:07 一時期毎日のように食ってたからうれしいな　ベーコンに理由付けて値上げは悲しいけど
5923 2018-07-04 14:13:55 That bucket tipped over a long time ago. Why is he still there? Answers please. Must have something to do with domestic oil or gas and destroying the environment
5924 2018-07-04 14:13:42 Really, 'Golden Emu Oil' very good. Used for years, absolutely no links with company :))
5925 2018-07-04 14:13:36 I see their artery to be his plastered down pit more than its olive oil on his wind
5926 2018-07-04 14:13:33 That's more money for the oil company to spend,will the oil wellsever run dry???
5927 2018-07-04 14:13:23 Personally I'm not sure either way BUT say lithium is the big story, I don't want to miss out. I also have exposure to copper, nickel, graphene, graphite, cobalt, oil and gold.
5928 2018-07-04 14:13:16 I told my mom about how shaving with olive oil makes your skin feel better than ANY other method.. now my whole family is on the wave 
5929 2018-07-04 14:13:13 Nuts! Completely bonkers! 
Invading Venezuela makes now sense, pro or against Trump.

US doesn't even need Venezuela's oil, if that could be construed as evil justification.
Trump likes dictators, why not Maduro?
And how would invading Venezuela 'make America great again'?
5930 2018-07-04 14:13:13 Fire needs more oil
5931 2018-07-04 14:13:13 マックポーク復活してたのか！
5932 2018-07-04 14:13:12 Why can't they camp them at home. I am just wondering why they need all these people to leave their homes? It's either GOLD, OIL or valuable resources... And they need the people out of the way so they can extract it...  Perhaps that's is why?
5933 2018-07-04 14:13:11 Watching an Australian video about how to oil a deck and the guy is just 100% saying dick
5934 2018-07-04 14:13:07 I should look into CBD oil. I never thought about that.
5935 2018-07-04 14:13:02 Dudes expect you to cook & do womanly duties but don’t even know how to change my oil or add Freon to my car 
5936 2018-07-04 14:12:47 Just got back from Whole Foods. They’re almost out of pre-skewered chicken. Supplies are DIRE. Send word we need more olive oil.  #SecondCivilWar
5937 2018-07-04 14:12:45 ....  "I haz a sad".... I'm collecting all of your best stuff to plagiarize later. ... waiting for you to top 'slaphappy harlot'.
5938 2018-07-04 14:12:34 The dealership & the warranty company are asking
- All paper-work of all oil changes/maintenance etc
  (AKA excuse not to honor warranty)
  Who keeps paper receipts in age of cloud?
- $4000 to fix the transmission

The toyota has 190K and no transmission issue
5939 2018-07-04 14:12:06 We give them CBD oil and it works like a charm. Last year we gave them Benadryl. Thank god they cancelled the firework show at the HS again this year.
5940 2018-07-04 14:12:01 ... Will the essential oil just "use up" some of the smell absorption power of the baking soda?
5941 2018-07-04 14:12:01 No problem. Canada is your current number one buyer of American goods. In fact we imported more U.S. products than China, Japan, Mexico and Europe did - COMBINED. (500 billion per year not inc oil or lumber - for now)

So say good bye to those jobs and products, permanently.
5942 2018-07-04 14:11:51 The 70 year old infant in the white house, wants to feel the rush of war...all for the purpose of stealing the OIL from Venezuela:

Chasing the idea of WHITE glory...which means taking what rightfully belongs to brown people. 

The idiot is making enemies at the back & front door
5943 2018-07-04 14:11:47 If Venezuela didn’t have huge oil deposits & other natural resources to plunder, he wouldn’t have ever considered doing anything. Totally predictable for a despot. How about ‘invading’ Puerto Rico & doing an “Infrastructure Stand Down” to fix our own Country? How about that?
5944 2018-07-04 14:11:25 Dear Grandma,

I boiled the meat in its juices, like you taught me and added stockfish & smoked fish.

The aroma? Heavenly.

I'm making Afang soup with fufu. Mama brought me fresh, sweet palm oil.

Later, I'll post a pic on IG to cause longer-throat.

I miss you.

Love,

Kokomma.
5945 2018-07-04 14:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza today will be: chewy crust with moist coconut oil and Italian sausage.

5950 2018-07-04 14:10:21 I did a deep conditioner & a hot oil treatment on my hair then blew it out & flat ironed it. My hair came out like a wig!
5951 2018-07-04 14:10:16 夏とかTシャツに油のシミできるよねえ。あれ透けるからほぼ全裸みたいになるよ僕。
5952 2018-07-04 14:10:05 Depends on the texture of your hair. Coconut oil, jojoba oil, Shea butter. Depends on your budget too. They can be pretty pricey.
5953 2018-07-04 14:10:02 You'd feel heat from the firebox, smell hot steam and oil; you'd hear the whistle, feel the ground vibrate, and watch as one-ton drive ...
5954 2018-07-04 14:09:56 Follow the oil and gas pipelines
5955 2018-07-04 14:09:50 I put oil on my whole body and now I feel like a porn star
5956 2018-07-04 14:09:39 Although I am behind every single person who gives service to their country, we have had wars that were not about freedom but about oil and we should as a country be ashamed of sending our soldiers to oil wars.
5957 2018-07-04 14:09:39 We should have taken Iran's oil. We could lower the gas prices and help save money for our crunchy roll subscriptions.
5958 2018-07-04 14:09:31 Economics and Socialism are like oil and water. They don't mix well. But good luck with that.

5962 2018-07-04 14:09:22 But we already have several swords (2 of them sword-canes) 2 double rubber-band guns, one trebuchet and a hand catapult ready! Plus a bag of feathers - we're working on the tar - a large barrel of used brake oil, and a large kettle to boil it.

因みにエンジンルームとかも見させてはいけませんよ！勝手に色々と不安を煽ってOIL交換をしたほうが良いとか、ラジエーター液の補充したほうが良いとか、バッテリー交換した方が良いとか、色々と言って何とか買わせようとするからね(笑)
5965 2018-07-04 14:09:01 C’est un peu tendu : peak oil conventionnel en 2006, perte de la biodiversité, climat, surpopulation mondiale, mur des ressources, mur énergétique, déforestation et économies effondrées dans des régions instables...
Heu, je ne sais pas ce qu’il faut en plus ?
5966 2018-07-04 14:09:01 Hi, I'm Mike. I engage in utter hypocrisy and virtue signalling. I rage a relentless and irrational campaign against reality. In fact, without oil products, I'd be totally naked and have no tether to showcase my ignorance.
5967 2018-07-04 14:09:00 During oil boom Nigeria was better & now that Oil fall you want @MBuhari to do magic Avi, today you sum up your whole tweet against PMB in one sentence.
5968 2018-07-04 14:09:00 i still can’t believe i didn’t get any! cocoa butter and vitamin e oil work great, but every girl is different and some just get more stretch marks than others! it’s all worth it in the end

5971 2018-07-04 14:08:29 I saw they have CBD oil online but not in local stores. I'll have to work up an order here soon! For today I may have to rely on Benadryl for the dogs though...
5972 2018-07-04 14:08:27 Guess who spilled oil all over himself making fries....
 
Oily... Impromptu Bath...
5973 2018-07-04 14:08:25 Well his intention is to build three refineries, return Mexico to oil economics and in a recent visit to Sonora he rammed against Eolic energy.... Just so you know
5974 2018-07-04 14:08:24 ไม่ดีกว่า ขอก้าวไม่ทันต่อไป
5975 2018-07-04 14:08:10 I heard their service centers have even skipped doing oil changes
5976 2018-07-04 14:08:03 My one week old Bantu knots all shrunken, this allows me to style my hair in different ways and puff my hair up...  
I have been moisturizing with water only and today is when I put some coconut oil.
5977 2018-07-04 14:07:58 More like oil and WWII.
5978 2018-07-04 14:07:55 Oil is the way! 
5979 2018-07-04 14:07:53 Yeah, they can do that. For me lang kasi parang may bias ang 4Ps since pinipili yung beneficiary, unlike pag subsidized ang oil, everyone will benefit.
And yeah, a simple suggestion box is a good way for them to hear what we think. Individually ata meron per agency or office

5982 2018-07-04 14:07:19 He wants the oil of course!
5983 2018-07-04 14:07:09 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.

5988 2018-07-04 14:06:30 In order to ship our oil overseas? Then we still have to import from Saudi Barbaria

5992 2018-07-04 14:06:18 being American  is overstating the imperialistic nature of America and how capitalism is bad while eat 50 hot dogs made in Bangladesh, sippin oil from Nigeria and tweetin platitudes from that slick iPhoneX  hey NSA!
5993 2018-07-04 14:05:47 But i need cheap oil for my truck
5994 2018-07-04 14:05:35 I cringe every time I hear that word now.  The more I learn about them, the more I hate them.  Tee Tree oil can cause neurological issues in dogs and it can straight up kill birds.  It makes you wonder what it is doing to us.
5995 2018-07-04 14:05:14 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
5996 2018-07-04 14:05:01 This venezuela news is bonkers. Venezuela added to the travel ban is such an outlier and was vastly underscrutinized. Btw, they have a lot of oil.

6003 2018-07-04 14:04:09 How do you get around ? Your whole organization runs on oil 
6004 2018-07-04 14:04:07 I know, but they are soft, chewy and have just the right ginger flavor.  Maybe Amazon is sneaking in preservatives, partially hydrogenated palm oil, high fructose corn syrup and GMOs when the vegan bakers are not looking?

6008 2018-07-04 14:03:09 So RI is basically saying I’m going to sue you Big Oil for providing a fuel critical to our survival because we think our citizens consume too much of what you provide to survive.
6009 2018-07-04 14:03:05 I'm so worried.

6015 2018-07-04 14:02:21 Semantics? You called AB oil "the dirtiest shit on the planet" and you were full of it.
Refining has benefits, yes, but you just CANNOT ship gasoline to China by tanker, can you?
Nice deflection attempt with that idiotic "feminist" comment.

6018 2018-07-04 14:01:53 They only keep producing gas and oil because the public demands it. 
      Answer: Get cars off the road. 
They only keep fracking because the public demands natural gas to heat our homes. 
      Answer: Higher density housing.

6021 2018-07-04 14:01:16 Exacto, en si la suba esa se debe más al aumento salarial que lo tienen cada 6 meses. Generalmente lo suben 1 o 2 pesos, pero si el gas oil sube (que en este caso no subió) se va a 3 o 4 pesos más el boleto

What's wrong with continuing a successful union and sharing/using that to help others globally?
6039 2018-07-04 13:59:39 @FFAW_Unifor has zero credibility in holding offshore oil and gas to account until union reveals amount of cash the industry pumps into its bank account. Been over a year since FISH-NL questioned whether FFAW bought and paid for—conflicts of interest rampant. @nlpoli

6042 2018-07-04 13:58:50 I agree but most likely that's what is going to happen, this is their game. Destroy a country then lend money to said country for reconstruction, they did the same thing with Iraq. 
Syrias oil is not enough to cover the cost, not enough oil and they don't own 100% of it either.

6046 2018-07-04 13:58:18 Mr Rothkopf, you wrote what I thought!!! The man has been a buffoon for decades, his ignorance is stunning and an ebarrassment (and not just about coal & oil!). Being president amplifies this, to America’s shame. The world is laughing and cringing in equal measure.

6053 2018-07-04 13:57:33 Even the thought of invading Venezuela is a disastrous.  Trump wants to displace one dictator with another [himself].  Sending young men and women to war to die or become injured for the goal of securing oil is ridiculous.

Send Eric & Don Jr first.
6054 2018-07-04 13:57:30 take Indian Point out and natgas and "dual fuel" (oil/gas) pick up that slack.

Then New York's CO2 goes further through the roof, and they start breaking their NOx bank by mid-year instead of close to year end like 2017.

The idea that wind can save them... well see the chart

6057 2018-07-04 13:57:20 On the contrary, uncle sam should "arrange" a referendum in Venezuela for merge into united states. Most of the Venezuelan will vote for it for the sake of becoming American citizen. Thats the cheapest, legal & most non violent way to exploit Venezuelan oil.

6079 2018-07-04 13:53:32 They're good at the secret stuff - Scotland lost 6,000 square miles of marine territory overnight as Devolution took centre stage.
Why move the border anyway? - but they did.
It just so happened that 7 highly productive oil fields were within that area - just a coincidence, eh?
6080 2018-07-04 13:53:28 North Dakota's citizens should be calling or visiting @SenJohnHoeven to ask, why the hell are you in Russia with six others? Is it about ag issues? Oil? Or something they would rather you not know? Give him a call.
6081 2018-07-04 13:53:27 One that is making money on the backs of hard working Americans. One that cuts a deal with Saudi Arabia to force crude oil to $80 a barrel; then a fake tweet telling them to increase production.
6082 2018-07-04 13:53:27 Yes! Sadly today they fight for Big oil n the Rothchild'$ banking system. Why invade Iraq on a "humanitarian" effort n NOT Central America? ...no oil, poppy fields n they already under the banking system.

6091 2018-07-04 13:52:07 Oil Is manipulated by large Investors. It has nothing to do with supply and demand. We are OVERSUPPLIED with oil and have been for a LONG time. #USA Is producing record amounts yet oil just keeps going higher. It's a joke.,

6096 2018-07-04 13:51:54 I work for an Oil and Gas producer. We’ve hammered Billions back into the economy since 2014. CEE $ is the only thing I can think of for subsidies, and that rounds to Zero. 

What are the subsidies? 

Meanwhile, 40% of the price of Gasoline is taxed. Natural gas around 100%.

NA "dirtiest oil" comes from California.
Never mind Nigeria. 
Heavy oil, like bitumen, is a preferred choice because it gives refiners a wider array of products.
50% of US imports are heavy oil while they export a lot of light. Can you guess why?

6179 2018-07-04 13:41:41 One suggestion? Why not cancel the 4Ps project na alam naman nating dinadaya rin naman ng mga nasa barangays. Then transfer the funds to DOE and subsidies the oil importation. It will negate the burden of the excise tax on oil

6354 2018-07-04 13:23:20 It's 35C here today so naturally I'm running the math to see if upgrading my HVAC system to a heat pump makes sense. I'd stand to save about $600/year in fuel costs, plus I'd vastly reduce my carbon footprint by giving up oil. Tempting.
6355 2018-07-04 13:23:13 Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly Oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off buildings. Please tell @YEGPride @vancouverpride how you justify obstructing Gay friendly oil to favour #bloodoil ?

6378 2018-07-04 13:20:22 I use soap, I just don’t leave it to soak or anything, and it’s fine.  Wipe it down with oil and a paper towel afterwards to keep it sealed from rust. Everyone’s a big fucking baby about their precious seasoning.

6398 2018-07-04 13:18:31 You are such a Debbie Downer on this. I am sure the summit meeting will be as successful as the deal reached with NK. We will be at war in Middle East before election. They all want a piece of Iraq'a oil. Nitwityahoo wants some too.
6399 2018-07-04 13:18:30 2/3rd of the oil pumped goes to Russia and China for debt. God knows what they put as a value on it. Suspect China $5b loan receives $7b in oil at market price. It also needs Venezuela for its overall OBOR initiative

6402 2018-07-04 13:18:11 Reason for current account deficit in India is crude oil. You know what is second most imported?? Electronics. Either export more domestic products or import less foreign. To export, we need more spaces like #walmartindia #ikeaindia
6403 2018-07-04 13:18:01 Yes, J and Kim also made huge impact in hiphop but their bags stopped since mid of 2000s. Nicki debut was 2008 and after that, most of rap solo songs back to charts on top10 bb   and nicki been winning eight years consistently, at least respect it

6415 2018-07-04 13:16:06 What does that even mean? We can't afford ANOTHER military misadventure. And what would be the military objective? Control, in some form, of Venezuelan oil? How much will that cost? Screw Susan Sarandon. You should have voted for Hillary Clinton. RESISTANCE

6417 2018-07-04 13:15:40 Misleading lede!

6459 2018-07-04 13:11:17 His point that we would need to harvest lumber if the coal got rained on and the oil all got bombed was wait did I hit my head on a hard metal object?
6460 2018-07-04 13:10:48 Hmmm how is water filtered? Water treatment plants are made using sunlight? Ride a bike do you? Wear a jacket? How is that made? You make it out of sunlight? Did you carve it out of wood with your teeth? Enjoy your oil products for the next 100+ years and shut up

6465 2018-07-04 13:10:31 Not at all. My point is that Obama’s defences of the environment were quite modest. Following the Gulf Oil spill he put in some modest regulations which Trump reversed. He did very little on carbon abatement.

6469 2018-07-04 13:10:00 The usual paranoid exageration. If the situation is so dire as you say why do you and the rest of your zealots continue using products made from oil? Live by example, show us how committed you are and eschew any benefit you receive from oil. Bet you can't.
6470 2018-07-04 13:09:54 Besides, most of the so called “subsidies” that the oil industry gets aren’t subsidies at all. Simply tax breaks afforded most companies. 2 of the 3 companies in this country that pay the most taxes are oil companies.
6471 2018-07-04 13:09:23 Restoring democracy is a bullshit narrative, the US just wants to overthrow Venezuela for oil, just like every other country ever.

6477 2018-07-04 13:08:17 Not true. Without subsidies oil companies would be forced to charge closer to the world average which is about $8 per gallon. They would still make the same amount of money, it would just kill poor and lower class Americans.

6479 2018-07-04 13:08:12 According to @PWEmagazine1, 40% of all pump and rotating equipment malfunctions are caused by bearing failures. Of those failures, almost 50% are the result of contaminated lubrication oil. 

By using self-lubricating materials like carbon graphite, you can AVOID them altogether.

6507 2018-07-04 13:04:34 You should absolutely back what you believe in. I too want vibrant American industry and a reduction in dependence on foreign oil. I'm just asking you to look closely at the man who's claiming to carry your banner. There are plenty of red flags.

6536 2018-07-04 13:00:45 Except in typical dumb EFF style they totally ignore reality...the oil price is up all over the world not just SA. Part of the reason is Trump canning the Iran deal. Since SA imports most of it's oil it has the same fluctuations as the world market.

¿Hacia adónde apuntará el tipo de cambio el día de hoy?, ¿cuánto le estará influenciando el factor político?
Excelente día.

6618 2018-07-04 12:53:03 Además, si uno busca yo que sé, "olive oil", si no hubiera el bias contra publicar estudios negativos que suele haber una buena parte de los estudios debería de arrojar resultados negativos. Por suerte ese bias no existe para publicar resultados nulos sobre estos temas.
6619 2018-07-04 12:53:01 That's very true. But as adults we should all be at the point in life were we know everything isn't for everyone and to take any routines with a grain of salt. Have you had a bad experience with coconut oil? Or you've seen others go through it?

6621 2018-07-04 12:52:50 President Rouhani of Iran in Switzerland, in a gathering of Iranians there, have said if the US was to stop Iran from exporting its oil then no one in the region will export either. Iranian government says this "threat" is misinterpreted. Really? Is he so uneducated?

6628 2018-07-04 12:52:21 Go Arnie - but let's not forget that Coal is not the only dinosaur industry that is polluting the world and creating huge problems for future generations.  We need to create faster change away from Oil too, build longer lasting vehicles which run on clean fuel.

6658 2018-07-04 12:48:15 @cathmckenna @JustinTrudeau of course they are not doing that in the US. The US wouldn't allow it under Obama or Trump or any President. They would be in jail. In the meantime, the US continues to be gifted Canadian oil so they can profit and Canada doesn't.

Don’t pour oil into the fire of anti-Islamism. You shud be aware of the history of Holocaust. It was not a one off thing emanating from the skewed brain of one Hitler. Anti-Semitism was widespread in the western world. It just so happened that Hitler acted

6677 2018-07-04 12:45:31 IMHO this is an attempt at tax-by-lawsuit. RI wins money, maybe an ongoing settlement. Oil co's pass along the costs. A Carbon Tax without messy legislation.

6681 2018-07-04 12:44:35 yeah i use sweet almond oil, all oils aren’t alike.
6682 2018-07-04 12:44:20 Lived in Washington county . The oil and gas industry rolled in like a steam roller. We still do not know all the consequences of tracking and most have swallowed the kool- aid. The industry has thrown tons of money at people and most have taken it ,but at what cost ?
6683 2018-07-04 12:44:07 Scandals intensify, the poor get poorer, big oil and CEO's get richer, our environment gets more toxic. Yay Trump
6684 2018-07-04 12:44:06 I wonder how many messages they had to test before discovering that one would stick for some reason. "Uh, what about oil pirates?" "What about molerats?" "Meteors?"
6685 2018-07-04 12:44:02 That whole “you can’t advocate for a more sustainable world while using petroleum products” argument is stupid. If I think the edu system could do better, should I pull my kids out of school completely or keep sending them while petitioning for change? Nobody is saying ZERO oil.
6686 2018-07-04 12:43:45 Oil works great for me. I use oil on my face every day and my skin is flourishing. I used to use coconut oil, but I like the feel of evoo better. Sweet almond oil, grapeseed oil, and sesame oil are all great options too.
6687 2018-07-04 12:43:41 Part of syrian problems started also because of booming demography which was unsutainable in not developing fast enough economy. As long as there was plenty of oil it was ok, but where share per citizen fallen - social unreast was inevitable - the same reason created Arab Spring.
6688 2018-07-04 12:43:41 I never check the weather I just see if my coconut oil has melted to see how hot it is 
6689 2018-07-04 12:43:37 Lol and i decided to not go ahead since what i was gonna say is evil, and we all know heaven and evil deeds oil and water so yea
6690 2018-07-04 12:43:37 I use Witch Hazel and vitamin E oil, my skin has gotten much better. It might not work for everyone but maybe try it out?
6691 2018-07-04 12:43:34 With the high income from oil, amount borrowed and savings depleted under PDP, Abuja metro line should have been completed long ago. Talk of wasted opportunity that can never be regained. By now we should be spending time & resources on other projects, not on abandoned projects

6701 2018-07-04 12:42:27 Believe oil tanker hype was a little premature. First tanker was acid wash, second was water, third was waste tanker.  The next will be oil. Likely to be in next day or two after on-site tanks are filled #UKOG #HH #GatwickGusher #DOR #alba #solo

- The government still has not declassified yet, but will establish a commission to begin process.

6728 2018-07-04 12:38:39 Was more a comment on some of the outfits who are/could be involved. I know people who already take CBD oil and have seen the benefits, as well as someone who sells it - I’ve no doubt it the medical benefits and agree it needs to be legalised to enable stronger doses
6729 2018-07-04 12:38:38 Salt sugar and oil. Stuff that help recover when one is starving. World War time food research.

6731 2018-07-04 12:38:27 what kind of sapphic are you: an oil pastel, graphite, or pastel sapphic? an Alice in Wonderland sapphic or a Bambi sapphic?
6732 2018-07-04 12:38:19 I hope they help! Ozzie takes CBD oil daily for his cancer/chemo side effects, but I’m also spiking the water dish with Bach’s Rescue Remedy. Thankfully my new neighborhood doesn’t shoot off fireworks all week like LA, but we’re less than a mile from a professional show.

6736 2018-07-04 12:37:54 the bus services in the UK are in many parts none existent-privatisation again! ruined a once great service-thatchers sell sell sell ideology as ruined the UK-someone needs to be pulled over hot coals boiled in oil and hung drawn and quartered for what has been done to UK people
6737 2018-07-04 12:37:54 i came to the dealer for an oil change and i think i convinced myself i’m going to trade in my car
6738 2018-07-04 12:37:51 We now have an EPA leader who cares more about big oil profits than the environment. There need to be consequences for our betrayal.

#Oil
6743 2018-07-04 12:36:19 What a simple minded person. How do you feel your military? Coal? No. Wood? No. Fact is, oil powers the military. You blow up an oil pipeline or refinery or tankers or storage facility ... Anyway. The military comes to a grinding halt. Here's your security reason.
6744 2018-07-04 12:36:17 If Churchill followed Trump’s reasoning he would have never changed the British fleet from coal to oil immediately before Workd War 1
6745 2018-07-04 12:36:16 Amy, it is a story, Trump will lift sanctions on Oil. Remember the stalled $500 Billion Exxon project, follow the money , Trumps action will not be for free.
6746 2018-07-04 12:35:59 Who said that..........? Is the gate hinge squeaking????
@RichieFirth, stick some oil on it mate, ta muchly!

6751 2018-07-04 12:35:17 You’ve asked more logical questions in one tweet than he’s ever contemplated over the course of his huckster, snake oil shilling life.
6752 2018-07-04 12:35:10 Sometimes you do more by sleeping than by burning the midnight oil.
6753 2018-07-04 12:35:00 Okay, remember that olive oil and ice cream challenge back in 20idon'tcare? 

#SaveShadowhunters #NotOurLastHunt turns out they sell that flavor too!! line up people.
6754 2018-07-04 12:34:44 Yeah, that checks out. What's a little war crime and bloodletting if you get oil and red meat for the "base" in exchange? I reckon the venom he spewed against W was because W's investment in bringing down Sadam didn't pay off.
6755 2018-07-04 12:34:16 Rain exposure is definitely a weakness of oil
6756 2018-07-04 12:34:11 I agree with your assessment of the Soviets. the Pacific theatre could not have been won without the US, I’ll grant you that, but I doubt you could have taken the European theatre alone. maybe, as you say, at huge cost. it is good that we didn’t need to find out, however

6758 2018-07-04 12:33:50 You mean a country that economically relies on oil for it's export and would boost the profits of Russian and Middle Eastern 'allies?'
6759 2018-07-04 12:33:47 Wants their oil.  Also, Putin benefits from sanctions on Venezuelan oil.
6760 2018-07-04 12:33:43 Father,
  We have captured the Strategic Hair Oil supply of the Red Hats. This was thanks to unexpected reinforcements comprised of survivors of the Swedish terror attacks and their company of battle trolls. I hope to be home for the War on Christmas. #secondcivilwarletters
6761 2018-07-04 12:33:37 TSLA yes already Oil soon.
6762 2018-07-04 12:33:22 The market is adulterated by the money from oil dictatorships.

But look at Real Madrid - Juventus - Ronaldo and the €100M that Juventus will pay to sign Ronaldo. That's a realistic negotiation between true football teams.

6767 2018-07-04 12:32:46 Someone gave him the talking point to be pro-coal because 'national security' and he remembers 'bombing ISIS oil', and in his head he puts 2 and 2 together and gets 8/11 and talks about the 'indestructibility' of coal. How on earth can this man be allowed to continue as leader.

6769 2018-07-04 12:32:16 any scene with cheddar, also the full bullpen... reminds me of when I tried to slide across the entire kitchen using oil and broke the coffee machine...
6770 2018-07-04 12:32:07 @FLM_SA I bought what was labeled as lean mince today at your Berea branch and the amount of oil that came out after cooking was unbelievable, especially considering that I used no oil. Three entire packets. Njani na guys?
6771 2018-07-04 12:32:06 Hello Twitter, I have chronic neck and shoulder pains and no therapies have worked. Looking at CBD relief, but no idea where to start. Can I buy an oil and mix it with a daily cream I already use or do I have to make my own cream/oil?

6773 2018-07-04 12:31:53 Darling,

6775 2018-07-04 12:31:50 The West, namely, Europeans want an immigration guard, an oil guard and a guard against terrorism, but do not want a state with a sovereign decision. The Libyans have turned things from their hands so hard to deal with them. This is the reality today

6778 2018-07-04 12:31:17 You proved your ignorance by spewing Greenpeace propaganda. “TAR” is a product of oil which you can’t ship as it would harden like the highway you drive on. You do drive right.
6779 2018-07-04 12:30:59 AND what does Putin's Russia have to offer the USA. Putin will not change Ukraine or Crimean policies. He will not pressure Assad. China holds the cards for NK. There is nothing to gain as a nation.There is personal gain for Trump and his family and businesses. Even without oil$$

6787 2018-07-04 12:30:24 This statement is meaningless. Dems stand for individual rights, an effective government that serves the people. trump Republicans stand for the rich and powerful. With Republicans in control, we will soon look like Russia, an aging, oligarchy that produces nothing but oil.
6788 2018-07-04 12:30:19 ..back during “shock and awe” days they pushed the line that it wasn’t about the oil.. but that was of course a lie..
6789 2018-07-04 12:30:19 I haven’t done a day shift for 4yrs. Nights suit me, an insomniac retired barman used to burning the midnight oil. Less relatives, less consultant rounds, less complicated discharges, but more confusion I think

6795 2018-07-04 12:29:34 The question should be....are the companies taken the initiative to train them and then employ them?How are their children going to benefit from the oil apart from the percentage that goes to the county and to cater for general services...tumbo kwanza..

6799 2018-07-04 12:29:04 ... and this time keep the oil !
6800 2018-07-04 12:29:02 Ok I can’t stop laughing!  Coal is our past and hopefully oil will go the same way!  Wind and solar are our future and if we had a sane president we would be investing in these rather than telling coal miners there jobs are coming back!

6808 2018-07-04 12:28:20 Did Cuba have oil? We can’t afford rescue the whole world.
6809 2018-07-04 12:28:08 Take the oil to finance the war!
6810 2018-07-04 12:28:03 And , then there were the duels, fistfights on the floor of the Congress, and illegal sake of oil rights on federal land.

This notion of “civility” in government is a recent development. Really only since 1980 or so.

Corruption and self dealing are as old as the republic

6815 2018-07-04 12:27:35 パテさそて( ^ω^ )
6816 2018-07-04 12:27:30 Because we want their oil, we want everyone’s oil so the price can be 5x higher for us to pay for it, lining corporate pockets to then line government campaigns on both sides. How doesn’t anyone really see this and go after the government for this in the streets is beyond me.
6817 2018-07-04 12:27:28 I Need A Oil Change 
6818 2018-07-04 12:27:17 Life is full of hard lessons. I still cant believe people are so dumb that they believe elec cars are against Big Oil. Where do they think natgas comes from to generate the electricity? Do they realize the environmental havoc of lithium mining?

6833 2018-07-04 12:24:51 During that while, solar & wind provided for a part of the increase, partnering with hydro that they spared when producing, so that it could more frequently be used for peaks instead of coal and oil, as well as new lower CO2 gaz units.

6835 2018-07-04 12:24:33 My guess Trump will lift sanctions on Russian Oil. Remember the $500 Billion Exxon project put on hold. OPEC turned Trump down on increased production. Follow the money on this one. Trumps not doing this for free.

6852 2018-07-04 12:22:29 Well ok then they won’t shock you at all. They will shock other people though. The “Asia doesn’t want our oil” argument is actually strongest reason by far to build the damned thing to cash in with zero environmental risk.
6853 2018-07-04 12:22:15 I’ve been reading about palm oil, originally looking for a butter substitute which doesn’t contain the stuff. Now I find it is literally in everything! No wonder Orangutans are losing their environment

6856 2018-07-04 12:21:27 Can you folks please start showing why these price hikes on gas (*cough* collusion) keep happening?

For years we were told to believe oil prices = gas prices... Until oil plummeted and THEN we were told "supply costs".

What happened to the federal gvt ending this gouging?

6864 2018-07-04 12:20:42 This king of reasoning was used in early 2000's to justify that any increase in electric heating in France would result in massive increase of coal and oil use.
Subdued but not 0 increase of electric heating had the opposite result until 2015, because those were put out of use !

Greece.
6867 2018-07-04 12:20:32 And I'm sure the government has a good excuse why the gas prices are so high. What it basically amounts to is they've all got stock in the oil companies and they get greedy every holiday when they know that people want to travel and be with their families.

6895 2018-07-04 12:17:21 Will you be applauding when the US becomes a Putin style oligarchy, with the judiciary a trump puppet? When women, gays, blacks are back in their place? When there is no immigration, so our population ages and innovation dies? Russia has no economy. It produces nothing but oil.
6896 2018-07-04 12:17:20 We'd have figured out how to make renewable or nuclear electricity, and powered most of our systems that require oil to use electric power instead.

Like we're doing now, and note the Saudis are dumping their Aramco oil company because they see the writing is on the wall for oil.
6897 2018-07-04 12:16:58 It's all part of the greatest lie told to the British People - I'm no conspiracy theorist, but can reconigse a snake oil salesman.

7015 2018-07-04 11:59:49 what about the crude oil income from a region shared to other leeching regions? 

Lot of questions with no answers in this Fraud of a nation
7016 2018-07-04 11:59:45 Me too. WD40 and a kitchen sponge. Wipe it off with some cooking oil and polish with kitchen roll, seems to work. Test a bit in a corner to check.

7032 2018-07-04 11:55:53 FYI energy companies sell oil and other chemicals to each other anyway...
7033 2018-07-04 11:55:36 So selling oil doesn’t count?
Even if we lost the $343 billion income from oil we would still have the highest GDP…
It’s just hilarious how you know absolutely nothing 
7034 2018-07-04 11:55:33 Not sure how much more detail you want than eliminate tariffs on products we don't produce.  Seriously olive oil boys - do you not have anything better to do with your time?

7043 2018-07-04 11:54:32 You don't know the first fucking thing about socialism, and I can't help you there because you won't listen. But I would expect you to know at least the first fucking thing about the oil industry, American intervention, and the history of Venezuelan economics.

7071 2018-07-04 11:49:32 Pakistan Inflation in June 2018 clocked in at 5.21%, high understandably due to higher Oil prices and Rupee devaluation impacts.

7098 2018-07-04 11:46:25 Sadly, this has just begun. #Trump started it by walking away from the #JCPOA (which caused an immediate #oil #price #hike), then dictated an oil #embargo against #Iran, then started the #TradeWar which boosted it further.

7101 2018-07-04 11:45:58 The gas & oil companies (the main reason prices are so high) will also increase prices to line their pockets. So it will just go to the wealthy instead of the public good.

7157 2018-07-04 11:36:14 Trump and Putin want access to resources in the pristine tundra & artic including fresh water, oil, gold, high risk minerals. Canada cannot defend agains a joint encroachment on it’s territory by Russia with trump’s refusals to condemn or take action to help Canada protect Artic.

7161 2018-07-04 11:35:34 Turkana locals are now using logs, sticks etc to block oil. Soon they will organize themselves into a militia and use heavy weapons to fight for oil. This is how Boko Haram started in Nigeria. Pole pole tu.
7162 2018-07-04 11:35:32 I agree, Billy, but Trump doesn't want hybrids. 
He wants us to use gas, diesel and coal; thus, he makes it hard for these carmakers by rolling back all the regulations!
Scott Pruitt is sucking up to oil companies, not alternative energy companies.
No market, no innovation!

7245 2018-07-04 11:21:12 I prefer your more historically accurate representation. You could also mention them running to other countries to spread FREEDOM in exchange for nothing (where nothing=oil).
7246 2018-07-04 11:20:43 One of the freedoms a nationalised company would have is look at drug forms of natural substances like cannabis oil. Unpatentable, but requires same rigorous testing for licence.
7247 2018-07-04 11:20:37 Palm  oil was mixed with Ground Nut Oil by a oil company. During winter it gets freezed due to which you can identify the true quality of the oil in the outset.  I took them to task and saw to that they pay for the price for adulterating.

7251 2018-07-04 11:20:08 They help our environment though, and reduce the amount of non-productive driving time by reducing congestion.

BTW comparing fuel cost with UAE is pretty meaningless given the amount of oil they've got and the fact that the government set the pricing.

7453 2018-07-04 10:48:00 they had actually tough fight with Isis, battle of Shaer, Palmyra twice, D.Zour, Yarmouk, E.Aleppo, S.Raqqa countrysides

SDF also had heroic fights, though I suspect some fishy deal were held with Dair tribes to control the oil fields

7457 2018-07-04 10:47:24 Hi Joe. We would recommend the Woodpecker (Manufacturer of the Harlech range) cleaner, it contains oil and so maintains as well as cleans the floor. We have some in the shop if you want to pop in. Really important only to use a damp mop, not wet.
7458 2018-07-04 10:47:12 見た目っ！笑

7461 2018-07-04 10:46:38 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
7462 2018-07-04 10:46:35 The Bribes. If you want a good deal you vote with USA/Saudi Arabia and watch that oil money flow.
7463 2018-07-04 10:46:33 Annualise first quarter 2018 numbers, and Nigeria currently exports the equivalent of 14.7% of its GDP and imports about 8.8% of GDP.

Numbers are flattering until you learn that exports is 93% oil and gas; and imports nearly two-thirds petroleum products!!!

7466 2018-07-04 10:46:27 I was making egg mayonnaise this morning when it struck me that what I was making was eggs in eggs and oil. That's just fucking weird. Are there other such food oddities that are something in the same thing?
7467 2018-07-04 10:46:27 It's all about the oil.

7484 2018-07-04 10:43:45 If you're still talking about "resource scarcity" you don't understand what resources are! As for "climate change", leaving "oil in the ground" will make absolutely no difference whatsoever. Mandelbrot proved that in 1969.
7485 2018-07-04 10:43:39 No, the Seven Sisters were Anglo Iranian (now BP), Gulf Oil (later part of Chevron), 3 of the Standard Oil Coys (now parts of Chevron & Exxon Mobil), & Texaco (now part of Chevron)

At this time the oil pool Deficit must be way too high. Even today our price is less than other countries

7567 2018-07-04 10:31:32 This is horrible, you're right! The #Saudis will flood the market, causing other oil producing nations to be hit, causing misguided unrest (people will see fewer goods/services, suffer, blame their innocent govt=social/political manipulation by outside govts).

7881 2018-07-04 09:39:40 Sun doesn't shine at night. Selling that energy to Indonesia would be useless because they have night-time when we do. Also Indonesia produces more oil than Australia, so your oil argument makes no sense.

Wee hours of the morning & the assault escalated to chemical warfare. MAGAs started rolling coal out their exhausts. We retaliated with essential oil canisters. It's hard to say who got the worst of it. Carbon footprint's pretty big here.

7919 2018-07-04 09:31:31 People often point to Norway's oil/gas wealth and Switzerland's banking as the reasons they're "out" of the EU.

But the reality is both of these countries made the calculation that even with their wealth, they needed to be in the EU's single market. They're not really "out".

8189 2018-07-04 08:39:49 Sure but if it's innovation that keeps companies relevant in the ultra-competitive future, this spending increase shows ambition and a focus on the future. The oil companies are reducing R&D, to max short term shareholder profit: they know time is nearly up

8210 2018-07-04 08:34:17 True but if Talbot has a good year, other teams will be lining up with 3+ year contract offers as UFA and he and his agent will be well aware of that. The better Talbot does, the more likely he prices himself out of Edmonton. Then what, trade your starter at the deadline?

8212 2018-07-04 08:34:09 Much of India’s imported cooking oil is palm oil from Malaysia and Indonesia, known to be high in saturated fatty acids and not a good environmental legacy either. If we embrace genetic innovation, can locally produce healthier oils sustainably

8226 2018-07-04 08:31:30 IMO, they can't offer Talbot more than a two year deal, regardless of how he plays, for the $$$ he'll want. Would've been selling low & don't think it would've went over well w/ the players. Especially, when at best, It's a sideways move but more likely a downgrade.

8244 2018-07-04 08:28:55 All three of Edmonton's NHL-level goalies are UFAs next summer and apparently they put off negotiations on an offseason extension for Talbot.

8257 2018-07-04 08:26:17 They can be quite nasty so if it still hurts or is inflamed after a couple of days see a doctor. For minor scratches & nicks dilute Juniper oil in war water or a bath.
8258 2018-07-04 08:26:14 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.

8261 2018-07-04 08:25:28 ไม่ให้อภัย!!
8262 2018-07-04 08:25:26 True, but in that case, why didn't they trade Talbot prior to the draft and sign Lehner/Mrazek as a cheaper replacement to platoon with Koskinen? Too late now, but if Talbot's not the guy going forward and you are willing to risk losing him via free agency, then move on now IMO.

8293 2018-07-04 08:21:10 Re Blur relief: “Diluted per Homeopathic pharmacopeia” = no active ingredient actually left in the snake oil water. So the ‘active ingredient’ could have been petrol or a range of strong acids - FDA probably recognises these...

8298 2018-07-04 08:20:58 Currently, coal is used to make the steel, but that may change. Some oil for lubrication. The cement base causes CO2 emissions, but alternative cements are coming. The rest of the energy can be supplied by renewable energy, and increasingly so if we keep building wind turbines!
8299 2018-07-04 08:20:54 Lehner may have hoped someone would give him a multi-yr deal but likely knew he'd have to take a "prove it" contract after how it ended in Buffalo. No question on Chiarelli but it was obvious since the signing was announced that they think he's an option as a starter in '19-'20.

8329 2018-07-04 08:16:14 I'd be shocked if Koskinen starts more than 20 games, assuming Talbot stays healthy. And for 20 starts, at $2.5M, Koskinen needs to win 12+ of them with a .910 or better save percentage on season to earn that contract. That's a big ask IMO.

He really struggled when he was platooning with Nilsson, then came on strong once they just kept riding him and letting him get into a groove win or lose. He will want/need 65 minimum again.
8345 2018-07-04 08:14:18 Hi Jade, we would recommend moisturising your skin each day for a few days before you tan but make sure it is oil free as oils can prevent the development of the tan! You may need to spray the mist a little closer to your face so this doesnt happen again - hope this helps!x

8385 2018-07-04 08:08:07 Yes, because of global market fluctuations on the price of oil. You know market fluctuations are unique to capitalism, right?

And in the constant sanctions by capitalist countries and it is clear Venezuela's problems aren't internal.

8391 2018-07-04 08:07:23 I've never been one who believes Talbot's workload has been an issue & stand by that. It's convenient for the masses to point to it as an issue b/c he wasn't good last year but for me that wasn't the problem. IMO, he lost his confidence early on & never found it. #OffYear
8392 2018-07-04 08:07:19 Let's tackle the reality here, the feud came in with the percentage sharing of all the oil sales where community get the lowest of all.

We've seen this happen even in Nigeria where local resistant groups  to such terms happen near oil fields.

It is better sorted early.

8432 2018-07-04 08:02:23 Im with you on that. The goal likely is to get Talbot down to 50-55GP and get more quality starts out of him. You’re asking a guy who’s played just 4 career NHL games, and who’s spent several years in the KHL to suddenly come in and play 27-32GP for you... and paying $2.5M...

8721 2018-07-04 07:06:00 You should pay special attention to the bottle of olive oil you are buying. Olive oil in a metal container or dark glass bottle is the best because it protects the oil from light exposure. The bottle should be sealed because exposure to oxygen can degrade its quality.

8816 2018-07-04 06:46:50 Have a sizeable holding here but  certainly very tempting to add again here sub 60p. .cash pile is growing..oil on the way up. ..today's report rightly highlights the disconnect  between current SP  and core NAV
8817 2018-07-04 06:46:43 SA must move towards building a pipeline that can transport oil & gas from likes of Angola & DRC to our shores, this can decrease fuel price drastically. Another form of wealth tax is introduced.

8820 2018-07-04 06:45:39 Obtaining #Fragrance #Oil can appear to be an extremely direct and simple process. You basically visit a nearby specialty store or go on the web, buy the aroma of your decision, and make a superb noticing fragrance.

8872 2018-07-04 06:36:54 Peppermint essential oil + Rosemary essential oil = hair growth 

Never apply essential oils directly onto your hair/scalp, mix with a carrier oil. I use grapeseed & castor oil.

8873 2018-07-04 06:36:47 I'd been keen to hear when you find something that you find great, mate.
A lot of stuff is a little expensive for me to keep trying this oil and that oil, and of course each product sales person wants to tell me their product is the best.

8882 2018-07-04 06:35:14 Peanut oil is no problem. Peanut protein doesn't survive typical peanut oil, only cold pressed.
But I do have to read labels on everything. The worst is no M&M's. Even the plain, cause they "may contain peanuts".
8883 2018-07-04 06:34:47 Oil is a toxic substance that is bad for the environment and people. We need to use less of it and keep more of it in the ground.

8887 2018-07-04 06:34:32 It’s not an “either/or”/“black/white”. There is a transition to lower carbon fuels & ways of using carbon-based fuels while capturing carbon emissions. In the meantime, Alberta & Canada (w some of the best environ/labour stds) have a role to play in providing our oil/gas products

8894 2018-07-04 06:33:37 That's a tough one to avoid. It seems like peanuts or peanut oil is used in everything these days.
8895 2018-07-04 06:33:29 In India, traditionally, we have been using ghee, coconut oil and mustard oil mostly. All 3 have high heat tolerance. Soyabean and other seed oils are recent phenomenon of last 10-15 years.
8896 2018-07-04 06:31:40 Just like most oil producing countries we are looking at the potential revenue negating the very local resources aka people who ought to be part and parcel of the whole undertaking. Once the oil is seen as theft by outsiders all bets are off.

The Arabs used oil to grab the Brits by the balls from the turn of 20th century onwards, threatening to stop pipeline construction, etc. You know nothing about how oil is used as a weapon by the Arabs. So much for giving them sovereignty.
8951 2018-07-04 06:22:19 Ibe cannot even meet with the president for 6 weeks after his return from London is talking about getting a call to allocate oil blocs??? I am not understanding anymore. NNPC GMD is indirectly doing your job as minister for state. Stay woke
8952 2018-07-04 06:22:19 
8953 2018-07-04 06:22:15 I was going to ask you to make the paint, just with oil or show me how to make it. I don't want to make fires like you do. I'd likely burn the house down even if the fire is outside. If that doesn't work then I'll have to go the expensive route.
8954 2018-07-04 06:21:59 I will let the phone ring for a while cause I know it will take her a while to come e to the phone, hang up and call her after few minutes and then she will be next to the phone. Bad memories ke castor oil, why did we suffer, go tseba Modimo. I loved her.

8997 2018-07-04 06:14:18 Almost over! Here's my letter:

Dearest Love,

The war will be over sooner than expected. Wesson Oil made an anti-Trump statement and the red hats thought it was Smith & Wesson, so they began smashing all of their guns.

I shall return to your loving arms within a fortnight.
8998 2018-07-04 06:14:08 Actually, this is a piece of sophistry. The exchange rate will depend on country-specific foreign trade imbalance, degree of dependence on oil imports and fluctuations in price of crude in the international market
8999 2018-07-04 06:14:07 Castor oil and ischatho were her friends. She'd go get herbs for other ailments like flu.
9000 2018-07-04 06:14:03 lol. John Wayne and the rest of his buddies did not roll in from central casting to “save the world”. I certainly won’t denigrate the efforts nor sacrifices of your Merchant Marine, either. however, this was not won by “you”. it could not have been won without “all”

9003 2018-07-04 06:13:46 My Dearest Mother,

War wears heavy on one’s conscience as we see the breakdown of societal norms.  Good people are reduced to looting and pillaging (or is it plundering) in order to assure a steady supply of Mozzarella and tomatoes drizzled with EV Olive Oil and Balsamic.

9005 2018-07-04 06:13:33 Genuinely sorry.
But there's so much potential. Russian oil revenue tied up in obsolete agreements about Ukrainian possession of nuclear warheads and Russian possession of Crimea, we have to be fascist for the next year, or decade. Generation maybe. Sorry already. Ok?

9044 2018-07-04 06:06:58 Let the government give security to the people and people will secure the oil. The president legacy will be how he will make sure oil is not a curse for Kenya and that not even one Kenyan or TURKANA losses life because of oil.

9060 2018-07-04 06:04:56 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.
9061 2018-07-04 06:04:24 Great thread I concur, if they had anything on Trump it would be out & so would he. Since that hasn't happened the #Mueller investigation is a disinfo campaign to discredit. Info is the new oil of our age & manipulating it to control the people is the way the war is fought now.

9073 2018-07-04 06:02:18 indeed we are killing Russian government income by selling oil to baltic states and gave Ukraine anti tank weapons, something even Obama pussied out of
9074 2018-07-04 06:02:13 Government alone cannot harness the vast oil and gas resources in the country.They need massive private sector investment in the sector.

9089 2018-07-04 06:00:04 Why do that to yourself? Blend them with olive oil, cumin and a clove of garlic and make hummus instead. Add a little tahini too if you happen to have any.

9091 2018-07-04 05:59:41 They don't have sense like that yet. When oil has not finished inside the ground.
9092 2018-07-04 05:59:34 @annaedwardsnews : #DaybreakEurope: @komileva # I was saying why is #Trump bothering #OPEC about increasing oil production? Why not US shale producers? Let me know @komileva !!!

9095 2018-07-04 05:58:23 We are deeply concerned by a recent report that indicate plans at Salonga and Virunga national parks in the #DRC, for oil exploitation and exploration! This comes at the wrong  as Mountain Gorillas  in these parks have just increased  #SaveOurHeritage

9102 2018-07-04 05:56:45 With the bird I’m all about a nice rub... olive oil base, then paprika, cayenne, oregano, basil, salt and pepper... that is a perfect way to roast a chicken imo.
9103 2018-07-04 05:56:42 I guess if you are in America you’re not worried about your President absolutely destroying the oil price for the rest of the world which then in turn drives everything up.

They are quick to find a political angle to destroy the so called “New Dawn” by saying no more Ramaphoria
9104 2018-07-04 05:56:34 “Canada” doesn’t purchase oil. Privately held businesses do. By the by, how would a pipeline built to export bitumen alleviate your concerns?

9106 2018-07-04 05:56:23 Now we understand GOP agenda. Senators from oil producing-refining states meet with the Kremlin. Shelby, Kennedy, Thune, Johnson - don't care about our elections or democracy - just whether the oil companies can access Russian oil. Check their bank accounts for Russian money.
9107 2018-07-04 05:56:18 Petrol and Diesel prices are the almost same as it was in 2013. even price of crude oil has been decreased to more than half but still price of petrol and diesel is same in india.

9115 2018-07-04 05:55:25 UK taxes the production of oil and gas in the UK but does not levy a production tax on imported US shale LNG that has high CH4 leaks  - crazy subsidy that creates jobs in Pennsylvania - remove the subsidy on imported oil and gas now!

9119 2018-07-04 05:54:11 Turns out I’ve been using tanning oil instead of suncream like a pure mongo. Which is pretty risky business for a ginger! But this is the first year I’ve taken my own version of a tan so I ain’t stopping with that tanning oil

9135 2018-07-04 05:52:12 It’s because it has a high smoke point. Stir fry in general needs a high smoke point in order to keep it from getting mushy. Peanut oil is on par with sesame and avocado oil is amazing if you don’t want the oil to leave behind a taste

Not to mention very large oil reserves 

We could do that for less than we have spent defending that border for decades

9227 2018-07-04 05:37:00 Having a police department may be a byproduct of a version socialism. But so is a government owned bank, or oil company, or utility. CALPERs stands to bankrupt California. Tax money to guarantee full wages for government retirees. Trillion dollar hole.
9228 2018-07-04 05:36:59 LOL, we don't go to war for oil. We go to get our gold back we bought the oil with and then we buy more oil from the new dictator and sell them used weapons to fight the last guy we invaded. It's the circle of freedom baby!

9232 2018-07-04 05:36:25 Then i damp a washcloth with warm water and clean the excess oil off. There are more oils and methods you can do, this is just works for me. Maybe look for some YouTube videos to help you find what's best for you!
9233 2018-07-04 05:35:33 #Whisper #IranDeal It is said that Iran will limit its missile research and development to 300-kilometer missiles and will unite against Europe to buy 1 million barrels of oil a day and pay its money through the European Central Bank. #OOTT #ECB
9234 2018-07-04 05:35:30 Trump is dead set on polutant oil and coal plants. Solar and wind is clean and will live beyond ore supply. We all know that emissions from coal and oil kill people every year. Nuclear plants like Cherobil are a learning experience.
9235 2018-07-04 05:35:14 Mrs loves the olive oil - and it's not a bad "mild" additive to it...

We're going to a cookout earlier in the day, so I can't watch the smoker, so I'll be Sous Vide'ing it while we're gone so I can just slap it on the grill when ready...
9236 2018-07-04 05:35:10 one of my irl is chugging olive oil should i call the police

Like she would spend so much oil and my aunt would tell her why are you doing this, they'll do well if they studied well etc but she did it anyway and it was such a sweet gesture and it was her love for us
9247 2018-07-04 05:33:52 Hi I dont know you and this sounds crazy but use an oil cleansing method! Using store bought facewashes is harmful to your skin and actually causes more acne, my skin is not perfect but its so much healthier. I gently rub my face with tea tree oil to clean off the dirt/makeup +

9251 2018-07-04 05:33:19 So maybe you guys should take that grease and turn it into rocket fuel, or bring it back to the planet, so we could use it as oil and boom...the oil crisis will be solved!!!

9279 2018-07-04 05:28:53 I'm so sick and tired of the US Federal Government constantly turning our military  into an oil & gas mercenary price stabilization force.  They take oaths to protect the country, not oil companies.

9369 2018-07-04 05:09:54 Yes in just read it. Apparently it is ‘renewable’ because the engines would be fuelled by vegetable oil. Strikes me there might be a little loss of energy between the engines and the turbines....  but I’m no engineer!

9373 2018-07-04 05:08:35 US siege of Syria is still going. US still illegally occupies large swathes of Syrian territory in co-location with ISIS, and is preventing the Syrian gov from accessing the state's oil reserves, and endangering trade routes with Iraq. Russia is a deterrent for a larger conflict.

9505 2018-07-04 04:46:09 As long as politicians are in the pockets of big oil and coal, we won’t go anywhere. The straw ban is extremely ill advised and all it really does is tell disabled people their needs are not valid. I feel very strongly about this. I’ve already blocked one person today over this.
9506 2018-07-04 04:45:43 Ethereum & shitcoins are funny money investment scams. Printing worthless tokens out of thin air hoarded by insiders (devs/VCs) to dump on foolish investors believing in fake decentralization snake oil bait and switch scam. Why not use Bitcoin for their fake start up services?

9509 2018-07-04 04:45:20 3 are from oil’n’gas states with advanced hydraulic fracturing installations. 

Russia wants fracking tech. They use 1950s level drilling tech, so their break-even is around $65/barrel. Fracking is around $25/barrel. Their only export is oil/gas. Russian pharma = placebo.
9510 2018-07-04 04:45:03 Very little of our fuel is from imported crude oil.I don’t know what the crude oil price got to do with our coal!We being fleeced here.
9511 2018-07-04 04:44:51 Oi
9512 2018-07-04 04:44:48 Jesus still went to the Temple, which had golden statues and etc, and never spoke against such items. In fact Christ was anointed with perfumed oil by a women who spent a great deal of money on it, Christ's followers Judas especially were incensed saying she could have spent...
9513 2018-07-04 04:44:46 헉헉 안녕하세요 !!
9514 2018-07-04 04:44:31 Honestly Snoopy mightve been my peak. Or Mama duck.

It's either that or "spill some oil on me" with the tires strapped to him.
9515 2018-07-04 04:44:28 Also, the counterpoint that oil exports are a zero sum game and that the amount of oil used will stay the same with the same demand, and that essentially we are only competing with other oil exporters is entirely misleading. More competition is good as it lowers prices and..
9516 2018-07-04 04:44:17 I got new tires on my car yesterday, oil change the day before that, just gassed her up, and now I'm ready to head to Cali tomorrow morning
9517 2018-07-04 04:44:14 Totally classless snake oil salesmen.
9518 2018-07-04 04:44:09 Olive Oil could have ironed it all, performing in the cop car.
9519 2018-07-04 04:44:02 All you need is RSO and Cannabis Oil!!!!!
9520 2018-07-04 04:43:54 Sayang, uji punya NR aloe vera gel yang kata nya bagus buat bruntusan 
Dan uji juga punya kleveru sunflower oil yang bagus buat kulit berjerawat. 
Semua nya baru kepake sedikit ayo kalo mah ambil 100K aja semua nya gaes
9521 2018-07-04 04:43:53 Love peanut oil, it’s relatively cheap and has no flavor and a high smoke point

9523 2018-07-04 04:43:46 Might be the weed talking but @TheRealTriscuit I love you so damn much  rosemary & olive oil is such a vibe.
9524 2018-07-04 04:43:40 DST in the US was changed from the last Sunday in April to the 1st Sunday in April.  It saved about 300,000 barrels of oil each year.

9528 2018-07-04 04:43:07 I hate ordering stuff , I just want my oil kit already 
9529 2018-07-04 04:42:56 trump and his uneducated base. It’s just sad they oppose wind and solar because trump likes oil and coal so thats what they like.

9532 2018-07-04 04:42:20 I would prefer Energy East to TMX. If you genuinely care about the big picture and are not just a NIMBY, sunny days, protester, I will help you get to the east coast to protest imported oil. I have a fuel efficient car and offer to give you a ride across southern AB towards NB
9533 2018-07-04 04:42:14 Give your dogs hemp oil or Benadryl tonight and tomorrow night

9535 2018-07-04 04:41:57 i just read a random ass story about more people burning their kitchen to shit than you’d expect — because they tossed water on oil fires. it’s unbelievable
9536 2018-07-04 04:41:44 just another CRP
9537 2018-07-04 04:41:28 Really? Greenpeace campaigned against sending Canadian oil to Canadian refineries in the east... in effect campaigning FOR tanker traffic on the east coast. Of course that is FOREIGN oil being IMPORTED. Hudema is a shill for foreign agents.
9538 2018-07-04 04:41:25 jst iced the area where i can feel a zit forming until the area was completely numb, applied organic tea tree oil and a salicylic acid cream over the area n drank another bottle of water so if this zit has the audacity to show up on my face tmrw morning then im guna off myself
9539 2018-07-04 04:41:17 Facial sprays

If what you want is the bottle to showoff ;) then buy it once and keep refilling it with your own! 

Fill spray bottle 1/3 of the way with water
Add 2 tbsp aloe vera gel
Add 1 tbsp rose water
Add 1 tbsp witch hazel
Optional: add 2/3 drops of an essential oil
9540 2018-07-04 04:41:05 I took my car to Curry @Honda Auto body to fix my  2012 Toyota Hybrid. After a month, my car was returned with the initial damages fixed  but there was NEW damages; of white scratches on my trunk, my back seat was filthy with black shoe prints and black oil stains. Horrible job!
9541 2018-07-04 04:40:41 Wanna know what this world is coming too?? How many of you guys can change your own oil?

9544 2018-07-04 04:40:12 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
9545 2018-07-04 04:40:04 Makeup wipes

This is good because the ingredients are super cheap so you can make a lot.

Fill a mason jar 2/3 of the way with water
Add 1 tbsp of baby wash
Add 1 tbsp of coconut oil
Optional: Add 25 drops of essential oil (tea tree is good for acne)
Put cotton pads in jar
9546 2018-07-04 04:39:28 Unfortunately this is a false statements,  the first Thermal Liner Hanger made in OMAN , it was designed and made for Oxy Mukhaizna few years back by Vanguard Oil Tool & Services. 

For a large company like PDO ,  they should look for facts,  and support the local companies.
9547 2018-07-04 04:39:07 The dairy industry is going to shit, but you can get some cheap crop oil from these guys. Probably not the best place to plug your company. #SocialMediaFail
9548 2018-07-04 04:38:59 US willing to give some exemptions to India on Iranian Oil & might extend a waiver on S-400 in due course. Only remains to be seen what India agrees to sign in return (re: Foundational Pacts is my take). Give & Take the transactionist approach. Lets wait & see.
9549 2018-07-04 04:38:56 Bro eh, excluding heavy industries, oil companies, telecommunications etc, all of whom don't depend on the govt for power currently, Nigeria still needs at least 30MW to stabilize,
9550 2018-07-04 04:38:44 Would every leftwing college student please
study the history of Venezuela over the last
25 years? Socialism took the country from a
rich oil country to the depths of desperation.
Wake up idiots.
9551 2018-07-04 04:38:27 Meal for today
Rice porridge + squash.
Sautè with coconut oil and garlic.
9552 2018-07-04 04:38:24 Sold a lady an essential oil product instead of the lotion she wanted. Shopping feels so pointless but I can’t stop thinking of the next merchandise to covet knowing I’ll think it useless right after purchasing it.
9553 2018-07-04 04:38:19 Also, there are massive risks towards the communities that this pipeline is built around. Trans mountain has had SO many oil spills. The idea that to aid the environment we must harm it is to ignore the reality of the dangers of climate change, and the fact that we CAN act now.

9555 2018-07-04 04:37:48 Texas is not so advance, but I love the idea.
Same as it won't envision Willie or his clan.

Shame, shame, shame.

We were Democrats before Republicans.  Needs to be covered.  We loved the farmers before the oil workers. Who NOW pay us more.
9556 2018-07-04 04:37:46 She probably thinks that anything other than gun oil and new car smells like piss.
9557 2018-07-04 04:37:37 Who will belive that they trained Jihadis to kill innocent people just to please USA? Where war their conscience?
Religious fundamentalism (RF) has nothing to do with USA, Russia or anyone else. Sequence is this.
Oil - Money - Power - RF - Wahhabism.
9558 2018-07-04 04:37:09 Venezuela has as much oil as Any other oil producing country and yet is dirt poor, particularly after they decided to be socialists.

9570 2018-07-04 04:34:48 Egg white face mask

Separate egg whites from yolk
(Oily skin)Add Aztec clay powder- mix into egg whites until it is the consistency of a clay mask
(Dry skin) Add coconut oil- Add one teaspoon of coconut oil and mix
Or just apply the egg whites straight to your face!
9571 2018-07-04 04:34:43 Man I hope that cable breaks. And that nylon harness keeping this idiot safe. Nylon. Made with oil.
9572 2018-07-04 04:34:37 Essentially, by relying on a massive economic boom from cross Pacific trade of the tar sand petroleum, it makes us EXTREMELY less likely to aid the environment. Even if we use the money to build up our own green energy, all that dirty oil is being pumped into other nations.
9573 2018-07-04 04:34:22 vape oil. Please I must see
9574 2018-07-04 04:34:20 That is true, but he was able to convince Republican senators and governors to go to Russia and beg for peace, all for making money for themselves. Such a weak representation for America. OIL, money, for these parasites. Never America!!!

9582 2018-07-04 04:32:23 Waste of time and money, no one has lied to anyone. Everyone freely uses oil; today there are other choices. I don't see this going anywhere. Cancer meds are poison to humans. Is the goal to kill cancer before the meds kill people is there a lawsuit there?
9583 2018-07-04 04:32:18 I remember when I wanted a challenger lol sedans are the wave bruh trust me. I’d only get a coupe as my second whip. Having a car note may be ass but it’s worth it when the only maintenance you pay for is oil changes
9584 2018-07-04 04:32:00 I'm not supposed to eat coconut either and when I was cooking a lot I found sour cream (dairy or non-dairy) is a great substitute for coconut oil or milk in savory receives. Best wishes!
9585 2018-07-04 04:31:49 Dear @chrissyteigen if you do nothing else the rest of your life, you MUST make you’re new body oil scent into a perfume because I wanna smell that shit all day.  But also your banana bread.... I would also be Ok with that as a perfume.
9586 2018-07-04 04:31:49 اتوقع هذا الانجاز ليس صحيح على ارض الواقع ، اول Thermal Liner Hanger تم تصميمها و صناعتها في عمان كانت من قبل شركة Vanguard Oil Tool and services  بالتعاون مع شركة اوكسيدنتال عمان مخيزنة قبل عدة سنوات ، للعلم شركة Vanguard هي شركة عمانية خالصة.

9597 2018-07-04 04:29:09 Stop it. Leave the oil in the ground, idiots. You can't breath money.
9598 2018-07-04 04:28:49 Ya paren esa pelea. Los suplementos (en general) no pegan una cuando son sometidos a RCTs. Son mayoritariamente snake oil. Salvo quizás para casos de genuina insuficiencia clínica, plata gastada en suplementos es plata botada.

9600 2018-07-04 04:28:42 Use coconut oil
9601 2018-07-04 04:28:40 Yes that’s fine!  I feel like if it cooks too long you’ll lose the rich flavor of hummus anyway 

Sometimes I just make a creamy/white sauce with pasta water, olive oil, and hummus lol (the pasta water thins out the hummus to a saucy consistency) Plus lots of garlic & basil :3

9604 2018-07-04 04:27:13 We did it with cigarette companies, I believe we should be holding companies accountable like oil/fuel companies, companies that fill our landfills with computers, tvs, cell phones instead of having a return recycle, ag companies that pollute our waterways with runoff.

9619 2018-07-04 04:22:51 Close to the end, I just I salt the water liberally and when the it is almost done I drain most of the water (I leave a small layer of water on the bottom), dump in marinara, chili flakes, olive oil, and sometimes hummus for creaminess. Then cook in the sauce for a min. or two

9628 2018-07-04 04:20:48 Agree with you Adam. And if we couple this with the fact that physical oil markets are currently weak, we are in for a correction.

9635 2018-07-04 04:20:05 Actually no. It’s for a logical national energy policy. How about refining oil here instead of sending it to American refineries and paying ridiculous prices for gasoline although Canada is supposed to be a major oil producing nation
9636 2018-07-04 04:20:04 Indeed! I love Taliah waajid products! She has quite a few I don’t use everything but what I use works. And i found out that after Shampooing my hair I put Jamaican black castor oil in it before the leave in and my twist outs come out more defined. It’s really helped grow my hair
9637 2018-07-04 04:20:01 Elf makes a good one. Also the broadway ultra lip rose hip oil is also nice
9638 2018-07-04 04:19:59 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
9639 2018-07-04 04:19:50 The oil field is good money but it’s a lonely life out here
9640 2018-07-04 04:19:49 Last Friday they came and did another small patch on Haralur rd near Indian oil Petrol pump. Hope this  Friday they will come and fix the remaining patches on Haralur rd.
9641 2018-07-04 04:19:42 tl;dr: calories in vs. calories out. Green tea, coffee, probiotics, glucomannan, coconut oil, and capsaicin can help

9645 2018-07-04 04:18:59 Esp if that bread can be soaked in olive oil and balsamic vinegar

9656 2018-07-04 04:15:59 Thanks. It’s an Apple Cider Vinaigrette, which has great fat burning properties. I use Olive Oil for some recipes. I’m currently playing catch up on my calorie intake, due to loosing too much weight 
9657 2018-07-04 04:15:56 Coming from a cosmetologist that’s never used it idk, but biotin, and coconut oil in the hair as treatments defiantly work.
9658 2018-07-04 04:15:45 Oh, i picked that castor oil thing up FROM black people that suggested it to me!  I worked in a beauty supply store for 4 years.
9659 2018-07-04 04:15:35 I was just at Costco tonight. They, like my supermarket, have every oil *except* peanut oil. /shrug
9660 2018-07-04 04:15:32 A mix of coconut oil, olive oil and vitamin E oil
9661 2018-07-04 04:14:47 Seconds ago, Ajit Pai began drilling for oil in the Constitution, but you were too distracted by Trump's tweets to notice. Sad!
9662 2018-07-04 04:14:34 Her argument is illogical, not uncommon for her, but seems to promulgate the view we brutish feminstas should all shut up remaining the girly-girl 'weaker sex', & all will work out OK. She's obviously never heard of the noisiest squeak in any machine getting the first of the oil.
9663 2018-07-04 04:14:31 I started lifting pretty seriously last year, a couple months before my 70th birthday. I hit the gym about three days a week. I also drink a cup of tea each night made from cannabis infused coconut oil. Both help keep me strong and ready to #Resist at the drop of a hat.
9664 2018-07-04 04:14:27 I'm really not sure where you're coming from. Are you suggesting that the searches for #MH370 and #ARASanJuan should not be conducted because they are not profitable from an oil & gas industry standpoint?

9676 2018-07-04 04:12:17 Not immigrants who are destroying ecosystems, but unregulated oil, gas and chemical industry.  Fracking guzzles fresh water like crazy.  Illegals do jobs that Americans will not.  We benefit from lower prices on produce and many goods because of them.  Their labor is needed.
9677 2018-07-04 04:12:16 I got Dean's hand clean and bandaged, holy oil is close by in case he wakes and starts anything, Jack is safe and sound asleep, and I think everyone has stopped blaming themselves. @castiel_of and I will be sitting with him until he wakes up. *sigh* it's going to be a long night.

9681 2018-07-04 04:11:19 Always feel as though you’re burning the midnight oil? Get yourself an academic planner and spend a few hours planning for the month ahead.
9682 2018-07-04 04:11:10 No we don't import oil from US. But  US being major power in global financial system as advantage to do so. We must focus on creating different resources of energy so that we become independent in energy, the same way US did by becoming self dependant in oil production

Mr. Khamenei, Iran can defeat US only if Iranian leaders rely on and trust Iranian people. Because Iran's economy is highly dependent on oil proceeds, US believe it can bring about a collapse of Iran's economy.

9746 2018-07-04 04:01:27 That teacher that confronted Pruitt has much more 'cool' and poise than I would ever have in a sinit situation.

My first reaction would have been to ask him about oil and natural gas and why he loves fucking natural gas wells so much and why he fucked with crude oil as lube.

9755 2018-07-04 03:59:16 Oil increases nightly, in my town it'll be $1.35 during the day, early evening back down to $1.26 So that is the oil industry taking it to you, not a tax, or carbon, but simple conservative greed.

9763 2018-07-04 03:58:11 One hung that annoys me about a lot of vegan is that they think oil is bad for you...well yeah deep frying shit is but sautéing onion is olive oil isn’t...
9764 2018-07-04 03:58:11 Agreed. My Buick Regal was about $30k. More car than I needed. But it's a comparable sedan and when I factor the gasoline difference and lack of oil changes pays for itself in about 4 years and change.
9765 2018-07-04 03:58:07 I was gonna make tostones for the first time...and ummm no offense but that is way too much oil (for me) .. so that’s cancelled. what am I supposed to do with these plantains now lol.. are plantains even edible without cooking them..
9766 2018-07-04 03:58:05 Everyone is saying you’re a big sleaze. Behind your back. To real journalists. That’s the plain truth. Oil is dirty and slippery, sir. You can’t hide that.
9767 2018-07-04 03:57:50 Foreign oil has A part in buying off a lot of people in order to cripple the Canadian oil industry . Bc should invest in a refinery thus have a share in the entire process . Or we should just separate and sell our oil to who will pay the most and stop hosting parasites .

9776 2018-07-04 03:57:16 they tear me up girl and I have to spray myself with repellant.  they don't like tea tree oil either and might be safer for little ones.
9777 2018-07-04 03:57:07 What I normally do which is super healthy is just have olive oil and vinegar on my salad. I also throw in walnuts and avocado for some additional Crunch and fats.

9779 2018-07-04 03:56:38 But when to dig deeper you find so much more. There are more bodies in the cemetery than ppl living in town,&all of the beautiful historical buildings have either been destroyed by biblical floods, fires, or the oil company all the whites make love to demolishing them to expand.
9780 2018-07-04 03:56:29 beautiful!! Is lavender oil good for the skin?

9782 2018-07-04 03:56:19 That is very true however if I were you I would put that sauce on the side or just have olive oil and vinegar because I'm not sure how many calories are in that but it all adds up. Sauces can be very high calorie, high sugar, high carb
9783 2018-07-04 03:56:18 I JUST KNEW IT LAST NIGHT ANS IDK IF IT'LL WORK ON OTHER PEOPLE??? HAHAHA TRY TO PUT SOME OIL ON YOUR BROWS BEFORE PLUCKING THEM
9784 2018-07-04 03:55:55 Idk how cause I look wayyyyyyyy better now & idk why you don’t have the juice maybe you need more baby oil on your skin lol 
9785 2018-07-04 03:55:50 Actually, the Republican Party is owned by Charles Koch.

Koch continues to make $$ off Russian oil.

His daddy created the Russian oil industry.

9786 2018-07-04 03:55:41 Exactly. I love for my man to dress like a slut.  RT @Dy_Lejoi: Women will go all out for a dick appointment. Wax, cute nighties, drank, perfume, coconut oil on the legs only for a nigga to pull up in hoop shorts with a phone charger
9787 2018-07-04 03:55:35 Oil an water don’t mix...civility and stelter don’t either...
9788 2018-07-04 03:55:20 Ah the old Venezuelan trope. Like citing a country we heavily sanctioned economically for their destabilization of the oil markets of opec with the flood of Venezuelan oil, totally explains why socialism doesn't work. Half assed answer #MAGAts
9789 2018-07-04 03:55:15 Oil extraction appears difficult. Both environmentally and also not fully tested as far as I know. Extraction as a by product of Uranium is more possible. The % cost varies depending on size but papers I have read show around 30% of the capital cost.
9790 2018-07-04 03:55:03 I totally feel that one too! Sometimes I can’t resist and I gotta do a little olive oil dip but most of the time I’m good with just wine and talking. My family very stereotypically talks all at once so I can sometimes sneak out lol
9791 2018-07-04 03:54:57 When I was living there I’d get intensely homesick & want mexican or southwestern food. I got guac & salsa & chips from Carrefour & discovered the guac was whirled peas & veg oil, salsa just tasted funky,  & the chips were loaded w/ paprika. All leading to a homesickness meltdown
9792 2018-07-04 03:54:54 I wish i knew more about cars. Yesterday i thought i was only getting an engine oil change but ended up changing my transmission oil, cabin filter and one other thing. Needless to say I drove off $400 bucks poorer :/ #brokelife
9793 2018-07-04 03:54:50 A CBD oil gummy. 

I'm shit at meditating in that situation though.

The only other thing that ever worked for me was a now long gone sleep app . Lovely British man guided you down..down..down..to sleep. It was fantastic for naps!

I've tried other apps...nothing comes close.
9794 2018-07-04 03:54:34 The essential oil helped him :)
9795 2018-07-04 03:54:11 And these "Weder dopers" (read charismatics) are back to finding their redemption in clinging to the laws of Moses. Fasting, tything, giving exactly 10% to pastors, anointing with oil, etc instead of living through grace and love?
9796 2018-07-04 03:54:10 i’m getting into the oil industry some way some how, that’s bank
9797 2018-07-04 03:54:07 I have blades and holy oil. We'll see what happens.

9800 2018-07-04 03:53:20 I think NYT said this morning that the US is coming round to letting India, China, Turkey off for continuing to buy Iranian oil? Or did I misread?

9804 2018-07-04 03:52:43 I laid in the sun by the ocean for three days straight with tanning oil on and everything and didn’t get red at all. What is this
9805 2018-07-04 03:52:20 Pro Tip- Pan fry your frozen pizza in avocado oil.
9806 2018-07-04 03:51:57 There is no oil or gas in Manbij. How about you actually research these things before you go spouting your mouth off about subjects you have no knowledge of.
9807 2018-07-04 03:51:23 Not really. The military is basically, like everything else paid for by a government that collects taxes, a socialist organization. Now, how about we discuss the socialist nature of giving tax money to big oil. Your comment is pathetic.
9808 2018-07-04 03:51:19 Took down my protective style after 7 1/2 weeks. Detangled with water, conditioner and oil. Wash, protein treatment and deep condition in the morning #naturalhair
9809 2018-07-04 03:51:17 I just got home from work and I'm tires as fuck. Plus I'm still waking up early tomorrow to do my oil change and rotate my tires. Adulthood sucks.
9810 2018-07-04 03:51:04 I forgot that its actually Castor oil, because he has earned my vote.
9811 2018-07-04 03:50:44 Yes. I made a bottle of 500mg 99% cbd isolate, coconut oil, etc. No terpenes, cbg, can, etc. I will share with you  Just message whenever you want.

9819 2018-07-04 03:49:16 i also recommend learning from my mistakes and putting coconut oil on your hair beforehand and doing your roots last bc it will burn your scalp lmao so defs do a test if you have sensitive skin !!

9824 2018-07-04 03:48:43 Tell me more about the hair growth oil please sounds interesting #SpreadStyle
9825 2018-07-04 03:48:39 Jamaican Black castor oil really works I’ve been massaging it on my scalp everyday and I’m seeing new growth coming in yaaaaaaas
9826 2018-07-04 03:48:30 What oil is there in Manbij? None. The US is there solely to deter Turkish/rebel aggression on this peaceful city and its surroundings, and to ensure ISIS does not attack the area again.
9827 2018-07-04 03:48:26 There has been too much violence.  Too much pain.  None here without sin.  But I have an honorable compromise.  Just #WalkAway.  Give me your pump, the oil, the gasoline, and the whole compound, and I'll spare you the lives.  Just #WalkAway.
9828 2018-07-04 03:48:23 You in the oil field rich guy

9832 2018-07-04 03:47:58 2/2 Major oil has been the ones stifling development. Ford had an experimental program that allowed ranchers to use hyd powered rangers for several years, then abruptly canceled & confiscated the trucks, the Ranchers loved the trucks and attempted a law suit. Honda is active also

9842 2018-07-04 03:46:54 Dubai is not succeeding. Dubai is a theocracy with oil. There’s a big difference. Success is you being able to start a business while being absolutely anything (woman, Jew, atheist, gay dude). Try that in Dubai let me know how it goes.
9843 2018-07-04 03:46:36 Never looked into the inner workings of the air fryers. I assumed they didn’t have oil.

Surely you can't be worse.

9858 2018-07-04 03:43:57 Essential oils are also wonderful to calm pets who have fear & anxiety from thunder or fireworks. Lavender or Peace & Calming from Young Living in a diffuser or directly on pet's coat (diluted with carrier oil, like Coconut oil or olive oil for smaller pets) can help them relax!
9859 2018-07-04 03:43:45 im literally gonna wash my hair again in the morning it feels so gross im gonna have to soak it in oil its gonna be so dry
9860 2018-07-04 03:43:43 Amazing! All the while, here in Canada greenpeace flies across the country to block oil, protesters tweet about their protests on their mobile devices, while idling their vehicles at 7/11 as they get slurpees in plastic cups with single use straws. Talk about twisted priorities!

9896 2018-07-04 03:38:39 Spoiler alert: that will never happen because the imPOTUS was made to put him in place by Putin. Why? Oil investments by Russia. Good grief. This isn’t even a 24 piece floor puzzle. It’s tic-tac-toe.
9897 2018-07-04 03:38:33 So oil co's contribute to CC. If oil is bad then I'm assuming that RI will stop the trucks that bring in their food, clothing, medical supplies.  If they use oil for heating they'll shut off the tapes and vehicles unless electric will be banned.
9898 2018-07-04 03:38:30 Oil: Oil briefly rose above $75/barrel, after EIA data showed US crude inventories dropped by 9.9M barrels in the week ending June 22, which was less than half of the expected by analysts.
9899 2018-07-04 03:38:27 No, because many are not sending the cost to you... Oil will. but its still a small fraction of the cost compared to a "carbon tax" that gets printed on the  receipt when you purchase something...

9914 2018-07-04 03:35:49 I’ve seen a documentary where astronauts went to space to use nuclear weapons to save Earth from a meteor.  They had to drill holes and detonate the nuke from the meteor. Lost a good man there. I’m pretty sure we would have to recruit some offshore oil rig guys to accomplish this
9915 2018-07-04 03:35:35 Russia can post anti Hillary ads and put out anti Hillary propaganda to sway the election. I would if I was them. Hillary wanted to start a war with them over oil.Trump would be their best interest for their people. It doesnt mean Trump knew about it or had anything to do with it

9919 2018-07-04 03:35:08 Aktionærerne i @DanskeBank_DK er nu med til at give DB mulighed for at svindle fortsat og hjælpe hinanden til at blive rigere! Myten om at de rige betaler skatten lever videre. Mærsk need that oil. Are @larsloekke ready to repeat ‘03 (@martinlidegaard) and ‘07 (@Kristian_Jensen)?
9920 2018-07-04 03:35:06 I'm taking 20 drops of CBD oil a day and you'd think it was Adderall.

9924 2018-07-04 03:34:42 It might be late night, but I want to inform everyone that if you see someone asking for money for trades, or asking that you put money to a "charity" to gain access to any chatroom, its more likely a scam. #WTI #OOTT #Oil #CrudeOil #Brent #OPEC #CL_F #Trading #Forex #DXY #ES_F

9931 2018-07-04 03:33:01 This is bad, but exemption was adopted under Obama & was pushed by former EPA Region 8 Admin. who is now attorney w/oil and gas firm Beatty-Wozniak. It actually applied in the Uinta Basin prior to the nonattainment designation for ozone.

9938 2018-07-04 03:30:56 Why buy n use crude oil if Saudi Arabia & Venezuela own majority of oil supply? Ripple with its warchest is championing XRP as a settlement asset for international transactions. Who own the most Bitcoin? Not really transparent, but you wil deny this scenario bcs you a bag holder
9939 2018-07-04 03:30:54 My coconut oil also hasn’t been solid in days  this humidity is real life!
9940 2018-07-04 03:30:53 Why are you using mobile devices, which have oil components? Hypocrites!
9941 2018-07-04 03:30:52 Suggest you get a veterinarian opinion on the CBD oil before you recommend it...you did not quote any research from any veterinarian.  Please do a follow up
9942 2018-07-04 03:30:51 When oil falls more than 20%, stocks go up 22%. But oil is up these days!

9952 2018-07-04 03:28:19 #allstartrek If Dawn Dish Soap is gentle enough for a baby duck yet powerful enough to get rid of oil... Forget multiple soaps, I'm going to save money by using it in bulk for everything. Dishes? Dawn. Carwash? Dawn. Body wash? Dawn. Shampoo? Dawn. Crushing guilt? Dawn.
9953 2018-07-04 03:28:13 If you have any lavender oil or scented candles, that may help! But yeah, wrapping him up and just paying attention to him should help a lot. Poor baby!

9957 2018-07-04 03:27:05 Dear Tun, tolong sampaikan kpd bapak Jokowi hutan² di Kalimantamln rakus dirogol dan orang utan Borneo sedang dianiaya. 

Both countries need to urgently ban deforestation for palm oil plantation as I believe things done in bad manner and greed. 

Than you Tun.
9958 2018-07-04 03:27:03 It's fine Cas. Profound bond and all that. I know. Can you get the holy oil from the trunk? Just in case.
9959 2018-07-04 03:26:53 Mr PM,  are you sure that all villages of india is being electrified and supply is 24×7,  if it is not than why you curbed the supply of kerosene oil in rural areas in PDS to vendors.@PMOIndia,@SushmaSwaraj, @RahulGandhi, @smritiirani, @arunjaitley

9962 2018-07-04 03:26:43 Wanji: riprarian reserves have the highest diversity of macanraga and crematogaster with very low diversity in oil palm and none in virgin jungle areas researched in Kalabakan, Sabah #atbc2018
9963 2018-07-04 03:26:25 Y'all be letting your oil get to hot and your food too wet.
9964 2018-07-04 03:26:23 A study in stupidity. Cell phones would not exist without oil. And electricity comes from different sources. CO2 emissions from "green" devices are high. EVs are worse than combustion engines.
9965 2018-07-04 03:26:18 Captain,
We are holding the fort. The MAGAs are hard upon us, throwing parts of their disassembled Harleys at the walls. Dumping hot oil over the walls is to no avail, as we never get it hotter than  warm. However, we find they shrink away when we pour lattes. #civilwarletters
9966 2018-07-04 03:25:43 Maybe you didn't use enough oil?
9967 2018-07-04 03:25:31 スタジオまで間に合う気がしません

Ya know????
9973 2018-07-04 03:24:58 BTW, fuck oil.

9977 2018-07-04 03:24:35 I think your husband might be looking for giardiniera. (Sp?) it’s basically pickled sweet green peppers (pepperoncino) with some other stuff in olive oil and vinegar. 

When you call ahead for Italian sandwiches in Chicago, they automatically ask if you want this.
9978 2018-07-04 03:24:27 Ohhhhh so hard but if you don’t have a face oil, get Face Hero. But I literally use the entire range including the silk pillowcase.
9979 2018-07-04 03:24:22 So Mr. President how is Transport affordable when we discovered oil but right now Petroleum is at 4230/=. Where people have packed cars to use public means and a ugandan being taxed in 10+ different ways. Show love to the natives instead of investors who take everything back home
9980 2018-07-04 03:24:12 Yes because the middle east produced more oil.
9981 2018-07-04 03:24:05 Jonathan Winer:  Important, timely, accurate & dead on in its assessment that US and others must shut down and stop any attempt by any warlord (whether Jiddah, Haftar, anyone) to divert & sell #Libya oil outside unified National Oil Corp. h

9983 2018-07-04 03:23:56 acne sufferers, hello. I have been using frankincense oil on my skin every day and my acne has been disappearing so soon after I break out (which is less), my scars are fading, and my overall redness is fading too. It's a lil expensive but it lasts a long time. Thx for listening
9984 2018-07-04 03:23:51 If oil is made from decomposed dinosaurs, and plastic is made from oil. Plastic dinosaurs are made from real dinosaurs.
9985 2018-07-04 03:23:34 that dawn commercial about the baby animals and oil spills really has me@fucked up

9987 2018-07-04 03:23:27 Y'all do go fund me accounts for everything now & your numbers be all off. "I need an oil change, anything you give will help," goal $1389.57. The fuck kind of car you drive?
9988 2018-07-04 03:23:22 Just imagine how excited corporate oil and gas are. They hit the jackpot with that prick. No conscience, no morals, all take and no regret.
9989 2018-07-04 03:23:04 Ok so i just wing it (ha ) but i buy premade seitan and for the batter i use (dry) flour, creole seasoning, pepper, paprika, red Chile powder, garlic and onion powder and (wet) soy milk with pickle juice! I double batter Then i just fry in oil until the look ready lol
9990 2018-07-04 03:23:02 Hot oil is dangerous, man
9991 2018-07-04 03:22:46 Not only the coal port, clear cutting, dam flooding, raw sewage dumping, Atlantic salmon introduced from fish farms, cruise ships, plastics dumped in the ocean, open pit mining, and arsenic tailing ponds. How much oil and diesel is really spilled from logging and mining? 
9992 2018-07-04 03:22:37 Flats, pink pussy hats and an I care, do you t-shirt. Don't forget sunscreen and tea tree oil, just in case.
9993 2018-07-04 03:22:03 This may sound masochistic but I kinda want to do another large oil pastel pointillism piece...
9994 2018-07-04 03:22:02 @thataylaa can you do a video about facial oils... what to look for in a good facial oil pros cons... good ones bad ones

9996 2018-07-04 03:21:57 I don’t hear any giving a damn about their oil or how they choose to run their country. The only I hear is we don’t want to be like them.
9997 2018-07-04 03:21:52 Moody's - Markets sees high oil prices as main risk to India's economy
Top Risks:
» Higher oil prices are a key risk
» The government's recapitalization package is not sufficient, given banks have not been able to raise capital as planned
9998 2018-07-04 03:21:44 In the mood to make coconut oil and cocoa sticks 
9999 2018-07-04 03:21:42 Oil correlates with inflation which almost tautologically is typical in late cycle.
10000 2018-07-04 03:21:40 What oil war is he referring to?
10001 2018-07-04 03:21:33 I can't find a store that sells peanut oil in any reasonable quantity. How's a person supposed to get their fry on??
10002 2018-07-04 03:21:29 Thanks for sharing. I feel helpless not being able to FIX. Hopefully I’ll see an improvement with the CBD oil. Thanks again!
10003 2018-07-04 03:20:59 Sliced in half, drizzled w/olive oil, sprinkled w/salt grilled 9ver an open flame.
mmm
10004 2018-07-04 03:20:57 I'm an ex-mining person & Environmentalist myself. Mining, like oil and gas is truly good for the world, filling many needs. But lithium for renewables that can drive us all to the Stone Age? A misuse of a valuable resource I believe... Keep up the sense of humour tho!
