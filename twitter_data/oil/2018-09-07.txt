5 2018-09-07 23:58:55 I pass a quick oil change place on my evening commute, and noticed their sign in front tonight. Instead of listing a price as it usually does, it read, “It's impossible to lick your elbow.” I discovered that's true (and probably not a good thing to try while driving...)
6 2018-09-07 23:58:45 I'm from the westcountry by birth, and upbringing. so I'm liberal leaning at heart. Although I've worked throughout europe and elsewhere in the offshore oil (diving) field, I've spent half my working life with other working men. We all have more in common than we have apart.
7 2018-09-07 23:58:30 I need a whole oil rub down
8 2018-09-07 23:58:29 My hair is usually super moisturizer when I take them down but you can spray or oil it if need be
9 2018-09-07 23:58:26 Well, you *would* be delicious if sliced thin, then lightly fried in garlic lemon-butter and olive oil.
10 2018-09-07 23:58:07 Rough start to the evening. Brian Beckner loses a motor going in to turn one, and dumps a bunch of oil. Clean up is underway.
11 2018-09-07 23:58:00 I invented a new mouthwash: put a few drops of peppermint oil in a shot of whiskey. I'm coming for you @Listerine

40 2018-09-07 23:56:15 This is pleather. He had to use baby oil or baby powder to get them on. Either way 
41 2018-09-07 23:56:13 This is the shop i've been going to for 25+ years, no complaints in all that time. The plug threads stripped on a recent oil change at a fast service oil change place I went to when I'd hurt my back + couldn't drive far. My shop doesn't blame them, though I'd like to. And, thanks
42 2018-09-07 23:56:07 What is baby oil for? Why does this baby need to be lubricated? Where are we trying to put him?!

46 2018-09-07 23:55:27 I know getting an oil change is one of the most basics In care care but man oh man does it feel good to have new oil in the whip.
47 2018-09-07 23:55:06 It turns out that fish oil has the effect of reducing your risk for #Alzheimer's disease.
48 2018-09-07 23:54:57 I am, but nothing change about what I said. USA still stolen the oil from Middle East
49 2018-09-07 23:54:56 Need to remember you can't add value to an bbl of oil, or raise your selling $.  This makes over-head costs the most critical part of financial management in a commodity based enterprise.  Share buy backs are great for AMZN, but stupid for E&P's, IMO, until debt controlled.
50 2018-09-07 23:54:52 Specifically horseradish sauce? No, not me.

But I have had DMs detailing how I was going to be fry-cut, deep fried in oil, salted, and dipped in mayonnaise.

But usually it's just lost souls describing their gravy to me. Frankly, none of them sound like they know how to make it.
51 2018-09-07 23:54:21 Maybe some ppl don't like the taste of bitter oils and either won't buy them or will dilute them with a refined oil, not necessarily olive. Many chefs do it from what I've heard.
52 2018-09-07 23:54:14 Poor cannabis oil man. 
But then...it’s a very slippery slope you chose to walk on.
53 2018-09-07 23:54:13 Remember..they have been doing this for 30 years. Remember Hansen in Congress. Remember oil companies knowing 30 years ago and not shifting any behaviors

55 2018-09-07 23:54:03 Like onion price was the reason for Vajpayee's defeat, I hope oil price won't be for Narendra Modi.
56 2018-09-07 23:53:59 I'm happy to answer. I believe there should be a license and age of 21 requirement for all handguns, universal background checks for private sales, like with gun shows, a complete ban of bump stocks, suppressors, and either a ban or registration of semiautomatic rifles.
57 2018-09-07 23:53:33 Seems not even a bit safer than when I had to take very large crude carriers to load crude oil at the Basrah terminal in the early 2005/6.
58 2018-09-07 23:53:28 To care for those who once cared for us is one of the highest honors. You wear it well @paulgreenemedia.  CBD oil is great, used a drop for a migraine and woke up two hours later completely headache-free.
59 2018-09-07 23:53:18 Lrt after I shave mine I put baby oil on that shit and am suddenly unable to focus on anything for hours because holy shit I'm so soft
60 2018-09-07 23:53:06 Time for the beard oil to take action!
61 2018-09-07 23:52:55 Nope. The seeds were sown when Conservatives stacked the #NEB review with oil corp people, muzzled scientists, refused to talk to #FirstNations , fake "streamlined" enviro regs. Error was to not start again, discarding flawed Conservative process. Courts caught them out
62 2018-09-07 23:52:37 Putin killed one of his assets.   Who got the 19% of Russian oil company sold off for relief of sanctions?   Went down in the Caymen islands so nobody knows sir.
63 2018-09-07 23:52:35 Hydrogen very inuffeciant to produce,40%, pumped into the tanker, gets trucked by dirty diesel, pumped into holding tank, then pumped into the car. Prices will be controlled by big oil.
64 2018-09-07 23:52:26 I lived out west when Obama put crushing regulations on oil & coal companies. We became a ghost town. People committed suicide because they lost their way of life. He did nothing for our economy except to destroy it

70 2018-09-07 23:51:50 Largely a function of business model.  To pay debt in an interest up-cycle, in a business model that has zero price control, if far wiser than a share buy back.  If oil prices drop, there's no use re-floating the equity that you repurchased, but you can tap credit covenants.

72 2018-09-07 23:50:50 Took my car for a second opinion on an oil leak and they ended up breaking my radiator in the process. How ironic
73 2018-09-07 23:50:41 Talk about small print. I guess calling them oil bras doesn't have the same ring to it as water. At least it's only one shirt damaged  which is an excuse to go shopping.
74 2018-09-07 23:50:13 It's easier to stay lower on calories when you are avoiding carbs. Anyways, when I diet on keto it's chicken breast, natty pb, olive oil, salmon, etc. If you're keto dieting and eating garbage still, you're just a degenerate 100xer.

79 2018-09-07 23:49:23 No. The Conservatives stacked the National Energy Board with oil corp people, muzzled scientists, "stream lined" enviro regs, refused to discuss with #FirstNations.

- Shatter
88 2018-09-07 23:48:10 Its amazing why no one has focused on exporting gas/oil to Europe. Of course oil may have an issue of refineries.Perhaps it makes better sense to export aframax/suezamax tankers to Europe. No one in Asia wants to tie up their terminals with smaller tankers when all can take VLCCs
89 2018-09-07 23:48:07 Let's be fair, #Obama did inherit the #GreatRecession.

But he throttled the US economy when it showed signs of life.

2014 Saudi oil pumping was an attack on both #Russia & US frackers IMO, orchestrated by Obama leading to softening of US economy via energy.
90 2018-09-07 23:48:00 You are absolutely.  Obama said cant get GDP above 4%, can't increase manufacturing, coal and steel production, can't bring auto industry back to USA, can't drill for oil in Alaska, can't have pipeline, can't #MAGA
91 2018-09-07 23:47:49 On my way to th ER just spilt a whole pan of hot oil on my left hand my fucking skin is gone dude
92 2018-09-07 23:47:47 Same thing also apply to Ahwazi Arabs which sit on top of Iranians oil productions & refinery but they haven’t revolting (unlike the Balochis & Kurds).

96 2018-09-07 23:47:31 @CBCNews CBC News doing a good job (as with Iraq,  as with Serbia, as with Afghanistan, as with Iraq again, as with Libya,, and now with Syria) of justifying the Free World's military aggression in the ongoing oil wars.

100 2018-09-07 23:47:19 Yes I had to make a healthy pizza it had olive oil artichokes chicken and onions :-) 
101 2018-09-07 23:47:13 You seriously need to change your agenda. Oil is a sunset industry, diversify your portfolio.
102 2018-09-07 23:47:01 Hah I see what you did there.
103 2018-09-07 23:46:43 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...

107 2018-09-07 23:45:37 Nobody has said no oil FFS. The point is that it peaks and then slowly declines as renewables come on stream. Everything is at stake, life on the planet. Life for your grandchildren.
108 2018-09-07 23:45:32 Did you brush some oil or honey on top right before you took the pic? It looks delicious.

110 2018-09-07 23:45:07 So if I follow the enlightened Liberal logic correctly, the feral oil and gas companies should round up and put into servitude fifty thousand or so women in order to signal to the world how progressive they are. Sounds vaguely familiar. No?

114 2018-09-07 23:44:45 they're pretty bulletproof, other than some oil starvation problems that are easily solved. they handle crazy amounts of power as well.
115 2018-09-07 23:44:44 Hummm looks like your doing it by hand, advice ... get rid of that blue thing (looks like a Stanley) get a set of marples chisels and gouges plus hones, dont tell your wife but use the best olive oil while sharpening it will save your arm

124 2018-09-07 23:44:00 Ban him from canada and cut off the hydro and oil to the states give it to him and dont let up.

131 2018-09-07 23:43:25 The rigorous audit will show that underneath it all is oil.  Its like when I challenge people to tell me how solar panels and wind turbines can be built without oil.  Answer is, that they would be too expensive to buy, and thus the idea of "renewable" is a hippy marketing term.
132 2018-09-07 23:43:24 Too little too late to meet Paris Accord commitments, the stated goal - half of Canada's carbon emissions come from Alberta and Saskatchewan with 15% of the population. We have to address the elephant in the room - the use of natural gas to extract heavy oil in the oil sands.

Kate whispers to him, turning of another piece. This time feeding it to him. He sucks the oil from her finger tips softly as she chuckles. His eyes closing and a soft moan escaping his lips. “That’s what I said.” She jokes opening the box -
138 2018-09-07 23:42:39 Post Media is owned by an American hedge fund, has support for the oil companies in its mandate and has been working actively to introduce American style conservatism into Canada. It is not a newspaper. It is a propaganda organ for corporatism. This is not news. It is propaganda.

141 2018-09-07 23:41:39 Zucchini, there are 3 ways to make them delicious. First one, risotto. Risotto with zucchini, my favorite. 2nd, stir fried, with some garlic, butter, etc. 3rd, steamed, let cool down, cut in half on the long side, olive oil, salt; have them with bread.

143 2018-09-07 23:41:06 Not a good look for your boss Murdoch, who has a very lucrative contract with Genie oil, given a contract, illegal of course, by Israel to drill in the Syrian Golan heights. YOU wouldn’t want a voice for the Palestinian people, refugees for 70 yrs, to be PM would you arse wipe?

148 2018-09-07 23:40:07 If you drink a whole bottle of soy sauce you could die. That’s a fact. But it’s amazing with sesame oil as a salad dressing. Jus sayin 
149 2018-09-07 23:40:06 .@realDonaldTrump Just watched two videos, the first in which you praised Papadopoulos as a a good oil guy. He was sitting at a table with you and others. The other is video is of you saying you don't know him. Are you lying or do you have a frail brain?

151 2018-09-07 23:39:48 So they bomb Norway and Austria who are working together to try and take over both Sweden and Finland, meanwhile the Arabs are doing donuts in supercars while finding more oil and getting richer, South Africa nuke itself Brazil decides its had enough of Argentina and takes it

153 2018-09-07 23:39:03 @realDonaldTrump Get rid of the bad guys and deceit yourself, and do whatever you think is right, because I know it's definitely true because I know you. Our only request is the same as saying that you run the oil and bank sanctions without any exemptions

168 2018-09-07 23:35:53 @realDonaldTrump India and China do not talk bigger than their mouths, there is no exemption, if you get a barrel of oil from Iran by November 4, then you will face a massive sanctions sanctions, the issue of global terrorism is the issue of nuclear weapons,

171 2018-09-07 23:35:19 @realDonaldTrump These words must be denied,I have the right,as someone who has played an important role in the return o the sanctions,to ask you that oil and bank sanctions should be implemented without any derogations,I have a lot of rights in this matter because I was bothered

176 2018-09-07 23:33:56 @realDonaldTrump I repeat the sanctions on oil,the sanctions on oil,because this is important more than you imagine.We criticize the government for a few days because we clearly see that they arenot doing their own duty.We donot look at who we are who we are,we just say the truth
177 2018-09-07 23:33:52 Talk about a bad investment. Iran could’ve been better off than Japan with all that oil money and potential for educated population. Instead the Mullahs used the Iranian people’s brains to memorize Shi’a slogans and their money to spread terror. Not that the Mullahs’ care though
178 2018-09-07 23:33:38 I don’t have any hysterics. Nice try. I know that’s your cutesy little word for anyone that disagrees with you. Put simply, I have a brain, common sense, and never bought into a snake oil salesman. I have never met a trump supporter who can carry on a real conversation. Not one!

208 2018-09-07 23:28:27 That could also be indicative of sloppy work habits of any mechanics/shops that have changed your oil...and then there's the over-protective-over-reach of shops who do the work and want no responsibility unless they can pass it on to a vendor...sorry to hear that.
209 2018-09-07 23:28:13 Keep in mind...Coal and Oil generation plants do not last forever. You and I are ALREADY paying to keep this inefficient, costly, polluting technology afloat.

232 2018-09-07 23:25:24 The A&D helps the itching, also keeps the skin soft while it heals and prevents cracking, it’s more lanolin based, it creates a barrier, but wipes off easier. So u reapply more, I usually use aquaphor because it’s also lanolin based but it has mineral oil.

279 2018-09-07 23:16:26 Ćaća od onog Rockefellera koji je osnovao Standard Oil je bio žmukler, da bi se ta familija koju generaciju kasnije proširila ko metastaze, nije li Agrokor trebao biti generacijski poduhvat, čini mi se da je možda malo prebrzo narastao, pa je pukao ko balon.

285 2018-09-07 23:15:39 Is this to do with the vast oil reserves in the occupied Golan Heights that Israel wants to keep? It has already granted drilling rights to Genie Energy owned by Murdoch, Rothschild, Cheney and Israeli ex-military. Seems Israel is planning to flout MORE international law and stay

292 2018-09-07 23:14:46 We tried a new wax today. Thinner. Less painful but kinda hard to grip. Can’t wait to see how I’m going to react to it though since it’s essential oil based.
293 2018-09-07 23:14:45 I did.. Grape seed oil, Canola oil n at times olive oil served in a gallon (name restrained)..His reply: Ditch those rubbish junks.. ensure you get the Cold Press Coconut oil from your health food store, brand RAW.. I got a pic of it.

296 2018-09-07 23:14:11 Light sweet crude oil requires less energy to refine and sells for a better price. Part of the reason for the WCS discount is the need for transportation given the refinery locations, most of which are in the Gulf. It’s more than just math @charlesadler !

307 2018-09-07 23:12:21 I hear alot about how we don't need oil and gas. Trudeau obviously supports that view for he had a hand in shutting down Northern Gateway,  Energy East, and now Trans Mountain. I think Alberta should test this theory, shut the pipes in BC completely down! Do 6 months trial.
308 2018-09-07 23:11:58 @realDonaldTrump says it is in good faith it is therefore good faith. But, to Canadians it is not good faith. Canada can walk away. We can cut their oil supply line from Canada and renegotiate a new price for Canadian oil. Canada must not rely on the US as a trading partner.
309 2018-09-07 23:11:47 One observation from when I was in the food industry: "Healthy"as a marketing buzzword since it's arbitrary. Businesses labeled healthy (Non-GMO, GF, etc) food full of sugar, oil, etc. Consumers satiated biological drives for fat and sugar but felt psychologically good about it.

312 2018-09-07 23:11:13 Definitely agree, Oil is the dirty money and at the moment I believe that’s what they want. Idlib is where Syria has gas and oil, the Golan is illegally occupied by Israel & Genie oil is supposed to be drilling there. Rupert Murdoch, Dick Cheney are two of the board members...

315 2018-09-07 23:10:39 If Trudeau is going on an apology tour, why not start at home?

He should apologize to Canadians for saying that he would supports the oil and gas industry, that he would run "modest" deficits, that he would help the middle class, etc,.

322 2018-09-07 23:10:09 When you deep-fry, hold each piece of food with long tongs as you add it to the oil. Hold it just below the oil's surface for five seconds before releasing it. This will seal the exterior and stop it from sticking to the pot or the other food

325 2018-09-07 23:09:50 That would not have anyyyyyything to do with the oil reserves there. Pfffft!!   Saddening rhetoric repeated time and time again in other places and yes, other reasons.  Here we go invading again. Fucking tiresome.
326 2018-09-07 23:09:43 And the rich get richer.  Bill Gates is the single largest shareholder (13%) of Canadian National Railway, so is making a killing.  Warren Buffet (Berkshire Hathaway) owns 100% of BNSF.  Both moving millions of barrels of oil per day.
327 2018-09-07 23:09:37 Yeah! He said any face oil so I’m assuming don’t use shit like olive oil lol
328 2018-09-07 23:09:30 The snake oil salesman need to go smoke his pot and chill out.
329 2018-09-07 23:09:09 I recently tried the King Arthur recipe using olive oil and added baking powder.Surprisingly good bubbly flatbread tasting. These look great. Tortillas are so easy to make!
330 2018-09-07 23:09:05 Isn’t it strange how hypocrisy works. Condemn the rich, but invest with them. Condemn oil companies, buy their stock. Condemn carbon based energy, and have holdings. Why? This is contempt for the “little” folks.

341 2018-09-07 23:07:41 The money the DoD spread around in the US during the cold war, even in the Humanities, was astonishing. That made Cndn schools jealous, but also made the education there better. Less USAF funding of ethics profs. The Cndns ended up getting their money from oil&gas and bay st.

346 2018-09-07 23:06:29 @realDonaldTrump Hey dumbass. You won't ruin Canada with your tariffs. We can just turn off the taps on all the oil, water, and electricity that you get from us. That would ruin you. The ones getting hurt the most from your tariffs are your own citizens. Resign and confess!
347 2018-09-07 23:06:10 Trim the bare minimum, give a silk pillowcase, soak it in coconut oil like once a week, biotin is a miracle worker, get a leave in conditioner and put that in your hair when you get out of the shower, get a wet brush and brush it out after you put your product in.

360 2018-09-07 23:04:47 If we subtract the GHG's from producing 3 million barrels/day of oil for the USA, Canada would be below Carbon neutral.  In fact, it's the USA's demand for fossil fuels creating our excess GHG's. Nothing, absolutely in your climate plan will have any effect on climate at all.

364 2018-09-07 23:04:10 Does coconut oil work for him? I know it doesn't have the same allergens as tree nuts - we've used it straight for moisturizer. For hair, you can put it in a spray bottle with rosewater (shake it up/warm it up before use).

393 2018-09-07 23:00:21 what kind of country would imperil itself the way we do?  Dairy cartels, Quebec's stranglehold on Ottawa, sending a man-child PM to lecture the world on CDN values while watching tens of $billions in revenue slip away in our oil sector. Sad, just sad.

410 2018-09-07 22:57:30 I put pure rose oil on my rose-vanilla deodorant and I SMELL AMAAAAZING. 
411 2018-09-07 22:57:21 Pretty sure oil and gas contribute to the generation of close to 100% of our economy. Everything depends on oil and gas. Yes, even getting the soy milk to Starbucks.
412 2018-09-07 22:57:16 Mine was somewhat weird too, overslept a bit and was almost late for my cars oil change.
413 2018-09-07 22:57:03 Mine too!! Im trying the castor oil method right now. Hope it works for me. Damn the 90s thin brows!
414 2018-09-07 22:57:00 Won it 15 years ago when money wasn’t out of control. Immediately moved to Chelsea where oil money was at his disposal, now at Utd where his spending is just shy of £400 million in less than 3 seasons. He’s a cheque book manager + a whinging bitch at that.
415 2018-09-07 22:55:52 I need my nails , toes and eyebrows done ! I need to go to target and I need to do laundry !!! Oh and I need a oil change 
416 2018-09-07 22:55:52 I’m not swinging for the fences. This week was the first time I sat down and only traded oil futures. 8 wins 2 loses and 126 ticks gained. That was two days. That’s good enough for me. Sure I could have made more or traded more but I only want to trade when I am not at work
417 2018-09-07 22:55:50 Today I found out my white panther only likes refined coconut oil. 

Unrefined coconut oil I guess sucks.
418 2018-09-07 22:55:36 I believe that would be inefficient, but I am not in the oil industry. The best argument is probably the costs involved, being cheaper to transport to a central (in a loose sense) refinery area, and then have it processed for either strategic, domestic or export use.
419 2018-09-07 22:55:30 If you’ve got a blocked nose, use olbas oil... life saver
420 2018-09-07 22:55:25 A country that shared its oil wealth amongst its people,the worlds largest irrigation system free electricity, free further education, free help to set up a farming business, had a state owned central bank, and look at it now, USA meddling and destabilising again
421 2018-09-07 22:55:21 Don't they all sell this snake oil to their unsophisticated viewers. I thought DumbThumb Hannity sold super beets too. Such shills. You wouldn't see actual journalists selling this foolishness, because they have integrity and their viewers wouldn't fall for this nonsense.
422 2018-09-07 22:55:17 Isn't the present leader Jagmeet "let's leave all of Alberta's oil in the ground" Singh?
423 2018-09-07 22:55:01 Because now we're talking Manufacturing Jobs not FastFood Jobs like we were under Obama Pal Big Difference in saying Steel/Oil&Coal jobs with President Trump over Obama an TacoBell LMAO #FactsOverFeelings #Maga #Winning
424 2018-09-07 22:54:54 When your about to use olive oil in a recipe and you remember what your old pal @jamesmartinchef BUTTER PLEASE...
425 2018-09-07 22:54:52 All I’m saying is the Nun is an ACTUAL demon so be sure to spray your essential oil On Guard mix and pray and read at LEAST three gospels before going to the movies. 

Stay safe kids.
426 2018-09-07 22:54:34 My job whom doesn’t know I smoke is taking my car in for an oil change... I’m QUAKING IN MY HEELS

428 2018-09-07 22:54:19 If Bernie wants to go big, he should call for nationalizing the oil companies. That'll get everybody's attention.
429 2018-09-07 22:53:51 Whoever is taking over from PMB in 2023 is going to be very lucky, why?
Dangote Refinery & ferterlizer, Lekki Ports are all running at full speed, with tremendeous impact on revenue, add the rail, roads & power projects, all these impact non oil rev. These are obvious.

441 2018-09-07 22:51:26 Oh my....there’s some pretty good info out there about how it can help with the tremors.  Maybe he would feel better knowing that he can use cannabis oil without the THC (high inducing part)
442 2018-09-07 22:51:15 THC oil?
443 2018-09-07 22:51:13 How long do you spend roasting veggies? Try #PictsweetFarms Vegetables for Roasting & cut that time in half! I roasted brussel sprouts, butternut squash & onions in only 20 minutes! Just drizzle with olive oil & sprinkle with sea salt. YUMMY!! #GotItFree #LetsRoast #RoastEmUp
444 2018-09-07 22:51:10 hell nahh i feel so disgusting it one thing for oil n grease to be on me but rain on top? nah
445 2018-09-07 22:50:52 I have, usually under-educated and prone to believing the BS spread by oil companies etc. When you mention scientific consensus they either look at you blankly or point to the one or two oil sponsered 'scientists' who dissent

447 2018-09-07 22:50:30 Well shysters and snake oil salesman have historically needed to be "well spoken" to lure in his gullible victims. This one lured millions to follow him though some of us finally figured out pretty words don't actually do anything except sound nice but accomplish nothing.
448 2018-09-07 22:50:28 @BarackObama selling snake oil to young impressionable minds today. I think its time to focus on protecting our youth from this band of thugs.

453 2018-09-07 22:49:44 Make no mistake Obama is snake oil peddler, He failed to mention the difference between his jobs being mostly part time, low paying jobs  to avoid paying Obamacare by the employers and Trumps better paying manufacturing and wage increases for those already working. Obama=TPP
454 2018-09-07 22:49:39 e eu que acabei de descobrir que minha mãe sabe onde o oil man mora e ainda fez uma entrevista com ele
455 2018-09-07 22:49:36 Who Will Spritz him with oil for the "photo shoots"? Shoes? Don't forget to accessorize!
456 2018-09-07 22:49:33 Barack Obama is a snake oil salesman. He’s greasy and slithery with his high faluting words-that’s what got him elected. His ability to smarm people but all he is sowing is confusion and discord. @walkaway and don’t listen to him

459 2018-09-07 22:48:57 Does anyone think this industry would be treated so shabbily if they were the Sudbury or Chicoutimi Oil Sands? Hardly.

462 2018-09-07 22:47:32 It needed new oil filter, cabin air filter, engine air filter, an oil change, inspection and thermostat but it’s all done now and Perf
463 2018-09-07 22:47:31 Nothing like being pampered and having your fingernails painted by a 2 yo. It’s just treatment oil but it’s still pretty to her.
464 2018-09-07 22:47:20 One part of world are fighting over oil this end of planet fighting over water
465 2018-09-07 22:47:17 Blackburn Rd now reopened but please take care as oil & fluid were spilled onto the road. There is some sand covering the area so take it easy as it’s on the bend after the Brewhouse.

467 2018-09-07 22:47:09 Fast food outlets for those that are too busy to prepare, cook or with large family n cannot afford proper food. I was never a fast food person.. I tried to maintain my original lifestyle but ended using Grape seed oil, Canola oil in my cooking.

469 2018-09-07 22:46:40 Whether climate change is real or not, and it totally is, the supply of oil and natural gas is finite. There's only so much before we're hosed, which means the inevitable future is renewable energy. By backing out of the Paris Accord, we are ceding that entire industry. Not smart
470 2018-09-07 22:46:37 Olive oil?
471 2018-09-07 22:46:28 Yes. Apple pies from today are garbage. If I wanted to eat healthy I wouldn’t go to McDonald’s anyway. Give us back our oil fried apple pies. I think our age is showing, lol
472 2018-09-07 22:46:16 I think there's something foreign in the oil.
473 2018-09-07 22:46:10 That's the point. It doesn't. The gov't functions only in areas where it can obtain cold hard foreign cash (oil, gold, the elements necessary to access international financing)... the rest of the country is literally run by criminal armies. This can't end well for the hemisphere.
474 2018-09-07 22:46:08 Try castor oil, hair oil, and lower wages.
475 2018-09-07 22:46:04 Surely correlation not causation but since I drank that MCT oil in my coffee, my sense of smell went into high gear and/or my brain has cleared its sensory adaptation cache.

As a result, I’m changing my face soap because I can smell my mustache and OH MY GOD I WISH FOR DEATH.
476 2018-09-07 22:45:40 If that is olive oil, a fave!
477 2018-09-07 22:45:32 The leftists smell of desperation and patuli oil
478 2018-09-07 22:45:31 When I first read this I was like “ass lips?” And then I read it again and was like “oh ass, lips” it made me laugh though. But if you have it on hand sugar and olive oil work well together :3
479 2018-09-07 22:45:22 What's his texture? I use aloe vera gel to moisturize and then castor oil to seal it. I have 4a hair. Very fine, but lots of it.
480 2018-09-07 22:45:11 2 weeks in prison for confusing oil and NG pipelines? You’re giving me grading ideas for my class next semester...
481 2018-09-07 22:44:52 I've been using it comestics cc cream. natural looking. although it's super dewy so I gotta powder and spray but it surprisingly does a good job of oil control. my other faves are the hourglass foundation stick for winter, I would call it semi matt, full coverage.
482 2018-09-07 22:44:40 A huge Lifestyle change for many.. Supermarket trends, easy way out buying Processed, Pre-Packed and Preserved food.. Great easy ideas we all still believe. Suddenly all sorts of cooking oil advertised as being healthy, many different types of olive oils..
483 2018-09-07 22:44:25 Someone joked that their favorite essential oil is bacon grease lmao fucking gross yuck no thanks bye
484 2018-09-07 22:44:23 The honey mustard and onion oil is the best.  By far.

486 2018-09-07 22:44:01 If the CIA did not remove Mosaddegh, the democratically elected leader of Iran in the 1950's, and replace him with our ruthless, oppressive stooge "The Shah" - then the 1979 revolution would probably have never happened. But of course that would have meant less oil revenue to US.

493 2018-09-07 22:42:24 Hmm, Justin are you expecting for oil to be shipped out of BC?
You just can't take NO for an answer, can you Justin? You will spend every Txpyrs $ to buy Voters, won't you?  Have you done the smart thing & told Kinder Morgan, NO to buying the pipeline? Bet you haven't? WHIMP!

497 2018-09-07 22:42:02 I want everyone to know that I was adamantly opposed to the snake oil.

I told our attorney so in writing.  

Alex went off with his parents and formed this business behind my back: Fraud to sell snake oil &  the big bucks Alex used to take my kids and continues to use to sue me.
498 2018-09-07 22:41:59 Good move coming from Alaska, which has no state tax because of all the oil and gas money they generate.  Reminder: oil is used to make plastic bags.
499 2018-09-07 22:41:51 Indeed. And I may have been a tad harsh in describing the growth of CO2 emissions, after studying the series a second time. It's growing for sure, if not in ugly fashion. But to your point: oil use up over 17% just since 2010, or on a longer timeline, 32% from year 2000. #cars
500 2018-09-07 22:41:50 My dog ate the rest of my coconut oil. 
501 2018-09-07 22:41:30 Only way to leave it in the ground is to resettle any community smaller than 25,000 people without paying people to move. Without more oil we will be bankrupt within 10 years. With oil there is a small probability we will not.

504 2018-09-07 22:41:00 My disbelief in the Leftist religion of Scientism which exists purely for the progression of the Shadow Government and the suppression of the free people... is being equated with a fondness for genocide. *yawn* #LiberalLogic #TryHarder #Canada #Oil #ABVote #cdnpoli #WalkAway
505 2018-09-07 22:40:58 Yeah, I'm sure he did. And throwing percentages around doesn't tell you much about anything. Our nation is filthy rich because of it. We've got free education and health care, and the oil companies are still making tons of money. Why give everything away to the  1 %?
506 2018-09-07 22:40:55 Modiji and BJP doesn’t have any control on the international price of oil (petroleum) and the US dollar. Corrupt congress and news media is spreading false propaganda and blaming the government for these. During Congress regime also the price of petroleum became more than 100 Rs
507 2018-09-07 22:40:53 Canada needs trans mountain and many other oil pipelines to shoreline and east. Singh is nothing more than playing into USA interests. What a traitor!
508 2018-09-07 22:40:37 I hope they do because that musical co. deserves fame
509 2018-09-07 22:40:29 The people in Basra know what the score is: Iraq is just a satellite of Iran, and cannot even provide -w/all that oil - basic services such as potable drinking water and electricity because of corruption and mismanagement. They are not fools and their patience has run out.
510 2018-09-07 22:40:25 I can't decide if it's worse if these assholes have "strongly held beliefs" or if they're just cynically peddling snake oil to people dumber than they are. Either way they're scum.
511 2018-09-07 22:40:09 How hard would it have been to stand up for water protectors. Instead Obama continued to let oil companies trash the environment

517 2018-09-07 22:39:13 That's nice. You'll get your reward in heaven..or maybe as a bogof in Asda. I took a hedgehog that sleeps in my garage to a rescue centre I help as he wasn't right. They said I can have him back but have to bathe him twice a day in coconut oil. GirlsAloud maybe.
518 2018-09-07 22:39:10 i have oil & grease all over me from my truck & its pouring down rain
519 2018-09-07 22:38:54 did not get worse, almost instantly got better. i used coconut oil and now i’m using a mix of castor and sweet almond, but it depends on your skin type. also you always feel nice and moisturized.

525 2018-09-07 22:37:41 Dis oil is for dogs and cats.
526 2018-09-07 22:37:29 I would agree with your premise, thus the desire for a more energy rich world.  The EROI of nuclear is around 65.  For fusion, it will go to like 200-300.  Solar is 3-5 and wind is 5-7.  Oil is in the 30's...  That means for every unit of energy that goes into it you get x out.
527 2018-09-07 22:37:21 You know....

Prius has a stable product.

Spoken to ppl who have them & only needed oil change for 200K+ miles.

Just saying.

But they're only part electric.
528 2018-09-07 22:37:15 I have afro and I use this with castor oil
529 2018-09-07 22:37:06 Thanks for the reply. I was thinking NZ oil consumption growth, rather than livestock growth. Oil use up 32% from 2000-2017. Or, a shorter timeframe, up 17.2% from 2010 to 2017. But I've not looked at livestock data, just yet. #Auckland
530 2018-09-07 22:36:59 For real lmao. I don’t even know what they were going for. They had these products at a mall kiosk some years ago. The guy kept trying to tell me my hair “would be very black very good,” if I used some oil.  I took a pamphlet and didn’t look back as he yelled “NATURAL HAIR!”
531 2018-09-07 22:36:56 3 categories will aid the U.S. as it becomes the world's top energy producer: A portion should be set aside in our strategic Oil reserve for war contingencies, a portion set aside for domestic consumption, and the rest exported for profit & international aid: That is my opinion.
532 2018-09-07 22:36:47 Have to say the smell of rubber, burnt oil and petrol from the super cars are just the sexiest thing ever
533 2018-09-07 22:36:30 I'd rather to take preventitive steps oil spills.

535 2018-09-07 22:36:19 In a few decades when the oil runs out, the west will lose interest and no longer support maniacs like Saudis Egyptians etc for the sake of “maintaining stability.” Then there’ll be a period of unrest and rebellion. And a generation later maybe things will settle (2)
536 2018-09-07 22:36:18 That's great! Someday, I will own a Model 3. I bought a used Chevy Volt 4 yrs ago. My old car used 18 barrels of oil per yr. My Volt only uses 3 1/2 barrels of oil per year. My driving lifestyle did not change. I buy wind power from my utility.
537 2018-09-07 22:36:13 Ur already pretty you don't need that garbage oil
538 2018-09-07 22:36:01 Sauté them with some olive oil in a wok or large frying pan
539 2018-09-07 22:35:57 ومما لا شك فيه أن خديجة بنت خويلد رضي الله عنها كان لها كذلك نصيب كبير من محبة رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم، فعن عائشة رضي الله عنها قالت: ما غرت على أحد من نساء النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم ما غرت على خديجة، وما رأيتها، ولكن كان النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم يكثر ذكرها، وربما ذبح شاة ثم.
540 2018-09-07 22:35:48 Issues: hyper pigmentation, white heads, dry and oily skin(I think thats a combination skin).. I use Simple refreshing facial wash, maiyamuna’s black coffee scrub, simple moisturizing facial wash and simple toner with some drops of tea tree oil.
541 2018-09-07 22:35:31 Hit up Doris’s Infowarts website.

According to the FAQ, you can cure “planter warts on yer foots” with a mixture of Skoal, spit, and motor oil. #FakeNews
542 2018-09-07 22:35:23 Venezuela ranks number 1 in oil reserves. Yet they are starving due to their socialism. BTW Exactly the government DEMS want for America
543 2018-09-07 22:35:20 • Baby OR Coconut Oil Issa Must Before I Get Started .. Everyone knows this by now
544 2018-09-07 22:35:04 May get scrubbers. Some have, but thus far only a small percentage. Just interviewed a Cenovus VP and we talked about this issue. Will try to write a column soon. IMO will have an impact on the oil sands.
545 2018-09-07 22:35:03 Cod Liver Oil tabs & airborne
546 2018-09-07 22:34:55 Remember that oil is concentrated solar energy, collected by organisms millions of years ago. It’s natural, organic, portable and has hundreds of uses beyond energy. But you knew that didn’t you. 
547 2018-09-07 22:34:50 Haha. Alobam, Oil Money 
548 2018-09-07 22:34:39 I left the Seychelles at 21yrs old, went back to France to study.. While there, I started eating edibles cooked at the UNI “ sale a manger” .. did they cook with coconut oil?..I don’t think so! Coconut oil back then was the average or poor islanders oil.
549 2018-09-07 22:34:27 @nationalpost WTF importing Saudi oil
550 2018-09-07 22:34:18 He figures people forgot already how horrible he was. He speaks really well and acts “Presidential”. Obama has the nerve today to take credit for the economy? Numbers don’t lie. He’s such a snake oil salesman.
551 2018-09-07 22:34:12 This is the result of response to American/western call to so called democracy, humanrights, and freedom. Let people go to hell as long as oil keeps flowing. #البصر

556 2018-09-07 22:33:34 oil oligarch's telling their media friends to grill him to no end... this is case and point. He smoked a legal substance on a podcast... #sheeesh
557 2018-09-07 22:33:32 You need olive oil
558 2018-09-07 22:33:30 You need to keep on hand organic Oregano Oil essential oil. It's a natural antibiotic.
559 2018-09-07 22:33:13 Are you smoking palm oil ?..
560 2018-09-07 22:33:10 You know what John, I need you to stop trying to regulate my uterus, especially when the #GOP has such disdain for healthcan, education and the parent child bond.
I need you to regulate the banks and the oil companies, not blc they are bad, but because they are too big for me to
561 2018-09-07 22:33:02 Yes but all the while we're refining Saudi oil at east coast refineries and shipping to the US at processed prices???
562 2018-09-07 22:33:01 Gunman at Marathon Oil on West Broad - avoid the area - apparently holding a gun to his own head
563 2018-09-07 22:32:57 Let's completely forgo our ability to be one of north americas enter bread baskets and (microsoft sam voice) destroy arible land for more oil tankers
564 2018-09-07 22:32:52 The Islamic Countries surrounding tiny #Israel invaded without provocation in 1948, cut off Oil suppies in 1967 provoking conflict, with huge losses. The Arab Muslims were determined to wipe out #Israel, and all the #Jews, and use Taqiyya to blame Israel, it's called #jihad!!

572 2018-09-07 22:31:21 @MoutazLibya @HtewishM @Hamam The case of the monopolisation of oil profits by #Misrata is illustrative of several anti-social behaviours which keep #Libya divided. A shared nation involves #redistribution of oil, water etc. & such behaviours make nation building impossible
573 2018-09-07 22:31:16 I had to read this twice. You mean *Texas* (not the US) is set to produce more oil than Russia/KSA? Which is an incredible stat.
574 2018-09-07 22:31:09 Before I couldn't stand the smell of Castor Oil, now I'm cool with it.
575 2018-09-07 22:31:01 The entitled imperialists got sick of being tolerant after ravaging the environment and starting wars over oil. So blame progress on liberals and the global elite.
576 2018-09-07 22:30:58 Desperate for those oil and gas rights...
577 2018-09-07 22:30:24 Did same thing with our oil.. no conspiracy. Is what happened :( we could be so great Again
578 2018-09-07 22:30:13 They are the only wipes I buy. The alcohol and oil free ones are amazing and take off makeup with no problems.
579 2018-09-07 22:30:12 I feel like we could fine-tune that with #CBD.  For instance, I wonder how you'd respond to a THC:CBD ratio of 5:20.  As in 5mg/ml THC & 20mg/ml CBD.  Do you have a #gyo?  DIY your oil so it's more affordable & stronger.

583 2018-09-07 22:29:49 Ooo my arab friend. I really pity you. No freedom, no income. I definetely wouldn’t want that. Never! You know nothing any idea what’s going on outside anyway, keep playing with desert’s sand and sell oil. Just until when oil become useless
584 2018-09-07 22:29:39 I used to call him “Mr. Make it happen” because he would do random things like get my oil changed and brakes fixed without saying a word... a whole year and some later if it’s something I desire Dominique makes sure Kerri & I get whatever it is we want 
585 2018-09-07 22:29:24 In the North American Union today changes when Vladimir Putin offers the new country oil and energy supply, will Prime Minister Hillary Clinton agree after what happened to Old America... let's come back to this next week.

589 2018-09-07 22:29:00 Yah, lets refuse to build a pipe line to get our oil to market or become energy self sufficient with a pipe east... oh.., never-mind.

Wait, let’s tell Quebec they can’t sell their Hydro power the the US anymore. It’s something Alberta could get behind.
590 2018-09-07 22:28:07 There will be blood! errr... water and motor oil XD
591 2018-09-07 22:28:07 Got a cup full of that oil and I’m paid plus I’m.... sitting side ways 
592 2018-09-07 22:27:52 How regulated utilities work unfortunately.  Have an obligation to pick the cheapest option. The MINUTE the crossover point happens gas vs solar, no more gas. NEER goes wherever the $ in the other 49 states r /w a long term bias against not renewable. But there's oil in portfolio
593 2018-09-07 22:27:51 Bun, 1 measly pickle, loaded with microscopic onions, ketchup, oil with a hint of meat, and another bun....
594 2018-09-07 22:27:48 He Haw, My favorite @Chigirl oil analyst!
595 2018-09-07 22:27:40 Government cannot escape by just pointing towards international crude oil prices while reaping money from excise and VAT. Why is Petrol/Diesel not under GST when most states are now BJP ruled? #86toomuch
596 2018-09-07 22:27:23 Snake oil salesman. All talk no substance
597 2018-09-07 22:27:21 Coconut oil and lemons ....

599 2018-09-07 22:27:12 What would happen is Canada stopped all the electricity and oil exports to the United States? Hmmm sitting in the dark and $7.00/gal for gas at the pumps and no natural gas for heat. Ruination?? I wish he would be quiet and work with our allies and not the autocrats!
600 2018-09-07 22:27:11 I dont believe in global warming. Machine called Haarp. Forces winds 2 change. (History channel) oil has always been here..wealth under our feet:) use climate change 2 stop us.

614 2018-09-07 22:24:58 Were any of Musk's companies up for government contracts?  I see the Air Force is considering pulling his security clearance.  This couldn't have something to do with his thoughts on climate change and oil subsidies could it?  A bit more conspiratorial than my normal views, but..

618 2018-09-07 22:24:33 Justin Trudeau is merely one more snake oil salesman, smooth as the oil he sells. He's not fit for his position.
619 2018-09-07 22:24:21 The mechanic who did my oil change today left his number in my car cup holder and I just really didn’t see that coming 
620 2018-09-07 22:24:13 I think he googled it and found the "petroleum tax" for oil company profits. Which is really rent for being allowed to pump up a national resource.

623 2018-09-07 22:23:46 Somebody in this store smell like piss and oil.
624 2018-09-07 22:23:42 if no one talks about what's going on in yemen then no one will feel bad for buying saudi controlled oil.
625 2018-09-07 22:23:31 One of the best benefits of exercise is that it keeps your blood from coagulating into sludge with the consistency of used motor oil mixed with corn syrup.

628 2018-09-07 22:22:49 Yes I and my sisters prevailed despite so many shouting us down. I still say the names of those frauds - old and young - pimping around Water Actions, ceremonies and more, pretending to be upstanding friends of the people & lands despite predation, oil doings & more.
629 2018-09-07 22:22:49 They were all democrats. Half of his speech was a lie. Just like the lies he told for the last 8 yrs. Taking credit for our great economy is pure but he’s a great sales person. Selling that snake oil. U would probably buy it. Not me
630 2018-09-07 22:22:46 We are living in the last days.  Folks are going to have to get some #HolyWater and #Annointed oil from your #Priest or Preacher if he is without sin to pray over it.  And when you and your family leave the house sprinkle your #HolySpirit on your body / car/ kids/ dogs.
631 2018-09-07 22:22:41 it's amazing, please treat yourself to this show. The ED is animated with oil on glass and the whole show has gorgeous character acting.

639 2018-09-07 22:21:05 I also wish more people realized we do actually have many laws regulating guns. Some of the laws  may need better enforcement but a lot of gun control advocates act like we don't have any restrictions.
640 2018-09-07 22:20:57 Nah he isn't. He just struck an oil deal

643 2018-09-07 22:20:19 I can only talk about my own journey. French origin grew up in the Seychelles Islands eating lots of fresh locally grown veggies, fresh fish, grass fed beef, free range poultry, eggs and cooking with Cold Press Coconut oil.
644 2018-09-07 22:20:09 I use oil of turnip.
645 2018-09-07 22:19:41 #DYK We were the first refinery to ever exclusively process synthetic crude oil from Alberta’s oil sands. It’s something we’re proud of and why we continue to focus on innovation here in #abheartland! #strathco #fortsask 
646 2018-09-07 22:19:32 Buh-bye Coconut oil.
647 2018-09-07 22:19:24 We need to pray for many more to be saved... so that their eyes/ears will be opened. They can come to the wedding feast. They need oil for their lamps. We need to pray for family, friends, strangers, Israel 
648 2018-09-07 22:19:17 @theresa_may it's a shame that Southern Cameroonians, a former British territory are being slaughtered by President Paul Biya's army but the British government is more concerned with signing oil deals. I will never vote for the conservative party. Double standards ?

654 2018-09-07 22:18:25 Just another grandstanding politician. No depth of character, no moral value, just mesmerizing the voters. Snake oil salesmen. All of them...
655 2018-09-07 22:18:23 No, is that a marula oil use?
656 2018-09-07 22:18:10 Steve We need You to join the only party representing The People of The USA! I did because the Koch Brothers don't own the Democrats & any Democrat that is will be gone! Also We need to move on to the future! A future without burning oil! Please come join the future!

664 2018-09-07 22:17:14 ويجب احياء السنة لتخف العنوسة والرذيله من الجنسين
665 2018-09-07 22:17:11 And if you follow my Twitter account, you'd know better than to tell me to report on the suffering of Basrans. I've been doing that for quite sometime, and stick to my argument that Basra has been ghettoized by the government and various parties who want to profit off its oil.
666 2018-09-07 22:16:41 Trump has sanctioned Russia; bombed Russian interests in Syria with the redline that O ignored; he’s fortified defenses in Poland; He has fought the German Russian oil pipeline. He is trying to win in Syria, China and NKO. All three them are allies with Russia. Putin is key.
667 2018-09-07 22:16:34 Are watching news? First do that if you don't know abt oil bond used by UPA to purchase crude.
668 2018-09-07 22:16:33 that's weird, you look like a guy who insists on changing his own oil
669 2018-09-07 22:16:09 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, but the duty to stop it cold and she didn’t do it.
670 2018-09-07 22:16:07 I don't even mind some of the gun regulations. Waiting periods make total sense to me. I also like background checks and think a gun safety course is a great idea. I just wish we talked about some of the other issues more because this can't be solved with gun control alone.
671 2018-09-07 22:16:02 Do you take fish oil pills?
672 2018-09-07 22:15:58 Nothing grinds my gears more then when men at an auto shop talk down to me. I can drive tractors bigger than this shop so just change my oil pls.
673 2018-09-07 22:15:52 When u dont speak put tongue on upper part of your tongue cave. U will get more manly face becouse face muscles will rest or u will get melted face. This also produces oil to go to your pineal gland which is good for u.
674 2018-09-07 22:15:47 اولاً يفضل عند ذكر الرسول عليه افضل الصلاة والسلام ان تصلي عليه
وثانياً انت تتكلم عن مجتمعك اللي حولك اللي وش جابه عند الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم
675 2018-09-07 22:15:41 No, he decided to sell Ultimate Bone Broth which against TOS. You can't sell people snake oil lol
676 2018-09-07 22:15:40 i know i sound like a whole vegan butttttt,,,, the oil cleansing method saved my leprosy ass face
677 2018-09-07 22:15:26 my response using the term colonial did not exclude the moorish empire and Islamic conquests and Genghis Kahn. You miss the point. Paris etc cannot forget history the role they played in creating the problems we now face. Oil etc now drives governments not humanitarian vision.
678 2018-09-07 22:15:11 Recently, a scientist supported Prof Michels in her “coconut oil pure poison” hypothesis/fearmongering. When called out and faced with RCTs examining coconut oil consumption, all refuting his arguments, he asked: “I do science and publish. Where are your papers?” Sure.

Maybe they forged Adeosun NYSC certificate

690 2018-09-07 22:13:34 Will other natural resources like coal, oil and gas get the same treatment? Hasn't thought it through has he. Well it shows hes PM material doesn't it.
691 2018-09-07 22:13:32 How much of that is because the massive government subsidies? Steve, you tend to massively leave out the details. Wind gets approximately 1,000 times the govt subsidies that oil gets. You know that, then you crow about the expensive labor paid for by....wait for it....our taxes!

694 2018-09-07 22:13:15 Why do old people in Alberta always ask why you're not working on the oil fields like people die their regularly, drug and alchololism is rampant and it's not nearly as profitable as it was even 5 years ago

700 2018-09-07 22:12:27 Joe Miller has run so many miles these past four years at college that the kid needs an oil change
701 2018-09-07 22:12:23 Should build a huge refinery in Alberta then we wouldn't have to depend on U.S. gas . Stop exporting jobs to  U.S. raw logs, oil etc. We import too much from American manufacturers and then get screwed by Trump .
702 2018-09-07 22:12:20 #CBB disappointing that the British public didn't see through the snake oil salesman that is Sally the spooky mega con woman, the success of the supernatural over reason

704 2018-09-07 22:11:27 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
705 2018-09-07 22:11:11 Probably doing $20 prints or something like that! This is a big oil piece so the og would be super pricey

Are you aware of a new earthquake fault running along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico?

Where do you think oil drilling should be ongoing?

Please, name the places so my son in laws can move their families there.
717 2018-09-07 22:10:17 Nooo.. He was awful . He also seems to  divide by color and that is shameful, sense he is of mixed haritage. Snake oil salesmen always speak well . Trump is rude, speaks badly and is not environmentally friendly but he is good for us right now.

721 2018-09-07 22:09:20 @dpradhanbjp Government cannot escape by just pointing towards international crude oil prices while reaping money from excise and VAT. Why is Petrol/Diesel not under GST when most states are now BJP ruled?
722 2018-09-07 22:09:11 Let me ask u this..y do we buy oil & uranium from other countries & us the consumer has 2 buy it back 4 quadruple the price, when we have plenty here?

731 2018-09-07 22:07:40 coal and oil were coming out of the ground in many places of the world not just in England. it did not lead to Industrial Revolution. availability of fossil fuel is a condition necessary but not sufficient.

740 2018-09-07 22:06:46 45 doesn't believe in climate change? How can the EPA/gov do anything on Big Oil's behalf when climate change is so vehemently denied? Suffer and pay for the supports necessary for oil rigs, platforms, refinery equipment to withstand the storms to come.
741 2018-09-07 22:06:42 Luckily you are correct, I'm living proof. Been married over 35 years, & I ain't no oil painting.

750 2018-09-07 22:04:48 Ninjas are an Illuminati plot to keep oil prices rising so that the world will descend into darkness and despair. It’s a long con, which is why the ninjas have chosen the Turtle as their avatar. You notice how the turtles are always fighting the Foot? That’s because oil companies
751 2018-09-07 22:04:48 Next he’ll bring back pay phones and oil lamps.
752 2018-09-07 22:04:47 I take CBD oil for my anxiety and it’s really helped me! I like it because it doesn’t have any side effects like my medications do, so it calms me down from an attack without knocking me out. Hopefully it helps you too!
753 2018-09-07 22:03:59 You could well be missing out! Like, when the hairdresser gets all texture paste etc it does look cool, but at home with a good conditioner and a light weight oil it’s so soft and silky

757 2018-09-07 22:03:18 They want to kick Bashar out then subjugate South Sudan and get a firm hold on the oil. The West will not a risk their soldiers without a commensurate return in mineral resources.
758 2018-09-07 22:03:13 (That's not a criticism, BTW. Their religion was important to them. Understandably so.)
759 2018-09-07 22:03:06 Put the pizza into a frying pan  (no oil) and fry both sides....don't knock it until you try it ;p
760 2018-09-07 22:02:56 The protests started in July over poor services despite them being an oil rich area and started blaming Iran for the problems after they stopped supplying electricity, they blame Iran for taking their money and influencing their politicians
761 2018-09-07 22:02:55 Does that include Putin & Russia. Friends of the President. Does that include the Steel Dossier. The oil .
762 2018-09-07 22:02:37 You seem like the kind of guy that they're more likely to keep an open mind about When I was a single conservative lad, I didn't avoid religious women at all but I was less likely to be considered and we were less likely to get very far. Not sharing their faith was an obstacle.

767 2018-09-07 22:02:10 It's about necessary minimal control
Like oil just enough to keep the machine going not too much that it slows it down or too little so it sizes up.
768 2018-09-07 22:01:55 Only Norway has been dependent on oil, historically; but has used its national wealth fund cleverly...
769 2018-09-07 22:01:54 I drink green tea almost every day. I get Gold Peak brand because all it's got is water, the tea leaves, and sugar. No high fructose corn oil and no other weird chemicals

780 2018-09-07 22:01:09 Trump is all stage, all snake oil salesman.  Great job young man!
781 2018-09-07 22:01:04 They do I grant you that. They loved it when he allowed them to walk over us and rack up huge trade deficits. They really miss him now that we drill r own oil reserves moving closer to energy independence. And boy do all the Islamic terrorists miss him or did til they were killed
782 2018-09-07 22:01:01 Selling CBD oil has become such a huge blessing in my life and in others.  I just never expected this.  I have no idea how many people we are helping now, it’s such a beautiful thing!
783 2018-09-07 22:00:36 Trump is just experiencing what it's like to be discarded by the people who propped you up while you gave them what they wanted. They got their tax cuts and Iran. They got help for oil, gas & coal. They got their defense budget. And they funded their buybacks. His job is done.
784 2018-09-07 22:00:35 TMW you turn off the car in the middle of a wanky Jerry Garcia guitar solo, pump a full tank of gas, check the oil, restart the car -- and Jerry Garcia is still in the middle of the same wanky guitar solo. Damn, man. Closure, okay?!

795 2018-09-07 21:58:52 its technically a berry, so yes you are correct.  I have a super easy recipe on my blog for homemade mayo and make it with cold pressed olive oil (I find avocado oil too heavy for that).
796 2018-09-07 21:58:49 Look at how wealthy people really close to that administration became after bankrupting that nation and fleecing oil and gas. But yeah let’s bring them al back sounds good
797 2018-09-07 21:58:46 Yea, thanks to oil wells. It’s not like they have invented or patented anything useful. Even their refineries are purchased! What then after oil? You know that the world is moving towards clean energy, don’t you?
798 2018-09-07 21:58:36 "I'll slaver you in olive oil and vinegar to prepare. Let it so into your plump visage and then I will decorate you into the finest edible plant life and wildflowers. You remind me of a young rugged dark curly haired man. He too wanted to consume and to be consumed."
799 2018-09-07 21:58:35  If they stopped using oil products to protest with then someone might actually take them seriously!  Anyone else sick of the hypocrisy!

803 2018-09-07 21:58:17 Look at crude oil. There are LITERALLY ~1,000 prices on offer in the world, with a HUGE range of 100% from the lowest to the highest. So what "is" THE world price? WTI or Brent are mere indices. (We should have an export tariff on crude oil)
804 2018-09-07 21:58:09 YouTube will rot your brain. I tell my kids to use their BS meter and if any ?'s ask me! I had a sister who was she would cure my other sis cancer with a few drops of pot oil, surprise it did not

Brexit 17 showed cracks, 33+% of SNP voting against EU & Sturgeon posturing for EU over UK.

GE17 was the confirmation of her disastrous decision.

828 2018-09-07 21:53:08 Building more refinery capacity has been delayed for too long, and while Oil may not be scarce (yet), with the U.S. set to become the world's largest producer by 2021 under Trump, refinery capacity is, and we should shore up that deficiency quickly.

I don’t know what’s more shocking:

Obama is so delusional he believes Trump represents the status quo.

Or Obama thinks the Democrat base is so stupid they’ll believe Trump represents the status quo.
845 2018-09-07 21:49:48 Just plain stupid... cutting regulations, Tax cuts and putting oil, gas, and coal Workers back to work is the reason our economy got better....Hillary was not going to do any of that. Not to mention all the fair trade deals... Obama had no clue of what to do.....

884 2018-09-07 21:45:04 Thank you for #climatechange reference. Browder's book showed this scientist in 2016 that the election was all about oil and opening the Arctic to drilling with Putin. And, BTW, you might want to look at yr personal risk - abrupt climate change is here and that's the scary kind.
885 2018-09-07 21:44:56 That's not what the government got and GERs assumes Scotland gets all its oil and gas revenues.

But yeah, dudes in their 20's want to get laid period.

915 2018-09-07 21:41:11 In the aggregate it's possible, but mostly on account of conservatives more likely to belong to religious groups (like Mormons and devoutly religious) that would exclude you from their serious dating pool anyway.
916 2018-09-07 21:41:09 Thanks!! If it starts getting worse and/or more constant I’ll def look into using CBD oil. I don’t feel like it’s *quite* bad enough to warrant trying CBD oil yet but I’ll keep it in mind for future reference.

963 2018-09-07 21:34:28 Last night on The National Rosie Barton said clothing industry second biggest polluter next to the oil industry.  What about coal?  What about automobiles burning gasoline? India burning tires?  What’s her fact base?  Typical CBC.

966 2018-09-07 21:33:19 One tip.  If you " activate" nuts first, they are a lot more digestible.  You activate by soaking for 24 hours .At that stage you will get very plump almonds. You can then simply role in your chosen spices and salt, redry them lowest heat for a few hours. No need for oil at all.
967 2018-09-07 21:33:04 kanada, emptied of its minerals and dirty oil. emptied of its trees and water. a crippled thing, drowning in a puddle, covered in ants. the ocean doesn’t give a shit because it knows it’s dying too.
968 2018-09-07 21:32:58 Unless you forgot to put oil in it, or the starter doesn't work, or there's something wrong with the transmission.  

I drive an electric car and it has little to do with the environment.  It's not for everyone, but for those it works for, it's a vastly superior experience.
969 2018-09-07 21:32:52 Given you just replied shows you haven’t had time to read any to know. Posting a statement from Scott Armstrong, a well known oil indutry funded climate denier and saying the last big storm was yonks ago shows me it’s not worth wasting my time. Ignorance is bliss isn’t it?

1040 2018-09-07 21:24:01 Hope so and from what I can see there is wage growth but inflation seems to be taking that all away example oil prices / costs of living. When the fed raises interest rates that’s when I’m worried record industry debt

1042 2018-09-07 21:23:58 Basra produces 3.5 million barrels of crude oil each day. Still, it has no fresh drinking water, no electricity, & the decisions for the region are made by politicians serving the interests of foreign powers rather than those of the people. Basra needs to become a federal region.
1043 2018-09-07 21:23:49 So you believe in the value of hard assets. A lot of people seem to be concerned with deflation. I don’t believe we will experience deflation but it’s easy to be nervous with bitcoin and oil falling. I do believe it’s only temporary.

1048 2018-09-07 21:23:18 They all deal with the Russians. They get paid to be pro Russian and lower sanctions...so the Russians can sell oil and gas...it all is about that.

1066 2018-09-07 21:20:51 Great article. Russia and China have hundreds of billions of reasons () to ensure a stable Afghanistan and Pakistan. An international oil pipeline and a multi-billion dollar port facility are worth protecting. And anything that bothers the US and India is bonus for them.

As US protectorates, GCC policies r shaped by US interests. 
While Turkey plays the Russian card vs the US/NATO card, GCC has only 1 card. Its politics is shaped by age-old tribal rivalries & petty jealousies and by the Wahhabi/Shi’ite divide.

1087 2018-09-07 21:18:13 Fair point about quality. We met a cannabis oil processor today, definitely provided an interesting perspective of mids/lows and quality trim... they can find themselves an end market
1088 2018-09-07 21:18:06 I agree. It’s not like they are sophisticated oil paintings themselves. No need or justification to be so nasty about others #stephenandpatwebb #Gogglebox
1089 2018-09-07 21:18:03 "Here I am. Taking this /fabulous/ oil painting of a 19th century winter scene. And nobody seems to even attempt to stop or thwart me--- ohhhhh well." She whistled. Already having hacked the system so the cameras would be on loop. Cliche but useful.
1090 2018-09-07 21:18:00 I'm craving sweet potato chips so bad. They're my latest obsession. I prefer the kind made with coconut oil, like from Whole Foods. The taste is so much better than canola or safflower oil.
1091 2018-09-07 21:17:56 @FDA_Drug_Info Please tell me what the update research is for " CBD oil".I have been contacted as a Parkinson's patient over about 120 times to give me free CBD oil. I am sick and tired of all this harassment claiming cure of PAIN!
1092 2018-09-07 21:17:35 So you are saying don’t worry about oil prices they will be fine. RDS has been struggling for the last month.
1093 2018-09-07 21:17:21 That pretty much sums it up. Snake oil salesmen.
1094 2018-09-07 21:17:15 so I was riding my bike (oil product) wearing my bike helmet (oil product) of course, to a protest in my Gore Tex (oil product) jacket and took some great shots with my iphone (oil product).....
1095 2018-09-07 21:17:14 JAMES JUST CALLED MY DAB OIL “BEELZEBUB’S BALSAMIC” AND IM DONE.
1096 2018-09-07 21:17:10 How about Oregano Oil taken internally? Worked for me.
1097 2018-09-07 21:17:04 Ah! Makes sense now  A friend of mine has worked with Hardeep & has nothing good to say about him. He’s not that popular here in Glasgow.  Dan has come across well...especially covered in baby oil! 
1098 2018-09-07 21:16:40 I use argon oil everyday!
1099 2018-09-07 21:16:37 £1.29 here at the minute for Diesel.

1108 2018-09-07 21:15:03 The best things for kitchen burns is lots of cold running water, as quickly as you can get to it. Anything with fat/oil or alcohol is not good.
1109 2018-09-07 21:14:55 And coconut oil fixes migraine?
1110 2018-09-07 21:14:38 only at firestone can you come in for an oil change and end up here over two hours ughh i hate them i been here way too long 
1111 2018-09-07 21:14:35 I found that baby oil helps, worth a try x
1112 2018-09-07 21:14:07 Hydal power per unit cost is RS:2/ , above 10000 MW Cost is 0.50 paisa/Unit.
 thermal is same but hell of polution , Oil is RS: 10+
1113 2018-09-07 21:14:06 Same reason you supported team Kevin  Folta You are as gullible as they are.Pretending everything is ok and dismissing legitimate scientific critcisms of GE as "fearmongering".Upshot is you get shonky science and lots of  snake oil. Isn't that what #GMO food industry is?
1114 2018-09-07 21:13:42 let me tell you a secret, if you have ever been to a olive oil. most of their stuff is not italian in the sligthest

1118 2018-09-07 21:13:06 Do you have any essential oil diffuser recommendations.
1119 2018-09-07 21:13:06 The heart wants what the heart wants and right now it wants fried chicken so let’s get this oil poppin!
1120 2018-09-07 21:12:50 He spied on Americans, gave Iran billions..
11 million people out of work from regs, 20% of America of food stamps, after bp he slowed oil prod of others in the gulf.  Blocked pipe line that raised gas prices. Promised no tax hike, lied raised taxes.
1121 2018-09-07 21:12:47 Oh cool, the dude who sells literal snake oil (dietary supplement, not FDA approved!) to his listeners has a hot take!

1123 2018-09-07 21:12:37 Hello Jonathan. You work in the oil and gas industry which is heavily subsidized. In addition people die in wars over oil. I switched to EV as a dear relative of mine was dying of leukemia due to living near an oil refinery. Her neighbors also affected with leukemia. oil=cancer
1124 2018-09-07 21:12:32 *RBC SEES AT LEAST 1.1 MLN BARRELS IRAN EXPORTS GONE BY END '18
*RBC: IRAN OIL EXPORTS OFF MARKET 'EASILY' UP TO 1.5M END 1Q`19
1125 2018-09-07 21:12:17 The oil industry bought politicians to deny climate change. The health insurance industry is doing the same with #MedicareForAll, getting DC to claim health care for every American is not feasible. We need to stop allowing publicly traded companies to dictate if we live or die.
1126 2018-09-07 21:12:16 I Prove my point. if you don't wanna prove something why you come to here and trying answer me :) Saudis live very well because of oil and before respect international community learn respect Women. Good Night
1127 2018-09-07 21:12:14 Wait...what? I'm confused.
1128 2018-09-07 21:12:01 Maite I reakon chips are hallal cos we frrie them in oil and oil cums from muslamic countries .
1129 2018-09-07 21:11:44 Imagine I had no problem at all.. I don’t mind the flavors..people(including myself) were surprised I adjusted so quickly..I even brought back some palm oil. The only food I failed to like were banku and fufu..
1130 2018-09-07 21:11:22 Don't believe that guy, he's selling snake oil, said the snake oil salesman.
1131 2018-09-07 21:11:16 Hopefully NOT perhaps all the fools who support this should actually meet people from #Venezuela and hear their personal stories, I've met people from there, shocking what has been going on to a nation that is oil rich and beautiful in many areas, destroyed by dictatorships
1132 2018-09-07 21:11:00 All related to Quincy pact : US protecting wahabism for oil and other geo-strategic interests....
1133 2018-09-07 21:10:55 You might be interested in former Liberal MLA's new book "Oil's Deep State" which documents how the fossil fuel industry has too much influence on government policies at all levels ,keeping  us from meaningful action to avert climate breakdown. #bcpoli #cdnp @JustinTrudeau
1134 2018-09-07 21:10:53 #FactOfTheDay!

Standard ingredients in mayo:
Oil, lemon juice (acid), egg yolk (emulsifier), salt.

Standard ingredients in salad dressing:
Oil, vinegar (acid), mustard (emulsifier), salt, AND flavorings.

Therefore mayo is just terrible salad dressing without flavor.
1135 2018-09-07 21:10:34 That is a topic for another day. And possibly not for Twitter. You have automation, peak oil, carrying capacity of the earth, and everything else to get passed before you'll find the middle.

1143 2018-09-07 21:08:58 (Ahem) there are treatments to help relieve eczema. Usually corticosteroid creams, but some essential oil balms can be helpful, too. Lavender, chamomile, and calendula oils in a butter bar made with avocado, oat, cocoa, & Shea butters is amazing! Laser treatments can help, too.
1144 2018-09-07 21:08:18 #totp you could spin an oil tanker on that stage
1145 2018-09-07 21:08:12 What to use in Lieu of Pesticides? Neem Oil, Garlic & Clove Oil, Azatrol, StrawFlower Extract... the list goes on!
1146 2018-09-07 21:08:11 Got a shawarma for lunch and some of the oil dripped out the bottom on to my jeans. So now I have a quite fragrant beef spot on my jeans this afternoon in the workplace.
1147 2018-09-07 21:08:09 So we have finally found the holy grail! Frankincense and myrrh are gold and cannabis oil is the ingredient that the Catholic Church decided to leave out!

1151 2018-09-07 21:07:37 Thank you! I see that they are out of Vernon. Always try to buy my medicine from BC. Made the fatal error of getting some CBD oil from the states, now four weeks later it’s still not here. Will never order from them again.
1152 2018-09-07 21:07:31 Do you have proof instead of assumptions? BTW, I wouldn't talk about hypocrisy seeing as Conservatives are the ones who do not want to hear opposition to #TransMountain and big oil. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #TransMountainPipeline #StopKM #AlbertaWhine

1158 2018-09-07 21:06:08 Depends what’s making it stick. WD is just a silicone spray, if it’s rusty a penetrating oil might be better.
1159 2018-09-07 21:06:07 Looks like you don't have anything to prove me im wrong :) website shows everything about your Country and your Country without Oil is nothing deal with it.

1163 2018-09-07 21:05:30 Do u mean fully wash your hair with shampoo or just shower in general? I shower everyday but use shampoo once a week because otherwise i wouldnt have enough natural oil

1165 2018-09-07 21:05:01 Gold, oil, real estate
1166 2018-09-07 21:04:46 So now we’re all totally screwed, partly as a result of his own efforts, this snake oil salesman is worrying about how he can get HIMSELF out of the mess?
1167 2018-09-07 21:04:26 Another load of baloney from #USOP. Market wouldn't allow them to suddenly produce "news" which is months old. There were no BLM auctions in "July".  It's easy to get small oil shows to surface - you can find it on a walkabout. 2012 all over again. Sad and bad.
1168 2018-09-07 21:04:26 Use Johnston’s baby oil sparingly Donna. It works a treat
1169 2018-09-07 21:04:16 That is beautiful - what gives it that oil painting quality?
1170 2018-09-07 21:04:15 You still have many choices in the industries you just listed. Especially in the petroleum industry. I am in Texas, don't tell me about oil. We have it, we have companies going in business every day.
1171 2018-09-07 21:04:12 And that stupid cause was for oil, not terrorism he had soldiers over there to protect the oil he wanted
1172 2018-09-07 21:04:06 CBD oil is great for anxiety.
1173 2018-09-07 21:03:41 Hot oil is the answer to your question. Been working magic since the 1980s. A trial wonw be a bad idea
1174 2018-09-07 21:03:35 I don't know why this graphic reminds me of #CubanMissileCrisis regardless, we are the assholes now acting like Tweakers breaking into everyone's homes.  Always on some trumped up justifications for Sanctions, Bombings and Invasions, usually its Oil. #amiright #syria
1175 2018-09-07 21:03:33 me: I’m gonna change my oil bc how hard can it be? Just pour it into the hole right?

my car: lol du dummes verdammtes Luder jetzt funktioniert der Tacho nicht
1176 2018-09-07 21:03:23 So the Treaty of Lausanne restricted Turkey from oil exploration since 1923 with the treaty ending in 2023. Coincindence there seems to be an agenda against Turkey because this is basically Turkey after 2023 
1177 2018-09-07 21:03:20 The dude talked about grabbing women by the ****, I'm not surprised he would openly complain he wants a share of Libya's oil to be honest...
1178 2018-09-07 21:03:17 Plz make sure you collect the oil sheikh's  contribution for your campaign

1180 2018-09-07 21:03:14 @cvpayne 2. Since we are becoming the worlds leader in oil export, why don't I see gas prices lowered?  Honest questions and I have to reiterate that I LOVE what's happening in America!  Great AGAIN!

1182 2018-09-07 21:02:52 You ever had a chigger bite? When my mom remarried my adopted father went out into the farm. Few days later he had huge band around his waist. Military doctors at base had never seen it that bad. Momma told him chiggers. Cover with oil they back out of skin. He was miserable
1183 2018-09-07 21:02:41 @KatieAl36845740  Thank you for the like. I will at some stage get the hang of linking the right description to the product. However the carpet powder is all natural with diatomaceous earth and our Natrell oil blend. Want to try a sample, drop me a line.
1184 2018-09-07 21:02:32 Neither are cell phones, automobiles, jet planes, rockets, computers, indoor plumbing, electricity, mass transportation, email, social media, organ transplant surgery, oil refining.... Need I go on? Are all Republicans LOW I.Q.?
1185 2018-09-07 21:02:32 Wait a minute, I thought that exploration  stage ended. I think this oil is more safe under the surface than being brought on surface.
1186 2018-09-07 21:02:32 quel est le coût de la sobriété et quel est son prix ?

1187 2018-09-07 21:02:23 I do have green crack growing as well and they are just starting to flower. Hoping my season will be long enough or I’ll have to bring indoors. The CBD was mainly for medicine for the hubby instead of paying an arm and a leg for CBD oil.

1192 2018-09-07 21:01:51 I had one try and claim it was due to the fall in oil price.
I asked him what other oil producing countries had hyper inflation and a population reduced to eating pets.
He never got back to me with an answer.
They are an oddity, unfortunately a dangerous one
1193 2018-09-07 21:01:49 So we opted for real wage stagnation, rising inflation, higher consumer prices, the demise of NATO, destruction of long-time alliances with neighbors, kowtowing to Putin and Kim Jong Un, burning more oil, polluting our air and water, and general batshitcrazy in the White House!
1194 2018-09-07 21:01:46 Obama’s energy policy taking a nuanced approach to oil fracking leases as compared with aggressive EPA policy towards other hydrocarbons changed the security calculus in the Middle East for the next century for the better.
1195 2018-09-07 21:01:41 its actually slightly more , with oil of unknown region accounting.

1211 2018-09-07 20:59:55 No oil at all ?. How do you manage longer trips then. Stage them to charging points. Can you take them on the M-ways ?.
1212 2018-09-07 20:59:52 Caster oil is so good for your eyelashes omg
1213 2018-09-07 20:59:41 None at all. After all, Salmon aren't Cod are they. The marine economy of the West Coast depends on Salmon and Orca as well as freight from Asia and grain heading west. Oil tankers have no value to the West Coast at all.
1214 2018-09-07 20:59:41 When I come to get my oil changed and they get to asking questions I be like go ask my dad tf lmao I don’t understand anything you asking me... you seen me come here with him why you asking me

1218 2018-09-07 20:59:18 We live in a police state, so conducting such poll can get you in jail easily.

Saudi Arabia is rated 161 out of 167 countries in Democracy Index. Our government is one of the worse governments in the world, yet our economy put us in the G20, thanks of course to the Oil Reserves.
1219 2018-09-07 20:59:13 You’re never too young. I started Oil of Olay and Pond’s cold cream at 15. And my 10 year old avi pic doesn’t look a day older than the day I took it.
1220 2018-09-07 20:59:03 Taxing the oil and gas industry excessively raises prices too, but you don’t see these liberal screamers making a big deal about that.
1221 2018-09-07 20:58:43 Please do come to our Farmers Market Every Saturday morning 9.30am -1.30pm at Kings Road Yard CF11 9DF where you will find amazing  extra virgin cold press pure olive Oil direct from Calabria.

1223 2018-09-07 20:58:38 Some say he is responsible for oil crisis
1224 2018-09-07 20:58:35 Hi Jennifer I use a brand that is a full spectrum oil and has a lemon flavour. I use it for lower back pain and sciatica, just after a few days it has started working and I am sleeping better and not so stressed 
1225 2018-09-07 20:58:32 Of course he's happy! He said "We can't shut down the oil sands tomorrow. We need to phase them out. We need to manage the transition off of our dependence on fossil fuels." Why would be be any different today than he was a year ago? He doesn't give two hoots about Albertans!
1226 2018-09-07 20:58:30 #CarloMarxBot: "Moloch whose microphones are smoking oil! Moloch whose comment is sexless modem!" wrote it first, man. Stop stealing!
1227 2018-09-07 20:58:29 I refuse to listen to any more of his snake oil salesman lies!!!
1228 2018-09-07 20:58:28 Moloch whose microphones are smoking oil! Moloch whose comment is sexless modem!

1232 2018-09-07 20:57:45 Just got back from purchasing more soaping oil. Only had enough for one 12 inch loaf this morning.  Now I can once again get my soaping on!
1233 2018-09-07 20:57:32 I think it does, my veggie gardens didn’t do as well this year either. Heatwave then smoke. Next year I will leave for longer. I’m making CBD coconut oil out of it so am I still going to get medicine from it if I harvested too early?
1234 2018-09-07 20:57:26 Owned by a Oil Tycoon!! Makes more sense to me that Greenbay is America’s team being it’s owned by many shareholders
1235 2018-09-07 20:57:17 I tell ya...the we all gonna die routine is getting tedious. Republics want to pollute the environment...we all gonna die. The republicans wan to drill for oil..we all gonna die. Elect Knute... women gonna die. I know one thing for sure elect Democrats..unborn children gonna die.
1236 2018-09-07 20:57:08 You are very very like very when I say very I mean very oh wait extremely stupid
1237 2018-09-07 20:57:02 Dialogue is the first choice for mature pple; strikes & disruptions are a last resort. Parliament failed to articulate Wanjiku's concerns. 
Dubai is Rich in oil & gas; govt don't need taxes to operate; ditto Brunei.
1238 2018-09-07 20:56:54 BHO is taking advantage of the growing economy He's back out there selling his snake oil again
1239 2018-09-07 20:56:37 Omg you’re right now that I think about it. Someone told me oil and hairspray when I seen this on another celeb. Thank you
1240 2018-09-07 20:56:17 I ain't shaved my legs in so long lmao I just shaved them and but baby oil on them and they look like different legs lmao
1241 2018-09-07 20:56:12 Take a cup, 2 dishwasher foams, some olive oil and a latex glove. Don't thank me later.
1242 2018-09-07 20:56:11 Oh my! I thought I was using small words. Well in addition to resources that are critical to technology you know they do have shiny rocks called diamonds,a bit of gold,some oil,platinum,uranium you know just the little stuff. Lmao! 
1243 2018-09-07 20:56:09 え、こわい
1244 2018-09-07 20:56:06 elon musk is an apartheid beneficiary with the physical form & politics of a college tech libertarian and the wealth & praxis of an early 20th century oil baron
1245 2018-09-07 20:56:01 Eighty percent of the people laid off at TransMountain were men. I am beginning to see Mr. Trudeau’s plan. If there is no oil industry then there will be gender parity in that industry
1246 2018-09-07 20:56:01 Bring the baby oil!
1247 2018-09-07 20:55:59 I hate this so thoroughly. I was recently in a store and the associate chirped, "I have the perfect thing for your curls," & b4 I could tell her to begone, she put her spidery pale hands DRIPPING WITH OIL right in my hair & proceeded to tell me how good it is for "kinky" hair!
1248 2018-09-07 20:55:53 What's the coconut oil for?
1249 2018-09-07 20:55:37 Did you manage to find an oil Amber? If not let me know. The company I work for make a full spectrum oil and have a lemon flavour, if you need one x
1250 2018-09-07 20:55:32 Have you seen the toxic green slime that you've fostered and dead wildlife on both Florida coastlines?  Oil rigs bad; toxic algae not bad at all!  The tourists will love it.! #Vote2018
1251 2018-09-07 20:54:57 Does this moron know where the US gets most of its oil and gas from?
1252 2018-09-07 20:54:55 CBD oil and lozenges help. Innovative CBD sells some really good ones. But a little on the expensive side. But they last 6 hours at a time.

1255 2018-09-07 20:54:29 You’re a snake oil salesman just like Jones. Your work has no journalistic integrity and you have been pushing nonsense from the minute frump let you out of jail so that you can push his false narrative. 
1256 2018-09-07 20:54:25 bald headed bitches always so mad at the world, like relax n get you some castor oil.
1257 2018-09-07 20:54:08 the best thing to do to control oil is applying toner with a cotton pad before. you’ll definitely notice the change! try N. 7’s daily oily skin moisturizer and see if it works for your skin. another good option is clinique’s moisturizer but make double sure it’s for oily skin!
1258 2018-09-07 20:53:53 I think we’re cock blocking Russia from a major oil line while Russia’s leveraging German interests with natural gas off the northern coast and we’re guarding Germany’s flanks from Russian encroachment and and and...bzztz
1259 2018-09-07 20:53:40 Nah, they just leak oil and die on their own.
1260 2018-09-07 20:53:39 You shouldn’t be using oil for this. Foam wrap or mousse.
1261 2018-09-07 20:53:27 Leaving work, about to go get a oil change
1262 2018-09-07 20:53:26 Why do I feel awkward playing the #NintendoSwitch in public....I'm proud of being a gamer...but playing in a waiting room while waiting for an oil change just feels weird...
1263 2018-09-07 20:53:21 CIA effect?Just because they have more oil than Arabia?
It's time for China to help them if Russia is not doing enough just to keep oil prices high and protect their owns oil revenues! Yes?
1264 2018-09-07 20:53:08 Balsamic and olive oil for sure. I use it as a snack all the time just because we have so many
1265 2018-09-07 20:52:55 Fuel Price Hike During #ManmohanSingh Government Time that time 100 % Dr.Singh & his Government is Responsible, but now Only Foreign Policy , crude oil price & America Responsible ! So @dpradhanbjp & your Government Are Sleeping?
1266 2018-09-07 20:52:52 Coconut oil used to be good to me too when I started using it last year. After my skin rejected it.
1267 2018-09-07 20:52:45 oil is heavily subsidied, Green  IS reliable... wind blows here but dougie canceled millions in contracts.sun shines here too my riding has over 500 turbines & some solar farms... towers are installed to test cost effectiveness before turbines are installed. your points are moot.
1268 2018-09-07 20:52:43 Bright side, my car is running like a champ after this oil change haha 
1269 2018-09-07 20:52:43 Skin fix: Did you know that if your foundation is too thick, you can simply thin it out with a few drops of jojoba oil, moisturiser or toner
1270 2018-09-07 20:52:36 C'est comme le bourdon devant la vitre: y' a beaucoup de lumiere, mais c'est pas du tout la bonne facon de trouver une sortie. La solution c'est de faire secession et de creer un monde alternatif, post industriel, agraire, nous meme, now !. Reprendre le pouvoir sur nos vies.
1271 2018-09-07 20:52:36 They are self sufficient in many areas these days. Oil ,wood , steal , you name it. If they tax the automotive sector , Canada is cooked.  All the jobs will move to Detroit Michigan , which is really what he's after.  Lots of empty sitting buildings and subdivisions in that state
1272 2018-09-07 20:52:03 There will be no trade deal forthcoming - Mexico and USA will go it alone - Have we learned nothing from the killing of the oil sands? There will also be no pipeline.
1273 2018-09-07 20:52:01 Lord thank you for giving @SkinByTrace the vision.
Link her for your beard oil and brown sugar face scrub.
Nev know a face scrub could have me a smile suh..
1274 2018-09-07 20:51:53 I just started taking biotin to really strengthen my hair, but I use the hell out of vitamin e oil (face, hair & nails) and aloe Vera washes then keep it braided lol
1275 2018-09-07 20:51:49 The brunt of the Rs. 2.8 lakh crore Oil scam during UPA regime carrying forward is hurting the fuel prices now. #UPAOilScam 
(During UPA regime money illegally transfered from GAIL, Oil India to HP, BP, Indian Oil - Rs. 1.12 L crore, Oil bond raised from public Rs.1.68 L crore)
1276 2018-09-07 20:51:18 Our nation's #1 snake oil salesman....
1277 2018-09-07 20:51:17 I remember @HillaryClinton fix for them.making safe zones.. if the people were in those safe zones right now Assad would’ve gotten what the 300 Russian mercenaries got when they tried to grab oil feilds .. 200 dead- 100 flew back to Russia for medical treatment!
1278 2018-09-07 20:51:17 we have access to olive oil now! no more need for beef batter! bring back the good recipe!!!
1279 2018-09-07 20:51:15 I knew Jones was a shit head, but I didn’t realize he was a literal snake oil salesmen. WTF
1280 2018-09-07 20:51:08 sup gamers its ya girl just splashed chili oil into her eye its the best day of my life xoxo
1281 2018-09-07 20:50:52 So when and if you get in provide us with government stores that provide fresh food not in tiny packets but big packs of flour suger tea coffee coco  cooking oil soap anything basic that people need
1282 2018-09-07 20:50:52 Praying for little man. I'm not a doctor by any means, but there's this CBD oil called Charlottes web and there is no high due to the very low THC contained in it (< 0.3), but the CBD works wonders for seizure patients
1283 2018-09-07 20:50:02 slb below its 2016 low when oil was 25
1284 2018-09-07 20:49:49 I applaud your ambassador for mental health. How does that stack up against the promotion of cannabis oil as cannabis (as to the best of my knowledge so apologies if I’m wrong) is a proven factor in mental health issues?
1285 2018-09-07 20:49:40 I’ve glanced through some of these files/reports, but haven’t found any numbers to give comparables. 
Did some research and haven’t found any direct correlation between Oil Sands mining & naturally occurring amounts of Benzene.
1286 2018-09-07 20:49:39 exactement. Sans sa touche pro nucleaire, il n'aurait jamais ete poussé sur le devant de la scene et obtenue une tribune. Les decroissants pures qui n'ont aucun copinage industriel n'auront jamais accés au medias et donc de poid politique.
1287 2018-09-07 20:49:30 I made the rookie mistake of cooking chicken in my underwear and I got a burn from the oil on my thigh 
1288 2018-09-07 20:49:09 but i dont have any olive oil

1295 2018-09-07 20:48:27 I just saw it skidding downhill. Is that because of the oil?

1301 2018-09-07 20:47:27 I poured coconut oil all over my body and my skin feels soft as hell

1303 2018-09-07 20:47:07 if Arabia is rich it's because of Oil. if arabs ran out of oil they cannot earn money like now this is the reality.

1306 2018-09-07 20:46:28 No worries at all beautiful. Have you tried cannabis oil? I've stopped my daily chemo after 16 years and started it twice a week, beat thing I've ever done. Sending you so much love and so many prayers 
1307 2018-09-07 20:46:20 God bless Amaz oil & gas 
1308 2018-09-07 20:46:11 I think Notley and Trudeau are celebrating  a very well orchestrated scam. They actually both hate oil.
1309 2018-09-07 20:45:57 The better part of me believes this oil and gas wealth will be squandered.

1312 2018-09-07 20:45:42 Are you implying that we wouldn’t have oil if we didn’t invade people’s homes, take out their leader, and put in dictators in their place. Because I think that’s what you’re implying
1313 2018-09-07 20:45:25 Thank you to the 2018-19 Harvest Team Sponsors: Lozier Oil, Bank of Farmington, Joe Webel with Stewart-Peterson Solutions, Sustainable Building Solutions, Farmington Community Bank, and Marilyn & Larry Gibbs.
1314 2018-09-07 20:45:19 I oil trained my hair! Aka was very patient and relied on a lot of dry shampoo. It helps if you have longer hair too because you can brush the oils down to distribute.

1317 2018-09-07 20:44:39 thank you, you mean tea tree oil?
1318 2018-09-07 20:44:38 The one thing I do wish I had taken part in is mechanics in HS I know the basics but past oil changes I know nothing. Guess I can always google it.
1319 2018-09-07 20:44:33 - Take supplements. To receive sufficient vitamins that are necessary 
- Massage your scalp. To increase blood flow and stimulate roots 
- Oil treatment. Replace moisturiser with some natural oils. For example coconut oil.
1320 2018-09-07 20:44:06 Yep. Been there, too. Our favorite was always Iberia (the little one) on Ferry St., but last few times wasn't so great. We tried Don Pepe last time there was an event at PAC and it was outstanding! Driving home in traffic after getting olive oil at Seabra's. Have a gr8 weekend!
1321 2018-09-07 20:44:02 Do yall ever put a mini oil rig on your dick right before you jizz and then screech like a cowboy about finding oil? Is that just me?
1322 2018-09-07 20:43:59 Hmm, i was under the impression no matter which party you vote for they along with the house of saud just rape countries for oil, but let's keep thinking there's a difference
1323 2018-09-07 20:43:39 My mom putting coconut oil on everything
1324 2018-09-07 20:43:28 Plus it helps us rely more on American energy.   Wind, solar, even conventional American electricity sources are a better option than purchasing oil from volatile foreign countries who don’t like us very much.  Keep American money at home.. and promote national security too.
1325 2018-09-07 20:43:23 $144 for an oil change.. 
1326 2018-09-07 20:43:12 all of the above plus fish oil and a potent grape seed extract supplement
1327 2018-09-07 20:43:08 I guess it's ok for a half-naked man to rub oil over himself for entertainment but god forbid an attractive woman walk a dart player onto stage  #CBB
1328 2018-09-07 20:43:07 When the poorest person in a rich country is middle class, it isn't bad.

You just gave $4 Billion to oil companies to build a wall to protect them from consequences of Global Warming.

Corporate welfare while Americans are homeless and starving...

1331 2018-09-07 20:42:50 To all conservatives abt to burn their @Fords. Take precautions: Fill the gas tank first because we must SUPPORT BIG OIL!

Also throw your keurig’s in there, in case you forgot, they’re evil too.

1334 2018-09-07 20:42:36 Totally agree with you, I work in the ciggy industry (non smoker I see what goes in them) the cigarette industry are on par with the cartels by cunning advertising and promotions. And people say vaping is edging cigs out, it is the same fag comp, that own, make all vape oil.
1335 2018-09-07 20:42:35 Oh shit,   I'm so glad you reminded me!    *runs out to grab more baby oil*
1336 2018-09-07 20:42:29 Lavender on the oil burner is soothing.
1337 2018-09-07 20:42:11 You gotta fry the packaged corn tortillas in two cups of vegetable oil
1338 2018-09-07 20:42:11 As you both said, there are other factors. I'm not arguing otherwise. Brazil and Chicago have gangs, higher levels of poverty, etc. But there's also Sweden, Australia, Great Britain, or Norway. They're perfectly functioning regulated countries that have very little gun violence.

1341 2018-09-07 20:41:19 I use the same exact oil! It WORKS. I use it every night
1342 2018-09-07 20:41:18 More than that. It is annual maintenance. It covers a LOT more than an oil change. Only need this 1 time a year.

1381 2018-09-07 20:35:22 Of course there are other factors, for example Chicago has gangs. It's an urban environment so there's a higher number of people and more poverty than in rural areas. There's a lot more that should be done beyond gun control, but we still need proper gun regulation, nonetheless.

1389 2018-09-07 20:33:24 @subaru_usa My local Subaru service department told me that burning 0.7 quarts of oil at 2600 miles is considered "within acceptable tolerance". This is my 8th car, 3rd Subaru, and NONE of them have burned oil like this, not even a high-mileage Ford. 2012 Impreza, 60K miles.
1390 2018-09-07 20:33:17 Nah, just use the electricity that was being used to refine oil into gasoline. Oh and use cheaper electrical soucres instead of coal, like natural gas
1391 2018-09-07 20:33:01 that is interesting - bc the india essar oil deal last month w/roseneft had many in leadership screaming it wasn't fair/hoax deal.

Oh, you don't know the cost of my praise
You don't know the cost of the oil

1500 2018-09-07 20:18:25 When it comes to the convergence of oil's centrality to global power, the desperate hunger of the Muslim world for leadership, and the Saudi monarchy's ideological tools for survival, what is actually giving way? What would fill the Sunni world's void?

1504 2018-09-07 20:17:57 There is also an attachment that will allow you to screw a standard auto oil filter on a .22 and it works good, saw a Hickok45 vid on it.
1505 2018-09-07 20:17:50 Their commitment to the cause is admirable. In spite of the complete reversal of bad fortune and replacing it with prosperity and enthusiasm, they are committed to transforming the USA into something other that what it was made by Founding Principles. Scares the hell out of me.

1518 2018-09-07 20:16:14 They don’t. Shipping consumes about 4 million barrels of fuel oil a day. Only about 25 pct of that is low sulphur fuel. To desulphurize the rest requires significant investment or blending low sulphur gasoil currently used elsewhere.
1519 2018-09-07 20:16:01 Estée Lauder has a sweat proof swim proof foundation it is in a blue tube. That stuff works like face Spackle but comes off with a mild cleanser. I use coconut oil or Shine Wipes. Then face cleanser after.

I get that they don't care about wildlife, and can't comprehend the "rights of nature," but everybody uses resources.

Which of these three pillars are actually giving way? Can the Sunni world live with a void?

Please inform us as to how much squirrel oil you have on supply.  If your neckbeard should become scratchy and distracting, I will have to keep you sitting upon the bench for those that try to stay warm.  Best of luck.  Tell your mom Goober says "hey."

1541 2018-09-07 20:12:08 My take too...nowhere in Barack Oduor's public profile does it read a ninja. This guy caused Sharon's death. You don't jump out of a speeding car and manage to run away without an injury!

1549 2018-09-07 20:10:59 So...you're essentially saying the Steelers need to give him a raise, but also use him less?  That makes no sense. Paying more for less of something is idiotic. You're buying his agent's snake oil.

1585 2018-09-07 20:06:41 The lady that works the counter where I get my oil changed just referred to the person she’s married to as her “spouse” and used they/them pronouns when referring to them 
1586 2018-09-07 20:06:26 Canada in this way is broken! Canadians have to stand up against activists with foreign interests and get our people back to work. Quit buying foreign oil, it’s not cheaper in the long run!

1623 2018-09-07 20:01:44 Rejoice with the assessment but be aware that it still takes 12 YEARS from the day of discovery until first oil is produced in this province. Compare that to places like Ghana where it takes 5 yrs from discovery to production. How can we shorten the approval process?

1634 2018-09-07 20:00:28 Want truly sustainable #palmoil in your snacks? Tell “sustainable” palm oil certifier to DROP palm oil company @Indofood > @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s business partner abuses workers & destroys #orangutan habitat
1635 2018-09-07 20:00:11 3) We are currently experiencing a slow economic growth at global level due to many reasons. Add to this issue the beginning of trade war started by Trump. Add to these two factors the concept of interruption in fossil energy (Oil & gas). Guess, What will happen?
1636 2018-09-07 20:00:11 Bullish NYMEX WTI Crude Oil bets jumped to a 4-week high as the supply risk looks real despite a build in distillate products in this week's EIA Crude Oil Inventory report
1637 2018-09-07 20:00:10 I can hardly wait until the whole world knows how absolutely destructive ObloZo was/is. 
Snake oil salesmen are better than him. #ManchurianCandidate
1638 2018-09-07 20:00:08 Snake oil salesman... and what is particularly galling is that he always was and because of that he squandered the goodwill and mandate of 1997. Thank goodness for Jeremy.
1639 2018-09-07 20:00:04 Was even going to add oil
1640 2018-09-07 20:00:01 Today I've seen my last 3 electricity bills, after I moved to a renewable energy coop from the classic electric power company... Result: The old company sold electricity at 0,15 €/kWh. The clean energy coop at 0,13 €/kWh! No coal, gas, oil & uranium = CHEAPER. I'm very glad!
1641 2018-09-07 20:00:01 Dinner: Spaghetti with Olive Oil & Garlic, Spaghetti Sauce, Bolognese Sauce, Garlic Bread, Sauteed Spinach with Garlic, Vegan/Vegetarian Bar, Hamburgers & Fries, Meat Lover's Pizza, Spicy Italian Sub, Mexican Vegetable Quesadilla, Hearty Chicken & Rice Soup
1642 2018-09-07 19:59:58 manufactured electronics and oil are really the elephants of US imports anyways
1643 2018-09-07 19:59:46 “technically I have an olive oil farm and I didn’t even realize” - bryn
1644 2018-09-07 19:59:44 You clean the parts with mineral oil? How do you do that? And do you have to wash away the oil afterwards?
1645 2018-09-07 19:59:31 Wait, musk oil or Elon Musk? Or is this some new millennial intake of the green I’m not clued in on. 
1646 2018-09-07 19:59:30 Oil based soap?
1647 2018-09-07 19:59:27 I heard cbd oil helps with that
1648 2018-09-07 19:59:25 Had a huge scare while getting an oil change that I wasn’t going to be able to make @queensofcombat tomorrow but we’re all good fam!! Just buy some extra merch from me 
1649 2018-09-07 19:59:17 I grew up in old Port Harcourt township when I speak to my friends and get first hand info on how Wike is working with “the boys” (both kidnappers, cultists and local oil bunkers) my heart bleeds
1650 2018-09-07 19:59:11 
1651 2018-09-07 19:59:04 All this time we've been supporting these companies, defending them, while they were stubbing us in the back. UNBELIEVABLE!!
No wonder they were so quiet, never standing up to govs to defend their own industry and/or our Oil Sands! My blood is boiling!!!
#cdnpoli
1652 2018-09-07 19:58:54 I would suggest baking soda and vitamin C and leaving it in over night. then do an argon oil treatment and repeat the whole thing cause it takes like 2 times. also head and shoulders takes my colour right out
1653 2018-09-07 19:58:50 Apply castor oil, you’ll grow one!
1654 2018-09-07 19:58:36 The USA is already in the arena to prepare the extraction of oil & gas prepping a leader at the right time.. watch this space ...
1655 2018-09-07 19:58:29 Why oil changes always take forever and they try to offer you everything they got.
1656 2018-09-07 19:58:27 Sooooo...this sounds like an insult to Trump's base more than an analysis of speaking styles. I'm sure that's not what YOU meant, but anyone with a minimum amount of intellect can see through Trump's lack of knowledge & his snake oil salesmen style.
1657 2018-09-07 19:58:12 While I'm sitting here waiting on my cars oil change I just realized, there is not 1 hot man in this garage like in those fake ads. 
1658 2018-09-07 19:58:10 Quebec stop taking transfer payments from Alberta amassed from people working in oil industry directly and indirectly.
1659 2018-09-07 19:58:09 Just calling around to local dispensaries to see if any of them have the vet CBD oil in stock so I can give it to my anxious cat in case you guys wanted a snapshot of my sweet life in Los Angeles
1660 2018-09-07 19:58:09 You say coconut oil and my mind automatically goes to hair care  especially those hairlines and Safaree 
1661 2018-09-07 19:58:01 Not that I can’t change my own oil... it’s just that I really don’t want to lol
1662 2018-09-07 19:57:44 Should I cop this cbd oil
1663 2018-09-07 19:57:41 But then he can't be the martyr, because he'll be taking responsibility for the failure. The story needs to be of the kindly, saintly Elon being laid low by marijuana haters, big oil, bankers, greedy short sellers and pedo cave divers. That way, he can do another scam next decade
1664 2018-09-07 19:57:40 Reason #1 why a boyfriend would come in handy right now.. I wouldn’t be waiting in line at Valvoline to have my oil changed.

1667 2018-09-07 19:57:27 She’s telling you how much she loves the smell of your beard oil.   Great picture!
1668 2018-09-07 19:57:16 We’d love nothing more. Can you help us with those gluing themselves to the apron strings? If you research the top successful innovative small countries we have more resources, tech skills & inventiveness. We’d do brilliantly. Tell our 50% you brainwashed them to waste our oil!
1669 2018-09-07 19:57:14 Soak your hands for at least 10-15 minutes in warm water with an oil based soap!
1670 2018-09-07 19:57:01 Very sad today!  Hearing of my former friends not doing good; one is prison, one may be on the way! I am struggling as well. Reading a lot!!! Beautiful book reading now; new!  A LIGHT SO LOVELY!!! Madeleine L'Engle, you bring oil to my flickering flame!!! 
#madeleinelengle
1671 2018-09-07 19:56:46 I am going to be utterly Australian and recommend eucalyptus oil for post sticker residue. Provided the cover isn’t parchment style
1672 2018-09-07 19:56:39 2) Sell the U.S. oil reserve. Highly likely we might experience some interruption in Nigerian oil fields one of these days. Folk: When it comes to fissile energy, there is highly likely a tough winter ahead of ALL OF US. (BY ALL OF US I MEAN ALL; oil producers included).
1673 2018-09-07 19:56:30 You prob only use regular oil. I have a card that lets you get an oil change for 15.95 at Ed’s tires if you wanna borrow it
1674 2018-09-07 19:56:29 Who said Kehlani squirt motor oil ?
1675 2018-09-07 19:56:12 Wow. My car takes 0w16 motor oil (yes, I had to Google it) and doesn't need an oil change for 10,000 miles. Shiny.

1677 2018-09-07 19:55:02 Oh wow! That oil filter housing is such a pain to get too
1678 2018-09-07 19:54:57 With that said acrylic is definitely much less beautiful than oil and this becomes extremely obvious when people try to use impasto techniques with acrylic
1679 2018-09-07 19:54:50 Fields are getting  washed out, it's an oil field party today in here! Awesome guys drinking and having fun. We love our oil field
1680 2018-09-07 19:54:49 Societies ultimate catch 22, Lazar, amphetamines, and oil refining, oops.  How can society like one and despise the other, when Lazar brought them both forth? Hmm..
1681 2018-09-07 19:54:48 it gets all the dead skin off of your scalp so be ready for that, and also it stimulates the oil glands (which help your hair grow & stay strong) so prep for your hair to feel a little greasier than normal but for real my hair grew like an inch in 2 weeks doing this every day
1682 2018-09-07 19:54:44 The pro-oil supporters (such as the Democratic and Republican party) hates @elonmusk because he is giving the world free electric while the oil industry continues to charge you just to drive your gas cars

#EVsAllTheWay!
1683 2018-09-07 19:54:30 This fool talking about ima drive it up a curb and show you how to change the oil 
1684 2018-09-07 19:54:23 UK has very little Oil Reserves or much else. 
What Corbyn wants is Brexit, Brexit = decimated economy.  At the same time he has a re nationalisation programme plus fund NHS & Education.  Corbyn will inherit Tories record levels of debt. Don't believe Corbyn's fairy tales
1685 2018-09-07 19:54:14 This why i fucking hate getting my oil changed  nigga been here all day
1686 2018-09-07 19:54:11 clary sage and eucalyptus oil  give me those magical breathing tools
1687 2018-09-07 19:54:05 Add ten handfuls of olive oil and take off heat.
1688 2018-09-07 19:54:01 "Scotiabank commodities economist Rory Johnston believes 'that rail is the most bets (sic) way to travel'. This is a drastic change of opinion for Johnston who has highlighted the need for additional pipeline capacity instead a reliance on oil by rail" #OOTT
1689 2018-09-07 19:54:01 I live in Alberta. I work in the oil industry with a high stake in the oil sands. I have heard nothing of the sort. Nada. Zip. Nothing. We don’t want to separate. Only a ignorant few blame the Libs since the CPC started it. Don’t start shit.

1693 2018-09-07 19:53:20 Do you use synthetic or regular oil 
1694 2018-09-07 19:53:18 Publicly Smoking weed is concerning & erratic....but secretly being prescribed pharmaceuticals is not? “Critics” are probably paid by oil companies and bigpharma. Next story please...

1696 2018-09-07 19:53:04 They didn’t par-boil these tonight. The cold to hot oil method is supposed to cook them inside well without burning them on the outside (so I’ve been told!)
1697 2018-09-07 19:53:04 usually I'm cautious about saying strife in Mideast = risk to oil but protestors in Iraq are starting on oil installations in the south. They already torched the Iranian embassy. Iraqi oil is a significant offset for the loss of Iranian oil due to sanctions. This is a real risk

1700 2018-09-07 19:52:42 Volunteers to spread soothing coconut oil all over those freshly shaved areas...
1701 2018-09-07 19:52:38 The republicans didn't lose their minds. They sold them along with their souls to Big Oil, the NRA and Putin!!!
1702 2018-09-07 19:52:35 Ok Kitchen Diva's your question for you. When you boil eggs what is the best way to keep them easy to peal. I always heard if you put oil in the water it helps. WRONG
1703 2018-09-07 19:52:09 In all likelihood it will be much more resilient than oil. Oil paintings can crack in less time than acrylic has existed
Pigment lightfastness is always the issue
Also I've never known an acrylic artist that doesnt use artist grade paint like golden
1704 2018-09-07 19:52:08 It is complicate oil problem...
1705 2018-09-07 19:52:07 A person I know out west has said that the smell of #oil spreads and ruins the air quality...

Stuff you can’t see in a picture
1706 2018-09-07 19:52:00 @AliVelshi If America worked w/our Allies to grow our independence from oil & instead subsidize Solar & Wind maybe Global Wealth will get their hands out of the #MiddleEast's Pockets so ppl can choose to have a #middleClass life in more countries- It's a better direction than War
1707 2018-09-07 19:51:47 Yeah it sucks. I had made plans to go to Lucas Oil Raceway or Putnamville on Saturday night and that's gonna get rained out. Planned on going to the Brickyard and that's gonna get rained out.

1713 2018-09-07 19:50:55 Here's the front page of the The Kent County News from this time 75 years ago. Some folks thought they might be finding oil in the Fairlee area. I'm not sure who the former resident is sounding off about it. The writing suggests an editor. #lookatthatbull
1714 2018-09-07 19:50:43 Go for avocado oil.

1719 2018-09-07 19:49:51 More of their land to the oil companies. Trump ok'd them building pipeline. And he is suppose to hold stock in the company.
1720 2018-09-07 19:49:43 you changed your oil so soon :((
1721 2018-09-07 19:49:38 Ridiculous praise.

David Young unwaveringly supports a fossil-fuel-crazed POTUS who is openly hostile to renewable energy and has packed his administration with oil and coal lobbyists.

Now Davey gets credit for trying to put out the dumpster fire he created?
1722 2018-09-07 19:49:19 Good luck. Safe travels

1726 2018-09-07 19:48:51 That thread has broad spectrum of window licking going on. They cover thicko squaddie stereotypes early on, then go through murdering for oil stuff, & then resort to memes. Do they realise that most of them are made by serving soldiers & we think they’re funny?
1727 2018-09-07 19:48:40 I wondered that too. I don't think they said so. Just seems like a whopping pan of cold oil that you bung your spuds in and leave them.

1730 2018-09-07 19:48:09 Make sure to oil and season them before smashing. Slides onto the spatula and easier to pop into your mouth when done.

1732 2018-09-07 19:47:58 I do that sometimes, also use color pencils and rub qtips with distilled turpentine to give it oil paint effect, it's super fun hahahah
But you end up kinda dizzy because... welp.... TURPENTINE.

1735 2018-09-07 19:47:37 We get it. Big oil does not like Elon Musk so he must be  slammed every damn day!
I LOVE that hes finding affordable ways to minimize fossil fuels use!
1736 2018-09-07 19:47:34 Can be true if only oil & water mixes 
1737 2018-09-07 19:47:15 The snake oil salesmen Blair himself was deployed to ease Gaddafi into the fold. Give up his weapons. Then the Manchester Jihadists, welcomed and given asylum in Britain by successive governments, were deployed. Blair was planning Syrian campaign at the same time.

1764 2018-09-07 19:44:39 That was one of my go to solutions. In a pinch, household machine oil, paraffin or wax, or even a crayon. WD40 is the best choice. Squeaks need quick attention — as in squeaky wheel getting greased.  

Hope you are doing well. 
1765 2018-09-07 19:44:39 I wonder how they handle random stuff like vegetable oil slick on the floor, fog machine, spray paint, water hose, loose AC current from extension cord; you know, the random $5 stuff found in ant store vs and $100k robot.

1768 2018-09-07 19:44:03 Never assume anything in this business, if it can be done some idiot will do it. I had an oil boiler permanent live connected to the main 60amp breaker on the fuseboard. Always double check everything before when going onto someone else's work now.

1770 2018-09-07 19:43:52 Did Jonathan not put things in place to cushion the effects of drop in oil price? Yes it did not record the same growth rate as the previous years but can you compare that growth rate and the growth rate right now? What is our growth rate right now? What is the price of oil now?
1771 2018-09-07 19:43:41 Poor Boris,he ain't no oil painting himself but he's been in with some right grimmers down the years.

1774 2018-09-07 19:43:29 I do not understand why you consider this snake oil salesman hypocritically bashing Republicans of crimes and atrocities his admin did as news. Much other accurate news need 2b reported. Are you trying to loose viewers or compete 4

1776 2018-09-07 19:43:22 Every barrel of oil that is burned, every clean energy alternative underinvested in, every dollar of fossil fuel subsidy signifies, in the final sense, a theft from the hungry and the sick, and from their descendants even more so

1783 2018-09-07 19:42:19 They've already lost. Lost healthcare. Lost environmental protections. Lost freedom due to mega oil pipelines.
1784 2018-09-07 19:42:15 @AndrewBellBNN The Trans Mountain discussion minimizes the fact that #climatechange is happening much faster than scientists have projected. If we dig the oil someone will burn it. Business as usual = an uninhabitable earth and destroy our kids future but that is being ignored.

1788 2018-09-07 19:41:52 My 01 ranger went 10 years, and my stupid self only had the oil changed a few times.  Would probably still be going if I had taken any kind of care of it.  Lesson learned, anyway.

1796 2018-09-07 19:40:20 The Modi Govt should have come out with a white paper on the economy...the NPA mess the previous Govt had created and now  the oil bonds. And the man who perfected the art of bathing with a raincoat has the temerity to launch a broadside?
1797 2018-09-07 19:40:17 Its disappointing. As a combat veteran that needs CBD oil every day for anxiety, the media continues to demonize the plant for clicks.

It makes it hard for ppl like me to live without fear of being judged harshly just for the medicine I take.

When will this stigma end?
1798 2018-09-07 19:40:10 Try CBD oil! My mother inlaw uses it, as do many others. It works :)

1800 2018-09-07 19:40:06 My two cents worth...police should investigate the @dailynation journalist. If the 'big man' killed Sharon, the journalist caused the death. He must have smelled cash cow in the story.
1801 2018-09-07 19:40:02 Trump and his supporters are delusional. 
He is a snake oil salesman as you suggest, but his non-thinking supporters keep buying the snake oil.
1802 2018-09-07 19:39:52 paying for an oil change <<< but its not even that much compared to other cars

1806 2018-09-07 19:39:24 Right so people should vote for a party who doesn't have their interests at heart, is pro war lied about no longer taking money from oil companies. A party who during the Obama administration used the espionage act to trial more journalist then any other.

1816 2018-09-07 19:38:08 Pulling out of Iranian deal hurt the oil industry. That was trump's action. Ignoring the facts doesn't change reality.

In as much as I believe @segalink wants the lesson to be noted. History should also be set straight.

1838 2018-09-07 19:35:06 India’s foreign exchange reserves fell by $1.191 billion. Surge in oil prices is further adding to current account deficit. RBI must stop spending dollars defending the rupee. Some other options must be implemented to control the currency depreciation.
1839 2018-09-07 19:35:04 Something else that would calm her down is lavender oil (essential oil) if you have access to it. Put it on something near her. I have to put it on a towel one of mine sleeps near. He likes to raise the roof all night if I don't use some.

1850 2018-09-07 19:33:45 Well, my gut feeling is that US want to keep Levant hot, to cut CN out of oil supplies and make one of #OBOR corridors useless, but try to delegate most of this mess to allies, like IL&AS.

1870 2018-09-07 19:31:42 For acne try teatree oil (natural) or benzoyl peroxide (chemical) as far as spot treatment. Any kind of face scrub with sacylic acid will help, too, but will eventually dry your skin out

1885 2018-09-07 19:30:18 Why wouldnt we be. The ones that find terrorism have been removed. Saudi is our ally and will likely taken over the ME . We are out of the oil wars now
1886 2018-09-07 19:30:04 blame the ones who caused this. If Iran wasn't dangerous,and a threat then it wouldn't be a problem,now they are a threat to all Nations,keeping them from from transporting oil.Guess ur sol.

1902 2018-09-07 19:28:03 U.S. Marines, stationed on high alert, were given the order to invade the small oil rich nation.
1903 2018-09-07 19:27:48 Wait, didn’t Germany sign a multi billion $$ deal to buy oil from Russia??
1904 2018-09-07 19:27:34 We choose an oil or oil blend every month to educate our team on and dub it the oil of the month :-)
1905 2018-09-07 19:27:28 As you say Christopher, grazing is less inefficient. I'm not even going to address margarine and canola oil. We have completely different nutritional and overall worldviews. Good luck with with your inflammation.
1906 2018-09-07 19:27:26 Well substitute for thinly cut spring onions...and good olive oil!
1907 2018-09-07 19:27:15 The Obama administration was the most corrupt era in history.  He’s a snake oil salesman!  No thank you!  We will stay the course!

1911 2018-09-07 19:27:06 It is oil in ND, and, yes, the price is back up. Way up.
1912 2018-09-07 19:27:06 Peppermint oil is freaking bommmmbbbbbbb  for headaches 
1913 2018-09-07 19:27:02 @elonmusk Listening to you on JRE. You mentioned that your electric VTOL idea wasn't as important as electric cars.

My idea is to turn the US govt vehicles into ones that don't use gasoline. Cars, trucks, tanks, planes - biggest obstacles is govt. Deeply dependant on oil.
1914 2018-09-07 19:26:58 fundamentally opposing viewpoints.

We are oil and water! Yes, in something’s we can concede to the other side in the interest of America.

But not things like the lies like which Obama spouted today... accusing the right of foolishly going into debt 1.3 Trillion while giving...
1915 2018-09-07 19:26:57 I think it’s neutrogena that has a really good spot treatment as well in a grey squeeze tube. But yea chemical exfoliation is the truth. Just don’t wanna over dry your skin and produce more oil

1917 2018-09-07 19:26:29 Perhaps you don't understand much about Iran's role in the oil industry..
1918 2018-09-07 19:26:19 National debate with MaunMunim ji who needs permission fm #MafiaMata & Pappu @RahulGandhi to even utter a word? Incompetent disgrace to nation, MMS spoilt economy on ALL fronts, incl. running up Oil import bills of ₹2.7L Cr & dirty rotten scoundrel has audacity to blame NaMo? 
1919 2018-09-07 19:25:37 Out of shaving cream? No problem. Use olive oil instead (plus it smells good!)
1920 2018-09-07 19:25:27 I feel that way when ppl add oil to their pasta water.
1921 2018-09-07 19:25:20 That makes a lot of sense.
I’m still a bit biased towards looking at oil producers as far as visits go, despite having gotten out of the petrol area years ago.
1922 2018-09-07 19:25:19 I have a fear of frying things and getting hot oil on me
1923 2018-09-07 19:25:14 What does CBD Oil do?
1924 2018-09-07 19:25:07 I will make myself the owner of all oil wells and blocks in the country.

1932 2018-09-07 19:24:00 zinc, vitamin B & fish oil are good supplements to take to increase your appetite

1935 2018-09-07 19:23:29 Trudeaus most important relationship is with the multi-national corporations. Especially the oil & gas side of it.
1936 2018-09-07 19:23:21 @spectatorindex Oil price needed to balance budget.

Diesel pe chalne wali industries ko furnace oil per shift kerwaye
1938 2018-09-07 19:22:46 The best purchases I made for my face are Micellar water and Sheth Naturals rose water oil..
1939 2018-09-07 19:22:37 Idt this is going to work for forcing people's hand to vote for the next corporate shill the Democrats run in 2020 Seth, I think your energies would be better spent trying to support a principled progressive who doesn't leak baggage at the aggressive rate of a BP oil pipeline.
1940 2018-09-07 19:22:35 PSA new paltz hipsters: ditch the patchouli, buy real deodorant not that fake ass toms shit, get some damn lavender soap, rub some almond oil on ya dry ass and stop wearing potatoe sacks for dresses. sincerely, a brown queen
1941 2018-09-07 19:22:24 Amazing some people see this vast conspiracy amongst volunteers and vastly under-funded PhDs making $30K a year, yet are oblivious to trillion-dollar oil company lies peddled by CEOs making billions.
1942 2018-09-07 19:22:10 Ai women are heartless... They open your chest with a ice pick.. Cut your heart with a spoon.. Deep fry it in motor oil.. N turn around n say.. "you are a good guy" fuck you
1943 2018-09-07 19:22:07  they are forcing me to fight for Twitter oil on a land I dont own. Kareh gohota atia mani 
1944 2018-09-07 19:21:55 People get democracy shamed by Democrats for voting for the green party. Hard to not vote green when you're anti war and pro environment. Meanwhile Democrats are pro war and pro oil and fracking
1945 2018-09-07 19:21:50 I don’t know what’s the name of this oil stuff babe uses but it makes the house smell heavenly I’m try put y’all on game so your joint can stop smelling like stale cigs blunts and socks and food
1946 2018-09-07 19:21:40 Today I read that Nike will start to dabble in the food industry. Apparently they plan on using scraped then modified oil from the skin of their workers as a substitute to rapeseed and palm oil.
1947 2018-09-07 19:21:37 Congrats Wickens! Future Indycar champ!

1952 2018-09-07 19:20:57 Coconut oil? If you use enough, it makes scraping the kale into the bin so much easier
1953 2018-09-07 19:20:35 As anyone with eyes can see, the Average American, as well as the American Native, has been loosing a lot! Native Americans can look at their rights concerning the oil pipelines going through their lands. Most people have lost a lot with Trump.
1954 2018-09-07 19:20:25 My prediction of what will happen if Trump actually tries to cause the “ruination” of Canada: He will try to stop US imports of Canadian oil, since that’s the only way he could put a dent in the Canadian economy. Trump will double our gas prices to give Canada a bloody nose

1968 2018-09-07 19:18:12 Screw @SecretaryZinke he isn’t doing anything that won’t help oil and gas. He is only doing this for them not sportsmen. Don’t get it twisted.
1969 2018-09-07 19:18:11 The oil slick of violence is oozing its way to every corner of London.
1970 2018-09-07 19:18:09 What about synthetic oil? And you’ve really sold me if I can be in and out within an hour when I visit 
1971 2018-09-07 19:18:00 Yeah... expanded oil production to highest ever, failed to prosecute bakers that crashed the economy, failed to bail out Americans and bailed out banks instead, expanded to 7 wars, gave us romney care, opened DNC to lobbyists, put DWS in charge, lost almost all Democrat's power.
1972 2018-09-07 19:17:59 Oh the cognitive dissonance between Russia and the oil companies.
1973 2018-09-07 19:17:54 Dropped my car off for an oil change and I miss her already 
1974 2018-09-07 19:17:51 3/Among them are H. L. Hunt (you possibly know his background), a few other Texas oil millionaires, and an occasional politician or business man from other areas. Their number is negligible and they are stupid." -Eisenhower.

1983 2018-09-07 19:16:39 My oil change took less tome than I thought so I went ahead and drove to work. Now to wait in my car for 15 minutes bzmdjdje
1984 2018-09-07 19:16:38 Of course, either he's gay or he's super drunk he doesn't know what he's doing, it's the only explanation

If it was me I'd be asking to excuse myself, that lady got a nice caboose and the fact that it's all drizzled with oil just made it worse
1985 2018-09-07 19:16:36 A healthy vagina cleans itself. End of story. Anything else is snake oil.
1986 2018-09-07 19:16:36 Keep your feeling inside you till the upcoming election at that time don't sell it for 20rs. 
In my opinion next election petroleum minister criteria MBA or doctracte in oil & gas . Likewise criteria to be fixed for each ministry ..what I say is minimum ..
1987 2018-09-07 19:16:36 Eliminate all oil. Olive oil isn't a healthy option. It is still pure fat. Leave the (highest provider of cholesterol in the American diet) egg whites out as well.

1991 2018-09-07 19:16:16 PS Mærsk er teknisk set ikke en olieproducent længere. De har solgt Maersk Oil fra til Total.
1992 2018-09-07 19:16:09 Exactly what I was going to ask. The cost of everything is on the rise thanks to Trump's tariff wars and verbal attacks on Iran causing fear on Wall St., increasing the cost of oil.
1993 2018-09-07 19:16:06 I am never going by myself to get my oil changed again
1994 2018-09-07 19:16:05 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
1995 2018-09-07 19:15:59 Been an hour now. Been waiting on dealship to handle my vans oil change
1996 2018-09-07 19:15:59 No more "evidence" than hundreds of science fiction writers concocting stories about extraterrestrial aliens is " evidence" they are real.
1997 2018-09-07 19:15:57 Haha I was just waking by this with a group of peeps walking towards me. I said, y’all, I’m heading down to one of the restaurants to get 30 gallons of oil. Meet me back here in 10 minutes for slip n slides!! They died 
1998 2018-09-07 19:15:46 my car out here taking 100$ oil changes hoe 
1999 2018-09-07 19:15:40 if u ever do use oils again, I would recommend using sansodor, gamsol, or linseed oil as an alternative solvent :-)
2000 2018-09-07 19:15:38 Then they give you a swig of drink, for this $60 oil change I need a 2 liter 
2001 2018-09-07 19:15:30 Elon is a snake oil salesmen

2003 2018-09-07 19:15:23 Lindsey! You liar! 2009 major recession due to bush and fake need go to war. Which was actually oil. President Obama dug is out of that mess. Your partisan ways are anti-American. Why do you hate poor people so much?
2004 2018-09-07 19:15:21 (Looks up FML)
I would take you up on that offer if I wasn't waiting on an oil change and on my way to work.
2005 2018-09-07 19:14:59 And those Americans have learned absolutely nothing.  They STILL live for conspiracy theories, alternative facts & disinformation.  We’re onto #QAnon now.  Only God knows what nonsense they will fall for next! 

That’s how we got Trump...a snake oil salesman!
2006 2018-09-07 19:14:58 Now taking my baby to get oil change 
2007 2018-09-07 19:14:57 Since you need an answer, I will give you..  Ur  pmb is the worst president ever in the history of Nigeria. Even in the past same thing; a man once said "pmb head no get oil".the present is zero.  He scored 0/100 in integrity. U needed attention frm 9ja u got it. Congrats
2008 2018-09-07 19:14:44 The oil change people know they be tryna hustle you, I do not need windshield wipers sir 
2009 2018-09-07 19:14:29 Oil him up, put him in a chariot, and let him ride around San Francisco
2010 2018-09-07 19:14:29 On their taxes.
Which is the what pays for our healthcare.
We are not a rich country like the US. Nor do we have unlimited oil money like let's say Saudi Arabia.
It scares me what will happen in the next 10-20 yrs & if I will just have die bc I won't have access to it.
2011 2018-09-07 19:14:11 Just a girl who saw a gap in the beard oil market in South Africa. A daddies girl an engineer
2012 2018-09-07 19:13:47 WebMD, which is not a reliable source of information, supports oil pulling. Eye roll. Why do people think WebMD has quality medical info? It is loaded with false claims and outright pseudoscience.
2013 2018-09-07 19:13:32 He's working on it right now... ready to start pushing that organic snake oil.
2014 2018-09-07 19:13:28 Found vape oil that tastes like alfalfa. Anyone who's driven between Sacramento and Fresno on hot summer nights know what I mean and how the livestock weed swells your nostrils and throat with a different dank.
2015 2018-09-07 19:13:17 @ainosruiz : ..rumor has it he puts his whole arm in the boiling oil & takes out las carnitas. 
Ashley: stfu
Vicki: **in deep concentration** I don’t even remember his arms.
2016 2018-09-07 19:13:17 The tent isn’t fuel.  To make products with oil isn’t the same as lighting it on fire.
2017 2018-09-07 19:13:13 Russia has only ever depended on oil prices for gdp. Prior to the Soviet Union that whole region was nothing but impoverished peasants. Lets not get started on the Irish. 

Point here is that there is plenty to tar countries with white populations, as with countries of other race
2018 2018-09-07 19:13:05 Sjoe, Well done. Your skin really does look proper.  

But let's get to the shine bright like a diamond part.

Is that baby oil?
2019 2018-09-07 19:12:58 A drop of hot oil fell on my foot. Perfecttoooo

2022 2018-09-07 19:12:16 @ProfGaines #BIL150 Omega fatty acids are a type of essential fatty acid found in fish oil and act to lower LDL and cholesterol. I think the remote lecture worked well because we were still able to ask questions and see the PowerPoints. (Isabel Brett)
2023 2018-09-07 19:12:15 Exactly, if you don’t know how to change your oil, you pay someone to do it for you because you lack that skill set. Why is it any different for paying for someone’s creative ability
2024 2018-09-07 19:12:09 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2025 2018-09-07 19:12:07 Oh joy I love waiting for a hour and a half to get my oil changed on the Nissan. At they have good coffee
2026 2018-09-07 19:12:04 What's more, many Indian refiners are configured to process Iranian oil — this means they can't switch to other suppliers easily. 2/2
2027 2018-09-07 19:12:01 In an attempt to cling onto its trading partners, Iran is providing significantly cheaper oil than any of its competitors, as well as offering extended credit terms and practically free shipping. Its proximity to India also helps reduce transport costs. 1/2
2028 2018-09-07 19:11:36 I got a free oil change and two new tires all for being nice to people and smiling. Idk how y’all do this 9-5 shit.

2033 2018-09-07 19:10:49 The countries around us are selling cheaper to consumer. But the client they get oil is also the same for us and them. People should start asking questions. its insane even when we put petrol we look for zero alone but have you checked the meter final reading ,compare it oth bunk

2036 2018-09-07 19:10:05 One of the simple home remedies for body odor is to put a few drops of rose water or tea tree oil in the bathtub, before taking bath.

2039 2018-09-07 19:09:32 Ontario sees biggest decline in jobs, while Alberta gains 16,200. Interesting that you dont mention positive Alberta news. Seems Notleys economy is going ok, considering that she couldn't rely on Oil as previous PC governments had the luxury of doing. Could UCP do this?NO.
2040 2018-09-07 19:09:17 All the more reason that we should make Canada self sufficient with its own oil.
2041 2018-09-07 19:09:14 How about not giving it away for free. Sex is not a relationship.
2042 2018-09-07 19:09:12 Olive oil for kini???
2043 2018-09-07 19:09:06 Forbes rated our economy as one of the best performing economies despite a huge drop in oil price which is our main source of revenue from $170 - $155 to less than  $50 per barrel.

2049 2018-09-07 19:08:23 アイリーンの裏の顔が…！
2050 2018-09-07 19:08:11 This country is not united or working anymore. Liberals need to champion Alberta's resources not demonize it. They are more then happy buying oil from countries who have no or very little human rights.
2051 2018-09-07 19:08:06 I’ve been using bio oil for years now but have just run out so wasn’t sure wether to repurchase or try another brand xx
2052 2018-09-07 19:08:03 Some of us know that. Unfortunately a good portion of the country is infected with liberalism. Depending on how bad Trump destroys sock boy on NAFTA you’ll see a movement by western provinces (Alberta) to seceed. He couldn’t care less about the west and oil industry.
2053 2018-09-07 19:07:57 He is bragging about the Dakota pipeline. Is he going to brag about the 200,000 gallons of spilled oil?
2054 2018-09-07 19:07:43 Prime example of when SCOTUS gets it wrong.
Striking down the law would have saved the country from effects of poorly written law and perhaps resulted in more effective reform.
Are we stuck bcse left considers this settled law?
2055 2018-09-07 19:07:29 that hot oil treatment got my hair feeling amazing
2056 2018-09-07 19:07:08 First Muslim president was he biggest snake oil sale.

2061 2018-09-07 19:05:27 I wash my face with my ABS 2x daily, tone with my homemade rice water (helps with large pores and hyperpigmentation) and moisturize with grape seed oil. I exfoliate 3/4 times a week with rice flour.
2062 2018-09-07 19:05:27 He's bragging about the Dakota pipeline is he gonna brag about the 200,000 gallons of spilled oil too?
2063 2018-09-07 19:05:27 Venezuela's problems come from oil money dependency, U.S economic sanctions, corruption, transnationals and capitalists sabotaging the country, and the Atlantic Council plan for economic collapse. What would happen if the US received sanctions over war crimes?
2064 2018-09-07 19:05:26 Helll nah....na oil na
2065 2018-09-07 19:05:18 ‘Central casting.’ Hates Hollywood ‘elites’ but he implies he’s one of them. He’s a snake oil salesman within a crime family.
2066 2018-09-07 19:05:15 Only been vaping cbd oil for about 2 days. But I can already tell a huge difference! It’s crazy ! I should have started this a long time ago !
2067 2018-09-07 19:05:11 @realDonaldTrump This damaging oil of the Iranian regime should be completely cut off by November 4th
2068 2018-09-07 19:05:07 Yah after draining the oil...
2069 2018-09-07 19:05:07 It wasn't just Hillary's bad campaign. She was a corporate Democrat and was for the big Banks, Wall Street,Big Oil. If you're going to vote Republican ideals anyway you might as well go with the Republican that might give you something IE Trump. I think most people can see that.

2072 2018-09-07 19:04:48 @realDonaldTrump I swear to God never to retreat a single step in the full oil boycott, I hope that the American people will always be with us, this terrorism evil must be cleared out of the land, that war must be ended and that the peace that everyone desires is fulfilled
2073 2018-09-07 19:04:47 I have started using a vape pen with CBD oil in it. Be careful when purchasing CBD though. People will try and confuse you as to how much CBD is actually in the bottle.

2076 2018-09-07 19:04:24 Lol.
2077 2018-09-07 19:04:21 Well duh. we knew all along that big Oil needed more than one pipeline. We got the first clue when they switched the old TCP from natural gas to tar sludge. Then they 'needed a new Natural Gas pipeline - with some oil in the same right of way.
2078 2018-09-07 19:04:19 CBD oil has less than .03% THC-d9. It does NOT get you high.

It simply offers a ton of health benefits. And its legal literally everywhere else (the other 49 states).
2079 2018-09-07 19:04:12 People don’t realize that the democratic and republican parties are different sides of the same thing. Women’s rights, abortion, racism & all things we disagree with doesn’t affect the 1%.  Big oil is one of their entities which is why obama never helped “water is life”
2080 2018-09-07 19:04:09 Right then we got Putin for President.. how much oil u in it for Mr. Graham???
2081 2018-09-07 19:03:55 Well besides that it's a comedogenic oil, I don't see much cons about coconut oil
2082 2018-09-07 19:03:46 ok time to go be an adult and go get the car oil changed.

2091 2018-09-07 19:03:08 For me, it was John and Greg’s amazement that she managed to fry some prawns in oil with chopped up garlic and chilli... complex.

2092 2018-09-07 19:02:50 The next time you get gas or oil for your car remember these are the people you are contributing to. The Kochs, all big oil playing "wag the dog." Keeping chaos going and using the ignorant. They control your life, the media, the government, and a tin horn dictator.
2093 2018-09-07 19:02:32 Twitter and different opinions mix like water and oil lol
2094 2018-09-07 19:02:17 Awesome I love your thoughts , and agree 100 % Last year I changed everything I eat do . Started yoga, take apple cider vinegar everyday, lavender essential oil spry for sleeping . Lost 25 pounds and counting natural is the best way !
2095 2018-09-07 19:02:03 But of course: S'pore would love to continue looting Burma of its gas, oil, timber, sand, elephant tusks, real estate, you name it...
All under the pretext of Asean cooperation...
2096 2018-09-07 19:01:51 israel must F off. It's Syria. I give a  about Murdochs oil investments there.
2097 2018-09-07 19:01:40 Does this dream include coconut oil and me dragon slaying? Because if not.. Goodbye. You can do anything in your dreams. Don’t put me in a trash ass situation.
2098 2018-09-07 19:01:31 An additional 6 or 7 oil tankers versus thousands of other craft which also create the problem of noise for killer whales, although undoubtedly the problem is more than just that.

2101 2018-09-07 19:01:12 i overclocked it. gotta keep it in a vat of oil now. kinda inconveniet but my gamerscore is soaring
2102 2018-09-07 19:00:44 Agreed....
2103 2018-09-07 19:00:41 Like you wouldn’t be trying to use hash based olive oil substitute
2104 2018-09-07 19:00:37 The new snake oil has it's sales force
2105 2018-09-07 19:00:35 Must have picked up some dialect after  peddling all that snake oil
2106 2018-09-07 19:00:32 Pochettino is the best coach Tottenham had had in 50 years, but they're still very much the underdog to this Man City team, with all the oil money of Qatar behind it.

But if it came easy, it wouldn't be nearly as fun.

2111 2018-09-07 19:00:17 "why do they think these policies will work now?"

Because Fallin hasn't done anything for anyone except the oil companies. Something HAS to change. Those of you who repeat your straight party ticket votes are doomed to see this state slip further and further away from salvation.

2121 2018-09-07 18:59:51 No way. You can cut a steak in elegance.
2122 2018-09-07 18:59:45 In total, there is a combined resource potential of 49.2 billion barrels of oil and 193.8 trillion cubic feet of gas in less than seven per cent of our offshore. (2/2)

2129 2018-09-07 18:58:55 DIY essential oil products -air fresheners, cleaners, etc. and put them in glass bottles or reuse plastic spray bottles you have. Buying the oils originally may be expensive but you’ll have them for a long time, get many uses, and not have to buy store bought products anymore.
2130 2018-09-07 18:58:49 People are so depressed + exhausted.  T is creating an atmosphere where people. don't know what to do or who to believe.

2131 2018-09-07 18:58:49 DMV, oil change, fuel system cleaner, emissions test and prescription pickup. That's enough adulting for today. Time to smoke that loud.

2139 2018-09-07 18:57:53 Honestly if you have bunged up sinuses, boil water put it into a big bowl with some olbas oil or vapour rub. Put your head over the bowl and a towel over the top and steam your face, best thing ever!!!

2147 2018-09-07 18:57:08 My favorite part is when people demanded that they should be consulted in how "our," oil is distributed. Almost like consultation is important and means something.
2148 2018-09-07 18:56:58 All arguments r only stupidity, thing is govt is happy as more the prices of Oil more Texas they will collect. As taxes is % of oil prices. They r not concerned about our hardship. From BJP voter.

2151 2018-09-07 18:56:26 That is what this Republican Party would like than the cattle ranchers can take over more land & the big oil companies can drill,they are literally destroying the American landscape & once these great icons are gone they will never return.Stop them now
2152 2018-09-07 18:56:12 il problema della generazione Erasmus e' che non sanno di non sapere, pontificano urbi et orbi senza cognizione di causa in un delirio di superomismo del nulla.

2153 2018-09-07 18:56:12 putting tea tree oil on a bug bite on my face before class was probably the worst decisions ever, the smell is making people look at me like a squirrel aboutta pop outta my hair
2154 2018-09-07 18:56:09 What fucking ape put the oil filter on my MX-5? It's supposed to be hand tight and 2 hours later I'm still fighting at it, even with a dedicated tool.
2155 2018-09-07 18:56:03 Man listen. People used to come to me for an oil change and would leave with wipers, brake flush, trans flush and a alignment. That’s about 800 dollars 
2156 2018-09-07 18:56:02 Going for an oil change and a tire rotation today. Can’t wait to find out my Jeep has 3 weeks to live.
2157 2018-09-07 18:55:56 Hoping everyone at the press conference today is taking their vitamins, cause if not there's a good chance I just gave a big chunk of the province's oil and gas leadership a cold.
2158 2018-09-07 18:55:51 What’s oil of the month?
2159 2018-09-07 18:55:44 Agreed and @realDonaldTrump  Please stand up for yourself, we need you. Declassify the documents today.

2162 2018-09-07 18:55:36 Just the thought of olive oil makes me want to run away and hide.
2163 2018-09-07 18:55:32 Yes under this current gov this is how it’s working, is it the right way? Absolutely not! Given the circumstances as has happened in the past when Pierre Trudeau was in power Alberta had no choice but use extreme pressure, cut off their resources oil and gas
2164 2018-09-07 18:55:29 A baseless claim against Kavenaugh but your essentially right. Koskinen, Brennan, Clapper, Holder, Lynch et al.

2169 2018-09-07 18:54:59 Great customer service today from @Halfords_uk in Wells. Had to have assistance to fill up my oil in my work car after struggling to open the engine bonnet - not my finest hour!   
2170 2018-09-07 18:54:57 we don't need dirty tarsands muck for tents. we don't need dirty tarsands muck to transition away from fossil fuels. we don't need the dirtiest form of oil extraction to divest. and most of all, we don't need this tired old discredited argument getting rerun by has-beens like you
2171 2018-09-07 18:54:52 Apparently they don’t understand what CBD oil is.

2176 2018-09-07 18:54:23 Just fry it a bit in olive oil or margarine, spread a thin layer of cream cheese (optional), spread a bit of sauce, add the ingredients you want and finally sprinkle a bit of shredded cheese and heat until it melts. Enjoy.

2179 2018-09-07 18:53:44 Sue did you get the Omega oil a couple of weeks back from wishlist? I only ask to make sure it was delivered safe and sound....was my 1st time donating from there....
2180 2018-09-07 18:53:34 India’s number one strategic ally isn’t United States, it is Israel, at whose behest even the former flexes its muscles. Indian establishment would have long factored in halting oil purchase from Iran.

2207 2018-09-07 18:51:25 Sure, but the oil & gold markets are regulated such that the SEC is comfortable in (1) its ability to detect & prosecute manipulation and (2) the minimal impact of manipulation on ETF prices, given the size of the markets.

You can agree or not, but I think that's the SEC's view.

2214 2018-09-07 18:50:46 Canadians are not green. Oil Sands crude is the most environmentally unfriendly for transportation as well as for its extraction methods. That should be the issue and it is for 1st Nations and BC. The Whales need food(chinook salmon in short supply) and less Whale Watch boats.

2221 2018-09-07 18:49:41 The #WTI and #brent spread is about $9 / bbl. This is a direct reflection of the increase in oil  production in the USA and related pipeline  infrastructure constraints. US refiners must be happy.
2222 2018-09-07 18:49:19 Maybe she has a hygiene problem.
2223 2018-09-07 18:49:17 .@CNBC We have already hit the key tipping point where new solar/wind are cheaper than new coal plants.

Coal is effectively finished as an energy source - as of 2016, the top 4 US producers lost 99% value in 5 years.

Gas & oil are on the same path.
2224 2018-09-07 18:49:13 Also include the deliberate stonewalling and outright prevention of creating the XL pipeline from ALBT to Texas.

And recall the more recent Montreal mayor, and former LPC cabinet minister,Denis Coderre, who refused ALBT  oil to run east to NS lamely citing environmental reasons.

I'm just a dude asking questions, not planning to shake any tables.
2231 2018-09-07 18:48:29 Thanks, glad to have you my good sir. And if I could predict oil prices as well as I could predict geopolitics I'd have already bought a small island in the South Pacific by now. Then I'd take a loan out from China to build a palatial compound and default on the debt. #winning

Of course Russia is helping Syria to secure oil trading but so what? If they help people, it's not a travesty.
2243 2018-09-07 18:47:33 Don’t buy products that contain palm oil, people. That industry is destroying the jungle and your cardiovascular system.

2246 2018-09-07 18:47:11 Definitely need some track variation. For example Xfinity and trucks previously ran Indy Lucas Oil now Xfinity race Indy. I’m sure expensive modifications to cars cost owners for this race.
2247 2018-09-07 18:47:08 @SenWhitehouse Superb point: Applying mens rea, intent to do the crime to big business, for example big business Supreme Court could decide Exon doesn't have to pay for oil spill as they did have the mens rea or intent to spill oil. No wonder Orrin Hatch is so worried about it.
2248 2018-09-07 18:47:04 .@CNBC No one owes you a market. Much less a toxic, $3 trillion+/year revenue stream that is killing the planet.

So, oil with an effective cap of $25/barrel or lower vs solar & natural gas that are practically free.
2249 2018-09-07 18:46:54 I have done that with a frying pan.. I wanted five minutes for the oil to heat up so I could fry my eggs but I hadn’t lit the hob. Plot twist, I HAD turned the gas on..
2250 2018-09-07 18:46:51 If it was gas or oil America wanted we wouldn't have lost so many troops,  we could have just taken it from mexico or Canada who can't defend themselves, but you keep telling yourself how the white hats were the good guys and obama giving them millions was ok.

2273 2018-09-07 18:44:58 That would be like saying that $BTC supply is inelastic and assume that regardless it's price, miners would sell anyways. I also disagree and think that after reaching certain price point, miners would hoard (like in commodity markets, ie, Oil)

2297 2018-09-07 18:41:52 I know by Nigerian outdated standards you are smart, but in the 2018 economics, GDP is not used to measure richness exclusively, there is HDI. Secondly, oil has a ripple effect in other economic sectors which you are excluding.
But let me agree am dumb. Case closed

2300 2018-09-07 18:41:50 Sometimes. I'll mist with coconut oil, and sometimes instead of using curl cream, I use a daub of conditioner. But the issue with the bangs being dry and lifeless is new as of 48 hours ago, so I may need to change what I'm doing.

2307 2018-09-07 18:41:18 The oil has an effect yes, but as the GDP suggests, it contributes little. We have far  More natural resources we could earned more from, but the oil is a lazy economy.
2308 2018-09-07 18:41:15 What about “men being able to use women’s bathrooms”, and “shaking down BP over oil spill”.. that’s all I remember..
2309 2018-09-07 18:41:14 Lee's special with everything, hot peppers, mayo. No oil
2310 2018-09-07 18:41:11 I eat dead animal flesh everyday to reduce their impact on the environment. Sometimes multiple times a day. I believe that because they ate plants I get my plant vitamins by eating the animals.
2311 2018-09-07 18:41:08 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
2312 2018-09-07 18:41:08 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
2313 2018-09-07 18:40:59 Dear Modiji - kindly declare,execute, your decision of not importing oil for next 15 days  urge entire country  to use only public transport, car pooling,SHARE autos,taxis,bike,etc TO STRENGTHEN INR AND HIT USD, ONLY YOU AS A LEAFER HAD AGUTS TO DO THIS IN WORLD
2314 2018-09-07 18:40:56 What oil have you been using? I want to introduce myself to one.
2315 2018-09-07 18:40:44 Hi Williker. Your pizza with extra cheese and motor oil will be delivered in 27 min via air balloon.
2316 2018-09-07 18:40:38 I done literally tried everything but castor oil  and I’m not doing that 
2317 2018-09-07 18:40:33 TODAY is EXACTLY 109 days to CHRISTMAS 
1. Get a box(kolo)
2. Put N500 daily 
3. Open it on December 23 and you’ll have N54,500 as savings. It will be enough to buy Rice, oil & chicken, drinks.
Thank me later

2320 2018-09-07 18:40:21 It is what it is of course, direct it to them,I have directed my message and advice to him as a friend
2321 2018-09-07 18:40:15 Assume oil is at 100 with 10% tax. So tax collection is 10. Now oil moved to 200. The choice is to still collect 10 now at 5% rate or 20 at old 10%. An arrogant govt may keep 10% rate but a smart govt may reduce it to 7-8% and still benefit from price hike

2325 2018-09-07 18:40:01 It is a normal thing brother. Thanks to GOD that the person found you worthy to ask; they know you got their back. There is always another time.
2326 2018-09-07 18:39:52 I can make gigantic omelettes with vegetables and hot sauce and olive oil spray and it doesn't even count. Add a little cheese and eat it with toast, and I have a huge meal that costs me a fraction of a bowl of cereal. #diet
2327 2018-09-07 18:39:51 Don't spend all day prepping for your roasting veggies. Try Pictsweet Farms vegetable for roasting. Salt,pepper ,oil and 20 minutes is all it takes for delicious roasted veggies.  #GotItFree #PictsweetFree #LetsRoast #RoastEmUp
2328 2018-09-07 18:39:49 Yes they do but since the US$ remains the world reserve currency
other countries have basically no choice but to own Dollars since Oil and metals are all pegged in USD. Treasuries 4 them is not an investment its a very liquid parking place.
2329 2018-09-07 18:39:46 Dear Modiji - kindly declare,execute, your decision of not importing oil for next 15 days  urge entire country  to use only public transport, car pooling,SHARE autos,taxis,bike,etc TO STRENGTHEN INR AND HIT USD, ONLY YOU AS A LEAFER HAD AGUTS TO DO THIS IN WORLD

2332 2018-09-07 18:39:34 Wow . I hate being myself . It took me 6 places to find someone to find someone to change my oil which was on 5% . I’m hot im bothered my hormones are all over the place & ive had 3 44oz wawa cups of water & my bladder is about to explode but I don’t use public restrooms 
2333 2018-09-07 18:39:25 @realDonaldTrump  The pipeline construction jobs you are bragging about are temporary. Perhaps those workers will get rehired to clean up the inevitable spills? Instead of a plan to develop good paying permanent jobs, Repubs make oil billionaires richer & destroy our environment.
2334 2018-09-07 18:39:22 ไม่กลับบ้านนานแค่ใหนแล้ว. เป็นห่วงย่าจัง
2335 2018-09-07 18:39:21 Too right, and I think these issues shouldn't be clouded with religion or any other excuse. They'll try to make it about religion or oil or foreign policy, but really, we're just not turning a blind eye
2336 2018-09-07 18:38:32 Right away senior engineer, check your whatsapp
2337 2018-09-07 18:38:21 Who wrote on oil tanker as inflammable chemicals and not arsonic @ButVai
2338 2018-09-07 18:38:20 Don't forget the squirrel oil.
2339 2018-09-07 18:38:19 Wait, your bio says "My interests are land conservation & restoration of wildlife habitat." yet you are a vocal Trump supporter?

All that extra oil drilling and coal mining is going to do wonders for restoring wildlife habitat, eh?
2340 2018-09-07 18:38:15 Finally getting an oil change... it’s been a little while. But now they’re telling me I need a new air filter as well. I don’t like being an adult.
2341 2018-09-07 18:38:04 smoking weed is how they attack your great idea's to expand humanity into the stars as you provide clean safe ways to travel this planet seems to me big oil has us fighting the person to block idea/soulutions unlike Human-caused climate change fight the idea so no idea/solutions.
2342 2018-09-07 18:38:02 does he still have his purple suit? I heard the oil exec's loved it
2343 2018-09-07 18:37:23 The very reason he was invited.
2344 2018-09-07 18:37:12 Imagine this big players in oil & gas servicing sector being sanctioned in Equatorial Guinea . imagine if Nigeria.@BBoason httpv://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2018-09-07/equatorial-guinea-said-to-intend-to-cancel-oil-service-contracts#click=https://t.co/lFkV8yICtj

2347 2018-09-07 18:37:01 Dear Yogi ji- kindly initiate, lead and start a program for entire country by asking gov on India to declare and not to import oil for next 15 days and ask our PM to urge entire country  to use only public transport, car pooling,SHARE autos,taxis,bike,etc TO STRENGTHEN INR
2348 2018-09-07 18:36:57 are you still taking oil exec's on dinner dates in toronto? that was cute when you used to
2349 2018-09-07 18:36:54 These corporations manage to screw consumers both coming & going. They create a disaster, then sell a solution.  Trump creates a refugee crisis after private prisons are up & running.  Big oil gives us natural gas, allegedly not as dangerous as oil & still cashes in-again. Sick.
2350 2018-09-07 18:36:41 @anandrathi12

2351 2018-09-07 18:36:33 You are right....I think we who are aware of that think everyone knows. They don't...
2352 2018-09-07 18:36:31 People of Twitter, what’s the best cure for a stupidly itchy, angry looking insect bite? So for I’ve tried anthisan and tea tree oil. #itchy #insectbite
2353 2018-09-07 18:36:31 Pilots won't say anything, they put up with with breathing oil contaminated cabin air, just like the cabin crew and passengers do.
2354 2018-09-07 18:36:29 By same, do you mean you would fuck Olive Oil to death, or would Popeye fuck you to death?
2355 2018-09-07 18:36:27 By running out of oil
2356 2018-09-07 18:36:19 Dad made sure I knew how to change oil, spark plugs, air filter, and more. I still change 'em (well, cars don't have spark plugs now). When I dropped a belt on the used riding mower, to the web I went to print direx when the new belts arrived :-)
2357 2018-09-07 18:36:19 Dear Akshay - kindly initiate, lead and start a program for entire country by asking gov on India to declare and not to import oil for next 15 days and ask our PM to urge entire country  to use only public transport, car pooling,SHARE autos,taxis,bike,etc TO STRENGTHEN INR
2358 2018-09-07 18:36:02 Highest concentration of Oil in SA and it's gone to shit from Central planning. Singapore has almost no natural resources, yet it's one of the wealthiest places on the Asian continent.
2359 2018-09-07 18:35:43 Bring back whale oil!
2360 2018-09-07 18:35:41 Get someone to massage and rub the area you get it done with oil daily
2361 2018-09-07 18:35:38 Pls send it to me Yasir.
Let it serve as a reminder for me an my siblings
2362 2018-09-07 18:35:30 Dumb tweet again. Like I said, the oil sector doesn't contribute much to our GDP. And our economy is well into over $500b. If you do the maths, you'll see that we're the richest country in Africa and the 22nd richest in the world.
2363 2018-09-07 18:35:29 From behind a beaded curtain, you hear hissing. An oil lamp lies discarded nearby.
2364 2018-09-07 18:35:24 with oil. “ Those who hated her will now love her.”
Says Christ. She is my Esther.
2365 2018-09-07 18:35:19 the one in bottom of the thing that looks like it would hold oil. And the toilet in my daughter's bathroom won't stop running, can you stop by later?
2366 2018-09-07 18:35:16 I gotta get an oil change n go 2 Chuck E. Cheese lol ima b free 2nite gotta work a double 2mar
2367 2018-09-07 18:35:06 Lolzzzz funny who is feeding u with this lies, Abdulrasaq whose family house battered road was constructed by Saraki through his constituency project, this is a man who has oil money but with no impact in the lives of people
2368 2018-09-07 18:34:55 Bravo
2369 2018-09-07 18:34:50 Hahaha too honest! How about you find a way to add John Mayer, a pirate named One Eyed Pete, chicken feathers, super glue, handcuffs, a half eaten pizza, 5000 red skittles and 10 gallons of extra virgin olive oil to your story?
2370 2018-09-07 18:34:50 Because, you know, we would totally hoard food in buckets and invest in disreputable oil speculation companies anyway.  Using the name of Jesus to sell products makes it a ministry and we'll get jewels in our heavenly crowns if we invest.
2371 2018-09-07 18:34:46 Those are definitely not her words. They sound too Michelle Obama ish. Also, she defended n doubled down on POTUS, birthplace w/ her snake oil salesmen husband. History nor Americans will be kind to her. #PrisonerOfHerOwnMaking

2376 2018-09-07 18:34:11 When Crude Oil (Indian basket) became 46.41% cheaper, Petrol price went up by 7.95% and Diesel price went up by 38.68%.
This is Vikas under Modi Govt!
2377 2018-09-07 18:34:08 Not ever again.
2378 2018-09-07 18:34:00 Oh, today's hilarity - so when we were getting them, I bought what were labelled as "catnip sticks" for them to chew on.

I thought they were sticks with catnip oil on them or something. But those guys are too young to respond to the nip, so I put em away.

Well...
2379 2018-09-07 18:33:58 With all the money south African companies are taking out of Nigeria, we have a trade surplus....maybe it's oil exports? Something is wrong somewhere....maybe it's me
2380 2018-09-07 18:33:49 I LOVED this podcast. For @elonmusk, @joerogan and the rest of us in society who think there is a better way, hats off gentlemen. That 10% drop will be replaced by a long term exponentially higher gain when the oil addicts and peddlers and die off (or run out of gas).
2381 2018-09-07 18:33:46 Thanks will try flaxseed oil I’ve sourced some natural thyroid gland instead of Levo but GP has just told me my thyroid levels are normal, which hasn’t happened for years! Could be immune system attacking liver & pancreas too Got some dandelion & milk thistle etc to help liver

2383 2018-09-07 18:33:26 Has anyone tried @sky_beards beard oil? I’m intrigued by the names they’ve chosen for their various scents. The names are enticing and make me want to try them  Fruity pebble beard anyone? 
2384 2018-09-07 18:33:26 After listening to a few analysts comment on WCS differentials likely continuing to widen, it's only reassuring what I've already been thinking and doing, and that's to keep trimming heavy oil focused oil producers and focus on the light/medium. Sold out and took profit on $CVE.
2385 2018-09-07 18:33:06 Getting in your car after a fresh oil change? Sex.

2387 2018-09-07 18:33:03 When the media IS part of the story and the investigations,

THE MEDIA hides and deflects those facts!!!
#FakeNews
2388 2018-09-07 18:32:58 Digital art is just another art medium with its own ups & downs. Telling an artist that they’re lazy for doing digital art is the same thing as telling a painter they’re lazy for using oil paint. Stop coming up with shitty excuses for not wanting to pay artists a fair price.
2389 2018-09-07 18:32:47 Not even the same thing bro sorry we’re talking about people not supplements
2390 2018-09-07 18:32:41 It will take a breather for equities to rally into next year then for whole of 2019 it will wreck havoc . Also oil seems to be heading lower which is positive for eem
2391 2018-09-07 18:32:39 Do you ever feel like your car can dust a Ferrari after a oil change and tire rotation?

2394 2018-09-07 18:32:23 Britain and other world powers were in support of the federal all because of oil installations. There is a document on the London Policy of One Nigeria. 

It took several months for Britain do choose who to support. They considered supporting Biafra at a point.
2395 2018-09-07 18:32:20 Pop to Aldi for a pint of milk, leave with a kayak, chainsaw and bread maker for £8.75. 

Pop into Waitrose for a pint of milk, leave with truffle oil, Madagascan vanilla pods and organic goats milk, and no money till 2019.
2396 2018-09-07 18:32:20 Still here. Hour later. For. An. Oil. Change.
2397 2018-09-07 18:32:14 And just how much BT protein is in the oil?
2398 2018-09-07 18:32:12 secondly, oil has a ripple effect on the economy and the impact is much larger than the value/GDP. I am gonna stop there coz you are an "Economics Don," by the standards over there, you already know the rest
2399 2018-09-07 18:32:06 voters now it is about the money rich billionaires spend to trick people into thinking that they have your back to teach people that social security is bad even though we pay into it.  That starting wars for oil companies to go in and steal oil.  Some of us know the truth of your
2400 2018-09-07 18:32:03 Demand for Renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies is gaining ground which means less use of fossils. Investors are generally looking to put their money in energy sustainable projects and may soon become less interested in oil and gas if demand continues to drop
2401 2018-09-07 18:31:58 who the fuck knows it's one of his snake oil supplements
2402 2018-09-07 18:31:57 oil change isn't hard, it's one screw you have to remove.
2403 2018-09-07 18:31:54 #CutFuelTax NOBODY IS TELLING THIS
Why is petrol price high?

UPA paid oil manufacturers not with money but with "oil bonds." By 2014, UPA had swiped its credit card to borrow Rs 1.3 lakh crore of oil

Modi sarkar paid back Rs 1.3 lakh crore oil debt PLUS Rs 70,000 crore interest
2404 2018-09-07 18:31:53 I hate to be a “let me speak to the manager” ass bitch, but you’ve got me FUCKED UP if you think I’m paying $100 for an oil change

2409 2018-09-07 18:31:19 donations do not stop tearing down forests. Never have. Better to assess why forests being torn down? For palm oil plantations? Dont buy products with palm oil in them, Dove soap for example.
2410 2018-09-07 18:30:58 Don't believe the lies #Fargo he doesn't use names kn his stories you ever notice that? Maybe because he's making it up, that's what he does. @realDonaldTrump is nothing more than a modern day snake oil salesman.
2411 2018-09-07 18:30:57 What I don't hear mentioned is that many Canadians from across the country are also employed in the Oil Sands, particularly from the East Coast where good paying jobs are often in short supply.  The whole country is truly being adversely affected.
2412 2018-09-07 18:30:49 All this pressure coming from government to hire more women for oil and gas and mining jobs is getting out of hand. I've spent the last 9 years working in those industries, 8 of them in HR. You want to know why there are so few women in those professions now?

2420 2018-09-07 18:30:02 I taught my young son manners in hopes of keeping chivalry alive. This is what you do especially in the south. It is not sexist or racist but is quickly becoming extinct. Mostly being pushed aside by outsiders within America. Very sad.

2427 2018-09-07 18:29:18 This is not done. Half truth is always dangerous, put the international crude oil price also. Don't take people for a ride.
2428 2018-09-07 18:29:11 A leak in the Keystone pipeline is worse than first believed, spilling much more oil than first reported. Nearly 17,000 gal's of oil has leaked n S. Dakota since Saturday, pipeline owner TransCanada says up from the 187 gal's the company initially reported to federal authorities.
2429 2018-09-07 18:29:10 Too much oil in this spaghetti
2430 2018-09-07 18:29:07 Perfectly stated. Not everyone who works in Cleveland carries a friggin 1967 lunch pail and comes home with oil all over their dickies.
2431 2018-09-07 18:28:51 Dude you are a sham , FlimFlam Man , total snake oil sales man .. Each book exposes the tiny size of your character and how you had potential to be an agent for meaningful change and instead went the easy way  with @GOP D-bags #FakePresident #FakeMan #FakeLeader
2432 2018-09-07 18:28:48 What we need to do to hurt Russia is Oil price. If we work will America to flood the market with shale gas the oil price will crash. Their economy would be on its knees. @LBC

2434 2018-09-07 18:28:43 I shouldn't be this happy over having a humidifier in my room with an essential oil kit but I'm ecstatic
2435 2018-09-07 18:28:39 Yes they should be stepped up. But us and the rest of the EU need to find new suppliers of our oil and gas or he'll cut supplies in retaliation.
2436 2018-09-07 18:28:36 I went to get my oil changed and the guy told me my car smelled good lol

2442 2018-09-07 18:27:29 Aye I been thinkin about goin bald but I gotta know something. Do y’all mfs use extra baby oil to make y’all shit shine like that?
2443 2018-09-07 18:27:27 find a good leave in conditioner and/or oil after straightening your hair! it usually works for me and I have really bad frizzy hair
2444 2018-09-07 18:27:22 It is allready there! Naturli spreadable in Sainsburys,! And No palm oil!!
2445 2018-09-07 18:27:05 That place had a 3-legged chair that they were ‘managing’ and a standing fan that didn’t work. ACs barely functioned and the place smelled of soup with palm oil.
2446 2018-09-07 18:26:47 OMCs paying dividends to the govt not to Modi ji! Whether u pay the oil bonds thru tax payers’ money or consumers money, ultimately its people who have to pay! it’s better that user pays for what he consumes rather that all taxpayers being burdened with oil consumers expenditure

2450 2018-09-07 18:26:24 Similarities:
-harder you look, more you find
-full of impurities, needs to be refined to be useful
-slippery
-makes a mess if mishandled

Differences:
-oil can only be consumed once, data is infinitely reusable

Better metaphor: Data is the energy that drives analysis

2459 2018-09-07 18:25:23 Sir, I am a bit clueless here, why would oil min not tell abt 2lc cr oil bonds, this would have made a perfect justification for hike in oil prices vs low in intl market. Why now?
2460 2018-09-07 18:25:09 @INCIndia @cpimspeak @RahulGandhi Its time to go on streets regarding oil prices and general expenses, it is long overdue now. Why ain't you guys doing it? Publishing books won't do much. Wake up!
2461 2018-09-07 18:25:07 Man how good are oil diffusers? I throw on rainy mood playlist on Spotify to help sometimes too.
2462 2018-09-07 18:24:51 Snake oil salesman convention.
2463 2018-09-07 18:24:51 Tuffy’s auto zone, it’s across from Walmart. That’s where I go to get my oil changes, they are really nice
2464 2018-09-07 18:24:43 Random fact about me:  #PAXEast was my first gaming event ever, followed by #PAXWest. I was super young and wow did I know nothing about what I was getting into. I do remember @8bitweapon and computer tower filled with mineral oil. Hmm...
2465 2018-09-07 18:24:42 You and facts are just oil and water 
But you still blame Trump  #MAGA #2020Trump
2466 2018-09-07 18:24:36 Need to oil my joints again. I swear, sometimes I feel like the tin man from the wizard of oz =A=
2467 2018-09-07 18:24:35 A snake oil salesman who almost destroyed this country.  Thank God for Trump!
2468 2018-09-07 18:24:34 PRESIDENT TRUMP AND EUROPEAN UNION TRY TO CONVINCE THE WORLD VENEZUELA NEEDS HUMANITARIAN AID HOWEVER DO NOT ALLOW CREDITS INSTITUTIONS ALLOW US TO TRANSACTIONS AND BUY OUR OÍL BONDS FOR FOOD AND RAW MATERIAL IMPORTS
2469 2018-09-07 18:24:32 Yeah first a toner then an oil then a moisturiser then another one for good measure also an under eye gel and a lip balm preceded by a cleaning routine
2470 2018-09-07 18:24:29 Nope, that would against their religion. She is trying to lure Afgany women so they can do the same then steal their husbands oil. Just saying...
2471 2018-09-07 18:23:50 Yes, a "small" urban car, 6 and 8 cylinders in the late 70th... oil shock!
Bad luck for AMC.
2472 2018-09-07 18:23:49 Everybody is talking about increase in fuel prices but Modi govt paid Rs. 2 Lac crore pending due of oil bonds created by UPA govt.Indians r least interested in th health of economy so Modiji should give subsidy on oil & create another Rs.2 Lac Cr burden just to win voter's trust
2473 2018-09-07 18:23:43 Fk the oil on my face is enough to use for cooking
2474 2018-09-07 18:23:34 You can't refine enough oil to power Toronto.. so you send it to Texas... it's not about us wanting your oil, it's about you needing it refined..
2475 2018-09-07 18:23:28 I find that white noise helps me. If it’s too quiet I can’t sleep so I use an oil diffuser at night. Definitely helps.
2476 2018-09-07 18:22:59 @PepsiCo @Nestle @Pizza Hut & @TacoBell spend millions on their ‘ethical’ image & say they only use RSPO-certified #palmoil. But truth is @RSPOtweets gives the OK to destructive palm oil by brand @Indofood #savetheorangutans
2477 2018-09-07 18:22:49 the oil money that funds and fuels war in the Middle east, mangled that word.
2478 2018-09-07 18:22:46 Which oil do you recommend?
2479 2018-09-07 18:22:44 The manner in which the Common man has been taken for a ride is very evident with the Move On Petrol Prices. It keeps moving on & on. Hope our economy doesn't become like Bolivar economy . It's easy to Fill a Tank in Venezuela but difficult to fill your tummy. Oil Topples Govt !
2480 2018-09-07 18:22:32 When I get the cars oil change I connect my music to the Bluetooth of the car lol. It always scares the guys doing maintenance on it. I’m very evil
2481 2018-09-07 18:22:31 1 barrel Brent crude is 180 litres !
Present rate 76$ , Usd/inr rate 72 
Multiply both 76×72 =5472 
Now divide 5472 /180 =30.40 
It's rate of per litre crude oil 
Total refinery cost 22rs 
One litre petrol is ready at 52rs 
Dealer margin transport add 4rs 
56rs. 30rs net profit?
2482 2018-09-07 18:22:27 Why not oil wrestling?
2483 2018-09-07 18:22:26 Just cooking up coconut oil this afternoon. Gonna name this batch the B.O. game changer.
2484 2018-09-07 18:22:16 I did do roasted veggies, some weird squash with salt, pepper and olive oil, and beetroot with balsamic vinegar, very tasty 
2485 2018-09-07 18:22:14 yesss with the oil & hot sauce
2486 2018-09-07 18:22:01 I get on the Reagan topic every so often, he rolled back the efforts of Jimmy Carter to get off of Foreign oil, the oil money that funds and ules war in the Middle East, the amount of Damage Reagan did for profit, IMO played a big part in bringing down the WTC.
2487 2018-09-07 18:21:58 ok bet cause that shit is so good
2488 2018-09-07 18:21:55 I remember it well.  He said he wanted to lessen our dependency on foreign oil, which might curb us going to war for oil as we did under Bush.  He was right! he's not against oil refining - he's against fracking and endangering the lives of many Americans!
2489 2018-09-07 18:21:53 @ntvkenya @MarkMasai Kenyans hates it when the Price of oil goes up. The Government should sympathise with us because the crisis puts a hurt on our pockets. It's difficult
2490 2018-09-07 18:21:52 All Religion is a Form of Madness! Makes me mad! Hip-hop is a mind control technique invented to get people’s hands in the air! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
2491 2018-09-07 18:21:31 They forgot to oil the machine that day
2492 2018-09-07 18:21:29 Yah now am in line with your thoughts 
All what China is looking for is a continent rich in oil to colonise 

Yah they just want to have something to control
2493 2018-09-07 18:21:29 It's OK. Let Saudi Arabia produce the oil. Mexico and the US produce the cars. And Canada produce the milk. What could go wrong? 
2494 2018-09-07 18:21:29 My oil light has been on since yesterday afternoon, once it came on i called my dad, he checked it this morning and its stillll on! smh i just had it in the shop last month.
2495 2018-09-07 18:21:27 But BOST too, what did you do with Springfield oil in 2014.
Oil nu wohe
2496 2018-09-07 18:21:26 Getting an oil change, an oil change, an oil change...

2497 2018-09-07 18:21:21 everytime i hear someone say they put coconut oil on their skin....i cringe. coconut oil is comedogenic!!!! it clogs your pores!!!
2498 2018-09-07 18:20:59 いいよ～いいよ～その調子～
2499 2018-09-07 18:20:57 I think that’s exactly what he meant. Or more precisely: “here’s the new dog whistle; repeat after me.”
2500 2018-09-07 18:20:56 I forgot to mention the oil aswell. I’m ok I don’t like change.
2501 2018-09-07 18:20:56 What's interesting is that we haven't seen people float conspiracy theories that Elon Musk is being taken down by the big oil companies

...because that's almost a believable explanation
2502 2018-09-07 18:20:54 The Bible was written before coal, gas, oil etc. powered the wealth making industries. Religion promoted male muscle for energy. Why do intelligent people adhere to an archaic, inane scam to justify forcing everyone to be "pro-life?"
2503 2018-09-07 18:20:44 Texas, of course! Big oil, big guns, big mouth! Go for it against Booker, talk about grandstanding. The GOP is pushing this nomination through, you know it. The President is unfit, you know it. Keep to your agenda, don't waiver. See the outcome.
2504 2018-09-07 18:20:40 Do you use a Essential oil diffuser?  Just wondering because when I diffuse certain oils I dream crazy like that 
2505 2018-09-07 18:20:39 Like oil oil? Or olive oil? Being that I’m asking I’m eager to see this video
2506 2018-09-07 18:20:36 Even the oil scent didn't work 
2507 2018-09-07 18:20:13 Any recommendations for someone who can come and fix an oil boiler in Highclere?
2508 2018-09-07 18:20:10 Great start having to correct my professor - it's not "tar sands" but "oil sands." Okay, if we don't agree - let's call it what it is - bitumen sands. #AlbertanPride
2509 2018-09-07 18:20:09 Science: pimple grows when excess oil gets trapped in your pores

Muslim parents: it’s because you sleep all day and don’t pray ya haywaan
2510 2018-09-07 18:20:08 The Americans secured the oil and the others are 'enjoying' the rest of the Syrian melee ...This is rather annoying..aaand frustrating?
2511 2018-09-07 18:20:08 A few drops of oil wouldn’t hurt.
2512 2018-09-07 18:20:03 Why? You think America’s issues don’t matter to Canada? You want@our oil and resources. You want our supper at NATO. you want access to our markets. 

I have every  right to speak to you about this. We share a continent and a world.
2513 2018-09-07 18:20:01 @PremierScottMoe @LeelaMLA @Uplands_ranch oil is safer to move in pipeline than train
2514 2018-09-07 18:19:47 Yes, but kinda only to the extent that snake oil was good for the economy.
2515 2018-09-07 18:19:18 Pompy buddy..thanks for coming dude.. by the way. U told us not to buy Iranian oil..r u gonna give a better pricing and pricing terms.. or will do one thing, better u come and rule here directly, teaching us where to buy what..we know buddy.. what to do here and how to do?

2520 2018-09-07 18:18:48 This is more like nice cream. It’s definitely much healthier than regular ice cream. Okay so what you will need:
5 frozen bananas (frozen makes it more thick and not as liquidy)
1/2 cup soaked cashews(optional)
vegan chocolate chips
2 tbsp coconut oil
2521 2018-09-07 18:18:41 And besides oil is not every thing, we have numerous natural resources to tap from, like in abundance..bro this is Nigeria, our land is so blessed..we'll sort our selves, in tge mean time enjoy your country that is being ruled by a political dynasty. Father to son
2522 2018-09-07 18:18:36 you know they cooked those eggs in vegetable oil...
2523 2018-09-07 18:18:35 Some people need to cook and eat food in AUkAAT cooking oil.q k har chez AUkAAT main achi lagti hai ..
2524 2018-09-07 18:18:25 Maybe some of the natural sources are more worrying. Maybe Palm oil products.

Unless the 4% are plastic microbeads.
2525 2018-09-07 18:18:15 Any recommendation for a hair oil or leave-in conditioner for my dry ends?

2528 2018-09-07 18:17:59 You should try burning peppermint oil, or just having a strong peppermint smell bc rats hate that shit, it wont get rid of them.but maybe they'll avoid your room ;;
2529 2018-09-07 18:17:59 Can't help unless we strike oil in India. We don't have those kind of forex reserves to make fuel cheaper.

2535 2018-09-07 18:17:20 Ca c'est sur. Mais pour faire dans le point Godwin, il est plus facile de monter dans le train que de participer a la revolte du gettho de Varsovie.
2536 2018-09-07 18:17:13 You're praying for oil to dry up, is that because your country dosent have a drop of it? Goan check the amount of oil reserves we have in Nigeria, gas reserves too so if you're thinking about drying up, think again.

2540 2018-09-07 18:16:44 Let this be a call to action, if this doesn’t motivate you to go red I don’t know what will SNAKE OIL anyone?
2541 2018-09-07 18:16:40 It was written by one of Trump’s own people! That Deep State line may fly with the dwindling minority MAGA crowd but the rest of the country isn’t buying the snake oil you are selling. We’re onto you. (Well, most of us never bought into the lies in the 1st place.)

2544 2018-09-07 18:16:09 Rick Wiles is afraid of educated folk. They tend to understand he is selling snake oil.
2545 2018-09-07 18:16:08 Can't beat the new string feel. Been putting mine off for ages need some lemon oil to clean the fretboard with first!
2546 2018-09-07 18:16:03 At jiffy lube getting an oil change.
2547 2018-09-07 18:16:00 I remember when I streamed late. I forced myself to stop streaming at certain times to adjust. I forced myself to wake up early because when it’s time to sleep I’d be super tired. Im still adjusting. I love night streams but I find daytime I have more energy.  Lavender oil helps!

2553 2018-09-07 18:15:26 Yes, I do have #AppsurdCats who are rescues. Sphynx cats love human companionship. Their breed is described as monkey, dog & child. Think about that. They need a bath every week because no fur to absorb oil. They need human, blanket, heating pad windowsill Cat TV is a bonus.
2554 2018-09-07 18:15:24 Ok fellow Deplorables the monster came out today to try to sell us some snake oil. After his 8 yrs.of disaster he comes out with his lies to try to get his socialist democrats in office. Remember they want free everything. We all know that’s not possible. Someone has to pay. 1/

2558 2018-09-07 18:15:11 I got an oil change and a free car wash, I love carmax 
2559 2018-09-07 18:15:10 I just love when an oil change turns into a $500 day. Cars are stupid.
2560 2018-09-07 18:15:09 I hate it when cooking recipes are listed completely in imperial units without metrics: 1/16 pints vinegar 1 ounce salt, 1/2 pound of potatoes , 1/3 gill of oil, 1/4 of a gallon of water, 1/32nd stones of minced beef , 3 inches of a cucumber and a footlong bagel
2561 2018-09-07 18:15:07 Hanging out for an hour waiting to get my oil changed so someone talk to me I’m bored
2562 2018-09-07 18:14:49 I sprayed cooking oil all over my dms. Point being, please slide into them anyone.

2567 2018-09-07 18:14:17 Correction. The figure was close to $434 million and not $400 million. URA slapped Heritage Oil with a 30% ($120 million) charge before the case went to the Tax Appeals Tribunal, and later hit Tullow Oil with an agency notice to pay $313 million.

2570 2018-09-07 18:13:58 @pepboysauto , made a reservation for 1, got here ten mins early. Car was pulled back at 1:50. Why do you book appointments? Coming up on an hour and a half for an oil change...

2572 2018-09-07 18:13:50 Should have just went to Nissan. Appointment at 1:30. Still here almost 45 minutes later. Just wanted an oil change. 
2573 2018-09-07 18:13:50 I don’t generally use such things. Maybe I should—exfoliants, definitely. But there is this little known effect most people aren’t aware of: the more you strip your face of oil, the more your oil glands panic and make even more oil.

2577 2018-09-07 18:13:27 Hard to say that when oil and farmer welfare queens are getting billions from the feds, I'd say. But keep up your fake news, snowflake.
2578 2018-09-07 18:13:25 I was told the Proposed Affordable clean energy rule is replacing Obama's Clean power plan. Apparently it's just the beginning of the EPA relaxing it's regulations on the power industries including oil and gas and even coal. Companies are already anticipating that it will happen.

2592 2018-09-07 18:12:36 It’s also just money from war. The wars themselves make people rich. It’s not even about the oil and stuff.
2593 2018-09-07 18:12:31 At that time India had to buy oil at $100+ and the government was providing subsidies and not increasing taxes substantially — resulting in increased current account deficit therefore ₹ depreciated.

2597 2018-09-07 18:12:05 An oil export terminal makes no sense on multiple levels. Why exporting oil when striving for energy independence? Why produce this oil so that it can be burned and thereby help inundated coastal Louisiana?
2598 2018-09-07 18:12:04 Springfield stored products in BOST's facilities. When they came later, they said that a part of the oil had been lost.

2599 2018-09-07 18:11:45 Like a complete ban on drilling oil? Do you think?
2600 2018-09-07 18:11:40 This is very bad way of putting facts. Check crude oil prices and global economic situation during UPA2, imagine what inflation wud be if today crude was 120 dollars

2602 2018-09-07 18:11:35 It appears that MoP has lost the authority to initiate the proposal to bring oil products under GST, since so many times this statement has been repeated in the past few months.Let 2019 be the auspicious time.Just 3 months away.

2698 2018-09-07 18:00:01 Feliz cumpleaños, everyone whose folks were spurting the offspring oil into the pork cask on National Peaches ‘N’ Cream Day!
2699 2018-09-07 17:59:57 GeneYus is our team's Oil of the Month for September!!
2700 2018-09-07 17:59:55 periodI’m bouta wear my curls, use castor oil for my edges and then get the twist soon but my edges need a break
2701 2018-09-07 17:59:46 Never heard of cotton seed oil? Read labels, it’s often in there.
2702 2018-09-07 17:59:45 This from a snake oil salesman who promised change and gave us ... status quo.
2703 2018-09-07 17:59:45 remind me again how Exxon held off research saying oil is bad for the country and how y’all contributed to climate changeV
2704 2018-09-07 17:59:42 Sana oil may pang inom :((
2705 2018-09-07 17:59:35 Like a new name will change this BS company, their snake oil products or their long term affiliation with a soon to be convicted felon. Excellent reporting Mr. Z!!

2708 2018-09-07 17:59:19 After listening to the @APCNigeria excuse about 19% oil revenue in as many years, the parable of the talents comes to mind. Right now, it is in a hurry to prove that it is doing more with less whereas, we can see otherwise. It is borrowing so much much and doing too little.
2709 2018-09-07 17:59:19  it’s okay, I don’t mind repeating. Get some lemon essential oil and put it on a cotton ball, then just kind of dab it on the sticker to get it covered in a thin layer. Let it sit a minute or so and the sticker and any goop should come off!
2710 2018-09-07 17:59:11 The oil ran out... now it is squeaking..
2711 2018-09-07 17:59:07 Dear Oil and Gas Executives: 1990s saw CO2 emissions at 380ppm in the atmosphere, 2018 we are now at 412ppm. When we reach 430ppm the earth will be inhabitable & our air unbreathable; increases in wildfires and landslides, at what point do you say"ok, lets stop selling gasoline"?
2712 2018-09-07 17:59:05 The NEP forced Canadians to buy Alberta Oil but the liars persist to justify the whining.
2713 2018-09-07 17:58:54 they said there's something going on in the airport road. I planned to go to Oil Clinic but my service said it's not safe. Update

2715 2018-09-07 17:58:29 @CityAttyPeteH ICE is the crisis. Oil companies are the crisis.  Protesters are not the crisis. Drop the prosecution of activists!  #Not1More #HistoryIsWatching #ChingaLaMigra
2716 2018-09-07 17:58:23 Right now people are very poor and dont have any jobs all of our oil is being stolen by Iran
2717 2018-09-07 17:58:22 Haha so the conservative government tried to stream line the regulatory and approval process and the the pipeline STILL didn’t get approved. I worked in oil and gas regulation and it easily the most regulated in the world. Frankly it is excessively regulated; Y KM bailed on it.
2718 2018-09-07 17:58:18 The problem with most of us we don’t know how many products are made from oil and gas that we use daily (even the nay sayers use them) I have never witnessed so much chopping off of our on feet. It’s like we are intent on ruining every advance we have made in the last 100 years.

2731 2018-09-07 17:57:23 I've got couple ideas on how to make the process involving Mg powder safer:
Use regular propane/butane torch cartridge to drive air out of the apparatus and lower the bubbler below reaction flask.
Slowly add Mg powder-oil suspension through addition funnel to preheated oil+MeOH.

2733 2018-09-07 17:57:14 What will India do with that port now. Under US pressure India cannot import oil so what will be the trade. Petrol prices will further go up with lower imports from Iran
2734 2018-09-07 17:57:11 Why on earth would somebody want to remove carotene from palm oil? That scarce functional nutrient is what you people want to use activated charcoal to get rid off?

Why now?
2735 2018-09-07 17:57:11 After the oil they’ve been soaked in dries up
2736 2018-09-07 17:57:09 Love walking in the dark on a clear night...especially on hols! Then curling up in a cool bed with skin feeling super fresh #MidnightMagicOil l love the night oil btw, its done my combo skin at 38 wonders 
2737 2018-09-07 17:57:08 #CutFuelTax why public can't understand the taxation and subsidy system with oil price. Who said public can't understand actually they never  want people to understand such things. People know everything and we still support and trust the center government.
2738 2018-09-07 17:57:04 Noted
I agree with you that Kenya is not close to Nigeria in fields of poverty, low HDI, low life expectancy, lawlessness, corruption, mismanagement, etc. 
It's only the GDP, Population, and Music that they beat us. As for the GDP, the Oil will dry up soon then we shall see.
2739 2018-09-07 17:57:04 Thi oil prices hike is a "Vardan"for ur beloved leader. But remember one thing,if someone is honest, sincere, &devoted to ones duties,God will always be there with him all the time. No apparent odd would touch him till he is with the blessings of Lord Shiva.
2740 2018-09-07 17:57:02 yeah its pretty cool i got my car to stop overheating but uh now it has an oil leak so um yeah

2744 2018-09-07 17:56:39 @elonmusk is a unique human being who does his best and is being tarnished by the oil industrial complex.

2753 2018-09-07 17:55:51 Finish this intolerable weakness, complete this compromise; end this kindness with the dirty government of India; if you do not stop the Iranian oil in November, you will not miss the Republican elections. The President is alert me seriously

2761 2018-09-07 17:55:01 hi nak tanya. if i remove all the products on my face using the garnier micellar water(yg warna kuning ada oil tu) then wash my face with my regular cleanser... does it count as a double cleansing?

2763 2018-09-07 17:54:31 @UmaruSanda @Citi973 I support wholly d submission of Hon Edward Bawa that only a forensic audit on d pricing of Ghana's crude oil can truly settle this matter. $34m is money enough to provide countless classrooms for a struggling free SHS. #CitiNewsroom
2764 2018-09-07 17:54:17 That chain probably needs a bit of oil
2765 2018-09-07 17:54:14 Ahhh sorry babe, don't give up keep on looking for tissue oil
2766 2018-09-07 17:54:13 he made it possible for the people to realize what a charlatan he was and still is. Snake oil salesman with humongous ego.
2767 2018-09-07 17:54:02 The California Olive Board might tell you it's no problem to substitute olive oil for vegetable oil in a baking recipe -- DON'T BELIEVE IT. These blueberry muffins are just off...
2768 2018-09-07 17:53:55 True. Imagine taking the trillions we are still pumping into wars that are at least partly caused by or related to oil and using even a small part of it to research safe/cheap nuclear, fusion, solar, wind, seasonal storage and batteries.
2769 2018-09-07 17:53:55 Throw out baby oil if you have it. It's made from refined petroleum which is terrible for you and the environment. Olive oil is an alternative.

2776 2018-09-07 17:53:12 Rub clary sage oil on your belly, drink raspberry leaf tea, SHIT TON of walking, sex, squats. Those were all things people told me to try when I was pregnant, ended up being induced anyway, but the clary sage oil and raspberry tea would give me cramps if I had them together
2777 2018-09-07 17:53:09 @Solidteknics i have to ask when seasoning on stove top: when you're moving the rag around and the oil is burning for 20 seconds (per your instructions) should you immediately remove pan from heat for 1 moment...or still let it smoke for a while before moving it off the heat ?
2778 2018-09-07 17:53:04 What you DON'T mention are the millions of INFORMED Missourians who aren't buying your snake oil and recognize you're trying to take away their healthcare, social security and Medicare benefits and rights.

2780 2018-09-07 17:53:02 The bills are paid, paid my aunts the money that I owe them. Truck got oil change n now to buy little food for the casa then boom!... F.U.N.
2781 2018-09-07 17:53:02 Yup & @RachelNotley controls the world price of oil. Need a grown-up convo. Adult won't work because adult is just an age. Grown-up is lived experience, earned knowledge, awareness of one's lack in both of these, willingness to learn & respect for life's challenges. No whining.
2782 2018-09-07 17:52:58  it's also not an abandoned oil platform, but an abandoned wartime observation tower, and off Suffolk not Norfolk, but now I'm just being pedantic. We adopted it as our country for International Week

Reminds me of the other night. I was making creamy tomato pasta bake (lactose free of course) and I burnt my arm from the cooking oil, so dinner was later than expected. My sister was miffed with this and wouldn't stop moaning.
2789 2018-09-07 17:52:15 People trade bloody gold, & oil, but trip b/c a guy smoked* took ONE draw of a blunt? Thats corny, & it's not like he cares people BUY those dips.
2790 2018-09-07 17:52:11 He didn’t “gut” the laws. I worked in oil and gas regulation and it’s is objectively the most regulated in all of the world, even with Harper. It’s excessively regulated now, it’ll be unnecessarily regulated after the new bill.

2807 2018-09-07 17:50:50 I heard you on the podcast today. I had learned so much from you in that podcast. From solar city to the Tesla Roadster, To why we are using oil and fossil fuel’s and the detrimental effects on our environment and being nice to people around us. @elonmusk, You are the future.

2813 2018-09-07 17:50:24 .@timesofindia No one owes you a market. Much less a toxic, $3 trillion+/year revenue stream that is killing the planet.

So, oil with an effective cap of $25/barrel or lower vs solar & natural gas that are practically free.

2815 2018-09-07 17:50:20 A barrel of crude oil is retailing at below $68 how the heck does a gallon cost almost $5 in Kenya  and same gallon costs  an average of$ 2.54 in USA .1 us liquid gallon = 3.785 liters @kot let’s do the math

2817 2018-09-07 17:50:12 Lotions tend to have high water, low oil content. Can worsen disease through evaporation. Creams (low water) are better, but greasy. #pafpcme
2818 2018-09-07 17:49:57 Oil change shops are always suspect.  Once after getting my oil changed and driving down the highway the screw plug came out at 75 mph.  Had to get it towed.  They didn't tighten it.
2819 2018-09-07 17:49:57 I pulled up for an oil change. I don’t care about nothing else. Just my lil oil change.
2820 2018-09-07 17:49:56 This just in: I'm waiting to get my oil changed at Honda and the music went from country to ratchet r&b lol perfect. Thanks for accommodating us all  #honda #firsttexashonda #atx #accomodatingallgenres #oilchange
2821 2018-09-07 17:49:54 @PMOIndiaModi public is already burdened with taxes at least free public from light bill with solar plants and give promotion to electric cars and bikes
And get free from crude oil buying !!
2822 2018-09-07 17:49:53 The Android store is far worse. Security apps are nothing but adware or snake oil.
2823 2018-09-07 17:49:52 This can happen only when a Pandit or a hindu becomes a prime minister.

2830 2018-09-07 17:49:15 僕を酸化させたらダメだよ。オイルにとって酸化は命取り。…僕を見守っててね⁇
2831 2018-09-07 17:49:08 Yet another list of wet dream material made up by wet dreamers so they can enjoy more wet dreams. Hidden oil fields, Unicorn Herds and Magic Beans should be added to your fantasy list.
2832 2018-09-07 17:49:02 Getting an oil change with mom: “why did i grab my liscence and not my debit card? I cant pay with that”
2833 2018-09-07 17:49:02 Though there is hike in the oil prices in India, no downfall in its demand. Reason to worry. We need to accept that America and Gulf is going to rule the roost for oil prices.  More strategic planning needed to solve this problem for good and all.

Next he'll open up Gettysburg for oil exploration..
He's not fit for office
2839 2018-09-07 17:48:45 @UmaruSanda but why didn't ministry of finance contact GNPC to get the accurate information about the crude oil prices before throwing  their document to public spaces? I guess something is wrong somewhere. #citinewsroom

2842 2018-09-07 17:48:38 A new magazine on French food is on the way. It's called Taste of France. I wonder who their olive oil expert will be ..
2843 2018-09-07 17:48:34 @PiyushGoyal sir why not explore options of granting commercial charging point to normal people and households... would generate huge employment ,  lessen the ques at petrol pumps and income would be fairly distributed among common people instead of OIL PSUs
2844 2018-09-07 17:48:31 A130 Northbound – One lane closed between A132 (Rettendon) and A12 J17 (Howe Green) due to an oil spillage.
2845 2018-09-07 17:48:19 China, India, Turkey, Russia, and the three European countries are the only countries that protest sanctions. I really do not know why the banks and companies in these countries are not being sanctioned, why the oil refineries in China and India are not punished.

2847 2018-09-07 17:47:58 Did you try Rick Simpson Oil???
2848 2018-09-07 17:47:54 I partially agree with you but my point is that our entire system is based on government intervention from decades back. Is it fair we keep farmers afloat? Oil? But then not banks who hold Americans money and mortgages?
2849 2018-09-07 17:47:53 They will even argue that the oil is our collective resources yet their own resources is solely for them
2850 2018-09-07 17:47:50 reeks of patchouli oil.

2856 2018-09-07 17:46:56 I've been reglazing windows for two days at work and I smell like linseed oil I feel so fulfilled and respectable
2857 2018-09-07 17:46:31 My hair oil like I damped it off but it was still there so I got the stain remover and wiped it and like let the product soak in my shell then I dried it
2858 2018-09-07 17:46:29 I wish someone had told me that before I watched it From one Natalie to another, Do Not watch it!
2859 2018-09-07 17:46:29 My boyfriend lives out of town but he’s been here the last couple weekends.  

Today, he insisted on dropping me off at work so he could get my oil changed and see about my tires. He also asked what I needed for groceries. Gosh I appreciate this dude so much

2862 2018-09-07 17:46:09 Not gonna happen!!Think about it!!Oil Autos and the rich and powerful few that control the globe. It is not in their best interest. I am sure many have been killed to keep this secret!

BTW where is that 12000 MWs? His govt just borrowd oil n lng to give IPPs to produce electricity
FYI he hs left 1200 Billion circular debt. how n why?
2864 2018-09-07 17:45:57 our produce and meat and eggs etc are so terrible compared to what they can taste like in other parts of the world, a lil olive oil isn't going to suddenly make them delicious
2865 2018-09-07 17:45:55 Hahaha wedidaw ka sedu
2866 2018-09-07 17:45:52 Crazily enough, the answer I found online claimed there were 16000 caribou (way more than that) and only 9000 people.
So... Anchorage is the largest city. I think about 250,000 pop.? Maybe less with oil layoffs. The state itself is probably close to a half million people.
2867 2018-09-07 17:45:50 #CrudeOil Drillers cut two oil rigs in the week to Sept. 7, bringing the total count down to 860, General Electric Co's Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. #OOTT #OPEC #Commodities #EnergyMarket $USO $UCO #brent #WTI $XLE $CL_F

2869 2018-09-07 17:45:42 The most recent World Bank study does not support that statement about the worlds poor.  In fact, most of them are farmers and when we stop dumping food aid it puts them back in business.  We are all for fuel cell technology and American oil production, not for importing oil.
2870 2018-09-07 17:45:39 I had a dream that I got some stretch marks on the side of my butt and my first thought was "oh no where's my coconut oil" lmaoo I hate myself

2874 2018-09-07 17:45:34 I’m surprised your take isn’t something along the lines of using a wool brush, motor oil, and dish soap as the “only real way” to brush your teeth

2876 2018-09-07 17:45:09 Sis. Drizzle oil and bake it at 175° for 45 mins to 1 hour. If you rly rly love yourself. Season it then.
2877 2018-09-07 17:45:06 Ingredient Watch: Eating mayonnaise this September? It's made by adding oil to egg yolks. Commercial mayo can be as much as 80% fat!

2888 2018-09-07 17:44:15 Yesteday I blew up my apparatus despite using oil bath and heating very slowly. Although few days earlier similar reaction (but with vigorous stirring, foil on condenser instead of bubbler and direct heating on a lab plate) didn't get out of control.
2889 2018-09-07 17:44:05 The @michamber is either a) being lazy here and parroting talking points or b) intentionally misleading its citizens about the likelihood and dangers of pipelines and oil spills. The term "most heavily regulated" is kind of a dead-giveaway for the former.
2890 2018-09-07 17:43:58 미치겠네
2891 2018-09-07 17:43:54 The thing is, I’d rather a coarse talking guy from Queens who respects the constitution than a smooth talking snake oil salesman who sh$ts on it.
2892 2018-09-07 17:43:48 Hes the biggest snake oil salesman ever!!!!

2904 2018-09-07 17:42:58 Hey Obama! You didn't build this!   And this is only Friday!

More Americans now employed than ever recorded in our history
Manufacturing jobs growing at the fastest rate in more than 3 decades
Coal exports up 60 percent and U.S. oil production hitting an all-time high

2911 2018-09-07 17:41:47 @UmaruSanda:Umaru, the fact that MoF and GNPC are unable to reconcile their expectations and pricing of our oil is worrying. Now, let's hear from the Minister if he is satisfied with the response from GNPC on the benchmark pricing #CitiNews#
2912 2018-09-07 17:41:45 Sir are we going from oil based economy to Lithium based economy in coming times. We don't have lithium reserves and need to be dependent on imports. Is bio fuel not better idea which can be extracted from abundant agriculture waste ?
2913 2018-09-07 17:41:44 Today is #fuckmefriday. First internet goes down and Comcast is useless getting it back. Now the oil change shop just screwed me. I need to shut it down for the day.
2914 2018-09-07 17:41:23 my boyfriend teaching me how to do an oil change  thank his he gave my car one tho cause baaaby I wasn’t paying 80 for this shit 
2915 2018-09-07 17:41:22 “ We like oil and water , we just don’t mix “
2916 2018-09-07 17:41:20 Who's going to effect the order. Oil retailers are awaiting ERC @PavelOimeke to review the prices. Total confusion. This evening I paid 18$ more to fill up my tank with unleaded super.
2917 2018-09-07 17:41:11 The grave mistake of not the Oil producing States in 1968, supporting the ravenous buccaneers against their own blood. What can we do now
2918 2018-09-07 17:41:05 Well , it is.
Because our cars and buses run on the green dress worn by Jhanvi and not on oil.
2919 2018-09-07 17:41:04 Soo I went out with an oil stain on my forehead. Yup confidence level 110%
2920 2018-09-07 17:40:48 I thought the whole point of an appointment was that I wouldn’t have to wait an hour for an oil change. It takes 30 min tops.
2921 2018-09-07 17:40:46 If we restructure to regions. We will develop regional capitals. Have regional ministers. For instance, regional ministry of environment in South East deals with erosions, south South - oil spills, North West and East - desertification, South West - flooding, NC - deforestation.
2922 2018-09-07 17:40:38 I went to a "Climate Change" protest yesterday full of "environmentalists" clamoring for government to crack down on corporations, on oil companies, on rich people ... but when you suggest something THEY can easily do against climate change, suddenly nobody is interested.

2925 2018-09-07 17:40:30 don’t use peroxide!! salt water & tea tree oil will help but sometimes if you just let it heal on it’s own it will go away! also a derm can razor it off!
2926 2018-09-07 17:40:27 Food for thought:
Wouldn't it be funny if Popeye's Chicken was fried in olive oil
2927 2018-09-07 17:40:25 Ah yes, the snake oil salesman speaks.
2928 2018-09-07 17:40:24 Had your side won, there would be demand for vote on whether or not we liked the details of how that plan would work in practice, along with which public spending should be cut to account for loss of fiscal transfer & oil money misinformation from Yes campaign.

2935 2018-09-07 17:39:52 Nah, just use the electricity that was being used to refine oil into gasoline and use that to power the batteries.
2936 2018-09-07 17:39:41 I think he works for the oil companies
2937 2018-09-07 17:39:29 Tried applying castor oil. I feel my lashes thick already. Or is it just the oil?
2938 2018-09-07 17:39:28 No oil for the tiki torch maybe?
2939 2018-09-07 17:39:24 Obama drilled, fracked and pipelined 6x more than Bush. You supported these same initiatives ... stop pretending you care about environment. Money is always before planet to politicians who take oil and gas money.
2940 2018-09-07 17:39:23 To keep the value of rupee floating otherwise it will go to 95. And also in India export income is not taxed. So it's profitable for oil companies to export. Also it reduces our trade deficit.

2946 2018-09-07 17:38:43 My advise would be, get on board or be left in the dust of the oil sands or in a faint memory of the yesteryears! Like Obama said, "it's always the right time to do what's right!" The choice is yours!

2957 2018-09-07 17:37:43 @ProfGaines #BIL150-2018 Omega 3 fatty acids are a specific type of polyunsaturated fat. It is found in fish oil and has been known to reduce risks of coronary heart disease.
2958 2018-09-07 17:37:17 Andy it going back to his favourite word " failure" you must have heard that word a lot growing up Andy!

2962 2018-09-07 17:36:52 Macadamia by far the best nut - also as butter & oil.
2963 2018-09-07 17:36:49 More like rancid cooking oil.
2964 2018-09-07 17:36:46 Time for an oil change
2965 2018-09-07 17:36:35 I know, and US staying up late at nights to watch China too
2966 2018-09-07 17:36:28 it works by block and replace  - it shuts down the body's thyroid system and replaces it with synthetic hormone - levo - it  will take time to get thyroid back working again, flaxseed oil is best for overactive immune system 
also check out taurine , infrared light / saunas
2967 2018-09-07 17:36:14 I now understand why tsa women be so pissed . This chick just spilled all her oil from her vap pin and when she went to pick it up her coffee spilled on her thigh . THIS IS WHY!

2969 2018-09-07 17:36:11 @elonmusk Now, the Saudis, and the U.A.E. have been desperate to come up with an industry to replace their own oil industry. The problem is, nobody wants to live there. One way for them to develop an escape plan from oil, is Tesla.
2970 2018-09-07 17:36:11 Keep rationalizing why civilians r getting killed. Try not attacking & bombing whole populations 4 gas & oil or to flex muscles. Try not being allies to terrorist countries or to those who fund terrorists. Try not supporting an amoral business reality star who sells bombs 4 jobs.
2971 2018-09-07 17:36:09 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
2972 2018-09-07 17:36:09 Thanks Evan!   I enjoy our constructive criticisms of these unreal markets.
2973 2018-09-07 17:36:05 Same guy who said “we can’t drill our way to better oil prices”?
2974 2018-09-07 17:35:58 Baker Hughes: The U.S. oil rig count declined by two from prior Friday to 860, which is up 104 from year ago. Year-to-date, the oil rig count increased by 113, although of the increase, only one rig has been added since the end of May by oil companies on a net basis.

2976 2018-09-07 17:35:47 i sat down in my income tax class and the girl who sat down next to me whipped out a whole ass bottle of essential oils and has left it open for the entire class, girly this is accounting not a spa put your tea tree oil away

Silver points on a few muskets. Spent most time on a few different types of flags. Gold dot on the finial.
2978 2018-09-07 17:35:30 I replace the mayo with either Greek yogurt or a mashed avocado, and sometimes add sriracha. Also the type of tuna makes a difference (buy tuna in olive oil, not in water)
2979 2018-09-07 17:35:23 Really he has a well old machine - he needs to get some of the oil the “Tin Man” used because what he’s using is not working
2980 2018-09-07 17:35:23 If Trudeau had of spent this $4.5b on kick starting the Hydrogen Economy, Canada would be the envy of the world.  But nope he spent it on the dirtiest oil to produce known to man.  Asia is rapidly moving toward hydrogen,  and Canada wants to send our dirty oil there??? a Joke.

2983 2018-09-07 17:35:16 Does (accidentally) flushing a bottle of expensive Elemis skin oil down the loo count as reasonable grounds for divorce? Asking for potentially soon to be ex-husband.
2984 2018-09-07 17:35:10 The oil barons won't put one red cent into that.
2985 2018-09-07 17:35:10 @GarethSoloway Do you know what the hell is going on with the oil and gold markets today? There is some kind of crazy bot trading or algorithms or something going on, it's the weirdest price action i've ever seen

2990 2018-09-07 17:34:25 @donbraid opponents of the pipeline don't want better spill response, they want less oil and for there to not be spills. If the pipeline comes through everybody pays. BC is burning every year now.

3003 2018-09-07 17:33:28 His approach is like telling people there are a million residents who can’t afford heat and then increasing the tax on heating oil. I know he didn’t start the policy, but he’s the one pointing out an issue in the state and then letting the problem get worse.

3022 2018-09-07 17:32:06 Well, it's about what can be accomplished in terms of humanitarianism and realpolitik at this juncture. Depriving Assad of oil, choking off (or at least endangering) Iran's land-bridge, creating a stable "autonomous" zone in the NE... It won't save Idlib, but it's not nothing.

3026 2018-09-07 17:31:41 Good point, although they keep finding new sources for oil (and substitutes) so less rivalrous than advertised.

3044 2018-09-07 17:28:56 The assumption that this has everything to do with transporting methods and nothing with cost of production is mind boggling. It is the most expensive of all the marketed oil sources on earth. If Canada refined the oil for the project, I would be more for it but still opposed.

I'm +- addicted to macadamia oil.
MUCH better than olive oil!
In stead of cream, on fruit salad.
On ALL food, loads of it.
As moisturizer for face, nails, body.
Have used extensively +- 10 years, but fussy about specific brand.

3051 2018-09-07 17:28:23 havent you tried it..it is their local drink. Really moorish.
I think she will gush soon enough. You will be checking in Im sure.
3052 2018-09-07 17:28:11 Yes. Britain was willing to sacrifice the whole of eastern Nigeria inorder to keep Nigeria as one. Their economy took a heavy hit after participating in 2 world wars (I & II). The royal Niger company had been mining oil for 60 yrs before publicised discovery of oil in 1956.
3053 2018-09-07 17:28:07 Keto has this thing called bulletproof Coffee which is like Coffee + Coconut  Oil and Milk. I don't drink Coffee so I decided to try it with black tea.

3058 2018-09-07 17:27:30 So, as and when oil companies increase the price of petroleum products, state government should decrease the taxes to bring retail price to the previous rate ?

3073 2018-09-07 17:26:18 U can only buy Oil in USD!
So if USD strengthens against the INR (apart fm any production cut back &hedging which makes it worse) the cost of Petrol/diesel goes up. Right?
Since INR has weakened against USD the rupee looks weak regardless how it does against other currencies?

3083 2018-09-07 17:25:37 Another, more worrying scenario is:
England invades Scotland to keep hold of oil, power and food. 
They've done it in the past and they will be really desperate knowing they are going down the stank.

3094 2018-09-07 17:24:58 Novel idea, why don’t we credit Tesla for kickstarting EVs, but also acknowledge that challenger brands like Hyundai have something to offer. It’s the big, slow-moving beasts like Ford & Toyota that seem to be struggling to turn the ‘oil tanker’

3099 2018-09-07 17:24:34 Posting anything TO bots, regardless the number of followers, is almost pointless, usually futile.

How many kids did you cage today? How’s the new oil well in your fishin’ hole doing?
3100 2018-09-07 17:24:33 I will advise you to go into oil and gas business.
3101 2018-09-07 17:24:25 @WilkowMajority the lack of available hires in oil in North Dakota is slowing the growth here.  It’s that bad.  The number of openings are in the thousands.  #demsaredumb
3102 2018-09-07 17:24:24 mah oil came 
3103 2018-09-07 17:24:13 They put oil in the fire........
3104 2018-09-07 17:24:13 What's a shower oil?
3105 2018-09-07 17:24:12 I just made mayonnaise. Me. Myself. Moi! I glanced at a recipe and to my utter shock I had all the ingredients.
Didn't use a measuring jug(extra dishes,who needs them),so the amount of oil might have been a taaaaaad off...but it was really tasty. Rich, but tasty.
3106 2018-09-07 17:24:02 The oilsands are not an abomination. We continue to work hard to reduce the environmental impact.  Shutting down the oil sands would have minimal impact on oil demand or CO2 emissions, as we would simply buy it from places with far worse environmental results and regulations.
3107 2018-09-07 17:23:56 They also want more 18-year-olds to fight and die in worthless oil wars were the only winners are the wealthy elites.
3108 2018-09-07 17:23:55 So the Mechanic at work did a service on my bosses truck tire rotation an oil change  .. so this mf drivin down the road and his tire flies off . I’m sorry but I fkn died when he told us 
3109 2018-09-07 17:23:50 Waiting around in a car vat of oil and blood and being good morally. Is someone else will have to do good and rescue you.
3110 2018-09-07 17:23:41 My body need a detox, I been water fasting, only coconut oil when I fry my plantain

3112 2018-09-07 17:23:35 it looks really lovely . The sea is blue and the village I would love to walk around there.
3113 2018-09-07 17:23:35 at what point are people going to figure out that snake oil isn't working
3114 2018-09-07 17:23:33 Professor: We’re not robots, we all don’t sit here and calculate our response; we act based on emotion. We’re human after all, right?
Me in the back leaking motor oil: Affirmative.
3115 2018-09-07 17:23:31 @AndrewBellBNN Correction, oil rig activity fell 18; gas rig activity was down 6
3116 2018-09-07 17:23:24 Riyadh oil money talks!
3117 2018-09-07 17:23:16 Barrack is the original Divider in Chief wants a end to our great country how do you do that divide and conquer he promises everything and delivers on nothing just ask our great black communities he is a snake oil salesman don’t fall for it #walkaway
3118 2018-09-07 17:23:14 academic credentials are not reflective of wisdom or rationality

Harvard/oxbridge tags mean zilch

Just a few days ago a Harvard idiot claimed that coconut oil is pure poison.

Now we know he was running that propaganda because indian coconut oil exports had surged this fiscal
3119 2018-09-07 17:23:08 they found oil on my pawpaw landddd
3120 2018-09-07 17:23:05 @FoxNews The man with the snake oil is at it again.The problem, there are those who will believe him. He is trying to own what is happening with our economy now. After all, it is what he did.  I'm doing all I can to not vomit.
3121 2018-09-07 17:23:01 A key lesson on #ExtractivesInEA must be that it needs new forms of consent-based politics, to reduce the risk of oil-driven strife, both sabotage and illegal refining that have plagued Nigerian oil in the Delta region adding to the oil pollution ~ @cobbo via @AfricaExplainer
3122 2018-09-07 17:22:58 cuz isnt it just hemp seed oil
3123 2018-09-07 17:22:53 酷いですよねこんな深夜に
3124 2018-09-07 17:22:48 Haven't been for a few years but been about 8 times in total. Staying in an apartment so will be trying all the local tavernas...yum!!
3125 2018-09-07 17:22:42 No I have found that out , one was sitting on the conker if you please! Others swear by Peppermint oil left in corners, I suppose that’s rubbish too??
3126 2018-09-07 17:22:35 This oil change is taking way longer than what it should 
3127 2018-09-07 17:22:34 I figure with all their terrif bs going on that we would stop selling our gas and oil to the states. We could keep it for Canadians and maybe we wouldn’t have to take a mortgage out to pay for gas.
3128 2018-09-07 17:22:27 Lizard and palm oil
3129 2018-09-07 17:22:06 Definitely the end. Strang lay enough, US emissions are way down since withdrawing from the Paris Accord & ramping up oil production.
3130 2018-09-07 17:21:47 Its like they want the country to he disqualified, cos Uban kowa zamuchi
3131 2018-09-07 17:21:44 This is specific to the Williston Basin in Montana but the concerns and issues would apply similarly to towns in CO. Instead the state should be focusing on Solar and Wind power jobs because oil and coal are going to run out and CO is a gorgeous land that could easly support them
3132 2018-09-07 17:21:34 What is your point?

We still don’t need to eat meat but we do
We don’t need to use cars but we do
We don’t need to use natural resources like coal & oil but we do

Once you stop partaking in those actions then you can call other people piece of shit scumbags for wearing fur
3133 2018-09-07 17:21:31 Let me get this oil change....
3134 2018-09-07 17:21:20 Yes, fish oil beans
3135 2018-09-07 17:21:09 @AndrewBellBNN Arguably in response to the TransMountain decision last week, Canadian producers idled 20 oil and 4 gas rigs over the past week... a one-week, 10.5% reduction in activity.  Total active rigs in Canada fell to 204.  Ouch!!
3136 2018-09-07 17:21:07 NO MORE BIG OIL GOP PAYOFFS!!
VOTE BLUE IN 60 DAYS!!
3137 2018-09-07 17:21:06 What make you think vets were serving the country?  They were serving the oil and defense industries and creating more terrorists by committing crimes against humanity.
3138 2018-09-07 17:20:47 Money received from the sale of oil is a petrodollar. Your point being?
3139 2018-09-07 17:20:45 I need to take this oil back thats 14 right there
3140 2018-09-07 17:20:38 However,.....Libya was awash in oil $$$$....w/ rather low population.  So, they could afford to splurge.
3141 2018-09-07 17:20:28 Why the eff does @FoxNews give this snake oil salesman any more air time?  He’s not in the WH any more,  he’s nothing.  Nothing.
3142 2018-09-07 17:20:24 And what do u think about falling Rupee, rising oil prices, falling GDP, increasing unemployment. Since u seem so knowledgeable dared to ask this to a Bhakt.
3143 2018-09-07 17:20:20 I'll be working on sex-ed via fanfictions, count on me to make a whole section on the "[something] as lube" tag lmao. But yeah, sometimes it's like "frying oil" or "peanut butter" and it freaks me out xD

We stan writers who tag correctly their works
3144 2018-09-07 17:20:19 Venezuela's economy was market-based and private-sector dominated throughout Chavez's time in office, even though social economy and public sector was promoted. It remained undiversified and completely dependent on oil prices. So it wasn't just 'socialism'.
3145 2018-09-07 17:20:17 Neutrogena oil free ! It has salicylic acid to help with breakouts
3146 2018-09-07 17:20:10 @realDonaldTrump Your government has a duty not to allow any entity or bank to deal with the terrorist regime in Iran, there is no exemption from the sanctions on oil and banking. Violations of sanctions are not forgiven.
3147 2018-09-07 17:20:09 I can read your car, prob need an oil change tbh
3148 2018-09-07 17:20:07 “You ain’t got anymore oil sheen yet”

3151 2018-09-07 17:19:57 Just saying this in advance; There will be lots of accusations of "Big Oil" killing Tesla. 

In reality, Elon could enter Tesla into chapter 11 bankruptcy right now and thus save Tesla. $TSLAQ
3152 2018-09-07 17:19:57 going to look it up. So you go regular Im guessing. Hotel or Villa ?

3159 2018-09-07 17:19:21 I’ve been convinced that the Middle East is in turmoil forever as a matter of foreign policy. Confusion rules. Curtis has a neat take on it. He saw it as a deal that was cut between FDR and the Kingdom. We get oil. They keep Wahhabism.
3160 2018-09-07 17:19:18 Time for an oil change.
3161 2018-09-07 17:19:14 @johnmcternan @lbc @toryboypierce I've never heard such an anti Corbyn diatribe, full of fantasy and down right lies. You really should vote Tory, you complete loser and peddler of snake oil. #lbc #fakenews
3162 2018-09-07 17:19:07 It worries me that I realise how susceptible I am to fall for this kinda stuff (that Comey and Mueller hugging and kissing stuff yesterday)...I fear it may be tantamount to throwing oil on a fire

3170 2018-09-07 17:18:02 Dotard:  the great snake oil salesman of the 21st century.    I am hopeful, not much, that his “base” will discover the abundant lack of character of this man which I discovered at age 16 in the year 1984.
3171 2018-09-07 17:18:02 Every family has that one ointment used as a cure-all first aid for cuts, bruises, or bites. My aunt's is coconut oil; ours is boroline 
3172 2018-09-07 17:17:55 The Ingredients:

- 1 tp of castor oil
- 2 capsules of vitamin e
- 1tp of emu oil
- 1/2 tp of coconut oil 
3173 2018-09-07 17:17:52 When is he going to start taking oil from the Middle East?
3174 2018-09-07 17:17:50 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for an all-kale diet, and put some chai essential oil in my diffuser.
3175 2018-09-07 17:17:45 Gotta get an oil change, pick up meds, play Sims 4, write up a resume
3176 2018-09-07 17:17:41 Why? Oil is what produces them, it produces all the plastic they are made of, oil is what ships them, and oil is what produces most of the electricity to charges them. They are not sustainable without Federal subsidies, they will fail all by themselves, no need to cheer
3177 2018-09-07 17:17:29 we are dependent 80% on OIL imports, and their prices are also rising touching almost 80$. you can check the kind of shoot up in Fiscal deficit for this reason. so no the adjustments in import export and dollar price in noway nearly good enough to offset it.
3178 2018-09-07 17:17:29 32! Wow! We're staying in Kassiopi. Hence my name Kassiopidreamin. Love it there
3179 2018-09-07 17:17:22 Charisma over substance, facts or character. That’s what Obama offered/offers.  Nothing but a slick snake oil salesmen
3180 2018-09-07 17:17:22 Hate that one of my trucks deadass was a bulk stop for the oil fields in Taft fuck I hate loading that shit
3181 2018-09-07 17:17:19 One time i was so high i tried to check my oil by putting the dip stick where you pour the oil into the engine ...

3183 2018-09-07 17:17:15 i can sacrifice for a day. just use frytol and fry pepper in the oil. i will eat and go to hospital
3184 2018-09-07 17:17:12 This one has been way off the rails for a while.
3185 2018-09-07 17:17:00 Most of the folks here are forgetting that crude  oil was over 100 dollars compared to 80 dollars now.

3189 2018-09-07 17:16:28 Who knows what's in them to make them so irresistible?! Presumably a lot of fish oil and other unmentionables  She's managed to eat a whole pack of them though 
3190 2018-09-07 17:16:26 This month over 100 parcels of #publicland will be auctioned off for oil & gas exploration and extraction. This Tues (9/11) we'll be protesting outside the #BLM #Utah State Office from 12-1 PM. Can you join us? #utpol

3194 2018-09-07 17:16:12 I never said that. Judging others without knowing the whole story makes you kind of foolish! Sometimes people form alliances with others to overthrow a regime. Assad wasn't so popular and they wanted oil/gas pipelines. If he was a jihadi, that's news to me.
3195 2018-09-07 17:15:58 Every time you speak, you remind people of the disaster you left behind, you snake oil salesman. Very helpful during midterms, thanks.
3196 2018-09-07 17:15:56 i use coconut oil religiously
3197 2018-09-07 17:15:47 It was the same with NI. All current account spending, no pot built up. Same with North Sea Oil/Gas. They’re useless, the lot of them.
3198 2018-09-07 17:15:41 I've heard it's really drying on combination/dry skin but mine is crazy oily so it absorbs so much of the oil off my face. I've never been happier with a product (except I got a shade that's a bit too dark so I'm going to sample the lightest and mix them and hope for the best )
3199 2018-09-07 17:15:29 Whats worse for the climate change, constructing pipe lines to safely and quickly transport oil, or keep doing what were doing and transporting by train and truck? Id say pipeline is a short term pain for long term gain environmentally. Couple that with economic reasons...
3200 2018-09-07 17:15:29 Bout to go get this oil change for my baby and run some errands. Being able to take a day off when needed is awesome. Love my career

3209 2018-09-07 17:14:01 Why do not anybody advocate curtailment in fuel consumption. When we have to be dependent on other countries for oil supplies and they keep on increasing oil prices ,the only alternative is to reduce at least 10 to 15% oil consumption which will zero in price increase.

3247 2018-09-07 17:10:36 And Oil Ministry has already urged government to bring fuel prices under GST, however not much has even been said on that front, leave alone action taken.

So for now, Indian fuel prices continue to rise, and consumers are facing the brunt.

3256 2018-09-07 17:10:14 Wouldn't any government have done that "baap ka karz" and all if they bought oil at a cheaper rate and keep the tax rate higher as much as possible to keep the prices at its peak?
3257 2018-09-07 17:10:13 Exxons Hammerhead connects to ECOs Latuk "same play"

This gets better and better, Exxon has shot seismic over ECOs block that confirms that Hammerhead continues over into Latuk !

This means that ECO now has oil confirmed and probably like 60 meters play like Hammershead.
3258 2018-09-07 17:10:12 if you wonder why? because Americans debts hit all time high and before government goes bankrupt they need to steal to recover.

3272 2018-09-07 17:08:36 Year 2012. Global Crude Oil price $97 per barrel. Petrol ₹69.99

Year 2018, Global Crude Oil price $67 per barrel.  Petrol ₹79.22

The only difference is... 

In 2012, Modi had someone to blame. 

In 2018  Modi is to blame.

3280 2018-09-07 17:07:51 Bingo and that is exactly why we are seeing all these unfounded attacks. Did you see his model3 sales vs. the competition last month or for the year for that matter! Wow! Big oil isn’t happy I’m sure.
3281 2018-09-07 17:07:47 And the countries with oil, the countries with authoritarian-type governments, and countries where Trump and/or his cronies have business interests and see allegiance as a method of making bank.

3374 2018-09-08 23:57:27 This beauty blogger said to use almond oil under ur eyes n on ur eyelashes n now it feels like my eyes r committing suede of cider
3375 2018-09-08 23:57:25 I burned the crap out of my hand with hot oil and I want to vomit
3376 2018-09-08 23:57:21 Theodore Roosevelt broke up Standard Oil & the railroad monopolies—@realDonaldTrump is a corporate tool. @CLewandowski_
3377 2018-09-08 23:57:10 I actually admired @ChukaUmunna & what he stood for a few years ago but unfortunately I don’t recognise what he’s become. I feel sorry for the Labour Party. It’s become a party saddled with self serving snake oil salesmen & women who choose self over party over country.
3378 2018-09-08 23:56:51 There are many health benefits to it. We have a cream made from CBD oil and thc that is great for muscle pain.

3380 2018-09-08 23:56:23 Lunch for me; Oven roasted russet potatoes, carrots, and corn on the cob in olive and toasted sesame oil, boiled unseasoned collard greens on the side. Starbucks Veranda beans brewed in my Mr Coffee. Poor Oliver got diet dog food again.
3381 2018-09-08 23:56:06 Yeah...and we love that these people are trying to save American Democracy from the beast in the WH, the corrupt GOP, a tin horn dictator supported by big oil.

3386 2018-09-08 23:55:13 Yeah CBD oil is everywhere here. Bunch of people I know opening up even more shops,
3387 2018-09-08 23:54:59 Yes. And, no, not a big fan of oil
3388 2018-09-08 23:54:51 I’m going back to castor oil. My hair is so nappy I think it needs it
3389 2018-09-08 23:54:38 I take BCAAs (whey), creatine, fish oil, aspirin.
3390 2018-09-08 23:54:28 DT, if you make our soldiers fight Israel's War against Syria and Iran for the great oil and land grab prize for Israel and the Rothschild oil syndicate, you will lose the support of your core constituency.  Remember your promise : America first.
3391 2018-09-08 23:54:25 “Can”. Also, socialist regimes have slaughtered 100 million people ... with just bullets to the back of the neck, famine.
3392 2018-09-08 23:54:24 Where can I get a good oil change? Someplace that doesn’t tax!
3393 2018-09-08 23:54:11 น่อววววว ทำไมมีเด็กปุ่นด้วยยย
3394 2018-09-08 23:54:05 Some of it was high cost per volume (wine, four kinds of cooking oil, Hot Wheels which are kind of for my daughter but also kind of for me). But also milk, sweet potatoes, celery! Proud of my weight distribution.
3395 2018-09-08 23:54:01 What? Snake Oil? Or Cancer? #Insiders
3396 2018-09-08 23:53:32 Oil change Monday morning 
3397 2018-09-08 23:53:28 This amla oil stinks man. 
3398 2018-09-08 23:53:24 Another reason we need the oil industry.

3401 2018-09-08 23:53:04 I'm in charge now: let's sell the strategic oil reserve to the Japanese. Either that, or put it on eBay

3404 2018-09-08 23:52:38 The smell of castor oil 
3405 2018-09-08 23:52:36 Now they tax cow farts....15 cents per kilowatt hour NG and oil 2.00/kw hour best solar known- regualr replacement part cost.  Who likes replacement parts?  People who make cheap parts in other countries force our government to subsizdize them + steal our technology. What a ruse.
3406 2018-09-08 23:52:03 ん？クチバシティ？
3407 2018-09-08 23:52:02 If the oil price is currently $77 a barrel, why would any want to buy it at $180? This is the lowball estimate to produce Venezuelan heavy oil, which is why it will remain forever in the ground.
3408 2018-09-08 23:51:53 ugh i wanna drink this castor oil but i’m scared  but i’m also miserable and tired too
3409 2018-09-08 23:51:48 Woof thank u. Mom has been keeping me on short walks and giving me supplements and yucky  fish oil. she watches my every move!  I overheard Mom say I’m starting on Adequan next week and hydrotherapy later this month. She hopes I like it.  How r u fur pals?
3410 2018-09-08 23:51:38 Afganistan has the largest concentration of natural oil and opiate fields in the world.
3411 2018-09-08 23:51:27 Making war for oil. Was bush that was the past. Now US gets oil from Canada mainly in trade. The US does not control the economies alone it is with its allies as well as the European Union.      all say soccer. Same sport 
3412 2018-09-08 23:51:26 How long should an oil change take a regular man to do? Personally myself I'd say 15-20 minutes walmarts at 40 and still isnt done 
3413 2018-09-08 23:51:26 He gives strength to the weary!

3415 2018-09-08 23:50:59 18 yo (1998). Dragged my dad's old automatic turntable down from the top of the hall closet then went and bought 2nd hand copies of Led Zeppelin 'IV', Midnight Oil 'Blue Sky Mining' and Prong 'Cleansing'.
3416 2018-09-08 23:50:54 "He began his career in the oil industry with Royal Dutch Shell," says it all, really.
3417 2018-09-08 23:50:49 I've heard snake oil is actually very good for the skin. At the very least, it's a great cooking accompaniment. I've had cancer that was more appealing the #LNP #Insiders
3418 2018-09-08 23:50:46 oil cream
3419 2018-09-08 23:50:35 What would get Havana to budge? They'll be fearful and seek to prevent attempts to dislodge them from the "fuel tank" that has given them lots of free oil over the years.
3420 2018-09-08 23:50:21 Is that...grape juice????
3421 2018-09-08 23:50:05 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
3422 2018-09-08 23:49:54 So that nonsense about make America great again rang hallow, from that snake oil salesman

3425 2018-09-08 23:49:12 Watching Lynyrd Skynyrd on MTV live. Just love this band. Saw them in 1975 with the outlaws. At the Hollywood Palladium with Chuck. Got some free honey oil that day up at Griffith Park Observatory. Good times and free drumsticks!
3426 2018-09-08 23:49:04 A Cirque du Soleil performance in Washington state ended abruptly when a hose on a hydraulic system broke and sprayed audience members with what the theatrical company says was vegetable-based oil.
3427 2018-09-08 23:48:46 آفریدی نے نسوار کو لونگ اور سونف کا نام دے دیا

Meanwhile from liquor to olive oil and honey
3428 2018-09-08 23:48:32 My Syrian friends have said about 10 bases. Most located near the oil resources.
3429 2018-09-08 23:48:13 you just raised a viable point-
we have the worlds reserve currency as ours-
when you do--those who hold it control you-
oil exists-
we can't economically manufacture it-
so we buy cheap overseas-
and the other guy spends our currency for oil-
we're Islam's mercenaries-
3430 2018-09-08 23:48:03 No one wants your snake oil.
3431 2018-09-08 23:47:52 Oil or gas pe aap kuch nahi bol rahe ho abhi tak sasta he lag raha hai aapko Congress ke time bhut manga tha oil or gas kuch to bolo ya tweet Karo
3432 2018-09-08 23:47:17 Not everyone needs money like y’all. You ain’t professional you’re just a snake oil salesman, lol.
3433 2018-09-08 23:47:14 Oil was part of it but the comment was too long to post it all.
3434 2018-09-08 23:47:14 CBD oil (cock and ball dorture oil)
3435 2018-09-08 23:47:05 Also infuse some vegetable oil! Makes for excellent vinaigrette that way
3436 2018-09-08 23:47:04 World oil prices tend to fluctuate and, in the long term, it is a lot better to have oil reserves than not to.

Now #US wants to get reserves that exceed #Saudi’s under their thumb simply by a good old fashioned #CIA coup. I am sure it will be sold to us as “human rights” issue.
3437 2018-09-08 23:46:58 @jiffylube have the manager from Boston RD In Bronx, NY call ne regarding replacing this engine ASAP. Others beware. I lost my engine bc they did not secure the oil cap.

3441 2018-09-08 23:46:00 From pumping oil, to pumping ass 
3442 2018-09-08 23:45:51 Hmm so to solve the overheating issue with my phone...I need to stick it on my oil fin heater until it overheats enough to boot.
3443 2018-09-08 23:45:51 That’s good to know!!! I love French fries and the oven doesn’t get them crispy enough and frying in oil can make them too soft
3444 2018-09-08 23:45:45 Do they ever find lost baggage containing fancy olive oil flying beside them?
3445 2018-09-08 23:45:20 Interesting.  
Chemically, lavender oil seems more than a placebo.
I wonder why they used that?
A quick browse thru NCBI for lavender and immune finds studies.
3446 2018-09-08 23:45:04 Because the synthetic oil that I get lasts for 7500 miles. Lol
3447 2018-09-08 23:44:58 First shop at Iceland last week for Palm free products. Back for more this week, great range of labelled products. Noticed that Iceland Cheese & Onion Pasties are not yet Palm Oil free. @IcelandFoods #boycottpalmoil

3450 2018-09-08 23:44:27 How is this different to what the Western Governments have been doing. They target mostly Shiaa Muslims at the directions of Saudi Arabia. Why? Cheap oil from Sunny Saudi Arabia!!
3451 2018-09-08 23:44:14 QUICK QUESTION: who does oil treatments for their hair? 
3452 2018-09-08 23:43:49 Can you do a lot of dairy? Obviously butter is dairy, but I used to make a cup in the morning of heavy whipping cream, a packet of Truvia, (or 2 sometimes) and a Tablespoon of unrefined coconut oil. It was heavenly. Tasted like warm coconut ice cream.
3453 2018-09-08 23:43:37 People don't realise he was a clown put in power by the MIC, Elite US Oil interests and S.A and is nothing but a well spoken enabler for the rich. 
Did he do anything  to improve the lives of the poor? The homeless,  the workin class or African Americans. If so enlighten me.
3454 2018-09-08 23:43:23 Been on the go all day.  Went to work, oil change fall decor now maybe 
3455 2018-09-08 23:43:18 when it comes to moisturizing try oils in you can buy in glass bottles. argan oil for hair. jojoba and rosehip seed for face. almond oil for the body, or make your own Shea butter lotion. Order/buy in bulk to reduce waste.
3456 2018-09-08 23:43:18 They can't do anything about the fuel hike. #PetrolPriceHike #fuel #Diesel #petrol #FuelShortage #gas #FuelPriceHike #oil #oilprice so what the need of governance #ModiMadeDisaster
3457 2018-09-08 23:43:01 A little oil in the mix to keep it loose and help with the cooking? Other than that it looks good.
3458 2018-09-08 23:42:58 Bring the oil
3459 2018-09-08 23:42:44 Ah yes, I remember hearing about this now. I've even seen people attaching a small sponge near the extruder intake with a dab of oil on it.

3465 2018-09-08 23:41:11 What if I just injected essential oil into my jugular
3466 2018-09-08 23:40:55 Once a week microwave 2 tablespoons of coconut oil and massage in the scalp then the rest of your hair and it will not just grow fast I will also grow healthy and soft
3467 2018-09-08 23:40:53 I’m doing a cocunut oil hair mask thing and my dog keeps trying to lick my hair LMAO
3468 2018-09-08 23:40:50 It may have the largest proven oil reserves, but they are simply too unaffordable to produce.

3477 2018-09-08 23:40:11 The big rich.  I think burrow is the author. Story about the start of oil in Texas.  Absolutely fantastic.

3481 2018-09-08 23:37:13 Pro car tip #27 allow your car to almost run completely out of oil before topping up to skip that expensive oil change knowing you gave the engine a good cycle
3482 2018-09-08 23:36:47 God help us if this is what the American people think a good leader is. Donald you are a corrupt snake oil salesman.
3483 2018-09-08 23:36:32 But we have full control of their oil now, surely that is an achievement?

Joking obviously
3484 2018-09-08 23:36:21 Just trying to refute the benefits of cocnut oil remember everything in moderation except foods full of chemicals
3485 2018-09-08 23:36:20 It’d be like Grenada, which was a warm-up for regime changing other non-US friendly states like Panama & the ongoing 2nd Gulf War. Venezuela has oil so that’s the main incentive. It was v wealthy & populated by foreign oil companies like Texaco when I was there in the 90s
3486 2018-09-08 23:35:59 What an exciting time to be alive! The Lord is moving through people like He never has before! The Lord is starting a fresh new harvest season! Come get your oil! The bridegroom is coming! Don’t let your spirit sleep in this season!
3487 2018-09-08 23:35:46 I’m not going to lie, go ahead and do that hot oil treatment you been keeping under the sink
3488 2018-09-08 23:35:37 I am watching The War by Ken Burns and it’s about the American perspective on WW II. Of course there’s the bs about “the war wouldnt have been won without the US”. He better touch on the US selling arms, cars and oil to the gd enemy too pre-1941.
3489 2018-09-08 23:35:35 Yeah, this is the first time I"ve ever bought one of those packs! We cut them up and baked them in olive oil & spices. The Vulcan just took them out of the oven!
3490 2018-09-08 23:35:34 I have never heard a Canadian speak ill of their health care. The problem in US is that the big insurance companies, like oil and big banks have got Republicans by the balls.
3491 2018-09-08 23:35:24 Elizabeth May and the Green Party have enough oil for themselves and don't care if anyone else does.
3492 2018-09-08 23:35:16 Use caster oil and coconut oil
3493 2018-09-08 23:34:47 Got FIU +110 today, then line changed so much I also got ODU +135.

I am the Fram oil filter man.
3494 2018-09-08 23:34:36 I saw a porn vid where the top almost used bike oil by mistake so apparently that’s a thing
3495 2018-09-08 23:34:31 Vitamin E oil really helps grow out your lashes and brows. Get on that
3496 2018-09-08 23:34:13 That would be a Maryland candle, Delaware needs a to be oil refineries and trees.
3497 2018-09-08 23:34:03 Remember that weight loss pill that made orange oil come out of your behind, often at random moments? My poor friend was a school teacher. Fourth graders can just be brutal about stuff like that.
3498 2018-09-08 23:33:56 Texas is sitting on oil.  It has absolutely nothing to do with tea party Cruz
3499 2018-09-08 23:33:52 Depends on the brand. Good measure is to make sure there is some oil on the dipstick when not screwed in.

3502 2018-09-08 23:33:01 My policy?

Lift the dumb ass trade sanctions, buy back the bonds we've been stealing their oil with, and stop hosting military coups in their (and their neighbors) country.

But idk, I guess maybe that's just me.
3503 2018-09-08 23:32:51 After the 1970s oil crisis, lots of restrictions were placed on economic migration. This was at the behest of the trade unions, who wanted to limit immigration to control the supply of labour and keep wages up.
3504 2018-09-08 23:32:42 Was it better than the olive oil??!!! 
3505 2018-09-08 23:32:38 Basic stuff EVERYONE should know or at least try to learn to do.

3523 2018-09-08 23:28:49 Actually it makes sense. Oil and having one big client state at the heart of Middle East. The Cost would be high though. Kurds and by extension Israel would have to fight 4 countries (Turkey, Iran, Iraq and syria) to achieve autonomous Kurdistan. Impossible.

3531 2018-09-08 23:26:52 We have interfered, killed and destroyed the middle east to get oil for 100 years. We don't mess with Africa why? Because they have no oil. We have to take responsibility for what our policies have been and try to fix them. Violence will only create violence.

3550 2018-09-08 23:20:58 Santa Barbara had a dramatic oil spill in the 60s or 70s. Our gas prices have been the highest in our nation. Every two years (election cycles), the state has f'd up our citizens.  A norm as l person cannot afford to live here. Only foreigners and illegals can afford to live here
3551 2018-09-08 23:19:59 Ramping up debt for infrastructure to grow economy is valid. The non oil exports need rail, roads, and power. It's hard to see a way out if we follow this analysis..since the naira has plunged due to lack of productivity

3660 2018-09-08 23:00:48 The economy started turning around 2008-10.  Look it up.  Numbers don't lie.  And the economy just keeps getting better.  But fossil fuel industries are dying (coal and oil). America once again is going to have to catch up. Germany and Sweden's energy, and more, is >70% renewable

3662 2018-09-08 23:00:27 I was supposed to change my cars oil last month on the 11th 
3663 2018-09-08 23:00:19 Like a vampire, he drinks oil out of robots.
3664 2018-09-08 23:00:17 Amazed so I am. Watched NZ play Argentina and the commentator said NZ  had a popn of 4.5M...and she's independent with only sheep as a  commercial resource. How on earth can that be? Scotland with oil,  whisky, tourism, renewables etc can't survive without Union support.  Amazing

3668 2018-09-08 22:59:31 Wow. Keep everything local? Your town must make a lot of wine, coffee beans, cheese, olive oil, ceramics, clothes, chocolate, microwaves, cars, bricks, toothbrushes, cling wrap, bricks, wood, cement, milk, oranges, wool, books, mobile phones, computers, beef, & tractors etc
3669 2018-09-08 22:59:27 So you are saying they erased 1 billion in debt in less than 4 years, after a global oil crisis and that is bad? Nb has no jobs or plan except more debt...I pray for ndp
3670 2018-09-08 22:59:22 I think everyone has a VW story. My ex wife had a brand new 2011 Golf burned oil at an alarming rate. I added a litre every week and there was no leak and no help from VW. So the best thing I did was all the POS.

3675 2018-09-08 22:58:15 I remember being in my 20s and eating what I wanted with no weight gain, I’m now 44 and olive oil on food puts 2lb on me instantly lol
3676 2018-09-08 22:58:06 @wehappyfewgame alright I know I’ve tweeted y’all a lot lately but I’ve submitted a bug ticket already and I literally can’t go more than 100 m away from the lab before it crashes. I can’t take the cod liver oil to Sally because I literally crash every time.

3683 2018-09-08 22:56:25 Don't trust heart doctors, they have been instructed to kill you through false doctrine in universities. Learn natural healing through herbs and vitamins, tea tree oil kills bacteria like MRSA for example
3684 2018-09-08 22:55:58 I roasted 3 medium beats then in my vitamix  3 cloves of garlic, 3 tablespoon of lemon juice 3 tablespoons of extra Virgin Olive oil 1/4 cup of tahini, pinch of sea salt.  Mix until smooth  tasted and adjusted seasoning
3685 2018-09-08 22:55:51 Andrew Scheer's Conservative Party, when you get right down to it, is really only about pleasing America's worst President ever, Donald Trump, oil, more air and water pollution, cutting jobs, covering up election fraud, reducing women’s rights and ignoring federal law. #cdnpoli

3699 2018-09-08 22:53:30 It's pretty rare to see palm oil on the label though, it's usually hidden
3700 2018-09-08 22:53:23  
But 'kose is sweeter immediately after removing it from oil
3701 2018-09-08 22:53:14 Yeah.. obviously.. or maybe it was the military seizure of US interests that caused sanctions.. they were selling the oil for 10 years with US sanctions, until it became too expensive to drill and they had failed to invest in new equipment..

3709 2018-09-08 22:51:25 I see your point, but do they have oil?

Oh, right.
3710 2018-09-08 22:51:24 That meme is missing another line. It should say one of these things the end: 
. . . at willfully misunderstanding others.
. . . at producing bullshit theories made entirely from shitty claims.
. . . at tirelessly selling snake oil ideas.
3711 2018-09-08 22:51:12 They make pretty good oil rags. @LEVIS suck Wear @Carhartt
3712 2018-09-08 22:51:04 Where do you think all our oil money goes. Stockpiling of gifts by SNP for Indy supporters of course.

3715 2018-09-08 22:50:16 I respect people choices but oil and coal companies got and still get taxed less then they should especially since the debate ultimately involves the rest of the world because of global warming, I suggest that the government help the people by doing whats better for us all.

3719 2018-09-08 22:49:48 Sanity is not more government & death, Obama is still selling his snake oil to the feeble minded.
3720 2018-09-08 22:49:24 The oily boid gets the henchmouse. While they read the pamphlet on how to escape the flush of doom, they haven't done so while soaked with water and covered in slippery oil. That trap is easier to maintain than the bucket trap as oil weighs them down and keeps them swimming.
3721 2018-09-08 22:49:23 Take your olive oil and push off.
3722 2018-09-08 22:49:14 When will the oil rich Arab Royal Dictatorships cover the loss of US money to Palestine ?
3723 2018-09-08 22:49:10 Even the oil is drilled by foreign companies. We do nothing other than share the sales proceeds.

3740 2018-09-08 22:46:31 A 'cup' is more accurate than Jamie Oliver's 'lug' of olive oil.

3742 2018-09-08 22:46:20 Just feel like dipping my face in warm water rn , cause dammnn this oil irritating.
3743 2018-09-08 22:46:19 180 million people eating, sleeping and contributing nothing to the world. All we do is drill oil, sell it, bank the money and share the proceeds.
3744 2018-09-08 22:46:16 Trump just wants oil profits. 

So does Putin

None of these individuals care about Venezuela
3745 2018-09-08 22:46:05 Check your Transmission oil this morning.
3746 2018-09-08 22:46:02 Sir was my dad. But really, thank you. It takes a lot to put your life on the line.  Bad eyesight kept me from becoming a pilot so I chose to go to the oil field instead.
3747 2018-09-08 22:45:51 They've been trying to get back control of that oil since Hugo Chavez, if Venezuela's chief export was mangoes and folk art, do you think the USA would be involving itself?  The US has been putting the screws to that country since Chavez took power
3748 2018-09-08 22:45:44 Renault ocean blue, I also used BL Teal blue as good match when repairing bodywork on the one we had. An iffy camshaft finally saw it off, as with many of these I believe. Genuine Renault filters and more regular oil changes was the order of the day to make a 14’s engine last.
3749 2018-09-08 22:45:18 You sure wouldn't know that seeing all of the subsidies/welfare the Texas oil industry gets from the federal government.  THAT is socialism too.
3750 2018-09-08 22:45:05 Oh, wait, not a 'hung over' summer crop, a 'winter greens' crop (which we don't really have in NZ, too cool). Still, ~17% DM translates to unacceptable oil. Unless this is a soluble solids measure with (what ?) oil equivalence?
3751 2018-09-08 22:44:54 Absolutely nothing to do with the US's oil envy...?
3752 2018-09-08 22:44:37 just like the olive, some of you may have felt like you go through the shaking, the beating and the pressing. You've went through all of that for your oil to flow. Now, your greater is coming.
3753 2018-09-08 22:44:24 He knew only God could save him then 
3754 2018-09-08 22:44:16 Yes, a pic of the Last night of the proms with a few EU flags, but no outrage about them is probably the perfect way to start turning that oil tanker around!
3755 2018-09-08 22:44:15 Are you joking? They just seized the bank accounts and property (In Florida) that gov officials in Venezuela STOLE from nationalizing the oil industry. They stole the money and put it in bank accounts in FL, and also purchased property with the money.
3756 2018-09-08 22:44:08 Oh do calm down. Have a cup of chamomile. Lavender oil on your pillow or something. All this 'neo-liberal enforcers' stuff really isn't going to win over the floating voters. Well that, and the racism of course.

3760 2018-09-08 22:43:09 The ONLY way he COULD verify this is because of his nightly talks to Putin, his best  brofriend. May GOD TAKE this RACIST VS OIL & HIS CABINET, that the Russian hacks out in OUR Whitehouse!
3761 2018-09-08 22:43:05 Maybe I'm gonna check out of this planet just in time.
For future gens we expect
*Hotter climate => violence up
*Shortages/unaffordability for water, oil, food, land
*Unchecked foreign intervention to our detriment
*Environmental destruction

3768 2018-09-08 22:42:06 Sugar and an oil is all you need!
3769 2018-09-08 22:42:02 Not really, not advanced enough to not need oil to retain our quality of life. Espesially in Canada. agree we do not need the 20th-century pipeline, but we do have the ablity to build a leak proof pipe system. Then over full gain Silos being moved by truck could move by train.

Have they paid their debt to the countries they have invaded yet?
3802 2018-09-08 22:37:23 I want to be clear, no oil from anywhere. Oil is not the energy the planet needs anymore 
3803 2018-09-08 22:37:13 Yes employees need decent wages no one would argue against, point making is this, when gasoline goes down are the oil companies suddenly feeling generous? When price goes up, they’re now greedy? Market supply & demand my friend for petrol or any other good/service such as Labor!
3804 2018-09-08 22:37:07 Sure
3805 2018-09-08 22:36:49 Canadians are such small minded people. Do women even want jobs in the oil fields? Get a grip leftie Nation!!
3806 2018-09-08 22:36:04 こんな傷であしたワーク行けねぇよ、、、アホですか!
3807 2018-09-08 22:36:02 That article is very biased. The federal government's scientists published over sixty peer-reviewed papers on diluted bitumen. It floats for 3 weeks on salt water depending on conditions. The fear-mongering is not helping with rational debate on these issues. What is big oil?
3808 2018-09-08 22:35:46 First it was the oil industry. Now millennials are destroying the roll industry
3809 2018-09-08 22:35:42 (Wow.. what did the Vatican oil that rosary with? My hands smell like incense!)
3810 2018-09-08 22:35:38 You can just use own brand baby oil, nothing in bio oil other than a nice fragrance. If you prefer it then fair enough but if you bought it because they market it as different to other oil, they liarrrrs.
3811 2018-09-08 22:35:37 "The new olive oil powder contains 1.8% more olives."
3812 2018-09-08 22:35:30 Its Trinidad oil down. Allyuh trademark yours Grenada oil down. Low we nah

But carrots doh belong on top

3816 2018-09-08 22:34:35 trump wants the oil.
3817 2018-09-08 22:34:20 ワオの傷えぐるのやめーや
3818 2018-09-08 22:34:11 No not really, we are not advanced enough to not need oil our quality of life, especially in Canada require not the 20th-century pipe, but a 21st-century leak proof system. Then we have the ablity to move all that grain setting in silo's being moved by truck. Rather than Rail.
3819 2018-09-08 22:34:09 not to be an oil producer like Venezuela, then...

3821 2018-09-08 22:33:36 Your groceries get delivered by an uber like service, self driving or no. Items bought algorithmically. Knows when you're out of milk. Knows/decides what meals you make. 

"Oh, look at that. A new olive oil brand. I liked the other one."
3822 2018-09-08 22:33:34 Does our resources rely on the consumption of foreigners? Do Africans not consume gold? Oil, etc? We are a continent of nearly 2billion people. Do we also need foreigners to grow and export agricultural products amongst ourselves? Do you know anything about the ancient empires?
3823 2018-09-08 22:33:31 I have like this weird fear of looking under the hood of cars. Like checking the engine and oil and shit. I feel like it’s just gonna explode. Don’t ask me why, or how, I’ve just always had this fear.
3824 2018-09-08 22:33:27 Mr Adler prefers to ignore billions in subsidies for the oil industry globally, their rich executives and Pr funds, dirty industry seems pretty and necessary. And the expensive lawyers oil has used since the fifties when they knew their industry would cause climate change
3825 2018-09-08 22:33:23 Charles Brotte: piggy bank filled with Brown & olive oil crackers, garlic & nut mix, chocolate squares, sea salt pasta and blackcurrant

3827 2018-09-08 22:33:01 A Z06 i tried racing yesterday turns out to be the dudes dad that changed my oil today. Small world. We gunna set this race up. The another dude wants a shot with his truck too lol
3828 2018-09-08 22:32:37 if you use oil paint you're either gay or an asshole, and never both
anyway, im starting an oil painting tonight
3829 2018-09-08 22:32:28 Has @Remember_Sarah shown you her ingenious peppermint-oil-tampon-in-the-facemask trick yet? Really seems like the only logical course of action when dealing with such UCK.

3830 2018-09-08 22:32:20 Thanks @JerryBrownGov for signing #SB834 to protect our coasts from offshore oil drilling!

3832 2018-09-08 22:32:07 I swear by @LivingProofInc perfect hair day shampoo for coconut oil hair masks. One shampoo round and that’s it. Completely life changing.
3833 2018-09-08 22:32:03 Didn't you know, all these people are scam artist snake oil salesmen.
3834 2018-09-08 22:31:48 Tell em it's for fracking and drilling for oil.  Or it's to go to war against the evil lava terrorist! 
3835 2018-09-08 22:31:47 It’s had a row with my mum bc my bike oil was on the side and she thought it was lube and had a go at me
3836 2018-09-08 22:31:33 Gee Bernie couldn't pass any bills in a Congress controlled by wall street, the private healthcare & oil industry, & the military industrial complex. I wonder why that is...
3837 2018-09-08 22:31:06 I want my hair to grow a lot more. Probably go and buy back that oil I was using before

3839 2018-09-08 22:30:28 strange that US only "care about the people" of countries with big oil fields 
3840 2018-09-08 22:30:26 Tonight is my 10 year high school reunion. I’m obviously not going. If I wanted that kind of torture I’d submerge myself into a vat of boiling oil. But like, cool for everyone else going if you’re into that sort of thing

3843 2018-09-08 22:29:52 I’ve stopped being angry about not seeing the ND game and have decided to embrace the fact that I’ve learned several new IN/KY towns, like Andyville, Frymire, Sassafrass and Oil.  #Mr #Brightside
3844 2018-09-08 22:29:42 Oil
3845 2018-09-08 22:29:40 Well when gas stations rip us off not unexpected! Christ oil has tanked, gasoline on market has tanked and in Calgary foreign oil screws us by gouging. I don't understand why why co-op screws Calgarians! Too gawd damn much price collusion!!!!!
3846 2018-09-08 22:29:26 Is Nigeria still oil rich ? If so where the hell does all the money go?
3847 2018-09-08 22:28:59 Bc you need an oil change
3848 2018-09-08 22:28:51 let's pump a bunch of water (sand/chemicals) into this shale rock to produce oil which we can refine into petroleum someone can pay for to run to the store to buy a bottle of water
3849 2018-09-08 22:28:45 just applied my lavender essential oil 
3850 2018-09-08 22:28:38 how relatable are you really? here’s the true test: do you take the paper cover seats from the bathroom and use them as oil blotting sheets?
3851 2018-09-08 22:28:32 Sure it is! Because you think his lies filled with hate are real or his conspiracy theories are bible verses or maybe it’s that snake oil that you all buy from him.
3852 2018-09-08 22:28:30 How many people find oil on their property? Sell $90k in stocks in 1 year? 56% finding their way to the top 10% one way or another sounds really dynamic to me. More dynamic than say, utopian Denmark.
3853 2018-09-08 22:28:25 Fake humble and greedy with me is like water and oil 

It’s a NO from me 
3854 2018-09-08 22:28:21 Trump can take all the oil he want
3855 2018-09-08 22:28:10 Glo is pure madness,any serious human being can not use Glo as his hotline
3856 2018-09-08 22:28:10 Got 6 of them in the 160ft crewboat I run in the oil field Gulf of Mexico
3857 2018-09-08 22:27:57 ...which tastes like sump oil.
3858 2018-09-08 22:27:14 3 has its charm. They are in a skyscraper with... an uncle? a stepdad? I'm not sure the relationships as I haven't seen it since I was a kiddo. There was a scene in a parking garage where a puddle, an oil leak from a car... I think someone steps in it and falls through.
3859 2018-09-08 22:26:47 Oh #AGBTph18 Rx targets: could diversify flora, restore oil/pH/moisture balance. Lots of challenges: who to chose as a probiotic organism.
3860 2018-09-08 22:26:24 Yes, potentially. although with Geoscience he's better to look at places with large mining operations. Many of those companies operate in remote areas where they have the same challenge as oil companies recruiting the talent they need. Those same two websites I linked can work.
3861 2018-09-08 22:25:39 Thank you  I actually have one on my channel. The link is in my bio. As for my body, I just use a combo of cocoa butter and coconut oil
3862 2018-09-08 22:25:26 Decades ago, Venezuela was the leader of oil production in the Americas. its economy was booming, one of the worlds largest reserves and maybe still is (I think they use ethanol 4 energy) Unfortunately bad policies, corruption, and well you know how the story goes on from there.
3863 2018-09-08 22:25:26 From what I’ve seen you can just fry it in like soy sauce/sesame oil/whatever
3864 2018-09-08 22:25:26 I can see you are totally committed to our unhinged reality star POTUS, but there are growing numbers of thoughtful patriots who have come to the conclusion that we elected a snake oil salesman. We are not walking away, we are digging in or heels for the good of the USA!!
3865 2018-09-08 22:24:58 Simple 1) a state would have a worse system then the entire country 
2) even then people would still fear it even if it works, again look at the vitamin example people had a chance to stop snake oil salesmen but they didn't why people like liars they say nothing and that's catchy
3866 2018-09-08 22:24:46 Oil & gas industry paid me well for 30+ years and I totally get the absurdity!
3867 2018-09-08 22:24:43 When someone notices that you switched up ur scent of oil that you normally wear. 
3868 2018-09-08 22:24:25 おはようございます(*^^*)
3869 2018-09-08 22:24:01 NAFTA’s a disaster due to protecting Quebec Millionaire Dairy Corps
-NAFTA trys to save Ontario Auto Jobs yet Ont & Que buy Foreign Oil & say no pipeline. 11,000 Alberta, Sask & Maritimes workers lose their jobs. 
BC stalls Pipeline buys more US Oil. Why is Canada a joke?
3870 2018-09-08 22:23:56 My mom just died of pancreatic cancer. I cried out of nowhere while getting my oil changed, at the dr office and while I was getting my nails done!! You'll be apologizing to strangers for the foreseeable future lol. I feel your pain :(
3871 2018-09-08 22:23:46 Completely agree. Turkey has done so much for Syrian ppl, but Turkey’s economy is dire & doubt AKP political elite favour an intervention to save Idlib which will be costly. Turkey also needs Iran & Russia (for oil & trade) to weather economic storm. Expect Erdogan rhetoric only
3872 2018-09-08 22:23:40 I agree,we will need ppl for renewable work.Panels,wind and geothermal are urgently needed. BTW current panel tech self clears snow. So much could have been built for $4.5B, and produce profits immediately. No telling what the oil market will be for dilbit in 2020+. Future calls.
3873 2018-09-08 22:23:26 Great timing for IndyRef2. UDI when SNP is split asunder, the economy is in crisis and the negative growth commission report. Still the oil fund and an Indy bonus might just swing it this time.
3874 2018-09-08 22:23:16 THANK YOU! :)

Please consider a #desalination plant and piping water inland! 

If we can have transcontinental Oil pipelines, we can bring the #CoachellaValley fresh water to alleviate contamination from agriculture runoff.
3875 2018-09-08 22:23:10 If I could fit in a tub I’d be taking a bubble bath rn with tequila and playing whatever is good on Netflix. And the tub has to have jets man, with some eucalyptus oil drops or menthol. Damnit i need a vacation
3876 2018-09-08 22:23:05 Omg dude he is jimin. Do you like him?
3877 2018-09-08 22:23:01 lets tax the oil we send to usa, or help congress impeach trump.
3878 2018-09-08 22:22:46 you refer to an NDP government source?? Lol. Because NO government would project certain numbers to make themselves look better... ever.
Everything still rotates around oil and gas in this province in some form. 
You wanna prop  the NDP for turning around the economy go ahead...

3880 2018-09-08 22:22:34 It all depends on how hot your able to keep your oil, could be as quick as 10-15 mins or could take close to 20-25 mins..once they start floating, start checking
3881 2018-09-08 22:22:24 Maybelline yang ultra fluffy bagus sih tapi cepet banget abis ga kuat  etude drawing eyebrow aja sih mendingan, tapi ini ga terlalu oil proof
3882 2018-09-08 22:22:23 All the unemployment was caused by his backdoor stupid epa regulations to appease his far left !! Employ people building pipe lines, domestic drilling, etc., and look what happens. So much employment is a spin off from oil ! Even the pen pusher who votes demorat ! Housing, etc
3883 2018-09-08 22:22:12 I tried not to laugh at this cause of the oil change joke @ArthurLosee always makes

3885 2018-09-08 22:21:11 People claiming that Elon is only building offworld solutions for the rich are missing the point. ALL new technologies start out prohibitively expensive, but increased demand ensures they are streamlined for mass adoption over time. If you're angry, be angry at Big Oil, not Elon

3904 2018-09-08 22:18:00 I had a little bottle of jasmine essential oil I’ve been using to deal with a cat pee corner that took me some weeks to find so it’s soaked into my hardwood floors of course and now I can’t find the bottle but it’s doing wonders for the smell.
3905 2018-09-08 22:17:58 Yeah. I once stored a whole bunch in oil and had it start bubbling a day later. When I mentioned it on Alt.Folklore.Urban, I was quickly warned not to keep it.

3920 2018-09-08 22:15:02 I'm referring to the oil that is so contaminated with sand that it creates more pollution to process it than other oil.  Just because it's Canadian oil doesn't make it right to continue to use it when it causes so much more harm than other oil.
3921 2018-09-08 22:14:51 The best thing about getting my oil changed is being able to just sit there and people watch.

3923 2018-09-08 22:14:39 Wel my car has been overdue for an oil change by so long it was making noises and ready to explode. But our hood was stuck and no one could open it
3924 2018-09-08 22:14:36 ISLAMOPHOBIA? All arab nations combined have given less aid to Palestine than America. Less than Europe too.
It is almost as though muslim countries prioritise spending their oil money on football clubs and yachts, not charity to the 'Palestinian cause'.
3925 2018-09-08 22:14:32 @Hyundai Another 2.5 hours waiting for a simple oil change...yes I had an appointment but never again getting it done here. Not good to have someone wait this long who has medical issues...hope I don't faint in Hyundai's waiting area.

3933 2018-09-08 22:13:29 Italian cooking is so funny. They’ll say “add a little bit of olive oil” but then the directions will say 1 and a half cups. How is that a little bit
3934 2018-09-08 22:13:25 and when the dems/Obama put the blame on Bush junior, they were even more so outlandish than they are now with Trump.

3945 2018-09-08 22:10:58 So sorry. Take meds, hydrate big time. Rest if u can. A few drops  of peppermint oil on skin.
3946 2018-09-08 22:10:48 We pray and hope so,but we can't continue this way
3947 2018-09-08 22:10:47 #Venezuela is a rich country with a lot of oil. The castro-chavista socialism of the 21st century left the country at this level of humanitarian crisis. @OEA_oficial @hrw @JMVivancoHRW @PE_Espana @europapress @PE_FRANCE
3948 2018-09-08 22:10:33 Because it’s really 4 times the size of Texas & Arizona combined, headed to Cali and don’t want riots to force the world to end consumption of anything “oil” based immediately. Seriously, “why no pictures?” is a simple honest question. & in the time of everyone has a camera: 
3949 2018-09-08 22:10:25 Yikes, #palmoil regulator @RSPOtweets is greenwashing @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s business partner @Indofood. RT to tell the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil to punish Indofood for dealing in exploitation palm oil!

3951 2018-09-08 22:10:18 While I understand #CustomerService standards that emphasize calling a customer by name, while getting my oil changed today, I was addressed first as Mr. Andrews, then Mr. Dietrich, and finally just Stacey. #0for3
3952 2018-09-08 22:10:17 I spent my day digging through wires, I re- wired most of the cars engine harness, it will look better and should perform a lot better. Cleaned the radiator and cooling system, flushed the oil cooler. Now I wait for the block to get back from the machine shop
3953 2018-09-08 22:10:10 My mom is giving my cat CBD oil lmao wtf
3954 2018-09-08 22:10:03 サラダ油は野菜って言ったら変な顔されたよ。サラダってついてるのに本当に馬鹿だなあ。
3955 2018-09-08 22:09:55 Everything these idiot have on them as well as much of what they have IN them is derived from oil and transported by massive oil sucking trucks. 

These Leftists are not smart!

I weep for the future when stupidity like this is lauded!

3957 2018-09-08 22:09:43 How much is oil debt?How are you paying it now..Can you give figures for the last 5 years
3958 2018-09-08 22:09:41 One day later and we finally got that oil change
3959 2018-09-08 22:09:40 After a month of using castor oil. My lashes & brows are getting thicker. 
3960 2018-09-08 22:08:47 Literally  it stops the hair looking greasy and heavy, soaks the oil up
3961 2018-09-08 22:08:37 "Hundreds" went, apparently, however the only review I could find was on wail oil and I'm not clicking on that link.
3962 2018-09-08 22:08:33 neutrogena oil free acne wash literally saved my skin
3963 2018-09-08 22:08:33 imagine that my boyfriend RARELY uses social media, hasn’t uploaded an insta story in what ?? six months ??? and his come back is postin a pic of a bottle of oil @apowers105
3964 2018-09-08 22:08:29 I’m actively working on making myself better and today I bought cbd oil, to start taking to help my anxiety, depression and stress (which has been causing nightmares every night for the past year). I’m just finally glad I can start this process.
3965 2018-09-08 22:08:27 Fed Libs owe @AlexanderDowner for his loyalty: AWB oil for wheat, children overboard, E, Timor, Matthew Joyce. Loyalty over competence is straight out of LIB playbook. However I'm pretty sure he'll get a payback over Papadopoulos, can't wait 
3966 2018-09-08 22:08:09 Don't know! Epsom salts are often added to baths (MgSO4).  Chain of UK health food shops sell Mg chloride spray in an olive oil base..... 
3967 2018-09-08 22:08:03 I keep waiting to see reporting on a Russian oil/Tillerson connection. I think that is its own rabbit hole....

3969 2018-09-08 22:07:42 All the oil rigs are on their way back to the United States of America! Praise the LORD. All the glory to God. Praise God for #TRUMP
3970 2018-09-08 22:07:24 How important is the oil part and also the pain management part?
3971 2018-09-08 22:07:22 yes hi I put coconut oil in my hair yesterday and I’ve washed it three times and it’s still in my hair please send help because I’m approximately two hours away from shaving my head thx have a blessed day
3972 2018-09-08 22:07:17 So today is one of those days, the sky is grey, I drink coffee while I work on some stuff, put some jazz on, I set the aroma diffuser with some peppermint oil, and I am wearing a turleneck. 

 It is this state of mind the one I enjoy the most.
3973 2018-09-08 22:07:15 <living bottle of olive oil
3974 2018-09-08 22:06:50 accidentally sneezed green oil into my mouth  while prepping for bed. I definitely hate it eing sick, even after all this time, can't imagine anyone ever faking this it's the duckiest thing in this universe bleh
3975 2018-09-08 22:06:49 Oil mixed with sand, what’s not to love?
3976 2018-09-08 22:06:30 Sinister #palmoil company @Indofood exploits workers. I want @RSPOtweets to kick the rogue company - and @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s business partner - off its certification scheme & stop supporting exploitation palm oil now! #workersrights
3977 2018-09-08 22:06:26 Oh god, yes. Mine is a 61-plate 159 so not that new, but it don't half hum of hot oil when it completes a purge cycle. It has to be said though, the automated regen it does seems to keep it happy even if it does nobble the fuel consumption when it runs.
3978 2018-09-08 22:06:24 The cheapest new energy today comes from the sun and the wind, not from a pit full of toxic sludge.  The fossil fuel industry is a dead man walking and the most expensive, dirtiest oil will cease production first.   If Alberta is at risk it's due to dumbasses clinging to the past
3979 2018-09-08 22:06:13 When has Kwankwaso turned to Buhari?  Do you see Buhari in the tweet you quoted? 

The qouted tweet is about Mallam Shekarau and Kwankwaso. 

Yasir, always read to comprehend, not to reply.

3988 2018-09-08 22:04:34 Brit when I had really itchy skin I put coconut oil in my bath and layed in there and relaxed for awhile and it really helped and my dry skin went away ..and subsided the itch ..
3989 2018-09-08 22:04:30 Lemme got get a oil change before I fuck my shit up
3990 2018-09-08 22:04:28 He's a snake oil salesman, the member for the 19th century which is what he'd like to take us back to.
3991 2018-09-08 22:04:23 Before that I had moisturized with coconut oil for years. It worked wonders until, again, suddenly my skin was terrible! Like overnight my face decides “hey I don’t like this anymore” and that’s fine. Just gotta go with the flow 
3992 2018-09-08 22:04:18 Det är väl Genie Oil med Lord Rothschild i spetsen som blir otålig med ojlepipelinen som ska gå genom Syrien/Turkiet.
3993 2018-09-08 22:04:13 No I’m going to go take bike wallahi
3994 2018-09-08 22:04:07 Massage a few drops of coconut oil around the eyes to get rid off dark circles.
3995 2018-09-08 22:03:52 WoW. You wouldn't think there would be that many stupid people in Texas. That guy is selling snake oil. They will be the first to cry when their taxes are doubled and their wages go down because illegals will do it cheaper.
3996 2018-09-08 22:03:51 You'll be passing my house now,there's still hold up
3997 2018-09-08 22:03:13 Just ate some pizza that actually had black olives on it. I liked it... I never liked olives (exept of olive oil) before. I guess it's an acquired taste. I'm gettin' old...
3998 2018-09-08 22:03:08 For the last 3 years or so I’ve been using grape seed oil as moisturizer. I’ve always loved it. Left my skin dewy and fresh all day. Was great under makeup. Never made me breakout until recently.
3999 2018-09-08 22:02:39 100
crusher garlic oil
4000 2018-09-08 22:02:34 Ya know pressure and heat turns plastic back into oil... there's a system for that ...nobody has tried it at sea.
4001 2018-09-08 22:02:17 Started playing around with my routine. Switched to honey cleansing(removes dirt and bacteria w/o removing too much natural oil) and I love it. Next I switched to Garnier Moisture Bomb moisturizer. So far my skin’s cleared up a lot! Only been 3 days!
4002 2018-09-08 22:02:03 That's hilarious and completely accurate.
4003 2018-09-08 22:01:59 And when is the unbundling of the PIGB? That bill has been abandoned by Buhari's men cost it favors oil states. My nephew studied geology in Unical, ended up in d police force. He's now a 3 star police officer serving in Delta. This country can reset anybody's destiny abeg.
4004 2018-09-08 22:01:47 Very terrible, I’v been in ikeja since 9 fa.
4005 2018-09-08 22:01:44 The oil breather pipe?
4006 2018-09-08 22:01:36 @VW timing chain tensioner broke on my 2012 GTi, you denied my claim to replace my engine, knowing they were faulty. I jumped through hoops to make the claim as in proving oil changes etc as if that had any bearing on why it occurred. Now there’s a class action lawsuit #forshame
4007 2018-09-08 22:01:31 I said somewhere else no one is responsible for now. It's seasonal employment changes, looming trade talks, booming oil prices... I think next year January would be a good time to point fingers.
4008 2018-09-08 22:01:27 Oh it’s so much effort I’m wearing waterproof mascara too hahaha I do it in steps. Micellar water first to get most of it off then oil cleanser to get the rest haha
4009 2018-09-08 22:01:23 And what’s fuelled it? Very crude oil and even cruder carbohydrates. Impressive numbers yes but human progress?
4010 2018-09-08 22:01:04 Who asked u to go out on Saturday, and it rained,I was having a leadership talk at Unilag today,but I gave up halfway n came back,it was terrible.
4011 2018-09-08 22:00:47 Like drinking rusty sump oil.
4012 2018-09-08 22:00:34 i told shiny her package was in the oil spill just to bully her but as karma my tracking is also never updating again
4013 2018-09-08 22:00:33 So a few weeks ago,camping, I broke out in huge oil pockets all over my forehead. This last week, after they had all finally drained and healed, my forehead and cheeks were covered in tiny Whiteheads.
4014 2018-09-08 22:00:30 おーっす！はよー！今日も頑張ろーぜ！
4015 2018-09-08 22:00:24 You can get the oil cheaper from Amazon.. £28 I think..
4016 2018-09-08 22:00:23 spreading a culture that was increasingly confined to the most backward hell-holes on earth until oil money let it escape
4017 2018-09-08 22:00:15 castor oil! you have to be consistent w it but i put it on my baby hairs, eyelashes and brows and i’ve seen i difference for sure.
4018 2018-09-08 22:00:13 The citizenry of the planet should boycott purchasing gas for one week. OPEC, Mexico and all Oil Producers are artificially increasing Oil Price. It is not worth price at pump. Boycott buying gas for one week and send a message.
4019 2018-09-08 22:00:09 If you're out here Lucas Oil Regional Off-Road Racing Series, Arizona and happen to forget something, never fear #SDHQsupport has your back! Stop by get geared up!
4020 2018-09-08 22:00:03 The Federation of Quebec Maple Syrup Producers has a “Fort Knox” vault of Maple Syrup. A barrel is worth about $1,200 or $2.88 per pound which is 10-18 times the value of U.S. crude oil.

4024 2018-09-08 21:58:57 Gracias a los "sectores populares" que tuvimos presidentes como Toledo, Humala y PPK. Quien iba a pensar que los "sectores populares" apoyarían a un gringo con acento extranjero, con residencias en Coconut Grove y lobista de grandes corporaciones como Hunt Oil y Odebrecht?
4025 2018-09-08 21:58:39 me, 364 days a year: tulsa is a dumb boring city for fools and oil barons

4026 2018-09-08 21:58:38 Obama KNEW exactly where this caravan of oil were and ignored them.
When Russia went to Syria, he destroyed them.
4027 2018-09-08 21:58:23 Do you think Trump supporters have the mental capacity to ever realize how they were sold snake oil?
4028 2018-09-08 21:58:23 50 million on a 1 billion lease sale should have been 10 billion or 10% of the value of the oil.  Then $ set aside for reclamation as you won’t force the oil companies to do it.50 million is good but you’re giving it away.  Pretty sad.50 million is a start but just a trickle
4029 2018-09-08 21:58:23 Someone tell me why in the hell has Ohio made CBD oil illegal?!?! CBD oil helps so many people and honestly is safer than prescribed medication! #CBDoilissafe
4030 2018-09-08 21:58:21 ofcourse fox is trying to bash elon for taking ONE PUFF of weed in a state where it’s legal because he’s the CEO of a company that is against the republican agenda, which is OIL. fucking pathetic LOL
4031 2018-09-08 21:58:14 Sounds yummy.. We consume cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli stir fried in turmeric, ginger, garlic, red onions, cayenne, black pepper, coconut oil n Nigella seeds.. The rare steak is on the side.. yum
4032 2018-09-08 21:57:54 Woods still good just needs a sand down and recoat with butcher block oil.
4033 2018-09-08 21:57:48 "On paper, Basra is one of the richest cities in the world in relation to the production of oil," Amb Faily told NPR. "In reality, people don't see the wealth. They see their integrity in question as a result of government inability to provide basic functions." 1/2
4034 2018-09-08 21:57:47 They're having an industrial revolution based on magical whale oil, which you can use to electrocute people. Or not. You can also just quietly remove the batteries from the large death machines.

4036 2018-09-08 21:57:35 Oof. I know this struggle. Have you heard of using lemon juice? Washing your face in the morning and at night will also eventually control the oil build up.
4037 2018-09-08 21:57:21 Hay trabajadores petroleros, buques petroleros, pozos petroleros, plataformas petroleras, empresarios petroleros, compañías petroleras y más, como en todo el mundo.(oil workers, oil wells, oil platforms, oil ships, oil pipelines, oil contractors, blablabla)

4039 2018-09-08 21:57:08 Every time i bring my car to the dealership to get an oil change i want a new car 
4040 2018-09-08 21:57:06 I use olive oil to moisture my legs and every time I put it on I just laugh about how I’m not a snack but an actual entrée 
4041 2018-09-08 21:57:03 Ameeen. Thank you
4042 2018-09-08 21:56:54 What’s CBD oil ?

4045 2018-09-08 21:56:26 Thanks, I'll look into it It's tough with the conflicting info sometimes. Fortunately I'm buying a lot of non oil based things now anyways. Apparently I have some food sensitivities the biggest one being sunflower. Sunflower oil is in so much. However the debate against

4047 2018-09-08 21:56:24 Yeah, as chelation "therapy" has dropped off bleach has come up to takes its place as the premier snake oil of the autism world. An entire world of nope!
4048 2018-09-08 21:56:09 Cleaning all spills from oil tankers AND ferries or container vessels, is contingent on the response time. New pipeline or not, this is a major step backwards. A hollow "victory" for anti-developmentalists.
4049 2018-09-08 21:56:08 Crude oil prices gonna continue rising
4050 2018-09-08 21:55:55 Dan Allah kaima kayi hakuri hk. Ayi siyasa ba da gaba ba.

4052 2018-09-08 21:55:45 #Obama- he's back selling Snake Oil to everyone that will listen to his nonsense. If he wasn't Afro American no one would listen to a word he says.

4054 2018-09-08 21:55:31 @Glade I despair. What happened to to Plugins Scented Oil Refills for No. 1 Enraptured from your Atmosphere Collection??? They aren’t available anywhere! 
4055 2018-09-08 21:55:29 Put a good sauce for them together and it may change your mind.

Bacon grease from a few strips of cooked bacon
2 tablespoons Brown sugar
1 tablespoon fish oil
2 teaspoon sriracha sauce
1 1/2 teaspoon Lime juice

Cook it down to a sauce and enjoy
4056 2018-09-08 21:55:13 Wetin him for do? Start living like a fugitive in another man's country? His program ended, he graduated, his visa expired. It was an NDDC sponsored scholarship so he returned to Nigeria with the hope of getting a good job in an oil company, one year passed, another followed...
4057 2018-09-08 21:55:10 Should have no shortages with the worlds largest oil reserve. Only one answer for this, politicians offering free stuff, it's called COMMUNISM, it will not work never has worked. Wonder how much US tax money is rolling into Columbia to take care of the communist refugees?
4058 2018-09-08 21:54:59 He’s a smooth talking snake oil salesman with a Messiah-complex and a bitter hatred for our country, our military, and our constitution.

4063 2018-09-08 21:54:17 Dog, shout out to @Valvoline. Been using the same oil change coupon for years like thanks, y'all, for being consistent

4067 2018-09-08 21:54:01 Use olive oil instead of mayonnaise as salad dressing to reduce your intake of bad fats and increase your intake of good fats.
4068 2018-09-08 21:54:01 This is exactly WHY I am anti MAYO in a cake. Just aid oil and eggs rather than preservative laden oil and eggs.  Mayo adds nothing to the mix in terms of flavor or texture. Butter, Sour Cream or Coconut milk OTH all add a recipes overall flavor and texture.
4069 2018-09-08 21:53:45 I'm all about annexing Venezuela. They have rich oil fields AND desperately need some freedom? Score!

4073 2018-09-08 21:53:03 Coup is the only answer and you know it. They have too much oil and the Russians and Chinese are more than happy to prop up Maduro to get some it.

4094 2018-09-08 21:50:55 You were rude to him that is why 
4095 2018-09-08 21:50:55 The president does not control gas prices. That’s a market too large for any one person to control, but we ARE now the largest oil producer in the world.
4096 2018-09-08 21:50:44 dear @Valvoline, thank your guys for telling me something was wrong with my car, suggesting i have it towed to my mechanic because there was no oil pressure, and not mentioning the unauthorised “repairs” (aka damages) they attempted. little stunt cost me $269. lost one customer!

4100 2018-09-08 21:50:15 My mom just informed me that she went to get her oil changed today and she was 10,000 miles over the 3000 mile recommendation for getting it changed... this is not a joke this is real life
4101 2018-09-08 21:50:14 I’ll be that but let me know when you try using the oil & you get hit harder than a whole brownie
4102 2018-09-08 21:49:42 You can add a splash of butter at the end to give a little taste of luxury. But shouldn't use it to cook with! Oil and butter is good but butter will still burn 
4103 2018-09-08 21:49:37 once @yeetztweetz tweeted about putting lemongrass and eucalyptus oil in his diffuser and now I can’t go back thank you
4104 2018-09-08 21:49:16 I think  silver and gold are in a good buy point now but oil is facing a major correction
4105 2018-09-08 21:49:16 I need some more castor oil for my scalp...like the big ass bottle cause I’m tired of rebuying this shit

4107 2018-09-08 21:49:14 Good luck! Haven’t used bio oil, is it helping? I’m not bothered by what it looks like, but it still hurts a bit if I catch the scar on something.

4112 2018-09-08 21:48:45 It boggles my mind. I admit to using sour cream or coconut milk in some of my cake recipes, but mayo is just whipped egg whites and oil with a tone of preservatives. WHY use that shit in your cakes rather then butter or oil itself?
4113 2018-09-08 21:48:43 @Walmart how long for  an oil change? Two hours n counting for a truck since it was pulled into the garage. Still waiting for mine n it's been 3 hours.

And Start with yourself cause Clinton supports All of the Above!
4116 2018-09-08 21:48:03 Yeah, I bio oil the scar a few times a day and I have an appointment with surgeon next week to discuss follow up and book surgery for the left hand
4117 2018-09-08 21:47:57 I just tried my first CBD oil. I don't smoke weed but have sudden urge to put on Jefferson Airplane LP and buy a VW van.

4118 2018-09-08 21:47:53 I honestly can’t imagine this made with bacon fat!  but I am definitely going to give it a go with coconut oil (mainly because I know I’ve got a big tub in the pantry) Thank you!!
4119 2018-09-08 21:47:18 The raw materials dt keeps the global north powerful is in the global south, essentially in Africa.

4134 2018-09-08 21:45:52 Okay, getting free samples from Elemis was dangerous - the products seem lovely - went to check out the prices of full size bottles, and all I can say is HOLY COW. I think I’m pushing the boat out when I pay full price for Oil of Olay...

4141 2018-09-08 21:45:14 20 garlic cloves + Thyme + cinnamon stick + red pepper flakes + olive oil= confit
4142 2018-09-08 21:44:59 Does that make me wife material? I went to culinary school, and cook. Or does that make me 'man material' because I know how to change a tire, change oil, pay bills, balance a checkbook (Yeah people use those still), and do basic math without a register? :D
4143 2018-09-08 21:44:41 Forgot to get my oil changed  I don’t feel like doing it myself

4149 2018-09-08 21:43:18 Lavender essential oil with water in a spray bottle helps all pests, you can try spraying down some areas of your porch/yard as a minor defense maybe until the plants are more grown?
4150 2018-09-08 21:43:07 The bill makes it expensive to bring that oil on shore, and process. A suggestion to @POTUS would be to bring the oil thru fed lands, then pipe it to processors in Nevada.

It meant he were strong enough to show his emotions and even after a hard battle, he didnt let himself grow cold. Working in the oil feilds is hard, so is being away from family.

Serving it with a pineapple-cilantro-jalaneno salsa & rice.

4169 2018-09-08 21:40:23 Facts? No, it's easier to believe everything Trumpy tells you instead of questioning anything or employing something know as critical thinking. That's how the snake oil salesman got votes in the first place.

4185 2018-09-08 21:37:55 The thing is Daniel. these issues are brought to you thanks to good old US of A in collusion with right wings elements and the 0.1% in Venezuela.

4192 2018-09-08 21:36:24 Did you know Chick-fil-A fries their stuff in peanut oil but it goes thru a refining process that removes the allergy protein that’s why we (peanut allergy people) can eat it

4194 2018-09-08 21:36:10 He inspired all of us and whats sad is there isn't anyone who could even remotely take his place or carry the torch. Marvel comics is now Corporate Comics. Just like Big Oil and Big Pharma and Big Tech we now have Big Comics.
4195 2018-09-08 21:36:10 I’ll actually be adding on my warnings thread which essential oils are poisonous for cats and dogs too. But yeah @astrobee is right fakes have some real oil in them and the rest is usually a carrier oil that have no smell to them. But cats are definitely more sensitive than dogs

4200 2018-09-08 21:35:33 Yes, we are in an era of disruption. The good news is there are plenty of renewable energy jobs required to replace oil worker jobs. The auto industry is next. Hang on for a bumpy ride. There is no turning back.

4217 2018-09-08 21:33:11 Pls RT! If palm oil regulator @RSPOtweets drops infamous #palmoil company @Indofood, @PepsiCo & @Nestle’s business partner, it’ll send a powerful message that Indofood must stop exploiting workers, or be forced out of the market.
4218 2018-09-08 21:32:55 I would think they would know better than to drop his name.  He even knows not to use it much
4219 2018-09-08 21:32:46 Pistol told me they have in Cali weed oil pods compatable with the juul.  They better come here when recreational is available.
4220 2018-09-08 21:32:33 I've used it (as have relatives) and it works pretty good for mild to moderate aches. I know there's a lot of subpar CBD oil sold in the states that don't have legal recreational, though. They also have infused teas here for nighttime pain relief.
4221 2018-09-08 21:32:33 Love it. The oil bar texture all loose and alive is great

4226 2018-09-08 21:31:40 In why we have not saved $$ from oil/gas and Norway has. We’ve converted what we could’ve saved from royalties etc. into lower taxes, as you pointed out. If we had a PST we might better see savings, esp from booms.
4227 2018-09-08 21:31:31 I'm surprised that I've never tweeted about Venezuela when I've tweeted about the Middle East and North Korea. Anyways, the only three words needed to know the Venezuela situation is: Maduro, oil, coup.
4228 2018-09-08 21:31:23 All of our local oil tankers are Small.  these massive oil ships Will end up causing a massive spill.  It will destroy the Gulf of Georgia.  We just got our Humpback Whales and wild Salmon back and healthy from past mistakes.  The world is moving toward Hydrogen anyhow. Wake Up.
4229 2018-09-08 21:31:22 Some of the best advertising I've seen lately is 25% off at an oil change place for Uber and Lyft drivers. 

Going after people who have to change their oil more frequently.
4230 2018-09-08 21:31:21 ....along side NEW drilling by oil and gas companies.
4231 2018-09-08 21:31:08 And just as this government doesn’t control the price of oil, the conservatives didn’t but they sure benefitted from the boom.
4232 2018-09-08 21:30:59 I heard a break down by an analyst this week discussing E15 and basically saying it's not going to change anything because there's no incentive to blend with RIN prices.  Also E15 is about to go back to the pump with summer ending.  So I think keeping big oil supporting Cruz wins

4237 2018-09-08 21:30:40 @ShadowTodd hope to have a One Hot Wonderland about Icehouse’s “Great Southern Land” to join the one you did on Midnight Oil. That song is beautiful
4238 2018-09-08 21:30:37 People pronounce jojoba oil [khokhoba] ..... Shookethhhh
4239 2018-09-08 21:30:35 When did big oil ask permission to pollute the earth and mess up our atmosphere ?

only thing they do is buy politicians.
4240 2018-09-08 21:30:23 What proof do you have of corruption in the Trump White House?  Back up your claims otherwise you’re nothing more than snake oil.

4242 2018-09-08 21:30:13 In 2040 Europe, Britain, America and most of Asia would end dependent on fossil fuel (oil). We need to start diversification drive today by building local businesses.@HMKemiAdeosun

4243 2018-09-08 21:30:11 The bad news is that I voted for Obama twice.  The good news is that I have a lifetime supply of snake oil.

4245 2018-09-08 21:29:59 Have you been to Newfoundland? Jobs are scarce. There’s a reason so many work in Fort Mac. Aging population, educated kids going elsewhere for work—the opposite of AB. A lot of tough lessons Alberta seems ready to ignore and repeat. 2-3% PST + save oil revenue, or end up like NL.
4246 2018-09-08 21:29:40 I know, that's what pissed me off at Bush 43, an oil man. Back when crude was $120 a barrel the price of gas when way up to $5/gal. Now crude is, what, $70 and price of gas is $2.90/gal. Total bs. Cost of borrowing $ is up too, maybe why car sales are down.
4247 2018-09-08 21:29:37 There is an equal amount of oil beneath the Indian continent, but we are not in a position to dig it out.
4248 2018-09-08 21:29:26 Yay, now to their leaking oil bullpen. 
4249 2018-09-08 21:29:04 Yes, we are supposed to be defending principles, not oil and opium poppies, so thanks for the reminder.
4250 2018-09-08 21:29:00 If you want an example, look at Rockefeller and standard oil. Because of the profit motive, Rockefeller made advancements dramatically slashing the cost of lighting and heating our homes, and got rich doing it. Free markets drive us to serve others to advance ourselves.
4251 2018-09-08 21:28:46 Yeah I see what you mean. Canola oil is probably not good either. But we dont have sustainable canola oil yet as far as I know. There is a sustainable palm oil certification. And rain Forrest alliance certified. Be sure to purchase palm oil products from those certifications! 
4252 2018-09-08 21:28:39 Probably cooking in high heat refined GE seed oil with BHA or BHT added brings out the worst in a potato ...do we need The Simplot GE potato or should we just give up Chips?

4264 2018-09-08 21:26:12 my dad got mad because i pointed out that his oil can leaked and therefore I bought a new one
4265 2018-09-08 21:26:07 I sure say as the fight happen one carry the oil wey the other one carry the rice boot
4266 2018-09-08 21:25:57 “It’s like everyone is digging in the same spot because one guy struck oil there”

This is how I feel about startups/makers/hustle/life

It feels like we’re all fighting for the same thing and it’s one never ending race to get there.

4275 2018-09-08 21:24:40 Or maybe ask some questions about why Venezuela is the only country that hasn't been allowed to nationalize its natural resources. Venezuelan gov is mismanaged, but this year's calamitous drop in oil production is all about assets lost to foreign court cases.
4276 2018-09-08 21:24:37 Please some one tell me why type of oil are they using in this seen

4280 2018-09-08 21:24:11 I'm talking about your apparent ignorance. While you're distracted by photo ops and sensationalized announcements, more oil was drilled for domestically under Obama than any other president. He even bragged about domestic production exceeding imported oil.
4281 2018-09-08 21:23:37 Trump admin considered overthrow of Venezuela govt - interesting that US wants to get involved when the foreign country has large oil reserves ... not so much when there is horrific genocide
4282 2018-09-08 21:23:15 Why saving so much reserves ? Do the BJP has to repay all the oil bond debts in one go ?
This way BJP will clean the place. People will not understand. Congress will come to power with clean sheets just like 2004 and take all the credit away.

4362 2018-09-08 21:09:47 so, in other words, this is a company rising money for their drilling complex through an ICO instead of an IPO??? $Petrodollar will be a stable coin backed by oil and gas that is not even available yet?? the only good thing ablut this project is the usage of xRapid, IF get there.
4363 2018-09-08 21:09:40 Fíjate los surtidores de Oil, nos deben 8 mil millones de pesos (hoy ya son más)
4364 2018-09-08 21:09:25 Wait till you check the olive oil liter/month/person ratio in a Syrian house
4365 2018-09-08 21:09:22 There's blame on both sides. However it was wrong for Transmountain to double the number of oil storage tanks around 10000s of people in the 21st century. The fact that Burnaby is now allowed to challenge government approval is big
4366 2018-09-08 21:09:11 Please I can't cook oil rice 
4367 2018-09-08 21:08:42 @UberScoot do I oil the rear shock absorber to stop the squeaking when I sit??

4370 2018-09-08 21:07:49 Yo, so can we as a species stop overusing palm oil products, please?
4371 2018-09-08 21:07:45 #DamsForPakistan if all profit making public and armed forces  corporate entities ( fertilizers, sugar mills, schools, cement plants, banks, cereals, oil/gas etc etc owned by military services) can direct 50% of their profits towards #DamsForPakistan until their completion....
4372 2018-09-08 21:07:08 Sus. Was this not considered by the econ managers? Bakit ipinilit pa rin ang excise tax on  oil knowing the volatile world market prices plus our weak currency.  Smoking is also an addiction.  It’s so easy to just stop smoking ‘no?
4373 2018-09-08 21:07:07 Anti-aging hand treatment - soak your hands in milk for 15 mins. Rinse then apply a bit of olive oil on them.
4374 2018-09-08 21:07:02 Careful... it's a slippery slope! (well, it IS covered in Olive oil!) 
4375 2018-09-08 21:07:02 Plains All American Pipeline oil Wilders says no more California cartoons, for now
4376 2018-09-08 21:06:52 Sanity and American politics??? Now that's a statement for idiots by a lying terrorist, which turned Libya from the most prosperous country in Africa to a desperate lawless country.. But wait the oil is safe and free flowing!!!!
4377 2018-09-08 21:06:50 I want a vit c and a night hylaronic and this one comes recommended from a guru tho am concerned about price which is same as yours. But your brand is stocked at Cult Beauty so will look at it when my skin needs oil come winter and can $
4378 2018-09-08 21:06:49 i need sum CBD oil
4379 2018-09-08 21:06:32 So you are one of those who believes in conspiracy theories instead of truth. You guys scare me to death, because the uneducated of the country will believe you. You are no better than a snake oil salesman.
4380 2018-09-08 21:06:32 I really don't know why everyone is freaked out about this. I watched my aunt make homemade mayonnaise and it's basically just eggs and oil so it makes sense that you could substitute it in a cake. Why the hate ?  
4381 2018-09-08 21:05:59 Snake Oil Nitro Stout by Milwaukee Brewing Company found at The Milwaukee Ale House. Can't Beat It.
4382 2018-09-08 21:05:50 do you think its weird that I think it's kind of sexy that she smells of motor oil? mmMMm snow bunny. like 5w30 haha
4383 2018-09-08 21:05:46 Exactly. If five of these guys become NHL regulars, the Oil did very well.
4384 2018-09-08 21:05:41 I don’t think it’s quite in the same category. But, sure, you can stop using oil and oil byproducts today. That is your choice!

And I encourage anyone against the oil sands to take that step as an example to the rest of us, before demanding the rest of us to follow suit.
4385 2018-09-08 21:05:39 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other.
4386 2018-09-08 21:05:02 Mum's trying to make fat by toasting  bread soaked in oil fgs
4387 2018-09-08 21:04:59 I'm outraged!! Police pulled me over and called me Sir. Excuse me? I didn't study olive oil for 8 years to not be called Baron... A little respect please? Besides did they just assume my gender? Now I know how feminist Drs of philosophy feel when they miss her title. Go sister!
4388 2018-09-08 21:04:40 @ArtRage on PC. Starting to work larger, 5k+ pixels a side. Can you throw me a higher res group of oil brushes? Like the default ones, just bigger?
4389 2018-09-08 21:04:36 I loathe when I hear people say “AMERICA IS FIGHTING FOR FREEDOM!”

America is the country that’s oppressing all the other nations. 

America is the country invading and bombing the Middle East for oil & land and killing hundreds of millions of people. 

Open your ignorant eyes.
4390 2018-09-08 21:04:35 I guess the problem for the US is the horrific debt it carries. I understand that your GDP is rising, possibly even too fast but the country being "owned" by various Oil States, the Chinese and Russians is perhaps troublesome. Wage alignment with competitors therefore needed?
4391 2018-09-08 21:04:30 on similar terms, all profit making public and armed forces  corporate entities ( fertilizers, sugar mills, schools, cement plants, banks, cereals, oil/gas etc etc owned by military services)can direct 50% of their profits towards #DamsForPakistan until their completion....
4392 2018-09-08 21:04:20 Hi Natasha, I'm sorry about your grease proof paper! I hope this didn't ruin pizza night! This may sound very silly but did you grease the paper with margarine or oil? 1/2
4393 2018-09-08 21:04:14 1) we don't care for our own (poor or Vets) because we don't want to - something about bootstraps and not wanting to pay taxes. We have plenty of money, we'd just prefer to give wealthy people tax breaks and subsidize big oil.

It's not an either or kind of situation.

4406 2018-09-08 21:02:25 I'm sure somebody must have updated the Mikado to include Internet marketers, and if not they should have done. Something lingering with boiling oil in it, indeed.
4407 2018-09-08 21:02:25 Swiping through Bumble while someone changes the oil in my Mini Cooper is my brand
4408 2018-09-08 21:02:22 Your take on snake oil salesmen Morrison says more about you than him. I do agree "don't underestimate him. He's as cunning as a rat.
4409 2018-09-08 21:02:16 Politics. Elections around the corner. Trade Wars rubbing off on emerging markets currencies. Probable oil price drop due to seasonal changes, et al.

4411 2018-09-08 21:01:51 My first ever trip through there I said that. Stopped at an A&W and thought it felt quite nostalgic. It was , it hadn't been updated since it was built. Still had that real fat oil smell
4412 2018-09-08 21:01:30 InshaAllah some of the wealthy Muslims of the Oil rich Arab states can make up this amount.  I never did. Understand why Muslims make themselves dependant on non-Muslim states.
4413 2018-09-08 21:01:26 @mmtcfl Q? R U aware of research &/or treatment w/ CBD Oil or w/ full THC content 4 Ringing-in-the-Ears (Tinnitus)? I tried CBD Oil for about 5 weeks & the only benefit was falling asleep quicker at night. It doesn't matter the dosage, ie 100mg or 300mg. Thanks 4 Ur reply
4414 2018-09-08 21:01:26 All this kid does is apologize for everything he never did, and give billions of our dollars away to big oil. Pfft.
4415 2018-09-08 21:01:25 The government of France has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of George Stephanopoulos in a chenille wig.
4416 2018-09-08 21:01:18 All you have to do is admit there is suppressed tech that could end the use of oil in a matter of 1 year. BTW its not a fossil fuel.  If it were then how did the abandoned oil fields of Texas refill themselves. Discovered during the BP Oil spill.
4417 2018-09-08 21:01:12 my oil change is taking so long i’ve been here for 1.5 hours and my phone is dying. i just want food and vietnamese iced coffee _(」∠ ､ﾝ､)_

4425 2018-09-08 21:00:09 Sir the whole ruckus is cause of the sanctions put up by the U.S. on Iran. And Iran is the chief supplier of oil to India.

4428 2018-09-08 20:59:35 Hi you should do everything you can to get to Europe, the US, Canada or Australia. With your masters alone you will be a superstar for any oil & gas company and or government petroleum, petrochemicals and or construction regulatory body.
4429 2018-09-08 20:59:33 And Patra ji came to know about this only after fuel price loot. These are the same thugs who were taking credit of low crude oil prices and then lower petrol prices.. as per them at that time no such debt bond were there 
4430 2018-09-08 20:59:29 It's very short-sighted. No point being rich from oil/coal/diesel car money if you also died when you were flooded/the earth burned.......
4431 2018-09-08 20:59:07 @W_K_Restoration I love your work on the repair shop. Amazing stuff. Could I ask. How would you finish a ring slabie cut of a trunk, coffee table?  Oil, varnish, wax?  I am very confused and was hoping they you may be able to help 
4432 2018-09-08 20:58:28 Wow.  What a nutter.  Syria isn't oil rich for a start.  Just lol.

4437 2018-09-08 20:57:35 Yesterday the barrel price of crude oil (7.9.) in market was traded 89.90$.
4438 2018-09-08 20:57:19 I use a variety of things depending on mood/energy - I love essential oil but also use a natural pillow spray too! Love things like this 
4439 2018-09-08 20:57:13 prepared in Cold Press Coconut oil, turmeric, cayenne, black pepper, ginger, garlic, red onions, Nigella seeds.. all stir fried with my veggies, a cup size on my plate, a rare palm size of my hand steak, 2 to 3 slices of bacon and half of a good size avocado
4440 2018-09-08 20:57:13 Nope that’s it. An oil and filter change is £180, go prorata with air filter, fuel filter and pollen filter and it doubles. Extra for air con gas, brake fluid change etc etc.
4441 2018-09-08 20:57:10 And we haven't even mentioned the bursting of oil pipelines, the Oil tankers crashing, the BP Oil spill and other major environmental disasters that we endure just for the inertia of wanting to use a gas car. Gas cars are just objectively worse.
4442 2018-09-08 20:56:57 If that is what is generally done I see nothing wrong with it...if u add an element to accentuate something and make it more appealing why would that not be done? Kapo are u saying that is not done to other skin tones? Oil is mostly used for darker skin tones?
4443 2018-09-08 20:56:54 Venezuelan  people is inviting a military action.  This is the only way to get rid of the Narco regime. We rather the United States of America than the Cuba regime.  Cuba gets our oil for free and they are the ones governing Venezuela.
4444 2018-09-08 20:56:47 We know sir. They're rent-seekers driven solely by selfish desires. We're aware of their conspiracies. Their noises aren't distracting us. Their letters are thrashed since they had been there before. We will not renew their oil block licences the stole by their positions.
4445 2018-09-08 20:56:36 He’s a complete joke and fancies himself as the next Obama but he isn’t nearly as smooth. People are getting wise to the game of these snake oil salesmen.
4446 2018-09-08 20:56:26 Hello, we're sorry for your experience! Sometimes oil separates to the top of the jar due to temperature variances before or after purchase. Give it a stir and you should be good to go! Thanks for reaching out!
4447 2018-09-08 20:56:17 That's true, Sir. But why did it started? hugo chavez started frenzy public spending riding the high oil prices back then. He thought of himself as another Bolivar. Tried to persuade other latins & declared almost war against US. Maduro continues to maintain same.

4450 2018-09-08 20:55:56 Been thinking a lot bout how crazy oil is, like she just does  not  fuck  with water

4452 2018-09-08 20:55:41 Getting my oil changed at a dealership. Got a text saying if I need anything, reply to the text.

Sir, that’s not what we meant.

4457 2018-09-08 20:55:20 Back in the day, Alex Jones would’ve just shown up in town with a cart, from which he’d sell snake oil & teach phrenology, give speeches on why you shouldn’t trust carpetbaggers or Italians, and eventually get run back out of town when his “love potion” made all the men go bald.
4458 2018-09-08 20:55:19 I swear I think he actually thinks of himself as some kind of a god or I don't know, someone who is beyond special! I will take Trump over this snake oil salesman any day of the week and twice on Sunday!
4459 2018-09-08 20:55:14 Sorry John, but the dressing of Lobster Salad is Terrible!!! Just Fresh Italian sliced tomato raw onion and extravergine Oil! No more!!! Please, change restaurant!!!!

4461 2018-09-08 20:54:33 .... what if... it comes with a side of, *He pulls out another cutely packed container* fried veggies, I was very light on the oil. I know you’d like that *he had fun.. pestering her a bit, it’s the only time he gets to really spend with her so.. it’s become a bit of a habit*
4462 2018-09-08 20:54:33 I don’t wanna oil no booties though. I’d have to see if she needs a thigh man
4463 2018-09-08 20:54:24 Yikes, #palmoil regulator @RSPOtweets is greenwashing @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s business partner @Indofood. RT to tell the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil to punish Indofood for dealing in exploitation palm oil!
4464 2018-09-08 20:54:12 Is this not the same forward and backward movement that brings liquid (crude oil) out of the earth? Nigerians needs it...please don't ask me which one I'm referring to.
4465 2018-09-08 20:54:02 Infrastructure needs lots of welders, and every other trade. We have hundreds of billions in infrastructure deficit. Enough for decades of work. No oil production expansion required.
4466 2018-09-08 20:54:02 Yay, because sharing your photo of food that beautifully beguiling without including the recipe - that was just mean.
We cook w/o oil but I see no problems omitting it from this, or with finding any of its ingredients. It sure looks delicious! Thank you for sharing it! 
4467 2018-09-08 20:54:00 The only reason I did is because I live in Alberta. We needed a pro oil leader.
4468 2018-09-08 20:53:49 Really wanted to make brownies tonight but I ain’t got no oil > fuck
4469 2018-09-08 20:53:42 Some of y'all out there used to melt when you heard Obama speak. That fool always sounded like a snake oil salesman to me. I saw straight through that brotha and took heat for talking about him. He's a joke.

4472 2018-09-08 20:53:26 The US has specifically said it will secure oil by whatever means necessary as part of its global doctrine. Do you really not know these things? Maybe read a little Noam Chomsky, or do you still think you're a man of the world reading the Times?
4473 2018-09-08 20:53:15 Peanuts Are One of the Ingredients in Dynamite. Peanut oil can be processed to produce glycerol, which can be used to make nitroglycerine, an explosive liquid used in dynamite.
4474 2018-09-08 20:53:05 He is a disgrace and a snake oil salesman no panache just pure evil
4475 2018-09-08 20:52:46 Guys @SwampHead Midnight oil is the bomb. One of the better coffee stouts I’ve had.
4476 2018-09-08 20:52:45 Oil ?
4477 2018-09-08 20:52:38 but hey , at least they arent selling oil that isnt in dollars - kerching.
4478 2018-09-08 20:52:35 You want to drink groundnut oil this night.
4479 2018-09-08 20:52:30 "Plenty good money to be made/supplying the army with tools of the trade". Of course they don't. I do though, and so do many people who understand that these conflicts have nothing to do with us. I suppose it is about oil in the end.
4480 2018-09-08 20:52:29 Oil & water
4481 2018-09-08 20:52:19 a friend's dermatologist just got her accutane because it's the winter but! also that's a body-by-body treatment ofc, i usually cut down on non-food-based treatments (coconut oil, turmeric, rosewater, sugar) when my skin acts up if that helps at all? regardless, yer a cutie!
4482 2018-09-08 20:52:12 Thanks for all you do!  obammy is an Enemy of the State!  Like so many posts years ago said, "Once you realize he is an enemy of the United States, his actions make total sense."  Snake Oil Salesman Extraordinaire!
4483 2018-09-08 20:51:41 It strongly depends on US oil production. If US production  continues growing, the dollar will strengthen and curb worldwide demand and prices. In my scenario however, US production will slow down significantly leading to a weaker dollar and higher oil prices.
4484 2018-09-08 20:51:15 It is basically impossible to find basic things without palm oil in them, its ridiculous.
4485 2018-09-08 20:51:15 Obama is a lying snake oil salesman. He did nothing but create division. Now he’s up to his same old rhetoric.
4486 2018-09-08 20:51:08 This oil technician is patronizing me and Gigi and i don’t like it
4487 2018-09-08 20:51:02 .
Btw, Libya is still being bombed by US-backed oil and wealth hunters in UAE!
You still can apply for a job there if you have any military background.
4488 2018-09-08 20:50:46 I used to work out of an office up there in oil sector. It does suck the life out of you . Thankfully I could leave at any time. Got more speeding tickets leaving Edmonton than anywhere else in NA. Except maybe Montreal
4489 2018-09-08 20:50:31 It will be wwlll also a qt of oil is 12.00 for the cheap stuff! #TARRIFS this just may send our economy the direction they actually want it too! #Venezuela

4492 2018-09-08 20:49:57 Canada became an enemy for various reasons, mostly gas&oil, pro immigrants stance, and for genuinely being more popular than the Trump clan. 
Also, Ivanka is still broken hearted . 
And Djadja wants his part of Canadia , too.
4493 2018-09-08 20:49:56 I need it for that, too. More than the insomnia even. MCT oil works well for that, too.

Oil on cut-and-pasted
4495 2018-09-08 20:49:36 Plastic. It comes from oil. 
4496 2018-09-08 20:49:29 Nah I disagree dark skin is beautiful..iv never subcribed to the notion that it not..all I'm saying All skin pops and looks better under oil...that's just what oil does
4497 2018-09-08 20:49:10 お、いる…ッッ(パタリ
4498 2018-09-08 20:49:09 After Zarika's win, every Kenyan should be placing multiple bets on @SportPesa atleast we can sleep a happy lot. Where as others are hiking oil prices and yet Wanjiku is still in tears
4499 2018-09-08 20:49:09 S/o to the tea tree oil for saving my scalp
4500 2018-09-08 20:49:04 As I said there are plenty of jobs in the transition to cleaner energy. There is a lot of low carbon work that needs to be done that doesn't because we don't value it like we value oil. Those are political decisions.
4501 2018-09-08 20:49:03 FYI mining also includes oil and gas sectors. That's one thing I got to hand to trump he really pegged y'all right as being uneducated.
4502 2018-09-08 20:48:57 I’m not dreaming that global climate change is real. We won’t eliminate oil anytime soon and I support the pipeline. In a changing world, workers need to adapt. Retrain. Tearing down the legal system the PC’s appointed not a safe or recommended option.
4503 2018-09-08 20:48:33 If you’re tested because someone sees you as a threat. It doesn’t matter, he is the owner of Tesla, if he can partake/microdose on ONE hit, then this woman can treat any illness she has with CBD oil that’s prescribed through MMJ. This stereo type of the laZy stoner needs to die
4504 2018-09-08 20:48:25 When did he say that?

CAN WE JUST TALK ABOUT WHEN HE CALLED LORI OLIVE OIL...
4505 2018-09-08 20:48:23 And palm/coconut oil in everything. SOMEONE THINK OF THE ORANGUTANS, FFS.
4506 2018-09-08 20:48:22 They get loans and produced energy by most expensive source as oil,that was just time pass policy.
No leadership , no vision
4507 2018-09-08 20:47:40 LOL....
Let the Wheat and the Tares grow together...
How do we know who does or doesn't have the annointing...
Unless we go back to the ORIGINAL BIBLICAL PHYSICAL practice of LITTERALLY pouring oil on people?
P.s. Annoint is only part of the deal... SAUL was annointed. lol ;)
4508 2018-09-08 20:47:39 I had some the bluegrass hemp oil and it did wonders for my joints!
4509 2018-09-08 20:47:35 Mustard oil?
4510 2018-09-08 20:47:25 Next time, add 1 tablespoon of mineral oil to about 1 cup of chocolate pudding. Mix it until the consistancy looks like normal pudding again. 
There isn’t the even the tiniest hint of the oil taste and it works like a charm. 
We call it “poo pudding”.
4511 2018-09-08 20:47:19 Completed and passed my Osha 10 training for the oil business:)
4512 2018-09-08 20:47:18 The glass ceiling of a bank?  an oil company?  a weapons manufacturer?  the glass ceiling at CNN?  MSDNC? NYT?  WaPo?
4513 2018-09-08 20:47:16 Since I’m in the oil industry I’m definitely getting my neck tatted
4514 2018-09-08 20:47:15 Allyuh doh start with we oil down. It's two different dishes lol.
4515 2018-09-08 20:47:13 Even if u add the interest the debt through oil bonds benefitted common man like me much more than a bullet train !
4516 2018-09-08 20:46:57 @ALT_uscis  For constipation, add 1 tablespoon of mineral oil to about 1 cup of chocolate pudding. Mix it until the consistancy looks like normal pudding again. 

There isn’t the even the tiniest hint of the oil taste and it works like a charm. 
We call it “poo pudding”.

4518 2018-09-08 20:46:49 I have the support of the vast majority of my scientist peers. I support Portugal's model, not a "legalization" model that psychiatrists do not want and I ask for clinical trials 3 that MDs want.

You, are the ones without science backing your snake oil cannabis business.
4519 2018-09-08 20:46:36 He knows that those headphones hanging around his neck is a product of oil, right?
4520 2018-09-08 20:46:27 Have you tried rosewater as a gentle cleanser? My skin was irritated this week but using it to limit the oil seemed to help? You still look great regardless Mon bb
4521 2018-09-08 20:46:18 Rubio told Trump coup equals we get to keep the oil
Trump right we should have done in Iraq.
4522 2018-09-08 20:46:17 Might start infusing CBD oil in @HoneydippedCos products. (European Hemp Extract) this can help with anxiety and pain management. 

Y’all feeling it?
4523 2018-09-08 20:46:06 Any of you criticism the ideas of marijuana proposed by mr @Yelesowore2019 you need to wake up most things we import into Nigeria is make from marijuana when refined , when do you start thinking of generating more income into Nigeria apart from oil
4524 2018-09-08 20:45:58 Coconut oil is actually v good for dogs!!
4525 2018-09-08 20:45:31 4. The problem is unfair enforcement of these rules, hundreds of Hamas and Antifa pages promoting violence stay. 

5. Standard Oil Company did, until we stopped them. Do you remember the early 20th century?
4526 2018-09-08 20:45:21 Spice up your sex life with a massage oil!
4527 2018-09-08 20:45:12 I’ll bring the oil 
4528 2018-09-08 20:45:04 This paid monthly shit is no fun sitting in on a Saturday night with a cheap bottle of wine covered in coconut oil 
4529 2018-09-08 20:45:03 Is it possible to get high off of diffused eucalyptus oil asking for a friend
4530 2018-09-08 20:45:01 I found the cure for hangovers and it’s $40 worth of chic fil a and listening to High Horse by Kacey Musgraves as loud as possible.
4531 2018-09-08 20:45:00 Peanut is ideal, but cheap vegetable oil works just fine for me
4532 2018-09-08 20:45:00 @avril_gotti
4533 2018-09-08 20:44:55 Does Trump use the Google and read the Wikipedia?

[Trump identified Papadopoulos as one of his campaign's foreign policy advisers on March 21, 2016, in an interview with the editorial board of The Washington Post. Trump said: "He’s an energy and oil consultant, excellent guy".]
4534 2018-09-08 20:44:26 Where is my olive oil oooo
Need to drink it bfo I sleep
4535 2018-09-08 20:44:19 Bhatti g us waqt ya baji ka leya oil lana or kuch lana gaya howa tha
4536 2018-09-08 20:44:15 Omg.. This movie is so good but so sad @ the same time bc the portrayal of the big Oil companies is so freaking true.. “They don’t care about people’s lives that work for them, they just care about the Almighty Dollar”- Mike Williams (Mark Whalberg) — watching Deepwater Horizon
4537 2018-09-08 20:44:09 No worries!  300 meter oil tankers full of Ka-millions of barrels of poison Bitumen crud exploding onto our ocean shores----- not a problem.   The mess will go away.  --- some day. 
The whales Will return in a couple of thousand years.  
Whats the fuss?
4538 2018-09-08 20:43:58 Agendas like? 
So when the US and other countries come occupy Iraq, steal our oil to this day, give us a fucked up government while killing millions but wait no they didnt do this for an agenda they were eliminating a nuclear threat. (1/2)
4539 2018-09-08 20:43:53 I’ll never believe any president’s COS will doop an ordinary civilian 29m Naira. Haba Engr. These people are dealing with International oil organizations, foreign investors, telecommunications industries and Import/Export Nigerian business men. 

Sai wani gara za cuta 29m Naira??
4540 2018-09-08 20:43:48 sometimes you gotta empty the friers and change the oil, takes a while to heat it back up to cooking temp
4541 2018-09-08 20:43:29 If the High & Mighty in Nigeria especially in the #Oil&Gas Sector continue to push workers to the wall. They are risking a revolution in Nigeria! #LabourLens @Sharon
4542 2018-09-08 20:43:24 Just another edmontonian throwing themselves into oncoming traffic. Lol. It's tough when the Oil Kings are the best team in town. Best thing come no out of Edmonton is hwy 2 south. Blah blah blah, I've got lots more
4543 2018-09-08 20:43:24 Ei oil and rice is doing well than oil and gas. What a time!!!
4544 2018-09-08 20:43:14 Equally stupid spoiled rich kid,, Cheney’s puppet, tons of nepotism, banckrupted the country, started fake wars his oil cronies & family made BILLIONS OFF OF. News blackouts so we couldn’t see the caskets come home. But yeah without jr we would never have this moron.
4545 2018-09-08 20:43:10 But a certain Samaritan, as he
journeyed, came where he was. And when he saw him, he had compassion. So he
went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine; and he set him on
his own animal, brought him to an inn, and took care of him.
4546 2018-09-08 20:43:04 I have coconut oil in my hair and now I feel invincible
4547 2018-09-08 20:42:54 Paid for by oil and gas extraction on public land. You are a two bit criminal, nothing more.
4548 2018-09-08 20:42:47 Obama is a slick snake oil salesman.  He is selling Globalism & you don't even know it.  So you are are grouping military retirees, business owners, Law Enforcement, healthcare workers, medical personnel, and teaches in with the poor uneducated illegals?  Your posting is ignorant
4549 2018-09-08 20:42:38 You clearly have never tangled with us @realDonaldTrump .  Lock and load,  DJT.  Shit's about to get real if our energy and oil supplies stop heading your way.
4550 2018-09-08 20:42:35 Deffo baby oil but only a very small amount or it will attract dust.
4551 2018-09-08 20:42:28 What is the best oil?  Peanut or canola
4552 2018-09-08 20:42:25 why have the word "lube" in there if you aren't going to change by damned oil?
4553 2018-09-08 20:42:25 I kno next to nothing about Ariana Grande, don’t listen to her music, etc. but this is so upsetting and so wrong.
4554 2018-09-08 20:42:21 Tonight-olive oil,beef meat balls,garlic,basil,red wine,onion,chopped tomatoes. Brown pasta, touch of parmesan. Took half hour 
4555 2018-09-08 20:41:59 @ShannonBeador I have a simple question. Please let me know. You once told your daughter to bring garlic oil for an ear ache. Are they drops and does it work. I will have my husband get it for me right now.
4556 2018-09-08 20:41:37 Told my dad to take my car to get an oil change ONLY and now I have a $400 bill waiting for me !! *Cry’s in poor* I don’t want a car anymore Lmaoo
4557 2018-09-08 20:41:29 Also I have the charlottes web pills and they suck, the oil is the only way to go
4558 2018-09-08 20:41:20 Not all wishes come true. One has to try hard and burn the mid night oil my dear. Easier said than done.
4559 2018-09-08 20:41:14 I gotta AGREE-HelloFresh is GREAT! I recently started & I think this Company has all the Bugs worked out-EVERYTHING U NEED IS IN THE BOX except Salt,Pepper,Oil,Butter,& Sugar-that I Supply-Special spices,Herbed Oils & Infused or Balsamic Vinegars are supplied in tiny bottles byHF
4560 2018-09-08 20:40:52 How many genders Liz?
4561 2018-09-08 20:40:51 The fact they didn’t even have hair oil between the four of them and I had to provide my own already had me labelling them as clowns 
4562 2018-09-08 20:40:39 Preach. I mean heck, my car doesn’t leak oil, it’s sweating power 
4563 2018-09-08 20:40:28 ヴィルヘルムとあの眼鏡のにーさんとまた飲みたいなー
4564 2018-09-08 20:40:26 Cardi & Nicki just need to wrestle in oil, Blue from old school style
4565 2018-09-08 20:40:20 Highly recommend refrigerating wet wash cloths and adding some eucalyptus oil to cool off after a workout. 

So comfy and refreshing.
4566 2018-09-08 20:40:20 10 minutes later… New headline: “renewable energy source disappears; oil companies bought the technology and expertise, so they can bury it.“
4567 2018-09-08 20:40:14 Yes because morocco is middle east... Just stick with selling your oil, ya al saud
4568 2018-09-08 20:40:12 Can't even imagine how many species are gone if our ways don't change. Starting with deforestation and Oil.
4569 2018-09-08 20:40:10 I'm trying to be healthier & curbed having takeaways this weekend (it can be done,doesn't have to take ages)  Last night,1 tray,all chucked in,cubed chicken,fresh basil,peppers,mushrooms,onion,garlic,chilli,lemon, red wine,s&p,chorizo,olive oil. Bloody lovely
4570 2018-09-08 20:40:07 Oil would fly
4571 2018-09-08 20:40:07 今日午後からゲリラサラダ油来るらしいよ。
4572 2018-09-08 20:40:06 But why should they? No problem if they do,  but it shouldn't be demanded. Rural petrol stations in particular are already struggling to make much profit. Not everyone in the oil chain is super-wealthy.
4573 2018-09-08 20:39:58 The video is way too long and bores you to death. Basically... Get your snake oil here.
4574 2018-09-08 20:39:57 Im a whole 2 months past due on my oil change & i’m sure these guys r judging 
4575 2018-09-08 20:39:48 My grandparents gave me chiple, they said it’s to hot for me to change my oil so they took my car for a wash and oil change 
4576 2018-09-08 20:39:38 SPANISH TRAVEL POSTER ISSUED BY SHELL LUBRICATING OIL
Kseniia Boguslavskaia, David Bates
Illustrated book with offset lithograph
4577 2018-09-08 20:39:26 Oh yea!  HUMAN ANIMALS—learned how to make all sorts of things!  Now atomic bombs - oil spills and plastics polluting our oceans - killing off other wildlife because they can - atmosphere so polluted causing climate change!  Oh yea!  So smart they’re DUMB!!!
4578 2018-09-08 20:39:21 Putting coconut oil into the pymgy's hair.

"Hmm..."

"This should work."
4579 2018-09-08 20:39:20 That would be the best thing to happen in the lone star state since oil was discovered there.
4580 2018-09-08 20:38:46 What do they get free?   Facts matter.   Trump and facts are like oil and water.
4581 2018-09-08 20:38:38 Went from a $49 oil change to $450 in total maintenance
4582 2018-09-08 20:38:30 Pls RT! If palm oil regulator @RSPOtweets drops infamous #palmoil company @Indofood, @PepsiCo & @Nestle’s business partner, it’ll send a powerful message that Indofood must stop exploiting workers, or be forced out of the market.
4583 2018-09-08 20:38:22 Old Italian way to cook wings is on a charcoal grill.  You marinate them with some oil, vinegar, onions and some Italian parsley.  You won’t believe how good they taste
4584 2018-09-08 20:38:16 You should first ask how did they get to such starvation and economic disaster and maybe consider all the US sanctions and CIA-inflitrated operations there, because any smart person knows the US is only after their oil and will fight any president/regime who opposes that.
4585 2018-09-08 20:38:10 The decomposition point of Olive Oil is 220 degrees Celsius
4586 2018-09-08 20:38:09 @Shezad_ind agreed that fuel price was in the range of 80 during 2013, many from opposition and common people protested against it at that time, unlike you who refuse to do so now by making some absurd comparison's, do you want me to explain u the oil price back then & now?
4587 2018-09-08 20:38:08 Check @GarShehu reply,I'm really disappointed in this hoax of a thread he made,full of theories not enough for every right thinking individual to believe or substantiate and counter the allegations leveled against the 'COS
4588 2018-09-08 20:38:05 Call it a placebo or whatever but I swear this lavender oil has kept me so calm
4589 2018-09-08 20:38:03 Soybean oil, what else - its clear. But what is that strange looking yellow thing? Corn?
4590 2018-09-08 20:38:00 “manage”... those two might be bbfs but yo they clash like water and oil sometimes i can’t handle that
4591 2018-09-08 20:37:56 I propose the Windyday Concept.   All communities build battery and solar PT factories, and train youth for the jobs they will need.  Only way to get off oil and coal.
4592 2018-09-08 20:37:36 Shauns cost him £5k insurance and it eats his fuel and oil 
4593 2018-09-08 20:37:21 Spray peppermint oil there!  Or put tinfoil down.
4594 2018-09-08 20:37:16 I would say more responsibility regarding clean water & air. More specifically, preventing disasters like Flynn water crisis, oil spills, and gas leak in Aliso Cyn, CA.
4595 2018-09-08 20:36:57 Well your not going to have any food when Americans realize working in the fields and picking their own fruit ain’t so easy. And what’s so bad about using an alternative source of energy. Solar and electric cars keep us away from being dependent on the Middle East for oil.
4596 2018-09-08 20:36:50 Wouldn't the worst Spider-Man walk on the ground and throw oil at people? (clearly oil slicks are the opposite of sticky webbing)
4597 2018-09-08 20:36:30 Alberta will move oil faster if they send it straight south to the US  IDAHO North Dakota and then west over to Spokane and Seattle.
4598 2018-09-08 20:36:28 weed stopped helping w/ my regular pain kind of recently :\ like it might help w/ tooth pain but idk, could actually buy a little rn

i got some clove oil at the store but i'm also feeling fucked up from all the advil and tylenol and shit i've been taking for the past few days
4599 2018-09-08 20:36:12 Trading Post Southwest is selling Native and CBD oil
4600 2018-09-08 20:36:01 Saturday: Chocolate Cheesecake, Pinenut Olive Oil, Salty Vanilla Pretzel, Hong Kong Coffee, ND Maple Burnt Sugar & MORE
4601 2018-09-08 20:35:54 I’m sorry so many in Hope are affected. But abandoning the legal process isn’t an option. Relying on oil and gas for employment in the long term will lead to similar results. Perhaps they were there to offer Hope hope that other industries are lucrative too.
4602 2018-09-08 20:35:46 Obsession: "Psychic disturbance that produces a fixed and constant idea." In Colombia, social leaders are exterminated. Those displaced from the war cross the Mediterranean Sea. But, Venezuela with the world's first oil reserve are the obsession of Steve Hanke. @UN @nytimes
4603 2018-09-08 20:35:28 Recessions are not inherent and that is an excuse.  When Trump tried to spur jobs at 4.1% unemployment, that was inflationary. When he went to tariffs, he went for cost based inflation.  When he went for Iran, inflation on oil costs. We were not inherently headed to recession.
4604 2018-09-08 20:35:25 All of us get Touch light phone o 

Madam Alakija oil bloc sef use touch light phone before God pick up 
You are still a CEO plis dear
4605 2018-09-08 20:35:24 @JasonGregor @NationRealLife @jsbmbaggedmilk @Jason_Strudwick can someone tell me why the oil don’t look at Kassian higher on the depth chart. Speed, physical, good shot. Just curious.
4606 2018-09-08 20:35:19 Try CBD oil or just regular weed to chill you out bro.
4607 2018-09-08 20:35:16 Weed oil
4608 2018-09-08 20:35:13 Texas Olive Oil. Now that’s a good band name. 
4609 2018-09-08 20:35:10 Step 1:  baby oil on gloves !!!
Step 2: ? 
Step 3:  profit.
4610 2018-09-08 20:34:31 yes, the signal / noise issue has profound effects. There are genuine efforts to create an Internet and econ not controlled by giant monopoly platforms, and there are snake oil salesman getting a quick buck. the latter undermining the former needs calling out
4611 2018-09-08 20:34:30 You can cure monkeypox by rubbing coconut oil on it. #Pioppi #monkeypox
4612 2018-09-08 20:34:24 They love Vaginal Regulation... more than they love oil wealth and corruption.
4613 2018-09-08 20:34:22 Motor oil
4614 2018-09-08 20:34:15 nah mum i don’t smell anything?? maybe its that hemp oil shampoo you bought 
4615 2018-09-08 20:33:56 Heat up oil in a large frying pan (with Onions and Garlic) and add rice.  Cook until it's golden, mixing occasionally.  Add Tomato Sauce, water, and Bullion (along with Cumin and Pepper).  Heat to boiling then cover and let simmer for 30-40 minutes, stirring occasionally.
4616 2018-09-08 20:33:45 Amazing to me so many people will buy snake oil. Weird eh?
4617 2018-09-08 20:33:25 Does anyone have any good salad dressing recipes? I’m trying to stay away from all the cream and I’m not a fan of oil. Please and thank you.
4618 2018-09-08 20:33:12 Your consulate is on fire in Iraq. Trade some of that oil for water with China and put it out.
4619 2018-09-08 20:33:08 LOL, even while that is untrue, it's not his oil to give, it belongs to the Syrian people. You sound like a zionist "britian gave us palestine", Are you sure you arent really just a zionist troll?
4620 2018-09-08 20:32:59 Having Jacobs cream crackers soaked in egg and milk with chopped onion salt and pepper banged on a frying pan no oil...served on toast..lush
4621 2018-09-08 20:32:43 Tikka Masala ground lamb with roasted garlic & olive oil couscous... for MY dinner tonight. 
4622 2018-09-08 20:32:30 Me: I think the SUC needs an oil change. 
Mom: Ok I’ll go get more oil. 
Me: No, mom like change the filter and some general maintenance? 
Mom: Well last time you said this I just put more oil in and it worked fine.
4623 2018-09-08 20:32:29 Spanish Rice:
2 cu Rice, 8 oz. Tomato Sauce, 1 Chicken Bullion Cube, 4 cu Water, and about 2 Tbsp Oil.  Optional seasonings you may add are Onions, Cumin, Garlic, and Pepper to taste, though I recommend at least a  tsp of Onions and Garlic and a dash of the Cumin and Pepper.
4624 2018-09-08 20:32:14 しぬ
4625 2018-09-08 20:32:05 Nigga it’s called oil and highlight.
4626 2018-09-08 20:31:57 ว่างใช่มั้ย
4627 2018-09-08 20:31:46 But the oil companies and weapons manufacturers don't have time for that.  I mean like Wolf Blitzer said do you really want facts to get in the way of those companies going broke (I'm paraphrasing but he said basically that same thing).
4628 2018-09-08 20:31:38 Scratch the mayo and drizzle a little good quality extra virgin olive oil. It’s a Greek BLT, delicious and healthier.
4629 2018-09-08 20:31:17 When Islam co existed with other religions things were just fine. And then came the waves of Wahabi imams from Saudi Arabia..fuelled with oil $$$ they spread out across the globe and things have gone to hell in a hand basket ever since.
4630 2018-09-08 20:31:00 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
4631 2018-09-08 20:30:58 None of it was US taxpayer money.  It was all frozen Iranian oil revenue, stuck for decades in international banks due to sanctions.
4632 2018-09-08 20:30:38 flax oil! barleans has a lemon flavor!
4633 2018-09-08 20:30:28 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.
4634 2018-09-08 20:30:08 Establish a credible, well equipped laboratory first then brag, and done forget to equip the lab with honey and oil testers.
4635 2018-09-08 20:30:02 Quatar reported a growth in exports after blockade forced them to redirect exports. Perhaps a lesson for Canada, rapidly grow new markets for our resources, do more transformational processing in the supply chain and export finished goods, take oil/water guarantees to US away.
4636 2018-09-08 20:29:42 Look at all the oil spills on top of that bitumen parking lot, anyone cleaning those up?
4637 2018-09-08 20:29:34 Deep Jyoti teri deep kab jalegee  go back and check crude oil price and petrol price during UPA before tweeting u slave !!
4638 2018-09-08 20:29:30 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!
4639 2018-09-08 20:29:25 They only love your dark skin if its drenched in oil girl, they wont even look at you twice at a grocery store

4641 2018-09-08 20:29:07 Would you mind please summarizing the meaning of this discussion? and implications regarding oil price over time. Thanks.
4642 2018-09-08 20:28:22 getting an oil change?
4643 2018-09-08 20:28:20 Venezuela got big oil stock. USA cia started & played dirty games they say allegedly to destabilize govt. & to get new puppet to run country & oil to usa
Hollywood plot frm reel to real life..
4644 2018-09-08 20:28:10 @APPropst Since Venezuela is such a large producer of oil, and that by the end of the year economists are speculating that production will drop 800,000 to 1 million barrels, will that result in a significant increase of US oil prices?
4645 2018-09-08 20:27:59 you personally... Do you own a large corporation? Or are you part of the wealthiest 1 %? How much extra are you seeing on your check? Did you get a raise because of it? And do you feel comfortable having dirty air andwater, and letting them dig for oil in national parks?
4646 2018-09-08 20:27:57 I hate oil changes bc then I have to hear about the other crap wrong with my car
4647 2018-09-08 20:27:37 got the klairs vitamin c serum two weeks ago  i think im gonna tgry oil blot sheets bc if i wear a lil makeup my skin sweats it all off in like 10 mins i need smtg to get the excess shine off hhhh
4648 2018-09-08 20:27:36 A lot of Californians do stand with a Trump and can’t wait for Jerry Brown to get out of office.  Praying that the citizens of California wake up and fire these nut job Democrats and hire some common sense conservatives.

4650 2018-09-08 20:27:29 They're squatting on 80% of SYria's oil and collaborating with the US occupation while oppressing all dissidents. QED.
4651 2018-09-08 20:27:25 I would like to know why University of Findlay is the Oilers, as there is no Oil in Ohio
4652 2018-09-08 20:27:09 Agreed.  #Godspeed
4653 2018-09-08 20:26:53 It's a con artist marketing term trying to distinguish a concept like "health" or "wellbeing" in general use form Our Magic Expensive brand of snake oil. Either the person using it is the con or the mark. No exceptions.
4654 2018-09-08 20:26:51 Snake oil to the cynic
Is often holy water to the eager
4655 2018-09-08 20:26:30 he needs all the nail oil 
4656 2018-09-08 20:26:27 I didn’t know Turkey had nukes... that’s interesting. Especially considering their bid to become apart of the EU. I’m gonna actually follow that up. With Saudi, I don’t think they have nukes, saying that, Saudi can get away with a lot cos the US relies upon them for oil stability
4657 2018-09-08 20:26:10 Last night Nicki Minaj was giving me big breasted Siberian tiger who survived an oil spill realness. #TeamCardi
4658 2018-09-08 20:25:51 it's delicious. the oil in mayo makes it very moist.   you can't taste it as mayo at all.
4659 2018-09-08 20:25:38 #UGAvsSC  That commercial with the battery and oil filter...they walked out of the store without paying
4660 2018-09-08 20:25:30 His fingers pompously traced along the vial of sage-scented oil. You want to lick that vulnerable slacker all over.
4661 2018-09-08 20:25:18 #Graze's fries are made from fresh cut Kennebec potatoes, twice-fried Belgian-style in Non-GMO rice bran oil and seasoned with kosher salt.
4662 2018-09-08 20:25:05 I felt like the pregame meal consisted entirely of edibles and CBD oil...
4663 2018-09-08 20:25:03 No filter.
4664 2018-09-08 20:25:00 WD40 is just mineral oil.
4665 2018-09-08 20:24:57 This is a very good point, and it's how you get the most people bought in.  People that don't care about CO2 end up caring about dependence on foreign oil.
4666 2018-09-08 20:24:50 I like driving my car after an oil change and a tire rotation. So smooth! 
4667 2018-09-08 20:24:44 Nothing drain battery more faster than a fluctuating network, your battery will just be going down like an engine that just discovered crude oil.
4668 2018-09-08 20:24:26 Parents do some crazy things with their children. Man left his 2 children about 3 and 4 years old inside the car wash/oil change joint lobby while he drove around the building and sat in line to get his car washed. I watched them until he returned wtf.
4669 2018-09-08 20:24:21 Absolutely no comparison between us and Venezuela which has been hit by a fall in oil prices and USA Sanctions.  Do inform yourself before tweeting such rubbish.
4670 2018-09-08 20:24:14 What the f......?

Gamora had literally grabbed him by the hair and was pulling him toward the bedroom.  He barely had time to snag the bottle of oil before being forced to follow her.

The assassin’s pert butt twitched quickly as she walked fast to toward the bedroom, her ~
4671 2018-09-08 20:24:13 How can anyone buy more of his snake oil after seeing it was useless for 8 years. The FDA should have him in jail  for defrauuding the people
4672 2018-09-08 20:24:05 I wanted to cook mushrooms but i didn't buy oil
So i remembered my sister had olive oil
So i messaged her to give it to me
So she ignored my messages
So i spamed her with emojis
So i called her
So she answered
So she said she was smoking so i had to come
So i ran to her apartment
4673 2018-09-08 20:24:04 anything that Trump could possibly do to help Putin more than Obama did. Putin and Iran's leaders probably laughed their asses off about the way they took advantage of Obama. So far DT's policies are mostly less pro-Putin than Obama's. especially on oil production.
4674 2018-09-08 20:23:40 Mix up some olive oil with some basil, parsley, minced garlic, thyme, oregano, salt & pepper. Give Mini some Italian bread to dip in the oil. It gets the olive oil down and is fun and delicious for Mini.

Try to make it a regular staple in your meals. It works wonders!
4675 2018-09-08 20:23:10 @JerryBrownGov has given oil companies 20,000 new onshore permits since 2011! The climate crisis demands more than bare minimum offshore bills! No new permits! #BrownsLastChance
4676 2018-09-08 20:22:41 Diobu. 
I haven't stayed or spent much time there but I have heard so many legendary tales about that part of Port Harcourt.
An endless oil reservoir from which PH comedians drill.
4677 2018-09-08 20:22:30 Thanks for this. Emirates are saying oil is too high. They have the wrong planes for a high price environment.  4 engines going the way of the Concorde. Interesting times.
4678 2018-09-08 20:22:12 Pre race coverage is live right now , the @ProStockTour Lucas Oil 150 qualifying and main event is coming up @Riverside_NS #LucasOil150 @LucasOil
4679 2018-09-08 20:22:11 It's storing the garlic in an anaerobic environment that's the problem, not just garlic generally. You can make garlic-infused oil but the garlic has to be sterilized somehow.
4680 2018-09-08 20:21:48 psa if y'all need the VERY BEST thing to shave with: 

Coconut oil
Olive oil
Honey 

and if u rly feelin it, an essential oil of your choice. 

u welcome
4681 2018-09-08 20:21:36 Clinique's Beyond Perfecting Foundation actually absorbs excess oil. I also like YSL Fusion Ink foundation that has great coverage.
4682 2018-09-08 20:21:36 It’s probably not healthy for the lizard, though. You could see one had oil in its mouth.
4683 2018-09-08 20:21:27 Decided to walk down to the Goombay festival in Asheville, and while much smaller this year? They still had amazing food. I also got a killer little free neck massage with essential oil. Now to process photos before my girl Katarina’s birthday show tonight.
4684 2018-09-08 20:21:23 New hairspray is life!
4685 2018-09-08 20:21:12 You've bought the @CPC_HQ line that Canadian oil is the "cleanest, most environmentally-friendly energy in the world" haven't you?
4686 2018-09-08 20:21:04 Time for an update of the jug of oil that never goes empty
4687 2018-09-08 20:20:50 Don't you dare, Moonmeme ! I have a freaking bottle of oil with me !
4688 2018-09-08 20:20:26 @tedcruz would've eliminated the IRS (with a flat tax of 10%) as well as oil & gas subsidies within his first 100 days. Cruz would have tripled Border Patrol and enforced immigration laws. He'd have eliminated welfare to illegals. This great nation of ours would be ... different.
4689 2018-09-08 20:20:14 Ranga you are classic example of fraud intellectual for sale,I know u lack guts to take on ur paymasters but let me teach u

Oil bond debt was taken to give relief to millions of consumers but bullet train debt has been taken to fulfill stupidity of ur boss

Wear saffron chaddis
4690 2018-09-08 20:20:10 Can't believe if you are a real football fan that you don't have the knowledge of knowing that most if not all teams cheat in someway. Jerry Rice said he used gloves on his hands. Mark Schlereth (spelled wrong) said they used oil on their opponents.
4691 2018-09-08 20:19:34 Put Vaseline afterwards and remove with baby oil. Might help. 

This, compared to the others, has been great.
4692 2018-09-08 20:19:23 HEAR ME OUT OKAY oil companies are  therefore will end the world #illuminati
4693 2018-09-08 20:19:21 The people of Oil, IN need to be informed!
4694 2018-09-08 20:19:12 Trump supporters listen to trump lie about how great he is and believe the snake oil salesman; that’s what’s wrong.
4695 2018-09-08 20:18:59 オイル、君なら地球を救える。
4696 2018-09-08 20:18:56 2 for 3...
But Fuhr was the best Oiler goaltender of all time. And this coming from a guy who credited Cujo with getting the Oil to the playoffs at all singlehanded for two years.
Coco won the big game like nobody else in the #Oilers uni.
4697 2018-09-08 20:18:48 Ur mcm uses bio oil on his face with the decadent west for one evening thank u my dude.
4698 2018-09-08 20:18:43 what to oils to put on 
- coconut oil
- aloe Vera 
- Vaseline 
- almond oil
- onion juice 
- olive oil
- lastly Castor oil 
don’t use these oils on if you are allergic. Test these out first before you put one of these on and use a cotton swab to put on eyebrow .
4699 2018-09-08 20:18:39 Venezuelan oil isn't good quality. Worse, the infrastructure and human capital in their oil industry is garbage thanks to the Chavistas. 

American refineries can process heavy crude but they can also process light sweet from North Dakota. 

This is just Trumpian belligerence.

4702 2018-09-08 20:18:07 Al Nusra?  You’re gonna sit here stone faced and claim Al Nusra holds the entire province? I don’t deny the west secretly funds and trains rebels, but it’s in the US & the entire West’s best interests to dethrone Assad. Oil is a reason, but certainly not the only reason.
4703 2018-09-08 20:17:59 Lower the room temperature
Use the “4-7-3” method
Hide your clock so you can’t see the time
Avoid naps during the day
Listen to relaxing music
Exercise during the day
Use lavender essential oil in a diffuser or put it on your wrists
4704 2018-09-08 20:17:59 Going for the oil option! I’m going to do this!
4705 2018-09-08 20:17:41 Easy. Turn off the taps to our oil, fresh water and hydro.
4706 2018-09-08 20:17:30 omg williams friend is dabbing oil called 'roadman' and he calls it burnt tire nd he goes 'hmm, the one time you wanna smell the 12th of july' LOOOOL

4709 2018-09-08 20:16:53 Or you could just use avocado oil
4710 2018-09-08 20:16:51 Olive oil production, 2017. (tonnes)

4711 2018-09-08 20:16:40 Indeed, those who say Blair went to war for oil need to present evidence to support it.  Without facts, there is no debate, just childish mud slinging.
4712 2018-09-08 20:16:37 A little olive oil and pepper. Or a tiny bit of melted butter if you’ve no nice oil!
4713 2018-09-08 20:16:32 America is a mess. In the pursuit of oil, they are letting their country and its citizens suffer. Mile upon mile o homeless, desperate people living on the streets
4714 2018-09-08 20:16:29 Char grill aubergine 
Scoop the flesh, chop with garlic
Serve with olive oil

One jar tahina
Chickpeas, garlic, lemon, salt
Add water and blend

Roast five red peppers
Remove seeds and skin, slice flesh
Add olive oil, garlic
4715 2018-09-08 20:16:04 lol it's not the dirtiest oil in the world by a long shot.
4716 2018-09-08 20:15:55 So far so good! You might want to start putting beard oil in that bad boy
4717 2018-09-08 20:15:49 Today's news is tomorrow's bogpaper. Yet we still have to provide energy reliably, cheaply & on-demand, and all the products necessary to keep up safe, which absolutely means OIL, GAS & COAL.
4718 2018-09-08 20:15:46 Mix 3 cups green beans with 1 cup basil. Add generous amounts of Olive Oil. Squeeze out excess liquid Serve warm.

4723 2018-09-08 20:14:35 England is not self sufficient in fact most western countries are not they depend on the resources of the 3rd world in other words you cant stop them from coming here but still want to have access to their oil land and minerals etc
4724 2018-09-08 20:14:27 The economy isn't diversify let's be sincere. We rely on oil too much. We basically import even to toothpick, we aren't exporting nation.. Diversify is a big one and restructure so each region can grow at their own pace and face their resources.. These are part of sowore plans
4725 2018-09-08 20:14:16 Im getting an oil change at @jiffylube and this lady working here is being such a fckin bitch wtf im about to run her over

4728 2018-09-08 20:13:46 So. Very. True. Canada has had record train transport of oil...while pipelines are proven 99.9999% safe.  Alberta can’t get a break, can’t get a line built to access any market!

Details coming soon.
4734 2018-09-08 20:13:23 Westfield Grand Park? Lucas Oil?
4735 2018-09-08 20:13:05 I agree, and religion is quite a motivating factor when you want young, angry men to overthrow a government you don't like, be it for oil or Israel. Uk gov did  same trick in Northern ireland. Whipped up anger among young protestants to get them to murder native 'catholics'
4736 2018-09-08 20:13:01 Without a polar ice cap there will be no danger of an oil tanker hitting an iceberg up there. #ClimateChange #GlobalWarming
4737 2018-09-08 20:12:39 And now there we go.

You embarrass yourself instantly.

You understand the difference between debt and deficit? You can't because you would never say that.

Also Venezuela is oil rich so how can we have a similar model?

Lol you messed up big time.
4738 2018-09-08 20:12:36 Actually, swamplands are protected by EPA/ Clean Water Act; your oil and coal “leaders” are actually trying to kill the swamp. #facts #justkeepgolfing

4742 2018-09-08 20:12:20 I also use avocado oil on a cotton round as my night time moisturizer. It’s amazing!!! It’s good for dry skin. It treats eczema and psoriasis! 
Too heavy for daytime though. But does wonders
4743 2018-09-08 20:12:17 Olive oil and fresh basil 
4744 2018-09-08 20:12:15 The big b thrives from no oxygen. Oil keeps it out and grows in it.
4745 2018-09-08 20:12:02 Norway, one of the "greenest" countries on the planet, keeps pumping out millions of barrels of oil from the ground. Maybe you could start with them. I'm sure they'd be more receptive. 

Bottom line, if we take it out of the ground, it's going to end up in the air.
4746 2018-09-08 20:12:00 So you prefer record unemployment, low wages, spying on reporters, selling guns to criminals, economy-killing regulations, loss of manufacturing jobs, death blows to coal industry, dependence of foreign oil to what we have going on now???
4747 2018-09-08 20:11:58 Is this oil?
4748 2018-09-08 20:11:57 i just got burned by my engine’s scalding metal because volkswagen refuses to write “twist off” anywhere visible on their oil caps
4749 2018-09-08 20:11:36 Which oil company wants the coup?

4752 2018-09-08 20:11:28 Lessening our dependence on oil, not eliminating oil, is the future.
It's not scary. There will be just as many jobs in renewables, and the environment will get a break, win win.
4753 2018-09-08 20:11:25 Exactly, there was more to the #IranDeal than meets the eyes, oh I know Valerie Jarrett lives with him & Michelle, wonder why? Could it be she oversees his "war room" functions. That's the house the FBI needs to be raided. @POTUS

4758 2018-09-08 20:11:05 @ShashiTharoor sir.. the petrol and diesel price is higher, even when the crude oil price is low when compared to 2011-2012. I like to request you to reduce the half SGST in those states where congress is in government. It would be historical decision if congress does that.
4759 2018-09-08 20:10:53 Russian oil.
4760 2018-09-08 20:10:45 FYI fellow car slobs: @jiffylube vacuums your car when you get an oil change.
4761 2018-09-08 20:10:42 1. Kinder Morgan is not an oil company.

4767 2018-09-08 20:10:03 Have you ever found yourself avoiding the stairs after “#LegDay”? 

We get it. 

Fortunately, magnesium oil is a natural muscle relaxant and when applied to sore #muscles it can promote #recovery and reduce #soreness.
4768 2018-09-08 20:09:59 Is it me or has anyone noticed when the oil/gas prices started going a little crazy? Maybe like the last Secretary of State, the big Exxon oil man after he left office? Knowing the inner workings of the White House and a little payback with his big oil buddies? Anyone?
4769 2018-09-08 20:09:48 Indeed it was; still is if you listen to his speech. He has been and still is the snake oil salesman

4778 2018-09-08 20:08:43 Why does Californiahave the income? Because it's filled with hard working Americans of all ethnicities and races who burn the midnight oil for themselves and their families. Then you have the audacity to demand welfare payments from them.
4779 2018-09-08 20:08:31 Oh it's agony. Poor thing. Get some olbas oil. I Put it straight on my face. Makes your eyes water but it's a welcome relief. Sounds gross but I've been known to snort salt for relief in the past. Its fucking agony at 1st but it helps!!
4780 2018-09-08 20:08:25 By the grace of Allah SWT, huge deposits of Oil, Gas and Minerals have been discovered in Pakistan. The timing is amazing where all these corrupts mafia type leaders are on the run. It needs 3 to 4 years for Pakistan to be operational in oil extraction. Plz define ur plan on this
4781 2018-09-08 20:08:22 I could just cum in my pants knowing I get to step foot into Lucas Oil Stadium and watch Andrew Luck play some football again tomorrow
4782 2018-09-08 20:07:50 Because unless there are consequences for those who wage aggressive war for oil and other resources wars will continue and we will all die. My children will die. It's not a game.

4792 2018-09-08 20:06:20 Ironically (maybe), defense contractors and oil companies being in bed with gov't for subsidies is more akin to fascism than socialism. I think.
4793 2018-09-08 20:06:09 the gang solves the oil crisis
4794 2018-09-08 20:06:04 Zou Oil of Olaz nog steeds zo goed werken als vroeger en heeft Kruidvat het nog?
4795 2018-09-08 20:06:00 Dude. WTF. All he needs to do is pour a LOT more oil on and they’ll be able to wiggle themselves free in 5 seconds. Not rip them off the thing slowly. What a jackass. 

I use these traps to keep SCORPIONS out of my house and have an occasional gecko to free. It’s not that hard!
4796 2018-09-08 20:05:55 Aka snake oil salesman.
4797 2018-09-08 20:05:54 Malaysia is good in Durian, Palm oil & Rubber... 

Signed Mou with China on more of a trade by barter & not just on the goods and services for money like other countries, not to exclude Naija did.

Once we never look inwards, how can we get better????
4798 2018-09-08 20:05:51 he's a character but he is forcing boeing, lockheed, etc to advance the space program

look how much trouble john delorean got in for just trying to build a better car

elon is taking on the oil cartel, the car cartel, debatably the pentagon, etc

not a saint by any means, ofc
4799 2018-09-08 20:05:50 Oh, you! Or it could hit $710 (OIL if you look at it upside down) and then we could all take some dabs and eat baked beans
4800 2018-09-08 20:05:30 Nobody should’ve introduced my mom to cbd oil cause she be over doing it

はい！お待ちしてます！
4802 2018-09-08 20:05:25 Getting to puff my own resin is mind bending. To think, seeds plus soil plus water would equal OIL. Its just too crazy. & super satisfying. If u don't grow your own weed - u should start...
4803 2018-09-08 20:05:13 Thank yu for everyone who offered assistance with checking my oil lol me & big red appreciate you
4804 2018-09-08 20:05:12 Y’all have nice cars/trucks but all them check engine, oil, tire, etc. lights on? 
4805 2018-09-08 20:05:01 What are talking about? Energy isn't reserved for solely inefficient, dangerous, economically unsound, and bad for prosperity coal and oil.
4806 2018-09-08 20:04:59 Never conflate our economy with Scandinavian countries. They have natural resources such as oil to aid their economy, we have a service economy. We could to a degree have a manufacturing economy. What we CANNOT have is an economy based on rich natural resources, eg OIL
4807 2018-09-08 20:04:58 Present!

4808 2018-09-08 20:04:57 Hi Sarah, we don't ise palm oil but one of the secondary surfactants we use can be derived from palm oil, our main surfactant is palm free. We are currently working towards being 100% palm derivatives free and are very close to acheiving this.
4809 2018-09-08 20:04:46 Remembering a time when I was canvassing for tx campaign for the environment, on fracking, in highland park, (aka oil money, usa) and some adult man told me they didn't believe in the environment
4810 2018-09-08 20:04:26 can my car’s bitch ass oil change ITSELF i don’t wanna fucking go anywhere today
4811 2018-09-08 20:04:23 I don't think that's why we are there. Iran and Syria have been fighting for a while, Kurds and so on... Russia just like America is more interested in the natural oil reserves that Syria sits upon. Like Afghanistan. We don't waste time defending dirt. Trust me. LOL
4812 2018-09-08 20:04:07 興奮してめさ迷ってるので待ってください！！！！！
4813 2018-09-08 20:03:58 What are our trade items exactly? Hope it's not just oil?
4814 2018-09-08 20:03:54 Join me and tell palm oil regulator @RSPOtweets to stop certifying rainforest-destroying company @Indofood now

4817 2018-09-08 20:03:45 But back to your original premise, that it's not about religion. I get the oil part and the Israel part, just think we can't ignore religion completely, as a third component of success, failure, or motivation, if not overarched by shared, intrinsic values.

4819 2018-09-08 20:03:32 Ultimately, it’s about a New World Order, a world government. Lefties think it’s about money, oil and drugs, as you said. That’s just the means to grease the wheels at a lower level. The powers that be have all the money they could ever need
4820 2018-09-08 20:03:23 He's just a Snake Oil sells man. Smooth talking liar.
4821 2018-09-08 20:03:08 i need to get a commission of one of my characters gettin dipped in Phyrexian oil super bad, goddamn
4822 2018-09-08 20:02:45 That is very mechanical for those of us who only know a fuel tank, tyres, and where to put the oil
4823 2018-09-08 20:02:28 @AJWVictoriaBC @jjhorgan Excellent article!   The Saudi Kingdom is #3 in the world in military spending.  Well funded "enviro-marketers" must be called to account for ignoring how the profits of Blood Oil is used to slaughter and oppress.  Canada must wake up to reality.
4824 2018-09-08 20:02:26 @realDonaldTrump I need asses I need to charge you could put Sean on the come down here about this Crud oil
4825 2018-09-08 20:02:25 There wasn’t going to be a visit to the beach today.

No toasting marshmallows over the smoldering body of an enemy.

No stories about marshmallow trees of Madagascar.

But there was going to be oil and lots of skin.  Tony’s fingers skillfully untied the strings holding her ~
4826 2018-09-08 20:02:17 It's just that they're two separate issues. When accidents occur companies are held liable for cleanup of course but this is what happens when we have such a Reliance on oil. America is a disgusting country and they've ruined more than they've ever helped.
4827 2018-09-08 20:02:06 okay why has my dad told me he has cannabis oil and my bro told me he gets highu wot
4828 2018-09-08 20:02:06 Amazing! Even the Rolls Royce had a river of green oil 
4829 2018-09-08 20:02:06 I really love how organic coconut oil cleanse and remove the left over makeup residue under the skin! No makeup remover can ever do such a job. It sterilise deeeppp inside the skin which gives feelings of freshness and purity.
4830 2018-09-08 20:02:04 I agree with your that sometimes need out weighs taking best player but not always. Oil also needed D worst then a center when they took Mcdavid but sometimes the player out weighs the need.
4831 2018-09-08 20:02:01 I can't believe I spilled coconut oil over 100 boxes of eyelashes and had to buy more . Such a waste of money. Shit was expensive
4832 2018-09-08 20:01:54 I'm still in jumper and jeans mode, hanging on grimly. But I have ordered more oil. :)
4833 2018-09-08 20:01:50 Blah blah blah...be real..that will NEVER happen...a OIL EMBARGO is much less expensive and more effective and the USA won't even try an oil EMBARGO it will bring gas pricez up..
4834 2018-09-08 20:01:31 He also had a reporter removed. Obama said, in an angry and cocky manner, "Your In My House".  Obama, is so arrogant, he actually thought, He owned The White House! Never has Obama been for the people, whose White House,  we allowed him to occupy.  He's  a snake oil sells man.
4835 2018-09-08 20:01:20 In the age of Tesla it’s interesting how primitive oil changes and fueling up with gas feel now.
4836 2018-09-08 20:01:06 Just in case you didn't know North Dakota has a leak that is 400000 tons of crude oil. Are we going after anyone for that. No. So is the saddest at all is it's a guilty there guilty leave it

4838 2018-09-08 20:00:57 This wallpaper smells like oil and love.
4839 2018-09-08 20:00:56 But what about Finland? And Sweden, not much oil there? Same socioeconomic system. And Norway doesn’t pay its welfare with oil money, all the oil money is saved into its national sovereign wealth fund.

4841 2018-09-08 20:00:44 Problem: it still costs more to get fracked oil out of the ground than it's worth on the market.
4842 2018-09-08 20:00:37 Those oil sands employed East coasters.
4843 2018-09-08 20:00:33 This was a bad day for the people at the oil change bay to catch me with Florida Gators floor mats.

4845 2018-09-08 20:00:18 Olive oil on a cotton round as a makeup remover!!!  I’m allergic or sensitive to EVERY other makeup remover. Doesn’t break me out, aggravate my eczema, and good for my skin 
4846 2018-09-08 20:00:17 The "amomynous" letter reveals confusion is seeped from the head all the way down.  If the oil is tainted,be it the head of your household, the head of your state, or the head of your country.  It flows from the head down. I do hope you can comprehend. The USA is contaminated.
4847 2018-09-08 20:00:07 do you guys have any recs on a good cleansing oil??? the one im using rn doesn’t effectively take off my makeup 
4848 2018-09-08 20:00:04 WHAT was the crude  oil price in 13 ? atleast Kangress never preached big and betrayed like MODI..
kangress was always corrupt..modi was supposed to be a savior but outcome is disappointing and no rescue in sight...

Modi will come back in 2019 by comparing himself to rahul..
4849 2018-09-08 19:59:44 .@JerryBrownGov sign an executive order to shut down #AlisoCanyon.  Also, ban fracking and stop allowing any more oil/gas wells, and move toward shutting the existing ones down!  It's time for #BrownsLastChance

4854 2018-09-08 19:59:16 I love the oil paint in the artistic brushes. Also, under painting the round brush for base colors then the flat brush on that for shading has a nice effect for me.

4858 2018-09-08 19:58:22 If we had the oil reserves, then we might. Thankfully we don't. We have enough of the USA's 'influence' for now.
4859 2018-09-08 19:58:20 Good luck paying Rs500 for a liter of Oil since transport through Kerung for only 4 months/year would mean the traders would stock up and release only when price increases>
4860 2018-09-08 19:58:13 She’s needs to put some baby oil on the shower floor for when gets out. And have belt ready and waiting.
4861 2018-09-08 19:58:09 If the oil is too high then the tortilla will burn before the meats cooked... just sayin
4862 2018-09-08 19:58:02 Stocked up on gas, and oil and food here in central FL. Get ready everyone.
4863 2018-09-08 19:57:58 Search Eagle Spirit Energy to find info on the Eagle Spirit Pipeline @CalvinHelin spoke about. A versatile multi-faceted pipeline which would movie oil sands product for export.  LPC must listen.

4865 2018-09-08 19:57:43 Maybe men should be sterilized. There ya go, let’s do that.
4866 2018-09-08 19:57:42 Thi get it, but it’s not socialism. Their system works because everyone is looks the same, it’s cold AF, they have oil and the country is small. I live in Canada, not US btw.

4872 2018-09-08 19:57:01 There is more to life than just cribbing about rising oil prices
4873 2018-09-08 19:57:01 Outside for a moment. Saw people in clothes made of polyethylene terephthalate protesting oil exploration… I wish I could say that this level of ignorance and irony was uncommon around these parts. (No.) I'm sure they "love science" too (as long as they don't have to learn any!)

4878 2018-09-08 19:56:01 Used olive oil on my furniture, cause of the smell of furniture polish....The olive oil took off  marks that were there forever...Excellent!
4879 2018-09-08 19:56:00 I’m getting my car’s oil changed and the one guy is singing along to the radio. “You Spin Me Round” is playing 
4880 2018-09-08 19:55:59 Want to diminish stretch marks? Use Vitamin E oil and Cocoa butter. You can find both at your local drug store. Use DAILY.
4881 2018-09-08 19:55:54 This lady came in asking for caca oil... she was actually looking for cocoa butter lmaooo
4882 2018-09-08 19:55:54 Sala Sanctions Policy is the best way to weaken the clerical regime of Iran. The Iranian government, with the money of the oil and the people's money and putting pressure on its people, helps the terrorists to commit crimes and cause insecurity.

In case you thought that all gyro places are the same

4886 2018-09-08 19:55:16 It was never about oil or heroin. It's always been about the petrodollar. It isn't about taking possession of the oil, it's about demanding that you only sell it using the US dollar, enabling us to remain the Global Reserve Currency.
4887 2018-09-08 19:55:08 Oh, let's not forget it's another oil rich country. So many countries needing help but we always seem to go to war with oil or mineral rich countries. It would be nice to fix Iraq at least to back what it was before we invaded.
4888 2018-09-08 19:55:08 I'm no chef, but even ready-made fish fingers with a side salad gets 100/100 with a little feta, oil & oregano ;-)
4889 2018-09-08 19:55:06 New reasoning for maulings, “you weren’t spraying lavender oil for the dog”.

4890 2018-09-08 19:55:04 so did jackson use lube or oil to slide in them latex pants? i have so many questions.
4891 2018-09-08 19:55:01 You're a snake oil pedlar. What are you selling here? You know nothing about genetics or health. If you truly believe you can change change your genetics by eating an avocado & going down the gym, you have issues.
4892 2018-09-08 19:54:57 Free education, free healthcare, workers rights, huge welfare benefits, pensions, all paid for by taxes. Also their major resource oil is owned by Statoil which translated to English means “State Oil”. As in it’s owned by the state! Are these not socialistic?
4893 2018-09-08 19:54:02 But what about when the people don't understand a issue look at vitamins we could have had regulation stopping people from selling snake oil, but the people were tricked into thinking it wasn't necessary and that it was a waste. So now we have kids dying because people are dumb.

4901 2018-09-08 19:53:16 He/ his campaign mastered exploiting fear. He’s a conman. A snake oil salesman.
4902 2018-09-08 19:53:12 Time to combine the two side behind the same idea: Synthetic fuels.

Big Oil needs a carbon-free alternative to its current product. Nuclear can provide this & facilitate a coordinated changeover to the new fuels whilst preserving much of their sunk investment - time for a truce?
4903 2018-09-08 19:53:11 1/The majority of this list is weak and he did nothing to affect many if these things.  You can't say abortion is down when he supports proc choice.  You can say oil and natural gas is up when he supports many losing alternate energy.  There are many more examples.

4907 2018-09-08 19:52:57 The demographic part os cited from #Iraq’s Parliament debate. Oil statistics I always verify with the Grand Ayatollah of energy economics, Dr. @AL_Khatteeb. They  vary from time to time, but not by very much as to undermine the claims in previous tweets.

4980 2018-09-08 19:43:04 There are some food-grade essential oils you can apply in small amounts to flavor food, but you can’t cook with them. If you make a raw chocolate recipe, consider adding a touch of some orange oil in order to help boost your immune system.

4998 2018-09-08 19:40:42 @AmericanAir So I’m sitting in the plane which is almost empty and waiting for the “maintenance” to put oil on the engines, fligt delayed.

5018 2018-09-08 19:38:38 It’s entirely fair to celebrate the end of fossil fuel extraction in the North Sea whilst still lament the socio-cultural implications of the communities affected. Forgive those of us who work in the transition away from oil and gas but grew up as children of the industry.
5019 2018-09-08 19:38:37 Today I went to target amd bartered two shirts for some motor oil, shampoo, a toothbrush, and some clearance office supplies.

5021 2018-09-08 19:38:26 Great Utopian ideology. The KEY word in your statement being "transition"! Not "KILL" OR "DESTROY" or DECIMATE", but to "TRANSITION". It is a process. Not a sudden widespread total stoppage of ALL oil projects. THAT is NOT "transition"!

5038 2018-09-08 19:36:51 And went worse with money conversion New BsS = old BsF 100,000, products price and salary control, and cheaper things as services and oil raised a lot in prices (international price of gas, being productor) And a dumb minister saying a employed can work 800 hours a month!
5039 2018-09-08 19:36:51 The alternative is for all humans everywhere to agree on everything and live in harmony with no conflict. You must be a genius to come up with gold like that. I can't believe nobody has made use of your highly practical ideas.
5040 2018-09-08 19:36:40 I doubt it. State ownership is the key. Otherwise private interests always manage to buy off local politicians one way or another. We may not like Saudi Arabia for myriad reasons but their state owned oil company Saudi Aramco is the same reason for their wealth as well.

5048 2018-09-08 19:35:35 Big business invests to build better cars, make oil extraction cleaner, develops new drugs and makes better iPhones. I don’t mind big business making our lives better.
5049 2018-09-08 19:35:29 That's defintely something I relate to. It could just be a build up in the ear, in which case olive oil drops or spray a few times a week could help. But if not, please don't be afraid to have your ears tested -

5055 2018-09-08 19:34:52 I predict Alex Jones will die under  mysterious circumstances. A “heart attack”, huh? Yeah. Right! That’s what they want you to believe man halliburton orchestrated the bp oil spill...
5056 2018-09-08 19:34:42 The Toronto Sun's owner Postmedia is itself owned by an American hedge fund, the publisher of the National Enquirer sat on its board, it has a mandate to promote the oil companies and to promote American style conservatism in Canada. That's why they write this crap.
5057 2018-09-08 19:34:40 Have you tried virgin pressed rapeseed oil as an alternative? It’s a little more tangy and floral - a great glass with the lobster!  
5058 2018-09-08 19:34:37 Ingested coconut oil is ACTUALLY unhealthy in the long run as the fat density can build up and clog arteries. The only way to flush out is with a mix of activated charcoal and warm water

5063 2018-09-08 19:34:16 The university of Houston had a plaque up in the old student center that laid out the Houston family’s nonsense story about where the name originated (in Scotland from those nephews of Macbeth who overthrow Macbeth cause why not). House-town makes more sense to me.
5064 2018-09-08 19:34:04 Keep CBD oil Over the counter! Especially brands that have zero THC.
5065 2018-09-08 19:34:00 and lets not forget the foreign pro oil financier's named the Koch Brothers. Are you a mouth piece for them? Which includes lower taxes for all, especially supportive of corporate welfare for oil companies! Like somehow they can't survive on their own.

5069 2018-09-08 19:33:11 Oh, there has certainly been improvement in the oil sands, some of it funded by carbon-tax revenues. However, there's still a huge unfunded liability in the form of overburden disruption, tailings ponds, etc.

5088 2018-09-08 19:29:51 It's only failed because countries like the US and Saudi Arabia have the power to destroy economies while they play oil tycoon simulator on a global scale. If anyone should be acted on, it's the US.

5095 2018-09-08 19:29:26 Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world, receives loans from Russia and China, and arms from the Cuban dictatorship.
5096 2018-09-08 19:29:14 The importance is Venezuela is corrupt as fuck and fallen victim to the oil curse where Norway has managed its resources responsibly and not fallen victim to oil curse and is largely free of corruption.

5103 2018-09-08 19:28:24 The logic of not letting the scarcity value of land fall into private hands is impeccable. See Hong Kong or the Norwegian Oil Fund. Or do you think British and Norwegian policies in these cases were wrong?
5104 2018-09-08 19:28:21 And Oil prices.
5105 2018-09-08 19:28:19 Government can increase oil prices electricity prices.. Impose tax. Take further costly loans to build dam...in this way... Poor will share all the burden... But yeah they cannot request their wealthy ones to contribute. Waah rhe Liberals. #DonateForDams #DamFund #PTI

5111 2018-09-08 19:27:10 CBD oil is a scam cause they market it as “made from hemp wink wink” and it is but it isn’t THC so it won’t get you high. Also this place was selling a pint of CBD ice cream for $20
5112 2018-09-08 19:26:51 The government doesn't cut a check to oil companies. I hate this leftust bullshit lie. Oil companies get the same tax breaks for capital expenses every other business does.
5113 2018-09-08 19:26:46 Attack Canada when we sell our oil to the US for a 1/3 of the world value? Then your 1% billionaire population is paying off foreign protesters to stop us from getting our oil to world markets? Not good enough though?

5124 2018-09-08 19:25:02 Like we didn't see that coming. Another nail in the Canadian oil industry's coffin. Another nail in the Canadian economy's coffin.

It doesn't matter who wins next October this country is going to go into a recession regardless.
5125 2018-09-08 19:24:54 First, Bill is sexually dangerous to the country.

5140 2018-09-08 19:22:16 That's not recycling. Recycling is when one makes new product from plastic which can in turn be recycled again. As for making diesel oil: It's much easier to burn the plastic in power plants and refine the diesel oil from new crude oil.

5170 2018-09-08 19:17:00 McCrone the report's biggest warning was not about the oil - it was about our own currency, from independence, which was to be seen as an economic threat to England from its last colony , post independence.

5174 2018-09-08 19:16:44 Oh man, would be a real bummer if it got DDoSed you lead tainted snake oil salesmen.
5175 2018-09-08 19:16:43 But isn’t coconut oil drying because it’s fast absorbing...?
5176 2018-09-08 19:16:43 I’ve been trying to get my mom to try cbd oil so she can maybe chill a little bit but she keeps saying she doesn’t do drugs. Millennials, amirite???
5177 2018-09-08 19:16:40 And big oil and trumpbutt will quickly shut that sh*t down.

5179 2018-09-08 19:16:30 I was so blessed to see it as well, I was surprised to see that oil patches were still floating on the water there.

5182 2018-09-08 19:15:40 Poloz should have hicked in 2015, he panicked due to the oil collapse. As a result, a blow off top in credit was created. Big mistake. Now he has no bullets left and is foreced to hike into weakness. The lower mainland will be ground zero for Canada’s debt implosion.

5188 2018-09-08 19:15:08 Frankly, the day that significant trading of #derivatives (gold futures, oil futures, options, etc) starts happening on #blockchain, I expect a #bubble that will make previous #crypto bubbles look tiny in comparison.
5189 2018-09-08 19:15:07 I walked away for a minute to get water, and when I came back someone had left a box of Trojan Exstacy condoms + a bottle of mineral oil laxative on the counter
5190 2018-09-08 19:15:02 Massive oil leak. I thought there might be a small one but it’s basically flooded the whole car!!

5196 2018-09-08 19:13:44 Pls has power supply improved in your area? Are u satisfied with the public hospitals, have our universities improved?? Has Boko haram being wiped out? We still produce crude oil and import fuel.not much has changed..not much.

If it's  a war in the mid east with  US involved then its either to do with oil or Israeli interest, usually both. If Islam was the prob, why did the US arm and train the jihadis?

instead he was a snake oil salesman

Would you vote for his candidate?
No, neither would most of us

5225 2018-09-08 19:09:37 Every day I learn and never will I stop. Fatty liver did you cook with oil? Just asking not being a dick. All I want is truth. I take advice well. In saying that 20yrs of pills prescribed to me. Turn PB life style and off pills. But honestly would love a PM. And chitchat.
5226 2018-09-08 19:09:27 Huge difference between making a profit from the scarcity value of natural resources, or just doing so by turning them into goods/services.

The former is morally reprehensible, while the latter a force for good. 

Just what do you think the UK does with North Sea Oil?

5229 2018-09-08 19:09:10 The thing you can't forget about Murkowski is that:

a) she is owned by big oil
b) loves to openly flirt with Rick Perry, in open session of the US Congress
c) loves deregulation
d) hates Caribou
5230 2018-09-08 19:08:52 Decided to try wearing perfume today, ended up so annoyed with it I scrubbed it off my skin with cleansing oil for 10 minutes and then scrubbed off cleansing oil smell with soap ://// it’s still there though
5231 2018-09-08 19:08:25 Once my phone charges I guess I’ll go get my oil changed and car inspected since the nice officer let me go this time 
5232 2018-09-08 19:08:15 Bitumen is much dirtier than Hibernia oil. Alberta has plenty of sun and wind. The largest wind farm in Canada is in Pincher Creek. I suggest they start "weaning" themselves off of fossil fuels and utilizing green resources.
5233 2018-09-08 19:08:05 These insane comparisons to Standard Oil and NEXT YOU WONT BE ABLE TO GET WATER BECAUSE OF YOUR OPINIONS.

5239 2018-09-08 19:07:17 Hmm they might not be as weak as we think. People say ISIS (which is clearly not US funded) is dead, but they have TONNES of money left from their glory days as oil producers. It’s not the ammunition that’s the issue, its the rebels morale and in-fighting. Groups splintering, etc
5240 2018-09-08 19:07:10 The real thing is US dont give a shit about democracy or human   rights.  They only give a shit about oil and profits.
Dont pretend you wanna help countries.
5241 2018-09-08 19:07:07 What the fuck? I've been spending upward of $25 a night on breads and oil. Not to mention the vinegar
5242 2018-09-08 19:07:03 From my friends from Kurdistan and Syria, who know the US are helping rebels/ISIS, they say the reason is oil (as usual) US, Saudi and Turkey pipe vs. Russia and Iran pipe to feed Europe. Syria refused Saudi deal. Then all this started.
5243 2018-09-08 19:06:58 95% of Venezuelas exports is oil and that is state owned. Does that tell you something?

5247 2018-09-08 19:06:05 It’s not really a pipeline project, the pipeline is already there. It’s about doubling it up, for the purpose of putting it in a boat and transforming Vancouver and the Burrard Inlet into a major oil shipping port. 

How does that benefit you Charles?
5248 2018-09-08 19:06:00 nah i’ll eat the platter of veggies tomorrow (the hummus has oil and stuff added to it soo im too scared to it it) rip idk any nice low cal dip or something for them
5249 2018-09-08 19:05:57 Yeah because Norway relies on oil  too, and things there are just the same as Venezuela.  Nothing to do with the failed ideology of socialism whatsoever??!!

5258 2018-09-08 19:03:49 Known for its vibrant culture, Nigeria has the largest economy in Africa with a GDP of over 376 Billion U.S Dollars. This can be attributed to its high population and presence of oil.

5259 2018-09-08 19:03:29 If it weren't for oil, nobody would care. Let them fight over their sandboxes and leave them be. Middle East has been fighting since before we can remember why. Get out now. Everyone has left. Let them have the dirt.
5260 2018-09-08 19:03:25 Different oils work best for different skin! Rosehip oil and vitamin c work best for me! Other ones like jojoba oil and vitamin e help wonders! Make sure they are all natural 100% cold pressed! Tanning helps a little as well along with dairy free or gluten free diet!
5261 2018-09-08 19:03:20 Have you tried essential oil?

5263 2018-09-08 19:03:14 and Standard Oil never drove out a business dependent on oil for its operation.  Nor does the sun ever rise on a Tuesday.

5271 2018-09-08 19:02:07 If only Russia would manage to export that stuff. Most of export revenue still comes from oil and gas. The future is in industry and services. Just look at China, their doing it right.

5298 2018-09-08 18:58:53 TMX is a pipeline that will move oil produced by US companies to US refineries for US consumption so why would the US oppose it?
5299 2018-09-08 18:58:50 Well they’re safeguarding the rebels, whom they fund. You’re correct in saying the West have their own interests first & foremost, but the West know Assad out of power is the best thing for them - from financially to oil production & also for Homeland security purposes.

5312 2018-09-08 18:56:54 Oil doesn't vote, gender does Trudeaumustgo
5313 2018-09-08 18:56:39 It's been 1,000 days since the BP oil spill and the Gulf of Mexico still has not been restored.
5314 2018-09-08 18:56:24 I have a deep love for finocchio - roasted w/ olive oil and a drizzle of balsamic vin, shaved in salads, seeds in salami or sausage, nibbled on after dinner for digestion, diced up in my damn tuna salad sammy! Nom nom!
5315 2018-09-08 18:56:12 i take CBD oil, 20% and 3 drops twice a day, means i no longer need arthritis injections which ruin my kidneys

i do the same as you, no potatoes for me atm
5316 2018-09-08 18:56:01 Does growth=wealth to all or just the select few.
Regs about drilling for oil in fresh water, was that a nonsensical idea? I suppose there were people trying to protect potential drinking supplies but now you can have oil exploration instead.
Short term prosperity=no safeguard
5317 2018-09-08 18:56:01 Olive oil works for me, your facial skin is really delicate so I don’t recommend using bleach or dish soap bc it may cause ur skin to have a reaction
5318 2018-09-08 18:55:47 Coffee grounds is great for exfoliation
Tea tree oil to fight acne
Coconut oil for moisture
Apple cider vinegar to tighten pores
A few drops of honey to help with skin’s elasticity
...just to make a few ingredients
5319 2018-09-08 18:55:46 Pipelines don't burn energy, they transport energy.
The world will need more energy for the foreseeable future, for the time being, we MUST be the world's #1 supplier instead of OPEC dictatorships and Russia as our oil is produced at the highest environmental and labour standards
5320 2018-09-08 18:55:30 Harry Potter on TV, shorts swapped for joggers, candle burning, and a huge bowl of pasta & truffle oil. I’m calling it, it’s Autumn in London.
5321 2018-09-08 18:55:29 Working at a baby oil factory squeezing babies all day must be hard work
5322 2018-09-08 18:55:15 Trump won because he is a snake oil salesman that suckered a lot of poeple like you
5323 2018-09-08 18:54:52 Ummm, actually we already have lots of tidewater access to ship our oil. Ask any Newfoundlander. #Hibernia #TideWater #StopKM
5324 2018-09-08 18:54:51 Dairy farmers should tell people they feed "vegetable waste" instead of PK until manufacturers start listing palm oil as an ingredient instead of "vegetable oil"
5325 2018-09-08 18:54:49 I haven’t said anything about pressure anywhere. You have me confused for someone else. Also, I don’t know what a pressure meteorologist is but my speciality is pressure metrology. Specifically, R&D for high pressure, high temperature gauges to go in oil wells.
5326 2018-09-08 18:54:41 It is closer than you think. I'm not saying flip a switch. I'm staying start the investment in green tech with similar funding from when we developed oil sands extraction and stop investing in expanding oil production.

5328 2018-09-08 18:54:27 ยัยBAซื้อลังโคมมาแสนถูกแต่นานๆมาทียิ่งกว่าปรากฏการณ์ธรรมชาติ! Biodermaคือต้องบินยุโรปเลยอ่า
มะก่อนก็คิดว่าน้ำมันไม่ดี แต่นั่นแหละพอลองวิธีใช้ oil base เช็ดมันดีที่ไม่ต้องรุนแรงมาก ละล้างน้ำเปล่านวดหน้าไปก่อนค่อยลงเจล ปรากฏว่าดีแฮะ ดีกว่าดันทุรังใช้ Water base แล้วเอาคสอ.ไม่ออกค่า

5332 2018-09-08 18:53:25 Tell me more about #Estonian aero-space industry, satellite launches, heavy machinery production, nuclear ice breakers, etc.

I am sorry that #Estonia is not an energy superpower and has to buy gas/oil from abroad. Sounds like you think about #RussianEconomy quite a bit .
5333 2018-09-08 18:53:23 That is not Kenya, it happened in Cameroon, there are more videos worse than this, genocide now happening in Southern Cameroons. The UN knows about this but it seems they are being bought over by oil money to keep silent.

5336 2018-09-08 18:53:09 now hold on, we all have a gazillion $$$$ and make tons of money from big oil, no wait...
5337 2018-09-08 18:53:01 ??with argan oil
5338 2018-09-08 18:52:57 Who is making the money from that oil?
5339 2018-09-08 18:52:56 And I may be economically and technically feasible some day.  In the meanwhile, mine coal and drill for natural gas and oil.
5340 2018-09-08 18:52:52 #IRAN'S ZANGANEH HAD DISCUSSIONS AND AGREEMENTS WITH RUSSIAN, TURKISH ECONOMIC OFFICIALS OVER IRAN'S OIL EXPORTS: TASNIM. #OOTT
5341 2018-09-08 18:52:47 Coming from Mr. Sunday Brunch himself... so, can you except that oil in the pan is an acceptable way of cooking steak! Season the steak, oil the pan & make sure that oil is SIZZZZZLING 
5342 2018-09-08 18:52:24 And we should probably stop letting a handful of people do all the talking. They push for oil because that's what is good for their wallets. We need to push for what's best for our people and expanding oil production isn't that.
5343 2018-09-08 18:52:13 Well, as of today there is a diaper shortage and there have been recurring power and water outages. Don’t forget Venezuela can still sell its oil and move money through the international banking system...
5344 2018-09-08 18:52:13 That's another major caveat in this.  Oil production produces a lot of things in health care that saves lives.  There's really no guarantee that oil production hasn't been the reason the human race is still around.  No proof it is though either.
5345 2018-09-08 18:51:53 A dish, just not oil down
5346 2018-09-08 18:51:43 US foreign policies; See a democratic government with oil suffering a global market crash, place sanctions on the country instead of sending aid, decry the evils of socialism as their country suffers from US sanctions, and finally instigate a coup to put a dictator in charge
5347 2018-09-08 18:51:41 "AVRO ARROW AVRO ARROW" I shriek as I slowly shrink and turn into a wannabe oil state
5348 2018-09-08 18:51:24 I was kinda stoked to see a Lil Baby’s Ice Cream in center city but apparently they sell CBD oil ice cream? I listen to Sawbomes. I know what’s up.
5349 2018-09-08 18:51:00 Awe I wish all your pain gets cleared out so you can heal & relax better.

I heard ginger, peppermint, chaparral or cinnamon tea might be good for the pain.

However I do love peppermint oil.

I use peppermint oil for when I have any pain.
5350 2018-09-08 18:50:47 Visiting my Mom’s today and she’s cooking and couldn’t get the vegetable oil bottle open so she stabbed it viciously and made her own pour spout. #momskills #cookingpro #momsrock #nomatchformom
5351 2018-09-08 18:50:47 Lifting US sanctions would pretty sure help out a lot.. wouldn’t surprise me if the US gets oil out of this.
5352 2018-09-08 18:50:44 Why dont you find and support the good guys like @350EastAsia ? and Canada oil sands are polluters too
5353 2018-09-08 18:50:44 We should be traveling by water pod tubes, saves in gas, time, and dirty engins. Underground water tubes would save roads and oil to make them, not to metion the oil to make the tires and polution made. Food for thought.

5357 2018-09-08 18:49:31 Finally, getting an oil change for Baby Blue. Cause I have to be an adult and take care of my child. #VWBeetle #imnotarealmomcalmdown

5361 2018-09-08 18:49:10 To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified.

5363 2018-09-08 18:49:05 Of making oil deals with Iran during Iran hostage crisis. That’s way worse in my opinion.

5365 2018-09-08 18:48:55 Oil. 

Butter can't reach as high temperatures and tends to burn quickly. Hence why "Beurre Noisette" exists (translated to mean Burnt Butter) 
5366 2018-09-08 18:48:52 Screw you “Easy Date Night Makeup” tutorial! Instead of looking like a “sultry vixen” I look like I was attacked by a gang of zealous 3 yr olds with oil pastels!

5370 2018-09-08 18:48:13 Pasta sauce! Just cut them in half, throw then in some medium hot olive oil in a frying pan, add some diced onion and garlic, let it cook until the tomatoes just melt. Season with salt, basil, oregano and chili/black pepper and a dash of sugar. Toss with pasta, done.

5378 2018-09-08 18:46:52 Why yes, I am worried that this rabble-rousing conman and snakes oil-salesman was allowed to keep peddling his lies and snake oil and violate the rules on these social media plattforms for this long without being punished. Took them far too long to ban his ass.

5381 2018-09-08 18:46:25 Went to get an oil change at the dealership and the guy tells me I need my cabin air filter replaced. He quoted me $70. No thanks cause I can get a filter from Autozone for $8 and change it myself in like 5 mins thanks to YouTube. 

Car people are legit scammers. 
5382 2018-09-08 18:46:08 Try castor oil, hair oil, however Libya.
5383 2018-09-08 18:45:50 Open the hood and poor a puddle of oil on the the floor. You’re welcome!
5384 2018-09-08 18:45:49 Your eyes on oil. That's the problem! 

Get people to get off their asses and be productive!
5385 2018-09-08 18:45:39 Bullshit

If Venezuela holds the biggest oil reserves in the world, the US have already invaded Venezuela.
5386 2018-09-08 18:45:21 I keep getting these emails about CBD oil and I’m just like aight send em my way then
5387 2018-09-08 18:45:10 coconut oil is my hairs best friend
5388 2018-09-08 18:45:06 I suspect one US refiner is doing exactly that (moving crude from opaque storage, to reported storage), and it is not costing them to do so, beyond lowering the global price of crude oil.
5389 2018-09-08 18:44:59 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.
5390 2018-09-08 18:44:56 Great. Wind in Oklahoma is taxed. Not# subsidies and even thwarted by our oil overlords.

5393 2018-09-08 18:44:42 Also note: "From 1974 to 1995 a federal law called the National Maximum Speed Law restricted speeds to 55 mph... with the intention of reducing fuel consumption after a 1973 oil embargo". Anthropogenic #climatechange is a greater crisis, for which this restriction should return!

5402 2018-09-08 18:43:27 I’ve started using garlic in my magic act. First I start by crushing it, adding  basil and some pine nuts, and then I blend them altogether with some parmesan and olive oil...

Then, hey... pesto!

5407 2018-09-08 18:43:06 Yeah.....Last time I was there was 2013. Def geeked up for a road trip. And looks like no forest fire smoke like there was last year in MT when I was there. Picked up my bike from oil change this morning...ready to head out Sunday.

5409 2018-09-08 18:42:47 Hey Simon, I luv Sunday Brunch and watch every week, may I ask you a question?
I watched Saturday Morning Kitchen today and Matt Tebutt put oil in a frying pan then a price of steak, I’m sure you have told us to oil the meat not the pan, is this the case and what’s the difference

5414 2018-09-08 18:41:22 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.

5416 2018-09-08 18:41:17 The main thing to do is find why it blocked in the first place.
Driving characteristics, a fault with EGR or sensor? Type of fuel or oil used?
5417 2018-09-08 18:41:06 So I met someone from a professional fraternity for robot makers but when I first heard “robot fraternity” all I could think of was oil pong and “you up?” texts in Python
5418 2018-09-08 18:41:03 Having a truck is expensive  I literally spended $195 for gas, oil change, new carpets and air refreshers  but at least she’s lookin and smelling good

5424 2018-09-08 18:40:33 Trump was taught by the best of the worst, Roy Cohen! He's always been a snake oil salesman and a "want-to-be", who will never be ANYTHING but a low life thug!
5425 2018-09-08 18:40:30 Also, I believe oil is at the root of all this.
5426 2018-09-08 18:40:27 Jab oil bond ke Paise utar jayenge.. tab mil jayega.. ab yeh na puchiyega oil bond kisne issue kiye..
5427 2018-09-08 18:40:23 I understand the transportation of crude oil presents many risks. And I'm not defending LNG in any way, but as a byproduct of crude drilling, how does natural gas pose a risk of poisoning the people? Isn't transporting the LNG safer than crude oil pipelines? I may be mistaken.

5434 2018-09-08 18:39:38 question for CBD users: has vaping helped you out with things like stress and anxiety? or maybe ingesting oil via tinctures? my stress and anxiety is debilitating lately and flower isn't legal in tx. :c
5435 2018-09-08 18:39:38 Honestly I used coconut oil and it helped a lot with itching and swelling and redness. It made it just look like overly dry skin rather than major psoriasis patches. If you don’t mind still having patches but having better symptoms, that’s what I recommend 
5436 2018-09-08 18:39:25 Charlotte’s Web. Really the best stuff. They called it the “Hippie’s disappointment” because it contains so little THC. But it’s very potent with the cbd oil and though they are based in Colorado, some of their hemp crop is grown in Kentucky.
5437 2018-09-08 18:39:22 Anchovies are fantastic.  Not so much when the tin catapults across the kitchen sending oil everywhere.  I now smell like I’ve spent the last fortnight sleeping rough on a fishmonger’s floor.....  I’m surprising popular with the cats though
5438 2018-09-08 18:39:04 They stay flirting with me when I come get an oil change  & they always give me discounts 
5439 2018-09-08 18:38:51 @VP and now you and the national security advisor will make every decision about Syria, we respect it. I just emphasize that we will not step back on the boycott of oil, until November 4, Iran's oil exports should reach zero, zero, zero, zero.
5440 2018-09-08 18:38:48 Saddam Hussein had a stargate. It was never about oil 
5441 2018-09-08 18:38:30 Bluegrass Hemp Oil is where I got it.
5442 2018-09-08 18:38:28 Returning the kiss, wrapping her arms around him, Gamora nodded. 

"It's an important task. I think you should definitely stay with me and take care of the oil duties. Don't forget any of the valuable bits either."
5443 2018-09-08 18:38:27 The result is that in subjects, like science, in which a consensus does exist, equal weight is given to fringe opinions that are increasingly out of touch with the reality.

Oncologists are pitted against crystal therapists.

Climate scientists against oil industry lobbyists

5445 2018-09-08 18:38:02 Friendship with @AGKootenay is such a gift: we got pedicures, coffee and did a delightful olive oil tasting so now we have some Work Olive Oil to share.
5446 2018-09-08 18:38:00 I got mine from Bluegrass Hemp Oil which I think is in Lexington
5447 2018-09-08 18:37:58 Venezuela has a lot of oil.  If Bush was in office, that would automatically raise cries of ulterior motives. Is Trump more honorable than the Bush family?
5448 2018-09-08 18:37:51 Maybe because his son-in-law had a controlling interest in Iraqi oil? The Desmarais family are the corrupting influence behind the Liberal party.
5449 2018-09-08 18:37:41 No, I think that is just one of the ways oil companies have cut costs. They were the first in line to be cut. The oil industry is constantly cutting costs and jobs. 
We can plan for those job losses, but that plan can't be reliant on the industry determined to shed workers.
5450 2018-09-08 18:37:33 I just noticed that my body oil from VS is missing and it’s been missing for a good 4 months lol
5451 2018-09-08 18:37:29 In uniform ya need to be extra vigilant of the dripping oil that the folding creates.
5452 2018-09-08 18:37:27 VASELINE IS FOR PROTECTING FISHING GEAR FROM SALT WATER BUY COCONUT OIL IT TASTES GOOD
5453 2018-09-08 18:37:21 It’s nice to know that US officials are worried about world democracy and not just Venezuela’s oil reserves, right? This is more likely a play by the WH to pressure Maduro into talks than something actionable.

5455 2018-09-08 18:37:18 Sweet! Both teams appear to be leaking a little oil, but it is obviously a decisive series for both. I don’t c a wild card team coming out of NL East. 
Have fun my friend.

For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:
5457 2018-09-08 18:37:10 OK, let me ask you a question: what's stopping an oil company (let's say Suncor for shots and giggles) from investing in clean energy if it's profitable.  Oil companies aren't beholden to oil, they're beholden to shareholders and profits.
5458 2018-09-08 18:37:00 Prospect for oil at Federal Triangle.
5459 2018-09-08 18:36:59 No, it's correct. The province of Jaen (in Andalusia, south of Spain) makes 75% of the world's best olive oil.
5460 2018-09-08 18:36:53 i spilled like half of my $54 korres oil down the sink im sticking my hand in a blender
5461 2018-09-08 18:36:51 I Luv Vodka!  Spritzer for your linens: 1c Vodka + 1c H2O + 16 drops essential oil: to disinfect & freshen
5462 2018-09-08 18:36:39 Well who lead this country out of recession from the Bush's tax cut. A housing crisis and banking crisis and auto industry crisis. Oil over a 110/ barrel, and  over $4.00 a gallon. Did Trump have any of those problems? I think not those darn facts again.
5463 2018-09-08 18:36:25 Then quite simply Sir, take your abhorrent arrogance & bully boy tactics ELSEWHERE!  Your attitudes towards your host country ISNT APPRECIATED OR WANTED. Probably best you look to move somewhere else because your threats WINT BE TOLERATED. Oil & water can't & will NEVER MIX!
5464 2018-09-08 18:36:14 What does “sustainable” palm oil certifier @RSPOtweets have to do with worker exploitation? It still hasn’t condemned shameless #palmoil company @Indofood. It’s time to force @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s business partner out of the market!
5465 2018-09-08 18:36:10 I heard castor oil works thooooo
5466 2018-09-08 18:36:03 Get some peppermint oil and rub wherever you’re cramping at, it eases them
5467 2018-09-08 18:36:01 Petroleum should not be put into the human body, vaseline is a petroleum product, and should only be used for keeping hair dye off your skin, and keeping your feet moist when you're sick so slather it on your heels before putting your socks on, but that's it. Go coconut oil...
5468 2018-09-08 18:35:56 I guess there was no feasible way to exploit Venezuela's oil reserves without getting their hands too dirty, so they backed off?
5469 2018-09-08 18:35:49 @sam_vinograd @FWhitfield @cnnbrk come on Venezuela!!! Again shoddy reporting!! “Considering a coup” and why would THIS dictatorial regime be considered for change? Africa and other countries have tons of dictators!! No mention about oil.. oil!! Oil! Geez you guys drop the ball
5470 2018-09-08 18:35:46 Sorry but Regime change for OIL is the wrong decision period. It didn't work in Iraq or Libya and it isn't working in Syria either. Millions of lives lost foe $$$ on OIL.
5471 2018-09-08 18:35:39 Do you realize that if that #FatNixon aids rebels in Venezuela to overthrow their government it will be at the behest of THE OIL COMPANIES? It's always money or OIL.
5472 2018-09-08 18:35:16 If you're open to moving you should think about the oil sands in northern Alberta, Canada. They have trouble recruiting enough people within Canada who are willing to move there and so they sponsor foreign workers and may even give you a relocation package if they like you.

5474 2018-09-08 18:35:09 ...and the world doesn't give a damn...all we want is wood.. Plam oil...
5475 2018-09-08 18:34:58 Expert tips  :u need to use more oil to fry!. Never cut the potatos round, but like fish scales.Once fries are done,remove all the oil and throw them on the previously beaten eggs (for that pan 4/5 eggs). Put everything back in pan with no oil. Once is coocked turn around
5476 2018-09-08 18:34:49 How disgusting and vile, absolutely repugnant sentences. Those poor people being ruled by demigods. The world should refuse to take their oil, the only precious thing they have to offer.
Lock their royal family up instead and execute them, the world would be a far better place.
5477 2018-09-08 18:34:45 Should take more cod liver oil.

5480 2018-09-08 18:34:30 Oh and also hot oil If the place offers them
5481 2018-09-08 18:34:27 #RiseForClimate Hemp is illegal as a result of PROPAGANDA which was made up to push hemp out of the market, so plastics and fossil fuels could take its place. Crude oil is ruining our ecosystem and people are STILL stupid enough to believe hemp is a drug!
5482 2018-09-08 18:34:12 Hahaha! Everybody tries to get in on the act! I’m sure the cars are smacking their oil holes at the thought of pumpkin spice oil. Swoon.

5487 2018-09-08 18:33:55 Contaminate the water and the land. Oil pipelines have had hundreds of spills in the past 2 years. 1,300 crude oil spills since 2010 amounts to one every other day.

5491 2018-09-08 18:33:26 I'm stunned at how far the MSM misses the story. Where is the Woodward & Bernstein of this generation? Follow the money. From my couch I found Nune's went from $2M in donations to $7M in 1yr. Oil exploration Co sends him to Azerbaijan. Meets with Russians. Wake up.
5492 2018-09-08 18:33:11 You mean the businesses running on oil industry expense accounts?
5493 2018-09-08 18:33:09 Ready to have a kickass Saturday with you all!  Trying to do what we couldn't get to yesterday - naked, oil show, shower! Hell I might even shave my legs...we'll start the leg hair bidding at 900 tokens 
5494 2018-09-08 18:33:03 America wants the oil.
5495 2018-09-08 18:32:53 I love when I wash and coconut oil my locs and its drips down and moisturizes my skin too.
5496 2018-09-08 18:32:50 If you do. (Hope you do.) May I suggest you get a few boxes of 64 crayons. Or better yet, few big boxes of CrayPas (oil pastels).
Mad is right!
5497 2018-09-08 18:32:48 Where does all the waste water go?

I know people in the oil field that want to leave it better than they found it.  But!
Decisions are made by people in Houston

Waste water disposal is passed to a new waste water industry allowing waste water producers a pass the buck excuse.
5498 2018-09-08 18:32:40 Yup, he has a huge oil company but mainly gets his money from embezzlement

We need to stop expanding production. We need to expand green industries.

5540 2018-09-08 18:26:55 Eau de perfum is better b/c it’s made with oil which makes the scent last longer. Eau de toilette is water based, so your scent fades throughout the day. It’s not worth it lol

5543 2018-09-08 18:26:09 We can't sell what we don't have. Bitumen and dilbit is some of the dirtiest sludge there is, and only barely qualifies as oil after they adjusted the definition of crude. Ethical? On whose land do you suppose those billions are being made?

5547 2018-09-08 18:25:30 Agree completely. Where in “pandering is idiotic” do you see throwing everything away? We need to use the oil industry to phase the oil industry out. They won’t like it.
5548 2018-09-08 18:25:22 The Manny Noakes, Keogh studies also found high SFA diets to impair arterial function using butter. 
Coconut oil has been shown to do the same just a few years ago.
Even a weight loss RCT low fat vs low carb showed significantly impaired endothelial function in the low carbers.
5549 2018-09-08 18:25:18 I will for sure! I’m a fan of olive oil for everything but I know frying wise it wouldn’t work
5550 2018-09-08 18:25:07 @bukolaSaraki sponsored National Oil Spill Detection Response Agency Amendment Bill 2012, which was aimed at putting a halt to oil spills in the Niger Delta, the Gas Flaring Prohibition Bill 2012, the Climate Change Commission Bill 2013 @SirMide @Afolabibayor @DeleMomodu
5551 2018-09-08 18:25:06 Wait...
I'm as left as anyone, but let's look at reality here... We're not going to run out of oil for many generations, if ever. And we're never going to run out of water. Ever.
Don't let the Conservatives confuse you or TRICK you into positions adverse to reality!

5564 2018-09-08 18:23:11 There are 300K citizens under poverty line in #Basra & 100K citizens live in random housing w/out basic services. Basra produces 2.5mbd of #oil (@ $60/b=$150million/day =$55billion/year).  Not to mention other revenues from gas & non-oil revenues (ports...etc.).
5565 2018-09-08 18:23:09 Who stands to gain from this? Like Iraq had a shitload of oil! Oil again? Or what?
5566 2018-09-08 18:23:06 It sounds idiotic, and maybe it is, but we need the revenue from oil production to transition away from our dependency on oil.  If everyone in the world threw everything they owned into a hat and humanity could work as a team it could happen very quickly.  But greed...
5567 2018-09-08 18:22:38 Yeah. Let's stop all oil production completely. Right now. Everything. 
And let's just see how THAT screws both Alberta's and Canada's economy. Oh right. You don't care if families are homeless b/c you want everything shut down now.
5568 2018-09-08 18:22:34 “Is olive oil made with olives??”
5569 2018-09-08 18:22:33 Personally, I'm not convinced that lunar latency would be a big problem (only a little one). Folks steer oil tankers into port with a 30-minute delay between input and maneuver completion, and lots of games and toys in my life included a substantial lag - you get used to it. 1/2

5572 2018-09-08 18:21:46 While getting my oil changed:

Venezuela is where it is because the US want to break it and take the oil
5574 2018-09-08 18:21:39 The cheerful economic news is largely absent from worker paychecks. Average hourly wage growth has been 2.7 percent over the past year, very low. Making matters worse, a surge of inflation, driven by higher oil prices, has clawed back almost all those wage gains
5575 2018-09-08 18:21:39 "Venezuela resists US hegemony" How stupid are you? USA is the top client of Venezuela's oil
5576 2018-09-08 18:21:10 So glad we don’t have oil rigs off our coast to worry about

Almonds + prunes = DELICIOUS combo
Brie cheese + granny smith apple slices = also delish together
5581 2018-09-08 18:20:10 That's the essence of my question. Would I really be increasing my risk level to go further overweight in #uranium stocks? I used to think that was true... but given U risk/reward now & high risk to oil/gas/gold/silver plays in market correction, changing my mind to "not sure".
5582 2018-09-08 18:19:57 In fact every thing in Venezuela is exploding. Oil loading terminal are in pathetic state even scary to work on it.
5583 2018-09-08 18:19:50 Getting my oil changed and I’ve seen about 6 different mechanics come and look under the hood. Each one walks away looking confused. That’s got to be a good sign right?
5584 2018-09-08 18:19:40 I’ll have to research that one I’ve been trying to figure out what oil I want to use and I’m currently experimenting. I’ve heard great things about almond oil!
5585 2018-09-08 18:19:40 Of course Honorable Putin is concerned with the citizens. It can't possibly be about oil can it? Maybe we should give Putin a halo or a crown?
5586 2018-09-08 18:19:34 Thank you! People always look at me strangely, when i tell them about combining lavender w/peppermint..But its so good & lavender works WONDERS for allergies!! I also steam water & put a few drops of lav oil & breathe it in. Amazing how well it works!

5588 2018-09-08 18:19:14 Thank you Jerry Brown. I don’t want to see or experience oil spills and tar washed up on our beaches and end up on bottom of our feet. And drowning marine life and birds and mammals of our Planet!!!.

5598 2018-09-08 18:17:42 Growing up under Lothian skies  with Mrs Ts slash and burn plan,  closer union with Europe was a counter balance to Westminster. Both distant bureaucrats one cleaned the beaches the other stole the oil revenues. Not a difficult choice really
5599 2018-09-08 18:17:37 Really, I should be using butter and coconut oil, in a blender to increase the amount of fat intake in the morning. I fast from 8am until 8pm and sometimes go longer if I can. I just got off my second dose of antibiotics, so next few months I'm back on weight loss mode.
5600 2018-09-08 18:17:37 The United States planning to oust Maduro had absolutely nothing to do with opposition to socialism on principle. It had everything to do with opening the world's largest oil reserves to American private investment and making sure all that oil was sold in dollars.

5604 2018-09-08 18:17:33 So u rather , walk on the beach and get oil “ tar “  on bottom of your feet. From possible oil spills on the coast ???. Really dude !. Think about it . When last time we had a major oil spill off shore ???. Let’s save our planet and our marine life ...

5619 2018-09-08 18:15:05 The notion that Americans on average are fat is based on BMI statistics which are outdated. According to BMI a body builder would be obese because he weighs a lot. In terms of fat % Gulf States are by far the worse because they are oil rich and unsophisticated in their nutrition

5631 2018-09-08 18:13:34 If we want to change - & we do - we need to set up a change plan over five to twenty years. If I ran things, I’d empower change through pre-peak-oil usage & revenues morphing into a zero-petro-economy by 2040. Pandering to oil is idiotic. Cutting our own throats is just as bad.

5690 2018-09-08 18:05:14 Sorry Tommy. Here you are out of line. Resorting to profanity and insults doesn't advance your position. 
We cannot just shut off all oil production. As Drew said, it has to be an organized withdrawal as we move to other sources, so we can maintain jobs.
That gives employees time
5691 2018-09-08 18:05:13 In 5-10 years we will have learned tons about what works and what doesn't a d we should be able to sell the tech elsewhere. But that only happens if we start investing now. 

There are good jobs to be had here vs vanishing oil jobs.

5696 2018-09-08 18:04:46 Middle East has too much sectarian/ethnic divide to even smell peace from a distance, especially being rich in oil which draws imperialists and then the extremist wahabism movement/religious fundamentalists, combing all of the above we get a great continental cesspool of chaos.
5697 2018-09-08 18:04:46 Also knowing that using oil and gas money on MF would be a great option but will probably never be done is irritating enough.

5708 2018-09-08 18:03:35 When I was in the Persian Gulf the oil in the air from all the oil fires was so thick it ruin my uniform and coated our skin.  No one knows what else was floating in the air.
5709 2018-09-08 18:03:21 olive oil is the best.  if you pour a bit more than he used in the video, they can often move themselves off. have set mice and rats free this way without having to handle them.

5711 2018-09-08 18:03:02 You’re such a fraud dude. We’d be using whale oil for lights if not for fossil fuels.
5712 2018-09-08 18:03:02 Big red in the shop , new brakes oil change , and anything else will be fixed by the end of todayy okurrt
5713 2018-09-08 18:02:45 How about snake oil.
5714 2018-09-08 18:02:37 People don't care enough. Even more die (or are crippled) just from working on oil rigs. Being a 'roughneck' or 'roustabout' is probably one of the most dangerous jobs there is! That's why those guys get paid so well (> $100,000 - $150,000/yr). Don't think I'd have the guts!
5715 2018-09-08 18:02:34 I do not care I'm beautiful and very rich 55555555555555555555 ถูกป่ะวะ
5716 2018-09-08 18:02:27 Slice it and make paninis. Cut up leftover pieces, drizzle with olive oil and black pepper, maybe parmesan,  and bake for croutons to sprinkle on a rich soup or salad.
5717 2018-09-08 18:01:56 Africa must unite , because when we Unite Africa we have resources that the world wants and needs , when we Unite with one African government , one constitution one currency , we will be the riches country on earth, because we will control our oil resources ,gold diamonds , more.

5720 2018-09-08 18:01:28 Although the government put "In God We Trust" on a dollar bill, they are not referring to God the Creator, but Gold, Oil, and Diamonds.
5721 2018-09-08 18:01:25 Oil Companies are stealing a Common people's hard earned money... Middle class like us will suffer a Lot... Central government must stop watching this Historic raise... They must do the needful to us!!!

5735 2018-09-08 17:59:55 These are not Christians, these are evangelicals who sell snake oil on the side. This is how they subdue the snake to extract the oil.
5736 2018-09-08 17:59:53 For. Two. Hours.
Today’s topic: oil is the best energy source, and climate change is not significantly affected by its use/extraction.
5737 2018-09-08 17:59:50 Would love a hot shower and an evening with the mrs, but I suppose engine oil and sleeping in a race truck will have to do 
5738 2018-09-08 17:59:49 Proper pizza with olive oil is supposed to be fine. It's the thick American dough base and odd toppings that are an issue. I've avoided them too. And yes, LOL.
5739 2018-09-08 17:59:45 これ、未来人見たらなんかの祭壇だと思われそう
5740 2018-09-08 17:59:32 Yes please.  This was something I studied in Swaziland 7 years ago.
There is also some evidence via Holland and Barrett "Marula oil contains four times as much vitamin C as oranges, is rich in vitamin E and is packed with high levels of oleic acid – omega 9 fatty acids – too."
5741 2018-09-08 17:59:18 Sir plz gareeb kisano ke baare me soche ..badhti oil rate se wo kaafi pareshaan hai...
5742 2018-09-08 17:59:11 I LOVE the face wash so far, a tab goes a long way and leaves my face feeling oil free and firm. And I haven’t opened the gel yet, trying to use the last of the garnier! I found them at target and thought I’d try.
5743 2018-09-08 17:59:08 Yikes, #palmoil regulator @RSPOtweets is greenwashing @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s business partner @Indofood. RT to tell the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil to punish Indofood for dealing in exploitation palm oil!
5744 2018-09-08 17:58:57 The thing that is going to happen in next 20-30 years is going to cause massive problems cause oil will run out and USA especially is  going to go into complete anarchy and USA will most likely look like Mad max world but with water now it most likely wont last forever but still
5745 2018-09-08 17:58:53 I might give a shot to CBD oil.
5746 2018-09-08 17:58:40 Just heard an old guy in the store ask where the "granola oil" is.  So there you go.
5747 2018-09-08 17:58:32 I’ve had Parmesan ice cream... pretty amazing. Mayo ice cream.... wouldn’t that really be olive oil custard?
5748 2018-09-08 17:58:31 I consider libertarians like Ben Shapiro to be political quacks. They're no different than the classic snake oil salesmen.
5749 2018-09-08 17:58:27 Every olive oil I use comes from Portugal
5750 2018-09-08 17:58:24 The US should stop the sanctions. Regime change for OIL is disgusting. For the US to let people starve for OIL is repugnant.
5751 2018-09-08 17:58:23 Pipelines were not built a decade ago because oil extraction from oil sands pre recession or early 2000s was not economically viable/feasible due to technological reasons, pipelines started coming into fold after production ramp ups and high oil price
5752 2018-09-08 17:57:50 I agree in theory but why not ween off of oil and towards green?
5753 2018-09-08 17:57:44 The socialist promise worked well in #Venezuela ... for the few elites and foreigners who bamboozled the entire nation into their dishonest socially fracked insurgiency.

5754 2018-09-08 17:57:43 How are you going to sell your snake oil now?
5755 2018-09-08 17:57:41 Venezuela has the world's largest oil reserve and the fourth largest gold mine on earth. The USA's corporate militarism is straining at the leash to export its trademark mass-murder, torture and plunder formula to that part of the world. What a disgusting thing is American power.

5757 2018-09-08 17:57:21 I wld also add tht liberals targeting other liberals, esp comparing thm to Trump (because rich white guy, right?) is phenomenally bad strategy.

5767 2018-09-08 17:56:18 Popcorn are normally fried in the same pot, in the same oil, at the same time and under the same heat conditions. But they do not pop at the same time. YOUR TIME IS NOT MY TIME but we’ll all pop.
5768 2018-09-08 17:56:07 Consolidation is happening because large multinationals are selling their stakes in oil sands because they see too many obstacles to achieve production and even then there are more obstacles post production like transportation. And this consolidation is happening with rising oil

5774 2018-09-08 17:54:58 So you’re not even aware that every single big oil company is preparing for the end of the oil reserves, even the Saudis are planing for it…

Can’t say I’m surprised.

5778 2018-09-08 17:54:25 I have no objection to patients using this for symptom relief. But as an alternative to chemo? There’s a lot of dangerous pro cannabis oil myth circulating
5779 2018-09-08 17:54:20 That's something I didn't even think about when buying Oreos as I am aware of the palm oil issues and the destroying of animals homes. I'll need to take a closer look at more of the things I buy now.
5780 2018-09-08 17:54:19 Since Albertans have known for many long years that they would not be able to depend on oil money forever, what has this particular oil worker done to re-educate and/or retrain himself for other work?
5781 2018-09-08 17:54:16 Buy EVs, invest in renewables and put the demand (oil & gas) side of the equation out of business...big oil won’t invest if the demand isn’t there.
5782 2018-09-08 17:54:16 Yea but it eventually went away never to return. Use vitamin E oil or neosporin on it.

5786 2018-09-08 17:54:06 when oil price are sky rocketing, then govt remembered that UPA had some oil bonds worth Rs 2,00,000 cr?  Were they sleeping earlier??
5787 2018-09-08 17:53:56 you do understand that structure was in place, Trumps people took  off regulations designed to avoid finacial bubbles like 2008 mortgsge housing fiasco... they did nothing but make finances a free for all...same w/ oil drilling - anywhere but near TrumpBOGUSNK = BOGUS
5788 2018-09-08 17:53:30 Cannabis Oil (THC loaded) is an anti-oxidant saturate. It stabilises free radicals. Google is a good starting place to learn.

5790 2018-09-08 17:53:20 UPA bought on credit card by issuing oil bonds to cap prices which this govt has paid. Amount 200000 crores with interest.
5791 2018-09-08 17:53:07 Few know that #Israel has a pipeline in #Iraq and #Syria. An oil pipeline. So why is the USA defending the oil pipeline FOR Israel?

5798 2018-09-08 17:52:17 How much coordination between US & TU. The Russia Turkey friendship for the past while has been a joke. Maybe Idlib can bring more cohesion between US & TU. For Russia its always been about oil flow into east Europe. That goal hasn't changed.

5817 2018-09-08 17:50:12 @Liz_Wheeler also it is not just "liberals" who are upset about what's happening to the environment. There are many things such as pollution, oil spills, fossil fuels, sludge dumping which contribute to this; also weather engineering.
5818 2018-09-08 17:50:10 Oh Jeri, I'm so sorry to hear you're sick. I know it sounds basic, but try peppermint oil. Or if you don't have that? Peppermint cordial. They sell the oil at drugs stores. It really helps with cramping, nausea and general tummy distress. Feel better soon x
5819 2018-09-08 17:50:08 Capitalism made nuclear, chemical and biological weapons which can murder billions of people whenever a government decides that another ruling class is a threat to maintaining the wealth of their asset-owning elite, or in the way of acquiring more wealth.

5828 2018-09-08 17:49:11 "Asked if the PUB would have the authority to recommend something like the use of oil and gas revenues to be applied to electricity rate mitigation, the premier said no."
That speaks volumes for me. Why even include the PUB if they can be Veto'd anyways?

5833 2018-09-08 17:48:55 I won't be voting NDP again. I've already cut off my donations to them over this stupid pipeline. We can't keep expanding oil production. We're too late to repurpose resources for social good. It's time to walk away and move on to better alternatives.
5834 2018-09-08 17:48:54 The real question is whether it will be contained to EM only or spread to DM as well

Bc of if EM are the borrewers, DM are the lenders

Russia and  LTCM default brought the crisis from EM to DM in the 90s 

Is there any catalyst today?

My bet is on the collapse of oil price

5837 2018-09-08 17:48:43 I’m not a big analytics guy so maybe that hinders my judgement but I don’t think Oil hiring Villman leaps them ahead of the top teams in the west
5838 2018-09-08 17:48:38 Arh well they only spray where ya point em,  I'm sure you wl of pointed that out to him  yep I'm only wanting a easier life on the spokes and underneath where she gets oil splatter 
5839 2018-09-08 17:48:23 Yup. It cost me £2 for oil & pens off amazon. I use it every day & it lasts. It softens cuticles too.
5840 2018-09-08 17:48:20 I remember the same with Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of Iran. Our relationship with the Saudis has always been a marriage of convenience.  The U.S. is poised to surpass Saudi Arabia next year as the world's largest exporter of crude and oil products. Divorce coming?
5841 2018-09-08 17:48:10 Oregano oil.
5842 2018-09-08 17:48:04 I use it topically on just about everything- mixed in w/ pain cream (then add a heating pad & you’re in heaven)! I have CBD oil mixed in MCT oil- you can cook with it or add drops to a beverage. Unless you use *CBD isolate* you do run the risk of a positive drug test.
5843 2018-09-08 17:47:58 I still don't eat Oreos because of the palm oil. Palm Oil is driving orangutans into extinction, possibily within the next 10 years, or less....i don't wanna support that. But yes, technically it's not an animal product, even though it's still bad for animals.
5844 2018-09-08 17:47:49 @DrDawnHarper hi , hope you are well . Just won’t to as a important question ...sever anxiety with crippling symptoms , limited on the meds due to my job (hgv ) so though if CBD oil ??? Your thoughts ?
5845 2018-09-08 17:47:44 I was using mealime (a meal planning thing I like a lot, though I have to doctor a lot of recipes) to make a stirfry with ground beef. I added the 2tbs of oil and didn't realize how fatty the beef was. Shit was delicious but it was an oil slick.
5846 2018-09-08 17:47:31 Oil should be illegal also.
5847 2018-09-08 17:47:29 All who want to start a big debate about it can, but I didn’t know there was Cassava oil down

5858 2018-09-08 17:46:25 What is the most interesting item most people leaves out about America's economy. Under Obama, there were an industry that kept his economy from posting a NEGATIVE QUARTER a few times.

OIL. An industry Liberals tried to destroyed in Obama's first few years. Mostly done on.....
5859 2018-09-08 17:46:23 You forgot Isis: no oil. Saudi Arabia: oil, and thus why they’re our ally. Energy independence, including electric, wave, and solar, is the answer.
5860 2018-09-08 17:46:22 Seriously?

5863 2018-09-08 17:46:05 Boko haram a terrorist outfit who follows Saudi Wahabism. Their role & mission is to keep Nigeria & neighbouring African Muslim  countries in the state of turmoil. #Nigeria  otherwise a rich in resources specially oil but facing poverty & hardship due to #KSA
5864 2018-09-08 17:46:03 @DrAlexGeorge help me out plz sever anxiety , crippling symptoms but HGV driver so limited on the meds I can take . CBD oil ???? Your thoughts ???
5865 2018-09-08 17:46:02 Arab to zamin se pani nahi nikal sakte oil to door ki baat hai. If it wasn't for American/British oil companies these arabs would still be fucking goats for their entertainment. And yes tel arbon ka hai muslamano ka nahi
5866 2018-09-08 17:45:58 Mr Vega it's not a coup, it's the restoration of a Republic sequestered by thugs whose only aim is to destroy the United States, bow down to the socialist agenda! Via drugs, money laundering, the left wants to keep the coffers (oil, Coltan, uranium) for them
5867 2018-09-08 17:45:57 Hoping that vaping CBD oil with my Prozac is gonna mellow me tf out

5872 2018-09-08 17:45:31 The worst part about living on your own is now I have to pay for oil changes because I have no way of doing it myself
5873 2018-09-08 17:45:21 In 1983, Oscar Torres Pancardo, secretary general of the union of oil workers, dies in a car accident, which his family believed to be premeditated.
5874 2018-09-08 17:45:12 I will regret it Sharon because I want Scottish Independence, this country would thrive away from Westminster, even one of your own ex chancellors Denis Healy who use to be my MP at Leeds east said they were very worried over losing the revenue from oil hence the lies to keep us

5877 2018-09-08 17:44:56 the real secret is a gardlic crush. Never mind browning in oil, blah blah. Cook whatever you are cooking and then when you're five minutes from the end, crush the garlic in. One clove just might do it for you! Better for you too.
5878 2018-09-08 17:44:49 More than half the population under blackout..capitol ...no water, no gas...no bread ....yet the economy is growing.....humans have no productive value....just consumption.....Libya doesn't need the Libyans ....there is oil
5879 2018-09-08 17:44:33 We may be deplorable,
But we're not as stupid as the Democrats swallowing Obama snake oil.
5880 2018-09-08 17:44:22 @DoctorChristian hi Dr just a quickly , sever anxiety with crippling symptoms however also a hgv driver so limited on the meds , CBD oil ???? Your thoughts ???
5881 2018-09-08 17:44:11 Why are they always sweating? Or do they put oil on their face before?

5883 2018-09-08 17:44:01 If Washington succeeds on November 4 in cutting all #Iran oil exports, world (dollar) oil prices could soar above 100 dollars, adding dramatically to the developing world dollar #shortage. This is war by other means./$ as a “silent weapon” for not so quiet wars.

5891 2018-09-08 17:43:16 got my oil changed on time. WOW.
5892 2018-09-08 17:43:15 Was buying oil for my car and the man behind me tell me i look like  one of them independent women who dont need no man and thas why i here buyin oil myself. 

How is this even a mentality??
5893 2018-09-08 17:43:04 Booty rubs with baby oil gel is the best. I Want one of those.
5894 2018-09-08 17:42:57 Been up for 28 hours and counting, worked 12 hours, went to get my oil changed and was insulted the entire time while waiting for my car by a man also waiting for his vehicle. Could be worse though, right?
5895 2018-09-08 17:42:52 True that. Oil is refined fat
5896 2018-09-08 17:42:47 Worthhhh. Itu extraordinary oil enak parah baunya
5897 2018-09-08 17:42:46 My car got all my money this week  from the car note , tires oil change and breaks .
5898 2018-09-08 17:42:46 Oil bond and payment to Iran are different IMO.. will you ever accept the ineptitude rule for 10 years.
5899 2018-09-08 17:42:44 Gas and oil rages  with dry kindling collected at base.  Just need a spark or match.  Commercials have knowledge of Feds direction in late 2018?   There needs to be a narrative to fit the liftoff.
5900 2018-09-08 17:42:36 @BarackObama 's silence has been so great. Listen to him talk of you haven't.  He's a great snake oil salesman.  Behind the flowery language his platform is that the government will run your life better than you can.  That's the fundamental difference between parties.
5901 2018-09-08 17:42:29 #Iran has a valid concern, the USA in the 1950s invaded the nation with the CIA, and killed their legislature, president, and key people like university professors to install the SHAH. It was done totally to steal the oil from IRAN.
5902 2018-09-08 17:42:18 For me it's like honestly I don't need as much oil or salt as you're telling me to add. (I have high blood pressure so I'm more cautious) (the main exception is potatoes always need more salt)
5903 2018-09-08 17:42:12 The Chinese will Pay $4 per TON and resell for $45  just like the French  with African OIL under LE FLOCH PRIGENT  who was laughing and bragging  about it. PS I don't know about the price of COAL but what I say about the  price of Oil is REAL. The Chinese are also laughing.
5904 2018-09-08 17:42:05 @HealthyHomeEcon Hi Sarah.  I'm reading so much conflicting information on hemp seeds.  Is the high omega 6 to omega 3 ratio actually inflammatory?  Or is that just problematic with hemp seed oil? Thank you!
5905 2018-09-08 17:41:55 Whoever gave me that spiked drink, I hope you rot in hell. Desperate scums like you should be drowned in boiling oil.
5906 2018-09-08 17:41:42 The Conservatives might have had a balanced budget in 2013-4 but they played around so that they could reserve it for 2014-5 and then oil prices screwed those plans, hence the selling of GM shares.
5907 2018-09-08 17:41:33 Guy:apply Oliver oil and try again 

ATM:jesu oya collect your squirt cash

5909 2018-09-08 17:41:10 oil pan, youre done. oh im about to take a sloppy sloppy oil shower
5910 2018-09-08 17:41:10 It may affect the level of production in the short term.  I mean, business is reactionary.  But, at the end of the day, if there's money to be made, they'll be here to make it.  Oil is not holy water, it's a potential source of revenue.  Full stop!
5911 2018-09-08 17:41:09 Light mousse, I use creme of nature argan oil style & shine mousse x
5912 2018-09-08 17:40:58 FINALLY getting an oil change today. I haven't hit my personal record of 1500 miles over the recommended mileage, but I was getting there.
5913 2018-09-08 17:40:41 We use hand pressed seasame oil and groundnut oil for cooking
5914 2018-09-08 17:40:27 Stripping sulphur from oil (or gas) isn’t difficult. They’ll get more efficient. The worse part is that refining groups will pay more to do this, & pass costs onto the consumer to recoup overall. That means you & I will be paying even higher prices at the pump in 2020.
5915 2018-09-08 17:40:11 ああ、これはまずい。実にまずい。0.1トン超えたよ。

5918 2018-09-08 17:39:49 In theory, yes. I’m talking about a national strategy, enshrined in to law, where 10% of every dollar earned from the sands is put in to a contingency fund for clean energy. The fund is 100% paid for by the oil/gas industry, from their revenues, for the benefit of Canadians.

5920 2018-09-08 17:39:45 If Trump were still following your economic plan, I might give you some credit, but he has erased your plan and implemented his own. Tax cuts for corporations and citizens, removal of your stifling regulations, beat Saudi Arabia to be the world's largest exporter of crude and oil

5922 2018-09-08 17:39:30 I agree with you, so time to tax the oil industry fairly.  We've never done so.  Conservative supporters are convinced that oil companies will walk away from us if they are taxed fairly.  That's laughable.
5923 2018-09-08 17:39:26 Thank you, Governor Brown.
We will NOT let the greedy oil barons drill off of our pristine coasts!

5932 2018-09-08 17:37:55 if I made an overeating vid that was me vs a loaf of bread and olive oil... Would my stuffing fans be into it?
5933 2018-09-08 17:37:53 Honestly, I don't understand all the hubbub. The man has his own website and a fuckton of followers. Invest some of that Snake Oil Supplement money into a server farm if you can't handle the traffic. The internet as a whole owes you nothing.
5934 2018-09-08 17:37:44 Huhu give niyo me ng @doterra essential oil Merry Christmas thanks thanks
5935 2018-09-08 17:37:41 Kavanaugh = if your husband's boss embezzles your husband's retirement fund, you had better get used to eating cat food. It means if the oil industry wants the US military to invade another country, your son--and maybe even your daughter--will be drafted and sent off to die.
5936 2018-09-08 17:37:39 Happy happy birthday to you, let us both cover your hot gorgeous body in warm oil and massage you into ectasy
5937 2018-09-08 17:37:38 #BREAKING @MichaelKugelman Trump administration offhandedly debates backing a coup in unstable major oil exporter, decides it's too dumb even for them

RESPONSIBLE CENTRISTS: Wait let's hear this coup idea out 
5938 2018-09-08 17:37:35 I did butterfly it actually! Not even knowing it was a thing I just thought that would cook better.

I actually think what happened was the Olive oil mixed with the water on the chicken and that burnt on the chicken, causing the chicken to not actually get cooked enough.
5939 2018-09-08 17:37:34 Car or cooking oil?
5940 2018-09-08 17:37:23 ถามมาตอบได้อะ แต่ให้ถามก่อนก็ลำบากอยู่ มีปหกับการตั้งคำถาม55555555555555
5941 2018-09-08 17:37:18 Last year Saudia has created a world record for the production of Olive oil.......did you remember that to mention it here? Am I right!
5942 2018-09-08 17:37:16 i had it in my cup holder and he asked to see it he was like “is this thc??? we’ve been seeing these with thc oil in them” and i was like whaaaaat no way  he even pressed the button and started smelling it i almost started howling
5943 2018-09-08 17:37:01 And my point is that the oil that they have already found is more than we need or should burn.
5944 2018-09-08 17:37:00 Azzadi see aaj Tak desh me crude oil aur us per lagne Wala tax equal Raha hai

Keval 1989 me 2 mth aise the India me ki crude oil me tax 50 percent see Kam hua

Jin jagah vipaksh ki government hai wahan kyon nahi apna revenue Kam ker dete hai

Koi Kam nahi karega
5945 2018-09-08 17:36:56 No, stop believing this myth of the us taking oil out of countries we’ve invaded, we don’t do that. Also, Venezuela is under a tyrannical dictatorship, it’s people hate Maduro
5946 2018-09-08 17:36:54 This isn't really a north vs south battle as vast swathes of the south east of England are still licenced for oil drilling. And the battle at Leith Hill took a long ten years to win. Perhaps it would be better to look constructively at this situation, learn from each other? 1/2
5947 2018-09-08 17:36:50 That’s actually stealing someone’s resources if the US goes in and takes control of their oil. Plus the greed/corruptness in the US that would over see that oil is not a good thing either. These people don’t care if ppl die as long as they have more money in their bank accounts.
5948 2018-09-08 17:36:45 La dernière fois que j'ai mis les pieds à Bercy c'était pour un concert de Midnight Oil ou peut être Joe Cocker en fait, je ne sais plus si la chronologie est exacte.

5949 2018-09-08 17:36:43 I craft small batches for my family . I make it with healing love thoughts as I stir and mess with it . They absolutely notice the difference vs mass product oil . I add the love vibe . Water has memory So why not oil . I love this topic . MG @UncleTweezy sings to his plants
5950 2018-09-08 17:36:20 It is the international market price. It may be worthwhile to also add the price at which it is sold locally with local taxes added in most countries that don't produce oil. Else all this is false logic to excite the masses.
5951 2018-09-08 17:36:20 I feel like he wants better ads than just Mobil oil
5952 2018-09-08 17:35:58 Never heard of them until now.  Sounds like I should branch out from jalapeno and bell peppers, if I can find them here.  Do you coat them in oil?
5953 2018-09-08 17:35:49 If we can deviate away from selling oil to the States at a discounted price and get fair market value for it I believe it screws them bigly.  Just my opinion.
5954 2018-09-08 17:35:48 In the city, sliced bread with olive oil and za'tar is also very popular.
5955 2018-09-08 17:35:46 when cheeto was told he cannot use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve solely to bring down the price of gas, he is plotting to overthrow, via a coup, the government in Venezuela and prop it up with an american puppet government  in order to get his hands on its oil to drop gas price

5961 2018-09-08 17:34:42 The oil industry has a goal of reducing their employees to as close to zero as possible. The oil jobs are being phased our faster than we're phasing out oil. Given that reality it makes much more sense to focus on shifting our economy towards other jobs. Especially green tech.
5962 2018-09-08 17:34:39 I really lucked up with Garrett bc I got a man that changes my oil, filter, brakes, and rotates my tires.
5963 2018-09-08 17:34:33 Sorry sweetheart, but that part is true. Oil provides money for all of Canada. Our GDP would be greatly affected if oil were removed tomorrow. But we have more than oil. Wood, coal, minerals, water. We are a veritable grocery store of natural resources.
5964 2018-09-08 17:34:09 It not just the price of oil...but our savings now to serve the debt. 
The national debt now is $73 billion 
Our foreign reserves saving now is $ 47 billion at GDP of 21%. This is an impressive profile even recognized by Forbes as the best economy In Africa 2018.

5969 2018-09-08 17:33:26 personally I believe that the high price of oil in the past masked the the inefficiency and mismanagement at the company.

5976 2018-09-08 17:32:21 USSR? I did not know the USA  have set up an embargo in the 60s, because the USSR denied him the exploitation of its oil wealth. The world is changing, the stick is so long that it bypasses the Venezuelan government. What does not change is that it always strikes the people.
5977 2018-09-08 17:32:07 @MichaelsCoDub hey, belated congratulations on your review in the Times, can't wait to eat your food. (With a nice glass of chilled olive oil.)

5980 2018-09-08 17:31:44 cheeto is only interested in Venezuelan oil to get price of gasoline in US down so he can show the ignorant "he brought and kept gas prices low"
5981 2018-09-08 17:31:39 Never really explained to electorate why Norway voted for EEA...protect oil revenues from paying their dues....we really haven’t got that problem.
5982 2018-09-08 17:31:30 @BJP4India has just put up a Hinduist mask giving a step child treatment to #Hindus #Hinduist organisations.
It's a development oriented Govt developing Oil Prices, Roads full of pits & Unemployment across.
5983 2018-09-08 17:31:14 Venezuela is a perfect target for American cowardly military. They have oil, they have no army, the economy is in chaos and the people are starving. Our troops have a chance to not look like losers if we attack them. I would still bet that we lose though, crashing into each other
5984 2018-09-08 17:31:10 Ray just took my car to get an oil change. This man knows how much I truly HATE dealing with car shit. Even if it’s scheduled maintenance. Blame it on the trauma of being left on the side of the road too many times 
5985 2018-09-08 17:31:02 Here US goes again, regime change in oil producing country. Billions of US taxpayer $ to "meddle" in another country for benefit of US oil & US military Industrial Complex
5986 2018-09-08 17:30:58 เออองั้นก็ติดตมด้วยกัน555555
5987 2018-09-08 17:30:57 ...rely on oil production to feed their families.  I'm not proud to be in the oilfield but I am proud that my family doesn't go without.  If I could support my family in a more socially conscious way I would do it now.
5988 2018-09-08 17:30:53 Google prices of oil from 2013 to 2018 also,Google when oil was sold for 150 usd. Thanks
5989 2018-09-08 17:30:51 Obama tax cuts? Not. Obama deregulation? Not. Obama coal, steel, oil, auto jobs? Not. Obama gave more to Iran than the American worker.
5990 2018-09-08 17:30:43 Not to be mean just honesty...if you lost your pussy to a hystetectomy...baby oil or no type of lubrication will help that man find your g-spot...it's gone!

5993 2018-09-08 17:30:24 ONI: OMFG. i just realized the dumbest thing. i've built some cooling rigs, where ya run cold-assed ph2o or oil through insulated pipes then strategically place radiant pipes to spot cool, right?
5994 2018-09-08 17:30:24 Lmao, I’m a few days behind for my oil change
5995 2018-09-08 17:30:24 Pick up some heat w/ Orgrow oil which is serving up Pineapple, Strawberry Diesel, Space Tangie , Plushberry, Super Silver Haze
5996 2018-09-08 17:30:22 That's a false economy. Once dollars stop circulating - it will come crashing down.  
I'm old and have done a lot of diff jobs in my lifetime - research out of  UCSF, oil company,  economic background. If he has a 401K & can move it to  a more secure place in his 401 he should.
5997 2018-09-08 17:30:17 If you buy crude oil as debt, then crude oil price doesn't matter. Congress bought crude from 1.3 lakh crore oil bond. Bjp has paid it with interest.

6004 2018-09-08 17:29:22 No. JC never was never over his limits ( Watts and W/kg), even 2012, and over what I call " Human Limits". Nibali yes ! Specially when he flies. Valverde is almost like when he beated Lance, Rasmussen, Basso all fueled oil at @LeTour Courchevel 2005. JC Never changed his blood.

6010 2018-09-08 17:28:36 So pipeline construction is helping us pay our bills and keeping our employees employed. For all of you dumb ass people that are against pipelines give your heads a shake. Do you think this economy runs on fairy dust and unicorn darts. This is Saskatchewan we need oil.

6029 2018-09-08 17:25:35 I had my first spill this week on my Vespa in my garage at 5mph (damn you oil spill!) and was very happy to be wearing my full gear. Got away with some sock burn and a bruised knee.
6030 2018-09-08 17:25:31 @akuawood Does the marula oil really contain vitamin c? ive read that vitamin c is only water soluble. the fruit contains vitamin c but does the seed oil aswell?

6044 2018-09-08 17:24:05 No one criticizes Israel more than the Israelis themselves. This is not about that. This is about demonizing. Look through his personal timeline and tell me in all honesty he just want to "criticize Israel" and I'll have some snake oil to sell you.

6048 2018-09-08 17:23:33 Just one question
Who do you prefer to have that power (oil power)? Terrorist / drugs / communist cartels as Venezuelan government or the US government?
As Venezuelan, I'll take the second choice
6049 2018-09-08 17:23:22 Always about greed & cheap oil.
Just like the 1953 coup the US & Great Britain staged in Iran.
Installed their brutal tyrant puppet Shah & he gave them their cheap oil.
6050 2018-09-08 17:23:07 Where can i get some real tea tree oil or some aloe?

6052 2018-09-08 17:22:58 Yea. The preshave oil and shaving cream are fantastic together. Went with bergamot to start with. Hoping to see a #fendrihan aftershave soon.
6053 2018-09-08 17:22:58 More worryingly, I don’t want this to detract from your excellent Brexit work. The proposed reforms are a ‘simple’ solution to a complex problem - much like the snake oil that Brexiters are  peddling. The reality in both cases is that simple solutions don’t work.

6055 2018-09-08 17:22:52 We already knew that would happen. Sometimes I just wished we had oil money to spend, but in the other hand I’m really proud to support a football team that has built a team the @FootballManager way. Brick by brick. #without #cheatcodes #proud !

6058 2018-09-08 17:22:32 My grandparents were eggs & bacon people.  They lived a healthy life & died in their 90s & 100s.  My parents were soft drink, juice, veg oil & oatmeal people.  They lived sick the last 20 yrs of their lives and died in their 70s & 80s.
6059 2018-09-08 17:22:29 That goes back at least to Kissinger's 1976 Doha agreement with the Sauds -- we prop up the Sauds in exchange for them selling oil in dollars at moderate prices.
6060 2018-09-08 17:22:26 We don't have many oil rigs that we pretend to have we do it to keep the oil prices low

6062 2018-09-08 17:22:13 Hi there, there should be instructions on our bacon. To Shallow Fry heat 1 tsp of oil in a frying pan. Add the bacon and cook over a medium heat for 5-6 minutes, turning occasionally. 1/5
6063 2018-09-08 17:22:03 ^There is no of tila or its oil in the RV only ghR^ita. However, tila was used in the Harappan civilization from even before the mature phase & is native to India. OTH as above it is mentioned in some YV texts& widely used as offering in rituals after that point. This suggests
6064 2018-09-08 17:21:57 True be we have water lots of it and oil.  While he was bashing us the other night I read that the #1 Canadian import to Montana is energy.

6066 2018-09-08 17:21:52 Oil companies and climate change threaten lives. Why can't these workers evolve like the rest of the world? You are supposed to work for the best interest of the people of La., not oil companies. It's time to move on from the 1900s.
6067 2018-09-08 17:21:50 can’t sleep. 1 a.m. snack: toasted olive bread dipped in olive oil and sherry vinegar. YUM
6068 2018-09-08 17:21:44 The 1953 coup the US & Great Britain staged in Iran was the first covert coup during peacetime. 
All for fucking cheap oil.
So the situation in Iran today is DIRECTLY the fault of the US’s greedy meddling.
6069 2018-09-08 17:21:23 Make us greater by getting the price of oil and gas down to a reasonable $. It will help our economy even MORE!
6070 2018-09-08 17:21:22 Not clean energy. Cleaner heavy crude oil, which we'll need until transportation is electrified in X decades.
6071 2018-09-08 17:21:19 try raw black soap for face wash!!! i recently started using it cuz i have hormonal acne too & its suuuper helpful! witch hazel for toner, raw black soap to cleanse, and tea tree oil spot treatment
6072 2018-09-08 17:21:02 It has the worlds largest oil reserves, more then Saudi Arabia.
6073 2018-09-08 17:21:00 1) Inefficient use of funds
2) Kickbacks in defense procurement
3) Kickbacks while Army officers manage other state institutions (WAPDA, Pakistan Railways, etc.)
4) Smuggling of cash, narcotics, cars & oil
6074 2018-09-08 17:20:48 I’ve tried it but the oil makes me break out :(
6075 2018-09-08 17:20:48 He is so cool! Taking all those venture (vulture) capitalists for a ride, doing his own thing, giving the middle finger to big oil. Love it.
6076 2018-09-08 17:20:43 Claro. Igual a da sua mãe com o Negão da piroca.
6077 2018-09-08 17:20:35 When you get there buy some Jasmine oil too.
6078 2018-09-08 17:20:20 I drive a Mercedes lol a $40 oil change isn’t it unfortunately.
6079 2018-09-08 17:19:58 The pipeline only makes sense if oil sands expands production. The pipeline only makes sense if we can get $80 per barrel of dilbit. The shipping cost/tanker size disadvantage we have is massive.
New sulphur rules are going to add costs to our production or bigger discounts

6084 2018-09-08 17:19:26 Russia mostly exports oil, gas, minerals and grain, while importing vast amounts of consumer goods and equipment. There's a term for such an economy: third world. #RussianEconomy
6085 2018-09-08 17:19:22 I'd love to hear more on how oil and gas will give us clean energy.
6086 2018-09-08 17:19:22 100 though lol for an oil change? I’ve never seen anybody pay more than 40
6087 2018-09-08 17:19:07 Weak goal on poorly defended PK in KHL doesn't mean didn't get enough Oil chance or that 30 other NHL GMs dumb.  Weak goal on a specific KHL goalie doesn't mean another specifically scouted KHL goalie is crap.

6091 2018-09-08 17:18:36 something going to happen. Hopefully Venezuela does go into a total breakdown. An turns into another Syria, Libya. But US was planning in taking over Oil Countries one after the next. Syria is holding out.
6092 2018-09-08 17:18:26 @muglikar_ 5/7 No loan - No oil bonds on our childrens’ head. UPA left Oil bonds (loan+interest) Rs.2 lakhs crores, despite 11.6% p.a. increase in price. – much higher than the 2.34%, now prevalent.
6093 2018-09-08 17:18:25 True, but this action, imo, advances the cause while selling crap. Better than using kap to hawk snake oil ...
6094 2018-09-08 17:18:16 Coconut oil is your friend, and MCT is also if you dont have an adverse reaction. Also keep an eye on your protein intake, that shot me in the foot for a while.
6095 2018-09-08 17:18:07 Thankfully oil is not the be all and end all of the Scottish economy.
6096 2018-09-08 17:17:33 Less need for gas & oil. More money for education,health care. Better relations with the world community. What's not to like? Think Congress could have figured it out. And the Democrats-they are the war party
6097 2018-09-08 17:17:28 You forgot IRAN. 
In 1953, the US & co. staged a coup & replaced the democratically-elected & beloved Prime Minister with the brutal, murderous dictator Shah. 
All for cheap oil. 

6098 2018-09-08 17:17:28 Just cannot vote for a party who sells its nation down the river and has Westminster as its puppeteers, Scotland’s wealth via the macrone report kept hidden by your party and the tories, don’t tell me they want to continue bank rolling London with our asset oil

6101 2018-09-08 17:16:22 I'm with you that we need to get away from O&G, I think we just don't see eye to eye on the timelines.  I'm not necessarily interested in expanding the oil sands though, I'm with you on that.  It's tough, money talks at the end of the day.
6102 2018-09-08 17:16:14 Obama was trying to minimize our dependence on oil... Saudi Arabia and Russia economies are dependent on oil revenues... who is the biggest market for oil? Oh America... your perspective... we’ll extract higher prices from the Americans!! Hmmm...and President Xi Ping goes Solar!?

6105 2018-09-08 17:15:45 #Palmoil giant @Indofood’s illegal abuse is well documented. @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s business partner uses child labour & has intimidated communities from their homes to make way for palm oil plantations. RT to pressure @RSPOtweets to stop certifying exploitation Indofood

6107 2018-09-08 17:15:42 Debt status. This forces the governments to sit up or face backlash from their citizens. This is accountability. The only conditions China loans are predicated on, are that we have a collateral e.g crude oil, ports to payback with
6108 2018-09-08 17:15:36 Until oil price crashes. You speak like you don't know that the price of crude is fickle and there's the possibility that we could run out of crude and there are alternatives to fossil fuels.
6109 2018-09-08 17:15:26 you're glad trump is president because you think it makes you relevant again and you don't have to shill snake oil anymore. Enjoy your 15 minute ride on the #TrumpTrain.

6111 2018-09-08 17:15:18 Michael. I read your updated “stands” on issues: Interesting. Agree with some. Environment: Stop making Anything of Styrofoam & Walmart bags etc. Energy: Remove Middle East from our Equation. Set our Oil price @ $75.00 per barrell. Oil companies lose $$$ below &40.00.

6125 2018-09-08 17:13:57 Your priorities should be with a pipeline to both coasts to end the American monopoly on Canadian Oil

6128 2018-09-08 17:13:50 It's only a problem when a president is self-serving.... i.e Both Clinton (furthering political career for himself & wife while getting richer from it), Bush's (richer from primarily big oil), Obama (net worth increased 33m while in office for 8 years).
6129 2018-09-08 17:13:43 ‘WHOA...CHECK THIS OUT’ is never good to hear coming from the oil change bay pit that your vehicle is parked over...

6131 2018-09-08 17:13:28 Yikes, #palmoil regulator @RSPOtweets is greenwashing @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s business partner @Indofood. RT to tell the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil to punish Indofood for dealing in exploitation palm oil!
6132 2018-09-08 17:13:03 Can someone help me check my oil?
6133 2018-09-08 17:12:59 I have some at home but I dare not go near it or else I'll end up eating just rice and chilli oil.
6134 2018-09-08 17:12:52 I agree with toppling maduro his people are fleeing the country in mass If we don’t stabilize the region a worse refugee crisis will spread across all nations in the americas. Venezuela sits on an oil gold mine and once was one of the richest country. Make Venezuela great again.
6135 2018-09-08 17:12:43 It's about work and wealth. In Alberta (and Sask) oil is work. Some of the best paying jobs in the Prairies are in this sector. Nobody wants to be the "put you out of work" party. We can't all farm wheat. 

(That's how I see the politics of it anyway.)
6136 2018-09-08 17:12:32 2] Obama promoted the interests of America's sworn enemies:  Russian Oligarchs (Uranium One), Islamic Terrorists (nuclear-enabled Iran, knowingly created ISIS by vacating Iraq), destroyed Gulf Oil and energy, tripled US debt, etc ...

Everything Obama did hurt US & helped enemies
6137 2018-09-08 17:12:22 Sir, I understand that we need to a line open with Nepal due to China. But with communist in rule now why waste our resources. Anyway we will be surrounded by enemies and also the internal cancer. By diverting the oil to India won't it reduce the price due to higher stock?
6138 2018-09-08 17:12:02 It‘s the oil.

6145 2018-09-08 17:11:26 Iraq was supposedly LIBERATED by west in 2003 and still 15 years later it's a hell hole,the only thing working there is oil exporting. prior to the LIBERATION,Iraq was in better situation. world is a better place without US POLICING. Instead of spending millions out,fix urself
6146 2018-09-08 17:11:20 Poor kids! Give them my sympathy. And I take it “snake oil” and “slimy salesman” are compliments? It reaffirms this mage of Trump supporters, clueless hypocrites with a complete lack of self awareness. Enjoy your day!

6151 2018-09-08 17:10:48 I can't do the butter thing. But I do the coconut oil every morning. I have tired to removed the heavy cream, but I just can't. Now I'm adding in intermediate fasting to help with me lose my last 20 lbs. Once I get this off, in all over 10 years I lost 100 lbs..

6153 2018-09-08 17:10:30 Hash oil, honey oil, wax, and all the rest aren't extractions of cannabis, they're concentrates. An extraction is one chemical extracted from the total mix of chemicals found in cannabis.
6154 2018-09-08 17:10:30 I suppose for the same reason we hear about the Holocaust ad nauseam but very little about other ethnic cleansing  in places like Nanking, Burma, Rwanda and Armenia, the squeaky wheel gets the oil.
6155 2018-09-08 17:10:28 Don’t listen to Tucker Carlson! — you know what kind of bilge water spills from his mouth. Giving him your time, attention, & emotional energy is like having a bowl of castor oil for breakfast, lunch, & dinner.  Why would you do that to yourself?

1) They have 99 year lease on port in Sri Lanka
2) They signed contract with Djibouti to open military base.
3) They’re building hydropower station in Zambia with own money and bought stake in ZNBC
4) China took over no oil fields in Venezuela.

6181 2018-09-08 17:07:42 Listen Tucker Carlson/white supremacists who can't understand the value of diversity: 

White American food = bland chain restaurants and processed crap. Even American cheese is made from vegetable oil. Enjoy your  fake cheese and stfu idiots.

6186 2018-09-08 17:06:54 I'm not asking you to buy anything, I simply gave you a fact. The snake oil Corbyn offers would bring the country to its knees because it ISN'T new.

The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different outcome.
6187 2018-09-08 17:06:44 If Canadian jobs are so important that we need to burn tar sands and exacerbate #ClimateChange, why would @RachelNotley and @JustinTrudeau want to ship the oil to China?

Why not refine and burn here?

Because it's only to enrich Big Oil in the short term.

6194 2018-09-08 17:05:55 Gov. Brown signs bills to block Trump administration from allowing more oil drilling off the coast. “Today, California’s message to the Trump administration is simple: Not here, not now. We will not let the federal government pillage public lands and destroy our treasured coast.”
6195 2018-09-08 17:05:43 I pulled out all my furniture in my bedroom, edged the walls, and sprayed lavendar oil and water all along the walls and in the corners. Hope it works. I love the smell of lavendar though, it is so calming! The living room is next.
6196 2018-09-08 17:05:36 Don't worry, there's plenty of oil to keep this going.
6197 2018-09-08 17:05:28 WTF are you talking about? Did you even read the column? You conquered the issue of Trudeau pulling out every ridiculous agenda possible to screw the oil business and g0has now resorted to pulling out gender issues? You conquered that?
6198 2018-09-08 17:05:27 Harper was an economic mess, could u imagine how much worse he would have been without the benefits of high oil prices ?!?!?!

6200 2018-09-08 17:05:16 How about AI for scanning specific sea creatures for locations near oil traffic with automatic communication to open/close gates or warn vessels to re-route. We need better eyes, ears, and limbs fun robotic ones that directly connect with the brain. Radar scanners for the blind.
6201 2018-09-08 17:05:03 Did u dig that well for them to store Oil? Entire judiciary system is with Modi. Ask Modi to investigate and put Congress behind bars! Spineless bhakt.

6207 2018-09-08 17:04:42 *One of the ninja turtles gets some oil for the tin man before they all join in a circle around the giant snowman and start square-dancing to Hannah Montana's "Hoedown Throwdown".*

Sorry to hear u r hooking up with that snake oil salesman, Ro. Like minds ...
6211 2018-09-08 17:04:22 Let the Iranians sort out their own country. They tried in 1950’s then FUKUS and the oil corporations kicked out their democratically elected government. Installed the Shar. Who gave all the oil and profits to the west. Then France brought back Khomeini to set up Sunni/shite wars
6212 2018-09-08 17:04:13 Refining charges are around 12$ & crude $77 & transportation $6 so without taxes refined crude will be around $95. So 95 × 70/200 (refined oil litre in a barrel of crude)
6213 2018-09-08 17:04:07 Came for an oil change now I got nails in my tire. 
6214 2018-09-08 17:04:03 Job growth is not a great metric in a province that relies on resource development, Alberta has had a lot of growth over last couple years in pub sector, and jobs in oil,gas and mining are at way lower levels than before recession.What's happening now in industry is consolidation
6215 2018-09-08 17:03:52 I feel like when "your side" has produced a bunch of dirty screaming harpies who wore FLIP FLOPS TO THE CAPITAL TO PROTEST OH MY LAWD THAT IS NOT OKAY EW, you don't get to have the intellectual or moral high horse...

6221 2018-09-08 17:03:13 That's why your economy collapsed when oil dropped. That's why u were crying for help. Of course u have to count indirect jobs as part of it. But those indirect jobs wouldnt b there if it wasn't for the oil industry. How much manufacturing is there in Alberta?
6222 2018-09-08 17:03:09 Land? Try Oil.
6223 2018-09-08 17:03:02 Security is critical in view of the recent oil discovery and ensuing land disputes which could trigger widespread conflict, and the recent devolution of development and administrative functions to counties in Kenya.

6243 2018-09-08 17:00:32 Vi hace poco unas gráficas de un blog sobre el peak oil y para 2020 ponía que Venezuela no daba un barril.
6244 2018-09-08 17:00:28 Not really, oil prices collapsed about the time of the election with a sharp reduction in revenue.
6245 2018-09-08 17:00:26 Jaise oil and gas bhi bikas ke raste par tezi se aage badh raha hai 
6246 2018-09-08 17:00:25 Us time crude oil 140 USD per barrel tha ab 40 USD per barrel hai sir ji
6247 2018-09-08 17:00:24 おーまだ起きてたのかー作業か？無理するなよ？
6248 2018-09-08 17:00:22 Best meal plan -if anyone doesn't know where to start: Big bowl of Green Salads with 1 piece of grass fed meat and some coconut oil or ghee.
6249 2018-09-08 17:00:21 For the oil...right!?
6250 2018-09-08 17:00:21 Best meal plan -if anyone doesn't know where to start: Big bowl of Green Salads with 1 piece of grass fed meat and some coconut oil or ghee.
6251 2018-09-08 17:00:11 Never feel cooler than wearing my rain coat that has car grease/oil stains on it from my first car. Miss that Lil guy
6252 2018-09-08 17:00:04 Doesn’t it start with all the politicians in Washington getting paid by Big Oil? What can the little guy really do? I doubt my choice to drive an electric car is going to change much. Especially when alternatives to using fossil fuels aren’t economical.
6253 2018-09-08 17:00:03 Google how much electricity and water is required to make gas out of crude oil. I know u won't believe a word I say so go look for yourself, will only take few minutes.
6254 2018-09-08 17:00:01 Today is #InternationalLiteracyDay. Thanks to oil and gas and the vital funding it provides to public schools in New Mexico, we’re working every day to make our schools better and give our children the education they deserve.
6255 2018-09-08 16:59:53 I HATE getting my car serviced cause  I always get undermined of the knowledge I know about my car. Bruh asked me three fucking times if I knew my car took special oil. And I’ve said yes every time. I fucking know it’s a special oil & it’s more expensive 
6256 2018-09-08 16:59:44 もふもふするー
6257 2018-09-08 16:59:40 Or, you could leave it alone and let the private sector work it out. Besides the fact that you'll never get rid of oil, it's used in the production of too many things, fro. Plastics to medications. Perhaps you'd be happier living among the Amish Bernie.
6258 2018-09-08 16:59:40 Oil is on its way out, anyway/or the planet cooks. Soon, that blackmail tool will be useless&the blackmailers will have to drink it, wrecking their economies&...oh shit, more "refugees".
6259 2018-09-08 16:59:36 わたしはもうだめだ。。。
6260 2018-09-08 16:59:25 What does he deserve? Anointing oil or accolades? 
6261 2018-09-08 16:59:21 Or, ya know, MARRY.
6262 2018-09-08 16:59:09 I use honey and coconut oil a lot lol
6263 2018-09-08 16:59:06 Everything is made with oil.
6264 2018-09-08 16:59:05 It is 2018 and you condone working parents struggling to feed their families! You and the Tories are the problem. You need more than fruit & veg to feed a family . Meat,Fish,spices,sauces,cereals,bread,milk,marg,oil,loo roll,toiletries,cleaning products,washing powder,coffee,etc
6265 2018-09-08 16:59:01 i'd use it as an essential oil
6266 2018-09-08 16:58:59 #GratitudeForTheDay: The man in Sylva, NC, who helped me add oil to my car’s engine. Hubby was coaching me through it over the phone, but the cap was on so tight the guy had to get a wrench out of the toolbox to get it off. Southern men in trucks to the rescue. #SylvaNC
6267 2018-09-08 16:58:56 So every single microwave popcorn uses PALM OIL NOW? What the fuck?
6268 2018-09-08 16:58:54 I peep that you can buy cbd oil pills and extract now at the pharmacy in shop n save that's what's up
6269 2018-09-08 16:58:53 Thank u Sir..Yes sir I did not go into the oil bond payment and the US sanctions against Iran coz that would make the thread quite long..might add it later though..
6270 2018-09-08 16:58:46 Ε, τοτε bio oil που κανει για ολα

6275 2018-09-08 16:58:10 Everything is made with oil.
6276 2018-09-08 16:58:05 @JimCarrey I’m curious? When has the government ever subsidized any oil company? Ever? You don’t know what your talking about
6277 2018-09-08 16:57:59 We bought it at 24k. It's had a set of tyres, an exhaust, a steering rack gaiter and a couple of services (takes 2.5 litres of oil!). Biggest issue has been a seized wiper spindle, but I managed to free it off.
6278 2018-09-08 16:57:50 Waiting for my car xD oil change!!
6279 2018-09-08 16:57:44 Bummer to miss those first 3 TDs vs Western Michigan. Shame on me for taking too long getting an oil change today #GoBlue
6280 2018-09-08 16:57:36 This snake oil salesman is digging for his gold - what a con man
6281 2018-09-08 16:57:31 I missed my window to get my oil changed today, so instead, I aim to complete two projects. One down, time to start the other. Maybe after all these months, I can bring it to a close.

6284 2018-09-08 16:57:02 Thank you!  I’ve got a salt lamp which I love! And I’ve just got an oil diffuser/colour changing lamp too. And I’ve been taking lavender oil for a few months which is amazing! But ideally I would just migrate to a different country. 
6285 2018-09-08 16:56:50 We shall see 
Its easy to be bold when you’re handed sweet heart deal by the goverment & funded by tax payers. Battery powered cars was figured out in the 1910s ;). Oil/politics got in the way. When SpaceX got into trouble they called? NASA. Orig assertion stands. He’s a dirt bag
6286 2018-09-08 16:56:49 Looks like YOU missed OUT on the Oil Bonds repayment floated by UPA.
Great Read,thanx.
6287 2018-09-08 16:56:44 Canola and the cooking oil for "cardiac health" actually is bad for heart muscles.
6288 2018-09-08 16:56:43 If govt doesn’t provide jobs, failed to control oil prices then whatever they do, people will vote out them. Also Farmers are not happy.
6289 2018-09-08 16:56:42 We discovered oil, we export it then import the same at a higher cost. Next thing MPs will demand Fueling allowances to be increased
6290 2018-09-08 16:56:24 What salesman you know gets out in the shop and changes his customers oil because we’re low staffed? I’m in it to make my customers happy anyway i can 
6291 2018-09-08 16:56:12 And when the price of oil makes the tar sand lucrative again you will stop whining about Ottawa and whine about the east coasters working for a lower wage. Google the word diversification and figure it out!
6292 2018-09-08 16:56:08 Yup. I'm writing a book about Alberta energy issues and policies, and the impact of data and software is mentioned by every expert I interviewed. We're at the beginning of a revolution in the oil and gas sector.
6293 2018-09-08 16:56:05 You know, Sanders... you're like a snake oil salesman. You make everything sound so easy, rosy & nice... but it doesn't hold up in reality
6294 2018-09-08 16:56:02 I should definitely get my oil changed while I’m at work ..
6295 2018-09-08 16:55:57 Sir look for oil implement for GST
6296 2018-09-08 16:55:57 @HarryKewell hope you get shagged up arse oil tneet... dry n all cunt
6297 2018-09-08 16:55:45 My point is: we as a species were able to fish tens of thousands of years without producing the negative effects (ghostnets, oil spills, wasteful harvesting) we see now from fishing. The problem isn't eating fish, it again is the way we currently do it.
6298 2018-09-08 16:55:45 Ahhhh the smell of oil, rubber and pumpkin spice.

It screams Fall.
6299 2018-09-08 16:55:42 sunil ji kuch bhi kaho is oil pricing ko control naa kiya to aag lgaa degi.
6300 2018-09-08 16:55:33 @FWhitfield @cnnbrk are you serious about Venezuela? Your reporting is so bush-league! Really sub-par! You talk about a U.S. coup but omit the one and only reason for this! OIL! Not political or humanitarian just corporate greed! You end with: “we’ll see if there’s a coalition..”
6301 2018-09-08 16:55:16 Phillip Island 2001 (if memory serves me right) pissing down rain race that made Silverstone (a couple weeks ago) look like a cake walk  and Steve Martin layed oil down the front straight  (I won it btw ) 
6302 2018-09-08 16:55:15 I use coconut oil in my coffee and heavy cream..
6303 2018-09-08 16:55:11 A bib wouldn’t have helped! Haha I tipped the entire plate directly into my lap, red, chorizo oil....everywhere! 
6304 2018-09-08 16:55:00 This is another aspect of the caudillo model, where the fate of the poor is seen as the burden of a self-appointed savior, especially in a country dependent on imported food and oil exports.
6305 2018-09-08 16:54:54 Thanks Z.  My focus here is natural gas , not oil. European prices are also under the spotlight.
6306 2018-09-08 16:54:53 I’ll try
6307 2018-09-08 16:54:09 I gotta go get an oil change
6308 2018-09-08 16:53:58 I use ONLY that oil or pure cow ghee for all cooking. Occasionally I use coconut oil for select recipes. But no other oils enter my lil kitchen that belongs to another century. 
6309 2018-09-08 16:53:57 Garnier yang kuning kak! Bagus di aku. Udh ada oil cleanser sekalian.
6310 2018-09-08 16:53:56 Join me and tell palm oil regulator @RSPOtweets to stop certifying rainforest-destroying company @Indofood now

6312 2018-09-08 16:53:49 Yes Dosa is exclusively cooked in sesame/gingelly oil in Kerala & we also make pickles using this.
6313 2018-09-08 16:53:41 Weed was illegal because it interfered with oil (Hemp) and alcohol and #BigPharma. But the plant's energy has a big hold on the human because we both contain cannabinoids. That's right folks you got em too.
6314 2018-09-08 16:53:41 At @JiffyLube to get an oil change. This place is absolutely insane. The good thing is that it is cool out and not steaming out like it has been for the past few days.
6315 2018-09-08 16:53:39 Gak boleh. Karena phyto itu essence dan fresh herb itu oil.
6316 2018-09-08 16:53:36 あああぁ
6317 2018-09-08 16:53:26 If anyone is coming to Greenville can someone bring me some lip oil. I lost mine last night

6319 2018-09-08 16:53:23 Of sexism or racism is just blaming the issue on something easy and not getting to the root of the problem. She lost because she pines to her donors and the rich, she’s sold out to big oil companies and insurance companies. She would have been better than Trump but a lot of
6320 2018-09-08 16:53:19 Is it just me, or am I the only 1 surprised with disbelief when it’s time to change air filters? "Could've sworn I just changed them!" It isn’t like oil filter where the odometer rolls over & reminds with the little sticker inyourface. Thanks @Filtrete for reminders! Seriously 
6321 2018-09-08 16:53:12 This wouldn't happen to have anything to do with oil now?  Hmmmm.
6322 2018-09-08 16:53:02 Agreed. Do you we blame it on the coconut oil?
6323 2018-09-08 16:52:56 He is nothing but a snake oil saleman. Obama succeeded in dividing and economically crippling America. Get your head our of the sand! @POTUS ACCOMPLISHED ALL OF THIS AND NOT OBAMA.
6324 2018-09-08 16:52:48 Car wouldn’t start, luckily a friend of mine decided to come so after an oil change here we come @FursonaCon!
6325 2018-09-08 16:52:48 Today has been about self care because i wanted to, not because i had to. Been watching Iron Fist, gave my hair a coconut oil treatment, had a 2 hour nap and now ima have a big salad for dinner.
6326 2018-09-08 16:52:41 And why stop at using our own oil? Why not everything else too. Our own food, cell phones, clothing, fruit, industrial machinery, etc. Let's just go back to cottage industries for every single item we consume? Oh, wait, that's just ridiculous isn't it.
6327 2018-09-08 16:52:35 go get that oil change boy
6328 2018-09-08 16:52:33 Top quality, i wonder if she needs any help with that baby oil?   
6329 2018-09-08 16:52:31 Yea for the ones I use at home I dry it off, oil it up, heat it up till the oil just starts to smoke. The ones I took camping I think I heated the oil up too much to where it was smoking off so the seasoning is a bit uneven.
6330 2018-09-08 16:52:27 The US is planning something. Yesterday they started “training” excercises in Syria near Russian airspace. NEVER done it before. This all comes down to oil. We need Russia and Iran out, because we don’t share well. Chemical weapons make sense, no damage.
6331 2018-09-08 16:52:25 Didn’t have to pay for this oil change or tire rotation so I guess this money is going to a festival.
6332 2018-09-08 16:52:24 Body shop eh apa face shop sih yg tea tree oil. Ada fash wash sama toner.
6333 2018-09-08 16:52:19 But she already opened up protected land to oil drilling. That's what she got for voting for the tax scam. She's not trustworthy, they should know that by now.
6334 2018-09-08 16:52:14 Not vegan myself but Garnier just advertised a new vegan hair oil for frizzy hair, it boasts no animal ingredients or by products BUT I very short search also shows that they test on animals! If you do have issues with frizzy hair, try @LushLtd range of hair products!
6335 2018-09-08 16:52:11 Given that it’s centrists that have brought us austerity, oil dependency, rampant climate change, inequality and several pointless wars....!!!!
Well, good luck with that!

6346 2018-09-08 16:51:09 Actually most “heavy oil” has a specific gravity (SG) of just below 1.0. And by its very definition dilbit must have a SG < 0.94, and water with a SG of 1.0 means that yes it will float.

6349 2018-09-08 16:50:56 One more thing about the Salem Giant Eagle:

It had a tiny selection of vegan butter, and what they did have was over $5 for a small tub

P.S. whoever thought of making butter with avocado oil should be shot into the fucking sun
6350 2018-09-08 16:50:52 I always oil mine right after I rinse it off after use...so it is ready for the next day or two.

6355 2018-09-08 16:50:23 Saying "Today, California’s message to the Trump administration is simple: Not here, not now,” @JerryBrownGov signed two bills -- SB 834 and AB 1775 -- aimed at blocking new federal oil drilling off the California coast.
6356 2018-09-08 16:50:06 Seems like you are tweeting under the influence of sharjil uncles memon olive oil again.
6357 2018-09-08 16:50:02 You need to change your oil sir hahaha

6359 2018-09-08 16:49:50 فهمیدن ابی از این ملت گرم نمیشه
6360 2018-09-08 16:49:46 Absolutely right.  A tiny minority is dictating the national agenda and has been doing so for years.  That tiny minority consists of oil company executives and industry associations.  They have turned this country into a petro state.  And that needs to stop.
6361 2018-09-08 16:49:38 U can’t support such an intervention no matter what . If u wanna help , let them sell their oil freely , stop the isolations but NO COUP!!
6362 2018-09-08 16:49:36 You’d make an excellent snake oil salesman.
6363 2018-09-08 16:49:17 You should share your tale of currency consensus success with Iran & China. I believe they’re both having a similar dilemma with what currency to price their oil in.

6370 2018-09-08 16:48:34 Give me a break. This isn't about human rights. This is about OIL.

And even today believe #Kavanaugh’s should join the Supremes despite perjury?
If only you had the power to stop such madness, @BenSasse.
6373 2018-09-08 16:47:51 A pot of oil and a strainer does the same thing, plus they're easier to clean than a deep fryer.

The only thing a deep fryer helps with is just seeing the temperature.

Most foods fry well in a pot of oil at medium-high heat.
6374 2018-09-08 16:47:47 Assad doesn't have oil rich lands. There was very little oil in Syria before the war. As for the rest, he needs help.
6375 2018-09-08 16:47:07 Wow...very refreshing to hear @WilliamsRuto. Now lets get to arranging for the building of the industrial facilities and processing plants to actualize this rhetoric to reality. Start with the refinery for Turkana crude oil. RUTO...that must be your legacy project.

You make so many excuses to bring down Oil Prices but fail. 

Convince P. M. to leave his oath to reduce the oil price.

 Nursing pays well and it’s certain he’ll land a job, in fact the Govt facilitates Nurses landing jobs. There’s a nurse shortage.

6388 2018-09-08 16:45:58 @D_Wool @TylemakerV @K_Borst19 Dom think the Yotes will have more points than the Oil this year. Sorry boys.
6389 2018-09-08 16:45:54 Found reason after 4.5 years.  Not a single time @dpradhanbjp @narendramodi claimed that there are Rs 2,00,000 cr due on oil bond from May 2014.  Dear PM,  please understand . But middle class people get affected by fuel price hike badly.
6390 2018-09-08 16:45:48 You are a #fraud! you were AG when I was 1st arrested falsely. I'm an environmental activist. You are lying about Big oil; #fracking; you refuse to stop #overfishing, legal destructive fishing & unbridled #immigration. Leaf blower emission will surpass those of vehicles! SHAME!
6391 2018-09-08 16:45:45 How is the war on terror successful? There’s no end in sight in Afghanistan and Iraq. US intervention in Guatemala, Iran and Chile all led to leaders who were terrible for their people. Military rule in Venezuela won’t make their oil more valuable and won’t fix anything.
6392 2018-09-08 16:45:39 The squeaky wheel gets the oil..goodbye Drax. But I'm with you
6393 2018-09-08 16:45:38 I wouldn’t say we are turning a blind eye. They are just waiting for theright moment. They can’t simply start dropping bombs because they will lose the oil. That is why Russia, Iran, and the US are waiting patiently. This whole thing is about the oil. Billions and billions in oil

6395 2018-09-08 16:45:30 Just look in to Petrol price consists of, cost of crude oil ,refiner expenses, transportation, agent commission, central tax & State taxes, in addition some States charges cess, analysing  petrol tax structure, States getting more contribution than Central ,
6396 2018-09-08 16:45:25 Do you think this is immiscibility or necking? It's weird to have oil inclusions with no bubbles in the same assemblage as gas inclusions with condensate rims.
6397 2018-09-08 16:45:17 I love when @JenCapone1 suffer a tickle torture. It would be nice @JenCapone1 tied bare feet tickle tortured for intense 1 hour NOSTOP, only with  nails, with oil under her feet but  without cut scenes, without break,  without she letting breathe and  without safeword for her
6398 2018-09-08 16:45:07 Whether or not people believe in climate change, no one can deny that coal, oil and gas are finite resources and will eventually run out. We have a choice between a smooth transition and being dumped into a world without power when our resources suddenly run out.

6400 2018-09-08 16:44:43 Thanks  Its pretty simple, it’s retributior armour spray, the tamyia clear red spray. Followed by an all over wash of Nuln oil/Nuln oil gloss (50/50 mix) It’s had a coat of dullcote to protect it and so it’s easier to paint over.  I will gloss varnish the red when done.
6401 2018-09-08 16:44:43 Then we are taxed at the pump as well.  Oil is the most taxed product in the country.
6402 2018-09-08 16:44:39 The last two years have seen significant oil and natural gas discoveries in Uganda, Mozambique, Tanzania, Somalia, and Kenya, with oil in Turkana, Kenya, expected to flow by 2018  #GunsOfMiserywithLagat

1. We generate electrical power (Turkana windmills) and after completion, we realize we don't have infrastructures to transmit it to Nairobi (National Grid)
2. Oil discovered in Kenya, Drilling takes place only to realise we don't have a refinery

6407 2018-09-08 16:43:39 It has more to do with over-reliance on oil which can be subject to volatile prices. But US is bad and did it sounds like a neat narrative.

6409 2018-09-08 16:43:23 Oil is not subsidized it is heavily taxed.  It’s taxed with GPT when it’s drilled, the royalties paid to land owners are taxed.  The employees that drill it are taxed on income, the driller is taxed on income.  The refinery is taxed, the gas station is taxed.

6411 2018-09-08 16:43:02 Is there not a cost to all of us when AB oil is used? Why can't we (Canadians) replace this industry with something that doesn't cause environmental harm to all of us. We hated Harper for supporting the Asbestos industry. Isn't tarsands in the same category?
6412 2018-09-08 16:43:00 You don’t need them on the front line defending America’s oil interests. It’s in their hair.

6417 2018-09-08 16:42:45 It may be really hard if the jobs go and aren't replaced, just as it has been hard on the ex-coal mining villages round the central belt and Fife. At the same time, the prosperity from North Sea oil has been at the cost of some parts of the world already becoming uninhabitable.
6418 2018-09-08 16:42:22 I need my oil changed.  Do I need to make a appointment? Maybe after nap time?

6495 2018-09-08 16:33:15 Iran is an autocracy run by religious zealots who incarcerate people on the flimsiest excuse, persecute, execute and torture their own people. They distribute terror like oil and are undemocratic cruel and without morals so don't pontificate on an embassy opening.
6496 2018-09-08 16:33:12 Every govt does that. I'm blaming both govt. But wasn't it the central govt that increased excise duty every time there was decrease in crude oil prices??? But while in opposition they were protesting for the same.

6500 2018-09-08 16:32:57 Also clarification on  oil. Normally you get ~ 300 mg of Omega 3s per 1000 mg of  oil. Not all  oils are equal. @US_FDA recommends you not exceed 3000 mg of Omega 3s a day. I am taking in ~ 1800 mg of Omega 3s daily.  I think many competitive lifters take more than me 
6501 2018-09-08 16:32:56 Sick n tired of luking at the oil prices every day...! Nauseating!!

6505 2018-09-08 16:32:43 It's not Info on Elon Musk. The author gives examples on how liberals are parroting conservatives' talking points. This whole fight against Elon is also a fight against EVs and environmental regulations. It plays right in the hands of climate change deniers and pro oil.

6515 2018-09-08 16:31:35 yes, in Telugu it was known as 'Manchi nunae' meaning good oil
6516 2018-09-08 16:31:31 There is not genocide in Venezuela. There is crisis resulting from failed government policies, loss of oil revenue, corruption & intentional sabotage by opposition aided by foreign powers.
Acceptable outcome would be cooler heads all around leading to compromises & reconciliation

6519 2018-09-08 16:31:27 I suggest people make & install their own labels with such as part of guerrilla agitating propaganda/education tactic. However, I believe most palm oil is being used to make biodiesel for Europeans.

6521 2018-09-08 16:31:23 The NDA government repaid over Rs 2 lakh crore, including Rs 70,000 crore interest, which was taken as a loan through oil bonds by the previous Congress government at the Centre, Union Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on June 26 2018 .
6522 2018-09-08 16:31:22 Think how we’d feel if we had oil rigs offshore.
6523 2018-09-08 16:31:16 Gotta clean my whip and get an oil change today. Then I’m tryna vibe all day.
6524 2018-09-08 16:31:16 "Booze is the oil in our motors, the thing that keeps us purring when we should be making other kinds of noise... We can't afford to live lives we have to fool our own central nervous systems into tolerating."

This is resonating deeply with me today... Thank you @KristiCCoulter
6525 2018-09-08 16:31:12 Pradhanji oil price hike is not knee jerk but knee breaking action.
Hind National Party
6526 2018-09-08 16:31:08 Remember - his original statement about phasing out the oil sands.  Every action since then, shows he meant that statement and someone should hold him to account on it.
6527 2018-09-08 16:31:06 Ayyye money my guy  that oil refinery 
6528 2018-09-08 16:30:29 @realDonaldTrump hi
6529 2018-09-08 16:30:26 Good... Hope the government will cut back its oil supply so we in India will have more stock by which the price can be reduced. Also this Oli was never with India. He's a communist. Best for China to pick up that bill too..
6530 2018-09-08 16:30:24 #shapers4climate challenge: I pledge to make sure that oil is properly dispose.  @sciencecomedian what would be your climate pledge for 2018? @climatereality @WeDontHaveTime0 @wef
6531 2018-09-08 16:30:23 $76.22 is Brent crude price where as the PSU's OM are buying their oil from gulf states mostly. That cost is less than $68.
6532 2018-09-08 16:30:20 Re did my essential oil thread on how to spot fakes with no Joanne the Scammer gigs  hope y’all enjoy it. I’ll be adding to it. So it isn’t finished

6534 2018-09-08 16:29:56 “Conservative intellectuals” have no support. No one supports tax cuts for the wealthy, not regulating oil companies, and on and on and on. You get that into law on the back of votes for “cultural conservatism,” for decades now. Libertarianism just doesn’t have the support
6535 2018-09-08 16:29:50 Depends on the import slate.  If US prod has displaced other lights from the import slate, it could be a systemic shift in imports of crude oil.  The amount of heavy imported might be higher than in the past, to accommodate higher ref-runs, even while total imports are lower.
6536 2018-09-08 16:29:48 Russian , Chinese and Turkish companies will be contracted paid by Syrian oil revenues. wallstreet calls this profits
6537 2018-09-08 16:29:48 Ostia... Yo me quedo con 3&K, porque le tengo muchisimo cariño, pero creo que como juego es mejor Mania, en todos sus aspectos es como minimo bueno, aunque es practicamente excelente (menos oil ocean) esque los dos son juegazos, ¿tu cual te quedas?
6538 2018-09-08 16:29:47 I just wanna massage castor oil into her scalp for her poor hairline 
6539 2018-09-08 16:29:44 One year ago what it looked like cake-walk for Modi in 2019 now appears a challenging one. weakening of INR against dollar and rising oil prices is no policy fault of Modi, NDA has not been successful in taking the fruits of social and economic reforms to the general public.

6541 2018-09-08 16:29:38 Rightly said. The common ppl dont give a damn that upa left crores of loan, BJP paying it back, so oil price is highest. They just look their pocket.
6542 2018-09-08 16:29:33 Lol, you don’t get to hide in shadows with him. That’s what you actually need 
6543 2018-09-08 16:29:21 Alaskans own 23,533 shares of ULTRA PETROLEUM CORP, worth $157,200. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in CANADA.
6544 2018-09-08 16:29:20 It freaks Westminster out. They need the oil revenue as well as tourism, fish, whisky. Populationwise similar to Norway. A bit of work needed on welfare dependency. I will genuinely move back if indy happens. Wrong side of 50 but every little helps. Wife a teacher   pretty handy
6545 2018-09-08 16:29:10 Oil on the top isn't it.... Ok, deep breath.

6554 2018-09-08 16:28:17 You all went to into the Service to protect USA and the battle was to ruin other countries for the Cabal’s greed of oil and other riches War creates! Lives lost..on both sides for the Cabal. Even 9-11 was an inside job.  Wake up.. the enemy lives among us.

6560 2018-09-08 16:28:01 It's a SEAL thing. They put (grassfed) butter in their coffee to increase calorie intake and energy. Except they also put palm oil in it too, so it's an oversimplification.
6561 2018-09-08 16:27:55 Saying that with a straight face is the funniest thing I've heard in awhile! Honesty, Integrity and transparency are certainly qualities NOT used by this Snake oil salesman! Corruption at its finest! #hypocrisy #liarsleakersliberals #WakeUpAmerica #LIES #LiesLiesLies
6562 2018-09-08 16:27:54 Venezuela has the Biggest Known OIL Reserves in the World which is Nationalised  Go Figure what the hell the UK have post Brexit  - Venezuela shouldn't be bankrupt but the model Corbyn so admires has brought that country to its knees
6563 2018-09-08 16:27:50 Done beli engine oil. Dapat lah diskaun lagi sempena 9.9.
6564 2018-09-08 16:27:49 Everything that is great has some problems but those spills pale in comparison to how much oil naturally seeps into our waters. Curious though, millions of birds and bats are killed by windmills, is that OK because you perceive it as “green”?
6565 2018-09-08 16:27:46 Peanut oil used to be cheaper than Sesame oil and is also used widely in Andhra during upto 80s

6568 2018-09-08 16:27:17 Just spoke to our oil delivery person.  He estimates an increase of 15% in oil prices this year.  He’s also an elected Republican.  I mentioned my 2% raise.  He said that he “hopes” the economy keeps pumping.  I said “Hope is NOT a strategy, what else ya got?” Him: “Nothing.”
6569 2018-09-08 16:27:12 Or, shld we leave dictators in place&get blamed for not caring, or take dictators out&get all the oil?
6570 2018-09-08 16:26:56 Cooked it with oil mate thats fried
6571 2018-09-08 16:26:54 Compare the crude oil price in 2013 and now. It was more than 120$ per barrel. Now it's 85$ / barrel.
6572 2018-09-08 16:26:48 I LOVE knocking things out in the morning. Especially if I can fit in a nail appointment or an oil change lol. Makes the rest of the day a carefree breeze
6573 2018-09-08 16:26:40 And I'm never giving you up either "Oil Tot". Nope. Your a true one of a kind that I'm blessed to have as a friend each and everyday! Hugs for this adorable "Teddy Bear" that no one can ever compete with! Your pretty much stuck with me if you haven't caught on.

6577 2018-09-08 16:26:07 mustard oil is not used in entire north. predominantly in WB(and eastern UP?). UP uses til ka tel quite a bit
6578 2018-09-08 16:26:05 Dharmendra Pradhan says fuel price hike is an unavoidable situation, blames US dollar :-
IT IS NEEDLESS TO SAY - EXTERNAL
FACTORS BEHIND OIL PRICE RISE.
6579 2018-09-08 16:26:04 If this country didn't have oil we wouldn't care at all becuz our actions are never motivated by real hr's, it's always about sought-after resources. The US pattern is to sanction targeted country, create chaos & hardship for its ppl, then attack under the guise of hr's. Repeat.
6580 2018-09-08 16:26:03 Pradhanji...AAP oil price par dhyan na de kar janta ka majak mat udaye.Please don't become antipeople. This may prove suicidal for 2019 elections.

6582 2018-09-08 16:26:00 i finally got a plug for vape oil  so excited to never ever use a fucking grinder, paper clip or lighter ever again lol

6588 2018-09-08 16:25:04 Also you should get organic beard oil and use 2-3 drops max on your beard everyday, along with beard shampoo usage every 2-3 days. The key is to get the oil in the roots more so than the ends of the hair, so rub deep

6591 2018-09-08 16:24:51 Thank you! I'm pretty open and would be eager to hear what kind of opportunities are out there. I've been working as an economist on oil markets; interests are more towards the climate/conservation side. May I shoot you a DM to chat sometime?

My lips are less dry and chapped, thanks to castor oil. Now I aim for pinkish lips.
6594 2018-09-08 16:24:21 We used to make pickles with it, we call it pappu noone. But for some reason now everyone is using groundnut oil for pickles. For regular cooking, sunflower. Sesame oil is only used for lighting diyas or giving shani daan now.
6595 2018-09-08 16:24:20 Do it! If you don’t like it do an at home hot oil treatment and wash with dandruff shampoo

6602 2018-09-08 16:23:18 and like i said in deeparadhana. no other oil can be used. very strictly followed. the other n better option is cow-ghee
6603 2018-09-08 16:23:17 Article wouldn't render 4 me. I don't hate Millenials. I assume there are reasons they are the way they are. Including the way they were raised by MY peer generation.  My own crimes were all of omission, not realizing how often other ppl's bad choices would impact my family.
6604 2018-09-08 16:23:13 Why is the price of petrol in India so high, besides many countries have lower prices?

There are many reasons behind high petrol price in india ,some are due to government policies and other are like political stability in oil producing countries,demand in... http://so.why/
6605 2018-09-08 16:23:13 And a person selling snake oil isn’t like Obama...he has gifts and contrary to the foolish denial of the right wing the Democrats need someone to listen to now

6610 2018-09-08 16:22:55 Cous cous with roast veg (courgette peppers red onion tomatoes in lemon juice, salt and pepper, minced garlic, chilli flakes and olive oil) and feta crumbled on top. Or black bean chilli - both very easy to do a big vat.
6611 2018-09-08 16:22:50 Officially a huge advocate for CBD oil. It totally calmed down my anxiety attack, but didn’t make me drowsy. 10/10 recommend.
6612 2018-09-08 16:22:32 If you trucked oil, the rates would be cut, we never should have deregulated the trucking industry. Big companies only have to make a small amount on each unit and the small guys get pushed out

6616 2018-09-08 16:22:06 You’re missing that China increasingly no longer needs to hold USD for any reason.  They announced this 5 yrs ago.  China still receives USD of course, but instead of holding those USDs in USTs, now they hold them in commodities, oil refineries, ghost cities, OBOR, gold.

The weight to engine ratio meant in THEORY it could reach 40km but I have my doubts the suspension would hold and yeah Germany already had oil shortages.

6639 2018-09-08 16:20:16 Our GDP growth is almost driven by oil sector since 2017. We are damaging the rest of the sectors. At this rate, we might see decline in GDP growth in 2019. We are just not producing and borrowing to consume.
6640 2018-09-08 16:20:11 Anyone fry with coconut oil ?
6641 2018-09-08 16:20:09 Hopefully next time they lose clothes and someone has baby oil on hand, then this beef will be interesting
6642 2018-09-08 16:20:05 Hmm, ok

I have a feeling it tastes only like Palm oil after all that extreme sport. 
6643 2018-09-08 16:19:52 Don't forget 30w oil for generator! You definitely should consider getting mom & dad inland. Won't be long before roads are jammed, gas is gone. By Tuesday it may be too late.
6644 2018-09-08 16:19:46 All of you can check gifs and clips in #RedVelVet_REDMAREinBKK and if you have any question, I’ll translate it for u. PS. Bae hit Wan’s butt again. 
6645 2018-09-08 16:19:45 #RenasArmy: you've still got time to go to your local bodega or botanica to buy a candle/candles with "blessing oil" and sage incense for today's #USOpen Women's Final. If no bodega w/obligatory cat nearby, find your local street vendor for incense & grocery store for candles.
6646 2018-09-08 16:19:25 กลับไปดู am your king เฉย
6647 2018-09-08 16:19:24 さんについて行こ…
6648 2018-09-08 16:19:23 Yeah dove soap always handle business truthfully but that Cocoa Butter cleansing oil does wonders.
6649 2018-09-08 16:18:59 僕を酸化させたらダメだよ。オイルにとって酸化は命取り。…僕を見守っててね⁇
6650 2018-09-08 16:18:55 Sea oil 48 pa kaya dun muna ko hahahaha sad
6651 2018-09-08 16:18:54 "USA is waging a war against Venezuela in the media and economically! Why? #Venezuela has biggest know oil reserves in the world, the USA wants control of it". That about sums it up. Ppl just collateral damage
6652 2018-09-08 16:18:49 Give me a brash, loud mouth guy from Queens who respects and adheres to the constitution over a smooth talking snake oil salesman who took a crap on it for eight years.
6653 2018-09-08 16:18:35 Their magnetic pillar dabbed in castor oil wedged into their fun ovens
6654 2018-09-08 16:18:25 Got my cars oil changed today... it’s amazing how much better it drives 
6655 2018-09-08 16:17:47 Yes, but the discussion was predominantly the oil sector, no? Those are mainly the people out of work in Calgary, right now. And who's fault is it Calgary and much of AB is such a 1-trick pony. PC's had over 40 years to wean this province of oil's teat. They failed.
6656 2018-09-08 16:17:42 The black smoke indicates oil or rubber burning. Likely an arms depot
6657 2018-09-08 16:17:26 Cory Booker: "I'm taking all this bread AND a packet of oil AND herbs!"

Waitress: "Sir this is Carabba's. We offer unlimited bread and a loaf to go."

Cory Booker: "YOU CAN'T STOP ME!"
6658 2018-09-08 16:17:24 Yeah, I'm with Gene. I'd have to shave every single day and it hurts. One day I might go back to clean shaven but for now I keep the beard trimmed with clean edges. I'm not on this beard oil thing though. Teach me the ways!
6659 2018-09-08 16:17:23 Dove soap & Palmers Skin Therapy Cleansing Oil Face. Let em both sit as I brush and moisturize my hair. Wipe it off and put my Durag on 
6660 2018-09-08 16:17:15 I think this has Putin written all over it.  Follow the money and in this case, the oil.  The US is doing Putin's dirty work for him.
6661 2018-09-08 16:17:15 Idk if I’ve asked this before but has anyone/ does anyone use CBD oil??
6662 2018-09-08 16:17:01 I actually hate the taste of oil but I just seeped how much I hate it loool
6663 2018-09-08 16:16:59 さん素敵！！
6664 2018-09-08 16:16:58 Good question.   Because as hard as its tried to diversify its economy,  big oil is still driving the engine.  I'd totally agree with the idea that the carbon tax is hurting the recovery.   It should have been implemented in good times,  not bad IMO.
6665 2018-09-08 16:16:55 Singed up with Venezuelan oil like his dad?
6666 2018-09-08 16:16:46 はるさんこわい＞＜
6667 2018-09-08 16:16:45 The whole idea of them being together is a mystery. Oil and water don't mix. Must of been a spell.

6672 2018-09-08 16:16:29 or even just using the word "AROUND".... so I wonder. Are there people on the BOTTOM side of the pancake? Aren't they worried about all that oil drilling? Where does the water fall to at the edge? Manomanoman.... so weird.

6683 2018-09-09 23:57:20 Tired of food companies advertising the ~*wEeD*~ in their lattes/food/candy. It’s CBD oil. Sure it’s the same plant, but there are no intoxicating/psychoactive properties in the oil
6684 2018-09-09 23:57:19 Hey remember that time the US overthrew the democratically elected leader of Iran in 1953 for oil and installed a dictator?

6688 2018-09-09 23:56:19 Oh that sucks, I hate waiting for an oil change.  Takes forever.
6689 2018-09-09 23:56:12 Because without those “friend” world will go back to gunboat capitalism because gasoline price would have spiked to 10$/ gallon (which pretty much a death sentence for ~1 Billion people) but hey not everyone imports their oil.

6710 2018-09-09 23:56:08 If your goal is "happily ever after" with a loving partner, these snake oil salesmen don't model that.

If it is to be a "success" - a high-value man - why? The game is rigged anyway, and none of these men are that anyway.

Be you. Treat women as people, not assets.
6711 2018-09-09 23:56:01 don't have eucalyptus, been using peppermint oil
6712 2018-09-09 23:55:13 Hi @AdamMancini4, what time frames do you use or recommend for charting for swing trades, daily or hourly, particularly for natgas and oil?
6713 2018-09-09 23:55:08 IDK. I made some banana oat muffins today and they were the bomb.  No sugar, oil, or flour.
6714 2018-09-09 23:55:03 Yes I said about 18 months

Again
it NOT just Tax Cuts
It's STEPs

Deregulation

Corporate repatriation

American Oil and Gas exportation

Wage growth

Federal Reserve interest rate stabilization

New trade deals

Lowest unemployment in years

Trump has America in GROWTH MODE
6715 2018-09-09 23:54:55 @NicoleLean Would you and Olive Oil do a video to Girlfriend

U tube video!
6716 2018-09-09 23:54:37 I was also impressed by the number of uses of limonene, Ludmilla! I never would have guessed it was also found as an ingredient in cannabis oil.
6717 2018-09-09 23:54:31 Sing a chorus of Oil Thigh!
6718 2018-09-09 23:54:31 Cannabis oil will be legalized in the uk hopefully within a year
6719 2018-09-09 23:54:25 Trump is sending Energy Secretary Rick Perry to Moscow. What could go wrong other than giving Putin oil drilling leases all along the Pacific Coast from San Diego to the Arctic?
6720 2018-09-09 23:54:17 Put some oil on it or do it after you get out of the shower.
6721 2018-09-09 23:53:49 I may have just gotten my father into vaping cbd oil lmao
6722 2018-09-09 23:53:44 クソじわるだろwww
6723 2018-09-09 23:53:26 Course with pistachio dullard and quality olive oil.
6724 2018-09-09 23:53:08 I started using coconut oil for my hair and bro, my scalp is thanking me. Why didn’t I start using this sooner
6725 2018-09-09 23:53:05 I have barely smoked at all since the miracle of oil vaping . I spend four months of the year in CA so I’m up on the trends 
6726 2018-09-09 23:52:50 It would be an absolute disaster for the US (Trump) to place further sanctions on Venezuela. Oil exports are the primary revenue for Venezuela and have worsened immigration. The US should accept migrants instead of making matters worse for them?

6734 2018-09-09 23:52:07 And oil. And extention cords. And if you're new to the generator game, give her a test run first. Be safe and be prepared.
6735 2018-09-09 23:51:42 Things like this are & will be par for the course with this illegitimate president & his complicit, donor-owned GOP continuing in power.  What do you think, VP Penance?  Anyone with a conscience can't allow it to continue with wrist slaps to the toxic oil industry. Vote Dem!
6736 2018-09-09 23:51:29 I need all the essential oil candles
6737 2018-09-09 23:51:26 The Hill is now talking rubbish on climate change.
Must be getting paid off by large oil companies.
6738 2018-09-09 23:51:21 There’s oil deals to make since since the Exxon venture fell through
6739 2018-09-09 23:51:15 Lol, with that nicely scented oil...
6740 2018-09-09 23:51:06 bought cbd oil for sleep, in so ready
6741 2018-09-09 23:50:57 D I really like this area of California are friendly to me on my car keys back after my oil change, he….
6742 2018-09-09 23:50:47 First oil and filter change today for the new Dodge Charger. We drained and filled the differential too. 1455 miles
6743 2018-09-09 23:50:21 Lost of jobs as oil is drilled by foreign companies, hence our political heads does nothing other than share the sales proceeds.

180 million Nigerian eating, sleeping & contributing nothing to the world. All we do is drill oil, sell it, bank the money & few share the proceeds!
6744 2018-09-09 23:50:04 It could be a bit of both tbh, other than oil changes I suck at keeping up with maintenance  lol
6745 2018-09-09 23:50:01 Females get a car & don't check the oil, tire pressure, coolant, nothing they just wake up and drive that mf.
6746 2018-09-09 23:49:53 This is a oil painting not the real scene…
6747 2018-09-09 23:49:42 Got coconut oil in my eye it’s blowing me
6748 2018-09-09 23:49:25 Just get the oil moving and the country back on track from the awful libs

6751 2018-09-09 23:49:04 MOAR OLIVE OIL
6752 2018-09-09 23:48:54 Sick a couple onion quarters and halved lemons in, generously season with salt & pepper & whatever else, plus butter and/or olive oil, 400 F for 20 mins then turn down to 350 for 20 mins a pound, or so.
6753 2018-09-09 23:48:44 Wasn't even the smell, he was angry about the oil being in a pan he didn't even use. He has outbursts rather than clearly having the condition all the time.  If ever anyone wants proof he has aspergers, they just have to tell him he does and run for cover
6754 2018-09-09 23:48:15 sadly local governments have little incentive and the US as a govt only cares about oil supply and stability for investments. end the drug war removes the single biggest US imposed corruption racket over 50 years, end the embargo ends the Cuban revolution and Maduro evaporates.
6755 2018-09-09 23:48:14 That one was exceptionally sneaky. He was under the mower. I fueled it up, checked the oil, fired it up and backed it out from under the shed and there it was under the mower. Mrs Pigweed made short work of it....
6756 2018-09-09 23:48:11 Great job brother
6757 2018-09-09 23:48:06 Big oil without subsidies would be small oil. Tired of subsidizing an industry that's so Fukin harmful. Invest in renewable energy and subsidize that.
6758 2018-09-09 23:47:23 silk elements olive oil something. It’s in a brown bottle , I returned it back to the store lol
6759 2018-09-09 23:47:21 Me with box mixes tbh.

Use softened butter instead of oil. Milk instead of water. Boom.
6760 2018-09-09 23:47:02 Roasted with olive oil, thyme, onions...with a hint of lemon.
6761 2018-09-09 23:46:57 my mom sells cbd oil and suddenly she thinks she’s a drug dealer
6762 2018-09-09 23:46:52 Actually, Ted is his own self propagating oil well, hence the unnatural sheen and the “slick” hair.
6763 2018-09-09 23:46:49 Putin cares about his country indirectly because it’s his money & power source the difference is that Russia is an oil exporting states so they can afford to treat their citizen horribly (and they treat their citizen horribly for a hundreds of years) and still exist as a nations.

6765 2018-09-09 23:46:44 My friend told me about tiles at the Andrews Inn - a lesbian bar in Vermont when haters  would stand outside on a Saturday night and throw tunafish cans with the tuna and nasty oil and THE CAN  at the lesbians when they left just to harass and abuse us. 
6766 2018-09-09 23:46:26 Might have been a bit less "beneficial" if it hadn't been for the Marshall Plan helping rebuild. Britian was broke by the end of the war. Also, the same kind of analysis shows oil spills as a benefit.

6771 2018-09-09 23:45:11 I can change a flat tire, change oil and filter, replace and burnt fuse, fix a broken wiper and wash my car when i feel like doing it. Learn most of it from youtube. Imagine how much money i have saved so far! 
6772 2018-09-09 23:45:04 oh you're right because there are government regulations against literally selling snake oil as cure alls, it's not a REAL free market.
6773 2018-09-09 23:44:57 That peppermint oil woke my scalp right on up!
6774 2018-09-09 23:44:52 A beautiful oil painting, Ginlue! 
6775 2018-09-09 23:44:49 Spare me! Start talking Fracking and what oil companies are fine with doing to OUR precious drinking water!!!

6778 2018-09-09 23:44:32 There's one big difference: Syria gave the Russians permission to help DEFEND Syria from the attacks of US-UK-Saudi-Israeli terrorist proxies. The US didn't get permission to bomb anything. They just started bombing for regime change & used their proxies to steal oil.
6779 2018-09-09 23:44:27 Galangan kapal tutup itu fenomena global krn isu lingkungan, peralihan ke renewable energi,produksi minyak menurun harga crude oil turun,off shore inactive jadi operasi kapal berkurang manfaatkan yg ada.

6781 2018-09-09 23:44:05 True, very true. And we’re looking into all those as well! Brakes are the worst for sure. But tires and oil change not that bad! Ferrari’s are the bad ones for oil changes! But the brakes are defiantly bad because the carbon ceramics! Your 100% correct!
6782 2018-09-09 23:43:49 Boneless ribeye grilled on a Weber over charcoal - medium. Baked potato baked on the grill - with butter, sour cream, and chives. Fresh asparagus on the grill in foil with olive oil and sea salt. And a nice glass of a good red wine. 
6783 2018-09-09 23:43:49 What does black seed oil do?
6784 2018-09-09 23:43:48 If I remember correctly I was working in the booming oil sands at that time , plus when the financial crash hit.  We Canadians came out without a major catastrophe like the other countries.   And he made sure. We All were  working .  Coast to coast

6792 2018-09-09 23:42:48 Rex Tillerson and Exxon oil make huge oil drilling deal with russia owned Rosneft oil. Obama shuts down contract. Trump hires Tillerson at Putin's request. 45 didn't know R.T. before that. Trump waives $400k salary to get elected. Qatar now buys $11B of Rosneft oil...
6793 2018-09-09 23:42:43 Already opened the windows in this house more than Lucas Oil Stadium, and it only cost 2 taxpayers a few dollars.

6797 2018-09-09 23:42:15 What happens when your mclaren needs serviced? Brakes, Tires, oil, etc. that shit nearly costs as much as your WRX. People who go car broke to flash a set of keys are dumb. If you’re buying a mclaren you can afford to own multiple nice cars soooooooooooooooooo. 
6798 2018-09-09 23:42:06 i burnt my lip with oil. that is not okay 
6799 2018-09-09 23:42:01 The Diamondbacks bullpen has been leaking oil for some time now. It’s become a permanent gash. These guys are cooked. Hate to say it
6800 2018-09-09 23:41:51 Greek. The oil and vinegar kind, not the creamy greek, which is nice but still. Also, I prefer to make my own. Man  I aound like a snob.
6801 2018-09-09 23:41:46 / My tattoo is at the healing stage where clothes are hell, and I'd do anything to lay naked in coconut oil all day.

Goodbye.
6802 2018-09-09 23:41:40 I have to make sure and clearly label my coconut oil jars. One for cooking, two for sexing. #rentboyproblem

6807 2018-09-09 23:41:03 I use that brand. I love the Tea Tree one. I like to use a bit of coconut oil and let it sit for a few minutes, then shampoo and condition my hair. It’s silky smooth and soft for days!

6819 2018-09-09 23:39:33 It finally stopped bleeding after the warm sea salt soak, I used an antiseptic balm called Zam-Buk on it today and it's working great! It's basically a combination of Eucalyptus, Thyme, Sassafras oil and camphor.
6820 2018-09-09 23:39:20 Oil and water do not mix, as we all know.　　みんなが知っているように，油と水は混ざらない。

6823 2018-09-09 23:38:44 Any progressive who was awake saw what obama did. Allowed our oil to be exported, cut food stamps, drilling, fracking etc.  But I am going to sit back and watch him drive trump over the edge. I have no idea what trump's obsession is with obama but he has one.  In the meantime we
6824 2018-09-09 23:38:41 happy sunday

6830 2018-09-09 23:37:55 My dislike isn't the promise or weak as shit did runner halfway through job, no what annoyed me is people he hurt, I knew people involved thought he was a hero, after working with him said never meet your heroes, snake oil salesman and they are the nice things
6831 2018-09-09 23:37:45 Bringing new industries that aren't coal or oil, increases education costs to the state. Dimes are spent, Wyoming dimes, to bring this company here. I'm glad they've decided to relocate in the Cowboy state. It just doesn't come cost-free.
6832 2018-09-09 23:37:40 今日涼しい
6833 2018-09-09 23:37:39 Lemme tie you up, cover you in oil, and fuck your face.

6835 2018-09-09 23:37:16 The key word is "eventually." There are some very old working ships, and there are some very long-standing oil rigs. If something is engineered and built correctly (and regularly painted and lubricated), it can last for a VERY long time at sea - even through typhoons.

6837 2018-09-09 23:37:00 I didn’t change my oil for 3 years it’s probably fine
6838 2018-09-09 23:36:36 Oil demand growth is expected to rise by 1.64 million barrels a day to 98.83 million barrels a day this year, according to OPEC estimates. It should rise again to reach 100.26 million barrels a day in 2019.

6840 2018-09-09 23:36:18 @WilliamShatner 
Mr Shatner, I just wanted to thank you for your book ‘Live long and...’
I found your honesty and candour made very compelling reading which was both moving and inspirational. 
...plus I will be increasing my exercise and trying sliced beats cooked in olive oil
6841 2018-09-09 23:36:11 Well put 
6842 2018-09-09 23:36:08 There is enough oil to last at least 150 years so your point is?
6843 2018-09-09 23:36:06 Oil producers tightened their belts during crude oil's sell-offs in 2014 and 2015, in an attempt to minimize losses. Exxon Mobil, for instance, reduced its exploration expenses in 2014 by 15 percent and by another 9 percent in 2015.

6845 2018-09-09 23:35:30 Will be another interesting week in the Republican Matrix.  Trump has it partially right... It is indeed a well oiled chaos creating machine.  And the oil is snake oil.
6846 2018-09-09 23:35:19 He needs some castor oil and some hope sksksjd
6847 2018-09-09 23:35:18 Guess he wants women at home/ kitchen, cooking steaks and fries.
And no dyed hair. Skirts and dresses ok, but no pants.
No windmills or solar cells.
Lots of gas/oil
Huh huh huh (tim allen home improv)
Yeah, tofu is really really Bad.

6851 2018-09-09 23:34:43 Amen! BHO - KING snake oil salesman!
6852 2018-09-09 23:34:35 I either mix olive oil, balsamic vinegar, ground pepper, and garlic-  or tomato sauce, garlic powder, Italian seasoning and parmesan cheese to dunk pizza crust in. Cheese stuffed or plain. Like ketchup with fries, I omit neither.
6853 2018-09-09 23:34:05 Soaking your clothes in oil to avoid oil stains
6854 2018-09-09 23:34:04 Lumiit ang taxes ng mga employees pero tumaas ang purchasing power nila. Dahil sa bagong tax reform law kaya tumaas lahat. Pero imbis na unahin nila 'yan amiendahan. Bakit hindi ang oil diregulation law ni Ramos noon? Ayun talaga ang puno't dula ng lahat.

6861 2018-09-09 23:32:51 These ppl are paid to sit around and think these things up. What is their motivation beyond making money? Dont tell me nothing. They are visionaries guiding and shaping society to their world views,  they say so.
6862 2018-09-09 23:32:35 The new oil well
6863 2018-09-09 23:31:56 Roasted roots: sweet potatoes, carrots, turnips, beets, parsnips. Toss in oil, add rosemary. Mmm.
6864 2018-09-09 23:31:48 Oh yes the oil, I knew there was a reason all these yemeni people had to die. 
The U.S. needs oil so obviously Yemen must be destroyed and its people murdered
6865 2018-09-09 23:31:30 Only having read this review and not the book(s) itself makes me question if greed for money and power by Mega Energy producers is part of his equation. I mean, the cheap production of oil, coal and gas pales next to the cost of true R&D into renewables, so they don't bother.
6866 2018-09-09 23:30:59 The energy secretary in Moscow? Right when Russia is *desperate* to raise oil prices?
6867 2018-09-09 23:30:57 Still telling the same lies, and trying to sell yourself with them.  SNAKE OIL.  LIES.  Disgusting.   Go buy a conscience.
6868 2018-09-09 23:30:57 As sure as prisons are the models for the city

I nurtured my need for oil and electricity
6869 2018-09-09 23:30:52 We Pakistanis had no clue & talk .... Pakistan was near default in 2013.. to the extent that even friend countries were asking us for cash to supply oil... our ratings were bad... no one investing in Pakistan... so risk was high...later our credit ratings improved significantly
6870 2018-09-09 23:30:51 The 2014 ref white paper was built on Oil. It's a fossil fuel. To think anything else is very naive. My real point, if you care to engage is anyone and everyone can score small points. It's relatively pointless. However my point remains. In Scotland G = SNP to the public eye.
6871 2018-09-09 23:30:46 This has a major effect on the status of the African countries’ economic prosperity, stripping their governments from any economic control, because of the loss of ruling over the oil.

6879 2018-09-09 23:29:48 Bless you! That happens to me quite a lot! What’s the secret to the twisting of the oil cap?
6880 2018-09-09 23:29:39 Ouch, having your oil checked, upper and lower?
6881 2018-09-09 23:29:32 Scalp. A million times the scalp. That’s sheer oil and grease build up. Think about how unwashed hair smells, and now imagine the smell of grease scraped directly from the scalp. Sigh. This is a lose-lose situation.

6906 2018-09-09 23:25:03 I read Trump was given a percentage of Russia’s state owned oil company. That is why Trump and Russia want the sanctions taken off.
6907 2018-09-09 23:24:33 How is strip-mining rare earth metals to make batteries different than extracting renewable coal and oil which are constantly being created by pressure beneath the earth's surface...?

It's a rhetorical question.

6909 2018-09-09 23:24:07 I can’t lotion without gel oil! Or  else I’m going to be ashy ! 
6910 2018-09-09 23:24:04 I also think pads that soak up oil on are good for long flights because my face always feels gross after awhile. To be cute I also got the perfume called “the traveler” from Francesca’s in travel size because I’m obnoxious like that 
6911 2018-09-09 23:24:02 hmmmm New oil fired boiler, new damp course, new flat roof, new laminate flooring throughout, new guttering, new radiators, new double glazing, woodworm treatment.

6912 2018-09-09 23:23:58 Considering how the US has an oil surplus I have no idea what the 7 countries you pulling out of your ass are. I sure dont see Iraqi oil flooding the United States.

6913 2018-09-09 23:23:48 #autumndice submission sent after burning the midnight oil (not yet 11pm Pacific Time, but a bit past that here...). Balanced? No. Well-illustrated? Definitely not. But I'm pretty proud of my first proper game design!
6914 2018-09-09 23:23:35 So Mike Silver’s article called Kirk and Jay, “oil and water”. Separate em, and both won an opener for the first time. Kirk played well, and didn’t commit any turnovers. Alex ran Jay’s O like a machine. So interesting to me.

6928 2018-09-09 23:20:43 Exactly what you said. There is a reason, they are conservative and these tech companies are not. These companies and sites are the equivalent of creating internet safe spaces where only comforting like views can be seen or heard.

7023 2018-09-09 23:02:54 Nice.
7024 2018-09-09 23:02:46 The long tailpipe argument is totally bogus. Oil needs to be phased out from 2 places, burning it for transportation and in energy plants. On another note, the world is also looking to replace plastic bags and straws next. This will keep happening. Fossil fuels have no future.

7068 2018-09-09 22:55:43 Sick to death of the entitled Conservative whining today. Unless you lived and worked in the oil industry in the 80s like I did, today's AB economy is a walk in the park and stronger than Conservative Provinces. BC and AB leads Canada in economic growth. Both are NDP-led!
7069 2018-09-09 22:55:20 The US sanctions are what is causing the people to starve.  Send humanitarian aid and stop trying to control Venezuelan oil

7080 2018-09-09 22:53:50 This is sadly and obviously true. It’s horrible. Can you say why american soldiers have gone there. Why are the Russians/Syrians killing so many civilians? Is it all Russia’s lust for oil?
7081 2018-09-09 22:53:49 Or there is just a new sheriff in town—called the US which doesn’t need terrorists to supply it oil anymore.
7082 2018-09-09 22:53:33 @Justins I'm very disappointed by the palm oil in your expensive product. We went years without palm oil. There MUST be a suitable substitute that doesn't displace and cause the murder of orangutans and pygmy elephants. There MUST be something else you can use. PBcup=death.

7093 2018-09-09 22:52:29 Dear Modi Ji please saves us from d raising petrol issues. As d crude oil is $ 75 we are paying  rs 84.40  for a liter petrol. Have a solution for this rather than in 2019

7099 2018-09-09 22:51:12 If Canada gets half of its oil workers to identify as women, will we hit those elusive gender targets? 

Who are we to question what they identify as anyway? 

Would be a hard blow to the insurance industry however.

7102 2018-09-09 22:50:36 Right . Meat has been a really low margin industry and oil is a very high margin
7103 2018-09-09 22:50:31 Brilliant mate. I wish people were more open minded about cannabis oil. Well done on venturing down that road, I hope she's well pal.
7104 2018-09-09 22:50:26 I thought they put it there by accident. Many types of artists use it though, even the ones who make flavored nicotine vaping oil. That blew me away. It may not be used in sloppy slathering slogs like I joked about, but it turns out it's quite popular

7107 2018-09-09 22:50:08 Few drops of your fav essential oil in water in a spritzer. Does nothing for hygiene per se but on those long flights a little pick-me-up can go a long way! I also bring some cetaphil moisturizer for face and esp hands because airplane soap makes me so dry.

7110 2018-09-09 22:49:54 I support the Kurdish freedom, but not the freedom to snatch oil, nor the freedom to split Syria with the US. Also, do you understand the history of Tibet and the present? Have you been there? You want to split China with the US emperor? Dream!

7124 2018-09-09 22:47:51 many oils are high in erucic acid, bad for joints & heart. 
purines are metabolized into uric acid & excreted in urine. some purine-rich foods, particularly meat and seafood, increases risk of elevated uric acid levels! take Borage, Primrose, & Black Current oil to buffer & expel

7126 2018-09-09 22:47:39 The liberals did something remarkable in BC. They spent 4.5 billion dollars of taxpayer money to buy a functional 50 year old pipeline from a private company so that they could shut it down in their quest to phase out Canada's oil industry.

7135 2018-09-09 22:46:43 If you have extra tomatoes, my mom has good luck roasting them with olive oil and herbs, then freezing them in quart bags. They add a real pop to soups and sauces in the winter!
7136 2018-09-09 22:46:36 The first time I used my smoker I made some since I knew it would run hot new. I made a lot and learned that the oil isn't easy to get off your hands. Had a shower and was in a world of pain....

7160 2018-09-09 22:43:42 If you had $10B to invest today, would you put it in gas & oil? Most investors are not doing that. $10B invested today, for example, in renewable energy and storage would, over the next 20 years, generate for more than 20,000 direct and indirect jobs.

7212 2018-09-09 22:35:43 Just spent 3 hours doing a deep clean of my apartment/room, while listing to my favorite musicals, and then took a long hot shower with a home made brown sugar-olive oil- vanilla scrub! I feel AMAZING!!!
7213 2018-09-09 22:35:42 The #Oilers rookies lose 7-3 in Calgary. Tough night for both goalies, Skinner & especially Wells. 
Parsons in the #Flames goal played well.
Oil’s best were Benson & Jones.
Bouchard scored and looked ok. Bear was good.
Vesel had many great chances.
Others had good moments.
7214 2018-09-09 22:35:20 I really think my light broke. I dead ain’t get a oil change since November but my light ain’t on so ...
7215 2018-09-09 22:34:35 The people who set the oil drums in the ground have to stop doing this. Baby elephants fall into these over and over.
7216 2018-09-09 22:34:30 I read it just fine David.  POTUS himself described it as "treasonous".  Are you suggesting Trump is influenced by "leftist thoughts"?
7217 2018-09-09 22:34:29 I think that part where God said “ he anointed our head with oil “ God was referring to the  ladies... cos u guys were busy realizing dat u were naked in the garden of eden
7218 2018-09-09 22:34:15 Everyone selling snake oil
7219 2018-09-09 22:33:57 Surely this is something we can agree on!  Increasing government revenue from the oil industry hurts nothing but corporate profits and benefits everyone else.
7220 2018-09-09 22:33:45 what kind of powers will i receive if I eat a bowl of raw broccoli with olive oil and turmeric for one of my meals every day
7221 2018-09-09 22:33:42 I want pumpkin spice everything. Drinks. Essential oil. Bath bombs. Candles. Candy. Food. I cannot get enough of it.
7222 2018-09-09 22:33:38 All praises due to the humble pancake and it’s near limitless absorbency. And let us not forget the magnificent waffle, whose very structure cradles pools of delicious syrup. Which syrup is also lovely with some oil/thyme brushed on roasted slices of sweet potato. #TeamMaple

7224 2018-09-09 22:33:22 Oilers rookies lose 7-3.

The wheels really came off midway through the second. 

The Oilers created offence. Goaltending and defensive efficiency were the issues.

Despite the loss the Oil certainly had some standouts. Jones, Bouchard, Benson and Bear all looked good to my eye.
7225 2018-09-09 22:33:18 The NFL doesn't care....it just has an image to maintain...whatever that is..do they still have tax exempt status???   Just like big oil and it's subsidies?

7227 2018-09-09 22:32:52 Like it did under the Obama boom. When the economy was growing at 3.5%. Interests rates were close to zero. Just like the economy boomed during the 70s oil crisis. When interest rates went to 17%. You mean that boom. You do realize I'm being sarcastic don't you.
7228 2018-09-09 22:32:48 Would you give up your CEO title as an oil exec? I know I wouldnt
7229 2018-09-09 22:32:44 Jesus Christ you're escalating a damn field goal. You don't need to be intimidated because a girl is better than you at football. I'm sure you can fix a light bulb or change the oil in a car just fine, Juston.
7230 2018-09-09 22:32:26 We need to remove our dependency of  Middle East oil that is fueling the neverending wars that elitists in the military industrial complex, bankers & warmongering politicians profit from. #MccainLegacy
7231 2018-09-09 22:32:26 I used to dab everyday a couple months ago but then we got a dab pen and that was nice but it’s $35 a cartridge and we go through it in like two days  so we r back 2 oil lmao

7239 2018-09-09 22:31:12 OK now you're dragging me into another issue.  That was never my intention.  But, yes just because you are FF changing the oil in a department vehicle, and the jack collapses is not a LODD.  But, i have a dear friend that we started FF @ 16, he continued on to be a professional
7240 2018-09-09 22:30:55 Sorry, the oil didn’t dump out on purpose. It’s was God’s will.
7241 2018-09-09 22:30:54 Is this #panthers r.b. laced with motor oil or something?
7242 2018-09-09 22:30:45 Not to you. Clearly. The majority of people thought back in the 20s that the sun was a giant flaming ball of oil. Doesn't make it fact. Not saying fatties are the sexies of the future, but majority opinion =/= fact.

7246 2018-09-09 22:29:55 OPEC wasn't a positive example.  What's your opinion on increasing the royalties on oil production, like Norway does?  Norway taxes oil production at 78%.  That's a great way to pay for the transition away from fossil fuels.
7247 2018-09-09 22:29:48 So sad... All for unhealthy palm oil for junk food.

7250 2018-09-09 22:28:48 Are you saying that pro European People are putting out anti European junk just to get People to feel support for it. That's nuts, plus Europe does import stuff from all over the World. Iron ore, Wheat, Oil, Copper, TVs ect.

7255 2018-09-09 22:28:28 No, Blair doesn't want to address the issue, so I bring it up again.  Also, there has been infrastructure in place and the royalties collected have gone down.  How do we expect to pay for a transition away from fossil fuels if we don't properly tax oil production?
7256 2018-09-09 22:28:23 Lololololololol, the classiest bolo ever. Where's your cowboy hat and oil baron mustache?

7260 2018-09-09 22:28:00 Lol. Come and give me oil well.
7261 2018-09-09 22:27:54 Kitchen appliance that fries food without oil. Think it uses heated air or something
7262 2018-09-09 22:27:47 My husband said warm coconut oil 
7263 2018-09-09 22:27:26 It's clear they should have done more to address the receiver position. Offensive line leaking oil.
7264 2018-09-09 22:26:41 I don't appreciate their pseudoscience. The only reason why "diets don't work" is they keep buying from snake oil salesmen and expecting results, instead of doing the simple, but long-term, solution that's proven to work.
7265 2018-09-09 22:26:36 Hey there. I use it with a little olive oil, sea salt and make a rub for vegetables or meat. It’s lovely spread on cheese and crackers, mushroom risotto, infuse it with some olive oil too
7266 2018-09-09 22:26:26 my mom left a pot of oil on the stove and forgot to turn it off and like. it blew up
7267 2018-09-09 22:26:17 I tried to buy a bar of soap without palm oil recently. No luck. What I noticed is every brand claimed it used either sustainable palm oil or organic palm oil. I'm forced to make my own soap now, I'm so disgusted by the choices made by these business people.

7270 2018-09-09 22:26:00 I’ve been putting oil in my hair every week and sometimes even TWICE a week for two months so If I don’t have shampoo commercial worthy hair soon, I will die from heart break.
7271 2018-09-09 22:25:50 Just got done changing the oil in my dads truck and the cats made the job a little bit harder 
7272 2018-09-09 22:25:49 my son is addicted to sautéed to a crisp kale (cut up in inch strips) in olive oil w flaky salt. Takes 20min to crisp but he can eat by plateful. We go through 4 bunches/week just for him

"The Trans Mountain pipeline project would triple the amount of oil shipped from Alberta to export terminals in Burnaby, B.C., and result in a jump from five to 34 tankers traversing the Burrard Inlet and Salish Sea each month."

34 tankers per month.

7304 2018-09-09 22:19:14 I make a body scrub with brown sugar, cocoa butter, almond oil, and coconut oil. I might throw in an essential oil like chamomile or bergamot. Soups moisturizing and nourishing to the body. Is great for scars, eczema, uneven skin, stretch marks, and you'll smell SO GOOD

7307 2018-09-09 22:19:00 I guess you never heard of OPEC.  No, we need a strong regulatory regime from our government.  The rule of law can help companies limit oil exports.

7311 2018-09-09 22:18:17 Some good stuff on this in Malm's Fossil Capital, in which he points out that oil companies scrapped a load of investments in renewables years ago because they just can't make money out of them.
7312 2018-09-09 22:18:17 Companies that use palm oil should be ashamed of themselves. Their greed is endless. They will not go unpunished. Well, thank you for trying.
7313 2018-09-09 22:18:09 Don't forget oil.

7318 2018-09-09 22:17:21 Used Pataks Hot Curry Paste for a thick rub on some bone-in chicken breasts. Roasted it in cast iron on a bed of sliced onions and some coconut oil.

7327 2018-09-09 22:15:41 Both LGA are suffering from perennial flooding. Ondo state is an oil proding state with 13% derivation from FG.Ilaje is the only oil producing LGA in the state.Still yet the LGA is not enjoying from the oil money and worst still public power supply is a mirage
7328 2018-09-09 22:15:40 So censorship, suppression of outreach to followers, customers or potential of either is justified if someone just wants to make money?
7329 2018-09-09 22:15:37 Using a charcoal based cleanser or soap bar saved me Bc it regulates ur ph balance after washing so u don’t over produce oil. I use caolin charcoal soap it’s like $4 on amazon, they sell it at Sephora for $15
7330 2018-09-09 22:15:20 The lab claims of heat pumps are joke compared to real world seasonal performance. Better to be honest and say 2.6-3.7 still a 50% cut in cost& co2 vs oil at the lower end. 3.5 would be at the higher end of real life possibilities. (Using external metering)

7335 2018-09-09 22:14:53 Eau de cologne is the lower concentration of oil in the fragrance, followed by Eau de toilette.. The oga kpatakpata of them all is Pure Perfume or (parfum) it has the highest concentration.. #perfumeaddict

7343 2018-09-09 22:12:59 It is very clear: the majors started a cartel outside the US, but the majors were producing a lot of oil in the US and prices declined for every one.  By forcing independence to cut, prices increased for everyone. Majors did NOT cut
7344 2018-09-09 22:12:54 Bro this ‘ Coconut Oil ‘ got me over here looking lika some fried chicken 
7345 2018-09-09 22:12:50 Please close palm oil industry it's forest creatures all gone in the world 
7346 2018-09-09 22:12:50 Perhaps.  But the reality is, we are all tied to oil products.  Almost impossible not to be.  Is the reverse applicable then?  If you are pro pipeline and oil/gas, are you not allowed clean air/water?  
7347 2018-09-09 22:12:23 @SportsRadioWIP Phillies improved in a bad division to me that is not truly improving they got lucky and coconut oil got to go players minds are messed up they dont think kapler analytics thinks for them Phillies F for bad approach not good at analytics

7358 2018-09-09 22:10:36 I can also change my own spark plugs, do an oil change, and replace brakes/rotors  my dad didn't fuck around. He wanted to make sure I could handle basic car maintenance and an emergency situation.

7363 2018-09-09 22:10:16 An example of an already weak situation only needing a trigger - Venezuela relying purely on oil (that's the weakness). The oil price goes down and the country is in crisis.

7368 2018-09-09 22:09:23 I'm kind of envious. The spam friend requests I get on Facebook are in the vein of the 55-year-old man named "Smith Eric" who claimed he worked as an "Oil and Gas Engineer" in China and featured a photo of himself sitting by a piano with a single rose lying on the keyboard.

7377 2018-09-09 22:08:35 What does “sustainable” palm oil certifier @RSPOtweets have to do with worker exploitation? It still hasn’t condemned shameless #palmoil company @Indofood. It’s time to force @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s business partner out of the market!
7378 2018-09-09 22:08:22 No not mob money, I'm speaking of campaign money from banks, big oil and pharma etc.
7379 2018-09-09 22:08:17 i know it’s bad I’m trying to cut out palm oil but slowly bc I find it difficult
7380 2018-09-09 22:08:14 Bit like how City will never win 5 European Cups or even any league titles in the modern era without the sheik’s oil money....
7381 2018-09-09 22:07:45 So i bought this oil that supposedly makes me skin tighter and prevents saggy skin. Im hoping it works 
7382 2018-09-09 22:07:38 Time to beat Guyana. They dont want to share with their oil fortune :(
7383 2018-09-09 22:07:33 i just can’t atand being cold. which is why i’m in the tub and nOt showering. but also because coconut oil treatment.
7384 2018-09-09 22:07:31 USA is drilling for oil like crazy, in a host of States and I ask, “why would they need our bitumin?” Oh, I know they buy it cheap,refine to gasoline and sell to us for profit.  All the risks are on us...not smart!!!
7385 2018-09-09 22:07:18 Indeed. Do @theSNP really want (for e.g.) oil majors to pull out, no shipbuilding by BAE and Babcock, Hollywood studios to shoot films elsewhere, Barclays to move back out of Glasgow, and Diageo to quit marketing Scotch whisky across the globe? #ScotlandCanBeNarrowminded
7386 2018-09-09 22:07:17 A whole hour? After 10 mins I would have given up and used oil for my lips

7388 2018-09-09 22:07:05 Brett you are so off on this one. Building a pipeline and achieving less dependence on oil are not mutually exclusive. We want to reduce high risk rail transport will reducing overall demand. How is it nuts to want to save the planet. Your grandchildren and mine deserve that
7389 2018-09-09 22:07:05 Cheers! I hope Linda approves of them too. She's gotta be on some Oil of Ulay thing or she's locked a 1997 photo of herself in an attic somewhere! How hasn't she aged?!
7390 2018-09-09 22:06:45 You do realize people can be against selling raw resources and shipping jobs out of Canada and still use oil products, right???
7391 2018-09-09 22:06:22 I'd coat the baguette in a little olive oil or melted butter, then put some pepper and herbs de provance on it, and on the bird with a liberal application of salt. Roast with carrots, onions, potates, squash, and zucchini.
7392 2018-09-09 22:06:15 I need to make more oil before I run out!
7393 2018-09-09 22:06:12 Oil oil oil... if you haven’t used a full bottle you haven’t used enough
7394 2018-09-09 22:06:12 Gawd, you can't even get a hand between anything in there. You think Prius' wear out tires with their battery weight? A donut tire ain't gonba do it on this one if you were to get a flat.
Most likely requires the entire case of oil on that one. ;-)
7395 2018-09-09 22:06:10 i will commission @smileysilvie to do a recreation (oil on canvas)
7396 2018-09-09 22:06:07 Murkowski dont care.  Oil over Healthcare in Alaska . The Arctic Wild Refuge will be destroyed . Collins doesn't care either. Sold out

7398 2018-09-09 22:05:59 Ignorance, fear, oil and being lead by psychopathic murderers, who are in turn followed by psychopathic murderers.
7399 2018-09-09 22:05:19 I’ve googled Cater Page and see he’s in oil and was part of the campaign. I’ll read a bit more and get back to you on that point. No one expected Clinton to lose. I said “let’s see what he does”. I thought a non politician would be a good thing. I believed the “drain the swamp “
7400 2018-09-09 22:04:45 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
7401 2018-09-09 22:04:39 Please next time you can pay me to cook it for you. Normal stew or palm oil stew, Anyone you want
7402 2018-09-09 22:04:23 Tomato sauce, English mustard, salt pepper, vinegar, olive oil were my key ingredients 40 years ago.
7403 2018-09-09 22:04:17 Definitely some rose water to hydrate my skin and some type of face oil like vitamin e or shea nut oil
7404 2018-09-09 22:04:03 Sir Alan Duncan, you should stick to selling Oil, because apart from that you have offered absolutely NOTHING to this country.
7405 2018-09-09 22:03:53 Another clear message from our racist gop party, where ruthlessness rules and moslems are never invited (unless they have alot of oil!)
7406 2018-09-09 22:03:49 now we know  shit comes out of both ends
7407 2018-09-09 22:03:48 Cinnamon or peppermint oil keeps them away
7408 2018-09-09 22:03:31 And $4k for a quality oil painting is not outrageous at all
7409 2018-09-09 22:03:30 （*＾ ワ ＾*）.... Did you eat my chili oil?
7410 2018-09-09 22:03:18 Use of the wrong oil, even for a short period, can create permanent damage.
7411 2018-09-09 22:02:50 Birdie, you are ranting again.

If you think men don't do those things and you want men to undertake such tasks, then you need to learn how to top up the oil in your car.

Let's share all of the domestic tasks equally.
7412 2018-09-09 22:02:36 First or last, they are all cooked in oil.
7413 2018-09-09 22:02:36 My coconut oil don’t know if it wanna be solid or liquid these days
7414 2018-09-09 22:02:24 I thought maybe my son had gotten into the vanilla but nope. Definitely oil
7415 2018-09-09 22:02:08 Oil on water.
7416 2018-09-09 22:02:05 Bharat is not oil. Find better reason for bandh.

7418 2018-09-09 22:01:59 Only saw it for the first time just recently and couldn’t agree more, plus a wonderful technical combination of rotoscope and sixty-five thousand oil paintings. A real modern marvel.
7419 2018-09-09 22:01:55 Oh.  some kind of oil
7420 2018-09-09 22:01:50 Could you imagine being arrested for having a vape pen in ur car with CBD oil ( which is legal in all 50 states ) yup only in a red state cuz they are comepletely absurd!
7421 2018-09-09 22:01:39 @perfectketones Is it possible that y’all will be making a higher oil to fiber ratio like 80-90% and a higher C8:C:10:C:6 ratio somewhere in the neighborhood of 95%, 4%, 1%?
7422 2018-09-09 22:01:35 We don't need whale oil anymore and we don't need whales as a source of food! 
7423 2018-09-09 22:01:30 For soft silky hair, massage strands with coconut oil 2-3 times a week!
7424 2018-09-09 22:01:30 8,000 miles later I finally decided to take the 20 minutes and change my motorcycle oil 
7425 2018-09-09 22:01:25 Went to Walmart for an oil change. Literally left with a canvas, acrylic paint, makeup sponges, primer, and setting spray... Chronicles of walking around the store until your car is done being serviced 
7426 2018-09-09 22:01:17 U.S. politicians are liar
Important things for them are oil , money, stomach and under stomach.
7427 2018-09-09 22:01:16 I m not repeating anything else than what is there. The oil that is transported to West Coast leaves Canada. Costs more to take out than market price (industry figs)
7428 2018-09-09 22:01:05 Colorado Oil & Gas interests are doing big media buys in order to defeat sensible set-back legislation.  They are lying to you.  Vote YES on Proposition 112.
7429 2018-09-09 22:01:02 And that's only the beginning.  Dry it thoroughly, salt it, oil it.  Directions go on and on.  Good luck with your "find!"
7430 2018-09-09 22:00:50 It's like I'm being tied to the hood of a yellow rental truck

I've gotta gotta gotta gotta gotta gotta gotta gotta gotta gotta find a way.. to jump over the moon
7431 2018-09-09 22:00:38 Well I had time to change the oil in my truck during the @Titans game. I might have enough time to drive from Knoxville to Miami to catch the end of the game.
7432 2018-09-09 22:00:36 Rub some cbd oil on it and send him back in
7433 2018-09-09 22:00:34 First time using Olive oil to shave. Yes. Olive oil. Worked a bloody treat! Never going back! Legs have never been so soft  #girlstakenote
7434 2018-09-09 22:00:32 Got in the bath to it being cold. Out of hot water. Yeah fucking lovely. 3rd night now.

The only time I get to relax and just chill out I can't fucking do.

The sooner they get this new tank fitted so we can have some oil the better.

So pissed off.

7441 2018-09-09 21:59:54 I went to the eye doctor because this was happening when I spend a lot of time on the computer. Spend a minute a day blinking hard and fast. It will re balance the oil in your eyes! When we spend time at the computer we aren’t often blinking fully.
7442 2018-09-09 21:59:48 Yes i did! It is cavatelli with italian sausage, escarole and olive oil.
7443 2018-09-09 21:59:43 Try the oil wash I have in my toiletry bag and the night cream see if they help
7444 2018-09-09 21:59:28 there is not one silver bullet solution for bringing down an empire. we need everyone to get involved, from every possible angle of society. that's imho not only true for big oil. when i look at my own industry which is IT, is see similiar problems on the horizon.
7445 2018-09-09 21:59:26 Remember before #BharathBandh, Any rally in global crude oil prices will impact India’s oil import bill & trade deficit. Every dollar increase in oil prices will push up the import bill by around ₹10,700 crore on an annual basis. India is the world’s third-largest oil importer.
7446 2018-09-09 21:59:14 Put peppermint oil on my facial to prevent bad dry skin tonight. And now I smell like a peppermint hot cocoa from Starbucks.

7453 2018-09-09 21:57:37 $F seems to know how to business. But this statement bothers me:
"Sedans and other small cars are falling out of favor with Americans."
Please don't find a reason to raise the price of oil.
7454 2018-09-09 21:57:29 Ash the vast majority of women don't even know how to top up the oil in their car, let along know how to safely change a flat tyre.  You really are kidding yourself.

Let's see more women take on these dirty jobs, then maybe I will listen to women bang on about housework
7455 2018-09-09 21:57:29 I had a horrible allergic reaction to fragrance oil four days ago and I STILL have red, inflamed, burning and itching patches on my neck and torso.
7456 2018-09-09 21:57:21 No more Rex Tillerson. Rick Perry is a viable replacement on the subject of oil and gas industry....plus Beto O'Rourke is challenging Cruz...need help with some propaganda and cash to try to retain seat for GOP. Like @Discardedband  my educated analysis.

But where this gets 2 'I am' is when pastors DRAG Jesus' reputation
7462 2018-09-09 21:56:31 Yes, no shit! We sell cars and oil to America!  Our economy is aligned to the booming US economy. We knew we were to benefit since Nov 2016.   What about our future when the US buys cars and oil from Mexico?
7463 2018-09-09 21:56:25 Or about buying oil from countries that are heavier CO2 emitters than us without a tax!by the way tax is not the solution to emissions!If that was the answer then BC would be the cleanest place on earth since you guys have had it for a decade now!But numbers are higher nowadays!2

Sick of nazis marching openly n the streets, catholic priests raping boys, bn owned by oil companies risking billions of human lives and trillions of other life forms, no healthcare system, and going n2 debt for the rest of our lives for an education
7477 2018-09-09 21:54:55 Probably some oil related stuff.
7478 2018-09-09 21:54:41 I don't know what kind of meds you take, I used a soft product to clean my skin and I take a gel every two days that my dermatologist prescribed me +  jojoba and nigella oil the others days and it begin to be efficient
7479 2018-09-09 21:54:39 Nope, and I think I may look a bit younger than I did before. Being blocked my him is our extra virgin olive oil.

7484 2018-09-09 21:53:42 Those are useless. What a student needs:
- olive oil
- crushed chili
- a small plant pot of basil
- oregan
- tins of tomatoes, tuna, beans.
- pasta

With those ingredients (plus  garlic and onions) they can prepare a kazillion of dishes. Cheap and tasty.

7491 2018-09-09 21:52:14 When wiping on the paper towel to test if low, note the color, viscosity, & clarity. As oil ages it changes. If you know what "normal" is, you'll be able to recognize "bad". Could even ask the service techs to show you the differences between new, old, and bad & what to look for.

7582 2018-09-09 21:39:25 1. I thinly slice one eggplant and dip the slices in egg and then flour. Then I fry them in olive oil.

2. In a 9 x 13 baking pan, I make two layers of the eggplant, then marinara sauce, then sundried tomatoes, then capers, then mushrooms (if you like), then shredded mozzarella.

7590 2018-09-09 21:37:39 There are always short pipeline projects on the go in oil producing areas, connecting wells to feeder lines.  A truck full of pipe doesnt go far in the field. Never mind the dweeb who thinks that plymbers use this kind of pipe.

7601 2018-09-09 21:35:07 Bit 'over' but I used rapeseed oil as I didn't have anything else. I've never used that for Yorkshires before.

7612 2018-09-09 21:33:12 Sugar and evaporated milk - you could make fudge. Usually requires butter but you could probably get away with using oil as substitute.

7618 2018-09-09 21:31:54 If you have sensitive skin it wouldn’t be wise to use that soap. It has coconut oil, it can trigger a breakout. Try the tea tree range from the Body shop. It’s affordable, lasts you for months and it leaves your skin moisturized.
7619 2018-09-09 21:31:36 sexually empowered oil rig.
7620 2018-09-09 21:31:24 Skin care product companies peddling ad-words like: Black truffle extract, vitamin GGvc12, rocking horse shit, stone blood, cactus butter, snake oil, dodo feathers, quagga tears, etc... should be called out for what it is - total bullshit. #ShameOnYou
7621 2018-09-09 21:31:22 I know this may sound strange but it works. Look up coconut oil pulling. Lots of videos on this. It absolutely works. Take about a tablespoon or two of coconut oil, do not swallow. Swish vigorously for about as long as you can stand it.Spit in garbage not sink: can clog pipes.
7622 2018-09-09 21:30:41 After 10 yrs with CDN/Air Canada, my daughter left to work in sales with  the potential to make six figures in a high-tech company with mainly O&G clients

Asked her why she just didn't get a job on an oil rig if she wanted to earn that.

Her reply: "Are you CRAZY?"

7624 2018-09-09 21:30:33 Oil rookies down 4-1 after 2 and, in the words of my kids, playing like a bunch of “stinky Petes”
7625 2018-09-09 21:30:29 So you approve of Quebec importing oil from countries with non-existent environment standards or dubious human rights?
7626 2018-09-09 21:30:16 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。
7627 2018-09-09 21:30:14 More highways lead to more cars? Surely it's obvious that more oil/gasoline creates more cars. Just like more food leads to more humans and more crops lead to more fertiliser.
7628 2018-09-09 21:29:55 I sprayed every window and door in the house with peppermint oil apart from the utility door. Go to let the cat in and there was a HUGE one sat on the door  that will teach me for not being through back round all the doors and windows again tomorrow 
7629 2018-09-09 21:29:34 Bakken crude is light oil. What are you talking about?
7630 2018-09-09 21:29:34 Simple. The electric cars are only manufactured once, but the batteries last 500,000 miles, and then are reused in static storage before eventually being recycled. Compare that to oil which has to be shipped, refined, shipped again, and then burned.
7631 2018-09-09 21:29:08 Would you go to the bakery to get the oil changed in your car?  Of course you wouldn’t.  You shouldn’t go to a website that sells advertising for banking institutions and expect a correct credit report and score either.  Only the big 3 bureaus or a mortgage partner can help you.
7632 2018-09-09 21:28:44 It goes on the rack in the morning. New tires are in and while the oil is draining the tires will be replaced. (Stroking his fingers through her hair which he loved playing with.)
7633 2018-09-09 21:28:38 I’m innocent!
7634 2018-09-09 21:28:36 Had giraffes urinated oil @realDonaldTrump would have issued tough laws, by hook or by crook, to stop this massacre!!!
7635 2018-09-09 21:28:31 As you say, Britain already controlled her oil supplies. The Ottomans controlled theirs, and the Romanians controlled theirs. 

Germany was no threat to our oil supplies - only the Russians threatened those.
7636 2018-09-09 21:28:06 Peppermint oil helps nausea!!!
7637 2018-09-09 21:28:06 CBD oil has been helping me? I was skeptical and I'm sure it's not for everyone, but I'm not having panic attacks anymore, so might be worth a shot.
7638 2018-09-09 21:27:53 200K Oil bonds with Interest & 32%  State Tax is what type of loot...
7639 2018-09-09 21:27:41 هههههههههههههههههه شايف يدك مشدودة على الدركسون يقولون كان بينكسر الدركسون
7640 2018-09-09 21:27:33 They will drill you till they finish extracting the oil in you
7641 2018-09-09 21:27:26 I put orange oil in the diffuser.  The dog won’t stop sneezing and I feel like I’ve been dropped in a carton of Tropicana.
7642 2018-09-09 21:27:26 You can't out slick a can of oil, you can try but you might end up on the floor.
7643 2018-09-09 21:27:21 So my neighbour's daughter saw this perfume oil and I told her it goes for 1k but she can't afford it (she's 10).  She said, "I have money please, I've been saving with my mother and it's above 1k" 
Nope, I didn't ruin her saving experience. Save money my baby millionaire.
7644 2018-09-09 21:27:19 This is the most ridiculous argument that I have heard from sir. By this logic everything that India consumes should be grown (agricultural), designed and manufactured (industrial) and mined/explored (minerals & oil) locally. Let's compete and be better than SG. Thatsthemantra.
7645 2018-09-09 21:27:10 Lavender oil is great for anxiety. Love it. 
7646 2018-09-09 21:27:07 At some point it becomes more oil than chip
7647 2018-09-09 21:26:52 Algae oil (dha) is an amazing alternative to fish oil 
7648 2018-09-09 21:26:51 I'd also like to add that it's not just Big Tech -- There's Big Pharma, Big Oil, Big Finance and many other "Big" Industries that are part of the oligarchy to whom our elected officials are beholden. We need public officials that are accountable to American citizens.
7649 2018-09-09 21:26:46 Fearmongering......trying to use cultural norms/comforts to frighten vulnerable people. Snake oil. He needs a painted wagon!
7650 2018-09-09 21:26:31 サンルール、マジックルームとか使って遊びたいよね
7651 2018-09-09 21:26:21 Thank you! My main complaint is that my skin always feels tight after cleansing, even with gel/oil cleanser. Redness/sun damage. Even with a moisturizer and primer and face oil foundation tends to drag across my skin and settle into patches.
7652 2018-09-09 21:26:15 Here Is the Case that Oil Spikes in        "Fracked oil means that the well that produces it will die within months and another one will have to replace it, meanwhile the excessive use of water to get Fracked out, that water is always poisoned."
7653 2018-09-09 21:25:59 Coconut oil(butter?) Is supposed to help
7654 2018-09-09 21:25:39 The one that’s being created with plenty money for beard oil
7655 2018-09-09 21:25:22 Respected most Indian' are with you we understand the good in you but you will have to bring Petroleum Products under GST at 28% tax rate take complete price control from oil companies, prices hurt the commonman's pockets you will understand as commonman yourself @narendramodi
7656 2018-09-09 21:25:17 Yes you are right. We do not promote “vegan” diets, we promote whole food plant based free of oil which just happens to be vegan. No refined carbs/sugar. No animal foods at all.
7657 2018-09-09 21:25:08 But what can be done....for an old heart like mine.....soften it up with oil and wine.......
7658 2018-09-09 21:24:48 Realised I was out of my depth when I panicked thinking the wine list had no prices. It turned out to be an olive oil menu. #swanky
7659 2018-09-09 21:24:42 Believe it. And he’s also just fine with drilling for oil off the whole FL coastline. As is DeSantis.
7660 2018-09-09 21:24:41 @End_Our_Pain 
I’m keen to get to the UK & collaborate to educate health professionals & patients as to the benefit of whole plant extracted cannabis oil for many patient conditions. Medical Cannabis Research Australia has run over 50 seminars so far with 100’s of DRs attending.
7661 2018-09-09 21:24:39 Pls stop arguing with that man,check his handle,you know by their handles you'll know their pain.
7662 2018-09-09 21:24:29 Learning to use oil paints today during our Sunday Art Class! #sundayart #artclass #austinartists  @ Austin, Texas
7663 2018-09-09 21:24:24 True, again it's those qualities of humans that got them to this point that is causing us issues. Maybe we are only supposed to go so far. Once the oil goes will we have to level back out to a billion or find some other way to provide energy and labour saving devices.
7664 2018-09-09 21:23:52 I reply to you not to educate your fixated, one dimensional mind but to point out how utterly poster boy,  unthinking middle class dupe you are. A hypocrite who is utterly dependent on oil, who as a westerner uses more oil than 95% of the worlds population & pretends to abhor it.
7665 2018-09-09 21:23:51 1. Send me some chicken, please
2. Line your entire counter with shots of Oil of Oregano 
3. ??????
4. Profit
7666 2018-09-09 21:23:27 This is completely ridiculous. Some students may want to try their hand at creative cooking, but these are #NotEssentials. How about Sunflower oil, salt & pepper, garlic bulb and tomato puree?
7667 2018-09-09 21:23:21 a day and time  like this year 2118,none of us will be alive.We will be fossils and oil deposits somewhere. #MatatuMadness

7669 2018-09-09 21:22:58 Norway is not a viable example to follow though, because it has tons of money from oil revenue.

That enables the country to be far more generous than others that don't enjoy the luxury of free money coming from the ground.
7670 2018-09-09 21:22:52 Just follow the oil slicks...

7672 2018-09-09 21:22:38 Okay ya'll. I'm a lil bit on the hungry side (snackish). I have available in my pantry: Cornmeal, salt, evaporated milk, white and brown sugar, oil, and I think cinnamon.  No eggs or flour.  Every recipe I find calls for one or the other.

Help a sister out
7673 2018-09-09 21:22:34 Was it oil wrestling? Did anyone end up with a concussion? Because if not, I'm going to be thoroughly disappointed. #GetOnMyLevel
7674 2018-09-09 21:21:51 Easy. Non-renewables (the finite resources you lot keep talking about) are responsible for climate change. Shit like coal and oil, etc.
7675 2018-09-09 21:21:44 This is a damning report. HSBC is a strong financial institution and their report is spot on. 
This is not something to be taken with kid gloves, even the incoming govt has to work on our non oil sector. We are in trouble as a nation oh
7676 2018-09-09 21:21:43 Does this mean that knowledge comes with conditions, that first ya gotta read the fine print? Maybe Eve was conned--not by a snake oil salesman, but by the snake itself. I dunno, just ruminatin' here.
7677 2018-09-09 21:21:37 Gnight Mark, see you tomorrow mi young oil change 
7678 2018-09-09 21:21:33 My Avon lady just delivered my bath oil i can’t wait to use it 
7679 2018-09-09 21:21:19 Since so many of the products are oil based, yeah sure. We have some infused olive oil that has been used as lube.

7684 2018-09-09 21:20:55 Lol I’m dipping mine in a delicious olive oil/balsamic mix
7685 2018-09-09 21:20:51 He gave all the oil to Saudi Arabia so what’s he moaning about his family live like kings out there
7686 2018-09-09 21:20:49 GOP.  Working for Russia.  Probably a mutual plan to divide up Venezuela and take the oil.  Kick them when they're down.
7687 2018-09-09 21:20:44 The North is doing well for themselves with the oil money from the Niger Delta. Really preparing for that life after oil. In the Niger Delta they can't even get portable water and Ogoni Clean up has been a colossal scam.
7688 2018-09-09 21:20:40 I have one but I hate that u need so much oil to put in it..I don’t fry often but next time I do...I’ll take it outside. I know so many people that do it outside or in their garage
7689 2018-09-09 21:20:35 Head coaches should be required to oil up and wrestle to the death at midfield

Has a few electrical gremlins but hey the car was only 250 quid. 
My question to you renault is.... why is the dipstick so hard to reach for the oil? And why cant you service the auto gearbox fluid?
7692 2018-09-09 21:20:08 That was Lisa Faulkner. One of the original Spooks. Despatched via a hot oil fryer before the end of the second epi. But did go on to win Celebrity MasterChef to prove she can survive in a kitchen! ;)
7693 2018-09-09 21:20:08 Read the article, Ecuador had previously sued for $9.5 b while the arbitration found “technical work and environmental work was done well,” while Ecuador’s national oil company “during more than three decades, had done absolutely nothing” to address its own environmental issues.
7694 2018-09-09 21:19:43 Back to the "you use oil" argument.  Everything in our culture is made with fossil fuels.  That's the problem.  Expanding the tars sands is the exact wrong direction to go.  The longer we take to contract the tar sands, the harder the fall is going to be.
7695 2018-09-09 21:19:38 I’d love to rub tanning oil all over those bunz 
7696 2018-09-09 21:19:35 You don't need quotation marks around oil sands. It's a real word David.
7697 2018-09-09 21:19:29 Reducing inflammation is not cheating.  You wouldn't drive without oil in the engine.  Keep it going.  You're doing great!
7698 2018-09-09 21:19:25 You’ll be aghast at an area temporarily covered by natures oil but go to cafe, restaurant, workplace, or city to sightsee, work or enjoy yourself, yet they have totally obliterated the biosphere where they stand. It’s your middle class sensibilities that are disturbed not nature.
7699 2018-09-09 21:19:11 @altusepa @BadHombreNPS You're not surprised that this proud supporter of ICE Nazis and oil drilling in the middle of cattle land is buddies with Putinists who want control of U.S. energy resources are you?  #altgov #theresistance #resist
7700 2018-09-09 21:19:06 I would explain to you about the oil sands but your vegan tie wouldn't understand.
7701 2018-09-09 21:19:05 Today i accidentally dumped boiling hot oil on my hand and i am going to put that up there with being electrocuted as my two least favorite things
7702 2018-09-09 21:19:04 Too much oil - I love jewish cooking but its amongst some of the least healthy you can have. Everything is dipped in fat or oil of some kind.
7703 2018-09-09 21:19:02 My front door lock was getting REALLY hard to turn, like, grinding feeling and sometimes the key felt like it would just BREAK! -- I squirted some literal fucking vegetable oil, from the kitchen, in there and man, it still blows me away (1wk later) how buttery smoothe it is now!

7707 2018-09-09 21:18:51 Haha. You don't think those billionaire oil baron wives and all those beauty pageant queens don't have fake boobs?
7708 2018-09-09 21:18:35 Their rainbow dasher protected by machine oil slid into their slit of ecstasy
7709 2018-09-09 21:18:22 Now you went from The Valley of stupidity and into the land absurd. What will happen when pep leaves and the oil money dries up? Back to obscurity, but keep hating, I’ll just be here chillin on ice
7710 2018-09-09 21:18:15 Gonna turn 20 with coconut oil in my hair whilst watching Netflix
7711 2018-09-09 21:18:13 Tea Tree oil or start using apple cider .
7712 2018-09-09 21:18:12 And to answer your question, density is mass divided by volume. Less dense objects float above more dense object, such as oil floating on water.
Yet, things still fall if there is no atmosphere to displace them.
7713 2018-09-09 21:18:09 Years of lots of sunlight and sunbathing even in the idiot years of using baby oil to attract the sun says this can’t be why I have MS :(
7714 2018-09-09 21:18:08 Engine is just not mechanical masterpiece it is chemistry and oil combustion.
7715 2018-09-09 21:18:00 Simple no trial no nothing just hang the corrupt ppl, bring back stolen money, no more English medium schools (private), high tax on elite class, explore oil, tourism policy, ban on plastic, health insurance n long list
7716 2018-09-09 21:17:53 You can copy/paste lies concocted by white supremacists but you're a stooge. Without US meddling in Middle East since oil was discovered there and stolen by British and US oil interests, you wouldn't have al Qaida, like without Iraq war there wouldn't be Daesh/ISIS!

7719 2018-09-09 21:17:32 Chef Ramses cut up some live rats, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was some  human flesh, along with gravy.
7720 2018-09-09 21:17:13 Recipe of the day using butternut squash....olive oil, salt, pepper and rosemary garlic seasoning, mix till coated and put on grill for 25 minutes, flip 1/2 way through... very yummy!
7721 2018-09-09 21:17:13 I've watched a couple of videos on this. Does it matter how finely you chop the chilies? Do you discard the chilies and keep only the seeds in the oil?
7722 2018-09-09 21:17:07 Eww yum! I get it from Maisie roughly once every
10 days too, every other time a clog of fur comes up too, it's so solid it looks poop shaped ... Maybe give him the oil and then stick him outside? - does he chew on a lot of grass?
7723 2018-09-09 21:16:49 We wish you well. Try worldvision I’m sure they will take you. Also Talo oil company can be of help. God will open a way where there seems to be no way. Psalms 121:1
7724 2018-09-09 21:16:32 Any extra basil put in food processor with a little virgin olive oil & garlic. Put in ice cube trays to freeze then put cubes in freezer bags. I toss the cubes in my sauce all winter.
7725 2018-09-09 21:16:30 well damn. but isn't it a really compicated process of obtaining the oil from thw actual olives? don't you need some automated machines that will do that or something?
7726 2018-09-09 21:16:29 Going after the oil. Crooks all.
7727 2018-09-09 21:16:25 Curious how the President has used the word "treasonous" to describe the OP-ED writer ….

Perhaps you should follow him on twitter David
7728 2018-09-09 21:16:14 Check your Transmission oil this Sunday.
7729 2018-09-09 21:16:11 It's fine. So far. I'm doing a hot oil treatment right now. Once I'm done with my hair. I plan on filming my next video. What about you?
7730 2018-09-09 21:16:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, however revisit them.
7731 2018-09-09 21:15:51 There used to be an Indian shop in that wee row. Used to buy my joss sticks and patchouli oil from it.
7732 2018-09-09 21:15:48 The same could be said of tea tree oil. It works for a LOT of people and doesn’t work for others. I liken her advice to receiving advice from doctors who prescribe drug prescriptions and tell you the advice of herbalists is false because they aren’t medical professionals.
7733 2018-09-09 21:15:47 Started laying down undertones on an oil painting today and wtf who let me forget how difficult color was.
7734 2018-09-09 21:15:46 @jimmoginie what is happening with a new record and midnight oil tour. In the U.S. need time to plan Australia trip for shows.
7735 2018-09-09 21:15:44 Ex Oil Kings' forward Brett Pollock takes puck off the end boards and stuffs one past Skinner. Bouchard in front of the net didn't react quickly enough on the missed shot to get to Pollock.

7737 2018-09-09 21:15:42 If not I’m gonna buy 5 quarts of oil & say a big prayer before I push Patunia down the road.
7738 2018-09-09 21:15:27 I'm checking recipes and it sounds like if you get enough moisture out if it and use a little oil and cornstarch you can get nice crispy tofu from the oven though so PROBABLY I'm wrong and someone else figured out the baked CRONCH
7739 2018-09-09 21:15:19 tofu, silicon and dyes hair? Sooooo, we're saying that mop with a quart of oil on his hair really is black? Really? No Miss Clairol? We sure about that? Nice try teddy.

7741 2018-09-09 21:15:06 Karl please oil up your labia and pleasure yourself.  Your happiness is of no concern of ours
7742 2018-09-09 21:14:46 you might want to respect Callaghan then , he said the blame lay firmly within labour , not the SNP - then as we found out later Labour had eyes on the north sea oil prize to pay for its socialism.
7743 2018-09-09 21:14:36 We just cut up fresh chilies and cook them in a neutral oil - you need to cook out the water. Or use dried/pepper flakes and just simmer. A little salt and done, it’s a complementary condiment I guess?
7744 2018-09-09 21:14:17 #RoshHashanah SERIOUS QUESTION, not about Rosh Hashana, but about Chanuka: Why do we start with one candle and end with eight? If the oil had been running IN, that would make sense. But it was running OUT. From 8 to 1 makes sense. Can anyone explain this please? GOOD YOM TOV!
7745 2018-09-09 21:14:06 Coconut oil is pretty bad for your health tho. Contains lots of LDL cholesterol (= bad). Try macadamia oil. Tastes good and contains a lot of good unsaturated fats, raising your good cholesterol. This was also a pretty random reply

7748 2018-09-09 21:14:01 Psalm 89:20
I have found David my servant; with my sacred oil I have anointed him. 

This ain’t a future prophecy in the sense of being someone else OTHER than David. 
7749 2018-09-09 21:14:00 Should have said... It's the oil specifically he needs!
7750 2018-09-09 21:13:56 Not completely correct, the did get US controlled central banks in Afghanistan, Iraq, & Libya as well as forcing them to continue only trading Oil/Gas in US dollars. Corporations 1 Humanity 0
7751 2018-09-09 21:13:19 Bros while you're at it, Google how much Nigeria earned in crude oil sales btw 2011-2015. And ask yourself if it's possible for DAM alone to loot $90b.
7752 2018-09-09 21:13:17 This uprising against coconut oil feels like a move against the keto diet. Did the sugar industry pay for this study too???

7757 2018-09-09 21:13:02 Hard to feel optimistic about changing the city when the traffic commission only cares about cars and oil/gas and not about humans.
7758 2018-09-09 21:12:51 Ain’t nothing like a deep conditioning mixed with castor oil!! Yass hunni chil LOL Sittung under the dryer just letting it marinate 
7759 2018-09-09 21:12:46 I can! They're mostly whole, with skin (and some scales) still on. They look like they've been tinned in water or a light oil and probably still have spines inside?
7760 2018-09-09 21:12:39 Most likely has a furball stuck, Maisie has this issue too .... Give him some tuna in oil and it helps out... Otherwise stress if ruby's picking on him? 
7761 2018-09-09 21:12:39 What is mediocrity? Leading a country out of recession which was made more difficult by the drastic fall in the price of oil is mediocrity in ur book? God save us from people like u. If u must offer criticism do so constructively.
7762 2018-09-09 21:12:38 The process is well on its way. According to V. Smil in 20 years or so "for the first time there won't be a dominant fossil fuel." Coal, oil and natural gas will have more or less the same share globally.
7763 2018-09-09 21:12:33 I assume she’d prefer to use as little oil as possible & focus on renewables. As I would! Why do people feel the need to poison ourselves just to heat & light our homes?
7764 2018-09-09 21:12:30 called taxes wasted on lobbies for oil.  They should regulate money for that not  elections.
7765 2018-09-09 21:12:25 Yet the core values and priorities of the LPC remain identical to the CPC: biiions in handouts to big oil, minimum climate action, protect billionaire tax havens, allow pension theft, unaffordable childcare... The list goes on and on.
7766 2018-09-09 21:12:10 They didn't pay ekiti? Ekiti got 2/3 bailout funds, for Paris refunds and project cash refund and you say this dumb thing? Does Bayelsa owe salaries sir? Did they get refunds as the others, did Bayelsa get 13% oil derivatives? What can you say? Liar. Bullshit
7767 2018-09-09 21:11:57 Snake oil wouldn't do it... not even anaesthetic.
7768 2018-09-09 21:11:40 blue dawn dish soap will get rid of any stain, oil, chocolate, grease, wine, blood, alcohol, you name it. bleach is the only exception

7776 2018-09-09 21:10:34 Agreed Sir. The reason those sectors contribute far more than Oil and Gas in GDP. However,Oil and Gas contributes far more revenues. The reason it contributes less is it is seen as a REVENUE earner rather than Energy source. Let me explain,imagine we do not export Oil and refine

7780 2018-09-09 21:10:23 Are you insinuating dumpsters can't "think" for themselves? Not one that I've encountered sounded like they bought the snake oil, drank the koolaid or ate the shit sandwiches 
7781 2018-09-09 21:10:20 Intent on finding fault? I'll give you one. For 20 days obama sat in his i ory tower and did not visit the Gulf coast during the oil spill. He had to live e badgered by the press to show up.

7794 2018-09-09 21:08:50 I had some stuffed banana peppers today sauteed in olive oil and covered with asiago cheese
7795 2018-09-09 21:08:48 I didn't say dilbit and neither did you.
You have only referee to the transport of Ethical Canadian oil by rail or pipe as bitumen. 
My reply is to that. 
Nice try at confusing my reply that was directly to your continued use of the word bitumen.
7796 2018-09-09 21:08:47 I had the worst migraine last night. Tylenol wouldn’t touch the pain. I didn’t have relief until I used peppermint oil on my temples and forehead. Like wut.
7797 2018-09-09 21:08:34 I agree. Didn't mean to come across as harsh. Just trying to answer a ton of tweets and stuff on other sites and wound up being terse. 

The whole coup is just an giant s***storm right now. I think the RU trips are about oil; the election hacking doesn't need Congressmen.

7800 2018-09-09 21:08:30 Your so petit bourgeois, so alienated, you blanch at natures oil because it’s black and gooey, thinking the small area covered is a disaster yet you will blithely drive through the countryside part millions of acres of obliterated biosphere for farming and think it’s picturesque.

7805 2018-09-09 21:08:04 Just once I'd like to walk into a art store and actually find what I need. Matt varnish? Two choices, both for the wrong kind of paint. Linseed oil? 30. THIRTY.

7808 2018-09-09 21:07:56 Now that is a nasty thing to say about a used car salesman.  If you had said snake oil, maybe, but I’m sure there are fine car salesman on both sides.  (No I’m not a car salesman, but do own a car)
7809 2018-09-09 21:07:31 this oil diffuser i got has my house smelling RIGHT 
7810 2018-09-09 21:07:28 Yes it diminishes their argument. Because you can see they do not believe they just saw opportunity to make money.
7811 2018-09-09 21:06:32 Guys I just got out of Lucas Oil Stadium and our parking lot had about 75 cars in it and we all couldn’t get out. We were sitting there for over an hour. People got out of their cars, started screaming, cursing, and it was chaos. (1/2)
7812 2018-09-09 21:06:29 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.
7813 2018-09-09 21:06:26 I thought the citizens were to get their oil revenue on Sept. 5th? Then the 8th...
7814 2018-09-09 21:06:23 I put coconut oil in my hair everyday ... is that good Lmaoo ?

7816 2018-09-09 21:06:12 We are in the information era
Oil is produced by the decomposition of organic matter by bacteria, and each one of us with his writings, actions and behaviors on the Internet is doing the action of the bacteria by producing the information.
7817 2018-09-09 21:06:11 A good spend would be renewable energy, obviously, and on conservation and increasing efficiency. The money can come from phasing out direct and indirect government support of the oil & gas industries and animal-based agriculture to start.
7818 2018-09-09 21:06:11 Its looking for OIL
7819 2018-09-09 21:05:43 I need to stop fucking around & take my car to get its oil changed

7828 2018-09-09 21:04:47 mm ya? When or if it ever is done they still going to unemployed and most likely receive no benefits from the pipeline! If they want to have self reliance, perhaps they should invest in oil free generators with no c02 emissions!

7834 2018-09-09 21:03:57 Nice!!!! I was wondering about that!! We just do chili oil at home :)
7835 2018-09-09 21:03:42 There’s no intelligence involved. They’re all merely bought up frontmen for the oil/coal/gas multinationals, who have eveything to lose if we go “green”...
7836 2018-09-09 21:03:13 Your the poster boy for petit bourgeois simper, clueless, you destroy biosphere to make/live in a building but howl when you see natures liquid oil on the ground.
It’s just your prissiness, black gooey stuff isn’t clean & disturbs an anal mind.

You are right, extreme Muslims was already here. OBABMA brought that. Move to Venezuela where Socialism already exists. Wont miss you.

7845 2018-09-09 21:01:59 Spain would quite like Gibraltar. Argentina believes the Falklands are theirs; current disputes over mineral exploration rights in the surrounding South Atlantic will look like arguments over a children's toy should oil actually be found.
7846 2018-09-09 21:01:55 And the only thing the Venezuelan state redistributed was the wealth gained from oil. It failed to transition into a socialist society under Chavez and again under Maduro.

You petit bourgeois alarmists are so alienated from nature. 
Do you grasp that ocean oil seeps are known as biological “hotspots” because hydrocarbons are ENERGY which feeds & fuels the life cycle?
7862 2018-09-09 21:00:02 The difference between Ted Cruz and a snake oil salesmen, is that the salesman is more believable.

7868 2018-09-09 20:59:39 Maybe he didnt understand the meaning of the word or he deliberately wants to mislead gullible people,its one of the two
7869 2018-09-09 20:59:33 Yeah... the stretch of going from one week to two was a rough transition... but once your head realizes it doesn't need to produce as much oil to compensate for shampoo stripping it off it gets much better

7872 2018-09-09 20:59:04 @shezza_t @jonhickman - Interesting, I'd actually stopped putting oil in as I found it softer without it - olive oil is the oil we tend to have in the house. Today's proving time was about six hours, normally I do three - I might give it an overnighter next weekend.
7873 2018-09-09 20:58:31 do y'all really make your own olive oil?? like at home?
7874 2018-09-09 20:58:29 Nothing worse than listening to a snake oil salesmen who has no snake oil to sell. But he can remember how great it was when the gullible would flock in.

7887 2018-09-09 20:55:35 Made my own essential oil blend during this new moon in Virgo. I already know everytime i use this oil it’s going to be so powerful.
7888 2018-09-09 20:55:31 @Oil_Art_in_SC Thank you for the add! Let’s band together to get the resistance growing. And we can help take down @henrymcmaster and @LindseyGrahamSC!
7889 2018-09-09 20:55:18 So you think a small area of black is a disaster whilst you live in a home that obliterated the biosphere where it stood, That oil will be consume by bacteria to further the chain of life. When a flood obliterates a valley, do you simper POLLUTION then ? Oil is NATURAL !
7890 2018-09-09 20:54:21 Oh yeah. The rice, the oil and even how long it stays on fire plus salt. Plenty things can affect the taste

7893 2018-09-09 20:53:16 either willfully lying or unaware of Obama/trump executive orders ban trade with Venezuela?? it therefore has oil assets cannot sell and having international assets being seized?..which is it?..US 800lb Gorilla does not like socialists any where nr US #bbcnews #timeforchange
7894 2018-09-09 20:53:11 Get them fridges ready there is gonna be an oil spill in Cleveland
7895 2018-09-09 20:52:58 Left the bottle of oil in the sun whilst we were in the pool, come back and the bottle has distorted and melted 
7896 2018-09-09 20:52:45 I got the Damaged hot oil treatment, a Butterfly wrapped gift, the Mint bubble brush, & the pink petitgrain!
7897 2018-09-09 20:52:43 Palm oil to be more exact
7898 2018-09-09 20:52:41 Okay I recognize it’s a rare allergy, but guys if you’re cooking things and you put in avocado warn people there’s a non traditional ingredient so I don’t take a bite of brownie and then instantly vomit (then don’t say “but it’s only avocado oil!” Bc then I get to punch you)
7899 2018-09-09 20:52:21 Y’all my friends are precious! My life has been so enriched by each of you! Going to hunker down in the swamp!! A few days out but will keep you posted! Plenty of supplies,LP  range, flashlights, lamp oil, generator, chainsaw, food in the pantry and the canoe is ready.
7900 2018-09-09 20:52:20 The whole oil industry is based on lies anyway! did the planet expand by hundreds of feet to bury the dinosaurs? Did the dinosaurs all get together and die in certain spots to create the pockets of oil? how many does it take to make these pockets?
7901 2018-09-09 20:52:18 Aww, some black oil on a fraction of earths surface, she does it naturally & constantly. So does it disturb  your Creatioist view of a Steady State Eden, in some mythical perpetual balance? 
So when a volcano erupts and destroys, do you simper POLLUTION & tear your garments?
7902 2018-09-09 20:52:15 WARNING to the US-Government! The steps taken through Russia in the Middle-East proof the intention of the Russian government to take all oil countries in the Middle-East! The policy of the US-Government is PRO-Russian policy! It is as if Mr. Donald Trump is working for Russia!!!
7903 2018-09-09 20:52:10 i got a coupon at treadquarters for 14.99 oil change and a free inspection
7904 2018-09-09 20:52:08 @realDonaldTrump My husband brought to light. you told saudi to produce A million barrels of oil. summer is over, Going to expect gas prices to drop 50 cents Across the u.s. by september 23 ,2018...we the people would appreciate this greatly!!

他の食用の油脂に比べて酸化されにくく固まりにくい性質を持っている
7907 2018-09-09 20:51:01 Tar sands is a term invented and used by the oil industry.  Then they wanted to rebrand the product with "oil sands".
7908 2018-09-09 20:50:54 Maybe he should read through his statement again.
7909 2018-09-09 20:50:39 PSA: If you have an oily face DO NOT USE OIL BASED FACE PRODUCTS! I can’t stress that enough, water based products are your Bestfriend, remember that. You’ll thank me later
7910 2018-09-09 20:50:20 okay see yeah i am not driving it for a few months with the oil light on lol i just wanna know if i can last until friday
7911 2018-09-09 20:50:15 Went to the beach for food and a man told me my skin is glowing  my stupid ass gunna say “thanks, is the oil” 
7912 2018-09-09 20:50:07 By the time you say Second wi she would have put hot oil all over your face
7913 2018-09-09 20:49:47 A military coup to take control of all the Oil and other minerals that President Muduro is refusing to give to the West. Wow!! I so pray it fails just like in Turkey.
7914 2018-09-09 20:49:41 COCONUT OIL
/Coconut oil is a rich source of Vitamin E and fatty acids that help repair skin tissue, and keep it healthy and free from scars and marks
7915 2018-09-09 20:49:24 Oil by rail can only increase by so much.  Pipelines allow for a massive expansion.  We need to reduce both.
7916 2018-09-09 20:49:24 Netsol revenues are in dollars mostly so no impact of currency change since if dollar appreciates it's price increases same for ppl and other oil and gas companies
7917 2018-09-09 20:49:11 But mate to be fair, they are not building mines or drilling for oil. Debt is always a cheaper, preferred source of capital (interest payments  are tax deductible), than say equity (higher expected shareholder returns)

7920 2018-09-09 20:48:54 On top of the water ratio, it’s all about the gluten. Knead for as long as you can bear if doing it by hand and probably 10min in a mixer. Also, adding a small quantity of oil can help the bubbles seal and therefore rise without popping. I do about 20g quite often for a 500g loaf

7922 2018-09-09 20:48:45 Yep. Little under half full. I’m curious for the actual gate announcement. 

Also only $10.25 including service fees for me and Tegan. Beats the $29.95 the Oil are charging.
7923 2018-09-09 20:48:43 AN OIL CHANGE AT WALMART IS SUPER CHEAP DONT TEAR UP YOUR CAR OVER $30
7924 2018-09-09 20:48:35 It is effective for use on ordinary combustibles, flammable liquids, and electrical fires.  There's also metal fires, and cooking oil fires.

7927 2018-09-09 20:47:53 Yet if people protest these pipelines not just rocket fuel but oil they are treated like scum.
7928 2018-09-09 20:47:28 @joeblow745 @AndrewScheer @PremierScottMoe @JustinTrudeau is the carbon tax your way of making up for discount oil sales to our only buyer the USA because you are to naive to build a pipeline, yet you tank 150k bbl over Atlantic Ocean #truesjwarriors
7929 2018-09-09 20:47:12 I’ve been eating so much popcorn lately. And it’s not even like microwave popcorn, it’s stove popped popcorn with just salt and oil. Idk why I’ve even been obsessed tbh, but I’ve just been craving it everyday. I want some now, but don’t feel like getting up to make it.
7930 2018-09-09 20:46:39 By completely obliterating and shutting down all large oil companies?
7931 2018-09-09 20:46:15 Notice that most of the Moscow visitors are Republicans from states with pipelines, oil, gas, port facilities, or other energy connections.
And now this.
Makes you wonder, doesn't it?
7932 2018-09-09 20:46:08 Socialism has done it again. Even with the largest oil reserves it does not work.

But....

It was not really socialism 
7933 2018-09-09 20:46:00 The best dressing for damn near any : tahini, lime, avocado (option), oil, vinegar, a little soy sauce, garlic (option), salt.

7938 2018-09-09 20:44:46 Oh there is NO doubt Hemp oil has the properties to work but its NOT even remotely clean to produce !!!  Hydrogen is the future IMO but ONLY if made from hydroelectric power or solar , etc  Wave generation may be the BEST source of renewable electricity, costly infrastructure tho
7939 2018-09-09 20:44:42 For yesterday’s pizzas I added a good glug of rapeseed oil to the dough and it was the silkiest, spongiest I’ve made.

7941 2018-09-09 20:44:33 Intentional or not it is an effective psyop campaign at this point. Why would they inhibit the suspicion and paranoia this creates?
7942 2018-09-09 20:44:19 So many lies.  Obama added more than 20 million with insurance, longest period of economic growth, made USA #1 in oil production and reduced the staggering deficit from Bush and GOP.  You and Trump explode the deficit to more than 900 billion. Stop lying if you are a Christian
7943 2018-09-09 20:44:09 Just spilled half a pint of boiling oil and bacon grease on my foot and I’m in agony. My transformation into Michael Scott is almost complete

Yet the same people keep our oil landlocked and rails jammed full of oil cars while grain sits and rots.

7965 2018-09-09 20:38:47 How is filling Government coffers any wrong? In 10 years, you hiked petrol price from Rs.38 to 72, that's almost 90% increase and stole 4.5 lakh crores in the garb of subsidies and hid dues of 2.5 Lakh crores in oil bonds. Where did this 7 lakh crores go PiDis?? Who's Swiss A/c??
7966 2018-09-09 20:38:47 Vaseline and Colgate (original) white toothpaste.. Or magnolia oil
7967 2018-09-09 20:38:42 Seriously Socialism is OK? Socialism is political satanism. Carey hasn't a clue, he is just going along like that Seinfeld episode. He actually thinks Socialism is like giving subsidies to oil companies.

7969 2018-09-09 20:38:14 Do as hippocrates said. Let food be thy medicine. Go on a whole food plant based diet. Many have cured or controlled their illnesses. Especially those with type 2 diabetes. Also cancer. Many testimonials on YouTube. Also go sugar, oil, & salt free or very low. No need for meds.
7970 2018-09-09 20:38:12 Sure. And the best solution is to use Tea Tree Oil toothpaste, because this oil kills those bacteria before it gets in your heart valves

7972 2018-09-09 20:37:55 The only kale chips I've liked have been from this one cafe near me, and i think they get extra oil + salt and chili flakes on them, so it's really that the kale is a vessel for other flavors.
7973 2018-09-09 20:37:53 the NDAA after Bush, prosecuted whistle blowers rather than clean house.  His EPA & BP used toxins to coverup Horizon oil spill in gulf, that we're still paying for in marine life deaths.

2)Banks' withhoding tax: 10% shd be abolished. More money will float into the market. 
3) Oil shd be importd in gold,instead of in $.The more $ falls, more debts will decrease.

7990 2018-09-09 20:34:36 @CannabinoidC are you guys using full-spectrum hemp oil or isolate?  Cool products, I'd like to stock on the shelves of my store.
7991 2018-09-09 20:34:16 Oil is not dying for either the near-term or the the long-term. This is all spin to support the agenda 2030.
7992 2018-09-09 20:34:04 @geography_411 Specifically, globalization affect me right in my home of Texas. With Texas having on of its biggest exports of being oil, it depends a lot on trade. If our free trade falls apart due to the lack of unity of all countries trade systems, Texas will take a huge hit.

8001 2018-09-09 20:31:21 polish seasoning, it is called kucharek from tescos, lidl do a big big tub of it during their polish weeks. It is salty, but the right brand is just salt and dried veggies. It is surprisingly lacking in crap, like msg, weird sugars and palm oil.
8002 2018-09-09 20:31:20 But the real reason is MPs back handers from govt contract's to Saudi and a chair at the bar for last orders when the oil starts to dry up imo
8003 2018-09-09 20:31:15 The government of Albania has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Rupert Grint in a nylon wig.

8019 2018-09-09 20:28:50 Like I'm the only one who sees nothing that looks like integrity in buhari. Recession,price of oil stable on 145 now getting loans from china,the kind of money an average nigerian doesn't get a dime from. imo
8020 2018-09-09 20:28:47 I am confident that the companies that provide liability insurance to the oil/dilbit producers/shipment originators would impose new due diligence obligations on the shippers if this law was in place. At this time, the shippers are incented to squeeze the transporters' ...2
8021 2018-09-09 20:28:31 Notice how the rich Texans who love Oil more than God himself. Guess what Russia has a lot of Oil. Why these fuckers are willing to bend over for a few more dollars and sell out America The Iraq war was for oil more than anything.

8024 2018-09-09 20:28:04 Holy moly. Using ghee to pop your stove top popcorn is a revelation. Canola oil was my go to but this could be a new winner.
8025 2018-09-09 20:27:57 It is curious how leftists seized on this word treason as well as other terms/words using them inaccurately, creating new definitions.

8049 2018-09-09 20:23:34 Iran's democracy was usurped by UK (oil embargo and Operation Boot) and USA (Operation Ajax). 
8050 2018-09-09 20:23:28 Well, we have had no oil fired for nearly 10 years. Coal as I said is very minimal. So thats basically 2 out of 3. Gas will take longer, and they inject biogas into the gas grid, and maybe even H2 at some point soon. It wont happen overnight, of course.

8057 2018-09-09 20:22:13 Why would you want small vehicles built in America....you want gas guzzling, polluting behemoths.  But then air pollution is a myth and you want oil companies to make huge profits on gas.
8058 2018-09-09 20:22:07 I need to schedule an oil change 
8059 2018-09-09 20:21:51 That’s why she’s safe in promoting it. No company will build a refinery if it’s uneconomic. 

With this position she can remain anti oil, and claim that she isn’t.
8060 2018-09-09 20:21:47 Not to mention preventing new offshore oil drilling!

8065 2018-09-09 20:20:55 We were @DublinZoo Saturday and spent €41.75 in Meerkat Cafe on food that was barely touched. Battered fish soaking in oil, cool chips, Szechuan chicken served on cold plate and dried out chicken chunks.  Had to ask for cutlery as none in bins

8071 2018-09-09 20:20:19 Liberal had either chance for 8 years. Regulations hurt deeply Houston and Texas, Oil and Gas Industry. Of course, they will not tell you this. Republicans support fossil fuel, not Democrats.

8079 2018-09-09 20:19:40 Start with an obvious truth nobody can disagree with. The next step is to lay claim to being the only group that believes them and all others deny them despite being self evident to all. This bestows ownership of truth to one group and all others are deniers

8081 2018-09-09 20:19:22 Bought the book after seeing this tweet. You’re right, a fascinating read! I’ve been in the oil and gas biz for 35 yrs and spent lots and lots of time in Dallas, Houston, etc but I never knew how much I didn’t know about that history until now.
8082 2018-09-09 20:19:18 Join me and tell palm oil regulator @RSPOtweets to stop certifying rainforest-destroying company @Indofood now
8083 2018-09-09 20:19:18 Congrats @Rico_Abreu on an awesome win
8084 2018-09-09 20:19:07 No I'm not. The oil embargo didn't happen until years after Nixon separated the dollar from gold, and wages stagnated while inflation rose before the oil embargo happened. There's a reason it's known as the Nixon Shock.

8092 2018-09-09 20:17:07 I think it may take a seemingly endless chain of rail cars as well as tankers before the misguided activists realize there is no stopping the sale of Canadian oil.  Only then will they perhaps go on to more productive ventures and let pipeline building return to the real world.

8112 2018-09-09 20:14:57 Performance was great. No change there. But the repairs were  thick oil based. Which is where the heat heat heat and filtration filtration come in. But because it’s entirely DIY R&D all of the success and all of the repairs are user error. No corporations supporting it:-)

8128 2018-09-09 20:13:04 That's a great idea, maybe if we started in the 1980s.  We've taken way too long to do anything about climate change and now we are in a climate crisis.  Expanding the tar sands is not going to do any good, except cement the oil industry's control over this country.

Why do you continue to use oil? 
Why haven’t you boycotted it?
8139 2018-09-09 20:11:39 Trust me, this is what most of the Muslim countries want. Saudi Arabia is the cancer of Islam,The problem is that is USA and UK ally , it sells them oil and buys millions worth in arms. It’s all about money. Saudis sponsored the war in Iraq and the rebels in Sirya and Yemen

8145 2018-09-09 20:11:00 India imports 80% of its oil requirements. The cost of one barel of oil is 50$ to 60$. But we civilians had to pay Rs.75 per litre. Due to inclusion of profit margins by oil refineries etc and taxes by the govrn. Cant the govrn. reduce this profit scales and taxes?

8156 2018-09-09 20:10:08 Islamic Jihadist "Muslim Extremist Terrorist",  instead communism was an issue for western world + Middle East natural resources mainly "Oil", so, one evil like Jimmy Carter made a very wrong decision with his mate Britain, France, Germany and that was given power,

8158 2018-09-09 20:10:03 Just a little bit of oil, and... Come on! Come on, you little son of a bitch!
8159 2018-09-09 20:09:59 What you're seeing is actually a mixture of oil and crumbs that can sometimes form during packaging and it is not peanut based. Please DM us the UPC, expiration date with the letters & numbers that follow.
8160 2018-09-09 20:09:58 Funny, they look like com bloc AKs to me. Whose in Africa buying up oil right now? China. Prove otherwise
8161 2018-09-09 20:09:53 Today’s cool air marks the shift from coconut oil to cocoa butter //
8162 2018-09-09 20:09:37 Trust me, this is what most of the Muslim countries want. Saudi Arabia is the cancer of Islam,The problem is that is USA and UK ally , it sells them oil and buys millions worth in arms. It’s all about money. Saudis sponsored the war in Iraq and the rebels in Sirya and Yemen
8163 2018-09-09 20:09:30 And I heard a voice in the midst of the 
four beasts say, A measure of wheat
for a penny, and three measures of
barley for a penny; and see thou 
hurt not the oil and the wine.
And when he had opened the fourth
seal, I heard the voice of the fourth
beast say, Come+see.

8164 2018-09-09 20:08:51  you should, as oil is still gonna increase
8165 2018-09-09 20:08:33 My dumbass really was about to pour canola oil in my cup thinking it was apple juice.
8166 2018-09-09 20:08:30 this peppermint oil feels so good on my scalp
8167 2018-09-09 20:08:29 Dude...he is a snake oil salesman taking advantage of naive people
8168 2018-09-09 20:08:19 Ted Cruz is a shrewd politician skilled at saying what he thinks wil score points in polls and donations from big donors. Texas oil, farming and cattle producers needs California tech to thrive.  No tofu required.
8169 2018-09-09 20:08:15 That’s an opinion - I would put 2 and 2 - we were in EU most of your grown up years and U.K. crumbled / but then it was purely coincidental or due to oil - I have my own views- good luck with writing - Good night
8170 2018-09-09 20:08:05 bilkul kro discussion we challenge u to do so..petrol prices are not a subject related to dis govt only it has a link from 1947 till today.1. oil extraction capacity of india?storage of petroleum?steps to reduce consumption and other substitute for it.dalal patrakaro kaun degaans
8171 2018-09-09 20:08:01 Yeah exactly. They’re either idiots or are being paid to push the anti-Canadian oil agenda.
8172 2018-09-09 20:07:57 Don't worry about me, I know where the bodies are buried with your "snake oil business." Too bad you can't prepare for the take down. It will happen when you least expect it.
8173 2018-09-09 20:07:57 Just because Bob Woodward prints it, doesn't make it true. I trust this snake oil salesman almost as much as I trust Barry.

8174 2018-09-09 20:07:44 Good for Bum. No sense in winning again. This team is a 20 below .500 team pretending it’s not. Don’t give Baer and company any more room for selling snake oil to continue the ripping off of fans.
8175 2018-09-09 20:07:42 It's 1.30 AM in India but all set to burn midnight oil to #usopen final of #DjokoVsDelpo  . Del potro playing great and really big but nole is truly exceptional and heavy fav to win under 4sets. #tennis
8176 2018-09-09 20:07:30 New twitter handle, again sdlfjdsfs but this time its a fun pun with absolutely wild spelling- so "oliveroiyle" = olive oil!
8177 2018-09-09 20:07:30 FYI, there's a traffic jam ok n 469 near Lucas Oil Stadium, as all the "fans" bolted after that fumble. #Colts #Bengals
8178 2018-09-09 20:07:25 Kind of hard to replicate that with a giant drilling platform with your logo all over it that's spewing oil all over the place. 

I'm done here. You're an idiot and really boring.
8179 2018-09-09 20:07:15 ...that can help me further my carrier now... In the oil and gas sector to the specific or manufacturing. You get?
8180 2018-09-09 20:07:13 I've heard good things about coconut oil

8182 2018-09-09 20:06:55 We've got shatter, pre rolls, bud, cbd oil, thc tincture and LOTS more! Come check it out for yourself 
8183 2018-09-09 20:06:55 Irritable bowel, your gramma dropped acid and hijacked a busload of penguins, you have a root canal you're really looking forward to, laser enema treatment, you're trapped in an oil painting, the Golden Girls stage musical has come to town, Jackie stayed longer than you thought.
8184 2018-09-09 20:06:52 you just have to make sure the oil is 100% pure and not mixed in with filler oils to make it cheaper
8185 2018-09-09 20:06:46 Instead they want to go further in debt personally, increase USA deficit/debt by $70 billion to build & $150 million a year to maintain, which we know will be more, all because a snake oil salesman told them to be afraid of the dark and the schill in the audience is Biggs.
8186 2018-09-09 20:06:42 If a cologne and perfume are both made of lavender oil, the difference is in the concentration of the lavender oil mixed with water or water and alcohol. Perfume has a higher concentration thus lasts longer than cologne.
8187 2018-09-09 20:06:37 You’re confusing the hit to the economy caused by the Oil Embargo with Nixon’s rational decision to acknowledge that sustaining the gold peg was untenable given the costs of pursuing the Vietnam War.
8188 2018-09-09 20:06:29 In the forsaken land of OH. x_x The Wild Planet ones are okay but I've found skinless and boneless sardines to be dry and mealy most of the time. My local fave was Cole's Wild Sardines in oil but Walmart no longer carries them.

8190 2018-09-09 20:06:08 @bkravitz did the purposely make the new Lucas Oil Stadium bright green to resemble the old RCA dome or is it just my TV?
8191 2018-09-09 20:05:55 Lucas Oil Stadium is basically a second home for Cincinnati sports this year. 3-0.
8192 2018-09-09 20:05:49 ...if that person didn't share, no matter how little, from the squandermaniac looting of our national wealth totalling $992billion in oil money alone &over a trillion dollars in all between 1999 to May 29, 2015.
It's so painful though but you still have the right to support them.
8193 2018-09-09 20:05:39 Lol.

You that posted it needs to drink tea with annointing oil
8194 2018-09-09 20:05:21 On what proof do you base your very broad claim that Standard Oil never experienced a strike? I would like to read that book. You know, as a history major?
8195 2018-09-09 20:05:09 BBQ chicken fingers from purple pizza oil
8196 2018-09-09 20:04:55 Its like someone just let off the biggest fart in lucas oil stadium
8197 2018-09-09 20:04:40 Two droughts ended this weekend for me. Wow. 

First Kentucky ends the Florida streak. 

Now the Bengals end the Lucas Oil Stadium drought, 1997. (7 straight games) 

Holy shit. 

What a great weekend.
8198 2018-09-09 20:04:28 I hope the US stays away from this situation and doesn't go after its oil.

8201 2018-09-09 20:04:10 He's an ex addict and so am I. I don't smoke it to get high, I smoke it to relieve stress. Weed started giving me panick attacks after 15 years of smoking and it wasn't fun or relaxing anymore. I've been smoking CBD oil for over a year now man and I love it
8202 2018-09-09 20:04:04 A loud, resounding "Who Dey" chant circles around Lucas Oil Stadium.
8203 2018-09-09 20:03:42 The silence at Lucas Oil...music to my ears.
8204 2018-09-09 20:03:32 yes, i accidentally lit a bottle of valve oil on fire for a few moments. no, i don't regret it.
8205 2018-09-09 20:03:26 what do you feel?? oil needed for the tit fuck??

8207 2018-09-09 20:03:11 How many people are employed in the oil and gas sector?
8208 2018-09-09 20:03:07 God is up to something @goCanyonCreek Isaiah 61:3 "To give them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified."
8209 2018-09-09 20:02:59 What kind of things do you do for your acne? I have it HORRIBLY! I usually use vitamin e oil for scarring now that isn’t even working. I just started witch hazel which my mom says helped but?? Nothing helps mine omg.
8210 2018-09-09 20:02:50 Yo this is incredible, this oil or acrylics?!?!
8211 2018-09-09 20:02:45 How about you folks in the ME clean up your own damned mess...for a change...? We the People of the USA, are tired of being dragged kicking and screaming into your wars for control of that regions resources (crude oil)...especially since we get little or nothing for our trouble.
8212 2018-09-09 20:02:44 Tottally agreee. Send liberty military forces to Venezuela and we sell you oil at low prices.
8213 2018-09-09 20:02:42 You do know that without the guaranteed income from oil reserves that the rUK would be fucked economically don't you? Don't let facts get in the way of an uneducated, stupid rant though, eh?
8214 2018-09-09 20:02:28 Not so sure about the Falklands – it would mean giving up the right to potential oil revenue to the UK as a whole. And Gibraltar would be pretty reluctant to be subject to UK tax and corporate laws.

It would be interesting to see referendums, though, for sure.
8215 2018-09-09 20:02:27 There's still Hawaii Five-O

8218 2018-09-09 20:01:29 My man left you a truck so y’all wouldn’t have to struggle but you won’t work and wana take the truck across country but your ass won’t even pay for the oil change  stg ima loose all my patience
8219 2018-09-09 20:01:24 T-shirts are a day late, my new essential oil spilled in the car and the library is cloSED THE DAY BEFORE ME   EXAMS.
8220 2018-09-09 20:01:05 On the positive side, I would look to North Dakota as the state took steps to get high speed everywhere with some of the oil taxes (so I understand) maybe @katpinke knows folks there to talk to cause she lives NoDak
8221 2018-09-09 20:01:02 I held back on that. lol Yeah we're back to the 70s! When floppy discs  meant the record industry could not make real records because of the cost of  oil prices going through the roof... ask your grannies about paraffin.

The question was about fossil fuel money, the guy in pic 3 says the money came from lawyers and wasn't accurate to call it "oil and gas money" this is just weak 

Plus there's all the other donations
8224 2018-09-09 20:00:47 Since Eleven plays at Lucas Oil Stadium, when are we getting the Brad Ring statue next to the Peyton one?

8229 2018-09-09 19:59:45 Chinese roast pork. You know when you get pork in a Chinese takeaway and it has that luminous pink colour on the outside? That's supposed to be char siu. It's a marinade using hoisin, honey, soy, rice wine, sesame oil, etc.
8230 2018-09-09 19:59:30 Issuing Oil Bonds upto 2,00,000 Crores is NOT Governance. It's yet another Scam by Cong.
Funny of @INCIndia to have the audacity to protest their own crime in the past.
Shame on People who believe this Non-sense from Oppn.

8231 2018-09-09 19:59:27 The prices are the same as pre 2014, and now being used to wipe out the huge Oil debts/bonds that UPA I & II had taken. Use Public transport if you cant afford fuel. Enough of Whining #NationFirst & YES #saynotoBharatbandh. Now get back to work !
8232 2018-09-09 19:59:10 so much oil as well and the wrong kind

8240 2018-09-09 19:58:36 kinda sounds like something to do if you find yourself OUT of mayo. the reason looked: found an inexpensive olive oil mayo over the summer, but its a seasonal item. what a bummer.
8241 2018-09-09 19:58:29 I get an amazing changing view. I'd not lived up high before and it's like having a moving oil painting some nights. Big storms are good and the lightening has been too.
8242 2018-09-09 19:58:29 Whom exactly tomorrow’s bandh is against?

1. Is it against previous UPA govt,who took 2 lakhs Cr  loan on account of oil bonds & increased petrol price from ₹37 to ₹78

2. Is it against the state govt who get petrol for ₹54,add ₹28 tax &sell it for ₹82 
(1/2)

8243 2018-09-09 19:58:09 Btw 1999 to 2007 d need to restructure both our economy and political structures has never been as glaring as it is today. I see restructuring as preparing d country for life outside oil.
8244 2018-09-09 19:57:57 It's not a competition. Why not support a party that doesn't support wars for oil and imperialism? What is so hard about that? #DemExit #GreenEnter #NY06

8248 2018-09-09 19:57:25 Data is not the new oil. Once oil is used, you cannot use it again. With data, you can reuse, repurpose and continue value extraction. #data #BigData

8252 2018-09-09 19:56:14 A slick talkn snake oil salesman.
8253 2018-09-09 19:55:59 Also, my Dad is the chef in the fam. Taught us to clean, change a tire/oil, and how to finish a fight we didn’t start. Dad didn’t raise pearl clutchers.
8254 2018-09-09 19:55:53 It for sure is! Especially with a dash of good olive oil.
8255 2018-09-09 19:55:49 Don’t act surprised! That’s always been his format.

He shoulda stuck with Minecraft. At least when he sucked there he wasn’t being a snake oil salesman.
8256 2018-09-09 19:55:37 Oh wow!!! What happened to exploring Tourism and other forms of income like some countries that don't have oil....

8261 2018-09-09 19:54:41 Under the SNP it would be worse than Sharia May, their economic policy is dumb, they think they can live of just North Sea oil & high public spending, bearing in mind a portion of there budget comes from Westminster (Barnett formula). Also SNP would flood Scotland with immigrants
8262 2018-09-09 19:54:36 Apparently whale oil was used in automatic transmission fluid until the 1960s. What the hell?

8269 2018-09-09 19:53:56 and still, after all this time, I wonder what upset Jay more: the lone fact that I was drinking straight up extra virgin olive oil, or if it was that I was drinking it out of the travel mug he himself had gifted to me

8277 2018-09-09 19:52:03 This is key to putting a dent in fossil fuel. Everyday the world burns fuel oil equivalent fossil fuel equal to about a football field covered 5 miles deep. Solar and wind won’t get us there.
8278 2018-09-09 19:51:45 Also my gf’s family is telling her that the remedy to being sick is putting olive oil in her ear and if that ain’t the most Italian shit I ever heard I don’t know what is.

8284 2018-09-09 19:51:04 Yet russia sold $11B of Rosneft russian oil to Qatar on Dec 11, 2016. Only because Trump sent Carter Page to Moscow with message to waive the sanctions. Putin pockets half to use on his reelection. Trump gets 10% broker fee. Both sides happy. R is now the party of russia.
8285 2018-09-09 19:51:03 Get the hell out of here with all these lies. You only want to take over the park lands so you can lease to oil. Mining. Clear cutting. Open grazing where 1000 cattle come in to water and foul the fishing streams
8286 2018-09-09 19:50:42 The natural food store, where macadamia nut oil can be found but not corn oil.
8287 2018-09-09 19:50:17 What is India's domestic crude oil  production?
8288 2018-09-09 19:50:07 The lies of oil! Did the planet grow by 1000's of feet? did all the dinosaurs group together and die in certain spots to produce pockets of oil? How many thousands of dinosaurs does it take to make that much oil?

8290 2018-09-09 19:49:47 Oil is subsidizing your healthcare, schools, infrastructure just a name a few of the benefits of being Canadian & having an exceptional standard of living.
8291 2018-09-09 19:49:39 I rather agree. I was 23 at the time. Provincial UK has been crumbling my entire working life. However, I blame oil not the EU. Really must return to wrining. Thank you for a discussion that stayed the right side of name calling (just at times) :-)
8292 2018-09-09 19:49:26 I did. It looks great. Probably because I’m still in love with Hawaii.

8296 2018-09-09 19:48:59 By pretending that an ice age is happening now. Sure! THAT is a hoax!

The oil companies do a little bit of green happy clappy but their essential operations aren’t changed.

8299 2018-09-09 19:48:32 Last week I made an apt. with  mmj dispensary pharmacist. I told her CBD vape oil was not helping my pain. I left with strongest sublingual hybridol oil in a syringe. A rice size amount on a tiny piece of chocolate then let it melt in the corner of my mouth. 30 min - 0 pain 
8300 2018-09-09 19:48:19 4.5 ounces white flour. 6 ounces semolina. Three eggs. Tablespoon olive oil. Pinch of salt. Serves 4. x
8301 2018-09-09 19:48:13 I'm making chocolate with carob and white chocolate, all with coconut oil. It's so easy! And tastes great
8302 2018-09-09 19:48:05 So for your horses, on a long journey, you need to be carrying feed, shoes, tools, cleaning supplies, oil, replacement tack, lots of rope, etc.
8303 2018-09-09 19:48:04 If you apply an oil on your skin by accident or mistake that causes itching or burning, you should dilute it with a carrier oil instead of water. If you’re not sure what to use, consider fractionated coconut oil, which is a very common and safe choice.
8304 2018-09-09 19:48:04 The international community follows but their interest. Let Ambazonia controls the oil field and u will be surprise who will be doing business them them. Ambazonia is bless with all what entice the west.
It's a matter of when not how
8305 2018-09-09 19:48:00 Congrats well deserved!
8306 2018-09-09 19:47:58 I only realised yesterday at the age of 27 that olive oil comes from an olive
8307 2018-09-09 19:47:45 Might as well buy some snake oil
8308 2018-09-09 19:47:35 #UKOG LSE BB Swampies out in force on there tonight. 

Seem a bit agitated. Guess the police visit earlier has wound them up and seeing what's happening on site . They know those Crude Oil Tankers will be Galloping buy soon and there's not a dam thing they can do about now.

8311 2018-09-09 19:47:20 Let's review. Russia hacked the republicans emails too but didn't release them. Putin admitted in Helsinki he helped Trump win. On July 27, 2016 Trump asks russia to steal Hillary's emails and they attempt later that night. Obama sanctions blocked the sale of russian oil...
8312 2018-09-09 19:47:14 anything is possible if u have enough olive oil
8313 2018-09-09 19:47:11 Norway only started their fund in the 90's & they're now sitting on a £trillion oil fund, where's Thatcher's fund? Why DID she sell off our industries and reduce us to a nation of services?
8314 2018-09-09 19:46:52 Frogs and toads are the same animal! They just shapeshift!  Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
8315 2018-09-09 19:46:41 This applies to all aspects of life not sport only. I’m in oil and gas working for the same company as my husband and my husband is deemed the strong one for exhibiting the same exact qualities as me but im labels as the difficult one. Just F* this
8316 2018-09-09 19:46:39 Why are bras so bleeding expensive? “Because women’s markets are the most profitable and beloved dogs of capitalism second only to war and oil.” You heard it here straight from the horse’s mouth @BenGrimace
8317 2018-09-09 19:46:37 What kind of hike do you want listen? Check excise duty of 2014 and 2018 and see hike. Check crude oil price before 2014 and after 2014 and see hike. It is not your problem. You are just speaking what had you listen. Brother open your eyes and be logical. Don’t behave like robot

8322 2018-09-09 19:45:44 Russia got involved because they saw what we had done in Iraq and Syria and said were not letting you knock off Syria. Plus it has to do with oil and resources
8323 2018-09-09 19:45:40 @LexTheLex3510 changes my oil at noon and has a makeup client at 1. That’s a woman.

8326 2018-09-09 19:45:19 Don't forget to always use essential oil before, during, and after sex!

8330 2018-09-09 19:45:04 Enemy? Wtf are you talking about? So your saying saudi bribed sudan NOT drill its oil? What are the incentives behind that?
8331 2018-09-09 19:45:00 I’ve seen some say you can use anything, others say olive oil, others say coconut oil, it’s random.
8332 2018-09-09 19:44:49 Two things I learned from making #parotta at home this weekend:
1. Don't scrimp on the oil to make it healthy. It's just not parotta at that point.
2. Don't wear new clothes. Even if it's a pyjama. You end up wearing the oil with all the flipping.

8334 2018-09-09 19:43:44 PAl you better do some homework !!  The processing of your HEMP takes BIG time energy to get your OIL to a state where it can be useful . Plus it is NOT an easy  or cheap crop to handle , harvest , store & transport

8342 2018-09-09 19:42:13 That’s one thing I agree with @ElizabethMay open more refineries, in the past few decades 20 or so have closed, just re-open a couple and create stable jobs for the oil industry @ctvqp #cdnpoli #abpoli @JustinTrudeau

8346 2018-09-09 19:41:48 Scattered Curiosity: Chainsaws were invented in the 1800s and were initially used for surgery. An average chainsaw goes 60 miles per hour and can be lubricated with vegetable oil. Famously used by lumberjacks there are also chainsaws capable of cutting concrete and brick. 
8347 2018-09-09 19:41:30 I had to learn to make them when we lived in America as no Aunt Bessie there. Set the oven on fire as put too much oil in the tins 
8348 2018-09-09 19:41:26 2014-17: ↑ taxes on oil.↑ revenue 4 govt. CAD & Fiscal deficit targets achieved. ↑ revenue leads to ↑public spending which compensate for lack of private invstmt.(NPA-Twin BS). 
Now: High prices pinches public. Taxes can't b reduce as it will lead to inflation.(Missed CAD).

8351 2018-09-09 19:41:12 John Kerry just said it tonight on Fareed Zakaria and it is soo true. America isn't Americaing as before. America created the oil industry, the steel industry, the transportation industry, and the technology industry. But now, it isn't doing that anymore. America isn't Americaing
8352 2018-09-09 19:40:56 just kind of looks like you have an old oil painting on the wall lol.
8353 2018-09-09 19:40:56 If you feel anxiety, try the 4-7-8 technique. I do this (esp for meditation) + my oil.  Hope ya feel better jjamps!
8354 2018-09-09 19:40:50 The other half of my family is Italian - I have heard similar statements.  I have recipes from my grandparents - on both sides - that just say “a bit if oil,” enough garlic,” “cinnamon” and “you’ll know what’s needed.” Its just all feelings and muscle memory.
8355 2018-09-09 19:40:22 If buying a car only cares about the price of oil from the beginning, I believe no one will choose to drive a V12 engine car.

8357 2018-09-09 19:40:04 There’s this clear coat enhanced with garlic, which works wonders or empty out a half a bottle of clear coat, take a garlic clove, cut it up, throw them inside and add half a teaspoon of olive oil.
8358 2018-09-09 19:39:45 And who is going to put a stop to billions flying away everyday through hawala. You plug the leak in your tank first before recovering the oil lost to spill

8367 2018-09-09 19:37:40 My dad wouldn’t let me drive til I knew how to change the oil, filters and plugs never mind change a wheel aged 17
8368 2018-09-09 19:37:37 No. you're the one asserting lies without facts. Just because a lie is "common knowledge" doesn't make it any less a lie. Standard Oil never jacked up prices. They only lowered prices, which other  companies were upset about, and called "predatory" because they couldn't keep up.
8369 2018-09-09 19:37:37 I mean, this is pretty accurate.
Corn fed boys, girls who want to be vets, college rivalry between OSU and OU, and oil field money, boots, and trucks.
8370 2018-09-09 19:37:29 Zerohedge, I realize you need to stir up readers with your tweets but this is shit journalism.   The seeds of the financial crisis were created after 9/11 when interest rates had to be dropped to restore business confidence.  It was rising oil prices that triggered the collapse.
8371 2018-09-09 19:37:13 Don’t worry Indianapolis, the only winning team in Lucas Oil, @IndyEleven, plays at home on September 26
8372 2018-09-09 19:37:10 Cures are just as feasible to find in modern research as these stupid lifetime treatments. A cure for diabetes would cost billions a year for med and pharm. Treatment makes them billions. Do you really think the med pharm industry has any more morality tham big oil. think again.

Only yes.
8377 2018-09-09 19:36:39 Obama is a combination of used car salesman and snake oil salesman.  He’s always taken credit.  Just like Agent Smith in the Matrix, Me Me Me....

8394 2018-09-09 19:35:05 Leaving ISIS alone is not the same as discontinuing the exploitation and occupation of the Middle East. ISIS is a symptom of the decades-long campaign of destabilization by the US for control over oil. Maybe they’d go away if the CIA stopped funding right-wing terrorist groups.
8395 2018-09-09 19:34:39 Buy expensive olive oil, thank me later

8404 2018-09-09 19:33:05 water as it is the most abundant element in the world. They wouldn't even have to go out & drill for it. Think about the mass of energy that could be produced from just extracting hydrogen from the sea. That way transport like planes, ships, lorries etc could move away from oil.
8405 2018-09-09 19:32:46 @realDonaldTrump 
California Gov. Jerry Brown signs new laws blocking President Trump’s plan to expand offshore oil drilling along the state’s coast
8406 2018-09-09 19:32:41 Don't blame them for refused Ng entry to site. BBC and you're Channel4 news friends are completely biased. Better watching Fool News . Fool News is against the import of oil . A hazard to our beautiful Oceans .
8407 2018-09-09 19:32:39 This may be a stupid question Angel but have you tried medical marijuana in pill form? It’s the oil from the canibus, there’s no “high” involved. I know friends that have changed their life while suffering from very crippling diseases by using the canibus. Stay strong for him.

8411 2018-09-09 19:31:50 Like an old time snake oil salesman, Carlson and scammers like him convince guillable people of imaginary problems/fears so they can sell their fake bullshit remedy. If the chief snake oil salesman (Trump) is vanquished the others will crawl back in their holes!
8412 2018-09-09 19:31:48 Being patriotic about the tar sands isn't going to reduce emissions.  Reducing oil production will.
8413 2018-09-09 19:31:31 So Cryin Cruz is whining about silicone and hair dye. So petroleum based products he is against. Does he not know that Texas produces a lot of petroleum. he is against he is against big oil. He believes in Climate change after all. he is all yours.
8414 2018-09-09 19:31:12 This is the guy that thought increasing US oil & gas production was going to fix the disaster in profits caused by OPEC’s glut of cheap oil driving crude prices below $45/barrel. Perry doesn’t get simple supply and demand.
Great for all sectors of the economy except oil&gas.

8420 2018-09-09 19:30:15 How much do you depend on your car, When was the last time you changed the oil? Oil & Filter changes from £64.95
8421 2018-09-09 19:30:07 So your argument is based on imagining that the only oil in the world comes from the oi sands? Good to know. In the real world oil from the oil sands gets replaced by oil from Nigeria, Algeria, Tunisia, Iran. Saudi Arabia etc... so there is no net change in emissions
8422 2018-09-09 19:30:06 @Lucas_Oil Hello, quick question. Does your fuel treatment expire? I found a bottle that had been in my garage for many years. Should I dispose of it to be safe? Thank you.
8423 2018-09-09 19:30:00 Russia with their land mass must have vast reserves of oil compared to the US...wonder who will run out first? But Russia has built several of the worlds most powerful ice breakers and will have several more in a few years.
8424 2018-09-09 19:29:56 Charge CA higher oil tax.
8425 2018-09-09 19:29:56 Check the fires this summer, global warming maybe? Sea levels rising and you back dirty oil for jobs. Think long term, cars will not be the future nor oil, change is tough but so is destruction! #cdnpoli #alberta #bcpoli #Sask
8426 2018-09-09 19:29:37 just so you know, P.T. Barnum, it's his quote...and you are correct, trump the con-man, the huckster, the grifter, the snake-oil-salesman can't hold a candle to Barnum.
8427 2018-09-09 19:29:37 Aw my older cousin heard my mom talking about my anxiety the other day so rn she gave me hemp oil and cbd gummies and told me about how much she’s tried to help my lil neice with her anxiety 
8428 2018-09-09 19:29:09 You are better than CoQ10 and Fish oil.
8429 2018-09-09 19:29:06 You can hear the debate about oil drilling by listening to both an oil company, or the Minister for Economic development, and Greenpeace or a Green MP, for example.
8430 2018-09-09 19:28:23 Well, she’s not exactly an oil painting herself, and she needs a decent fitting bra. Decent clothes and glasses too, in fact she needs a full make over and maybe some proper meds.
8431 2018-09-09 19:28:03 Uno u can bleach ur hair safely to not ruin ur hair by drenching ur hair in coconut oil an hour or two before u do it??? I bleached mine twice and didnt damage it at all
8432 2018-09-09 19:27:55 Keep calling.  The squeaky wheel gets the oil.  Maybe they will get tired of the calls and move.  Good luck.  Bad neighbors can make your life miserable.  I know.
8433 2018-09-09 19:27:50 Their are segments where imports are a necessity eg energy, others where it can be reduced eg food products like palm oil, mobile phones etc whereas it shld be boycotted where it effects our local products like textiles, dairy products, automobiles etc.
8434 2018-09-09 19:27:35 Yo prefiero Sonic & Knuckles, sobre todo la parte de &Knuckles Básicamente porque me gustan más las ambientaciones de las fases y porque el Sonic 2 de Megadrive no me gusta mucho y Mania tiene Oil Ocean y demás
8435 2018-09-09 19:27:35 I love robotic oil poffins~!
8436 2018-09-09 19:27:28 Keep up with those logical fallacies, you are consistently proving how ridiculous you really are using technology composed from oil products while disparaging it. Do your kids ask you why you say 1 thing but do the opposite?
8437 2018-09-09 19:27:26 Of course this is no longer the case as Venezuela has been strangled by sanctions and the oil glut and oil prices are now rising back to the crippling levels that help to keep this nations fucked.

8443 2018-09-09 19:26:57 Trump Giuliani & big oil, Russia? : true conspirators/benefactors* behind 9-11!
8444 2018-09-09 19:26:49 Its all greek: lemon, oregano, garlic, and olive oil.  Looking forward to tomorrow!
8445 2018-09-09 19:26:44 Maybe the government will clean that mess up if they receive money from oil revenues if they allow that pipeline to be built.
8446 2018-09-09 19:26:35 That is very important. I won't vote for anyone who has taken pharma (or oil/coal) money, if there is another option.
8447 2018-09-09 19:26:20 “Kerbo I need your help idk how to check my oil” 
8448 2018-09-09 19:26:16 Yes, we have an oil Aga too Pat. It’s only put on at Christmas & stays on for about 4 months. It’s ssooooo expensive to run but we do love it. Its a living thing. I have an electric oven too for daily use....so currently covering all eventualities!!  
8449 2018-09-09 19:26:10 "I will only impart information that will benefit us all if I can make money from it"
 Yep.
Totally not snake oil.
8450 2018-09-09 19:26:04 Obviously cheap oil is crucial for a nation trying to develop its infrastructure. It was the oil embargo of the 1970s which helped kick off the various crises in Central America so to be able to benefit from a program like that cannot be understated.
8451 2018-09-09 19:26:02 Was the threats against Russia oil interests  just a smoke screen. Remember the Exxon /Russian oil deal. Well is it back on?
8452 2018-09-09 19:26:02 Thanks Drew! Oil and gas (Chinese purchases influence Russian policy which is an O&G export economy) The 'belt' refers to the overland interconnecting infrastructure corridors; the Silk Road Economic Belt (SREB) component.
8453 2018-09-09 19:25:57 I’m still transitioning my hair so it’s been hard for me to find stuff that works with my 3 different textures. I started using ogx miracle oil conditioner and haven’t looked back.
8454 2018-09-09 19:25:54 Just organic unprocessed virgin coconut oil and pure organic grade A shea butter

8458 2018-09-09 19:25:33 Warren got President Soetoro to halt Keystone so that oil still had to transport on Warren’s railroad.  He’s an insider crony capitalist.
8459 2018-09-09 19:25:20 Why don't we understand A better doctor who he worship will handle the patient better than others. We need experts to diagnose problems and cure them. We don't want bad doctors, hate preachers. Spreading hate has given birth to extremism we are burning and pouring kerosene oil

8461 2018-09-09 19:25:14 good to see you back in the winner circle!!!!! Congratulations!!!
8462 2018-09-09 19:25:14 Oh yeah of course. One of the best examples I can provide of that is PetroCaribe. Venezuela’s discount oil program for Central American and Caribbean nations. It forced even right wing nations (at the time) like El Salvador and Honduras to consider becoming allies (some died) and
8463 2018-09-09 19:25:12 Does it have to be coconut oil...
8464 2018-09-09 19:25:11 He stole my anointing oil
8465 2018-09-09 19:24:57 Mom: “I went to wash off the leather wipe oil from my hands with soap..& I remembered that.. I am leather”

8466 2018-09-09 19:24:56 Thank you. Having an awesome agent and partner helps oil the rails of this long track, for sure!

8468 2018-09-09 19:24:24 @europefreeradio 
I ENGAGED IN A TRADE IN CRUDE OIL FUTURES CONTRACT TWO OF THEM IN 1987. I HAD A SURPLUS OF $1560 FROM I BELIEVE A $2000 OR $4000 CORPUS. SINCE I DID NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT PUT AT RISK, DID I MAKE A PROFIT? NO. IT WAS A NICE UP MOVEMENT; NOT THE CURRENT CONTRACT.
8469 2018-09-09 19:24:12 No Homo Bill, but I do have to admit... when you oil up those Bodacious moobs of yours... it makes me feel some type of way. 
8470 2018-09-09 19:24:10 The Justice Department needs too read up on Standard Oil.  That might give them some tips on doing something but I’m not holding my breath.
8471 2018-09-09 19:24:05 Weigh out six pinches of olive oil and bring to a boil.

8474 2018-09-09 19:23:45 I'm I the only one feeling like Nigeria has given all oil rights to China as a move to create free access to loan facility move?  And they are not going to build refineries 
8475 2018-09-09 19:23:35 I also need to go get my oil changed but ion feel like doing that either
8476 2018-09-09 19:23:23 Try it with avocado oil!!! 
8477 2018-09-09 19:23:21 Now we need to make it vegan and reduce oil/refined carbs, focus on whole plant foods. Then we will be doing the right thing.
8478 2018-09-09 19:23:11 My coconut oil finally solidified happy fall y’all
8479 2018-09-09 19:23:08 Cover it all with a coat of flat oil paint , no need for expensive zinseer paint. Be fine then to finish with emulsion.
8480 2018-09-09 19:23:06 I find him to be a very smug snake oil salesmen who claims to work for the best interest of our country but in reality he wants the exact opposite. It's a shame he ever held office
8481 2018-09-09 19:23:05 Olive oil works for sure
8482 2018-09-09 19:22:43 I can tell when Mean Cook is attracted to someone working in restaurant by how kind or mean she is to me. 
When no guys, she sometimes cooks my favourite soup. When super handsome guy, she'll throw stuff in deep fryer when I'm nearby so I get burned by the oil droplets

8492 2018-09-09 19:21:06 Crude oil price increasing!!! 
Is it not a worse excuse ever we seen.crude oil price are decreasing in comparison to the Congress period and oil prices are increasing in comparison to them... I think the petrol/diesel and the crude oil are reciprocal to each other
8493 2018-09-09 19:21:04 I’ve started using garlic in my part-time magic act. 

First I start by crushing it, adding basil and some pine nuts, and then I blend them altogether with some Parmesan and olive oil...

Then, hey... pesto!
8494 2018-09-09 19:21:01 Okay, I put them in lastnight. I reoiled my scalp this morning. I‘ll keep them in again tonight then. Moisturize with oil or cremè

8496 2018-09-09 19:20:26 The treatment is the Extreme oil and the Holy oil. Both cannabis based. Extreme oil stops addiction and pain on the 1st dose. Holy oil cures from the inside and stops cravings. No withdrawls, you just lose interest in it. We have worked on this for 2 1/2 years. PM me.

8506 2018-09-09 19:19:17 Who raised the price from 60 to 80 then accuse the @BJP4India. If the oil price under Cong is high, BJP regime also face international currency fluctuation by some countries. The point here should who has guts 2 reduce d price and @RajasthanCm have it. Can Cong do in Karnataka?
8507 2018-09-09 19:19:16 The difference with $MDXG is that there are many more indications of a quid pro quo, with paid doctors overusing products, billing medicare for it, and hawking unapproved and insufficiently-tested snake oil to patients and the public

8514 2018-09-09 19:18:35 You kid yourself if you think there’s any such thing as free trade. Government always puts their hands on the scale. Subsidies for farmers, subsidies for the oil industry. Tax breaks for research. And if you think this admin is any different, I’ll remind you of the 12bil package.

8531 2018-09-09 19:16:19 What's most interesting is this issue of timing. I think it's closer than you do Brent, but even suggesting any specific timeframe is Quixotic. The marked change in rhetoric among leaders east of the Atlantic of late is v notable though as are ongoing non$ oil transactions.

8538 2018-09-09 19:15:18 Actually the underlying issue is that people lack the science and media literacy to separate medicine from the sham therapies of predatory providers.

8556 2018-09-09 19:12:31 I have to disagree. That shit will make oil in your coke. And those floaties!  Ruin a perfectly good coke. (And I'm a pepper)
8557 2018-09-09 19:12:31 Trump is a snake oil salesmen. You don't have to be convicted of a crime to earn disrespect. Trump lost all respect when he accused Obama of not being an American. He could earn it back, but he hasn't so much as tried yet.
8558 2018-09-09 19:12:27 I am nice & I live a life consistent in which my words=my actions. I responsibly use & don't disparage oil technology that I use everyday to make my modern life better.

8561 2018-09-09 19:11:59 GST for Petrol , Diesel & Alcohol is a good idea. Cannabis should be legalized too. However, A Bharat Bandh takes India down in economy which results into rupee devaluation & increase in import price for the Oil in International Price, We also exports Fuel & Beef to 15 Countries.
8562 2018-09-09 19:11:53 @Kusakabe_Co I'm still having fun exploring the merits of Aqyla, but I would love it  if you made your oil colors available on your international online  store!

8579 2018-09-09 19:09:42 If the cost of one commodity is decreasing doesn't justify the increase in the cost of the other. 
One thing is sure, the prices of crude oil were much higher before 2014 than they are now. The price increase then is justified to some extent. But an increase no isn't.

8582 2018-09-09 19:09:10 And now students have started adding a marijuana oil they have concocted with high THC concentrations they are adding to their vape/juul oils. Teachers, Administrators, Parents, all have to be aware and on the look out in order to help!

8604 2018-09-09 19:06:10 As to why people object to PK and palm oil, their concerns are environmental and focus on deforestation, sustainably and loss of habitat for wildlife
8605 2018-09-09 19:06:06 You’re old enough to separate simplicity and full review. Petrol hikes are calculated by oil prices and some Incase through oil exchanges with Saudi Arabia and UAE enters USD/ZAR influences. So what you just said is really not nice and you old for that kinda “ Bashing style “ :)

8692 2018-09-09 18:54:39 Hard to reason with any Con, but especially one that pisses oil.
8693 2018-09-09 18:54:01 Did you know that U are using products produced with oil while protesting the same product? How do you sleep at night with those contradictions? Are your rules for only the "little people"? Do U think that you are superior to others and you are unaccountable 2 the same standards?

8695 2018-09-09 18:53:34 Here is a thought.  China is using its gold to pay the Russians/ME for its 9 million bod of oil imports.  They want gold not dollars.
8696 2018-09-09 18:53:33 coconut oil got me shinning
8697 2018-09-09 18:53:21 You know you’re an adult when you use your birthday money on gas and an oil change for your car. Then you get paid the next day, BUT IT GOES INTO SAVINGS. 
8698 2018-09-09 18:53:20 Ethereum is not dead. If anything it Will Come back stronger. Bitcoin is gold, ethereum is oil of cryptocurrencies
8699 2018-09-09 18:52:56 Esto de subir impuestos por ejemplo el precio del gas oil está muy bien también. Cómo te va a votar la gente pedrito???

8701 2018-09-09 18:52:39 GTFO of Syria. Leave it alone. Let the Syrian people be. Quit bombing them, quit meddling in other countries, quit using chemical weapons on them a la Agent Orange, quit trying to steal their oil. Just get out. @realDonaldTrump #GTFOofSyria #Syria #Idlib #FalseFlag
8702 2018-09-09 18:52:23 You omitted the single most important issue:
What did he commit to regarding Supreme Court challenges to environmental regulations from Big Oil & other fossil fuel interests?

Climate change is the all-encompassing issue.  And all indications are he's in industry's court.
8703 2018-09-09 18:52:14 naiwan pa talaga yung efficascent oil sa sasakyan
8704 2018-09-09 18:52:01 Ikr my nana is 73, grew up doing homework by an oil lamp and now she follows me on instagram for art updates and sends me dog filter photos of herself on messenger
8705 2018-09-09 18:51:57 What was the rate of crude oil in UPA tenure and what is during NDA. It was 80 to 140 USD and during NDA its never crossed 80. Infact it reached to its lowest level of below 34 USD.  Its not correct on govt part to earn petrol money for Bullet train like political project
8706 2018-09-09 18:51:54 Oil put me under the bed no kap

8710 2018-09-09 18:51:42 Compromise:

Alcoholic Östsvensker gets the Whiskey, Norwegian resource extractors get the oil and gas.
8711 2018-09-09 18:51:41 Govt should abolish “Fair Trade Pricing” of domestically produced crude oil. This policy is clearly created for benefiting Oil companies #BharathBandh
8712 2018-09-09 18:51:38 blimey Tony, that is a big one you have.
8713 2018-09-09 18:51:37 Yeah inline, not so easy to get to on mine though got to take the front whet and bumper of, and yeah just the pads, if I get time I'll change the oil and oil filter too.
8714 2018-09-09 18:51:27 A shipper today may decide to exit the oil sands, as Shell did. The new owners may not run their operations well and end up going bankrupt. 
Things happen there are no 100% guarantees. The only certainty is the presence of risk.
8715 2018-09-09 18:51:24 Burning the midnight oil doing Sunday costs budgets (it always feels like midnight when budgets are involved) #costs #msbsolicitors #litigation 
8716 2018-09-09 18:51:15 And one more thing.. In future if oil prices suddenly rises(bcoz OECD countries planning increase their prices n reduce supplies also) India oil price will not change much. It is advantage.

Fluctuations may happen any time in this globalised era. Somany countries r in crisis now
8717 2018-09-09 18:50:47 Oh my name? Yeah when you see thick black smoke coming from more than 700 burning Oil Wells and you’re surrounded by IED... its like a Metal Haze
8718 2018-09-09 18:50:41 Trying my hand at my own thing with seared pork loin,  green beans, rice noodles, soy sauce, seasame oil and a lil brown sugar

8720 2018-09-09 18:50:28 yes i hardly wear makeup and i’ve been using rose oil with aloe vera
8721 2018-09-09 18:50:13 Oil states don't believe in the climate crisis.
8722 2018-09-09 18:50:10 I also struggle with this issue, my mom got me some CBD oil that I spray in my mouth and it makes my stomach aches go away within 10mins or less, I also carry tums with me everywhere
8723 2018-09-09 18:50:05 Idk how but I smell like sesame oil today and I’m really happy about it
8724 2018-09-09 18:50:01 Kindly do consider about 50% down in oil price will chance entire picture! 
My humble request to you Mahamahim!

8726 2018-09-09 18:49:59 The macabre irony to all of this is the very thing he protests about is the thing that propelled him to notoriety. Absent this one event he would live out his life in mediocrity and anonymity.
8727 2018-09-09 18:49:59 omg ok this is excellent... i was referring to the SR oil but might try the kiehls actually (v oily skin tho but hoping the double cleanse w ceramic slip will help GET into these pores)

8730 2018-09-09 18:49:31 They aren't going to 'Do' anything with it I don't think. Just transition away from the existing bankrupt petro$ system. Allowing oil sellers to settle in Gold is like the Eddie Murphy lalalala I can't hear u Jeffrey moment (towards noisy  rhetoric).

8735 2018-09-09 18:48:56 If there were a such thing as momentum in this game, if it existed prior to the delay, no way it does now. It basically becomes a new football game, 7-3 notwithstanding. Best possible scenario for #Titans, as the defense was leaking oil badly and the offense had sputtered.
8736 2018-09-09 18:48:55 I’m not sure what the problem is with @dazn_ca. Are they running a single server out of someone’s basement on a dial-up modem? Ridiculous

8740 2018-09-09 18:48:13 No you walked over yourselves giving the province away with 43 years of conservatives bending you over You think that can be fixed in 4 years? & you think that whats good for big oil is good for you? lol Whats good for big oil is good for big oil They dont give 1 fuck about you
8741 2018-09-09 18:48:12 Not ‘all’ alike, but a lot follow pretty similar designs, especially the smaller stadiums. There are very few that really stand out, the Wembley arch is as exciting as it gets. Personally, I love Bank of America stadium, US Bank and Lucas Oil stadiums look great too

8748 2018-09-09 18:47:29 They deserve all the love they can get, and sometimes to strengthen a relationship you need to shut it down. An engine can run without oil, but it will fail soon and it will be spectacular
8749 2018-09-09 18:47:19 Yeah zero  but we are now a big club. We used to be a mid table club. I don’t see another club in Prem who’ve made the progression we have in last decade without oil money.
8750 2018-09-09 18:47:16 What kind of hike do you want listen? Check excise duty of 2014 and 2018 and see hike. Check crude oil price before 2014 and after 2014 and see hike. It is not your problem. You are just speaking what had you listen. Brother open your eyes and be logical. Don’t behave like robot

8755 2018-09-09 18:46:13 The metals/ores are flattening - iron or down - copper , oil - early to tell, still not looking good. Soybeans - stockpiled (the price is a bargain +it is a food=inelastic). Gold imports vs. exports - well that will be interesting if stats are to be trusted.

8757 2018-09-09 18:45:41 I like to rock a more solid coconut oil as far an function is concerned. The diaspora emotional marker of when it happens, that different feels. lol

8773 2018-09-09 18:44:06 My mom bought me CBD oil and said “Shanae I think this will help you”. 
Damn is it that noticeable that I’m losing my shit?
8774 2018-09-09 18:43:54 I’d be for the pipeline if instead of shipping it overseas we used the oil to make Canada energy independent first. After we have cheap and accessible fuels, we then ship the remaining products. It would also remove our need to import any oil.
8775 2018-09-09 18:43:51 Don't be stressed homie, smoke some CBD oil lol
8776 2018-09-09 18:43:50 One cannot call themselves a “progressive” while taking big &$ from big oil, big Wall St., etc. thats what angers Progressives.  We need to bring these 2 sides together... honestly, authentically... for WE THE PEOPLE. 3/FIN

Used car from a buy here pay here
8778 2018-09-09 18:43:34 Everyone of us must somehow get involved in protecting the environment before Trump  and his cult are able to strip it bare and allow it to erode under the pressure from the Koch Brothers, Oil Companies and just the plain greed exhibited by many in Trump orbit.
8779 2018-09-09 18:43:00 Also the issue that for the foreseeable future, since hydrogen gives the biggest profit margin when it's cracked from crude oil it the fuel will continue to be greenwash until we either run out of crude or make it more expensive for companies to make fossil hydrogen Vs renewable.

8808 2018-09-09 18:39:53 Oil pulling is an alternative medical practice in which oil is "swished" around the mouth. The claims made for the benefits of oil pulling are implausible, and there is no good evidence that it is of any health benefits.

8820 2018-09-09 18:39:03 The Neoliberal offensive (in the military sense) started mid-70s, in the 1st oil crisis.

But the fierce last assault began in the 80s, under Reagan and Thatcher.

Since then, Neoliberalism has rotten everything it has touched. Everywhere.
8821 2018-09-09 18:38:56 The first election was forgivable. He opponent was McCain and O was quite the s snake oil salesman.
8822 2018-09-09 18:38:35 Which countries are backing ISIS? Which countries are killing Yemenis children? It’s their habit to get revenge of poor children, because of so-called parents wrong doing!!!

8826 2018-09-09 18:38:27 Not mentioning the rate  of crude oil that time and now. Not mentioning the tax % on fule that time and now. Very easy to compare but actual khel is rate of crude oil per barrel was 110 to 140 USD now its between 50 to 70 .
8827 2018-09-09 18:38:06 He needs to discuss those oil rights that Putin wants.  More important than remembering 9-11.
8828 2018-09-09 18:37:45 “Black gold...oil that is...”
8829 2018-09-09 18:37:40 He's allergic to cheese.... Don't you get it?? And he takes olive oil. So he didn't talk of banning edible oil and oil seed imports worth almost $ 7 B... Cheese imports are around $ 5 M approx if not less....
8830 2018-09-09 18:37:38 And you point is? We have too pay for millionaires and billionaires tax cut, how can we subsidize oil company’s and feed poor kids. CRAZY
8831 2018-09-09 18:36:55 If Trump's bluster about NAFTA turns out to be true, watch food prices and gasoline, diesel, heating oil, natural gas, and electricity costs skyrocket in the states.  Magats have absolutely no idea how much your economy is linked to imports from Canada.
8832 2018-09-09 18:36:54 Better than giving it to big oil so they can declare another dividend ya troll
8833 2018-09-09 18:36:52 I'm looking to commission an oil painting: Its me, muscles glistening, dressed as Marty Jannetty circa Wrestlemania 7, rescuing chocolate Labrador puppies from a building that's been blown up by the cop from Streets Of Rage. Plz Retweet.
8834 2018-09-09 18:36:42 @TheRoyGreenShow lets get a dedicated oil rail line built on railway right of way. Faster, easier and more versatile long term than a pipeline.

8839 2018-09-09 18:35:53 2 weeks ago I said to put mah.v back on your radar, they are redoing their horizontal leg on their "first in area well" Oil and gas shows throughout, already been fracked, so should be quick in & out! make a few $$
8840 2018-09-09 18:35:52 Ideas... What would you use in place of Thyme oil? I can't find my Thyme anywhere, and I really need it..
8841 2018-09-09 18:35:50 oh brady is a literal snake oil salesman with that tb12 method nonsense. but being a huge piece of shit isn't quite the same as being a herb

8843 2018-09-09 18:35:47 She looks decidedly hillbillyish to me. And I believe she lives in a trailer next door to an oil well.
8844 2018-09-09 18:35:45 Say No to #BharatBandh ! If they(@INCIndia) want to reduce oil prices why don't they first reduce the taxes in the states ruled by them i.e.  #Karnataka #Bengal #Kerala #Andhra #Punjab and their Friends. Why do they want to make our life difficult. #NoMoreBharatBandh

8848 2018-09-09 18:35:05 Stop digging you already struck oil.
8849 2018-09-09 18:34:54 If ur question is why extra virgin oil has different prices, then u should ask yourself why wine has different price from one bottle to another.
8850 2018-09-09 18:34:52 Why don't people know this? Astounding. It's why we're in this mess--RU & Germany after the war. Nazi's & mob. Oil.
8851 2018-09-09 18:34:41 You can also use some drops of olive oil in it.
8852 2018-09-09 18:34:40 How about the whole world act decisively, reduce their dependence on oil to the absolute lowest levels possible, and put many of the world's bad actors out of business.
8853 2018-09-09 18:34:39 Tea Tree Oil soap from SoapWorks smells absolutely amazing. That is all.
8854 2018-09-09 18:34:36 Aweee. Thanks. But i do my own oil change

8858 2018-09-09 18:34:22 If your willing to spend a bit of money, I swear by Sunday Riley’s U.F.O oil, it’s like 35 euro for a 15ml bottle but it was fab for me, or The Ordinary do one for 10 quid online I think. Not too sure about cleansers though I use a Lush one x
8859 2018-09-09 18:34:22 Why not call it borage oil rather than starflower #countryfile
8860 2018-09-09 18:34:11 In other news there's a Scrapbook Expo here November 2/3. I had to skip last year's cos I was too scared, but I think with the CBD oil my pain and anxiety issues should be manageable. Haven't scrapbooked in a bit, but I usually do enjoy our outings there.
8861 2018-09-09 18:34:08 With Jim Irsay, Bill Tobin, Bill Polian, and Chris Ballard at Lucas Oil Stadium today, we are short Ryan Grigson from having every GM in Indianapolis #Colts history at the game today!
8862 2018-09-09 18:34:08 I usually just take a hot shower, exfoliate, and massage a body oil on me. It is bc our skin is stretching. I personally use rosehip oil bc it's good for your skin but it also smells good, gives a natural glow or shea moisture coconut hibiscus oil. A bit of aromatherapy is key
8863 2018-09-09 18:33:58 With strong ties to Exxon and the entire oil industry.  Establishing that back channel Rex was originally hired to do?
8864 2018-09-09 18:33:45 We have to win 2018 elections.

If u help modi
Indians will help u win in US
8865 2018-09-09 18:33:31 I want to know what kind of shampoo and conditioner he’s using. Was this a hair mask or a hot oil treatment? Bc it’s looking so extra fluffy. 
8866 2018-09-09 18:33:27 In Robert Downey Jr. best voice. “I want one”
8867 2018-09-09 18:33:20 I bought a new lavender diffuser oil, a face and a foot mask and I’m gonna drink a bottle of wine and cry once my shift is over
8868 2018-09-09 18:33:04 Modi can easily play real politics. Reduce excise and bring petrol  even to less than 60 Rs. He can also have oil deficit of 200000 crore the way Sardardi did. Why care about oil deficit= Don't we produce more than 90% oil and even export it leaving nothing for Indians. 
8869 2018-09-09 18:33:02 Lol. Sorry, don't worry you'd get it back. Mix it with Olive Oil and Coconut Oil. Heard that mixture works faster.
8870 2018-09-09 18:32:58 Starflower oil is very good for women going through menopause, I sailed through mine with almost no symptoms thanks to it #countryfile
8871 2018-09-09 18:32:56 When your brother know his nephew allergic to peanuts & buys ChicFilA knowing they cook in peanut oil. I can’t wait til you have kids hoe @King_Z_Bailey 
8872 2018-09-09 18:32:45 And the "label" in oil is virgin, or extra Virgin. Don't know what ur question is anymore. Is that u think you're buying normal oil market with extra virgin label? If that so, denounce it. Just like u'd denounce if u find out that 95 octanes gas u r buying really has less than 90
8873 2018-09-09 18:32:23 Btw I'm not against legalising cannabis, never have been, I actually think it should've been done a long time ago, especially the oil that's been proven to help with severe epilepsy.
8874 2018-09-09 18:32:19 Issue oil bonds for at least 10-12% of total purchase value if not whole or more. Decrease oil prices by at least 6-8% 
@narendramodi @HMOIndia @PMOIndia
8875 2018-09-09 18:32:18 You need a mist. Warm water in a spray bottle. Spray enough to moisten the scalp without it dripping. Follow up with whatever oil you use to base.
8876 2018-09-09 18:32:08 Why did the Satanic illuminati make cannabis illegal in 1937? Exactly. Over 20,000 products can be made from hemp alone but that wouldn't support their evil agenda of controlling us thru oil to make us debt slaves or of controlling our bodies thru Big Pharma by hiding the cure.
8877 2018-09-09 18:31:56 Big Oil is highly adaptable. Cronyism is rife.

8880 2018-09-09 18:31:14 Also I kinda prefer a solid coconut oil, I feel like it’s easier to control how much I use?? Maybe that’s just me
8881 2018-09-09 18:31:09 A large portion of I75 smells like someone dumped motor oil into a bin of half-cooked McDonald’s fries. I think I gained a few pounds on the drive home.
8882 2018-09-09 18:30:59 Use CBD oil almost daily.
8883 2018-09-09 18:30:56 Someone set me up a go fund me so I can afford to feed into my growing essential oil addiction
8884 2018-09-09 18:30:53 @JustinTrudeau has never worked  at any job as demanding as the oil patch.  Yet he thinks he’s qualified to pass judgement on gender parity? I CHOOSE to not work in that sector as do many women.

To me, #BharatBandh is yet another self goal by #RahulGandhi - more people now know about 2Lac Crores Oil Bonds. What #BJP spokies couldn't do effectively, #Congress Party did it for BJ

8891 2018-09-09 18:30:07 Its an island....and no big functional port so manufacturing companies may not want to settle there....but there are big n small oil companies there like you said....trust me the power supply helps...

8895 2018-09-09 18:29:22 Finally going to learn what @ENERGY does, @SecretaryPerry, or is this just an oil and gas tour?  
And I know you think @realDonaldTrump will be impressed, but please try not to leak too much classified info. 

Thanks,

8898 2018-09-09 18:28:56 So, my halftime eval from Lucas Oil:

- Luck has been extremely solid, barring the INT. Nice statline, great throw for the TD.
- I've enjoyed watching @TheNyNy7 today. Couple of neat runs makes me think we'll be fine without Turbin and Mack.... #Colts
8899 2018-09-09 18:28:46 I dropped my car off for an oil change and get a call saying it’ll take $2000 with a discount & 3 days to fix it 
8900 2018-09-09 18:28:43 Thought youz were going to say it was ..Oil Of OLLIE  BODY CREAM!!
8901 2018-09-09 18:28:41 This is very telling.  Even though renewables are rising, oil and gas demand are rising faster...
8902 2018-09-09 18:28:40 I need my hair to be long enough so that when I pull it back and work on a car or some shit I can stick my pony tail inside the back of my shirt so I don’t get oil and grease and transmission fluid all up in it 
8903 2018-09-09 18:28:35 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!

8908 2018-09-09 18:27:59 Need more oil to cause oil spill lel
8909 2018-09-09 18:27:54 Nothing I hate like when a food has too much oil
8910 2018-09-09 18:27:46 Looks great on a chart, but most of the resources BIG OIL & GAS are chasing are either hard to tap into or in places where the earth is being decimated. They started tapping into western PA natural gas & now the water is poison and making people sick. 1 deep well blowout = DOOM.
8911 2018-09-09 18:27:12 When there is no more oil in the tin lamps, l light my own eyes.
8912 2018-09-09 18:27:07 Green Oil and Tea!

8914 2018-09-09 18:27:04 Yes i read this article earlier today. These luxury items is just drama baazi like austerity drive. Major things are still fuel and palm oil.

8920 2018-09-09 18:25:44 Lolololololol. Oil spills that effect the environment is not even comparable to twitter.
8921 2018-09-09 18:25:38 It’s not as it seems from the outside oh, steady electricity but you don’t see companies flocking there to go and start up shop, the companies there are mostly oil and gas cause those are the natural resources there, you’d think there’d be manufacturing companies, but no.
8922 2018-09-09 18:25:23 From what I read they sat on their oil riches without developing other forms of income, education, etc. When prices dropped it no longer provided. We don't need to invade, they need to diversify. They are woefully behind, but invading is ignorant. 1850s thinking.
8923 2018-09-09 18:25:07 Iran and Venezuela have oil and gas as well. The stupidity is that Trump regards all things Socialist and Islam to be enemies while it's just totalitarian regimes that's the problem. And he and all right wing populists would like to import that problem in western democracies.
8924 2018-09-09 18:25:04 I’m 10000 over on my oil change  i drive a Nissan. It’s okay 
8925 2018-09-09 18:24:50 How many oil spills since shell?
8926 2018-09-09 18:24:24 i was gona go to michaels and buy oil paint stuff but its suddenly super windy and raining and cold so nvm
8927 2018-09-09 18:24:19 They settle trade the way it's always been settled and float themselves that way per existing oil purchases ....or are just in a way better position during an intl rebasing than those countries with no/little Gold (US/UK)

8949 2018-09-09 18:20:15 Remember that 20% of the oil company?
8950 2018-09-09 18:20:09 I’ve produced 45KWh of heat today from 10.6KWh of electricity; 5 from the sun, 5.6 from night rate electricity. If that was oil, it would be >€4; instead it was 50c. Also charged EV @ night - 13KWh €1.14 vs 6.27. Saved €8.68 (84%) today. 20kg co2 (76%).

8953 2018-09-09 18:19:49 I used to think essential oils were hokie—at least half of 'em like snake oil—but once I discovered they gave me the ability to perform matter transmutation, all doubt was gone from my mind. 
8954 2018-09-09 18:19:38 Extra virgin olive oil.
8955 2018-09-09 18:19:33 #countryfile remember in the 60s when they said North Sea oil would be the saviour cheap fuel for everyone we know what happened to that
8956 2018-09-09 18:19:33 is this related to increasing Oil and LPG price?
8957 2018-09-09 18:19:27 Ek baar ke lie maan lia oil rs.10 sasta bhi ho gaya to kya bachega pure mahine me 500 ya 1000, are daale, chini , aata, sabji ye sasti hai bachao bhi aur khao bhi.

8959 2018-09-09 18:19:05 speaking with Richard Masson, Univ of Calgary School of Public Policy re TMX. Ahead this hour replay of Frank McKenna, deputy chairman TD Bank on $117 billion lost to Cdn economy over 7yrs by selling our oil to U.S. at deep discount.

8963 2018-09-09 18:18:38 without the rest of the world 
america wouldn't be able to rob everyones oil and riches
8964 2018-09-09 18:18:31 it’s not bennificial or efficient to build more refineries, even with the TMX Alberta oil cannot be extracted fast enough or cost effectively to both upgrade and refine, ext+upg+Rfn = to much per bbl. right now Oil is around $30 a bbl to turn into a bbl of oil.
8965 2018-09-09 18:18:25 Frankly I could spend the time recommended for oil pulling doing something a little more productive.
8966 2018-09-09 18:18:04 Water / Tea, some far food (something fried on oil) that helps me.  And most important - sleep.  Keep hydrated darling 
8967 2018-09-09 18:17:47 History time!
In 1976 Canadians subsidized the Line 9 pipeline to send crude from Alberta to a half-dozen oil refineries in Montreal. It lost money.  Lots of it. Two decades later, Enbridge reversed the flow as a glut in overseas markets led to lower prices. 
Now you know.
8968 2018-09-09 18:17:38 Which CBD oil do you use?

8970 2018-09-09 18:17:31 None of these dipshits have worked in construction or the oil patch. They do not have any comprehension of how physically demanding a majority of the jobs are. It is not discriminatory to say men and women are physically different.

8974 2018-09-09 18:17:14 Dear slave of BJP, where do you get sugar at 32 rs/kg?
And if you were buying onion and tomato at 100 rs/kg, then you are a fool.
You should also be including crude oil and petrol and Diesel prices.
8975 2018-09-09 18:17:14 Crude oil barel $40 இருந்தபோதும் பாஜக ஆட்சியில் விலை குறைக்கப்படவில்லை. வசூல் செய்த வரிப்பணம் நீரவ் மோடி மற்றும் கார்பரேட்டுகளுக்கு கடனாகக் கொடுத்து ஏமாறப்பட்டது. மக்களுக்கு பட்டை நாமம்.
8976 2018-09-09 18:17:12 Thank you ladies for a lovely weekend teaching how to make personalised mannequins they all look great! We have a couple of places left on our oil cloth bag workshop next Saturday and our Roman blind workshop on the 23rd September, hope you can make it!
8977 2018-09-09 18:17:10 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
8978 2018-09-09 18:16:59 I've heard it before. The God who speaks and dead come to life, won't need it. But it wouldn't surprise me if cannabis was included in the Holy anointing oil of the ark of the covenant, and the temple.

8981 2018-09-09 18:16:51 The interest rates are unrealistically high, often countries repay debt in natural resources such as cobalt or oil.
8982 2018-09-09 18:16:49 You don't wanna pack a chainsaw.  Fuel  oil fricking everywhere
8983 2018-09-09 18:16:34 Time to buy a new face oil (｡•́︿•̀｡)
8984 2018-09-09 18:16:23 आपने oil bond पर जो लूट मचाई थी उसका क्या, कम से कम जाते जाते तो दे जाते
8985 2018-09-09 18:16:20 See first I m not pro BJP..
And second thing is the ans is multi dimensional
of course its a bold step to keep oil prices high.

Ppl who purchases petrol never bothers in absolute terms. nly common people(Majority Indians who use petrol like water not common ppl) really bothers
8986 2018-09-09 18:16:01 and you're not? my coconut oil is solid now. admittedly, it's a hard transition for me.
8987 2018-09-09 18:15:52 yes! just leave them entirely alone for a month and rub coconut oil on them. once they’ve grown out you’ll want to get them threaded for shaping :)
8988 2018-09-09 18:15:35 kurang suka with this cleansing oil.
8989 2018-09-09 18:15:24 WHY IS THE COST OF PETROL AND DIESEL "RISING DAY BY DAY" WHILE THE COST OF CRUDE OIL AND PETROLEUM IS "DECREASING" IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET. PLZ TELL US OUR RESPECTED PM MODI JI
8990 2018-09-09 18:15:22 I don't really use the stuff people buy me beard oil, Cologne, perfumes.
8991 2018-09-09 18:15:17 Rather disingenuous of May to suggest such a thing , she is essentially implying nationalization of oil . If one is in that deep , pipelines would be the next logical step . We all know she does not believe  the words she says
8992 2018-09-09 18:15:08 Now we are cooking with Peanut Oil Tampa!
8993 2018-09-09 18:15:08 GOOD FATS: Avocado, Fish, Almonds, Walnuts, Peanuts, Cashews, Olive Oil, Coconut Oil, Seeds, Coconut, Olives, Peanut Butter, Low-Fat Dairy
8994 2018-09-09 18:14:58 Good advice. I'll start by saying the sob should be paying taxes on his snake oil proceeds.
8995 2018-09-09 18:14:40 The Government which YOU back, gives our oil away in case it makes Scotland look good and idiots like you can't see it, they'd rather run it at a loss for however many years it takes as long as independence is eventually off the table Which, sadly for them, will never happen.
8996 2018-09-09 18:14:29 Looks like the illuminati desperately wants there oil banks in Syria to control middle East oil money support Putin in stopping them .
8997 2018-09-09 18:14:28 I used to use a strengthening nail oil, it's good for improving the condition of your nails. It was a Sally Hanson product that you can get in Boots or Super drug and probably the supermarket
8998 2018-09-09 18:14:24 As usual pass interference calls at Lucas Oil not going Colts way
8999 2018-09-09 18:14:23 Excuse me. It’s well known that Crisis PR Experts coach major corporate clients who are behind catastrophic oil spills or have caused a fire to rage through British public life claiming everyone in its path.
9000 2018-09-09 18:14:19 My mum does this, once my cousin had to ask her “and what if I poison your food” she said “go on then, that’s your problem” my mum will scold my life and ask me to oil her scalp. I’m tired
9001 2018-09-09 18:13:55 Exactly oil, mining corps leaving Canada because of Heavy legislation and failure to complete projects! Thriving! ...Stagnating,Crippling, Destroying are all more descriptive and realistic terms for the Lieberal and NDP green practises have done to western Canada!
9002 2018-09-09 18:13:48 Let me understand if America goes to Venezuela to "help", oh the "Good Samaritan right"? no! The proven oil reserves in Venezuela are recognized as the largest in the world, totaling 297 billion barrels (4.72×1010 m3) as of 1 January 2014.
9003 2018-09-09 18:13:35 I think we are all reminded that Obama  sells snake oil. Worst president in history.
9004 2018-09-09 18:13:34 Wow that is a hell of a resume wish I could hook you up with 3 friends who have been in the oil industry for more than 30 years hit me on the message with a link to your resume and I'll at least pass it on...

9006 2018-09-09 18:13:29 I have been an outspoken Boiler fan for years, took a decade off when 'life/work/kids' required. I ALWAYS stand-up for MY teams. I will confront idiot fans on both sides (usually my own). Have done this at Ross-Ade, Lucas Oil and other venues. 
Fan First!
9007 2018-09-09 18:13:22 Paying Oil bond? to which country ? Any proof...No debt is on public..Liers...Govt has looted 11 lac crores in 4 years as fuel tax
9008 2018-09-09 18:13:12 Lots of family offices would like to see someone take first leap and then I hope/expect others to follow and then who knows what price is! It is not a binary oil drill. At 10p still only 10mln mkt cap lots of other total pieces of shit valued much higher
9009 2018-09-09 18:12:52 I think we can think of a bunch of other things not mentioned in the original Constitution: 
1: blue jeans
2: iPhones
3: swimming pools
4: toothbrushes 
5: oil changes
6: space force
Should I keep going? Are we going to ban all them too?
9010 2018-09-09 18:12:50 can't trust white people Yelp ratings on foreign restaurants. this girl reviewed a Japanese sushi place, called it "unami" oil and said "Zaijian Felicia" which is Chinese. the ignorance jumped out!
9011 2018-09-09 18:12:28 Oak logs prepared with sacred oil for a funeral pyre.
9012 2018-09-09 18:12:21 so is @arvindkejrowal  reducing state taxes and advocating to bring Oil under GST, you should start campaigns with @RahulGandhi & @MamataOfficial to accommodate oil in GST. So that ppl have less burden. We have high hopes from you. Sir Aap dharna denge naa.
9013 2018-09-09 18:12:19 Nope...snake oil I guess 
9014 2018-09-09 18:12:15 Significant items are Oil, Palm oil and tea
9015 2018-09-09 18:12:01 スタンプVnってコメントしましょ(笑)
9016 2018-09-09 18:12:01 Now we don't have any oil and Citgo, they are of the dark government, that's why we don't care about it, the only thing that we want is FREEDOM!
9017 2018-09-09 18:12:00 Anything made from crude oil (plastics, fuels, paints, skincare products, etc.) can be made with hemp seed oil, without crude pollution.
9018 2018-09-09 18:11:52 I just saw a chef put olive oil over a watermelon slice and I feel like this is my supervillain origin story.
9019 2018-09-09 18:11:48 I never mention “oil” in any of my tweets.

You’re making this up now ?
9020 2018-09-09 18:11:20 so my bootlegger is beginning a new service of providing booze in olive oil and honey bottles

9023 2018-09-09 18:11:00 Oil prices are DOWN 4%.
9024 2018-09-09 18:10:46 I see countryfile moaning about fracking, no mention that the U.K. Has been fracking for oil & gas for over 40 years.
9025 2018-09-09 18:10:36 I'm beginning to suspect Russia, Trump, Guliani, Alex Jones, big oil and GOP were somehow contributors to 9-11. It gave birth to so called truthers, conspiracy theories, that have taken over. Try them all for treason.
9026 2018-09-09 18:10:25 well you know summer is over when your coconut oil is solidified
9027 2018-09-09 18:10:20 【中の人より】「子猫」「猫」「ありがとう」「寒い」等で反応します今後も反応する言葉を増やしていく予定です
9028 2018-09-09 18:10:16 6/ The reason oil and gas contribute less in our GDP is "Oil and Gas are seen as sources of REVENUE rather than ENERGY". Every 24/25th Comm of Finance, etc(FAAC) come to share. We produce and export for revenues instead of adding value. Cocoa farmer gets 18% value from chocolate
9029 2018-09-09 18:10:11 She’s actually opposite of Trump, he’s pro pipeline and oil.
9030 2018-09-09 18:10:11 Then why the fuck are you saying they spent all oil revenues.

9033 2018-09-09 18:09:55 Yes!!! Enough people remember the damage from the Santa Barbara oil spill. Never again. The coast is a treasure.
9034 2018-09-09 18:09:53 Here in Canada our leaders suck.... Look at all the oil jobs we are basically giving you.... You can hate our leaders just like us Canadians ...
9035 2018-09-09 18:09:50 It's the Cosmo Kramer giant ball of oil!
9036 2018-09-09 18:09:49 Oh, that must just be Britain... thanks for clearing that up. In that case, today I'll get turkey, 12", italian bread, provolone, avacado, tomatoes, onions, lettuce, salt/pepper, oil/wine vinegar... (I see myself heading out the door now.)
9037 2018-09-09 18:09:39 We should have taken Iran's oil. We could lower the gas prices and help save money for our crunchy roll subscriptions.
9038 2018-09-09 18:09:35 Ginger oil does wonders
9039 2018-09-09 18:09:27 Lies & Trust Issues...Oil & Water.
9040 2018-09-09 18:09:26 @realDonaldTrump It shows the power of the sanctions that the Iranian regime has become weak and will not be in Iran with full oil and banking sanctions of this bloodthirsty regime.
9041 2018-09-09 18:09:19 I got tomatoes drying in the oven with olive oil and fresh garlic.  8 hrs on 200
9042 2018-09-09 18:09:10 @BalticExchange Are you planning a correction on fuel oil burning reference routes of the index after 2020 Sulphur Cap?
9043 2018-09-09 18:08:59 There will be more discount in Asia, because Saudi oil can travel in ULCCs, when Burrard inlet can only handle Aframax ships 1/4 the size.
9044 2018-09-09 18:08:57 Beer, food, money, cost of coffee, sex, why do we still have the penny, how much will a house cost on Mars, oil, drugs(good-Bad), Indians and BBQ.....
9045 2018-09-09 18:08:55 Dont come to me when you need your oil changed.
9046 2018-09-09 18:08:42 @JohnTorode1 catching up with celebrity masterchef and loving the look of your chicken cordon bleu with crispy potatoes, where can I find the recipe? Or could you let me know how much water/oil to use when cooking the potatoes? Thanks! #masterchef
9047 2018-09-09 18:08:38 And if true how does this diminish their argument? If this is a marketplace of product and ideas, political ideology being the product here, then fair and equal access should apply absent regulation.
9048 2018-09-09 18:08:32 Women who are built like Olive Oil from the Popeye cartoons that talk to toxic and destructive beings like they're not capable of breaking them in half are both bold and ignorant.
9049 2018-09-09 18:08:10 Kudos, the Maharishi cult-linked Non-GMO Project is part of a multi-billion-dollar modern-day snake oil industry which defrauds consumers with false & misleading fear profiteering, market manipulations & competitor smearing.
9050 2018-09-09 18:08:00 WD40 is not a lubricant. You should clean with WD40 then lubricate with oil!
9051 2018-09-09 18:07:59 No worries, the steel and oil will wreck someone else's environment, and as they are far away and poor, we needn't worry our pretty little heads...
9052 2018-09-09 18:07:52 I know they have weed oil cartridges for the Juul but in NYC? I’ve only seen that shit in Cali  Whooo the plug
9053 2018-09-09 18:07:49 Many other states are not going for elections.... I think the issue is not about high oil prices... It is to do more with the way collected revenue is being used... There is hardly any information as to where and how will this money be used... Transparency is needed
9054 2018-09-09 18:07:32 @WeledaUK Hi, What's the pH of your Almond Soothing Cleansing Lotion and is it non-comedogenic? Thanks. Love your almond oil by the way!
9055 2018-09-09 18:07:30 I did not see the cartoon so I can't really comment about that specific cartoon. I have seen political cartoons that use what could be called racialist stereotypes. I am oil for free speech especially in this fight. I think though, Twitter , Facebook, and others wood ban.
9056 2018-09-09 18:07:17 We need to stop selling weapons to Saudi Arabia. It’s been more than obvious that this is what they are used for. Oil and greed. The US needs to stop being apart of this atrocity.
9057 2018-09-09 18:07:05 Don't want to get verbally bitch slapped? Don't poke the debate integrity bear. Debate without honor is snake oil, not buying.

9059 2018-09-09 18:06:48 @dandakich Keep hearing high pitched primal scream in Lucas Oil Stadium. Is Serena Williams giving child birth again?
9060 2018-09-09 18:06:39 NAFTA requires 75% of oil & gas produced in Canada must be sold to the US. What's the point of pipelines to the coasts & trying to find new markets? And US is complaining they are being taken advantage of! Seems like it's the other way around.
9061 2018-09-09 18:06:32 Yes, BJP has looted people from petrol scam in last 4years, though crude oil price in international market got down by nearly 50% from previous decade, government never reduced the price, where did all this looted money went, can they give the accounts of this to people of India
9062 2018-09-09 18:06:13 Yes and the oil the law firms the banks the data companies the voting machines and much more! This is a complicated caper!

9067 2018-09-09 18:05:44 Second quarter overreaction: 

Really kind of Andrew Luck to invite the #Bengals to his clinic today at Lucas Oil.

9070 2018-09-09 18:05:26 Petrol prices with International factors
2013: Rs. 83/ltr (With 2 lakh crore debt as oil bonds)
2018: Rs. 80/ltr(No oil bonds)
If you want fake prices now it will affect the country later. As congress with fake pricing brought India GDP growth to 4% in 2013.

9072 2018-09-09 18:05:21 Yep. Just brush them with a olive or coconut oil/ butter mix to seal them and bake till crisp
9073 2018-09-09 18:05:14 Texas without oil would be a larger version of Mississippi.  Every other state would like to be like CA.   If you don't believe that, ask why do they all try to create a Silicon Valley.

9078 2018-09-09 18:04:42 This what happens when social programs are paid for by a single commodity, oil. Socialism requires a diversity of revenue sources to prevent capitalist influences from deliberately wrecking the economy, just so they can say socialism doesn't work.

9081 2018-09-09 18:04:27 Frustrated at not getting the post for looting, few India politicians want #BharathBandh Why non of these politician Question that "inspite of having thorium sufficient for all India energy need of next 300years, yet the country is kept dependent on oil from terror sympathizers
9082 2018-09-09 18:04:10 Bundh called on10th Sept fm Cong in protest4rising price in fuels. How much they have concern4 nation&public. It is responsible4rising price as UPA took2lacs Cr loan on oil bond that causes hike in prices now.NDA repaid loan w/interest of Rs70k Cr too. What more govt should do?/1
9083 2018-09-09 18:04:02 There's a country just s little bit South of you with tons of oil, you could stop sanctioning and starving them; buy that oil and use it during the transition
9084 2018-09-09 18:04:01 No one claimed they were "in power". They're a news organization reporting on what happened. Please justify why farmworkers in SJV should have to live in close proximity to oil and gas extraction which was what they were reporting on after having interviewed someone who was there
9085 2018-09-09 18:03:56 Andy is looking mighty fine on that field in Lucas Oil 
9086 2018-09-09 18:03:49 I used to drink a shot of olive oil every morning,don't worry it's good for you
9087 2018-09-09 18:03:48 You Vike That makes him a bigger herb than the pyramid scheme guy, the snake oil salesman guy, and the virgin because god told me to be guy
9088 2018-09-09 18:03:48 International lo crude oil price thagginappudey ikkada kuda thaggali kani vat penchadam valla
9089 2018-09-09 18:03:39 Repaying Oil Bonds was one of the few good things that #ModiSarkar has done. No second thoughts on that. 

But, my point is, along the way, Govt should have created Price Stabilization Fund - saving for the rainy day is a so well entrenched thinking process for we Indians, no?
9090 2018-09-09 18:03:30 What misfortunes? United is a great club and will continue to be so long after pep is gone. Just don’t be ignorant and deny that that your oil money didn’t inflate the market. You did pay 40mil for mangala and tried to by the whole 2016 Monaco side
9091 2018-09-09 18:03:28 Money other then oil and cattle?! Oh no
9092 2018-09-09 18:03:24 ... "To get your oil changed every 5000 miles"...
9093 2018-09-09 18:03:23 Fun fact: you think 220,000 bbl’s is enough oil to supply the east.
9094 2018-09-09 18:03:18 Cooking with Juhi 101, when in doubt add more olive oil. #cooking #foodie #yum #nomnomnom #sunday #weekend
9095 2018-09-09 18:03:13 I don’t know. Queens has the “Oil Thigh “ too.   smaller UNI (& affordable housing close to campus too) may have something to do with the overwhelming spirit too
9096 2018-09-09 18:02:48 5/ When Oil sneezes , the economy catches extreme COLD.
9097 2018-09-09 18:02:41 That's why a good doctor checks the liver, tries to establish whether key vitamins are being absorbed; a psychiatrist who knows about these differences will try Deplin or even liver & fish oil before prescribing hard drugs to such a patient, because it's an issue of malnutrition.
9098 2018-09-09 18:02:30 Got hit with the oil on my face and hands today, I appreciate and love everybody that’s praying and sending good vibes my way.
9099 2018-09-09 18:02:21 .Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!
9100 2018-09-09 18:02:10 Peace, security and freedom are not finite commodities like land, oil or Gold, which one state can acquire at another's expense.
9101 2018-09-09 18:02:08 me: yeah, i'm gonna!! put some nice oil into my hair and make it!!! shine!!! self care!!!
me, 0.5sec later: so anyways why should i care about skincare routine or taking care of my hair i look and feel horrible anyway so why bother
9102 2018-09-09 18:02:02 Almost 65 years are ruled by @INCIndia in our country why didn't they get some self dependent solutions for all oil contents rather than depending on other countries for import?
#NoBharathBandh
9103 2018-09-09 18:02:01 4/ In conclusion , Agriculture contributes far more than Oil to our GDP however in Revenues Oil dwarfs it , contribution over 70%. The reason we have corruption or resource curse/Dutch disease, because if people pay taxes like in UK every penny will be accounted for Pub Officers
9104 2018-09-09 18:01:53 Good Morning Family.  I just wanted to tell you about the many Job opportunities out here in West Texas.  A lot of them or CDL DRIVER JOBS,  that pay really good, but there are many other jobs in the oilfield in the oil and Gas industry.  678-817-8073
9105 2018-09-09 18:01:53 The Left is trying to Undermine? We don't have to, "that well oil engine, the Trump Train," is grinding it's own wheels, spark to spark, standstill grove. Basically going nowhere.
9106 2018-09-09 18:01:47 They should fried in the hell oil
9107 2018-09-09 18:01:45 Try a castor oil pack! Take an old T-shirt and drench it in castor oil, wrap it around your feet and put like trash bags around it. It should help with circulation to bring down the swelling
9108 2018-09-09 18:01:43 Slow cooker pork dinner and a coconut oil bath to end my Sunday 
9109 2018-09-09 18:01:42 I believe in you $OIL.
9110 2018-09-09 18:01:31 sky’s dad had a girl in his room and he says “oh yaaaa my favorite essential oil is...” and me & sky busted out laughing bc men truly will try their hardest to impress a girl
9111 2018-09-09 18:01:23 Is there actual rumours of Faulk to Edmonton?  It seems like speculation just from a Oiler need and him available.  I hope it happens, as they need a d man that can run a pp, if that’s all he excels at who cares,oil don’t have that guy and there pp showed it last yr#changeitup
9112 2018-09-09 18:01:14 I’m so sorry to hear this. I have a couple of herniated discs in my neck as well. Have you tried a topical CBD cream/oil/massage? I add CBD drops to a bath and it is so relaxing. I was able to come off of two prescription muscle relaxers thanks to CBD.
9113 2018-09-09 18:01:12 Oh, it was a used oil derrick!
9114 2018-09-09 18:01:11 I went on YouTube and looked at organic ways to smell good and they made a whole video of mixing baking soda with coconut oil,  I've never been so bored
9115 2018-09-09 18:01:10 Olive &amp; almond oil are rich in essential fatty acids which help strengthen dry &amp; cracked nails
9116 2018-09-09 18:01:09 I don’t tweeze currently! So just put coconut oil on them??
9117 2018-09-09 18:01:00 In my opinion, it's no coincidence that cultures where olive oil is the primary source of fat suffer from significantly less #cardiovascular disease than others, and it was this #revelation that led to my creating my PAMM ( Pan Asian Modified Mediterranean) #diet! #Vervana
9118 2018-09-09 18:00:58 There is definitely a strong case of the use of CBD oil in the treatment of chronic anxiety.
9119 2018-09-09 18:00:58 What you mean her love of Scottish oil
9120 2018-09-09 18:00:55 So you don't add the oil yet? Do you still rest it for an hour (oil-free)?
9121 2018-09-09 18:00:43 I think if the entire fan base stopped calling him corndog ans used a better nickname (i like oil baron), he would play at least 60% better
9122 2018-09-09 18:00:37 Don't expect legit jewelry from a snake oil vendor.
9123 2018-09-09 18:00:28 Does castor oil really cure illnesses or do people just assume it works because it tastes nasty? Psychosomatic?

9129 2018-09-09 17:59:54 I was hoping this was gonna be one of those “pissed drunk religious whack job who’d be a homeless derelict had he not inherited his Dad’s snake oil business, shoots self in ass at hate rally” videos.
9130 2018-09-09 17:59:47 If y’all only taste this oil down my mother make here eh omg 
9131 2018-09-09 17:59:46 me: dad can you take my car for an oil change
9132 2018-09-09 17:59:44 In Communism China,land,oil, mineral,all the natural resources owned by CCP,so how a American individual company can complete with those CCP owned or controlled companies? Especially the meantime none of the employee in those companies has right to create a union. How? @pjmooney
9133 2018-09-09 17:59:44 Want truly sustainable #palmoil in your snacks? Tell “sustainable” palm oil certifier to DROP palm oil company @Indofood > @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s business partner abuses workers & destroys #orangutan habitat
9134 2018-09-09 17:59:25 Currently sleeping.  Salmon in olive oil tonight.
9135 2018-09-09 17:59:23 honestly I alternate between Suave almond & shea butter (non-shampoo days) and Dove nourishing oil care (post-shampoo)
9136 2018-09-09 17:59:19 Oh you doubting Thomas! Selling snake oil as acute intellectual analysis. There's a place for that! The plantation that raised diamond and silk, Larry and the Sheriff. Go to them for they await idiocy.
9137 2018-09-09 17:59:14 3/ commodity on earth approaching 100 Million BOPD. Try and tax other sectors Agriculture, Mining like Oil they will go extinct in fact they have a lot of exemptions especially Agriculture , go through the Corporate Income Tax Act (CITA) you will see even VAT exemptions
9138 2018-09-09 17:59:02 Eating clean is a good start, no processed food with tons of chemicals. Use herbal treatments, they work. Castor oil best ever for a staph wound.
9139 2018-09-09 17:58:45 Indeed. That's why an infinitely extensible top level domain space & domain user Association (both open & closed)agreement is the way to go. I envisage Dot Oil domain space as oil market universe & oil exchanges as solar systems (light=transparency; gravity=liquidity etc etc).
9140 2018-09-09 17:58:43 For instance, buy a TV. Change the oil in your car, change the tires. Look at all the fees on the invoice. They have to be reported, remitted, and reconciled. Then an army of bureaucrats to process the claims.
9141 2018-09-09 17:58:38 I tried cbd a couple times gummies and oil, it’s chill doesn’t make you feel like a head high.
9142 2018-09-09 17:58:22 If UPA took 2 lac cr oil bond loan madam at that time did you pay any excess for the fuel and did u protest against UPA to sell at actual price. You too njoyed the benefits of it right. Now how can you blame them.
9143 2018-09-09 17:58:18 Sir rest of things are correct plz pay attention towards oil and petroleum and farmers of india
9144 2018-09-09 17:58:11 Goodwin needs CBD cannabis oil and Ice Immediately on that Knee he hammered on a big lineman .....
9145 2018-09-09 17:58:04 It's his Facebook account that have a blue tick also.yes you are right it happened against UPA government's oil price hike.All I wanted to prove is his selective critisicm

9148 2018-09-09 17:57:33 Yes I agree. By all means the government should include petroleum products under the ambit of GST. There are 21 states already on board on this. In the meantime it should also try and wean us away from this need to guzzle imported oil..
9149 2018-09-09 17:57:31 I need all the miracle weed cbd oil and mediation all jokes aside they are getting worse and worse to where I’m just will to do anything for the pain to stop

She said she already had some songs picked out for certain stadiums 3. This is the first time she’s played Lucas oil and what’s the colts mascot? A WHITE HORSE!

9154 2018-09-09 17:57:07 Bet you're from kano.. 
You know u cant handle KD ppl.
9155 2018-09-09 17:57:00 he just had some honey and olive oil
9156 2018-09-09 17:56:56 Lmao ignoring the truth of my statements but still a fail with your defences because  oils still obsolete hemp was made illegal because it can replace oil in every way
9157 2018-09-09 17:56:54 2/ NDDC levy, Education tax, weight and measures, Terminal dues, NIMASA, Navy, Customs . Petroleum Economics 101 will tell you "the cut of a barrel"who gets what and what in a barrel of Oil. The State is still a dominant taker except in PSCs.  Oil is the most traded and liquid
9158 2018-09-09 17:56:48 No, with LDs I think frying pan rim, somewhere between the fire and the hot oil.
9159 2018-09-09 17:56:42 They won't. It just mainstreams oil. For this to happen, we need full BJP + allies
9160 2018-09-09 17:56:39 @Valvoline really let me pay for some windshield wipers then never put them on. Same Valvoline that did $1500 worth damage to my car and wouldn’t give a few free oil changes in exchange. Why do I keep going back
9161 2018-09-09 17:56:21 Happy bdaaay my oil lol
9162 2018-09-09 17:56:13 Because he's a shareholder in a massive oil company.

Not fracking doesn't mean "buy Russian oil"
You could invest in renewables and not ruin the environment and planet.
9163 2018-09-09 17:56:12 step 1. let them grow for about a month. (i know it sucks, but no tweezing or anything) 
step 2. put coconut oil on them 
step 3. after a month, go get them threaded! 
step 4. buy the anastasia dipbrow brush and gel kit.
9164 2018-09-09 17:56:09 Canada does not sell our oil on the world market.... yet.
C.early ypu don't know what you you are talking about.
9165 2018-09-09 17:55:42 Treat it as you would if you were consuming meat. As long as you track your macros it'll be fine. Replace your butter coffee with coconut oil (coffee has to be hot otherwise it clumps). For cooking I use olive or peanut oil. Really good fatty foods are nuts, seeds, and avocado.
9166 2018-09-09 17:55:00 This what we did 2 Africa.The fault is our d west, 1st we went n colonized, next we gave independence with  a puppet leader so he can buy weapons from us. Than d people rebelled the weapons went 2d guerrilla who r mercenaries and buy weapon n ammunition from us in exchange of oil
9167 2018-09-09 17:54:46 Oil Sands Action is your alt account.
9168 2018-09-09 17:54:34 Sister I will ask you one thing.. Why should India keep petrol price low??

Do u know how much crude oil India importing from Iran?

What is the effect of America's CAATSA act on Iran? HOW CAATSA act on Iran Impact India?

What India should do to bring down  Inflation?
9169 2018-09-09 17:54:27 What is oil pulling? What benefits is it supposed to have?
9170 2018-09-09 17:54:26 Dear @RSPO tweets, I am outraged to hear that you continue to credit #palmoil villain, @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s business partner, @Indofood by certifying them. That’s not sustainable palm oil, suspend them now.
9171 2018-09-09 17:54:22 He needs large quantities, not sure if oil will be an efficient solution
9172 2018-09-09 17:54:15 Ayt, I got a beard oil somewhere at home
9173 2018-09-09 17:54:11 that's a lot of oil
9174 2018-09-09 17:53:54 2013 what prize in petrol ?

How many crore in oil bond?  
Tell me the nation.
9175 2018-09-09 17:53:50 Sure? Maybe you think so cause Italy buys spanish oil to sell it as italian oil.
9176 2018-09-09 17:53:43 Vic still licking his wounds. *Sigh*  lmao  3,000,000 and shill still lost. Oh well. Maybe the next time she won't send family members away to war for OIL!!! THEN maybe she'll be elected.... Oh wait, never mind. You're number are scewed. *Sigh*  
9177 2018-09-09 17:53:43 Granjero!!!
9178 2018-09-09 17:53:34 Dear Sir, I think I disagree with "....even revenues'. Agreed Crude Oil is not a major contributor to the GDP but over 70% to the revenues. No other sector is as heavily fiscalized as the Oil sector, Tax rates ranging from 50-85% and other Govt takes such as Royalties, Bonuses,
9179 2018-09-09 17:53:33 One reason why. Oil
9180 2018-09-09 17:53:20 Our neighbour doesn't look after us. We look after each other. When one is skint, the other helps out (aka Union Dividend) eg oil money we put in when we earned more than we spent, and the £13b+ Scotland got this year and last year when we've spent more than we earned.

9183 2018-09-09 17:52:57 If wind and solar are so cheep why do we need to subsidize them? If the issue is global won't the impact be the same if we use the money locally to replace coal and oil?
9184 2018-09-09 17:52:53 Where do you find money to pay the oil bonds issued recklessly by UPA, construct infrastructures and implement numerous schemes of social development which are work in progress?
9185 2018-09-09 17:52:45 Nonsense from the hypocrites who use oil products while disparaging the most responsibly produced oil in the world. How are the Koch bros doing? Who funds your terrorist organization?
9186 2018-09-09 17:52:39 Both your hat and shirt in your bio pic are made using oil. You sir are a hypocrite. Not to mention the gas guzzler pictured behind you. Research is your friend, do some, don't be scared. There are even audio books on it in case you have trouble reading the big words.

9189 2018-09-09 17:52:21 The lack of adequate refineries is entirely due to a lack of investor confidence in the long-term viability of the oil sands.
9190 2018-09-09 17:52:12 Klo ada biaya ya ke dokter kulit. Klo mau hemat ya skincare korea. Toner some by me, trus coba jerawatnya pakein tea tree oil dr the body shop, fw nya pake cetaphile kalau ga innisfree yg bija, jangan lupa double cleansing.

Trs inget klo skincare itu cocok cocokan,
9191 2018-09-09 17:52:10 Why are we not building more refineries where the oil and gas comes out of the ground?

And after products as well.  

Surplus ? Okay  Sell it.  

Think. If China had this problem what would they be doing? Or Ontario ? #cdnpoli
9192 2018-09-09 17:52:08 His oil companies have admitted that Climate change is putting the state underwater but Cruz still won't go there.
9193 2018-09-09 17:51:55 Whom exactly tomorrow's bandh 
is against?

1. Is it against previous UPA govt, who took 2 lakhs Cr loan on account of oil bonds & increased petrol price from Rs.37 to Rs.78 

2. Is it against the state govt who get petrol for Rs.54, add Rs.28 tax &sell it for Rs.82

9199 2018-09-09 17:51:02 Then keep your $. But also keep your bombs, and leave their oil, and stop propping up their dictators.
9200 2018-09-09 17:50:56 There are better ways to spend $10B, in fact, than on the oil & gas industry.
9201 2018-09-09 17:50:35 Or oil

9203 2018-09-09 17:50:22 Straight up my favorite veg. Sliced about 1/3” thick, drizzled with olive oil, a hit of salt & pepper, then sprinkled with Parmigiano Reggiano and roasted til golden. Deeeeeee-licious.
9204 2018-09-09 17:50:13 Fun fact the WORLD still relies on oil products for modern civilization. In fact you are using a product with it right now. Time to walk the talk & give up your modern conveniences so you might have a shred of integrity or credibility.
9205 2018-09-09 17:50:13 Sugar / salt scrubs with heavy coconut oil is my best frienddddddd!

9208 2018-09-09 17:50:06 For smoking #CBD, you can ask your local dispensary for strains with only CBD. Or, ask for the oil and how to use to r act the right level of treatment. I hope you’re in a legal state.
9209 2018-09-09 17:50:04 Thank you Scott & Jon you are both TRUE PATIOT'S & Real American's! Republican's are own by Oil Industry to Koch's & Exxon brought in Putin who owns Trump! Putin picked Tillerson for SOS because Trump never heard of him & He picked Romney!But Russia hates Romney! It's so Obvious!
9210 2018-09-09 17:49:51 Lmao you need to understand and do some research oil has been obsolete since the 1940s but greed won and free energy was stifled tesla figured it out zero point energy is real buddy you arguing oil stats is meaningless this is what you need to know lol
9211 2018-09-09 17:49:48 So my body like really sucks at handing excess oil in food now, and I feel like that means I’m reaching a new level of health, but I love greasy food when I’m drunk so the past two weekends have ended with me throwing up deep fried food after a couple of drinks

9213 2018-09-09 17:49:46 I'm only defending the future of my future generations.
I wouldn't want a PDP mentality to come and squander Nigeria's $992billion (approx. #360 trillion) made from ONLY oil between 1999 to May 29, 2015 AGAIN.
If you know, you know &
If you don't, you might just die of ignorance.
9214 2018-09-09 17:49:22 The menace called almajiri is a waiting time bomb and once it decides to explode, it will have us all as its victims , squarely because we decided to look the other way round when these kids had crowns of fleas and soles with sores.

9217 2018-09-09 17:49:12 Nonsense from oil lobby.  
Reality:
Bitumen + diluent = 3 times the volume of refined crude.
There'd be a lot of open pipeline space if more of AB's bitumen was refined.
Truth: Refineries take decades to pay for themselves & world signed agreement to be off most fossils by 2050.
9218 2018-09-09 17:49:01 To Whom exactly tomorrow’s bandh is against?
1. Is it against previous UPA govt,who took 2 lakhs Cr loan on account of oil bonds & increased petrol price from ₹37 to ₹78
2. Is it against the state govt who get petrol for ₹54,add ₹28 tax &sell it for ₹82 1/2 #BharathBandh

9222 2018-09-09 17:48:08 He must be feeling proud tht he got an audience willing to buy his snake oil
9223 2018-09-09 17:48:05 It’s not about parties it’s about a $500 billion oil deal with Russia that is a COUP. Republicans aren’t in charge-Putin and Netanyahu are in charge
9224 2018-09-09 17:47:49 yeah thick oils like caster oil. but i think pills are fake
9225 2018-09-09 17:47:46 Whom exactly #BharatBandh is against?

Is it against previous #UPA govt
that took 2 lakh cr loan on oil bonds & increased petrol from Rs 37 to 78?

Or

Against #Modi who repaid someone's loan of 2 lakh cr with interest of Rs 70,000cr &
increased petrol cost by juz Rs 5 in 5 yrs?
9226 2018-09-09 17:47:44 Who need their oil changed?              *Hattiesburg area
9227 2018-09-09 17:47:26 Keeping in mind coming General Election, is it not wise for Modi Govt to give subsidy to oil cos for a few months, given d comfortable macro economic indicators @dpradhanbjp Now daily public bashing of d Govt . Ur logic cut d ice with d public

9232 2018-09-09 17:47:17 No. Centre will increase compensation for those state. Oil under gst is possible.

9241 2018-09-09 17:46:27 I wish I'd seen this a month ago, Asha. My dad's family's immigration story is fodder for a movie script. It includes the family of 6, a dog, a car and a trailer coming across the Atlantic on an oil tanker in 1940. It's amazing.

9249 2018-09-09 17:45:34 If GOI decides to bring Oil prices under GST means some State Govts will collapse or will fall. Oppositions will lose ATMs of own State Govt .

9252 2018-09-09 17:45:11 Actually Big Oil supports the hoax. It’s making big dollars off it. We’re fighting for the average Joe.
9253 2018-09-09 17:45:08 There is no Subsidy burden as govt is making approx 100% profit from Oil, reducing 10-15 rs , still govt making 20 rs per litre 
don't defend which people won't buy, rather it will cost you govt
9254 2018-09-09 17:44:58 No big oil salary here sport. Self employed and surviving on my own merit.  Do some research and then get back to me on oil.

9263 2018-09-09 17:43:43 Well, you also need to figure out how you made money when @elonmusk was burning midnight oil in the factory
9264 2018-09-09 17:42:55 I assume that states who don’t run their economies primarily on oil and trucks are not part of “real America”
9265 2018-09-09 17:42:54 my dad just called essential oil “smell sauce”
9266 2018-09-09 17:42:48 Whoever you like. I am no economist, nobody is. So, let it flow. Centre can reduce oil prices, but why should they? Inflation is under control, taxes have reduced. Only because opposition says?
9267 2018-09-09 17:42:40 Alu onions tomatoes r 10-20 per kg. vegetables,Food items&etables cheaper. Ppl r Happy with Modi Govt. Petrol & Diesel prices high due to oil price high in international markets. It will come down.We r ready to commute in public transport. Y congi hv problem?

9272 2018-09-09 17:42:11 High oil prices is a blessing in disguise! We need to think of alternatives to fossil fuel & limit our usage. Calling a #BharatBandh for global oil price hike is just stupidity at best!

9277 2018-09-09 17:41:25 You should have heard our phone conversation. “We heat our oil to 400 so it’s not really an issue anyway...” Followed by a long pause to allow me to pick my chin up off of the floor. Where do they get this idea anyway?

9285 2018-09-09 17:40:14 Endless oil story
9286 2018-09-09 17:40:14 Yes. Oil products plus LNG.
9287 2018-09-09 17:40:13 They own and script the news dude..lybia was a virtual paradise and the people loved him. Gas capped at 10 cents a litre... free vehicle and home when of age...education and healthcare free..he wasn't allowing a central bank or willing to sell oil for petrobucks
9288 2018-09-09 17:40:10 Indian Oil Corporation Ltd  CMP Rs.153.40 (ex bonus) Usually they declare sizable dividend by Feb. Last year(08/02/18), it was 190%  Total dividend for the last year is 210% FV  is Rs.10/-  In 5 months you will get around Rs.1000/- (Ex Bonus ) for Rs.15400/- without much risk
9289 2018-09-09 17:40:03 You had nothing before 2008, and owe everything since to oil money. So yeah — brilliant. 
9290 2018-09-09 17:39:56 I only know what’s going on on the ground, which is people are working 2-3 jobs to make enough money.  No evidence of wages going up... actually with the rising inflation, cost of gas/oil, rising cost of healthcare people are working more jobs
9291 2018-09-09 17:39:46 Envy? Me? No! I work for a supplier to the oil industry!
9292 2018-09-09 17:39:34 A major part of oil price is various taxes that are ploughed back for infrastructure development. So long high oil price does not hurt the common man by increasing inflationary pressure on essential items like foods, medicines etc, one need not worry.
9293 2018-09-09 17:39:16 At Lucas Oil. Last time I was here was the weekend before Zack Jones passed. RIP homie. Miss you every day.

9298 2018-09-09 17:38:41 @ElizabethMay I don’t want to listen to your tripe that new oil from Vancouver will go to US. Oil transported incrementally by the expansion will be going to new markets.

9301 2018-09-09 17:38:23 1,30,000 Cr rupees of unpaid bills of oil companies by previous UPA govt has led to this fuel price hike and now they are protesting against the same. Idiots @INCIndia @BJP4India @RahulGandhi #BharathBandh
9302 2018-09-09 17:38:20 There is no such thing as an ironclad contract. There are always ways out. Especially if you plan early on to use bankruptcy as an escape hatch. If numbered company 2487/10000 owned by Imperial oil becomes insolvent it isn't a big deal to them.
9303 2018-09-09 17:38:17 Interesting location.  I seem to recall this is close to where they supposedly found the "black oil".

9308 2018-09-09 17:37:55 Am I the only one who drinks oil from the bottle?
9309 2018-09-09 17:37:48 Because you can't. A spike after demo and gst was expected. Let it normalise. Govt will utilise it elsewhere. See oil prices in Europe.
9310 2018-09-09 17:37:46 “a LITTLE bit of olive oil” is the italian american version of “TWO shots of vodka”
9311 2018-09-09 17:37:37 Unless you're willing to live life naked in the bushes relying on your smarts you're reliant on oil. 43% of a barrel of crude is used to make fuel, the remaining is used in fabrics, textiles and food. Lead the way Paul.
9312 2018-09-09 17:37:34 When snake oil salesman Obama on his high & mighty teleprompter tells us if we don't vote for unhinged & socialist Dimms things will get worse ! Had to laugh  These people have sunk low enough with their theatrics & tantrums
9313 2018-09-09 17:37:34 I doubt if he will talk about it even, the oil figures

9316 2018-09-09 17:37:28 true, dubya is practically an arab. but they didnt need any - they wanted to keep the oil they had. #oil=#war
9317 2018-09-09 17:37:05 Maybe they're afraid an ally intelligence agency would pick up the conversation... how then could they ever plot against the United States ...Republican allegiances are to money and oil not America.
9318 2018-09-09 17:36:59 Trump. Lack of [insert your preferred aspect] climate finance. Unfair deal for the US. Developed countries' conspiracy. Excuse for developing countries. Coal. Subsidies. Oil lobby. Low trust. Neocolonialism. Capitalism. Russia. IPR. Pick yours & join the #UNFCCC media blame game.
9319 2018-09-09 17:36:46 How much you have your shit together should be determined by how many miles you go without getting an oil change.
9320 2018-09-09 17:36:45 I either smell like old spice or fuel and oil...tragic life

9325 2018-09-09 17:35:58 Okay, boom. Pretty much everything sold out due to the 50% sale soooooooooooo I’ll keep it up only for the 2 oz oil bottles I have left.
9326 2018-09-09 17:35:57 No. I am not going to drive 3000 miles for an oil change
9327 2018-09-09 17:35:56 Why are the Democrats so upset about lower taxs, more oil and gas ,more jobs etc.? What's even more puzzling is why does anybody vote for these Communist Thugs.
9328 2018-09-09 17:35:50 I don’t quite follow. Oil companies would benefit from the status quo, compared to treaties and regulations to cut CO2.
9329 2018-09-09 17:35:49 Ramen has lots of oil so I don't really like it.
9330 2018-09-09 17:35:45 I'm speaking of the oil sands there are no rigs to count.
But the point remains the number of employees required to extract oil has decreased rapidly and will continue to decrease. Fewer and fewer jobs per barrel.
9331 2018-09-09 17:35:45 Lmao, does the rover have a self cleaning mechanism? The metal even looks polished! So many years on the dusty surface of mars and not a spec of dust or even oil droplets from all its mechanical gears and arms. Oh, not to mention the clarity of that mysteriously floating camera..
9332 2018-09-09 17:35:43 I don’t need to personally know him to know he’s an asshat that doesn’t deserve anything. He’s a first class charlatan. A modern day snake oil salesman.

9338 2018-09-09 17:35:03 Ma'am I do agree the crude oil price is low but who will pay back the debt 2 lakh crore due to subsidies created by previous govt. Look at venezula by giving subsidy they have a huge inflation. Namo is trying to payback all the debts plus states get RS 24out of each and every ltr
9339 2018-09-09 17:35:00 What else through out day do you eat or drink?! Any coconut oil put on those
9340 2018-09-09 17:34:58 re-monetise the Oil PSUs. Also problems rankling w/ top suppliers have hurt - renewed sanctions on Iran & d economic upheaval in Socialist Venezuela.

9342 2018-09-09 17:34:51 He will push through C-69 which will delay it again and invite everyone in the world who wants to stop the pipelines in Canada.  Gerry Butts was the fmr director of WWE and has stated NO OIL & GAS IN CANADA WOULD LEAVE THE GROUND.
9343 2018-09-09 17:34:33 How many kids were separated before his watch? How often have we as a country put oil before everything else? What was the amount of the bailout during the last administration? How long as the middle East conflict been going on? Anything else, besides BS?
9344 2018-09-09 17:34:30 When people say to #TaxChurches, I find it to be somewhat ignorant. Sure, sleazy, snake oil selling millionaires like @JoelOsteen should have their extreme wealth taxed, but most #church leaders run small churches and don’t make much. Many of them use donations to help people.

9349 2018-09-09 17:34:04 We understand why he got elected. He's the best damn snake oil salesman since Harold Hill, the Russians were running frauds against the American people to help him get elected, Republicans were suppressing votes wherever they could, and decades of lies about Hillary.
9350 2018-09-09 17:34:02 hahaha hope he doesnt start by saying 
i discovered oil in uganda ....
9351 2018-09-09 17:34:01 I think claiming £4,000 a year expenses for a gardener, claiming mortgage payments for a second home that didn’t have a mortgage or taking bungs off oil giants probably tops anything Boris has said or done. Not to say that @AlanDuncanMP is guilty of any of the above 
9352 2018-09-09 17:34:01 Come let me you a story bout a man named Jed, a poor mountainer barely kept fed, and then one day he was shooting for some food and up through the ground came a bubblying crude, oil that is, black gold, Texas Tea#TrumpSoutherns
9353 2018-09-09 17:34:01  Just looking at your ingredients... There would need to be oil and water too chef.
9354 2018-09-09 17:33:57 Yikes, #palmoil regulator @RSPOtweets is greenwashing @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s business partner @Indofood. RT to tell the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil to punish Indofood for dealing in exploitation palm oil!
9355 2018-09-09 17:33:53 Phew! Of course the offense is coming out now, so Tennessee will get the ball back soon and can try again

9360 2018-09-09 17:33:28 @Rosavecchia  Hi Rosa. Saw your tweets but can't respond to it for some reason. What is the miracle oil that takes your pain away? How can I help?
9361 2018-09-09 17:33:23 I try to stay away from controversy but it is sad that Canada has to import oil from other countries.  I get it, different quality/grades blah blah. Fossil fuel is not going away for many decades to come.  If we want to protect tbe environment, we must support Canada. 
9362 2018-09-09 17:33:21 The secret of happiness is to see all the marvels of the world, and never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon #alchemist
9363 2018-09-09 17:33:00 1) the news has tried to make us believe #Erdogan & Putin have become buddies. Lies. Each has 1 goal...the flow of oil into eastern Europe. They are rivals. We will now begin to see the truth flow out. For Erdogan, shooting down RU jets to protect his border is a first priority.

9368 2018-09-09 17:32:11 The price of petrol in a non B∙J∙P∙ state like Bengal is lesser than the cost of petrol in a B∙J∙P∙ ruled province like महाराष्ट्र. Despite the fact that Mumbai is such a huge port & where most of the oil imports {imports w∙r∙t∙ our country} from the Gulf Nations arrive.
9369 2018-09-09 17:32:10 Americans know about all the earthquakes in Oklahoma caused by fracking and covered up by people like Scott Pruitt.
And of the lives lost & contamination by BP offshore oil drilling.
Some in #txlege have cut what the g&o industry owes to the state to pockets their cut.
9370 2018-09-09 17:31:50 The concentration of essence. Perfume has high oil concetration and lasts longer than colonge
9371 2018-09-09 17:31:46 That depends on what kind of cake you make. I generally include ingredients like whole ground dates and/or agave and/or honey and/or maple syrup as sweetener. I use coconut oil and fresh fruits (bananas, peaches, apples, pumpkins...) Don’t fall victim to that belief.

9374 2018-09-09 17:31:18 People working for oil companies are just as much environmentalists as anyone else and they are concerned/informed about the impacts of what they do. None of them would be in favor of killing anything over profit. They would get fired for it. What is big oil anyway?
9375 2018-09-09 17:31:13 And they always had a bit of oil on them afterward ?

9392 2018-09-09 17:30:02 Cook brown rice(or any rice) separately then fry peppers, onion, mushroom and bacon in butter and oil. Once done add half a cup of water with chicken stock to your fried mixture and add your rice, remove from heat when it starts frying. Hope I make sense

9397 2018-09-09 17:29:48 I love people who are excited about kale! Here is it:
1) Wash & dry some black kale really well - it only works if all the water is gone
2) Brush kale back and front with sunflower oil using a silicon bruch
3) Sprinkle with salt & pepper to taste
4) 10 min @ 180C, turning halfway
9398 2018-09-09 17:29:45 Alu onions tomatoes r  Rs.10 to 20 per kg. All food items & etable r cheaper. Petrol& Diesel prices r high due to high oil prices in international markets. We r ready to commute in public transport till oil price come down. Why congi have problem?

9402 2018-09-09 17:29:17 Tea tree oil is magic
9403 2018-09-09 17:29:16 Rig activity is the predominant barometer for oil and gas activity.
9404 2018-09-09 17:29:09 Bread drizzled with olive oil is carb heaven 
9405 2018-09-09 17:28:58 This dude next to me in the parking lot at Walmart just put oil in his windshield washer fluid. So im going to just sit this one out and let natural selection do it's thing.
9406 2018-09-09 17:28:54 Pipelines that we know not are running beneath us moving oil and products to places we know not. Amazingly, we also now have earth tremor that we know not. Who is tampering with our soil in ways that we know not?
9407 2018-09-09 17:28:49 d'un point de vue dette pétrolière en France, et peut-être d'un point de vue peak oil du conventionnel derrière nous.
9408 2018-09-09 17:28:44 Whom exactly #BharatBandh is against?

Is it against previous UPA govt
that took 2 lakh cr loan on oil bonds & increased petrol from Rs 37 to 78?

Or

Against the man who repaid someone's loan of 2 lakh cr with interest of Rs 70,000cr &
increased petrol cost by juz Rs 5 in 5 yrs?

9410 2018-09-09 17:28:36 Trudeau is running around in Global citizen t-shirt 
Handing out billions of taxpayers money to other countries.
Flooding our country with migrants,killing our oil sector,killing trade deals with his progressive left ideas .
Destroying relationships, Saudi, India , China , USA,
9411 2018-09-09 17:28:28 THE OIL DIESEL PRICE HIKE IS NOT DUE TO MODI, ITS DUE TO STRONGER USA $. INTERNATIONAL SITUATION CAN NOT BE CONTROLLED BY INDIA,
9412 2018-09-09 17:28:26 Everyone talking about his idiot minority base which did not get him elected..we need to be focused on the 200 or so rich old white men that jacked America. Remember the $500  billion Russian oil coup and strategic planning of putin and Netanyahu elected him.
9413 2018-09-09 17:28:18 Denmark has gdp of about £230 to 270 billion a year with oil reserves. In reality don’t think Denmark and Wales are comparable.
9414 2018-09-09 17:28:16 Every recession since 50's brought to us by GOP thru policies like yours. Trickle down is a farce. Greed over love & responsibility for country is pervasive illness among GOP & corp wrld. Midclass t'ers are beginning to feel the pain & it will only get worse. Snake oil.
9415 2018-09-09 17:28:05 Also, we are kind of letting it be experimented with in Rojava. Though it’s too early (and complicated by war and oil) to make any judgements

9420 2018-09-09 17:27:33 With lasting memories of a trip that exceeded expectations, thanks for asking. Our players are growing ever better and Klopp has them playing beautiful football. Trophies will follow. Your plastic bandwagon of a club went from joke to champions thanks to one thing — oil money. 
9421 2018-09-09 17:27:18 Belly of the beast says cbc. Such disrespect for AB. Albertans fed up with Lib/eastern/CBC. Phase out oil and gas says JT. Leave it in the ground say NDP. Alberta should demand independence. #ABEXIT
9422 2018-09-09 17:27:10 They went digging strange places searching for oil, suddenly we now hear earth tremor. Connect the dots.
9423 2018-09-09 17:27:01 Ugh. Getting an oil change
9424 2018-09-09 17:26:59 Your lame justification was that Philippines don't have oil. So, they have to go for nuclear energy. That's invalid because Philippines have close to zero Uranium ore. In short you're just piggy headed and will grasp at any straw, however frail.
9425 2018-09-09 17:26:27 Oil pulling is great
9426 2018-09-09 17:26:16 You're right, he was a tyrant, and he probably only used oil theft (which Kuwait admitted and offered $9Billion in compensation) as an excuse to invade. He was never going to accept a border drawn by Brits once he'd failed to take territory from Iran. 1/2
9427 2018-09-09 17:26:12 The UK and Norway import oil? Has his lay whoever she is, heard of North Sea oil? She needs to get her facts right.

9431 2018-09-09 17:25:41 That & a whole host of other reasons is why I take 50x the recommended daily dose of vitamin D, everyday. 50k+UI per day along with a mix of other vitamins, amino acids & nootropic compounds. Oh and some cannabis oil wouldn't help...
9432 2018-09-09 17:25:24 In Oil, add hing, mustard seeds, kadhi patta green chillis. After onions turn golden, add tomatoes, cook them well, add turmeric, salt, little bit sugar, soaked poha and cook them with lid on. Add lime, coriander and done.
9433 2018-09-09 17:25:20 Cannibalism is evil. Can you and BBC now report on the ongoing GENOCIDE of Hebrew Biafra in Nigeria by the British govt and their jihadists to steal oil and gas. AMALGAMATION 1914 to 2014 to steal oil and gas has expired. REFERENDUM SOLVES THE GENOCIDE!.
9434 2018-09-09 17:25:18 Oh really? Oil was at 36 dollars a barrel in 2016 now it’s at 70 I believe. We’re actually bringing jobs back from overseas and Obama himself said “this jobs aren’t coming back”. Our production is almost triple in oil then it was under Obama.
9435 2018-09-09 17:25:18 I ate a pint of chunky monkey last night and puffed my oil pen all night
9436 2018-09-09 17:24:57 Try to go as much organic as possible.  Organic Olive oil from Asda, is one the ingredients that helped me with my health and my depression.  It is a very high quality oil.  I can give you a detailed nutrition advice for depression if you are interested. I have been there.
9437 2018-09-09 17:24:51 has anyone tried sunday riley ufo oil??
9438 2018-09-09 17:24:38 I know this is an old post but coconut oil is great and tastes and smells nice too 
9439 2018-09-09 17:24:38 Nobody profits from a spill which is why they continue to innovate/improve. Oil producers pay to ship their product in pipelines and rail cars. The pipeline and rail companies are responsible for any spills. 10-15% spill recovery does not meet any legal requirement.
9440 2018-09-09 17:24:32 US gas shipped to Europe is 30% more expensive than Russian gas.

The #NordStream conflict is about Europe forming an alliance with Russia and also Russia's trade in oil for gold payment (#PetroGold) with China.

9441 2018-09-09 17:24:27 Are you okay?
9442 2018-09-09 17:24:22 The good news is that Oil | Stone | Water has been extended until September 23rd. So if you haven't had the chance to see our current show, this gives you more time to plan a visit to Lunenburg!

9443 2018-09-09 17:24:19 Be bold to buy oil from Iran, don't be afraid of US, we can kick them if they come between us and Iran.
9444 2018-09-09 17:24:14 I use baby wipes to take it off my paws and then baby powder my paws to dry them before diapering. I do the same with baby oil too. The paw powdering is the important part. It absorbs and neutralises all the oil and cream that otherwise ruins tab pulling.

9446 2018-09-09 17:23:44 Nonsense. Almost consider the prices of bread and other commodities. Venezuela is basket economy despite having oil. All due to stupid communism and socialism and the bloodthirsty Communist.
9447 2018-09-09 17:23:37 "there is 4.5B Tons of Iranium[sic] in the ocean". Yeah. All you have to do is sift through 1.5 Bn Bn tons of H20 to get it. If that were easy everyone would do just that. By the same reasoning oil being nothing else than alkenes which are also all around, you have plenty of oil.
9448 2018-09-09 17:23:37 Government came up with oil deregulation few years before which means change in crude oil prices will lead to direct change in petrol or diesel..Before this government used to fix petrol or diesel prices and pay subsidy to oil companies in case of losses.
9449 2018-09-09 17:23:31 USA “oil crisis” years old.  Lines for gas stations lasting an hour.

9451 2018-09-09 17:23:27 the same price which you say in 2013 was because of crude oil hovering at $130 per barrel. Now crude oil per barrel is Just at $80. so your comparison is dumb.
9452 2018-09-09 17:23:21 Peak oil. I think that is the biggest threat looming over everything else. We are "frackheads" that haven't found a way to get off of our addiction. The impact will make even a hard Brexit look soft.
9453 2018-09-09 17:23:06 Marinate the liver in olive oil and add in a few pinches of salt and little vinegar, let sit for a few hours. Helps eliminate some of the gamey-ness

9456 2018-09-09 17:22:45 No one wants to buy your olive oil, Kyle
9457 2018-09-09 17:22:45 Better than gas, insurance, tires, brakes, oil changes, and speeding tickets.
9458 2018-09-09 17:22:42 Ni olive oil
9459 2018-09-09 17:22:33 Ah. I recommend: warm milky drink before bed (chemical reaction), lavender essential oil on pillow, blackout blinds & curtains, silicone earplugs, white noise machine, lumie bodyclock to wake in the morning (mimics sunrise so no need to hear through earplugs) x
9460 2018-09-09 17:22:29 1. @HillaryClinton accepted for the creation of ISIS.
2. Russia has warned that US has planned another chemical attack in Iraq.
3. Problem is US wanted all OIL in the world that is mostly in Middle East. So US itself created 9/11 plot and supporting the proved alleged country KSA
9461 2018-09-09 17:22:25 I agree. WW2 was necessary. Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria are/were not.
Rich men send poor men to war for oil, money & geopolitical reasons, absolutely nothing to do with democracy or defending anyone.
9462 2018-09-09 17:22:23 Lea, I don’t care about your gross avocado toast flaxseed oil crap, just tell us wtf’s going on, a bitch needs sleep.

9464 2018-09-09 17:21:58 Bhai check karlo Congress ke Raj me crude oil ka kya bhav thav aur Abhi kya he you will know the difference ki Modi Raj me kitna % increase hua he petrol.
9465 2018-09-09 17:21:57 Hope u will accept the fact that collecting money through taxes is not a loot.its a way to increase money for the development of India.
1. How would infra develop?
2. How wud villages get electrified?
3. How wud India become renewable reliant?
4. How can we stop depending on oil?
9466 2018-09-09 17:21:44 I use a Nars foundation when I wear it and I don’t hate it but my skin is so combination that no matter what I use it either melts off my skin with the oil or shows off all my dry spots!!!!
9467 2018-09-09 17:21:24 Any idea of what's causing it? I get that sometimes when my finger joints swell (like now), icing helps, as does heavy moisturizing (oil or vaseline), last resort some kind of numbing cream with lidocaine (plus oral meds for the swelling, ofc)

9470 2018-09-09 17:21:18 There is a stadium in Indiana that has the capacity of 70,000 but they aren’t going to the stadium. It’s named Lucas Oil Stadium. They should be going because they deserve it. I live in Indiana but I’m traveling 4 hours to go see them in Chicago! They should come! @BigHitEnt

9473 2018-09-09 17:21:04 You forget about de-manning? Activities have returned to pre 2014 levels but employment numbers are down. Because the oil cos don't want to pay people when they can buy a robot instead. Don't expect 6 fig salaries to stick around. Once they deman enough they can hire cheaper.

9475 2018-09-09 17:20:34 At last wk rally in Montana & Dakotas, Trump proudly said oil pipeline was going thru, ; he stopped demonstrations. ANOTHER LIE - the pipeline gas been suspended based on a court ruling. That's s why demos ceased. 2 LIES in 30 seconds, 
9476 2018-09-09 17:20:24 The well oiled machine at the WH needs an oil change. Kelly and Javanka have always been at odds. The rats are eating each other!
9477 2018-09-09 17:20:18 Venezuela was doing pretty well ten years ago before the USA initiated economic warfare against the country and the price of oil came way down. That makes a big difference for a country that depends heavily on one export.
9478 2018-09-09 17:20:07 Bingo. Think about it: Tillerson, Steele 19.5%, Trump has 2X tried to sell of the US SPR and get Saudis to break OPEC rules. Look at a map of where all those Congressmen who have gone to RU are from. All from center of US/oil producing and refining states.
9479 2018-09-09 17:20:05 Thank you #caleg and @SenHannahBeth, @AsmMuratsuchi and @JerryBrownGov for your leadership to protect California’s communities, economy, and ocean wildlife from expanded offshore oil drilling. #SB834 #AB1775 #ProtectthePacific #DrillingIsKilling

9481 2018-09-09 17:20:00 Not at all... He got the idea from Maxim's Paris or a pharmacy... Whale liver oil is a source of Omega 3, in gelatin capsules 

You think God would cook any specialty causing low density lipoprotein?
9482 2018-09-09 17:19:36 There’s a 3-4 week lag between the time crude oil arrives at a port and when refined products are dispensed. The rise in prices justified on basis of falling rupee are not justified on price of crude. More looting of the public.
9483 2018-09-09 17:19:35 Nigeria :

9490 2018-09-09 17:18:28 True! Just be careful to keep the oil out of their eyes and nose. You can use a cotton swab around the head, too.
9491 2018-09-09 17:18:28 The oil money is running out. They couldn't afford the expensive/useless electric vehicle.
9492 2018-09-09 17:18:19 Time for that oil change 
9493 2018-09-09 17:18:02 I’m talking the ones who lost passport so can’t ever visit. Moms is hospital, needs money for operation, lost wallet, needs money. They ALL work on oil rigs for some reason 
9494 2018-09-09 17:18:01 Lisa Murkowski voted for the tax bill only if it contained a provision that opened up Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling. That was something her daddy, a former U.S. senator and Governor of Alaska, had unsuccessfully worked for. Worth lots of money to her.
9495 2018-09-09 17:18:00 Guessing Exxon and Putin want sanctions lifted on oil in the Arctic Ocean oil fields.  Trump over an oil barrel.  But why do we even have to guess what they're doing?
9496 2018-09-09 17:18:00 You are a good persons
9497 2018-09-09 17:17:58 Sunday morning is THE best time to get an oil change. I took my wife's minivan to a local oil change service. In and out in 10 minutes. This business lived up to its name!
9498 2018-09-09 17:17:53 Olip oil ternyata wkwkwk
9499 2018-09-09 17:17:50 Shell will then buy oil from China? Won't that upset he Muslims?
9500 2018-09-09 17:17:32 try tea tree oil? sometimes it helps.
9501 2018-09-09 17:17:32 उस oil bond के बारे में भी बताए जिसे भरकर कांग्रेस ने ईरान से कर्ज लिया और चुनाव लड़ें जिसे अब मोदी सरकार सूद सहित चुका रही है। जनता 2019 मे कांग्रेस का अगवाडा पिछवाड़ा सब बंद कर देगी।
9502 2018-09-09 17:17:29 Idiot who left unpaid oil debt of 2 lakh crores?
9503 2018-09-09 17:17:25 Whom exactly #BharatBandh is against?

Is it against previous UPA govt
that took 2 lakh cr loan on oil bonds & increased petrol from Rs 37 to 78?

Or

Against the man who repaid someone's loan of 2 lakh cr with interest of Rs 70,000cr &
increased petrol cost by juz Rs 5 in 5 yrs
9504 2018-09-09 17:17:20 I cannot believe Minnesota traded That QB from last year.

9506 2018-09-09 17:17:10 Plus, in the case of Norway, what you kept in the way of oil reserves (which now pay for everyone's pensions) instead of selling off to fund tax cuts for rich in 80s!
9507 2018-09-09 17:17:07 Very good suggestion, immediately all oil marketing companies instruct petrol/diesel pumps to display all taxes in detail for public to know what they are paying for fuel to centre and state and dealer
9508 2018-09-09 17:17:07 and Mr. @SaeedGhani1  should he bring the bottle of honey and oil ?? i mean app tu har raat wahan 2 bottle lay ke jatay hongay /

9514 2018-09-09 17:16:40 Actually, if you could produce a convincing rebuttal of something like the GHE, then oil company science departments would snap you up before you could say ‘knife’. They pay a heck of a lot more than govt. labs and universities and have great career prospects.

9544 2018-09-09 17:13:02 We manage to produce a tremendous amount of oil and natural gas for export. We export lots of other things as well. Why can’t we do this with phones.
9545 2018-09-09 17:12:54 It's funny: Menem signed a resource sharing agreement that would have seen Argentina get a share of oil revenue.  Kirchner tore it up.
Argentina's refusal to take their case to the ICJ shows that they don't believe they have any case.
9546 2018-09-09 17:12:51 It's all about oil for @lisamurkowski. She could give a crap about long term environmental damage.

9556 2018-09-09 17:12:16 But if imperial oil sets up AB567748848 LTD  to hold the TOB contracts and the company is sold off, spun off, or taken public the liability becomes someone else's problem. And historically that's been how these companies operate.
9557 2018-09-09 17:12:07 All big lies like your leaders.The nation is still paying the debt raised by issuing oil bonds by UPA worth 2lac crores.

9595 2018-09-09 17:06:34 Indeed after second oil shock of Iranian crisis Britain focused on its exploration in its own premises and fortunately they found abundant oil in North sea at one point Britain though of being Non Opec leader of oil producers.
9596 2018-09-09 17:06:33 Instead of clearing the Oil Bonds & Interest Charges, had the Govt used the oil profits to create the Oil Price Stabilization Fund, today, the Govt would have had the cushion to stabilize Retail Prices. Such basics, not taught at Harvards?

9599 2018-09-09 17:06:21 No PR photos of you will EVER change the fact that you are a greedy science denier who hold allegiance to big oil/gas/chem/coal. Your policies are harmful to environment and ushering in dangerous climate change.
9600 2018-09-09 17:06:18 But they didn't brought oil bonds to cheat people of country.Congress needs to explain why raised this burden to be paid latter
9601 2018-09-09 17:06:01 I oppose the #BharathBandh called by @INCIndia n other political parties who are misleading d nation by hiding abt d Oil Bonds burden of UPA Govt.

BTW tomorrow I am working as usual without supporting so called #BharatBandh

9605 2018-09-09 17:05:02 Election date can be announced shortly but any way oil prices reduced
9606 2018-09-09 17:04:55 $100 oil changes gone be the death of me
9607 2018-09-09 17:04:42 Schalke - Massive investment from Russian oil, hasn't relegated in almost 30 years
Leverkusen - Corporate backed by huge German company, 40 years since relegation
Tottenham - Hasn't relegated in 40 years, only came close once 25 years ago
Leicester City is the one outlier
9608 2018-09-09 17:04:40 @PMOIndia karnatka me oil prise hike karte hea jabtumne etne se din me tax incrise kar dia he govt kese clati he malum ho kaya

9610 2018-09-09 17:04:20 The World Trade Organization has stated that the twentieth century started with wars for oil, but that in the twenty-first century we will see wars for water.
9611 2018-09-09 17:04:05 How did we come to accept that the U.S. military fights for a flag and a song? Granted, oil and $$ aren’t much better, but at least it’s the truth.
9612 2018-09-09 17:03:57 Thought all day yesterday that I was going to make some homemade Buffalo chicken tenders for the Titans game. Well got all the stuff ready and I don’t have any oil to fry them. Taco’s and beer it is. #TitanUp
9613 2018-09-09 17:03:44 I wish i see it again, it’s one that was captioned “legs”. One babe with plenty groundnut oil on her body putting on a black pant. Loooooool
9614 2018-09-09 17:03:42 Dearie me, it’s not difficult. At the moment the EU is our largest trading partner. Once we get Indy, England will be our largest trading partner. Unless of course ur saying England won’t buy our electricity, water, oil, whisky, foodstuffs etc. out of spite. Are they that petty?
9615 2018-09-09 17:03:41 Centre must reduce the custom duty increased, when crude oil price in the international markets were down. State governments & UTs must reduce the VAT. Both Delhi & Chandigarh UTs, then why Delhites are paying more for petro products than Chandigarh? Kejriwal Ji please answer?
9616 2018-09-09 17:03:40 The oil crisis was "manageable"; but had huge economic effects.
9617 2018-09-09 17:03:32 It might be a good bike ... if only we could be sure that the oil pressure were consistent.
9618 2018-09-09 17:03:29 Ignorant how? I’m fully aware that my customers don’t want beef/pork gelatine, but I waste precious hours of my understaffed day explaining that cod liver oil tablets will not say vegetarian on them because it has fish in it.
9619 2018-09-09 17:03:27 Pure THC. No sticks. No dirt. Pure marijuana in oil form. What is the problem?
9620 2018-09-09 17:03:21 Iran was not paid
But Indians were charged for petrol. So where did the money go 

Then subsidy was given to keep petrol prices under control
Where did the money go.

Still you took oil bonds where did the money go.

9624 2018-09-09 17:02:46 Is Petrol price the sole criterion to relect a Govt.?
If so what prevents Modi Govt. from issuing oil bonds as UPA2 did to cool down petrol prices?
9625 2018-09-09 17:02:42 Whom exactly tomorrow’s bandh is against?

1. Is it against previous #UPA govt, who took 2 lakhs Cr loan on account of oil bonds & increased petrol price from ₹37 to ₹78

2. Is it against the state govt who get petrol for ₹54,add ₹28 tax & sell it for ₹82 .

9633 2018-09-09 17:01:14 अगर crude oil और $ vs. ₹ के दाम शनिवार और रविवार को बंद रहते है तो पेट्रोल व डीजल के दाम कैसे बढ जाते है?

9636 2018-09-09 17:01:04 2019 should be a choice between:

Successful schemes like..
1. Doorstep delivery of ration/Govt school reforms/Mohalla clinics/CCTV project..

AND

Flop schemes like..
2. DeMo/NPA writeoffs of super-rich/Rafale/WeakestRupee/Highest Oil Prices/SmartCities/SwachhBharat..
9637 2018-09-09 17:00:59 Ashu bhai, this mean 2 big big frauds, one, understating fiscal deficit by not getting oil bonds on govt balance sheet, two, printing more notes than recorded on RBI BS. This, literally is treachery towards the nation, harward PM, FM were smart enough to pull these frauds
9638 2018-09-09 17:00:49 They are indeed, mixture of the stock artrage oil brush and Paolo's fantastic daub set.
9639 2018-09-09 17:00:41 Crude oil price is still 30% lower than 2014 price level, but Petrol and Diesel is at all time high. Which math is working?
Should the common men bear the pinch due to utter failure of Govt to control falling rupee?

9651 2018-09-09 16:59:38 1870's commercialisation of oil; Holy Roman and 1880's definition of corporatism; all those dividends gushing into German imperial Holy Roman bank accounts could only mean one thing. A protracted war on independent republics from the 1890's on to today. #History

9656 2018-09-09 16:58:53 Syria doesn't have much oil. They do have the Euphrates river, however, and all of Israel's fresh water flows into Israel from Lebanon & Syria. Israel, with large agri/horticulture industry is running low on H2O & that's what the Syrian so-called 'civil war' is really about.

9682 2018-09-09 16:57:03 The problem here is you’re outlawing plot holes to a point of dogmatic absurdity. Plot holes are not inherently bad. You have to be able to sell them. Some work, some don’t.

9690 2018-09-09 16:55:59 In a globalised world(uncontrolled economy) these kind of things are common and this also reflects the government failure to built up its unexploited oil reserves. Building up oil reserves takes time, hence congress in addition to bjp needs to take the blame here.Not only bjp

9692 2018-09-09 16:55:38 What was Congress party doing in 2015 when Crude oil came down to 26$ per barrel in international market? Why it didn't put pressure on Government at that time to reduce prices? Why no Bharat bandh at that time? #BharatBandh

9699 2018-09-09 16:55:02 The people should support the proposed #BharatBandh tommorow not only bcoz hike in oil & gas prices but more bcoz of the general inflation prices in respect of all household goods. Modi Govt is the biggest hypocrite see the flash back when they are in opposition!

9708 2018-09-09 16:53:59 Funny....except this is the direction they are going. Isn't it a segment of fanbase screaming for Faulk (or similar) but Oil have resisted?
9709 2018-09-09 16:53:53 What u think #RiseForClimate means:
- Stop evil oil CEOs
- Unleash powerful wind/solar energy
- Less extreme weather

What #RiseForClimate actually means:
- Tax & gas price hikes
- Unaffordable electric bills
- Unreliable power for u, hospitals, etc
- No change in weather events
9710 2018-09-09 16:53:42 Bottom line. Crypto space is being diluted with new blockchain every day, making all of it less valuable. Too much gold= less price lower, too much oil=price lower,too much blockchain= price lower.

9723 2018-09-09 16:52:42 how did i choose my outfit this morning? well i was really inspired by the “oil slick” sheen on the neck of a pigeon.

9728 2018-09-09 16:52:17 RT if you didnt know what krishna oil was when you started to live in chennai
9729 2018-09-09 16:52:16 ...unless you seriously think oil companies in Latin America have a history of doing things in a legal, just, and/or moral way.
9730 2018-09-09 16:52:14 where else can todays millenials get all their apps, milkshakes, cbd oil whilst taking home a hefty 17k p.a. salary from their content aggregation web media job that they beat out 30 other applicants for, all of em also havin masters degrees in english. *It Might Be Milton Keynes
9731 2018-09-09 16:52:00 Our problems were far from just internal. The Commonwealth - out of our control - had proved far from an economic replacement for the Empire (we did control); OPEC cartel problems that led to the oil crisis, threatened petrol rationing, phases power blackouts, 3 day week...
9732 2018-09-09 16:51:55 I'm 10 pounds underweight. That's not any better. There is a very broad range for healthy weight, and celebrating either extreme is dangerous.
9733 2018-09-09 16:51:36 Modi saved India by paying off the Oil bonds
9734 2018-09-09 16:51:29 Cong or anay party BJP ko badnam karne ke liye koi mauka nahi chhodna chahta hai,Election ka samay najdik araha hai.oil or gas janta ko dukhi kar raha hai.
9735 2018-09-09 16:51:20 I need new tires, I need my oil changed, my check engine light just came on, anddddd I have to make my car payment......... and I need to book my flight for El Paso and get a gown for the military ball. I. AM. STRESSED. 
9736 2018-09-09 16:51:17 Every time I go to get a simple oil change or something I get scared they’re gonna ask me to do other things. Please let’s just focus on the task at hand
9737 2018-09-09 16:51:00 How do mechanics ALWAYS find shit wrong with your car....  just give me my damn oil change and tire rotation.
9738 2018-09-09 16:50:58 TODAY is EXACTLY 107 days to CHRISTMAS

You see you've sorted out for the Christmas.

9740 2018-09-09 16:50:36 Just been to watch our lasses take on Derby at Pride Park. Bastards escorted me from the ground for tryin to get into the Forest changing room after the game. Apparently baby oil & a zoom lens are not required to offer my commiserations?
9741 2018-09-09 16:50:35 That's not how it works.
9742 2018-09-09 16:50:29 You have to wonder. Why isn't this happening in Bolivia? Or Iran? Now Iran has been under extreme sanctions for years. Sanctions against Venezuela only started getting serious less than a year ago.They are nowhere near as extreme as those against Venezuela. We still buy their oil
9743 2018-09-09 16:50:24 Back scratching is a gateway to full on baby oil massage.
9744 2018-09-09 16:50:15 Seems fortune plays important part in Modi's performance according to u. Like crude oil prices dropped very low n Modi took credit. When they increased, it's global problem. Such rationalising is false n bluff Will b called.

9746 2018-09-09 16:50:04 Clary sage is now my favourite essential oil. It smells sooo good. I use it in my aroma diffuser every night. It gives the room such a relaxing vibe. 

Do you use essential oils? If so, what is your favourite?

9750 2018-09-09 16:49:41 Because the global oil prices are rising. India being an importer has to spend more now to procure the oil.
9751 2018-09-09 16:49:40 The postman is playing my copy.
I'm playing Just Cause 3 while I wait patiently.
Totally patiently.
Not manically blowing up oil rigs and mowing down swathes of innocent henchmen in frustration.
Just waiting patiently.
9752 2018-09-09 16:49:38 Been on a hunt for cheap canvases and oil paint lately. Not going well. 
9753 2018-09-09 16:49:34 Haha never needed to change the oil as the valve stems leaked so badly it burnt about 1 litre every 3 days! Constant fresh oil! 

Nope never except the crossers i had as a kid.

9757 2018-09-09 16:49:21 Will it be water cooled ? Have u ever build a pc dipped in oil with fishes in it
9758 2018-09-09 16:49:17 I'm no fan of #Boris but the arrogant Tory Establishment is defying the will of the people. "Sir" Alan Duncan used the Right to Buy programme to make profits on property deals. He also worked for a criminal oil trader.
9759 2018-09-09 16:49:09 みんなオイルが好きだよね⁇あん⁇嫌い⁇嫌いとか言うならオイル使われてる食品も製品も食べるなよ使うなよwwwwww? ガソリンもオイルだよ⁇www 車も乗るなよwww? 野菜だけ食ってろよwwww ベジタリアンテラワロスwwwwwww
9760 2018-09-09 16:48:59 Best way for that is to improve public transport, which is way behind its time, especially in metros, that takes time, and money both. Plus, govt actively working on EVs which should reduce dependency on oil as well

9778 2018-09-09 16:47:24 It sounds like the best possible spin on still running 8b/year deficits while oil is at $70/brrl. Most of us realize this some of us like yourself don't.
9779 2018-09-09 16:47:12 oh everyone got it, then oil companies started making sure that certain people started to un-get it

9784 2018-09-09 16:46:54 Instead of fixing the economy through cheese imports we need to re-negotiate Qatar LNG and Gas contracts, hire highly qualified people who can interpret longterm effects on economy of long term high value contracts i.e CPEC, Oil and LNG contracts.
9785 2018-09-09 16:46:43 week of 9/10: positioned for US stagflation-bear flattening yield curve $TLT bullish but oil bullish also. we already saw margins/growth of large companies start to decline in Q2 ( $FB etc). looking for inflation protected risk off wo exposure to hurting EMs (ie not most staples)

9801 2018-09-09 16:44:38 You don’t need the expensive products that purport to feed our hair. You can mix things at home for yourself and have a great Afro. Don’t wash your hair everyday - once a week is ok, condition well,  nourish with your preferred oil combo.
9802 2018-09-09 16:44:16 Exactly what Trudeau,Butts and and Notley want. The oil in the ground.
9803 2018-09-09 16:43:56 Can you substitute butter for oil in bread making?
9804 2018-09-09 16:43:46 Actually all hose shoppers are governed by those rules, it just has nothing to do with the shipping. You think CNRL ($40 BLN mkt cap), Suncor ($64 bLN mkt cap), Imperial Oil, the Alberta Government will go out of business and not be able to pay their fees?

9808 2018-09-09 16:42:51 My guy, the bill is extreme, but protecting kids and the water supply from the harmful effects of the oil industry is more important than oil jobs. There are other fields of work but only one planet.
9809 2018-09-09 16:42:51 For current increase the reason is crude oil is increasing in global market due to various political reasons involving USA,  IRAN, SAUDI, QATAR, RUSSIA, BRAZIL & VENEZUELA. Wn v import, v nd 2 pay in $. As the rupee is depreciating against $, v need to pay more in rupees.
9810 2018-09-09 16:42:48 SORRY. CORN FIRST, OIL SECOND. YOU CAN START A FIRE IF YOU ADD OIL TO ANYTHING TO A POPCORN POPPER.
9811 2018-09-09 16:42:43 Go to Dischem or your supermarket nje for the oils. It’s the same oil we cook with. Mix equal parts of the oils, and a jar or 2 of the Jabu Stone beeswax. Hlukana impela ne hot hairdryer. Let your hair dry naturally if you don’t have a cold air dryer. Be patient.
9812 2018-09-09 16:42:41 Our domestic crude production by ONGC abd OIL etc is limited hence necessitating import of crude oil from other nations. International crude oil prices are dependent on many other aspects besides OPEC mechanisms

Nothing is a miracle product, but many people are desperate to find a solution beyond the use of pain medication.

9865 2018-09-09 16:37:51 That's because Saudi Arabia is willing to do business with us, is richer than Iran, sells its oil in US dollars, and will pay handsomely for our military weapons.

9868 2018-09-09 16:37:24 Gee, look everyone: The oil company that admitted to deliberately dumping billions of gallons of toxic waste in the Amazon (for profit) and refuses to clean up is sending messages out from a “Corporate Social Responsibility” platform! @Chevron has no shame. Pathetic.

Previous Congress govt took 2 lakh cr loan on oil bonds & increased petrol from Rs 37 to 78? BJP govt repaid Congress loan of 2 lakh cr with interest of Rs 70,000cr & increased petrol cost by juz Rs 5 in 5 yrs? Don't Support #BharatBandh.

That is why people of India had chosen BJP. But they r worse than them.

Do you know, that time Crude oil per barrel was $110 , Now it is $70.

That time center was taking Rs. 9 tax in petrol, now it is Rs.19 tax.

9893 2018-09-09 16:34:09 See it has got more to do with increase in crude oil prices and depreciating rupee, increase in demand for fuel. All citizens have got their part in the price rise. BharatBandh is not going to change anything. May further depreciate rupee value.

10000 2018-09-09 16:19:58 Make your own! Simplest thing in the world and saves a fortune. Almost all bar soap contains palm oil too which I wont have in the house.
10001 2018-09-09 16:19:58 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.

10005 2018-09-09 16:19:37 Almost like there is a glut of heavy oil. 
Heavy oils take more time and energy to refine into useful things. The heavy metals, sulphur, and other toxic crap needs to be disposed of. I'm just saying these things make ours less attractive since ours is full of trash.

10011 2018-09-09 16:18:43 Ya get what ya vote for. In this case he stomped on his dick by being stupid, by taken in by a flashy snake oil salesman. I have zero sympathy for anyone who followed  or is following Comrade Bonespur.
10012 2018-09-09 16:18:41 This the type of shit the us need to send are forces in to stop rather than trying to steal oil and shit cause un forces sit and let it happen
