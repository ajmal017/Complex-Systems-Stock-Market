35 2018-12-11 23:47:57 There is still an extremely bullish outcome not readily apparent. PADD3 inventories once they're gone will limit US export capacity. While PADD2 cannot get its stocks out, may even keep building. This will leave the water short oil. Speed of draws + Jan exports are key.

41 2018-12-11 23:46:16 I got wiped out 98% during the 2001 Dotcom crash and barely survived the 2008 banking crash as well when I was buying so much banks stocks during the crash.  Once the bear cycle is done and we rebound back, those that had the courage to buy in this crash will reap the rewards.

51 2018-12-11 23:38:42 European stocks rose on Tuesday despite further uncertainty in France and the UK, in part from a boost in autos. @Volkswagen surged 3.6%, @Daimler jumped 3.4% and @BMW gained 2.7%.
52 2018-12-11 23:38:09 Healthcare stocks saw a mixed performance as Abbott Labs jumped 1.3%, @Celgene rose 1.2%, Baxter and @Amgen advanced 1.1%, and Johnson & Johnson gained 0.9%, while @Pfizer slid 0.6% after its rating was downgraded by an investment bank.
53 2018-12-11 23:36:47 US stocks mostly fell on Tuesday in a session that saw the key indices weave in and out of positive territory – with the Dow Jones and S&P 500 ending slightly lower and the NASDAQ slightly higher

70 2018-12-11 23:24:59 Hi there. Unfortunately, the Little Shop Christmas Edition is while-stocks-last campaign, therefore there was a limited supply. We're aware of the issue of reselling and are currently working to resolve this issue. We're sorry for the hassle.
71 2018-12-11 23:24:05 Makes no sense re:ETFs. What’s implied is ETFs may have more exposure to China than any of the individual stocks mentioned. You have to be a fool to think that ATT has no exposure to China.I think Cramer is obsessed over the alpha that he can’t see the smartness of ETF beta

73 2018-12-11 23:22:53 What I meant was that most DIY investors don't keep up with their strategy. For example; they would have sold in 2015 and 2016 flash corrections. This is why they can't beat the market by selecting stocks. If you stay invested, you will beat the market (with both ETF and stocks)

106 2018-12-11 23:02:06 I text some friends last night about what Uranium stocks I like for this next year.  Gave a list and at the end included $wuc $wstrf as being back to levels I would consider buying again!  I told them to buy last year at $0.60 US but they didn’t.
107 2018-12-11 23:00:29 @realDonaldTrump my retirement stocks down 4% for year. Tariffs and uncertainty to blame. You’re no Midas
108 2018-12-11 23:00:28 That's a thing. We know for a fact that stocks will always be there, unless the world comes to an end. Holding an index of all stocks is bound to be profitable in the long run. Bitcoin on the other hand may still unfortunately fail.
109 2018-12-11 23:00:21 That’s confusing !!
Mkts reflect longs liquidating  in stocks with largest long positions individual Stks are down 20-50% and indexes only 10-12 that wil change dramatically   sell the big longs first and then everything that will show real capitulation !!
110 2018-12-11 22:59:02 Rules should be adapted to different asset classes. It is not the same investing in stocks than investing in crypto, an asset class that regularly crashes 80%-99% (3 times in 7 years!).

122 2018-12-11 22:54:06 Right.  This is reality, idiot.
Overall, stocks are down 1.5 percent this year after hitting heights in early October. Hedge funds are having their worst year since the 2008 crisis. And household debt recently hit another record high of $13.5 trillion — up $837 billion.
123 2018-12-11 22:52:20 It's not really confirmation, but a filter, i.e. activating a strategy only when conditions A & B are met. Wouldn't do that with stocks, would with crypto. Re maximizing returns, can do the math using the 50DMA/200DMA rule. Need a rule as well for not buying when mooning.

148 2018-12-11 22:38:11 Ya, I think it's more than managing your own portfolio vs the passive ETF route. It's highly unlikely that individual stocks, especially if you stay in the large cap world, are going to outperform the market by 3%, 4%, or more annual as per the mid/small premium, historically.

176 2018-12-11 22:21:40 Stocks are falling because the companies are using all the money they got in tax breaks to buy back their own stocks. That's why 1 day it's up and then the next couple it drops.

186 2018-12-11 22:17:29 the 50/200MA I personally find not that useful. I watch the bullish percentage action vs the price action. As more and more charts turn negative within an index, investors will pile into fewer and fewer stocks, which give the illusion that everything is fine price wise.

253 2018-12-11 21:45:16 Fury won the fight. Dodgy judge on 1 card specifically. Ref did well to let it go as most would’ve waved it. Both fighters’ stocks have risen.

AJ needs to make a move next or his stock declines...? #taleofthetape broke this down well. I don’t think there’s much more to add...
254 2018-12-11 21:43:09 My ideal #royalvarietyperformance #TheresaMay in some UN approved razor wired stocks being pelted with rotten veg by the most angry but diverse audience (just to keep things PC) and Jamie Oliver coming on shouting "STOP" as he could make a great ratatouille out of the excess

256 2018-12-11 21:41:34 They won't let me type enough to tell you all that 

But I don't come from money or never had anything handed to me, had to learn about budgeting/finances, stocks, real estate, etc all on my own
257 2018-12-11 21:40:49 Isnt that awful whats wrong with this crappy world?people that would do that should be publicly flogged,in fact I think I would bring back the stocks and let them suffer natural justice,I am speechless!!
258 2018-12-11 21:40:38 We are well and truly foooked  ...only the left or the rich don't give a damm about our already non existent  housing stocks etc ...how the hell can we house migrants when we have our own on  the streets living rough ?

260 2018-12-11 21:40:31 yeah just let me get out my uh, magical frame counter. This'll be hysterical to try to pull off inbetween stocks though. When I'm bored of uptaunt/sidetaunt spam.

265 2018-12-11 21:38:21 I don't know what's worse, that he is implicitly recommending his own stock and or that despite working at a bank covering bank stocks, he's still going to get it wrong.
266 2018-12-11 21:37:39 Thats a big draw. Big day for oil stocks tomorrow then.
267 2018-12-11 21:37:05 @bailey_kemp3 Nate said you trade stocks. Your profile says forex. Are you familiar with both markets? I know they are very similar.
268 2018-12-11 21:36:38 The thing is...he is prob right but nobody knows for sure and this reaction is overdone. Doesn’t mean it can’t go further. Everyone knows it is liquidity drive. So they sell first...some stocks are silly cheap
269 2018-12-11 21:36:08 A lot of people seem to be mad at someone else for their own decisions. Stocks don’t always go up. Sometimes you have to own up to your own decisions and move on.  If Affinor goes down, my money lost is on me; nobody else.
270 2018-12-11 21:35:01 Then let him shut  down the damn government as its not working for the American people anyway, stocks falling, housing going bust, farmers commiting suicide and this is what he's worried about. Wont even go visit our troops abroad  who are keeping us safe.  Dem must stand firm
271 2018-12-11 21:34:58 The down trend is getting close to taking a breath. Not sure how long the next up trend will last, but it is coming shortly. Waiting for the next up trend. #stocks

281 2018-12-11 21:31:01 Border crossings were at a 40 year low under Obama. He & Dems inherited an economy that crashed & burned under GOP. Obama turned that around. Stocks were up 250% under Obama. Unemployment down. Healthcare for 25,000,000 more Americans. That’s security. Muslim Bro stuff was fake.

283 2018-12-11 21:29:35 Fantastic day with several entries and exits on a handful of stocks. Setups look great for tomorrow as well... #farmbill2018 and the @aphriainc announcement should provide for some fireworks to take advantage of.  #youplaytowinthegame #blessed

286 2018-12-11 21:27:36 Yes, I understood you and I agreed. At the same time imho we are getting too accustomed to see the Nasdaq stocks trading side by side in this time of algos and we forget that when the story of single stock is very different, it should break ties with its index for a while. $TWTR
287 2018-12-11 21:27:23 #Stocks fell to their lows of the day around noon in the #Dow after a contentious fight between Trump and Democratic leadership over border security. Trump threatened to shut down the government if more money was not allocated towards building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

289 2018-12-11 21:26:56 @TeamCavuto Hey fat boy, stocks been volatile for months. Quit blaming it on government shut down!
290 2018-12-11 21:26:26 Thank you for answering my pondering question of the last few weeks. I thought about investing beyond the IRAs and mutual funds I have, and began researching stocks. (tucks money back under the mattress)
291 2018-12-11 21:24:58 More than 5% price rise in most $MJ stocks today proves that $SPX & $MJ are not 100% correlated assets.
292 2018-12-11 21:23:08 Patience stocks are running low.. 

servers live 4 hours 25 mins ago, managed to get in game for a total of 15 mins at most, with the longest connection about 3 mins, but average just over a minute before disconnected at first server check
293 2018-12-11 21:22:34 The church has billions & billions of dollars locked up in profit-bearing assets like stocks. Then hundreds of millions (if not billions. I don't know the cost of a temple) of dollars are spent on temples. Then millions of man hours each year are employed to serving the dead.
294 2018-12-11 21:19:43 Actually if you paid attention dopey you’d see it roared back yesterday and is continuing to increase as things settle down.. I’m curious as to why you would find falling stocks and those loosing money funny? It seems you hope the country fails. Sad really. Why hide?? Coward...

297 2018-12-11 21:18:40 Probability is market as whole goes up after time, not nesscerialy individual stocks. That'd just make it more fucked of a system
298 2018-12-11 21:18:16 Probando online de ultimate con desconocidos, tratando de jugar en equipo desde hace un buen rato y nada. Ya había escuchado quejas sobre esto, pero eso que te pongan a jugar contra tres, con lag, stocks y además gente campera no es muy agradable.
299 2018-12-11 21:18:06 As well as millions/billions of people around the world owning it as well. The people that own it have more of an incentive to keep it alive than the people that don’t own it and want to destroy it. The people that don’t own it keep most of their wealth in stocks/RE anyways.
300 2018-12-11 21:16:45 they cant raise interest rates Our stock market is a false market propped up by super 1 trillion dollars raising the price of all stocks... if we put interest rates up return on savings goes up killing stock market ... oh the webs we weave
301 2018-12-11 21:15:51 Also, due to the nature of stock matches/how tournaments are run, Smash 4 having exclusively being played with 2 stocks always bothered the hell out of me, because being one stock behind was an enormous disadvantage. Ultimate is way faster tho so 3 or 4 stocks are to be expected
302 2018-12-11 21:15:36 I just purchased my first stocks ever and it’s with  @Aurora_MMJ & @Twitter .. exciting! 
303 2018-12-11 21:15:03 World stocks ex US generally higher: Europe +1.5%; US -.04%. Another volatile day in US ending flat. Investors still looking at this as Trump's market, buying & selling on the noise of his statements. Better to focus on long-term US economy strengths & ride-out current volatility

305 2018-12-11 21:13:24 "What's my motivation?" the bulls ask. Stocks slide for most of day, rally a bit in afternoon, then sink again at the close.

Dow ends -53, -0.2% to 24,370.
S&P -0.04%, Nasdaq +0.2%.

Losers outnumbers winners 16/13 on NYSE and Nasdaq.

308 2018-12-11 21:12:16 Last I checked, stocks have moved much lower since Democrats took control of House. Coincidence? No.
309 2018-12-11 21:10:20 You have SUTCH influence!!  Now, where are those stocks...?
310 2018-12-11 21:10:00 #Stocks end the day relatively flat after a pretty positive opening. I believe we are still in a rather wide range of 2500-3000. Being closer to my low end of the range I remain bullish but this will not be an easy period for bulls or bears. Volatility will continue into 2019
311 2018-12-11 21:09:12 Stocks end flat to end choppy session
312 2018-12-11 21:08:45 Wall Street Instant Update; #Stocks end mixed in a back and forth session, the Dow at its high up better than 350 points finished down 53 at 24,370, Nasdaq Comp. +11 at 7031, the S&P 500 down fractionally
313 2018-12-11 21:08:12 Sell the news happens when the chart is overextended, look up MJ stocks 2014 January. The first day Colorado legalized the sector went berzerk for months

320 2018-12-11 21:04:55 Ok, believe whatever you want. I've been short $NVDA since $250 few months ago. Crypto collapse wasn't in the price bc mgmt was lying. I think how bad 2019 earnings will be isn't in the price either. The market is inefficient, esp in stocks heavily held by retail investors.
321 2018-12-11 21:04:34 Dear Ultimate people,
since normal matches have 3 stocks here, it's a JV4 if you don't receive any percent, not a JV3.

Sincerely,
Me.
322 2018-12-11 21:04:27 That is great. I ask a question you insult me. Good job. The rich have power to manipulate the stocks so all poor people that invest are at the whim of the rich. It is a pay to play system that responds to big money. So little money doesn't matter. My take.
323 2018-12-11 21:03:47 So many promising sites turn to stone at the corporate touch. MySpace & Tomatoes with Murdoch, HuffPost & Engadget with Verizon, Goodreads with Amazon. Money thinks creativity & enthusiasm can be bought & sold like stocks.

346 2018-12-11 20:52:16 Stocks seesaw in today's trading. The Dow was just up 150 points minutes ago, now +23 as low volumes lead to big swings.
347 2018-12-11 20:52:15 Maybe bank stocks, generally have bullshit numbers and there are thousands of non-bank stocks w/out unexploded black boxes buried all over the balance sheets. Spitballing.

361 2018-12-11 20:45:58 So much theorizing on the abiding weakness in big bank stocks. Sure, throw flat yield curve, Brexit, corporate-credit worry, soft housing into the mix.
But might not be more complicated than "We maybe saw peak cycle profitability and it looks like 8-10% ROE. Why pay up for that?"
362 2018-12-11 20:45:11 Two 30%+ pumps today and a few smaller ones inlcuding $LQMT +30% on an add from a guy who still has a positon from twice these levels. Think about that before you chase. Also, pumped $MYOS this afternoon for 10% but now it's selling along with him. #PumpAndDump #Pyramids #Stocks
363 2018-12-11 20:44:56 The Dow is just futzing around 25k. That’s what I tell people. Yeah, it was a 750 point move. That’s 3%. Volatile but not outside the bounds of testing support. Which is strong here. Lots of good stocks making new highs and forming solids bases. $AIG not being one of them

519 2018-12-11 19:27:29 #Stocks,#Indexes In view of the collapse of the rally in line with bottom signal-based expectation, best bet now is to await next bottom signal.  The rally may attempt to restart, but the nebulous top signal pattern may have been the signal of its end.
520 2018-12-11 19:27:22 Agreed on one part, except the cannabis market stocks also include the growing dispensary/retail chains and beverages/edibles market is yet to fully realized. On straight up cannabis flower, the margins and market favor the medical emphasis in my view as well.

527 2018-12-11 19:22:40 Your point is still moot. All new schools and hospitals in Canada, just like in America, are built on public funds by private contracting firms. Marxism would be if the contracting firms were also publicly owned. You silly goose. #cdnpoli

529 2018-12-11 19:21:43 Good news: Still seeing a bunch of growth stocks well above their November (and often October lows), much better than the major indexes. But you still have to wait for the market to get going -- good stocks can go bad in a hurry in bad markets. Patience is a virtue.

546 2018-12-11 19:13:21 My take is different.  If the market is selling off, I think these stocks are going to sell-off too.  But if not, my take is we may not see a sell the news event b/c #potstocks are still in accumulation ranges--you usually sell the news after an advance (after accumulation).

2. What's your take on stocks and equities, is it advisable for long term investments.

This number looks even worse when you exclude 0% movers, consolidations and other distortions. What a complete nightmare this market has been.

620 2018-12-11 18:49:21 Wrong again. Most Schools in the USA are public schools, and each of these is built entirely on govt funding.

649 2018-12-11 18:38:19 UTILITY STOCKS:  Utility stocks are at multi-year highs, up 7% this year.  The stocks are seen as a "risk-off" sector, strong when investors are concerned about stocks.  In addition, these stocks do well when interest rates decline.  Talk is fed will hold on interest rate bumps
650 2018-12-11 18:36:50 I see all these stocks breaking down with many near 50% off their highs, and you want to buy into a market that was this bloated?

664 2018-12-11 18:26:03 INDUSTRIAL & MATERIAL STOCKS are down 10% and 14% respectively.  Slowing world economies coupled with the lack of money in the USA for infrastructure projects bodes poorly for these stocks.  I'm avoiding them.

667 2018-12-11 18:23:48 @jimcramer I hope your show focuses on stocks, not politics. I can't watch @cnbc any more. The addiction to fear mongering is disheartening and doesn't represent the good that is happening
668 2018-12-11 18:23:11 Youre just another of the establishment’s suckers if you believe that. The rich were fine before & after (& thier healthcare stocks went up in value enormously). The people suffering are the lower 90%, not the top 10%. 30 million still have nothing, & medical bankrupcies continue

676 2018-12-11 18:20:18 Didn't the historic high p/e ratio of 2008 get there by the economy falling a cliff?  If that happens again we could go to that historically high p/e with stocks trading at their same share price?
677 2018-12-11 18:19:35 Most Hospitals in the USA are either old ones established originally by churches, not enterprise, not unlike in Canada, or newer ones established under immense subsidization from local, state, and federal funding. What you might call corporate welfare. #polcan

687 2018-12-11 18:17:29 False. Schools in America are funded primarily by local property taxes and credits for pvt schools, which is why there is such immense divide in quality. Canadian schools have a more level playing field across a prov thanks to federal transfer funding playing a role. #cdnpoli

690 2018-12-11 18:16:37 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to treat your carpal tunnel syndrome
691 2018-12-11 18:16:14 Keep in mind this is still based on US exports of 1.9bb. By my calculation, with exports through Nov 29, demand would projection to only 1.186 bb. Roughly another 715mb added to ending stocks figure calculated at 955 mb. 
Theoretically that comes to about 1.670bb. 
Oh what fun...

756 2018-12-11 17:52:41 USDA increases global soy ending stocks to 115.33 mmt. That's a negative number. Up from 112.1 mmt last month. African swine fever and lower Chinese demand go blame, analysts say.
757 2018-12-11 17:51:47 PAST MARKET CRASH of 50%.  On 10/1/07, the Dow was trading at almost   $14,000...16 months later it had declined 50% to $7,000.   It took 5 1/2   years before the stocks market again reached $14,000 in early 2013.     So the "buy and hold" strategy isn't always the best strategy.

791 2018-12-11 17:35:38 I'm already seeing individual stocks take out their lows from yesterday's big reversal. The fact that all of these bounces can't last an entire day let alone a week is very negative $$PY $QQQ
792 2018-12-11 17:35:24 Momentum and high beta tech stocks have been huge outperformers over the last 5 years. So we should prepare for and conclude that they will just do more of the same for the next 5.

817 2018-12-11 17:28:22 Most of the control (through ownership of stocks) is by big institutional investors or people coming from wealthy families. 

What you're saying is great ideally but not practical because people don't care, are too lazy, and whatnot. Hard to get people on hard behind one issue

829 2018-12-11 17:25:20 @SquawkAlley should we sell our FANG stocks since there is no agreement among Executive and Legislative branches about building the border wall?
830 2018-12-11 17:25:11 Absolutely. Same happened with the .com era... "Crazy if you buy their stocks"... And computers "why would anyone need a computer?".

837 2018-12-11 17:22:08 Hey, was buying stocks this morning a good idea?
838 2018-12-11 17:22:02 Here is a question everyone should ponder: when the next crisis becomes clearly visible and I decide that the time has come to sell down my stocks and bonds, to whom would I be selling and at what price?
839 2018-12-11 17:21:57 Anyone who bought stocks solely because the president tweeted something deserves what he gets.
840 2018-12-11 17:21:55 Simple concept, if you build a warehouse to build widgets and create employment, that should have a tax incentive

 If your investing in stocks, that does not directly create jobs. Hence profits should be taxed

The exception, IRA that can't be a loophole. For ma & pa, not Romney

860 2018-12-11 17:16:34 Stocks were moving higher so dt had to do something to stop the rally. Luckily he was able to threaten a gov’t shutdown if he can’t get $ for his asinine useless waste of a wall to prevent women & children from entering this former great country. What a total prick!
861 2018-12-11 17:15:49 I'm not so worried about the stock market since only a small percentage of Americans have stocks. I'm much more worried about the impending recession because we have no arrows left in our quiver to shoot at it. A recession will affect many many more.

877 2018-12-11 17:10:15 Various ETFs  "short" the stock market..i.e. you make money when stocks decline in value. Proshares ETFs include:
Short Dow  - symbol DOG
Short S&P  - symbol SH
Short Nasdaq - symbol PSQ
Talk to your financial advisor to see if shorting the market makes sense for you.

I’m not familiar with the company, so I can’t comment too much beyond that. All weed stocks are hugely discounted compared to 52-wk high right now tho.

897 2018-12-11 17:04:01 thx,  daily looks great, i guess i'm just not used to these thinly traded stocks.
898 2018-12-11 17:03:43 I agree. And I'm starting to think that stocks and crypto are more attached than we'd like to accept too, If we're heading into a stock bear market, crypto will remain right there with it. I don't think people see crypto as a safe store of value - I know I don't.

1011 2018-12-11 16:23:43 Try this for your investment allocation. 100 - Age = Percentage of Stock exposure in your portfolio. For example: 100 - 60 = 40% Stocks then the difference would be 60% Bonds.

1019 2018-12-11 16:20:31 Thanks, this help. I learned from your momentum master that for those stocks which has best RS but no fundamental ones, u named them as price leader, which by textbook definition leader. So when u say tighten my criteria, do u mean more on the setups itself or criteria on eps
1020 2018-12-11 16:19:58 Im flat in my stocks portfolio, but in the small discretionary one, I just like seeing if I can trade it around.  Keeps me active. Agree with you, its an ugly thing to do, to short in size around these levels.

1023 2018-12-11 16:17:35 Life insurance, stocks, investments are things we as a community haven’t used to our advantage. We haven’t passed down money because we weren’t taught to think like that. We have to use the same tools the white folks have to our advantage. Even if it’s a sacrifice to do so.
1024 2018-12-11 16:17:25 This doesn’t include the millionaires, who qualify for subsidies based on their tax return-bank accounts, assets, homes,stocks, not considered-
1025 2018-12-11 16:17:20 True. But to be fair, market itself is “shallow”. Few listed firms worth analysis, no market beyond stocks, companies don’t disclose enough, the economy itself is hard to predict. And also, besides, this goes for many other industries; brain drain has affected every sector.

1035 2018-12-11 16:13:35 I don't understand the 'cash is a position' comments.  Is there someone saying you have to own stocks?
1036 2018-12-11 16:13:08 Would beg to differ, Utsav. Except the 3rd point, all other points are no way going to help a company or industry grow. Only if company grows, stocks will boom automatically.
1037 2018-12-11 16:13:03 It just goes to show you how overvalued stocks were in 1999.

If stocks weren't so overvalued now, bonds would have blew them away over the last 20 years.
1038 2018-12-11 16:12:37 @amberkanwar "...maybe stocks would trade on....oh, I don't know...(*shrug) fundamentals?"  I laughed until coffee came out my nose! Another great morning show!

1040 2018-12-11 16:12:20 I'd say it's about 50% stocks like AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, BA etc

And 50% ETFs like IWM, TZA, SPY, TQQQ, QQQ, etc

PLEASE find out who has stocks in Google, Facebook, Twitter.
Everyone seems to go TOO easy on them.
WHO owns stocks, and has offshore accounts.
1120 2018-12-11 15:45:46 Giving individual investors access to diversified equity exposure is just a feeble attempt by "The Man" to distract the masses. Instead, people should own a couple of stocks that outperform the market.
1121 2018-12-11 15:45:11 $IMMY one of the best trending stocks for the price it seems. Nice move today 
1122 2018-12-11 15:45:07 Just like Fiat Currency (USD et al)  a LOT of inflated stocks. The markets are a Ponzi, and the retail investor is chum for sharks.

1336 2018-12-11 14:41:56 it's what happens when investors look at earnings as a single means to value a stock, and when executives are comped on short term performance.  on top of this, the market prices for these stocks are 5-10x their actual equity values (book values), and that's including intangibles

1340 2018-12-11 14:41:09 Sir u havent shared how u pick ur stocks for this strategy ?
1341 2018-12-11 14:40:54 Well most stocks are at least.
1342 2018-12-11 14:40:35 $ears when playing small, cash burning stocks, one should always expect the worst of behavior until proven otherwise.
1343 2018-12-11 14:40:12 Seem’s like it’s a traders market and that fear is a heavy factor. Prices seems superficially surpressed to me in regards of fundamentals. Both stocks and crypto.
1344 2018-12-11 14:39:57 He’s the largest shareholder of the company, so the chairman literally has no power over anything. Also, I’m pretty sure his tweets only have to be reviewed if they have the potential to affect the companies stocks/value.
1345 2018-12-11 14:39:43 seems you're getting your info from FOX (FAKE NEWS ... EMEMY OF THE PEOPLE NEWS!!!) But from what i see on REAL news the economy doesn't seem to be doing well ... stocks down ... smh

1408 2018-12-11 14:29:12 Tip of the Week - yesterday I studied what I call a major method to finding pre move stocks for buying or selling short. Insider Trading I watch Hedge Funds primary and secondary along with Pension Funds. They HAVE to profit or lose business or MONEY. Big money can move a stock.
1409 2018-12-11 14:29:09 It’s mainly symbolic. Millenials in the US don’t buy stocks individually. They just buy into an ETF.
1410 2018-12-11 14:28:58 Yaya Hilary, this one is hard. Someone that will be asking how much she borrowed from me? She actually asked twice. First time, I had cash. Second time, I had to liquidate stocks to help. I was warned not to, but my heart was weak & I was travelling, didn't need Naira at the time

1431 2018-12-11 14:19:35 Spring’s small selloff and the autumn rout have left investors sour, more wary and far more selective. That will be reflected in how many sectors outperform the market and by how much, as well as how many stocks outperform the sector, and by how much

1433 2018-12-11 14:18:48 How do I Profit? - I seize opportunity in two ways, growth and value, and stocks unfairly hard hit during corrections. A third way is new companies doing well yet undiscovered. Today for me it’s Biotech and a couple other sectors like tech, AI, Blockchain, Internet of Things.

1441 2018-12-11 14:16:00 Actually they are not. Hovering near yearly low, but not all time lows. They are still well above 2016 levels.  Now is a great time to accumulate both stocks and crypto, but no need to spread FUD about the economy.   The media does enough of that for everyone.

1474 2018-12-11 14:03:34 Indeed, but we all enjoy the party when policy dangles cheap rates and easy money to buy buy buy. Greed on individual level has gone euphorically along post 2008 re housing, stocks, and all consumer consumption
1475 2018-12-11 14:03:02 Seeing a lot of companies currently declining in the stock market taking a massive amount of money to buyback stocks.. for companies like NOC, a lot of soon-to-be retirees losing tons of cash

Find a couple stocks with good volume and learn how they trade, stick to trading those stocks add a new one every now and then, if one stops working.

1540 2018-12-11 13:31:12 Not true. Stocks are down because the market corrects itself. When you artificially inflate it by giving corporations $1tr in tax giveaways, you have to realize that is going to be temporary, and will go back down again.

1682 2018-12-11 12:05:06 Many "hot" stocks in that list, so maybe so. But I would not underestimate  institutional component to the selling either.
1683 2018-12-11 12:03:44 @BBCRadio2 @theJeremyVine  when is @theresa_may going to stop her destruction of this country's economy and reputation. A remainer should not have been in charge of #Brexit. The City Boys  will make a killing with the down and ups of stocks/shares, currency and the public suffer.
1684 2018-12-11 12:03:32 If you like smaller stocks with recovery prospects take a look at Driver, which has doubled profits and restored dividend. Shares have already staged a recovery but still down on 5 years ago. Bumping up against a tough ceiling but could break through.

1720 2018-12-11 11:43:19 That's interesting, but I'm not referring to the general markets, specifically the crypto sector. 

The reduced correlation of crypto relative to stocks is usually a catalyst for a new wave of inflows (funds like to buy uncorrelated assets, but especially when trending up).

1726 2018-12-11 11:37:42 Many people believe that it takes money to make money. This is not true. Always remember that if you can lose money investing in gold, you can lose money in anything. Ultimately, it is not gold, stocks, real estate, hard work, or money that makes you rich—it is ur financial IQ.
1727 2018-12-11 11:37:40 Good, going all in on Bitcoin is still too risky. You should hedge with physical gold, maybe real estate & stocks in some low risk country. Of course zero shitcoins (they are just, low liquidity, leveraged Bitcoin derivatives w/ more risk & scammy noise on top).

But the high interest to #cryptocurrencies from millennials is not because they are young and reckless, but because they see a long-term potential. It is like investing in stocks in 1970-80

2011 2018-12-11 07:16:56 Best part about day trading options? I don't care where the market ends up next year, I'll make money every day just playing a couple stocks in the direction they're already moving, whichever direction it be.
2012 2018-12-11 07:16:36 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to improve your phantom limb syndrome
2013 2018-12-11 07:14:52 ICOs are penny stocks, tiny companies selling shares, 99.99% will amount to nothing, BTC on the other hand never claimed to have any intrinsic value, cryptocurrencies and ICOs are worlds apart. Soon main stream companies will be tokenized and IPOs will be in the blockchain.

South African markets closed in the red yesterday, pulled down by broad based losses in retail and banking sector stocks. 70 stocks closed higher, 170 closed lower and 185 were unchanged. The All Share fell by 1.18% 
What to watch today
2043 2018-12-11 06:49:23 Because one can afford to be as ideological as they want as long as they have a health plan paid for by taxpayers, and up until 2012 were able to use their insider knowledge as members of Congress to trade stocks.  And it appears that some still do it.

- Bad timing: it was the start of a bear market everywhere
- MJ stocks all fell around the same time
- Tiny float, almost 3 mil short
- Missed earnings

Some to the ground

But if you manage risk
And cut those that miss
You stand a chance

@DrGPradhan
2181 2018-12-11 04:46:44 Made 9/42 for the first weekly. Not too bad. I have a lot of learning to do.
Also a common theme I noticed in all my losing sets was I'd be down to stocks and nearly make a 3 stock comeback.
2182 2018-12-11 04:45:49 Interesting to see all the major defense stocks except TXT caught bids today. Wonder what that is about?
2183 2018-12-11 04:45:15 Wings have something great going for them right now. Howard, Kronwall & Gus’s stocks are rising game by game. Holland can’t mess this up. Trade for picks and younger future red wings. Long term success, not let’s make the playoffs.

2197 2018-12-11 04:30:17 Today is the day the Indian Stock Market starts factoring the possibility of a hung 2019. No more jokes. No more memes. Its a reality. 
But quality stocks and companies will forge ahead. Life must go on. Wages need to be earned. Money to be spent. Goals to be achieved.
2198 2018-12-11 04:30:05 Nay packet mai baychain tum ko cheez wohe purani. 
Btw stocks will sustain. If the economy is in low key interest rate and out of the deficits.  But here in Pakistan just a visit of khan to Karachi will give us a positive change of 738 points. Amazing & manipulated.
2199 2018-12-11 04:28:30 Your comparison to crypto isn't the same. BTC is still 339,000% higher than it's peak in 2010, which was a huge annual increase from its inception. SP500 only has 230% increase in ten years? There's a reason why people HODL crypto. It moves like lightning, stocks move like mud
2200 2018-12-11 04:27:32 I could see the world dropping their stocks for commodities before crypto easily. I'd love for it to be crypto firs though haha. Make it a safe haven.

2222 2018-12-11 04:12:27 I will never step into another Dicks Store again. First because their crap is overpriced and second because of their gun policy.  There are plenty other places that compete with them with better prices and aren’t anti-gun/2A. I pity investors in their stocks.

2226 2018-12-11 04:09:19 Agreed...if they hodl for 90 years and tried to ride it up to today then most likely their company stocks would have probably folded by now unless they bought coke or bayer...even so with inflation they probably could only afford 2 shares lmao.

2263 2018-12-11 03:45:37 Judging by the free fall in stocks over the past few weeks, it appears the companies that received the bulk of the tax break are tired of pumping their stock prices through buybacks. it looks like we’re about to find out where we’re at without the benefit of the tax “payout”.

2283 2018-12-11 03:34:27 I use stops as I place a trade. I avoid getting caught up in emotional decision making. I do not buy stocks below 200 sma.  My stops are placed 10% below entries, 8% average. If stopped then I am out on to the next trade. 0.5 to 1% max risk per trade. No massive positions.

2304 2018-12-11 03:22:49 Buying back stocks is a different topic than what we had been discussing. However, buy backs increase stockholder values and revenues because there are fewer stocks to share profits with. That generates revenues.
2305 2018-12-11 03:22:26 Thought you were saying 30% stocks my bad
2306 2018-12-11 03:21:16 Very interesting idea I own the same ETF. Before seeing your tweet I had never thought about selling it to invest in US stocks. I might think about it as well.

2362 2018-12-11 02:47:21 However PC & Gandhis took advantages of his PC's FM post in every possible manner he could. Big stocks & securities scam will be busted if investigated seriously. Over 10 yrs UPA manipulated stock mkts to gain billions of rupees.

2364 2018-12-11 02:45:22 Yes correct, keep in mind the market has been going great guns the last couple years. Will I remain that way ? I promise you then undervalued stocks will be coming down much further.. and the people who don’t have the nerve and cash to hold, they will loose a stack on good stocks
2365 2018-12-11 02:44:08 Okay to break it down easily. Tumblr and Facebook both were investigated for illegal sex trafficking and distribution of child pornography. One banned 18+ content and it backfired due to a faulty algorithm. Thus their own boots attacked them. Their stocks plummeted for the new-

2384 2018-12-11 02:33:38 Just watch, this move raises stock prices, then one side will blow up the agreement (likely Trump), causing those stocks to then tank again.

I'd like a nice desk top to bad I don't have space
2386 2018-12-11 02:32:38 Again, it's just domain holders and web devs being lazy. And their stocks suffered for it. Tumblr's stock symbol and price are completely unavailable. And serves them right. They are hurdling down the path of bankruptcy and their own complacency is to blame

2411 2018-12-11 02:12:14 The value is not the same as price. The value of the company is its intrinsic value regardless of the market sentiment or turbulence. Buy undervalued stocks and be patient as price will eventually catch up with intrinsic value of the company over time.

2433 2018-12-11 01:55:56 Mainly just do the research. Play the long game and don't panic about dips. I have some stocks I'm taking a chance on and some I know are safe and will slowly climb over the next 10+ years
2434 2018-12-11 01:55:40 You know whats also not cool about Smash online? You'll set your stocks to 3, and every 1 out of 10 games it just starts you with 2 while the other guy has 3 for absolutely no reason.
2435 2018-12-11 01:53:54 Hell, we don't know that. It's all like buying stocks. Some guys you see and talk to for 30 seconds (Hudson) and you just know. Others, trying to predict what they'll be like in 3 or 4 years is a total crapshoot.
2436 2018-12-11 01:53:48 I feel like I should be putting savings into stocks bc that’s an adult thing to do right?? but am I that much of an adult?? how do you become adult enough to understand stocks idk man
2437 2018-12-11 01:53:33 Benchmarks in Japan and South Korea fell, while stocks in Australia were little changed near a two-year low.
2438 2018-12-11 01:53:25 Asian stocks extended this week’s declines as investors shrugged off a U.S. rebound, with investors loath to “buy the dip” amid a panoply of concerns about the global outlook.

2440 2018-12-11 01:52:15 That percentage can significantly increase if you invest in the shares niche/industry you're are aware of and know every know how or market and are updated with the news.
Stocks are not that difficult, people treat it as Gamble hence lose mostly

2456 2018-12-11 01:39:13 What feels bullish now for Eurodollars is that stocks came up WAY off their lows, and Eurodollars did not break a commensurate amount.  That’s my read on the short term pressure.

2462 2018-12-11 01:38:44 Stock split used be very common of the fast growing companies.  I believe it was Warren Buffet who REALLY hated the idea and it then becomes less popular.  And yes, I think #tsla should split. WB hated it so much that he created a different class of stocks BRK-B instead of split.
2463 2018-12-11 01:38:42 3 out of every 4 people who try to trade stocks, will lose their money.

Only 25% actually ever make money. 

Conclusion: If you don’t know what you’re doing, don’t trade stocks.

2471 2018-12-11 01:32:26 There are also enormous reserves off the California and Florida coasts, but environmentalism... Bottom line, imo too many ppl think politics controls the market when it really doesn’t. Stocks tend to respond to trends, trade and market fluidity.

I heard about a guy who lost $120k from his requirement because his broker-managed assets did not have any sort of stop loss in place. Just sad.

And right now, stocks are going down. Not up.

2492 2018-12-11 01:19:40 It is not a good time right now to invest in stocks. The stock market is crumbling and people are losing a lot of money in stocks. It is better to learn how to trade in the forex market. There is a free intro to forex webinar u should attend. I will like to link you to it

2498 2018-12-11 01:14:06 50% of the population owns no Stocks - including IRA/Roth/401K.
2499 2018-12-11 01:14:03 Agreed. Not only are they both monumental liars, their lack of conscience is breathtaking. They appear to have forgotten who they work for - we the People.  They really make me nostalgic for the days of stocks & pillories; public humiliation and whipping posts sound good too.
2500 2018-12-11 01:13:36 RETAIL STOCKS have been getting hammered recently.  The group is down 4% for the year after falling 11% in the last six months.  The sector is very oversold and may bounce.  But I'm avoiding all retail stocks because of economic uncertainty.
2501 2018-12-11 01:13:34 That's perfectly said.Believe me even highly educated Indians enter Stocks/MF with tendency of earning in multiples of Bank Interest rates within a years time education is must for such ppl
2502 2018-12-11 01:13:24 "Savings are unspent tax credits" Mosler. Does that sound like Money flowing? No. The only place that money flows once in profit/savings is asset speculation.

2505 2018-12-11 01:10:45 CONSUMER STAPLES STOCKS are down 4% for year, but higher by about 7% in the last six months as investors move away from riskier stocks.  While I'm generally avoiding stocks until there is better indication of the economy's future, this sector may be a lot less risky than others

2509 2018-12-11 01:04:51 Long ago I spent a lot of time trading penny stocks & when a big co like $AMZN or $AAPL has a huge run (up like heck or down to hell) I'll still have a moment where I'm waiting for a T-12 or a volatility halt 
2510 2018-12-11 01:03:23 Time to bring back the village stocks.
2511 2018-12-11 01:02:08 For stocks about 2k spread around small companies that I believe will one day be worth something, it’s a slow grind. No point in investing in large companies that are already doing well unless you got a lot of capital to put in initially

2515 2018-12-11 00:58:55 Substantial amount but I let my stocks sit, even more on crypto... and forex in itself paid all my bills at one point
2516 2018-12-11 00:58:46 This is a dumb statement. Either you are in stocks or cryptos or any market, if you lose over 70% of your money, get out.
2517 2018-12-11 00:57:07 @potcargo when will the stocks be replenished? 
2518 2018-12-11 00:55:17 I would say you should be required to risk-adjust the returns.  

+85% would be a great decade for stocks, especially coming from peak-cycle levels... +85% in XBT only retraces the move to *October 31*.
2519 2018-12-11 00:52:27 I was up 2 stocks to 1 and then SD'd at 0. Last stock each, dudes at 130 and I'm at 70ish and died to a counter to lose the set.

2520 2018-12-11 00:52:15 Lucario can shoot (Max) Aura Spheres for Incineroar to Revenge. If the Anubis strat works too they’re going to take stocks under 50% free.
2521 2018-12-11 00:51:56 I don't recall there being an outrage to the permanent dropping of David Hookes in mid 80s (when stocks were also low) once found out to be not up to test level. 

Funnily enough, on the occasions we saw it, his cover drive was also exquisite.
2522 2018-12-11 00:51:42 @jimcramer: a lot of these 'cloud' stocks look good ($RNG, $OKTA, $VMW, $NOW). Even $BOX ... looks like it's bottomed out and building a base (want to see Px break above this little base before buying). You can put $HDP, $CLDR in the same camp as $BOX.
2523 2018-12-11 00:50:45 Ok serious question how much money have you made off stocks
2524 2018-12-11 00:50:31 Oh, there are people who seek gun confiscation and they're actively doing it in some states. Heck, Trump just ordered confiscation of bump stocks and the @NRA is orange nosing him to the point they need to get a room.

2528 2018-12-11 00:48:40 @cz_binance The 80M coins in circulation have seen an 6000% increase November and December 2018. They are shorting BTC to it's death. It's called naked shorting. The SEC regulates it on stocks. But with BTC unregulated by the SEC we get what we pay for.
2529 2018-12-11 00:48:27 Cumulatively Dick's brand, stocks, and sales are up. They're killing it in the Sporting Goods. Again, this didn't hurt them.

They anticipated, reacted, and marketed accordingly, and low and behold, they may have to re-brand to less/no hunting gear. They don't regret their choice

2537 2018-12-11 00:44:50 I love joe budden and all i do lately is read about stocks.
2538 2018-12-11 00:44:12 Stocks that have been up over the past two years predicted to be up, stock down over the last two years predicted to be down.  More at 11.
2539 2018-12-11 00:42:49 Yes...I tested more than 200 failed double bottom charts and conclusion is same..In all the stocks volatility was increasing.
2540 2018-12-11 00:40:40 Making money from stocks look deceptively easy. The reality is that stock market is one of the toughest mental games in the world.

2542 2018-12-11 00:38:54 Question: How are leveraged and inverse ETF options priced @CBOE? It's unreal that the theta on a legeraged, inverse option, especially with expiration long in future, have a higher theta than volatile stocks. I don't think you can price them accurately to be honest.
2543 2018-12-11 00:38:35 Basically teaching you stocks, how to move currency’s. Forex stands for the foreign exchange market.
2544 2018-12-11 00:37:23 Yup (as long as it's legal), and Dick's cumulative stocks and sales are up. Good business decision. Good moral decision.

They will no longer be complicit in the dangers of this particular weapon.
2545 2018-12-11 00:37:03 I use IBD/Marketsmith, and just wondering how much weight you give to the Industry Group Rank on stocks showing relative strength?  I have alerts on TWLO & NOW, but their group is ranked 73 out of 197.  Thanks
2546 2018-12-11 00:36:47 the tech stocks are revolutionizing the way business and data are done...the banks as a sector is the huge problem for the market and will stay that way for as long as i can see
2547 2018-12-11 00:36:11 Same reason why there is multi Quadrillions in derivatives. As with stocks, bonds, commodities. They are leveraged. Don't get me started on the paper silver and gold where there is more traded in a day than is mined in a year.
2548 2018-12-11 00:32:22 People will rather buy the new iPhone for $1000 than use that same cash to buy $1000 worth of stocks... Interesting times we live in.

2554 2018-12-11 00:29:20 Holy Shit. Yes.
Dick's is closing hunting stores.
Dick's is not closing any 'Dick's Sporting Goods' stores. This was anticipated. Dicks as a whole still is outperforming last years sales and stocks by selling non-hunting related items. Doing the right thing didn't hurt them.

2557 2018-12-11 00:28:47 The action in bank stocks is troubling but harder to read the tape for insights these days given all the stupidity
2558 2018-12-11 00:28:45 Stocks, pillory, tar & feathering, hanging cage exposed to the elements, forehead tattooes denoting theif, burglay, rapist, mugger, abuser etc... the possibleb list is a long one.
2559 2018-12-11 00:28:40 Perhaps it is time to stop allowing gossip to control the markets? Shut the media down and the stocks will control themselves via facts.

2562 2018-12-11 00:23:20 But Hussainstradamus was right. All 3 did close green. What stocks do you like?
2563 2018-12-11 00:21:20 My opinion on this? Be wary. Take time to reconsider all decisions. Diversify and mitigate. Select robust opportunities.

2566 2018-12-11 00:18:55 You guys legit are underestimating the spirit of Bayo players. You think they are going to just quit that easily? 

She can be down to her last stock, 300% against ZeRo with a full 3 stocks and I’d put my money on Bayo.
2567 2018-12-11 00:18:33 Stocks are crashing, more blood. You think we will just start pumping. Everyone's suddenly need BTC.
2568 2018-12-11 00:18:13 Thank you Kevin. Social media is always this human highlight reel. I can only imagine how many people feel like failures when all you see is everybody else crushing life. Poker, streaming, stocks etc. @TJDarroch just mentioned a documentary on social media
2569 2018-12-11 00:18:04 My stocks are flying through the God damn roof, son.
2570 2018-12-11 00:16:10 Which is a hunting offshoot- owned by Dicks as opposed to being ‘Dicks Sporting Goods’.

This result was anticipated, as a hunting store, and as competent businesspeople, they compensated by selling other products- thus their stocks and sales up.
2571 2018-12-11 00:16:04 I believe if you were running the Cardinals, we’d be laughing stocks. Your strategy of overpay all the time would have us fucked. Look at the Angels, and tell me how overpaying for all these guys is a good idea

2577 2018-12-11 00:13:42 Starting to see a great deal of global risk in the financial markets. I am not liking the political and economic instability that is being witnessed all over the world.

It seems as though the markets are spinning on a knife edge.
