FYI 1 drop of oil contaminates 1 million drops of water (20 million drops if you plan to drink it). So 100 L into the ocean, unrecovered would contaminate 100 million litres of water that our food fish live in. No big deal eh patriot?

153 2018-05-31 23:44:37 It's actually easy. Take the cookie sheet out and let the oven preheat to 350°. While it's heating, put aluminum foil on the cookie sheet and lay the filet on it, skin side down. You can cook about a pound, more or less. Put about a tablespoon of olive oil on the fish ...
154 2018-05-31 23:44:29 Burning the midnight oil with another prisoner. Caffeine required! Missed out on the hat trick tonight!
155 2018-05-31 23:44:10 I'm a purist. I make white popcorn on the stove with a little corn oil...then top it with pink sea salt and melted butter.
156 2018-05-31 23:44:03 Russia is Lovin' It! They are heavily invested in oil.
157 2018-05-31 23:44:01 Canada is the biggest supplier of oil.  Canada just bought a billion dollar pipeline and is laying another for shipments to British Columbia.  You guys are gonna get squeezed out by Mexico too. Over a billion in exports/imports are going to be affected. Good luck to you all.
158 2018-05-31 23:43:59 Interesting, do you use coconut oil?
159 2018-05-31 23:43:45 I put argon oil in my hair this morning before my shower and my whole head is STILL so greasy! I can’t even be mad because at least it’s moisturizing! #greaseball
160 2018-05-31 23:43:45 Wella hair oil smells lush
161 2018-05-31 23:43:42 does this mean the oil pipeline is off or, what socks did he wear today

165 2018-05-31 23:43:13 Let's stop sending them oil (we're their largest foreign supplier of the stuff after all) and sell it to China and Mexico instead and see how he likes it. And oil just scratches the surface of natural resources we sell them...
166 2018-05-31 23:42:57 Brent is gone now come's Ivanka crude oil.
167 2018-05-31 23:42:53 But yes, we are literally going to have to make oil tanker sized ocean cleaning machines, fleets of them,and bring that crap back to land for correct processing. Not just send all our crap off to India to be sorted by hoboes with a corrupt govt.
168 2018-05-31 23:42:51 Oil is racist.
169 2018-05-31 23:42:49 OLIVE OIL PEOPLE: Tomorrow is your special day. It's National Olive Oil Day & @FIGandOLIVE_USA is offering you a treat with 50% off of all bottles of Olive Oil.

176 2018-05-31 23:42:12 What if there's no oil in South China Sea?
177 2018-05-31 23:42:01 Machines don’t get tired, they get oil changes
178 2018-05-31 23:42:01 Ive also been sayin that NASCAR should invest in gold mining and oil production in Equador...  Bastards never listen to me
179 2018-05-31 23:41:38 My father-in-law was a minister and his marrying us and as an amazing part of our wedding. Having someone who loves you perform the ceremony is a wonderful thing, in the truest sense of wonderful.
180 2018-05-31 23:41:25 I’ve been wanting a fragrance oil diffuser and today one of my kids gave me one + a candle, I’m so happy lol :’)
181 2018-05-31 23:41:15 @AbeShinzo be careful negotiating with @JustinTrudeau he promised Canadians electoral reform, to end oil subsidies and to protect indigenous rights, #Canada is worse off than it has been in a long time
182 2018-05-31 23:41:11 Yea, this is much worse. The show was in the can and everyone thought it was great. Execs, producers, on down were good.
183 2018-05-31 23:41:10 Welcome Back. Can you talk about the benefits of C-60 And is it better than CBD oil
184 2018-05-31 23:41:09 $50 just for oil for the car.... just the oil
185 2018-05-31 23:41:04 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
186 2018-05-31 23:40:53 Among the many outrages and scandals, let's not forget how Trump politicizes the resources at his disposal. 

Instead of being the president of everyone, he is president of Bil Oil, Putin, China, with a few handouts to red states tossed in for good measure. Source: Puerto Rico.
187 2018-05-31 23:40:50 something is bigly wrong if #POTUS imposed tariffs on Canada, Mexico and EU but not on Venezuelan oil or in traveling to #Cuba #mAga should we start to suspect a unseen power at work here?
188 2018-05-31 23:40:29 咎さんも猫苦手なのか…
189 2018-05-31 23:40:25 First Vincint’s car was spraying out oil last week so he fixed that and now he ran over a screw and has a flat tire..what are the odds man, just our luck 
190 2018-05-31 23:40:23 so true.  on time my ear was itchy...so i put a drop or two of olive oil in there, massaged it in my ear canal a bit, then stuck a q-tip in there.  it was at that time that i knew what sex must feel like for women.  EARGASM!!
191 2018-05-31 23:40:19 Bruh they have to filter it out the old oil as well plus fill up your other fluids  
192 2018-05-31 23:40:15 夏とかTシャツに油のシミできるよねえ。あれ透けるからほぼ全裸みたいになるよ僕。
193 2018-05-31 23:40:06 Oil is more expensive than when Obama was in office. (this doesn't really matter cause the president has no control of it) natural gas killed coal not Democrats. Manufacturing is being killed by automation yet another thing he lacks control of
194 2018-05-31 23:40:04 We really dont need it. Itll all buff out, even if it takes time. Im in favor of communities restructuring so there is less of a need for commuting, and lowering the demand for oil in general.
195 2018-05-31 23:40:02 Brazil showed signs of returning to normal today as an oil workers union ended their strike and an 11-day trucker protest wound down
196 2018-05-31 23:39:53 Arianne get yourself on the cannabis oil treatment
197 2018-05-31 23:39:47 I do too and I wish I could find it more often.
198 2018-05-31 23:39:28 Nobody talks about how Space X successfully performed an oil change on the car in deep space.
199 2018-05-31 23:39:24 Were had a oil spill  in our beaches
200 2018-05-31 23:39:21 “We are like tenant farmers chopping down the fence around our house for fuel, when we should be using Nature’s inexhaustible sources of energy -sun, wind, and tide-. I hope we don’t have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that.”

204 2018-05-31 23:39:04 @AngelaMerkeICDU friendly advice from a Canadian citizen, @JustinTrudeau said he would end oil subsidies & he just bought a pipeline, said he would protect Indigenous Rights & the Health inequity is worse than ever, swore electoral reform - it’ll never happen #WatchYourBack

208 2018-05-31 23:38:44 Am I reading that right, in December Canada imported 16% of the padd3 oil?
209 2018-05-31 23:38:32 And government-owned sand oil pipelines while crowing about his environmental record?  Trudeau is a fraud.

212 2018-05-31 23:38:15 put olive oil on it
213 2018-05-31 23:38:13 Mr. President:
It's time to impose a 35% remittance tax to all remittances going to Mexico. Remember since 2014 the first source of Mexican economy income are the U.S. remittances above oil, mining, agriculture, etc.
Impose at least a 25% import tax to all European cars.
214 2018-05-31 23:38:04 And a little oil.... but I love both!
215 2018-05-31 23:38:00 I’ll get a grip when I see Mr. Gore commenting on the coal plants being built in China and Japan, the continued “dirty” oil production in California, and the bodies being moved out of cemeteries in Germany in order to access coal at the same frequency that he calls out Canada.
216 2018-05-31 23:37:40 touched is right....
217 2018-05-31 23:37:38 It’s because he makes his living of debating weaker opponents. Doesn’t even debate properly and is quite the snake oil salesman.
218 2018-05-31 23:37:35 also destroying the ability to get and refine oil was key. ISIS was going down it was a matter of time. I do not credit Trump for this. Trump's effect on ISIS was minimal at best.
219 2018-05-31 23:37:32 It taste like oil
220 2018-05-31 23:37:25 @josie_maran Luv your products & probably have enuf body butter to swim in, but please, please, pretty please create a "sleep" line with lavender - serum for the face, argan oil & the big tub of body butter so I can get a good night's sleep! <3
221 2018-05-31 23:37:25 You need to see the video by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.  He is not happy man.  Remember we are getting oil from Canada.
222 2018-05-31 23:37:21 @JustinTrudeau why not sky rocket the price o electricity and oil/gas they buy from us to..take Trump to The cleaners!
223 2018-05-31 23:37:14 You got money you work in the oil fields 
224 2018-05-31 23:37:11 Yeahh don't do that unless they have low UVB rays or whatever it is (the more expensive kind).

15SPF tanning oil and natural sun is the only way to go imo
225 2018-05-31 23:37:01 I need my oil changed shit mad high lol

230 2018-05-31 23:36:36 It's amazing that you still reason this way. Too bad. "Oil" you say, and I ask, what would make someone think of such when the people of South-East also has oil, and besides we in the Southeast don't depend on oil for survival. People in SE and SS are one people of Biafra nation.
231 2018-05-31 23:36:33 I didn’t say where we got are oil from. Reread the tweet...please.
232 2018-05-31 23:36:22 @theresa_may Friendly message from a Canadian citizen @JustinTrudeau said no more oil subsidies then he bought a pipeline, said he would respect indigenous rights, he is ignoring them & health gap is worse than ever - watch your back ;)
233 2018-05-31 23:36:15 I'm not sure about 90%, but, the bulk of oil is within Scottish waters, and yes, we would be taking control of all of it.
234 2018-05-31 23:36:12 Pretty weak Sullivan. Not much to say about our other allies, the EU, Mexico, Canada. What will you do? You such a zero for oil. He owns you doesn’t he?
235 2018-05-31 23:36:09 Whenever gas gets more expensive like this I can’t help but wonder if some of it might be donkey Kong’s fault for throwing all those barrels of oil around when he was trying to date Pauline back in the 80’s. #Conspiracy
236 2018-05-31 23:35:46 Separating belief from theory is s bit like separating oil from water. Both have their place but mistaking one for the other is catastrophic.
237 2018-05-31 23:35:46 Management of available infrastructure is responsibility of next govt. 6,000 MW supply is by furnace oil, its costly. So, if caretaker finance division will not allocate funding for this electric generation then off course, they would be shortfall.

242 2018-05-31 23:35:18 Pernia and Diokno shouldn't compare the economic trends in 2018 (Duterte) to those in 2008 (Arroyo). The population, the labor force, and the unemployed Filipinos then were lesser. Also, Arroyo increased the minimum wage, cut the oil import tariff, and implemented cash transfers.

244 2018-05-31 23:34:57 Re the Iranian revolution; hate to break this to you but we pretty much scammed the Yanks into doing it for us to get back the oil companies that the Iranians, (for largely justifiable reasons), had nicked. This is why the US wouldn't help us with Suez.
245 2018-05-31 23:34:55 me to its our thing brooklyners say  erl for oil . i had cousins there too in green point.
246 2018-05-31 23:34:55 I just use the Neutrogena hydro boost line. I have sensitive skin and I need oil free products that doesn’t clog my pores. It works fine for me.  
247 2018-05-31 23:34:45 The Altona Refinery is a blight on the West of Melbourne. Spewing pollution and odours 24 hours a day, ruining the air quality for 100,000s of people for the benefit of a multinational oil company. Fossil fuels are a dying industry and the sooner the refinery closes the better.
248 2018-05-31 23:34:35 Did you take a poll...btw I asked for the facts from someone that worked at STC not a computer geek from the university. And there still isn’t any windmills on the oil wells in South East Sask that you told me about.

257 2018-05-31 23:33:06 #Canada's impotence in a trade war with the U.S. is overstated. Beyond our banks' stake in their economy, Trump's energy plan depends on #Canadian oil and hydro supply. U.S. firms' easy access to our abundant natural resources is no small bargaining chip either.  #canpoli

264 2018-05-31 23:31:42 Mr Minister judging by your talk it's impossible from your side that you will atleast make a effort to reduce the oil prices. You just be back of RG and people will show you the exit door in May 2019 when by this time you would have already accepted your defeat.
265 2018-05-31 23:31:30 Episcopalians sometimes do the Seusscharist. Google it. 
266 2018-05-31 23:31:29 160k km sorry. And that's the price to replace the battery pack. YMMV. We also make sure to keep up with regular oil changes and such too. And if you use the braking mode appropriately, your brakes should have a lifetime guarantee.
267 2018-05-31 23:31:29 Good now demand on the power grid for gas oil go up and reduced income from sale tax from gasoline. Dirty lithium mining goes up win win.
268 2018-05-31 23:31:19 Chelsea can't afford his wages with Roman pulling all his oil money out. They'll be being managed by Denis Wise in League Two in a few years.

271 2018-05-31 23:30:59 Apparently the UK cannot according to all those remoaners. Guess that includes Scotland. It is nothing to do with capability - if you found more oil then it would become feasible. England has London. Infrastructure in Scotland is more expensive to provide due to topography.
272 2018-05-31 23:30:44 I'm Episcopalian so clearly I missed out
273 2018-05-31 23:30:42 Ah, that money that is now going to make sure a Texas-based company gets even richer? Makes sense. I’m sure the oil companies would love funding energy sources that will make them obsolete.
274 2018-05-31 23:30:41 Sorry Senator, but once again u are wrong. Our Planet has experienced many Global Warming events in its 4.5 billion year history. CO2 emissions from Volcanic eruptions have contributed far more CO2 than man has. Having said that, of course we should faze out coal. oil etc in time
275 2018-05-31 23:30:32 Prescription strength fish oil?? WHAT is HAPPENing.
276 2018-05-31 23:30:19 ...I often think of hydrogen based transport as the geoengineering project that could be achieved when do many others are unrealistic or counterproductive. Shift oil subsidy to hydrogen and solar immediately and we have a future.
277 2018-05-31 23:30:12 hey I would just like to let all of you know I finally got my oil changed
278 2018-05-31 23:30:02 Assuming the Canadians don't shut it down first so they can ship the oil to China instead

You wouldn't happen to know how I could send Pauline some Evening Primrose Oil? 
285 2018-05-31 23:29:31 Please give Oil.prices graph also
286 2018-05-31 23:29:03 We already get our oil from foreign sources. That bitumen isn’t meant for us, it goes to China and the US. Do your research please.
287 2018-05-31 23:28:59 You export virtually nothing anymore and import far more than Scotland. You don't have the natural resources. Scotland has whisky, oil, energy, fish, seafood, beef and many other food products, the gaming industry in Dundee and much more......all crucial to UK revenue.
288 2018-05-31 23:28:28 #oilprice was hoping for at least a double top at 80. If the global economy can't sustain above 70, we got trouble. Trade wars won't be good for #Oil
289 2018-05-31 23:28:22 Goddammit. As an Illinois native I gotta say, the last thing we need is Trump meddling in our politics. Like pouring oil into muddy water.
290 2018-05-31 23:28:15 Ohhhh, I forgot - when community groups speak up, it's a problem. When it's big oil and gas, it's all good....
291 2018-05-31 23:28:08 Blows my fucking mind when I see people wearing oil hats just saw someone wearing he name of an oil company
292 2018-05-31 23:28:00 I actually don’t think it can do that. I’m pretty sure I’m at least 85% coconut oil and I haven’t caught anything in like a week.
293 2018-05-31 23:27:39 agree ,but the tax on oil is down to our government 
price on petrol same as UK
but in UK they take 85% tax 
so how much of the price you control
294 2018-05-31 23:27:07 How interesting! I went back to flower because I got super tired of oil
295 2018-05-31 23:27:05 'Oil free night time mask' they said... 'use the whole sample in one go' they said.... ive never seen my face SHINE SO MUCH AND BE SO OILYYY
296 2018-05-31 23:26:59 I have a new dream, to see Edward James Olmos and Ian McShane oil up and fight. Alternatively, I'd like to see them have a growly debate about who makes the best smoothies.
297 2018-05-31 23:26:56 Yup and no need to constantly seed skies with aluminium etc that poisons everybody. Existing major rivers and lakes would reestablish flow and the oceans would be more normal in temperature, the jetstream would stay quick and we don't all have to die yay!. Oil must be killed.
298 2018-05-31 23:26:49 I guess im done drinking monster going to have to start drinking peak motor oil instead lol !!!!!!!
299 2018-05-31 23:26:48 On super dry/ damaged/ sensitive skin coconut oil can be irritating  which really sucks for me
300 2018-05-31 23:26:47 Who does pay the profit of the american's investidors of Petrobras brazilian oil company ? Brazilian poor and middle class, health, educational and social programs.
301 2018-05-31 23:26:42 Well I agree Pruitt is a huge sack of shit so whatever it takes to get him removed I'm all for. He's supposed to protect the environment not cave to big oil and Donald Dotard. 
#FirePruitt
302 2018-05-31 23:26:34 Russia has been losing huge amounts of money with oil prices so low. Dismantling the Iran Nuclear deal is critical to Russia thereby destabilizing the area and In effect raising oil prices. It’s working just as planned. Common Americans loose again.
303 2018-05-31 23:26:30 I'm laying down with a crippling migraine and Matt goes to the store to "get me a surprise". He comes back with peppermint oil because he looked up natural remedies for headaches and wanted to help. How was I blessed with this man
304 2018-05-31 23:26:25 Heard rumors China has setup a gold for oil swap somewhere. Hong Kong, maybe?

324 2018-05-31 23:23:11 Thank US for screwing us, not like we haven't been your most loyal business ally selling Texans oil for discounted price for years from Alberta. For no good reason you've made your own lives more expensive. We always supported you. You're unfogiveable.
325 2018-05-31 23:23:07 Pernia and Diokno shouldn't compare the economic trends in 2018 (Duterte) to those in 2008 (Arroyo). The population, the labor force, and the unemployed Filipinos then were lesser. Also, Arroyo increased the minimum wage, cut the oil import tariff, and implemented cash transfers.
326 2018-05-31 23:23:01 Pax Pods with Select Oil are now here! Come check us out with the exclusive product line :)

329 2018-05-31 23:22:47 The US buys about 50% of its crude oil from Canada.  I guess a 25% tariff on that would be fair, too.  See who bends first.....
330 2018-05-31 23:22:35 well done, and theologically sound

333 2018-05-31 23:22:21 brussel sprouts are actually really good if you cut them in half long-ways, toss them in light olive oil with seasonings (salt, pepper, garlic power, onion powder, smoked paprika, etc), place them face-down on a foiled pan, and put them in the oven for ~40 min at 420 degrees.
334 2018-05-31 23:22:16 Smoke @BarewoodOG J-Pods. They’re cannabis oil pods. ;)

341 2018-05-31 23:21:07 "Youths, not oil, are Nigeria’s most important resource."
 - @MBuhari as he signs the #NotTooYoungToRun bill
342 2018-05-31 23:20:57 Might be an idea to ask them why the Arabs blew up their electricity conductors , pissed off the PA so much they limited electric supplies to Gaza, burnt all their tyre supplies, destroyed their oil and gas pipes at Kerem Shalom, wasted foreign aid to build terror tunnels etc
343 2018-05-31 23:20:56 Management of available infrastructure is responsibility of next govt. 6,000 MW supply is by furnace oil, its costly. So, if caretaker finance division will not allocate funding for this much electric generation then off course, they would be response.
344 2018-05-31 23:20:52 I lived thru 5 boom/bust cycles in Alberta over 3 decades. There is no job security from oil anyway. 

Agree there is no plan. But there could be. And $4.5 ( or $15) billion going to a renewables instead of a pipeline would be a good start, no?
345 2018-05-31 23:20:50 20% of Canada's GDP comes from goods it exports to the US, oil natural gas and electricity. None of which we need, Canada has no leverage.

347 2018-05-31 23:20:47 Thus, if a region of a hitherto united entity should secede, they are entitled to a pro-rata percentage of that resource, related to their population. An independent Scotland would therefore be entitled to 9 per cent of the oil revenues, not 90 per cent.
348 2018-05-31 23:20:42 Why do you think vegetable oil can't be incorporated into a healthy diet?
349 2018-05-31 23:20:40 Thank goodness we have masters who can try and get us to fetch, sit and roll over.

Maybe we'll even get a biscuit for some oil.....

Maybe that's what they meant when we were told "LEAD, don't leave".

352 2018-05-31 23:20:19 I need my oil changed and tires rotated

357 2018-05-31 23:19:40 There seems to be an assumption that if the Scots were ever to vote to secede from the Union, they would take 90 per cent of the oil with them.

390 2018-05-31 23:16:55 Hi idk you but vitamin E oil works so well for dry skin and it’s cheap at like Target. I switch between that and aloe Vera (not gel straight from the leaf). That helps me with dryness too.

394 2018-05-31 23:15:58 4- for the oil market to be regional, doesn't mean climate change analysis has to be regional. you can always aggregate.  I see no contradiction here.
395 2018-05-31 23:15:56 Rockefeller, a businessman involved in the oil industry used horizontal integration to control the oil industry in America. He created the standard oil trusts. This was a legal strategy around illegal monopolies, but served the same purpose. #GGC18HIST3225

410 2018-05-31 23:15:08 The point is Trump lies when he has to know what he's said before is on video with him speaking,that shows he doesn't care if people believe him or not,he knows his followers will slide along on his "snake oil " lies until he lights the match & they go poof

414 2018-05-31 23:14:54 1- OPEC is NOT a cartel (Monopoly), but the oil market is not competitive either. Hence the talk about Oligopoly.
2- Swing producer within its limitations of investment and spare capacity 
3- The oil market is more regional than global, hence we have all the price differentials
415 2018-05-31 23:14:52 Had a wonderful, enlightening conversation with this old man while getting my oil changed, and I’m grateful God placed him in my path today.
416 2018-05-31 23:14:32 LOL that's funny.  Maybe he should understand once it's shut off, the Canadians better start pumping oil and making youtube videos.  Stuff is going south like the EU.
417 2018-05-31 23:14:28 Oil prices are low and not stable. There are issues over what UK assets would belong to Scotland and what share of UK Government debt would belong to Scotland. It would be a long and protracted negotiation. Richard S Grossman, Professor of economics

430 2018-05-31 23:12:32 Seems to me the federal government and the owner of the oil are the beneficiaries of the taxes and income from ownership of the oil.  There is a legal means to recover or get reimbursed. The problem is BC has no constitutional right to prohibit shipment of oil on the ocean.

437 2018-05-31 23:12:01 Well you sat on your hands for all oil workers..
438 2018-05-31 23:11:58 I feel bad for the people who have siblings and their parents always chose and did things for one but not the other. Buys them cars, let’s them use there cars when there’s doesn’t work or doesn’t have oil, but can’t let the other use a phone no one else uses. Makes sense 
439 2018-05-31 23:11:53 Obama was out of touch. Like when he took the high road and told Americans that Trump would never sit in his seat.  He was America's snake oil salesman.  Lied to your face with a smile and was able to make you fall in love with him. Too bad
440 2018-05-31 23:11:48 @JustinTrudeau @liberal_party Steel down Oil down liberal must be in power. Screwing CND up daily can’t get a ONE pipeline in or make a trade deal #TrudeauMustGO
441 2018-05-31 23:11:45 I hope gas prices go up to $4 a gallon. That means America will start drilling for it's own oil again and put many out of work Americans back in a job. If you can't pay for gas, get a better job or sell your car.

2.  Okay, so of OPEC doesn't maintain market share, how's it behave then?
3.  I dunno, oil market is pretty global, climate is global, how does that apply here?

446 2018-05-31 23:11:21 A hard border between England & Scotland? I think you would need a sudden discovery of more North Sea oil to survive well. You could actually end up like Greece. We are better together.

453 2018-05-31 23:10:35 Cindy, the only advice I could give you is to keep ‘practicing’ quitting. I practiced many times throughout the years and have finally stopped. Buy yourself a bottle of black pepper essential oil and sniff that sucker any time you get a craving. It helped me. Good luck!

460 2018-05-31 23:10:11 The only answer is ...fuck them. Cut the oil the lumber the water and electricity.  @realDonaldTrump is a fucking disaster for the world.  Let's build better trade allies with Mexico and Europe.  We really don't need the USA.  They need Canada more.

464 2018-05-31 23:09:20 Limonine is the active chemical in Orange oil. Best thing I've ever found for cleaning sticky things, degreasing, and removing ink. It will melt styrofoam, is relatively safe for human contact, and it smells like an orange grove. :-)
465 2018-05-31 23:09:19 Oil futures are down
Give it some time. Prices dont stay stable forever. We havent had inflation in a long long time either.

472 2018-05-31 23:08:03 Oh, I know it was a huge honor to be asked. I just felt a little weird about it. I'm Baptist by tradition, and we don't hold with female ministers.
473 2018-05-31 23:08:01 @probesreporter confirms that you have an ongoing SEC investigation & this is your reply? Pathetic

$ZN's tactic is to write misleading press releases w/ no data and then never disclose actual well results?

It'd be called a "Pump&Dump" but there is NO OIL to Pump from the Well

476 2018-05-31 23:07:40 I know of one, the murderer pastor told her she will die if the lump is removed, she kept buying annoiting oil, fasting, deliverance and all.  Her case became worse and she eventually died, even at the point of death she was blaming village people
477 2018-05-31 23:07:33 Fucking love @Groupon i got my oil changed for the low!!!
478 2018-05-31 23:07:28 The future wars will not be on oil, gold but Water.

488 2018-05-31 23:06:26 Do you mean shut down Eastern Canada? Because that's what would happen if you shut down oil exports to our only customer, who happens to be the largest supplier of petroleum to Eastern Canada. You can bet the U.S. would just turn off that supply.

496 2018-05-31 23:05:34 Nonsense — today crude oil @ $67 a barrel vs $110 per barrel before he became pres.  ur higher gas price due solely to increase in local taxes needed to maintain the insane level of free stuff given to buy votes for progressives.. but then facts are not part of ur world
497 2018-05-31 23:05:27 You say that like it doesn't mean as much as it truly does.

•couldn’t reach the top part of my back to put tanning oil on (it all worked out)

529 2018-05-31 23:02:19 So Alberta can continue to get its oil to the market so it (Alberta) can continue to make Billions in equalization payments which many provinces including Nunavut benefit from.

532 2018-05-31 23:02:14 But that wasn’t what they were saying. It was simply that SK was doing great, AB was tanking and has nothing to do with oil price, it’s NDP compared to Wall. SKs oil industry was hurting too but economy being less reliant on O&G was why they did better at the time.
533 2018-05-31 23:02:10 The case for restrictive supply-side policies for coal is a lot stronger than for oil and gas, in my view.
534 2018-05-31 23:01:54 @POTUS We poor/middle class are not buying the excuse that sanction on IRAN are driving oil and gasoline price's up.

577 2018-05-31 22:57:45 Okay. I'll leave you alone with your fantasies.  Scotland has a similar population and oil income to Scotland. As well as having the best quality of life in the world, Norway has an oil reserve fund equivalent to 1 million euros for every single citizen.

588 2018-05-31 22:57:03 The ‘whataboutism’ is oil proponents favourite.
589 2018-05-31 22:57:02 Heck yes!!!!
590 2018-05-31 22:56:50 I actually do. Ordained and everything.
591 2018-05-31 22:56:42 Another guy wants me to do his oil change on his bike lmfao this is lit
592 2018-05-31 22:56:42 We've been consistent all along." So the correct nomenclature in the HPI is 'Mbpd' for 'million barrels per day" ?? Good to have learned something after more than 25 years in the industry (including posts with major oil companies...). Thks.
593 2018-05-31 22:56:33 I'm performing many ceremonies. I, myself, am not getting married.
594 2018-05-31 22:56:25 I’m not much for the polygamy thing myself, cult ceremony it is! Can it be a book cult please? For avid readers!

596 2018-05-31 22:56:11 So, we have all this extra oil being produced.....but prices are skyrocketing..projected to reach 2X what they were under Obama....what the hell is going on....are big oil companys getting rich on the taxpayer again ?? The GOP MAGA
597 2018-05-31 22:56:09 This story has been cover all day be the so called MSM, with much outrage, so their is no need to imagine. I have another question. can you imagine if a presidential press secretary lied about WMDs sending +4k American Service members to die over oil in the desert? The outrage...
598 2018-05-31 22:56:07 All of those are great choices! I usually use coconut oil.
599 2018-05-31 22:56:05 I just can't imagine that. It's insane to me.
600 2018-05-31 22:56:00 I need to go get my oil change tomorrow
601 2018-05-31 22:55:55 And how the f*ck if you know the make model and engine type do you get an “almost works” oil filter? @bigotires I get why no one has walked in here since I arrived 1.5 hours ago
602 2018-05-31 22:55:48 It’s baby oil then cocoa butter on top
603 2018-05-31 22:55:38 Im about to abuse this castor oil, only used this shit one day & i see a difference
604 2018-05-31 22:55:32 Find other markets for our goods. Like sending oil east. If we turned off their oil that would hurt.
605 2018-05-31 22:55:27 Tried tree oil mint shampoo and my head is having an orgasm rn
606 2018-05-31 22:55:26 I won’t drink after people but I have been using receipts as oil blotters. Uhm yeah wut the fck cameo
607 2018-05-31 22:55:25 So. My sister in law brought home anointing oil. She is convienced the devil is attaching our house.. she is praying and rolling this shit on all the doorways! 

I’ve seen wayyyy to many scary movies for this to end good...
608 2018-05-31 22:55:25 I'm struggling to take you seriously now. North Sea Oil has been of no benefit to the UK ? Come on.
609 2018-05-31 22:55:16 Burn it. Give it to a hobo as TP. Use it to clean up the next BP oil spill. Your options are unlimited

I start with cubes of my amazing breads, I add my organic herbs, and cracked black pepper, toss with a drizzle of olive oil, and toast until golden!
A crowd favorite!
614 2018-05-31 22:54:30 The aroma of garlic being sauteed in olive oil can take you anywhere

619 2018-05-31 22:54:15 Says the Frenchman buying Iranian Oil via Russian Pipelines.
620 2018-05-31 22:54:10 Just make sure you moisturized. Start with some type of gel and water and oil
621 2018-05-31 22:53:50 Trump and Putin want to divide us from Europe. Trump has one job weaken America. We already gave Russian 20 trillion in oil deals wirh Iran. Mexico now trades with Europe not us. We have give China aid and take out loans from them. As stores and factories close here.
622 2018-05-31 22:53:44 There is actually a show on TV (I have never watched) called Sister wives. When I see those commercials I always think "What an A hole".
623 2018-05-31 22:53:33 Any nation state who would call or think of themselves as the guardian of the world while also sitting on their hands for Rwanda and Darfur and the Rohingya people is a pretty fucking shitty guardian. We "guard" where there is oil and $ to be made. It's pretty simple.
624 2018-05-31 22:53:28 Any wonder, we are giving them our oil at huge discounts
625 2018-05-31 22:53:18 Bubba blue.. 
626 2018-05-31 22:53:16 There you go.. now turn off the taps of all oil/gas pipelines & electricity goin to the states.. lol
627 2018-05-31 22:53:07 Tea tree oil and put a bandaid over it so your skin soaks up the product :D
628 2018-05-31 22:52:56 Where is your evidence that you're gonna get 90% of Oil revenue? It's a massively complicated issue that will likely take years to resolve

630 2018-05-31 22:52:48 Trump is starting a trade war with....wait for it...our allies.  We are at the height of the market.  Oil prices contracting.  Housing overvalued.  Gee, I wonder what will happen? #notConfused
631 2018-05-31 22:52:43 U can cut up some good potatoes, drizzle some olive oil, sprinkle some salt, black pepper and paprika then bake those babies till they’re golden brown and perfect. My fav way to have them! 
632 2018-05-31 22:52:33 Defo btw long as there’s no palm oil
633 2018-05-31 22:52:32 I’m super oily. Like I mean scrape my face off at the end of the day and you’d have enough oil to deep fry some chips at McDonald’s. I’ve bought now 99% of all the makeup you and Sam have recommended to me and it’s all on mah face right now
634 2018-05-31 22:52:31 So petrol has been racing up apparently due to oil prices and the exchange rate. So our dollar is up over half a cent and crude is down 4 bucks a barrel and I don’t see any reductions ? Up fast down slow ! #petrol
635 2018-05-31 22:52:24 Prime Minister Mia Mottley mentioned the increase in global oil prices is a concern for Barbados going forward; she wants Bajans to pray that we don’t get hit by any natural disasters this summer. #highlightsfrommiaspressconference #prayerforbarbados

637 2018-05-31 22:52:17 @bigotires day 2. Brought my other car in and was just told the oil filter we ordered is close but not that close to work on your car. After I asked yesterday if they had one. #CustomerExperience #fail #shameonme no 3rd chance
638 2018-05-31 22:52:03 The thought of a sheep covered in motor oil fixing a car gave me joy
639 2018-05-31 22:51:52 Dude asking a CVS employee:

652 2018-05-31 22:50:26 Koch brothers lick chops over chance to steal oil
653 2018-05-31 22:50:19 Well you are a good cook so it could be worse!
654 2018-05-31 22:50:15 But oil is down $5 a barrel....
655 2018-05-31 22:50:14 Welp, she's a farm girl so you never know.
656 2018-05-31 22:50:08 @JustinTrudeau I hate you and everything but if America wants to put tariffs on us for metals why don't do the same to them with oil I am willing to bet trumps entire fortune America breaks first in that tariff battle
657 2018-05-31 22:50:02 I want an oil diffuser if anyone loves me
658 2018-05-31 22:49:35 my co worker literally didn’t know about little caesars.... guess I wouldn’t know either if my dad worked in oil ahaha
659 2018-05-31 22:49:34 Customers were fleeing in droves, druggies shooting up in the bathroom.  Place stunk and I'm not talking about the employees' patchouli oil.
660 2018-05-31 22:49:31 I hear cbd oil works wonders for pain, a lot of people have replaced pain meds with it. (Not a Dr. Not offering medical advice, it's worth researching.) I'm sorry he's in pain, pls thank him for his service & sacrifice

668 2018-05-31 22:48:05 Was that back when they found oil in Canada?
669 2018-05-31 22:48:04 Plain add sriracha and olive oil and mix it up.
670 2018-05-31 22:48:04 That underlying picture though...
671 2018-05-31 22:48:03 It's a way to keep petrol consumption in check. We aren't gifted plenty of oil resources. Habits don't change easily, especially on societal levels. We don't want to get used to high consumption of a resource that we don't have supply of and depend on imports.
672 2018-05-31 22:47:47 I also cant find my orange oil. Smh
673 2018-05-31 22:47:46 ... this could either mean you are getting hitched to multiple folks, or that you have started a strange cult and are presiding over a mass marriage ceremony... I’m going with the last one!
674 2018-05-31 22:47:41 He is owned by the same oil goons that every other president since Nixon was owned by.

Don't kid yourself. He's reckless and loud, but he's doing the bidding of the elite and the military industrial complex.
675 2018-05-31 22:47:22 Ha, just watch what they can do. How about sell their oil to China instead of us, when our fracked oil runs out in a year or two. Can you say $6.00 a gallon gas?
676 2018-05-31 22:46:58 Unfortunately, this is my senator.A bigoted, close-minded, corrupt, fake evangelical.He makes me sick.

679 2018-05-31 22:46:17 Yes, we sell our oil to them at a discount because this government can’t get a pipeline built.
680 2018-05-31 22:46:10 Today was Geno's first day with no destruction in the house since starting his behavior problems again! We gave him CBD Oil treats and it appears to have helped.
681 2018-05-31 22:46:08 Hi Shelby, my wife & I sought out natural solutions to avoid conventional meds & found success w/essential oils. She runs an endo support site but the oil education is universal. Feel free to DM me if you’re open to hearing more about our experiences.
682 2018-05-31 22:45:49 Heck yes! I'm marrying everybody today!!!
683 2018-05-31 22:45:45 Rappers with baby oil in their and shit.
684 2018-05-31 22:45:43 Remember the oil is Scottish, the whisky, Fishing,.. Nerd to sort out some issues with welfare culture (Ive been away for nearly 30 years, but I remember it was a problem. Times am back I sense there is still an issue. Nothing giving incentives and opportunity won't address
685 2018-05-31 22:45:41 Jamaican black caster oil line be bomb but it’s kinda expensive like 10$ a piece
686 2018-05-31 22:45:40 It’s sad when you don’t wanna attend your big sisters baby shower for her first baby because your white girlfriend needs an oil change
687 2018-05-31 22:45:22 We need their oil so I'm sure May et al will always keep them happy.
688 2018-05-31 22:45:19 the US needs our oil &gas.  It's about 43% of their use, and it's 99% of our exports. 

We ship it to them by pipeline and rail while losing $15B a year in GDP.

the TMX would have given us our GDP back, but US funders pay Canadians to protest ourselves. 

great system.  #cdnpoli
689 2018-05-31 22:45:15 Yep it distorts it in a financially beneficial way seemingly....you'd be in trouble had you voted to leave with oil prices plumetting.....
690 2018-05-31 22:45:14 Taraweeh was a traumatic experience, the burps from the guy on my right smelt like oil and obesity.

691 2018-05-31 22:45:12 I wonder if the ppl that protest big oil ever think of all the things made of oil #Platics #Roads #YourPriusBattery #YourLatteCup #YourBike #HospitalProducts #WakeUp
692 2018-05-31 22:45:07 @arvindpawan1 
1-2 Sorry, Peter, theoretically, the model does NOT work that way. Supply and demand analysis are only used in a competitive market. All experts agree that the oil market is not competitive. An oligopoly model must be used.

697 2018-05-31 22:44:35 I wasn’t sure what kind of oil my car took, so I just used canola.
698 2018-05-31 22:44:34 Syria was such a beautiful place  and the people are seriously so kind. They don't deserve to be in the middle of a war over oil access. This stuff makes me hate our govt. They send our troops over there to serve interests that are wrong... Hope your son stays safe
699 2018-05-31 22:44:26 おめでとう!!!!私もほしいいいい
700 2018-05-31 22:44:24 found some oil in my room. I think I'll gift it to Tatsu.

702 2018-05-31 22:44:06 He didn't go there to kill people. And he didn't go there to secure the US' hold on oil, and he didn't go there to ruin lives or destroy families. And I think this is true of most soldiers. So don't support the war, but definitely support our troops.
703 2018-05-31 22:44:06 Then it doesnt matter what statistics I cite or give you to show you the improvement in both Air or Water quality.. your going to disagree.. and if your close to 50 you should remember the claims that we were going to be out of oil and Florida already was going to be under water
704 2018-05-31 22:44:05 I also really like their Black Truffle Oil
705 2018-05-31 22:43:54 @realDonaldTrump OK YOU. Our goods are too bad for U-S? Don't want Canadian kootie's? Canada doesn't need to dig itself into any more holes!

710 2018-05-31 22:42:52 I remember working on a car once I put it up on a hoist looked under it and there was a plastic Walmart bag crammed in between the oil pan
711 2018-05-31 22:42:44 Make sure you cleanse your face daily and exfoliate twice a week since you said there’s excessive oil , and make sure your foundation isn’t comedogenic that clogs up your pores as well
712 2018-05-31 22:42:37 The fact that I’m at Jiffy Lube, in the lil sitting area, waiting for the completion of my oil change & i just remembered that i have open/finished bottles of alcohol & pregnancy tests in my back seat

715 2018-05-31 22:42:09 As soon s you apologize to Obama, to McCain, To the Khans, to Hillary, to PR, to Chuck Todd, to Comey, to federal law enforcement, to minorities. Also apologize to your base for lying to them and for being a conman selling them snake oil. That's a start.
716 2018-05-31 22:42:01 If the man walking to work why would offset buy the nigga something that’s gonna be expensive to maintain.... have y’all ever gotten an oil change on an s550 Benz???
717 2018-05-31 22:41:53 Bath: Shaved, hair mask, face mask, body butter and body oil. I feel AMAZING right now.
718 2018-05-31 22:41:37 Use an oil with a high smoke point - like grapeseed. Guarantees a better sear. Bacon fat is also a delicious option.
719 2018-05-31 22:41:35 Oil, gas and water, turn the taps off . We can make our own Quiche at home .
720 2018-05-31 22:41:27 no one has ever acknowledged that my lewd tier on patreon being named “oil panic” is a dick joke and tbh it just shows i’m ahead of my time and you’re all Uncultured
721 2018-05-31 22:41:21 Roseanne oil and water does not mix.  Get over it.
722 2018-05-31 22:41:17 I heard that trump will be discussing the US strategic oil reserves with Bart Simpson tomorrow.

In the end I think trump just likes being around porno stars.
723 2018-05-31 22:41:08 that was oil not lube WHAT
724 2018-05-31 22:41:06 There are plenty of women working in the winter trucking stations in the Barrens. Can you guess what it is that they do for a living? Such women have always been a common fixture wherever there are many working men in isolated places, such as in oil pipeline construction terrain.
725 2018-05-31 22:40:49 Mom:I’m cold
Dad:I have oil in the garage go set yourself on fire

733 2018-05-31 22:40:18 Canada has the best beer. Big and micro breweries abound. We are a self sustaining country. We are rich in oil and lumber, clean water hydro and natural gas. We also have strict gun laws health care and won’t build a wall. Fuck Trump. 
734 2018-05-31 22:40:12 油揚げって言うほど油って感じしなくない？ほんとに騙された気分だよ。
735 2018-05-31 22:39:51 you've probably heard this a million times but coconut oil, regular deep conditioning (once or twice a week), regular clarifying, and dry oil sprays helped me SO much when i went platinum blonde... my hair would have been a frizzy mess without these
736 2018-05-31 22:39:46 How did my $40 oil change turn into a $400 repair bill??  
737 2018-05-31 22:39:41 Canadian prime minister has become CEO of an oil company run by taxpayers money! Theft!!!
738 2018-05-31 22:39:32 give me the coconut oil that stuff work wonders !!!
739 2018-05-31 22:39:29 you know we love cuticle oil lol
740 2018-05-31 22:39:25 I’m just slicker than niggas like olive oil
741 2018-05-31 22:39:14 Of course Jamaican black castor oil shea moisture is sold out every time I check 
742 2018-05-31 22:38:57 Try using something like lavender oil 
743 2018-05-31 22:38:16 Not a war movie.. Per se.. Not like full metal jacket.  I’d bet you’d like the movie. Very limited war scenes.. Go ahead MSSgt, “Life is like a box of chocolates, sometimes you’re pleasantly surprised and not disqusted”. 
744 2018-05-31 22:38:05 My heart hurts. Never take a day for granted. Love and prayers to Ofy and our OIL Families 
745 2018-05-31 22:37:58 Talk is cheap - why doesn't the Senate vote to overthrow the illegally elected Maduro government?. A naval blockade will squeeze their oil exports & arming the opposition & asking the army to mutiny should work under current conditions.
746 2018-05-31 22:37:56 .@NBCNightlyNews #TradeWars with American allies *say goodbye* to middle class *tax cuts for the rich* the increase in oil prices, health care costs & now tariffs will completely eat away any pennies middle class received from the stupid @realDonaldTrump tax cuts for the rich
747 2018-05-31 22:37:53 OIL UR HAIR
748 2018-05-31 22:37:52 And remember, this is for those that are deemed terminally ill. I can't just walk up and ask for a bottle of snake oil if I want.
749 2018-05-31 22:37:49 We literally tried with Energy East and the PQ blocked it too. It is entirely complete up to your great province on both sides. It would stopped almost all foreign oil from coming into the country.
750 2018-05-31 22:37:45 Keluaran baru kleveru ini wkwk tapi pake vit e oil ke bibir jg udah lembab gt
751 2018-05-31 22:37:43 If you haven’t done it already take Benadryl and apply a cold compress! In school they also taught us to use Olive Oil but I’m not sure how good that works.
752 2018-05-31 22:37:20 Cold brew n a oil pen r one crazy thing to have together my body is trippin lol

756 2018-05-31 22:36:43 Babbling Idiot, Stop Repeating Yourself.

You're starting a #WorldWideTradeWar
and America will be left holding the bag.
Inflation, Higher oil prices, loss of jobs, recession, depression, default, costlier goods and ISOLATION.

761 2018-05-31 22:36:20 I’m using tea tree oil since it’s a natural big repellent!! But I still got another 2 days of this,,, pray 4 me
762 2018-05-31 22:36:14 She absolutely did as have many liberals. I wonder what would have happened if a conservative implied the same thing about Barack or Bill and their daughters. Blood would have flowed in the streets. Disgusting. What happened to respect for the office?
763 2018-05-31 22:36:08 By the way, we note no US tariff is being applied to Canadian oil to US. Does America still need that Alberta export? US oil security still a thing US? China is an option and a new pipeline to BC coast just confirmed.

Just saying.
764 2018-05-31 22:35:29 @JustinTrudeau @liberal_party funds anti oil activists but refuses to give funding to Christian groups that use it to hire students to do charitable work. #TrudeauMustGo
765 2018-05-31 22:35:21 I use lavender so I do. I use Lavender essential oil When havin a bath.
766 2018-05-31 22:35:17 Yeah, I’m good, just had a few drops of oil land on the back of my hand... Wasn’t the first time, I’m positive it won’t be the last... And just some sausage...
767 2018-05-31 22:35:05 I got my own oil ma’am that’s the point smh and you shouldn’t like tf
768 2018-05-31 22:35:04 Eco-fascists & the #CBC crying about a 100 litre spill at #TransMountainPipeline last week. 100 literally is less than 1 barrel of oil. 

Where were these hypocrites when BP was churning 25,000 barrels a day into the Gulf Of Mexico? 

#hypocrites #cdnpoli #abpoli
769 2018-05-31 22:34:51 2 nights ago I used a diffuser to anoint my bedroom with lavender essential oil. I slept well but was groggy on Wednesday. I drank half a pint of Hawaiian craft brew last night and went to bed past midnight. I was not hung over this morning yet have a lot of energy. Hmm
770 2018-05-31 22:34:26 Today's campaign finance reports show oil and gas companies Chevron and Mack Energy supporting Democratic candidates Carl Trujillo in HD 46,  Debbie Rodella in HD 41, and George Munoz in land commissioner race. #nmpol
771 2018-05-31 22:34:26 How are people on offsets neck for buying dude a Altima??? If he got him a luxury car he probably wouldn’t be able to pay for an oil change
772 2018-05-31 22:34:25 Sun Oil - yes, mama ok? #Nowplaying
773 2018-05-31 22:34:17 The FDA also oversees the safety of all, as in those who don't want snake oil in absolutely everything without their consent. Let the idiots drink up their poison if they want. Next up is assisted suicide for those that wish.
774 2018-05-31 22:34:09 @INFINITIUSA so disappointed in your bait and switch sales tactics. Paid 1299 for full maintenance during my 3 year lease to find out I only have coverage for oil changes. Even customer care won’t rectify it.  I know how much an oil change costs. This fight isn’t over

776 2018-05-31 22:34:00 Water isn’t innately wet because being wet is having a different liquid on something. Water can, however, be wet if someone puts oil on it
777 2018-05-31 22:33:59 There’s a grandpa at the pool with his grandkids and he offered me some of his tanning oil, what a guy
778 2018-05-31 22:33:39 Lucky after the UK went begging to the IMF all that Scottish oil started flowing - and still does today though eh - 33% of all exports, 250,000 employed in rUK, £15 billion supply industry 
779 2018-05-31 22:33:28 London is the financial heart of the WHOLE of the UK including Scotland, which saw its public finances badly affected by the plunge in global oil prices, and ran a deficit of £2,830 a head.
780 2018-05-31 22:33:15 So he should have gave him a $80k car that he couldn’t afford the oil changes on?
781 2018-05-31 22:33:15 @bouldercanyon makes the best chips ever. I’ve tried the avo oil and coconut oil and they’re both perfection! need to try the bbq ones!!
782 2018-05-31 22:33:12 Have to go spend money on stuff for an oil change because I don’t wanna take Spence to a shop, help
783 2018-05-31 22:33:11 I finally got my oil change this morning 
784 2018-05-31 22:33:07 What are you gonna do .. you can cripple them only by way of oil which would hurt us just as much.. It’s important to stand united but to also realize we’re a needle in America’s haystack economically. Very easily lose lose for us

787 2018-05-31 22:32:32 .@Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!
788 2018-05-31 22:32:31 And oil is becoming obsolete....
789 2018-05-31 22:32:29 I wish I would’ve been able to use cannabis oil for seizures when I was young instead of the potent drugs they had me on. They were approved however I had to be monitored by a psychologist.
790 2018-05-31 22:32:28 .@AxisOfAndrea has been highly critical of Rep. @trujillo_carl for taking money from the oil and gas industry.
791 2018-05-31 22:32:27 sigh. ima buy you beard oil so you can flourish. & I do. but I dont use them against you 
792 2018-05-31 22:32:23 The same also applies for Oil and Gas transactions
793 2018-05-31 22:32:03 @BretBaier Great report on oil market and gas prices! Confusing market given USA recent climb to oil independence. I guess it just takes time, THANKS! #SpecialReport
794 2018-05-31 22:31:38 In the article it is suggested that China wants oil sands mined by Chinese state-owned enterprises. Currently these companies (Sinopec, Nexen, CNOOC and to some extent Japan Canada) control less than 10% of production. Not enough to sway the market.
795 2018-05-31 22:31:34 I hate the taste of strong olive oil. It ruins everything :(
796 2018-05-31 22:31:33 i use the olive oil one. a lot of people says he doesn't slick theirs down either,  but it does mine 
797 2018-05-31 22:31:19 Heard tha trump will be discussing the US strategic oil reserves with Bart Simpson tomorrow.   

Another photo of trump with a porn star.  What gives?!?!
798 2018-05-31 22:31:19 Come get a job in west Texas! We love it in the oil industry
799 2018-05-31 22:31:04 I don't need you to thanks. And don't bang on about the oil and gas- like you own it either. Mind, I'm sure the extra tax on Buckfast will soon propel you to the top of the G8 table.

802 2018-05-31 22:30:41 The price of gas goes up every weekend and every other time that the oil companies know that there will be a lot of traveling.

805 2018-05-31 22:30:19 Take my property and you are the one not abiding by a law.  it makes you a thief. And I would take immediate recourse.
806 2018-05-31 22:30:16 I, too, used to be against drilling in the gulf because I cherished our beautiful beaches much.  Until 9-11.  Then I realized that being free from mid-east oil was much more important.
807 2018-05-31 22:30:16 To make up for the English half inching their oil money over the last thirty years probably.
808 2018-05-31 22:30:16 I’ve had two cancer diagnosis in past three years cbd oil is my new friend ...my pain has significantly reduced

810 2018-05-31 22:30:05 @OVERKILL_TM 
Can you guys update big oil so gaurds dont get alerted at the lab door being open please, that be much appreciated.
811 2018-05-31 22:29:56 Let people choose. What's wrong with people making their own choice in the matter? You can shout them down not to take snake oil, but in the end, let them decide, yeah?
812 2018-05-31 22:29:51 The £ will do for a transitional period and then our own Scottish Pound. It's not a problem hundreds of countries manage it quite easily. What currency will you buy our oil & food with?
813 2018-05-31 22:29:29 I strongly suspect that this buy out could be illegal as becoming a pipeline owner puts our government in a serious conflict of interest position when regulating other oil and pipeline companies.
814 2018-05-31 22:29:28 I don’t have time to educate you on chemistry and physics. As for the hashtag about where we should keep that oil, you know it literally seeps out of the ground into local water supplies by itself, right?
815 2018-05-31 22:29:20 Granted I was a wee one but the best scam I ever saw in my life was the cat with the three card monty cart at the end of the line at the gas station during the real oil crisis in the '70s $5 $10 or $20 and he went POOF! With the cash of course! Quit bitching about gas prices! 
816 2018-05-31 22:29:18 LFC European cups - 5

Oil money can't buy you everything.
817 2018-05-31 22:29:16 Actually, I prefer to think it’s because every election, every time, only a fraction of people get out and vote, and then vote with such startling lack of thought the clear choice got swamped out by social media marketers and snake oil salesmanship.
818 2018-05-31 22:29:08 Thanks for this.
She'll definitely be contacting support. The abuse is only getting worse and theyre now bragging theyre making her pay $75 for a 29 dollar bottle of hair oil. Outright disgusting
819 2018-05-31 22:28:49 Economic interests of big oil? You must mean the corporate big wigs and senior execs, correct?
820 2018-05-31 22:28:43 This is NOT Trump's plan. Best I can tell, he is a zero sum trader,pal's w Putin who wants oil prices as high as possible, and won't confront China IP theft. ZTE the WORST of offenders- stole everything from CISCO/Jupiter plus spying. Out of TPP, NAFTA. Want EU/euro to collapse.

826 2018-05-31 22:27:43 Hate getting oil changes cuz my shit synthetic, I wanna pay $20 like everybody else 
827 2018-05-31 22:27:42 You can exfoliate your lips once a week by using sugar and olive oil.
828 2018-05-31 22:27:40 Y’all make ground beef with veggie oil or water?
829 2018-05-31 22:27:30 Today a woman brought in a big envolope and said hey I found this picture of my passed husband when we worked at National Geographic, can I get it framed? 
And if was him makeing the silliest face with a helmet made of a globe, drafting materials and an oil can in a forest
830 2018-05-31 22:27:16 Yeh - but if you know that, so do the Saudis. They will manage their price to emasculate US oil production. In the meantime renewables will become the cheapest form of energy. A lot of US oil reserves will never be pumped.
831 2018-05-31 22:27:04 My smartass boyfriend thinks it takes hours to get your oil change and that you need an appointment. He told me “good luck” when I said I was going now.
832 2018-05-31 22:26:52 FACT- the body needs certain good "fats" daily such as olive oil, flaxseed, sunflower and canola. A couple teaspoons is okay.

846 2018-05-31 22:24:41 As gas prices keep rising just remember that the state of Texas only taxes you a “measly” $0.20 per gallon but only after the feds tax you $0.18 per gallon. All the while these greedy oil corporations have the gall to profit an average of $0.07 a gallon.

862 2018-05-31 22:22:08 They are reheating the blade

864 2018-05-31 22:21:53 No. The other uses... the oil... is the true reason for increased soy production
865 2018-05-31 22:21:45 Everyday Obama's doing is getting undoing, pretty soon he will go down in American history as just a nobody president who used allot of clove oil to make himself cry so Americans thinks he really cares about us while his wife hates this country and still does.
866 2018-05-31 22:21:36 The BP oil spill was a cover up by Big Chicken who were testing mass deep frying. dont believe me? Drink the oil and you can taste a hint of Colonel Sanders 12 spices and flavors

You are trying to bullshit people on here who are more politically aware since 2014.
872 2018-05-31 22:20:29 You are absolutely right and plus this will also help the Petro yuan rise faster in the oil trade.
873 2018-05-31 22:20:24 It's crucial when you note are uses of the oil.... the reason soy is grown... have increased proportionately. In other words each individual person (on average) is eating less meat but using more oil. The meat industry does not need soy but the soy oil industry does
874 2018-05-31 22:20:15 castor oil is good for stimulating hair growth!
875 2018-05-31 22:20:06 The oil that was used to anoint Jesus’ feet was commonly done, it wasn’t the anointing of the sick.  It was a gesture.
876 2018-05-31 22:20:00 Bro, coconut flavored everything sucks ass. I love coconut oil on my skin and hair that’s allllllll
877 2018-05-31 22:19:44 It’s so important to have good olive oil for salads
878 2018-05-31 22:19:42 Judging by the current polls, country is realizing nice hair and socks leads to a complete failure as a leader! Less than one term and he has screwed the oil sector, can’t secure borders, can’t close nafta,foreign investment fleeing, more taxes, ISIS reintegration camps! Brutal!
879 2018-05-31 22:19:41 We are Beavertown Gamma Tay and Neck Oil 
880 2018-05-31 22:19:39 Because it is lengthy it has to start now... and there is no 'destruction' proposed by slowing oil sands growth...
881 2018-05-31 22:19:25 I have been taking the CBD oil now for 2 months and it has added another layer of help. So do you take the kind with the THC in it? And do you think that helps also or do you rely mainly on the CBD oil
882 2018-05-31 22:19:23 it's horrible. I'm very sorry for him. Maybe it's better to postpone the concerts in Mexico? and 2 more in a row! God.. it is impossible to look without compassion. more oil is added to the fire by these so-called fans, there is no pity, the main thing is that they are greeted 
883 2018-05-31 22:19:14 Wasn't that just the coolant or oil leaking? 
884 2018-05-31 22:19:10 No OIL, No LIFE!!!
885 2018-05-31 22:18:40 Lamp oil, rope, bombs? You want it? It's yours, my friend, as long as you have enough rubies.
886 2018-05-31 22:18:35 They're supposed to be protected under federal law, but there are private interests that want to use the public lands the horses live on for things like ranching, gas, and oil. They view the horses as livestock and want them removed.
887 2018-05-31 22:18:31 @toto99com's @africabytotobot playing at @DeltaSonicWash in West Seneca while getting an oil change and tire rotation just as the big storm descends on WNY
888 2018-05-31 22:18:08 @ddale8 Wait until @JustinTrudeau decides to push up the price of tar-sand oil.
889 2018-05-31 22:18:06 Oil prices  : gas prices  in 24 hrs
Oil prices  : gas prices  in 3 months

Why? Oligopoly among refiners...

890 2018-05-31 22:17:53 Put some butter or coconut oil on it....  easy peasy
891 2018-05-31 22:17:52 I need to learn how to do my own damn oil change for my car ._.
892 2018-05-31 22:17:50 Not good, It opens the door for drug companies to sell snake oil to dieing people, at high prices that insurance won't pay for.
893 2018-05-31 22:17:48 We have the 2013 model, only tire rotations, and oil changes nearly 40 thousand miles all city driving. I am sure it will need brakes one of these days. Dealer maintained.
894 2018-05-31 22:17:41 Keep pumping that oil and eating pizza captain red beard 
895 2018-05-31 22:17:25 I would not have nationalized the Venezuelan oil industry or enacted price controls. I also would not have caused the mega inflation by printing money without sufficient economic growth. I would have made sure that tax policy was equitable and trade policy was encouraged
896 2018-05-31 22:17:11 あー、いつものところで入れたらそんくらいかかるんだ(;ﾟ∀ﾟ)　我輩のアジト近くはUny Oilを除けば軒並み147円なのでレガシィお腹いっぱいにしたらﾋｨｰ(((ﾟДﾟ)))ｶﾞﾀｶﾞﾀ　しかしアウトソーシングの企業は交通費ケチるよね(´Д｀)

900 2018-05-31 22:16:49 Same oil running out rubbish, quotes from Murdo and no mention of Brexit forecast. Aye good yin big pictures for the Sun readers, jog on....
901 2018-05-31 22:16:46 Shall we stop send our oil?
902 2018-05-31 22:16:43 Peace and sweet oil, orine glasses are still alive. We belong to Segun. The garden is all over... this is the translation.. just fyi
903 2018-05-31 22:16:28 More pipe dream speculation. Oil shale in US, new Gas and Oil discoveries all over the world at present will push Oil price to the floor ; you'll be f***ed
904 2018-05-31 22:16:26 The Scots know separation is finished now that oil won't fund it.
End of. Separation talk is now pure BS & only fools would fall for it.

906 2018-05-31 22:16:13 They just want to steal the land and punish people for fighting the oil companies.
907 2018-05-31 22:16:04 Mail me the coconut oil if it’s unrefined and virgin 
908 2018-05-31 22:15:46 I believe Donald arranged & directed his Russian-influenced election & was proud of his hero Putin’s support! Why did Trump abruptly leave campaign for “Ribbon cutting” in Scotland during Brexit vote? Who did he meet there? DT is a Putin wannabe with eyes on oil & riches.
909 2018-05-31 22:15:46 being at one with nature is like a bottle of oil measuring a tarot card
910 2018-05-31 22:15:16 Today Madison went on lockdown, seniors started fires, put baby oil and powder all down the stairs and in admins office, and egged every teachers room even egged the NEWS CREW that came out! FOUL AF

912 2018-05-31 22:14:57 @_marissaregina Happens to the best of us! Did you get the oil changed yet?
913 2018-05-31 22:14:56 i don’t wanna go get an oil change because that means that i have to chill at walmart for an hour and a half
914 2018-05-31 22:14:53 I'm skeptical too, but this doctor focuses on things that can be backed up by science (nerve stim and circulation) versus woo-woo and snake oil, which I like. It's a good supplement to my current regimen and will hopefully prevent needing more.
915 2018-05-31 22:14:42 what if oil me up scooby
916 2018-05-31 22:14:36 the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill animal welfare laws has caught a part of but youll never take our free time!

918 2018-05-31 22:14:21 Can they add oil companies to their list please!
919 2018-05-31 22:14:19 As a Canadian in a town that produces steel, "national security" rings hollow.  We also produce oil and potash - if we started shipping to China, gas might go to $5/gallon and ag inputs increase 30%.  Long term trust in USA markets doesn't come back easily, even with new leaders.
920 2018-05-31 22:14:15 Oil chaaaaange. 
921 2018-05-31 22:14:05 Or how about the fact that you guys have to by hydro and oil off of us since you don't have enough provide to your own people.   
*$20 says you will reply with a meme that have no factual backing...
922 2018-05-31 22:14:04 How does @Jeep think it’s ok my 2017 Cherokee burns quart of oil every 1000 miles. Not sure how that’s acceptable on a brand new car. Only fix is to replace motor. Really upset I even have to deal with this.
923 2018-05-31 22:13:59 And there we have it.
The real and only reason WM cant afford to lose Scotland.
OIL!!
924 2018-05-31 22:13:50 @MetroNissanRed your new staff sucks. It’s doesn’t take 2 hours for an oil change !
925 2018-05-31 22:13:42 Trying to figure out how no one in this house has lotion, Vaseline or coconut oil 
926 2018-05-31 22:13:22 imagine nerri having to be covered in coconut oil .......so mad
927 2018-05-31 22:13:22 Great job this week, everyone. We've all been experts on oil pipelines, international trade, network television morals, free speech, royal visit protocol, and it's only Thursday. Tomorrow is nuclear physics, then we can enjoy our weekends and start fresh Monday.
928 2018-05-31 22:13:20 #bbcqt the panel should discuss the fact that most English people would welcome Scotland going independent. We would welcome equality  (Barnet formula) and now that the North Sea oil will not fund NICOLA sturgeon’s reforms, how do she think they will have a successful economy?
929 2018-05-31 22:13:11 (2/3) to your home. However, it does mean that the electricity being poured into the grid on your behalf comes from pollution-free and renewable sources, rather than dirtier generation sources like coal and oil.

936 2018-05-31 22:12:38 Where did u spend all the money you collect as tax, not in education, health & transport and gadgari continue to sell roads to netas contract for toll gate, cant you manage the road after all the taxes gst, road tax, oil price u collect, pls be sensitive
937 2018-05-31 22:12:35 what, that I shouldn't use oil because I don't support alberta's socialist experiment in tarsands development? because I don't think the least efficient and dirtiest form of oil extraction is a good idea? and I'm the dipsit eh? sure thing dave. bahaha indeed
938 2018-05-31 22:12:30 saw you on BBG tv the other nite.  you did a great job!  think you were talking oil
939 2018-05-31 22:12:21 Most conservative climate denier politicians/business leaders have deep ties to extractive industries (oil, gas, mining) and thus to Russia, which *wants* global warming so it can access minerals in the Arctic.
940 2018-05-31 22:12:02 It may be harder to resist a Totalitarian State which relies on free milk and birth control clinics than one which relies on castor oil and concentration camps.
941 2018-05-31 22:12:00 Dont want to be a bioturd only trader..had some wins in oil 
. But fangs are not coming in
942 2018-05-31 22:11:57 أوروبا من شرقها لغربها ممله جدا '' 'هي فقط باريس وبرشلونه اللي فيها حياة وعالم' ''
943 2018-05-31 22:11:51 Canada can be self sufficient if we want to be. People forget that Canada is the richest in all resources. We could create so many jobs just by manufacturing all our own goods. Plenty of water, farmland, oil, forestry, cattle etc.
944 2018-05-31 22:11:50 So ... you decide to incite a Trade War with your neighbor, closest ally and largest trading partner - Canada? You underestimate how much food, oil and other natural resources you rely on us for.
945 2018-05-31 22:11:50 Definition of a bully? Trump. Trade war he wants guess a trade war he will get ...  Thinking if they can break agreements with nafta any time they feel like it perhaps it's time for a nice big increase in oil prices to them...
946 2018-05-31 22:11:46 Aku pake yang Evening Primrose Oil sama Tea Tree Oil
947 2018-05-31 22:11:43 Drunk Elephant is good too! if you like that brand maybe try their hydrating serum instead of the face oil. the oil will hydrate but it won’t help balance out your skin with your oil production
948 2018-05-31 22:11:43 I need to take out $150n go buy all natural products, soap, oil, n Shea butter 
949 2018-05-31 22:11:40 I think a better title for this article may have been "There are better oils for cooking than olive oil." Or "Here's a list of cooking oils that are better than olive oil."
950 2018-05-31 22:11:34 I just found a nice lil car shop to get an oil change at. Homeboy vacuumed out the air filter and didn’t even try to sell me extra shit 
951 2018-05-31 22:11:33 Ouuuh I've never thought of castor oil , def gonna try it out ! Ty !
952 2018-05-31 22:11:27 What's this Britain? Guess he means England so he reckons England isn't going to let Scotland have it's own oil and gas.
953 2018-05-31 22:11:19 This strikes me as just more scapegoating. "Yes, we can fly because big, bad oil companies!"
Bob Socolow as said that at this stage of the emissions reduction game "What's fair is no longer safe, and what's safe is no longer fair." People are either going to need take on 1/2

955 2018-05-31 22:11:06 The fact is the oilsands product is already brought to port by railcar and will continue to be. We are replacing railcar with pipeline. Truth is Alaska oil runs down your coastline already.  All day everday.  I feel for your arguments but the truth is the oil runs thru BC already
956 2018-05-31 22:10:59 Fine, no Canadian oil and gas for you.
957 2018-05-31 22:10:53 When Scotland is independent,those resources are in Scottish Waters.
Are you trying to tell me if oil was suddenly found off the cornish coast then scotland could get a share of that revenue also.
Face it mate your country is parasitic,it feeds of smaller nations
958 2018-05-31 22:10:53 And ignoring the anti-Semitic/Protocols bilge, this teenage Trotskyist idea that the US policy is determined by need for oil gets stronger despite the fact that, each year, US imports an ever smaller percentage of its energy.
959 2018-05-31 22:10:51 Oil would account for about 15% of the economy, a smaller %age than Norway BTW. You really do need to do some more research.
960 2018-05-31 22:10:50 @TaShawnaBolen and I thought it was a good idea to use tanning oil instead of sunscreen at the water park today and we look like lobsters 
961 2018-05-31 22:10:41 You are opposing the fact that Oil revenue is being used to finance FreeSHS? Are you okay?
962 2018-05-31 22:10:28 Canada only needs to account for their own emissions under Paris agreement, like every Country that has signed up. If the oil is exported to China then Chinese will burn it and account for the emissions.
963 2018-05-31 22:10:24 You can also put coconut oil in your hair, that pretty much brought mine back to life  also clay and coconut oil are pretty affordable (well, in my country)
964 2018-05-31 22:10:21 え…エルザとは…別に…な…(ﾀﾞｯ
965 2018-05-31 22:10:19 I hate coming to get oil changes by myself 
966 2018-05-31 22:10:18 Nails done & oil changed on my Chevy  best feeling ever
967 2018-05-31 22:10:12 Yo wtf ever happened to romphims , I was rocking them shits last summer in the oil fields
968 2018-05-31 22:10:06 迷うなあサラダ油なの？ごま油なの？どっちが好きなの？
969 2018-05-31 22:09:58 yeah , i use that & coconut oil
970 2018-05-31 22:09:52 Forget all that. Scotland's future economic prosperity is almost entirely based on Oil revenue
971 2018-05-31 22:09:52 Waiting to get a oil change is sooooo annoying because honestly how long does it take to just pour some oil back in there 
972 2018-05-31 22:09:45 Well crude oil is
973 2018-05-31 22:09:40 tried using baby oil to remove my tan today but realised half way through applying the oil i didn’t have one of those exfoliating mits...so used a washing up scourer instead 
974 2018-05-31 22:09:33 関節置換術において非細菌性の骨融解というか有害事象というかそういうのを引き起こすものにpolyethylene (PE) debrisがあってSeveral studies indicated that PE can be visualised in paraffin-embedded tissue sections not only by polarised light, but also after oil red stainingがあるのか
975 2018-05-31 22:09:30 SOS everything in my suitcase smells like tea tree oil 
976 2018-05-31 22:09:19 I gotta put oil in my car and I don’t even know how 
977 2018-05-31 22:09:09 We can only ship to the states. The states knows that so we sell our oil at a reduced rate to them. They sell it back at a higher price.
978 2018-05-31 22:09:04 Honestly seeing what people go through with cars dealing with oil changes, tire issues, batteries or engines or whatever, and it does not motivate me to get a license or car at all. It makes me want to use public transportation, Uber/lyft, or hire a personal driver.
979 2018-05-31 22:09:01 if anybody is wondering putting lavender oil on sunburns is a good natural remedy
980 2018-05-31 22:08:37 For youthful skin, mix 1 cup brown sugar, 1/8 cup olive oil, 1/8 cup oatmeal, 1/4 cup mashed figs, 1 oz vanilla. Leave on 20 mins.
981 2018-05-31 22:08:32 I cut way back on caffeine, started taking a fish oil supplement, and use salt sparingly
982 2018-05-31 22:08:32 You should check out which country sends you the most oil.
983 2018-05-31 22:08:25 Yeeeaaah but they are all very oil rich people there.. not like algeria, and he is right there is a problem with fatty homemade foods anyway 
984 2018-05-31 22:08:12 use coconut oil or castor oil on a lil wand and brush it through like 3x a week
985 2018-05-31 22:08:12 Before you ask what manner of deliciousness it is that I’m cooking, please first note whether or not it’s actually just my hand that has been bombarded with burning hot oil and released a (disturbingly) yummy smelling aroma...
986 2018-05-31 22:07:58 Thanks, I have F150, airbag light has been on for awhile. Never recd anything on it. Figured I’d have it checked out at next oil change. What does she drive?
987 2018-05-31 22:07:47 I hate waiting to get my oil changed
988 2018-05-31 22:07:40 You dey there your oil tanker dey collapse for the sea top
989 2018-05-31 22:07:32 Am that Oil, I dont mix up with water.
990 2018-05-31 22:07:14 You are old and withered
991 2018-05-31 22:07:09 Yeah Bondi Sands lotion in the blue bottle is really good, the oil in the brown bottle works too but smells worse 
992 2018-05-31 22:07:08 Many years ago before the offshore oil boom or Voisey Bay, Joey Smallwood could build new roads anywhere and everywhere in NL. These days Government can't fill a friggin pot hole. Where did the money come from back then?
993 2018-05-31 22:07:00 Jamie olive oil more like
994 2018-05-31 22:06:58 Dealerships have the best oil.
995 2018-05-31 22:06:53 You did nothing for the Gulf back when BP oil trashed the area.
996 2018-05-31 22:06:40 Is Statoil rebranding as Equinor because people mistake Statoil as Russian? Or because state owned oil firms are struggling? What an unimaginative rebrand from a name meaning state owned oil company to a name aspirationally aiming for equal distribution between oil and wind.
997 2018-05-31 22:06:22 Argon oil is >>>
998 2018-05-31 22:06:16 To plump up lips, apply peppermint oil.
999 2018-05-31 22:06:12 Flavor your oil
1000 2018-05-31 22:06:12 try castor oil! It’s worked for mine
1001 2018-05-31 22:05:34 Well, at least your stupidity is unique... we ant NOKO's rare minerals?!? Why not their gas and oil? I guess we should be glad that NOKO had no idea they had rare minerals we could steal... SAFI... but Trump will fix that too...
1002 2018-05-31 22:05:33 what a ridiculous comment...a pumping station leaked less than two automobile gas tanks worth of oil...which was immediately contained on the property. This is the stuff that you embarrass yourself by retweeting @ElizabethMay
1003 2018-05-31 22:05:33 We're undermining the Venezuelan government and we pulled out of the Iran agreement. Not that they've affected world oil prices, but they make good *excuses* for the refiners....

"Oh those oil price changes won't affect gas prices for months!"
1004 2018-05-31 22:05:30 You forgot to say we canceled Iran nuclear deal, and have started buying oil and gas from Russia.....Hmmmm!
1005 2018-05-31 22:05:28 Stop lying.  In order for American companies to cut a profit they must have HIGH oil prices which harm the consumer.
1006 2018-05-31 22:05:21 That fruit and spinach salad with sunflower seed oil and fig vinegar was BOMB
1007 2018-05-31 22:05:19 Sorry Kwasi. Economists are blaming the following for slow growth in Scotland. 

BREXIT -  reserved to the UK 
Population - reserved to the UK
Oil & Gas investment - reserved to the UK

1010 2018-05-31 22:05:08 Thing is,after last weeks concern down south that they will have vastly reduced water supplies by 2030. They only need to look North with envy.Scotland has more fresh water that England & Wales combined. It will become more valuable than any oil revenues
1011 2018-05-31 22:05:00 Had one of 20 years ago, burnt a lot of oil, dodgy electrics but loved it.
1012 2018-05-31 22:04:56 Can we put regulations on pipelines and any water & oil goals + the movement through Canada to get to Alaska. Our population =‘s that of one state. They want our resources. Tariff that!
1013 2018-05-31 22:04:30 I wish I was alive with dinosaur because then I would be fossil oil by this time and I could be the fucking tar and get stepped on uwu I hate myself
1014 2018-05-31 22:04:29 My car was running like garbage, and I had no idea why. Then I realized I was 5000 miles overdue for an oil change Wonder Skittle is running so much better now lmfao
1015 2018-05-31 22:04:26 Oil change  
Now I gotta get new tires

1018 2018-05-31 22:04:09 Hahaha that’s your head not mine mate. The oil jug is definitely for the kitchen..
1019 2018-05-31 22:03:28 I agree, many oil car trains cross from Canada into the US over the Rainier train bridge. The cars carry oil from both the Alberta oil sands and the Bakkan oil field in North Dakota. I also hope we never have a spill.
1020 2018-05-31 22:03:27 Ah money is the oil that oils the cogs,that lubricate the bank accounts,that turn the drills, that proďuce the billions that comforts the ,people who produce the oil,that the billionaires pay the government of the people to go to war so we the people pay for it all. R we stupid ?
1021 2018-05-31 22:03:24 You are competing against Lorenzo's Oil......
1022 2018-05-31 22:03:17 Made homemade French fries. No oil/butter. Gwen is chowing down 
1023 2018-05-31 22:03:12 Wow, I think they need to use your oil brush set and go paint some happy little clouds.
1024 2018-05-31 22:02:56 Tar sands are in California. I think you mean oil sands. Also, do you think the carbon footprint is more or less if we move petroleum products via rail or trucks?
1025 2018-05-31 22:02:50 A snake oil salesman by any other name is still a revolting individual
1026 2018-05-31 22:02:45 We could always just turn the taps off our oil being sent to the states.
Sincerely, Rachel Notley
1027 2018-05-31 22:02:44 Cracked oil pan in the Tahoe. Always something. Right before we have to goto Delaware

1030 2018-05-31 22:02:18 the end of oil does not threaten much of real freedom.  what it threatens is a mindless consumerism.  in the future, manufacturing may become more local, quality may come back when shipping junk merchandise gets too expensive. Clothes may become more practical, food more local
1031 2018-05-31 22:02:03 Clay for pimples and coconut oil for moisturizing, the best things that happened to me 
1032 2018-05-31 22:01:59 Asking ya girl "did you eat today?", is so passé. It's 2018, we asking if you took ya fish oil today
1033 2018-05-31 22:01:43 The A82 reflects lack of investment in Scotland and its infrastructure over the last 50 years.   Remind me again...where did the oil money go?   M25?
1034 2018-05-31 22:01:16 Several private companies still invested in Canada's oil sands and several still own pipelines.
1035 2018-05-31 22:00:59 While making dinner/dessert, Keven and I just used a shot glass to measure tablespoons and cups of oil for brownies... #goteam
1036 2018-05-31 22:00:46 Are you taking up a roll with the federal government's new in-house oil pipeline lobbying department?

1042 2018-05-31 22:00:02 Here's the problem with your logic.. the world doesnt evolve around you.  There IS  fair trade with Canada.   Do you really want to start a trade war?  Do you even know who is your number one supplier of oil is??  Give you a hint... when you get to Detroit.. turn right.
1043 2018-05-31 22:00:00 There was no more oil in the house, nor were there any candles.（家にはもう油がなく、ろうそくもありませんでした。）
1044 2018-05-31 22:00:00 Your car needs more maintenance than a regular oil change. Read up on the car's manual to make sure you're taking proper care of your vehicle.

1049 2018-05-31 21:59:42 Baby oil. No joke the stuff works like magic. But be careful not to burn
1050 2018-05-31 21:59:35 convinced the kids i nanny that i had pee for salad dressing. it was just lemon juice and olive oil 
1051 2018-05-31 21:59:19 Yeah I heard about becoming an oil baron but the rest is news to me - thank you for the great summation. I am so happy @arianek treatment was approved! Yay.
1052 2018-05-31 21:59:17 bathed myself in coconut oil and now im happy 
1053 2018-05-31 21:59:12 Hey bby  @brokkenwingx
1054 2018-05-31 21:59:03 EZ shares -1%, US shares -0.7% as US to impose steel & al tariffs delayed from earlier this yr on EU, Can & Mexico.

1055 2018-05-31 21:59:02 Hmm... It's going to have to. It freedom is water Trudeau is oil... They won't mix.
1056 2018-05-31 21:59:00 Also i know your office is quite lower than that of the minister of petroleum. Can you explain the dynamics behind crude oil price and price of PMS in the country? Thanks and more grease to your elbow
1057 2018-05-31 21:58:46 getting an oil change and some lady walks up to the desk next to me and starts talking I was like she sounds familiar. turns out to be my cousin I haven’t seen since I was like 7. real stories of having a massive family
1058 2018-05-31 21:58:38 Whats with the concern....Scotland is subsidised remember...why not just let us go.
WM isnt keeping Scotland for its sense of humour.
Could it be the £1.5 trillion in untapped oil off Scotland's West Coast.or more importantly,Scotlands vast fresh water supply.
1059 2018-05-31 21:58:32 Lol get a oil pen nice n light. Helps for Headaches Sore Mucles n Stomach Cramps 
1060 2018-05-31 21:58:18 Gel wrappers are thrown in a specific green zone. Bidons are compostable/biodegradable as made from corn based plastic rather than oil based plastic.
1061 2018-05-31 21:58:00 In response to BC CTV news
report on Caribous - their

  - Winter is cold, much much
    colder in wilderness.
It would be nice, if all of us 
can find shelters before Winter
time, when- wind,rains, snow
and storms can be devastating.
Peace!
1062 2018-05-31 21:57:49 I know for sure that SHE spilt oil on the kitchen floor and that fucker is now an ice rink 
1063 2018-05-31 21:57:44 I’m just tryna schedule a oil change appt and Toyota is playing
1064 2018-05-31 21:57:41 Ayeee! Im sorry my dear. Hope u good.
1065 2018-05-31 21:57:33 LOL - yeah, I know. I know I’m in the minority, but a bunch of testosterone-filled, roided-out dudes, wearing very little clothing and lots of baby oil, fake fighting, is not my thing.
1066 2018-05-31 21:57:31 Do you think the Government will drag it’s feet on the problem with the steel production Like it has with the Oil sector in Alberta and Saskatchewan seeing the majority of jobs affected are in BC,ONT,and Quebec. I think not @WBrettWilson
1067 2018-05-31 21:57:26 They about to drop beard oil on that kd fan club owner in the faded Sonics shirt.
1068 2018-05-31 21:57:15 Coconut oil? Never heard of that one! Which stuff would you use?
1069 2018-05-31 21:57:09 Attraction oil

1071 2018-05-31 21:56:38 Rubbish 

The only reason Nikki “pathological liar” Haley is concerned about Sudan is because there’s oil in that country. 

Why has she turned a blind eye to the genocide of Muslim children in Myanmar? 

#Naive
1072 2018-05-31 21:56:22 Lol coconut oil saved my life 
1073 2018-05-31 21:56:20 Totally- same thing here. My French recipe for tomato salad might just work. Slice beef tomatoes, salt lightly, drizzle with a dressing of balsamic vinegar and olive oil, leave at ‘room temperature’ for a couple of hours. Delicious. Works in France, here I put it in bread warmer
1074 2018-05-31 21:56:19 There is very little oil production in Pennsylvania. There are plenty of NGL's or light barrels, but no material crude production from the Marcellus.
1075 2018-05-31 21:56:07 (2/4) He was at the time dating Miss India USA (beautiful, brilliant and comfortable with her gifts--HATED Battle for pulling her). We all know dipping is acceptable in LE/Mil/Oil Field settings, repulsive everywhere else.
1076 2018-05-31 21:56:00 Very morbid lol
Imagine someone sending you those unoskwera waakuchurch uchidhudhudza holy water nekuzvizadza anointing oil shem

Pretty but no thenk yew
1077 2018-05-31 21:55:57 Geezus - How much are the oil kings of Alberta paying @JustinTrudeau 's Liberals for him to buy this wreck that isn't wanted?
1078 2018-05-31 21:55:50 Those ways are all blind alleys: like refraining from milk in the name of rosy future of the planet, refraining from sex in the name of demographics, refraining from oil in the name of climate etc. Technological & scientific progress is the solution: "artificial" meat & milk
1079 2018-05-31 21:55:31 At first I was scared bc my face was dry and the soap is supposed to make it drier, so that’s why I just put on the bare oil. Now I only break out when I’m stressed or when I pluck my facial hair. And I don’t go on any diets, I eat all the food I want, and the same goes w water
1080 2018-05-31 21:55:16 I’ve never bought avocado oil.. I’ve always roasted my vegetables with olive oil..I will have to look for it at the grocery store next time I go...
1081 2018-05-31 21:55:14 Best part..
I got the baby oil whos butt is feelin rough, feelin rough

Motha fucka shut up
1082 2018-05-31 21:55:02 Mann oil change dont need to cost that much!

1084 2018-05-31 21:54:42 Lots Of Oil..
1085 2018-05-31 21:54:04 We need to take oil off the exchange
1086 2018-05-31 21:53:52 Ghana chased away Chinese who were polluting their rivers with oil and other toxic substances from mining sites in Zim even if they can roast human beings on site someone will be bouncing his chest
1087 2018-05-31 21:53:51 You know how I know you know you are bullshitting?  That new 1,200 watts you are bragging about cost you much less than your initial install.
1088 2018-05-31 21:53:29 Oil Money gang
1089 2018-05-31 21:53:24 Just a friendly reminder that 41% of the oil used everyday to power the US economy comes from Canada.

41%.
1090 2018-05-31 21:53:16 The food system is an obvious weak point.  You need the oil industry and the truck builders and mechanics to take the crop to market.  tractors to produce it.  without frozen and refrigerated, a lot of stuff goes by the way.  So you will probably see bandages and such, dry goods.
1091 2018-05-31 21:53:11 No le pongas gas oil a la leña  puto jajajjajaa
1092 2018-05-31 21:53:11 Pür's Big Look with Argan Oil! It's amaaaazing. It goes on really smooth, layers well & it makes my eyelashes look super long

1094 2018-05-31 21:52:52 I know nothing about volcanic activity but does any of this have to do with the fracking from drilling for oil just wondering
1095 2018-05-31 21:52:52 those who invaded Nicaragua, Iraq & Afghanistan for selfish purposes (oil & to grow the new world order) They’ve also staged coups in many countries over the last few decades; the right wing US military & allies. We invade, ruin and then turn people against us- WE create enemies.
1096 2018-05-31 21:52:35 Coconut Oil Eco Styler is undefeated
1097 2018-05-31 21:52:35 I’ll do proper show links etc in the morning , but new show is up for those burning the midnight oil!
1098 2018-05-31 21:52:28 Money and friends are like water and oil.
1099 2018-05-31 21:52:03 Good. Don't want to waste that baby oil you've been stocking up.
1100 2018-05-31 21:51:56 Might want to use avocado oil if cooking at that temp, Olive oil isn't that great for high heat cooking, it's really not suitable for cooking in general. It oxidizes pretty easy.
1101 2018-05-31 21:51:54 Why did the oil monarch do after a socialist revolution hit Switzerland?
1102 2018-05-31 21:51:47 David Smick #SouthbridgeDebate Opening Statement: Owner of Red Star Oil focused on upcoming expenses and capital plans for Southbridge, "we can no longer place that tax burden on the backs of the taxpayers" — touts experience of himself and the "Experience Ticket"
1103 2018-05-31 21:51:40 What currency will Scotland use? The pound? The euro? No one knows. What share of North Sea oil revenues will go to Edinburgh? What about Scotland’s share of Britain’s enormous national debt?
1104 2018-05-31 21:51:27 Well, then we can impose higher tariffs on lumber. Or shut passages through our ocean. Or heck turn our oil & gas taps off. They depend on us too. I'm not worried.
1105 2018-05-31 21:51:21 Quiero dejar de mentirme diciendo que todo esta bien cuando se que nada esta bien
1106 2018-05-31 21:51:16 I never believed Ghana was that hard as talked about until I saw my friend eat bread with anointing oil

1107 2018-05-31 21:51:16 It potentially could be a spectacular & hilarious fall from grace. Oil means it won't happen but imagine if they turned attention to the Middle East next!
1108 2018-05-31 21:51:13 New power sourse may power cars soon. Water used to power the space shuttle may be used to power cars in the near future. More precisely the components hydrogen which contains more energy than oil is cleaner with only water vapour as an exhaust
1109 2018-05-31 21:51:11 Power washer works amazing :) clesned out the garage floor from oil amd stains pretty well

1114 2018-05-31 21:50:17 Ah yea that’s true, didn’t think about that. Doubt the oil price stays low anyway
1115 2018-05-31 21:50:07 fun fact time, the US produces more oil than anyone in the world.
1116 2018-05-31 21:49:32 If the Middle East ever runs out of oil they’re welcome to mine my fucking pores because they’re full of it hun x
1117 2018-05-31 21:49:27 Plus you have to remember this is a state that doesnt have leadership that believes in climate warming or much in science unless it supports gas or oil exploration.

1121 2018-05-31 21:48:56 Cannabis oil has made my life infinitely easier.  Not because I'm taking it, but because several critical people in my life who I occasionally want to murder have started.  Yay cannabis!!!
1122 2018-05-31 21:48:56 I'd love our economy to flourish,oil,the lot,it would bolster the UK economy, unfortunately the snp are happy as is.
Blame Westminster
1123 2018-05-31 21:48:47 i’m boiling in my own oil right now.
1124 2018-05-31 21:48:44 Latest Propaganda: Scott Pruitt, oil company lobbyist, now head of Environmental Protection Agcy, Sinclair Broadcasting at least 28 times on 18 different stations: Environment is cleaner than ever. Reality: thousands of miles of river water undrinkable, unusable from mining waste
1125 2018-05-31 21:48:44 Fish oil is not a banned substance, it is an impermissible substance, meaning the NCAA does not allow the schools to provide it to their athletes. They are free to purchase it on their own.
1126 2018-05-31 21:48:43 It'll be a disaster. Business will go running,  the EU wont have you with your near 9% budget deficit; you will not get the Oil deal you " dream of "; you'll have an even greater number of young professionals leaving , you'll be pursuing utopian politics,
1127 2018-05-31 21:48:36 Lol your club would be irrelevant and in the third division if it wasn’t for oil money.
1128 2018-05-31 21:48:19 Of all the weird shit on the internet, the hatred of mayo might be the weirdest. It's not like the ingredients are strange or something. It's just eggs and oil. And it's delicious. No sandwich is complete without it. What gives?
1129 2018-05-31 21:48:18 Sounds really fishy to me. Operating Optimum Density? I currently receive nerve block injections by-weekly along with manual lymphatic drainage from a CDT trained nurse. How the hell would light touch help my deep issues? I say Snake Oil Treatment.
1130 2018-05-31 21:48:12 You’re actually drinking generator oil willingly ? 
1131 2018-05-31 21:48:09 The facts are clear: @PepsiCo has been sourcing Conflict #PalmOil from PT SPS II –– a notoriously bad actor that has allowed the continued destruction of critical forests in the Tripa peatland. Does that seem in line with PepsiCo’s “sustainable” palm oil policy?
1132 2018-05-31 21:48:06 how do people consume these big fish oil capsules...how
1133 2018-05-31 21:47:40 You are aware that the US legislature is bicameral, right? Just because I just mentioned the appointment of senators doesn't mean the house suddenly disappeared.
1134 2018-05-31 21:47:09 We can turn the Scottish Oil tap off from Greedy London !
BY VOTING FOR INDEPENDENCE 
1135 2018-05-31 21:46:40 And yeahhh. Apparently coconut oil in your hair isn’t good bc it will bake yo shit sis LOL. People use that to cook so imagine that in your hair. If I put coconut oil in my hair I usually do it the night before
1136 2018-05-31 21:46:32 Rosehip oil + coconut oil = best skin routine ever
1137 2018-05-31 21:46:16 craving some of my dad french toast shit is oil man
1138 2018-05-31 21:46:03 天気めっちゃよい
1139 2018-05-31 21:45:55 Quit blowing yourself and reread the tweet you replied to.
1140 2018-05-31 21:45:47 Best thing happen is we r getting our OWN oil!  Get real Como!
1141 2018-05-31 21:45:32 Yep we've had way more back than the oil money sent but that's OK. Hopefully the Scottish economy can motor again at some point & our deficit will be eliminated. Seems unlikely any time soon unfortunately.
1142 2018-05-31 21:45:30 Fucking right on dude! I’m already two days without washing it, so I’m off to a good start. Gotta purchase the oil now. Thank you for the secret to great hair.
1143 2018-05-31 21:45:29 I had a dream that I paid $115 today for a oil change. When I woke up from my nap I checked my account and there it was. The $115 subtracted. Fmlll
1144 2018-05-31 21:45:07 That's the inherent problem with using the term Constitutional Republic exclusively. It only describes how the central powers look. It does not describe how representatives got there. The word Democratic, modifying the word Republic, does.
1145 2018-05-31 21:44:58 try a little olive oil to smooth the way
1146 2018-05-31 21:44:44 Lavender essential oil 
1147 2018-05-31 21:44:39 Probably for the same reason they don't pay tax in this country but like Shell get a rebate. Figure it out. Every country where BP and Shell extract oil they pay the respective governments for the privilege except the UK.
1148 2018-05-31 21:44:34 All I saw was leaves lmao garnished with red oil 
1149 2018-05-31 21:44:19 Stunning oil slick by Samantha Renee'.  Spruce up your doo with a little color at Avant.  #avantsalonspa #aveda #oilslickhair
1150 2018-05-31 21:43:47 Love this tweet. As a Canadian, I admit that it's pretty difficult to piss us off.  This definitely did the trick. But many of us are also quite pissed off at Trudeau for dumping $4.5B of our taxpayer $ into a Texas-based oil company to save a doomed pipeline expansion.

1152 2018-05-31 21:43:41 I didn't track anything when I started keto some years ago, but I was eating stupid amounts of butter, double cream, nut butters, coconut oil etc, and would have easily been consuming 2x my previous energy intake given >volume + >caloric density, and still lost body fat quickly.
1153 2018-05-31 21:43:41 Fair trade for his Russian oligarch masters.  Leaving the Iran deal was payment for the election by increasing the price of oil.
1154 2018-05-31 21:43:36 Rice bran sama vit e oil
1155 2018-05-31 21:43:34 And one more thing, I'm not sure what you mean by "jesus chose the form..."  Certainly he does, but I only challenge whether he ever "chose" that clergy be male. And he chose to allow a woman to anoint him with oil... why is that ritual now reserved for male clergy?
1156 2018-05-31 21:43:33 You'd have to go back to the Standard Oil era to find an analog.  The bankers could also act but it would require some event of distress or fiduciary breach.
1157 2018-05-31 21:43:30 Always quick to tell us GEJ Started it ... He used 5years with Oil boom.... So he couldn't START AND COMPLETE anything ?? Ara n ja yin je
1158 2018-05-31 21:43:28 Of course his base doesn’t care because they THINK it will effect only ACA enrollees. They are in for a big surprise. And the GOP/Trump snake oil sale of “free market” healthcare does not provide healthcare to those who saw premiums rise BEFORE ACA.
1159 2018-05-31 21:43:24 OH... I'm sorry... Intelligent people should know that as oil prices go up....Aviation fuel also goes up... Along with airplane ticket prices. Beer prices will increase a couple cents... And material in phones... Good excuse for raising prices. But blame Trump.
1160 2018-05-31 21:43:21 It also helps to not be wrong but...
You know.
1161 2018-05-31 21:43:20 I legit swear by baby oil
1162 2018-05-31 21:43:20 @Tesla Tesla does have its community support.  Use it.  Stick to the oil man or bust.
1163 2018-05-31 21:43:15 me: hey, i’m here for an oil change
mechanic: yeah i know, your mom just called me
1164 2018-05-31 21:43:12 Then you have to deal with zombie banks,and choose a method of currency backing based on an asset class not an ideology. For instance much of the US dollar in reality backed up by military strength and oil theft, not its presupposed original. Its a ponzy scheme.
1165 2018-05-31 21:43:05 To preserve olive oil with its healthy contents, store it in dark colored bottles away from light &amp; heat.
1166 2018-05-31 21:42:58 Not totally. But popular election of representatives is a wholly democratic method of selection, and thus affects the system as a whole. Democratic. Republic. Still a republic, but with democracy inherent to it.
1167 2018-05-31 21:42:57 “Almost all growth will be in Asian” is ignoring all of China’s efforts to get off oil. Within 12 years, all gasoline autos will be banned. Without auto $, oil prices will collapse. Article totally ignores this fact.

1170 2018-05-31 21:42:21 Nit sure they have refined the cheaper oil yet. What in most gas station tanks is high priced.
1171 2018-05-31 21:42:17 Ahh synthetic, I'm supposed to get synthetic mix when I do mine. I'll miss my cheapo conventional oil changes

1173 2018-05-31 21:42:07 Olive oil extract. Start immediately when you feel symptoms.
1174 2018-05-31 21:42:01 Fish scale. Oil based.
1175 2018-05-31 21:41:55 Well. US does get the majority of its oil imports from CN.
1176 2018-05-31 21:41:52 Pity free trade Trudeau Govt did‘t go equally berserk when the past President used the same obsolete “national security” argument to block the Keystone pipeline because, for one thing, it would be full of “foreign” oil.
1177 2018-05-31 21:41:46 Love your generosity but please clean up the ingredients.... ie sugar and hydrogenated oil  in your peanut butter so it is a healthy option.  Those ingredients contribute to disease!
1178 2018-05-31 21:41:37 How are your reps elected?
1179 2018-05-31 21:41:36 What are they powered on? Electricity or diesel?

Help us, Bobby Wan Kenobi, you're our only hope!

Oh, wait. VOTING is also our hope.
1188 2018-05-31 21:40:32 Then tell me why some of the players in the NFL can play the game but this one can't? I've always wanted to play the game but couldn't because seizures were so bad. CBD oil is legal.

1190 2018-05-31 21:40:23 Absolutely it does. The election of representatives is an integral part of the system. Just as amending the constitution such that senators were no longer appointed by the state legislatures changed the way government functioned.

1192 2018-05-31 21:40:08 Time Canada imposes steep tariffs on water lumber and oil. F**k Trump
1193 2018-05-31 21:40:03 We could always start selling oil in euros or pounds, instead of dollars...
#newsnight
1194 2018-05-31 21:39:58 We do not get oil from them.
1195 2018-05-31 21:39:48 our local health food stores carry CBD oil. that might help.
1196 2018-05-31 21:39:46 Oil prices are rising too high 
1197 2018-05-31 21:39:45 The VERY BEST SNAKE OIL SALESMAN in the business. Has a small mansion here in Kingwood. @JMW14FLASH hey Magic
1198 2018-05-31 21:39:38 I definitely do. The pipeline is unnecessary. Only proponents supporting a Texas based company believe BC's coastline is for sale. Years from now when the spill(s) have ruined what was once beautiful BC, people will ask, why another pipeline when oil is so seldom used?
1199 2018-05-31 21:39:37 For healthy shiny hair use a hot oil treatment once a week.
1200 2018-05-31 21:39:34 Bruce Lee once said that every time the orange man tries to formulate a clear sentence, more than one earthling dreams about being a #Democrat
1201 2018-05-31 21:39:34 Exactly ! Like for one he didn’t have to buy him anything he did it from his heart ! & I’m pretty sure that man is appreciative cause he was walking ! & if anything goes wrong with it he can afford it , tires are cheaper oil changes are cheaper & etc .
1202 2018-05-31 21:39:23 He takes $ from Oil and Gas companies and votes with the GOP A LOT at the Legislature - so that's no from a lot of us. Weird to have a GOP dude run a Dem race - ew.

1208 2018-05-31 21:38:46 oh ok!! and yea so if the batter was fine it's just tht coconut oil isnt as oily as many other oils are, probably due to a high water content, so it melts and evaporates easily. tbh when u put the dough down I recommend to flatten them a bit cus they don't spread n I Hate that sm
1209 2018-05-31 21:38:33 It's to slow. Boiled in oil
1210 2018-05-31 21:38:29 How are your reps elected?
1211 2018-05-31 21:38:20 They will never learn. These snake oil salesmen have been around since the beginning of time and there’s a sucker born every minute.

1214 2018-05-31 21:38:05 How are your reps elected?
1215 2018-05-31 21:38:05 Oh, and motor oil.
1216 2018-05-31 21:37:54 This dispute once again points to the need to diversify trade. Adding capacity to the Trans mountain pipeline and getting canadian oil to market is even more important and building the pipeline with canadian steel should be a priority.
1217 2018-05-31 21:37:48 It is a modifier. It is an adjective modifying the noun "republic." This is middle school level. You're regressing.
1218 2018-05-31 21:37:43 Awesome!  I use coconut oil myself, never thought to whip it!
1219 2018-05-31 21:37:38 I don’t see oil and gas on the list. Or detergents, shampoos, cleaners ... I’m sure they are shaking
1220 2018-05-31 21:37:36 Make a pizza! Use a base of sun-dried tomato oil and Monterey Jack, add black beans and bake. Top with kosher salt.
1221 2018-05-31 21:37:24 Things I bought that I never I needed: a massage oil candle. Smells amazing on skin and in the air, warm oil feels great and v moisturizing 10/10 recommend.
1222 2018-05-31 21:37:08 Compassionate Use has been available with FDA over site since the 70s.  This only adds the ability for people to be ripped off by Snake Oil Salesmen with no FDA safety net.  He is grandstanding and making things worse.
1223 2018-05-31 21:36:58 Doesn't Jerry #Colangelo have another son with more brains? I haven't seen this level of incompetence from a son since Jock Ewing gave Ewing Oil to Bobby instead of J.R. #ColangeloGate #Dallas

1225 2018-05-31 21:36:57 Go in for free oil change (coupons with newer car). Get a call. Turns out something chewed a wire of my steering column, and if that shorts, steering goes out. Not covered under warranty. Free turns into $65 turns into $87 real quick.

1227 2018-05-31 21:36:51 @andrewmclainwho We use so many products from other countries, they are highly dependent on us to buy them. Also I believe we are more capable of being self sufficient than most countries which puts us in a power position. Crude oil and cheap electronics don’t digest very well.
1228 2018-05-31 21:36:50 Men: do you shop for your own beauty products? Shampoo, hair oil, lotion, etc.?

1230 2018-05-31 21:36:38 I’m dead at my old strip club with 2 pieces of birthday cake in front of me and a Jameson and ginger smoking on some good oil. 

Why did I quit again?
1231 2018-05-31 21:36:33 Just dropped my lighter in a pan of old oil.. FUCK TODAY
1232 2018-05-31 21:36:28 Yeah definitely! The term hybrid and NASCAR seems like oil and water.

1237 2018-05-31 21:36:09 Good. We shouldn't buy food from Mexico, we grow better, we don't need any wine from the EU, and Canada, well maybe we need their timber, but maybe we can adapt and overcome. Drill our own oil, see how you all do.
1238 2018-05-31 21:36:03 They burn coal to power the extraction of the oil contaminate the water removing the sand add the worst chemicals to move it around and then after all that it's still worth less just the cleanup will cost more then we'd ever gain
1239 2018-05-31 21:36:00 You're a fucking oil painter. LOL! Get a job & get out of mommy's basement.

1261 2018-05-31 21:34:14 try mixing your tea tree oil with lavender oil.. this helps with the burning and the lavender oil helps with redness as well
1262 2018-05-31 21:34:08 What about %70 of your oil?
1263 2018-05-31 21:33:57 Where would that oil be? We get most of our oil from north and south America.
1264 2018-05-31 21:33:47 Oh that’s reminds me. I need argon, peppermint, and jojoba oil.
1265 2018-05-31 21:33:30 Sorry about your Dad's diagnosis. Research RSO, Rick Simpson Oil (cannabis oil). There are sympathetic providers out there. Best to you.
1266 2018-05-31 21:33:28 you have the right to remain stupid. anything you stay can be used against you in a quart of oil.
1267 2018-05-31 21:33:17 Allowing people to waste money on Snake Oil Cures is not going against Pharma. Taking away FDA oversite is foolish.  Compassionate Use has been available since the 70s through the FDA with 99%+ approval.  He is only Grandstanding and making this worse.
1268 2018-05-31 21:33:10 CBD oil & edibles have helped me immensely with my insomnia. It’s the good shit 
1269 2018-05-31 21:33:08 I buy a variety of food, all meant to appeal to the birds in my area, as well as to attract those that are less seen. So, lots of black oil sunflower seed, and blends that contain fruits and nuts. Lots of suet, and I vary those that I put out. Peanuts for the jays and crows. 1/2
1270 2018-05-31 21:33:05 Laced? It’s 92-96% pure high quality CBD oil, laced is a dumb word to describe it
1271 2018-05-31 21:33:04 Yup. That. Sump oil and squitter in one handy jar.

1280 2018-05-31 21:32:21 Dude. This is basic political science. Constitutional Republic desctibes 2 things. First, the fact that central powers are separated among 2 or more branches.
Second, that the system is a republic.
It says nothing of the practical selection method of reps in the system.

1282 2018-05-31 21:32:08 You have done shit to help. Your liberals made Ontario uncompetitive with hydro and labour laws, you are destroying oil/gas ... I don’t invest here. You are toothless against US. You played all your cards and it’s a bad hand.
1283 2018-05-31 21:32:06 If oil is made from decomposed dinosaurs, and plastic is made from oil, are plastic dinosaurs made from real dinosaurs? 
1284 2018-05-31 21:32:06 Have a view on rising oil prices? Should they be linked to the market prices or should the fuel surcharge/taxes be levied to sustain the development schemes? #LetsTalkPolicy
1285 2018-05-31 21:31:52 All the supporters from the abramovich era will now be city fans and when the Middle East oil goes those Man City fans will go back to supporting Man Utd
1286 2018-05-31 21:31:51 Pfff we should all go further on electric stuff than we do not need oil no more !
1287 2018-05-31 21:31:26 If your a “quick lube” and it takes you 2.5 hours to do a oil change, tire rotation and clear two codes you won’t keep a customer who isn’t retired with nothing to do.
1288 2018-05-31 21:31:17 The only thing it changes is that it allows you to go waste your money on Snake Oil Cures that are not over seen by the FDA.  Compassionate Use has been available since the 70s and had over 99% approval for people requesting unapproved drugs.

He is just Grandstanding!
1289 2018-05-31 21:31:15 Got my oil changed yesterday and today my engine check light on 
1290 2018-05-31 21:31:13 You think? Isn't it fishy that the biggest oil patch has barely and rafineries for us to use the oil but our gouvernement is spending $4.5 billion to ship it to China?
Thank you @JustinTrudeau @RachelNotley
1291 2018-05-31 21:31:02 Lol hell yeah that pride a mf, we Oil & water 
1292 2018-05-31 21:30:58 tbh they look like ones I've made before with coconut oil,, and oof it's some dry shit
1293 2018-05-31 21:30:57 Thank you.. I use 100% tea tree oil and African black soap.. i put the soap on my facial sponge and add a couple of drops of the oil on it & just rub it on my face
1294 2018-05-31 21:30:40 I def prefer oils! The one I have now is a fragrance oil blend. 

I'll be missing MCC this year, sadly, to make room for another trip I'm taking in August. It's a long road trip for me. (If you remember Scout Jim last year, that was me).

Good luck at MCC tho! I'll miss everyone.

1298 2018-05-31 21:30:17 they're green cus of the avocado,, and coconut oil cookies don't spread much. and because ur using a lot of liquids with a high viscosity the cookies spread less. with a less viscous liquid they'll spread more,, was the batter a bit dry??
1299 2018-05-31 21:30:16 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。
1300 2018-05-31 21:30:15 man idc how much mileage is on the car when i get that oil change i drive that mf like it just came off the lot
1301 2018-05-31 21:29:46 I did look into CBD oil and am going to try it as soon as I can afford it. :)
1302 2018-05-31 21:29:30 Oil limit
1303 2018-05-31 21:29:24 According to the API these tariffs will effect oil prices. Thoughts?

1307 2018-05-31 21:28:48 A sock account with triple digit followers and multiple media links? You must be new here.
1308 2018-05-31 21:28:34 I’m pissed at you guys on pipelines, Tories too, for complete failure and handing oil/gas to US. I’ve had enuff of the US. We need to toughen up and be smarter and develop other markets and partners. But Ottawa has fucked up oil/gas
1309 2018-05-31 21:28:32 So secede. Good luck with no oil or military. Watch how fast you decline into a third world country with one of the steepest class grades in the world.
1310 2018-05-31 21:28:02 Samantha Bee is that ugly , you can’t drink enough to make her sexy, she can kill 63 oil ion hard on by being on TV
1311 2018-05-31 21:27:56 3rd largest oil patch in the world and not enough for Canada? This is the proof that our gouvernement isn't interested in our living standard?
$4.5billion to move oil against the ppl will and no gas for our ppl. 
@RachelNotley
@JustinTrudeau 
Sorry Alberta but isn't that ironic?
1312 2018-05-31 21:27:31 The audience would win after we cover the court in baby oil and watch both of them eat shit.
1313 2018-05-31 21:27:26 It’s weird to get used to at first cause I used to wash mine everyday. So when you go a day without it, it feels so much worse than it really is just because you’re not used to feel it with oil in it from washing it everyday
1314 2018-05-31 21:27:16 THE BEST SURPRISES COME WITHOUT WARNING! Walmart has some Castor oil on sale if you need some 
1315 2018-05-31 21:27:12 Dude, shouting wrong doesn't make a person wrong. I gave you the definition. Put up or shut up.
1316 2018-05-31 21:27:04 This removes FDA over site and invites in Snake Oil Vendors!

Oh, This President is just GRANDSTANDING!

#DumpTrump #FDA #CompassionateUse #IdiotInChief #FreeStormy
1317 2018-05-31 21:26:53 Paid my bills , filled the tank and got an oil change 
1318 2018-05-31 21:26:51 But if oil is found in the sea between Lebanon and Israel I think it will start a really scary war on sea and land
1319 2018-05-31 21:26:50 Spot on. They can have 5 x  50 mill players warming the bench. Our money comes from our owners business deals. Theirs comes from the ground (OIL)
1320 2018-05-31 21:26:46 The trans-pacific pipeline is more important to Canada now than ever. We will send our oil to Europe and Asia who are good faith trading partners. Turn off the tap to the barbarians to the south.
1321 2018-05-31 21:26:44 How are people still offering me cannabis oil FFS  I got a visa from the trip I had last time 
1322 2018-05-31 21:26:44 Is this a sock account for dolphin boy? Kieran? Because he sounds just like it.
1323 2018-05-31 21:26:40 Anyone heard of Black Seed Oil ... and the wonders of it ? 
1324 2018-05-31 21:26:33 No. It wasn't. You've fundamentally misunderstood me. Maybe quit blowing yourself for long enough to comprehend what you're reading.
1325 2018-05-31 21:26:27 Lavender oil (I have a diffuser in every room), hot bath (Lush bath bomb a plus), glass of wine. My anxiety has been really bad lately. This usually helps!
1326 2018-05-31 21:25:57 I got my oil changed, car inspected, and plates renewed all in the last couple days. I did it!
1327 2018-05-31 21:25:50 Dude, just read the fucking definition of a democratic republic.
1328 2018-05-31 21:25:32 Christopher Brookmyre? One Fine Day In The Middle Of The Night is the only book that has ever made me laugh hysterically.

Quite embarrassing in the middle of the quiet rec room on an offshore oil platform.
1329 2018-05-31 21:25:32 That’s some tasty swing oil Brad!  #golfbeer
1330 2018-05-31 21:25:31 Maybe it’s from some oil leaking
1331 2018-05-31 21:25:31 I just made pizza dough & had olive oil on my hands. I thought I’d washed them well enough, but the way Clara’s been licking my hands says nope & also that she likes olive oil.
1332 2018-05-31 21:25:28 Lol know when to quit. You're wrong. Learn from it.
1333 2018-05-31 21:25:26 The USA gets over 50% of its oil from Canada. Show some balls and shut it all down.   End of trade war.
1334 2018-05-31 21:25:22 Oil money....
1335 2018-05-31 21:25:18 Ima change my car oil in a bit ):
1336 2018-05-31 21:25:14 Yes!! And it helps clean/remove excess oil from your eyelids!
1337 2018-05-31 21:25:08 Perch, coleslaw and buttered noodles with olive oil and basil
1338 2018-05-31 21:25:01 Not hurting my opinions. I didn't vote for him but the Iran deal was a deal with terrorist mullahs. Gas going up just kills Obama's illusion of us being "oil independent" like he tried to tell everyone. I don't want to fund terrorism
1339 2018-05-31 21:24:39 It is a republic that incorporates democratic processes. 
It's. A. Fucking. By. Definition. Democratic. Republic.

1341 2018-05-31 21:24:27 @voiceoftheunion simply explains the UK inability to manage industry when quoting gers.
North Sea oil 200000 barrels extracted each day at a selling price of ~$80 for each barrel.
Not a penny in sales.
1342 2018-05-31 21:24:01 And special fish oil.
1343 2018-05-31 21:23:48 By the way they can take thx out of pot no high if it is just for medication purposes cbd oil?
1344 2018-05-31 21:23:47 So, the knight-commander... Boiling in oil? That one never gets old.
1345 2018-05-31 21:23:38 im so mad im gonna have to out and buy vinegar/baking soda today because a can i dumped down the drain had a shitton of oil in it
1346 2018-05-31 21:23:37 I did garlic, soul seasoning, turmeric, cinnamon, black pepper, rosemary, cumin, curry, sage, olive oil, and paprika...I think that's everything.
1347 2018-05-31 21:23:36 Allah is the light of the heavens and the earth; a likeness of His light is as a niche in which is a lamp, the lamp is in a glass, (and) the glass is as it were a brightly shining star, lit from a blessed olive-tree, neither eastern nor western, the oil whereof almost gives...
1348 2018-05-31 21:23:33 I want a truck and i barely like getting oil changes 
1349 2018-05-31 21:23:33 And my extensionist just said to put argon oil on all the time and that should help to stop it drying out
1350 2018-05-31 21:23:27 Lolol take the L and move on. 
Maybe crack your old 101 level systems of government text again and brush up.
1351 2018-05-31 21:23:19 my thoughts on pipelines:
1) Western Canada is self sufficient with regard to oil production and supply.
2) Eastern Canada is unable to produce enough for their own supply and continue to import from Saudi Arabia, Africa and Venezuela.
3) Canada as an investor in TM makes sense
1352 2018-05-31 21:23:12 Why not start by keeping our crude oil and refine for our country instead of selling to the US for pennies on the dollar and buying at a premium. Then not charge us 51% tax .. maybe?  maybe start there.... just sayin...
1353 2018-05-31 21:23:02 The Oil Price Halved and you Charge the Same
1354 2018-05-31 21:22:54 CBD oil has changed my life for the better. Not only do I feel better but so do my loved ones 
#OrganicPlantLife
1355 2018-05-31 21:22:46 Dude. You're straight up denying reality now.
1356 2018-05-31 21:22:27 Nobody will want to purchase dirty bitumen thick oil. It is too costly to refine to an acceptable product, and now China and the huge container shipping markets have regulated for much less bitumen in fuels.
1357 2018-05-31 21:22:22 Nicely said... Oil dy your head
1358 2018-05-31 21:22:18 We have to have drama like they do. The squeaky wheel gets the oil.

1359 2018-05-31 21:22:13 What processes?
Democratic processes?
So you might say it incorporates functions of both a democracy and a republic?
So you might say it's a fucking democratic republic?

1361 2018-05-31 21:22:04 I bring my truck in to get one tire changed and an oil change and they come out and tell me I've basically been driving a death trap
1362 2018-05-31 21:21:59 1) You didn't "leave off a word"...you went on about there aren't enough installers. You simply lied that every home must be retrofitted.

2) You get your electricity thanks to one of largest democratic public works projects. You're welcome.

3) I'm urban elite, no car necessary.
1363 2018-05-31 21:21:57 Of course Cans love Amers, but we need to show some uncharacteristic strength.  This means US citizens will and should feel these decisions economically for the short term (hopefully).  Make them pay more for water, energy and oil - game on.
1364 2018-05-31 21:21:57 Plenty of other countries that’d take that oil haha. We could use it we’re getting charged $2.50 a litre right now.
1365 2018-05-31 21:21:44 Je vais quitter tout les RS pour un bon moment pour des raisons professionnelles, ceux qui ont mon num je serai toujours en contact. Bisou 
1366 2018-05-31 21:21:42 If anyone needs their oil changed I’ll do it for the very low price of a baconator
1367 2018-05-31 21:21:27 #bypoll #PowerOfOne 1paise oil price reduction begets 1 seat each for #BJP
1368 2018-05-31 21:21:05 Yup its taken 4 years but if cruid oil price is dropped then petrol and diesel price Should also be drop as well and I don't think so we should support modi ji blindly I like modi ji too but we should pay attention on price of petrol and disel....
1369 2018-05-31 21:20:55 It operates as a democratic republic, a constitutional republic, a federal republic, a presidential system, a liberal democracy, etc. etc. All of those terms accurately describes one part or another of the US system of government.
1370 2018-05-31 21:20:49 She seems to fit in nicely with the US Government that is in power at the moment. In the long run it is the furthering of the US Foreign Policy to have control of the Middle East oil and gas supplies, by force if necessary.
1371 2018-05-31 21:20:44 I wanna go on a date then get rubbed down with some oil.. no freaky shit.
1372 2018-05-31 21:20:33 hemp oil plastics. you see the solution is to gather with anti straw advocates and get them to slide their agenda to not banning laws but replace with hemp oil plastic laws.... this isn't hard, but it requires willingness to dialogue - discover - learn - create - cocreate...
1373 2018-05-31 21:20:32 You are sll shortsighted! Think about Iran = increasing oil price and condemnation from the allies, North Korea and world peace and China and trade differences. You don't have to be a scientist to connect the dots! The world has to grow up and respect the USA, no panzies=obama
1374 2018-05-31 21:20:17 I spilt tea tree oil on my vanity and now my whole room smells
1375 2018-05-31 21:20:16 Sooo I called Stirling Honda to schedule an oil change and I ended up having a 10 minute convo w the lady about hair and she ended it with “love you, bye” 
1376 2018-05-31 21:20:11 @CanadianPM @JustinTrudeau Trump is not to be trusted period...his word means nothing...by him, deals are made to be broken....so take the top 3 US imports & hike the tariffs! 1. Mineral fuels including oil: $77.9 billion  2. Vehicles: $56.2 billion   3. Machinery: $21.5 billion
1377 2018-05-31 21:19:36 In general. I’m not using it or don’t care to. But that study laced muffins with palm oil to up the saturated fat. I’m wondering if that oil is harmful like say peanut oil and such.
1378 2018-05-31 21:19:26 Oily food mainly or food drenched in oil?
1379 2018-05-31 21:19:17 水(ウォーター)とは仲が悪いです。
1380 2018-05-31 21:19:04 I guess running the risk of future impositions of the people who live and work in Scotland is worth the risk. Of course all that oil money Scotland sent to the Treasury over the last 30 years was well spent. LOL.
1381 2018-05-31 21:19:00 You missed the part where I already said I misspoke there.
1382 2018-05-31 21:18:49 $180K? What will that buy? Will it purchase a new stream? Will it clean oil off of animals & get it out of the soil? $180 grand is the cost of doin' business for Big Oil - they need to be fined $180 million for the FIRST spill - then we'd see 'world-class' responses. #cdnpoli
1383 2018-05-31 21:18:47 Fun fact: if I ask you how are you and you snap your fingers at me and just say "oil change" I'll actually move 200% slower it's just a little known glitch in my system you activated...
1384 2018-05-31 21:18:34 Their great silky spearhead of his desire sheathed in rose oil / anointed rose oil teased their anal fortress
1385 2018-05-31 21:18:30 Clinique take the day away is pretty much like coconut oil but especially for makeup removal & not harsh at all!
1386 2018-05-31 21:18:21 What's worse: my truck being 24,000 miles past due for an oil change, or the fact that all three pairs of shoes I own have holes in the bottom. I've been avoiding puddles for two weeks now.
1387 2018-05-31 21:18:05 Apparently it is, soncebyou don’t seem to understand a dang thing about our government. Smdh
1388 2018-05-31 21:18:01 Oh I adore the aroma of Thyme.

I use the essential oil too and it smells the same.

brothers grapple and swing.
1393 2018-05-31 21:17:17 We're not worried about the rest of the world, we're setting OUR goals. Currently only 17% of our electricity is from renewables; there's no reason we can't hit 50% in 20 years.

That is unless the oil/gas industry manages to stymie that effort.
1394 2018-05-31 21:17:15 Tea tree oil is sex to my face
1395 2018-05-31 21:17:10 No chance of: “This was a bad idea and we are going to deport all that voted in favor of Brexit to the outer Hebrides, or to a disused oil platform on the North Sea”?
1396 2018-05-31 21:17:09 all is well then, congratulations clearly in order for setting the table for AB oil to sell for $20 a barrel while we pay $1.50 a liter for gas at the pumps!

1403 2018-05-31 21:16:33 #Trudeau's #pipeline purchase: doubling-down on a dishonest myth. We CAN fund future renewable energy projects without oil extraction: appropriately taxing corporations and the wealthy would be a good start. #stopcapitalism #cdnpoli #bcpoli #kamloops #corporatewelfare
1404 2018-05-31 21:16:11 Are there any EEF projects that have demonstrated a statistically significant impact when scaled up to a large number of schools? Can anyone name them and provide the raw data to be independently interrogated? Mostly it seems to be expensively produced snake oil.
1405 2018-05-31 21:16:10 How are your reps elected?
1406 2018-05-31 21:16:04 I’m basically asking if it’s a decent or shitty oil we shouldn’t touch. Palm oil was what that study decided to use for sat fat intake.
1407 2018-05-31 21:16:02 If you're eating lots of sugary, refined foods, they could be contributing to your breakouts. They don’t directly cause acne but they do exacerbate oil production on the face.

1417 2018-05-31 21:15:24 Could bathe in coconut oil 24/7
1418 2018-05-31 21:15:23 Just thinking about either right now is making me cringe. Going to dip my hands in quenching oil to soothe the discomfort...
1419 2018-05-31 21:15:16 Idk if it’s oil free but I’m a greasy gal and have been using L’Oreal Infallible for about 5 years now it is so matte and so thicc and so pale
1420 2018-05-31 21:15:08 Same word, it just means 2 things in different contexts.
1421 2018-05-31 21:15:06 Thank you!!You can just mix it in a face oil or moisturizer! I have pure tea tree oil so its not recommended to put it staright on to your skin because it could burn.
1422 2018-05-31 21:15:01 2 parts snake oil.
1 part Kool-Aid.
Rub into any appendage while sipping.
Creates fifteen minutes of fame.
Also comes with hook, line & sinker for a small additional cost at your local Trump merchandise store. Or you can buy it all from a guy named Dino B. on any Trump thread.
1423 2018-05-31 21:14:51 Naw, just democracy as a word. There are 2 definitions. As a descriptor for another system and in generalized terms (such as Liberal Democracy), it just means a representative system where voting happens. As a system itself, it's the type of system with majority rule.
1424 2018-05-31 21:14:44 How about stop sending them our oil? Keep it within our borders, refine and distribute within our country at a fraction of what we are buying our oil BACK from the US at!!  On that note... don’t let them near our fresh water either!!
1425 2018-05-31 21:14:39 I just made hemp seed pesto using Thai basil, hemp seeds, grapeseed oil, nooch and a splash of lemon juice--YUMMY!!

How is the hemp milk in tea?
1426 2018-05-31 21:14:21 The key to good pasta sauce is putting your garlic into the oil when the oil is cold. You are welcome in advance.
1427 2018-05-31 21:13:59 I wasn't too bothered but I was always curious as to why an oil rich resource rich country was called a subsidy junkie when in fact we punch above our weight...also the too wee too poor too stupid tag irked me also

1433 2018-05-31 21:13:27 How to avoid acne x 

-Keep youe face clean
-Whether or not you have acne, it's important to wash your face twice daily.
-Washing your face will remove dead skin cells, impurities, and extra oil from the surface of your skin.

1439 2018-05-31 21:13:00 Trudeau just cancelled NAFTA on Canada's end and I assume that Mexico will be close behind. Say bye to your cheap oil, natural gas and electricity you buy from Canada cheaper than a Canadian pays for it.
1440 2018-05-31 21:12:58 Thank you  I’ve been doing ok with sleep past few days since getting CBD oil getting to sleep around 3ish & sleeping 7 hrs. Only waking up once.
1441 2018-05-31 21:12:58 Was he trying to sell you his oil pipe line for your FCpass.
1442 2018-05-31 21:12:47 Lol go back to your 101 level political systems texts, boo.
1443 2018-05-31 21:12:39 For the same reasons (oil shocks, as this was before the North Sea oil heyday).
1444 2018-05-31 21:12:22 History will be kind on Obama once the old curmudgeons finally die off. Trump on the other hand, will always be exactly who he is. A snake oil salesmen that fooled a bunch of desperate people who were afraid their culture would be forgotten.
1445 2018-05-31 21:12:19 Hey @TuckerGoodrich you are the oil guy right? What’s your opinion on palm oil?
1446 2018-05-31 21:12:18 Definitely gonna start using oil at night! 
1447 2018-05-31 21:12:18 No matter how much I forgive and try to forget, I feel like I’ll never truly forget. It’s like trying to remove oil from water. Shit will always linger
1448 2018-05-31 21:12:06 All jokes etc aside. 
I personally know people out west, and oil field workers too.
2016, NDP leader was hard to get a hold of, and had no clue what to do with the massive lay offs. Oil ending wasnt Canadas fault (any party). But for the word on the street is, AB wants NDP Gone.

1450 2018-05-31 21:11:58 Why dont you do something about the scumbag oil company's  Raping of the consumer. So much for a little tax bump we have to turn around and give it to oil companies.  What happened about or pipelines in all our resources,  thought we weren't relying on foreign interests  Any more
1451 2018-05-31 21:11:34 How do u use your tea tree oil?
1452 2018-05-31 21:11:33 Well lucky we still are able to give our oil to them for 30% discount.
1453 2018-05-31 21:11:31 Canada is bailing out an American oil company while engaging in a trade war with the US over other resource exports.
It's been a weird few days.
1454 2018-05-31 21:11:17 Sounds like they used muffins full of either palm oil as the sat fat or sunflower oil as the unsat.
1455 2018-05-31 21:11:15 So that oil then it dey your bed stand 
1456 2018-05-31 21:11:14 Do not believe for one moment that this will be the last time Big Oil dumps it's liabilities on the public.
1457 2018-05-31 21:11:14 will you replant all the rain forest destroyed by Nestle ingredients, palm oil etc, when you achieve zero deforestation by 2020? You say you ‘strongly oppose deforestation’. Yet 27% of all your ingredients cause deforestation (according to your own data).

1459 2018-05-31 21:10:57 Last I checked pipelines are made of steel. So USA hits canada with 25% tarriffs o steel just as the KMX pipeline is announced this week. Guess we hit the back with 25% oil tarriffs. oil up. us markets will sink. relations wonky.
1460 2018-05-31 21:10:33 CBD oil is a healthy way to treat pain, anxiety, sleep disorders and more.  If you're not familiar with it yet, just google it.  Research studies show it can potentially treat a wide range of health conditions - naturally. #CBD #ChronicPain #Anxiety
1461 2018-05-31 21:10:29 I should buy a t-shirt that reads I hate mayo, but no one would get that reference except my boyfriend. I literally hate the actual condiment. I mean, it's just eggs, oil, and fat. I like sriracha or mustard. Maybe some cumen on protein and red pepper flake with pasta.
1462 2018-05-31 21:10:27 Thank you to those that make stuff especially natural hair products and black soaps and do not use nut oil. I love you 
I have a problem with anything that contains nuts especially coconut. Food or soap or cream.Didn't find out until earlier this year.
1463 2018-05-31 21:10:26 You don't know what words mean.
1464 2018-05-31 21:10:25 Your welcome girl  also since you are dry try and exfoliate at least once to twice a week to reduce dry pataches/peeling and I say start using a facial oil to moisturize at night after you cleanse your face it should really help out !
1465 2018-05-31 21:10:23 I’d love it if someone said no more Glugs of olive oil on everything you make ya fat cunt
1466 2018-05-31 21:10:23 You're learning mate, just like anchovies, olive oil and chilli flakes ;-)
1467 2018-05-31 21:10:17 Oil & Gas production is surging in USA They don't need us. The rest, they already have & signed agreements with other countries also. Trump holds all the cards.

1493 2018-05-31 21:08:31 Of course. I said democracy earlier and admitted the mistake. That doesn't make it not democratic, by definition. It just means it isn't a hard-and-fast democracy.
1494 2018-05-31 21:08:15 Premier, you and @JustinTrudeau have backed us into a corner.  Justin with his "phase out the oil sands" remark and the Alberta NDP with constant delays and contempt for big oil.
1495 2018-05-31 21:08:01 @RoyBlunt , Nice try Senator, tell us how the great tax cut and jobs act  is putting more money in our pockets when we pay more than fifty cents a gallon at the pump, looks like to me like tha big oil got themselves a win win from this one.

1497 2018-05-31 21:07:42 How can they do this to you, you gave their oil company a pipeline yesterday!  
1498 2018-05-31 21:07:30 Funny, you haven't proven my wrong yet. This basically amounts to me defining words and you shouting "wrong" and slinging all that worthless paper around like it means something.
1499 2018-05-31 21:07:28 Keep in mind how the production of solar panels creates A LOT of toxic waste. I’m all about clean energy as an ideal, but we also need secure energy dense sources. Also, so many products are produced by oil.   I wish we had more nuclear.
1500 2018-05-31 21:07:25 and you’re getting it, as one by one people realize the snake oil Dems have been selling for decades.
1501 2018-05-31 21:07:20 All the EU, China, Canada and Mexico have to so is drop the dollar and start oil trading in the Euro

1507 2018-05-31 21:06:41 Trump canceled Iran deal that has a direct impact on gas price. Doing it he also helped Putin, making more $$ from Russian oil. The Oligarchs are happy, even though sanctions not lifted, but they are making more now. Trade off?!

1512 2018-05-31 21:06:19 I used to use an organic oil based spray until someone told me it could kill ladybirds so now I'm scared to use anything. I just keep washing the plants down to slow the spread.

1515 2018-05-31 21:06:04 Oh nice! The guy made me nervous because, at first, he said “we don’t have gluten free churros.” And then he said “well they’re fried in the same oil with the regular ones.” But I feel like he may have been misinformed since Disney usually has separate fryers.
1516 2018-05-31 21:05:58 I'm saying that without the CPC, Keystone would be way down on the Republicans wish list, if there at all. Their domestic oil industry is already doing gangbusters on its own.

1531 2018-05-31 21:04:29 But more a product of changes in oil prices and exchange rate, while projections for European export losses from trade conflict are missing. So, not really on target - at least not in a sustainable way, no?

That's not what I'm forgetting, but I did forget. (Does that make sense?)

1540 2018-05-31 21:03:25 After just a few weeks of working in a car dealership I've come to realize how much money I save myself every time I work on my truck. Save yourself a few thousand over your life and learn how to do an oil change and brakes  simple stuff everyone should learn to do
1541 2018-05-31 21:03:18 I’m raised in Edmonton and support #TMX, but how is building a pipeline to burn more oil supporting work in climate change?

1545 2018-05-31 21:02:48 So changing car oil isn't housework..? Or just isn't as valued because gynocentric bias..?
1546 2018-05-31 21:02:41 Or a grasp on reality.  Perhaps people should stop turning the renewable energy argument into an all or none false dichotomy and recognize that wind, hydro, solar, oil, and gas all can play a part in a diverse and thriving economy that supports public investment.
1547 2018-05-31 21:02:41 That's a fine distinction. I don't subscribe to it, but it's sound logic. I just like Democratic Republic better because I find it more descriptive on a practical level. But I wouldn't say it isn't a constitutional republic just like I wouldn't say it isn't a federal republic.
1548 2018-05-31 21:02:40 You’ve made me want to go and crack open a pine essential oil 
1549 2018-05-31 21:02:34 I know the Mercers owning Cambridge Analytica and owing the IRS BILLIONS are in Trouble. The way to attack the Kochs is through the oil prices

1556 2018-05-31 21:01:45 I used to watch Sci-fi with my dad when I was a kid and think the future was gunna be flying cars and robots but I just ordered a massage roller and a new oil drizzler off Amazon at 10pm and they’re arriving tomorrow by 6pm and if this is all the future is then I’m happy

1559 2018-05-31 21:01:22 Depends on whether you see accuracy of metaphor as the only kind of insult poetry to want. To call someone a depleted Ozone or a busted oil pipeline may have a kind of aptness but they don’t really roll off the tongue. I want the full range of invective to assault my enemies
1560 2018-05-31 21:01:09 And then you come to say .....nora jeeatay gaa !
Its bloody fake and you fools are going for it ...oil assed !
Hahahahahh
1561 2018-05-31 21:01:01 How long after you started using it did notice positive effects? And, again, if it isn't seed oil, from what is it derived?
1562 2018-05-31 21:01:01 Not buying your snake oil, #WiddleDon  I’ll stick with the MSM thanks. They’re not perfect but they’re more truthful.
1563 2018-05-31 21:00:43 May 31, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1564 2018-05-31 21:00:42 Any idea the resources you get from Canada? 40% of your oil, natural gas, electricity, lumber and water. There is more to trade than beans and corn. Btw, Mexico buys a shitload of corn from your farmers. Trudeau just cancelled NAFTA on our end, you think Mexico will be next?

1568 2018-05-31 21:00:25 Ooo yes, all the dreamy creamed coconut and coconut oil is wonderful for your hair. So pleased to hear you're enjoying it, sweets! 
1569 2018-05-31 21:00:24 Yeah huge oil tariffs are what the Trump voter was looking for. I wonder if they will still love him when they can't afford to "Roll Coal" anymore?
1570 2018-05-31 21:00:20 RT @LivingSafely: Ritz Original Crackers this June? Its top four ingredients are flour, soybean oil, sugar and cottonseed oil.

1572 2018-05-31 21:00:13 Coconut oil is very healthy. It is high in special fats called medium chain triglycerides, which are metabolized differently than other fats
1573 2018-05-31 20:59:57 Did you get that massive oil leak fixed before you drove her down there? 
1574 2018-05-31 20:59:55 I work here because 1. Oil, 2. Oil and 3. I hate winter. It sure would be nice to see it go blue in my lifetime. They vilify liberal thinking out here so badly.
1575 2018-05-31 20:59:38 D lips.... U dey use palm oil lipgloss nih
1576 2018-05-31 20:59:38 In a desperate bid to keep its last remaining proposed oil pipeline alive, Canada has decided to buy Kinder Morgan’s Trans Mountain Pipeline system for an estimated C$4.5 billion.
1577 2018-05-31 20:59:36 The guy annoyed me aswear,Ana zaune qallau
1578 2018-05-31 20:59:22 Had a guy at the last Toorcamp show me how to cook them. Tasted pretty good. Olive oil in a hot skillet, drop them in and they cook down in a few minutes.
1579 2018-05-31 20:59:19 Finally bought an oil cleanser today so maybe my skin can stop being so moody.
1580 2018-05-31 20:59:13 I'm just one of the silent majority who understands that Canada holds the third largest oil reserves and many engineers and scientist have devoted their careers to extract, prepare product for shipping and designed the best and safest shipping/transport methods for world markets.
1581 2018-05-31 20:59:09 someone else mentioned almond oil! I gotta see what it’s about ! lol
1582 2018-05-31 20:58:46 I guess KHOU changed the oil every 3000 miles.
1583 2018-05-31 20:58:41 I gotta cop me some black seed oil ASAP
1584 2018-05-31 20:58:27 I have to try sweet almond oil! I never really see it in stores !
1585 2018-05-31 20:58:13 You know your front door needs oil when it sounds like the first second of Atrevete te te
1586 2018-05-31 20:57:59 Of truck drivers, carpenters... The Fed: central banks June meeting... policy makers expected to raise intertest rates for 2nd time... oil, lumber, and cement have increased this year..
 Shortage of truck drivers, carpenters, electricians,
1587 2018-05-31 20:57:43 Lmao no the hell I didn’t I said that about black seed oil
1588 2018-05-31 20:57:41 Growth Comm was done using WM figures meaning we could be Indy using THEIR accepted numbers! Oil or whisky figures & others NOT included in those figures. Using SCOT figures, oil/whisky etc. we get a DIFFERENT picture altogether. Brexit=austerity. Even IF indy=austerity I go YES!
1589 2018-05-31 20:57:33 I only use coconut oil for nuro massages das it
1590 2018-05-31 20:57:32 Imma ask the dumbest Q on Twitter ... @CatelynnLowell is that oil in your pasta water? So it doesn’t stick? #ineedtoknow lol @TylerBaltierra
1591 2018-05-31 20:57:30 LADIES IMAGINE THIS : it’s 2069, you’re currently sitting on your smart toilet shitting your brains out because your robot added motor oil to your martini. Your kid is yelling at you to hurry the fuck up cuz he has to tinkle. He’s 4 and drank the same martini
1592 2018-05-31 20:57:23 Life is like a washing machine.
Remember the spots you got out of your clothes instead if thinking about the staines that are still on like oil or the burning mark from a cigarette.
-MV- #quotes
1593 2018-05-31 20:57:21 So I'm getting my oil changed and while I'm waiting I see them vaccumming my car out and remember I have a random pair of undies in my floor board lmao awkward...
1594 2018-05-31 20:57:15 Getting my oil changed and mentioned I'm driving to @OUBioStation a lot this summer. 

Technician fondly remembers an ichthyology class with Bill Matthews and can recall smallmouth's scientific name better than I.
1595 2018-05-31 20:57:08 "Yes drill Sergeant!!!"
1596 2018-05-31 20:57:05 No big deal unless water, lumber, electricity and oil are important to you.
1597 2018-05-31 20:57:02 And if the renewables were produced in Alberta, it would help to diversify the economy and provide jobs for former oil workers.
1598 2018-05-31 20:57:01 it has, but brokenness also comes in degrees, and the differences in degree between [current=bad] and [future=much worse] are not trivial. you can get home in a car with a bad suspension and an oil leak. you can't get home in a car that's been vaporized by a meteorite strike.
1599 2018-05-31 20:56:57 Today we have been installing sectional cast iron rads. Haven’t had to build stuff like this for years. Back breaking heavy mind you! Nice finish though. Will post some pics tomorrow when they’re finished. This was on top of an oil to gas conversion and cylinder relocation! #busy
1600 2018-05-31 20:56:45 No but seriously my barber will just recommend one of his own products which won't fit my hair at all lmao. I sometimes use argan oil tho
1601 2018-05-31 20:56:44 @sullivanradio Oil is fungible and cannot be included in trade data.  US exports more oil out than we buy from Canada.  Also,  North Sea oil is the same as Canada’s
1602 2018-05-31 20:56:43 They should ban olive oil Jamie. That’d fuck every recipe you ever made...
1603 2018-05-31 20:56:41 It really is a bomb ass oil. I love jojoba oil and sweet almond oil for my hair.
1604 2018-05-31 20:56:14 Excuse my ignorance, but, Why cant a facility that seperates the oil be built in alberta??
1605 2018-05-31 20:56:13 Chile I been done with coconut oil long ago... Only olive and almond oil...
1606 2018-05-31 20:56:13 {I shake my head vehemently.} Nope. Just drinking coffee and preparing myself for a day of laying on my back covered in oil.
1607 2018-05-31 20:56:01 The fact that people believed this snake oil peddler. ...Sounds familiar, no??
1608 2018-05-31 20:55:42 Tariff A tax imposed on imported goods and service. Tariffs are used to restrict trade as they increase the price of good and service. Is it better for us to continue import cheap Quality Item￼ instead of creating new opportunities in America. America does have steel and oil.
1609 2018-05-31 20:55:01 My coconut oil just be smearing off in this heat 
1610 2018-05-31 20:54:59 hair and skin! I mainly use it on my hair and I like it soooo much more than coconut oil! It adds a long lasting shine and moisture !
1611 2018-05-31 20:54:59 The beautiful mountain ranges, the cold and the oil
1612 2018-05-31 20:54:55 He's not worth it. Snake oil salesman. Govt has already provided about $150 million for Flint's water problem. Not to mention, Moore is from DAVISON, Michigan, NOT Flint.
1613 2018-05-31 20:54:50 So sorry to hear. Please research CBD oil. It’s available online.
1614 2018-05-31 20:54:39 I think we should ban Jamie Oliver cooking shows cos the amount of oil that fat prick uses is not healthy
1615 2018-05-31 20:54:20 I might get some oil for my camping trip...gotta stop on my way home.
1616 2018-05-31 20:54:18 @lustrelux lately my parents have substituted creamer with solid coconut oil. My dad is prediabetic and so he’s trying to lose weight. That one change in his morning routine has made him feel less hungry, more satisfied, and lose some lbs! My mom also reports feeling less hungry.
1617 2018-05-31 20:54:06 Been prolonging a oil change 
1618 2018-05-31 20:54:00 Oh the irony.  A mass of people who are living in a city that owes its wealth and prosperity to the very oil they protest against.
1619 2018-05-31 20:53:49 Snake oil springs to mind?
1620 2018-05-31 20:53:45  Crude Oil Prices

1621 2018-05-31 20:53:44 Whatever happened to that robots vomit oil guy
1622 2018-05-31 20:53:42 More reason to create new markets for oil.
1623 2018-05-31 20:53:27  no vex, I deliberately didn't shade cocoyam and groundnut oil for breakfast because I thought I would be shaking a table you were on, didn't know Biko.
1624 2018-05-31 20:53:17 I've been trying to get my oil change for the last hour or so and they're talked to everyone that came after me I'm scared they're going to tell me there is a shitload wrong with it
1625 2018-05-31 20:53:16 Carrot seed oil has spf 30!!!
1626 2018-05-31 20:53:07 Secret oil fields. Haven’t seen that old chestnut for a while.
1627 2018-05-31 20:52:55 And what do you suggest we do with that million barrels of oil that we are not trading. We can't just sit on it. And I don't see refineries popping up all across Canada.
1628 2018-05-31 20:52:55 Normally when I get my oil changed I let them talk me into getting whatever else I need, today they offered a cabin air filter, a $50 additional charge, and I decided against it. And thank god I did cuz I looked up the part at autozone and she was $9!!!
1629 2018-05-31 20:52:50 Eucalyptus oil
1630 2018-05-31 20:52:48 He wouldve made a fair point except for the race baiting 'white priviledge' comment. Too bad his racial bias overrides his common sense.
1631 2018-05-31 20:52:46 Well, I am actually giving him a small dose of the same thing I use - CBD isolate mixed with an oil. It's mixed locally (I am in Canada). 

The key is making sure it is 100% CBD, with no THC and then little kitties don't get high and just feel better.
1632 2018-05-31 20:52:39 We're committed to using only the most sustainable sources of palm oil in our products. We have removed it wherever possible and 100% of the palm oil used in M&S products is RSPO certified.

1637 2018-05-31 20:52:00 The Pool Of Oil At The Top Of Your Peanut Butter Jar Is Actually Your Mom
1638 2018-05-31 20:51:37 my face is like a oil bucket dawg but mi look young.
1639 2018-05-31 20:51:22 Notice the more red you find, the less blue attitudes.... even amongst the young.  Is it regional or just my imagination?
1640 2018-05-31 20:51:05 What's the difference between your *watts* and a power plant's *megawatts*?  What is molten salt storage? Can a solar panel generate power from rain drops? 

I'm glad you have a hobby, but it has nothing to do with grid-level power generation.
1641 2018-05-31 20:50:53 I know man. If you’re looking at global economic strategies. Accumulating debt from rivals to bolster a military basically making impossible for said rivals to collect seems to be the strategy we are going with. Iraq challenged that via other currency for oil. Hence, invasion
1642 2018-05-31 20:50:51 If it's helping people get off smoking that's great. But my experience as an asthmatic is that one second-hand breath of the haribo-flavoured vape smog basically shuts my lungs down instantly. I suspect the perfume triggers it, and the oil carrier sticks in the lungs.
1643 2018-05-31 20:50:46 So where does cbd come from? If it's hemp based oil.
1644 2018-05-31 20:50:41 Gonna try this one day. 

1. Oil Cleanse (remove makeup/sunblock) 
2. pH balanced cleanser (gel/foam) pH5.5 
3. AHA or BHA. alternate days (2-3x a week)
4. Toner (moisture) 
5. Serum (like ?) or Essence (?) 
6. Moisturise 
7. SPF if during the day. 

Clay/Sheet mask weekly.
1645 2018-05-31 20:50:41 It really is. Also, the types of food you consume matters. Less carbohydrates, more fat. Especially omega 3. Avocados, nuts, olive oil... Excess intake of carbohydrates and fruits increases the risk of diabetes and brain diseases. Eggs don't hurt too.
1646 2018-05-31 20:50:37 For 2016, the value of U.S. energy imports from Canada was $53 billion, while the value of U.S. energy exports to Canada was $14 billion. Crude oil makes up most U.S. energy imports from Canada, averaging 3.3 million barrels per day in 2016.

And u think we need... military?
1647 2018-05-31 20:50:30 Treble rashers of bacon, 7 sausages, full can of baked beans, an entire black pudding, 4 hash browns, covered in grated cheese, cooked in full fat oil.

Ban this, facist.
1648 2018-05-31 20:50:14 Lmao...best rethink as that 30% includes the oil sold at a 50% discount to wti spot rates because its to heavy for anyone else to buy. And fyi were exactly are u going to get ur gasoline from if the decide to stop refining canadian oil and shipping the gas back?..lmao
1649 2018-05-31 20:50:08 @johnlewisretail Hi, is the Jojoba Oil range available in store or is it only online?  Thanks!

1651 2018-05-31 20:49:36 As an undergrad, a few friends & I developed our own version of Pong with modifiable physics parameters (paddle / ball friction to impose spin & ball velocity), surrounding medium (air, water, oil), and the relative density of the ball and the surrounding medium. RIP Ted Dabney.
1652 2018-05-31 20:49:33 Not really. Ideally the lands would go into the park system. But there’s way too much oil and gas in da erf for that.
1653 2018-05-31 20:49:24 Looks like it. I say impeach #45 and the Big Oil Companies might go lient on the gas....or not. Lol!  But hey it could happen. Y'all see he got in there. 
1654 2018-05-31 20:49:17 @supervisorrivas Big Oil is against you so you have my vote.
1655 2018-05-31 20:49:11 no heat and coconut oil works best for me! I cut my hair short a little back and instantly regretted it 
1656 2018-05-31 20:49:06 Under pierre trudeau, he nationalized oil. Under jr, he nationalized a pipeline. See a trend?
1657 2018-05-31 20:49:01  argan oil and honey products thoooooooo will make anyone’s hair feel amazing & smell amazing
1658 2018-05-31 20:48:59 Para el mes de junio a mi me salen en IA-Sectores Europa:

Se quedó cerquita TNO.

¿Llegaste a estudiar en su día un sistema de IA con 3 posiciones en lugar de 2?
1659 2018-05-31 20:48:59 僕を酸化させたらダメだよ。オイルにとって酸化は命取り。…僕を見守っててね⁇
1660 2018-05-31 20:48:37 Totally what you would need that is not easily divisible/removable/consumable in a week - herbs, oil, vinegar, salt, pepper - don't make me buy that and I don't want to take it away!
1661 2018-05-31 20:48:25 maybe you should try the one without jojoba oil
1662 2018-05-31 20:48:22 Those facing greatest risk..who would that be? Those who put bread & butter on the table through the gas & oil industry support your businesses, buy your fish, wear your clothes, borrow money from your bank.  I live on the coast of Van Isle I support KM.. protesters need to stfu
1663 2018-05-31 20:48:12 Oil refinery? Furnace? Something related to energy production?
1664 2018-05-31 20:48:09 "i think you need to change your rotors and drain pl-"

1670 2018-05-31 20:47:38 Doin more with less??  WHERE IS THE OIL MONEY, THIEF??????????????
1671 2018-05-31 20:47:32 Castor oil + Aloe Vera!!
1672 2018-05-31 20:47:27 Still not cheap for something, like all supplements,  MIGHT yield benefits. If it's hemp based and it's oil but it's not seed oil then the source is? I'm not throwing shade. I will probably try it at some point, I just wish it cost a bit less to see if it will work for me.
1673 2018-05-31 20:47:14 Firefighting foam was made by Russian engineer and chemist Aleksandr Loran in 1902. Loran was a teacher in Baku which was the home of the Russian oil industry at that period. Dude was seriously impressed by the hard to put out fires so he fucked their shit up with making the foam
1674 2018-05-31 20:46:49 SUMMER TIP FOR PESKY BUGS: put 10 drops of pure pepper mint oil in a water spray bottle to keep bugs away dis summmmeeerrrr. once a week and no bugs will wanna go near ya house
1675 2018-05-31 20:46:42 Use peppermint oil as well I used it last year n it helped loads x

1677 2018-05-31 20:46:32 Don't be a fool.. Increasing oil price.. Strengthing dollar has led to rupee fall.. It will rebound.. Stop misguiding people.. @OmarAbdullah @RahulGandhi @ArvindKejriwal
1678 2018-05-31 20:46:17 The obsession with "quality" ingredients is largely bullshit. "00" flour is precious here but standard in Italy. San Marzano tomatoes just happen to grow around Vesuvius/Napoli. Almost all botanicals in olive oil burn off well under 300F, let alone 800F.
1679 2018-05-31 20:46:14 Dudette, you can not extrapolate your tinker toy deployment to 500MW power plants.  It's clear you know ZERO, and like to know ZERO.

1699 2018-05-31 20:43:29 So where does the oil and usual car drippings drain into from the riverside car parks needed to catch these water taxis?
1700 2018-05-31 20:42:49 My old Benz... oil pressure at idle (once warmed up) seems to drop more every other day. Comes right back to full under way, but extremely disconcerting at idle.
1701 2018-05-31 20:42:43 Well since it has no sound and I have never seen the movie.... what's your point???
1702 2018-05-31 20:42:37 Maybe an oil spill training exercise in the car park? 
1703 2018-05-31 20:42:31 Every house we moved into had to have all of the external doors anointed with oil & a prayer of protection over the house to remove any demons that may still be residing inside, and prevent them from re-entering. A hedge of angelic protection had to be prayed around the property.

1708 2018-05-31 20:41:38 We should just hold all of our Oil, Lumber, Steel and Electricity at the borders. Just for a few months. Americans an have no idea how bad that would hurt their economy. If Trudeau only had the balls.

1737 2018-05-31 20:38:01 Oh if life was only  as simple as everyone wishes it to be.  I wish we would steal the oil for reimbursement of billions of dollars sent to rebuild the infrastructure that the terrorists  destroy.  But we don't and we won't.

1772 2018-05-31 20:33:41 If you outline your house in cinnamon, supposedly the ants will not cross because they do not like it. In the same token you can put cinnamon in oil and shake it and spray it on things and the ants will not go on it.
1773 2018-05-31 20:33:32 The reason that KDP help Turkey is basacilly to do with oil trade between Kurdistan and Turkey. So they support Turkish warcrimes within Iraq and Syria against fellow Kurds. Turks have been no friends of the Kurds in Kurdistan and likely never will show them any respect.

1779 2018-05-31 20:33:02 It's not always about consumption. The oil is used in many products. And if you use that percentage there's more than 100% since 100% is used for human use
1780 2018-05-31 20:33:00 Put tariffs on oil as well. And talk Mexico into doing the same
1781 2018-05-31 20:32:55 Bet the U.S. can hold out longer on the steel and aluminum tariff's than Mexico, Canada and the EU can when they start their tariff's on food from the US..we don't need the steel but lets see them start eating their wine and oil products.

1806 2018-05-31 20:30:10 Ffs David, come on sort this out. This is ridiculous. It's now 7 months at an existing oil site.

1813 2018-05-31 20:29:23 Yes, but I'm refuting a different claim ("that if we don't do it here, it'll happen elsewhere") which is used to suggest increasing oil sands capacity doesn't increase [global] emissions (in gov't reports). That logic is inappropriate to a collective action problem.
1814 2018-05-31 20:29:23 Or the actual costs to the environment in the production of those batteries.

1817 2018-05-31 20:29:09 The “Hunger Games” films were basically “Nobama: the Movie.”
1818 2018-05-31 20:29:06 Really, what about all the other states and  their water quality because you are allowing fracking, oil wells and god knows what else, since your hiding everything. We all know you subsiding states that support your emperor (@realDonaldTrump ).
1819 2018-05-31 20:28:58 Maduro wants a full trade war btw US and China so China mit buy his oil and crytopetro; Saudi Salman wants to visit china so he could find out wht deal reached btw US and China if he can also cut a deal, more important, Saudi wants OBOR investment concentrated in south east asia;
1820 2018-05-31 20:28:48 Let’s talk about disposal fees.
Bet they don’t want to talk about what to do with that Prius battery.
1821 2018-05-31 20:28:34 “You need help getting your car straight, Shelby?”- dude I work with that’s been thirsting after me that OBVIOUSLY doesn’t know me 

First off, I don’t need no fucking man to top off coolant and oil, thanks. 
Second off, if I did, I wouldn’t call you.
1822 2018-05-31 20:28:32 Yes it does I only used it for a few months after going natural because it was the hype but I’ll stick to plain water and olive oil like I use to maybe a little Murray’s if needed
1823 2018-05-31 20:28:23 I just don't understand the idea that only one description can be accurate. Dude wants to shit on my education, but the fact that different descriptions for the same systems exist and are correct is some 101 level political theory.
1824 2018-05-31 20:28:23 don't kid yourself. Stop the flow of oil and other natural resources.
1825 2018-05-31 20:28:11 @Andeavor's Goff: In 1969, we built the refinery in Nikiski to handle Cook Inlet crude oil. #OGalaska
1826 2018-05-31 20:28:10 it doesn’t hurt much at all. it feels like getting popped with hot oil or getting snapped over and over with a rubber band
1827 2018-05-31 20:28:10 @zionoil Is the oil drilling report for the Israel govt mostly to do with enviromental data? or is it more?
1828 2018-05-31 20:28:09 Brought my car to the dealer for an oil and filter change.. it’s been over an hour 
1829 2018-05-31 20:28:00 Clearly nationalizing oil was a bad idea, so is this deal
1830 2018-05-31 20:27:51 comedy and politics are like oil and water, they cause trouble when mixed
#SamanthaBee #Roseanne
1831 2018-05-31 20:27:36 Smoked flower for the first time today,,, definitely gonna stick with oil 
1832 2018-05-31 20:27:28 Coconut oil
1833 2018-05-31 20:27:25 israel has trade relations with? and who funds them? USA. Well hegemonic USA has bilateral relations with Saudi Arabia, Israel. unstable, oil interests in Syria - Golan heights, who are the vested interests in this particular ponzi scheme?
1834 2018-05-31 20:27:19 2) did the 2011 oil spill negatively affect penguin egg size? A) not statistically- there's more variability between islands and samples than we can explain by before/after the spill
1835 2018-05-31 20:27:19 I will break it down into the simplest terms I know. 
1. Soak your hands in warm water until the skin feels soft. Not too long maybe 5 mins. 
2. Mix olive oil with some sugar to make a rough paste? and then scrub that all over ya hands. Should feel like very soft sandpaper!
1836 2018-05-31 20:27:18 By our money and our oil 
1837 2018-05-31 20:27:10 !China es feliz mandando chatarra para sur América asi rapido desaparece de Europa y Asia los diésel!Esa es su meta llenar el globo de carros eléctricos!EE.UU feliz de mandarnos oil y gasolina tiene que salir de esa carga!No mas energias fósil en el mundo! VZLA solita con su oil!
1838 2018-05-31 20:27:07 “Offshore oil spills?  Aaahhh, never could happen!  Just trust us!”
1839 2018-05-31 20:27:00 Why doesn’t he just handle with the same urgency and thought he put into the oil industry?
1840 2018-05-31 20:26:47 Time to turn off the water, oil and low cost hydro.
1841 2018-05-31 20:26:42 So in the past couple of days I've dropped & spilt cooking oil all over the kitchen & bleach on the hall carpet & now I've just spilt sugar all over the floor too.  So it took just two nights in the flat for me to become that annoying neighbour with the Hoover out after 9pm.
1842 2018-05-31 20:26:29 Try CBD oil - very affordable and effective
1843 2018-05-31 20:26:15 @BBCOne @10DowningStreet @theresa_may Any politician watching #Ambulance #BBC1 should be bloody ashamed of their selves. Key Public services in crisis. Immediate investment needed today help our already stretched amazing first responders. #NHS #POLICE #CRISIS

1845 2018-05-31 20:26:11 Such as bathing appears to you - oil, sweat, dirt, filthy water, all disgusting - so is every part of life and everything.  Marcus Aurelius
1846 2018-05-31 20:26:09 .@wagamama_uk just told me as I walked in that their #vegan fryer was broken - that's real honesty -  many restaurants would just fry it in the same oil and say nothing. Nice one, #Wagamamas!

1848 2018-05-31 20:25:42 Lavender oil works pretty well but needs to be reapplied more frequently
1849 2018-05-31 20:25:32 I use coconut oil for everything 

EVERYTHING
1850 2018-05-31 20:25:16 I wanna run a line of virgin olive oil down the back of both of your legs with a little cracked pepper anna loaf of brioche.. #Fuhgeddaboutit
1851 2018-05-31 20:25:04 I will indulge your idiocy:Expansion of the pipeline is like a concert selling out in moments. It could generate 1.1 billion dollars per year. 13-20 oil producing companies are locked into iron clad deals->80% of total capacity of expansion.There are already buyers on the table.
1852 2018-05-31 20:25:04 Apparently he frequents the same hair stylist as Don Jr.  The oil slick looked familiar.
1853 2018-05-31 20:25:03 I'm fairly certain Cookout is more akin to drinking the oil straight out of the fryer than actual food, so I see why you'd get confused
1854 2018-05-31 20:25:01 Do they have palm oil? I've yet to find a digestive that doesn't.

1858 2018-05-31 20:24:36 Naw, just as another discription of the same system. I prefer using it to Constitutional Republic because it describes more about the system itself.
1859 2018-05-31 20:24:36 man i really need some coconut oil but i b forgetting to get it every time i go in walmart

1861 2018-05-31 20:24:18 Milo likes to eat coconut oil. He shares his love for it just like his mama 
1862 2018-05-31 20:24:04 You are unacceptable as a CEO of a Texas oil company.#KinderMorgan
1863 2018-05-31 20:24:00 Also, Texas is currently riding the oil & gas boom/bust cycle up another boom period. It'll go bust sooner or later, that's a lesson all Texans learn, and then Texas will have a lot more people leaving.

Couple that with the coming ag collapse in West Texas and yeah not so good.
1864 2018-05-31 20:23:55 You got the flavored oil, girl you nasty
1865 2018-05-31 20:23:50 It is because the reason is imbalanced hormonal activity.  You should have regular healty sex. (coughing goes here)

Use pure olive oil to clean your skin.
1866 2018-05-31 20:23:31 FFs "Sterling" is dropping faster than the titanic, will soon be BELOW the euro. WE will choose whatever currency WE want to use. It will be OUR OIL, GAS, ELECTRICITY, WATER, that the UK, (whats left of it), and the E.U will need, to trade with us.
1867 2018-05-31 20:23:30 Y’all be quick to buy cars y’all can’t afford an oil change in to look like you got money rather than getting something you can actually afford. Affording a car isn’t just paying the note but maintenance and gas too.
1868 2018-05-31 20:23:26 Need an oil change $10 from every one goes to support families in our community #BasicsforBabies #medhat @CHAT945 live on location @mrlube_medhat 
1869 2018-05-31 20:23:18 So I called my car dealership to tell them I might be a few minutes late for my oil change... they kept saying I didn’t have an appointment scheduled.. I argued with them for 10 minuets to only realize I called the wrong car dealership..... 
1870 2018-05-31 20:23:16 The month began the month and ended the month with trade war concerns, but it was the best month since January.

1871 2018-05-31 20:23:07 I think I put too much oil in my hair mask last night. My sister just came and asked "is your hair wet?" She also said it looks bad. Well... atleast my hair is moisturized.
1872 2018-05-31 20:23:06 Oil price has nothing to do with poor. Middle class makes noise for them to get the subsidy benefits. It's like Lutyen media making noise on intolerance. Crop price is the real concern. Inflation has been just too low for last 4 years, which is killing the farmers.
1873 2018-05-31 20:22:49 Reasons it’s not legal, is because this plant can contribute and take over many industries. Biggest one Pharmaceutical industry, paper industry, construction industries, oil  industry, vechile manufacturing industry, textile industry and much more.
1874 2018-05-31 20:22:41 In God We Trust wasn't on the money at the founding. The law to put it on the money was signed by Eisenhower in 56. But I'll forgive the ignorance.
1875 2018-05-31 20:22:32 okay so the order for Optimal Hands is;
soak hands in warm water (how long??) > soak hands in olive oil+sugar mixture > lotion up with moisturizer?
1876 2018-05-31 20:22:17 I’d expect nothing less from a pan sexual, rar up the hoop with olive oil. @jamieoliver if you’re looking for some ideas... stand by
1877 2018-05-31 20:22:15 Sis,
 
Oil those edges.
1878 2018-05-31 20:22:14 The oil reserves were used to move folks and homes to where we grow food. #TwentyTwenty #EndOil #Decentralise #Society
1879 2018-05-31 20:22:09 Everybody act like a better car is all that comes with. I went from paying $28 for an oil change to $80 for an oil change. 
1880 2018-05-31 20:22:06 Canada can be self sufficient if we want to be. People forget that Canada is the richest in all resources. We could create so many jobs just by manufacturing all our own goods. Plenty of water, farmland, oil, forestry, cattle etc.
1881 2018-05-31 20:22:04 wow @realDonaldTrump Do you know who supplies US the most crude oil? Beware before you do something the country regrets.
1882 2018-05-31 20:22:00 TARrraRrrraArRrRaaaaaaA!! 

look how I have to go fight you now (I'm here for coconut oil slander tho)
1883 2018-05-31 20:21:58 I forgot 2 clean out my car b4 my oil change and theres paperwork everywhere.
1884 2018-05-31 20:21:46 The bear Sackerson growls in the oil behind. With that brief remark, I'll take my breath away. It is mine. I met three new friends from 1/5
1885 2018-05-31 20:21:40 Lolol now THAT is an example of sophistry.
1886 2018-05-31 20:21:37 i spent over $300 on an oil change, tire rotation and some other adult shit and this has been fun and all but i’d like to go back to being 10 yrs old pls
1887 2018-05-31 20:21:37 Did my oil change on my car  So hot outside. Fuck AZ
1888 2018-05-31 20:21:35 Scc delayed again. This is outrageous, and I now want @angusenergyplc to take this to another level. The council are actively trying to kill off the oil company because of their own interests. This is legally questionable behaviour, and Angus need to retaliate

1890 2018-05-31 20:21:33 Yeshua,  I pray your truth, your light and your revelation into the darkness of falsehoods being spoken over Zion Oil! We cancel the destructive mission that has been perpetrated by the enemy of Yahovah. We give you all praise & glory Yeshua. Amen
1891 2018-05-31 20:21:33 Yes I work mostly in oil on various surfaces. I make monotypes as well, with oil based inks and oil paint. I use water based mediums from time to time and digital applications, but oil paint has been my main thing for my whole career
1892 2018-05-31 20:21:32 This is why we need to be proactive not reactive to others moves. Lessen our reliance on The USA. Having oil n gas pipelines to the coast to sell to world markets instead of only the USA is a no brainer. Yet so many Canadians fail to see the necessity and rather fight it.
1893 2018-05-31 20:21:19 Ask him why he isn’t going after the current illegal gun holders.

1894 2018-05-31 20:21:17 And, as an added bonus, Canada can take our oil to pay for it
1895 2018-05-31 20:21:12 Do not use oil in the water when boiling pasta – it will keep the sauce from sticking to the cooked pasta #CookingwithPappardelles

1898 2018-05-31 20:20:44 Looking like Iranian proxies and Hezbollah are moving from Southern Syria and border of Israel up to Deir Ezzor province. Still waiting on Rusky confirmation. Mind you, that's where the US annihilated 200+ Russian and Russian backed mercenaries. It's the oil rich area of Syria.

1900 2018-05-31 20:20:26 I guess along with a economical logistical delivery system to get their oil out of their country they're still struggling to figure it out domestically as well.

This doesn't get brought up enough.

There are exceptions to the rule.

1932 2018-05-31 20:17:41 @lisamurkowski: Directional drilling can now reach 4,000% farther than when oil was first  produced in Alaska. We need the jobs, the revenues, and the security new oil production will provide. Our country needs the oil Alaska will provide. #OGalaska
1933 2018-05-31 20:17:41 Yes I think you're right. While I don't necessarily trust any politicians I DO trust the Scottish nation. I really truly do believe we could do things differently. We may not be as wealthy as SNP claim we will be with oil money but I'd still rather take my chances.

1947 2018-05-31 20:15:28 Gas Prices I can't understand why were exporting Oil and importing Oil from the middle east where they keep jacking up price when ever  they want to why don't we just stop exporting our oil and not import there's seems kind of stupid to me so come on my president  stop export

1951 2018-05-31 20:15:25 Must get some oil for the door.
1952 2018-05-31 20:15:16 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
1953 2018-05-31 20:15:14 On this one though, I think authorities may have nothing to do with increase. South Africans understand when fuel go up like it's currently doing. They don't blame government.

Even in their news they are always told about increments or reduction of crude oil per barrel an so on.
1954 2018-05-31 20:15:12 I have peace and harmony.  That's what our POTUS is looking for Also, he's harsh, blatantly honest, and sick and tired of the b.s.  he's not some polished TURD selling snake oil poison as soda pop.  If you backed up and took time to see the good he's done and still working on.
1955 2018-05-31 20:15:06 Whatever you do, don’t put coconut oil in your beard. If you do, there’s no hope we can bring you back to a normal life.
1956 2018-05-31 20:15:05 Yes girl! I’ve stopped using mattifying primers and powders. Mainly cuz I love a good skinlike finish, but I still don’t get super oily. I added rosehip oil into my skin routine.
1957 2018-05-31 20:15:03 I just prefer oil and vinegar on my sandwiches and salads. Valerie Jarrett is as American as any foreign born citizen. Not any sort of traitor either.
1958 2018-05-31 20:15:02 What about oil?
1959 2018-05-31 20:15:00 There is only one person on the staff of physicion holistic .com and that is lisa Fairchild she has no credentials to back up her knowledge, nothing more than a snake oil salesman.
1960 2018-05-31 20:14:42 Democratic doesn't mean pure majority rule. There are soft and hard democracies. A democratic republic only needs to be a republic where representatives are voted on. The "constitutional" demarcation only explains that central powers are separated.

1965 2018-05-31 20:14:15 I agree absolutely with the latter part. Truely disgraceful. I'm afraid I simply wouldn't rely on a Tory government to manage it.

We receive a bit more match day revenue but that is not too significant. They haven't spent oil money since Torres yet have won everything
1973 2018-05-31 20:13:41 This government just starting from the foundation. All previous government never invested money realized from oil, on infrastructures, agriculture, education or anything. They were busy looting the treasure. Only source of national income, oil. We relied on imported good and food
1974 2018-05-31 20:13:38 Deficits are exploding as predicted also, GDP is not nearly on pace to do 3+% year over year growth, and oil priced are rising fast a the ridiculously high consumer confidence has sobered. And it only to a year and a half.
1975 2018-05-31 20:13:34 Gross.  You like a guy that robs Canadian tax money to pay off a Texas oil company.  Trudeau is a corperstist whore. The same as Obama was/is.

e.g. If we do not thwart AGW, we have "no regrets" because we will have solved Peak Oil. 
i.e. We will gain either way it works out

1997 2018-05-31 20:10:37 Call me old fashioned, but I think giant corporations should be able to drill for oil wherever they want, charge whatever they want for medicine, sell guns to whoever they want, really literally anything except for cancelling Roseanne.

2000 2018-05-31 20:10:21 Not all pies have cheese, all pizzas have cheese or rare cases of oil/salt or tomatoe substitute, and have ingredients that you’d never put in a pie.

2012 2018-05-31 20:09:02 More than one descriptor can apply. You're right, but so am I. The US is a democratic republic with separated powers made up of a confederation of states. That meets the criteria for many, many descriptors in political theory.
2013 2018-05-31 20:08:49 Evangelicals have been pushing this snake oil for riches since the beginning of time.  Poor, uneducated people are prey.

2016 2018-05-31 20:08:39 Also decades of gov't subsidies (and wars) for oil interests vs gov't loans to Tesla + rebates/incentives to encourage EVs play into the political dimension.  There are many reasons one might short or buy/hold TSLA, and politics is certainly one of them.

2023 2018-05-31 20:07:53 There is a bigger picture than just oil.  Taken in it's entirety - Canada benefits massively from the previous trade deal.  The US carries way 
too much of a downside.

2029 2018-05-31 20:07:03 You're the one trying to appeal to authority, here -- and oddly, all your authorities are on oil company payrolls (or most of them).

2043 2018-05-31 20:05:09 Canada has been sending oil to the US for years discounted to the tune of $20 million per day, and US interests keep funding environmental groups to prevent new pipelines from reaching tidewater. Who’s milking who?
2044 2018-05-31 20:05:08 As we continue harvesting oil

2063 2018-05-31 20:03:11 @msnbc This is what happens when the class clown becomes the president. Trade wars that boost Russian steel and aluminum value, and hurt American jobs but help Chinese at ZTE, a Mid East policy that destabilizes oil and raises gas prices helping Russia, and pardons for liars.
2064 2018-05-31 20:03:09 For those of you blaming Brexit, we’d have been feeling the effects of Brexit from both the EU and the U.K. single market if Indy.

2065 2018-05-31 20:03:07 You can remain like that bro because of hostile ecopolitical environ, comparative disadvantage when it comes to export save for the oil you have. Rem the same pple are telling us how the world will be on clean energy, its a skewed prediction.

2072 2018-05-31 20:02:19 Except that Trump blew up air bases in Syria dummy. Not mothers/children. That would be Assad.

Additionally, it wasn't for oil or we would have taken Iraq's oil. We DIDN'T. They still own and control it. FAKE NEWS. We have plenty of our own oil.

2084 2018-05-31 20:01:12 Why can SASOL not produce oil like it did during Apartheid?
2085 2018-05-31 20:00:31 The pipeline might result in slightly increased overall production but IMO, it will more likely result in a redirection of the oil that is currently sent to US gulf at a discount. 2/
2086 2018-05-31 20:00:29 But you should be able to find it at any health food store : 100% compressed black seed oil

2088 2018-05-31 20:00:21 Not that much. US no longer needs oil from the rest of the World. They are on track to be the World's biggest producer of petroleum.
2089 2018-05-31 20:00:20 Isn’t that where you get to vote on who is a Nazi so you can be violent (release those irrational angry leftist tendencies)?
2090 2018-05-31 20:00:18 Argan oil is the holy grail for hair! You want healthy shiny hair, start with argan. I really need this because i want my hair looks super shiny and bouncy. Argan can tame splits end and boost shine. Healthy hair, happy me!

2093 2018-05-31 20:00:13 Do you know that unlike the engine oil, the transmission fluid does not all drain in the pan while changing? Most of it remains in the torque converter, valve body and transmission lines.
2094 2018-05-31 20:00:11 How do you explain 100million guns sold in the same time violence and murder decreased by more than 49%?
2095 2018-05-31 20:00:06 Maybe this NAFTA feud will now spur Canadians to support our own? . What a concept of buying our own locally raised beef, grains, dairy, and oil???!!!!  #NAFTA #BuyLocal

2098 2018-05-31 20:00:00 Wouldn't progress mean moving forward into green energy, free economies, and cleaner environments? What's progressive about the oil economy that started more than a hundred years ago?

2104 2018-05-31 19:59:16 It is because she ate them with olive oil and the real truth behind the rolls is that they are best eaten with a good salted butter.
2105 2018-05-31 19:59:12 I'm saying hydraulic fluid and crude oil are not the same substance, thus their environmental impact, on sea or land, is incomparable.
I don't follow your logic re: ferry v. Indigenous workers. Meanwhile the Indigenous communities I listen to actively oppose the pipeline.
2106 2018-05-31 19:59:11 If u really wanna tan use some baby oil and iodine
2107 2018-05-31 19:59:11 I started putting on witch hazel, aloe (100%), and rose seed oil every day and have noticed my skin has gotten so much better. Definitely recommend those three!
2108 2018-05-31 19:59:02 You've got anointing oil on your head sweethrt
2109 2018-05-31 19:58:55 Oil prices are tied into the strength of the US Dollar.  Follow the money...literally.  And Trump is a psychotic idiot regardless.
2110 2018-05-31 19:58:54 I hadn't seen they moved from Carroll Stadium to Lucas Oil.  Playing indoor on turf just as no one intended.  Carroll had its issues (and was turf as well) but man it felt like a good place for 2nd div soccer.
2111 2018-05-31 19:58:51 That may be true, but they do care about oil. At least, for now.
2112 2018-05-31 19:58:33 Lyin in Sarah’s bed nakit covered in oil to try get my tan off n she’s just flicked my nipple I feel violated

2114 2018-05-31 19:57:59 I brought my own paint pen (Sharpie oil based)
2115 2018-05-31 19:57:39 Very humid here today...headache bad.  I took 5 drops of oil, 20 min later headache gone!...no pills! yay me! 
2116 2018-05-31 19:57:29 First time I've ever been accused of being obsessive for suggesting it's not good to not eat processed foods and did I suggest anyone should avoid water, oil or soy? Have you actually read the ingredients of Oumph?
2117 2018-05-31 19:57:26 BASICALLY! And the holy earl is just olive oil from unc’s kitchen @AccidentalCajun
2118 2018-05-31 19:57:26 Olive oil , Tree tea oil , Oregano oil , coconut oil , extra virigan olive oil ... Those are ALL of the oils girls should have a large bottle of in their home. Each bottle will make your glo up as magical as possible. #Facts

2125 2018-05-31 19:56:05 Already dreading next winter's heating oil bill. Thinking of building a surplus.
2126 2018-05-31 19:56:04 What's driving the rise in oil prices?
2127 2018-05-31 19:55:59 if they keep alienating their friends it's gonna happen soon. When nobody is shipping em oil & precious resources, they won't be able to swing that dick around so much.

2129 2018-05-31 19:55:45 I just spent the last three hours waiting for an oil change. How Sway?
2130 2018-05-31 19:55:37 @jjhorgan what alternatives do you offer for moving the oil  other than through the pipe line
2131 2018-05-31 19:55:29 HOW TO BE IMPARTED:
1.Through laying of hands – Deuteronomy 34:9.
2.Through spoken words – Ezekiel 2:2.
3.Through anointing oil – Exodus 30:30.

2135 2018-05-31 19:55:08 Has anyone had luck getting grease/oil out of clothes that have already been washed and dried?  If so, HOW?!
2136 2018-05-31 19:54:45 Congratulations!  Looks like she struck oil!
2137 2018-05-31 19:54:34 I’m getting my oil changed on my car and they vacuum as well and I just realized all of my Taylor cds are spread out in the back 
2138 2018-05-31 19:54:31 @elonmusk The first billionaire in history sold us oil. The first to sold an oil-free world will be a trillionaire. You're a gift to humanity. Thanks.
2139 2018-05-31 19:54:29 Do you have roasted peanuts you can crush in your mouth with a teaspoon of oil?
2140 2018-05-31 19:54:29 How about a biiiiiig oil tarrif, to start
2141 2018-05-31 19:54:26 That's not the point you shitgibbon! The point is they are smarter than us and have more resources for their population because they don't care to make up for their small dicks with a military so they can invade countries for oil. They're still militarily powerful. Canada & AUS.
2142 2018-05-31 19:54:21 Putin’s post install instructions for Trump: 1) Eviscerate the State Department 2) Embrace me and other authoritarian rulers 3) Weaken NATO 4) Weaken economic ties to Western allies with trade wars 5) block Iranian oil on getting on the market. 6) Weaken green energy... 7)etc

2145 2018-05-31 19:53:54 You cannot profess to protect the environment shipping oil in trains.
2146 2018-05-31 19:53:39 You're already short from 62.  I said I'll other side in your amount. Look where it's been.  #oil #margincall #sticktowriting
2147 2018-05-31 19:53:33 “Nutritious”? 80% of Ghanaian meals have oil (palm or vegetable) as their base and a lot of it. And they are all accompanied by high carb sides.
2148 2018-05-31 19:53:32 Y’all expect offset to buy the man a damn wraith y’all dumb mf don’t know oil changes cost hundreds to thousands of dollars on foreign cars tires cost 300+. He bought that man something he can afford
2149 2018-05-31 19:53:21 Are you going to stop using palm oil and destroying the Borneo rain forests and killing orang-utans because it’s cheaper than finding a more ethical alternative ??
2150 2018-05-31 19:53:15 Canada has become fat and lazy and dependent on the US. Nafta has failed. Oil and gas only exported to US. Our fault. FIX IT! .. Kill NAFTA and kill other treaties with the US who is clearly no longer a special relationship and build others.
2151 2018-05-31 19:52:58 I’m putting too much pressure on this coconut oil to solve all my issues
2152 2018-05-31 19:52:57 @tomborelli more & more everyone is seeing the very real relevance of divesting & steering far away from coal/ oil/ gas. With all ur overly priced lobbying for the constant poisoning and destruction of our only world your occupation will soon be irrelevant & ur bosses out a job
2153 2018-05-31 19:52:46 So....periodically I clean out my messages...and someone asked me about CBD oil...and ummm I deleted all your messages so now I can't remember who it was that asked me about it...LOL  Message me if you are still interested.  Oopsie Poopsie! 
2154 2018-05-31 19:52:39 Game changer... the baby oil worked getting my tan off
2155 2018-05-31 19:52:33 So much for the polluter pays principle, doa. To be clear the oil producers pass the cost (carbon offsets) onto the Federal Government (tax payers) so I guy like me that meets the carbon reductions gets to share the love. Nice
2156 2018-05-31 19:52:25 Gone hiking? Natural gas and oil help you reach the summit.
2157 2018-05-31 19:52:09 happy to see Trudeau found a pair of testicles, (although they are probably borrowed from someone else) Trump is too stupid to know he needs our Oil, Lumber, Natural Resources and Metal.
2158 2018-05-31 19:52:05 Do we have any numbers on the current revenue generated from the pipeline? Do we also have any solid estimates for the future revenue of the pipeline? And what kind of price will we get for our oil from china? Havent heard anything about these important topics.
2159 2018-05-31 19:52:04 I fucking hate getting oil changes I done went cross the street & got food & all the shit still not ready 
2160 2018-05-31 19:51:54 system of representative government based on classical liberalism (the US, for example). Other denotations that can apply to the US include: presidential system, federal republic, confederation (in some legal cases), and more.
2161 2018-05-31 19:51:28 Regardless of the cause of the #NathanEStewart incident near #BellaBella it does not change the fact that over a year and half since the incident, there still remains little protections in place for the central coast when it comes to oil spill response. #Heiltsuk #bcpoli
2162 2018-05-31 19:51:19 When the oil is after our lives ! 
2163 2018-05-31 19:51:15 Let me break this down for you.

2165 2018-05-31 19:51:07 What about all the crude oil they get from us. Hey Justin. Thanks God we have you good sir. Art of the deal eh!!a. Should be a Fart and a Steal!!a
2166 2018-05-31 19:50:59 Oil was Imported by reliance for its refinery in Jam Nagar, money was paid to the UCO bank acct. Dubai and Iranian Traders imported the wheat and other animal feed and paid in Iranian Govt. in their own currency.
2167 2018-05-31 19:50:51 i tried this nail oil i bought 3 weeks ago and like it's nice and all the shit just takes too long to dry + i must use it daily i'm not ready for this commitment lmao
2168 2018-05-31 19:50:51 When I used to work at an oil change shop, the only vehicles that never had oil leaks were Mazdas. Even 2014 KIAs or Chevys would roll in with oil leaks. Mazda makes a quality vehicle
2169 2018-05-31 19:50:44 Oil is foundational to modern civilization in addition to powering it. Would rather triple  efforts to use it more wisely and use common sense, smart engineering and common purpose to save the planet instead of the hysterical zero sum game favored by anti oil True Believers.
2170 2018-05-31 19:50:43 Only been taking CBD oil for two days now but I’ve sleeping so soundly with it, and typically I wake up a lot throughout the night. So we’ll see if this continues.

2177 2018-05-31 19:49:54 Yes but that’s a big IF and would assume oil sands maintain current production levels for 150 years! It’s not as if companies are lining up to take on Oil Sands projects. The opposite has been the case with lot of majors exiting Oil Sands due to various factors. 1/
2178 2018-05-31 19:49:46 Opinion: we must help US citizens escape poverty and leave the Sudanese alone. Unless there’s oil or other natural resources that the elites are trying to rob from them I don’t know about?

2182 2018-05-31 19:49:33 I disagree. Thats your opinion many people want an alternative, or continue to eat meat. Also many people aren't as obsessive about avoiding all "processed" food. Water oil and soy is hardly a good to avoid.
One could argue it's not healthy to be so obsessed

2188 2018-05-31 19:48:55 I hesitate to call myself a self taught artist because I minored in photography during undergrad, did a year at a fine art program before that, and went to an art magnet high school. 

But... acrylic, oil, graphite, and film are the only media I've been FORMALLY trained in.
2189 2018-05-31 19:48:54 She isn't a cheesy funny person.. mayo and mates were.. oil and water don't mix well
2190 2018-05-31 19:48:54 I bet he hopes they come up with a different angle because he is frightened of what any lawsuit would do to him his company and our confidence in the uncaring oil industry.
2191 2018-05-31 19:48:48 Back In My Day, we called using sublingual pot oil to chill out "dabbing" & "getting high". Amazing to see huge numbers of facebook moms recommending it to each other while desperately insisting it is Not Marijuana and does Not Get You High lmao

2193 2018-05-31 19:48:33 i’ve actually tried conditioner but my hair is thinner so it makes it feel a bit heavy. i’ve also tried coconut oil a few times but someone told me it’s not good out in the sun? i’m not too sure though. i’ll definitely give the pillow soft one a try tho! where do i purchase?
2194 2018-05-31 19:48:31 Don’t believe the hype. Almost 100% of Costa Rica’s     are oil powered.

2201 2018-05-31 19:47:39 Hi Denise, @megan_mcnabb and I tried CBD oil & found essential oils to have stronger effects in comparison. She runs an endo support site but the oil education is universal and we’d love to help you find more natural solutions if you’re open
2202 2018-05-31 19:47:26 Looking through legislative campaign finance reports, looks like oil and gas companies decided to give to candidates in both parties in the last couple of weeks. #nmpol #nmleg
2203 2018-05-31 19:47:18 If stocks are falling. Does oil go down or will it stay stable or go higher?

2206 2018-05-31 19:47:15 Venezuela wouldn't have oil would it and its downtrodden people elected a left wing government. People who vote left are being targeted for having the audacity to stand up to crooks like Bill Browder. The Maginsky Act - Begind The Scenes watch.

2212 2018-05-31 19:46:47 Dear mr Trudeau why doesn’t Canada cut all hydro power and oil going to the states until America cuts out this bs trade Tariffs on Canadian goods
2213 2018-05-31 19:46:30 I test the quality of steel pipe in oil wells. (tubing). The newest pipe (imported) in the ground is of poor quality and has to be thrown away.Steel that has been in the ground for over a decade(American)still tests at an optimal level and goes back in the ground. US steel best
2214 2018-05-31 19:46:29 Yep, totally. If state run utilities are managed correctly they work. Gas, leccy, new energy, rail, etc should all be state owned/run.
We read reports from Denmark etc and they have it as right as poss. Dodgey Dave even said it. "Only 5M people, as much oil as us". £1Trill kitty!

2217 2018-05-31 19:46:09 I went to grab a water off my dresser and took a huge, HUGE sip...it was my essential oil water for my diffuser!!!! IF I DIE, IT WAS GREAT YALL!!!
2218 2018-05-31 19:46:05 I love tuna, red onion and leafy green salad with a little olive oil
2219 2018-05-31 19:46:04 Go get some peppermint oil!
2220 2018-05-31 19:45:56 @realDonaldTrump Maybe we (Canadians) will stop selling oil and gas to the U.S.  We'd rather deal with China anyway.
2221 2018-05-31 19:45:51 my next nsfw idea for personal art/writing:
- massage with oil
- "im not a prostitue but we can pretend i am for you"
- succubus who cannot be touched but she pleases herself around other demons 

after stopping to draw nsfw for starngers i feel much inspired
2222 2018-05-31 19:45:46 not the canola oil 
2223 2018-05-31 19:45:44 It would be great to see the wheels fall off #Chelsea so they go back to their level! It’s a bit like a chav winning the lottery and spending all of the money they’ve won! You can’t buy class not even with dirty oil money!!
2224 2018-05-31 19:45:44 This will not be a recession- this will be a massive crash right into the ground like an bomb coming down from 30K feet. The tariff business + the migrant worker policies + oil $ + banking regulation destruction is going 2 b fuel for the Trump nuclear explosion
2225 2018-05-31 19:45:33 Dreamers keep knocking oil. while Canada’s largest Oil/Gasoline market Ont & Que buy Tanker Oil from Venezuela’s Killer Dictator, Saudi Sheiks who treat women like property, Africa & USA. All with terrible Enviro Regs. Alberta’s can only sell to USA who sell it back to us. Crazy!

2229 2018-05-31 19:45:20 Alright, so my oil change is free. Finally, some type of silver lining.
2230 2018-05-31 19:45:18 Market hasn't moved much since mid-April, but there's been tons of dispersion under the surface. 

First tech/semis, then energy/oil, then banks, now retail/consumer.
2231 2018-05-31 19:45:16 2yr old oil dit gaan nie lekker smaak nie
2232 2018-05-31 19:45:14 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
2233 2018-05-31 19:45:13 Idk how people can do oil free diets bc I use soooooo much olive oil in almost everything whoops
2234 2018-05-31 19:45:13 Mix olive oil, castor oil, an avocado, an egg and some honey.. massage it into your scalp and sleep with it overnight and wash it out. It makes my scalp feel sooooo refreshed  I try to do it once a week!

2238 2018-05-31 19:44:41 The highest  "Pork " content I can find is 40% for the large ones and 26% for the small ones - so basically it  shouldn't really be defined as a" meat product" at all, instead its a carb/ seed oil product with meat attached lol
2239 2018-05-31 19:44:40 fracking?..isn't that a way to extract oil? ..I didn't know there was oil drilling on the islands..who would think that is safe?
2240 2018-05-31 19:44:35 but still, EVs energy comes from wind, solar, hydro, nuclear, oil, biogas, coal, whatever you want/need. it's a choice. that's the main point about ev's.
2241 2018-05-31 19:44:28 @mrshll1001 Can you recommend a nice beard oil ? For @Divideddarko
2242 2018-05-31 19:44:23 It’s sooo good!! Just cut them up, salt pepper and flour and fry!  you can use olive oil to make it a little more healthy lol

2245 2018-05-31 19:43:53 @JustinTrudeau can we please tax our oil exports to America,  please do something to defend us against this tyrant. Make him and the citizens of that shithole country pay for his dumbfuck policies
2246 2018-05-31 19:43:41 Thanks for the reply. You did excellent job on the aftermath, but missed the roots. Diverting from Sep 11 main goals to oil, golan heights security - Salafi Jihadis were trained against secular Syria by west- they became IS later. The snake bit the snakecharmer. World paid price.

2252 2018-05-31 19:43:28 I pulled into Vavoline like listen..... I ONLY want an oil change. I know I need other stuff done but that’s all we doing today. Don’t try to get me to do ANYTHING else  Now... how you doin’ today?
2253 2018-05-31 19:43:23 Is it true that India produced huge quantity of petrol and diesel from Crude Oil in last quarter and also increased price of petrol and diesel to achieve higher GDP rate in last quarter?
2254 2018-05-31 19:43:19 Whole egg mixed with two spoons of virgin olive oil...apply to hair, cover with a shower cap or anything air tight, leave for 2hours, shampoo and air dry.
2255 2018-05-31 19:43:19 Yes, they would urinate on an electric fence right under the sign warning of it and blame the farmer who put the fence up, not their own stupidity.
2256 2018-05-31 19:43:03 A friend said to me that Joe Wicks looks so toned blah blah blah and he eats buckets of coconut oil. Yeah, but you can't see in his arteries, can you?
2257 2018-05-31 19:42:55 Exactly! Oil change probably $200
2258 2018-05-31 19:42:44 So, big talking Liberal government not only defending steel industry (5% of global carbon emissions) but owns a pipeline leading directly from the dirtiest oil on the planet. How does this jive with their “economy and environment go hand in hand” bullshit?
2259 2018-05-31 19:42:43 First of all, just what we need, another animal killer in Interior. Secondly, Trump could care less about the people, and Zinke only cares about bribes from oil and mining lobby
2260 2018-05-31 19:42:39 Needs must! I also find No 7 Dry Body Oil amazing in a pinch.
2261 2018-05-31 19:42:24 This guy is a snake oil salesmen. You don’t have patients because you’re not doctors. Plus not sure how a guy with a belly is going to tell people how to be fit.
2262 2018-05-31 19:42:18 Does anyone have any experience with CBD oil in treating anxiety?

2264 2018-05-31 19:41:46 Remove the palm oil from all your products
2265 2018-05-31 19:41:32 Hi Amy, We have RSPO (Segregated) Palm Oil in our jar recipe, but no palm oil in the squeezy recipe. We keep trying ones without and they just don’t taste right. We’ll keep trying!
2266 2018-05-31 19:41:27 It is now officially 'liquid coconut oil season', in Ireland! Its scorchio!

2268 2018-05-31 19:41:11 Spent almost $100 for an oil change and a HALF full tank of gas I’m purchasing a bike.

2270 2018-05-31 19:40:19 Oil/gas on the rise

2272 2018-05-31 19:40:15 Heck silver looks great on you! I promise you your hair won’t be that healthy looking once it’s dyed unless you put a whole lot of effort and money into it. If you’re on a budget the cheapest thing to spruce up your hair after bleach is egg and olive oil.
2273 2018-05-31 19:40:14 @RichieAllenShow So the Russians said nothing cause at the time the USA was helping with turbine tech to help with an oil pipeline to Germany. They really needed this money.

2277 2018-05-31 19:39:48 He thought for a second and put lots of oil on the ground before striking a match and throwing it in the big puddle he made. It made an explosion.. Maybe not as big as Bakugou's... But it was impressive for household items

2280 2018-05-31 19:39:37 Seriously, it would be useful.  As a Canadian its just allowing our Federal Government to impose more stupid policies and we just bought an oil pipeline yesterday...
2281 2018-05-31 19:39:25 Iran deal has been in effect until last month. OPEC will take advantage at every opportunity. This is why USA oil production is so important. Something O fought. Progressives support OPEC.
2282 2018-05-31 19:39:11 This week the govt paid Rs 50 billion to IPPs, Gencos, Oil & Gas companies to reduce circular debt. This today stands at Rs 397 b. Another Rs 50 b approved by ECC will be paid in days. After that the power sector debt will be below Rs 350 b which is the normal limit for debt.
2283 2018-05-31 19:39:10 Anything that doesn’t have a gallon of oil or your spit in it.
2284 2018-05-31 19:39:09 Just wait for the Canadian oil tariffs coming.
2285 2018-05-31 19:39:09 That wasn’t directed at you dear. You chose to get defensive and butt hurt. But you do you.
2286 2018-05-31 19:39:04 try making your own exfoliating mask using

-coconut oil

2287 2018-05-31 19:38:59 I would think you have more important issues to tweet about:
1. Trade tariffs. 2. Alienating our allies. 3. Nuclear deal. 4. Oil prices. 5. Obstruction of justice. 6. Attacks on FBI and Justice. 7. Death toll in Puerto Rico.
2288 2018-05-31 19:38:56 If I said democracy, then that's my mistake. But it is a democratic republic. That doesn't mean it isn't a constitutional republic.

2292 2018-05-31 19:38:39 I need an oil change but I also need new clothes. Decisions decisions.
2293 2018-05-31 19:38:35 It’s not pretentious to be civil or show common courtesy. But you don’t know anything about that do you. Your tweets make that obvious.
2294 2018-05-31 19:38:08 UHM HELLO the act of using a dowsing rod to find oil is called Doodlebugging and that’s all I have to say
2295 2018-05-31 19:38:05 Yes, of course.
Palm oil and its production must be stopped.
It is bad for animals.
Bad for the environment.
Bad for people.

2311 2018-05-31 19:36:20 With the way some girls like cars you may think they were breastfed with engine oil.
2312 2018-05-31 19:36:02 I worked in the oil & has sector then transferred to HE. 30 years ago you got a degree and went in to an industry training programme
2313 2018-05-31 19:35:56 have you ever tried CBD oil for that ?
2314 2018-05-31 19:35:51 Just like the old study it looks at cooking cleaning and laundry, what if I did a study that ONLY aked about lawn mowing changing car oil and fixing plumbing... what do you imagine the results might be...?
2315 2018-05-31 19:35:44 You don't do maintenance on Siberian oil fields for 16 months - you end up losing capacity. New projects are raring to go
2316 2018-05-31 19:35:33 Where does a person buy oil paints?
2317 2018-05-31 19:35:31 if it was oil-based, coating your hands in oil might help too, if you use dish liquid to get it off?
2318 2018-05-31 19:35:25 What can I say...don’t watch the show then.  What I’m saying is equating this to the Roseanne Barr situation is faulty logic.
2319 2018-05-31 19:35:01 Well, it’s not going to get better. Big oil, gas, and coal, etc...donate to politics on both sides of the aisles. And they’d rather have campaigns financed than worry about the earth. I’m sad about that, too. I’m sad a lot.
2320 2018-05-31 19:34:57 @forduk @FordService_UK had car serviced in Feb, 3 months later, low oil & turbo problems. Did you really replace oil? No issues in previous year with low oil! #coincidence?
2321 2018-05-31 19:34:55 also why do olives exist except for in oil darth i will never understand
2322 2018-05-31 19:34:51 first line, first error - IT WAS NOT AN ELECTION 

3rd Paragraph, second errir - No, the crisis is not because of the price of oil, otherwise ALL oil countries would be in the same shit.

And even though the number of cooperatives exploded -  they were often Corrupt... BINGO!

2326 2018-05-31 19:34:34 The other thing that surprised me about Italians is they use very few, very high quality ingredients. So a Neopolitan Margherita pizza really is just dough, passata, cheese, basil, and some oil. We want to put so much into a sauce, but they really focus.

2348 2018-05-31 19:31:41 And ask how many *consumers* do. Since fruit and vegetables aren’t unique to vegans. People seem to think we don’t know or care about monocultures, palm oil, non-native bee transportation...

2359 2018-05-31 19:30:42 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
2360 2018-05-31 19:30:42 Prime Minister--If you want to fight climate change, please leave your oil in the ground.  Instead of spending 4.5 bn on a leaky pipeline, give rebates for citizens buying EVs.  Further invest in your solar and wind industry.  Oil is dead...or we are.
2361 2018-05-31 19:30:36 I think @PatUnleashed needs a full-time “Alex Jones Deciphering Associate”, and I’d be willing to take this on. However, I must admit, I’m a #millenial and have not been graced with the ability to oil paint.

2366 2018-05-31 19:30:24 With oil getting more expensive, and potential for metals price inflation (tariffs and all that) you'd expect they'll struggle with their gross margin a lot.
2367 2018-05-31 19:30:21 We got the oil.  Don't worry.  We have pizza and beer.

2371 2018-05-31 19:30:07 Africa, as formerly in Iraq is getting too late to grab at any time. And it is. The increasing oil price will probably kill The Great
2372 2018-05-31 19:29:58 You don’t need to be a dude to use beard oil!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2373 2018-05-31 19:29:40 Because you haven't had CBD oil in your life!
2374 2018-05-31 19:29:39 Of course you have to be more careful if pregnant! Hygiene is important! I have completed menue frozen and just have to unfreeze to feed. Put some oil in and ready. 
2375 2018-05-31 19:29:37 The videos I be seeing of how these niggas perform?!? Like ma’am you spent your hard earned dollar bills to be harassed and go home with endless baby oil stains on your good going out clothes???

2379 2018-05-31 19:29:11 I do drink craft beer, but more importantly I make money selling craft beer to all the dudes with man buns and use beard oil. And just to clarify once again, I’M A GIRL!!!
2380 2018-05-31 19:29:04 Theme of the conference: lots and lots of actors in development these days! US military, multinational oil companies, etc. If this is the new reality, how do we go forward without forgetting what our goals are? Very mixed feelings. #SIDWConference
2381 2018-05-31 19:28:51 White knighting? D.M. has been disagreeing with me. I just don't like seeing people pretend they're smarter or better because they choose to impose weird puritan censorship on themselves.
2382 2018-05-31 19:28:50 Russia in 8th place? Hardly. Unless they find lots of new oil deposits. Or Russia will unleash the 3rd World War to sell more weapons.
2383 2018-05-31 19:28:48 I prepared hair oil using hemp and my whole house stinks

2389 2018-05-31 19:27:50 If it were up to Kurt there would be thriving whaling towns in New England and we'd be lighting our homes with whale blubber based oil. Because progress can't leave certain geographic areas behind in Trumpism or something.
2390 2018-05-31 19:27:49 Would Fried chicken taste weird in olive oil?
2391 2018-05-31 19:27:33 got oil on my satin pants 
2392 2018-05-31 19:27:26 .. Why tf does everywhere but Ireland have Sephora? I'm trying out the kat von d one which is actually really good? It dries down and actually won't budge unless you use oil to remove it. The anastasia one is supposed to be good too? I've never used it though.
2393 2018-05-31 19:27:24 Rose fragrance oil is seductive.
2394 2018-05-31 19:27:22 Car insurance should cover anything that needs done to your car. So that means oil changes, brakes, flat tires, cracks in the windshield, all that shit. They got us paying $2400+ per year for car insurance. That some of us never use. It’s a rip off.
2395 2018-05-31 19:27:21 Wasn’t trying to start a thing, and don’t know him/his actions beyond his conf comments. So not defending him.

But more generally, assuming a subjective preference comment is “b/c oil and gas” seems about as fair as someone judging your EV dedication by your racing profession.
2396 2018-05-31 19:27:17 More lies and deceit from the original climate con Al Gore. Meanwhile in the USA 2.1 million barrels per day exported overseas. The US is now a leading exporter of oil. I can physically taste the hypocrisy.
2397 2018-05-31 19:27:15 Cannabis oil where are you
2398 2018-05-31 19:27:06 Just roasted some almonds and tossed with olive oil and Old Bay Seasoning. Snacking win! #MarylandBorn
2399 2018-05-31 19:26:59 Worldwide, the renewable energy sector is employing more people than oil. Increase investment to transitioning workers into those sectors and watch employment really take off.
2400 2018-05-31 19:26:47 Battershit seems to think that only home grown cannabis can be legally altered into edibles, as opposed to store bought bud or oil. This is really painful.
2401 2018-05-31 19:26:47 The oil & NG production glut in USA—mostly by US multinationals & foreign co in USA—

2411 2018-05-31 19:25:43 Medical isotopes, oil and gas, Wheat it adds up to more than 300 billion in canadian goods. Let’s see you get the joke. It’s your president.
2412 2018-05-31 19:25:26 We saw this with oil & NG in 2008:  $150 oil wasn’t due to increased demand—b/c our & the world’s economies were slowing down, not overheating.

$150 oil & $13 NG were due to price manipulation....
2413 2018-05-31 19:25:17 Early morning spliff dey confuse you?
2414 2018-05-31 19:25:07 When I regained consciousness from alcohol asphyxiation, I put all that stuff in the blender on high, it's eating holes in the cloth.  Dab, dab whoops!  Kidding. I used my magical shark steamer, and it came out with just water.  Thank you!   The baby oil worked on my face.

2417 2018-05-31 19:24:56 yet another promise completely ignored.
 we were promised Federal Proportional Representation.
we were promised Ending Oil Subsidies, they just handed over 4.5b.
they are promising to protect the coast. I have zero faith in that statement.
2418 2018-05-31 19:24:55 Petronas makes money. High profit, high tax. Company makes money for shareholders. They are owned by Malaysia. Petronas makes much money from selling oil since day 1. Where do you think they get the oil from? Magic? Dtg dari bumi Malaysia. The word steal doesnt apply here

2420 2018-05-31 19:24:36 #tarriffs #tradewar #NAFTA. Non trade sanctions are needed against US. Retaliation hurts Canadian  families. Stage a Pipeline problem.

2421 2018-05-31 19:24:31 Okay though if you want to play dirty,
-Harley claims to be democrat and has given thousands of dollars to Rs up through 2016
-Harley claims to be an environmentalist and has hundreds of thousands invested in offshore oil drilling
Hans doesn’t lie, doesn’t bs like that
2422 2018-05-31 19:24:23 I be happy to rub oil you
2423 2018-05-31 19:24:14 Selling out our military to fill his donors coffers, selling off our national parks to cronies in the mining and oil business.  Donald Trump is a traitor to the United States.  He didn’t make anything GREAT. He makes everything FAIL
2424 2018-05-31 19:24:08 Not very original. Instead of simply matching what they do, think outside the box and be creative. Surely there is an alternative to hit them hard. Maybe build a fucking pipeline and quit giving them a massive discount on our oil for starters!
2425 2018-05-31 19:23:59 I thought fracking in the US was only financially viable if the price of crude was $55 or higher, their break even price. Surely if crude oil carries on its upward spiral, the Yanks will start fracking again?
2426 2018-05-31 19:23:58 ...ahhh good question... I think they would go for it... when one sees what all they have already put on the list sacrificing it all for extracting wealth --oil etc
2427 2018-05-31 19:23:49 got an oil change earlier and the guy offered to vacuum my floors lmao he finished and told me i had enough weed to roll a couple blunts 
2428 2018-05-31 19:23:38 Hypocrisy #CherryPoint 60 miles south is an oil export facility    @nspector4 The Cherry Point Refinery, owned by BP, is the largest oil refinery in Washington. It is located about 7 mi south of Blaine and 8 mi northwest of Ferndale, a few miles south of the Canada–US border
2429 2018-05-31 19:23:29 Utakuwa fossil. They will name some new type of crude oil after u 
2430 2018-05-31 19:23:25 I do believe in the power of boycott. It's a powerful tool we have in our box that we never use. Want gas for $2.00? Stay off the roads every weekend for three months. Gas is a waste product of oil processing. Much like skim milk; all the fat removed. True!
2431 2018-05-31 19:23:08 Pointing out the truth doesn’t make me full of myself. It makes me full of truth. But do white knight some more.
2432 2018-05-31 19:22:45 Thanks for the reply. You did excellent job on the aftermath, but missed the roots. Diverting from Sep 11 main goals to oil, golan heights security - Salafi Jihadis were trained against secular Syria by west- they became IS later. The snake bit the snakecharmer. World paid price.

I spread a dollop of aloe vera on dry hair, from scalp to ends. Aloe can be drying, so if you have dry hair, put a little argan oil on the ends.
2437 2018-05-31 19:22:13 Is it a legal obligation to have fox news on every automotive service waiting room? I just want an oil change, not a headache.
2438 2018-05-31 19:22:13 or, hey, how about they don't and you can focus on what Texans, rather than oil companies, want?
2439 2018-05-31 19:22:11 Oil price has gone up lately, also worthwhile to note gold trade, otherwise the deficit would not be this bad but be still bad because there are clear signs deterioration in core indicators too.

2462 2018-05-31 19:19:38 You should try coconut oil - virgin coconut oil hard pressed organic and take a teaspoon four times a day. It works wonders. And all the cravings come from having too much candida in the body - coconut oil helps in eliminating them.
2463 2018-05-31 19:19:37 @SenateMajLdr I'am asking you to please help the lower/middle class hard working American's out to stop Big Oil Company's higher prices during summer months. This means our children have to do without something due to having to pay higher prices at the pump. Please help us?
2464 2018-05-31 19:19:36 Do some reading. Canada doesn't sell volume like China. They make products for a buck a day. However, we are the biggest oil imports to the US along with natural resources of all kinds.

2469 2018-05-31 19:18:59 Niger delta is a location. Niger delta people refers to the indigenes of that location. It's not the oil that gave them the name. It's the area. Kaji?
2470 2018-05-31 19:18:57 Stayed in an apartment in Dubrovnik last year; wine, figs, grapes, water, olive oil and walnut liqueur all gifted and mostly home produced from the owners farm. Brought my own tea (Yorkshire Gold) with me though.

2484 2018-05-31 19:17:26 Learn from a sicilian guy: short pasta (as fusilli or such)+frijoles negros+pico de gallo+olive oil = superdish! A kind of summer salad but a complete dish also. 
2485 2018-05-31 19:17:21 If you're a fan of Glenn's, you're a follower of a one of the most mendacious snake oil salesmen of them all.
2486 2018-05-31 19:17:16 Oh yes !!! 
2487 2018-05-31 19:17:06 Will there be ladies on the boat? Boozing? Or you steaming to talk oil prices?
2488 2018-05-31 19:16:55 Little Red Car (tentatively named Pepper) will hopefully be out of the shop tomorrow after a couple days of flushings, an oil change and some replaced tie rods. So excited to start an adventure with it. But mostly just ready to get rid of the Buick.
2489 2018-05-31 19:16:52 Luke hella doesn't spoil me and buy me shit like clothes or movie dates. However he is always helping me out with much more meaningful and useful things. He just got me an oil change, air filter, and wiper blades  shit like that means so much to me! #brokebitch
2490 2018-05-31 19:16:48 My house smell is a fight between a beautiful lemon and peppermint essential oil scent and crockpot chicken.
2491 2018-05-31 19:16:47 Eco styler (argon oil) + Hicks = a bombbbbbbb combo for this summer heat and humidity 
2492 2018-05-31 19:16:38 @sainsburys what a waste of money. Two taste the difference tuna steaks bought this evening now in the bin. Stank of cod liver oil on opening and a wash didn’t help. Cooked them but utterly disgusting #tunanotcodliver
2493 2018-05-31 19:16:35 Distinction without a difference.
2494 2018-05-31 19:16:32 )1How about asbestos free NYCHA .2) How about Rat free NYCHA.3)How about adding more staff..4)HOW about some new windows or new cabinets or oil free paint!!!!WTF YOU GOT A BUNCH OF OTHER PROBLEMS TO WORRY ABOUT THEN TENANTS SMOKING NYCHA GET YOU SHIT IN ORDER
2495 2018-05-31 19:16:32 Dang, welp gotta find a new oil
2496 2018-05-31 19:16:28 I legit will not go anywhere but Toyota for my oil changes. Idc if it costs more.
Let me tell you about that idiot that put the oil filter on wrong with the Chevy I had... can’t have that happening with a Toyota engine.
2497 2018-05-31 19:16:23 So far today:

- Trade war with our closest allies is reinstituted
- A self-admitted felon is pardoned for overtly political reasons
- Fat-45 threatens to ban auto imports from Germany
- Oil still trading at nearly double 18 months ago

Putin probably peed himself he's so happy.
2498 2018-05-31 19:16:18 The petroleum is already getting shipped to port by rail.  Pipeline replaces rail. BC is not stopping oil from being processed, it is forcing the oil to be shipped by more hazardous means
2499 2018-05-31 19:16:04 Don't get the surgery, cod liver oil is your friend 
2500 2018-05-31 19:16:04 When it's pay day tomorrow but u gotta pay rent, car payment, insurance, yo phone bill, and now u need an oil change  yaaaaay for being an adult.
2501 2018-05-31 19:16:03 @realDonaldTrump you are a one term president if you don't get the gasoline prices down the oil and utility companies are getting all our tax break; not good, no not good. The base will be gone with the wind.
2502 2018-05-31 19:16:01 I just shaved my legs with coconut oil and couldn’t get out of the bathtub bc everything was slippery 
2503 2018-05-31 19:15:59 They do hybrids of this oil. They can add or remove THC. It all depends on your pain and if you can use the THC as well. I can’t use the THC.
2504 2018-05-31 19:15:55 Royal Purple Oil only. 
2505 2018-05-31 19:15:53 Check your Engine oil this Sunday.
2506 2018-05-31 19:15:52 Lol "reflexive profanity." I prefer to call it honest communication.
Playing at being better than someone doesn't actually make you better than them.
2507 2018-05-31 19:15:45 Grapefruit and water so far. About to make oatmeal w/ flax, chia, honey and coconut/olive oil
2508 2018-05-31 19:15:33 Tried fish and chips, cause I heard good things, one of the worst, fish was old and overcooked, oil was rancid.  I did give a second chance on fries, oil was clean, I would give 9/10, but go to @EvansSeafoods for much better.
2509 2018-05-31 19:15:33 We are a Constitutional republic founded on the principles of Federalism. But you do you.
2510 2018-05-31 19:15:28 I mainly eat Brussels sprouts, cauliflower broccoli mushrooms and chicken thigh, a little bit of seaweed, some olive oil and mct oil. I use chicken broth to boil the Brussels sprouts and sometimes just a bowl of broth soup. It is a good weight loss diet actually lol
2511 2018-05-31 19:15:26 For better clarity avail us of data of foreign reserve and oil output on those periods
2512 2018-05-31 19:15:20 "4,702 mile road trip ahead. Gonna need an oil change.."
2513 2018-05-31 19:15:17 Does anyone believe that the oil industry pollution cap put in place by the #abndp govt would not be reversed once Kenney gets elected?? cdnpoli Yet the 
Liberals keep referring to this piece of public policy as if it means something. #stopKM
2514 2018-05-31 19:15:15 Yes, Imagine oil dropping sub 50 in a floating regime. Every1 in Nigeria dies bar none. runaway inflation & unprecedented currency debasement that no amount of interest rate hikes can help. Also imagine the avengers making things worse. That ur fixed salary eh just think zimbabwe
2515 2018-05-31 19:15:07 Water, Soya Protein Concentrate (20%), Sunflower Oil
Is all it contains except the seasonings/herbs
2516 2018-05-31 19:15:00 Is book value going obsolete as a value metric?

The accounting rules around expensing costs that add value for years to come says so.  Brand recognition advertising, research and development, and the intangible expenses when drilling and completing an oil well are a few examples
2517 2018-05-31 19:14:59 He can always get a berth on an oil rig. He loves fossil fuels does Nige.
2518 2018-05-31 19:14:54 #TheQueenMzansi Shaka and Church...Water and Oil
2519 2018-05-31 19:14:46 If you have to eat them, toss in wok with light oil and red pepper seeds. Or go to Chinese buffet.
2520 2018-05-31 19:14:44 I'll get the baby oil 
2521 2018-05-31 19:14:44 Every day at 3 pm I get a message in my work email listing the spam it's caught in the past 24 hours. Today's first entry in that list is from "Jesus Oil".
2522 2018-05-31 19:14:44 That’s what I’m doing. I gotta get off here. I’m not talking about this anymore. I’ve already had two certified people tell me to go to the dispensary and get the oil. I can’t take THC because I’m sober. They have plants that are now 90% CBD so they are still working on it.
2523 2018-05-31 19:14:36 cbd oil and using a menstrual cup has significantly lowered my pain from endo. also avoiding soy based foods has helped a lot!
2524 2018-05-31 19:14:27 Oil prices skyrocketing
2525 2018-05-31 19:14:26 Norway's interesting. Where socialism also gets you a $1,000,000,000,000 fund from oil royalties.
2526 2018-05-31 19:14:23 But more power to her, the televangelist, Trump and all those selling snake oil to their respective constitutents while they laugh their way to the bank.  That’s America.
2527 2018-05-31 19:14:23 Oh look the Texas oil company had its drop dead decision date (May 31) on the pipeline on exactly the same day as the American NAFTA trade war steel tariff expiration date (May 31). 

I’m sure that’s a total coincidence and NAFTA had nothing to do with any of this. Nothing at all
2528 2018-05-31 19:14:13 Hilarious how "deist" is always their feeble retort, even as they (i) clearly have no idea what a deist actually is and (ii) have no clue the Founders were, almost to a man, proto-Unitarians. (And the standard, childish, reflexive profanity? Just the icing on their stupid cake.)
2529 2018-05-31 19:14:12 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump 

Mr. President,

Consider helping the Iranian people by supplying oil to India during  the trucker strike.

#IranStrikes #Iran #FreeIran
2530 2018-05-31 19:14:11 to be fair high maintenance costs are only if you take it in for services and such. my baby costs 30$ more an oil change when I do the labor. that being said, if you are prepared to do any labor it will cost a lot more yes.
2531 2018-05-31 19:14:09 In some cases, yes, but we're pretty much out of indigenous oil. And we're not going to be growing our own coffee or oranges.
2532 2018-05-31 19:14:02 and the oil industry has known it for years.
2533 2018-05-31 19:14:00 Reminder: Silver now cheaper relative to mining cost,than when it was 13s in late 2015. Much cheaper. Oil was about 1/2 this price $SLV $GLD
2534 2018-05-31 19:13:50 mark  everything up dollar for dollar they add tarrifs on, they need our steel, they need our wood, and our oil.
2535 2018-05-31 19:13:46 Now you're cooking with barbecue oil!

Blue robes, pointy hats with stars, giant gammon effigies, chants of "Kill the ham, keep the kilogram!" or "Delete the meat, before Brexit is complete!"
2536 2018-05-31 19:13:43 What essential oil would go well in a lotion to sooth heat rash/sun poisoning and stop the burning itch?
2537 2018-05-31 19:13:40 I think so. Denuclearize first, then we can kill you and let our oil companies move in. Al Qaida welcome.
2538 2018-05-31 19:13:39 going to the beach on tuesday bitch i need to sit in the sun and to be rubbed down in oil YOU DON’T UNDERSTAND IT’S HOW I LIVE
2539 2018-05-31 19:13:37 Where is my holy oil
2540 2018-05-31 19:13:34  hope you remember that I am older than you are
2541 2018-05-31 19:13:30 What does everyone think about CBD oil? Anyone use it?
2542 2018-05-31 19:13:26 Mr Trudeau - financing an oil pipeline across pristine wilderness is unacceptable and will have a huge impact on the longevity of species in these areas. PLEASE RECONSIDER.
2543 2018-05-31 19:13:14 Yep, it's all the off shore oil transfers, if it doesn't land here - no tax, so it goes to other ports where tax levels are more appealing.

2546 2018-05-31 19:13:00 Never said it was a democracy. I said it was a democratic republic. It is. Insisting that this is inaccurate doesn't magically make it inaccurate. You can call it a constitutional republic, but you'd just be describing a republic with a constitution, not the system.
2547 2018-05-31 19:12:52 did your party  has any suggestions to the government to control on oil prices?.common man looking for the reduction in oil prices.request your action on it.Thanks.
2548 2018-05-31 19:12:43 This evening... homemade sweet potato and carrot soup, with fresh garlic, ginger and chilli, plus small splah of soy sauce, a little coconut oil and teaspoon of chia seeds. Served with 3 oatcakes & goats cheese #goodmoodfood #selfcare #alreadyfeeldifferent #namaste

2552 2018-05-31 19:12:27 So after today's free lunch of "Pounded yam and egusi with 2 gorgeous meat" I stained my white top with oil as per a foodie dat I am. But nothing must spoil my fine girl, I covered it perfectly as per d fashion boss ti mo je 
2553 2018-05-31 19:12:26 Are you against oil?
2554 2018-05-31 19:12:16 Yes but you gotta take the other route; we are less dependent on foreign oil
2555 2018-05-31 19:12:09 Ok to sell snake oil to the desperate.
2556 2018-05-31 19:12:07 So one tap (oil) will turn on the other (money). Why would we not want to sell oil? Alt fuels are just not ready for prime time. Thanks.
2557 2018-05-31 19:11:44 OMG! how deep was that thing set? Did you strike oil?
2558 2018-05-31 19:11:41 Coconut oil will really have your skin glowing!! I need to start back using it
2559 2018-05-31 19:11:38 Mine came in a little tin with a pair of curved scissors and beard oil. It was a damn sweet present.
2560 2018-05-31 19:11:32 I’m so old my first iPhone charger ran on whale oil.
2561 2018-05-31 19:11:07 By our Money, don’t freakin forget that !
Even our oil we’re not benefiting from, remember Halliburton !!!? 
Saving Kuwait has a very good paycheck for the allies to liberate Kuwait !
Do you want more !!!? 
2562 2018-05-31 19:11:02 Waiting to get an oil change so for my very few followers, I wanna talk about masculinity and my personal journey with my sexuality
2563 2018-05-31 19:10:55 If I’ve still got fake tan on after drowning myself in baby oil I’ll cry
2564 2018-05-31 19:10:48 How about we stop using crude oil? There really isn't much of a need for it. These oil companies have been buying non-oil technology to stop competition.
2565 2018-05-31 19:10:42 Bro,answer my question
Do we hv the infrastructure in place for non cnvntnl energy??
Does Union budget has any proposal ??
which is the source u are currently using??
Are we able to meet the current needs without oil now??
2566 2018-05-31 19:10:18 @POTUS Thank you so much all you have done for American's and this country. I do appreciate. However, I think their needs to be more done for lower/middle class working class voter's. Like stopping Oil Company's from gauging working class American's at the gasoline pumps.
2567 2018-05-31 19:10:09 I don't even have a lamp oil to lose, but i've still decided that im the king!

2569 2018-05-31 19:10:04 Just when Canada thought they couldn't hate @POTUS @realDonaldTrump more....
Guess it's time to stop sending electricity, oil, and lumber over. Get your own sources, asshole.

2571 2018-05-31 19:09:38 Yeah but it’s not a bad thing even with that improvement in the world.. Things like oil where we get tied into deals because they are the only market. I say work with China in anticipation of their eclipsing of the USA
2572 2018-05-31 19:09:37 You forgot beard oil
2573 2018-05-31 19:09:36 Natural resources is one of the largest industries in this country. Oil, mining, forestry, water, etc etc

2576 2018-05-31 19:09:27 The best way to get back at us would be to refuse to pipe that tar sand shit oil throughout the United States.
2577 2018-05-31 19:09:23 Agreed....but could make a huge profit on those players now so must be decent. I’m sure you thought City bought players pre oil money who were good business / good signings when you never used to win even a tea cup.
2578 2018-05-31 19:09:22 I love him ororo nobe crude oil
2579 2018-05-31 19:09:17 Please @DineshDSouza you are as bad as obama and his gang. You are a lying snake oil salesman and a pardon does not mean you were innocent. I am a Trump supporter but you are a horrible dangerous person.
2580 2018-05-31 19:09:12 Does it involve invading other countries on a false pretext and then stealing their oil?

2586 2018-05-31 19:08:34 A morning shot of healthy sauce does the soul some good. 

Here's a recipe (Katie needs this in her life anyway, Greg we're sorry). 

A1 Vinaigrette:
    1/4 cup olive oil
    1/4 cup sour cream
    1/4 cup A1 Steak Sauce
    2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
    2 tablespoons honey
2587 2018-05-31 19:08:20 bull crap  london alone raises more tax revenue than the whole of scotland if  scotland is so self   sustainable why do we need the block grant from westminster well i will tell you stupid scotland does not raise enough in taxes oil revenues have plummeted get ur facts  straight

2590 2018-05-31 19:08:09 maybe try oil or wax instead of bud for pain ?
2591 2018-05-31 19:08:04 Not fast enough but happy to see blue once again! More days like this and we hopefully be back in the 50's comfortable again before the real news comes and this sp takes off to the point of no return!
2592 2018-05-31 19:07:52 Some beautiful oil cloths today!!!
2593 2018-05-31 19:07:48 Yes, and blowing up the "Iran Deal" is already translating into higher gas prices at the pumps. A gift to Big Oil, no doubt. Watergate did not bring down Richard Nixon, it was the 55 mph speed limit. Americans can only take so much.
2594 2018-05-31 19:07:19 Coward and also a king and a man of oil
2595 2018-05-31 19:07:16 We should close all pipelines coming in from Canada. We don't need toxic oil pollution. Or threats to our safety and environment.
2596 2018-05-31 19:07:10 Oil,Borewors stew...
2597 2018-05-31 19:07:06 oil, air filter, putting the racing seats in the truck. gonna be a fun weekend.

2599 2018-05-31 19:06:37 Im just trying to be sad and shove my face with chili cheese tots while I’m waiting for an oil change but men keep approaching my car to talk to me and I’m not here for it

2601 2018-05-31 19:06:23 Yea go get some wine & oil change. Good! I have 10hr layover when I Come Spain at ORD. 
2602 2018-05-31 19:06:22 Anyone wanna drop off vegetables oil to my house?? Im baking cupcakes and thats one ingredient i forgot 
2603 2018-05-31 19:06:20 Used a napkin to get the oil off my pizza. It took off the cheese. Pretty much sums up my day today.
2604 2018-05-31 19:06:12 as you know, is all about the power struggle, and scoring points and pointing at one another's mistake, the arms industry is the biggest industry, no one wants peace. oil for arms and strategic position all want.
2605 2018-05-31 19:06:09 If it permeates all of the material, maybe but if it only treats the surface like a lot of other latex/vinyl oil treatments do, then, not really.  It might change the finish of the material (like it seems to have already) and eventually remove any markings, like the eyes.
2606 2018-05-31 19:06:08 In 2011, fossil fuel use created 33.2 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions worldwide. Coal is responsible for 43% of carbon dioxide emissions from fuel combustion, 36% is produced by oil and 20% from natural gas.
2607 2018-05-31 19:06:07 You know that the higher gas prices are the better paying jobs in the oil and gas industry are as well as more jobs, when it goes up Texas flourishes
2608 2018-05-31 19:06:05 Trudeau's version of common sense = buying an oil pipeline after years of condemning oil and oil dependency and encouraging people to stand up against oil pipelines lol
2609 2018-05-31 19:05:55 Peak oil
2610 2018-05-31 19:05:32 You'd think the little treason weasels Jared or Jr, could have colluded for better oil deals while they were at it! LOSERS!
2611 2018-05-31 19:05:30 Actually I do
I've tried A LOT of the products related to weed that claim miracles! My Dad has Parkinsons and if you want to see amazing go to youtube and search weed and parkinson's disease!
I've bought oil in drops, in gels, in paste, in tablets, in powder and....
2612 2018-05-31 19:05:23 You need more spray oil!
2613 2018-05-31 19:05:22 And Coconut Oil. (Promote healing process)
2614 2018-05-31 19:05:19 I was getting stressed and chris smeared lavender essential oil all over my nose I love him so much
2615 2018-05-31 19:05:13 I feel you on this Joe, but if there is any defence for these actions it's this...there are soooo many people giving out this type of advice on social media people are confused AF. I see people eat straight MCT oil at end of the day to hit specific fat% its sad
2616 2018-05-31 19:04:38 Looks like politics to me. Just like that oil shortage back in the 70's?
2617 2018-05-31 19:04:34 To tell the truth,' said the Dean, 'I'd expected something a little more classical. Oil lamps. Discus throwing.
2618 2018-05-31 19:04:32 I normally smell like coconut and flowers but now I smell like rosemary oil and depression
2619 2018-05-31 19:04:11 Yes reduced. — Burning fossil fuel releases CO2 and burns oxygen. 87 percent of all human-produced CO2 emissions come from burning of fossil fuels like coal, natural gas & oil. The remainder results from the clearing of forests and other land use changes. (9%)
2620 2018-05-31 19:04:10 It’s a huge accomplishment to be an even more effective puppet for Big Oil than a conservative government could be. Good stuff.
2621 2018-05-31 19:04:07 The only oil assets the government should be buying are the oil companies themselves.
2622 2018-05-31 19:03:56 You know what would be really cool? If ships stopped burning heavy fuel oil.
2623 2018-05-31 19:03:55 Amazingly, these snake oil salesmen Always seem to know what god wants them to do.  It always seems to coincide with their personal desires. 
2624 2018-05-31 19:03:53 You're creating a distinction without a difference. The US is a democratic republic, and it has a constitution. You can call it a constitutional republic, but calling it a democratic republic isn't incorrect.
2625 2018-05-31 19:03:48 Oil is your friend
2626 2018-05-31 19:03:35 Common sense and trump. Like oil and water, PM Trudeau.  Oil and water.
2627 2018-05-31 19:03:14 Is there anything Trudeau & his liberal misfits haven't screwed up.
Has allowed Quebec to kill the Right Wales with raw sewage
Gave away $B's!
Screwed up the Oil business!
Screwed up NAFTA!
Screwed up our borders!
Screwed up immigration!
Screwed us with the Carbon Tax!

2635 2018-05-31 19:02:15 You just upset you played yourself? Secularism simply requires religious, or areligious, neutrality. You said yourself, that's one of the principles the founders used in the documents.
Thus, the US is a secular nation. That's all I've been getting at.
2636 2018-05-31 19:02:04 Tbe Democrats opposition to

actually, its the Democrats and their agenda that  "ONLY OFFERS FALSE HOPE".

2645 2018-05-31 19:01:11 What? It’s a dispensary that you go to that has medical MJ and CBD oil without THC. You obviously have no idea how this works.
2646 2018-05-31 19:00:52 The oil industry should be controlled by the crown conservatives have continuously sold out Canada going as far back as the Avro Arrow
2647 2018-05-31 19:00:36 That's really odd! :O 
There are dyes out there that are peroxide free as my aunt uses ones I think they are like vegetable oil based or something ?
2648 2018-05-31 19:00:36 I splashed hot oil on my finger and it’s already starting to blister. About the size of my finger nail. I’ve come to the conclusion that burning to death would really be quite painful.

2662 2018-05-31 18:59:19 HYDRATING. lol. You want to hydrate oily skin. Moisturizing is different. Hydrate. Water. Products with ingredients what hold water into the skin: Aloe, lactic acid, hyaluronic acid, honey, urea, glycerin. (Definitely don’t use olive oil, oil hates water)
2663 2018-05-31 18:59:06 I wonder out loud why anyone would vote for a party (republican) that is pro big govt (war, oil subsidies, Cia, fbi, dod $, etc) or a party (dem) that is pro big govt, high taxes, economic terrorism, etc. I'm personally not interested in pro govt anything

2671 2018-05-31 18:58:34 Mr Trudeau you should retaliate by cancelling the tar sands oil pipeline, or at least put a tariff of $US25 per barrel until the trade war this President wants has ended. He'll remove the tariffs if you agree to put money I to his own bank accounts, the man is a crook.
2672 2018-05-31 18:58:18 It’s ridiculous that you need a step ladder to check the oil in the 2011 F-150

2680 2018-05-31 18:57:42 So Oil Sands should be left in the ground, but burning coal and/or enormous amounts of electricity to turn iron into steel and aluminum is a good idea?
2681 2018-05-31 18:57:36 Meat, from what i've seen (i'm planning of making it tonight) sirloin is the most used, but i guess what you normally use would work, as long as you don't cook it with olive oil.
And for toppings, steamed veggies like carrots or potatoes, softboiled egg, chives for garnishing.
2682 2018-05-31 18:57:35 so by research did you just look at the first woo woo juice cleanse site that came up or did you take five minutes and just consciously ignore the fact that you peddle dong shaped snake oil to people who don't understand how their bodies work

2717 2018-05-31 18:54:18 This week the govt paid Rs 50 billion to IPPs, Gencos, Oil & Gas companies to reduce circular debt. This today stands at Rs 397 b. Another Rs 50 b approved by ECC will be paid in days. After that the power sector debt will be below Rs 350 b which is the normal limit for debt.

2719 2018-05-31 18:54:05 Govt tax is a percentage thing. When crude oil rate goes up, the amount of tax collected also goes high. If govt has estimated a tax collection per year considering a crude rate, they can still get the same total amount by reducing rate when crude rate goes high

2732 2018-05-31 18:51:06 I guess it's about being mindful about what we buy and writing too the companies that use palm oil. There's quite a few campaigns out there on @Avaaz and @Greenpeace Always with signing campaigns and writing to our MP's of course. @HywelPlaidCymru
2733 2018-05-31 18:51:05 Just wait we will soon be allies with Russia for oil. Russia commits psychological warfare on us to get T elected. Then Rex, P honorary friend, Exxon Mobil Guy,  is conveniently put in place. Not hard to figure out they want a $500 billion back on.

2741 2018-05-31 18:50:29 Learning that now. I bought the L'oreal hydra genius that's supposed to hydrate and mattify and I never had so much oil in my life.
2742 2018-05-31 18:50:25 My concern is they are trying to replace real pain meds with CBD oil and until CBD oil is regulated like medications I'd be VERY LEERY of it! But that's just me, if it works for you then go for it, I'd NEVER begrudge anyone something that helps with pain!

2747 2018-05-31 18:49:48 Lol! Go get the damn free oil change. BTW! Is there a nice hotel by ORD?
2748 2018-05-31 18:49:43 That's why we remove congress

2753 2018-05-31 18:49:17 Name one resource that we need from Russia? Perhaps oil? The Russians want to be a world power again. And it just won’t work. They’re a dying country. And it’s all because of Putin. But I blame the people to for not taking action
2754 2018-05-31 18:49:17 All the more reason to get a pipeline to tide so we are not relying on Americans to buy our oil!, and good thing for the other trade deals we have made
2755 2018-05-31 18:49:13 Oil & gas have no economic value in the ground; ownership apart from having or granting commercial rights is a nothingburger. They would never reach the metering station if such property rights had not been conveyed to an oil company. The MX State does not continue to own them.
2756 2018-05-31 18:49:11 idk if I’m too late for this, but oregano oil!!! it burns SO badly but it works wonders.
2757 2018-05-31 18:49:04 Y’all my daddy is the best. He took my car to get the oil changed and filled my car up with gas this morning 
2758 2018-05-31 18:48:59 ああオイル、どうして君はオイルなんだ…
2759 2018-05-31 18:48:52 Sana oil HAHAHA
2760 2018-05-31 18:48:50 Sorry to inform you, but it takes more than just "we the people". By design. The Constitution was made difficult to change on purpose.
2761 2018-05-31 18:48:43 Been doing my life wrong this whole time just shaved and exfoliated with baby oil and my skin is so soft it’s like I’ve just been born 
2762 2018-05-31 18:48:40 Yes, oil and agriculture. It’s painful. These kids are hard-working. There is just nothing for them here. I’d get out of here if I could.
2763 2018-05-31 18:48:38 Just thinking.... why do they measure oil by the barrel?  Do they have a guy standing there counting the barrels as they get poured into the pipeline?  Why not price it by the litre?   #greatideas
2764 2018-05-31 18:48:30 This is the third time I’ve been to the car dealership to get my oil changed and I still feel as dumb as ever everytime I pull in
2765 2018-05-31 18:48:22 We're being told he can't do this but if he owns the club surely he can still transfer them money to build away? So maybe the money (aka oil) is running out or along them lines no?
2766 2018-05-31 18:48:21 @mr_markjacobs 
mr Jacobs Do y think if Kuwait has no oil USA or Bush will save kuwait??!!!
2767 2018-05-31 18:48:08 tea tree oil
2768 2018-05-31 18:48:02 Yeah, because just like Labour, they are awash in filthy oil money from Arab interests. It's just as bad in both parties so don't be a hypocrite.
2769 2018-05-31 18:47:47 I dey die. I really dey hope say Deloitte go take over, or make some gulf cash cry. We want oil money too
2770 2018-05-31 18:47:44 Okay how do you know if you're Moisturizing? I use olive oil first and then the primer. About to just say f all this shit lol
2771 2018-05-31 18:47:37 I smoked cannabis oil yesterday that was 85% THC. Your girl was in space.
2772 2018-05-31 18:47:29 The right to try act will allow broader distribution of untested drugs into use. It will also allow any crackpot clinic to administer snake oil with impunity, bilking their patients and their families.

Russia’s largest #oil company is testing its capacity to bring back output it cut under #OPEC deal, telling investors it boosted production this week by about 70,000 b/d -- more on @TheTerminal with @jfarchy @MaznevaElena #OOTT

2776 2018-05-31 18:47:17 You got me on that, I am not familiar enough with CBD oil though I CAN NOT believe it can take the place of legit Pain Meds! One question who is selling the CBD oil? If you're gonna have to pay the doctor for the CBD oil find a new doctor!
2777 2018-05-31 18:47:15 firestone is doing full synthetic oil changes for $49 on coupon
2778 2018-05-31 18:47:13 This is stunning. Makes me think of an oil painting.
2779 2018-05-31 18:47:11 Actually Dubai buys it's oil from the international market, the current prices are regulated after the lifting of the subsidy 2 years ago. The margin is very thin, and all foreign companies are in a JV with the local govt backed enterprise.
2780 2018-05-31 18:47:04 When investors say wtf! You're putting tariffs on the nicest people on the planet??? DOW down more than 1 percent, oil down almost 2 percent. Thanks @realDonaldTrump

2782 2018-05-31 18:46:56 My wife @megan_mcnabb deals w/similar symptoms and found success through essential oils to manage them. She runs an endo support site but the oil education is universal and we’d love to help match you up with new solutions that could make a difference for you

2786 2018-05-31 18:46:41 my lyft driver jus told me the oil companies own the gps systems so u waste more gas
2787 2018-05-31 18:46:39 Also what’s really good in general for their coat is some fresh tripe from the butchers and some olive oil with orange (from seven seas!) I found that works brilliant on the coat overall. Just 2 tea spoons a day
2788 2018-05-31 18:46:37 / so i've just started taking marijuana oil and it tastes like i just took a handful of chives, shoved it in vegetable oil and put it in my mouth??

2789 2018-05-31 18:46:32 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
2790 2018-05-31 18:46:24 I need an oil change
2791 2018-05-31 18:46:14 Smithsonian Magazine even had a drawing illustrating the history of snake oil salesmen when discussing Bitcoin and similar currencies.
2792 2018-05-31 18:46:12 Keep going @realDonaldTrump!  Keep killing the @GOP chance @ midterms.  Your higher oil prices 4 ur buddies are making gas more expensive  thereby making products and services more expenses 4  people which completely wipes out gaines people make in their pay. #MAGA
2793 2018-05-31 18:46:11 every single time i go and get my oil changed the workers just give me this big long list of reasons why my car sucks in every aspect possible lol
2794 2018-05-31 18:46:10 External reserve that hasn't cleaned one gallon of oil spillage in ogboni and given me good road from Lagos to Ibadan
2795 2018-05-31 18:46:09 Bakersfield, right? That doesn’t surprise me with the mini oil and gas economy that has been completely destroyed up there thanks to stupid White House leadership and OPEC.

2801 2018-05-31 18:45:16 A bot must wait until the rabbit is old enough to be neutered.

2802 2018-05-31 18:45:11 For those who are on the knife's edge economically the current policies of Donald Trump are breaking their backs by degrees. Raising insurance and healthcare costs. Raising oil costs (fuel, heating, manufacturing and transport). Raising the costs of goods directly by instituting
2803 2018-05-31 18:45:04 When u drink too much mct oil 
2804 2018-05-31 18:44:53 A little bit of Oregano oil & lemongrass oil on the wrists, elbows, & ankles work too
2805 2018-05-31 18:44:49 The future wars will not be on oil, gold but Water. 
85% of water is wasted every year in Pakistan.
Building few dams should be the priority for any party which come into power.
2806 2018-05-31 18:44:47 We're a fairy closed econ, and if oil over the last 10 years is any guide, shouldn't make too much of a dent. Either way tho, does reduce the risk of overheating ;)
2807 2018-05-31 18:44:45 There was a slight hint of olive oil and vinegar too.

No ragerts though
2808 2018-05-31 18:44:36 Even dodo fried with palm oil
2809 2018-05-31 18:44:35 Relationship status: I've eaten pasta with olive oil for breakfast and lunch today because my kitchen is v. empty before I move, lol sob
2810 2018-05-31 18:44:29 "I think paper makes a person smart."
2811 2018-05-31 18:44:25 Should be standard: salt & pepper, oil, kitchen roll, a toilet roll per toilet, tea, coffee, sugar

Nice but not surprising: milk, a loaf of bread or some biscuits

Best: the place we went in Derbyshire where we got all this and CHEESE & they replenished for our second week
2812 2018-05-31 18:44:21 He was draining the dollars in the foreign reserves into the economy to supplement demand for dollar. Naira was bound to crash. We don’t produce nothing but oil.
2813 2018-05-31 18:44:19 Isn't that what Trudeau is doing with the Clintons, the Obamas and the Soros - making Canada part of the U.S.?  Selling cheap oil to them, giving them hydro and laying down on softwood lumber under Trudeau.
2814 2018-05-31 18:44:15 Lmao! Go get that free oil change

2824 2018-05-31 18:42:30 Developed as first generation robot infantry in the War on Christmas, fliptrees became sentient in 2018, commandeered a decommissioned oil tanker in Long Beach, and were last reported heading for the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.
2825 2018-05-31 18:42:21 As well as the Bush Administration which has never been held accountable for the brutal and illegal invasion and occupation of #Iraq for oil, and the rise of #ISIS.
2826 2018-05-31 18:42:12 Yes her so much perfect features puts more oil to the fire 
2827 2018-05-31 18:42:11 If we were independent we’d have 100% of our resources , not 10% or less. Oil good example, WM has squandered this asset.
2828 2018-05-31 18:41:57 I've simply charged that the US is NOT a "Christian nation." You yourself just said that the founding documents were written from a position of religious (or even lack thereof) neutrality.
You know what that's called?
Secularism.
2829 2018-05-31 18:41:45 Trump better be careful: In 2016, Canada was the largest foreign supplier of crude oil to the U.S., accounting for 41% of total U.S. crude oil imports and for 20% of U.S. refinery crude oil intake. Canada exported 3.08 million barrels per day to the U.S. in 2016!
2830 2018-05-31 18:41:44 The guy at the oil change place said “there was no oil on this dipstick” and I had to act shocked. Even though that’s why I’m here.
2831 2018-05-31 18:41:43 they must be responsible for the oil
2832 2018-05-31 18:41:42 Oil price, noteban anti-minority/dalit approach, youth employment are still major burning issue propagated by opposition. Night noisy  discussions on some TV channels favouring BJP will do  no good for BJP. Invest Govt money so that  common people get immediate direct benefit.
2833 2018-05-31 18:41:41 An Oil Storm Is Coming, and Russia, the Saudis and Iran Hold All the Cards

Russia and the Saudis are now in a position to decide whether oil price comes down or continues its rise,

2835 2018-05-31 18:41:38 Yeltsin began the party by giving state owned industries to his cronies. Without research I understood Roman and Berezovsky were given an oil company by Yeltsin in the early 90s
2836 2018-05-31 18:41:32 Get you an older nigga they massage you with lotion and oil and shit.  y’all young mf be acting lazy.
2837 2018-05-31 18:41:31 Olive oil?
2838 2018-05-31 18:41:31 Going get my oil change today and clean my car it’s a must.
2839 2018-05-31 18:41:28 If Roman ever decides to sell the club, we will probably have a number of oil rich, sovereign states tripping over each other to buy us, probably making us the richest club in Europe, meaning we can go back to ruining football again.

2845 2018-05-31 18:41:12 Every time I go to see the ex in-laws I come home with a haul. 2 bottles of perfume, 2 grapefruits, a bag of Italian coffee, a geranium for my bathroom, and a plug-in oil filled radiator for when it gets colder. Their son might be a bit of a tit but they're the salt of the earth.
2846 2018-05-31 18:40:59 I like that it gives the illusion of an oil painting.

2851 2018-05-31 18:40:48 James, and I ask this out of genuine interest, what's your view on bread with oil and/or balsamic vinegar for dipping purposes?
2852 2018-05-31 18:40:45 also the less heat you put on it the better! If I ever used heat, later at night before showering I would always put a mask on my hair (and masks can be as simple as coconut oil). About once a month I would splurge on a deep condition to really nourish the hair.
2853 2018-05-31 18:40:38 Jiffy lube for synthetic oil take 95  I got u on a coupon
2854 2018-05-31 18:40:32 Unclear. Tariffs are a negative supply side shock, like higher oil prices. So that might outweigh the negative demand effects via uncertainty.
2855 2018-05-31 18:40:25 あの時のBBの言葉はスッゲー嬉しかったなー…
2856 2018-05-31 18:40:22 It's #Hypocrisy, when you believe PMB said Nigerian youth are lazy, but find it difficult to commend PMB when he said Nigeria greatest asset is not oil but Nigerian youth.
#Try to be fair to even your enemies.
2857 2018-05-31 18:40:15 I have fibromyalgia and terrible period pains and I’ve been recommended to try CBD oil and eat CBD gummie sweets. Just bought some today so I’ve not tried yet but they are meant to be reallllllly helpful for pain. Worth a try maybe? 
2858 2018-05-31 18:40:10 Any model after 2015 take synthetic oil only

2861 2018-05-31 18:40:04 Pro tip: 
Use Coconut Oil as dressing on Kale salad. It makes it a lot easier to scrape off the plate into the dustbin
2862 2018-05-31 18:39:58 AAA sent me a coupon for a free oil change but all the spots are out in the burbs 
2863 2018-05-31 18:39:48 With oil royalties and their existing cultural marketing strategies, a free Scotland could be one of the most successful nations in the world. Free Alba.

2866 2018-05-31 18:39:29 Apparently the seniors last year poured baby oil in all the hallways. That’s pretty epic. Glad I wasn’t hear for that bs though.

2874 2018-05-31 18:38:39 Isn't Canada our number one supplier of oil and wood? This is just... God damn it.
2875 2018-05-31 18:38:31 Keep going @realDonaldTrump!  Keep killing the @GOP chance @ midterms.  Your higher oil prices 4 ur buddies are making gas more expensive  thereby making products and services more expenses 4  people which completely wipes out gaines people make in their pay. #MAGA

2885 2018-05-31 18:37:15 Well let’s see, the world is living away from oil.  Electric cars eillmdouble worldwide by 2019.  Who’s going to buy he oil? Even The saudi’s are going solar.  I don’t get it.  30’years sho maybe... 
2886 2018-05-31 18:37:14 I REALLY hope more people will get over their ‘off with her head’ mentality when it comes to the Libs- the blowfish  is like a snake oil salesman- even NDP w/b better,  but LIBS deserve another chance. ANYONE BUT #NotFord !!!

2890 2018-05-31 18:36:54 They are from a footprint tunnel, the ink is charcoal mixed with vegetable oil, then the animal walks over white paper. Gives v clear prints!
2891 2018-05-31 18:36:35 I live and breathe the air in rural Alberta where my neighbours & friends very often in patch related industries, upstream or downstream, myself included.  Many of my kids friends from HS all work in the oil patch.  I haven't met a "TFW" yet.
2892 2018-05-31 18:36:32 All those achivd during global oil price meltdown..evrything will reverse rapidly to  original state or worse in next 1 yr. Gains during oil meltdown r gonna b splurged on populism in the election year.
Nett benefit to the country = Nil
Nett benefit to BJP = Electoral bonanza
2893 2018-05-31 18:36:26 I use coconut oil and it takes the heat out and then aloe Vera!
2894 2018-05-31 18:36:23 - Use a toner in the AM/PM 
- Consider a matte or longwear foundation 
- Set makeup with powder 
- Use oil blotter sheets  
- Gel moisturizers work best with oiler skin, versus a cream 
2895 2018-05-31 18:36:15 Didn't know the Lions sponsor oil tankers
2896 2018-05-31 18:36:09 @mikeschussler @Moneyweb Why is @SasolSA governed by the same price laws as OPEC oil when we produce locally and practically funded Secunda and Sasolburg off the backs off South African Tax Payer? #FuelPrices
2897 2018-05-31 18:36:00 Funny how everyone is outraged over the steel tariffs because it will hurt Ontario steel industry. Alberta oil industry has been taking a beating for years with thousands of jobs lost. What does Canada do about that? Nothing. #albertastrong #steeltariffs
2898 2018-05-31 18:36:00 My suggestion to Chrystia Freeland responding to Trump's tariff on Steel and Aluminum: Impose a premium on oil exported to the US. 10% to match the tarriff % and another 10% for Trump being an idiot as always. Yes my friends, it can be done.

2903 2018-05-31 18:35:38 Charge 25% tariff on all oil and gas and 75% tariff on all water exports to USA
2904 2018-05-31 18:35:31 N coming to inflation point, oil price is one of the main force which decides CPI inflation.Bcoz most of the products in CPI basket are manufactured n transported with the help of pet. Whose increase in rate will gradually pass on to essential goods n leads to increase in price.
2905 2018-05-31 18:35:25 Alberta will probably threaten to stop shipping oil to the States.

2907 2018-05-31 18:35:06 I had to pay for my oil change again for the first time after two years and it hurt me to have to pay for it

2913 2018-05-31 18:34:37 The US, that illegally invaded #Iraq, killing thousands of innocents and destroying a sovereign nation for its oil, has no credibility. What do you think have rose to #ISIS? #GOPHypocrisy #USWarCrimes
2914 2018-05-31 18:34:26 Check ur facts Sir ! BA was a chronic loss making unit in 1979, when minority stake sale was announced ! It had to be postponed due to the 79/80 oil crisis.
Thatcher appointed Lord King to restructure & prepare BA for privatisation.King took 3 years to rebuild & then sell in 1986
2915 2018-05-31 18:34:25 I'm letting you know that when you microwave your tofu, chances are your electricity is coming from somewhere else that can simply turn off your supply if need be.
That is assuming you'll be able to find tofu...
2916 2018-05-31 18:34:24 I assume saving town gas meant you would need to use less oil and coal as competing fuels.
2917 2018-05-31 18:34:21 Canada needs to sell usa its oil (heavy oil sands) at a discount over west texas and buy back refined gas. Canada also imports most fruits, veg...usa imports heavy on earth commodities etc
2918 2018-05-31 18:34:17 Stubbs: New Brunswick's paper accused Justin of killing Energy East by changing rules halfway through.

Rudd: It's crazy that you'd say that we Liberals interfered politically. All we did was change the rules and say that we wanted to phase out Albertan oil.

2920 2018-05-31 18:34:15 Lol dude, your piece of paper doesn't make you smart. I'm not arguing what you think I'm arguing. Find, for me, any reference to the primacy of Christianity, or even a single reference to the Christian god, in the founding documents, and I'd be wrong. But there isnt, so I'm not.
2921 2018-05-31 18:34:05 Here in #Bulgaria, roses have a special place in people's hearts. The production of rose oil is a major industry, and there are rose festivals and rose queens and so on.

2926 2018-05-31 18:33:42 It’s very disappointing to know the potential we have as an energy rich country and our bull headed politicians that prevent us from prospering as a nation. The revenue from oil would support many social programs but we have no back bone to stand up to the few who oppose.
2927 2018-05-31 18:33:39 $90 on a damn oil change. I didn’t know I was driving a Beamer

2931 2018-05-31 18:33:13 ...are we going to cut off their access to cheap oil? We should. They pay much less for gas than Canadians. They should be made to park those F150 trucks.Make then waddle.

Perhaps I can help is by point out that this disaster is a consequence of Climate Change & the US Oil Industry - as primary guilty party - should bear the costs of reconstruction. 

The strong should protect the weak!
2950 2018-05-31 18:32:13 @GMcanada  all faith in GM gone. Hoops to test oil consumption proves dealer rigs the test so consumption is not fairly measured.  Won’t deal or buy with GM ever again. I had removed 500 ml of oil before test with a mechanic friend and they told me it was still full.
2951 2018-05-31 18:31:58 I consider myself British now but that dosen't change anything. There is no fear of Ireland joining the UK basically bc of the equivelance idiots like you on both sides. Irish cultire history are opposite to British culture history. Its like trying to mix water and oil.

2953 2018-05-31 18:31:41 I've used that before! I've mixed it with coconut oil. I think all this humidity got my shit extra dry because my hair has been too. It's terrible.  I think I need to do something weekly

2963 2018-05-31 18:30:53 5% doesn't explain a 14% spike in pricing compared to last summer, and with ever-surging oil exports, we're going to see higher and higher with growing Asian superpowers. We're in decline. We're already a conduit for TransCanada to expand their oil portfolio, expect more of it.

Now we live in a time of cryptocurrencies and higher oil demand. Doesn’t take a genius to figure out next step.
2975 2018-05-31 18:30:11 Unlike motor oil, transmission fluid is not burned off or consumed by your car's engine. This means that if you have a leak it is easily observed when you take your car out for a short drive. Read the dipstick on level ground to be sure.

2981 2018-05-31 18:29:35 By that sense why didn't your govt reduced petrol prices when crude oil was between 30-40USD/BL, either there should be proportional rates with respect to crude oil or if govt earned extra money that time, now it should provide some interim relief also. #PetrolPrices

2985 2018-05-31 18:28:58 My favourite Jamie Oliver style breakfast is necking seven bottles of olive oil. I can only afford this breakfast twice a decade.
2986 2018-05-31 18:28:52 Plus, you options to import steel, oil, etc are Canada (largest exporter of oil and steel to US) or middle eastern countries or Russia and China. 

And you put tariffs on Canada? 

Your companies choose to import from Canada. A big factor is currency. 

US companies will pay more
2987 2018-05-31 18:28:50 We. Are. The US is a democratic republic with enshrined human liberties, no state religion, and equality under the law.  The US is best described as a liberal humanist democracy.

Fossil plants *not at end of life* closing because they are higher cost than new solar.

3014 2018-05-31 18:26:14 More than 12% of oil globally is already sold in Chinese yuan. US foreign policy is digging its own grave.
3015 2018-05-31 18:26:08 I've written a bunch of good books even a Squid could read without pictures or crayons included ya Meat Head!!!  And if I was any better, it'd be illegal in 23 state, Canada, and France!!
3016 2018-05-31 18:26:04 Tax on cooking oil.....ahaaaa
anyway hope the taxes will create a change in service delivery
3017 2018-05-31 18:25:58 you don’t realize you’re becoming responsible until you forget to tell your parents that you’re going out of state for the weekend until the day before and when you remember to tell them they just make sure you’re not dirt poor and have checked the oil in your car
3018 2018-05-31 18:25:55 Thanks. It's the palm oil that bothers me. I think Divine are safe on that!
3019 2018-05-31 18:25:49 For silky hair, mix 3 parts olive oil and 1 part honey. Put in microwave 30 sec. Apply to damp hair 20 mins with shower cap on. Rinse well!
3020 2018-05-31 18:25:45 I'm all about CBD oil. I've been reading that it is killing cancer cells and stopping tumor growth. Can you tell me how it worked with your BIL? Did it or is it helping with the cancer at all as in tumor growth or killing the cells?

3022 2018-05-31 18:25:28 There is no SEC investigation into Zion Oil & Gas, Inc. The image you might see dated March 20 is a standard reply if you inquire about any company from the SEC. Just ignore such distortions. $zn
3023 2018-05-31 18:25:20 Isn’t it time for the British MSM to help our country by telling the truth about this BS in the Middle East. It is all about the US Foreign Policy to control the oil and gas supplies to Europe, keeping us subservient to their goals. There is enough info out there to back this up
3024 2018-05-31 18:25:14 wonder if @channel4news will also mention that the illegally held Golan is currently being drilled for Oil & Gas exploitation? #c4news
3025 2018-05-31 18:25:12 Hi Kayla, my wife @megan_mcnabb and I tried CBD oil for many of the things you listed & found essential oils to have stronger effects. She runs an endo support site but the oil education is universal and we’d love to help you find more natural solutions
3026 2018-05-31 18:25:12 Luckily we have our good ole Gas and Oil exports to backfill us in the meantime ..what??  JT shut that down??

3030 2018-05-31 18:24:44 What about Maple Syrup? It goes for about $1,200 per barrel. Nothing like #Oil lol #Canada
3031 2018-05-31 18:24:43 I’ve read a few bits about how he and others like him amassed wealth and while I’m no expert it seems that a few Of Putins cronies amassed state run businesses and utilities for peanuts. It intimated all their wealth is from businesses which belonged to the state, oil, gas, steel
3032 2018-05-31 18:24:39 @MeatSauce1 dawn dish soap on that oil stain will take that shit right out in the wash!!!
3033 2018-05-31 18:24:38 Having a car is great until you have to renew your title, buy tires, change the oil,buy gas etc
3034 2018-05-31 18:24:37 Lolol dude, you can't read. Nature's God is a Diest concept and the ONLY reference to god in the founding documents. 
Christianity. Don't. Mean. Shit. In a liberal humanist democracy.

3041 2018-05-31 18:23:34 Remember Justin. How the orange Ass hat had the ignorance to try and play you with lies in earlier trade meetings stick his tarrifs up his arrogant a$$  stop sending our oil and start refining ourselves.  Our electricity, lumber, water agricultural etc
3042 2018-05-31 18:23:26 @justintrudeau talking about global security being a priority while the border of #canada has been wiped out.
Close the border to illegals and see the weather change.

3043 2018-05-31 18:23:23 Wait so lightskin people don't use coconut oil ? 
3044 2018-05-31 18:23:12 And make us buy it in Canadian dollars basis...you know, like the Chinese did with oil. Nobody will notice & there’s no way Trumpland idiots will figure out that the looney back at par is the ultimate tariff.
3045 2018-05-31 18:23:03 I REALLY hope more people will get over their ‘off with her head’ mentality when it comes to the Libs- the blowfish  is like a snake oil salesman- even NDP w/b better,  but LIBS deserve another chance. ANYONE BUT #NotFord !!!

3048 2018-05-31 18:22:45 Do u know that money earned by oil co goes to govt. Or get reinvested in new oil wells or new plant for meeting the increasing demand of oil products. Pls dont spread wrong information for ur sensational news.
3049 2018-05-31 18:22:40 Oh I love deep blue! Hands down my favourite cream for muscle soreness...I bath in the oil as well with some serenity...you can hear the muscles take a deep breath & relax!
3050 2018-05-31 18:22:28 If only you showed the same strength toward greedy oil companies.  If you allow the pipeline to be built to BC, when the inevitable spill occurs, your legacy will be one of environmental catastrophe.
3051 2018-05-31 18:22:18 Oil in brain 
3052 2018-05-31 18:22:13 Big red got an oil change and got washed she looks so pretty! 
3053 2018-05-31 18:22:11 Cooking with coconut oil makes everything taste so much better 
3054 2018-05-31 18:22:10 The nukes were WWII, the invasion of China was more around WWI (which the US putting sanctions on Japan for doing lead to the Pearl Harbor incident as a counter-attack on our interference and restriction of their oil)
3055 2018-05-31 18:21:50 You still thinking oil? 
3056 2018-05-31 18:21:38 Looking for another country with oil he can bomb when he returns to politics
3057 2018-05-31 18:21:32 If @WolfForPA doesn’t separate his pockets from the oil and gas industry, he will lose the November election. So what is it Gov Wolf? People first or Sunoco? You choose!
3058 2018-05-31 18:21:32 Shoutout to Subaru for cleaning the interior and exterior of my car for free with this free oil change 
3059 2018-05-31 18:21:25 I have mixed feeling about seeing oil stock go up...
3060 2018-05-31 18:21:05 Seen a recomendation to a allergy parent to try CBD oil.  Not impressed. Not a good idea to buy an unknown oil and feed it or apply to an allergic child imo
3061 2018-05-31 18:20:58 Who’s oil?
3062 2018-05-31 18:20:51 @PepsiCo The facts are clear: @PepsiCo has been sourcing Conflict #PalmOil from PT SPS II –– a notoriously bad actor that has allowed the continued destruction of critical forests in the Tripa peatland. Does that seem in line with PepsiCo’s “sustainable” palm oil policy?
3063 2018-05-31 18:20:50 The NTSB estimates 95 people will die daily in traffic accidents..... how many will die from firearms related incidents?
3064 2018-05-31 18:20:48 Do you find that odd, In the least?? I give you permission to think. Also, your comment is not 100% accurate. In NY we know a snake oil salesman when we see one.
3065 2018-05-31 18:20:46 They can raise the price of the oil they sell us.
3066 2018-05-31 18:20:39 Actually I agree with BBC Douglas tonight. Why is Scotland's economy looking more dire? These are the given reasons: 

BREXIT -  a mess reserved to the UK 
Population fall - a mess reserved to the UK
Oil & Gas weakness - a mess reserved to the UK

The union is stifling Scotland.

3069 2018-05-31 18:20:33 No way. Costs me over 100 dollars to change the oil in my car. Not about to waste it on taters. :)
3070 2018-05-31 18:20:27 uhhhh newer cars don’t really need that, they warm up faster from light driving and it prevents the extra fuel from cold starts from diluting your oil, cold starts are only for the cats! maybe 10-20 seconds at most unless it’s cold
3071 2018-05-31 18:20:23 Only Jamaicans would have a building where you can get food AND your emissions done at the same time lol  ox tail gravy is really engine oil

3073 2018-05-31 18:20:12 Time to turn off the water, oil and energy.

3080 2018-05-31 18:19:35 USA isn’t the only country that can deliver such technology. If China wanta more cheap oil from Iran, they will do what they did in many commodity-rich nations in Africa: flood it with staff and machinery.
3081 2018-05-31 18:19:34 Thank you for speaking out on this issue.  Many of us are fed up with this govt which lied to us on the subject of oil and pipelines to get elected.  Corporate welfare for KM is insult to injury.

3084 2018-05-31 18:19:31 All this talk about warming up cars and I’m out here doing burnouts on a cold engine, I mean as long as I have oil pressure I don’t care
3085 2018-05-31 18:19:30 Please allow me to oil you down... and maybe lick you up
3086 2018-05-31 18:19:27 Is offshore oil deemed a reserve this was removed from the Growth Commissions evaluation... this needs clarification especially for me

3090 2018-05-31 18:18:58 I think if the voting % was more then BJP would have won easily. EC should oil its machinery and create conditions to increase vote% by doing something so that more people participate.

3093 2018-05-31 18:18:35 I tend to walk around the house in boxers when I'm alone.

Decided to cook food and oil hits my skin.

Yes.. It looks shiny and luscious but FUCK IT HURTS
3094 2018-05-31 18:18:23 Read it and weep.
"Coward."
Fucking hilarious.
3095 2018-05-31 18:18:18 Just tried this new facial cream by George Bush, completely took away all the oil on my face!
3096 2018-05-31 18:18:13 I put on baby oil everyday. Am I stupid? 
3097 2018-05-31 18:18:12 Brake special $25
Oil change special $10
Tune up special $45 dor month of june call 757-236-1051
3098 2018-05-31 18:18:10 Yes, I remember that.
There was also that quiet change to historic oil contribution (in GERS data?) that was snuck in by the UK gov (last year?)
3099 2018-05-31 18:17:56 Oh I also put in coconut oil idk if you want to try that and I chugg it lol
3100 2018-05-31 18:17:49 Cuz prolly can’t afford to get an oil change for a damn hell cat or new tires 
3101 2018-05-31 18:17:44 How about walruses and sea lions? In 2010 they were listed, in addition to sea otters, as sensitive biological resources in the Gulf of Mexico in both BP and ExxonMobil oil spill response plans.
3102 2018-05-31 18:17:29 Shocked that right wing dullards haven't gone after the Bosstones for trafficking Royal Oil in '90s. There's even video of apparent deal in what could only be the Neponset Valley Lands
3103 2018-05-31 18:17:24 Kalau jerawat ada dua ingredients padu. First benzoyl peroxide which is paling senang nak ingat benda yang Oxy 10 Oxy 15 tu. Tapi tapi tapi ya Tuhan gi try Tea Tree oil. Harga around 30 gitu. Apply last sekali after moisturiser semua. Jerawat kecut baek punya 
3104 2018-05-31 18:16:55 I’m going to check that out thanks! So far a holistic health provider has recommended fish oil, colostrum, probiotics, vitamin d, and TRS spray.
3105 2018-05-31 18:16:47 I use the mane choice easy on the curls line for a shampoo & conditioner , Mielle Organics Babassu oil for deep conditioner & Mielle Organics pomegranate & honey for a leave in conditioner
3106 2018-05-31 18:16:44 !!!! the peppermint oil you gave me helped me stay alive
3107 2018-05-31 18:16:37 No it’s not. Not when the country doesn’t import essentials. All companies have facilities on the territory of Russia. So the exchange rate plays little role. Oil is almost back to 2013 prices but the ruble isn’t back to 30 to the USD. Your numbers are subjective, irrelevant.
3108 2018-05-31 18:16:36 @CTVPowerPlay Don, one of rare ones to mention sheer terror of usually non-activist people here on Coast re fear of floating sludge from tar sands choking us. Thanks.  This ain't about oil, it's about survival!    E. media sort of  obtuse/re subject.  Thanks.
3109 2018-05-31 18:16:22 Plus anyone who talks about "sustainable budget" like the guy who posted that really just means Lots of Cops and Oil Tax Credits and nothing else
3110 2018-05-31 18:16:08 Good luck Justin, remember who gives us protection oh and buys our oil since we don't got the capacity to sell to anyone else.
3111 2018-05-31 18:15:48 That's assuming it worked in the 1st place.

3113 2018-05-31 18:15:36 Fuel from oil isn't the biggie though, it's the chemicals such as those used in the polymer industry, still gets me that we only have 2 refineries in Scotland and next to zero 'plastics' manufacturing. Fuel was a waste product in the shale oil boom.
3114 2018-05-31 18:15:35 PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, let's have an American civil war between the elites, like the scumbag Kochs, Monsanto, Big Pharma and oil on one side, and Trump, Bush, Clinton, and banker and financial fraud parasites on the other, neither side worth saving, they're all wiped out! Solved!

3121 2018-05-31 18:15:06 Guy at the oil change shop was like what year is your car? A 2015? Made my fucking day 
3122 2018-05-31 18:14:56 Yes! Every once in awhile, they mark their grass fed organic beef down really low.  I've also bought grass fed butter for less than $1 a box.  Not so much for things like coconut oil, or shelf stable items.
3123 2018-05-31 18:14:46 please balance me, why is locally produced fuel(sasol) pegged at international oil prices, since SADC has abdunt coal why not increase fuel production
3124 2018-05-31 18:14:29 How much mileage should a vagina theoretically get before it needs an oil change?
3125 2018-05-31 18:14:21 BRUH avocado oil? mango infused salt? LISTEN

3136 2018-05-31 18:13:09 @WayneLongSJ so we hear that you are in fact in favour of energy east pipeline now we need a policy to ban the imports of foreign oil to support oil producers to support all of maybe @JustinTrudeau could find it in himself to support such a policy

3144 2018-05-31 18:12:42 The ignorant thing to say is that they died for our freedom, or now lack there of. The last 20 years of war has been only about one thing, control of the petrodollar, aka oil based income. No American has died for our freedom for well over a generation, probably 2 gen’s.
3145 2018-05-31 18:12:42 combination.
gaenaknya tuh kadang kalo pake produk, gabisa sekaligus buat satu muka (?). misalnya pake produk buat reduce oil, yaa cuma bisa di t-zone area. kalo pake selain disitu, or kayak di dry-skin zone, malah bikin kulit patchy/ngelupas :(
3146 2018-05-31 18:12:36 There are no 'pros' in Scottish independence.

Scotland would have almost no source of income (forget the oil and gas, Britain is never going to give these up) and the EU has already made it clear that if they opt out of Britain, they are no longer part of the EU either.

3278 2018-05-31 17:59:12 Yep and then Canada can say nope to more oil from us
3279 2018-05-31 17:59:09 anyone who’s ever posted a skin care thread that includes coconut oil should be banned from the internet
3280 2018-05-31 17:59:07 'Someone' just asked me what Canada would do if we stopped buying their crude oil or allowing it to flow through us on it's way to the USGC for export?
3281 2018-05-31 17:59:07 Revelation 18:13  And cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.

3283 2018-05-31 17:58:37 Hemp oil
3284 2018-05-31 17:58:31 If you ever decide to try oil pulling please don’t accidently swallow some of the oil. You will suffer. Trust me 
3285 2018-05-31 17:58:29 I think the opposition has peaked prematurely. Economy picking up, oil is down. Stocks will shoot p if RBI become less hawkish here. Diwali bonanza and some of the smaller parties, such as RLD, can be peeled off MGB and SS etc. will fall in line.
3286 2018-05-31 17:58:28 Right... then I hope you don't have kids... I do... It's just getting harder to live on this planet. The future if we don't phase out oil is grim. Maybe our generation needs to make sacrifices for the next. But if you think making money is more important, then what can I say.
3287 2018-05-31 17:58:28 Working in Oil & Gas  Industry but just now am on some off time so its relaxation and a wee trip back home for 6 wks
3288 2018-05-31 17:58:27 My skin is MAD dry so I was skept about even trying it but I mix a drop of Argan oil in when I put it on and I love how it wears like that!
3289 2018-05-31 17:58:20 @lustrelux you gotta do mct oil and butter in the bullet proof coffee and blend it. Not just butter! Makes it taste like coffee with creamer!

3293 2018-05-31 17:57:55 Here's my Unbiased Lebron take on the NBA Finals. I feel like this is one of the more lopsided finals we could ever witness. The Warriors are a well built machine full of oil. The Cavs have the great King and after that is all ?????????? The Warriors have multiple guys they can
3294 2018-05-31 17:57:49 Of course, there is also  Russian oil.
3295 2018-05-31 17:57:46 How I feel about NG now that I'm gone: I used my last report card to wipe off my dipstick when I checked my oil.
3296 2018-05-31 17:57:42 I don’t use any products Since it’s difficult to find any for my sensitive skin, I was using castor oil for a bit but since I stopped
3297 2018-05-31 17:57:39 That’s your view not mine..LFC just been in the final of the worlds biggest cup competition, can’t be denied. No matter what Man City or Chelsea do they’ll always be smaller clubs..they are not natural/organically developed but small clubs doing well because of oil money
3298 2018-05-31 17:57:37 He is a retired Oil Company exec. no worries the other 5 of us siblings are not cut from the same cloth and are active in voting and campaigning.
3299 2018-05-31 17:57:33 Lavender oil. Have you forgotten your boyfriends mom is an oil guru???
3300 2018-05-31 17:57:29 just catching up on the market's news cycle.  Italy, oil bouncing around, Trump Tariffs (version 45?) pardons for white collar crimes people plead guilty to and the usual Trump screwball comments.  Aka, just another normal day.
3301 2018-05-31 17:57:28 John Boehner was an anti-LGBT bigot and oil stooge who ran cover for the Tea Party that eventually ousted him and installed Trump. He should never be forgiven.
3302 2018-05-31 17:57:12 What mayo has dairy? It’s egg yolk and oil.
3303 2018-05-31 17:57:02 First of all think about reducing oil gas electricity prices which is faced by indians the world will follow when india’s own peoples will get wat they paid for....... not for wat u do to pay for
3304 2018-05-31 17:57:02 Currently lathering myself in extra virgin olive oil... I will get rid of these strict marks!!!
3305 2018-05-31 17:56:55 Sure, no way there's any bias inherent to that degree track 
Also, nice job only responding to the least important of the points I made. 
Democratic Liberalism is a product of humanism. It has little to no dependence on religion, whatever, nor did the founding documents.
3306 2018-05-31 17:56:53 The facts are clear: @PepsiCo has been sourcing Conflict #PalmOil from PT SPS II –– a notoriously bad actor that has allowed the continued destruction of critical forests in the Tripa peatland. Does that seem in line with PepsiCo’s “sustainable” palm oil policy?
3307 2018-05-31 17:56:49 Yes, but Trump wanting sanctions against Iran oil exports is the reason that demand is greater than supply.
3308 2018-05-31 17:56:39 Shut the oil off!!!!!
3309 2018-05-31 17:56:31 Dear sir oil prices are only 39rs but govt put lot taxes why put in gst or reduce taxes on common man
3310 2018-05-31 17:56:23 We would not be in this pipeline mess if it weren’t for the stunning incompetence of Stephen Harper. The magnitude of his failure to execute is shocking. Despite being a western Canadian conservative PM, he could not build a single pipeline to the West Coast freeing Alberta oil

3312 2018-05-31 17:56:06 @NairnsOatcakes shame to see palm oil in all your oatcakes  it’s not sustainable or ethical! As a consumer it’s a no from me
3313 2018-05-31 17:56:01 But what was the price of crude oil in barrels... check it and come to debate
3314 2018-05-31 17:55:44 You can get organic no sugar or palm oil peanut butter.
3315 2018-05-31 17:55:42 Your are young and delusional. Spend some of that time you have and do just some basic research, do some real thinking and if you come to the same conclusions you’ve expressed. Lead by example and live without  the benefit of oil.

None of my four kids could, they all grew up.
3316 2018-05-31 17:55:36 Hi Jenna, my wife @megan_mcnabb and I have used oils for years to manage various symptoms. Her site is geared toward endo support but the oil education is universal. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions and I hope you find more natural solutions
3317 2018-05-31 17:55:33 A “fryer” is a stock pot with a lot of oil in it, and the burner cranked up. Even g’ma Janet made donuts some times. My excuse is I’m lazy. And I like soy.
3318 2018-05-31 17:55:30 @ChickenInnZW i think this will be my last chickeninn i wont buy again, have had enough esp construction house branch. for the second time i bought a stale rotisserie chicken and fatty chips (i cld cook another meal using that oil). Bye
3319 2018-05-31 17:55:22 Wherever there is a a limited resources, there is a potential for a conflict. The  armed clashes in #Tukaraq is not only for political reasons, but also for economic ones owing to the fact that the area supposedly has a large deposits of untapped oil and gas. #War4resources

3324 2018-05-31 17:54:53 Sir oil ka daam aap ke bas main nahi hai lakin jute mill ke mazdoor ka salary bhi aap ke hath main nahi hai
3325 2018-05-31 17:54:44 I have to agree, I'm the families mechanic and I see the problem every year, my stepson brought me his plastic Murray lawn mower and he said used it one time, sat two months and no start. I told him you have to drain it after use or buy pure gas, I like marvel mystery oil
3326 2018-05-31 17:54:43 I’ll get the Crisco oil. This looks like a three finger experience.
3327 2018-05-31 17:54:32 Hey plant people: have you tried neem oil for whiteflies and has it actually been affective? Trying to avoid pesticides 
3328 2018-05-31 17:54:31 Electricity will be the greatest threat to oil money in the middle East in the future.
3329 2018-05-31 17:54:16 Yes 2 spoon neem oil in 1 litre water.  But how much of vinegar in it shud we put?
3330 2018-05-31 17:54:16 So does that mean wind was costing us money when price of oil was really low

3334 2018-05-31 17:54:00 Raise discounted oil prices
3335 2018-05-31 17:53:53 No “oil control” “mattifying” products are going to help slow oil products in the long run. Focusing on hydration, exfoliation & diet are how you get oily skin truly under control
3336 2018-05-31 17:53:47 Careful about empty tuna cans laying around especially  Oil packed ?
3337 2018-05-31 17:53:46 Subsidy is not the need of the hour. And govt dont need to pay oil companies. All they need to do is just reduce tax they are charging on each ltr of fuel!
3338 2018-05-31 17:53:42 gettin on snap & seeing other people’s oil / hot dabs , make me realize my RECLAIM be more fire than these mf’s oil, & i don’t even smoke that shit i collect it for edibles . 
3339 2018-05-31 17:53:40 It’s a powder so basically it sucks up the oil
3340 2018-05-31 17:53:38 3) temporarily increased oil price
3341 2018-05-31 17:53:25 It's to force this business to make ways how to stop terrorism to spend their own money for them not to hurt their businesses. They are the only able to stop this kind of group. They are funding this group for them not to bomb their oil refinery and you can't blame them for that.
3342 2018-05-31 17:53:23 Biore oil cleansing and hada labo
3343 2018-05-31 17:53:15 In 2008 Greek bank bail out money was stolen,Soros that caused the London bank fail is wanting mass migration, London's courts are failing and they can't do another bailout.Italy and Spain have had enough sh@t.Best of luck to who supports socialism, oil's a high priced commodity.

3347 2018-05-31 17:52:57 Then they will buy even less,  US makes a lot of it's own oil.
3348 2018-05-31 17:52:27 #steeltariffs retaliation is simple. Let's raise the discounted oil prices the US has had for ages. Boom Mic drop
3349 2018-05-31 17:52:19 I have the same problem LOL. Maybe we are too smart  I have been using @NaturesUltra CBD Oil and I been falling asleep much quicker.
3350 2018-05-31 17:52:19 With IPP news imminent interest will start to build up here once more. There is always market interest in home grown oil and gas projects now more so than ever and IOG have the right tools and strategy in place to make this a success a 96p target is just the start
3351 2018-05-31 17:52:18 I just block all the promoted tweets. There have been so many lately, but the promoted Twitter ads aren't nearly as annoying as the scams and snake oil ads on Facebook.
3352 2018-05-31 17:52:04 Anybody entertain me while i burn the midnight oil for the 5th day in a row lul
3353 2018-05-31 17:52:04 CBD oil is not legal (affordable) for everyone, especially when it comes to treatment in children. In fact there have been legal cases brought against parents for using CBD & other hemp derived oils that don't contain thc as medical treatments for children.
3354 2018-05-31 17:51:58 @SquawkCNBC The analyst you had on, Tamar Essner, was not only poorly spoken but her analysis was comical.  After she claimed fundamentals were entirely responsible for $70 oil and that no geopolitics were involved, Becky Quick corrected her.
3355 2018-05-31 17:51:46 Raise the discounted oil prices
3356 2018-05-31 17:51:43 I hope Canada turns off the taps that provide the US with natural gas, oil and gasoline.  Why should US consumers pay less than Canadians for our own natural resources.  Sick of theOrange Preditor.
3357 2018-05-31 17:51:29 Do you even know what is Subsidy for..? that time Crude oil price were 120$/barrel...oops do you even know what does "Barrel" Means... :)
3358 2018-05-31 17:51:20 Would you rather join the frieza force and be frieza's personal assistant for life or be forced to oil jirens pecs on command for the rest of your life?
3359 2018-05-31 17:51:19 No rush. World demand for oil will continue to increase for a very long time, especially in developing countries. So once it’s built, there will be a continual revenue stream, and the buyers will line up. 
But at that point, why would Canada sell it?
3360 2018-05-31 17:51:19 @JasonGregor Gregs, quick question. There is a lot of talk about Justin Faulk out of Carolina for the oil. I haven’t seen much of him other then when the oil play him. Seems like he’s a player on the pp, but is he an adequate puck mover coming out of the d zone?

3362 2018-05-31 17:51:14 I think it's mighty rude that oat milk contains canola oil, which is probably what makes it a whopping 110 cal/cup (more than actual cow's milk) the fuck ???
3363 2018-05-31 17:50:58 Hope for the best for your sister, but maybe she can turn her life around by following your regimen?  Pharmaceuticals are deadly. Do google search onRockefeller control of Pharma.  Late 1800's, they made Pharma from Big Oil. People resisted & relied on home remedies &food
3364 2018-05-31 17:50:46 Raise the discounted oil prices.
3365 2018-05-31 17:50:39 The analyst on Squawk Box you quote, Tamar Essner, was not only poorly spoken, but her analysis was comical.  After she claimed fundamentals were entirely responsible for $70 oil and that no geopolitics were involved, Becky Quick corrected her.

3369 2018-05-31 17:50:15 If we can decreased our consumption of oil around 30% you can guarantee it will decreased the terrorism. How to do that? To promote and fully support the electric gas energy transportation. It's not only good for environment it's to minimize this oil businesses funding this group
3370 2018-05-31 17:50:14 "We just bailed out a Texas oil company with $4.5 billion, for God's sake!"
3371 2018-05-31 17:50:12 Well, if the problem still persists we highly recommend you giving CBD oil a shot! We do carry some and we would love to give you a discount if that's something you want to try at some point.

3392 2018-05-31 17:47:42 Still didn't answer about your reference to oil and coal. Two things that aren't being drilled for in Minnesota. I think you have us confused with North Dakota.
3393 2018-05-31 17:47:41 Healthcare, tuition and housing prices growing at double digits for years in a sub 2% economy. Oil goes to $70 and everyone is worried about wallet share. First in business.
3394 2018-05-31 17:47:40 No? The reason why it turns all pruned is because the oil on your skin gets sucked off by water and it causes skin to shrivel
3395 2018-05-31 17:47:31 Rising oil prices and tariffs will harm our GDP growth too. Prop up a few industries at the expense of every other American.
3396 2018-05-31 17:47:17 sir,pl get d basics right.price of petroleum products is deregulated since 2015, & Oil Manufacturing Companies decide on d price.Central govt doesn't hav any role in this. infact when prices rise,d state govts take d malai,as VAT is ad valorem.

3402 2018-05-31 17:46:28 I use rapeseed oil as my go-to vegetable oil for cooking. Just because it can be used to make biodiesel doesn't mean it's dangerous in its standard form (although it can be overheated and cause chip pan fires for example...)

3408 2018-05-31 17:45:31 Suntan lotion and sunblock.  When I was 10 I loved the smell if banana boat ranning oil and would wear it as a pefume lol Now I buy Sand&Sable perfume smells like the beach to me.
3409 2018-05-31 17:45:24 Pet peeve: hearing people pronounce oil as 'ol'.
3410 2018-05-31 17:45:20 If you suffer from anxiety, here's a really great and natural way to help: Put 2-3 drops of lavender essential oil on your palms and rub it into your neck. Roman Chamomile oil has also proven to be very effective.
3411 2018-05-31 17:45:18 You are the ignorant one.  Jerusalem is the promised land for the Jews.  It is Biblical and was promised to them by GOD long before Palestine even existed.
Notice, Oil was not found there until Jerusalem became the Capital of Israel.  It is always in God's timing.
3412 2018-05-31 17:45:10 pake minyak-minyakan, coba. olive oil / baby oil lumayan juga tuh kalo lagi kepepet 
3413 2018-05-31 17:45:06 I wanna do some oil painting tomorrow.
3414 2018-05-31 17:44:55 It isn't Nature's God alone. They made it clear you didn't need Nature's God, as they attribute the laws to Nature first. Nature and Nature's God. The laws of nature are a Lockean concept unto themselves.
3415 2018-05-31 17:44:45 Reasons I don’t want to leave the house: 1) it’s to get my car’s oil changed 2) I look terrible 3) it’s my damn day off 4) ITS HOT OUTSIDE
3416 2018-05-31 17:44:39 However coal exports and oil exports of increased
3417 2018-05-31 17:44:11 For now. The US has decreased the amount of barrels of oil we have imported for domestic consumption. 2018 looks like another year in which a reduction will occur
3418 2018-05-31 17:44:11 how do you even use cbd oil
3419 2018-05-31 17:44:09 And NOT extra virgin olive oil. Petroleum, that is. Black gold. Texas tea.
3420 2018-05-31 17:44:08 #Argentina: Oil workers began strike on Thursday morning, blocking access to Entre Lomas field and affecting production, the head of Argentina’s biggest oil union Guillermo Pereyra tells Catriel 25 Noticias.

3421 2018-05-31 17:44:00 Well I guess its time to shut off the oil and water pipelines heading South as well as the electricity
3422 2018-05-31 17:43:50 You didn't know that jobs are coming back in the oil patch too? Do try to keep up. Anyway, Canada is a lot more than northern Alberta, believe it or not, and six figure salaries are attainable in other industries. High tech, for example. But that doesn't suit the narrative, hey.
3423 2018-05-31 17:43:29 What about oil ?
3424 2018-05-31 17:43:25 Need my oil changed. 
3425 2018-05-31 17:43:23 Lets go back to the good old subsidy days where fuel will cost a couple of rupees cheaper and government will pay thousands of crores to oil companies from our tax money! Hopefully that will bring down inflation too or else let govt subsidize food for everyone!

3428 2018-05-31 17:43:04 To be fair the cost of oil has driven out most of that investment
3429 2018-05-31 17:43:01 Uh....oil prices have dropped the past two weeks and OPEC is about to increase production.   But nice try fake news!
3430 2018-05-31 17:43:00 #PetrolFairValuation is around 26, anything above that is the Govt premium which oil marketing companies #IOC #HP #BPCL and others are enjoying, though the #BypollsResult2018 shows this premium may soon turn into discount. Just #wait4Election2019 @BJP4India
3431 2018-05-31 17:42:50 I think they call that crude oil.
3432 2018-05-31 17:42:38 Pro Tip: Don't put too much MCT Oil in your coffee, you will poo four times before 11 not fun
3433 2018-05-31 17:42:32 The people of CO don’t want to see their beautiful ecosystems destroyed by oil & gas companies. I would rather put more money towards green jobs than fracking & mining. Maybe if oil & gas execs took less pay there would be more for their workers!!
3434 2018-05-31 17:42:32 $157.36 later (after discounts) I get to go home and change my oil... lol I love owning a diesel
3435 2018-05-31 17:42:18 Only I would get all greasy in tanning oil to go tan and the sun would go behind the clouds after 10 minutes
3436 2018-05-31 17:42:16 The facts are clear: @PepsiCo has been sourcing Conflict #PalmOil from PT SPS II –– a notoriously bad actor that has allowed the continued destruction of critical forests in the Tripa peatland. Is that PepsiCo’s “sustainable” palm oil policy?
3437 2018-05-31 17:42:04 have a good charcoal-based exfoliating routine with sensitive skin friendly toners and extra hydrating moisturizers will help balance out the problem areas—there will always be a little oil on your skin, but that’s healthy in the long-run

Im burnt out guys and going to bed for a while. This site is killing me hard to manage and trade same time. Will need help for sure.
3440 2018-05-31 17:41:49 They should redo fallout as 3D.  I'd rather see fallout 2. The attack on the enclave on the Oil Rig would likely be amazing.
3441 2018-05-31 17:41:47 Do you have any advice for moisturizing the skin properly so that it cuts down the amount of oil produced?
3442 2018-05-31 17:41:45 The one thing that’s clear, Ron, is that we are losing $15B a year by selling our oil at less than the international price. We need to get full value for our resource and we can’t do that until we can get to world markets.
3443 2018-05-31 17:41:45 My mom had to take my car for a meeting about how much it’s going to be to fix my car from where I hit a deer. She sent me a video of my mileage and my oil change sticker as if I wasn’t aware I needed one.
3444 2018-05-31 17:41:43 Complete nightmare on the @FlySWFalcon bus. Been waiting for an oil change in exeter for 40 mins. Bus driver tried everything to avoid this but they’ve left us waiting. People missing flights and all sorts. Ridiculous. But the driver is faultless. Kept us updated throughout.
3445 2018-05-31 17:41:40 @JustinTrudeau hey guess what I don’t like you.

But now, right now! This country needs you to grow a spine and pair of balls and tell the US if they want to impose tariffs on steel for us then we impose oil and fresh water tarriffs at 30% On them. Stand up for Canada ya pansy.
3446 2018-05-31 17:41:37 Coconut oil for all your lubricant needs babe 
3447 2018-05-31 17:41:35 The only place other than the trash that coconut oil belongs is on leather shoes.
3448 2018-05-31 17:41:07 moments with my stroll fam are so damn priceless luv u oil
3449 2018-05-31 17:41:06 Left and right can’t coexist.  I believe in small gov and the left believes in strong central gov.  I believe in liberty and the left believes in servitude. I believe we can’t survive as a secular country and the left wants a secular country.  Oil and water.
3450 2018-05-31 17:40:58 Things that make you go hmm... BC is suing Alberta for shipping oil through pipelines. Alberta threatens to stop shipping oil/gas to BC.  BC suing Alberta for NOT shipping oil/gas to BC.
3451 2018-05-31 17:40:57 And most of the people who did vote, voted for people they knew would continue the endless wars, and continue bombing children to death for oil. REGISTER GREEN AND STOP THE WAR MACHINE! (Unless you're in Maryland, then vote for @xychelsea!) #GreenWave #Chelsea4Senate
3452 2018-05-31 17:40:54 Harmon is a dangerous place. It’s like the Target of health and beauty products. Did you know there’s beard oil that doubles as TATTOO oil? I now own some.
3453 2018-05-31 17:40:37 (2) in essence.. oil prices high, drill. Oil prices low, sont drill today. But pipeline are infrastructure, not exploration. There is a marked difference between the two.

3459 2018-05-31 17:40:24 Amazon workers in the US are on food stamps. Who'd want to make six figures in the oil patch when you could be making minimum wage stuffing boxes ?
3460 2018-05-31 17:40:21 Due to lower conversion of ALA to long chain fatty acids in men (almost none for DHA) is why I often rant about my classmates recommending flaxseed oil with ALA instead of algal oil with DHA & EPA to vegetarians & vegans. Flaxseed oil won't appreciably increase DHA & EPA.
3461 2018-05-31 17:40:15 #PetrolProfiteering showed only how much oil marketing companies earned  but not by comparing liter of petrol sold , cars increased on road hence over all profit will be more, compare per liter profit

3463 2018-05-31 17:40:06 Get cannabis oil! Need high profile guys like u comin out and tellin the world it's ok to use this!
3464 2018-05-31 17:40:00 How a person's performance is academically shouldn't determine how well they do in life. A person can discover oil or take up a trade and get rich immediately without going to college. Not to mention that some people inherit money and learn how to make more. College is overrated!
3465 2018-05-31 17:39:58 Hey fucker @jordanbpeterson get the hell out of my city and take your damn snake oil change and shove it
3466 2018-05-31 17:39:53 How much of the oil flowing through Canadian pipelines is destined for your State?
3467 2018-05-31 17:39:39 Burning the midnight oil neh.
3468 2018-05-31 17:39:29 I need time to wind down after I watch every episode. My anxiety is so high by the end that I start sniffing my lavender oil just to calm down.
3469 2018-05-31 17:39:28 I know, i wish we didn’t call them oil balls too 
3470 2018-05-31 17:39:26 Crude oil is now down US$1.22/b to U$66.99/b for WTI. A breach below US$65.80 would intensify the selling pressure. Speculative futures owners will start to feel severe margin pain if crude falls below US$61.80/b.

3473 2018-05-31 17:39:17 Are oregano oil and oil of oregano different?
3474 2018-05-31 17:39:10 Very. She doesn’t need to date anyone in entertainment. Strictly oil/gas or finance.
3475 2018-05-31 17:39:04 Actually the girl who was talking about truffle oil sent a pic of it and it said 98% olive oil 2% "aromatic flavor" tho 
3476 2018-05-31 17:38:58 @aeberman12 Just listened to the Peak Prosperity broadcast featuring yourself. A very honest and at times worrying analysis of oil production - lack of investment and World debt. Thank you - I'm glad I don't drive an SUV.

3483 2018-05-31 17:38:40 Economic experts are saying TRAIN has effect on oil. It isn’t the only contributing factor to oil, like world market prices, politics, weakness of the peso, plus age of idiots have created a perfect storm.

The university of life called, and wants PHd for Sotto, back.

3486 2018-05-31 17:38:22 America's long history of snake oil salesmen shows that this is not the case.

Anyway, I will keep my policy preferences grounded in reality, and suggest others do the same, thanks.

3490 2018-05-31 17:38:00 If we had a pipeline from Alberta to the coast, perhaps we could sell our oil to someone else besides the US, perhaps we might have some leverage?
3491 2018-05-31 17:37:47 Big oil $ doesn't even make it to the bottom of my big list of big concerns in regards to protecting the people in CA. I'm sure Jones is a decent & hardworking guy, but Becerra's got my support.
3492 2018-05-31 17:37:40 Time alone is working for a Trump Recession...the business cycle is already relatively long. Trade war, scaring away tourism, removing immigrant worker catalyst (America’s secret sauce), and oil prices (Iran deal blowback) are Trump-caused recession catalysts.
3493 2018-05-31 17:37:36 No, I actually do not. Oil & Gas, and the Transportation sectors lead accounting for almost 50%. Buildings and Electrical together account for half as much or 24%. #KeepItInTheGround #StopKM
3494 2018-05-31 17:37:35 The #CRTC’s thinking: if oil shipments are moving from dedicated pipes  to trains that carry anything/everything, then we must tax all goods carried by trains. @melaniejoly

3497 2018-05-31 17:37:25 the best feeling ever is laying out in the sun with tanning oil all over your body then coming inside with warm skin and taking a shower that isn’t too cold but not all the way warm and then getting into sweats and laying in thick blankets in a cold room and taking a nap
3498 2018-05-31 17:37:25 So youre admitting that its only about "gun" deaths and not lowering the rates of homicide, suicide, etc. If those same people died tomorrow from, let's say knives, you would be fine with that?

3507 2018-05-31 17:36:16 idk u but i found using grapeseed and castor oil to oil cleanse at night really helped slow down my oil production during the day just do a lil research on which oil mixture is best for ur skin

3510 2018-05-31 17:35:51 Framers haven't learned how to adjust supply like Oil markets does. Milk ,Dean foods, price controls
3511 2018-05-31 17:35:45 In 2011, India imported 171.7 MN metric tons of oil, at a total import bill of $140 Bn.
By 2016, India had imported 209.9 Mn metric tons at an import bill of $ 64 Bn
The savings are roughly 3% of India’s GDP!.
Also, Modi increased tax revenues.
Put facts not numbers
3512 2018-05-31 17:35:42 Us navy showing interest again, MES shipbuilding partnership, premier oil just bought a buoy with possible con tract extension to buy more. Watch Video from OTC I posted May 18
3513 2018-05-31 17:35:34 Give it time. Trump and EPA chief Scott Pruitt will have it opened to oil drilling eventually.
3514 2018-05-31 17:35:34 So an unknown U.S. company is already extracting and selling oil in the region. The US is complicit in Steal another nations natural resources. No one in the UN is even bothering to call out the US on their illegal occupation and theft.  The UN is irrelevant.

3519 2018-05-31 17:34:52 In 7 short years, the French-led cabal of neocolonialists have totally exhausted the oil reserves of Libya with their superior technology.They have collapsed the state and are now vacating the ruins of the once flourishing welfare state.History will judge African leaders harshly
3520 2018-05-31 17:34:47 Russia wants to increase production right away from 11Mb/d to 11.4Mb/d as they have more takeaway pipeline capacity and new fields ready to produce and sell oil to China. This is bearish for crude prices and OPEC.
3521 2018-05-31 17:34:46 When it was people said it shouldn't as they used it for political gains and oil companies went in huge debts...
3522 2018-05-31 17:34:43 @Saskiavsa Greetings. Heard the conversation today about medical Marijuana. Controversial subject matter as Marijuana is still very illegal in South Africa, medical and recreational use. The laws have not been repealed yet. Pure oil extracts done correctly are the better option
3523 2018-05-31 17:34:42 i use a daily honey butter cream with neem oil in it all over, and neutrogena kids spray on spf 50. neem oil is multifaceted natural solution for so many things. and honey butter is from the honeypot-durham (online store open wednesday-saturday)
3524 2018-05-31 17:34:36 Why no help or support for Puerto Rico? Why are Puerto Ricans encouraged to move to the mainland but denied voting rights? Who owns Puerto Rican mineral and oil rights? Follow the money the Puerto Ricans aren't receiving.

3528 2018-05-31 17:34:10 So what’s the point ?
Gulf countries oil prices are way lower than Pakistan oil prices. So what now ?
3529 2018-05-31 17:34:08 I don't agree with any logic of charging more duties on Petrol. 
Why shouldn't government reduce duties and bring it to the level of 2014.
Government collected windfall when international oil prices was low, now is the time stop collecting that windfall and stop cascading effects
3530 2018-05-31 17:34:08 Today was the most productive day I had in months and all I did was leave the house before 9 am, get an oil change, and go to the bank......... Time for a 3 month long procrastination break

3535 2018-05-31 17:33:55 If the oil move klefbom its crazy. They are sounding more and more the type of organization that has a room full of 'yes' men and women and no one to critically think and challenge the room. Scary times indeed going forward.

3539 2018-05-31 17:33:49 An easy comparison to the oil & gas industry - one customer. Guess who?
3540 2018-05-31 17:33:42 @narendramodi @FinMinIndia - please reduce oil prices..this is great injustice..they did not reduce when prices went down
3541 2018-05-31 17:33:34 Analysts say oil prices won't keep plunging because US drillers can't meet demand
3542 2018-05-31 17:33:33 Makes me consume noodles with hot oil! 
3543 2018-05-31 17:33:28 I recently watched a program with former UN Secretary General @KofiAnnan harping on about good governance. Rich coming from a man that presided over the Rwanda massacre and the UN Oil For Food corruption scandal, probably the largest single case of corruption in human history!
3544 2018-05-31 17:33:14 My last oil change was $100 at the jiffy lube off west end. Before I had to use full synthetic oil, I paid about $50 for an oil change
3545 2018-05-31 17:33:13 ppl n media will only think about petrol prices, if congress will reduce the cost if crude oil by 10/-, ppl will tolerate congress for next 20 years
3546 2018-05-31 17:33:12 Why is oil getting crushed today?  Any theories?

3548 2018-05-31 17:32:52 Coconut oil or even olive oil or avocado oil with a cotton pad is good for makeup removal on dry skin.
3549 2018-05-31 17:32:49 I was just thinking it'd taste like ass.  But I guess with enough milk or cream, you could negate some of the crude oil topping.
3550 2018-05-31 17:32:45 Alright, this CBD oil stuff seems hotter than sunburn right now for pain relief. So many patients are talking about it. I can't find anything legit on PubMed. Anyone know any studies on it?
3551 2018-05-31 17:32:40 Yes — snake oil.
3552 2018-05-31 17:32:17 I figured he used oil made from the sweat and tears of starving peasants to slick it down
3553 2018-05-31 17:32:13 Yeah. We should just rely on the Middle East for oil instead....
3554 2018-05-31 17:32:07 Iran exports almost 700,000 barrels of oil per day to India. In the wake of persisting protests against the religious fundamentalism and recent strikes by Truck drivers in Iran the prices of petrol & diesel may shoot up in India.

3557 2018-05-31 17:31:45 That's the whole secret. The ones that are shelf stable Will stay that way in your system. The one with the oil is easier to break down. (Sorry, Twitter is no place for reasonable answers, my bad)
3558 2018-05-31 17:31:22 People came ti power by talking oil price are now keep mum about issue.. that is irony
3559 2018-05-31 17:31:19 Jfc that’s just wrong. Most places we’ve stayed have all the tea coffee oil milk gear and a bottle of wine in the fridge. Pretty standard. Was it airbnb? An independent rental?
3560 2018-05-31 17:31:16 @jamieoliver stop trying to be an influence and concentrate on your own life. You go on about kids getting fat and needing be be healthy, yet you drown everything in olive oil and continue to pile on the pounds yourself. Do 1.

Yes, in a country where no trader pays taxes.
Someway redemption is necessary.
That's why oil, liquor and cigarettes are punitively taxed.

3581 2018-05-31 17:29:09 The inadequacy of AI in Healthcare today and foreseeably, in my estimation, is largely evident in lack of interoperability in #EMR systems. With no common agreement on different types of #data, #AI has no oil to burn. AI without digestable data is like a car without gas.

3599 2018-05-31 17:27:19 I personally prefer gas wars. EVERY person in the country makes out, while oil companies fight. Kind of like a tax cut for all.
3600 2018-05-31 17:27:16 The 2008 top in oil was in July and the market is likely to top this year in the 1st half of July.

3603 2018-05-31 17:26:56 Marinol isn't nearly as effective as the real stuff because it doesn't contain all the cannabinoids that are in cannabis. CBD oil is legal everywhere, so try that (you can order online or buy locally). Also, lavender is good for relaxation & anxiety, can be smoked, vaped, etc.
3604 2018-05-31 17:26:53 It is not due to efficiency on our part but agreements with oil suppliers' countries and India has taxed heavily on petrol (Sales Tax).
3605 2018-05-31 17:26:51 Watching May v Corbyn is like watching the Keystone Cops chase Laurel and Hardy down a slide covered in oil.

No leadership, no direction - not even the right basic questions being asked.
3606 2018-05-31 17:26:49 Oil Companies are not CHARITY AGENCIES. They are entitled for (making) their profit. Just because most of them are owned by govt. one should not develop a  habit of DENIGRATING THEM. It is sheer POPULISM to criticise Govt owned outfits.

3612 2018-05-31 17:26:22 Slapping tariffs ON Canada eh. Hopefully they raise their tariffs on crude oil/ petroleum, vehicles, natural gas, gold and wood. What will you do then? Trade war with Canada not wise considering the US has had a trade surplus with Canada. Who gives you advice ?
3613 2018-05-31 17:26:22 @TimesNow Govt. earns from imposing tax on oil and our ministers spend extravagant life. Poor are left for one paisa joke .

3615 2018-05-31 17:25:50 And that tanker accident would devastate BC. If they wanted to refine the oil and ship it throughout the country for our own needs I'd have far fewer reservations about the pipeline.

3625 2018-05-31 17:25:00 2 simple responses to the US tariffs that would hurt them dearly.

1. Stop coal shipments from the west coast. They have no major ports on the west coast to ship coal to Asia, So they run it out of BC.

2. Build our own refinery. Stop selling them oil & buying it back refined.

Subsidies are meant for paying on behalf of people by Govt of India.

Price of Crude oil in 2013-14 was hovering around 120 USD Per Barrel 

Barrel means app 190 litres still price was max 85/litre

Now crude price is 80-85 USD per barrel still of petrol price 85

3672 2018-05-31 17:19:01 #DidYouKnow 16.2 BILLION barrels of oil and petroleum products are transported by pipelines every year? 
3673 2018-05-31 17:18:58 Usually a tbsp each of grass-fed butter and coconut oil in a cup of coffee! Blended its even better cause it foams up a bit and mixes well. Its supposed to give you an extra burst of energy and load you up full of good fats.

3683 2018-05-31 17:18:05 Preventing a climate crises and therefore the destruction of the swiss alps means stopping gas & oil pipeline companies such as @TransCanada financed by @CreditSuisse #UnitedBeyondGas
3684 2018-05-31 17:18:01 So oil generates riches that should bd shared but it doesn't generate riches. If you're a paid Tory troll you're crap at it.
3685 2018-05-31 17:17:58 So true. Renewables are our future and @realDonaldTrump  is only holding us back by tying us down to 'clean' coal and oil.
3686 2018-05-31 17:17:50 I know I have seen something about Jericho oil that girls use to tie men down abi it's another one again?
3687 2018-05-31 17:17:44 Poor Wenger two months too late for him. Nothing disturbed his career path as much as the oil money infusion. He could have fought with the man utd force but the oil mix of Chelsea became too much for him

3689 2018-05-31 17:17:23 Hemp oil is better at balancing skin? I love my rosehip oil though :-(
3690 2018-05-31 17:17:22 No link between oil and carbon.... can’t argue with that.

I would like to think France would refuse him due to his open hostility to Europe but he has enough money to oil the wheels.
3692 2018-05-31 17:17:19 Plus I only have to do an oil change on this car every 10k miles so I think I might just have the shop do it for me if it's just going to cost the same for me to do it.
3693 2018-05-31 17:17:15 Meat, dairy and oil are killing our citizens.  Whole food, plant based diet is the only diet clinically proven to reverse heart disease.  Why isn't it the default?  ]-/  $$$  #vegan #plantbased
3694 2018-05-31 17:17:07 tea coffee sugar as standard, the previous people have left some cooking oil, salt and pepper (and maybe a jar of herbs). If the owners are being super nice, a bottle of wine and a cake or home made shortbread. question is moot because we’ve popped in Tesco on the way anyway
3695 2018-05-31 17:17:05 lmao When everyone on my team thought there were birds in the office. No! Just me being extra playing nature sounds and blowing peppermint oil out the diffuser! lol #Extra #ComfyWorkspace
3696 2018-05-31 17:16:57 Sautéed kale my dude. All you need is a little olive oil, salt & pepper. As far as veggies go it’s  and it goes w/ almost any meat
3697 2018-05-31 17:16:53 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for spirulina, and put some sandalwood essential oil in my diffuser.
3698 2018-05-31 17:16:50 That's weird, because after we pulled out, Iran went to Russia to set up oil deal.

3702 2018-05-31 17:16:44 their oil requires less refining which ultimately means less GHGs.  anyway, you have your opinion, I have mine, I doubt we are going to convert anyone.  Its interesting we both want what is best for ppl & the enviro but have such different ways of wanting to do it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
3703 2018-05-31 17:16:40 Oil prices don't "kill or start" a pipeline project any more than they do the local gas station. Pipeline companies take a long view approach, and return their investments over many years.
3704 2018-05-31 17:16:39 Is it nausea or just the fatigue that’s getting him?  The canabis  oil caplets can be bought at pot shops.  Depending on what issues he’s having with the cancer there are tons of other options
3705 2018-05-31 17:16:33 Those who talk about the second half of Wenger's stint at Arsenal should now take this in context...The oil money that destroyed the balance of things and made us incapable of competing with them but still AW did a fantastic job of keeping us at the top
3706 2018-05-31 17:16:29 Tried to do an oil change on my new car and the oil drain plug was mangled and had to bring it to a shop to have it done. BUT it cost the same to have them do it for what I paid to get the oil and filter for the car so it's not a bad deal.
3707 2018-05-31 17:16:23 That is true. China can huff and puff all they want, but they still demand American beef and pork. They need our soy and corn too plus our oil!
3708 2018-05-31 17:16:13 They are so good! Also roseship oil for scars it's awesome
3709 2018-05-31 17:15:44 My sister just told me she likes oil because it has no fat. Bitch, oil is literally fat

3711 2018-05-31 17:15:26 Went to get my oil changed and they found a ton of shit that's wrong with my car, took all my money, and now I feel like I can't ever be a home owner because fuck it's enough having my own damn car

3717 2018-05-31 17:14:48 So, we now have domestic oil. We can no longer blame OPEC for the high gas prices in this country. Why then, is the price of gas per gallon over $3 & rising daily, here in NY? Anyone? Only educated, informed ans pls, Not guesses

3750 2018-05-31 17:11:42 Let's compare crime overall, to compare "gun deaths" in a country that has effectively banned them is a loaded question. If crime stays the same or goes up, all you've done is disarmed the law abiding/innocent.

3800 2018-05-31 17:07:15 Between trade uncertainty, crippling public and household debt, run-away cost of living, a deflating housing bubble with rates on the rise, a destabilized global oil market and lagging regional competitiveness, economic red flags are lining up into a perfect storm of sorts.
3801 2018-05-31 17:07:07 A huge portion of ad revenue for media organizations comes from oil industries. The same industries that have fought for decades any threats to their success, starting with the electric car. And you wonder why @elonmusk is continually attacked from the media. #AgendaSettingTheory

3804 2018-05-31 17:06:49 I took a sip of coffee and thought ‘hmm lemme use this opportunity to down some supps’ and wrote you this poem: 

Fish oil in

Slowly pull fish oil out
In disgust

3805 2018-05-31 17:06:45 true - the self sustainable method is the way to go for most. But those used to oil money or in Abramovich is case stolen oil wealth will find it heard in the real world!
3806 2018-05-31 17:06:36 Did you know electric cars like Tesla use oil to power the electric chargers
3807 2018-05-31 17:06:24 Nah, I let him live but I'm using Peppermint scented soap under the TV till I can grab some Peppermint Oil. Also he was pretty deep inside the TV. I'm hoping he's left by now.
3808 2018-05-31 17:06:10 I prepped my face by cleansing, toning and moisturizing. Now I tone with our unreleased Lavender Rosemary Facial Mist very hydrating! Plus moisturized with our Nourishing Facial Oil before putting on the foundation 
3809 2018-05-31 17:06:06 U can start taking bows when the pipe is in and oil is flowing. Till then this is wishful thinking and hoping things work out.
3810 2018-05-31 17:06:00 Ngl my mum used pink oil moisturiser, blue magic etc in my hair & my hair was beautiful (until i fucked it up). So i cannot come & die to spend hella on hair products just because 2018 says everything is bad for u

3815 2018-05-31 17:05:41 It works so well, that now the UK is having to have the same conversation all over again.... With knifes.
3816 2018-05-31 17:05:29 Non oil sector held up GDP numbers from Q1 2015 till Q1 2016. That non-oil sectois struggling to stay afloat now. 

Except the non-oil sector recovers significantly, the current GDP growth will be very volatile to oil prices.
3817 2018-05-31 17:05:25 yo dumbdick - he isn't referring to the PUF income - he's referring to all the Aggies in the Oil Business busy making billions of dollars and funding a $450MM stadium renovation.

but you're from tceh - i wouldn't expect intelligence from you.
3818 2018-05-31 17:05:17 Hey #NaturalHair people, ever done hot oil treatment before? Is it effective? Is there a preferred oil?
3819 2018-05-31 17:05:02 i hate when i have to go get an oil change
3820 2018-05-31 17:04:58 :((( I wish I had oil
3821 2018-05-31 17:04:37 The facts are that over 90% of all media in the US is owned and controlled by a mere 6 companies, all of which are in bed with oil......
3822 2018-05-31 17:04:34 Micellar water, acnes oil control facial wash, st ives apricot, viva milk cleanser, viva astringent, innisfree/food a holic/face shop/etude sheet mask, nr, olive oil
3823 2018-05-31 17:04:15 And in the end they destroy the source of their wealth. They crash the stock market over and over. They bring down their governments over oil grabs and petty corporate bribes. They loot the earth until it is poisoned and become unlivable. That’s not rational.

3825 2018-05-31 17:03:57 Oh, the snake oil salesman definitely knows what he is doing
3826 2018-05-31 17:03:57 Which is more advantageous to the state?  Develop our oil resources to enrich our country for the long term or to alleviate a temporary concern.?
3827 2018-05-31 17:03:48 Pag hanggang imagination mo lang muna chicken oil kasi diet ka HHHAHHAHA

3830 2018-05-31 17:03:31 I ATE ALL THE CHILI OIL! _:(´ཀ`」 ∠):_
3831 2018-05-31 17:03:25 But ... not all fats are bad fats ... it also helps to use oil with a high boiling point ... like sunflower oil
3832 2018-05-31 17:03:24 As long as you have millions of half witted followers, anything you tell them, no matter how ridiculous, they’ll follow regardless.  It’s so sad to know people would rather donate to a snake oil salesman than actually donate to worthy causes.
3833 2018-05-31 17:03:24 After the most corrupt president and the expansive propaganda campaign he had. and you didn’t see any of that in 8 years. you aren’t a political minded person. That would be like me not noticing Bush was after oil. Either Obama will be outed as a monster or it’s too late for us.

3836 2018-05-31 17:03:17 It was awful after the oil spill. Looks like it’s returned to before, tho
3837 2018-05-31 17:03:16 Anointing with oil heals people if you pray hard enough or something, it's impossible to be christian and a sociopath, climate change isn't real because something something jebus and liebruls, obama might be the anti-christ. #ChristianAltFacts Ugh. I feel sick thinking about ths.
3838 2018-05-31 17:03:13 I’m guessing because of the differences in how they’re made (plastic from oil, ceramic much less energy to make) and ceramic is useful and doesn’t negatively impact wildlife etc (plus ceramic does degrade - it’s just a fraction of what was made over millenia that survives)
3839 2018-05-31 17:03:08 Yes. The economy had slowed in 2015, which was largely due to a rapidly shrinking contribution from the oil sector.

The dip into -ve region was due to this admin's laziness. It will become evident later this year when oil remains at appreciable levels but GDP growth  remains low
3840 2018-05-31 17:02:59 if you are going to use the argument that oil is a Finite source, so are the minerals that are used to create a Solar Panel, and the land it takes to produce the kWH vs the Cost is not very effective!
3841 2018-05-31 17:02:45 Since you want to go that route, how much did GEJ realise from crude oil sales in 5 years and how much has PMB realised in 3 years?
3842 2018-05-31 17:02:33 Hearts drink Kenechi Oil one gallon.

3844 2018-05-31 17:02:22 I've had the gummies mentioned to me a lot and the oil, would be interesting to know if they work!
3845 2018-05-31 17:02:13 It’s only ‘tough’ to begin with. I promise. Do you use any products on it? A good beard oil is always pretty helpful. My other half absolutely hated my beard when I started growing one but had come around now haha. You got this mate!

3852 2018-05-31 17:01:51 I applaud the point. On my first trip to Italy, I couldn't believe that pies got olive oil on top of the cheese (you can do that??). But it's really critical for texture, esp. w fresh mozz.
3853 2018-05-31 17:01:36 I have a close friend who was taking Ambien. He woke up one night elbows deep in a bucked of oil paint and thinner washing his arms. Anyone who believes drugs cannot elicit bizarre behavior in people really have no idea.

3856 2018-05-31 17:01:12 Hey, Chuck, most of the increase the last 6 years has been Democrat state legislatures increasing gas taxes...not rising oil prices.

3886 2018-05-31 16:59:03 The auto and oil industry probably put the scooters out there so you could obsess on the Nth degree perfection of scooter rollout and continue to ignore the cars
3887 2018-05-31 16:58:55 They really do need to allow more research. True CBD oil that contains 3÷ or less THC is legal in all 50 states as far as I know. Also, it's made from the (legal) hemp plant & not the marijuana plant.

3889 2018-05-31 16:58:51 The crude oil that drives market is the one traded on MCX. The cost there is not a real reflection of the cost of the end of product petrol. The deductions in crude prices is often leveraged by companies in name of covering up past losses.
3890 2018-05-31 16:58:49 Same with Canada. The US however, has to buy our hydro and oil.

3895 2018-05-31 16:58:24 If we stopped subsidizing oil, maybe more people would start making more economically smart choices (since they won't make environmentally smart ones) and buy more hybrids and all-electric cars.

I've had 3 EVs. I forgot how to pump gas. I don't even look at gas prices anymore.
3896 2018-05-31 16:58:11 What a sick burn to @PreetBharara from a man that claims to be a Christian but is a crooked snake oil Salesman.  You know what’s worse than karma?  The wrath of God poured out on those that take advantage of the poor in His name.  You should read the Bible.

3909 2018-05-31 16:56:52 YES BRO. Nigella sativa oil is so underrated. "The cure for every disease except death". Restarts cellular waste detox, eats away inflammation, liver regenerative, appetite stimulant, analgesic, anxiolytic, antidepressant. It's got so many properties, highly recommended

3927 2018-05-31 16:54:56 All that to say: the POTUS doesn't have much to do with the cost of gasoline. We add taxes to it, but they're stable. We also subsidize the oil industry which helps keep the cost down, though I think we should tell them they're on their own stream from now on.

3930 2018-05-31 16:54:36 @JustinTrudeau has always overtly supported the gas and oil industries in Canada. You know what they say, if state owned oil and gas companies work in Russia and China it'll work in Canada.
3931 2018-05-31 16:54:19 Neither does Trump. California controls its coastline and we don't want any more dirty offshore oil drilling. We understand climate science, unlike that ignorant con man you blindly follow, and we know it's time to reduce our dependence of fossil fuels.
3932 2018-05-31 16:54:08 How is it that the makers of natural peanut butter have not figured out how to deliver their product without 3” of oil on top?  I’m not interested in churning it for 5 minutes before using it.  Get it together Big Peanut Butter!!!
3933 2018-05-31 16:54:07 I have these gorgeous platters I bought in Italy that I never use bc they’re so nice. And some fancy olive oil I think is too good for just me. And a really nice purse I’ve never carried. 

So either I need to stop buying nice things, use the things, or never go to Italy again.

3937 2018-05-31 16:54:00 I usually apply coconut oil after my shower... I will try it as a makeup remover as well.
3938 2018-05-31 16:53:56 No. 
The Declaration calls upon the laws of Nature and Nature's God. Not "God." 
And the US was not founded on Christian anything. It was founded on humanist philosophies, especially as described by John Locke. Many were actually diests (as Locke was).

3943 2018-05-31 16:53:31 ... freedom of religion for the native Americans. And their land, the land where they lived was stolen from them! Donald Trump and his pipeline with oil left nothing at all for the native Americans.
3944 2018-05-31 16:53:31 "Okay, ma'am, it looks like a routine oil change and 15,000 mile servicing. Do you have any other concerns with the vehicle you'd like us to look for?"

3948 2018-05-31 16:53:10 You'll feel really grubby, but a lot better. Be sure to wash only in ice cold water for a while. That helps.

Also, those vegetable oil soaps you're SO has probably been pushing on you? This would be a good time to try them.
3949 2018-05-31 16:52:58 This is correct.  I feel the same about the Oil picking Yakupov in 2012. It was the right pick, and anyone telling you they would have picked anyone other than Yak or Murray at #1 is plain lying to you.  Hindsight is 20/20
3950 2018-05-31 16:52:58 What affects gas prices is 
- wars over oil
- the value of the petrol dollar
- demand for gasoline
- the value of the US dollar if SA switches to the Euro
- the weather events throughout the world
- the stability of the markets
- what my poop smelled like the morning before
3951 2018-05-31 16:52:53 What happened to the theory of USA’s abundant oil reserve due to shale oil? 
We read that shale oil forced OPEC, Russia etc. decreased the demand so much, that prices tumbled down. 
What has happened now? Is shale a fail whale?

When international crude oil price is $40 Modi increased excise duty about 12rs on petrol n 14 on dis. So not allowed common man to enjoy Benefit. 
Now when intnl price is high he is not reducing even a single rupee of excise.

4057 2018-05-31 16:41:23 Could also be $40-50/ barrel oil.
4058 2018-05-31 16:41:15 The MoFo knows the end is near. This is his version of setting fire to the Kuwaiti oil wells, as the Iranian army did upon retreating near the conclusion of Gulf War 1.

4061 2018-05-31 16:41:07 The forgotten people? Do you mean wealthiest Americans? Trophy hunters? Oil companies? The NRA? The poorly educated? Polluters? Banks? Private schools? Racists? You are correct @realDonaldTrump. These folks won.
4062 2018-05-31 16:41:03 So. Go there and do something. 
The greatest threat is the usual one. USA, Russia, Oil, and now China as ONU permanent members of the Security Council with veto right and their policies. They are three of the five permanent members. 
The greatest is not indifference.
4063 2018-05-31 16:40:59 @SenSchumer Let's promote transportation options, improved MPG, alternate fuels and finally stop subsidizing big oil. That would be something people could get behind. This BS about the marketplace, it's old Chuck. People are tired of the same old shit.

4065 2018-05-31 16:40:58 The statistics are pretty grim. Post-1990, overall LE at birth fell to about what it was when Stalin died and it didn't recover until the sustained rise in oil prices from about 2005 onward created the modern Russian petrostate. It didn't get above 1960s levels until 2012.

4067 2018-05-31 16:40:40 There have been a number of studies that disagree on the extent to which recent increases in global average atmospheric CH4 are due to oil and gas or agriculture, with some handwavy associations with US fracking, but I'm not aware of a US-specific assessment on trends per se.
4068 2018-05-31 16:40:35 No one even knows how margarine is made. It’s literally oil and water made into a block. But that there. Give me a MF break talking about they care about the health of the citizens.
4069 2018-05-31 16:40:35 That's quite terrifying. I don't understand why this isn't a bigger issue, the oil and gas spreading.

4128 2018-05-31 16:35:49 Which isnt Canada so why are we taking more out of the ground?Point is we are never going to be there if we keep subsiding the oil. This mentality allows us to push the problem further down the road until its too late. We keep saying "this wont happen overnight"& then do nothing.
4129 2018-05-31 16:35:40 Ah the hit is $4 billion dollars , Canadian economy GDP is $1.5 trillion. Yea no recession, if oil sinking below 44 didn't wreck Canada this won't.

4152 2018-05-31 16:33:33 That hybrid system seems to work for them in these very small, culturally-homogeneous countries that are rich in oil and take in few immigrants (and are very hostile towards immigrants).

4157 2018-05-31 16:33:21 Are you starting from first principles here? The UK produces far less food than it consumes, and even if Scotland is EU and UK is ruined the UK will be buying food, electricity, water and oil from Scotland. There is no threat to Scotland's trade with the UK.

4160 2018-05-31 16:33:02 BJP leadership must now realise the fact that electionscan't be won only on Modi's charisma. They must feel the pulse of people before it's too late. The cabinet or PM should have timely intervened on  the oil prices issue which seems to be one of the causes of defeat.

4174 2018-05-31 16:31:56 In general, you have much less maintenance required for an EV. No oil changes, no transmission, etc. Mostly just tires. We have the Littleton Service Center very close and I believe they will be opening a couple more in Colorado.

4188 2018-05-31 16:30:58 I'm so sorry to hear about your dad. I would recommend a reputable CBD oil distributor. It is derived from hemp, not THC, and legal in all states. Or reach out to the manufacturer of the meds he needs and see if they'll cover it. Walgreens has an Rx card for $20? Income based.
4189 2018-05-31 16:30:53 Perhaps, not saying you're wrong. A bigger issue is the implication that smaller rounds are "less lethal" as the USA Today article said. Hollywood gives there impression there is such thing as pretty little gunshot wounds. Even .22lr can be lethal.

4204 2018-05-31 16:29:10 It's govt support to an industry to provide facilities to support export of oil in competition with exports of other countries. Reducing costs for an industry by govt action in order to bolster competitiveness is precisely the kind of thing tariffs are meant to counter.
4205 2018-05-31 16:28:59 Maybe not direct benefit but us not backing this deal means that a lot of the sanctions that were on Iran assets, oil distribution, are now lifted. In a sense, assisting them. 

Again, we can drag this on and on, no point in doing so, each entitled to our opinion.

4275 2018-05-31 16:22:13 No, it is about subsidizing US oil/gas consumption on the backs of Canadians.

4298 2018-05-31 16:20:04 This is categorically false, otherwise we would be intervening in Nicaragua, Honduras, Gaza, Yemen, etc. This is entirely about protecting western interests in access to Venezuela's oil. Posturing about human rights makes this duplicity all the more despicable

4310 2018-05-31 16:18:32 most people don’t take the proper time to do the maintenance most they do is change oil and spark plugs never thinking about changing the transmission fluid causing the problems they commonly have, but with mine the engine was prone to having camshaft sensor probs and others
4311 2018-05-31 16:18:25 Daniel: the differential for CDN heavy is 25.2 and the light sweet differential is 9.00 as you see not all oil is equal.?
4312 2018-05-31 16:18:22 Sir, r u a subscriber WSJ? If, no how have u came to the conclusion? If yes, basic premise of whole story is rising oil prices. In both cases, this kind of conclusion is not expected from IIT educated CM. 2ndly, we all know what u said for the educated PM you are referring to.

4318 2018-05-31 16:17:53 Oil management were "hoping" that Slep, Drake, Pulj, Strome and others would take it to the next level. Betting on same strategy is a very risky move. It is still early
4319 2018-05-31 16:17:52 I get it, I disagree. I’ve had several announce then walk back even concede with minimal publicity to the facts. Media likes the turmoil & it helps the govts if they appear to have stood their ground. We’re producing more oil,Poland has requested to pay for a base, Lots happening

Pradhan didnot have control over oil companies made joke of 1paisa. He is simply sitting monthly getting.

4342 2018-05-31 16:15:26 Looks like the backside of Hubbert's peak will be a fat-tail event. We passed 'peak easy oil' at least a decade ago, but there's a LOT more of the not-so-easy oil out there.

4344 2018-05-31 16:15:13 I need an oil change
4345 2018-05-31 16:15:12 Thats why Canada should not impliment a carbon tax. Canada has already done its duty.

And when China stops using coal Cana should consider a carbon tax.

Until then, Canada should sell as much oil to world (and stop importing oil).
4346 2018-05-31 16:15:05 From your friends in , we are disappointed.  We are the largest supplier of oil to .
4347 2018-05-31 16:14:54 @JustinTrudeau time to get USA's attention: hike tariffs on : Top 3 categories that the USA imports from Canada are:   1. Mineral fuels including oil: $77.9 billion   
2. Vehicles: $56.2 billion  and  3. Machinery: $21.5 billion  HIKE THOSE TARIFFS !
4348 2018-05-31 16:14:50 Electricity, oil, water and other natural resources are items that if tariffs were placed on, would impact Americans greatley

4352 2018-05-31 16:14:40 I forgot to put on coconut oil so I’m ashy
4353 2018-05-31 16:14:33 It’s more than ratings isn’t it. I mean a national crisis that America’s water supply is contaminated would bring big ratings. It’s the media’s role as a voice of the state that represents big pharma big oil the industrial war complex.  I want to get past tiny ineffectual jabs.

4362 2018-05-31 16:13:36 I’ll echo what @kestrester said. Also, I found that tea tree oil works wonders as a mosquito repellent. I add several drops to lotion and apply. It’s worked so far! But def cover as much as possible. They’re pretty brutal

4378 2018-05-31 16:12:11 Also keep in mind that vehicle fluids (oil, antifreeze etc...) that have accumulated on the roads during dry times, will be activated by the rain causing slipperier than anticipated conditions after the initial rainfall. Motorcycles be cautious and avoid middle of the lanes.
4379 2018-05-31 16:12:07 No one saw a $20-25 Permian oil price spread either...and check out Brent-WTI.  Infrastructure issues take a while to work through and the markets are now catching up. Convenient narratives are being challenged (as they should be).  Anyway good luck out there

4410 2018-05-31 16:09:13 And before you say INC time price etc, you must realize oil was not floating. IT was being subsidized and hence stoking inflation of 12% which thus meant the poor were subsidizing the trips you and your bosses kinds fat bums make everyday wherever. Big difference.

4442 2018-05-31 16:05:08 Definitely not but there a difference between state abuse and torture and shady businesses (yes I understand Roman potentially could be involved in deaths)

The Norwegian oil fund could buy us 
4443 2018-05-31 16:05:07 @NoahShachtman re: Musk - good points, esp. over-valued stock but entirely one-sided. His cars are not "lemons", electricity IS portable (hello - power lines?) he is building his own infrastructure to support Tesla (& other future electric cars) & govt subsidizes crap out of oil!
4444 2018-05-31 16:05:04 My skin looks amazing today. Tea Tree oil does wonders
4445 2018-05-31 16:05:00 If anyone wants to teach me how to change my own oil that would be great. I just spent a fortune on an oil change

4457 2018-05-31 16:03:59 Typical bullshit, taking advantage of people of color and people who may not have the means to fight them. We need reform on oil practices across the nation
4458 2018-05-31 16:03:54 The point is that Permian oil growth is going to become a lot less linear than people are used to. Severe growth causes unexpected constraints

4471 2018-05-31 16:03:07 Pinoys are still wishing what the Marcos regime had done; subsidize oil prices.
4472 2018-05-31 16:02:51 The problem is so many people don’t think about maintenance. My ex got a Lexus then was trying to figure out how to pay for the oil changes. Coworker got a Lexus and can’t afford the fucking tires.
4473 2018-05-31 16:02:48 There's so much associated gas coming off these wells (without takeaway capacity) that you either flare or shut in the oil well. Texas regulators are getting real antsy about the rising level of flared natgas. Check out local natgas prices for proof. Yet one more Permian issue

4475 2018-05-31 16:02:38 Ok, can we short oil now?
4476 2018-05-31 16:02:35 Since our govt ends today, and new prices of Petrol, Diesel and Kerosene Oil go in effect from tomorrow, therefore on Min of Finance’s recommendation the Prime Minister has decided to leave their prices unchanged till June 7, so that the incoming govt can decide new prices.

4530 2018-05-31 15:58:27 Many things intersect: 1. Failure of muslim societies to come to terms with modernity; 2. middle east was arbitrarily divided after first world war; 3. Western selfish foreign policy for oil; 4. countries like Saudi failed to invest in science to have their own oil technology.
4531 2018-05-31 15:58:25 We don’t need foreign oil in America we have more than enough at home, we import Saudi oil to keep the royal family alive and from other countries because of special business interests that I’m also against. I’m also against spreading democracy, weshould just focus on humanrights
4532 2018-05-31 15:58:23 Not 100% oil and gas. Most offshore gas is in English waters and oil is still being recovered from Wytch Farm in East midlands. Also recent big finds of oil in the Gatwick area

4534 2018-05-31 15:58:18 I am a Chemistry student at the UofA and I have talked to devon energys spokesman. They all know we sell for about half the price.  It hurts. Thats why we need water access.  They have customers who want ethical, "green" oil. The green is due to the fact we have a carbon tax.

So as oil prices spike, we get the majority of our oil from Mexico and Canada, and farmers are devastated, you keep thinking that.

4574 2018-05-31 15:54:26 True, Chabot's 200,000 from oil was mentioned. I guess I just have an issue with putting rhetorical mudslinging on equal footing with actual, monetary conflict of interest.

Not sure why there wasn’t more of an issue at the time

4579 2018-05-31 15:54:00 the banks and oil still remain under pressure. would like to see some improvement there for this /NQ move to stick
4580 2018-05-31 15:53:59 Maybe we will stop exporting Canadian luxury goods like designer lumber, prestige potash, and extra virgin canola oil.
4581 2018-05-31 15:53:59 yes it was, no tax on most things  like the electric power that Canada sell to the US  and fresh water, and oil  now    and the price  gas will just jump most likely  by tomorrow or next week
4582 2018-05-31 15:53:49 Reliance Industries, India, owner of the world’s biggest refining complex, to halt oil imports from Iran to comply with US sanctions.
4583 2018-05-31 15:53:42 It sort of does by neutralizing the Baugh vote. Baugh is the WORST choice. Get him to vote Harley so we don’t have more oil rigs off the coast. To fight rampant corruption. Or so my girls can choose when they are ready for kids.
4584 2018-05-31 15:53:28 This is not good for Canada !!  I hope Canada puts tariffs on some goods imported from the US.  Like Harley Davidson products, Oil, etc

4589 2018-05-31 15:52:55 If Offset woulda bought that man a Bentley y’all woulda said he was dead wrong soon as dude had to get a oil change
4590 2018-05-31 15:52:48 Osea es culpa de Peña?
4591 2018-05-31 15:52:46 Yeah, that’s a good idea. Some oil or butter would do the trick :) or like you said, undercooking it slightly so it can finish cooking in the broth :)
4592 2018-05-31 15:52:44 Closing prices: #Ftse100 0.02% #DAX -1.40% #CAC -0.53% #Estoxx50 -0.75% #GBPUSD 1.3285 #EURGBP 0.8777 #GILTBUND 0.0 #Gold 0.04% #Oil -1.43%
4593 2018-05-31 15:52:38 Well that’s moronic Coal tail Oil movement and Canada demography is quiet screwed up to the point Canada and Saskatchewan help Alberta to gang up BC so they can export their oil to the more expensive international price.
4594 2018-05-31 15:52:31 My car is saying that is needs an oil change, I broke a nail and I look bigger than I thought in this striped dress. In other words I’m ready for bed... 
4595 2018-05-31 15:52:28 Also, your calculus above assumes no real world benefit/geopolitical 2nd derivative impact to controlling physical flows of oil.  If there were no such benefits, I assure you the US military would not have been in the Mideast for the past 60+ yrs.
4596 2018-05-31 15:52:27 ive got some 50billion cfu probiotics, but ive been worse since i started them, sadly, so i stopped, ive tried digestive enzymes, pepsin, peppermint oil capsules, symprove and other stuff, nothing seems to work

4599 2018-05-31 15:52:17 @RepDonBeyer People are missing the point of the Tariffs. First it will increase the use of plastics. Second it tears at the fabric of NATO. Third it will cause an increase in oil prices which is what Putin needs. Kill Iran deal oil goes up, attack Syria oil goes up.
4600 2018-05-31 15:52:12 Exactly or the insurance or hell even the gas n oil changes
4601 2018-05-31 15:52:06 Chuckie, it’s all market based an oil speculators drive the costs not the government.  Chuckie, as usual the truth escapes your lips

4605 2018-05-31 15:51:49 Volume is one of the central considerations here. Remember the immense volume of oil we're talking about here. Alberta's daily production is north of 4 million barrels per day. Oil is what is referred to as a fungible good; it's a commodity. 1/
4606 2018-05-31 15:51:40 I get my oil changed every week. honestly I just like the attention.

4612 2018-05-31 15:50:58 exactly...something practical is better in the long run for someone who can't really drop $500 for an oil change
4613 2018-05-31 15:50:58 global digital ids. That's what Aadhaar was ultimately meant to merge into anyway, scams like @ID2020 funded by WW2 oil sale blood money of @Rockefellerfdn, for WW3 where data will be the new oil.

That's also why Aadhaar was not a proof of citizenship. It is for global id scam.

4619 2018-05-31 15:50:24 Gas prices go up 60 cents in  the last two weeks. Time for the president to put an end to this summer blend price increase crap. Also time to stop exporting our oil period. If the Arans can't sell their oil to us? Who will they sell it to. Simple math. Supply and demand.

4621 2018-05-31 15:50:08 Lol went to clicks and I now have 3 small bottles of Argan Oil . Whipped out my calculator tho, it was cheaper than buying 1 bigger bottle.
4622 2018-05-31 15:50:04 Made banana muffins w/mayo instead of eggs/oil and they came out AMAZING! It's a nice sub in case you don't have eggs. Yes, I know mayo is eggs & oil but have you tried mayo in your muffins?
4623 2018-05-31 15:49:51 Also small box with marmite/ coffee/ tea/ sugar/ oil and any other ‘can’t do withouts’.
4624 2018-05-31 15:49:42 Exactly. 1) Offset's money, Offset's damn choice and 2) He obvi bought the man something he could likely afford to maintain. Those luxury cars cost a grip for basic repairs and even things like oil changes.
4625 2018-05-31 15:49:34 India's GDP grew by 6.7% in FY17-18. This is almost same as the growth in the last year of UPA2. So at the end of four years of low oil price and global growth, this is where we are. Looking forward to analysis by leading economists....

4633 2018-05-31 15:48:54 Yeah, I tend to be hostile when a snake oil salesman claims sexist prejudices are rational and blamed men's violence on women. It's one of those things. And feeds hysterical lies about trans activism. My question is: if you already assume he's a victim, why don't you read him?

4637 2018-05-31 15:48:46 Great-Creating dependency since Russia has exported oil to NK.Dependency creates leverage that Russia could use in future negotiations with China or the United States. Will Pyongyang and Washington go to war? Russia has reason to help Pyongyang. They both suffer same plan idea.
4638 2018-05-31 15:48:41 Umm no... if China “swaps” dollars for oil then these dollars go to oil exporting countries, right?! Which then park the excess dollars at central bank which in turn parks them in treasurys.. it’s flow of funds 101

4644 2018-05-31 15:48:07 Or no deal. All our economists agrees that while not ideal, we'd still be fine without #NAFTA. Maybe we should cut out the reciprocity clause on oil... just like the Mexican when they refused it. You'd no longer be guaranteed Canadian oil...fyi, we're your biggest supplier
4645 2018-05-31 15:47:59 Societé Generale 1/3: Yesterday's @bankofcanada meeting suggests a rate hike is indeed possible this summer and reinforces my belief that shorting #USDCAD anywhere near 1.30 should work unless oil prices collapse. #forex #fx

4653 2018-05-31 15:47:26 Yes, you are correct not many people realize we don't even need the amendment. Most of the founders thought it was self explanatory, but others thought; in the future someone might try and debate the meaning, so it was added. It is unalienable not giving can't be taken.

4656 2018-05-31 15:47:14 No, bc it owes its people USD-denominated goods/services/bribes to avoid rioting (see Saudi oil breakeven price.)  So USD's migrate to US companies who buy UST's...ahead of US deficits destroying the real value of those UST's.  UST's becoming "hot potato" instead of reserve asset

4658 2018-05-31 15:46:53 Brilliant sir!
It's like we all just wipe the edge of the bottle after pouring oil but hardly any1 thinks about the solution simply caused by the viscosity of the liquid inside.

4661 2018-05-31 15:46:39 oh good! do you have a gas hook up or are you on oil?
4662 2018-05-31 15:46:26 How can that possibly happen while entities like Fox are allowed to continue manufacturing news? It's like trying to clean up up the oil spill on the surface without plugging the massive hole leaking the oil.
4663 2018-05-31 15:46:16 Not convinced oil is ready to bounce yet. More likely to go range-bound until some if the OPEC+ uncertainty clears up. Still thought yesterday's bounce was a short covering rally.
Inventory was at least a positive for the bulls.

4680 2018-05-31 15:44:25 Accountable for higher gas prices? So tone deaf again! His actions in the Middle East have crushed rogue operators like ISIS and set straight policy with respect to Iran as we all know you agree. Oil prices are down 8% in the last week as well btw
4681 2018-05-31 15:44:15 If Michael Rowland’s was involved in the oil business his comments might actually mean something. Obviously crude won’t ‘make its way’ to Asia if the market doesn’t exist. Asian refineries, like all others, purchase the lowest priced crude they can and are crying for Canadian.

4686 2018-05-31 15:43:46 We're so stupid that we sell oil at a discount to the US and buy Saudi oil to refine in Montreal because our idiot public doesn't want to build energy east.
4687 2018-05-31 15:43:41 They've been good, but sustainable owners. They aren't oil money we know that but they funded the clubs losses for the initial period before they turned us into a profitable club. They have made big mistakes but have taken us in the right direction and sustainably.
4688 2018-05-31 15:43:14 There is a point to be made about the potency of oil, but everything else here is wrong.
4689 2018-05-31 15:42:55 Meh there is only 53 years of oil left anyway... We'll be lucky if we push it up another degree.

4695 2018-05-31 15:41:42 Yea.. i mean, if we take his extreme example with China using all its usd reserves to buy oil, clearly now the reserves have migrated to the central bank of the country that has sold oil.. and it replaces China as buyer of treasurys
4696 2018-05-31 15:41:38 @RBReich  The point of the Tariffs. First it will increase the use of plastics. Second it tears at the fabric of NATO. Third it will cause an increase in oil prices which is what Putin needs. Drop Iran deal raise oil prices for Putin, attack in  oil up.

4703 2018-05-31 15:41:14 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

4705 2018-05-31 15:41:04 #oott US ' crude oil ' production rose from 8.7 mill bpd to 10.7 mill bpd whereas gasoline production just rose 0.2% from 9.992 mill bpd to 10015 mill bpd. Where ist the gasoline? Looks like there is no gasoline in shale oil. No wonder WTI tanks.#crudeoil#wti#brent#gasoline

4714 2018-05-31 15:40:05 OK, but  the lost tax revenue is a small fraction of the cost to the oil companies, right? Also, if rail did not replace pipelines, the amount lost because of that would be less, I think. In short, I'm wondering if the cost to CA and AB is overestimated in these studies.
4715 2018-05-31 15:40:04 Will do. I've never had to wait that long for an oil change

4725 2018-05-31 15:39:06 Evan-Do you see the irony in our possible retaliation to Trump Tariffs of Ontario Steel, Aluminum,  Auto’s. Parts, as well as BC Softwood Lumber?
Suggested  retaliation would be Oil Export tax or limiting the amount of Alberta Oil going to USA. Yet no East pipeline. 
Insane !

4742 2018-05-31 15:37:35 Biggest lesson for me, was reading labels thoroughly. No pickles as they are pickled with wht distilled vinegar. Beware of French fries, as they are fried in oil with breaded foods. 5Guys fries are safe.

4744 2018-05-31 15:37:29 CBD oil is a lot less expensive (usually less than $100) and has been known to help cure cancer. If you know someone in a state where cannabis is legal, they can access it for you.

4748 2018-05-31 15:37:10 @SRuhle you are missing the point of the Tariffs. First it will increase the use of plastics. Second it tears at the fabric of NATO. Third it will cause an increase in oil prices which is what Putin needs.
4749 2018-05-31 15:37:07 A guy on the phone with me at work scheduling an oil change kept telling me I’m sexy and asked me to take my break when he comes in.. I’m so uncomfortable #creepyoldmen #pleasestop #strangerdanger
4750 2018-05-31 15:37:05 I’ve changed my oil change appointment from 8am to 10am to 12pm , the man said “Baby just bring it in whenever you feel like it”  the procrastination is in my adulthood 
4751 2018-05-31 15:37:01 How about tomorrow afternoon? Bachelor party house near Lucas Oil... book it
4752 2018-05-31 15:36:53 Thanks Russil. I can send you a PDF of "The Tar Sands Campaign" produced and paid for by Tides and The Rockefeller Foundation. They targeted AB in 2008, & have spent millions demonizing Alberta. The goal is to break the AB economy by locking in AB oil.

4762 2018-05-31 15:35:46 Just so you know, Trump believes he has an ace up his sleeve.  Expect the reformation of the oil industry to be bragged about next.  

What he doesn't realise is that the long term effects of this may lead to another EU + british oil market crash.
4763 2018-05-31 15:35:46 My father had zero side effects from chemo or radiation, it just didn’t work. However, 6 mo. of cannabis oil treatments shrunk the tumors in his brain and lungs down to almost nothing.

4765 2018-05-31 15:35:30 In line for an oil change, an employee hopped behind the wheel of the car in front of me and yelled "RAMMING SPEED" and that's going to be the funniest part of my week.
4766 2018-05-31 15:35:27 USA steel tariffs will increase steel prices in the USA.

Such higher steel prices may indirectly increase oil prices, given that USA shale producers consume lots of steel on a daily basis.

And USA manufacturers who use lots of steel will struggle to compete abroad.
4767 2018-05-31 15:35:05 Help I had an accident with Tangerine oil and now everything smells like freshly peeled tangerine

Normally I wouldn't complain but the heat in combination with any strong smell fucks me up
4768 2018-05-31 15:35:02 U.S. Crude #Oil inventories DECREASED much more than expected for week ended May25 according to today’s EIA data. $CL_F stockpiles fell by 3.6 million barrels (vs. 300k estimate) to 434.5 million barrels, and are still in the lower half of the average range for this time of year!
4769 2018-05-31 15:35:01 Oil institutional signal triggered as well
4770 2018-05-31 15:34:47 Big oil is stupid if they do not lower gas prices coming into midterms. . Oil trading at $67 a barrel. Well below necessity for today’s price.
4771 2018-05-31 15:34:41 There are enough reserves in Texas to fuel the entire US demand for the next 50yrs. However, it’s really deep and relatively expensive to extract. Markets can be great conserving institutions. When the last economic drop of oil is extracted from Saudi, we will still have plenty.
4772 2018-05-31 15:34:36 Fall out from the collapse of OPEC unity. If oil prices recede where does that leave oil export dependent economies, and those who serve them.

I have NO illusions about tRump it’s the tRumpettes that form the acolyte train behind him, buying every drop of snake oil, blinding yourselves to reality in order to keep him on your pedestal. It’s called a metaphor. Another teachable moment there.
4779 2018-05-31 15:34:09 I’m joining the oil field
4780 2018-05-31 15:34:00 I tried an at home wax kit once (DO NOT ATTEMPT) and got the wax EVERYWHERE including inside the toilet. Ended up having to just scrape off the goop with a knife, even the oil remover they included didn't work.
4781 2018-05-31 15:33:58 How do you reconcile this with committing Canada to the oil business when we should be phasing out fossil fuels in favour of renewable energy?

You can't take only the fishes from water & throw away it's dirts anyhow. Fishes should be taken,ya but it's dirts should equally be taken to where it ought to.
4788 2018-05-31 15:33:42 Being the polite Canadians we are...@realDonaldTrump, please resign. You are causing irreparable damage to your once great nation. We will be fine as we can sell our resources elsewhere. Oil and water is what you need from us. This will be our retaliation. Taps turned off.
4789 2018-05-31 15:33:30 The reason our oil is discounted is because we don’t have enough pipeline capacity. We can produce more than we can sell so producers underbid each other. The location of the port is irrelevant. We just need more pipelines. There are many other factors that affect world price.
4790 2018-05-31 15:33:26 The Calgary Stampede is where Canadian politicians--perhaps some in the pockets of oil companies--can have "impromptu" meetings with key players to move forward agendas. Undercover investigative reporters should flock there this year. #transparency

4795 2018-05-31 15:33:08 It is a remarkable achievement and stock market investors are happy about it. But, aam aadmi, who make the bulk, don't understand the unstoppable spiralling oil price and it's burden. Today's bye poll results reflect that.

4804 2018-05-31 15:32:16 Canada's Prime Minister Trudeau is nationalizing a pipeline to the west coast in order to bring Tar Sand Oil to market at a much reduced cost. Next up, maybe Trudeau will nationalize the Energy East Pipeline.

Also, this data is only an activity map of completions, correct? Would be amazing to render fluid production through time (red for gas, green for oil, blue for water). You have that data? I am mesmerized just thinking about it.

4816 2018-05-31 15:31:24 Actually the increase in gas prices is not due to foreign policy... it is very complicated.  I have also been in the oil business my entire life.  Your assumption is false.

4826 2018-05-31 15:30:30 One of the most interesting aspects of @theturner's book "The Patch" is his description of how the oil sands got onto the radar of the environmental movement, and became a scapegoat for climate change.

4835 2018-05-31 15:30:03 I spent two and a half months in Puerto Rico with no electricity it cost me 33 to $35 every 3 days to run my generator 3 hours in the morning and 4 hours in the evening. Gas and oil companies got richer by raising their prices during a catastrophe. A lot of people are suffering.
4836 2018-05-31 15:29:59 When I was in Tex in 2010 it was when they had tht big oil leak in gulf. It was scary down there as we struggled to stop the leak & clean up the shores.They say the water is brown down there.
4837 2018-05-31 15:29:52 To be honest, it was a mindful process for me 
Before finding my own balance between being present when I can (and the world will not stop) and engaging mindfully online & offline, there were periods that had me glued to the screen or burning the midnight oil catching up

Some are blaming @Kathleen_Wynne for Trump's blatant misunderstanding of basic economics; using tariffs that will threaten millions of American jobs from the production of cars, boats, oil and gas extraction to beer cans and golf clubs and everything in between.
4852 2018-05-31 15:28:47 RT @TankerTrackers: WOW! Check out the US oil production! It's up by nearly 1 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY since the beginning of the year! That's how much higher 2017 ended the year with, and we're not even in June!

4860 2018-05-31 15:28:17 How’s this: At current USD price of oil, total US Federal obligations are equivalent to roughly 120 yrs of 100% of global oil supplies.  So China’s just directly swapping USD surpluses for physical oil.
4861 2018-05-31 15:28:15 got gas & my oil changed, just had lunch and i’m at home wat bing real housewives and it’s still A.M. wow. i feel accomplished

4863 2018-05-31 15:28:12 They have been paying Iran in barter  since Ahmadinejad agreed to do this when China was massively short dollars (through need to repay Euro$ loans) & Iran was a distressed oil seller. This is functionally no different to settling in Yuan.

4885 2018-05-31 15:26:13 History has recorded that this industry has been subsidized from the beginning, yet the oil companies pay large dividends to their shareholders.

4896 2018-05-31 15:25:35 It dosent help that the interworkings of computers are not transparent, which makes it more difficult to explain how systems need to be maintained. Your car might work perfectly, but the oil still needs to be changed every 3K miles.
4897 2018-05-31 15:25:31 Or at least an olive oil one

4908 2018-05-31 15:24:27 We're supposed to be reassured by analysts saying "Although it has been said oil might go to $100 per barrel, oil  analyst Ashley Kelty at Cantor Fitzgerald said that it was very unlikely that it would surpass $90." That would mean fuel at £1.40 +av at the pumps @HowardCCox

4922 2018-05-31 15:23:31 "free" is not accurate. I wan't public tax revenue to go toward improved public services not oil industry infrastructure and corporate welfare subsidies.
4923 2018-05-31 15:23:29 What would happen if the USA said we stop buying Cdn oil. Yes, it might be hard on them but for us, doomsday. The Liberal idiots think they are negotiating from a point of strength, we’re not, we are small and weak. But hey, let’s throw gender issues in there too.

4927 2018-05-31 15:23:09 85c is a hefty increase. That can be calculated, but I wonder on what do they base their forecast for the next month which will be announced in July? There is no data yet as it depends only on the Rand exchange rate and the oil price during June. Looks like a guess.

4932 2018-05-31 15:22:46 Same here.
When oil price crash, they don’t even bother reducing the price at the pumps. 

And when oil price goes back up, they just conveniently raised it.

4941 2018-05-31 15:22:07 We need to be regulating oil pipelines by requiring a redundant pipe around every inch of existing pipe to contain spills. Can be done using all U.S. sourced metals. Would be job heaven.

4947 2018-05-31 15:21:48 When you say that blocking pipelines is costly, because of foregone production and lower oil prices, that means it's costly to the oil companies, right? Not Canada, or Alberta, except possibly for foregone tax revenue? And would the same amount of oil be shipped by rail?

4959 2018-05-31 15:20:41 A1. Oil-rich countries are making money thru the global plastic industry without taking responsibilty for the waste. The plastic chain is a rip-off. Developing nations import plastic pellets from oil producing countries to manufacture plastics that causes pollution

4961 2018-05-31 15:20:39 Which means OPEC will be pressured to pump more. Unless they're happy to lose more market share because US oil production is real. Me thinks there will be even more pumping.
4962 2018-05-31 15:20:37 Is there a way to take me out of this string without unfollowing or blocking people? Everytime a post happens 24 people see your update on a topic spun so far from original I have nothing to add good day to all
4963 2018-05-31 15:20:33 Time to slap some extra charges on our lumber and oil going to the states along with the pharmaceutical
4964 2018-05-31 15:20:31 true that but believe me boo every leader is. the reason why these rich ass arab leaders don't do any shit for the syrians or palestinians is because they have a contract with the US. The US gets his oil the sheikhs their money. it's sad.
4965 2018-05-31 15:20:30 LMAO!
4966 2018-05-31 15:20:24 And how about your engines? Oil consumption prevention in latest models?

4970 2018-05-31 15:20:00 I thought about that. The book as Rand’s personal fantasy is one thing, but the story lacks any kind of prior discussion between the two characters themselves. So I think when you move from book to film you introduce a different scenario.

4975 2018-05-31 15:18:56 Canada's PM without consulting Canadian taxpayers just bot an old pipeline with no guarantee its expansion would even go ahead. Now he has total control to not proceed with expansion or ultimately shut off the taps. Oil patch better be wary of what just happened  @MichelleRempel

4977 2018-05-31 15:18:36 So maybe if we all just start appending both to their tweets, we can do it.
4978 2018-05-31 15:18:35 @realDonaldTrump could we take a look at our rising gas prices to help the American people keep a little more in their pocket. Oil companies release their qrtly earning which is astonishing but we are paying 3.00 a gallon with no cost of living increases? Confused..
4979 2018-05-31 15:18:31 this means oil price rise will not impact growth,what a new theory,direct correlation is increase in Tax kitty

4991 2018-05-31 15:17:49 Coconut Oil smells awful
4992 2018-05-31 15:17:40 Day 5 using @NaturesUltra CBD Oil and I feel fantastic. Still taking it 3 times daily but I didn't have any trouble sleeping last night. Figured out I need to take it an hour or 2 before bed instead of RIGHT before bed. #CBD #CBDOil #CBDoils #CBDLife
4993 2018-05-31 15:17:37 shane hated me being 3 hours away in knoxville bc “he didn’t know if i was safe” (really he was afraid i’d meet someone else) but now that i’m moving here he wants to get an offshore oil job for 10 months of the year cool
4994 2018-05-31 15:17:24 Price..I don't think the refineries want to import oil around $80..no margins there for them:)
4995 2018-05-31 15:17:15 nails, eyebrows and oil changed all before work at 12. I’m feeling good today

4998 2018-05-31 15:16:51 Why do preppers only concentrate on one type of disaster? Pandemics (includes zombies), volcanic activity, alien attacks, seismic catastrophes, EMPs, genetic modified food, oil shortness etc. do they look at each other and think the other ones are crazy?
4999 2018-05-31 15:16:51 IPP are producing electricity more then 13000 MW...and elites have shared and ownership in  IPPs. Now being common man my concern is only 20 or less is hydro...rest is coal or oil based....we are being looted and there is no water as India is building dams.

5003 2018-05-31 15:16:35 Study 2:3 Instead of the oil or myrrh, the Targum says it was the oil of unripe olives which caused the hair to fall off, and rendered the skin delicate.

5006 2018-05-31 15:16:15 Nice t-bone, little salt and pepper, hot cast iron pan with some oil,. Sear 2 minutes on each side, render the fat, 3 minutes in a hot oven. Finish with butter and a sprig of thyme. Beautiful medium rare dinner. I'd serve with slightly lumpy mashed potatoes and a Caesar salad.

5010 2018-05-31 15:15:40 Don't forget the oil is extracted from tar Sands and cost at least $40 per barrel to product. Then we need to buy 1/3 of dilutant to 1b of bitumen. And bitumen is not $60. Light sweet crude oil is. Not dirty Alberta bitumen. You should be looking at profit not gross
5011 2018-05-31 15:15:39 I tried to get #AmbulanceChasers trending on them but it never caught on.
5012 2018-05-31 15:15:22 Shea Moisture overnight face oil. Few drops on your face before you go to bed and you wake up glowing
5013 2018-05-31 15:15:18 #crude oil So we used our refineries at maximum capacity and finished product is at higher inventory while unrefined crude inventory is lower. Lower imports because we export? This looks a little overrated for the bulls.

5015 2018-05-31 15:15:14 People on here are damn racist happy about that invasion of a continent. Colonization then and neo colonization today has messed Africa. Taking all the resources to gain profit. All the gold, diamonds, oil, etc. Sick people.
5016 2018-05-31 15:15:13 @nenshi BC didn't cost Canada 4.5 Billion, Alberta did because you refuse to diversify your economy. Nobody wants your dirty oil. We certainly don't want it washing up on our shores.

5022 2018-05-31 15:14:59 I make my own "Gnarly" brownies.  Use chocolate brownie mix, grind up product in a coffee grinder to almost dust, mix/infuse oil portion with product overnight.  Bake according to package.  Cheap and easy.  You Tube is a great resource.
5023 2018-05-31 15:14:56 well then perhaps you're in need of an oil change :)
5024 2018-05-31 15:14:56 Well saudi arabia has the third largest natural resources after Russian & the us not just oil and gas

5032 2018-05-31 15:13:57 Conservatives should be demanding a cleanup of their Northern Alberta mess instead they are supporting Tar sand expansion in Cold Lake. Do Albertans know what the governments have planned. Be truthful why "in oil we trust" will not work.
5033 2018-05-31 15:13:56 Siempre es oportunidad mientras el oil continue su tendencia alcista de mediano plazo y los rigs sigan subiendo. La empresa es muy solida.

5048 2018-05-31 15:12:52 I read the same thing about oil/petrol as well recently. Even if the oil companies were to sell it at something crazy like 5 cents a gallon, the would still be making a 100% profit margin.
5049 2018-05-31 15:12:52 Nothing. More. Like gimme my oil change and let me live man

5055 2018-05-31 15:12:28 Also I'm not so sure about sustainable palm oil, surely we should be changing the ingredients so we don't need the ingredient at all, but I'm guessing it's possibly not that simple.

5106 2018-05-31 15:09:35 The US gets much of its crude oil from Canada. Canada shares security intel/responsibility with the US, with whom it shares the longest undefended border. Trump has decided to impose a draconian and unnecessary tariff on Canada. Smart deal? I suspect not.
5107 2018-05-31 15:09:34 Must work to lower gas prices now that US is becoming major producer of oil. @SecretaryPerry @RyanZinke @EPAScottPruitt @realDonaldTrump

5151 2018-05-31 15:06:54 Wtf does fox know about gas prices? Try OPEC and middle eastern turmoil moron. Btw the only reason gas prices were down before is because saudis flooded the market with oil. You should never trust market insight from talking heads on fox or CNBC. They’re journalists not analysts.
5152 2018-05-31 15:06:42 They’re hysterical. We for first time now are world’s greatest producer of oil. I’m in the industry. Believe me gas prices will be going down. The numbers don’t lie. Our economy is best it’s been in years. Hating Trump won’t change that.

5277 2018-05-31 14:59:07 The taxes are govt rules that don't fluctuate. It's the price of crude oil that fluctuates. Read any article on internet why Modi didn't reduce oil prices and you will understand. Even hardcore Modi haters accept this fact.

5289 2018-05-31 14:57:43 Not according to Andrew Weaver. Maybe you heard of him? He calculated burning ALL oil in the sands ( not just recoverable) will have negligible impact on global temps.

5309 2018-05-31 14:55:48 And who will account for trade defecit which the UPA was passing on year after year. The recent increase is bcoz of increase in crude prices due international tensions. The UPA was subsidising oil prices which had effect on other commodities. Hence inflation during UPA

5312 2018-05-31 14:55:27 Government bond prices ended lower as rise in crude oil prices strengthened fear of higher inflation and RBI rate hike on Jun 6. Rise in US yields also disrupted appetite. Mood however remained cautious before GDP growth data later today.
5313 2018-05-31 14:55:12 At current oil consumption rates, the reserves found in the global supply of tar sands will last about 2 more generations. W/o a change to new forms of energy, or discovery of new crude reserves, we will be faced with shortages in about 40 years.

5361 2018-05-31 14:51:34 ~90% of all firearm deaths are gang/drug, felon on felon crimes. That leaves about 1250 total deaths per year, that includes accidental, and justifiable, including law enforcement. Outside of gangs, firearm homicide is VERY rare.

5373 2018-05-31 14:50:33 @Varneyco Zinke is not correct on oil and gas production increases.  In 2015 the price of oil had dropped to $40 a bbl.  Oil production dropped 1.1 million bbl a day.  He's not informed if he thinks we can get oil to 14 mil pd with less than $65 to $70.  We use 18 mil a day BYTW.
5374 2018-05-31 14:50:33 Libs still don't get that everything they say and do is recoverable on some form of media...stupid is as stupid does... but a suggestion on high gas prices...we need to build more refineries...our production is low so prices are high...need to require oil companies to do this

5388 2018-05-31 14:49:09 Take The Heat… Refine The Crude.
 Crude oil takes the “heat of discovery” to be uncovered yet it is  still CRUDE! Totally useless!  But Men know what to do; they REFINE it.
5389 2018-05-31 14:49:06 Why not? Credit was flowing into EMs, infra and real estate boom. Only oil was the worry which govt of that time subsidized.  This govt benefited by low oil prices but credit is not cheap anymore and add domestic NPA crisis which makes it hard for govt to stimulate the economy

5400 2018-05-31 14:48:23 1/ I am struggling to understand that after decades of apparently selling our oil to a single buyer  therefore selling at a discount, all of a sudden in the twilight of the boom, we are now hell-bent on getting oil to tidewater. Additionally why QC has been importing oil?
5401 2018-05-31 14:48:16 97% of canada's proved oil reserve is stored in the oil sands!! And 99% of our oil export goes to the USA and with trump in office he keeps on threatening canadian exports already with heavy fines and levies...

5411 2018-05-31 14:47:15 Solid economic growth in the U.S. and abroad has helped push up prices for oil, lumber, cotton and many other commodities this year.
5412 2018-05-31 14:47:12 @JustinTrudeau stop playing with this clown and tax the oil they need so badly. Make them pay $5 a gallon like we do
5413 2018-05-31 14:46:58 I usually go with a vegetable oil, but this sounds interesting.
5414 2018-05-31 14:46:50 Our oil revenue from exports is down 32% globally in from 2012-2017 already even though we still export the 3rd most oil globally... Still seem like a valuable investment of tax dollars?

But that isn't politically possible right now and pipelines beat railcars environmentally and economically.

5499 2018-05-31 14:40:30 Generally, they don't like it at all... 

Could always check with FDA if you're unsure. I don't think the oil is concentrated enough to cause any adverse effects, on the other hand.

5507 2018-05-31 14:39:53 He is sent out by the swamp to appease the conservative masses. Stopped buying his snake oil a long time ago.
5508 2018-05-31 14:39:51 President Trump will do more to help inner city communities than the snake oil socialist preacher did in eight years. Because, he actually cares. He get called racist as a proactive defense measure so that when he starts delivering big time they will have blunted the excitement.

5515 2018-05-31 14:39:16 He was convicted by a federal judge, not "Obama." Trumpers and facts, like water and oil.
5516 2018-05-31 14:38:59 High gas prices are a good thing considering everything in Texas follows the the oil field.
5517 2018-05-31 14:38:59 Those so called  tax cuts, you didn't think that was going back into your pocket or infrastructure,...no that's going right into the 1% and Big Oil's pockets and stock buy backs.
5518 2018-05-31 14:38:55 That’s with the heart does  Update me with your progress! It makes me wish there would have been CBD Oil available to help my last dog Nickie... 
5519 2018-05-31 14:38:47 Hit back with 50% tariffs on oil exports to the US!
5520 2018-05-31 14:38:43 What to include in a marinade is super confusing. I've read that it doesn't ever make sense to add oil because it won't penetrate the watery meat (no euphemism intended!). What do you think?
5521 2018-05-31 14:38:42 Is that an oil? And yea I’ll likely make an appointment to get it looked at.
5522 2018-05-31 14:38:39 No, your meme is clearly a meme, automatically suspect by its nature, the other was actual data, from which anyone can draw conclusions. BTW, your Walmart meme is a false equivalence argument.

5528 2018-05-31 14:37:47 This conflict in Cameroon is NOT about 'language'. It's an ECONOMIC war. It's a war  about access to resources (crude oil) under the soil of the  predominantly English-speaking people of Cameroon
5529 2018-05-31 14:37:45 @JustinTrudeau due 2 the new tarrifs that asshat @realDonaldTrump  is rolling out now on steel & aluminum. Plz cut off all water supplies they get from us, plus the hydro they get from us & oil ect.... Yes, this also includes maple syrup! #IReallyCantStandCheetos
5530 2018-05-31 14:37:42 I think that US interest rates and crude oil prices are key to everything.
5531 2018-05-31 14:37:38 An assumption? Ask me about shale sometime. Your relationship with your mother is yours alone, but I would  to go deep into oil production in the North Sea with you one of these days.
5532 2018-05-31 14:37:38 I didn’t know you played hockey! Vitamin E oil or cream, available at any drugstore.
5533 2018-05-31 14:37:26 Turn off the oil tap.
5534 2018-05-31 14:37:25 Oh yes, that was brilliant - you guys really went all out. Can't believe how long ago that was. Let me apply my Oil of Olay.
5535 2018-05-31 14:37:20 Kill the oil treaty and start charging market rates
5536 2018-05-31 14:37:14 at least he put oil on the pan before frying the egg like a decent person 
5537 2018-05-31 14:37:06 I wouldn't call a low-carb, high fat diet 'strict', Kevin.  Meat, fish, eggs, any green veg, cheese, butter, olive oil, berries, full fat yogurt, eat till full, no calorie counting at all. Low carb, high fat=zero hunger!
5538 2018-05-31 14:37:02 Worked at a deli, one time the catch for the fry oil didnt stick whee we fry chicken (it was cooled) it spilled everywhere and i slipped in it and was covered hesd to toe in chicken grease. Also my manager was not very nice so i quit shortly afterwards.
5539 2018-05-31 14:36:53 Though, aren't cats sensitive to citrus in general? I'm just worried that if he does still eat my plants + citrus oil, it'll make him sicker than if I just left it off in the first place. :T
5540 2018-05-31 14:36:39 Time for our government to step up and fight back, hydro, lumber , water & oil can all cost Americans more now.
5541 2018-05-31 14:36:32 The US is a net oil *exporting* nation now. We don't need Mexican oil.

Keep up!
5542 2018-05-31 14:36:23 เหมือนโดนตบหน้าากลาง 4 แยก
5543 2018-05-31 14:36:00 Time to upcharge the oil.    #canada #usa
5544 2018-05-31 14:35:59 I'm 45 years old and I love my dealership because they provide free juice boxes while I wait for my oil change.
5545 2018-05-31 14:35:55 How about we flay a pedophile alive? Or boiled in oil?
5546 2018-05-31 14:35:44 "Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise them up." ~ James 5:14-15.
5547 2018-05-31 14:35:36 what's missing today? Both housing & autos which account for a lot of trucking tonnage are at much lower levels since 08 than before 08 on GDPs that are 1/2 of 08 levels. What is this tonnage on? Shale/oil? I'd like to understand it better before deciding economy is more robust.
5548 2018-05-31 14:35:28 Just gifted our new staff member some oil to take home #happybunny #oliveoil #foodie #goodfood #greekoil #greekcuisine #artisan #artisanoil #farmersmarket #import #achaea
5549 2018-05-31 14:35:28 This is the one you RUINED with that spare tire on the trunk? You should be ashamed. Heads up on that BIG oil spill
5550 2018-05-31 14:35:16 Well, in the end win matters. BJP needs to be more grounded and assess ground realities. It is high time they re-visit oil prices. Also, they need to understand what people want (particularly in the lower end of the spectrum) and avoid any controversial initiatives.
5551 2018-05-31 14:35:06 hard assets are those that are hard to create quickly - you can double the supply of money overnight - oil supply has increased substantially because of shale - copper doubled from end-08 to 2011
5552 2018-05-31 14:35:06 They don’t “need” our oil but they buy it at 15-25% less than WTI and resell it at WTI. This doesn’t factor in that WCS sells for Canadian $$ and they get a 30-35% DISCOUNT because of the disparity of our follars
5553 2018-05-31 14:34:59 @JustinTrudeau should slap a tariff of 50% on oil exports to the US.

But there are Bigger problems Such as Global warming, Pollution, sex slaves, terrorism, Poverty, Drug Mafia, corruption that we must solve instead of distracting everyone &Modi for our small gains.plz
5556 2018-05-31 14:34:53 The impact of gas must have been huge - all the data I have seen is that oil production fell substantially between 2015 and 2017.
5557 2018-05-31 14:34:44 baby oil babe x

5560 2018-05-31 14:34:24 I am sure their fixing petrol somewhere it can't only be economic climate and oil. Same as banks we are exploited here
5561 2018-05-31 14:34:18 I've got tangerine oil on hand! Might try that just to get the vinegar smell off of everything at least lol
5562 2018-05-31 14:34:18 WTI oil at $67.51/barrel, -$0.70.
5563 2018-05-31 14:34:16 They can get their Oil & Gas from that nice Mr Putin their WhiskEy from equally nice Mr Trump and maybe the Argentines will give them some beef 
5564 2018-05-31 14:34:10 The oil is alive, not EZ.
5565 2018-05-31 14:34:05 It’s too early I done wasted oil and everything. Oh well
5566 2018-05-31 14:34:04 Now we know where some of the anti pipe line support money comes from. I think it's economy not ecology driven. The US is our only customer for oil at a very low price, more customers via pipe line , price will go up.  Also is  Mr, Gore still involved in brokering carbon credits?
5567 2018-05-31 14:34:03 Meditation is highly recommended with lavender tea or chamomile. Also doing a lavender oil diffuser and some nature water sounds. Water always soothes me
5568 2018-05-31 14:34:00 Ek bat btao Rohit bhai......agar pehle petrol aur diesel ₹60-65/litter tha to fir oil exporter countries ka ₹45000 cr ka karz kese ho gya hmare Desh pr ? Mujhe lgta h aaj tak join krne ke bad aap common sense ka km use krne lge h.
5569 2018-05-31 14:33:49 A nie wiem, coś ok 2 tygodni ale używam też bio oil i różnych innych i nic nie działa. Może nie powinnam tak zmieniać ale chce się tego jak najszybciej pozbyć 
5570 2018-05-31 14:33:48 but we should not be spending $bns in order to grow oil&gas in the changing global economy & warming. We should resist putting massive $ into oil&gas going forward and instead work to grow renewables more.
5571 2018-05-31 14:33:47 AKA....you can never know some1...everyday is a learning curve. Today its rocks tomorrow it will be some anointing oil or Holy water from somewhere......and the list goes on. #thingswedoforlove

5575 2018-05-31 14:32:46 The oil change procedure on my GTI was hysterical.

5582 2018-05-31 14:31:56 What if I were to tell you that I can show you 700 years of data that show the same thing? In fact, ever since the first wheel-lock pistol, crime has risen with the restriction of firearms and fallen when they were readily available.
5583 2018-05-31 14:31:47 Oil and Pharma drove our automated investment returns Feb to now, while banks underperformed
5584 2018-05-31 14:31:45 Identify the PSU who really contributed by developing indigenous technology. It's not only the profit. PSU having reach to natural resource like coal, oil or minerals are not in the same bracket as some of the PSU who r engineering excellence centre.. preserve them
5585 2018-05-31 14:31:38 I hardly ever bother with the actual deep fryer, a wok or large frying pan filled 1/3 full is perfect - if the oil isn’t too clouded you can filter it through kitchen paper and a funnel and use it another couple of times usually
5586 2018-05-31 14:31:35 There is no Asian premium. I've written about this several times. Oil is a fungible commodity and sells for the same price around world minus transport costs. But shipping to Asia would avoid glut of heavy in US market + pipeline constraints that cause $32 differential.
5587 2018-05-31 14:31:23 We supply 30 percent of their oil.
5588 2018-05-31 14:31:14 mark wtf you put oil and the egg before turning on the stove???? what
5589 2018-05-31 14:31:05 $I fake reminds me a lot of the $ZN farce. A lot of hype/ talk to pump up the price artificially but in the end there is no oil. This is the same scheme...Pump it up and hype it so the big dogs can sell their large positions. But in the end, it's bs. Buy the rumor, sell the news.
5590 2018-05-31 14:30:58 Another eastern power ploy! Another betrayal by Ottawa? Trudeau serves Masters who do not have western interest at heart! To the French apologize for not destroying my countries economic viability fast enough! I will kill Canadian oil! By paying companies not to invest in Canada!
5591 2018-05-31 14:30:48 Petrol stations are not accountable for petrol price hike, boycotting them won’t necessarily make much of a difference, since petrol price is influenced by the economic climate & the price of oil.
5592 2018-05-31 14:30:43 he put oil now before putting the egg im proud of you mark lee
5593 2018-05-31 14:30:43 Except metastudies have proven your statement incorrect. I provided you with multiple links to very stringent research and the findings. Yet you continue with this failed concept by using a strawman approach.
5594 2018-05-31 14:30:30 thought he LOVEDDDDD Macron? Canada supplies lot's of oil to US, watch prices of gas climb!

5597 2018-05-31 14:30:16 @OpenText the time to stop an industry is b4 it generates $200B plus per year... stop being a jerk .... expansion in the oil sands is waning... but you can't harm what is already there.... #IRRESPONSIBLE
5598 2018-05-31 14:30:05 @POTUS IDEA FOR MEXICO/NAFTA: Halt ALL transfer payments going to Mexico via wire, etc... that is their second biggest source of revenue after oil and bring their economy to a halt. They’ll come to the table. BTW, great job, sir! Don’t ever stop fighting!
5599 2018-05-31 14:30:00 trump broke the deal with Iran, which we were getting oil from. When the supply goes down the price goes up.
5600 2018-05-31 14:29:49 Having a car is cool until you have to get an inspection..or an oil change...or a registration sticker...or new breaks...or pay for gas.

5608 2018-05-31 14:28:49 Try orange oil instead. Or you know, any citrus peel oils... 
Natural pesticide. 

Limonene for us chemists out there.
5609 2018-05-31 14:28:49 Trump is working on behalf of Russian needs! Russia needs and wants to Destabilize NATO, Russia need to increase the price of oil, Russia need Trump in Office just long enough to continue their agenda! Outcome!? Trump and Family get's paid
5610 2018-05-31 14:28:40 beware the "Right to Try" Bill, signed with blonde moppet hug on the side.  It opens the doors for Con-men, Grifters, and other Snake Oil salesman to prey on the desperate- now protected by our White House and Government.

5619 2018-05-31 14:28:08 So tariffs on Canadian Steel and Alluminum Trump. Fine, 300% export tax on every barrel of oil we send you #cdnpoli #tariffs
5620 2018-05-31 14:28:07 Tell the good Counsel. All the money collected goes direct to China. Hata shillingi hatupati. Until like another so many years. Unless we manage the oil from Turkana well.

5630 2018-05-31 14:26:55 Building a pipeline won't get us a better price for our high cost heavy oil. Thats the real falsehood. US oil exports can crush us abroad just as easily as in Chicago.

5633 2018-05-31 14:26:39 Today's tariff announcements are another USD bullish event.  Added on top of yuge oil exports and we're talking about a serious contraction of dollars available abroad to fund USD denominated liabilities.

5636 2018-05-31 14:26:29 Just have it checked to make sure that the internal cooler under the radiator isn’t leaking fluid into the transmission oil that runs right under it to cool it. I had the internal cooler bypassed with another external cooler. Haven’t had a problem since. This was 3 years ago.
5637 2018-05-31 14:26:26 With most state debts at peak and i so many projects in the pipeline, all over the nation, a reduced  tax on petrol would cost the government a lot. U think solving the oil problem will happen by magic. Especially with greed and foolishness of Indians at all time high.

5654 2018-05-31 14:25:07 Correct.  And if China acquired real assets (oil, gold, refineries, Ag land, equities) w their USD’s instead of UST’s, who funds the US govt’s (rapidly rising) deficits?

5656 2018-05-31 14:25:04 #US business investment leaps up. Firms certainly feel more confident as a result of Trump’s deregulation and tax cuts. But main driver is high oil prices making capex in that sector much more attractive.

In 2013 big chavista Bertucci he was named as the CEO of a medical services import-export firm based in Miami, Biometrix-Med Equipment Corp. He also has links with the oil industry through firms like Recicpetrol C.A., Minería H6 2.8 and Tecnopetrol C.A.
5710 2018-05-31 14:21:18 How misleading.  Years ago, Aftab worked for a law firm that did work for oil and gas companies.  And you didn't say that the quote came from a Chabot spokesperson in the tweet.  Is this what we're to expect from the GOP?  Misleading statements and non-attributed attacks?
5711 2018-05-31 14:20:57 Why not get out of the Middle East for starters but that will never happen all for oil and poppy
5712 2018-05-31 14:20:53 The BJP govt kept raising petrol and diesel prices. It is estimated that the government earned Rs. 4.5 lakh crores every year since 2014 through excise on oil but kept that money and did not pass on the benefits to the common man.The big question is, “Where did all that money go?

5721 2018-05-31 14:20:00 EU exports far more to the US than vice versa, so they would lose more. Since they also have higher import duties, Trump obviously feels he can win this game of chicken. I think his objectives are to reduce duties on both sides and force EU to buy oil from US instead of Iran

5755 2018-05-31 14:15:31 I think she completely understands what she's been doing. I've heard her use this line for at least a couple years, propagated by oil sands supporters b/c it helps convince some people that we have less of a responsibility than looking at historical totals or per-captia emissions

5758 2018-05-31 14:15:25 Hydrogen power is not a good solution for personal transportation. The energy required to produce hydrogen and ship it reduces the efficiency to about 60%. Oil companies like this solution because it fits their business model of production and sales. 1/2
5759 2018-05-31 14:15:23 The almond oil will help lol
5760 2018-05-31 14:15:09 Because oil prices were deregulated by the BJP govt. In the Cong govt, it was the govt that decided. Now the oil companies decide. The govt has no role in prices. Anything else???
5761 2018-05-31 14:15:09 #SorryDrMMS it's a late realization a  sagacious leader is a better PM than orator. Global depression, inflation, crude oil price did hinder India's economy whilst UPA2 but v were too immature and swayed to charlatans

5763 2018-05-31 14:15:02 Nah, we good, rather use american oil, keeps oil prices lower than opec
5764 2018-05-31 14:15:01 Our cheese could not think that our oil was dying...
5765 2018-05-31 14:14:55 I'm pretty sure me explaining to someone why I support Canadian Oil industry to someone who claims this pipeline will DESTROY THE PLANET is a waste of my time and energy. But I will say if you believe that, you better not be using any fossil fuel products at all.
5766 2018-05-31 14:14:53 when people talk about cars, I literally only hear oil and suspension.

5769 2018-05-31 14:14:40 Fact of the day: there is no better time than NOW for Canada to rethink her "dependency" on USA. 

Despite her huge potentials, Canada is arguably more vulnerable to USA-induced shocks than to oil and housing prices.

5773 2018-05-31 14:14:08 Fine the respond with a double tariff on oil/electricity. Trump and his band of thugs really have to be careful as China/Canada/Mexico could have great trading and leave the US to fend for themselves.

5779 2018-05-31 14:13:36 Well I think we put tariffs on oil and lumber that they rob us on. Keep pissing us off TRUMP and you might not have any friends north or south of you.
5780 2018-05-31 14:13:31 considering that we have way too many people trying to deny the shits for the sake of corporate advancement of oil companies, idk how far we'll go with actual damage control, as much as i don't wanna be pessimistic about this.

5791 2018-05-31 14:12:58 you can add parsley too or instead of rosemary it's great that way too. for sea fish it's best to use olive oil for river/lake I quite like hemp seed oil too, on some pumpkin seed oil fits great too
5792 2018-05-31 14:12:54 Trump tariffs on European automaker, will leave US automaker free reign to keep making antiquated fossil fuel cars, and forcing US consumers to buy them! Supporting the oil producers of the Middle East! There's been an uptick in the advertising of muscle cars, what a sham!

5799 2018-05-31 14:12:19 I think US supplies only 30%, Brazil et al already supplies 70%. Given beans are sold into a world market like oil I believe extra demand for Brazilian beans will increase their price.

Almost as much as Europe & we have 10% of the world's oil, 4% of extraction. But we don't refine much of it (import saudi & usa refined) & send it to USA so u get it cheap.

5829 2018-05-31 14:09:59 The political economy of 'adapt' is always better than 'die', especially for such a wealthy sector. The FT today summed up the issue well: the oil industry are "trying to figure out what can replace the best cash cow in the world."

Canada’s economy ABSOLUTELY relies on CDN oil being sold to world markets.

5837 2018-05-31 14:09:28 This is precisely why China is rolling out the CNY Oil contract – China’s crude deficit won’t matter if they can print CNY for oil.  My guess is this is also why the US is back after Russia and Iran: If they sell oil in CNY, they give China significantly more flexibility.

5849 2018-05-31 14:08:22 Yep, fairly spot on. Smart speakers are largely just a vehicle for service delivery and access to smart assistants.

By 2016, India had imported 209.9 Mn metric tons at an import bill of $ 64 Bn
The savings are roughly 3% of India’s GDP!.

5870 2018-05-31 14:06:43 Pushing coal, oil, and gas isn't innovative or dominant. It's just a hand out to the fossil fuel industry by doubling down on old, dirty, destructive energy. Want to dominate? Build the clean energy future.

5883 2018-05-31 14:05:48 Selling #TransMountain  to Canadian pension plans like CPPIB won't get taxpayers off the hook. If ever done, simply transfers risk of marginal economics and huge environmental liabilities to their pensions. #Morneau had better options to  help flagging oil sands industry.

Trump always gets a buy

6002 2018-05-31 13:55:45 Canada could build 10 pipelines and still be a climate leader. The problem for the left is they've spent years and millions of $$ turning a 36 inch piece of pipe into a symbol of environmental evil. It is the safest way to transport oil.
6003 2018-05-31 13:55:26 Given the slope of the forward curve and short commercial positions I think west Texas producers are well hedged in the near/intermediate term. What is happening to oil is what natural gas has dealt with for decades. Not a lack of reserves, a lack of pipes.

6025 2018-05-31 13:53:20 Over the last year, there has been a marked decrease in investment into East Africa’s oil

6031 2018-05-31 13:52:36 That is typically true, however there are outliers like Alaska that keep that 100% true.  I’ve studied this data for years.  The reality is crime is complicated.  However someone saying “gun control reduces crime” is completely incorrect as most tight states have higher crime.

6046 2018-05-31 13:49:50 Yes it does. You can probably go to dispensary and get some 100% CBD hash oil and it will be fraction of that $750.
6047 2018-05-31 13:49:46 i just started using coconut oil for skin & i am a total convert. the jäsön brand specifically for skin (not for cooking - says on the label) is fantastic! but yes, i often feel dry, although it’s getting better since i’m drinking a LOT of water now due to the adhd med. 
6048 2018-05-31 13:49:38 I don’t need you to replace my wipers I can do it myself. Not spending hundreds on tires when I can get a discount through the towing company. No need to rotate my tires my Daddy does it... give me my free oil change that’s it
6049 2018-05-31 13:49:33 You guys...for the first time I got my oil changed in my car before the recommended mileage on the sticker.

6050 2018-05-31 13:49:33 So nice.. if oil prices are decided by oil companies and Center has no control, then why did BJP leaders protest on oil price raise during congress rule. Is bjp cheating us? Yes Center gives 42%, but it reduced Center aided projects drastically. 42% is just a myth.
6051 2018-05-31 13:49:23 It's also really worth paying attention to units of measure when reading about spills. If they talk in liters you know they are trying to blow it out of proportion. In Oil and gas cubic meters or barrels are most often used, with 1000 liters per cubic meter.
6052 2018-05-31 13:49:20 I have known if several people including two children who were cured from very aggressive forms of cancer by using Rick Simpson Oil, obviously invented by Rick Simpson it is an oil extract of the marijuana plant and cures cancer. Oh yes it does!

6060 2018-05-31 13:48:16 Agreed.  Let’s say it’s $8 billion.   They will need at least 10 times EBITDA valuation to B/E.   Hard pressed to find pure play pipeline company with that valuation. Need higher oil prices.

6419 2018-05-31 13:17:09 @narendramodi @PMOIndia dear sir, modiji, please do something in oil price hike. It is now reflecting all the elections. Defenitely it will badly affect in 2019 parliament election. Oil price hike is the only thing that all the opposition parties can blame against BJP.
6420 2018-05-31 13:17:08 2/2 #PMOIndia more challenges ahead on taming these lot that is still in power and would certainly show withdrawal symptoms under Modi's eagles eye to prevent corruption.
Wonder whether 1 paise reduction of petrol price was error of mistake or intent on part of the oil companies?
6421 2018-05-31 13:17:08 its lube, not oil.

6423 2018-05-31 13:17:05 Brent Crude oil price at 1 May ($75.17) - last day closing ($77.66), percentage change of 3%.

6429 2018-05-31 13:16:24 I don’t understand why our economic planners only took into consideration the $80/barrel high-level mark for crude oil as trigger point for suspending excise taxes while apparently leaving out effects of forex.

6431 2018-05-31 13:16:17 By the way, if Chelsea was a country, it would not be an OPEC Gulf member state rather a minor oil producer who failed to diversify its economy and is now reeling because of successive years of low crude oil prices. A Tchad if you will....
6432 2018-05-31 13:16:02 How much of this was due to disappearing oil prices? The next year would be challenging with increasing oil and an election year looming

6435 2018-05-31 13:15:42 It's not supposed to? Why would you want a high CAD when oil is priced in USD?

6443 2018-05-31 13:15:17 Went to local shop to ask if I could oil my squeaky bicycle chain. Was asked if they could examine the chain, told it didn’t need oiling, asked if I knew how to oil a chain, told how to oil a chain, shown how to oil a chain, chastised for previously overoiling the chain.

6450 2018-05-31 13:14:44 More to the point, not only are US emissions lower, but they are going down faster - Canada is a global pariah.  Al Gore's point is bang on - government investments in expanding our oil and gas emissions is pretty much the exact opposite of combating climate change.

6456 2018-05-31 13:13:55  As you know the Liberals have purchased an oil pipeline for us Canadians and even for Horgan in BC and his bandits. This is a very expensive proposition costing initially $4.5 billion and more costs to come. I think this is absurd as are the Liberals.
6457 2018-05-31 13:13:46 iraq, libia, nicaragua, all greatly successful. instant chaos. makes the oil a lot easier to control.

6464 2018-05-31 13:12:53 Considering international crude oil is around 80 dollars a barrell and a barrell contains to the best of mu knowledge around 160 lts - this means that (at 70 rs to dollar) the price of unrefined crude is 35 rs already. Thereafter cost of refuning and transporting must be added.

6474 2018-05-31 13:12:00 Ok, sticking to economic policy, it's because there's nothing left to sell.  Thatcher had a full larder of public assets, services and utilities to flog off and offset her low taxation policies, it also North Sea oil boomtime.

And therein lies the problem with neoliberalism.
6475 2018-05-31 13:11:56 I believe you are a bit lost on economics. Blue = 64% of nation’s GDP.

6492 2018-05-31 13:10:29 You know they don’t sell it as a food product *after* it’s been used to lubricate an engine, right? Just because it has another use doesn’t means it’s inappropriate as food. I use coconut oil in my hair, and for cooking. It’s fine for both.
6493 2018-05-31 13:10:26 This will all depend on if they sell it or not at least if foreign investors want out oil they would have to use our pipeline ... it’s also a plan whats Sheer’s plan .... that’s right to post have researched memes that don’t tell the whole story

No one to one relation of GDP vis a vis oil prices
6510 2018-05-31 13:08:52 it might!! it's worth a try imo also make sure it's 100% rosehip oil like no extra ingredients (i used one once that had other "beneficial" properties in it and it was soooo not the same)
6511 2018-05-31 13:08:37 Depends on the plant, obviously, but likely combined, more than the ethanol. CO2 is used for carbonated beverages, dry ice, enhanced oil recovery and more.
6512 2018-05-31 13:08:29 Ooh vitamin c serums are for evening skin tone. Rose hip oil is a good moisturizer that also happens to be rich in vitamin A. Hyaluronic acid is moisturizing and is used for anti-aging. AHAs are a group of acids that are used as chemical exfoliants. Hope this helps!

Car that you gotta pay 2k+ for a oil change?
6515 2018-05-31 13:07:57 Canada's economy grew at 1.3% vs expected 1.8% (annualized GDP).
Slow down in real estate investing due to new rules.
Gain in exports mostly due to oil and bitumen.
Poor economic & tax policy enviroment is what hurting Canada, considering record spending.

6560 2018-05-31 13:03:55 $OIL bought calls on CL futures at the 67.50 strike. Average price 1.33 per contract. If oil turns around I expect 70.54. I will start scaling out at 70.30 as I prefer to sell into strength.
6561 2018-05-31 13:03:47 This is how civil war starts, and many of those very people that you think will be behind you, will end up being in front of you, with their guns pointed at you willing to give you what you wish for... dying for an authoritarian cause.

6571 2018-05-31 13:02:33 Solutions - stop Saudi Salafi groups fund fanatic religious centres in Belgium /world over. Unfortunately America for oil interests and Israeli lobby( I love Jews, Israel but not lobbies) is busy hugging the Saudis, while training Jihadi rebels against secular Syria( result IS).
6572 2018-05-31 13:02:24 No. It's a deeply asymmetrical relationship – Cuba siphons our oil wealth and installs totalitarianism.
6573 2018-05-31 13:02:19 If the Liberals had been doing their job Canadians wouldn’t have to worry about selling a pipeline. Also as a reminder, equalization payments that came from Alberta oil has added a “number” of dollars to the Canadian economy.

6575 2018-05-31 13:02:18 I think the gains to Russia from global warming are why they helped elect Trump in the U.S. presidential election-- installing a climate denier that upends global climate treaties is a good long term strategic move for Russia. It keeps their oil & gas flowing short term too.
6576 2018-05-31 13:01:56 My friends, if for some reason (like idk trying to fix your overall shorts that you woke up and found out were broken) you got super glue all over your hands, the hands-down best way to get most (rip not all) of it off is rubbing your hands in olive oil for like 2 minutes twice.

6588 2018-05-31 13:00:18 If our  prices are to low we should start charging a export tax before we ship product south - including steel lumber and oil
6589 2018-05-31 13:00:17 The people concerned with this oil shipment are kind of dodgy on matters money. Simple question is how much our talking off if these 600 barrels are disposed off?...where is the money going?..how much is Tullow invoicing? Let's ask serious questions!

6591 2018-05-31 13:00:11 It is completely a joke of 1 paise cut on petrol price. It is a shame on our Indian govt. How we people survive on too high price on crude oil. The govt should take the right decision by cutting the price of crude oil in India. Too make our economy strong... Thanks!!
6592 2018-05-31 13:00:03 Government should have saved the windfall gains made during the lower oil prices to be used for the adverse days but they didn't and all the options seems pretty closed.

6613 2018-05-31 12:58:08 As a result rupee will get weaker. For reducing the oil price govt is refusing to forgo the tax revenue to pass on some benefits because it will lead to breach of fiscal target for the current budget and poor macro stability will again leads to the flee of FII and investors.
6614 2018-05-31 12:58:06 I won't say you're wrong. However, picking a reason fro recent price action has been a mugs game, IMO. It's going up, because it's going up, it's going down, because it's going down.

- use vegetable oil as fats

6657 2018-05-31 12:54:16 is always good to boost the export so do we export millions of barrel of oil but money gets wasted away. mainly in the middle east proxy war and buying arms and with no result.

Take-away is that DUC completions can push prices down but do not result in Armageddon as many believe. Same applies to oil.

6675 2018-05-31 12:52:30 Largely true but the question is "how low is low?"; things may well dip lower before starting to truly rebound esp. with headwinds like elections, FX, oil price, weak consumer demand blurring the near-term outlook. NGR is a long-term play if you have patient capital; most don't.
6676 2018-05-31 12:52:28 Depends on the ethanol facility, but at a minimum it will be ethanol, CO2 and livestock feed (distillers grains). Some are also producing cellulosic ethanol, renewable diesel, biodiesel, corn oil, etc.
6677 2018-05-31 12:52:24 I went in for a oil change at their auto place and the kid was Sleeping on the counter!

6680 2018-05-31 12:52:07 Economy is finally on right track. It grew by 7.7 % in Jan-March'18. Hope it continues despite rising crude oil and it being an election year. #indianeconomy

6684 2018-05-31 12:51:50 and to put a target date of any kind is delusional, we also are discovering more sources of Fossil fuels, the Alberta Tar sands holds approximately 2 trillion barrels of recoverable oil that we know of!
6685 2018-05-31 12:51:49 Im part time selling frags n pure oud oil.  I can answer

6687 2018-05-31 12:51:42 I will drop some boiled yam and palm oil at the junction.
6688 2018-05-31 12:51:41 Stuck in 19th century? Wind and solar now cost less than fossil fuel plants. 

If red states don’t want to sell to new blue nation...Canada, Mexico can *easily* pick up slack. Boosting their economies a win-win.

6702 2018-05-31 12:49:37 No tax on it to start, less transport costs (how much would it cost you to post a litre of water back to the UK, compared to picking it up in Dubai?) but the main reason is subsidies in oil producing nations.

6714 2018-05-31 12:48:39 Every economist agreed at REC that there would be NO additional revenue recognized from the higher oil price for this fiscal year.
6715 2018-05-31 12:48:23 Trying to screw with the Russians and succeeding in screwing the Russians are two different stories all it takes is for Russia to turn off the gas and oil pipe lines and then Europe will be on their knees

6726 2018-05-31 12:47:22 I guess the priority of that gov't was the radical idea that the natural resources of their country should benefit the people of that country? 
So really, once they nationalized the oil industry, the economic war began, overthrows were attempted by the CIA, etc.

6792 2018-05-31 12:41:06 Fair pt; challenge is that China needs cheap oil, & US needs expensive oil to keep growing shale production.  Cheap oil in CNY & expensive oil in USD hints at a structurally rising CNY v. USD to make such a geo-strategic bargain work, something virtually no one is positioned for.

6828 2018-05-31 12:38:03 Well now I am confused...  When Obama was POTUS and gas was $1/gal more expensive that today, the left's talking point was the POTUS can't control or impact gas prices....  And if I am not wrong, we don't but oil from Iran, how would our relationship with them impact OUR oil?
6829 2018-05-31 12:37:55 LPC is not nationalizing the energy industry, this guarantees it will be built, it will attract a buyer, funding also has been provided b4 for pipelines previously. China has been and wanted to invest more in Canadian oil, would you prfer they own it?
6830 2018-05-31 12:37:49 no one in India cares for all these! Don't allow mockery of Indians by 1paisa reduction on petroleum! Punish d oil companies
6831 2018-05-31 12:37:37 gas prices are getting pretty awful, just glad the oil business isn't getting to block new technology as much anymore. Wonder if we'll ever see any hydro-ion cars.

6838 2018-05-31 12:36:40 Before we "removed" him, Saddam Hussein used to do that very thing with oil markets.  Prices got a little too low, he would kick up some dust - just enough to inject uncertainty and push prices back up, then wait till he needed to do it again.

6844 2018-05-31 12:35:48 It is normal over time, if not used on a regular basis that some oil can settle and separate causing it to leak out. Unless the mixer has lost a fairly large amount of oil (¼ cup or more) this is most likely not a concern.

We are north of Des Moines, Iowa and heading home!
6848 2018-05-31 12:35:24 Where is the bitumen going? I can’t image the Americans not diverting this extremely cheap oil flow to their refineries. The profit margin after processing this oil will be high and they will get top dollar selling us our own product.

6916 2018-05-31 12:29:13 The answer to your question is that, chocolate in its pure form, does not have the added sugars and compounds that “candy bars” do. So chocolate itself is not candy. It’s actually an ingredient/ oil. Upon adding to sugars and other compounds, it can form candy.

6927 2018-05-31 12:27:23 45% of your oil comes from Canada. You do not have energy independence from the middle east without it. And you support these tarriffs on Canadian metal products? And the national security argument doesn't hold water.

6972 2018-05-31 12:22:47 Just replace oil with any liquid: broth, water, sauce, etc. For roasting use longer time, less liquid in low-medium heat, for sautéing shorter time, more liquid, medium heat. Try oven or air fryer as well for different results.

6988 2018-05-31 12:20:59 I thought one takeaway of the whole CA scandal was that their data science claims were mostly snake oil? The "hyper-targeted" profiling they claimed sounded like what any Facebook DSP has been doing for years.

1. Warm up some olive oil (or another oil of your choice). 

2. Flip your head upside down while massaging the oil into your scalp. Do this for 5-10 minutes. 

3. Leave the oil in your scalp for 2 hours.

4. Wash your hair and repeat this method 2-3 times a week.

7091 2018-05-31 12:09:52 I also use MCT oil in my salads along with Apple Cider Vinegar and lime juice (to increade my acetic acid and sodium citrate levels, and also because it tastes great).

7093 2018-05-31 12:09:46 Previously petrol price was kept low by giving subsidy to oil marketing companies for vote bank politics. So no much development works. Now petrol is sold at cost price. So development works carried on.
7094 2018-05-31 12:09:40 Olive oil can be used as a conditioner? 
7095 2018-05-31 12:09:27 You can top it with a salsa verde made of green herbs grated lemon peel ground garlic sherry vinegar and olive oil. For a bit of extra spice blanch jalapeños in boiling water then refresh in iced. All flavour & no heat

7097 2018-05-31 12:08:50 Is that covered in theory test or other nowadays ? Motorcyclists, well experienced ones would know that all too well but not  really car drivers.
Also anywhere where articulated trucks frequent or breakers yards where diesel & oil & coolant leaks would build up.
7098 2018-05-31 12:08:49 Gotta drop off my car to get oil change before I go into work.

7103 2018-05-31 12:08:17 That's right. Barrel price was higher then; lower price means some oil sands projects not happening & thus less production, and less need for capacity, in the offing.
7104 2018-05-31 12:08:09 Nguranginnya adalah di lembabin secara baik, kurangi penggunaan facial wash, tambahin face oil di skincare line kamu.

7105 2018-05-31 12:07:57 I found that MCT (and to a lesser extend coconut oil) gives me a sudden energy boost that lasts roughly 2 hours (slightly less) while saturated fat (butter, coconut oil...) gives me prolonged (but less acute) increased energy.

7108 2018-05-31 12:07:47 Rush Limbaugh is not a legitimate news source. He is a snake oil salesman who spouts nonsensical conspiracies and untruths.

7115 2018-05-31 12:06:45 Oil prices being the political stunt to fool the foolish voters. These peoples can neither sees nor could understand the outstanding performances of government in infrastructural development and economic empowerment

7137 2018-05-31 12:02:26 @esn72 @Chuckieboy it’s an oil company. It’s not going anywhere !
7138 2018-05-31 12:02:15 It’s more about efficiency than control. If sharing formula is equitable and properly defined it shouldn’t be an issue. If oil producing states are guaranteed 50% of proceeds, they won’t care who collects as long as they get their money as and when due.
7139 2018-05-31 12:02:03 The first step is to maximize revenue off one’s natural advantages. Many countries not so blessed & have to spend billions buying oil this vastly lowering their living standards. You advocate more poverty and/or reduced healthcare, larger class sizes and/or reduced gov salaries ?

But try using a half and half since both oils have a different MCT percentages and also different absorption rate.

7146 2018-05-31 12:00:52 Whoever control Malacca Strait, Sunda Strait and Lombok Strait can hold power over China's needs for oil, gas, and goods they need. In time of war Indonesia will develop a plan to blockade all these 3 and forcing China to negotiate

7154 2018-05-31 11:59:49 During congress rule substantial subsidy was given to oil marketing companies. Subsidy was given after taxing the people of India. Result was there was no savings to the people. It was vote bank politics.

7175 2018-05-31 11:55:27 The only thing that seems predictable about the oil price is that the hubris factor is exponentially proportional to whatever trend happened yesterday. #updiddelyup_downdiddelydown
7176 2018-05-31 11:55:22 During UPA rule, not only petrol price increased but also substantial subsidy was also paid to oil marketing companies. It is to be noted that subsidy was also paid by the people of the country. Now no subsidy.

7207 2018-05-31 11:50:02 The inflationary pressure of oil going up along with a carbon tax attached to gas is going to push the BOC into a rate hike eventually. They will have to make a choice: Keep the rates as they are to try to avoid a recession or fight inflation and raise them..

7216 2018-05-31 11:49:00 Is it? Depends on which oil you watch.
Take a look at that crazy Brent. Mirror opposit.
7217 2018-05-31 11:48:58 Respectfully, I think you are giving Trump too much credit. There are already credible articles on the elasticity of demand with U.S. gasoline >$3/gal and concern over transport expenses. SA/Opec cannot afford to drive oil to demand destruction/recession.
7218 2018-05-31 11:48:26 Some fella trying to tell me about spread betting on the price of oil here. Can't be arsed.

7220 2018-05-31 11:48:25 Before I had this car, I drove my dad's car to hell and back! And every trip I needed to buy oil for it . You also had to toggle with the battery pole before every start! Let's not even talk about the automatic transmission that forcibly turned manual!

7223 2018-05-31 11:48:04 I always felt the second oil crisis of 1977-78 was manufactured to f Carter. How much did Iranian revolution really affect the market? If not for our sanction regimes, Iran continued to pump & sell oil

7284 2018-05-31 11:40:56 No, although running veg oil does put extra strain on fuel pump and injectors. That's why people use twin tank set ups with heaters to thin the oil down before it flows through the engine.

7349 2018-05-31 11:33:52 Kuwait has paid for that many times over... basically, the western armies were a mercenary force to protect oil reserves and were paid well for it..

7355 2018-05-31 11:33:17 Its because of US sanctions because they wont give up their oil to america.
7356 2018-05-31 11:33:16 Yes as stated in your comments “if prices of oil rises”. Oil like any other commodity is subject to price movements. Prices can be up or down. Nigeria for now is a mono-economy, so no spread of risks as it’s tied to just one commodity Oil. We need to diversify quickly
7357 2018-05-31 11:33:14 All i could find was oil videos fam I was pissed
7358 2018-05-31 11:33:10 As for the things you mentioned. ABA as I understand it is abuse. Chelation and MMS look like voodoo rubbish. There have always been snake oil charlatans willing to prey on the vulnerable. We have to smoke them out and expose them.

Don't lump John in with that lot, please!
7359 2018-05-31 11:33:06 How African cities plan to meet their targets is a separate question. Many nations are still developing and struggle with electricity in general. Dirty energy sources like oil, gas, coal are often most economically feasible for households

7364 2018-05-31 11:31:44 @thehill Looks like Russia is looking for something historic as well. Russia apparently met with Kim Jong Un yesterday. China it appears is providing NK with ship to ship oil transfers ignoring the sanctions imposed by UN. Russia and China, seems USA has back to wall

7381 2018-05-31 11:29:07 But even with that, TMX & KXL were always going to win approval ahead of EE & that takes us back to whether there's enough projected oil to warrant all 3. People who know the market say no.

7393 2018-05-31 11:27:23 Of course it's the government's fault, especially given how oil hs risen to over $80/b for the first time in 4 years.

LET b c get oil and gas from the USA
7409 2018-05-31 11:24:24 The excise duty on the petroleum products had been hiked by the govt while crude oil were at lower level and govt has not given any benefit to the people but maintained the prices at high. The profit been only taken by the govt, Is there any role of oil companies in this ?
7410 2018-05-31 11:24:11 12 bil loss? So the TMP is suddenly going to be shuttered and stop shipping oil? The terminal will be shut down and everyone laid off? A pipeline that currently generates 328mil a year and 657mil when  completed? $1Bil a year spinoff? *SMH*

7419 2018-05-31 11:23:08 It just tastes more natural/less plasticy. You can get em with a slight layer of oil which is just heaven. Lastly, the literal translation would be "peanutcheese", and who doesnt want a nice spread of nut cheese?

7431 2018-05-31 11:20:45 Historically energy sources, from peat through coal, oil & on to gas, have only ever been additional to each other, not ‘alternatives’ (at an aggregate level). So we need to actively close down the hi-CO2 fossil fuel incumbents as well as develop genuine zero-CO2 alternatives.
7432 2018-05-31 11:20:29 CBD oil is the only thing that has helped my anxiety without having horrible side effects and now they're going to regulate it and it's going to cost more than it already does, I'm sure.  Anything for the government to make a buck.

7436 2018-05-31 11:19:35 Global oil markets have tightened since the start of the #OPEC/non-OPEC cuts and appear to be more in balance, but uncertainty remains the #EIA said. Between January 2017 and April 2018, OECD oil stocks declined by 234 million barrels with the US accounting for half of that drop.

7483 2018-05-31 11:11:35 Can’t read it as the coward has blocked me, however if he’s speaking positively about a company that has UK oil assets, it shows his hypocrisy. This is the man who supports all the swampies trying to destroy the UK Oil industry
7484 2018-05-31 11:11:32 I enjoyed Heroes almost as much as the Adventure games, Lost World was really enjoyable despite what people say, personally in Sonic Mania, the game gets boring once you make it to Oil Ocean, but I really like Lava Reef.

7489 2018-05-31 11:10:33 ... including the enormous pollution of Indian Ocean ...

This is another "look away matter" of our globalised business. While just right now, German EU 'think-tank' Günther Oettinger () bashes single-use plastic goods, tons of contaminated water and oil drained in the ocean.

7491 2018-05-31 11:09:37 most of their economy is oil based, if they weren't distustingly rich because of oil they couldn't afford green energies, they pretty much don't have any industry nor milions of people there employed

7497 2018-05-31 11:08:28 Is Cod Liver Oil a PED?
7498 2018-05-31 11:08:21 No, we're not getting rid of the FDA.  That way lies madness and death.  Agree it won't be as easy as it sounds, and there will be limits, but ironically it is Pharma who doesn't want FDA to go, because the competition from snake oil would be hard to fight with

We are not taking investments from Arab nations??

7529 2018-05-31 11:02:54 This is not the first investment Canada made to the oil industry. Petro Canada, a federal govt start up company started the oil sands production. Then sold by Mulroney.  Like another conservative sold the Arrow. Libs build. Cons destroy.

China/Saudis/partners’ exporting US nonrenewables mean we’ll be dependent on MidEast/China/Russia for oil.

7576 2018-05-31 10:55:00 Same, I haven't had a paracetamol or painkiller in about 10 years, and since I started taking daily CBD Oil doses last year I haven't taken a single antacid either. As soon as I cut down on my tobacco last year too, my colds & flus stopped. #StayNatural #CannabisMedicinal

7602 2018-05-31 10:51:17 I tweeted about this months agoand I'm sure in coming years the crypto will be the main and only currency for Iranian government as oil sales transactions.

7608 2018-05-31 10:49:59 US stock futures are down 0.1% with Asia higher and Europe mixed. Oil is $68 with gold at $1,302. Perhaps this will be uplifting.

7611 2018-05-31 10:49:09 The international price of crude oil is going down , but in   India the prices are going up. The cut down of one paisa price seems that oil companies are beyond the control of Govt. Govt policy changes from case to case as in petroleum  @narendramodi @arunjaitley

7614 2018-05-31 10:49:01 You know it's not a true picture if you don't look at the liabilities too right? Plus don't they have an investment department? Seems quite silly for a sovereign oil company to have such high cash reserves if there's no immediate debts to pay. Sigh, only idiots will support you.
7615 2018-05-31 10:49:00 I saw a picture of bauchi state lawmakers in dubai, chilling at the beach wasting our resources on frivolities because oil money from the south-south is surplus. Bauchi as a state cannot generate enough revenue to handle their internal expenditures as a state. We need to wake up

7618 2018-05-31 10:48:09 Communicate in a way people understand. So you mean you know you are wrong to say that GDP is a sole factor to determine a country's growth? And what is that crude oil thing? Convey properly. And accept defeat if you are proved wrong.

7620 2018-05-31 10:47:57 Yes, and my story mentions that. But a lot of people smarter than me said at the time the main reason was there's not enough oil production to warrant that many pipelines.
7621 2018-05-31 10:47:51 This things of looking at zimbabwe in isolation kills us, Zimbabwe is a microcosm in the  macrocosm scheme.... Generally crude oil prices have increased this will then affect the other manufacturing till the last person who is you on the pump...

7687 2018-05-31 10:36:45 Its not because of lack of charging points but lack of proper policy by GOI regarding electric vehicles which indirectly effects govt revenue from tax on crude oil business. So India's switch to electric vehicles is intentionally delayed @BT_India

7693 2018-05-31 10:35:53 That can be contributed by the higher oil price

7740 2018-05-31 10:29:30 Always amused at this stock  photo being used whenever there's an oil industry story. Rusty old lube oil drums in a scapyard - photo used by a sub editor who presumably thinks that crude oil is shipped in them - an oil industry publication too!
7741 2018-05-31 10:29:18 @AmitShah It is shame even after your public statement in front of media that oil prices will be reduced & some alternative mechanism will take place soon. This was stated by Mr Ravi shankar prasad. May be this is one reason for bye election fail also.

7755 2018-05-31 10:27:18 I think more of pampers, wipes and clothings (gowns, headbands,turbans for babygirls). Babies are not exactly keen on toys at that age. Skin products (oil, cream, soap) can be tricky because some babies are sensitive, except you take note of the products the parents use.

7759 2018-05-31 10:26:29 Scotland can be self-sufficient in:

Renewable Energy
Oil
Foods
Timber
Water
Gas
Livestock

This could start a global social mindset change which could lead to a changed world view in self-sustainablity versus corporate greed.

The world needs an indepndent Scotland and so do we!
7760 2018-05-31 10:26:27 Bec the idiots made a WAR on oil competitors, but you cannot wage WAR on CLIMATE CHANGE or HUNGER. And - their "actions" against a handful of people in Afghanistan led to destroying non-involved Iraq, Syria, millions of dead and refugees. HOW to ACT is kind of part of the issue.
7761 2018-05-31 10:26:25 @AmitShah I feel very sad & even frustrated now being a worker last 51yrs tirelessly  whether in kerala or Delhi. Millions of workers hv hope & feel what u said is implemented. Sorry to say that even after 4 days no action for reducing oil prices  or any alternative mechanism
7762 2018-05-31 10:26:21 Now that BJP is facing the heat, let them (oil cos) show some support again? Why they don't do it?

7765 2018-05-31 10:25:46 When push comes to shove Nigel has shown himself to be weak on issues that really matter, he's a slimy snake oil salesman.
7766 2018-05-31 10:25:42 Yes, that was a great initiative and even after huge increase in tax filing our ministers says anonymous % of tax in oil is used for well being of common public. 

So quest arises,  if only random tax in oil is being used for well being, so what govt is doing with our tax/money?
7767 2018-05-31 10:25:35 Change your name to Linda. Simples.

Although they might start calling you Jenna instead. It is like how Oil of Olay changed their name to Oil of Ulay because everyone pronounced 'Olay' as 'Ulay' only now the public pronounce 'Ulay' as 'Olay'.

Um... yeah.

Not on oil front, but on fronts of development non-performance of Modi government during the last four years has made the electoral ground slippery for it. So the present results are most likely to mirror the 2019-outcome at the husting.

7886 2018-05-31 10:05:58 Up until 2 weeks ago, I lived in the prairies of Canada. The heart of oil, gas, and coal country. Energy change is slow and difficult in a place where half the year is spent in temperatures below zero and most people's living comes from extracting stuff from the earth.

7916 2018-05-31 10:01:32 Sadly, the social media and MM taxes are least of our concerns. You can avoid them by using other channels. We should be concerned about (1) UGX 200 for cooking oil (2) UGX 1.5m on car registration (3) UGX 100 on fuel which cannot be avoided and will hit our budget harder.

8432 2018-05-31 08:32:14 Perhaps we should think of indoor vs outdoor mobile coverage like renewable energy vs oil. Renewables are less commoditised because supply is lower, prices are (sometimes) higher, technology is still evolving. But renewables are still part of the energy commodity market.

8523 2018-05-31 08:16:12 C8 MCT oil. It's like rocket fuel when on keto, but don't take too much at once as you WILL shit yourself.  Or maybe do, then film it. Try it out.

Constant rise in #FuelPrices is another major factor affecting life of Common man.
Common man doesn't realise that prices are being raised by Oil Companies, & not the govt.
Best way to control Fuel prices is to bring Petroleum products under the purview of #GST.

8540 2018-05-31 08:13:19 A funny moment in today's #REDII trilogue: @EU2018BG says it supports double counting for fuels mentioned in Annex IX, part B, meaning cooking oil. Parliament and Commission underline that it would mean doubling the consumption of fries in Europe. Hidden lobbying from #Belgium?
8541 2018-05-31 08:13:15 Add a little coconut oil to your mascara when it starts to get low. This reduces clumping.

You can also use coconut oil as makeup remover.

8544 2018-05-31 08:12:53 Ik wou net iets op mijn snuit smeren uit de smeerselcollectie van mijn vrouw maar ik twijfelde of het nou oil of olaz was.
8545 2018-05-31 08:12:48 I'm thinking with the massive mosque and 5 or so building being built in Ft. McMurray that Saudi money may well soon snap up "firesale" cheap oil sands interest and what's sure to be a cheaply sold off pipeline.
8546 2018-05-31 08:12:45 Malam boleh pakai tapi aku lebih galakkan kau pakai jenis oil. Contoh rose hip seed oil utk brighthen and reduce acne scar. Dia lebih kurang mcm alpha je. Alpha nie dia dah cover semua dah. Cari toner yg ph balance mcm klairs toner. And boleh pakai salicylic acid utk acne

8554 2018-05-31 08:11:54 it’s very moisturizing because it has almond oil in it so i don’t think it’s going to be drying. you could always pick up a sample, that’s what i did.
8555 2018-05-31 08:11:53 Never turn the stovetop above medium heat. This reduces pan warping, makes your oil last farther, and prevents food burning.
8556 2018-05-31 08:11:10 Worse thing, most frustrating was many of those places have oil, gas, coal but world bank, UN wouldn't finance them to install power plants, grids using their resources but forced to use unreliable, expensive solar, wind that just don't work there

8569 2018-05-31 08:09:48 Due to the rise in the price of crude oil in international markets there has been an increase in price of petrol & diesel. However, this has not affected the economy of the country. Our govt is trying to solve it so that public don't suffer: Home Minister Rajnath Singh in Bhopal

8573 2018-05-31 08:08:27 And by the way, you have a cabinet full of lobbyists and special interest, even writing the tax scam bill, oil companies destroying the environment selling out your kids, people losing Healthcare so rich guys can get another tax break and buy back their own stock. U been conned
8574 2018-05-31 08:07:58 Do you know the proverb...just oil your own machine??maybe no if you than you were not gave useless articles
8575 2018-05-31 08:07:48 I think cost of fuel should go up. Oil price has increased from the sub $30 per barrel in 2016 to $75-80 per barrel. And with no currency of our own, we have limited if not no channels to absorb the shock.

8580 2018-05-31 08:06:31 Losses would be great, cost too high and PR nightmare would emerge.
Most important block to USA interests is Syria controling Al-Bukamal so no unauthorised gas/oil pipline can be built through Syrian territory, and Iraq will not allow to pass through theirs, so USA  is at a loss.

8597 2018-05-31 08:03:01 The best answer to any “what currency will you use?” question I’ve heard was: ‘whatever currency you want to buy our oil, energy and food n’ drink will be acceptable!’ 
8598 2018-05-31 08:02:56 BJP not ready to accept that oil prices played key role in its defeat. It will loose in 2019 because it has hit hard middle class who is its core voter but will slip away.

8633 2018-05-31 07:55:54 There is an urgent need for BJP to introspect itself. Doing nothing to check oil prices. They are involved in rhetoric nothing else.

8636 2018-05-31 07:55:08 We should understand this oil Mafia first. Definitely BJP is not going lose becos of the petrol ..forget that . 
Where is greed ? It's for public Good only . If you cut tax on petrol some other has to go up. Truck cos have inbuilt formula for fluctuations in diesel prices
8637 2018-05-31 07:55:06 “no country would find 173bn barrels of oil in the ground and just leave it there”. Ironic! 
So capitalism's plan to go green requires the complete exhaustion of oil and other resources?

8647 2018-05-31 07:51:35 People have started calling the German economy overheated as a result of the 2.2% inflation print yesterday..

So the German economy is overheated, because of a distorted global oil supply? 

I don't really get it. High headline inflation in Germany is not on the ECBs radar.

8764 2018-05-31 07:27:17 Logic would have been to invest revenues in other assets like infrastructure. Parallels with North Sea oil revenues which were also used to fund tax cuts rather than being put into Sovereign Wealth Fund like Norway.

8779 2018-05-31 07:24:37 I think there’s a lot of misinformation being spread under the radar about EVs , and the anti-EV voices are going to get MUCH louder as they start to pinch on the profits of other car manufacturers and big oil ...

8781 2018-05-31 07:24:21 Oil prices. Can't do anything . We have no sway over oil prices.
8782 2018-05-31 07:24:05 its time to introspect for BJP,  make use of 8 months to see that poll strategy of 2019 formed well. Understand why people are negating you. Impact of GST on a low profile businessman and frequent derailment of currency distribution in ATM, Oil prices.
8783 2018-05-31 07:23:47 I was on a job years ago that the NEB shut down because they were not happy with how the consultant was doing things. He was replaced by the oil and gas company. Job restarted, NEB did a follow up inspection,  all was good.
That is certainly not coruption.
8784 2018-05-31 07:23:27 I want a boat so bad and my dad says if you buy it oil will probably crash and you will lose it and your truck and everything you have... true put it in the absolutely worst case scenario

8788 2018-05-31 07:22:41 From memory as not in front of me to read, in return for oil, Europe agree to allow unrestricted immigration from North Africa, allow the culture, customs and religion with no restrictions.  In short, allowing the Nordic race and culture to be diluted and there is nowt we can do.
8789 2018-05-31 07:22:36 A drop of olive oil rubbed nightly into your nails will help them grow long and strong, and is cheaper than shop-bought manicure oils.

8830 2018-05-31 07:16:25 You somewhat have a point. I had to change the transmission on my 05 xterra. Apparently it’s some sort of factory defect mostly on trucks and SUVs from years 05-07. Transmission coolant fluid leaks into the transmission oil causing the transmission to go bad.

8928 2018-05-31 07:02:29 Correct. In fact, the medications eligible for the Right to Try law must have already passed Phase I trials. Phase I trials are done on humans (small number of participants) to study safety, efficacy, and dosing.  So, these are not just some concoction done by snake oil salesmen.
8929 2018-05-31 07:02:25 Does that include CBD Oil and Stem Cells at a sliding fee scale based on 10% of the highest income earned if they do not have insurance? How about signing a bill that forces insurance companies to cover these treatments for a period of 1 year or longer with regular testing?

8948 2018-05-31 06:59:39 I was stunned when he thought it was so healthy he couldn't operate. Clearly evening primrose oil isn't going to affect someone so severely like that - it's horribly negligent to dismiss symptoms that way. I'm relieved I was diagnosed when I was; just wish we had a cure too!

8981 2018-05-31 06:54:48 But when there was a drop in price of crude oil did you give any benefits? From 120$ to 27$ a barrel, what benefit did people get? Today it is 80$ yet higher than 2013 prices of fuel

8994 2018-05-31 06:52:57 Trigger for oil price increase was NOT the US-Iran deal cancellation BUT Russia-OPEC deal in Vienna in December-17. So Russia ATLEAST as responsible as US for oil price hike

9069 2018-05-31 06:38:32 Realllll. My number one tip for getting excited about homemade skincare stuff rather than the pretty, well lot store bought stuff is to splurge on some pretty jars to put stuff in and at least one essential oil to make things smell nice.
9070 2018-05-31 06:38:28 For soup, cook sliced onion in oil, then simmer with seitan, miso paste, chicken broth and tomatoes. Top with sour cream.

9085 2018-05-31 06:35:14 Simply knowing is no use, neither promoting Horlicks/Bournvita or similar high priced drinks. I know in my childhood oil extraction was localised with fresh oil cakes (groundnut/gingily) were relished by us with jaggery. No children know this.

9130 2018-05-31 06:25:33 Why didn't you just put your 'oil money' towards local refineries? Now we have to pay for the old pipeline, and ship the bitumen across sea for Asia to refine it and make profit off your terrible Alberta bitumen. LOL Now you screwed up!
9131 2018-05-31 06:25:24 You jokers made a mockery of your self with oil prices reduction by 7 pausey and 5 paise. Country is laughing at your actions. This is what happens, if idiots are given power.

9183 2018-05-31 06:14:59 Governments do not need to operate or own what does not concern their primary function.  Experience of Petro Canada was bad deal for Canadians. High oil prices (70s) was a driver of its  creation. Seems KM buyout course will be the same.
9184 2018-05-31 06:14:50 Pierre Trudeau’s legacy is being hated by the Right for limiting oil companies profits. Justin Trudeau’s will be being hated by the left for prioritizing big oil over everything else. #cdnpoli #TransMountainPipeline

9298 2018-05-31 05:57:18 While you are at it legalize all derivatives like hemp oil/ cbd oil.... Eg. Ignorant lic. & Reg. (LARA) in mich says if falls under medical cannabis while virtually no psychoative ingredients. GOP NEEDS TO GET A GRIP
9299 2018-05-31 05:57:15 I agree. The government should step in immediately to support the energy industry. But having read Trudeau's comments in MacLean's magazine, he and his staff know zero about the oil and gas sector.

9310 2018-05-31 05:56:16 #Refined soya oil prices drifted lower by 0.46 per cent to Rs 762.70 per 10 kg in futures market today as speculators cut their bets amid easing demand in the spot market against ample stocks position.

9315 2018-05-31 05:56:01 Fact is clear..govt doesn't have spare resources .. they need the tax money desperately to meet targets. Tough times for the centre. If anything some states may have a better year as higher GST revenues and oil taxes kick in.
9316 2018-05-31 05:55:35 God damn snake oil salesmen
9317 2018-05-31 05:55:35 In crude oil theres no signal bullish/bearish in the system for now?
9318 2018-05-31 05:55:31 Keep up the Fantastic work. Why don’t WE (BC’ers) Buy the Pipeline since the Feds want to sell it!! Then build our own refineries (with All BC workers)on the Alberta border, hire All BC workers and only transport non bitumen. All this while we wean off oil over next fifty years.

9320 2018-05-31 05:55:22 Put it in the pan in the same order as @jettila suggested.  Also, two tips: use an oil that can withstand the heat (no evoo please). A good oil is one such as peanut or soybean. Also, check pan and heat source.
9321 2018-05-31 05:55:18 @sardesairajdeep Narendra Modi is meeting aspiration of people by reducing the oil price by 1 paisa (clerical error). Ye ONGC patra kuch bhi bolega.

9327 2018-05-31 05:54:53 @NaturesUltra CBD oil is the best. Check out using CBD oil as all natural pain reliever. It might help but worth looking into if you haven't already.
9328 2018-05-31 05:54:36 I heard coconut oil works

9340 2018-05-31 05:51:12 China is a big consumer of oil, but they also produce a good chunk ~3 mb/d. India is in a more difficult state as they produce less than 1 mb/d. Definitely going to be a big importer, and they cant continue to increase subsidies.

9346 2018-05-31 05:50:13 Growth rate slashed from 7.5 to 7.3, not alarming I suppose. Without doubt if oil keeps rising we will suffer....but hey we didn't need Moody's to tell us that, we knew it !

9349 2018-05-31 05:49:14 Zero THC Cbd oil is another good anti-inflammatory. I use @NaturesUltra CBD oil and it's been a game changer for me as of late. I mix it into most of my meals plus take it straight. Super easy to use and has other healthy benefits. Have you looked into cbd oil?

9373 2018-05-31 05:43:22 Just had a fun moment in radio where I got to pick between Taylor Swift, The Lumineers, and a commercial.... Did you know Auto one is having a sale on STP oil in LA? They've got a new reward program too! Better act fast!
9374 2018-05-31 05:43:22 obviously, but whenever i date once i'd deliberately go with a lot of oil in hair...just to see how he reacts 
9375 2018-05-31 05:43:20 I have hated cinnamon flavored anything since my mom was making some broken glass candy once (it’s like a hard clear candy that you put in a cookie sheet and hit it to break it) and she added some cinnamon oil for flavor. Pan was too hot. Whole house went up in cinnamon smoke.

9382 2018-05-31 05:41:51 And the Trump & the Republicans pulled us out of the Paris Climate agreement. They work for big oil and coal so they fight against wind & solar.  China will kick our butts when we could have been THE clean energy superpower like Obama and Hillary were planning.
9383 2018-05-31 05:41:50 AGREED! Castor oil is fucking amazing!!!! It stimulates Hair growth. try on your hair & eyelashes & brows. Also since it has antibacterial properties u can do an oil cleanse on your face (haven’t tried that yet but I’m trynna switch to all natural cleansers so I’m gonna try it)
9384 2018-05-31 05:41:48 They also produce a lot of their own oil so not as dependant on imports.
9385 2018-05-31 05:41:33 Takeaway from q4 results: Commodity prices are hitting small caps bad. Pharma to chemicals. Current Nifty 50 and small cap spread, may be here to stay. Silver lining: oil prices will likely cool
9386 2018-05-31 05:41:30 Something you may want to try that you can order online and receive in any state is CBD oil.  That may help him out.  I buy mine from a site named Pure Kana.  It's not a "get stoned" oil but is supposed to be a good aid for sleep, anxiety, joint pain.

9390 2018-05-31 05:40:59 It's like it's too simple for people to believe. Season it generously, and if they can get the oil hot enough without burning it and avoid pulling out the chicken too soon, they are golden.

9405 2018-05-31 05:39:30 So sorry for that David, what do you do? It makes one want to become an outlaw for the right reasons. When I say that I mean avoid the pharmacy & you know. The CBD oil is touted, but is it legal in your state. I'm sick of people suffering because of arrogant politicians.

9415 2018-05-31 05:37:47 Oh no. I'm staunchly for no oil in the water to boil pasta. Otherwise the sauce will never stick to the pasta. Just a ton of water and lots of salt
9416 2018-05-31 05:37:44 KM website says $73.5B increased revenue for oil sands producers over 20 yrs if built - so that's just $3.6 per year. And KM says $46B payments to govts over 20 years - so $2.3B per year. I'm guessing they picked the high range of probabilities.

9436 2018-05-31 05:34:40 What does 'costing Canada' mean? Revenues from export of oil? So revenues to oil companies? Foreign ownership was 2/3rds of oil sands assets at market peak, gone down since then but presumably would go up again with a market rebound?

9439 2018-05-31 05:33:32 I got a GDPR privacy policy update email from a place I got an oil change at 10+ years ago.
9440 2018-05-31 05:33:26 I know this sounds really adult-y but today my insurance dropped $40/month, I received my $100 deposit back from my credit card, & I remembered I have a free oil change when I get to Hermiston. I’ve never been so happy.
9441 2018-05-31 05:33:24 Just because of oil in #BiafraLand that British lied to the @UN @UNHumanRights block the access window for the #Biafran to present her case. 
What goes up must come down. We are #Biafrans #IPOB and we must keep this fire burning until total #Freedom is achieved. @realDonaldTrump
9442 2018-05-31 05:33:04 I bought some 100% pure Jamaican black castor oil for my hair n eyebrows.. let’s see if it works magic 
9443 2018-05-31 05:32:57 The coconut oil is liquid #dlws
9444 2018-05-31 05:32:51 Is it ok to use coconut oil and coconut products if high cholesterol is a problem. I can’t take statins and want to change it through diet. Worried about how much coconut oil etc is used in the clever guts recipes. @justasking
9445 2018-05-31 05:32:42 "Ah! They want $10 for this oil painting? I can't accept this! Why not just pay how much I think it is? Why would I do that when I can just not pay at all!"
9446 2018-05-31 05:32:36 Yeah, as someone whose tribe was a part of Biafra. The Biafra plan did not benefit the smaller tribes in that nation bc it never tackled tribalism and they only wanted Ogoniland bc we had oil and that gave them an economic edge against Nigeria.
9447 2018-05-31 05:32:30 Trade deficit is a normal thing for a country that imports most of its goods. Oil prices are going up, Nigeria will have no problem servicing the debts, if oil prices continue to rise, besides most of those loans are not even necessary.

9449 2018-05-31 05:32:04 I came out the shower oiled up, I felt like my skin was dry so I rubbed some oil on it.. no biggy  so, I’m standing in the mirror putting my deodorant on and stuff &’ Chad speaks up and say “Why your butt cheeks shining?”  I hate him!!
9450 2018-05-31 05:32:02 You may want to look where growth in oil demand is coming from... China, India, you know where all the people are.
9451 2018-05-31 05:31:57 I mix a little @BurtsBees dry shampoo and lavender oil and give my pup a dry bath. Makes her so soft and cuddly.
9452 2018-05-31 05:31:48 It's fine, it's pretty normal actually. It's bc no matter how much water you take that won't help if the cause is stress or hormonal problems (in this case ask a doctor) and don't worry, you'll figure it out. What helped me the most was neutrogena's clear soap and tea tree oil
9453 2018-05-31 05:31:24 but would u go on a date with oil in hair? in olden times women used to tie their hair in stylish patterns after putting oil so that it looks neat, but that fashion is gone, there's those gelled looks but not oiled 
9454 2018-05-31 05:31:20 I have been bullish on oil, but trading the bumps has been tricky. Starting to think the Saudi’s and Russians may unwind the full production cut (not that they reduced exports anyway). Just a thought, but could create some interesting opportunities. #OOTT
9455 2018-05-31 05:31:19 i hope i'm not allergic to castor oil
9456 2018-05-31 05:31:18 Whether GEJ OR PMB. It was built with Nigeria's crude oil proceeds. Nigerians free yourselves from tribal hate and sentiments!!!

9461 2018-05-31 05:29:50 I put lavender oil on my eyelashes in a desperate attempt to expedite the growth process (see: Pinterest for more lies similar to this one) long story short: both of my eyeballs are on fire and Warner won’t stop sneezing from the smell. Stay tuned for more life hacks

9464 2018-05-31 05:29:42 Who are we leading?  The rest of the world that will consume an increase of 20 mm/b/d of oil by 2040?  The Chinese that have 700 coal fired gen stations planned?  India, Russia, Germany or Australia?
9465 2018-05-31 05:29:27 Cocoa butter. Shea butter. Coconut oil won't help if your skin is REALLY dry! Palmer's pure cocoa butter, in the tub. I swear by it (and it smells like chocolate!)
9466 2018-05-31 05:29:23 True authenticity is a hard thing to come by. I may not care for the self esteem movement in the field of psychology and social zeitgeist that Rogers was arguably at the core of, but I'd never take it out on the man himself. His purity and warmth as an educator define him.
9467 2018-05-31 05:29:16 When ya make pancakes you add lil extra oil on the sides to make em crispy... it's the only way 
9468 2018-05-31 05:28:57 @lildarkskinjawn i use organic honey and cinnamon. Then use coconut oil and sometimes mix tea tree oil in with it.
9469 2018-05-31 05:28:56 excuse me but WHY do we need to ADD OIL are we making instant noodles or are we doing gourmet cookery just fucken put *everything* in the goddamn seasoning i don't have all day #DesignFail

9476 2018-05-31 05:28:13 Well not exactly who he said he was; he never hyped himself, that all came later through the cultural zeitgeist. He just went about his business trying to teach and trying to help where he could.

9483 2018-05-31 05:27:00 "largest economy" does not mean best. It simply means an economy where the consumers and market is "plenty"

Nigeria has the largest economy because of its population but it's far from the best. You get now?

I wonder why people make this common mistake.

9490 2018-05-31 05:26:18 Yesssss. I got an old hand-crank pasta machine, making pasta with it is just... the easiest and most /fun/ and the best and tastiest thing /ever/. That's a cup an and a half of flour, pinch of salt, two eggs, and because I've never done it before a tablespoon of sesame oil. Best!
9491 2018-05-31 05:26:10 I think part of the reason that Mr. Rogers has been as beloved within our generation as he has is because he for all intents and purposes was exactly who he said he was. Growing up how we have and now in the age of twitter, there are precious few public figures we can say about.
9492 2018-05-31 05:26:04 So you're going to stop all oil shipments through BC? Would you like to live without heat or electricity? Because maybe then you would actually have to get off the internet and read a book.

9516 2018-05-31 05:22:02 The mess (anti-pipeline sentiment) was nurtured by the industry (oil/gas, pipeline) and the Harper government that referred to anyone with objections as eco-tourists. Neil Camarta (formerly of Shell and Suncor) noted that the industry paid no attention to its public image.

9519 2018-05-31 05:21:38 BJP for its survival should concentrate on more reservations, minority appeasement, subsidies and many more freebies.
Also on reducing oil prices, more banking eases, more tax benefits etc.,
Final message : continue congress behavior with more drums
9520 2018-05-31 05:21:08 It still baffles me that so many physicians are fine prescribing Oxycodone, but it’s an absolute no no when they find out someone smokes weed for their pain or even just takes CBD oil... like????
9521 2018-05-31 05:21:05 The ability to perfect carbon capture is progressing.  It should be more effective with natural gas than with coal or oil initially, but this is fantastic news for people that want to reduce global warming.

9528 2018-05-31 05:20:18 The government spent $4.5 billion of public funds for a Texas Oil Company yet the Semiahmoo First Nation Reserve in White Rock does not have a supply of fresh water to drink.

9550 2018-05-31 05:16:48 Sorry to hear this. CBD oil has been reported to have great results. It's not too expensive and is available in health stores (at least it is in the UK but our countries aren't so different hopefully). Best wishes.

9579 2018-05-31 05:12:22 Oops, Israelis are screwed, history isn't on their side, only the Scofield bible( Evangelical Bible) and Wahhabis,who want to keep their jobs as kings, of the desert oil kingdoms.
9580 2018-05-31 05:12:12 Ricky come on man.The reason the oil didn’t lose a good player is because they didn’t have many veteran players they needed to protect.They were lucky they had really young players for the draft. Next 1 they won’t be as lucky which is fine hopefully that means more useful vets
9581 2018-05-31 05:12:08 Twitter words are cheap.  I have no doubt you would ignore the call to arms. Leftists think soldiers and cops are disposable cannon fodder, not themselves.

9586 2018-05-31 05:11:32 China’s sweeping claims of sovereignty over the sea—and the sea’s estimated 11 billion barrels of untapped oil and 190 trillion cubic feet of natural gas—have antagonized competing claimants Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam.

9591 2018-05-31 05:10:27 ...but between KM and Trudeau, KM flipped it to a PE firm who flipped it to another oil company and back to the PE firm before back to KM. Sounds like a popular way to jack up the price before it’s sold to the public. Oh sorry, that’s the Vancouver Real estate market.
9592 2018-05-31 05:10:24 I’m sick of people calling her a pornstar I’ve been through all sites trying to see that ass in action yet all I find is her rubbing oil on. She might as well be considered an IG model instead
9593 2018-05-31 05:10:18 油揚げって言うほど油って感じしなくない？ほんとに騙された気分だよ。
9594 2018-05-31 05:10:16 No. They both should. But, as I'm sure you know, tarsands oil is particularly dirty

9598 2018-05-31 05:10:07 Peddlin' that same old snake oil from one rally to the next? Same old spin! Same old tired message! Sneaking suspicion someone else did something similar? What was his name? Adolf something???...that's it Adolf Hitler!!! Next thing we'll see military parades & Donny in a uniform?
9599 2018-05-31 05:09:52 Have you watched oil trains fall in a river?
9600 2018-05-31 05:09:38 Actually, the electoral college worked pretty good. It kept Clinton out of office.

9605 2018-05-31 05:08:37 I wonder if he includes Geophysical research, which is government subsidized, into "the oil industry". Well, they work for the oil industry, but they do Geophysical research, and sometimes only come up with data, and no oil.
9606 2018-05-31 05:08:21 well, I've tried my best to do 50g of carbs or less lately, along with using MCT oil. I should probably incorporate this 30 minutes of walking to help.
9607 2018-05-31 05:08:14 Face oil.
9608 2018-05-31 05:08:12 Fuk yeah that’s all i want so when oil goes down I’m good and it’s starting already

9615 2018-05-31 05:06:38 You can just use a Translucent setting powder. It helps with oil control.
9616 2018-05-31 05:06:14 I always considered ANWR as a strategic reserve for the end of oil days in 50 years. How many years of reserves does the earth have? How many years of reserves does Alaska have.
9617 2018-05-31 05:06:13 @EPA POLYTON nano technology India developed nano additives for fuel emulsion technology. Reduce NOx, co2, so2 70% and save fuel 30% for oil fired industry and power plants. No loss no profit bases so if any interested in so please email. Polyton@gmail.com

    He mused, watching Lyall walk off.

Axel took his half hour break to eat and attempt to clean his hands off, which were stained from the oil and grease.
    That shit was never coming out. . Or anytime soon.
9625 2018-05-31 05:05:38 All the issues I’ve had have been recent and normal stuff. Battery. Starter. Small oil leak. My brakes went out but that was my fault. 

The only odd issues I’ve had were issues with my gas line and an issue with a sensor so my car wouldn’t start, but again, it’s 12 years old.
9626 2018-05-31 05:05:36 (2) publicly endorsed a new AWB.  The outcry from membership was so strong, Adler apologized and had to walk back his endorsement.  He just assumed, b/c FLEOA had previously endorsed it, that membership would support another.  He was mistaken.
9627 2018-05-31 05:05:28 You are such a nut ...Control on  Fuel prices were taken away by your dear friends Congress, today oil cos decides the prices depending upon crude prices. Why don't you cut down the taxes of Delhi Govt on Fuel in Delhi before opening your big mouth
9628 2018-05-31 05:05:22 Yikes. So sorry. Spiders hate peppermint if you want to spray your house without gagging. I use peppermint extract. Some use oil
9629 2018-05-31 05:05:08 actually unsure how much cooking's gonna be a career for me because i remembered tonight that frying stuff and dealing with oil feels really unpleasant for the most part, like the air itself got coated with grease. went for a shower immediately after that burger tonight
9630 2018-05-31 05:05:05 kadiri kaya para ka lang kumakain ng oil 
9631 2018-05-31 05:05:01 Dude, my next vote is literally shithead (wastes funds fighting an oil pipeline that's been approved and faced far more rigorous enviro-assessments than anything in the US) vs. Shithead (punk singer/Green party) for mayor of Burnaby, so that's still better than me.
9632 2018-05-31 05:04:50 Coconut oil is good for the skinnn
9633 2018-05-31 05:04:36 My brother has epilepsy as well, still taking his meds and now CBD oil on top. Has been seizure free for a while now. He convinced me to start taking it to help with migraines
9634 2018-05-31 05:04:33 I need my oil changed. My engine light on 
9635 2018-05-31 05:04:16 Would you feel as honored to die to take away someone’s free speech? 

What about their right to assemble? Or their right to redress grievances?

Or maybe you’re you’re just an internet fascist that only cares about what your tribe tells you want to care about.

9640 2018-05-31 05:03:44 Wait. Which state are you serving?
9641 2018-05-31 05:03:37 Do you not understand how public opinion works? Do you understand that the majority don't want to bail out an oil sands investment banker like you and a Texas-based oil conglomerate? How much do you have invested in the oil sands by the way? Why don't disclose that ever? #cdnpoli
9642 2018-05-31 05:03:35  แบร่
9643 2018-05-31 05:03:31 Kind of propaganda created by Libtards on social media, even a kid can tell the price in international market..... By the way can u tell what's the CU price for today & the month to come..... & How metal prices get affected with change in crude oil price... Take your time 
9644 2018-05-31 05:03:28 I’ll take it a step further and say it’s gross because they use cottonseed oil for the fries. 
9645 2018-05-31 05:03:26 Please try CBD oil w him. Calms the brain so much.

9648 2018-05-31 05:02:26 Let me ask if POTUS signed a bill blocking USA oil production keeping the USA from becoming oil sufficient. Would you support him?
9649 2018-05-31 05:02:23 1. Our debt is serviceable, with GST and the rising oil price. But with the abolishiment of GST, im not sure anymore. Maybe thats why they scrap all the mega projects, because loss of income from GST.
2.  RM 40 millions is a lot when you need to open tabung tin milo.

9659 2018-05-31 05:01:38 (1) "Better chances with Feds" is BS.  When the AWB was debated in the early 90's the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association (FLEOA) endorsed the bill (without consulting their members). After Sandy Hook, Jon Adler, then Pres. of FLEOA (again, w/o consulting membership)...
9660 2018-05-31 05:01:36 My reply is not to defend or justify but only to enlighten. For example, as an engineer I understand why there is an outage because an oil leak needs to be repaired. A transformer is filled with oil to insulate and cool the windings. A leaking trfr must be sealed and refilled
9661 2018-05-31 05:01:35 glow very light on my face  I’m so happy to take care my skin with this moisturizer mascara  good for sensitive skin for combo to oil skin it’s gluten free, preservatives free no artificial colors and fragrance free  it’s amazing

9663 2018-05-31 05:01:31 CORE SPREADS - Asian markets hold on to the Street of Dreams' upbeat mood and grab on to its coattails, with crude oil firmer - ASX +0.47%, Shanghai +1.38%, Hang Seng +0.75%, Nikkei +0.84% at 5.57am - #risk

9666 2018-05-31 05:01:19 Mine is a 2006 and we’ve owned it since then, so it’s finally starting to break on me a bit. I have really high mileage on it, so my oil changes run at about $75 since I get high mileage oil, but other than that, if you keep up with maintenance then they last a long time.
9667 2018-05-31 05:01:17 Arey kahe ki good thing yaar! GST has fucked middle class already. These politicians have nexus with oil corporations and each state puts those taxes for their party funding through our pockets!
9668 2018-05-31 05:01:17 So now ? PPL can distrust BJP? IT not abolished, petrol price ironically record high despite of low crude oil price.
9669 2018-05-31 05:01:14 Watching this con man peddle snake oil on a national scale is mindboggeling. The facts are there in front of you, the court fillings on so much of this is public. You don't get the warrents that have been granted without serious evidence. Or the guilty pleas.
9670 2018-05-31 05:00:52 How can you cook ugali using olive oil,and salt our council of elders should hear and see this

9674 2018-05-31 05:00:12 @JustinTrudeau I admired some of your accomplishments. Support for the refugees. Indigenous past reconciliation. Supporting dirty oil chokes up. Not good at all for environmental advancement! Oh well, best of luck helping to choke us all up with #Kinder #Morgan #Dirty #Oil.
9675 2018-05-31 05:00:05 Nonsense.
9676 2018-05-31 05:00:02 Crude Oil has fallen 5$ and Mr Modi Govt cuts petrol price by 1paise. Is this a joke?? If Bhakts are still going to justify this you are Fools, fucking Fools. #Feku #acchedin

9681 2018-05-31 04:59:02 Lol how hot was your oil?
9682 2018-05-31 04:58:41 Ok wait. That's not hard.. water, salt, oil. Boil it. When its boiled put the pasta. Wait till the pasta absorbs all the water, drain it, & add your things. Literally super easy
9683 2018-05-31 04:58:38 That's What Our Mukeshbhai Said...Data Is New Oil
9684 2018-05-31 04:58:32  as usual, you've gone overboard... I'd raised my brows on selective outrage of the journo. However, good to see that you r aware of crude oil prices & what's goin in international market,BTW,. cerebral ingenuity doesn't require feed from what's been said & shown.
9685 2018-05-31 04:58:28 Google先生的には閉店してないことになってて、行く気まんまんだったので悲しいです( ´•ω•` )
9686 2018-05-31 04:58:15 Given that ~80% of oil emissions come from combustion & that if AB doesn't produce, someone else will, @trevortombe is absolutely correct.

Also, in the grand scheme of climate change, this single pipe = jack f**king squat. CTax, on the other hand...there's your difference maker.

9691 2018-05-31 04:57:37 They still support oil pipelines. They still require employees to harass customers with offers to meet their still way too high sales quotas. They still haven't raised their employees wages and improved their working situation. They are still just as horrible as ever.
9692 2018-05-31 04:57:15  Crude Oil Prices /May 30, 2018/
 Urals $72.29
 Brent $77.50 (+2.72%)
 WTI   $68.21
9693 2018-05-31 04:57:13 So I was using castor oil to thicken my eyebrows for about a month, and then I randomly started getting acne on my chin and I’ve never had acne before really hope I can keep using the oil
9694 2018-05-31 04:57:07 coconut oil!!!! is! my! jam!
9695 2018-05-31 04:56:59 ゆゆゆ
9696 2018-05-31 04:56:50 Let that Hilux sit at the bottom of the lake for a couple months, then dredge it out, set it on fire, drain the oil and replace it with sodium silicate and...

It would still run another 500k miles.

On top of the 450k it already has on the clock.
9697 2018-05-31 04:56:48 Wrong. By popular vote, only the few large population states will control the outcome of the election. Clinton already ignored WI in 2016. It'll be worse under a mob rule vote.

But you may have a point, conservatives always vote against their own well-being. See: Harley Davidson, Carrier, et al.
9707 2018-05-31 04:55:36 — right?” Anthony asked, a boyish grin soon masking his oil covered visage. Flashing his pearly whites wouldn’t get him out of this mess, but he was certainly going to try it. Hopefully Pepper wouldn’t lecture him too hard.
9708 2018-05-31 04:55:30 Crude oil markets rallied again after showing signs of stability over the last couple of sessions. Brent trades at $77.48 against about $ 75 it hit few days back.

The crude oil prices have scaled down to near about US$77 from US$80 . 
Now please reduce the prices of petrol and diesel in domestic market..
#PetrolPrice
9713 2018-05-31 04:54:53 @rssurjewala Upto Feb 2017 the rates of diesel where stable around 55 per litre but after that it's increasing slowly by slowly as increased international oil prices. Interest rates for fund procurement from bank is available at 1.5%cheaper rates then 2014.

9718 2018-05-31 04:54:11 It means your efforts paid off. Change is like turning an oil tanker and you were one of the waves.
9719 2018-05-31 04:53:52 I'm sure you can get FCO from any of the Distributors. Yes to answer your question it dilutes the intensity of the oil. It's called a carrier oil. When we put Blends together of different oils we put the amount of drops of EO's & then use the FCO to distribute it further

9729 2018-05-31 04:52:33 Have two qns. 
1. Who pays to the oil companies for the import? State or Centre?
2. If centre pays and state gets a subsidized petrol/diesel from oil companies, who bears the difference in rates? State or Centre.. ?? 
Centre = Oil Companies as they are the majority stakeholders.
9730 2018-05-31 04:52:30 Current Oil Price volatility is due2 US arm twisting Iran by backing out from the multilateral Nuclear Deal with Iran, unilaterally.This is only making EU resolve stronger to continue with the Nuclear Deal. @PMO may consider a Presser with @dpradhanbjp ji assuaging consumers.

9733 2018-05-31 04:52:05 Thank god for Pepper. She was always there, through thick and thin, to help Tony in any way she could. Even after being deemed CEO of Stark Industries, she practically babysat him. It was comforting to say the very least.

Wincing, Tony applied the oil to parts of his —
9734 2018-05-31 04:52:02 oh no :(((( wasn’t your mum applying oil for you or sth
9735 2018-05-31 04:51:58 Why would they have fossils on an oil rig? I’ve found dinosaur fossils. On the beach at home, little ones in rock. You know how long it takes to become rock? Millions of years.
9736 2018-05-31 04:51:57 Oil cartridges are the new wave. Jus so hard to keep getting em

9752 2018-05-31 04:49:50 Are you saying the point of Obama's record-breaking domestic production targets wasn't to drive the price of oil down to 1) make alt energy investment more financially attractive/viable and 2) drive Putin's economy into the ground?

9764 2018-05-31 04:47:23 I was asking the question why he would have made up a lie in 1892 when oil was not the commodity it is today? He didn’t drive up the price. Oil prices stayed $15-30 a barrel from 1863 to 1975. And why would he say it included dinosaur to drive up price? Given that, as you say,
9765 2018-05-31 04:46:53 And people wonder why we need an alternate route to send our oil to world markets. Duh.
9766 2018-05-31 04:46:52 Did you visit all the oil rigs while you were there ?  Sellout

9768 2018-05-31 04:46:13 Philippine Airlines said it sought approval for fuel surcharge of P51-207 last December. It will have to amend the petition as oil prices have since shot up.
9769 2018-05-31 04:46:05 I still find it insane that two socialist governments are fighting with each other about whether it's a good idea to pump oil through fragile ecosystems between mountains in the cordillera to an inlet that can barely fit an oil tanker.
9770 2018-05-31 04:45:55 she ended up buying this oil from Sephora that ended up growing out her eyelashes nicely and made them longer than before. I think the oil was $60 but it’s worth it esp if you’re going to spend that much on extensions.
9771 2018-05-31 04:45:42 1st compare crude oil price in 2012,13

9773 2018-05-31 04:45:19 it literally means “add oil” which is a Chinese expression for good luck
9774 2018-05-31 04:45:02 How many liters is our Strategic Oil Reserve capacity?
9775 2018-05-31 04:45:02 Stop being sarcastic.  Its annoying.

Mind you, the budget for health and education is cut during the oil price slump. And this year's budget, they increased it.

But yeah, if you think we have a debt problem right now, 40mils for WC will certainly help.

9789 2018-05-31 04:43:55 I think this was a “damned if you did; damned if you didn’t“ scenario for the government.

9793 2018-05-31 04:43:07 @dpradhanbjp sir one question, why Indian state controlled oil companies spend so much on advertising? Petroleum is an essential product and without advert also it will be sold out. Is it not wise to save that money and reduce the price of petroleum products? @PMOIndia

You would apply a little bit of coconut oil or olive oil if you have it. And yes you can get the FCO from any of the oil Distributors. But I think health food stores?

9802 2018-05-31 04:41:42 Don't worry about that. Get your dad some edibles. You can also buy pills in California, probably CO too. They look like Vitamin E tablets.  CBD oil may also help.
9803 2018-05-31 04:41:36 This would be my answer, exactly. My dad is dead but when he was alive we were just oil and water. And my mom and I get along because she is entirely too overindulgent of me.

9819 2018-05-31 04:38:59 If you’re oily, oils can help. But Argan oil isn’t the right one for you. Try hemp.

9828 2018-05-31 04:37:44 Alright, I’ll deeg nteky try that. One question. If I used an oil serum ie: argan oil, do you think it is necessary or does it depend on skin types?

9841 2018-05-31 04:35:13 On vehicle ban govt has achieved on 1. increasing forex outflow, 2. limiting the amount of fuel Uganda will utilize when oil production starts and 3. Reduce the number of the employed in the sectors. Let me hope the gains out weigh the losses.

9854 2018-05-31 04:33:28 And when wages are stagnating & HC premiums are skyrocketing & oil prices are going up due to pulling out of Iran Deal? And factories like Harley Davidson moving from Kansas to Thailand even after #GOPTaxScam?
9855 2018-05-31 04:33:22 So is coconut oil you can purchase in stores FCO or do you have to purchase from the eo companies?  Oh so in tune with reflexology or acupuncture.
9856 2018-05-31 04:33:18 After a one paise cut yesterday #Petrol price was today cut by 7 paise a litre and diesel by 5 paise today - the second reduction in many days on the back of softening international oil prices.
9857 2018-05-31 04:33:12 I've just been informed that Johnny Gargano & Tommaso Ciampa's last match is so dangerous, it will take place on an abandoned oil rig in international waters, filmed entirely by drones and officiated by a United Nations Nuclear Emergency Response Team. #WWENXT

9859 2018-05-31 04:33:01 Although he should be allowed to play even though he uses Cannabis Oil, the rules of the organisation are rules for all.  However like all rules, sometimes they need to change.  I believe it is time to change this rule, as it is outdated with the needs of today's people

9860 2018-05-31 04:32:53 Washington State is not connected to a pipeline network so depends on oil delivered mainly by tanker.
9861 2018-05-31 04:32:53 Surprising how motivated folks are when big oil calls but when it's the least among us? Forget it! Wait you peons! We've got to take care of the bigwigs! Not the PWD. Not the seniors. Not the homeless. Gotta help the lobby groups first. And last. @RachelNotley @LoriSigurdson
9862 2018-05-31 04:32:44 CRUDE OIL was also moving higher a little bit, WTI has returned back to round 68.00 USD per barrel. GOLD is maintaining the 1,300 USD levels ...

9864 2018-05-31 04:32:16 The oil market was relatively stable during the worldwide sanctions against Tehran back then, & will be just fine now. Saudi & the Gulf nations & increased U.S. supply can easily make up the difference.
9865 2018-05-31 04:32:15 I think it is safe to say it is not the religion - and I would argue that western civilization has done much to infect the culture through its lust for oil.
9866 2018-05-31 04:32:12 You dropped all your swabs in their olive oil.

9868 2018-05-31 04:32:03 They’re so obvious.. plus they’re not very hygienic since you can’t get makeup fully off of them since oil will compromise the adhesive. IMO it’s a no.
9869 2018-05-31 04:32:02 Damn.  You supposed to be my health coach.  What happend?  lol.   Maybe its the dressing you add? I like evoo + apple cider vinegar or apple cider vinegar + hemp oil

9879 2018-05-31 04:30:12 Apply coconut oil on the burned area. Rub it in as much as you can and let it sit for a minute or two. Then get a dry rag and wipe the excess off. It will feel nicer than aloe vera, which burns like hell. I'm currently doing this method and my burn turned into a tan.

9897 2018-05-31 04:28:22 Shri Modi did not lower the oil price even when international oil prices & dollar rate were stable because he collected the good funds to feed the huge development initiative which he had promised & fulfilling since he assumed the office !!
9898 2018-05-31 04:28:17 She’s wrong about almost everything. The oil stuff is correct.

9932 2018-05-31 04:22:29 That does not refer to whether households are heated with electricity or natural gas or oil - or the ratio of natural gas generated/or diesel generated power. It just shows where transmission lines go. Heat and power are often unrelated and from entirely different sources.

9944 2018-05-31 04:21:14 Any government would have lowered at once the oil prices despite increase in international oil prices & increase in the dollar rate to save votes at the cost of the nation,Shri Modi will not do it as he believes the cost of the nation is much higher than the cost of the votes !!

9946 2018-05-31 04:20:56 It seems like an easy solution to block transfer payments, selectively stop oil flow to BC, etc. But it isn't easy. Contributing to rhetoric that it is easy doesn't help the case, it only hinders it. I'm not defending the liberals, I'm confused by Conservatives stance

9965 2018-05-31 04:18:20 Which of these two would you consider "well-regulated"?
9966 2018-05-31 04:18:06 @jjhorgan Oil tankers, sail under flags of 3rd world countries so that owners insulate themselves from liability. YVR and the Port are still waiting to be paid for oil spill in Burrard Inlet in 2015. A small spill that spread massively. Nor do pipeline operators have liability.
9967 2018-05-31 04:17:57 You, your Amitshah and Modi are big jokes of this country. Country came to what kind of jokers you guys are when you reduced 1 paise on oil prices yesterday. India has not seen such useless fellows so far in 70 years.
9968 2018-05-31 04:17:41 It likely is costing the energy sector a lot more than $15 billion. Factor in the loss of untold billions in oil sands investments. As well as the cost of an oilfield ceasing to grow because of the bottleneck. Expansion is critical in the oil business.
9969 2018-05-31 04:17:40 Oil price is less than 70 usd per barrel. I'm not supporting INC but it was almost double during their time.

9975 2018-05-31 04:16:49 Do you have those CBD oil drops? Which one do I need?! I know CBD doesn’t have thc so I can just get any of them right??

Fact: You do not have to vape CBD to get amazing therapeutic benefits of CBD from the industrial hemp plant
9976 2018-05-31 04:16:43 Then why didn't they just write that?

9982 2018-05-31 04:16:08 Petrol prices are reducing like we are living in 1800's where value of one paise is lot more than we think. Please someone tell our oil minister that we are living in 2018 where 1 paise doesn't even count, for God sake even in case of round figure we see 5 or above. #PetrolPrice

9984 2018-05-31 04:16:01 Well Mr Seth you are such an intelligent person, prices are being now controlled by oil companies not by govt.. Govt can only reduce the fuel prices by slashing tax on it..
