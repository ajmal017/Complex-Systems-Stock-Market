10 2018-09-24 23:58:31 I've been doing a very slow but gradually accelerating deep dive into consensus mechanisms. It's probably my favorite rabbit hole in crypto. Can be hard to follow since so many critical explanations occur in bitcointalk forums or medium essays or developer chats.  Best resources?

12 2018-09-24 23:57:59 Nicely done! I did something similar in Matlab a while ago against S&P500, and it was indeed surprisingly non-trivial to come up with an algorithm that reliably outperforms in arbitrary time frames.  I did it just for fun though, might actually implement it this time in crypto.
13 2018-09-24 23:57:58 @sami_loyal Hey Forflies!  Just wanted to talk a bit about my current situation and story.  I started crypto in March, did alright, then lost about $8,000 by July out of my $14,000 invesetment.  After a month on binance I made about 1,000 back and then started on bitmex 3wk ago.
