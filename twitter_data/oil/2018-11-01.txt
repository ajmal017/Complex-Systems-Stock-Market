9 2018-11-01 23:58:32 I was thinking more along the lines of energy - renewables are the future and we have a lot of tidal and offshore wind yet to build. Norway doesn't just take tax on declared oil profits; they get all the revenue.

39 2018-11-01 23:56:23 Historically #recessions were preceded by increased oil prices & Fed rates or speculative/debt bubbles. We are facing all of these & sanctioning #Iran may be the straw that breaks the system’s back, making the #GFC2018 look like a boom time. Was this planned?

44 2018-11-01 23:55:59 Every company will be producing cbd oil. Every one.
45 2018-11-01 23:55:57 Will the refineries get crude oil at global market price or a specially worked out price (don't wanna use 'subsidised price') straight from NNPC with a monitoring system to ensure the crude oil for local refining don't end up in the global market for quick profit & profiteering?

49 2018-11-01 23:55:30 I am looking at what I buy to see if it has Palm oil. So many things we don't know about that PPL should learn. Feels like such a long list, but just have to do a little more research!
50 2018-11-01 23:55:24 Italy comes to the party with budget surplus. ECB rates > 0%. US PMI < 40. Oil > $100...... its opposites-day right??

55 2018-11-01 23:53:54 On herb legalization in Canada:  Is it possible that the greatest health benefit is public access to CBD oil?
I'm sure it was conceivable for the average person to find it somewhere but there was no incentive for a black market to exist. 
Is CBD oil the new miracle supplement?

62 2018-11-01 23:53:25 Tht oil will probably benefit the few elite as usual
63 2018-11-01 23:53:24 Considering req cap-ex, highly unlikely. It MUST be remembered, when MSM talks OPEC "spare capacity", much of this (in reality) is potential prod, not shut-in, or off-line production.  This means new rigs. This ain't a low $ option. Adding this prod, to drop oil price? Get real.
64 2018-11-01 23:53:18 Excelente otro aumento de gas OIL gracias por fundir los transporte por carretera.. ustedes lo lograron
65 2018-11-01 23:53:18 I use oil for that...am I the weirdo?
66 2018-11-01 23:53:09 There is no way on God's earth that any government can afford further subsidies. We all wonder how the current subsidy figure is so ruinously high under the Buhari administration given the current oil price. The whole subsidy regime is the biggest scam ever concocted in Nigeria.

Had some homemade ones a while back and THOSE were the truth.
77 2018-11-01 23:52:17 You just gotta be smart about it man. Look for oil leaks, test the brakes, no transmission leaks or slips. You can find some deals just be patient

82 2018-11-01 23:51:39 Clean it up? Did you think it would be less work to stop producing fossil fuels? No. It is more work to not go on with business as usual. We are stuck in a work minimum. To get to the next work minimum over, we have to disband an oil company. Fascism is resistance to more work.
83 2018-11-01 23:51:36 So right now I'm a little scruffy but the mint oil helps softens the hairs, making it feel lovely.

97 2018-11-01 23:49:47 How do you feel about one family spending billions of dollars over 40 years to build a phony libertarian movement that advanced not freedom but their personal interests as oil refinery owners?
98 2018-11-01 23:49:44 I thought it was weird you'd have motor oil next to your baking oil. In the old days they tasted oil to determine the quality you know.
99 2018-11-01 23:49:30 Got paid today, paid my bills, bought some books I needed and got my oil changed. Money is spent so quick. It sucks

108 2018-11-01 23:48:21 There’s an amendment coming up in my state that would ban vaping in public spaces and certain businesses combined with and I’m not kidding regulation on off shore oil drilling.

He’s a Snake Oil Salesman

125 2018-11-01 23:46:36 It's not so much the iran oil it's the financial institutions that will feel the sting of this if the do not follow up. That's my concern here.
126 2018-11-01 23:46:28 You know, as I sent this tweet, I literally said to myself "shoot, I bet Leeanne is gonna stumble across this tweet and ask why I didn't say where it was."

It was from Barb's pizza in Cromwell. They were plump, soft, with a ton of diced garlic and olive oil and cheese.
127 2018-11-01 23:46:28 I know this phenomenon too well! Desperate people once they put their faith into a new political system, they keep hoping for things to change! They fail to realize they just bet on the worst choice! Take a look at #Iran from 1979 to present! And that nation sits on #Oil!
128 2018-11-01 23:46:12 @JTreliving kudos on getting into electric cars. UK. Is ending gas driven vehicles by 2040 due to prediction gasoline will be 5.00 a litre and for environment. Other countries will follow due to greedy oil industry

157 2018-11-01 23:42:26 -chance. This is NOT movement speed for ships. 

Cost: The amount of oil a ship will consume when going into combat. Try to keep everything at a balanced, if not low, cost. Otherwise, you'll be me a month ago and guzzling it nonstop.

Stats done. Now.... Let's talk starter ships.

162 2018-11-01 23:42:12 Does Soylent use chemically synthesized canola oil or cold pressed? The first one contains trans fat, at 6 bottles per day that’s 1,200 mg of Trans Fat.
163 2018-11-01 23:42:08 naw i'm just looking at types of oil and getting weirdly hungry
164 2018-11-01 23:42:03 #AfricanLivesMatter Finding Oil , like finding gold or diamonds could easily transform an economy as happened in the Middle East  or sink political stability as has happened in Libya. It could hasten the privatization of politics by serving & former military folk e.g. Nigeria .
165 2018-11-01 23:42:02 im pissed I checked my oil earlier and told my mom to pick me up a quart bc I need some and now my hood won’t pop bc apparently I gotta be super careful when closing it bc it’s temperamental and something comes loose and doesn’t wanna work anymore when it slams close

169 2018-11-01 23:41:43 And now, Global News tells us the high bill for "the clean-up of the oil sands" is up to us Albertans!  Why wouldn't this be paid by the carbon tax funds ??
170 2018-11-01 23:41:30 Fake news. Fake tan, too. 
BTW Teddy didn't fake bone spurs. 
Oh, and Teddy was a conservationist. That means he created national monuments, didn't lease them out for their oil

180 2018-11-01 23:39:49 o but I know you just got a kitty and some oils are toxic to them, like tea tree oil is I think. DO SOME GOOGLING IF THIS DA ROUTE YOU WANNA TAKE MAMA.

184 2018-11-01 23:39:03 #AfricanLivesMatter Oil changes the nature of politics & political contestation much more than diamonds.  Oil finds create new & complex power alliances . Beyond the revenue oil could bring , it could also potentially create new forms of greed & Political criminality
185 2018-11-01 23:38:50 If we cannot manage our resources we,will never be able to manage our selves and our economy. Gold,Dimonds,platinum,coal,......and now possibly oil and Gas,yet we still begging for hand out's 38 years after independence.All this madness must STOP! forthwith izvezvi!

197 2018-11-01 23:37:17 No es “advertencia”, como si China tuviera poder coercitivo sobre Brasil, d hecho la deuda pública d Brasil es grande y una buena oportunidad d negocio es la exportación de petroleo para Asia, la demanda China de oil aumenta cada vez +, se trata de evitar lo de guerra comercial.
198 2018-11-01 23:37:00 Yaradua was able to reduce fuel price cos as at then. Oil price was low, naira was strong n at same time we had very high FR.even with that there were pockets of fuel scarcity during every yultide then
199 2018-11-01 23:36:38 Not a cat in hell's chance. Venezuela is in the death throes of a disease called socialism. It isn't the first country to be afflicted and it probably won't be the last. This disease reduces countries with huge economic potential (eg oil) to penury within 20 years. No known cure.

205 2018-11-01 23:36:22 To my knowledge, if you have a modern car, you don’t NEED an oil change every 3000 Miles... BUT, be clear the oil light does not tell you when you need an oil change, it tells you when you have a serious problem & should’ve changed the oil 1000s of miles ago

270 2018-11-01 23:28:33 We, brazilians are under a coup since 2016.
The monopoly of Globo, a midia group that gather the main magazines, tv channels, radio stations and newpapers in Brazil had great influence in this coup (as in 1964).
They act in behalf of political interests, And its all about OIL!
271 2018-11-01 23:28:16 The west turns a blind eye to Saudi human rights abuses in favour of oil and arms deals. A country that imprisons and flogs a bloke for writing a blog does not belong in the civilised world.
272 2018-11-01 23:27:57 If I was going to do oil spilling out, I'd do solid rock corners, and have the oil spilling out of a smaller section. That way it doesn't look like the world above is floating on the oil.

(Also oil isn't made from dinosaurs, it's made from tiny sea fossils, but I digress)
273 2018-11-01 23:27:28 Nigeria, its one drama after another, every week one scandal after another. Don't these politicians ever get tired or introspect? It's a matter of time it won't be business as usual forever, oil will dwindle.

277 2018-11-01 23:26:41 But in the long run Iran will work to develop elements within the Houthi movement under tighter Iranian control. So think AAH on the Bab al-Mandeb with ballistic missiles and long-range UAVs that can strike at Riyadh, Abu Dhabi and the Gulf oil infra
278 2018-11-01 23:26:19 On behalf of Northern California, thank you Senator Warren! Jessica Morse will be a great representive for the people and the natural wonder of CA4 not a puppet for Big Timber and Big Oil. @Morse4America!

285 2018-11-01 23:25:03 We, brazilians are under a coup since 2016.
The monopoly of Globo, a midia group that gather the main magazines, tv channels, radio stations and newpapers in Brazil had great influence in this coup (as in 1964).
They act in behalf of political interests, And its all about OIL!
286 2018-11-01 23:24:44 Please post a list of candies and companies not using Palm oil
287 2018-11-01 23:24:32 Nowhere did I correlate; I provided the number for scale, because no one deals in billions and trillions in their day to day life. It provides a sense of the actual size of the environmental clean up costs of the oil sector relative to the total output of our economy.
288 2018-11-01 23:24:24 Will someone with the resources look into this company said to have discovered #oil & #gas in #Zimbabwe 

It looks dodgy; they have a crapy website, founded 7yrs ago, no traceable previous projects or assets, director's previous co seems defunct.. shady.
289 2018-11-01 23:24:03 Migrants will not be going to Palo Alto.
Will be going to metro lower income areas where they will compete for housing with residents there, driving up prices, causing shortages in even worst areas.
Just 1 aspect. Makes you wonder why these ppl support this

294 2018-11-01 23:23:26 Studies were done in the 1950s and Mobil carried out extensive exploration in the 90s,that’s when this oil was discovered,Makandiwa simply googled that info and fed his gullible followers.
295 2018-11-01 23:23:12 @amymariebower Thanks for sharing the interior and exterior oil painting.
296 2018-11-01 23:22:58 My technique was to buy a preseasoned pan, then quickly reseason it after each use.

Get it bone dry and heat over high heat, apply small amount of canola/veg oil, wait until it just barely smokes, wipe clean.

Works for me!
297 2018-11-01 23:22:54  you got a oil for death itself
298 2018-11-01 23:22:45 Naw, the only person deserving to be Dragged is the Fake Person who stole an election and lies like a Grifter selling Snake Oil to TRumpian Rubes. Helicopters, Dogs and men in white coats are in his future and that would be the nicest thing that could happen to him. #resist45

309 2018-11-01 23:20:52 I have my children convinced that a “cream” or “oil” will fix any ailment  I got tired of them asking for bandaids for imaginary mosquito bites so I dab some eucerin on it and they feel magically healed
310 2018-11-01 23:20:48 @realDonaldTrump 
If your voice became 'horse'. on Last Hangar Rally, try hot tea with Coconut OIL, to sooth your throat B 4 the Rally.  Very Soothing. 
I'll do this, myself, ... right now as Grandson gave wet kisses when he was blowing Nose Bubbles!

313 2018-11-01 23:20:37 i’ve been using vitamin E oil, but i ran out a few weeks ago so i haven’t been using it . but i’m gonna try to use it to fade them, it’s helped fade a lot of my acne scarring
314 2018-11-01 23:20:35 I spray my pan with a little oil when I stir fry my kale so it slides into the trash easier
315 2018-11-01 23:20:32 I know tea tree oil “burns” me sometimes but then other times, it’s the only thing that will clear up my eczema

319 2018-11-01 23:20:05 That's why I'm not doing #lunchbreakwriters. I don't have the bandwidth to rally the troops, but I am busy writing lol. Glad to hear you're still burning the midnight (or 9pm, as it were) oil :)

324 2018-11-01 23:19:29 When the guy doing my oil change says “oh yeah, you go to crunch gym right? I’ve seen you working out..” welp 
325 2018-11-01 23:19:21 It’s $200, Howie. That’s less than your monthly balcony oil budget.

331 2018-11-01 23:17:53 I bake them with olive oil, salt & paprika.
332 2018-11-01 23:17:45 They say you need an oil change every 10k miles. I don’t think I’ve driven that much. I’ll be fine
333 2018-11-01 23:17:44 Impressive!!!  Hybrid: burns gas AND oil!!! I should be allowed in the HOV lane!!
334 2018-11-01 23:17:41 100% pure lavender oil fades scars and also helps to get rid of spots. Good for burns & migraines too and all natural 
335 2018-11-01 23:17:35 The guy is clever like a snake oil salesman I’ll give him that, he takes the general consensus of the gaming world, and gives what viewers already know or just want to hear so they feel good, does MINIMAL research of his own, rips gameplay and hides watermarks. He’s bland
336 2018-11-01 23:17:10 I replaced my headlight tonight, oil change next week lol.
337 2018-11-01 23:16:56 Was rushing to get a tire rotation and an oil change. Love it.

343 2018-11-01 23:15:58 worth noting: Stickland has moved in to a *much* larger house since he first took office. guess his work as an “oil industry consultant” has helped him cover those property tax bills that seek to be driving everyone else out of their homes

Imagine them becoming independent from oil

391 2018-11-01 23:10:09 Fact. These people doing this to an innocent animal are fucking bastards. Evil pricks. Seriously, can they not see the pain they are putting this animal through. They have stones for hearts and oil in thier veins. 
I can't believe that China has effectively legalised this abuse.

393 2018-11-01 23:09:53 The problem with Oil is that every time the price is ramped up, the shale oil producers become profitable and turn the taps on and flood the market as well as create demand for EV's. Oil industry is fundamentally f'd. No wonder Saudi tried to flog off Aramco to the masses.
394 2018-11-01 23:09:48 Fuel prices are low to just right. Transportation gets a big boost. Build canals to run pipe. If there is a spill shut off valves and a clean up

405 2018-11-01 23:08:46 WTI Crude Oil is $65.31 today.  Double would be $130.62
Brent Crude Oil is $75.47 today. Double would be $150.94

Math is hard!
406 2018-11-01 23:08:38 They also pay like 70% in combined taxes, which is what funds their government while they save their oil money.
407 2018-11-01 23:08:32 @CNN President Trump is now being soft with china. The only thing he had going for him was strong on China. Now they'll take over U.S. like they took over Canada. Canadas oil sector is chinese owned..among many many other things.
408 2018-11-01 23:08:19 My oil life on 15% too 
409 2018-11-01 23:08:18 Would be nice if it stayed here for U.S. consumers.  I recall hearing that much of our oil is sold to other countries, while we pay more for that coming from the middle east.  When in Abu Dhabi I noticed the fuel was very cheap because they consume their own oil... and not taxes.

418 2018-11-01 23:06:53 It’s the first time since 1973 that the U.S. leads the world in oil production.

I cringe when people are encouraged to seriously entertain claims by charlatans (eg Tories & the ML snake oil peddlers) that “improved efficiency” is the answer to anything though.

487 2018-11-01 22:58:07 Just saw a report on BBC news by Vladimir Hernandez on the poverty in Venezuela. It needs to be highlighted more on Irish news stations. For an oil rich country the poverty is horrendous.

521 2018-11-01 22:54:22 Yes, let's get all of our natural gas and oil out of the ground and sell it overseas. That's the definition of energy independence. 
My idea of energy independence... use everyone else's (countries) oil and natural gas until it's gone. Then we have ours in reserve. We win.

556 2018-11-01 22:50:22 Why is CNN on a FOX channel in Cville? Haven't watched CNN in many years and trying to watch. Cannot stomach the Trump commercials, though. 

Also, thought CNN and Trump are like oil and water?
557 2018-11-01 22:50:20 You don’t like oil, you don’t like mining, you don’t like natural resources. Please explain to me that your device that you’re “freedom fighting” on is almost 75% mined materials, and the computer you use is nearly the same amount. Give me a break.
558 2018-11-01 22:50:15 What are glaring differences between anti-democratic despots like Assad and Hussein and the leadership of #SaudiArabia, in particular #MbS? 

Answer: Oil/money/assets in Western banks and other financial services firms; money in pockets of US/EU investors and govt lobbyists.
559 2018-11-01 22:50:07 You guys will come here and rant your emptiness.  What did the federal government do with their own share of the oil windfall? Any of you ranters should point out one eye catching project executed by Gej administration during the windfall. Just one.

570 2018-11-01 22:48:59 Masud tried to recreate what happened in Yugoslavia so he would have his way creating a mini state without Kirkuk and many other disputed areas so he can dictate his rule and prolong oil smuggling for his sons and grandsons generations. He miscalculated. But he hasn’t given up !
571 2018-11-01 22:48:54 Argan oil dear
572 2018-11-01 22:48:50 Anybody knows who has oil refills? If they even have those out there

575 2018-11-01 22:48:42 Sanctions are not going to work while Russia and China are injecting the money in exchange for oil and gold. As much as the oil production is dwindling, there is still plenty of gold. They are destroying the Venezuelan amazon and no one cares.
576 2018-11-01 22:48:38 Unfortunately more oil by rail means less Ag by rail! It’s more or less a zero sum game! Only winner here is the rail companies!
577 2018-11-01 22:48:32 That shit dont pop. Like it's just a little cheese oil and sauce. 

I mean the cheese is amazing but I want pizza with toppings lol
578 2018-11-01 22:48:27 Thank you for a interesting graph. To finance this huge amount of CCS to take co2 back again- based on each ton co2 produced today, how much will the cost be per barrel of oil ,cola and gass ?

583 2018-11-01 22:47:54 PS:   So does Republican Representative Carlos Curbelo from Florida, the co-chairman of the House Climate Solutions Caucus, is preparing to introduce legislation as soon as Monday that would impose a carbon tax on oil refiners, gas processors and coal miners.

586 2018-11-01 22:47:37 I was in the middle of a bomb ass nap til Lauren’s bitch ass busted up in my room asking for some damn hair oil...LIKE SHE DONT KNOW WHERE EVERYTHING IS! 
587 2018-11-01 22:47:22 Interesting how @GovInslee claims big oil is spending soooooo much $$$$ to defeat this bill, but everytime I open my feed I see this PAID advertisement for the bill. #walkaway #blexit
588 2018-11-01 22:47:10 No. How is Tesla's work anti-capitalist? How about that of all the for-profit solar companies, energy efficiency companies, etc.? What about a shifting or elimination of oil subsidies? You're oversimplifying Peterson. You should know better.

598 2018-11-01 22:45:59 Science and innovation will take care of curbing oil use. We are not quite there yet. The doomsday sayers will be proved wrong again and again. The UN wants wealth redistribution and that’s what the left will do. Appease the corrupt UN.

606 2018-11-01 22:45:00 Norway uses mostly green energi and power... We sell all of our oil basically
607 2018-11-01 22:44:59 Why is there so much poverty if oil reserves are so large.....surely taxes and levies on the oil companies ensures that the resources provide a cash cow for the government?
608 2018-11-01 22:44:41 I don't like much in Europe or uk 

banks 
energy - bp/shell
selected cash rich miners - see industrial metals still enabling huge cash creation like oil companies

614 2018-11-01 22:44:03 (someone gave me a bottle of weed-infused olive oil but i never tried it)
615 2018-11-01 22:44:00 -  @vlad_hernandez_ Heartbreaking report on #bbcnewsten but I really felt the need for some context. You hint that this degree of poverty is new but gave no explanation of how this has come to be, given that in theory Venezuela's oil should make it rich.
616 2018-11-01 22:43:51 The largest oil reserves in the world and yet 89% of the population live in poverty? Sickening. I had no idea until watching the report
617 2018-11-01 22:43:50 You have to wonder just how much $$ the oil companies think this tax is going to cost them if they are willing to spend so much $$ to defeat the initiative. I live in the State of Washington, I drive a lot, and I voted YES on the initiative. I have no problem paying a little more
618 2018-11-01 22:43:33 No it’s called a “Ben Oil Tree”. For got where it’s from but you eat the leaves our crush them to a powder. Also “Horseradish Tree”

621 2018-11-01 22:43:19 Can you ever go for an oil change without them trying to sell you something else? 

The answer is no. No, you cannot.
622 2018-11-01 22:43:10 My hands are sore, covered in oil and developing callouses. My abs and upper arms are on fire. I'm out of breath. I saw people giving me dirty looks, but heck 'em. And screw that asshole who was laying on his horn.

First day as a wheelchair owner. NOTHING easy about it.
623 2018-11-01 22:42:34 @vlad_hernandez_ In your report it mentions nearly 90% in poverty now. Where is the cash from Oil going, are the 10% becoming rich off the back of it ?
624 2018-11-01 22:42:33 I have a Target list that goes back a couple months...I keep finding "creative" uses for other toiletries/coconut oil isn't as universal a dupe as I want it to be.

630 2018-11-01 22:42:08 did I trigger u?!? My bad. He doesn’t deny open borders. Gun control. Socialism & raising taxes on oil which will skyrocket gas prices.
631 2018-11-01 22:42:06 I love this, and such an uplifting meaning behind it.  Did you give the students a template for their part of the flower? They meld so well together. The intense colour of the oil pastels carries life and vibrancy. #RemembranceDay #PoppyDay
632 2018-11-01 22:42:02 And that’s the problem: in the future, we’re still going to be stuck with what is probably the worst contaminated sites when oil companies are long gone (just like what happened with Giant Mine).
633 2018-11-01 22:41:50 Your vehicle has square wheels and no oil.

It may work again.
643 2018-11-01 22:40:59 Where’s the science and trials behind it. Please post this information as I seriously doubt it works better than ibuprofen. Some get relief ingesting turmeric or ginger. Instead try CBD oil which has thousands of users n testimonies. No THC so it’s legal across US.
644 2018-11-01 22:40:58 Funny
645 2018-11-01 22:40:52 Hit them where it hurts. Stop buying oil from them.
646 2018-11-01 22:40:48 But here’s the thing: the world is weaning off oil, slowly sure, but it is. I would be surprised if any oil companies are highly profitable by 2100 or exist. 

But even in 2100, we’ll still be reclaiming oil sites. But there’s won’t be any companies to pay for it.

651 2018-11-01 22:40:07 I picked up an extra strength oil (28 mg/serving) from Charlotte's Web while at the grocery store last night. Between my fibro and arthritis I think CBD alone isn't going to be enough
652 2018-11-01 22:40:06 agree on point about things that already burn stuff. wars happen over oil, countless deaths for money & power. Fork that! stop making petrol powered things & grow some algae to power fuel the old things meantime. what happened to rapeseed petrol? & axe gas #fracking is evil.

662 2018-11-01 22:39:12 @vlad_hernandez_ how the hell has Venezuela become like this?
Is there a minority at the top creaming off the oil money?
663 2018-11-01 22:39:09 See, here’s where your argument uses bad logic.

That argument only exists if you assume oil companies are going to be generating profits effectively indefinitely and therefore have money for reclamation.

678 2018-11-01 22:36:55 “Fish oil” is what he uses to cleanse himself of his sins. He’s letting the world know that he’s about to wild out and spread sinful nature
679 2018-11-01 22:36:46 We should take 25% of their oil for retribution for 9/11 and tell them the era of a thousand cousins controlling a lake of oil is over. We have so much blood on our hands due to ignorant politicians and an indifferent voting public.
680 2018-11-01 22:36:44 Whoever claims to have discovered oil in Muzarabani should be treated the same with those claiming to cure HIV #aporojuzi
681 2018-11-01 22:35:57 I have an idea, let’s stabilise the market let’s announced oil find! You see if we do this they will come running and remove sanctions. If they did and find nothing we lose nothing but gain prospects; gas, more minerals, and more stability to our economy you see

691 2018-11-01 22:35:23 Yep. It is terrible. BUT the non stop (already 20 years (on&off)) attacks from the US to Venezuela is the MAIN reason why the economy is so hurt. The reason? Well, anybody with a working brain knows that Venezuela has the LARGEST OIL RESERVE IN THE WORLD, and the US wants it.
692 2018-11-01 22:35:16 This is Saran Wrap and aluminum foil, some potpourri, a little machine oil..

698 2018-11-01 22:34:48 Hi , I just winged it , sorry for the pun. I placed the hot pepper in the blender with some canola oil , garlic clove, 1/2 onion , paprika, celery seed , thyme , cumin powder and juice from one lemon . The wings turned out great .
699 2018-11-01 22:34:18 No they are the criminals it’s been proved that the oil can cure some  cancer but they have known this for years and will never admit it cause it’s they way to keep the population down we all know this it’s a fact !!!
700 2018-11-01 22:34:11 This is the first administration that will take diversification n infrastructural developments seriously...the Dubai Atiku n conr running to now was built with oi/gas money..what precludes us to use oil money for infrastructure n diversification I stead of stealing the money
701 2018-11-01 22:33:52 Oil plenty for your head...
702 2018-11-01 22:33:39 I’m not sure I’d call this caving. According to many, the sanctions will take 1 million bpd of Iranian oil off the market and depending on how things go with India, could take another 500,000 bpd off the market in coming months. I wouldn’t call it failure quite so soon.

708 2018-11-01 22:32:51 What's Trump actually doing about his good mate Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman?  Or is the President's moral compass simply made out of money, oil and armaments?
709 2018-11-01 22:32:46 Was on ground..so it a very difficult to see the fruits of this radical shift in economics ideology in just 4yrs...I can bet u in 8yrs with ficus under this trajectory, oil will not be a major earner again to govt.
Patience is what we lack Nigeria n majority r greedy n selfish
710 2018-11-01 22:32:46 I always thought it looked odd in the cinema. Looks like it's covered in oil.
711 2018-11-01 22:32:41 Oh my! I am not a gretgood. I only use oils in the body. So, I rub eucalyptus on my Chest behind my neck, same with peppermint. Even is there days you can’t get up just dab some peppermint oil on your hand and rub behind your neck. You feel energized instantly!
712 2018-11-01 22:32:41 this was actually the pose i had in mind to begin with but i thought two crouching characters in a row would get stale, more fool i, anything would have been better than the oil spill of a pose i ended up doing, plus, now they match
713 2018-11-01 22:32:39 No sorry not $100 for a years supply... between $50-160 for a bottle of capsuls, oil, gummies etc..sorry for confusion . My point was they have a much bigger market and they don't need a Dr.s prescription

Saute onion and garlic in Olive oil, add tomato puree or any type of canned tomatoes. Then add pasta water to taste.
721 2018-11-01 22:31:56 if Iran gov is still CIA controlled, they want their Obama/Clinton deals back (trafficking). Is Iran's oil state owned?
722 2018-11-01 22:31:56 How much is this down to the USA? Are USA a trying to get the oil and Venezuela don’t let them so USA cause chaos. USA tried to do the same in Ecuador but Correa didn’t let them.

725 2018-11-01 22:31:49 these oil change tweets are really funny because i got scammed and now my dad gonna do the rest of my oil changes for life ...
726 2018-11-01 22:31:41 Reducing fuel price is not a rocket science, after all Nigeria is destroying illegal refineries in Niger delta on regular basis. Instead of waiting to give Dangote yet another monopoly of refined oil, people should be given subsidized crude oil and allowed to refine and sell.
727 2018-11-01 22:31:37 Some truth to this, but requires a considerable faith in another sector (like oil), that has been decimated by recent growth stock appreciation...bonds. I agree that QT offers a compelling argument for just such a rotation, but recent buying in growth stocks suggests otherwise.
728 2018-11-01 22:31:37 1. We as a people, have more differences than similarities 
2. We have built concrete walls on boarders of religion and tribes. 
3. Many countries have successfully separated 
4. There’s life beyond crude oil 
5. Out of the box point: West Africa was wrongly partitioned
729 2018-11-01 22:31:33 Bolton is nothing but a warmongering PIG. MIC must make it's $$$ by Regime change for  OIL. When will people grow a backbone and protest the disgusting murder of innocents for profit??? Certainly not you.

Also some beard oil
732 2018-11-01 22:31:08 between channels to simulate chicken taste..... the golden list for me is salt white pepper a GOOD BIT of garlic and onion powder just a little bit of soy sauce because the marinade should be mostly dry but it's essential some sesame oil and an oil like grapeseed/olive
733 2018-11-01 22:31:06 I worked hard for your government, I struggled hard for clay, clay, your government. The American people and US values ​​should not allow sanctions on oil to be exempted from the greatest support for terrorism
734 2018-11-01 22:31:04 It looks like oil could bounce...
735 2018-11-01 22:31:03 I stood up for her but then she spun her damn story like "oh it was dust, then no its oil but i didn't see it. " then it said "destiel bitch" and i just-.. no. and she is calling out accts left and right saying they "harrassed" her when it's the accts standing up for her.
736 2018-11-01 22:31:01 The oil and gas discovery is great news but given how those in government have siphoned income from mineral sales into their own pockets in the past I fear that this discovery might not be dealt with any differently than we’ve seen in the past
737 2018-11-01 22:30:45 With an estimated 87% of the population living in poverty and world’s largest oil reserves, Venezuela has to be one of the worst examples of economic mismanagement in modern history!  Economics students must read around this!
738 2018-11-01 22:30:43 @vlad_hernandez_ Because America holds Venezuela to ransom. If we can not have your oil no one can. Bullshit american politics.

743 2018-11-01 22:30:22 Heart breaking report on the BBC on the plight of Venezuelans, most of whom are living in dreadful poverty - appaling when you consider the massive oil wealth in the country #Venezuela
744 2018-11-01 22:30:13 The Tesla Model 3 costs me $3 per 100 miles driven for electricity. I charge it between 10pm and 8am which has the lowest energy cost (I am on a time of use rate). The car has A LOT less maintenance too (no oil changes, engine replaceable/repairs). It’s crazy!
745 2018-11-01 22:30:10 クッソ寒かった()
746 2018-11-01 22:30:03 @BBCNews report desperate people in Venezuela making sure the term "left" is in the first sentence. No mention of US sanctions, or US efforts to destroy their currency to make it come to heel & all once again the US oil companies to rape them. Could find the same scenes in USA
747 2018-11-01 22:30:00 Why is a country with so much oil now in so much trouble?
748 2018-11-01 22:29:57 that's wonderful, I wasn't familiar with the acronym so thank you for saving me the trip to google. I can only imagine the amount of people in a few years that will take cad oil the way people take cod liver oil and fish oil etc. and at under $100 for a years supply that's great
749 2018-11-01 22:29:57 So blown my oil change spot closed... now I need one and everybody talking bout $70 and $80
750 2018-11-01 22:29:49 I’m positive the huge increase in oil tanker movements helps the cause immensely.

THERES NO NEED FOR SOAP tbh in my opinion okay
757 2018-11-01 22:28:54 BBC News managed to get through a 5 minute segment on Venezuela without using the word socialism, which is what reduced a country with massive oil reserves to a place where mothers give their children away because they can't feed them.

768 2018-11-01 22:26:30 My Old Roommate used to cool an angel hair pasta that was meat less. Basically, take as much garlic as you like, start to cook it on the stove with a bit of olive oil, then cut up a bunch of tomatoes and throw them in there with basil, take cheap white wine and fill 1/?

797 2018-11-01 22:22:31 I so wanted the NR to succeed against the evil 2 stroke hordes but not to be. Apparently among it's  many failings was severe lack of oil capacity, along with engine braking better than the brakes etc., etc....

812 2018-11-01 22:21:30 That would destroy the Russian economy. A worldwide economic catastrophe would push oil price to record lows which is almost all of their economy. I’m starting to think they’re as dumb as Trump.
813 2018-11-01 22:21:24 Stress can cause hair loss. Do not brush hair when wet. Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Is it NISIM or NHB? Best shampoo for hair loss. or somewhat related. How can I detect the official website. Easy on the scalp. So versatile.
814 2018-11-01 22:21:23 They should also be taught how to: do laundry, cook basic meals, balance a checking account, the importance of credit, and how to change the oil in your car. Just my two cents.
815 2018-11-01 22:21:23 Matilda put her mother's hair dye into his hair oil. When he put it in his hair it would dye his hair. I think that it was pretty funny because his hair turned dirty blonde. His hair might fall off which would make his hair look really weird.

829 2018-11-01 22:19:32 I still don’t know how Amazon does it. I think I don’t want to. I got a $4k shredder there for the PD for $2k. Oil for the same shredder $3 less a bottle than Sam’s Club.

850 2018-11-01 22:17:30 I haven't. My last purchase was a few years ago, I just had the oil change place do it, and I had them put on the high quality ones. That was a different car.

Now the oil change place wants $59 ugh!

917 2018-11-01 22:09:31 Can understand why BP would take this stance, and has been clever with it, but is it plausible really? Transportation uses 70% of oil, and gasoline is the largest part of that. What cars are doing, buses, trucks and trains can too, and there's most of the 70%

959 2018-11-01 22:03:32 Brent in downtrend, trading from $80 last month to $72 today. Quite dangerous for our government to set an income of oil at $70. What happen if it drops to $50? Or worst $30?
960 2018-11-01 22:03:27 Lol just seems like a pretty important distinction. Like if it cost a barrel of oil to save half expired fish heads it doesn't really make a whole lot of sense to go on about wasting that stank fillet...

965 2018-11-01 22:02:24 All the people bitching about Saudi Arabia and not going there .... where's the outrage about our government working with them...have you checked to be sure you local fuel stations use someone other then Saudi oil to make the gas your driving on....NOPE . Dont be a hypocrite
966 2018-11-01 22:02:22 Crude oil: Ruh oh. Bad news bears. Major chart damage. If LT low a few months ago, then bulls to be frustrated for a few years. If not, then chance for last minute LT low so to speak. But even then, it may plunge to 58.00 versus 63.00 today.
967 2018-11-01 22:02:12 As you know, those with vested interests will attack you ferociously. look at how supposedly well respected doctors lied about Dr Atkins Nutritional Approach to discredit him. P.S. Don’t forget to take cod liver oil, 342 at Tesco  You’ll need to be fit if you take on this fight X
968 2018-11-01 22:02:07 why did the blunt drop on the floor & it was burning so Tamira put oil on it to put it out....

973 2018-11-01 22:01:56 Fucckkk why they had to say oil change 
974 2018-11-01 22:01:47 Some of us have saying this for a decade not only will it cost that much but they don't have a clue how-to clean it up no wonder the intrational players baled out and sold liabilities to Canadian oil companies #ableg @CBCCalgary
975 2018-11-01 22:01:45 Some of these are a stretch, a case of overemphasizing the benefits of veganism. Veganism does nothing about plastic abuse, for instance. As for palm oil, I wish this was true but it seems to me that most vegans are reluctant to say that palm oil isn't vegan.
976 2018-11-01 22:01:37 That’s why Doughty should just come over to Oil country!

Won’t have to ever worry about it again!

984 2018-11-01 22:00:59 There is a lot of supply out there, that's the fact. There are other alternatives now, so until next recession, Oil will stay subdued...
985 2018-11-01 22:00:59 The deception has started. There's no price at the current International Oil Price, with a landing cost of #209/litre, that can sustain the domestic consumption @#90/litre, unless there's a subsidy or we refine by ourself. This is a cheap attempt to get votes.
986 2018-11-01 22:00:53 Oil demand is inelastic. Little impact during high oil prices, recessions, trade wars, ... So no, it won't give a big boost or prop prices up meanigfully in a fundamental way.

after Cuba nationalized American-owned oil refineries w/o compensation.

1065 2018-11-01 21:52:39 Take care and google Rick Simpson oil .... It works!
1066 2018-11-01 21:52:36 The biggest issue being face right now is refining capacity which is essentially topped out. With the low oil prices of years past and increased regulation, time was lost enhancing that capacity. 2-3 years are needed to ramp it up. Till then, production must be sacrificed.
1067 2018-11-01 21:52:23 Invectus is a scam. They don’t have the wherewithal for this project. They plan to farmout to another oil company. Please investigate.
1068 2018-11-01 21:52:06 Cheese requires milk from an animal usually a cow. What they make is something made from solidified vegetable oil, soy protein, yeast and nuts. May actually be quite tasty but not cheese, so why call it cheese, same as vegan ham etc? Motherfucker? Always aggresive.

1073 2018-11-01 21:51:33 Protip: Don't give your floofiest cat all the oil from that can of tuna because he will eat it, smell like tuna oil all night as he sleeps on your pillow, and then well, bad litterbox things will happen and now I have a wet cat.
1074 2018-11-01 21:51:15 I fried that in toasted sesame seed oil with some pepperjack to add a cheese note to it. I had all that on slightly oversized whole wheat bread slices and made a pan fried meat and cheese with a good result
1075 2018-11-01 21:51:10 We hope the discovery of oil in Muzarabani won't mean violence against people who are living nearby and the government must just resettle them before they are killed by looters. All Zimbabweans know the oil won't mean or change anything to the country.
1076 2018-11-01 21:51:05 Seriously! Thanks God. It's Pakistan good luck he is not in opposition otherwise not only IK but Mr. Shaik would be putting lot of oil in this fire. By the way where is he now a days?

1089 2018-11-01 21:50:12 Seriously? Peak Oil references "extraction"; NOT demand. Geez.
Tverberg is alone in the counterintuitive thesis that peak oil won't have higher prices; exception that proves the rule. 
You obviously don't have a rudimentary understanding; & I'm sick of tutoring and spanking you.

1105 2018-11-01 21:48:30 And when oil prices go up they immediately put prices at the 
Bowser up despite the fact they could have full underground tanks, but when it goes down can take days for prices to go down?

1107 2018-11-01 21:48:16 @CKJCryptonews What the oil boom did for the world is what XRP is going to do for financial transactions.

1111 2018-11-01 21:47:20 Deodorant for sure and maybe some body oil
1112 2018-11-01 21:47:07 The U.S. is  in the Syrian region of guess what? Oil...It's one of the primary reasons the U.S. is there & wants to stay there. Guess what Iran has? Oil...see how they can have a single focus. Just like they've been hurting Venezuela. Oil that we seek for Corps. using our kids
1113 2018-11-01 21:46:58 Smh 
1114 2018-11-01 21:46:47 Bro please go and do some research before coming here and be rantling rubbish. When crude oil in the international market drops then oil prices will increase. It's an inverse relationship if u don't know. Nigeria is not the only country that has increased their oil prices!
1115 2018-11-01 21:46:39 Pdp or apc Fit help make them use oil money
1116 2018-11-01 21:46:34 The pharmacist asked me about 12 times if I was allergic to peanuts because a medication contained peanut oil. I get home and it contains soya they not want to mention that!?

1124 2018-11-01 21:45:48 That's Carolyne Alicia Cass. Her dad is an oil guy out of Texas, Mike Cass. Used to be Pres of Royalite Petroleum. Her phone must be ringing off the hook.
1125 2018-11-01 21:45:33 Whew you need that good blessing oil. 
1126 2018-11-01 21:45:25 To* pesky phone.

Must ave done something right after all those years :)
1127 2018-11-01 21:45:00 I've never been to a mosque where the imam preaches hate, jejune and insipid statements , but I don't know why pastors turn their religious stage to political hate spewing platforms, well thank God some of their followers are not gullible.

1131 2018-11-01 21:44:33 I love working in Linux the same way that craftsmen furniture makers spend their days in a woodworking workshop rather than sitting on a comfy sofa.

A Linux console is a coder's equivalent of having saw dust in your hair, and the smells of raw wood & linseed oil.

Gov Abbott went against obama who tried to stop the Texas OIL business.. 

Abbott & Cruz WON against 60 countries that didn’t want America to punish men that raped & killed 2 Texas girls
1133 2018-11-01 21:44:13 I was wondering why you bought that big ass cucumber and a jar of coconut oil
1134 2018-11-01 21:44:13 I was just thinking Eddie.

Well i reckon Ive turned your Heid in tons bit of s Beatle Fan :)

FAB!
1135 2018-11-01 21:44:11 Canada (and the US and UK) could stop selling arms to them and end the war today

but the lives of brown people are cheap, and oil money buys a lot of weapons
1136 2018-11-01 21:44:10 Also, in case anyone was wondering, for Christmas I want a really good essential oil diffuser and a bullymake box subscription. That’s all thanks 
1137 2018-11-01 21:43:56 @gingerbanks1 what's a great product that serves as an oil and doesn't taste bad? Looking to have some slippery fun.
1138 2018-11-01 21:43:55 someone please tell me why my mom left to get an oil change and came back with a new car 
1139 2018-11-01 21:43:44 i wanna learn how to change my cars oil
1140 2018-11-01 21:43:40 The Witcher:
It was a crispy day in Kaer Morhen. Vesemir was teaching new recruits about  Ulfhedinns. 'Use  Cursed Oil against them', he said, 'It'll make your jobs easier'.
1141 2018-11-01 21:43:37 The US gets only 8.1% of its oil from Saudi Arabia, and 3.9% from the rest of the Gulf countries.  19.6% comes from Latin America, from Mexico to Venezuela.  The vast majority comes from the US itself and Canada.  #FactsAreNeat
1142 2018-11-01 21:43:32 They still think Al Gore's climate predictions will happen.  Suckers for snake oil salesmen.  Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.
1143 2018-11-01 21:43:15 That's a good news for our country but that oil and gas should move out of the country as finished products inoder to have more forex.
1144 2018-11-01 21:43:14 Enjoying your $600 oil changes?

1145 2018-11-01 21:43:13 Not an ounce of oil left in the chip pan, yup every last drop spread across my kitchen floor, good one ash  #getmetobed

1147 2018-11-01 21:42:58 Corporate America is very left leaning. Small business tends to be for GOP. More importantly, you think people are looking to big oil for political opinions?
1148 2018-11-01 21:42:53 Hope you surprised them by lowering a portcullis at the end and dousing them with hot oil.

1153 2018-11-01 21:42:10 I've been following Nolan Patrick since he played vs. Oil Kings in 2014 playoffs, age 15½. Picked him 1st round in my keeper league last year, & "kept" him this year. 
I see absolutely nothing in that video not to like   Getting the better of Kesler is like a rite of passage
1154 2018-11-01 21:42:09 We mine diamonds and platinum but our economy doesnot reflect that wealth should we really be excited about oil? Is this our exit from poverty ticket?
1155 2018-11-01 21:41:52 Too many dense people on Twitter. So with the oil boom and all they still couldn't finish up? Can you list the projects GEJ started and completed in his 5yrs?
1156 2018-11-01 21:41:47 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.
1157 2018-11-01 21:41:46 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

1160 2018-11-01 21:41:13 One refinery uses Saudi oil, the Irving one.    At around only 80k barrels per day, where as Canada gulps 2 million per day.   

Oh, and eastern refineries can't process heavy oil such as bitumen.

Plus, all the revenue goes to the American-owned oil companies.
1161 2018-11-01 21:41:06 Probios, dietary changes and stress reduction IMO can only temporarily provide relief for a condition brought about earlier in life primarily from a major stress episode. Damage has been made and IMO CBD oil will need to be part of the 1st line choices.
1162 2018-11-01 21:41:01 You can only break big oil by building more refining. The same market controls our meat prices or any commodity

1171 2018-11-01 21:40:02 It be like that sometimes. Key is to not hit it consecutively in a short span. Cause the oil to burn quick. After every hit give a sec to cool down so it saves
1172 2018-11-01 21:40:02 Not only is my girlfriend visting me but she's coming bearing surprise gifts.... I MEAN 

So I'm making a special batch of my favorite chili oil for them.

1175 2018-11-01 21:39:38 Shouldn't prices be falling given that Crude oil has dropped from $75 to $63 in the last few weeks? The prices I see at the pumps are the same! They should be lower. When oil prices peaked we were paying the same price at the pumps ten years ago at $150 a barrel. #ripoffbritain

1179 2018-11-01 21:39:26 Why is oil a problem. Europe and America depends on the oil. So oil money sweet money
1180 2018-11-01 21:38:58 Isn't very good as a painkiller?
Before my mothers passing from lung cancer, modern medicine couldn't even scratch the surface, in constant pain, no sleep & no appetite.
Yet 1gm of oil took effect within 20 mins, she slept pain free for 5hrs & awoke, pain free, asking for food.
1181 2018-11-01 21:38:50 Free oil change and car wash at work. I’m a happy girl rn. 
1182 2018-11-01 21:38:37 No lashes. Brows are everything. They both are but I need my brows. You can grow ya lashes out using Castro oil.
1183 2018-11-01 21:38:30 More and more oil. An edit option would be nice.
1184 2018-11-01 21:38:29 Being optimistic is different from announcing your moves, optimism works with strategy. Your strategies should be a clandestine.
1185 2018-11-01 21:38:27 So even with the oil boom they had to get a loan for such project and couldn't finish it? Chai.
1186 2018-11-01 21:38:26 Doing "normal"  car things. Driving. Going to the DMV. Getting an oil change and  car wash.... It's all soooo weird!
1187 2018-11-01 21:38:20 CBD oil............
1188 2018-11-01 21:38:10 don’t claim you a “real nigga” or “OG” if you running around w rats!!! Oil and water don’t mix udiggg 
1189 2018-11-01 21:38:03 Its nearly over 5hrs since ED announced this... I wonder how many litres are left kuma oil deposits.
1190 2018-11-01 21:37:32 So my mother commissioned an oil painting of herself; the portrait is quite charming. But she’s planning on keeping it hidden until her 50th birthday, a bit more than a year from now... Y tho x.x

1195 2018-11-01 21:37:15 I feel like I adulted pretty good today.. applied for a new job position, got my new glasses, got my new phone, got my oil changed and I’m gonna make a homemade meal when I get home
1196 2018-11-01 21:37:12 Ironically the well-photoshopped picture here doesn’t refer to old oil wells or tailings ponds, but b4 going out to fill up w  132.9, I listened to Conservative rep for N AB saying how current Feds not providing enuf $ to employ EI-ended workers to get out there 2do just that!
1197 2018-11-01 21:37:12 The vehicle I drive now is an SUV, that I spend roughly $60 - $120 a week in fuel, every 10k miles approximately $100 for oil changes, has had 3 safety recalls on it since 2017, and the lift gate and rain sensors have failed three times and needed replacing.
1198 2018-11-01 21:37:11 LA tip - don't use the weather app on your phone to check the temperature outside! Just see if your coconut oil is a solid or a liquid and dress accordingly
1199 2018-11-01 21:37:03 Fucc I’m over here thinking it said OIL
1200 2018-11-01 21:36:41 It's a farce,  Iran is an OIL obstruction for the SAUDIS. Dangerous game you're playing. US Allies are NOT subjects of Donald Trump's royal court.  DJT refused to put #sanctions on KGB Putin after he (& MILITARY Intel!) attacked US, until  forced to belatedly and grudgingly sign.
1201 2018-11-01 21:36:38 essential oil is calming, so sometimes I have a diluted spray that I’ll spray on my chest and behind my neck.

I keep my room really clean and minimal bc too much stuff + messy stresses me out more. Minimalism helps a lot of people with anxiety actually. 

Not having caffeine +
1202 2018-11-01 21:36:36 I hope you Dip Stick that monkey  check his oil
1203 2018-11-01 21:36:34 I do need an oil change lol
1204 2018-11-01 21:36:31 ty pres trump. "US oil output topped 11 million barrels a day in August for the first time ever...That's more than either Russia or Saudi Arabia." now, we r truly energy independent: we dont have to consider oil when making decisions involving the middle east. what an improvement

1206 2018-11-01 21:36:26 But Canada has a very expensive type of crude. Oil sands vs. Light sweet
1207 2018-11-01 21:36:22 That was penned by a bunch of pedo big oil state pension funds from places like Oregon right?
1208 2018-11-01 21:36:19 They love to control the world through manipulating oil prices this is why we need more green energy!
1209 2018-11-01 21:36:09 They did 9/11 And we rewarded them by taking out their enemy and competition Iraq and put an embargo against their other oil competitor Iran and we sell them weapons that gives them regional dominance. I guess we don't have many friends over there!
1210 2018-11-01 21:36:02 อิอิ.
1211 2018-11-01 21:36:02 you speak Adrian. dont be intimidated.
1212 2018-11-01 21:36:00 You also dont expect your car insurance to cover basic maintenance like oil changes or brake jobs. Medical insurance should be hospital/er/catastrophic, or birth coverage only. It would force open competition amongst general practitioners and lower costs across the board
1213 2018-11-01 21:35:55 When u use condom & she still gets pregnant jst knw d oil in d condom is anointing oil. U cannot come and waste children.

1215 2018-11-01 21:35:46 Oil and it's a VERY handy boogeyman for socialism. Just means you have to pretend to not know about democratic socialism in Europe or crony capitalism in Russia et al.
1216 2018-11-01 21:35:45 APC said petrol price shld b #79, not #97 durn Jonathans tenure.

1220 2018-11-01 21:35:34 Because they are just in other areas of the world looking for oil. America has the greatest oil reserve in the world. That is a fact.

You’ve saved my ears from bloody James Blunt
1222 2018-11-01 21:34:58 Just been looking at details of an asset manager's ESG investment strategy option, no "unethical or unsustainable activities". Top holdings: oil & gas exploration companies, giant supermarket chain, large petrol station chain owner, US multinational conglomerate...
1223 2018-11-01 21:34:49 If oil and water don’t mix.
Being messy and anointed won’t either.
1224 2018-11-01 21:34:47 George Bush invaded Iraq and took all their oil. They store the reserves in Area 51. We must access these reserves immediately and give them to Native Americans as reparations!
1225 2018-11-01 21:34:37 I need some wild hair growth oil
1226 2018-11-01 21:34:27 what you need

Quaker oats
Honey
peanut butter
a little groundnut oil
there is a method of mixing it to prepare a paste.
it is given to malnourished children and in two weeks they swell up like balloons
1227 2018-11-01 21:34:15 And the problem is you can't really talk about it on here or LSE . You just get trolled or words twisted or stupid allegations made up at you. 

Then you join some group and it's got some idiots in there acting about 12 years old. So you leave.
1228 2018-11-01 21:34:08 We are now selling CBD Hemp Oil!

1231 2018-11-01 21:33:42 Trump can say and do whatever he wants because of two simples reasons: the dolar and the bombs. Bolsonaro is a fool. If China stops buying soya and oil he will change his mind in a minute.
1232 2018-11-01 21:33:41 Did Nothing with Fuel Duty

1234 2018-11-01 21:33:38 Slide the dms
1235 2018-11-01 21:33:30 Our job is not to be nice to oil and gas or nice to the pro-112 folks. Our job is to report on what is happening and the anti-112 group is preventing that from happening Tues night by locking out the press. It's fairly elementary Robert and I think you know it.
1236 2018-11-01 21:33:16 Coconut oil maybe, bag balm no
1237 2018-11-01 21:33:12 as far as maintenance an electric motor is a LOT less complicated than an internal combustion engine with many fewer moving parts. An EV requires, no oil changes, no exhaust or muffler work, no brake pads, no spark plugs or fluid top ups (outside brake and window washer) etc
1238 2018-11-01 21:33:10 This is just one example & an insight into the heart of God! To comfort all who mourn and provide for all who grieve. To bestow on them a crown of beauty, instead of ashes. To give the oil of joy, instead of mourning & provide a garment of praise, instead of a spirit of despair.
1239 2018-11-01 21:32:50 He’ll say anything.  A true snake oil salesman.
1240 2018-11-01 21:32:46 My skin can double as an oil mine, I’ll try the primer!!

1242 2018-11-01 21:32:36 Psalms 23: 5-6~
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies; thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.

She would easily catch up to Harley, regardless of the oil she took, but instead of grabbing her, she +

1255 2018-11-01 21:31:15 Big pharma and big oil run this country.
1256 2018-11-01 21:31:15 Yes!! It works so good, I mix a little more coconut oil than shea butter and how ever much castor oil u think tbh lol and yah honestly doing ur own experiments with stuff like that always turns out better. And if u don’t like the texture u get w that mixture just melt it down

1270 2018-11-01 21:29:12 Sometimes I like to use butter instead of vegetable oil when I cook...it just makes things tasted 10xs better
1271 2018-11-01 21:29:06 The world wants our oil its just that Canadians get in the way from getting it to market. Mostly the people that vote NDP and green party. They believe that we can replace 30% of our economy overnight with the flick of a switch.

再度、おめラジラでした
本日もﾖﾛｼｸｵﾈｶﾞｲｼﾏｽ
1280 2018-11-01 21:28:39 It was coiled around multiple times starting from the very bottom and the top part actually protruded above the water line like a cobra. Astonishing. Too bad camera phones didn’t exist then.
1281 2018-11-01 21:28:37 Why does going to get my oil change make me wanna cry? I should not be this awkward anymore
1282 2018-11-01 21:28:37 I HAVE THE MOST WONDERFUL NEWS.

Doc took my word for it that all is well in the hinterlands. NO OIL CHECK.
1283 2018-11-01 21:28:34 If I was able to I would feed them both. We can do both. Medicare for all and homes for the homeless could be done fairly easily. If we stopped cutting taxes for millionaires and billionaires and ended subsidies for oil companies. We could house the homeless and give healthcare
1284 2018-11-01 21:28:31 Commissioning of the first batch of modular refineries owned strictly by indigenes is scheduled for December 2018. There are still some grants and concessions given to Niger deltans even though I think the govt and Oil operators shld do more.  13% shd be jacked up for a start.
1285 2018-11-01 21:28:28 you know i stay STRAPPED w that body oil
1286 2018-11-01 21:28:28 Stop wasting money on oil pipelines and build out our space program. Build a space centre and launch complex.
1287 2018-11-01 21:28:26 Roasting some butternut squash in olive oil, brown sugar, cinnamon, cayenne pepper, and S&P. I will brown it under the broiler for a minute before serving. With a petite roast chicken and rice, with a little curry jus. Nice fall meal.
1288 2018-11-01 21:28:21  how many times is this so called oil discovered. Kwanai kani
1289 2018-11-01 21:28:19 Our hands are not clean. Not only Vietnam. Allende in Chile was going to nationalize the mines.. Pres. of Guatemala was going to nationalize the banana plantations. Mosaddegh in Iran was going to nationalize oil. All democratically elected all overthrown by our CIA.
1290 2018-11-01 21:28:09 Depends on the form. If it's touching water it's an oily based liquid. Which means it acts like oil. Which makes it easy to remove since it just floats on the top of water. It doesn't mix with the water. Come on, try harder
1291 2018-11-01 21:28:06 I was referring to something not on the open market National Reserve is just that a bunch of cans of oil
1292 2018-11-01 21:28:05 BSKSSNNDF I FIGURED THAT OUT AFTER.. I THOUGHT IT WAS A MIC AND SHE WAS PUTTING OIL DROPS ON IT AND I WAS LIKE OMG ARIANA GRANDE ASMR BITCH
1293 2018-11-01 21:27:52 Why are oil changes so damn high 
1294 2018-11-01 21:27:49 It wasn't not selling oil to us that cause the problem.  It was moving off the dollar while selling their oil that did it.  We didn't like them kicking out foreign countries and nationalizing their own resources but moving off the dollar?  That we couldn't stand for.
1295 2018-11-01 21:27:42 Delivering Scotland our own wealth back after taking Westminster's slice of our oil cake?

Cake used to pay off the Tories DUP debt just to get your rich tax cut budget passed

Scotland funding still down £1.9bn over 8 years and benefits frozen

1301 2018-11-01 21:27:11 Signed VA Choice Act and VA Accountability Act, expanded VA telehealth services, walk-in-clinics, and same-day urgent primary and mental health care. Increased our coal exports by 60 percent; U.S. oil production recently reached all-time high.
1302 2018-11-01 21:27:08 Those early leaders who piped oil from south all the way to the North for refining were smoking rubber..
1303 2018-11-01 21:27:00 That's got to be well over 50 now.
1304 2018-11-01 21:26:59 took the plunge and bought some shatter(ButHO) to bring home. 0.5g og kush $25. I don't have a rig. tried the METHod(tinfoil). got a buzz. it was pretty fail though. I don't recommend it. smoke it like oil in a pipe. stack ashes, and work in bots. bot 2 and i'm fucked.

1310 2018-11-01 21:26:32 I read the NYT Bolton story.  He isn’t backing off.  He says you can’t let up, but he understands of Iran’s neighbors can’t go to zero on Iranian oil Immediately

So this is all Brookings
1311 2018-11-01 21:26:32 Do you know I was watching the SP on L2 outside the gates at HH. The MMs got so pissed off with me as soon as I uploaded a tanker to twitter they would drop the SP at one stage.. 

You know . They are supposed to make a market.
1312 2018-11-01 21:26:28 If you talk they would say its a lie! Even while hands are deep soaked in red oil.
1313 2018-11-01 21:26:27 Chemically given meaning the oils extracted from certain medically grown cannabis.. CBD oil etc.
1314 2018-11-01 21:26:23 I got an oil change today & in the waiting room there was an Oprah magazine. I drew devil horns & a mustache on her face & wrote ‘satan’ on the cover. lol I’m immature, but also honest.

1316 2018-11-01 21:25:46 We are in Lake City Wyoming headed to Cheyenne, WY.

The weather has been fantastic. No rain, no snow, no ice, no high winds.

The 1992 Ford F150 4x4 truck i bought is running fine. Did go through a quart of oil, no big deal.
1317 2018-11-01 21:25:44 Someone in a #YouMatter hoodie just gave me 20$ off my oil change 
1318 2018-11-01 21:25:26 ...how can you tell a friend you want some help getting an oil change?
1319 2018-11-01 21:25:21 Hello David blue planet has made such a big difference, massively increasing awareness around plastic pollution. What a great positive impact. I’d love you to do a series on palm oil, iconic Indonesian Leuser ecosystem. Would love people making palm oil free choices#orangutan

1323 2018-11-01 21:24:53 I  Free oil changes and tire rotations.

1327 2018-11-01 21:24:30 I did. There's oil on my head. Nothing to worry about again.
1328 2018-11-01 21:24:28 Ok, for all of you who are going to back the oil companies and vote against the carbon tax. Just FYI it is 64 degrees and Nov 1st in Western Washington. May need to re-think your vote.
1329 2018-11-01 21:24:07 Venezuela has always been a poor country you melt. It is a poor country being 
strangled by Americas economic sanctions.Also Venezuela is an oil economy.When the price of oil collapsed that also hurt the economy.
1330 2018-11-01 21:24:04 Have some olive oil. Stop begging.
1331 2018-11-01 21:24:02 Any oil or lotion will help the band aid come off easily
1332 2018-11-01 21:23:51 Also Secretary Perdue what is USDA doing to develop USA Ocean fish farms similar to Scandinavia, SE Asia, and South America?  Is there any work being done on using Oil platforms as the structural basis for fish farms?  Again thank you for communicating your Life Lessons.
1333 2018-11-01 21:23:46 I've been at work 4 and a half hours and I've been thinking about going home for 4 and a half hours.
I can't go home for another 5 hours. Seriously thinking about putting my head in an oil vat.
1334 2018-11-01 21:23:46 Great video. Unanouced gig Live on the Roof Top of their Apple Studios in Saville Row.  

Brought Mayfair and the West End to a halt.
1335 2018-11-01 21:23:36 Are you suggesting our Courts that saw through this NEB / AB charade are unreasonable ? Rachel you are wrong . & what is worse - you know you are ! But big oil will ensure that you are not re-elected
1336 2018-11-01 21:23:30 Need prayers for my nephew. He was seriously injured in an oil rig accident yesterday. He has a severe head injury skull fracture bleeding on his brain. Broken neck,and almost tore his arm off. Already had 2surgeries on his arm to try and save it. Only God can fix this.
1337 2018-11-01 21:23:26 An eastern Canada oil pipeline will probably kill the railway into the maritimes.  I tweeted this a few years ago.  Prices would then skyrocket.
1338 2018-11-01 21:23:23 Venezuela was the richest country in South America due to its oil reserves......squandered by Chavez and Maduro, ruined by #socialism
1339 2018-11-01 21:23:08 I still think we should determine what it costs putin to get oil & gas out of the ground. Then offer to sell the EU all the oil & gas they need at that price less $5 @ bbl FOB Rotterdam. Reagan bankrupted the USSR with star wars, didn't tire a shot. Same idea.
1340 2018-11-01 21:23:05 @NOLAnews Approving this project anew makes a mockery of City government. If the City Council approves this again, then they have been bought and paid for by oil and gas.  The State should fine @EntergyNOLA @Entergy  Corruption on the backs of the poor.
1341 2018-11-01 21:23:03 In college some guys would leave art in the toilets. Several were so impressive many people came to see it. I’ve never seen a turd that big around or that long before or since. It was a wonder to behold.
1342 2018-11-01 21:23:00 Son it’s time for a oil change already I’m tired spending money on this car !!
1343 2018-11-01 21:22:59 Just days after #Venezuela announced it has stopped pricing oil in #USD.  Coincidence? Or a warning shot to #Russia and #OPEC to not disrupt #America's "#ExorbitantPrivilege" as the world's reserve currency?  @USTradeRep @WhiteHouse @PressSec @larry_kudlow
1344 2018-11-01 21:22:58 So I’ve been using Shea Moisture’s coffee and coconut oil exfoliation scrub, and my skin looks awesome. Just wanted to share.
1345 2018-11-01 21:22:44 Hurt so fkn bad. But I had cbd oil in my mouth so I was screaming w my mouth closed basically lmfao as if my brother, in the next room, didn't feel the whole house shake but 10 mins later he comes in, line "WHAT" WHAT?! so he had to help me around that night but he left

1352 2018-11-01 21:21:48 The USA beef w Venezuela began when USA oil companies were told to fuck off and leave the oil, and that’s a big no no to@do vs USA, even Iran paid a heavy price when they did that, and Iraq and Lybia... oil belongs to USA or else you have problems...
1353 2018-11-01 21:21:39 Dead off point wrong. EU work feverishly to protect alliance w/Iran?? #EU #HONORS International Agreements,  DT eager to renege b4 privy to it.

1358 2018-11-01 21:21:21 This reminds me about the time I informed my male boss in 1984 that I was pregnant with my second child - ‘I thought you had more oil in your wick’ was the reply - I left the job the next month!

1361 2018-11-01 21:21:00 Somewhere in the world an art student is making their thesis project of giant photorealistic oil paintings of hole pics they received on Grindr, and honestly I’m here for it.
1362 2018-11-01 21:20:59 Our kitchen door has developed the most hilarious squeak. 
Best described as sounding like an angry gannet. 
I shall harvest this squeak for sound design before I oil the hinges. Of course.

1366 2018-11-01 21:20:22 By the time my oil gets changed I could have probably taught myself how to do it.

1374 2018-11-01 21:19:23 To each their own certainly but... Buy a sack of nice apples, slice em up, dip em in a ground superhot, dehydrate. Little effort, great flavor. That ingredient list seems to us more than a bit lame. 
Palm Oil, seriously?
1375 2018-11-01 21:19:21 CONGRATULATIONS

1377 2018-11-01 21:19:00 It's run by a Looney Left Mafia stealing the only resource that country has in abundance: oil.
1378 2018-11-01 21:18:59 Me with my husband the last time I had my car in for an oil change “Well can you FaceTime me so I can see the leak for myself?” “David, I’m literally watching oil drip in front of my own eyes what more do you need??”

1380 2018-11-01 21:18:50 Thanks and excellent points!  Still, it's better for the US to be using more of its own #oil than...#MbS'.   #SaudiArabia #MiddleEast #energy #fossilfuels

1386 2018-11-01 21:18:11 I don't understand  how this got to my name from the issue of oil deposits. I don't know.
1387 2018-11-01 21:18:09 But NOT a FLUSHER, apparently. Good G-d, we don't all need to admire your... "art"
1388 2018-11-01 21:18:07 I know you are a doctor.  But I thought you were burning at midnight oil for CC18.

1409 2018-11-01 21:15:41 Bitcoin  is the new oil
1410 2018-11-01 21:15:25 You can add some essential oil so that it doesn’t smell so much like shea butter
1411 2018-11-01 21:15:25 Don’t know what kinda oil changes they hustling you out of
1412 2018-11-01 21:15:20 Gunna got that oil change and he ready to ride lol. He just alil thirsty now.

1414 2018-11-01 21:15:12 Ulta lip oil in passionate peach
1415 2018-11-01 21:14:58 Melt down some shea butter, add melted unrefined coconut oil and castor oil. Then let it set in the freezer for a few hours until it’s hardened slightly. That stuff helps sooo much. It takes time but definitely makes a big difference
1416 2018-11-01 21:14:53 Secret is to work the dough to get it stretchy once you pull it apart. If it has too many holes and gaps, work it some more. And for the yeast, use warm water instead of hot. :)

And don’t forget the olive oil all over the dough ball before putting it to rise.

1422 2018-11-01 21:14:12 The market currently exists to support the US dollar, it's also been claimed that drug money helped bail out the world central banking system, as oil, arms and drugs are all traded in the reserve currency of  the dollar, protected by the US military.

1424 2018-11-01 21:14:09 Hajjaju kinsan zunubin da zaki samu ga duk Wanda yaga pic dinnan
1425 2018-11-01 21:14:02 I could accept that to a degree but none of the food products factor that in. Palm oil, soy almonds hemp etc all extract from the land with no polluter costs so the plant based industry would have to factor that in room and we would be back to a level playing field.
1426 2018-11-01 21:13:58 Keep in mind that china’s two largest oil companies may have been ordered to zero imports.
1427 2018-11-01 21:13:49 Well he says that oil tycoons try to prevent innovation in energy like the Tesla car ..they don’t like electric cars ..bad for the oil business
1428 2018-11-01 21:13:44 Remember your handle. 
Your post? Not to do w/EU, US reneging on International agreement, sanctions on or Iran,  Waters has an opposing view to Trump who gave big Oil obscene amounts of tax dollars, cont it's free ride as they cost USA every other way. They can both be dead wrong

1438 2018-11-01 21:11:40 Can he do CBD oil? or is it not legal there? I'm like a encyclopedia of alternative treatments..(well working toward it). Or otherwise Neurofeedback has shown great results for improving and even fixing it completely. I can send you in-depth content on Neurofeedback & CBD. - Jena

1452 2018-11-01 21:10:44 I said a while back that Crude Oil should head to lower by next spring to 58-62 range by next spring. Could have a short term rally, but charts are giving sell signals. Bear Flag! Profit taking for Short Oats were filled today. at 281. #Commodities #Crude #Agriculture #Oats

1468 2018-11-01 21:09:35 We the people of Muzarabani won't get europhoric about this. This same kind of state nostalgia happened in 1990s when oil was first 'discovered' and I dont see this as real news. Maybe this government wants to divert gullible Zimbabweans from real issues. Hapana hapana.

1474 2018-11-01 21:08:32 Now do the Arab slave trade that existed centuries before Europeans began using slaves. When will the Arabs deserve to take people in and redistribute their oil wealth as reparations?

What’s needed

1 tin tuna
1 can chopped tomatoes or passata
Some dried herbs (oregano basil thyme)
Salt pepper
Dried Parmesan 
And dried pasta or spaghetti 

All that’s needed fresh is a little oil and an onion.

1513 2018-11-01 21:04:07 With tourism, they can at least have what they own and gain from it however little it is. Of what good will be the coal mine if they don't want it for they won't own it?  People up north don't own ngamia oil wells; they are milked dry instead as are the titanium mines in Kwale.
1514 2018-11-01 21:03:57 @kevincramer has had Trumps Sr. & Jr., Willber Ross, the VP, Sec. Zinkey ...to name a few more raising money for him, pluse going to Texas instead of meeting at Big Iron. He wouldn't be running for Senate unless a big oil man hadn't put cash into the campaign!

1515 2018-11-01 21:03:55 Whats going to happen to all the political bull shit and oil leaders across the world when electricity starts to take over and profits and GeoPower start to slump ?
1516 2018-11-01 21:03:54 Straight up. Easier that way. Except I do drain the olive oil.

To me, fish generally doesn’t taste as it smells, as long as it’s not spoiled. But it’s the same thing with meat when you think about it.

Note: It can take 5 or 6 tries to get adjusted to sardines. It’s fine. 
1517 2018-11-01 21:03:49 Moisture is your friend. I know it seems to go against everything you think because humidity may cause frizz but you need a cream or oil that's light but will help quench your thirsty hair! I use a tiny bit of coconut oil and some sea salt spray for texture. Changed my life!

1580 2018-11-01 20:57:54 Its ok to promise review of fuel price. Its better than giving a figure because you really cant tell the challenges the oil market is likely to face in the nearest future. In fact, the market is not as robust as it used to be few years back. 
A lot has changed and still changing.
1581 2018-11-01 20:57:46 My car is dying too \o/ change that oil~
1582 2018-11-01 20:57:36 Fact, PDP Party governed Nigeria,16yrs of our last 19yrs(1999-2015) Fact, revenue from Oil within the 16yrs, was above $650billion. Fact, no infrastructure for future growth on the ground today, to show for all the revenue realized within that period. Fact Poverty and death today

1601 2018-11-01 20:54:52 This 3 yrs is way better than the past 16yrs of our democracy when oil revenue was all time high. Pensioners are now been paid, school feeding, Npower, Tradermoni, Agriculture has improved, Bailout out funds to Govs, roads, rails, Airports, 2nd NB, Aba-PH road etc.
1602 2018-11-01 20:54:52 You know, I don't know the difference between regular and extra virgin olive oil, but I really think we need to stop whoever it is that keeps having sex with the olives.

1606 2018-11-01 20:54:11 If NDP is worried about exhausting oil resources and that is why the government is not in favour of building pipelines then there exist diversification in Alberta to run its economy. For example Alberta is 2nd largest producer of wheat in Canada.

1650 2018-11-01 20:47:40 Ok thanks. So far his ministers, specifically oil, electric, and construction/housing seem to be able to flip the playing field. Not sold on the finance minister. Maybe in 3 to 6 months I'll change my mind. The program he put forth today looks impressive

1684 2018-11-01 20:44:20 .@Interior said today it disbursed $44.8m in energy revs to CA in latest fiscal yr, reflecting funds from oil & gas produced on federal & Indian lands + offshore areas. That figure represents a nearly 24% rise from the previous yr.  CA is #3 in crude oil production among states.

1688 2018-11-01 20:43:56 Fuel price hiked by almost 50%, cost of living skyrocketed by more than 100%, salary remain stagnant. If the price of oil price in the international market is low, shouldn’t it translate to reduction of PMS in the local market? Low cost price should lead to low selling price.

1701 2018-11-01 20:43:07 From a resurgence of FB products, fyi people, you cannot “fix” dead hair or split ends. Smother it in olive oil if it’s intensely damaged and sleep in it and only rinse it for a week before washing or use coconut oil before and after bleaching without actually washing to preserve
1702 2018-11-01 20:42:56 Corruption is the problem. Like Diamond of Chiadzwa, this oil will benefit only a few.

1717 2018-11-01 20:40:50 From the article and more

1. Nigeria don’t refine its crude oil which is effectively taking away our only source of revenue.           2. Indirectly our crude oil business and resultant PMS from it is being run at a deficit of N53/litre.

1731 2018-11-01 20:38:51 It’s hard to shift a country’s credit rating - we are now onto old oil reserves.  Unfortunately this is a bait creditors won’t go for easily. If exploration drilling by 2020, you will be very lucky to have commercial mining by 2025. Probably looking at 2030 if one is realistic.

1737 2018-11-01 20:38:05 Scheduled an appointment for an oil change but instead I selected maintenance...now they’re going to tell me to buy new tires and that I need to buy a fridge for my car 
1738 2018-11-01 20:37:40 Is there a bigger ripoff in the automotive industry than the $2.00 crush ring the stealership sells you with oil filters? Probably costs 5c to make.
1739 2018-11-01 20:37:36 That's nice for y'all with your vaults and bunkers, but if the price of oil spikes like it did under Dubya, people will die.  They will freeze to death in their homes.
1740 2018-11-01 20:37:17 Big 3 will be gone in a few years. They can't can't pivot from their oil based, high maintenance (profit), overpriced (2nd biggest purchase for most people), low horsepower, business model.

1783 2018-11-01 20:31:40 What is this delay with cannabis oil ?
Prohibition never works..
1784 2018-11-01 20:31:21 "There's more employees in BC Tech than oil & gas, mining, and forestry combined" - @ACLServices CEO Laurie Schultz blows our minds at Women in Leadership 3.0
1785 2018-11-01 20:31:12 Wow! Really? With all of those rich, oil producing countries right there, they can’t send food to Yemen? Kind of blows the whole “Islam is a religion of peace” theory out of the water.
1786 2018-11-01 20:31:01 Aw! I am deathly afraid of flying also. Meditation, lavender oil and a glass of wine will help!!!
1787 2018-11-01 20:30:59 Iam so sad. This has all the markings of the Chihnoyi diesel 'discovery' suddenly the supposed oil discovery will dryup and the government will be left warm and dry.
1788 2018-11-01 20:30:59 This idiot don't know what he is talking about. Thinks he is all knowing. All he is, is a snake oil seller.
1789 2018-11-01 20:30:58 I take high grade fish oil capsules - I’m convinced they help my skin and and knees but whether they actually do or not? 
1790 2018-11-01 20:30:37 2 weeks na akong hindi nakakapag-Skincare Saturday so I'm excited to tell you about my ultimate weapon, an anti-aging face oil cocktail I jokingly call the Enrile Elixir. Abangan niyo, mga Ka-GGSS.

1793 2018-11-01 20:30:32 I think my car slipped on oil on the highway and I almost fucked myself up :)
1794 2018-11-01 20:30:10 LMAOOOO and I need a oil change this weekend smh
1795 2018-11-01 20:30:09 Ideally, yes. Unfortunately a lot of coal/oil worldwide heats homes. The #1 polluter, Chinese coal (and all coal really), should be pressured into extinction, tho, and fast. Past that, most consumers refuse to acknowledge their personal contribution by driving/flying/buying junk.
1796 2018-11-01 20:30:08 He doesn't care about veterans if he did care about veterans there wouldn't be so many homeless veterans in the United States. If Republicans cared about veterans they wouldn't have sent them to fight two Wars for oil.
1797 2018-11-01 20:30:02 This, however for about a week until the soap has absorbed the oil.
1798 2018-11-01 20:30:01 All of the “hot” and “popular” girls in high school have tried selling me Herbalife, Avon, nail polish, purses, dog clothing and now... CBD oil. Who really created a Ponzi scheme out of CBD oil? 
1799 2018-11-01 20:29:53 Its definitely not enough for me lol with all the driving I do, I should be getting an oil change every 2-3 mths.
1800 2018-11-01 20:29:30 Razor doesn't give bumps if you moisturize with coconut oil immediately after & maybe even a few days after as well

Wax hurts more if the hair is long 

Taking care of yourself is a full time job 
1801 2018-11-01 20:29:28 On the west coast, CBD oils come with higher amounts of THC. People who work in the MMJ industry in CA say that creates an "entourage effect." The oil you get in a CA dispensary is very different than what you would find in NYC. Patients are even advised against CBD only oils.
1802 2018-11-01 20:29:27 Where’d you spill oil?
1803 2018-11-01 20:29:11 YO! We are BACK today on @idobiradio with one of our fave fellas, the brilliantly talented @Parvesh, talking the election, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, and bulletproof coffee made with weed-infused coconut oil. (Spoiler: it's strong.) Tune in 7 pm EST/4 pm PST! #weed #idobi #potcast
1804 2018-11-01 20:29:08 Why yes, we do put lavender essential oil in the diffuser for the dog while we aren’t home. #LAdog
1805 2018-11-01 20:29:01 Back to Showa Denko L-tryptophan epidemic and concerns Canada's food safety assessment of GMO should be more rigorous given similar symptoms with canola oil in Spanish toxic oil tragedy. GMO may have unintended consequences for some but how do you know if you don't toxi test?
1806 2018-11-01 20:28:56 You tried CBD oil? Working great for my boy X.
1807 2018-11-01 20:28:54 Mine are rocks, animals accept of spiders, they can burn in oil and coconut
1808 2018-11-01 20:28:52 If Chevron is donating to a PAC that's supporting you, that means Chevron wants you to win. You can disavow it all you want. Big oil thinks you're good, and people should be wary of that. 

Same with Quinn Delaney, a multi-property landlord from Piedmont who wants you to win.
1809 2018-11-01 20:28:50 Oil you say in Zim. 
1810 2018-11-01 20:28:42 This is bc of big oil, oligarchs, money for the few. It's why Colorado is forcing cabins to be on the grid. Yet internal combustion engines are what has been slowing the rate of growth since the 1970s. Solar/EV truly should be a matter of national security & urgency.
1811 2018-11-01 20:28:18 Tati gotta Oil Change!?!?? Holy smokes guys

1814 2018-11-01 20:27:59 Oh yes, run into the arms of Socialist/Marxist politicians. #JaredPolis is a socialist/Marxist. Is this what Colorado wants?? No jobs, higher taxes, Obamacare, no drilling for oil, gas, coal, minerals, more benefits for illegals but not for Coloradans.  NO TO POLIS
1815 2018-11-01 20:27:58 Idk  about cars so I just change the oil when the little sticker says it’s time, get new tires here and there,make sure the windshield wiper liquid is always full and hope everything works out for the best. 
1816 2018-11-01 20:27:58 Stop buying their oil first.
1817 2018-11-01 20:27:57 Need a transport driver? So you can relax more ofcourse

1819 2018-11-01 20:27:40 Sources say US will provide a waiver on Iran sanctions for India. Hope this is not overturned by a tweet. Unrealistic to expect India to go to 0 oil imports from Iran by November 4. U.S. can't have a strategic partnership with India and at the same time impose Iran sanctions.

1827 2018-11-01 20:26:48 We wouldn’t have any oil if we didn’t.

1841 2018-11-01 20:24:56 @liinxy Can we get a clarification if the sacred oil change is a cost reduction or a cost increase roughly?

1853 2018-11-01 20:23:24 Snake oil 101. If you think putting high doses of acid in your body is a good idea, go for it. You’ll regret it.
1854 2018-11-01 20:22:53 Who can watch this snake oil salesman?  WTF.
1855 2018-11-01 20:22:49 @simonjbridges “The truth of the matter is” petrol prices are falling and fast: US oil prices are sharply lower today, down more than -US$2.50/bbl.The Brent benchmark prices are just under  US$73/bbl. Rising supply and falling economic growth are factors pushing  the price lower.

1857 2018-11-01 20:22:35 I wish restaurants understood that if I’m ordering veggies I definitely don’t mean douse them in oil

1867 2018-11-01 20:21:20 Oil interests evidently want a new world order, based on enforced oil dependency, with GB, RU, and the US controlling the northern hemisphere, using creepy IT and private enforcers to keep pesky people of color (and those Europeans committed to fair elections) out.

1880 2018-11-01 20:19:36 THE BEST SANCTION WILL BE : STOP SELLING FUEL AND STOP BUYING ITS OIL

Statistically it's not possible except with 2 variables (our refineries are working or price of crude oil drop to $45). 
If both happens, he'll drop price otherwise subsidy will return fully and treasury will be looted again

Venezuela no longer trading oil in American money and has the Petro cryptocurrency backed by gold and oil
Iran doing the same thing.
All the countries demand for gold has highly increased.
1886 2018-11-01 20:19:04 What qualifies someone to be  president? Lawyers, politicians, and business men put america in trillions of dollars in debt. Gave the power to oil companies, tech companies, car manufactures. Put us in wars that weren’t needed.  No one is truly qualified to be president.

1889 2018-11-01 20:18:22  snake oil? O.k  point taken .no clean coal.But Southern co problems were design miscaculations, cost over runs and the unexpectedly low N.G prices due to shale gas. 
Which is why i wondered why Amu power cannot build an LNG fired plant . Which would still attract opposition

1895 2018-11-01 20:17:38 Israel annexed the Golan long before any oil was imagined. If there was any chance for peace the Golan would be on the table. Sinai has oil too yet israel returned it for peace.

1898 2018-11-01 20:17:22 I hate pessimists. We have found the cure for AIDS. Extracting oil in Muzarabani and benefitting our people is piddling stuff. We don't need a queen or even a bee to help us with that, even a Princess Nhunzi can do it. The future is bright!

1905 2018-11-01 20:17:00 And w/Venezuelan production cratering, an oil spike could make other gains moot. Look for something big to happen w/ Russia+US regarding Iran & Venezuela post midterms IMHO. The Saudi royals are already in chaos.If Venezuala can be brought back on line w/ new Iran deal, look out.

1907 2018-11-01 20:16:55 y’all wanna get my oil changed for me.
1908 2018-11-01 20:16:46 They lobby against them all the time, and lobby to have regulations removed so they can drill in more places, they’re playing both sides of the coin for profit, that’s all they care about, however sticking with oil is cheaper than switching to the forms of energy
1909 2018-11-01 20:16:45 Yes! I love ginger snaps, in general. I’m decarboxing today. And will have more cooking oil tomorrow. That sounds great.
1910 2018-11-01 20:16:41 Wrestling? Really? ..You are a fan of a "sport" with young & very in shape men who often oil themselves up and then wrestle each other in speedo's? 
..I'M SHOCKED! 
1911 2018-11-01 20:16:29 Be greatfull. Very greatfull.  Oh BTW, Some moms believed you could cure anything with a mustard patch, Castor oil, or an enema.

1914 2018-11-01 20:16:10 Except we have allowed ourselves to become dependent on Saudi oil. They can't bark too loudly or else.
1915 2018-11-01 20:16:01 How horrible is cooking with coconut oil? Can taste it in everything 
1916 2018-11-01 20:16:01 One of the biggest blatant lies by a company: 10 minute oil change that Express claims to be able to do.
1917 2018-11-01 20:15:44 Does the oil and shatter and such carry a different fine from the leaf?
1918 2018-11-01 20:15:39 @RachelNotley If you are not good enough to get Alberta off its reliance on oil and steer it into the 21st century then you are just not good enough.
1919 2018-11-01 20:15:13 Thank you for the reply. If oil in all 3 zones then it’s not an issue but that’s  a big If.

1926 2018-11-01 20:14:37 Speaking of logic and critical thinking, you mind telling me why it is so controversial to even suggest that maybe, JUST FREAKING MAYBE, people can make up their own minds about the video? Once again, I know that's not really a popular idea for some lot, but maybe at least try it
1927 2018-11-01 20:14:36 Kudos for not trying to sell these as snake oil. Us long-time sufferers know there's no cure but there's no shortage of scammers targeting the new, hopeful or desperate.
1928 2018-11-01 20:14:24 You will get. O help@from@this one. She and Trudeau talk out of both sides of their face. Condemn the Saudis for minor things but not too much. They need Saudi oil to keep eastern Canada warm and moving. They don't dare build a pipeline and become energy independent .

Gluten free.
From "deep sea fish." 
For her dog.
Who probably eats his own poop.
1931 2018-11-01 20:13:51 You need to focus on green energy not bending over for the oil lobby
1932 2018-11-01 20:13:48 How cheap u guys are ??? U know that our prices are linked with international oil market ..and u cheap journalists know that oil prices are getting higher ...and still u r criticizing @ImranKhanPTI govt?
1933 2018-11-01 20:13:43 i have to get my car oil changed and do some stuff before i head up to maryland tomorrow, so i won’t be able to get home until late 
1934 2018-11-01 20:13:42 It was bad enough when American oil titans were cozying up. This is next level.
1935 2018-11-01 20:13:39 I can change my tire, I can check my oil, I can jump a car, but I can’t put on make up.

(These are basics everyone should know)
1936 2018-11-01 20:13:39 I’m assuming he means that you’re not in need of one because you regularly change your oil
1937 2018-11-01 20:13:36 Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants:
1938 2018-11-01 20:13:35 I don't know why we always deal with companies with no operations elsewhere, it's always mega deals full of hot air. If it was really lucrative, Mobil Oil wouldn't have just walked away
1939 2018-11-01 20:13:30 Berm is the land mass/hill. Think dirt mound that wasn’t there previously that is there in MaM2
1940 2018-11-01 20:13:16 I haven't, but upping magnesium and taking CBD (hemp) oil helped me. Getting on the birth control pill where you only get 3 periods a year helped me, too. Mine were very hormone related - by regulating those dips/spikes in my hormones, it eliminated many headaches. Good luck!
1941 2018-11-01 20:13:04 Told you call me wen you get the oil 
1942 2018-11-01 20:12:59 Those were potential WWIIIs in the making. Saudi/Yeman presented a diff problem. Oil production stability and decades worth of dark secrets made pulling the rug out from the ruling family tricky if not impossible. Better relations with Russia were needed and an Iran plan.
1943 2018-11-01 20:12:56 wassup with bitches not getting oil changes
1944 2018-11-01 20:12:49 These are the days when I want a man by my side. I want him to drive me places, put air in my tires, check my oil, fill my tank up, carry my bags etc. I just want to be spoiled and need a break. Ugh.

1953 2018-11-01 20:11:52 so over years, top 5 oil & gas PSUs gave:

150 cr in 2016-2017

250 cr in 2017-2018?

"The fact remains that the contribution towards construction of Statue  does not qualify as CSR activity as per schedule VII of the Companies  Act, 2013" - CAG maintained.
1954 2018-11-01 20:11:51 @atiku I have just discovered you are a man with so much verbal magic to control the oil price when elected into office. Iran and Saudi Arabia controls the oil price in the global space, do you have a refinery in your bedroom? @OfficialPDPNig stop these devilish lies.
1955 2018-11-01 20:11:49 niggas got an oil change & don't know how to act
1956 2018-11-01 20:11:45 It takes the purpose and design of God, that when you are being squeezed and crushed, the making of juice and oil comes  out.
1957 2018-11-01 20:11:40 They buy oil from us.

1960 2018-11-01 20:11:19 Saudi Arabia is committing genocide in Yemen, armed by US and UK weapons. The journalist story may be taking headlines but doesn’t touch the extent of Saudi’s crimes. They are a chief fundraiser for ISIS, and Al-Queda before that. But they have oil, so we bombed Iraq instead
1961 2018-11-01 20:11:10 I’ve never tasted it myself. Some people use coconut oil too.
1962 2018-11-01 20:11:03 ما قطعوا جثثهم وذوبوها بالأسيد .

1967 2018-11-01 20:10:20 Sorry I went into a long meeting. We shall have a more constructive debate about this in the near future. I may appear to have been hard on @UmemeLtd yet the same is happening in the financial sector, oil sector, health, education and so on. We want Uganda to work for citizens.

1974 2018-11-01 20:08:39 So, you believe people can't make up their own mind?  Classic    Also, "rely on his word as a Senator" is one of the most hilarious phrases I've ever heard.
1975 2018-11-01 20:08:34 EU feverishly protecting alliances w/Iran?  Try #EU #HONORS International Agreements,  DT eager to renege before even privy to it. Ego. ALL things Obama OUT,  All Kushner (Netanyahu) IN.  OIL. Saudi terror fine! The 3 KILLED "peace" and bargaining chip to attain it.  Same reasons
1976 2018-11-01 20:08:31 Thats all they have as leverage..oil. Kinda have us by the balls.
1977 2018-11-01 20:08:23 Mai: my teacher just told us we use our great grandparents as oil for our cars
1978 2018-11-01 20:08:15 Putting the aroma oil to the humidifier.
1979 2018-11-01 20:08:11 Would you take your vehicle to a dealership for service that represents a different make than yours for an oil change? For example let a Honda store service your Toyota? #NotPoliticalPoll
1980 2018-11-01 20:08:10 GOOD LORD. I would like to volunteer to rub the oil on him next time he has a role like this...
1981 2018-11-01 20:08:09 Not on my gaming accessories, no, but I use boiled linseed oil mixed with poly on some furniture & use poly exclusively on wet-area furniture like cabinets in kitchens & baths.

Moisturize with almond oil.
1983 2018-11-01 20:07:56 Been where you have been, rest and get back on the meds... I have bought CBD oil and it helps with Anxiety and depression x
1984 2018-11-01 20:07:54 But it was still cheaper you are saying. Propane or natural gas is a better option for heating. What would you have done if the oil was substantially cheaper?
1985 2018-11-01 20:07:43 Try Botswana Oil. Or department of energy
1986 2018-11-01 20:07:26 Yea worst part of Obama administration was him looking other way on their abuses... been going on for decades 15 of 19 hijackers from there... fuck them and their oil.
1987 2018-11-01 20:07:26 The caravan is a human battering ram.  How many times does one have to hit our southern border before it breaks in.  We need to get medieval.  Break out the hot oil!
1988 2018-11-01 20:07:16 Calm down forget about politics.. When oil was sold at 107 to 109USD how many refineries were built? what were those funds used for to cater for subsidies? You could even remember in 2011 when subsidies were about to be removed. Now compared to when it's sold for 40 to 70
1989 2018-11-01 20:07:14 Its not always the sent to war as much as the wars and why. Fighting for your country ok but fighting for resources like oil is bullshit surely
1990 2018-11-01 20:07:06 Oil change bitch 
1991 2018-11-01 20:07:04 Pretty special day at Lucas Oil November 18, when the #colts induct Reggie Wayne into the Ring of Honor. Jim Irsay says Manning, Edge, Marvin, Saturday, Dallas, Brackett and more will be on hand for the ceremony.

1993 2018-11-01 20:06:57 Im out of olive oil. A portuguese nightmare.
1994 2018-11-01 20:06:48 you're right though, i feel like 50% of the calories come from the VERY liberal use of cooking oil

1996 2018-11-01 20:06:43 what I miss the most about having a girl is that now I have no one to rub coconut oil only face now.
1997 2018-11-01 20:06:19 Mayo is a lot of oil and salt ... that's what makes it a good flavour enhancer
1998 2018-11-01 20:06:19 When did I say mineral oil is "not" inert. If you understand physiology, mineral oil is NOT absorbed in the body!!!! It is INERT! The question I am asking is very different than what you are stating!
1999 2018-11-01 20:06:15 Commodity goods, like gold and oil? We publicly fund certain goods and services that we believe are best offered broadly to all, like roads, education, police, fire departments, Medicare & SS. How is that different than say, Sweden?
2000 2018-11-01 20:06:08 Uh cheaper electricity and fuel for all. So, negative cost. Im guessing you don't own coal or oil. Someone who owns coal or oil may... Oh wait! I see what's going on here.
2001 2018-11-01 20:06:04 kids in my town were putting olive oil in carts lmao
2002 2018-11-01 20:06:03 And as long this nation is hold hostage by " vanhu vaye" vane "chinhu chavo" that oil will make their stomachs grow bigger, while povo gets poorer

2004 2018-11-01 20:05:59 You have no clue with regard to the “if a tree falls” thing. It’s about the noise & not the tree falling. It’s a middle school logic/critical thinking thing about conditional statements. Good luck & please remember to vote on Nov 9th.
2005 2018-11-01 20:05:57 Would you take your vehicle to a dealership that represents a different make than yours for an oil change?
2006 2018-11-01 20:05:50 I spend my break hitting my oil pen and then i be stuck like whyyyyyyy’d i do that.

2014 2018-11-01 20:04:51 Copied from Ben Carson:
I have to admit, I always wondered what this part of Psalm 23 meant. I thought “He anoints my head with oil” was figurative language for God keeping the Psalmist healthy. 

I never knew this parallel.

Anoint my head with oil...

2017 2018-11-01 20:04:45 Snake oil solicitation is strictly prohibited in my neighborhood.
2018 2018-11-01 20:04:43 There would most likely be massive and prolonged scarcity cos the cheap (refined) oil would be  smuggled out to neighbouring countries. As usual.
2019 2018-11-01 20:04:41 If you play by this rule, you give propaganda more strength.

2024 2018-11-01 20:04:22 Prob. different where you are, but in these parts, some tests showed that--except for California extra virgin olive oil, strictly regulated--most "olive oil" for sale was not necessarily even olive oil.
2025 2018-11-01 20:04:16 Don't forget the palm oil! It's one of your favourite ingredients in all your products. Shame on you!! Hundred of animals dead!! your hands are full of blood!! #Dropdirtypalmoil #palmoil #savetheplanet @Greenpeace

2029 2018-11-01 20:04:00 Judging by  fat and lipid "experts" appointed by FSANZ your trust seriously misplaced.

2030 2018-11-01 20:03:53 JELIS did not use mineral oil as placebo and showed 19% RRR in MACE with 1.8g EPA. There goes your mineral oil not inert theory straight to the garbage can! $AMRN

2059 2018-11-01 20:01:04 I have tried everything...but what I found that helps the most is CBD OIL.  When pot is legal here where I live, and it will be soon ,I plan on medical marijuana....keep in mind there is a difference between the two.
There is NO THC IN CBD OIL THEREFORE YOU CANNOT GET HIGH.

2072 2018-11-01 20:00:06 Translation, no oil from Canada.
2073 2018-11-01 19:59:47 Oil rig is only half a billion
Why not do it ourselves we are operating rigs un Texas in Angola in Saudi! 

Kupusa ndokuziva
2074 2018-11-01 19:59:40 This is me except with putting a lot of chili oil in my pho.
2075 2018-11-01 19:59:40 Tis the season for me to drown myself in CBD oil & ibuprofen. Bye.
2076 2018-11-01 19:59:31  аааа, спасибочки, мне очень-очень нравится. Я ведь просто обожаю подобный стиль.
2077 2018-11-01 19:59:20 cbd oil one drop every night before bed sublingual ,  in the morning 8 oz glass of water with 1/4 oz of braggs apple cider vinegar drink before any other foods,  and think about the gut balancing therapy of Biome Restoration Ltd from England.  I have been clear of the pain.
2078 2018-11-01 19:59:06 Where is red oil naa 
2079 2018-11-01 19:59:03 Awesome of you!!
2080 2018-11-01 19:58:41 I do need an oil change lol but that’s scheduled for next week! Might have a winter coat? Idk lol
2081 2018-11-01 19:58:40 Hi Andrew, 
The 'Eyes' posted a tanker this morning, there may have been more as I've only just come back on.
Ignore the boards, infested with derampers, traders & the misguided.
There is so much oil & good news at the mo with another RNS imminent every reason to be upbeat
2082 2018-11-01 19:58:36 Yeah she takes a while to start sometimes, but it only leaks a few drops of oil
2083 2018-11-01 19:58:26 My opinion: my government did so back then because they felt like American intelligence pawns. Remember, this was anti-imperialist Chаvismo before the Pink Tide, the rise of oil prices and the big role of Cuba in Venezuelan affairs.
2084 2018-11-01 19:58:21 True talk, everybody na criminal... ordinary campaign rice nd groundnut oil, some of them won’t still release bcoz they are in-charge yet all blames goes to @NGRPresident
2085 2018-11-01 19:58:15 To reiterate: Until a few years ago, Canada had no issue with oil producers' dependence on the US market. Then the oil industry caused the US shale revolution. Clearly the government has to (thanklessly) save the industry from its self-inflicted wounds. #cdnpoli #abpoli
2086 2018-11-01 19:58:05 if crude oil is free. Y not 
2087 2018-11-01 19:58:02 Nope. Radical left would be shutting off oil pipelines, inconvenient for a lot of people, hurts profit margins, but does not actually harm people. Radical and left. Non violent. You being wrong is not a fallacy on my part. You're argument takes them off the left. That's all.
2088 2018-11-01 19:58:01 I'm in a coffee shop with @anorianb overhearing a white guy mansplain how he alone brought CBD oil to NYC and I hope he's actively giving a bunch of his proceeds from his not real business to POC with weed convictions and actively working to change laws so he's not THE WORST MAN
2089 2018-11-01 19:57:38 Most personal decisions have communal consequences. Be considerate. It's one finger that touches the palm oil that soils the whole hand. 
2090 2018-11-01 19:57:37 I swear he was beating up a clown too.  Or two.  One landed on me while the black oil... ok enough on the black oil.  But Erik became a badass while in there.  I seem to remember telling off a little girl however.
2091 2018-11-01 19:57:31 I need to get my tags, smog my car, do an oil change, and all that gay ass car shit
2092 2018-11-01 19:57:29 Really? Hahaha
2093 2018-11-01 19:57:15 My People,

The information on the Muzarabani Gas & Oil reserves has been there since 19Mugabe.

It's not a discovery,It's a confirmation!
2094 2018-11-01 19:57:12 Knowing those two; they are already dreaming about buying an English soccer team with the oil money they will loot.
2095 2018-11-01 19:57:11 Day off from programming means car wash and oil change.

2104 2018-11-01 19:56:03 What’s a week of oil on water between friends?
2105 2018-11-01 19:55:57 Fashola and amaechi led the protest to share the excess crude oil fund... Dumb head!
2106 2018-11-01 19:55:53 We trying to Quench the fire and u pouring oil in it,what to you make out of this G?
2107 2018-11-01 19:55:51 Eskimo oil... and whiskey!
2108 2018-11-01 19:55:47 What is bonkers is stitting on energy while buying oil from terrorists and very dangerouse russians.
2109 2018-11-01 19:55:38 We use Oregano Oil for colds and flu - WORKS GREAT!
2110 2018-11-01 19:55:37 Exactly I asked for an oil change not a full ass diagnosis of my car lol
2111 2018-11-01 19:55:33 The price of PMS, Diesel or Kerosene is dependent on the cost of crude oil, so unless the price of crude falls drastically to say $40 per barrel and the refining and logistic cost is minimal. Then 90naira PMS is a mere wish(at $1=305).
2112 2018-11-01 19:55:28 "if we can’t have their oil, neither will they… Regime change (one way or another) is coming in the relatively near future and Baha’is must be there when a new regime is established to make their mark on the new government and help move it in genuinely new directions…"

2114 2018-11-01 19:55:11 You all remember when Trump got ANWR opened up, something no one could do for 40 years because of the environmental lobby and told the oil companies to drill baby drill? 

Good times, good times.

2116 2018-11-01 19:54:51 They changed my oil one time and didn't put the cap back on.  Before I got home oil blower out all over my engine.  I had them pay to get my engine cleaned and got free oil change for 6 months. After that I never went to them again

2121 2018-11-01 19:54:13 Britain has proven time and time again that they prefer oil deals at the detriment of her citizens. They abandoned Mazi Nnamdi Kanu to die in detention in Nigeria likewise David Day. Next time, before you become a British citizen you should consider whether it's worth it.
2122 2018-11-01 19:54:10 OP phyto is worse under hot temps and also depends on the variety and solvent used in the formulation, so there can be differences between brands of CHP. Predator 300 was sold in the 90s specifically as a lower phyto formulation, which used a narrow range paraffin oil.

People are digging videos of CBN where he abused Congress like anything... adding fuel to fire .. His Nickname U Turn Babu and. Bend Babu.. TDP is gone..
2126 2018-11-01 19:53:36 Mike Jordan still looks like he uses canola oil for eye drops for his contacts
2127 2018-11-01 19:53:34 My guess is because #2 has you pulling down your pants. I know someone whose pics were bounced because her skin was shiny from oil.
2128 2018-11-01 19:53:33 Hmm I remember "OH MY GOD THINGS ARE BAD"  We need to look in the mirror.  CUTS CUTS CUTS, we have a spending problem.  Oh forget about the 16 billion in oil royalties we forgot to collect.

2135 2018-11-01 19:52:59 Oil is getting crushed...
2136 2018-11-01 19:52:44 Steve’s tip of the day, if you get oil on your new carpet then a combination of bicarbonate of soda and WD40 will fix it. Genius.
2137 2018-11-01 19:52:37 Oil be darned!

2143 2018-11-01 19:51:47 Acupuncture, chiro, TCM etc all have their benefits - real and perceived. The problem is when they stray from their limited domains and try to supplant evidence based medicine for profit no less. Being sold on an evidence based drug looks bad, but it beats being sold on snake oil
2144 2018-11-01 19:51:43 Did you even watch that video.

Salmond prediction of how much oil revenue we would be getting was a full £8bn out.

What has Wales got to do with us?

You just repeat all SNP crib sheet.  We are lucky to be part of the UK.  We would be like Greece without the sun if we weren't!

2146 2018-11-01 19:51:30 Accidentally bought virgin coconut oil instead of refined and my scrambled eggs tasted like fluffy coconut earlier. That shit threw me off and put me in a mood 
2147 2018-11-01 19:51:14 Natural moroccan argan oil is the answer.
2148 2018-11-01 19:51:12 I will stop take oil from them it will change their mind in several month.
2149 2018-11-01 19:51:00 The current price of Heating Oil is $2.649 per gallon.
2150 2018-11-01 19:50:41 What does the definition of 100% certified mean in the context of palm oil?
2151 2018-11-01 19:50:34 The worst thing I am likely to do to this race is fund school projects, help those struggling with heating oil, provide resources for food insecurity, help small businesses get clients...seems like a win to me.
2152 2018-11-01 19:50:34 Does it, Larry?

Wasn't the same said about our diamond deposits? And before celebrating, look at Venezuela and what a basket case it is despite its considerable oil deposits.
2153 2018-11-01 19:50:33 Ghana  is not a major exporter of crude oil.. Get that into your skull  Mr #BUHARIST
2154 2018-11-01 19:50:29 very soon we will be having rebels in Zim. then comes the UN peace missions and the US army to search for weapons of mass destruction , Mnangagwa if he refuses the USA to take the oil, he becomes No.1 dictator in the world
2155 2018-11-01 19:50:29 I had jury duty, got an oil change, and am currently getting my drivers license renewed. I ain’t doing shit on Saturday but getting my hair done and getting my nails done. If I see one more waiting room I’m gonna go insane.
2156 2018-11-01 19:50:28 Hanzi kwaita OIL muzarabani ehh okey fine but lest we forget that we still need answers over MARANGE DIAMONDS.
2157 2018-11-01 19:50:01 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
2158 2018-11-01 19:49:55 My lips are so chapped I’m gonna put vegetable oil on them
2159 2018-11-01 19:49:39 My son's getting to age. Almost time for his first POS so that he can learn to bust knuckles and sweat oil.

I think its a right of passage, then we grow up and buy Toyotas.
2160 2018-11-01 19:49:38 Exactly.   Boot is nothing more than a snake oil salesman.  He’s only looking at $$$.   Never heard of him before Trump.
2161 2018-11-01 19:49:24 All thats needed for the removal of ZIDERA is the respect of our constitution, human rights free and 100% fair elections, not some oil from muzarabani
2162 2018-11-01 19:49:09 石油だってオリーブオイルだって変わらぬオイルだ。だからみんな、資源は大切に使おう。
2163 2018-11-01 19:49:06 We produce more oil than Iraq now lol
2164 2018-11-01 19:49:03 needs some beard oil to soften it.  
2165 2018-11-01 19:49:02 What he said is the truth. Governors are diff from central govt
Okonjo Iweala, a minister of the then central govt warned Governors but her warnings fell on deaf ears.
That said, oil prices have increased tremendously in the past couple of months, still nothing +ve from this govt

2167 2018-11-01 19:49:00 At bottom science is another 'story'. There is always the idea of oil in the ground before the search begins...
2168 2018-11-01 19:48:54 Been such a shit day. Slept terrible, dealt with bad vertigo this morning.. managed to feel good enough to go get some errands done.. go to park to see about an oil change and my car lurches forward after parking to hit the handicap sign enough to tip it and it smacks into the +

2170 2018-11-01 19:48:42 I’ve had my Mercedes for 5 years almost 6 and I love my car but the maintenance is getting way too hard for me to keep up with. Like gas and oil changes all that. Next year hopefully I get a new car, a more affordable one
2171 2018-11-01 19:48:33 it’s refreshing seeing CBD oil in pharmacies.
2172 2018-11-01 19:48:29 ...before we discover the oil and they claim it as theirs. Remember Africans discovered their own minerals and used them 'sparingly', they came to plunder.
2173 2018-11-01 19:48:21 And i got a lot of friends who be running out of oil too lol
2174 2018-11-01 19:48:20 I need an oil change, tire rotation, & probably a lot more done to my car .. I need somewhere good & not too pricey 
2175 2018-11-01 19:48:16 Hey @VW I just spent $4000 on my car!! How does a free oil change sound?? Thx
2176 2018-11-01 19:48:13 Oil worked out well for Syria
2177 2018-11-01 19:48:02 You’ll be saying it’s not Scotland’s oil next .. so you think the tories in WM ... and Labour in Wales are doing a wonderful job ... you’re beyond help I’m afraid
2178 2018-11-01 19:47:47 beard oil can’t save you
2179 2018-11-01 19:47:45 It varies by company but around here if you're on auto delivery and they let you run out, most companies will send a service van with a 5 gallon can of oil and purge the lines for free if you ask.
2180 2018-11-01 19:47:25 Mullahs have the power to make Mr Trump vomit the key out with their magic incantations lubricated with oil. Sanctions may have some effect as circumnavigating the whole issue is not a very difficult task. A good satirical cartoon.
2181 2018-11-01 19:47:24 I knew you would say that..oil was discovered long back jus lol

2184 2018-11-01 19:47:01 So, as an “exec of a Fortune 500 company,” you know there are literally thousands of reasons a business may need to restructure, or req. bankruptcy proceedings. In 2005, oil prices caused hundreds of thousands of businesses to file. What does that have to do with Ga Gov race?
2185 2018-11-01 19:47:00 oil fans, I am putting in an order early this month, please let me know what you would like...Christmas Spirit, help to boost immune, deal with family gatherings, experience more joy, ease or rest???
2186 2018-11-01 19:46:53 idk if i said that but cbd oil is literally the same as coconut oil. just oil from a plant.
2187 2018-11-01 19:46:52 Well, this time it's kinda routine maintenance? Brake pads are worn out as they do, oil change, air vent filter, and tag renewal
2188 2018-11-01 19:46:50 Gnut oil rice conc.
2189 2018-11-01 19:46:24 so i’m getting my oil changed, and the guy comes out, and he’s like “while i’m cleaning your windows, you want me to get rid of those horrific Giants stickers on the back?” 
2190 2018-11-01 19:46:20 God, people they dashed oil wells are mere mortals too. I'm not saying anything, I'm just thanking you for an amazing month.

2193 2018-11-01 19:46:09 Need to find a new scent in body oil form. I don't want mists or sprays. I need vanilla/warm scents. Why is this so hard?!?
2194 2018-11-01 19:46:05 I agree, but to what degree? Which also then brings into question how much Governments and big energy firms have held back technologies, because of how much money is made from oil. Bit rich to then tax and blame regular people.
2195 2018-11-01 19:46:03 While I agree that the combustion of fossil fuels in the atmosphere is harmful, how much more dangerous would it be to not extract oil and let microbes underground eat it making calderas and other places that hold or release methane? It’s a natural byproduct we take for granted.
2196 2018-11-01 19:45:52 Just ordered 500 litres of heating oil. I have no idea how much 500 litres is, just hoping it fits in that tank out the back... (as it's the smallest amount you can order I'm assuming so...)

2201 2018-11-01 19:45:18 Lmao nah I learned my lesson one good time. I will never go without an oil change
2202 2018-11-01 19:45:12 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
2203 2018-11-01 19:45:06 I made some excellent pesto with a bag of almost-off spinach, mixed seeds, a rock hard nubbin of Parmesan and some olive oil. Thanks to @BootstrapCook for the inspiration.

2205 2018-11-01 19:44:59 I think his sister is involved in ranching. Yes, he is profiting from private ranchers, oil and he's got an ownership % in Protect the Harvest who want to allow slaughter and consumption of horse meat in the US. At their profit, of course. Tucker Carlson knows about that.

2210 2018-11-01 19:43:52 Many companies think theyre buying sustainable palm oil when they buy from RSPO, but the RSPO is actually certifying forest destruction. The RSPOs current standards leave its members free to destroy forests. I call bull ****

2212 2018-11-01 19:43:50 lol, quit lying. When peak oil demand is reached and starts to decline the prices will drop.

2217 2018-11-01 19:43:39 ordered some spike oil to try to use as solvent for oil painting. I can't deal with the smell of mineral spirits or and turpentine is really not usable in the winter here I don't think.

2219 2018-11-01 19:43:21 Repetition is propaganda.  He could have denounced it, stated he won’t link to it, and let people rely on his word as a Senator or media or go see themselves if so inclined.  By linking, he made it more likely not less people would see it.  False opposition basically.

2221 2018-11-01 19:43:10 Get someone to combine. Japanese Mint Oil and coconut oil- then to give you a gentle massage. 

Stay away from stairs, they’re always up to something.
2222 2018-11-01 19:43:04 I tell you, all that veg oil is shit and dangerous. It burns all the pans and makes you eat that carbon causing cancers. I now use some good bacon fat, nothing sticks or burns just browns off nice.

2227 2018-11-01 19:42:25 This is what happens when we sell our oil for dirt cheap then turn around and buy it back from the states over market value.

2352 2018-11-01 19:28:02 It’s been made abundantly clear that we can’t rely on the oil industry to tell us the truth. Profits matter more to you than the fate of the planet.

2354 2018-11-01 19:27:52 naaa that’s not how it works. They befriend you, talk nice to you, boost you and are generally genuine (because of what they need of course).
Also the Brits will get that oil. But yea America will try China might even get in before anyone else,but that’s just a guess.
2355 2018-11-01 19:27:51 Be sure & read the new quarterly report from @Go_Rozen. I believe this little take down in oil lays down the Red Carpet for the run  to $100.
2356 2018-11-01 19:27:50 That's awful.What a complicated situation you've got for moving oil. I'm in England  & I'm not sure how we move Brent Crude, I think most of it's exported.
2357 2018-11-01 19:27:48 #India didn't ask for a weiver from #USA, Americans did it to save their own faces. #India has already ordered massive Oil shipments from #Iran for November-December i.e. Post sanction period.
2358 2018-11-01 19:27:46 @RachelNotley Its time to stop selling your oil at 18 a barrel demand 40 or shut off the taps.

2362 2018-11-01 19:27:12 Duh, MBS, or Saudi leaders in general, are puppets of Israel and the US. They got the Saudi leadership by the balls. Especially when the Saudi oil runs out, then the Saudis even won't have a serious leverage anymore.
2363 2018-11-01 19:26:53 End result of advertising how great Texas is, more people moving here from high tax, high regulation states and voting the exact same way they did to destroy the state they fled.
2364 2018-11-01 19:26:49 Who do I want to burn in hell 1st.. Moro or Bolsonaro? I think judge #Moro. He hatched the egg planted by the americans who were after our valuable Presalt OIL. It all started back then w/ NSA spying on PETROBRAS, the rest is history - now our Presalt n Democracy are History..
2365 2018-11-01 19:26:38 Mine takes synthetic too and its wild because I called other Mini places and their oil change was still more expensive than the dealership. I’d feel like I’m getting ripped off if I knew they didn’t take 100% responsibility for everything lol
2366 2018-11-01 19:26:36 And the local partner in this oil project is........???
2367 2018-11-01 19:26:36 Oh but they allow oil barons  like the Kochs to decide for them.

2372 2018-11-01 19:26:11 This is why I despair Ali. And then theres the Capitalists. Try crowbaring them off their oil rigs and their mines. And the flat-earthers. What chance we got?
2373 2018-11-01 19:26:04 Sardines in olive oil, fresh lime, garlic and spices...mash it up...just with crackers...SO GOOD!  Don't get that cheap ass sardine can.  @DrewOnTheRadio @SethKush @TheJohnSenning
2374 2018-11-01 19:26:02 The Venezuelan oil industry is as ilegal as the gold industry for it is used to support drug cartels, terrorist guerrilla, killing Venezuelan citizens and money laundering. This criminal regime will end when the US impose a total embargo on Maduro’s dictatorship

2378 2018-11-01 19:25:31 And we are not unfamiliar with international legal pursuits, Iraq cracked down on illegal sale of KRG oil very harshly and took down several sales to western countries, most memorable is Canada. Legal frameworks exist for a reason.
2379 2018-11-01 19:25:21 “Remittances are one of Mexico's top sources of foreign income, outpacing oil exports, which totaled $18.5 billion”. That means we spend billions on illegals here in the US, and then the money they make here is sent back to Mexico. 

That is why MEXICO does not want it to stop

2389 2018-11-01 19:24:21 The reality is that the oil patch will never be properly cleaned up and this has been probably been the plan all along. Clean up costs most likely make many fossil fuel projects uneconomic. And we all have a pretty good idea who will pick up the tab for most of it anyways.

They are cooked in vegetable oil, so can only be mutant potatoes?
2393 2018-11-01 19:23:38 Young man have you bought anointing oil??
2394 2018-11-01 19:23:37 I agree. I don't like olives or advacado but use olive oil and local rape seed oil too. Honey isn't vegan so I don't eat or use that.

Oil also burns becomin cancerous

2408 2018-11-01 19:21:14 Fed/Treasury HFT strategy during a crisis is to take down oil. It's a way they provide stimulus without losing face by turning to QE.

2419 2018-11-01 19:20:15 Yup, was going thru this earlier today... unusually large gap now.

Smart money pumped oil by 20-25 $ on newsflow & dumped. Equities is the only game in town with what’s happening to metals, bonds, commodities. Gives a melt up phase feeling but investors still in denial.

2447 2018-11-01 19:18:17 You clearly don't know western forces. ask every other country which has oil and refused to give it or tried "reasonable" price negotiations. Iran , Russia , Venezuela , Egypt , Libya, Iraq.
2448 2018-11-01 19:18:09 This is a wise idea and I hv a proposal for non oil sector.
2449 2018-11-01 19:17:59 The amount of animal products per person has risen during that time. Cholesterol is only in animal products and when your body produces all you need why consume it through diet?

2452 2018-11-01 19:17:39 if price of crude oil  has drop, it is only logical that the prices of it by-product such as petrol and kerosine etc also drop but hell no the reverse is the case. only  in buhari administration that the price of a product is inversely proportional to it by-product.

2468 2018-11-01 19:15:52 Just as he left us an almost empty treasury and a flat economy. Remember when he was leaving, crude oil was 25 dollars per barrel.
2469 2018-11-01 19:15:49 Which is why it's crucial to: 1) get that oil to market while it still holds value 2) harness revenues/royalties appropriately to cover those costs... if only conservatives understood that, 40yrs worth of royalties won't have been flushed down the drain... #abpoli

2472 2018-11-01 19:15:43 If you get your CBD oil from any state but those two then there will be no natural terpenes, unless it’s something recreational, which I would avoid. But there is a huge difference. You don’t need more than 500mg CBD oil, as long as you have natural terpenes you will notice

2483 2018-11-01 19:14:44 Agreed. Also with automation & technology advancements we don’t need “workers” like we used to. Most of the retail and restaurant jobs will be gone, manufacturing is gone to China (and now US with Trump), Justin wants to get rid of workers in oil fields... so where do they work?

2488 2018-11-01 19:14:11 Coincidentally, of course, Turkey just announced they were going to start exploring and drilling in their portion of the Cyprus oil fields which Cyprus also claims jurisdiction over.
2489 2018-11-01 19:14:08 Did you know that the smoke point of any cooking oil is important? Smoke point is when the oil turns into smoke. For example, flaxseed oil has a low smoke point, so it is best not to use it on high heat because there would be lots of smoke. I see this happen all the time.
2490 2018-11-01 19:14:07 Y el dolar sigue bajando pero los combustibles (nafta  gas oil) siguen igual cuando subía el dolar temsrcaban enseguida ahora se hacen los distraídos  como en todo lo demás también.
2491 2018-11-01 19:14:05 These men don't know how to fight, change oil or nothing...they just do drugs and cry
2492 2018-11-01 19:14:00 On the day that we learn that their are billions of dollars in unfunded public liability from the AB oil industry, Rafi Tahmazian is on BNN complaining about the excess of regulation. Catherine Murray just nods. @BNNBloomberg #cdnpoli #abpoli
2493 2018-11-01 19:13:59 Oil of Olay and Vaseline; no heating which should give clearer skin but just gives you a runny nose.....
2494 2018-11-01 19:13:55 Is oil cheap to extract
2495 2018-11-01 19:13:51 Are there chemicals in cooking oil?
2496 2018-11-01 19:13:42 @AmbJohnBolton Most probably the  Iranian oil shall be smuggled from Joint oil fields , prime is Ammar Alhakim عمار الحكيم  , manufacturing 400 tanks to be fitted on truks  only in one huge factory in ERBIL  do not tellme  Barzani do ot know< PM abdul mahdi < oil Minister  ,
2497 2018-11-01 19:13:37 Why is CBD oil illegal ?
Why is CBD oil illegal ?
2498 2018-11-01 19:13:36 the flaxseed & castor oil one is fire
2499 2018-11-01 19:13:34 Good move. Thank you. Let's get off oil.
2500 2018-11-01 19:13:25 Learned this today. In Texas (and probably other states too) the possession of cannabis concentrate (oil, wax, etc) is a class B felony. You know what else is a class B felony? Manslaughter, reckless homicide, kidnapping, aggravated sexual assault. Anyone else see a problem??!
2501 2018-11-01 19:13:25 That’s crazy females really don’t be getting oil changes 
2502 2018-11-01 19:13:14 UK military working with gov politicians MSM BBC to support terrorists like they are in Syria. Killing Syrian women children and SAA, helping to loot oil in Syria Libya - Houthis were fighting ISIS terrorists in Yemen then UK US started killing the people fighting the terrorists
2503 2018-11-01 19:13:04 You need to shape them, push cuticles back and lightly buff them. I also wash my hands before application with dish soap to remove any oil from the nail. I put the wrap cold on my nail, heat each side of the nail and use a rubber tipped cuticle pusher to press the wrap down.
2504 2018-11-01 19:12:57 Hahah seriously we can’t have oil discovery and hiv cure munyika one in a space of 5days
2505 2018-11-01 19:12:52 Two race-baiting snake oil salesmen in the same room, you might even get 500 people in the room oblivious enough to buy what you're selling!
2506 2018-11-01 19:12:52 Car doctor Noodle needs her oil changed o:
2507 2018-11-01 19:12:50 Oil chafu
2508 2018-11-01 19:12:47 Nigeria wants to sell the cheapest petrol in the world. Neither the highest producer of crude oil nor petrol.

2511 2018-11-01 19:12:40 Pls show us d pricing template as worked out; who are the top international players in oil and gas industry involved. All these missive we have heard it before. If you people are serious, put your plans on paper for scrutiny. useless promises won't work this time.
2512 2018-11-01 19:12:38 Waiting in a 1h line to see a room flooded with engine oil in an art gallery. As you do.
2513 2018-11-01 19:12:37 A meal in 5 minutes! Seitan steak baked with bacon mince and olive oil.
2514 2018-11-01 19:12:28 The US dollar fell sharply amid improved risk sentiment and reports of a Brexit deal. US equities continued to recover from October’s rout, the S&P500’s 0.7% gain perhaps helped by indications of a thaw in US-China relations. Oil fell 2% on rising supply.
2515 2018-11-01 19:12:17 Everyone talks about girls not getting their oil changed. Just wait until you buy your own car, I’m the most paranoid person about my oil now. I won’t even go 50 miles over 
2516 2018-11-01 19:12:07 It's lack of education, which R's are making much worse. You look at Kansas or Oklahoma, they've cut taxes so much, they can't even keep schools running smoothly. In Oklahoma, they outsourced school education supplies to oil companies. I've seen propoganda kids books for big oil.
2517 2018-11-01 19:12:04 Good clean, drop of h2o 1st coat followed by 2 neat coats. Dries quick & was hard non marking after about a week. Other than special spray ap or oil I’d use it again for sure 
2518 2018-11-01 19:12:03 Quick! Someone tell the United States that there is oil in Yemen.
2519 2018-11-01 19:12:02 @TeamYouTube Why is my YouTube Premium showing me ads for oil companies? Actually, why is it showing me ads AT ALL when in paying for ad-free service???
2520 2018-11-01 19:12:01 Or the baby oil
2521 2018-11-01 19:11:59 Oil dey their head jor. 
We played football,basketball with dustbin,and hot Eba in my class back then. @ItsNeverBlank @OmotiJojo @CYPHER1708
2522 2018-11-01 19:11:54 Because the planet's interests are more important then the fossil fuel industries interests.

And what is in Alberta's best interest is to nationalize this finite resource and maximize the value by refining and upgrading here and supplying Canada short term while we get off oil.
2523 2018-11-01 19:11:26 Hydrogen cars are the future, clean with just water as waste. But, business and the oil cartels  will not promote, and neither will the Government because there is no money to be made.
2524 2018-11-01 19:11:20 so today... i made breakfast, paid all my bills, talked to financial aid, went to the irs, went to the bank, got gas, and an oil change all before lunch

2526 2018-11-01 19:11:15 @LaBeautyologist I’m thouroughly impressed with the 60 seconds rule. My facial brush and coconut oil are catching dust now. 
2527 2018-11-01 19:11:14 Oil supply tightened to 1.989 bln lbs from 2.215 bln in Aug. Meal stocks ballooned 499 tmt from 360 tmt in Aug which is the highest stocks number going back in my data for three years, at least.
2528 2018-11-01 19:11:13 Ah ha moment #1 - our resource industries are deeply connected....limestone gravel for oil sands roads, humalite for soils, potash for agriculture, coal for carbon fiber technology.....

2530 2018-11-01 19:11:02 It has already been dropped from headlines in US and replaced by other issues.
And looks like Iran Sanctions will take place next week with little adverse effects on oil prices.

2535 2018-11-01 19:10:25 "I moved from 1 oil Co. to another had private medical to give urine specimen for pregnancy questioned this told Co. wouldn't fund management training unless females took test had 10 yrs management experience another Co. so no training requirements still had to have test"

2539 2018-11-01 19:10:15 My wife swears by CBD oil... says that it really helps her sleep and upon awakening her migraine is gone.
2540 2018-11-01 19:10:05 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
2541 2018-11-01 19:10:01 Berkesan la jugak. Tapi agak oily (fyi i’ve oily skin) & ada mineral oil (patch test dulu kot2 alah).
2542 2018-11-01 19:09:42 What is the formation of oil if we are landlocked and where are deposits coming from
2543 2018-11-01 19:09:39 I'm sure you're a lovely woman, but this is straight BS...... anyone with half a brain would never fall for this snake oil salesmen.  No disrespect to the Rabbi, but not buying any of it
2544 2018-11-01 19:09:35 How much oil lol 
2545 2018-11-01 19:09:33 @AmbJohnBolton try to  convince me , what i see is opposite what you say , Minister of oil in Iraq , prime Minister < kurdish gov. know very well that  oil  is smuggled , 400 tanks is manufactured now in ERBIL ( call me , show you 009647503807030).
2546 2018-11-01 19:09:24 I’m sure they’re happy that Germany is cancelling billions in gas sales from them. I’m also sure they’re happy we are ramping up oil and coal output, which is their main revenue source. Add to this a US air strike that killed hundreds of Russians. Whatever.
2547 2018-11-01 19:09:12 Castrol oil will do wonders ! I wore eyelash extensions and then after came across castrol oil and my lashes grew back so fast
2548 2018-11-01 19:09:04 Damn I’m glad my boss leaving this week. Free oil change and alignment Yessa lol
2549 2018-11-01 19:08:59 Read it in article. Grandpa made a fortune in the oil business, passed it on to pet, who in turn willed it mommy,brother and jt. Who couldn’t use the foundation until he reached the age of 45.
Google Justin Trudeau foundation, read the NP article. Blow your mind mind.
2550 2018-11-01 19:08:59 been needing an oil change for weeks now 
2551 2018-11-01 19:08:39 Mr Bhushan

If before to that after do we need to take bath and what time to what time 
Also check tell us when we need to buy our crackers and between what time to what time 
Pls help us man confused with law
2552 2018-11-01 19:08:18 You can get CBD oil without THC and it is a hell of a lot less expensive.
I googled Epidiolex and it has a TON of warnings!!!
As you said - WTF????
2553 2018-11-01 19:08:01 Oil Near 7-Month Lows, Giving Trump Low Price Wish for Elections
2554 2018-11-01 19:07:58 - His hands slowly began to roam his chest a bit more, massaging the crevice between his jugs and then moving to the underboob area to lift them up and lather them in the shiny oil from underneath.

That obviously made his tits look even bigger, prompting the king to lick his -
2555 2018-11-01 19:07:56 I think what we're actually looking for is FUCKING SHAMELESS, that's how you describe 'judge' #Moro and his perverted brand of justice. All backed by the US:  Foreign co's got the OIL, fascists got back into power. What a sweet deal, everyone's a Winner!  NO, wait..
2556 2018-11-01 19:07:51 Not gonna put oil in the flame but how the hell some people put RA in Muawiyya's as well as in Ahle Bait's name 

Like how possibly you could use same adjectives for Rasool ka gharana and for the person who massacred them? Discuss
2557 2018-11-01 19:07:44 Yeah.....Looking at KRE weekly....held at the 2017! Lows.   Troubling that much weakness.  Oil also troubling....gone too far
2558 2018-11-01 19:07:15 Yes, it does...and I was reminiscing about the past. I don't even the last time I had any chips and salt and vinegar doesn't taste the same as it did back in the 90s. I think they changed the oil. And I just finished eating popcorn, relish, and ketchup not too long ago
2559 2018-11-01 19:07:14 THE EARTH IS FUCKING DEAD
*Insert oil companies doing the crab rave*
2560 2018-11-01 19:07:13 If you are still greasing your scalp with hair grease...

STOP  

Let your scalp breathe. Your scalp creates its own owns identified as sebum. 

Most hair grease contain mineral oil & petroleum.  These clogs pores. As if you had a plastic cap over your head. 

Use #kumanimist
2561 2018-11-01 19:07:05 Listened to an interview with you by a socialist today. first oil and gas are not fossil, they are mineral products. And Co2 is the gas of life. Without it all plants and animals will die. When you raise the Co2 level  the temperature will drop, not raise as they faulty claims.
2562 2018-11-01 19:07:04 By the time the oil extracted i hope all the Zanu Pf maggots would have kicked the bucket!They are a curse to the Citizens of Zimbabwe!!
2563 2018-11-01 19:06:54 Yet oil prices are still high.... and most of the top 10 Fortune 500 companies are energy companies.....
2564 2018-11-01 19:06:53 @karaswisher , please don't offer him weed or anything to make him look bad, you know the shorts and media, and oil companies are all watching to see what bad things they can get out of him. Thanks.
2565 2018-11-01 19:06:53 @AmbJohnBolton you want to  see by yourself how senior shiaat politicians  preparing  ( Ammar  Al- Ahakim عمار الحكيم ) is preparing hugefleet of  tanker - trucks to smuggle Iranian oil via Iraq ( in ERBIL 400 tanks is manufactured now  , dead line  51 days  ,more all around Iraq
2566 2018-11-01 19:06:52 One of the guys changing the oil in my car can like... get it
2567 2018-11-01 19:06:49 Look at his "Oil boy" in the background. How does your life reach that point? Look into his eyes. Pure emptiness. Hes given up.......
2568 2018-11-01 19:06:40 Nezuro yaive HIV cure nhasi hanz Oil discovery. Zimbabwe haisi yakungotsvagawo relevance here iyi
2569 2018-11-01 19:06:28 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
2570 2018-11-01 19:06:28 So where’s my oil lease check?
2571 2018-11-01 19:06:26 #ZIMBABWE got oil now
We too blessed to be stressed but somehow we are always stressed
2572 2018-11-01 19:06:22 My ears are the one thing that are sort of okay. But the whole house reeks of Olbas Oil.
2573 2018-11-01 19:06:21 US oil prices are sharply lower today, down more than -US$2.50/bbl and  now just over US$63.50/bbl. The Brent benchmark prices are just under  US$73/bbl. Rising supply and falling economic growth are factors pushing  the price lower.
2574 2018-11-01 19:06:13 I wish that the money out of this Oil channeled to economic developments.. last time we had diamond we lost US$15 B.. yet out countries budget is 5 Billion..
2575 2018-11-01 19:06:10 Sanctions and war, they have migrants to shoot now so the war machine will continue to work well. 

USA is oil independent so they need a new war to fight.
2576 2018-11-01 19:06:04 @AsoRock please who are those in charge of Badagry express way (Alakija to Iyana-oba and beyond..), and what are their plans for humanity?
Is it until we discover crude oil before they know that these portholes are due for legit filling?
2577 2018-11-01 19:05:57 The seeds were from my first ever plant, grown this summer. The scent from the flowers and the straw are far gentler and more floral than the essential oil. A happier scent. 
2578 2018-11-01 19:05:57 It's has to be a different dept as there are no skills available for oil so there will be need to train up people in the field and can be part of contract with companies dealing with the work.
2579 2018-11-01 19:05:52 Why did they sell their rights to the Spanish when they started servicing the oil rigs instead of carrying on fishing ?
2580 2018-11-01 19:05:49 Lmao an oil change
2581 2018-11-01 19:05:24 Oil discovery = some people increasingly getting extremely wealthy
2582 2018-11-01 19:05:09 @theplantelife @MoniquaPlante do u have a favorite brand of essential oil? I was looking to boost my immunity /gargle with oregano.
2583 2018-11-01 19:05:06 RTRS: BRAZIL EXPORTS 6.85 MLN T CRUDE OIL IN OCTOBER VS 5.90 MLN T IN SEPTEMBER AND 3.80 MLN T YR AGO - TRADE MINISTRY - Impressive jump in Brazil's crude exports while local demand for refined remain low #Brazil #crude #exports
2584 2018-11-01 19:04:55 Has anyone ever had any cough medicine that has worked. Ever. No. You haven't have you. See. It's all snake oil. Damn you, pharmaceutical companies and damn you, cough.
2585 2018-11-01 19:04:52 There's three things in life a person should always know how to change: 

change your own oil, 
change your tires, 
and change your shitty attitude.
2586 2018-11-01 19:04:51 I agree with you on framework, there need to be a different framework governing oil and gas (including Lupane). These projects usually capital intensive running into billions and I think there needs to a different dept dealing with it even within geological survey.
2587 2018-11-01 19:04:47 This is the 12-month MA of YoY % changes of PPI. So, there's a lag until this'll show up in the chart anyway. Plus, YoY even in Oct and Nov Oil is up and as far as data for Greek Manufacturing production index is concerned, the latest print is for Aug. So, it's too early for the>
2588 2018-11-01 19:04:32 Btw Hair needing moisture is water. Oil won’t give your hair moisture. Please note. Water Base moisturiser will do you good. Use oil in small amounts.
2589 2018-11-01 19:04:24 Must be a Trump supporter.. why wouldn't you want solar whether it's beside me or down the road? Better than fuel, oil or coal wth?
2590 2018-11-01 19:04:22 Lol It's mainly due to sharp devaluation of Pak Ruppee against green back, wherein the US$/PKR parity depriciated more than 22% since december 2017 and curently strikes at around Rs.132..In addition to this, a rise in oil prices was also observed in same period.
2591 2018-11-01 19:04:20 Simpleton. Ordinarily I wouldn’t say such a thing but I have good reasons to tonight. Economics is more like moving an oil tanker than riding a scooter about. Winds, currents, tides, not point and go. How is a graph with 39M of data a soundbite lacking context? Think harder pls
2592 2018-11-01 19:04:19 Laney you are filthy and look like a recovering crackhead them feet look like you just walked a mile on hot rocks that face filled liver splash with no makeup or filter you have to keep that skin oil at all times that hair brittle af bitch show that hair under that wig
2593 2018-11-01 19:04:08 Bihari’s love their mustard oil as well. Some use it like cosmetics.
2594 2018-11-01 19:04:06 @muradagtfoods Super news about the Churchill port. Congratulations. I have advocated for its greater use as a grain port and more particularly oil. Why not a pipeline to Churchill? Why not oil by rail to Churchill? An Ottawa report in 1920s bragged about its potential.
2595 2018-11-01 19:04:01 Oil
2596 2018-11-01 19:04:01 Bah everyone but olive oil so idk what mix you’re talking about
2597 2018-11-01 19:03:59 Oil
2598 2018-11-01 19:03:53 Kemp is a snake oil salesman. A carpetbagger of the first order. The day we save America will be the day that every day, working-class people fill our Senate and House seats. Not cheats like Kemp. #Resist and #VoteBlue.
2599 2018-11-01 19:03:52 Secondly, as of the end of 2019 we would've collected over 55m litres of Used Cooking Oil which would've otherwise been dumped in the sea, causing environmental damage. Instead we utilize this waste and power our cryptocurrency mine. 
2600 2018-11-01 19:03:42 Imagine oil discovered in  your yard as a Black man. Yho!
2601 2018-11-01 19:03:36 Wait....girls really don’t get oil changes?
2602 2018-11-01 19:03:36 Apparently they found oil in Zimbabwe. That's amazing news, I'm happy or my country.
2603 2018-11-01 19:03:24 Unlikely looking at that graph. Crude oil prices better explain trend shown in Wellington and Canterbury. Auckland disconnected from crude oil price drop.
2604 2018-11-01 19:03:14 I have the greatest man in my life! First he got my oil changed, then did the laundry and now is cleaning my car 
2605 2018-11-01 19:03:14 U.S. oil benchmark settles below $64 to post lowest finish since April
2606 2018-11-01 19:03:09 .President ED announces oil discovery, reports ZBC Online
.the new resource is forecast to highly significant quantities of tight oil & gas which once extraction begins, then, Zim citizens will be raised up of the poverty datum daily experience of quagmire to admirable status quo
2607 2018-11-01 19:02:57 So can I fry potatoes with coconut oil?
2608 2018-11-01 19:02:53 Its fancy snake oil
2609 2018-11-01 19:02:47 Lmao Flat Earth people telling me my friends in Australia are actors and it does not exist...LOL I can't with every jackass conspiracy theory that goes around to begin with...but this one..damn! As for Lizard people..when my auntie looks like one...we dip her in olive oil LOL
2610 2018-11-01 19:02:26 from Queen Bee to HIV cure, now Oil discovery all within a week. Zim issa full drama, paraffin! What's the guess for next week.....? @matigary @Wamagaisa @zimleague @ShadayaTawona25 @OpenParlyZw @Mathuthu
2611 2018-11-01 19:02:26 Only thing I’m missing is the oil change FOH 
2612 2018-11-01 19:02:23 We have over 975 people being forced against their will in @broomfield alone. This fight not only hasn’t been fair, it’s costing taxpayers millions of dollars. $1.8 million for air quality monitoring and we are getting $20,000 from Extraction oil and gas.  One example.
2613 2018-11-01 19:02:22 The United States is poised to grant waivers to India and South Korea that will allow the countries to continue buying oil from Iran, (1/2)
2614 2018-11-01 19:02:10 It’ll cost more to transport that what the oil is worth.
2615 2018-11-01 19:02:06 your sanctions  against  Iran is bullshit > Ammar Al- Hakim is preparing 2000 tankers - trucks  to smuggle Iranian oil via iraq , at least 400 manufactured in ERBIL , delivery dead line 51 days , more mobile  tanks  manufactured all around Iraq .
2616 2018-11-01 19:02:03 You have no clue what you want to achieve in Syria. SDF backed by you are being humiliated in Deir Ezzor but you're patrolling Manbij with the same country that facilitated movement of jihadists into Syria, then enriched them by buying oil illegally extracted from Syria & Iraq
2617 2018-11-01 19:02:02 I like olive oil in my soap and sometimes hair

2623 2018-11-01 19:01:16 SCIF or SCIN or SMIM. Small caps, beaten plus tend to outperform when oil down and rupee up.
2624 2018-11-01 19:01:13 Algeria's energy potential is in the order of 4000 billion tonnes of oil equivalent of proved reserves, 2/3 of which is gas and 1.5 million square kilometres of mining area of which 2/3 is not yet exploited.
2625 2018-11-01 19:01:11 Gold is up 20.00 today. Some folks might be getting worried. With Oil down again  I am thinking at this point much more downside to come. We are at the 18 SMA  on a lot of indexes A rejection from here and they better have a parachute for their longs.
2626 2018-11-01 19:01:02 my oil is definitely changed

2642 2018-11-01 19:00:05 That’s why each nation has a right to defend itself. If the South becomes a nation we can form alliances with other nations. Bloody hell we have the oil

Ooh, clary sage. A powerful beast - I find the essential oil very hard to work with because it sends my brain to pieces really quickly! That'll be a beautiful cluster of plants 
2654 2018-11-01 18:58:31 I'll never understand why synthol freaks think ballooning your muscles to comic proportions with squishy oil makes them look good.

2658 2018-11-01 18:58:04 try argan oil
2659 2018-11-01 18:57:55 WE arm our own enemies. Until now the only country that has funded a direct attack on US soil (9/11) has been Saudi Arabia and will sell out dignity(and weapons) to them for oil
2660 2018-11-01 18:57:52 MY HEART IS SO FULL RN.

.needs detailed analysis of the find's content, size & extraction viability
2662 2018-11-01 18:57:41 next week with officials from Jefferson County and the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission that will provide more information. Westminster will always work to preserve and protect Standley Lake, which serves as a water supply for 300,000 people in the area.

2670 2018-11-01 18:56:45 well, with regs on oil and gas industries (including industries that use oil and gas - automotive most notably) is very quickly speeding up climate change. 2100 is a fine estimate I'm sure now, but we create more co2 every day.
2671 2018-11-01 18:56:41 Not the point. They got me in for stuff I have to pay for in days. Oil change and rotation. But are only allowed to do 1 #recall per day. Profits over safety. #ford
2672 2018-11-01 18:56:39 if you need new schools and hospitals, why don't you raise royalties on existing production? seems like something you could do all on your own - it's not like oil sands operations are going to pack up and leave...

and if Asian customers are the goal, why not sell to them today?
2673 2018-11-01 18:56:38 oil paint? adults really should be doing the painting #childLaborLaws
2674 2018-11-01 18:56:36 Saudi Arabia does not need anyone, it is rich in resources and its strong economy is the leader of the Islamic world, and has the largest oil in the world and the largest oil reserves in the world and is the main source of oil in the world, how the world does not need the Saudi?
2675 2018-11-01 18:56:33 Wow the ignorance of you. 

People would choose the train, as it’s one of the major forms of transportation there. Not only can it bring in oil, but also food, clothes, building supplies etc. etc. I guess you don’t care about any of those and only about oil.
2676 2018-11-01 18:56:30 Lol Im joking. I got my annual oil change 2 weeks ago. Im good.

2680 2018-11-01 18:56:08 I’m not here for a genders study class. There’s women and men. Simple. Gender neutral can kiss my red blooded American ass. I was calling bullshit in there statement. Just like any other person in this country they can come to oil fields and work just like

2688 2018-11-01 18:55:39 Whatever that happened in a relationship a Man is not supposed to beat a woman. Beat or no beat she’s not gonna respect or correct her mistakes
2689 2018-11-01 18:55:31 Lol It's mainly due to sharp devaluation of Pak Ruppee against green back, wherein the US$/PKR parity depriciated more than 23% since december 2017 and curently strikes at around Rs.132..In addition to this, a rise in oil prices was also observed in same period.
2690 2018-11-01 18:55:09 All the proceeds of the oil will go to rich Zimbabweans and international countries. The average citizen wont benefit. Either the Americans or the chinese will take over that country.
2691 2018-11-01 18:55:03 Btw should mention it's the essential oil.
2692 2018-11-01 18:54:58 There is no more agency that protects the environment. Pruitt was so corrupt. He was in large oil, etc companies pocket as he was in Oklahoma. Where he sued the EPA. It like this president put in people who’d wreck government agencies instead of protecting Citizens n America!
2693 2018-11-01 18:54:27 it has been a great day Pokerock with so many rises. That's why i'm going to treat myself to a nice cuppa tea and an episode of Auf Wiedersehen Pet....there are some damm good actors in there.

2699 2018-11-01 18:53:55 Well monopolizing all resources is not really possible... unless you're the government...

However monopolies on one industry is very rare in free markets, as it's almost impossible to get 100% control over oil for example.
2700 2018-11-01 18:53:53 I told you to drizzle it with olive oil, grill it and have it with some balsamic vinegar. Or grate it raw and have it with your greens. If you still hate it then I will leave you alone. Stop having it boiled dude!

2705 2018-11-01 18:53:43 Forget the money...an awful lot of people work in oil and gas and are concerned.
2706 2018-11-01 18:53:32 I want my hair done so bad but I also need a oil change 
2707 2018-11-01 18:53:20 “I think we went from being too worried about losing Iranian oil to now being too complacent,”   Wrong again. you were not realistic on Iranians. they created OPEC and have a good grasp of the local politics. A signature on a paper will not stop 70 million people to export oil.
2708 2018-11-01 18:53:17 All comparable downturns were reversed in 1-2 years. He had 8 to fix it and it still didn't resolve under him. He went to great lengths to wreck energy (killed coal, stifled oil), raise transport costs (cash for clunkers), pushed "America isn't special" policy, >regulations, etc.

2718 2018-11-01 18:52:19 We have a lot of jobs unfilled, dimms say.
These people are woefully unqualified for vast majority.  
We saw what happened when Mexico denied entry. An indication of the lengths they will go to in order to get what they need or want.
2719 2018-11-01 18:52:09 2. There are issues to do with the grade of oil, which determines cost of getting it out of the ground.  Some grades cannot be moved easily by pipeline due to viscosity. It’s a complex mineral, commercial viability is not guaranteed

Vote - it gets rid of crap and prevents future problems
2732 2018-11-01 18:50:47 Oil is still leaking into the gulf and no one is doing anything about it. If oil companies want to stop being treated as the bad guy, maybe they should clean up their messes and do research into alternative energy.
2733 2018-11-01 18:50:45 Incompatible. Oil and water.
2734 2018-11-01 18:50:42 Sulfate and paraben free shampoos and conditioners (regular shampoo strips your hair of moisture and weakens the hair shaft which promotes hair loss) Hair, skin, and nail vitamins. Increase water intake. Massage scalp with any hair oil for 3-5 minutes a day to stimulate growth.
2735 2018-11-01 18:50:38 Oil yes... but what happened to the gas
discoveries in Lupane as well as Jatropha Diesel ???
2736 2018-11-01 18:50:32 They can just make (illegal) drugs/arms trafficking their official trade. No more wars to front it.

All the oil rich countries they've invaded only generate income for 4 or 5 corporations anyway.  The country itself doesnt benefit.

...Like i said im ready for a new world order

2747 2018-11-01 18:49:37 Wow...maybe because the distance to the markets of Asia is massive $$$ blockade. Cost of barrel delivered would make it most expensive oil on the planet. Look at saving gas industry is looking at by locating in Kitimat BC.

2754 2018-11-01 18:49:03 Now recognize ALL the oil wars are about hucksters! Why do you only stand up now?
2755 2018-11-01 18:48:59 Its like a soft, almost gelatinous form of tofu - we had it in a chili oil and some veg it was I have found my new fave Chinese restaurant now
2756 2018-11-01 18:48:47 $19/bbl Canadian oil prices and NOT A SINGLE WORD out of Ottawa. #YYC #YEG #ableg #Cdnpoli #cdnecon
2757 2018-11-01 18:48:44 @NitishKumar 
About it we have to totally depend on god and if water do not come on time farmer live depend on diseal oil for they irrigate crop by machine ,they waste too much diseal oil for giving life for crop water
Irrigation facility is not good in bihar we are very far.
2758 2018-11-01 18:48:40 Came in for an oil change found out my whole brake system is fucked up
2759 2018-11-01 18:48:31 Tell em to FO.
Indian state owned refiners and marketing co should continue buying crude from cheapest source. No issue if sanctioned, they have almost negligible exposure to US financial system.
Though this move will damage bada Reliance's oil refinery and marketing business.

2763 2018-11-01 18:48:14 Ugh! Used to feel that way about seeing the fuel oil truck! Converted to natural gas 11 years ago. Cost less and much cleaner.
2764 2018-11-01 18:48:14 CT is a mess all round, just saw your xhv bottom call // alone is worth 5x the followers you have now. I mightn’t be the best trader but I do well like, getting better. Then the false prophets shilling bullshit, 90% shit calls, dealing kilos of hopium and snake oil with 20k+ fol.
2765 2018-11-01 18:48:06 More questionnaires in today! Thanks @dunnesports and @TVSathletics! @TAPPSbiz @spcsports @TxHS_Baseball. Happy to burn the midnight oil tonight if necessary. Keep ‘em coming!
2766 2018-11-01 18:47:55 1. There is oil in many countries in SSA, the challenge is moving it. Uganda has had to build a 1,500km pipeline through Tanzania. That’s a huge capital outlay; investors will only take the risk when the oil reserves are with it.
2767 2018-11-01 18:47:50 Bolton the Jewish Globalist stooge has a nerve criticizing other nations
They hate Venezuela becos it freed itself from IMF/World Bank Debt slavery

2769 2018-11-01 18:47:44 Lol I know the whole process of making garri and palm oil. It's very impossible to peel and fry garri in 24 hrs. You have to take it to mill to grind, mix with palm oil then tie it in bag and put in the machine to remove the starch. Dry it and sieve out the shaft before frying
2770 2018-11-01 18:47:44 It would have to be literally nothing, a muddy puddle with a rainbow of light oil across the top isn't that much worse!
2771 2018-11-01 18:47:16 If some oil got into the servo it will go very quick so be carefull

2774 2018-11-01 18:46:52 We can go back and forth on this but bottom line is we're more successful than you. Without oil money you'd be in league one.
2775 2018-11-01 18:46:49 Haven't we done a magaya on the muzarabani oil prospect,thought a resource is only confirmed after drilling has taken place.@matigary @TrevorNcube @fortunechasi @nickmangwana @MthuliNcube
2776 2018-11-01 18:46:26 Margarine or olive oil
2777 2018-11-01 18:46:15 BP stands for British Petroleum and I don't remember Britain ever having oil. I think the Americans have their arms tied with the middle east, but Theresa May was on an African tour not so long ago.
2778 2018-11-01 18:46:12 Definitely gotta learn to change my oil myself

2782 2018-11-01 18:45:30 Still holding APA and SLB. Any recommendations for better oil plays?
2783 2018-11-01 18:45:28 No reason why innovation and support for on alternate energy is coming. The oil lobby can't allow any other  to grow.

2789 2018-11-01 18:45:15 Fryer oil just splashed all over my hand I’m debating just cutting of the hand now
2790 2018-11-01 18:45:02 And you know what will surely make that number go down? Building the oil patch a subsidised pipeline, and then subsidising the companies themselves to keep going for another 40 years - oh, and maybe building a refinery, too, to ensure there's a demand for it for those 40 years.
2791 2018-11-01 18:44:43 Goto Bareburger they got it, it’s plant based meat made from wheat and potato proteins, as well as soy, coconut oil, and heme
2792 2018-11-01 18:44:38 Gold, diamonds, platinum, emeralds, and now oil. Zero benefit to us commoners
2793 2018-11-01 18:44:35 Mexico makes more revenue from illegals crossing border than selling oil
2794 2018-11-01 18:44:29 yeah if you didn't get your CBD's from a dispensary and it doesn't have at least a tinge of THC in it you are probably consuming the oil squeezed out of cat food or something.
2795 2018-11-01 18:44:29 You got this!!!!
2796 2018-11-01 18:44:28 Didn’t say they were evil, they’re just not helping the planet. Their messes are killing wildlife. Ever heard of all the oil spills in the Gulf? They pay big money to make sure no one knows about them.
2797 2018-11-01 18:44:24 Here come the west. "Kill your people. Be a dictator in your country. And give me your oil. Here a $5 million."
2798 2018-11-01 18:44:22 So who should we trust if I may ask?  And you think Dangote refinery is solely for refining Nigeria's oil...smh, this is just wishful thinking.

2802 2018-11-01 18:43:41 I can see them now all huddled around a burning oil drum.
2803 2018-11-01 18:43:38 We have outgrown empty promises, if anyone promises to reduce fuel price, that means going back to subsidy time, meaning those that defraud the oil & gas industry are coming back, meaning mortgaging the country,  PMB has no opponent, PDP made a wrong choice, I am an independent

2806 2018-11-01 18:43:30 India might manage to get a waiver from Donald Trump for importing oil from Iran (already 35% reduced compared to last year). 
55% of payment in Euro 
45% in Rupee thru UCO Bank (used for import of rice, drugs & other products from India)
Balance proceeds sit idle in Indian bank.
2807 2018-11-01 18:43:25 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund and the publisher of the National Enquirer. It has a mandate to support the oil companies and is working to introduce US style conservatism to Canada. It is propaganda, not news.
2808 2018-11-01 18:43:22 A friend just saw a little black dog dragging a blue leash down Front Street. It was small with a short haircut. A man stopped and got it. He worked for, she believes, AC/DC electrical. It was near the oil terminals.
2809 2018-11-01 18:43:21 if price of crude oil  has drop, it is only logical that the prices of it by-product such as petrol and kerosine etc also drop but hell no the reverse is the case. only  in buhari administration that the price of a product is inversely proportional to it by-product.

2814 2018-11-01 18:42:30 Need to hit a spa and get my back rubbed with some oil or somn 
2815 2018-11-01 18:42:29 Petrol price cut 5 rs mid night...Iran start to crude oil production...it is Diwali bonus for Indian economy... crude oil price will come back 4000 in Dec 2018... Petrol price 70 rs in Dec 2018... Gold price 29000 Dec 2018... Nifty 11000 Dec 2018... Sensex 37000 Dec 2018...

2822 2018-11-01 18:41:44 FYI an oil change doesn’t effect your steering, that’s power steering fluid bud. Maybe you’re behind on your oil change too

2834 2018-11-01 18:40:26 And I thought it was bad that you had to pull a tire and a fender insert to change the oil filter on the Chevrolet Beretta.
2835 2018-11-01 18:40:26 To be sure, cheap is a relative term. We're not as cheap as we were in the late 1990's, but purchasing power of oil against wages has come way, way back from expensive levels. One can graph a bunch of measures like this: similar results.

2846 2018-11-01 18:39:42 I voted for the @OntarioGreens I have one question about the carbon tax how are you going to penalize the oil companies with The Carbon tax  it sounds like you will just tax the people. So will the oil companies be held accountable?
2847 2018-11-01 18:39:37 How do you refine oil into gas

2849 2018-11-01 18:39:27 This is a lie.

G will not interfere with existing production. 

G protects the County from further expansion (including fracking), this is why big oil is spending millions lying to us.

This is big oil vs grass roots.

Vote YES on G

2852 2018-11-01 18:39:20 $AMRN Tell me you are basing your shorting of this stock on more than the tired, old "mineral oil as placebo" argument.  Tell me you have more than that.
2853 2018-11-01 18:39:20 Does this mean that in the absence of carbon taxes, we'll be fighting cheap oil all the way down? Hadn't considered that before. That is a scary thought. Hard to reduce consumption of something that is very cheap and getting cheaper all the time.
2854 2018-11-01 18:39:17 Women really just ingnore getting an oil change for their car

2859 2018-11-01 18:38:46 Looks like US prefers higher crude price thus, they can also be decent seller in oil market..
2860 2018-11-01 18:38:34 This is at at all propaganda, this is just a fact.

And even accounting for the future costs, the problem is that upstream and oil sands companies don’t have this kind of money set aside for future cleanup and reclamation. They don’t have nearly enough security put up.
2861 2018-11-01 18:38:29 You got a cheque from The PC government. Norway has a trillion dollars. The PC/UCP gave away all the oil revenues for nothing. That’s a fact. The royalties are pennies on the dollar. What a joke

2863 2018-11-01 18:38:05 Too many untradeables not enough oil investment lol
2864 2018-11-01 18:38:04 i’ve been sitting at the dealership for almost 3 hours why the fuck does an oil change and tire rotation take this long
2865 2018-11-01 18:37:49 Don’t forget to change your oil
2866 2018-11-01 18:37:42 Brent oil below $ 73
2867 2018-11-01 18:37:31 Inflation adjusted oil price historical average is about $41. Ignoring demand changes obviously. So I’m not sure if it can be easily labeled as cheap.
2868 2018-11-01 18:37:31 I used tend it on my late dad's piece of land here in Kenya.we grew it for commercially for cooking oil production.i had to stay on farm daytime to scare away birds from eating it before harvest.
2869 2018-11-01 18:37:26 Oil is there. It’s been long established. The question is whether it can be commercially exploited? Key issue with oil inland is having infrastructure to move it economically. And I understand that’s the challenge with Muzarabani
2870 2018-11-01 18:37:12 91 Trillion Naira oil money missing since 2016?? Egbami ooo...this is more than 12 years budget.Tell me somebody is joking oo.haa... Lost country

2884 2018-11-01 18:35:39 "Our" price? I don't own an oil company. And the differential is always $15-$25 regardless. The issue currently is lack of refining and good old fashioned over production. The industry did it to themselves.

2894 2018-11-01 18:34:37 EX mode is more of a fun thing to do as I recall. Mostly for a high score of its own category. You don't consume oil or anything trying it so it is nice to test things on it.
2895 2018-11-01 18:34:27 We once discovered diamonds. Many of us naïvely ululated. We thought our problems then were over. Today,our problems continue to mount. The diamonds seem like folklore.

2899 2018-11-01 18:33:59 You're still here after you completely ignored the naturalnews link given to you proving it lies?

You're out of your league. Still to the essential oil sellers and dog walkers
2900 2018-11-01 18:33:59 Common analytical mistake I see here in 2018: talking about oil prices in nominal terms, even though we're nearly 15 years past the price breakout year of 2004. Today's oil price is cheap, in both inflation + purchasing power terms, and reflects the new problem w/ demand growth.

2971 2018-11-01 18:27:36 Don’t draft skill players and demand they learn bottom six roles. Play them in the minors in top 6 situations/pp so they develop. They can learn to check in the AHL. GM’s don’t develop bottom 6 players and expect them to score 25 goals. Oil are mismanaging Pulju.

3017 2018-11-01 18:23:27 Time to review our code of practice and introduce design for seismic waves and earthquake compatibility in our structures with the recent tremor we are having here and there ,especially Abuja.
NSE/COREN wake up.
3018 2018-11-01 18:23:26 It is economically unrealistic to raise Nigerians hope that PMS will sell for #90/litre when it is not feasible in countries that have functional refineries and produce crude oil. Atiku's promise of PMS to sell @ #90/litre is a fallacy & will only intensify fuel subsidy fraud.

3020 2018-11-01 18:23:24 @Alba hotel. Engaging meru county leaders on the proposed Lokchar to Lamu crude oil pipeline. It was a wonderful exercise.
3021 2018-11-01 18:23:18 Lots of rises today.

3022 2018-11-01 18:23:17 i’m getting my oil changed and this 69 year old man says “getting arthritis is for the birds”
3023 2018-11-01 18:23:05 Olive oil!
3024 2018-11-01 18:22:48 Not to get you sidetracked, but YOU have a full body massage appointment with @RussellReed909 & myself at the house AFTER the hangout. I have the Lavender Oil you requested.
3025 2018-11-01 18:22:41 Need my brakes done air in my tires oil change like wtf
3026 2018-11-01 18:22:35 With @tito_mboweni as Finance Minister and Brent Crude oil trading at R72 & Tom Moyane fired, I kind of expect a wonderful December ahead if @CyrilRamaphosa won't do a #DesVanRooyen on us @maggsnaidu
3027 2018-11-01 18:22:29 This is not the time for incremental, 30-year plans. There needs to be a 10-year or even 5-year plan to get ourselves off the fossil fuel habit. We are not going to do it because we're all oil junkies. But we have to do it. We keep getting that message and blowing it off.
3028 2018-11-01 18:22:05 Ja America is coming for Zimbabwe oil.. God's Speed! Soon they will discover weapons of distraction in Zimbabwe.
3029 2018-11-01 18:22:03 @cfa_m Very dramatic decline in world crude oil prices. This fact has been  ignored, for reasons best known to them,  by the FPIs. Don't know when they will see the light at the end of the tunnel. @mosesharding
3030 2018-11-01 18:22:02 What a load of shit. Trump has been a mobster his entire life and you treat him like he’s some kind of messiah. He even said he hasn’t paid taxes in years. He’s a snake oil  salesman selling his lies to the most mindless people he can find. Guess you fit the bill. Congrats.
3031 2018-11-01 18:21:59 Oh no you don't.  Your side is winning award.  Ridiculous.  There are plenty of reasonable changes to our country.  Oil production. Coal miners getting jobs. Reducing jobs in White House & Federal employee.  Ending Korean shooting rockets. Bring jobs back to USA. End regulations.
3032 2018-11-01 18:21:59 Where were you when a Lady with a difficult variant of MS was taken to court in the Bailiwick of Guernsey and faced Life Imprisonment, for attempting to import Cannabis oil for her 'Needs'? PS Your Views have ZERO CURRENCY - Get out of your offices and help people in Need
3033 2018-11-01 18:21:53 In simple words.even if they eat all the money. Oil is still good for Zim because we wont be needing to import  since it takes too much forex so it  improves our trade balance. It will reduce cost of doing business too making our industries competetive.
3034 2018-11-01 18:21:42 Anything that involves smelly liquids. When I did auto detail, the smell of day-old brake-pad-and-motor-oil water could make me gag 100 percent sober.
3035 2018-11-01 18:21:37 Sierra oil , gasolina , gerald , cuñados , estafa maestra ya ellos llenaron la bolsa ....
3036 2018-11-01 18:21:27 Market ignored early weakness in NQ; oil dropping all day; BKX sagging most of day. Today was back to clinging to strength.
3037 2018-11-01 18:21:04 ??? just mad init City pay a player twice what Sanchez makes and nothing gets said. We earn our money, you lot are just oil funded. Honestly ruining football with your money.
3038 2018-11-01 18:21:00 Okay let me indulge u even if it’s for d sake of dis convo dat d we should depend of dan gote refinery as a strategy, 1 barrel of crude oil ( not refined) cost 73  and in a barrel we hv about 100-200litres with exchange rate in mind calculate d cost of 1L is in NGN pls
3039 2018-11-01 18:20:53 Just my butt/hips, I used bio oil on my stomach
3040 2018-11-01 18:20:52 This guy on Al Jazeera just said that the only way America will stop Saudi is if the Yemeni people bomb the oil fields, they cut him off so quick 
3041 2018-11-01 18:20:51 ladies, a little holistic tip. evening primrose oil daily & I promise, you will never suffer another cramp a day in your life.
3042 2018-11-01 18:20:49 Yes, immediately he gets to power in his Adamawa village, he will start local refining of crude oil that's sufficient for local consumption in the refineries his government built within 2009 - 2007.
3043 2018-11-01 18:20:40 Guys always try to help me when I’m checking my oil  like thank you but i got it 
3044 2018-11-01 18:20:32 Oil changes give me a lot of anxiety every time I go they always tell me I got hundreds of dollars worth of repairs and I just can’t
3045 2018-11-01 18:20:19 They are doing a spinoff after
3046 2018-11-01 18:19:59 Definitely don’t have an oil change 
3047 2018-11-01 18:19:52 hello i just mistook a bottle of oil for a bottle of squash and mixed it with water how is ur thursday night going ;)

3049 2018-11-01 18:19:43 Off To Melbourne Australia  For The Fresh Oil Conference.. See Later 
3050 2018-11-01 18:19:42 It's funny seeing all these comments on the oil discovery. Now I realise uninformed speculation is really dangerous. Maybe ask a petroleum engineer (yours truly) before you equate it to industries that share no similarity to it
3051 2018-11-01 18:19:41 I've seen a lot of olive oil rhetoric goin around these past couple days  why??
3052 2018-11-01 18:19:38 Oil? What happened while I was asleep?

3056 2018-11-01 18:19:15 @LCP @EPhilippePM Et agir sur le kérosène des avions et le gaz oil des gros bateaux c’est pour quand ? 
3057 2018-11-01 18:19:11 On fourth November, the democracy will meet its dead end when America targets Iran's oil industry with a one sided decision, far from the United Nations chart of demands.
3058 2018-11-01 18:19:10 We need Middle East oil to pay back our war. Then keep it pumping to clear debt
3059 2018-11-01 18:19:09 1 dead guy vs cheap oil yeah right. Nothing will change but all the noise over it, so quit with the stupid BS
3060 2018-11-01 18:19:04 Haiwaaa kupiko,vanhu avo vaona gold nxt to Mavuradonha mountains,their strategy is to mine mine mine on the pretexting of setting up the oil extraction machines which needs some time,watch the space

3062 2018-11-01 18:18:53 Coconut oil beloved
3063 2018-11-01 18:18:40 Just look at NDP claiming to want to protect wild salmon while they consider halting salmon farming. Yet they halt a safe pipeline in favour of trucks and train tanker cars running oil down the banks of two iconic salmon rivers in BC. One derailment we can kiss wild salmon goodby
3064 2018-11-01 18:18:40 This lady is beyond redemption am tired of her.
3065 2018-11-01 18:18:31 Today I took a whiff of some lavender oil and I let a moan out so loud I instantly became a 55 year old mother dancing on the beach at night with arms flailed, shoes off.
3066 2018-11-01 18:18:30 Is an oil change typically supposed to take an hour?? Because
3067 2018-11-01 18:18:30 How wild would it be if I got a tattoo of a bottle of olive oil

3070 2018-11-01 18:17:55 sorry chairman
3071 2018-11-01 18:17:27 i took apart/rebuilt my trimmers 5 times before i realized i just needed to oil them -.-
3072 2018-11-01 18:17:25 1st strive denounced US Sanctions, we all insulted him. 2nd Magaya reveals cure for HIV and everyone is shooting him down. then an Australian company  says it discovered Oil in Muzarabani and its all over the news and social media when are we goin to celebrate our own achivements
3073 2018-11-01 18:17:22 I dont know if anybody else watches shahs of sunset but i do and when gigi decided to start her wusah business i started looking into the oil extracts to see if any of them would help me and i found a few strains that i think would help with depression and anxiety
3074 2018-11-01 18:17:10 Wonder if the Venezuela cash for oil trade deal was mentioned?
3075 2018-11-01 18:17:02 Bathong Zimbabwe, oil?! 
3076 2018-11-01 18:16:55 I’ve never even done my own oil change. Dad just gets them done for me 
3077 2018-11-01 18:16:54 I wish someone would get my Oil changed
3078 2018-11-01 18:16:53 Crude oil !!!
3079 2018-11-01 18:16:45 I usually sauté garlic in oil, whiz toms, chickpeas n purée to a mush & add to garlic, season cook 5 mins gently, add veg stock 1L & big pinch of dried rosemary then add about 200g soup pasta (mini conchigliette type). Cook until al dente. Tradition  with oil, kids like 
3080 2018-11-01 18:16:44 oh lordddd do i feel this except for me it’s “i gotta get back on my hair oil routine”
3081 2018-11-01 18:16:36 That doesn’t really add up when you consider Scotland is getting £1.9 billion less than we got in 2010 - when oil was the same price as it is now.....
3082 2018-11-01 18:16:35 Yeah agree with all that BUT you should IMHO take the truss rod nut off and lubricate the the thread with a little vaseline (not anything oil based), especially on old instruments. You need a bit of experience before adjusting, I've seen snapped rods before, bugger to fix
3083 2018-11-01 18:16:24 How long before their newfound resource is labeled “blood oil” due to the manner in which it is brought to market?
3084 2018-11-01 18:16:22 The #US has broadly agreed to grant #India a waiver from Iran sanctions, which would allow Indian oil companies to continue to import about 1.25 million tonnes of oil a month till March from #Iran. This waiver for India has come 3 Days before US will impose sanctions on Iran

3085 2018-11-01 18:16:07 Yes, as I point out in my Oil Fall series, the $OSX names never recovered post 2014. Uncharacteristically, the oil industry--while constrained to make any bold moves to chart a new course--at least have chosen correctly to lower their investment spending.
3086 2018-11-01 18:16:07 Babe. Christmas list.... I want Polo Blue orrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr any oil based cologne that’s gonna make you wanna sex me up when you hug me. @JamaicanPhoenix
3087 2018-11-01 18:16:05 Padahal dulu sempat ada kepengen di oil & gas...mahluk2 bgtu suka tempat sunyi memang huhu
3088 2018-11-01 18:15:54 my dad is making me pay to get my oil changed for the first time in my life and i’m not happy with him. 
3089 2018-11-01 18:15:48 You aren't reading what I am writing. I said it is destroying the banking cartel, not banks. The cartel is our enemy. Banking as a whole is not. Exxon owns a lot of oil too but it isn't centralized. And Ripple owns less XRP than they did before. If you don't feel comfortable 1/x
3090 2018-11-01 18:15:45 Papa deceiving Pikins stop.all this lies, we know the tag"looting thief",is at the centre of the letter D of ur names.we no its not possible when u don't have refineries ,except Atiku and Obj has agreed to refine the oil free Togo,were Baba's refinery is located
3091 2018-11-01 18:15:44  i thought you’d have that! I always question if girls have oil changes 
3092 2018-11-01 18:15:40 Note to self - my new CBD oil makes me puke when taken on an empty stomach. 
3093 2018-11-01 18:15:37 STERLING, EURO both higher, DOLLAR in correction, CRUDE OIL in decline, WTI down at 63.70 USD, GOLD back above 1,230 USD and WALL STREET rising ...
3094 2018-11-01 18:15:37 Apparently Tide Pens don't work on oil stains. Now my shirt looks like it has smallpox.
3095 2018-11-01 18:15:35 a queen
3096 2018-11-01 18:15:16 I need a oil change!!!
3097 2018-11-01 18:15:15 You know how to change oil?
3098 2018-11-01 18:15:00 Over 5 million Californians live within 1 mile of an oil/gas well. Over 1 million Californians signed petitions urging @JerryBrownGov to put an end to fossil fuel permitting & phase out oil drilling in CA communities. Today, we're delivering them to Sacramento #BrownsLastChance
3099 2018-11-01 18:14:57 Due to road blocks and protests, oil tankers haven't reached lahore and there is temporary petrol shortage in city, Avoid unnecessary going out and save your resources.
3100 2018-11-01 18:14:51 I disagree because say the DO is not Tainted is akin to saying oil is not oily. The taint is him so how could he not be it.
3101 2018-11-01 18:14:48 lol Moroccan oil + jet black hair!
3102 2018-11-01 18:14:47 Tried to make toast.  Put bread under grill, went to play with new oil diffuser, wondered what smell was, realised it was toast.  Ran to kitchen, got oven gloves, removed grill-pan, dumped cremated remains, put hands (still in oven gloves) to forehead in horror, burnt forehead.
3103 2018-11-01 18:14:41 Well meaning Nigerians will never make the mistake of casting their valuable votes to a group of lootocrats and known oil bunkerers. It is Buhari till 2023 In shaa Allah.
3104 2018-11-01 18:14:34 Yes.
I mentioned earlier, we need to go back to agriculture. Agriculture sustained us well before the oil boom which made us lazy.
I remember ground nuts (pyramids), Coco, Cashew were the major source of income back in the days and everyone was fine.
3105 2018-11-01 18:14:34 You're making too much of what these people look like. 
I wouldn't care if it was 500,000 Chinese,  Russians, Canadians coming yearly or if 10,000  Brits were caravanning to the border.
They just happen to be " brown people."
3106 2018-11-01 18:14:08 I gave my dad my credit card so he could take my car to get an oil change. I checked the Chase app and now he’s buying all other types of shit
3107 2018-11-01 18:14:04 @RichieAllenShow my friend has just died from C age 53 - he worked for ABB oil and gas
3108 2018-11-01 18:13:59 Obama basically shut down USA oil production making USA dependent on mid east & Space Program. Making USA dependent on RUSSIA! Accident or intentional?

3110 2018-11-01 18:13:55 CBD Oil that doesn’t contain THC rub on your temples. Works wonders.
3111 2018-11-01 18:13:46 1947 was the first big oil strike at Leduc, and until 2015 conservatives had been in power since 1935. So there’s lots of inertia.
3112 2018-11-01 18:13:41 We are not excited because we all know our government thugs will be stealing and not giving shit to the people. Infact we don’t even want this oil. God take it back.
3113 2018-11-01 18:13:38  they let me leave !! Going get this oil change 
3114 2018-11-01 18:13:33 no demand growth this time of year --not going to trade on when I think there will be an outage ---Iranians selling their oil ---and Brent has been hit too ---Thanks for the well wishes
3115 2018-11-01 18:13:24 He obviously had been sent by the very government to divert the people's attention from the real issues affecting Zimbabwe. Knowing Zimbabweans, just give them something to argue about they will forget the bread, fuel, cooking oil or whatever queue!

3121 2018-11-01 18:12:54 @itvnewscentral @itvnews Why does none of the coverage mention that Billy’s mum’s company sells cannabis oil  not quite the selfless devoted mother she is making out . #itvnews. #itvnewscentral
3122 2018-11-01 18:12:43 So annoying when you go to eat out and after serving you, the waiter puts one piece of serviette.
Like this food has lots of oil and a pack of serviette costs N50 or thereabout.
Can you not be sill?!

3127 2018-11-01 18:11:59 Oil and gas discovered in Zim, Lord let this not be another Afghanistan, Lord let this not be another Libya saga  

Lord please be with us now...
3128 2018-11-01 18:11:54 This video completely fails to mention the pollution caused by the exploration/drilling/trankering/refining (obscene amounts of power required)/ transporting to fuel stations of the oil/petrol/diesel in the first place....
So the figures are way out in favour of ICE.
3129 2018-11-01 18:11:49 Hope this oil change don’t take forever  Knowing i got to go to work 
3130 2018-11-01 18:11:46 When you call the dealership to get an oil change and ask how much would it be and they say your first 2 are free  #wonthedoit
3131 2018-11-01 18:11:44 それ考えたらキリないwwwwww
運転なんか適当よ。自分味方乗せて突っ込んで何回パーティー潰したか…立ち回りなんて轢くか殺されるかの2択とかしか考えてない
3132 2018-11-01 18:11:42 It was a chick who bought my fgo account for £4k, and it wasn't that much of expense for her. 

I got to know her last night, apparently her family owns an oil company in South America.

I should've ask for more money 
#FateGO
3133 2018-11-01 18:11:32 the environmentalists oppose the pipeline because they oppose the expansion of the oil, they don't want more oil in their region, filling more tankers that could damage the environment not because they're against safety or prosperity.
3134 2018-11-01 18:11:29 One could certainly make a Jevons rebound case for total, future energy demand as electrics flood the globe. However, there's no escaping that e-scooters, e-bikes, EV especially, (and then later aerial and terrestrial e-robots) are about to hit oil where it matters: the margin.
3135 2018-11-01 18:11:20 Oil cartel loading. Diamonds, gold, agriculture done with and dusted.
3136 2018-11-01 18:10:52 Castor oil!
3137 2018-11-01 18:10:46 Remember to change the oil in your car folks
3138 2018-11-01 18:10:18 Do enlightened. .. . Go check your oil w yourself.
3139 2018-11-01 18:10:13  Hydrate consistently. 

* Active Hydration Serum is so helpful for this. It helps keep your skin moisturized all day long, corrects oil production, and evens your skin tone.

3140 2018-11-01 18:10:07 yeah i believe we should have stood our ground there and told her to go to hell

we would have possibly got cheaper oil from Iran and USA would still come begging to do trade with us

again all about standing up to the bully for what is right for us
3141 2018-11-01 18:10:03 ああ、これ？スポーツブラ。油の貯蔵庫が垂れちゃうからね。

3143 2018-11-01 18:09:49 Yeah, the old con man is selling snake oil to the unsuspecting young people.
3144 2018-11-01 18:09:33 I miss the little trailer but this one is pretty nice.  Good luck, stay safe and bring home the .  you guys.
3145 2018-11-01 18:09:07 It was all done for the Oil Cartel headed up by the Saudi Sunnis that
have hated the Iranian Shiites since time began.
The "bad guys"  in the Middle East are the Saudi Sunnis and the Israeli 
Likud Jews.  Now they are "coming out".  
Trump loves both of them.
Trump loves money.
3146 2018-11-01 18:08:56 And all i want is a 3.99 bottle of cooking oil ,guess its too much to ask for.
3147 2018-11-01 18:08:55 Left a question on your Twitter feed regarding Rose Oil. 
Thanks for the insight.

3149 2018-11-01 18:08:49 @tessavirtue I hope you're feeling better after last night's show. If you do get migraines, a great relief for me has been peppermint essential oil. Rubbing on on your temples or the back of your head helps so much. Enjoy the rest of the tour! #ttyct is spectacular!

3158 2018-11-01 18:08:17 The movie I was talking about is a similar Asian version of that grindhouse movie planet terror with rose McGowan they kill somebody and your costume looks exactly to how they do it they use deep fryer oil and then the person to arm looks exactly you. then they dunk his face

3160 2018-11-01 18:08:15 Unscathed and accused of "magic" now she threw the oil at the emperor who went blind. He begged her for mercy, she said only the true God could grant that. Antoninus Pius regained his sight and stopped persecuting Christians. 

But new ruler, same problems.
3161 2018-11-01 18:08:13 Can someone explain to me HOW I just got waxed 60 dollars for an oil change????
3162 2018-11-01 18:08:11 The cardio community needs to look at it that way too... it has to be separated from fish oil supplements and population educated ! I hope Wall Street does not see this is cooking results ! Good luck deepak !
3163 2018-11-01 18:08:11 I clicked over to your Rose Oil article. 
Can you use Rose Hip oil - organic - in this process?

3166 2018-11-01 18:07:50 At 30 she was arrested in what's now Turkey, charged with blasphemy and causing harm to the empire. 
Told to denounce her faith, tortured a million ways including a helmet with nails and being put into a kettle of oil and tar.
3167 2018-11-01 18:07:37 but India still has a long way to go. Nikki Haley was bullying India to not buy oil from Iran. These things are far from perfect.

3169 2018-11-01 18:07:15 Am not arguing here-Outside a Pick n Pay on Jason Moyo Avenue in Harare, a frustrated crowd gathered. The supermarket’s security shut the steel doors to the shop. A rare commodity, which has been almost impossible 2 find 4 weeks, is finally on sale: cooking oil. Wat do u cal that
3170 2018-11-01 18:07:13 They’re playing how I met your mother in this jiffy lube and it makes me want to throw myself into the little oil change pit and never come out

3175 2018-11-01 18:06:46 Houston - only thing keeping it afloat is the port of Houston and oil and gas. Homelessness has reach epidemic for whites and blacks. Illegals obliterate our social services, no help for American citizens. Last Republican mayor left office 1989.

3179 2018-11-01 18:06:34 With all due respect to those in authority. The thing which is of primary concern to the ordinary person is not the oil in mzarabani, it's the desire to be able to put food on the table for the family.

Good luck with that.

You don't have to be big oil or have many critical thinking skills to realize this cost will be paid by us.

If we're gonna take on another tax the results better be clear and defineable.

Trump is a snake oil salesman..
Trump says 15,000 troops heading to border..
Let's see if that happens.
Trump promised a tax cut before mid term?

3215 2018-11-01 18:03:32 Lmfao, I work in the oilfield and I assure you we are in the start of another boom!  Price of oil has been above $60.00 all year!  The oil companies are ramping up for more pipelines, more wells.  Anything above $45.00 and they're making money.  The $10 decrease is no worry.

3227 2018-11-01 18:02:35 If a law passed were to result in intentionally, inadvertently or as an unintended consequence, enriching an individual as a direct result of engaging in unlawful activity, common sense says that law should be declared unlawful itself.

3254 2018-11-01 17:59:13 I am trying too. I find it doable when shopping, especially in France where many brands now use "palm oil free" labels as selling point, but more difficult when eating out.

3269 2018-11-01 17:57:11 Actually, China is doing more for CO2 reductions than Canada and Germany combined. They plan to open 10-12 nuclear plants per year, 0 CO2 emissions. Germany has to rely too much on oil/gas/coal (high CO2 emissions).

3272 2018-11-01 17:56:50 I really hope this fails. Countries that have committed so many atrocities in recent history really don’t deserve the kind of power that comes with oil.
3273 2018-11-01 17:56:47 Free oils. Seemingly harmless, I mean this topic includes the giants such as olive oil, flax oil, and coconut oil to name a few...but I would think twice before adding a zero nutrition caloricly dense food-like product. Your body is not well suited for ingesting pure oils. #vegan
3274 2018-11-01 17:56:15 The oil field warrior remains alive and well in Texas.  We are fighting not just for science, fact, and due process, but literally for Truth, Justice, and the American Way.  Our opponents? Socialist dictators, global oligarchs, and elitist hypocrites.
3275 2018-11-01 17:56:12 A few reasons why the oil could go the same way as the Marange diamonds:

1. There is no proper legal framework for exploitation of oil 

2. There is no talk of environmental safeguards for the communities in Muzarabani 

3. A reputable international firm explored the...

3278 2018-11-01 17:55:58 This has been known for ages.  Ask anyone from Muzarabani they will tell you prospecting for oil happened in that area in the late 1980s.  Nothing new here. I sense this an attempt to improve Zim’s economic outlook and improve credit rating for international borrowing

3282 2018-11-01 17:55:51 That's true. And I think there are other issues as well. I'm still on the fence over how Iran should be handled. Maybe the EU has the right idea. Or maybe the EU is being cynical and just want that sweet oil&gas as well as a market for cars.
3283 2018-11-01 17:55:47 This is CLEARLY Hollywood elitist CGI! Everyone knows it, bigly, and I think it’s time to tariff Hollywood! We can shut them up by starting a Trade war against elitists! Who’s product is more better - CGI or oil? TOTAL DISGRACE VERY UNFAIR!!
3284 2018-11-01 17:55:24 And what's the price of crude oil in the international market?
3285 2018-11-01 17:55:17 Konki! Konki! Konki! Oil chafu 
3286 2018-11-01 17:54:58 Holiday baking tip from me 2 you: applesauce is a gr8 substitute for vegetable oil!!
3287 2018-11-01 17:54:58 I think I would do a garlic zucchini pasta. I would grill the rotisserie with olive oil, lemon and white wine. Then mince the black garlic with butter, to make a sort of scampi sauce. Then throw the noodles in there and toss the feta at the top.
3288 2018-11-01 17:54:57 Oil discovery only means more trouble for Zimbabwe: the military now has more reason and resources to maintain a stranglehold on the state.

3293 2018-11-01 17:54:31 building the NLNG train 7 to diversify our economy from oil to gas, doing AKK project to ensure constant gas supply for power generation plants, completing all pdp abandoned projects including Goodluck jonathan highway Otuoke, such a man is not a calamity by my standards!!
3294 2018-11-01 17:54:02 Shashi don't put more oil on fire.

3298 2018-11-01 17:53:32 While you wouldn’t think otherwise, oil is a smaller part of Alberta’s fairly diverse economy than it has ever been. It’s just that the industry is politically powerful and govt revenues are too dependent on royalties.
3299 2018-11-01 17:53:32 $30 oil change can't beat that

3302 2018-11-01 17:53:18 If you've been wondering who's behind Amendment 75, we may be one step closer to knowing. In the past week, Stop Buying Our Elections got its largest contribution to date, a $10,000 check from Extraction Oil and Gas. #copolitics @colo_politics

Uh, in some instances. But hey... narrow gauge train rails 

We'd be rich from oil but wouldn't have a cod or a turr or a salmon left
3305 2018-11-01 17:53:01 How long will Saudi Arabia's "oil wealth" last?  The world is changing. Saudi economy is in DEEP trouble.  The contracts they have with Canada, the USA & European countries are mostly future sales. They're slyly buying the silence of the western world. Let's not be suckers.

3308 2018-11-01 17:52:10 Fucking home brewers.  Of course they think garbage water like IPAs are good.  Otherwise they would have to admit to themselves their home brews taste like shit, too.
3309 2018-11-01 17:52:05 an awful lot of oil must have grown underground in the 4 years since Scotland was told that north sea oil was all but finished
3310 2018-11-01 17:51:59 I truly don’t know. If a train derails with oil and that oil spills. Is that less harmful than if a pipeline bursts in the middle of nowhere and spills for hours before it can be shut off. I’m remembering that footage of the gulf cost leak that they couldn’t shut off
3311 2018-11-01 17:51:49 Have you got any snake oil on offer David?
3312 2018-11-01 17:51:48 Well depending on the company and the kind of oil you get it does help.

3319 2018-11-01 17:51:12 Thank you. Now let's stop selling them weapons and buying their oil. Demands are just wishes without action.
3320 2018-11-01 17:51:03 Orange overall time. He has cost this country billions in lost foreign revenue, but hey, who is counting? What about all the oil that was sold at US$29 per barrel. Agh, no point in saying any more. Viva RSA. Let us all go down together. Yay! See you all on the beaches surfing!
3321 2018-11-01 17:51:03 RIGHT!??! 

Look I know y'all are trying to upsell & have a job to do. But, please just change the oil. Thank you for time & consideration in this matter.
3322 2018-11-01 17:51:02 Family and money = Oil and water.
3323 2018-11-01 17:51:01 & what type of 'oil' is it; crude, unleaded or diesel etc. Misuse & bad 'mining' may be as damaging to the humanity as burning fossil types
3324 2018-11-01 17:50:51 Ross Thomson, conservative MP: "There is still a lot of life left in North sea oil, potentially 17 billion barrels" - thank you once again Ross for your assistance in achieving #Indyref2
3325 2018-11-01 17:50:38 Diamonds were discovered and this time its oil.What are we going to benefit from such discoveries
3326 2018-11-01 17:50:32 I asked my antie to try out a new formulation for her skin... kwes comes back and raves about how it's good for her hair too. 

Y'all know what, I'm taking all the wins I can get today. I'm happy my stretch mark oil does wonders for the hair too
3327 2018-11-01 17:50:28 It’s probably a placebo effect pushed by oil companies for their own monetary agenda and you ate that up. But I mean I really don’t know shit so don’t listen to me
3328 2018-11-01 17:50:25 Let the government control Big Oil... What could possibly go wrong?? 
3329 2018-11-01 17:50:17 I'm canvassing this weekend hoping to channel my outrage in helpful ways. Yes! The change in brilliance of colors is amazing. Love the pic of your mosaics...love the purple so regal and soothing like the lavender oil I diffuse.
3330 2018-11-01 17:50:16 Lmfao, I’ve seen this. You poor dudes need relaxer just for your face hair. Try borage oil topically mixed with about 1/4-1/3 cup of whatever oil works for your face, after you shave.  I use it for my rash-y whiteness.

Add more cider vinegar and olive oil.
3333 2018-11-01 17:49:35 I’m going to fry the tortillas into chips  and grill the pork in olive oil, garlic, salt and pepper. Make a strawberry infused parsley/lime creme sauce to create nachos !
3334 2018-11-01 17:49:34 Errrrrrrrr! And why does America have problems in the middle east?....  Be honest if Saudi Arabia was selling candle wax and not oil America nor the rest of the world wouldn't give a shit about it.....
3335 2018-11-01 17:49:34 So I’m in new department or team where I have to dispute damages and it’s day one and I have to learn car parts  all I ever knew about cars was put fuel in em, add air , and change the oil
3336 2018-11-01 17:49:30 Trump is not smart, except in the same way that con men are smart. 

It's just that uneducated white males over 65 yrs old & quite a few of our white male pundits buy his snake oil.

3337 2018-11-01 17:49:23 Just imagine how great the used market is going to be for lower priced Teslas. No worries about blown gaskets or oil leaks.
3338 2018-11-01 17:49:21 Outlaw beard oil..awesome!!
3339 2018-11-01 17:49:12 oh!イル
3340 2018-11-01 17:49:07 I at least got a free oil change out of the ordeal..some silver lining, kinda lol
3341 2018-11-01 17:49:06 The rest is Nozema, 100% pure Tea tree oil, and Clean&Clear moisturizer. In that order.
3342 2018-11-01 17:49:05 Oh lol alright then.. Your intial tweet get as e be asking to see "the BIG IDEA" that I assume you will know could never exist. Dem talk sey dem don dey follow international oil regulators talk. *sigh
3343 2018-11-01 17:48:49 And gets tons & tons of oil money in the bargain - vermin & s--t will do anything for money even call her dad a dog
3344 2018-11-01 17:48:47 Wait - did you already do the oil spill?
3345 2018-11-01 17:48:47 Oil subsidy I think has been sorted as well
3346 2018-11-01 17:48:41 Right up until we start imposing sanctions on them.  They import most of their food, what do they do when nobody is sending them any, eat oil?
3347 2018-11-01 17:48:41 On a more positive note, y'all ever have a bad toothache, I got 2words, Clove Oil. Stuff is awesome! I was in complete agony for a few days and dentist was booked. Found it at Walgreens, best $8 relief ever.
3348 2018-11-01 17:48:40 Sorry, can’t buy into any associated piece to Soros!  Oil companies aren’t evil and if you believe they are, turn out your lights and stop charging your electronics!
3349 2018-11-01 17:48:39 Ur mcm uses bio oil on his face as moisturiser.
3350 2018-11-01 17:48:33 They need us to survive,they invaded Iraq for a lot less oil,it wont be easy,they'll use every trick they know,but history shows as in India,they can't hold on too countries for ever
3351 2018-11-01 17:48:19 I honestly love how people that are not from Texas telling us to vote for Beto. Like we have no option! I also wonder if they realize that most Texans work for the oil field so pretty sure people are going to be voting for Cruz. So how about people stop the commentary.
3352 2018-11-01 17:48:17 I worked in the oil industry for about 10 years. I'm taking a break right now to be at home with my kids though. What's your specialty?
3353 2018-11-01 17:48:16 I forgot i need a oil change
3354 2018-11-01 17:48:10 #mandysclassf18 This experiment sought out to determine what liquid would decay an egg’s shell quickest, vinegar, olive oil, or water.
3355 2018-11-01 17:48:01 Yes! 
So, no on 74. It is a trick. Oil and gas is behind it. Yes on 112. Same reason. No on 109 yes on 110. They're the same issue, but 110 has a way better repay option.
3356 2018-11-01 17:48:00 Ugh I just had to get rid of my 2005 Ford Escape - 200,000 miles. It was heartbreaking. She was dumping oil everywhere so she had to go
3357 2018-11-01 17:47:51 It's a gr8..and welcome move. Kudos to #NarendraModi and team for achieving the impossibe.Hope waiver would lead to restrict Indian economy from dropping further due #crude oil crisis..
#IranSanctions
3358 2018-11-01 17:47:51 Shale Revolution. The Permian is the most successful area. Techniques & improvements in tech via accessing shale formations has led to huge output levels of oil. Directional drilling, ‘fracking’ & well designs, yep absolutely. US has mastered this quickly. Lots elsewhere mind!
3359 2018-11-01 17:47:50 FYI-Colorado produces about 4% of total US crude oil production and has the 6th largest natural gas reserves. There are 36,000 producing wells in 2018. It’s a big part of the economy.
3360 2018-11-01 17:47:45 My level of extra is buying coconut oil infused toilet roll for the flat
3361 2018-11-01 17:47:34 I’m vegan but omg so much oil
3362 2018-11-01 17:47:32 The stupidity of the leadership of this country is shiny and bright isn’t it. Don’t worry the oil problem will balance itself
3363 2018-11-01 17:47:24 holding up countries for their oil to put the gas in your car so you can get to work on the roads they built for you... you should feel so lucky and privileged to have that money taken from your check without your consent by such benevolent rulers.
3364 2018-11-01 17:47:12 With WTI crude oil still up YTD, the drop in inflation expectations (mainly in the front-end of the curve) is a result of the recent backup in real treasury rates as Fed rate hikes expectations are pushed down.
3365 2018-11-01 17:47:11 Oil Hits 6-Month Lows, Giving Trump Low Price Wish for Elections
3366 2018-11-01 17:47:10 I actually need an oil change
3367 2018-11-01 17:47:07 It's the grand plan to get the oil out of Venezuela. Putin told trump that is the plan. Next Iran.
3368 2018-11-01 17:46:50 @fordnation It will last a couple of weeks then oil companies will raise the price and eat the savings. Who still heats their homes with oil anymore maybe 5% of the population. You also stopped the rebate the the federal gov't was going to give.
3369 2018-11-01 17:46:33 
3370 2018-11-01 17:46:30 Animal grazing is a SERIOUS threat to ecosystems and the environment not just "affects" Grazing lands need to be converted to agriculture or forests if humans are to survive long-term. It's more than big oil, and we are not stupid
3371 2018-11-01 17:46:25 It's rather exhausting hearing these announcements when your rational mind tells you it's another snake oil sells pitch, always leads to nothing.
3372 2018-11-01 17:46:23 Fish are very healthy specially the oil ones like Mackerel but I never enjoyed eating it
3373 2018-11-01 17:46:22 Good to know. But can you give us how much @OfficialPDPNig and its past leader cabal were taken then to compare vis-a-vis crude oil price as at then.
3374 2018-11-01 17:46:20 So my car has a really bad oil leak that’ll cost $1500 to get fixed, without my car it’s hard for me to work so I guess I’m gonna have to make time to open commissions again  I’m already overly exhausted and this just....doesn’t help
3375 2018-11-01 17:46:12 For example the east side there were a horrendous amount of militias, including Benghazi, Derna, Bida, Ajdabiya and even the oil crescent area. Currently,  the LNA is solely dominating the region.
3376 2018-11-01 17:46:07 I agree... supporting a liar who cheated on wives, raped his second wife, supports Putin, Russia, Saudis to keep us tied to oil with increased prices ( just wait until after the elections), uses tariffs to increase taxes on Americans to pay for the tax cut is pretty stupid!
3377 2018-11-01 17:46:05 Check your Engine oil this morning.
3378 2018-11-01 17:46:01 Ur head has oil... If she ain't annoying... She ain't the one
3379 2018-11-01 17:45:59 Look who’s talking... Those who made sure oil Refineries remained oblivion for their cronies to keep importing fuels.
3380 2018-11-01 17:45:59 Showing 1minute chart n analysing oil prices, Subhan Allah apki Aqal py jo waqai nahi ha, go n get some sleep..
3381 2018-11-01 17:45:47 The cleanup for the Fort McMurray Oil Sands alone is estimated to cost over $200B.  Petroleum companies are unscrupulous and basically leave others to clean up and assume the costs of their mess. @OilGasCanada
3382 2018-11-01 17:45:43 How tf does audacity burn??? I mean, aren’t you sposed to stand there, put in hot oil over high heat, 20 seconds each side? 
3383 2018-11-01 17:45:32 Think we will hit a high close to 11.6mbd and then come off. What will be interesting is this will happen when analysts revise growth expectations numbers higher late this year early next. NB in March I compiled listed E&Ps equity analyst oil targets and they were at 1.43mb
3384 2018-11-01 17:45:19 Signaling that he’s playing us. Whatever he says his base loves it. He’s telling us he lied about the inauguration and he’s lying about this. But he doesn’t care because his people will buy it. Snake oil salesman.
3385 2018-11-01 17:45:02 Nothing better than a refreshing can of baked beans and Despicable Me 3 after a long hard day in the oil fields.
3386 2018-11-01 17:44:58 anyone else wonder if they toss those baby ducks in some oil just to film the Dawn dish soap commercials???
3387 2018-11-01 17:44:52 So 20 yes under sanctions we had oil that could have saved us but did nothing with it . What a shame
3388 2018-11-01 17:44:46 That oil change light always on 
3389 2018-11-01 17:44:43 & when youre extra pumped that you're killing 2 birds with one stone and getting an oil change during work. Crushing life today.

3391 2018-11-01 17:44:26 I think Zimbabwe is their maiden oil prospect
3392 2018-11-01 17:44:22 Oh wow I use a peppermint oil based spray in my bathroom, and some got on the toilet paper and let me tell you I am EXHILARATED after that shit.
3393 2018-11-01 17:44:18 I make an essential oil roller sweet almond oil with peppermint oil and Lavender oil It Works healing thoughts
3394 2018-11-01 17:44:17 Where there is oil the world over there is war, should we be worried? I am asking for a friend.

Just when I thought we could never get a worse curse than Diamond, The Revolutionary Party, Bob, the Cartel, Fake Prophets, you name it. Now this?
3409 2018-11-01 17:42:55 Did you learn how to change the oil in your car? Very grease lightning lol

3412 2018-11-01 17:42:50 Usted y Evo serán los únicos que pretenden quebrar a sus países respectivos, porque no se entiende de otra manera que tenga en ese estado a su país y a su gente en la miseria. Para que todo eso, para seguir a quien? Solo la quebrada Cuba que vive del turismo se beneficia del oil.
3413 2018-11-01 17:42:48 So im sitting there waiting for my oil change, and this guy has been staring at me (wearing my partner hoodie) he finally ask "which @playdreadnought partner are you?" Im GrimmHammer. "Holy s**t no way?!" Your guides are amazing and really eased my grind struggle! Made my day :)
3414 2018-11-01 17:42:45 The tea tree oil at the beauty supply makes it a lot easier to do so.
3415 2018-11-01 17:42:42 for all we know thry might alreay be exporting oil ..zim so kaa haayas
3416 2018-11-01 17:42:41 Did Makandiwa not prophesy about oil discovery at one point ???Since this week is announcement week and raiding.Are we raiding anyone for oil saga
3417 2018-11-01 17:42:40 so i grab the tee trea oil and moni starts piling my scalp  i could’ve cried tbh.
3418 2018-11-01 17:42:29 lol..
3419 2018-11-01 17:42:19 i was scratching my head viciously (after i big chopped my scalp got itchy af) and i’m like i gotta oil this shit.
3420 2018-11-01 17:42:17 Lots of oil required during toasting also. Like saturated in or covered in 80s style oil spray.
3421 2018-11-01 17:41:59 Well, been at Take 5 Oil Change for 15 minutes.... just one of the many lies I’ve been told in my life
3422 2018-11-01 17:41:53 Eggs, vegetable oil, splash of acid. Vomitous.
3423 2018-11-01 17:41:38 Get real! Ron Baron, Gene Munster, Ross @GerberKawasaki, Galileo Russel @Gfilche, @CathieDWood @cleantechnica, @ElectrekCo, @elonmusk + 100k investors incl. myself, saw it chrystal clear, while media, short sellers, big oil, legacy auto + NADA was all blinded by religious hate.
3424 2018-11-01 17:41:37 Need to stop touching my face at work, oil and grease embedded in my skin 
3425 2018-11-01 17:41:32 Not possible, she’s surely been knocked back countless times... not exactly an oil painting! 
3426 2018-11-01 17:41:26 Wrong. Brasilia is a city. The US is the world’s largest producer of soybeans and soy oil. Keep trying to hurt US farmers!
3427 2018-11-01 17:41:25 It’s an odd thing to be asked for an opinion on something not even tangentially related to anything I’ve ever talked about before. 

I don’t like to ignore those who reach out, but seriously what do you expect me to say? It’s like asking celebrity chef for a oil drilling tips.
3428 2018-11-01 17:41:24 I am not a fan of the GM. I'd hate to no longer be able to cheer for the team.
3429 2018-11-01 17:41:17 My late dad from Teesside, who ran oil rigs, would have frowned a little (man of few emotions until the blood drained from his lips), then suggested WD40, a "stick" and a bit of spit. Mam, an almost-Italian-married hairdresser (I was nearly Carlos) did the same with mi'hair.
3430 2018-11-01 17:40:59 Konki, Masta Oil Chafu  Maisha yanaenda kwa kasi sana ...
3431 2018-11-01 17:40:58 In Developing News: President ED Mnangagwa announces the discovery of oil and gas in Zimbabwe. The company to start mining in 2020. More to follow @tendaimadondo @fortunechasi @matigary @MthuliNcube @mmawere @daddyhope
3432 2018-11-01 17:40:55 All it would take to bring them to their knees is to impose sanctions on their oil.
3433 2018-11-01 17:40:48 Just drove past a Jiffy Lube that had a sign saying pumpkin spice oil changes are back!. LOL
3434 2018-11-01 17:40:46 Your leaving your roots. Looks good.
3435 2018-11-01 17:40:44 Rolling in high class this weekend.
3436 2018-11-01 17:40:40 Like the lamest oil Rumble, there's alternatives to Grown Fool to watch tomorrow. 

Shine 54 is on in the evening @WWNSHINE
Eve will be streaming a free show @ProWrestlingEVE
And there's a couple of #CatchWrestling events in UK I'll try to cover.

Watch those instead.
3437 2018-11-01 17:40:39 Are you for real? The oil that will reach Pakistan after 30 days is ordered today on today's pricepoint. Similarly, The oil that is available today was ordered on 30 days ago on thats day's pricepoint. So whats the takeaway? The decline in intl price will reflect after a month
3438 2018-11-01 17:40:37 Yup yup. Right mix of songs. Your head get oil
3439 2018-11-01 17:40:25 Are you looking for things like Killer Snails, Catan: Oil Springs, and Catan: Crop Trust? Would you consider Evolution and its variants to be scicomm? I love when COTS games have science underpinnings: people are more open to a game when it doesn't market as "educational".
3440 2018-11-01 17:40:12 プールとか入るとよくわからないけど凄まじい勢いで浮くよ。
3441 2018-11-01 17:40:06 Well I think the major point of contention between TX and CA, to get back to the original topic, is the regulatory differences. For example, if we adopted CA environmental regulations we risk our reservoirs, oil industry, and building projects. I think that's the point.
3442 2018-11-01 17:39:59 Any oil will work tbh. I just like coconut oil because I’m a witch now. 
Blessed be.
3443 2018-11-01 17:39:56 Prof your bitterness has completely clouded your judgement. Zimbabwe is still your home and for once please welcome positive developments. We have known for sometime that we have oil and gas deposits but whats new is that we taking steps towards harnesing  the resources
3444 2018-11-01 17:39:47 Signs of growing up: Topics of conversation at last nights halloween party included voting, the current oil market, and weather.
3445 2018-11-01 17:39:22 Unfortunately a lot snake oil salesmen would have nothing to sell if they relied on evidence that it actually did what it says it can do
3446 2018-11-01 17:39:18 TRAVEL: UPDATE: #Hawley: Northbound #A331 closed due to an accident involving a motorcyclist and oil spillage between the #M3 J4 #Camberley and the Blackwater Valley Road

3449 2018-11-01 17:38:47 Remember when that one oil company bought that oil spill cleanup company, and then the big oil spill happened?
3450 2018-11-01 17:38:45 Huge implications for the state, both positive and negative. Big tax revenue. Serious environmental implications - especially disposal of "produced water", which comes up with the oil.
3451 2018-11-01 17:38:18 Just put diesel gas in my car to substitute an oil change. 
3452 2018-11-01 17:38:16 We plugs, you wont find any of that in your liberal democratic party.
3453 2018-11-01 17:38:13 Baby oil is fire too.
3454 2018-11-01 17:38:11 That oil change lol.
3455 2018-11-01 17:37:59 If Venezuela didn't have oil they wouldn't be in the crisis they are today.
3456 2018-11-01 17:37:56 Use baby oil or coconut oil! So much better than the alternative.
3457 2018-11-01 17:37:54 Saudi economy is less than ½ the size of Canada’s with no other major source of funds than oil. Like Russia, it maintains the illusion of extreme wealth by enriching only a select few. Saudi's projected deficit for 2018 is $52 billion. They buy silence with weapon contracts.

3461 2018-11-01 17:37:36 No word from you about Venezuelan oil.

Jadi cleansing oil/milk - fw - toner - ( ss / moist )
3463 2018-11-01 17:37:33 So a whole President @edmnangagwa makes a $20mln oil and gas announcement. We are doomed folks.
3464 2018-11-01 17:37:31 Oooh good idea!!! My skins sore from trying so far  makeup remover, wipes, soap, exfoliator, baby oil, toothpaste, nail varnish remover & soaking in soap  I’ll let you know how it goes 
3465 2018-11-01 17:37:18 Why oil prices are plunging despite U.S. sanctions on Iran’s energy sector
3466 2018-11-01 17:37:10 A few things:

1) The donations they’re referring to is from environmentalist  @TomSteyer, founder of @NextGenAmerica

2) Curbelo has taken over $95,000 from the Big Sugar/oil & gas industries

3) His @LCVoters score is a sad 23%

4) Reporters have a duty to call out this BS

3468 2018-11-01 17:36:48 Ohhhh, in that case....can #EU expect a "waiver" from #USA about #Iran|ian Oil ? :")
3469 2018-11-01 17:36:46 I've had to oil them to keep them from chafing.
3470 2018-11-01 17:36:34 Okay, this gives me a bit more hope. We’re just mired in this debate here about who loves the oil industry more. And it’s infecting my outlook.
3471 2018-11-01 17:36:31 Ok, longed oil @ 63.50. I have no idea what I'm doing, but I've entered worse positions before. Plus, I killed it with silver this week so yolo.
3472 2018-11-01 17:36:13 I’m goin to get an oil change ASAP  I needed a car wash for like a month im finally getting one as we speak 
3473 2018-11-01 17:36:00 But Donald doesn’t mind being lied to by Saudi Arabia, they have lots of oil $$$$ and lying is his middle name anyway.
3474 2018-11-01 17:36:00 I'm in with a chance of winning a great prize with Carotino, the healthier cooking oil!
3475 2018-11-01 17:35:52 awwwww mane y’all killing chicks who need oil changes now?. Twitter not for the sensitive mane
3476 2018-11-01 17:35:46 Things I don’t like: NDX has run up to and pinned at resistance, SPX churning and has yet to exceed yesterday’s highs, Bond yields still heading downward, oil close to breaking support, Up/Dn Vol for NYSE ok, but not running away @todd_harrison @hmeisler @RevShark
3477 2018-11-01 17:35:46 I always bring lavender oil with me and put on my pillow for restful sleep. #luxtravelchat
3478 2018-11-01 17:35:45 I need more hours of sleep but my job + fitness goals prevents more than 7hrs. I will definitely add in some MCT oil and see if I can make the most out the 7hrs I get!!
3479 2018-11-01 17:35:44 "but daddy, they'll beat me up at school"
"so you're going to let big oil win?"
3480 2018-11-01 17:35:36 Thanks, cold start and sports exhaust. Got it back from the shop for annual service, oil, etc. Great day here about 70F, went for a ride.
3481 2018-11-01 17:35:26 As a disability advocate (and autist), I am not pleased even beyond the snake oil aspect.

Because many of those supposed indicators of deceit (the micro-gestures) are pretty common during conversation for people with autism and/or anxiety disorders when they're not lying at all.
3482 2018-11-01 17:35:25 Pasta, bro.

Sautéed mushrooms, spinach, and broccoli (in vegetable oil or butter)(I like butter better) 
Alfredo that shit, only a little tho, unless you're going for fat vegetarian, then slather that shit on there
Add [cooked] pasta, mix, and enjoy
Also add garlic or RIP
3483 2018-11-01 17:35:25 
3484 2018-11-01 17:35:21 You do realize that OK. has the oil and gas industry to thank.
If it wasn't for the bread and butter of the oil and gas OK. would be broke.
Engineers, welders, rig operator's, etc. would be out of work and this state would fold.
3485 2018-11-01 17:35:18 .@JonSallet: Brandeis thought Congress should consider political goals in developing antitrust laws, but Congress had to translate those goals into economic goals. Points to Brandeis's draft legislation after Std Oil that focused on economic outcomes and presumption.#FTCHearings

Not oil you but stop you from shaving for the rest of the month

Love you with a beard xxxxx
3489 2018-11-01 17:34:34 you’re asking the the PC party to fix the economy and debt situation that they caused when they were in power.

3496 2018-11-01 17:34:07 I can't help but notice the demands against Google fails to mention their slights against privacy and human rights.

Wonder if that's exactly why they (and Facebook/Twitter) fill their halls with "woke" people who don't care as long as trans rights and stuff.

3498 2018-11-01 17:34:01 It may have been local demand, because during July-August they burn a lot more crude oil for power to meet extra air con demand
3499 2018-11-01 17:34:00 I read a news story a few weeks ago about someone putting lavender oil in their litter boxes and making cats sick and one died. It made me so angry.

3519 2018-11-01 17:32:25 Sanctions need to be incrementally increased until their aim is achieved, not just 'maintained'. The Russian economy adapted to the existing sanctions and is doing quite well, especially with growing oil prices.

3522 2018-11-01 17:31:59 What's not sustainable is surviving off payments from oil companies that are going to dry up and destroying your environment, causing flooding year after year, hurting the fishing industry...

Literally unsustainable.
3523 2018-11-01 17:31:54 @BizNasty2point0 @ryanwhitney6 @spittinchiclets hey guys, huge fan of the show, haven’t missed a episode yet. What’s the website you use for the CBD oil? And wondering there’s a promo code for it
3524 2018-11-01 17:31:52 @Flipkart Order ID OD113610207776451000, Ordered 3 quantity of Ondoliva Extra Virgin Olive Oil, delivered only single product. On making complaint we have received refund against only one product and that too after deducting the courier charges. Very frustrating. Very bad.

But I apply the Noble Body face oil afterwards which has helped my dry skin tremendously.

3546 2018-11-01 17:30:05 Exactly. I'm sure that any credit union would be willing to give a decent loan and all the maintenance is done so not much to worry about other than oil changes until it hits about 100k miles.

In the last three years, N58 has been added to the price of fuel with steady rise in the price crude oil.The failures of this government ....

3556 2018-11-01 17:29:09 There is a running joke amongst a few of my Canadian friends asking if we could enforce the Annexation Bill of 1866. Also, Canadians tend to know our amthem better than the average American due to all of our NHL/CHL games. Easy way for Trudeau to get rid of oil industry too, lol.

3601 2018-11-01 17:25:25 There’s something in the crude oil that makes it so you have to go a mile for them just to hope to get an inch back.

3612 2018-11-01 17:24:46 At some point txlege may have to target oil revenue by eliminating some of those tax breaks and indirect subsidies you claim to be bothered about. Could also dip into rainy day fund.
3613 2018-11-01 17:24:42 In theory, yes. Although you might not see the result of this decline in crude oil immediately - say if you were to stop at the pump today.

3670 2018-11-01 17:19:25 Looks like oil was around $61 at beginning of 2018. All AmRoys were miles higher back then than they are now. Either retail has been selling them big-time last month or two or the market expects much lower oil prices in the near future.

3698 2018-11-01 17:17:00 Sad part of being an adult: getting overly excited about getting a oil change because you just got paid
3699 2018-11-01 17:16:56 i need to pack, clean, get my oil changed, do laundry, and put air in my tires, but i’m laying in bed with my cats instead.
3700 2018-11-01 17:16:41 Oil price now down 10% from recent high so perhaps a price reduction at the pumps is due soon, especially if Sterling continues to recover against the Dollar?
3701 2018-11-01 17:16:31 Let us hope said situation keeps the Oilers from even considering making such a move.

3705 2018-11-01 17:16:08 We're operating on a deficit but we spend half a trillion on the military budget just to have troops occupy countries where oil is big all because big corps spend millions on lobbying and "donate to political campaign funds...okay buddy that sure seems like a non profit
3706 2018-11-01 17:16:01 10 years ago we were worried about running out of oil. Now, even amidst geopolitical uncertainties, the world seems to be awash with oil. What's this technological revolution in unconventional oil/gas recovery? @StanfordEarth's Sally Benson asks panelists at #StanfordGEF
3707 2018-11-01 17:15:51 Suddenly we will be expecting fuel prices & gas prices to go down to cents overnight and promises of employment in the sector. After 5 years we will  wonder what happened to the oil, & employment and yet they hear that Zim has joined OPEC. Then we will discover another mineral

3710 2018-11-01 17:15:35 While Scotland may be resource-rich, you are still to demonstrate a case for profitably exploiting that resource and, while you might moan about prior mis-management of oil, any argument that requires a time-machine to set up an oil-fund isn't that feasible.

3712 2018-11-01 17:15:03 YUP.. when sells/sales go down that signals less demand, which always lowere the price. ALSO the Saudis are (or are threatening) to provide more oil to mrkts, also a price killer. Add in backdoor sales by Russia and Iraq and the Oil (out of which gas is refined) goes down more

3742 2018-11-01 17:11:59 Tell us something new, related to you portfolio. Like why are companies like CNQ shutting in 50,000 boe of oil a day because of lack of market access. You asleep at the wheel you should be meeting with that company.
3743 2018-11-01 17:11:57 I'm saying armies are specifically for defending borders, not guarding opium fields in Afghanistan, or oil fields in Iraq, or bombing Vietnamese rice farmers in some far flung part of the world. The "National Guard" even has their purpose right in their name.

3745 2018-11-01 17:11:55 If you're older than 40, stop wasting your breath telling 20 somethings about CBD oil. I promise we probably knew about it back when you considered cannabis to be of the devil.
3746 2018-11-01 17:11:52 @AlexwilliamsNYC Your NYT article on CBD had a few things that aren’t correct. CBD is derived primarily from hemp. CBD oil is made by pressing the stalk and branches.  The statement that it is flavorless is wrong. There is a taste that I can only describe as swamp water. @nytimes

3757 2018-11-01 17:11:05 Nigerians already from time past know that @NNPCgroup oil activities are fraudulent to date.

3776 2018-11-01 17:09:24 oil analysts say that even after the sanctions go into effect, Iran will most likely sell at least one million barrels of crude oil a day — a sharp decline from last year but perhaps enough to sustain its economy and wait out Mr. Trump’s term.

3802 2018-11-01 17:07:30 Reasonable people would like bitumen oil to be refined and cleaned up before it is shipped to protect our streams and lakes, oceans  , towns and farms from leaks of the toxic "dilbit " slurry used presently to transport bitumen oil.
Is that unreasonable?

3806 2018-11-01 17:07:20 That’s not funny, tho.
3807 2018-11-01 17:07:18 The industry wants a guaranteed high paying job for life driven by unsustainable continued expansion and ever increasing demand for oil. That is unrealistic. Peak demand is likely upon us and will demand will decline as electrification accelerates

(And Norway is so high because they have an extra 51% tax on oil profits ) which is a basic thing if you are properly looking at this stuff!
3825 2018-11-01 17:05:17 Works should start to move quickly now.
Expecting a busy site over next couple of weeks and plenty of oil flow before Christmas.

Vaccines are put out just as these childhood diseases are disappearing; health officials were shocked at measles vaccine.

3846 2018-11-01 17:03:46 Recently I was in SK heading  to  NS from Edmonton. SK is flat as you know, I saw tankers, km’s long trains of tankers heading east. It saddened me to see the risk we must take to get AB oil to our refineries and ports.
3847 2018-11-01 17:03:40 I was wondering why I didn't need my oil changed as frequently, then it hit me: I ain't gotta drive an extra 50 miles every other day to see some broke ass dude anymore lmfao.

3951 2018-11-01 16:53:29 Oooof this happened to me last year. An oil change became four new tires and some other fixes. A bill for $50 became an $800 bill RULL FAST.
3952 2018-11-01 16:53:28 I gotta do an oil change and I’m so fucking lazy to go
3953 2018-11-01 16:53:21 So the Iran sanctions set by Trump. The deadline is this Sunday after which time Iranian oil exports are supposed to be zero.  Did you know this before my tweet?

3956 2018-11-01 16:52:47 Nigerians don't be fooled by anyone telling you they can crash Petrolium price within some few months. Let them show us the maths. We understood ARITHMETICs. They refused to let the refineries work for 16 yrs. It will start working again in few months. Dangote oil will join 2020.
3957 2018-11-01 16:52:46 Speech to tweet — We got more Lithium Ion containment units! The actual units themselves can be engineered to handle different energy sources to pass through them simultaneously and this will DEFINITELY make things smoother on my end—

I still think the oil tank—SHUT UP PIETER

3962 2018-11-01 16:52:09 Unfortunately WWF funds bushmeet for lunch during workshops and meetings in places they work. Poor used oil in the forest!  please your actions on the field are even more important than what you tell the public!
3963 2018-11-01 16:52:08 Also since we control what comes in and out of our ports we also control how many oil tankers are allowed in. And from what I have heard their are dozens sitting out in the ocean waiting to come into port. Imagine if all were allowed in the price of gas would go way down.
3964 2018-11-01 16:52:06 Wait. So you guys expect me to get an annual oil change, new tires, premium gas, clean the car both internally AND externally!?

Def too much dip on your chip
3965 2018-11-01 16:52:06 They got just as far as you have!  Courts overturned Northern Gateway, just like TMX.  However, then that great supporter of Alberta PMJT sealed the deal by putting a moratorium on oil tanker traffic from where NG would have shipped to.

3967 2018-11-01 16:52:03 Voice of reason. EU members have all sold their birth rights in exchange for oil money from the middle East. I'm glad some European Politicians are not buying the bullshit.

3978 2018-11-01 16:50:57 You seem to think like most nats that Scotland only receives 8% of oil revenue, it doesn't. The term 'geographical share' may be beyond you so I suggest you get an adult to explain it to you.
3979 2018-11-01 16:50:57 I just wanna know how Toyota knows when I need my oil changed. HOW YOU KNOW I’m at 10k in less than 4 months, hmmm????
3980 2018-11-01 16:50:52 I add soy paprika cayenne and sesame oil maybe a spot of sweet chilli sauce then in the oven till their crisp and crunchy.

3985 2018-11-01 16:50:09 There is are current planned expansions, so you can’t include that in your thesis.
As well, production right now is not increasing anywhere near the % it could be. 
A strong oil sector has forward project planning, expansions, a proper transportation plan, rising employment, etc.

3990 2018-11-01 16:49:50 A whole prez announcing discovery of oil n gas ,where is the Min of Energy at?  He travels almost everywhere signing trade deals but therr is a min of trade n foreign affairs.A whole prez being his own cabinet 
3991 2018-11-01 16:49:44 The 0.6 is based on no deal, so a flatline growth. We will be passing on the increased costs to ensure no loss of profits. 
Well some our could take 5 years, so I can see your point. 

The biggest 2 issues, 
Uncertainty.
The rise of PPI due to oil costs, that effects everyone.
3992 2018-11-01 16:49:42 That is why hemp-based CBD oil is much more effective. I only buy from a small company in Colorado run by two women who grow the hemp and extract it themselves (& have done so for years). I know that oil is effective because, to my shock, it got rid of a huge cyst on my cat.

1 tbsp coconut oil
Oregano and salt to taste

1. Boil potatoes until soft enough to easily stick a fork through.
2. Drain and mash them in the pot. Add all other ingredients.
3. Salt and herbs to taste.
3996 2018-11-01 16:49:37 I was floored when I first, as a child, saw a documentary where a vaunted conceptual artist came up with the idea of oil painted portraits on the reverse of death mask molds and then just passed it off to an assistant, who began the process of actual creation
3997 2018-11-01 16:49:37 To me it's more like oil and a beautiful, peaceful meadow...that the oil smothers and pollutes for generations to come.

4002 2018-11-01 16:48:44 I read somewhere the Zambezi basin oil deposits were 'discovered' way before Independence. Mobil was in Muzarabani in the early 1950s. Is this not old news ? And what have they been doing with it all along then ?
4003 2018-11-01 16:48:43 That sounds wonderful. Did you grow them?

4014 2018-11-01 16:47:32 You britnats are very found of talking around an issue, but never actually dealing with presented facts, or reality - why is that? Is it because the facts don't suit your argument?
The whole UK imports oil - doesn't change the fact that 100% of oil income is more than 8%.

4015 2018-11-01 16:47:23 So if profit, expansion and high production do not equal a strong oil sector what does?

4056 2018-11-01 16:44:15 I gained weight & had to reduce my calorie intake!

That's mainly due to using more oil for cooking from scratch & eating more nuts. I've cut right back on that and have more beans, lentils, grains, etc. I'm now back in the healthy BMI range.

My digestion is hugely improved too!

4071 2018-11-01 16:42:02 Actually the US only gets about 8% of it's oil from the ME, the rest comes from The US, Canada, and Mexico and by 2022 the US will be the largest producer of oil in the world ..... vehicles like that keep us dependent on the BIG OIL companies !!!
4072 2018-11-01 16:41:58 It's not about whether trickle down works or not - it's about messaging, and who will buy their snake oil (and keep voting for them even when it's not in their own interests)

4086 2018-11-01 16:40:18 o "estranho" é que ao bater os R$28 o oil já estava derretendo ...

que bom, pelo menos "não é nada novo", hehehe ;)
4087 2018-11-01 16:40:12 Is this what you really think. If so, why do you support oil sands production and pipelines. Hypocrite!
4088 2018-11-01 16:40:06 ああ、これはまずい。実にまずい。0.1トン超えたよ。
4089 2018-11-01 16:40:05 @ 30 USD these fellows squandered the bonanza.Extorted Trillions by imposing back breaking additional levies.When questions are raised peddle oil bond nonsense.
4090 2018-11-01 16:39:59 Yeah I did the same.

This just ends up hurting people that are struggling the most whilst making @PicknPay a pretty penny. I think they have profit in mind not fair distribution of oil.
4091 2018-11-01 16:39:57 Trump is only seeing the color of the skin and feeding that to his base to stir up chaos. Without mass chaos, there is no way to control his base and they may actually realize the snake oil salesman that he truly is. Bottom line on Trump, everything NEEDS to be about him and ego!
4092 2018-11-01 16:39:42 If I was a man honey I would’ve graduated high school and went to the oil field 
4093 2018-11-01 16:39:40 Rather palmolein oil, cheers !
4094 2018-11-01 16:39:36 Just coconut and forgot one the other one was peppermint or was it eucalyptus oil forgot just mix it together lol

Roasted yam + Red oil

4096 2018-11-01 16:39:11 You got it wrong. Hawley reality is he was running a scam since he entered officeTurnouts he had Washington political& lobbiest hacks running his campaign out of the Missouri Attorney General office.He owes these people oil co big Pharma mergers.Who else Not Missouri for sure
4097 2018-11-01 16:39:09 !!! they do have those essential oil ones!!!
4098 2018-11-01 16:39:03 Sea salt/pecan sweet potatoes. Cut 'em up into 1/4" 1/4 slices, 1/4 cup maple syrup, 1/2 tsp sea salt, 1/4 tsp black pepper, 1/4 cup crushed pecans, 2 TBsp veg oil. Mix it all together then in a greased 9x13 pan or pyrex, 425 ~30 min stir halfway. Top with a lil sea salt.
4099 2018-11-01 16:38:53 Or.... we could just get it to the Gulf. Americans don’t pay in funny money. And they are buying heavy oil from Mexico at a premium.
4100 2018-11-01 16:38:45 @realDonaldTrump Instead of being a coward and not having true leadership skills, a real President would travel to these countries where these folks are being terrorized and solve the problems. Oh wait they have no oil. So screw them and put our Military on DEFCON V
4101 2018-11-01 16:38:34 I feel like that might sting a little.
4102 2018-11-01 16:38:33 Maybe direct your fear and anger at the GOVERNMENT of south America ! what no oil to have a WAR over like Iraq & Afghanistan where our government claimed to be helping the people ! No it was all about money as always.
4103 2018-11-01 16:38:33 I'm sure you believe that along with exporting water etc. UK imports majority of it's gas and one large chunk of it's oil from other countries (not Scotland). If you don't like things, have a referendum...oh wait you did...how did that turn out for you?
4104 2018-11-01 16:38:26 $8 bottle of coconut or olive oil would prob do the same
4105 2018-11-01 16:38:22 If only the Fed's would push "renewable" energy forms we would stir the economy, generate more jobs and help clean the atmosphere. I'm not talking about "no oil" just some kind of pathway to ween off oil products for the future of the planet and our kids, kids..
4106 2018-11-01 16:38:18 That's why I only buy CBD oil from 2 women I know who grow the hemp and make the oil themselves. (A labor of love, they often donate to those who are ill & broke.) My cat had a huge cyst on her back emanating heat. 2 weeks of their CBD oil 2x/day & the cyst is gone completely.
4107 2018-11-01 16:38:13 Data is the great resource Not crude oil....
4108 2018-11-01 16:38:10 Bought an oil change for my car.. why does it hold 5.7 quarts rather than 5 or 6 
4109 2018-11-01 16:38:08 @edmnangagwa @MoHCCZim gas and oil discovered makorokoto. AIDS cure discovered?  Totii? Ukaona pasingadyiki mari Hon President  ( that's a big shame to our country)
4110 2018-11-01 16:38:05 Really wanted to go shopping today, instead my car got fixed, going to get an oil change and then buy winter tires. #Adulting 
4111 2018-11-01 16:38:03 Can someone change my oil please and I’ll buy you food !

4115 2018-11-01 16:37:39 Donald Trump has spent his ENTIRE life honing his ‘snake oil salesmen’ skills. Constant bait and switch behavior that, with the help of other slimy dudes and Russians, managed to squeak his way into the WH. 

He’s a natural Jim Jones, David Koresh, Warren Jeffs but dumber.
4116 2018-11-01 16:37:30 When y’all niggas gonna stop telling us to get an oil change and start changing our oil?

4126 2018-11-01 16:36:52 Oh yes, I have a lovely electric oil radiator that keeps my hut lovely and warm. A beautiful rug on the floor and carpet. Double glazing and inoculation in the walls. Just need to to do the ceiling (probably next week.

4138 2018-11-01 16:36:09 Lmfao - I guarantee u have never stepped foot in the oil patch. I’ve worked and lived in it. 

Jobs, wages, and production have all increased. While keeping the environment safe, now I know the MSM will tell you no, but the oil industry is safer than ever,whether u like it or not

4142 2018-11-01 16:35:47 They discovered oil and gas in Northern Cape but gov is delaying exploration
4143 2018-11-01 16:35:40 Lets at least be realistic here. 

The Saudis keep the oil taps open for us. They also crush as much western opposition as possible.

All the while stabbing us in the back every chance they get. To this point, being friends with them for resources has outweighed their awfulness.
4144 2018-11-01 16:35:38 MPL and Coconut oil?
4145 2018-11-01 16:35:33 If you’re going to compare countries with tiny almost all white populations, then you should compare Norway with Switzerland. Still unfair since Norway struck gold with massive oil reserves, most per capita in the world. But Switzerland is rated 4th most capitalist in the world.
4146 2018-11-01 16:35:31 Thanks my sweet Penelope,  My mom tells me that I look like George Clooney with my sexy gray hair. And for my tousled fur she puts me Coconut oil, but I always have a punk look

copy what worked in MN, the states are so similar, 

1-tax the top 2%
2-invest in roads & schools
3-don't vote for snake oil salesman after snake oil salesman.

Trickle down is a scam.
4151 2018-11-01 16:34:48 That's correct Paula. Our bars do not contain any Palm oil. 
4152 2018-11-01 16:34:42 I need to run by Bath and Body Works after work, so I can buy Christmas-y wallflowers. I’ve already started with the peppermint oil in my diffuser this morning.
4153 2018-11-01 16:34:41 When you call the auto shop and tell them you need oil and they say oh is this Madison? Lol yupppp it’s me again 
4154 2018-11-01 16:34:26 The price of oil is dropping but consumers are not seeing relief at the pump
4155 2018-11-01 16:34:18 Use olive oil as a conditioner by leaving it warmed up on your hair for 15 minutes before shampoo.
4156 2018-11-01 16:33:51 All horrible companies. #Nestle is killing gorillas w/ palm oil production; #walmart... well we all know that shitshow...
4157 2018-11-01 16:33:46 The idea was to alow down horders but it hurts the people who dont have $15 but need cooking oil.
Its sad really.
Last time i had to help a guy out by combining his groceriea and mine just to get to $15 so he could get cooking oil for his family.
4158 2018-11-01 16:33:45 You see, you start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it

4162 2018-11-01 16:33:34 Yep. It’s time to accept that opponents to the oil sands have fully won. Congratulations to them, to Saudi Arabia, to United States consumers, etc. As for Canadians, and especially Albertans and Saskatchewanians (or whatever you call yourselves), too bad I guess. :/

4210 2018-11-01 16:30:26 Yes one would think this doesn’t obey the laws or supply and demand but you are missing half the picture. Heavy oil selling at a ***premium*** in places Canadian oil can’t get to, and at a discount in places it can get to. Because of lack of pipelines. Some markets oversupplied.
4211 2018-11-01 16:30:13 @ProfOsinbajo l appreciate the infrastructural and social investments by ur govt but it's very important to acknowledge that the recession has left a dent on the psyche of our people.
The rising oil price gives an opportunity for a downward review of the pump price of petrol.

I have received your care package of cured woodchuck elbows and fresh batch of Squirrel Oil — which has helped my sidearm function tremendously. There will be no battle this week. The men get a much earned rest. We all are in good spirits. I miss you.

4222 2018-11-01 16:28:56 I guess what confuses me is why anyone should avoid federal taxes, obviously I pay waaaaay more fed than state taxes per month. Yeah my sister who lives in Alaska has no state tax but their stuff is so much more expensive and they have oil lol.

4258 2018-11-01 16:25:24 You haven't shown anything really. 

The industry is raking it in. They are not hiring as much as you may like because they have automated and outsourced and the construction phase of the oil sands is mostly over. Production is at record highs. That is an inescapable fact.
4259 2018-11-01 16:25:22 Forgot I had an oil change today and I never cleaned my car out.. #oops
4260 2018-11-01 16:25:09 I just did a gargle of a mixture of tea tree oil, lemon oil, and oregano oil to clear my throat out from unwanted microbes and it was disgusting. Low key almost threw up  Did this at work and most of my coworkers did it as well.... only one wasn’t able to keep it in

4262 2018-11-01 16:25:04 IIRC just before SCW started Syrian oil production (which was in long-term decline) was similar to Syrian oil demand, so at that point (before SCW wrecked a lot of oil production infrastructure) Syria was already on the brink of becoming a net oil importer.
4263 2018-11-01 16:24:54 Yes! I have 3 of the 10 listed on my shelf:California,Colavita and Lucini...plus a Spainish finishing oil and Jet house brand oil that I love. Good to know your choices are my choices.
4264 2018-11-01 16:24:48 @edmnangagwa, this oil is ours too, we want to know terms of the deal and every detail proceeding to production of diesel. We also want to see estimated numbers and how much cheaper diesel will be for t locals.

4271 2018-11-01 16:24:19 You can see where they touch the water. And you can tell the bottom of the distant oil rig is above the closer one, indicating the horizon is further.

The horizon is distant, even though it's hazy. That line might be more accurate than you think if you've seen infrared footage.
4272 2018-11-01 16:24:10 I never agree with this crazy lady but I will say I do think the government should have its own Oil Company National Defense
4273 2018-11-01 16:24:09 They rolled back their rule on accepting money from fossil fuel corporations. There are a few Dem candidates running for office with oil corporation ownership like JB Pritzker- DNC candidate for Illinois Governor.

4326 2018-11-01 16:19:22 Going forward, all companies in oil & gas should submit a short & long term business plan for mgmt of residuals from exploration & extraction. They must be held responsible for cleaning up their mess after they’re done, not  taxpayers. Even kids know they must tidy up their mess.

4354 2018-11-01 16:16:46 Good news that oil and gas has been discoverd in Zim.Please Mr President  lets use the oil and gas as the Arabs do to develop the country and not to misuse the resourses as we did with the diamonds
4355 2018-11-01 16:16:43 Blah, blah, blah, oil company speak. They’ll just raise the price of fuel as soon as they can. Meanwhile... where is YOUR carbon plan? Thoughts and prayers we won’t suffer from global warming? Do you even have a plan? Someone has to pay the piper - but not your buddies huh?
4356 2018-11-01 16:16:38 Is he going to do circus? We are watching him take Shadad and Zaytoon oil on stage as medicine. But no thanks we have much better things to do..then watchjng him again.
4357 2018-11-01 16:16:31 Cooking oil?

4360 2018-11-01 16:16:26 Roasted pumpkin seeds:
Get the seeds, wash the seeds, boil the seeds (10 mins tops), mix oil & flavouring (the paler ones are just salt & pepper for the small one)
Mix seeds in flavoured oil, spread out on greaseproof paper on tray.
Cook at 180C/gas 4 for 10-15 mins / till crispy

4363 2018-11-01 16:16:20 Yet the Oil stocks not reacting to the WTI move this time around like in October.  Absorbed it quite well

4367 2018-11-01 16:16:13 Yes.  They should start with overhauling the grazing lease process.  Don't you agree?  A lot of oil and gas payments that should be going back to the province rather than leaseholders.  You have/had one of these leases, correct?
4368 2018-11-01 16:16:13 Exactly . But we have good signs . And the promoter was f cheap renewable energy is China . They are lowering the prices so much that oil as fuel will become obsolete .
4369 2018-11-01 16:16:03 Of course, but the oil and gas receipts are included in the y-axis.

4373 2018-11-01 16:15:29 The army that looted the diamonds at Chiadzwa is the gvt now. What different outcome shld we expect 4rm the oil fields?
4374 2018-11-01 16:15:24 Umm.. I have ALL 5 lol got an oil change last week, don’t need one til January, I’m a virgin so.... that should answer #2, more than $40 in my checking, savings, and CC’s, my eyebrows are very real, and I have a winter coat! 
4375 2018-11-01 16:15:24 A Country with Billions of dollars from Oil and also politicians with Jets should be ashamed they have money and this is an outrage to see this animal like it is the person in charge should be jailed nothing but bastards
4376 2018-11-01 16:15:19 Sitting in the waiting room ( getting an oil change ) high as fuck and watching a fish documentary by planet earth . Drinking a French roast . Life feels so good right this second

4378 2018-11-01 16:15:14 We just got rid of a snake oil salesman. We don't need another.
4379 2018-11-01 16:15:11 I still have enough facial oil to go around. You’re covered.
4380 2018-11-01 16:15:03 Crude oil's fall from $75 to $63.4 in a matter of 3 weeks levels has been startling. This could just save the Modi government in the short term
4381 2018-11-01 16:14:59 By the way, be sure to infuse the essential oil with a carrier oil like grapeseed oil, I get mine from Aldi and it works just fine.
4382 2018-11-01 16:14:58 Oh, thank God. I was worried. There is a woman in my class who ruined her car by going three years without an oil change, no one ever told her why it was important 
4383 2018-11-01 16:14:58 Change in pattern finally creeping in ?  Oil down $2 this morning and Cdn Oil stocks absorbed it quite well. My list is still up on the day. Suspect as soon as Oil makes it's key reversal low and rallies, we will get torque in the names on next leg. So far so good
4384 2018-11-01 16:14:51  joke of the year. Do u think Nigerians are stupid? What price will atiku crash? When you inherited the government in 1999 oil price was below 30naira & in 2015 it was 87 and during that time oil per barrel was more than $100. You won't get elected let alone crash oil price
4385 2018-11-01 16:14:48 You can say Oil of Every Pearl’s Un-Insides, it’s okay we’re all thinking it
4386 2018-11-01 16:14:35 There no problem. Poppi made of special alloy. No need for rust or oil.

4388 2018-11-01 16:14:22 The caddy van is leaking oil though. That's rubbish news to go with the good news about being involved in minor criminal shenanigans.

4397 2018-11-01 16:13:33 Overnight cues for the Bulls

*Crude Oil prices collapse 

*Strong Rupee appreciation 

*SGX Nifty up nearly +100 points
4398 2018-11-01 16:13:28 Brent is not even at the lows of August and this oversupply situation is becoming serious. I do believe in the long run oil will go up but in the short term I do not know anymore.
4399 2018-11-01 16:12:46 One positive on oil, if you can call it that, is it's finally oversold on the daily. Oil, like gold, never seems to be able to bottom unless it gets oversold.
4400 2018-11-01 16:12:41 If we didnt benefit from diamonds in Marange, what would make me think we wii benefit from oil?
4401 2018-11-01 16:12:40 I just want some good bread, olives, tzanziki, feta and halloumi cheese, cucumbers, tomatoes, olive oil, salt and red wine vinegar for lunch. A meze if you will. 
4402 2018-11-01 16:12:39 Who discovered the oil, who will extract it and who will benefit from it.
4403 2018-11-01 16:12:37 oil company: if you're from out east, why do you want to come back to Calgary????

4405 2018-11-01 16:12:33 1. We only grew 60,000mt of soya in 2017/18
2. The country is not exporting enough & RBZ is short of forex.
3. Once we are given adequate forex we can supply up to 3,000mt of oil and 2,000mt of soap. Our factory workers were at home the whole of October for our soap factory

4410 2018-11-01 16:12:18 Trump is the puppet of Putin. What he is doing is hurting US and pushing China toward Russia - Closer than ever. Quitting Iran deal and fallout with Saudi will surely raise the oil prices in the future, which will conveniently revives Russia's economy, need to say more?
4411 2018-11-01 16:12:16 Zimbabwe has discovered oil as reported by @BBCAfrica  is this the game changer for Southern Africa
4412 2018-11-01 16:12:11 Some people sef go pour anointing oil put ur top say u be witch
4413 2018-11-01 16:12:08 Hahahaha ukuzvifonera mdra, ZANU will never change it’s spots. The country will benefit nothing from that gas and oil.
4414 2018-11-01 16:12:00 Not every difference in calorie density is based on being "lite" - olive oil is almost 10x the calorie density of balsamic vinegar. Some people might prefer a 1:19 blend as much as a 1:1 blend, especially if they can have almost twice as much.
4415 2018-11-01 16:11:57 Oil and gas is... special.
4416 2018-11-01 16:11:53 My reading of Table 3 of the actual article suggests that you need 10x as much coconut oil fatty acids as DEET (in mg/cm^2) to repel mosquitoes.
4417 2018-11-01 16:11:35 I have a friend who takes Melatonin every night & she says she sleeps like a baby. No weird dreams/nightmares. My problem is with falling sleep. If I do, I can usually sleep 6-7 straight. I’ve been trying meditation/a regular sched./not eating-drinking b4 bed. CBD oil is next!

4429 2018-11-01 16:10:43 I don’t know why folks are shocked that Zim might have oil prospects(ie the Muzaraba i story). 

Those that studied geology will tell you that coal, natural gas, and diamonds, are all by-products of some geological process and in between that process oil is a by-product also.

Iranians know that the only people responsible for the current "forced" decline of the economy are ur foreign greencard Iranian agents who R homesick after they abandoned the sinking ship in 1979 & want to return & have a piece of the oil and gas left behind

When oil was at an all time low it took almost a year for fuel to drop in price - but when oil rose it took a month for fuel to go up! Why are you allowing us to be ripped off?

After all we have to have a constant supply of oil to keep the markets cool; otherwise it will be very tough on the part of the govt. to
4476 2018-11-01 16:06:35 R you serious?We definitely don’t have a diplomatic relations with israel (not even a diplomatic relations, we also don’t have any relations with them) & we don’t sell oil to israel.,months ago KSA has Donated more than 200M $ to palestine.

4489 2018-11-01 16:05:13 oil, oil, oil, oil OIL! This was predictable. Putin & Exxon been itching to get their hands on Venezuela, so military industrial complex will find a way! Wonder how much the uncontested-by-Mattis troop movmnt to the border plays into this new frontier of war? #logistics

4495 2018-11-01 16:04:58 In my opinion, libertarians values in government is commendable, Unfortunately you mostly take votes away from (R) @BrianKempGA. & the @realDonaldTrump agenda. 2% doesn't win. I hope you step down in the race. Insurance advocacy & lobbying CBD/cannabis/hemp oil is your calling.
4496 2018-11-01 16:04:56 When you live in a country where it’s difficult to get palm oil &and you can’t do without beans then you have no choice than to use groundnut oil.
4497 2018-11-01 16:04:55 Everyone (YPG, rebels, and Assad) were buying from ISIS.

Now, what oil production remains in Deir ez Zor is mostly controlled by YPG, which sells it at discount, but that discount is AFAIK much smaller than during ISIS rule.

4503 2018-11-01 16:04:26 You make a discovery and you already have the funds to invest but instead it takes you 2 years to set up. Why should they start earlier? Are they waiting for something to happen by 2020? Are they willing to take the risk in this investment?Is it really accurate that oil is there?
4504 2018-11-01 16:04:20 Very bearish outlook crude oil.

4553 2018-11-01 16:00:56 Haiwawo the words are

President Emmerson Mnangagwa has told a Press conference in Harare that Energy Invictus has discovered oil in Muzarabani.

The Australian firm is expected to invest $20 million to drill an exploration well by mid 2020
4554 2018-11-01 16:00:56 My fondness of the tweet has nothing to do with pet rock itself.  He could be talking about vanadium, oil or Apple.  It's about the emotional aspects to trading that resonated.

He did mention that my Jeep was amazingly clean, just wet! $$$ well spent not having to crawl under it and mess with the oil disposal.
4563 2018-11-01 16:00:27 Last week @EPA acting administration @EPAAWheeler spoke to the #Pennsylvania oil and gas industry.

4565 2018-11-01 16:00:24 I'm big into oil. I own lots of it and I know what it smells like. It's rich smelling. The smell itself spawns property and mansions.

4578 2018-11-01 15:59:37 It whitened my teeth SLIGHTLY. I used coconut oil and did it for about 10-15 mins first thing in the morning
4579 2018-11-01 15:59:37 Also prewar Syria was dependent on oil import the question to what extend?
4580 2018-11-01 15:59:35 I read that as "water + lava oil inhalations"
4581 2018-11-01 15:59:27 "Still, private owners of oil and gas in the Everglades have sought to exploit the underlying fossil fuels."   Who owns it?  And who the hell 'sold' it to them?
4582 2018-11-01 15:59:15 Yet Republicans went to war on innocent people and innocent kids for oil. This is sickening what trump is doing
4583 2018-11-01 15:59:11 Oct 31 police found a pipeline to siphon off oil for smuggling ring in Kirkuk There was a decided increase in reports of oil smuggling all across Iraq in October

4585 2018-11-01 15:58:50 The oil in the soup. Too much oil isn't good 
4586 2018-11-01 15:58:46 I think you mean speed humps, sir. As they are called in California. Lol.
4587 2018-11-01 15:58:39 Even if crude oil prices come down to $ 30 we will still pay above Rs 80
4588 2018-11-01 15:58:38 Start with a foreign policy not run by weapons manufacturers and the oil and gas industry. US continues to waste Trillions on banker wars
4589 2018-11-01 15:58:38 2019: @atiku Abubakar plans to reduce the pump price of petrol.

The current N145/L is a burden to we Nigerians, we claim to have oil but we pay through our nose to gain access to it. That is why Late President Musa Yar'Adua will continue to remain my best president!!

4595 2018-11-01 15:58:20 That's so awesome! I remember reading his stuff on HFboards during the 04-05 lockout, and then on @Lowetide and his own irreverent oil fans blog. Jeez that was long ago.
4596 2018-11-01 15:58:20 Custodian of inventory need not be beneficial owner of economic interest in it. Enron-style prepay contracts enable commodity investors to fund shadow #DarkInventory by lending $ & borrowing oil. Iran is using Dalian custody, possibly with a view to swapping oil for products
4597 2018-11-01 15:58:19 thanks for asking. Its okay to have the courage to ask for yourself BTW. Drive something other than a huge SUV or Pickup...convert  to less polluting fuel. I lived on an acreage 37 miles from my work in the 90's converted my truck to propane. I replaced oil furnace with propane..

4601 2018-11-01 15:58:00 Why would you think that? Venezuela has 20% of the world's oil reserves. Attacking & murdering brown people so we can exploit their natural resources IS the American way. 
4602 2018-11-01 15:57:59 Reaper, I grew up in OK. My girlfriends and I used to come to TX to have fun. Texas was all America: cowboys, oil drilling, rodeos, country music. Even Texas has changed. H1B1 Visas were used in Texas, and Rick Perry offered scholarships to those here illegally. Still ahead.
4603 2018-11-01 15:57:55 You pretend like there's something going that no one knows about except you and then refuse to tell us what it is, but keep insisting somehow that Iraq's rise in oil exports is a symptom of Iranian oil in Iraq, when infact Iraq closed off oil from Iran abide by sanctions.
4604 2018-11-01 15:57:52 £950million, over 3 yrs, (MAYBE)! How much profit did Scotland's oil , make in first quarter. Tory lies again

And if it's true that's great news toda vanhu vari honest uko kwete mbavha

4625 2018-11-01 15:56:18 What surprised me in this announcement is there is another company that did its exploration and found this oil, then the gvt is now announcing itself that there is oil. If prophet Magaya says I have discovered HIV cure then its crime and is arrested. What a shame in policies then

4633 2018-11-01 15:55:10 @narendramodi @PMOIndia @arunjaitley Sir, As on 4.10.2018 Crude oil price was 5487.00 and Diesel price was 80.10 after that Rs 5 was reduced by Central and State Govt. Now, as on 31.10.2018, Crude oil price is 4873.00 but Diesel price is Rs 77+.where is the reduction disappeared.
4634 2018-11-01 15:55:06 BP is reaping a big profit from the cheapest Canadian oil on record
Oil giant is running its refineries at hardest rate in 15 years to snap up all that cheap Canadian oil . Yet Eastern Canada still forced to import FULL PRICED oil from other countries. #theworldlaughsatus
4635 2018-11-01 15:54:59 Can confirm. We have stripped a pan down completely and flaxseed oil is the very very best coating there is. It is, however, very stinky.

4659 2018-11-01 15:53:49 The #BoE Quarterly Inflation Report exercises an unrealistic reliance on ultra-low oil prices in CPI forecast. BoE assumes 3 yr forecast horizon will see a full 1% increase in wages, yet CPI falls by 0.5%. Is that so? Oil would need to fall below $35 WTI.Not likely or reasonable.
4660 2018-11-01 15:53:44 What is Canada & Alberta doing to have these Oil Companies clean up this multi-billion dollar raping of our environment now & not to just leaving it to the taxpayers to clean up this horrific damage - @cathmckenna @RachelNotley @JustinTrudeau Why have Govt's Allowed this ???

4664 2018-11-01 15:53:30 So it uses oil but such a tiny amount it makes the added fat almost negligible, right? Or is it still kinda fatty? I need to read up a bit more but I know it’s healthier than actual frying

4713 2018-11-01 15:50:33 I had an energy audit Tuesday.  I'm putting in a high efficiency boiler.  The cost would be prohibitive for most people.  Converting to electric heat was beyond my means.  The gas boiler isn't partly because of Canada subsidizing big oil indirectly and directly $34B annually.
4714 2018-11-01 15:50:26 Is the a Trump rescue plan....oh, no. Gave green light to Saudis to let the flood of oil rise before election.

4764 2018-11-01 15:47:22 But just the breaking of the coconut, scrapping, freezing and all tires me  but I think carrot oil is quite easy too. Get your carrots, peel, blend and cook on low steam with olive or coconut oil... the carrot oil simmers on top
4765 2018-11-01 15:47:20 Ohhh I totally know that feeling! Let me know what you think of your Soothe oil when you get it! Not only is it even more beautiful in person but it smells SO good!!  
4766 2018-11-01 15:47:19 It really depends on the oil you’re using. Every 3k used to be recommended but realistically every 7.5k or so is a good time. I think they used to say 3k just to get you to spend your money every 3 months.
4767 2018-11-01 15:47:15 Best! It’s the dupe for too faced better than sex waterproof mascara. Memang susah remove sebab waterproof kena guna oil based remover

Those would get shut down aka people lose jobs but Only a selected few will still work. So if you’re young & U suck, I’d worry.

4843 2018-11-01 15:41:53 We always "discover" oil. Nothing ever comes of it.
4844 2018-11-01 15:41:34 Once hydrocarbons is discovered, it is easy now to discover where there is oil. There are special tools that are used that can detect where the drilling machines can be located.
4845 2018-11-01 15:41:33 Okay, I get what you meant by this. Got it now sir. Buy oil, (tankers full if you could). Have heard entire series of Sermons stating that "our" church understands the oil, has the oil, and are one of the very few who are prepared. Inference was, watch the others miss the boat.
4846 2018-11-01 15:41:32 Put #solar and other renewable / efficient energy on equal footing with oil & gas by exempting these investments from the passive activity loss limitation rules (like O&G has been for decades).
4847 2018-11-01 15:41:30 Not all AAU, prep and HS coaches are bad. The problem is the widespread corruption has incentivised this type of behavior. I am proud that the FBI is drilling down on the "under the table" crowd. To borrow an oil and gas term, I believe this won't be a "Dry hole".

4930 2018-11-01 15:35:23 The Iranians exported 1.6 mil barrels of oil in Sept --most experts agree that number will not fall to zero -many think they will be able to export 1-1.2 mil -the US and OPEC have more than made up that difference ---This move in oil is not about equities -its about supply #OOTT

OPEC and partners have been listening to Trump’s calls for increased production.
Correlation:
If oil prices increase after mid term elections in US, it means hypothesis has some truth to it.

4935 2018-11-01 15:35:05 So are we ready to sacrifice all the comfort originating from keeping these countries in darkness. Are we prepared to consume less oil? Eat a bar of chocolate only once a week, so perhaps children in the coca owner countries could have a slice once a month?

4958 2018-11-01 15:33:53 Oil prices have decided to fall faster than when they went up earlier in the year. But I would be very sceptical of a sustained fall of NYMEX crude below 60. With shale being the new marginal producer, 60 becomes a floor to prices.
4959 2018-11-01 15:33:51 But as I told my delinquent Donald, America doesn't own the world, dear. If Iran sells oil to people who want it, it's none of your business. You just keep selling your weapons to people Iran doesn't want you to sell to and everyone is happy.
4960 2018-11-01 15:33:48 Oil discovered in muzarabani. Good news but remember we become poorer after discovery of diamond in marange. Let's be wiser and leave something for our future generations.

4968 2018-11-01 15:33:17 I guess you want to pay more at the gas pump because Beto is for raising the price on a barrel of oil..and I guess you want to pay more taxes, which means businesses will have to raise their prices and lower their wages so u will pay more in the store etc...

5050 2018-11-01 15:26:52 As if things could not go any lower, Zimbabwe has found oil. Now the resource curse will hit us big time. That oil will leave us worse off. Worse than where the diamonds left us.
5051 2018-11-01 15:26:48 OIL & GAS - Zimbabwe.  Never put your hand out to restrain or guide feeding lions.
5052 2018-11-01 15:26:46 @JohnGormleyShow everyone is raving about oil moving by train, what is going to happen to all the grain sitting on farms that needs to get to port and the waiting ships?  I’d like to know how the railways are going to handle it?

5057 2018-11-01 15:26:07 Tell us exactly what you will do to crash the price as you said not just promise, we want details, will you continue with subsidy or deregulate the oil industry as a hole ?
5058 2018-11-01 15:26:05 Those things smell so bad though... but that does remind me, I want to get some of those little oil air freshener things you plug into the wall... It's time for some apple pie.

5060 2018-11-01 15:25:56 Pence is a slick one.  Not trustworthy at all.
Trump is a grifter, plain and simple.  If it were 1898, he'd be a snake oil salesman.
Trump will do whatever he has to do to do make cash flow.
And his emotional failure is that he will never ever ever ever take responsibility...

5065 2018-11-01 15:25:35 Women and men have different interests and are represented differently in fields of work. Oil rig workers for example get hazard pay and there are hardly any women in that field of work. It's a myth.
5066 2018-11-01 15:25:24 Ghana has almost constant eletricity. And they don't have generators. Nigeria has the highest use of generators plus is the biggest oil exporting country in Africa but ain't got electricity. Lol think about it. NIGERIA is the 8th oil exporter in the world but ain't got light.
5067 2018-11-01 15:25:23 But it's not simple. Various dems have also taken millions of dollars from oil and gas, have openly supported fracking and burning coal, suing the EPA and further deregulating energy. You can't prop up these industries and claim to be fighting climate change at the same time
5068 2018-11-01 15:25:08 There is such a thing called collective responsibility. It's not the type of responsibility that warrants prosecution, but it does warrant speaking out about it and taking action. The fact that oil companies (a minority of humanity) play a big role in damaging the environment, ..

5073 2018-11-01 15:24:33 And if you think about it, it was white people who supplied the tech to make oil from coal. And it was them that built it and kept it going, and still do. 
All the good that was built is being destroyed in the name of RET and racial BBEE

5107 2018-11-01 15:22:11 Australians have discovered oil in Mashonaland Central province of Zimbabwe. 

Mnangagwa must thank them for their efforts and tell them that a state-owned entity will take it from here.
5108 2018-11-01 15:22:08 Purely based on our record in the diamond, platinum & gold space it is wisest to have politicians far away from the oil & gas discoveries. A tender vetted by parliament must decide who sets foot in Muzarabani. We became poorer after discovering diamonds bt politicians became rich

5182 2018-11-01 15:14:40 Part on grains is good, but real problem these days IMHO, is PUFA seed oils. Corn oil (and others) raise inflammation and can actually change the way cells react to insulin. Additionally, they don't trigger as strong of a satiety response as animal fats, so ppl don't stop eating.

5194 2018-11-01 15:13:39 Listen to what Papa is saying... Obama was using the DOJ to spy on him and a close ally using a FISA... likely with the assistance of UK & Aus assets.  That ally... Israel and their recent discovery of oil reserves.

5207 2018-11-01 15:12:36 Can @OKZimbabwe please look into the goings on at OK Kuwadzana 2. Staff there r taking commodities out thru back door. They have people queing fr c/oil for hrs on end. And this is on top of their bad service
5208 2018-11-01 15:12:35 Zimbabwe discovers oil. President Emmerson Mnangagwa has announced the discovery of oil in Muzarabani in the north of the country. He said that these are still early days and an exploration well will be sunk in 2020.

Usually I do not argue with ignorant ppl, but u plz compare inflation then n now n see what improvement hv happened, there is a long list...
5212 2018-11-01 15:12:15 I'm not saying it comes down to short term profits vs long term economic  sustainability & prosperity, but if it did would you @PremierScottMoe be willing to change your tune on GHG emissions and oil industry subsidies?
5213 2018-11-01 15:12:07 CBD vape oil is the Cool Mom of drugs
5214 2018-11-01 15:11:56 Zimbabwe discovered diamonds years ago, but nothing tangible was achieved with them. Not even a cm of tarred road, a rural clinic or even a borehole! We hope the oil will bring socio-economic transformation to the country!
5215 2018-11-01 15:11:48 Any of my followers used CBD oil for a period of time?
5216 2018-11-01 15:11:46 Tried to go and get an oil change and realized I left my wallet at home 
5217 2018-11-01 15:11:44 That side e cooking oil is always boiling....
No rest at all....
5218 2018-11-01 15:11:35 Hmmmm Notley appointed an anti pipeline, anti oil sands activist to a comity that over sees oil sand development. She supports LEAP therefore so does Notely.

5220 2018-11-01 15:11:28 Has anyone ever gotten their oil change and not ran into an additional cost?
5221 2018-11-01 15:11:21 I'm not saying it comes down to short term profits vs long term economic sustainability & prosperity, but if it did would you @PremierScottMoe be willing to change your tune on GHG emissions and oil industry subsidies?
5222 2018-11-01 15:11:19 Could you stop selling oil for a minute to find out?
5223 2018-11-01 15:11:15 Alberta's oil patch:  What ever the staggering damage, if to mention the arsons that take the major toll. Now here is the irony of life you also hear of: not only the environment, massive loss in cost, yet the loss of life if ever of human but the animals burnt alive.
5224 2018-11-01 15:11:08 The Cafe Mac Pizza this Spring Sampler will be: burning crust with moist motor oil and Italian sausage.

5227 2018-11-01 15:11:01 1 liter of water = 2 liters of crude -oil close the deal . Otherwise GTFO.
5228 2018-11-01 15:10:49  You nailed it. The oil and gas industry responsible for this ripoff are thieves and liars willing to let kids get sick rather than regulate fracking.
5229 2018-11-01 15:10:46 Why would the USA deplete it oil, when it can control price world wide. Never give up natural resources until others are depleted.
5230 2018-11-01 15:10:37 oil master jamjam hahahahahahaha huli ka

5235 2018-11-01 15:10:23 This is what happens when you fight oil pipelines. The oil still moves, inefficiently, and in more dangerous ways. The world still needs oil.

5250 2018-11-01 15:09:43 It's primary industry has many competitors, but the sub segment where it operates, is too small for others. Coastal shipping, Shreyas Shipping. Big focus area for govt. They compete with rail and road transport. Rail is not for everyone. Road has to pass on oil costs.
5251 2018-11-01 15:09:43 Agreed that we should sacrifice in the short run for longer run gains. Good news, recent reports are predicting a glut in oil come early 2019.
5252 2018-11-01 15:09:27 I think I read somewhere that the pharma produced is priced extortionately - certainly more expensive than what most of us have purchased on the High Street.  Will it be too expensive for NHS?  I do take CBD oil and very seldom have need for pharma meds now.

5254 2018-11-01 15:09:17 Can people stop posting Facebook statuses like its twitter? Or asking for recommendations for the dumbest things? “I’m looking to get an oil change”
5255 2018-11-01 15:09:15 Management is at times more optimistic than warranted, but slowly building scale needed. Last five years were really not good for the industry and look at numbers. Input cost, approx 30-40% of total, is oil. They are able to pass that on, but with a lag of a quarter or two.

5257 2018-11-01 15:09:00 Went to Walmart for Halloween Candy supply at 6:00pm yesterday. Just back from getting oil change and I’m convinced every Orange box and bag is still in the place they were last night, they’ve just been painted green!
5258 2018-11-01 15:08:53 I spilled my coconut oil. Ughhhh
5259 2018-11-01 15:08:45 I actually need an oil change too lmfao
5260 2018-11-01 15:08:39 Idk why men think women don’t get oil changes. I get mine faithfully lol
5261 2018-11-01 15:08:34 Trump is a coward.
He knows our sanctions are meaningless if Russia, China, India and Europe don't go along with them.
He needs to blockade Iranian oil shipments. A naval blockade.
But, as I said. 
Trump is a coward.
5262 2018-11-01 15:08:33 It's fearmongering when you only stress the positive and discount the huge loss to BC's economy WHEN, not if, there is a tanker spill on our coast. What does she care about our coast? All she wants is the oil.
5263 2018-11-01 15:08:17 If there are viable oil reserves Zanu will plunder them. That's what they do .
5264 2018-11-01 15:08:17 Thought I'd hate myself for this but I guess I timed it perfectly. Schedule an 8 am appointment for an oil change in my car. Turns out my body wanted to wake up an hour before my alarm went off... Blegh....
5265 2018-11-01 15:08:11 Hold up!  Is there really going to be an @Andorramusic beard oil?  Should I bring back the beard

5267 2018-11-01 15:07:50 So many people liking the snub on my proposal of calling Chai as Chai intrigues me that how much we still care for English labels for desi stuff. I have no issues if millions like to have boiled greasy semi liquid with over fried oil dripping condiments. But let's call it CHAI...
5268 2018-11-01 15:07:45 You are so carried away by fake news. Nigeria Debt was forgiven during the time of Obasanjo. Before democrazy and OBJ first term it was 0 debt. PDP borrow the $63billon even with Oil selling highest price and nothing to show for it. #NeverAgain
5269 2018-11-01 15:07:43 Ugh these fish oil burps are so annoying but they were expensive lol next time I’m just going back to the Mega Red lol
5270 2018-11-01 15:07:39 that sounds very efficient. if only we had a non mechanical means of shipping oil across our country... like I don't know.. say a .. pipeline?
5271 2018-11-01 15:07:37 great article, but you neglected to mention how high oil prices can 2004-2008 drove the fracking boom, not just technological advances
5272 2018-11-01 15:07:23 나 손을 너무 쓰레기 같이 그리잖아 한결같이..
5273 2018-11-01 15:07:21 Why don't @realDonaldTrump fix US  the #crude price to $50 and then impose Sanction on Iranian oil. India will buy all it's oil from US then.
5274 2018-11-01 15:07:18 When you go in for a oil change and find out you need everything but one....
5275 2018-11-01 15:07:17 Want a grub 4 a sub

5285 2018-11-01 15:06:19 They are talking about setting up in 2020, I am sure by the time we will be told they have set up shop the oil will have been drained already behind our backs, from 2020 we will be getting left overs

5289 2018-11-01 15:06:00 All I did was get a oil change
5290 2018-11-01 15:05:51 That is funny .. still it imports 40% of its oil requirements... strange behaviour for a country that has as much oil as you say ..
5291 2018-11-01 15:05:44 #crude Oil prices drop as rising supplies meets global economic gloom brent @74.63
5292 2018-11-01 15:05:43 Think they want to reinforce themselves as the central banker of crude oil. Think security is in important reason. US does not need mid east crude. Iraq war 1 is less likely. Their security is worlds security is their narrative. While the learn to fight and arm.
5293 2018-11-01 15:05:39 I don’t like olives but I love olive oil!!!!
5294 2018-11-01 15:05:33 Such biased reporting. We still take Saudi oil and do business and trade with countries that use child labour. Heaven forbid if their leaders are ever  labeled “right of centre” politically. Radical and radically religious is fine though....
5295 2018-11-01 15:05:28 Save the pathetic garbage. Tar oil is garbage oil, when the market for quality oil starts shrinking nobody will waste their time with the garbage. Simple.
Only a brain dead oily would dream otherwise. Is that other clueless coward still crying?
He already proved he is brainless.
5296 2018-11-01 15:05:28 U for tap the oil take fry some plantain.Ibi economical

5299 2018-11-01 15:05:22 Motivo para o petroleo nao andar em um de risk on como hoje :

 India and South Korea agreed with the U.S. on the outline of deals that would allow them to keep importing some Iranian oil
5300 2018-11-01 15:05:12 Been rounding around putting breaks on my car & oil change barely have time to start red dead 2 before work 
5301 2018-11-01 15:05:08 The Dharnas have proved to be a good diversion for the government. Otherwise, they would have seen nationwide protests against hike in oil prices. #BlessinginDisguise #AsiaBibiVerdict

5308 2018-11-01 15:04:46 Haha very true, least compressing a snare involves loads of music, 12 hours in the snow and rain flagged up with oil dirt and all sorts of shit lifting heavy fuck off steel doors wasn’t the most fun like hahah
5309 2018-11-01 15:04:45 Many countries wth oil reserves have terorists grps.wth the discovery of oil&gas reserves i forsee zanu factions unfortunately transforming in2fulltime terrorist grps splitting frm e main terorist grp,zanu ,after 2020.

5316 2018-11-01 15:04:25 It is time we demand that oil co supporting the destruction of our Interior Department and environment stop this activity. We can demand retirement/ investment funds divest them. Let’s start a movement. @TomSteyer @WarrenBuffett @girlsreallyrule @maladamus @soledadobrien @NPR
5317 2018-11-01 15:04:23 .@JerryBrownGov permitted >20K new oil & gas wells. His time in office is ending, but oil's destruction of our air & our health continues. Today, we are delivering 1 MILLION signatures to urge him to take #BrownsLastChance to protect Californians

5330 2018-11-01 15:03:09 Why is anyone buying planes w/o sufficient overhead locker space for one large backpack plus sufficient seat space for one primary school backpack underneath? Or is this a devious way to minimize weight on planes to reduce oil costs? Sigh.
5331 2018-11-01 15:03:06 OMG. Just yesterday I was eating carrots and peanut butter like Cybil, and thinking about the guy's grandpa that cried at everything, including the scent of peppers frying in olive oil because it smelled like his mama's apron.

5333 2018-11-01 15:02:48 The US shale industry has once again defied expectations. New data from the EIA show that US oil production in August 2018 was higher than initial estimates showed.  American producers pumped 11.346 million barrels of oil per day in Aug, an increase of 516K barrels per day.
5334 2018-11-01 15:02:42 The earliest known oil wells were drilled in China in 347 AD or earlier.

The use of petroleum dates back to ancient China more than 2000 years ago.

Or

More than four thousand years ago natural asphalt was employed in the construction of the walls and towers of Babylon - Iraq!

5341 2018-11-01 15:02:10 Well it’s relevant because China is also the main power but what is happening in the case of Iran and crude oil ?
5342 2018-11-01 15:02:08 We hope the oil will benefit the local people in Muzarabani and the nation as a whole. What happened to the diamonds? We have seen elsewhere like Nigeria and Angola, the local people rarely benefit anything due to corruption

5346 2018-11-01 15:01:56 @shahid_siddiqui go see Aurangjeb's grave I the wilderness near Aurangabad, the keeper of the grave begs for money for oil for the lamp.  Such people can't escape the sins of their deeds.
By the way, you do sound like his progeny.
5347 2018-11-01 15:01:51 Oil and gas found in mzarabani your thoughts?
5348 2018-11-01 15:01:48 Much that’s valuable isn’t tabulated in $s n cents.

Carbon Pricing’s about putting value on the huge externalized costs enjoyed most by big oil.

By putting value on them we can all share in that pot of gold. Instead of ALL going to the few. All that so choose will get a few $
5349 2018-11-01 15:01:29 Probably about right if you ignore the oil companies and investors right to make a profit. All future exploration will be handled by sheep farmers who are uniquely skilled in delivering to oil market in the worst possible weather.
5350 2018-11-01 15:01:22 Double oil and gas production.  Build major pipelines to East and west.  Use our own energy. Build clean coal electricity plants. Build refineries near every major center. Export our oil world wide at opec prices. Paid off in 10 years or less

5365 2018-11-01 15:00:22 It is very sad to listen and read the new Brazilian presidents words about Palestine and its people. What did Palestinians do to him? Is it because they dont have oil or nuclear weapons? 
Is it because he is a far-right president?
Very sad.
5366 2018-11-01 15:00:21 Lots of people happy about the India waiver on Iran oil. Based on unnamed sources. Well, turns out unnamed sources these days don't always know what's on the President's mind. 

I'll wait for the formal announcement before cracking the bottle of Old Monk I've held in reserve.
5367 2018-11-01 15:00:17 It got in my eyes while I was sleeping and burned. Vision was blurry for a while. I wouldn’t recommend. Try black castor oil.

5374 2018-11-01 14:59:21 have started taking hempseed oil - good for menopause and absolutely everything frankly. At lunch with a girlfriend I wonder if I’m going to fall off the chair when it kicks in. Her: It’s not psychoactive. And you won’t get the benefit for weeks. Me: Good. I have stuff to do.

The findings are positive
And they will make a statement

Alberta has contributed significantly to confederation.
5389 2018-11-01 14:58:12 I hate both, snd I’ve been fully veggie since 76 and quietly put up with being constantly mocked. Waitrose is also happy to use palm oil resulting in deforestation.
5390 2018-11-01 14:58:10 Can the USA create crude oil .. lol .. it uses 20% of the worlds crude oil but only produces 12% ... it takes millions of years to create oil ..

5405 2018-11-01 14:57:08 Making hyperbolic claims is not “informing” me. You’re obviously not a serious human being as you lack self awareness and a fundamental understanding of what “informing” means. Do you not trust your sources? Hope your snake,  I mean god oil business continues to prosper.

Yay, Chick-fil-A.
5410 2018-11-01 14:56:28 The Bakken Shale is estimated to have more oil than the Saudi peninsula, we barely tapped it. Once they run dry, we not only will have the food dominance in the world, we would control energy as well, that and Islamic cesspits can't innovate worth a damn.

5421 2018-11-01 14:55:08 Hope the oil wont suffer the same fate as the Marange diamonds, plundered by the elite with Zimbabweans gaining nothing from their God given resource
5422 2018-11-01 14:55:01 It's a long game our government plays. We don't have to really tap into most of our oil because the rest of the world still extracts it. Assuming "peak oil" estimates are accurate the middle east region is going to be a bankrupt wasteland in 20-30 years
5423 2018-11-01 14:55:01 Pele sweetie, if you can lay your hands on eucalyptus oil, you should put some drops on an handkerchief and inhale, it helps when you can't steam.

5462 2018-11-01 14:50:46 All monopolies impose costs on society, but those controlling the dominant factor of production are even more so. Data is the oil of the 21st C. If you control it you control how everyone else uses it, and you're incentivized to make them use it in your interests, not theirs.

5466 2018-11-01 14:50:15 You have to acknowledge what Monaco did in 16-17 was absolutely incredible. 13 straight wins at the end of the season with the pressure on to secure the title. 30 wins out of 38 league games. They didn't do it with oil money
5467 2018-11-01 14:50:09 10 years to renegotiate approximately, and those are merely the bilateral / multilateral  deals not full on all encompassing "Trade Deals". Bilateral deals are pretty much like oil to smooth out greater  trade mechanisms. Trade deals such as CETA took 7 years to complete.

5602 2018-11-01 14:37:55 Yes pure coconut oil (preferably cold pressed) is good for the skin. Most oils in their natural forms are. Pure shea butter is also very good for the skin.
5603 2018-11-01 14:37:53 unoti I want to drain the oil for cooking
5604 2018-11-01 14:37:47 Yeah, Focus is at 214k, and I had to work on it a lot of the past couple of years, and there’s always some oil that I can’t find the source of etc. Still runs great though.

5606 2018-11-01 14:37:25 Very true. I caught Forte oil attendant some weeks back trying to short change me. I asked for 5k fuel and as the meter was reading, it changed from N1,999 to N3,000. When I told him I saw what happened, he begged to fill my tank without me paying at all but I refused.

5667 2018-11-01 14:33:05 Hi Erik
Could you slightly elaborate on why you don t see any sanctions ? You refer to elections so i guess the EC would be sensitive about not "pouring more oil on the fire" / not fueling anti establishment parties with more argumentation. Anything else ?

5675 2018-11-01 14:32:45 @dpradhanbjp It seems you have given blank cheque to Oil companies to milk people who have given up subsidy on LPG. Else when crude prices are going down how increase of 103.0 per cylinder is justified since last month. @PMOIndia
5676 2018-11-01 14:32:43 That might not be the worst idea in the long run.

Cut production until we get the pipeline/price we need and deserve.

The need for oil, particularly the heavy stuff, isn't going away anytime soon.

5709 2018-11-01 14:30:11 Colonialism will play a huge role, economically speaking. We may be shunned by some countries, but the US will have our back while we secure them resources. Military intervention on Venezuela is not off the table -- more cheap oil to the US.

5733 2018-11-01 14:28:26 Coconut oil is the easiest to prepare. Just peel it out of the shell,grind or grate it with either blender or manual grater. Wash it and take the shafts out, allow it to settle down, scope the up,put it in freezer, then use low heat to cook it out.Your oil is ready in 30mins.

At least 18 major extractives companies have made statements in favor of some form of contract disclosure & 44 governments have disclosed at least one contract. It is no longer okay to keep details of resource deals secret.

5776 2018-11-01 14:25:16 Aberdeen really went bust when the oil price collapsed. My mum used to work there. As the oil workers, who were almost 100% men, left due to the collapse, so did their wives, who were often teachers, civil servants and nurses. It exasperated the problem.

5840 2018-11-01 14:18:42 Yes you can but it takes concentration and focus. If you want to, you have to stick with it and if you can’t, just check out for creams without hydroquinone and mercury. There are lots of good creams out there. Sometimes I use coconut oil on my hands, feet and face.
5841 2018-11-01 14:18:39 Solar also has a cost...I am not the expert but the cost of solar has been decreasing in the last few years so maybe only now it is worth using it. Most people do not realize but with Brent at 75 most forms of green energy are far more expensive than oil.
5842 2018-11-01 14:18:28 Good point. When negotiators are sufficiently skilled and when they know that the outcome of their work will be public and subject to legal and commercial scrutiny, they have powerful incentives to use their knowledge to draft more carefully.

5865 2018-11-01 14:16:07 That’s the thing ... it’s either one or the other-med mj or pain meds. That’s why I tried CBD oil first but found no relief what-so-ever. Also it made me nervous. I know it helps lots of people.

5869 2018-11-01 14:15:42 Not being averse to other criminal earnings and holding a position of a vice-president in «Rosneft», I used to get kickbacks. Thus, I got 10 dollars per each ton of oil bought from external suppliers. Entrepreneurs had to pay me money just to get my sign in the contract.

5890 2018-11-01 14:13:12 Careful abt the way you read this. ‘Replace’ makes it seem like graph represents a zero sum over time, but the *amount* of energy is also going up.  It would be possible for this graph to show a relative increase in solar as a % while hiding an absolute increase in gas or oil

5896 2018-11-01 14:12:40 It is good that the American government does not sanction India, China or South Korea for purchasing oil for Iran. We need to negotiate with Iran, instead of continuing the destruction of middle eastern countries, including Afghanistan, Iraq, Palestine, Syria, etc.

5911 2018-11-01 14:11:40 The specialty of the snake oil salesman is to foment the fear of diseases to deceive people into buying their cure-all potions, a counterfeit product. In these days of manufactured fear, snake oil salesmen abound.

5916 2018-11-01 14:11:11 It effing sucks on the road. I have to find out if chain places have allergen menus, then find out what kind of oil they cook with (usually soybean because it’s cheapest), call local places, bring extra food in a cooler, etc.
5917 2018-11-01 14:11:10 Lmao I actually know a girl who bought a car and had no idea she had to put more in her car than gas. Went almost 10k miles without a drop of oil lmfao

5920 2018-11-01 14:11:01 They are the largest supporter of global terrorism. Why wasn’t this already done in previous administrations? Needed the oil is my guess. Trump developed OUR oil and then imposed sanctions. Smart guy... I guess that’s why incomes are way up and unemployment is at record lows too.

5928 2018-11-01 14:10:13 This is why he won, because the ruling class tells us to shut up as they import millions of debt slaves and new voters. The ruling class uses these same tactics to justify their oil wars and it's our sons, brothers, and fathers who are sent to die.

6003 2018-11-01 14:02:33 Everything is much worse than the Willie Horton era, TBH, Kevin.  The bar is about to strike oil, it's so low.
6004 2018-11-01 14:02:24 It is always pricey due to low performance at the non-oil export arena. There is over dependence on oil for foreign exchange. Impact of the currency swap is yet to be felt. A gradual market led devaluation would have assuage the pressure the festive season beats on the naira!

6012 2018-11-01 14:01:57 Engine Oil | You need only the best oil for your tractors and hard working equipment. These kinds of engines must be able to perform at peak efficiency in all kinds of conditions. You cannot afford to have a lubrication problem. Start 24/7 Fuels provides only the best engine oils
6013 2018-11-01 14:01:54 So we have the bear flag broken on the weekly $TLT chart and the US dollar gapping down-now if oil prices firm ($USO sup to hold 13.50)-I'd say all 3 are relaying a strong message of caution

6129 2018-11-01 13:49:54 In my little paradise, my studio in Long Island City, New York, giving shape to my dreams and obsessions. Untitled ( until now) oil on canvas.
6130 2018-11-01 13:49:47 There is no UK dependency on Russia. Not many people know that the UK both buys and sells gas. Difference in middle east is oil and gas don't need fracking as they come from conventional wells. Fracking uses loads more energy than conventional.
6131 2018-11-01 13:49:38 I have glitter all over my chest AGAIN just from styling my hair this morning. Mind you, I doused my head in olive oil yesterday and washed it already. This is actual terrorism
6132 2018-11-01 13:49:35 Only two things I’m def trying to accomplish this weekend. My son needs to be groomed and I need a damn oil change
6133 2018-11-01 13:49:34 @sambitswaraj @dpradhanbjp @PetroleumMin @PMOIndia @PrakashJavdekar Dear leaders, this company @oilpr has not yet declared the results of #GradeC exam held over a year ago. This is gross lethargy and unaccountability on the part of OIL. Pls direct @oilpr to declare results ASAP.
6134 2018-11-01 13:49:17 No oil there. And "Marshall plans" for Iraq and Afghanistan were... I was going to write "total fuck ups" but were there any at all?

6138 2018-11-01 13:49:01 So you'll accelerate climate change and I'll spend my final years in a dystopian hell contemplating the tragedy of future generations so that your friends can enjoy unfettered oil profits.  Sounds like a Con Party platform.
6139 2018-11-01 13:48:42 Before electricity, each day at dusk, a person with a torch would go through the village lighting up oil lamps set up on poles. Gradually, the entire village would be lit up. That is what a saint is like - lighting up the world with good deeds. #AllSaintsDay #FeastofAllSaints

6153 2018-11-01 13:47:19 generally Price movements will be based solely on the price of oil with this one
6154 2018-11-01 13:46:54 Could be.

But is CO2 the only criterion for an energy supply? Why? 

PS - unless I'm mistaken, 'biomass' is wood and dung. High carbon. Like oil.
6155 2018-11-01 13:46:52 Always looked like a bargain to those who understand the oil and gas space. All time highs are still a bargain!!

6167 2018-11-01 13:45:48 Its overall purpose was to estimate the overall UK borrowing requirement for Scotland - it was created at this time because Scottish Office ministers thought due to then-low oil prices, the report would show Scotland gained far more from the UK Treasury than it received.[4]

6189 2018-11-01 13:42:55 Very gross. The British empire destroyed my country and my ability to enjoy the blessings of our resources because they used the Church of England as their weapon to cover up the looting that’s still going on today. The Niger Delta has been sinking from oil floods
6190 2018-11-01 13:42:52 and that's from the AER, an organization that is captured by oil and gas industry...
6191 2018-11-01 13:42:49 You gotta check oil level, the quality of the old oil in case your intake manifold/head gasket is bad depending on how long ago the last oil change was.

6195 2018-11-01 13:42:28 They’re good cars, just depends on how they were maintained. I’ve owned 3 dodge engined cars. When you change your oil try to use a full-synthetic oil, or at very least a synthetic blend. Don’t use a conventional/cheap oil with these. If you can get warranty, try to cop that.
6196 2018-11-01 13:42:20 No oil left though. £1.35 ltr of fuel. Get tae fuck

6203 2018-11-01 13:41:49 Gas is about twice as much energy per CO2 than coal, only about 30% more than oil, and about 8x more than biomass. Biomass is actually low carbon, and we could do it here.

Hydro, wind and solar are about 100x better (these are lifetime values)

6284 2018-11-01 13:31:36 But given that their Oil Fields lease is expiring in 2020. Do you think market is going to de rate the Stock until it gets the confirmation of Oil Fields been allocated to it again.

Do you know anything about their expansion or operation improvement plans?
6285 2018-11-01 13:31:35 This is an excellent move.  We have more oil than anyone else on the planet and we can use this action to move our oil to European nations that need it.  It's time to put a fence around Iran and it's financial sources.

6288 2018-11-01 13:31:14 Apparently there are mice in my apt (I haven’t seen one, knock on wood) so I ordered peppermint oil which they hate, but until it arrives I just put a cup of peppermint tea on my floor hoping that does something????

6294 2018-11-01 13:30:35 Part of problem: "resource curse" of oil driven wealth. Citizens in such economies less inclined to think of it is as theirs if it does not directly come from their pay-check, hence "oil" producing countries more prone to mass theft. Is this correct Loay? If so, how to fix?

6299 2018-11-01 13:30:10 Rupee strengthened against the US Dollar today as a weak dollar index and fall in crude oil prices lifted sentiment. Some foreign banks cut their long dollar bets. Exporters' dollar sales also aided the domestic currency. The Rupee ended at 73.45 vs. previous close of 73.95.

6305 2018-11-01 13:29:58 Government bond prices ended higher today as a fall in crude oil prices eased concerns of domestic inflation heading high. Also, RBI had set a higher-than-expected cut-off price at today’s INR 120 bn OMO bond purchase.

6336 2018-11-01 13:26:33 I think you are right about the main reason. But I also wouldn't forget that in the past 10 years, many European exporters have Chinese shareholders. Chinese oil buys could help net the sales of EU companies to Iran, especially those with Chinese shareholding.

Crude oil and commodities cannot have their prices grossly inflated by HFT for too long, as a black market would be created trading those in real human prices. 

That is not the case with stocks and currencies. Those are digital, not real assets.

6398 2018-11-01 13:20:57 BTW, interesting Q as to whether China wants to be integrated in SPV. They have a major commercial advantage in captive Iranian oil proceeds. Main reason I can imagine to open up is that, like Moscow, they want SPV to be a move toward breaking European financial dependency on NY.

6433 2018-11-01 13:16:47 I think Jefferson is a decent cheap option. Think he only averages about 4.5 tg per game and Franks likely throws at least one, maybe two of those uncatchable, so you just gotta hope he strikes oil on a ball like that easy TD the first drive last week that FF whiffed on.
6434 2018-11-01 13:16:42 Are you producing carbon black oil ?
6435 2018-11-01 13:16:39 Im gonna get some oil and try it this weekend to see if it knocks me out. I’ll let you know 
6436 2018-11-01 13:16:17 Well u r right in a slight decrease in sales.  My take if sales continues at same pace than also it will move much higher again it has good proven oil reserves so bet for some what say 1 yr at least.  Good buy below 200 were I entered with good qty.  For a duration of 1 yr

6452 2018-11-01 13:14:33 Had this been, a lets say, Ukranian journo in a Russian embassy, you can bet every dollar you have that this would be a pre-cursor to war, but when the aggressor in question literally fuels your army and bank accounts via arms sales and oil imports - this is the result.

6454 2018-11-01 13:14:15 That is not right. 
Saudi Arabia has more than you think. 
- Tow holy mosque  .
- The largest oil exporting country.
-member of the group of 20 (G20). 
- 1.5 billion Muslims believe Saudi Arabia should remain safe. 
No other Islamic country has such features.
6455 2018-11-01 13:14:11 The sales department at Arimis oil must believe there's a ton of dairy cattle in this land. 
6456 2018-11-01 13:14:10 Yep.

That's why I said 'low' not 'no'.

But if CO2 worries you you can get about twice the amount of energy for the same amount compared with coal or oil.

6469 2018-11-01 13:12:41 Fine, but why? It's not a very cost-effective way to store oil especially if land storage has space available. Not saying you're wrong, just struggling to understand why unless it's short-term pending deliveries.
6470 2018-11-01 13:12:38 @Acura - my MDX has oil consumption problem. I need corporate help as this requires warranty support and now repair. Suggestions?

6512 2018-11-01 13:08:02 Because he wants too help others that were in his position which I think is why most people sell it. I’d rather buy it off people like that, that actually have knowledge of it than those random shops you see claiming too sell cbd oil when it’s basically nothing but shite

6526 2018-11-01 13:06:33 Mr alhajji, I think it is unfair to imply that Iran is exporting its oil through Irag. Iraq has a huge reserve potential that was in the process of development for a long period of time. In fact Iraq was planning to bypass Saudi production of 10 mmbpd long before the gulf war.

6532 2018-11-01 13:06:24 Ultimately wouldn’t it actually give pro 112 what they actually want by pushing the government to make decisions on oil and gas development?  It puts the government in a spot to actually do their job. Just saying

6537 2018-11-01 13:05:55 At the rate that technology is increasing we will make changes and adapt before then, however, it is likely that fossil fuels will still have the best power to weight ratio and so those with oil when the rest of the world runs out may have the upper hand militarily speaking.

6544 2018-11-01 13:05:23 He has never been in West Texas or looked at oil industry stats has he? We don’t need any of their oil.
6545 2018-11-01 13:05:23 Yeah should pay $50,000 per soldier to fight in oil wars to keep the price of gas down and keep the middle East a war town hell hole.

6551 2018-11-01 13:04:50 One time, I was having an anaphylactic reaction and the person I was with put lavender oil in my mouth without my consent, which made the reaction worse and I literally almost died. Don't be stupid with essential oils friends.

6557 2018-11-01 13:04:13 Texans benefit from proximity to oil resources and a legacy of federal investment into the aerospace industry.  Californians benefit from Dept of Def spending.  It’s not policies, it’s momentum.
6558 2018-11-01 13:04:10 Yeah, I mean it has nothing to with the rural land owners who can no longer sell their mineral rights if 112 passes. Wouldn’t it work the other way also? Couldn’t anyone living close to oil and gas activity also sue the state for bringing down property value?
6559 2018-11-01 13:04:02 Keep in mind Jim that US forces have Iraq and Isis under control. The southern border is a chaotic mess.

6626 2018-11-01 12:56:15 Nigeria has been the world's 5th largest oil exporter since the mid 1950's. But you never see many rich Nigerians. Shell owns and runs that country like its own little colony on behalf of its SH's, one of the largest of whom is the uber-avaricious Queen Beatrice. Nasty outfit.

6629 2018-11-01 12:55:49 Confounding this: tylenol is metabolized to a cannabinoid, fish oil’s antidepressant effects require cannabinoids and NSAIDs likely cause pooling of precursor (arachidonic acid) for the cannabinoid system, so new studies will have to control for these.

6631 2018-11-01 12:55:36 Read something about Iceland mince pies that are supposed to be first supermarket chain ones to be palm oil free. So much is the significance of this that Selfridges are stocking them. Apparently they taste ok too.
6632 2018-11-01 12:55:31 Yep. Low carbon.

CH4 + 3O2 --> CO2 + 2H2O +  heat.  

Just one carbon atom involved. 

The country that has reduced its carbon emissions the most is USA. By switching from coal and oil to fracked gas.

6641 2018-11-01 12:54:47 I think that public perception was manufactured frankly.

There was more profit in existing fossil fuel markets, so oil companies lobbied against expanding nuclear power.

Even modern reactors have risk like anything, but they are manageable.

6644 2018-11-01 12:54:27 You can also roast it - thick slices with some olive oil on them, into the oven for an hour or two.

6648 2018-11-01 12:54:09 Refining capacity is also an issue, we sell our oil at a huge discount to the USA to be refined in the southern states. It is then shipped back to us. 
We need to build refineries in Canada for Canadian oil and then create the distribution channels to ship across the country.

More of us success? YUAN at its lowest against USD i.e more trade deficit to come. If you're answering give evidence.

6843 2018-11-01 12:34:02 Im not a “Look at Venezuela” person when discussing socialism but in this case it’s too obvious to avoid. The very first thing Hugo Chavez did after being elected in 1999 was to nationalize privately owned oil companies. It was a very fast downhill slide from there.

6877 2018-11-01 12:28:36 OIL: Oil prices fell to extend losses from the previous session, pressured by signs of rising supply and by growing concerns that demand may weaken on the prospect of a global economic slowdown.

6881 2018-11-01 12:28:29 Good point... But I have heard that in Germany, trains are almost worse than planes, running on diesel or electricity from oil sources. I keep believing they are slightly better though -- and otherwise take the bus. Stay on the ground :)
6882 2018-11-01 12:28:18 Y’all play too much
6883 2018-11-01 12:28:14 Oil prices will likely stay near current levels of $75 per barrel next year in the absence of any supply disruptions as most producers reckon that higher prices would destroy demand and create a new glut
6884 2018-11-01 12:28:07 Sure, I’ll make it easy:

Tax bad things to discourage use of harmful product (tobacco, alcohol, coal, oil), then use that revenue to cover the costs from the harm of those products (health, environment). 

Need anything else?

6887 2018-11-01 12:27:41 OPEC has boosted oil production in October to the highest since 2016, a Reuters survey found, as higher output led by the United Arab Emirates and Libya more than offset a cut in Iranian shipments due to U.S. sanctions.
6888 2018-11-01 12:27:36 Beware of the rip off merchants offering full spectrum oil. You can make it with an ounce of grass and pure alcohol.

6897 2018-11-01 12:25:59 China's crude oil imports from Iran in September fell sharply from the same month last year, a sign that China has curbed its purchases from the Islamic republic. Shipments from Iran stood at 2.13M tonnes in Sep, or 518,300 bpd, down 34% from 3.22M tonnes last Sep.

- I could probably be a little less gentle with the dough.  It uses cake flour so it won't toughen up too quickly
- Need to oil the pastry wheel for cutting.
- So THAT'S why it calls for a buttered sheet pan

6917 2018-11-01 12:22:44 Indeed, the elite nations would still have a higher share, as their emissions are much higher and their contribution for deforestation is not small. In fact a lot of deforestation taking place in Africa is to supply timber or palm oil etc to elite nations.
6918 2018-11-01 12:22:44 Rubbing Alcohol worked but my face is a bit raw from trying with coconut oil before I finally found that trick 
6919 2018-11-01 12:22:20 Russia is pumping out oil again at Soviet era highs, US is pumping out a record 11 billion barrels a day. OPEC countries have also increased output. This is good news in time for Iranian sanctions on oil next week. Seems the have figured a way to make up the supply.

7086 2018-11-01 11:55:11 That refinery was one of the dumbest projects ever executed by the military regime. The cost of pumping crude oil to Kaduna from Niger-delta is ridiculous.
7087 2018-11-01 11:55:07 Eat a healthy breakfast, but don't eat too much. Eat whole grains, such as whole-grain bread. Eat healthy fats, such as olive oil and nuts.

Olive oil.
7090 2018-11-01 11:54:14 Cannabis oil cures brain tumours and cancer. This should of been done decades ago and there's nothing wrong with smoking it. It's far safer than alcohol that kills thousands of people every year in the U.K. and that's legal. Dumb laws
7091 2018-11-01 11:54:07 Going to Ocoee today for work. Also have a doctor's appointment & oil change.
7092 2018-11-01 11:54:05 I use @Krakenbeardco oil and balm. It's all made with natural ingredients, so it's super fresh, soaks in well, and smells great! They also ship worldwide :)

7094 2018-11-01 11:53:55 So Iranian oil sanctions kick in November 4th meaning a huge hike in oil prices.....

7099 2018-11-01 11:52:39 The biggest sin. Olive trees originated in the Levant, my grandfather used to own acres of them and he’d make olive oil by hand. This just makes me mad.
7100 2018-11-01 11:52:38 TY, Politico, for explaining ND's quirks. I've been paying attn to news, but no one mentioned the lack of registration and have been wondering about impact of Bakken oil fields, Politico is first to mention that also.

Vegans are most unlikely to want to consume palm oil which is implicated in destroying natural habitats.

Despite LOW oil price Buhari is completing all the abandoned projects of PDP, paying pension owe for 30 years, bailing out states, Npower? School feeding? Trademoni? Yet the reserve is 5 year high, excess crude account is rising. Shame

7179 2018-11-01 11:42:19 Yep, only now instead of Leopold having the upper hand, it’s China. While the world went to war over oil, it was buying up mines. DRC has world’s largest reserve of coltan, and significant cobalt & copper. In the age of tech, he who controls mines controls the world.

7220 2018-11-01 11:37:22 There is a history from the days when the Americans built up the Norwegian oil industry. Every time the Norwegians tried to make lamb or fish dinner, the Americans threw it all over board. T-bone was the only dinner.

7222 2018-11-01 11:36:48 Again, can you tell me the value of oil revenue.
And yes, because you will condemn the citizens to decades of struggle merely to return to the current economic state we are in now.
7223 2018-11-01 11:36:43 Nice summary, thanks. If the Tapi Aike shallow oil target is independent of the gas targets and its seismic is already shot, will it be drilled sooner rather than later? Q1 2019? Any chance?  #ECHO
7224 2018-11-01 11:36:07 +I mentioning it again energy market's or consumerism  are not India centric, So this consipiracy theorey they targeting India is total nonsense. As being an 14 years  experienced oil & commodity Industry person I can assure u that your opinions are just your imagination.+

7233 2018-11-01 11:34:09 Japanese Gov & industry officials were hopeful of winning an exemption from US unilateral sanctions taking effect from Nov 5.
India also hopes to secure a waiver, it has significantly cut Iranian oil imports prior to unilateral sanctions.
US says it does not want to harm allies.

7238 2018-11-01 11:33:51 Oh yeah, let’s tax the sh*t out of diesel and home heating oil when we all know emissions are rising because of a deliberate plan to expand the national dairy herd and export milk powder for Chinese babies
7239 2018-11-01 11:33:42 How much was tax take from oil last year?
7240 2018-11-01 11:33:30 You guys are so funny. Don't worry when that oil dries up or when the rest of the world abandons it, let's know if you will still be singing about more earnings and less earning. Don't create other avenues of earning revenue, stay and be waiting on oil.

7246 2018-11-01 11:32:44 I'm proud of all of those. Don't forget oil and natural gas, helping Veterans, picking Pence, rooting out government corruption - at least the veneer and finally, telling the American people the TRUTH for a change!

7248 2018-11-01 11:32:26 That's why I told you to understand PC video.  Imports "appear" to be more than exports as they charge too much for oil & corrupt Commie states kill factories &  export Agri at throwaway prices. This will PERSIST even if 50% INDIANS go abroad & REMIT, till u sell finished goods.
7249 2018-11-01 11:32:13 America can not relay on oil alone. We must invest in clean energy as well. Solar, Wind, Cobalt, Renewable battery packs, Exc... This is a must for America going forward. Invest in future opportunity today! #USA

7888 2018-11-01 09:44:00 @MoPNG_eSeva @PMOIndia you talk of facilities to customers but don't give a shit to employees in oil and gas sector. DPE and MOPN&G have failed tens of thousands of employees who work in shift against biological clocks to ensure critical services to nation.

8045 2018-11-01 09:14:33 although note that data allocates oil revenues per capita (iirc)

in a way though my point is that “times bigger” is not really a good way to think of it

a £10 deficit is 10x bigger than a £1 deficit, but £12bn is “only” 20% bigger than a £10bn deficit

8144 2018-11-01 08:54:32 I am never sleeping again. It’s 1:37AM and I’m lively as a lemur. Am debating drinking, since 2 Xanax, Buspar, and 2 kinds of antihistamine have not touched me. Also suspecting I have a tumor on the olfactory center of my brain because I keep smelling dirty 30-weight motor oil.
8145 2018-11-01 08:54:27 It's important that they're dry. I think you could use oil (if cooking outside, it will smoke a LOT).
I used for searing in a skillet or over coals, so it could flare up and cook with fire.
For gas grill I never used oil.
8146 2018-11-01 08:54:27 #KhashoggiMurder Saudi Arabia is treathening the world because it's got oil,oil only. So therefore it's ok to murder, rape kill school kids and all the crimes they are doing.

8147 2018-11-01 08:54:26 T.Boone is just very long and trying to talk up his book. The price action of oil over the last few weeks has been almost disastrous. At this pace in less than one month WTI will be going under 60.
8148 2018-11-01 08:53:59 Oil prices dropped in early Thursday trading, extending its losses in the previous trading sessions, following signs of rising supply and growing concerns that demand will suffer on the prospect of a global economic slowdown.

8153 2018-11-01 08:53:20 No. It's because of the oil sands.

8170 2018-11-01 08:48:51 There’s really not much to need to defend. It’s a smart decision and one in line with the direction that energy policy needs to go. Most energy companies are also divesting from coal, oil, and gas.

8180 2018-11-01 08:46:37 Brent oil is breaking down through key supports = early warning signal for bulls in stocks.
8181 2018-11-01 08:46:37 I think it's probably a fairly common practice; cheaper servicing but then make new work. Worth checking connections (as best you can safely). On mine they usually loosen the oil supply line.
8182 2018-11-01 08:46:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, however however many there may be.

8184 2018-11-01 08:45:49 Well.. They can stay solvent for many months and maybe even years... This is why there is now a major perception of oversupply in the market. Oil now falls every day. WTI is very near the lows of August.

8187 2018-11-01 08:45:20 No. You aren't. The price of oil in the US is still determined by the price of oil worldwide. The US may not import as much as it did, but it will still pay whatever the global price is. A geopolitical crisis in the Middle East still means much higher gasoline prices in the US.
8188 2018-11-01 08:45:14 I will never trust any of the big semi truck company mechanics to do oil changes. Took my semi truck for a pm and when I checked the oil shit was black af, so I know for a fact that they didn’t change the oil lol. When I get my own only a legit .
8189 2018-11-01 08:44:31 1) Do you think scots would be better off with 100% of oil revenues or the 8% we get now?
2) Do you think scots are wrong to want to run their own country?
I`ll be amazed  if your politics are strong enough to answer those questions

8395 2018-11-01 08:07:36 Dude, pumping oil, breathing the fumes, transporting the oil with ships trains, trucks,  refining, transporting the refined stuff again + the constant oil spills..... those are all good for children, right ??????  and btw Tesla batteries soon wont need cobalt.
8396 2018-11-01 08:07:36 Are Petrol stations ripping us off? The price of oil has come down $12 a barrel over the past month why are petrol still so high? Depending on currency & as an example for every $3 per barrel the petrol price should come down 1p per litre! It should be around £1.27 per litre now
8397 2018-11-01 08:07:32 HIGHEST PRICES ON GASOLINE- TRUMP PAYBACK TO OIL COMPANIES -ALLOWS RAISING GAS PRICES TO PAY FOR $500 MILLION OIL COS GAVE TO TRUMP FOR HIS PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION/ THUS MAKING ALL AMERICANS PAYING FOR THE $500 MILLION SPENDING-SHAMEFUL PRESIDENT

8400 2018-11-01 08:07:23 Well I didn't mean why did he post this, trying to figure out why the depletion is coming and coming so fast.
Oil is going up now
8401 2018-11-01 08:07:19 Nak cari engine oil pun aku pening. Apa yg elok eh?
8402 2018-11-01 08:07:02 Neither the U.S. nor the world needs Saudi Arabia or their oil.
US, Russia, and others can make it up.
The House of Saud has been holding the world hostage for 50 years.
Time to stop. They are no better than Iran. And worse in many ways.
8403 2018-11-01 08:07:01 As the earth prepares its horrors, our kings and betters built walls out of our corpses; bunkers from overtime and spires with bloody bullets
The Oil Age was a drunken thing
But just a fling
8404 2018-11-01 08:06:55 To make the change happen, 1st we must learn to straighten our own ranks. those who lick the ball of royals of other nations, are not loyals of our nations. so whose mouth drool at the sound of oil money, are not fit to lead this country.
8405 2018-11-01 08:06:41 It's the hypocrisy of Trudeau and the liberals that kills me. We condemn the death of the wapo journalist at the hands of the Saudis but keep buying their oil and hamstringing our own resource sector. I'd still rather have our system than the trash fire that is the US

8408 2018-11-01 08:05:58 Shipping (especially outside emission control areas) operates on cheapest fuels. Without regulation, synth fuels will be sold to other, better paying uses first. Technically vessels can operate on almost anything that burns. Oil use on land is still increasing.

8410 2018-11-01 08:05:36 The end of Saudi oil age is rapidly approaching.
~2/3 of global oil exports (~40 mil bbl/day) is burned in petrol engines.
2030/2040: Sale of petrol cars will stop in China,Denmark,France,Germany, Holland,India,Norway,UK...
Green energy is more powerful than US protection of GCC.

8540 2018-11-01 07:39:11 Why? The cannabis oil being prescribed to those kids is non-psychoactive as it has little to no THC. They'd need to ingest a lot of oil to get high, but would likely throw up first. I smoke the plant to treat IBD, and it works brilliantly. About time it's legalised.

8562 2018-11-01 07:34:52 Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Hair growth slows as you age. Do not comb wet hair rigorously. Is it NISIM or NHB? A good hair loss shampoo. or somewhat related. How must I pin down the precise URL. My hair misses it. Really want it.
8563 2018-11-01 07:34:51 Zander was already a few hours into burning the midnight oil. Damn did it feel great to be something to fear again. He had plenty to hunt after his month off. 

This was going to be one Hell of a year.

8565 2018-11-01 07:34:48 Cbd oil is beneficial in so many ways. Reduces anxiety, chronic pain, treats epilepsy, improves cardiovascular health, reduces chance of diabetes. The drawbacks and negatives are you have to pay and can't get it prescribed. Which will now change slowly but surely
8566 2018-11-01 07:34:46 Well, least their moving future forward! If you think about it, when the world moves to electric, where will that leave all these terrorist country's, who only have oil to sale for their economies? Broke! & they know it, so their grabbing every dime they can by gouging gas prices
8567 2018-11-01 07:34:40 Oh how I envy people who can let their hair air dry and be done with it. Washing my curly frizzy hair is an event that needs to be scheduled. Wash, allow to dry until damp, add hair oil, blow dry, wait a few minutes to allow hair to cool, straighten and set 
8568 2018-11-01 07:34:27 Shem askies. Nna I just wash my hair 1/2 a week and put some oil and that just it.

8570 2018-11-01 07:34:06 Glad cannabis oil has been legalised. Can help so many people with epilepsy and Parkinson's. Just hope people dont take the mick and take up valuable doctors appointments
8571 2018-11-01 07:33:49 Not necessarily.
The money said to have bring paid for subsidy should be used to fix our Refinery and then regulate market prices. The best is to move away from oil and put our efforts towards agriculture which is a gold mine.
Agriculture sustained us before oil deceived us

8582 2018-11-01 07:32:04 The doctor saying that doctors will become drug dealers is talking rubbish as this oil has no THC in it so I can’t see youngsters rushing to there doctors to get there drugs
8583 2018-11-01 07:31:57 What did you use to clean? I really like an anti dandruff shampoo for deep cleaning heavy pigments (followed with a normal brush cleaner to sanitise). Oil cleanser would work too. Be careful when soaking your brushes with water though as can loosen the glue :)

8585 2018-11-01 07:31:47 @GMB the reason so many people have anxiety or depression on chronic pain killers is because it’s a common side effect of the pain killers....how can a doctors accept any drug suggested with a arms length of side effects but is worried about cannabis oil?

8602 2018-11-01 07:29:40 I love putting pesto as a topping on pizza, it's so good! But, you need to check the oil it's made with. If it's made with olive oil, it'll burn, you need to find one made with a high-smoke oil like canola oil.

8753 2018-11-01 07:02:57 It's weird that NYT has this story when the economic times just reported India is going to get waiver in buying oil from Iran if it imports 35% less than last year. I think that's enough to be offset by Saudi increase in production and will keep oil prices in check.

8784 2018-11-01 06:56:01 It’s what it all comes down to at the end of the day.  They’ll destroy the world (literally and metaphorically) to pump out their oil and gas for as long as they can.

8786 2018-11-01 06:55:47 The more terrifying graph is the one that shows our use of coal did not significantly decline with the addition of oil - rather our total energy usage simply increased dramatically

8789 2018-11-01 06:55:28 Sure. But better for it to be expensive because of a big carbon tax with the money used to reduce other taxes or increase benefits or spent in other ways than the money going to oil companies.

8801 2018-11-01 06:53:20 It was never a good deal for America that under Jimmy Carter lost its most reliable ally, but the worst nightmare was Soviet reaching the Persian gulf and Iranian oil.

8959 2018-11-01 06:23:10 The steam isn't good for your gun. Make sure you wrap a towel around it and oil it regularly. Otherwise it will get sticky and malfunction.
8960 2018-11-01 06:22:54 SA is a modern dictatorship run by men as women have not the slightest power at all. It has nothing to do with human rights or democracy. People are beheaded publicly. Their wealth is mainly based on oil and gas. Have they ever won a Nobel Prize? What about Kashoggi?
8961 2018-11-01 06:22:28 At 2:22 AM, I wanna do a hot oil treatment. Wow
8962 2018-11-01 06:22:23 Like pouring vats of boiling oil over the castle's battlements onto those rude people with scaling ladders?
8963 2018-11-01 06:22:06 What is this oil you keep telling us about? Why haven't you been using your oil? You can drink it, bathe or swim in it, it is your oil! Many of us don't even know that such oil exists as we have never seen, used or benefited from the same.

8969 2018-11-01 06:21:20 Eight core sectors – which comprises 40.7 % in IIP, slowed down to 4.3% in Sept ‘18, as against 4.7% last year. Production of Steel, coal, crude oil and natural gas declined, while fertilizers, cement and electricity output grew.
8970 2018-11-01 06:21:08 Oil prices already on down turn. 10 days back it was around 86 $ now it's around 75$.
8971 2018-11-01 06:21:08 Do not comb wet hair rigorously. Eat well. Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Is it NISIM or NHB? A hair loss shampoo. or comparable. How must I pin down the appropriate URL. An affordable gift. Worth the time.

8975 2018-11-01 06:20:30 In theory, it’s great. However, the saying “less is more” seems to prevail in the debate. The DI AR-15 system just works. Modifying a rifle that was designed for DI to run gas piston, is like converting a diesel truck to run on vegetable oil. It will work, but inefficiently.

9094 2018-11-01 05:58:11 Also he’s talking about CBD oil... which is literally like.... nothing. And legal everywhere in the USA. Bc it’s nothing. And his mother was taking synthetics - which puts money back in the pharm companies as opposed to us being able to grow our own medicine.

9218 2018-11-01 05:35:58 Will the oil giants ever learn that there are vast amounts of money to be made from solar and wind farms and energy storage facilities?

Instead of drilling holes in the ground for limited supplies of dangerous chemicals, they could own clean, safe, inexhaustible energy sources.

9284 2018-11-01 05:30:09 Now that the Dodd-Frank transparency rules have been killed, he's most likely working diligently, selling off all the oil and other natural resources, America has to offer, since everything is literally at Trump's disposal. America is now his own private slush fund.

9286 2018-11-01 05:30:02 Any university (and there are dozens) offering online courses in autism education or therapy are simply selling snake oil. These courses are incredibly lucrative for the university but damaging to the autistic person. “Learning” about autism w/out engaging autistic people is BS.
9287 2018-11-01 05:29:54 The smell of tea tree oil reminds me of Mexico...

9297 2018-11-01 05:27:09 Unless it is accompanied with improved public transport, people will suffer. Good from one side though. Will reduce oil consumption and overall import will decline though very slightly. @Miss_Kadyan ?
9298 2018-11-01 05:26:36 The idea that any legislation has ever been passed with the intent to reward people who violate the law, or sanction any inconsequential result of such legislation, resulting in rewarding unlawful entry is absurd.
9299 2018-11-01 05:26:32 All retired and active duty members get a free oil change at my job and I’m literally so scared  our locations are going to be soooo jam packed man.
9300 2018-11-01 05:26:25 But assuming you don’t have mike up wipes or micellar water, use sorbelene cream or like coconut oil or something
9301 2018-11-01 05:26:19 Once dressed in one of FP's old shirts that she had borrowed before and her small shorts, she picked up her rose gold cannabis oil vape pens with an engraved snake on the side. She turned to walk over to the bed and crawls in, staying on the side of the bed near the bathroom.
9302 2018-11-01 05:26:05 I bet Lady Snake smells like blend of B.O., cabbage and patchouli oil. #ghostadventureslive

9304 2018-11-01 05:25:33 Coconut oil or moisturizing facial cream
9305 2018-11-01 05:25:19 The distinction is clear by the way. And it happens more often than not. Should big oil for instance be allowed to formulate government environment policy? Big capital should not write bills for the legislative arm of government.
9306 2018-11-01 05:25:17 tea tree oil smells so bad
9307 2018-11-01 05:25:15 Exciting vacation plans so far:

9308 2018-11-01 05:25:06 Have you found what it is? Sometimes I believe I'm allergic to everything pantu takwaba. Latest hospital trip was thanks to coconut oil. I only realised after applying for the third time and it was too late.
9309 2018-11-01 05:24:58 If you don’t have make up removing wipes, try a bit of olive oil!
9310 2018-11-01 05:24:49 At this point I'm going to assume you're probably a paid oil company shill using ridiculous numbers like "100 manhattan sized" as a unit of area. The Gobi desert is 22,727 the size of manhattan. death valley is 239 times the size of manhattan
9311 2018-11-01 05:24:43 Lol... You realize that we send billions of dollars in aid to countries like  North Korea, Venezela, Nigeria, right??... Hell we even send money to Saudi Arabia... And they are oil rich! My point is, we support immigrants whether they're here or not. So get over it.
9312 2018-11-01 05:24:39 Vinegar and oil sufficient!

9317 2018-11-01 05:23:52 Look back more thoughtfully. Oil prices hit the skids at the end of 2014. Prentice was Premier. Remember when he told Albertans “to look in the mirror”? It was over our drastic economic change. #ABNDP got handed a giant flaming bag of crap that had to be dealt with
9318 2018-11-01 05:23:34 Increase taxes on fuel....investigate oil Co. profits
Increase passenger taxes...investigate Auckland airport profits
Unilaterally grant RESIDENCY to a criminal....investigate immigration dept.
A pattern here?

あぶらさんの感動ポイントここなんですね…覚えとこ(？)

9367 2018-11-01 05:13:19 55555 อินกับฟิคอะ จะบ้า 
9368 2018-11-01 05:12:41 The Yorubas accept @atiku as long as #Lagos & the oil business is safe. The entrance of @MaziNnamdiKanu has entirely reversed #Nigeria to a state of helplessness & total depravity. The signs on the wall all point to #TotalRestorationOfBiafra.
9369 2018-11-01 05:12:23 Oya start the engagement.

And since Nigeria has been able to get another source of income different from oil since 1960 then I'm ready to talk without it.

My first engagement to you: prove the alternative source of wealth we as a country have. Let's push from there.
9370 2018-11-01 05:12:15 @shenoybv India signed $7bn defence deal with Russia to buy S400 air shield () From Nov India buy oil from Iran . Modi diplomacy worked bcz NO Sanction from US in either case () Ambassador K C Singh , @thewire_in @ndtv @sardesairajdeep @JhaSanjay @sagarikaghose just FYI
9371 2018-11-01 05:12:05 Bolton promises not to hurt ‘friends & allies’ after Trump reaffirms Iran oil embargo
9372 2018-11-01 05:12:04 Eucalyptus oil is my go to for everything. Never tried it on a transfer but I wish you luck.
9373 2018-11-01 05:11:54 Baby oil will work if you have any, or moisturiser is good for removing makeup as well :) put a little on a cotton pad and wipe it off
9374 2018-11-01 05:11:52 Why is Prop 112 a bad idea? It'll keep oil, gas, and fracking projects away from schools, occupied buildings, & other vulnerable areas. Why would you think that's a bad thing? It's Amendment 74 that's bad - not Prop 112.

9379 2018-11-01 05:11:37 Foolishness is natural man, so #oil must be secrets of the kingdom.   Are you buying the oil? To do so must be High Priest, not given to commoners.

9380 2018-11-01 05:11:33 Allow me to explain something, profit is essentially total revenue less total cost (TR-TC). If the driver is given 4k and spends the all amount on fuel and other expenses like topping up engine oil and stuff, he makes 0 profit. Hope u get it

9385 2018-11-01 05:10:32 No offence mate.
But I get my information from EXPERTS.
Not shock jocks, politicians who are backed by Fossil Fuel companies, big oil and coal, opinion columns in news papers, or random people on twitter.
I listen to EXPERTS and according to them, your are WRONG

9388 2018-11-01 05:10:10 Sounds like you need a basket for your deep fat fryer. Lift the basket, lower donuts into the oil slowly and avoid the splash burns.
9389 2018-11-01 05:10:10 That oil slick looking eye color is all I'm gonna be wearing. Just that. I want to dip my entire body in it.
9390 2018-11-01 05:10:07 Commodities that are vital to the USA's existence that was weaponized are the Dollar, the crude oil, and the internet itself. @KremlinRussia_E @mfa_russia @GovernmentRF @GermanyDiplo @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @AlibabaGroup
9391 2018-11-01 05:09:56 Which brands use Palm Oil? I know of @NutellaGlobal so I have stopped buying it
9392 2018-11-01 05:09:54 I think Skittles has Palm Oil in it. With the Orangutans estimated to go extinct within the next 10 years, I don't get why they're on there.
9393 2018-11-01 05:09:34 Visionless? 
Oga pls find another thing talk I take God name beg you.

If they engage you in sensible discussions now, you'll ask how much was oil then?

You people just use words anyhow.
9394 2018-11-01 05:09:25 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
9395 2018-11-01 05:09:23 Who are overcomers in Book of Revelation, those that overcome nature of the beast, all the soul ties.  Overcome foolishness, buy the oil… is how.

9400 2018-11-01 05:08:27 Oil breaks below 75. CAD took us down , CAD will make us go up
9401 2018-11-01 05:08:00 Do you know about olive oil’s anti-bacterial properties? Extra virgin olive oil has anti-bacterial properties. It is super effective against Helicobacter pylori which is bacteria that can cause stomach ulcers and even cancer.
9402 2018-11-01 05:07:43 We are getting ready to finish our season here in South Georgia with our 602 late model thanksgiving weekend. The lucas oil series never disappoints though! Plus having so many opportunities to go see them run fairly close to home
9403 2018-11-01 05:07:39 This man #LABron got me burning the midnight oil
9404 2018-11-01 05:07:35 Probbably we do not deserve to live on such a magnificant planet. We kill animals and other people. We poison our waters with toxic chemicals and fill the oceans with plastic trash.  We burn coal and drill dirty oil, just becouse of the profits. Is still time to change?
9405 2018-11-01 05:07:21 Why is it that apc is den of lie's. S/south governors went to Aso Rock villa to discuss  with Buhari about oil revenue derivation in there regions. See how clueless your party is.  Buhari knows why they here that's why he don't look at di face while shaking

9407 2018-11-01 05:06:55 I’ve heard they have catapults and boiling oil! They will probably sling it over the wall to hit us and get in. Maybe we should build a moat to slow them down!
9408 2018-11-01 05:06:47 หราาาา
9409 2018-11-01 05:06:39 Is it really so surprising? Fisc goal is always non-trivial esp with rising oil & govt pushes any lever it can. PSBs have lost a lot of market share and strict provisioning will lead to hard landing (0 lending & even more equity). Govt's stance is debatable but hardly a surprise

9421 2018-11-01 05:05:42 they're trying to make fun of native americans that protested and put their lives on the line to protect their homeland and water from being taken over by an oil company that wanted to build a big ass pipe right through their land.

conservatives are heartless weirdos

9489 2018-11-01 04:51:25 Sir, oil @ 74/- near lvl. and can move to 70-71/- from here but anything say under 70/- will be best considering the rupee devaluation from say 67-74(10%) so drop is neutralised here currently (12%) from 86 - 75/-usd for brent oil

9504 2018-11-01 04:47:52 So, your position on the oil money-soaked @WolfForPA?
9505 2018-11-01 04:47:21 @Oil_Drop Now, looking back, there are so many things I would have (could have) (should have) kept. Glad you still get pleasure from the McCovey card.
9506 2018-11-01 04:47:04 I have coconut oil in my eyes why does this always happen to me
9507 2018-11-01 04:46:59 Norway has 5 million people, 93% homogeneous white, which also has more oil per capita than any country I know of. But you’re right it’s mixed economy, but so is the USA, Sweden, etc. it’s depressing to say but Norway is ranked 25th most capitalist country by Cato, same by IOEF.
9508 2018-11-01 04:46:56 Tomi is in it for herself guys. She is a spoiled twerp. Candace is the right person to be representing us and our values and speaking out against the snake oil the left tries to sell.

9513 2018-11-01 04:46:09 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
9514 2018-11-01 04:46:06 Yes a stuck open pcv valve or malfunctioning one let's excessive oil into your air cleaner which then passes thru your throttle body an into the combustion chamber which could cause misfire in a cylinder worst case bent valves due to the excessive oil not being burnt off

9520 2018-11-01 04:45:24 I want intelligent discussions with intelligent people. You don't qualify.
It is the oil companies that now predict peak at 2030.
Tar oil is the most worthless oil of all. When the peak comes it is dead.

9539 2018-11-01 04:41:09 And it's going higher.  For reasons unknown there are those that think if we don't sell oil the world will use less.  All it does is cost Canadians $Bs, and send the $ to countries with far poorer standards than Canada, doing more harm than good.

9570 2018-11-01 04:33:52 Usually they do. But they know chaos is coming. Climate change. We must convert to sustainable energy - there goes their oil/gas/coal fortunes.
Climate change also is creating a global refugee crisis that we’re just beginning to see.

9571 2018-11-01 04:33:47 I know. Fracking is bad news because we don’t know what the final costs will be from an environmental & health standpoint. You should visit the Oil Heritage Region of PA @oilregion There is a ton of history of the oil industry (and a great microbrewery).

oil sands are dead in 5 years... 

plus, the smart money has already left.
9622 2018-11-01 04:22:48 Why not ?
Simple, because gas and oil are interchangeable and gas is cheap , and will remain cheap. There is a lot of gas around the world, 3 box mbtu. 
El gas es un iman para el crudo, por eso y con la ayuda del shale el crudo se hizo pomada en 2014. Se caerá a 50 usd

9642 2018-11-01 04:20:07 India and the United States face deadlines in the coming days to decide disputes over trade and oil. The president is most interested in motorcycle tariffs.
9643 2018-11-01 04:20:07 LOL as if Tomeh knows how to start a saw. She couldn’t put the gas in if you mixed the oil in for her.

9645 2018-11-01 04:19:51 Maybe an allude to "hoes don't get cold"? Does he know how to check and change the oil? Is his hairline trash? Is the d bigger than 5 inches? #qtna

9647 2018-11-01 04:19:13 @SanDiego350 loves our ocean (too warm) and freshwater, knowing their biological diversity.

As poor migrants focus US on the border, it's shocking to find that #oil Energy Transfer Partners' #pipeline$ put at risk both our #RioGrande #River (#Navajo) & @OgallalaAquifer (#Sioux)!

9649 2018-11-01 04:18:53 PSALM 133

1 Behold, how good and pleasant it is when brothers dwell in unity! 2 It is like the precious oil on the head, running down on the beard, on the beard of Aaron, running down on the collar of his robes! 3..For there the Lord has commanded the blessing, life forevermore
9650 2018-11-01 04:18:14 A lil bit of cbd oil in your pomade will do you wonderrrz friend
9651 2018-11-01 04:18:12 Agreed, if our market is buoyed on these shmucks, sink it and rebuild. The fed is killing us, not the bull! I pulled out and did some crypto... these snake oil salesmen play is daily
9652 2018-11-01 04:17:52 i found this olive oil capsule thingy and i squeezed it out to get the oil and put it on my hair and now i smell like peanut butter for some reason

9656 2018-11-01 04:17:14 Besides, if @ErinOTooleMP weren't such a... tool, he might be honest with his constituents and point out that the exemptions are to crown power companies, for coal generators already scheduled for long-term replacement. But that doesn't work with his oil shill narrative. #cdnpoli
9657 2018-11-01 04:17:10 USA first, US citizens first, NK negotiations, Japan, Mexico, Canada trade deals sets up China next. UK trade deal in the works. Military rebuild, rule of law, end birthright citizenship which is already illegal. Jobs, oil, trade and regulations overhaul.

9659 2018-11-01 04:17:05 Not to mention the Laffer curve is supposed to be about incentives. Norway’s %GDP is so high because of all the oil revenue. With a lower/higher rate, would there be more/less oil in the North Sea?

9665 2018-11-01 04:16:06 it was never about oil or the enviro, it was & is about CONTROL.....control of 'everything'.....humans, earth, weather, climate, rivers, food, $ everything.....we're being genocided by neo feudalists on a world scale..who are the ultimate control freaks & psychopaths.eugenicists.

9677 2018-11-01 04:15:03 I want my back massaged wit some oil 
9678 2018-11-01 04:14:50 Busy. I noticed traders get used to on buy or long strategy. They a bit hesitate for sell or short strategy.
 
I guess its something to do with em as full blood physical traders in oil co before joining this non commercial side of the trade.
9679 2018-11-01 04:14:48 I’m also allergic to olives/olive oil and apples. Allergic as in anaphylactic shock and emergency room time. I carry 3 epi-pens on me at all times considering how remote I usually am. Sucks.
9680 2018-11-01 04:14:30 Whatever their position was 10 years ago, you can't honestly tell me that you feel like @RachelNotley and her government haven't done everything to support the oil industry. 

Deal with what needs fixing within the #UCP. Throwing stones about a 10 year old story? Stop. #ableg
9681 2018-11-01 04:14:30 You and me both. Deep Fried Turkey is amazing...but it's so much trouble...

You gotta get the oil and the propane...and you have to find other people who may want a turkey fried because it doesn't make sense to use all that oil for just one turkey.

9691 2018-11-01 04:13:20 Rosewater is really so moisturizing to me without the oiliness of oil. I don’t think it’s a toner, but it’s really sooooo goood
9692 2018-11-01 04:13:18 Memudar nder, aku makenya sekitar 2 bulanan setiap hari buat bekas luka kena aspal di kaki, itu musti ekstra sabar, makenya pun di gosok gosok gitu kurleb 3 menit biar nyerep, kalo dioles doang ga mempan itu bio oil 
9693 2018-11-01 04:13:16 Luckily that water was so foul that I can’t imagine anyone drinking it. The former oil fields of NW WV & western PA were the first major U.S. producers.
9694 2018-11-01 04:12:52 Palm oil is unfortunately in many things.  I'm pretty sure I haven't got them all covered. Companies need to clean their products up a bit before saving the environment is too late.
9695 2018-11-01 04:12:20 A meal in 60 seconds! Ciabatta toasted with olive oil and cheddar cheese. Serve with pan-fried fried eggs.
9696 2018-11-01 04:12:15 And look how well that worked. When oil prices went down, AB economy was crushed under Con’s watch.  This gov is using incentives like the US states do to be competitive. Under this gov taxes got raised when? The incentives are a/b royalties. Take a look at PDP program
9697 2018-11-01 04:12:05 Black oil!!!
9698 2018-11-01 04:12:03 Yes, because destroying the planet is totally "feasible." 

Anyone who says solar isn't "feasible" has been mainlining oil company propaganda, and has no idea what they're talking about.
9699 2018-11-01 04:11:58 @taylorswift13 we who are concerned about our health, safety and welfare and want safer setbacks of 2500 feet from fracking sites wonder how you like this oil&gas industry-produced parody?

9775 2018-11-01 03:57:54 No, Palm oil although terrible for the orangutans is actually more sustainable than the land clearing that is going on (football fields per hour) to grow food for animal ag. When you are killing over 56 billion animals per year for food their food has to come from somewhere
9776 2018-11-01 03:57:44 Do you watch, read, or listen to the news? The #ABNDP have been fighting for TMX and for AB’s interests on Bill C-69.

9784 2018-11-01 03:56:13 there? Who wants to fish for deformed fish or try to find a deer amongst decimated forests and oil refineries? Because that's what will happen.
9785 2018-11-01 03:56:05 It's sad that so many are deluded and can't see what is right in front of them. The logic that the people who own the media--the elites who profit from war, oil pharma, etc.-- have every reason to lie to them, doesn't compute. It's media brain damage.

9792 2018-11-01 03:54:52 Yeah washing a cast iron skillet is different. It already being seasoned means it has the oil coatings to help it not rust over time but you’ll still have to season it occasionally. That’s why “tradition” is they should be passed down.

9938 2018-11-01 03:31:35 Just started back using coconut oil
9939 2018-11-01 03:31:24 They are right. It won’t be worth fighting over oil when there isn’t a clean drink of water to be had

9943 2018-11-01 03:31:07 while broadly speaking that migh be true, as I said, the key is in the objectives of the emerging power. USSR fell, it was relatively peaceful. n stable. mE was never allowed to stabilize itself, constant coups n interference for oil makes it hard to stabilise anything
9944 2018-11-01 03:30:57 ラブ伝わったいかんせん語彙力欠如オタクなのがあれなので伝わったなら！！！、またぜひやらしてください！！！

9953 2018-11-01 03:30:03 Oil and gas companies applying for permits up 400% so They could beat prop 112. So I guess losing all them jobs was a bunch of bull. Lol.
9954 2018-11-01 03:29:56 In addition to MORE revenue for counties like Turkana, ALL the revenue from oil, not most, should go into the marginalization fund to be spent SOLELY on development of Northern Kenya counties. If they overtake Nairobi in development, i’ll simply move there.

9965 2018-11-01 03:28:32 I hate that local legislators are debating laws about oil companies when oil companies should be against the law.
9966 2018-11-01 03:28:28 Mayo is great for the hair. I sometimes do a she’s butter coconut oil mask for my hair. I buy the Shea butter at Whole Foods. It’s organic and I melt it and I melt the coconut oil as it is a solid too. And on my dry hair I apply it and leave it five min. Mayo I leave 10.

9968 2018-11-01 03:28:10 Two stories is better than none! See, that would be half the chat. The rest of the time can be spent talking about beard oil and hat care products. 30 mins max.

9972 2018-11-01 03:26:46 A few drops of lemongrass oil after a shower sets the whole sleep mood

9975 2018-11-01 03:26:20 The brand I use is Spectrum Organic Unrefined Coconut Oil. I get it from Whole Foods in the personal care section. I use the plain one but there is also one by the same brand that is infused with lavender, if you like that scent.
9976 2018-11-01 03:26:13 I just saw a post by someone endorsing a beard oil ! And he had no beard

死ぬまでに童卒したいのでお手伝いしてください！
9985 2018-11-01 03:24:14 me blotting my face: lets get this oil 
9986 2018-11-01 03:24:09 I totally understand that it’s not like every single person who works in the oil industry is evil or that there aren’t some positive things being done or anything, but huge corporations are motivated by money & power and nothing else,
9987 2018-11-01 03:23:47 But oil was up in the last quarter.

9990 2018-11-01 03:23:13 @cbcnews The Middle East & it’s money is so self-assured that their money will ensure that the West will quietly nod its acquiescence - Eastern Canada burns Saudi oil & builds war machines for KSA - Khashoggi was so blatant - the journalists jumped on it bc one of THEM was killed
9991 2018-11-01 03:23:04 Sorry may castor oil kami di mapapanot nanay ko 
9992 2018-11-01 03:23:03 I don’t lol I be forgetting...but also I know an oil change is not as important as most people think..as long as u keep oil in your car it’ll run just fine
9993 2018-11-01 03:22:42 About 10 per cent of the funding for the statue came from the corporate social responsibility budgets of various public sector undertakings. Is this how the oil PSUs, for example, would have genuinely preferred to spend their cash?

9996 2018-11-01 03:22:12 What to use in Lieu of Pesticides? Neem Oil, Garlic & Clove Oil, Azatrol, StrawFlower Extract... the list goes on!
9997 2018-11-01 03:22:03 They believe that Russians changed votes in the 2016 election. That blacks are being gunned down by police based solely on the color of their skin.   Bush went to Iraq for oil.  Bush was behind 9/11. Man caused climate change.
9998 2018-11-01 03:21:50 Prepare the boiling oil!

10001 2018-11-01 03:21:36 Oh wow my oil is like 300 mg and I use it for work because I get sensory overload too often lmfaooo
10002 2018-11-01 03:21:30 Putin needs an oil shortage (fake) to drive up prices and give Trump/GOP cover to lift sanctions.
This was always the plan
10003 2018-11-01 03:21:28 FYI, Oil & Gas has spent $35,785,000 on 112 & sent death threats to the speaker of a rally in Greeley, CO urging voters to vote YES (rally was cancelled) - but those seeking to vote YES on 112 (ordinary citizens) have spent only $85,000. Polls = 112 gets YES, Oil/Gas loses.
