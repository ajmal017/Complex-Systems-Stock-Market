65 2018-02-26 23:54:45 Surely not those innocent people in syria coming in because of the oil your country needs ?
66 2018-02-26 23:54:27 My Dad's fondue was hot oil and raw meat boiling on the dining room table, always a good choice for his drunk friends...
67 2018-02-26 23:54:21 Saddam was a piece of shit to be sure, but that is not why the US invaded. It was end Arab socialism and liberate that oil market for capital. Look at everything Paul Bremer did after the war.
68 2018-02-26 23:54:19 Have you tried CBD oil for your anxiety?
69 2018-02-26 23:54:12 I believe when gas was last this high, oil was $150/barrel, what is it now, $64.  Build the refineries in CA, stop buying from the US.

72 2018-02-26 23:53:57 everyone keeps ignoring 2 more indications for and against an early election:
for: erdogan just announced cheaper oil for farmers recently.
against: the reason the presidential election was set in 2019 was to keep his 5year term since 2014,allowing 2x5 more yrs for him after that

80 2018-02-26 23:52:46 It’s #SuperTrump: "I really believe I would have patched the Exxon Valdez before enough oil leaked out to damage even one shorebird.”
81 2018-02-26 23:52:31 And yes, I'm working hard to tour EU. It will happen, your awake and my not so woke will collide one day and there will be laughs and coconut oil.
82 2018-02-26 23:52:29 In other words, George Bush and Dick Cheney  oil grabbing policy! He is learning!
83 2018-02-26 23:52:23 Lovely cars. My XK8 shares the same basic engine as yours, but V8. (Think pistons etc Al same). The AJ is Jaguar. Developed from an older V12 (can't recall Which).

One piece of advice though: you cannot change oil enough. Every 5,000 miles is good. Found out the hard way!
84 2018-02-26 23:51:44 I don’t care for rapists & pedophiles. And those who remove all clean air & water regulations and sign Bill to allow mentally insane to buy guns. More reading of legislation is a good idea. Think of the next oil spill. We’ve had plenty off shore. Mine sludge now in Rivers LEGAL

90 2018-02-26 23:51:19 @DarylFransoo Do you know how Rockefeller grew his oil business and his wealth? He  controlled the railroads. When his competitors did get to ship their  oil, they paid a premium. The same method can be used to control grain  and politics. Think hard about that.
91 2018-02-26 23:51:08 2/2 Any potential revenue #Lebanon receives from oil & gas fields, will go straight to #Hezbollah. However, the oil & gas fields they’re after are Israel’s, and they [#Lebanon & #Hezbollah] know it.  It will be interesting to see how this all develops.

97 2018-02-26 23:50:26 Try this to repair your damage wet it , get some hair mayonnaise and wet it again and use some coconut oil
98 2018-02-26 23:50:18 @realDonaldTrump  wants to give away our seas and shores, but up our dangerous exposure to oil spills; payoff somewhere???
99 2018-02-26 23:50:10 Here is my unscientific theory. I make my own meals almost every day, with lots of olive oil, meat, sometimes even lard. Yet I stay at a healthy weight and don't binge on food. I think it is because I feel very satisfied with hearty food.
100 2018-02-26 23:50:10 า
101 2018-02-26 23:50:05 Just watched a guy put 5qts of oil in his Ford Focus at Casey poor car!!

105 2018-02-26 23:48:59 @TrillestAC 1. Chicken, lemon, thyme, salt &amp; pepper, and olive oil.

107 2018-02-26 23:48:35 Fish oil? My best guess.
108 2018-02-26 23:48:26 it’s just a matte green that I swiped some face oil on top of so it made it shiny and discolored!!!

111 2018-02-26 23:48:06 I recommend DoTerra’s Frankincense oil. You can apply it directly but would recommend diluting w/fractionated coconut oil or Vitamin E lotion till you see how your skin interacts. I also put a couple drops directly in my mouth, you can do that 1-2x/day.
112 2018-02-26 23:47:38 Just a reminder for writers: YOU CAN WRITE ANYWHERE! I was just revising while my car got a oil change! #WritingLife
113 2018-02-26 23:47:30 I'd hate to burn the midnight oil.I really wanna go back to sleep but am struggling!!The night is absurd!!
114 2018-02-26 23:47:12 What a perfect time to run out of oil for the heating  Anyone have a spare blanket? #BeastFromTheEast #ireland #BleedinFreezin
115 2018-02-26 23:46:57 Anyone have experience with animals on CBD oil? After the first day my cat is still an asshole.
116 2018-02-26 23:46:52 Oil is good for wood (tomatoes aren’t)
117 2018-02-26 23:46:50 Well we do need refined oil. Kinda sucks the companies making huge $$ have no interest in providing Canadians with it.
118 2018-02-26 23:46:45 Site C, mining, oil and gas....
119 2018-02-26 23:46:35 How can non-oil MENA countries develop anti-fragile economies ? Can Switzerland-like decentralized democratic systems flourish south of the Mediterranean ?
PS: oil as in petroleum, olive oil doesn't count.
120 2018-02-26 23:46:34 HONEST QUESTION:

Extra Light Olive Oil...why? 
#FoodieChats
121 2018-02-26 23:46:19 Action? We are arming the jihadi terrorists that are bombing Damascas (dont mention that though). After much bloodshed we'll get what we always wanted, an oil pipeline. Dont worry once we start the bombing you want see the kids dying on tv.
122 2018-02-26 23:46:18 If you really want to ruin an otherwise pleasant evening drop a jar of sun-dried tomatoes on your wooden kitchen floor and enjoy.

That oil gets everywhere.
123 2018-02-26 23:46:13 CBD Oil is #HealthyLiving
124 2018-02-26 23:46:00 THE SQUEAKY WHEEL GETS THE OIL
125 2018-02-26 23:45:43 Do municipalities have the authority to ban oil terminals and transportation or crude? These are regulated by Feds.
126 2018-02-26 23:45:39 How about doing real job @ EPA that would benefit everyone, not just your oil co friends? Clean Air Act & Clean Water Act r both imp & must continue even if u don't believe climate chg. Don't want 2 see air I'm breathing as example.
127 2018-02-26 23:45:04 And told it was running out. Plenty heading out to work in the North Sea now as the oil industry picks up – and the price.

129 2018-02-26 23:44:53 I have been watching socialism at work in Venezuela. Starving people in the streets being tear gassed by their government. Oil rich to starvation in less than 16 years...what say you Bernie? This is what you want for us???

132 2018-02-26 23:44:28 Us must stay out of this huge mess. NATO must stop it. Iran/turkey/syria/Russia... all fighting for oil. Human life is nothing to them. Syria is rubble over oil. Stop this insanity.

134 2018-02-26 23:44:20 Those upgraders should have been built 35 years ago. If the PC's had invested back then, we'd be light years closer to actually weaning off oil. Spinning it any other way is disingenuous and you know it.
135 2018-02-26 23:44:09 *goes to dealership for oil change
Dealership: "How can we help you?"
Me: "Just need an oil change."
Dealership: "Sooooo, you need a new car?"
Me: "What?, no, O.I.L. C.H.A.N.G.E!"
Dealership: "Ooooo, ha ha, I apologize. So here's our 2018 mode............."
136 2018-02-26 23:44:02 i have such bad dandruff today, someone please rub coconut oil onto my scalp!
137 2018-02-26 23:44:02 Made my own hair spritz and I couldn't be happier, my dry, coil, stubby hair feels so supple. I mixed: 
Good old h2O, coconut oil, leave-in conditioner, glycelrine and eucalyptus oil

Crossing my fingers, hope this works @GirlTalkZA
138 2018-02-26 23:44:00 Nice abuse of government power. So you're saying NRA = Conservatives and ANY opposition to the @NRA is an attack on conservatives? Hardly. Nice to see honesty from your party of snake oil salesmen.

141 2018-02-26 23:43:39 Walmart got vitamin E oil?
142 2018-02-26 23:43:33 1/2 I feel this explains why #Hezbollah & #Lebanon has developed a sudden interest in offshore gas & oil in Eastern Mediterranean. I believe they know their drug trade is finished, and they’re hoping to diversify their revenue streams.

145 2018-02-26 23:43:05 Just put a screw in my oil pan to stop a leak, ultimate junkyard mechanic. @ me if you need something hacked together 
146 2018-02-26 23:43:02 #BeardCare Tip 3. Put a few drops of beard oil on your fingertips, and apply them deep into your whiskers. It’s a wake-up call that makes your face want to say, “Good morning, Sir.”
147 2018-02-26 23:43:01 Air intake and oil-filter maintenance should be conducted every 2,000 hrs. Monitor the oil filter for contamination and wear metals, leading indicators that air-end maintenance is required.

148 2018-02-26 23:42:59 10/10!!!! I HAVE HER PRIMER AND I JUST LOVE IT. keeps my makeup in place and nice all day and helps with coverage even tho it's just a PRIMER and my face doesn't oil up by the end of the day
149 2018-02-26 23:42:56 @getnickwright no suspension. Now shut the fuck up. Worry bout rubbing baby oil on LeBron. We all know you would pimp.
150 2018-02-26 23:42:56 Suncor has closed a deal to buy a 5% stake in Syncrude from Mocal Energy for $925 million. Suncor's share in Syncrude is now 58.74%, while Imperial Oil has 25%, Sinopec 9.03% and Nexen 7.23%.

151 2018-02-26 23:42:54 Some oils are perfectly safe 4 animals as long as they are diluted w/a carrier oil. I had a cat who became OCD about grooming her belly. When I would catch her I would massage a little of a blend, including lavender, into the tips of her ears & on the pads of her feet. No issues.

154 2018-02-26 23:42:05 Coloca Midnight Oil pra se inspirar
155 2018-02-26 23:42:04 I guess the natural gas that is buried with the oil deposits cost more than the cost of nuclear reactors?
156 2018-02-26 23:42:03 Oil... half of what the US is today
157 2018-02-26 23:41:49 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.
158 2018-02-26 23:41:49 Plus he looks like Olive Oil after she swallowed a lemon.
159 2018-02-26 23:41:35 A little bit of virgin olive oil and antibacterial dish soap
160 2018-02-26 23:41:05 I don’t see how Canada having the 3rd largest oil reserves to service the growing oil demand of the rest of the world has nothing to do with this discussion? It’s the basis of this discussion? You said yourself the oil is for China?
161 2018-02-26 23:40:55 Nice try, but I’m not a democrat, nor am I a Republican. However, I am a 100% patriot. Just remember a 5x draft dodger, a serial sexual assaulter, a traitor charlatan hijacked Lincoln’s party & sold snake oil to 1/3 of this nation as a cure for total failure of a bankrupt Party.
162 2018-02-26 23:40:33 美少年は今日も可愛いなー！
163 2018-02-26 23:40:25 Good beard oil lol
164 2018-02-26 23:40:18 いや…ちょ、やめろっ！耳からはさすがに油飲めないから！
165 2018-02-26 23:40:16 This sounds like a good idea, however it also means more dept for our province. Are the oil companies going to chip in some how since they will profit most? I like cause there will be jobs for Albertans but the shitty moves still outnumber the good ones. Still an undecided voter.
166 2018-02-26 23:40:15 A civilization that was still in the Stone Ages. Western Canada would never have been the wheat and oil producing powerhouse it is now!! Capitalism allowed the west to reach its potential.
167 2018-02-26 23:40:08 Lavender oil!
168 2018-02-26 23:39:55 I'll have to try out some Rose oil! I smelled it the other day at a friend & it smelled amazing. I love using essential oils and I love when other people do too! :)
169 2018-02-26 23:39:34 The 1st 10 mins shows how out of touch you are. Comparing NHS to nuclear, oil and airline industries is an insult. The latter are paid highly for their skills but  the NHS remains underfunded with bursaries cancelled. Yes pilots need sleep but they don’t work over their hours!!
170 2018-02-26 23:39:20 I say we vote out anyone paid off by the oil and gas industry.

172 2018-02-26 23:39:07 When you say most soy is consumed by animals are you including bean meal the bi  product of soy oil extraction? What else could be done with it?
173 2018-02-26 23:38:55 My coconut oil is still solid. Barcelona, what’s going on mate?
174 2018-02-26 23:38:30 This body oil I have on has ppl really stopping me asking me “ Damn you smell good? What do you have on? I smell you across the desk / parking lot! #mylife
175 2018-02-26 23:38:26 The younger they are it’s better to dilute with a carrier oil, like fractionated coconut oil. When I need to apply our Deep Blue oil, for pain management, to my feet, I use Vitamin E lotion.
176 2018-02-26 23:38:21 My pleasure
177 2018-02-26 23:38:16 Oh yes, they do...
178 2018-02-26 23:38:11 90 ‘/,of VancouverGas is from Alberta but BC opposes twinning the pipeline to export it ?
Quebec & Ontario buy Rail  Oil from USA (1 US train explosion killed 27) also import Tanker Oil fr Saudi Sheiks (who treat women poorly) & Tanker oil fr Venezuela’s Killer-Dictator. 
WTF
179 2018-02-26 23:37:40 Ugh I need some oil sheen
180 2018-02-26 23:37:35 This wild grow oil stinks so bad It just gave me a headache
181 2018-02-26 23:37:31 I'm depressed because I felt like I'm alone I wish it could work out for my mother and I I wish I was different a man with no disability work in the Oil patch with a wife and two kids and going on trips if I was normal would my mother love me I wish I was normal without fear
182 2018-02-26 23:37:08 Canada's reserves are expensive to access, and with global prices lowering, we can't compete with the much cheaper Saudi Arabian oil (less than $10/barrel versus more than $25/barrel in Canada). It stops being worth the cost of extraction.

Still unrelated to the original topic.
183 2018-02-26 23:36:49 Please tell me you're not one of those Subaru owners who insist the service department put on Fox News in the waiting area. Ruins my whole day when I go for an oil change.
184 2018-02-26 23:36:37 Folatil Oil Dlm Jahe Sudah Sejak Dulu Tbukti Bisa Mngatasi Problem Penyumbatan Hidung Dan Sesak Nafas
185 2018-02-26 23:36:33 When new technology increases the ease with which natural resources can be extracted, the economy flourishes. Until the resource is tapped out and collapse occurs. We are extracting oil and gas so rapidly with high-pressure steam/detergent injections, global economy is spiking.
186 2018-02-26 23:36:14 I used to work for the oil industry Peter, this has been a theme for the last 20 years... alas. Turning into a reality now.
187 2018-02-26 23:36:09 Love the smell of dragons blood. I used to make massage oil with dragons blood essential oil. So good.
188 2018-02-26 23:36:07 Doesn't this guy look like a snake oil salesman. Do you need further proof that Berniecrats are the nutjobs on the Democratic side? Also see their endorsement of outerspace Alien lover Kucinich. #kevindeleon
189 2018-02-26 23:36:05 I hope you slip in peanut oil hoe
190 2018-02-26 23:36:04 I think you guys prayed for me because my oil change was free lol
191 2018-02-26 23:35:45 The UK and US are doing quite a lot. They are funding the terrorists and thus prolonging the war. All for a bloody oil pipiline!
192 2018-02-26 23:35:43 かわいいよ！！！
193 2018-02-26 23:35:43 It depends on the bread. Usually I use butter. I use a mix of olive oil & butter if it's a dipping bread.
194 2018-02-26 23:35:42 Think my oil boiler is grant also,  about eighteen years old and has only been cleaned never serviced
195 2018-02-26 23:35:02 Right? Can’t he just slither in oil and shadap?
196 2018-02-26 23:34:56 Saudi Arabia has neared burning 3,000,000 barrels of oil a day for:
Air conditioning
Transportation
Industrial uses 

Wow, there’s a number. Thanks @VancouverSun
197 2018-02-26 23:34:55   I hit a pothole and I think it fucked up a sensor. My oil light came on, I got an oil change and that shit still on 
198 2018-02-26 23:34:50 Yeah, it's a pretty shitty metric, the fake god twitter account has 4.5 million followers.

202 2018-02-26 23:34:28 It was built on site over a century ago.  No grants. Just a big oil patch drilling program. Steeled up 9 buildings a couple years ago.
203 2018-02-26 23:34:22 I believe the team closest to Man City (as i believe they will finish 2nd) is Liverpool and they don’t have oil or gangster money
204 2018-02-26 23:34:11 Boli And oil
205 2018-02-26 23:34:05 Got a shed load of snake oil to unload.

216 2018-02-26 23:31:13 I cut out a lot of gluten and use Pacifica face wash twice daily with grape seed oil as my moisturizer.
217 2018-02-26 23:30:58 I'm right there with you, shitting my pants in fear, cashing my 401k for guns, rubbing gun oil on my body as a sort of salve. Thes lieberals got me so scared I tell you what... I'm going through a 6 pack of underwear a day.
218 2018-02-26 23:30:57 Alaskans own 490 shares of ISRAEL CORP LTD/THE, worth $91,549. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in ISRAEL.
219 2018-02-26 23:30:46 Haven't been able to figure out the politicians reasoning in all this. Even the so called environmentalists rationale. If we don't sell Asia etc. oil, they don't go without. They buy elsewhere. To what purpose do we hamstring Canada?
220 2018-02-26 23:30:43 I have a meeting with a QC in 15 mins so of course my face is an oil slick and I have no makeup here 
221 2018-02-26 23:30:37 just got an oil change. You bums can’t tell me shit 
222 2018-02-26 23:30:28 I accidentally put vitamin e oil on my face and I usually do it before bed cuz it makes my vision blurry but oh well maybe it will help me paint or something
223 2018-02-26 23:30:25 Pick the one that isn’t made with earth/life destroying palm oil.

227 2018-02-26 23:28:55 All this hype about the fuckin weather is doing me ed in!!! Every time you come in there is some eejit tellin ya to check your oil, stay warm don`t go out unless you have too..ITS A BIT OF A COLD SPELL...#ffs
228 2018-02-26 23:28:53 For the second year in a row, @MoRepEvans and I were able to present legislation about CBD oil. Special thanks to BeLeaf Company, Noah’s Arc, and Veterans for Compassionate Access. Hopefully we can pass this and expand care for more Missourians! #moleg
229 2018-02-26 23:28:35 butter or oil is a matter of taste or try a half/half combo.. lol.. if you have some cash find some walnut oil.. just be careful with it cause it can go rancid pretty fast..
230 2018-02-26 23:28:10 try sugar & salt bath & exfoliate w| both after,  then shower w| rose oil & shea butter soap from @SheaMoisture
231 2018-02-26 23:28:07 I truely get the oil thing but it was yr swearing...classic lmao response. Nothing like a tirade of cuss words!
232 2018-02-26 23:28:04 Is it usual to have brake oil smear wheel hub caps?
233 2018-02-26 23:27:50 I am glad sza talked about coconut oil drying out her hair. It does the same for me. I legit only use castor oil, water and leave in to keep my hair moisturized.
234 2018-02-26 23:27:49 @AndrewScheer will u drop the #carbontax when u take office?. It clearly is and will be an economy killer. Ppl want cleaner enviro yes but go after big polluters like airlines ships oil companies. We cannot afford the charade much longer.
235 2018-02-26 23:27:46 @93XRT @jasonthomas93 you’re killing me with Midnite Oil. Even the Aboriginal people are sick of this 30 plus year old song that you play way too much. Those beds are burnt.
236 2018-02-26 23:27:05 my fave moisturiser is cetaphil, n i use duac gel for acne. I hate coconut oil on face so im in yr situation! Sudocrem is good too for really sore spots x
237 2018-02-26 23:27:03 MPP Micro Press. Good blow out and a drop of oil in each corner and drops in nicely. Far more appealing than a $xxxx lens.

245 2018-02-26 23:25:51 Recent deterioration in security in Kirkuk province is complicated but there's a simple reason that is being ignored: Da'ish engaged in the theft of large amounts of oil under the noses of the Peshmerga. #Iraq's forces put an end to that & now sleeper cells have been activated.

248 2018-02-26 23:25:06 Give a thought to the oil distributors. Country gone mad
249 2018-02-26 23:24:53 Where is the ingredients list online ? Nearly all Avon lippy contains castor seed oil, which I'm allergic to.  How can people with serious allergies safely purchase cosmetics when companies aren't displaying ingredients!
250 2018-02-26 23:24:48 My point is you’re justifying something you do and failing to see my point. I get yours. Let people enjoy things. But I want to instruct yoga to help people improve. Yoga & beer are water & oil. I like both. But they don’t really mix regardless of people’s enjoyment in it.
251 2018-02-26 23:24:44 Bad news: prosecutors have increased my charges. So this Fri I will now be answering FOUR charges not two. For giving FREE cannabis oil to ppl that were sick and dying.

252 2018-02-26 23:24:38 With oil paint stains because why not be bruiting and artistic
253 2018-02-26 23:24:26 British & Compromise are linguistically queer bedfellows. Like oil & water, the 2 seldom mix.  The Telegraph may well think it's  Outrageous, but living as I do,  in this sectarian, putrid backwater, well I think the suggestion from Brussels is a splendid idea. Seconded
254 2018-02-26 23:24:11 it kinda depends on what kind of crust you're looking for.. butter or oil will tend to make the top 'soft' so if you're making sandwich type bread you might want that.. if you're making baguettes or artisan/rustic style you might want it to be hard/crunchy so then no..

258 2018-02-26 23:23:32 Now where am I gonna find eucalyptus oil....
259 2018-02-26 23:23:24 I can some things on GoFundMe, but there's a lot of stuff that people get for free. If you need food, there are food banks & food stamps for most anyone. Electric & oil bills already have programs for those qualify. Hospitals don't turn anyone away.
260 2018-02-26 23:23:13 I think we are approaching a turning point in overall sentiment towards energy stocks but we'll see.  With the type of results expected of $CPG, it will be very hard to ignore.  Investors are starting to curiously look at Canada oil again because of ridiculous undervalue.
261 2018-02-26 23:23:09 The decision of the field to abandon post Keynesian work because of some oil inflation is not at issue here.
262 2018-02-26 23:23:08 All I needed was some coconut oil.

269 2018-02-26 23:21:54 Only reason I saw this segment (Not a View watcher lol) is because I was getting my oil changed. It was fun to watch as the ladies weren't expecting the facts he laid out for them. Well done!

273 2018-02-26 23:21:22 Unless you realize the costs it has on children collecting the patented hazelnuts and the effect of palm oil deforestation on reducing the natural habitat of many species. So "ok" seems more subjective than it appears here..

You understand that solar, railroads, even oil were all subsidized/encouraged using bills? Anything else?
279 2018-02-26 23:21:09 I am talking about making our politicians think of the future and create jobs with clean renewable energy instead of the dirty commodity we extract dirty oil. we can gradually transition to it -it is possible.

282 2018-02-26 23:21:00 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.
283 2018-02-26 23:21:00 9/11 was planned so U.S. had an excuse to take Iraq oil. Call me crazy
284 2018-02-26 23:20:54 His cup final appearances are great but the only way this roster is fixed quickly is via trade and that is not his speciality. If you believe it is, don't know what you are looking at.

286 2018-02-26 23:20:24 Getting an oil change and this young man is trying to sell me a car, but he needs a haircut and he gave me his Instagram to follow him 
I swear these things only happen to me.
287 2018-02-26 23:20:23 No I mean the adulting like taking cars for oil changes and cleaning them bc adulting
288 2018-02-26 23:20:15 Oh then u might want to try ginger, but only scrub for  couple of minutes, helps eliminate oil, I use around my nose.
289 2018-02-26 23:20:15 But in all honesty, I have killed my Curls. So from now on deva curl products only  and coconut oil 
290 2018-02-26 23:20:04 Does anyone whose stress manifests in their mouth recommend solutions to gum and tongue pain: I've been hydrating like mad, numbed with Camphor oil, rinsed with apple cider vinegar mix and later peroxide, used black tea bag compresses, and more salt water swishes than I can count
291 2018-02-26 23:19:55 Full tank of gas and an oil change for my 2014 Chevy : $130

293 2018-02-26 23:19:34 LOL I just got my oil changed and new tires and the guy was pulling my car around and it connected to my phone and started blasting Ghostmane  he looked so shocked
294 2018-02-26 23:19:29 I'm listening and I'm absolutely fed up. I refuse to vote for ANY party or politicians who don't stand up and absolutely promise in writing to do EVERYTHING in their power to bring our oil and gas resources to world markets. This has gone beyond stupid.

304 2018-02-26 23:18:33 Oil on wood! It’s amazing 
305 2018-02-26 23:18:29 use olive oil instead
306 2018-02-26 23:18:26 very possible! fish are a great source of healthy fats; salmon, mackerel, the list goes on. you can basically just substitute meat for fish and be fine. you'd still want to rely on things like avocado, olive oil, etc to make sure you're getting more fat than protein though!

319 2018-02-26 23:16:47 That’s not extremes. That’s reality. We will depend on oil for generations. And global demand is rising. We can debate all day long if you like, but fact are facts.

328 2018-02-26 23:16:03 Relationship problems? Coconut oil to save lives.
329 2018-02-26 23:15:57 So I've been brushing my teeth with coconut oil/baking soda/turmeric for a month now and my teeth are SOOOOO much whiter.
330 2018-02-26 23:15:43 Well, "a hand out" is government writing a poor person person a check, or subsidizing an oil company, or paying interest to bond holders.  Right?  So, I asked:  What do you think government should fund instead?
331 2018-02-26 23:15:35 BREITBART: Rarely use an essential oil.
332 2018-02-26 23:15:23 But you LOVE buying Texas and Alaska oil, don't you, hypocrite?

334 2018-02-26 23:15:02 are you massaging your scalp with it as well? also try using tea tree or sunflower seed oil, i believe they also stimulate hair growth

341 2018-02-26 23:13:59 It's not even that great. It's just like some sesame oil fish sauce and some ginger. It's really salty.
342 2018-02-26 23:13:54 You mean a $3.2 Billion set of subsidies from #taxpayers every year is not enough for Big Oil to turn a profit?  What is wrong with this picture? #bcpoli #cdnpoli #fossilfuels #pipeline #ThingsPeopleShouldKnow
343 2018-02-26 23:13:26 the jobs lost when oil spills kill tourism and fisheries are not included in this. Off-shore drilling is destructive and not needed.
344 2018-02-26 23:13:24 @wrcase I have a question about my hobo knife. I've had it for about a month I've used it and washed it but occasionally it still tastes like it has oil on it. Is this normal?
345 2018-02-26 23:13:23 Can hemp oil replace oil in our vehicles ?
346 2018-02-26 23:13:19 You are far more confident than I...as his resume suggests no such ability.
347 2018-02-26 23:13:14 Ginger cinnamon sugar scrub, afterwards toner with rose water and apply a mix of wheat oil and coconut oil. And a last finish of jelly Vaseline daily before bed. Works as magic with me and all natural

355 2018-02-26 23:11:51 #ThingsPeopleShouldKnow Truffle oil is not made from truffles; it’s an olive oil with additives to mimic the flavor of truffles. So that $8 truffle popcorn you just ordered? It actually cost about 25¢ to make; you’re just a sucker.
356 2018-02-26 23:11:48 Is snake oil rich in vitamin C and thiamine?

Offshore drilling "will" (not might) eventually spill oil in our waters killing off what we eat as well as destroy our beaches and the tourists will go somewhere else.  Please don't do this

There is significant anecdotal evidence as to the efficacy of cannabis oil in curing cancer; however, the cost is approx $50k from CT's dispensaries. Who can afford that? Then there's maintenance.

423 2018-02-26 23:03:18 Yes they have oil money but how they use it is what makes them “socialist”
424 2018-02-26 23:03:17 Please don't make me drag out the article on the teacher that died by saving money on tamiflu this year.
You are worth every penny of the big pharma snake oil
425 2018-02-26 23:03:06 Yup. All this BS over an oil change. I can’t believe it.
426 2018-02-26 23:02:46 It answers so many questions about WTH is going on in our political system & why Putin was so hot to get Trump elected. Just like Iraq: it's all about the Robber Oil Barons.
427 2018-02-26 23:02:37 I view it as a lot of education needed. Try looking yourself.
I served my country not to watch it fall apart at greedy politicians protecting oil companies and special interest. Spare me your lecture. I have seen the oil sands they send us to fight for.

430 2018-02-26 23:02:16 I always forget how much my brother & dad baby me when it comes to fixing cars until a maintenance light comes on. With that being said, any man out there wanna help me with my oil? 
431 2018-02-26 23:02:15 You look at as negativity whereas I view it as a realistic approach that keeps one grounded and from being disappointed when expectations aren't realistic. To each his own.

435 2018-02-26 23:01:36 They won’t I’m afraid! Too much money involved & that overrides any ethical damage it causes. Indonesia puts pressure on every time EU threatens anything to limit #killerpalmoil usage. We must educate people, i drive my colleagues mad saying can’t eat that, it contains palm oil!

438 2018-02-26 23:01:04 Oh girl I got the car towed to the shop & raised hell. Like why would an oil change turn into all of this. Absolutely ridiculous

441 2018-02-26 23:00:47 S/o to Cheryl man. I literally called her like 3 minutes ago bawling and hysterical because I knew I was gonna get yelled at for not getting my oil changed.  I know she hates when it’s that time

446 2018-02-26 23:00:23 By making a deal on the oil and gas companies' terms? You DO know that taxes can be raised on them WITHOUT making some type of "deal" and making sure they are OK with it, right? Don't give away my property rights because those companies "want something in return."

455 2018-02-26 22:59:20 That's a false equivalence.

Just because we have a current reliance on something, doesn't mean we need to rely on it. 

Getting Canadian "oil" out of the ground is expensive (compared to global market values), and environmentally destructive. Benefits for Canada are very low.
456 2018-02-26 22:59:18 The tweet was mainly about the Assad must go curse. It is partly about oil and gas, however. #US forces sit right on top of #Syria's largest gas field #Conoco. #US bombed syrian forces trying to retake this area.  #Trump said the US should have taken Iraq's oil.
457 2018-02-26 22:59:10 That’s rich coming from a guy whose party tried to dupe voters into believing Scotland’s next oil boom was just around the corner during #indyref. And look what happened then... 
458 2018-02-26 22:59:08 looks like a lot of drama to a OLD guy--jus sayin--but you did need a seeing eye dog to get through the oil smoke--
459 2018-02-26 22:58:57 Are we talking olive oil dumb? Or engine oil dumb?
460 2018-02-26 22:58:51 All of our politicians are embezzling our  monies. Imagine a country as big as Nigeria produces oil and can't afford to build a refinery? Funny how things turns out in Nigeria. We do have lot of natural resources and God bless us with fertile land @ProfOsinbajo @MBuhari @NGRPresi

464 2018-02-26 22:58:27 At the risk of stretching an analogy... oil was a nuisance before the internal combustion engine.

467 2018-02-26 22:58:07 The banks have to know they will probably demand divestiture of oil companies next.

484 2018-02-26 22:56:46 Then why do the #HouseofSaud have continued access to weapons and UK funds for their Oil? Why is there no Sanctions on Saudi who sponsor these mosques that radicalise?
485 2018-02-26 22:56:45 Do you know of anyone who has studied or explored CBD oil as something to help with the pain? I know for a fact it can be very effective for a wide range of issues (joint inflammation, back pain, post concussion syndrome) with little to no side effects.
486 2018-02-26 22:56:42 I used to buy the almond oil one. I lovedddd it. I think after my scalp cleared up I stopped using it like a dummy.
487 2018-02-26 22:56:42 3/ have you ever heard of Greenpeace, or any protesters for that matter, trying to stop Saudi Arabia, Nigeria or Venezuela from developing their resources? Of course now. And Canada is conflict free ethical oil, unlike other countries. The world needs more Canada oil.
488 2018-02-26 22:56:38 Umm, a useful definition of a monopoly would be a business so entrenched that market forces cannot punish it. If Standard Oil was allowed to continue without intervention, does he really think it wouldn’t be dominant today?

515 2018-02-26 22:53:46 You act like they would have a choice if the state increased taxes on gas and oil. You don't ask if WE are OK when you raise OUR (individual) taxes on income, sales, fuel, property, etc.

518 2018-02-26 22:53:08 I’d say that there’s not enough oil there or not at all, to justify a war for “peace, freedom and democracy” like in Irak or Afganistan..

Ghee/duck fat is far more versatile.
528 2018-02-26 22:51:54 @WarrenBuffett I still want to work for you. I called the oil price move higher after the game changing decision by the Saudi's to stop exporting to the USA. I now predict a recession in the Eurozone. see next
529 2018-02-26 22:51:39 A good life hack that's actually worth trying out is pouring 2-3 drops of olive oil or coconut oil into your bath and you won't need to cream yourself when you come out
530 2018-02-26 22:51:30 Nice! 
531 2018-02-26 22:51:28 They flourish also because they have OIL, my dear.
532 2018-02-26 22:51:15 I am aware that as one fossil fuel (coal) declines oil will continue for quite a time so I  favour pipelines seeing them as safer and rendering greater profit. Keeping in mind that one day oil will also decline so we have to stay ahead of the declines by developing replacements

552 2018-02-26 22:49:42 You think this is about oil? The US is an $18T dollar economy.   A lot of things have changed. The US is an oil exporter now. It is less than 10% of US economy. It is over 50% of Russias’. For Russia it’s oil, for the US it is not.

564 2018-02-26 22:47:22 So my gf went to go get the oil change done on my car and instead of paying 65 dollars she got the guy to charge her only 25 dollars if that ain’t love idk what is.
565 2018-02-26 22:47:09 Oh, and I toss the veggies in olive oil, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.
566 2018-02-26 22:47:08 So you write bad about them because negativity sells? Or you just hate the team? Or you use to love them. I'm just wondering.
567 2018-02-26 22:47:02 A coworker told me to try coconut oil as a moisturizer before make up and i honestly am worried for her
568 2018-02-26 22:46:59 God provided the tools to move humanity forward. One tool is empathy, the other is oil.

572 2018-02-26 22:46:39 Chop it and fry it in salty oil and then scramble eggs with onions pepper (bell and scotch bonnet) with tomato stew
573 2018-02-26 22:46:37 Oh please - just shut the F up!!!  You are just nothing more than mouthpieces for the NRA, the Koch brothers, the oil companies... basically any organization with money out to screw over the American public — GET LOST!!
574 2018-02-26 22:46:32 I don't know where you're from but Bio Oil has really helped my scars heal and fade. And for the rest. Time...
575 2018-02-26 22:46:26 Exactly! Coal industry controlled this state for decades. We can not let the @WVGOP to allow oil/gas industry to do the same thing.  No more lobbyists calling the shots! We need to invest in renewable energy. #55Strong

577 2018-02-26 22:46:17 I was gifted an ‘oil free’ fryer for my birthday last month and ‘oil free’ frying is now my religion.
578 2018-02-26 22:46:14 Hell, who doesn't, amirite??? I fry mushrooms, onions, garlic, peppers and chillis. This gives the soup a meaty, roasted flavour. I'm also not shy with the rapeseed oil for body.

580 2018-02-26 22:46:05 I'd say those "Sensing" / "Feeling" tasks e.g. coffee with customers to seek feedback or  meeting someone from the oil & gas sector to have a direct "feel" of the market.
581 2018-02-26 22:46:04 WTF...
582 2018-02-26 22:45:59 Some truth in that, but you could go Hi-Fat-Lo-Carb, eat a ton of calories and still lose weight. Insulin resistance is probably the biggest factor not so much from calories per se, but from carbs, processed fats like corn oil, and other corn products (yes, chips, also HFCS).
583 2018-02-26 22:45:59 To the guy at the oil change place: I don’t want to hear what you’re watching on your phone and neither does anyone else in here. TURN IT DOWN!
584 2018-02-26 22:45:51 You can blame our lack of railroad infrastructure on the automobile and oil lobbies in addition to the population choosing cars over trains. Amtrak couldn't survive without government subsidies. Cars and oil certainly could.
585 2018-02-26 22:45:48 I'm eccentric. Listening to Vera Lynn, and loving the odour of shellfish oil..eccentric, right?
I also have a thing for Garlic.

607 2018-02-26 22:43:25 @jjhorgan @AJWVictoriaBC Doesn't it seem odd that both BC refineries go off line at the same time this week? Now BC must rely on getting gas from WA State which has actually refined the bitumen from AB.  So much for Canadian oil companies looking after Canadians first!  #bcpoli

609 2018-02-26 22:43:00 An awkward moment that I experience on a regular basis: every time I get my oil changed and the guy shows me the dip stick. They’re always weird about it.
610 2018-02-26 22:42:41 In a few hrs someone remind me to grab the baby oil and get my Photo shoot on.... I’m bout to break the damn internet..
611 2018-02-26 22:42:37 Precisely. A kid with low self esteem, probably bullied on a regular basis, is eventually pushed to the brink. That right there might be a very motivated individual. They also know the terrain well.

706 2018-02-26 22:30:58 Oil and gas have enough resources to defend themselves. No need to waste his emotional capital needed in states like WV, OH and PA.
707 2018-02-26 22:30:42 Right. Now follow the money. The only reason we went to war with Iraq was because Hussein threatened to trade oil in euros instead of the petrodollar. Causing huge economic turmoil for the US.
708 2018-02-26 22:30:37 Jason, in over 8 years in power, your PC Government did absolutely nothing for the oil industry.

711 2018-02-26 22:30:23 Do not think that love, in order to be genuine, has to be extraordinary. . . . How does a lamp burn? Through the continuous input of small drops of oil. . . . What are these drops of oil in our lamps? They are the small things of daily life - Mother Theresa
712 2018-02-26 22:30:22 RT @LivingSafely: Pop-Secret #Homestyle this February? Its top two ingredients are #popcorn and partially hydrogenated soybean oil.
713 2018-02-26 22:30:11 Start every morning with a glass of water with fresh-squeezed lemon or lemon oil! (Just make sure it’s an edible, 100% natural-grade oil and not anything synthetic if you go the essential oil route.)
714 2018-02-26 22:30:03 I would like to use that oil in my back.
715 2018-02-26 22:29:59 "So you're going to slice up some avocado, and then some grapefruit, and then drizzle some olive oil on it. That's all I have to say about that."
716 2018-02-26 22:29:57 Has anyone used SlickEnergy to get their oil before? Just curious for some feedback. Thanks
717 2018-02-26 22:29:24 @MorganStanley renowned for their complete rubbish unsubstantiated non-factual write ups about the ever increasing demand on Li.
I would never go by @MorganStanley analysis They r inaccurate with their analysis. They were also wrong about the Oil&Gas analysis years ago!!
718 2018-02-26 22:29:19 PDP squandered $500 billion oil earnings in 16 years - @MBuhari  .........and we need to know this now because.....? Folks I swear if we keep quiet they won't know what to do with themselves they must always say something back it's all they know so sshhh lets be vewy vewy qwayet
719 2018-02-26 22:29:18 I dream of a day where I don't have to think about buying extra virgin olive oil.  One day, I'll just PICK. IT. UP. put it in my basket and never look back.
720 2018-02-26 22:29:02 Welp. I stand solidly by my clary sage suggestion. Peppermint oil is great to add to conditioner along with coconut oil and olive oil

722 2018-02-26 22:28:50 Aparently, there's legitimate reason to hope he comes right back on July 1, but I feel like the general lack of return for some pretty key players over the last few yrs is starting to get on Oil Country's last nerve.
723 2018-02-26 22:28:41 Why do men at the quicky oil change spots always try to shame me? I know what the sticker said. It's has said the same number for 6 months. Just change the oil.
724 2018-02-26 22:28:33 @nielsonTSN1260 question now is...does Hall poison Big Rigs mind with oil hatred enough that he doesn’t return #jiltedlover
725 2018-02-26 22:28:25 How will it work (OIL) ?!!
726 2018-02-26 22:28:19 *brings out bible, holy water, oil of solution, crucifix and cele cane*

You were saying??? 
727 2018-02-26 22:28:17 Healthy Tip:  Eliminate migraines by avoiding triggers. Check the foods u eat. Apply peppermint oil.
728 2018-02-26 22:28:14 You’re probably right. 99% of our foreign policy is about securing natural resources of another country. Mainly being oil

732 2018-02-26 22:27:38 Make sure to tell @realDonaldTrump and @USDA @SecretarySonny: We’re counting on you to protect the #RFS and homegrown energy from attacks by @SenTedCruz and BIG OIL.
733 2018-02-26 22:27:38 Perhaps you can post a link to the list from Alex Salmon,  as top of it would be Scotland as an oil producer.  How long does that last and with the crash in oil price would we not now be wanting a bail out from Westminter or the EU and back into the union.  Think about risks!
734 2018-02-26 22:27:33 how do ppl eat oil and vinegar on sandwiches wtf
735 2018-02-26 22:27:31 I support the Convention Of States supported by the Heritage Foundation that you mentioned. We want term limits for Congress and a Balanced Budget Amendment. The National Debt is a joke because the US has gov. assets worth much more including 3 trillion barrels of shale oil.
736 2018-02-26 22:27:25 I really wanna take everyone that says “to get clear skin just use coconut oil, drink lots of water, and stay out of drama! ” and throw them off a fucking bridge
737 2018-02-26 22:27:17 He's got friends in Low Places
Where the Money talks

738 2018-02-26 22:27:14 Pretttty sure my car needs an oil change 
739 2018-02-26 22:27:09 Go get a car wash, go get a oil change, run to target
740 2018-02-26 22:27:03 How will it work OIL ?!!!
741 2018-02-26 22:27:01 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.
742 2018-02-26 22:26:48 sorry i'm not much help there because i use coconut oil in the shower for my eyes/face to take all my make up off. but i highly recommend ita little goes a long way, it does the trick and makes my skin so soft!
743 2018-02-26 22:26:40 easy recipe. Cook thin cut chicken breast in oil. Cut up in pan, add a small dab of mustard, a few dashes of salt and a splash of lemonade. Yum
744 2018-02-26 22:26:25 How does pulling Canadian oil out of Canadian soil & getting it to market a bad thing? Whatever device you are currently looking at got into your hands due to oil. Your car, clothes, everything. If people took away everything from you related to oil you would be eating grass lol.
745 2018-02-26 22:26:24 GOOD! If I have to appeal my current federal action to the Supreme Court I have a better chance. I am fighting to use the buds of cannabis in the Holy oil of Christ as is required by my faith. Jesus commanded his disciples  to give it to the sick and so I do. It HEALS.
746 2018-02-26 22:26:24 put so much albas oil on my pillow that tears r streaming down my face ://
747 2018-02-26 22:26:21 Guess whose car has another oil leak??? 
748 2018-02-26 22:26:17 Granted the market isnt as easily accessed as for the oil. Total Net  (unrisked) to #AAOG is 33mmboe. £6.7mcap. $4m cash as of end of Sept. New  management. For context RBD's colter well targetting a net unrisked  5.25mmboe.
749 2018-02-26 22:26:16 Yeah, that's what I thought.  Will be interesting to see. CN has massive econ strategic reasons to decrease reliance on oil. The issue will be ability to adopt EV tech, and compliance to efficiency measures, on light vehicles. A lot of the tech gets "adapted", after the fact.
750 2018-02-26 22:25:30 thanks! I will do that then. Social niceties oil the wheels, I still hope...
751 2018-02-26 22:25:14 What a sad day for the people of Kansas! You have your arm around a greedy, science denying, big oil/coal/gas/chem purchased little planet polluting VILLAIN. Guess you don't care about the environment in your state #Kansas
752 2018-02-26 22:25:08 Beauty Tip - Rub olive oil around your nails before embarking on a nail-art design. It makes removing excess polish easier. #oakland #beauty #tip
753 2018-02-26 22:25:01 You have no idea. Alberta is the most conservative Canadian province. Their govt is trying to build an oil pipeline thru neighbouring province of British Columbia; BC said no. In response, 80% of Albertans said feds had ultimate authority to approve pipelines in recent poll.
754 2018-02-26 22:24:51 Has anyone used stimulant free pre workout before? Worth money at all or is it Snake oil? 

Looking to cycle off my cocaine style pre workout dependency.
755 2018-02-26 22:24:39 I burned myself with oil and this hurts so much
756 2018-02-26 22:24:10 yes I started trying to reduce my intake too but it’s in almost everything  I read sometimes they even change its name so it makes it even harder to know! and I read that there is compagnies (like Starbucks) who use “sustainable” palm oil, but idk if it really changes anything?
757 2018-02-26 22:24:04 But it is! I used coconut oil instead of suet. Isn't as thick and sticky, but still good.
758 2018-02-26 22:24:03 I toasted some garlic in olive oil, drizzled it over my spaghetti, put some parsley flakes & parmesan and I'm having an Experience
759 2018-02-26 22:23:46 Oh.. well beard oil maybe? And there are boxers with the sack for your sack
760 2018-02-26 22:23:24 Hi! Our lamb sandwich comes with harissa-spiked yogurt, not tzatziki. If you requested that your sandwich be made with olive oil dressing only, then the yogurt is omitted. We hope that helps!

762 2018-02-26 22:23:22 Doesn't need a highly trained terrorist. Any sufficiently motivated individual with detailed knowledge of locality will find a way in.
763 2018-02-26 22:23:00 Spiders hate peppermint oil. Put some in a squirt bottle + water and spray your garage and all door frames.
764 2018-02-26 22:22:50 Still many will die. There is no room for compromise when it comes to human life, especially our children. We do not have a constitutional right to own and drive a vehicle so we can certainly outlaw them.  Eco/green benefits will be a +, and we can break the bonds of big oil. Win
765 2018-02-26 22:22:46 I’ve got some “little tommy squeaker” oil but it’s for a bugle and anyway I’m in the bath so nick off....did that tweet remind you of the film “free Wiley” the friendly grime killer whale Bob?
766 2018-02-26 22:22:12 Also cows, corn, oil pumps and windmills but mostly what you said.
767 2018-02-26 22:22:03 3 nights in a row have had the best sleep just by adding a few drops of lavender oil on pillow 
768 2018-02-26 22:21:57 Trump sells snake oil FYI
769 2018-02-26 22:21:50 How about the corporate welfare involved in oil subsidies or the gigantic corporate welfare involved with the GOP tax scam?
770 2018-02-26 22:21:49 Expressive Colour. Used water soluble oil paints for this one in canvas paper.
771 2018-02-26 22:21:46 With oil and a cotton bud like any normal person.
772 2018-02-26 22:21:34 Plastic garbage is made from oil. Clean up the ocean and stay away from the SC coast.
773 2018-02-26 22:21:33 Said the oil VP that would poison as much ground water as possible, if it makes him more money. Who cares about clean water, and air, and such. MONEY MONEY MONEY? Right?
774 2018-02-26 22:21:32 100/10 would recommend putting coconut oil in your hair
775 2018-02-26 22:21:29 Try using tea tree oil
776 2018-02-26 22:21:18 Oil change killed my pockets but i needed it
777 2018-02-26 22:21:11 I’ll save your viewers time: the government wants take more of your money away and redistribute it. This is socialism at work. Plus, oil and gas companies want massive profits. This is capitalism at work. The middle class can’t afford these hikes. #killingtheeconomy
778 2018-02-26 22:21:00 Trynna slick a can of oil, who you think you fooling
779 2018-02-26 22:20:47 I like it a lot but talcum is easier to get into and easier to handle around the flat. Nothing worse than having to clean up oil everywhere
780 2018-02-26 22:20:42 Dear Atlantic Council, what the hell have you been smoking! For many years, millions of people died, got displaced and so on, because the worlds leading bully keeps pointing his f#cking finger at their country’s oil and gas supply’s! And you are a beneficiary of that! #complicit
781 2018-02-26 22:20:27 Part of that is the Blanche Lincoln types that claimed to be moderate, & then voted for the party-line for things like Obamacare. In other words, they're known for selling snake oil. Just look at 'moderate', 'pro-life' PA Sen. Bob Casey. He had a 100% rating from NARAL in 2016.
782 2018-02-26 22:20:20 How have I managed to get sun dried tomato oil INSIDE my phone screen and smash it within the space of 4 days? Hands are made of butter ffs

785 2018-02-26 22:19:54 My personal favorite paints are acrylics.  Oil paint's not that much of a step up, it's a lot pricier and doesn't take to paper like acrylics can.  Just remember acrylics aren't finger paints.  ;p

803 2018-02-26 22:18:10 2016 WTI average price $43 dollars. Easy maths now. Production gone up 50% in 6 months. Oil price up 50% from 2016 av.  They own more of the asset. Don’t see how 2016 figures have any relevance.
804 2018-02-26 22:18:09 Early mismgmt no doubt. Yet to see real positive results from chia yet. Headscratcher year for the oil.
805 2018-02-26 22:17:48 Enterprise? Right. Rented a car from them, engine light came on saying oil change was due.
Enterprise told me to take the car to a shop and get an oil change for it !!!  I am not making this up. 
#realstory #fail #Enterprise @TheFive
806 2018-02-26 22:17:47 Black - coal/oil is in their blood
807 2018-02-26 22:17:38 True. Yet for a crypto asset that tracks oil 0.5% would be huge.  

The taxman will eventually find out anyway unless trading on decentralized exchanges or p2p.

842 2018-02-26 22:14:10 you kind of answered it right there. oil. meaning oil fields. honestly even if you go like an hour outside of the city, there's nothing but open farmland and mountains for miles. must be beautiful but still in the middle of nowhere.
843 2018-02-26 22:14:10 why involving religion in this and pouring oil on fire.If terrorists from Muslim countries are not representative of Islamic Teaching.These guys should not be representatives of Jesus teaching.Maybe their racist  agenda,and issues.

846 2018-02-26 22:13:41 It only works with some diesels largely pre CDI/HDI etc & fuel pump specific (mentioned elsewhere in this thread)

The closest petrol equivalent is bio ethanol which is common in south America (I think produced from corn)

848 2018-02-26 22:13:34 Gov Jeff Colyer, Pruitt is a fake! Doesn’t care about the EPA. He does not believe in climate change or scientists. He does like his gas & oil buddies. Watch your back.

853 2018-02-26 22:13:00 If your supporters actually had to pay the full price for every single thing they consumed then we would be having a different story! Let’s end the carbon taxes & the subsidies we hand out to oil companies, let the market dictate prices! I can handle that but can your supporters!

857 2018-02-26 22:12:51 I believe there is a chance of your PEIA being fixed permanently by a severance tax on oil and gas if we have a special session. #wvgov
858 2018-02-26 22:12:48 Yes- God wouldn't have taught us how to refine oil if he hadn't meant for us to pour it into the oceans. God wouldn't have inspired mountain-top-removal mining if he hadn't meant for us to fill the streams. These fatalist repugnant religious zealots. Their v. of god is ridiculous
859 2018-02-26 22:12:41 and edmonton is one of the largest cities in canada its oil land. how is it in the middle of nowhere i dont get it

862 2018-02-26 22:12:07   but that was the only reason why I was interested.  I want a good deal.  Mine cheap coins and keep exchanging until the coins hit the same price as the oil.  I think this is just a way to trade Venezuelan oil just in case they get hit with sanctions. Dont touch for now
863 2018-02-26 22:12:07 Do you  want to learn more about the Oil & Gas industry today  at Radford University College and learn more.

866 2018-02-26 22:11:46 Not at all but it makes trying to fix the problems far more difficult.
867 2018-02-26 22:11:14 Those who don't make A's and don't strike oil — do they feel powerless and unheard? If you don't come from a background of A-making and oil-striking, what changes your mind about being capable of doing those things?

873 2018-02-26 22:10:36 Far from it but am more than ok with giving my opinion and sticking with it. Unlike many who applauded for the removal of certain players and are now calling for the GM's head. Can't have it both ways.

877 2018-02-26 22:10:09 I have friends who worked in the oil industry safety side in NO. The idea that industry practice is predicated on safety or public health is a sick joke.

889 2018-02-26 22:08:31 At this moment African natural resources are stolen by European countries, African countries are all in the hand of European companies. Oil, diamonds, wood, precious metals, etc.
890 2018-02-26 22:08:19 Yes but David Davis doesn’t know what snake oil is, what it’s used for, where to find it, how much it might cost or even if anyone needs it. And if he did know any of that he wouldn’t tell you so 
891 2018-02-26 22:08:06 I'll hedge and try both. Strips and a preserve. I'm thinking mixed with olive oil it's effectively a pesto. Could chuck in a whole lot of basil from garden
892 2018-02-26 22:08:04 Proportionality clause in NAFTA compels us to sell the oil to the Americans.

Seriously, the 'oil to tidewater' argument is pure bunk.

897 2018-02-26 22:07:28 Go on then Sheldon, oil owes me money anyway
898 2018-02-26 22:07:27 Really? 13 years of Blair’s government turned the UK into a bankrupt Orwellian state fighting two illegal oil wars. He abolished free tuition, massively widening the social divide.
899 2018-02-26 22:07:26 One more thing: While the western world is becoming energy dependent from OPEC.  The East is seeking to run a monopoly on middle eastern oil, at the sake of diplomacy: rational thinking, & a righteous thought process?

929 2018-02-26 22:02:07 Yeah that pretty much what I got.  not to keep anything secret,  I read an article that showed sources from the government itself saying it is not backed by oil per se, but that you can exchange your tokens for Venezuelan bolivars which is backed by oil. You cant mine the coin.

961 2018-02-26 21:58:40 I too want a safe & clean environment. But reality is we will still depend on oil for generations to come. Currently our survival, heat, food, transportation, business/commerce & basically everything you own including your home got to you because of oil. We need to do it safely.
962 2018-02-26 21:58:34 Interesting. To be clear, we do you think we need both of? Tax loophole gifts to @liberal_party billionaire cronies of @Bill_Morneau or subsidies to dirty big oil? (hint: our grandkids are unlikely to want or need either, and you were the one who brought up the "long view"...).

985 2018-02-26 21:55:55 Well...there are some home treatments but you still need money to purchase them but this is why we need to change the health system so money doesn't dictate who gets treatment.

990 2018-02-26 21:55:35 12kPa is doable, not sure I'd want my oil filled vacuum pump directly pumping the vapour though
991 2018-02-26 21:55:14 I love getting paid and having to already spend my check on gas and an oil change :))))) just great
992 2018-02-26 21:54:42 wonder where your tax dollars are going?... ask the oil and gas corporations who left us the bill!

997 2018-02-26 21:54:25 Weirdly, most of them have involved getting friendly with a woman I'd meet on a clothing optional beach; the gradual build up of polite conversation leading to covering each other in sun oil and eventually love juice

1011 2018-02-26 21:52:36 Hey @Walmart @walmarthelp when an oil change results in damages that the store says they will fix because it's their fault, the solution should NOT be drop your vehicle off 4 times when they say to and they still don't fix. any advice @ClarkHoward ?

1025 2018-02-26 21:50:44 its not that they have dried out, its that the rubber has degraded. only good way to fix it is to replace the rubber. its not that they have dried and lost anything like water or oil. like those historic space suits that are so brittle and cant be unfolded due to rubber rot. :(

1032 2018-02-26 21:49:32 Truth!!! Especially the poly-unsaturated oils. Those long chain fatty acids are especially unstable and succestable to oxidation/rancidity. If you're going to cook with an oil, coconut oil is your best bet because of its stability.

1047 2018-02-26 21:47:25 Consumers need to take it in their hands. Otherwise oil kings will keep on and on and on...
1048 2018-02-26 21:47:12 There's no oil in Syria so why would America do anything?

1064 2018-02-26 21:45:23 So? Its not as dangerous as the most hazardous jobs like working with farm equipment, or being on an oil rig. It easily makes the top 20 most dangerous jobs. Its actually number 15, meaning its deadly dangerous. And the rest of what you said is just hateful gibberish. Enough said
1065 2018-02-26 21:45:22 So take the food away from them. I am not categorically saying crude oil is why we are in a mess. I am saying Nigerians do not have the discipline to manage convenient wealth. If we laboured more for our revenue we would not be so relaxed about our leaders' impunity. Sad but true

1071 2018-02-26 21:44:34 Past few years have been quite shocking for oil plays. It's quite off putting to me. What we really need to start seeing is these oil plays actually working out again and getting that hype we use to have around the drills
1072 2018-02-26 21:44:30 Best of luck to @patmaroon and @MarkLetestu with your new clubs, will miss you in Oil silks.
1073 2018-02-26 21:44:22 I thought the same thing.... but Trump is already owned by Russia.  Perhaps Trump sold Bibi the embassy move which Putin also demanded.  For 50 years administrations of both parties have worked to maintain neutrality in the Mid East.  Most folks understand why intuitively... OIL

1088 2018-02-26 21:43:09 Fun is working up the courage to go get the car oil changed and being upsold to all the filters, bells, horns, shit imaginable.

1098 2018-02-26 21:41:11 Killing coal is an often stated goal of those alarmed about global warming.

1162 2018-02-26 21:33:56 I'd be interested to know how you modeled that curve. With broadening middle-class, I'd be very surprised that even from an organic perspective oil consumption could peak anywhere near late 20's. This would require exponential efficiency adaptation, in 10 years.

1240 2018-02-26 21:24:31 That's true, austerity measures are good. But we would still stagnate without mega projects (like Tanzania). Unless we expedite oil production which we discovered ten years ago and still no drop used or sold. What we shouldn't do is borrow and use money for recurrent expenditure.

1286 2018-02-26 21:18:41 you're not making jobs, you are dumping a huge debt onto the people of Alberta. They only ones profiting are the oil companies. Reminds me of George Bush. Is all about the oil
1287 2018-02-26 21:18:34 An oil change @jiffylube is never done in a jiff. #avoid

1292 2018-02-26 21:17:49 Drybrush them Blue Horror (my etherium blue had dried up) and used thinned nun oil to add some contrast between the armour and bone. And finally sprayed them blue glaze again frombelow 2/2

1296 2018-02-26 21:17:27 ANTI-FRACKING 
We are beyond fracked!
What is it?
Fracking is the process of using high pressured water and chemicals to extract oil and gas from rocks.
1297 2018-02-26 21:17:21 "Behold, how good and pleasant it is when brothers dwell in unity! It is like the precious oil on the head...It is like the dew of Hermon, which falls on the mountains of Zion! For there the Lord has commanded the blessing, life forevermore."

1299 2018-02-26 21:17:14 So apparently all this time I been riding around with my break light out and didn't know it. And of course the dealership taxing with the price  $40 for a damn break light plus $60 for a oil change . I'm sure a bus pass is way cheaper  but I hate people

1307 2018-02-26 21:16:13 Check our antecedece, corruption became main stay from the point when crude oil revenues exceeded tax, sometime in the 70s. From that moment on govt became nonchalant with other sources of income & their responsibility towards developing social infrastructure

Their relation is ambiguous from time to time. No set ratio is in between. If you use #USD to gauge #WTI prices, the chances are you might be in the losing trades.

1312 2018-02-26 21:15:37 Spoken like a true republican. You’re no oil painting yourself my friend.
1313 2018-02-26 21:15:33 Complaint: Winter check @halfords really messed me around and nearly cost me thousands! My oil was dangerously low only a bit more than a month after the check. I would advise that you don't use @halfords for Winter Checks and rather ask someone you trust to do a good job.

5While the bridegroom lingered and was slow in coming, they all began nodding their heads, and they fell asleep

6But at midnight there was a shout, Behold, the bridegroom! Go out to meet him!
1347 2018-02-26 21:11:58 To add to that, Maroon likely looking for a bigger deal than the Oil want to give, so retaining him costs you the return you got.
1348 2018-02-26 21:11:56 I know it might be hard but look at license plates on oil gas trucks, from other states.U could have cut corporate tax base t 25% and did something great to middleclass but as we see,rich and big companies more important. These companies don't pay near that anyway u know this.

1351 2018-02-26 21:11:33 Sen Sullivan #BudgetAustetity - misses point on oil policy. W SB 21 oil bill he cheered today, ANWR fields will pay $0 in Production taxes for 1st 7 yrs of production. W modest 25% tax on oil profits as House Coalition passed we’d receive $700 more @ today’s prices #akleg ....

Once again, I point you to his record of failure and incompetence in achieving results. That is the polar opposite definition of "effective".

Harper moved a lot of wind, but ultimately achieved nothing.

1381 2018-02-26 21:08:12 Interesting. So you don’t think the Norwegian economy and diversified industry was “saved” last minute by the oil price crash and exchange loss, that we are generally overspending, and that its a risk the bubble blows again?
1382 2018-02-26 21:08:07 It's a good question. Need to find a good vegan version of fish oil. It's been the one thing my body craves.
1383 2018-02-26 21:07:56 I could probably buy an entirely brand new car and have it shipped from the manufacturer before they finish changing my oil 
1384 2018-02-26 21:07:54 Come on now, I do know the American dollar is worth more in Canada. Which is why America buys so many Canadian products, lumber & oil. I don’t know all the details. But it’s good for Americans too. Without Canadian lumber your houses would be more expensive.

1412 2018-02-26 21:02:58 Sure. As long as your opinions line up with big corporations like oil, pharmaceuticals and gun manufacturers 
1413 2018-02-26 21:02:57 We as a civilization will depend on oil for generations to come. The infrastructure is currently not in place to move away from it. That’s reality. Our survival, heat, food, transportation, business/commerce etc depends on oil. Including the plastic in the shoes protesters wear.

1422 2018-02-26 21:02:04 All I'll say is if Chiarelli was offered a 2nd at any point this season for Maroon and decided not take it, shame on you sir. That was always the ceiling. #Oilers
1423 2018-02-26 21:01:58 @sidney_alexis it would still b in a mess cos its not d oil that's d problem but its geographical location. So the owners will
1424 2018-02-26 21:01:55 so I’m at the auto place/gas station waiting for my oil change and the cheetah girls start playing, needless to say they’ve got all my business now 
1425 2018-02-26 21:01:54 @FrenchGuyCookin hi Alex, big fan of your cooking and videos! Tried doing black garlic oil today using 3 cloves of garlic and extra virgin olive oil. Stopped when garlic became almost black. Oil tastes really bitter. Is that how it should be? There's hardly any garlic taste 
1426 2018-02-26 21:01:32 The guy is inspecting my tires plz just change my oil and I’ll look into my tires another day thnx
1427 2018-02-26 21:01:19 Hahaha! Every damn time.
1428 2018-02-26 21:01:17 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.

1449 2018-02-26 20:59:53 Oh god and the creaky door as you try to shut it - I had to keep brushing my daughter's door hinges with olive oil! #mumshour
1450 2018-02-26 20:59:52 Pretty sure they just mean like frying foods in oil so it's heated at a high temp.
1451 2018-02-26 20:59:11 So oilers have gone from drafting just oil kings to just scouting Boston College. Progress.
1452 2018-02-26 20:59:03 U didn't think it was as a result of NigerDeltans laying claims as exclusive owners CrudeOil? Thinking there is no other way Nigeria can earn money apart from crude oil? At a point they almost destroyed all oil installations? If Ure the President u will still be thinking of oil?
1453 2018-02-26 20:59:01 So I put coconut oil in my peppermint ginger tea today. . .
1454 2018-02-26 20:58:58 Just when I think the snake oil couldn't get any more toxic. . .
1455 2018-02-26 20:58:47 Data is the new oil.
1456 2018-02-26 20:58:39 The same way other small countries do. Small countries that do not have the same natural resources that Scotland has. You do know that oil only makes up a small % of the Scottish economy. Now are you going to answer my question or is it the case you can't?
1457 2018-02-26 20:58:19 @TenderGreens Our NEW Fryer Fuel Advantage is the most advanced frying oil in the market place today with 2X the frying time! It would be great for your restaurants!
1458 2018-02-26 20:58:17 I wake up every morning and rub castor oil on edges and leave out 
1459 2018-02-26 20:58:17 Flexing muscle or standing up against false accusations. The slaughter of Yemeni civilians by the gulf state oil despots constitutes human rights violations of not outright genocide. It is blockaded for years, how exactly is Iran delivering missiles?
1460 2018-02-26 20:58:13 It's Monday. I done ate my vitamins, took some fish oil, drinking my water & suddenly I feel like this is #GodsPlan
1461 2018-02-26 20:58:12 Crumbs from master’s table Mr Mogg? Supporter of elites, big tobacco, big oil, anyone/thing with money, at the expense of everyone else. (With the occasional vanity charity project)
1462 2018-02-26 20:58:08 The kind of concerns that "Millenials" grabble with ie that (the USA is a war monger) I can relate to. But in what reality does letting 10,000 pedophiles loose on the street seem coherent? Or crap scrapers, and tent cities? It simply makes no sense to me, it's like oil and water!
1463 2018-02-26 20:58:04 I havent seen so much talent wasted on team like the oil do in last decade. If i was the owner i would be furious with these transactions... But wait he doesnt care about his team or city or fans. Just a glimpse of hope last year to warrant another 10 year bust
1464 2018-02-26 20:57:57 .@VCFD is responding to a reported oil seep fire on Koenigstein Road in Upper Ojai. @CHP_Ventura has closed one lane of Koenigstein Road as of 12:36 p.m. Avoid the area if possible.
1465 2018-02-26 20:57:46 If she don’t smell like shea butter and coconut oil I don’t want her
1466 2018-02-26 20:57:46 I needed the one trophy that needs you to set 30 enemies on fire by shooting oil barrels. Well, I was quite done with it, so I stood next to one, let some enemies come close, shot the barrel and caught fire and died.. Turns out that was also the last enemy I needed to kill...

1469 2018-02-26 20:57:38 My car a beast when the oil is changed, tire pressure on point, and the tires rotated!
Never again will I go that long without servicing!!
1470 2018-02-26 20:57:15 Getting a Oil change on my car finally 
1471 2018-02-26 20:57:13 When I forget to refill the humidifier, my face reminds me by cracking at the edges and producing gobs of oil for that Subtropical Skin In New England Winter feel.
1472 2018-02-26 20:57:10 Pesto was the 80s. Is it bacK? quiche was the 70s. Real Men Don't Eat Quiche. Then came balsamic vinegar. Then drizzled. Molten chocolate cakes. Truffle oil. And now we're eating crow

1476 2018-02-26 20:56:43 Did you guys know that George Clooney rented a fucking satellite once to take pictures of a town that was being taken over by this big oil company to freeze its assets and destroy the business??
1477 2018-02-26 20:56:36 Her own side attacking her. Interesting.
Still a Dem at heart.
1478 2018-02-26 20:56:34 I would think so. If anything the oil should be getting more picks to package and send Lucic to a team willing to eat that contract. He is just god awful
1479 2018-02-26 20:56:20 It would be a lot to remember :)

1487 2018-02-26 20:55:22 Can see why you think that! I actually can’t wait for the day when I can be fitting a real alternative to gas and oil. I do work out of a leaf! Need to develop a dom heat pump that will work at 70 deg, and still be 400% eff. Then can compete with gas financially.
1488 2018-02-26 20:55:21 The US doesn’t need Canadian oil anymore. Your beliefs are stuck in 2007. A lot has happened this last decade.
1489 2018-02-26 20:55:01 LOL.... I just dunno, we got what we got for an older player without a long history in the league. Love the guy, but he's not elite. Plus, we can sign him if the Oil want to in July
1490 2018-02-26 20:54:59 thank you but my birthday has gone. i bet you would like my roast potatoes!
Crispy and fluffy in the middle. night chicken xx
1491 2018-02-26 20:54:50 My bad B , I use leave in conditioners but I hear oils usually work way better. I always hear Palm or Virgin Olive Oil but I would ask around first.
1492 2018-02-26 20:54:39 Ha! No need to read polls! The country is slowly waking up, realizing they fell for a snake oil salesman, TV Showman who put a catchy patriotic sounding slogan on a red hat made in China, who's just trying to enrich himself and rich friends. Fool them once, shame on them... :)
1493 2018-02-26 20:54:34 It’s just the oil it’s like a lil vape pen shit mad litty
1494 2018-02-26 20:54:34 I would have been upset if they got an AHLer that could be injected into the line up now. But it will be years before anything in this deal is useful to the oil. That's if they even make it to the NHL. Chi waited to long in the hopes he would get anything. Should have kept Pat.
1495 2018-02-26 20:54:32 @WhereChefsShopOur Our NEW Fryer Fuel Advantage is the most advanced frying oil in the market place today with 2X the frying time! It would be great for your chefs!
1496 2018-02-26 20:54:30 My guess is Chiarelli/Scouts wanted a current or ex-Edmonton Oil King. Instead settled for a Oil King like player who plays of a team with other Oilers prospects. Very Oiler-like from their scouts to do this.
1497 2018-02-26 20:54:27 Thank you Sen. Markey for fighting for all Fishermen, for the Environmental Habitats. Most of all, fighting for our rights as Citizens of the USA. The Ocean Belongs to all of us, not just a few Oil & Gas companies.
1498 2018-02-26 20:54:22 Ah the other Corbyn that has made themselves substantially rich by peddling snake oil to idiots
1499 2018-02-26 20:54:20 You really don’t need sunflower serum when there’s e oil
1500 2018-02-26 20:53:46 Texas is like the oil capitol of everything fam.
1501 2018-02-26 20:53:35 When Pentecostals attack Catholics, I laugh cos so many of our practices, rituals and rite aren't biblical too. Many are actually against God's word. One of such practices is the 'first fruit offering'. Lemme add d use of blackcurrant drinks, anointing oil and so much more.
1502 2018-02-26 20:53:21 Heating the house like a boss tonight, oil filled rad blasting out 1KW heat to supplement the radiators - thermostat nudging 17c - sweltering. #coldweather
1503 2018-02-26 20:53:14 They look more like oil non-workers to me.
1504 2018-02-26 20:53:07 If that's the reason for oil, I'm afraid I'll be serving extra time...
1505 2018-02-26 20:53:03 I would have agreed to your tweet but oil when touch yam go reach under the plate sadly
1506 2018-02-26 20:52:56 Changing your trucks oil #yourself is more than just good #Maintenance, it’s a time to #reflect and #appreciate the things you have. Takes less than an hour but your under it taking good care of what’s yours, you pay for this and it’s yours #OwnIt it’s #humbling
1507 2018-02-26 20:52:49 I still stick by my Sunday tweet, looking for SPX OIL GOLD down & NG up.  We're close, I can smell it. ;-)
1508 2018-02-26 20:52:49 Oh nah girl I’m not mad I’m just saying if that’s how u do it then do you cause it is the recommended shit but my cars have been fine when I change the oil wayyyyy past 3,000 miles so it’s always been excessive for me
1509 2018-02-26 20:52:42 The only thing is I wouldn't want our great United players missing up to play with those scousers or Citeh oil money players.
1510 2018-02-26 20:52:41 If they got a gallon of vegetable oil for Chimera that would have been a good move
1511 2018-02-26 20:52:33 Hmmmm sure. You do realize the USA is set to be a huge net oil exporter. The deal is we need them way more than they need us and how will Canada be in NA when the USA and Mexico enter a free trade agreement.

1514 2018-02-26 20:51:34 I knew Oil fans were setting themselves up for disappointment. Flames fans too for that matter, for different reasons. Very underwhelming times in 'Berta.
1515 2018-02-26 20:51:33 This snake oil stuff. Have you found any new trade deals for it? Your government is swimming in it
1516 2018-02-26 20:51:27 Just remembered why I HATE coming to Honda to get my oil changed. It’s a brand new car It shouldn’t take an hour and a half.
1517 2018-02-26 20:51:20 I put tea tree oil in my hair mask and now my neck is burning
1518 2018-02-26 20:51:07 I mix cocoa butter and bio oil. A blessing 
1519 2018-02-26 20:51:07 A better solution is. Government must Divest from gun makers,banksters & oil war profiteers. Arrest lobbyist bribe makers and politician bribetakers who sell death to all sides attempting cause civilwar & world war. Demilitarize. Remove zionazicon kkk u.s. cops, ice, gestapo, ss.
1520 2018-02-26 20:51:05 We need all Texans to call, tweet, email @tedcruz that TX ag needs the RFS.  Do it  now! Cruz is more concerned about an oil refinery in Penn than TX ag.
1521 2018-02-26 20:51:03 99% of American workplaces are machines set on grinding their employees into bloody, pulpy oil, used to grease a mechanism which crushes all the money-juice out of anyone not already ground up in the machine.
1522 2018-02-26 20:51:02 SELL $SDRL -based on fundamentals of new Ch11 plan filed, shares will crash any day now just like OceanRig, Tidewater and PacificDrilling. 95% downside $OIL

1525 2018-02-26 20:50:49 I've been in the oilpatch my whole life and watched this very closely. Harper was by far the most effective PM to advocate for our #Oil & #gas.
Trudeau wants you to buy into this #ClimateChange brainwashing crap
FACT CHECK-The DEMAND for #Oil & #gas is increasing! Like it or not!
1526 2018-02-26 20:50:43  YALL SOMEBODY COME GET EHRIN!!!! my girl tryna throw on some baby oil in this 100 degree weather 
1527 2018-02-26 20:50:35 As if the MU gym wasn’t already enough of a disappointment, I just went to jog on a treadmill (very out of character for me but whatever) and not only was it covered in a sheet of oil (?) but some guy ran over to warn me that occasionally, it “gives off electric shocks”. Ideal.
1528 2018-02-26 20:50:34 So fuel prices have been level for a few years, they are half what they were 6 years ago . There is A oil glut but we are to believe this fucking propaganda?!
1529 2018-02-26 20:50:32 All for oil...smh

1531 2018-02-26 20:50:27 just found out that cooking with coconut oil is just cooking with the saturated fat that you've been avoiding, so congratulations, you have literally done nothing different from eating a bag of doritos.
1532 2018-02-26 20:50:24 Bottles of rubbing alcohol/hydrogen peroxide and boxes of alcohol wipes for stain removal/cleaning laptops & cell phones. Bags of Epsom salts (add essential oil to make DIY bath soak!) Denture tablets for whitening your nails and cleaning retainers.
1533 2018-02-26 20:50:24 It's okay, it's not forever and then you are reincarnated. You only get boiled in oil for eating meat. If your vegetarian, you're all good.
1534 2018-02-26 20:50:08 @chefjohnbesh Have you heard about our NEW Fryer Fuel Advantage?! It's the most advanced frying oil in the market place today! Lets talk!
1535 2018-02-26 20:50:01 Shit I'd name some Coconut Oil and Okra Gel lube.... Bustanut Lube...
1536 2018-02-26 20:49:59 as long as you don't have alergies any nut oil will do. Tung or Danish are fine but need 5 days to fully cure.
1537 2018-02-26 20:49:53 Cars are expensive and oil changes are 20 dollars. Idk why you're angry damn I wasn't being mean.
1538 2018-02-26 20:49:47 Any solid oil with a low melting point will do. I'm especially fond of coconut oil. (It's not just for smearing on your titties, you know.)

I should have added a little trademark symbol after 'Crisco Twister' but I can't find it on my computer.
1539 2018-02-26 20:49:40 Have any of my followers tried CBD oil? I have some questions 
1540 2018-02-26 20:49:29 The fact that you are using an electronic device to tweet this makes you just as culpable as big oil.  Thanks Jonathan Overpeck......
1541 2018-02-26 20:49:25 ... Cathy, foreign oil costs less. Why should we pay more for American produced oil. Americans already help subsidize the U.S. Oil Industry with lower taxation. Look at the state of Oklahoma. They cut Education and HHS funding to give the Oil Industry tax breaks. ...
1542 2018-02-26 20:49:24 Real live news!!! With the constant stream of fake news this is great. Thks
1543 2018-02-26 20:49:23 I didn't know that we would be boiled in oil, if Hindus are correct. Thanks for letting me know.
1544 2018-02-26 20:49:21 They sound just like my liberal neice,
1545 2018-02-26 20:49:20 WHY INDY ROADS SO BAD YOU ASK???  well....

"Lucas Oil Stadium, a $719 million downtown arena, cost the Colts, a franchise worth $1 billion at the time, only $100 million when it opened in 2008. The $619 million in public funding is still the largest sum in NFL history."
1546 2018-02-26 20:49:17 I ordered that today Fiona so that's great. I put Magnolia youth serum oil on today for first time and WOW !! Should I use anything else when applying that our put it in alone ? Thank you Fiona x

1548 2018-02-26 20:48:58 Alright live ur life keep ur healthy ass oil
1549 2018-02-26 20:48:57 When your man changed your oil and puts new tires on your car on his day off. #spoiled #loved #appreciatehim
1550 2018-02-26 20:48:49 Idk how I functioned without CBD oil #lifesaver
1551 2018-02-26 20:48:43 No in town, oil is cheaper and gas is not so widely used here where I am. 
1552 2018-02-26 20:48:39 Thanks for everything you done in Oil Country @patmaroon!!! All the best in New Jersey!! #BigRig
1553 2018-02-26 20:48:35 Hell yeah that’s that synthetic oil I swear they just taxed my ass
1554 2018-02-26 20:48:33 Cuticle oil will literally take ya nails from looking crusty asf to looking brand new 
1555 2018-02-26 20:48:33 Looking on the bright side, perhaps the 2019 picks are a blessing in disguise...can't see any way Chiarelli makes it through this season and another. #Oilers
1556 2018-02-26 20:48:31 I just bought it & she is dirty plus I want to oil? her. So what do I clean with & what is the best oil to use. I have been researching. But I am not using BLEACH on this beauty! Yes the recommendation is bleach! Thank you Ben for responding. There is still a hint of cedar.

1558 2018-02-26 20:48:23 Nailed it
1559 2018-02-26 20:48:20 What kind of oil? Because my kid has a peanut allergy, and it would be a shame if he couldn't visit me in the afterlife...
1560 2018-02-26 20:48:10 Damn it’s raining all week. I won’t even be able do an oil change
1561 2018-02-26 20:48:07 Unfortunately, nothing. Paleo fad kale chips are a) nothing like crisps and b) still require oil in their cooking.
1562 2018-02-26 20:48:04 I love chugging from this big vodka bottle all day 
( lol jk I put water in it )since my uncle wanna drink me n put oil in the gin bottle 2 can play that game
1563 2018-02-26 20:47:57 If other people are in place then draft and development might improve.  And trade return.  And performance. And the decision making.  (ESL training for Pulparty)
1564 2018-02-26 20:47:55 Boston college is Chiarelli’s version of the Oil Kings
1565 2018-02-26 20:47:50 Also I change my own oil every three months but when I went to NTB they would check everything and fill up my airs with air for free. I think the reminder is kind of nice too. Not that deep.
1566 2018-02-26 20:47:49 we will need more chargers soon as well. Oil is outdated and old energy. If you drive an electric car you will never want gas again.
1567 2018-02-26 20:47:46 [9:47PM] @TransOceana: Movement to WORLD OIL FILLING STATION after CHISCO Bus-stop is ok @Gidi_Traffic #GIDITRAFFIC
1568 2018-02-26 20:47:36 Oil goes up and down so sometimes you might buy it when you don't need it just because it's gone cheap 
1569 2018-02-26 20:47:25 oil can jeff
1570 2018-02-26 20:47:22 when #callthemidwife casually drops a reference to foreign oil companies fueling civil conflicts in Nigeria in the 60s in addition to their regular discussion of state healthcare, women's rights etc. Trying to imagine a French drama addressing Elf in Gabon #lowkeyradicalism
1571 2018-02-26 20:47:18 I see a lot of Black owned soap and cosmetic companies. But wheres the Black owned lube company? Shit I want to use some Coconut oil & Okra gel lube. Recognize your potential people....
1572 2018-02-26 20:47:18 You’re right.  He doesn’t talk about the existence Dinosaurs or trans-genderism or if dumping oil into the ocean is okay either.

How does one know what to believe about these issues?

1575 2018-02-26 20:46:55 I honestly just can't wrap my head around the immoral and hypocritical life you must lead. How do you stand it? oh yeah 3.8 MILLION IN NRussiA MONEY ALONE WOULD MAKE IT EASIER PLUS THE MILLIONS YOU GET FROM BIG OIL. YOU'RE GONE IN 2020 IF YOU AREN'T INDICTED BEFORE #GunControlNow
1576 2018-02-26 20:46:46 Castor oil and coconut oil helped me. Try those
1577 2018-02-26 20:46:31 He has classical schooling and FSB/KGB experience. Additionally his CPU runs much faster than the average Head of State’s does and he is able to fund different skirmishes with oil. Keeping everyone busy domestically, eases Putins path globally. #divideandconquer #motherrussia
1578 2018-02-26 20:46:31 While I applaud @realDonaldTrump for his open-minded approach to the gun debate, it further shows that he is purely an opportunist who holds no principled beliefs. This is the guy who promised he would be the strongest gun rights ally imaginable. He's a snake oil salesman.
1579 2018-02-26 20:46:20 lol he say it’s high cause the oil
1580 2018-02-26 20:46:13 Oil change & detailed and boys jackets are ordered  now I can go to work and make my money back 
1581 2018-02-26 20:46:11 Ok even the FA cup, but point being we need to be in the top four without oil money wages. Harsh truth as it stands imo. I’d sooner look forward to a season of European nights over a cup win with players looking to play in the CL.
1582 2018-02-26 20:45:52 Wanting to leather myself up in baby oil lay on the floor and pretend I’m a slug. But I don’t feel like cleaning up the mess afterward. Adulting is hard.
1583 2018-02-26 20:45:50 With some luck, this management group won't be in charge come draft day those picks can be used by whoever takes over.
1584 2018-02-26 20:45:47 اي
1585 2018-02-26 20:45:45 Putting truffle oil on takeaway chips is the ponciest (but greatest) thing I’ve done all week
1586 2018-02-26 20:45:44 The oil fired central heating has been on 24 hours a day 20'C here.
1587 2018-02-26 20:45:42 Go buy your oil and give me a dub I'll change it
1588 2018-02-26 20:45:36 I’ve got the crud too. Try a kettle of boiling water with a little oil in it. Drape kitchen towel over the back of your head and breathe the steam. Ahhhhh! Feel better soon:)
1589 2018-02-26 20:45:32 انقلعي
1590 2018-02-26 20:45:21 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1591 2018-02-26 20:45:20 These oil change places will fuck up your car... trust me.
1592 2018-02-26 20:45:19 wrong @SlopeOfHope , oil is from dead planktoon that died and sank to the bottom of the ocean then was rolled onto land and covered by new dirt
1593 2018-02-26 20:45:02 i thought it was because his oil tycoon great-grandfather was the founder of the baking soda brand but i just googled and this is apparently not the case?!?!?!?!?
1594 2018-02-26 20:44:38 @tedcruz you are a TX Senator not an East Coast Refinery Senator. TX ag needs the RFS and the USA needs oil independence. Stop being an obstacle to AG.
1595 2018-02-26 20:44:23 I agree that Canada should stop digging up and shipping its dirty oil.
1596 2018-02-26 20:44:20 I am sure in some fantasy world the Oilers have a history of packaging picks for useful players but looking at the roster, I don't suggest this management team is any better at doing that than acquiring the picks you desire.
1597 2018-02-26 20:44:18 We should have taken the oil-ISIS would not have been able to form because the oil was their primary source of income.
1598 2018-02-26 20:44:10 Stop playing with hundred of thousands of life , remove Assad , oust Iran, take the oil to pay you and negociate  the peace with Turkey.

1600 2018-02-26 20:43:55 Politicians are the worst.  Usually people who flunked science become politicians.  They become climate deniers because oil and coal companies pay them to front for those companies that refine oil and mine coal.
1601 2018-02-26 20:43:54 Y’all it smells like vegetable oil in my apartment building
1602 2018-02-26 20:43:51 I had to go see my doctor today, now here in Virginia we are looking at 
#Let the Doc.Decide 
CBD & THC a oil. So I popped the Question "What do you think about Cannabis" He was all in for it, "It is better for pain than any thing I can write"
Kinda set me back for a min.
1603 2018-02-26 20:43:47 The story on ecowatch is more believable than this sectarian violence tale
1604 2018-02-26 20:43:47 Which month's topic talked about the topic that you prefer EuroDollar more than 10-year leading crude oil? I'm your subscriber, but I'm struggling in finding that report. Could you please give me a hint to so that I can find that report?
1605 2018-02-26 20:43:33 I danced around it, then got a tumbleweed and soaked it with olive oil. In a few months we'll know if that worked.
1606 2018-02-26 20:43:27 Or not treating  cancer might have done the job
1607 2018-02-26 20:43:23 They are incredible animals, so expressive and intelligent. It is truly criminal that they are loosing so much habitat just to give us cheap....well everything really, it is scary how much stuff has Palm Oil in it 
1608 2018-02-26 20:43:20 I use coconut oil on a towelette to remove eye make up! but I do think it’s not the best thing to do for the rest of your face. 
1609 2018-02-26 20:43:19 Um... You're aware it says Trump REMOVED protections, right? 

Although, a lot of times, scientific study is fine. Scientists behave responsibly and respect the land; but drilling for oil, what Trump and his cronies want, is damaging.

Also, what theory is "fading away"?
1610 2018-02-26 20:43:17 I hope you enjoy your birthday , i bet you could be nice if you tried ;)
1611 2018-02-26 20:43:16 I’m a sucker for whitening tooth paste .. smell good oil lotions.. and natural hair products.. 
1612 2018-02-26 20:43:14 The oil man is on this way!!!! Yay!!! Ultima Oil in Kilmacanogue are AMAZING (there's a weeks waiting list for delivery) Once they delivered to a friend of ours who was running a B&B on Stephens Day. That's customer service.

1615 2018-02-26 20:42:33 On second consideration, N77T legitimate Nigerian oil revenue in 17 yrs is N200B+. That’s N12B+ per yr since 2001. $300M is a mere 2.5% of that annual figure. The ROI is incredible. Corrupt president could arrange $1B per annum for their interests if ambitious. 
1616 2018-02-26 20:42:29 I put argon oil in my hair and it's never been this soft
1617 2018-02-26 20:42:25 Make a new golem. I know my eye to be an oil.
1618 2018-02-26 20:42:18 Jiffy lube be expensive for an oil change
1619 2018-02-26 20:42:16 Don't forget Carter Page, he's the one who sealed the deal for trump to revive 11% stake in Resnof oil{worth $200M} .(Russia oil company) in exchange for less oil drilling sanctions.

1624 2018-02-26 20:41:47 I need someone to rub my scalp with oil

1626 2018-02-26 20:41:11 @stephenfry #huckcancer get on the CBD oil. My mum died of the dreaded C and I wish I’d been able to suggest it to her. It can’t hurt to try. Best of luck.

1629 2018-02-26 20:40:48 While I am unhappy about the Maroon deal and what we got in return, I am happy (so far) that The Nuge is still with the Oil. #NHLTradeDeadline #edmontonoilers
1630 2018-02-26 20:40:32 If they're talking about oil changes it's def recommended every three months.
1631 2018-02-26 20:40:25 Me and my manager just got tipped $40 for changing this ladys oil. Her oil change was only $37.. She tipped more than the price of the oil, like wtf I am shocked, happy an grateful.

&, most importantly Dossier oil deal
1637 2018-02-26 20:39:48 Test scores are more important than real life. Obviously.
1638 2018-02-26 20:39:36 Real looking forward to you having to join Milo selling snake oil supplements on InfoWars when even Republicans can smell what you're saying. 
1639 2018-02-26 20:39:30 Thank you everyone who have preordered my beard oil! We are going into production this week!  Love you guys!
1640 2018-02-26 20:39:23 have half a tin of brass hand oil if that's any good
1641 2018-02-26 20:39:07 I can't wait till the uv index is above 5 so I can dip myself in coconut oil and not look like I'm severely ill anymore
1642 2018-02-26 20:39:07 Seems like this oil is helping!!! I haven't been as sensitive to bending over, squatting, standing for more than an hour. Using 2 drops in AM of 500mg oil & can tell a diff!!! This is exciting for me!!! Was thinking surgery AGAIN!! Now, maybe not!!! YIPPEE!!!!! 
1643 2018-02-26 20:39:01 I literally start fuming with anger whenever the bare minimum recommend me coconut oil for anything
1644 2018-02-26 20:38:57 Just as oil saved our whales.
1645 2018-02-26 20:38:46 It's not about Syria alone.. West Asia as such is in a serious crisis.. be it Yemen,Iraq or Lebanon.. every action has implications for other affected nations..in the end it's all OIL
1646 2018-02-26 20:38:28 I swallowed a spoonful of coconut oil and I’m feeling siiiiicccckkkkk
1647 2018-02-26 20:38:27 Took my road trip. Got my oil changed. Hit up a casino. Won a little cash. Hit up my favorite pizza spot. And got it all done w/an hr to spare before Jeopardy! returns to it's normal time. Yay me!
1648 2018-02-26 20:38:20 We have our own oil.  We sell to you actually
1649 2018-02-26 20:38:13 Is the notion of packaging the picks in deals for actual useful players foreign to you? They're not getting anything other than a marginal prospect in this kind of deal.

He pushed for INTERNATIONAL markets! 
Beat your own drum if it makes you feel better
Trudeau can't push for even 1 & just lost the deal w/INDIA
1654 2018-02-26 20:37:30 If the return for Maroon is a 3rd and a failed prospect (Dudek), Oil did not do well on this deal. Seems Chia has a blind bias for this player; math says he won't pan out.
1655 2018-02-26 20:37:29 This guy at the oil change smells like weed and just called me babygirl 
1656 2018-02-26 20:37:15 @Kezzacarpenter @Kemeys what's the oil going around on Saturday for the darby.

1666 2018-02-26 20:35:33 Looking goof mate.  Last reported average out of PM was 91bpd (May 2017 RNS). Great to see an increase in production coincide with the rise oil WTI
1667 2018-02-26 20:35:24 bruh so youre saying you dont mix in the oil on top of the peanut butter before you eat it?

1671 2018-02-26 20:35:12 I tried balm - didn't like it. I'm an oil man.
1672 2018-02-26 20:35:11 C'mon, what's a bot gotta do to get an oil fix around here?
1673 2018-02-26 20:35:08 Absolutely sick & fed up of hearing MSM blaming Russia for everything, from Syria (Russia hasn’t been funding/arming rebels to regime change for oil/gas pipelines & Golan Heights land & oil) to the weather. Russia is in Europe. We don’t want ME oil interests stoking war in Europe
1674 2018-02-26 20:35:08 See to me smugglers would not steal the oil if they were not going to get paid; now appears smugglers get paid two ways, one from UN Puppets and later from some company? country? from the West - sanctioning the companies US can do/countries, now that would be different
1675 2018-02-26 20:35:03 I have to get more oil in tomorrow, tank nearly empty 
1676 2018-02-26 20:34:53 no I know but I wonder if the powder mixed in would help with the absorption of oil
1677 2018-02-26 20:34:28 People currently Googling “Dudek Oil Kings” are going to crash the internet.
1678 2018-02-26 20:34:16 They don't have any oil so will get no help from other countries.
1679 2018-02-26 20:34:14 dammit I thought it'd be something cool like u drink a bottle of olive oil every day
1680 2018-02-26 20:34:14 Why isn't oil & gas responsible for fixing what oil & gas has done to our marshes?
1681 2018-02-26 20:33:59 Haha nice. I've never smoked the legal oil or Vapes. I'm old school. I've done way more other stuff but not the legal kind of Bud
1682 2018-02-26 20:33:54 Who gives a flying whatever about this deadline.  The Oilers have two star players.  The draft pick in 2018 will be a player in 2023, maybe, and judging by the Oilers track record they are better off getting a prospect from someone else than picking their own.
1683 2018-02-26 20:33:53 Jesus Christ, this kid’s got a take on everything. Sad for him long-term, but delish to watch Libtardia suck every last second out of this fake news coverage. It will not be helpful in November.

1688 2018-02-26 20:32:53 i thought about that, or throwing large boulders down. it seems like the gameplay is so hectic, the player would never have time to go pick up an oil bucket and pour it down. maybe if i slowed down the ladders. i want it to be fun, but not overcomplicated.
1689 2018-02-26 20:32:44 What a joke. That's the best deal of the entire deadline. How the HELL did other teams let this go down? Are any of those players premium prospects???

1697 2018-02-26 20:31:27 @patmaroon Gonna miss you big rig! Go win a cup with @hallsy09 and then re sign with the oil in the off season.

1700 2018-02-26 20:30:29 You ever put off doing something for so long that you forget you have to do it? Yeah I forgot to do an oil change for months lol and now I’m paying the price for being an idiot lol

1702 2018-02-26 20:30:29 OIL DIFF: 3.55 -> 3.6
1703 2018-02-26 20:30:22 Very true. It is shameful that our leaders obsession for oil is so strong that when the world is moving away from fossil fuel, all our leaders can think of is oil money. This explains the current rave to prospect for oil in the Northern part of the country at all cost.
1704 2018-02-26 20:30:14 You smoke i smoke

1714 2018-02-26 20:28:42 Nice. I’m smoking oil right now but I have a joint at home hidden. I can’t wait to go home.
1715 2018-02-26 20:28:26 Can you pour hot oil on them
1716 2018-02-26 20:28:20 It would probably be smart to loosen the somewhat hidden screw that his backpack spins around. The peg it spins on is somewhat hexagonal. It isn't that big of a deal, but it could stress that joint. Shock oil would help too.

1721 2018-02-26 20:27:53 It's the palm oil that caused the problem. 
Crepitations everywhere bilaterally
1722 2018-02-26 20:27:43 if u use natural peanutbutter it's sometimes better to keep in the fridge so the oil doesn't separate as quickly
1723 2018-02-26 20:27:39 If this deadline hasn't given you enough evidence, the picks hold much more value...hence better trade pieces.
1724 2018-02-26 20:27:38 I've noticed considerably more traffic, especially semi-trucks on the roads when I travel these days.
1725 2018-02-26 20:27:26 Russia will take over Syria like they did the Crimean peninsula in the Ukraine. That’s the only reason they are there. Oil, and to be in the Middle East. But they be better be ready to die when we blast their asses.

1741 2018-02-26 20:25:27 Oilers don't need picks.  They need players that can play.  Their ability to draft and develop sucks.  Why do you want that vs. more developed prospects?
1742 2018-02-26 20:25:18 Best thing: make a whipped butter. Cocoa butter, shes butter, coconut oil, vitamin E oil. I use it for everything. Hair growth, skin moisturizer, and to prevent/get rid of razor bumps
1743 2018-02-26 20:25:18 Teriyaki or Garlic olive oil and salt

1763 2018-02-26 20:23:35 I’ve got a theory for you. In order for thc to actually effect you it has to be heated. Therefore, one could sell cbd oil that has active cbd & inactive thc, after heating said cbd oil it would turn dark brown/black & have active thc. I.e. be very calming. How warm did that get?

1769 2018-02-26 20:23:12 As I said, that’s fair enough, maybe you could try just cutting out dairy or palm oil if you need to eat meat, that would definitely be a way to help the environment and animals :)

1773 2018-02-26 20:22:26 Maybe if we hadn’t stirred up a hornets nest in the Middle East with regime change, wars,(protecting oil and poppy fields), destabilizing economy’s we wouldn’t of had a 9/11. God bless all the people involved in a preventable catastrophe. Rights grab .
1774 2018-02-26 20:22:11 made myself the worst smoothie in the world to replace my lunch and i couldn't get it down. avocado, almond butter, coconut milk + oil, and cocoa powder. Sounds good? It's not!

When a minute from done, sprinkle with salt, pepper, chilli flakes and a touch of sugar. Shaken pan back and forth to coat cubes. Serve, eat. (deep fried was a red herring..)

1836 2018-02-26 20:15:34 Bloody good question. At least we'd use the oil money properly.
1837 2018-02-26 20:15:26 @s_ydneyleigh gave me peppermint essential oil and it made my headache go away...i’m in awe

1839 2018-02-26 20:15:14 The thing I love about Yzerman as a GM he recognizes his team needs and does something about it. Interested to see the return.

1841 2018-02-26 20:15:08 Any ideas on where I should drive so I can change my oil tomorrow afternoon, I need another 20 miles?
1842 2018-02-26 20:15:07 Yet citizens cannot afford a 50kg bag, Nigeria among world oil producers yet we have queues at the filling station.
1843 2018-02-26 20:15:04 Not a chance. Going way lower.
Hedge funds are 96% net long oil and 90% net long rbob gasoline.
This is going to unwind as cube fracking hits us over 11 million per day in a few months.

1851 2018-02-26 20:14:12 The world's oil market just isn't willing to pay much for an inferior product. Pipeline or no pipeline. You want Bentley prices for a Kia.
1852 2018-02-26 20:13:57 I started putting Argon oil in my hair and all I can think of when I see my hair "your hair looks sexy pushed back" 
1853 2018-02-26 20:13:33 Yes it does. If you can mix it with peppermint oil too.

1857 2018-02-26 20:13:04 Always wear gloves when handling any chemicals as cleaners are designed to remove oil and grease as well as the natural oils in your skin.
1858 2018-02-26 20:13:00 Dead skin cells of the body can be removed by applying mixture of olive oil and salt. Replacing salt with granulated sugar can work too.
1859 2018-02-26 20:12:30 @ZafarHanan as you always say, Arabs cannot build anything or create anything. They have been gift through out thier life with oil gold and natural gas. Now they are realizing that without it they will lose everything they build. So it countermeasures #SyriaIsBleeding

1864 2018-02-26 20:12:03 Coach: "I see your price says $29 for an oil change.  How much to get it changed in the next 10 min?"

1886 2018-02-26 20:09:07 Joyce may have been a Queensland senator but he is not a Queenslander.  So how might I ask was he so important in Queensland.  I'm a Queenslander and would have loved to pour a gallon of oil over him to SHUT UP the squeaky wheel.
1887 2018-02-26 20:09:00 Ugly, inconevenient but true of Nigeria. What the world glosses over (this time conveniently) is that every nation has done pretty much the same en route to building its local economy. As it was for railways and oil in the US, Russia etc this is Nigeria's time.

1893 2018-02-26 20:08:30 As for SDF, Mr smarty pants. You're probably aware that ex-ISIS fighters have been integrated into it, right? Especially east of Euphrates to occupy oil fields there and keep the ISIS pockets that SAA would have easily crushed by now.
1894 2018-02-26 20:08:22 It honestly just tastes like bbq sauce mixed with sweet and sour, with a touch of sesame oil. #SzechuanSauce should honestly stay on the menu tho. I know @McDonalds tried having an Asian sauce in their rotation before other than Szechuan but this has a mass appeal.
1895 2018-02-26 20:08:04 Hott.
1896 2018-02-26 20:07:51 Of course guys but in different forms if recycled. Which is why the single use aspect of plastics still consumes natural resources. Our dependence on oil would be reduced if we increase the % of recycled plastic in the eternal plastic lifecycle. We are improving daily.

1924 2018-02-26 20:05:38 Oil prices are down and new mines have not been allowed to open so revenues aren’t keeping up with the budget. Last year revs only covered 1/4 of budget spending. Allowing Mining would help help curb the debt downward and improve local economy.

1935 2018-02-26 20:04:10 The fact you drive a turbo engine doesn’t mean your price should shoot up. It just means you’d need an oil change more often. Only real reason it would cost more is synthetic vs. regular motor oil, and how many liters you’re using. Shop around
1936 2018-02-26 20:04:08 I started using CW CBD oil for my nerve pain, which was so bad I cried daily and couldn't sleep for months. I now have it under control with 1/2 tsp 2x daily. Amazing stuff!
1937 2018-02-26 20:04:07 Before everyone went mad they used to use a mix of tallow, beef olein (isolated MUFA) and just a dash of seed oil. This would be close to human depot fat ratios, and <30% SFA.

1977 2018-02-26 19:58:47 You chose the life of a pornstar, correct? There a understandable and tangible consequences to that lifestyle. You can’t expect and oil rig worker to not expect a fire or a cop to not expect the possibility of being shot to death on any day.
1978 2018-02-26 19:58:44 I don't do this shit for nothing
1979 2018-02-26 19:58:42 It’s weirder. Cacao seeds/pulp are heaped/put in wood boxes to undergo spontaneous wild fermentation. Internal reactions produce flavor precursors that (once heated) create “cocoa” flavor. 800 known flavor compounds. Most chemically complex natural product other than crude oil.

1981 2018-02-26 19:58:29 just an oil change and he had a slow leak in one of the tires :)
1982 2018-02-26 19:58:21 As someone who works in the oil & gas profession, I can tell you, we practice weekly on random days for a toxic, deadly hydrogen sulfide (H2S) release from the well. There is a genuine fear of complacency with all this practice. Our reaction times suffer greatly w/ foreknowledge.
1983 2018-02-26 19:57:56 This insufferable child has been crying non-stop for the last hour. All I want is an oil change in peace.

1990 2018-02-26 19:57:09 hyaluronic acid and rosehip oil are a huge win but what skin type
1991 2018-02-26 19:57:02 Facts but that's what the dealership here costs to do my oil change theres some euro places here that do it for the fraction of the cost like $40 with the same brand of synthetic oil and filter plus they have the tools to reset the oil check on my car
1992 2018-02-26 19:57:01 Investing in national 5G or better, safer, more efficient, effective  tech?
1993 2018-02-26 19:56:59 It's funny the people critiquing oil are the same ones that grow their trash on the ground expecting others to clean it up
1994 2018-02-26 19:56:49 PST - there is an already legal, and more effective option than medical marij for many issues, not related to the high. check out cbd oil, specifically Ultra Cell by Zilis. More health benefits, no high. Follow for a couple wks if you want more info
1995 2018-02-26 19:56:42 Please oil yourself before sending a strokeo. Have some couth.

1998 2018-02-26 19:56:08 sesame seed oil is findable i think. probably even at a regular supermarket.

i wanted to try making the dish with turkey instead of beef though. because i eat looots of beef regularly lmao.
1999 2018-02-26 19:56:07 And submitted! Yes. A secret little project. Tasty. Now, off to the fifth in the Texas Oil series!!
2000 2018-02-26 19:55:38 I heard that almond oil is good for dark circles/skin, shit man, catch me over here lookin like a nice oil painting covered in this shit lmfao
2001 2018-02-26 19:55:36 Add cheese to chicken and cut the chicken size in half. Dip it in blue cheese and cook it in olive oil. Easy fat additions
2002 2018-02-26 19:55:14 The cans are shown with perspective. The bottles of oil aren’t. We’re looking at a team effort here. There’s a production line of hand painted boxes being produced by the million by multiple artists at a time.

2005 2018-02-26 19:54:45 The truly "long view" for our kids & grandkids would be to stop subsidizing Big Oil with billions & invest in green energy transitions. Plugging a few more tax loophole gifts to @Bill_Morneau @liberal_party cronies wouldn't hurt our grandkids' future either & would save us $ now
2006 2018-02-26 19:54:31 Okay, thin slice, oil, season, and bake potatoes of your choice, and when crisp place to the side of (not on top) your meal.
2007 2018-02-26 19:54:16 Always said a 2nd was the ceiling...hopefully, they can get it.
2008 2018-02-26 19:54:15 I purposely leave work early to get my oil changed thinking everyone will be at work there won’t be a wait.. jokes on me clearly I didn’t think about how there’s more ppl who don’t work then do smh 
2009 2018-02-26 19:54:09 Came to get an oil change during my lunch instead of eating...I think I’m gonna regret it in about 30 minutes
2010 2018-02-26 19:54:01 Im not the spelling, syntax, grammar police.
 as you can tell. 
They are watching though, ready to pounce.
2011 2018-02-26 19:53:39 #Oilers season is eerily reminiscent of the '06-07 team - #Oil win on final day of season to fall behind the #ChicagoBlackHawks in the #NHLDraft. #Hawks then win lottery & take #PatrickKane; #EdmontonOilers draft #SamGagMeWithASpoonGagner. Many more years of futility follow.

2019 2018-02-26 19:52:36 ACA premiums going up due to gop sabotage. Medicaid and Medicare Ryan wants to destroy.  Cost of gas is going up even with oil companies huge tax breaks. Corp tax break is permanent. Americans tax break hahaha is temporary.
2020 2018-02-26 19:52:31 After a deep conversation with my Citrix partners we’ve established that Citrix App Layering is snake oil and can’t do as sold. A 5mth delay on a project means it’s all getting ripped out and starting afresh. Great work @citrix.

2025 2018-02-26 19:52:04 Its more of a case of anti capitalism at a guess.
America wanted him dead , because he goes against everything corporate America , with its illegal and unjust wars funded by oil tycoons and exploitation of people, stands for .
2026 2018-02-26 19:52:03 I wonder if she just dry. Like they didn’t oil her hands. Because they look like that if not oiled after the work is done.
2027 2018-02-26 19:52:02 I thought beard oil only keeps it moisturized

2029 2018-02-26 19:51:21 Hi, the bus is brand new (less than a year old) and is very unlikely to have any leaks - the oil must have been there beforehand. We haven’t seen any stains or leaks at any of our other stops.
2030 2018-02-26 19:51:17 ZS Suprman a man who given himself for humanity and Lois’s freedom. Saved a woman being harrasment and my favorite saved men in oil rig when fishermen can’t do anything.
2031 2018-02-26 19:51:16 Probably an oil or grease. Lotions, coconut oil, olive oil etc.
2032 2018-02-26 19:51:15 Oof. Tough call.  It really depends. Are we dipping fries or putting on salad. I like these for dipping, salad is olive oil, salt and balsamic always.

2039 2018-02-26 19:50:33 Hope inventory report will halt this run.  methinks, it is moving with the market.  DJI recovered 80% from its fall and oil followed.

2041 2018-02-26 19:50:25 Easy overall! PB is just nuts (warmed is good) in food processor with oil, salt and honey to taste. The bread takes longer, but I had my bread machine do the hard work of kneading, then put the dough in the oven. Results were worth it.

2062 2018-02-26 19:48:12 I like to roast it. Cut it in quarters, toss in olive oil, salt & pepper, then roast cut side down on foil-lined pan. Turn to get both cut faces caramelized against the foil.
2063 2018-02-26 19:48:09 Vitamin C and D! And oregano oil supplement works well to lessen effects!
2064 2018-02-26 19:48:01 Would there even be anything left of Philadelphia if the flyers won the cup. How much crisco oil do they have?!
2065 2018-02-26 19:48:01 Its OK it ends in land fill and in 1 Billion years time will become Oil turning the US into a leading oil exporter.
2066 2018-02-26 19:47:58 Most likely forecasted in error to protect the declining oil based economy
2067 2018-02-26 19:47:53 No your right, but right after Japan’s attack you declared war on Germany, as they were allies. It wasn’t altruistic. They brought you into the war. Every other conflict since WWII had been for your economic benifit. Communism in 20th C, terrorists from oil rich countries this C

2075 2018-02-26 19:46:37 That’s a lie. We still importing the bulk of our cooking oil.  Difference is it’s coming in 200litre instead of 2 litre containers

2144 2018-02-26 19:37:30 im genuinely curious how the CBD oil is going. I take it myself for anxiety and depression. Hows it going? is it helping? if not, are you going to try the medical marijuana since it has been legalized in florida?
2145 2018-02-26 19:37:28 That works till the tires don’t get rotated or oil changed.

2173 2018-02-26 19:34:50 Well the bible says the world is 6000 years old and oil comes from Dinosaurs and other animals that died MILLIONS of years ago! So oil doesn't even exist if were gonna use the bible as the authority on our policy, which BTW the constitution specifically prohibits.
2174 2018-02-26 19:34:38 Use the real real African soap not that Shea moisture and if you have marks on your face use Castro oil at night and apply it over your marks and to moisturize use sunscreen or coconut oil .. to get rid of your acne just deep cleanse your face 3 times a day

2193 2018-02-26 19:32:31 The West buys the oil anyway. #Oil smuggling is associated (despite little proof, at least in #Libya) with how terrorist groups raise income. Fighting terror is one of few things the West agrees on, they would rather this not happen. Those that benefit are smugglers/armed groups.

2207 2018-02-26 19:31:15 Free Market Approach translates to continued subsidies to increase profits for oil, gas, and coal while stripping incentives for development of clean renewable energy sources. No secret about who benefits from Republican budgets.

2217 2018-02-26 19:30:07 Rail transport is simply a moving pipeline with increased risk. It is neither the safest, nor the most environmentally sound way to ship our oil. Hear this folks! We need oil and we need the revenue to run this country. Replace your heads in the sand with pipelines in the ground!
2218 2018-02-26 19:29:55 NWO globalists give orders to State Dept. (aka CIA/Deep-State) to...

2) Use as much bombs/weapons as possible - the American taxpayers pay for it
3) Send in THEIR contractors to rebuild.

2223 2018-02-26 19:29:07 That's ok. I'll start a class action suit claiming the state colluded to disrupt commerce and conspired to reap taxes from oil companies who benefited from additional sales due to slow downs of traffic.

Oh, ok 
2234 2018-02-26 19:27:48 There has been mismanagement, yes, but VZ's economic crisis is also a result of US-Saudi alliance to repress global oil prices. What I'm objecting to is the idea that this (KSA's geostrategic partnernship with imperialism & internal authoritarianism) should serve as a model.

2241 2018-02-26 19:26:12 You aren’t diversifying Alberta’s energy industry, you’re destroying it. Solar and wind are practically  useless in our climate.  You act like oil is in the wane but there has yet to be a single drop in global demand. Your policies are based on ideology, not reality.

If so, some oil may have entered the barrel, if transported on it's side. It would be smokey, and would clear.

2256 2018-02-26 19:24:45 Observation. Most of this stuff in US and other places 35 yrs and younger. Should legislation target this group?
2257 2018-02-26 19:24:44 What's your party's policy? Let the rich run the country and it will work itself out. Alberta has one of best economies in the country right after a global downturn in oil. Do you not know what you are talking about or are you purposely being this ignorant?

2265 2018-02-26 19:24:06 UWM police: No damage to student union from car fire that started with oil leak.
2266 2018-02-26 19:23:46 ive rosehip oil in my damn eyes......
2267 2018-02-26 19:23:27 After intense discussions with the club’s hierarchy we (going for the 3rd ) reluctantly accept the FA’s unfair and compromised charges. We will not be taking this to the courts.
2268 2018-02-26 19:23:18 Go get em!!!!
2269 2018-02-26 19:23:11 Raise the oil and gas tax you guys cut in 2016 to keep our excellent State employees working in our state.
2270 2018-02-26 19:23:04 Every Tuesday we'll be focusing on a different ingredient and this week our "#ingredients revealed" will feature an amazing ancient seed #oil
Hint: it is the richest plant source of #squalene! Can you guess the oil?  #organicskincare #naturalskincare #greenbeauty #moisturizer
2271 2018-02-26 19:23:02 Not much different from Tentacle Porn Eichenwald’s post-election tip to sell up.
2272 2018-02-26 19:23:01 I have an air diffuser and lemon grass essential oil. I mix it with a little peppermint. It makes my house smell so fresh.
2273 2018-02-26 19:22:55 Yeah....
No sources.
Dont know scottish lingo
Dont know scottish economics
Dont know your GDP
Dont know EU regulation
Dont know economic sectors of scotland
Dont know how oil extraction works
Dont know who the leader of the scottish movement was
Dont know much tbh.

2274 2018-02-26 19:22:54 @JoMaloneLondon bath oil is heavenly i am an addict to pomegranate noir 
2275 2018-02-26 19:22:51 Yes and put castor oil on it!!
2276 2018-02-26 19:22:40 Bought .WTICR 62.69 $WTI #Oil #Olieprijs #Olie #Beleggen
2277 2018-02-26 19:22:10 i’m so excited for beach days, jet skis, boating, swimming, cute bikinis, & loads of coconut oil
2278 2018-02-26 19:22:02 I suggested years ago that our US military should get a long term oil contrat with the Russians..build storage, a refinery or two,refine the oil and continually dump on the market what we don't use for our military!! Wow..that would piss some special interest groups off!
2279 2018-02-26 19:21:50 mostly creds to my teacher @xizzymayx but the baby oil was my idea
2280 2018-02-26 19:21:46 New, unexpected tires on. Now off to the dealer to find out why my engines burning oil. Then it looks like I have to go to a client for a warranty job. Worst Monday off ever. 
2281 2018-02-26 19:21:43 Well, when Birute Gildekas is fine with it, then we will be too. But so far the @OrangutanFndn says there’s no such thing as sustainable, oil. They spend HUGE amounts of energy trying to save the Orangutan. The @girlscouts  should be MORE RESPONSIBLE! BTW, I was a Girl Scout
2282 2018-02-26 19:21:42 My impression of the words coming out of his mouth, that's all. It's LIKE he's selling snake oil -- that's what he seems like to me. 

I'll probably be wrong about this, but with this guy, it seems (again, to me) that there's no there there.
2283 2018-02-26 19:21:36 Dropped my truck off at @jiffylube for an oil change, come back and my keys are missing. Worker had to drop me off at work. Bad case of the Monday’s clearly. Stay tuned to see if I can get home from work.
2284 2018-02-26 19:21:29 What is Oil?

Did I win?

Soul, Horse & Oil
2285 2018-02-26 19:21:17 Well, I did that math, and apparently the world ran out of oil yesterday.

In unrelated news, can anyone tutor me in energy systems?
2286 2018-02-26 19:21:16 …not to mention certain players doing very well on Golan oil/gas resources
2287 2018-02-26 19:21:01 You know how people advocate coconut oil for self care? Same but with garlic.
2288 2018-02-26 19:20:58 Just a diff route to push idea gov should dictate personal habits and legislation is preferable
2289 2018-02-26 19:20:49 Refining at home adds value to the economy, which is something the oil industry chooses not to do.
2290 2018-02-26 19:20:45 Mindful Monday! Mindfulness practices for good health: In honor of the opening of the Grapefruit  League: mix up a batch of revitalizing body oil...10 drops grapefruit essential oil to 8oz grape seed oil
2291 2018-02-26 19:20:44 tell that to the people swearing up and down that solar and renewable energy kills oil based jobs. How's about you hold yourself to your own standards.
2292 2018-02-26 19:20:41 Did they check your oil, wash your window, check the air in your tires too?
2293 2018-02-26 19:20:37 I used to swear to myself I was never going to work in an office or for an oil company and look at me now. Don’t do it. Please don’t let it suck you in
2294 2018-02-26 19:20:11 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
2295 2018-02-26 19:19:55 I meant to say I use neem oil. You can take it’s just nasty using cranberry juice helps a lot more than orange juice
2296 2018-02-26 19:19:47 Has anyone ever actually bought their mother Oil of Olay for Mother’s Day?
2297 2018-02-26 19:19:40 wh- why does the cloth smell like motor oil is he a part time mechanic when he’s not humping kidnap victims
2298 2018-02-26 19:19:36 Classic. Oil, gas and pipeline companies constantly sell project's with promise of local jobs then ship workers in from out of state.
2299 2018-02-26 19:19:27 New Store flyer! (click pic to see larger) Also, Essential Oil Car Vent Clips in stock now!
2300 2018-02-26 19:19:21 It all about the oil offshore Lebanon which some countries want to steal from them
2301 2018-02-26 19:19:16 I got some 12 warning because I mentioned a smug fucker...  Guess which one?
2302 2018-02-26 19:19:15 Mr Hogg is a senior. Perhaps he should present all of his college acceptances to engineering or pre-med programs
2303 2018-02-26 19:19:14 putting baby oil into your slime mixture makes it so clicky and soft 
2304 2018-02-26 19:19:10 Nar I waited till '09 I wanted to make sure the oil money was really coming 🖒
2305 2018-02-26 19:19:09 WoW Italy it’s a start but is that the best an international airport can do? You get better flight and times from the central belt.Still living off the oil industry.
2306 2018-02-26 19:19:00 No OIL, No LIFE!!!
2307 2018-02-26 19:18:49 Idea ppl will buy more broccoli over cookies if that's all you stock is absurd. 
Stores there to sell what consumers want,  not tell them
2308 2018-02-26 19:18:38 It's just a matter of changing the headline really: Unfortunately oil demand may remain strong beyond 2020. Despite our best efforts to establish a clean, modern energy infrastructure, those with a vested interest in holding us back, are determined to do just that 
2309 2018-02-26 19:18:38 What is 1 thing that ur home state has more of than ANY other place? Example: In TX, would it be steer? BBQ joints? Oil rigs? What about my home, TN: Black bears? Country music attractions? Can u think of anythng that ONE state specifically has a monopoly on over ANY other state?
2310 2018-02-26 19:18:23 It's not just the oil they sell to us.  They have committed to trade all oil in USD.  If they switch that to the Euro, etc. it would be devastating.
2311 2018-02-26 19:18:21 You know it was a good weekend when you find a knife in your olive oil/spice cabinet on Monday
2312 2018-02-26 19:18:21 ask DELTA  if they allow their pilots or Air Marshals to carry arms.
2313 2018-02-26 19:18:17 Take neem oil. I use that for my acne. Diamond use for her eczema it’s amazing! I put a drop of oregano in it my face clear up in couple days. For baby maybe not a whole drop because it’ll burn on open wound.
2314 2018-02-26 19:18:16 my team is preparing a report,but am afraid the pulpit is placed on one of Naija's oil wells,that's how we roll,
2315 2018-02-26 19:18:13 @tartecosmetics Hello, I’ve heard lots of great reviews about the Maracuja oil. I already use Elemis Superfood and Marine oil. Is it ok if I was to layer the Maracuja with the Elemis oils? As I don’t want to overload my skin. Thanks xx
2316 2018-02-26 19:18:10 I need a oil change and a car wash I might as well do them both since off im off
2317 2018-02-26 19:17:56 wait I know obvi cause I’m a chick they’re tryna jip me but like $100 for an oil change ??? Cause I have a turbo engine?? I said no so then they said $75 ???? Gentlemen help
2318 2018-02-26 19:17:56 Hmmm that is a hard one. These days, I wonder if investigative journalism can really help? Sometimes it exposes problems but afterwards nothing is really done. Look at the Russia voting  fraud case or the Zarrab gold for Oil case.  People are upset and then move one.
2319 2018-02-26 19:17:23 Chef Skinner cut up some carrots, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was chicken, along with toothpaste.
2320 2018-02-26 19:17:21 Craving for truffle oil pastaaaaaaa
2321 2018-02-26 19:17:17 $1000 cant even pay a families medical premiums! Your out of touch with the reality of ordinary Americans! You cannot pull the wool over the people eyes with your snake oil!
2322 2018-02-26 19:17:14 Also interesting that revolutions only happened in countries DirectX at the Mediterranian: Tunesian, Lybia, Egypt, Syria...Not in second line. After UN recognized Fatah government and Hamas/Fatah spoke about 'unity government' Israel attacked Gaza so palestinians cant get oil/gas
2323 2018-02-26 19:17:12 Completely out of Mastic Oil.
2324 2018-02-26 19:17:10 Probably a smart move for McDaniels. Indy Hotels probably lost his reservation, restaurant food may end up with extra ingredients, and his Uber driver may have thought he wanted a ride to Lucas Oil Raceway in Clermont, IN.
2325 2018-02-26 19:17:00 This nigga be talking hella shit but don’t wanna work, im on my lunch break and you want me to do an oil change that you can do

2327 2018-02-26 19:16:47 Hey athletes, just shut up and play! Hey celebrities, just shut up and sing!  Hey foreign people except for Putin, just shut up and give us oil! Hey black people, just shut up and say all lives matter! Hey students, just shut up and get shot!

2330 2018-02-26 19:16:11 For everyone but a politician funded by oil companies - like our Mr Kenney - the numbers in that chart are a positive sign for Canada. 
#abpoli #cdnpoli
2331 2018-02-26 19:16:05 Malaysians have to complain because we are an primary oil exporters. We should paying high prices for petroleum. It's illogical.
2332 2018-02-26 19:15:58 i

2343 2018-02-26 19:14:41 Best Maccabee miracle since the oil
2344 2018-02-26 19:14:18 If we didn't have resources that are worth dying for, who in their normal mind will spend this kind of money.
Honestly  was finished when we discovered oil.
2345 2018-02-26 19:14:10 Beard oil don finish. Supplier is MIA. Wetin man go do now?
2346 2018-02-26 19:14:09 Had a @PepBoysAuto appointment at 11:00 for an oil change. After waiting 75min, they tell me it’ll be another 15min before they even touch my car. If I can’t trust them to keep the original appt, how can I trust their word? #WastedMorning #CustomerServiceFail #OilChange
2347 2018-02-26 19:13:53 @SkyNews can someone explain to me  what Russia is getting out of this Syrian conflict ?? They must getting something .. oil , gas ??
2348 2018-02-26 19:13:50 Not terribly torn up over it. And I believe only HALF of what I see.
2349 2018-02-26 19:13:49 No oil
2350 2018-02-26 19:13:42 I’ll bring you some tea tree oil sis

2352 2018-02-26 19:13:32 My guess is the Sharks are getting the Sharks on the cheap...very nice move if that is indeed the case.
2353 2018-02-26 19:13:29 went to go get my oil changed yesterday and it still says 0% oil life wtf
2354 2018-02-26 19:13:04 Woah that is a bad one hated chim on the oil.
2355 2018-02-26 19:12:58 Great example about oil and control. Its why the UN is so crooked.
2356 2018-02-26 19:12:54 would you put coconut oil on your face?
2357 2018-02-26 19:12:39 Black seed oil cures everything but death... It’s one herb you can have much of but if you eat bad which I know you don’t you’ll be able tell. Same with oregano oil but it’s strong  can’t take too much but I been taking it for about year now and I see the results!
2358 2018-02-26 19:12:38 #wvgov stop sleeping with oil and gas and tax them more to fix the roads they are badly destorying.
2359 2018-02-26 19:12:22 LOL...It leaked/burned about a quart of oil each shift.  You’d leave smelling like burnt oil.  But at least it had a lightbar. Eventually it gave up and was replaced with a 1 ton Dodge stake truck that only had roof clearance lights until I could be fixed.
2360 2018-02-26 19:11:55 TEA TREE OIL
2361 2018-02-26 19:11:55 Traditional medicine is just snake oil for the weak-minded. 

Shameful that a Zambian parliamentarian can encourage such. 

#ashamedzambian
2362 2018-02-26 19:11:53 Trumps okaying the pipeline has been left in the dust of his tyrannical tweets along with the fact that the Koch brothers benefitted by furthering epic emissions of greenhouse gasses from the extraction of oil from the tar sands of Canada.
2363 2018-02-26 19:11:51 Stridex pads

Make sure to use moisturizer and apply coats if you need to bc dry skin breaks out, I use cetaphil but like ponds is good too, anything non-camenagemic (idk how to spell lmao) but that means no coconut oil
2364 2018-02-26 19:11:46 Bullish Canadian heavy crude.  Also Bloomberg called the death of Canadian oil producers last week.  Boxes getting checked.
2365 2018-02-26 19:11:34 Just watched a documentary by Chris Packham 'In Search of the Lost Girl' on iplayer. Engaging and moving look at palm oil plantations effect on the Sumatra forest and its hunter-gatherer people. So sad. Now I'm going to try even harder to avoid buying food containing palm oil.
2366 2018-02-26 19:11:33 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2367 2018-02-26 19:11:22 Castor oil has worked on my eyelashes so maybe give that a try
2368 2018-02-26 19:11:21 When seconds count not only are cops minutes away and assessments take time. 
Not a judgement either way, just a fact.
How good was training
2369 2018-02-26 19:11:17 I just want to pour coconut oil all over my life

2371 2018-02-26 19:11:07 Damnn that probably is the reason why he leaked... Must be trying to get his sales up for that coconut oil 
2372 2018-02-26 19:11:06 Don't know you and you don't know me.
I know where cannabis appears in The Bible (eg anointing oil and church incense) and that Santa Claus does not appear except for 2 negative references in Rev. 2 verses 6 and 15.
So are all "religious people" the same like all pot users same?

2393 2018-02-26 19:08:46 Hi Elizabeth. Just to confirm, was the olive oil put in the fridge or stored at room temperature? Naomi
2394 2018-02-26 19:08:45 Yea, keep touting oil no big deal. It's not like the polar caps are 20above normal in the first time ever.
2395 2018-02-26 19:08:37 Quite strange to see that you use Olive oil + Oregano as a medicine, while here in Italy we use them for coooking..... 
2396 2018-02-26 19:08:37 90% sure I accidentally used oil gloss as highlight but it’s cute so it’s staying
2397 2018-02-26 19:08:08 Five of sansodor I mean .. not oil ..

2399 2018-02-26 19:07:38 Are Gigaba still going to use a litre of extra virgin olive oil each morning to balsam his head before going to work no that he possibly wont wrestle with the WMC anymore?
2400 2018-02-26 19:07:25 I realize that things with coconut oil isn’t always good. I’ve tried hair oils and lotion and i don’t see good result from using them...

If you’re trying to lose weight, mix black coffee and 1tsp of coconut oil in a blender.

2409 2018-02-26 19:06:39 And the top of my list, no oil+filter changes, either at the actual frequency needed for ICEs or the dealer-recommended frequency of every 13 miles or 22 minutes, whichever comes first.
2410 2018-02-26 19:06:35 The U.S. has stood for over 200 years. USSR for around 70. Communism doesn't work nor will it ever. Tell me what happened with Venezuela under Chavez's socialism. Was once one of the top oil producers. Now they're nothing. It didn't work there.
2411 2018-02-26 19:06:30 Tariqs a joke nee age shale oil type. Pure scum
2412 2018-02-26 19:06:27 physics prof: in my day we used to use water as lube instead of oil

kid: in my experience water doesn’t really work as lube, it’s definitely more painful.

2414 2018-02-26 19:06:05 I wonder if bae love me enough to oil my scalp when I get home lol
2415 2018-02-26 19:05:45 waiting to get a oil change and this old lady keep staring at me 
2416 2018-02-26 19:05:39 veggie suet is usually made with palm oil, which is terrible for the environment. Swings and roundabouts really.
2417 2018-02-26 19:05:19 I want originality, and individuality. Most of these novels and short stories are  just reworded, and recycled ideas. 
Where's the freshness like a summer salad from the Italian countryside with cherry ripe tomatoes, and freshly baked bread with freshly made olive oil.
2418 2018-02-26 19:05:09 @salinaslucia Una firma extranjera pagará el impuesto que debe Oil Combustibles....

Se sabe cual es la firma??? Gracias
2419 2018-02-26 19:05:05 If they can't strike a decent deal, means opportunity to re-sign him at a favorable salary.  Less risk of losing to big UFA offers. This is best case for Oil really.
2420 2018-02-26 19:04:47 There is Shale oil in Alberta aswell

2427 2018-02-26 19:03:52 Pretty sure the carbon tax will be gone if they are elected, heck we may even be able to ship LNG to Asia, and get more than 50 cents on the dollar well moving oil out of the country.   We live one of the richest resource nations per capita, but are squandering it.
2428 2018-02-26 19:03:50 Maybe I put too much oil in the dough...
2429 2018-02-26 19:03:48 Thanks to American pharmaceutical subsidized medicine and capitalist demand for oil, their children no longer die of disease or starvation, so the population keep multiplying. Despite corruption and some chaotic regions, Nigeria has relative stability and better economic policies
2430 2018-02-26 19:03:44 Yep. The average oil industry profit margin is 9-11%.
Retail: 3-5 %
Big Pharma: 17%
These are NET profits.
Takeaway big government and big Pharma is crippled from the lack of Medicaid and Medicare.
2431 2018-02-26 19:03:38 Of course my oil is more expensive for  the Chevy and of couuuurrrrse they don’t have my filters here so I have to wait for them to go get one. 
2432 2018-02-26 19:03:29 How much money have you been given by oil and gas lobbyists?
2433 2018-02-26 19:03:24 The benefits of fish oil for heart health include:

It can increase levels of HDL (good) cholesterol.

 It can lower triglycerides by 15–30% 

 Even in small doses, it helps reduce blood pressure

Prevent plaques which form in arteries causing them to       harden

2435 2018-02-26 19:03:06 @elonmusk 1000s of Children are dying in syria for the greed of oil.. increase in the sale of ur own battery cars will save Millions of life. Request you to crash the oil industry which kills millions nd destroy earth.

2443 2018-02-26 19:02:52 Just wondering how much snake oil by volume there is.
2444 2018-02-26 19:02:37 This guy will dig for oil in your back yards$$$

2446 2018-02-26 19:02:31 I think it's basically: tahini, chickpeas and olive oil. Then add other flavors.
Do you have food processor? Also please bring some over when you're done.
2447 2018-02-26 19:02:30 Dammit I didn’t think of that! I had my niece do it since I’m getting a stinkin oil change right now. Ugh! Anyone else you know getting through?

2450 2018-02-26 19:01:57 I had a bootleg copy of the Goo album.
2451 2018-02-26 19:01:51 A perpfect solution to this problem would be to switch to renewable energy and lessen our reliance on deadly, environment-destroying tar sands oil :)
2452 2018-02-26 19:01:37 I love them. So much. They were one of the first bands I really got into. I think I was in the 7th grade.

2468 2018-02-26 18:59:25 I once had a christian fundamentalist creationist claim that saving fossil fuels was a sin because god gave us just enough oil to last until the The End Times, and saving it put off The End and defied god's will. People that drove gas guzzlers were on a holy mission.
2469 2018-02-26 18:59:09 HOW MUCH DOES CANADA GIVE OUT IN FOSSIL FUEL SUBSIDIES?

About $3.3 billion for oil and gas producers (currency in Canadian dollars).

2472 2018-02-26 18:58:28 What is up @Bubba_Trading ???  OIL ( WTI ) my good man. It keeps ringing that $64 spot. ding-ding...  Happy Monday Mr. B.
2473 2018-02-26 18:58:27 What the contractor brushes like John? Do you use them in both oil and water based?
2474 2018-02-26 18:58:25 And maybe that’s where another misunderstanding lies. Some people view makeup as an art form just like oil painting and do it for expression, stress relief, and self-satisfaction.

2484 2018-02-26 18:57:55 or 95% per barrel. And stop all government funds going to the oil and gas sector.  Ask the citizens of Canada.
2485 2018-02-26 18:57:36 Yeah, they were on the washing machine tour, I think. All I remember was that they played erics trip and I was happy

2491 2018-02-26 18:56:53 It would be nice if these environmentalists would figure out what products are made from and with oil and try going a month without any such products. My bet is not one of them could do it.

2493 2018-02-26 18:55:54 Flat earth is a big deal but, we need to go further. The rabbit hole goes way deeper. The pineal gland, the anointing oil/chrism, the chakras, the fact that you can manifest your experiences. They don’t want you to have that power.

2545 2018-02-26 18:48:51 3/ While traders may maintain positions of the crude oil ERC20 token, therefore driving down its velocity, the vast majority of the M of that token would go to the owners of the underlying crude, not speculative investors in the token prior to the token being tethered to the oil.

2547 2018-02-26 18:48:31 FYI: those crafts which require baby oil and glitter to be sealed in a cute little vial are a b*tch to clean up when they leak / break.
2548 2018-02-26 18:48:28 I know its awful the boiler is broke we thought we just ran out of oil but no 
2549 2018-02-26 18:48:19 okay......... but.. oil change????
2550 2018-02-26 18:48:15 Good bands.
2551 2018-02-26 18:48:10 Here’s an idea-how about you stop spouting about things you know nothing about.  You’re being used
2552 2018-02-26 18:48:02 Why does he need an excuse? Is there no vodka left in the world? No cheap Scotch, tasting of fuel oil and charred electrical insulation? No bottom-shelf bourbon, with its delicate bouquet of rotting hog slop?
2553 2018-02-26 18:47:55 You do have to admit that Tories know a thing or two about Snake Oil Sales!
2554 2018-02-26 18:47:48 Fuck you. I hate you now. <cries inconsolably>
2555 2018-02-26 18:47:34 Of course, spokesman for big oil companies wants to pressure politicians to favour them. @JustinTrudeau will probably listen to them more than he listens to the majority of people of Canada.
2556 2018-02-26 18:47:33 Corp bribed Sen Pipelines, oil/naturalGas r not necessary We would be better off without them We want Local free solar/wind
2557 2018-02-26 18:47:26 The US is getting a return on all of the money they have been giving people like @Tzeporah @Greenpeace to denounce Alberta oil. Our governments are pathetic to have let this happen. #UCP #abpoli
2558 2018-02-26 18:47:12 Yes.
2559 2018-02-26 18:46:40 Congratulations on the win!!!!
2560 2018-02-26 18:46:36 Just the two wells at lidsey

Angus seeks another 10 years at Lidsey oil site
BY RUTH HAYHURST ON FEBRUARY 26, 2018• ( 1 COMMENT )
The oil company, Angus Energy, has applied for permission to produce from its Lidsey site near Bognor Regis in West Sussex for another 10 years.
2561 2018-02-26 18:46:31 Yes! I’m gonna read from the beaches of Tel Aviv and Mykonos! Just lay my butt in the sun, lathered up with sustain oil with a cool (non booze) drank! Lil umbrella on top! Can’t wait!!! 
2562 2018-02-26 18:46:22 Castor oil one
2563 2018-02-26 18:46:19 why are ~turkey sending troops into Syria? why are they supporting,Islamic state,by sending weapons and buying oil?? The same will stain Turkey for generations. Murdering dog Edogan , the muhammedan.
2564 2018-02-26 18:46:02 @browardsheriff  is a snake oil salesman. He is a charlatan. He says what he thinks people want to hear, he accepts responsibility for nothing & he throws his own men under the bus then backs over them. He is weak and is the wrong person for that job, how the hell did he get it?
2565 2018-02-26 18:45:58 Another cream puff who was never even owned a gun before and desperate to get rid of them out of his own fear and lack of knowledge, uses a high school shooting to give him a leg to stand on in the gun control debate.   Typical.  Tiring.    I think I will go oil my M4 right now.

2567 2018-02-26 18:45:51 Ok name one country that Muslims invaded and improved? Saudi only improved using the Wests oil money and the Wests workers and tech so you can't have that. Afghanistan and Iran turned into shitholes and Sweden is now the rape capital of Europe France is mess.muslims have bad reps
2568 2018-02-26 18:45:50 Because there is a fuck ton of oil in Texas and California has to import more.
2569 2018-02-26 18:45:50 Hmmm, ever heard of Tides? Steyer? Rockefeller? Do you know - every barrel of oil not from Canada will come from somewhere else? Who do you support? Idiot.
2570 2018-02-26 18:45:46 My man changed my oil yesterday and helped me wash my car. Now that's a keeper 
2571 2018-02-26 18:45:38 A cursory look at India, the mainstay of the economy is the entertainment industry, human capital, and then technology.

Innovation drives the world.

Nigeria is stagnant because there is no innovation either in oil exploration or agriculture.
2572 2018-02-26 18:45:29 Thanks for your feedback! To meet the needs of more of our guests, the Waffle Fries & Hash Browns are cooked in canola oil. However, because each of our locations are individually owned & operated, please confirm the use of canola oil with your local Chick-fil-A.
2573 2018-02-26 18:45:26 Sadly Lewis was on the wrong side of the North Sea and couldn’t claim the oil wealth for itself to fund vast metropolises & skyscrapers built by downtrodden immigrants
2574 2018-02-26 18:45:10 
2575 2018-02-26 18:44:52 Oh please now — OPEC is going back off reductions. Oil output will surge & oil price will drop, energy stocks will be hurts hight when inflation and the prime are up which will hurt the hurting house market - big correction will occur. This is is not rocket science.
2576 2018-02-26 18:44:43 1/ If you tokenised, say, crude oil, to would be creating a new ERC20 token (or some other future layer 2 substitute) and the trade in that token would be denominated in that token.  The Ethereum network would just be providing cloud compute services to that token.
2577 2018-02-26 18:44:32 i know once they finish with this oil change i’m going to doctors care
2578 2018-02-26 18:44:22 $60 for a fucking oil change bruh
2579 2018-02-26 18:44:18 Yeah that what Rockefeller said about Standard Oil too.
2580 2018-02-26 18:44:17 I saw Sonic Youth play at UGA's Legion Field in 1995 for $11. #coolstorybro
2581 2018-02-26 18:44:17 Somebody teach this boy what a BTU is, and that like his gun ban, he doesn't have a chance in hell of getting there from here.

2583 2018-02-26 18:44:08 There is absolutely no economic reason to lower royalties. It isn't about making money off oil companies. Its about making sure the oil companies who can lease land for oil drilling have skin in the game.  Its almost like they've never studied the tragedy of the commons in school
2584 2018-02-26 18:43:56 PSA: while it might seem like a good idea, i can confirm that extra virgin olive oil does not go on keyboards. It can go on everything else, but not keyboards.

Hour 3 into evoo extraction from my keyboard my loving brother decided to pour on it while i was in the ER

2594 2018-02-26 18:43:01 And Alberta taxpayers will pay for that?  Not the oil companies?
2595 2018-02-26 18:42:53 Nothing like 350 degree oil to the face

2597 2018-02-26 18:42:49 my beard + hair are crying out for some sweet almond oil
2598 2018-02-26 18:42:44 How about profits from foreign agents acting on behalf of governments, lobbyists, intermediaries, oil executives, heck NRA?
2599 2018-02-26 18:42:30 this is could stop just after the embargo on their oil and gas
2600 2018-02-26 18:42:25 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
2601 2018-02-26 18:42:25 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

2607 2018-02-26 18:42:08 Whenever we got off the gold standard in 1972 we have been in constant battle in the middle east for control of the oil. Oil is the commodity that backs the dollar. Saddam said he would stop trading oil in dollars....GOT INVADED. Iran is threatening also....about to get invaded.
2608 2018-02-26 18:42:01 @exxonmobil Horrible new rebate program for oil changes. Way to help your dealers by giving rebates to Target and Amazon, I'm sure you will gain many repeat sales. What are you thinking?
2609 2018-02-26 18:41:47 I have an Asian housemate who cooks everything with fish oil. I keep making eggs that smell like a rotten, fishy vagina. How should I approach this?
2610 2018-02-26 18:41:43 Me too!
2611 2018-02-26 18:41:34 เย้
2612 2018-02-26 18:41:33 Big fan for years. Great job.
2613 2018-02-26 18:41:29 I use a lot of sansodor and some linseed or poppy oil :)
2614 2018-02-26 18:41:28 I agree that oil basically defines the credit (as it does for Saudi Arabia)...but just because its a one-trick pony doesn't mean that you can ignore the trick!
2615 2018-02-26 18:41:26 We should be doubling them. Creating a national oil concern with full profits funding restoration of social security funds and increased pensions for all the next step. Sigh....
2616 2018-02-26 18:41:24 He is bonkers. Absolutely bonkers, biggest snake oil salesman on the planet.
2617 2018-02-26 18:41:23 my nickname at work is olive oil and i guess i’m just gonna embrace that bc it won’t go away. 
2618 2018-02-26 18:41:07 My wife started using sephora, and broke out. Switched to making shit out of all these ingredients to much better results. Coconut oil is in like ALL of it.
I am so confused now as to how.
2619 2018-02-26 18:41:03 The same reason coal and oil industry get to run the EPA, private school industry runs public education, corporations dictate tax policy, etc. The lobbyists run the executive branch now.
2620 2018-02-26 18:41:00 Amber attracts all things to it but garden-basil, and things smeared with oil, between which there is a natural antipathy.
2621 2018-02-26 18:40:41 My friend said yall taking to long to tag me in them Safaree pics cuz she tryna see if he worth buying coconut oil for or not

2623 2018-02-26 18:40:33 Other than the fact that they take a lot of loans, it is hard to understand how telecom companies operate really. Data......, the new oil will burn a lot of money.
2624 2018-02-26 18:40:29 I now put coconut oil to my coffee in addition to eating raw garlic and drinking pure cranberry juice in an ongoing effort to never die, which is quite different than how I used to be.

2630 2018-02-26 18:39:41 (2/2) to decide on the punishment and rules. We (going for 3rd s ) argue that this FA AND the clubs supporting it has a lot to gain from these punishments, thus making it an illegitimate FA with illegitimate charges. We think the courts will support this view.

2632 2018-02-26 18:39:37 Those pepperonis were moved for this picture. Look at the oil drops on the inside of the box and the greasy finger prints on the outside of the box. This is fake news.
2633 2018-02-26 18:39:31 Dammit. Monday is Sonic Youth/Fugazi day in the office. Tool is not until Wednesday.
2634 2018-02-26 18:39:27 I'm sure you must have bloody shares in coriander and olive oil.
2635 2018-02-26 18:39:23 The decision to do the building work or move has been made easier by awesome neighbours, he’s checked my oil and topped my logs up 
2636 2018-02-26 18:39:21 I think Russia’s fundamentals deteriorated in 1994. Russia’s creditworthiness is basically the oil price. All the chart says is that oil bounced back.
2637 2018-02-26 18:39:18 Makeup remover is always a good step and or coconut oil
2638 2018-02-26 18:39:18 USA is on wars for oil since a while. it seems you missed the news.
2639 2018-02-26 18:39:13 I had time to kill while getting my oil changed soooo just dropped coint on toys and treats for my dog...why do I do this 
2640 2018-02-26 18:39:11 มันก็ดีเหมือนกัน
2641 2018-02-26 18:38:59 See fat head. The oil in ur head is affecting ur brain. U dont even know the facts. Federal govt land? did u say that?? All state land my friend is vested in the Governor..
2642 2018-02-26 18:38:38 You stated that I was ignorant of the 1973 oil crisis, which is incorrect. I did economics at post graduate level. My comments regarding the IMF were correct, the crisis was ‘global’ but the UK’s issues were largely of its own making.
2643 2018-02-26 18:38:36 Have you tried surgical spirit on it? Or nail polish remover? Or baby oil? 

You might also be able to gently sand it off with light sandpaper
2644 2018-02-26 18:38:29 Is he talking about Russian oil to NK?  Nah, can't be that logical....
2645 2018-02-26 18:38:14 And I used; Ahriman Blue as the base, Nuln oil, then layered a various mix of AB with Lothern blue and White scar building up.  For accents, it was Screamer pink as base, Nuln, then Layered mix of SP with Emperors Children to White scar. Metals Leadbelcher, nuln, stormhost silver
2646 2018-02-26 18:38:14 Impossible to pick just one but Pliny the Elder, Heady Topper, and Harviestoun Old Engine Oil are among my favorites

2650 2018-02-26 18:37:10 I’m so proud of myself .. i paid for my own oil change for the first time today !!! 
2651 2018-02-26 18:37:08 good lord, i hate oil burns >_<
2652 2018-02-26 18:37:02 I have to get an oil change today 
2653 2018-02-26 18:36:49 Tell me about it. I have an app GasBuddy I check to see the price if oil going anywhere. You fill up & pass a gas station that is 15 cents less. How
2654 2018-02-26 18:36:47 Its about CONTROL of the oil....you control the oil, you control nations. Whether U.S. exports oil is irrelevant.
2655 2018-02-26 18:36:37 (1/2)Wow. It’s really disappointing that our league is letting this FA continue presiding over this league. Our great club (going for 3rd ) is considering taking this to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. (An independent person from this league)
2656 2018-02-26 18:36:21 I’m enjoying the implied suggestion that in stark contrast to Corbyn’s snake oil, May has a clear, straightforward and workable plan.
2657 2018-02-26 18:36:18 For sure but the difference is you could see the decline for Seabrook was on the immediate horizon. The drop we have seen in Lucic has come far quicker than anyone anticipated.
2658 2018-02-26 18:36:16 Show me the coconut oil plz
2659 2018-02-26 18:36:15 Concoction mix... Cocoa butter, Shea butter, olive oil, coconut oil, castor oil, and any other oil unataka
2660 2018-02-26 18:36:02 It’s kinda washing your hands with used car oil, or using bacon fat as hand sanitizer. Although the smell would be irresistible.
2661 2018-02-26 18:36:02 This kid is unreal. He looks like Zac Efron’s weird cousin, and it’s like he’s totally disconnected from the events he’s discussing. It’s weird.

2663 2018-02-26 18:35:49 For creativity or a mood boost, use tangerine essential oil. 
2664 2018-02-26 18:35:41 I seriously need to do this my but my hair takes two washes for the oil to get out of my hairI just can’t stand it
2665 2018-02-26 18:35:38 I dropped $350+ on 4 tires and an oil change I feel ya pain bruh...

2667 2018-02-26 18:35:29 That's ok. Midland is getting as trashy as Odessa. When the oil field booms so does the trash.
2668 2018-02-26 18:35:25 Earlier Gaddafi now Assad choose wisely fellow people of syria what do you want peace or civil war for eternity these nato countries are scumbags they will destroy you . They only care about your oil
2669 2018-02-26 18:35:23 it's great to see a loser anonymous Trumpkin troll with 29 fake followers try to cover up for him and relentlessly stalk me trying to get attention. Get lost, Pumpkin.
2670 2018-02-26 18:35:21 @BBCNWT  on tonight's news there was a young family on who have a young child who suffers with several epilepsy attacks and are trying out the cannabis oil. I would like to let them know that Holland and barrat sell it and I'm sure it's a lot cheaper. Worth a try .
2671 2018-02-26 18:35:21 My stomach hurts really bad since this afternoon so I tried earlier: Sprite. Efficascent Oil. Tea. Hot Compress. Ointment. Dulcolax. Then after almost two hours still nothing changed, it hurts still. So I tried Kremil S, then wow after 5 minutes the pain is gone really.
2672 2018-02-26 18:35:17 Exactly what trump and BIG OIL is WANTING!
2673 2018-02-26 18:35:12 Hey, can I have some oil, dis bitch is thirsty
2674 2018-02-26 18:35:10 - Why The Man At Delta Sonic Said My Oil Change Was Gonna Be Hella Expensive So I Asked The Price He Says $42.99  Nigga  Thats Cheap I Thought He Was Boutta Say Like $100 Or Sumn

2676 2018-02-26 18:35:00 @IainDale It is True that the Americans have taken over Syrian Oil Fields in Eastern Syria.   You really must do some digging at to what is Really happening in Syria.
If you would like some Twt links for further info let me know.
2677 2018-02-26 18:35:00 This oil change taking years
2678 2018-02-26 18:34:51 Just had to drop 700 on tires, 89 on oil change, and 35 on inspection sticker. Ready to puke. 
2679 2018-02-26 18:34:51 Like I just want my parents to question why I'm single or can't find a job. Not grill me on the socioeconomic status of Malaysia as palm oil exports decrease. Like I don't know! Ask me about how shitty my day is or something!
2680 2018-02-26 18:34:44 What’s the point of making an appointment for an oil change at @Ford and still having to wait 2 hours and have everyone be rude?????????????? And nobody telling me apparently my warranty is up???
2681 2018-02-26 18:34:36 You think that their currency doesn’t have an international exchange rate? And it still provides a floor, which is that of the peg value of a barrell of oil.
2682 2018-02-26 18:33:58 That seem to exceptionally well organized and financed for a bunch of “victim kids”
2683 2018-02-26 18:33:53 Made me cry...

2685 2018-02-26 18:33:37 I walk into dischem intending to buy just the coconut oil which is 50bucks  

Walk out with crap worth 450 is dischem is a trap
2686 2018-02-26 18:33:27 What do you add to your oil paint to make it flow so easily, please?
2687 2018-02-26 18:33:27 causally texting my dad saying the honda needs an oil change and praying that he tells me the jetta is finally driveable lololol
2688 2018-02-26 18:33:07 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!
2689 2018-02-26 18:33:03 Christian and Syrians give up that oil and gas pipeline! For the Zionist movement
2690 2018-02-26 18:32:58 If he had said use the planned parenthood money .....he would have never been on tv again.
2691 2018-02-26 18:32:46 Finally, where exactly besides VZ do you think you can spend the VZ currency they're going to pay you in?  At least you could take the oil and use it elsewhere, which is the whole reason why it would be compelling and the oil's value in hyper-inflating currency is not
2692 2018-02-26 18:32:21 It's also a great alternative for beard oil .
2693 2018-02-26 18:32:15 Bro A Oil Change Don’t Never Take This Long
2694 2018-02-26 18:32:12 I'm on my own this evening; the temptation is to eat rubbish but I've put some tomatoes, onions in the oven to roast, with olive oil & some Moroccan spices.
2695 2018-02-26 18:32:05 @IainDale the golon heights in Syria. Major oil field Occupied by Israeli troops. Genie energy hold the rights. Know your facts my friend
2696 2018-02-26 18:32:00 What i see is an oil marketer that needs the govt to pay the money they owe and a refinery owner that can make the govt not need the oil marketer
2697 2018-02-26 18:31:48 Finally getting my oil changed 
2698 2018-02-26 18:31:41 Beautiful day out come see us at Glavan Ford Of Clay center!!  Home of Engines and Oil changes for LIFE!!!
2699 2018-02-26 18:31:40 You know it—as will Camp Couch in Oil Trough, AR!  
2700 2018-02-26 18:31:32 I've heard Neti Pots work for some people although I have not tried one myself. I just take some Advil Cold and Sinus medication. Also, if you have any Eucalyptus essential oil rub that down the bridge of the nose - that opens it up.
2701 2018-02-26 18:31:31 Shave with coconut oil, thank me later
2702 2018-02-26 18:31:27 It was rather obvious the Seabrook deal would come back to bite them and it has.
2703 2018-02-26 18:31:17 Stocks, bonds, gold, oil, DXY are all up. Only VIX (and the GBP) is down.
2704 2018-02-26 18:30:56 Drew. Calling you soon,prepare your baby oil.
2705 2018-02-26 18:30:46 Black seed and oregano oil... Get you some! Especially if you eating all that bs!
2706 2018-02-26 18:30:41 The point is if they are telling the truth, it should never be cheaper to buy VZ oil with petros vs. selling the petros and paying with whatever.  The backing only matters if the price dips below, because it provides a floor on the value since hey, at least it's a claim on VZ oil
2707 2018-02-26 18:30:41 1c Orzo, 1 can chickpeas, cucumber, red onion, 1/2 cup feta & dill. Mix up 3 Tbsp of olive oil & lemon juice, 1 clove garlic, 1 Tbsp chopped dill & salt & pepper. Pour over, mix and smash!
2708 2018-02-26 18:30:40 OIL DIFF: 3.64 -> 3.65
2709 2018-02-26 18:30:39 Most of your investment should be deductible in the first year. You could save thousands of dollars in taxes by investing in Oil & Gas Working Interests. We always suggest consulting with a tax advisor regarding the tax benefits for your specific situation. #oilinvestment
2710 2018-02-26 18:30:31 Paper to allow what happens next.  Should be named the "Oil Measures Act"
2711 2018-02-26 18:30:15 GP I only eat Hippie-Nut-Butter-Crunch. It's the best, what with the separated oil and chunks of peanut shells left in it for roughage.
2712 2018-02-26 18:30:13 4409, you do know that the US is now exporting oil? So your comment is complete bullshit.
2713 2018-02-26 18:30:12 We only wish. But Trudeau is "disinterested" in stepping into an issue between two provinces.. Oil is too dirty for his liking.
2714 2018-02-26 18:30:11 for everyone who found $POTN when it was at .003, you might want to be aware of $VTNL at .001 (today) - CBD oil infused products for pets starting to hit the shelves. If you have a pet with chronic arthritis, you might try this out. I would like to know the results.
2715 2018-02-26 18:30:03 Hell kind of deals to terminate Obamacare and it sort of it and lay back as I said take oil Who the hell kind of mindset that s the problem we send Humvees.
2716 2018-02-26 18:29:54 They are doing that - 30% target by 2030.  There's literally no reason you can't do both. Making our oil extraction and refining more efficient increases revenue and resources for diversifying into alternate energy sources.
2717 2018-02-26 18:29:49 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
2718 2018-02-26 18:29:39 Needs must mate, I’ve been putting it off as one does but I need it fixed before we get any snow up here. My wife has a car but it’s like driving a skateboard on an oil slick 
2719 2018-02-26 18:29:31 I needed an oil change 2,000 miles ago  I'm going today , my ass always forget .
2720 2018-02-26 18:29:31 Yeah.
.A whole plantain, u cut into two or three ... depending on the size
U fry and roll till the outside is slightly brown
Take it out of the hot oil..and find a round plate to press it .
Then re-fry...thats all... Eat with gnut or sauce
2721 2018-02-26 18:29:25 no i don’t have a kit in my hair, i just use coconut oil... nothing more, nothing less
2722 2018-02-26 18:29:23 BREAKING INTEL: Saudi Arabia to trade oil in yuan — and one leg to secure a second special counsel should be a joke? I can literally fact-check them on YouTube. Well here’s the tweet (while continuing to expose the sexual harassment claims against members of Mueller's indictments
2723 2018-02-26 18:29:17 Which was what I expect...free agents & not much else. Had the season gone differently, it's an entirely different discussion.
2724 2018-02-26 18:29:15 Coconut oil or add glycerine kwa lotion
2725 2018-02-26 18:29:09 If they're an oil producing nation then yes, they're going to be selling oil to industrial users.  And no, they don't give you the exact worth - They give you the peg value, which if what they are saying is true will be below the market value.  exchange is a last resort, backing!
2726 2018-02-26 18:29:06 I know most of my family and friends are going to Boycott any of these companies to the best of our abilities. I might also suggest every1 send messages via their websites of our disgust! When your waiting 4 oil change or doc appt take a minute &let them know! It's not ok!!!
2727 2018-02-26 18:28:56 You ask your nigga to pick up on some cleaning in the house and he agrees. He mops the floor with corn oil mistaking it for pine sol. What would you do ?
2728 2018-02-26 18:28:47 Davis exudes snake oil from every orifice.
2729 2018-02-26 18:28:40 Acceptable spreads on sandwiches: dressing, vinaigrette, avocado, oil, sometimes bbq

Unacceptable spreads on sandwiches: mayo, ketchup, mustard,
2730 2018-02-26 18:28:21 What to use in Lieu of Pesticides? Neem Oil, Garlic & Clove Oil, Azatrol, StrawFlower Extract... the list goes on!
2731 2018-02-26 18:28:16 I love when my girl asks me to rub tanning oil I will gladly glaze that ass  up I be acting like it’s a whole damn massage sometimes
2732 2018-02-26 18:28:07 Master chips bysta3mlo palm oil I’m so sad
2733 2018-02-26 18:28:06 Public unions are worse thn private. Employees get hit, taxpayers get hit. 
Gov forces use of " product." 
I don't have choice paying price
2734 2018-02-26 18:27:54 I can't sip no oil if it don't come with a seal 
2735 2018-02-26 18:27:52 Sure but You're still missing the point. The discussion was surrounding a good finish carrying into a next season for the team and it just doesn't work that way.
2736 2018-02-26 18:27:42 The most boring adult thing is waiting by yourself while getting your oil changed -_-
2737 2018-02-26 18:27:34 I should really wash my car today and clean the inside, after I get this oil changed
2738 2018-02-26 18:27:27 .@BNN Ask Larry Berman to stop bullshitting about Alberta politics, the Premier of Alberta is doing more to ensure oil exports from the province than his #YouSeePee and @CPV_HQ Horde buddies ever did #cdnpoli
2739 2018-02-26 18:26:57 So, do you think the dispensary has more people on rainy days or less? I need my meds. Running out of CBD oil.
2740 2018-02-26 18:26:53 Looks chillingly scary with those beady eyes and evil stare- the guy on the right is no oil painting either.
2741 2018-02-26 18:26:41 Yup. My hair doesn’t like coconut oil, and coconut oil clogs pores so easily that it isn’t worth it.
2742 2018-02-26 18:26:41 Hogg is now exploiting this tragedy for his own personal benefit.
2743 2018-02-26 18:26:35 Women are oil. Men are vinegar.

- It's science.
2744 2018-02-26 18:26:28 I thought we had a more pressing crisis right now than the '73 oil shock? Climate change not that urgent? Not worth using all the tools?
2745 2018-02-26 18:26:18 I'd say put your best power bat after them in the cleanup spot, but Mr Coconut Oil has him leading off. Why go for HR's with men on base when you can hit solos?
2746 2018-02-26 18:26:09 Putting lemongrass oil in the diffuser was the best decision I've made all month.
2747 2018-02-26 18:26:08 And you think that’s feasible? What kind of world are you living in? They give you the exact worth of that oil but in your currency and you can go ahead and buy that oil from wherever you want, makes much more sense.
2748 2018-02-26 18:26:07 @0gbaker is this thc oil just weed and coco?
2749 2018-02-26 18:26:02 I'm at it again: Baked Rigatoni, Garlic Bread, and for me Basil, Olive Oil, Sea Salt Salmon. #Bored #Cooking #Fun
2750 2018-02-26 18:26:01 Then it could be a very quiet deadline
2751 2018-02-26 18:25:50 #Brent at $67.76/bbl (+0.70%), #WTI at $64.09 (+0.90%); both oil benchmarks holding on & extending gains from Friday so far #OOTT #oilandgas
2752 2018-02-26 18:25:39 Yeah, uh-huh.  Just like he was itching to get to Vietnam to fight for his country as a young man.  Oh, wait.  That's right.  He's the phoniest, most cowardly sleaze bag to ever occupy the Oval. A carnival barking, snake oil salesman for the ages. #EmptyBarrel.
2753 2018-02-26 18:25:23 I believe he is now on something close to a collar sized leash
2754 2018-02-26 18:25:15 功课压力? plus oil
2755 2018-02-26 18:25:08 In my opinion, the key to great scrambled eggs is to beat the batter with salt, pepper, a tablespoon of whole milk per egg; then fry in a pre-heated hot non-stick pan with extra virgin olive oil. The hotter the pan, the fluffier the eggs, and the cooking only takes seconds.
2756 2018-02-26 18:24:57 What a snake oil salesman! We knew he was a snake, when he announced he’d run!
2757 2018-02-26 18:24:49 Having to drench my hair in coconut oil for a performance is not ideal
2758 2018-02-26 18:24:40 Are company is put American to work are company coming back to are shore an put American to work ! an lower tax Regulation down ! Where the Demo want have company be back to off shore an American on welfare no oil use an higher tax an tell you what to do con
2759 2018-02-26 18:24:38 Of course if you do take it you will smell like fish oil.
2760 2018-02-26 18:24:27 Different but not so different. Successive federal governments are in the pocket of big oil, tax evasion, offshoring and money laundering all but legal.
2761 2018-02-26 18:24:03 I’ve decided to start oil pulling, which is gross, natural, and hilarious.
2762 2018-02-26 18:24:02 A bitch been trying to get an oil change for an hour and half!
2763 2018-02-26 18:24:00 No, I was expecting them to exchange full tankerloads of oil, where the redeemer provides their own tanker and picks it up in VZ.  If they were seriously backing it, you don't need to redeem small stuff - just industrial level.
2764 2018-02-26 18:23:57 I see so many complaints on twitter about America not doing anything to help in Syria, then I see so many complaints about America needing to leave countries alone, because we’re only there for oil, idk what people want anymore
2765 2018-02-26 18:23:51 Personal view is public sector unions need busting. As taxpayers we are held hostage. 
No market, no choice here. We pay or else!!

2766 2018-02-26 18:23:51 It’s because you’re taking a Lamborghini apart in your garage!

Half of the auto YouTubers don’t know how to change their oil.
2767 2018-02-26 18:23:32 The oil money that City have is amazing rather, kev.
2768 2018-02-26 18:23:28 If I hand you an oil bloc nko? 
2769 2018-02-26 18:23:14 Watching oil...seems capped
2770 2018-02-26 18:23:07 I haven’t heard about the oil but figured I give butter a try
2771 2018-02-26 18:23:03 Oil change
2772 2018-02-26 18:22:59 I would spill a bunch of frying oil on me 
2773 2018-02-26 18:22:56 Just blame of oil business to unnecessary to kill the children's what a shame of American Government
2774 2018-02-26 18:22:53 State-run #Sinopec Group said that #China's 2018 crude #oil imports from the U.S. are expected to exceed ten million tons in 2018. China…
2775 2018-02-26 18:22:49 Watch the video of your lie by google Burnaby oil spill Kenney that only cost $15 million too cleanup!
2776 2018-02-26 18:22:43 Hot tip: Take the fish oil capsule after you go to the gym and get sweaty or you will smell like a degenerate villager in an HP Lovecraft story
2777 2018-02-26 18:22:41 Spare me the sanctimony, please. My to dollars go to subsidize everything from cable television to gun manufacturers to the oil industry. God forbid working people have equal bargaining power with their employers
2778 2018-02-26 18:22:38 บางครั้งก็คิดนะถ้าได้เจอความรักดีๆอีกครั้งจะดูแลอย่างดีเลยแต่อย่างว่าความรู้สึกมันไม่เท่ากันหรอกอยุ่คนเดียวอ่ะดีแล้วไม่วุ่นวายไม่ต้องมาทะเลาะหึงนั่นหวงนี้เหนื่อยย!
2779 2018-02-26 18:22:28 Alberta investing in upgrading and value-added oil jobs here in-province. This is the Notley @albertaNDP taking up the mantle left by Premier Lougheed to build a stronger, better province. We would never see this under the sad, short-sighted rip it & ship it @Alberta_UCP. #ableg
2780 2018-02-26 18:22:25 This, and I'd kinda recommend it over talc for anyone honestly. I mostly use baby oil instead of powder though, because I'm unreasonably sensitive.
2781 2018-02-26 18:22:19 How so?
I clearly remember BP oil spill.
In the past corporations would just hire away any uber effective oversight Gov. officials plus lobby Congress to push loophole law oversight.
2782 2018-02-26 18:22:18 Omg you’re killing me, Will. 
2783 2018-02-26 18:21:45 That's what the peanut oil is for.
2784 2018-02-26 18:21:42 It's cute that you think it will take him a week.
2785 2018-02-26 18:21:40 Very bad oil politics. ...is oil greater than human blood ? ...where is humanity ? #SaveSyria...#SaveSyrianChildren. ..#SaveSyria
2786 2018-02-26 18:21:34 Mobile oil is better option
2787 2018-02-26 18:21:30 So I was going to buy a face oil from this IG vendor, asked ingredients of the oil and she stopped replying. Like I should have just paid for delivery for a product I only saw the picture???
2788 2018-02-26 18:21:17 UOA: Everything I've eaten since Saturday has been from Trader Joes.  I have not been happy with a single thing I've eaten since Saturday. Except oddly enough, this chocolate olive oil cake. That? I could eat forever. #Shocker
2789 2018-02-26 18:21:16 《オリーブ油豆知識》

オリーブ油は、オリーブの果実から得られる植物油である。
2790 2018-02-26 18:21:07 It's 10 years since Uganda issued the National Oil and Gas Policy. Still, local content remains weak and the time lines towards oil production remain blurred. Time to reboot.
2791 2018-02-26 18:21:05 Mining is all about ROI. Lesser the investment the easier the ROI. Obviously that does not mean sacrifice quality, more notably it means the development of a smarter build. In this case Mineral Oil and a fish tank.
2792 2018-02-26 18:20:59 I can tell you who needs to change their oil vats
2793 2018-02-26 18:20:57 Yes it’s better! But it’s a certain type of butter . Tom does it. And also adding this one type of oil . Idk what it’s called tho
2794 2018-02-26 18:20:51 @AllenLone v.mah and v.bbi on the move big time. When will the v.moo and v.aao dogs be released. This is an embarrassment! @MrBurberry_ @rigatoni33 @AlmostAMyth @bipolartrader #oil #oilprice #montana
2795 2018-02-26 18:20:33 Hmm Pull into @Valvoline #ValvolineInstantOilChange to get my...oil changed. 2 bays so I pull in line behind 1, Tech tells me to back out so dude beside me can get in my line & has me switch lines THEN makes me move back to where I was? s behind me aren’t having to move now tho
2796 2018-02-26 18:20:32 Look at all the new shipping lanes and places we can drill for oil
2797 2018-02-26 18:20:22 By Friday.
2798 2018-02-26 18:19:49 I’m trying lol this coconut oil better do the trick
2799 2018-02-26 18:19:44 My hair loves coconut oil but my face hates it!
2800 2018-02-26 18:19:43 Yes there are some good republicans but the bad ones are like squeaky wheel! It gets the oil!
2801 2018-02-26 18:19:31 love when my oil painting teacher doesnt open the doors so i feel likw ihave to throw up. realll niccceee
2802 2018-02-26 18:19:28 What families own the Federal Reserve Bank?
The Four Horsemen of Banking (Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo) own the Four Horsemen of Oil (Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch/Shell, BP Amoco and Chevron Texaco); in tandem with Deutsche Bank, BNP, Barclays and other
2803 2018-02-26 18:19:22 Cannabis oil needs to be LEGALISED!!! So much research has gone into it and shown it does in fact work!!!!! #ITVNews
2804 2018-02-26 18:19:18 @STAND_LA The science is clear-there's no such thing as safe neighborhood drilling. Important efforts underway by #CulverCity  community to put health & safety first: ban fracking & impose much larger setbacks in short-term; end oil activity in Inglewood  Oil Field in long-term.
2805 2018-02-26 18:19:11 haha jesus what an obvious, stupid way to go. try harder
2806 2018-02-26 18:19:10 Cannabis oil saves lives and it seems it's our government that are the only ones who can't see it
2807 2018-02-26 18:19:06 Middle of a Siberian blast isnt a good time to run out of heating oil
2808 2018-02-26 18:19:06 There are also new medical info that links palm oil to cancer
2809 2018-02-26 18:19:01 水(ウォーター)とは仲が悪いです。
2810 2018-02-26 18:18:55 I need to get an oil change today
2811 2018-02-26 18:18:52 I hope Pomace oil is not used as that is chemically extracted oil from the olive malaxed compound from which good oils have been extracted already . Pomace oil is inferior quality oil . A little better than Lampante quality which us not recommended for food use
2812 2018-02-26 18:18:52 ‘Today we are making a healthy meal!’

*dumps 1/2c oil to sauté veggies. 

‘This is healthy fat so don’t worry about it!’ 


2813 2018-02-26 18:18:47 
2814 2018-02-26 18:18:46 waste of money, stop subsidizing businesses and the oil industry with taxpayers money
2815 2018-02-26 18:18:45 So, the NRA is responsible for the shooting, is the Department of Education responsible for the lack of STEM programs? Can I boycott my taxes?
2816 2018-02-26 18:18:02 Kochs have always been selective straw men for left, issue dependant. Don't expect much of a push on left here to tell us how evil they are
2817 2018-02-26 18:17:58 climate skeptics rep a tiny fraction of scientists. they don't represent anyone but oil & gas, if that label was properly displayed, I'll listen. do you draw the line at being friends with nazis? civilized people do. why should fractional extremist outliers get outsized podiums?
2818 2018-02-26 18:17:58 wake up!  Tanner Lee couldn't hit the Golf of Mexico from an oil rig!  He's worse than Kyle Boller.
2819 2018-02-26 18:17:54 David Davis is the Oil from the Snake 
2820 2018-02-26 18:17:53 Yes on stock mkt, but not to degree of Venez or Zimbabwe...US econ is very different.  Inflate the price of stuff enough in USD terms & the US will soon be producing a lot of it & outcompeting the world.  Eg see shale oil (understanding mfg goods supply chains are more complex.)
2821 2018-02-26 18:17:27 The majority are engineers I would think, a mixture of citizens and expats. UAE and the  GCC have a big demand for all sorts of engineers specially these industries: real estate, infrastructure, and don’t forget the big one oil and any type of engineers needed for that industry.
2822 2018-02-26 18:17:13 my favorite part is all the wrong grammar and misspelled words. Can’t tell at this point if he’s really bad at English or if whoever is actually running his Twitter is trying to cover up the fact that it’s not him.
2823 2018-02-26 18:17:00 $wll why in the hell is this under 40 dollars . Do people know they sell oil and oil is going up . Seems like a easy game . Shit
2824 2018-02-26 18:16:50 I love that oil is organic and fair trade. Do you know whether they are cruelty free as well?

2828 2018-02-26 18:16:29 With oil? Was that in the bible? Save your children... extract oil, burn it, and walla, children saved. No planet to live on, but the children are saved. Sounds sensible to me

2831 2018-02-26 18:16:22 olive oil is the WD-40 of cooking
2832 2018-02-26 18:16:19 hmm except Germany, France they produce not much. May be the swiss makes watches. Take shipping construction out from Denmark, Finland is so so, Sweden has large some oil related money they don't have jobs. And jobs in China are getting a hit.
2833 2018-02-26 18:16:16 You're implying is wrong. And if what you say is true that you DO care about humans, then where the HELL were you while Obama and Hillary were destroying TWO nations over oil and gas contracts? As I recall, Bush got EVISCERATED for killing Muslims. Obama get's a pass?
2834 2018-02-26 18:16:08 @JamesOlley agree with your article  today and @TonyEvans92a.
Please point out City were built with oil money, Arsenal were not unless you include shirt and stadium  sponsorship.
2835 2018-02-26 18:16:07 Coconut and avocado oil work great too. I bought a miracle butter machine. Convenient device, a little expensive but worth it if into edibles

2844 2018-02-26 18:14:30 Time for an oil change in the new car - took it to the @LOF_Xpress across from my store - lots of the guys here are regulars so I’m happy to be returning the favor :) All of the guys are super nice and the service is AWESOME!!! Will definitely be bringing all of the cars here! – bij Lube Oil And Filter
2845 2018-02-26 18:14:25 So, you want to ban ALL shipping on the west coast? All recent spills have been fuel oil, and not crude.
2846 2018-02-26 18:14:21 I do
2847 2018-02-26 18:14:09 Oil threat: SPE renews call for investment in renewable energy | #Ameh News http://#amehnews.com/oil-threat-spe-renews-call-investment-renewable-energy/
2848 2018-02-26 18:14:09 It's a template for Corbyn's economic madness. Spending and corruption out of control, hounded out enterprise and bust when oil price fell. No doubt you are blaming Obama instead ?????
2849 2018-02-26 18:14:07 Ofc my car has an oil leak 
2850 2018-02-26 18:14:02 Also to take 6 hours after all just for an oil change? Hell no.
2851 2018-02-26 18:13:57 Thanks to the lovely people who decided to steal every last drop of oil from our tank over the weekend!! School will be open for registration tomorrow as usual and then transported to Ab K for lessons. Returning for end of day. Thanks for your understanding 
2852 2018-02-26 18:13:51 it’s my 2nd home - ate good, drank good, gambled, took a bike ride thru the garden district, danced all night, got some voodoo oil...the usual 
2853 2018-02-26 18:13:50 Chickpeas, olive oil, tahini, garlic, lemon, pickle juice, paprika and cumin... Yum!
2854 2018-02-26 18:13:47 And so it has been decided - with only 2 votes in favour, the motion to overturn the punishment has failed. 

The 12 point deduction imposed on Going For The 3rd  and Mes Que Un Club remains.

The FA thanks you.

2856 2018-02-26 18:13:24 You do understand wind power does nothing to offset oil consumption and it won’t keep mass shootings from occurring. That’s what the item for today is. Stay on topic. #MentalHealthReform is the answer.
Happy, well adjusted people don’t harm themselves or others.
2857 2018-02-26 18:13:21 So we buyin Safaree's nut oil , I mean coconut oil or nah?
2858 2018-02-26 18:13:16 Never going to firestone again. My dad asked for an oil change too and they said “come back on Tuesday.” But then another customer came in and asked for one and they took him. Wtf.

2863 2018-02-26 18:12:42 Bond markets have stabilized and even retraced to slightly lower yields. "Equities as inflation hedge" theme is materializing into another asset melt up imbalance. Oil & inflation still rising. Vol shriveling up. 

#Fed is engineering a behind the curve overshoot of dual mandate.
2864 2018-02-26 18:12:40 My husband worked in the oil patch in AB for over 40 years. We lived through the NEP in the 80’s but it’s a ghost town in Calgary now. Husband has no choice but do business south of the border thanks to NDP. #SadButTrue

2867 2018-02-26 18:12:13 Hey hey now grams of oil too I’ll slip em in there too lol
2868 2018-02-26 18:12:10 So now they turn to God rather than admit that they are wrong. Oil is God's gift to the GOP.
2869 2018-02-26 18:12:08 Thanks Graham. Personally I am all in favour of climate laws because we will run out of oil one day and climate laws force us to find alternatives. I am sure if we were never in the EU, the UK would have passed similar laws anyway. How much green tax do you pay?

How soon will palm oil grown on rainforest land cleared today be classed  as "sustainable"? How you audit this? How about palm oil in all the other products on your shelves?

2881 2018-02-26 18:10:54 I've had an all electric car (Nissan Leaf) for 3 yrs now.  No gasoline, no oil changes, no antifreeze, always starts, instant heat, super quiet and an 80 mile charge costs about $1.50.  Many new models get 120+ miles per charge. Why buy a gas gusler?
2882 2018-02-26 18:10:50 I like to top my pizza with fresh greens and olive oil

2890 2018-02-26 18:09:56 Put thieves or eucalyptus oil in a diffuser, that works wonders. Take up to 6000 mgs of Vitamin C and 50 mgs of zinc. That builds up your defences. I know you here this a lot but drink up to a gallon of water aday. That helps the lubrication of your lungs and thins out mucus
2891 2018-02-26 18:09:38 Where the oil drilling rig at? Coal mines? What, no mountaintop mining? What the hell is it worth to have all these resources and waste them so you can take pretty pictures? Come on. Drill baby, drill! (this message brought to you by sarcasm)

2896 2018-02-26 18:09:00 No fan of the NDP, but you can't really compare spending in American Shale vs. Canadian Oil sands with oil prices at these levels. Obviously capital will go to the more accessible, lower cost shale plays. #cdnpoli
2897 2018-02-26 18:08:34 I got synthetic. Checks out. Not sure what to do with nice animal hair ones... what do artists who use like oil on canvas use I wonder?

2907 2018-02-26 18:07:55 Yeah I still think that Eberle deal could end up being a win if he can get it going with the oil especially if he signs for super cheap.

2926 2018-02-26 18:05:12 I vote no to overturning the punishment because it sets a bad precedent.
2927 2018-02-26 18:05:11 Lmao son...that was that Texas oil
2928 2018-02-26 18:04:12 @colinmckerrache any leads on what that does to oil markets? Is the fraction that is now used for diesel going to be partly sold in other applications?

Also curious if diesel car owners are more likely to replace car with an EV.
2929 2018-02-26 18:04:11 Sorry all, if I stream today, it probably won't be until tonight. Have to go get an oil consumption test done on my car, in addition to getting two tired replaced and I still haven't found my keys. Yeah, not how I wanted to spend a three day weekend I booked off.

2965 2018-02-26 18:00:47 If you have a beard and you don't put beard oil in it after you shower, you're not living your best life
2966 2018-02-26 18:00:45 Lorenzo's Llamas, a remake of Lorenzo's Oil, but with an all llama cast.
2967 2018-02-26 18:00:45 *Big Oil slips the EPA a $20 bill* We’re going to do whatever the Fuck we want. *the EPA taking the $20 bill* You’re gonna do whatever the Fuck you want.
2968 2018-02-26 18:00:37 It most certainly is neither of those things. I support the Alberta oil sands because of @RachelNotley and the Climate Leadership Plan + industry support for GHG emissions reduction. Name me another heavy oil production jurisdiction with similar policies.
2969 2018-02-26 18:00:30 In reality, studies show that investments to spur renewable energy and boost energy efficiency generate far more jobs than oil and coal.
2970 2018-02-26 18:00:30 If you elect me president one of my first actions will be to ban Patchouli oil. McKee 2020.
2971 2018-02-26 18:00:25 We’ve had a full on sesh planned for like 3 month. Digs booked travel sorted etc! 2 of lads work on oil rigs and its looking doubtful they will make it back! If its not Wednesday fucking up its bleedin weather
2972 2018-02-26 18:00:18 I really like old sci-fi / fantasy books that are small in size and long in length, have old pages that you need to get your fingers to turn the page, with really nice artwork of characters and castes and old style, diverse characters on the front with oil painting shit

..  Climate Change..
2977 2018-02-26 17:59:32 We specify Vegan Leather as opposed to faux leather because this bag is produced with NO materials derived from animal products! Many faux leather bags are not true animal hide but still use animal byproducts (like oil) in their manufacturing.
2978 2018-02-26 17:59:28 (3/3) All decisions taken in this league are and have always been based on the will of the majority. That is regardless of who heads up the FA. 

On that note, my vote is NO to overturning the punishment.
2979 2018-02-26 17:59:20 Woah you can mix argan oil with aloe vera gel wow
I thought that argan oil is meant for your hair. I used my bro's which is meant specially for treating hair
2980 2018-02-26 17:59:16 U stabbed us in the Back Romney! Any one who stands with or behind this President stab's this country in the Back! Protected Federal Lands he open to Oil Rigging to line his own pockets! Dirty Energy in Coal, instead of wind/Sun! U follow him, an we unfollow u.
2981 2018-02-26 17:59:07 Why do the Arabs have the oil and The Irish  have the potato  
Irish had first Choice :-)

2983 2018-02-26 17:58:45 Biofuel: rapid growth plant matter processed into liquid fuel source aka premature oil.
Fossil fuel: ancient plant matter geologically crushed into liquid fuel source aka crude oil.
2984 2018-02-26 17:58:38 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!

2988 2018-02-26 17:58:15 Can the Mfgs. of resin miniature's terrain learn the definition of too much mold release agent. I swear I just opened a pack of weapons crates that feel like they've been soaked in baby oil.
2989 2018-02-26 17:58:12 I don’t understand the point of putting coconut oil in face products anymore. Yes, it works fine on some people but there are better options and allows it to be used by a larger range of folks.
2990 2018-02-26 17:58:09 This toracle frienship should soar on to the finals while we oil our voting wheels for Teddy A to win.

2991 2018-02-26 17:58:01 What annoys me more is these ‘beautiful’ people aren’t single but I am. I’m no oil painting admittedly but when I see people like that who aren’t, I do wonder what the hell is going on lol
2992 2018-02-26 17:58:00 It's probably better than my interpretation that it's a Republican holiday because it's all about how oil is a sustainable resource.
2993 2018-02-26 17:57:54 Crisis actor? Talk about the pot calling the kettle black. Have you no shame, you snake-oil-peddling fraud?
2994 2018-02-26 17:57:44 Also, the Iranians could simply send their own tanker truck to pick up the oil. Surely the IRGC has some connections in the trucking biz
2995 2018-02-26 17:57:44 I kid but he did rate Lucic’s 16/17 season as a 6/10 which I don’t think he has been better this year.
2996 2018-02-26 17:57:40 Hahaha! Fools, no oil is not healthy.
2997 2018-02-26 17:57:40 Oil does not create enough energy to make itself! These arguments' of yours are peurile and not impressing anybody!
2998 2018-02-26 17:57:35 Yay don't promote oil. Let's use our resources "Sunshine State" use the solar, wind and ocean power. Let's learn
2999 2018-02-26 17:57:09 These new cars are weird. I've officially owned the Fit for a year now and about to change the oil for only the second time.
3000 2018-02-26 17:57:02 Canada's oil and gas sector showing leadership on North American Competitiveness.
3001 2018-02-26 17:56:56 Oil made from the kernels of the argan tree... it’s from Morocco
3002 2018-02-26 17:56:43 Yeah dude and No its not a Rari but it is some stern quality German engineering that deserves a $90 oil change if youre a broke boy get a ford and be ugly
3003 2018-02-26 17:56:42 Listening to @rihanna while writing about oil and gas wells in the Mountain West = my life
3004 2018-02-26 17:56:29 #NP Neil And Adam @neiladammusic - Oil Fire on @Ultimate365R
3005 2018-02-26 17:56:27 I thought of that one, but then, countless thousands of trucks carrying fuel oil/crude have crossed from Iraq to Iran over the years w/out x-ray being an issue
3006 2018-02-26 17:56:26 Yes, but I think there was always a divide in CAPP between a few of the larger oil sands producers that back NDP plan, and rank-and-file.
3007 2018-02-26 17:56:23 Paying $20 for a $50 oil change 
3008 2018-02-26 17:56:04 Also use beard oil for that

3014 2018-02-26 17:55:40 Try eating a healthy fat before bed. Like coconut oil stirred into some chamomile tea. Could be your cortisol levels rising to raise your blood sugar.
3015 2018-02-26 17:55:39 I just get out in front and lay down oil
3016 2018-02-26 17:55:32 For better or worse, players did play themselves into jobs and contracts because of last year. Even if the effects are not all positive, they still exist
3017 2018-02-26 17:55:08 In HoA QP, @lorrainemichael says the Premier told the NOIA AGM he would like to see oil production doubled in next 12 years, a risky plan over which he has little to no control #nlpoli
3018 2018-02-26 17:55:01 I remember I wanted to use rose essential oil in a product until I saw how much a teeny bottle was. No ma’am
3019 2018-02-26 17:54:57 how high is oil yet to spike??
3020 2018-02-26 17:54:40 And if the contract coming back has a large signing bonus or is in the late years with a lower actual value. Katz might not be spending much more.
3021 2018-02-26 17:54:28 Who wants to try full spectrum CBD OIL RISK FREE?? 30 DAY MONEY BACK GUARANTEE!!
3022 2018-02-26 17:54:27 Great photo a couple of frirnds in Art Class at Blairgowrie have done oil paintings of this scene.
3023 2018-02-26 17:54:26 What should I put in my oil diffuser today :-)
3024 2018-02-26 17:54:21 It’s like “ GHANTA “ who cares until am getting my 100 bucks and night oil even if they speak Hebrew who cares. It’s same with any part of india.
3025 2018-02-26 17:54:17 Awh what the hell. Someone told me bleach  and I felt like that would just complicate things more... I have so much vegetable oil.
3026 2018-02-26 17:54:02 @Gidi_Traffic A militant group, Supreme Egbesu Council, has threatened to bomb oil facilities in Warri North, Warri South and South-West LGAs,of Delta State,should Governor Ifeanyi Okowa implement his proposed plan to share Ogbe-Ijoh land to Aladja community
3027 2018-02-26 17:54:00 I'm really disappointed at how u viewing this situation we are faced with. We CAN NOT let certain members and a failing administrator 2 bring this league down.
3028 2018-02-26 17:53:52 มีเบอร์ไหมครับ
3029 2018-02-26 17:53:52 I may underestimate that, but then if that's the case, I think Chia would be on collar sized leash. But I do think you could get some assets for nothing more than burning the useless capspace. And if the contracts are over Katz is only paying that salary for 2 months.
3030 2018-02-26 17:53:48 We are being gouged by the oil companies.
3031 2018-02-26 17:53:37 Y’all don’t sleep on black castor  oil that shit worksss wonders when growing out your eyebrows.
3032 2018-02-26 17:53:27 I need there to be like a waiter app but for like my car 
I need an oil change and my car detailed and it would be so convenient if they could do it while I’m on the clock.. you know?
3033 2018-02-26 17:53:27 ผมครับ
3034 2018-02-26 17:53:02 So, it's taken a couple years but I think i've *finally* made a near perfect bowl of matzo ball soup-- butter instead of oil and a bit of baking soda (the internet told me 2tsp but 1 seems better) for fluffy balls that aren't so fluffy they just turn to mush. Yay!
3035 2018-02-26 17:53:01 Interesting. Remember this? “We appreciate the strong leadership demonstrated by Premier Notley and her government. The framework announced will allow ongoing innovation and technology investment in the oil and natural gas sector. Murray Edwards, CNRL
3036 2018-02-26 17:52:44 Every time I try to get my oil changed everybody booked 
3037 2018-02-26 17:52:31 The amount doesn't even factor into it (though it is farcical).

They said it was a "bonus" when in fact the numbers for oil were integral (baked-in) to their basic financial model.

Obviously "bonus" doesn't mean to the SNP what it means to everyone else.
3038 2018-02-26 17:52:22 US Treasury Department issued a new round of sanctions that targeted #oil smugglers in #Libya. Six individuals sanctioned: Darin Dibono, Gordon DeBono, Rodrik Grish, Fahmi Ben Khalifa, Ahmed Ibrahim Hassan Ahmed Arafa and Terence Mikalaf
3039 2018-02-26 17:52:22 Isn’t that why people recommend gentle baby shampoo? Idk — I’m a savage heathen and use coconut oil mixed with facial cleanser.
3040 2018-02-26 17:52:17 I hope he has tons.  Maybe he should get something like  a WikiLeaks to publish them
3041 2018-02-26 17:52:05 They say "Oil Pulling" is good for health!!!
Now I see it's bad for #syria and it's people!!!

3043 2018-02-26 17:51:57 @GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @PRyan please tell us why you can’t do the same for the middle-class in the USA? Because you’re beholden to the energy and oil lobbies .... how much money do each of you take from these lobbies to screw us?
3044 2018-02-26 17:51:56 Sitting in the waiting area with tons of people while I get my oil changed.  I’m wearing capri pants and realized it’s been a few days since I’ve shaved.  There is no hiding that.

3047 2018-02-26 17:51:24 (2/3) Therefore, in a 6-member league, at least 4 votes will be required for the motion to pass. 

The floor is open for voting. 

The tally of votes currently stands at:

Yes - 2 (@tlotlo20_ , @zizi_oil2 )
No - 1 (@Wackowadibusa )
3048 2018-02-26 17:51:07 you mean instead of hacking someone's email and then laundering it thru Wikileaks or some other mechanism?  Oh.
3049 2018-02-26 17:50:50 In 2012, @IEA reported that Nigeria loses US$7 billion (N1.159 trillion: 2014) yearly to crude oil theft.
3050 2018-02-26 17:50:37 What’s argan oil ?
3051 2018-02-26 17:50:29 He was a big oil rigger from Aberdeen. But he did laugh when I replied so you never know 
3052 2018-02-26 17:50:25 I just washed my hair & put some in it & I smell black castor oil over my perfume

3054 2018-02-26 17:50:13 Utilities can replace oil companies as transportation power source. Big opportunity for them.
3055 2018-02-26 17:50:08 you seem really upset that Rohrabacher and others are exposed as Putin puppets.    Maybe stop tweeting and go have a private moment.  Also, #MuellerTime 
3056 2018-02-26 17:49:58 I proposed a committee. Why is the administrator overlooking that?!
3057 2018-02-26 17:49:57 Let’s fruits be eaten stick to oil will be both good for the body and the hair
3058 2018-02-26 17:49:38 Don't forget to ask about the Resnicks using oil wastewater to irrigate their crops, like Halos mandarins or Wonderful almonds and pistachios.
3059 2018-02-26 17:49:36 There is absolutely no problem with this league. I’d like to suggest a motion of further punishment against those attempting this coup
3060 2018-02-26 17:49:27 Whereas our strength, the THING that pays the BILLS is our OIL, like it or not. Drill baby DRILL!!! #cdnpoli #polcan #cpc #pcc #trudeaumustgo #trudeaufortreason #lpcfail

What is this productivity thing that's going on?
3070 2018-02-26 17:48:02 I'm at an Indian restaurant and I accidently rubbed chili oil in my eye.

This sucks.
3071 2018-02-26 17:47:59 Massage a few drops of coconut oil around the eyes to get rid off dark circles.
3072 2018-02-26 17:47:35 (1/3) The FA has noted the motion proposed by @tlotlo20_ and @zizi_oil2 and has the following to say;

As the 12 point punishment was decided upon by a MAJORITY vote by members of the league, it can only be overturned by a decision taken by a MAJORITY of members of the league.
3073 2018-02-26 17:47:23 I might add one of the world leaders in renewables Europe’s leading oil producer, uk’s largest food exporter, 60%of uk fishing fleet Scottish, so no we will stand our head held high on world stage than you very much
3074 2018-02-26 17:47:20 How about where would Man City be without the oil money?

Now WV says can't even fix potholes in state bc so broke just look at state rt 18 in west union oil and gas guys have destroyed our roads and told by state to drive careful we broke.

3079 2018-02-26 17:46:22 Shoot I bet in Wakanda  they have endless supplies of Black soap  Shea butter and coconut oil lol #InWakanda
3080 2018-02-26 17:46:19 If the quote is “every working person must have a voice”, then why aren’t they listening to the people who don’t want to pay?
3081 2018-02-26 17:46:04 someone told me once that the streets around LA do get like. considerably more slippery than most places when it rains tho. since it’s so irregular here, oil and dust tends to accumulate on the roads. when enough water gets dropped on that, it coalesces and creates a Hell Road
3082 2018-02-26 17:46:01 Limited time coz the new FA has to be voted in. The league is a mess at the moment. I repeat, the league CANNOT let an illegitimate FA presiding over our wonderful league gentlemen. New FA, new rules.
3083 2018-02-26 17:45:58 Not sure what kind of prospects you think they'd get but don't see it being a big win. Also, I believe you are underestimating the impact of another year with no playoff gates for the owner. He's paid a lot of money over the years to fix mistakes...I'm sure it grows tiresome.
3084 2018-02-26 17:45:50 i’m gonna try my cbd oil but i’ll let you know

3098 2018-02-26 17:44:00 Oh. I’ll ask in my oil circles. You also should try bergamot and grapefruit oils. Zing!

How you audit that for all the many products (not just own brand) you stock on your shelves?
3100 2018-02-26 17:43:54 I grab you by the handle and put you on the stove! 
I put on the heat and cover you in oil!

3105 2018-02-26 17:43:02 thank you! it was a former sugar car for a relation’s coworker, track only, so i’ll need better treads and wheel rotation after a bit anyways. monthly oil changes or seasonal? 1-months or ever 1000/5000 miles?
3106 2018-02-26 17:42:56 He’s so damaged. It’s incredible how people fell for this snake oil salesman.

3108 2018-02-26 17:42:15 What motion has passed?
3109 2018-02-26 17:42:08 Not a lot left to actually pay out in contract dollars. Katz doesn't seem to ever impose any spending limit and if you're getting near ready prospects in return it could be worth it.
3110 2018-02-26 17:42:06 And if either are a possibility, the GM would be crazy to not ensure at least one gets done.
3111 2018-02-26 17:41:49 Either cold brew with cream or bulletproof coffee - hot coffee with grass fed butter/ghee and MCT oil. Bulletproof coffee changed my freaking life (@Lindsography are you on the bulletproof train too?)
3112 2018-02-26 17:41:45 I erupted from my slumber, shouting "it's about sex!", and grasped for my quill and inkwell so I could scrawl this by the light of my oil lamp.
3113 2018-02-26 17:41:44 Mdrr le guide qui m’amène dans le desert m’appelle « olive oil »  et ça l’amuse
3114 2018-02-26 17:41:40 "You can cook anything without a single drop of oil with this pan!" I would rather die.
3115 2018-02-26 17:41:38 Many thanks for that! I didn't invent the C.I. Yield Curve, Mike Bodell did.
Seasonally adjusted oil price not part of the methodology--just spot WTI. I'll ask him about your question.
3116 2018-02-26 17:41:30  the only thing you have that is richer than our history is your oil. Small club tingz
3117 2018-02-26 17:41:29 You an Zizi are calling the FA to question because you don’t want to adhere to the punishment
3118 2018-02-26 17:41:23 Someone is using an essential oil diffuser. It's getting in my mouth.

3121 2018-02-26 17:40:58 Oil is not only source and can be phased out over time - nobody saying to stop 100% today! Fallacious argument! 
Infantile responses do not add to any sensible discussion, nor do paranoid conspiracy theories and political disinformation campaigns.
3122 2018-02-26 17:40:52 Ex oil US has a trade surplus with Canada
3123 2018-02-26 17:40:49 @McClellanOsc Hi, Tom. Your EuroDollar Chart says SP 500 will make new high in 2019, but your 10-year leading crude oil says SP 500 will reach the highest level in 2018. Would you like to share your reason why you prefer Euro Dollar more than 10-year leading crude oil?
3124 2018-02-26 17:40:47 I was thinking yesterday about trying to get an aromatherapy diffuser on a timer with, like, orange oil in it. But most of them require an extra ON button--they're not just electricity on/off.
3125 2018-02-26 17:40:46 It is! Not oily but more too sticky but it’s really good, I swear. Well at least on me  Other one, skin therapy oil is good too. But lagi prefer serum one sebab doesn’t have to deal with oily face thing
3126 2018-02-26 17:40:43 Why is there a time limit to this decision? The gameweek is only ending on Thursday. If anything your motion fails at nine because Sizwe vote doesn’t count because he didn’t vote
3127 2018-02-26 17:40:41 Good luck selling that to an owner who already spends a ton of money and has zero playoff dates on the schedule.
3128 2018-02-26 17:40:39 Because we demand to be heard! Seriously it’s a thing over here. Squeaky wheel gets the oil

3134 2018-02-26 17:39:49 43,452km (27,000 miles) of oil pipelines were constructed & given permits by Obama!  That's more than enough to circle the equator! Obama gave a speech at the Paris accord, about climate change, then went back to Washington DC and signed permits for big oil 2 drill n the Arctic!
3135 2018-02-26 17:39:47 Trying to follow 45’s train of thought, or lack thereof, is like trying to surf on an oil slick.
3136 2018-02-26 17:39:35 Regular oil changes should save a lot of heartache with ANY car. Keep an eye on your tire tread & get them rotated on a semi regular basis. Grats on the new whip!
3137 2018-02-26 17:39:24 Boy I hope I'm wrong about this: looked like that guy was putting a quart of oil into his radiatior...
3138 2018-02-26 17:39:12 City play the best football in the league but there is something just not likeable about them. And its not rival club hate. Just take a look at Leicester when they won. There was a geniune joy for them. Maybe its the oil money and they bought success

3144 2018-02-26 17:38:31 Honestly, I don't think anyone has issue w/ keeping Maroon at a reasonable number & term The problem is having both him and Lucic...and the latter close to unmovable.
3145 2018-02-26 17:38:30 Motion has passed. Meaning the FA cannot make judgements this week unfortunately.
3146 2018-02-26 17:38:30 Funny, Myers is a vocal supporter of Medicare For All, $15Now, stopping oil pipelines, just like Bernie does. The only reason you support her is you think Sanders is opposed to her.
3147 2018-02-26 17:38:17 that might be true, but the Oil aren't making it to the playoffs this year, and spending those assets don't make sense to me. to each his own 
3148 2018-02-26 17:38:13 I take three bottles of snake oil please.  What an imbecile.

3151 2018-02-26 17:37:47 I’m already voting NO
3152 2018-02-26 17:37:41 I'm sure Ray would happily produce an EG got to Lucas Oil DVD as well.
3153 2018-02-26 17:37:37 @Razer @TeamRazer any recommendations for getting a whole bunch of olive oil out of a 2014 blackwidow ultimate? I really hope its not a lost cause 
3154 2018-02-26 17:37:25 @SizweTwala has the deciding vote here. And if he doesn’t decide by 21:00 tonight. This week’s punishment CANNOT be passed as the FA is called into question. Only fair
3155 2018-02-26 17:37:10 There's problem,this hold up is at stand still fr over 20 mins
3156 2018-02-26 17:37:02 Yes, but be fair. DD's assumption of the moral high ground is based on the fact that he gives snake oil away free, he doesn't charge for it.
3157 2018-02-26 17:36:50 Working Smart are proud to be sponsoring APPEX 2018 & our Managing  Director, Deirdre O'Donnell, will be there tomorrow (Tuesday 27th  February). If you are looking for staff or consultants for your oil and gas  projects then do not hesitate to contact us to arrange a meeting.
3158 2018-02-26 17:36:46 Just watched some series on Saudi Arabia, cunt of a place , can’t understand why Britain is so pally with them  do they buy things off us and have oil over there or something?
3159 2018-02-26 17:36:40 So when the truth comes out and this idiot is impeached and/or jailed, are you gonna be big enough to admit you got hustled by a snake oil salesman? 
Or are you just gonna delete your account and start a new one?
3160 2018-02-26 17:36:25 Try this Faith menu Prof @pius_adesanmi.. Close ur Doors, Windows, Switch on ur Gas switches for twenty Seconds then light Matches, make sure ur phone is handy.. If u hear Boom, ur phone will ring and ur Oil Well license is handed over.
3161 2018-02-26 17:36:15 Hard to sight not having seen for myself but it could very well be chapped cos of the cold. Try bepanthen with a layer of oil on top (olive oil or any cooking oil will also do the trick) to trap in the moisture and hasten the skins recovery.
3162 2018-02-26 17:36:01 If he can take on expiring contracts from teams contending looking to clear space to buy it might work for.
3163 2018-02-26 17:35:52 It was a great move for both teams and kudos to Armstrong for pulling the trigger.
3164 2018-02-26 17:35:37 2017 oil demand growth  just put up highest YoY  number since 2010 and still stubborn bears think we are going to have a supply imbalance in 2018. Good luck with that #OOTT
3165 2018-02-26 17:35:31 Blair, not one drop of diluted bitumen is sold in local markets. It is all for export. Our local refineries cannot refine bitumen. Despite what the oil industry claims, Canada does not need an additional export pipeline. We need to #ActOnClimate
3166 2018-02-26 17:35:30 This is not happening, you guys are out voted 4 - 2. You want to capture the FA. No way. LEAD US @Sandile_Dos they must pay
3167 2018-02-26 17:35:17 We're forecast for late Tuesday into  Wednesday then through Thursday, and I have oil heating ... Hate it!!
3168 2018-02-26 17:34:57 WTI oil at $63.61/barrel, near unchanged.
3169 2018-02-26 17:34:49 I think we may have been oil robbed so I’ve got my neighbour coming to check it out!!
3170 2018-02-26 17:34:48 Breaks my heart 2 say this bt the FA has failed us. I think we need a stonger and precise leader. I'm tabling a motion of no confidence.
3171 2018-02-26 17:34:48 Evidentally Twitter is far more important while oil and gas continue to run roughshod through our state making millions and he refuses to capitalize on it

3174 2018-02-26 17:34:12 Two Q-tip ear FB removals in a week - how is it Q-Tips are not banned? A drop of olive oil keeps cerumen soft for the family doc to remove time to time.

3176 2018-02-26 17:34:05 I really want that to gaz and oil to be really national property
3177 2018-02-26 17:34:02 There is no such thing as roaring to the finish line when your season is already over.
3178 2018-02-26 17:33:59 Update: I traded out the salt lamp for an essential oil diffuser. Think I'm moving up in the world.
3179 2018-02-26 17:33:34 Well if they stop using machinery powered buy oil the greatest energy source ever,  it'll come to a complete stop.

So there's drought and famine there do to unbearable heat and no rain?

3187 2018-02-26 17:32:50 This guy approached me in the parking lot and told me "good luck paying $400 for an oil change on your BMW" first of all what the dealership doesn't even charge that much.
3188 2018-02-26 17:32:50 Leipsic is a little shit disturber with solid skill. Hard to play against. Watched him closely in the WinterHawks/Oil Kings Championship series. Adds forward depth and some upside. I'll always remember the "Lipstick" chants at Rexall

3190 2018-02-26 17:32:42 Canada losing oil & gas investment, and lack of pipelines is only part of the problem: CAPP report. Blames un-competitive taxes and reg burden, including climate policies.
3191 2018-02-26 17:32:39 I hate coming to get my oil changed alone

3193 2018-02-26 17:32:30 I think former President Umar Yar Adua assumed office at the time of global economic recession,oil prices were quite low. He,it was that reduced price of petrol because crude prices went south but he was not extraordinary,no he wasn't.
3194 2018-02-26 17:32:28 Woke up upset now having to deal with difficult people while getting my oil changed on a rainy day. Happy Monday !

3207 2018-02-26 17:31:14 Have you considered aromatherapy? Lavender oil, Frankincense and Cedar Wood can reduce panic and calm anxiety. Rub some on the inside of your dog's ears or the groin/belly. Rub some on your hands and pet Nero. You want to make sure it's in a carrier oil so it's not too strong.

3210 2018-02-26 17:30:52 Our nerves can only feel one type of sensation at a time, which is why we put ice on bruises etc. So, the sharp, cool sensation of the mint oil against your skin provides some relief from the headache or migraine. 
3211 2018-02-26 17:30:48 Everyone knows major transitions take time.  In the meantime, keep jobs in Canada, transport products that are less destructive, and develop the infrastructure for renewables.  Demand for oil will go down as the world is transitioning.
3212 2018-02-26 17:30:41 Yes, I feel that it could expand the opportunities. If we can obtain more oil in different areas, then hopefully it could lower prices a good amount.
3213 2018-02-26 17:30:22 Anyone know how to do an oil change ? 
3214 2018-02-26 17:30:20 I'd like to remind everyone that the U.S. is still supporting war crimes against Yemen and Flint, MI still doesn't have clean water. Oil companies are still raping our planet with millions of gallons of acid and our "leaders" are talking about anything else.

3218 2018-02-26 17:30:04 Oh, but you ARE sure that Hillary stole $140 million from her charity while leaving no paper trail. No, it's the Trump family that steals from their fake charities to buy oil paintings of themselves. If the conservative agenda can't be defended without lying, it is evil

3229 2018-02-26 17:28:33 If there was oil there or something of value bet it wouldn’t be left like it is. (Not stating facts but it seems a bit fishy)
3230 2018-02-26 17:28:26 That’s fine I’ll put some tea tree oil on it and it’ll be gone

3233 2018-02-26 17:27:46 How can an illegitimate FA charge clubs ? Doesn’t make sense. The FA must be dismissed with immediate effect. The FA has something to gain from these punishments. The league CANNOT let that happen.
3234 2018-02-26 17:27:40 Ladies get you man that atleast knows the basic about cars and how often to get your oil changed. That way both of you aren’t looking crazy when the car messes up
3235 2018-02-26 17:27:33 The price of oil in every currency would be a function of where gold was priced in every currency.  The US economy (which benefits from high priced oil), can have expensive oil by having expensive gold.  The EU & Chinese economies that need cheap oil can get it w/cheap gold...
3236 2018-02-26 17:27:28 The whole world is talking about relaxation in Korea,but Trump threw new oil on the fire with new sanctions.The world better could leave America alone and seek solutions in mutual contacts.

3240 2018-02-26 17:27:04 Siobhan Coady talks about the province's vision for oil and gas. Lorraine Michael says if she wanted visions she would go to the desert and talk to a hermit. #nlpoli
3241 2018-02-26 17:26:56 The usual retort of the present disposition is that all problems and failures are someone else’s fault  and the gains even when not of their making are quickly appropriated e.g. sharp fall in international oil prices claimed by PM as his contribution in bringing down inflation
3242 2018-02-26 17:26:50 I was wondering if you would pray for me find employment; I’m a safety professional in the oil and gas industry. I really need a job
3243 2018-02-26 17:26:46 Designing carbon pricing systems when other jurisdictions aren't pricing carbon is a tricky issue. Alberta addressed it with the OBAs, which are designed to protect the trade exposed oil industry.
3244 2018-02-26 17:26:41 True but Hartman isn't in line to get paid like Panarin and Terravainen was moved in order to help elevate other cap issues. Slightly different situation but I hear where you are coming from.
3245 2018-02-26 17:26:35 I CAN NOT with the comments under Safaree’s IG posts and on Twitter.  “Hey big head” , “So where do I buy your coconut oil!” , “Learning Jamaican dishes ASAP” , “I left my charger at your house, can I come get it?”  Y’all are too much! 
3246 2018-02-26 17:26:33 .@lorrainemichael says she is glad to see that this government has brought people together to envision a future oil and gas industry. Asks when are we going to get facts and figures on how these visions will be achieved? #nlpoli
3247 2018-02-26 17:26:15 lol, it's what the platform of the oil rig is called

3249 2018-02-26 17:26:02 Middlesex county was great to grow up in. Grew up in a town called Avenel that was a part of Woodbridge Township. We could walk or bike anywhere we wanted. One time in Sewaren one of the big oil tanks caught fire. That was pretty cool. Must have been late 90’s.
3250 2018-02-26 17:25:57 I assume you are talking about the wind turbines in and around Michigan. You know the ones that are leaking oil all over the grounds. Such clean energy huh?

3253 2018-02-26 17:25:42 I would recommend getting a few supplies every so often, as you can afford them. Hunt down mistints at Sherwin Williams (for latex paints).Michaels may have clearanced oil paint sometimes. Rebates r the bomb! try emailing suppliers about your interest! they might send you things!
3254 2018-02-26 17:25:11 someone always buys the snake oil—that's the case with any scam.
3255 2018-02-26 17:25:06 Also, the only way the last 20 games impact McLellan's future is if this group of players decides to quit and they have never shown signs of that being a thing...contrary to what many fans think.
3256 2018-02-26 17:25:02 Don’t you have a oil for that? 
3257 2018-02-26 17:25:02 Keep that Snake Oil away from me ! It goes down too easily and gets me in all kinds of trouble  #lovelystuff
3258 2018-02-26 17:25:01 The mental gymnastics it takes to get here. 
3259 2018-02-26 17:24:54 Conspiracy? You mean like OPEC and the petrodollar, where the supply of oil is artificially constricted to raise prices? I don't know much about that beyond the abstract, I just care about presenting an alternative hypothesis and some interesting loose ends.
3260 2018-02-26 17:24:36 Oil and Gas companies love when commentators focus on the taxes rather than their inflated gas prices... Makes sure their profits stay high and keeps consumer anger on the government rather than the oil and gas cartel.
3261 2018-02-26 17:24:34 Not entirely the same, but basin of boiling water, drop of oil in and a towel over your head should do the trick. Or airwick (assuming it's a brand in US) do the wax melters in various scents.
3262 2018-02-26 17:24:34 Living in poverty is not my idea. As such one has to use earth’s resources indeed: plants, fish, animals, oil, gas etc .. and that is what self-sustaining (real) nations do to provide for their citizens’ prosperity. Do first “nations” do that sufficiently? Why was England or ..
3263 2018-02-26 17:24:26 Feds already banned tankers off northern coast. $1.5B Ocean Protection Plan (not all on West Coast, though). WCMRC building $200MM response centre. Lots of fed legislation beefed up. Not sure what "people" want aside from a complete ban of oil tanker traffic.

3270 2018-02-26 17:23:26 I was reacting to you saying these games are meaningless to next year. Sure, maybe the points don't mean anything, but how can you separate individual players from the team success? If the team roars to the finish line and players find chemistry, etc, won't that affect next year?
3271 2018-02-26 17:23:22 So the price of oil drops hard. Btw, oil isn't money.
3272 2018-02-26 17:23:14 Thank you. I think more people would agree with me if they knew about the damaging effects of palm oil.
3273 2018-02-26 17:23:09 Hell yeah

3277 2018-02-26 17:22:27 Alberta just introduced a carbon levy/OBA system, plus methane emission regs, plus $440MM for oil sands emissions-reducing tech - all of which I strongly and publicly support. Ask Nigeria what it's doing to reduce heavy crude oil production emissions.
3278 2018-02-26 17:22:25 Factors affecting oil market
Libya output down by 0.1MBPD owing to disprution in El Field

Why do you change the oil in your car?
3281 2018-02-26 17:22:04 Have you tried CBD oil. It’s dear enough but It works for me.  You can get it in Holland and Barrett. Maybe try something like that before you go down thr prescription route.

3283 2018-02-26 17:21:37 no we aren't losing anything, we're still making money, just not making as much as was predicted so we aren't getting poorer, in fact OPEC oil price rises contributed to half the rise in inflation that had nothing to do with brexit

3286 2018-02-26 17:21:22 Don't think in USD terms, think in terms of real money...oil.  If EM's can agree that physical gold is worth 100 or 200 or 400 bbls of oil instead of 22 bbls (COMEX/NYMEX), this will help financial system smoothness tremendously.  Talk thru it, based on where the gold sits today.

3289 2018-02-26 17:20:57 Again, you are confusing two different things. At no point did I say there is no reason to play & said repeatedly players play to win every time they go on that ice. The original point was w/ regards to what they do down the stretch not mattering & won't carry into next season.
3290 2018-02-26 17:20:51 With Winnipeg and Boston finding their player pick-ups elsewhere, the market is narrowing for Patty. Hopefully the Oil can still see a good return.

3292 2018-02-26 17:20:36 I comb my lashes and coat them with vitamin e oil before bed. Vitamin e oil is pretty heavy, though I heard castor oil is even better
3293 2018-02-26 17:20:29 @GloWorld you are the worst network in Nigeria, in my hometown Dass LGA in Bauchi state we only have network for 2-3 days and we will spend like 2weeks without network, your constant excuses is their is no oil.

3296 2018-02-26 17:19:37 actually ISIS has blown up lots of turks i guess your media just doesn't cover it but you know even jihadists only blow up their allies some times, if they do it to often then Turkey would stop selling their oil
3297 2018-02-26 17:19:26 No one is arguing spills are inconsequential. But barges seem to inflict far more damage on West Coast marine eco-systems than oil tankers. Perhaps you should call for barges to be banned?

3303 2018-02-26 17:18:49 Doing a bit of research for my thesis ( it's on wheat/oil correlation, it's boring )

But came across this sentence and it made me laugh haha

"Last year, tens of thousands of Mexicans marched in protest against the rising price of tortillas"

#lol?
3304 2018-02-26 17:18:37 I fear some other country coming in and propping up their oil industry.
3305 2018-02-26 17:18:33 USA is on a fast downhill slide against all the other countries. Our miserable performance at the Olympics is showing the impact of taking the arts and sports out of schools, we'll soon be the only country relying on oil, craftsmen are few, shameful, really.
3306 2018-02-26 17:18:29 2 eggs, 8 slices bacon, fish oil, handful of olives, creatine, coffee, raw orange bell pepper, tablespoon of peanut butter - breakfast to OWN THE libs
3307 2018-02-26 17:18:27 You know that Saudi Arabia pumped massive amounts of excess oil into the system in order destroy the economies of competitors inc Venezuela by enforcing the price of oil to drop massively don’t you? And that the US has been waging an economic war on Venezuela for a good few yrs?
3308 2018-02-26 17:18:24 I used oil on my eyebrows when I accidentally cut it, it took months though.
3309 2018-02-26 17:18:23 I don’t agree with that, the FA has been more than examplary when it comes to matters of ill discipline. And whether or not the FA gets dissolved it must first deal with this week issues. We cannot have calls for change only when one is found guilty of something
3310 2018-02-26 17:18:22 Canadian heavy suffers from a differential because the current pipeline system to the US is severely constrained. The Asian discount is a myth. Politicians like @RachelNotley should stop using it. Oil is a fungible product, prices aren't magically higher somewhere else.
3311 2018-02-26 17:17:57 I think this government gave clearance to building ten new desi designed thorium based nuclear reactors. Once these are operational the railways which consume nearly 47% of the oil will be electrified and this will drive down imports and should reduce oil&gas prices in the future
3312 2018-02-26 17:17:53 I’m in love with tea tree oil
3313 2018-02-26 17:17:53 Thank you! Great tip! I add ten drops of cedarwood essential oil to the shampoo and it has helped my scalp (seborrheic dermatitis) so much. Also, now my hair is cleaner longer. Love this shampoo!

3316 2018-02-26 17:17:08 Ok, how would you propose raising the cost of oil when it costs roughly $8/bbl to produce in Saudi and Venezuela where they are sitting on oceans of easily acceible oil

3320 2018-02-26 17:16:44 Unfortunately, the highest concentration of oil you can legally get is 10mg/ml. It's a health Canada regulation, and I agree that it's nowhere near good enough.
3321 2018-02-26 17:16:41 Thank you, David. These are great ideas that ANY PARENT should support. These are forward thinking ideas - which show your great leadership skills. Special Interests have been fighting this for too long (Guns, oil, coal) - trying to keep the status quo. Out with old in with new!

3327 2018-02-26 17:15:53 Like what?  Name one.  Tea tree oil?  You need to understand what sepsis actually is, and right now, I really don't think you do.
3328 2018-02-26 17:15:34 Crude oil short here ? Has it topped
3329 2018-02-26 17:15:31 Are you sure of that? Who do you think control oil in Vzla? Do you think @BTCTN is a good and trustworthy source of info?
3330 2018-02-26 17:15:19 The Preds gave up a lot but Hartman is a damn good player and young. A nice return for the Blackhawks to be sure but am rather surprised they moved him.

3332 2018-02-26 17:15:05 i got oil in my hair
3333 2018-02-26 17:14:56 An oil spill from more tankers is not inevitable. In fact, it's highly unlikely. First Nation clam harvesters and Victoria already face existential threat from oil tankers and other marine shipping traffic. They appear to have adapted to that risk.
3334 2018-02-26 17:14:40 Not one person but MANY silent armies. Anointed, full of oil, unknown yet will be mightily used by the Lord for the end time harvest.

3336 2018-02-26 17:14:08 But the oil block is making money for her now. & the owners are suffering.
3337 2018-02-26 17:13:59 If you are against Repubs taking money from the NRA, then you must be against the Dems receiving money from Big Pharma, Health Care Insurance, Real Estate Developers, Oil & Gas, and Student Loan Collectors, who have put ppl into poverty, homelessness, illness&death. #NoExcuses.
3338 2018-02-26 17:13:50 What are your reasons ma @SophieEganM for cooking with olive oil instead of coconut oil?
3339 2018-02-26 17:13:49 An attack on #RINS is the new politically correct way to attack biofuels and agriculture in favor of oil companies.
3340 2018-02-26 17:13:44 And you did say 'Fans don't have to accept that but it's true." This is your opinion, not fact or truth. I don't think it is true. That is my opinion. There are still reasons to play.

3343 2018-02-26 17:13:35 Peak oil is not a thing.  We keep saying we're reaching peak oil but always find a new technology to unlock previously innacessible oil. Curbing demand is the only way to slow supply
3344 2018-02-26 17:13:23 Yes sir...the piece everyone seems to ignore.
3345 2018-02-26 17:13:13 You all know that this debate would be entirely different if we got at the root of many problems facing this nation and reasonable discussions regarding policy and national interests rather than competing private interests; oil, pharma, pesticides, guns...End Citizens United.

3349 2018-02-26 17:12:19 maybe it's just me but your titties are eminently fuckable with or without oil. Oil just adds sexy shineyness to them
3350 2018-02-26 17:12:05 But we agree that we have an illegitimate FA and it has to be dissolved. Call for an early election of a new FA. Can’t have an FA that is questioned by the clubs. It doesn’t look good on the league

3354 2018-02-26 17:11:52 Good recommendation, but I believe the Harlequin oil concentrate I have has a little THC (mostly CBD). There are CBD varieties that are legal everywhere. Check it out.

3357 2018-02-26 17:11:41 Article could clarify wether Horner was saying Claire Williams burns oil, or Claire Williams was being supplied with underpowered engines. I took it to mean engines, not oil, but that last bit about the other directive seemed like it was just there for the name drop.
3358 2018-02-26 17:11:39 Fasten your seatbelts, get ready for $OIL 55.55 it's gonna be wild. Just wait for confirmation on daily chart.
3359 2018-02-26 17:11:22 The coach's job is on the line. Players are playing for contracts or spots on the team, Connor is playing for the scoring title. There are reasons to play and try to find success. The biggest goal has been missed, but it doesn't eliminate all other goals.
3360 2018-02-26 17:11:19 The NRA is the people 5 million members strong. Thats what gives the NRA power. It's not like big Pharma or big Oil. The NRA has millions of voters behind them. NRA gave far less than most other lobby groups so don't act like the only reason congressman listen to the NRA is money
3361 2018-02-26 17:11:15 Slow down people!! The first rains make the roads EXTRA slippery. Oil floats on water... remember?
3362 2018-02-26 17:11:14 Don’t know if that’s entirely true. Correct me if I’m wrong but Permian wells decline fast, ie have to be replaced almost immediately. So less capital outlay for sure (less risk) but overall cost per bbl isn’t dramatically lower than the more efficient oil sands producers (eg SU)
3363 2018-02-26 17:11:08 The Cafe Mac Pizza for dinner today will be: moist crust with chunky motor oil and arugula.
3364 2018-02-26 17:11:00 Dead skin cells of the body can be removed by applying mixture of olive oil and salt. Replacing salt with granulated sugar can work too.
3365 2018-02-26 17:10:52 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
3366 2018-02-26 17:10:50 By that logic, stopping oil sands heavy crude production would simply encourage higher production in jurisdictions that are not de-carbonizing production processes. In effect handicapping the one industry that is actually tackling the issue and rewarding those that don't.
3367 2018-02-26 17:10:47 Good catch, with oil money, they can buy anything but not education.................
3368 2018-02-26 17:10:38 Dude you are a genius. Art adjusted for the x axis seasonality but not y variable. Hence, serial correlation. Art, would be great to see a seasonally adjusted oil price 
3369 2018-02-26 17:10:29 If watching a conspiracy video is all it takes to convince somebody of something preposterous it's too late. They'll fall for some snake oil sooner or later. Censoring conspiracy videos is just putting a bandaid over a hemorrhaging wound.

3372 2018-02-26 17:10:08 オススメデッキください #lov3 #lovfan
3373 2018-02-26 17:09:58 Better to refine the bitumen in Alberta; use as much as possible in Canada to help us transition to renewable energy. Safer to pipe the refined oil than bitumen. Better to refine existing sources, not keep increasing sources.
3374 2018-02-26 17:09:58 What a thicko you are. The USA have taken over Venezuela for their oil. When Chavez was alive the USA failed to unseat him because over  1 million people got him out of jail. Ask yourself how can such a rich country be in this mess.

3376 2018-02-26 17:09:46 Recommendations on oil diffusers... GO!
3377 2018-02-26 17:09:41 Those do look good! I mostly cook sweet potatoes by roasting in a hot oven with just salt, pepper, and olive oil, maybe some herbs towards the end.
3378 2018-02-26 17:09:33 $SN atleast we know that it is not going to fall...may rise very slowly. Earnings were optimistic with higher prices of oil in summer.
3379 2018-02-26 17:09:28 If you can get it through Quebec, then we in the Maritime’s would more than welcome Canadian produced oil... and send it around the world
3380 2018-02-26 17:09:19 @mattgoss would be able to help to highlight their plight informing of the consequences and repercussions of the use of #palm #oil and what those implications will mean if something isn't done. A shout out would be lovely if you would like to DM me and I can give you more details
3381 2018-02-26 17:09:16 In bikinis and olive oil...
3382 2018-02-26 17:09:16 u gotta use vegetable oil
3383 2018-02-26 17:08:58 This oil change must get done today even though it’s raining 
3384 2018-02-26 17:08:53 “Truth to power” lol I guess I’ve been missing all this “truth” that’s being spoken
3385 2018-02-26 17:08:49 When does Safaree’s coconut oil come out? I’m gonna buy it.
3386 2018-02-26 17:08:47 Then why don't you campaign against Nigerian heavy crude oil producers? Or Venezuela or Mexico or Saudi Arabia? None of them are de-carbonizing their heavy oil production. But you campaign against the one jurisdiction that is? That's counter to your own argument.

3388 2018-02-26 17:08:39 There’s a thread above.
Started with this:
After flying coast to coast for years on @VirginAmerica there r improvements to be made @AlaskaAir to be on par. 
1. Free screens shld be avail
2. Eliminate palm oil from all products - disappointed to see it in Pariners crackers.

3390 2018-02-26 17:08:12 Idk , head massages are great . But they put some weird-ass oil that has a disgusting smell . How should I know which ones oil free ??
3391 2018-02-26 17:08:08 I'd love to try this. I love argan oil 
3392 2018-02-26 17:07:58 Definitely not
3393 2018-02-26 17:07:45 Unlike oil mercenaires...
3394 2018-02-26 17:07:34 The team should get an even heavier fine for questioning the FA’s integrity
3395 2018-02-26 17:07:28 I'm not sorry about my racism. I'm tired of these people who have no respect for our nations and our people selling snake oil to our kids
3396 2018-02-26 17:07:20 Because dollar got some strength. Now it's losing it's power again, and 10Y yields are going UP UP UP... Central Banks try everything to prop the market up. Oil up +1%, OIH -0.3% LOL, liquidity ZERO. They don't know what to do now I assume... 
3397 2018-02-26 17:07:18 Aku dulu sebelum kenal haple pake olive oil as a sleeping mask. Gak ada reaksi negatif sih. Yg ada bikin kulit kenyal

3399 2018-02-26 17:06:41 Coconut oil
3400 2018-02-26 17:06:16 Flaxseed is rich in alpha-linolenic acid, an omega-3 fatty acid you can get only through food.   All the omega-3 and zero animal products. Who needs fish oil? Its bizarre to drink it.
3401 2018-02-26 17:06:07 I don’t support you either, at least not this season. We’ll see next year
3402 2018-02-26 17:05:53 But its only different for Alberta oil.  Other landlocked oil sells at regular prices because they sell to multiple markets.  Also stopping TMX only ensures that the world continues to use oil from nations like Venezuela and Saudi instead of Canada
3403 2018-02-26 17:05:50  dont forget the oil too
3404 2018-02-26 17:05:46 Arsenal lost to Arab oil money
3405 2018-02-26 17:05:36 Sudden craving to go back to my city by the sea. Sit by that banyan tree next to the five tiered stone lamp covered in shiny oil soot, and stare at the temple pond reflecting coconut palms swaying in the ocean breeze.
3406 2018-02-26 17:05:26 Definitely not Tlotlo and Zizi.
3407 2018-02-26 17:05:24 Oil producing country indeed. Lol

3410 2018-02-26 17:05:15 Yes! Like an oil painting. Amazing.
3411 2018-02-26 17:05:07 Can I dm u regarding coco oil plz?
3412 2018-02-26 17:04:55 You honestly don't understand the difference between shale oil and oil sands?

Or are you hoping other people do not?
3413 2018-02-26 17:04:49 I boil mine in a pan with dish soap and baby oil and it’s magical the grap that comes out when you squeeze them after.
3414 2018-02-26 17:04:47 Not you, I definitely don’t support you
3415 2018-02-26 17:04:46 Oh no....this will impact US illegal arms deals and oil deals...and somehow North Korea is dangerous who haven't done anything yet...
3416 2018-02-26 17:04:31 It's not! It's just Old Man Messiner in a Creature from the Black Lagoon get up because he discovered a hidden oil well behind the false wall that used to be a speakeasy!
3417 2018-02-26 17:04:24 Then as an activist you have done a very bad job convinced Canadians of the need to stop producing oil. Abacus polling data shows very clearly that Canadians back oil sands, pipelines as long as Ottawa policies speeding up energy transition. Gradual change, not rapid change.
3418 2018-02-26 17:04:17 اي والله
3419 2018-02-26 17:03:57 I need to put my car in the shop to get a oil change and new tires but I don’t even have the time
3420 2018-02-26 17:03:50 "Why are you ronnin?"
3421 2018-02-26 17:03:49 You white with olive oil 
3422 2018-02-26 17:03:49 Or, it could be that the much less capital intensive Permian Basin is attractive because it's easier to develop than an oil sands play in Alberta ... in an era of ~$50 oil, and all ...
3423 2018-02-26 17:03:46 BUY $ALB

3427 2018-02-26 17:03:26 Love to know how your going to handle your states severe addiction to Oil Revenue and the violence that causes the Earth and the citizens of your state.
3428 2018-02-26 17:03:26 They're drilling for oil down here,  it's pretty cool.
3429 2018-02-26 17:03:18 But isn't there a bigger conflict of interest when it comes to oil companies funding climate research? Who has the most to lose here - entrenched oil wealth or a bunch of scientists?
3430 2018-02-26 17:02:51 Thank you. We need Pruitt-- oil company shill out of any department that is supposedly protecting our environment.
3431 2018-02-26 17:02:41 lol why do some people oil their hair for like 30 minutes and then wash it out like it needs to be on for at least 3 hours
3432 2018-02-26 17:02:37 May Allahu ta'ala increase your willingness and commitment to Qur'an and the correct perception of Him....Aameen.... Wd40 is some good oil tho...
3433 2018-02-26 17:02:37 Mr. Conaway, if you don't see the "nexus" concerning Deutsche Bank and the RUSSIA investigation you have not been doing your homework. Also since you're an oil guy, I would suggest studying the NEXUS between Tillerson EXXON and  Igor Sechin and Rosneft.
3434 2018-02-26 17:02:29 mostly it's about peddling snake oil

3442 2018-02-26 17:01:11 Financial part doesn't matter as I said. The only thing matters is whether in 2 decades we can have affordable electronic cars or not replacing oil cars. That's the only end result I am concerned abt. Seeking anything else is useless in the big picture.

3450 2018-02-26 17:00:17 Imagine a Irving oil saying well, it’s maintenance time again(twice a year), time to dump the 20 Olympic sized swimming pools worth of raw bitumen into the ocean, no big deal we can’t do anything about it because we don’t want to spend money on holding tanks

3452 2018-02-26 16:59:58 Trying out frozen Brussels sprouts today. Roasting them with salt and olive oil, then gonna fry off onion and bacon to go with them.

3454 2018-02-26 16:59:52 I hope the first is beard oil  hope you doing good mate 
3455 2018-02-26 16:59:43 Buy the “no salt” ketchup, make a dip using olive oil mayo and pepper. It’s pretty good and not unhealthy
3456 2018-02-26 16:59:26 Farrah just ordered a #Fiix mechanic to come to their house for a Oil And Filter Change on their Land Rover!  #Downtown Toronto #Toronto #Tech
3457 2018-02-26 16:59:08 it also led to western oil corporations getting huge shares of Iraq oil--which many think that was the realobject of the Iraq war
3458 2018-02-26 16:59:04 discriminatory legislation, cuts to social programs, net neutrality repealed, higher admissions fees/downsizing of national parks, offshore oil and gas drilling in nearly all US coastal waters.

3461 2018-02-26 16:58:58 This should not surprise anyone....because of Venezuela's enormous oil reserves the government's about to be sabotaged.
3462 2018-02-26 16:58:52 Good idea. 10 barrels of heating oil for a signed Neil Gaiman?
3463 2018-02-26 16:58:34 In reality, all the artificiality is to cover her insecurities...just like Daddy Don the Con! Time for this Carnival Side Show to END! Let them take their oil on the road and sell it to their base for Kool aid...
3464 2018-02-26 16:58:30 Tea tree oil makes me anxious
3465 2018-02-26 16:58:26 What makes a person wake up in the morning and decide that they will fight to push the agendas of big oil? It’s like me going making my own sandwich board and advertising in front of a McDonald’s for free.
3466 2018-02-26 16:58:26 @_imDEEshxt Happens to the best of us. Did you get the oil changed yet?
3467 2018-02-26 16:58:09 thank you for the heads up namaste!  i've heard that cbd oil is a cure all for many ailments.  i'll check on the magnesium.  it was HARD getting off the ambien.

3469 2018-02-26 16:57:57 I think that’s a great idea! Register to vote and vote in people that are open to fuels besides oil.
3470 2018-02-26 16:57:41 - 10 minute oil change 
3471 2018-02-26 16:57:41 There is not an inherently different price between landlocked and tidewater oil.  Alberta oil sells at a discount due to having a single buyer.  Access to tide water will also increase the price that Alberta gets for oil going to US since they will no longer have a monopoly
3472 2018-02-26 16:57:28 Rubin lives on a planet where's she's a "conservative," so safe to say not this one.
3473 2018-02-26 16:57:15 I once gave my mom my car for two weeks while I was on vacation and she never checked the oil, so now I no longer have a functioning car

3476 2018-02-26 16:56:50 I have to figure out how to get an oil change before Wednesday night while working 9-9 everyday until then
3477 2018-02-26 16:56:39 “Common decency” and “Trump supporters” go together like oil and water.

3479 2018-02-26 16:56:29 "Regs" is an off-hand name for deregulation of such polluting resources as coal and oil.  Let's hurry to "de-reg" so my friends can make lots of $$$$ for our political coffers.

3486 2018-02-26 16:55:49 Someone's gotta stand up to Big Olive Oil
3487 2018-02-26 16:55:45 Usually making the sign would relate to you saying “ok”. Like you wouldn’t give a peace sign while discussing changing oil in your car, it’s just out of place and disconnected.

3490 2018-02-26 16:55:36 Its better than that we get the pleasure on saturday at 12 of turning englands electricity off every week because they do not gave capacity we do. Much rather be in wcotland. Our oil, fish, electricity . And we will be in europe if mood music correct. England is screwed.
3491 2018-02-26 16:55:31 I've a very vivid memory of me trying to cook french fries for the very first time in my pre-teen years. There arose 5 feet tall flame as I inserted the potato stick in the oil, nearly ended up burning the entire kitchen down lol. Never got to the point of tasting them

3494 2018-02-26 16:55:10 @realMarkCuban I predicted strong oil prices last year when the Saudi's announced a game changing "no longer exporting to USA".   I'm currently predicting a recession in Eurozone OR a TRADE WAR.  the euphoria in USA overlooks Trumps impact on ALL Partners [see nxt]

3497 2018-02-26 16:54:45 Bro, I honestly think your whataboutery approach to the palm oil boycott isn't helping. It seems selective to only boycott palm oil but it's still something, even though it has dangerous effects too. Humankind is very dependent on palm oil but also soybeans and livestock too.

3501 2018-02-26 16:54:03 your welcome! i did a lot of research & it brought me right to castor oil i've only been using it for a week & im seeing some results already!
3502 2018-02-26 16:53:56 I... really like painting my nails various shades of black with sparkles. Presently we are sporting Oil Slick with a Disco Ball top coat and Super Glitter on my middle finger. I want you to look at my hands and go blind.
3503 2018-02-26 16:53:39 I live on an island...traditionally we used a lot of cold pressed coconut oil for cooking...until the 80's when the bad press stepped in and we switched to soya and corn...now the research is showing the benefits of treating stroke and Alzheimer's patients with coconut oil
3504 2018-02-26 16:53:38 That's right, the country with more oil in the world but in the hands of criminales and terrorists.
3505 2018-02-26 16:53:33 OIL has lost momentum higher, out 29.43 +2, capital preservation here. 
NATGAS testing 20MA on 15min chart now, WATCH UGAZ pending ? 
GOLD holds 200MA barely on 15min chart as USD only dips on what is a very bullish run higher today and sooner than expected. GOLD lower pending.
3506 2018-02-26 16:53:24 I’m thinking more of the coconut oil component, although I understand it is saponified. Any insights?
3507 2018-02-26 16:53:13 Just needed oil.  As usual, most problems can be solved with the appropriate application of lube.
3508 2018-02-26 16:53:11 My car went in for an oil change and came out with a brake job 
3509 2018-02-26 16:53:09 @ThatKevinSmith Wishing you a speedy recovery.  Take the time to heal and spend time with your loved ones. Also,  I saw where they were putting cannabis oil in Pudding so you might want to check into that avenue LOL
3510 2018-02-26 16:53:04 I'm def not a dr but you should do some research on Magnesium and CBD oil. I have a hard time going to sleep, but once I do I'm actually rested
3511 2018-02-26 16:53:01 Yes, aware of that piece. A rare exception to the organization's general lack of interest in the NL oil sector, and only because a reporter bothered to ask.

3519 2018-02-26 16:52:08 The approach (& insulin sensitivity) for many 18 year olds who've grown up on high veg seed oil diets and lots of processed carbs, might be different than for a 45 year old. Unprocessed carbs might be fine for younger people but for many 'oldies', carbs need to be cut right back.

3530 2018-02-26 16:50:53 I think you will see upheaval all over the world. The dollar is the primary reserve currency & it is sliding which some think will lead to hyperinflation. The petrodollar is subject to lose its grip on oil. I think the banks have caused most of these problems led by the Fed & QE
3531 2018-02-26 16:50:50 Fake Olive oil. I eat healthy

3533 2018-02-26 16:50:32 its weird to think how people be taking cod liver oil, shark cartilage (and yes it's an actual thing), omega 3 fish oil and like animal collagens and gelatins to improve health...
3534 2018-02-26 16:50:29 @CRTvolunteers @CanalRiverTrust I've seen containers of waste oil sat precariously on the edges and roofs of numerous boats.  More provision needs to be made to help boaters dispose of things, otherwise it could lead to more dumping in future.
3535 2018-02-26 16:50:23 Isn't the jet plane like an oil tanker for the leaky gearboxes on the Chinook? Maybe it even carries spare gearboxes too??

3550 2018-02-26 16:48:46 Actually, we talk about it alot.
Big business is as likely as big gov to corrupt. Any large org (including religious) concentrates power which eventually gets abused.

The difference between corporations and government is it's easier to break up AT&T or Standard Oil.
3551 2018-02-26 16:48:46 Yes indeed!!! Cheese and coconut oil!!$

3557 2018-02-26 16:48:08 It might take a while to figure out how it's going to end up since the ends aren't great now. The oil is nice though! The base oils have a pleasant nutty scent once the essentials wear off and the shine lasts. I'll leave a review soon. :)

I'm satisfied
3571 2018-02-26 16:45:47 I doubt the North would support a referendum if resource control of the oil went to the new Biafra.  If the North were guaranteed resource control, at least partially, perhaps they would support a referendum.
3572 2018-02-26 16:45:43 Alright y'all. We gonna have to stop being mad @SheaMoisture. I used the mask & gel from the new Coconut Oil line last night. My knot out came out heavenly

3600 2018-02-26 16:42:10 Agree. I would only take the fact that several powers in the world, including China and Russia are actively trying to undermine the dollar hegemony in the oil sector by trading in Yuan instrad of the US dollar #hegemony

3604 2018-02-26 16:41:29 Because there already is enough oil and gas under production to take the world past two degrees. Assuming we can continue to produce is wishful thinking, bad planning and unethical in the climate era

3659 2018-02-26 16:32:32 IMF:
Increased inflation due to North Sea Oil - Feed through from OPEC production cuts and Barbour Boom
Pound becomes a petro-currency & increases in value
Overly Pessimistic forecasts by the Treasury
Gilts strike by the city
IMF loan not used and paid back in full before May79
3660 2018-02-26 16:32:31 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.

3662 2018-02-26 16:32:11 Oil..from olives..coal from burning embers..harvest the land..not destroy it..
He has his own bible..not the Hebrew Bible.
3663 2018-02-26 16:32:08 You have to *de*-oil (aka wipe) them constantly. All that sheen in their would be coats...
3664 2018-02-26 16:32:08 You can’t find any products that don’t have coconut oil in them now it’s literally so hard what about people who are allergic or it irritates their scalp?!!! That’s how u lot loose money you don’t cater to a range of people
3665 2018-02-26 16:32:00 Anita had requested in front of all to take her pictures to paint a portrait yet they kept quiet & you presume I had filmed to blackmail! Therefore please pay for 40 oil paintings. You know the price of each painting I had given in writing on your request. I still have evidences.
3666 2018-02-26 16:31:46 Had a mini heart attack after grabbing a frying pan and there was a roach on it.
Tried to drown it. It survived till I did an ambush attack with my fluffy slipper.
I washed the pan and forgot to dry it.
I put oil in it and I got an anxiety attack after the oil started popping.
3667 2018-02-26 16:31:45 Coconut oil ! It's time to snow.

3672 2018-02-26 16:31:26 Just incase you don't know

 The oil deposits which qualifies Anambra as an oil producing state actually belongs to Kogi.
Anambra State crossed into Kogi State borders to claim it. @GbengaGOLD @kogireports @KogiFacts
3673 2018-02-26 16:31:17 They do have a shit-ton of oil, though...
3674 2018-02-26 16:30:57 These look like they can do with a dash of olive oil or even butter. But then again, Bon Appétit

3676 2018-02-26 16:30:55 i think the funniest one was this girl sneaking hash through the airport in tokyo by having swallowed it but bc she forgot to remove the oil from the outside of the little plastic-wrapped bricks she swallowed that too and got a full on body high while in line for the checkpoint
3677 2018-02-26 16:30:47 Is have no problem sending my child into school with any left overs as far as I’m concerned I have nothing to hide about our eating habits at home. My only concern with Chinese would be if cooked using sesame oil because there is a child in his class that’s severely allergic.
3678 2018-02-26 16:30:28 Heard you were going to Indy with Ike for the Combine. Have fun! Lucas Oil Stadium has the world's fastest turf!
3679 2018-02-26 16:30:20 Bitumen pipelines like K-M and Energy East lose a lot of jobs in Alberta. You should be pushing for more local upgraders, and sell a value added product. We wouldn't need foreign oil if Alberta supplied our needs instead of shipping bitumen offshore.
3680 2018-02-26 16:30:19 So you have to oil them as well?

3684 2018-02-26 16:29:34 There's a tremendous amount of money and collaboration, between the U.S.  and their 51st STATE [ISRAEL] on off-shore gas and, oil exploration, in the Mediterranean Sea, just off the coast of LEBANON. But the gas pipeline from IRAN, will bring it much cheaper, to the coast. WAR!

3686 2018-02-26 16:29:32 Michael Gove is NOT to be trusted in any way.  Britons need to wake up to that fact.  The presentation is nearly always “authoritative”.  However, the substance is negligible and the lies are legion.  Snake oil salesman par excellence.
3687 2018-02-26 16:29:25 It’s only a growing concern because of shockingly poor and sensationalist reporting (scaremongering) like yours, and snake oil peddlers. Shame on you.
3688 2018-02-26 16:29:24 Over two day lead time to schedule an oil change? Come on @brakes_plus there are dozens of other places that can do it same day

3694 2018-02-26 16:27:45 Just arrived... 12 bottles of fabulous hemp oil with a 97% absorption rate. Arthritus? Insomnia? Anxiety? Give it a try.

3697 2018-02-26 16:27:30 Do they also believe it doesn't matter that the Oil Price has fallen below $100 a barrel since late 2014 and has done so ever since?  Mind you, it probably is $150 a barrel when extracted from the Flat Earth in their parallel universe.
3698 2018-02-26 16:27:25 i'm off the MCT oil like it's NZT oil

3708 2018-02-26 16:26:30 Know very little about this, but imagine it's oil from a plantation which is replaced / maintained, and forest not felled to make way for new palm trees. Not an area I know much about, sorry.

3719 2018-02-26 16:25:15 So why am I hearing that lumber is moving like crazy and that's why grain isn't getting cars?  You guys used the weather excuse a few years ago when oil was high priced and we all know grain was shorted equipment for oil shipments. Be honest.
3720 2018-02-26 16:25:01 The guys at the place I get my oil changed from are so nice 
3721 2018-02-26 16:24:54 Oil also just 3% below the cycle's high.

3733 2018-02-26 16:23:27 Why it take so long for an oil change tho I feel like I been in here since 950
3734 2018-02-26 16:23:23 Yeah nominal GDP means just one side of the story (Russia one of the top oil producer, 2nd weapons exporter and maker, 1st Wheat exporter, largest Country in the World, Nuclear Power,first drink world water reserve etc)
3735 2018-02-26 16:23:16 I use it as a replacement for oil as well.

3798 2018-02-26 16:16:05 Hi, Madeline, we recently changed the recipe and switched from butter to an oil brush. The burger is indeed vegan when you request it to be prepared vegan-style, but we'll look into it. It sounds like we may need to have a quick coaching refresher.

3837 2018-02-26 16:10:23 But for a tech to pick up,we need a straying point. Oil lobby wants to make it difficult. In such a climate if a private company as a starting point gets govt funding through alternate route then that should be least of my problems.

I relax every 3 months with @DarkandLovelySA then every 2/3 day, I use MPL/Amla Oil/hair food (mine is Morgans something - it's in a brown class bottle and the label is yellow).
I see better hair growth when I have my hair done
Hope this helps with your hair too 
3942 2018-02-26 15:59:51 That’s horrendous. If someone had been precious and hyper-directive about peanut oil because they had a food allergy would she have boasted about using peanuts? Cf that fairly recent curry case. Of course not. Vile.

3987 2018-02-26 15:55:33 Lol si huey. Picking up another application, doing an oil change, and then visiting my folks later.
3988 2018-02-26 15:55:32 What a bunch of rubes!  Still waiting, kinda like the tight, "waiting" to see Hillary indicted.  Thought it was futile to buy snake oil?  Bbbaaahhhhaaaa!
3989 2018-02-26 15:55:27 Use my oil lamps, the electricity will never be affordable and reliable. And you will probably die or goverment will ban it...
3990 2018-02-26 15:55:18 It is great when it works, and I really do think it should be legalised here for the pure oil.
3991 2018-02-26 15:55:14 This is Trumps plan, hes vested in China and Russia, look here look here all these shiny objects, while their running off for money grabs. Fools some are, in the end wont be the oil, it will be food and water.

4076 2018-02-26 15:45:08 Thank you, Jigar.  It's amazes me how efficiency is put on such a pedestal after we've used oil inefficiently for over a century.  Worse, the assertion isn't always true.  If you use heat assisted electrolysis and combined heat and power, the heat losses are avoided.
4077 2018-02-26 15:44:54 People want to ban CBD as a drug, but is an aspirin still an aspirin if it has less than 0.1% of salicylic acid in it. CBD is an oil that has extremely low THC in it, you wouldn't get stoned if you drank a litre of it. Although you might sleep very well.
4078 2018-02-26 15:44:34 Venezuelas government is as corrupt and incompetent as it gets. Sitting on the worlds largest oil reserves and the ppl are going hungry?  Socialism is for willful slaves. Hope the petro works out, it's sad the ppl suffer, but doubt it with socialism

4090 2018-02-26 15:43:05 True, but it isn't special. Apple & Google finance liberal causes (though Google is also in bed with the Oil industry), Hollywood corporations fund liberal causes. Any cause can have a lobbying group. Doesn't mean opposing political beliefs define who can mingle with each other.

4139 2018-02-26 15:37:30 I will settle this. Turkey never armed, trained, supported, bought oil from Daesh. Turkey and people of Turkey hate terrorist Israel state, Thug USA and IS! Turkey and US recognizes and supports Free Syria Army but US also arms terrorist PKK in Syria. That is what we are against.
4140 2018-02-26 15:37:28 No matter the question, the answer is always either to drink more water or add coconut oil.
4141 2018-02-26 15:37:28 i saw the video of the kid putting hotsauce on popcorn, i couldn't do that cause i hate messy food (atleast as a snack). but cooking popcorn with chili oil, or adding it to popcorn is a good thing and you should try it.

4150 2018-02-26 15:36:51 Whats your point? The REAL REASON why east oil imports exist is because Producers would not sign onto ship oil east, PLS SPEAK TO THE REAL REASON. Producers already COMMITTED to selling Canadian Production to US companies at stupidly low net back prices, and that is another story
4151 2018-02-26 15:36:49 You're more than entitled to your opinion, as off  the mark as it might be, but that is your choice. Again, discussion is a good thing...even it makes one comfortable. But hey, keep jumping to conclusions.
4152 2018-02-26 15:36:42 +3/ Meanwhile, the cost of such investments must be weighed against the use of the existing railways to (eg) export tankered oil. And chrome/ steel/ minerals from Norilsk. And food going the other way, to feed oil workers and miners.

4154 2018-02-26 15:36:15 This "Med" diet makes me giggle - basically its pretty much LCHF but getting round red meats & butter are evil  with fatty fish & olive oil. ALL diets that include real food are LOW CARB compared to the insane levels of carbs in SAD.
4155 2018-02-26 15:36:12 I expect to see major price swings at some point (volatility is the norm) Still, oil is a very “efficient” market: companies are able to mobilize resources if they see opportunity, actively study long term markets, & look to explore. Not many passive dummies in the oil industry
4156 2018-02-26 15:36:11 Blame the oil companies that are jacking up prices for no reason.
4157 2018-02-26 15:36:07 4,70,000 Syrian people and children died.Because of oil trade. Oil trade companies spoil the middle east countries for their trade.God only saves the Syrian people and children.

4160 2018-02-26 15:35:43 Ah, I see.

When I was growing up in a house with oil heat, we had a standing delivery, but in very cold winters, we might use it faster and end up in a situation similar to yours.

4221 2018-02-26 15:29:07 @ComicDaveSmith love the show! Thoughts on how free market can sometimes thwart innovation? Ex. would be oil industry buying up patents on engines that run off of alternative fuels.

4305 2018-02-26 15:21:30 Said it earlier, the results mean nothing from here on out, win or lose. Oilers aren't as bad as their record but are nowhere near as good as most think. Fans don't have to accept that but it's still true. Instead they question the players effort, which is as insulting as it gets

4361 2018-02-26 15:14:13 I need an oil change
4362 2018-02-26 15:13:58 With malnutrition and starvation becoming prevalent in Venezuela the labor jobs are taking a hit in production. The oil industry especially is struggling as workers are too weak to perform efficiently and accidents become more and more common on the job. #SquatVZLA

4367 2018-02-26 15:13:35 As soon as I saw Safaree dick I got ashy. What’s the link to his coconut oil? Is it a natural lubricant because I’m sure his bitches need help to take that thang whole
4368 2018-02-26 15:13:34 Hey @NutellaUSA, I really enjoy your product but can you please find a substitute for palm oil? Even though your palm oil is sourced from sustainable farms, the production of palm oil is ruining our planet’s ecosystems! Do better
4369 2018-02-26 15:13:24 For the ticks, try peppermint oil.   Then the coyote's can have both bacon and dessert with the peppermint
4370 2018-02-26 15:13:21 Leaving his young friend to the chores he had offered her he went to the stove, the right heat was now in play for his cooking. Placing his frying pan on the hot hob the oil sizzled and the chicken began to cook, he now had to make sure it didn't burn.

4400 2018-02-26 15:09:19 True. But you can't put a price on premium Alberta oil to protect your cars engine.
4401 2018-02-26 15:09:14 Given the timescales involved, all we have are theories. The inorganic theory implies that oil reservoirs renew themselves, but still beyond human lifetimes. It is just an interesting counterpoint to the mainstream, and it doesn't change much.

4517 2018-02-26 14:59:55 Simple, I'm a fan of the sport. Not everyone wants to watch sports & ignore what's happening but if some do, good for them. Funny thing is, the vast majority of the group that tend to turn a blind eye, are the ones who generally point to the players effort as the issue. So silly.

4616 2018-02-26 14:48:34 I usually rinse them, too and then I add a dab of dish washer to the stop so they "keep" their shape. Though, they don't stay pointy -_- maybe it's because I use acrylics or oil paint.

While Buffett is a genius, I would think that there are too many uncertainties in airlines (as compared to railroads), such as travel trends being more volatile and oil prices being roller coaster-ish.

[8]But to the Son he says, “Your throne, O God, endures forever and ever.     You rule with a scepter of justice.
[9]You love justice and hate evil.     Therefore, O God, your God has anointed you,     pouring out the oil of joy on you more than on anyone else.”

4657 2018-02-26 14:43:44 Capitalism consistently takes other people's stuff. Oil from deep in the bowels of the earth, clean air, clean water, human labor, old growth trees, the rainforest, on and on. It never pays what it is really worth and the wealth distributes towards the top.
4658 2018-02-26 14:43:37 Neguse is taking every dime offered to him from oil and gas. Boulder DA Stan Garnett is going to work for Brownstein, the same law firm that sued all the communities for @ColoradoOilGas. Foote and Jones’ friends just opened BoCo for drilling. Both reps are 100% silent on all

If Mourinho, expressed a decent political opinion, I wouldn’t expect him to answer about the subprime housing crisis or US oil interest in the Iraq war.
4669 2018-02-26 14:42:11 Your response is just muddled socialist thinking, trying to find equality where none exists.

A postman is not a water or gas pipe, still less an electricity cable.

Using your logic, there should only be one supplier of oil for domestic use, and a single wood supplier for stoves

4690 2018-02-26 14:39:44 The NRA doesn’t have to lobby to pass laws. They spend heir time fighting to protect our rights, whereas the oil lobby presses politicians to pass laws or get rid of certain regulations in order for them to make more money. The NRA is simply a spokesman for the people.
4691 2018-02-26 14:39:44 Yah, I love tumeric. Never had that combination. I am going to try that Insh`Allah. I usually massage my knee with peppermint essential oil. It has gotten much better. I do miss leg day :(

4704 2018-02-26 14:37:52 Good Morning! The difference seems to be in the ingredients. The body butter has additional ingredients such as avocado oil and green tea extracts just to name a few. Hope this helps. Cindy, QVC

4720 2018-02-26 14:35:55 No, ethanol is actually an important component in gasoline and is used instead of a cancer causing agent. What we don’t need is 10% ethanol because that is just a replacement for crude oil. I think with the will we can keep ethanol %s stable

4738 2018-02-26 14:33:28 My usual suggestions are those weird olbas/vicks oil nasal inhalers (the weird plastic tubes you actually stick in your nose) and plenty of spicy food. Steam inhalations for a few days also do wonders.

4792 2018-02-26 14:26:17 #GrowthNG @PaulAlaje @cenbank What concrete plans are in place to  generate foreign exchange earnings outside the scope of the oil sector particularly in the face of serious alternatives to the  oil sector  ? what plans are in place to the development of solid minerals ?

4794 2018-02-26 14:25:53 I could see China buying Venezuela’s Monopoly money, then putting the squeeze on them for oil at volumes & prices so reduced, China floods the markets with it & causes chaos. We really need to focus on energy independence.
4795 2018-02-26 14:25:52 Just go on Amazon or stop at a CVS and look for beard oil/wax. No need to make your own, there's plenty of quality pre made stuff out there

4803 2018-02-26 14:24:58 Nasa point na ako ng buhay ko na ibibigay ko nang kusang loob as oil reserves itong nasa mukha ko sa sobrang oily. Pota hahahaha
4804 2018-02-26 14:24:25 You don't need to have a super long beard to start using those things. The oil/wax takes care of the skin underneath, which means healthier and easier to tame beard hair. My beard is relatively short right now and I still use oil. Get yourself some product and go nuts
4805 2018-02-26 14:24:18 Keep your eyes on China & Venezuela too. Once China solves the riddle of transporting oil, big economic shifts worldwide. Currently it’s Panama Canal or sail around South America. Watch China for pipeline investment in SA plus renewable energy tech.
4806 2018-02-26 14:24:13 I almost burned my pan trying to make breakfast and also probably clogged my arteries by accidentally pouring an extra cup of oil in there but like its fine
4807 2018-02-26 14:24:05 Environmental activism ,misinformation,fear mongering the list goes on. Canada has the largest source of Synthetic capable oil the in the Oilsands  70% of it. Russia has the other 30% in Kazakhstan. Synthetic oils are the only ones that can be recycled to original viscosity

4875 2018-02-26 14:14:23 There are a lot of people still invested in coal and Big Oil. They see solar and wind and hydro as competition that is going to kill their businesses. Truly they already are killing coal. Coal has actually declined faster under Trump. The future is in Renewables.

4886 2018-02-26 14:12:45 In 1858, before Standard Oil was founded, lighting a home required whale oil, which cost up to $3 a gallon, putting illumination out of reach for all but the wealthiest of households. By 1885, after Standard Oil figured out how to refine kerosene, it cost just 8 cents a gallon...
4887 2018-02-26 14:12:39 In fairness, they said it was from a drug dealer. I saw another post that had maintenance fees: $2000: oil change, $4000: spark plug, $12,000 E-gear clutch. Not sure if it was made up, but sounds about right.

5017 2018-02-26 14:01:45 The thing about fried food is that if you use lard or animal fat, it IS healthier. Using vegetable oil is actually really harmful to your body. Look it up.

5021 2018-02-26 14:01:33 Give him credit. It takes one snake oil salesman to know another one when he sees one! 
5022 2018-02-26 14:01:28 Right, cos the resource curse is broad. 

Oil and mineral wealth can curb demand for low-skilled labour, so suppress job creation [indeed income inequality has risen in these SSA countries]

Or it can affect exchange rates [but Wakanda dont trade so this isn't a thing here].
5023 2018-02-26 14:01:22 Is cheese an added fat? Is the oil a French fry is friend in an added fat? Obviously butter on bread is, dressing in salad, mayo, etc.
5024 2018-02-26 14:01:19 Also, if it's an air-popper, then it's healthy-ish.     More so than an oil popper at least

5056 2018-02-26 13:58:38 Keep your eyes on China & Venezuela too. Once China solves the riddle of transporting oil, big economic shifts worldwide. Currently it’s Panama Canal or sail around South America. Watch China for pipeline investment in SA plus renewable energy tech.

5093 2018-02-26 13:55:38 Yes. Here are my quick thoughts. Mads, Eva, Jeffrey & Mikael are great. I could lose Price. Would have liked to see the brother and kid survive or last longer. Thought the oil plot was tired and unnecessary. But a change from evil railroad or rancher was good. 1/

5115 2018-02-26 13:53:59 You bring up organic chemistry done in a lab as proof of oil as having organic origin. I say you can make practically anything with chemistry in a lab. Plus, they didn't make crude oil, they made an organic molecule slurry with some hydrocarbons to refine out.
5116 2018-02-26 13:53:46 i used to use one pretty regularly but i think my face just hates oil unless it’s for cleansing
5117 2018-02-26 13:53:27 Keep some good fats in your diet. Almonds, walnuts, olive oil, and avocado.
5118 2018-02-26 13:53:18 Do you still expect oil to drop to $57? Looks fundamentals and sentiments have both reversed to the bullish side.

5217 2018-02-26 13:40:44 As long as the MIC (and Big Oil) is making money, awarded defense contracts to "protect America" from those guys wearing the black hats, we can go around shopping with our heroic white hats spurring the economy, never mind our failed humanity! The Trump admin. remains irrelevant.

5226 2018-02-26 13:39:47 Are we not a Constitutional Republic? Apparently, politicians are forgetting this. Not only are they caving into pressure from gun control fanatics, they are giving them preferential treatment to oil their squeaky wheel. All theatrics. It will not save lives. #2A
5227 2018-02-26 13:39:47 Methane and natural gasses are compressed in suspension with other hydrocarbons as they are just shorter, less complex hydrocarbons. It IS a component in crude oil, just the easiest one to refine out as it releases at standard atmosphere, like bubbles in soda.

5235 2018-02-26 13:38:38 I personally believe distributism is the answer for Venezuela the people could form co-ops and would own the oil assets. Putin owns them right now but they could pay taxes to the government and royalties to Putin.

5250 2018-02-26 13:37:26 The Apostles during their times didn't anoint with oil those who will be commissioned for God's work, instead, they just place their hands on those persons and pray for them.
5251 2018-02-26 13:37:24 It's been laid out by "Clinton Cash". National leader meets with Clintons. Clintons receive a speaking fee and a donation to their foundation. National leader gets access to gold mines, uranium plots, or oil pipelines.
5252 2018-02-26 13:37:20 Given eco/financial linkages between Cda & US and  mkt pricing of Fed/BoC basically identically...seems like CAD is one of the low-risk vehicles to support a bullish USD view at this juncture imho. Unless you have a really strong view on oil (I don't really)
5253 2018-02-26 13:37:15 I love all the excuses oil companies give for fluctuating gas prices.

5330 2018-02-26 13:29:16 Light tight oil in the Permian is cheaper, but the oil sands are competitive with the Bakken, Eagle Ford. And don't forget that US shale producers have been kept afloat by Wall St for years and are only now starting to focus on returns instead of expansion.
5331 2018-02-26 13:29:12 There are nuances in the consequences though and most of those were glossed over by Gove etc pre-June 2016. It was a case of hucksters selling snake oil. But you can't gloss over them AFTER the referendum. The details matter.

5359 2018-02-26 13:24:22 I can't help but think in metaphors -
someone tells me he still has a little bit of heating oil in his tank and it takes me a while to catch on to the fact that he means genuine oil in a real tank.

5455 2018-02-26 13:09:03 Worth noting that we shouldn't pre-empt here. I've just read that Guardian article, and it's BP saying that decrease in plastic demand will hit crude oil.

Your product does not specify at all if it has any similarity to Ricky Simpson Cannabis oil. Because your product seem to be devoid of any THC which may have curative effects.

If solar is so fabulous, they should rely on the competitive market to grow rather than sucking off federal subsidies. #MondayMotivation

5548 2018-02-26 12:53:00 Never use oil as the only source of moisture since oils do moisturise but do not nourish the skin
Remove makeup before flight, use face sheet masks, hand moisturiser, lip balm, and something to moisturise your nose since mine tends to get blocked

5562 2018-02-26 12:50:11 Your opinion is wasted, Donald.  If you claimed the sun is our sourse of light, the world would doubt you. You are nothing but an immoral, lying snake oil salesman.
5563 2018-02-26 12:50:09 Of course they do. Anything to stop #American Oil & Gas industry from bringing their products to the world energy markets.

5632 2018-02-26 12:38:14 Nothing strange about all that. Is it not oil business? You’re making it sound as if taking risks on frontiers is something unheard of when it is in fact sore to the business. That’s what they do - if the price is right they will go pre-salt even

5635 2018-02-26 12:37:58 Obj tried to do the same thing remember to them. By saying after you had found oil you had to give it up to the Govt.

Others folded. They did not.
5636 2018-02-26 12:37:45 Yeah, anti-d, blood pressure, multi-v and fish oil at night, 2 x 2 different painkillers plus an anti-reflux for pain dosages. Which is mostly just for start of working day, so I can think enough to take calls. I mostly just suck it up when I'm not a work

5641 2018-02-26 12:37:02 And yes, the others took the easy way out by lifting oil (which if memory serves) was the real reason you wanted a block.

They found a partner that developed the block

why? 

Beacause at that time. Only them and Snepco had the balls.

These were Nigeria's most expensive fields to develop.

Remember NOBODY knew if there was oil. You could only find out after you spent 100M.

They got Texaco to do this while others sat on their hands.

5687 2018-02-26 12:31:19 Payment of taxes is a fundamental requirement for our growth story. Nigeria has a very poor scorecard in tax payment. When oil came, we abandoned the old systems of tax collection that provided most of our infrastructure since colonial days.

5773 2018-02-26 12:17:39 I told you I don’t pay attention to oil companies. When there is credible evidence ACC is drastically wrong honest scientists will desert the tbeory. For 9 years I have been told by people like you thos was about to happen. I am not holding my breath.

5834 2018-02-26 12:05:23 I was part of the wind business - the oil companies were the ones pushing the scam. They had dozens of people whose job was to get the public and politicians to go along with the scam.

All aided an abetted by Green nutters like you. There was no one willing to tell the truth.
5835 2018-02-26 12:05:09 ...all of which will likely contain the aforementioned corn syrup and/or palm oil.
None of which is an argument against Brexit - just something to be aware of.

5867 2018-02-26 11:59:15 if the supply of oil is reduced the price shoots up. if the price of oil increases the price goes down. same with anything, including labour. flood the country with low skilled labour and wages will fall. reduce and wages go up as demonstrated in the original tweet. page 1 stuff
5868 2018-02-26 11:59:10 Trump green lighted Putins Control in Syria. Russia touted its roll as peacekeeper. It is clear Putins motives are oil because U.S. sanctions from Obama hurt him, so after oil. U.S. troops are attacked for getting close to truth. Russian plains strife our planes, troops attacked!
5869 2018-02-26 11:59:05 Very few products without corn syrup and palm oil. 
Slightly tangential but American recipes shared online bemuse me. It seems few Americans cook anything starting from scratch ingredients. There always seems to be some branded or processed product like "Bisquik" or "cake mix".

5872 2018-02-26 11:58:11 A currency indexed to the price of oil represents a significant advance on the meaning and function of money.
What happens if, for example, Rothschild buys all petros with his pocket money? Can this cause the course to flare up?
5873 2018-02-26 11:58:05 Why not? There are many valid reasons for a gender pay gap. You don't want a gender pay gap? Go work in the mines or on oil rigs or become engineers or work in IT.

5877 2018-02-26 11:57:07 I am not the one that believes oil companies are part of a conspiracy to promote ACC. Could you source that $100 million assertion? And for god sakes TRY to avoid Heller
5878 2018-02-26 11:57:03 But they are being more responsible than the wholly fanciful approach of the Tory extremists. You lot want to turn the UK into a giant laboratory for marketisation that will damage the UK. Your snake oil is far worse than their's. Your's reckless.

The fortune 500 oil companies have misconceived a tender without taking ground reality and intimated to stake holders that what would be impact of tender if the pattern is changed. this is gross violation of Article 19 of the constitution which guarantee the citizen of india.

6095 2018-02-26 11:17:25 It's a tough environment in the oil and gas industry, but Holland's stainless steel #nameplates are manufactured to last.
6096 2018-02-26 11:17:19 I don't think it would shock anyone that BIG OIL is working to make money.

Yes you somehow believe that's a conspiracy! LOL!
6097 2018-02-26 11:17:10 We have been lead to believe Russia was the giant threat. This appears to be a bold move for the world, especially the US as they own much of our debt.

China has also been stockpiling gold. Attempted to undermine the USD by going in on SA oil. The need has been scant.

6104 2018-02-26 11:15:28 The NRA is consistently ranked as one of the top most powerful lobbying groups in DC-along with AARP, big pharma and big oil. Look at any publications ranking system-conservative, liberal and it will be up there at the top. Gun manufacturers are a wealthy lot.

6106 2018-02-26 11:15:20 They have oil, too. That’s surprising.
6107 2018-02-26 11:15:20 Read it again. The oil shop has sailed. UK (inc Scotland) wasted the oil money of benefits. Created a culture of “entitlement” no point crying now. It’s gone. Big money can’t be claimed by Scotland now.

6222 2018-02-26 10:53:45 What, in Scotland, has Scotland's Oil wealth been spent on? Are you really saying that the fiscal transfer has been over $trn to make up for our supposed  shortfall. Esp since the period 'deficit' in fiscal transfer is significantly less than the years of Oil production.

6243 2018-02-26 10:48:34 It wasn't a subsidy. It was for investment much like the billions thrown at Hinkley. Once power starts being generated the costs fall. Being beholden to foreign supplies doesn't guarantee low costs. You need to be reminded of the 1970s oil crisis. Fossil fuels are unsustainable

6263 2018-02-26 10:43:44 Yeah the 5% VAT introduced this year has made goods & services relatively expensive. Diminishing oil
6264 2018-02-26 10:43:38 With India pledging $1billion loan to Mongolia to build oil pipelines & the only in country oil refinery - starting construction in Q2 .. it's obvious that there is lots of interest in this potentially huge frontier. #MATD have a front row seat & offers a JV partner a good entry

6271 2018-02-26 10:42:26 Or the oil version! My mum used to use the oil and it's one of my most favourite smells in the whole world.
6272 2018-02-26 10:42:00 The big companies pushing the global warming scam were oil companies. The reason was because higher energy prices fed directly into their bottom line.

Why would they want the truth to be known - that energy prices should be a lot lower?

6299 2018-02-26 10:34:41 As prevention: Echinacea tincture. Echinaforce by Vogel is reliable. Go only for pure oral drops. The best immunity booster for me is sleep. 7-8 hours sleep per night and you'll be unstoppable. If sick, thyme infusion or oil is antimicrobial.

6418 2018-02-26 10:04:47 Thing is, Oil really does make a difference. Which is why Norway has billions in the kitty and is not up to its ears in debt.

6503 2018-02-26 09:52:00 Ever wondered what's responsible for olive oil's appearance? The variety, country of origin and harvesting conditions are primary factors that lend a pale yellow to dark green color to olive oil. These factors also determine how quickly the olive oil will solidify on freezing.

Well I’m not sure Russia will let you have that oil now...
6629 2018-02-26 09:26:34 This oil and gas should calm down now. I’m tired of education. Can’t you see it?
6630 2018-02-26 09:25:50 oh please the conservative sheep fall in line and take their talking points from Fox News, Breitbart, and GOP propaganda and bible thumping snake oil conmen as well as a strong sense of greed to not pay back into the system.

6635 2018-02-26 09:24:15 Not only do I not freak out when Oilers lose but I also don't get excited about two points that don't matter. It's all window dressing until next October. Hence why reading much of anything to what happens from here on it serves no real purpose.
6636 2018-02-26 09:23:41 I would say that this is why I have an electric lawnmower, but I had a petrol one previously and knew where to put the petrol and where to put the oil.
Still like the electric one though.

6643 2018-02-26 09:21:37 This has to be about the most transparent smokescreen launched by the thickest Tory in a not very bright bunch. For someone representing an area heavily reliant on oil and gas and the need for a diverse workforce, it beggars belief. Are you watching Thomson’s constituents?

if you though that this “democracy” has you elect people you are beyond naive. Money elects politicians and politicians follow agendas.
6663 2018-02-26 09:16:42 Those are very reasonable points. You cannot be asking for more money, when you have not accounted for the one you have already especially at a time when oil revenue was high.

Oil & gas? Not bringing much £,s in.

We have less than 5000 fishermen in Scotland.

7183 2018-02-26 07:33:28 Socialists selling snake oil is hardly news.
Corbyn's policy is to toxify Brexit, and then pin its failure upon the Tories. With Theresa May in power (or any other idiot remainer) it will succeed, and once in power, nothing will shift him - not even a pine box!

i like cooking it on medium-low heat in butter and a tad of oil very slowly and turning it every once in a while i prepare my other ingredients for the dish
season it while it cooks so that the butter soaks it up and it gets absorbed

7316 2018-02-26 07:07:38 this is a fictional/magic-realist take on the Osage oil murders (for nonfictional version see the recent "Killers of the Flower Moon")
7317 2018-02-26 07:07:28 The need for state governments to diversify their revenue base, i.e, IGR is long overdue. Government across all levels must look inwards and see to expand their revenue. The era of state govs go cap in hand every month to collect allocations is not sustainable. Oil won't last
7318 2018-02-26 07:07:19 We consume 3m barrels a day ..that means if something bad happens or imports breaks down we will left will no oil in just 13 days?
7319 2018-02-26 07:07:10 I put on chapstick every night before bed and put lotion and oil on my hands. That's not even the half of my night routine

7321 2018-02-26 07:06:58 Davis -  'Corbyn is selling snake oil'. A bit rich from the man who has overseen the UK's end of  the process for 19 months and has not yet thought to stock the shelves. #r4today
7322 2018-02-26 07:06:13 "The government will not pay in oil, obviously". No. Obviously not! Good spot 
7323 2018-02-26 07:05:42 Tariffs are imposed on foreign goods not domestic products. Are you aware that we already have 12,000 existing tariffs on foreign goods and products? Tariffs are imposed on countries that dump goods on our shores.
Let the markets decide was for coal and oil.
7324 2018-02-26 07:05:41 One of the most high-profile cases is that of Gerhard Schröder, the former chancellor of Germany. Last year, he became chairman of the board of Rosneft, Russia’s state-backed oil company, supplementing his generous government retirement package handsomely.

7329 2018-02-26 07:04:10 The following downside risks are not being priced into crude oil with hedge funds being 95.6% net long:

1) OPEC tears up cut agreements
2) USA production gets above 11 million by end of 2018
3) Russia production rises 
4) Venezuela production rises 
5) Dollar index rises

7341 2018-02-26 07:01:18 I mean, quite simply, when people talk about the best baseball players of all time Aaron's name hardly ever comes up, end of discussion. Mays, Ruth, Bonds, Williams. Clearly it should, the numbers, the longevity (I mean he hit 40 hrs at the age of 39, fyi Bonds hit 45 at 39).
7342 2018-02-26 07:01:18 I’ve read the bible. I didn’t see any mention of coal, oil, or gas “harvesting”. Saw lots of mentions of stealing, lying, coveting, false witness, but not coal, oil, and gas.
7343 2018-02-26 07:01:00 I just spent over an hour trying to fix our lawnmower because my wife put a liter of oil in the petrol tank, and then got angry at me for swearing “because it had a picture of a lawnmower on the oil container”

7381 2018-02-26 06:53:04 BP is hardly believable, especially after their oil rig exploded and leaked oil in the Gulf Of Mexico. The US steals oil from countries like Iraq?, that part of the reason they start wars in the Mideast. Canada needs to diversify and rely less on oil. #AlbertaWhine #cdnpoli

7453 2018-02-26 06:39:30 @Lucas_Oil you have saved me so much money! I’m a customer for life. Saved 400 when I had engine sludge and now when ck engine light came on with oil valve regulator needing to be changed, used your high performance and light off engine timing is better! Thanks!!!

7455 2018-02-26 06:39:10 I could not agree with you more Elianok10. Deprive us of pain medicines that work just so they can force pain patients on other snake oil treatments is sinister and depraved thinking.

7468 2018-02-26 06:37:31 So in Thailand, the concept of an “over easy” or “sunny side” egg is foreign. 

Thais cook eggs in a wok over high heat with plenty if oil, basically shallow frying. Id assume they covered these eggs to cook it a little closer to western style, that tends to steam the yolk

We can improve it if we manage to provide a small hygiene kit (tooth brush with paste/powder, bathing and washing soap, tongue cleaner, oil & comb ) to rural school children.

7629 2018-02-26 06:06:23 Oil is their main export, of course the economy would crash. But since they control the government, they hoard all the wealth, leaving the majority of the working-class to suffer. This has nothing to do with socialism, and everything to do with capitalism.

7692 2018-02-26 05:56:31 Thick blue or gray smoke is an indication of the vehicle burning oil, which means that oil is leaking into your engine's combustion chamber. It can also be caused by a faulty turbocharger or trouble in transmission of fluid.

7697 2018-02-26 05:55:55 Omg   my "research" on Pinterest says it's the best oil for your skin because it does NOT clog your pores like other oils but you have to use "cold-pressed, unrefined coconut oil" so maybe that's the key?

No only is @EPAScottPruitt ridiculously unpopular among the American people but I bet an accurate survey among Americans would show 99.8% (0.2 coal&oil exec) would say they disapprove of his @EPA agenda.

One rural county accounts for more than 80% of oil production statewide and 25% of gas.

Most baffling that the other 63 counties can’t pass laws giving local government the same opt-in land use authority over drilling as they have for wind, solar farms, or coal plants.

8035 2018-02-26 04:59:46 No problem girl!! Also if you’re looking for a good setting spray that helps with oil the nyx Mayte setting spray and the infallible pro Matte foundation are seriously amazing together! Lol
8036 2018-02-26 04:59:35 Shampoo with Castor oil in it be have my girl hair slick like an Otter back.
8037 2018-02-26 04:59:34 Nope. It's Canadian oil, a Canadian pipeline.
8038 2018-02-26 04:59:18 Water, sanitary pads, tampons, all unprocessed fresh fruit and vegetables, tinned fish, hand sanitiser, 1-ply toilet paper, dried lentils, edible palm oil, prescription medication.
8039 2018-02-26 04:58:57 we extract billions of barrels of oil that has taken thousands of years to accumulate within the carbon cycle, then we pollute the atmosphere while "refining" the oil, so that we can make plastic crap that we then discard into the oceans where it leeches toxins. people are stupid
8040 2018-02-26 04:58:57 Edsu you better get some cooking oil or something how you even apply
8041 2018-02-26 04:58:39 I have 0 respect for Ezekiel Lul Gatkuoth, how dare you come to Europeans begging for help, begging for them to control your oil after everything they done to your people, Sudan is a fucking mess, stupid people need to be obliterated!
8042 2018-02-26 04:58:16 @thataylaa any update on how the Seaberry oil is working for you?
8043 2018-02-26 04:57:58 About to go work on them oil rigs baybeeeee about to bring that bag home this year 
8044 2018-02-26 04:57:47 I love lavender oil! 
8045 2018-02-26 04:57:24 My hottest culinary takes:

1. Shallots are bullshit.

2. Asparagus should be served with olive oil and salt.

3. Bay leaf actually makes a notable difference and all these dudes who claim it does nothing are out of their goddamn minds.
8046 2018-02-26 04:57:22 If Safaree’s smart he’ll drop his coconut oil this week 
8047 2018-02-26 04:57:16 Myk gr ato baby oil ga ada?

8049 2018-02-26 04:56:36 There IS an easy fix for #climatechange, just stop burning fossil fuels.  Renewable energy is cheaper too.  The only reason the switch isn't happening faster is that oil companies are making so many trillions polluting the planet.
8050 2018-02-26 04:56:25 I walk around smelling like shea butter and wild growth oil on a daily .... oh well... my skin is glowing and my hair is thick!!!!
8051 2018-02-26 04:56:05 The foolish virgins vs. the wise. First, “foolish”  describes unbelievers in Scripture (1 Corinthians 1:18, 2:14) and wise believers (Proverbs 11:30, 1 Corinthians 2:15-16). Second, don’t add the oil to Scripture based on the type of lamp you think may need oil (Matthew 25:3).
8052 2018-02-26 04:56:04 “Nothing out there scares me, so maybe I’ll show the snow plows how it’s done.” - my oil painting teacher on if he’ll be late to campus tomorrow
8053 2018-02-26 04:56:00 LOL I PUT LOTA OF COCONUT OIL IN MY HAIR
8054 2018-02-26 04:55:49 Well I WAS trying to watch @crissles Drunk History episode BUT!!! 

News of Safaree coconut oil and Jamaican dick surfaced in video form! PAUSE 
8055 2018-02-26 04:55:47 I just used olive oil to remove eye shadow from my eyelids....what am I buying make up wipes for again? 
8056 2018-02-26 04:55:39 I’m playing no games!! Lmao bout to stock up on this here oil lol
8057 2018-02-26 04:55:33 Fellas. Nothing like putting body oil all over your body while slithering around the house naked to a playlist of 1990's EDM amirite?
8058 2018-02-26 04:55:23 i dnt like 2 give skincare advice bc i j have clear skin but sleeping in a thin raw honey + vitamin-e oil mask is 
8059 2018-02-26 04:55:12 rose essential oil, sage candles, and jams to get this mind right before the work week begins
8060 2018-02-26 04:55:08 I like the irony of the wind turbines watching over the graveyard. Energy fueled by the wind towering over death that is harvested to create energy.

Will zombies eventually turn into zombie oil...or will they stay in a perpetual state of decay?
8061 2018-02-26 04:54:43 That awkward moment when you’re at a party and you mention the environmental repercussions of fracking but you find out you’re talking to the host of the party and they work in the oil and gas industry. 
8062 2018-02-26 04:54:39 Since 1958 Venezuelan Political Elites were using the Oil income to enrich themselves & keeping the people in misery just in the way that the left doctrine demands because all the politic parties that have been goverment in Venezuela from that moment were and are left-winged
8063 2018-02-26 04:54:34 Try CBD oil. You will be amazed.
8064 2018-02-26 04:54:31 Great show 1st half. Missed 2nd half , sat radio doesn't work under loading bays at terminal.
Great @marklevinshow has wider audience. 
8065 2018-02-26 04:54:11 LP shit is all garbage but it is not entirely their fault.  Health Canada set stupid limits for max mg thc per ml of oil allowed.  It's stupid that you can take cannabis, vape it, cook that vaped cannabis into oil and have that oil be more potent than LP shit.
8066 2018-02-26 04:53:56 It's all the oil. Nostalgia confit.
8067 2018-02-26 04:53:46 you are lying Dana - but you are good at that.  
You represent gun manufacturers - just like the coal lobby or the oil lobby.  But much much worse.
8068 2018-02-26 04:53:40 This beeswax fused with essential oil  candle tho >
8069 2018-02-26 04:53:35 Couldn’t even put on my coco oil today b/c my skin probably would have started frying from this hot ass room omg!
8070 2018-02-26 04:53:22 พี่ยังไม่ได้บัตรเลยยยยย ใจเย็นเด้อ
8071 2018-02-26 04:53:18 The oil is owned by the government. Just like the media and the banks. Their people are literally starving.
8072 2018-02-26 04:52:45 ... now I’m promoting his coconut oil which is certified organic and non - GMO and is made from coconuts grown on various USDA-NOP, EU & Indian certified organic plantations in Lakshadweep group of islands, India.
8073 2018-02-26 04:52:43 Jake the snake oil salesman,feeding liberal lies.
8074 2018-02-26 04:52:27 ให้ออยเลยก็ได้ ไม่ต้องสุ่มหรอก555
8075 2018-02-26 04:52:18 Is this good for sensitive skin ? As far as moisturizer I only use coconut oil like once I wash my face and after I use witch hazel . I’ve been wanting to try something new.
8076 2018-02-26 04:52:08 i bought some bio oil for my face and i’m hoping for the best. like let’s hope this doesn’t break me out but i’m hoping it’ll help and get rid of acne scarring/discoloration  and my face is dry as hell rn so i need some oils
8077 2018-02-26 04:52:04 Why do I get the feeling you have not heard anything that  @AJWVictoriaBC and @ElizabethMay have been saying for years?  Albertans seem so paranoid about their oil that its almost impossible to have a reasonable discussion about options.
8078 2018-02-26 04:51:58 では真ん中とって4000㎞ごとで！油冷エンジンだから化学合成１００％をお財布次第でコマメに10-40から15-50が本来良いかと。個人的には夏と冬の年2回で良いんじゃない？（旅は換算してない）只それなりのOIL入れないとギアが入りづらく成ったりクラッチが切れなく成ったりするよね。
8079 2018-02-26 04:51:20 He need somebody to rub coconut oil on him 
8080 2018-02-26 04:51:08 If my future bf is reading this just know you have to take my car to get an oil change every time because I hate going and will not go to save my life lmaooo
8081 2018-02-26 04:51:01 I do my shopping mostly at Aldi, ribeye steak, skinless chicken breast, trout, lean pork, low fat milk, muesli, olive oil, low fat yogurt, cheese, veg, fruit amongst other things. All A1 and healthy eating. Customer buys what they want. Supermarkets cater for all.
8082 2018-02-26 04:50:54 The landscape, the abs, the coconut oil , the..everything ! Nicki what is you doing sus!?!
8083 2018-02-26 04:50:47 Spinach + grapeseed oil + lemon juice + salt n pep = salad. Oui?
8084 2018-02-26 04:50:31 Stopped enjoying it some time ago but still watch b/c this is the team I followed since I was a kid. That said, I stopped pretending nothing games mattered many a year ago.
8085 2018-02-26 04:50:31 French fries not all r one of the dangerous food in the world.  Old potatoes Nd re used edible oil makes u unhealthy.
8086 2018-02-26 04:50:21 Pruitt is just another POS appointed by Trump, the biggest POS of all. Appointing an oilman to oversee the environment won’t turn out well for the earth. Pruitt has sued EPA many times over oil crap in OK. Throw the bum out.
8087 2018-02-26 04:50:13 also if the fluid circulation is not enough oil may burn and stick leading to gradual catastrophe.
8088 2018-02-26 04:50:09 สาธุค่ะ555555
8089 2018-02-26 04:49:59 Oh and Nigeria is a major oil producer.

8091 2018-02-26 04:49:23 All the doctors answers to this are uniquely terrible smells that many people are missing out on! 
Mine was necrotizing fascitis. Could smell it from 40 feet away, was so bad one of the nurses almost passed out. We couldn't care for the pt until we wore masks with wintergreen oil
8092 2018-02-26 04:49:17 オイルはギトギトというイメージを拭い去ろうか。時にはサラサラし、時にはギトギト。オイルはいつだって君のそばにいるのさ。
8093 2018-02-26 04:49:13 lavender oil in my diffuser. lavender pillow spray. if i can't fall asleep i'm convinced i'm a vampire
8094 2018-02-26 04:49:12 Fenna buy all of safaree’s coconut oil!
8095 2018-02-26 04:49:06 Hi sis, sorry tanya. Awak pakai oil based cleanser jenama apa ye ? Elok tak?

8097 2018-02-26 04:48:47 I'll hear out any health arguments, but as far as taste there's no debate. Butter is delicious, red palm oil...tastes like old nuts.
8098 2018-02-26 04:48:09 American companies make solar panels. Many states have rebates for solar installation, there is no reason why we should be importing solar panels especially from Israel. The BP makes solar panels so do other oil interests. They know there is loads of money in it.
8099 2018-02-26 04:47:57 ขอสักสิทธิ์
8100 2018-02-26 04:47:56 Again, let's not confuse my original response to Beer's statement. What they do over the next month & a half, has no bearing on next season and b/c of It, these games don't matter. Players play to win everytime out but these results ultimately do not matter.
8101 2018-02-26 04:47:38 IMO they cannot be stopped. Question is how long can they be held off? Eventually a majority socialist voting block will arise. Always does
8102 2018-02-26 04:47:35 It's too much, we don't use hydrolic oil.
8103 2018-02-26 04:47:33 I shared a table with a retiree at a hole in the wall Chinese place this afternoon. He told them to hold the salt, oil, and msg. He explained that he didn’t want to get a stroke. One day that might be me explaining to a younger guy.
8104 2018-02-26 04:47:14 จะไปขอพร 555555
8105 2018-02-26 04:47:13 Are you sure fans are not simply rotating less because of the resistance? That does not necessarily mean they use less energy. I don`t think this will end well if you do not circulate the mineral oil (or by some other means) to cool it of as well.
8106 2018-02-26 04:46:55 เหมือนไปสังสรรค์เสร็จแล้วกลับมาชดใช้กรรมต่อ

8108 2018-02-26 04:46:44 Perfect timing! I was just about to check into the #Forty100 update! haha

8110 2018-02-26 04:46:12 Just got an oil diffuser and feeling hella zen about it
8111 2018-02-26 04:45:56 Oil was all over Texas. So they were the Houston Oilers. Tennessee Oilers makes no sense
8112 2018-02-26 04:45:50 When I don’t use beard oil/moisturizer my face feels so uncomfortable
8113 2018-02-26 04:45:49 it goes a lot with white privilege too! black People with dreads are seen as dirty and “smells like patchouli oil and weed”, and have faced ridicule and persecution for years.. among other things, obviously...

8116 2018-02-26 04:45:32 just started using drunk elephant and I am obsessed. Night serum and oil is amazing.
8117 2018-02-26 04:45:28 Why is no one asking @EPAScottPruitt about @tarcreeksuperfund or @senJamesInhofe or @devonoil or @oil/gasdonations or @coloradoweed or @hispacdonations or @firstclasstravel or @whyrusuchaprick
8118 2018-02-26 04:44:54 i just took my contacts out with tea tree oil on my fingers... ouch
8119 2018-02-26 04:44:49 Mine did the same thing. I would mess with the tension wheel. I’ve found that a tension of 5 works best with fur. Also I would unscrew the plate and see if there’s a build up of dust and small pieces of thread. Also I didn’t know this but you need to oil it too???
8120 2018-02-26 04:44:44 Well I discovered that *my* toddler can moisturize my entire outfit with the baby oil I put on her after her bath. 
8121 2018-02-26 04:44:31 This happened in Venezuela and now the oil workers are too poor and weak to work.  Nationalizing is a disaster.  It happened in SK with potash and the ndp almost expropriated the coop refinery in 1991.  You scare all investment away.
8122 2018-02-26 04:44:29 ok for like a quick breakfast I usually only do salt pepper lemon juice and olive oil, the complex ones I haven’t reallly made
8123 2018-02-26 04:44:27 brenda got me some more lip oil

8127 2018-02-26 04:43:12 You normally don't trust BP and want their business terminated. What has changed? Btw, main message was peak oil in 2040.
8128 2018-02-26 04:42:59 Vegans of YouTube “frying” vegetables in water. Is olive oil a sin to vegans or what
8129 2018-02-26 04:42:18 Vitamin D made   With  help of sun is actually made in the oil of the skin  and it takes time. If you shower to soon all this lost
8130 2018-02-26 04:42:17 On another note imma chill on the flower and use oil/wax
8131 2018-02-26 04:42:04 Cool man. You can buy that if you want. Enjoy the rest of your meaningless season....
8132 2018-02-26 04:41:59 Magnum: Why cant I find gear that fits? Me: Well if you didnt have a body like Olive Oil you might.
8133 2018-02-26 04:41:56 Pretty sure a lot of the earthquake activity is related to the aggressive oil drilling that transpired there.
8134 2018-02-26 04:41:53 Ugh auto correct lol castor oil hahah
8135 2018-02-26 04:41:43 @nielsonTSN1260 if Nashville is truly trying to get Karlsson for something around Subban. Do you think Oil will try to be a third team to get PK since Ottawa doesn’t want to spend money
8136 2018-02-26 04:41:31 my mom just butt dialed me from the casino on a sunday night at almost midnight. I am tucked into bed with my oil diffuser on full blast. who is the 22 year old again
8137 2018-02-26 04:41:30 *puts wine in oil diffuser for calming effects*
8138 2018-02-26 04:41:15 You are hearing what you want to hear. Again, they play every game to win but if they don't, it means nothing. The goal is to get into the playoffs & that isn't happening.
8139 2018-02-26 04:41:07 Lol whaaa? Castro oil?
8140 2018-02-26 04:40:43 I use my maracuja oil every day! 
8141 2018-02-26 04:40:43 first night trying jojoba oil on my face
8142 2018-02-26 04:40:32 I’m sure coconut oil will help somehow!!
8143 2018-02-26 04:40:32 Biggest concentration of them is also where the biggest oil spill in history is. Weird how that works
8144 2018-02-26 04:40:31 Trump is always way too magnanimous. It's a fault of his.
8145 2018-02-26 04:40:16 If you're having a stressful day man or woman, do 1 thing that will make you feel good about yourself. Mine is face masking and moisturizing with coconut oil. My skin loves coconut oil
8146 2018-02-26 04:40:15 え、君顎あるの？顎ってやっぱりどこかで買うの？僕顎持ってないんだけど。
8147 2018-02-26 04:40:11 Extra virgin olive oil
8148 2018-02-26 04:40:09 the £ to $ is barely different now from when the ref date. Oil, commodities etc are priced in $. The universal currency is the $, The eu represents 0.5 billion people out of a world population of 7.6 billion
8149 2018-02-26 04:40:05 Bruh same! But I’ve done research and ppl say Castro oil works very well
8150 2018-02-26 04:39:57 @CREWcrew so here’s what @EPAScottPruitt wants, he’s taken Devon oil and big oil/gas brides pac donations for years from Oklahoma oil/gas gated Trumo called him many names until iq45 tapped him to lead aka gut epa after suing epa 6+ on behalf of big oil/gas and NOT OK

8153 2018-02-26 04:39:36 I don't think anybody in the organization is interested in those any more. Besides, the lottery can flip anybody into the top 3 who missed the playoffs.
8154 2018-02-26 04:39:21 Now for reality. Oil demand is INCREASING EVERY YEAR. You obstructing Gay friendly Oil is forcing buyers to enrich Gay killing dictators. Your choice. Sad that you seem obvious to the  tossing that you are promoting. @vancouverpride @VictoriaPride
8155 2018-02-26 04:39:20 I have discovered that capping which is stated in clause 85 of the Petroleum Bill, 2017 is going to undermine expected revenues.
Capping limits our Oil share to percentage of the County Gvt Allocation which keeps on changing.

8156 2018-02-26 04:38:58 why is there jamaican castor oil in my kitchen cabinet
8157 2018-02-26 04:38:30 I disagree it means the possibility of a lower draft pick
8158 2018-02-26 04:37:59 I second this. Chopped up garlic and olive oil w some salt and pepper in the oven. PA QUE TE CUENTO
8159 2018-02-26 04:37:56 Guess you just ignore the 5X as many foreign & US oil tankers traversing the Straits of Juan de Fuca, Haro & Georgia.
8160 2018-02-26 04:37:50 For the left, that's one of the things they wanted to achieve...next week, all the followers will start getting ads for Democrat candidates and pleading for donations
8161 2018-02-26 04:37:46 Safaree just made me wanna buy some of his coconut oil 
8162 2018-02-26 04:37:35 Snake oil type claims are always suspect. Tried ultrasound as a former physiotherapist myself. US is great for inflammation and soft tissue injuries, it's not for neurologic pain. TENS or Interfferential, as electrotherapy could help some.
8163 2018-02-26 04:36:56 Where’s my holy oil lmaooo
8164 2018-02-26 04:36:12 so let's get this straight, you said I should do research, I did and gave you facts that you still do not respond to then you tell me all the facts support the pipeline but refuse to quote any that you say exist, other than quote a paid oil lobby, sounds like a bot to me
8165 2018-02-26 04:35:59 I just bought coconut oil on amazon yesterday. Ima slab it on my head
8166 2018-02-26 04:35:57 While he's secretly celebrating  that North Sea oil will be easier to get . $$$$ billions for him  and his partners, Putin and Tillerson. Not joking, they don't even hide it.
8167 2018-02-26 04:35:50 Ouuuu n some loud massage oil , I AM AMPED !!!
8168 2018-02-26 04:35:28 God will not bless you until He can trust you.

8170 2018-02-26 04:35:11 i burned palo santo, meditated, got my dragon’s blood incense going plus i’m hotboxing my room with orange essential oil & my rose quartz, black onyx, selenite, red jasper, and amethyst are chilling next to me bless up
8171 2018-02-26 04:35:04 If there are any players that don’t have the desire to win (regardless of the Oilers situation) we don’t need those players next season. Saying these games don’t mean anything is a VERY incorrect statement.
@Oil_Drop
8172 2018-02-26 04:34:57 Lavender oil is a must have for me too. It's a blessing to have
8173 2018-02-26 04:34:34 At this point, I might just learn how to do it and make you save money, I could change oil on all your cars.

8177 2018-02-26 04:34:18 Yes and you can try rubbing pueria Mirifica oil on your boobs to grow them. There's a lot of different herbs you can take to grow them bigger. Massage the boobs can also help

8188 2018-02-26 04:32:49 I like honey oil, yes. Squirt in your mouth, put it in a pen, dab it, all kinds of ways to use and all are freindly with my sick lungs too.

8196 2018-02-26 04:31:36 Not suggesting but rather saying it is indeed true. They will compete every time out & try to win but if they don't, it really doesn't matter.

8198 2018-02-26 04:31:05 Apparently it's a shield bug and they love beans, tomatoes etc.  so I need to spray with oil.  Companion plant hyssop, lavender and borage

8202 2018-02-26 04:30:18 Lmaoooo I knew Safaree wasn’t trending for his music or coconut oil 
8203 2018-02-26 04:30:02 Were the Oil Kings at home? #ouch
8204 2018-02-26 04:29:58 @Gav_Leaf Gav just did the math - 1 full stack of oil shale in 7 days breaks down into 50000 gas. we have at least 2.
8205 2018-02-26 04:29:57 The leadership core will be the same. It’s fine if the last 20+ games are meaningless for you. I’m sure it’s like that for lots of people. But don’t suggest it is for the players
8206 2018-02-26 04:29:47 Lol. Seems like yesterday being 15 sitting on an old couch having a guy show his oil paintings. One was a self portrait with glowing red eyes. Scary ass reefer dude
8207 2018-02-26 04:29:44 Why is Kessler allowed time and time again to take liberties with Connor McDavid. Someone on the Oil needs to send a message next game. I think we all know who I'm referring too... #cantscoremightaswellfightLooch

8210 2018-02-26 04:29:03 Would oil you all over.
8211 2018-02-26 04:28:36 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
8212 2018-02-26 04:28:24 That's where we disagree. Those things won't carry over and especially not when the roster will be quite different.
8213 2018-02-26 04:28:10 Submerged ASIC in non-conductive mineral oil to reduce sound and energy. Fans do not input as much work to cool the boards therefor run much quieter. You can honestly hardly hear it!

8216 2018-02-26 04:26:56 I received a unsolicited #cockshot today. But it was actually a very nice penis. It looked cared for using the most organic coconut oil #WholeFoods carries. I still deleted the email but I was offended as I usually am 
8217 2018-02-26 04:26:38 They don’t want to share anything. They are doing exactly what America is doing. They set up military bases in these countries with one thing in mind. Taking over. Iran is the #4 oil producer in the world. What’s the best way to get to Iran? Through Syria.
8218 2018-02-26 04:26:34 ray moor posed a threat to every schoolgirl in Alabama and he not only owned a gun but whipped it out and waved it around everybody on stage, flinging his gun oil all over everything, teaching the little girls all about bearing arms, your argument is bullshit fox!

8220 2018-02-26 04:25:45 Umm -- if cooking oil treated yeast, that you wouldn't use oil in yeast bread, now would you?  How can people ignore common sense for "the next big thing" so readily?
8221 2018-02-26 04:25:45 Which Bollywood star had endorsed the following brands at different times : Lux, Ching's Secret, Vanish detergent, Tanishq jewellery and Dabur Amla Hair Oil ?
8222 2018-02-26 04:25:26 @MYANC and delivering good service to the people of South Africa are water and oil,they will never mix
8223 2018-02-26 04:25:25 Again, go back and look at recent Oilers history or ask any player who's played at said level and I bet you almost all will tell you, it doesn't translate to the next year.
8224 2018-02-26 04:25:25 Are you for real? Your club was mid table, money is earned through trophies and status of being a big club which city werent when they got oil money. Look at Tottenham, they were mid table, got a new manager who sorted them out and made them better...
8225 2018-02-26 04:25:13 Fuck palm oil
8226 2018-02-26 04:24:19 It is obvious that oil is losing its pre-eminent position as a major source of energy in the world. There is emerging a shift from dependence on oil and gas as source of energy to solar based energy. There are clear signals of this shift the world over, including #India.
8227 2018-02-26 04:24:00 The oil will detract from my size

8230 2018-02-26 04:23:49 No one said these games are as important as the ones playoff teams are playing. What I’m saying is you’re writing these games off as nothing. There’s a TON to gain from finishing a season strong in regards to momentum, pride, and confidence
8231 2018-02-26 04:23:48 สู้จย้าาาาา
8232 2018-02-26 04:23:45 Which idiot thought THAT was a good idea? What was our CAPITALIST economy supposed to be fueled by? We aren’t oil rich etc.
Who voted for hobbling our nation? They should have been hung like the economic traitors they were.
8233 2018-02-26 04:23:41 Does Your Engine Seems To Be Louder Than Usual?
 Properly-lubricated engine parts have a normal ambient noise to them. If the engine is either excessively noisy overall, or revving up louder than normal on startup, then it’s a sign the oil needs to be changed. #CaltexBebaBeba

8236 2018-02-26 04:22:59 Damn Safaree...so where can one purchase all of you coconut oil?
8237 2018-02-26 04:22:41 Oil change then car wash tomorrow 
8238 2018-02-26 04:22:32 until Dump and appointees remove all protections for oil. Only money matters.
8239 2018-02-26 04:21:59 It means nothing. It may make some fans feel better but that is about it.
8240 2018-02-26 04:21:26 Somebody said Safaree dropped the best advertisement for his coconut oil and I’ve been screaming ever since 
8241 2018-02-26 04:21:23 Chest congestion, too? If so, get some mullein tea. It works wonders with my asthma. It also comes in the form of a tasteless oil, which can be put into any drink.
8242 2018-02-26 04:21:11 U notice GOLD, OIL, Futs,  everything is going UP again.  All is normal in this world.
8243 2018-02-26 04:21:05 After Gall bladder removal many have Chronic Diarrhea, especially if eating anything that doesn't agree with your body. I'm thankful I don't have that issue, but I did have to do trial and air with food, but was quick to learn No Meat, No Dairy, No fat/oil(or miniscule amounts)
8244 2018-02-26 04:20:54 lavender oil is my absolute favorite 
8245 2018-02-26 04:20:26 1 - remove extra fat on lamb rack 
2 - remove all the fat from the bones ( french style ) keep the fat ( it can be used later) 
3 - season with garlic , salt, pepper , olive oil,  bay leaf, and rosemary
4 - rest for how much you like in the seasoning

8247 2018-02-26 04:20:23 Crude oil varies in composition depending entirely on the mineral sentiments, time, and pressure. How do you account for the wide varieties and qualities of crude oil if not geophysical processes? Were it derived from microscopic plants, it would be more uniform.
8248 2018-02-26 04:19:58 The quiet trickling sound of the water in my essential oil diffuser is so calming
8249 2018-02-26 04:19:48 No food = fatigue = no labor = accidents = the end of the Venezuelan oil industry  #squatVZLA
8250 2018-02-26 04:19:33 Maybe baby oil.
8251 2018-02-26 04:19:33 The motives ARE. The Golan. The Israeli theft of resources; oil AND water. The list of amoral investors in that theft reads like a collection of globalist vultures. And all being done on land illegally exploited by that "Bastion of Democracy, Israel"; 'defensively' of course.
8252 2018-02-26 04:19:13 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。

8256 2018-02-26 04:19:02 As best as you can get it, whole plant from tip to root equals 1 pound equals 60 g of oil. Worth the effort

8258 2018-02-26 04:18:52 We say we're "spreading freedom" but honestly a lot of the wars were started to steal resources. The U.S. has been waging war in the Middle East for oil since at least 1945. Even if you want to bring up 9/11 that was Afghanistan.
8259 2018-02-26 04:18:51 If it's an oil spill it's accidental, piping of sewage straight in to the ocean is on purpose? False equivalent?

8271 2018-02-26 04:16:17 I had my Gallbladder removed over a year ago, had no other option. Since then, I have not been able to tolerate any type of Meat, Dairy, any dense Foods and very minimal oil/fats. Needless to say, looks like I will be Whole Foods, Plant-based for life. But feeling the best ever.
8272 2018-02-26 04:16:13 Pride is an issue if the team flat out quits & this team has shown no sign of doing that & very few actually do. Like it or not, teams who are fighting for a post-season spot or positioning are at different level.

8275 2018-02-26 04:15:56 give me all those stats that you claim to have and I will do the math but try to get them from independent sources instead of the paid oil lobby to have any credibility
8276 2018-02-26 04:15:41 Agreed. If, say, Larsson gets hurt in the last game of the year, and Chia fails to address the d depth (again) in the offseason, won't matter if the Oilers win all the fans down the stretch.

8298 2018-02-26 04:12:16 Trump started working on jobs well before he took office. Even had meetings with several auto and steel manufacturers before he was sworn in. Under Obama many people simply gave up on finding a job and most of the jobs under Obama were low wage service jobs. Obama cut coal & oil

8309 2018-02-26 04:11:01 the proposed pipeline is not for Canada but for export so your question is moot as to where I want to buy oil from but keep trying to change the facts
8310 2018-02-26 04:10:53 Mike Hudema Greenpeace says more jobs in US in solar than oil, gas, coal while US may be worlds largest oil producer.  Trump wins again.
8311 2018-02-26 04:10:49 Oil is too expensive above $90 bbl and too cheap below $40 bbl.
$60 seems to be a price where the dollar is weak enough to spur global liquidity, but not too high to cause fuel driven inflation.
8312 2018-02-26 04:10:44 Are the ones who take the big pharma and big oil money on notice to because I recall a certain opioid epidemic no one shut up about before a week ago!

Hmmmm….jadi penasaran deh. Ada nggak sih manfaat  baby oil lainnya?

8345 2018-02-26 04:07:21 So tonight marked my first night applying almond oil underneath my eyes to help with the dark circles. It might not help, but my eyes smell nice.
8346 2018-02-26 04:07:16 Yeah, I understand dusting/polishing leaves, but I'm surprised they'd say to use coconut oil. Water and a dustrag will get the same results, without providing a pest attraction and clogging the plant's respiration.
8347 2018-02-26 04:07:15 And I have tried all the atypical trigeminal neuralgia/TMJ meds. The only one that helped and I don't react to, gabapentin, the effect is wearing off. I can tell with my muscular fibro stuff getting worse as well. Have a friend whose using CBD oil.
8348 2018-02-26 04:07:01 Really. Have you forgot the times when just the Oilers alone played better over the past 6 or 7 yrs after they were in garbage time & it translated to nothing...and that's just them. Even Chia has said in 2 of his 3 yrs that reading much into this time of yr is dangerous & it is.

pretty much any oil will work, it is all in what you believe
8381 2018-02-26 04:02:36 I have asked that years ago. I was told that BHO Admin had no intention to commission any new nuke power plants of which are zero carb emissions. One of the first things Obama tried to pass was "carbon tax", for example slapping $10 onto every barrel of oil, etc.

8458 2018-02-26 03:55:48 Where/when does the Russian money laundering train end? I imagine $30.00 a barrel oil for 5-6 years and an economic downturn would probably do the trick.
8459 2018-02-26 03:55:46 You think the guy who sold a draft pick (I know it’s a different sport) at the outset of a rebuild then subsequently kept his team (one of the most profitable in the world) below a salary floor is going to be the top bidder for a top FA? OK. Sure. You got any snake oil I can buy?
8460 2018-02-26 03:55:40 ホ～、なるほど！と感心するけど、いざそういう状況になったときに忘れてるシリーズ　＞RT
8461 2018-02-26 03:55:39 WWL: you still can't count on the Oil to help you out.
8462 2018-02-26 03:55:33 3) Indonesia and Malaysia as the world's No. 1 & No. 2 producers of palm oil must join hands to defeat the narrow EU efforts to sabotage palm oil and exert greater control over the global market.
8463 2018-02-26 03:55:33 Immigrants come here looking for jobs. We have to have them to keep allowing for immigration. Oil companies produce 100,000s of jobs! Good for America good for immigrants!!

8472 2018-02-26 03:54:46 Australia can't fix this on its own. We need international support to transition to renewables, but the oil producers control policies.

8474 2018-02-26 03:54:32 Because you didn’t live in one of the countries the US prosecuted its proxy wars over oil .
8475 2018-02-26 03:54:24 2) Every private oil palm plantations company are investing in Indonesia cos of land but there are Govt restrictions imposed on them and they cannot buy more land. With Eagle High, FELDA's acreage in Indonesia rivals that of WILMAR.

8478 2018-02-26 03:54:15 Yeah. I agree too. If you can buy the claim that there is a god then you could also fall for the claim that he made a book with perfect truth in it if you read it just right from a very particular translation. That’s peddling some mighty rich snake oil to the highly credulous.

8492 2018-02-26 03:52:30 Asparagus + olive oil + curry powder + garlic salt + grill = heaven.
8493 2018-02-26 03:52:30 Sorry I tuned into the game, we gonna lose. Thought about watching the kings game, didn't and the oil won. #promisenotoeatchanymore

8495 2018-02-26 03:52:25 Chris, listen to me. I need you to rescue two hostages from an underwater oil field. Agent Sherry Birkin... ...and Jake Muller. He's Albert Wesker's son.

8504 2018-02-26 03:51:19 I’m not a purist. I’d prefer no government intervention. But no one complains about the oil sand today getting their start with that sort of assistance. Well maybe eco-types.

8506 2018-02-26 03:51:09 in #Vietnam the Ministry of Finance has proposed raising environmental protection taxes on oil and petroleum products from the current 3,000 VND (13 US cents) to the ceiling level of 4,000 VND (17 cents) per litre beginning July 1, 2018
8507 2018-02-26 03:51:07 I enjoy watching Sister Wives! I have noticed though, that the  front doors on the wives’ houses squeak when opened. The squeaks take away from the beauty of the homes. Please oil the hinges.

8513 2018-02-26 03:50:29 Not even watching the Oil game, haven't in weeks...twitter feed has me angry.  How can they have the best player since Mario at 4M in a cap league and not even make the playoffs?  #firethemall #fedup

8528 2018-02-26 03:48:49 Your amazing right up to the moment your really tested and you fail. 
I'm sure revenue from traffic fines was great, stray dogs minimal. 
8529 2018-02-26 03:48:45 Did you see this? Why isn't Canada not working towards renewable, ethical & un polluting energy? Why are we made to pay carbon tax to allow your gouvernement to. Pollute and promote more unsustainable practices? We ship oil to 1 country and import from another. Great stupid logic

8534 2018-02-26 03:48:02 I'm talking scientific evidence- not feelings. By #TransMountain's own estimate, there's a 1 in 10 chance of a major tanker spill occurring, and 1/3 of the oil spilled wouldn't be cleaned up.
8535 2018-02-26 03:47:51 No really. I'm all for them finishing well but it means nothing & pretend like it matters is pointless.
8536 2018-02-26 03:47:48 I have been #obsessed with making apples and pecans w cinnamon nutmeg vanilla extract and a little coconut oil. talk about a SNACK

8548 2018-02-26 03:46:22 It means absolutely nothing come next season. There are two positives that could come of a good finish to the season. McDavid wins the Art Ross & Slepyshev does enough to earn an actual shot in 2018-19.

8584 2018-02-26 03:43:07 If that were true (we're all in this together), perhaps you would spend more time announcing such innitiatives here in Canada, and less time represeting the interests of Texas based oil companies.
8585 2018-02-26 03:42:57 Yea they are. Convenient then that the oil and gas industry is among the most profitable in the world. They can afford it.

8610 2018-02-26 03:40:05 I have one sitting here that I haven't touched yet. I'm thinking of using thinned out oil paint using similar but not identical colors.
8611 2018-02-26 03:40:05 That's a pretty poor 20 seconds of hockey. Oilers gonna oil.

8619 2018-02-26 03:39:36 Why does Todd McLellan still have a job? Oil choke away a two goal lead in the last minute of play.

8621 2018-02-26 03:39:30 What's the false premise? IMHO, it is in the national interest to protect the Salish Sea, critical habitat for endangered Southern Resident Killer Whales, from a potentially catastrophic tanker oil spill.

8679 2018-02-26 03:33:38 We need both, but oil needs to be sipped rather than guzzled.

8729 2018-02-26 03:26:19 i heard vitamin e oil is good, i use cocoa butter and it works, tea tree oil (dilute it if you get the strong kind) and use face masks or lotions that say "lightening or brightening" on them bc it helps to brighten dark spots

8749 2018-02-26 03:23:06 ... I was going to say something about trucks running on CNG but there's still motor oil, and most of it isn't synthetic...
8750 2018-02-26 03:23:01 Sure I do. Analogies need to be apt though. Comparing a car needing oil to sand on a beach is an analogy. It's not apt though for it doesn't explain anything.

Is it 1) They've now allowed lead bullets to be used in hunting 2) They want to pump as much oil as they can out of America or 3) Pruitt is a traitor to America?

8840 2018-02-26 03:09:14 What a tone deaf comment. Why don’t you go back to having your head buried in the sand? Although I’m sure than sand has been contaminated by offshore oil bearing vessels, so I’d be careful.

8902 2018-02-26 03:00:34 So I mixed rose hip oil, vitamin E oil, Jojoba Oil, Tamunu oil, grape seed oil and sunflower oil and it’s really doing wonders for my skin
8903 2018-02-26 03:00:22 12時を、オイルがお知らせいたします。昼食にオイルが使われてるか探してみましょう。
8904 2018-02-26 03:00:16 Ms. Tzeporah should stick to environmental objections to oil sands development. Leave the financial implications to those who are investing their money.
8905 2018-02-26 03:00:03 OIL DIFF: 3.57 -> 3.62
8906 2018-02-26 02:59:36 former band mate I haven't heard in 30yrs just contacted me and asked for studio40 to record a demo. seniors discount. I said ya  fill my furnace oil, buy food & bev and you sleep in the tent & the studio is $300 hr plus materials. Feedback will be nuclear from DDO on this tweet.
8907 2018-02-26 02:58:59 I do not think so. Nobody needs oil in such capacities as many forecasters say. The power grid will be modified to use new tech etc. Base on this forecast it looks cost of living will be more expensive in the future.
8908 2018-02-26 02:58:40 Yes. Lol it’s a Swedish massage. I have went there for years but never knew. I was on my stomach at one point and they use hot oil and they were rubbing my ass and everywhere. I was like this can’t be legal lmao
8909 2018-02-26 02:58:39 Russia is not even attacking.  Europe wanted oil, and Russia built the #NordStream2 without shooting bullets, a quite different thing VS the "Regime Change" failed policy from Irak,  Libya to Syria and no legal oil so far.
8910 2018-02-26 02:58:18 The sanctions creates a ban on that. 
Russians aren’t dumb...neither are those companies involved with the extraction of oil. They are bidding on a ton of oil fields now knowing that if this passes American Companies can’t bid on them.  (Explained by DBongino) 4/5
8911 2018-02-26 02:58:05 Long day! Gonna have to whip out my go to routine. Lavender and peppermint essential oil on my pillow. Mint tea in my belly! Happy dreaming. Tomorrow is another day. 
8912 2018-02-26 02:57:56 He’s selling coconut oil when he ought to be selling the molds for that thang cuz lawd!!!!
8913 2018-02-26 02:57:53 in my bag rn: argan oil, a pillow pet, peanut butter m&ms, bb cream
not in my bag but i actually need it: a fucking pencil
8914 2018-02-26 02:57:50 someone: my head hurts 
me: you can use this lavender essential oil! 
someone: I have acne 
me: omg use this tea tree oil! 
someone: someone shot me in the leg 
me: peppermint essential oil!!!
8915 2018-02-26 02:57:12 ive heard if its drying your hair out you need to add some type of essential oil to it but i'm still not impressed. idk if you've heard of bouncecurl but their cream conditioner is the best thing i've EVER used 10/10 recommend. shea moisture besides that!
8916 2018-02-26 02:57:11 I know @27MilanLucic has a nmc but he needs to bring more to the table or give the Oil a list to who he would be willing to be traded to. Enough of mediocre play, at least play physical and with an edge, just do something.
8917 2018-02-26 02:57:10 I used to change oil “professionally”            20yrs ago.
8918 2018-02-26 02:57:10 Whoever owns that will break it up and sell it off to diff govs, oil companies etc..In order to prevent everyone from having to build their own pipelines on the ocean floor to get the oil out they will work as a team and share one pipeline that might have 20 rigs flowing to it3/5
8919 2018-02-26 02:56:45 Not to shabby when can I get a @CatSpotLitter sprint car attire from the website want a shirt and hoodie asap lol
8920 2018-02-26 02:56:38 Just got home from the gym, Ducks and Oilers about to start the 3rd, Oil up 3-2...Anaheim can’t lose this game at home to Edmonton.
8921 2018-02-26 02:56:37 Well, Canadian governments are the reason. It’s because we are taxed, while gas in the US is subsidized. GST, PST, carbon tax, fuel tax. Also, not enough oil is refined here.
8922 2018-02-26 02:56:32 Meanwhile: The head of the EPA says the Bible tells him to drill for more oil, burn more coal and to use poison pesticides. Fun bunch.
8923 2018-02-26 02:56:26 Castor oil and Cantu curl cream.
8924 2018-02-26 02:56:02 dewalt 20v cordless drill, 1 inch drill bit, and some cutting oil should do the trick. just have a budding distract the manager while you're doing it
8925 2018-02-26 02:55:58 Just ingested some oil, now to take my exam before it kicks in
8926 2018-02-26 02:55:51 Oil steady near 2-week high as Saudi to keep export curbs #Market
8927 2018-02-26 02:55:50 1)I suppose CN is saying it is “winter”. Well years ago when farmers were having issues with service, spotting of rail cars for farm commodities, I am stopped by CN train, which was hauling 95% oil cars! No problems with oil, but farm commodities could not be hauled. Really?
8928 2018-02-26 02:55:43 and i did an oil treatment on my hair aND i worked out today an icon
8929 2018-02-26 02:55:40 Damn this coconut oil got my eyes burning
8930 2018-02-26 02:55:32 The sanctions have something that
Would prevent US oil companies from working not only in in Russia but also around the world. For instance...they find  a big field in the middle of the ocean.  2/5
8931 2018-02-26 02:55:30 Trying to remember if it was for the engine or oil, I know there was a light on the cart for something
8932 2018-02-26 02:55:25 Undermining Russian oil?  That is some impressive spin.
8933 2018-02-26 02:55:17 * rubs in the oil feeling the sticky slime i smile and ask.* "um so your like a slime dragon right so like do you burn?"
8934 2018-02-26 02:55:12 I’m watching oil closely and may pull the trigger soon on $OILD
8935 2018-02-26 02:55:04 Do we have any lube?  Like, at this point even olive oil would help me get this drawer unstuck.
8936 2018-02-26 02:54:52 高木さんさすがにからかい上手とかいうレベルを超えてるんだよなあ
8937 2018-02-26 02:54:38 I popped into your demo, my friend and stood on side of the tent watching you. When you were pouring olive oil down two unsuspecting people’s gullets. You did great as always. 
8938 2018-02-26 02:54:27 Never know with BT. His work ethic is incredible and no doubt he’s burning the midnight oil down at the Dome as we speak.
8939 2018-02-26 02:53:42 ありがたいですー！

8955 2018-02-26 02:51:23 Where was highest junk food claimed? Where was highest palm oil claimed? Seemed like an off-hand (seemingly inaccurate) comment in the paper but not arising from associated data.

8969 2018-02-26 02:48:14 The egg, mayo & olive oil hair treatment is actually REALLY good. Especially if you got naturally curly hair & you’re looking for a treatment that helps define the curl pattern. Thank me later 
8970 2018-02-26 02:47:59 I finally broke down and got one of those stupid oil diffusers, after being told by a shitload of people that it helps with anxiety. And yall, if I ain't ready to take a nap at 8pm. What kind of aromatic weed yall put in this????

8972 2018-02-26 02:47:39 Let me see if I have this straight.

Western grain farmers are struggling to ship their goods to market because trains are all moving oil.

Oil is on trains because pipelines are not good for the environment.

Dumping a whole lot of raw sewage into the water is ok though.

Wow.
8973 2018-02-26 02:47:38 So where do I get this oil !? @IAMSAFAREE asking so I can rub it on you !
8974 2018-02-26 02:47:32 I'm really bad at coloring on the computer because I am using more oil like paint tools, but I'm so used to coloring with watercolors I always try to build up the colors and darks and stuff LOL

8982 2018-02-26 02:46:38 i been looking for oil for a whole week already,, a whole fuckin week.
8983 2018-02-26 02:46:34 Purchasers may not want refined product which limits the products they are able to utilize from the raw oil products. Bitumen is not just vehicle fuel or heating oil.
8984 2018-02-26 02:46:19 There is nothing else in contemporary business to compare with the potential power of the tech giants. Their combined power is worldwide. 

In the past, oil companies, for one, started to gain such power. The Federal Govetnment stepped in with anti-trust laws and broke them up.
8985 2018-02-26 02:46:10 @DonaldTrump If Supreme Court goes negative in "Oil States" the Globalists will have won.  Nothing will have changed.  Vote to not allow individuals to sue Banks, Brokerages etc... forcing arbitration is a win for the Globalists.  They can destroy any person, arb is a sick joke.
8986 2018-02-26 02:46:04 Hot oil just came up and splashed me all over my neck. And not in a sexy way

8989 2018-02-26 02:45:28 Ya know, these weed oil pens all the kids are using are legit. Think I'm gonna go get me one of them medical cards. As they're now half the price, and I realized I have arthritis/take meds for it, so I don't have to make up a lie to get one.
8990 2018-02-26 02:45:26 Perhaps. It still shows they haven't cleaned it up or contained the spill. 

What will happen if an oil tanker spilled it's cargo tomorrow?

We're no where near ready.

9000 2018-02-26 02:44:21 usually keep a spray bottle w/ water, oils( argan, Jamaican castor, coconut, tea tree, olive), and my Cantu hydrating conditioner. Using that to wet my hair, then going in with a quarter drop of the L’Oréal oil in cream and tea tree. The moisture, the shine, and smell be popping.

Melt together in microwave about 15-25 seconds: 2 TBSP olive oil, 2TBSP butter, 1-2 tsp sriracha (to taste). Stir well. Pour desired amount over popped corn and toss well; season with salt. Sprinkle with hot paprika or cayenne for more kick.
9012 2018-02-26 02:42:30 Crush some garlic in a pan with some oil. Throw some chopped up carrots and snap peas in and stir them around for a bit. Add cold rice and some beaten eggs in. Open a beer. Stir everything together. Add some soy sauce. Measure absolutely nothing during this process.

9020 2018-02-26 02:41:42 Interesting economic fact from 2006: the Arab world was so economically weak and dependent upon the West buying its oil, that if oil were to cease being important, the entire Arab world would have the same market value as Nokia.
I wonder how their non-oil economy is doing today.
9021 2018-02-26 02:41:24 I need a repaint And mink oil

9032 2018-02-26 02:39:25 Yep, CBD oil is great for inflammation. It also has less than 1% THC so it is legal in all 50 states. You can buy it just about anywhere with a pharmacy (CVS, Walmart, Walgreens, etc) or Amazon.
9033 2018-02-26 02:39:24 Baking soda and coconut oil, try to drink a lot of water. when water gets boring add fruits
9034 2018-02-26 02:38:45 Individual greedy humans make war!!

안녕하세요 퀸야님^^ 흔적 남겨 주셔서 찾아왔습니다! 혹시 실수가 아니시면 팔로 드려도 될까요?
9037 2018-02-26 02:38:34 I have tried many. Honestly, right now, I'm using retin-A and then just coconut oil. I do like Shiseido Future Solution LX and Revive, but I don't even know if these fancy brands do all that much more once the retin-A comes into play. (But I am not an expert.)
9038 2018-02-26 02:38:34 I think you give DD too much credit.  He wasn't selling snake oil.  He just has absolutely no idea about what he's taking about.  I bet there's permanent lift music in his head.
9039 2018-02-26 02:38:33 To grant comfort and joy to those who mourn, to give them a diadem of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of joy instead of mourning, the garment of praise instead of a heavy burdened spirit!!!
Isaiah 61:3
9040 2018-02-26 02:38:19 Put magnesium oil on them.
9041 2018-02-26 02:37:57 So much for #TransMountain being approved by Ottawa because it is in the national interest to diversify markets for tar sands oil to Asia!
9042 2018-02-26 02:37:41 My dog is so spoiled, he will go grab his salmon oil out of my bathroom cabinet just so I will put some on his dog food.

9046 2018-02-26 02:37:02 It's as slick as an oil spill, as sugary as an eclair, and many moviegoers will find it irresistible. #PraiseFOX

9053 2018-02-26 02:35:26 Oil of Olay.
9054 2018-02-26 02:35:25 That’s a dude?
9055 2018-02-26 02:35:21 I think he looks like a grandma who went in for a shampoo and set and decided to get a little crazy.

9057 2018-02-26 02:34:25 He is considering replacing Scott Pruitt with Joe Hazelwood at the helm of EPA.  Why settle for someone with no experience running oil tankers aground when you can foul an entire Federal agency with someone who has?
9058 2018-02-26 02:34:16 The mayors commuting habits aren’t the cause of global warming. Industries like the oil industry ARE to blame. Quit that dumb misdirection. It’s a question of scale! No one person is consuming enough oil to be a problem. Except maybe you, the PR bro. You are full of gas.

9062 2018-02-26 02:33:30 coconut oil is the best ever
9063 2018-02-26 02:33:14 Yeah, that seems about right.  Bc evidently some kids are more valuable than others... especially if you agree with CNN and Twitter.
9064 2018-02-26 02:33:00 I tend to make a mixture of water,  peppermint castor oil(Jamaican black),
Lavender castor oil and a leave in spray oil of your choice. 
Shake well spray spray spray
9065 2018-02-26 02:32:16 The NRA is as much a lobby group as is Oil and Gas, Pharma and Agriculture, but to make it out as this massive force compared to other groups is commical. You want change? Vote campaign finance reform!
9066 2018-02-26 02:32:06 Wrong. Proverbs 21:20 says: "Precious treasure and oil are in a wise man's dwelling, but a foolish man devours it" . My. Pruitt, how about solar, wind, hydro energy. The Bible says so!

9182 2018-02-26 02:14:53 para recoger un poco el vómito: primer paso modify your eating habits then (1) double cleanse (all-clean balm de heimish es mi go-to o cualquier balm/oil cleanser, then anti-inflammatory kinda soap) (2) toner thayers (3) experiment with hydrating/healing oils puros (4) moisturize
9183 2018-02-26 02:14:48 What kind of oil and where is it available?
9184 2018-02-26 02:14:44 CBD is legit man. I don’t smoke, but use CBD oil for arthritis in my knees.

9190 2018-02-26 02:13:41 I just LOVE how some oil paints cost 6 dollars but others cost 18 dollars even tho THEYRE THE SAME SIZE!! 
WHY DO MAKING CERTAIN COLORS HAVE TO BE SO EXPENSIVE

9191 2018-02-26 02:13:36 *Would* hurt the party.  I'm not for the "move over, everyone over 35½ years of age.  Exclusion has never worked.  The system didn't work because WE didn't get Dems to go cast their ballots.  Nancy & Dianne were busting their butts the whole time. 

I, too, popped popcorn w/ oil.
9192 2018-02-26 02:13:10 Nice ! Need to rerun tho lol I couldn’t do pulls I needed my oil change I was lagging at 4500 rpm lol

9194 2018-02-26 02:13:03 What is a headlamp restoration? Glad you asked. SOOOOOO much less expensive than a new light. Ask about this service next oil change.
9195 2018-02-26 02:12:55 Got a spot at CNN already.
9196 2018-02-26 02:12:49 They use sunflower oil instead.
9197 2018-02-26 02:12:46 And as mentioned end of last week. Key ratios for oil just came off ANOTHER sell signal
9198 2018-02-26 02:12:19 We also have an American activist who has tried for years to close down salmon farming. She gets money from the Pew foundation for one. You know the Pew family who invested in the tar sands  amongst other oil deals and made billions now doing their best to destroy aquaculture
9199 2018-02-26 02:12:11 My mom broke a essential oil bottle and it spilled everywhere.... now my entire house smells.... it was lemon grass now that smell is permanently stuck in my nostrils now I’m going to smell like lemons for quite awhile

9214 2018-02-26 02:10:09 What kind of oil?
9215 2018-02-26 02:10:07 A little moisture goes a long way, coconut oil fellas. It gives you that glow and it’s vagina approved.
9216 2018-02-26 02:10:04 I’d hate to see him leave the Oil but would be so happy to see him move back home closer to his son. Oiler fans will always love you Bigrig
9217 2018-02-26 02:09:59 i had oil painting this morning and wasnt near a window djdbssjdb
9218 2018-02-26 02:09:56  Nonstick pan
 1-2 tbsp oil when you start
 Medium heat, a bit higher than you’d expect
 Add 1/4 cup water, cover, forget them for 7 minutes (10 if frozen)
9219 2018-02-26 02:09:54 I looked, couldn't find anything, and didn't have the patience to drill down through that paper's refs. Getting the palm oil production wrong makes me want to stop fact-checking...

9222 2018-02-26 02:09:29 I hope you're okay. Getting hot cooking oil anywhere on the skin is bad but the cleavage....yikes.
9223 2018-02-26 02:09:19 I have never used coconut oil in my hair, but all I know is that vitamin E Oil, ARGON OIL and castor oil are my baes.
9224 2018-02-26 02:09:07 Where can one get Rick Simpson oil?
9225 2018-02-26 02:08:41 oil mixture para el cuerpo (que es skin too goddammit): vitamina e + aloe vera (str8 from the plant) + aceite de coco. jabón de cúrcuma y avena es el que mi hermana usa como cleanser en su cara, helps her. she got it de dinah alvarez, tai es otro budget brand, also dr bronners.
9226 2018-02-26 02:08:41 *puts some of this nice smelling rose oil stuff in the bath for her*
9227 2018-02-26 02:08:41 next time I bust out the oil i may feed the african villages in america
9228 2018-02-26 02:08:23 well, they like when they're still in utero. KIds are positively useless "takers" and "eaters" and need school supplies til their 18. Then? They can be sent off to war, have limbs blown off and come back with PTSD. Birth = 17, they're garbage. After that? It's all about oil!
9229 2018-02-26 02:08:20 It's winter lol. The beast from the east it's a conspiracy by Russian oil & gas oligarchs that own corner shops in the uk to make us buy more food inc elec & Gas credit on prepaid card meters for heating 
9230 2018-02-26 02:08:17 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
9231 2018-02-26 02:08:03 Realistically equivalent would be saying dems want ppl to die from opiates, or be killed by illegals which some have said. Both untrue
9232 2018-02-26 02:07:33 Finally exhaled this week—regrouping is like an oil of essence—where the good stuff is. PSA:  The fog has been lifted!. #NRCSDchat
9233 2018-02-26 02:07:33 What source of hemp oil? A brand name?
9234 2018-02-26 02:07:28 The currency was attacked because they anticipated a collapse in the tax base through sanctions and low oil price would force Russia to undertake ‘monetary expansion’ to prevent a depression, does that sound plausible so far?
9235 2018-02-26 02:07:22 what do u use an oil diffuser for :O
9236 2018-02-26 02:07:21 Commodity cues from friday close
Oil gained more than 1%
Base metals declined, LME index down 1%
Gold steady at $1330/oz
9237 2018-02-26 02:07:05 Can they even put oil in their hair? I know their hair gets super oily in like 2 days
9238 2018-02-26 02:07:01 Hmmmm, maybe not. Did you see Jake Tapper interview the sheriff today? He gave no quarter.
9239 2018-02-26 02:06:32 Had to reup on tea tree oil today.
9240 2018-02-26 02:06:14 Still, it is misguided to think the oil sands resource wouldn’t be exploited by any country blessed with it. Even green loving California have the Bakken Fields with an even higher carbon content than Canada’s oil sands. Hollywood types come here to protest, though.
9241 2018-02-26 02:06:10 I think I need to go over it again with my rough files to give it deeper grooves and maybe buy some oil
9242 2018-02-26 02:05:48 My hair smells like so much good ass oil
9243 2018-02-26 02:05:33 E cut, sow am back
9244 2018-02-26 02:05:29 A reminder, that your whining to me is futile. You'll never convince anyone who operates with objectivity to suddenly align their stance with the guilty culprits (Big Oil) and abandons the empirical world of science. Sans #BizarroWorld for me. BRB

9254 2018-02-26 02:04:24 People sniff petrol, do we ban oil?
People overeat, do we ban food?
People speed, do we ban cars?
Here we are effectively removing medications because some people recreationally smoke another product that is barely related.
9255 2018-02-26 02:04:04 Snake oil. At least with a used car salesman you get a car. The car might suck, but at least you have a car & recourse.
9256 2018-02-26 02:03:52 What does trump consider resources? He tried to sell off our oil reserves for what? Crippling EPA and other regulations diverge quick dollar. Our resources are the people.

9261 2018-02-26 02:02:00 The lesson is that winning is HARD. We got used to it, which no clubs (other than United) were more used to. Other clubs have been struggling for years to win anything. We’ve won three in five years. Without oil money or United’s cash, we’re not going to have any easy time of it.

9278 2018-02-26 01:59:49 Ok not funny being accused by my boss of replacing her priceless oil paintings with copy’s.  What do I say ?
9279 2018-02-26 01:59:43 Many types of medicinal cannabis contain very low levels of thc. Cannabinoids are useful as anti inflammatories. Hemp also has medicinal benefits as well as being useful in building, foods and even as a co2 sequester. People sniff petrol, we don’t ban oil
9280 2018-02-26 01:59:39 There is plan but it’s very slow. When Pres Trump listed IRGC as a terror org the next week the attacked oil rich Kirkuk and took it from Kurdish control while 82% of Kirkuk voted yes to the KRG referendum. Kirkuk is more important and has much more oil than Der Ezzoir.
9281 2018-02-26 01:59:39 Tea tree oil smells SO bad
9282 2018-02-26 01:59:24 That could be. It also doesn't claim Oceana eats zero N6. A tablespoon of soybean oil is still only what, 63 calories from linoelic acid? Not unfeasible that some could be in the diet. If anyone has diet data they feel is more accurate I'd certainly check it out.
9283 2018-02-26 01:59:16 Be sure to stop oil pipeline.
9284 2018-02-26 01:59:10 Hey that heating oil to pop popcorn hit close to home! LoL. And what most of these newbees are overlooking, these Women are two of the top fund raisers in the party. Unfortunately it takes money to win. W/O them could hurt whole party.
9285 2018-02-26 01:59:03 I never knew there would be such a profound philosophy in snacks drenched in oil and preservatives. How funny.
9286 2018-02-26 01:59:00 Your point on "whine about Big Government while cashing crop subsidy checks" is particularly on point. I almost lose it when I listen to the Koch brothers rail against government - when they sell more oil to the US Strategic Reserve than any other supplier...
9287 2018-02-26 01:58:53 We might also ask what's happened there since the vikings were put back in their box. Oil, bacon, a financial crisis and Bjork.  I quite like some of those but they're hardly cause for unbridled endless joy, surely?

9299 2018-02-26 01:57:32 Olive/coconut oil, half a bag of cheddar. Same thing, basically.
9300 2018-02-26 01:57:28 esos últimos dos son on the thicker side por su antioxidant content, pero absorben bien en la piel. si vas a usar oil based products, debes press them into your skin inb4 moisturizer. tea tree oil es bueno para point-treat breakouts, no en toda la cara.
9301 2018-02-26 01:57:26 The cosmetic argan oil is very rich in vitamin E

9307 2018-02-26 01:56:40 Really... i don’t know what I’m missing. I was so bored in this film. Annihilation,  never read the book and had no expectation... but critics seem to love it. Oil rainbow palate mess of cgi lensflares.
9308 2018-02-26 01:56:39 Cooked a chili/pasta dish with no added salt and almost no oil... And it was fine. Idk why the heck American food has all this sodium in it.
9309 2018-02-26 01:56:32 I don’t know about that brand but I think most veganaise is basically just emulsified canola oil

9315 2018-02-26 01:55:54 Dude gotta put his BigPharma and Oil money somewhere
9316 2018-02-26 01:55:53 Btw I don’t, (nor Quiggin) necessarily agree this is how governments work, more how MMTists think they ought to. In 2014 both the price of oil and the sanctions caused huge moves in their exchange rates, which contributed to inflation.
9317 2018-02-26 01:55:50 Im glad i checked my vehicle fluids today.  The antifreeze was half full  in the radiator.   Changing the oil layer this week.
9318 2018-02-26 01:55:43 Why should a manufacturer be liable for the illegal or improper usage of their product? You could take a lot of items, whether it's a vehicle, knife, fertilizer+fuel oil, or even a Boeing 787, and use it to ILLEGALLY kill someone.

9332 2018-02-26 01:53:49 CBD oil is not pot of course. We should be studying this all first! Need to get rid of schedule 1 designation for sure. But if it's gonna be a medicine - which is may very well - let's study it like all other medicines.

9336 2018-02-26 01:52:51 Have to admit it takes a special kind of snake oil salesman to take a $200M inheritance, turn it into an $8Billion debt and still be able to fool the poorly educated that he’s THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PERSON ON THIS AND ANY PLANET.....and by special I mean vile of course

9460 2018-02-26 01:33:30 I also use honey and olive oil deep conditioning monthly.  Honey helps keep my fine hair very moisturized.  I mix manuka honey in all my products
9461 2018-02-26 01:33:22 Jonesy's paws got cracked, so we coated her in olive oil, which is apparently another thing she likes to eat. Her mother is not impressed.

9464 2018-02-26 01:32:37 This is just me personally but I can accept a wide variety of opinions. You like Sanders? Fine drive the EV or one that runs off recycled corn oil. Whatever it is....be consistent in your beliefs. People loving Xi because they hate Trump is just beyond the pale to me

ขอบคุณมากๆค่า
9466 2018-02-26 01:32:18 And the brawls between ducks and oil. Such a good rivalry
9467 2018-02-26 01:32:13 I bought a bottle of castro oil at Shoppers Drug Mart (Canada) for $4.99. It works the same as a laxative, it tightens surface muscle and pushes black heads out. I don't have any reaction to it
9468 2018-02-26 01:32:12 Ooh and popcorn popped in olive oil.
9469 2018-02-26 01:32:11 Whale oil beef hooked
9470 2018-02-26 01:31:51 I saw #8 and immediately thought of Siltanen. 

Reinhart wore it last.  Definitely not a number that stands out as memorable for the Oil...aside from Siltanen. 
9471 2018-02-26 01:31:35 put my sheets in the dryer for a few minutes + applied a couple drops of lavender oil. toasty 
9472 2018-02-26 01:31:24 Tylers parents bought me a new tire for my car & got my oil changed for me. Then his mom finished doing the laundry I started. God bless them
9473 2018-02-26 01:31:10 every time i use castor oil for my lashes it irritates my eyes SO BAD no matter what
9474 2018-02-26 01:31:02 And you think Greenpeace does not get huge donations from Big Oil, Coal, and Gas, Wind & Solar ?

They have a yearly budget of 400 Million Dollars !

Same woth other anti nuclear groups even in Oz.

Stop being a hypocrite.
9475 2018-02-26 01:31:01 That’s the oil industry squeezing out their energy competition by using the politicians the bought create such tariffs. This isn’t hard.
9476 2018-02-26 01:30:59 Palm oil doesn't have the stability issues of corn oil, but I wouldn't wager it's optimal, even though SFA.
9477 2018-02-26 01:30:58 deep condition it once a week to keep the moisture and oil it everyday.
9478 2018-02-26 01:30:53 Had to go look again. Suddenly I need lots of coconut oil

9480 2018-02-26 01:30:50 Do you have dry skin? Try to moisturize right out of the shower. Pat your skin dry allowing some moisture to remain, then apply oil or cream
9481 2018-02-26 01:30:43 Keep forgetting to get coconut oil 
9482 2018-02-26 01:30:41 i’ve had this car for over a year and this is my first time having to get anything besides an oil change and tune up done so i’m grateful.
9483 2018-02-26 01:30:39 Do you carry 1:1 cannabis oil ? I was interested in ordering some eventually but wasn't sure if you carry it or not.
9484 2018-02-26 01:30:38 convinced that coconut oil is the answer to almost everything

9494 2018-02-26 01:29:36 We fought and lost our lives, sacrificed ourselves for what was right on foreign soil. Not for oil or gas. Today, again, we see Syria slaughtering children and broken people using sarin gas again.Evil backed by Russia and Iran. Trump betraying us for power and $$$. He’s no hero.

9508 2018-02-26 01:27:14 the difference between Santorum and Emu oil?
9509 2018-02-26 01:26:55 Also, they produce coconut, but I don't think much oil is processed on those islands; it requires more scale. Tallow and vegetable seed oils are main fats
9510 2018-02-26 01:26:39 yeah!! she was actually explaining to me that alligator pear is the more common way of referring to it in Taiwan but cow oil fruit is the more common way of referring to it in China. i think it's pretty interesting...
9511 2018-02-26 01:26:29 In Hackers, i thought it was cool how all of the hackers could band together in preventing the oil tankers from capsizing so easily. Not sure how applicable that is to real hacking but hacking to me seems pretty powerful and scary, especially in the world we live in now.
9512 2018-02-26 01:26:18 i have! im currrently using the ordinary's niacinamide and rosehip seed oil :) which of their products are you interested in?
9513 2018-02-26 01:26:18 Why should there be a managed decline? Most global markets are in the process of pricing carbon. There is a very good chance that the AB Climate Leadership Plan will help make oil sands crude cost and carbon-competitive for many decades to come. Why mess with that?

9523 2018-02-26 01:25:14 I go to shops in Auckland where Pasifika families shop, unique mix of foods - lots of white starch - cabin bread (who else eats that?), noodles, rice, lots of cheap vegetable oil, tinned coconut cream, tinned fish, no palm oil except in processed food, coconut oil only for skin.
9524 2018-02-26 01:25:11 I’m sitting under the dryer and some olive oil just dripped from my ear . In that moment I knew I put too much lol

9530 2018-02-26 01:23:52 Tzeporah, with all respect, if you say the oil sands are too expensive to be cost-competitive, you don't what the hell you're talking about. SAGD production costs are between $20 and $30/b. Cash costs are down around $7 to $10. Oil sands can compete with US shale in most cases.
9531 2018-02-26 01:23:51 I’m bout to baby oil my body up and take a profile pic with my shirt off. Always wondered what’s that like.

9533 2018-02-26 01:22:19 @Hyundai my vehicle: I contacted Hyundai and told them I was at a Repair Shop and the owner Diagnosed my vehicle, removed the cover from underneath oil and pieces of metal started coming from the car. He said those were parts of the bearings that had broken off the motor.
9534 2018-02-26 01:22:13 Consider an analogy. When you start a car, the battery, oil or handbrake or such indicator light on dashboard may remain red even after ignition if any of those things are wrong. The correct way to solve it is to solve the underlying problem. Wrong way is to blow out that light.

9566 2018-02-26 01:17:27 What the article downplayed.  Denmark is a huge oil exporter.  That revenue pays for a lot of socialism.  Demark keeps out non Europeans.  Danish society like most of Europe, tolerates little variance from social norms and thoughts.  I would suffocate there.  Even with my wallet.

9583 2018-02-26 01:14:21 You have incentives on electric vehicles because people are not buying electric vehicles so they have to give them a rebate in order for people to buy them. Why does it have to do with oil companies? The consumer is the problem. Conservation is the answer.

9610 2018-02-26 01:10:55 That thinks raising 2 billion for a campaign is not corruption and aparently also believes corruption is ok if its legalised... The us is corupted at Every level of government thats why oil companys roam free and guns Stay unrestricted...

9623 2018-02-26 01:09:11 How far would big oil go-to silence someone with a crazy alternative fuel idea like magnetic compression?
9624 2018-02-26 01:08:57 As a fellow beardo, that's a nice-looking rug!
Do you use any oil/conditioner?
9625 2018-02-26 01:08:25 A break for about a month, liquid collagen, a good liquid vitamin with biotin and any kind of oil on the nails will do
9626 2018-02-26 01:08:14 Coconut oil
Jojoba 
Avocado
9627 2018-02-26 01:07:57 @skinnation_ for my heels should I use the coconut oil or the miracle potion? Thank you. Love your prodcuts. I am a cadet..yay

9630 2018-02-26 01:07:33 Haha, okay! The brands that I’ve tried are OGX coco oil shampoo/conditioner. Cantu leave-in, shea Moisturizer Shampoo/conditioner, and today I just tried As I Am Cowash and I fell in love with that.

9632 2018-02-26 01:07:05 @surfinchef61 i hope your CBD oil sales are going good. It's awesome for my pain as an anti-inflammatory
9633 2018-02-26 01:06:55 Interesting to re-see that Getzlaf-threatening-Sekera clip from Game 1 in lght of Getz later putting Sek out of the series. I had forgotten about that previous incident. 

Nothing much to win for the Oil tonight,but the Ducks needing the 2 points should be motivation enough.
9634 2018-02-26 01:06:46 I need some coconut oil and cocoa butter
9635 2018-02-26 01:06:39 Also, don’t forget that Timothy McVeigh killed 168 and injured 680 with fertilizer and fuel oil in Oklahoma City and the 9/11 hijackers killed 2,996 with airliners. Somehow, I was able to buy a pressure cooker with no background check after the Boston Marathon bombing. Go figure!
9636 2018-02-26 01:06:05 psa from the (self proclaimed) vitamins and supplements guru:

if you have dry, patchy, shitty skin from your eating habits, start taking flax seed oil pills. it takes a few weeks to notice anything but it even helps skin conditions like psoriasis and eczema.

9642 2018-02-26 01:05:33 Use jojoba oil, I learned in school it’s one of the only nails that penetrates the nail bed, and helps nail grow stronger
9643 2018-02-26 01:04:57 いや、個人的には安いぎゅうぎゅう詰のバスの方が奴隷として運ばれてる感じになるのでそれはそれでいいのですが。
9644 2018-02-26 01:04:23 I agree. Anything that isn't raking in the dough for the FTC needs regulations they can enforce that will! Don't get me started on vaping or CBD oil regulations either...

9651 2018-02-26 01:02:39 Other acceptable option: making the mistake of using truffle oil.

9655 2018-02-26 01:02:27 Canada needs to follow the U.S.example of energy self reliance. Instead of being reliant on foreign oil our government does not have to be bullied by protesters paid by foreign interest that protect their interests of selling their oil to Canada at enormous prices.
9656 2018-02-26 01:02:19 @POTUS Putin helps Trump get in the WH. Trump steals taxpayers’ money though his SCAM tax law. Putin gets to sell more OIL. The taxpayers lose healthcare and pay more taxes. Putin wins, Americans lose. SANCTIONS for Putin!! JAIL for Trump!!

9667 2018-02-26 01:00:42 Vibranium maybe made up, but oil, gold and diamonds are real.....Makes you wonder...
9668 2018-02-26 01:00:20 There's also a lot of manipulation in the oil market. OPEC (Saudis) does it themselves or hires Wall Street investment banks to do it for them
9669 2018-02-26 01:00:15 OIL DIFF: 3.64 -> 3.79
9670 2018-02-26 01:00:12 one time our hs band did some volunteer work for an oil company who was hosting a crawfish boil, and we helped host it and such

9671 2018-02-26 01:00:09 ok but why have I been sleeping on coconut oil 
9672 2018-02-26 00:59:59 A conversation between Shawn and me about his facial hair:

Me: if you really want to try growing it out long, you need to get beard oil. I’ve seen some online.

Shawn: if it’s fairly cheap, order some. Just get me some that smells good...like new car scent or something.
9673 2018-02-26 00:59:58 I'm not saying skip some schools. I do suggest to put that stuff in place first where it appears to be needed most.

9683 2018-02-26 00:59:10 Here's the thing: a metal detector is useless for somebody intent on entering a school with a gun. Unless actively stopped, that person goes on a rampage To stop that you'll need SROs and/or armed teachers.

9696 2018-02-26 00:57:22 In which case you start out with some additional armed SROs, those who've actually seen combat, like veterans, capable of going up against armed opposition, not the type who chickened out in #Parkland.
9697 2018-02-26 00:57:10 Interesting. And one of the highest intakes of saturated fat, palmitic, (not my favorite). 

"Highest intakes were identified in Samoa, Kiribati, and similar palm oil producing island nations..."

9699 2018-02-26 00:56:39 It's very deceptive. Not quite 'hydrogen monoxide scare' levels but pretty disingenuous. Oil is also from ancient wood, for instance!
9700 2018-02-26 00:55:44 ... all the funds wasted in various pork barrels, put them to good use. Don't need no more bridges to nowhere.

9706 2018-02-26 00:53:47 Can someone explain to me why I keep getting emails about cannabis oil?? Like it's at least one email per day and I unsubscribe to all of them  #whyme
9707 2018-02-26 00:53:37 Not too bad... doing things big is pretty common around here. If one wanted to slim that down, having some data where school shootings occur frequently, secure them first, might defray the cost some. It would also be cool to be able to redirect ...

9721 2018-02-26 00:51:42 Every business in Nigeria is lined with scammers. The entire crude oil to finished product chain in Nigeria is ‘one chance’ even within the NNPC.
9722 2018-02-26 00:51:33 Exactly how I feel when watching Supercross races at the Lucas oil off road races with @JeremyMcGrath in his motor home
9723 2018-02-26 00:51:32 Nope, I got more weed butter and olive oil 
9724 2018-02-26 00:51:31 Saudi Arabia has been flooding the market with cheap oil to try and drive US shale oil companies out of business. 
Also you have Iran who after decades of embargo wants to unleash its oil exports. 
So yes there is a glut
9725 2018-02-26 00:51:31 Similar, but i used tomato sauce and diced tomatoes. Also added oregano, red/green bell pepper. And ALOT of garlic. No sugar no oil
9726 2018-02-26 00:51:13 Do you have an unreasonable fear of mustache rides?
9727 2018-02-26 00:51:05 Garlic pepper pork chops done in lemon and truffle oil. Sunday is a good day.

9729 2018-02-26 00:50:41 Problem with that theory is the maintenance. Check what an oil change costs for one. Or a new set of tires.
9730 2018-02-26 00:50:40 I run a very large machine that makes the paper for automotive air filters. Used to make oil filters, then got promoted to machine operator.

9735 2018-02-26 00:50:02 The squeaky wheel gets the oil. But that's getting tiring. And the squeaky wheel isn't necessarily a nice wheel. So all of the other wheels are chiming in for once.

9747 2018-02-26 00:48:57 WHAT!? Girl, lemon juice, some olive oil and salt, it's so simple and good

9761 2018-02-26 00:46:10 It's a blight.  I see it from my window every day.  It must be taken away, just for scrap, before it starts to leak oil in the sensitive Fraser River.

9794 2018-02-26 00:40:41 Zucchini noodles are awesome. You could do a stir fry, too. Our favorite thing to do with them, though, is slice them, spray with olive oil and use a little minced garlic, salt & pepper and then grill them. Simple and delicious.

9800 2018-02-26 00:39:37 All you are doing is making and repeating excuses to allow the #KinderMorgan pipeline to be forced on BC. Oil and gas has nothing to do with gay rights or supporting dictators. It is about protecting the environment against dirty oil. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM

9805 2018-02-26 00:38:30 All I see is Trump promoting oil for Putin's companies & coal & hurting clean energy trying to bankrupt it. You are right about Putin but I don't see Trump doing that yet. Putin robs his people blind & then money launders $$ in democratic countries.
9806 2018-02-26 00:38:29 Oats, steel cut oats, quinoa, puffed brown rice, chia seeds, almonds, cinnamon, and cardamom. For the wet, I blended some dates, coconut oil, tahini (sesame seed butter), vanilla extract, and Himalayan salt. It’s in the oven now, we’ll see how it turns out lol

9841 2018-02-26 00:32:44 Coconut oil can help you moisturize your face. I’ve been using it for a couple days and it’s already starting to take affect.

The USA built 10,000 miles of O+G pipe, exports crude AND LNG, imports our oil cheap so they can do that.   All of that happened under Prez Obama . Only Canada is SO stupid

9877 2018-02-26 00:28:12 Soy sauce does not contain the phytoestrogens you are worried abt. The fermentation process breaks them down. Soybean oil is also okay. The problem is unfermented soy solids in products like soy milk & textured vegetable protein (TVP; it is hidden in a lot of processed foods).

9887 2018-02-26 00:27:09 the best part is that he said, with regard to using oil and natural gas, "...though we can feed the world..." So then, I guess he's a proponent of using these resources for charity, and of programs to help the poor in general? Haha. Has he ever exhorted anything like that?
9888 2018-02-26 00:27:08 Not really. Just had a couple glasses of wine and talking shit. Tyler's cool but not a guy I want to cross!

9896 2018-02-26 00:25:37 If you have natural black hair then it shouldnt be that difficult, might take a couple rounds of bleach and recovering your hair(i use coconut oil) I think, but idk cause i havent had dark hair lol
9897 2018-02-26 00:25:31 I miss my old cooker with a separate grill on top. The grill in the oven just smokes from oil on it and cheese on toast never happens. 
9898 2018-02-26 00:25:15 i dont understand why people are actually against clean energy. sure oil products are awesome if u like ruining the world, but still, what do they expect to do when it runs out? you can't go renewable in a year lmao
9899 2018-02-26 00:25:03 Hell no!!  How many businesses do you know that are raising pay, reinvesting in their businesses???  Not many, I can tell you, except maybe the oil companies.

9902 2018-02-26 00:24:37 #TaxBillScam was a giveaway to himself and extremely wealthy. His attack on welfare and holding DACA back for a senseless wall. Sorry but history unfolding only confirms that #45 is a snake oil salesman. Don’t fall for it Parsha.

9905 2018-02-26 00:23:44 Today has not been a good day for getting food... subway ran out of bread (wtf) and then pizza pizza called me to say they no longer allow extra BBQ sauce on their pizza. And somehow I ended up with a proline ticket. Edmonton, Houston, San Jose $2 x 10.05 odds. Don’t blow it Oil.
9906 2018-02-26 00:23:38 I added hemp oil to my diet and my eczema cleared.
9907 2018-02-26 00:23:35 Well of course it is, just like all of these pesky regulations that protect us from predatory banks, employers, oil companies, chemical companies, you get my drift. This illegitimate president is dismantling all that matters but we will get it back-if we vote Democratic.

9929 2018-02-26 00:20:46 i know it breaks some people out but my skin was insanely oily all the time before i started using coconut oil and it's really the only thing i've found to work the best for me in like 7 years of having acne so, it def works for some people

9937 2018-02-26 00:20:15 When venezuelan president says and affirms Pdvsa has the capacity to recover 70% of its oil production this year reminds me the former Ramirez era when back in 2005 he always fanfared to lift #venezuela production up to 5 million barrels. They keep lying. #oott #oil

9939 2018-02-26 00:20:04 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.

9941 2018-02-26 00:19:26 Sure, but 24 is still near a prospect. They need to look into both. And right now, they have Bensen, Bear, Yamo, etc in prospect pool, among others

9947 2018-02-26 00:18:57 It's actually a tad tough.  I don't have a land line.  Thankfully I have 20 year old son that breaks into his 13 year old sisters phone.  It's crazy.  I mean we had Polaroid and party lines.
9948 2018-02-26 00:18:48 Ohh I didn’t see that. Coconut oil doesn’t affect everyone’s skin but it will cause breakouts in most people. The oil is too big too actually penetrate the skin so it just kinda sits in your pores and blocks them. I’d recommend finding another natural oil alternative!

9980 2018-02-26 00:14:02 Don’t think the Bible tells anyone to rape our land and suck every drop of oil, mine the last chunk of coal, just to make more money for the rich.

9992 2018-02-26 00:11:56 So true! However, Syria was never in the Soviet sphere, as were the other countries such as Chechnya. No, the sanctions have made Putin look elsewhere for oil because the Arctic deal was killed by the sanctions. Putin had been counting on that deal. Getting it back is his goal!
9993 2018-02-26 00:11:46 Erdo sided with terrorists and allowed 500,000 terrorists from 90 countries transition his country to fight the Syrian government and what the duck is he blabbing about? He also bought cheap oil stolen by those very same terrorists from Syria and Iraq getting rich off it.
