54 2018-04-12 23:29:35 Not sure, depends on how much stuff you want to carry. Note the capacities are with it fully expanded up, so the 30 isn’t 50% bigger all the time, it just can potentially hold that much stuff. Look for a local store that stocks them and try it on.

89 2018-04-12 23:04:13 They do say that retail is making a return... But i would argue that stocks like $nke are selling direct to consumer.
The short float scares me though.
90 2018-04-12 23:03:50 I absolutely believe that bump stocks should be banned, and we should already have a database to record and store information of gun sales and background checks. If these things have flaws, they need to be improved. Mental health needs to be addressed in this country.

115 2018-04-12 22:42:46 The banks will be releasing Q1 earnings reports tomorrow and there will be massive profits. Donald will take credit. His little stunt earlier in the week was likely to dip Goldman and Wells Fargo stocks so his buds can buy in a bit cheaper. It's a rinse repeat scenario.

126 2018-04-12 22:31:39 @bukolasaraki if some concerned experts come together and produced a working bill draft that would seek to enable Nigerians trade foreign stocks and access financial opportunities without discrimination, is that something you and fine senators would give an audience in plenary?

133 2018-04-12 22:24:43 I think its logical to say that what we have experienced in many of our stocks for the past many months were BMIC ALPS diluting all they could before they are shut down.  We should be able to have a stronger OTC moving forward.
134 2018-04-12 22:24:26 Criminals have AR-15 and bump stocks and bullet proof vests. In denial and naive much?
135 2018-04-12 22:23:02 Lets hope now that the the Dilution regulations are about to change in our favor, that we will see an ease on all stocks
136 2018-04-12 22:21:48 I say no to bump stocks on knives.

150 2018-04-12 22:13:06 Get out of stocks now. Overdue for a 20% correction, based on volatility (VIX)  and the 200 day moving average. Market correction mostly likely next 60 days.
151 2018-04-12 22:10:34 There's a lag between tax cut and revenue increase. Sorry, not everything happens instantly, even in this economy. 

Stocks that went up during Obama years: green energy, textbook/test publishers, medical record data, HC insurance. All directly tied to Obama's Big Government.
152 2018-04-12 22:10:20 Well not really. Given that the present volatility is directly related to the realisation that interest rates increases are now coming, Corporate and Government Bonds are going to be directly impacted, and the"Free Money" for stock buybacks, driving the Markets (stocks and

157 2018-04-12 22:06:12 Someone could've sold at a bargain loads of stocks to made up ID's, like Well's Fargo accounts, and then repurchase them when the prices went up. Where's the regulation? I don't think no one here has ever read Securities (Exchange) Act (CFR) § 230, where are the rules?

183 2018-04-12 21:48:17 8000 stocks in the market.  Why buy an airline?  They’re pigs and btw $DAL   Missed on top line.  Got dragged in a strong tape.  Look at the intraday.
184 2018-04-12 21:45:55 WTF??? “Congressional Budget Office projected that the national debt will nearly equal the nation's GDP by 2028.”

On tax breaks for CEO & companies so that they only pay 20% & can buy back their stocks.

While the rest of us go on paying sky high taxes!? 
185 2018-04-12 21:45:37 I learned at #iphs18 this week that pigs don’t like red lights either - a speaker said he has painting bulbs red to stop pigs from lying in that area of the pen
186 2018-04-12 21:44:58 I mean, require that guns not be readily made fully auto. And ban crank triggers and bump stocks. I think we agree fundamentally. So do most liberals. We all think strong background checks, banning some of the crazy accessories, and other steps to limit those with bad intentions

271 2018-04-12 21:00:04 That's a great Q. I suppose, each presenter, be it from @IBDinvestors or @MarketSmith, is going to offer some slightly different strategy on entering back into #stocks after a follow-through. My view: You buy one stock at a time, that's prudent at first
272 2018-04-12 20:59:25 @realDonaldTrump the stock market needs to stop trending downwards!!! you look at the stock market it is negative for year 2018. Those that bought stocks in january 2018 are underwater

276 2018-04-12 20:56:57 Non-hedge funds (public funds) are extremely limited in what they can do.  Traditionally they could only buy and hold stocks and bonds.  No derivatives, currencies, commodities, real estate, etc.  that’s evolved, blurring the lines a little.

282 2018-04-12 20:49:23 In this case, IBD founder Bill O'Neil's book, "How To Make Money In Stocks" states that cup bases typically show a minimum decline of 12% from head to toe. That coincides w/ the flat base rule: a stock cannot correct more than 10% to 15%. Hence, potential overlap

286 2018-04-12 20:46:08 Most of our Salmon stocks are depressed now..so you've done a great job 'standing up for them' so far....Sounds like just using them as yet another excuse to try to kill an oil project. The existing tankers/pipeline didnt kill the salmon off.
287 2018-04-12 20:45:40 Doesn’t have to be stocks. An investment could be anything. You could make a small fortune flipping houses, opening a business, etc. 2 mil give you so much room to live comfortable and take risks with huge payouts.

296 2018-04-12 20:38:23 Yes but no obligation to visit the site. This is always forgetting, like Saddam. Weapons inspectors concluded years ago that Assad had destroyed his CW program and stocks. So like Saddam we have to ignore the official. For the unproven accusations.

301 2018-04-12 20:36:27 Pls beware the pump & dump plays. It’s a terrible habit to get into playing these. Sure, some have longer term investing merit, but flips driven by chat/tweets is something (much less) different. #Stocks #Investing
302 2018-04-12 20:36:06 here's the crux: housing is an investment vehicle, like buying/selling stocks. Banks worldwide pay low or no interest on deposits. Stock, commodities markets are volatile. Housing seems like safest best for return on risk capital. Great for money laundering too

315 2018-04-12 20:30:06 Yes because of villager’s lack of kill confirms he will have to do more work. But his kill options still have lots of raw power that allow villager to take early stocks off of a few neutral/advantage wins. He does need better matchup spreads, but I still think he’s in the top 50%

328 2018-04-12 20:22:24 These stocks have upside but all require significant amount of $ to get into production. Acc to Micheal emery at euroz brokerage banerman requires $675m in capex,vmy 383m$ goviex 340$m.  Better bets IMHO are UUUU which requires much less capex and benefits from Sec 232
329 2018-04-12 20:22:09 How do you figure that out? Surely the removal of the 'moderating' influence will drop water temperatures (at least over Scotland) - lead to colder winters and increase cod stocks (they thrive in colder water)?

332 2018-04-12 20:19:43 World stocks generally higher, recovering yesterday's losses: US +.8%; Europe +.7%. Momentum catalyzed by earnings would be on the upside if it weren't for political & trade concerns. Tweet risk will not go away nor volatility. Avoid short-term moves & stick to long-term plan.
333 2018-04-12 20:19:39 I took a little profit around 480 and immediately regretted it even though it’s 10% lower.  I rarely buy back into stocks TUNE maybe the exception

348 2018-04-12 20:10:47 Individual stocks, index funds, EFT's, mutual funds, real estate (personal, land or rental property), precious metals for liquidity (small %), cash or money market funds for liquidity (small %) & any other appreciable asset. If you cannot afford real estate, research REITs.
349 2018-04-12 20:10:33 Even among the up names a lot of stocks were up much less than the average
350 2018-04-12 20:10:06 There have been no laws proposed, by anyone, to take guns away. And there shouldn't. I don't think it's unreasonable to ban bump stocks. I don't thinks it's unreasonable to have universal background checks. I don't think it's unreasonable to raise the age from 18 to 21.
351 2018-04-12 20:10:02 This is also the time I look at the market, check movements, draw patterns, see what I can bet on later. I also sometimes place buy or sell orders. I look at the reco stocks of our trader but funny how I sell when the reco is to buy, and I buy when the reco is to sell.

368 2018-04-12 20:04:41 It's a great thing if looking at stocks through a microscope. Bad thing if you're concerned about future earnings power when nobody is confident to invest in the core business. 

Also, sentiment shifts pretty fast on the efficacy of buybacks once your stock drops 25%.

576 2018-04-12 18:26:00 Trumpy not even caught up with Obama in jobs.  Try a new line.

577 2018-04-12 18:25:55 It doesn't make sense to be short stocks right here, right now.

So much evidence building for a very nice move higher in stocks from here.
578 2018-04-12 18:25:42 Is the headline later today going to be “Stocks move higher on Possible Syria attacks?
579 2018-04-12 18:25:17 Works different here. If the valuation of your stocks, options, and now crypto is over a limit you have to pay taxes for it. You can 'forget' to declare it, but in that case you cannot declare also the capital losses next year.

785 2018-04-12 16:37:34 Done 11 deals on the stocks today waiting on one more to fall in my favour then get my bonus 50 pound for getting a 100 trader points not a bad day 
786 2018-04-12 16:37:25 I don't. the bumps stocks yes. I do think there should be an age limit on them. Again, that's me personally. I don't get the need for them, but again, that's just me. I don't see them for hunting. My dad hunted. Didn't use one. Wouldn't use one.

820 2018-04-12 16:25:17 And despite our budgetary dysfunction, interest rates are still historically low. Investors are shunning bond markets for better returns in the stock market.

848 2018-04-12 16:09:37 STOCKS:  The stock market is wild.  Up today after a down day yesterday.  I'm not holding any stocks until we get closer to the November elections.  Too risky for me.
849 2018-04-12 16:09:08 I agree on misses. But there's a decent chance the familiar "sell the good news" response for those that beat won't be strong this time given two-thirds of all stocks at least 10% off their high.

960 2018-04-12 15:13:32 The reason I asked that question is because years ago I held some restricted stocks as part of a profit sharing I participated in years earlier.

969 2018-04-12 15:10:01 Yeah that’s true, but investments (especially in stocks) take a long time to profit off of & they aren’t always guaranteed. So in that case, slow and steady would still require for you to have a longer life expectancy in order to see those pay outs.

1189 2018-04-12 13:45:09 It is best if people can take care of their stocks when IPO is involved. It's too bad if they haven't, but worse if you were put in prison, and 10 years have passed, yet everyone is trying to make a profit from your stocks by selling them. This should not be a matter of politics.

1332 2018-04-12 12:37:41 @jimcramer Jim , what do you think about investing in UK companies , the brexit took down prices of some good companies and with the US stocks rattled from all the uncertainty of tariffs etc. I am really looking at the UK to put my money into
1333 2018-04-12 12:37:28 And most of the time you tip you have bought and are looking to sell on a quick rise ..otherwise your portfolio would be of 1m stocks!! Lol
1334 2018-04-12 12:36:20 As I've said twice now I have amended my comment.i don't know that you take part in placings so I apologise for my initial comment ..however it's my belief they you do as you continually tip placing stocks!!

If U dont ever sell U wont ever make any money if all U do is buy stocks but were on about something totally different here. You said I took #TOM placing & I said I dont do placings, simple as.

1350 2018-04-12 12:29:54 Sorry,ok it's my opinion (not fact!!) that you or a mate buys in the placing..you're  no fool so why pay more in market when you can get in on placings? U seem to buy a lot of stocks that have just had placings within hours or days
1351 2018-04-12 12:29:33 Good luck with the draft! I pray that favor falls into your decisions that the right player will be drafted to bring immediate results for the sky!
1352 2018-04-12 12:29:32 Well, when I innocently pointed out that the stocks are up since the article was posted, Austen got aggressive (as he is with other comment-ers) so I corrected him.  When he continued, I figured he's stubborn or has an agenda. Read both our feeds - see who's aggressive.
1353 2018-04-12 12:29:18 Phil has been covering Leeds for a long time, mate. They've been bigger laughing stocks than this.
1354 2018-04-12 12:29:05 Reaction day prior to the real start of PEAK earnings. Stocks up today and possibly early tomorrow, maybe to 2676 on the S&P.  This will provide a big sell  from a timing standpointmake. Flattening Yield curve is the barometer.

1375 2018-04-12 12:20:57 You honestly just talk smack, you don’t actually research, why don’t you do yourself a favour and research more than just a headline from @linewiper both of you are pushing stocks that you are involved in and bashing stocks you aren’t in

1381 2018-04-12 12:18:25 That's a difficult one. I know many people like to chase momentum but I think that is very difficult in reality and creates a Strategy-biased Portfolio. If I see value in something I'm very patient - other Stocks will do the running while I wait.

1418 2018-04-12 11:52:03 Good write-up Josh. Yes very hard to trade, even hold stocks in this market, with the backdrop of several potential headline risk events coming true. I think until these are removed and or resolved we are in no-mans land.

1448 2018-04-12 11:30:44 Today, trading in newly listed stocks started at 10:00AM. Earlier it used to start at 9:15 AM. Is there any change in listing timings for sme stocks or is there any technical glitch at @NSEIndia (NSE EMERGE)?
1449 2018-04-12 11:30:42 @UBS In a more volatile environment, we expect solid corporate fundamentals to help underpin equities, which in our view will grind higher. We remain overweight global equities, of which US stocks make up the largest share, while maintaining hedges against tail risks. #equities
1450 2018-04-12 11:29:56 @UBS Further stocks volatility related to trade frictions is likely. But with the US first quarter earnings season about to get underway, we expect investors to start refocusing on the fundamentals, which are likely to support equities. #forex #fx #stocks #stock #equities
1451 2018-04-12 11:28:42 Read my first tweet (again, again): I don't necessarily think acting 'NOW' is a good thing. I *also* want proof, and a plan. 

*If* we have those two conditions, I support limited action against CW stocks and infrastructure.

I don't support Trump or May 'in general'.

OK?

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

1720 2018-04-12 07:39:52 And then of course there's the glaringly obvious point that there was probably no chemical attack in the first place, and if there was it was the so-called "moderate" rebels.

2032 2018-04-12 02:58:53 He legally bought his weapons AND his bump stock, and THAT is why 58 innocent Americans are DEAD, and over 850 are wounded. This is why we need bump stocks and assault weapons banned. Otherwise, this will predictably happen again and again.

2035 2018-04-12 02:56:26 The Parkland shooter didn't use a bump stock. The LV shooter did. After that shooting, Trump did nothing. He ONLY began to move to ban bump stocks after coming under intense pressure by the #MarchForOurLives movement. BTW, @NRA opposes a ban on bump stocks, which is disgusting.

2072 2018-04-12 02:41:48 That depends on how you measure. If you increase something $100 a day, that percentage of increase gets smaller every day. That's how people say Obama increased the stocks more. It was record low growth. I experienced it as a new college grad with jobs drying up.

Maybe if you put a burst or two on target you might land a wide grouping. Holding down for 30 rounds isn’t like COD. Muzzle climb will pull off target.

2159 2018-04-12 01:34:58 These are your priorities right now? Stocks down another 218 points today, Russia threatening us, Cohen about to flip and this is what you choose as a distraction.
2160 2018-04-12 01:34:08 Sure...I'll watch the lunatic lefties lose their minds 

I've invested in stocks that benefit from lemmings in chaos mode...my IRA is crushing it these days
2161 2018-04-12 01:34:01 No silly they are sporting a new look Khaki cargo shorts and polos... and no more big stocks wrapped in cloth with scary gasoline dipped tips .... they have #tikitorches approved by the #NFPA isnt modern day bigotry just awesome...
2162 2018-04-12 01:33:53 At least the stocks are on break huh.
2163 2018-04-12 01:32:43 It has over 1 billion O/S... only way you see .50+ is with a reverse split. To big of a float, it’s a lot like DCTH, just gonna be typical pump and dump.
2164 2018-04-12 01:30:58 I’m going to buy some penny stocks.....

Go on offense!
RAID-Mueller's offices
SEC Violations
INSIDE TRADING ALLEGATIONS!

Day trading staffers?
Knowledge about news releases

Money being made?
Does Mueller trade stocks?
Do his Attorneys?
Do his Staffers?

ALL CRIMINALS?
ALL ABOVE THE LAW?

RAID THEM!
TONIGHT!
2166 2018-04-12 01:30:11 Okay some time in the next couple weeks will join for a week  . Too busy trading my own ideas right now. Trade mostly Canadian stocks but always interested in making $$$  I guess go to web site and all pretty strait forward -even for an old guy like me cheers and thanks
2167 2018-04-12 01:29:53 Wonder who's buying the most stocks? Bet most are connected to the GOP.
2168 2018-04-12 01:26:01 @SpeakerRyan : since you have nothing to lose now, please do your job.  Get common sense gun control passed - Universal background checks, ban assault weapons and bump stocks, correct the tax plan disaster, and leave SS and Medicare alone!
2169 2018-04-12 01:25:53 SIN stocks?
2170 2018-04-12 01:25:12 Not to mention the “insider information” he has access to - and can freely buy stocks....and become wealthy. SENATORS make a lot of $$$$$$$$ in this process it is NOT illegal for politicians but is ILLEGAL for private citizens - think Martha Stewart

Hmm, should put money in microwave company stocks.

2173 2018-04-12 01:22:45 That wasn’t a jab at you, it was a jab at TA. But as for your chart, you’re correct, stocks went down. Anyone arguing that is either lacking corrective lenses or a brain.
2174 2018-04-12 01:21:13 Decades ago, a lot of people said that about stocks. Now they’re considered “investments.”
2175 2018-04-12 01:21:04 Cheeky.... but fact remains, minutes came out and stocks went down. Those are the facts. Fell free to interpret as you wish
2176 2018-04-12 01:20:29 Just made my first official legitimate investments in mutual funds & stocks  today  I wish I’ve done this long ago. Now let time do it’s thing  growing old is somethin to look forward to 
2177 2018-04-12 01:18:17 Morning Note - US Stocks declined due to geopolitical tensions and the latest gauge of U.S. inflation. #ASX 200 fell 0.5% to 5828.7 as further strong gains by resource stocks failed to counter broad weakness and a pullback by the major banks. #marketsovernight

2179 2018-04-12 01:17:43 After watching Empire sipping some green tea and enjoying some down time, wondering what stocks will do in the final two trading days of the week?

2188 2018-04-12 01:10:05 had a lengthy discussion with an accounting student who firmly believes investing on stocks is just a fool's errand. I'll write down some of his ideas and expand on my thoughts regarding them in a tweet chain.
2189 2018-04-12 01:09:10 @Bill_Morneau I ask pm if he and his  cabinet would disclose what stocks they hold in any oil companies?
I also asked if the liberals would insure that liberals would clean up any oil spills ?
So what about you?
2190 2018-04-12 01:08:50 If Facebook ever crashes ..... looool all other major social media sites stocks go through the roof. The rich just get richer

2193 2018-04-12 01:06:51 does facebook has stocks? cos if theres any, i would like to buy some. this kind of situation they are dealing wt is an opportunity 
2194 2018-04-12 01:05:43 Oh ok. So just financial shenanigans, story stocks, and early internet? Just Mallaby could handle all of that :)
2195 2018-04-12 01:05:12 Looks like stocks are going to go up in the Private Jail Sector, they might even have to let some of the innocent black guys go
2196 2018-04-12 01:04:09 So why did Zuck sell off his FB stocks before the sh1t hit the fan??? Because he knows he is guilty???
2197 2018-04-12 01:02:26 That's my point. Its not a one off in certain communities. Thats why the cell camera has changed the game. But we are waaay off topic now. At least we agreed on bump stocks and magazine capacity's.Thats what I mean by finding the middle. Good discussion. Have a nice dinner!
2198 2018-04-12 01:02:12 $SPY Why do I get the feeling that I'm going to hear about how stocks have to go down, all the way up? (likely) Just sayin  :)
2199 2018-04-12 01:01:33 this may be all in he and Putin’s plans to boost their stock portfolios this year. 
Steel and Petroleum stocks would only go up during a war. 

Until of course we bomb civilization into oblivion and the $ has no more value because consumerism died with the air and water quality

2203 2018-04-12 00:57:48 This is a poorly educated tweet. Assault is a verb not a noun, so there’s no such thing as an assault weapon. 

Bump stocks are irrelevant, bump fire can be achieved with any semi automatic rifle or handgun.

I suggest you actually do research on what is rabid fire. #gunsense #2A

2219 2018-04-12 00:36:29 They are ignorant about what characterizes a military automatic weapon, what a hi powered rifle is, why anyone who shoots accurately laughs at bump stocks as well as having a misunderstanding of the 2A. They can never win the debate cause they don't learn the subject. Tools.

2229 2018-04-12 00:28:50 Hey @CalSTRS & @CalPERS! I support @CalTreasurer's initiative to divest from companies that make and sell bump stocks and similar dangerous accessories that can turn a semi-automatic weapon into an automatic one! #DivestForOurLives #DefundGuns #DrainTheNRA
2230 2018-04-12 00:25:49 Trade is complex. In a trade war, inflation can spike (raising costs 4 all), stocks get jolted & racial animosity can go up. #Diplomacy 2/2

2235 2018-04-12 00:19:48 Correct on Class 3 license. Personal experience. Also. You don't need bump stocks, or much sophistication, to turn semi-auto assault rifles of certain makes, into fully automatic. Less skill than needed to change lawnmower spark plugs.
2236 2018-04-12 00:19:10 Can’t watch what stocks did you trade?
2237 2018-04-12 00:18:46 Apparently, I know a lot more about stocks and other finance things, thanks to billionaire romance novels. Lol.
2238 2018-04-12 00:17:51 This is already the case. Typically you choose a portfolio, but you can choose individual stocks as well. I mean, if someone has access to your 401k I suppose they could drain it, but I'm fairly certain 401ks are insured against this.
