40 2019-04-20 23:33:24 But this report data is only coming from google search. It is not vigilante but more or reaction by community when there live stocks are stolen. 1-2 cases may be the actual one but all aren’t vigilante or lyncing cases.
41 2019-04-20 23:32:45 Central bankers have created this level of complacency. It is very sad indeed. People believe that stocks should never go down.
42 2019-04-20 23:32:14 CALPERS owns $1 Billion of JP Morgan Chase & Bank of America. They own $300 mil of Walmart & hundreds of other stocks/bonds. Should those UNION members be against the CORPORATE Agenda funding their RETIREMENT????

44 2019-04-20 23:30:43 Wow, the same amount of money can be bought government bind which gives you 800k annual return every year. Or you can buy some bluechip stocks assuming it growing 10% annually, you'll have 27,23 millions in your hand after 10 yrs.
45 2019-04-20 23:29:43 Another, more worrisome reason may be that low volatility stocks are “bond proxies” and benefited from secularly falling interest rates. Will be interesting to see how low vol stocks due in period of flat to rising rates.

54 2019-04-20 23:14:40 Ok, I'll say just one thing :

#Saas stocks are trading at these valuations on the hope of future growth/high net retention rates.

What will happen in the next downturn, when IT spending stops or slows down? Do you think these stocks will still trade at 20,30,50 times revenue?
55 2019-04-20 23:13:19 Barron's was out negative on biotech for next 18 months through 2020 election. Going to need M&A, some big breakthroughs, and the right stocks in one's portfolio to do even okay. Sector is out of favor big time.

69 2019-04-20 22:58:40 1/ over the years I have developed a list of rules regarding stocks to avoid.  Not saying that these won't go up, just that they're not for me.  However, most of the rules came about for a reason.  I invite you to add your own.
70 2019-04-20 22:58:36 Today, many claim that (because of recurring revenues) #SaaS stocks are different and they won't go down in the next bear-market.

Utilities also have recurring revenues/they aren't cyclical, yet in the previous two recessions, the Dow Jones Utilities Average declined by 50-65%!
71 2019-04-20 22:58:34 Imagine holdign no google or amazon stocks...
72 2019-04-20 22:58:32 X: I own stocks.
Y: You have no idea what they're worth.
X: I know my account balance.
Y: That's just mark-to-market. There's no price discovery in stocks or bonds. No one has any sense what they're really worth.
X: But, I have my balance.
Y: Yes.
Y: For now.
73 2019-04-20 22:55:54 No, not at all. It’s fundamentally a different business though, so looking to peak P/S of popular .com stocks isn’t a great reason to sell this basket. It’s important to watch valuation, but the recurring nature of revenue and huge growth rates changes to view valuation.
74 2019-04-20 22:55:25 The stocks was alright but Jesus this is a depressing series of photos 
75 2019-04-20 22:55:07 I have a question..dangerous I know! 

Is it that same in every country that everyone races to the supermarkets and stocks up like the world is ending, because it’s shut for one day?! #easterweedend
76 2019-04-20 22:54:59 If stocks and equity funds are a part of one's risk profile then getting informed is next. Your broker should aid in that process but info is on the JSE site and in both major newspapers.
77 2019-04-20 22:51:46 And stocks the judicial system with corrupt judges.
78 2019-04-20 22:51:37 
"Mazzucato
Business investment in US is now around its lowest level for more than sixty years even though profits have been rising for over 4 decades: extracted from real economy,all directly to shareholders >the wealthiest 10% of households that own 84% of all stocks"5*/

79 2019-04-20 22:48:51 So you are saying that just because Saas revenues are recurring, these stocks should be bought at any valuation and they'll always go up?
80 2019-04-20 22:48:50 Problem is Stocks fall way more than 20%
81 2019-04-20 22:48:06 Peter Schiff has always trashed Jim Cramer at every opportunity. Also listening to Cramer’s advice actually grows wealth where Peter Schiff is a wealth destroyer. Cramer called the “generational bottom 
in stocks” meanwhile Peter Schiff was screaming for economic Armageddon.
82 2019-04-20 22:48:03 Next, what one invests in is dependent on their risk return profile. So stocks aren't actually for everyone. People that are risk averse should invest in passive low risk funds. The higher the return one wants the higher the risk they must take.
83 2019-04-20 22:48:00 So the seals don't deplete their fish stocks. They think they have the right to kill a species so they can then have more of another species to kill!
84 2019-04-20 22:44:24 Invest in Nigeria stocks
85 2019-04-20 22:44:04 Mangos style is so dope
Even though hes up A stock and high percent with Falco while Axe has 1 stock
Hes still playing as if they both still had 4 stocks 0%
86 2019-04-20 22:43:04 Other businesses, banks, stocks, mutual funds - all of which are ways for other businesses run by other people to get capital to start, grow, provide jobs, and pay taxes.  

Again, the exact opposite of what you were insinuating.
87 2019-04-20 22:42:30 I am a direct descendant of William Bradford and also a guy who spent time in the stocks accused by the Puritans of sexual perversity. His revenge was to get rich and donate money and land to build the first Baptist church in the CT territory, thus putting an end 2 puritan rule!
88 2019-04-20 22:42:16 If you’re worried about over-indulging this Easter, I recommend getting a crippling toothache on Good Friday and managing with painkillers until your dentist reopens on Tuesday, instead of forking out for an emergency dentist. We did not forward plan our stocks of soft food.
89 2019-04-20 22:41:05 I began my career in '98 and still remember the "New Era" sentiment of late '99/early '00. Back then, most were convinced that the internet (TMT) was about to change the world, thus the related stocks were bid up to extreme valuations...
90 2019-04-20 22:38:47 #99 Ryan Raley Jr sets quick time for the Pure Stocks with a 20.388
91 2019-04-20 22:38:00 Stocks are mostly owned by the Silent Generation & Baby Boomers. Millenials will liquidate those stocks and will buy Crypto. I said it here first! A massive wealth transfer 8s about to happen in the next 20 years
92 2019-04-20 22:36:19 Not true.  Depends if u have money or not. Retired or not.  Have stocks.  If u ha e nothing and retires it is about caring for people and not being like trump is.  Women’s rights.  Not taking them away

Pelosi, Nadler, Shiff, and Beto have all made fortunes off of trading stocks! Stocks that if were done by me or you would be considered insider trading!
96 2019-04-20 22:28:31 Was - but a very small amount. I don’t have a lot of money and got into pot stocks way too late. 
I’ve learnt that following people’s advice on twitter can be tricky. Buying power moves the market - buy/pump/sell/run away with profit. This appears to be a trend.
97 2019-04-20 22:27:27 Are there less than a 100 penny stocks?  Then they'll never be less than 100 cryptos.  Starting a new #crypto takes an hour and is virtually free.  Ignore the 99%

100 2019-04-20 22:26:26 .....if someone has wealth, what do they do with it? it's either deposited in the bank, or invested in some sort of asset like stocks, bonds, real estate, an operating business. Then, that capital is used to fund those businesses, create jobs, be available for loans/mortgages...
101 2019-04-20 22:26:03 This is exactly how the stocks after the 2001 dot com bubble bursting played out as well.  The stocks that were the real deal continues to eat market share and the other stocks just disappear after a few years.
102 2019-04-20 22:25:23 Actually, unless you're only buying stocks on the IPO, the corporation gets none of your money. You (a speculator) are buying from another speculator.

110 2019-04-20 22:15:29 If stocks didn’t exist businesses would be about making money to support their employees and single/family owners. Instead of making money for the oligarchy of the 1% that controls the majority of the worlds wealth. Being illegal doesn’t stop people from doing it.
111 2019-04-20 22:15:00 Absolutely. The only way you can make money out of these stocks.

113 2019-04-20 22:12:10 If you hoard your wealth in a bank, that bank will make loans so others can fulfill their dreams.

If you hoard your wealth in stocks, you will enable corporations to expand, invest, hire more people. 

If you hoard your wealth in bonds, you are helping pay for schools, roads.
114 2019-04-20 22:09:41 Which is a felony and puts people in prison when the get caught. You know stocks are the reason we have every major corporation we have and while I hate the rich your life would be vastly different probably for the worse if stocks didn’t exist

133 2019-04-20 21:39:50 I'd say more "quantity" - a poor man like me has to ration their stocks...

135 2019-04-20 21:29:16 other people hit the gym when their girl breaks up with them, my friend wants to start trading stocks and currencies lmao.
136 2019-04-20 21:26:19 I get your point and it’s a valid one but all stocks can’t be checked and confirmed cause you’ve been told not to sell used or fake phones are brand new original product. Always indicate regardless and be open, don’t be about the massive profit but for good name.
137 2019-04-20 21:26:16 I watched a lot of my boomer parents gen burn in 2008. Those who could hold have recovered, a lot didn’t. Precious metals folks, lead, brass, tool steel and cast iron. Stocks...livestocks baby...it’ll be ok, even if the robots don’t come through and give us that all free shit.

A. get with the program or
B. Lose money

Still seeing too many TAs as in all of them choosing to go with B on this one @MustStopMurad @ImprintedENERGY Moon Overlord, @ToneVays you know,who I refer to as the idiots give me money.
142 2019-04-20 21:21:36 The more I stare at it the more investment and speculation are blurred. Cash flow investments are clearly different. But these do not describe most stocks. People with mortgages are engaged leveraged speculation in housing whether they know it or not.

It would allow believers to maybe profit at a different rate based on the market.

190 2019-04-20 20:19:00 Seeing large banks give cannabis stocks price targets will become more common. Just a few weeks ago, Jefferies Financial Group began its first coverage of seven cannabis companies.

I meant to reopen the store this week but some stocks got delayed and only just came in today. A con is also coming up next week so I decided it's best to just launch the store post con so I can focus on it 100%

205 2019-04-20 20:02:58 Sean, the facts don't support your claims.  Fishermen in the UK are allowed to kill seals if they are in "problem areas" and some people in the fisheries industry feel seals are the issue for depleted fish stocks, rather than overfishing and when they shoot them, they're required
206 2019-04-20 20:02:19 Well, w respect to single stocks, technicals are my 3rd input (2nd at best). The above is macro so the explains the fake-out a bit better. Sentiment wise, TSLA is polarized. For every aggressive bear there is a pie in the sky bull. See sentiment here as a wash.

218 2019-04-20 19:45:30 My answer: because I own ravioli stocks.

220 2019-04-20 19:42:15 Investing 101 for imbeciles. Stocks can go down. If you fail to grasp that fact skip to Investing 102 - don’t buy stocks because you’re too slanted to the left of the IQ bell to be bothered understanding what you’re buying.
221 2019-04-20 19:39:15 Agree. But stocks are not going down soon despite inverted yield curve. The Fed will do anything to keep this bubble going on. Just look what happened in Q4/2018. Trump will do anything to keep this going until he is removed from office.

225 2019-04-20 19:24:28 The "because IT DOESN'T really" threw me of. Are you against any Gun laws? If not then there must be some laws you're ok with, like the federal ban on Auto, now how about bump stocks or trigger pullers? How about registration?
226 2019-04-20 19:24:20 Yes, and it's something many do all the time without even realizing it. Like focusing on the handful of stocks that were vastly overpriced but nevertheless did well and saying "See? You're wrong, look at XYZ." 

It's a difficult and pernicious problem.

230 2019-04-20 19:19:57 Stocks, watch them all drop, short them all, exchange your Fiat into #BITCOIN #BTC 

QE1, 2 & 3 have inflated stocks to ridiculous levels, don't Bank on QE4 and if it does come it's likely to be different as 1, 2 & 3 clearly failed.

237 2019-04-20 19:13:37 but when you apply that to a large corp with stocks and board members etc it can be more problematic than useful, companies like netflix don't NEED to lie (but maybe the producer of a new indie series does need it...) especially when it's actually affecting the entire economy

253 2019-04-20 18:56:08 Well, perhaps we could start by defining what is not sensible
--Opposing background checks
--Opposing laws of gun ownership at least as onerous as for driving

Well he already trades stocks & has some nice Swing positions going on
He wants to buy his first house by the time he is 20 and he already has a Tutoring business he started up at 16.
So, I think he is well on his way my friend of being independent and more!

255 2019-04-20 18:53:12 Impeachment is a rather light sentence for this #WindBag 
I'd much prefer he be put on the WHITE HOUSE lawn in Stocks or Pillory as they used in colonial days for criminals until he begs to sign a resignation ..

257 2019-04-20 18:50:37 3/3 additional $1800 on average. Everything, on its face, looks good, once you start pulling at the strings it all unravels showing a much worse condition. The only positive, which I do give him credit for, was the nation-wide ban on bump stocks
258 2019-04-20 18:48:37 I has sweat on   stocks .
259 2019-04-20 18:48:16 It's a major issue, the more you can do to stop it the better. Name and shame then put them it the "stocks" so we can all wave the Highway Code at them and throw rotten fruit.
260 2019-04-20 18:47:47 Both my husband n FiL deal in stocks. But jokers like Tewari who have nothing at stake will not leave any opportunity to mock gullible Indians. Everything is a joke to them.
261 2019-04-20 18:47:00 Half way though your quest I guess the high street stocks are getting low. You could  always bake some!
262 2019-04-20 18:45:43 The rules need to be changed into laws on many fronts like taxes, security, business investments, and stocks. No senator or president should own stocks, they have too much influence.

265 2019-04-19 23:59:35 Contrary to mythos, most soldiers had weapons provided by the town, county, or colony. Minute companies usually owned their own. Colonies kept stocks of weapons and ammo. Powder was the biggest thing.

270 2019-04-19 23:53:35 Market still doesn't understand retail segment. Also, most retail shareholders have short attention span and analyze stocks with hype metric.They are momentum traders running after the next hyped stock. It takes time to reach a stable support level and a fair valuation.

274 2019-04-19 23:50:37 in 2010/2011 two guys I know that were into stocks discouraged me... But also at that time it was difficult to readily buy and setting up mining wasnt easy either... I got in around 100$ in mid 2012
275 2019-04-19 23:50:24 Those weapons have the same functionality other than magazine capacity. They are simply modular so they can be easily modified with different stocks and such. AR-15s are the Jeep of guns.
276 2019-04-19 23:49:21 Most of these algos are not shorting vol: if I trade twice a day on combo of fundamental and price factors with a portfolio long 200 stocks and short 200 stocks. My avg investment duration is max 1 month. I have a beta of 0. How am I short vol?

278 2019-04-19 23:47:57 I took a course about 20 years ago from the Canadian Shareowners Association. They taught graphing of earnings as a way to pick stocks. The two companies they used as examples: Stryker and $BAM . I didn't buy either. Wish I had.

281 2019-04-19 23:39:35 I totally agree w/ you. I remember back in the day w/ the militias, the minutemen, etc....but then there was at least some control over assault rifles & stocks, but now.....oh lord.
282 2019-04-19 23:39:24 Above 290 it will have a rally towards 330. Else range bound from 244-266. Stocks might not rally in general till results so be cautious.
283 2019-04-19 23:37:07 What do you mean by ‘no event’?

312 2019-04-19 23:25:57 @AlanJones so @IzzyFolau is being hounded out of the game and @qantaswallabies executive have probably screwed up his contract and cowered to hypocritical @Qantas.

•Coral reefs are dying. •Sea levels are rising. •We are over fishing and stressing stocks. •Plastic is destroying what lives in and feeds in the ocean. 

That’s just the seas

329 2019-04-19 23:14:55 In those days there were 50 street stocks, 40 late models and 30+ figure 8 cars. After that we’d get 40 Street stocks, 30 American stocks, and 30+ IMCA Modifieds after the price of a dry sump open motor tripled the price overnight and killed open latemodels.

369 2019-04-19 22:34:53 I think you are right.

The key is knowing the stock. Being early and wrong is almost Indistinguishable.

In those areas, rent<<mortgage, so "rent and invest the difference" should be better after considering maintenance, taxes, insurance, etc.

387 2019-04-19 22:11:55 @timseymour Hey Tim, been watching u for years on FM—big fan! Do u think a US China deal could hurt China Tech stocks like BIDU? Reason being the agreement allows US companies (e.g. Google, FB) to freely compete in China w/ out restrictions?
388 2019-04-19 22:10:18 Paully charges clients for extra supplies and stocks his own garage.
389 2019-04-19 22:09:47 Where I’m trying to go with this is that he did an anti republican thing. I don’t support it  and I don’t defend him. He shouldn’t have ban bump stocks. But in comparison with what Democrats are trying to do every single week, thats nothing. They want to ban all guns.
390 2019-04-19 22:08:11 LOL! Yeah. Dirty, coal-smeared faces eating mayonnaise sammiches and selling off their stocks. Lordt.
391 2019-04-19 22:07:24 Or when his wife talked about how they sold stocks when they fell on hard times 
392 2019-04-19 22:06:54 And stocks goes up 5%? Mental market these days
393 2019-04-19 22:06:41 I’m looking forward to the SEC investigation coming your way. When they find you attempted to castrate ABs was economy while buying stocks in competing business...may be you’ll get a cell with a view...pucker-up big boy...
394 2019-04-19 22:05:23 Like us v Fulham. We’ll beat Manu
395 2019-04-19 22:03:03 Smoke stocks
396 2019-04-19 21:59:57 Oh
397 2019-04-19 21:58:00 Thing is, too, Wall Street is using scare tactics implying that impeachment will send stocks plummeting, as if elections and change of power never happens.
398 2019-04-19 21:57:56 or going bankrupt whichever comes first => any investment is a gamble - rolling the dice and hoping it comes up snake eyes. For everyone who makes it rich, there are countless others who failed. The odds are stocks will go up - so the odds in favor rather than spinning roulette.
399 2019-04-19 21:57:50 More ridiculous meddling by the USA in pursuit of oil stocks?????
400 2019-04-19 21:57:03  Half the country doesn’t own stocks so they give 0 f*cks about the stock market. Layoffs are still occurring, folks still working 2 jobs to make ends meet, unaffordable housing &healthcare, can’t pay for an emergency. Income inequality  & deficit soaring. Yep, its all great!
401 2019-04-19 21:55:19 Free Stocks 
402 2019-04-19 21:52:56 Stocks are very low, generally of hormonal therapy, and IUDs are not available.
Condoms (both male and female) are freely available in large quantities.
403 2019-04-19 21:52:51 In the stocks so we can spit at her
404 2019-04-19 21:52:05 Number of leading stocks today: 16 $SPY $QQQ $FB $GOOG $AMZN $GOOG $AAPL #DailyStkLeaderCount
405 2019-04-19 21:51:19 Rich nigga Twitter, what are some stocks worth investing in?
406 2019-04-19 21:50:39 Love the outfits, and also love Kohl's, apparently they're the only store that stocks dress pants that fit me
407 2019-04-19 21:50:36 Yes, excess capacity.

Of course supply of money is a stocks, and supply of goods is a flows. They cannot be compared directly.
408 2019-04-19 21:50:22 Yes, I agree. Certainly money to be made, but it’s not consistent enough (in my opinion) to really call it a business or an investment. I know GV didn’t say that at all, but others were making that argument & comparing prospecting to stocks. It’s a fun hobby where you can profit.

412 2019-04-19 21:41:41 Two ex-Googlers hope to replace your local fishmonger with a desktop cylinder that only stocks one product per day.
413 2019-04-19 21:41:31 You definitely need to surrender your bump stocks though - something that only an amateur shooter with no trigger reset skill needs.
414 2019-04-19 21:36:40 es a billionaire.  Donald Trump is making promises to everyone to go to his Country Club they can stay at his  hotels they got stocks they got real estate investments.  This is why everybody's willing to go to jail for him. This is why people are willing to say and do anything
415 2019-04-19 21:34:54 TIL If you have a rogue stock ticker in your #iOS today widget that you cannot remove via the Stocks app (!), try getting rid of it via the macOS Today view. The removal will sync via iCloud to your iOS devices, too.
416 2019-04-19 21:34:23 These people are working 40 hours a week at their regular job and then another 25+ hours on their side business (online store, landscaping, etc.)

They invest into stocks, save 10% of everything they earn, and have a partner/roommate to split home expenses.
417 2019-04-19 21:34:16 Real estate, stocks, and starting a business lol then itll generate itself back in about a year or two
418 2019-04-19 21:32:58 Awful this defeat. I was Absolutely gutted after this, still am tbh. Always stocks in my mind this game.
419 2019-04-19 21:31:55 As a convicted securities fraudster, I’m  still amazed that people bet on stocks.
420 2019-04-19 21:31:02 Bill when stocks on Abra?
421 2019-04-19 21:30:20 Bruce berkowitz has gone clinically insane.  Betting the farm on $joe of all stocks.
422 2019-04-19 21:29:43 On the ocean promise. The feds owe NL over 13 billion dollars for the collapse of our stocks - federally managed. Cost us 40,000 jobs, 100,000 people and closed dozens of communities. #cdnpoli #fishery #nlpoli
423 2019-04-19 21:28:22 Of course the "Old Stocks" hate this

425 2019-04-19 21:26:26 At one point they were, but Adidas has taken over as the one who pushes the envelope. Which in turn is why Adidas’s stocks are skyrocketing rn and why their yearly sales have been increasing by 20+% (which are ridiculous numbers).
426 2019-04-19 21:22:01 Just realize that I have not been taking care of my own body after my last breakup.

I've become a very active smoker, very active drinker (which is why my alcohol stocks has always been empty for these last 2 years), and always binge-eating heavily (talking about full-meal).
427 2019-04-19 21:19:34 The Jin Chan (Chinese: 金蟾; pinyin: jīn chán; literally: 'Golden Toad'), also called Chan Chu (Chinese: 蟾蜍;) or "Zhaocai Chan Chu" (Chinese: 招财蟾蜍; pinyin: zhāocái chánchú; literally: 'wealth-beckoning toad'), appeared outside of my house today, and now I have apple stocks.
428 2019-04-19 21:18:59 Stocks end on ±1.25. 

We're even.
429 2019-04-19 21:18:59 other option ... buy lowfloat stocks and burn it all in one day .....
430 2019-04-19 21:18:50 Wow I missed that one. The money was already made after Netflix did their IPO. Right only corporations are the only ones buying their stock back. Once it stops the game is over. You don’t buy stocks when they are up 1286%. You buy when they are 50% off of their true value.
431 2019-04-19 21:18:27 its getting absolutely insane the democrats are making absolute laughing stocks out of themselves no limits to Stupidity and you just cant  fix stupid
432 2019-04-19 21:18:13 Investing, stocks , affiliate marketing , real estate, it’s where is at if you not lazy come fuck with me before it’s too late
433 2019-04-19 21:17:54 I feel like most value theses (not just for HOG) are very sound in terms of analyzing valuation, but lack the component of "what will change the market's mind on this stock?" The same goes for many short theses' of growth stocks that focus too heavily on valuation.
434 2019-04-19 21:14:10 He’s going to out. Why pay a premium for Conner? Not the way I handle my stocks
435 2019-04-19 21:14:01 I know, we as smart people make money off of them as stupid people, I’ve been doing this in stocks since 2009, never underestimate how dumb and short sighted masses are
436 2019-04-19 21:13:52 Stocks plunged as Visteon Corporation unveiled a irritating solar flare today.
437 2019-04-19 21:13:38 apple stocks rise by 69%.
438 2019-04-19 21:12:02 Ha you got stocks ??
439 2019-04-19 21:11:02 Your portfolio of what you own should be based on your age. The younger you are the more stocks you should hold and the older you are the more bonds you should hold #wealth #money #stocks #bonds
440 2019-04-19 21:10:53 Best start looking at .410 shotguns with youth stocks then... 
441 2019-04-19 21:09:05 I mentioned a message forum on individual stocks in the app. There are so many with articles from a month ago.
442 2019-04-19 21:04:08 Like printing more money so stocks don’t go down!
443 2019-04-19 21:03:22 Played like hot garbage in actual bracket fmlllllll

SD'd about 8 stocks total so fuck me
444 2019-04-19 21:03:09 If you're able to make a mountain out of that molehill, you should probably go out & buy some oil stocks Tuesday morning, because you know how to pick a winner!
445 2019-04-19 21:02:41 Once you start wearing slippers, there’s no going back. I’m going to buy a pair for everywhere I go to regularly so I don’t have to go through the horror that is walking across hard floor in just stocks, ever again
446 2019-04-19 21:02:00 Imma start giving my people stocks instead of buying them gifts..
447 2019-04-19 21:01:29 Nope, because currencies are a bigger deal than stocks, and $BNB is basically a stock at this point.
448 2019-04-19 20:59:44 The King already told u thy got stocks in @Uber so every time thou sends a bitch home don’t forget to tip #trick – bij dr Rodriguez
449 2019-04-19 20:59:29 Let’s start investing into stocks, no?
450 2019-04-19 20:59:23 bro i will beat both of u with items on and 2 extra stocks that is guarentee
451 2019-04-19 20:58:25 Stocks are regulated. These, not so much. Not that they need to be. There are plenty of YouTube videos on the subject.
452 2019-04-19 20:57:56 Condemn wilberforce and his legacy to the stocks whilst you're at it! Some of us will die defending the right to be free.
453 2019-04-19 20:57:30 All that money they save on military spending they use to buy stocks
454 2019-04-19 20:55:58 You should have been stopped out.
455 2019-04-19 20:53:40 Can they hike now? After being dovish for 4 months and stocks almost near ath?
456 2019-04-19 20:53:09 This could be one of the most volatile stocks that I’ve traded in 25 years $PYX, it looks like we are at or near a bottom with RSI oversold and first higher low on the daily yesterday. I spoke to IR this week and they feel that they will continue to pay down debt and grow new biz
457 2019-04-19 20:52:47 I will not be investing in Uber at this time or in the near future. Not profitable at this point, big threat with employees (can they keep them contractors or do they need to pay benefits). Driver less cars don't move the needle atm for me. #stockmarket #stocks
458 2019-04-19 20:52:20 You could do one or two stocks to speed up the process.

#ZeroCredibility !!!
461 2019-04-19 20:48:49 I'm trying to wrap my head around this. My son was explaining it to me and my brain is interpreting it like buying stocks. He said no... So I decided to go shopping 
462 2019-04-19 20:48:31 3 stocks one hit! That’s how’s supposed to be
463 2019-04-19 20:48:26 Week 2 of my #LearntThisWeek thread
 
1/ Why do IPOs get underpriced?
 
Case in point: #Jumia stocks soared 75% on its first day of trading. In one sense, a success ($Ms raised). In another, the IPO was disappointing (drastically mispriced/underpriced). Thread continues.
464 2019-04-19 20:46:11 In the middle ages, ne'er-do-wells would be put in the village stocks, be laughed at and humiliated. Sounds like they had the right idea! Rotten tomatoes anyone?
465 2019-04-19 20:45:03 Do I have any friends on here who has invested in stocks?
466 2019-04-19 20:41:45 God do i sell off all my stocks ? @BSEIndia am worried
467 2019-04-19 20:38:53 Kocks bocks stocks rill.
468 2019-04-19 20:38:49 I didn’t say it was dumb. I’ve bought/sold over 100,000 cards on COMC in a few years. Its fun, and I actually earn a profit. It’s dumb comparing that to buying stocks or an ‘investment’ ... especially when we’re talking modern basketball cards. Vintage baseball, that’s different.

473 2019-04-19 20:31:32 think about entering in a fantastic new world full of new giant berries, you binge? or do you find a way to not poison yourself? This is the stocks market
474 2019-04-19 20:30:22 Bullish pot stocks?
475 2019-04-19 20:30:20 My best guess is the US Trilemma is holding (US can have 2 of 3 of rising FFR, rising USD, rising stocks).  If there's a USD shortage as Brent has correctly laid out, then you don't buy US stocks as that would make any USD shortage worse, not better...you'd sell stocks.
476 2019-04-19 20:30:02 Chris just referred to the phases of Sekiro bosses as stocks lmao
477 2019-04-19 20:29:00 So MVP have you benefitted from any tax breaks , do you have any of money invested in any stocks or 401k's ? If so please say thanks to POTUS , Trump doesn't need to testify , based on law there was no collusion , the elections wasn't rigged etc. - I waited for 8 yrs to vote
478 2019-04-19 20:28:31 Or better still free them from glue but then put them in stocks padlock them in and invite passers by to throw rotten fruit or eggs at them
479 2019-04-19 20:28:29 I’m glad me and Mariah both love the shit out of pepper, but we’ve almost gone through a whole pepper shaker in like 4 days... might just fuck around and buy stocks in McCormick at this point
480 2019-04-19 20:26:30 ill 2v1 both of you for the skin but turn on items. and give me 2 extra stocks.
481 2019-04-19 20:25:36 Fyi a quick search shows Robinhood doesn't offer otc/pink sheets. Stocks under $5 only offered if listed on nyse and nasdaq

483 2019-04-19 20:23:31 Like the big corporations whose stocks are owned by Americans. Check the largest holdings at top 50...Vanguard, BlackRock, Fidelity, State Street...meaning millions of average Americans in their retirement accounts.
484 2019-04-19 20:23:03 The Fed will just print a few more trillion and monetize it all (corporate bonds, stocks, real estate...you name it).

The risk-takers will be rewarded and savers punished with higher taxes and dollar devaluation.
485 2019-04-19 20:21:17 I need to start trading and buying stocks but ppl be playing
486 2019-04-19 20:21:14 I'm still holding out for public stocks at the reflecting pool.
487 2019-04-19 20:19:32 Hello, I am  lynch with a quick news update. The Republicans are pushing legislation that could impact the future shares of  F stocks. Thank you for tuning into  Fox.
488 2019-04-19 20:19:01 I've had so much of that in my mentions since I tweeted about the loss of medieval timber stocks that I coined the term "medievaltreesplaining" to describe it.
489 2019-04-19 20:18:10 It’s like cigarettes stocks and V/MA - fear of legislation that never happens
490 2019-04-19 20:15:34 *Hint Hint* if there was ever a time to fuck with AT&T it’s right now...if you watch stocks closely, you now exactly why I’m saying this! 
491 2019-04-19 20:15:22 They should just buy stocks.
492 2019-04-19 20:15:01 Ha Jim, how are your stocks doing?. Thank the President

497 2019-04-19 20:08:14 This is everything. I’m now worrying that next Monday is a Bank Holiday and book club might/ might not be on.
498 2019-04-19 20:08:09 Seen Fernando’s strike??
499 2019-04-19 20:07:53 Going further with this analogy.  Investing in individual cards is like investing in individual stocks, packs is the mutual fund approach.  Look at 2011 Topps Update.  The individual investor in Ackley tanked.  The collector who opened packs is in great shape.
500 2019-04-19 20:07:47 Problem is not in holding stocks like jet. But taking it this long after the disaster speaks volume about risk management at one of the largest AMC.
501 2019-04-19 20:07:46 I took one for the team have 2500 bu of beans got ruined so ending stocks are fictional...
502 2019-04-19 20:05:45 omg they’re checking the stocks for after coachella lmaooooo i’ll screen record!!!
503 2019-04-19 20:05:16 What is remarkable in that chart that even in 2008 foreigners didn't sell US stocks! Foreigners understand deficit problems far better than Americans. US deficit issues in 2019 are much bigger than 2008.
504 2019-04-19 20:04:28 Yes, but the day it happens, sell your stocks!!
505 2019-04-19 20:03:34 Really wish I didn’t lose my other twitter account. Give me a follow & I’ll help u get setup w/ penny stocks & crypto.

Satisfied with my play tho :p
507 2019-04-19 20:00:39 REITs(and owning actual RE)and income vehicles seem like good plan for extended low rate/growth economy

Other option is correctly pick the few stocks or sectors that can still do well like NKE and business software MSFT ORCL
508 2019-04-19 20:00:24 WE MAKE ALL THE OTHER GROUPS WEALTHY . WHILE BUYING ANYTHING THAT DEPRECIATE IN VALUE.NOPE NO STOCKS NO BONDS NOT A HOUSE. JUST JUNK.SOMEBODYS NOW IS GOING FOR BROKE TRYING TO GET THE $2000 DOLLAR FOLDING CELL PHONE NOW. TO EMPRESS THE OTHER POOR PEOPLE. STUPID
509 2019-04-19 19:59:27 Sell your healthcare stocks while you still can!
510 2019-04-19 19:58:46 I still think they should bring back the stocks for people like this….
Or make them wear the big wooden ring around their necks
Mere prison isn't enough
511 2019-04-19 19:56:21 I know lots of people who’ve retired because of stocks. How many people you know retired off their card collection?
512 2019-04-19 19:55:32 Lol it’s actually not it’s just the @RobinhoodApp  just tryna get free stocks when people join
513 2019-04-19 19:52:24 Maybe the @GOPrepublicans want a lot of sick people so that insurance companies can make more profits from treatable illnesses, Mike? I suppose this means that everyone should Invest in pharmaceutical stocks - so that you can pay for your child's illness.
514 2019-04-19 19:51:33 Its always the ones that refuse to open up another tab and do their research. You can buy cryptocurrency and stocks for less than 10$. The value of learning far outstrips your alternative of not knowing. If every black family took 30mins a day together to study cryptocurrency...
515 2019-04-19 19:49:58 But but but - they can’t see, feel, smell, hear, and inhabit stocks. Real must mean real, better returns
516 2019-04-19 19:49:29 Playing Joker on Quickplay doesn't make me want to destroy my adam's apple (as much) even when I get shit like 2 minutes 3 stocks.
517 2019-04-19 19:49:24 He band one accessory (Bump stocks) because he was ill informed by the stay behinds and the RINOs.  Like many other decisions, He's willing to change his stance once better educated.
518 2019-04-19 19:49:18 in zim there is really investment to talk about, the stock exchange has less than 100 active stocks with two bullies delta and econet, no public bonds no options, we got a long way to go.. only then does valuation and cfa earn enough respect
519 2019-04-19 19:49:11 @Google: you’re about to lose millions of users. Tens of millions, and probably a slew of employees who cannot ethically work for a company that supports a massive liar and conspiracy theorist. @bing and @Yahoo, be prepared for sudden growth! Anyone else want to invest in stocks?
520 2019-04-19 19:48:45 Villa are finishing good! They’ll be screwed without Grealish tho!
521 2019-04-19 19:46:57 Haha no chance! You’ll pull it out the bag 
522 2019-04-19 19:44:44 I still find the 'you just got lucky for being in early and everything went up' jokes

We could have invested in plenty of other things instead. Stocks, shares, gold, commodities, etc. We investigated & decided crypto would likely give the best ROI whilst everyone else ignored it
523 2019-04-19 19:43:39 apple stocks rise by 30%.
524 2019-04-19 19:42:07 Haha no problem

530 2019-04-19 19:35:45 Regrettably you have to acknowledge that stocks are cheap for a reason. In the case of SA inc the risks are very real.
531 2019-04-19 19:35:23 You need to practice recovering while getting windboxed, that's shouldn't even be the biggest problem. Greninja being able to trade stocks and kill you with counter when you recover with up-B is faaaaar worse.
532 2019-04-19 19:35:08 Getting pain meds from the pharmacy is *so easy* (at least out here, they can't do narcotics as an electronic rx, it's paper in triplicate, so you must physically get it and drop it and hope the pharmacy even stocks it and wait for them to fill it and....)
533 2019-04-19 19:33:19 This not to mention just more viable options if you took the time to learn.Example KaneBlue started of ass and wanted to quit but kept pushing and boom people actually started using those characters who were originally laughing stocks.Also FF19 was nice for T8 this year to.
534 2019-04-19 19:31:41 I got way more engrossed in this than I expected to! Utterly brilliant!

536 2019-04-19 19:27:31 1. Adequate Sleep (less than 2 hrs of sleep debt for the last 7 days)
2. Pre-market routine (find stocks in play, and filter out high risk plays)
3. Post market tape review (learn one thing new every day)
4. Exercise and meditation (manage or release stress)

Rinse and repeat
537 2019-04-19 19:27:10 It's because their preferred inflation indicator, Cote PCE, is below their 2% target. Not sure what stocks have to do with it.
538 2019-04-19 19:25:11 i hopped into a friendly rotation and won like 7 straight and got 2 three stocks lets go pichu
539 2019-04-19 19:25:03 I would consider a ban on bump stocks if the 1986 Hughes Act was repealed.

541 2019-04-19 19:21:21 The big drops were mostly contained to one section of the market.... biotech/pharmaceutical related stocks and small caps. 

Everything else was totally fine. Transports, financials, industrials, Semis etc
542 2019-04-19 19:21:05 People out there really be acting like they know it all. 

Giving advice on real estate investing when you never owned a property. 

Giving advice on which tech company to buy stocks from when you can’t name the CEO. 

It’s okay not to know something. Stop giving false advice.
543 2019-04-19 19:20:59 I’m not trying to discourage you. Cause things can work. You just gotta know what works for you. I like the freedom and mobility non ownership has. I’d rather do stocks than buy a house. But that’s just me
544 2019-04-19 19:20:33 5/ If we aren’t managing individual stocks/bonds & instead managing beta exposures and planning- flat fee is better way to charge. You can be objective and are compensated for the time you commit to the client.

549 2019-04-21 23:53:20 These thieves are actively manipulating the stock market. They pretend to go after the Big Pharm, the stocks drop, they buy in low then they will do an about face and trash the deal last min causing stocks to rise.  Rinse, repeat for another industry.

588 2019-04-21 23:22:07 We see all these poll numbers, BUT when the laws are past, there is almost ZERO COMPLIANCE. If we are to believe the polls, why did people still hold on to their bump stocks, large capacity magazines, so-called assault weapons......
589 2019-04-21 23:20:26 So i have a temp job until May possibly July. My new ventures of writing, starting up a gaming channel, etc have all failed. Basically i have to put too much focus and effort to grow them. It feels easier and less risky time wise to trade stocks or gamble.

591 2019-04-21 23:14:30 What I enjoy watching the most about those who are shorting stocks is that there is no limit to the amount the money someone can lose.

Why should I have less opportunity for my stocks to grow my wealth than previous generations?
634 2019-04-21 21:55:19 I believe the collapse of government fiat currency will be the culprit for the next global financial crisis. The price increase of your house, stocks, food etc... isn't because the items have gotten more valuable, it's because the currency they're priced in is being de-valued.
635 2019-04-21 21:54:53 @6furlongs I've been focusing on UK and US markets up until now but decided to see what Canadian stocks looked interesting. Any thoughts on HMM.A?
636 2019-04-21 21:54:24 that's not the point. Rather CGC is a gauge of big players risk tolerance.  If they are willing to put a bid in it stocks like DOCU TTD IRBT NOW COUP will get bids as well.
637 2019-04-21 21:54:09 You keep drawing it back to just $10. It’s not that. Doubling brokerage fees on stocks is nonsense that doesn’t help anyone. Not only millionaires buy stocks. Brokerage fees are the main barrier for low income people to get into the stock market and generate wealth for themselves
638 2019-04-21 21:52:29 Well as much as I’m sure like pot, and or pot stocks, they however don’t and will ever lead the markets, esp with $CAT & $BA earnings this week

654 2019-04-21 21:31:31 I love it when Casefile covers an Aussie crime, because you get to hear things like "bloke", "strewth" and "cunt" a lot.

658 2019-04-21 21:28:00 @DRuizG80 and we are STILL in a multi year global stocks bull mkt, irrespective of macro or economics.
659 2019-04-21 21:27:48 I have someone else do my stocks for me so when I lose money it's their fault, but if I start earning money it's because it was my money to start. To earn m9ney and learn nothing is my favourite past time
660 2019-04-21 21:27:18 Decreasing taxes has proven to not increase wages as companies use that money to artificially raise their stocks with massive buybacks.

Increased taxes wouldn't lower wages, wages are tax write-offs.

But you mention governmental corruption, what causes that exactly?
661 2019-04-21 21:26:28 Believe me I'm in the same spot as you. I still go 0-2 at tournaments but I put up a lot more of a fight then I used to. When I started I got floored and three stocked over and over. Now I'm able to take at least 1 or 2 stocks to a game before I go down

666 2019-04-21 21:20:34 If someone claims they know a stock will do “this” then they are essentially claiming that they can read the minds of every single market participant and know what they are thinking and how they will behave based on their feelings.

IMPOSSIBLE!

679 2019-04-21 21:13:18 now you're just being ridiculous, long term, no investment can come anywhere close to the returns of stock, you're telling me investors are going to flee stocks and move into GICs over $10? On $1,000,000 that works out to .001%, not even noticeable.

682 2019-04-21 21:09:55 And the funniest part of that is, most billionaires actual billions is locked up in ownership of big companies and stocks that actually do "rain down" money onto their employees and shareholders.
683 2019-04-21 21:08:24 Very excellent idea.  Remember what our forefathers faced during the Revolution.  Anybody disagreeing with the King's officers faced execution, public ridicule and the stocks.

Tell me again the bull market logic.
686 2019-04-21 21:05:52 Flows are fundamentally easier to manage than stocks. They’re kinda the logistics equivalent of Buddhism. It’s  transients all the way down. Good or bad it gets washed out and cycled around. Stocks in this metaphor are attachments you must transcend.

691 2019-04-21 20:51:38 My grandad used to have stocks and stuff, 
Since life is expensive, investing in something might be a good risk taken ( earn 5 money, use only that 5 to reinvest and nothing money).

That be my tactics.
692 2019-04-21 20:50:52 
693 2019-04-21 20:49:54 Yes, believe it or not there are many companies that only trade stocks. That’s their business. Also the person that got taxed the highest in Sweden last year, was a daytrader. 
694 2019-04-21 20:48:57 You are watching TV because you are looking for hot stock tips and they recommend BUYING $AAPL stock

695 2019-04-21 20:48:37 That’s not really true.. I worked at a factory for 16 an hour and was part of group investments into stocks. Capital gains are taxed, and the cash flows from it are taxed at the corporate level. And when it’s spent. this would just drive business away :/
696 2019-04-21 20:48:24 @russ_charles I'm local to Worcester and wanna buy Dungeons and Doggies for my girlfriend - do you know of anywhere local that stocks it? I wanna support local businesses!
697 2019-04-21 20:44:30 @tschaffer1 my grandmother stories are not nearly as entertaining. She’s currently talking to my uncles about the physical location of her stocks and CDs and stuff. So that we know where to find it when she dies. Death and inheritance comes up frequently at family gatherings.
698 2019-04-21 20:44:05 insane that we do not treat the purchase of stocks exactly the same as we treat any other good or service. Since only the rich trade in stocks typically they could handle a higher rate than average as well. Then we can give autistic kids a fighting chance and have ideal ratios.

So I definitely disagree -.-

731 2019-04-21 20:03:16 I think that's up to the shop. Canna Cabana in Hamilton, whether on purpose or by luck (impression I get from staff, it was the latter) stocks it, and very close to OCS pricing.  No question they're the value champs.  Comparable quality from other LPs will cost you 20-30% more.
732 2019-04-21 20:02:18 All that said - I haven’t found anyone genuinely selling on M4A. It’s much more “M4A headlines are going to make these stocks uninvestable, therefore I should sell.” It’s a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy.

736 2019-04-21 19:59:11 Feels like it. Either the stocks get sufficiently bombed out, or they just stay in headline risk purgatory until at least the democratic primary is resolved.

Although I guess one way they could “work” is a macro scare - cyclical fears overtake regulatory fears.

739 2019-04-21 19:57:20 This is a huge “emperor has no clothes” element of the utility industry. The market bids up utility stocks till they return 4-5%, but the utilities convince Public Utility Commissions that the market requires 10% return. This then biases utilities against non-ratebase options.
740 2019-04-21 19:56:29 And I suppose the reason a story like this isn’t all over the news is because they’re all pro-Clinton? I’ll take my news from a site that’s not in it for the clicks and selling stocks.

762 2019-04-21 19:35:41 Big reason why I don’t feel like stocks are in a bubble yet. No average person is talking about buying.

764 2019-04-21 19:33:15 It also means land is traded for the subsidies it attracts and not for the purpose to which it is or could be put. For some, it is an asset class as much as stocks and shares.

774 2019-04-21 19:22:56 90% of us are workers.  That means you too. 9% work but a lot of their income is from stocks or investments or royalties.  1% don't work for 99.9999% of their income.
775 2019-04-21 19:21:44 Remember, the whole Harper cabinet at first wanted to do nothing when the US economy was about to collapse and take the world with it. Those economic geniuses said it's just a good time to buy stocks cheap. Public outcry woke them up.

777 2019-04-21 19:20:44 I don't mind if even 2 of my positions gap down, the returns would be more than worth the risk, what happens in case of a catastrophic economic event and most of the stocks in the nifty50 are down by 10%, some more than that as there are no freezes on stocks with derivatives.

788 2019-04-21 19:06:01 Here what you “could do” with $30k... and average of 10% a year just sitting on blue chip stocks. Compound interest is a real thing, in 10 years you would have made almost 50k without even working. You gotta make your money work for you even if you ain’t got a lot

793 2019-04-21 19:02:01 Today I built some watchlist and screens so I can better keep track of the offers Mr. Market brings me every day in more real time! I’m not impressed with what he is offering these days. So I’m not swinging at his pitches! That’ll change I bet! Always does! #investments #stocks
794 2019-04-21 19:01:48 you should try to be more creative with character renders like these rather than just the fortnite font and lightning stocks but this is cool
795 2019-04-21 19:00:04 In 1956, ten-year-old Leonard Ross became the youngest prizewinner on a big-time TV quiz program. The youngster won $100,000 on The Big Surprise for knowing about his specialty: stocks!    Hope he invested that dough wisely.
796 2019-04-21 18:59:43 Some stocks have had pump and dump schemes. Every single crypto currency is a pump and dump scheme.
797 2019-04-21 18:58:34 It is time to sell most of your stocks. Not silver- or goldmines.
798 2019-04-21 18:58:16 Ok. Stocks don’t do that... you stay in fiat. Talk to me after

802 2019-04-21 18:53:25 I find ppl care ONLY when they/people they love are harmed—MAGA’s ‘you’re not hurting the RIGHT people’. 

If someone says X is sick, struggling to pay bills, complaining abt SSA or gun rights, I’ll mention Trumpcare,TaxScam,SSA/Medicare cuts,bump stocks, take guns 1st, etc.
803 2019-04-21 18:52:42 Healthcare stocks are taking it on the chin, just like biotech did in 2016 and retail in 2017. I expect them to bounce back end of 2019, if not early 2020.
804 2019-04-21 18:52:13 Looks amazing! Very nice
805 2019-04-21 18:51:47 Stocks in Satan have fallen. Buy Satan now and reap dividends in the future.

812 2019-04-21 18:49:18 Great post. Curious to see whether your backtest portfolios ended up concentrated on certain industries. In Greenblatt's "You can be a stock market genius," he said that 8 stocks in different industries should capture most of the benefits of diversification.
813 2019-04-21 18:46:40 the character shits percent and makes your stocks evaporate lmao. idk how ppl think he's bad.
