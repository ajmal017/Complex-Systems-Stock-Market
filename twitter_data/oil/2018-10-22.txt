11 2018-10-22 23:58:27 What does this have to do with voting for you instead of Beto?

How are you making the oil industry any better than Beto would?

13 2018-10-22 23:57:26 And when you hear Republicans talk about how they have to go after entitlements you never hear him ending oil subsidies corporate welfare in general how come I'm paying tax dollars so Walmart can pay starvation wages and I'm making up with food stamps why can't Walmart pay

15 2018-10-22 23:57:19 I just learned that house heating oil and diesel fuel are the same exact thing, but diesel fuel costs more just because it's a racket.

-taken her homeopathic calming pills

35 2018-10-22 23:57:00 Stop importing Saudi Oil .
36 2018-10-22 23:56:46 The oil sand industry is booming. Anyone who knows how to work on heavy equipment or operate any can have a job upon arrival. Finding a place to stay while working is very difficult though.
37 2018-10-22 23:56:41 Bond was affected by higher oil prices. Original project materials were underestimated. Many roads are going to lose out.
38 2018-10-22 23:56:23 For all of my sistas suffering from intense menstrual pain: 1) Switch to Organic feminine products and/or diva cups- Keep toxic chemical-laden products away from your womb; 2) Increase your magnesium intake- It's absorbed better topically, ex: Magnesium oil or lotion;

41 2018-10-22 23:56:16 I am an AZ MMJ Patient for Crohn’s disease.

I desperately need hashish and hash oil.

I need concentrates because buds simply cannot provide consistent relief for my disease.

When colas or buds are dropped or bumped they lose trichomes. With hash can go 6-8 months Btwn flares
42 2018-10-22 23:56:12 Canada hasn't stopped selling the Saudis military hardware, or buying 300 thousand barrels of their oil every day. We tried selling them some of our no.1 export, smug pretentiousness; but they weren't buying. It's worthless to them unlike here, where it's coveted by nitwits.
43 2018-10-22 23:55:56 That's exactly how you end up with a serious morlock problem.
44 2018-10-22 23:55:54 Next up: Turkey brokers oil sales between Iran and Canada.

46 2018-10-22 23:55:37 Haven’t settled on one method I like best yet, but I’ve used silver sharpie, plain ole’ chalk, and an oil marker. I like chalk and the oil marker best. The sharpies dry out really quickly

55 2018-10-22 23:54:19 Power up that industrial sector. Nothing better for the earth than drilling and refining oil, coal power plants, CO2 just bellowing into the air. Yes of course that was her point. It’s ignorant on more than one level. Maybe b4 electricity was such a hit it would have made sense.
56 2018-10-22 23:54:14 Never a fan of mom & pop oil change spots. The money you supposedly save today can really kill you later if they messed up.
57 2018-10-22 23:54:12 Coconut oil is a blessing and a greasy sticky curse at the same time.
58 2018-10-22 23:54:05 wtf is the matter with you anti-Clinton haters?? carter made mistakes, w made HUGE mistakes, poppy bush was no oil painting: ALL alive, able to take old questions about old decisions- wtf. it's the mystery of our times...

65 2018-10-22 23:53:08 Both sides have enabled Saudi Arabia for their oil because we depended on it for so long. No more. We have more than enough energy and they abuse human rights on so many levels.
66 2018-10-22 23:52:50 Water water everywhere, and not a drop to drink!  This is so, due to the privilege of Big Oil.  Why would we as a society, continue to allow such corrupt ppl to be so obscenely wealthy at the expense of everyone else??  Is it really worth it? Doesn’t seem like it to me...

68 2018-10-22 23:52:18 Forever thankful that I can actually take care of my vehicle, change oil, etc  on my own. 
69 2018-10-22 23:52:13 I've been told to keep my horn comb clean but well oiled. Oil from hair is recommended, but not anything synthetic.
70 2018-10-22 23:52:05 just wasted all my battery life doing these indirects cause i’m at an oil change place and they make me anxious lmao
71 2018-10-22 23:52:01 Freeze them now. Stop importing their oil, the 12% we get from them can easily come from somewhere else. And even better, use our own oil.
72 2018-10-22 23:51:49 Truffle oil mac and cheese, I am intrigued, it sounds yummy.
73 2018-10-22 23:51:23 So if Trudeau stops the shipment of arms to Saudi Arabia for human rights violations, wither stop the import of Saudi Arabian OIL for the same grounds?
74 2018-10-22 23:50:57 Yeah but... oil.
75 2018-10-22 23:50:51 Ted Cruise, Texas is producing 30% more oil than ever. Lowest unemployment in 52 years! 
Trump effect!
76 2018-10-22 23:50:51 hada labo oil cleansing , heimish oil cleansing
77 2018-10-22 23:50:47 Canada is self-sufficient in oil. Why are we trading ANYTHING with these savages?

80 2018-10-22 23:50:22 Because the Irving refinery is incapable of processing oil sands bitumen. It would cost 15 billion USD to renovate all of the Coker units
81 2018-10-22 23:50:15 I suggest guna aztec clay mask and oil cleansing hada labo. avoid mineral oil maybe akan jadi punca lagi clogged pores. buat gritting method
82 2018-10-22 23:50:07 Paying $1.30 for  a litre of diesel  amazingly enough for the 16 years I’ve owned a VW diesel, the price goes up every year the same time most people fill up their oil barrels. Price gouging at its finest  disgusting
83 2018-10-22 23:50:06 I support @YesOn1631. Big Oil doesn’t care about us and we don’t buy their BS about Initiative 1631 in Washington State. It’s time to hold Big Oil accountable. #YesOn1631 #waelex [Via @CivicAction]

85 2018-10-22 23:50:01 Kohler small engines historically are better because they offered an oil filter whereas Briggs didn't.
86 2018-10-22 23:50:00 Countries are doing so (bilateral deals).  Look to KSA investment in IND, this has resulted in special pricing in oil sales. Quid pro quo...
87 2018-10-22 23:49:51 Added to list of "things I wasn't aware would enter my life as a geologist": going on a fruit reconnaissance, and finding a lab that specializes in analyzing only olive oil.
88 2018-10-22 23:49:44 I agree. The way it just soaks up oil  but the one on the left isn’t ripe enough

92 2018-10-22 23:49:00 The pipelines are not going to happen. The States are buying our oil for a 1/4 of the price they are selling theirs for. The states are the ones financially backing the activists, the natives & the federal government to guarantee we don’t get the pipeline.

100 2018-10-22 23:48:30 @tedcruz laying out facts! Beto wants to tax every barrel of oil produced in Texas!
101 2018-10-22 23:48:17 There's no point in building a new refinery in Alberta if we have no way to get the refined products to markets in BC and central Canada.  

We need to build #TMX AND #EnergyEast while upgrading refineries in those markets. That shuts out dictator oil & creates jobs for Canadians
102 2018-10-22 23:48:14 Fully settled into our new home, Jack Johnson playing on Alexa, oil diffuser going, Noel grilling, kids playing, and I’m wrapping up some homework. Life is good. #colife #ASU #MSW
103 2018-10-22 23:48:10 I swear I just think my baby runs on gas and oil 
104 2018-10-22 23:48:04 Um, 4.5 billion which will likely become 10 billion, in addition to NSERC, NRC, NRCan, SDC, the IETC, your new oil sands innovation fund, and the CCEMC's grants to large emitters not enough for you? Personally, I'd put it into a childcare program.
105 2018-10-22 23:48:04 The rise in the DXY has MODERATED the rise in the $ of oil, not increased it. EM currencies, as measured by the DXY, are weakening, thus facing inflation, due to strong USD, via surging GDP and FED rates. It is this dynamic which is causing EM stress. Oil $ is not helping.
106 2018-10-22 23:48:00 Yesterday at the CPC Rally, Scheer pointed out that no protesters are blocking the Saudi oil tankers in the St Lawrence.  We need to fast forward to Oct 19

113 2018-10-22 23:47:07 The jobs available now are jobs that Obama said were gone for good. Good high paying manufacturing jobs and jobs in oil and chemical industries with excellent health benefits
114 2018-10-22 23:47:06 Well, the case Kashoggi is about oil. Marinova was for peace. Peace is irrelevant. If all journalists at once turned their back on violence and just made a concentrated effort on peace initiatives, maybe we could walk a step further. But peace is a bad business for journalism.
115 2018-10-22 23:47:01 They cracked the oil pan on our race car a few years ago. The one time we didn't do it ourselves cause we were in a hurry.
116 2018-10-22 23:46:51 Need a oil change and take my car to emissions
117 2018-10-22 23:46:50 They sell their oil exclusively for dollars.
#petrodollar
118 2018-10-22 23:46:46 we’d need shale oil to be profitable for that
119 2018-10-22 23:46:40 We haven't needed oil for a while. Western foreign policy (Zionist dominated) is about controlling their resources so that regional countries won't stabilize. Is a sick game of keeping others in state of war for multifaceted profit from weapons,drugs, theft of history, &supremacy

121 2018-10-22 23:46:34 How about you drop Saudi Arabia and your regime wars for OIL and get our troops out of the ME??? The US has become a military for oil and $$ corporate bully to long.
122 2018-10-22 23:46:32 If the oil companies spent, 10% of what they are, I-1631 would have failed.  And I certainly would have done the same, because I believe it is fundamentally flawed.    The early October poll...before the No campaign did anything...showed that 1631 would fail.
123 2018-10-22 23:46:29 Bless my mother. I asked to borrow her car this weekend cause mine is a POS and she’s getting the oil checked and everything so it’s good to go for me

126 2018-10-22 23:45:32 Olive olive oil gelato is fantastic, my mom loves it and she doesn’t like anything strange. Trick is a really fruity variety (not so much a peppery one) and a bottle that has a harvest date to ensure it’s fresh. Also having a dewar of liquid nitrogen helps.
127 2018-10-22 23:45:28 Justin - how about block Saudi oil, build a pipeline in Canada and buy Canadian oil???!

132 2018-10-22 23:45:10 read this real quick and thought it said tuna
133 2018-10-22 23:45:00 Also, we can buy from Russia and China at the lowest cost and control the price of oil, which is the artery of nations
134 2018-10-22 23:44:36 Only use a little oil and add salt. You’ll get a similar mouthfeel.
135 2018-10-22 23:44:17 Tarnish him, RTE surely can do. And reduce Saudi prestige, which is already happening, as well as cause some economic harm, although KSA will still have oil to sell. I was asking whether RTE really thought he could force MbS's removal, and if so, whether that was realistic.

138 2018-10-22 23:43:09 Easy Michael. Were selling Saudis weapons and buying their oil, so that means we are supporting the country that just bombed a school bus. We should not judge.

Didn't we do enough with the buying of a pipeline? Now you want us to go beyond paying for the liabilities of big oil as well? Redwater decision.
142 2018-10-22 23:42:55 The “warming” line is actually the UN political goal line. It is after all, the UN IPCC , = Int’l Politburo for Control Change. LOSE your sovereignty to the UN. Remember how “well” the UN Oil for Food Pgm went? The corruption through the highest echelons? Welcome to the nuthouse!
143 2018-10-22 23:42:51 Sometimes I want to nibble a kale salad with olive oil dressing and cracked pepper for dinner. Other times I want to eat 3 bowls of pasta as fast as possible and lay on the sofa feeling my stomach stretch. These are my only 2 moods.
144 2018-10-22 23:42:50 Is there a better two ingredient duo than olive oil and garlic?
145 2018-10-22 23:42:49 Yeah. Oil drums.

147 2018-10-22 23:42:29 One of the many places low interest rates manifested into malinvestment.  Sure makes for a hell of an interesting oil cycle.  

And investors in the space are pissed about lack of returns now...
148 2018-10-22 23:42:18 It smells good! Between the scents, oil, and grounds as an abrasive, it pretty well works with most thingd
149 2018-10-22 23:42:15 Day 1 of fall break:
Oil change 
Flu shot 
Halloween costume selected & materials gathered 
Grocery shopping 
New batch of lunches made 
Laundry is in progress (but one load is done!)

Can’t wait for Day 2!
150 2018-10-22 23:42:12 Ty for sharing!! Maybe we can get a thread going. One of my pet peeve microagressions is being called “sweetie” or “honey”, especially one time when I was getting an oil change and they called guy who came in after me “boss” (like “hey, boss, what can we do for you?”)
151 2018-10-22 23:42:07 This check a free check paid my car note early ..water bill and oil change then the rest putting to the side
152 2018-10-22 23:41:59 Olive oil and noodles is sooooo good. A little basil goes great as well.
153 2018-10-22 23:41:53 Trump has taken deregulation way too far, even during Ike and Clinton the rate was high and the economists booming, but ignoring consumer protections and deregulating the environment, pesticides, as well as the oil industry is calling for greater pollution we don’t need
154 2018-10-22 23:41:47 Hey, if the city or the state can’t get their grubby hands on it, we might actually have a feces, drug, and traffic free form of transportation!

158 2018-10-22 23:41:16 SWEET! We're getting closer to the big oil wrestling match!
159 2018-10-22 23:41:11 You can stop buying oil any time you want.
160 2018-10-22 23:41:06 if you want your skin to clear up try grapeseed oil mixed with vitamin e oil n use it as a moisturizer at night :)))
161 2018-10-22 23:40:49 My area doesn't use oil so I'm good. Thanks for the helpful advice.

163 2018-10-22 23:40:40 Any of these efforts so far have been have hearted. Trudeau bought tmx with our money & paid about 2x its worth. While at the same time putting forth further bills which will delay or stall this project completely. C69 will see to that. NDP were anti oil protestors before govt.
164 2018-10-22 23:40:37 I'm literally so blessed w/ my dad.. he drove all the way to my work in Loveland today to pick up my car take it for an oil change, change my tires, wash it, and gave it back to me w/ a full tank of gas.. he said just because he's proud of how hard I've been working

172 2018-10-22 23:39:44 Ever have that olive oil ice cream from Jaleo? Maybe the best dessert I ever had.
173 2018-10-22 23:39:35 Mind you...acupuncture and CBD oil is a huge improvement.
174 2018-10-22 23:39:21 Newt's burning the midnight oil, trying to get the xenophobes and racists to the voting booth.  this is what the GOP has become -- peddlers of hysteria...  the faux historian has no self-respect..
175 2018-10-22 23:39:16 What about Saudi oil! Or are the Irving’s too important to the Liberals and Conservatives to piss off. Ottawa ethically bankrupt!!
176 2018-10-22 23:39:14 Saw motor oil band in 94/95. Purple tour. Good show! Also saw PJ with Neil Young at Reading 96. Also good.
177 2018-10-22 23:39:05 What about Palm Oil????
178 2018-10-22 23:39:04 What other kind of poop is there?

181 2018-10-22 23:38:47 Andrew was changing my oil and my dad ended up inviting us to our neighbors birthday party
182 2018-10-22 23:38:40 When another man in his likeness dresses in his clothes and walks out calmly and then dumps the clothes, it didn’t seem that that was not in the script...I think  the billions in arms and oil might be blurring your judgement
183 2018-10-22 23:38:39 ยางสิ
184 2018-10-22 23:38:38 For all the brothers with the pubic hair beards, Put some Argan oil on that shit
185 2018-10-22 23:38:36 We certainly don't want to stop foreign oil! After all  Eastern Canada would have a stronger economy than Ontario and Quebec. That would be Totally disaster. We have something like 11 different countries flying the Canadian flag. So stupid!!
186 2018-10-22 23:38:18 Mme, i admire you, i hate your policies, but you remind me the many British women i met growing kids by themselves, so strong and proud i felt a kid in their company, but you're not messing it all up for them, but for some merchant bank sharks, oil&coal dealers & tax frauders
187 2018-10-22 23:38:11 Oooh are you trying to retrain your body clock? I felt crap and didn't sleep last night or Friday night.  But candy crush is my new obsession  I've gone back to cbd oil and hoping helps me relax and sleep x
188 2018-10-22 23:38:06 Hold on Tiger the Redskins have not won anything yet. They’re the worst 4-2 team Don’t get out the anointing oil’s yet
189 2018-10-22 23:38:06 Yas, it is very good. Particularly if oil is infused with ..say garlic ,or sundried tomatoes, or basil leaves and fresh gourmet backed bread loaf. Already salivating while writing this...going to kitchen now....adios
190 2018-10-22 23:37:52 The empty olive oil bottles 
191 2018-10-22 23:37:44 The oil cos always screw it up. They can't be trusted. They've proved it repeatedly.
192 2018-10-22 23:37:40 The Irvings purchase Saudi production and refine it. ‘Canada’ does not purchase oil.
193 2018-10-22 23:37:38 Only oil we have is Wd40 and we are getting by too
194 2018-10-22 23:37:35 Does it last after coconut oil application??
195 2018-10-22 23:37:34 Ended up falling asleep at my gma house & woke up to my pops saying he went and changed my oil 
196 2018-10-22 23:37:24 Foolish man it is you who sleeps with dogs, if not for Oil you would live in a tent! A mere Bedouin with bedbugs in his rug.
197 2018-10-22 23:37:24 The dollars spent on oil and reinvested in the west. The biggest victims of Islamist terror are Muslims-its a fact.
198 2018-10-22 23:37:18 2014. Trump took the $$ away. Wittman wrote a letter.  A LETTER.  One Bay is not equal to helping climate change.  What has he done to protect Poquoson from flooding?  What has he done to protect our beautiful beaches from oil drilling? Zip.  I want new stuff.
199 2018-10-22 23:37:16 Yep, help oil prices head higher long term. The whole "shale revolution" was a mainfestation of low rates and free money. $300B in debt with $250B that needs to roll in next 4 to 5 years. Good luck with that.
200 2018-10-22 23:37:11 My kink is using my hands to coat my kale with fresh garlic, extra virgin olive oil, and Himalayan salt.
201 2018-10-22 23:37:05 crazy how that motor oil band is 500 times the band that pearl jam was
202 2018-10-22 23:37:05 big oil having a fit  and the #fakenews media .. nothing more
203 2018-10-22 23:37:00 Yes it is Canada and it's a better country. We don't drop bombs on children so we can steal their oil. Our news actually reports facts.

207 2018-10-22 23:36:33 I went and grabbed some stuff that Imma need to keep my mouth clean for my piercing and some vitamin oil to help me stretch my ears WHEN THE DAMN STRETCHING KIT DECIDES TO COME IN

211 2018-10-22 23:35:54 add "leverage with oil" and you're good
212 2018-10-22 23:35:49 That's almost like a hot oil treatment. Could be dope too. I've never done it. Good luck lol
213 2018-10-22 23:35:46 Oil, Oil, Oil!!!!
214 2018-10-22 23:35:16 So dont do business with Saudis and dont drill off shore. Where does the oil come from Dianne? Russia!?

216 2018-10-22 23:35:15 The Irvings are the only ones buying Saudi oil. Talk to them.
217 2018-10-22 23:34:51 Your neighbors who left their car windows open a crack are going to love finding someone sprayed their upholstery with stinky fish oil.
218 2018-10-22 23:34:47 Se till att åtala carl bildt också, han har sluppit undan alldeles för lätt, han var djupt inblandad i lundins åtaganden, och lundin oil har i Sudan och Etiopien kränkt och berövat befolkningen deras egendomar och begått folkmord,våldtäkter för att stjäla land som man vill åt
219 2018-10-22 23:34:46 We don’t even need oil anymore we have wind and solar there is no need for oil that’s why it’s only like 50$ a ton
220 2018-10-22 23:34:44 Good thing KSA has those well greased taps, that are a simple twist away from flooding the globe with new oil production...derp.
221 2018-10-22 23:34:40 Russia does force itself on others. That’s a fact. Our country bombs the shit out of others for oil. That’s a fact. I don’t deny.
222 2018-10-22 23:34:38 olive oil on the rocks
223 2018-10-22 23:34:35 Do you have CBD oil there? That might help with sleep

229 2018-10-22 23:33:14 We can live without SLO oil, but not without water. This special place in the world needs to be protected.
230 2018-10-22 23:33:09 The current state of the oil industry is of their own making. Solutions were available decades ago, but both levels of Government were happy to ship as much as they could to American refineries. No level of Govt. controls a world commodity price, so I'm not sure what you expect?
231 2018-10-22 23:33:08 Ok, I 100% Don't care what happened" khashoggi"!! I like cheap crude oil *Gas! 
And if Americans get 600'000 jobs making weapons for Saudi Arabia! 110 Billion dollars! M,B,S! Love!
232 2018-10-22 23:33:05 It's even more interesting who hacked it why and who is to gain, Russia and China have the technology both would benefit from a failed US arms deal and Turkey would benefit in the Saudi power struggle prospective, curve ball the Turkey Russian oil connect financial motivation

237 2018-10-22 23:32:49 @ItalianPolitics @FoxNews @GOP Italian cars are taxed at 5% here. American cars are taxed at 20% in Italy. I will be imposing $40 billion in Italuan tariffs that will impact salami, capicollo, prosciutto, wine, and olive oil!
238 2018-10-22 23:32:46 Sheldon Adelson just donated $50 million to GOP, easy payback for his $700 Million Tax cut;  Valero Svcs (Big Oil) got $1.9 BILLION Tax Cut 1st Quarter alone. Sheer GOP money laundering of public revenue for campaign donations. Trump’s promise? Cheaper healthcare for all!

Alaska does a damn good job balancing resource development.

265 2018-10-22 23:29:44 Not really. Oil generally has a 0.8 modifier to USD.  The strength in USD is moderating oil price (in USD) Inflation in other nations caused by the strength n USD, thus is the USD is the primary catalyst to inflationary pressures/currency weakness in EM's.

271 2018-10-22 23:28:46 I live in venezuela. I know the lies of the regime well. The petro can not be backed by oil because it violates the constitution of 1999. That is why the regime wants to change the constitution.
272 2018-10-22 23:28:40 Ya but if you isolate just oil it'd be around 5. That would be replaced with a robust green infrastructure plan. But your bff Trudeau would never do that. He's too indebted to the fossil fuel industry like the scumbag Cons.

281 2018-10-22 23:27:37 they don't give ashit ...just keep buying  their oil they don't care ...
282 2018-10-22 23:27:29 キャノーラ油のキャノーラがCANadian Oil Low in Acidの略称だと初めて知った。
てかこの名称だと、キャノーラの後に油って付けるのは変だな。

289 2018-10-22 23:26:48 Any scientist Fox news digs up is always dripping oil with pockets full of cash for lies.

He was on ipcc 4th committee.

You know, they people predicting a 7° rise in global temps in the next 80 years.

He says not to worry new technologies are coming that will eliminate oil use
290 2018-10-22 23:26:27 I’ll hit it from the back while I eat chicken wings let that grease fall onto your back and rub it in like baby oil
291 2018-10-22 23:26:25 chocolate almonds cuz the ends don't have those lil Xs on the ends. also they're super shiny, and for olives to have shine like that they'd need to be oily, but there's no sign of oil on the bowl. 
292 2018-10-22 23:26:06 Pretty disingenuous. The Harper government, of which you were a part, sucked from the teat of Saudi oil for a decade. You must not think highly of the citizenry.
293 2018-10-22 23:25:55 I think this is the first oil change since my CAI was installed too actually. 
294 2018-10-22 23:25:51 It's an oil system vent on RR Trent engines, mainly air but a little oil smoke mixed in. I believe you only tend to see the smoke with the engine at low power (due seal design). As stated, it's completely normal.
295 2018-10-22 23:25:44 It won’t affect the world price of oil one way or the other if SA stops selling to Canada.  No big deal.
296 2018-10-22 23:25:32 Only to feed them with our money, buying their oil and, as you said, getting ZERO!
297 2018-10-22 23:25:28 Dude, driving with new oil feels amazing. Why tf did I put this off LOL

301 2018-10-22 23:25:19 I lived in Canada for a couple of years. I would go the Muskoka lakes for weekends and come back looking like I had measles. Mozzies don't Avon Skin So Soft bath oil (original fragrance) and I can smell why.
302 2018-10-22 23:25:17 Start smoking pot! That numbs the pain then follow on with a course of canabis oil. To aid healing. Reduce stress and above all stop taking pharmaceuticals. Drug companies like Lilly, create medicines purposely with side effects. Only exception is Lilly has the best Insulin.
303 2018-10-22 23:25:12 @SirSicCrusader, you are a maniac. I couldn’t stop laughing and crying while watching your “Urine is magic” video (morning wood vomit, that one got me hysterical for 5 minutes).

I’m gonna go guzzle a piss/bleach/coconut oil cocktail and watch another vid 
304 2018-10-22 23:24:31 Cod liver oil is high in Vitamin A, which can reduce oil production.
305 2018-10-22 23:24:30 No deal has given a glimpse of how it’s an illusion. Embargoed, we would run out of oil and many foods in days, and that won’t change post Brexit… we will remain dependent on others for support…

310 2018-10-22 23:23:37 Parnell was deemed to be anathema to their priorities moreso than the other candidates.

Oil lobbief for tax changes several times. It's been well documented in APOC and well reported on. 

While both are political discussion items, neither are factually controversial.

312 2018-10-22 23:23:11 If we all get the green light to build the East and West pipelines and use OUR OWN OIL, instead of buying the Arabian one, then, Yes, we can cancel that contract.. otherwise, why there are Canadians so stupid to buy from them and refusing to sell to them?? What is wrong with you
313 2018-10-22 23:23:09 Whewwww I put that peppermint oil in my scalp and was scratching like I had fleas. My scalps too sensitive for it 
314 2018-10-22 23:23:04 Yes. But there are levels to this. Do you at least understand that Zinke is corrupt and is selling off land cheap to oil and mineral interests from his hometown while being entrusted with the country’s interior?

319 2018-10-22 23:22:32 The valuation of the USD is the driver of current EM stress, not oil price, IMO.
320 2018-10-22 23:22:23 Hey Chris, I saw you use oil. Do you use CBD? I need to order some. My next order might have THC
321 2018-10-22 23:22:12 Not a vanilla fan, but here's one I always love: vanilla ice cream topped with candied ginger, dates, and pumpkin seed or butternut squash seed oil. Served with some sort of crispy ginger cookie on the sude.
322 2018-10-22 23:22:09 The FA on $AOW is great. Especially in this oil environment. I can see why Wilsons are loading up. There seems to be a little bit of selling this morning but may just be stuck traders. Happy to hold this one for a while as they expect to earn a lot of money going forward.

324 2018-10-22 23:21:55 naintriga ako sa Kora face oil, thanks for recommending
325 2018-10-22 23:21:53 The have natural gas,oil, technologies and sweet,sweet radishes.Maybe they want to buy from us? Set up new industires. If you and Chief Jackass-face (@SenWarren)want to pick up a rifle and punish Putin,be my guest friend.  Deterrence,the nuclear kind,got us through the Cold War.
326 2018-10-22 23:21:36 The subsidies are to help level the playing field for new technology.  A fair comparison would include all externalities including oil subsidities, costs of spills, health effects etc.
327 2018-10-22 23:21:32 What if oil is just last humanity’s decomposed DVDs
328 2018-10-22 23:21:31 Can’t believe I was born into a generation that can’t even change its own oil. 
329 2018-10-22 23:21:28 You do what u can do if you don’t think Cada should export even more oil( I don’t think it makes sense when the demand is there). But if Scheer thinks enviros actually prefer Saudi oil over Cndn, he’s even more out to lunch then I imagined.
330 2018-10-22 23:21:22 should i use a cleansing oil this winter and how do i use it
331 2018-10-22 23:21:20 big papi!!! I’m a huge fan!!! What do you think should we pull our support for the Saudi led offensive in Yemen?? Given their human rights record I’m not sure we want to be so aligned w them, my fear Big Papi is that our reliance on oil may force us to overlook such atrocity
332 2018-10-22 23:21:17 Yeah, problem also is, that they are sitting on the best quality oil, the stuff that is cheapest and nicest to refine. 

Everywhere else has heavy, sour crude. 

Lots more work to refine into useful things.
333 2018-10-22 23:21:11 Has to be a grunge or industrial rock band, get the tie in to oil. ;)
334 2018-10-22 23:21:03 You mean like, "if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor" or "if you like your plan you can keep your plan", or Benghazi was due to a video, or you can't interfere in US elections, or the Keystone pipeline is for oil that bypasses the US.. yep that's some reality & facts

339 2018-10-22 23:20:14 Trump revised the rule after Congress failed to repeal it last year. E P A  proposed easing its own protections on methane emissions. That move is aimed more at new oil and gas sites and would cut required inspections for leaks from every six months to once a year.
340 2018-10-22 23:20:00 My favorite DSP shit is when he expects the chat to think just like him, and when they don't have the mindset of a snake oil salesman he gets so genuinely mad
341 2018-10-22 23:19:58 Ah the good old days of random requests, along with "oil left hand"... though the look on your face for "put boobs in eyes" was one of "what the actual fuck" then you were just like eh, fuck it let's do it

His time to defect is as soon as Boris Johnson is selected as interim leader, Soubry would join her good snake oil friend & join the Liberals Democrats
I suspect Greens also.

350 2018-10-22 23:18:55 I would think the food being imported would be a good counter balance to the oil. 
But then I remembered that food is fast easier to get ahold of than oil, so the Saudis could import it from someone else.

354 2018-10-22 23:18:33 RU is still far from maxed out in terms of sanctions. As for oil price as "shale band", again the price would need to drop below what would be acceptable to OPEC+, so a moot point. There are greater systemic barriers to + shale prod, than financial incentive, at any $.

358 2018-10-22 23:18:09 I totally get that, nothing feels safe with our environmental laws especially with Trump going after California’s Clean Air Act exemption, but preventing anyone from getting leases for oil and gas construction should be a pretty strong preventative measure
359 2018-10-22 23:17:59 @HardballChris Lyin Ted meet mega Lyin Donny. Together they can’t come up with one truthful statement. I can see the horse drawn wagon with the two snake oil salesmen telling everyone they won’t take away pre-existing conditions. Just buy our bottle of snake oil.

361 2018-10-22 23:17:49 That's a relief *smiles*.. The oil is meant to be romantic but it's too heavy for some and can be used to cover up the bad aromas from the sewers but I am pleased you like it
362 2018-10-22 23:17:47 Ban Saudi oil
363 2018-10-22 23:17:42 B nice to see Canada faze out oil and use alt energies. We already produce enough oil to not have to import. Just stop selling it to USA!
364 2018-10-22 23:17:36 Why should we depend on other countries to supply us oil? Shouldn't we be more independent and use our own natural resources instead of buying from the Russians and middle east countries you are always hating on?

406 2018-10-22 23:12:33 Thanks for letting me know. When I did my investigations of the money streams the gambling returns were more than the oil and gas/coal returns. It will be interesting to see what change the Kenney will miraculously do in government.
407 2018-10-22 23:12:32 I love my daddy so much . I called him just to express that i had to spend my last on a oil change and he instantly said he gone send me some money bc he don’t want me broke! I love that mannnn i was sad ash at first
408 2018-10-22 23:12:30 They know that as soon as the oil dries up, they will go back to the way they were. 

No sign of that happening any time soon, but we have no idea what their remaining proven reserves are. 

They have never allowed an independent audit.

415 2018-10-22 23:10:47 you should try De Cecco brand spaghetti, it's made by bronze dies that make the surface rougher so the sauce grips to the spaghetti, always salt the water and never use oil when boiling, put some italian sausage links in your sauce and simmer for about 3 hours, yummm
416 2018-10-22 23:10:37 However still interesting that oil sands revenue is similar to the money we fork out for gambling; at one time gambling revenues were more. Last year OAG was 1226 million and gambling 881 million. So we could all gamble more.
417 2018-10-22 23:10:34 It's 2008 and the shork absorber was the external reserves which we are currently building from just above 20 something billion to 44billion. The difference is there was oil boom but we are building ours despite the opposite

Draw in 9 days for free bottle if you order this month

421 2018-10-22 23:10:07 everytime i check my oil or tire pressure i want to RAGE
422 2018-10-22 23:10:05 Wait, scientists, using science, have told us we're pretty much going to resorting to cannibalism to feed ourselves because of carbon pollution and she wants to ship more oil? Rachel, your job isn't worth your kids lives. @RachelNotley
423 2018-10-22 23:10:04 Gotta own the libs by buying snake oil
424 2018-10-22 23:10:00 to continue from this afternoon i am glad that you guys got the education and growth that you needed to realize that calling darkskin women oil spills and roaches was wrong. i am proud of you!!!!!!
425 2018-10-22 23:10:00 Day ... 3 or 4 of being vegetarian:

Dinner is half a glass of milk and a perfectly-ripened avocado (this never happens!) cut up and sprinkled w/salt & pepper & the tiniest bit of lemon juice and olive oil. Simple, took 3 minutes. Yum. 

I can do this! 
426 2018-10-22 23:09:48 cats cradle is vegetable oil when she bought
427 2018-10-22 23:09:39 I just remembered the oil spill was in 1969, oh how I wish for an edit button
428 2018-10-22 23:09:36 Just tell me where you keep your oil 
429 2018-10-22 23:09:32 yes i did just put oil meant to heal my illness on the bottom of my feet . welcome to college
430 2018-10-22 23:09:13 I've started putting lavender oil on my pillows at night to help with sleep. I must say it's very refreshing.
431 2018-10-22 23:09:03 Sana oil
432 2018-10-22 23:08:57 @ChukaUmunna is a snake oil opportunist and has too big an opinion of himself to defect to a small party. He'll say and do anything, even if he contradicts himself just to be relevant... hang on a minute. You're right he's perfect for the turncoat #LibDems
433 2018-10-22 23:08:55 Olive oil, sit, wash & then use a moisturizer that’s fragrance/paraben free
434 2018-10-22 23:08:55 Long story; short version. I drove a Mazda 626. Got JL oil change. Week later, engine vibrating. Took it back. Dude was like take it around the corner to some shop. Thought abt it, said nah. Went to dealership. Almost no oil & no engine. JL never tightened cap. Me: . The end.
435 2018-10-22 23:08:50 How has CBD oil not been apart of my life until now???!
436 2018-10-22 23:08:45 Pretty disgusting that all those atrocities went by without a hesitation over buying oil and selling weapons. Murdering one journalist is a long way down the list of Saudi crimes.
437 2018-10-22 23:08:26 Thanks for explaining. Given that the the U of A presented in 2007 to the government of the day how a PST could have been revenue neutral to Albertans who made less 60K$ a year at one point and the government would never spend past their means in oil downturns
438 2018-10-22 23:08:22 Cool. Now soak that note in oil, light it on fire, and slip it into his gas tank for science
439 2018-10-22 23:08:22 Largest tax cuts in US history leading to biggest federal deficit in US history combined with drastic funding cut for healthcare. Yes, big business may prefer that environment. Trump-style economy is not what Canadians want. Get a job with a snake oil company, in sales 
440 2018-10-22 23:08:12 Yeah, you're not a liar at all "The company first proposed the project in 2013, when oil prices neared $100 a barrel. But the project's future had come in doubt since then as the economics changed". WHY WAS THE PROJECT NOT APPROVED WHEN YOU WERE IN CHARGE?
441 2018-10-22 23:08:00 Yooooooooooo’ My coworker sales makeup right, tell me why she showed my co-manager some oil absorbent sheets & he said he’ll take those to roll joints 
442 2018-10-22 23:07:53 You should really check out the food history and recipes of New Mexico, Michael. Totally different than everything around it. My grandmother taught me a lot about it, like frying corn tortillas for just a few moments in oil.
443 2018-10-22 23:07:38 That won't last though. 
What are they going to export once the oil is gone? 
Sand and how to abuse women tutorials?
444 2018-10-22 23:07:30 my mom gave me these weird oil things and i’m loling but also i WILL put oil on the bottom of my foot rather than making a doctor’s appointment
445 2018-10-22 23:07:06 Power the future, eh? Renewables are the future, the only sustainable future. Oil and gas will run out. Oh, wait - you’ll be dead so you won’t care.
446 2018-10-22 23:06:59 Temple was important to the Story of Jacob, as Jacob built an altar (a stone with oil) in his land called Bethel, which is translated to "House of God". #cbg2 #theactualbig5 #temple
447 2018-10-22 23:06:57 Just had a drip eh hamemade oil/tincture. After 5nins the time was 11:93..

449 2018-10-22 23:06:16 @Oil_Drop It's encouraging that Blue Jays brain trust (?) has spoken with Stubby Clapp about mgr.'s job. I spent some time with him during his time here. Credentials are good. Intensity is terrific. And he's Canadian. A good teacher, I'll bet.
450 2018-10-22 23:06:09 Yawaaaa hapdusa labsikan ug oil oy
451 2018-10-22 23:06:09 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
452 2018-10-22 23:06:04 The real solution to making Saudi listen is to stop buying their oil.
453 2018-10-22 23:05:44 Seems partially religious (and you've taught me there's plenty of money in religious scaremongering), but also feeds into a larger anti-science movement where the money is in climate change denial and snake oil medicine.
454 2018-10-22 23:05:22 Private enterprise, free markets, and individualism has created the most prosperous civilization ever known to mankind. Socialism on its own has failed in every country. Only Denmark, has had success because of the oil the government sells and shares the wealth with its citizens.
455 2018-10-22 23:05:15 Then may I recommend rosemary oil? A lot of at home flea repellant has rosemary as an ingredient so it is safe for cats to be in contact with. I'd say to play safe though have one room without the air being diffused just as an escape if the smell overwhelms your cat
456 2018-10-22 23:05:00 I see Sir *blushes*.. I hope they will not arrest me *giggles*.. You're comments about me are very kind.. The smell is oil of Rose
457 2018-10-22 23:04:57 you. me. some oil

460 2018-10-22 23:04:28 Only 13 percent canada is bulk of us oil
461 2018-10-22 23:04:28 I support @YesOn1631. Big Oil doesn’t care about us and we don’t buy their BS about Initiative 1631 in Washington State. It’s time to hold Big Oil accountable. #YesOn1631 #waelex [Via @CivicAction]
462 2018-10-22 23:04:07 Oh don't think for a moment I am excusing or justifying it. 

It's just the world as it is. 

I am just under no illusion that the west as any influence or control over Saudi Arabia. 

Not while they are sitting on that massive puddle of light, sweet crude oil
463 2018-10-22 23:03:48 What’s a good castor oil brand for hair?
464 2018-10-22 23:03:28 Me too. In Seattle we had a tax law pushed for defeat by big oil, a gun reform law sued by the NRA and my 2 female reps, @SenatorCantwell and @RepJayapal
465 2018-10-22 23:03:15 Uh oh 
He’s got his sleeves rolled up like a county fair
Snake oil salesman.
466 2018-10-22 23:03:03 I need my oil changed but I’m tooo impatient to wait & have no appointment

469 2018-10-22 23:02:06 Climate change is a line of crap. If the government cared about climate change if there was any climate change they would have came out with the ev1 if anybody knows what the ev1 is the electric car that came out 10 years ago. Democrats in oil companies crushed it.

471 2018-10-22 23:02:01 Dinner tonight was rigatoni tossed with leftover olive oil poached chicken. I mixed in grated Romano cheese and some lemon juice. It was super yummy.
472 2018-10-22 23:01:58 I  have stage4 after mentioning severe pain to different gp'd over the yrs all to no avail, I was told I had low pain threshold , it's normal, take  evening primrose oil. Had I been taken seriously it could've been detected much sooner & I would probably be able to work as an OT
473 2018-10-22 23:01:44 I’m sick and this CBD oil has me loopy and laughing at stupid things is it placebo
474 2018-10-22 23:01:37 40 years ago teachers were telling us the Amazon would be stripped of trees, oil would be gone by 2000, Europe would be ruined by acid rain and all European rivers would be dead. Skepticisism is not denial.
475 2018-10-22 23:01:36 I just received a yearbook I did not ask for in the mail, and it smells like someone doused the shot in tea tree oil. It’s permeating the whole room and feels like I can’t breathe 
476 2018-10-22 23:01:36 Joker.. It's Ocean and Oil
477 2018-10-22 23:01:32 I Hope you drive alot so u come back to get another oil change soon 
478 2018-10-22 23:01:20 I just gave you a link (you could’ve read) with a half dozen market analysis on it that flies right in the face of your nonsense.

There isn’t a market analysis out there done by ANYONE reputable that sees Oil/Gas retreating or even losing market share until well after 2050.
479 2018-10-22 23:01:15 As Drumpf is still under Russian money laundering bribes to kill our democracy as the some with the Kings of S. A. Oil bribes!! What happens to our electric cars??

482 2018-10-22 23:00:11 Its simple: he’s dangling this phantom tax cut as a carrot to keep Rs in power. The message being they can only do this (which he has no plans to actually do) if Rs keep control. He’s a huckster promising snake oil remedies.
483 2018-10-22 22:59:49 He’s a snake oil salesman.  He’ll bankrupt us like he’s done all his life with Trump companies.
484 2018-10-22 22:59:42 Congrats! Keep up the great work!
485 2018-10-22 22:59:19 I didn't read Wikipedia, I think you need to read Oil, Politics and Violence: Nigeria's Military Coup Culture by Max Siollun
486 2018-10-22 22:59:10 I assume you’re using or trying cannabis or oil ???
487 2018-10-22 22:59:05 Which is important?
Human life or oil price !!!!!!!
488 2018-10-22 22:59:03 #Texas can have the best-liked or the most-loathed Senator in the country.
That's a no-brainer in most states.
Texans pride themselves on the LONE Star thing (which OIL allows), but there's a lot to be said for popularity when Senator & Constituents want particular bills to pass.
489 2018-10-22 22:59:00 Hoes be flying, knowing they need an oil change! 
490 2018-10-22 22:58:58  multigenerational oligarchs, oil families Rockefellers & Rothsies
491 2018-10-22 22:58:42 My dad just bought oil then drove 40 minutes to where I was to put the oil in my car (cause I’m a dumb ass and almost ran out) and then he filled my gas tank. And he had a good attitude the whole time. I don’t deserve him
492 2018-10-22 22:58:40 If you have anxiety and depression, on a level that keeps you stuck, and feeling out of your body, brain fogged, or like you’re hopeless, TRY CBD OIL OR EDIBLES. I haven’t felt this normal in years. I’m completely grateful right now, and happy without compromising my sobriety. 
493 2018-10-22 22:58:17 Good writing and TLJ go together like oil and water. The many logic gaps are glaring
494 2018-10-22 22:58:06 Surprise! Surprise! #Saudi #Arabia pretends to be a #civilised #country when 99% of the world knows it isn't! !  #Money! #Oil #Morality? Who cares? Not the #USA, not the #UK and not #France, continues to #Kill the innocent #children of #Arabia!
495 2018-10-22 22:57:50 Great comments regarding Canada becoming energy independent and stopping the imports of oil from countries with poor human rights records.
496 2018-10-22 22:57:45 You need to listen to scientists, and economists, and stop listening to Big Oil executives even though they butter your bread. The survival of the people you represent depends upon us acting now against pollution.
497 2018-10-22 22:57:40 Looking forward to whether you’ll still be selling the snake oil in two weeks when Trump throws you under the bus for mid term results.
498 2018-10-22 22:57:30 i really want a oil diffuser

Once again, selling snake oil without checking with the adults on how things are done.
501 2018-10-22 22:57:06 BACK IN MY DAY, ALL THESE PUBLIC YIFFSUITERS WOULD BE BOILED IN OIL AND HAVE THEIR FAT SOLD FOR SOAP #furrycornette
502 2018-10-22 22:56:57 Anyone need a commission of an oil painting of anything u want to see  I’m doing a couple rn dm me
503 2018-10-22 22:56:38 I don’t know what’s making me nauseous for over a week now, but it’s got me ready to snort this peppermint oil  anyone’s hormones done this to them when they aren’t pregnant? I really don’t think I’m sick at this point but all tests are negative. Ugh. Maybe an imbalance?
504 2018-10-22 22:56:26 Stopping weapons sales would leave SA defenseless against Iran, as Russian is allied with Iran, China gets 80% of it's oil from Iran.  We have numerous avenues of sanctions to use.
505 2018-10-22 22:56:25 They can show them a thing or two about growing potatoes. 
You know why the Irish have potatoes & the Arabs have oil don't you?
The Irish had the first pick!!!!!
506 2018-10-22 22:56:25 Wet ingredients are things like 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract, 1/3 cup whatever kind of milk you want, 1/3 vegetable oil or liquid coconut oil, 15 ounces pumpkin purée.
507 2018-10-22 22:56:23 Required (re)reading: “Bodily Natures” by @StacyAlaimo. Reminding us that, no matter what we [read: oil executives, heads of state, conservative Americans] tell ourselves, our biological selves are caught up in environmental processes we can barely begin to fathom.
508 2018-10-22 22:56:20 If you have anxiety, like the that keeps you from functioning and growing. Or depression that keeps you feeling hopeless, TRY CBD OIL OR EDIBLES. My life has literally been changed without compromising my sobriety. Today was a GOOD DAY YAL.
509 2018-10-22 22:56:19 Top ways to shrink your carbon footprint:
Assassinate an oil tycoon
Assassinate a legislator who opposes regulation on emission-heavy industries
Maybe try biking
Assassinate a coal executive
510 2018-10-22 22:56:12 I think the US danger of slipping into a Godless Houston oil industry- anything to make a buck, ignore climate change, and keep me in my mansion materialism - is a more real soul sucking danger. The pastor needs to smell the coffee.
511 2018-10-22 22:55:54 my vape oil is fucking Minions-themed and I kinda want to die but I'm still gonna smoke it

(I can't believe I threw away the packaging without documenting this, I'm so sorry internet)
512 2018-10-22 22:55:52 Where do think the lac Megantic oil come from, the oil produced in western Canada varies from light (<1Mbbl/day in Canada) to heavy crude(>1.5 Mbbl/day)
513 2018-10-22 22:55:49 Happy Monday friends let’s acquire this

- 1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast
- 2-1/4 cups warm water (110° to 115°)
- 3 tablespoons sugar
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 2 tablespoons canola oil
- 6-1/4 to 6-3/4 cups all-purpose flour
514 2018-10-22 22:55:43 Friendly reminder to my beautiful women on twitter right now to go get your oil that you never check on changed before your car start smoking out of nowhere.
515 2018-10-22 22:55:40 I tried to save you on them bears... They put the wrong oil in a new engine it's gunna work but not well.
516 2018-10-22 22:55:38 Just found out we have about 10,000 oil spills each year
517 2018-10-22 22:55:18 Oya jump inside hot akara oil la
518 2018-10-22 22:55:02 One of my all time favorite olive oils is found at a local store downtown. It is a great place to get oils, spices, and infused vinegars (strawberry balsamic is delicious paired with this Italian blend olive oil) #buylocal #designedtobehealthy #JESUSlikedoliveoil
519 2018-10-22 22:54:53 It seems like continually pointing to how much we subsidize oil and gas has to be part of that conversation. The market is artificially low for the most damaging types of energy. Cutting the corporate welfare should be a campaign issue.
520 2018-10-22 22:54:51 "Oh-

I have sunflower oil, that'll work." He hummed as he moved into his kitchen to retrieve the 1L bottle.
521 2018-10-22 22:54:43 I just want to oil Eric Reid's awkward locs.
522 2018-10-22 22:54:28 Well , let’s keep in mind just last week-Saudi Officials stressed the importance of KSA to global economy (which is true ) , as well as the Turki Aldakhil article in Al Arabiya , article where oil threat was explicitly raised.
523 2018-10-22 22:54:03 Obama & Facts = Oil & Water
524 2018-10-22 22:53:52 im going to be big oil for halloween
525 2018-10-22 22:53:49 おはようございます
ありラジラでっす
526 2018-10-22 22:53:48 Juan Valdez........is he that guy who spilled all that oil?
527 2018-10-22 22:53:46 And continue to buy oil from them while we leave the oil under Alberta in the ground.
528 2018-10-22 22:53:36 Aye I've been watching, I've seen the abuse ye've taken and how ye've handled yerselves with educated, sometimes eloquent and experienced responses. I wouldn't know how to respond to the quackery and snake oil followers.
529 2018-10-22 22:53:18 Get creative. Put a dick sleeve on it. A sock hell and oil. Anything to bring something to the table
530 2018-10-22 22:53:14 How about start selling them to companies that produce a spread that doesn't contain cheap PALM OIL and therefore contributes to ecological disaster?
531 2018-10-22 22:53:12 Ahora falta decirle "no more oil for EEUU" para que el jetón de la casa blanca se meta la lengua en el bolsillo #gringogohome
532 2018-10-22 22:53:11 Purchasing Duke's light with olive oil may be my biggest mistake of 2018
533 2018-10-22 22:52:33 Wait until they restrict the flow of oil on which we’re dependent. This will affect each and every one of us, not just those involved in arms manufacture.
534 2018-10-22 22:52:26 Better than lying trump and oil slick Cruz !!! A conman pathological liar unethical businessman admitted sexual assaulter multiple philanderer cadet bone spurs and tax evader by his entire family that’s trump!!!
535 2018-10-22 22:52:22 It took time to come back and it's not perfect but I lost the weight at a sensible pace. I look after myself and used rose hip seed oil coming up to the competition and take vitamin c supplementation and hydrate well. With good whole foods my skin is completely clear too.
536 2018-10-22 22:52:15 Wala ako pambili oil diffuser. Tas parang mas ano pa din yung candles. Haha
537 2018-10-22 22:51:57 Infuse your olive oil with garlic and/or chili 

It will turn a mediocre olive oil into something more edible ..

Also look for the  
Azeite Gallo on your supermarket shelf...
538 2018-10-22 22:51:51 As an example, I just had a low follower con-troll announce that Quebec buys their oil from SA so they don't have to buy it from AB - seriously, it actually said that, in public, on purpose...sigh...
539 2018-10-22 22:51:48 even here in byo ok $5 grocery plus cooking oil
540 2018-10-22 22:51:46 Excited to be oil free.
541 2018-10-22 22:51:41 "Depends on what kind of oil you're looking for."

The kelpie hummed out.
542 2018-10-22 22:51:38 Trudeau will never terminate a contract for weapons Canada’s building for Saudi Sheiks. 
If he did Saudi’s would cut off Oil Tankers bringing millions of barrels of oil to Ont & Que
So really the lack of Pipeline from Alberta to Ont & Que makes Canadians whore’s to Saudi Sheiks
543 2018-10-22 22:51:32 @realDonaldTrump is a treasonous, lying snake selling snake oil to marks.
544 2018-10-22 22:51:30 “Your air filter is dirty” yes it is have you seen the air in LA? It gets dirty 2 days after I change it. Put mine back in my car and don’t touch it again. I’m here for the 20 minute oil change and that’s it.
545 2018-10-22 22:51:24 My whole head smell like Blac Castor Oil

547 2018-10-22 22:51:13 Lyin Ted meet mega Lyin Donny. Together they can’t come up with one truthful statement. I can see the horse drawn wagon with the two snake oil salesmen telling everyone they won’t take away pre-existing conditions. Just buy our bottle of snake oil.
548 2018-10-22 22:50:47 It appears she is going for localized attack. spiked heels at Goodwill are now wiped out. Ninja female assassins will be tossing them like daggers.  I will safely protect myself by laying under my car & changing its oil. I pity the fool doing something unmanly.
549 2018-10-22 22:50:38 That's hilarious.  Since when did the left care one wit about national debt???
As far as crime goes, it's the democrat led inner cities that have the bulk of the problem.  Check your oil Ron.  It's a bit low.

I’m growing up guys!
562 2018-10-22 22:49:22 My mom literally asked me how does my weed get me high when it’s oil and how does it burn if it’s a pen. Ohhh lord she is so old school. The new generation of smoking marijuana has changed mother.

566 2018-10-22 22:49:14 People have distorted perceptions of risk. To ask for risk free energy is to ask for oil that doesn’t burn, electricity that doesn’t electrocute, and dams that never burst.

568 2018-10-22 22:49:04 They're reviewing the situation. Don't be surprised if they cancel the deal. 

WE (ie Canadians) aren't giving Saudi any direct money for oil. Private oil companies buy their oil, refine it, and sell it back to us. The government does not buy oil.
569 2018-10-22 22:48:55 Why I didn’t know when you buy a new car you get free shit?! I’ve been paying for oil changes. They was free.

577 2018-10-22 22:47:28 A tragedy no doubt. But the bigger tragedy is how the majority of the worlds oil wealth ended up in the hands of ultra authoritarian ultra religious weirdos.

580 2018-10-22 22:46:49 Wash them, put them in a pot and simmer them a little until you can peel them better. Then you can do many things with them. Or peel them raw cut them in chunky slices and put them in the oven with a bit of Olive Oil on top,and we will all come to tea
581 2018-10-22 22:46:40 I think the point is to use our own oil for actual fuel and use food for food.   At least I hope so.

586 2018-10-22 22:46:11 We're too dependent on Saudi Arabia. If we were to sanction them, we would be harming ourselves. Oil prices would sky-rocket. If we stopped the Military weapons order, Russia or China would just take the order. I like Rand but he never addresses the points I just raised.
587 2018-10-22 22:46:05 Oil change is so easy it should be free anyway. Not to take away from this nice deed ' Cos especially dealerships are notorious but still warm the engine, undo a nut, wait, replace nut and fill oil isn't something that should cost

608 2018-10-22 22:44:30 @jaketapper I heard that Trump is working with some big name oil companies to try and drill oil in the Arctic.  Have you heard anything about this? If so why isn't it covered more given the current threat of our earth climate change?
609 2018-10-22 22:44:17 Saudi Arabia possess about 18% of the world's proven oil reserves and is the world's biggest oil exporter, Western powers have stressed that Saudi Arabia plays a crucial role in maintaining security in the Middle East and combating extremism and terrorism.
610 2018-10-22 22:44:11 Bill C-69 seems like a bunch of vague gibberish. I don’t see anything in it that really solves anything. As weak as the conservatives are on everything it’s fair to criticize the weak leadership of the Liberals in this case. We are underselling our oil.

627 2018-10-22 22:41:56 We Portuguese people soak a piece of bread in olive oil and use it as an appetizer. In some fancy restaurantes they use different types of olive oil so you can taste the differences. It's becoming a cult similar to the wine.

629 2018-10-22 22:41:48 I double cleanse - use a cleansing balm / oil to remove makeup, then cleanse with a gentle foaming cleanser. Yes ditch the gritty scrubs, those actually cause more issues. If you like the gritty scrub feeling, use it once every week or every 2 weeks, but overall an acid is better
630 2018-10-22 22:41:45 Hey sis. Nothing special, exfoliate with a brown sugar and coconut oil scrub 2-3 times a week, Clinique 3 step routine twice a day. Sunscreen and coconut oil are really the plug.
631 2018-10-22 22:41:40 Building processing plants close to the oil and gas would accomplish the same thing without a nation-long ecological time bomb to accomplish it. Some Notley lady ran on this a few years ago but has been stymied by both corporate interests and the feds.

645 2018-10-22 22:40:12 So, idk if it'll help (i haven't tried it yet) but two things have been suggested to me. 1) CBD oil and 2) a winter hobby (i'm gonna try running). Obviously I know the 2nd wont be a cure-all, it just might help a bit. If not- i'm always around to listen xo

By the way, is this guy orignaly from IRAN?

656 2018-10-22 22:39:05 Daily tip: If you want to avoid eggplants absorbing too much oil when you fry them, try the following. First, peel them, slice them, salt them, and wait 15 minutes. After you’ve done that, brush them with egg whites. Fry them until they’re golden brown and enjoy!

664 2018-10-22 22:38:15 Well that’s wishful thinking honestly. They have billions of oil dollars. One way or another, they will get them. Might as well be from us. You can’t change behavior without engagement.
665 2018-10-22 22:38:07 We can't switch off of oil fast enough.
666 2018-10-22 22:38:05 So should we stop drilling everywhere else too? Our gas prices are through the roof because of your taxes. Apparently we need more oil.
667 2018-10-22 22:38:03 I told this woman don’t park in my drive way because her car is leaking oil. She did it anyway. Now I’m going to Lowe’s to clean that shit. Respect people’s house!

never shows you how and then this repeats itself in 3 months
680 2018-10-22 22:36:14 The greens are so blinded by stopping and killing the CDN resource sector that they are willing to overlook the atrocities perpetrated by the Saudi’s rather than support pipelines that would not only allow eastern Canada to use CDN oil but get our ethical oil to global markets
681 2018-10-22 22:36:08 when you’re little they teach you to not squeeze your juice boxes. you should listen. i just got olive oil all in my eyes and they’re burning and i can’t see. it’s also all in my hair and clothes and all over my kitchen.
682 2018-10-22 22:36:04 Want a way to re-cover it, why not seize 6.3b in the company's that owe us tax payers. You already own a pipeline why not a auto plant. Once again no Bail out for oil workers. The only good thing I saw come out of the east was the sun       # FFS
683 2018-10-22 22:36:03 You mean you're on socialized medicine? I mean it's ok for you to have heathcare, not others. And please use fish oil and vitamins when you get cancer, that'll do the trick!
684 2018-10-22 22:35:58 Forty-five years ago, Saudi Arabia and its allies cut off oil supplies to the United States over its support for Israel. Oil prices quadrupled, delivering a huge shock to the global economy.  Saudi Arabia is threatening to raise oil prices again to anywhere between 200 to 400
685 2018-10-22 22:35:57 It’s amazing to watch Obama speak obviously enthralled crowd as he lies as usual through his teeth! How can people be that uninformed they think healthcare costs went down under the snake oil salesman? as they bob their heads? They’re like little robots!
686 2018-10-22 22:35:55 Saudi has a solid hold on OPEC which is really the oil part
687 2018-10-22 22:35:51 I always offer them a quart of oil from my trunk, and the walk straight away.
688 2018-10-22 22:35:42 Get injunction on the voter suppression & if unlawful hold Kemp responsible.
If all the swampinesses of the devolving @GOP get exposed they will lose yet another chunk of the dwindling base. Many of '16 voters have realized they were sold "snake oil". 
#VOTE @cnn
@staceyabrams
689 2018-10-22 22:35:25 Yet the current gov’t is still pressing ahead with the arms deal with the Saudi’s AND we are still giving them gibs of $$ for oil....
690 2018-10-22 22:35:12 Sounds like he has a CBD oil deficiency.
691 2018-10-22 22:35:00 قبل اسبوع جيت من باريس آخ بس
692 2018-10-22 22:34:54 So many emotions today guess I’ll oil up to support myself from being a emotional wreck
693 2018-10-22 22:34:36 What?! @PepsiCo STILL profits from exploitation #palmoil? Tell CEO @IndraNooyi to end her deals with palm oil villains @Indofood now
694 2018-10-22 22:34:25 Last govt spent on big roads and not on public transport alternatives to the oil companies ransome for the price of fuel the workers must pay.
695 2018-10-22 22:34:17 Every gas pump should clearly state where the refined oil came from.
696 2018-10-22 22:33:58 We hear you. This is a really important issue and we’ve been driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years.  We’re on track to meet our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.
697 2018-10-22 22:33:45 Good luck Sophie!! Add oil 
698 2018-10-22 22:33:40 Currently cooking a chicken that gas minced garlic.... chili sauce.... grape jelly olive oil and some salt and pepper because I need something new tonight besides grilled chicken
699 2018-10-22 22:33:39 Bro I, thought lagos has oil and gas?
700 2018-10-22 22:33:35 Coconut oil! Hydrates while its at it too
701 2018-10-22 22:33:33 Apparently Turkey has evidence and is threatening to out them if they don't spill the beans. But they control the oil so everyone else is afraid to talk. Sad how a human life is not worth much on the diplomatic scene.
702 2018-10-22 22:33:32 Literally: to sell oil
703 2018-10-22 22:33:31 I shaved my legs & rubbed coconut oil on my body i feels like a bad bitch
704 2018-10-22 22:33:27 damn i love to wake up covered in sweat and oil and feeling like a gross piece of shit for the entire day t. """people""" who shower at night
705 2018-10-22 22:33:21 @BarackObama the snake oil salesman is back.
706 2018-10-22 22:33:18 Sonic and Knuckles are much like oil and water.
707 2018-10-22 22:33:15 Pure stupidity..... cancel the arms deal , and it will be replaced with another vendor before Trudeau hangs up the phone ... cancel some oil contracts if you want to cut the Saudis .. canceling the arms deal inflicts more damage on Canada than it does SA
708 2018-10-22 22:33:14 i don’t know who needs to hear this but ... getcho oil changed
709 2018-10-22 22:33:03 Take note of positioning by Russia and Turkish aligned camps to buy oil from Russia or Iran instead of SA. A poke in the eye for USA.
710 2018-10-22 22:33:02 Oil industry is not our only industry, it's like 5% of our total gdp.
711 2018-10-22 22:33:00 This is a very real demographic for a number of us. Hallmark could easily sell us greeting cards that were nothing more than raggedy envelopes folded in half that said “I love you” and “I took your car. Can you take mine to get the oil changed.”
712 2018-10-22 22:32:57 The Canadian association of oil well drillers makes it so guys drilling 500m tvd with flocc water get paid the same as guys drilling to the core in northern BC. Sounds like a union to me boys, fuckin pussies. Lol jk
713 2018-10-22 22:32:52 نحن لانريد الستر على القتله الله ينصر الحق فهو يعلو ولا يعلا عليه.. المسيئ ان ملايين المسلمين قتلو وشردو دمهم ليس اغلا من دم خاشقجي؟ ولكن استغلال القضيه لمطامح شخصيه كبير واليم
714 2018-10-22 22:32:40 I finally took a shower in my own bathroom and then immediately gave myself a burning rash with a cinnamon perfume oil - probably should have checked it was skin safe first........
715 2018-10-22 22:32:36 The Damaged hot oil treatment! It definitely worked :)
716 2018-10-22 22:32:33 I’m so high, tell me how I put hair growth oil on one of my wigs
717 2018-10-22 22:32:22 Okay wow maybe I should have gone easy on the 5yrs out of date olbas oil sniffing, I can breathe through my nose it’s just a bit tingly now
718 2018-10-22 22:32:14 I jus buy a Tesla and reduce my personal dependence of foreign oil.
719 2018-10-22 22:32:14 $100 oil change im sick 
720 2018-10-22 22:32:11 There is no one on the planet interested in that sludge coming out of Fort Mac. We have to practically give it away to the Yanks as it is. What the fuck is a pipeline gonna do if no one wants the garbage oil that comes out at the end of it?!
721 2018-10-22 22:32:04 Why is Eastern Canada still buying Saudi Arabia oil,  maybe they should be purchasing Canadian Oil,  oh right Liberals ensured Eastern pipeline was cancelled.
722 2018-10-22 22:31:56 Getting that oil from there in nemesis, ah the memories...
723 2018-10-22 22:31:32 It can get away with anything. It has oil.
724 2018-10-22 22:31:30 If she supports foreign oil. She’s hardly an environmentalist.
725 2018-10-22 22:31:27 we got szechwan the other night and the leftovers have just been growing more and more powerful in our fridge, soaking in chili oil 
726 2018-10-22 22:31:21 Um... only if you’re part of the 1%. 

The cost of living is on the rise and wages are flat. 

Winter is coming and oil/gas is creeping up.
727 2018-10-22 22:31:11 ...because high-ranking Liberals & their cronies own the tankers bringing the oil to the Maritimes, that’s why!.....
728 2018-10-22 22:31:08 I swear by coconut oil, it does wonders! 
729 2018-10-22 22:31:05 Donald Trump: US will build up nuclear arsenal: ANOTHA PHUK'N WARMONGER LIKE "OIL WAR CRIMINAL" GEORGIE BOY BUSHWHACKER !! ONLY THIS ONE IS A REAL CHICKEN SHIT BAS'TURD' ! A 5 TIME DRAFT DODGER WITH "BONE SPURS" IN HIS HEAD INSTEAD OF PHUK'N BRAINS !!!
730 2018-10-22 22:31:04 Which asset classes are the best investments now? Stocks fair/over valued. Bonds weak. Real estate weak. Oil topped out. Commodities flat. International stocks weak. What's an investor to do?
731 2018-10-22 22:30:58 The government of India has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Caroline Manzo in a gabardine wig.
732 2018-10-22 22:30:54 Me: h-
My dad: have you checked the oil in your car
733 2018-10-22 22:30:35 || Yeah, I drew the standard oil octopus cartoon minus of the details on paper than transferred it onto the wall and painted what I could of it that I could reach before someone else had to paint the rest. I walked in like a boss and left like one whoops. I didn't do well on the>
734 2018-10-22 22:30:35 And yet, we imported 80% of our oil in 2017 from 5 countries. Care to guess who made that list. Bottom line is if they hold their oil, oir prices will double in a month

to make me sweeter
738 2018-10-22 22:30:08 A very disingenuous statement .... cancelling the arms deal hurts Canadians more than SA , cancel a few oil tanker purchase orders , then you have some meaningful sanctions
739 2018-10-22 22:30:05 No task at all. He should just enjoy his short accidental time as PM. He is probably one of the most lightweight PMs we have ever had. Snake oil as far as the eye can see.
740 2018-10-22 22:29:32 Thought $500 was enough for Colorado til I went in for an oil change and left with a $250 service bill 
741 2018-10-22 22:29:29 @donlemon took it. He just purchased 3 in 1 oil in the 55 gallon drum size and 50 shower curtains.
742 2018-10-22 22:29:21 I'm confident in my prediction, especially given that my previous call in early 2017 for rising oil prices played out as expected. Further, calling gas prices is relatively easier than calling oil prices due to seasonality.
743 2018-10-22 22:29:20 every president since Reagan (don't know about the current one, though) has made 'reducing dependence on foreign oil' part of their State of the Union speech, when talking about beefing up national security.
744 2018-10-22 22:29:12 I don’t wanna be rich, just like “change my oil when I’m supposed to” rich
745 2018-10-22 22:29:09 Nope. Shouldn’t be buying oil from them either but there you go.
746 2018-10-22 22:29:00 Depends on the flavor.  If it’s rosemary & olive oil or fire roasted tomato, the number is limitless.  Add olive tampenade or a great cheese OH.... don’t forget a good red wine and that’s a meal for me!!!
747 2018-10-22 22:28:55 I don’t think China has the warm and fuzzies for you after the ridiculous trade war you started, they’ve stopped buying our oil and soy beans, ouch!
748 2018-10-22 22:28:31 Anti-depressants aren’t drugs. They’re legal and prescribed. Just as CBD oil is. I know many people who use CBD for many different reasons. One is not getting high. It doesn’t get me high. You need something with THC like Rick Simpson oil to get high.
749 2018-10-22 22:28:26 But the US isn’t following suit. $1B arms deal done! The GOP doesn’t remember the 15 Saudi citizens and the nation that carried out a plan that caused the events of 9/11 and a decades long war. All in the name of securing our oil rights, and the East, of course.
750 2018-10-22 22:28:16 Add in the Bush family owns so much stock in oil from Saudi & vis-versa... Guess everyone truly has forgotten 9/11, by everyone I mean Trumpers...
751 2018-10-22 22:28:16 Definitely mix in some CBD oil.
752 2018-10-22 22:28:02 Can you call it an "essential oil?"
753 2018-10-22 22:27:49 Huh. Just been reading Anna Jones' 'modern way to eat' cookbook, apparently mushy peas with a bit of oil counts as hummus now.
754 2018-10-22 22:27:43 A passage that enchants me from #theodyssey Book 6: “Meanwhile her mother packed/a box of all kinds of delicious food and a goatskin/filled with wine, and the girls climbed onto the wagon,/and her mother gave her the food, along with a golden/flask of olive oil,“
755 2018-10-22 22:27:42 Don't be surprised if the #US, the #UK and #France and more continue to turn a blind eye to the barbaric medieval violence of #SaudiArabia, as we all know it's all about the #money, it's all about the #oil and in reality no one gives a shit about morality of the Saudi murders.
756 2018-10-22 22:27:41 A UN investigation will be ineffectual, and a waste of time. The only action that will have any effect are sanctions and suspending trade and arms deals. But the West hasn't the balls, or the oil.
757 2018-10-22 22:27:31 Any quick reasons why they are fake news? Haven't you written something similar
758 2018-10-22 22:26:31 Maybe instead of regime changing oil rich nations we should focus on the govs south of the border? U ever wonder why there’s no talk of regime change in Mexico??? Maybe the USA wants it that way for all the drugs to cross into the border?

#maga
759 2018-10-22 22:26:30 Try potato peeler ribbon of orange outer skin instead of slice lime or lemon.  Gives so much oil, you can leave it in for the 2nd one 
760 2018-10-22 22:26:19 @teslanomicsco SMOKE AND MIRRORS !!!  
Benny, please don't confuse us by throwing in fuel savings to try to lessen the blow of the high cost Model 3. Fuel savings depends cost of electricity, weather & driving style. Next thing will be the savings in oil changes and timing chains
761 2018-10-22 22:26:14 Who tryna change my oil 
762 2018-10-22 22:26:11 After a trip to Norcia Italy, I learned I could buy black truffles and have them shipped to the US.  In addition to the truffles, the slightly salty liquid that sits in the bottom of the shipping jar is far better to use than artificial oil for flavoring dishes.
763 2018-10-22 22:26:04 My pussy hurts so I just ate a bunch of weed oil in preparation for dilating
764 2018-10-22 22:26:01 First time I’ve ever gotten an oil change where they haven’t offered me a new air filter
765 2018-10-22 22:25:51 Avocado oil is amazing!!!
766 2018-10-22 22:25:46 Yeah eh.
And if they're suddenly being righteous..... Stop buy their oil
It's like we don't have any of our own
767 2018-10-22 22:25:41 4 oil rigs with week to October 19... 875 million, highest since March,2015... trading today: West Texas International made futures ahead deliveries in Houston... National: A.) Iowa basketball coach admits to sexually exploiting 400 boys...
768 2018-10-22 22:25:39 Using an oil that has cocunut oil after you shower or anytime you apply heat to your hair helps a lot! I’ve bleached mine probably like 5 times in the past couple of years and it’s pretty good (not super healthy of course) because of the oil!

771 2018-10-22 22:24:50 Oklahoma State Question 801 is a sham attempt by the Oklahoma oiligarchy to pretend they care about funding public education by shuffling funds  around so pressure will be off of them to pay a 7% Gross Production Tax on oil and gas. #VoteNoOn801 #OklaEd #Restore7PercentGPT
772 2018-10-22 22:24:43 I’d rather try you with oil
773 2018-10-22 22:24:43 Look for a balm made with natural substances. 
Key ingredients that moisturize your lips include coconut oil or butter, shea butter, and vitamin E oil.
To make your own healthy balm, simply melt together 2 tablespoons coconut oil and 1 tablespoon beeswax.
774 2018-10-22 22:24:40 It depends what u re cooking if its stew then add oil
775 2018-10-22 22:24:38 That and subprime loans are being repackaged and sold at double the rates. A nature reserve is getting a new oil pipeline. You know all the real violations of citizens rights that apply to everyone.
776 2018-10-22 22:24:29 The Album will soon discover Crude oil 
777 2018-10-22 22:24:23 @cbcthenational well if it bothers the CBC so much then start advocating we stop importing all foreign oil period and go balls out on energy east.
778 2018-10-22 22:24:18 You would not want to try that with the twin steer they have the turning circle of a oil tanker
779 2018-10-22 22:23:36 Aye i sometimes buy one and its all covered with minging pink mould on the sides after 1 week! I think if you fill it to tip wi olive oil it never goes off but.
780 2018-10-22 22:23:34 Me: “I keep breaking out like crazy!”
@sarah_nicccole : “Well you do have that oil acne free wash!” 
781 2018-10-22 22:23:31 Evansville was THE place to go when I lived near there. It was that or hang out on oil drums in the corn fields. 
782 2018-10-22 22:23:29 This is why #CA45, home to a most beautiful stretch of the California coast must vote for @katieporteroc and send her to Congress. Her opponent, @MimiWaltersCA has aligned herself with Zinke, Trump and Big Oil's plan to drill along our coastline!

787 2018-10-22 22:22:42 Dipstick is low on oil.
788 2018-10-22 22:22:24 Like the Saudis give a shit what the US or UK think: as long as there’s oil in them there deserts, there’ll be customers, who then prop up their military spending.
789 2018-10-22 22:22:22 Another Scrub;
Mix 1 teaspoon honey or aloe with 1 teaspoon olive or coconut oil.
Rub the mixture into your lips.
Let the serum sit and absorb into your lips for ten minutes.
Rinse away the excess serum with warm water

PAY IN GOLD and then BUY OIL.

801 2018-10-22 22:21:04 Canada is the world's #5 oil exporter.  Of course we can survive without Saudi oil. What a strange question.
802 2018-10-22 22:21:02 I just referred to the "Texas Oil, Gas, Aircraft Maintenance and Software Licensing Act of 2006" in an actual lawyer email and I'm not even a tiny bit ashamed.

810 2018-10-22 22:19:46 They bring wealth to big oil shareholders at expense of the planet which is on verge of hitting a point of no return.

814 2018-10-22 22:19:23 Agreed. Look into where all are oil/gas is going. Hint: it's not here.

825 2018-10-22 22:18:23 Oil, money and sand is all the Saudis Regime has.  Let them eat it.  Stop propping them up.  Like there's been decades of stability in the Middle East anyway....
826 2018-10-22 22:18:04 Broccoli, cauliflower, red cabbage, red onions, garlic, ginger, turmeric, Celtic salt, coconut oil, free range eggs .. all stir fried together..
827 2018-10-22 22:17:57 I accidentally was added to OSBA’s Oil and Gas Law listserve and I feel like I’m watching an episode of Dallas.
828 2018-10-22 22:17:52 Leaves press conference and fills her car and heats home with Saudi oil, gas.
829 2018-10-22 22:17:44 You are half way there! All you need now is olive oil, cooked pasta, some sort of frozen veg, some anchovies, some cheese?
830 2018-10-22 22:17:26 I’m on this new diet called starving myself, it’s amazing
831 2018-10-22 22:17:15 The formula for all crashes in the last 120 years:
Oil falls more than 10% (back below $62)
Gold rises more than 10% (back above $1300)
Bond & interest rates approach major share yields (US- yes).
$USD Falls ($AUD rises)
+ EVENT = CRASH

833 2018-10-22 22:16:48 Hey Obama, you “ think” you should actually say to people what is true or do you KNOW you’re supposed to say to people what is true? What a talk out of the side of your mouth snake oil salesman for a President you were, Obama.
834 2018-10-22 22:16:47 And in case you forgot I stood up against big oil for you Americans. I went to standing rock to stand up for all rights in America.
835 2018-10-22 22:16:42 Ending the tyranny of oil and ushering in the age of clean energy by toppling the Boston Citgo sign like the statue of Saddam Hussein as everyone boos us
836 2018-10-22 22:16:34 I ran out of oil in my pen , I be getting high asf with that shit
837 2018-10-22 22:16:32 Its not because they are muslims, its because they have oil shitlord. Take that away theyd be treated like shit like the rest of the muslim world  gets treated/treats eachother.
838 2018-10-22 22:16:31 No blood for oil!!!!!
839 2018-10-22 22:16:18 Try castor oil, hair oil, and I want to take a moment to thank them.
840 2018-10-22 22:16:15 Better than rhetoric how about stop buying SA oil, build a pipeline so we can use our own ethical oil.
841 2018-10-22 22:16:10 Oil usually but plant works too! Prefer the oil as I can take it with me and get no questions.
842 2018-10-22 22:16:06 Wow.
If that's the case I have some snake oil to sell you. Super cheap.
843 2018-10-22 22:16:05 I mean, I feel like she’s taking the correct measures to put oil in her car.
844 2018-10-22 22:16:04 All the ads act like grass roots but when you read the small print it’s all major oil companies!
845 2018-10-22 22:15:55 I’ve always wondered , do they put the truffle oil in the pantry as a pitfall for the chefs ?
846 2018-10-22 22:15:50 I get hempseed oil with my supper.  It's done wonders for my coat!
847 2018-10-22 22:15:36 It never rained that night. It looks like maybe an oil spill or a stain, but doesn't shine. Just some darkened asphalt. I'm too scared to inspect it.
I don't look out windows at night anymore. Maybe it was a curse, because 7 years later, my brother died. Maybe it was coincidence.
848 2018-10-22 22:15:14 Well I'm here now, and I'm painting. If I don't report back every hour, I've either given up on Twitter again or passed out to oil fumes.
849 2018-10-22 22:15:02 Nooooo my cat just stole half a beef burger out of the hot frying pan! My mum is raging, I’m cry laughing omg actually eating it while it’s cooking with boiling hot oil he’s so so weird

852 2018-10-22 22:14:05 I had a friend tell me that "BIG OIL" has paid someone to keep a 200 mpg carburetor off the market. After WWII there was a 80 mpg carburetor  same thing happened to that
853 2018-10-22 22:14:01 Wavyleaf Balsam: Flowers have 10 petals, are bell-shaped, and attract geese. Tastes of chili oil. Fruit a sidequest.
854 2018-10-22 22:14:00 Europe wouldnt have this so called problem if we hadnt bombed the living shite in there country's, just so america and the west as a whole could get there oil
855 2018-10-22 22:14:00 Last night was full of strange dreams. Don’t mix Benadryl and CBD oil kids.
856 2018-10-22 22:13:57 Might keep an eye out for different transmissio oil
857 2018-10-22 22:13:55 I beg to differ with you. Canada has the cleanest air in the world. We have more forests, and we do t do dirty oil and hide it behind warehouses
858 2018-10-22 22:13:53 RT
Lots of famous persons from foreign countries often say “Japan is so fascinating, but people should change (overtime working, shyness etc.) blah blah blah...”. He never says things like that . He only says “Oil the bicycle brakes” lol
859 2018-10-22 22:13:50 Iranians are not Arab. They're Persian. 

And fuck Pat Robertson, House of Saud and war, especially religious wars or neocolonial wars for oil.
860 2018-10-22 22:13:49 EMERGENCY IN Colorado! Just heard 63% of voters plan to vote yes on Amendment 74!  This is BAD NEWS.  It will CRIPPLE local government.  It is a transfer of $ from taxpayers to Oil & Gas, & more. Read on for explanation. Then retweet and spread the word and VOTE NO on 74.
861 2018-10-22 22:13:47 If you DON'T block oil soaked trolls, you need to! They've sold their souls... I REALLY enjoy twitter now... Great info and community.   Remember people! Haters are mostly funded by dirty energy...they have TRILLIONS and are spending bucks to delay our transition to clean energy
862 2018-10-22 22:13:39 Great so Freeland will send another tweet or two with a grumpy face emoji? Maybe grow a backbone and stop buying their oil. Oops forgot Irving has 1/2 your Atlantic MPs in their pocket.
863 2018-10-22 22:13:37 Lmao Daniel is like “bitch I’ve showed you how to check your oil like 500 times”  I just want him to do it I know how muahahhahaha
864 2018-10-22 22:13:21 Use vitamin E oil for scarring so it can help it fade away....my baby nephew busted his whole nose right down the middle and now you can't even see anything!!! It helps!!!
865 2018-10-22 22:13:20 He's selling snake oil!  They all are!  Vote Republican!
866 2018-10-22 22:12:57 まさかのそこから!!?ありがとうございます
867 2018-10-22 22:12:54 I dey die. Oil rig koraaa ye di how many days na etu?
868 2018-10-22 22:12:48 Ate too much Chinese food so I had a massive shower and covered myself in bare aftershave for no reason. Laid in bed now with lots of  oil incense burning. Is this what being an amazing lady feels like
869 2018-10-22 22:12:44 So sad people have this attitude. I gave up meat a year ago and replaced it with cold pressed olive oil and I lost 15 lbs and I have never felt more healthy! If only the world knew how bad meat is for us...
870 2018-10-22 22:12:44 I have no belief in this after the Klein error. Of course the Kenney is a bit brighter than the Klein guy. I imagine when there is no money and he can't turn water into oil there will be major restructuring cuz no PST in his mind. @OilGasCanada going downhill. Will be neat.
871 2018-10-22 22:12:38 Oil change done .. now gotta get 4 new tires 
872 2018-10-22 22:12:32 I think it's time for "think tanks" to be brought under regulatory oversight. These charlatans who are presented to the general public as academia, but without any stringent peer review, are clearly often little more than snake oil salesmen.
873 2018-10-22 22:12:13 Hi Ralph, they're averaging 0.85kg/day. They're on Heiferpro - a 27%protein 20%oil powder, made for Wynnstay by Volac
874 2018-10-22 22:12:03 Oven roasted garlic heads, drizzled olive oil, sprinkle parmesan. Slice off the top, use a butter knife to scoop and spread on crusty bread with your choice of chopped tomatoes, basil, provolone

876 2018-10-22 22:11:31 Don't listen to this guy. One of them oil money fans.
877 2018-10-22 22:11:28 Heat a large pot on the stove over medium high heat. Add in olive oil and saute onion in the olive oil for about 5 minutes, until softened. Pour in chicken broth, crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, sugar, fennel, oregano, salt, pepper, basil, and parsley and garlic...

880 2018-10-22 22:11:05 to properly control it

Ask how long you can still use the tires and what kind of tires it has (winter/summer/all season)

Remember to ask when the last oil change was and what type of oil they used

Get a car that did not have an accident before
881 2018-10-22 22:11:04 Am leaving for striking oil, build Corolla cars
882 2018-10-22 22:11:02 Doesn't Saudi/KSA, UAE have currencies based off USD? Any easy way to let them off considering the oil reserve currency used?
883 2018-10-22 22:11:01 "He could shoot someone on fifth avenue " and 50% believe the snake oil conman.
884 2018-10-22 22:10:59 Have you tried the Orange Olive Oil? Surprisingly delicious!!!!
885 2018-10-22 22:10:53 I've heard using baby oil is a good way to get it out.
886 2018-10-22 22:10:51 Dear @TheEllenShow,
My happiness for today; @IHOP , library day @RinChupeco ‘s #thesuffering (which is AMAZING btw), and my baby Honda got his oil changed! #todaysbeenagoodday #youneedtoreadthisbook #dearellen #positivelythinking
887 2018-10-22 22:10:51 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
888 2018-10-22 22:10:49 Wish I knew how to tell the %, I make about 30 serving with 1oz.
this was made with 1oz of God's green crack, using coconut oil ...

893 2018-10-22 22:10:09 It was delicious! For the sauce: water+soy sauce+rice vinegar+cornstarch+sugar and then wisk. There’s measurements but I eyeball mine. 

Coat chicken in cornstarch then toss in pan until crispy (canola oil). Take them out, then add veggies+garlic+ginger. Mix sauce & chicken back.

895 2018-10-22 22:09:53 @PetrosAndMoney Oil Can Boyd
896 2018-10-22 22:09:51 Everybody is NOT YOUR ASSIGNMENT. Ask God before you waste your oil. Don’t pour more than you need to .
897 2018-10-22 22:09:41 Remember of course that some of their oil is our oil.  This is an arbitrage opportunity for them, buy cheap and sell expensive.  Thank you Liberals and NDP.
898 2018-10-22 22:09:39 Fry with minced up garlic, oil and anchovy.. yum yum pigs bum!
899 2018-10-22 22:09:39 And why is that then, when geologically is clear there is oil and gas? Isn't this just another way to mess up with taxes abd where resources should go to? Old tricks
900 2018-10-22 22:09:37 Oh yes.  Olive oil great olives pasta cheese   Yum.
901 2018-10-22 22:09:35 Vaping cbd oil is like the feeling of taking a hot bath and hugging your mom put together
902 2018-10-22 22:09:34 Exactly.  Stop all cash remittances from the US to Mexico.  That's $25,000,000,000+ per year they get from the US - roughly equivalent to what they make in their oil industry.  That'll get somebody's attention.
903 2018-10-22 22:09:31 The only thing that would make that better Eric is if you showed up wearing nothing but chaps and a light coat of oil
904 2018-10-22 22:09:28 Baba Yaga. " Mother has sent it a burnt crust; but she poured oil on and married again.
905 2018-10-22 22:09:27 Feel like absolute shit, was in urgent care today. Still ran errands and made dinner. Realized my car is leaking oil again so I’m off to the dealership tomorrow (on my day off to rest and take prednisone all day)  Adulting don’t stop for nothing!
906 2018-10-22 22:09:20 I only accept oil if Saudi want to bribe me
907 2018-10-22 22:08:57 The blue juice though!!! And don't get me started on Omega fest and that damn OIL!!
908 2018-10-22 22:08:37 Someone should just buy my perfume oil thats all. 20mls for 6500 with extra two 5mls bottle.
909 2018-10-22 22:08:24 Oh god yes there's lazy person's chopped garlic in oil you can buy now and it's amazing - never goes off, use it in EVERYTHING
910 2018-10-22 22:08:07 @NabhaanRizwan just finished #theinformer brilliant performance, pathos, wit, pace. It will stay with me for a long time. Coconut hair oil, cue tears.
911 2018-10-22 22:08:01 How do you journalists cover this insanity every day ? It must involve a lot of drinking . To confront every day that fifty percent of this country believes a snake oil conman , must be so frustrating .
912 2018-10-22 22:07:55 We must not try to force other tribes to join in Biafra. We don't need any South south state if they do not want, oil is curse to any nation.Japan, South Korea,Singapore, China, India,Taiwan don't have oil see where they are, we have the best human resources in Africa,I support.
913 2018-10-22 22:07:28 The oil in these new vape pens I got.... sheesh 
914 2018-10-22 22:07:01 Oh god I just put some olive oil ear drops in my ear and I was lying in bed and the cat came up and started licking my ear  #vom #nokitty #dontdothat
915 2018-10-22 22:07:00 If Wales and Scotland are so weak, as you say, why does the English establishment wish for the union to remain?  The fact is that Scotland and Cymru quenches the thirst of the English governed union with its free oil and water.
916 2018-10-22 22:06:52 I should oil my motorcycle... #MinkBot
917 2018-10-22 22:06:42 Just so long as they only accept dollars for their oil and maintain the petro-dollar system ,   If that changes then they’re next in line for regime change war
918 2018-10-22 22:06:38 @VassyKapelos listening to your show on @SXMRadio but am very disappointed that not 1 member of your “power panel” mentioned that we should be suspending Saudi Oil Imports and replace with domestic West CDN Oil in response to #Kashoggi
919 2018-10-22 22:06:30 Steep Hill's Gaudino, regarding #marijuana testing failures: "A lot of times, people are failing not because their product isn’t good, but because they’re mixing it with shit that isn’t good." He mentioned olive oil as one example.
920 2018-10-22 22:06:20 It's one thing conservatives are good at for sure, they're all at it. I've lost track of all the vested interests and blatant pocket linings going on. When you see peaceful protesters jailed by a judge with ties to the oil industry its clear that the judiciary is also compromised
921 2018-10-22 22:06:18 Yung tipong puti rubber ko sa braces tapos kumain kami sa inasal kahapon tas pinagtripan namin yung olive oil tas ngayon karma ako nagdikitan sa rubbers ko yung kulay orange

My stomach is nervously burning inside

Meltdown, iroha
926 2018-10-22 22:06:04 Thanks Troy! Yes we will lol
927 2018-10-22 22:05:52 Use any hair oil like olive oil or coconut oil on damp hair. Applying oil or product on damp hair absorbs better.
928 2018-10-22 22:05:48 Ted Cruz now has a new TV campaign ad, touting his ability to increase teachers' pay(?!?!) -- I guess he was getting diminishing returns from his previous ad, in which he boasted what a lickspittle toady he is to the oil and gas industry...
929 2018-10-22 22:05:36 Make brownies with coconut oil omg so fluffy
930 2018-10-22 22:05:30 How can they worsen? Alberta unemployment rate is closing on 7.0 Calgary has an unemployment rate of 8.2 Edmonton is closing on 7.0 and were losing 40 million a day in oil sales not to mention more jobs if @RachelNotley doesn’t fix it.
931 2018-10-22 22:04:37 Do they wrestle in oil? If not, no thanks :)
932 2018-10-22 22:04:36 So glad I took the day off...Getting oil change and the later tonight I’m going to see #Halloween 
933 2018-10-22 22:04:23 The same guy who had 2 DWIs, a burglary charge, an ethics complaint against him in 2006, voted for tax increase on oil and voted against tax relief for victims of Hurricane Harvey #VetoBeto

936 2018-10-22 22:04:05 Why yes, I DO hate snake oil salesmen. Can you blame me? Bubble of hate? Your timeline reads like one big infowars promo.
937 2018-10-22 22:03:34 I was thinking of using Pachouli oil, as I have some, It stays active a really long time. But, it's sort of an India fragrance... so I'm not sure it's a good idea for clothes I wear where people would think... What's that smell????
938 2018-10-22 22:03:31 My hair is feeling so good like idk what I did idk if is the coconut oil idk if is the pear I used in my hair before I put in the locs idk but I'm here for it nah complain
939 2018-10-22 22:03:25 I wish they would legalize CBD oil in Nebraska.

4) Eat lots of Cajun food 
#myramonday
944 2018-10-22 22:02:53 But the NY Fed said that "oil prices went down due to anticipated increases in supply." That is Fed-speak for we took them down with HFT because we thought they were getting too high.
945 2018-10-22 22:02:52 Coconut oil for sure. Hands down.
946 2018-10-22 22:02:47 If my mother doesn’t answer my phone call and come with me to get an oil change I’m going to end her shit!
947 2018-10-22 22:02:45 If you believe @RachelNotley is doing anything for the energy industry then explain to us what she’s done? Has she pulled out of a carbon tax that she promised as part of a “social licensing “ has she threatened to stop oil? What has she done to the energy economy!! Sad
948 2018-10-22 22:02:31 That's because they weaponized oil under Eisenhower.
949 2018-10-22 22:02:26 Can she do an oil change and rotate my tires?
950 2018-10-22 22:02:24 "BP, bringing oil to US shores."
951 2018-10-22 22:02:21 Personally, I think EV’s are a major national security issue, reducing USA and our allies dependence on Russian and Middle East oil. USA spends almost 100 billion protecting oil supply line, better spent modernizing forces or reducing taxes, or budget deficits.
952 2018-10-22 22:02:18 I thought this was a joke holy shit have the brits just been huffing all that blood oil?????
953 2018-10-22 22:02:18 Minimum wage: Salary increment or reducing of oil price. Which among the two has positive impact on ordinary Nigerian ???

964 2018-10-22 22:01:07 Secret in the same way the Tory Government in the 70s had an assessment done on the economic viability of an independent Scotland with North Sea Oil, Or more recently the secret impact assessment  Brexit will have on Scotland?

966 2018-10-22 22:00:49 I should hope so given they jumped almost 20 cents per litre overnight on the Central Coast over the weekend. The oil companies know prices are falling so they jam the prices up now so they’re still overcharging next week when they “apply the discount “ to reflect lower oil price
967 2018-10-22 22:00:48 Libya has the world's 9th largest crude oil reserves. Libya has more crude oil than Nigeria.

969 2018-10-22 22:00:44 Dan A. Hughes oil company wasn’t the only problem. When they did unauthorized procedure, which we were trying to prevent at another location in the county, Florida administration didn’t disclose and began to avoid public meetings re drilling. Gov Scott lacks transparency.
970 2018-10-22 22:00:42 Oil is what funds the Saudi gov and their atrocities, why does the msm refuse to discuss the fact Canada supports Saudi by buying their oil over oil from our own country

976 2018-10-22 22:00:20 HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE WHEN OIL IS UP AND SO IS NATURAL GAS?
977 2018-10-22 22:00:11 The kind of ally that has some serious flaws. But one that buys $110 billion in weapons from us and increases/decreases oil output in alignment with economic sanctions on our adversaries. What was your position on the Iran nuke deal - a country instigating the war in Yemen.
978 2018-10-22 22:00:06 DFT offers a scale remediator, SCALE-SOLVE™, that has application possibilities from plungers, pumping units and even salt water disposals. SCALE-SOLVE™ also has a surfactant component that reduces surface tension improving oil/water/solid separation.
979 2018-10-22 21:59:46 We need to work harder to diversify our arms export base. And not solely rely on easy oil dollars.
980 2018-10-22 21:59:44 Attendant: what can we help you with

Me: I need an oil change and tires rotated

*dead eye stare from attendant*

Him: sir we take safety seriously. Get out.
981 2018-10-22 21:59:07 How does Pemex plan to "obtener productos destilados de mayor valor económico como gasolinas y diesel" from Bakken oil? Crappy gasoline, perhaps but diesel?

983 2018-10-22 21:59:03 So glad I stopped using coconut oil on my hair. Tbh it’s not good for hair

992 2018-10-22 21:57:52 // Turkish oil wrestling between them when
993 2018-10-22 21:57:48 So Saudi murders one guy and we are supposed to create an oil crisis and push Saudi into the Russian sphere of influence. Madness. #Newsnight
994 2018-10-22 21:57:40 Things are changing, the world is waking up & will become less dependant on your oil. 9/11, Yeman, murder in Turkey the world is waking up.  Surely it is time for freedom of the people in Saudia Arabia, an end to religous wars & respecting people for the good they do.
995 2018-10-22 21:57:37 Don't worry about an oil spill, the fukushima radiation should be on the west coast by next summer.
996 2018-10-22 21:57:21 Good. Get rid of Saudi influence in our own political nightmare. We don't need to sell them weapons or LAV's and we sure as ship don't need their oil when we have it all right here. The only thing Saudi leadership is? Caustic.

They want back in the world they need #humanrights
997 2018-10-22 21:57:09 it never once occured to me that olive oil is just pressed olives. what a philistine
998 2018-10-22 21:57:09 I finally got an oil change after not having one since March 
999 2018-10-22 21:57:00 I understand what you’re saying. This is not a normal situation. We are fighting fire with fire. This is not the normal fire we fight with water. This is a oil field fire. And the only way we snuff it out is with a bigger fire.
1000 2018-10-22 21:56:57 Wouldn't shock me if he colludes with big oil to artificially deflate the cost of gas to 1.99 a gallon the weekend before the election. They're capable of everything!
1001 2018-10-22 21:56:55 Kim, What dont you like? Soaring Economy, Businesses Booming, 6 Steel Factory's Back Open! Farmers Farming! We are Now The Oil & Energy LEADERS OF THE WORLD!

1002 2018-10-22 21:56:53 Wandered again to BBC, just in time to see a report from Yemen.
Dire sadness. The injured know it was Saudi airstrikes.
The GOP spew their anti-environment BS & we continue to be dependent on foreign oil & drug cartels. There must be 50 ways to duck & cover.

1004 2018-10-22 21:56:25 Samir, on Oct 15 I tweeted #Saudi cutting #oil #exports to U.S. unlikely because in 1973 Saudi oil profits supported a 6.6 million population, now it's +32 million & Saudis are in conflict w/multiple region rivals. I'd add #Trump/US probably won't do anything, actually don't care

1015 2018-10-22 21:54:52 Roy, as a YouTube video: What happens if you use Flex Seal as ENGINE OIL?
1016 2018-10-22 21:54:38 If anyone is being "untruthful" ...let's take a look at those Big Oil ads insinuating that FEDERALLY REGULATED aviation fuels, a LEGALLY EXCLUDED previous coal plant closure, EV airplanes and EV shipping vessels are somehow in existence or even up for debate=#MISLEADING
1017 2018-10-22 21:54:35 My son came across an article about your Lucas Oil Stadium....  well, okay, he's 8 years old so he may have had some help "coming across" it , but he was fascinated by the entire idea of it all.  Now he wants me to check for new players and additions about once a week!
1018 2018-10-22 21:54:35 A lot of people swear by castor oil and you can also take biotin! 
1019 2018-10-22 21:54:29 Just by retweeting and liking all things APC/PDP, one bloke is vexed on my timeline. Lol. 

I cook my stew with plenty oil and pepper. 
1020 2018-10-22 21:54:24 And remind ordinary taxpayer legal Cdns what infrastructure 30 days of World Price Oil would buy in each major city. #ISIStravellers are folks to pmjt but #albertaenergy  just nasty uneducated hewers who hate their air ,H20 and kids.

1022 2018-10-22 21:54:06 Weigh out ten teaspoons of olive oil then whisk briskly.
1023 2018-10-22 21:53:55 I think that’s the goal for the “we are global citizens” of the left. Secure the border now, That’s what I voted for in 2016 not 18 mid terms. We won’t wait long get it done!!!!
1024 2018-10-22 21:53:52 Go ahead, we don’t care. Where are you going to get your food?  Only 2% of your land is arable and over 80% of your food is imported.  SA relies on imports and being able to purchase land in other countries for farming.  Any idea how this could backfire??  We don’t need your oil!
1025 2018-10-22 21:53:50 Maybe Alberta would have an easier time selling their oil in eastern Canada if they started throwing gay people off buildings.
1026 2018-10-22 21:53:41 Also we are still extremely dependant on oil not only for transportation(which is arguably what has allowed the society to evolve so much) but also for a variety of things: from medicine to energy to everyday life. If we are to make a change, we should seek to pressure companies-
1027 2018-10-22 21:53:28 You're going to ask movie theatre employees wether or not the popcorn oil is butter or soy bean oil...? Riiiiight.
1028 2018-10-22 21:53:24 I really like the ability to do oil paintings on my iPad.
1029 2018-10-22 21:53:14 Need to oil Mother soon. Get all the hard-to-reach places.
1030 2018-10-22 21:53:11 lmao the oil dude asks my preference on what oil I want him to use, I thought all oils were the same??
1031 2018-10-22 21:52:52 At my day job, we have a drink called the Green Smoothie, which has spinach, banana puree, cucumbers, a little bit of water, coconut oil, apples, and strawberries. Probably more healthier than the weird latte that I make, but I need my coffee in the morning

1036 2018-10-22 21:52:21 Well, the issues pertain certain...power corruption. See, proven economical successes like oil derivates are much safer to bet than the still developing green energies. Also, the meat industry is by large one of the most contaminant agents on the world. But giving up meat is hard
1037 2018-10-22 21:52:16 Walmart stole my extra car key last oil change I got there.
1038 2018-10-22 21:52:01 All I see is carbs, colorants, preservatives, palm oil and high fructose corn syrup. Yum.
1039 2018-10-22 21:51:58 Well a $40 oil change turned into a $200 I don't even know what and my bank app stopped working so you can bet that I am now crying lol

1042 2018-10-22 21:51:48 Just think if you Liberals hadn't gutted Canadas oil industry and allowed shipment of Canadian oil east you would have some leverage against Saudi oil imports.But instead you are climate fraud cultists with nothing but bluster #cndpoli
1043 2018-10-22 21:51:41 Please who sells beard oil??
1044 2018-10-22 21:51:21 No need for western Canada oil. Newfoundland oil good enough for us. Just pass laws redirecting NL oil to Ontario and Quebec at premium price. 
1045 2018-10-22 21:51:18 It's interesting that Apple's new splash image is an oil slick.

Almost like @Apple is trying to tell us something.

We're using too much oil?
These phones are made with that oil?
Greed for oil will guarantee blood in the streets because OIL OIL OIL???

Fuck oil.
End oil.
1046 2018-10-22 21:51:11 Hahaha I'm so confused 

I went to Portugal

I saw people putting oil on their rice

Tried it

Had an orgasm

Came home 

Tried it again

Was sad
1047 2018-10-22 21:50:59 There’s an oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico that’s been leaking for 14 years. In 2004 Hurricane Ivan destroyed a pipeline and they haven’t fixed it. It spills 300-700 barrels of oil everyday.
1048 2018-10-22 21:50:50 As I’ve said before, the way the world handles this horrific murder will set moral standards for years to come...this is a watershed...time to break our addiction to oil..and leave the Saudis in the wilderness
1049 2018-10-22 21:50:49 Do you ever not feel tired when taking #CBD oil? Like does your body ever get used to it? Or are there other options that won't make me sleepy? My body is too sensitive.

1051 2018-10-22 21:50:24 I am excited about it.  I even absently took  a look into adding glow in the dark resin to the oil paint.  Just for an extra surprise when the lights go out.
1052 2018-10-22 21:50:17 Wait, today is 22nd Oct 2019, 3yrs 146days after Buhari was sworn in as president, 219days to be sworn in for a second term.
Has any of you heard of any scandal involving Tinubu in Buhari’s government? Any contract scandal, oil lifting, oil licenses, bribery etc?

Just curious
1053 2018-10-22 21:50:09 No

Olive oil available for purchase in England
1054 2018-10-22 21:50:08 i think it smells like skunk , if you are going to use it at least just use the cannabis oil. Also the oil doesn't make a person high but gives the health benefits
1055 2018-10-22 21:50:05 The only thing distinguishing this kind of snake oil salesmanship from fraud is the possible stupidity of the actor - as long as you can credibly claim to actually believe this BS, it’s probably fine to market stuff in this way.
1056 2018-10-22 21:49:56 Depending on how thick you want your mask to be. But honestly I used this when my acne got bad, but dark spots get organic rose hip oil! It cleared most of mine or at least lightened them

1059 2018-10-22 21:49:30 I chopped up some garlic and ginger and then poured hot oil on it so it would sorta cook, threw some other seasonings in and its a real good all purpose "make stuff taste good" sorta thing now.
1060 2018-10-22 21:49:23 There's some citrus sprays in pet shops that have worked when my dog's been a bit whiffy. Sold as deodorising sprays. Just put your hand over their face and a few squirts.
Also, my dog wears bandanas that I wash constantly and dot with a tiny bit of lavender essential oil.
1061 2018-10-22 21:49:15 I go back an forth between there and great Canadian oil change...

1066 2018-10-22 21:48:37 Years ago, when the price of oil was $ 100, they made the national budget as if it cost 40 dollars, the rest was stolen.
1067 2018-10-22 21:48:23 Dear senator,why not get off the oil addiction in our country do research of natural alternatives!!
1068 2018-10-22 21:47:48 you have oil?

1070 2018-10-22 21:47:38 Why don't you cut aide off to Saudi Arabia. Making the U S. look weak and a sell out to oil. Also selling weapons to Saudi Arabia and then they bomb Ethiopians and Somalians.
1071 2018-10-22 21:47:21 It depends! For the most part, everything seems to be lower in fat (beans, rice, veggies) to the point where I make an effort to add good fat (olive oil, avos, nuts) to my diet bc fat is necessary for your body. But the baked goods are probably the same fat content as nonvegan!

1074 2018-10-22 21:47:12 We also need to stop all oil imports from the Saudi’s as well and start to use our own natural resources rather than funding them.

But if you guys would rather oil up instead of talk politics, that's cool too.

1085 2018-10-22 21:45:45 And skipped 22 oil changes in a row.

1088 2018-10-22 21:45:23 I don't know if we produce it but we definitely have it lol. 

I didn't even know olive oil was supposed to be nearly a sauce it's so flavourful. In Portugal I would put it on plain rice and it was glorious just like that

Oh and NO FUCKING BODY makes better cheddar no way

1098 2018-10-22 21:44:18 What say you @orangutans...is RSPO palm oil as harmless as we are led to believe? Or does it still harm because it keeps palm oil as a common ingredient viable?  Serious question.
1099 2018-10-22 21:44:12 English Olive oil? WTF.
1100 2018-10-22 21:43:54 I think using baby oil + stationary shop glitter is better cuz the glitter is gonna float around in the thick liquid 
1101 2018-10-22 21:43:53 it's not oil until it's processed out of the tar.
1102 2018-10-22 21:43:50 It's all whistling past the graveyard at this point. We may have hit peak oil but we're now well past peak consumption. The only thing keeping the industry alive at this point is artificially cheap gas. It's only delaying the inevitable.
1103 2018-10-22 21:43:45 That's where all our oil is.

Not all oils are linoleic acid. You've been low carbing for years, you should've known this.
1116 2018-10-22 21:42:32 Well said. We don't need the Saudi's nor their oil. This isn't the 1970s when the terrorist regime of Saudi imposed an oil embargo on the US. The US no longer depends on SA oil. Plus 15 of the September 11th hijackers were from SA, is reason enough to isolate this regime for good

1121 2018-10-22 21:41:22 I like making baby red potatoes with Rosemary, some oil, and salt to taste and bake them in the oven.  Taste so good, but so simple.
1122 2018-10-22 21:41:05 While this is somewhat admirable, it really isn't enough. Palm oil needs to go out of favor, and then out of business.
1123 2018-10-22 21:40:46 A Liberal connected business is getting a commission on that oil.

It's always the case when Liberals don't act in the national interest.
1124 2018-10-22 21:40:33 Fuck Saudi Arabia and their damn oil. The families of Saudi  government officials got on planes and flew out of here under Bush protection when word broke that all but 1 9/11 hijacker was from Saudi Arabia. They owned Bush, now they own Trump. The GOP is sickening. Murderers!

1128 2018-10-22 21:40:21 As long as oil is priced in US dollars -it’s called the petro dollar- rises on the price of oil do not hurt the US, -all the contrary-, but the end of the petrodollar surely will. Are you sure you want to punish the snake that keeps the rats at bay for you for being a snake ?
1129 2018-10-22 21:40:16 Lol! No.
The Saudis ship brent crude. All the thinned out tar in the country isn't going to change that or displace their market share.
Build some upgrading capacity before u start talking that 'ethical oil' bs. For all intents and purposes, it isn't even oil.

1223 2018-10-22 21:29:32 just to give some help to the Saudis, Do Hacking involve the use of oil? otherwise nevermind,
1224 2018-10-22 21:29:31 If it was only that simple. Whether you like it or not oil drives western economies which means jobs. @UKLabour are meant to be the party of jobs and a destabilised Saudi Arabia will mean job losses in the West. I understand the morale dilemma but at what cost to your voters?
1225 2018-10-22 21:29:30 I used to have REALLY oily skin, even on the scalp of my hair but within the past year, my skin and my scalp dry asl and tea tree oil not helping good enough  how do I remedy this?!
1226 2018-10-22 21:29:29 How much for rso oil
1227 2018-10-22 21:28:59 Gimme a napkin, gimme a linen,

1228 2018-10-22 21:28:56 And adding peppermint oil to my shampoo. 
1229 2018-10-22 21:28:56 "And what do you do?
- Drilling, mostly.
- Oh, oil?
- No, props."
1230 2018-10-22 21:28:53 Randy as a self proclaimed champion of Canadian energy workers, does it bother you that we are buying oil from a country that kills school children, journalists, gay people and stones women to death for being raped? Why are you not calling for an end to buying Saudi oil?
1231 2018-10-22 21:28:48 Make sure you don’t use anything with oil on your face - cleansers, moisturizers, makeup remover - they use oil to take the lashes off!!! Learned this the hard way 
1232 2018-10-22 21:28:41 She sighs, taking the toy out. She then gets a first aid kit and patches him up, applying a special oil to help heal the injuries. She keeps the cage on, though. That was the contract after all
1233 2018-10-22 21:28:38 Canada should freeze import of Saudi blood oil and export ethically produced Canadian oil to the world  @JustinTrudeau @jjhorgan @RachelNotley #Gateway #Energyeast
1234 2018-10-22 21:28:36 It’s a special kind of stupid that we have one of the largest oil reserves on the planet but still import oil by tanker because the environmental experts don’t want a pipeline .
1235 2018-10-22 21:28:32 I sure do! Some of my favs: @SheaMoisture Jamaican black castor oil shampoo, @carolsdaughter cactus rose water shampoo and conditioner *does have a rose smell* @DevaCurl no poo and one condition decadence. @CURLShaircare blueberry wash
1236 2018-10-22 21:28:27 Buy our oil and gas????Jr,why are the american people getting fucked at the g damn pump?our government proudly proclaims “USA is now the largest oil producer in the world!”BUT our per gallon cost is still tied to opec’s per barrel cost?????WHY?? WHY are we exporting our oil??
1237 2018-10-22 21:28:19 Just try and keep your hair nourished with oil
1238 2018-10-22 21:28:08 In Oil City, Titusville and Sharon boys soccer are scoreless as we head to overtime in the 2A first round playoff game.
1239 2018-10-22 21:28:00 like the Oil you buy , they take American money, then send it back to the us through Political contribution, Then you take that money build $78m equipment and sell it to them for 1/4 price , So that they can use those weapons to kill American Souls , That kind of MATH
1240 2018-10-22 21:27:49 I don't need oil I ride the bus.
1241 2018-10-22 21:27:41 I am gonna have so much art of this beautiful girl and her name will be Myrrh like the scented oil and I will cherish her forever 
1242 2018-10-22 21:27:33 A good - no, excellent - soffritto takes over 2 hours to cook. Olive oil, carrots and celery cooked slowly for maybe an hour. Add tin tomato, whack in more oil, salt. Cook slowly. When mouth is watering at the smell, it's probably ready. #worldutterlyvilebutfoodislife
1243 2018-10-22 21:27:13 "You're going to find everything." Limitless matter and energy? No wonder he wants them stopped, a threat to his Big Oil donors. #sarcasm #TrumpIsAMoron
1244 2018-10-22 21:27:12 I wore rue 21 black for like 3 years straight. What was it? Curve cool water? I had the spray bottle, the oil, and the samples of that shit. 
1245 2018-10-22 21:27:10 The murder appears to be an inside Coup against Prince MBS - best to hold tight and wait for evidence to come forward - taking down the petrodollar and 150 dollars a barrel for oil is not a good solution.
1246 2018-10-22 21:27:03 The only thing that kept Obama's economy out of the gutter was FRACKING technology. Something he and his Eco-Marxist colleagues have fiercely opposed. Fracking brought oil prices back down to earth, and the economy slowly improved despite Obama's incompetence,
1247 2018-10-22 21:26:29 At least until they decide to use them on us....we were getting better with less oil imports and now w/Trump/R's back to oil Again with ZERO focus on Clean energy .
1248 2018-10-22 21:26:21 God, why didn't this man just come in when we had money? Why didn't You just allow him win when the oil boom was to happen?

I see him surpassing Joseph in the bible with savings & feeding his people with infrastructures.

Whao, 16yrs of waste under PDP never to be gotten back.
1249 2018-10-22 21:26:17 Really- you’re rather transparent... “Give us your despots, your gold and oil...”

1255 2018-10-22 21:25:09 America supported Kuwait which is not practicing democracy and you can see the romance with Saudi Arabia. America only fights country that jeopardizes their interest saddam hussein was attacked because of oil in Kuwait. Saudia arabia can do anyhow because of their oil. So 
1256 2018-10-22 21:25:04 FFS Boulton has gone and mentioned the ‘R’ word!  Right that’s it, I’m off to make haste and put my boiling oil on the bubble!
1257 2018-10-22 21:24:54 i wonder if the theory is that it toughens the skins :) my favorite black eyed pea dish is with palm oil, tomatoes, onions, and smoked fish... serve with plantains
1258 2018-10-22 21:24:49 "Look what you made me do!"
1259 2018-10-22 21:24:29 What you could also do is get a plain bottle of CBD oil and a bottle of THC oil and then mix and match according to time of day/what you need to get done. CBD is more for morning and THC more for night.
1260 2018-10-22 21:24:28 I’ve seen that training for oil rig workers as well. Pretty #BadAss
1261 2018-10-22 21:24:17 Gonna be an adult and get my oil changed tomorrow gonna be a double adult and check my oil tonight 
watch out world
1262 2018-10-22 21:24:16 @JustinTrudeau if you had the spine your father had. Biafra? Youd tell the Saudis to bugger themselves. Cut off all oil imports. Enact legislation to build Energy East. Throw out all Saudi Students and say bugger to the Arms deal. Canadians would support u. Stand up.
1263 2018-10-22 21:24:09 1) I did not mention the Stones
2) Comparing the development of land to profits of an oil/gas drilling company is much different. 
3) we are debating what is best for the City not a corporation and McGrory has been VERY BAD FOR THE CITY!
1264 2018-10-22 21:23:57 I told Siri to text my dad “what kind of oil should I get again” but it sent “what kind of oil should I get a gun” which prompted a very fun call from my dad immediately
1265 2018-10-22 21:23:56 The problem with Alberta oil is its too expensive. Too hard to extract, too hard to ship to the point that they're almost paying people to take it. And the glut of oil on the market is probably not ever going away as more and more nations and people turn to renewables.
1266 2018-10-22 21:23:56 The same way you bombing Iraq for nothing at least my government involved in Yemen wars because the official Yemen government asked the Saudi government to help them. Not for oil and gold.
1267 2018-10-22 21:23:48 And yet he opposes pipelines that would allow eastern Canada and world markets buy ethical CDN oil rather than oil from SA. Oil is what is funding SA’s atrocities and by buying it CDN’s are condoning their actions.
1268 2018-10-22 21:23:45 And it was Nixon who signed the Clean Air Act. Republicans only went rogue recently, for oil and coal money.
1269 2018-10-22 21:23:39 ..A year or two back I think I saw a NYFed oil price model that actually used some fancy auto regression econometrics in their price forecast (aka total statistical garbage with nothing to do with actual economy)
1270 2018-10-22 21:23:38 Yes they definitely have it in Cali. Just asked for a balanced 1:1 CBD:THC oil. This means it has equal amounts of THC (makes you high) and CBD (doesn't). The CBD makes you more functional and awesome for that autistic noise in my brain.
1271 2018-10-22 21:23:30 Member of U.S.-led coalition killed in Afghanistan in apparent insider attack: DA AFGHANS DON'T TAKE TOO KINDLY TO OUR REPUBLICUNT FINANCIAL & "OIL" CORP "KOCH"-SUKKAS TRYIN' TO TAKE OVER THEIR COUNTRY AND THEIR OIL !!!
1272 2018-10-22 21:23:28 Trump response to #ClimateChange is to ignore science & give tax-breaks to oil & coal. Trump-GOP policy is... Increase carbon-emissions & Screw-the-Future (ie the Youth's future). This Anti-future No-science Gov (Pro-Oil) = Future pollution & Debt for Youth. Need #ClimateAction
1273 2018-10-22 21:23:12 One day I will bring my car in for an oil change and there will be nothing else wrong with it.
But that day is not today, and now today sucks.
1274 2018-10-22 21:23:04 Corbyn already had Geologist Big Oil Shill up in his mentions about fracking. The oil and gas lobby will actively promote anti-science for 
1275 2018-10-22 21:23:00 "hi yes ill take one basic bitch oil change." lolol
1276 2018-10-22 21:23:00 寝るか
1277 2018-10-22 21:23:00 Anyway, j'voulais pas le tweeter pour pas attirer le mauvais œil mais c'est la période du mois et j'ai pas de bouton, jojoba oil is really that girl. Si je me réveille demain matin avec des boutons je l'aurais bien cherché.
1278 2018-10-22 21:22:57 Unless the car crashes into a river of molten oil, rolls out into a vat of acid, then into subzero mad sci-fi cooling liquid - and then they burst into flames, just for the craic. I disagree
1279 2018-10-22 21:22:38 Peak Oil, is here and past, we are on the down slope of production, Empires on Oil are dying and We are said empire.  China though Is not, It is feeding off our dying days, and we as a husk of a nation, will slip screaming nukes at people, into the night.
1280 2018-10-22 21:22:34 Benjamin Adekunle d killer of Biafra Christians is a Christian from Anglican so as Gowon d genocide, Obasanjo d massacre of Odi community,TY danjuma only but few yet they kill fellow Christians who weren't part of coup or govt for UK to steal oil. What type of Christians is that?
1281 2018-10-22 21:22:26 Olbus Oil!!
1282 2018-10-22 21:22:25 ICE vehicles benefit from externalities which is a form of indirect subsidy. Cost of global warming, oil wars, providing military protection for oil rich countries and health care for masses that are poisoned by pollution. If these were paid by big oil&auto, they wouldn’t exist.
1283 2018-10-22 21:22:25 Go 2 hr and see who gives up first.
1284 2018-10-22 21:22:24 Oil and water mix on the surface to give a rainbow effect.
1285 2018-10-22 21:22:13 Week 2 of being home....I went to the gym came home ran myself tired took a nap. Got up ran some errands. Gassed up. Picked my sister up from school. Now I'm back home cleaning. Going through the pantry and moved our oil diffuser to the kitchen, home smelling like teatree 
1286 2018-10-22 21:22:03 I put peppermint oil in my diffuser and my life has never been better
1287 2018-10-22 21:22:00 The Irishman opposing Cruz who wants to add a $10.00 tax to every barrel of oil, increase regulations, and repeal the tax reform.. you know, opposite the platform that has allowed Texas to flourish economically 
1288 2018-10-22 21:21:54 I missed the tweet about supporting Saudi Arabian oil companies that actually fund terrorism. Why are you not screaming to boycott Saudi Arabian oil? They fund terrorism. Why does this not offend you
1289 2018-10-22 21:21:43 That's just sad. I never tried black-eyed peas with meat, but I'm fond of the way we have them in Greece, with spinach, olive oil and a fuckton of herbs.
1290 2018-10-22 21:21:28 Did the phrase “you’re going down like Liberace on an oil rig “ get mentioned at any point ?
1291 2018-10-22 21:21:25 CBD oil doesn't get you high, I assume that person isn't aware of that.
1292 2018-10-22 21:21:14 Apple cider vinegar and coconut oil both have like 4 million uses each
1293 2018-10-22 21:21:00 Finally getting an oil change after 67k miles 
1294 2018-10-22 21:21:00 two points away from your oil slicked club
1295 2018-10-22 21:20:43 Lol all you do is go in and say I need an oil change 
1296 2018-10-22 21:20:36 TY Chi. I find it odd that the NY Fed w/all their PHDs on staff go off & build an oil price model full of random financial variables. It's not that hard to do actual fundamental analysis, & I would suspect important for the fed to have a view on, I don't know, prices & inflation?
1297 2018-10-22 21:20:23 now the wheels fall of the bus #OOTT #snp #energy #oil #china #usa #stocks #dtw #uso #europe but you have to decide for yourself
1298 2018-10-22 21:20:15 Step 1 of my #Offical2nd “oil change” was quick.. I broke the plug bolt easily when my #ryobi 18v couldn’t do it.. that bih started smoking lol
1299 2018-10-22 21:20:14 this selfie is so good its like an oil painting of a home alone (the movie!) still ? magic
1300 2018-10-22 21:19:58 Yes. Balance Larry. Nova Scotia receives about $3 billion per yr in transfers which are largely from oil royalties
1301 2018-10-22 21:19:54 I showed how they lied in 1970s and hid the true oil figures I showed that Whisky was the 3rd most export in the UK and is underpriced and a tax could be put on this as order books are sold out for year in advance so as not to depend on oil. But you had no faith in yourselves.
1302 2018-10-22 21:19:42 My oil change ran so long that I was gonna be late to class so instead I got a latte and skipped
1303 2018-10-22 21:19:34 Change or die! Home solar+batteries says it all... the PEOPLE are doing way more than the wacked out oil+coal soaked politicians and utilities
1304 2018-10-22 21:19:32 @elonmusk To fight hurricane Willa, pour vegetable oil on H2O in its path.  See "Crazy Lake Experiment" on YouTube.  Oil deploys to a monolayer, diminishes evaporation, the storm's fuel for less storm surge, lower winds.  Worked on Irma, Florence, Matthew.
1305 2018-10-22 21:19:31 Imagine this country (Iraq) is one of the world's largest oil exporter. It's worst than Liberia or Haiti. Instead of giving their oil for free to their Ayatollahs masters, they should fix their miserable country
1306 2018-10-22 21:19:11 Bro you just get the book?
1307 2018-10-22 21:19:10 Ok I should do this now then.

1312 2018-10-22 21:18:54 If you are the champion of the energy sector you claim to be, why are you not demanding Ottawa cease all purchases of Saudi oil? Besides being the moral thing to do, it's also the smartest move for Canadian oil workers.
1313 2018-10-22 21:18:50 Barry & facts = oil & water
1314 2018-10-22 21:18:47 Mr president you will create million of jobs in southern hemisphere; than Iran will have to export more oil !so will Iraq ;and others creating stability in middle east! it is a good move!
1315 2018-10-22 21:18:47 I am not sure why the msm doesn’t address the fact we buy Saudi oil which in turn funds a gov that commits these atrocities?
1316 2018-10-22 21:18:41 That is a lot of oil
1317 2018-10-22 21:18:40 Oil goes up than everything gets costly and productivity goes down, check out the comparisons during each crash of the stock markets, I’m all for pipelines if it helps create solar,wind and geothermal, imagine owning your own power supply......
1318 2018-10-22 21:18:37 Any number of NGOs with a Globalist view of a world without borders.
1319 2018-10-22 21:18:35 I guess I have some principles I won't bend on. There is nothing "progressive" about slashing royalties on our resources, lying to us, attacking our fellow Canadians and then pushing ill advised expansion of dirty energy to make foreign oil compasses wealthy.
1320 2018-10-22 21:18:31 Costly Western Canad select is 28$. WTI is 69$. The last two refiners in Washington without Coker's for WCS are doing cost evaluation. The spur off TransMountain to Washington could take all the oil.Rail going to St John is still discounted to WTI by almost 20$/ barrel
1321 2018-10-22 21:18:28 Change or die! Home solar+batteries says it all... the PEOPLE are doing way more than the wacked out oil+coal soaked politicians and utilities
1322 2018-10-22 21:18:24 And it cost $20b, which is Nigeria’s 2 years crude oil earnings. Fellow compatriots Nigeria is broke!!!
1323 2018-10-22 21:18:20 It's great when your own birthday party turns into a boulder with a very big idiot. Because I will say some of my fridge and held me at gun point, asking where the oil
1324 2018-10-22 21:18:15 Because they don’t have oil. .. it’s the oil sanctions imposed on Venezuela that scuppered them .. after all .. he USA can’t have an actual successful socialist government working properly can they ......
1325 2018-10-22 21:18:12 What an idiot, because England doesn’t have food , water, electricity, oil etc, because it’s still a 3rd world country 
1326 2018-10-22 21:18:09 Handisati sha. But check ku Pick n' Pay iri ku MegaWatt mall. I'm sure unogona kumawana...Heard vari kuti buy groceries worth $15 then you can purchase the cooking oil.
1327 2018-10-22 21:18:02 1st time I read ab 15Y  Commod Super Cycle.
My take is 30Years Super Cycle 10up 20down (sideways+rebounds) $CRB Index #Oil + $gld
1328 2018-10-22 21:18:02 We are the largest oil producing nation in the world, we don’t need their oil to carry on for many hundreds of years.  Plenty of time for our engineers, inventors and scientist to harness the sun & wind.
1329 2018-10-22 21:17:48 Complete bollocks. Demand expectations? Aren't they aware the forward oil price curve is based not on producer/consumer price expectations, but rather producer/consumer price FEARS (albeit investors who fear inflation & producers manipulating prices muddy the water) #OOTT
1330 2018-10-22 21:17:47 Should stop importing $1.5 billion annually of Saudi oil, and use Canadian resources instead
1331 2018-10-22 21:17:40 I think the views of every American is compromised since Americans buy Middle Eastern oil  what a stupid logic even though I don’t agree with some of your Middle Eastern views
1332 2018-10-22 21:17:32 And WTI won't average $70. US inventories won't be below 350mb, US production didn't disappoint, KSA and others had spare capacity and we are still awash with oil. The guy had nearly everything but price wrong. Even a broken clock is correct twice a day.
1333 2018-10-22 21:17:31 We buy billions of dollars worth of Saudi Oil, if you sanction them, you better get energy East in the ground first.
1334 2018-10-22 21:17:28 Theirs is better  imagine Kasu Vs kadpoly like really  who looks at hnd now
1335 2018-10-22 21:17:16 Weren't you offered any other procedure. I've had women in Cysters having different procedures and also having sucess with castor oil packs if u want some info x

1337 2018-10-22 21:17:10 Have you spoken out about Canada buying Saudi oil? I have yet to see a single tweet or fb post. Please correct me if I am wrong. But do you think Canada should be buying its oil from a country that just murdered a bus full of school children, or murdered a journalist

1348 2018-10-22 21:15:31 All you can talk about is why we can’t give up on gas/oil/coal. I say we can.  We can leave the CO2 in the ground.  We can create lots of new jobs around the renewable technologies. We gave up on coal in ON. Why can’t AB?
1349 2018-10-22 21:15:28 School wasn’t to bad got picked on a little but that’s my everyday school life....but I got copy of study days which is great. Plus on Wednesday I get to face time my daddy from the oil rig can’t wait. But the thing I am excited about today is watching jimmy fallon tonight 
1350 2018-10-22 21:15:26 a gold plated, oil filled cake as emergency room visit cost a helluva lot more than a simple cake, Proper insurance would cut those costs dramatically.
1351 2018-10-22 21:15:13 Indeed. But the squeeky wheel gets the oil. Keep the fire burning!
1352 2018-10-22 21:15:07 Lol their call was for WTI to average $70 in 2018, made back when oil was $52/bbl. Go back to bed
1353 2018-10-22 21:15:07 Wait until we start restrictions on oil by rail.
1354 2018-10-22 21:15:04 @CTV_PowerPlay  We should not be selling Saudi armoured vehicles  and we should not be buying Saudi oil!!! Worried about Ontario jobs why not Alberta and Saskatchewan jobs?!!
1355 2018-10-22 21:14:57 What about vegan cheese made from coconut oil? Or is that hydrogenated?
1356 2018-10-22 21:14:47 Lord today... my oil light tried to flash on this morning. I don’t need a $100 oil change rn.. 
1357 2018-10-22 21:14:45 So do you prefer your middle easterners with oil and bone saws?
1358 2018-10-22 21:14:42 @traybills 2018 ALMOST UP LETS ACKNOWLEDGE THE WORDS TRAY GAVE US.. yup Mhmm. Your canceled.. Yadigg.. Tuh.. Yes sirrr.. The bills way.. Call me Mr Bills i do this forreal.. Mr place that baby oil. .the Airbender
1359 2018-10-22 21:14:35 Pulling out of the arms deal and ratcheting up tensions increases the price of oil, which is Putin's biggest objective.  Same reason Trump is pulling out of Iran Deal and Paris Accord.  The American oil boom completely blindsided Putin and he's been in desperation mode since.
1360 2018-10-22 21:14:19 @lopezobrador_ Fight hurricane Willa by pouring vegetable oil where the hurricane is expected to go.  1000 gallons will diminish it to a cat 3.  10,000 gallons to a cat 2. 100,000 gallons to a cat 1, and about 1000000 gallons to utterly destroy Willa.
1361 2018-10-22 21:14:14 Burning the procrastinating oil. BURNED. Off for my power nap 
1362 2018-10-22 21:14:10 They are rich because the western world helped them to find gas and oil...
They were simply lucky to get these natrual resouces that they use to fund radical Muslim and buy slaves and women
1363 2018-10-22 21:14:03 They told me that too lol and my dad was like no i literally just put a new battery in i hate oil change people 
1364 2018-10-22 21:14:03 Making cheese oil because I have no life
1365 2018-10-22 21:13:59 Neither is Nigella sativa oil, it's just expensive
1366 2018-10-22 21:13:54 I just wanna know why my skin thinks it's okay to produce oil at the rate it does
1367 2018-10-22 21:13:46 Oil though, will continue to flow.  That way, Liberals can now harm two different sectors of Canadian workers.
1368 2018-10-22 21:13:45 @qikipedia That's the great thing about whales: you don't have to wait millions of years for them to decay under specific conditions to get oil from them. #qi
1369 2018-10-22 21:13:41 Seriously insulted! Getting fed up of bankrolling rUK and being sat on like this...another oil discovery going straight down the road to the Bank of England! #DissolveTheUnion #Indyref2 #Brexit #BrexitShambles
1370 2018-10-22 21:13:33 Because people are stupid and they follow the snake oil salesmen.
1371 2018-10-22 21:13:18 massage coconut oil on your scalp and leave it in as a treatment, then wash, 1-2x a week! i grew my hair to hip length doing this
1372 2018-10-22 21:13:04 Carol Gill Rudolph-Chrystal asks:

One question: What the hell is the difference between Saudi's and Iranians?
Answer: 
NOTHING. We do not need Saudi's Oil thanks to OBAMA!

And says:  Vote TRUE BLUE!!!
1373 2018-10-22 21:12:58 Depressed
1374 2018-10-22 21:12:58 There's also natural gas! Although, in the interest of fairness, the prior homeowners converted our house to it from oil. =)
1375 2018-10-22 21:12:35 Notorious
1376 2018-10-22 21:12:22 There were so many fake Left people at Standing Rock who were infiltrators, mercenaries, agent provoveteurs, & informants. They helped out the local police, the oil company, the FBI & i think the CIA too.
1377 2018-10-22 21:12:20 Saudi's are bullies. They have been for a while. It is because of their oil! Why not let them sell the oil in their own country and see how it goes. At some point, we must tell them enough is enough.
1378 2018-10-22 21:12:10 When asked about oil imports from Saudi Arabia, @RachelNotley says that country and others don't meet the standard that should be required and Canadian oil should be the priority.
1379 2018-10-22 21:12:08 Mr president the world got out of recession with low energy prices ;and low interest rates ;if you control oil market using second largest reserves ;than you can control economic cycles for many decades!
1380 2018-10-22 21:12:07 Dipshit aging tech reviewer @THErealDVORAK and moronic washed up MTV veejay @adamcurry are disgusting fascist snake oil peddlers, broadcasting lies and white supremacist tropes to their audience of reactionary middle class brown shirts.
1381 2018-10-22 21:12:05 There are scientific studies that prove oil of Oregano works as strong as morphine for pain without the harmful side effects and has been proven to be anti-cancer even though your doc may never of heard of it, it can also be taken to reduce the harmful effects of chemo!
1382 2018-10-22 21:11:55 I think I wanna make an oil painting of tae but... does bighit allow large envelopes for fan mail?
1383 2018-10-22 21:11:48 Omg I have thus shampoo with avocado oil in it and it’s so fucking good let me tell you. Also I use Syoss (the gold one) a lot those are really good. (I never thought I would talk about shampoo with people lmao I feel like a beauty product person) 
1384 2018-10-22 21:11:47 Can't wait for the pics of his wife dressed head to toe in a Burka and mini-skirt waving gold coins dipped in blood and oil...
1385 2018-10-22 21:11:47 Meet with oil company and getting votes 
1386 2018-10-22 21:11:35 Wheat and cars are actually valuable.  Tar sands oil is dirty, uses 1/3 of Canada's precious natural gas and needs billions in subsidies, taxpayer funded buyouts of pipelines.
1387 2018-10-22 21:11:30 Stop propping up the PM as some tough leader he should stop Saudi Oil from coming to Canada
1388 2018-10-22 21:11:24 Working in an antiquated industry (oil company), it is interesting to see the push and pull between IT, and those whom have worked a fair share in the industry. Both trying to find a balance between modernizing our ways, and staying on the same path.
1389 2018-10-22 21:11:17 020.quantity「量」
in sufficient quantity「十分な分量の」
a large/small quantity of oil「大量/少量の油」
1390 2018-10-22 21:11:10 So, will the oil co. Have to pay a penalty for each gallon and every day the have left this leak to continue to spill oil into the gulf?
1391 2018-10-22 21:11:06 I can’t go in Marshall’s and not buy coconut oil 
1392 2018-10-22 21:10:59 Oh the joys of getting an oil change
1393 2018-10-22 21:10:56 Adults have lost the right to lead.  How about planting hemp seeds in all fields now, CO2 trap and replace plastics.  Build battery factories in all cities to get us off oil.
1394 2018-10-22 21:10:55 And this is from an administration that tariffs Canada, and has pissed off all our NATO allies. But Arabs who have oil??? They can murder American residents. #SMH
1395 2018-10-22 21:10:55 there's a site involving gas and oil for vehicles
called fuel freedom.
1396 2018-10-22 21:10:49 Have you tried peppermint oil?  Helps with my migraines.
1397 2018-10-22 21:10:47 Oil futures dropped a buck a barrel. Both Brent and WTI.
1398 2018-10-22 21:10:45 @cafreeland @JustinTrudeau #Canada must be a leader and cancel ALL contracts – sales of #weapons and purchases of #oil –to and from the murderous #SaudiArabia !! That kingdom’s behaviour is anathema to our values! Or are some hidden financial interests preventing you from acting?

1402 2018-10-22 21:10:03 サラダ油に流されて変わってゆく私をあなたは時々遠くで叱って。
1403 2018-10-22 21:10:03 To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it
1404 2018-10-22 21:09:49 But Merkal is responsible for keeping Europe enslaved to millions barrels Russian gas & oil
1405 2018-10-22 21:09:47 Lol today at the gym my phone fell in the stair master and dude had to take the machine half way apart to find it and once he found it he reached in and got oil all over his arms  sorry I’m clumsy 
1406 2018-10-22 21:09:39 My friends cancer was soo bad the VA refused to give him anymore treatment and basically sent him to the streets to die, I gave him a camper on land I owned and a couple bottles of the oil of oregano to help ease his pain as he had no money, he miraculously made a full recovery!
1407 2018-10-22 21:09:32 Need to schedule it in on my calendar. 8 am -midnight “Alexa time” Buy bottle of baby oil.
1408 2018-10-22 21:09:25 There’s a PhD thesis to be written somewhere on just how successfully implanted the idea of “ethical oil” has become in Alberta politics. Practically everyone, on all sides, makes the case.
1409 2018-10-22 21:09:17 I just saw this (thanks @TBPInvictus)   this is a pretty crude model (pardon the pun) ...this was done by bankers, not oil analysts so take it with a grain of salt. what they have right is that supply has now flipped so we are at a marginal surplus to demand
1410 2018-10-22 21:09:14 Laaa harda etc
1411 2018-10-22 21:09:08 Don't buy , consume or sell ANYTHING from them let us see if they can survive on their own with their oil, it is high time the people in that country respected human rights issues!!
1412 2018-10-22 21:08:52 "We should not be importing oil from a range of countries that are uninterested in human rights, uninterested in combatting climate change." Premier Rachel Notley said. She calls Alberta one of the most socially and environmentally progressive oil producers in the world.
1413 2018-10-22 21:08:49 When all my pals were playing with their dollies i was always the visiting aunt - and my husband was always either in the army or working on the oil rigs 
1414 2018-10-22 21:08:40 Calling this mob of invaders a caravan of immigrants is like saying the BP oil spill into the golf of Mexico was a leak !!!!
1415 2018-10-22 21:08:27 They’re ruling the friggin world with lucrative arms deals and oil!
1416 2018-10-22 21:08:17 Im happy for Wenger. Mans amassed over £100,000,000M while at Arsenal. My $$ buying club merchandise contributed to that. Should I also suckle his teets & anoint his feet with oil from my alabaster box?
1417 2018-10-22 21:08:09 And yet the greens enable the saudis by opposing CDN oil and thereby allowing them to continue to ship us their oil.
1418 2018-10-22 21:08:08 Allah ya raya bby
1419 2018-10-22 21:08:07 The federal government has a role to play in increasing capacity says @RachelNotley in her pitch to have the federal government to buy cars and locomotives to move oil in the absence of new pipelines.
1420 2018-10-22 21:08:01 There's aren't just Jared's buddies I seem to remember 911 and the Saudi connection. Why have they {who are living still in time of the Crusades} been given a Free pass every freaking time. OH yeah oil &  . Bullshit they should be on the list of terrorists countries. thanks
1421 2018-10-22 21:08:00 Lastly, spray some air freshener, spray perfume, drop some essential oil, or light up candles  to make your room smell  A M A Z I N G !
1422 2018-10-22 21:07:52 She wants the federal government to help pay to increase the capacity of the rail cars. She's outlining strategies for the business case of oil and gas on rails. She says it will be less expensive than the $1.1B write-off for Chrysler.
1423 2018-10-22 21:07:50 Three capital sins. They exist. They have oil. They don’t take orders from DC.
1424 2018-10-22 21:07:45 Kache za a yi clearing dinsu, I mostly see it in girls phone
1425 2018-10-22 21:07:38 And of course, Qatar never had a car industry
They can only buy ones with oil/gas based money.
That's it...
1426 2018-10-22 21:07:29 I wanna play more AL but im out of oil
1427 2018-10-22 21:07:04 My culture is not your oil change!!!
1428 2018-10-22 21:07:03 dear east coast: your whole heating oil nonsense sucks
1429 2018-10-22 21:06:55 @POTUS @WhiteHouse @Senate @Congress BP's 14 Year Gulf Of Mexico Oil Leak! The Dead Zone Keeps Getting Larger!
1430 2018-10-22 21:06:55 Citronella spray, oil, and candles repel them very effectively. Lavender works too.
1431 2018-10-22 21:06:53 Notley says pipelines are safest way to move oil but due to lack of fed CPC/Lib ability to build pipelines, more oil by rail is only alternative for Alberta.
1432 2018-10-22 21:06:44 #Welcome_to_Davos_Desert An important meeting that would pave the way for a period of time without dependence on oil
1433 2018-10-22 21:06:44 THEY HAVE OIL!
1434 2018-10-22 21:06:42 I'm Pedro Romano from united state and I'm a businessman,i deal on buying and selling of gold and crude oil ,but am currently in high sea now for business trip and you?
1435 2018-10-22 21:06:37 You're safe
1436 2018-10-22 21:06:31 my mom and i really just waited for well over an hour JUST to get the oil in her car changed
1437 2018-10-22 21:06:26 I absolutely agree. Wish I'd thought of this before, but I will no longer buy my favorite olive oil imported from Spain. I'll be on the lookout for other Spanish imports & will spread the word. Spain should feel SHAME for allowing this activity. All people are accountable to God.
1438 2018-10-22 21:06:22 Will you send me the link? I've only tried seeds and oil

1443 2018-10-22 21:05:16 I found black canvas. 
I can’t wait to use this white oil paint on it.
1444 2018-10-22 21:05:14 I realized what makes houses smell like crap, vegetable oil, especially when it absorbs into fabric.  So, thank whomever insists on cooking with said oil.
1445 2018-10-22 21:05:08 I’ve been asking this question for YEARS. Snake oil? 
1446 2018-10-22 21:05:03 there is oil paint on my bedsheets, but i didn’t even touch my oils today :))
1447 2018-10-22 21:05:03 Oil field trash once again 
1448 2018-10-22 21:05:02 BTW, Israel is too small to ride sports cars
You will be using first-second gear shift all day long
As for Qatar, you need to kiss the shoes of the western countries who found the oil and gas for you.
Because if they didn't, you would ride only camels and donkeys 
1449 2018-10-22 21:05:01 You missed the part where I work in the oil business. I believe that is “skin in the game”
1450 2018-10-22 21:04:53 The ones that DON’T have palm oil! Stop carrying products with palm oil!
1451 2018-10-22 21:04:46 Lavender oil is steam-distilled from the flowers of the lavender plant. The unique mosaic of naturally occurring phytochemicals includes linalool and linalyl acetate, considered to be its main active constituents. @newrootsherbal
1452 2018-10-22 21:04:40 Ive had good experiences w the oil but the pills for some reason seem to be working better. Theyre from egypt.

1455 2018-10-22 21:04:22 What Saudi Arabia needs is total blackout from the world at large ..so what if they have oil...screw them!!!
1456 2018-10-22 21:04:20 All I want for my birthday is 4 new tires and an oil change.
1457 2018-10-22 21:04:13 Maybe if Honduras had giant oil reserves.....or owned a large part of the US debt....or bought lots of weapons....or stayed in Trump hotels....or bought Trump properties at massively inflated prices.... Or....
1458 2018-10-22 21:03:49 Would you use the same chili crisp recipe or modify it in any way? tbh, even just chili oil on ice cream would be great
1459 2018-10-22 21:03:41 motor oil isn't environmentally friendly, try a poisonous mushroom instead 
1460 2018-10-22 21:03:41 Which one is that?
1461 2018-10-22 21:03:36 I have to get an oil change ASAP
1462 2018-10-22 21:03:28 or maybe they both just need oil
1463 2018-10-22 21:03:27 Doing this hot oil treatment in my hair it feels great.
1464 2018-10-22 21:03:25 I went to go get my oil change, and I asked the guy how much it was this dude tells me “60 but, for you I’ll give it to you for 30” I’m telling you guys pretty privilege is real, I’m out here finessing once again that’s a whole 30 like bro
1465 2018-10-22 21:03:14  Trump falsely claims Germany now buying American natural gas.
<=>Trumpistan 2017: America imports 140,000,000 barrel crude oil from Russia. 2018?
That much about endangering national security by buying from Russia => Trump admin's best Russian boys/ "secretaries"/ employees?

1467 2018-10-22 21:03:05 I didn't study marine engineering to be hunting girls with marine spirit. I can identify oil money though 
1468 2018-10-22 21:03:00 The carbon tax is nothing more then Trudeau forcing Canadians to pay the clean up costs for all the dirty tar sand oil that his big oil buddies sell.
1469 2018-10-22 21:02:57 Snake oil salesmen!
1470 2018-10-22 21:02:54 Did I follow this correctly? We're supposed to destroy the taste of the rice w/coconut oil, *then* let it sit for 12 hours & cook it again? 

I'll say it again, must be nice to be rich & stupid.
1471 2018-10-22 21:02:51 Ugh! Yes! I tried butter, olive oil, peanut oil, lemon juice, hand soap, dish soap, and isopropyl alcohol. Nothing!
1472 2018-10-22 21:02:50 PSEUDO-CHRISTIAN
Does not follow the teachings of Jesus Christ.
Follows the Snake Oil Salesman Doctrine as do all other televangelists.
1473 2018-10-22 21:02:44 @elonmusk Regardless of all the bs you gone through, your one of my biggest inspirations. How about you hedge your Teslatude with some conservative oil well drilling projects we want to partner with you drilling.
1474 2018-10-22 21:02:28 English government?As new oil fields are being discovered,I'm fairly sure they're not "running out" anytime soon. you're one of those who fear a future without Scotland and it's riches and resources aren't you. You're talking like this because you know I'm right,and you're scared
1475 2018-10-22 21:02:21 coconut oil-Coconut oil has emollient properties. Emollients fill the spaces between skin cells, creating a smooth surface. 
petroleum jelly-. It traps moisture underneath. This helps heal dry, irritated skin patches.
1476 2018-10-22 21:02:20 Bro, who doesn’t need oil in the this world. Stop trade with whom?
1477 2018-10-22 21:02:04 Just panicked a little bit because I couldn’t feel my car keys in my pocket, even though I can currently see my car getting an oil change through the waiting room window. Some habits never die.
1478 2018-10-22 21:01:58 You talk like an uneducated person jumping from one point to another.  What makes Azeri oil better than from other places?  People in Khojaly were killed by the hands of Alijev clan to offset Mutalibov.  Lots if proof for that.
1479 2018-10-22 21:01:52 I just missed @mycardoc apparently because I broke my door handle just to visit again. Got me all fixed up in a day so that’s not bad! Also.... check out their pumpkin spiced oil changes- recommended by @justinochoa lmao!
1480 2018-10-22 21:01:36 okay even tho no one is going to see this tweet i have to let this out: i've been fasting for two days now and my bf got back from school and won't stop complaining about how hungry he is and talk about food and i put some coconut oil in my hair which smells rlly yummy -
1481 2018-10-22 21:01:24 I'm glad. We tried mustard, WD-40, olive oil... I forget what else but it was desperate times. I was in tears.
1482 2018-10-22 21:01:20 Big up to my oil paint 
We both drip harder
1483 2018-10-22 21:01:18 5W-30 by the parts counter. I couldn’t find the 0W-40  so I walked up asked them, they asked me my vehicle info then told me I was looking for the wrong oil. When I told them what the book said they still argued :/

1487 2018-10-22 21:01:01 And I'm opposed to my tax dollars being used to subsidize carbon capture and storage to benefit continued oil extraction.  The NDP were also busy cleaning up the devine mess, so there's that. Thanks.
1488 2018-10-22 21:00:54 And that “cooking oil” is much better suited to lubricating machinery than human consumption. Ugh.
1489 2018-10-22 21:00:46 Yes .... we all got oil, and then they got extra to keep them distracted  taking intros very gently until the vets is open 
1490 2018-10-22 21:00:37 The reality is transitioning away from coal would be a massive win. Yes oil/gas isn't better than wind and solar, but there isn't storage capability yet, so they aren't realistic replacements YET.
1491 2018-10-22 21:00:33 That sounds a lot more believable. Sell them our armoured carriers. Get their money then tell them no more. And stop buying any oil from them. Immediately. We don't need that relationship,  get out of any toxic relationships.
1492 2018-10-22 21:00:31 At the Valvoline oil & lube they tell you not to get out of the truck now - felt a bit insulted sitting there in La Burb #pussy wagon edition ... Now you help them check the indicators & answer rude question - same price as before ( ! )

1510 2018-10-22 20:58:59 They will not cross them, because they are in RU's economic best interests. RU is as tired of Syria as is the US. They have largely swapped out KSA for IR, knowing this provides them a bulwark against US FP, and increased GDP. IR will wait out current WH, and know oil $ is king.
1511 2018-10-22 20:58:47 @MichaelAvenatti once told me that he wanted to “dip his bald head in oil and rub it all over my entire body.” I have class. So, allowed him to do it for a quick $15. #metoo #himtoo #MichaelAvenatti
1512 2018-10-22 20:58:41 I’m gonna trim my ends & hot oil treat/deep condition my hair tonight & im already tired from it
1513 2018-10-22 20:58:23 Will that letter be attached to the $220 million cheque we send Saudi Arabia every month for oil purchased in eastern Canada?
1514 2018-10-22 20:58:21 And they will remain poor for a long time to come.

No more freebies as the world gets enlightened.

They benefited from slavery but cannot benefit anymore from the wars for Afghani Opium, Libyan oil, Congolese Coltan or Syrian gas fields coz the executors have ran out of lies..
1515 2018-10-22 20:58:18 Only oil producing nation in the E.U and the English managed to convince you that you could not go it alone and you think you can mock me lol.

1518 2018-10-22 20:57:57 "We need more cars. We need to order more locomotives." Premier Rachel Notley is speaking about the need to use more rail to move oil with the price differential on Alberta oil versus other oil.
She wants to see major changes to Bill C-69.
1519 2018-10-22 20:57:56  didn’t even think about tha oil change
1520 2018-10-22 20:57:55 If only you had been using CBD oil back then mate. Would have cruised to that gold

1523 2018-10-22 20:57:46 Should I try dumping distilled hash oil out of a cartridge into an empty juul pod I was told it works
1524 2018-10-22 20:57:41 It might also be noted that the rising oil prices are just what the Russian budget needs.

1529 2018-10-22 20:57:11 Perks of working at a dealership. I used to get free oil changes
1530 2018-10-22 20:57:05 ATC staff strikes, staff shortages, European unhedged airlines going bust, high crude oil prices.
And Mr O'Leary always blames Brexit.
1531 2018-10-22 20:56:50 Not all at once, it takes time but a country like America can figure it out. But going back to the oil and gas lobbyists, why would they allow it to happen?
1532 2018-10-22 20:56:43 Don, please ask Jagmeet Singh whether we should use Canadian oil rather than Saudi Oil in protest.  Push for honest answer & clear position.
1533 2018-10-22 20:56:42 Even that does not work in a two week time scale. Oil production effects prices at gas pumps in months, not days or weeks.
1534 2018-10-22 20:56:33 Notley says fed govt could buy rail cars and locomotives to help the railways move more oil by rail.
1535 2018-10-22 20:56:28 im so irresponsible i really waited a whole 3 months after the date to get my oil changed
1536 2018-10-22 20:56:22 I’m sure all the oil and gas haters all have their blinders on. Way more convenient for them then that uncomfortable feeling of being hypocritical.

1553 2018-10-22 20:55:12 Yes but we neither trust nor like Ruskies. If they want to live on the American Planet, they should elect another Yeltsin, sell all their oil&gas resources to US companies, implement decisions taken in Washington and continue to disintegrate into small pieces.

1563 2018-10-22 20:54:13 Calgary started on their green line since money was guaranteed - not so for Edmonton - NDP's budget is getting hit hard now- losing a lot of $$ since oil differential is so great - grants will be delayed - if UCP forms gov't - first order of business is to cancel carbon tax .
1564 2018-10-22 20:54:08 i remember making jollof rice and beans for my elder bro back in 2008, hmmmmmm literally you could swim in the groundnut oil. Lol he encouraged me though after eating.
1565 2018-10-22 20:53:55 My goodness my whole house smells delicious... I've got whole garlic cloves and cabbage steaks smothered in olive oil and seasonings in the oven baking right now... mmmmmm soooo yummy
1566 2018-10-22 20:53:54 That aside, he mischievously forgot to factor in the fact that crude oil fell to as low as 28dpb at some point during the period under review. #SelectiveAmnesia

1571 2018-10-22 20:53:00 I have a real thing for sweet potato chips. I was wondering if I could cut them into chips and toss them in oil and open freeze them, so they’d be like oven chips. What do you think?
1572 2018-10-22 20:52:59 i already have my Tuesday planned out to where i can go vote + go get an oil change. when did i become this???

1580 2018-10-22 20:51:19 MSFT and V are going to start lifting tech off the ground on wed. Thus fri momentum shld carry tru the weekend when saudis assure more oil and interest rate levels. then all we need is to get thru a balanced election and talk of trump meeting Xi for a rally

1582 2018-10-22 20:51:12 I thought America was an awful, lawless, racist, rape culture enthusiastic country that loves oil more than people. At least that's what I read on Twitter.
1583 2018-10-22 20:51:10 The WEST is hoping this means Central Canada will quit buying oil from Saudi Arabia and get moving Western Oil to Quebec/Ontario.  Can we expect this to happen sooner than later?
1584 2018-10-22 20:51:05 Cruz is for big oil companies and coal. Guess Cruz voters don’t mind breathing dirty air and allowing Cruz make big money. He doesn’t care about us. I guarantee you will breathe dirty air and you won’t get higher wages if Cruz wins.  That’s why I voted Beto!
1585 2018-10-22 20:50:52 Talmbout CBD oil?

1590 2018-10-22 20:50:20 If there #fossilfuel #corporations are allowed in there with their drilling machines searching for #oil they will probably cause a massive oil spill disaster & kill all the remaining wildlife theyve not killed elsewhere. on the plus side they will discover artefacts from Atlantis
1591 2018-10-22 20:50:13 This is awful news. We'd better give the tax revenue to London in case there are demand fluctuations or price drops. Or something.

Gawd save us from the curse of oil ownership!

1594 2018-10-22 20:49:34 FFS, just look it up, you've got the entire internet at your fingertips. 11% of US oil imports are from SA, but you're only 3% of their export market. They sell 10% to China, who will not join any embargo. The USA just isn't as important as you think.
1595 2018-10-22 20:49:28 Coz I almost asked did they discover oil off the the Namibian coast line ...
1596 2018-10-22 20:49:16 oh yes, but by all means, let's keep buying Saudi oil instead of building a West to East pipeline in Canada.

1602 2018-10-22 20:48:58 I burned the b-jesus out of my finger earlier. All I had was CBD oil near me. I ran that b under ice cold water and slapped some CBD oil on that bad boy..... it doesn't hurt anymore and I'm like 100% it's already going away
1603 2018-10-22 20:48:52 If you think O'Rourke cares about you, then I have some real estate on the moon to sell you. Sure, he's a slick snake oil salesman, and certainly more charismatic than Ted Cruz, but that's all.  His dismal voting record speaks volumes.

1607 2018-10-22 20:48:33 Venezuela is collapsing b/c of decades of corrupt fascist dictators & phony elections & a one trick economy, oil. They aren’t really socialist. Norway, Sweden & Denmark are socialist nations and they’re doing fine. As for narco, are you aware of our opioid crisis in the US?

1610 2018-10-22 20:48:15 thank youuu  it’s not at its best right now but I try to maintain it best I can with hot oil treatments and deep conditioning
1611 2018-10-22 20:48:15 All you are doing is showing your crass ignorance. Go away and ask Barron to explain the rather more critical and dangerous levels of carbon- and nitrogen-based pollution that your filthy coal and oil industries are creating.  You appal me, and the rest of the world.
1612 2018-10-22 20:48:05 Careful if you have pets though! Peppermint oil can be dangerous to cats and dogs if they ingest it.
1613 2018-10-22 20:48:00 Misguided, not to say childish interpretarion. As long as the OPEC gets paid for oil in US dollars and not in Remnimbis or Rubles there is a chance to save the West. If the price to pay is to turn the blind eye to  muslim despot killing his subjects, so be it.

1616 2018-10-22 20:47:41 2018’s average job growth was the strongest since 1997 with 2.5 million jobs added to the economy. Oil is at $70 a barrel. Need i say more?
1617 2018-10-22 20:47:35 Their argan oil is good but afterall it's argan oil kot 
1618 2018-10-22 20:47:32 Forget oil, but just picture this (unlikely but not impossible) scenario: Saudi and China dumping US treasuries. How can pushing Saudi closer to China help? That’s what is taking place right now. It can destroy the West.

1759 2018-10-22 20:31:50 If Trump dumps deal with Saudi, then they do not have get our weapons but we do not get their oil AND they buy weapons from Russia instead. Other than Israel they are our biggest ally in the MidEast

1761 2018-10-22 20:31:44 I haven't changed my oil since February and I'm still 500 miles under the service mileage. But I also only drive my car to the airport and sephora which are both only 4 miles away from me.
1762 2018-10-22 20:31:39 We need to stop acting like we still need Saudi oil. #Justice4Jamal

1766 2018-10-22 20:31:05 Lets hope we think twice about a trade deal with Saudi Arabia, what are selling apart from oil, hand saws?
1767 2018-10-22 20:30:55 And that's without masses of oil in their waters

1770 2018-10-22 20:30:39 Wait... really?
Where's my paycheque?

I want oil refined in Canada and used here, so we don't have to import from Saudi Arabia. I want energy independence.

The Koch brothers (American) and Sinclair media (American) are funding my opposition. Who is funding me?
1771 2018-10-22 20:30:38 Did they get oil put on their tummies?

1778 2018-10-22 20:29:48 By opposing energy east the Green Party is enabling Saudi to continue selling us their oil. Last time I checked us Albertans don’t throw protestors in prison, have public executions or murder journalists. Let’s hurt them by getting our ethical oil to the world market.

You'd be surprised how much trash is talked in car shops, on farms and on oil fields.

Hell, you'd be very surprised how much trash is talked with a group of working class rural men hanging out. It's part of the culture out here.

1784 2018-10-22 20:29:31 My mother also used those canned white potatoes for a sugar-browned Danish dish for Christmas dinner....  tho I'm kinda liking the oil, salt, paprika, garlic thing you lot got going over there.  
1785 2018-10-22 20:29:29 It helps so many people. I love CBD oil without THC,  but some people like the THC. It should be legal Worldwide.
1786 2018-10-22 20:29:26 Just take the bulb out and add more oil, that’s what I do.
1787 2018-10-22 20:29:22 #EQT..... This market will be huge!
1788 2018-10-22 20:29:21 I'd try a combination of some intense exercise during the day to help really shut down at night and also whatever you find good for a mild sedative. People have suggested some already. I find a bit of lavender oil on my wrists is helpful. Good luck
1789 2018-10-22 20:29:16 Thanks for the advice. I looked up “snake oil saleman” and Trump face came up. Thanks!!! Now I know what it is!!! #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
1790 2018-10-22 20:29:10 Zinc and vitamin C are my go to supplements to prevent or lessen the effects of the cold and flu. I also love to diffuse tea tree essential oil. What are favorite ways to combat the flu season?
1791 2018-10-22 20:29:08 I would recommend our slippery soaps face/body bars in calendula & oatmeal to try first. They’re oil & clay based & really gentle on the skin.
1792 2018-10-22 20:29:05 Well, it starts with the fact that leftists are universally uneducated, and don't have a fundamental understanding of what fascism actually is.  Nor are they able to distinguish the reality of social justice, from the Utopian vision that snake oil social justice promises.
1793 2018-10-22 20:29:03 I would never bleach my skin to be lighter. Darkskin is sexy, especially when there's oil on it.
1794 2018-10-22 20:28:56 The girl at pink told me their new lip oil is like “lip gloss on crack” and i LOVE lipgloss so i spent $10 on the shit and it’s shitty, this is why i have trust issues

1800 2018-10-22 20:28:23 Surprising number of #CPC minions out claiming "Canada buying oil" does not mean "Canada buying oil" It really means Trudeau is personally "allowing" private companies to by Saudi oil. I guess that "free market" thing really means "Government intervention" to the #CPC
1801 2018-10-22 20:28:23 Trump is such a snake oil salesman.
1802 2018-10-22 20:28:18 I just got an oil change & I WANT MY HONDA BACK
1803 2018-10-22 20:28:07 @donlemon   he wants to promise a tax cut after the election sounds like snake oil to me we don't need a tax cut from that imbecille the deficit is too large already
1804 2018-10-22 20:28:04 D'ya remember?!?! D'ya remember?!?! When you're trying to turn Peter Kay over but your brass hand seizes up and you've run out of brass hand oil?! #athleticomince

1806 2018-10-22 20:27:57 One of my case fans stopped spinning, but you could tell it was trying. I used a tiny bit of olive oil on a qtip and put some on the bearing. Basically just looked up DW 40 alternatives and made sure it wouldn't break anything. A temporary fix but it worked :p
1807 2018-10-22 20:27:57 When a Snake Oil Salesman named #Trump became President. As we know from past rants about Obama, The President is responsible for everything, period. How long has the GOP shirked humanitarian responsibility? Forever... #BlueWave #GOPLies
1808 2018-10-22 20:27:54 Venezuelan oil requires far more refining than Saudi or American oil.
1809 2018-10-22 20:27:52 No, the USA accounts for only about 3% of SA oil exports, they sell 3x more to China. However the US imports 11% of its oil from SA. They've got you over, quite literally, a barrel.
1810 2018-10-22 20:27:50 Ok. I can oil You
1811 2018-10-22 20:27:40 @ChrisCuomo   he wants to promise a tax cut after the election sounds like snake oil to me we don't need a tax cut from that imbecille the deficit is too large already
1812 2018-10-22 20:27:35 That literally would have been the next step after bleeding oil lines
1813 2018-10-22 20:27:21 That's the nature of social justice.  It's a snake oil ideology, the reality of which is entirely different from the Utopian vision it promises.
1814 2018-10-22 20:27:10 If it’s an oil aga , it should last forever . Ours is 1928!
1815 2018-10-22 20:26:36 You'd rather buy oil from saudi arabia than use it in Canada?
1816 2018-10-22 20:26:25 A few years ago you tweeted the Saudis were behind the 9/11 Twin Towers attack on Americans

but hey  ....#Oil #Armsdeals
1817 2018-10-22 20:26:21 What's regressive is letting foreign owned-mine oil workers kill themselves when oil prices drop, instead of using oil taxation to invest in alternative energy sources and local energy production and supporting workers through tough times.
1818 2018-10-22 20:26:20 Huh weird. The cream isn’t dented with anything except the hemp oil
1819 2018-10-22 20:26:13 The oil that you are talking about is sufficient for domestic use and nothing else.
1820 2018-10-22 20:26:11 What about palm oil huh
1821 2018-10-22 20:26:10 Why do you invite so many people from te West then? It could be said that you even can‘t drill a hole in the desert to get your own oil without help from the West.
1822 2018-10-22 20:26:09 Oil Closes Below $70 for Fourth Session as Stockpiles Accumulate

- Saudi Arabian oil chief takes embargo-style tactics off table

- U.S. inventories expanding at fastest pace since early 2017

- Saudi Arabia vows to raise oil output
1823 2018-10-22 20:26:02 It's very simple. Trump's base is the least educated, least intelligent, most superstitious segment of our society. They've always bought snake oil.
1824 2018-10-22 20:25:59 I'll get you a lifetime supply of oregano oil
1825 2018-10-22 20:25:57 AND you have the oil industry buying off the media. I just saw Exxon advertising during the NFL on how many jobs the oil industry creates. The only purpose of that ad is to funnel money to the media to make them play nice. This is why the media loves oil and wars.
1826 2018-10-22 20:25:45 Oil is on Captain mode!

1831 2018-10-22 20:25:21 That guy should be carful when he deals with Saudi Arabia away of CNN news .
Saudi Oil supplies had been suspend . Richard Nixon knew that early as same as Trump now . Again Saudi Arabia are not banana republic .
1832 2018-10-22 20:24:59 Buy oil anywhere else you can including from Iran. UN resolution of condemnation, even imposing sanctions, all countries publicly condemning Saudi Arabia’s rogue behaviour. UK,France,Germany, NZ & others ( not yet the USA) already have.
1833 2018-10-22 20:24:58 For @realDonaldTrump , all brown people are unwelcome and from the same “shithole”  unless they invest in his property or oil deals.
1834 2018-10-22 20:24:58 Lmao one day freshman year,
My friend and I decided to make fried chicken. We put the oil on the stove and went to our rooms waiting for it to heat up. Next thing I remember the pot was on fire

1843 2018-10-22 20:24:02 Sometimes, I get excited about new or new-to-me products that expressly declare they are vegan, and then forget to check for palm oil. Ugh.

@VegaTeam, please take the palm kernal oil out of those delicious protein bars so that I can buy them again.

Today that narratives is gradually changing
1847 2018-10-22 20:23:23 My mom uses lash boost by rodan and fields. There's other brands out there too that might be more affordable. Castor oil works too! And you can use it on your eyebrows
1848 2018-10-22 20:23:12 Nor worry, I go use palm oil chop my rice, you can keep your stew biko
1849 2018-10-22 20:23:02 I've long said we shouldn't ally w/countries who are egregious human rights violators. And yet...we sell them arms. Our politicians (L&R) take huge sums of $. We help them fight their neighbors for oil. Do I know why this 1 suddenly matters when most never cared before? No.
1850 2018-10-22 20:22:58 man i burnt my hand cooking with olive oil again now im gonna have to use my last hello kitty bandaid 
1851 2018-10-22 20:22:57 I remember a car crashing the wall of a gas station burning a girl inside frying chicken  .. The hot oil cooked that poor child .. Pylons were installed in hindsight .. If cars come within so many feet of a wall it should be a mandatory law for those pylons to exist.
1852 2018-10-22 20:22:51 Looks like a fucking oil spill up in the sky.  Disgusting. Shameful
1853 2018-10-22 20:22:44 Parchment paper makes for easy cleanup, but if you want your potatoes to be crispy(er), best to leave it out. If you oil the pan, that and the fat from the chicken will keep them from sticking, and make them golden brown & delicious!
1854 2018-10-22 20:22:44 Oh! Also! When you do shampoo/condition your hair, rinse with cold water! Hot/warm water accellarates the fading process, especially in semi-permanent colors! Also putting in coconut oil after a washing day helps a lot make it moisturized!  lasts a long time! 
1855 2018-10-22 20:22:37 Ironic that the people who most hate Muslims are fully dedicated to perpetuating ignorance and assuring we continue to send billions of oil dollars to the middle east. 

If we would have just pushed clean green early, the middle east would be far less influential today.

1862 2018-10-22 20:21:46 In Shampoo and Moisturiser Ads, "Essential Oils" means that the oil gives off a distinctive scent, not that they're essential.
1863 2018-10-22 20:21:37 Not missing any point in anyway whatsoever. I fully recognize partisan spin, bias and misdirection. The words "Canada imports oil" is misleading and needs to be challenged.
1864 2018-10-22 20:21:25 Gave to agree, i’ve warned people.  Old Enegi oil, been spouting about newfoundland for over 10 years...
1865 2018-10-22 20:21:22 So, Canadians:  Does Canada use any of its own oil?  Or does it import its oil primarily?
1866 2018-10-22 20:21:19 You put the virgin in extra virgin olive oil
1867 2018-10-22 20:21:13 Thanks Obama. Obama passed the Lilly Ledbetter Act that guarantees equal pay for women. But Trump froze the equal pay bill. So f*ck Ivanka! She is selling voters fraud just like she frauded people of money selling Trump properties. Ivanka is nothing more than a snake oil salesman

1871 2018-10-22 20:21:01 Give me a fricking break!

1872 2018-10-22 20:20:55 What about a pipeline for Canadian oil? Don’t buy their oil.
1873 2018-10-22 20:20:48 What’s your skin type? Also Are you looking to reduce oil, prevent dryness, or even skin tone?

1885 2018-10-22 20:19:35 SA can murder and commit atrocities continuously but  CDN’s refuse to accept that countries like Saudi would not do all they can to landlock our oil. We need to come to the realization that they do not play by the same rules as we do.
1886 2018-10-22 20:19:25 Well, the oil will actually be overflowing & contaminated with toxic additives the EPA has just taken off the banned list so don't touch it!

1893 2018-10-22 20:18:45 Habe auch viel probiert. Bei jedem Shampoo gabs probleme, bis hin zu starkem Kopfhaut jucken. Aber Jason and the Argan Oil hat mir geholfen, super Bombe! 
1894 2018-10-22 20:18:36 Oil dictatorship 
1895 2018-10-22 20:18:13 Why has the West listbits moral compass? Oil, money, weapons sales. Is it really worth supporting such a vile regime?
1896 2018-10-22 20:18:08 Hmmm Baa Magana chairman hahaha wish diz would be true
1897 2018-10-22 20:18:04 It also takes a lot of 'gall' for Trumptanic to claim on one hand we don't rely on the Saudis for oil because the U.S. is the largest exporter of petroleum and then turns around we need them to buy military weaponry.
1898 2018-10-22 20:17:53 Do not touch fire. Like. Ever. Don’t spec into it, don’t make fire arrows. You will set the enemy on fire, and the hay. And the tent. And the oil. And the grass. And yourself. And a wolf.

The wolf and you will die at the same time.
1899 2018-10-22 20:17:45 Dammy knows how to cook village jollof rice with ponmo meat and palm oil. I’m blessed god. Na to go see her parents plis
1900 2018-10-22 20:17:40 Suck all that oil out of the ground, burn it in cars, and when it runs out you’re irrelevant.  Who saw this coming?
1901 2018-10-22 20:17:31 @davidsocomedy what cbd oil do you use?
1902 2018-10-22 20:17:30 Lol I happened to me the first few times it’s always good to put oil on before... its rough when it’s dry and it irritates the skin
1903 2018-10-22 20:17:29 自分が先輩達と比べて手が遅いのが当たり前ってこと完全に抜け落ちてた……経験も知識も違うんだから一列に頑張ってたら一人だけ遅れるのは当たり前だ

1906 2018-10-22 20:17:02 Don’t go to sears, my brother got an oil change there and they forgot the oil, destroyed his engine and had to sue them to get a replacement.
1907 2018-10-22 20:16:49 Na época, diziam que o shale oil (de xisto, dos EUA) valeria mais a pena que o pré sal brasileiro. Hoje, o shale só vale a pena com o barril acima de us$65, um investimento com maior risco que o pré sal,  que vale a pena acima de 40 (hoje está 80)
1908 2018-10-22 20:16:46 #NationalEmergy... Sounds the alarms. Text the nation. Alert the militias.
People are seeking asylum from the countries we could care less about because they don't have oil and buy our military weapons! Build a wall...

1922 2018-10-22 20:15:33 Obama's #Irandeal, oil prices has gone down by $30pb.
#Trump:hang on acminute, I don't like it, very bad deal. I am cancelling the deal. Oil price's gone up from $55pb to $80pb.Saudis will make more  and so am I.
1923 2018-10-22 20:15:21 How will KD guys be like
1924 2018-10-22 20:15:15 How many journalists and ordinary citizens did the Saudi gov killed in the last 5-years? Why is only one family benefiting from oil?
1925 2018-10-22 20:15:01 An olive oil thread!?
1926 2018-10-22 20:14:40 It's a question of who has whom by the throat. If Saudi squeezes, the US swoons. Also they buy weapons, but it's mainly about who has the oil.
1927 2018-10-22 20:14:33 Christiano just let me put eye cream and rose hip oil on his face

1929 2018-10-22 20:14:18 "Carbon Tax." Idea, created at a luncheon between Al Gore and his buddy at Enron.  The real goal to make America weak and make China stronger & make oil prices rise. You are naive. Fake science bought and paid for.  Nature doesn't stop creating oil.  Climate has natural cycles.
1930 2018-10-22 20:14:12 Did you hear about the dyslexic classic car fan , he couldn’t get an oil cap at an LGBT meeting

1932 2018-10-22 20:14:02 There was an off ramp by my parents, off I-5, that had a huge hump at the bottom. I'd try to hit it and catch as much air as possible. Nearly tore the oil pan off once. Think of that everytime my 16 year drives away from the house. So... I got him a minivan. Teenagers ARE dumb.
1933 2018-10-22 20:13:58 cbd oil and epsom salt baths
1934 2018-10-22 20:13:54 I need a oil change and some new tires 
1935 2018-10-22 20:13:49 Castor oil >>>> Coconut oil 

For hair ..
1936 2018-10-22 20:13:43 This is what happened at an AMERICAN CONSULATE and we have still not had answers from Hillary&Obama so why all the oil sided questions about what the Saudis did ? I want to know about what didn't happen in Benghaz I  Where were our leaders ?  Turkey was bad. This was worse !
1937 2018-10-22 20:13:39 That jamaican black castor oil got the top on my head oily.
1938 2018-10-22 20:13:38 Thankyou Pete. Closing down the dolphin shows, ending the dog meat trade and stopping palm oil demand killing orang-utans- much to do across Indonesia.
1939 2018-10-22 20:13:36 we are. we can do both. just like how i spend endless amounts of time criticizing the oil industry, ill criticize the sex industry too. i dont spend all my time talking about sex work, this is literally the first time ive engaged in a discussion about it on twitter

OIL！
1941 2018-10-22 20:13:23 You haven’t taken account of direct transfer of oil that is allocated to ‘other region’. I’ll leave you to yours
1942 2018-10-22 20:13:13 Oil resedue on that mf now, get the napkins
1943 2018-10-22 20:13:05 Not really! Not while they have control of the spicket! Open new refineries and DRILL BABY DRILL! Let their oil be like their sand! Take care of Israel! Pray!
1944 2018-10-22 20:13:02 The world's countries need to stop taking oil from these murdering devils!   There are other sources!  Let them eat their arrogance and effin wealth!
1945 2018-10-22 20:13:01 Honeyyyy or olive oil 
1946 2018-10-22 20:13:00 The only good thing about this is it will hopefully end the snake oil salesmen on the left like Bernie who have been pushing for the same policies.
1947 2018-10-22 20:12:33 So Heid you took the plunge with PHE  What are your thoughts regarding funding? CEO purchase shows confidence but looks to me like a placing needed soon
1948 2018-10-22 20:12:31 If we want to scare Saudi get our oil to the world market and stop buying their oil.
1949 2018-10-22 20:12:05 A smoothie is a blended fruit with liquids added: avocado+olive oil garlic salt etc
1950 2018-10-22 20:11:44 "THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THIS TYPE OF MESS BEING LEFT UNCHECKED OR UNCLEANED" Oil companies need to be held accountable for "ANY" mess that they make.
1951 2018-10-22 20:11:38 Yes, and the anti-vaxxers are the snake oil vendors selling data self - service solutions 'because data will organise itself magically' ;-)
1952 2018-10-22 20:11:36 Oh. Cool table.
So Hersey’s syrup & motor oil
Could theoretically unclogg a drain.
1953 2018-10-22 20:11:34 madam pls drink black seed oil mix with honey daily morning and night
1954 2018-10-22 20:11:32 It's sad. Money and oil for not equal wisdom and knowledge. Wish we could find a new energy source and be done with all Saudis
1955 2018-10-22 20:11:23 If the oil and gas won’t destroy the quality of life, the growth certainly will @SierraClub @SierraClubCO @WildEarthGuards @ConservationCO @jaredpolis @nrdc @edf @SteadyStateEcon

1960 2018-10-22 20:10:53 Great read CW!  Shame they had to move to Holland for cannabis oil treatment!
1961 2018-10-22 20:10:52 Put a bit of R30 or R40 in a tealight oil burner. Oh boy....it works a treat 
1962 2018-10-22 20:10:46 Ku Uzumba kwenyu wakuchinjisa 2l cooking oil nembudzi kkkkkkk
1963 2018-10-22 20:10:45 Nobody ever called oil "Texas tea" except for Gary Snidleman, who until 1987 held the world record for number of lifetime stomach pumpings.
1964 2018-10-22 20:10:45 Taylor Energy has A FOURTEEN YEAR oil spill going on in the Gulf of Mexico?!?
1965 2018-10-22 20:10:44 Yes yes let's put nami next to a bunch of hot boiling oil
1966 2018-10-22 20:10:44 Marinating my chicken in my #bloodorange olive oil based marinade 
1967 2018-10-22 20:10:44 Nothing to do with the oil the Saudis have that's why us or America won't do anything
1968 2018-10-22 20:10:42 The Navy: We're gonna throw metal trash overboard and dump water mixed with engine oil into the ocean. Pollution? Who cares, it's international waters baby!!

Also the Navy: You didn't fold your blankets or make your bed? You disgusting animal, were you raised in a barn?
1969 2018-10-22 20:10:35 And I bet this stuff tastes like a 100 years old gun oil

1973 2018-10-22 20:10:24 we have transformed from holding a Beggars Bowl to buying Russian missiles, Iran oil, and humongous infrastructure development which was unthinkable few years back, now as financially sound country and our strength in unity India will achieve everything a true Indian can dream of

1975 2018-10-22 20:10:20 What about cooking oil??
1976 2018-10-22 20:10:18 It works, HerbalLife, CBD oil, etc.
1977 2018-10-22 20:10:14 So w oil (or if oil-free, some of the coconut milk fat), toast spices (except salt) until fragrant. Add in ginger, garlic, onions until cooked. Dump in chickpeas, tomatoes, finally coconut milk. Serve with lime zest/juice and cilantro. Easily a 20 min recipe start to finish
1978 2018-10-22 20:10:07 The oil/gas/coal fossil economy can't go circular, not on a human timescale. Time to stop pretending. To go circular we need to reduce #consumption, #recycle effectively & move to #renewable feedstock. This is the recipe for a sustainable #biobased #circulareconomy

1980 2018-10-22 20:09:47 Voting is important. But, because we can never be sure those issues will be address in legislatures, let alone passed, personal responsibility is important.

A plant-based diet is the best choice you can make to help the Environment (animals & yourself).

And, eliminate palm oil!
1981 2018-10-22 20:09:44 Not an oil painting

1984 2018-10-22 20:09:17 Meh... I'd rather have a presidential candidate that isn't owned by the oil and gas industry....... (big ask, I know..)
1985 2018-10-22 20:09:16 Cringeworthy moment of the day, while waiting for my oil change:
Mechanic: How’s your family been?
Customer: Not bad, my daughter has mono, though.
M: Ha! Wonder how she got that! Kissing disease, huh‽ Lol
C: Well, she’s 8 years old.
*dead silence in the entire establishment*

1987 2018-10-22 20:08:54 Again I say air freshener. Hand sanitizer with added essential oil. 
1988 2018-10-22 20:08:16 So healthcare is prohibitively expensive and the administration is trying to legislate my identity out of existence, but what I'm really stressing right now is zinc phosphate additives because oil is about the only thing I can expect my honest effort to actually change.
1989 2018-10-22 20:08:15 Lol make your popcorn in cannibus oil and then pour cannibus butter on top lol smh
1990 2018-10-22 20:07:51 So your idea is to pay multiple billions on buying offshore oil and making life difficult for working families. That your buddy justin wants to screw taxes out of those families. Better think about your union members they may have to give up tax deductions.
1991 2018-10-22 20:07:46 Oil.
1992 2018-10-22 20:07:39 Catfish back  @shashadarlyn
1993 2018-10-22 20:07:32 Man listen ! I need somebody to take my car to the shop for a oil change. My body is glued to my bed
1994 2018-10-22 20:07:31 Mr president with MEDURO and VENEZUELA in building oil infrastructure you can control price and like the fed have a said in inflation! and at times of recession have control for economy to get out of!
1995 2018-10-22 20:07:31 Guitar Lessons
“Guitar Teacher, want some of my CBD soda?”
“No Billy”
“Guitar Teacher, how about my CBD soap, funny snacks olive oil or jam?”
“Billy did someone talk you into buying a bunch of random CBD products?”
“Yes Guitar Teacher, and these darn magic beans”
1996 2018-10-22 20:07:21 Including oil & gas I presume
1997 2018-10-22 20:07:17 Your head get oil
1998 2018-10-22 20:07:13 My ma taught me to roast them around the chicken. I toss them with olive oil and herbs. I like to halve them and let them go for over an hour, flipping them only occasionally so they get crusty. She also taught me to stuff the chicken with vegetables and herbs. Un bon repas!
1999 2018-10-22 20:07:06 I need to start working out more 
2000 2018-10-22 20:06:56 BP petrol prices took my finances down a level.

When oil prices collapsed the oil companies complained like buggery and asked for tax payer help iirc.
2001 2018-10-22 20:06:47 Tar sands clean and ethical?  Using 1 unit if energy to get out 3 units of oil? That’s not accounting for the environmental cost either. Hardly ethical.
2002 2018-10-22 20:06:34 Remembering the same truck getting my brother and and my car from Germany after oil cooler and head gasket failure. Great looking truck.
2003 2018-10-22 20:06:33 This is a good start
2004 2018-10-22 20:06:28 And Trump is planning on surrounding both coasts with oil platforms owned BY HIS FUNDERS. HOW MUCH WILL THEY OWE HIM?
2005 2018-10-22 20:06:28 Hi there! It is about immersion cooling systems mostly. Some producers use synthetic oil which probably can burn your ASICS. But there are systems with bluemead coolant like Beeminer's and it is impossible to burn it. This immersion cooling system can level up hash rate  + 50%
2006 2018-10-22 20:06:02 1 cup almond milk, 1 cinnamon stick, 1/2 teaspoon turmeric, 1/2-inch piece ginger, 
1 tablespoon agave, 1 tablespoon virgin coconut oil, 1/4 teaspoon whole black peppercorns, and a sprinkle of cardamom, allspice, and ground clove.
2007 2018-10-22 20:05:57 On our way home from MD yesterday, we drove by a shop that said “Pumpkin Spice Oil Changes are here!”
 #PSL #clever
2008 2018-10-22 20:05:50 While 29.000 gallons of #oil runs into the #Mexicangulf EVERY day since 2004. #environment enemy #1, #lying overweight #potus #trump, wants to open up for more offshore oil drilling - good luck #Florida
2009 2018-10-22 20:05:44 I was reffing to the discount. Canadian taxpayers are the one who lose the most because of it. Regardless where we live. Where does money come from for public services. Oil and gas sector is one of the biggest contributors. I am btw politically neutral but not ignorant
2010 2018-10-22 20:05:26 just took a picture of myself and I’m so damn greasy I look like a damn oil painting
2011 2018-10-22 20:05:24 Anyone can enter any mosque regardless of madhab/fiqh. Makkah & Medina were historically the hub of trade in Hijaz & its economic bloodline. Everybody was welcome there under Umayyads, Abbasids, Fatimids or Ottomans. Saudis limited it to Muslims after the oil boom.
2012 2018-10-22 20:05:14 全員同じ様な数持ってるから無理と言わずに取ったけど、10歳近く年上の方々と同じ様な仕事ぶりできるわけないやんな、アホか自分、同じスピードで同じ内容ができるわけないやん、遅くて当たり前だということに今日気付いた
2013 2018-10-22 20:05:02 Coconut oil cured my dry scalp AND my SAD.
2014 2018-10-22 20:05:02 I feel like car insurances should handle all car maintenance (tire changes, oil changes, etc)
2015 2018-10-22 20:05:00 Thanks si. Not sure it's especially healthier but it looks nice, always been pleased when I've made cakes with oil before
2016 2018-10-22 20:04:58 もう呆れられてるかもなぁ
2017 2018-10-22 20:04:42 Stop using oil people and a lot of this will go away
2018 2018-10-22 20:04:33 I do not think they care where oil is purchased.  This is why it appears to be “anywhere but Alberta” and why the NEP came about. The underlying concern is power & population moves from the east to the west, displacing their “rightful” position in Canada. This is about power
2019 2018-10-22 20:04:16 They were oil business buddies.
2020 2018-10-22 20:04:07 Thanks for the link. That's pretty funny that US oil companies blame others for producing too much and causing the price crash

2022 2018-10-22 20:03:52 To help save money just DIY a costume at home. Pretty simple and cheap. Start by covering yourself in flour, then paint yourself in some egg wash, then put another layer of flour. To finish it off so you don't look like a ghost dip your costume into hot oil until nice and gold.
2023 2018-10-22 20:03:51 Linden and Pierson today til 6 gang. Change your oil,  Change a life. $10.39 from every oil change at Insta-Lube today, goes toward the cause! Thanks for your help!!!
2024 2018-10-22 20:03:51 So, by relaxing environmental regulations on Domestic energy production, USA exports oil, reducing the income for the Saudi's, so they're running out of money.  Odd thing for Trump to do see as how you alleged in your article Trump is somehow profiting from the Saudi economy.
2025 2018-10-22 20:03:43 Time for my 2nd Isaproshake with coconut oil/milk, & I love it lots.
2026 2018-10-22 20:03:27 Lynsey took my car this morning to get me an oil change and fill my tank up. If that’s not the most “things you love to see...that” moment ever idk what is.

2031 2018-10-22 20:03:03 You're perfectly normal.
Poor execution
2032 2018-10-22 20:03:00 Just because they have money and oil is no reason to keep ties with them. Money does not equal wisdom and intelligence.
2033 2018-10-22 20:02:52 So not buying Saudi Oil is not an option? No money, no buying arms. CBC investigative programs are excellent but Wendy Melsey and Rosemary Barton need to remember what a journalist is!

2037 2018-10-22 20:02:41 Would I say hunger is real in this land or people ready to cash in on any gift at all as long as its free..... Saw them sharing A packed transparent mini bag with Raw rice,  sachet tin  and groundnut oil in one........ At Ilupeju.
2038 2018-10-22 20:02:36 Does anyone hate getting their oil changed as much as me? 
2039 2018-10-22 20:02:30 You're going to have keep spending if you cut those things cuz every so often disaster strikes. Hurricane, flood, plaque, oil spill. To cut spending the best thing is to stay out of wars and conflicts we don't need to be in.

2042 2018-10-22 20:02:23 You are not satisfied , you need more oil old man ?!
2043 2018-10-22 20:02:21 What happened to ND's budget when oil crashed?
2044 2018-10-22 20:02:16 Oh, okay. If these industries are feasible then why do they need to be subsidized (massively) by the oil sector?
2045 2018-10-22 20:02:15 Come to the dealership for an oil change, leave possibly buying a new car 
2046 2018-10-22 20:02:05 O'Rourke is a Leftist who is BAD for TEXAS. The Texas economy is growing, we are fighting against Obama policies that allow invasion on the southern border, & oil is booming. O'Rourke would reverse all of this. Vote for a conservative leader that's good for TX @tedcruz.

2049 2018-10-22 20:01:49 The news manipulators in Canada can sure concoct an ugly picture of the oil sands refineries when needed. In this picture they used a storm laden sky to back a water vapor cloud.

2054 2018-10-22 20:01:05 You’re both right, however we need our own oil to reduce dependency, and ween ourselves off of it ASAP, towards green energy, using the revenue from our own oil to fund the research and initiatives.

2066 2018-10-22 19:59:42 This coconut oil got my face soft as shit or maybe it’s something else 
2067 2018-10-22 19:59:34 Doesn’t effect the crude oil sources. However, we/I shouldn’t react ourselves especially as I have a habit of saying stuff and I think to a certain extent it should be allowed.

When PDP handed over oil sector to their girlfriends, no noise.
2069 2018-10-22 19:59:24 Got me? I immigration is definitely a politically charged issue tho so the squeaky wheel gets the oil.
2070 2018-10-22 19:59:17 Garlic oil or garlic granules is my cheat-y yet less wasteful approach these days!
2071 2018-10-22 19:59:14 We have the opportunity, but the foreign corporations that own our oil production don't want to sell it back to Canadians or refine it here.

We are worth the expense of a new refinery built in Alberta,
Why aren't you supporting nationalization of our energy?
2072 2018-10-22 19:59:13 Nope. If Alberta can make an economy out of oil, they can make it out of less dirty energy.
2073 2018-10-22 19:59:02 We are so proud of you my in laws and their whole family voted for you today!! And yes your grandma was right putting holy oil on you I do use it.

2075 2018-10-22 19:58:50 opec controls the oil prices not us. We are the ones that pretty soon won't have to use there oil we make enough in our own country we don't need opec to control the gas prices

2077 2018-10-22 19:58:32 It's even more confusing when u research the politics of growing oil crops for plastics! And biodegradable plastics can be made from mineral oils, and that some bio-plastic isn't biodegradable it's just plastic made from plant oil! #confused #EthicalHour
2078 2018-10-22 19:58:32 The argument Big Oil is making in their ads is laughably in bad faith.
2079 2018-10-22 19:58:20 nope,i'm the troublemaker.

2080 2018-10-22 19:58:17 Good work, Mr Squiggle! It looks just like *Oil!*. #CardsAgainstHumanity
2081 2018-10-22 19:57:52 The Saudi "Royal" family is nothing but a murderer, sick and criminal gang with plenty of money and power. All decent countries should expulse saudi diplomats from their land, and consider an oil embargo an act of war.
2082 2018-10-22 19:57:48 Yes, we should absolutely nationalize our oil!
No more foreign investors - we should be funding refineries and keeping our oil production steady, providing energy to Canadians.

But tell that to foreign investors! They won't like it, Wilson.
2083 2018-10-22 19:57:47 Ahhh!   The smell of fuel stabilizer and fogging oil is in the air!!!  It’s that time of year again to get your boat in for winterization and shrink wrap!!!! We also have a few spaces that are still available for inside boat storage.  Don’t wait until the last minute!!!
2084 2018-10-22 19:57:44 USA is now a net exporter of fossil fuel, which coupled with Saudi’s attempted oil dumping scheme to damage American Fracking , are what happened to the Saudi economy.
Now Americans r getting Rich instead of Saudis, that's punishment 4 9/11 that will hurt them more
2085 2018-10-22 19:57:37 I love robotic oil poffins~!
2086 2018-10-22 19:57:36 I’ve been doing my best saving money then I have to pay for a fucking oil change 
2087 2018-10-22 19:57:34 Justifying the destruction of our planet and life by stating it creates jobs is abhorrent. Using that argument, we can say that prostitution and selling heroin creates jobs too.  
A 14-year-long oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico verges on becoming one of the worst in U.S. history
2088 2018-10-22 19:57:33 Lolz. Oil = profit. What happened when prices went down. And wages are livable because no one wants to live there. You have to pay extra to get employees.
2089 2018-10-22 19:57:33 There is no oil there so our politicians don’t care about the crisis there, plain and simple
2090 2018-10-22 19:57:26 Bouta get my bitch this oil change

They're AMAZINGLY tasty.

Better to stop  buying Saudi oil. Canada has oil and owns a pipeline. Germany didn't cancel just put project on hold

2135 2018-10-22 19:53:02 Saudi oil represents ten percent of the Canadian market. Tell Mr. Irving, not government, to build a refinery capable of processing dilbit, And maybe the federal government might make up for the lack of action by previous regimes in terms of exports, by, say, buying a pipeline?
2136 2018-10-22 19:52:55 Now for the house of Saud, it wouldn’t that hard to at least break their kingdom in 2. All we have to do is arm the Shiites inside the kingdom. The Shiites sit on the bulk of the oil reserves.
2137 2018-10-22 19:52:42 Where does @andrewscheercpc @CPC_HQ stand on Canada's reliance on foreign oil? I'm sure Eastern Canada like Western Canada would love to know where his allegiance lies? Anybody know what he's sad and where he said it?

2146 2018-10-22 19:51:35 What tipping point? Nothing has tipped! The Cdn & Swedish govts seem to have been effectively cowed, neither is leading the charge on #Khashoggi. Now Trump is paving the way for the MBS cover up. Where's the talk of sanction? Where's the talk of an oil embargo?

2149 2018-10-22 19:50:54 They can’t use it, the notion that SA is a rich country is false,just compare its economy with any midsize European one, but the diferente that they got easy money and the spend it as new rich,any attempt to cut oil will fireback on them and the king will be removed in 2 weeks

2172 2018-10-22 19:48:31 is it worth it to the American people to punish Saudis, then have oil spike to five bucks a gallon when they retaliate?
2173 2018-10-22 19:48:16 Abe sun muslim desho ki aukaat sun le america ne tum sbki chaddi faad di h

2174 2018-10-22 19:48:14 I'm old enough to have gone through the Cold War. Look at Venezuela today. Took over the Evil Oil Company Factories for the poor. Now they are all Poor. Says History.
2175 2018-10-22 19:48:07 WCS is cheap because it in extremely expensive to transport and we have to sell at a discount to united states, if we refined our own oil we would have to import 0 Saudi oil and would benefit from royalties and income taxes from industries
2176 2018-10-22 19:47:55 dude I swear peppermint and lemon mixed with any spruce oil will change your life
2177 2018-10-22 19:47:37 Forest 78 beat the lot of em ..went over 12 calendar months without being beaten .. not to mention winning big ears the next season and defended it the year after and in knockout .. no seeded leagues .. and no arab oil money either

2179 2018-10-22 19:47:25 Getting an oil change so annoying I been here for an hour already. Bitch chop chop
2180 2018-10-22 19:47:24 Erm yes!! You could turn the excess into garlic oil 
2181 2018-10-22 19:47:24 too much oil for my head like say I be egg sauce 
2182 2018-10-22 19:47:20 It has actual nutritional value and isn’t deep fried or cooked in a ton of oil lol
2183 2018-10-22 19:47:17 Yeah but Vermont is beautiful and has tourism and doesn't rely on oil for an economy.
2184 2018-10-22 19:47:11 Yup on the olive oil. I take that straight off the spoon (x3) twice a day. There's nothing better for you.
2185 2018-10-22 19:47:01 Texas, the land of J.R. Ewing, big cattle & big oil, is going to elect some guy named “Beto?”

Doubt it.
2186 2018-10-22 19:46:59 Don't buy his snake oil. Come to me... I sell viper poison for all the mental illnesses.
2187 2018-10-22 19:46:59 oil mais quel joueur 
2188 2018-10-22 19:46:42 I miss getting oil changes at home, it’s $10 cheaper there 
2189 2018-10-22 19:46:37 I've a new blog post ready for tomorrow, it will be another group of fragrance free products, perfect for all my sensitive followers who need to avoid essential oil allergens #linaloolhatesme

I still pine over mine I sold a while agodang!
2192 2018-10-22 19:46:27 The oil is fine Wewe ni camera was too fine for the object
2193 2018-10-22 19:46:26 Why don't we takeover one of thos countries Americanize it then the people can go there! And take their oil to fund it!
2194 2018-10-22 19:46:26 
Oil, Water, Whisky other Resources are being STOLEN by English Westminster you silly person. 
Getting out of the Disunited Kingdom!
2195 2018-10-22 19:46:16 Should of gone to war with Saudi Arabia instead of iraq and Afghanistan. We could of got all their oil. Oh well
2196 2018-10-22 19:46:11 The relationship has been like this for 70 plus years.  Time for a course correction, maybe--now that US is "self-sufficient" in oil, which we have to stop using anyway?
2197 2018-10-22 19:46:08 I'm not going 2 go into why murder is fkd up, bc it is. But to condemn an entire race/culture for it is a knee jerk reaction. Western Culture destroyed the Middle East & we have a responsibility to help them. If you don't like it, don't vote for people who want 2 go 2 war for oil
2198 2018-10-22 19:46:06 ... that won't hurt anything, right? Gum up the whatsis with chocolate frosting? Kill passing birds with burning coconut oil?

Amazing Herbs out of GA is very high quality Black Seed Oil, dosage important check instructions 1 tsp held under tongue for minute 30 minutes before any food in am, swallow, wash down then 1 tsp at night, Amazing oil.
2203 2018-10-22 19:45:33 I distrust climate science because of the many times NOAA and NASA have both been caught fudging their data, not to mention smaller organizations and independent researchers.
As for Big Oil—I trust them implicitly. 
2204 2018-10-22 19:45:28 You are aware that Canada is a net exporter of oil, no? And that it is refining companies, not Canada, that buys Saudi oil? Oil sands product is cheap BECAUSE THERE IS A GLUT OF OIL and nothing to do with oil imports from the middle east.

2207 2018-10-22 19:45:07 America relies on Saudi Arabia to gain access to Middle Eastern oil. It's been that way since the 70's. If the relationship between the Saudis and the U.S breaks down, so does the American economy. It's as simple as that.
2208 2018-10-22 19:45:04 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
2209 2018-10-22 19:45:04 When I add olive oil, rosemary, parsley, garlic, cayenne pepper, and black pepper to my quinoa, it’s the best thing ever. Simple af and so good.
2210 2018-10-22 19:45:04 The excess oil on the body that wasn't removed while bathing
2211 2018-10-22 19:45:00 iknow. I had bladder cancer and what it took to get me better. including  radical cyctectomy. (look it up) followed by Chemo. All if which allow me to live, not juicing and snake oil, oops, fish oil supplements.
2212 2018-10-22 19:44:58 Oil prices end barely higher as traders monitor U.S.-Saudi tensions
2213 2018-10-22 19:44:38 I have never used Splenda in a recipe. I usually like to use alternatives to traditional sugars like agave syrup or coconut oil. #SPLENDAcrowd #sponsored
2214 2018-10-22 19:44:27 Not to the people but to the governments so they allow the eviction of the farmers so our corporations can plant palm oil! Get informed!

2216 2018-10-22 19:44:15 As Canada has oil, plus Canadians own a pipeline, the best way to punish the Saudis is to stop buying their oil.  Not hurt 2000 workers and their families in Ontario  by putting them out of work.
2217 2018-10-22 19:44:05 trucks backed up to Wales? petrol stations out of petrol? nobody to call when the toilet clogs up? left in our water-damaged homes with no heating oil and no aspirin? I’m just calling out a nasty article & the old patriotic Labour Party would be affronted by some of it.
2218 2018-10-22 19:44:01 Why don't we takeover one of thos countries Americanize it then the people can go there! And take their oil to fund it!

2220 2018-10-22 19:43:26 Initiative Q is even more blatantly a Ponzi / Pyramid scheme than Bitcoin, and that's saying a bunch. Don't be sucked in by the snake oil salesmen.

2226 2018-10-22 19:42:45 I stopped reading when I saw that you parroted the gibberish about oil going to a "single customer".
2227 2018-10-22 19:42:42 When regional carriers like Air Carnival, Air Costa & Air Pegasus suspended their operations and in the rising oil prices I was wondering if #TruJet had that much funding for #JetAirways ATR aircraft.
2228 2018-10-22 19:42:36 So true. Oil money please move over the aircon community is making it rain!!! 
2229 2018-10-22 19:42:31 I’m so happy I’m finally getting my oil changed
2230 2018-10-22 19:42:20 Most of that oil would get shipped to the gulf. We wouldn’t refine it and use it here.
2231 2018-10-22 19:42:11 Tomato sauce, garlic sauce, olive oil, lemon sauce, butter sauce, marinaded and many more.

2234 2018-10-22 19:41:47 What I asked for was a oil change. BITCH don’t call me a hr later telling me what else I need & it’s only gonna be ($713)
2235 2018-10-22 19:41:44 I've been having this tingling sensation in my healing wounds on my leg. I applied coconut oil and shea butter. Works like magic.
2236 2018-10-22 19:41:40 If SaudiArabia keeps alienating itself like this much longer, Khashoggi’s murder might become the catalyst for a Western sustainable energy transformation real fast. #oil
2237 2018-10-22 19:41:39 The end game is Hydrogen Fuel Cell. Check out the Hyundai Nexo. The tech is already out there. Just need the oil companies to get on board 
2238 2018-10-22 19:41:38    Where's your anointing oil Deacon @dawncuzo
2239 2018-10-22 19:41:36 It's all in the family. Keep your nose out of it and pay attention to your own business.
2240 2018-10-22 19:41:26 Westerners: "I am saving the planet, my shoes were made from 25% recycled plastic in China (75% remains dumped in waterways). A ship burned 12 thousand gallons of oil to bring me these shoes"
2241 2018-10-22 19:41:24 Oil & natural gas, lifting billions out of poverty and contributing to a cleaner environment!
2242 2018-10-22 19:41:24 Also, vocal "support" from an east coast socialist/environmentalist via Warren wouldn't bode well as support in an ND oil driven economy.
& Not to be a Warren apologist but if she's motivated by standing up to a bully after continued blatant ignorance, what time is a good time?
2243 2018-10-22 19:41:21 @realDonaldTrump Falih remembered about oil embargo that means that they take on account this move, they haven't another solution to answer to sanctions.
2244 2018-10-22 19:41:12 You see the problem with your logic right? You’re saying we have to completely get off oil or we’re done, but there’s no way the world is going to be able to do that. It’s impossible. We literally need oil to survive.
2245 2018-10-22 19:40:51 Бля вообще жиза, ещё и орёшь потом с того какой же ты тупой, но блин смешно же
2246 2018-10-22 19:40:32 See, i wanna try that castor oil for my hair and brows. I heard it works hella good.
2247 2018-10-22 19:40:29 Oil did not even cover free prescriptions

 UK North Sea revenue was £1.2 billion in 2017-18

 cost of providing prescriptions has gone up by 25% in the last decade, with an ageing population and new drugs part of the reason

NHS figures show the total bill for 2017-18 was £1.3bn
2248 2018-10-22 19:40:29 Thanks to all the PS4 blackout wager kids for paying for my oil change.
2249 2018-10-22 19:40:19 Either you still don't now how any of this works, or you're just selling more snake oil to your rabid followers. Possibly both.
2250 2018-10-22 19:40:11 The price of oil will skyrocket, @realDonaldTrump keeps costing Americans money.
2251 2018-10-22 19:40:10 ん、これ油変えた？あーなるほど、ごま油をひまわり油で割ったのか。
2252 2018-10-22 19:40:04 Family Nutrition: Frito Lay's #Cheetos this October? Its top three ingredients are corn meal, vegetable oil and cheese seasoning.
2253 2018-10-22 19:40:02 A conversation with industry leaders regarding changing their infrastructures immediately is necessary.  For example, in oil can be distilled imagine ocean water
2254 2018-10-22 19:39:55 До меня тоже не сразу дошло. За это я и люблю такие приколы. Ибо ты, когда до тебя доходит, начинаешь просто орать вдвойне: с прикола и с того, что до тебя не доходило это ТАК долго.
2255 2018-10-22 19:39:54 It's time for a nationwide strike in all sectors in Iran, especially the oil industry, against the despicable regime which harasses, intimidates & murders the people in the country. It's also time for the EU  and all other commercial partners to stop funding the Iranian regime.
2256 2018-10-22 19:39:51 On a positive note: bad press is good press... on the assumption it worked out for potus. 
But when you think about it GM Honda Audi are releasing thier EV lineups soon. Keeping Tesla's achievements quiet only makes sense for these seasoned oil companies. 1/
2257 2018-10-22 19:39:46 It’s bad for the oil
2258 2018-10-22 19:39:17 Aren't all journalists like Bronson, where they get nekkid and oil up before a fight?
2259 2018-10-22 19:39:13 So we are stopping shipments of Saudi oil to Canada then?
2260 2018-10-22 19:39:04 Akwai armoury  my Arsenal is loaded

2262 2018-10-22 19:38:56 remember been sent to the pharmist to buy olive oil
2263 2018-10-22 19:38:49 Also oil is organic and gluten free so it’s not even polluting. Your so embarrassing Jeffery
2264 2018-10-22 19:38:49 Of course! Being an adult is all about headaches. Cars need oil changes and gas and maintenance. Houses come with bills and yard work. Jobs consume your days and suck your soul dry. Can I just go hide under a blanket in my bedroom and eat chocolate chip cookies now?
2265 2018-10-22 19:38:49 I suspect is we checked properly, we wouldn't be eating anything, even stuff you would never imagine could possibly contain palm oil does indeed contain palm oil. Why can't we find a more earth friendly alternative?
2266 2018-10-22 19:38:31 Some brands saying they are signed up to the commitment to do better are pushing back deadlines and not sharing info to consumers clearly enough. We need clear info. It wld be better 2 not use palm oil @ all. Even WWF & Greenpeace are getting conflicting info from companies!
2267 2018-10-22 19:38:21 The price of oil is going up, or US sanctions on Iran will collapse.
2268 2018-10-22 19:38:19 NOTE:  
   convert just 20% of cars( to battery powered) used daily, and that will filter out the annoying "summer/seasonal spikes" in gas prices ( & saudi power)

The conversion can be done within 4 yrs....helps prevent more recessions like 1973, 1979  (opec raised oil $ )
2269 2018-10-22 19:38:14 I started to give my boy salmon oil on his food. It's made his coat super shiny and soft. A good brush daily as well.
2270 2018-10-22 19:38:09 No  I’m dying laughing cuz he said “so when was your last oil change ...when you bought the car “ 
2271 2018-10-22 19:38:07 If Climate Change is hoax and Journalists are the enemy of the people , let the oil flow and the high tech weapons fly " It's all good"
2272 2018-10-22 19:37:56 So it has been a 2.5 hours since I took my cbd oil dose. The pain level has gone down a lot but I still have a little pain
2273 2018-10-22 19:37:45 Trump/Putin is a snake oil salesman, The Donald says literally anything to  & totally disregards truth/reality  
2274 2018-10-22 19:37:44 Wtf Jeff. If you plug the hole you can’t get oil #idiot
2275 2018-10-22 19:37:41 Дошло, но в начале как-то не так как надо(очень не так) проорала конечно, а потом дошло по нормальному да вот такой вот я тугодумный
2276 2018-10-22 19:37:26 Yes and who they sell oil to as wang to@know if my car is using their petrol!

2280 2018-10-22 19:36:59 We were never going to be able to use tarsands oil. It's too expensive to refine.
2281 2018-10-22 19:36:43 Did you vote yes on Anwar? Why do we have to keep buying their oil? We make our own, keep the $$$, & Saudis have none to give to terrorists
2282 2018-10-22 19:36:37 OPEC must remain only for oil producer's countries ,any other intruders should be an observer
2283 2018-10-22 19:36:33 Oil is above all considerations.
2284 2018-10-22 19:36:15 It’s taken this long because no one wants to lose Saudi oil.
Honestly I’m more surprised that one Journalist’s murder is causing this much outrage and pressure to be put on Saudi Arabia.
2285 2018-10-22 19:35:59 But what body oil/highlight is this? I want it
2286 2018-10-22 19:35:58 @terencecorcoran can you check your inbox for a bullshit rebuttal from the coal, oil and gas industry?

2289 2018-10-22 19:35:34 They spent generations with social upheaval to maintain oil intetest , funding drugs cartels to fund wars etc. literally fucked these people over and they want safe haven. Cant blame them.
2290 2018-10-22 19:35:31 #TraitorTot , didn't you and Eric brag about how much business you do with the Russians? Where would you prefer European countries get oil/gas from, the Saudi's? By the way, what percentage of their petroleum needs come from Russia? #TrumpRussianPuppets
2291 2018-10-22 19:35:30 Oil and Mhki playing together is not effective
2292 2018-10-22 19:35:24 Oil and gas and wind and solar and tidal, we already produce more than enough.
Norway with smaller fields than Scotland has have a wealth fund of £1trillion, UK has a debt of £1.45trillion.
Whatever the oil/gas revenues it is better for a pop of 5M over 65M.
2293 2018-10-22 19:35:21 Every1 said same thing about Yam last yr but look at how 1 more yr of JR has helped him,same for LD. Plus,Oil saved 1yr on his ELC & a UFA yr by sending KY back,same will apply to EB going back. Also,Seattle ED coming,sending EB back to JR now will automatically protect him in ED
2294 2018-10-22 19:35:18 Except they do report on valid and vital stories every day. That you choose to ignore them and believe the rhetoric of a morally bankrupt snake oil salesman is on you.

2298 2018-10-22 19:34:53 no matter who controls the Saudi oil fields, they will want to pump the oil and sell it (see the ISIS oil fields where we were actually trying to STOP THEM from selling oil). All of these things mean much less leverage for the Saudi government.

2307 2018-10-22 19:33:36 Aww wee soul. It's so awful to see when they can't help themselves. A little bowl of water with olbas oil in it under the radiator (if it's on) will help her at night.
2308 2018-10-22 19:33:36 Every single time a solution is proposed, the Out-of-state Oil corporations say it won't work. They wouldn't spend $26 million against #YesOn1631 if it wasn't going to work. They're terrified Washingtonians will get off of oil and fracked gas and on to clean energy. @OPBTOL

2310 2018-10-22 19:33:33 Oil and dead skin and mites, OH MY!!
(a la Wizard of Oz)
2311 2018-10-22 19:33:27 Please can you send me your contact address,  e-mail or phone contact to discuss buissines with you.  I have been longing to go into palm oil production. 
Good evening.

my WhatsApp is 08108923830
2312 2018-10-22 19:33:26 By eliminating one or two oil companies, there will be much less fossil fuel on the market, and constructive consumption will be the only option. Also, rationing could prevent the rich from hoarding fossil fuel as it gets more scarce.
2313 2018-10-22 19:33:20 I've seen an oil tanker run faster than Bellerin.
2314 2018-10-22 19:33:19 I don't often disagree with Tyler, but this is one. It seems that you miss three points: one, oil is a worldwide market and therefore deliveries to anyone indirectly benefit America; two, the Saudis need to pump oil as badly as the world needs them to pump it; and three,
2315 2018-10-22 19:33:19 You’re joking, I actually had to stop my car and pay for a some, get help from 2 people to open my car for me and actually check the dipstick, to see absolutely 0 engine oil and I’ve been driving Leeds - Nottingham
2316 2018-10-22 19:33:09 After an oil change the girl at jiffy lube held the car door open for me and closed the door for me when I got in,I feel like a damn girl I don’t like it 
2317 2018-10-22 19:33:08 You know that Dawn dish soap commercial where they’re cleaning the ducks after the oil spill? It’s a shame, because between the salt water and the oil, they were just a hot skillet away from some good eatin’.
2318 2018-10-22 19:33:03 And no doubt spend billions with his mate Putin importing his blood soaked gas and oil!
2319 2018-10-22 19:33:02 I need to get my oil changed but i neither want to leave my house nor pay for it.
2320 2018-10-22 19:32:49 From economic, efficiency, and enviromental point, fracking (method for extracting oil or natural gas) does not make sense.
2321 2018-10-22 19:32:40 Quick to dose out pharma meds, which cause so many issues. People are waking up. they won't hold back the tide. YOU KNOW WHATS RIGHT FOR YOU. i mean, black seed oil, a super, super healer, why's that not a banned subtance.. I'TS A WAR  ON HUMANITY
2322 2018-10-22 19:32:35 Check your oil level
2323 2018-10-22 19:32:32 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.
2324 2018-10-22 19:32:22 As a shareholder in the pipeline you must be happy that it’s now easier to export our oil, soon Canada will be raking in the royalties
2325 2018-10-22 19:31:50 I’m 24 years old and my snacks consist of cheese sticks and bread dipped in olive oil, balsamic and Parmesan cheese.

2329 2018-10-22 19:30:57 @McVities Hi. Where is the palm oil sourced from for your biscuits?
2330 2018-10-22 19:30:48 Sorry for your loss. The argument is on both sides. Have a friend who's uncle had throat cancer and tried all the treatments.  Asked his doctor about CBD oil. Doctor said knock your self out. He did, and it eradicate the disease. I'll say it  again, he's cured.
2331 2018-10-22 19:30:48 Ain’t got a monthly payment and I just ran that bitch with no oil an it didn’t lock up . Do that with any other car you’re seizing that engine up real quick

2334 2018-10-22 19:30:32 Oil company spokesperson is full-on lying about how WA's ballot measure to put a fee on pollution and fund clean energy for consumers and businesses. It will cover 80% of the greenhouse gases put out in Washington. @OPBTOL

2340 2018-10-22 19:28:51 I think it would be safer to vape on an offshore oil rig than to light up a stogie. Vote YES.
2341 2018-10-22 19:28:39 Sure, then buy from Venezuela until we can get off oil.

2345 2018-10-22 19:28:36 I just got an oil change but I have attachment issues
2346 2018-10-22 19:28:21 2. NA, particularly the US, already has the most robust food supply between land and oil reserves. If these places get more land to support crops, still have the issue of who among the billions to feed/let inside.
2347 2018-10-22 19:28:18 Lt. Dan is just a snake oil salesman.  Voting for Mike when I get to the polls later this week!
2348 2018-10-22 19:28:16 You mean the root causes of oil millionaires getting shot.

2353 2018-10-22 19:27:31 These journalists need to get over the fact that no one - not even the President - is obligated to worship them.

Oh, and they were hated and resented by the majority of the public long before 2016.
2354 2018-10-22 19:27:24 Oh nice, let me hear from the conspiranoics in CT how it is that my country became the hot mess it currently is. Then hear them blame the only paying customer for Venezuelan oil. I would waste my time trying to explain how wrong and stupid your post is, but I want to avoid it.
2355 2018-10-22 19:27:19 Yup, Money and oil.
2356 2018-10-22 19:27:18 Since probably 80% of the world's businesses benefit somehow from Saudi oil, this should be an amusing display of stupidity.  
2357 2018-10-22 19:27:17 Lavender oil + sea salt
2358 2018-10-22 19:27:08 Senator the only way to stabilize southern hemisphere ;and stop migration problems ;and put SAUDI ARABIA IN IT'S PLACE !IS FIX SECOND LARGEST OIL RESERVE'S INFRASTRUCTURE ;VENEZUELA! IT WILL PICK UP WORLD CRITERIA AND STOP WAR IN YEMEN!
2359 2018-10-22 19:27:03 I want to get rid of pipelines AND avoid buying oil from murderous regimes like KSA.
2360 2018-10-22 19:26:57 MSM, supported by Turkey, Iran and Qatar, want to put POTUS in a difficult situation. If he sanctions Saudi, the economy will get bad and oil crisis will rise.
If he does not, they will spend years on bashing him how the Saudis paid him off and he is a traitor.

2364 2018-10-22 19:26:22 That sorrel mare is the one with rainrot that never got treatment.She was the first to”disappear”.He kept saying she was”mean”.Thats why he wouldn’t shell out $40 for a gallon of tea tree oil to get rid of it!
2365 2018-10-22 19:26:17 SNP were FORMED for Scottish independence. Doesn't take a genius.When can we see the oil revenue docs? The spying on Scots docs?The Scotland subsidising the uk docs? The protected 'Scotland referendum' docs? The 'misplaced' MaggieMay paedophile docs? You can see ours right after!
2366 2018-10-22 19:26:16 Wow, you brought a whole case of that snake oil.
2367 2018-10-22 19:26:10 The Jamal Khashoggi incident and its fallout confirms what’s been apparent for years now: Saudi Arabia is not so much of an oil power as a financial one.
2368 2018-10-22 19:26:10 Empty political promises. If it wasn't so expensive it would be funny. Snake oil sellers the lot of them.
2369 2018-10-22 19:26:10 Germany's investment in oil and gas from Russia is a bad idea. I was against it in the 80's under #HelmutKohl and I haven't changed my opinion now. It is nothing to do with #Trump. It's a bad idea to be dependant on an adversary and basta!
2370 2018-10-22 19:26:05 Previous sanctions by the UN, US, EU seriously affected Iran’s economy, costing them over $160B in oil revenue from 2012-2016.  We did NOT give them 1.8B. The Nuclear Deal gave them back $100B in frozen assets” (their money!)
2371 2018-10-22 19:26:04 I thought you knew bro lol I stay with a good body oil
2372 2018-10-22 19:25:40 Just as law is only a sample of moral guidelines, climate science is only the facts. Bike commuting is inspired by Greenpeace as well as Peter Calmus. “Small is beautiful” and “keep it in the ground” both mean the same thing: disband an oil company.
2373 2018-10-22 19:25:37 The railroad commissioner in Texas is in charge of oil and gas grants divvied up as well as policies regarding public land sales/divestment. The incumbent (R) has been commissioner since 2012. The Democrat cand. wants protection for land and regulations on oil & gas.
2374 2018-10-22 19:25:34 Build a mote on the outside of the wall and fill it with oil and water. They can’t get through that and if they do they will be too slippery to climb tbe wall. Or deputize ordinary Americans. They will line the borders and stop them! They need to go home!   #StopTheCaravan

2376 2018-10-22 19:25:15 The first clear credible emergence directly from the Sauds that if it allies like the USA become punitive to them it will use oil as leverage .In other words blackmail them to shut up! Is this also why the Trump clan is so obscenely grovelling towards Saudi Arabia?
2377 2018-10-22 19:25:05 Olive oil based salad dressings are trash.
2378 2018-10-22 19:25:00 I agree: “Let’s talk about what’s happening in the Gulf before we move into the Atlantic.” A hurricane lead to 14 yrs of 80+ gallons of oil leaks per day — plus silence? That’s not an excellent set up for: okay, let’s do more of that in my front yard. Hurricanes are stronger now.
2379 2018-10-22 19:24:55 Also things like standard oil In the 1860s the process for refining was inefficient and resulted in products of inconsistent quality. As a result, the refining process was expensive, wasteful, and produced low yields. They also put out business to compete with them
2380 2018-10-22 19:24:49 What do I not understand that after all these years people in educated countries still follow these snake oil salesmen? What am I missing about their psyche that they believe them to be arbitrators of truth?
2381 2018-10-22 19:24:45 Snake oil does the trick
2382 2018-10-22 19:24:43 Dave Miller is being fair to both guests, but I'm happy to see him calling BS on the Oil corporations misleading talking points. Good journalism in the age of Trump requires calling out lies for what they are. @OPBTOL @DaveMillerOPB #YesOn1631

2384 2018-10-22 19:24:35 Have to investigate more before I can say anything intelligent. However, basic problem remains:

1. modern crops deplete the soil and must be fed by oil-derived fertilizers. When oil becomes more expensive, so does food. The areas most impacted are Africa & Indian subcontinent
2385 2018-10-22 19:24:32 Me:

Mechanic: ok so we changed your oil, and it looks like you need a tire rotation, a new timing belt and a new compressor

Me: my nigga, I do not give a fuck about your recommendations. I came in here for an oil change and that’s what the fuck I got. 
2386 2018-10-22 19:24:23 They need to. At the very least it should be medically available and the oil with low THC should be legal everywhere.

One day Russia or China will pull in the US national debt.

2389 2018-10-22 19:24:11 So #skripal event in UK and not much evidence if any but steps are taken against Russia  
Then #Khashoggi and various evidence exist—> no steps are taken against Saudi Arabia  
So.. has it something to do with 1/4 of global crude oil is in Saudi ?
#Hypocrites  big time
2390 2018-10-22 19:24:06 And many cases of asthma are caused by the pollution from COAL plants, oil & gas refineries, factories, and major polluting corporations that Donald Trump supports!
2391 2018-10-22 19:23:26 I have a question. Why do the liberals talk tough on Twitter when it comes to SA but won't stop importing their oil or selling them equipment?
2392 2018-10-22 19:23:12  Bro that nigga dip his hands in butter and oil before every game, I’m just mad they gone release him, they need to make him sit on the bench

2394 2018-10-22 19:23:03 Naw...I don’t hide and most of us don’t polish guns. We clean and oil them. We don’t have sidewalks, we have a lakes.  These peasants aren’t (that means “are not”, a contraction) Immigrates, their illegal.

2401 2018-10-22 19:22:23 The problem with that is tar oil is dirtier than Saudi oil.
Somebody tried that decades ago and Alberta and the cons blocked it.
And how big of a refinery do you want to build? Replace current demand or future demand?
2402 2018-10-22 19:22:19 Looked like basically ground-up cookies, canola oil and sugar.
2403 2018-10-22 19:22:18 Saudi Arabia has been manipulating and financing every terrorist faction to control the middle east and influence every country in the world. Oil is the source of their currency and why world leaders have been so intent on alternative fuels.
2404 2018-10-22 19:22:06 I actually use Pam instead of oil to sauté, so it’s zero!
2405 2018-10-22 19:22:00 Don’t do it. My Vauxhall engine broke down after just 53,000 miles in 5 years. Too much engine oil, 3 days after my engine oil was changed by Vauxhall. They deny responsibility.

2409 2018-10-22 19:21:34 Look at what's in the territory rather than the territory itself. Idlib has the most powerful opposition groups. Turkey and SDF have the arable land and the biggest oil fields. Assad is really poor atm because he doesn't have control over most of Syria's resources.

- climate change denyers
- corruption of policy

2413 2018-10-22 19:21:13 I can see it doubling pre spud. Could go up maybe over 0.30p on spud etc. If they strike oil all bets are off, should hit 0.50-1p Depends on the size of the strike etc. #UJO

2415 2018-10-22 19:21:05 Do you understand the term “background radiation”?

Any nitrogen found in a fossil, a diamond, petroleum gas, coal, oil or any mineral can be converted to c14 by the presence of radioactivity from unstable atoms. 

This is common knowledge to educated scientists.
2416 2018-10-22 19:21:00 Solar power, wind power, electric cars, organic derivates, nanotech...all we can discover against oil is good. God bless us all that we are going that way
2417 2018-10-22 19:20:52 You have no chance. If by chance dimms do take House, by 2020 Trump will be assured another 4 yrs as  people will be so fed up.
2418 2018-10-22 19:20:51 Even with oil at $150 it only brings in a revenue of £10bn And let's face it Norway will jump at the chance to sell England more.
The City of London will become a foreign banking location and your largest banks will all move south. In short you'll make Greece look fiscally sound.

2420 2018-10-22 19:20:42 They won't. If oil prices get lower, they have to dip into their reserves... They won't do that just to say thank you.
2421 2018-10-22 19:20:38 Uhh yeah!  He works in the oil and gas industry, which was depressed during Obama and took off under Trump.  As did most things.
2422 2018-10-22 19:20:29 Oh yeah, we know and have no trouble admitting it.

You have destroyed countries for oil telling the world lies to get its backing. More than once.

2435 2018-10-22 19:19:14 Calculation doesn’t take account of loss to rUK of oil and gas revenues
2436 2018-10-22 19:19:04 use oil blotting sheets like halfway thru the day
2437 2018-10-22 19:18:59 全ての料理はオイルなしに作れない…(作れるのもあるかも、え、あるのかなぁ)
2438 2018-10-22 19:18:58 Fixed my computer fan with olive oil today. How are you doing?
2439 2018-10-22 19:18:42 This Bandh is not about some silly agenda. It practically concerns the very citizens that may have to make do without a day’s wage today. 
it’s not about oil prices, st quotas, or about dams. 
Our identity is at stake and the Govt (previous as well) is trading it for votes.
2440 2018-10-22 19:18:34 Like..... the “Double” didn’t even have the same head of hair. This is REALLY bad for S.A. Seems they think their oil riches will absolve them of crimes like this.
2441 2018-10-22 19:18:24 Don't put your future in oil, alternative energy is the future.
2442 2018-10-22 19:18:22 Everything so boring when she goes to sleep
2443 2018-10-22 19:18:20 The technology is new and applicable only when it's clear to every user how the specific implementation works. @DouglasDaniel is right. It lends nothing to voting with this app. It's snake oil.
2444 2018-10-22 19:18:09 I appreciate that the mechanics check all the stuff in my car because I probably look clueless and like I need their help but if I come in asking for an oil change know I've probably but it off for as long as possible because i can barely afford this. Sorry homie. No new filters.
2445 2018-10-22 19:18:07 Oil or spunk?
2446 2018-10-22 19:17:48 Serán de gas,-oil, y para cuando SANCHEZ LA EQUIPARACION SALARIAL para la FOP, no hay dinero para los q nos defienden y para su gobierno si hay, esperemos q se hundan en la miseria próximas elecciones  salga VOX
2447 2018-10-22 19:17:46 Along with Winters Remedy, I’ll be launching a super moisturizing body butter and body oil to help protect the skin during harsh weather conditions
2448 2018-10-22 19:17:40 Have you transitioned to oil pastels at conferences?
2449 2018-10-22 19:17:39 They have oil?
2450 2018-10-22 19:17:36 Think I’m gonna have to make a surviving part 2 playlist. Songs so far: plea from a cat named virtute, crying at the Wawa, take a breath by raffi, maybe coconut oil by lizzo
2451 2018-10-22 19:17:36 Where can I buy that extra anti-virgin olive oil
2452 2018-10-22 19:17:31 People who put olive oil on avocado need to be monitored.
2453 2018-10-22 19:17:26 MY PEOPLE THE BROCCOLI LOVERS.
I like to sauté it a bit in a wok so it's a bit softer and develops its nutty flavor. Just a smidge of olive oil and then a bit of salt and THE BROCC TRAIN GOES IN MAH BELLY
2454 2018-10-22 19:17:26 Wife reading fb post from her friend: 
"Does anyone use homeopathy? My little boy got into my essential oils and has oil burns all over him."
Me: "Tell her to turn on her fawcett, homeopathy is just water."
Wife: "Oh no, you have to read the comments, they are hilarious."
2455 2018-10-22 19:17:24 everytime I introduce food to hot cooking oil, the oil always tries to escape the pot making aggressive bubbles.
2456 2018-10-22 19:17:12 My dad swears I don’t know how to check the oil or how to put air in a tire  hb taught me a lot
2457 2018-10-22 19:17:05 He bought the pub restaurant we run 30 years ago.
He made the money to do it working in computers though.
He worked in Saudi Arabia for a big oil company for 5 years back in the ‘80’s.

2462 2018-10-22 19:16:37 My daddy did my breaks in my car & filled up my gas tank & changed my oil/wiper blades for me. If you ever wonder why i won’t settle for any less than being treated like a princess it’s because I was shown that that’s what I deserve my entire life

2464 2018-10-22 19:16:26 Amen. Our goal to be involved in any war where lives are lost should be FREEDOM to uphold our principles & those allies we’ve promised to protect (have each other’s back). No more protecting “$$ assets” like oil when we’re capable of using our own or buying more from Canada.
2465 2018-10-22 19:16:11 One Nigeria is because of the oil in Biafra land,,if the oil was in the north Nigeria,no one Nigeria
2466 2018-10-22 19:16:11 The last 70 years have been about nothing but mideast oil profits. :(
2467 2018-10-22 19:16:06 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
2468 2018-10-22 19:16:05 If they try and force this I think we should stop paying transfer payments; stop shipping oil east; and finally start the process for separation from eastern Canada. @JustinTrudeau has no clue about Western Canada and their needs.
2469 2018-10-22 19:16:00 Oil and gas was cheaper under @BarackObama.
2470 2018-10-22 19:15:47 Blend 2 1/2 pints eggrolls with 4 cups enchilada. Mix into  Olive Oil. Freeze for 9 hours. Serve on bread
2471 2018-10-22 19:15:46 First of all we don’t have any proof he knew.  Second Erdogan, Putin, & Chinese have done far worse.  Yet we deal w them all the time.  So why would we treat an ally worse than our enemies & risk $200 oil?  Come up w a solution in which Saudis pay a price & never do this again.
2472 2018-10-22 19:15:43 If the entire country could / would use Canadian oil there would be no need for a ban.  period.
#pipelines
2473 2018-10-22 19:15:34 i've been oil painting all day so my skin is like. soaked in oil and now my hot water isn't working hahaha kill me
2474 2018-10-22 19:15:33 Means nothing. They won't cancel the Armored Vehicles contract because they'll lose seats in Ontario. Trudeau & she can't stop importation of 80 K barrels of oil a day Down East because he screwed the Canada East pipeline to save seats in Quebec.
#CBCFakeNews for the Low-Infos

2475 2018-10-22 19:15:29 You forgot to add cost of crude oil
2476 2018-10-22 19:15:27 Shouldn't be a problem here! Shake the bottle well, then hold 8-12 inches away before spraying your hair section by section. Especially aim towards the roots, where hair is most oily. Then massage through roots to absorb oil, and brush through hair to finish.
2477 2018-10-22 19:15:27 I blended virgin olive oil 
Coconut 
Aloe Vera 
Honey
And avocado together and put it in my hair 
My hair feels and smell so good
2478 2018-10-22 19:15:20 Yeah, who needs oil!! Oh wait, everyone needs oil! From 99% of the vehicles, including public transportation as well as all industry machines!
2479 2018-10-22 19:15:18 I bought some chicken and just realized we don’t have any oil 
2480 2018-10-22 19:15:12 How old were you when you realised that oando  is just an acronym......... It is "O" and"O" meaning ocean and oil.
2481 2018-10-22 19:14:51 We will also launch our super moisturizing Body Butter and body oil that will help protect dry and cracked skin especially during the harsh winter season
2482 2018-10-22 19:14:48 @KelloggsUK @KelloggsUS I’m not militant just a normal person with morals. I won’t buy products that use palm oil - there’s no excuse and RSPO is a greenwash. My family and I will not be buying your products until you find an alternative.
2483 2018-10-22 19:14:39 He's peddaling.. his snake oil!!
2484 2018-10-22 19:14:34 I hate when u go get ur oil changed & they come in the building to try and sell u on some more ish ur car "needs"....i send they ass right back out! #foh

2486 2018-10-22 19:14:22 Do you cook rice with oil?
2487 2018-10-22 19:14:09 I just called getting a hair cut AND my cars oil changed splurging. Welcome to adulthood.
2488 2018-10-22 19:14:07 @danielvankirk New hire safety package at my new job, and I think it's a Greenly. "Slips usually happen when there is a loss of grip between an individual’s footwear and the floor. This commonly occurs when there is water, or oil on the floor, typically around kitchen areas."
2489 2018-10-22 19:14:05 Idk who’s daughter needs to hear this but get an oil change baby girl
2490 2018-10-22 19:14:04 I’ll love @DearRanda for life for putting me on black castor oil 
2491 2018-10-22 19:13:58 Always wear gloves when handling any chemicals as cleaners are designed to remove oil and grease as well as the natural oils in your skin.
2492 2018-10-22 19:13:50 WTI Crude Oil +0.1% at 69.42 bbl $USO
Gold -0.3% to 1224.60 oz $GLD
Copper +0.4% to 2.79 lb $CU
2493 2018-10-22 19:13:39 They built them to process heavy oil from Venezuela. Supply dried up, now trying to cut losses. Got Alberta suppliers right where they want them. As long as we keep taps open, they'll continue to gouge.
2494 2018-10-22 19:13:37 working on a series of 6 oil paintings on masonite panels
2495 2018-10-22 19:13:31 i think over the winter i might focus on oil pastel work 
2496 2018-10-22 19:13:16 Get some black jamaican castor oil for growth, that shit is the truth. Tropic isle living brand, just rub it in like every other day.
2497 2018-10-22 19:13:16 Oregano oil

2499 2018-10-22 19:12:55 Money and oil
2500 2018-10-22 19:12:55 never said there is wrong with the WHL...I grew up watching the Wheat Kings live at the Keystone Centre...also covered them as well as the Rebels, Pats and Oil Kings. It's just not the NHL.
2501 2018-10-22 19:12:52 In early 80's Volker threw dual mandate out the window. He raised interest rates through the roof to purposefully create an artificial recession that threw millions out of work and supposedly killed stagflation. Stagflation was actually killed by world oil glut and OPEC collapse.
2502 2018-10-22 19:12:50 Canceling a deal so we take a bone saw to one of our own limbs ?????....... cancel a few tankers of oil .. that would be a meaningful response
2503 2018-10-22 19:12:40 Let's keep buying oil from our friends Saudi Arabia.  #RespectHumanRights
2504 2018-10-22 19:12:33 Haha I see where your comparison lies- in the tip! I am inspired by myself and will bring some artichokes home, cut lengthwise, brush some olive oil and salt to the flesh and grill..I think you boil them for a few beforehand.  Hmm color me determined
2505 2018-10-22 19:12:22 @realDonaldTrump @SecretaryZinke  Can Trump fix oil spill that has been leaking millions of barrels into Gulf of Mexico & that has gone unplugged for so long that it now is becoming one of worst offshore disasters in U.S. history. Bush & Obama couldn’t fix it. Can Trump?
2506 2018-10-22 19:12:08 My husband just gave me a whooooole lesson on the importance of engine oil and I told him to just do it for me since he knows so much. “wHaT wOuLd yOu dO wItHoUt mE” headass 
2507 2018-10-22 19:12:03 Oil!
2508 2018-10-22 19:12:00 Potatoes, sliced into thick wedges, cooked in gloriously unhealthy oil till crispy outside but soft inside, sprinkled with sea salt and fresh ground peppercorns then topped with a few dashes of malt vinegar....
2509 2018-10-22 19:11:59 @dpfdpf why hasn't one of my mates on the left said not one more drop of dirty oil form Saudi Arabia
2510 2018-10-22 19:11:54 I'm sorry we didn't address this earlier.  I'm sorry so many of us turned a blind eye.  It's time to rethink our dependency on Saudi oil, or overthrow a government, I guess.
2511 2018-10-22 19:11:37 #Khashoggi and War in #Yemen? I know there are 3 billion Barrels of proved oil and gas reserves in Yemen, that is why neither US administration nor European governments want to help the Yemenis being bombed by #SaudiArabia all of them are thirsty for Oil & Gas.
2512 2018-10-22 19:11:36 I called kingsburg express lube and they wanted $75 for an oil change.. chale I’ll do it myself #lazymonday
2513 2018-10-22 19:11:21 oil pan, youre done. oh im about to take a sloppy sloppy oil shower
2514 2018-10-22 19:11:10 While their subsidiaries like Oil&Gas or Tobacco pay well, the Devil themself pays like garbage.
2515 2018-10-22 19:11:07 Jose & Pep are the greatest managers since Ferguson retired. Jose edges Pep because he’s won more with less club spending. Pep at City gets to sign whomever he wants-Abu Dhabi oil money. When Jose is backed in transfer market, he wins in dominant fashion. Yes,he is too emotional
2516 2018-10-22 19:11:05 Since the dress has been controversial all day, what is the use of talking again besides adding oil to the fire?
2517 2018-10-22 19:11:03 NDP pushing government to put 2000 Ont workers out of a job, which won't punish Saudis. They'd just give contact to USA.  So be taking revenge on Canadians for a crime they didn't commit on a person who has no ties to Canada. Common sense says we should stop buying their oil.
2518 2018-10-22 19:10:30 So Fox and CRTV aren't trump tv? They're just shilling for free. wow. Trump is a great snake oil salesman. @Zigmanfreud

2526 2018-10-22 19:09:46 Lolz. Get a life. North Dakota should be covered with wind mills and oil rigs. It's a horrible state.
2527 2018-10-22 19:09:44 everytime I come to jiffy lube for an oil change they clean tf outta my car and I’m so grateful <3
2528 2018-10-22 19:09:44 I use Nivea! I know what u mean how in the winter you need that extra, use the coconut oil technique
2529 2018-10-22 19:09:07 We used Ravenol in our pinto my sons stockcar . He revved it to 8400 and at the end of each race no loss of oil pressure . Yep it’s the best
2530 2018-10-22 19:08:51 For hydration and moisture use coconut oil, put it all over for about 10 mins and then wash off using ur normal routine then your normal cream and your face in the morning will feel so soft like a baby’s bum 
2531 2018-10-22 19:08:37 All valid points.I just think the British press are disrespecting Mourinho.Mourinho & Pep are the 2 greatest managers in the world; Pep has unlimited funds from Abu Dhabi oil money;Glazers at United barely invest transfer money at the level United need; Pep signs whoever he wants
2532 2018-10-22 19:08:07 move to nigeria and become a runs babe to the oil tycoons..

2535 2018-10-22 19:07:37 I didn’t paint it, but I know who did. It’s actually oil paint on a door!
2536 2018-10-22 19:07:36 Personally I disagree with them Jimmy is leaking major oil it used to be we can’t win without Jimmy now it looks we can’t win with Humphrey
2537 2018-10-22 19:07:29 Did you know stores have pulled their cannabis oil WITHOUT THC because of the laws? Recreational users can get high, but our old dog can't walk now!

#MAGA #SaudiArabia
2542 2018-10-22 19:06:56 There has been some narratives that Saudi Arabia oil fields have been depleted. If they run out of oil, it will free us up to control oil prices, and have more global influence. This political 4D chess is hard to keep track of. My head hurts sometimes trying to keep up.
2543 2018-10-22 19:06:54 Aunty doctor, just tell us excess oil isn't harmful as we thought. Which one be plas plas..
2544 2018-10-22 19:06:50 Providing competition to them by getting our ethical oil to the world market will, it would also be a nice touch if the CDN gov came to the conclusion that buying oil from itself rather than from a country like SA. We don’t murder and butcher journalists here.
2545 2018-10-22 19:06:34 "I believe the Union has served UK well" - Of course it has - Scotland's oil subsidised rUK for years.
My question was in what ways has the union been good for Scotland? You seem to be unable to provide any facts to support your assertion, but go ahead and try...
2546 2018-10-22 19:06:14 Snake oil salesmen
2547 2018-10-22 19:06:00 I feel the same about #BBCnews . Its billed as impartial but clearly isn't. What they choose as headlines, who they let speak, who gets the last word, etc. Eg: coverage of #Fracking  is blatantly an "oil vs troublemakers" narrative #propaganda
2548 2018-10-22 19:05:37 The #Saudis and their handlers in Washington do not understand that after 17 days of complete denials, so whatever asinine cover up stories they come up with it will have zero credibility added to its bad reputation outside the circles of oil and arms merchants.  #Jamal_Khashoogi
2549 2018-10-22 19:05:28 Cbd and thc totally different lol but i fuck with the thc oil..
2550 2018-10-22 19:05:26 When I worked at BNN, anchor Jim O'Connell, who has since sadly passed away, joked about pitching a call-in show on oil and gas called "Bitchin' About Bitumen." Still makes me smile years later.
2551 2018-10-22 19:05:24 Why are we still importing oil from Saudi Arabia. Given the current circumstances it seems a bit bizarre. The silence in QP about our dependence on Saudi oil was deafening today? Wouldn't that be a good question for the NDP?
2552 2018-10-22 19:05:24 The sound of popcorn popping like crazy in oil was the only sound on that side of the kitchen.

{Hm.}
2553 2018-10-22 19:05:23 I’ve said b4 & say again, we’re a 1 issue nation.

2557 2018-10-22 19:05:01 Because they own our governments with their extravagant fortunes and oil?
2558 2018-10-22 19:04:54 Ik werd vorig jaar door SA oil gevraagd voor zeer luxe workshop...maar om nou naar een land te gaan waar de inwoners die dezelfde (wetenschappelijke) ideeën hebben als ik geëxecuteerd worden...simpele kwestie om niet te gaan.
2559 2018-10-22 19:04:43 Sorry for late reply. I just cut it in half, took out the seeds, brushed with grape seed oil, peppered and cooked on high in microwave for 8 min. I put some pasta sauce over it with chicken mushrooms diced but it really tastes great without anything on it.
2560 2018-10-22 19:04:40 10.4 million barrels of oil per day can buy 2000 x #Khashoggi

Nothing is gonna happen. 
This too shall pass.
2561 2018-10-22 19:04:25 Go join a biker gang and smuggle meth to the oil fields ya duck duck goose bastard  s/o the pretzels though honestly
2562 2018-10-22 19:04:25 In other words he said, "Even if the USA puts sanctions & a blockade on the export of our oil, we will utterly destroy the US army & send terrorists to destroy  them at home with their own weapons. We will slaughter anyone who disagrees!" A true businessman! Now that's official!

2564 2018-10-22 19:04:21 The NDP wants government to put 2000 workers in Ontario out of a job. Which would make CPC very happy. But would not punish Saudis who'd just give contract to friend of Trump. Better if Canada stopped buying Saudi oil. We have our own  oil plus own a pipeline to deliver product.
2565 2018-10-22 19:04:16 They still have to play the oil and they fill their diapers every time that happens
2566 2018-10-22 19:04:05 @realDonaldTrump #MBS Mr. Bone Saw had full knowledge of the murder. Wake up! When will we take back our American Oil Company.  The world is sick of Saudi Qatar and UAE royals of parading around London Paris and New York. @Twitch @FoxNews @CNN @BBC @UN @NATO #khashoggi
2567 2018-10-22 19:03:59 Stop buying their oil, news flash !! we have a province that you can buy it from.
2568 2018-10-22 19:03:59 Much as this is a wonderful step in the right direction, two things; 1) you're not displaying the Leaping Bunny symbol which means that the materials you use to make your products might still have been tested on animals. 2) still using palm oil?

2570 2018-10-22 19:03:52 Nah I work hard for my money started drone company on side.
65k is half what I was on before oil went in 2015.. I took a job at 20k so didn't need sign on.. Studied part time and got my Msc engineering risk management .
Served 26 years in HM forces.. So think deserve what I make.

2574 2018-10-22 19:03:09 If you're picking up your birth control from a pharmacy you're 2000 and late. The Pill Club delivers it with chocolate/tea/stickers/essential oil/etc for free (with insurance) every month you can even opt for free plan b too this is some type of futuristic shit
2575 2018-10-22 19:02:55 so your saying that the turks are spying on the Saudi's? well the turk did kill a lot of his generals & Kurds  when he took office? the turks have been running guns and stealing oil? I real don't care about this terrorist who was killed.

2578 2018-10-22 19:02:34 Thank you for bringing this to our attention. Can you confirm what oil was recommended for your vehicle?
2579 2018-10-22 19:02:24 Also the seeds, dried and lightly toasted in a frying pan without oil, taste like dark peanut butter.
2580 2018-10-22 19:02:16 The most whitest things I've ever seen are the following. Saying that coca cola is spicy, avocado toast, too much mayonnaise, premature aging, and consuming coconut oil. In these moments, I'm a bit thankful that my ass came from the Latinosphere not the Anglosphere.
2581 2018-10-22 19:02:16 *throws some rosehip oil at you*
2582 2018-10-22 19:02:09 These people about to piss me off I just want my oil changed so I can go home
2583 2018-10-22 19:01:58 You had me worried. . He's cut from the same cloth as snake oil salesman, Rodgers.  What a partnership they'd make 
2584 2018-10-22 19:01:48 I am curious what wins did we negotiate, we gave up market share on dairy and still have tariffs on steel and aluminum, i will give you the proportionality clause was a win as it will make shipping our oil overseas through our soon to be built pipeline much easier.
2585 2018-10-22 19:01:47 Oil & Vinegar
2586 2018-10-22 19:01:44 Have they suggested that you try some evening primrose oil capsules? That's supposed to help soften the cervix so you can dilate more easily. Also there's always the suggestion of trying to get a few orgasms in to get the muscles moving. >_>
2587 2018-10-22 19:01:40 Gloss you in oil taste your G juice then fill you with happiness in both your holes
2588 2018-10-22 19:01:29 That won’t last long with your new regulation removal...let’s pollute it with filthy oil and coal!
2589 2018-10-22 19:01:27 Quid pro quo, yo. They sell us oil rights and we... Allow them to continue to be awful ass-backwards human beings with disgusting social policy
2590 2018-10-22 19:01:15 I’m sorry what I see was a dragon....spit that burning oil ball at your enemy
2591 2018-10-22 19:01:11 Pro tip: use the same measuring cup to add the oil and honey and do the oil first. That way the honey slides right out ...
2592 2018-10-22 19:00:58 You mean like building Canada east so we don't have to import Saudi oil?
2593 2018-10-22 19:00:54 He also promised to immediately cut the size of the AB government in half. Lovely! Except you know... that would put 100,000 people in AB out of work, remove 100,000 consumers from the economy. Oil crash cost 35,000 jobs for perspective.
2594 2018-10-22 19:00:50 I like grassy. It depends on the function of the oil.
2595 2018-10-22 19:00:50 Idea: someone should sponsor a contest. Only college students can apply. They work in teams. They figure out how to get us off Saudi oil. Best idea wins, I dunno, a coupla million or somethin'.
2596 2018-10-22 19:00:47 Not to be dramatic but I’d let a doctor perform emergency surgery to take out the fish oil capsule I took this morning if it meant I wouldn’t feel nauseous and lightheaded anymore 
2597 2018-10-22 19:00:36 If you really love me buy sustainable palm oil to protect the habitat of the Okapi so I know it’s real

2602 2018-10-22 19:00:12 The only oatcakes that are palm oil free are Patersons
2603 2018-10-22 19:00:07 This whole situation smells very weird. But okay oil is more importend than a pressman according to Trump I guess.
2604 2018-10-22 19:00:02 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!
2605 2018-10-22 19:00:01 "Supply-demand theorists glance at this graph and declare that the trend toward more U.S. oil production caused oil's price to fall. But the claim does not bear scrutiny."

See why.
2606 2018-10-22 18:59:58 Well, my engine went up in flames omw home after an oil change last May. No one was hurt fortunately, but I spent my savings buying another car :'). It's been a stressful saga, but I'm glad I'll have closure soon
2607 2018-10-22 18:59:56 Wow, his Kid knows that Dad is too far out there.
2608 2018-10-22 18:59:54 Challah: two packets of yeast in 2 cups of warm water. When they prove, add 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup honey and a pinch of salt. Add flour until solid - about 7 cups. Knead. Let rise. Punch down and shape. Let rise again. Brush with egg. Bake about 25 minutes at 190 if 2 loaves.

2610 2018-10-22 18:59:47 Somebody needs to design code, replace robots, oil them etc. 

So a handful of people will be in charge of all production while everyone sits around and does what?!? Write poetry & take naps? Smoke weed?! Only people who want UBI are lazy fools.

2613 2018-10-22 18:59:31 Make sure you oil your body up
2614 2018-10-22 18:59:29 I'm sitting waiting for my oil change and forgot headphones
There's two older men talking about football
It's cute
2615 2018-10-22 18:59:11 Putting 2000 workers in Ont out of a job won't hurt Saudis. They'll give the contract to friend of Trump. Not buying their oil would hurt them. Canadians own pipeline.  Have product. That's our excuse to stop buying. Germany put deal on hold. Didn't cancel as NDP want PM to do
2616 2018-10-22 18:59:11 Completely different regulations being cut.  Bush admin did it to line their pockets from their overseas oil companies.  Trump is getting rid of wasteful regulations that push companies to manufacture overseas and not here.  Jobs are up amd companies are spending money.  Stop
2617 2018-10-22 18:58:58 So guys. How long do you reckon it takes to dig and find oil, cos we have been reading a never ending story on one nose piercing for close to three months now. It's literally not that deep is it?
2618 2018-10-22 18:58:50 It's been an unqualified success. The oil companies and defense contractors became insanely rich. The Saudis that pay our leaders rose in power and prestige. Dubya was re-elected. Even under Obama the endless pointless war policy continued with SoS Hillary.

Total victory for DC.
2619 2018-10-22 18:58:44 Zinke comes to New Mexico all the time for oil and to destroy our natural world  he is not a good people for anyone or anyone’s health
2620 2018-10-22 18:58:39 Not after you reversed all the protections  @BarackObama  put on the environment. You're a snake oil salesmen that is destroying our country. #DonTheCon #WorstPresidentEver
2621 2018-10-22 18:58:30 That happens a lot to me but within a couple of days the pimple is completely gone. I put coconut oil and moisture directly on it after washing to prevent it from breaking.
2622 2018-10-22 18:58:27 drill into it keep well-away with oil drilling gear and contaminate explosives with water/acid? ?
2623 2018-10-22 18:58:27 We don’t need to worry about fishing. I’ve designed a way to make sure there’s an infinite supply of everything. Just announce that “x” is running out prior to the next referendum then be amazed at the abundance of “x” straight after.
Magic referendums. Even works on oil.
2624 2018-10-22 18:58:18 You're trying to diversify from oil yet you dumped millions of dollars into oil exploration in barren areas

Well done
2625 2018-10-22 18:58:15 Fry them in a bit of oil then stick em in a wrap with other nice stuff then chilli up the fucker!
2626 2018-10-22 18:57:47 so glad i have extra body wash at home because my ass left a fresh new bottle of dial marula oil body wash in Dallas.  i just knew i was gonna forget somethin’.
2627 2018-10-22 18:57:41 Welp, sitting and waiting for my oil change was my adulting thing for the day.
2628 2018-10-22 18:57:38 A real life Oil of Olay advert!
2629 2018-10-22 18:57:31 you cant tell people to stop their habits. its useless. the only solution is DAC...you cant tell Saudi Arabia or Norway to stop getting oil out of the ground. The only way for you not to waste your time and energy, is to get Sweden to design a DAC.
2630 2018-10-22 18:57:27 This might sound hella weird, but one of the only things that got rid of a chronic ear infection for me was garlic oil in the ear LOL. Apparently garlic helps flush the system so the bacteria not killed can’t re-infest. For me, ear infections are seasonal tho so IDK

2633 2018-10-22 18:57:00 31 i think. Ba ja madi a oil.
2634 2018-10-22 18:56:39 If my last time voting in Colorado (we might move) helps force oil companies to build their toxic wells further away from homes, I will be very happy. 

I'd rather they not exist at all, but we know some distance prevents cancer. We can do this.
2635 2018-10-22 18:56:31 The nigga that did my oil change smell sour af and left that smell in my shit
2636 2018-10-22 18:56:21 Cameroon is sub-Saharan Africa's 6th largest crude oil producer.
2637 2018-10-22 18:56:19 how is this a win for anyone other than international gas and oil companies based in the US again?
2638 2018-10-22 18:56:07 This will be used as an excuse to put sanction on KSA. The real reason? Saudis are planning to sell oil in Yuan. Everyone will follow (€ as well) and then who will buy UST?
2639 2018-10-22 18:55:55 Coconut oil for all your hair miseries.
Feels good touching mine
2640 2018-10-22 18:55:53 @tradingview I’ve been paper trading with y’all about a few months now and at least 4-5 trades per month show false profits. Yesterday I closed 130 Crude Oil shares at 69.43 that were bought at 69.22 and it paper profited me $1,800. Might be a bug you’d wanna look into fixing.
2641 2018-10-22 18:55:49 Blue decided it was a great idea to eat all of my coconut oil I had left and then throw it up all over my apartment 
2642 2018-10-22 18:55:22 tadi liat saran org di wf sih pake face oil kek produk kleveru jenis apapun itu trs dipijet”idungnya trs diemin baru lap pake kapas yg dituangin micellar water
2643 2018-10-22 18:55:01 Losses the European countries will suffer, they will lose a strategic trading partner. Also, the rise in oil prices will be very effective for the western citizen and the European street will not be silent.
2644 2018-10-22 18:54:48 Yeah but they give us a ton of oil so shhhhhhhhhh
2645 2018-10-22 18:54:39 @randy_wagnerr OIL

Welcome to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia .. The fastest growing countries in the world .. The largest countries to export oil .. Attracted the Islamic countries .. A geographical location connecting the continents .. I repeat to you in Saudi Arabia.
2650 2018-10-22 18:53:58 All of your deregulation and pushing of oil and coal is going to ruin our air and water.  You only care about money and nothing else.  You are the worst US president EVER.

2652 2018-10-22 18:53:21 Oh Lord....These Wannabees...Now they're drinking cooking oil...kuri kuda kunzi vakunwa zvodhura

2653 2018-10-22 18:53:14 So that is why the US does not voice more concern about all the tons of radioactive water being released into the Pacific Ocean by the Fukushima site in Japan.  It is just as bad at polluting the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean with oil!
2654 2018-10-22 18:53:07 dipijet pake face oil coba baru tar keluar. aku baru mau coba sih gatau ngaruh apa engga
2655 2018-10-22 18:53:07 I don’t feel like getting no oil change they probably go be close by the time I get off anyway
2656 2018-10-22 18:53:06 Oh I love Neck Oil  @andy_husband1 @mathewsmith1 

Mmmmm..... there’s a thought 
2657 2018-10-22 18:52:58 The CPC/NDP would be jumping with joy if the government put 2000 Ontario workers out a job. That wouldn't punish the Saudis, as a friend of Trump would pick up the contract.  Germany just put their deal on hold. They didn't cancel. Better if the world would stop buying their oil

2661 2018-10-22 18:52:23 Not quite... although oil has historically helped and Dundee is an IT centre.

The Barnett formula means they get more than they contribute back
2662 2018-10-22 18:52:05 Mmmm... tea tree oil...

Mine makes my hair super soft and smells like cake. That's all I need to know about it.
2663 2018-10-22 18:52:05 do you think we can replace oil with National Emergy?
2664 2018-10-22 18:52:05 You dumb remark about #Cannabis users was very ignorant. With over 700 medical uses and was in Jesus Christ's Holy Annointing Oil. Was called Kaneh Bosom, Greek for Cannabis, Pharma in Greek means Evil Magic. How many Kids cured their Cancer and Seizures with it? You're insulting
2665 2018-10-22 18:51:54 well to hell with them - is the uk not aware of the 2nd largest oil find in the south - its called the weald basin!
2666 2018-10-22 18:51:52 Day 15 of doing nothing but talk.
If you got a pipeline or 2 built you could’ve used that money on green infrastructure and improved oil extraction technologies that are environmental friendly but you’ve pissed away 3 years. Your unemployment rate is unheard of in Alberta! #fail
2667 2018-10-22 18:51:50 Just read a recipe for vegan mayo. It uses the liquid off a can of chickpeas mixed with Dijon mustard, oil and lemon juice.  The liquid is called aquafaba.  It was in Huffington post vegan BLT recipe.

2671 2018-10-22 18:51:43 can't wait until the oil runs out there or we're no longer dependent on it tbh
2672 2018-10-22 18:51:37 The Saud family is nothing less than the Gambino family with more money! Oil drives their intentions and USA needs to ramp up production so the crime family of the Middle East becomes irrelevant!  Do not sell arms to these ppl - remember 9/11& Wahhabism
2673 2018-10-22 18:51:35 Okay, here's my vague recollection of my French onion soup...
3 large onions, finely sliced. Fry on a medium heat with a glug of olive oil and a spoon of sugar to help caramelise them. Fry for about 20-30 mins until nicely coloured. Add a minced garlic clove to fry for a minute.
2674 2018-10-22 18:51:29 I’ve been here since 1:30 for an oil change & it’s almost 3  like damn are they putting a new engine in that mf?

It seems to me that the Saudis should produce his body. Where is it? Saudi Arabia and the US have a long conspirators history. Bomb our buildings is ok as long as oil prices are controlled.
2677 2018-10-22 18:51:21 So snake oil salesmen and predatory lending is ok?

2682 2018-10-22 18:50:56 Another question Roy. How much of Alberta's oil is being shipped by rail?
2683 2018-10-22 18:50:45 Or we could start using more green energy, and get rid of oil...

2684 2018-10-22 18:50:36 for some reason the smell of pink oil puts my mind @ ease
2685 2018-10-22 18:50:30 I like the sound of :Rock Oil' Cat.
2686 2018-10-22 18:50:25 Took a car for an oil change was told that it's urgent replace all brakes. Said no took it to Firestone no brakes needed.
2687 2018-10-22 18:50:16 Just placed my order also! My husband & I are gonna give the THC free version a whirl. We know a lot of folks who use CBD oil and have great results! Thanks @TheRealHublife  for leading us into the right direction!
2688 2018-10-22 18:50:15 Whatever...... as long as money is green and oil is slick..... you won’t interrupt this relationship. USA is that girl that won’t leave her boyfriend (Saudi) and no he ain’t shit.

Ahead of the coming #EIAReport, the United States Strategic Petroleum Reserves (SPR) has shed another 1.1 million barrels over the past week down to 656.5 million. This is taxpayer oil that is sold to commercial entities; hence added to commercial storage/use. #OOTT

Buhari's administration has been earning more from Crude oil.
2694 2018-10-22 18:49:33 Your report misses an important point. This is that the opposition party actually began the negotiation programme with the oil militants and some will argue are their prefered political allies given the geopolitical sentiments of Nigerian politics. Back channels exist either way.

2696 2018-10-22 18:49:17 ITS NOT GOOD. Okay the chicken is good , the grilled anyway. The spicy is okay if the oil is new. 
2697 2018-10-22 18:49:16 I fought for that pasta and would've gone back to fight for the truffle oil.
2698 2018-10-22 18:49:14 What do you expect frm dat silly regime.They've enjoyed too much pampering frm US &UK in exchange for oil. Too much blood on their hands.
2699 2018-10-22 18:49:11 Imagine if you all taught your daughters how to change the locks on their doors, change their windshield wipers, change their oil and change their tires.  This world would be a much different place.

HOMECOMING READY
2704 2018-10-22 18:48:34 One man machine, just need some oil.
2705 2018-10-22 18:48:28 You forgot:

4. People must know that private companies import oil, not the gov’t

5. If people are upset there’s no law banning oil from “dictator” countries, then all govts  - past and present - are to blame.

6. One country has held SA’s feet to the fire all along: ours.
2706 2018-10-22 18:48:27 Lmao real dumb!  all I can think about is damn, you gotta ask every restaurant and every house you visit the type of cooking oil they use? Time consuming 
2707 2018-10-22 18:48:23 My invested in Oil Wells right here in Indiana, yes Indiana, needless to say he lost $5,000 but got a hat. His $5000 hat he would say.
2708 2018-10-22 18:48:21 Petrol? Bread and cooking oil!
2709 2018-10-22 18:48:19 Why don’t you provide examples of this so called Iranian terror Larry?! Supporting a country like Saudi who have no historical cultural similarities with West is the biggest mistake. From 9/11 to khashoggi, all America see is oil and arms sales
2710 2018-10-22 18:48:15 @repblumenauer  Well thank you Earl. Your use of common sense is a breath of fresh air... (Sprays tea tree oil to cover the pot smell) now it's fresh air. Sorry about that
2711 2018-10-22 18:48:05 Susan is from Maine, prepare a subtle bottom fish for the hellabit, using heads and extra eyeballs. Serve with fiddleheads, her specialty, mix with castor oil, garnish with deadly nightshade.
2712 2018-10-22 18:47:51 Quit buying their gd Oil 
2713 2018-10-22 18:47:47 Israel vrs Nigeria??? LOL let's pretend this isn't about the Oil
2714 2018-10-22 18:47:31 But surely everyone in Louisiana is gainfully employed, has free college for their kids, lives in their own McMansion, drives the best cars, and eats like royalty for all this oil production off their coast. No? Just dead fish and oil slicks? Still, not a peep from the populace.
2715 2018-10-22 18:47:20 The disconnection is amazing, you retweet a story about meeting with your donors in the oil and gas industry to get your marching orders as a good thing. Not sure what is worse you think that is good or the people that vote for you thinking you care about any besides your donors
2716 2018-10-22 18:47:14 Why did they put CBD oil in it is my question. Do they have like back pain

2720 2018-10-22 18:46:30 They prefer to give the saudis the gift, of course for money. The attackers on 9/11 were Saudis. Iran was under control with the agreement signed by @POTUS44 . But @POTUS wanted money for his business and terminated as a gift to saudis. Now they own him and @GOP . Oil prices?
2721 2018-10-22 18:46:27 Just hearing this for the first time now that palm oil causes malaria. Lol
2722 2018-10-22 18:46:20 I am guessing that those Central American countries are getting more $$$ from USA from illegal immigrants sending $$ back to families in their country than they get in US aid.  Mexico #2 source of economic revenues behind oil is $$ sent to families from USA.

2724 2018-10-22 18:46:11 @DennisPrager @SuePrager Unlike when you sell gold, annuities & other financial snake oil scams to your listeners aka victims on behalf of your advertisers, car salespeople at least look up the easy answers.

2730 2018-10-22 18:45:09 I believe you don't care about pollution and climate change because of EVIDENCE. You applauded when, on a whim, he got us out of the Paris Accord
He has consistently undone every rule that would protect the environment, favouring coal and oil. I rest my case.
2731 2018-10-22 18:45:09 @itzbil_ how far out oil business
2732 2018-10-22 18:45:07 No, petrol price in neighboring cities will also bounce back. Its the centre govt which is fooling people, 2.5 Rs reduction is also not good for oil companies; it will hit revenue when crude is hiking. Hence such a reduction is not sustainable, take few days before its gone.
2733 2018-10-22 18:45:03 That liberal MSNBC will tell you explicitly now that the US cannot cut its ties to the House of Saud. Famine, no matter. Assassinations, no matter. The US cannot afford to stop its military Keynesianism nor its continued reliance on cheap oil. 

#tearitalldown
2734 2018-10-22 18:44:56 What isn't realistic is "cooking without the need of oil!" Like comeon ...if you are to cook,cook with the right ingredients for good food.If you are going to mess up your meal then rather dont cook. Cooking oil has always been that central cooking ingredient since ancient Egypt
2735 2018-10-22 18:44:47 Castor oil at the ready to help it grow back!

2739 2018-10-22 18:44:35 my mom, Florence, always used Wesson oil. One day the phone rang and she gabbed on and on for like 20 minutes, forgetting she left the chicken soaking in oil in the electric skillet. But it turned out grrrreat! It wasn’t greasy at all!That’s Wessonality! 
2740 2018-10-22 18:44:35 You should try CBD Oil (no not weed) I started a few days ago for my anxiety and migraines. And so far I haven't had any headaches and I been calm in normal situation I would be anxious.  Definitely recommend!
2741 2018-10-22 18:44:24 Drink water, use witch hazel, also. Cetaphil works good too & wash your face w/ cold water .. bio oil clears dark marks as well .. stress be fucking my skin up too
2742 2018-10-22 18:44:23 Getting oil changed but I pretend the maintenance dude is @schreiber_pablo & we plan a trip to Mexico to get away, ride horses bareback on the beach & at night we solve the worlds problems while playing with the fire we make from driftwood. Day dreams keep us sane ya'll...
2743 2018-10-22 18:44:21 You just walk across to the why pipo aisle, get shampoo and conditioner (tresemme or organics work just fine, the 900ml will last you a long time). Then just buy castor oil (Hercules), extra virgin olive oil, keep a spray bottle with water and glycerine.
2744 2018-10-22 18:44:13 I am pouring sweat, covered in years worth of oil, metal shavings, dirt, coolant. All I want is to be out of work so I can take a fucking shower.

2746 2018-10-22 18:44:02 Aswear; I was cooking it when I realised it.
2747 2018-10-22 18:43:55 Nope, slow cooker retains lots of water and you want it to cook down. Do add water if it’s drying up. I seared the beef and lightly fried the coconut in the leftover oil, dumped in the slow cooker with tomatoes, coconut cream and the paste, gave it a good stir and left it alone.
2748 2018-10-22 18:43:48 Or the drilling for oil off the already damaged coast of Florida? Or the “Global Warming is a myth” that the party like to boast about? I think you have conservative mixed with conservation!
2749 2018-10-22 18:43:48 There is a 14 YEAR LONG OIL SPILL in the Gulf of Mexico that is releasing 300-700 barrels PER DAY yet the Trump administration is proposing the largest expansion of leases for offshore oil industries, despite our desperate need to combat climate change.
2750 2018-10-22 18:43:47 Me either and if the oil is at all a fair representation I'm fine with that.
2751 2018-10-22 18:43:45 Noooo! Canada is already dealing with justinObama 2.0 and our oil is at a deep discount - we’re suffering enough!
2752 2018-10-22 18:43:44 Today I dropped SOOOO MANY things like almost everything i pegang jatuh buat maggi pun the oil jatuh tumpah, tadi lunch nak letak nasi dalam pinggan pun nasi jatuh, anddd even tadi nak press handwash pun dia jatuh tak masuk dalam tangan!!! Tu semua contoh je tau banyak lagi 
2753 2018-10-22 18:43:30 In most of the world, ie not the US, pharma companies aren't allowed to advertise, period. Most agree here. You refer mostly to a US problem.

Secondly, with "tu quoque" ("you too"), all the problems in pharma industry don't make snake oil like homeopathy real or ethical.
2754 2018-10-22 18:43:10 This one has tea tree oil and magic

2758 2018-10-22 18:42:37 that exorcism was so fake, what priest acts like that he was more of a used snake oil salesman than a man of god, the victim seemed like an extra from a death metal video.  Love the rest of the show!
2759 2018-10-22 18:42:31 In a month where I really need no extra out goings, my car develops an oil leak. Shut up universe.
2760 2018-10-22 18:42:30 I love the lil massage after getting my nails done. The oil, cracking my joints, stroking my shit. Orgasmic. Like damn, Boo, we jus met

2763 2018-10-22 18:42:22 Zowel zon als wind en in mindere mate waterstof zijn niets anders dan tussenvormen op weg naar zero uitstoot, wat nucleair nieuwe stijl inhoudt. Vandaar dat deze drie juist omarmd worden door big oil, want fossiel blijft broodnodig ernaast.

2795 2018-10-22 18:39:42 In most cases they were not informed of the inflated apr around the corner... Sure they were suckered, but that doesn't mean the snake oil salesmen were blameless...
2796 2018-10-22 18:39:41 If Trump greenlighted plot to assassinate Khashoggi and if CIA knew but decided not to warn him, that simply means US wanted leverage over the kingdom, which could come in handy in propping up/taking down MbS, in oil price negotiations, in using Saudis to deal with Iran, etc.

2830 2018-10-22 18:36:39 I love getting oil changes... Cuz the 1st few hundred miles be smooth as hell
2831 2018-10-22 18:36:39 consume virgin coconut oil, helps a lot
2832 2018-10-22 18:36:33 I know you think that was some smart line but you just come off as an ignorant tool. Stop pretending your bf Trudeau is anything less than what you'd want your PM to be. He's anti-environment and is a lover oil pipelines just like his predecessor.
2833 2018-10-22 18:36:10 A 14-year-long oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico verges on becoming one of the worst in U.S. history : Why trump don't clean that up?
2834 2018-10-22 18:36:00 I use a couple of oil filled radiators. Do have a big halogen heater but I'm a bit wary of it when there's a lot of dust around, tend to reserve it just for when I'm using finishes like tung oil.
2835 2018-10-22 18:35:56 I cant say the same. My mom throws on a slice of cheese and like two pieces of meat and calls it a day. You gotta toast that bread, throw on some oregano & basil, spray that bready bitch with olive oil and stack the meat boiii.
2836 2018-10-22 18:35:44 I miss being able to oil paint at home without suffocating myself in fumes
2837 2018-10-22 18:35:41 Having long nails and working with oil pastels doesn’t work for me  how do others do it???
2838 2018-10-22 18:35:34 aight ty, imma start using castor oil too
2839 2018-10-22 18:35:33 The military is also in the vest pocket of capitalism and we therefore, intervene in countries with strategic resources - the number one thing is oil but in Vietnam it was Rubber (still needed) and Tin (for electronics). Nixon said that on Camera. See Ken Burns' "Vietnam" Ep. 1.
2840 2018-10-22 18:35:31 Mine was something like that got to just start buying the oil and filter and taking it to the shop this shit absurd lol
2841 2018-10-22 18:35:21 I'm regrowing a FULL & THICK beard. gonna be a bit unkept for the next 6 weeks then. Coconut oil and Beard Tonic twice a day. Everyday.... December going No.1 brush cut and let the BEARD flourish....
2842 2018-10-22 18:35:19 Doesn't that make you feel great??
If I look a little younger then I am,I owe it all to the Oil of Olay company..
Yanks age me 5 years for every 1,so thanks Olayyy  haha :)
2843 2018-10-22 18:35:18 You want to tax oil and gas more Ted?  You deserve Trump treating you poorly
2844 2018-10-22 18:35:00 And US is a glorified gluttonous eater of oil 
2845 2018-10-22 18:34:55 & old motor oil
2846 2018-10-22 18:34:55 Therefore, in order to only use Canadian oil there are 2 choices:
1. Build more refinery capacity for heavy oil in Alberta
2. Reduce Canadian dependency on oil
I suspect no oil company will pony up billions to build a refinery now when world has agreed to get off fossils by 2050
2847 2018-10-22 18:34:53 Oil based paint wins again
2848 2018-10-22 18:34:47 My mom says "oleev oil"
2849 2018-10-22 18:34:47 Pumpkin spiced motor oil?
2850 2018-10-22 18:34:45 Do castor oil. Also moisturize before oiling.
2851 2018-10-22 18:34:43 Oil was less than a buck per quart when they were used
2852 2018-10-22 18:34:43 Wow Russia has no plans of going to war with Germany and Germans have a good deal with Russia right now on oil why would they buy American oil that’s really tainted with war Russia is earning respect by staying out of America soap opera

2857 2018-10-22 18:34:11 If you have $600 billion in cash and 235 billion barrels of oil, then you have a distinct long term advantage over Erdogan.
2858 2018-10-22 18:34:07 Just purchased oil for my car and a #monster for me. Cashier “That’s quite a combination.” Yep, things winners need. #MondayMotivation
2859 2018-10-22 18:34:06 If the price of oil is so low, why is the price at the pump so high? You don't seemed to be even slightly concerned about what corporations charged for their carbon.
2860 2018-10-22 18:34:03 Olive oil and salt are all I need for my salad  olive oil just tastes amazing
2861 2018-10-22 18:34:00 Can we use that oil as a preventative measure for all these? Can you also give us the simplest way of how to prepare this oil so that we don’t have to keep buying the expensive type?

2866 2018-10-22 18:33:47 I"ll try it. I did order some of the Nigella sativa oil and Blue lotus tea.
2867 2018-10-22 18:33:40 I mean I prefer not to use artificial oils, I'd rather use a natural carrier oil like jojoba oil or something.
2868 2018-10-22 18:33:28 things this year has taught me so far:
- physics is impossible 
- peanut m&m’s are the perfect meal replacement 
- the oil icon telling you you need an oil change isn’t lying, you really need to get your oil changed. emily for the love of god get your oil changed.

2870 2018-10-22 18:33:24 Cancelling the  arms deal  would  be  meaningless to  them .....  cancelling a  few  oil purchase  orders ...now that  would  be  meaningful !!!
2871 2018-10-22 18:33:23 Truffle oil is a modern ingredient used to impart the flavour and aroma of truffles to things . Restaurants tend to drizzle it on things so they can charge 50% extra. Perhaps I just don’t like the taste of truffles.
2872 2018-10-22 18:33:06 Stop the oil imports instead. 
3000 direct jobs, 500 suppliers, 10k spinoff jobs. Why penalize these people? Cut off SA income, not, livelihoods of Cdns.
2873 2018-10-22 18:33:05 Sure, they (oil fueled Arabs) had a big role in recent times. But without them there would still be a postcolonial Islamic revival and headscarves would be part of it. Saudis made it worse of course, but people who think Saudis invented ALL of this hv not read classical Islam..

2876 2018-10-22 18:32:55 So, you replied with a typo of your own.  Cute.  I’m not suggesting we interfere in their internal affairs.  What I AM saying is that it can’t be business as usual.  We are now a net oil exporter- they need our military hardware more than we need their oil.

2879 2018-10-22 18:32:42 All he did was put medians on the roads. How does that justify the massive borrowings of his government especially in a time of oil book and concomitant increase in FAAC allocations?
2880 2018-10-22 18:32:40 With close to 80% of people who identify as Democrats on board, the only excuse available is that they are MORE beholden to the SAME donors as Republicans, and those donors will stop at nothing to block legalization.

2896 2018-10-22 18:31:50 Exactly - no oil from Saudi Arabia.
2897 2018-10-22 18:31:38 She speaks truth. It's insane for US to partner with SA  - they spend billion$ to spread Wahhabi, extremist political Islam in an effort to wage war on the west. They are a totalitarian theocracy. Where are the real patriots who will stand up to them? Cowards beg for their oil.
2898 2018-10-22 18:31:36 Arjuna should wait a while. If these two go any lower, they are bound to strike oil.

2901 2018-10-22 18:31:02 Whether your for or against it, the approach taken is not reasonable.

Thirium is just an internal liquid. Like motor oil? Or gas? Could be used in different model types, right?

2921 2018-10-22 18:29:18 My wife has been fighting MS for almost 28 years. Cannabis oil has been the single most beneficial item to her quality of life in the last 2 years or so.

2966 2018-10-22 18:24:36 Nice! The empire continues. I went through a phase of making MCT oil mayo a while ago - just for the hype of it.  
2967 2018-10-22 18:24:35 We hear you. This is a really important issue and we’ve been driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years.  We’re on track to meet our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.
2968 2018-10-22 18:24:34 Stop playing yourself. Oil>Water in the GOP minds.
2969 2018-10-22 18:24:31 So why do you want to ruin it? Oh! Big Oil and Coal...GOP  business and $$$! OK!
2970 2018-10-22 18:24:31 So great having clean air ! Until trump tries to expand coal mines...and lower standards on automobile emmisions and drill for oil on protected coastlines
2971 2018-10-22 18:24:17 Kindly tell him that you & him are like water & oil, we just don’t mix. And then ask bartender for a glass of water, look for some salad dressing or Olive oil, and show Trumplidyte what you meant with a show...

2982 2018-10-22 18:23:25 Okay let's expand that.  Oil, and location location location.   How much do other countries use Saudi oil, where are the pipelines, and the ships going through the Suez, and how much money do the Saudis pay the US arms dealers?
2983 2018-10-22 18:23:23 Does this person also believe cigarettes are fashionable and help you stay awake when burning the midnight oil?
2984 2018-10-22 18:23:14 Hell yea. That with a lil peppermint oil and henna, curls gone be popping. Hair will be soft as hell. I started using it back in February. The best decision I’ve made for my hair EVER.

3003 2018-10-22 18:20:33 No!!! Saudi to the U.S is a job/work program. The pentagon/armed forces unused weapons are sold to the saudis. Oil coys in America need a place to drill oil. US doesn’t kiss Saudi ass in any shape or form. It’s a business decision.
3004 2018-10-22 18:20:26 I think it’s fantastic. I don’t smoke it but stupid it was illegal. I want to try CBD oil though.

3016 2018-10-22 18:19:27 It’s pretty fucked up that for years we’ve put up with their regressive ideas on sexuality and gender equality. How can you call a nation whose ideology directly conflicts with your own in almost every a valuable ally? Oh right, oil and arms deals.
3017 2018-10-22 18:19:21 I don’t care for coconut. Coconut oil, just the smell, of it makes me nauseous.

3020 2018-10-22 18:19:07 Love my shit car...low insurance, low registration fees, gas mileage freeway only is 27-29 per gallon. I check my own oil instead of trusting the car’s gauge. No weird codes because advanced tech is faulty. I’ll keep it until the wheels fall off!
3021 2018-10-22 18:19:05 The guys changing my oil keep staring at me because I’m eating chicken nuggets...

3022 2018-10-22 18:19:02 AND HELP TRUMP RAISE THE PRICE OF OIL BY HELPING THE SAUDI'S CUT OFF THEIR OIL AND RAISE THE PRICE OF GASOLINE TO $8.00 A GALLON!!!!!  THAT WOULD MAKE THE APPRENTICE TRUMP HAPPY BY TOTALLY COLLAPSING THE ECONOMY OBAMA CREATED, AND HE TOOK CREDIT FOR!!!!!

3027 2018-10-22 18:18:41 Sit in steam. Bath; shower; head over a bowl of hot water (make a tent with a towel to concentrate the steam). A nice essential oil is pleasant in the steam. This is a very steamy tweet.
3028 2018-10-22 18:18:41 This is not unplanned. The purpose being 2force Trump 2act. No matter the action taken it will be wrong. Sanction our oil supply, crash our economy. No sanction and crash the presidency. The Saudis have done nothing new here, it’s just that it is in focus begs the question, why?
3029 2018-10-22 18:18:32 What do you know about Venezuela, who want regime Change in Venezuela, and why, Destabilization of Venezuela will give have consequences on the United States. if you don't see it, it is because you are listening to your government. Oil rich Venezuela can't feed it people

3032 2018-10-22 18:18:30 Completely normal. US destabilizing all countries with oil and making excuses for that.  US should take care of their own business and respect states sovereignty.

3034 2018-10-22 18:18:00 I find it moronic that eastern Canada would rather buy oil from a country in which a journalist can be murdered, cut up and disposed of with no repercussions rather from its own country? Where do you they get their information from.. Greenpeace?
3035 2018-10-22 18:17:58 I see that I've struck oil!

What subterranean reserves there must be, to have yielded such a flow.
3036 2018-10-22 18:17:48 Most bulk freighters leak up to 50 gallons of oil per day out of their stern bearings. The oil is supposed to be biodegradable, most isn’t.
3037 2018-10-22 18:17:47 This is not about Turkey. It’s about this country supporting a country known for horrific human rights violations because they  buy our weapons and have OIL. As for this killing, there’s no denying that the Saudis planned and carried it out. Maybe 45 as well.
3038 2018-10-22 18:17:40 On the quality of Syrian oil (pls find more info w/ research) production has been traditionally low, oil from main fields is of poor quality/Sour, & expensive to refine. 

Discovery of Light/Sweet oil around #DeirEzzur changed this: scene of recent sieges & battles btwn US/SYR/IS
3039 2018-10-22 18:17:10 These people take their freedom for granted. It's been so long since we've fought a war of democracy vs oppression, they don't recognize a true threat.

9/11 was an attack by Saudis, so the GOP went to war w/Islam to keep the oil profits flowing. This is the result-ignorant fear.
3040 2018-10-22 18:17:02 I don’t know why Pakistanis moan about petrol prices. Here petrol is £1.31 a litre that’s Rs 237. You can’t say that income is high here but oil prices are same for all countries.

3051 2018-10-22 18:16:19 There are no good guys in the Middle East, only allies and enemies. Other than Israel, the SA relationship is critical. It will be impossible to sanction Iranian oil and check their terrorist activities w/o SA. Remember Arab Spring and ensuing chaos in Egypt, Syria and Libya.
3052 2018-10-22 18:16:08 I have a friend who has had serious knee pain for decades, who told me she tried CBD oil, with great results! 
3053 2018-10-22 18:16:06 Tru but noone wants to be found on the losing end. Yesterday i had to sell my US10 to get 3 cking oil 2liter bottles and got $2 change..
3054 2018-10-22 18:16:04 2/ There are MASSIVE and long standing subsidies associated with oil production and sale. What you're seeing is a shift in what the government wants to promote going forward from oil subsidies (much more significant than electric) to EV tech. Other autos are taking advantage too.
3055 2018-10-22 18:16:01 Thanks! I thought it turned out well for my first ever oil painting! Gonna do some more soon, maybe even throw in a cabin next time.

3064 2018-10-22 18:15:19 You should ask @EPAAWheeler & EPA's air head, Bill Wehrum, why they want to declare it not appropriate to reduce lead & mercury & arsenic & acid gases & toxic metals from power plants that burn coal & oil.

The rule proposal is in your White House now.
3065 2018-10-22 18:15:15 Nah but its a proof that a country sitting on oil can fail.. oil isnt everything, its loosing its importance on longterm +20y planning so theres that:) the saudis dont like it either 
3066 2018-10-22 18:15:15 Just brilliant, this is perhaps the best end to end article on the state of economy currently. Golden run is over, crude rising & CAD widening. Oil dependent Modi Govt will eventually realize its blunders & not being able to support India’s SMEs, Agriculture & Banking sector.
3067 2018-10-22 18:15:08 Cheaping out on you bro. Barrel of oil only goes for $100 on the market. A gold bar goes for $10k+

3069 2018-10-22 18:15:03 Weird, I've seen reports of migrants in some cases only deported recently, on the way back already. 
Patiently waiting, maybe, respecting the law in Mexico they say, but fully intend on illegal entry here. They are barred, even asylum, but coming anyway.

3071 2018-10-22 18:14:53 He's all about creating job, taking advantage of the natural resources in the ground, oil, mining, gas, lower crime, lower drug addiction problems. AK needs this, yesterday! @realDonaldTrump
3072 2018-10-22 18:14:14 No. But canada can put import duties on Saudi oil making it less competitive than other alternative supplies.

3076 2018-10-22 18:14:07 These assassins are sloppy in the extreme! And Theresa May insisting that “we must get to the bottom of it” is just obfuscation. You can get away with murder when you have other countries over an (oil) barrel. #C4News #Khashoggi
3077 2018-10-22 18:14:01 Nope, but that leads 2the next question being a realist. What happens if we sanction our oil supply? I have honestly never been so beside myself because the Saudis have always done such things and it was swept under. Now it is front and center begging to be dealt with, but how?
3078 2018-10-22 18:13:51 Just a reminder that Nixon in the 70’s made a deal with the Saudi’s. We guarantee their protection perpetuity for the right to trade oil only in US Dollars. Hence the Petro Dollar was born. Trading oil in Yuan’s will never happen imho for the Saudi’s.

3096 2018-10-22 18:11:33 Silence of European governors and @FedericaMog can be easily bought by sailing free oil, that Iran actually cannot sale. That's why Europe is numb about what's going on in Iran.

3099 2018-10-22 18:11:20 Why would you pick olive oil over butter?
3100 2018-10-22 18:11:13 It will definitely move up, the CBN Governor at the last MPC meeting was optimistic with the recent spike in fuel price ($80) hopefully if sustained, if the administration is giving second term, they will consolidate on the policies aimed at diversifying the economy away from oil
3101 2018-10-22 18:10:56 Okay, let’s give Saudi Arabia and Russia more money for oil
3102 2018-10-22 18:10:51 Still, I bet they are selling their oil for more than Canada.

People think there no muslim presence south of our border? 
Under the conditions present, would they be nice peace loving muslims? Likely not all, seems like a breeding ground for extremism to me.
3113 2018-10-22 18:09:53 Turks already tried that. When there was no oil just sand we died for holly lands protecting against millions of dirty crusaders. 

We gave up when our soldiers butchered by fellow Muslims searching for "gold" in our stomachs. 

They have brains let arabs decide for themselves

3117 2018-10-22 18:09:28 Well XOM do lots of shale..! But I guess they are fairly mature+diversified. Taking a punt on another (EOG) and skimming cashflow+balance sheet shows similar trends.. Swing into a profit with increased oil price >> pay down some debt >> increase capex
3118 2018-10-22 18:09:23 they're literally impossible to ruin. sure, they might rust (and they're never going to be as good for eggs as a non-stick) but all you need to take care of them is salt and oil and high heat. they're meant to be, like, thrown in the coals and stuff, and last for 100+ years!

3135 2018-10-22 18:07:39  With no thanks to you.  Due to @BarackObama’s regulatory policies, green house gas emissions decreased by 12%, production of renewable energy more than doubled, and our dependence on foreign oil was cut in half. What have you done to help with our climate change? 
3136 2018-10-22 18:07:19 Saudi acts the way it does because of the wealth created by their oil, until other countries stop buying their oil including Canada they will just carry on. One more reason to get our oil to tide water, Canada can provide an ethical alternative to Saudi oil.

3239 2018-10-22 17:58:02 Growing up I hated going to my nanny house cause she use to make me take Cod Liver Oil & robitussin if i had the slightest cough. And then she wouldn’t let me drink anything afterwards for like an hour .  i was like this is jail !!!
3240 2018-10-22 17:58:00 Are you still using palm oil in your products? Doesn't seem cruelty free if you are...
3241 2018-10-22 17:57:50 (2 of 2)...The others then pray deliverance and blessing over him, anointing him with oil, speaking the Word over him, and affirming the work of God in him.
3242 2018-10-22 17:57:49 "Oleo" means "oil" in Spanish, so now the name is super weird to me.
3243 2018-10-22 17:57:49 Please increase oil price in Delhi
3244 2018-10-22 17:57:48 Oh god i just sat here watching it an nearly ruptured one when I saw you appear.
Made my Raspberry Absolut taste that much nicer !

3245 2018-10-22 17:57:46 Just stir fried onion, garlic, chilli, chicken and cashews with Sainsbury’s stir fried veg, soy sauce and a dash of sesame oil. Quick and tasty!
3246 2018-10-22 17:57:40 anchovies can be quite intense in flavor.  Just make sure whatever you get isn't in seed oil or BAP will find you and knock them out of your hands
3247 2018-10-22 17:57:23 I've used CBD oil to deal with my CRPS for five years now and it's what keeps me off of scripts and out of a pain management office. Use as needed at the start to get it built up, I started with taking it every two hours for three days then tapered down to 3x a day. Tumeric too.
3248 2018-10-22 17:57:18 Saw a surplus of Leonard jerseys in Lucas Oil Stadium yesterday!!! #maniac
3249 2018-10-22 17:57:17 The early 1980s recession began in July 1981 and ended in November 1982 which was primarily based on the Fed's monetary policy which sought to rein in the high inflation after the 1973 oil crisis and the 1979 energy crisis. After 1982, things got a lot better for all people.
3250 2018-10-22 17:57:14 Sir build oil infrastructure of Venezuela ;than stability there ;than boycott Saudi Arabia!
3251 2018-10-22 17:57:13 sadly big talk will disappear once US can leverage increased oil production from saud. as for the turks they have many axes to grind with saudis.
3252 2018-10-22 17:57:11 Money, Oil.
3253 2018-10-22 17:57:10 Why do people put oil in a non-stick pan and then swirl it around the sides to try and coat it to stop their food sticking?
3254 2018-10-22 17:57:09 Trump imposing sanctions on Iranian oil has backfired.
3255 2018-10-22 17:57:08 Southerners say soda instead of pop.  They also don't pronounce oil.. they pronounce it ole
3256 2018-10-22 17:57:00 SELL THEM THE ARMS there will be massive financial repercussions for pulling out of the deal. STOP BUYING THE OIL FROM THEM! WE ARE AN OIL PRODUCING NATION ITS INSANE WE IMPORT OIL FROM ANYWHERE! #cdnpoli

3259 2018-10-22 17:56:50 if u mix like an egg, mayo, honey, and olive oil and keep it in ur hair for about 20 minutes (do it like once a month) it helps with hair loss!! I still lose a lot of hair but it’s not as bad as it’s been since I started to do this

Worst customer service ever continuously poor bad manner and rude #O2 #OUT #CustomerService #SouthAfrica #Training #Useless #SackThemAll #EE
3264 2018-10-22 17:56:18 Maybe it’s been their 30 constitutions in 20 years, dictators, police state, over regulation of small businesses, price controls, state controlled production too. 

Imagine having largest proven oil reserves in the world and resulting to shilling centralized shit token “Petro” 
3265 2018-10-22 17:56:12 وانا اشهد
3266 2018-10-22 17:56:11 For me it was easy to see what a load of snake oil tRump was selling and what a con man he is and I completely despise him. Of course I'll be voting Dem but I want change in this party moving forward. I applaud those not accepting Corp dollars. These people are the future!
3267 2018-10-22 17:56:09 I should’ve BEEN gave my business to Nissan. Free oil change, tire rotation, inspection, AND car wash

3270 2018-10-22 17:55:49 Remember to oil your scalp... not just your hair. It’ll keep your hair moisturized for a while
3271 2018-10-22 17:55:47 Tea tree oil for sure...I used to use the shit out of that stuff when I had my eyebrow pierced bc it was constantly infected
3272 2018-10-22 17:55:38 Sir there is enough oil produced worldwide; let Venezuela pick up the slack! boycott  Saudi Arabia!
3273 2018-10-22 17:55:35 If he wants to end himself he should jus do that without putting the precious cooking oil at risk
3274 2018-10-22 17:55:31 the wall that Mexico was supposed to be paying for and is never going to be built, you penny-ante snake-oil-hustling fraud?
3275 2018-10-22 17:55:30 I hope the oil works, because it's not inexpensive....lol.
3276 2018-10-22 17:55:05 A day without talking to you feels empty 
3277 2018-10-22 17:54:23 Yes anak, massage mo din ulo mo with efficascent oil
3278 2018-10-22 17:54:04 Thank you. Throw some of your olive oil on this prayer too.

It's going to need some good marinating before it gets to God's ears.
3279 2018-10-22 17:53:59 That's nice. I like it spicy but oil is a major put off for me.
3280 2018-10-22 17:53:55 Yeah Right..

3285 2018-10-22 17:53:27 He is not the one negotiating now is he. How is he supposed to have a position for a mess that Cameron and his group of snake oil salesmen created?
3286 2018-10-22 17:53:26 It's pouring here at my place, and I'm burning the midnight oil finishing work accompanied bg @BTS_twt #RM #Mono , I can't help feeling melancholic. #ThankYouNamjoon 
3287 2018-10-22 17:53:11 Interesting stat - for a country that doesn’t produce oil - this is mad cheap - highly subsidize. I wonder how sustainable it is
3288 2018-10-22 17:53:11 Dear Obama: #FoolMeOne_Shame OnMe Not buying your snake oil liniment any more. Beat it! #KAG 
3289 2018-10-22 17:53:01 No thanks, that means they’ll start laying ppl off out here in the oil field. 
3290 2018-10-22 17:53:00 These are fantasy role-playing names for in-game characters?
3291 2018-10-22 17:52:55 Destroying whole sovereign nations for regime change and oil access is definitely the worst. Aiding, arming with weapons, and providing fuel change assistance to Saudi Arabia to do the same in Yemen is very nearly the same.
3292 2018-10-22 17:52:50 it's white oil don't wory about it

3294 2018-10-22 17:52:41 It might change now the Chinese are buying from them but when the oil price drops so precipitously from $150 down to $40 you must expect to be hit. Look what happened to the Russian Ruble

3296 2018-10-22 17:51:56 Careless driver ......we almost lost cooking oil
3297 2018-10-22 17:51:51 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
3298 2018-10-22 17:51:51 I need some beard oil.
3299 2018-10-22 17:51:48 The Russian incident has less evidence and certainly no admission of guilt as in the SA case. Do you think it may have something to do with Oil and the Saudi dollar?
3300 2018-10-22 17:51:44 All I came for was for an oil change and air in my tires 
3301 2018-10-22 17:51:41 Dagahn's Blatta Oil
3302 2018-10-22 17:51:30 Do it!  CBD has helped me so much.  If the oil doesnt work try the balm.
3303 2018-10-22 17:51:27 When Donald Trunk realizes this it will be stopped.
Gold oil lithium and rare earths.
Who controls these controls the world
3304 2018-10-22 17:51:10 What is the US military protecting us from? It's a force that lets capitalist oppression transcend borders, and murder farmers for oil wherever America decides to. Quit bootlicking.
3305 2018-10-22 17:50:58 I’m drinking coffee for the caffeine.. you know I don’t have peppermint oil
3306 2018-10-22 17:50:33 #RT @SexAdviceBot: COSMOPOLITAN: Put your massage oil  their finger
3307 2018-10-22 17:50:13 Florida has Constitutional Revision #9 to ban vaping in the work place AND gas and oil exploration/drilling. What kind of trickery is this? The less informed may vote unknowingly against gas & oil drilling off the coast.  Insanity.
3308 2018-10-22 17:50:12 Clove oil??  ... should’ve just done the flush  #SorryForYourLoss
3309 2018-10-22 17:50:08 If the Saudis didn’t have oil, would we still be friends?
3310 2018-10-22 17:49:50 The invading hoard descends on the border and you think most Americans think this is good? I dont get why needy, poor, underpaid, lefties want more to eat out of the same bowl. 
We're not upping the food supply, so learn to share what's there.
3311 2018-10-22 17:49:49 Just leave the quart of oil on the dresser and go!
3312 2018-10-22 17:49:39 After they threatened to raise global oil prices over this. They're trying to break some world record for most laughably awful lies told ?
3313 2018-10-22 17:49:37 I need to get my car washed and a oil change
3314 2018-10-22 17:49:17 TFW you get mascara in your eye and look like you’ve got the black oil virus from the X Files... 
3315 2018-10-22 17:49:14 オイルだって、泣きたい時もある。
3316 2018-10-22 17:49:07 We cannot allow Iran control of both oil straits. Which is y Yemen.
3317 2018-10-22 17:49:05 I dont like oil
3318 2018-10-22 17:49:04 Agreed but that will not happen. No matter how often you point to "Canada does not buy oil from anyone" there will always be "You don't understand" "Canada allows...while poor AB suffers" Nothing but deflections and BS for anti-Trudeau/pro AB pipeliners. Truth is not what they do
3319 2018-10-22 17:49:00 There are downsides to both options, but i believe developing the areas where the oil revenue is being generated will go a long way compared to giving the poor the money in bits and not developing these areas.
...it looks tricky, but this options benefits them more on with time
3320 2018-10-22 17:49:00 Trading water for oil is not a good business model
3321 2018-10-22 17:48:53 Imagine paying someone to change your oil LMAO
3322 2018-10-22 17:48:53 Harvest update: I might need to be transported about in a wheelbarrow. It's not olive oil I need; it's WD40
3323 2018-10-22 17:48:36 there's a giant oil fire behind my house at an asphalt plant and it might explode so rip me ttyl guys see u on the flip side
3324 2018-10-22 17:48:32 They can't control production nor can they control delivery, great when oil is at $150 a barrel & demand outstrips supply, not so great when OPEC decides to squeeze them out of the market. Much of their oil is expensive to produce and production has been actively sabotaged
3325 2018-10-22 17:48:31 And maybe there might have been serious incentive to find alternatives to move on to & cure the addiction. No expert, but I feel the regimes are only considered 'friendly' because the price is right for both sides. We pay for the oil, they pay for the arms. Quid pro quo.
3326 2018-10-22 17:48:25 Throw the CBD out and use THC oil.. you will get high from it and probably sleep for a few days but it sounds like you need that.
3327 2018-10-22 17:48:20 ok ok ok sooooo i used clove oil to euthanize and THEN he went down the toilet  i tried to be humane!! 
3328 2018-10-22 17:47:56 Omg yes pls never use coconut oil near your face ever again bby 
3329 2018-10-22 17:47:50 How will you get Russia and China to stop burning coal and oil ???!!
3330 2018-10-22 17:47:48 Last year around 22 Oct,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3331 2018-10-22 17:47:43 Yeah!! So happy these 10 power houses are against the oil & gas industry doing business in New Mexico  Hats off to all 10! Did y’all just fall from a crazy tree?!! Have you been out to Counselor NM or Bloomfield NM?!! It’s a freaking mess!!
3332 2018-10-22 17:47:40 House of Saud is not that smart just very rich. Look at European Monarchies and the dolts they have propagated. It all comes to an end. $OIL, $GLD
3333 2018-10-22 17:47:36 Why has the 14 yr old Taylor Energy oil leak gone unreported?  And Trump wants to open up the Gulf and the Atlantic?
3334 2018-10-22 17:47:36 @ISDIN_Official es oil free?
3335 2018-10-22 17:47:34 Get one of those Yankee candle oil burners so you can get some for like £3
3336 2018-10-22 17:47:22 Hey guy I lived it please check the stats for oilfield jobs from 2014 2016 .hell look at prices of oil in that period. 35000 jobs were lost due to Saudis flooding the market. An restrictions that your great Obuma put on drilling was outrageous. Thanks to My president

3341 2018-10-22 17:46:58 Folks who are undecided about voting for Beto don’t have a brain. 
The Republicans are spending billions trashing Beto. They know he’s a decent, guy who will fight for his constituents. Can’t have that! 
Cruz fights for big oil companies - not everyday people.
3342 2018-10-22 17:46:23 @drmikehart i take a great product from Thorne that’s hemp oil that’s for sure helped my knee pain but so far not much with my crohns. What dosage should it be at? I know your tweet said 4:1 ratio right?
3343 2018-10-22 17:46:21 Why does everything vegan have coconut oil in it? Please I am so small and so hungry... please stop
3344 2018-10-22 17:46:18 Iya, sebetulnya kunci diet awal itu biar gampang batasi gula (ganti dengan Stevia), ganti garam biasa dengan Nutrisalin atau Himalayan Salt, sama ganti minyak kelapa sawit pake minyak lain. Kalau gue biasanya pakai eloo atau canola atau corn oil.

3353 2018-10-22 17:45:31 maybe massage a ton of oil/Vaseline in, then wash with soap?
3354 2018-10-22 17:45:02 Dude, we know EVERYTHING over there in terms of relationships is fluid and dirty. The issue is we can’t get off your oil. Oil is the ONLY thing that makes the Middle East relevant.

3358 2018-10-22 17:44:50 Hey my friends in WA, don't let the ads for I-1631 fool you. The ads against it are being paid for by big oil companies that don't want to pay to protect the environment & deal with climate change. Vote yes. Their ads are full of the same lies that we hear from 45. Vote yes!
3359 2018-10-22 17:44:49 @drmikehart hi there! My name is Brad Siskind and I’m a trainer who works with Gunnar Peterson at our gym in Beverly Hills. Ive had Crohn’s for 15 yrs and your last tweet has me asking some questions...is hemp oil the same as cannabis oil? Does it matter where its sourced from?
3360 2018-10-22 17:44:39 Just like offshore accommodation on oil rigs. Surprised it took so long.
3361 2018-10-22 17:44:37 Do I have to drink this essential oil just to get some sleep or
3362 2018-10-22 17:44:21 Try it! & thank me later . You season the chicken like normal but you don’t put it in flour, just put it in the oil to flash fry it. Then put your sauce on it and put it in the oven.
3363 2018-10-22 17:44:16 Awww so sorry that you believe everything this con artist and his family says. So sad people can't do their own research and blindly follow a pyshcopath. Ay least with Ivanka she doesn't have a choice but you on the other hand have one and he was your choice. Snake oil salesman!
3364 2018-10-22 17:43:54 I know Rachel your doing a great job. I really appreciate how our cheap oil is being passed onto consumers. Oil at 28$ one might expect has about .60 cents oh yeah it's $1.20. Ah just forget I brought it up
3365 2018-10-22 17:43:37 They've got loads of oil and gas per head of the population as well.
3366 2018-10-22 17:43:34 argan oil
3367 2018-10-22 17:43:27 It's a diaper rash ointment. Vitamin oil based, very thick and water resistant.
3368 2018-10-22 17:43:24 Nothing will happen to them. US and UK will still sell them guns and bombs in return for oil. The so called Useless Nations as per usual heads in the sand.
3369 2018-10-22 17:43:18 @7proudamerican Just ordered CBD oil off @TheRealHublife suggestion on his scope.  Hoping it will help my horrible arthritis in my neck.  Fingers crossed.  Just wanted you to know it wouldn't have happened without Brenden's shout out :)

3375 2018-10-22 17:42:22 More than PPP its the PPP-Haters-Cartel who is milking Bilawal’s speech, as if other 3 provinces have started drilling oil #Middle
3376 2018-10-22 17:42:02 Oil Prices rose back above $80 a barrel before dropping slightly, as markets were expected to tighten once U.S. sanctions against Iran’s crude exports are implemented next month.
3377 2018-10-22 17:41:57 Accident was a result of a hurricane. As the climate warms and storms get more intense, putting even more oil rigs in harms way is dangerous. Rather than increasing oil production, oil dependency should be reduced, looking into the future not back at the past.
3378 2018-10-22 17:41:48 nothing to say about why we are still committed to digging oil & gas from the earth when we have the possibility of endless energy for everyone from the sky & the waves? Energy. For all. Wouldn't it be good? Don't you agree, Dwight?
3379 2018-10-22 17:41:33 Remember what Saudi oil really costs
3380 2018-10-22 17:41:29 Cut in half lengthways, remove seeds, rub a bit of olive oil over it, salt and pepper, then place cut side face down on a parchment paper or aluminum foil covered cookie sheet, bake at 400 for about 45 minutes. Fluff insides with a fork and serve with spaghetti sauce of choice.
3381 2018-10-22 17:41:28 Just bought and put oil in my car while wearing my new Michael Kors heels. Don’t let anyone tell you that you can’t do it all.
3382 2018-10-22 17:41:25 They look like a magical oil painting
3383 2018-10-22 17:41:21 The fact that my car is out here scheduling it’s own oil change appointments is so egregious to me. Clearly #OnStar has no respect for the way my bank account is set up.
3384 2018-10-22 17:41:20 Hermosa Beach after the sun has set!  Lifeguard is adding oil to the Lifeguard beach truck, not just saving beautiful women and preventing having a cold beer in the sand!  Hermosa from the end of the pier!  Peace, Love & Tequila!!!
3385 2018-10-22 17:41:20 “America, go in and solve these problems! They’re your responsibility!”  /  “Hey America, get out of the middle east, you oil hungry warlords!”
3386 2018-10-22 17:41:13 Starving. Tried to make pancakes. Flipped the pancake and got hot oil all over my face, chest, and arms. This day is great.
3387 2018-10-22 17:41:08 So, all the corruption scandals never existed, all the former Lula associates that accuse him are lying? You cant be serious. Hundreds of millions of $$$ Reais were diverted from state oil company Petrobras, and given as bribes by the largest government contractors, to whom?
3388 2018-10-22 17:41:05 I’ve already voted, it was straight blue, just like every other time I’ve voted since 1996. 

In New Mexico, Republican = Oil & Gas Industry. They’ve had their time.
3389 2018-10-22 17:41:00 1) Tho I am pro drilling & mining, this wrong.
2) It seems to me one of the little guys could figure out how to skim (salavage?) that profitable oil off the water & sell it.
3) A highly risky method would be to sink a round wall around the site and pump water out to get to it.
3390 2018-10-22 17:40:58 Are you getting your oil change in the States?  Cheaper, but you have to put up with this sorta chit-chat. 
3391 2018-10-22 17:40:57 at least we didnt need oil money to become good
3392 2018-10-22 17:40:53 What the @conservatives  gave away.

3395 2018-10-22 17:40:21 The figure there is correct, some investors have cashed out of recent that has made the reserve to go down but hope the current high oil price would stem the reduction.

3398 2018-10-22 17:39:43 Goes with fiancee to get oil change so she doesn't get more than she needs done to the car.....now she's minutes from signing a new lease on a SUV... God dammit.
3399 2018-10-22 17:39:39 Na, cursed with oil....your argument is falling apart. They were rich and socialism brought them down. Simple.
3400 2018-10-22 17:39:20 Hope oil.
3401 2018-10-22 17:39:20 @POTUS use dynamite like in gold or oil mining. Just put a deep hole to keep them all out. Use US ARMY CORP OF ENGINEERS AND ACTIVE DUTY ARMY ENGINEERS. NOW.
3402 2018-10-22 17:39:07 @RepDeSantis is an empty vessel ready to be filled with oil and gas lobbyist money until he explodes from the inside.

3404 2018-10-22 17:38:44 So excited for these opportunities coming up with Oil companies.  now too chose wisely.
3405 2018-10-22 17:38:37 I am also talking in the macro version of things. So in the United States you can see overall a gender and race bias. But I can guarantee is definitely some of that going on in the oil and gas industry. Think about this, look at your bosses and their bosses. Who is in charge?
3406 2018-10-22 17:38:29 That will only pour oil on the fire

3409 2018-10-22 17:38:05 CBD Oil has changed my life.
3410 2018-10-22 17:37:59 do people still use bio oil? is it good?
3411 2018-10-22 17:37:59 must be the oil and perfume but I can always smell it on myself regardless especially in my hair
3412 2018-10-22 17:37:52 だったら祝日にして下さいよォ!!
3413 2018-10-22 17:37:47 This is inspiring me to looking into getting a horn comb for myself! I have horn flatware that I absolutely adore. Horn care tips I've read all encourage the use of oil to keep the horn healthy and from drying out, so based on that, I feel confident hair product won't hurt it?
3414 2018-10-22 17:37:40 You, obviously, do not understand the complexity of this. My own child is a trump supporter. Her sister is engaged to a poc. She does not exhibit the hatred, her friends are oil industry and police officers and she believes a lot of the rhetoric. I love her, unconditionally.
3415 2018-10-22 17:37:36 Venezuela is essentially a peasant country that has been cursed with oil & whats worse its in what the USA consider 2 be their sphere of influence. Without co-operation of all of #LatinAmerica, every regime that tries to follow a socialist path will receive the Pinochet treatment

3419 2018-10-22 17:37:09 Ok. Shut it down. The ability to illegally cross, claim speak the words " credible fear," and be released into interior, absurd.
Showing at port or illegal claiming asylum is just a workaround of the law. Needs to be ended.
3420 2018-10-22 17:37:08 Yeh! The jusroll stuff is vegan because it’s no butter. I assume so they can have longer shelf lives with oil bases etc etc
3421 2018-10-22 17:36:33 This is true. But Halliburton is not the only company out there. Sooner or later the big oil and gas industry will fade away and there will be a loss of jobs. Yes, they can hire anyone but lots of people are skeptical after the huge buy out which cause thousands of jobs.
3422 2018-10-22 17:36:27 Do you use palm oil?
3423 2018-10-22 17:36:19 TFW you're too sick to go get your CBD oil, but the reason you're too sick is because you're out of CBD oil

3425 2018-10-22 17:36:04 DH is cooking a curry tonight. Joy at this slightly mitigated by the knowledge that every pan will be used, spices will have to be sourced last minute from Tesco, hob & surrounding areas will be covered with fine misting of oil & it'll be served around 9.45pm. #NationalCurryWeek

3429 2018-10-22 17:35:33 What's the greenhouse emissions for a MW from this coal plant vs diesel engines used for many operations (eg SGR)?
Will converting to EVs and hybrids reduce our reliance on a very volatile oil price and region?
3430 2018-10-22 17:35:25 Oklahoma politics are beyond wack. There are some obvious reasons for this, like the fact that this state is a microcosmic accelerated settler colony, and the *only* thing we have stimulating our economy is oil. Voting and perpetuating that system is gonna change that.
3431 2018-10-22 17:34:26 I usually do half and half (half butter, half olive oil, not half & half the milk product)
3432 2018-10-22 17:34:25 The U.S. is friends with Saudi Arabia because:
The oil
To keep them from attacking Israel
We have Air Force bases there
3433 2018-10-22 17:34:19 You have touched on the very intent of this whole exercise.
3434 2018-10-22 17:34:13 Yes. It’s a magic oil. We love it too
3435 2018-10-22 17:34:07 CBD oil is amazing.  I use it for arthritis in my wrist and thumb.
3436 2018-10-22 17:33:57 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasTownHall
3437 2018-10-22 17:33:14 True story! Get peppermint oil onto cold rag and relax. Inhale the oil.  Pillowcases etc take meds too though lol
3438 2018-10-22 17:33:12 I came for an oil change, and an oil change only. quit trying to sell me things 
3439 2018-10-22 17:33:06 ใช่แล้ว
3440 2018-10-22 17:33:02 Gun Oil and Wet Platinum are your FRIEND. I don't know if it's available your side.
3441 2018-10-22 17:32:58 Someone connected them to Oil business abi?, hun uhn, so we rise by lifting others.
3442 2018-10-22 17:32:53 New boss doped up on dip and monster, and I know somebody in this bitch blowing an oil pen cuz I know it when I smell it 
3443 2018-10-22 17:32:49 I don't know.  Describe for me your stance on oil and vinegar?
3444 2018-10-22 17:32:48 Please Brer EU, dont force us to drop all these unprofitable videos from our platform so we can actually start making a profit now. That would be like boiling us in oil!
3445 2018-10-22 17:32:45 Why don't AAP run hybrid electric buses in Delhi please? With very lower fares. Then Oil companies will suffer huge loses. Give subsidy to all state government employees,students in metro, put restrictions no vehicles to drive or ride.
3446 2018-10-22 17:32:37 A semi autonomous state never disarmed with large parts held by Zapatistas. Some estimates put numbers in several hundred thousand, armed militia. Where you're seeing official gov LE, about as far off the beaten path as they get
3447 2018-10-22 17:32:27 coconut oil does works
3448 2018-10-22 17:32:25 The best idea ever , pour your thc vape oil on the blunt then put the weed . 
3449 2018-10-22 17:32:22 Western Canadian Select (WCS) oil is trading today at $17 per barrel. This is the price we as Canadians get for our oil. We are the worlds "Garage sale" for oil sales. Think about how this impacts government revenues, social problems or investment in our economy!
3450 2018-10-22 17:32:17 Put 4 tablespoons of baby oil in your bath water. Your skin will be silky smooth in no time.

3453 2018-10-22 17:32:06 Canned speeches do nothing for people. He is well-rehearsed about the ‘olive oil on the forehead’speech. Doesn’t say anything about his taking bribes, taxing businesses out of Florida, campaign funding from people that hate America.

3456 2018-10-22 17:32:02 Not at all surprising Saudi Arabia is walking back its oil threat. KSA is obviously a giant contributor to stable oil markets, but Riyadh needs the world to buy its oil more than the world needs Saudi crude. Without oil $ flowing in, the Kingdom would be in a world of hurt.
3457 2018-10-22 17:31:56 Iran is our nearest friendly country and Iran invited Imran first and Iran seems to provide oil on defer payment, but Imran did wrong and went to Saudia and now begging for oil deffered payment from Saudia.

3460 2018-10-22 17:31:33 I took CBd oil for the first time in a while and it was too much.
3461 2018-10-22 17:31:29 I'm laughing my brains out right now. I was looking up the word "anoint" to see what it means today. Do you know what it said? It said, ..."to smear or rub with oil as in a religious ceremony"
To smear? you got to be kidding me!
Is that the best word they could come up with?
3462 2018-10-22 17:31:28 Я тебе что Билли Миллиган, что ты со мной на "вы"?
3463 2018-10-22 17:31:03 Yep! Skin gets really crispy too. They don't change the fry oil once service starts so it carries over the numbing pepper from their fried numbing pepper chicken too if you order it a few hours after they've started service.
3464 2018-10-22 17:31:02 Y’all know the tweet about somebody’s daughter needing an oil change.. I still haven’t gotten an oil change. Lmao
3465 2018-10-22 17:30:56 They really need to band together. Trump wants to end all treaties. He wants their land. He doesnt care if its sacred or not. He wants to drill drill drill and give big oil what they want.
3466 2018-10-22 17:30:51 I support the use of Canadian oil only, but sorry to say not for the reasons you mention! Global warming  is and has for millions of years been a natural phenomonon! Our Canadian economy will accomplish absolutely nothing in pumping our hard earned money into this U.N. farce !!!!
3467 2018-10-22 17:30:50 Still not good enough to ensure no animals are harmed for me I’m afraid. Plus you still use palm oil! 

Big ‘ol nope from me!
3468 2018-10-22 17:30:48 You won’t want all that oil you claim is yours then .  (cheap joke but could not resist it )  even a lots of renewables havea big impact on the environment once we all start driving electric cars it will create another massive problem for us .
3469 2018-10-22 17:30:48 The human race is DOOMED!! We too in time will become endangered The sooner the better this planet implodes! after all Oil & Gas extraction, Fracking & pollution we don't deserve EARTH! 
Not to mention the constant warring, Death and suffering inflicted upon our very selves!!

3474 2018-10-22 17:30:26 Why is no one talking about the oil spilling in the gulf of Florida for years! Not weeks. If you can not responsibly pull oil out of the ocean then leave the oil alone. Look at the mess now polluting the oceans.  We are the stewards of our planet.
3475 2018-10-22 17:30:21 How stupid do they think we are?  @realDonaldTrump stupid, or we are just some complicit, compliant, colluding, person who will do anything to protect our interests in oil and campaign monies. Oh. Never mind. I just answered it! @AP please stay on this story!
3476 2018-10-22 17:30:15 All said 
3477 2018-10-22 17:30:14 We offer them aid for oil.
3478 2018-10-22 17:30:13 By any chance is any of this about oil? I haven’t checked but it’s good to ask since it seems to drive so much of our political bs these days
3479 2018-10-22 17:30:11 after cotton seed next invention oil from grass 
3480 2018-10-22 17:29:44 They are all excellent snake oil salesmen
3481 2018-10-22 17:29:43 The oil addiction started when Moses discovered paraffin in the Sinai.
3482 2018-10-22 17:29:39 In a regular month, our commercial kitchen would use 10l or so, but we do use other types of oil as well. In my house 2l would last me more than a month, even when I cook doughnuts lol
3483 2018-10-22 17:29:38 Because when Hugo Chavez was in power he hated the US and capitalism when he transition the country into socialism to gain control of the oil.
3484 2018-10-22 17:29:36 we have transformed from holding a Beggars Bowl to buying Russian missiles,iran oil, and humongous infrastucture development which was unthinkable few years back, now as financialy sound country and our strenghth in unity India will achieve everytihing a true Indian can dream of
3485 2018-10-22 17:29:31 Funny you should say that....quite possible Saudi #BigLong funds pouring in via iShare ETFs were what inflated #EnergyDominance oil bubble from 29/6/2017. (Mecca) clue to Saudi could even be in the Black Rock name.....
3486 2018-10-22 17:29:22 ROAST BEEF SANDWICH WITH WALNUT ROMESCO; medium rare roast beef, walnut romesco ( walnuts, chili, garlic, paprika and olive oil) roasted green peppers and garlic mayonnaise in toasted ciabatta w/ salad $11.00

3490 2018-10-22 17:29:04 The Saudi regime is no better or worse than has ever been. It has always been a backward tyranny This did not just happen last week. They have and will remain a strong western ally as long as we depend on oil and Iran is also a nutcase theocratic nation also.(wrong sort it seems)
3491 2018-10-22 17:29:02 It tasted like the photo of Sichuan Chile oil on ice cream looks, with a hit of lime. WONDERFUL.
3492 2018-10-22 17:28:44 What about Chidambaram's wife & son? Every politician does the same rotten tactics when they come to power. All FM are same for us. Never think for the country. Now govt has learnt to generate revenue through Oil. So much reluctant to promote electric cars.

It's not too hard to fix the damage done to our cookbooks.

3508 2018-10-22 17:27:24 I mean olive oil is great and all, but eggs in olive oil is unthinkable.
3509 2018-10-22 17:27:20 @realDonaldTrump @GOP You are lying and inaccurate. What I see are many families with children in this caravan.NOT angry mobs. Cutting off assistance to these  poor countries will make the situation worse! (Instead of threats, deal w the Major oil spill happening)
3510 2018-10-22 17:26:57 Like I said socialism has failed everywhere...presently Venezuela, once a ver rich oil country. Starving in Cuba. Name a success. People will not work to give away the fruits of their labourto others. Why should they...socialism is akin to slavery.

3512 2018-10-22 17:26:44 Icebergs are natural.

3513 2018-10-22 17:26:42 forced into the depressing hellhole of the mall because the wait for an oil change where i went originally was 2 hours long smh
3514 2018-10-22 17:26:42 Me and sneaking is like oil and water. Especially since they'll be looking for me specifically.
3515 2018-10-22 17:26:39 The problem the modern food enthusiasm is asking for more Oil to cook them.tablesppon oil now became big jar full of it for frying.
3516 2018-10-22 17:26:37 Thank you cuz I use honey and olive oil
3517 2018-10-22 17:26:36 It reminds me of an oil painting of European aristocracy!
3518 2018-10-22 17:26:35 Yes I will be documenting my first time doing CBD oil today. It isn't too bad right now
3519 2018-10-22 17:26:32 You MUST try Aloe Vera gel along with essential face oils. Trust me it does wonders for dry skin. I’ve been using the geranium essential oil with castor and olive oil, & it’s made my skin so much better that I don’t even apply foundation/BB cream anymore!
3520 2018-10-22 17:26:29 Takis are vegan, I think they are palm oil free as well... my husband loves them

3523 2018-10-22 17:26:24 @lukoilengl good day, we are asking if Litasco Middle East can supply oil in Beira Port in Mozambique n we also need to know the procedures and the way forward...
3524 2018-10-22 17:26:22 I have this problem to sometimes, try also vitamin E oil all over your face at night before bed. 
3525 2018-10-22 17:26:20 If you'd rather live on your friends couch than with me you can learn how to check your own oil or have your friends help you. I'm your sister, not your service station.
3526 2018-10-22 17:26:18 Why can't we shut down the oil well that pumping oil into the gulf. BP oil is responsible for the repair. Its been dumping oil 24hrs a day since the platform was damage. Fix it
3527 2018-10-22 17:26:18 Norwegians have oil — Let’um pass.
3528 2018-10-22 17:25:59 85% of America's global economy is powered by oil & gas & coal. Our #RFID tags are made to tolerate the harsh conditions of these fields.
3529 2018-10-22 17:25:59 Getting everything I need done early. Got my oil changed, getting my car washed, going home to start homework, and then gonna clean my room and start packing!
3530 2018-10-22 17:25:58 Branch offices of Lab'n'Tories moaning about secrecy and transparency, you couldn't make that up could you? Ask the London exchequer to open the books, Scotland was a net contributor before oil was discovered. Yet still the lies and deceit regarding Scotland's economy.
3531 2018-10-22 17:25:42 I remember I was getting my oil changed, dude saw my Panthers seat covers and started telling about the Fred Lane story. He knew his wife, crazy stuff

3534 2018-10-22 17:25:33 the problem is trump annoyed the other major cheap oil country :/

Its sell them weapons or limited oil
3535 2018-10-22 17:25:32 Like Canada, and the EU, and the UK, and the OAS? Or just the ones that have tons of oil and know how to kiss ass?
3536 2018-10-22 17:25:21 The Irving oil refinery and natural gas explosion this month were the warning from the deities and the angels to sent the messages to the Canadian government to slow down or stop taking out the oil and gas, because the country will face the huge earthquake
3537 2018-10-22 17:25:11 I recommend 3 products and with the math it puts you slightly over budget but this is all you need. 1.) Charcoal Acne Cleanser (to get rid of oil/dirt on the surface), 2.) Charcoal Acne Scrub to really cleanser deep beneath the top layer of skin. Both products are made by Biorè
3538 2018-10-22 17:25:09 Yeah ok, piss off one of our major allies that we need in the region to promote decent oil prices..... oh that’s right while you were pretend Vietnam we had gas shortages....
3539 2018-10-22 17:24:59 His blatant LIES have heated up and he is doing the only thing he enjoys: campaigning. Thinks he’s  a pop star. How could anyone in their right mind believe this snake oil salesman?
3540 2018-10-22 17:24:45 I will gladly take his money for the texts I got.
Let us know if this is granted class action status.
3541 2018-10-22 17:24:37 They’re already roasted in some olive oil sis
3542 2018-10-22 17:24:33 Canada is carbon neutral! Our oil, gas and related petroleum industries are international leaders in carbon emissions. Simple facts the climate/weather alarmists fail to mention. And carbon taxes fail to reduce emissions. Look west to BC to see the failure
3543 2018-10-22 17:24:20 The reason #saudis rat family is  spending billions of the people’s money, demonising #iran (who have no history of terrorism) is to avoid the fate #ghaddafi had met, they should know the day Iran comes in their oil won’t spare them, and they will be eliminated @SaudiEmbassyUSA
3544 2018-10-22 17:24:14 Feeling a sneeze while oil pulling is a nightmare.
3545 2018-10-22 17:24:09 You folks that use palm oil to fry potato chips are one of the many things wrong with the world. Not just global warming, not just trump, not just civil Wars.
3546 2018-10-22 17:24:09 But still not palm oil FREE ? Naaa that’s just pretentious as fuck you claim cruelty free but the use of palm oil still affects orangutans, sun bears, some rhinos , Sumatran tigers and Bornean elephants so please explain the “CRUELTY FREE” part please?!!
3547 2018-10-22 17:24:07 You don`t want to know...   She started a pop up shop selling motorbike parts.  There *might* be oil stains on the floor.  It smells.
3548 2018-10-22 17:24:00 Obama did nothing as police injured water protectors in #StandingRock. He supported pipelines. Obama removed the rules that prevented selling oil/gas overseas, which is what is fueling the #fracking boom. Yes renewable energy is the future but Democrats are not investing in it.
3549 2018-10-22 17:23:59 The best thing about having braids is being able to oil my scalp regularly
3550 2018-10-22 17:23:48 He is a slimy snake oil salesman, why do people like him?

3553 2018-10-22 17:23:12 Gotta be more than that... As far as I can see - and I could very well be wrong - we sell £3bn worth to them. Surely this isn't enough to warrant this level of help. Oil? Debt bonds..? Cupboard skeletons..? I read they bailed Chump out...
3554 2018-10-22 17:23:08 The Saudis are buying shipping ports......and land grab is for pipeline for Chinese Oil interests.
3555 2018-10-22 17:22:58 Copaiba oil is great.  I use it daily.

3558 2018-10-22 17:22:28 Exactly! Thank youuu. When our oil or check engine light comes on our cars, we keep going. Planes stop dead in their tracks and fix it then and there. They can’t afford to make mistakes.
3559 2018-10-22 17:22:23 Note to self: ONE drop of peppermint essential oil in my coffee is MORE THAN ENOUGH 
3560 2018-10-22 17:22:17 They are going to start building a facility next year if they get funding. This will enable them to buy oil from anyone. Won’t be operational until 2023
3561 2018-10-22 17:22:17 Hello. Farmer here
3562 2018-10-22 17:22:14 Let the Chips fall where they may.  Fall/Winter is a good time to have this situation.  Thinking we have no need for their oil!
3563 2018-10-22 17:22:13 My small business has jumped to twice the profit from when Obama was in, he made a better trade deal with Mexico and Canada.  Steel workers back to work, coal mines open, biggest supplier of oil in world. You are purposely not seeing it, but the rest of us know it’s true.
3564 2018-10-22 17:22:11 Oil billionaires....been doing they're way
3565 2018-10-22 17:22:08 My parents got me two new tires and an oil change for my birthday. Being an adult is great
3566 2018-10-22 17:22:03 I used to see both angels and demons as a kid. When we moved into our house that’s when I started seeing them and then that’s when my dad started putting anointment oil on my forehead

3570 2018-10-22 17:21:48 It’s a pump and dump company that pays him that’s why he owe himself the money. Trump has been doing this for years. He is the snake oil salesman/ con artist his base are clueless about, trump have them totally conned, they think he is a legit businessman.
3571 2018-10-22 17:21:33 Thanks. Companies with grasping/greedy CEOs/boards always use rules/regs/intimidation to secure market share - even if product is superior. Many tech cos are ‘natural monopolies’
See late 1800s railroad, oil. Sherman Anti-Trust Act. We learn nothing from history.

3575 2018-10-22 17:21:21 Why are we so tight with saudi anyhow? Oh yeah oil. The way they treat their people is no better than the others in the middle east that we denounce.

Slowly add the milk.

3591 2018-10-22 17:20:24 Hi Erin. Apparently Van Dyck did numerous small oil sketches of his subjects and they are wonderful.

3594 2018-10-22 17:19:37 Uhhhhhhhh........ it has been a Republican wet dream to do the bidding of big health insurance companies and get rid of 1)protections for preexisting conditions and 2) eliminate the EHBs

They're selling snake oil to folks w/ Cancer.  It's fucking sick.
3595 2018-10-22 17:19:35 Mine is worse when wax builds up. Regular use of Olive oil helps loosen it and hopefully the noise gets less. Or is it wishful thinking?

3645 2018-10-22 17:14:28 I steam every three weeeks with it ,been trying to find the perfect oil to pair it with and Coconut oil hasn’t actually been helpful(most overrated oil) so yes olive oil it is,Harmattan in Sokoto is no joke ,I’ve been here for so long and I think I’m just getting a hang of it .
3646 2018-10-22 17:14:21 An oil spill in our waters will be a job killer.  Not worth the chance.
3647 2018-10-22 17:14:03 Oscar, you must work for Oil and Gas or ICE companies...
3648 2018-10-22 17:14:01 This man said I was supposed to come get a oil change 5000 miles ago

3661 2018-10-22 17:13:05 No oil constraints with Saudis just even worst Trump/Putin constraint...
3662 2018-10-22 17:13:05 As you know, I forecast in 2012, (based on my #BigLong thesis of persistent US macro manipulation) & when price was >$110/bbl, that when Fed QE ended oil price would fall to $45 to $50/bbl.
3663 2018-10-22 17:13:04 Farming is the new oil
3664 2018-10-22 17:12:57 @SBakerMD I loved the podcast you did with @JREpodcast and am now two weeks into doing a modified version where my diet consists of eggs red meat avocados & olive oil (for added fats) which has kept me into a DEEP state of ketosis. If you don't mind me asking what are ur thoughts
3665 2018-10-22 17:12:40 "Let’s get in on the ground. There is a lot of money to be made in the future in Libya. Lot of oil to be produced. Let’s get on the ground and help the Libyan people establish a democracy and a functioning economy based on free market principles."

Do you agree with Putin or POTUS with regards to the Iran deal?

Do you agree with Putin or POTUS with regards to the Paris Accords?

Fact Check 
USA produced more oil than Russia for the first time since 1999!
3673 2018-10-22 17:12:09 I change my oil nigga
3674 2018-10-22 17:12:06 Hahahaha that’s funny. Come to Calgary and poll the oil patch here and find out who they are voting for. Give you a hint, it isn’t the band of clueless socialists.
3675 2018-10-22 17:12:02 getting an oil change and I’m high key thinking about smoking behind Walmart LOL
3676 2018-10-22 17:12:00 I watched some of the clips from the FL governor debate. Don't think I've fully recovered from Gillum mentioning blessing oil on a political stage.

3687 2018-10-22 17:10:57 The Saudis are a medieval society. The interactions we have with them have  not made them a better society. We are worse off because the contact encourages US greed.
We can buy oil from other countries and sell arms elsewhere also. We don’t have to be dependent on them.
3688 2018-10-22 17:10:55 What essential oils did you use abeg? I only have menthol and eucalyptus oil? Help needed, it's allergy season.

3691 2018-10-22 17:10:30 When a nation of laws, morals, and values is tolerant of friends who so casually violate those ethos, what does it say about us. This “relationship” is based on fear and it’s mostly one way. Because of oil, it’s more like a junkie and dealer.  Don’t forget the Saudi role in 9/11.

3693 2018-10-22 17:10:14 Informing patients about omega-3s differences is helpful. Flaxseed vs fish oil omega-3s are not the same. The conversion of the omega-3s in flaxseed to EPA/DHA is very poor. #FNCE #omega3
3694 2018-10-22 17:10:12 Well atm I can’t really say, I was on this medication that dried out my hair and skin so I’m on maximum water+oil

3697 2018-10-22 17:09:42 Putting it like that, I now almost wonder if competing oil companies pay people to protest against competing companies. Sadly, people don't do anything anymore unless there's something in it for them.

3706 2018-10-22 17:08:49 Doesn’t the dirty oil come from Alberta in the form of tar sands?
3707 2018-10-22 17:08:49 Yea: party Jollof just took over but palm oil rice really was the queen
3708 2018-10-22 17:08:29 Oil assets are greater are they? Tell us how many acres/sq km Angs has versus UKOG. Good luck. UKOG have a much larger area, and over time have the potential for wells with a much larger contact into the Weald oil reserves.
3709 2018-10-22 17:08:12 Such cravings cannot be tolerated ..hakuna cooking oil..

3712 2018-10-22 17:07:43 Cause we can’t afford to feed the kids real soup, today. Now shut up and drink your oil.

3715 2018-10-22 17:07:16 Fuck these people too. The last time this happened b/c people, with the help of shady banks, tried to overextend themselves when they knew damn well they couldn’t afford a house. The banksters need their bumpkins in order to sell their snake oil. Can’t just blame pols/bankers.
3716 2018-10-22 17:07:15 Where do the get the money to buy gas, oil, parts, food, shelter, etc etc?
3717 2018-10-22 17:07:13 Nelson should be leading by 20 points. Rick Scott is just another GOP Corrupted 1% - selling out America to the highest bidder...  so far, its the NRA and the Big Oil Companies.

3723 2018-10-22 17:06:50 Amendment 74 is a method for oil and gas companies to get paid billions from our schools. It is not for you and protecting your property, it is a limitation on our states ability to self regulate. It is TABOR 2.0
3724 2018-10-22 17:06:45 Change you oil ma’am
3725 2018-10-22 17:06:40 Where were you when they said Masqurade stuff can generate a million jobs? If "he" said this madam,He can say anything.If they can say they would regulate oil prices, they can say they would attack Israel. Under APC govt. Anything is "SAYABLE" sai baba.

3727 2018-10-22 17:06:27 If whenever it rains and the cold breeze makes you think of sex rather than sexy sweet sleep then you should drink anointed oil everyday!
3728 2018-10-22 17:06:25 My God!  Why does beautiful queen smell like coconut oil and berries. Sheesh sis. So enticing and indulge worthy!!

3731 2018-10-22 17:05:41 Ofcourse they would wanna sign a fossil hoping to get oil.
3732 2018-10-22 17:05:37 india me sab se zada oil par VAT delhi  me hai lekin kejriwal 80,000 hazar ka darupineke liye vat kam nehi karega
3733 2018-10-22 17:05:33 Or it was depending on oil exports to fund the implementation of those policies & then the market was flooded with cheap oil, which undermined the economy. Which purely by chance, was the intention of the Saudis, who flooded the market to undermine their competitors.
3734 2018-10-22 17:05:32 When oil price is increasing, state's earning on tax on oil is increasing. Let government freeze their tax part per litre to relief poor.

3737 2018-10-22 17:05:09 Oh I understand try mixing after idk how many years I have to mix castor, coconut, flaxseed and Morocco oil. The washing thing depends how much oil your hair natural produces
3738 2018-10-22 17:05:01 Loss-loss scenario anyway. Artificial downward movement on oil prices creates oversupply + producer profit loss - consumer growth = energy diversification; artificial supply strain + producer profits - consumer anger = energy diversification #oilpolitics
3739 2018-10-22 17:04:58 Allah ya yassare mana al'amura
3740 2018-10-22 17:04:53 Not With Saudi Oil. And Saudi 
Besties.
3741 2018-10-22 17:04:42 does anyone have an oil tank and know how to turn the heat on lol
3742 2018-10-22 17:04:35 Yep. Any country that expanded their welfare state under socialist presidents and promised to return the wealth from places like United Fruit Company or other agricultural and oil barons were overthrown by US-backed right wing death squads.
3743 2018-10-22 17:04:30 But it's ok to keep buying oil from them?
3744 2018-10-22 17:04:27 Nothing is stopping countries from selling oil for less than the currently listed prices. 
Iran could sell to India for $10 less than another country if they wanted.
3745 2018-10-22 17:04:20 That's sadcooking oil....damn
3746 2018-10-22 17:04:19 "On average, 330,000 gallons of crude are spilled each year in Louisiana from offshore platforms and onshore oil tanks"

Friend: You are so weird...

Me: Thanks
3748 2018-10-22 17:04:18 La destruccion tiene décadas, para q ocurra una intervención se necesita dinero(alguna forma de negocio) y un tipo de organización que maneje masas y mientras sigan pagando cash el oil seguirá la parranda y más ahora q viene la subida de precios q han aguantado x 2 años.
3749 2018-10-22 17:04:18 You could say that about your beloved oil city and chequebook pep! Outclassed by Lyon and very lucky to scrape past Hoffenheim
3750 2018-10-22 17:04:16 CBD oil should help. Might take a few days.

3753 2018-10-22 17:04:09 I am one of them. Without CBD oil I would not be able to sleep due to hot flashes and insomnia. I don’t have any interest in being stoned. I won’t smoke the flower. I need the edibles.
3754 2018-10-22 17:04:02 For years the Saudis have used @GOP Republicans to make Americans think they're Patriots

They controlled @FoxNews using @Alwaleed_Talal's Oil wealth to convince idiots that Climate Change isn't real

They made you think Iran was evil

I'll #VoteBlue to rid these Murdering Conmen
3755 2018-10-22 17:04:00 Sadly, It is rampant in Kenya too. From drawing oil from tankers at accident scenes to consumables, caring less for human life

3757 2018-10-22 17:03:40 You will need: 3tbsp shea butter , 3 tbsp coconut oil, 3 tbsp arrowroot powder, 3tbsp biocarbonate of soda and 15 drops of essential oil of your choice. Mix the shea butter and coconut oil together in a bowl, add the biocarbonate of soda and arrowroot then the essential oils.
3758 2018-10-22 17:03:28 Hahaha kannn matiii. Tea tree oil tu asing. Try p tgk we. Aku pakai seaweed ni mcm ok. Xla minyak boleh goreng teloq hahahaha
3759 2018-10-22 17:03:15 I just watched the highlight pack for the Oil/Preds game the other night. It was the Nashville feed. At one point, he called Lucic "The Mountain Man - Milan Lucic". 
3760 2018-10-22 17:03:10 With oil controlled by the market no govt can survive. See the last 40 years of right wing control. Let’s get stable money and get govt to save the royalties like it should be.
3761 2018-10-22 17:03:04 he oil was too sweet, for me, so i added Crown 
3762 2018-10-22 17:03:00 Still tryna figure out why my oil change cost a bill
3763 2018-10-22 17:02:59 Big Oil will never quit trying to squeeze another couple of pennies from their competitors.
3764 2018-10-22 17:02:59 Laughable claim in @axios about Big Oil's opposition to carbon pricing. BP, et al, are throwing $20 million against WA state 1631 ballot initiative, @AmyAHarder opines, uh, reports, because it "exempts ... other sectors." Not, mind you, because it threatens Big Oil's bottom line.
3765 2018-10-22 17:02:56 Toyota Vits where do you check transmission oil?
3766 2018-10-22 17:02:56 Hope oil eh snobber ka nga diyan
3767 2018-10-22 17:02:56 In another life I did some offshore work in the Gulf of Mexico for big oil... this news caught me by surprise
3768 2018-10-22 17:02:55 can i make scrambled eggs with zero oil lol probably not.
3769 2018-10-22 17:02:42 Except most oil patch people I know are saying to me they are planning on voting NDP.

3772 2018-10-22 17:02:13 -our skin try to overcome the dryness by producing more oil so kulit kita tak kering, but bila oil berlebihan,pores akan senang tersumbat and thats why timbul tiny bumps and pimple.
3773 2018-10-22 17:02:02 Hahah ohh okay jugak harga tu. Haritu cari tea tree oil tu dgn 2 benda lagi. Trial kit. Rm200+ hahah kecik tet
3774 2018-10-22 17:01:48 Because the no campaign is financed by big oil and they are spending a lot to defeat this measure. #YesOn1631
3775 2018-10-22 17:01:47 I notice it is dry out my scalp. I probably need to combine it with another oil.
3776 2018-10-22 17:01:43 It’s all about the people of the U.K. not just the 17.4 million who were sold snake oil by your rich backers!
3777 2018-10-22 17:01:39 I can’t wait to go get my food  Imma be broke ash since i had to get an oil change but fuck it I’m hungry
3778 2018-10-22 17:01:29 So that’s 78 countries and 750 deals, many of them multilateral, to replicate, agree, & ratify by 29 March. How many negotiators do we have? When do they start? Hope they’ve got plenty of black coffee and midnight oil.  And a star-trek transporter. And a time-machine.
3779 2018-10-22 17:01:06 WTI right now is just over 69USD/bbl. Western Canadian Select is selling at just over 17USD/bbl. That is a 52USD/bbl delta. The US imports about 130,000,000 per month of Canadian oil.     

That is about USD225,000,000 per day difference.

Or about 300,000,000 Canadian $/day lost

3781 2018-10-22 17:00:59 @TheRealHublife Hey Brenden, I don't think I'm following Robin, but I heard your sponsorship on your periscope today and just ordered the CBD oil you help up on your scope for my arthritis.  Let her know that I ordered.
3782 2018-10-22 17:00:58 if you rinse well no in doubt avoids oily oils like olive oil, a cooking oil (not used xD) will do the job very well ^^

3785 2018-10-22 17:00:56 IMO Mark I'd say don't sweat it cuz a lot of girls will basically reduce themselves to objects for money. Just read up on what the life of those oil princes is like, it's uncanny and bizarre - not a place I want to be but some people are really into it.
3786 2018-10-22 17:00:55 i always mix baby oil and lotion, skin be soft
3787 2018-10-22 17:00:54 so much data on supply yet so many indicators showing a serious slow down in demand worldwide being either overlooked or buried/down played between the bullish oil news... Why is that and who benefits as the facts are out there...
3788 2018-10-22 17:00:53 je vous parle de médias gérés par des gens qui en ont rien à fiche du coût du gas oil... cela pose problème mais bon peut être suis je trop regardant sur leur petites méthodes et je me fais un film

3791 2018-10-22 17:00:28 It is not going to be more than it's all time high for the next 3-4 years..and no point in investing in a high valuation stock..which is linked to a commodity..crude oil in this case

3800 2018-10-22 16:59:56 if you use oil it would match again in 6 weeks   
3801 2018-10-22 16:59:52 Oil from your hair will get onto your pillowcase as you sleep, so change your pillowcases weekly to avoid sleeping on oil all night long.
3802 2018-10-22 16:59:43 I once heard a story of a girl who grew with her stepmother but she would not allow her to use Vaseline Bambi nga she could use cooking oil to apply on her body to go to school. I swear some things women do make you say I wish I wasn't a woman. Some things are very a shaming.
3803 2018-10-22 16:59:20 “Aggressively address lead issues” for the Trump EPA also means declaring it not appropriate to cut lead from power plants that burn coal & oil, & repealing limits on lead pollution from 100s of different types of industrial polluters. 

EPA’s spin report ignores both.

3807 2018-10-22 16:59:01 That’s why I’m asking though. He covered up the murder. He couldn’t have been more obvious. I mean he gave interviews 

So why? I thought he wasn’t a globalist? Why is he covering for oil barons across the world?
3808 2018-10-22 16:59:01 Lol especially the curly hair! I been teaching her about the right products to use.  She think she got the hair she can just throw up and call it a day. Lol I’m like no babygirl we gotta oil u up and lay ur edges  baby hairs are so important lol
3809 2018-10-22 16:58:50 Time to build a pipeline and stop buying Saudi oil.
3810 2018-10-22 16:58:49 I do those. My issue is with finding the right oil for me, so far I’ve tried castor oil and coconut oil mostly and also they want me to wash my hair every week!
3811 2018-10-22 16:58:49 GOP trying to sell you snake oil don't buy it it's poison.
3812 2018-10-22 16:58:33 I gather that most CBD oil sold over the counter contains very little CBD to be effective for pain relief.  Whatever the source, CBD is not psychoactive.
3813 2018-10-22 16:58:29 In these times where it seems to be our countries darkest hour do you trust someone who appears t be handing out love? Or has the Snake Oil Salesman Changed his colors?
3814 2018-10-22 16:58:28 This what I really need. Some oil !!
3815 2018-10-22 16:58:17 Breaks my heart.  This is so wrong so unnecessary and can be stopped.  Bureau of Land Management has been corrupted by special interests (cattle ranchers and oil and gas executives) and the mustangs are paying the price.  So are all Americans who want them protected.

3823 2018-10-22 16:57:36 Pls don’t get me wrong it’s great that brands are not tested on animals and vegan. But palm oil harvesting is environmentally destructive and it also results in the killing of animals and destruction of their habitats and therefore by default, is also cruel in itself.

3830 2018-10-22 16:57:14 Saudi didn't crash price. It fell when Fed cut QE liquidity supporting market so enabling shale oil to free US from Saudis. Once Saudi realised Obama had shafted them they began putting oil proceeds into Euro debt. This #PetroEuro is why ECB brought forward € QE to Jan 2015.
3831 2018-10-22 16:57:13 Yeah right! U run a misogynistic autocratic religious dictatorship and u just killed a foreign journalist in your consulate on foreign soil! Your whole mask has been torn down by this and I am sure #LyingMBS knew about this! Hope your regime falls with drying oil...
3832 2018-10-22 16:57:02 Don’t understand what their saving with electric cars still have to use lots of oil to create electricity also it takes more oil to make Solar panels then their benefits just makes no sense
3833 2018-10-22 16:57:01 It can also be made from water, employing nuclear fusion. The question is where the energy comes from and pipeline efficiency. Already installing solar is cheaper than digging coal or drilling oil. If photosynthesis is in the pipeline, efficiency drops 1000x.

3842 2018-10-22 16:55:37 In fact, at least to the public eye, especially to the left public eye, they're not. A radical muslim is a person, robbed of his land. We drill for oil in their lands and the afghans, iraqis and iranis, have a just cause. Neo nazis are just dirt.
3843 2018-10-22 16:55:26 Surprisingly productive! 2 mike walk, oil change & tire rotation, grocery shopping, visits with former coworkers, mixed up some homemade mix recipes, had lunch (forgot breakfast),caught up on a couple of DVRd shows. Now to clean! Boring but productive! 
3844 2018-10-22 16:55:21 wouldn't oil clog pores?
3845 2018-10-22 16:55:18 At least Henry VIII ( aided and abetted by that minx Anne Boleyn), rid us of the then, all powerful Catholic Church. This lot are given licence to do as they wish because of oil, and the sychophantic war criminals who sell arms to them.
3846 2018-10-22 16:55:08 When you find out you can extract oil from acorns
3847 2018-10-22 16:55:02 It is refined from our own crude oil. Please explain how gas is at the current price.
3848 2018-10-22 16:54:58 I agree! I’ve been trying to understand how to remain a Palm oil conscious household. But I’m confused because info is so conflicting. Reports differ on brands. And some brands are vegan and cruelty free but still contain palm oil which is confusing and surely you can’t be both?

3852 2018-10-22 16:54:14 I read about the issues with Red and followed the advice people gave: shaved down the thigh pegs a bit and used shock oil. They rotate without much of an issue. There were also issues with Black & Yellow's neck joint. Had to shave them down on the sides in order to fit properly.
3853 2018-10-22 16:54:12 I get mine from BioLief! I use the 800mg CBD drops and I just started using their CBD Vaping Oil. I love it! Let me know if you would like to look at the link!
3854 2018-10-22 16:54:01 (Meaning) Take it from the old people with oil money behind them at Heritage - black people shouldn’t feel like college is an option and it was a mistake to allow them to vote.
3855 2018-10-22 16:53:59 i do not feel like celebrating the fact an enormous new oil field is being split open like a toxic coconut
3856 2018-10-22 16:53:56 Stop buying their oil
3857 2018-10-22 16:53:54 Plus an oil
3858 2018-10-22 16:53:54 Of course they won't!  U.S. only uses 9% oil from Saudi Arabia. No big deal!

3872 2018-10-22 16:52:58 It seemed bizarre that while American military protects the EU, yes under NATO, Germany purchases their energy from the very country that may attack. Additionally, the world has watched Russia use their oil as an economic weapon against others dependent on them.

- Powell needs to pause for 6 months here. Consumer spending is heavy in Q4 and then drop off cliff in Jan/Feb

3891 2018-10-22 16:50:54 25 years is a long period. A lot has happened. In order to deduce the events directly responsible for the decline in total oil production in Africa, it is important to review the trend. A chart of  world/Africa production V time (per Quarter) would be quite useful.
3892 2018-10-22 16:50:49 There’s two type of cologne one is oil base and one just the water base. Oil base last longer (like all day until you took a shower) water base is just the old fashion cologne.

3894 2018-10-22 16:50:25 Isn't it funny how the unread protester demographic is always fighting against new pipelines, but not advocating for decommissioning existing ones?

It's almost as if they know that oil is necessary, but won't admit it.
3895 2018-10-22 16:50:17 Hi Lynn, I don't know if this can help you. For me, whenever I have a headache, I take some coconut oil and add a few drops of peppermint, lavender and frankencense and apply it to the base of my neck and temples a few times a day to get relief.

3900 2018-10-22 16:50:09 Norway has an oil fund over 1 trillion. It earns more than their oil does now. Where is the UKs? Where is Scotland's? It's not credible to argue N sea assets have been managed well. Scotland can follow Norway's example. All talk of deficits is laughable in this context.
3901 2018-10-22 16:50:08 Yep, Doesn't help that the entire food industry is built around it either

It's extremely hard for an average person to avoid grains and vegetable oil when eating out.

They're in everything
3902 2018-10-22 16:50:03 Wait, did you just say ethics? Killing the journalist inside the consulate and cut him off with bone saw is ethical? World is watching how disgusting MBS is playing the game and hiding behind Trump with his bloody oil money.
3903 2018-10-22 16:49:55 What are you doing about it?  Passing budgets the increase the debt and give handouts to the rich and corporations. Confirming Trump’s federal judges. Continuing to take money from big pharma and big oil.  Do something!
3904 2018-10-22 16:49:46 You have my vote. You mopped the floor with Gillum last night.  No comparison. Never talked about his platform, just bashed you and talked about his morning olive oil facial.

3911 2018-10-22 16:49:07 Job numbers need FACTS. Increased population = increased workers. Duh. Absolutely nothing to do with you. HUGE increase in the deficit, no trickledown from tax cuts, trade wars YOU STARTED costing consumers. You are a snake oil salesman.

3919 2018-10-22 16:48:06 Doesn't this leave out how demand is heavily influenced by supply and marketing? Combined with strategies like planned obsolescence and subsidized oil production, there really is no ethical consumption.

3937 2018-10-22 16:46:45 Why don’t we keep our oil and gas here?
3938 2018-10-22 16:46:29 If you think Canada’s oil price is low because of transport, you are clueless about the oil industry. 

Canada doesn’t have oil refineries competing to buy oil, and Canadian oil is the most expensive oil in the world to refine. It costs over $150 per barrel to break even.

3941 2018-10-22 16:46:27 Some good points, some others less so. Eg, the problem of emissions is principally a local one as far as I'm concerned. And isn't coal less dense per kg than oil? So why compare weights of fuel?
3942 2018-10-22 16:46:26 Saudi Arabia sent more hijackers on 9/11 than any other country. “Strategic alliance” = oil & money. Save your lecture on disrespect. You disrespect Florida by talking a good game but ultimately doing nothing every time.

3949 2018-10-22 16:45:44 Gov Wolf has a good lead. Pennsylvania is the only state without a tax on gas and oil being extracted. Scott Wagner is pro big oil. The tax is desperately needed by our state. It would fix the budget.

3961 2018-10-22 16:44:40 It's also worth mentioning checking your electricity supplier.  (I know lots of people can't do this/meters) but it can really help.

If it's true US is no longer dependent on petrodollar arrangement w Saudi, then there is no reason to consider Iran an enemy

3991 2018-10-22 16:41:38 @realDonaldTrump Withdrawing Iran oil from the world market next month means that their production MUST come from some other source, else prices JUMP Upwards.  Between now and then, Saudi and the other OPEC/GCC members will be hard pressed to make up the difference.

3997 2018-10-22 16:41:17 Not really fair to say we are bought off for the cash. The Saudis are crucial allies. They are the main opposition to Iran in the region which makes them also of critcal importance to Israel. Then there is the oil. If we cut them loose they will turn to Russia. No good options
3998 2018-10-22 16:41:15 I'd be interested in buying @DoveUK products again if you could guarantee they are free from palm oil.
3999 2018-10-22 16:41:13 That’s not true @Calabresecuore.  Between 2005 and 2015, new oil pipelines that doubled capacity out of western Canada were approved and built. 1.9 million barrels per day of new pipelines to serve new and growing markets.  I know this because I worked on many of those projects

4026 2018-10-22 16:39:24 What remains out of discussion is the rise of non oil imports in India for the last two years . Oil price rise seems to have just ignored that.
And on top of everything the virtual stagnant core exports. Nothing that the government does today will ease this in medium term.

Along with all the voices
of the ones that weren’t “God’s children”.
So you walk with eyes shut tight

4042 2018-10-22 16:37:50 Trump won't use our oil because we're not willing to pay him billions of dollars in bribes like the Saudis.
4043 2018-10-22 16:37:34 That’s the courthouse in my hometown, Woodsfield OH. It’s probably all oil & gas traffic.
4044 2018-10-22 16:37:32 Just behind the times,  (aka UK transport Policies / Politics ) A common theme where road/car/big oil lobbies have been active for many decades.

4046 2018-10-22 16:37:28 Isn’t today’s immigration a new type of colonialism? We’re taking the smartest & brightest from the worst places for our benefit here. In 21st century human resource is more valuable than gold & oil.
4047 2018-10-22 16:37:25 Hope oil
4048 2018-10-22 16:37:11 Or is it because none of them allow you to drill their oil reserves?
4049 2018-10-22 16:37:08 Some days it just seems hopeless.  I've learned to rinse in the sink because lots of stuff sticks to that oil and grease...then my washer quits draining and I get in trouble LOL
4050 2018-10-22 16:37:02 You are affected by a faulty transformer-whose oil was siphoned- however, we are sourcing a solution to this. ^CG
4051 2018-10-22 16:37:02 1: Thanks for asking! All travelers must comply with federal law on transporting cannabis infused products, such as CBD oil, on board a flight.
4052 2018-10-22 16:36:59 You can get licensed in NM though. And technically on a federal scale its still legal, they just hem you up growing but the oil itself is pretty safe.
4053 2018-10-22 16:36:55 Value is relative my brother.  The fall in the value of oil has affected all oil producing countries including those with good plans for the future talk more of 16 years of theft.  To those who are getting their entitlements half puf puf is better than full chinchin
4054 2018-10-22 16:36:45 Many aren't (growth cap-ex).  As for $ of oil, that's the biggest weakness of commodity investing, and last 3 yrs has devastated confidence in oil $'ing. "The most hated rally of all time" is a fitting moniker for oil $. Other sector investors don't like it, so doubt/discount it.
4055 2018-10-22 16:36:42 So sad i aint jump on that CBD oil wave when it was nothing lol.
4056 2018-10-22 16:36:21 Agreed. Strange request since the statute is clear. Shocking if SCOTUS grants cert, but they for Oil States after Cuozzo when Gorsuch joined. Do you think this is a test for Kavanaugh?  #patent #patents #innovation #invention

4058 2018-10-22 16:36:20 Oh really? So where do you get your oil from? How about your power? Lumber? Wheat? Who is your # 1 trade partner? I will give you a hint. Not Isreal.
4059 2018-10-22 16:36:20 When you’re a country where you number 1  export far and away gets its price slashed by too much oil on the market the your economy is going to tank.
4060 2018-10-22 16:36:09 To all my gf’s out there, don’t forget to get your oil changed xoxo
4061 2018-10-22 16:36:08 In the words of Bill Parcells “put the anointing oil away” Sack Pisspot fans should take this advise. The Cowboys are on their way to an 8-8 season.
4062 2018-10-22 16:35:44 Who cares if you run on oil
4063 2018-10-22 16:35:39 “The reliance on fossil fuels is finite, we may soon see Middle East countries importing oil.... [the challenge of adapting] leads to a tide of nuclear seeking states” says Bud McFarlane, frmr national security advisor, in his opening remarks of the #nuclearsecurityforum

4065 2018-10-22 16:35:33 Fair to extrapolate? If China (largest oil importer) can demand/force  Saudi Arabia to settle contracts in the new gold-backed yuan why couldn't they likewise have the Saudi's import their arms from China in upcoming years as they increasingly militarize production?

4070 2018-10-22 16:35:04 Dear Sir, with reference to the government i would like to share my opinion for a solution in case you did not think of it earlier: Why not create a new ministry for oil and gas separate from electricity and water. Such solution may allow you to provide this new  ministry to LF
4071 2018-10-22 16:35:00 It's those Scandinavians again. First they create ABBA to distract attention away from the oil crisis, Idi Amin, and the shher brutality and horror of Scotland's disastrous 70's world cup campaign,

4077 2018-10-22 16:34:29 Excellent article to which I’ll add:
Killing the eastern pipeline ties us to Saudi oil & enriches the Crown Prince.  Doesn’t help our NATO allies stop oil from Russia.  It loses jobs building & operating the pipeline.  Any western oil sent east will come via less safe trains.
4078 2018-10-22 16:34:27 When I get a face lotion that’s moisturizing enough for my face I spend half the day blotting the oil . But if I get an oil free lotion , face is dry .

4080 2018-10-22 16:34:08 What reason do u use the cbd oil for ?
4081 2018-10-22 16:34:08 Used oil
4082 2018-10-22 16:33:58 I hope 112 fails for the sake my old friends and neighbors there.  We lived in Eaton, and 3/4 of the people on our street worked in oil and gas.  Even if it passes, and gets tossed, I can see companies cutting back investment in CO while the lawsuits are pending.
4083 2018-10-22 16:33:57 "Expanded access and availability of renewable energy sources like wind, solar, and hydro would essentially destroy and obliterate
→the highly pollutive and dangerous coal industry
→the highly pollutive and geopolitically toxic oil and gas industry"

Yes, please.
4084 2018-10-22 16:33:53 Canada allows the importation of foreign oil (in this case Saudi) and allows the exportation of oil.  The PMO has the power to halt shipments of Saudi oil into Canada and in retaliation for the Saudis halting grain shipments, it should be done!
4085 2018-10-22 16:33:46 @ruhlman used your bread ratio with a variance to make foccacia. subbed out 2 oz of water for 2 of oil. It was pretty yummy.
4086 2018-10-22 16:33:36 my favorite Pratima Skincare item is her Love Oil, smells AWESOME, I smell the vanilla bean first then cinnamon, then roses, cloves in it, reminds me of a Christmas fragrance, it's sweet,perfect to apply before sex or just to wear in general, I like for both

4088 2018-10-22 16:33:31 Vote Republican if you want to support oil and gas jobs. Good for Texas. Jobs!!! It will impact you directly or indirectly. Property values, low taxes...etc.
4089 2018-10-22 16:33:25 Doesn't it mostly depend on smoke point? Olive oil has it quite low and is not suitable for cooking.
4090 2018-10-22 16:33:21 Ahn! I think say you be bank/finance man. You want to port to Oil man
4091 2018-10-22 16:32:53 9th in power rank of influence!??? Where are you taking this from? The only that keeps KSA going in their oil reserves, nothing else. The Saudis leaders invest their assets in the West because they know a coup D’etat  they will the first one to flee their country
4092 2018-10-22 16:32:50 To be fair, I always have the thousand yard stare when getting my oil changed, regardless of the music.
4093 2018-10-22 16:32:44 and oil companies are never held fully responsible for the damage they cause.
4094 2018-10-22 16:32:34 It's shea butter and coconut oil season!! Time to protect our skin....something tells me it's going to be a harsh Winter this year.

4097 2018-10-22 16:32:27 Olive bar garlic comes peeled and roasted and in olive oil. You can chop it up and store it in the fridge. Best price at Fred Meyer.
4098 2018-10-22 16:32:19 Haven't pre-ordered, but am definitely buying this as soon as it comes out.   And I'm going to burn the midnight oil reading it, then read it again, and again, then buying more copies to gift to friends for the holiday season.   Will make a great stocking stuffer!
4099 2018-10-22 16:32:16 That doesn’t surprise me, we had Obama for 8 years. Don’t be shocked when our American POTUS lets Texas become our largest oil refinery. Got to get rid of all those regulations that have prevented it. Funny how the left regulates oil but not abortions.

4101 2018-10-22 16:32:02 Which oil price should be there? US price or discounted Canadian price. Sick of the national networks pretending we get US full price WTI.

4104 2018-10-22 16:31:14 No garnish. You mix it with the rest of the ingredients. Example:

Dissolve the yeast in lukewarm water & leave aside

In a large bowl, pour the flour, sugar, salt and stir well. Add the water with the yeast, the olive oil & knead with your hands until you have a gummy dough

4108 2018-10-22 16:30:46 Curiously restricted discussion at #EFC18 about climate investment (engage or divest with oil/gas companies). But now in a world where renewables are cheaper (even solar in Scotland!) - so issue is scaling the clean energy market in cities & regions, not talking to big oil
4109 2018-10-22 16:30:43 If you have a bottle of oil left, go and borrow a lot of containers, lock yourself in and start pouring...
4110 2018-10-22 16:30:42 @seanhannity you need water cannons and rubber bullets and dogs and tons of pepper spray. Make the highways unpassable in front of them. With nails, glass, oil stink bombs loud noise sirens. Whatever it takes. Make these folks VERY VERY uncomfortable.

4117 2018-10-22 16:30:00 Petrol Pump owners have no reason to go on strike for VAT reduction. They are paid commission on each litre they sell as per agreement with Oil Companies. Its none of their business how much taxes are levied.

4123 2018-10-22 16:29:33 @PervyPierre Pierre do your homework on the Energy East Pipeline in that the real reason it failed was because NO Canadian Oil company was willing to commit oil to the pipe as it is earmarked for USA where they will run out in 10 years as per EIA

4127 2018-10-22 16:29:12 Wall Street traders on biz TV wonder if Saudis are behind-the-scenes causing the price of oil to drop. Implication: gift to Trump and/or make Americans be OK with murder of journalist.
4128 2018-10-22 16:28:59 ANC and integrity..........oil and water they don't ' gel'.
4129 2018-10-22 16:28:53 I know i'm dumb about this, but why do we have to drill for oil in the ocean where spills are imminent and it destroys water, fish and us.
4130 2018-10-22 16:28:46 @ShireenMazari1 saying I dont like this version of that song is something else n calling it “horrendous”, and questioning why coke studio allowed. There is a way to express like and dislike. You poured oil in fire and did spread the hate more. More power to @MominaMustehsan
4131 2018-10-22 16:28:46 Free money is somewhat popular while middle-class tax increases are really really unpopular. Unsurprisingly the two UBI's that exist in the world, Alaska and Iran, are places where it's feasible due to existing oil wealth to fund them without middle class tax increases.
4132 2018-10-22 16:28:27 Today I fuelled up for $80 which is about the same as 4 barrels of Western Canada Select oil.

Meanwhile the US is currently building 7 new pipelines to world markets. We can't even build a federally owned one.

4133 2018-10-22 16:28:16 We can let them do their own business while we don't sell them our weapons, help them kill people in Yemen, and stop buying their oil.

4141 2018-10-22 16:26:52 Still missing a financial plan. Financially panels are not going to replace income from oil. If they cannot buy Alberta oil should they buy US oil? Saudi oil? There will have to be a comprehensive plan based in reality.

4146 2018-10-22 16:26:13 Hey magical thinking @SeaTimesOpinion & others waiting for perfect climate policy: how does defeating 1631 do anything to persuade the oil industry that it's time to change?
4147 2018-10-22 16:26:06 The name 'National Socialist Party' is an attempt to co-opt the term, not legitimately indicating socialism.

Further, this 'no -you're- violent' nonsense is just throwing oil on the water.  The folks who think blacks, gays, and natives shouldn't have rights are wrong.

4151 2018-10-22 16:25:51 Sounds like you need to know some history.  Which pipelines exactly did Harper shut down?  There were four major pipelines built during his tenure which currently carry 40% of Canada's oil.  Governments approve pipelines, they don't (shouldn't be involved) build them.

We've lowest unemployment in 40 years, wages r finally rising, lowest debt to GDP of G7, and FINALLY a govt committed to diversifying our economy away from oil and gas and THE USA.

4200 2018-10-22 16:20:58 This sounds like a terrific idea! I thought about the same thing the other day when I saw some CBD massage oil! I can't wait to try it out! Where did you find the lotion?

4230 2018-10-22 16:18:15 In my previous research olive oil is discouraged for seasoning. I use canola but I’ve seen flaxseed oil recommended as well.
4231 2018-10-22 16:18:12 Sometimes there is no way of knowing, but an oil change, checking wiper blades and tire pressure and condition is a good bet before winter.

4281 2018-10-22 16:13:44 Yes. U need one of BAP and PMLQ to leave as well. There is no challange in parliment. Challange is outside because oil and gas prices are going up in international market.
4282 2018-10-22 16:13:42 How about you Aid Honduras and Guatemala instead of looking down your nose at them and causing people to fear something that's not a threat. America needs to be more sympathetic! we want to aid people who have oil but we don't want to give aid to our neighbors

4319 2018-10-22 16:10:47 Go commit fire and oil
4320 2018-10-22 16:10:34 Bad luck, Jimmy... try celery, nettles, black cherry juice, fresh pineapple, fish oil and magnesium pills. Good luck.
4321 2018-10-22 16:10:31 I just don’t like the taste of olive oil so much.
4322 2018-10-22 16:10:27 This is so cool! I need to buy a diffuser soon  and find a substitute for lavender oil cause matt cant breathe and gets itchy around lavender flowers, lavender concentrate would literally kill him 
4323 2018-10-22 16:10:27 where do y'all get that cbd oil for stress
4324 2018-10-22 16:10:22 He needs a shower. His hair is greasier than a bottle of olive oil.
4325 2018-10-22 16:10:20 Soon you will see, then you will cry blood and wipe your tears with oil money, the people will rise up against your barbaric regime.
4326 2018-10-22 16:10:17 The smell of cooking oil is turning me sick ugh 
4327 2018-10-22 16:10:10 gue si belom pernah cuba, tapi karena gue kiat kantung mata lu tipis ga keliatan pake timun aja deh buat masker gt. kalo oil skin aku tida tau :(

4329 2018-10-22 16:10:02 $10 million in Oil and Gas money can have it's effect.  It's really shameful.  Tell all your friends.
4330 2018-10-22 16:09:56 We have oil. Shut up.
4331 2018-10-22 16:09:52 is that oil or red-coloured syrup? please make it the latter

4333 2018-10-22 16:09:39 Gotta buy some coconut oil
4334 2018-10-22 16:09:37 I love the internet! 20 years ago, I’d never have known that peanut butter and coconut oil can get chewing gum out of my 14 year olds hair!
4335 2018-10-22 16:09:36 When d  ran a 100% import dependent economy importing everything from all foods to tooth pick, what do you expect when d only source of revenue for payment- oil prices collapsed without savings?

4337 2018-10-22 16:09:30 There's definitely some truth in there, particularly when you see the kind of stories that are promoted by the oil industry, dishonest shorts (not all of them are) and their friends in the media.
4338 2018-10-22 16:09:16 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
4339 2018-10-22 16:09:16 Oil embargo cannot be worse than killing Khashoggi, an innocent man, in a heinous way.
4340 2018-10-22 16:09:06 Some say that calcium & magnesium (dolomite) can help pain relief Calcium requires fat to work, so I take it with a bit of coconut oil or peanut butter. That does work. What I do when I feel pain is to say, "I am NOT a body - I AM FREE - I am as God created me!" - (pure spirit)

4342 2018-10-22 16:08:56 Yes, but that was an unfortunate accident . Becoming self sufficient  will lead us to a better economy.   We need to demand strict drilling practices and make sure the oil companies  are doing everything possible to avoid another spill catastrophe.

4344 2018-10-22 16:08:44 Among other things Donald Trump is a ConMan, a demagogue & a snake oil salesman! He’s the biggest threat to our national security & our sovereignty!
4345 2018-10-22 16:08:41 I disagree. I think if there was a Canadian option for Irving, the Government would ensure it’s being bought. But when there isn’t that option, it’s tough to step in and tell them where to buy their oil.
4346 2018-10-22 16:08:39 Finally people started raising voice ... Advantage of low oil price in economy has been wasted ... Concentrate on Human resources and Job creation .. GDP will be taken care

4349 2018-10-22 16:08:27 I am and i know, n i would never do any such thing. We all know it already had so much criticism n hate already that when she said all that she poured oil in fire. Not cool she has audience she has a platform ahe could have spread positivity too their is a way to talk again
4350 2018-10-22 16:08:26 Coconut oil B?
4351 2018-10-22 16:08:21 That’s why people use CBD oil. It takes out the “head high”. I’ve used the oil for Parkinson patients it’s stopped their symptoms, children/adults with epilepsy it’s stopped their seizures, cbd reduces tumours in cancer patients and many more positive effects
4352 2018-10-22 16:08:17 Put loads of coconut oil n through ur hair after you’ve washed it n leave it for 3/4 hours in a towel then shampoo it out! I did it like 2/3 times a week n it total helped! Pain in the arse washing twice but it’s cheap n works!

4354 2018-10-22 16:08:09 Idk if it’s this way for you, but the pressure gets unbearable if I move too quickly. If you have peppermint oil or lavender oil too that can help with some of the pain!! When you get home, id stay in a completely dark, quiet room with either an ice pack or heating pad on ur face
4355 2018-10-22 16:07:58 Depends on the flavor. Like black pepper and olive oil? Recommended serving is 15 boxes.
4356 2018-10-22 16:07:53 Oh no, horrible - have you tried clove oil?
4357 2018-10-22 16:07:52 This is simply sociopolitical commentary on how an oil spill would look over the Arctic Circle. Truly some high art.
4358 2018-10-22 16:07:45 I work in the oil industry, and understand that when the oil industry is doing well, the price of gasoline increases.  Same for the housing market: if everyone is buying houses, the price of housing increases.  Simple supply and demand lady.  You’re not too bright are you?
4359 2018-10-22 16:07:36 Tough to get out of bed with the Saudis though when they’ve got all that money and oil eh? What’s your plan?

4364 2018-10-22 16:07:09 You know what's great about renewable energy? You never have to grit your teeth and tolerate a murderous regime just because you need their oil. Also, you can save human life on this planet with it.
4365 2018-10-22 16:06:55 Since our endorsement for Proposition 112 appeared several weeks ago, I've regretted that it did not mention how the oil and gas industry's effort to defeat the measure is breathtakingly cynical and conducted in such enormous bad faith 1/
4366 2018-10-22 16:06:44 Should rename “Privleged Right.” The oil based could be #toxicright.”
4367 2018-10-22 16:06:22 1980s--post Iranian Rev and hostage crisis, oil crisis, etc.  Fall of Berlin Wall encouraged a search for other scary "others" as well.
4368 2018-10-22 16:06:21 Under you @atiku and your oga @Chief_Obasanjo Oil price went up 4x Under your administration ASUU strike was celebrated annually! Under you NEPA and Nigel was in a sorry state,then now what are you coming to do... Get the thieves working??? @BuhariCentre @MSRingim @fkeyamo
4369 2018-10-22 16:06:08 Nah I fw Brussel sprouts. You gotta roast or grill them with some olive oil and the ol’ razzle dazzle of seasonings and it’s great
4370 2018-10-22 16:06:06 Consumption is not the problem. Given that WE are 90% of the biome, there must be constructive ways to consume. Growth is good in some places, bad in others. Runaway oil companies cause inequity and destruction. WE must exercise OUR right to put an oil company out of business.
4371 2018-10-22 16:06:04 Rise and grind let’s get this: 
1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast
2-1/4 cups warm water (110° to 115°)
3 tablespoons sugar
1 tablespoon salt
2 tablespoons canola oil
6-1/4 to 6-3/4 cups all-purpose flour
4372 2018-10-22 16:05:58 I checked the meaning of "Ally", in the Ronald Clump dictionary of big words and I quote " Any person or persons responsible for bruyal murder who can not be held responsible due to the fact they have a lot of oil and buy a lot of weapons"
Thats that sorted.

4375 2018-10-22 16:05:48 i know when i bring my car for an oil change, they thinking “damn this girl dont do nothing for her car but change her oil”  & they damn right, i aint about to be paying for all that extra stuff, if the brakes give out ima just hope the insurance cover it 
4376 2018-10-22 16:05:47 Because when the US refineries are on shutdown we can not send our oil off shore to export because we have no port access, kind of pathetic for a country that borders oceans on 3 sides
4377 2018-10-22 16:05:47 @realDonaldTrump Saudi Arabia doesn't need any credibility they have trillions of dollars worth of oil that the world wants you and everyone else will forget about the murder in a few days Money Talks
4378 2018-10-22 16:05:28 Nah I think higher heat is better. I've also heard that omega 3s and 6s are supposed to be a big deal, so maybe use grape seed or some other special oil?

4382 2018-10-22 16:05:03 Their story is Trump is compromised and what is anybody really going to do about it anyway? Not take out money and oil?
4383 2018-10-22 16:05:02 My wife had the same. I family friend tipped her off to fish oil. He used a pill with high epa/dha content, not just any suppliment. The total combined DHA/EPA should be above 1000 mg daily. Enjoy the relief

4389 2018-10-22 16:03:49 I used it last March. The process was def sketchy, but I don't know anyone who's had an actual problem. It worked just the same as Gastrogard imo but is tricky to handle. Best practice has been mixing the "pop rocks" w/ molasses or oil (can't touch water)

4391 2018-10-22 16:03:37 If you’ve made contact with poison ivy, oak, or sumac, you may develop an rash. This rash is caused by urushiol, an oil present in the plants leaves, stems, and roots.

4392 2018-10-22 16:03:34 Instability may lead to even higher oil prices impacting developing countries and populations even further.  High time to aggressively push on alternative energy strategies and infrastructures?
4393 2018-10-22 16:03:30 Omega 3 fatty acids are often referred to as the "good" fats. That is because omega 3 fatty acids promote both brain and heart health. You can find omega 3 fatty acids in many tasty foods such as salmon, olive oil, and seeds.

4395 2018-10-22 16:03:20 Magnesium oil if it's muscular pain. Medical massage. Accupuncture. Bringing the inflammation down in your body is a big deal. But don't discount pain meds. Change them instead. No oxy or fen. Ask about Nucynta, Tramadol, cymbalta. Non addictive.
4396 2018-10-22 16:03:15 Sorry, rallies, golfing and 'The Wall' are more important than a stupid polluting oil spill......
4397 2018-10-22 16:03:15 American capitalism wouldn't exist without the 'socialism' it embraces either. Venezuela's, by the way, economy fell apart because of capitalist measures, putting all their economic eggs in one basket; oil; and when the price caved in.. so did the economy..

4400 2018-10-22 16:03:09 when youre frying chickpeas in oil, add a mix of lemon juice, maple syrup and soy sauce, let it evaporate for a min then add smoked paprika, cumin, garlic powder and cayenne pepper, fry for another 30secs-1 min and enjoy, maybe with some tahini
4401 2018-10-22 16:03:04 What do you do to a country that is a Strategic Ally in the Middle East both Militarily & Politically, that has Trillions of dollars just sitting around (economic sanctions may fail), has stewardship of the Islamic holy sites, and has control of a lot of the World’s oil supply?
4402 2018-10-22 16:02:52 Opps socialist slip? In power they will take over Oil?
4403 2018-10-22 16:02:49 How about we invest in military help to combat the drug lords violence,infiltration of their police, local governments and military & negotiate for their civil war? If it was an oil producing country we'd be on it.

4407 2018-10-22 16:02:26 lmaoooo well if you like Asian food a really simple way to use it up is making Bean Sprout Salad. Just 1 part sesame oil to 2 parts soy sauce (just make enough to coat the bean sprouts) and a sprinkle of sugar then chill before eating. It goes pretty well with a lot of dishes.

4425 2018-10-22 16:00:19 Yes I did read the article. May I ask before we discuss any further if you intend to keep moving the goal posts? The issue is the oil industry buying Saudi oil. No export pipeline will change that.

4439 2018-10-22 15:58:17 We should all purchase non gasoline cars. I loathe the Saudi Kingdom. Let's put them out of their misery by going away from oil. Install Solar on your home too.

4441 2018-10-22 15:57:56 what you need to do is a break down of the transfer payments to government with this current oil price.  I'm sure then you will get Quebec support (biggest recipient).  Dollars and cents with the pipelines and without the pipelines, KIS

4448 2018-10-22 15:57:34 Cold weather is here! 
When was your last oil change? Cold weather can beat up your engine. Motor oil thickens when cold, making it harder for the engine to turn over. Call or stop by today! #cold #oil #carcare #romega
4449 2018-10-22 15:57:26 just guessing here but could it have something to do with lucrative arms sales
oh, and oil, there's always the oil to consider
shouldn't Saudi oil be running out sometime soon or does that just apply to Scotland's oil

4451 2018-10-22 15:57:15 Mostly these "other countries" are being decimated, abandone to violent gangs because of USA influence- via secret agencies, capitalist manipulation and providing arms to hand picked groups of thugs. USA has become a world bully on behalf of oil, agriculture, & arms corporations.
4452 2018-10-22 15:57:10 Always good to use olive oil in baking lemon cake is delicious made using olive oil 
4453 2018-10-22 15:56:49 I hope many more churches/pastors who do this get exposed bra, “insert holy oil “ wtf 
4454 2018-10-22 15:56:48 In need of a bomb ass hot oil massage
4455 2018-10-22 15:56:44 Came to the conclusion that my hair is too dry for cornrows. And oil and gel obviously aren’t compatible  I’m getting a perm ASAP I’m over it
4456 2018-10-22 15:56:27 وزير الطاقة السعودي : لا نضمن بلوغ سعر برميل النفط 100 دولار

#Saudi Energy Minister
We can not guarantee that the price of #oil will not reach 100 $

4457 2018-10-22 15:56:25 OPEC+ - glb inv 2 + ability (short-cycle) 2 control mkt $ of oil, via dynamic supply mgmt.  KSA/UAE/IRQ+RU in control of glb oil $, less national SPR optionality. Oil as military proxy, for FP power, + earn $, not spend $. IR is the Trojan Horse WH accepted as a gift of fealty...
4458 2018-10-22 15:56:21 Optimism about good jobs has grown by 25 percent
Added more than 400,000 manufacturing jobs since the election
Manufacturing employment is growing at its fastest pace in more than 2 decades
100,000 new jobs supporting the production&transport of oil & natural gas
4459 2018-10-22 15:56:20 No, there is a real crisis down there. If Central America had oil, Trump would be in there giving them "freedom."
4460 2018-10-22 15:56:01 South African companies must help out #Zimbaweans with precious #liquidgold. We can’t swim in cooking oil while our neighbours are struggling. Let’s be neighbourly.
4461 2018-10-22 15:55:52 Massage a few drops of coconut oil around the eyes to get rid off dark circles!
4462 2018-10-22 15:55:52 Yes, Russian geopolitics has been about the spot oil price.
4463 2018-10-22 15:55:51 I have to disagree, I can't call US interference a "help"!
It would be just the same as when USA invaded Iraq [their old ally against Iran]. That invasion resulted in 2 different things:
- horrible humanitarian situation for Iraqis,
- domination and oil for the US!
4464 2018-10-22 15:55:49 Oil slips below $80 after Saudi pledges rapid output rise
4465 2018-10-22 15:55:45 you’re welcome! it’s oil free too
4466 2018-10-22 15:55:31 Why don't we keep some of that oil/gas to bring down prices/give
relief to hard working Americans?
4467 2018-10-22 15:55:29 I've been excited to try the karkar oil + chebe powder mix on my hair, till I heard it stinks the whole place up. 


4468 2018-10-22 15:55:13 #FileMaker #oilandgas - Its nice to see the Oil & Gas Energy clients getting busier, this means we are busier with their needs and projects.
4469 2018-10-22 15:54:54 I just passed an auto repair shop and their billboard said ‘pumpkin spice oil changes’
4470 2018-10-22 15:54:49 The saudis control on power is eroding. As the world transitions away from oil the price will plummet and the Royal family will be forced to flee the country or be killed.  They have created a radical populace that is only checked by the welfare system. Stop the $ and it’s over
4471 2018-10-22 15:54:45 they absolutely do not. maybe an oil spill duck would be a better symbol for them.
4472 2018-10-22 15:54:44 So that's were all my oil went!

(No, but seriously how?)
4473 2018-10-22 15:54:23 I’ve never tried the gummies! In Canada I used to take an oil dropper that also had THC in it. Just moved back recently and my mom who is a pharmacist told me about these because she sells them at her pharmacy. Been using them for nearly 3 weeks and they work great!
4474 2018-10-22 15:54:08 Bro, ExxonMobil is not a Mobile company. It's always dealt with Oil & Gas exploration in US. 
Though, point valid for ONGC.
4475 2018-10-22 15:54:04 kemaren gue ga sengaja make the ordinary sama tea tree oil di waktu yang bersamaan dan skrg yg ada bruntusan gue makin banyak oye oye
4476 2018-10-22 15:54:04 BS. What lessened our dependence on Saudi oil was fracking. The renewables contribution was equivalent to “pissing” on a forest fire
4477 2018-10-22 15:53:58 Can I just say, I think human nature sunflower beauty oil (luxe) is effective. Parang may eyelashes na ako nang slight!!!

4479 2018-10-22 15:53:45 I put tomato on my face earlier and ate a messy sandwich with olive oil on it... self care  

(Lmao my face is so smooth rn )
4480 2018-10-22 15:53:43 That is the only Canadian company that buys Saudi oil. It's privately owned by one family & has the biggest refinery in the country. It runs as if exempt from most govt regulations, but demands & accepts govt tax breaks & financial incentives. It seems exempt from consequences.
4481 2018-10-22 15:53:39 This is a poor and dissapointing response. You havent even looked at my bill.

Its simply non-competitive and a jump from $85 to $110 with identical oil (0W-20) makes zero sense. Your employee and invoice do not detail the costs but a fixed ammount. Poor service by Jiffy Lube.
4482 2018-10-22 15:53:35 Most important reason - Tesla is an insurgent trying to upend a long established auto industry along with oil sector. Trillions of dollars are at stake. Next time you see gas stations, oil refineries legacy auto who have failed to prepare - they all (and many more) are at stake.

4485 2018-10-22 15:53:13 Im so happy I have a man that can literally fix anything in my house and car , cause I swear some of y’all bf don’t even know how to do an oil change 
4486 2018-10-22 15:53:13 Canada: The Useful idiot, Green Boy Scout. When corrupt Green NGOs or UN tell us to jump we ask “How high?” We are the only idiots in the world that hobble our oil industry on the alter of the vacuous Green Gods.

4488 2018-10-22 15:52:59 Females get a car and don't check the oil, tire pressure, or coolant. As long as a MF start up and radio work she ready to roll
4489 2018-10-22 15:52:57 What is happening in Canada? What is Trudeau doing? Who did we donate to today? No one on MSM is talking about Canada-how much roque oil was dumped at Canadian ports today? How much raw sewer entered the waterways? By how much was our debt reduced by Pot sales this weekend?
4490 2018-10-22 15:52:50 Geez, the best e-offer I’ve ever received is 10K, contingent on me providing all my bank details. Then again, I don’t roll with bankers and oil dealers! The future’s looking bright (and perhaps a tad slick) for you, @mmamas1973! 
4491 2018-10-22 15:52:48 It's a weird thing but coconut oil seems to lesson pain. I have no idea why. Put coconut nut oil on your finger tips I swear it works....let me know.
4492 2018-10-22 15:52:43 Closing prices: #Ftse100 -0.10% #DAX -0.26% #CAC -0.62% #Estoxx50 -0.57% #GBPUSD 1.2978 #EURGBP 0.8832 #GILTBUND 107.5 #Gold -0.43% #Oil 0.04%
4493 2018-10-22 15:52:31 The demand may have increased but Venezuelan oil is extremely heavy by international standards and requires additional refinement. It’s low quality priced it out of the market.
4494 2018-10-22 15:52:26 WPP’s HHO Power Plant Conversion Technology focuses on converting existing polluting power plants operating on Coal, Oil, Natural Gas, and Gasoline into green energy power plants that greatly reduce polluting gases and fumes.

4495 2018-10-22 15:52:26 It's about more than oil at this point. The Saudis allow American bases in an important geopolitical location and are major buyers of US arms.
4496 2018-10-22 15:52:24 “It’s like you hit oil, but instead of oil, it’s bees”
4497 2018-10-22 15:52:21 CBD Oil recommendations for anxiety and pain...l am not sure which type to buy. Thank you :)
4498 2018-10-22 15:52:15 ไหน ขอดูคอสตูมหน่อย
4499 2018-10-22 15:52:08 Collectively, Venezuela, Russia. Libya and Iran have more oil. Saudis have only caused conflict and perpetrated the most henious crime on US soil, 9/11. It’s high time world leaders call out saudi bluff. Just because Trump is in their heels doesn’t mean world should ignore crimes
4500 2018-10-22 15:52:01 Our global addiction to oil means for decades the Saudis have gotten away with torturing and murdering their own people while while the global community has turned a blind eye. The message is clear you can do what you like as long as the oil keeps flowing.
4501 2018-10-22 15:51:59 Literally my dad is best. This man went and got my oil changed....Car washed and cleaned out...and full tank of gas. And bought my  Volkswagen cap for my tire.
4502 2018-10-22 15:51:57 Don’t kill him bro so we can have that oil 
4503 2018-10-22 15:51:50 Air bag recall for the Shelby. I also decided to splurge on an oil change. $184 for the oil change may seem like a lot, but it’s still cheaper than my old Mercedes C300 if you can believe it! The price I have to pay for owning a high performance car.
4504 2018-10-22 15:51:46 I guess Germany doesn't buy Saudi oil, the ones buying Saudi oil pay lip service. And nothing else.
4505 2018-10-22 15:51:45 I use hemp oil, coconut oil, passion fruit oil and olive oil spread.
4506 2018-10-22 15:51:39 Obama's focus on renewables lessened dependence on Saudi oil. Trump is the very worst. I've never seen a more garish display than Trump's visit to SA - the orb, splashing his name on the buildings etc. They also pump $$ into Trump properties. Trump is openly corrupt.

4508 2018-10-22 15:51:21 I filled up my car and got my oil changed and was feeling real accomplished but now I need new brakes too and I don’t want to do this anymore.

Seger nggak belepotan iyaa...
4515 2018-10-22 15:50:47 NOTE:  
   convert just 20% of cars( to battery powered) used daily, and that will filter out the annoying "summer/seasonal spikes" in gas prices ( &  saudi power)

The conversion can be done within 4 yrs....helps prevent more recessions like 1973, 1979  (opec raised oil $ )

4568 2018-10-22 15:46:08 I believe in governing our own Country. What appears to be happening is that 99% of Parliament prioritises self and Party before the good of all of us and this Country. The snake oil salesman title belongs to Jeremy 'free everything' Corbyn and his communist comrades.
4569 2018-10-22 15:45:59 Every rich man in Kampala is so not because they work hard rather the speculate well in this economy. I'm told he had hatched this oil trucks business with JPAM and if I'm not mistaken Salim Saleh had the last smile

4571 2018-10-22 15:45:34 The setback would apply only to oil and gas facilities, so if someone wanted to build a house less than 2,500 feet from a well (for example) they would be allowed to do that as long as they met local regulations on development.

4573 2018-10-22 15:45:24 Mine too, but it’s just because it’s getting cold and it’s making our skin dry. Find a really good moisturizer and a night oil. Also, make sure you exfoliate. I use a natural honey and almond scrub from @RepechageUK. Honeys good for hydration!
4574 2018-10-22 15:45:18 And a lot of the oil is subsurface.

4583 2018-10-22 15:44:34 What was the fiscal deficit then and what is now. What was the accumulated losses of the Oil companies then and what is now. What was the 'reserves and surpluses' of the Oil companies then and what is now. What was the total borrowings of Oil companies then and what is now ?

4590 2018-10-22 15:43:59 If #SaudiArabia launches a 1973-like oil embargo against countries taking measures over #Khashoggi's murder case, it must realize the embargo will hit themselves the most as it can't afford such rigid action. It will also hit the stock markets worldwide. causing only more misery

4600 2018-10-22 15:42:44 I have both a Chevrolet Bolt and a Chevrolet Volt. Both are like driving sports cars. Plus the Bolt will never need an oil change, tune up or new muffler. By the way, might start thinking in kilometers (accent the first syllable) not miles.

4612 2018-10-22 15:41:43 That's great but why r u ignoring the obvious - stop approving projects that lock us into decades of increased emmisions. Worse royalties from them arent even enough to pay for oil sands and gas well cleanup. That not carbon tax is the real scam.
4613 2018-10-22 15:41:34 Getting my oil changed. Mention of astrophysics. Mechanic tells me “oh ya I almost did astrophysics!1! I like the conceptual stuff but without the math.” O ok so you like watching Big Bang Theory is what I’m hearing

4616 2018-10-22 15:41:23 If @LindseyGrahamSC had any judgement and values he never should have been a supporter of the Saudi Regime. Everything they stand for are antithetical to American Values. It is and always been about oil and $$$$. We are the customer shouldn’t we impose some conditions?
4617 2018-10-22 15:41:17 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
4618 2018-10-22 15:41:17 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Pittsburgh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

4620 2018-10-22 15:40:58 If @tedcruz wins it can only mean one thing. @BetoORourke scares people.I don't get it. Is it his honesty, passion, compassion, integrity, intelligence? He doesn't want our guns,open borders, 
our money, to shutdown oil. Ted tells lies you know it, but you're too scared? Of what?
4621 2018-10-22 15:40:58 "Nearly a decade after the oil platform went down, the government determined that the actual level of oil leaking into the Gulf was between one and 55 barrels per day. Now, the new estimate dwarfs that: up to 700 barrels per day. Each barrel contains 42 gallons."

4625 2018-10-22 15:40:47 Saudi Arabia is not an ally of ours. They murdered 3,000 Americans. What they want from us is protection from Iran. We don't need their oil; the only people who want anything from them are Kushner and @realDonaldTrump. THEY WANT MONEY. In this case, blood money.

JICA projects have the Japanese flag everywhere. Are you sure this pessimistic Sinophobia isn't organized and run from the West?

4654 2018-10-22 15:38:57 All it needs is a “fade out music, fade up kids and when they’re done, fade back up music”. Oil and water do not mix. 

Otherwise it is a superb piece of film, drone video and editing and the voice over is a heartfelt and passionate call to arms for all of us Jamaicans.

4669 2018-10-22 15:37:44 Yeah, Little Marco.. A journalist was slaughtered by a repressive regime that we are "allies" with for their oil, and your response is to feel sad about its effect on you and 45?

4673 2018-10-22 15:37:24 The hike in mailing & shipping fees will not cost Amazon. It will cost us. The prices will be made higher because of price hike in oil. Even if low income folks were making $15 an hour, they, & we, will not be able to afford the future.

4685 2018-10-22 15:35:57 @realDonaldTrump and #Americans must consider:
-#JamalKhashoggi is #MuslimBrotherhood, ties to #BinLaden, Al-Qaeda, #ISIS. #WashingtonPost provided cover.
-Prince #MBS imprisoned terroristic relatives, more women's rights, religious freedom, moved econ. away from oil.

4707 2018-10-22 15:33:59 Yup. Cannabis.
If you don’t like the psychoactive effect, get some CBD oil or capsules. They work for a whole host of things. 
My wife uses them for this exact reason... weather changes.
4708 2018-10-22 15:33:55 Still pumping oil BITCH 
4709 2018-10-22 15:33:55 the US exports more oil than Saudi at this point. You guys don't need their oil anymore.

4717 2018-10-22 15:33:21 Buddy that's just mainstream news getting to you. The real news is the genocide of thousands upon thousands of innocent people murdered in Yemen that no one talks about because everyone loves cheap oil.
4718 2018-10-22 15:33:16 Jiminy Cricket, I'm off my rocker!!  Sheesh, he's really going hard after the octogenarian "oil men"...
4719 2018-10-22 15:33:08 Toss it on a skillet with sesame oil and salt. The end. You’re welcome.
4720 2018-10-22 15:33:02 Let’s cut the bs-Khashoggi was killed by the Saudis. Our reaction to it however has to be measured & careful. Saudi buys arms worth over $100 B from us - think jobs. They sell us oil. They r needed to keep Iran in check & keep Middle East stable. Russians could set up mil bases
4721 2018-10-22 15:33:01 Why are you guys on the left so dead set against drilling for our own oil? If not fir oil dependency we could Gabe nothing to do with Saudi Arabia.

4723 2018-10-22 15:32:55 If it's still there, take shots of mixed lemon juice & olive oil (look up the home remedy). Tastes f'ing vile but it helped to pass one of mine... Also, smoke some weed, makes the pain bearable while you wait it out.

4726 2018-10-22 15:32:36 I block anyone that tries to peddle alerts or any form of snake oil . So please do not try it.
4727 2018-10-22 15:32:36 It is further worthy to note that the savings in the foreign reserves is purely attributed to the increase in oil prices as stated by Godwin Emiefele this year.

4729 2018-10-22 15:32:23 Mooch calls trump the “blue collar president?” Just because blue collar people voted for him, doesn’t mean he’s trying to help them. He’s nothing but a snake oil salesmen and they bought the snake oil!  #TheView
4730 2018-10-22 15:32:19 Holy God, how do you keep your daughter off the stripper pole with names like those?
4731 2018-10-22 15:32:11 ピポポポポ……（交信中）
4732 2018-10-22 15:32:09 Possible additives that may be harmful to any medical condition they may have. The natural plant is far safer than bottled oil which may contain preservatives.
4733 2018-10-22 15:32:05 Over time, yes! that’s why you should really try to take care of them after wards. like I would apply castor oil. I don’t wear individuals only strips but it’s sortaaa the same thing except strips don’t pull out all ur lash hairs lol
4734 2018-10-22 15:32:01 US Steel. if you wanna work in the oil fields.
4735 2018-10-22 15:32:00 stfu useless hypocrite! undermining the crisis in #Honduras, caused by regime change efforts YOU supported along @OEA_oficial and blessed by the US government, is the cause of this migration crisis.. They won’t get “humanitarian help” because they have no Oil
4736 2018-10-22 15:31:58 うわぁ( ;´･ω･`)RT
4737 2018-10-22 15:31:52 I only do it right before bed, so I can sleep for a 3 hour run uninterrupted.  Same issue w most edibles bc of GERD and gastroparesis.

The oil cartridges for vapor are best for breakthrough pain bc they are 90-92% thc which is higher than the plant content.  I need terpines tho.
4738 2018-10-22 15:31:48 Yet we buy oil/gas from Saudis after they attack us on 9/11 and murder innocent journalists.
4739 2018-10-22 15:31:46 *day stripper
4740 2018-10-22 15:31:36 THIS will get Putin’s attention. He likes to throttle his European opponents with oil and gas.
4741 2018-10-22 15:31:24 A beautiful and intelligent film. It is time people and companies make the distinction between unsustainable palm oil and deforestation-free Certified Sustainable Palm Oil.
4742 2018-10-22 15:31:23 Anyone who wants to know who the big guys are buy me 2lt of cooking oil.
4743 2018-10-22 15:31:23 I have done my own research on the effects of dairy/acne. I have often found that skim milk is targeted. It has less fat than regular milk, but not always less sugar! Raised blood sugar can cause increased action in oil glands & could lead to an increase in acne severity. #FN1010
4744 2018-10-22 15:31:21 Murderers always get released but get caught with cannibis oil in ks do 20 yrs....bs
4745 2018-10-22 15:31:09 Like, actual tears sprung to my eyes when I finally got enough oil together to make a lamp at night.
4746 2018-10-22 15:31:07 元号の変わり目のライダーのアニバーサリーって次があるかできるかわからん作品なので出し惜しみなしで予算を湯水のように投入してますね…
4747 2018-10-22 15:31:03 The Saudis are butchers and The 9/11 perps . So why does Doofus love them ? Oil , weapons sales and proxies vs Iran ; that's why . Donny cares not if they dismember a journalist , especially a WAPO writer who championed freedom of expression in his homeland .
4748 2018-10-22 15:31:02 Stop the deal with Saudi Arabia. Those trying to come to our country has not sent terrorists to attack America. 9/11 terrorists 15 were from Saudi Arabia. Cut off money going to that country. We do not need their oil or their money.
4749 2018-10-22 15:31:02 size...DOES matter, bet you thought we were talking about genitals but actually this is about savings on your next oil change
4750 2018-10-22 15:31:01 I need an oil changee

4752 2018-10-22 15:30:54 I still haven’t gotten my oil changed...
4753 2018-10-22 15:30:53 my apartment still reeks of sesame oil im dying
4754 2018-10-22 15:30:36 The sound effects are ... I mean, it's desolate. You hear animals sometimes. You hear wind whistling through the busted down oil tanker you're searching for resources, you hear metal creaking... and there is a day-night cycle. Animals are more vicious at night and it is DARK.
4755 2018-10-22 15:30:29 Very soon BBC will lose their dying reputation because of Biafra's oil and gas.

4760 2018-10-22 15:30:10 アユポッポ！
4761 2018-10-22 15:30:08 Let’s cut the bs-Khashoggi was killed by the Saudis. Our reaction to it however has to be measured & careful. Saudi buys arms worth over $100 B from us - think jobs. They sell us oil. They r needed to keep Iran in check & keep Middle East stable. Russians could set up mil bases
4762 2018-10-22 15:30:07 I love oil diffusers.
4763 2018-10-22 15:29:59 We need lots of agricultural incentives to go back to farm. There are cheap oil money around and corruption (easy money) ravaging the nation. Anything outside this will not encourage farming. We also need security of lives while in the farm.

4765 2018-10-22 15:29:57 But the forked said the oil@was running out during the referendum ?
4766 2018-10-22 15:29:39 UAE is an oil producer and water is a scarce resource there.
4767 2018-10-22 15:29:37 It is a Trump issue, last time I checked he was the leader. If it is such a Natl Sec issue, why not invade Honduras, set the peace, then people could return? They don't have oil or Uranium. 
Why not stop using illegal drugs so cartels won't take over those countries.
4768 2018-10-22 15:29:35 I went into a silent retreat last weekend expecting words to purge from me, but instead my muscles inflamed with fatigue and oil and vivid dreams. Everything else comes after this...ready for you, week.
4769 2018-10-22 15:29:26 Similar to CA’s cap and trade system there will be an independent board to recommend how the proceeds of our carbon tax are spent, which is one of the ways the oil companies and right-wingers are attacking the initiative
4770 2018-10-22 15:29:12 Always blows me away how weird Oil prices are. Whole Saudi thing & Iran sanctions should be driving prices up, it would seem. Economy growing 2.5-3.5%. What's up? I know, I should just shut-up & fill-up...
4771 2018-10-22 15:29:11 Trump was probably in on it.  An appeasement to Saudi oil money.
4772 2018-10-22 15:29:07 Of course it would be at an oil and gas event. @tedcruz is in their pocket. @BetoORourke is with the people this morning
4773 2018-10-22 15:29:01 Use tree oil all the time!
4774 2018-10-22 15:28:56 The smell of tea tree oil is nauseating to me. . . but ya boy needs to get rid of this piercing bump on my nose.

4776 2018-10-22 15:28:30 Fadzi ufambe bhoo tell them to depot Mr cooking oil please we want him to be in the cabinet asap
4777 2018-10-22 15:28:30 How can a company like Taylor Energy hide such a disaster for six years?? This oil spill will be worse the BP's Deepwater Horizon.
4778 2018-10-22 15:28:24 I need to go get an oil change but I’m currently stuck with trying to decide if i want to actually get out of my comfy bed right now
4779 2018-10-22 15:28:20 Peace in the middle-east will come when the world is no longer dependent upon their oil wealth. Green energy will render them powerless. Until that day the world is at the mercy of wealthy oil nations and the insanity will continue.
4780 2018-10-22 15:28:16 All of this killing in the middle East is about controlling the oil worldwide, we do not want any country to develop a safe country for their citizens. We yell from the roof tops that leaders kill their people, then we go in there and bombs them to hell destroying infrastructure
4781 2018-10-22 15:28:16 never forget 9/11. almost all saudis. funded by saudi oil money. NOT an ally.
4782 2018-10-22 15:28:13 Like oil tankers.
4783 2018-10-22 15:28:11 I’ve done 10 thousand oil changes so far this year and 10,000 times I’ve thought about drinking the oil
4784 2018-10-22 15:28:04 Bitin pa rin ang pinakahuling oil price rollback gayundin ang bahagyang pagmura ng bigas sa ilan nating kababayan. Kaya ang hiling na dagdag-sahod sa Metro Manila, tinaasan pa ng isang grupo. Kailan kaya maibibigay? #Saksi si @bernadettereyes.

4787 2018-10-22 15:27:41 Good move let's stop buying their oil
4788 2018-10-22 15:27:36 EURO. STERLING were falling on Monday, EUR/USD has returned lower back to 1.14700; CRUDE OIL was testing the SUPPORT levels again, 68.70 USD is holding.

4792 2018-10-22 15:27:24 They have been doing this to women in 1400yrs invasions. PEACE was LIE. Media lied to everyone. Supremacist Hate Cult infiltrated Democrats bought by oil $$$
4793 2018-10-22 15:27:15 it's 9:26 AM on Monday and I've already scheduled an oil change and a therapy session. I've reached my fill of adulting for the week.

4795 2018-10-22 15:26:55 Not oil its పెట్రోల్ saami
4796 2018-10-22 15:26:54 Hey Sal, Lucas Oil does have an entrance from the convention center. You don't have to go outside to get it. Great for cold weather games.
4797 2018-10-22 15:26:48 Imagine where we would be if our past govts invested the $400B oil revenues from 1999-2015 in infrastructural developmental projects and also spent a lot of that money on developing the human capital? Seriously how those monies were mismanaged ought to be thought in schools
4798 2018-10-22 15:26:14 Cash, grass, or ass baby... And oil.
4799 2018-10-22 15:25:58 Abba ..may his gentle soul rest in peace
4800 2018-10-22 15:25:57 You can purchase cbd oil in afew places where I live Andrea 
4801 2018-10-22 15:25:48 I used it in oil form but through the weeks I gained even more tolerance to it. CBD gives me bad migraines! I think my metabolism is really slow. I'm just going to have a smoke when it gets unbearable I think. I can't think of anything else x

4804 2018-10-22 15:25:03 Of course not! MbS has bought the lie from BCG, McKinsey and the other consultant bullshitters that selling off their public assets including oil production and reinvesting in a "knowledge" economy will enrich KSA by 2030 as they move away from oil. It's all lies of course.
4805 2018-10-22 15:25:00 U can invest housing & energy sector in Bangladesh,oil, LNG sector,electric  power stationsector,railway sector  & large oil refynary in Bangladesh u can build up.

4808 2018-10-22 15:24:31 I think I found the main cause of my comedone acne was using coconut oil to remove my eye makeup soo if y’all ladies could tell me what y’all use to remove eye makeup that would be GREAT 
4809 2018-10-22 15:24:22 .....are you for real 
4810 2018-10-22 15:24:16 Ended up crying at my Toyota dealership today
Told the technician that money was tight so I could only do the oil change today. He offered me the oil change for free cause I "go there often enough" and even cleaned my battety too
He has no idea how much he made my day
Thank you
4811 2018-10-22 15:24:15 I Voted for Michelle! Voted blue for the future of New Mexico. Southern & southeastern New Mexico suffer under Pearce, unless you are oil rich you are not his concern. Education and health care are not his priority.

4818 2018-10-22 15:23:43 Do those country’s have oil reserves ?
4819 2018-10-22 15:23:37 I find pure Lavender oil really helps relax our fur baby. Have you tried the @poochandmutt Lavender treats ? Or @lilyskitchen bedtime treats . Sending your beautiful angel gentle hugs x
4820 2018-10-22 15:23:28 Until FG realize that there is something better than Oil we will continue the merry go round of ineffective development!
4821 2018-10-22 15:23:23 Well, us rubes that work in the oil patch here in Canada know a con job when we see one. This tax is a cash grab - period. You wanna save the world, start in the shitholes of the world with their lax environmental regulations and laws.

4823 2018-10-22 15:22:35 I can understand a slow oil leak being a lower priority than a full blown spill, but letting it go unfixed  for 14 years is insane. People need to be held accountable.
4824 2018-10-22 15:22:34 Get some CBD oil for daytime and cannabis oil for sleeping at night.  It works like magic.  Many have used it to break dependency on pain meds.  And, your head will be clear as a bell.
4825 2018-10-22 15:22:30 Whenever the get pissed and go marching round London, pretending the snake oil salesman is some sort of hero.
4826 2018-10-22 15:22:15 You forgot the gas and oil platforms that make us rich and at the same time destroyed a big % of our manufacturing industry as our currency hardened!

4828 2018-10-22 15:21:58 Been saying it for years - if we have oil pipelines, why not something for moving water?

4830 2018-10-22 15:21:16 Not really. How? What is her plan? So on Tuesday next week we will stop drilling for oil? How will she get around PETA for wind power or water power? These are things that we are all wondering. Just saying wind and solar power is the future does not make it so.
4831 2018-10-22 15:21:10 Black seed oil ...has helped my husband and back pain. Hope you get better.

4844 2018-10-22 15:20:18 In History: A total of 444 witnesses took the stand in the antitrust trial against John Rockefeller and Standard Oil in 1911.
4845 2018-10-22 15:20:13 Lovely.
4846 2018-10-22 15:20:13 I know what will show them! Let's never build a new pipeline in Canada to sell our own oil equivalent to market rates. EVEN BETTER, let's keep our oil in the ground and keep importing Saudi oil. That will teach them a lesson.
4847 2018-10-22 15:20:03 I suggest Jamaican castor oil
4848 2018-10-22 15:19:58 Vopak and Oil Tanking were already developing the Brunsbuttel #LNG terminal in mid-2017 and RWE proposed one in Wilhelmshaven in 2006, so German LNG is an idea that’s had legs for a long time.
4849 2018-10-22 15:19:57 Crude oil Dec18 53 Puts trade 100 times
4850 2018-10-22 15:19:55 Isn't it true that after Kenya contracted you to review #oil Production Sharing Contracts, you advised the Kenya govt not to make the PSCs public and now we may never know how the ruling canal in govt dished out oil concessions?
4851 2018-10-22 15:19:51 Can't people see that we are run by big oil fascist Saudi Arabia as we look back at war&oil monger W. Bush that needed to be reelected by war and Saudi King used Bin Laden to do this war-making venture possible?
4852 2018-10-22 15:19:36 Delivering to you, the most unique fragrance oil that makes you stand out is why we're here.

4855 2018-10-22 15:19:28 Time to break the stranglehold Saudi thugs have on this country.  We don't need your stinking oil!
4856 2018-10-22 15:19:18 Is it a certain brand of castor oil I need or any kind would do?
4857 2018-10-22 15:19:14 Time to get some warm pjs. Got out the bed and my knees sound like they need oil.

4862 2018-10-22 15:18:32 You should try CBD oil its supposed to help with it
4863 2018-10-22 15:18:25 So i went in my bathroom this morning and noticed my wallflower scent thing was laying on the counter (don’t remember doing that) with the oil spilling out onto the counter. I picked it up and plugged it back in +
4864 2018-10-22 15:18:23 I mean she just poured more oil in the fire being in that position u know what i mean

2-1/4 cups warm water (110° to 115°)
3 tablespoons sugar
1 tablespoon salt

4868 2018-10-22 15:17:52 And the green states of WA, OR, and CA are all struggling to prevent new fracking and oil projects. 
Hard to brag about stopping coal when the same Governor is greenlighting FRACKING. 
CAUSE YOU KNOW, METHANE!
4869 2018-10-22 15:17:34 Ps.23.5 - You prepare a feast for me in the presence of my enemies. You welcome me as a guest, anointing my head with oil. My cup overflows with blessings.
NLT 

My prayers for you now

4872 2018-10-22 15:17:17 I see; but getting a corp to value all social aspects of the workers could lead to the company failing financially and left unable to provide for the workers. IMO the concept seems like oil and water; which leaves me wondering if there other things we can spend time mixing.
4873 2018-10-22 15:17:14 ماشاء الله من فين لك هذه المعلومات عسى ماكان معاهم ع العشى؟؟؟؟؟
4874 2018-10-22 15:17:02 Administration's have been dealing with the Saudis for decades even with all their human right's issues. It seems a match made in hell.  It's all about oil and arms.  It's been going on for years,  it doesn't make it right. Js.
4875 2018-10-22 15:16:54 Maybe there's a strong Correlation between having oil and having sloppy security forces
4876 2018-10-22 15:16:53 @grady after yesterday's game, we rode the Lime scooters from Lucas Oil to broad ripple. Yes I'm a grown man, no I wasn't sober.
4877 2018-10-22 15:16:50 You might find you can enjoy red meat in time. My non-red meat might be:

3 bone broth, very dark choc
6 lots of salmon/tuna, salad, raspberries & cream
4878 2018-10-22 15:16:34 When you and your single friends trade sexists acts such as “I’ll see your buttons on your clothes if you change my oil” “take out my trash and I’ll cook you dinner”

4884 2018-10-22 15:16:13 The thing is it doesn’t absorb it just keeps a layer on top of your skin so maybe you gotta make sure you wash your face right before you use it? Or maybe it’s not good for your skin... maybe coconut oil?
4885 2018-10-22 15:16:10 Please don’t imagine for a sec that Saudi as a nation have skill sets; please don’t take it as a judgement on all Saudi but ask any foreign expert serving in Saudi Arabia & you get the same answer! Oil wealth has “destroyed” them
4886 2018-10-22 15:16:09 This happens when you drink Honey and Olive oil excessively.. @ImranKhanPTI @fawadchaudhry @AmirMateen2 @KlasraRauf @arsched @nadeemmalik @MalickViews

4889 2018-10-22 15:15:50 MBS and his dogs power should come to an end, terrorizing people! airheads thinking they can rule the world with their oil and filthy money

4891 2018-10-22 15:15:41 Edibles or oil under the tongue.  CBD oil is also great.
4892 2018-10-22 15:15:38 Maybe we’ll stumble on oil in the process of looking for gold.
4893 2018-10-22 15:15:33 Lots of flip-flopping on the Street today....oil stocks dropping on Haliburton's mixed earnings news, but chip stocks are bouncing back thanks to a big rebound from AMD.  We've seen several reversals already by the Dow and S&P. Volatility though is down a bit.

4896 2018-10-22 15:15:12 That poll is unmitigated bullshit designed to fit the narrative of a close race. The sample set is absurdly small, the sample methods were wrong, and I seriously doubt the margin calculations. Even if the margins are real, they negate your narrative. Your report is snake oil.
4897 2018-10-22 15:14:54 That's not hard because all OBAMA did wad party the first 2 years. Remember BP Oil spill. He did nothing said it was BP's problem. Turns out that thinking went on for 8 years.  Trump had worked.

4900 2018-10-22 15:14:31 Chop it raw on salads, sprinkle with a little olive oil and roast in the oven, or cut into pieces, add a splash of water and heat in the microwave. Simple, healthy and delicious, the trifecta.

4903 2018-10-22 15:13:40 Waiting @ the Mazda service center for an oil change on Matilda. They got snacks, I’m excited. Also, they said my first oil change is free, so I’m even more excited.
4904 2018-10-22 15:13:29 Jack, resembling a 18th century oil painting, perhaps by the likes of English court artist Thomas Gainsborough. Kudos on the camera work.
4905 2018-10-22 15:13:25 Okay, so yes you keep it moisturized during the winter also but you don’t have to do it as much. Use leave-in conditioners and I usually use black Jamaican castor oil all year round to keep the hair moisturized and it helps with growth and grape seed oil too. I have lots of tips.
4906 2018-10-22 15:13:19 And, like always (not Trump specific) we won’t do anything because the Saudis are strategically important to US interests, from resources to geography to politically. Just another reason we need to get off oil.
4907 2018-10-22 15:13:03 No cooking oil? Love healthy meals? Don't worry, got you covered. Inbox for more on these amazing pans.
4908 2018-10-22 15:13:02 “Canada” does not buy oil
Oil is not bought by “Canada” 
NO oil is imported from Saudi by “Canada”
Trudeau does not buy Saudi oil
Saudi oil is not bought by Trudeau
PMO does not have an oil buying desk

Oil is bought by private or publicly traded oil companies such as Irving Oil
4909 2018-10-22 15:12:55 why is this oil meme going around
4910 2018-10-22 15:12:54 @Cornerstone_HQ Hey guys. Question from the other half: which of your products are palm oil free, and do you do a line of women's razors/planning to start one? Thanks!
4911 2018-10-22 15:12:50 My electric for a 5 bed 200 year old farmhouse with 2 of us is about £90pm. We're on oil so can't compare the gas.

Consumers are more aware about products they use. If they had quality products that produce my desired hairstyles I would definitely try

4923 2018-10-22 15:11:58 Yes, Gillum's closing statement in the debate was masterful... but am I the only one that thought... that poor kid was sent off to school with a greasy head and smelling of olive oil... he must of learned how to stand up to bullies early on...

4926 2018-10-22 15:11:48 also that Iraqi oil doubles as a DEWORMER
4927 2018-10-22 15:11:35 And that's it, you want full access to the market without paying any heed to the rules of the market. That's not going to happen. No voters bought the snake oil and now you're going to have to drink it.
4928 2018-10-22 15:11:33 This all comes after decades of interfering by the US in most of Latin America’s politics. & not forgetting all of the refugees that the rest of world is absorbing due to greed & the US’s insatiable appetite for armament sales, war & oil.

4937 2018-10-22 15:10:04 Prop 74 is oil and gas industry funded and promoted. Disguised as “local control” to kill 112 when it passes. It will harm Colorado immeasurably and do so with the full backing of #oilandgas. They don’t care about Colorado or their workers. Vote NO on 74.
4938 2018-10-22 15:09:56 Yeah that's what....seems he is gonna come up with something real big tomorrow. KSA might come out because of their oil dollar but MBS???? Let's see.
4939 2018-10-22 15:09:55 You only need good potatoes, eggs, onion or not (you decide, for me better with onion) and a very good olive oil, you don’t need anything else. You can use the rest (tomatoes and olives) for a good salad. Try to eat the chorizo only with a piece of good bread.

4945 2018-10-22 15:09:14 It’s part of the solution yes!  Moving from the burning of solid carbon (including peat and wood) fuels in homes also important. Reducing nitrogenous fertilizers also necessary for farmers to understand. Dirty oil cruise ships etc. are a problem too.

4953 2018-10-22 15:08:08 Let’s all face the truth. Democrats and Republicans all let Saudi get away with their crap because we need their oil and money the spend buying weapons.  The only time it becomes partisan is when one or the other is in office.
4954 2018-10-22 15:08:05 (A true Utopic UBI would be to fund it through any value produced by automation or natural resources, although I have these same conflicted feelings over nationalizing things like oil — which adds a bureaucratic layer, yes, but also does tend to benefit the entire nation)

4975 2018-10-22 15:05:06 the whole 'moral leadership' is just propaganda.

4979 2018-10-22 15:04:43 And you say you live in Alaska were you don't have to pay no property tax or state tax because of the oil companies and you get a $10,000 a year check from the oil company. That Obama was trying to shut down. With restrictions

4982 2018-10-22 15:04:30 That's what happens when you have a lot of control over a resource many need (oil), the holy cities of a religion with more than 1 billion followers (mecca and medina) and the money that the former two give you.
4983 2018-10-22 15:04:27 How dysfunctional are you Trump?  Canada has oil.  Canada is your next door neighbor.  Canadian oil is ethically sourced and is in abundance.  Canadian oil is economically well placed. You spit on Canada yet you cry for the Saudis.
4984 2018-10-22 15:04:26 If oil and gas will win every time a state referendum is pretty much irrelevant as the state politicians will simply work around it. I think regs are needed but not sure a one size fits all for the entire state is the right solution.
4985 2018-10-22 15:04:26 There's only 1 way through it, and that's through it. It'll get much better after about a week of being off the meds. CBD oil works, but don't take too much. Eat well and do some cardio exercises daily.

5000 2018-10-22 15:02:47 started using tea tree oil on my face so I guess what I’m saying is I have arrived
5001 2018-10-22 15:02:44 tea tree oil is really clearing up this nasty ass breakout on my forehead
5002 2018-10-22 15:02:42 Killing him don’t talk this wayU all say that U R against crime!Any how buying weapons is not the only way to secure the countries there are other methodsgetting good allies,building trustable bases controlling the oil markets,I believe that your factories will be off

5004 2018-10-22 15:02:30 Why is ours more expensive than Lesothos I understand Nigeria got oil but Lesotho only got water.
5005 2018-10-22 15:02:27 It’s funny how everyone always wants to blame the corporations. These are energy companies, not necessarily oil companies. They will produce and sell oil as long as it is profitable. If the demand disappears, they will turn to what is profitable!
5006 2018-10-22 15:02:12 Me Yesterday: The slightest touch of anything, even the fabric of my shirt, makes me tits hurt today.

US Government: HOW ABOUT WE ERASE TRANS PEOPLE AND WIPE OUT THEIR LIMITED RIGHTS?!

Me: Whoa! No thanks? I can just massage with tea tree oil or something. Seriously. It's fine.
5007 2018-10-22 15:01:58 China is stockpiling CBD. While the demand for CDB oil is going to skyrocket, the price will commodify. The potential for wealth generation for farmers is low.

5008 2018-10-22 15:01:51 I could have sworn it was Saudi oil.
5009 2018-10-22 15:01:45 That's the truth....Just Plain Nuts...#OIL and israel great expansion plan...

5011 2018-10-22 15:01:37 For everyone of those I have 4-5 that say just the opposite.  Anyone who has become a R under Trump is delusional, racist, greedy and ignorant.  Easily swayed, charmed by the snake oil salesman

5013 2018-10-22 15:01:33 @TimesNow @avniraja @Narendramodi_PM why is any one not taking up the issue of cooking oil used in our daily life as there is no control of the price as it is at Rs 95 to Rs 100 /ltr as most of the companies are controlled by Adani group of a car doesn’t run no issue if no food
5014 2018-10-22 15:01:13 How does anyone think "Big Data" is a good thing? It's just like Big Tobacco, Big Oil, etc… another thing to ruin the world.
5015 2018-10-22 15:01:08 Time for a 3arab intervention night. I will bring the fairouz, umm kulthum and abdelhalim hafiz tapes complete with halloumi cheese, bread, Palestinian olive oil and lesson plan of phrases to teach Ana #SAHTEIN
5016 2018-10-22 15:01:03 Saudi is a great ally -- if you don't count those hijackers on 9/11,  and hey,  looky at all that oil money that they're willin' to pour into  my failing real estate company!
5017 2018-10-22 15:01:02 Maybe but I'm still concerned about my olive oil supply.
5018 2018-10-22 15:01:02 and snake oil
5019 2018-10-22 15:00:59 PDP was borrowing to pay workers salaries despite the oil boom, this govt is borrowing for infrastructur which is visible for all to see and it's done in almost every country, what exactly do you people want?
5020 2018-10-22 15:00:50 Tell him to get some beard oil  (Also as funny as that sounds, I'm not actually joking )
5021 2018-10-22 15:00:47 How did this guy become a ' royal Highness' and for who? Leave my people out of this foolishness. Please take the oil and let us go mr. emirs.
5022 2018-10-22 15:00:43 A 14-year-long oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico verges on becoming one of the worst in U.S. history So get the company out there to clean it up and cap the oil spills - or take away all their property and money and have the Feds hire folks to do it. Make them homeless.

5027 2018-10-22 15:00:24 Flaw in your logic. Farmers already taking it in the shin because of US subsidies on wheat. The truism here is people don't give a crap about agriculture like they don't care about oil. They just want cheap.

5029 2018-10-22 15:00:22 Unsustainable production of palm oil can indeed result in the destruction of habitats - we need to work together - supply chain stakeholders, NGOs and consumers. Take part in conversations during #RT16 this November as RSPO will be releasing its strengthened standard.

5031 2018-10-22 15:00:16 I believe the vast majority of short money is from big oil, conventional auto and  labor, in order from highest to lowest. “Investing” hundreds of millions of dollars against Tesla is a drop in the bucket for them.
5032 2018-10-22 15:00:13 Did you know that red palm oil actually isn't that bad for you, when consumed in moderate portions? It's actually pretty nutritious.

5034 2018-10-22 14:59:53 My mom ask me if I want a Mercedes car because the car that we have now is been jerking a lot and oil is leaking and the window is crack. So I don't know what to do
5035 2018-10-22 14:59:31 You do understand Obama was shutting down all of our refineries because he thought we should pay the same as Europe so  are oil was going to be shipped overseas to be refined and sent back to United States that was  Obama kind of restriction
5036 2018-10-22 14:59:26 point taken size of nations , but barely an effort made here back to oil.1) We do not have to depend on S.A for oil, as a lot of it comes from our once allied neighbor Canada and Venezuela  Re. SA needs US more than we need them. [Israel and arms deal] ?
5037 2018-10-22 14:59:18 Lassi is code word ..just like honey and olive oil 
5038 2018-10-22 14:59:15 They are wedgeworks oil can Grant. They are available through Vokey wedgeworks. Great finish but they will rust.

5044 2018-10-22 14:58:28 I blend them (tinned ones) then add oil, flour, various herbs and spices and chopped onions. I then roll into balls and fatten slightly the shallow fry both sides - and there you have falafels  not exactly suitable for stuffing vegetables, but an idea for you 
5045 2018-10-22 14:58:24 So my sister bought castor oil for her hair (I didn't know so I asked) 

Me: Who's this for? 
Her: My hair. 
Me: Oh cool. Thought it's for the kids 
Her husband: You should actually drink it, pride is coming up. It should find you ready for action 

 YELLING!!
5046 2018-10-22 14:58:15 Haha, my honemade olive oil mayo is also on the web page :)
5047 2018-10-22 14:58:07 Just bought rosewood essential oil thinking it was rose hip and didn’t check for the price.. that mf was 16€  
5048 2018-10-22 14:57:58 だめー
5049 2018-10-22 14:57:58 And the sniffling deference of May , Trump and their predecessors. Just another reason for green field. No oil , no power, no Saudi leverage.
5050 2018-10-22 14:57:53 Money and oil.
5051 2018-10-22 14:57:53 
5052 2018-10-22 14:57:52 Put 4 tablespoons of baby oil in your bath water. Your skin will be silky smooth in no time.
5053 2018-10-22 14:57:52 So a fat girl posted a picture with the caption "snack".
Someone replied, "Oshey fat and oil"


5054 2018-10-22 14:57:48 Yes, it is poisoning us. So do a lot of products marketed towards Americans. But if they just wanted to poison us, they could use a variety of different biological agents.. Why spray chemicals and metals that cause the planet to heat slower? So we can burn more oil and coal.
5055 2018-10-22 14:57:46 Matlab tu khud ko oil or mujhay ami bana rai 
5056 2018-10-22 14:57:43 Vegan snack, 1/8 cup dried, organic yellow popping corn, 1 TBSP Nutritional Yeast, 2 TBSP vegetable oil.

Heat oil in a pan with lid with 2 or 3 kernals; when they pop, add remainder of corn, heat, shaking the pan ubtil all are popped, top with nutritional yeast. #vegan

5058 2018-10-22 14:57:32 It's counterintuitive but efficiency isn't a solution. If more efficient tech solved environmental problems, we'd be in heaven now. Oil is twice as efficient as coal which is twice as efficient as wood. Cars nowadays are way more efficient than cars from a century ago.
5059 2018-10-22 14:57:27 The petro-dollar is the only reason we give Saudi Arabia the time of day.

For those that don't know the petro-dollar = all OPEC oil on the world market is traded in U.S.D. That allows the treasury to pump all that free printed money into the global market thus avoiding inflation
5060 2018-10-22 14:57:16 Got chilli oil in my eye today and work and it was one of the worst moments in my life and I have a dead parent
5061 2018-10-22 14:57:12 You shouldn’t use lemon oil to clean a maple fretboard. It’s fine for rosewood, not maple
5062 2018-10-22 14:57:08 Get them to change the oil while they are at it. It looked a little dark.
5063 2018-10-22 14:57:02 You guys are aware that IS consistently attacked Kirkuk oil fields under KRG control and NOC/GoI control from 2014-2017, right? This included attack that brought entire production facility at Bai Hassan offline. Intermittent attacks on Khabbaz and Jambur too.
5064 2018-10-22 14:56:59 How terrible. I still don't understand why oil NEEDS to be transported across the oceans when it could be processed on land, at the very least, where it is derived. Sure, it costs more money in the short term but... I hope that pipeline headed out west doesn't ever get built
5065 2018-10-22 14:56:58 *Cough* can..can i get a sip of that oil tho *cough x 2*
5066 2018-10-22 14:56:51 WTI trading chatroom update #OOTT :  The room is snarky & well populated. Seems like the weekend was rough for some chatters. Some CFD long traders are acting insolent & giving some oil traders the fantods who are trying to be helpful. NQ scalpers take victory laps in WTI room.

5072 2018-10-22 14:56:12 You know Canada is so rich because it has huge natural resources - oil, timber, water. Just cos we get a Canada style deal wont mean we will be rich like them. Our manufacturing sector relies on borderless trade with the EU. That will go
5073 2018-10-22 14:56:12 Why is it not acceptable in this day and age to have anything to do with HE MP in your profile. They make clothing out of it !! Farmers in the #UK grow it!! Supermarkets sell the oil just like they sell Olive Oil.

We are not doing anything illegal. A bit confusing #lifestyle
5074 2018-10-22 14:56:11 This man's cologne smells like chicken strips cooked in old oil
5075 2018-10-22 14:56:01 So every time my car turns on my music plays via Bluetooth. Well currently getting an oil change and I looked down and my music was playing. I really hoped it scared the person moving my car It is Spooky Season after all
5076 2018-10-22 14:55:57 I totally agree with ur Guest. There should be uniformity of salary.
The salary systems in Nigeria is the reason why people lobby to be in one commission/parastatal & neglect the other. No wonder U see a medical doctor struggling 2 be admin staff in an oil company
@NigeriaInfoAbj
5077 2018-10-22 14:55:47 I’m getting my oil changed and the only thing that motivated me enough to get out of bed to do this is the fact that there’s a chick fil a down the road from my dealership

5088 2018-10-22 14:54:16 @CNBC how about writing an article comparing oil industry subsidies to electric vehicle subsidies rather than write a BS article saying how Musk has received so much help? CNBC IS BOUGHT. #realfakenews

5090 2018-10-22 14:54:08 Food outlets should have allergy information now, so you should be able to check with your local. I'm assuming the law is the same in Scotland.

You might need to ask if they cook with veg oil or ghee (clarified butter). Saying you have milk allergy often prompts honest answer!

5093 2018-10-22 14:53:38 According to Bucky F, the big pirates are dead, but WE still serve them. WE have to change the system in which brainless oil companies get their powerless CEO representatives placed in OUR democracy. After putting an oil company out of business, WE can restore justice.
5094 2018-10-22 14:53:29 Our economy grew with the help of the global commodity price boom. Of course, when a nation's growth is so closely tied to the volatile price of crude oil, it tends to experience downturns in times like this.

Brazil, Argentina Iran and Peru, for example, all saw +growth too...

5099 2018-10-22 14:53:20 Foreign gas being more destructive to the environment than shale gas.

Oh and a Corbyn government would probably apply sanctions to Saudia Arabia thus putting up oil prices, costing us more and being obligated to take the oil
5100 2018-10-22 14:53:09 The moratorium would prohibit all oil tankers carrying more than 12,500 metric tonnes of crude or persistent oil as cargo from stopping, loading or unloading at ports or marine installations located along BC’s north coast.

5121 2018-10-22 14:51:10 Cruz is asked about U.S. Senate race. He notes big fundraising by Beto O'Rourke, who the senator says is running way to the left. Cruz says people who want to keep economic boom going need to show up and vote, too. He pitches himself as the candidate for the oil/gas business.
5122 2018-10-22 14:51:09 Making out in California. China is allowing oil to go to war with China, that war was lost many years.

5124 2018-10-22 14:51:03 The answer to your question is no, but we r going to go through a tough ride, largely because the world has ignored our plight, through the influence of France & more recently America who's acquired a stake in the oil in the Bakassi Peninsula.
Unfortunately for them, we r awake.

5126 2018-10-22 14:51:00 For every 1,000 wells in state and federal waters, there’s an average of 20 uncontrolled releases of oil — or blowouts — every year. A fire erupts offshore every three days, on average, and hundreds of workers are injured annually.

How about this?

How much Russian /Trump /Saudi

5205 2018-10-22 14:42:39 For a while, at least; nations reliant on Saudi oil (2nd largest supplier to U.S.) and investments will sweep it under the rug.

5209 2018-10-22 14:42:07 And why have fuel costs become so high under Trump? Trump policy encourages rising oil prices & discourages renewable energy sources & higher mileage vehicles. This increases profits for the Koch brothers, the Russians, & the Saudi's.

5275 2018-10-22 14:36:55 @PFTCommenter put peppermint oil on cotton balls around the house mice don’t like the smell. I work at a storage facility so I’m at war with vermon on the daily. Also if the suckers persistent use sticky traps. Catch a lot with those and it’s less gruesome.
5276 2018-10-22 14:36:54 My sincere apologies if you felt offended, but thought we were talking about the policemen holding cooking oil bottles and buying cooking oil for their families.
5277 2018-10-22 14:36:35 Science is a funny thing for republicans. They love it when it builds nuclear reactors, interplanetary space vehicles, expenssives cars, battleships, new surgical techniques, robotic and chemical technology for oil and mining extraction, but never when it comes to climate change.

5282 2018-10-22 14:36:09 Oil and Gas, Energy Triangle into Europe and Africa and they need Iran for the pipelines into Asia.
5283 2018-10-22 14:36:05 @SenateCA senators must educate themselves that the so-called tanker ban targets only their home country economy. And that the consequence of stopping pipelines is the import of dictator oil into central Canada, again to the cost of Canada’s economy. They should help, not harm.
5284 2018-10-22 14:35:55 A 14-year-long oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico verges on becoming one of the worst in U.S. history. Jobs and economic advances are of little use if you're being poisoned to death. Greed will eventually kill the human race.

5288 2018-10-22 14:35:44 No, he owns an oil company. I think he did a blanket. But to be honest, I don’t like 112 because it gives away local control in a home rule state. I don’t know that I can say what’s best for Parachute, you know? Not a fracking fan though.
5289 2018-10-22 14:35:34 yep we need to have the ruff riders ride again; this time with air support? and this time we keep the land? #Trump2020 think of all those sourses we gain in farm land mines and oil & gas + all those new ports for our ships and just fishing fun? #Trump2020
5290 2018-10-22 14:35:23 A 14-year-long oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico verges on becoming one of the worst in U.S. history | when we had one them major oil spills before that was the push to be 100% vegan; nay to contaminated seafood
5291 2018-10-22 14:35:14 Global Warming is melting our Artic.
Oil Giants intend to exploit our Artic.
5292 2018-10-22 14:35:05 Getting a new car is all nice until you realize it takes higher priced oil 
5293 2018-10-22 14:34:55 Thank you
5294 2018-10-22 14:34:52 BOOM! Condemn them for what? They should have been condemned for 9/11 but Bush was too worried about going into Iraq to get their oil and Obama did nothing to make it better. Where was your condemnation then lady?? So, go forward with your head exploding! 
5295 2018-10-22 14:34:49 Something big is going on beneath the surface, 10 year yields, gold, oil down and stocks down.
5296 2018-10-22 14:34:35 Congratulations Alyssa! That lip oil is one of my favourite products!! Enjoy!
5297 2018-10-22 14:34:35 So California, the oasis of Green, is more reliant on OPEC oil than the rest of the country. Verrrrry interesting!!

I dor ku ma pone gel, e te bira crunchy and so Imma apply a lil bit of oil atrobe ore seka pa mi scrunch it)
5299 2018-10-22 14:33:47 I'm curious, why is only the carbon footprint important? What about the billions of gallons of oil spilt into the oceans, the strip mines, the chemicals manufactured during plastic production.. carbon is one small portion of a much larger issue.
5300 2018-10-22 14:33:46 Only estheticians & cosmetologist can wax eyebrows & when waxing eyebrows oil is not to be applied to the face (causes breakouts) & only esthetician’s can wax anything other than face. No double dipping at all that’s disgusting

5314 2018-10-22 14:32:34 It's frustrating.... everyday kuita queue for cooking oil.
5315 2018-10-22 14:32:29 I just learned there's a 14 year long oil spill we haven't dealt with and.. I don't know anymore.
5316 2018-10-22 14:32:20 On another note, I finally figured out how to apply the castor oil I bought and I think Im seeing changes in just 4 days lang.
5317 2018-10-22 14:32:14 How long do you think your oil change will last?
5318 2018-10-22 14:32:13 My read was that her position is against the egg / oil / vinegar condiment as a concept, not a pro-Miracle statement.

5320 2018-10-22 14:32:06 Oil- I'm currently rotating and sometimes mixing the oils I have. I like light weight oils like sweet almond oil, grapeseed oil and coconut oil (ma kuminsa baha man na coconut oil si tbh).

5330 2018-10-22 14:31:18 Haha hmmm idk... I only use castile soap and moisturize with hemp lotion or body cream that I made (includes shea butter, coconut oil, almond oil). I'm thinking about selling the body butter
5331 2018-10-22 14:31:10 You are the one who brought up subsidies. You refuse to address the fact that even with Tesla's subsidies, which go to the customer, not Tesla BTW, the playing field is not level. I have zero issue with whatever subsidies Tesla gets bc they are a drop in the bucket vs. oil/gas.
5332 2018-10-22 14:31:10 Absolutely, that's why we're installing an edible oil processing plant, amongst other productive uses, as requested by the communities we serve
5333 2018-10-22 14:31:09 When a ceo has a failing record you retire him and move on. We are last in almost everything and he wants to sell our land off to oil and gas. Paulette has plenty of experience managing and running a business. You should go to her website and read about her.

5335 2018-10-22 14:30:43 Does anyone know who the Ambassador at the Saudi Embassy in DC is? It is none other than MBS's lil bro KBS (Khalid Bin Salman). Doubtful he'll be expelled as he's also good friends with Jared/Ivanka and dripping in dollars and crude oil. Kushner needs to be investigated!

5345 2018-10-22 14:30:05 I hate to sound like Marie Antoinette, but is olive oil available in Zim? Can't the people (those who can afford it) use Olive oil instead of regular cooking oil?

5350 2018-10-22 14:29:33 All the more reason to focus on renewables if for no other reason than to eliminate a gigantic market for both of them who rely on oil money to survive.

5354 2018-10-22 14:29:18 Winter is here.

5369 2018-10-22 14:27:34 We have to turn our backs on oil. It’s used to extort tolerance for moral depravity, destruction of social progress and suppression of self-agency. And that’s just in the United States.
5370 2018-10-22 14:27:31 The universe is telling me I am going to get wifed by a beautiful chocolate king that’ll need me to shampoo his locs every morning so he can smell like coconut oil and mint til death do us part

5373 2018-10-22 14:26:40 Yes I'm aware, they hid underground until they revealed themselves in an oil rig off the coast of California in Fallout 2. It's almost like bringing down the oil rig unleashed the Enclave on the rest of the U.S., because they were quiet until then.
5374 2018-10-22 14:26:33 Allowing meathead pirates from the US oil industry to drive foreign policy and shape domestic economic policy is one of the greatest failings in the modern age. Why would anyone heed the words of sociopaths like Cheney and his cohorts? Only theocracies are dumber than monarchies.

5384 2018-10-22 14:25:37 For the time being, oil companies, unlike, say, tobacco companies, are a vital part of the world economy. The economy cannot function without them. We hope that will change, but it's not the way things are now. As such, a lot of people need to track the industry.
5385 2018-10-22 14:25:32 Riding the heals of Obama U inherited a great economy. Short term good, long term you have ruined the moral fiber, economic backbone the of mid class. U care only of yourself and have proved so by making deals for you and the .01 % of this country. Snake oil salesman for the rich

The threat of losing access to air base is more valuable than oil or military sales. Very complex problem he is dealing with.

5427 2018-10-22 14:21:52 Well, yes. Trading in (volitile) assets is certainly a way to make a quick buck via arbitrage or price fluctuations. This is nothing new, whether we're talking about tulip bulbs, precious metals, real estate, pork rinds, oil, or crypto. Makes for absolutely lousy money, though

My children insist on eating beef, so I buy it for them, usually discounted, as better eaten than binned. Life is too short for food fights.

5554 2018-10-22 14:08:52 LOL not 'prosecute everybody' ... only those who are GUILTY... of say, conspiracy with Putin, or conspiracy with Saudis, or gosh, conspiracy with private prisons to kidnap border-babies, or conspiracy with the coal and oil lobbies to rape the nature or... :-)
5555 2018-10-22 14:08:49 Your mathmatic skills are faulty.Misplaced the decimal. More like ten cents. It's a percentage and total price depends on how many dollars per gallon oil companies want for profit.
5556 2018-10-22 14:08:43 There's some previously used land in Waco that might be suitable.  There's some fire damage to repair though.

5560 2018-10-22 14:08:19 Jake you are wrong! Without the Saudis,  there would be no terrorism around the World. Saudi doesn't just export oil, they export terrorism!
5561 2018-10-22 14:08:13 เป็นคนที่อยู่กับใครก็ได้ เข้าได้ทุกคน แต่สิ่งสำคัญคือ ไม่ควรเอาเรื่องอีกคนไปเล่าอีกคนแบบเสียดาย อันนี้ไม่ได้เรียกอยู่ได้ เรียกว่า นก2หัวเด้อ
5562 2018-10-22 14:07:56 Easy one.  They charge too much and their products have no flavor.  Welcome Safflower Oil & olive oil to your life.

5564 2018-10-22 14:07:51 Import of crude oil and other articles are main hurdles in the economy of this country as I assess.
5565 2018-10-22 14:07:43 SPANKY is doing nothing about the spill, his buddies in Saudi Arabia told him that there is nothing wrong with oil in the water.  The moron believed it.
5566 2018-10-22 14:07:42 Oil & gas is Houston’s largest industry for sure, but a close second is lawn maintenance because there is not a goddamn day of the week you don’t hear fucking gas powered leaf blowers and edgers everywhere.

Thanks, @Jeep @mopar...maybe you should let people know when they expire...

5579 2018-10-22 14:05:48 It really saddens and concerns me when a CEO is irresponsibly ramping via twitter a stock they know is grossly misrepresented by its £cap reminds me of Lenigas, yet even HH will produce oil not to justify 10p it once was maybe 1p at a push but VRS cant justify 20p let alone £1+

5587 2018-10-22 14:05:07 I think I’ll believe the 97% of scientists who say we have 10-12 years max. They are basing their opinions on empirical data and years of research. Humanity has a choice. Adapt or die. 
You can keep using oil but you won’t live the 100 years.
5588 2018-10-22 14:05:05 I'm just trying to decide what dishes are best suited for racially-infused olive oil.

5590 2018-10-22 14:04:33 President Trump is disgusting. I can’t believe he is using this time to talk about how good Saudi Arabia has been in the past. The truth is Saudi have never been our friends. 16 of the 20 from the 911 attackers  from Saudi. Also  Saudi oil embargo. Never forget or forgave them

5611 2018-10-22 14:02:49 Dictators should be pressed to liberalize, & difficult for US to get right, esp when oil interests & reg rivalries. But need to recognize difference between dictatorship & Islamist totalitarianism. Iran under dictator far more liberal than after challengers unseated dictator.

5618 2018-10-22 14:02:25 it's the 0.5% LS fuel oil that's causing the safety concerns. MGO is very expensive for big ships, but OK hence want these new LSFO blends which are ISO compliant but you can have 2 on-spec blends that when co-mingled can go all sludgy (to use a technical term) and clog engines.
5619 2018-10-22 14:02:23 Good picture, if I remember correctly I looked quite like that during OIL. Some seriously good shit that was.

5629 2018-10-22 14:01:28 Elevating the fuel prices without any justification when the crude oil price is comparatively low. Price of fuel maintained high by imposing high tax rate is a classic example of burdening the general public(1/1)

5644 2018-10-22 14:00:26 That's why Trump's drive to reduce regulation on coal is so dangerous. Coal is dying for economic reasons, but it won't die if the government is committed to keeping it viable. Same with many oil products. If they weren't subsidized the market would shift.

5688 2018-10-22 13:56:33 The failure of Nigeria's macroeconomic policies to "ginger" a productive economy will continue to cause revenue from the crude oil trade to be spirited abroad to pay for imported goods.

5694 2018-10-22 13:56:01 The price of oil, Venezuela’s only significant export, has plummeted.  The government’s huge borrowing, partly a legacy of the years when oil  prices were far higher, has helped bring the crisis to a head.  Their energy only comes from hydropower,  which they had a drought.

5696 2018-10-22 13:55:59 Long Crude Oil Futures (December) at 68.52

Stop Loss 68.45

If we close above 68.62 (yesterday's low) then I will look to hold this trade as we would have an inside day failure.
5697 2018-10-22 13:55:59 One thing we can conclude is Saudis government is leveraging their oil power.
5698 2018-10-22 13:55:53 Yes, genius in the same way my uncle's theory about jews controlling the world's oil supply brilliantly ruined Thanksgiving

5704 2018-10-22 13:55:26 Isn't all of this about SA selling oil to China without the USdollar?
5705 2018-10-22 13:55:21 The irony of Trump chastising Germany for using Russian natural gas while now making it painfully clear that the Saudis can dictate US foreign policy because we rely on their oil is almost too ironic to be funny.
5706 2018-10-22 13:55:17 It was reported that the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has been spilling 700 barrels a day since 2004. Funny no mention by Trump. Wonder why?

5711 2018-10-22 13:54:35 Iran tortures and kills daily yet the US 1) turned back on Green Revolution, 2) lifted sanctions and 3) sent billions to fund more terror. And the media cheered. So the Saudis have oil and can’t be ignored. The media have no credibility and can be ignored.

5718 2018-10-22 13:53:42 Interesting article. However, would a Nominal GDP target not be a better guide for monetary policy, especially in India? Helps deal with supply side shocks such as oil price rise and monsoon shortfall far better.

5727 2018-10-22 13:53:05 Has Saudi Arabia stopped selling oil to the US after Obama extrajudicially droned four US citizens? Have arms sold to Saudi Arabia killed Khashoggi? Has Senator Paul contemplated a stop of arms sales after any of the 73 beheadings in Saudi Arabia this year?
5728 2018-10-22 13:52:57 Analysts liking the stock market "into year end" because of the possible "end to the trade war" miss the overweight chance of #Trump doing another one, ending a nuclear arms deal, spiking oil prices, pumping the deficit, etc
5729 2018-10-22 13:52:46 We are not out of recession. The recession was man made by the finance Minister’s bad policies. It’s not the first time Nigeria has had low prices of oil. In 1999 oil was 9dollar per barrel. How does a country that was an investment destination with a +15% growth rate projection

5763 2018-10-22 13:50:22 There is no reason because we are not faced with any threats. Once we are threatened I don’t see why not use the oil as a weapon.
5764 2018-10-22 13:50:18 Oil is not cute ugh
5765 2018-10-22 13:50:15 Actually it was North Sea oil and the financial services Big Bang, along with tax cuts, that turned things round in the mid-80s.

5794 2018-10-22 13:47:02 At the moment we are still in the refinery maintenance period so inventories generally go up in October. Plus there is a race for Iran to sell as much oil as it can before Nov. 4th. Then OPEC is pretty much maxed out. At some point the market will tighten again.

5797 2018-10-22 13:46:58 It's a great idea. I often feel irritated when I see celebrity chefs cooking for 'those on a budget', yet still assume that the folks they are appealing to have store cupboards full of oregano, balsamic vinegar and olive oil.
5798 2018-10-22 13:46:54 You just explained “how” the  are running their economy on our cheap  oil. They’re doing this as they build out a robust renewables clean energy strategy to one day not even need our oil.

5835 2018-10-22 13:44:11 Bought lemon oil at Yes! Organic Market on Columbia Rd. I seem to be going through a lot of it. 
5836 2018-10-22 13:44:10 So brilliant!  Why hasn’t anyone thought of that??? Because it’s asinine like you!  Less $, less stability...  hmm, wonder what people will do?  Maybe we should invest but they don’t have oil.  They could do anything then like MBS.
5837 2018-10-22 13:44:07 Does coconut oil pulling actually work? via /r/Dentistry

I have a few friends who swear by it but they’re really into the natural medicine/homeopathy community so I don’t trust them entirely. So I figured I’d ask the experts.
5838 2018-10-22 13:43:58 I’m glad u asked! I’m obv in favor of both of those things (no vaping indoors/no oil drilling) but the combo of those two things is very weird and doesn’t make sense to be put on the fl constitution like that..also cautious about the partisan Constituion Revision Comm, always
5839 2018-10-22 13:43:58 CBD oil is definitely worth a shot. Not a lot of info on it for migraines but it couldn’t hurt.

5883 2018-10-22 13:38:43 Kindly refer to my ORD099265907 of 23 Oct. Two pouches of Pansari Refined Soya oil have been supplied @ Rs 124 each whereas rate prevailing on your website was Rs 84. When i complained CC execs only greed to refund 20% amount as difference which was Rs 50 only as against Rs 80.

What exactly does the Left expect us to do about it? #Democrats delayed energy independence for the eight years under Obama, Saudi, said countering any action would raise the price of a barrel of oil to $200. That means $8.00 at the pump

5947 2018-10-22 13:31:41 Another tweeter reminded me to put in a bit of oil if it gets too thick/sticky. But definitely worth it.
5948 2018-10-22 13:31:41 A 14 year old "disputed" oil spill off the Louisiana coast goes on and on.  Oil spills on public lands rob our treasury while they destroy our natural heritage. We should not be rushing to open up leasing to drill more public land while we tolerate oil spills on existing leases.
5949 2018-10-22 13:31:25 We need to drill for more of our own oil and build a wall around the Middle East. Nothing but violence and oil comes from that part of the world.
5950 2018-10-22 13:31:24 We we signed indigenization policy in our oil sector and others we didn't ask other country's nationals how it will affect them. Did we?
5951 2018-10-22 13:31:17 You don't put an oil exec with 15 violations in charge of EPA. Or a guy who was exec for bankrupt Sears in charge of Treasury!
  You don't have 15 cabinet officials meet with Russians while under investigation...and Forget the meetings!
  It's not swamp, it's the toilet!
5952 2018-10-22 13:31:14 Yes! Just a smidge of oil is helpful.
5953 2018-10-22 13:31:12 And I'm walking to the trash with my four pack of Monster... then... "People perish from lack of knowledge."... aaaand, back to the fridge it goes. Lady, when you strike oil, stop drilling!
5954 2018-10-22 13:31:11 The truth stands on its own the #UKGOV need to let our companies get on with it and quick . I see the gas storage facility in NI #infa is also being pushed . I think they know we are vulnerable and liable for blackmail if we do not have fuel power independence.
5955 2018-10-22 13:31:08 Did you know that the USA is now about to build 3 new deep water ports to allow those supertankers to dock and take on oil directly instead of a sea transfer costing them a million bucks? And a good chunk of that oil is Canadian.
5956 2018-10-22 13:31:05 Don’t know what deal you speak of, specifically, but Dems have been with oil and gas before. Just look at Hick’s position in 2014. That said, several high profile Dems have come out in favor of 112, including @kcbecker.

5961 2018-10-22 13:30:41 Use a 1:1 CBD:THC tincture of some kind, instead of just cbd oil. Anytime you have equal parts cbd & thc it tends to be more effective medicinally in the body. Also is great for sleep, which is what your body needs when its trying to repair. Best of luck ‍
5962 2018-10-22 13:30:31 Please. The alliance is based on our need for oil and fear of a Shi'a superstate. Saudi provided the 9/11 hijackers and Bin Laden. We should severe ties.

5965 2018-10-22 13:30:15 We need to stop considering Saudi Arabia as an ally. If they didn't have oil, they wouldn't be our ally.

5968 2018-10-22 13:30:06 And "store of value"—while usually considered a desirable property for "money"—is neither a sufficient nor a necessary condition for "money" and never has been. Go ahead and trade or hoard commodities if you can and want to. That doesn't turn gold or oil into money.

5972 2018-10-22 13:29:16 Saudi Arabia is less a country and more an organized crime territory. The only reason it's a country at all is that a warlord (Ibn Saud, that's why it's "Saudi" Arabia) brutally conquered all the territory then used oil wealth to buy protection from the west.

5978 2018-10-22 13:28:25 I find it so fittingly ironic that it always smells of disgusting burnt oil and trash below Millenium Tower on Hawley Street. You can try to make something awful seem amazing, but it will always be awful

5980 2018-10-22 13:28:25 If the traveling Trrump snake oil show can pay actors to show up and hold pro-Trump signs at his Klan rallies, they can surely find voice actors to read his propaganda in front of a microphone.
5981 2018-10-22 13:28:20 The Saudis pushed for *both* American invasions of Iraq. The Bush Royal Family was more loyal to their peers in Arabia than to their subjects in America.

Business ties between Republicans and oil state dictators have a long and bloody history.
5982 2018-10-22 13:28:20 Still disappointed in the lack of reporting about the deal Dems have made with oil & gas to oppose Prop 112. #HD33 rep @matthewogray has taken money from Anadarko. Polis opposes Prop 112 for politrix. Neguse won't publicly endorse though he claims to support. What gives?
5983 2018-10-22 13:28:09 So this one is hitting on me in my husband's hotel, talmabout I should come and gist with him in his room Cos he's an oil worker. How can I tell him I can ban him from coming here without sounding proud?

5987 2018-10-22 13:27:34 WOW! Talk about moron. You discount anything that helps reduce and removes CO2 from the atmosphere because it's not shutting down the energy industry. Did you know that the USA ships almost 4 million barrels of oil and day to those same markets as Canada would've?

Maureen Dowd: "Donald the dove!"
5992 2018-10-22 13:26:41 Could Saudi Arabia weaponize oil again? Its no great secret to find that since trump came to power America is now a Major Oil Exporter. Producer wake up #UKGOV  or be blackmailed and bullied . #Trump #Putin #ukog #angus #weald #northsea  cut the red tape quickly .

5994 2018-10-22 13:26:36 The chief difference is that today's Saudi Arabia needs the money and can't afford to have an embargo. All of the ongoing reforms are a consequence of dwindling oil reserves. It's bluster.
5995 2018-10-22 13:26:33 Females get a car and don't check the oil, tire pressure, or coolant. As long as a MF start up and radio work she ready to roll
5996 2018-10-22 13:26:29 You don’t suspect the US intentionally destabilizes countries which A) large oil reserves and B) who’s leaders do not cooperate with the US?

6006 2018-10-22 13:25:56 Good to know. Seems like there's consideration to cushion inevitable impacts of an unprecedented change to economic & energy systems. Fairness is key. Years were squandered that could've been used to more gradually transition. Still, tough times for the oil patch.
6007 2018-10-22 13:25:52 FAKE NEWS...you have a conspirator mind while drying facts...if we only engage with governments that don’t kill people... reality is there are very few that don’t in the 3rd world! And they just happen to control the oil market!
6008 2018-10-22 13:25:52 Sooo true. In change management we talk about an important step being deciding what to take with you and what to leave behind.

6013 2018-10-22 13:25:44 1. To curb the refined petroleum prices Govt must stagnant Dollar conversion at I Dollar=Rs. 65 

2. Strategic sourcing of crude from 16 new sources which Govt knows already.

3. Curb extra cost or bullish cost on refining. 

4. Give platform for local production of crude oil.

6026 2018-10-22 13:23:54  The USA is building seven new pipelines to sell their oil to the world.
 In Canada, we’ve cancelled or delayed our own pipelines. Instead we sell the cheapest oil on earth to the USA, giving away $92 billion from 2008-2020

Saudi Arabia is not needed for anybody BUT weapons profiteers, corrupt politicians and the money fuels terrorism to create more instability for more sales. Like perpetual motion. The Pentagon wastes more oil than any nation

6052 2018-10-22 13:22:21 $cei OIL may be down a hair AT THE MOMENT but in reality , monthly bills SHOULD BE RATHER LOW , so how cheap CAN they sell it for and still profit, not counting NATURAL SIDE TOO
6053 2018-10-22 13:22:21 @CBCSunday @AndrewScheer That interview was a waste of time. They will have an environmental policy (pending oil biz input?)
6054 2018-10-22 13:22:16 If course that shit fell. Coconut oil was dripping all down the wall.
6055 2018-10-22 13:22:14 The urgency to become fuel independent is high lighted by the fact that we have to tolerate murder .The Saudis have responded by threatening a cut in global oil supplies which could push crude prices back up well above $100 1973 oil price x4 Oil States price of oil #ukog #angus

6062 2018-10-22 13:21:47 Sure I have a car. Are you any better? You throw a lot of stones at me so how much gas/oil do you burn everyday? I never said my money doesn’t make its way overseas. I buy stuff from China all the time even though I always look for a made in America tag.
6063 2018-10-22 13:21:46 I thought I was being innovative trying to warm up some coconut oil by balancing the little bowl above the mirror and underneath the light in the bathroom.

6067 2018-10-22 13:21:41 What real effect has this strategy had on cost push inflation?  Petrol price still increases when oil price goes up radically as it has,  Eskom still puts up rates by 25%, and drought caused food prices to spike etc. 
Using rates and slowing the economy has no effect on those.

6081 2018-10-22 13:19:47 There IS a distinction between “well regulated” and overly or abusively regulated.  A look at the Texas oil industry shows we have actually DRIVEN the important regulations.  We fight the punitive. Methane and Carbon emissions ALL down during the fracking revolution.

6095 2018-10-22 13:18:32 Rupee weakened against the US Dollar today as some foreign banks bought Dollars, likely for overseas investors who pulled out funds from Indian financial market. Broad strength in Dollar coupled with rise in crude oil prices weighed on the local currency unit.

6107 2018-10-22 13:17:21 The world has meddled in the Middle East since I was a boy (1958). During that time I have realized that they don't have the best interest of the Middle East at heart. KSA needs to reduce oil production by 50%. The price will Skyrocket and the Saudis can tell the world FU.

 UK North Sea revenue was £1.2 billion in 2017-18

 Cost of providing prescriptions has gone up by 25% in the last decade, with an ageing population and new drugs part of the reason

NHS figures show the total bill for 2017-18 was £1.3bn

I finished high school, joined military, got a job as a lube tech (changing oil) Ford sent me to school, paid for training. Now I make enough money to live happy.

6234 2018-10-22 13:04:36 “Oil is the devil excrement” at least according to Juan Pablo Perez Alfonzo, a VENEZUELANS who founded the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the cartel of oil-producing nations. “Ten years from now, twenty years from now, you will see: oil will Brin us ruin.”

6244 2018-10-22 13:03:15 CBD oil is good. I suggest you add olive leaf extract capsules that has 20% oleuropein in it. It will heal the inflamation from the inside out. Take one capsule with food, though, for easy digesting.  Do an online search about it and you will find lots of info, plus, where to buy

6499 2018-10-22 12:37:33 You are right but we did a great disservice to Arabs by carving up the Ottoman Empire + installing a wealth-hungry/human rights abusing/medievalist family who happened to be sitting on a big pile of oil instead of one true to the principles of the faith it purported to represent.

6505 2018-10-22 12:36:55 Interesting. Ingesting one or two teaspoons of coconut oil has a whole list of benefits not related to appetite. It's big in the fitness community that's why I thought you would know.
6506 2018-10-22 12:36:54 I hope you updating yourself cos the sale of crude oil has improved to 80+ per barrel
6507 2018-10-22 12:36:48 #Iran is a major player in the global oil market.
Last year, it pumped 4.5 million barrels of oil per day. That makes it the world’s fifth-biggest oil producer. So taking Iran out of the equation could seriously disrupt the global #oil supply.
6508 2018-10-22 12:36:27 okay, no more deep fried stuff or food with too much oil.

6531 2018-10-22 12:33:37 Because they are the only ones who can give us counter-terrorism intelligence about the terrorists that, yes, they created in an effort to keep Iran at bay. Oil is less of a factor now but Mecca must be kept out of Iran's hands.

You’re on the wrong side.

6551 2018-10-22 12:32:03 A 14-year-long oil leak off the La. coast verges on becoming one of the worst in US history. Between 300 and 700 barrels of oil per day have been spewing at the location since 2004, when an oil production platform owned by Taylor Energy Company sank during Hurricane Ivan.

6597 2018-10-22 12:28:09 the debate is already not rational with the EUs unfounded hostility to nuclear energy. this is about showing that people like us who understand the necessity of nuclear exist, not just people who are endlessly campaigning against it despite the need to eliminate coal and oil

6644 2018-10-22 12:22:31 Only as far as ENERGY FREEDOM ! Every heard that baloney from your Republican CULT ? We are supposed to have gotten away from these bad ME relations on OIL and GAS with MASSIVE USA drilling - REMEMBER ? Why does Kuwait citizen pay .91 cents a gallon and USA citizen pay 3 or 4 $ ?
6645 2018-10-22 12:22:31 Very smart because naturalistas were more than willing to spend akere.
Remember how we made the price of EV olive oil and coconut oil sky rocket?

I've moved to locs but I doubt I'd go back to straight hair.

6659 2018-10-22 12:20:41 Perhaps, but we are converted to gas from oil and have no plans to actually burn any more wood. I don't want to buy pellets, so this is more about making the fireplace an efficient heat source vs an empty hole.
6660 2018-10-22 12:20:37 Well that wouldn't have happened if we didn't have the Socred/BCLiberal rule for 17 yrs. We kinda got robbed. And now that we don't have a Calgary Oil appointee for Premier, hopefully we'll be able to afford that and get it fixed. #bcpoli
6661 2018-10-22 12:20:24 Source is less important that whether it's been damaged (eg by high temperature extraction/processing). Raw nuts better than roasted.  Raw sunflower seeds better than cooking oil. Also quantity. Omega 3:6 ratio way off due to too much omega 6.

6696 2018-10-22 12:17:06 Oil did not even cover free prescriptions

 UK North Sea revenue was £1.2 billion in 2017-18

 cost of providing prescriptions has gone up by 25% in the last decade, with an ageing population and new drugs part of the reason

NHS figures show the total bill for 2017-18 was £1.3bn

6736 2018-10-22 12:12:58 In my opinion, they should do wayyyy more than just stopping arms dealings... cutting them from the rest of the world for a while would perhaps wake 'em up a bit. And if they make threats about oil again, send the NATO, at least they'll be useful for once.

Why?

Does anyone remember how the housing market collapsed when the price of gas went to 5$ a gallon as Bush was leaving?

Nuff said. Saudi will do as they please for now.

6822 2018-10-22 12:01:24 ... hearings began.  The War of Distraction, of course, requires good Saudi relations & the Terror Kingdom pumping oil at max capacity.

6823 2018-10-22 12:01:20 I read a paper that correlated price and quality of substances with oil prices. Higher oil prices reduced quality of drugs as opposed to price.Wish I could find it again. It was during a guarana powder fuelled reading frenzy to meet a deadline.

I'm on the YouGov panel and fracking has come up in surveys but the question is always couched in terms of immediate damage to the local area, whereas my objection is principally that as much oil as possible should be staying in the ground.

7006 2018-10-22 11:36:06 If people were really serious about 'the climate changing', surely they'd be focused on massive clearing of rainforests in Asia and South America for palm oil and coffee plantations instead of livestock and coal power stations?

7049 2018-10-22 11:29:58 I had the same thing happen to me after my c section  you're doing the right thing, I'm sure the CBD oil is the best thing for you. Make sure you're getting lots of rest  I'm sure the effects of coming off of it are worse than the actual pain.
7050 2018-10-22 11:29:49 The fact that u are citing Breitbart as if it was a reputable source. If it was print media, Breitbart wouldn't be worth of soaking up oil.

7052 2018-10-22 11:29:26 Aye-yo Putin, 

score board:

US GDP — $19 trillion
Russia GDP — $1 trillion 

Weapons and security aren’t  Russia’s main issues. Weapons are a distraction from the real economic issues everyday Russians face in a world not solely reliant on oil.
7053 2018-10-22 11:29:07 Remember to do an oil change and maintenance every 20,000 miles.

7056 2018-10-22 11:29:04 Buhari was in position to scrap fuel subsidy. Especially when crude oil prices were low. And the sai baba spirit was strong. He could have done it then and had the backing of many. There would have very little opposition. Anyway....

7061 2018-10-22 11:28:40 government must intervene in that case. Growth in shales is singlehandedly keeping oil prices low and Americans prosperous

7068 2018-10-22 11:27:13 couple years ago they came up with this new way to get oil and natural gas from rock formations that is a much larger resource than Tight Sandstone. Shale rock is being used to extract hydrocarbons via something called FRACKING . You never heard of it ????
7069 2018-10-22 11:27:08 Arming KSA to the teeth will lead to a very bloody uprising when the oil is finished and the tyrant does not have anything left to keep the people silent. Instead of buying weapons, KSA should invest in education, science, and a new green economy, where the Saudis could work.

7073 2018-10-22 11:26:44 It’s bizarre for him to say things but what really astounds me is that adults believe him! He’s selling snake oil and they’re buying with no reservations. #bizarre
7074 2018-10-22 11:26:34 Question: If Saudi does price its oil for China in Yuan will try be able to convert some of those yuan into gold using the Shanghai Gold Exchange. It was talked about before but is it/will it happening?

Why?

Does anyone remember how the housing market collapsed when the price of gas went to 5$ a gallon as Bush was leaving?

Nuff said. Saudi will do as they please for now.

7100 2018-10-22 11:23:08 @realDonaldTrump You want low oil prices. Aren't reason to ask Saudi King for this, he will ask something on change, on response they have increased price. I have gived you solution not how to decrease oil price but how to fix it. Act.

7118 2018-10-22 11:20:01 Once again America shows the world how to go into oil production.

First, build up capacity across the economy.

Then over a two-year period overtake both Saudi Arabia and Russia as the world's leading producer of crude oil.

7183 2018-10-22 11:11:35 This whole Khashoggi debacle proves (again) that the Saudi royals aren't exactly the most intelligent individuals. If it weren't for the oil they'd still be riding camels through the desolation
7184 2018-10-22 11:11:30 Heinz mayo is drab. It tastes like a mouthful of salad oil. Belgian is much more sour and hearty.

There are so many tastes in mayo that saying 'mayo is bad' is like saying 'chocolate is bad'. There's just too much variation to make sense of that.
7185 2018-10-22 11:11:03 I got a lot to do today I need to get my car detailed and I need to possibly get an oil change

7199 2018-10-22 11:10:10 I heard (well after school) that the U.S. finessed Japan into an act of aggression (Pearl Harbour) by siding with China, having military in China & cutting off Japanese oil supplies.
7200 2018-10-22 11:10:04 Do the research. There's evidence about ill-health in areas around fracking, methane leakage, contamination of water table, silica & hazardous chemical exposure, huge use of water. But also to keep to the 1.5 degree rise in temperature, we can't burn this oil?
7201 2018-10-22 11:10:02 So today we had a Literature lesson to finish of the syllabus and our teacher was so nice and brought coffee and brownies for us But Zimbos being Zimbos someone said “dai vaunza cooking oil”

7230 2018-10-22 11:05:44 .. In my experience, girls don't admit having a crush on a guy till they've secured him in their arms. 
Then you'd start hearing how she was crushing, crashing & stalking u..  till then, they'd jus be frontin & pourin oil drums of signs everywhere so that you'd slip&fall.

7253 2018-10-22 11:02:18 Not against Fracking in many ways but why would this delight Putin/Saudis? Is it just because of perceived reliance on their crude oil for energy? (genuine question BTW) also why not expand nuclear Industry? (I know the greens would be pissed still but far more effective)
7254 2018-10-22 11:02:16 Are you using CBD oil 3x per day? Take milk thistle to detox your liver and curcumin to help with inflammation. Have your hormones checked. Low testosterone and low progesterone can cause joint and muscle pain.L-theanine helps with anxiety

7256 2018-10-22 11:02:03 Any reason why shale gas in particular? I can see the argument for (properly) managed nuclear energy, that has a much greater lifespan and (potentially, carbon costs of building and decommissioning) lower environmental cost than shale gas. We can’t have oil/gas/coal in the energy

7291 2018-10-22 10:57:33 Also, some CBD oil's may contain only CBD isolated and then just a carrier oil (when you want a whole plant CBD rich extract) so when your comparing companies, ask for lab reports to check the CBD levels. If they don't give you a lab report, consider that a red flag
7292 2018-10-22 10:57:19 So, instead we’ll import oil produced by volatile and dodgy regimes in the Middle East and Russia while at the same time remitting billions of pounds to their coffers.

7350 2018-10-22 10:47:33 @realDonaldTrump We must remember 1973 embargo imposed by Saudi Arabia. If America create a non connected to OPEC oil cartel then we can divide between members and replace oil volume export banned from Saudi Arabia. Forget Khashoggi, America anyway must be leader on oil market.

7358 2018-10-22 10:47:01 I don't know the amount, but there is only so much coal to mine before it's gone. 

Just like oil. 

When you remove something (mine it), then it is no longer there. 

It doesn't grow back. 

It's gone. 

How is that concept hard to follow?
7359 2018-10-22 10:46:59 Not until another independence referendum is called, then it definitely will be. Remember they told us we were making up the huge west of Shetland oil fields in 2014?
7360 2018-10-22 10:46:54 A resource is only worth the profit you can sell it for and oil fields that don't exist actually don't exist. You suffer from lack of knowledge especially claiming you're paying for anything south of the border.

7437 2018-10-22 10:33:42 I also said more nutrients. Our current mode of agriculture doesn't allow soil to self-fertilize, meaning increased production of fertilizer is needed, which requires natural gas and oil. The increased need will force prices higher, making food more expensive.

7458 2018-10-22 10:30:18 It’s a good idea. But I wouldn’t eat it. I’d feed it to the yard animals though.
7459 2018-10-22 10:30:15 I would look into #C60 Olive Oil (can be made in other oils as well, Avacado, Coconut, etc.). C60 is a powerful antioxidant that can keep your body in homeostasis allowing it to heal itself.
7460 2018-10-22 10:30:10 If subsidies are your biggest problem, you can’t blame Tesla. 1) I’m sure it’s not exclusively for them 2) it’s regulators who decide on subsidies. There are a lot of incentives for solar already. Shouldnt effective solutions getting us away form oil/CO2 be supported even more?
7461 2018-10-22 10:29:46 The best part is he honestly looks surprised she did cheat on him.
7462 2018-10-22 10:29:28 5 million would easily create $300,000 in annual income. An average couple will also get $40,000 in SS.  So Suze thinks you need $340,000 a year to retire. That income puts you in the 1%.  I always thought she was a snake oil salesmen.
7463 2018-10-22 10:29:03 Can I just buy a mayo and then put the garlic cloves and the olive oil?
7464 2018-10-22 10:28:42 @CNN the murder of Jamal Khashoggi is as well a murder of freedom of speech. The world must not sit and watch such cruelty because of 'oil momey'.

Can you deal lol
7470 2018-10-22 10:28:06 @realDonaldTrump Hilarious! US stockpiled all of this oil for all of this time, and in the end it's going to have to stay in the ground so it doesn't cause a global climate catastrophe. It's essentially worthless soon, just like coal. Soo we won't be able to save oil jobs either.

7479 2018-10-22 10:27:02 I can’t wait to get my hands on some CBD oil. I would rather use that for my pain and mental health over pills.

7484 2018-10-22 10:26:10 With all due respect, the 9/11 terrorists by and large were Saudi and our relationship is at best a necessary evil.  If they didn’t have oil we’d have carpet bombed them after the attack. Just saying.

7486 2018-10-22 10:25:32 The primary goal of the West since WWII has been to keep the Saudi dynasty in charge of Arabia, no matter how heinous they get. If they fall, the only likely outcome in that country is "Isis with oil," as someone else put it.

7583 2018-10-22 10:09:09 Well, the US as of this situation can't issue sanctions on Saudi. It can't afford to lose such a large weapons client, especially considering Saudi is waging war with Yemen. If US decides to issue sanctions, Saudi may retaliate by not selling oil to it too.
7584 2018-10-22 10:09:04 Oil rises above $80, Saudi Arabia plans output increase: Oil edged above $80 a barrel on Monday, lifted by nervousness over a worsening diplomatic crisis between Saudi Arabia and the West, just two weeks before U.S. sanctions potentially choke off Iranian crude supplies.

Defeat devices in 11 million vehicles to cheat emissions (by 40-70x) at VW was highly unethical and immoral btw.

7603 2018-10-22 10:05:49 Garbage. The gas price in the U.S. Is 3.50 a gallon . Oil is less than 80$ a barrel. If you sanction the saudis and oil is 400$ a barrel , which they are saying, at 17.50 a gallon it will cripple the economy

We cannot sit on value & potential & do nothing with it but administer wages & simple tasks & see this as someone else's issue

• A gallon of 'TOTAL 5000W' engine oil was N750 then, it is N4800 now
• Naira was 150 to $1.
• A bag of cement was N900.

7870 2018-10-22 09:20:40 People pray for cake. Then when God gives them butter, eggs, oil, icing, a pan and an oven, they get frustrated and leave the kitchen. Blessings are usually messy and in a work suit.

7945 2018-10-22 09:05:56 An idea for @BBCNews and other media. Instead of headlines saying how many million barrels of oil @BP_plc will pump out of this new oilfield, report how many million tonnes of CO2 will end up changing our climate as a result.

8125 2018-10-22 08:33:31 The law of nature and karma is such that every greedy pig gets butchered mercilessly. If a person has no common sense to distinguish between a snake oil seller and a successful trader then he deserves to get butchered. I dont have any regards for Mr Sundar too. (3/n)

8130 2018-10-22 08:32:29 He’s saying his problem with corruption is that investments in the oil and gas industry may not continue if corruption does. That’s what he meant by “secure the environment “. Where he messed up was the part about his wife.
8131 2018-10-22 08:32:28 Hey~ why dont you carry on w/ your 2 followers? There's one thing for certain: I WILL NOT be quiet, as long as that snake oil salesman occupies the WH & our liberty continues to be in jeopardy.

8132 2018-10-22 08:32:21 There are no stars in sight,
No guiding light,
Nothing in the forest bush,
Only trashed trees and dust
Of the lost regions, to the digger,
And hard hats
To the fatter pockets
Of the Palm Oil producers
And we, and the wild animals
Are the losers
So sad

8266 2018-10-22 08:08:33 I like that point. I like the point where its unbelievable how the horrors in Yemen are never addressed because oil has too much clout. But I don't like the point that the journalist murder is a trivial one, nor that the cover up was so natural for all the parties involved.

8311 2018-10-22 08:01:00 Both central and states should reduce tax or bring it in to GST (max 28 %)
An eg. in Rs. crude oil /liter approx. 39 + 4 (Prod.+company margin + Freight cost.) = 43. 
In addition to this excise duty (central) 19.5 + bunk Commission 3.75 + VAT (32 %) = Rs. 85

Coincidentally, Kachukwu said Prices of oil are forecast to fall after 2030, and stay low for a long period after that. We're Out of Time.

8321 2018-10-22 08:00:07 Valid point there. Wasn’t thinking about restaurant dosas. Yep, all that oil and honey won’t mix.
8322 2018-10-22 08:00:05 No.

There'd be a loss of British/US jobs, and diminishing channels for diplomacy.

Making Saudi look like the misogynistic, oppressive regime it is will hurt it's economy/standing. They recognise they need more than oil in the liong run.

If you find a CBD oil from hemp that has 0% THC, majority of the time they will be using an isolate CBD molecule in a carrier oil meaning not full spectrum and therefore less effective

8340 2018-10-22 07:57:50 Hmm perhaps home made dosas with something sweet would taste more palatable than, say, restaurant ones because the restaurant ones use an abundance of oil which enhances the saltiness, which would really grate with maple syrup/honey/jaggery (in my opinion) 
8341 2018-10-22 07:57:35 Someone should clear me pls:

Tema Oil Refinery (TOR) will resume refining crude next week. They buy &import crude from British Petroleum (BP) while Tullow Oil (another British company) is drilling & exporting Ghana’s crude in the western region. What’s wrong with this picture?

Oil may leak and kill wildlife, but if gas leaks it could destroy homes and kill families while leeching toxins.

"You put money in the consumers pocket,  oil companies see it,  they raise gas prices so they can take it. Bingo, your lesson in capitalism."
8388 2018-10-22 07:48:53 The thing that's just horrifying is the number of times they've done this - kidnappings, murders, illegal extraditions etc and gotten away with it. They pissed because we're actually reacting now. All because we're not as dependent on their oil.

8436 2018-10-22 07:40:57 Sorry you're disappointed. We use Rapeseed Oil due to it's lower levels of saturated fats, compared to alternatives. I'll pass on your feedback to our Food Team for consideration. Thanks for getting in touch - Melissa

Companies may have to drill deep to free up water. That would dilute pumped salt content. Unless they pump drilled water into one end while pumping brine at the other. Like oil coys do.

8536 2018-10-22 07:21:07 The 3rd paragraph from the bottom is a great concern. Can't trust big oil and gas to do the right thing when profits are on the line, especially when they have the cover of a president who shows little to no regard for environmental protections or the safety of the water supply.
8537 2018-10-22 07:20:55 I love putting rosehip oil on my face before bed
8538 2018-10-22 07:20:46 I don’t trust anything #NTOG releases. Still burning cash in high oil environment - doubt these assets are anything special

8540 2018-10-22 07:20:01 I’m also not arguing for a school without rules or sanctions, which is clear from my comments. Schools are not immune to fads and snake oil either.
8541 2018-10-22 07:19:59 Delta beyond oil is stupidity and insults to God who has blessed us. Plz collaborate with investors and give us state owned refinery. Let's build our state with state made money. Introduce practicals like basic electricity in our primary school, let our kidz get fired up!

8546 2018-10-22 07:18:43 China was poor when they were communist; they have embraced capitalism & prospered. To see what state control via socialism can do to a country, see Venezuela. They are eating garbage & zoo animals for survival. A country with huge oil deposits.

8549 2018-10-22 07:18:27 Of course NOT! America does not buy  oil from Saudi Arabia. It is sold to India and China. If there were to lower their output, then America would have to raise prices, but American oil companies have a win-win situation.
8550 2018-10-22 07:18:26 Masepa fela! With all that oil bamoshile with policies that made no sense at all!
8551 2018-10-22 07:18:14 A girlfriend gave me Lavender oil today coz she reckons it will promote relaxation in me lol is any of this true? If so, how so? I'm an evidence based guy. Have to admit it smells mad though 
8552 2018-10-22 07:18:11 This is another corporate neanderthal like Air India, HAL etc. What is their track record in exploration, discovery of oil wells etc. Financials can look wonderful if on their horrendous cost a mark up is added and paid.

8554 2018-10-22 07:17:59 And did he tell Delhi govt charges highest VAT on oil in India?
8555 2018-10-22 07:17:54 Always, the focus on Bertie Armstrong,  the biggest mouth but not representative of ALL the Scottish Fishing Industry.  With the amount of holdings he has, you might as well be highlighting Sir Ian Wood frae Oil! ( Sardines come in Oil!)

8558 2018-10-22 07:17:38 may be right but look at him , he was the advisor of the president , why their govt not took the initiative to stop it, if pakistan is in grey list , the previous governments are more responsible

8565 2018-10-22 07:16:32 Have u watched those mzungu at Somalia coastline bragging they got Oil...so sad..I wish we ca have another leader like him in Africa
8566 2018-10-22 07:16:27 Not to mention drinkable water...how many die everyday from non potable water?  Man sets value of things.  The idea that data is the most valuable resource after Oil shows where technocratic man is at regarding humanity.

And
Dr.Singh charged Rs71/litre against crude oil price of $108/barrel 
Still people say rate of fuels during congress regime very high...

In the words of Modi ji
"Hipocrisy ki bhi seema hota hai mitro..."
8569 2018-10-22 07:15:55 It really takes alot of strength to put your feelings aside for someone and to realize what’s best for you. Water and oil don’t mix no matter how hard you try
8570 2018-10-22 07:15:47 I'm so glad you care about biological science. Can't wait to see you become an advocate for getting rid of coal/gas/oil/plastic dependency that speeding up global warming. Because idk if you know but that is actually an important issue to spend hours of work on.
8571 2018-10-22 07:15:44 Saudi Royalty set to takeover Man United - it will be hilarious after all the criticism City got for being boosted by "oil money"
8572 2018-10-22 07:15:21 Who knows where I can get jojoba oil in Ibadan? It’s urgent
8573 2018-10-22 07:15:15 So much easier to put parboiled potatoes into preheated oil in roasting pan and shake. Bizarre

8575 2018-10-22 07:14:52 Malcolm was not the PROBLEM.

COAL & GAS exports then importing Diesel Petroleum OIL. is total insanity.

8580 2018-10-22 07:13:45 lol so funny cause I got a fat tub of coco oil at the dollar tree yesterday 
8581 2018-10-22 07:13:44 Yesss!!!
Could you also do:
1. How to jump start a car
2. How to replace wiper blades
3. How to replace headlights
4. How to change the oil

These were the things I had to learn and was like... the fuck is that?
8582 2018-10-22 07:13:40 He’s paid to block laws and to rig agencies that would restrict oil industry act, like drilling, fracking, refining, and pipelines.

8585 2018-10-22 07:13:19 The root is simple @Busisa74 accepted there is shortage of raw materials because of shortage and they were told to source their own forex and we expect them to sell the oil at 1:1 no even dm @RModiByoSouth is now selling some of products in usd to cushion the damage. 1:1 cancer.
8586 2018-10-22 07:13:19 But you are ignoring pollution created by power generation. No EV is “pure” and as good for the environment as telecommuting, except in those few areas where power comes from hydro-nuclear instead of coal, oil, and gas generators.
8587 2018-10-22 07:13:17 Also #Spar Supermarket in #Kwekwe wants
customers to first buy $15 worth of goods before

serious about our suffering? Why can't they act on
illegal activities that everyone can witness?
Suspicious! @SPARint
8588 2018-10-22 07:13:12 Why do you add "black female" and "white male" to name them? What's the point? You can't just talk about people as human beings in the first place?
Hell no! This is so much easier to put oil on fire saying every issue is related to race or gender.
Hope you'll choke on a dick,man
8589 2018-10-22 07:13:04 Also looking thru the comments he said that big oil didn't have a monopoly in the late 19th century when is just laughable he believes that. He came of as a bad actor

Indonesia might fix it and have a 7-6 or higher win against UAE (that is not in good terms politically with Qatar) and leave Qatar outside. The fearless leader Pak Edy can lead the negotiations!
8596 2018-10-22 07:12:13 Seen a lot of #MUFC fans on Twitter saying they don’t want this Saudi takeover and that we don’t need their money we can just ‘access’ our own.. that being the main issue! If it means getting the Glazers out then inject that Halal oil money in to my veins! #AllahuAkbar

8618 2018-10-22 07:09:06 Milk is 87% water and 13% dry substance. This dry substance include fat, oil, enzymes, pigments, gases. When the water and substance mix we say they have emulsified. I'm sure you know that word. That's why we get fat and ghee from milk.

Just sad.
8629 2018-10-22 07:05:58 Who told you Africans commit crime all over the world?

The invaders support crimes
8630 2018-10-22 07:05:39 What does the unemployment statistics from 1999to 2015 say? What does revenue from sales of oil and other resources say from 1999 to 2015? Y'all act like problems started in this administration when they were created and peaking during the 16 years of PDP.

8657 2018-10-22 06:59:26 I could tell when my dad got an oil change done in my car...not because the oil, but because they cleaned the glass and it’s streaky as fuck when light hits it at certain angles. took me days to get the streaks out before. Smdh.

8671 2018-10-22 06:56:02 They're buying arms not from a position of strength, but a position of weakness. Saudi Arabia has overextended it's hand in the region over Syria, Yemen, Qatar, etc following the 2008 credit crisis, and their dwindling oil supply. We're not desperate to sell, they are to buy.
8672 2018-10-22 06:56:00 Bullshit has now overtaken oil as the principal Saudi Arabia export.

8674 2018-10-22 06:55:14 Can't draw parallel with China. China is a military & economic heavyweight. U.S. can't "punish" China militarily; through sanction — yes
KSA is US's undeclared colony. US manages her oil resources, sells massive volume of arms. KSA is the 2nd biggest arms importer after India. +

8749 2018-10-22 06:41:38 If the rand was stable & OPEC was not raising the prices of crude oil our price would be around R14/l. We have to pay that price for choices we have made as country e.g. grants, no fee schools, public health care, housing & RAF. Other countries Like Nigeria have fuel subsidies.

8774 2018-10-22 06:39:12 Well, synthetics rely on it to make equipment to drill and manufacture parts. Currently, any engine that uses oil outpowers something that needs to be plugged to do the work.
8775 2018-10-22 06:39:11 Saudi Arabia is using this buyer power, not just weapons, to supplant their dwindling seller power of oil products. They are also more clever than the Netanyahu government, who has pretty much locked themselves in with the Republican party.

8804 2018-10-22 06:35:53 Could all be a plan to drive up oil prices.  With the U.S. pressing for increased output wouldnt it just be thinking outside the box to use any imposed retaliation as excuse to raise oil prices?  Hmmmm, $$$ would be filling up the bank of Saud then!

8808 2018-10-22 06:34:07 I hope like hell you're right. But no matter what happens, we can never take our freedoms & democracy for granted again. So much is at stake now. Our very existence depends on shutting the oil/gas oligarchs down before there's nothing left to save.

8811 2018-10-22 06:33:20 It's wasting my money stealing oil for oligarchs that will never and have never helped anyone I've ever known.
It's turning our allies against us and undermining our nation abroad.

It's pure self interest.

8814 2018-10-22 06:33:04 @mufon must start taking responsibility, having Corey Goode sat next to @RichDolan was absurdity. The snake oil disclosure movement is destroying genuine research.

8816 2018-10-22 06:32:29 4/ It is extremely important that we recognise this fact as a clear act of Ecological sabotage, where we all know that Oil & Gas pulled the strings while GM carried out their demands. It is simply not good enough to attempt to paint out the reasons and those responsible so please
8817 2018-10-22 06:32:25 The TRUTH hasONLY one answer. The rest is a cover up and corruption . Oil prices ,arms sales , and of course the U.S. Foreign policy to protect the fake wall street.
8818 2018-10-22 06:32:15 @gmbutts I hope 2000 Canadians won't lose their jobs over this nasty Saudi business. I believe it would hurt the Saudis more if we stop buying their oil. Canada has oil. Plus taxpayers own a pipeline.  But first we need all the facts.

8821 2018-10-22 06:31:51 What if I told you that we buy lots of oil from Saudi Arabia? Who is going to bring that issue up to Canadiens? I'm not saying the arms deal should not be looked at or cancelled but at least we're making a buck with it. Buying Saudi oil instead of investing in ourselves is silly.

8831 2018-10-22 06:30:09 McKinsey & Co.  Basically a right-wing management consulting company that makes a lot of money from Saudi Arabia.  A large portion of their income comes from Saudi Aramco the international oil company.  An American company that does not always have American interests at heart.

8837 2018-10-22 06:28:45 This bullshit about "regime change for human rights" is all made up so they can implement US friendly governments that will allow the US to profit from the oil. 7 countries in 5 years.
8838 2018-10-22 06:28:34 They are trying to fool you into hating Julian and Russia since they are both the enemy of the military industrial complex. Julian is trying to expose the corruption and Russia is the enemy that they are competing for over oil.

8847 2018-10-22 06:27:43 @theJagmeetSingh could you also have @JustinTrudeau stop importing Saudi oil and refine Canadian oil in Canada? Would be a good start for sovereignty. Be less reliant on the USA and OPEC. Maybe Canada could join OPEC!
8848 2018-10-22 06:27:27 It does not matter to the U.S. since america is biggest oil producer in the world. Saudi Arabia will have to look to China if it wants to punch back for U.S. sanctions.

8863 2018-10-22 06:25:05 I guess KSA merged the base of this relationship between the perspective of “oil finance forces” & “weapon purchasing power”..
As USA has lots of competitive ENEMIES in this field..

Long live KSA

8870 2018-10-22 06:23:58 What ever may be the price of petrol in 2014 or 2018 all amount earned during the low price of crude oil. Our country has repaid the lot of debts. If we go on passing the money one day India will become a bankrupt country like pakistan

8875 2018-10-22 06:22:16 Just ran into a YCH commission with two separate characters that were both over $900 to claim. That’s a little outrageous. It’s not like a Leonardo da Vinci painting that uses oil points on a traditional canvas. Can someone explain why they’re charging so much?
8876 2018-10-22 06:22:08 Yes my country’s relationship with KSA is a disgrace, guessing yours still buys their oil though. My country isn’t a corporate tax haven enabling the parasitising of public services across the whole of Europe affecting tens of millions of the poorest people though.

8887 2018-10-22 06:20:40 As crude oil prices fell from 108$ a barrel in May 2014 to less than 30$, not a single penny of relief was passed on to the common man.

Instead Modi Govt increased excise duty on petrol by more than 200%, on diesel by more than 440%.

This is daylight robbery.

That man is beyond the pale; not just un-American, he's undeniably anti-American.  Pls let me know if you cut him off.

8975 2018-10-22 06:04:43 I was thinking about how unscientific it is for a newspaper to say that cannabis oil helped a child with seizures.  “Studies show” is what my German double PhD hippie from Bavaria told me sells.

8989 2018-10-22 06:01:55 20yrs ago the people of Turkana might not have asked for a share of the oil revenues from the wells in the area. Today they are aware of their rights, they fought like hell to get a cut on the revenue. More counties are taking the same path.

Saudi Arabia says 'no intention' to repeat 1973-style oil embargo:

Saudi Arabia has no intention of unleashing a 1973-style oil embargo on Western consumers and will isolate oil from politics, the Saudi energy minister said on Monday.

8991 2018-10-22 06:01:50 I’ve heard the name essential oils a lot, especially from your  timeline :-) but I don’t know exactly what they are. Is it like lotion? Or are they oil’s that you burn? Others have suggested things like meditation, etc. to me but that crap doesn’t work on me.
8992 2018-10-22 06:01:35 Paling tak boleh bawa bincang dekat muka ni sebaceous filaments dan parut jerawat. Kadang pening kepala fikir nak pakai produk apa lagi sebab cleansing oil dah pakai pun still masih ada sedikit sebaceous filaments. 
8993 2018-10-22 06:01:33 "Apparently so... it's not looking good. It's probablt burning a ton of oil... guhhh. Might have to swap the engine out, I don't wanna deal with such a mess..." 

And she'd crawl back out from underneath, wiping her forehead. 

"Hehe, you were right~."
8994 2018-10-22 06:01:32 subsidies cause gdb growth, so they don't reduce greenhouse gas emissions. carbon pricing, cap and trade, and taxes encourage increased greenhouse gas emissions, because of the fringe benefits of prices, trade, and taxes. my epiphany is to tear up an oil company business license.
8995 2018-10-22 06:01:31 Inflation rate going way out of control in Venezuela though it’s one of the top oil exporters and global 1st place in oil reserve!
8996 2018-10-22 06:01:23 Instead of your vitriol, go visit Middle America, go see where your food comes from, where oil, gas for your vehicles come from, go see where so much of what you have in your life gives you the lifestyle you have, go visit the hard working Americans in rural and Middle America.

9005 2018-10-22 05:59:35 My prayer for Nigeria.

1. We must rightly and adequately restructure in the manner that favorably promotes true federalism; or

2. We dismember peacefully. The only reason there is a geographical space called Nigeria is simply because oil still flows in the Southern Nigeria.
9006 2018-10-22 05:59:28 Yes it will. Just open it, air it. The oil in the package is silicon and it's to stop them sticking to the package.
9007 2018-10-22 05:59:20 You are avoiding the Indian massacre argument. Usa was actually a fabricated identity to seduce, cheat and oppress the masses in the world. With fake news media (CNN-BBC), with exploiting land multinationals oil companies, with multimedia movies in order to make them looking good
9008 2018-10-22 05:59:07 Nice bear messages circulated during weekend in Mumbai. But the fact is oil is cooling and rupee improving so the markets have no choice but to perform on upside.

9035 2018-10-22 05:53:53 And does the east still buy oil from them when have ethical environmentally friendly drill oil from western Canada?
9036 2018-10-22 05:53:52 China tax-cuts, softening oil prices, capital inflow boost & ramping up domestic consumption. Our auto-increase economic activities is about to begin next year.
9037 2018-10-22 05:53:41 Except big oil companies bribe too many politicians for America to benefit from that alternative energy. Maybe Canada and some other countries could benefit though. Won't be seeing it in my country for a long while though.

9042 2018-10-22 05:51:16 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
9043 2018-10-22 05:51:14 From the Governor’s office to the legislature, R’s have run this state into the ground for the past 8 years. Tax cuts for oil & gas while having budget deficits & zero funding for education. Hello?! We have EARTHQUAKES in Oklahoma! Stitt is more of the same.

9157 2018-10-22 05:22:55 Refining Margins have plummeted from around $ 10 in Mid August to just around $ 4 with a greater fall in Petrol Margins.
This is normally a precursor of lower Crude Oil Prices as refining demand falls in the following weeks.

Damn. Trump is a f'ing badass 
9160 2018-10-22 05:22:11 @cenkuygur What is your take on this?: Trump's sinking of the Iran nuclear deal has nothing to do with Obama, but that he is corrupt, he wanted to drive oil prices up, so the Saudis can get that 2BN$ evaluation for Saudi Aramco, which had taken a nose dive when oil price fall.
9161 2018-10-22 05:22:01 And by the way, it was Bill Clinton who allowed Russia to build their oil and gas pipelines into Europe that led to all this. Reagan warned him and the world not to allow it when he left office.

9182 2018-10-22 05:18:31 So don't blame it on Trump. He didn't cause it. The whole thing began during the Obama Administration on the heals of his Arab Spring. It, and the Syrian civil war, is actually about gas and oil pipelines to Europe from Qatar and the Saudis to take Russias influence off Europe.

9234 2018-10-22 05:09:17 We don't rely on oil, we are a great kingdom, we have a political dimension, Strategic dimension, a religious dimension and finally an economic dimension, you are without us "NOTHING" in most of the world.
9235 2018-10-22 05:09:07 How is the junket going? Still won't face up to the workers whose jobs you are costing in Tarankai but happy to jet up your air miles and not worried about using an oil fueled plane to get there. So hypocritical and shameful particularly posting this on Labour Day @nzlabour
9236 2018-10-22 05:09:01 I lost my @TataHarper face oil when we were moving and am so sad because it was my fav and I honestly can’t afford to replace it for awhile

13. To ensure Turkana County residents reap the maximum benefits from the exploration of oil in their county
9244 2018-10-22 05:06:41 It is self-renewable. An oil well can be dried, only to be filled if it is left in peace for a period of time that will depend on several factors but rarely exceeds a few years. Oil is not scarce, it is just another trick to exploit the population. ~Swaruu
9245 2018-10-22 05:06:19 On Earth they are told that oil is a non-renewable fossil fuel of organic origin. This is a big lie. Petroleum is a mineral generated by complex chemical-thermo-mechanical interactions within the crust of a planet.
9246 2018-10-22 05:06:05 They dismembered him alive. But we'll say nothing because we depend on their oil.
9247 2018-10-22 05:05:25 This assassination was not thought out by the perpetrators, US isn't the only country Saudis have to worry about. Saudis may have just given the rest of the world the catalyst they need to break from oil dependency. Khashoggi death may trigger the downfall of OPEC!
9248 2018-10-22 05:05:19 Vetiver essential oil is something I’ve lovingly nicknamed “big guns”. It’s promotes calming, grounding, and seriously feels like it tells my nervous system to STFU. Perfect for anxiety, trauma, and grief. I’m a fan.

9253 2018-10-22 05:04:57 How are you going to force the market to do your bidding?

The federal govt tried repeatedly to bring western oil to the east in the 60's, 70's and 80's. Alberta threw an absolute fit, cried "communism" and insisted on selling all the oil to the US

Too late now.

9261 2018-10-22 05:04:07 There you go with this conspiracy theory stuff again. 

It undermines your argument. 

You seem to blame one industry for answering the needs of the market. 

I am sure you have no oil derived products in your household, but most can’t afford not to use the benefits they bring.

9282 2018-10-22 05:01:08 Heat the oil in a 3-quart (or larger) saucepan on medium-high heat, You'll want to use an oil with a high smoke point, like peanut, canola or coconut, If using coconut oil, allow all of the solid oil to melt before adding kernels.

9348 2018-10-22 04:52:47 Wow that really sucks. We don’t have the same issue with warranties here. Oil change, inspection, tire roatation, and top off fluids costs $40 at the dealership.  I’m sure this varies though based off make, model, and location.
9349 2018-10-22 04:52:47 Oil prices in Noida, Ghaziabad are around Rs 3 cheaper than Delhi. AAP govt is responsible for higher petrol and diesel prices in Delhi. @nytimes @ndtv @CNNnews18 @htTweets
9350 2018-10-22 04:52:40 Still haven’t got my oil changed
9351 2018-10-22 04:52:25 She wasn’t around then. Not on Netflix I’m guessing. Not that she would know, of course, as she lives an oil free life, 
9352 2018-10-22 04:52:24 Oil prices rose on Monday as markets were expected to tighten once U.S. sanctions against Iran's crude exports are implemented next month.
9353 2018-10-22 04:52:11 Still don't see why it is so hard to believe human life is affecting the globe in a negative way. Someday those oil reserves will dry up and those nuclear plants will have meltdowns and we will be back to cooking shit on a fire pit and using animal skins to keep warm.
9354 2018-10-22 04:51:54 @MthuliNcube  when are you removing the bondnote?. We as the ordinary civilians are tired already. Sleepless nights thinking of where to queue for fuel, cooking oil,bread. Please act fast. We are being economically raped. This should stop now.
9355 2018-10-22 04:51:42 @SamSeder Will you please get @VerminSupreme onto @majorityfm (maybe in a Fun Half) to discuss his platform of friendly fascism, teeth brushing, free (mandatory) ponies, and zombie labor to solve the oil crisis?

or @_michaelbrooks on @tmbsfm ?

9365 2018-10-22 04:49:39 Earnings from fuel taxes have been provisioned to pay of the 1.5 lac crore Oil bonds issued during the UPA rule. Policy paralysis is not just land acquisition, but also project clearances, do read about Jayanti tax and who was remote controlling these project clearances.
9366 2018-10-22 04:49:29 That oil money does wonders
9367 2018-10-22 04:49:29 "broke the camel's back" yeah that's some bad press I guess, but in terms of the camels that matter? they still seem perfectly happy being fed on backdoor oil money and political favors from their favorite medieval sand dune slave capital
9368 2018-10-22 04:49:28 You may be a tomboy, but you're a girl ... or I'm a boy too. I don't do "helpless," I love collecting tools and climbing trees. I can take apart and fix computers, change a tire, change the oil, and I replaced the clutch cable on my '76 VW Van. We're amazing, is what I'm saying.

9374 2018-10-22 04:48:52 @tjohara74 President Trump is trying to improve relations with Canada and supportive of the proposed pipeline across Canada. The provinces are currently looking at one thru BC.  Canada has more oil,  resources - to produce oil and other resources. Done with impeccable precision.
9375 2018-10-22 04:48:40 If you're looking for a really good documentary, check out @CBC The Fifth Estate on TransCanada Oil pipeline. It's on @YouTube and spends half the episode discussing Nebraska and talking to those who oppose the project.
9376 2018-10-22 04:48:40 That’s a lie of the devil and a temptation to bring division.  When sleeps anoint his mind with oil and pray that no weapon formed against your marriage prosper.   You’ve got to pray for him.
9377 2018-10-22 04:48:29 Exactly, not to mention the disease they could possibly bring. My husband & I have a crew of 5 men. They are from Mexico. They do oil well maintenance. Some of the hardest working men I have ever seen. Respected by all who know them. They keep their work visas current.I wish

9394 2018-10-22 04:46:25 There are plenty of suppliers who would willingly step up to provide supply to US and diminish Saudi oil business. It’s quite a diverse supply economy now as opposed to the 70/80s
9395 2018-10-22 04:46:25 Mean while my hand was covered in transmission oil tgat smelled like dorian
9396 2018-10-22 04:46:17 At macro level the world is moving towards e cars . So crude oil future price portends to be lower.
9397 2018-10-22 04:46:11 Maybe we should stop using oil, given it's destroying the world anyway?
9398 2018-10-22 04:46:11 I'll never understand anyone who pretends climate change isn't real. Like they somehow benefit from denying it. Are there really this many oil and coal CEOs out there? Because if not, you're only hurting yourself with your denials.
9399 2018-10-22 04:45:51 a rise in oil means a rise in standard of living coz it's majorly used aa factor production across economic sectors

9403 2018-10-22 04:44:53 We used to need oil from Saudi Arabia but now we produce more crude oil than we need domestically!

9405 2018-10-22 04:44:04 If we restructured, away from oil, this would become apparent
9406 2018-10-22 04:44:04 Saudi monarchy is collapsing anyway, they are economically screwed and that’s math. Peak oil production in KSA is around 11mbd, today they need 3mbd for domestic demand and in 2025 around 5mbd and in 2030 around 7mbd. Kicking the can down the road is useless.

9413 2018-10-22 04:42:46 She is either a hypocrite, or they are using the “C” Team to negotiate with Big Oil. It could be both, I suppose. Big Oil’s biggest fear is stranded assets and the infrastructure that goes with it. So the Liberals use our money to take some of it off their hands.

9426 2018-10-22 04:40:26 i would also argue that "reasonable prices" for oil are prices that take into account the inevitable cost of climate change resulting from burning it (i.e. much much more expensive than it is now)

9435 2018-10-22 04:38:34 We don't need the oil prices to go down, we need to reduce our dependency on fossil fuel. 

To a large degree we have, The Western and world economy is far less dependent on oil, and Saudi oil, than it used to be. Something that has led to a scramble for other sources of power.

I agree that private investment should build refineries and pipelines but govt needs to reduce regulatory process.

9486 2018-10-22 04:30:48 You are buying fuel on the black market, money on the black market, cooking oil black market. Someone offers to SORT out the mess, You remember “Due process and constitution” If this is what “education” does then let’s reconsider

9491 2018-10-22 04:30:19 Is cannabis legal where you live? Many people I know here in the states use CBD oil to help them sleep. It doesn’t get you high. It just relaxes your mind and body so you can sleep.

9493 2018-10-22 04:30:07 So if Mexican authorities can't stop unarmed invaders can we expand our boarder a little farther south? Pick up some beach front property and oil rigs to pay for a wall?
9494 2018-10-22 04:29:37 Gov’t should immediately mandate an increase in CME blend in diesel from 2% to 5%. This results in at least 3 upsides: more coconut oil being used locally for cleaner energy; reduced diesel importations; and less pollution with reduced hydrocabon emissions. MOVE IT, @doe_ph!!!
9495 2018-10-22 04:29:32 i never said it was all of them. but as long as its a portion of them, and considering human trafficking stats i think thats a pretty large portion, i will still criticize the industry. just like how i criticize other industries (oil, construction, videogame, whatever)

9500 2018-10-22 04:28:20 We need Saudi for oil? To keep sea lanes open? Intelligence? Economic or political support? Do you really have proof we need them for this? I doubt it, because we don't.
9501 2018-10-22 04:28:20 Ain’t nobody moving either they all acting like there eyes helping clean up that oil spill
9502 2018-10-22 04:28:19 If you like chicken, it's not too hard. Just get pre-sliced and fry it in a pan with olive oil. Then take em out and throw in some broccoli to sautee! All the while, boil some rice~

9506 2018-10-22 04:27:39 @McFaul You asked earlier, to paraphrase, what has the KSA ever done for America. I gave you 3 major policies/actions but failed to mention that they'd also made a major contribution in bankrupting the USSR by manipulating oil prices. See Peter Schweitzer's "Victory."

9514 2018-10-22 04:26:22 I agree.  The rule has been he who has the oil makes the rules. This way as long as I can remember (I'm 57)
9515 2018-10-22 04:26:06 Me too, I would rather but a few cases of @corona  and have a BBQ with all my people!!!!!
9516 2018-10-22 04:25:47 Pamela, this is what they show you in the media. Guess why...@crypt0an0n tell that to your kids when bombs are over their head. And we all know that this is about who is taking control of...the oil. I don't think we can understand the magnitude of their tragedy. All of us.
9517 2018-10-22 04:25:41 Hope they have oil
9518 2018-10-22 04:25:37 This is not benefiting from AZ dying oil industry when the whole world is investing in clean energy.  We liberated Artsakh to not have the Armenian Genocide and what Azerbaijan did to Nakhjevan to repeat in Artsakh.
9519 2018-10-22 04:25:34 Bio oil katanya bisa
9520 2018-10-22 04:25:29 The government doesn’t import oil. Shouldn’t you be petitioning Irving Oil?
9521 2018-10-22 04:25:21 I agree refining our own oil would be great, but @srheth is right - the economics do not make sense. Massive government incentives would be needed to convince private industry to invest, and then taxpayers would be on hook for the inevitable losses.
9522 2018-10-22 04:25:15 The Unites States has in reserve enough oil to last 30 years.  We have our own exploration, you are not the only part of the world we can get oil from.

9524 2018-10-22 04:25:08 You can't believe nothing the Saudis say. He had this done and he has enough money and oil to do what ever he wants to do. And if you don't want the price of oil to go through the roof you need to let it alone. This is how the Saudis do it &they have done it since time has begun.
9525 2018-10-22 04:24:53 was planning on frying something when i deadass put dishwashing liquid instead of cooking oil in the pan ........... this really aint it :/
9526 2018-10-22 04:24:34 For coating dredge in mayonnaise not egg  
Use cajun season salt
Cook meat @ room temp
Heat your oil to level 7, wait till it's HOT before putting in meat. Leave it there to cook about 5 mins before flipping. Don't mess with it too much. 
pre-boil chicken in salt = really tender

9531 2018-10-22 04:24:03 You say, he don't understand because he lives in the United States, but I do its reall because of money, more specifically, OIL.   Let you know upfront if shit hits the fan. next message.
9532 2018-10-22 04:24:01 I know what you say. I'm a person failed by systems set in place for a fail. Ive often wished I were an animal. Haha! Jk... 

Js truth... MI water issue is BS. Pipelines for oil seem more important to those so called important.
9533 2018-10-22 04:23:42 i've always heard about that "coconut oil being a multipurpose oil" thing but i don't know how true that is
like if you have a headache, rub some coconut oil on it, if your eyes're hurting rub some coconut oil on it etc

9542 2018-10-22 04:21:58 Sorry commodities and stocks traders dont fail. Don’t be mad at me that all you could do in life is be an airborne infantry lmfao. Love trading oil.
9543 2018-10-22 04:21:53 Arvind ji . When ever the  oil price increases , the state govt also get more money. If center govt @narendramodi ji is not reducing then state govt can reduce from his share. @govt_delhi enjoying more fund but cursing central govt unnecessarily. What a crook mentality !
9544 2018-10-22 04:21:52 The appointment is significant.I hope he can influence for the country to get enough funding to complete Lapset n the oil pipeline to lamu.

9548 2018-10-22 04:20:54 The point is that the GOP is also not focusing on this issue that you want to attack the left with. That’s like yelling at someone about polluting a river while dumping oil into an ocean.  It is just a method to attack. And not a very good one at that.

9560 2018-10-22 04:19:20 Shit shit shit shit shit  I was trying to dump remnant  cooking oil into the designated "Grease pig" jar that has been quarantined out on our apartment balcony due to the horrifying stench it unleashes. I dropped the cap and it rolled off the balcony and I can't find it.

9565 2018-10-22 04:18:00 Why Hondurans and Guatemalans leaving their country.

9567 2018-10-22 04:17:53 Consider that Norway is much closer to being functional post fossil fuels, has a large sovereign wealth fund rather than govt debt, and produces more than 3x the oil per capita Canada does. 
We can't build pipelines, get world prices AND put $ towards renewables?
9568 2018-10-22 04:17:39 I just switched back to LOC, my hair is a hot bougie mess  I have to switch between the LOC & LCO method. I’ve been using Kinky Curly’s leave in, olive oil sometimes mixed with tea tree oil, & Cantu’s curl activator cream but I need to try new products asap

9575 2018-10-22 04:16:20 You are acting like that’s something to be proud of. Dumping dirty coal water, shrinking natural parks, increases coal and oil business while targeting and hurting renewable energy, the red tide in Florida, etc.... #voteblue #BlueWave2018
9576 2018-10-22 04:16:19 The rest of the world should freeze all Saudi assets and arms deals until the pack of killers who committed this crime are locked up.

9578 2018-10-22 04:16:11 US Coast Guard is the lead federal agency for offshore oil spills (and was extensively referenced in this article). EPA is  the lead for inland oil spills.

9588 2018-10-22 04:14:53 Yeah, I just switched to the LOC method a month ago. So I use my Maui she’s butter leave in, then use my oil blend (mostly castor and almond oil and whatever else my hair might need atm) and then I use the Eden hydrating custard.  I love it so much, a dream

9592 2018-10-22 04:14:12 Too late for the carrier. Offsetting internal costs is a symptom of rising oil prices, intense competition from IndiGo, Vistara snatching market share, stranded planes and rising leasing costs. All of these things need to be seen beforehand. Mkt share maintenance makes you blind.
9593 2018-10-22 04:14:06 This is not a genuine shortage-driven "inflation". We have enough cooking oil, we have enough meat, its cruel business people causing missery to the suffering masses by withholding product in order to hike prices. So 2 weeks ago we were ok, then 2 weeks later its "hyperinflation"
9594 2018-10-22 04:13:54 Took castor oil, did the bm dance, walked 30 minutes on the treadmill and did squats all after work tonight. This baby BETTER come.
9595 2018-10-22 04:13:54 Their would be a surplus if both Bush administrations didn't touch it to pay for wars. They should be made to put it back out of all the millions they made of the oil. After all we entered a war to control oil, by one bush, and the other sent us into a war under false pretenses

9611 2018-10-22 04:11:57 I don't know what you're using right now but a castor oil is probably your best bet or seal with shea butter ( try castor oil on the entire strand and Shea towards the ends for Extra  sealing)

9624 2018-10-22 04:11:15 Castor oil is great for everything

9626 2018-10-22 04:10:58 Achievable once Tullow oil revovers their oil profit.29-39 yers from now
9627 2018-10-22 04:10:56 My oil paint has... how do i say this... peed on my thigh
9628 2018-10-22 04:10:48 Yes let's drill the earth where ground water is and cause earthquakes for geothermal or use solar panels to absorb 22% of light into energy with batteries you cannot dispose. We can kill birds with turbines and heat the earth too.  build these using oil too cuz we have to.
9629 2018-10-22 04:10:43 Maybe USA doesn’t like the fact that Saudi kingdom likely to sell oil to china in yuan instead of usd? They have blown up every country who has touted that idea before.

9631 2018-10-22 04:10:18 How My Father's Sickness Brought a Love of an Oil Lantern
9632 2018-10-22 04:10:16 If only we’d have bombed the correct country most responsible for 9-11. Here’s for second chances to get it right, & yes, the I’m all for stealing their oil. R’s said this was cool with the other brown people so I surmise little push back.
9633 2018-10-22 04:10:11 ブレーキランプ5回点滅、ごま油のサイン。
9634 2018-10-22 04:10:08 Double cleanse (use an oil first- if you don’t wanna buy a separate cleansing oil, straight up olive oil works wonders- then regular cleanser) & exfoliate once or twice a week
9635 2018-10-22 04:10:06 I find it unusual that the current Automotive Manufacturers have not considered EV Power Plants as just another power plant to add to their list of options, are the Oil Companies big shareholders, blocking that progression?
9636 2018-10-22 04:10:01 Political patronage via oil money for arms.    A tale as old as the kingdom itself.
9637 2018-10-22 04:09:58 what's wrong with slamming cooking oil all over a tree branch 
9638 2018-10-22 04:09:58 I have mink oil I might try on them.
9639 2018-10-22 04:09:40  I wanna share the way i clean my face it’s really important. I had to face with acne for years and it’s like a nightmare  i usually use makeup remover oil before using cleanser even when I don’t makeup. That tip from an owner of organic cosmetics store.
9640 2018-10-22 04:09:39 Coconut Oil changed me as a person
9641 2018-10-22 04:09:35 Ohh thank you that’s good to know! I’ve never used castor oil for anything in my life haha
9642 2018-10-22 04:09:14 Come on @VanJones68, don't waste your time. How is this going to move the needle? We already know they're ill-equipped liars; this event won't possibly reveal anything we don't already painfully know. And they're certainly not going to listen to oil concerns. Just don't bother...
9643 2018-10-22 04:09:11 IEA chief Birol not worried about Saudi oil supply cuts over journalist's death
9644 2018-10-22 04:08:51 Side note about the castor oil. I’ve found heating it up with coconut oil or olive oil thins it a little so it doesn’t pull my hair when I wash it out. Straight castor oil is pretty sticky.
9645 2018-10-22 04:08:48 Yes, Erik we are. That will cause them to improve. They can't eat or drink the oil.
9646 2018-10-22 04:08:34 I always wash my mugs... But the French press goes a week or two () with only a daily rinse. 'Cause all that oil in there is flavor, and don't tell me can go rancid, I need my caffeine faster than I need my logic.
9647 2018-10-22 04:08:25 The castor oil one feels the most hydrating to me so far, but I haven’t tried argan so maybe not. I only use olive oil in my hair when I’m doing clay washes
9648 2018-10-22 04:08:18 Bc when the tRump regime wanted to destroy all states w a coastline to line their own pockets w oil $$$, his FL co-conspirators reminded him he NEEDS Florida donors and also, MAR-A-MOSCOW is there
9649 2018-10-22 04:08:15 You are asking Oil companies to lose billions ? Good luck with that .
9650 2018-10-22 04:07:52 but anyways I forgot i had my coconut oil sitting out now I have to take that shit with me
9651 2018-10-22 04:07:47 I love my products!! But a heavier oil might be it. Miele organics is my go to. But I haven’t used masks !!
9652 2018-10-22 04:07:44 Lol, the bubble head attacks!
 Conservatism has merits.
 Anger merchants sell snake oil.
 Pick one.
9653 2018-10-22 04:07:39 Hace 2 meses le toco a mi mamá en fabrica militar, hoy le toco a mi suegro en Oil despues de mas de 40 años de trabajo. Triste realidad estamos teniendo. Fuerza a esos trabajadores que todo llega 
9654 2018-10-22 04:07:21 ربنا ييسر أمرك.
9655 2018-10-22 04:06:47 ..my first thought went to cooking oil and I'm 100% thats wrong
9656 2018-10-22 04:06:42 Spurious cooking oil has been sold in India. This being one of the major reason. People r suffering from life term diseases. Y this subject should not be debated and rectified. @republic
9657 2018-10-22 04:06:41 Sinner saved by the grace of God and the blood of Jesus Christ! Trying hard to keep my lamp filled with oil because I believe time is short. Come soon, Lord Jesus!
9658 2018-10-22 04:06:27 It’s so weird cause I use olive oil in my hair yet it doesn’t like that olive oil gel lol I haven’t tried the cannabis line yet, I wanna try castor oil one too
9659 2018-10-22 04:06:25 who would i be without my oil pen
9660 2018-10-22 04:06:15 Begich supports a Constitutional Amendment to protect the PFD.  It was Dunleavy’s Republican legislature that voted to slash it in order to pay for tax cuts for the oil corporations.
9661 2018-10-22 04:06:07 Lamp oil. Rope? DIE.
9662 2018-10-22 04:06:01 High fat diet is good if it comprises of pure cow ghee or pure coconut oil. Google ' Veeramachineni diet' . Even Dr.Hegde is a supporter of intake of good fat in limited quantities.
9663 2018-10-22 04:05:59 haven’t done an oil cleanse in a while and it is showing. do NOT look at me
9664 2018-10-22 04:05:55 then wouldn't that mean the solution is just coat it with oil 
9665 2018-10-22 04:05:53 The library smells like old spit and valve oil and this smell should be as comforting as it is...
9666 2018-10-22 04:05:52 Sesame oil or argan oil is much better.  Soaks into the skin also makes an n ice barrier film against UV rays.  UD Radar Online hiring now thanks to the magnetosphere weakening.
9667 2018-10-22 04:05:49 Precisely. Oil is a global market we don't need Saudi Arabi for it nor do we need to sell them any type of weaponry. Saudi relies on America's business. This billion $ deal is to benefit tRUmp & Jared, in addition to Boeing, Raytheon & tRUmp said nothing will get in the way
9668 2018-10-22 04:05:34 Fending off Russia, Iran and China increasing influence in middle east takes priority; US Can not afford quarrels  with Saudis at this moment. Oil Money, weapons will also influence this.
9669 2018-10-22 04:04:52 Am doing a home made avocado, lemon and olive oil mask now :)
9670 2018-10-22 04:04:51 Agreed. This conflict is trans national.  Coal and oil interests here, in Russia, and Saudi installed Trump to stop the momentum to wind and solar driven by climate change. #cyberwar
9671 2018-10-22 04:04:48 My hair hates the olive oil one too, the castor oil one gives me the prettiest wash n go. Idk I’ll try argan next and see, and the new cannabis one too
9672 2018-10-22 04:04:47 ....ehh?!//;; Where did all the chili oil go?!
9673 2018-10-22 04:04:37 You use synthetic? And how much you need usually for the oil change
9674 2018-10-22 04:04:25 i use castor oil a couple times a week (maybe i shouldn’t that often lol yikes???) but i let it set for a bit before i shower and that has helped me the most :)

9676 2018-10-22 04:03:56 Couldn't be a more deserving group of people for oil wealth. This area has been devastated by depressing economics.
9677 2018-10-22 04:03:40 His little pledge....you’d have a leg to stand on if you were capable of donating one millionth of what he has. Maybe you could take your carbon tax and donate it to the charities that are hurting since the oil price crash - that’ll get them back on their feet.
9678 2018-10-22 04:03:33 and of course like the oil meme going around
9679 2018-10-22 04:02:59 Try the argan oil one cause I used to use the olive oil one & my hair hated it
9680 2018-10-22 04:02:22 Why is everyone assuming Erdogan is going to tell the truth? Let’s not forget he’s a shelter to Islamic brotherhood and isis that the US and the Saudis are fighting!? He’s the only sole buyer of Iranian oil and challenges the US sanctions. He arrested 1600 journalist in 2016!!

9682 2018-10-22 04:02:09 Eliminate mortgage banks from the home buying process, and create a Fed Energy Sys that will lift oil, refine oil into gasoline...then provide said gas at a 4%-5% profit.
This economy will provide nearly 30 million jobs, and nearly eliminate welfare.

9691 2018-10-22 04:00:52 trump sure loves there oil money... there are plenty of more countries to do business with. why not pick qatar as a key player in the region, i lived there the people and leadership are alright.
9692 2018-10-22 04:00:51 Too funny. Better check the oil. 
9693 2018-10-22 04:00:45 I love him too but I can forget he gave ID to the illegals and he took our oil, gas and timbers. Now those very same peoples collected money and gave foods and shelters to the terrorists that killed our soldiers in Semporna. Now they are become criminals. Can you accept that
9694 2018-10-22 04:00:41 16yrs of oil boom under PDP, Nigeria earned over $783 billion in oil sales according to OPEC. Yet nothing to show. PDP, NOT AGAIN!
9695 2018-10-22 04:00:36 Ideals our politicians follow are petty parody of greed for money & power. Nothing much, nothing less. Evident they are feeding on ignorance of uneducated & poor.

9697 2018-10-22 04:00:26 At a mountain top you say? I left the country at the end of 2015 o. I lived in Abuja when the UN building was attacked, DSS HQ, Bannex Plaza, Maraba bus park, Catholic Church. Our reserves were at an all time low in the midst of an oil price of over $100.  Mountain top indeed.
9698 2018-10-22 04:00:23 I don’t know what kind of voodoo that is bc that ain’t working for me girl. I got the castor oil eco styler and it said fuck me
9699 2018-10-22 04:00:14 Another Oil Change? Don't you actually mean HAZING, Texas? "You Deserved It!" is what I was told. Years of Rawhide Hazing. ENOUGH!
9700 2018-10-22 04:00:07 He’s saying He doesn’t know them. That’s different than in Mt 7, when He says, “I never knew you.” I believe the foolish virgins (who had oil to start with) were believers who apostatized.
9701 2018-10-22 04:00:03 Vilma Lusardi's Delizie, our family's line of pasta sauce and olive oil are available for sale at our restaurant!
9702 2018-10-22 04:00:00 Thought Alberta wanted the ROC to stay out of the oil patch and let private enterprise control it?
9703 2018-10-22 03:59:44 Good question. We are more oil rich than they are.
9704 2018-10-22 03:59:35 When enough money is at stake ANY politician or corporate officer is corruptible.

9706 2018-10-22 03:59:11 Eco styler argan oil, I did my edges yesterday, went out in the winter wind today, & it’s still slicked down
9707 2018-10-22 03:59:09 Yeah its almost like our "friends" in the oil industry that trade in Saudi oil don't care about ethics.  Oh..or are you under the impression that our govt purchases oil?
9708 2018-10-22 03:58:57 Hippies understand that eco is a f!cking hoax. You ruin the earth using oil for materials to have it and and some systems like geothermal are responsible for creating a microseismic activity (Switzerland) and disturb the ecosystem eventually. Sometimes new shit just doesn't work.
9709 2018-10-22 03:58:55 Big oil in the US is strangely enough one of the biggest investors in renewable energy. Even they know it’s the future.
9710 2018-10-22 03:58:46 Mayor Gillum owned tonight's debate with his brilliant command of policy issues.  That anointing oil is still working!

9712 2018-10-22 03:58:26 OK, it's time somebody told me exactly what we need Saudi Arabia for?

Oil? Nope, we're good.

Help us with "war on terror"? Get real.

Limit Iran's influence? Not happening.

Time to cut those corrupt useless fucks loose.
9713 2018-10-22 03:58:22 As far as I can tell, Saudi is a one trick pony. Oil, and while it still has a place now, it's on its way out.

Khashoggi was concerned to keep Saudi relevant in the future, and MBS is holding on to the past.
9714 2018-10-22 03:58:17 I also gave my mom CBD oil and she knocked the fuck out 
9715 2018-10-22 03:58:09 that whole thread is full of stupidity and denial. I can't believe anyone pays him a penny to do anything other than change oil.
9716 2018-10-22 03:57:48 We're a nation of idiots when it comes to oil.
9717 2018-10-22 03:57:35 Yes definitely... Oil and Water never mix
9718 2018-10-22 03:57:13 olive oil too. I’ll get you some from Palestine
9719 2018-10-22 03:57:09 I wanna see both teams do good but really I see the oil putting to much on mc david
9720 2018-10-22 03:57:05 Hey Brett you know that east coast refineries don't have to buy Saudi oil right? They choose to. Those crooked rich friends of yours are the ones choosing to buy Saudi oil. They could buy Nfld oil or Mexican, Brazilian or Norwegian but they CHOOSE Saudi oil.
9721 2018-10-22 03:56:54 My bald self finally got some tea tree oil back
9722 2018-10-22 03:56:35 Also I second the CBD oil recommendation, especially before sleep. I find it helps me chill out a lot.
9723 2018-10-22 03:56:30 The basil sounds 1000x better even if you think parsley tasty tbh. Just a better rounded flavour with the oil and spice
9724 2018-10-22 03:56:22 Jojoba oil the GOAT. Debate the nigga who is talking to himself in your DMs.
9725 2018-10-22 03:56:13 When on the phone w my parents:

9726 2018-10-22 03:56:09 Yes! And raw honey and virgin coconut oil.

9728 2018-10-22 03:55:30 How can the USA have any relation with the country that hates them and did 9/11? Because of money and oil? Doesn’t sound very MAGA
9729 2018-10-22 03:55:29 Oklahoma wouldn’t be a bad place to live. Only if they had an oil boom
9730 2018-10-22 03:55:20 Omg the oil rig wasn't the only enclave redoubt, they had them all over and multiple were specifically stated to be in the Capitol area. That was already canon and in the fallout bible. Knock off the shit.
9731 2018-10-22 03:55:08 Castro oil me please!
9732 2018-10-22 03:55:03 Mitsubishi was an Australian sales disaster. Chrysler had a solid following and Mitsubishi took that plant and made oil burners
9733 2018-10-22 03:55:03 Throat coat is a tea. My worship team all swears by it. Steep it for fifteen minutes and add honey and, if you have it, lemon oil. Works WONDERS.
9734 2018-10-22 03:54:38 Maybe a measure of success for you is when oil companies and Canadians can benefit from a healthy industry getting competitive world prices for their energy.
9735 2018-10-22 03:54:33 I saw a product at the store called dude wipes. It's baby wipes for men. The female version was lavender so what's the male scent. Engine oil? 
9736 2018-10-22 03:54:19 if you need a good night sleep, put some lavender oil drops in your diffuser & lay your little head down& just breathe

9744 2018-10-22 03:53:29 There is no oil off the coast of California. Didn’t someone at Bethesda take a basic geology course?
9745 2018-10-22 03:53:26 Because Energy East is an export pipeline meaning not only will the unethical oil industry keep the Saudi oil tankers coming but a whole bunch more will be leaving our coast as well,.
9746 2018-10-22 03:53:19 $CEI 50% run this week.... Hopefully good news on oil

9749 2018-10-22 03:53:02 No, I am pretty sure that Red meat makes up a pretty good amount of my saturated fat intake.  Avocado Oil and Coconut Oil would rank pretty high too.  Of course, Bacon and cheese round out the remaining fat sources.

9752 2018-10-22 03:52:43 @WCTV my comment about the debate tonight with Gillum & Desantis-I want you to fact check their statements and report on your findings. Gillums statement on solar energy was totally correct and Sesantis pitched . His line modeled the Koch Bros BS that the Oil and gas dishes out
9753 2018-10-22 03:52:33 Yes. I do know that. But that was my point. If Mexico had oil , the UN wouldn’t let it be a Cesspool of government run corruption - but its also on the Mexican people to make that change.. trump tried to point some of that out and was called racist.
9754 2018-10-22 03:52:32 I posted what i do mainly under the pic. Wild growth oil works really well too

9761 2018-10-22 03:52:07 If you want $400 oil, destabilize the Middle East, push the Saudis to Russia/China, lose a $110 billion deal and thus thousands of jobs to go with it, then by all means get tough with them. What would you do if you were the president?
9762 2018-10-22 03:52:02 What products are you using right now? You may need to seal with a heavier oil. And incorporate a mask with humectants. I love soultanicals, SheScentIt and Luv Naturals for their leave-in and styling products
9763 2018-10-22 03:51:43 You may be able to sneak an LNG pipeline across Quebec. As for oil, you cannot do so.  British Columbia will eventually allow Alberta bitumen to flow out.

9766 2018-10-22 03:51:09 Who is "we"? My last name isn't Irving. Do you know the Irving's? They buy Saudi instead of Nfld oil not me. 

And since 4 times more oil is exported from Canada than is imported the whole thing becomes moot unless you want to nationalize our oil and take the free market out.
9767 2018-10-22 03:50:44 Denmark gets the majority of it’s electricity from coal, natural gas and oil. So all those e-cars will be firing up the coal plants! They committed to ridding themselves of fossil fuels by 2050, but you said we will all die if we don’t act within 12 years. So it’s all too late!

9835 2018-10-22 03:41:02 Sir rising fuel prices is un bearable. Start fuel subsidy again till the prices of crude oil comes normal. Yours early action is highly appreciated in this
9836 2018-10-22 03:40:43 @pxlsicle I hope that you get to dress many submarine sandwiches with that Wegman's sub oil! .
9837 2018-10-22 03:40:38 And there is NO way any American politician (let alone the Republicans who control government) allow for wild fluctuations in the price of oil. Sad isn't it?
9838 2018-10-22 03:40:34 I've never recovered from Gore v. Bush.  A Texas oil man vs a man committed to climate action. A man who might not have invaded Iraq for oil or to avenge his Daddy.    Think the world might be different?

9841 2018-10-22 03:40:16 everybody knows that when DT tries to formulate a clear sentence, a famous mouse dreams about being a #Democrat
9842 2018-10-22 03:40:15 The irony of "we went to iraq for oil," Is that the price of oil shot up like crazy during that war, and we didn't take any of the oil. If anything, we helped OPEC, but that war wasn't about plundering a foreign nation for its oil.

Winston, chair of economic affairs effing committee still don’t get it. We don’t have control over unpredictable world market oil prices. But govt contols tax.

So scrap fuel excise TRAIN 1 & 2.

9864 2018-10-22 03:37:46 Now demagogue will say that petrol pumps are observing strike on Modiji instructions as oil companies are controlled by central government.

"Ah... it's dirty. But can't be that bad. Lemme check oil..."
9876 2018-10-22 03:36:05 My facial care regiment is so relaxing. First I wash my face with an African soap bar. Then I scrub my face with a vanilla-almond scrub. Then I apply a charcoal mud mask for 10-15 min. Then I apply an  argan oil moisturizer that has my skin feeling like butter.

9925 2018-10-22 03:29:33 Vaya ignorancia de AMLO. Madero recibió dinero, en San Antonio, Texas, de la Shell y Standard Oil para renovarles sus concesiones al llegar a la presidencia. Por no cumplirles se hace la conjura de la emmbajada de EEUU y el golpe.

9931 2018-10-22 03:28:44 Oh nooo, that's the worst! I have some CBD oil that I take before bed sometimes that helps with anxiety.
9932 2018-10-22 03:28:17 I love that oil lol. Well not the smell!
9933 2018-10-22 03:28:07 The only thing dis guy knows is oil and gas... I have said it long time

9936 2018-10-22 03:27:45 I went with the guy with 16 years of proven civil service committed to Floridians (Gillum) and not the racist Trump puppet indebted to wealthy benefactors who'd happily wipe Florida off the map for access to its coastal oil.

9939 2018-10-22 03:26:36 I'm a fan of butter especially when it comes to popcorn. Coconut oil for the popping part though, it is awesome.
9940 2018-10-22 03:26:27 Rosehip oil, hyaluronic acid (the neutrogena line is amazing!), vitamin e, make sure to exfoliate occasionally, and in the winter months go for a thicker cream that you can spread out (cerave or ponds)
9941 2018-10-22 03:26:11 For the year-to-date, the #Rupee has fallen 13 percent, in response to higher oil prices and foreign portfolio outflows.
9942 2018-10-22 03:26:09 Trump gave the oil industry a $25 billion tax cut and our gas prices didn’t go down—prices depend on the market, not fees on oil companies. I-1631 places a fee on 80% of the WA's pollution, raises money that's required by law to help us reach mandated carbon targets. #yeson1631
9943 2018-10-22 03:26:07 You really think Abraham or Moses or Jesus or Paul were any different? Snake oil salesmen, the lot of them.
9944 2018-10-22 03:25:59 Then let them buy from China and Russia. Do I worry about oil? I sure do but...what's the alternative?
9945 2018-10-22 03:25:40 In 2015, a writer got motor bike accident in Monkey Forest. He drove at a low speed but someone spilled oil in the belokan-curam-Monkey-Forest. His injury was so severe.. :-(
9946 2018-10-22 03:25:30 I haven’t even had my car for 2 months & already need a oil change. It’s at 15%  why?
9947 2018-10-22 03:25:24 Add oil って、「火に油を注ぐ」「炎上」みたいな感じがしますね…。
9948 2018-10-22 03:24:54 そ、そんな変な動きではなかっですよww　　いや、ぐーさまにも言われたか……

9952 2018-10-22 03:24:06 Use a nonastringent toner after washing your face & I use almond oil or grape seed oil as a moisturizer
9953 2018-10-22 03:24:05 Can you answer whether we are safer or less safe without a strategic relationship with SA? How do we sanction Iranian oil without cooperation from SA? Is Israel safer if we sever our ties with SA? Have you thought through these important questions?

9955 2018-10-22 03:24:00 Does a few drums of hydraulic oil come with a new T-L?
9956 2018-10-22 03:23:56 Let them off the hook. Bush Jr let them off after 911. I think the oil industry is in to all of this right up to their necks. We have to take back our country. It has to be of the people by the people and for the people. Not of corporations. Vote out all of these republicans.

9966 2018-10-22 03:22:37 Alberta’s oil is land locked because the natives have too much say.
9967 2018-10-22 03:22:28 If #food is limited, my #dog, Edison, gets the #meal, and I go without.

A mixture of flour, water and a little bit of vegetable oil poured into a #waffle iron makes for a TERRIBLE waffle,  in my opinion... 

Luckily,  Edison and I disagree on this....

Deal was required because of mistrust. Spin how u like

9995 2018-10-22 03:18:10 Wharton must be proud to have an alumni in the Oval Office. 6 bankruptcies is bad enough, but he doesn’t understand what a trade deficit means, nor does Trump get supply & demand. He threatens any country that buys oil from Iran, then complains about rising oil prices. El Stupido

10012 2018-10-22 03:15:40 ps. If the Canadian approval process functions correctly, there will be no more pipelines. Time to stop moaning and face reality. Oil sands projects will have to be phased out, until it's both economic and environmentally feasible. That time is not now.
10013 2018-10-22 03:15:35 Yeah because Republicans don't want to deal with it. It's better to take that oil money than to actually understand and a knowledge what the scientists are saying. Do you want to be on the side that fucks up this planet? Theres no going back unless the planet does a reboot.
10014 2018-10-22 03:15:17 I will walk 500 miles and then walk 500 more. Sorry song Jumped in my head. Can we build a huge moat and fill it with flammable crude oil. And when they get close we light it on fire? What would be the over under on flight or fight on them?
