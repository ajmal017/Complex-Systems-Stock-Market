3 2018-05-29 23:58:48 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
4 2018-05-29 23:57:41 I've been riding this $CLNE train for a week now. Rocked out today during the turbulence.
Up again after hours. 
I think it's got quite a bit of steam left.
Look into it.

12 2018-05-29 23:52:00 I am so confused.  When 10-year treasury yields were 'breaking the 3% barrier' that was 'bad' for stocks.  Now that yields have retreated....it's 'bad' for stocks.  I hate when headlines chase market moves

28 2018-05-29 23:51:55 The stocks I have invested have dropped lower than they've ever been. Thanks Obama.
29 2018-05-29 23:51:32 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would?
30 2018-05-29 23:50:26 Since people ask what I want to do with my life a lot I was to be in business in stocks, negotiations, and investment. I want to be the right hand man or a CEO. I want to build an empire or complete one if that doesn’t work out engineering in technology. 
31 2018-05-29 23:50:20 Dollar and Stocks gonna tank buddy
32 2018-05-29 23:48:21 Someone just told me that banning bump stocks would have no effect on crime.

Quick reminder that bump stocks allowed one person to kill 58 and injure over 500 other people in eleven minutes.
33 2018-05-29 23:48:09 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
34 2018-05-29 23:48:00 ALL stocks were down today.

Cut it out @ReutersBiz
35 2018-05-29 23:47:16 I agree that saying "NRA" takes from the discussion.  

I always ask "What laws?" Because I am honestly curious.  Most don't make sense.

Background checks, bump stocks, things like these I can get behind.  Why can't we just focus on these things?
36 2018-05-29 23:46:31 Bearish oil stocks, despite likely a bull trap coming.
37 2018-05-29 23:44:52 So this is easy, any stocks / bonds I own for ABC/ Disney sold tomorrow.

40 2018-05-29 23:44:21 Most stocks were down because of the political situation in Italy.

42 2018-05-29 23:43:25 Colin: how did my stocks do?
Dave Rubin: uh...they all won
Colin: what about my options?
Dave: well, you can either support Roseanne or not
43 2018-05-29 23:43:16 Stocks flies out to center for 2
44 2018-05-29 23:42:14 It’s a crazy entry price
45 2018-05-29 23:41:54 !!??  Long term investors are rolling in cash, with stocks at their highest!!?  What are you talking about?  Those that will get hurt are more recent investors who are not yet “long term” investors but want to become one day.  Bull is not dead, but it’s sputtering.

47 2018-05-29 23:40:20 I guess so.. can you demystify the correlation between bitcoin the leading indicator for stocks?
48 2018-05-29 23:40:14 Something fishy there. I doubt if the value of his Starlite & other business stocks went up 10x in just one year. Either he understated his 2016 SALN or the stock 'value' went up thru the roof simply after joining govt. 
49 2018-05-29 23:39:39 So instead of predicting just how horrific stocks would get, we focused instead on the CB policies that will likely be launched in response to the next crisis. These include, NIRP and Nuclear Levels of QE, Cash Bans on physical cash, and Wealth Taxes/ asset seizures.
50 2018-05-29 23:39:17 Are you taking a piss?? When you pay to back him... You’re paying to invest in a service and you should receive a return in the form of playing on time. If you invest in stocks, you want to earn when the market opens. Period. It’s insulting the backers who pay the entry.
51 2018-05-29 23:38:22 I wonder if Yoongi has invested i stocks tho
52 2018-05-29 23:37:59 You see this everywhere, whether it be Corporate Bonds, Housing, Stocks, derivatives, etc. All of them are mispriced based on a false risk profile because the "risk free" rate (sov. bond yields) is abnormally low.
53 2018-05-29 23:37:37 My nephew started out in Street Stocks at 13 and now drives a B Mod which he made himself (he's 30 now). A couple of years ago, in the same year, he won the Pro Stock Championship at Mt. Pleasant Speedway & Crystal Raceway here in Michigan.
54 2018-05-29 23:37:18 I’m assuming this got signed because some drug company paid a hefty sum to someone connected with one of you. After all, that’s the only reason Republicans get out of bed, it seems. Especially your administration. Why haven’t you banned bump stocks and raised the gun age limit?
55 2018-05-29 23:36:59 Statement read from @RepDavidEPrice at @nctownhall about gun control changes such as banning bump stocks, comprehensive background checks for buying guns & extreme risk protection orders being needed #nced #ncpol
56 2018-05-29 23:36:22 I doubt you know him. 
Also, why haven't you banned bump stocks and increased the age to purchase a firearm?!
57 2018-05-29 23:36:07 I say the stocks should go up!
58 2018-05-29 23:34:26 Statement from @NC_Governor read at @nctownhall saying that changes such as raising age to buy assault style guns to 21, extreme protective orders & banning bump stocks should be supported by #ncga. #nced #ncpol
59 2018-05-29 23:34:14 Yoooo!!! You dey fuck with penny stocks?! Timothy Sykes worry me saa. I give up cos of the fees. I go link make we talk.
60 2018-05-29 23:34:07 Italy's fate is undecided. Italian bonds are going bust, and the negativity has spilled over into stocks as well.
61 2018-05-29 23:33:30 32 million people watched Roseanne on opening night, stocks for Disney were down after the cancellation. Hmm yes, yes I think people will be missed. They better try to get the middle or blackish back quick
62 2018-05-29 23:33:10 Stocks were down about 450 points this am soon after opening. I’m all for boycotting their sponsors & being SURE they know why, but it may not be down bc of our boycott yet. Took 2 seasons for NFL to get msg. ? Don’t forget Disney is 1 of the 6 Globalist Media Giant Owners
63 2018-05-29 23:32:15 Higher graphite prices mean all the stocks in the sectoe go up regardless of how long to production
64 2018-05-29 23:32:14 Ban Bump Stocks!
65 2018-05-29 23:31:45 The Disney stock has been underperforming for years. Hopefully not too many people spent their kids’ money on that. Like you said, for other stocks, if you like Disney, go to Disneyland (buy the product), not the stock.

69 2018-05-29 23:29:11 Worded it better? Is there a polite way to word what she tweeted, what she's been tweeting & saying for some time? 1A entitles her to speak her mind, & Disney's stocks plummeting, coworkers walking & show canceled is simply Americans exercising their rights.
70 2018-05-29 23:27:01 I’m getting way to addicted to stocks again

80 2018-05-29 23:22:29 tell the whole truth all major media stocks were down and this happened before cancellation was announced don't tell half truths that's the same as lying
81 2018-05-29 23:22:22 The great push to destroy, destroy, destroy. Are we back in the Dark Ages?
Get out your armor guys, your shields, sharpen your swords, knives, spikes and whatever else you can use as weapons. Time to build castles motes and stocks.

85 2018-05-29 23:20:42 One ocean scientist out here says present tanker traffic is a reason for shaky chinook stocks. Chinook are the Southern Killer Whale main food source. He says more tankers 'will' collapse chinook stocks and the Southerrn Killer Whale will be extinct.
86 2018-05-29 23:20:32 This is the one rare moment where I'm happy to stand aside and let their blind, stupidly-placed fury run rampant. Maybe we can convince them that Trump was a secret liberal and he intends to actually follow through with banning bump stocks?
87 2018-05-29 23:20:29 Although MB has least weightage among 26 companies  in Multicap 35 fund but it is surely a  reason to worry but we have full trust on you and Gautam. Just suggestion, why can’t we add few stocks from Non- Financial sectors 2 diversify this fund as v still have room for 9 funds
88 2018-05-29 23:20:21 My theory about trump trying to take us back to 1950s is correct. The stock market is at its all time low since 1948, talk about a blast from the past huh? #stocks #stockmarket #thankstrump #goldendayloser
89 2018-05-29 23:20:15 I don't have any kit with mine, not even sure of the legality of the stocks if they are new manufacture
90 2018-05-29 23:19:23 Yes ban bump stocks and assault weapons before the sun goes down today!
91 2018-05-29 23:18:40 Interesting one Ron. You would think Amul smp sales would increase on GDT stocks were growing too much there?
92 2018-05-29 23:16:28 Most business is global and most stocks for those businesses are available worldwide....it’s a shame our White House, despite having hotels in many countries as we’ve all been reading about recently, doesn’t think globally!
93 2018-05-29 23:15:43 Hello genius - Dow was down almost 400 points today! Most stocks were down. NICE TRY!! You are a business journalist? Huh! Are you really? Disney probably will gain lot more goodwill from good sensed people for doing what they did today!!
94 2018-05-29 23:15:29 I love economics so I'm learning it uses stocks.
95 2018-05-29 23:15:02 Ya with Italian banks and others nearing the boiling point, Quadrillion a in derivatives ready to implode it's bound to be a crypto summer, I am glad to see the stocks sinking today and cryptos in the green today...that's how it's supposed to work
96 2018-05-29 23:14:29 why don't people invest in gasoline like they do with stocks. buy when it's cheap and sell later on
97 2018-05-29 23:14:00 Never ceases to amaze me how they've yet to learn their lessons. Leave the islands and dinosaurs alone and go invest in stocks and bonds do lol
98 2018-05-29 23:13:10 Bh worth 1 trillion, lowkey wish BTS had already bought some stocks of the company.
99 2018-05-29 23:13:00 Ban bump stocks!!
100 2018-05-29 23:12:51 @RozenChild?
101 2018-05-29 23:07:50 Ban bump stocks
102 2018-05-29 23:07:46 I read a theory where it was 6 billionaire stock owners on that plane and this major company paid the pilot to crash the plane to kill the those 6 people (alongside the other 200+) and immediately after that said company bought the stocks they wanted.
103 2018-05-29 23:07:38 @realDonaldTrump is no leader and failure as a human being, and BTW ”Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?”   #DonTheCon
104 2018-05-29 23:06:36 They didn't buy stocks, they didn't have any share in BH.
105 2018-05-29 23:06:04 Excuse me. You promised to outlaw bump stocks and sales of guns to people under 21. You haven't done that. Are you scared of the NRA?  My dad would have called you a candy ass. @davidhogg111
106 2018-05-29 23:06:00 Yes, the event is over but you can still get the coffee sleeves when you buy a drink at pluseighttwo, while stocks lasts!

108 2018-05-29 23:04:27 Hey @ThomasLegendK, im assuming to find stocks you just look at % gainers and stuff in chat that fits your patterns?
109 2018-05-29 23:02:33 All tech stocks were down today. ABC will get a boost from this racists cancellation!
110 2018-05-29 23:01:53 So all the media stocks went down because of Roseanne, even though none of them, except Disney, has anything to do with Roseanne? That makes no sense whatsoever.
111 2018-05-29 23:01:53 Conservatives have proven that we have power. Disney stocks have dropped, ABC has ruined its brand over false allegations of racism, when the context was violence. The wise see that, Rosanne knows the value of free speech and so does her audience. It's past time to call these
112 2018-05-29 23:01:34 how do u buy stocks lemme buy some from bighit i gotta get my coin back

115 2018-05-29 23:00:51 Do you take more of an active or passive role in your investments? #401(k) #stocks?
116 2018-05-29 23:00:18 Active managers don’t recognise the crash quickly enough so don’t sell out of falling stocks quickly enough and then hesitate at the bottom and don’t buy back in quickly enough either
117 2018-05-29 22:58:18 I don't personally care, why @Disney's stocks are down. #WaltDisney
would be rolling over in his grave, if he knew what his legacy has become.
118 2018-05-29 22:57:28 Ban bump stocks and make your votes count in midterms! Our children need us to stand up!
119 2018-05-29 22:57:22 Ban bump stocks!
120 2018-05-29 22:57:16 I should invest and buy some stocks on bighit wtf they're worth a trillion won now.
121 2018-05-29 22:57:02 Oh speaking of stocks, I'll be back to tweet about them soon. No positions for awhile as I'm building up the war chest(s), so to speak.
122 2018-05-29 22:56:40 Best feeling in the world is when you making money and the stocks are down but yours are still up and floating @rss11j #whosaidwetakelosses
123 2018-05-29 22:55:52 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
124 2018-05-29 22:54:31 European stocks fell sharply led by a 2.7% fall in the Italian bourse as they look likely to head to new elections. The stability of the Eurozone and the potential for it to wobble or collapse is seen as a possibility. Italian 10 year debt yields surged o/nite.
125 2018-05-29 22:54:21 You didn't outlaw bump stocks or keep people under 21 from getting guns like you said you would. Afraid of the NRA, I'll bet.  @davidhogg111
126 2018-05-29 22:54:02 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
127 2018-05-29 22:53:24 You're actively *lying* at this point. Stocks dropped *B-E-F-O-R-E* the cancellation.
128 2018-05-29 22:53:24 Agree that whether you borrow the capital is irrelevant. Just pointing out that housing is actually a bad income investment (lots of stocks/bonds pay more yearly) so you need to  discourage landlords from pulling supply.
129 2018-05-29 22:52:45 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
130 2018-05-29 22:52:30 Bullshit. All similar stocks were down.
131 2018-05-29 22:52:21 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
132 2018-05-29 22:52:20 Whoa, shout out to ME for getting a convo going I guess lol. I tweet about stocks, Japanese music, I'm pretty much a well-rounded dude. But dare lob a criticism about traditional exclusivity and people be shooketh! The kids use shooketh nowadays right?!
133 2018-05-29 22:52:20 sorry for the really basic question, but interested in placing an options contract on a number of property stocks (UK). Can someone recommend a suitable platform that allows for this? Never done this before 
e.g. a 12 month put option on Savills (expires May 2019)
134 2018-05-29 22:52:18 Disney probably stocks the corporate bathrooms with $100 bills instead of toilet paper. But Clickbait gotta Clickbait.
135 2018-05-29 22:52:15 Ban bump stocks!!
136 2018-05-29 22:52:14 Let’s rid of bump stocks & save innocent lives.
137 2018-05-29 22:52:00 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?

140 2018-05-29 22:51:38 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
141 2018-05-29 22:50:46 Very clear ABC, bring Roseanne back or cancel all these very racist shows or lose your sponsors & watch your stocks drop.  No double Standards.

145 2018-05-29 22:47:07 Any tweet about stocks being down after some event are bogus. Rihanna saying she’s bailing on instagram, et al it’s just pure speculation and bad reporting
146 2018-05-29 22:46:32 WHY do I stand to make about $50 million?  Because lying women said I was "unemployable" rather than admitting to stealing secretarial work, which put me on SSDI, supported me with YOUR tax dollars, and gave me all day to write films and develop ways of picking stocks.  #incels
147 2018-05-29 22:46:23 People did die in the Vegas shooting. But saying that bump stocks should be banned is saying that you would rather want people to perform mass murders in a long amount of time. How about having it so it wouldn't matter if there was a bump stock or not.

156 2018-05-29 22:41:49 Wrong again.  $DIS bottomed at noon, before the "Roseanne" cancellation. Announcement didn't spark a further drop. Other media stocks also down.
157 2018-05-29 22:41:43 Ban bump stocks for the love of g-d!
158 2018-05-29 22:40:57 #fin2209 @ProfLowell While reading about Beta Coefficients in Chapter 11, I stopped to take a look at Disney (1.18) and Fox (1.21). Both stocks are considered risky investments. Perhaps this is linked to DIS's near $4 price drop in the last two weeks.

163 2018-05-29 22:40:15 I don’t like him and I live in another country, so what am I to do? Every time he says or does something stupid it affects me directly. My stocks have plummeted and gas went up to 1.60/litre because of him destroying the Iran deal.
164 2018-05-29 22:39:55 I loved the stocks in fallout 4. I used them so I wouldn’t have to look around for my companions they would stay in the same place. Soooooo convenient
165 2018-05-29 22:39:46 How Far Can Stocks Fall?
 
This “time is not different,” and there will be few investors that truly have the fortitude to “ride out” the next decline. Everyone eventually sells. The only difference is “selling when you want to,” versus “selling when you have to.”

168 2018-05-29 22:38:44 The news of the cancellation broke around 1:45p Eastern, well after stocks took drop.  A little hyperbolic, Reuters.
169 2018-05-29 22:38:43 @davidhogg111 ban bump stocks.
170 2018-05-29 22:38:26 @MyASICS @ASICSphilippine  i just want to know if you still have stocks for GEL Netburber Ballistic indigo-red. Pls pls respond. 
171 2018-05-29 22:37:54 Yes, but we've been in a multi-year bull market. None of those stocks have even retraced 20% let alone plunged 40%+. How many still in Disney? It's under performing as well the last few years.
172 2018-05-29 22:37:35 True but based on the fact that he's only allocated 2-3% in individual stocks as "play money," it seems he's highly focused on optimizing for time horizon. Good VCs are emotion-driven active managers with much longer time horizons than the avg public market investor

268 2018-05-29 21:54:29 Recently on the @ASX watch list: DMP LLC and IVC. Overnight falls on the @DowJones, should see these stocks pull back into better buy zones without destroying the underlying technicals which were the basis of adding them to the watch list in the first place.
269 2018-05-29 21:53:47 Ban bump stocks!!!!
270 2018-05-29 21:53:39 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
271 2018-05-29 21:53:25 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
272 2018-05-29 21:53:16 Three questions: what kind of porn is she watching and which grocery store stocks porn next to corn flakes? When did she last actually do her own shopping? #altgrocerystore #congressionalmilkandbreadrun

277 2018-05-29 21:49:10 I'm fully aware of what stocks do on a daily basis- it's my job. Stocks are down for 18 YTD, and since inaguration day, Obama has outperformed Trump in that category. Fact.

And stock performance does not correlate to avg employee income- HHI decoupled w stocks around 1980.
278 2018-05-29 21:48:59 Ban Bump Stocks NOW. This is a no brainer. #BanBumpStocks
279 2018-05-29 21:48:24 I thought that stocks overall were down because of a political crisis in Italy.  #Basta or is that...#Pasta?
280 2018-05-29 21:48:21 All stocks are down....
281 2018-05-29 21:47:59 Just sat through a 99 stock 20XX CPU teams match (pikachu samus vs ganon fox). It took like 2 and a half hours and resulted in ganon fox winning by 12 stocks.
282 2018-05-29 21:47:31 This is where we can make a difference. The globalists care more about money than they do their own children, so let’s hit them where it hurts!  Sell your stocks, flip by their network with your remote and bash the hell out of them on Twitter!
283 2018-05-29 21:47:24 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would ? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
284 2018-05-29 21:47:02 United States stocks sank Tuesday amid political turmoil in Italy that  sent the euro tumbling and ongoing difficult trade talks with China. The @DowJones industrial average fell 391.64 points — or 1.58%  — to finish  at 24,361.45....
285 2018-05-29 21:45:03 Financial stocks slump as interest rates tumble on global econ concerns. Banks have been counting on higher rates to boost profit.

286 2018-05-29 21:44:31 Soros is shorting stocks. Wants to bring market down to Make President Trump look bad. Invest in real estate. People like Soros and Rothschild control market. 
287 2018-05-29 21:44:30 Poor reporting to insinuate the show’s cancellation had anything to do with stock prices.  The stocks fell before the cancellation, and all media is down.
288 2018-05-29 21:44:29 The distinction is that unlike with stocks - which companies use to raise money - you need a house to live in

A house is both a financial asset and a necessary service. If you have a lot of wealth, housing is super cheap right now. If you're poor, it got very expensive very fast
289 2018-05-29 21:43:46 Finally got the money to buy a dress I’ve wanted for time and now NO SHOP STOCKS IT why why why why why why why why
290 2018-05-29 21:43:45 Are you going to continue to ignore the promises you made to the Parkland school shooting survivors to outlaw bump stocks, universal background checks, and raise the age limit to 21?
291 2018-05-29 21:43:37 There are only two crypto currency stocks that can be bought on Robinhood, that’s lame.

297 2018-05-29 21:40:54 This is interesting, I just starting with stocks/OTC Jan this year and when I read up about this company it looked somewhat promising but been calling it a LOTTO stock. LOL Thanks for the info I will read more into it and determine what to do. I been looking for more long term.
298 2018-05-29 21:39:47 Hey look we agree on something for once, Brian. Stocks got slammed today. So did Disney which I unfortunately own.
299 2018-05-29 21:39:14 Hey stock traders of the world, maybe you need to smoke a bowl once in a while, so you don’t freak out and sell off every time the wind changes directions. Why don’t you just give me your Stocks to hold? you obviously don’t know what to do with them.

305 2018-05-29 21:36:51 In an interview today, @JoshKaulWI, the only Democratic candidate for attorney general, said he would not support a ban on semiautomatic weapons. But he said he supports a universal background check system and a ban on bump stocks.

321 2018-05-29 21:29:57 A not-so-artful dodge, but so be it.  Silence might've been better.  Roseanne will likely be topping more headlines than ever long after @POTUS has moved away from "more important matters." @therealroseanne stocks are the only ones up. Should one worry? Ask an Italian today
322 2018-05-29 21:29:44 Recheck your timing. Stocks were down before canceling. Report accurately.
323 2018-05-29 21:29:41 Okay, MR. PRESIDENT. Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 as you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
324 2018-05-29 21:28:51 Most of the time it will bounce up & down. If I looked at my stocks every day I would panic! But a lot of the time, there is a loss for short term but if you keep it in there & don't panic you get a larger payout and gain. I mean I lost 15k in one night before because of a crash
325 2018-05-29 21:28:35 Only buy stocks that go up - problem solved!

332 2018-05-29 21:25:04 The type of ppl who think the show Roseanne represented them, likely don’t invest in individual stocks; and to the extent they do, Disney likely isn’t one of those stocks; and to the extent it is, they can’t move the Disney needle 2.5%.
333 2018-05-29 21:25:02 If you bought the stocks in the Nifty index, equal weighted, on May 26 2008, versus buying the Nifty itself, who would win today? Hint: There were Suzlon, RCOM and Unitech in the Nifty then, all of them down over 95% since.
334 2018-05-29 21:24:45 Ban Bump Stocks!
335 2018-05-29 21:23:29 Is it your contention that He pays himself a “Salary” that allowed him to obtain that wealth?  Let me ask you; is that $133B tied up in bank accounts or is it mainly based on stocks options from his company. Once again, Bernie is preaching to the ignorant.
336 2018-05-29 21:23:09 @realDonaldTrump We should all tweet ”Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?”
337 2018-05-29 21:22:55 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
338 2018-05-29 21:22:16 Stocks bump around on the way up. You don’t want them going straight up. That’s a bubble.
339 2018-05-29 21:21:37 Most stocks are down.... and a lot of them much more than DIS.  This is a misleading headline at best...
340 2018-05-29 21:21:35 w/Dwyer, Saut beating drum skies to clear soon for stocks, I'd expect IG soon to reverse paving the way....

342 2018-05-29 21:18:56 $SPY Unless you're trading the indexes themselves the overall markets had little to no effect whatsoever on many stocks today. Focus  :)
343 2018-05-29 21:18:34 I see that when stocks are up gold is down and when stocks are down gold is what’s up with that.
344 2018-05-29 21:18:04 maybe.  Have to see how it closes weekly whether above or below 270.  We're treating individual stocks with stops, not basing it on SPY
345 2018-05-29 21:16:46 The Italian Crisis is spreading. Stock markets world wide are falling as are Bank stocks while bond rates are rising. The greatest fear is that the IMF man who is the designated prime minister will not be able to govern and that new elections will boost the ‘populists’.
346 2018-05-29 21:16:41 0-0 ht was the perfect time for Tis to cut loose, Cov weren't doing much more then us. Jay was perfect to play off Stocks,  Kyle to play with pace up the left. He had the weapons.... he refused to use them.
347 2018-05-29 21:16:19 Sec 27 & 1:03 quite stablished UpB kill “all or nothing” I’ll say  (good you had 2 stocks, just to be on the safe side) question though! Is your main Link or Fox?
348 2018-05-29 21:15:56 Anyway, given gun culture in US and large no of existing weapons, gun ban not practical, but surely you would favour restrictions (background checks, end bump stocks etc)? This is what other countries with large gun ownership do and seems likely it could prevent some shootings.
349 2018-05-29 21:14:51 ‘Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?’ No ba...

351 2018-05-29 21:14:36 Bonds up and stocks down...feels like the old days.  Now I remember why owning some fixed-rate bonds makes sense even when I am convinced rates are going up!  #markets
352 2018-05-29 21:14:10 ‘Hilarious’ as in we all assume that only tech stocks do really well. At boarding school my son and his mates used to order in Domino’s mid afternoon after sports matches. To tide them over between lunch and dinner!
353 2018-05-29 21:14:06 Ol'Bob sez...Villi don't forget to Boycott Marvel movies, ABC, CNN(emotionally challenged April Ryan), ESPN(mentally insane Keith Olbermann), Disney Cruise line and most important of all Disney stocks!!!!

359 2018-05-29 21:10:53 I bet those 20 active funds have around 1000 stocks max, compared to 18-20k in LifeStrategy. Who gives a toss about yield? Total return what matters.
360 2018-05-29 21:10:31 $SCHW commercial that says sometimes the best thing to do is nothing in #stocks.  This is one of those times.
361 2018-05-29 21:09:34 And even if there were a connection, media stocks do go up and down, and cancelling Roseanne was the right thing to do.  You can't not do the right thing, just because stock might go down.
362 2018-05-29 21:08:56 True, it seems to be the case for most of the stocks on our local bourse especially since there is little shareholder activism.
363 2018-05-29 21:06:51 Why are you lying about the chain of events here? The stocks dropped after she tweeted, and rose after the show was cancelled.
364 2018-05-29 21:06:27 See what you did you condescending bastard. The stocks fell bad. Thank you Donald Trump
365 2018-05-29 21:06:23 Frere les Yeezy ca avait deja perdu de la valeur, la méthode des stocks limités ca a créé trop de fake, et puis deja petit a petit les stocks sont devenus plus élevés, donc moi ca mderange pas, ca va devenir les Jordan du 21eme siecle !!!
366 2018-05-29 21:06:10 So they took something true ($DIS stocks down) but merged it with something unrelated (the firing if Roseanne) and made it fit their narrative. Strange, that's what @CNN does all the time. But you stay up there on the moral high ground Brian.
367 2018-05-29 21:05:42 Their stocks bottomed out for the day before the cancellation news even came out.

370 2018-05-29 21:05:00 The U.S. financial sector led the market sharply lower Tuesday amid fears that Italy will try to exit the euro zone and leave the single currency. European banks stocks were crushed, and yields spiked on Italian bank debt. The S&P financial sector was down 3.4 percent.
371 2018-05-29 21:04:55 I'm not surprised why you hate @Julius_S_Malema so much, you must be really terrified because we're coming for our land and our grandfather's live stocks, you can have your mirrors back.

399 2018-05-29 21:00:03 Stocks will let them get more outside investments! So it will be good for them financially. In return though, depending on who buys the stocks, they may have to follow through with requests from shareholders who hold a lot of the stock they put up for listing
400 2018-05-29 20:58:44 Selling their stocks does NOTHING to them. 

BUYING MORE of their stock and raising Hell at the Stockholders' Meeting actually IS effective, because they HAVE to listen to you - you are a stockholder.

407 2018-05-29 20:51:43 Left to their own devices fishing companies routinely overfish and collapse stocks. In NZ today, MPI manage fisheries under the direction and control of the fishing companies. Hence the repeated collapses of stocks are unsurprising.

412 2018-05-29 20:49:36 @leia_klingel Today's Market Alert : Stocks plunge on Italy's political uncertainty : , 
GOOD !
413 2018-05-29 20:48:56 This is a bogus tweet. Major media stocks were all down today. $DIS bottomed out at noon, well before "Roseanne" was cancelled. And the announcement didn't cause a further decline in the stock price.
414 2018-05-29 20:48:55 u wanna know what's funny?
from tracking trades, I found that I am so bad at shorting penny stocks at the open and I thought that it was my best type of trade. It turned out, my best type of trade is shorting earnings losers.
415 2018-05-29 20:47:36 So how would a downfall of the DOW/Stocks and later the 'real' economy affect the crypto space? Fight or flight?
416 2018-05-29 20:46:39 Sir, any way to add a longer term list of great stocks sitting in longer bases and at key MA’s?  Not just for the next day?  I am keeping the past key listers in a spreadsheet as my go to list.  Thanks!  If not, no worries.  Working my own scans ( not successfully though!)
417 2018-05-29 20:45:58 I'd add there's an underlying assumption here that Trump base/Roseanne viewers are "mass selling" shares of $DIS. Fact: 84% of stocks are held by top 10% wealthiest Americans, & the rest who have something invested via a ret. plan are usually in mutual funds--not direct holdings.
418 2018-05-29 20:45:31 Hi there I’m liddle andy and I’m going to #scheerwantstobankruptcanadians if you buy weed stocks or mutual funds. And pension funds. I almost stopped the legalization of weed a month ago. Look at me go. I’m going to fuck you canadians over good. #dontvoteconservative

425 2018-05-29 20:42:43 Only 65 out of the 500 Corps that got tax cuts gave a bonus of temp raise. The rest took their $ and bought back stocks. Another Trickle down F**k job.
426 2018-05-29 20:41:56 Not really - some stocks are already 50% below their tops for the year :)

434 2018-05-29 20:38:16 The top five stocks that fell today were $BWA, $MS, $STT, $MET, and $PCG.
435 2018-05-29 20:38:14 Evening Market Wrap-Up: stocks tumble amid Italian political concerns. PEP closed higher breaking above $101 with room to $102.
436 2018-05-29 20:37:52 Why is this even a discussion. Bump stocks make no sense if we want safer communities.
437 2018-05-29 20:37:50 The narrative needs to change!
The NRA wants people to think that gun control means banning all guns or taking away everyone’s 2A rights.
Though most people want tougher legislation for accessibility to bump stocks etc, background check & stopping NRA lining politicians’ pockets!
438 2018-05-29 20:37:48 For some reason it’s more satisfying to have all your stocks deep in the green on a market bloodbath day. I hope that’s not evil...
439 2018-05-29 20:37:22 The top five stocks that gained today were $ALGN, $AMAT, $KSS, $EQIX, and $MU.
440 2018-05-29 20:37:13 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
441 2018-05-29 20:36:53 Ban bump stocks now, Trump promised this on national TV right after the Florida school shooting! Do it.
442 2018-05-29 20:36:42 The top five most active stocks today were $BAC, $GE, $MU, $AMD, and $C.

449 2018-05-29 20:35:27 By the end of the year, I wouldn't be surprised to see a lot of stocks falling 50% even from current levels. Large and small caps alike.

451 2018-05-29 20:34:19 As are ALL stocks today
452 2018-05-29 20:33:52 We should all tweet ”Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?” on every @realDonaldTrump tweet from now on. @davidhogg111
453 2018-05-29 20:33:52 The only opinions which really matter to success are the opinions of those who are or could potentially be funding you.

If one rents out housing, one really has no need to put money into anything other than the property itself. Trading stocks barely needs putting on shorts.
454 2018-05-29 20:33:24 Bum stocks are banned stop listening to a no nothing weasel also many states have raised age to 21 Wich is dum and will not change anything the most restricted states have the highest crime rates they say Alaska but that's suicide liberal states have the highest gun crime

485 2018-05-29 20:23:09 BS Tweet. Stocks were already down today. Shame on you
486 2018-05-29 20:22:40 World stocks tumble: US -1.6%; Europe -1.4%. Political uncertainty spread from Italy throughout Europe & compounded the same in US. Could be more than short-term & add to volatility.
487 2018-05-29 20:22:09 I agree. I own PEP, XOM and DIS of the ones you mentioned. Italian stocks will be on sale the coming weeks.

524 2018-05-29 20:11:36 I'm afraid if I say anything more you'll get really confused again and think that I'm trying to use legal jargon. I'll keep it very simple. THE - ENTIRE - MARKET - IS - DOWN. CBS, Time Warner, AMC, Viacom stocks are ALL down.
525 2018-05-29 20:10:54 Pundits on CNBC and Bloomberg are telling me US stocks are great place to be... Not talking about valuation. US stocks most expensive in the world.
526 2018-05-29 20:09:52 “Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?”
527 2018-05-29 20:09:40 The Criminal Bank Stocks....Beware

529 2018-05-29 20:09:06 Netflix, that there online shop and those dudes who stole our data are a (less dim) light on a dark day for stocks
530 2018-05-29 20:07:28 The stock market is not for ordinary humans I am afraid. CDS ... derivatives, options and futures , MBS , ABS these are all mental stuff. Even ordinary stocks. What are we really really buying? Nothing thin air. It is a sophisticated 419 scam. Really.
531 2018-05-29 20:06:05 sorry but spec stocks are not safe havens - as a holder of WFE I am going to say this is a ramp.
532 2018-05-29 20:05:38 I'm still on T or S. Haven't heard them. I have some oil and gas stocks in managed accounts. Also have GUSH spread but entry timing was bad. Biding time till opportunity for my favorite strategy resurfaces
533 2018-05-29 20:05:05 Ban bump stocks!
534 2018-05-29 20:04:52 Stocks tumble with concerns about Italian economic & political tension. The Dow closed at 24,361.45, down 391.64 (-1.58%). Nasdaq -0.50%. S&P -1.16%.
535 2018-05-29 20:04:42 Stocks for the Long Run...
536 2018-05-29 20:04:00 Diversifying geographically can make a lot o sense. My home-market is Switzerland resp central Europe, I also hold some US stocks (KO, PEP, XOM, CVX, DIS, SJM). DIS, KO e.g. are kind of unique companies in my view.
537 2018-05-29 20:03:02 I hope Ann's stocks plunge in the dirt for canceling Roseanne.  I was excited about the show coming back and they cancel her for saying WAY LESS than many of their other flunkies have said and done and do them nothing?

543 2018-05-29 20:00:54 "Stocks end low but off their session lows".

Make up your own minds.
544 2018-05-29 20:00:50 How management communicates mistakes is very important. No one is mistake-free - as investors 40% of the stocks we buy underperform the market - and I'd be concerned about any company where shareholder communication doesn't include a candid assessment of mistakes. -- Bill Nygren
545 2018-05-29 20:00:35 Bank stocks got killed today 
546 2018-05-29 20:00:06 I don't have the exact numbers. I've seen studies where it's under 3 years for mutual funds and under 2 years for stocks. But with "free" trades being the norm, it's probably gone even lower. Before eTrade and the Internet, it was 8 years. But it cost you like $100 to sell.
547 2018-05-29 20:00:04 Ian seems surprised that The Doctor doesn't stock mercury.

"All 30 Dow stocks fall premarket, led by 1.6% drop in Walt Disney's stock ... Netflix is now bigger than Disney by this one measure."  Markets being markets, Joey.  You must be thrilled that Netflix is now Number One.  
550 2018-05-29 19:59:51 As the #'s are now showing, this corporate bond bubble is starting to burst, &  will ultimately hit junk bonds the worst… then stocks and real estate!

572 2018-05-29 19:51:02 Well since he does not have that power in a democratic republic, that would be a poor question.  Nobody cares about bump stocks, it's the language of the actual proposals that is at issue. And a 21 year old is a citizen too.
573 2018-05-29 19:50:42 Help save children’s lives ban bump stocks
574 2018-05-29 19:50:34 Roseanne canned, Italy veers right, stocks take a dump, Elon Musk courts the dark side…have we found those 1400 children?
575 2018-05-29 19:50:25 CALPERS lost probably close to $1 billion with this current rally for  they sold stocks thinking they picked the high based upon politics. The  pension liabilities are probably 10 times what the state claims.

577 2018-05-29 19:49:13 Bill Clinton signed the Brady Bill and a ban on assault rifles and we didn't have the mess we have today....so yes banning bump stocks and assault rifles Will work and its been proven
578 2018-05-29 19:48:34 Super confused market:
1. SPX/RUT/NDX moving averages too close to the price = choppy
2. Bonds recovering with good seasonality ahead = more buy-the-dip
3. US/ex-US stock tape just turned -ve

Stocks are likely to dip-and-rip a few more times in the coming days. $SPX $VIX $SPY
579 2018-05-29 19:48:30 Today was a coincidence. There's been much stronger down days for stocks this year in which crypto was also down (massacred in fact) e.g. Feb/2 and Feb/5. You are turning your own bias into a narrative.
580 2018-05-29 19:47:38 What will you do about anyone who wants bump stocks, REAL military weapons of war, avoidance of background checks or waiting periods at gun shows, & mental health care for insecure white angry men? #OrangeGeneration #EnoughIsEnough #NRAIsATerroristOrganization #VoteBlue2018

595 2018-05-29 19:39:11 I bought AMZ after Trump talked it down.  It's up 16% since.

The economy & stocks often do well when folks are confident that the govt is in good hands, and won't act to screw things up.  Clinton & Obama both produced that reaction over many years.  Not Trump or other Rs though.
596 2018-05-29 19:39:05 Having had the misfortune of having to listen to Radio 1 all day (all fucking day!!) I would back any decade (50’s onwards) to be better than anything produced these days. I feel very old this evening but grateful for what I got to grow up listening to

601 2018-05-29 19:37:24 Same thing happened as the market unraveled in 2000...big-cap tech stocks the last to roll over. More concentration in fewer names near the end.

Duh, bump stocks are not an accurate way to fire! In Vegas,if the shooter was a true sharpshooter using controlled aimed fire he could have doubled the casualties. Uninformed retoric is useless information!
646 2018-05-29 19:19:32 Agreed. It should be pulled immediately and those who created it put in public stocks so people can throw tomatoes at them.
647 2018-05-29 19:19:19 Don't play the penny stocks.

649 2018-05-29 19:18:04 Also worth noting that Tesla is one of the most shorted stocks on the market.

So tell me, when did trickle down economics fail? I'm pretty sure the great depression had to do with how people were leveraging their stocks. 2007 had to do with sub prime. Not tax policy.
872 2018-05-29 18:05:24 You won’t stop at bump stocks. While I think the world can survive without them, I am for the 2nd amendment. So... maybe if you were a little more reasonable, you’d get support of sane people on realistic issues. But of course that’s not your agenda.

916 2018-05-29 17:46:58 I find it ironic that as you spout off on what a bad POTUS Trump is, the Country has the best economy it’s had in 12 years, stocks up, GDP growth over 3-4% every Q he’s been in office, 17 total hostages released, welfare down, unemployment down, 90% if Americans got a tax break.
917 2018-05-29 17:46:11 @keremoner $LC is no value. Value stocks previously produced bottom line. LC has no history its model works to produce a profit.
918 2018-05-29 17:45:19 Most of brokers recommend stocks after they bought them and once the recommendation is out, they will look to sell it.

924 2018-05-29 17:42:52 Italy fears spur flight to quality in bond market, pushing 10-year US Treasury yield to 2.81% - down ~20 bps from last week. Bank stocks dive, with the KBW Bank index plunging ~4%
925 2018-05-29 17:42:39 Bump stocks make a weapon extremely inaccurate. A lot of people think a high cyclic rate makes a weapon more deadly. I disagree.

927 2018-05-29 17:42:37 Mr Heller You have done nothing about removing how the domestic terrorist that terrorized Las Vegas October 1 2017. You have done nothing about bump stocks. You done nothing about background checks. You done nothing about common sense gun laws. You need to have a town hall.

955 2018-05-29 17:38:07 @realDonaldTrump @larry_kudlow Martket DOWN 450 points- NOT GOOD FOR VOTES! U.S. stocks tumbled the most in a month, joining a global equity selloff sparked by concern Italy’s political woes will destabilize Europe. Treasuries surged, oil plunged and the yen rallied.

960 2018-05-29 17:35:53 Yeah, Tech loves low rates. However, they are still stocks & violent market moves down can take them down too. So, have to use stops & such.

970 2018-05-29 17:31:26 Geared for Music. Pushed today as a Buy - 71 times fwd earnings when will the market believed Altitude’s ‘19 f/c’s?? higher gross margin and recurring revenues so should be higher! Growth stocks all about confidence in fwd estimate ....why pay 71 when ALT is on 10!
971 2018-05-29 17:30:26 Dear me what is going  all my stocks are red

Except $NFLX and $SQ
972 2018-05-29 17:30:15 I really hate the new/updated @Google Finance page. It's worthless and not user friendly. I need to find a different site to easily track stocks & financial news.

978 2018-05-29 17:28:50 Is this one of those top 50 shorted stocks? Looks like it's been using the 200 day MA as support for awhile now.
979 2018-05-29 17:27:20 Not really.... If you have ever fired at full auto or burst you would know its extremely inaccurate. A bump stock makes it that much more crazy as you lose quite a bit of control at the shoulder. Ive never been a fan of bump stocks personally.
980 2018-05-29 17:27:12 U.S stocks stumbled over Italian crisis 
981 2018-05-29 17:27:03 If only the market paid 71 times prospective earnings for Altitude.....higher gross margin and recurring revenues so should be higher! Growth stocks all about confidence in that....will Altitude inflect ...my bet is YES......
982 2018-05-29 17:26:59 Is Trump purposefully flip flopping on China policy so he and his business can buy and sell stocks based on the market oscillations he is causing?
983 2018-05-29 17:26:41 @oddbalstocks - guessing retweet is not endorsement? This statement of house price going higher, so recession not possible seems pure speculation.
I "don't know"  what's going to happen, but almost all assets (house, PE, stocks) look elevated, i.e. more chance of a drop
984 2018-05-29 17:25:37 No. This is a very poor take. Over the past 48hrs she has used her mega phone to boost a neo Nazi, racially denigrate a former public servant and defame a holocaust survivor. Putting her in the Twitter stocks is apposite.
985 2018-05-29 17:25:08 If SPX closes below LOD, I expect all the above mentioned stocks to get hit as well.
986 2018-05-29 17:24:47 Very few ppl were bullish on gold. Just the bugs like usual. It was not cyclically overbought. It just pulled itself out of the gutter in 2008. It crashed down to $680. Gold stocks were just barely recovering from 08. $1900 was not even close to a bubble top
987 2018-05-29 17:24:19 my jobs to troll and short sucky stocks.
988 2018-05-29 17:24:08 Ban bump stocks for real

990 2018-05-29 17:23:30 The fact that $AMZN $NFLX,  $FB and $TSLA are all green - three of the biggest Ponzi stocks in the world - on a day when the Dow is down over 400 pts is emblematic of the fraudulent nature of the stock market
991 2018-05-29 17:23:00 Sir, It may reach at the quickest possible time, may be, but since stocks tend to move in zig zag manner and it would not be prudent to forecast a time frame at this juncture.
992 2018-05-29 17:22:56 Yeah it's seems like I'm too late to that party, but I'm also kinda confused on how it actually works so I think I may stick to stocks
993 2018-05-29 17:21:47 Mid-Day: Stocks continue slide (DOW -400+), while MBS benefits the "flight to safety", as reaches +42bps.  Yields have dropped further, which it's now sitting at 2.81% (breaking thru it's 100 DMA).
994 2018-05-29 17:21:19 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
995 2018-05-29 17:21:10 Is THAT the reason Italian stocks are crashing today? 
996 2018-05-29 17:21:04 Please ban bump stocks, there is no reason for these to exist.
997 2018-05-29 17:20:47 Great comment by @kevinmuir:

"...Here’s something to think about - what if the next move in bonds is higher, but it is only a cyclical bull move in a new secular bond bear market?..."

I think that there's a lot of 'radical thinking' in respect w/ "where stocks/bonds" will go...
998 2018-05-29 17:20:37 And now they whine about the solution. They sure weren't complaining when they cashed in the GM stocks which were attained in the same way. Whiney hypocrites, specially the cpc and jason kenney. Bunch of dipsticks.
999 2018-05-29 17:19:14 Do u know any1 else in south Africa who's also trading penny stocks and is learning from timothy sykes ? Maybe we could create a group or something for learning purposes and help each other
1000 2018-05-29 17:18:48 Stocks losses accelerate. Dow down nearly 400 points.
1001 2018-05-29 17:18:39 If POTUS was a fascist he could unilaterally outlaw bump stocks.
Where's a fascist when ya need one?
1002 2018-05-29 17:18:38 As expected, Stocks open lower.

1008 2018-05-29 17:17:11 Sir, there seems to be a whole new world of stocks like these.. I wonder how many more are there..
1009 2018-05-29 17:17:04 U.S. stock indexes slumped on Tuesday led by bank stocks, as a deepening political crisis in Italy triggered a rush to safe-haven assets.
1010 2018-05-29 17:16:39 The bump stocks are out of production, wake up and stop wasting everyone's time, at least try to look legitimate, no wants a stale Muffin
1011 2018-05-29 17:16:35 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would?
1012 2018-05-29 17:15:32 You know what stocks you picking you just holding out this isn’t good for a good number of Americans.
1013 2018-05-29 17:15:21 Ban bump stocks.
1014 2018-05-29 17:15:10 Id agree. We had a nice morning pullback but not seeing the massive selling . US stocks should have a pretty good year led by tech (and even financials eventually) , don't let the noise & emotions control a sound investment portfolio.
1015 2018-05-29 17:15:03 Connect the tribe of "Levi"-- Leo/Lavan/Javan/Kahan(Eknath/Ya(dav)-Kahan Mahasay)-- remember what I talked previously on this!

1021 2018-05-29 17:12:02 Dont you love when your family texts you the market plummeting and stating it’s a bear market after one down day. At least wait for a multi day sell off, but we’re nowhere near a bear market. To me this is a great way to identify strong stocks. $SPY, $SPX.

1029 2018-05-29 17:09:16 Please add banning bump stocks and raising the legal age to purchase a firearm to 21 yrs - like you said you would.
1030 2018-05-29 17:09:04 If you want to buy $100,000 in stocks you need $100,000 and if you want to buy $100,000 in #realestate you only need $20,000 (20% down). #CRE #investing

1037 2018-05-29 17:06:18 How can news like this come out and we still sit at this price? I've seen stocks blow up based on WAYY less. Damnit lol
1038 2018-05-29 17:05:59 The down momentum today is mainly from financial stocks.  $JPM and $BAC reach 200MA today, key support for these stocks.  Breaking down could induce selloff into bear market territory.
1039 2018-05-29 17:05:44 So you don’t advocate buying FANG stocks as a hedge against this Italian debt crisis?
1040 2018-05-29 17:05:12 The @CIA must have some pretty damning stuff on @SNB_BNS_en members for them to throw away their country and currency to the dustbin by "buying" the utter trash that are US Stocks.

1077 2018-05-29 16:53:50 This was already done in several states. In fact, bump stocks are banned in New Jersey since January and police has asked citizens to either destroy them or hand them in until mid April. They have not received a single one..

1108 2018-05-29 16:46:21 Broken analogy. So is the ledger at your broker/dealer a security? NO. Because it’s just where the ownership of your stocks is kept. BitcoinCash is the ledger where the security ownerships are recorded. BCH the money is just how you pay the cost for using the ledger.
1109 2018-05-29 16:45:31 It's to go public. So right now they're a private company and people can't buy stocks in them. But if they go public they'll have that ability

1181 2018-05-29 16:27:37 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
1182 2018-05-29 16:27:21 Also will be scanning Goldman's top 50 list of the most shorted stocks, for short ideas.
1183 2018-05-29 16:26:46 Yes please ban bump stocks
1184 2018-05-29 16:26:43 Ban bump stocks!
1185 2018-05-29 16:26:24 Word: Ban bump stocks NOW!

1188 2018-05-29 16:26:03 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
1189 2018-05-29 16:25:53 Well, no semi-automatic weapons, or bump stocks, or other actual true weapons of war, to start....
1190 2018-05-29 16:25:46 For a little while longer the market will probably enjoy some support since corporations will use their tax cuts to buy back stocks. Only a fraction of this windfall will go towards investments in assets and people, the ingredients for sustainable growth.
1191 2018-05-29 16:25:28 Selloffs like today allow you to buy the best stocks at a cheaper price than what the world's best hedge fund managers paid! Compiling my list now!
1192 2018-05-29 16:25:20 Ay-lmao @EA you guys are trash and you should try initiating a micro transaction policy on your stocks to impress your shareholders
1193 2018-05-29 16:25:10 He picked his position to:
- be elevated
- set up a surveillance system
- be able to pile up an arsenal

He, in no way, could have done the same carnage from the ground.

He, in no way, could have killed/ inured that many people w/o 'assault style' rifles w/ bump stocks.
1194 2018-05-29 16:25:06 So, where are those regulations against bump stocks and background checks that you promised again?
1195 2018-05-29 16:25:03 Research is the key @davidhogg111 . Obama's administration I think around 2010 decided nothing is wrong with bump stocks. Not the NRA. Lol
1196 2018-05-29 16:24:46 They have buy on all private sector banks, most auto stocks also.!! If you have them then say goodbye to your night sleep

1200 2018-05-29 16:23:46 Notice how Ms Mason could give 2 shits about @realDonaldTrump bringing lawmakers together to discuss schools safety, signing the Stop School Violence Act, Strengthening background checks & banning bumps stocks Y'all

1203 2018-05-29 16:23:05 Instead of forcing your engery the past,  do something about the water in Flint Michigan, US Citizens in Puerto Rico, ban bump stocks/raise the gun purchase age. You said you would. Or do something about the Russians interfering with our democracy. You failed as POTUS

1206 2018-05-29 16:22:42 The genie lied. The benefits are going almost exclusively to the rich via massive stock repurchases. The richest 10% own 84% of stocks and a good chunk owned by foreigners. The tax cuts will do very little for the economy, spike debt, and probably spur cuts in needed services.

1215 2018-05-29 16:20:30 I know perfectly well the definition of AR & that assault-style rifles are specifically made to kill many quickly. Which is why we're advocating to ban them & bump stocks as they're used in mass school murders. Again, we're not asking 2 abolish 2nd A & over 80% of Americans agree
1216 2018-05-29 16:20:16 kass has screamed to short the S&P every week essentially since late 2009. You think thats thoughtful?? and P.S. he's super long bank stocks and getting destroyed
1217 2018-05-29 16:20:08 That means he sold out his stocks and probably owns a lot of mining stocks
1218 2018-05-29 16:19:59 IMHO BNN/Bloomberg has got to find better guests or ones prepared to talk about stocks and not be given a platform for their emotional anti-government rants. @BNN/Bloomberg @AndrewBellBNN

1222 2018-05-29 16:18:56 2 bubble waves from now when crypto is somewhere between $10Trillion and $50 Trillion and half the world is dumping stocks to ride crypto bubbles, remind me again how crypto won't lead to chaos.
1223 2018-05-29 16:18:43 Stocks bounce around. Normal. We are at peace with NK; the issue is whether it can be made lasting, and that is looking promising. And trade wars are investments. You don't look at just the cost. ISIS lost its caliphate. How does any of that look bad to you?

1319 2018-05-29 15:47:49 It's a bubble... P/E ratio or not. So many stocks are funded via the national banks, who print up money to buy into equities. The Swiss National Bank, one of Apple's largest shareholders, is a great example. Then we have millions of 401k accounts being auto-funded. Frightening.

1338 2018-05-29 15:42:00 the same reason obama didn’t ban bump stocks: the legal language is exceedingly difficult to work around. he literally told sessions to do it. it wasn’t done not out of negligence, but because of the legal verbiage. and i don’t like trump.

1432 2018-05-29 15:17:23 Right, U are never sorry. How about all the school shootings & raising the legal gun age to 21? Banning bump stocks & AR-15?

1446 2018-05-29 15:11:55 @davidhogg111 hey #camerahogg I oppose a ban on bump stocks and raising the age to buy to 21. Unless we raise the voting age back to 21 too.

1455 2018-05-29 15:09:02 My anecdotal evidence is that advisors tend to have much greater confidence making a lump sum investment into bonds, but are concerned about volatility in stocks.
1456 2018-05-29 15:08:23 Should have been clear: I didn’t mean that DCAing into bonds doesn’t happen.  I meant that when I get asked about LSI vs DCA, the cardinal concern tends to be stocks because of their short-term vol compared to bonds.
1457 2018-05-29 15:08:22 But, long term investing in low float stocks, you must have price alerts to take advantage of obvious pumps to re-invest lower later. It is irresponsible to not look at your low-float holdings regularly or at least have price alerts to let you know.
1458 2018-05-29 15:07:35 Every trading strategy has risk of ruin, unless risk management is robust..... Some are slow poison....like buying options at high IVs hoping for windfall or buying/selling naked futures or buying illiquid penny stocks or options writing...

1503 2018-05-29 14:55:13 I usually only long stocks on day 1 since that's typically when you can find an edge. But my long trades are not until after 12pm. I watch the market open, see how they run. After 12 if it's reclaiming VWAP and holding I look start in.
1504 2018-05-29 14:55:02 Brought some stocks yesterday & I’m watching them closely... 
1505 2018-05-29 14:53:54 Alternatively... if you don’t like stocks, would you usually prefer to hold cash or would you own bonds? Not saying it’s correct, but shifts required equity risk premium to be negative vs cash to be negative vs bonds with trend.

1512 2018-05-29 14:52:31 One revision to the analysis may change your conclusion. Does the equity risk premium need to be vs cash in down markets or can/should it be vs bonds in all markets? Hardly anyone invests 100% stocks, so vs 60/40 allows trend to O/W stocks when favorable or U/W when unfavorable.

1549 2018-05-29 14:46:26 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
1550 2018-05-29 14:45:49 Stricter background checks that are not left to the states alone, more concise wording so that loopholes that allow bump stocks are removed, raise the age to 21 like alcohol, require parents be consistently held legally liable for children who access their firearms...

1554 2018-05-29 14:44:32 Bump-stocks cost $350 per minute to operate, threatens the survival of the gun it is attached to, and is inherently inaccurate. A voter at 18 is allowed to drive a car, a greater responsibility than gun ownership, and, if responsible enough to pass a background check, a long gun.

1562 2018-05-29 14:42:29 Me too. The beauty of dividend investing as we practice is you only have to worry about your buy actions. Besides, my only focus is dividend income and not capital appreciation. As long as dividend raises are reasonable, I am sticking to my stocks.

1717 2018-05-29 14:05:41 Oh @davidhogg111 ... you are just a bit too ignorant. Banning bump stocks won’t accomplish anything. 
And raising the age to 21 won’t either.

1929 2018-05-29 13:14:26 It could very well get to 100-120...but only if US stocks rise as it does IMO.  If we get US equities (& oil) down w/rising USD (like today), the runway is likely far shorter than that.  At 150% of GDP, the US stock mkt now IS the economy for all intents & purposes.
1930 2018-05-29 13:14:20 Then they’ll wonder why their stocks go down in value after this fake “bias” BS...
1931 2018-05-29 13:14:19 Always great talking the #stockmarket and individual #stocks with @OJRenick @TDANetwork Today was the impact of #Italy and why US small caps are a safe haven plus previewing $COST earnings.
1932 2018-05-29 13:14:16 Lol not sure what’s hard to understand about the SEC halting reporting delinquent pink stocks... they are cleaning up the improper filers and sending them to the Grey sheets
1933 2018-05-29 13:13:57 It's funny how bump stocks have existed for years prior to Vegas and has only been used in ONE crime ever, but you want to ban them? Knives kill more than rifles every year. Don't hear you yelling about that.  It's also funny that you think you need bump stock to bump fire.
1934 2018-05-29 13:13:37 Come on, let's grow up. Neither the Fed nor other agencies have fixed the manipulation going in stocks/WS; what u makes u think they can sort out something as enigmatic as crypto

1942 2018-05-29 13:12:06 Remember after the Parkland shootings, Trump promised to raise the minimum age requirement to purchase a firearm from 18 to 21.  He also promised to ban bump-stocks. 

NEITHER HAS HAPPENED!

The NRA controls Trump!

TRUMP IS A WEAK, COWARDLY, OLD MAN!
1943 2018-05-29 13:12:06 @davidhogg111 you ignorant little shit, the Department of Justice has already proposed a rule to make bump stocks illegal, but there is a regulatory process that must be completed BY LAW before they can take effect.  Get your ass back in school and learn something!

2067 2018-05-29 12:38:01 I think you make some extremely valid points in this video and I’d tend to agree from a certain point of view. When I said about nukes yesterday, I simply meant that certain weaponry (ie some rifles, magazines, bump stocks) is excessive and thus shouldn’t be protected under 2A
2068 2018-05-29 12:37:50 Nuh uh. Not without the hashtag, #frugalest.I’ve been mostly lucky with stocks and even accurately predicted a merger. I also did hundreds of hours of research on that stock and I’m not willing to put in that kind of time anymore.

2089 2018-05-29 12:33:28 And you really think this will solve the mass shootings issue, do you?  Which do you think is more important - banning bump stocks or denuclearizing NK?  OUR President is multi-tasking as much as he can, but there's a limit to how much one person he can do.

2093 2018-05-29 12:30:40 I’m all for background checks, standard AR mags are 30 rounds. If 18 to 21 makes you happy fine, bump stocks are irrelevant, automatic weapons are already heavily regulated.  But admit it. It won’t stop until all guns are gone, right? Its about control. 2A prevents govt. tyranny

2116 2018-05-29 12:25:08 I would think this snap back steepening in prices on the curve should lead to higher stocks... With recent dovish Fed and now Italy headlines it makes more sense to see a shock in front of curve as opposed to back anyhow. ...I don’t know anything though, nobody does.

2118 2018-05-29 12:24:49 It's getting real again in financial markets. The U.S. is unleashing the levers of inequality on the whole world; rising interest rates, supply-side fiscal policy, war drum beating - driving up energy prices. Stocks go up. But that doesn't mean it's good.

2292 2018-05-29 11:33:17 Bump stocks are situational... you need space, technique, and you can't keep it pressed against your shoulder pocket - which makes accuracy take a hit.

2487 2018-05-29 10:31:07 Stocks rarely perform in the time frames we predict, & it’s why the market only works for investors having long-term focus. Performance is never linear, up and to the right, year after year. You sometimes have to hold a position for few years before it goes up 100% in 3 months.

2508 2018-05-29 10:22:21 Crude Oil has corrected sharply from its recent high of $80 to $75 now. This should lower the inflation expectations and give a fillip to the beaten down rate sensitive stocks in the near term.

2557 2018-05-29 09:56:43 You should actually try reading from various sources ... turn off Hannity and Trump, etc.  They lie to you.  Obama deported huge numbers.  He instituted DACA.

2558 2018-05-29 09:56:28 We can't apply the same economic metrics used for stocks in the #cryptocurrency market because the (albeit miniscule) relationships with interest rates, P/Es, moving averages, etc., don't apply. It's a top 10 market long game, with an eye on new entrants.

2694 2018-05-29 08:46:26 Stocks rarely perform in the time frames we predict, & it’s why the market only works for investors having long-term focus. Performance is never linear, up and to the right, year after year. You sometimes have to hold a position for few years before it goes up 100% in 3 months.

2741 2018-05-29 08:20:48 Thanks for replying. I m not sure about your frequency of recommendations. Like 10 in a month but any suggestions how to select those 5-6 stocks out of your recommendations. Can you provide more high potential share worth investing at cmp. Investing at high is risky now , seems.
2742 2018-05-29 08:19:41 When sentiments are bullish, a lot of stocks multiply and some turn out to be manipulated duds. Like that when sentiments are shaky a lot of stocks can fall on talks of an impending fraud, and not all turn out to be Frauds. #AceEquities

2753 2018-05-29 08:07:04 I would not be  so quick to believe that story. More plausible in my opinion, is that the consignment was sold by private treaty and the proceeds consumed by your usual suspects... Where is the evidence of destroyed stocks? Such action must be gazetted.

2912 2018-05-29 06:34:11 And yeah, let's get back to bump stocks. The notion that they convert a semiautomatic rifle into an automatic rifle is on the side of being mythical. All they really do is allow continuous fire, but NOT at the same RATE as a weapon with auto fire! They're SLOW!

2914 2018-05-29 06:32:18 As per my other response Tom, if the BOD didn't make poor decisions then we would have been much higher.  Hopefully we are on the right track. As with all AIM stocks,  recommend having at least 10 positions open as it's very unpredictable.

2927 2018-05-29 06:22:56 Alright, 300k for a house, 50 k for a car. Keep about 150k for bills, food, gas, etc etc. Then take the rest and invest it. If you need some more cash, sell some of your stocks and use that. By the time your kid turned 18, you could take a big chunk of those investments-

2933 2018-05-29 06:19:13 Bump stocks & guns that need to be banned weren’t even part of our founding father’s imagination. Go back to using muskets if you’re going to keep bringing it up.  As times & weapons have changed dramatically, the 2nd A needs to be amended. This in not unconstitutional

2956 2018-05-29 06:09:04 I agree with this sentiment. The market at times does really random things that you need to prepare for, especially if you're trading BTC pairs. A lot of penny stocks are like that too. It might have to do with the low volume of trades (compare to the market cap of forex, etc)

2969 2018-05-29 06:03:45 Not to remove them. Except war weapons/bump stocks bc you don’t need them to protect yourself. If the govt cared, they should’ve strengthen background checks when purchasing a gun, aided money to schools for mental health resources. It becomes a govt problem for their inaction

2971 2018-05-29 06:03:24 My take. 
Fed (as always) was behind the curve. Yellen could have started to hike at a double pace and the market would have absorbed the impact with economy still healthy and stocks BTFDers' perennial help.
But now it's too late.
2972 2018-05-29 06:03:00 Ban bump stocks

3026 2018-05-29 05:24:57 When the things move fine, we believe that it will keep on happening in future too. This illusion makes us buy the stocks at higher prices.

When the things start getting poor, we tend to believe that this is the end of the road. This makes us panic and we start selling.

3030 2018-05-29 05:21:41 Fair but I also feel it's easy to take advantage of QA as well and Rosa can manage pretty well with it. Pivot grabbing or even jab can take care of it.  Also I don't think Pika can seal stocks that early against Rosa. Usually Pika has to rely on a harsh commitment iirc.

3034 2018-05-29 05:18:47 If Rosa's up b wasn't so easy to edgeguard, I might agree with you. As it stands, Pika does a really good job at keeping Rosa in disadvantage, taking out Luma, and sealing stocks early due to her light weight.

3062 2018-05-29 05:04:13 You might have a point but it's ok with you that Trump pays no taxes and his 1% rich friends, and himself, are enriching themselves by buying records amount of their own stocks.

3065 2018-05-29 05:02:51 The words out of Trump’s mouth were “You don’t have to worry about bump stocks. I’m going to take care of those with an executive order.” In which case - yes, the President would be in charge of writing that.

3070 2018-05-29 04:59:10 Good. Every state should follow suit since Supreme Court has declined to hear appeals of laws in 4 Circuits. There's no legitimate civilian need for firearms like that, high capacity magazines, bump stocks and slide fire devices.

I don't follow you dummy, but @davidhogg111 whom I do follow said I should ask why you didn't ban bump stocks and do any of the things you promised for #GunControl? You're afraid of #NoAR $$$?

3083 2018-05-29 04:49:37 Perhaps a better tactic would be to delve into the CA GOP candidate’s stance on gun safety or NRA contributions.  I doubt there’s one GOP candidate running on bump stocks, background checks etc

3103 2018-05-29 04:40:35 Since this would imply banning bump stocks, since they’re considered a part of common sense gun control, it didn’t really take long at all.

3118 2018-05-29 04:32:17 This is not true. I belong to "Armed & Literate". Dems support 2A and a "well regulated militia".

3142 2018-05-29 04:22:44 I couldn't disagree more. Poker by contract guarantees at least 88% failure with zero return,  not even partial return. No investment comes close. Not stocks, bonds, real estate or even crypto. Focus on top-heavy prize pools before worrying about this. JMHO

3179 2018-05-29 04:03:48 Btw, just as you, he said “why hasn’t Trump banned bump stocks”? Well it’s because it takes time. So by his admission he must not know. Simple analysis of the details at hand prove that.

3192 2018-05-29 04:01:06 Bump stocks are not protected by the 2nd Amend. Unless you serve in a "well regulated militia" you cannot own a weapon of war or any derivative thereof (an AR-15 with a bump stock for example)

3199 2018-05-29 03:59:54 He DID ban bump stocks and many states raised the age! I think raising the age is BS!That 17 yr old shooter did not have the gun legally! Killers ignore laws!18 yr olds serve in the military/they come home & can’t own a gun?All 18 yr olds are not crazies & we Have laws for that!

3202 2018-05-29 03:58:34 Maybe because you hung up on the White House...also raising the age to purchase would hinder me from being able to protect myself at the age of 18. Banning bump stocks is fine (idk if it would do anything though)

3207 2018-05-29 03:55:57 We should ask Trump every day to follow tradition, and transparency, and show his taxes. He flips on policy all the time. May never ban bump-stocks, unfortunately. But we, as voters and citizens, should see his tax returns. Who knows? He may be invested in bump-stocks.

3214 2018-05-29 03:52:57 Then how come you act like nothing has been done. Have you read the bill? Hogg surely hasn’t. Do you know it covers far more than bump stocks? I’m being civil. To inform you of the truth. This bill has been in effect since Jan. It takes time.
3215 2018-05-29 03:52:32 Stocks went up on private prisons as soon as Trump won because they knew this was going to happen. Everyone in rolled up in plastic is money rolls for investors

3218 2018-05-29 03:51:12 Actually he did, Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump announced on Friday that his administration will issue a new rule banning bump fire stocks, a gun accessory that makes it easier to fire rounds quickly from a semi-automatic weapon, mimicking automatic fire.

3220 2018-05-29 03:49:41 Beyond his constitutional authority? Um, last time I checked YOUR constitution, banning bump stocks doesn’t violate the 2nd Amendment in way, shape or form. For a start, it’s not even a firearm. #NRA much?
3221 2018-05-29 03:48:51 Where as Republicans did nothing to outlaw bunp stocks I voted any democrat that did not receive NRA funds!

3236 2018-05-29 03:42:54 Ok back to stocks
3237 2018-05-29 03:42:52 You know bump stocks are on the last 30 days of public discussion right? After that time they are banned. It’s been in this phase for the past 60 days (as is law). You act like he can just snap his fingers. It takes time to get things done. He set this in motion two months ago.
3238 2018-05-29 03:42:49 I did this. Great idea! I did it on his last 3 tweets. Will do on several more over the next could of days. 
Why didn’t @realDonaldTrump ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when @realDonaldTrump said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
3239 2018-05-29 03:42:21 Yeah, that’s just crazy. Market cap can get incredibly screwy though, because investors are willing to pay huge premiums for tech stocks. Based on revenue, Disney makes five times what Netflix does.

- Check where banking stocks are trading on daily chart, near resistance or support
- Check for the news events. Avoid trading on major event days, like RBI, Budget day, Election result, etc
- Check hourly pivots, where they are, if you see

3271 2018-05-29 03:29:26 Never listen to the stock market reports at 2:00 am; trade off stocks for a "safe" annuity" because stocks are plummeting.  Did that in the first term of the Obama administration.  Lost $30,000.  Had to delay my retirement due to that stupidity.  Trump's quote is spot on.

3352 2018-05-29 02:55:17 How many times have bump-stocks been used in a criminal act?  If we move to ban something every time it’s used to do harm, we’d have nothing.  Your anger is misplaced and illogical.

3355 2018-05-29 02:52:30 A president must work within a framework. He's not a dictator who can make decrees. Obama tried that, and it didn't work out well.

...oh, and bump stocks and ages are red herring, but that's another issue.
3356 2018-05-29 02:51:00 Bump stocks will change nothing u idiots. Like banning fast draw holsters or something equally stupid and useless. Go after the actual problem if you want to make a difference. The sick people created by your current society, values & failed laws. A nanny state is not the answer.

3369 2018-05-29 02:47:24 It is evil, not guns killing. I do agree with the bup stocks and the age, and a psychological test too. But you must know, if you removed all guns this would continue with other methods.

3375 2018-05-29 02:45:50 Denver had a buy back for all "bump stocks" do you know how many were sold back? Just 1, so you saying the majority want it done is plain old false
3376 2018-05-29 02:45:41 Sure if you are just starting out and you might have 3 or 4 stocks in your portfolio but if that is the case I would do mutual funds. I think it is a huge risk to have any one stock to be such a large portion a portfolio.

3379 2018-05-29 02:44:39 Here's my point. (Bump stocks) are still legal. Most are crap, but I digress. NOTHING,  beats aiming, co,trol, breathing. Being able to waste ammo, at speed, is not the Marine way. So..... I agree with the nra, do whatever

3492 2018-05-29 02:16:16 Shouldn’t have to clarify this but obviously I’m using hyperbole. I think my point still stands; high capacity magazines and bump stocks are not remotely necessary for self defence, just like a nuclear weapon, and thus should not be protected under the second amendment.

3515 2018-05-29 02:07:52 Bump stocks weren't even part of the initial argument, you deflected from my facts on the difference between a civilian AR and a military AR and the fact that guy is peddling lies when he says weapons of war are in the hands of average civilians

3558 2018-05-29 01:54:18 The key to unlocking wealth in the stock market is changing your mindset to stop renting stocks and start owning businesses. Focusing on the long-term is hard because it is counter to our human nature that craves action and immediate gratification.

3581 2018-05-29 01:49:22 Submitted my comments. If Congress won’t do anything about bump stocks then our voices must come together to speak up and vote them out. Win or lose we will continue the fight until real change happens. We’ll take a quick breather then keep fighting.

unlike him, I AM willing to hear all sides.  I just fail to see how banning bump stocks and raising gun purchase age to 21 stops our kids from getting shot at school. 

In my opinion, he should use his voice to push school safety.

3763 2018-05-29 01:08:40 I know you trade cryptos like stocks but do they behave the same? Stocks operate essentially the same regardless of stock price. Cryptos operational efficiency is dependant on their price and age. So if a cryptos price drops too low and is old enough then death spiral.

3845 2018-05-29 00:44:21 It is not realistic for her to have 12% return, other types of investments would be a safer, such as in stocks or using smaller accounts that would have more consistent returns

3857 2018-05-29 00:41:40 Trump said he would push for regulations to ban bump stocks and raise the legal age to purchase firearms to 21. After he met with the NRA, suddenly he's not pushing for these regulations. He lied.

3906 2018-05-29 00:32:06 Reality check: the police found that shitlog because his rate of fire set off his room’s smoke detector. Bump stocks drastically reduce accuracy (esp. because of muzzle climb).

The fact is bump stocks *saved* lives in Las Vegas.

3931 2018-05-29 00:26:11 Bump stocks make a no difference in fire arm deaths.

Raising the age also would not make a difference in fire arm deaths. 

If age for purchasing a weapons is 21. Than so should be voting, military enlistment, and having a child.

But Trump & his cronies are richer than ever. Highest corporate profits in history, stock buy-backs & dividends.

3947 2018-05-29 00:22:18 Well, it is pretty much the same weapon, except that the full-auto version isn’t offered to the public. However, this can be nullified with the enhancement of bump-stocks. Most combat vets would tell you that semi-auto mode is more accurate and deadly at range anyways
3948 2018-05-29 00:22:15 There is absolutely no sane reason to continue producing a piece of hardware that can cause so much damage and pain.  Ban bump stocks .

3956 2018-05-29 00:18:39 Aussie shares off to a flat start on Tuesday. #ASX steady at 6004.1. Market near 4-week low. Energy & mining stocks (which were heavily sold off on Monday) are lifting together with the banks #ausbiz
3957 2018-05-29 00:18:38 Not politic or ethic matters in this drama. Neither any kind of poor concern. Rather light on a kind of "blanchiement" of criminal stocks and stakes. Poor rwanda doesn.t exist any more, shisted to Kagame's ownership. Clear that arsenic Kagame looks forward to owning Arsenal fc.

3971 2018-05-29 00:14:04 You realize that 16% of stocks are owned by pension fund and 20% by mutual fund and 8% by insurance company which are by far the largest investors. So that's a large portion of the public.

3987 2018-05-29 00:11:41 Professional grade weapons do not belong in civilian hands, and bump stocks don’t exist for any other reason than to give an upgrade to an already lethal rifle. As of now, just about anyone can get one, and it’s unacceptable. #BanBumpStocks
