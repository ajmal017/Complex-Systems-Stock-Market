9 2018-07-29 22:46:12 Instagram, facebook, snapchat are all commodities. It's Pop culture with increased cultural value. Like it or not. But it shouldn't be like that. Pretty poses and golden hour selfies shouldn't add value to a person. The ideas shared here should!
10 2018-07-29 22:43:27 Yep. Something like oil (and other commodities) will always have a value as it’s used in the production process to create value. $BTC doesn’t assist value creation in the same way (yet).

But give it a thought why no one is willing to pay 50k or just 10k for Oil? Greater fools Theory applies there too.
13 2018-07-29 22:32:50 Yeah, i can understand, for once i want so much more and to do much more than i actually do, but the commodities of everyday life are many... However, trust me when i say this:

41 2018-07-29 21:37:27 Banks dont create currency. They create financial assets and liabilities simultaneously denominated in units of the currency. They create currency contracts, which are very similar to derivatives such as futures and forwards on other commodities
42 2018-07-29 21:30:34 The commodity crisis is a few years off. First, we'll be dealing with a deflationary bust where commodities will falling to the floor.

44 2018-07-29 21:29:28 He understands now why NZ was spared the worst of the downturn, even though he didn't talk about it much during his tenure. China bought commodities on an unprecedented scale. Saved our bacon. #rpt
45 2018-07-29 21:19:07 “Can’t wean ourselves from tariffs”. So many supply chains are completely international now.  Even if some companies wanted to, there are no domestic sources on many commodities.  Due to a number of factors including labor costs, environmental laws, technology.
46 2018-07-29 21:10:15 Nigeria doesn't even know which problem to tackle now. Is it Boko Haram,  fulani and farmers, kidnappers plus arm robbers, corruption, unemployment, high price of commodities, electricity, tribalism and illiteracy.
47 2018-07-29 21:07:40 Chile podrá descansar tranquilo, la demanda de cobre y commodities continuará. Considerando que sólo el 17% de las exportaciones chinas van a EE.UU. Esta mega ruta comercial sólo disminuirá tal porcentaje
48 2018-07-29 21:03:32 A solution must be found, and we should be targeting the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestries in South Africa. They are the department dealing with farming commodities. 7000 lions are still breeding for the bullet, skinned at the abattoirs and exported as skin/bone
49 2018-07-29 20:45:21 They do that. There are 15 nutrition assistance programs overseen by USDA. Some of them purchase surplus commodities and provide them to food banks etc. It’s a big part of the nutrition title in the Farm bill, which is coincidentally being reauthorized this year.

52 2018-07-29 20:39:36 Oh God ! His face says it all. That was so uncomfortable. He hated it. What is with people treating celebs like commodities ?! You can't treat them like that and say you love them 
53 2018-07-29 20:27:51 Desperation and previous conditions do not give anybody the right to treat helpless humans in inhumane ways or as commodities over which money exchanges hands. Again, this is a human rights issue.
54 2018-07-29 20:21:58 What effects and where and what commodities. Other countries depend on tariffs for revenue to fund social programs. They can't cut tariffs. But they need us and we don't need them. Our economy is booming while theirs is stagnant.
55 2018-07-29 20:12:13 #NBSTheScore 
I think your misleading the public; no sales agreement has been made by lusaka commodities, its sc villa jogoo selling and releasing the players, lusaka just bankrolls the club and buying of players
56 2018-07-29 20:06:34 We don’t have oil. Nor do we have the richness of other primary commodities anymore. Our costs of production are the highest in the world now for gold. 
Time to become a service economy and really add value.
Look how Singapore did it.
57 2018-07-29 20:04:22 So discounting deflationary hard landing. Even with Asian trading partners, Europe, copper/commodities all pointing towards this possibility. ..
58 2018-07-29 19:46:22 There are "real powers" behind the transactions of this world... And we, humans( though pivotal), are just a part of the commodities being traded back and forth in the floor.

59 2018-07-29 19:41:56 Of course the SW universe also has backasswards economics in that ships and equipment appear to be cheap and simple, but military grade *fuel* and other commodities are easily refined by simple infrastructure but comparatively expensive.
60 2018-07-29 19:41:39 Mr. Paul there 7.6 billion people that need to eat everyday. When food commodities go down in price poor people are happy. Rich people are disappointed. BRICS has been increasing agriculture 6-8% compounded yearly.  U can't blame failure on someone else's success.
61 2018-07-29 19:37:23 Yes.

+1 commodities backed currency.
62 2018-07-29 19:27:28 @NoMansSky Are trade commodities still in the game because I have got an economy scammer but cannot find a use for it in terms of trading anymore :/
63 2018-07-29 19:24:13 4% q/q growth is possible if you have enough control of the currency and enough Fixed income from debt  deals.   But must surely be less sustainable when built on goods, services, commodities that are attachable in retaliation to trade controls
64 2018-07-29 19:11:05 An agricultural subsidy is a governmental subsidy paid to agribusinesses, agricultural organizations and farms to supplement their income, manage the supply of agricultural commodities, and influence the cost and supply of such commodities. Fancy way to say socialism.
65 2018-07-29 19:07:57 But the behavior of stocks as assets is different from the likes of land, commodities, gold n cash...

Stock has social values also...
66 2018-07-29 18:53:41 The pink tax applies to more than just tampons. Women pay more than men, on average, 42% of the time. Granted, they are on commodities like personal care products, clothing and car repairs, but things that generally both men and women buy & use consistently.
67 2018-07-29 18:51:22 I'd say not in a conventional sense because it's not going to impact the larger economy, but for average participants it's going to be a much harder hit.  Mainly looking at prices for things like Food and Commodities.  Hard to benchmark with the impact from trade policy tho.
68 2018-07-29 18:50:41 They were the world's leading producer of oil, coal, iron, cement, manganese, gold, natural gas and other minerals. At the peak, the economy was estimated ~60% the size of the US in terms of the estimated commodities. Their centrally planned socialist economy did all that.
69 2018-07-29 18:46:00 Well done now how about  doing something about those of us that are struggling with commodities like HIV and diabetes and no proper support especially now that it's been confirmed that interms of living with conditions managing it is being linked 2 type 1 diabetes
70 2018-07-29 18:42:41 Also, of the traditional commodities of greatest value, many or most are likely to be obsolete when space travel. Precious metals and stones are going to be more commonplace when we have access to more than one planet, not to mention asteroids.
71 2018-07-29 18:38:41 Certain banks & financial institutions had no commodities .The then chancellor sold UK gold in bulk forcing down the price ,so the banks could buy the gold back at a profit ,Therefore saving these banks/financial houses in 1999/2002
72 2018-07-29 18:32:56 che perdoname pero tu bio es más una expresión de deseo que una realidad?

está todo mal escrito, chabón. cómo no vamos a pensar que son todos unos cabeza de mierda?
73 2018-07-29 18:28:48 I look at currencies like commodities. Their prices, in other currencies, are largely determined by demand and supply of the local and foreign units. That is to say they are determined by monetary policy of the day.
74 2018-07-29 18:25:23 En resumen somos serios pero (y) poco innovadores. 
Dependemos todavía demasiado de las herencias que cada tanto recibimos (commodities)
75 2018-07-29 18:21:39 Hostile environment, or the very Orwellian sounding 'compliant environment', is probably the largest contributor to it I would say. Brexit basically gave licence to elected officials, in all parties, to pitch migrants front and centre as disposable commodities rather than people.
76 2018-07-29 18:20:19 I feel that human emotions are treated like commodities way too often.
77 2018-07-29 18:09:33 Such sick minds are in every religion. They consider woman as commodities. They forget if woman were not there, such a***oles will not be in existence.

81 2018-07-29 17:45:03 .When Wall St. starts selling them on the commodities exchange, then yeah, probably for awhile anyway...
82 2018-07-29 17:33:03 Also characterized by inelastic demand (college is arguable) and like other such commodities where the opportunity for abuse is so great (power, heat, water) they need strong govt intervention on pricing and safety net.  Housing, food and internet may also be under protected.
83 2018-07-29 17:21:11 In the 80s my investment banker friends’ mantra was “we give them paper($$$$) they give us goods/commodities/things etc”
84 2018-07-29 17:18:54 @PeggyNoonanNYC
@GOP can't FOOL #VOTERS w #2Q

REASON 2Q = 4.1% is #TrumpTariffs

FACT: Before #TARIFFS took effect RAISING PRICES on #Soybean & myriad #COMMODITIES by @REALdonaldtrumP, 
#CHINA et al MOVED UP their PURCHASES into 2Q, which inflated 2Q activity by as much as 1%.
85 2018-07-29 17:10:39 Kan je volgen als ik je zeg dat tussen 2014-2018 de inflatie gemiddeld 2.5% steeg (niet-cumulatief), terwijl electronica & cars -0.9%/jaar goedkoper werden, maar commodities 5%/jaar duurder ?
86 2018-07-29 17:08:17 Love and appreciation are rare commodities these days. Carrying  is absolete.
87 2018-07-29 17:07:49 De officiële en algemene inflatie is sinds 2014 geen 25%, maar inflatie van bepaalde commodities zeker wel. Lees het artikel. Tss 2015-2017 verdubbelde de suikerprijs bvb. Of is dat te moeilijk om te begrijpen voor je ? 
88 2018-07-29 17:06:23 Ah, the unanswerable questions. Being a small tenant farmer I can say my grandchildren won't be raising bulk commodities. But they could produce food.

90 2018-07-29 16:58:30 Abortion and the attack on masculinity is where much of the degeneration of morals starts. Men voluntarily gave up their rights as fathers and no longer even attempt to protect their children. Women became murderers to get their desires met. Children are commodities to be used.
91 2018-07-29 16:52:00 All these articles about how young people can't afford a home because of other capitalist commodities we're expected to consume are so close to getting it.
92 2018-07-29 16:47:58 "Rivalrous" healthcare is the problem. We're all commodities and no company wants a bunch of unprofitable commodities.
93 2018-07-29 16:45:31 America has to admit to its innermost self, that the Pursuit of Happiness has morphed into an Economy based mostly on Extortion. The costs of all necessities and most commodities has risen tenfold in the last forty years, while median salaries have been flatlined.

95 2018-07-29 16:39:52 Has standards of living improved or not?Has inflation at low levels,lower income tax not improved your savings?Has essential commodities availability as well as their prices  are at affordable levels?If yes acche din is visible.
96 2018-07-29 16:39:22 Military, police and roads are an actual duty the state is required to provide for the public. College and healthcare are commodities. If the government were take over those private industries and redistribute money to them, that is Socialism. It would also mean 60% taxes for all
97 2018-07-29 16:36:44 Time to stay calm. The soybean cash comes from the Dept of Agriculture. Using a 1933 depression era program that allows them to lend as a price support for commodities. There is no Dept of wall in the government thank goodness. The last thing we need is another government agency.
98 2018-07-29 16:32:20 DDG’s are sold on the World market. Beef farmers in Ontario can not compete for land when it comes up for sale vs Supply management commodities or cash crop farmers. If this continues beef farming in Ontario will be gone in 10 years
99 2018-07-29 16:29:38 Remarkable what the vast majority of people on the planet think about dogs (and other non-human living things). Just commodities for our 'enjoyment'. Sad...

103 2018-07-29 15:59:01 But hey. He should wait until one of his financial commodities — I mean players — gets held at gunpoint in his own home like Ving Rhames did, and gets shot. Because then he’d suffer loss on an investment. And that’s what those Black boys are for!
104 2018-07-29 15:57:28 I love it when MMT folks and socialists say we can have something other than a money economy—say, like with commodities or barter, rather than paper money. 

Every transaction in the market is an attempt to replace paper money with commodities/capital goods.
105 2018-07-29 15:42:01 This is not a solution  to sell govt cos to pvt one and giving them right decide prices of commodities. Making employees of psu job less and punish their families. Why not shut down ministries as they failed in performing duties. Why every time common people.
106 2018-07-29 15:34:04 Haven’t had much experience with crypto limit orders yet, but we had the issue of slippage even with a limit order for commodities and forex. Is slippage a big issue in #crypto ?

In commodities & forex, it was a major issue even with limit orders.

108 2018-07-29 15:23:53 We need to pressure Mexico and other  countries to help their people where they can prosper in their country not come over and change our culture. Mexico has oil, minerals, vacation destinations and other commodities to help its people. They have no middle class.
109 2018-07-29 15:23:34 Hey, I would love to have your feedback on the R&D Primer of @TheSunProtocol, utilities in a container, deployed in rural economies, incentivizing optimal use of available solar power - initially, leads to virtual commodities - programmed to represent (socio-economic?!) values

112 2018-07-29 15:08:33 The farmers don’t want a “bail out.” The want a market for their commodities.  The big problem for them right now is that their financial troubles extend beyond trade agreements and tariffs.
113 2018-07-29 14:59:00 Amazing, it would have made the Top Ten List of Obama’s Quarters but NOT without the mad scramble to export all the Commodities that will soon be tariffed. It’s a ghost spike.
114 2018-07-29 14:43:24 A cold, tactful dispatcher seduces a sleepy, polite commodities sales agent.
115 2018-07-29 14:39:53 Bunch of rotting commodities crap.
116 2018-07-29 14:12:05 ... due to panicked, one-time commodities sales by exporters trying to get ahead of retaliatory tariffs.
117 2018-07-29 13:52:40 Right I suppose no one would abuse this. Something for nothing teaches nothing. We were on food stamps in the 90's(commodities then i think) my dad was a laid off electrician. No Chistmas etc. He took a job 100 miles from home, worked his ass off and became a local contractor.
118 2018-07-29 13:47:26 You promised that Mexico will pay for the wall. Now tax payers will pay for the wall and billions to subsidize farmers and who knows what else. Taxes for the rich were slashed. All goods & commodities are so expensive. Middle class have to prop up both rich & poor. Oy vey!
119 2018-07-29 13:45:23 Oil & graphite are sought after commodities. The black markets will thrive. Also, this economic choke collar will surely trigger an escalation of tensions. The trap is set. The US and it's allies in the region (UAE, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Jordan, etc.) are ready to attack.
120 2018-07-29 13:42:12 No jobs but government raises tax on basic commodities, but Kenyans come 2022 still they will be singing Kumira Kumira  and they will wake up at 4 kupiga kura #walewale #TheKenyanHustle

122 2018-07-29 13:22:49 To help with crops like soybeans, corn, dairy, pork, and beans... the US government will use rest of money to buy commodities and distribute them to banks and schools across country...
123 2018-07-29 13:18:44 Moral of this is that you'll know the actual price of commodities in market...
124 2018-07-29 13:07:27 Well let’s see what this week has in store for @BMRGroupplc 
also involved are @JubileeMetals and @GalileoResource via star zinc 
Working together to go forward in such a positive commodities market especially with Vanadium outlook looking so positive it’s How we need to know 

125 2018-07-29 13:04:38 Stop feeding them! Soup kitchens, Commodities, Food stamps, etc.
126 2018-07-29 12:59:47 Increase in tax of mining firm will not affect commodities and inflation. We can push for that.
127 2018-07-29 12:59:05 In what way? Do you know the amount of jobs that have been lost? Nigeria now has the most poor people in the world passing India.
Naira has lost value. Commodities are more expensive than ever. Security as bad as ever. Govt official still stealing.
So how is it better?
128 2018-07-29 12:58:13 Animals are NOT commodities!
129 2018-07-29 12:57:12 Because commodities were dumped to avoid the tariffs.  Eco101.  You must’ve been hurting from the bone spurs. #TrumpLies
130 2018-07-29 12:49:32 Doing this in concerte w/ China, I posted bunch months back.
Not only what they are doing but seeming collective effort. I keep going back to BRICS v SWIFT. Vantage point says they are trying>shift global currency, no one's talking abt tariff's & US futures or commodities markets
131 2018-07-29 12:45:41 I think it is interesting you view these women as commodities that you "get" rather than actual human beings.
132 2018-07-29 12:34:13 Does the mean cryptos (especially decentralized ones) will then be considered currencies and to be taxed appropriately vs treating them as commodities?
133 2018-07-29 12:32:10 Economy should also get a D/E tbh. Not much has changed, prices of everyday commodities are pretty much still inflated.
134 2018-07-29 12:17:17 Kindly think of poor of India also ? Prices of gas r very high , diseal and petrol prices r at all time high , prices of essential commodities r soaring high into the sky , small and marginal bussiness is not harrying loans from banks as our banking system is bankrupt now
135 2018-07-29 12:11:25 7.6 billion people on the planet. Governments can play with tariffs on food commodities all they like. Bottom line supply n demand is in effect. If food is abundant prices go lower 7 billion people are extremely happy. Only the rich are disappointed.
136 2018-07-29 11:47:15 I rather recommend u to sit down and learn the #startup #Ecosystem coz it seems you've a limited understanding of it . You seem to be used of traders with physical commodities. As i stressed it previously @antale would help you learn. Don't embarrassed yourself cc @shimadios
137 2018-07-29 11:45:30 Capitalism thrives on your addiction, it thrives on your weakness in the face of its tantalizing, poisonous, commodities.
138 2018-07-29 11:44:15 Then, if you wanted2get in2 commodities, cash is the actual commodity, which depending on the traders, means the actual commodity instead of the hedge/specualtion in the cash/cash futures market.  Financing here would be illegal rates, unless it went thru exchange/members,etc...
139 2018-07-29 11:42:29 Crypto, Commodities, Stocks, Weed related & Tech Start ups Ain’t no turning back Win Lose or Draw  $BTC $XLM
140 2018-07-29 11:40:36 Which points to long term inflation, currency weakness. Thus rising inflation and int rates in West. Commodities, stocks, ind linked bonds. @j0nathandavis
141 2018-07-29 11:40:14 The stories are actually related. Trump values the offspring of the rich; he treats the offspring of the poor as commodities.
142 2018-07-29 11:39:48 Just ruminating on my economic study for today. Marginal cost = Marginal Return so for commodities long run economic returns will only = $0
143 2018-07-29 11:36:03 Historically, there has been a bull market in the commodities every 20 or 30 years.
144 2018-07-29 11:32:25 Where do they get it from..Brazil? Logistical nightmare? China is suffering from this...soybeans will shift to other countries...its the hardest of all commodities because of dependence on china... but not impossible
145 2018-07-29 11:24:55 Agree completely on comments about China's trade account. If we take the commodities out, how would India's current account look ?
146 2018-07-29 11:12:03 Commodities will have a tough time as the liquidity vacuum continues to support and drive flows into USD, compounding the eurodollar shortage, combining with weaker Chinese import demand and a falling RMB. I'd be watching SE Asia, AZD, Brazil. Turkey also a $450B default risk.
147 2018-07-29 11:04:32 Why do prices at gas stations drop in the evening for 3-4 hrs by 10 cents?  Does it mean that price of barrel has gone down for few hrs or the price before and after drop was inflated?  Imagine if grocery stores and manufacturers did this due to other commodities price changes.
148 2018-07-29 10:54:51 We are entering a very dangerous period for assets & the global economy. 
The Fed is engaging in QT. ECBl begins next year. Liquidity will dry up. That could send the price of stocks, property, bonds and commodities 
(including oil & gold) tumbling leading to severe recession.
149 2018-07-29 10:53:42 Commodities are fungible and traded for pennies. 

Hospital administration that misunderstands this will cost their organization hundreds of thousands of dollars.
150 2018-07-29 10:49:15 Hey Commodities London(@commoditieslon), thank you for following me
151 2018-07-29 10:30:17 Le propusimos a este cretino en 1999 descontarle contratos de commodities a futuro para invertirlos en infraestructura de servicios y civil, pero que fuesen administrados por la banca internacional y nos dijo que si nosotros creíamos q el no era capaz de hacerlo...
152 2018-07-29 10:19:14 Votre système ressemble au système d'autres commodities. Comme erdf, rff ou autres. Pour autant la santé est faite pour les médecins et autres soignants ou pour les patients ou les personnes en situation de handicap ? Quelle analyse fonctionnelle ?
153 2018-07-29 10:17:44 I wonder why it has Speaker Gloria Arroyo who has to advise the President to solve the rising inflation on the prices of basic commodities. Aba'y nakapapagtaka. Why the economic team of the President did not do the same advice? Ano ba sila mga tamad? Kailangang ibang tao pa
154 2018-07-29 10:11:17 No, you're right that she didn't explicitly say that. However, the tweet about coffee / cinema tickets implied very heavily that buying second hand books was comparable to stealing those commodities, and I did not agree with that implication.
155 2018-07-29 09:36:32 Let’s start. Stop selling off the place to the highest bidder. What we have today will be worth more tomorrow. Land and food are the commodities of the future. Why r we selling for a quick $ fix? Minority groups exert to much power
156 2018-07-29 09:32:05 I've recently read that @HouseGOP are quietly & secretly relaxing tariffs on some commodities entering the USA .. Obviously they are making huge $$$ as each company is likely paying bribe money to have these dropped .. Our entire government is corrupt from top to bottom ..
157 2018-07-29 09:15:17 Looking forward to the #AVZ quarterly next week, coupled with maiden JORC! #Lithium #Tin both hot, in demand commodities 
158 2018-07-29 09:14:48 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
159 2018-07-29 09:12:53 DEMA jest wskaźnikiem, który został zaprezentowany przez Patricka Mulloy'a w grudniu 1994 r. w czasopiśmie Technical Analisys of Stocks & Commodities. DEMA jest skrótem oznaczającym Double Exponential Moving Average. Jednakże, nazwa tej techniki gładzenia jest trochę myląca,
160 2018-07-29 09:02:05 currency war eliminating the I mpact on dollar-denominated commodities.
161 2018-07-29 08:32:38 No doubt. American lives (not only American however) have become commodities taken for granted.
162 2018-07-29 08:23:29 Boom das commodities? Não é bem verdade. Uma política cambial inteligente e a retomada da política de fomento as exportações com o BNDES tiveram muito a ver com isso.
163 2018-07-29 08:18:58 but treacle still happening for less soggy commodities!
164 2018-07-29 08:17:32 Saw the Lehman Trilogy last night. A fine play, which basically traced the company's downfall to its loss of connection with tangible commodities and people. But the actual events of 2008 were rushed.
165 2018-07-29 08:13:51 Former VP at JP Morgan says the Kvantor concept is the first B2B-focused model with the integration of Commodities Exchange services she has seen so far #KVANTOR
#kvantor, #cryptocurrency, #altcoins, #cryptocurrency, #ITO,#ICO, #Blockchain
166 2018-07-29 08:02:30 More importantly, why is pre-season starting already?! Professional rugby will destroy its biz model if it doesn’t come to grips with the value of scarcity. Bad enough it treats athletes like disposable commodities.
167 2018-07-29 07:53:10 Back in town!  #trading #Commodities #copper
168 2018-07-29 07:43:51 Things bought in a small village shop that sells everything always seem far more exciting than the same things bought in a supermarket. Like found treasures, not commodities.
169 2018-07-29 07:22:25 Isso é bem verdade! Ainda mais com a economia extremamente dependente do ciclo de commodities...aí não se sustenta mesmo!
170 2018-07-29 07:12:42 In any world, workers (especially the migrant workers) are disposable commodities.
171 2018-07-29 07:11:35 I would prefer the EFT and future stayed part of the old corrupted financial system, look where it’s got the meatals and commodities markets prices are artificially manipulated down 
172 2018-07-29 07:05:03 3260: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
173 2018-07-29 06:33:07 Understand but I don’t consider it particularly relevant. The price on average is reflective of cost of production plus a (fluctuating) margin. All commodities operate similarly
174 2018-07-29 06:23:42 Wrongly headlined, in general election Pakistan woman who r budget manager felt inflation, price hike of basic commodities, no electricity, gas n water. They turned out in force to elect an honest upright man to solve daily issues. Voting is not taboo in Pak.
175 2018-07-29 06:11:20 When fear mongering folks in elevated positions speak to disastrous outcomes such as medical and food shortages they are lying to the people. The only way that such commodities/products will not enter UK is if they are held in our ports by UK authorities. A punishment plan?
176 2018-07-29 06:05:03 3253: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
177 2018-07-29 06:00:38 I am still waiting for the Dullard to make 1naira=1dollar, and return the economy and prices of goods and commodities to how he met them before he leaves that seat next year
178 2018-07-29 05:53:08 I have a book to add to the list; Jake Bernstein's 1st book, "Handbook on Commodity Cycles, A Window in Time."  It's a great ok on cycles, although it's directed at commodities.  And there's always books/material from Edward Dewey... great list though
179 2018-07-29 05:51:21 Metals n commodities historically carries a low multiple..

Bank esp psu hv hardly had any earning prior to this are so where is q of PE wen E is missing
180 2018-07-29 05:50:39 It's high time to stop taking more passenger's than the allocated seats, I have seen conductor's treating passenger's as commodities. 
Ensure passenger safety.
181 2018-07-29 05:47:21 126.34 , but people doing business on commodities do business on floating money i:e rate of dollar in open market.
182 2018-07-29 05:40:58 That will be terrific because by their nature commodities are fungible in a global market.
183 2018-07-29 05:33:41 Niraj please bring forth updates about Currency markets and Commodities.
184 2018-07-29 04:59:48 Pakistan is an agricultural country but the common people cannot afford commodities..

186 2018-07-29 04:48:06 Every human wants a sense of heritage & continuity — traditions, shared customs, stories, cultural memories & references. Our great-etc-grandparents traded that in for White Supremacy, & now we experience a nameless bereavement; we haplessly try to fill the gap with commodities.
187 2018-07-29 04:36:24 China's engagement with not just Argentina but Latin America has left the US looking a bit flat footed. China's initial goal of securing supply lines of much needed commodities has expanded into geopolitical considerations.
188 2018-07-29 04:16:34 Bethany Christian Services (which has ties to Betsy DeVos) got a bunch of the separated kids to provide foster homes (and potentially adoptive homes) for. The government reimbursed them something like $700 per child, per night. It's scary to think these kids are commodities.
189 2018-07-29 04:11:11 There is no signed agreement & there were no details about what commodities or products he was imagining.
People let things go for the same of negotiations but when you lie about specifics to cover your arse, you're going to get called out as a liar.
There is no agreement.
190 2018-07-29 03:51:48 Si, pero la simple idea me motiva a pagar por algo, si alguien no hubiera tenido la idea de crear Shampoo pues nadie lo compraría sin importar la marca, y así con todo, aunque obviamente hay casos de excepción como los commodities
191 2018-07-29 03:44:44 The illiterate peanut picker claimed to stand behind farmers but during his admin farmers were hanging themselves in barns. Faced with 21% interest rates and a glut of commodities. This country needs to examine the "cheap food policy" enacted by former sec of ag, Earl Butz.
192 2018-07-29 03:44:34 y’all not used to dating bitches that’s are hot commodities lmao it’s gonna be niggas in my phone. peep how i’m ignoring them though.
193 2018-07-29 03:41:50 Capitalism needs to destroy the environment in order to keep producing more and more commodities with planned obsolesnce. 

Capitalism is built upon ravaging the environment, white supremacy/imperialism, and a police state to comtrol the have nots. 2/2
194 2018-07-29 03:19:58 @vasanthkamath @Nithin0dha hey! what's your planning  to implement Automated Trading in commodities?
195 2018-07-29 03:18:49 I don’t disagree. I wonder if it’s because he’s a leftie and those are always hot commodities. Plus, the only other pitcher I’d heard of in trade rumors was Sonny, and I don’t think Cash is giving up on him yet considering what we traded for him.
196 2018-07-29 03:08:15 Just stop it already. The header should read "LIE:", not "OPINION:". 45* announced with a drunks' bravado (and eloquence) the merits of reneging on US trade agreements and targeted commodities which stood to benefit himself financially or satisfy personal vendettas. #ImpeachTrump
197 2018-07-29 03:06:55 The oil industry has been trying to control energy since it's inception. In doing some research I found that this is a problem that spans the centuries; those who control key commodities control the world, or at least the known one given the time period. They all fell eventually.
198 2018-07-29 03:02:49 Some of that 4% GDP could be attributed to companies stocking up/hoarding commodities that were going to be affected by Dufus Donny's impending trade war.
199 2018-07-29 03:02:47 People who speculate on commodities are engaged in toxic rent-seeking behaviors that are bad for out country and economy. 

Nerd.
200 2018-07-29 03:00:50 Instead of paying farm corps to not grow crops in order to lower supply relative to demand, the government should purchase those commodities at the lowest reasonable market rate and then distribute them charitably or, where appropriate, to school lunch programs.
201 2018-07-29 02:54:11 Simple views for simple minded people. There are plenty of legit issues with socializing commodities (determining rations, perpetual dissatisfied citizens, formation of black markets, loss of option variety, government bureaucry consuming funding)
202 2018-07-29 02:44:30 do ponto de vista de pesquisa acadêmica, é interessante você estabelecer dezenas e centenas de correlações pra corroborar ou falsificar determinadas hipóteses e-ou teorias.....algumas commodities obedecem 80-90% a essa correlação com o dolar...outras menos....
203 2018-07-29 02:31:28 o que acontece é que a pancada sobre as commodities é tão forte que é muito mas muito superior ao benefício em reais;.esse "benefício "superior a pancada" só acontece quando o dólar se desloca com muito mais força por alguma "questão local";isso somente aconteceu em 2002-2003
204 2018-07-29 02:17:40 Dólar forte não seria Commodities em reais forte? = Bom para exportadores?
205 2018-07-29 02:03:30 Drugs muddle up your self-understanding, you become a mushroom suckling on capitalist commodities.
206 2018-07-29 02:00:52 So apparently #Cameroon exports have dropped by an average of more than 28% in almost all sectors within the first half of 2018, while imports have increased even in sectors such as basic food commodities. And you wonder the effect of #AnglophoneCrisis
207 2018-07-29 01:55:43 6. Read what Constitution says dealing with gold and silver.  Congress should back money with gold, silver, other valuable commodities, federal government owned lands, etc. State government and Congress should work together on fair trade agreements that help them obtain more gold
208 2018-07-29 01:54:48 Yo siempre me pregunto por qué el Estado no produce alimentos y sus propias commodities... Como si le faltara tierras fiscales para hacerlo. Es más, podría comprar campos para no depender de las 1000 familias.
209 2018-07-29 01:26:01 La pensamos sin industria de alto valor agregado, exportadora de commodities, y expectantes que el campo nos va a salvar a todos cuando solo tiene intención de salvarse ellos...
Todo mal.
210 2018-07-29 01:21:48 Graças ao boom INTERNACIONAL das commodities. Depois disso tb desceu ladeira abaixo a economia do país. Depois de tudo o que já se sabe sobre esse bandido com as delações da odebrescht e com a futura delação de palocci ainda defendem o 9 dedos??

213 2018-07-29 01:06:41 Art, individuality, creativity, raw talent - these commodities are ignored for the most part by big media industries until they build up enough groundswell that a corporate entity can safely feel that they can monetize it.

Real art is from and for the  and soul.
214 2018-07-29 00:54:07 That moment when a libertarian doesn’t understand what currency, legal tender, commodities, or money are and ends up arguing that pigs are money.
215 2018-07-29 00:52:53 when inflation causes prices (commodities) to fall, then even central bank critics are neutralized...
216 2018-07-29 00:45:34 Debemos invertir+en I&D y en diversificar la economía, pero el desafío no pasa por demonizar las commodities. Lo contrario: el mundo moderno demanda más que nunca cobre,alimentos,litio, etc y las empresas chilenas son muy competitivas en producirlos. 
217 2018-07-29 00:42:18 Çok güzel. İşaret buyurduğunuz listede de “major commodities exporters”a bakacaksınız zaten.Satıp paraya çeviremediğin tüketim fazlan yoksa, üstelik tarımsal üretim (hayvancılık da dahil) kendi kendine yeter durumda değilsen kıymeti harbiyesi yok, diyorum,ama anlatanıyorum. Neyse
218 2018-07-29 00:35:50 @bernardolarrain  Leo en lo que publicas  de Moody que el problema que tiene Chile es su dependencia de las commodities de las cuales no logra zafarse. ¿O cada cual lee lo que quiere?
219 2018-07-29 00:26:34 Hey, how about calling the liar in chief on his misleading claim on the economy.  Trade war inflated numbers for ag commodities artificially pumped growth.  Real growth was between 2% and 3.5%.
220 2018-07-29 00:24:30 You're the past Talia, your time is over. You are a has been. At least it's better than a never was like Athena. The hottest commodities, Aubrey and myself will not be paying shit.
221 2018-07-29 00:19:26 Without hubris, a commodities trader is nothing but a network administrator.
222 2018-07-27 23:57:32 It’s rigging the commodities market with fear.
223 2018-07-27 23:57:18 wait 

so at OU is it a breech of contract if you (as a faculty member) utilize university commodities off campus..?
224 2018-07-27 23:45:48 You think this could be the opening feeling-out process that eventually ends up with Texas absorbing most of Choo’s contract in a move to CLE? They’ve already demonstrated a willingness to part with talent for proven commodities.
225 2018-07-27 23:39:11 True, but again the more watered down, the more campy, the more simplistic and kid friendly, does not help my interest in these movies. I recognize the Nolan’s and Snyder’s are extremely rare commodities, but the MCU has been literally poison for my mind.

229 2018-07-27 22:50:51 Nobody cares who they bring up.Why isn’t anyone questioning how the Jays have miss managed their assets into worthless commodities. That’s the story. Look at the list of players, the idea is to trade them when you can get something for them. Not just this yr either EE, JB etc too

233 2018-07-27 22:32:43 Trad pub doesn't give you as much marketing/advertising help as you think. They only have so many marketing dollars to go around, and they spend it on their "proven commodities." It's not worth giving up the creative control, IMO.
234 2018-07-27 22:11:05 State antitrust laws applicable to corporations but not to individuals, or to vendors of commodities but not to vendors of labor, have been upheld.
235 2018-07-27 22:03:35 I saw Trump of TV with with his numbers. He was really bragging. But if the news was so good, why did the stock market go down .3%? Why are wages stagnant? Why does the government have to bail our farmers? Why are Americans paying higher prices for many commodities.?#Economics
236 2018-07-27 22:00:01 Who can determine what part had been found a ready sacrifice of the commodities of every plaintiff or prosecutor.
237 2018-07-27 21:50:56 Keep in mind that this reflect the corporat tax giveaway, and overpurchases in light of expected tarrifs on good and commodities (soybeans). Like it gave investors time to short commodities and make a killing. Plebeians can’t function with moneyed people, they are not you friend
238 2018-07-27 21:50:07 Privacy has shifted from a notion of liberal rights to neoliberal control of info-commodities.
239 2018-07-27 21:48:56 Also, my tweet isn’t just about the exploitation of labor, it’s also about how it’s wrong to treat humans like commodities. The view that immigrants are important because they do stuff we don’t want to is inherently racist because you’re reducing them to nothing but their labor.
240 2018-07-27 21:40:00 Asked today: "If 'Brexit means Brexit and we're going to make a success of it' then why does the same person feel it necessary to stockpile medicines, food and other commodities?"

Reasonable enough question.

244 2018-07-27 23:45:48 You think this could be the opening feeling-out process that eventually ends up with Texas absorbing most of Choo’s contract in a move to CLE? They’ve already demonstrated a willingness to part with talent for proven commodities.
245 2018-07-27 23:39:11 True, but again the more watered down, the more campy, the more simplistic and kid friendly, does not help my interest in these movies. I recognize the Nolan’s and Snyder’s are extremely rare commodities, but the MCU has been literally poison for my mind.
246 2018-07-27 23:36:53 The whole market fell , Dow Nasdaq ...i bought the dip... I sold some Bonds & I bought some Weed & Gold Stocks & some essential Commodities   Going Moon. $BTC $XLM $ETC $ETH $BCH $ICX $LTC

249 2018-07-27 22:50:51 Nobody cares who they bring up.Why isn’t anyone questioning how the Jays have miss managed their assets into worthless commodities. That’s the story. Look at the list of players, the idea is to trade them when you can get something for them. Not just this yr either EE, JB etc too
250 2018-07-27 22:40:47 He was a bipartisan president, he had to be the South was threatening the world market by undervaluing commodities, like cotton and peanuts, it brought the fact they were using slaves to the front page across the northern hemisphere

253 2018-07-27 22:32:43 Trad pub doesn't give you as much marketing/advertising help as you think. They only have so many marketing dollars to go around, and they spend it on their "proven commodities." It's not worth giving up the creative control, IMO.
254 2018-07-27 22:11:05 State antitrust laws applicable to corporations but not to individuals, or to vendors of commodities but not to vendors of labor, have been upheld.
255 2018-07-27 22:03:35 I saw Trump of TV with with his numbers. He was really bragging. But if the news was so good, why did the stock market go down .3%? Why are wages stagnant? Why does the government have to bail our farmers? Why are Americans paying higher prices for many commodities.?#Economics
256 2018-07-27 22:00:01 Who can determine what part had been found a ready sacrifice of the commodities of every plaintiff or prosecutor.
257 2018-07-27 21:50:56 Keep in mind that this reflect the corporat tax giveaway, and overpurchases in light of expected tarrifs on good and commodities (soybeans). Like it gave investors time to short commodities and make a killing. Plebeians can’t function with moneyed people, they are not you friend
258 2018-07-27 21:50:07 Privacy has shifted from a notion of liberal rights to neoliberal control of info-commodities.
259 2018-07-27 21:48:56 Also, my tweet isn’t just about the exploitation of labor, it’s also about how it’s wrong to treat humans like commodities. The view that immigrants are important because they do stuff we don’t want to is inherently racist because you’re reducing them to nothing but their labor.
260 2018-07-27 21:40:00 Asked today: "If 'Brexit means Brexit and we're going to make a success of it' then why does the same person feel it necessary to stockpile medicines, food and other commodities?"

Reasonable enough question.

263 2018-07-27 21:25:58 @John_Stepek What did you think of Ray Dalio's all weather asset allocation?
30% Stocks
40% Long-Term Bonds
15% Intermediate-Term Bonds
7.5% Gold
7.5% Commodities
for the 30 year period 84-13 you made 9.7% annually:
from 84-13 - 9.7% annual returns vol 7.6% worst loss -3.9%
264 2018-07-27 21:21:49 I like the theory that sudden surge in selling of soybeans and other commodities (hoping to beat tariff deadlines) was largely responsible (also, non-recurring)...
265 2018-07-27 21:17:50 The subsidies do not support produce. The subsidies are for corn, soy, cotton, and tobacco. That's to rig the commodities market and to make American exports cheap enough to undercut local foods elsewhere. Subsidies almost never go to small farms or places that grow food.
266 2018-07-27 21:02:20 You’re using subtlety. & nuance. Both rare commodities theses days.
267 2018-07-27 20:52:55 how much of Venezuela's problems come from American interference and embargos? How much comes from CIA interference? How much comes from tying its economy so tightly to oil commodities? How much comes from its political class and mismanagement?
268 2018-07-27 20:51:10 No, Donnie, it means businesses are investing - they're not investing in jobs, they're investing in the stock market and short-selling American commodities that are being wiped out by your trade war.
269 2018-07-27 20:45:32 While all those may be true they’re not supposed to be the judge of the underlying commodity. It’s about the product being issued itself. Many of those statements hold true for many commodities traded already that have ETPs.
270 2018-07-27 20:32:51 Isn't it more cost effective to let the children reunite with whoever brought them ? 

And why the f&ck ship them across the country,  like commodities???

272 2018-07-27 20:22:08 Only way to stop and control crime is to regulate and tax commodities that people use regularly. Criminalizing just leads to massive wastes of taxpayer dollars and police capacity to impact communities
273 2018-07-27 20:20:26 And yet in a city with tens of thousands of homeless people and even more struggling to pay their rent there are at least ~74,000 units that remain empty most of the year because people are using them as pied-a-terres, tax havens, or simply commodities.

278 2018-07-27 19:35:09 There's adequate food and adequate money to buy it with. What we don't have is adequate compassion for fellow human beings to ensure that both of these commodities are adequately distributed.
279 2018-07-27 19:34:10 That's just food. I'm sure other commodities such as energy and medicine will have their own issues.
280 2018-07-27 19:32:00 The City sold taxi medallions as if they were tradable commodities. Many drivers like being their own boss and use tools like Uber to connect them to customers.

281 2018-07-27 19:31:02 Hay una concepción equivocada dentro de la mente del intelectual de creer que sus ideas lo hacen una persona con mayor valor para la sociedad. El intelectual se equivoca. No ve al trabajador, gracias a quien tenemos la mayor parte de los commodities que disfrutamos.
282 2018-07-27 19:29:38 I am with you, commodities and inflation are rolling over, growth is rolling over, only a matter of time before rates do as well.  Rates can not establish a new high though. My biggest fear is the Bank of Japan.
283 2018-07-27 19:24:10 I won't bec it was a result of large exports caused by buyers purchasing commodities in anticipation of Trumps tariffs. Next quarter will show a significant drop. O's economy comes in around 2.5 on a steady basis

287 2018-07-27 19:17:41 Spain raided the Americas for gold & slaves. England raided the East for commodities, slaves & land. The US stole land (along with water, lumber & minerals etc), killed people & maintained a population of slaves. (Theft of labor is another classic form of primitive accumulation).
288 2018-07-27 19:05:14 But at least the War on Commodities (price controls) is going strong. Our economy is a cross between Goldilocks & the 3 Bears & Weekend at Bernie's. Goldilocks (commodities) didn't fall asleep she was murdered by the 3 Bears who put sunglasses on her & told everyone she was fine.
289 2018-07-27 18:56:23 Millennials are investing in highly questionable commodities like bitcoin and crypto avocado toast futures.
290 2018-07-27 18:44:12 In our lifetimes we're probably going to see the opening act of the industrialization of the solar system. There are hundreds of trillions of dollars worth of metal and water commodities just floating in the asteroid belt right now, amounts of money the world has never seen.
291 2018-07-27 18:43:46 Commodities and other widely traded stocks/assets are known to be manipulated yet still maintain their presence on the world's markets. #Bitcoin is very hard to manipulate, to the point where you need all of the world's computers to do so... Truly impossible.
292 2018-07-27 18:42:49 Its high time people know that "humans" should not be treated like commodities

294 2018-07-27 18:36:30 4.1% GDP growth for the quarter is great news and partially caused by an export boom. The boom, however, will be temporary. Buyers of commodities, like soy, purchased in this quarter in order to avoid tariffs.

298 2018-07-27 18:30:41 It’s far too easy to see this for what it is: China (and the rest of the world) spent last quarter snapping up commodities to avoid paying future tariffs. One quarter isn’t shit—especially with Dump flailing wildly at the wheel.
299 2018-07-27 18:29:02 In an open free market economy, prices won’t be controlled or capped. It’s left to the market to decide. I believe that’s how you can see the actual true price & value of commodities.
300 2018-07-27 18:21:21 Your whole thread makes my heart hurt. Writers aren't disposable commodities, they are partners who can make your career, if you let them. You could be ghosting the next @taffyakner!

307 2018-07-27 17:54:01 Meaning, take the people in the city: they all want to improve traffic congestion, reduce crime, have lower energy costs, lower food costs, etc. They consume commodities without producing many.
308 2018-07-27 17:51:27 Here's the thing, the GDP going up isn't a good thing, it's panic selling by farmers and commodities companies before the tariffs.

318 2018-07-27 17:18:22 I am sure our "former" allies didn't quickly purchase some of our commodities before the tariffs were enacted. No, this is all due to Trump's incredible financial mind. Speaking of taxes....
319 2018-07-27 17:15:47 Story is a great example of what happens when we don’t sustain and control our institutions. Malcolm and Rosa Parks converted into commodities. Approved interlocutors then narrate how they should be interpreted. Read stuff like that for location of materials and nothing else.
320 2018-07-27 17:09:51 The mainstreamers get the reality, and certainly the implications of freely-floating (vis-a-vis other currencies, commodities, precious metals, etc) fiat currency for their issuers and their holders wrong.
321 2018-07-27 17:07:58 A one-time boost in Q2 that will cost $1.7 trillion over a decade. And much of the increase is panicked buying of soybeans & commodities in advance of Trump's tariffs. "Credit" = blame to those who understand economics!

327 2018-07-27 16:42:25 Every economist of note is expressing doubt these numbers are sustainable. Given the abnormal purchase of commodities to beat the tariffs, this may be a one time thing. But quite Obama from 5 yrs ago, that’s sound understanding of economics Larry.

333 2018-07-27 16:24:29 Unlikely this will be sustained. There was a rush to sell soybeans and other commodities and goods in the 2nd Quarter before the impact of tariffs. Let’s wait to see the 3rd Quarter number before celebrating.

337 2018-07-27 16:07:17 Would be curious to see what real growth is if you net out Military & Gov. Or as someone ask Jay Powell "When does this robust economy actually help the middle class?" The HFT War against commodities rages on to save the Fed's book from a fiery death.
338 2018-07-27 16:03:31 in the 1970s many developing countries attempted to construct producer price cartels for primary commodities; they all failed due to free rising and defection when prices collapsed after 1980; only survivor is OPEC

347 2018-07-27 15:23:06 I guess you’re not smart enough to realize it’s artificially inflated due to countries buying up commodities before tariffs.
348 2018-07-27 15:22:34 To be honest, not completely satisfied. The prices of commodities are rising with no commensurate increase in earnings. The value of the naira is depreciating.
349 2018-07-27 15:16:35 This is great news...however very skewed as the data set includes the panic rush to scoop up American commodities before tariffs went into effect - I.e. China and the American Soybean. #factsmatter #thisisartificial

353 2018-07-27 15:05:34 When farmers lose because of trump tariffs and he then turns around and offers bailouts, who do you think pays for that? You can double the 12billion for administrative costs. In the meantime farmers have to pay their loans so what do you think happens to commodities’ prices?
354 2018-07-27 14:59:28 Não, se você souber olhar os gráficos de uma ótica global, e não apenas territorial, você verá que o Governo Lula só fodeu com o País como eu disse, ele se aproveitou dos ventos positivos das commodities enquanto criava o seu plano supranacional.
355 2018-07-27 14:58:18 E o Brasil exporta tecnologia ?  Não. O Brasil vive de commodities.
356 2018-07-27 14:57:21 The high 4.1 figure is good but it's the result of pent up government spending and massive frontloaded purchases of commodities to get ahead of tariffs.   In other words, it's artificially inflated and following quarters will be significantly lower.

365 2018-07-27 14:34:55 My far biggest positions are currencies and commodities.
366 2018-07-27 14:28:47 Correct! They love their money. They act like they love some players! But it's business.The players are human commodities!
367 2018-07-27 14:22:36 In your opinion, do you think that the tariffs and falling farm commodities will pull that down this quarter or do you see that rebounding?
368 2018-07-27 14:21:47 Unpopular Opinion: can we stop making other cultures as sexual commodities? Like I get that you like who you like but there's a point where shit goes too far
369 2018-07-27 14:20:43 GDP for this Q is artificially high due to tremendous buying of commodities to counteract expected negative effects of tariffs. Is the average worker benefiting? I don’t think so.
370 2018-07-27 14:19:07 @FoxBusiness  1/1 Varney, your guest who claimed to be an economics person claimed the USA is "not" getting ripped off. I owned 1/2 of a commodities trading company HQ in Sao Paulo. China charges us 25% tariff on cars, we charge 2.5%. RIP OFF!!
371 2018-07-27 14:14:46 That so called tax cut was a political hand job. I know of no one that has benefited from it especially with the higher cost of gasoline, food, commodities and services.
 Only the rich benefited from that. my point is Obama pulled us out from deep shit and handed it to trump

373 2018-07-27 14:11:06 Auto cos negotiate supply of steel in contractual agreements based on commodities pricing. This allows them to pay a steady price void of market fluctuations on a daily basis.
374 2018-07-27 14:00:33 We are arguing extremes here, though I strongly believe "employment" is part of an inferior, socialist mindset.

Employment is a bad incentive structure. It oversimplifies cost evaluation by turning people into commodities. Oversimplified pricing is anti-capitalist.

380 2018-07-27 13:30:01 Tax cuts provide a near term stimulus..i.e. 12-18 months...once those are worked through, this is what it is...but hey, if you think going to war in Iran is going to help...you're delusional...commodities will skyrocket...with inflation
381 2018-07-27 13:23:31 I am on the fence. It's great for vendors, but now that room may get more crowded and those con-exclusive, limited quantity items will be possibly even more hot commodities. I don't know.
382 2018-07-27 13:15:14 Amir Yaron at Wharton has a JF paper on commodities from the investment perspective a few years ago...

387 2018-07-27 13:00:40 Le aste erano nate per le commodities. Ma sono finite sul food molto rapidamente. Già 15 anni orsono asta al ribasso sulle marmellate per Lombardini. Lo so perché il tasto "meno" lo schiacciavo io, allora country manager di multinazionale del settore. Avvilente e svilente.

390 2018-07-27 12:55:22 one of the big boosters in those numbers are soybean orders which increased 9000% in anticipation of tariffs, along with jumps in other commodities to be impacted by their own tariffs, it's future buying meaning reduced sales in future reports

442 2018-07-27 08:29:15 This only proves that current policies have failed - they turn illicit #drugs into profitable commodities. No amount of legislation or enforcement will ever stop people taking drugs. Alcohol is more dangerous than heroin FFS but is legal. Time to try something different maybe?
443 2018-07-27 08:28:04 And without the farmers, none of those commodities would be available. Same scenario in mining.  In colonial history labour availability was always a key issue. The independent states have solved that problem by capturing the farmers & workers and handing them over to commerce.
444 2018-07-27 08:26:57 Clearly stockpiling commodities works just as well as breeding enslaved bodies post abolition. Both based upon modernisms irrelevant to valuing life, earth and integrity.

448 2018-07-27 08:10:24 No matter how you look at it, bitcoin and ethereum can be viewed as digital commodities, since they provide access to the underlying network, which can be used for various services.

456 2018-07-27 07:15:13 It is in people's DNA to trade. Salt, essential to life, was one of the first commodities to be traded – by early man. When countries refuse to trade, smuggling becomes profitable and fun.
457 2018-07-27 07:12:24 Australian steel is one of the worlds largest exported commodities.
458 2018-07-27 07:06:25 Joining EEC meant paying almost double world prices for basic food commodities, prices shot up, and have remained falsely high through tariffs applied in the EU. Leaving the EU means lower food prices.
459 2018-07-27 07:01:01 I do not think this guy likes the environment, Trump. Capitalism has its own tragedy, in the loss of nature and variety for commodities. We need to preserve our natural resources and trade for necessity's not literal garbage of consumer madness. Please?

487 2018-07-27 03:31:45 Undoubtedly, African countries cannot transform, if they continue to concentrate on producing and exporting primary commodities. Harvesting and exporting of raw materials clearly then cannot be the crux that delivers prosperity for Africa. We must move up the value addition chain
488 2018-07-27 03:27:45 Exactly. And all those external needs have well-defined and stable interfaces or are commodities. Low risk.

Not sure why this is relevant?
489 2018-07-27 03:21:23 Some of y’all say vegans are superior but meat eaters literally think animals are “here for us to eat” like can you imagine genuinely thinking that animals are just commodities
490 2018-07-27 03:15:27 Valeu!  De certa maneira, contra-intuitivo que uma carteira com ações ligadas ao mercado interno se beneficiem tanto do boom de commodities pelo país ter varias empresas nesse setor....
491 2018-07-27 03:10:31 Montei um índice com empresas antigas e com zero commodities. Tinha q ser antiga pra poder testar em período longo. Deu na mesma. O nosso indice não tinha tanta commodity assim em alguns pontos do passado. Final da década de 90 a Telebrás era 45% do ibov.

Funciona igual.
492 2018-07-27 03:04:47 A economia, a sociedade não melhora com ciclo de commodities/nem subida de bolsa. A bolsa pode estar bombando e continuar por anos e metade da população ainda continuar vivendo em favelas, sem esgoto e educação, civilidade então nem se fala.
493 2018-07-27 03:04:01 ::Trump tanks commodity prices through useless trade war, farmers sell commodities at huge losses::

Conservative commentators: VICOTORY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
494 2018-07-27 03:01:00 Bc it’s easier to predict demand for food and other commodities with a smaller population. If private industries are owned by the gov. and do not rely on the structure of supply and demand to produce their goods, the gov. would need to then predict demand and thus mandate supply.
495 2018-07-27 03:00:34 Bredda, esse resultado não seria consequência dos % no Ibov mt fortes em commodities?  Estou tentando entender aonde entrariam as Ambevs, Itaús, RD e Mglu da vida...  Uma carteira mais diversificada teria rendido mais do que uma carteira só com commodities, ou vice versa?
496 2018-07-27 02:39:28 Thanks! my metal commodities in the market are up due to this!! :) thanks! #MAGA
497 2018-07-27 02:26:35 I’m not an expert on commodities, I guess my point is you have to get your products from someplace...
498 2018-07-27 02:24:35 Tell me, how do you accurately estimate the demand for food and other commodities of 330 million people then?
499 2018-07-27 02:18:31 O Lula ajudou em q na economia? ele se aproveitou das commodities, e isso está registrado.

500 2018-07-27 02:14:23 Tokens are a representation of a particular asset or utility, that usually resides on top of a blockchain. They can represent basically any assets that are fungible and tradeable, from commodities to loyalty points or even other cryptocurrencies.

504 2018-07-27 01:32:09 If you're interested in commodities only, however, I went to school with a guy who farms 3K acres of organic rice. He only gets equipment loans for the tax write off. He uses sheep for weed control. Free fertilizer, too.
505 2018-07-27 01:26:53 Playing old tricks again. Attacking the church to divert public attention and criticisms from the issues of high prices of commodities, political debacles, widespread graft and corruptiom, etc. Kumita na yatang trick iyan!
506 2018-07-27 01:21:09 I was as horrified with Solyndra as you. As for bankruptcies, they will happen if commodities don't start going up. Soybeans from May to July have collapsed 25% so many farmers are on the brink. I'm sure that led to $12 Billion bailout. That's a liberal policy, right?
507 2018-07-27 01:17:54 Lesson I learned when I was trading commodities. How many super wealthy economists do you know? None? Why is that?
508 2018-07-27 01:16:52 "Did somebody say... politics? Because the wealth of those societies in which the capitalist mode of production prevails, presents itself as “an immense accumulation of commodities,” its unit being a single commodity.

572 2018-07-28 20:34:44 It's the idea that athletes are commodities instead of people. As long as there is money to be made and players are veiwed singularly (just run & pass), the culture won't change.
573 2018-07-28 20:23:07 Yo no digo que no hay que agregarle valor a las cosas, pero el mundo necesita commodities tb y eso lo hacemos bien, de hecho es uno de los pocos que son de vanguardia y competitivos en Argentina.
574 2018-07-28 20:13:32 2) Limited industrial production transcended to reduced exports and unbalanced trade with our major trading partners whereby we ended up being the net importer of most basic commodities. Growth at home has been next to none because of what I mentioned above.
575 2018-07-28 20:05:43 The main reason for 4.1% was that commodity producers were fast shipping their commodities before TrumpTariff became effective. Ask Chevy about their pricing or Coca-Cola about theirs.
576 2018-07-28 20:00:02 #Gold and #silver, like other #commodities, have an intrinsic value, which is not arbitrary, but is dependent on their scarcity.
577 2018-07-28 19:41:20 Has anyone seen a study or a write-up of kind of a "biography" of the Petrohawk/BHP/BP assets? Where they came from, how they got here, etc.

Capital in, capital out, commodities prices, infrastructure, lives touched, fortunes lost and won, etc.

Could be a neat little project.
578 2018-07-28 19:41:15 People are still heavily dependent on commodities, likely moreso than in ancient Greece.

The intangibles are yes, more important now. But the Library at Alexandria, Romes power derived from recording its feats, & educated elite, showed the value of knowledge was recognized then.
579 2018-07-28 19:39:46 Liquidity gotta go somewhere. My guess is commodities/steel, fins, industrials and transports. Emerging seems like a reasonable bet as well so super hated.
580 2018-07-28 19:30:48 Historical nations depended on physical exchange for value (gold, etc)

Modern nations are less dependent on commodities.

Your historical focus ignores "intangible" value founded on knowledge rather than physical assets.

587 2018-07-28 19:11:27 This was their window to cash in, and no one wanted to pull the trigger. They had a division lead around the All-Star Break, yet they would rather not risk losing potential rookies for well-known MLB commodities. Braves will never be the same.
588 2018-07-28 19:06:49 I've only seen raw data about commodities, financials, wages, and labor force in that period. Watching the real estate market since Q4, 2016, is one place to start.
589 2018-07-28 18:59:38 What it means is that insulin and other commodities coming through/via EU will be much more expensive...for us. Geddit?!
590 2018-07-28 18:54:16 Med sevices at the VA and fighters are still bought and sold as commodities. That the people who seek out/pilot them don’t themselves do the buying or selling doesn’t make them non-commodities.
591 2018-07-28 18:46:40 However, I'd dispute the premise that medical services at the VA or F-35s aren't commodities. The claim that "the military=socialism" doesn't hold up no matter the definition of socialism one cares to offer.
592 2018-07-28 18:44:19 Both corn and soy are products of corruption and collusion between big ag and the federal government, at the expense of all Americans. The over-production of these commodities has resulted in illness, obesity, and environmental pollution. You, sir, are complicit in this.
593 2018-07-28 18:44:16 Sure, but Peter Linebaugh makes the point in London Hanged that it is where commodities resulting from wealth os industrial revolution are located where property needs enforcing most violently - i.e. London. You can't steal a Coal seam or a ship can you?
594 2018-07-28 18:36:11 The big items which are weighed most heavily generally went up in price y/y, but many consumer goods got cheaper. Shelter is the single item weighed most heavily, as it should be. Then food, then energy. (technically commodities but that’s a pretty expansive group of items)
595 2018-07-28 18:25:17 And since there has been a competitive market there has been capitalism. Which has existed since we first traded commodities. These are owned by private individuals. The very definition of capitalism: tell my a time when this didn’t happen.
596 2018-07-28 18:20:10 Gold chart and #bitcoin chart r basically  same chart for months now I wonder how many ppl in crypto realize this and/or even look at regular stocks ETFs commodities etc.....
597 2018-07-28 18:10:51 Notice: Startup hiring chemists & engineers to develop hemp based, biodegradable drinking device with time released delivery mechanism for immediate distribution in California. Compensation: Negotiable and payable in cash or commodities of your choice.
598 2018-07-28 17:48:05 eek!!  go to EM and commodities to make it out the other side? what's the likelihood? how/when will we know if the Fed will accommodate?
599 2018-07-28 17:43:22 The hottest commodities in @WWAWrestle will not be paying any unreasonable fines.
600 2018-07-28 17:41:59 Poverty is an excuse! I grew up poor, single parent , eating commodities and using food stamps. Now, I have a college degree, a house plus two rent houses. But wait, first your excuse was your parents hated each other.
601 2018-07-28 17:41:39 Possibly, but there are a lot of uncontrollable variables. The launch of a new platform can double your value, and a decision by Visa to ban your niche can make your content worthless. It’s not like other commodities where you can set a range based on past market performance.
602 2018-07-28 17:34:12 thx @charliebilello For the next ten years, short QQQ, buy commodities? #BakesTakes_
603 2018-07-28 17:31:47 Not surprising.  Trump like many other super rich guys look at women as commodities.
604 2018-07-28 17:30:20 What prejudices and against whom? I certainly have none against you or any woman working in this or any other aspect of the sex industry. The only people I have an issue with are the men who buy and sell women as commodities.
605 2018-07-28 17:22:57 Hello mate. May I ask you a question on your day off? I am in the UK, so I have access to trade options on the major indicies/currencies/commodities only. Would I need access to individual stock options to warrant subscribing to your service? Cheers
606 2018-07-28 17:21:14 And high inflation is a meaningless attribute If property inflates its worthless until you actually sell said property. A line on your asset sheet is useless until sold and cash is realized. Inflation in commodities aren't going to help on a sales point as the cost of creating1/2
607 2018-07-28 17:12:11 Alex now you've done it. Shapes are trading on the commodities market now.
608 2018-07-28 17:00:04 That's great if you're invested in the stock market. For most of us who are affected by rising prices of basic commodities, healthcare and general cost of living, economic growth doesn't mean you'll be getting a raise. If you're thrilled too you need to check you're bank acct.
609 2018-07-28 16:53:16 Wow all of which were way higher than 4.2%! I heard today that approximately 1% of this quarters growth was the result of China trying to buy a lot of commodities before the tariffs kicked in.
610 2018-07-28 16:50:48 DJT didn't say "4% for the year" they said "on-track for 4% for the year"; two very different statements. Not an economist, am a financial analyst (or was)...we won't see any kick outside commodities for well over a year, that is do to hedging. I suspect not at all...

613 2018-07-28 16:37:47 I know!  Obama never started a trade war with China causing them to stop buying our soybeans & other commodities, then acted as the savior to the farmers by signing a bailout bill of $12B to rectify a problem that he, himself caused. Yep, he’s doing more! #DrainTheTrumpCesspool
614 2018-07-28 16:36:38 @GlobalProTrader looks like this would be a good fund post crash as it will have a blend of PM’s and commodities.  Do you like VGPMX?
615 2018-07-28 16:31:09 Amazing how much the Asian and Japanese market sways the overall sales numbers. Helps  being well known Japanese commodities I suppose. #ToEachTheirOwn #HappyGaming
616 2018-07-28 16:31:04 Relação de commodities e ibov também me parece importante. @hbredda mostra alguns pontos de vistas bem interessantes sobre o ciclo de commodities.
617 2018-07-28 16:21:41 Your argument that capitalism and slavery aren’t linked is terrible. You said that one pre dates the other when capitalism has been around for as long as we have traded commodities
618 2018-07-28 16:19:10 I do not see what more "nuance" there is for turning women into commodities. The sex-positive movement is so eurocentric it hurts.
619 2018-07-28 16:14:17 Ummmm because that’s how commodities markets work?
620 2018-07-28 16:14:07 For what commodities? I don’t think there is much steel in toothpaste.

622 2018-07-28 15:55:26 Yeah! they'll say, But that's like only a percentage of your gross.

Once we allowed all of our real&actual purchase prices to become as easy to access as we did, we were done.  When you're the only 'med profession' that deals solely in commodities--not services--you're fcked.
623 2018-07-28 15:47:56 Chile el gran ejemplo de estabilidad de Latinoamérica ahora le bajan calificación por la  "dependencia de los commodities" y una economía "poco diversificada". y recomienda una política fiscal "agresiva".
624 2018-07-28 15:46:44 When is the timing right for Farmers? Forty years of living in ND and I've  heard the same thing every year! There is a much bigger force at work. Food commodities should have NEVER been allowed on #WallStreet to be traded. There's the problem @FoxNews #foxnews @TeamCavuto
625 2018-07-28 15:36:48 Buhari took 3 months to appoint his Chief of Staff, 6 months to appoint a cabinet & 23 months/more to appoint heads of agencies & board members, E was so eager 2 fire upon his assumptn in2 office & rose import duties on basic commodities.

626 2018-07-28 15:36:03 And of course men who see women as commodities they can buy never cross those boundaries do they? Prostitutes are never raped, beaten, sodomised and murdered like other women because money has changed hands so those boundaries are respected.
627 2018-07-28 15:22:55 The players are literally seen as property, disposal commodities. Listen to the way sports fans and talking heads refer to them.
628 2018-07-28 15:22:44 @ImranKhanPTI 
Congrats Sir for being the PM of Pakistan. To save both countries you should allow the trade between two countries to curb the high cost of common commodities used by common people of both the countries. Hope you will become a friendly PM.
629 2018-07-28 15:18:11 Find a remedy to curb price hike on consumers products rather than demand a hike on wages. The more you hike wages the more the prices of commodities goes up. The cost of living has been going up in stages over the decades is because of increase in wage
630 2018-07-28 15:10:05 “Opinions are the cheapest commodities on earth. Everyone has a flock of opinions ready to be wished upon anyone who will accept them. If you are influenced by “opinions” when you reach DECISIONS, you will not succeed in any undertaking.” - Napoleon Hill
631 2018-07-28 15:10:01 3/3 State and local workers sharing private contractors/commodities to pave a state highway at the same time as a local road could make the cost more efficient for both because the procurement was done by same person/group. Radical idea indeed!
632 2018-07-28 15:03:00 I saw exactly 2 promising high tech products and 48 commodities. Bow ties, cowboy hats, and moon pies made in the USA while the innovative new products for biotechnology, aeronautics, and engineering have to be imported from Europe, Japan, China etc. 
633 2018-07-28 15:01:16 Buy low sell high. One can use foreign exchange. There are many ways to buy and sell. Some commodities on board ships can be rerouted with the buyer selling somewhere else.
634 2018-07-28 14:53:29 Drugs do not relax you, they reinforce your violent addiction to capitalist commodities.
635 2018-07-28 14:43:34 What do people in America, Australia,Switzerland, do for medicine or anywhere other than the EU? these remain scare tactics get more ludicrous by the day, the EU hasn’t an exclusive licence on medication or medical equipment, there are many alternative sources for all commodities
636 2018-07-28 14:41:44 Did you know, the "My Account" page allows you to easily track your orders against grants, budgets, commodities, labs, professors, etc.
637 2018-07-28 14:41:31 So in the end his one thing is either going to be ruined by monopolies in some provinces, bi-law in another’s and run properly in a couple. Like liquor we will likely not be able to by across Canada because we don’t even have free trade across our provinces for some commodities.
638 2018-07-28 14:32:21 Who and how ‘normal’ they are is irrelevant. Women are not commodities to be bought and sold for men’s sexual gratification. Sex is not a human right. I have a problem with any man who thinks they have a right to women’s bodies.
639 2018-07-28 14:22:49 Better? Are we talking about 2nd, 3rd World Countries also? Modern necessities rare commodities in some places.
640 2018-07-28 14:17:46 Tal cual. O te buscas un trader confiable en esos commodities, pones tu dinero, cada quien cobra lo suyo y ya. Así, sin tanto gamelote ni un gobierno mirando por encima de tu hombre para ver qué haces o dejas de hacer, para que en cuanto te descuides te roba; ni lo dudes.
641 2018-07-28 14:14:15 While this is not great we really need to think about food mileage and in truth a lot of NZ exports is that...OZ what commodities ?!
642 2018-07-28 14:06:13 And what about the prices of essential commodities for which the prices must fall due to reduced distance!
643 2018-07-28 14:02:57 Nowadays in business these indian owned industries are not even purchasing commodities from Kenyan traders. They only purchase from their own kind. indians only. 

Industries like bidco, menengai oil, timsales, raiply, kabras, spin knit, rai cement etc.
644 2018-07-28 14:01:14 @MarcoLavagna como se hace para poner plata en el bolsillo de la gente y al mismo tiempo bajar el deficit. En el 2002 estábamos  al 5 subs. 50% de pobres. Luego peso dev y un contexto int’l muy favorable con tasas bajas y commodities altas. Entonces 
645 2018-07-28 13:58:23 If they tell u that commodities are expensive now, ask them how much was garri, petrol, bread and other commodities. How viable was aviation, education, health, crime before 1999 and from 1999-2015. I can categorically say that baba don try considering the little available

648 2018-07-28 13:49:01 The riots were in the developing world, but the price spike in commodities was global.
649 2018-07-28 13:42:11 ‘Dominic Frisby is MoneyWeek’s commentator on gold and commodities - and is a private investor, focusing on junior mining companies.’ 
650 2018-07-28 13:33:56 But it was $2.40 when OBAMA left office. Remember that, too?

Or are you playing games w/reality to make racism seem like an OK price to pay at the pump? Hmm?

Expect to pay more if Putin has his way. Gasoline is one of his few commodities, besides hookers and nuclear weapons.
651 2018-07-28 13:28:52 Only thing these NSEL.bogus handles are famous is for tweeting lies.
Their King Pin is master at it. Lied to FMC about godowns and commodities inside them.

655 2018-07-28 12:58:12 Oh right, you mean I should look up how he created a ponzi scheme and was jailed for it? "Armstrong admitted to deceiving corporate investors and improperly commingling client funds in a case that prosecutors said resulted in commodities losses of more than $700 million"
656 2018-07-28 12:52:32 The only reason it’s up now is China preordered commodities and now that the tariffs have hit the 3rd quarter will suck. AND don’t you just wanna punch don jr?
657 2018-07-28 12:52:31 CBIC/Govt. has not made any efforts for publishing periodwise rate of GST on various commodities leading to many inconveniences to businessman.
658 2018-07-28 12:51:13 So banks have turned to business centers soon it will be phones for sale or food commodities...

660 2018-07-28 12:26:21 Used to think this was just a giant aberration. Now I know that it's intentional & just like they figured out how to rig the bond market w zirp they are using same game plan on commodities.

662 2018-07-28 12:07:09 I’m assuming you are gloating that trump announced above 4% growth? There was a massive front running of sales, esp farm commodities, to avoid the tariffs. With that in mind, and the #taxscam the numbers aren’t great. It’s not sustainable. His policies will wreck the economy.
663 2018-07-28 12:06:21 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.
664 2018-07-28 12:04:03 You guys keep repeating this dummy sold to you by this party of killers. What's the near oblivion? You bought fuel @N87/litre during PDP admin, naira was exchanged @N150/$1, economy was doing so well, cost of commodities was far cheaper.. Where's the near oblivion? LIARS!
665 2018-07-28 12:03:02 No one said they did.   Reading is fundamental.  Try commodities 101
666 2018-07-28 11:58:35 If everything is so good, why is the national debt accelerating? Why do we have to provide welfare to the farmers? Why haven’t wages risen? Why is the cost of commodities going up?
667 2018-07-28 11:54:40 Price of every commodities are in control now a days and it'll come down in coming days due to GST. Complete reform in our system in all sector is much needed, which Modi Govt is doing silently and now we are seeing the result.
668 2018-07-28 11:49:21 Importation again..... Are they commodities??? 
669 2018-07-28 11:45:56 Same thing as investment banks/broker-dealers pumping a stock to clients and also acting as principal/agent for the trade.  This is why securities/commodities  regulation is inevitable in sports speculation markets  @CFTC @SEC_News @FINRA
670 2018-07-28 11:43:46 Controlar preço de energia n está ao alcance dele. Se oil for p 150/200 dol, n tem oq ele fz. Matriz energética ainda é mega dependente de oil, e eh bastante provável q commodities ainda subam muito, dado q estamos no 3o ano do ciclo d alta (historicamente duram entre 5 e 8 anos)
671 2018-07-28 11:09:49 As if the government are the ones fixing the price of commodities in the market? Can you compare the price of commodities as of 1999 to 2007 or 20014? No. Because PDP has failed us and APC has deceived us. Just stop this comparison BS. Non stands for the common man.

683 2018-07-28 10:20:29 This should not be happening in the USA.  The current GOP sees everything, including government, as a business for personal enrichment where people, including children, are just commodities. Government should be public service and accountable to its citizens.
684 2018-07-28 10:09:28 For the current GOP everything, including government, is a business for personal enrichment. People are just commodities, even little children who can be ripped away from their parents so that GOP donors in the private prison business can make money. Disgraceful, immoral, corrupt

694 2018-07-28 08:56:32 No, quite frankly the rise in people's identity deriving from marketable commodities hasn't done this nation any favors in any area. It's more important to maintain production capabilities and the ability to independently supply true necessities.

704 2018-07-28 07:21:05 swings never cared abt wanna one they just see the members as commodities i mean. with this kind of complacency & the increase of both sasaeng activity and its gravity. name a worse management
705 2018-07-28 06:59:18 Is letting job's family to be killed for a bet an act of an entity with superior morals

How is giving you new kids the fix for killing the others

Kids are not commodities well except to god
706 2018-07-28 06:47:14 Wow.. this is why he is single.. treating women as commodities to be appraised by him. His standards. His wishes. Out of the blue. And still don't understand why you won't accept his"compliment". Total failure. I'm shocked by not surprised, sadly.
707 2018-07-28 06:44:46 that literally happens with uneaten food at restaurants, luxury bags, and other commodities
708 2018-07-28 06:41:19 Long time! Very long list indeed. The general commodities list is even longer!
709 2018-07-28 06:23:34 One so called celeb keeps complaining about the Problems in India. Keeps on highlighting all negative things about India. Keeps reminding that he is a tax payer.Often compares India with lifestyle of developed countries. He also complains on price hike on commodities etc.
710 2018-07-28 06:02:59 Both of those will take at least 2 years at 4% to become a significant enough issue to affect the general public. Why is that, you ask? One word hedging, which is common practice. Commodities are where you will see first signs of strain...those will start rising in 2 or 3 Q at 4%
711 2018-07-28 05:57:38 Tariffs (in southern ports only) paid for up to 80% of all Federal Income. Collected in the south and spent by northern politicians for their infrastructure. They had a good “scheme” going. TA slave trade/cheaper raw commodities/southern tariffs. A Trifecta Scam!
712 2018-07-28 05:29:05 Mapa da crise.
Do fim dos anos 90 até o início de 2012 houve um aumento significativo no preço das commodities no mercado internacional, impulsionado pela crescente demanda chinesa. Tenha-se em mente que o Brasil 
dependente da exportação de matérias-primas e produtos agrícolas.
713 2018-07-28 05:13:27 Coming from someone who is from Saudi Arabia and where wives are treated like commodities, I’m not suprised by your dumb statement
714 2018-07-28 05:04:30 @PMOIndia GST on petroleum products would certainly help common man n if state gov't agree 2 apply that then it would be great relief on all d commodities..
715 2018-07-28 04:52:45 @MEAIndia with the education and health industry, I wish the production and exchange of commodities flourish between the nations and their economic status get better!
716 2018-07-28 04:43:43 Proven commodities are always a game away from falling apart. That’s a myth.  A construct.

719 2018-07-28 04:27:26 The TITA Project is all about building a decentralised ecosystem powered by Blockchain technology for the buying and selling of locally or globally traded commodities and finished goods thereby setting up pedestals that enhance the financial systems. #TITA #TITAProject
720 2018-07-28 04:17:01 Proven commodities >> A-ball 19 year olds
721 2018-07-28 04:14:11 You know this isn’t the whole picture. Some of that growth is attributable to countries buying up commodities like soybeans in anticipation of tariffs imposed by Trump. Those purchases won’t be repeated and farmers won’t expand now because they can’t sell what they have.
722 2018-07-28 04:12:23 This is good sir, first you have implemented tax and now you are starting curtail or abolish them.
    You should clarify it that why your Govt. kept the basic commodities in the 18% slab. Is it in the welfare of the people of India?
723 2018-07-28 03:48:58 If we could have a DAO that allocated rare earth elements (commodities) and food accordingly, we could provide so much more to every human being on the planet. 
Provide more, with less! #efficiency
724 2018-07-28 03:34:38 Fiddlesticks Steve, I'm a commodities sales agent not a landscaping worker!
725 2018-07-28 03:15:14 Hello! My name is Bill Rancic. You killed my commodities sales agent. Prepare to die.

727 2018-07-28 03:10:57 Commodities não energética ( nao vai ser petróleo que causara a merda, eles estão quase autossuficientes com shale gas) .... vai ser o iron,soybeans,corn... puxando o féretro
728 2018-07-28 03:07:26 Sir but the ground reality is something different 
Prices of essential commodities are very costly compared to previous govt
729 2018-07-28 03:06:52 Ciclos de commodities metalicas e agricolas (soja e milho) retornarem a media ... , aumentao custo e baixa produtividade deles...
730 2018-07-28 02:55:03 Dear fellow citizens, the usual politics of fear and manipulation in back! No gas supply at Thimphu motithang BoD. Deprivation of essential commodities to the people. @lekeydorji @KuenselOnline

732 2018-07-28 02:28:53 All economists that I have heard talking about this say it is good, but a lot is due to “bulking up” on commodities before tariffs go into effect.  And that long-term growth is measured on an annualized basis.
733 2018-07-28 02:11:18 Yes, I understand the Commodities Market fairly well...if they need them from us...to provide to the Chinese...better deals could be negotiated. (need is the operative word)

Again, not a fan of the approach, but since Congress is sitting this out...I hope you are wrong.
734 2018-07-28 02:04:04 That is a great point. Even if they were totally self-supportive (which they are) , they couldn’t make international “money” without exporting valuable commodities through an intermediary. Diamonds, gold, platinum? Technology patents from citizens living outside of the country
735 2018-07-28 02:00:31 i keep falling asleep to podcasts of lectures of Das Kapital and then missing HUGE parts of the book and analysis / but then also,,, I had a whole dream last night abt commodities
736 2018-07-28 01:52:09 Fonterra doesn’t set the price - that’s the downside of selling commodities in a global market: we’re price-takers, not makers.
737 2018-07-28 01:35:50 Thanks 45 for giving China and other countries reason for panic buying on commodities, running up GDP to false numbers before your tariffs hit and kill it off.
Farmers can't stop talking about you.
738 2018-07-28 01:35:17 Obviamente veremos como se va dando todooo, xq obviamente hay muchas variables q se van sumando al analisis, espec estado en $Commodities y ppalmente reaccion en monedas el 1 ero d Ago c Fed $Decision y nivel d $ORO semana prox tbn.
739 2018-07-28 01:24:30 No, thank you. I'm Black, and I thank God for it, but I hate it when privileged, detached white women try to use me and my people as commodities or intellectual property.
740 2018-07-28 01:24:22 Trade in goods and commodities within the EU's area of control,drives up prices. Competition is limited due to the protective costs required to meet EU regulations. Small businesses can't afford those costs. A truly free UK will give UK businesses the opportunities they need.
741 2018-07-28 01:20:41 No no, we aren’t commodities
742 2018-07-28 01:18:26 poor have a choice to get their food at a grocery store and not tip. All poor people shopuld have a choice to buy the commodities they need at the best price without greasing someones palm for the privilege. The service you pay for is convenience. I cant afford convenience.
743 2018-07-28 01:11:34 Yea everybody is so rich, but poor people should have a way to obtain the commodities they need, the same as any other commodity, just like at the grocery store. the poor shouldnt be deprived because they wish to refrain from greasing the palms of the poeople richer
744 2018-07-28 00:59:09 What about decisions made on the commodities market. That’s what it boils down to isn’t it? The price of corn. The price of wheat. The price of beans. Who sets that price? Buyers,of course, who can go elsewhere if the price is too high. Something is out of wack.
745 2018-07-28 00:52:40 When commodities start slowing down. Your numbers will tank. Tariffs you enacted will tank this number
746 2018-07-28 00:48:38 मुझे हिमाचल प्रदेश के ट्रक यूनियन के प्रधान और उनकी टीम के सभी ट्रक ऑपरेटर भाइयों का हार्दिक धन्यवाद प्रदेश सरकार की ओर से करना है कि उन्होंने हड़ताल के दिनों में सभी essential commodities को ज़ारी रखा।और बहुत शांतिप्रिय तरीके से अपना आंदोलन किया ।
747 2018-07-28 00:38:46 Priorizar venda de commodities enfraquece economia brasileira. Não existe pais rico sendo celeiro do mundo! Temos que investir em tecnologia. #jornaldacultura
748 2018-07-28 00:35:26 This led to successive USD defaults and Venezuela being shut out of capital markets, leading it to 2016 when US monetary policy began tightening, reducing global $ based demand for commodities and the availability of credit.

750 2018-07-28 00:31:06 Hope we can freely trade our commodities thru your grain business & others in ‘18-‘19!
751 2018-07-28 00:21:01 It’s all down to the stealth of neoliberalism; everyone must contribute and sadly our society is in a place where our most vulnerable are sold as commodities. No more so than the independent sector that provides mental health beds for the NHS
752 2018-07-28 00:17:15 i dont believe in tipping for commodities. Its only for when i could have done the work myself but chose to have someone else do it. people choose to eat in a restaurant instead of packing their own lunch so they tip. I choose to pack my own lunch
753 2018-07-28 00:11:25 Why isn’t anyone questioning the Jays miss management of their assets into worthless commodities. They chose to wait to make moves.The last 2+ years have been a disaster. They had multiple superstars they let go for nothing or waited too long until they were worthless. Shatkins
754 2018-07-28 00:02:53 Dont be fooled by the 4.2% rise in GDP. Most of this is due to stock buy-backs from large corps. after their tax break AND that China and other countries have bought a lot commodities like soy beans to stock pile for the incoming trade war. Next report will be dire.
755 2018-07-28 00:00:24 Water is one of most precious commodities for now let’s just say help is on the way. Put a dehumidifier in the same room as your mining rig and see how much water you create daily through condensation. Try it and tell the world.
