45 2018-06-14 23:41:22 Probably has to do with the fact that markets are mostly flat, the only stocks allowed to trade higher are ones that have already returned 300% better in last 5 years.

48 2018-06-14 23:39:44 The Euro plunged more than two big figures from above 1.1800 to below 1.1600. European stocks surged, but the relatively stronger US dollar weighed on commodities and brought a more muted reaction from US investors @MicMcCarthy_CMC

54 2018-06-14 23:33:15 The thing is m8 that I’m not even saying it’s directed at me, it’s just when I scroll down the main Twitter feed all I see is arguing and squabbling and it puts you off reading anymore tweets or posting yourself. It would be just nice if we could get back 2 talking stocks again !
55 2018-06-14 23:32:54 I think you watch different TV shows than I do. I agree that we need to do more to improve housing stocks and make sure people have homes, but I don't think splitting the state is the way to do it.
56 2018-06-14 23:32:50 I just RTd a thread that went through those stocks. It includes great names like $SEAS and $DRYS.
57 2018-06-14 23:28:26 tanks.. I don’t think Russia will ever actually run out of them, for that I wouldn’t count on it, they have on duty more than China and US have combined with all their stocks and spare parts...

59 2018-06-14 23:27:59 According to Goldman Sachs, Japanese #stocks and #FIFA ranking of Japan are negetively correlated. When #Japan was in 13th place in 2011, #Nikkei 225 was less than 10,000 yen while it is currently above 22,000 as Japan placed in 61th.
Data indicates the proper place is 49th.

61 2018-06-14 23:25:53 Piles of cash will flow into US, they will buy stocks until dark clouds fill economic skies and everything falls apart! 2001, 2008...
62 2018-06-14 23:25:18 Awesome video! I had no idea NASDAQ touched an all-time intraday high & Russell 2000 finished with an all-time closing price high. Media stocks remained hot in US. Utilities were largely up & Financials were largely down due to falling interest rates.UR trade idea $TPX SPV!
63 2018-06-14 23:25:07 good session for it stocks eg hexaware as dollar is strong markets may tend to sideways with positive bais . (2/2)

65 2018-06-14 23:23:28 Bump stocks weren't legalized by anyone. They just existed. Stop blaming Democrats for everything.
66 2018-06-14 23:22:18 Yeah mate I’m getting that way lately. I’ve bought stuff and not even tweeted about it coz the Twitter Police  will be all over it. I tweet about the vast majority of stocks I buy but U know when U buy something a little high risk it’s best 2 just keep quiet about it I think.
67 2018-06-14 23:22:09 Holding $uAL since $45 in my portfolio and I don’t think there is any other name in this sector better then this !!!

69 2018-06-14 23:19:50 Less shares of higher priced stocks is fine.  All relative.  Started one account with 1 $AMZN for $600.   Now $1700.  Acct grew trading it on way up.  Good names with solid technicals are key.  Just a lesson I learned and appreciate.  Good luck!

99 2018-06-14 23:04:49 Mj, people try to pick their stocks and play the market hoping to get wildly rich.  They think they know what they're doing because they get good returns, but the reality is the entire market trends up and few get aboveaverage returns. You are better off with a mutual fund.

115 2018-06-14 22:50:16 Why haven't you banned bump stocks and raised the age to purchase a firearm to 21 like you said you were going to do? Are you afraid of the NRA?
116 2018-06-14 22:49:45 The Feds would try to deflect the blame to others. However it is the Federal Gov’t with ultimate responsibility for managing fish stocks. Sure would be interesting reading of those Ministerial briefing notes. You need to know where the bones are buried.
117 2018-06-14 22:49:25 Yes he exaggerates, however getting the remains back is a big deal, getting 3 hostages back is a big deal. But instead you focus on an exaggeration-pathetic

122 2018-06-14 22:41:05 Paying mind to anything about Seals. It amazes me that some Inshore Harvesters have not began  legal action (yet) against the Feds for negligence and mismanagement of the Fish stocks and the damages caused. Some legal beagle would feast on that.
123 2018-06-14 22:40:36 All this ice on me, like I won the lottery, shorty eyeing me like she got some stocks on me.

150 2018-06-14 22:17:14 If there was ever a reason to reintroduce old-fashioned stocks and skips full of rotten fruit for the passing punters to toss at the restrained, this is it. If eagles were a problem (and they're not), there are multiple management options that don't include poisoned baits.

163 2018-06-14 22:09:40 I trade mostly high priced stocks . But will buy low priced if it has momentum.
164 2018-06-14 22:08:44 Final bit on software stocks...

The ev/rev multiples folks are paying will remain insane as long as most in the group continue to deliver 30-45% Q YoY rev growth. And as long as investors are willing to ignore everything aside from sales (subscription) growth.

178 2018-06-14 22:01:25 Ha! This will result in a total loss of jobs for everyone else whose income is supplemented by our wild salmon. The disease from farmed salmon will decimate our wild stocks. There are ZERO success stories when it comes to farmed salmon. Do your research.
179 2018-06-14 22:01:22 Sorry to hear that, bro. Preserve your capital and going forward never short the market's favorite stocks.

190 2018-06-14 21:58:11 With respect..the big issue is people are looking at this like a stock. It's not. Stocks can split. This can't but can fork. If you are a by the book trader this is obviously not for you. These coins are decentralized like the internet. imag If net was a
191 2018-06-14 21:58:03 One thing seems to be lost...stocks will peak on great news just as stocks bottomed in despair/depression and lost hope!  Its euphoric and stupid again...Mint coin but dance by the door
192 2018-06-14 21:57:57 you very quickly get into exotic chemistries to get things to stick/not stick or be permeable to wrong things. It's not impossible, but you end up having to design whole new metabolic chains, artificial transport in the blood, and exotic feed stocks.
193 2018-06-14 21:57:43 I drift off work on my Guyver technology, come back my Platinum Station. Learn something about space tech, then invest in stocks & play why not in no hurry.
194 2018-06-14 21:57:26 This is actually so true. Neutral doesn't matter if you can't even combo for shit or kill characters/take stocks.

196 2018-06-14 21:54:39 Be specific, what mess? Stocks  rose steadily every year. Housing prices, up. Unemployment went down month by month. Foreign respect for the US was up. What exactly was failing?

198 2018-06-14 21:53:35 I live in NJ and regardless of the tougher gun laws, I know people who have AR-15s, bump stocks and high-capacity magazines with armor piercing bullets. They're still very easily accessible in other states.
199 2018-06-14 21:53:00 If money is speech, as SCOTUS says... Where does gambling fit in? Shouldn't I be allowed to voice my opinion on next roll of the dice, turn of the cards or valuation of stocks? The more laws they make to restrict our freedoms, the less sense they make & more conflicts with logic.
200 2018-06-14 21:52:54 Im planning to stop gaming for a while & just go for stocks & poker play maybe. Something w/ currency, but still because it's such minor flakes return.

203 2018-06-14 21:51:51 Oh shit, their stocks plunged too?

And this is true, after what Microsoft did, they are treating their customers better. Cause they eventually learned.

208 2018-06-14 21:47:12 You must be ignorant to how it works. Many companies give stock to employees. Then company buys back stock from market. Limiting number of stocks makes them more valuable. Employees gain. Know your economics dude
209 2018-06-14 21:46:31 Time to buy some stocks then.
210 2018-06-14 21:45:03 If you have stocks you would be celebrating smarty.. so you understand how it works??

217 2018-06-14 21:38:36 Ha, I’m sure there is a bit of that. But also focusing on those stocks which cannot be produced at short notice? And those which we would want a lot of at the start of a conflict but don’t regularly use in peacetime?

Though apparently stocks plunged after E3 so yeah
220 2018-06-14 21:38:14 Remember, McTurtle holds stocks in private prison companies. Maybe that's why he sticks with Trump.

222 2018-06-14 21:36:44 If you can find somewhere that stocks it, Halsron Heritage is pretty awesome. They do some great metallic slinky numbers. I wore one for my wedding in a field - gold Grecian faux wrap floor length. Great fun to wear...
223 2018-06-14 21:36:42 Yeah, there's too much compassion around. Stocks of sympathy may run low.
224 2018-06-14 21:36:15 Need to get back into stocks tbh

235 2018-06-14 21:32:25 I've believed resurrecting the public stocks for politicians and government bureaucrats should be considered.  Open to be pelted by abused citizens with rotten fruits and vegetables.

(Okay, unusual in contemporary context, but, in my opinion, probably not really cruel enough.)

I have 8 weeks left in school
238 2018-06-14 21:31:19 Been following you for a minute now... let’s say you buy some $aagc around .003 or less ... what do you personally sell at? Is it always different? I’m new to stocks under .01
239 2018-06-14 21:30:32 UN and all the think tanks must have something. Or everybody has given up ?

241 2018-06-14 21:29:57 A lot of these Chinese companies have been proven to be frauds (Carsons past work alone proves it). Not sure about $BABA but Chanos certainly thought so. $TAL looks like straight garbage and earnings manipulation would explain the stocks 30x returns in 6 years.

243 2018-06-14 21:29:11 Supply will quickly dry up as most tokens will be locked causing price hikes and demand will rear its head once daily dividends are being accumulated.

244 2018-06-14 21:28:47 Dude, at MoMo this year I was in Pools with M2K and managed to take 2 stocks each game, and went last stock on netplay with ARookie. It’s coming together.
245 2018-06-14 21:28:44 All makes sense to me except $tsla as no one knows the real picture
246 2018-06-14 21:28:18 Wage growth still flat bc corporate greed hasn’t changed.  You made it worse bc they will buy back stocks to make their options worth more and still get tax breaks. Way to make the worker even less important.
247 2018-06-14 21:28:10 For the love of god please start Smash 6's lifespan with like 4 stocks and work down again if it's too long

Don't just stay at 2 and potentially work up
248 2018-06-14 21:27:40 You said on stocks earning so little, not on how they earn them. FB is an obvious odd man out there....the others I at least get your point. (Don’t agree but get)

253 2018-06-14 21:25:49 Stick to buying stocks from long bases with VCP characteristics. You will get bigger moves and less chance of getting stopped vs. the smaller extended bases.
254 2018-06-14 21:24:05 Tech stocks due for somewhat of a pullback or consolidation IMO

259 2018-06-14 21:18:28 Nintendo's stocks fell like 7% after E3 because investors have no idea what they're doing. Aha.

262 2018-06-14 21:14:01 Losses in trading are inevitable. How you handle them determines your success as a trader. Is it a predetermined loss? A controlled loss? or is it a portfolio fire? That is was separates the successful from the unsuccessful #Stocks #options #AAPL #SPY #ADBE
263 2018-06-14 21:13:29 YTD returns for the big #NDX stocks
$AMZN +45%
$MSFT +18%
$AAPL +11%
$GOOGL +8%
$FB +8.5%

$QQQ $NDX YTD return = +12%

So, unless I'm missing something, it seems to be all about $AMZN.  $AMZN holds the key  Oh and I left $NFLX out as its weight is paltry in comparison.

399 2018-06-14 20:08:21 Agree with your point, but just curious if market cap weighting (to top x names in an index) reduces the negative momentum outcome of owning companies that goes to 0. I wonder how many S&P 500 stocks (for example) jump to $0 while being a component of the index.

414 2018-06-14 20:02:07 FWIW, I would not be surprised in the least if $TLT starts following $DXY higher soon. Think curve flattening, flight out of EM, fin stocks trading on thin ice, etc. signal some serious potential credit market problems looming. Bonds likely "win" as safety play
415 2018-06-14 20:02:04 Unreal be nice to see crowds like that again but cant see it any time soon
416 2018-06-14 20:00:51 How management communicates mistakes is very important. No one is mistake-free - as investors 40% of the stocks we buy underperform the market - and I'd be concerned about any company where shareholder communication doesn't include a candid assessment of mistakes. -- Bill Nygren
417 2018-06-14 20:00:48 Huge isnt it! Im in there somewhere.

419 2018-06-14 19:59:15 España es algo rara. Mi mujer tenía la MD y sus primos la master. Seguramente porque había ambos stocks en ECI. Yo pasé de spectrum/atari 2600 a un 286 xt turbo y los sucesivos clones de 386 y 486. No me fijé en las consolas hasta el AMD k6: ps1, n64 etc. Antes eran los recre.
420 2018-06-14 19:59:08 Started a position in $YY today and $SOGO yesterday. From the chinese internet stocks that are so hot right now these + $IQ are my favourites.

424 2018-06-14 19:57:07 Why are recent Chinese IPO’s so hot right now? No one fucking knows. Why are oil stocks trading as if oil were at $30 a barrel? No one has a fucking clue. #marketsalwaysright #whoknows #whocares #putablindfoldonandthrowadartinanythingbutoilnames $SPY

 $tsla - $60 bill
$NFLX - $170 bill
$FB - $580 bill
$AMZN - $850 bill

And the rest of them. Never in 30 years I have ever seen mkt caps so high on so few stocks earning so little. The central banks have destroyed efficient capital
426 2018-06-14 19:56:36 Why do you not support fractions of cents, when many stocks will trade in those ranges? $0.01 is a 25% swing on a stock priced at $0.04.

429 2018-06-14 19:55:29 @NTLiveStream @SetUpStream - FWIW, the sell-off is all about (a) the S&P re-balance tomorrow and funds having to sell the stocks with the biggest buybacks, and (2) companies not being able to buy back stock in the last 10 min.  Wish it were more than that...

435 2018-06-14 19:51:33 Citron was on CNBC shorting 120 last year. then i believe earlier this year above 200...probably better to look for some fraud rather than short momo stocks.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

461 2018-06-14 19:33:28 That’s true for current fund’s of current stocks but past fund’s are an indicator of future expectations. So what may happen is you invest based on TA ignore FA. If the stock has low FA then the likelihood is future earnings are bad and the price goes down as you describe.

463 2018-06-14 19:31:59 Y'all are full of shit. Stocks drop all the time, but why would it be troubling for Nintendo all of a sudden? So we're just gonna ignore the fact that they haven't had a decline in a while to now say that all of a sudden they're doomed because their stocks dropped? Stupid!

474 2018-06-14 19:26:24 I know. I have only been running money for 30 yrs. Investments rise & fall over time. Stocks go up more than 8% on average over the past 100 yrs. ALL investments can and do decline. Are ALL investments "risky"???
475 2018-06-14 19:25:08 Just their teaser raised YG stocks I cannot believe he benched them for so long
476 2018-06-14 19:23:38 You don't seem to understand how the market works. Sometimes, for the foreseeable future at the time, stocks maintain a bear market. Therefore, when banks have investments in these markets, they lose a lot of money and often fail and need bailing out. Therefore they are risky.
477 2018-06-14 19:23:00 dude. I better sell my $RHT stocks if this is how people at @RedHatEMEA looks at it.

482 2018-06-14 19:22:08 Such fall mostly come with many negative news which makes one doubt about the potential and therefore refrain from investing in it. After sometime when the stock picks up again the same investor will again wait for another fall and the cycle repeats.

486 2018-06-14 19:19:08 The people they are buying it from get paid, so they can either cash out or invest in another company. People who hold on to stocks get more out of them as the price goes up, and people interested in buying stock see how much faith the company has in their own stock.

It was the best response I could give it the time. LOL
503 2018-06-14 19:12:20 It’s probably a bot, but we are doing better in most aspects in comparison to the past few decades(employment, stocks, etc.) Realistically, not everything is better than in the past though.

508 2018-06-14 19:09:56 Well that is the MAJOR part of the forecast right there. So stocks are right, bonds are wrong, in your view.

That seems awfully low...

What am I doing wrong? 

I guess there will be tax involved in selling stocks and stuff but, adding 20% to that is still $750k...

537 2018-06-14 18:55:59 Many don't realize the US already launched a universal basic income program. It is only for those wealthy enough to have a chunk of change in a brokerage account, and the vehicles providing the steady stream of capital are FAANG stocks 
538 2018-06-14 18:55:10 Stocks are the ONLY asset with a "permanent" tailwind. Over EVERY long-term period, they have gone up. What data support your claim that "stocks as a whole are inherently risky". That's just total nonsense.

543 2018-06-14 18:52:52 Find a SINGLE reputable economist or analyst who said banks investing in stocks were a cause of the financial crisis. Just one.
544 2018-06-14 18:51:25 Even if you are right I am not liking the risk/reward here. It's not worth the possible 12.8% you would make at this level. Given the momentum of the tech stocks, I don't think its likely that you see $340 anytime soon.
545 2018-06-14 18:51:22 Every time I look at my stocks going up I think "I should hit the casino real quick" and then realize I'm an idiot...smh

558 2018-06-14 18:47:49 hoping future companies start tokenizing there value rather than offer stocks to investors...i think the crypto market can become a new type of stock market once prices uncouple from btc. way more fun than buying stocks too.

572 2018-06-14 18:42:49 "Unnatural" euphoria: Read this thread and elsewhere to see greed and hence the feelings having taken over what should be objective decision making. This is irrational and adds to unnatural demand for stocks and #Uranium.
573 2018-06-14 18:42:27 Also I never said that investing in stocks that are inherently risky was the only part that banks played in causing the Depression, I'm just saying that that is the most important one, which is generally agreed upon by historians and economists.
574 2018-06-14 18:41:09 Tech stocks continue to rally. Nasdaq at another all-time high today. Right now we're at 7,752. Any chance we close at a record (and lucky?) 7,777.77?
575 2018-06-14 18:40:07 Fascinating note! Am I the only one worried by the potential implications of a purely market focused producer politicizing stocks to include price control?

583 2018-06-14 18:37:26 $DIA down .15%. My portfolio up 2.5%. This is not unusual. None of my stocks list on Dow. Dow is a poor measure of Market.
584 2018-06-14 18:36:57 It's not that the stocks were especially risky, it's that stocks as a whole are inherently risky. And therefore the govt allowing banks to put the money of hardworking people into stocks that are inherently risky is endangering the economy.
585 2018-06-14 18:36:08 I can't understand the stock market.  Why the not must to say before the buying stocks.  The fucker already making 9% on is buying! This ia bullshit! The fucker buy stocks amd direct FPC get upp 9%.. when tbe company still fingershit .

618 2018-06-14 18:21:33 Buried in the ATF's definition of a machine gun is why nothing has been done about bump stocks. The gun is still only a semi-auto firearm.

635 2018-06-14 18:15:39 His point was about the upside potential of economic value, not about how disruptive either would be. His point is that real property, stocks, real estate, etc. will always carry greater value as a whole than the currency which is used to price and transact those properties.

651 2018-06-14 18:06:07 The biggest difference is that overvaluation is not just confined to the tech sector (where today you could at least make the case that at least there is growth there) but across the board in US stocks, bonds, re, pe, etc.

684 2018-06-14 17:54:05 Despite the fact that the timer was the same as smash 4’s 2 stock ruleset, games were finished at a similar time to smash 4’s woth 3 stocks
685 2018-06-14 17:54:03 3 stocks because higher damage output for 1v1
686 2018-06-14 17:52:19 You buy and sell stocks. Bull crap! The President has the stocks going higher and higher. You should be  grateful!
687 2018-06-14 17:51:41 2 stocks was already too little for Smash 4, this should have 3 or 4. I still don't know why Melee has 4 if people are so damn stressed.
688 2018-06-14 17:50:49 3 stocks seems the way to go now the game looks more faster
689 2018-06-14 17:50:41 Nintendo NY was letting us to 3 stocks 6 min and the matches went smoothly. I can see it happening
690 2018-06-14 17:49:32 two stocks, timer as low as humanly possible, 3/5 by default and 4/7 once you get to top 32

gimme that ST bullshit
691 2018-06-14 17:48:15 If you're in anything but $PLFX then what are you doing?!?! INSANITY!

693 2018-06-14 17:47:49 laying on the couch while babe traded stocks and i’m so bored
694 2018-06-14 17:47:30 Yeah I guess 3 stocks would do just fine, so that way it won't feel too long due to the game pacing it too short.
695 2018-06-14 17:46:51 $CEOS looks like its gonna run FINALLY.  PLEASE RUN these guys arre good at running the Chit out of stocks.  I think they can get $CEOS to .30s i bet.  but now .03s.  someones loading it up.
696 2018-06-14 17:46:43 Yea fighting over 2 or 3 stocks for Smash 4 was soooo diplomatic right? 
697 2018-06-14 17:45:03 The game is a lot faster now so 3 stocks sound appropriate for future tournaments
698 2018-06-14 17:45:00 John,  all of that is already priced into the stocks. Nothing surprises Wall Street. Price action is the key over common available news.

702 2018-06-14 17:42:40 >> The momentum player should exercise patience in light of the dwindling list of issues yet to break out.

Do you mean waiting for solid new bases? I'm taking some profits on strength and most stocks are now extended for the new cash for what I can see...
703 2018-06-14 17:41:56 I'm feeling 3 stocks on this one but I wouldn't complain with 2. 4 is too much.
704 2018-06-14 17:41:50 $ bid through the roof tariffs coming and china WILL retaliate  stocks should have some giveback now...

706 2018-06-14 17:41:44 Getting notifications my stocks are increasing 
707 2018-06-14 17:41:30 That's what I'm trying to push for and by bump stocks I mean I grouped all gun accessories  under one label because the main thing is bump stocks. I dont want to get rid of all guns and people dont seem to want to understand that
708 2018-06-14 17:41:21 As of right now I feel that 3 stocks would be the most solid pick as 4 might be too much until we know more about how 'fast paced' the games will go, and 2 stock is too few especially if the game promotes more active gameplay.

710 2018-06-14 17:41:16 I expect one day for you to post a letter from a follower, asking if it's ok to cash in his/her entire 401(k) and put it in FAANG stocks...
711 2018-06-14 17:41:02 3 stocks seems appropriate after watching a ton of footage.
712 2018-06-14 17:40:40 i think 3 stock is better overall for smash ultimate, people will feel more confident with stocks to play with and be more aggresive/have more fun

2 stocks inherently makes u scared even at 0% first stock... ur so close to losing even at match start rofl
713 2018-06-14 17:40:37 Most think of me as a short term momentum/swing trader but what many don't know is members often pick my select stocks for their IRA account

nice job!
716 2018-06-14 17:40:07 I think Smash 5 needs to be 3-4 stocks. 2 stocks would make games end too quickly and 5 stocks is a bit excessive

823 2018-06-14 16:55:17 3/ Both the Great Recession and the great Depression followed attempts to increase participation of lower economic groups in key wealth-building assets.  Leveraged bets by "little people" on stocks led to 1929, on houses to 2008.  Yes, too simple, but it is a parallel.

846 2018-06-14 16:44:04 An absolutely correct observation. The add-on costs of restarting production are ALWAYS greater than maintaining sufficient stocks. It’s a mistake we repeat with monotonous regularity.

860 2018-06-14 16:36:29 So, I'm done for the day on stocks, bought a few shares of $DE, probably will sell tommorrow depending on chart. Sold my $OSTK for over a $200 gain and sold my $PVTL shares for about a $100 gain.  +$481 for the week
861 2018-06-14 16:36:16 Just like your $NVDA prediction ... Why do you always share negative.. You were right once with $VRX.. but failed so many times after that.. stop spreading negativity..
862 2018-06-14 16:35:08 I'm not really a trader, I just sell on either a high/mitigated upside potential (excluding my income stocks) so I don't mind holding because I really like IQ and think it still has exponential growth potential.

881 2018-06-14 16:26:38 Same. Sold most of my ASX stocks apart from APT,
PPH, AXL, CLV and a few others. I’m at least 70% in US stocks now, predominantly tech and emerging China names.

884 2018-06-14 16:25:59 When stocks correct sharply, it makes sense to revisit one’s own pecking order, review existing ideas, rank them afresh and then raise or reduce existing holdings. 

Often, we pick out winners within our Minnows. Or, call out minnows among what we thought were winners.

893 2018-06-14 16:22:59 They can damage America. Tax returns display business dealings, sometimes illegal ones. This can have an effect on the stock market by causing some stocks to plummet if investors feel like the country is in imminent chaos.
894 2018-06-14 16:22:46 Why so negative and scare people?  Earnings are huge.  Economy is great.  Stocks should go up.  What could be wrong?
895 2018-06-14 16:22:25 Trump and his kids stole money from his foundation. Why isn’t this a criminal offense? A person who sells their OWN stocks based on a tip can go to jail and these crooks will get off with a fine?

898 2018-06-14 16:21:57 With volatile stocks it's difficult to attempt short-term trades based on short-term charts. $TSLA is better viewed imo on 30 min, hourly, and 4 hour. Shorter term charts good for fine tuning entry/exit points AFTER decision to trade has already been made.

1071 2018-06-14 15:18:02 Corporations are using the tax relief windfall to buy back their own stocks, artificially raising the price of their stocks.  They won't be able to keep this up and when the stock markets falls, it's going to crash just like in 1929.
1072 2018-06-14 15:17:52 Would advise against going short on Pharma Stocks especially Sun Pharma, I see it touching 600 later this expiry. Last year's Sell on Rallies worked well, won't make it easy this time.

1078 2018-06-14 15:14:21 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?

Always, look at the bigger picture. Money many make, wealth very few. Look at your stocks and ask where will this company be in 10 years? Can I give my money to this management?

Ask for each of your smallcap stock - Can this become a largecap?

1340 2018-06-14 13:43:10 The church actually has several billion dollars in investments (stocks). I learned about it years ago at BYUID. They also have an investment firm that invests on behalf of wealthy members, called Deseret Trust Company, which works with LDS Philanthropies.

1377 2018-06-14 13:28:40 Token securities are a big thing. But they won’t need a separate chain. And as real security markets integrate into a bitcoin layer they will offer tokens aka stocks. NYSE didn’t create a new fiat just for stocks. They used the dollar.

1435 2018-06-14 13:00:09 Re new @coinbase Index Fund:

Unlike stocks/bonds, one money ultimately displaces the others (absent government imposing a money within its borders). Index investing in cryptocurrencies is basically throwing darts at a board where the targets are differently sized by market cap.

1442 2018-06-14 12:56:13 I guess my point was that 10% compounded in ok stocks is still pretty great over the long-term.  Indeed 8% compounded is still a good long-term result.  Buying the Unilever, Diageo type stocks can generate great long-term results.  The key is having no big disasters.

1455 2018-06-14 12:47:59 From what my understanding is,  any stock market gains is from companies buying back stocks after their tax cuts that were supposedly, with no mandates, to go to creating jobs and raising wages.  Plus, the stock market means zilch to half of adults.

1466 2018-06-14 12:42:27 No one really uses bump stocks. They are very uncommon, but if you start allowing the government to take away parts of the 2nd amendment the'll be no end. See how  socialism and registering/banning  firearms turned out for Nazi Germany?

As a house Motilal Oswal has issue, they want to cover all the performing stocks.
1483 2018-06-14 12:32:32 And for the record. I completely disagree with banks and firms “upgrading stocks” at all time highs. It’s just bullshit.

1486 2018-06-14 12:30:51 People bought bitcoin at ATH due to greed. The same greed that inflated prices in 2013, 2011, gold in 2011, tech stocks in 1999 and so on. Tether is being blamed just as banks were blamed for housing prices in 2008, but if people were not greedy there would be no bubble at all.

1492 2018-06-14 12:28:28 How to utilise market valuation?
1.Exit Over Valued stocks.
2.Exit shares without fundamental strength.
3.Keep 20-25% as Cash to utilise further corrections.
4.Pick under valued stocks.
5.Ignore news without impact on business of stock.

1504 2018-06-14 12:22:46 Yet, because I am optimistic about the economy, does not equate to a love of equities.  Stocks and the economy do not have to go in the same direction.

I think we have had a decade of Wall Street winning over Main Street.  That's about to change.  It might not mean higher stocks

1508 2018-06-14 12:20:02 I post a bit of blame on stocks. See a privately held company can make relatively the same profits every quarter and be fine, company is good. A publicly traded one does that, "it's not growing, sell the stocks". They'll do anything to see that number go green on a stock ticker.

1583 2018-06-14 11:32:56 It's fine as long as we retain our own massive water reserves (national disaster or war levels) make sure our stocks are at 110% before we sell bottled water in block and don't let greed drain national reserves.
1584 2018-06-14 11:32:46 How many of those 280 internet stocks are still on the market actively trading? How many of them managed to turn a profit?

1588 2018-06-14 11:31:39 All these CNBC guests come on and scream buy stocks and get to claim they know what they're talking about.  Yet they never properly explained in past reasons for growth...The real reason is bc they want more investors and, on average, the stock market goes up more years than down
1589 2018-06-14 11:30:39  ANNOUNCEMENT

1590 2018-06-14 11:30:10 So? 2 stocks is too little anyway... Non-neatural starts? Stages that lean ARE being used.
1591 2018-06-14 11:28:47 You guys are both right but stocks tend to drop further and faster than they go up so hit pieces usually pay off much quicker.
1592 2018-06-14 11:28:12 We can fish cod. It’s quotas are tighter. And there’s other stocks. You assume demand won’t change based on price. Cod is fairly inelastic, I grant you.

1622 2018-06-14 11:07:07 Woodford is a classic case of people following personalities rather than an investment process.  Looking at Woodford's disparate stocks and I can't see any evidence of a clear investment process.  He got a few sector bets right in his career but stock picking has been mixed.
1623 2018-06-14 11:07:04 Insane inflow into stocks. Speculative names like, i.e., $NTNX $EVBG $MDB go parabolic while the late comers form the right sides of their constructive bases, i.e. $APPN $FSCT. Moreover the big techs also go higher in tight trading action. Broad rally with extreme accumulation.

1634 2018-06-14 11:00:38 Just an observation - a lot of wedging action on many setups. Stocks hit new highs but without any real follow through and momentum. Past experience teaches me that this is a dangerous environment to buy aggressively. I'm stepping back for now.
1635 2018-06-14 11:00:22 Thanks, most see negative comments and think I'm a bear when indeed my argument remains the same, it's about timing and buying the stocks with a firm understanding.

3. Use the suffix .AX so searches are cleaner, no unrelated posts. Not applicable if symbol contains numbers

CBA -> $CBA.AX

1645 2018-06-14 10:53:37 True but they’ve been flashing for a while. Once the bond yield meets the S&P earnings yield there is little reason to hold stocks. Especially at the current valuation.

1787 2018-06-14 08:48:27 I know what I wrote. You cherrypicked one part out of context then formed your response to me based on that. In the context of gaming, which many of these writers have NO idea about stocks, having this weird minute by minute update of stocks is silly.

1790 2018-06-14 08:46:08 I think you might need to re read that post, friend. "Why are GAMING CHANNELS discussing stocks and stuff?" It didn't ask why gamers would care. That would be like Game Informer including stock info.
1791 2018-06-14 08:45:59 Yet all of that is still irrelevant to gaming as it doesn't affect games... and the writers add no real context or relevance to the subject matter cause they don't know anything about stocks.
1792 2018-06-14 08:45:06 Of course it is but ultimately also it is an option for his family to keep a fair wedge of influence over the fox brand, as they will still be in ownership to an extent, with a company like Disney, plus the intitial value of those stocks will instantly rise after completion.

1. I'm interested in hearing about it. It's an interesting topic. Why talk about a company's former presidents? It's just interesting & somewhat relevant
2. Anyone is a potential investor. Literally anyone over 18 (or 16?) Can buy stocks. It's easy
1796 2018-06-14 08:42:38 And stop trying to move the goalpost. You missed the POINT of my original post attempting to turn it into a basic general question of why are people talking about stocks. NO, that was not the point. It was within the GAMING space... bruh... you're not slick.

1799 2018-06-14 08:41:03 Nice cherrypick, mind including the REST of what I was talking about: "Why are gaming channels discussing stocks and stuff? Has ZERO effect on games." 
The context was in the "GAMING SPACE" smart guy. I KNOW why people discuss stocks in general.
1800 2018-06-14 08:39:19 The context is that the gaming community as a whole is talking about Nintendo's stocks at any minute change. These are not investors, literally any other gaming company's stocks do not interest them (or get talked about). THAT's why it's silly.

1804 2018-06-14 08:36:15 You: why are people talking about stocks?

1944 2018-06-14 06:37:35 Identification of poor stocks

First they trade either at 52 week low or little above it

As soon as marker correct
These stocks start falling by 5 or more percent

But when market rise they up only by 1 or 2 %

1951 2018-06-14 06:30:28 Global stocks are trading in negative territory today following the Federal Reserve’s decision to hike U.S. interest rates and increased the 2018 and 2019 inflation forecasts. The era of quantitative easing is now over but what does this mean for investors
1952 2018-06-14 06:30:02 Anyone can acquire the know-how for analyzing stocks.

1954 2018-06-14 06:29:54 basically this indicates faster global rates increase and it is not a positive for stocks in general.

before you go out there and make the wrong decisions, just remember that being too far ahead of your time is indistinguishable from being wrong.

1956 2018-06-14 06:29:45 Is there any part of you that grasps that you can't ban bump stocks, because they are easily the easiest thing to replicate?
1957 2018-06-14 06:27:11 Well said! The only difference is, they'll survive and be safer, and our economy is better, our stocks have been up, they'll likely have more opportunities for work, if they can learn the value of work that is. We are so much better off!
1958 2018-06-14 06:26:25 The market correction due to #FedHikesRates should be used as a buy on dips. Good opportunity to accumulate stocks. #SENSEX will again move up in a few days. Good time to accumulate #midcaps #FOMC #Nifty50 Historically fed rate hikes have been positive for Indian markets.
1959 2018-06-14 06:26:03 I may not have a firm reason to buy the stocks i do, but i surely have a strong reason for the stocks that I don't buy.

1973 2018-06-14 06:17:03 But he isn’t... Spike down in stocks especially after announcing big selling games is a shock to many of us. It’s just not making any sense while he is trying to provide information to help us make sense of it all.

2070 2018-06-14 04:52:19 When the NRA blocks all effort by the CDC to study gun violence, blocks restriction of bump stocks, or blocks all type of gun legislation, they are furthering the deaths of children.

Well regulated, as in regulation

2087 2018-06-14 04:38:13 When the Disney deal was originally announced they were paying $52 Billion in stocks & taking on over $13 billion of 21CF’s debt - I have yet to see this brought up. That would make the playing fields pretty damn even & I have always gotten the feeling the Murdoch’s want Disney.
2088 2018-06-14 04:36:57 Look I’m not for taking guns away i just want people to feel safer. Which the only way is to make new gun laws. If they take AR’s away who cares. Why do you need them? Just use a 12 gauge or pistol or a semi-auto and just ban bump stocks.

2097 2018-06-14 04:29:43 I was thinking something like this. I lost many stocks to seth today (in bracket and friendlies) due to failed techs so I think it's time for me to git gud.
2098 2018-06-14 04:29:05 Now, the tough time begins for stocks. We have to see the investor flows to stocks for the next few months as interest rate hardening cycle has started.
2099 2018-06-14 04:29:01 It is unbelievable that bump stocks and AR-15s are legal in the USA.   I support a law to make it a felony to attempt to acquire either.  All my bubba relatives will have the vapors, but there it is!
2100 2018-06-14 04:25:49 Fully automatic weapons are weapons of war, and as such are illegal for possession by the average citizen. Bump stocks are an accessory that makes an AR-15 fully automatic. When bump stock meets AR-15 it’s an illegal combination. Of course you knew that, didn’t you?
2101 2018-06-14 04:25:47 Roseanne you also  MAGA.........
Their the laughing stocks? All They Have Done This Past Week Is Use The F Word! Liberals Are Now Complete Failures.
2102 2018-06-14 04:22:21 To be honest I'd rather they spend money on rolling stocks if it means more frequent service and people spending less time waiting at the stations (and caring about it), but if they have the budget, I hope it goes ahead even if just for OKU access.
2103 2018-06-14 04:21:43 You mean like banning bump stocks, requiring domestic abusers to turn in their weapons to police, raising the purchasing age to 21?

Dropping is good but that doesn’t mean it has stopped, it didn’t stop for the Sandy Hook children, the Parkland kids, Pulse nightclub, or Las Vegas

2126 2018-06-14 03:59:34 1/2  Can you not give him a tad bit of credit for not running your economy to the ground. Obama came into office at a tough time, I agree but Trump’s created a great atmosphere for business, Stocks were at an all time high, unemployment at an all time.
2127 2018-06-14 03:57:02 So what’s your advice? My dad who’s old enough to access 401k but still working is 100% in stocks. His plan is to convert 1% a year to bonds. Too risky for me. Me on the other hand, 90+% stocks and 20-30 years to go. Of course I’d like to access it sooner.

2141 2018-06-14 03:48:08 Theres still a lot of kinks with the crypto valuation system thats not being talked about.

2171 2018-06-14 03:27:24 Defense stocks plunging after the North Korea summit is a reminder of why these companies have to spend so much money convincing politicians and media that their interests align with the public interest.
2172 2018-06-14 03:27:06 2A is a valid reason. Magazine size restrictions are a fantasy. Ban bump stocks, fine, but you should be aware that the same thing can be accomplished with a thumb in a pocket, and the "assault rifles" that are so demonized can't hold up long to a rapid rate of fire for long.

2241 2018-06-14 02:39:27 Good reporting Kyle, now I have a question for all you journalists:  why do you report daily, or more often, on the stock market but only rarely on wages?  The vast majority of Americans depend far more on wages than on stocks for their livelihood so why doesn't coverage align?
2242 2018-06-14 02:39:14 One common characteristic of all stocks that have turned multibaggers is a significant growth in Sales. Growth is, therefore, a very important parameter - a value stock will otherwise remain a Value stock unless there is growth in the company.

2247 2018-06-14 02:35:33 properties are great as long as they are full. Government bonds, precious metals are also good tangible investments. Stocks - best through mutual funds to ensure a diversified portfolio.  Then when peeps have a net, other riskier investments make sense.

2304 2018-06-14 01:50:28 He receives minimal wage.
He simply owns large portions of all of his companies’ stock, that’s why his net value is so high, if he was to sell all his stocks at what they’re priced right now, that’s how much money he’d have.
2305 2018-06-14 01:50:18 Ban bump stocks now!
2306 2018-06-14 01:49:32 Trillions of dollars the "Big Donor Swamp" and "Corporate Fat Cats" buying back their own stocks, while the average person makes less than $50,000 while spending more that half of this salary on Rent!!!
2307 2018-06-14 01:48:53 Smallcase is revolutionary idea, my father used to follow the same approach since I guess atleast from 20 yrs. Now his pf is SOLID. It's cheap to say i bought 10 stocks of X company every month,you think ppl will mock & look u like beggar. I say let them,u live for yourself not
2308 2018-06-14 01:48:34 I cant invest it. They just refund the money back to the charge card. The stocks app I use won't let me purchase w Amex
2309 2018-06-14 01:48:32 Who taught Yu how to trade stocks ; where Yu learn det shit at
2310 2018-06-14 01:48:14 Alright 7 points here;

1:Ban military grade weapons
2:Ban bump stocks
3:Ban “massive” magazines
4:Ban armor piercing rounds
5: tougher background checks
6:Gun shows
7:National firearm registry

Okay, first point. What is defined as a military grade weapon? What characteristics?
2311 2018-06-14 01:46:46 Name any other CEO who buys large blocks of his own stock OUTSIDE of regular trading hours (penny/pink sheet stocks do not apply)?
2312 2018-06-14 01:45:48 I’d buy Nintendo stocks if I could.
Maybe look into that
2313 2018-06-14 01:45:47 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to cure your insomnia
2314 2018-06-14 01:43:35 Once it does, the dollar is worthless, white flour and olive oil stocks will dry up, Darden Group giftcards won't be worth the plastic they're printed on.  That's basically Western civilization down the tubes.  Let's hope the AI is gluten sensitive.

2318 2018-06-14 01:42:30 I lost a lot in stocks (part of my retirement), my 401K has not preformed since Sept 2017 (more retirement), & I'm being denied college grants (I'm a full time student that can only work very little). The economy is terrible and consumer confidence is shit. He's horrible for us!

2320 2018-06-14 01:41:14 Stocks man, they’re the key to success
2321 2018-06-14 01:40:38 FYI, I realize sub penny stocks are a gamble. I'm fine with that, I only "invest" what I can afford to lose. 

I asked you a direct question. Name a sub penny stock you like... I will wait...
2322 2018-06-14 01:40:19 As of 9:35 a.m., PSEi 7,519.33 down 83.65 points or 1.10 percent. #PSEiupdate #PSEi #stocks
2323 2018-06-14 01:39:05 Few others i know in this space think that "Gains from stocks are nothing when compared to crypto. I easily get 100%+ in a day." They don't get that even for large cap companies, it can be just as lucrative if you trade options. Seriously. Don't go all in on one market.
2324 2018-06-14 01:39:03 Stocks dropped after Nintendo’s E3 presentation. It really does feel like they are riding high on the success of the Switch. Animal Crossing fans are so thirsty!
2325 2018-06-14 01:38:58 Ban bump stocks
2326 2018-06-14 01:37:15 Reggie isn't worrying about the recent decline in Nintendo stocks and says a lot more surprises are coming this year, it should be interesting
2327 2018-06-14 01:36:50 Stocks are always so fickle. They'll bounce back by the end of the week, I imagine. They sold so many 3DS and Switches.
2328 2018-06-14 01:36:38 Technical Analyst.  Use charts and statistics to predict path of stocks/coins
2329 2018-06-14 01:36:25 More announcements and reveals “In the coming weeks and months” is what Reggie said in that interview. This could be a good thing depending how much impact it’ll have on investors and stocks
2330 2018-06-14 01:35:58 Well, I doubt he'd openly admitt worry over stocks. He's probably trying to keep good face in front of consumers but behind the scenes he's worried. Who knows.
2331 2018-06-14 01:35:53 They bought in 2005, Alibaba IPOd in 2014. So between 2005 and 2014 the value of the private company would have been represented by yahoo publically traded stocks.

2352 2018-06-14 01:19:27 I also rant about how a billionaire moving stocks/wealth into a Foundation with a vague mandate entirely under his own control isn't actually "giving to charity",  just obscuring an org he has ideological goals for. (and maintaining control of his companies while saving on taxes)

2356 2018-06-14 01:14:14 US stocks fell on Wednesday as the Federal Reserve took a more hawkish tone on the future path of monetary policy, pointing to another two increases in interest rates in 2018 amid more opimistic economic growth forecasts and higher inflation expectations.
2357 2018-06-14 01:13:55 The financial markets, eg. stocks, bonds, interest rates, commodities, gold & currencies have been fixed by major financial institutions time and again.

Especially anything that competes with central bank issued fiat, just look at the gold market.

There is that too..

You and I both have to have faith that our stocks are being held by someone that wont turn around and screw us. We know banks like to do that though, so I guess it's all risk.
2385 2018-06-14 00:50:31 you are right, how will any stocks be taken if nobody is risking approaching eachother cause they are camping the blast zone. thanks for pointing that out.

2393 2018-06-14 00:46:14 Sounds like a burned shorter to me. Are u saying musk moved one of the most actively traded stocks in the world with $25mm? And he did that to move the stock price 0.2%??

2421 2018-06-14 00:21:01 Bump stocks don’t kill people!... goodness gracious... why is that concept so hard to grasp. It’s like putting a V8 in a vehicle. It’s an optional accessory.

2427 2018-06-14 00:13:15 What about bump stocks?
2428 2018-06-14 00:12:31 20 Trillion market cap, I believe so.

That's 10% of all value in cash, stocks, gold, bonds

In 2 years... no, not a chance 

5 years... possible.... 10 years, yes
