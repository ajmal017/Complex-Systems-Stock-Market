I'm trying to stay far away from products using this because of the deforestation caused to produce it. So if you don't want to support deforestation, watch chocolates, shampoos, vitamins, and gels for palm oil.

71 2018-12-25 23:50:12 So I spilt hair gel/oil on my bed at home this morning. It's left multiple big greasy marks which I've well hidden by "airing" my bed. Yet to tell mom and yes I'm 26 and still scared of being in trouble . What would you do?

87 2018-12-25 23:46:38 Why is it a wonder to most on why it is illegal? It was cotton vinyl and oil production that made hemp and cannabis illegal. It's not a secret. It's in the 1939 report and jack herra printed it in his book. Stop with the wondering lies.

96 2018-12-25 23:44:20 Not an issue if you get plenty of ALA, or eat foods fortified with EPA and DHA, or take algae oil instead of fish oil. Why do you think the bodies of fish contain omega 3? They mainly get it from the algae in their diet.

99 2018-12-25 23:42:57 Please pay attention because you’re not getting it. Questions about politicians’ records on climate are not attacks.

123 2018-12-25 23:37:49 Avocado oil has a higher smoke point than grape seed oil, has a much healthier profile, and (IMHO) tastes better.  But YMMV.  Can't go wrong with a hot cast iron skillet, though!

162 2018-12-25 23:28:31 I would agree if we weren't facing extinction from climate change that requires that we literally stop using oil, and I absolutely do not trust anyone from my home petroleum-dependent state of Texas to be able to steer us through that transition.

168 2018-12-25 23:27:58 dear president,
if you want to stock prices up, you should also want to rates up relatively high..and also oil prices should at 60s dollars..if rates and oil fall sharply at the same time market goes into riskoff mode..briefly you should change your mind to opposite direction.

176 2018-12-25 23:26:17 Many factors driving the market: politics, economic, corporate. Saudi control oil market? Trump competence? I think the biggie is  removal of the Fed put. Until the put is restored or facts change, market will reprice until returns on unlevered cash reflect symmetrical risk.
177 2018-12-25 23:26:00 I wonder if Yehuda Hamaccabi and his group were also Palestinian.

In the Palestinian Hannukah , the Palestinians liberated the Temple (no logic), sadly the oil only lasted 1 day, so they blamed the whole thing on a Zionist conspiracy (High priest was a Mossad agent obviously)

198 2018-12-25 23:21:24 That article is behind a pay wall. However I disagreed with Obama many times. Like when he enabled exporting oil and supported natural gas.
199 2018-12-25 23:21:16 I got an oil with it that's like lavender and lemon or something and not only does it smell great but it's definitely working to keep me relaxed and chilled out, I've just plunked it on my desk.

210 2018-12-25 23:19:54 Our liberal government seem to turn a blind eye to any protest  it seems. Most Canadians across this great country support pipelines and  our hard working oil workers in the West. Our day of reckoning is coming bye bye Trudeau and his liberal followers.

215 2018-12-25 23:19:17 Saudi Arabia is flooding the oil market & thus reducing gas prices. A reward for Trump’s ignoring the Saudi King’s approving the butchering a Washington Post Reporter.

282 2018-12-25 23:09:47 Thank you for the 5.36 too. That GUSH price close (if not the same) as what you projected for oil, again over 1 year ago.
283 2018-12-25 23:09:29 [SKINはOIL BALANCE]肌も、髪と同じ。角質層の表面を「皮脂膜」が覆っていて、肌の内部や水分を守るようにできています。洗浄力の強いもので洗うと、皮脂膜が失われ、日差しや空調で乾燥しやすい肌の状態になります。良質のオイルを使用したアイテムで、毎日のケアを心がけましょう。

285 2018-12-25 23:08:48 I could buy a soap mold, a brick of melt and pour, some colorants, and some blue raspberry fragrance oil Right Now. I could start my destiny Today

you fossils need to go bury yourselves,and then you'de be worth something...."OIL"
BUT IT MAY TAKE A FEW THOUSAND YEARS....
289 2018-12-25 23:07:33 That may or may not be why they were deployed (why the government sent them), but likely they personally are serving for more noble reasons than you list. Like, they didn't wake up & say, "I think I'll enlist so I can spend Christmas alone so America can steal oil..."
290 2018-12-25 23:07:25 Love to try the firming oil! Thank you 
291 2018-12-25 23:07:17 So President Trump should only have public discussions.  Can you name another President that never met with foreign leaders in private? I’ll wait. And he’s nice to Putin how? BO gave Ukraine blankets, Trump weapons. BO tried to kill oil, Trump opened it up and is trying to kill
292 2018-12-25 23:07:16 Hmm... wasn't the 1970s when the EROI (Energy ROI) for oil began to sink? That would be a factor for the dip in GDP growth thereafter. Also, decline in fertility rates from the Baby Boom. GDP correlates well with increased automation & high fertility rates, EROI, & Food ROI.

299 2018-12-25 23:05:59 Yes, that funding is 4 digits, and oil is 6 digits. But, I bet that six digit controls the NRA too. And, on top of that you'll find someone else. Until you eventually get to the top. And at the top, is Palpatine. And he is the Senate. He is also President. Of every country.

322 2018-12-25 23:01:46 I quit smoking, but I would eat it, and manage to use the oil without inhaling. When I smoked, I always French-inhaled. I don't know how or why, but it was likely a past life thing. I miss it. Too much damage to the lungs. I used to do shrooms too.
323 2018-12-25 23:01:46 The fact that Trey Burke is still on the team says a lot. The entire Frank situation is dumb & pointless for everyone. Either play Frank for trade him because the snake oil excuses won’t hold forever.

344 2018-12-25 22:58:58 @PollytheAnna The budget tea turns out to be orange pekoe and it came out fine. I was worried that Earl Grey's bergamont oil would sour after I brewed it, that's why I got the other (also cost). It's in the fridge, we'll see if the sugar stays in suspension. It tasted great hot.

363 2018-12-25 22:54:55 1. Agreed
2. siding with one civil rights cause & Trump impeachment doesn’t make someone who’s voted for oil exports, expanded CPB, weakened Dodd Frank, etc a progressive.

Beto is a member of the moderate New Dems. He is not a member of the Progressive Caucus. That’s his choice.

366 2018-12-25 22:54:50 The terrorists attacked only those countries which want raw oil of Middle East. Mass media of USA, EU, Russia, UK do not say about it, because their owners do not want it. 
Israel do not recognize Golodomor in Ukraine in 1930s. Israel do not recognize the crimes of Jews in NKVD.
367 2018-12-25 22:54:32 Saudi Arabia is only "immensely wealthy" as long as the world runs on Oil. Time is running out, House of Saud. I pray for the people of "Saudi A". I pray that the world recognizes the crimes committed by SA's leadership DO NOT reflect the will/heart of the Saudi people.

370 2018-12-25 22:54:16 Yea especially in Houston which relies heavily on jobs in the oil and gas industry. It's a double edge sword because when gas prices high it hurts the consumer, but when it's lower it potentially affects employees.
371 2018-12-25 22:54:10 Some interesting points in that article on oil spend/GDP. At 2.25%+ it can weigh on the economy. $60 oil works out to 2.5%. So accordingly to the article anything above $60 will start to weigh on the economy using 2018 GDP projections. 1/3

Do you want a young president like Beto who is fighting against Medicare-4-all, helps banks fight regulation, and takes money from oil companys then helps them protect offshore drilling? Or an old one who does the opposite. Millions of progressives want the latter
426 2018-12-25 22:45:03 กูงง
427 2018-12-25 22:45:00 Bro I’m trying to stay away from oil.  merry Christmas and happy holiday guys @ThaLiveKing
428 2018-12-25 22:44:59 It's all in the parboiling and the sizzling hot oil 
429 2018-12-25 22:44:51 Lol people are so mad I have a high tolerance. Smoke some 1 gram of oil/day out of a dab rig and then say something.
430 2018-12-25 22:44:15 You could accomplish that instantly by removing federal subsidies from fossil fuel companies. That's the point, it's NOT cheaper when you factor in all the real costs. But big oil owns Congress. They will not tolerate legislation that negatively impacts their profit margin.
431 2018-12-25 22:44:01 I don't care how bad I feel, I'm not taking castor oil.
432 2018-12-25 22:43:58 ahora falta de regalo ..que muestres algunas fotos de la Britni 

con eso ya para completamos el combo ganador!
433 2018-12-25 22:43:57 Last in Japan, or did it just get oil on my dress.
434 2018-12-25 22:43:49 おはようございます〜(*´ω`*)b
435 2018-12-25 22:43:46 The war criminal and terrorist Netanyahu is more interested on how long he can continue to steal oil and resources. I would think even this POS know his time is limited in Syria
436 2018-12-25 22:43:25 I think I've told a lie, I got CBD vape oil, not the CBD liquid.

That being said, my sister uses it, and I tried that. I think the does was something like 20 drops and she gave me 6. 10 minutes later you could have pulled my teeth out and I'd have been laughing about it.
437 2018-12-25 22:43:13 That’s because he is a phony! I have to say he is a great snake oil salesman.
438 2018-12-25 22:43:04 オレ、キョウモ、ムショク！ヤルキ、ゲンキ、ムショク！オハヨウゴザイマス。
439 2018-12-25 22:43:01 I've been dousing orphan socks with lavender oil and stuffing them in various places, but I think I need to up the ante and get some cedar balls or something
440 2018-12-25 22:42:51 Supercheap 30% off store wide.
Oil for the Ute.
441 2018-12-25 22:42:49 Have ya seen the price of oil lately?ya think the Saudis will be spending their treasure on another country?
442 2018-12-25 22:42:37  this one brain engine lack oil e don knock
443 2018-12-25 22:42:30 Baba your head get oil
444 2018-12-25 22:42:00 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
445 2018-12-25 22:41:43 I had to go close an oil deal real quick 
446 2018-12-25 22:40:15 これかー。
真輔帰ってきたら嬉しいけど、、
447 2018-12-25 22:40:05 Body “oil”
448 2018-12-25 22:40:05 サラダ油って体に悪いんですか？サラダなのに？
449 2018-12-25 22:40:02 I'm just waiting for the "drink this essential oil cut with magic lemur piss, shove a purple crystal up your ass & not only will it cure your cold but it will rebuild you immune system into steel" nonsense to start, with that one.
450 2018-12-25 22:39:59 Use hemp oil and see how well it work
451 2018-12-25 22:39:58 Clearly? Please explain
452 2018-12-25 22:39:41 I know this isn’t anything crazy, but my essential oil diffuser actually helps to calm me down!!
453 2018-12-25 22:39:36 Didn't know voting for war and taking money from oil employees makes you a populist candidate 
454 2018-12-25 22:39:36 If Alberta left I bet they would have no problem negotiating a deal with the USA for pipeline access to export their oil and eventually they would be the first province to become a US State!
455 2018-12-25 22:39:33 HUGE trade in oil names coming up. Don't know when but should be on everyones radar.
456 2018-12-25 22:39:02 Oil/gas embargo should do it, plus turn off SWIFT
457 2018-12-25 22:38:52 Boiled potatoes, oil in the bottom of the pan, chopped spinach, garam masala, salt and pepper, add in the potatoes to the spinach. The starch on the potatoes with bind with the liquid from the spinach to form a coating.
It’s honestly that easy.
458 2018-12-25 22:38:41 Do you know that as secretary of state, hillary met with governments around the planet promoting

Fracking?

Did you know Obama was going to let Shell Oil drill in the Arctic Ocean,

until even Shell realized that was an insane idea and backed down?
459 2018-12-25 22:38:25 No, other countries are already using renewable energy. We cannot afford to increase oil and gas production because we cannot afford increased climate change. #Climatechange is starting to become catastrophic, we cannot remain dependent on dinosaur fuels.
460 2018-12-25 22:38:16 The Turks (along with US/Israel/Saudi) are responsible for the Syrian Civil War in the first place and profited from trade in oil stolen by ISIS. The Turks were happy to carve up Syria until Israel & the US started working with the Kurds in earnest. A pox on all imperialism
461 2018-12-25 22:37:59 AND I halved the olive oil and made up for the extra dryness with water... she snapped on this one
462 2018-12-25 22:37:57 This is utterly compelling, and another crack in the glass bottle of the reductionist snake oil we are being forced to imbibe.
God I love good honest objective science. So rare it seems these days.
463 2018-12-25 22:37:56 Actually it because he takes money from big oil and is NOT a progressive. That's just a start.
464 2018-12-25 22:37:30 I’d be impressed if the woman learned to speak English! Who knows what she’s saying? Nice example to daughters strip down oil up, sell your body, skip education & marry a pu..y grabbing vulgar pig cheating in his wife
465 2018-12-25 22:37:22 Your debating skills was fine and fella slick. There is always someone out there trying to water down masculinity. When u see flowers it does fine across as feminine in nature. You don’t see car oil or hammers advertise on women essential products. You see flowers and other stuff
466 2018-12-25 22:37:00 I was setting up my essential oil diffuser and accidentally started a cult circle
467 2018-12-25 22:36:42 What do we expect Venezuela to do when we, USA blocks them from selling oil to open markets and threaten other countries in doing trades/business with them.
I won’t be surprised if China get involved also.
468 2018-12-25 22:36:40 Christmas: when you start using "Stress Release" essential oil instead of deodorant.
469 2018-12-25 22:36:29 Hi. My name is Mariah. I am 75% percent migraine today. Thank you government for legalizing CBD oil. Now I am 25% pain free. 
It's a Christmas miracle. Someone pinch me.
470 2018-12-25 22:35:33 You get the impression that if Trump were the guy changing the oil in the cruller fryer at Dunkin’ Donuts rather than the president of the United States, he would have been quietly removed months ago. #TrumpResign
471 2018-12-25 22:35:32 No...it clearly isn't.
472 2018-12-25 22:35:24 Conspiracy theory: The US government was bought off back in the late 1800s by the oil/railroad barons and has been controlled by the .1% from behind the scenes since then.
473 2018-12-25 22:35:22 What oil and gas assets?
Companies are not countries.
474 2018-12-25 22:35:03 I thought this is something like an app creating  oil painting pics or videos. Only me?
475 2018-12-25 22:34:35 Wait until the oil runs out, probably in about ten years or less. Let us see where Aliyev and his plastic wife and daughters will be running to. No European country will have them, so maybe they can take refuge in Saudi Arabia, like Idi Amin Dada! Interesting times we live in...
476 2018-12-25 22:34:30 A couple of things with Armageddon have aged poorly. Harry as an oil man trying to assault green peace protestors. Harry trying to literally shoot Ben Affleck in the first 10min. NASA figures out a very complicated plan in days. Love this movie.
477 2018-12-25 22:34:07 Um. How to oil paint
478 2018-12-25 22:33:58 Love #argan oil? Remember that it's only made in #Morocco. If it comes from another country, it's probably not the real thing.
479 2018-12-25 22:33:54 My gma just asked me if cbd oil was drugs
480 2018-12-25 22:33:43 ผมทรงลิง 555555
481 2018-12-25 22:33:28 And please, don't forget to change the oil... in your vehicles and your pans and deep fryers.
482 2018-12-25 22:33:05 Fish oil normally contains a mixture of EPA and DHA. Extensive processing is required to create a nearly pure DHA fish oil.

If you need a high potency DHA, algae oil can provide pure DHA and may actually be a superior alternative because less processing is required.
483 2018-12-25 22:32:51 Let me know what product, only using coconut oil
484 2018-12-25 22:32:43 Dont be this person. Just horrible.
485 2018-12-25 22:31:52 Turkey, olive oil while spinning, Montreal Chicken spice while spinning. 

Water bath underneath. Replenish every hour as needed. 

Indirect heat + Infrared if u have one.

High heat first 30-40 minutes to sear.  

325-360 degrees until done. 

Rest 45-60 minutes before carving.
486 2018-12-25 22:31:46 "The spice must flow." Doesn't sound like oil to me.
487 2018-12-25 22:31:39 know the feeling and cbd oil isn't even legal here. or available, at least. instead they put me on benzos, but I'm better now. how stupid.
488 2018-12-25 22:31:20 すいすい水曜日は睡眠の日～
489 2018-12-25 22:30:53 It is fascinating; the power plays and separate but all part of the whole. We need to get off oil. ..you too..have a good Xmas..

492 2018-12-25 22:30:33 Fun fact.....oil.  They spend all their money as soon as they get it.
493 2018-12-25 22:30:31 Have you read the Lisbon Treaty - In 2022 we’d become an EU state, & have to give up our currency, sovereignty, nationality. No more Queen or King. Also our fishing rights become owned by EU, and all gas, oil, minerals, all EU property. Financial centres all moved to Strasbourg!!
494 2018-12-25 22:30:28 CBD oil is what I use for endometriosis pain. If your over 21 & depending on your state you reside in, you can go to a shop & ask for CBD oil roll on sticks or a pen to smoke. You can also get a medical marijuana card online. They have a doctor call & ask why & you explain

496 2018-12-25 22:30:26 my mum got me cannabis oil as an extra gift as a reward for good grades this term and I’m honestly so gassed for an anxiety free 2019
497 2018-12-25 22:30:24 “Did you see the 60 minutes segment on olive oil?” - my dad
498 2018-12-25 22:30:00 This project has just been not getting good volatile oil extraction because we've just been throwin it in on top....
499 2018-12-25 22:29:46 Personally I don’t think any candidate that has not been personally anointed with holy oil by God can really be called charismatic
500 2018-12-25 22:29:45 yes, but the term 'allies' is also delusional, as USA only needed these allies' oil, Russia primarily wants its bases around Latakiya and so on. Syria basically doesn't exist anymore, as it is being devided by other powers. Sultan Erdogan will soon move in too to take the north
501 2018-12-25 22:29:41 Why my grandma smell like motor oil?
502 2018-12-25 22:29:36 First Dates was the best programme I have watched this Xmas..
Brillianty 
503 2018-12-25 22:28:52 Congratulations bro. May your enemies fall like crude oil price in Nigeria. But that iMax is enough for you to add the money into your business.
504 2018-12-25 22:28:24 Indian food from outside almost always makes people sick because they cut corners on proper spicing with excess vegetable oil and salt. It’s not that white ppl can’t digest it; no one can digest it. Blessed to have home-cooked Indian food 
505 2018-12-25 22:28:16 Pomp - OPEC/Banks =Fiat
Fracking=Bitcoin
10 yrs ago oil almost $150 barrel I'm not a frack guy but super disruptive
cumulative effect of NO fracking was 10 yrs of Saudi controlled gouging
WITH Fracking/Bitcoin oil now under $50/barrel
506 2018-12-25 22:28:02 I put a oil herbs and salt in the water.
507 2018-12-25 22:27:59 I’ve been taking it and I like it but I also think it might be placebo. Also, I take capsules, and if you go that route actually get the oil because the brand I have is just mashed up plant and you’ll burp pot smell all day
508 2018-12-25 22:27:54 スリー様からいいねが飛んできた……何回かこっそり見に行ってます()
509 2018-12-25 22:27:51 Here’s a fun fact: if you add up the GDP of 22 Arab countries with a population of 200 million, where 50% of the GDP is derived from oil, that total GDP is equivalent to Holland plus Switzerland.
510 2018-12-25 22:27:13 No frigging way a squeeze on gas would take things down like this. Oil may be - but $spy, no.
511 2018-12-25 22:27:10 The squeaky wheel gets the grease and the federal and provincial Conservatives spend so much time greasing that wheel you would think the whole province works in the oil and gas industry when 90% of us don't and would like to know what they would do for us if they get elected.
512 2018-12-25 22:27:04 The mass exportation of oil started a while ago tho. It's not like it started yesterday!
513 2018-12-25 22:27:03 Oil dey your head my G anointed! God bless you!
514 2018-12-25 22:26:52 We pop ours in coconut oil... so yummy! Really only needs a touch of salt and a little butter if you like it.
515 2018-12-25 22:26:45 didn’t know I needed an oil diffuser til harris gave me one 
516 2018-12-25 22:26:44 Trump’s new Christmas song:

517 2018-12-25 22:26:33 What about what a woman couldn’t do that day, like get their car oil changed?
518 2018-12-25 22:26:22 Ok oil
519 2018-12-25 22:25:54 So that you can put any wax oil making it sus af and dangerous. If you don’t already smoke wax pens don’t even start
520 2018-12-25 22:25:49 @DStvNgCare @DStvNg @DStv it's been 3 days my signal went off, and I've tried my possible best to restore, but all efforts prove futile.
521 2018-12-25 22:25:40 Did you actually think about your last sentence. Quebec disrupts the flow of good and services all the time. NFLD power, AB oil. Que is no better or deserves different than any prov but they think everyone should heel to them. That is the reason AB will sep & take our fair share
522 2018-12-25 22:25:37 No weed for me just pills... I wish my Doctor could prescribe Marinol Oil or something natural for my pain... I am SICK of taking pills..
Last night I forgot them and have been in pain all day.
523 2018-12-25 22:25:23 I'd say our relatively recent problems with Iran started with Nixon's half assed support for Israel in the 1973 Yom Kippur war/oil crisis, before that they were happy to sell us barrels of oil for 3 or 5 bucks
524 2018-12-25 22:25:08 between the oil diffuser from sam & the four candles i got from other people my room is gonna smell SO good
525 2018-12-25 22:24:37 Get the 5 Billion embezzle & launder it, cause the dollar to bottom out along with the stock market & help Putin and The Crown Prince with a power grab of Syria. It is about real estate oil & water rights. Trump will try to move to Russia like the ousted Putin Backed Pres Of 
526 2018-12-25 22:24:32 Citizen subject. He know what i meant. Once in a lifetime. Once in a generation. They said it. Are they liars, bullshitters or snake oil salesmen?
527 2018-12-25 22:24:16 I put cbd oil in my vitamin water this morning tell everyone
528 2018-12-25 22:24:04 Actually, closer to $1.47 back in early 2016.. because oil dropped to $26/barrel. It hasn't touched $1.50 since 2002..
529 2018-12-25 22:23:58 Hope you measured the oil with the turkey in it :)
530 2018-12-25 22:23:50 ねんむ
531 2018-12-25 22:23:45 To go after a word I used like a pit bull to prove your point is well and good. But really supporting a guy that voted to tear down ACA. For oil companies. For deregulation of wall street. Lol your lie is right up there in your bio dude.
532 2018-12-25 22:23:37 Yeah, thanks for destroying our country by handing it over to big business and big oil.
533 2018-12-25 22:23:32 Look at his voting records. Looking cute but accepting money from oil companies while pledging no- is Not good enough. We need real transition. Yes he has a heart and compassion for immigrants. But his voting records matter!
534 2018-12-25 22:22:57 so so happy I got my oil diffuser 
535 2018-12-25 22:22:45 Sell your snake oil elsewhere. Healthcare reform yes. Obamacare disaster and sold on lies. Remember this little ditty from a popular dem. “We had to pass the bill to find out what’s in the bill” well, now we know and it is an unaffordable disaster being dismantled by our POTUS
536 2018-12-25 22:22:42 Now that you bring up holocaust, I can kinda see why the comments are taken the wrong way. I initially interpreted the statement to be akin the way that people talk about oil money as Arab money.
537 2018-12-25 22:22:17 ✿°Tweet apreciativo de mi cabello(??? Toy happy pq cada vez mejora más thanks coconut oil.
538 2018-12-25 22:22:16 who knew  trying to make sure we can stop #climatechange  by taking #ClimateAction aka making sure we don't elect people like Beto who take money from Big oil & supports fracking was so awful?  The guy lost to ted Cruz for god shake that's all you need to know about beto!
539 2018-12-25 22:22:15 Ok so we're on episode 5 and I hate how it looks kind of like an oil slick
540 2018-12-25 22:22:11 An Iran that is integrated into the economic systems of China & India will look very different to the Gulf petrostate that we've known so far. This strengthens the progressive forces in society enormously. Allows us to imagine an Iran beyond oil, & maybe 1 day, beyond theocracy.
541 2018-12-25 22:22:03 Highly recommend It! I switched from anxiety medication to CBD oil (1000 mg) and it has helped so much. I haven’t had a panic attack since..no more shitty side effects like I was having with my prescription meds too
542 2018-12-25 22:21:50 Yeh just oil paint effect
543 2018-12-25 22:20:53 lazily made a banana loaf but didnt melt the oil first so reckon its just gna hav lunps of oil in it when its done. amazing.
544 2018-12-25 22:20:26 Oil of Olas damit dir Weinachtsganz auch schön zart wird 
545 2018-12-25 22:20:20 Well that or the #Khashoggi murder exoneration deal with BMS for low oil prices. Something stinks....
546 2018-12-25 22:20:18 Risk intermediation by banks has evolved Q4 2018 with #DarkInventory in run off. New #OilStandard paradigm in my analysis is direct USD monetisation of US shale oil via unlimited bank lending with market risk on-exchange & Fed liquidity. This is currently Dark to the market
547 2018-12-25 22:20:11 So I need a good massage!!! 
Requirements: 
Soft hands, oil, and not afraid to use the elbow grease (that same elbow grease your grandma tell you to use when helping in the kitchen).... this back is hurting to the infinity power!!!
548 2018-12-25 22:19:59 Castor oil and coconut oils help
549 2018-12-25 22:19:56 I’ve tried a CBD pen and it didn’t really help me. But I’ve heard good things about the oil and/or gummies...gummies I felt an effect immediately.
550 2018-12-25 22:19:43 いやあ…林原さんがもしやるとしての演じ分けは見ものですけど、さおりん辺りにやって欲しいですねw
551 2018-12-25 22:19:27 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime
552 2018-12-25 22:18:58 Grandma got CBD oil for Christmas and my mom told her not to smoke it and she said,” well yeah, it’ll get the paper wet.”
Okay G-ma.

555 2018-12-25 22:18:52 Cooking in a Chinese Mom’s kitchen is an eat-at-your-own-risk science experiment because the oil is in the maple syrup bottle, the salt is in the Nescafé tin, and the cornstarch is in the peanut butter jar. I think. #ihopethisissalt #nothingislabeled #asianrecycling #help
556 2018-12-25 22:18:47 The fact that oil and gas made donations to both Senatorial candidates in Texas is not a huge surprise.  The fact that ORourke accepted the money is very noteworthy.
557 2018-12-25 22:18:44 The rest of Canadians work or try to get a job. Stop relying on social assistance - support pipelines rather than protesting.  Soon there will be no $$ in government coffers for anyone - since the PM doesn’t value oil -expects the Canadian economy to survive  on maple syrup.
558 2018-12-25 22:18:30 I don’t personally like to do that. I relied on my glove oil and catching bullpens
559 2018-12-25 22:18:27 BTW, you’re confusing PAC money with individual donations. Beto took money from oil executives, which broke his pledge. Watch for the establishment to always use weasel words to divert.
560 2018-12-25 22:18:25 You now: "his record on oil and gas as a tx rep makes sense"

You earlier: "why is the Vermont senator not helping out in Texas where the Texas rep is HMMMMMMM?"
561 2018-12-25 22:17:59 Why does anyone listen to this snake oil salesman, anymore?

572 2018-12-25 22:15:54 Kooks like you were spouting this nonsense in the Bush years about Iraq and oil. Obama was elected and you dropped that phony narrative like a hot potato. This is phony too.
573 2018-12-25 22:15:53 I would give my left nut to get some fresh olive oil.
574 2018-12-25 22:15:38 *tells my dad not to step on my wet oil painting

Simple but effective
578 2018-12-25 22:14:42 Like the Prime Minister somehow controls the price of oil.
579 2018-12-25 22:14:34 And Arabs weren’t associated with money until the mass exportation of oil. There has been no historical context In which Arabs with money has been used in a negative manner.
580 2018-12-25 22:14:22 While I would agree with that, the real issue isn't Trump is it? He hasn't a clue how to fix these issues. The sale & trading of oil & weapons is the root here, Trump's just the current face on it.
581 2018-12-25 22:14:16 If not coconut oil and I’m not broke, I use @_LULUcosmetics serum..the glow be crazy.

585 2018-12-25 22:13:21 Followed a @kenjilopezalt recipe for roasted potatoes. Infusing oil with garlic and rosemary made for an amazing side for the prime rib, which also had garlic and rosemary 
586 2018-12-25 22:13:12 Oh you mean like when Obama bragged about increasing oil production, then lied about supporting the climate agreement.  Yeah, fanboy, facts are awful.
587 2018-12-25 22:13:00 @efragrances28 I have a scented body oil which I'm running out of. Would you be able to recreate it from a sample ?

590 2018-12-25 22:12:55 What’s Snake Oil?
591 2018-12-25 22:12:50 A little....It was obvious that the spike was bogus...Oil and equities melted on Monday and the CAD did not move...The Nikkei melted overnight and the CAD was still flat...With no news there was no way this could spike during Christmas.
592 2018-12-25 22:12:48 Would you say that this would have prompted a similar backlash if @21savage would have stated that he was making Arab money in reference to the wealth made by a number of Arabs from oil? 50% of the billionaires in the us are Jewish it was an aspirational lyric.
593 2018-12-25 22:12:46 Literallly nothing  long as it’s a natural soap, I’m using it.

Astringent & coconut oil afterwards. Cold water to rinse
594 2018-12-25 22:12:35 Oh look what so starting right at us in the face top killers-the oil and gas automotive (hand in glove) industry and defense. There are powers deep that want to keep us at each other's throats and so dependent on cars we don't mind killing one another just to get around.
595 2018-12-25 22:12:14 It is not a problem as the banks lay off the risk. This is why #oil price fall accelerated recently due to gamma going exponential as we approached put strikes.

Only thing that gives me any relief at all is turmeric tea w coconut oil, almond milk, cinnamon, ginger, blk pepper and honey. Might be worth a shot

Leave North to Turkey for now letting them take out some/most of the SDF (poss even pull out of qamishlo) Then deal with Turkey in a year or two. Easiest and most obvious and will get Putin approval...

613 2018-12-25 22:09:35 Oh no I agree Trump has no clue but the US issues with oil and weapons started long ago. He's is just the face on it now. This hardly the forum to fix these issue, despite what Trump tweets.

620 2018-12-25 22:08:06 I think he did it intentionally to comply with the Plan he has with Russia China & Saudi Arabia. My theory is Trump has always had planned to profit from Real Estate Oil & water rights in the ME when Putin executed a power grab of Syria.
621 2018-12-25 22:08:02 He’s not a Progressive he’s a 3rd way Democrat and belongs to the New Democrat Coalition which is NOT progressive. He refuses to stop taking oil and gas money he won’t support Medicare for All and he won’t join the congressional progressive Caucus. This is fact.

643 2018-12-25 22:04:25 Oil workers average 100k. If you think that puts them anywhere near the highest paid jobs then you're mistaken. Many desk jobs will pay way more than that, and not be 99% male

658 2018-12-25 22:02:07 The amount of power that goes into manufacturing panels is really insignificant compared to the amount  they generate. Sad about how the plastics are manufactured when we have the tech to make any plastics from biological sources like canola oil.

•In the colder seasons mix your favorite body lotion with some coconut oil fir extra moisture 
664 2018-12-25 22:00:40 Markets deal with it by creating consequences we all react to.  In this case, the consequence is good for the consumer.  Every drop of oil we produce is new value created, not just moved around.  Those that do it well will... those that can't, go away.

672 2018-12-25 22:00:08 President Trump is right.  The Middle Eastern nations who are so rich with oil money need to start paying for their own protection instead of the USA bearing the burden.

690 2018-12-25 21:57:10 Another 400,000 tons were burned in recycled oil drums.
691 2018-12-25 21:56:58 Honestly an extra 10% isn’t going to make THAT much of a difference. The point is cartridges in general aren’t supposed to be your main sorce of getting high. Get a dab rig and some oil then come at me.

694 2018-12-25 21:56:40 1/2 While speculators/hedgies have expectations they tend to trade Months 2/3 liquidity. Most financial long passive funds are the opposite of active speculators. They offload $ risk in favour of oil risk to producers hedging by offloading oil risk in favour of $ risk.

707 2018-12-25 21:54:26 With new sources of oil/gas in the Mideast and the boom in US oil  production, the political leverage held by the ME oil ministers via  price fixing is dead. A world awash in cheap energy is a world that can  feed itself and raise the standard of living for the masses.
708 2018-12-25 21:54:26 If that person likes it, I would use a light non-scented oil and make sure no wound is open.

739 2018-12-25 21:50:02 We should not kill the golden goose until there is a plan. Say we set aside 2% or whatever % of the 25 trillion $ of oil in the ground in AB & put it into a fund to hire the smartest people to get us off fossil fuel & tell them you have 10 yrs, go. I would pay something for that.
740 2018-12-25 21:49:56 He uses stats in deliberately deceptive ways. E.g. "Beto was the #1 recipient of oil & gas industry money!" 1) Because he raised so much, he was the #1 or #2 recipient for every single industry. 2) Those aren't from corporations as implied, it's just who donors work for.

755 2018-12-25 21:45:51 How do you like delusional commentators that cry over even a partial failure of the USA's neocolonialim and its regime change coups and proxy wars? And their idea that oil is Russia's only income?
756 2018-12-25 21:45:03 the international community that demands that every border on earth remain open to refugees is the same one that would rise up to save us, en masse, if the USA decided to formalize their implicit control of Canadian oil wells and just roll right over you. pick your battles.
757 2018-12-25 21:45:00 i guess it's too much for you to imagine that some progressives simply aren't thrilled by a candidate who's voted to prop up the oil and gas industry.

792 2018-12-25 21:37:49 Exact. Of course it sits there like an iceberg to squeeze & sink unwary shorts. Oil is what UK regulators used to call a False Market & it should be prohibited in the global public interest. Problem is (as I said to UK Treasury Committee July 2008) - there is no global regulation

“Get your title back with TitleMax.” It’s a pawn arrangement.

So the simple arguments of cash and carry don't apply to oil. Economic exposure is not sufficient.
851 2018-12-25 21:24:10 @chigrl hi ..what's the latest oil prices ..
852 2018-12-25 21:24:00 Did you get really funny looks pouring on oil and striking the sacred runes upon its casing?
853 2018-12-25 21:23:46 I got a brand new board, bindings and boots, hue lights, a new Alexa, and an oil diffuser Christmas did me good this year
854 2018-12-25 21:23:34 I could probably fry eggs with the amount of oil that’s on my face 
855 2018-12-25 21:23:25 Ragu is the best still if quality ground beef is added . A little olive oil butter and the right amount of salt pepper onions and garlic . Simmer it down
856 2018-12-25 21:23:14 I anointed myself with oil today, haven’t done it in a while and it felt so good
857 2018-12-25 21:23:13 Substantiated? Golan Oil?
858 2018-12-25 21:22:58 i NEED cbd oil, who wants to buy it for me thx
859 2018-12-25 21:22:27 ~ with you if you would decide that you don't want it... that this is too dangerous for you..." He add while he put something from the oil on his hand to warm it up a bit.
860 2018-12-25 21:22:20 wanna see oil futures opened ... and all those taking long on oil just because it should bounce ... Oil is not BOUNCING at bear markets...
861 2018-12-25 21:22:20 My dad & step mom got me a doterra diffuser & included an oil for focus & calming for the kids & for Hayden’s ADHD. I already got it all set up & going!!
862 2018-12-25 21:22:07 Not a lot of oil actually to Turkey or certainly Qatar, but material amounts to local groups.
863 2018-12-25 21:22:00 So far his negotiations have been a disaster, just like driving up oil prices, USA is a net EXPORTER of oil. Wasn’t too bright. Just pointing out facts here, the oil is a far bigger catalyst than tarrifs, but tarrifs have done a ton of damage to mkt and many US industries
864 2018-12-25 21:21:38 I hope this tissue oil works I want my backside to look good and smooth...
865 2018-12-25 21:21:21 I love it.  I’ve always wondered why every other oil is sold in designer bottles while canola oil is sold in an ugly plastic jug.
866 2018-12-25 21:21:19 Coconut oil is actually useful in any situation

871 2018-12-25 21:20:32 I made yuca with garlic sauce yesterday. So good: yuca, garlic, onion, olive oil, and lemon juice.
872 2018-12-25 21:20:27 Well there'd be no coal or oil since virtually no women work in mines or on offshore rigs so no power or electricity but enjoy being safe in the dark.
873 2018-12-25 21:20:15 Italian Seasoned Creamy Potato soup

1. Cut onions up and sautee them till brown 2. Mix onions, oil, and flour together till thick 3. Add chicken broth and milk in 4. Add cut up potatoes in the pot 5. Let simmer for 30min till thick 5. (Optional) Add seasonings or topping
874 2018-12-25 21:20:12 *goes to gun smiths to pick up some gun oil*
875 2018-12-25 21:20:12 I got a weighted blanket, a white noise machine, and an essential oil diffuser. So as you can tell, there's a theme
876 2018-12-25 21:19:58 “Coconut oil cures everything, you can use it to fix your credit” - @shelbysummm
877 2018-12-25 21:19:57 Giiiirl, I forgot! I haven’t tried this yet but you can also do an avocado mask! I think some people mix it with olive oil, I’m sure it’d be fine plain too. It’s supposed to be good for your hair
878 2018-12-25 21:19:46 Oil pen be having my ass super geeked
879 2018-12-25 21:19:29 Like do y’all know how much body wash and oil i am getting tmrw .
880 2018-12-25 21:19:09 Please without oil the world population would have to drop, starve, by 5 bllion soles! Climate has been going on forever without oil?!? Get a teal  job!
881 2018-12-25 21:19:01 A few years ago my SO gave me a snow globe with carollers inside that makes music and looks like an old oil lantern. It was so thoughtful and beautiful #IndigoEvents
882 2018-12-25 21:18:56 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。
883 2018-12-25 21:18:38 My cousin got me some hemp oil and I feel like such a badass adult now.
884 2018-12-25 21:18:34 This is heart breaking:  the price of oil has fallen so low, the Koch brothers will have to lay off 6 GOP senators and most of the remaining GOP congress.  No word yet if Putin will step up with additional funds laundered thru the NRA, or Trump will ask MBS for addl dirty $$$
885 2018-12-25 21:18:10 My mom is so drunk right now that she thought the fireball was olive oil 
886 2018-12-25 21:17:57 Proof? Just your feelings? Believe it or not, some democrats don’t want someone that votes like a republican when it comes to big oil. We can’t afford that when the planet is literally melting. Reporting someone’s voting record isn’t an attack.
887 2018-12-25 21:17:47 Have to be careful in identifying oil producers, consumers and contractors (paid by the barrel). There's a mismatch in the maturity desire of producers (lock-in the marginal costs of production over 5 - 10 years say) and consumers (lock-in the next six months to create a budget).
888 2018-12-25 21:17:38 You always look dry get some oil
889 2018-12-25 21:17:35 今日はオフ会だ！
890 2018-12-25 21:17:15 Obama opened up more oil & gas drilling than any other prez.

Dems do not help the environment.

#Hemp, bamboo, an end to factory farming, and fusion energy are what save the biosphere. Hillary was nowhere on any of that.
891 2018-12-25 21:16:44 US Closing prices: #DOW -2.91% #NASDAQ -0.00% #Ftse100 -0.52% #Gold -0.00% #Oil -0.00%
892 2018-12-25 21:16:29 I also opened a cool spa oil diffuser that was also taken, I was the only one who got stuff taken from
893 2018-12-25 21:16:28 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
894 2018-12-25 21:16:00 my videos with hella oil in it >>> i need to sell these bitches 
895 2018-12-25 21:15:53 Where can I buy oil for my car on Christmas?????
896 2018-12-25 21:15:33 So you're saying that there can't be a good reason to refuse giving the Democratic ticket to a Texan with strong ties to Big Oil as the world burns?
897 2018-12-25 21:15:26 O’Rourke’s legislative history also shows his support of the fossil fuel industry. He broke with his party to vote twice to lift a 40-year oil export ban and he voted down Democratic legislation to stop drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.
898 2018-12-25 21:15:21 And ISIS kills many more Muslims than non Muslims .and Christians have done the same ..but doesn’t change history of Western support for despots , impeding  the democratic progress of the peoples of the region in its aim to control oil reserves .Illegal Iraq War /no WMDs/for oil
899 2018-12-25 21:15:10 Is jujube an omega 3 fish oil?
900 2018-12-25 21:15:04 On the contrary in this instance it is about a gas pipeline that they want to run through Syria which Assad won't allow, also you tell me why Genie Oil and Gas are involved with the Golan Heights currently occupied by Israel.
901 2018-12-25 21:14:54 This wig business is lowkey the next oil money
902 2018-12-25 21:14:43 There is a boat in everything /

909 2018-12-25 21:13:03 mustard oil and bethazone .1%
910 2018-12-25 21:12:56 What is the crude oil sentiment?
911 2018-12-25 21:12:48 Magnus could imagine that the fast growing from the baby wasn't good and prepared from the body from Alec and that made him even more worried.

"Sit down on the carpet and make yourself comfortable while I get some massage oil." He said and made his way already in the bathroom.
912 2018-12-25 21:12:36 I think I went on a bit of a sustainability theme this year, with all my siblings & mother getting reuseable cups, bag, bamboo toothbrush, organic palm oil free chocolate, a can of water & a copy of an inconvenient truth  #geography #christmas #Sustainability #climatechange
913 2018-12-25 21:12:30 Charge from burning oil, shiz
914 2018-12-25 21:12:07 I bought the beard oil on your recommendation. Fantastic stuff, wish I'd had it years ago!
915 2018-12-25 21:12:00 And you say this after oil touches $42? Very prescient. Check what I’ve been saying in January. Thats when you sell and sit on cash. Now is the time to start buying (slowly).
916 2018-12-25 21:11:32 Can’t find it! Only got albas oil 
917 2018-12-25 21:11:24 What is wrong with decreasing oil prices?
918 2018-12-25 21:11:08 The Cafe Mac Pizza of the day will be: soggy crust with sweet coconut oil and mushroom.

920 2018-12-25 21:10:33 With the oil accumulated from ALL the dishes? ... 
921 2018-12-25 21:10:30 Weird. I think for me the only thing I would miss is sausage meat stuffing, but I am sure that could be replaced easily. It's the texture and flavour. I love nut roast, and pigs in blankets are easily replaced. Roast potatoes just needs the right oil, groundnut oil perhaps.
922 2018-12-25 21:10:27 My aunt is sending me cbd oil for Christmas god bless her sweet heart
923 2018-12-25 21:10:05 Miracle oil from Pure Romance it works miracles:)

927 2018-12-25 21:09:40 No it’s not it’s THC oil
928 2018-12-25 21:09:30 Merry Christmas! Garlic olive oil made our dinner!
929 2018-12-25 21:09:28 Baba Yaga went away somewhere or other, so she poured oil on our hinges; but she gave me a drop of hers first, and asked,
930 2018-12-25 21:09:26 sooo my oil is leaking..
931 2018-12-25 21:09:23 Listened to #TheDaily on @wamu885, & totally lost my Christmas spirit, reliving how Bush, Sununu, oil & gas industry, & GOP together torpedoed our best chance to have actually gotten ahead of global #climatechange. All the death & destruction we face is on them.
932 2018-12-25 21:09:03 That’s really cool. I love grilled octopus with some virgin (sorry nicole) olive oil. But I don’t think I’d eat Egbert
933 2018-12-25 21:09:02 OOOH bby I would love that hot sexy gift I oil you all up and have my way with you 
934 2018-12-25 21:09:02 Yeah it's like you started digging, struck oil, and then set it all on fire.
935 2018-12-25 21:08:56 I do apologize dear Mr whalefact I did not mean to intervene with your ideals *sips whale oil*
936 2018-12-25 21:08:55 Yeah, I’ve read that. 

Wonder how many sick elderly folks are being forced to consume coconut oil right about now? 
937 2018-12-25 21:08:53 Most of them still follow him. I don't get it. He is like the snake oil salesmen.
938 2018-12-25 21:08:47 Good good. 

We dey oil the ground for you no shaking. When you come we’re here
939 2018-12-25 21:08:36 Gowon said Nigeria problem is not money, but what to spend it on. Our Trillions are lost because our leaders are scared to tackle the Oil majors on how much Oil they really lift and international Banks regarding how much they take as so called debt servicing.
940 2018-12-25 21:08:31 He’s made mistakes. I’m from B.C. lower mainland so we’re in the middle of the friction with Alberta over shipping bitumen. Albertans blame the Feds and us for choking their oil off. What’s  mystifying to me is why they didn’t build a refinery when oil was 100+ dollars a barrel
941 2018-12-25 21:08:30 No...
The pre rinse gets rid of most of the oil that's on the plates...

I won't lie I used to pack the dishes in their sub categories but it takes time and when someone comes along and drops off like a glass or soemthing after you're done with them then what mist happen?
942 2018-12-25 21:08:30 Oil rigs are staffed by men. I wonder what happens if you abandon them for 24 hours? I'm sure it'll be pretty to watch, from a safe distance.
943 2018-12-25 21:08:27 No Donald that is bullshit you are in those countries for many reasons which is way beyond your comprehension. Its better to fight terrorists on the other side of the world than in your own back yard. You have a trade surplus with many of those countries you are protecting & oil.

947 2018-12-25 21:07:35 So you don't think that all this regime change rubbish is to do with Oil, Gas and a Centralised Bank then. Like it has been since 60's
948 2018-12-25 21:07:18 Nobody pay taxes to the government for the income from outside of Iran. Don’t worry. The government uses the oil & other earth treasures for its goal.
949 2018-12-25 21:07:04 You spoke out loud all the time the oil price is too high when it is $60 +. Now it drops to $42 and the Dow drops to below 22000. Are you now happy for these results? You are not making American Great, you are making American Poor.
950 2018-12-25 21:06:52 United States does not need to call in Saudis to invest in this country’s oil industry.
951 2018-12-25 21:06:42 It’s more about layering your products than anything else. I’m using as I am right now and my hair loves it. 360 degree spray bottle with a little bit of almond oil, then as I am double cream thing, then add oil to your roots. After that, brush like there is no tomorrow
952 2018-12-25 21:06:32 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; You anoint my head with oil; my cup runs over.

953 2018-12-25 21:06:20 Every year the family does a @BravoTopChef quickfire challenge for Christmas Day. This year’s ingredient was sausage.

I think I’ve won w Andouille Sausage & Shimp Tacos w street corn, onion, tomato, Fuji apple, mint cooked in lime and tangerine juice with a touch of olive oil.
954 2018-12-25 21:06:19 So, it’s the by the grace of God those children are dying at the boarder? Or the stock market keeps dropping? Or protected land is being sectioned off for oil drilling and fracking? Wow, I don’t know what god you believe in, but I hope you find Jesus, soon
955 2018-12-25 21:06:05 I wish coconut oil did to my face what it does to my body skin.

Body skin lol. It's all one damn skin.

966 2018-12-25 21:03:55 This is to support their joints and overall functions (ie. Fish oil for brain function and memory loss)
967 2018-12-25 21:03:45 The province is very top heavy. Oil money is not working its way down. But, there is also the ingrained sense of entitlement.
968 2018-12-25 21:03:28 I got money in oil, akara 
969 2018-12-25 21:03:17 Just to add sir. 

It's an Investment firm, so we majorly deal on inflows (Local and intl wire transfer); we service Oil and gas, finance, automobile companies etc. 

And a select number of FMCGs.

We have a registered CBN license so we're fully regulated as well.

985 2018-12-25 21:00:01 Tesla drivers don’t ravage the country. Yellow vests rather switch to electric and don’t fear oil anymore. Insert green, local power and free yourselves of taxes too!
986 2018-12-25 20:59:59 Lol...but you know that's overly optimistic.

They need oil at c.$95 for them not to run a budget deficit, so it makes sense to deceive the world with $80 benchmark.

If this thing continues to fall, both of us (KSA and NG) will borrow like 'shege' come 2019.
987 2018-12-25 20:59:29 Try read this and actually thinking about it people right now are facing mass starvation under under communism in the modern day in a country that has oil one of the best natural resources economically speaking communism has once again FAILED to work in the REAL WORLD

992 2018-12-25 20:58:12 Housing bubble and oil dependency. Not good. Australia has a a bigger house bubble and bigger commodity reliance. Somehow iron ore has held up. Not much longer methinks.
993 2018-12-25 20:58:07 Exactly. I don’t claim to know how Venezuela would have faired once Chávez was gone, but I do know that it was intentionally driven to failure by our government - all because Chávez considered oil a natural resource that belonged to the people & not oil companies.
994 2018-12-25 20:58:07 Grabs packaging.....water, wheat gluten, soy protein isolate, wheat flour, evaporated cane sugar, sesame oil, red yeast rice powder, oleoresin paprika, vitamin and mineral blend, natural smoke flavour, autolyzed yeast extract, natural flavours (from vegetable sources).

YUM.  :(
995 2018-12-25 20:57:48 They wanted us to reliy heavily on fuel and oil. Let's replaced them with alternative resources
996 2018-12-25 20:57:44 Fox news highlights fossil fuel dilemma. Do you really think dinosaurs are supplying all that oil? Get real
997 2018-12-25 20:56:46 I just don’t think a Wall is enough, Donny. You gotta add a crocodile filled mote, and some vats of boiling oil to complete his apparently state of the art security system of the 1500’s.

1000 2018-12-25 20:56:20 There r lots of people who appreciate this futile solution. They might have seen in arabia or US. But we dont produce oil.
1001 2018-12-25 20:56:04 Oh. They're traditional in central Europe (germany, austria, Poland etc.). We're doing with with oil, honey and spices 
1002 2018-12-25 20:55:52 idk why my body decided coating my face in oil every few hours would be a good idea but it needs to stop, you should have stopped once summer was over WHAT ARE U DOING

1007 2018-12-25 20:54:51 Are climate deniers really evil, science haters, who love oil and are a threat to the greater good?

Of course not: some of them only love coal - 
1008 2018-12-25 20:54:49 But the fact that you look at medical advancements and technological advancements and think "Oh this is totally capitalism 100%"

Capitalism made factories spew smog and oil into rivers. Whippiee, the planet is so much better for it!!
1009 2018-12-25 20:54:48 And I’m going to say that good old fashioned sunflower oil gives you crispy fluffy potatoes whereas all these high falutin animal fats just make for balls of grease
1010 2018-12-25 20:54:46 The problem is the credit risk exposure on oil producers as oil plunges. It takes up more balance sheet to some banks that have deliberately built up these portfolio. So net net it reduces very marginally the velocity of money. One key exception is if banks or BHCs are involved.
1011 2018-12-25 20:54:39 Says a lot and your garden is getting too much chili oil ™.
1012 2018-12-25 20:54:36 My view on Yemen is it will not resolve until civilisation is not an oil junkie.

1014 2018-12-25 20:54:29 After using it for a while I can empirically say that I had my first disappointment with @aveda. Your pure-performance oil seriously lacked any performance. Cheaper pure oils made a difference in fraction of the time when yours didn’t after a long time. So disappointing.
1015 2018-12-25 20:54:22 Clear  is that in the contemplation and analysis of Olfactory Art the material aspects are of far greater importance than for visual art, where many won’t care about the chemical formula of the ultramarine blue pigment or if it was in oil or polyvinyl acetate resin.
1016 2018-12-25 20:54:08 Canadian dollar has been OP as f**k.  It's more or less ignored the impaled $oil price for 3 months.

A few years back the $usdcad dollar ramped North of 1.50 and some.

It has alot of catching up to do.

Oil is going to test its lows from back then.
1017 2018-12-25 20:53:51 Steve got an essential oil diffuser so WE got an essential oil diffuser
1018 2018-12-25 20:53:49 Cos you didn't get the oil contracts either
1019 2018-12-25 20:53:48 I think YOU REALIZE how BAD it would be for Texas to build a wall.  
Where would ranch hands & oil workers then come from?!?

1020 2018-12-25 20:53:47 My mom didnt change her oil right cause she was rushing so her fucking oil filter cap came off and all her oil came out and now shes throwing a fit and yelling at everyone and criticizing literally everything abt me and my car like wow maybe u shouldnt have fucked up huh?

1023 2018-12-25 20:53:19 Sell Potato future and then only grow it. Thats how miners do it. Thats how oil drillers do it. Save money on growing stuff which has no future value.
1024 2018-12-25 20:53:05 you just described systematic failure (also, banks take the long end of options in oil, correct..not vis a vis futures)
1025 2018-12-25 20:52:35 I’m eating oil rice lemme finish 
1026 2018-12-25 20:52:17 Yum! I made a tomato, mushroom, onion, green pepper sauce layered into gluten free lasagna noodles with mozzarella & cottage cheese, side salad greens topped with fresh zucchini spirals & yogurt, Dijon, mustard, orange juice, olive oil dressing~
1027 2018-12-25 20:51:49 I love what you’ve done with your limited space place. 

You may wish to reconsider the no showering regime though as it’ll mean you need to share your space with new and obnoxious germs and considerable levels of grease/oil from your hair.
1028 2018-12-25 20:51:48 Oil price looking at the 2019 budget recurrent expenditure is higher than the capital expenditure which is a bad signal to the economy.
1029 2018-12-25 20:51:27 ありあぶらさん
1030 2018-12-25 20:51:16 Except oil companies have never received subsidies.  The left calls IDC (intangible drilling cost) a subsidy but it’s not.  It’s no different than writing off any other cost of doing business.
1031 2018-12-25 20:51:01 Just what I want - Holy Oil  #supernatural
1032 2018-12-25 20:51:00 Apparently, @Kohls is out here selling used trimmers and clippers with other people's hair and oil already in them. Super embarrassing. Be safe out there. Wow. So disgusting...
1033 2018-12-25 20:50:35 I’m going to tweet the recipe.

You need
1 leg of lamb,
1 head of garlic
1 cup of white wine
1/4 cup of olive oil
1 cup water
Salt
Pepper
3 potatoes cut into rough wedges
(any other veggies you care to throw in - not traditional)
1034 2018-12-25 20:50:33 Better get some oil dry on that splatter
1035 2018-12-25 20:50:22 two tablespoons of oil on the internet is a nearly half cup.
1036 2018-12-25 20:50:02 You don’t make a country poorer while searching for technical solutions to climate breakdown. Corbyn is also an industrialist. He believes in state aid for industry. Not the solution to climate change, peak oil and population expansion.
1037 2018-12-25 20:49:57 Business sentiment in the local manufacturing sector weakened further in November on the back of a plunge in international crude oil prices.
1038 2018-12-25 20:49:51 Bought my mom a @TroyBilt self-propelled mower at @Lowes for Christmas. It came beautifully assembled in the box and with oil. Took it for a spin and mowed my mom’s lawn in less than an hour. Kudos to @TroyBilt for common sense and great design!
1039 2018-12-25 20:49:51 Ormana oil.
1040 2018-12-25 20:49:32 Ottawa and BC are giving it away already.  And note world oil demand just went over 100 mm bbls/d or 36.5 billion barrels/yr.  You will be back burning wood, coal and tires like India soon - we won’t be able to see you for the pollution!!
1041 2018-12-25 20:49:21 Hey, 20 different oil&gas executives gave Beto the maximum donation, so Beto is actually twice as bad as your candidate 2. Merry Christmas.
1042 2018-12-25 20:49:13 But really, I would collect weird antique jewelry. Rings with baby teeth, Victorian mourning pieces made of hair, Manos Figa, lockets shaped like tiny books with teeny oil paintings on every page. Gah.
1043 2018-12-25 20:49:11 Still 3 trading days left and I can’t find any reason to put money into this mess. Not one from shutdown to trade wars and Fat orange Nixon sitting in the White House screaming at his Tv! Forgot about the FED and the oil plunge ..
1044 2018-12-25 20:49:10 With crude oil trading for just over $50/gal, why am I being charged a $46 fuel/environmental fee by @WasteManagement on top of $126 for a 96 gal toter? Plus $15 in fees for recyclable offset and regulatory charges. What's the $126 for the toter cover? Seems like a #ripoff.
1045 2018-12-25 20:49:08 Divorcing ourselves from the Americans would do a world of good. On one hand their environmentalists meddle with our sovereign right to decide how and where we bring oil to market and on the other they price gouge us because there are no options.

1048 2018-12-25 20:49:02 You could be right...I can't see it beyond small transfers which will all be *back* to the Assad side. Possibly if they had a few more oil fields. I would say talks are ongoing though...
1049 2018-12-25 20:48:54 Uptop store for da best food shit was just oil no cap.
1050 2018-12-25 20:48:52 Do you have any context for this clip?
This is from 2003 at the grand opening of Luk oil.

It was shortly before this that US - Russia relations improveed following NATO-Russia council creation and G8 summit.

Russia wasn't just caught meddling with elections
1051 2018-12-25 20:48:46 U can’t fool us we know that’s motor oil. Either way looks good asf
1052 2018-12-25 20:48:45 Sorry to hear.  Worth mentioning, FECO (full extract cannabis oil), a.k.a. Rick Simpson Oil (RSO) consumed orally has repeatedly cured multiple types of cancer.

1054 2018-12-25 20:47:23 Most carts prob don’t get you high bc they’re probably the kinds where people are paying $30 for a gram cart, which is bullshit. Real carts are too expensive that’s why I just get wax. Dab pens that you load yourself should get you high tho if you get a good one with good oil.
1055 2018-12-25 20:47:20 My hair frizzes up really easily when untreated. Moisturizing shampoo + conditioner works best. I also use argon oil on my hair 2 a week to give it a softer, sleeker feel. ((I know i know. I hate the feel of oils too but it really helps! ))
1056 2018-12-25 20:47:17 Bro. I have a 12-pounder! Never made one! I stuffed it with some garlic, coated it with oil, rub of garlic and onion powder, thyme, rosemary, salt and pepper. I’m going with five minutes per pound at 500. Then sitting in an off oven for two hours! Godspeed!
1057 2018-12-25 20:47:16 Deadass the absolute worst. And don’t worry I’m on it, I’m making a new batch of coconut oil that is obnoxiously strong so I’ll just die lol
1058 2018-12-25 20:47:14 even at that, is not a Crime to project higher Oil price
Budget is only base on projection.
projecting $60 par barrel in oil price is not a problem
because even projecting $50, we may end up with $40 at the end of the day.

that is why is call BUDGET, expectation or projection

1063 2018-12-25 20:46:50 A Texas politician who is seeking national office damn sure needs to be scrutinized on their oil and gas voting record and financial support; if this hypothetical Texas congressperson wants to be president, their energy policy could be existentially relevant for human beings.
1064 2018-12-25 20:46:47 You are deeply deeply mistaken. 

Improper wastewater disposal causes earthquakes. 

Wastewater gets produced at oil sites too.

1089 2018-12-25 20:42:29 A 100-200bps reduction in risk-free rates should spur a rally in the bond market and make equities more attractive.

But we would need Oil at c. $60 to convince foreign investors.
1090 2018-12-25 20:42:09 Right, I can look in @Nigella_Lawson books certainly, but best suggestions for using cold smoked olive oil and black truffle olive oil (also got garlic and herb oil and chilli and pink pepper oil, but I know how I'll use those)?
1091 2018-12-25 20:42:02 Oil plunges 6 percent as economic slowdown fears grip market: Oil prices plunged more than 6 percent to the lowest level in more than a year on Monday, pulling back sharply late in the session as fears of an economic slowdown rattled the market.
1092 2018-12-25 20:41:39 Too much oil I think. Or else a bad culinary adviser....
1093 2018-12-25 20:41:33 It doesn't matter whether it's a Bill or an Act. Your oil futures for 2019 delivery are already being sold and bought at those contract prices currently on the ticker tape.

1102 2018-12-25 20:39:32 No they are not exempt, but they obtain better treatment than SMEs. In the electricity generation sector, coal receives more favourable treatment than oil and gas, which gets better treatment than renewables, hydro and nuclear.

Or go to Iceland ( shop) and it a quid for 20 pre made
1109 2018-12-25 20:38:25 The easy part of this is the technology.
The difficult part is getting our government to remove the barriers that are placed there by the #WMC who have vested interest in the oil industry and motor industry with their cohorts overseas.
Together they use SA as a dumping ground.
1110 2018-12-25 20:38:10 You're far more likely to contaminate ground water by pissing on the ground than drilling for natural gas at about ~1300 meters down. 

It's not really economically efficient to drill for oil any more than ~6 meters down. 

Water tables stop at about ~190 meters down.
1111 2018-12-25 20:38:10 Sure this snake oil salesman, real estate scammer, reality TV start, failed businessmen, dude who lied to avoid serving his country in Vietnam..

1136 2018-12-25 20:34:15 Yes, what can't take will destroy it. if you oil producing country must buy arms if you don't set you in war, or try to destroy you it is extortion.
1137 2018-12-25 20:33:57 #Fed What's behind Trump's attacks on Fed? Trump & advisors know the real economy is slowing rapidly in December '18 and 1st Qtr GDP also weakest & oil & commodity prices deflating. Trump is positioning himself to take credit for a Fed decision to halt rate hikes already planned.
1138 2018-12-25 20:33:56 And GSP if we’re calling out cheaters. GSP has grease gate where he was bathing in baby oil before fights so his skin would be to oily to hold on too.

SHAME ON GUYANA FOR NOT SHARING THE OIL, we have strayed too far from the meaning of Caribbean Community and it's simply atrocious, we must integrate more.

I would start with Helon Habila's 'Oil On Water'

And you?
1145 2018-12-25 20:32:37 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.

I rub it on the trouble spots consistently and stay patient. It works, try it. Also cut out sugar, dairy, gluten, and grains.

1153 2018-12-25 20:31:08 I can also say that SA sells its oil in $ & u know how it supports the $ and American economy.

1156 2018-12-25 20:30:53 Yep. Clearly oil markets see demand falling away in front of additional production potential out of the US which has basically become the world's swing producer. That potential 1.2m bpd increase that will, at new prices, never materialize is neutering OPEC.

1159 2018-12-25 20:30:34 his record on oil and gas as a TX rep makes sense; those industries employ many. The politicians who appear environmentally conscious may not be the boots on the ground we need and his voting record does not reflect what he would do to represent the nation.

1175 2018-12-25 20:27:22 So you have no idea what’s in it for the tax payer?   There’s nothing.  We are there because the Kurds have oil, that’s it.  That tax payer money is better spent in America.

1179 2018-12-25 20:26:13 I think the weakness is attributable to oil & financial stocks. Oil got smashed and that pushed l/t bonds yields down, got close to inversion on the yield curve and that demolished financials stocks. They are biggest weight in IWM.

1181 2018-12-25 20:25:33 My mom got me an essential oil defuser.....and it smells nice.
1182 2018-12-25 20:25:29 Ah! Since you’re in a piss mood anyway, what’s the big deal about some oil burning a little longer than expected?
1183 2018-12-25 20:25:24 Comprehensive reform being a panacea is a myth and dem talking point. The backlog I'd 5 mil + , 1.2 + enter legally every year. The idea your going to have an admittance rate high enough to end illegal entry is false. Could never be high enough realistically

I want to say I am happy to have you all in my life.
1186 2018-12-25 20:24:45 If by "respecting the result of the referendum" you mean respecting the will of the people, you should be aware that the will of the people has changed. We now know the solution we were sold two years ago was in fact snake oil. There is no better option than staying in the EU.
1187 2018-12-25 20:24:42 My problems with Sirota are more journalistic than ideological. This is his established MO. Throwing in donations from people who work in the oil industry as evidence that Beto is collecting petro dollars and is sympathetic to climate deniers is utter horseshit. We all know it.

For these dangerous and phisically demanding jobs i would wait for the men to return.

In the meantime, i would complain about men.

1239 2018-12-25 20:14:17 I boiled the marinade (ginger, garlic, sesame oil, gochujang, vinegar) with some honey. Poured it over ribs and cranked up the temp, put them in until the sauce began to re-caramelize, sprinkled with sesame seeds and scallions.
1240 2018-12-25 20:14:15 Democrats should check Beto's voting record. He votes with Republicans way too often and votes against climate and for oil and gas. So disturbing and discouraging.

1253 2018-12-25 20:12:25 We have a “photo opp” President.  No substance, no policy, no morals.  All flash no cash.  All talk no walk.  Big hat no cattle.  Trump is a snake oil salesmen.  His business experience is bankruptcy in a bad way. #MerryChristmasYaFilthyAnimal #HappyBirthdayJesus #AdultDayCare
1254 2018-12-25 20:12:21 I have kept saying that DJI performance is even MORE linked to oil right now. I have had 3 charts up for the last 3 weeks at all times... EU, CL, ES when trading during NYSE cash hours. 

Oil + FED = bad.
1255 2018-12-25 20:11:44 It's one piece just like ATVs , horses, SUV's, helicopters, fixed wing aircraft, boats, cameras , sensors, blimps, fences. 
Take any of these out of the equation and it weakens the overall efforts.

1281 2018-12-25 20:06:01 Me, preparing vegan mashed potatoes: olive oil, garlic, just a little bit of vegan butter to help everything cream up.  Tasty, spicy, maybe even healthy.

1284 2018-12-25 20:05:28 By this tweet, it suggests we should just open the border up and let everyone just pass through. In El Paso, some released said they were held 8 days. Over outrage center in Tornillo will be closed. Where will UAC's go then? Big prob, quit blaming us/ U.S
1285 2018-12-25 20:05:22 The US now produces as much oil as Russia and Saudi Arabia combined. If you want to look at reasons for low prices, look no further than the nation that helped the over supply situation. It's basic economics, over supply leads to low prices. Was, and will be, always thus.
1286 2018-12-25 20:05:21 Well, Brexit knowledge came in handy today. Playing a board game and was asked a question about olive oil production. Bingo!

Finally, a benefit for Brexit.

The return on investment in properties in the location is high.

As an experienced Realtor I'd be glad to assist you
1295 2018-12-25 20:03:50 I want to rub it so bad. I want to have you on a bed, naked with your bum in the air and your legs wide open so I can rub baby oil all over you and finger fuck you slowly, massaging your clit and licking your cheeks while I drive you to a huge orgasm.

1297 2018-12-25 20:03:07 How can we get Kratom? My blood pressure was constantly at 160/106. They prescribed their Pharma drug. It managed to bring my pressure down to abt 145/100. I started taking Hemp oil with very low THC. Has none of the effects, however it did bring my BP down to 122/90 within days.
1298 2018-12-25 20:03:06 I love the variety of work produced by Dmitry Kustanovich. His oil paintings are wonderful :)
1299 2018-12-25 20:02:53 Tea tree oil and sea salt soaks worked for me!
I would soak a cotton ball in warm salt water and just set it on the bump and then i would put diluted tea tree oil directly on the bump

1318 2018-12-25 20:00:53 It sent a VERY clear message.

Oil workers are making good use of those 13 billion a year they get in subsidies.
1319 2018-12-25 20:00:50 It's the Fed fault, they over stimulated the economy, loosened banking regs. loosened environmental laws, safety laws, and consumer protection laws, gave us the big tax scam , increased the national debt, and opened up public land and shore lines for mining and oil drilling,

1336 2018-12-25 19:57:38 What happens when our border is over run and we try and cope. ICE released btwn 600 and 700 in El Paso over last 3 days. Several hundred in Houston and likely elsewhere as well to make room for more. 
It's a sad tragedy but not BP or the country's fault.

1339 2018-12-25 19:57:05 So my husband brought me oil paints for Christmas. Opened the gift a few weeks ago. You would think for a second painting I would do something more typical. Nope. I'm trying to find images of classic supercells so I can paint storm clouds. :)
1340 2018-12-25 19:57:05 Don’t spoil argument - it’s simple - western intervention in Middle East has made things worse not better. They need to use the oil wealth to sort it themselves and engage with C21 rather than Middle Ages!

1348 2018-12-25 19:56:08 Oil price hit can't be explained by supply/demand. Feels like ZOPP zero oil price policy to save our fragile economy. It's what the State does (HFT manipulation of markets) to keep our "Weekend At Bernie's" economy alive at the expense of miners, farmers, oil producers, investors
1349 2018-12-25 19:55:47 Venezuela’s foreign ministry on Tuesday described as  “interventionist  and disrespectful” U.S. comments on a weekend incident in which the  country’s navy stopped two ships exploring for oil for Exxon Mobil off Guyana’s coast.
1350 2018-12-25 19:55:41 I guess my family was raised to know not to run near the hot pot of boiling oil. Granted between turkey frying and crawfish/crab boils these are common sense rules we grow up with in south Louisiana.

1357 2018-12-25 19:54:49 No shit pipelines aren't going to help Canada meet climate targets. The fact that @JustinTrudeau and the @liberal_party keep pushing pipelines and oil and gas bailouts in Alberta is absolutely insane.

However, he is not selling FORTE OIL, but, his personal shares (which is quite a lot-75%).

1390 2018-12-25 19:49:08 • Oil prices have dropped by almost 50% since October 2018.

1398 2018-12-25 19:48:10 There's a good case that staying in Syria doesn't even advance U.S. interests optimally.

Having Iran, Russia, Syria, etc. stuck in a quagmire, attempting to maximize their individual interests (oil), while re-building hundreds of billions in damage doesn't seem bad for the US.

1405 2018-12-25 19:46:22 Question for you. Every year the middle east sends us large quantities of there sarce oil and in return we send them little pieces of paper. Who is getting the deal, really?
1406 2018-12-25 19:46:05 Paper barrels are Enron-style prepay  agreements. Essentially an agreement by an equity owner to sell & repurchase (lease) the economic interest in oil. It is achieved via a tripartite agreement with an investment bank/swap dealer
1407 2018-12-25 19:46:01 If course she does...Dick sits on the board of Genie Energy LTD. That would secretly hurt her pocketbook if Syria stopped their oil exploration in the Golan Heights

1429 2018-12-25 19:42:19 In a default, banks have security over oil. ie the debt is convertible to oil. If it all the companies go tits up then the Fed can print $ via QE & exchange for the debt, so creating dollars convertible to oil. This is why the US dollar is now on the #OilStandard

I'm going to trust and hope Ms. Bottoms is better at mayoring than mac and cheesing.
1434 2018-12-25 19:41:12 So that'll be a 'No' then, ok let's make it easier, discounting our oil and gas reserves can you name another Country with our population that has our resources?

1441 2018-12-25 19:39:50 "Stagflation" is basically irrelevant concern. There are many reasons why your real economy could get fucked (end of North Sea oil, low prices of what you export, fucking up your country with Brexit etc.). Market monetarism just says to not pile up mass unemployment on top of it.
1442 2018-12-25 19:39:44 lanie is the only person that got me a present and she got me a huge box of oil paints i luv her
1443 2018-12-25 19:39:32 I don't quite understand the purpose of this entirely.. is the oil useable? Clearly it isn't being scooped up to clean up, just look at the surrounding mess! I feel for people stuck living in a 3rd world dump! Merry Christmas
1444 2018-12-25 19:39:31 Have you ever tried CBD oil and coconut oil?

1452 2018-12-25 19:38:40 Moving the U.S. to a 100-percent renewable electric grid may cost $5.2 trillion over two decades, according to a 2010 study by the conservative Heritage Foundation. That’s a lot cheaper than killing ourselves with coal, oil & gas.
1453 2018-12-25 19:38:39 One issue impacting  the decline in oil prices is the standard practice for companies to buy PUT options.

1456 2018-12-25 19:38:23 These protests were meant to meant to be and these would spread from sudan all the way till saudiarabia. Oil prices are beinf made to fall, prompting protests which would lead to capture of these countries. Many religious scholars were warning against this from a long time ago
1457 2018-12-25 19:37:45 Global warming hyperbole has reached a wall, the cause has reached its end because the people that push it refuse themselves to take the radical big steps they are trying to force on others. It really depicts they know there is no true green energy world, and the world needs oil
1458 2018-12-25 19:37:30 I'd give Falcon an oil change and some cookies
1459 2018-12-25 19:37:28 What about switching to fully sustainable palm oil?

1466 2018-12-25 19:36:27 Being in the Northeast, Christmas is a great excuse to get a bunch of people in my house so I don't have to rely on oil to heat my house for a day. Plus everyone brings alcohol and we don't talk politics!
1467 2018-12-25 19:36:24 I'm live-tweeting from my son's home in Del City.  He's cooking dinne, and then changing my oil!

1469 2018-12-25 19:35:57 Yup! Reheating them obvi. Throw them on a pan with a little oil and that’s it
1470 2018-12-25 19:35:51 Well, let's not all start to panic yet as #oil prices crash. If they continue after Q2 19 then, indeed, we r in trouble. By then, Shale producers will hv to realize that OPEC can't save them everytime. They hv to pressure Trump for a measure of protectionism (see Alberta). #OOTT
1471 2018-12-25 19:35:45 Exactly.  Maybe SA will get opec to embargo USA so they can pay their budget.  Trump is destroying oil industry.
1472 2018-12-25 19:35:27 But it's all worth because you belong to this unique planet-saving community. You can congratulate other fellow teslards while waiting in line to recharge your battery whith coal, and you can blame the oil multis and the shorts for all what's bad in this world.
1473 2018-12-25 19:35:11 I’m all for ending oil wars, as taxpayer I’m sick of paying for private security and land grabbing for the fossil fuel industry. But you can just stop , wipe our hands and say that’s it. Wanna see the economy crash in on us all? Because that’s what will happen, smart not fast

1475 2018-12-25 19:34:55 There were reports that Erdogan bought oil from ISIS, is that true?
1476 2018-12-25 19:34:52 Recording and analyzing a government official’s many different excuses and explanation isn’t justification...

1482 2018-12-25 19:33:49 Neither! They use non sustainable palm oil which is encouraging the destruction of thousands of acres of orangutan habitat!
1483 2018-12-25 19:33:40 Canada's energy policy is locked into a fossil fuel mindset.  These subsidies could turn Alberta into a renewal energy superpower, and create a lot more jobs than the oil sands.

So. She begins to cook. Sipping some of her whiskey.
1494 2018-12-25 19:31:07 Ok if you have to have it, try to get grass fed beef.  Use coconut flour as the "dredge", and cook the onions in olive oil and duck fat.  A little garlic helps.  Have over smashed cauliflower.   Rosemary thyme and pink peppercorns would make this actually to die for.

1529 2018-12-25 19:22:51 Oh look. Global oil prices drop,  not due to one Canadian province.  Thanks for cheap gas in Ontario.
1530 2018-12-25 19:22:40 it didn't happen, not coz Gaddefi was a decent ruler
the country wasnt this divided between tribes coz Gaddefi had his ways of bribing them to restore "peace" thro oil.. while the rest of the people were starving
there was no terrorism & not nearly as many illegal immigrants
1531 2018-12-25 19:22:36 @theresa_may Wishing all happy Biafra and prosperous Biafra freedom from British murderous oversea territory lower niger company call Nigeria, Biafra oil is the soul economic survival of the criminal British Gov. refuse Biafra freedom watch ur Nigeria explode
1532 2018-12-25 19:22:24 No one is telling to like the man, but to understand the U.S. didnt do it because he is dictator, but because of money.same thing with the middle East, they claimed there was nuclear bombs there, which to this day are nowhere to be found, when everyone knows it was because of oil
1533 2018-12-25 19:22:15 Castor oil.. 
1534 2018-12-25 19:22:12 I got essential oil jewelry as a gift and don’t get me wrong, I’m super thankful. It’s just that everytime I move and smell rosemary, I get super hungry for steak.

1538 2018-12-25 19:21:01 Great looking family Merry Christmas from West Texas oil field
1539 2018-12-25 19:20:46 Try to be calm
1540 2018-12-25 19:20:40 I suspect the keyest of the key players is missing from this list. The Internet Research Agency and V. Putin. While the players noted are key in forming the message of denialism, it is the amplification of said message by bots and trolls that will keep Oil/Gas flowing out of RU.
1541 2018-12-25 19:20:36 I first became convinced of Erdogan's culpability more than five years ago.  He and his son Bilal were making millions buying stolen oil from ISIS and operating several holes in the border for ingress and egress of terrorist.  He supplied ISIS and AQ with train loads of supplies.
1542 2018-12-25 19:20:34 My adopted family in California had sent homemade biscotti to go with my morning coffee, along with a can of olive oil and balsamic vinegar to dip my evening bread into.
1543 2018-12-25 19:20:00 If I had to guess she just got an oil change and they spilled the oil all over the engine and once it got to operating temperature it caught on fire
1544 2018-12-25 19:19:51 one of the best Christmas gifts I’ve gotten this year was a gallon of oil, a new filter AND new spark plugs. Time for an oil change and a tune up  #whosaidwomendonttakecareoftheircars

1546 2018-12-25 19:19:47 Christmas gift! Sweet! Beard oil from #youngliving @manlihood
1547 2018-12-25 19:18:58 It's beautiful. Hope no oil drilling! You really should be in DC getting this mess fixed, not skiing. So many people are suffering while you're having fun and getting paid for it.

1549 2018-12-25 19:18:46 Noble thoughts and ideas that sadly have no basis in reality. The US military acts as an arm of big oil and weapons manufacturers. The ‘we’re there to protect and save lives’ is classic war machine propaganda. Dark US forces destabilize countries as a pretense for regime change.
1550 2018-12-25 19:18:45 I received a striped oil plug for Christmas. Yay.
1551 2018-12-25 19:18:37 In terms of oil, gas and renewable energy no. Scotland sells to rUK what they don't use.

1554 2018-12-25 19:18:24 We need to support companies that are using sustainable palm oil! It will be near impossible to remove palm oil from every product a consumer uses and it will put millions out of jobs. Sustainable palm oil will provide a future for everyone!
1555 2018-12-25 19:18:23 $NHPI / $WDBG remember the company and @michael01884562 have brought back a lot of shares... They retiring them will reduce OS by a HUGE, HUGE percent, making NASDAQ dream happen ANY MINUTE.. Forget not the Oil money from Duabi, Abu Dhabi and UAE....

1558 2018-12-25 19:17:51 .@chigrl seriously, is the decline in $CL driven more so by over production or a dive in demand? Can you show a measure of these data points. 

Oil seeems to be leading the markets and #FOMC policy due to the correlation to inflation.

1561 2018-12-25 19:17:08 Chef McElroy cut up some carrots, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was some live hornets, along with cheese.
1562 2018-12-25 19:17:05 Thanks Greg, shimmering hot oil before you pour the mix in, oven at 230 degrees and don’t open the oven door until they’re done.
1563 2018-12-25 19:17:03 That’s how I spilled all of my perfume oil! 
1564 2018-12-25 19:17:03 Mixing logic with a Dem argument is like trying to mix oil and water.
1565 2018-12-25 19:16:59 For an extra dose of goodness today, try coconut oil bowls and carry a chunk of amethyst with you in your purse.
1566 2018-12-25 19:16:44 Trade of year through Q3 was long oil / short NG. That blew up after Saudi ramped exports to US to help Trump in midterms. Misplaced global growth scare due to oversized drop in crude prices which made people wonder about fundamentals.
1567 2018-12-25 19:16:19 We need to support companies that use sustainable palm oil, not remove it altogether!
1568 2018-12-25 19:16:18 Crazy. The fish will poop in the mineral oil though.
1569 2018-12-25 19:16:13 i bought a whole bottle of tea tree oil and now i can’t find it
1570 2018-12-25 19:16:10 Its disingenuous because the facts were presented in a way to give the appearance of O'Rourke taking money from big oil, when he only accepted money from individual EEs.

Workers have the right to personally contribute to any politician they see fit.
1571 2018-12-25 19:16:07 Canary in the coal mine: Gold. Oil. Steel. Aluminum.  VIX. Fed’s stance on rates. yield curve. Global Politics. That’s all!
1572 2018-12-25 19:16:05 So the gifts happened.. Lots of cool stuff including the toothbrush and socks I was hoping for. Got some new tools, some cannabis oil, shatter, and a bag of pot! New PJs and an awesome sweater. Dad bought everyone a tin of toffee so can use the tin for 'your stash' lol

1576 2018-12-25 19:15:18 Bought father-in-law some beard oil for Christmas, but of course I’d forgotten that by the time he thrust his chin in my face and told me to smell it.
1577 2018-12-25 19:15:03 If you like a lot of sesame oil on your mille-feuille, join our club!
1578 2018-12-25 19:15:01 If trump gets one thing he insists on...like a certain amt of land for the oil or mining companies to destroy, he TAKES MORE & keeps on taking everything he wants w/no one to control him. He makes an inch into a million sq miles! Some ppl don't stop to realize that!
1579 2018-12-25 19:14:55 Ese gan Egbon. More power to u ma. More oil.
1580 2018-12-25 19:14:47 The amount of oil/butter helps. The onions release their liquid and it just kind of boils down into a hoop. (And if it turns out caramelized? Still tasty!)
1581 2018-12-25 19:14:39 @ACMATCO on of projects company is proud of is executing HVAC system for king Abdullah Research center of oil in Ryadh.      من الاعمال التي تفخر بها الشركة تنفيذ اعمال التكييف  لمدينة الملك عبدالله لبحوث البترول بالرياض
1582 2018-12-25 19:14:19 Here is a real problem few are discussing about US oil: When oil companies hedge (short), banks take the long side of that bet. Same banks also issue loans to keep these companies afloat, meaning they are highly overleveraged in oil debt. 1/3
1583 2018-12-25 19:14:17 I thought that "Burning the Midnight Oil" was a huge hit single from a band based in Austrailia. Today I learned that I am incorrect and there is no origination to this saying... Merry Christmas everyone!!!
1584 2018-12-25 19:14:11 Anybody have any experience w/ non-THC CBD oil? Specifically, does it really help with pain? Other benefits?
1585 2018-12-25 19:14:08 Well, we sure the heck know the Non-Tesla car companies were NOT going to try this first. I think it goes something like, "Short Electric, long oil."
1586 2018-12-25 19:14:04 Cauliflower Soup

In a dutch oven pot (or heavy pot), heat olive oil over medium heat. Add onion and garlic. cook until softened, about 5 minutes.
Add cut up cauliflower and vegetable broth. Bring to a boil then cover and simmer for 15-20 minutes until cauliflower is softened.
1587 2018-12-25 19:13:57 Remember Libya is oil rich and they couldn't get it from The Brother leader, Colonel Muammar Gadaffi. Also remember that even the IMF & World Bank had no hold on him hence they made him a monster they sold to the world. They called him a dictator but nothing about Museveni
1588 2018-12-25 19:13:18 You may be right federal infrastructure funding could have been used to help pay for ship yards and roads to import oil. Infrastructure funding not included in transfer payments. For the west to be heard irrational arguments do not help our cause. Research & learn before ranting
1589 2018-12-25 19:12:57 Merry Christmas everyone. A call to a Hydraulic oil leak on our ALP this morning, leak repaired and tested, homeward bound then my van went defective, loss of power, of all days for this to happen, managed to have my Christmas lunch, so everything is now good.

1595 2018-12-25 19:11:50 Owners of predatory companies like this need to be slowly immersed in a vat of boiling oil.
1596 2018-12-25 19:11:50 I was today's years old when I found out that people actually add salt on their potatoes (fries) before they put them in the frying pan.
Look, this guy just threw these in the oil that's not even on the stove
1597 2018-12-25 19:11:46 My hubs uses CBD oil for neurological pain. He hates the way drugs like ultram make him feel. Other meds he takes don’t allow use of anti-inflammatory meds.

1601 2018-12-25 19:11:20 Ignorant, narrow view. We're facing catastrophic effects from climate change. The last thing we need is a centrist bound to big oil. And he's not a progressive. That's the point.
1602 2018-12-25 19:11:06 Naw. Its Beto..considering the "oil donations" came from normal people that just happen to work for the oil industry.

1629 2018-12-25 19:06:33 Well, sort of! Neighbours have offered their shower and I have a wood burner and electric heaters. Washing up a bit tricky but we do have a dishwasher! Emailed the oil co this morning and they replied within the hour! They will do what they can! X
1630 2018-12-25 19:06:32 There's a fairly strong movement afoot to leave ALL fossil fuels in the ground. Coal, oil, natural gas, all of it. It would totally ruin world markets, cost billions of damage to economies, and put nearly a million people out of work.
1631 2018-12-25 19:06:31 A recent study in Norway used Krill oil, and the patients became much better. Even the doctors were blown away. Krill oil is made from small crustaceans called krill instead of fish, an omega-3 supplement. I would definitely check it out! Good luck!
1632 2018-12-25 19:06:28 no I'm sure someone quite literally paid to support oil companies is taking a broad, general view of things, and they're definitely less biased than climate scientists in the pocket of Big Ecological Diversity
1633 2018-12-25 19:06:11 He won't. Don't forget, Rafael once closed the government down too. He is a spineless traitor who serves the minority of rich white Texans vested in oil.

1635 2018-12-25 19:05:42 I think you misunderstand who is the legal owner of land and who purchases oil and refines it. QC is saying they will not approve the building permits in their jurisdiction  to construct the pipeline. The QC gov’t does not buy oil to refine. Oil bought from AB, USA, & Algeria

1647 2018-12-25 19:02:50 Speaking as a "nonessential," it doesn't exactly mean what you think it means. It really means those that a mission can do without for a period of time. An engine can run for a short time without oil--but will seize and no longer function without it eventually. Same principle.

1678 2018-12-25 18:58:22 Younger skins are better quality, as Oil of Olay likes to remind us. Kid/lamb similar w/ preference dependent on prep methods & writing tools used. Other factors include availability of species and/or other potential requirements for adult flock/herd i.e. (wool/milk) etc
1679 2018-12-25 18:57:57 Yup Olive Oil
1680 2018-12-25 18:57:55 Our family take (including pets) CBD oil twice a day to reach optimal health. CBD oil has so many health benefits.  We are now finding out new "water soluble" CBD oil and are very excited to try one. I am ordering one today! Have a nice rest of the week.
1681 2018-12-25 18:57:47 When the arrived to the desired aisle, Fawn reached out to grab the bag of dry ingredients. She then grabbed some mini chocolate chips. 

She assumed there would be eggs and oil at Averie’s place, so she didn’t bother getting those ingredients.
1682 2018-12-25 18:57:31 I’m guessing you only read the headline, checked your confirmation bias, then exclaimed “OWNED!” If you read the Forbes article you would see the Bloomberg article misused the word oil instead of petroleum. But since Bloomberg is a lefty it’s not surprising he printed #FakeNews!
1683 2018-12-25 18:56:49 Only if you get it with truffle oil.
1684 2018-12-25 18:56:44 My aunt brought over her CBD oil and I've been vaping up a storm since dinner. Between that and the wine its been a successful Xmas
1685 2018-12-25 18:56:41 Greenpeace wants to cripple the economy under false pretenses. there is no man made global warming. Coal/Oil are not made from fossils. They have however helped lift millions out of poverty. this last one is the real reason Greenpeace is against it.
1686 2018-12-25 18:55:49 Plus you forgot the Obama war on coal that was brought to us by the Saudi Oil industry
1687 2018-12-25 18:55:33 Not at all lad, just had a belter cooked in cannabis oil. Power, an all for £1.60 all in for 3 of us, fuckin boss that, merry tuesday
1688 2018-12-25 18:55:30 Bless you. Lavender oil is good for burns. Hope it heals soon but the meal looks amazing
1689 2018-12-25 18:55:27 I just met a male recently who said he would not let his daughters even drive a car until they could charge a dead battery, change the oil, AND change a flat tire without the assistance of a male. You know why?
1690 2018-12-25 18:55:24 I got some oil paint for Christmas and my nigga I am pumped!!!
1691 2018-12-25 18:55:24 Rethinking money from a commodity like oil to a public utility like education or firefighting is revolutionary and it's not surprising that people either try to reinvent the wheel or engage in outright denial.
1692 2018-12-25 18:55:04 I got a weighted blanket and cbd oil for Christmas, is my family trying to tell me something ??
1693 2018-12-25 18:54:42 Interestingly Edsels were plagued with problems as well - oil leaks, sticking hoods, trunks that wouldn't open, buttons that wouldn't push, a dashboard said to have burst into flames, bad paint, inferior sheet metal, doors cockeyed, springs that sagged!
1694 2018-12-25 18:54:36 My mother in law is visiting from Spain . She insists the heating is on high 24/7 . She also has a separate oil heater in her room . I’ve just cooked Christmas dinner in a Christmas jumper . Not all of us will make it out alive !

1696 2018-12-25 18:54:16 This is a bad take
1. Locations in movies aren’t selected for the veracity of travel time between sets
2. Maybe he was
3. Kevin slept alone in the attic
4. She did an accurate head count (neighborhood kid). Lots of blame to go around 
5. Furnace fuel is not identified, likely oil
1697 2018-12-25 18:54:13 Yeah,  II got into it w/ @davidsirota 's twitter trolls/Russian assets yesterday. 
They contend that anybody who earns a living via the oil/gas industry cannot be committed to climate action. 
This enraged me to the point of removing twitter from my phone.

Not confident enough to use a straight razor. 

I oil my scalp after every shave and wash.

1702 2018-12-25 18:53:10 Dont you think oil should head upwards? : unexistent capex spending over last years in unconventional production, fracking business burning cash and still alive thanks too wall street injecting money. Under 70$ most producers loose money
1703 2018-12-25 18:52:48 Can't be soon enough..but you'll still be begging for rights to move your dirty oil across the rest of the country!!
1704 2018-12-25 18:52:46 Coconut oil! I mix lavender essential oil in it too to make it smell better.. you only need a little bit and it doesn’t make your skin oily
1705 2018-12-25 18:52:39 tea tree oil smells ugh
1706 2018-12-25 18:52:21 I mean yeah they wash those oil covered ducklings off with Dawn dish soap, but does anyone really think they just picked up an oily duck from somewhere or did they dump oil on it just to wash it back off...

Anyway, Merry Christmas.
1707 2018-12-25 18:52:06 We learned back in WW2 tht wars bring lots of $: WW2 brought us out of the depression; war also has cost us a lot with the never ending war in the sandbox, that also got Russia, in the same regards

Once we got control of the gold, oil, and drugs they got greedy and wldn't leave
1708 2018-12-25 18:51:50 Time's relative kuttiamma meaning if yr happy time flies, when yr with a lover an hour feels like a minute, when a hot oil drop falls on you a minute feels like an hour ergo, the happy person and the miserable frock both will reach 100 .. lol

1711 2018-12-25 18:51:10 This is so false. Neem Oil and Bug Be Gone is a growers best friend.
1712 2018-12-25 18:51:06 My grandpa forgot the term “snake oil” so instead he said “serpent juice” 

y’all i just
1713 2018-12-25 18:51:04 Flowers should be everywhere, especially in overwhelmed feelings. Massage neroli oil into your unfelt emotions.
1714 2018-12-25 18:51:01 Try castor oil mixed with coconut oil
1715 2018-12-25 18:51:01 And the fact is lot of jobs that are hard AF, still require education, training, and degrees.  Look at any oil rig... it's not all roughnecks. There's a lot of STEM degrees.  And yet men dominate the STEM degrees as well. Why?  Women are not prevented from studying STEM.
1716 2018-12-25 18:50:51 I think there's something to be said for this. As a then young Boomer, I always wondered about the ussr's leap ahead of ours with sputnik

There's also at least one other phenomenon, I think, & it's how fluidly inventors or entrepreneurs can operate - regardless of system.
1717 2018-12-25 18:50:50 Castor oil and brush your face. Stimulates the hair follicles. Mines finally growing
1718 2018-12-25 18:50:40 Haitian black castor oil > Jamaican black castor oil. Argue with anyone who isn’t me.
1719 2018-12-25 18:50:33 Me having mature and sensitive skin...if I have something that isn't coming off with a makeup remover I will take some coconut oil...melt it between my fingers...rub it on and just let it "sit" for 5 mins or so THEN wash my face and that usually does the trick!
1720 2018-12-25 18:50:16 That might be why you had low oil pressure 
1721 2018-12-25 18:50:13 Do you think Oil is worth investing in? #investing #stocks
1722 2018-12-25 18:49:54 I agree Shaun,  for example I got uncomfortable about counting money from people working in oil and gas companies on the same level as PAC
1723 2018-12-25 18:49:54 I don't know if it'll help with the vomiting, but using tea tree oil scent calmed him down as well to where the vomiting wasn't constant.
1724 2018-12-25 18:49:07 make sure the skin is super dry going in, lots of olive oil and salt rubbed in and roast on full for half an hour then turn down the heat for 2.5/3 hrs

As a youth I substituted olive oil for corn syrup in some kind of dessert, I'll never forget the dismay on mom's face when she bit into it
1732 2018-12-25 18:47:24 The congress even bought oil from Arab countries on loan and promised to repay it later. Modi successfully cleared all the pending loans and also negotiated a good deal for our country.
Had congress done something good for the country, India would have been much ahead.

1735 2018-12-25 18:46:55 2. Try to resist popping your pimples and touching your skin. It can cause inflammation and even scars! Instead, apply tea tree oil or witch hazel to reduce redness and irritation.
1736 2018-12-25 18:46:45 The workers effected by shutdown are considered "nonessential". If they are "nonessential", they should get jobs elsewhere. You say CO has propane gas problem. Well, it comes from drilling for oil and gas. You wan that stopped. Also, some medications are derived from drilling.

1751 2018-12-25 18:42:57 What he's not telling you is hes agreed to let the oil prices go through the roof to pay for it
1752 2018-12-25 18:42:56 I'm having wild salmon cooked in coconut oil with spring onions and grated ginger + rice & broccoli. It's dead easy and fish can be substituted by anything if you're not a failed veggie like me #joinin

1754 2018-12-25 18:42:28 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
1755 2018-12-25 18:41:58 The work for people and money is the hook. We all remember the days of 4 barrels of water per barrel of oil. Now we have the FN fighting each other for work and money at the expense of their past and future rights. It was the Federal/Provincial Governments controlled by ?

1760 2018-12-25 18:40:57 Ok. I’ll use some olive oil as family member can’t have butter.
1761 2018-12-25 18:40:56 America has oil so I'm not sure why America hasn't invaded yet to do a "regime change".
1762 2018-12-25 18:40:52 You are allowed. And I’m open to hearing arguments for limiting large individual donations from execs in other industries too. In this case, he signed a pledge agreeing not to take donations over $200 from oil and gas employees
1763 2018-12-25 18:40:49 There are more than 6,000 products that are made from the chemicals manufactured from crude oil that renewables wind and solar cannot manufacture.

1778 2018-12-25 18:38:30 2) I haven't worked for the oil and gas industry in decades. However, further scrutiny of Beto's donations showed that some were given in rather large chunks. I'm suspicious of that. Doesn't seem like small, individual donations.

1782 2018-12-25 18:38:07 IRAN, I'd take their leaders out the next time they meet together which is once a year. Then blowup all of Iran's nuclear research centers & all of their military, then put sanctions on their OIL. FACT: You have to kill THE enemy! Japan only stopped after they were Nuked! FACT!
1783 2018-12-25 18:37:27 But also, individuals doing everything you can to reduce your carbon footprint will do nothing on the long run because big oil and farming are most of the problem and we are fucked anyways. Happy holidays

1791 2018-12-25 18:35:48 Possible for oil to rebound mid $60’s in q1/q2 2019?
1792 2018-12-25 18:35:43 True, especially for 419s. Many millionaires without known businesses, private jets everywhere, good business times for China, Thailand etc , while our people were made lazy, and to depend on abroad for even tooth pick. Sell oil and import economy. PDP model economy, rogues
1793 2018-12-25 18:35:41 But your relatives are delicious with olive oil and salt and pepper... their noble sacrifice will not go unforgotten!

1808 2018-12-25 18:34:05 Really trying to convince my family to let my grandma use CBD oil for her pain, is there any place in SA that has it?

1810 2018-12-25 18:33:53 I assume this means you don't feel we should help poor or small nations deal with the impacts.  Ok, I get that part.

But, There's no counter cabal to Oil n Gas.  Not like you describe.

As for taxes, our failures to tax wealth have already transferred our citizens' wealth away.
1811 2018-12-25 18:33:49 First set of money I get in my hand, I have to go get an oil change. When I was 18, Christmas money went toward clothes 
1812 2018-12-25 18:33:30 What will last barrel of oil cost?
1813 2018-12-25 18:33:28 We can do much better than a red state oil Democrat who voted along with the GOP to help Trump build a deportation force. I don’t give a rat’s a** if Beto speaks Spanish or not, Latinos ain’t gonna let that fly.
1814 2018-12-25 18:33:19 Maybe try arnica oil? Or some kind of arnica based creme. It’s excellent in helping to speed up the healing process. Then use Vaseline over the top. That will help to create an occlusive barrier so the arnica can penetrate and work more effectively. I’m sorry this is happening!

1847 2018-12-25 18:27:47 You’re so full of shit Senator. Oil prices are the lowest they’ve been in years. Anyone with 1/2 a brain knows that oil drives inflation. Consequently, the Fed shouldn’t be raising rates since rate increases are for the purpose of controlling inflation.

1849 2018-12-25 18:27:41 DID YOU KNOW? Qatar will be ending its 57 years of OPEC membership in January of 2019. The impact of this on the oil cartel may not be significant however, as Qatar represents just 2% of OPEC’s total oil production (600,000 bpd).

1860 2018-12-25 18:25:26 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
1861 2018-12-25 18:25:25 Curious how much of that #natgas selloff yesterday was driven by margin calls on oil and equities? BTW, GFS is always ridiculous in the way it over-amplifies forecasts of MJO phase 7 - ECMWF is also getting there, albeit a bit more realistically.
1862 2018-12-25 18:25:09 We should give him Christmas gifts. Many many lumps of coal and a quart of Oil sands oil from every Canadian. That's what he deserves.  He is so stupid that he will probably think that Canadians loves him so much, they sending him all these gifts. What a little moron.

1872 2018-12-25 18:23:22 If it's any help I use glycerin soap and that removes my makeup and cleanses my skin really well. I use tea tree oil to moisturize + essence and then finish it off with a serum

1890 2018-12-25 18:18:44 I have had dozens of people explain all the miraculous supposed effects and uses of CBD oil to me but not one has explained exactly how it is not just snake oil.
1891 2018-12-25 18:18:43 Wouldn't need tontake the stuff with us. As there would be no one to create electricity, drill oil, or even refine it.
1892 2018-12-25 18:18:36 Hyperinflation will damage the USA more than any war. Get ready for a civil war perhaps. Keep watching who's dumping the dollar for oil trading.
1893 2018-12-25 18:18:27 Belarus was importing huge amount of duty-free oil (much bigger than their internal consumption) and then re-exported it raw or refined to other countries making hefty profit in the process. That, and subsidized price for gas and weapons.
1894 2018-12-25 18:18:18 Alberta is pretty damned Texas. They have cows, oil, and Dairy Queen.
1895 2018-12-25 18:18:00 No Christmas breather for oil lol

1899 2018-12-25 18:16:38 Jesus, your getting into the minutiae now. The aim is, as far as I’m aware, renewables and were doing pretty well. I think I’m a realist, we need oil and gas for the foreseeable future, it’s too valuable a commodity to ignore, the money can be used to further enhance renewables
1900 2018-12-25 18:16:31 can’t believe all it took to get rid of my blackheads was to just start oil cleansing

1909 2018-12-25 18:14:05 welp, olive oil has a low smoke point and roasted potatoes have a high cooking temp
1910 2018-12-25 18:14:03 Absolutely hilarious. You had a pro-active ideologue attack us because he hated our superior culture- a Saudi national whose "network " was funded, organized and radicalized by Saudi fundamentalists. Leave them to their backward tendencies.  Don't buy their oil, marginalize them.
1911 2018-12-25 18:13:56 Yep, thought of that already. Part of me thinks it’s the thought that counts, but as usual there is no thought  last year I got a 250ml bottle of olive oil from Asda haha, what I buy on my weekly shop!! Very bizarre. And they are NOT short of cash (not that it’s about £££!!)

1913 2018-12-25 18:13:36 If that's the case, why say Scotland will be powered by renewables? Or will we just sell the oil and let other people pollute the plant. Where are all the electric vehicles? The diesel pollution in Glasgow, Perth and Dundee is horrendous.
1914 2018-12-25 18:13:21 Accidentally made the best roast potatoes in the whole world today. Turns out if you par boil & drain them, leave them on the side for a couple of hours, whilst you go & sing to the old people, fling & toss them in hot oil & ignore them in the oven for 50 mins, they are amazing
1915 2018-12-25 18:13:19 Even the oil industry knows AGW is real
1916 2018-12-25 18:13:15 Yet according to the New Scientist November 17th 2018 oil consumption is set to continue rise with India doubling energy needs and China still holding its position as the main global oil consumer.
1917 2018-12-25 18:13:08 In winters try heating the oil and applying it with a piece of cotton. I used to do that when I lived in a place with actual winter

1919 2018-12-25 18:12:41 How Big Oil Conquered the World
1920 2018-12-25 18:12:34 Did you know that home heating oil tanks can vary in size from 275 gallons to over 1,000 gallons? Basically, the size of the tank is going to be dependent on several factors, including the age of the house, the size of the house, and the homeowner’s personal oil consumption.
1921 2018-12-25 18:12:24 Diffuse oil
1922 2018-12-25 18:12:17 It is also interesting to note that it was likely Standard Oil who was behind the assassination of Louisiana Senator Huey Long.

1930 2018-12-25 18:10:57 Anyone remember Venezuela being one of our major oil partners until we sabotaged it because we didn't like their president Hugo Chavez? And now Russia has control of western hemisphere oil fields with a lien on a major US oil retailer? Was that part of the Helsinki agreement?

1942 2018-12-25 18:08:28 Thursday was a down day for the broad U.S. markets. Each of the major exchanges turned lower in the session, putting the Dow and S&P 500 on track for their worst December since 1931. Crude oil posted another big loss on the day dipping even further below $50..
1943 2018-12-25 18:08:09 mom gave me one of those fancy essential oil diffusers idk what to even do with it
1944 2018-12-25 18:07:51 all of my poetry books have coconut oil stained pages or fingerprints. because i drench myself in coconut oil and slip on my robe and i read for hours lol
1945 2018-12-25 18:07:43 It’s time to take profit from 58$ and time to buy some oil!!
1946 2018-12-25 18:07:41 Good morning Merry Christmas If anyone wants to get me an oil change + two new tires for Christmas simply secret Santa it Through Cash App it’s an easy $400.00 $DinaNtyce
1947 2018-12-25 18:07:40 I'm lazy to oil in winters. It takes too long to get it all out  I do oil in summer though. But yeah, my hair growth rate is super slow. 

If this is another thing you can do better than He then what's the other(s)?????
1948 2018-12-25 18:07:28 My theory on what happened in Q4

Nat Gas shock wreck a few big hedge funds. They lost and brought down gross leverage. Still spilled over into oil given elevated positioning. This weighed on BEI & helped trigger a short squeeze in rates that inverted the curve.
1949 2018-12-25 18:06:42 This is why data is the new oil :).
1950 2018-12-25 18:06:39 Blunt?! Ok Beto is another slick talking snake oil salesmen bait and switch Obama establishment cuck who puts profit before the people and exactly what Dems need to guarantee Trump another 4yrs.  Dems would rather loose with anyone than win with Bernie. And get paid to do so.
1951 2018-12-25 18:06:30 Had them going off, when I was trying to make roast potaties after my mum had failed at par billing them! If its have shuck them to rough them up, it would have turned into mashed potatoes! Had to heat the oil so hot - 250 degrees to roast them! Beep beep beep beep! Haha! 
1952 2018-12-25 18:06:23 Anointing oil
1953 2018-12-25 18:06:17 Depending how tough she fwy you will see oil TREE sides but trust me sometimes it’s not good to see em 
1954 2018-12-25 18:06:10 And somehow Thump will rule it illegal, cuz his oil buddies won't get their cut.
1955 2018-12-25 18:06:04 โอเค ขอฟัง snake oil
1956 2018-12-25 18:06:01 Otedola trying to sell shares of forte oil, is an attempt to cause panic..
An inevitable depreciation in the value of crude oil...
1957 2018-12-25 18:05:55 เหมาหมดเลยได้ป่าว
1958 2018-12-25 18:05:40 My mother, the same one who made me throw away my bowl when I was 17 just gifted me an entire bottle of CBD oil.
1959 2018-12-25 18:05:28 And we wonder why the people of that part of the world not only don't trust us but hate us we can't even keep our word with the ones who always truly have our backs. If only they had some oil then we would proabaly have theirs.
1960 2018-12-25 18:05:25 I think I am finally going to start taking Cod Liver Oil and the likes I can hold my nose while I down that shit

Bravokeep going..
1964 2018-12-25 18:04:32 Weird flex but that’s another thing I can do better than Donghae. :p I coloured my hair so I can see how much it has grown from the roots. Hair oil really really helps
1965 2018-12-25 18:04:23 So is oil company pacs.  Progressives agree a lot.  On Alex and Bernie platforms, I don't think we need to abolish ice but I don't mind.  Greens, fine with it all.
1966 2018-12-25 18:03:53 an expired blue moon and a hit of oil makes any novena lit
1967 2018-12-25 18:03:43 Merry Christmas, Meeshared. Fracking provides access to vast new oil/NG reserves, lower taxes, local employment, reduced dependence on foreign energy, better air quality, reduced exploration, smaller surface footprint. Yes, water is an issue that's improving. Quakes figured out.
1968 2018-12-25 18:03:31 What about tariffs? And drivi g down oil prices? Did Powell do that? Those have a much greater effect than Interest rates rising. Trump hasn’t done a thing to help the market this year, and is causing it to tank because he is doing the exact opposite of what would help the market

1970 2018-12-25 18:02:59 If you speak to CEO's, talk to different ones which see strength.  As far as the economy goes you and your pollyannaish sentiment next to goldylox is palpable.  Cheap oil, a stimulus in and of itself and the opposite of a recession elixir or indicator.
1971 2018-12-25 18:02:54 @atiku the Ndokis in Rivers,Akwa-Ibom & Abia state are major contributors in the oil & gas sector yet no Govt. Presence, if elected what can you do 4 Ndoki people?
1972 2018-12-25 18:02:50 I knew a friend who had a Toyota Corolla and never did an oil change in the entire time he was in college. The car made all sorts of weird noises but it still ran. It still ran... 
1973 2018-12-25 18:02:36 When did this start? Used to have the same, but me it was in my whole house, and I prayed and found out what it was. I took olive oil, prayed over it and anointed my whole house (windows, doors), 3 months in and I have the most peaceful sleeps now.
1974 2018-12-25 18:02:23 The best time to change the oil in your car is to use the guideline recommended by the manufacturer of the vehicle. The engineers who designed it know what is best for optimal engine performance.
1975 2018-12-25 18:01:58 Betting that science is wrong & oil companies are right is the non-linearities, such as Siberian permafrost melting or ocean currents changing, that are most difficult to predict.
1976 2018-12-25 18:01:35 Wishful thinking! West Texas Oil price is already below $45/STB and will dip lower in summer 2019 when 3000+ wells already drilled from Texas & New Mexico will start flowing once pipelines are finished
1977 2018-12-25 18:01:33 Remember the SNP green agenda? We were going to be able to be entirely powered by renewables by some vague future date, and they're still wanting to rely on oil? Maybe they meant the Greens agenda?
1978 2018-12-25 18:01:22 $43 for 1 barrel of oil! Very good news today! I want $5 for 1 barrel! Only in this case our Government will start a reforms in our economy, and we will not be dependable on oil price and we keep our natural resources for future generations! Hooray!!!
1979 2018-12-25 18:01:11 The Davis-Oliver bill will enhance cooperation with state, yet don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
1980 2018-12-25 18:01:08 PMJT has more work experience than Scheer, Kenney, & Harper together!
Kenney was Jesuit College dropout.
Scheer was Insurance Salesman for 6 months + part time Waiter.
Harper was Oil Company Mailroom Clerk, job his dad got 4 him bc they didn't want him home when he drop out Uni
1981 2018-12-25 18:00:56 Debunked my ass. Beto may have not taken lobbyist money but he took it directly from the CEOs in the fossil fuel industry. Because of that slight difference dupes like you now believe Beto isn't influenced by Big Oil.
1982 2018-12-25 18:00:55 You can make a fairly good wood stove out of an oil drum.  Make the door opening below the top a few inches for less smoke.  Vent up and then out the wall through a piece of tin and up some more.  Tin on floor.  Clearance from flammables.
1983 2018-12-25 18:00:50 I have gone the whole day without having a stomach ache and as far as I'm concerned that's my Christmas miracle all praise peppermint oil and kefir amen
1984 2018-12-25 18:00:49 True in theory but in practice oil has been financialised Enron-style since 2004. Mid 2007 to mid 2009 oil price went $80>$140>$35>$80 as supply moved <3%. Marginal cost never really came into it: financial demand & capacity to pay were the determinants

Coal gave way to oil.
Oil is giving way to gas.
All three are giving way to cheaper renewables.

1999 2018-12-25 17:59:55 You are a trader. You are mostly secular. That’s fine with me. My hackles get raised when I encounter Tesla death cult. They are no traders.

2011 2018-12-25 17:57:15 Tell me buddy, where exactly do you think this oil should come from. You use oil and gas by products or you wouldn’t be on a cell phone
2012 2018-12-25 17:56:37 If Trump is Putin's puppet, he's the worst puppet ever:
- sold missiles to Poland
- sold weapons to Ukraine
- expanded oil exploration
- made deal with Germany for LN2 shipments
- lit up ISIS in Syria over Russian objection

How stupid are you?

2030 2018-12-25 17:54:06 Nice argument.  The truth,  however,  is that no road should be like this in the 21st century. Not in Abia that is an oil producing state. Beyond the health hazards, these are also a business prevention strategy. We must reject incompetence and corruption.

2036 2018-12-25 17:52:00 Wrong. You should read the history of the USSR between 1918 and 1960. 

What has allowed humanity to rise so fast and so high since the industrial revolution is the extraction and burning of fossil fuel. You should also read Oil Power and War from Matthieu Auzanneau (@OIL_MEN)

2073 2018-12-25 17:47:35 The only significant ally that the US has in Syria are the Kurds. Before the conflict, the Syrian government had granted them considerable autonomy. The Kurds proceeded to use the chaos created by the jihadis insurgents to illegally seize control of Syria’s best oil wells 
2074 2018-12-25 17:47:34 They can claim to be for these things, I guess, if they feel they have to to try to get my vote, but if they are taking money from oil companies and pharmaceutical companies and defense contractors, etc. I will not believe them. Also, many of these folks do have voting records.

2078 2018-12-25 17:46:27 Likewise, "criminal" is defined by the exiling jurisdiction.  Jurisdictions in undesirable locations, say the Alaska north slope oil fields, will tend to be more "inclusive" because of the need for labor.  Think prison colonies like Australia, in the age of exploration.

2105 2018-12-25 17:42:29 Have you read the Lisbon Treaty - In 2022 we’d become an EU state, & have to give up our currency, sovereignty, nationality. No more Queen or King. Also our fishing rights become owned by EU, and all gas, oil, minerals, all EU property. Financial centres all moved to Strasbourg.

2114 2018-12-25 17:41:17 Salad for me is dressed with oil and vinegar. Seriously, it’s all I have been able to tolerate.
2115 2018-12-25 17:41:12 45$? Hmm ok. How many mls/oz? 
I use 3 of those oils plus lavender and rosemary in my hair in my own lil mix so im willing to try. (Though im not fond of carrot oil) Is it like a nauseating kind of sweet?

2117 2018-12-25 17:40:29 True. But one can only make projection based on reality on ground. Of cause a war or natural disaster can change things.. but you don't plan on hope. One thing is sure though. The days of oil prices north of $90 are well and truly behind us. San a major war in the middle east
2118 2018-12-25 17:40:25 @MoHFW_INDIA Please help me to know about leaftover or waste Used Cooking Oil (UCO). What exactly to do with it as a common person or local vendor? Is it ok to throw it in drains?
2119 2018-12-25 17:40:16 On economy, the govt inherited a broke nation, reserve at $29b, ECA wiped out, oil price at $35 from the $110 under Jonathan and PDP. 27 states were owing salaries. The govt has reflated the economy, FX is available and rate stable, inflation has come down from 28 to 12 pct.

2126 2018-12-25 17:39:28 There are two things that took me aback:
- Why The Hague accepted Chev's claims since it invoked a treaty that not even existed by the time of oil Chev's presence in Ecuador?

- Why The Hague obliges Ecuador to pay anything if the law suit is between 2 entities of private law?
2127 2018-12-25 17:39:16 Just like they do for oil pipelines.
2128 2018-12-25 17:39:10 Start snorting the olbas oil
2129 2018-12-25 17:38:54 saudi they say ties cause its to get oil they make up history to sell vacuums
2130 2018-12-25 17:38:50 Much better actually! Wife hates store bought mayo, but when we make it at home with good mustard and good oil, she likes it.
2131 2018-12-25 17:38:15 I roasted my potatoes in olive oil, always do!
2132 2018-12-25 17:38:13 President @realDonaldTrump, the consumate #snake_oil, #pigs_in_a_poke and #pie_in_the_sky #salesman, has duped many people into believing the wall is necessary. The wall is just a place for President @realDonaldTrump to place his name in large gold letters.

2135 2018-12-25 17:37:46 Thank you! None of us loves paying taxes. Some of us resent paying proportionally more than the 1% or Big Oil & Big Pharma–but we know the benefits our taxes provide to us, the nation, and others. Our tax dodger POTUS is un-American.
2136 2018-12-25 17:37:34 Majorly!  On the stove in a heavy pot, popped in virgin coconut oil,  and freshly ground sea salt over the top while hot! The flavor of corn and coconut is just incredible!
2137 2018-12-25 17:37:16 Red chili oil for me.
2138 2018-12-25 17:37:13 Yeah ive never actually tried one of these either. Im thinking with the oil on it its gonna be a few session joint. I could finish it but it would kind of be a waste. I could definitely get high off that 3 or 4 times lol.

2140 2018-12-25 17:37:01 I use my air fryer all the time, even for stuff that I normally wouldn’t fry. I love it. No oil necessary! Someone should have invented it 40 years ago!!
2141 2018-12-25 17:36:46 Fry the turkey in peanut oil men.... problems solved!  Tastes way better than anything just described.

2146 2018-12-25 17:36:16 You forgot all the MAGA Morons who buy @MyPillowUSA from its holy rolling snake oil salesman.
2147 2018-12-25 17:36:05 I also use African Shea butter and handmade African soap with palm oil
2148 2018-12-25 17:36:03 It was still irresponsible to use loads of oil and burn a ton of shit whilst polluting the land with rubbish and the ocean with plastic in doing so. You may see that the younger generation aren't designers and engineers yet, so we can't do a thing ourselves yet.
2149 2018-12-25 17:35:53 Well why do you think I work in oil and gas now?

- I double cleanse with the Face Shop rice water cleansing oil & foam
2152 2018-12-25 17:35:20 I've never tried a joint with the oil and kief rolled onto it but I heard it's killer!!

2156 2018-12-25 17:34:25 Less.  Way less.  In fact, big oil pays billions in taxes.  I saw a solar field 30 miles north of London.  How idiotic is that?   How many jobs did that cost the U.K.  No way that field generates profits, just one big boondoggle.

The chairman of @ForteOil Plc, Femi Otedola, has announced the sale of his 75% direct and indirect shareholdings in the oil company.
2166 2018-12-25 17:33:18 Oil industry is starting to go by the wayside... they really have no clue what they’re talking about, as global demand for oil continually increases. Lol!
2167 2018-12-25 17:33:10 Just oil could be free by friday.
2168 2018-12-25 17:33:04 And Stocks in Russian oil companies Gazprom, LukOil & God knows what else.  Our Sec of Defense shouldn’t have investments in foreign adversaries.  THIS administration is corrupt & needs to go. Vote every Republican out before they destroy America.

Merry Christmas 
2172 2018-12-25 17:32:25 Not in so many other countries around the world. We can use way less oil and use renewable energy for the rest but we are dinosaurs here in Canada and can't handle renewable energy for some reason.

One problem with both parties is there are certain  policies both are going to pursue if they are in charge, such as regime change in countries that don't kowtow to our banks, oil companies, sweatshop & plantation owners 1/2

2189 2018-12-25 17:29:49 @StocksResearch Beyond certain price downward movement signals a recession which will be bad for India also. Global recession is worse than an oil price which hovers around 75-80$. Stocks will crash so will the growth & GDP

2205 2018-12-25 17:26:42 Yep! Pierce and toss ‘em in. You can lightly oil and salt the skins if you want to. The foil makes them steam a little bit and the consistency is less crisp.

2210 2018-12-25 17:25:46 Merry Christmas to all of you. Many thanks for doing palm oil right
2211 2018-12-25 17:25:28 @HumanistReport Jordan Peterson is a Pseudo Intellectual and Alex Jones is a snake oil salesmen  and these are Right wing saviors and highly respected,Jesus fucking Christ the world we live in is batshit crazy!
2212 2018-12-25 17:25:14 Nothing like getting two gift certificates for an oil change for Christmas because ya girl needs one
2213 2018-12-25 17:25:05 Ooooooooo okay there's a CBD shop chain here I'll check it out. Thank you I felt the same like the gummies are cool but like I felt the oil would be more potent and economical.
2214 2018-12-25 17:25:03 Don't forget to moisturize your scalp with oil this season, you need it more now to mitigate an itchy scalp.

Selah!
2215 2018-12-25 17:25:01 MERRY CHRISTMAS stop using coconut oil on your face and hair it’s not good for either and will clog it all up and ruin you despite what beauty bloggers promote AND A HAPPY NEW YEAR :)
2216 2018-12-25 17:24:27 For the start price of oil is well down which it won't help at all people taxes are well up prices, inflation, are well up so is unemployment the cost of living is outstripping the wages Rouhani needs to focus on these issues and deal with it.

2224 2018-12-25 17:23:22 This is about oil. This is about boosting the price of oil that the Russians sell. Trump’s Americans are blind to the reality of this administration. Why do you think the price has dropped in the U. S.? This deal has been coming through back channels and the murder of Kashoggi?
2225 2018-12-25 17:23:15 Is it really 20 years ago it was less than $2 nation wide, as a GA resident it’s 1.99 here and 3.50 in CA . Also 20 years ago the United States went into “oil glut” .

2229 2018-12-25 17:22:54 Thank you for standing up for what's right. I agree 100%. Lobbying has no business in politics, as it's legalized bribery by the oil, pharma, biotech, gun, and banking industries to benefit them, and not us. It's become a govt of, by, and for the corporations, and not the people.

2241 2018-12-25 17:20:51 You are struggling to sell crude oil in Saudi Arabia. It's a wasted effort. They have it in abundance. Billy Gates did not become the President of America before he started affecting lives positively across the world.

2279 2018-12-25 17:15:19 Actualy, the version I did was contemporary. What should we do whilst we are waiting for the next batch of oil in 2 million years after this stuff runs out?
2280 2018-12-25 17:15:01 I guess they thought I was going to pitch them snake oil or something.

2281 2018-12-25 17:14:53 Merry Christmas to all those who come from the great tradition of American whaling. May your lamps be filled with whale oil and your hearts be filled with joy. 
2282 2018-12-25 17:14:41 I love oil and gas and the benefits it brings to AB. I dont like racists and anti immigrant douchebags who have been opened with welcome arms to your movement. Shame! Shame!
2283 2018-12-25 17:14:34 US will always be net importer of crude oil. Other imports & exports are accounting issues. 

Crude export is bulimia after over-producing light oil we can’t use. Like exporting trash to China.
2284 2018-12-25 17:14:20 Probably too young to remember all this, you may have to do some intellectual work to read up, but the US froze Iranian bank accounts plus all payments going from US companies to Iran in 1979.  US bought a lot of oil from them.  The money has been gathering interest since.
2285 2018-12-25 17:13:58 Vishvesh sir I have feeling it should open some where near 10575 but should hold strong support of 10500 till expiry. Moreover Crude Oil has a steep fall on Monday which would be beneficial for Rupee. What’s your view sir?

IF weed, CBD oil etc works - great it should be an option.
2306 2018-12-25 17:11:12 Its not about Bread. It’s about Oil. Americans and Europeans behind this. They killed Our Africana President Gaddafi just to steal Libya oil.

2313 2018-12-25 17:09:48 The servile attitude of @Lenin toward the States and its corporations has encouraged Chevron to renege on the warrants of those 4 courts labelling them as biased. The Hague accepted Chev's appeal and ruled against Ecuador who would have to pay a compensation to the oil company.
2314 2018-12-25 17:09:32 This wasn't a failed example. This was sabotage due to the U.S. greed for oil. And corrupt Venezuelan presidents. And an unhealthy reliance on oil in a country who thought that it could keep them afloat.

2317 2018-12-25 17:09:10 I'd argue progress is a matter of what one wants to progress towards. The issue with politics (my pov) is that words aren't used by definition when people just describe themselves. What's liberal about controlling guns? Conserving wildlife is different from conservative oil laws.
2318 2018-12-25 17:08:30 I love how the oil prices suddenly took a dive to try to shut the west up about the murder...amazing coincidence isn't it???
2319 2018-12-25 17:08:22 No obama and clintons were trying to put a pipeline direct to Europe. Syria was the only non ally nation the line would have to go through. So they tried to topple Assad. Russia's economy is 100% dependent on oil. The pipeline would crash their economy so they backed Assad.

I just bought these little frog gummies but they’re only 25 each so just not a lot of bang for your buck on those because they were out of 100s & 300s where I go. So I just got a new brand of oil and I might try balm
2342 2018-12-25 17:05:11 This is completely garbled. Vast majority of his donations were small donor. I think you’re being duped by the spirits tslkung point that counted anyone who contributed from oil industry, including workers, as somehow coming from “oil industry.”

2357 2018-12-25 17:03:06 This is part of what US invasion of Iraq done. They were locked inside their country, and that man has put the right control on them. It’s a result of so many factors, and part of it is “Westerns Greed” for oil and redevelopment construction projects and weapons trading.
2358 2018-12-25 17:02:58 @jiffylube And I had my oil changed this month at Jiffylube quick and amazing service!!!.

2361 2018-12-25 17:02:26 The bath recipe: Boil chopped ginger, orange peels, and fresh sage leaves. Run water in tub over sea salt and a few drops of eucalyptus oil. Pour pot contents and get your divine self in there. You can always swap out your oil for lavender for bedtime baths or whatever you prefer
2362 2018-12-25 17:01:56 Cremo oil & the Shea moisture conditioning oil was the last two I used 
2363 2018-12-25 17:01:30 very daring, very nice.
@BJP4India is GANDU party. all 2G free, all bofors-free, all hawala-free. bastards.
2364 2018-12-25 17:01:30 Let’s see oil is down, companies are buying back stocks & they received tax breaks from @realDonaldTrump he just announced we are pulling out of   and Syria! 17 years in  and the market doesn’t like it?? The 1% & the WAR MACHINE don’t like it! #NoMoreWar #WakeUpAmerica
2365 2018-12-25 17:01:24 Carciofi: shaved baby artichoke heart, parmesan over arugula, lemon and olive oil
2366 2018-12-25 17:01:23 Yeah, counter accusation without actually answering the original issue. So is the McCrone report fact, was it suppressed by countless Westminster governments and , considering today’s current oil reserves, not as relevant today as it was 40 odd years ago?
2367 2018-12-25 17:01:02 I see the oil price has come down these past few weeks - when are the pump prices coming down??? The price of diesel is getting ridiculous!! No wonder your profits are at an all time high. Sheer greed!!!

2381 2018-12-25 16:59:32 Are you saying oil should be drilled for in the pristine waters of the Hebrides? Is this part of the SNP Green future? Talk about shooting yourselves in both feet.

2391 2018-12-25 16:58:34 I HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT CBD OIL IS MOST LIKELY PRETTY SAFE FOR US TO USE
2392 2018-12-25 16:58:27 my grandpa got me cbd oil
2393 2018-12-25 16:58:27 Love getting new beard oil
2394 2018-12-25 16:58:24 HAVE BEEN DOING RESEARCH ON CBD OIL WHICH I FEEL WILL HAVE GREAT INFLUENCE ON HEALTH& CLEARED UP SOME THINGS FOR MYSELF& U
2395 2018-12-25 16:58:23 My guess it was one of what we called a “gas station painting,” one of those dreadful oil paintings of mountain scenery or a cabin in the snow that in those days seemed to be sold by people who somehow set up their wares at gas stations.
2396 2018-12-25 16:58:11 Hahhahha, let him come and do thread.
2397 2018-12-25 16:58:09 My mom really wasn’t lying when she said she was gonna take good care of me now that I’m home, she been giving me my iron pills, my birth control pills, and she been rubbing coconut and castor oil in my hair, honestly don’t know what I’d do without her alhamdullilah

2400 2018-12-25 16:57:46 So my eucalyptus essential oil leaked and it soaked by two blunts ... I read up on it and heard a lot people do that but I’m still scared lol
2401 2018-12-25 16:57:43 Trump is giving Russia the middle east and removing sanctions as he promised them for their help winning the election.  Republicans have no honor and are sold out to the military industry complex and the oil industry.  Time to drain the swamp again.

2404 2018-12-25 16:57:07 Well, @incrediblebaker garlic and rosemary sharing wreath was fab with our spicy carrot and lentil soup. Added joy was a za’atar infused oil dip.
2405 2018-12-25 16:57:02 Remember conservatives advocating driving w/deflated tires when Obama reco’d proper pressure to save oil?
2406 2018-12-25 16:56:45 Christmas wuff is baring a nice holiday underwear set. Dat body and abs soaked in gingerbread scented oil. You know what he's gonna do. Surprise some lass's with Christmas cheer!

2410 2018-12-25 16:56:26 You can mix beard oil in their cream 
2411 2018-12-25 16:56:25 We need radical change, which Obama didn't provide. We need a candidate who will speak to peoples material needs directly. No more healthcare bills written by insurance lobbyists, no more deportations, no more drilling for oil. The stakes are life and death.
2412 2018-12-25 16:56:15 Castor oil really did wonders for my eyelashes
2413 2018-12-25 16:56:09 hahaha, are you saying the culprits will go to jail???

i think they will all go home like in 2G and other incidents....

@BJP4India has NO SPINE.
2414 2018-12-25 16:55:59 hmmm turns out this bottle of mineral oil wasn't closed all the way and has been on its side leaking in this drawer......................
2415 2018-12-25 16:55:35 Hey, it's a free heavily oil stained cotton glove! What's not to love about this?!
2416 2018-12-25 16:55:17 really screwed myself by not getting any pot or oil yesterday 
2417 2018-12-25 16:55:08 I’m pissed the only thing I asked my momma for was new tires and an oil change because I just knew we was gone have snow!!!! We don’t even have a piece of the shit
2418 2018-12-25 16:55:04 3. He’s also consistent about support for the oil and gas industry. So you can frame it however you want. Don’t kill the messenger.
2419 2018-12-25 16:54:55 Taam
2420 2018-12-25 16:54:49 THC is the active ingredient in marijuana that's "illegal."
THC can be detected in the body for 2 weeks after use.
THC effect on human lasts for only about 4 hours.
THC is often detected in CBD oil (although at low levels).

Testing positive for THC literally means nothing.

2424 2018-12-25 16:54:31 Then do that. What ever floats your boat. Going to be hard to drive when you have no gas or oil you fool!
2425 2018-12-25 16:54:30 Infrared saunas +Epsom salt baths work too. Coconut oil when starting to get a flare on the area along with anti inflammatory foods and lifestyle works wonders. I've avoided a flare up for 11 years now. Prior to that I always had it on and off my whole prior life.

2428 2018-12-25 16:53:52 Yes it’s is, if anything it should confirm to you guys that Westminster will lie to protect their own interests. Ffs, look back at 2014, oil was fucked apparently, we knew it wasn’t and now we have at least 60 years of it BEFORE we even explore down the Hebrides.
2429 2018-12-25 16:53:44 Holy cow. Get some lavender oil on it. Reduces the sting and helps scarring.
Brave attempt though.
Merry Christmas 
2430 2018-12-25 16:53:40 A mind getting a book oan crude oil 1 year 
2431 2018-12-25 16:53:38 My wife wanted a blender for Christmas, but to sweeten the deal I also added some chocolate, massage oil, body butter, facemasks and a nice fragrance diffuser. 

She really loved it, but this is a weird fucking smoothie.

2436 2018-12-25 16:53:05 Re coconut oil- internal is great overall but actually putting it on the area will calm it down. Also, consuming apple cider vinegar with water will alkanize your body.
2437 2018-12-25 16:52:58 Guess who managed to ALMOST finish up an entire 1.5 hrs of frying latkes without accidentally singeing a finger? I’m not saying it’s the guy who decided to pair a glass of wine and dancing to Dar Williams while cooking with boiling oil, but I AM wearing his underwear.

2443 2018-12-25 16:52:40 lol well my mom always just made them with olive oil and seasonings so that’s how i’ve always had them and they taste just fine like that! non-vegans always add unnecessary shit to their food for no reason
2444 2018-12-25 16:52:39 I am here wondring why I have never been able to know what brand of oil that these porn stars be using.... they always showing the back of the bottle...
2445 2018-12-25 16:52:35 Full of  Xmas cheer... Had a silly thought. If you have to peg the dollar to something that comes out of the ground, peg it to a barrel of oil, or equivalent joules... Invert the ratio.
Might do more for the Great Transition than anything else.

I should stop munching on chocolates and im running out of tea tree oil alrd now. Prolly start drinking green tea every night back hais sigh stress!
2451 2018-12-25 16:51:11 It’s still relevant today, still being told the oils running out, still being told not to make a big deal of it because it will ‘encourage’ those who believe we are better at running our own country than Mundell, Johnson, Gove etc.   Last time round we had 20 years oil left.
2452 2018-12-25 16:50:55 Let's wait and see  optimism first
2453 2018-12-25 16:50:53 It’s honestly the best olive oil out there
2454 2018-12-25 16:50:39 Even simple fucking choices when eating a holiday meal- laying off the potatoes and white bread which are loaded with sugar, substituting olive oil and garlic for butter, and

2460 2018-12-25 16:49:58 Why are there troopers all over I-20. Where the hell are y’all during all the oil field traffic.
2461 2018-12-25 16:49:40 But we are in dire straits on many fronts so tall and lanky doesn’t cut it. POLICIES matter. We need to stop oil drilling, spend less on the MIC, reform the health care and justice systems. So looking at the candidates’ voting records closely is crucial.

2490 2018-12-25 16:43:57 Thank you to all those who produce Oil & Gas and make our way of life possible.
2491 2018-12-25 16:43:48 Just ate mie sedap rasa soto with lots of fish balls and miyeok (it's korean wakame, I think) and drizzle of sesame oil it's so fuckin good.
2492 2018-12-25 16:43:44 I don’t watch the news, but I am TWTR so there is truth to that. But I’m am civil engineer in development, typically tip of the spear. Things have slowed some but nothing like 2008. Oil has collapsed but is just back to 2016 level, the stock market didn’t care than. Oil dying com
2493 2018-12-25 16:43:19 The price of oil right now is under $43/barrel, I suppose that's Trudeau's fault too? No pipeline in the world is going to raise that!
2494 2018-12-25 16:43:16 I like the commercials where they clean oil spills off animals
2495 2018-12-25 16:43:14 ExxonMobil was named 2018 Large Cap Company of the Year and Explorer of the Year by the World Oil and Gas Council in recognition of excellence and innovation in the global energy industry. #guyana #brazil
2496 2018-12-25 16:42:33 I will surely put some cooking oil in his hair oil product.
2497 2018-12-25 16:42:25 Thank you! Will try that IA  I just bought a teeny tiny taklon brush but I thought of dedicating that for oil paint. Baru nak start experiment. I usually buy my art supplies from Art Friend. Mind sharing where you got yours?  hee sorry byk tanya
2498 2018-12-25 16:42:12 But our submarine is not state of the art. Many interested parties want to keep obsolete parts of it running. Defense of coal or oil subsidies is no better than ignoring carbon removal or space mirrors.
2499 2018-12-25 16:42:09 Managing stress +keeping in line with anti-inflammatory diet +lifestyle. Coconut oil (anti inflammatory) helps.

2500 2018-12-25 16:42:02 Can I oil it up a likkle
2501 2018-12-25 16:41:57 . at least partly absurd, e.g., that the YPG can keep control of the oil fields as a bargaining chip, or that Turkey is going to care about 'global censure'.
2502 2018-12-25 16:41:12 My mother, 79, whose positions on drugs are about as progressive as Jeff Sessions’, has cured her chronic back pain with CBD oil, she just announced.
2503 2018-12-25 16:40:59 So RESPECTED truth that USA controls the whole communications, the oil market, the weapons...fostered egiptian spring and bombed Gheddafi, Hussein, Laden and a looong list of others. 
I like a lot your ignorant hypocrites affirmations...these are good for the average americans!

2511 2018-12-25 16:39:55 It was SO good! From Chrissy Teigan’s Cravings! And it was just Arugula, burrata, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, a medley of tomatoes, and prosciutto crisps!!!
2512 2018-12-25 16:39:48 Do you want to know why the stock market crashed? It’s because of how low the oil barrels prices have become!
2513 2018-12-25 16:39:24 You know what should be upsetting people more than the pipelines?

That they are still exploring for new oil sources.
2514 2018-12-25 16:39:21 Well to be honest US started the problems starting in Iraq. Stay out of other county's business then, your leaving your allies to clean up the mess you started. There could be a blood bath if the Turks now go after the Kurds who you we backing. Is oil worth all this.
2515 2018-12-25 16:39:11 between this + traversing the desert on camels + oil lamps being another gift + gold being another gift + the idea that we’re really looking at three zoroastrian astrologer kings = pretty convinced King Paimon and co. visited bb christ

2526 2018-12-25 16:37:56 As for marijuana, there are no benefits to it either, just like with tobacco.

Still, just legalise everything, reap the taxes (shut down the black market) and educate people so that they cannot complain later that they 'did not know'.

2529 2018-12-25 16:37:40 U.S occupies Syria's oil fields. Rogin here thinks that oil will go to Iran as soon as the US troops leave. Iran & Russia were officially invited by the Syrian gov. to fight other US assets such as AQ , Al-Nusra and ISIS. With the U.S gone Syria can use the oil to rebuild.

2533 2018-12-25 16:37:03 He raised taxes, he canceled pipelines, changed legislation to make pipelines harder to build. He failed to appeal a preposterous court ruling. In all while world oil prices have risen he’s materially contributed to a politically orchestrated recession in Alberta.

2542 2018-12-25 16:35:56 Soon a big drop in the dollar as Russia now sells in yuan. For decades the petrodollar made usa rich, but now more and more are not dealing in dollar, they prefer euro, yuan.

Hello Sir,
Petrol Price was around 90 rupees per ltr, when WTI Crude Oil was around $74-$75/ Barrel.
And Now crude oil is $42-$43. Almost 40 % reduction.
Why is it not reflecting with same percentage?
Please answer this to nation before 2019 election

2587 2018-12-25 16:29:35 Merry Christmas President Trump!
All I want for Christmas from you is the Oil industry to get some love. If you keep oil low, you will not win Texas, Louisiana, or Oklahoma. You are killing good paying jobs for all of us down here that voted you in. $70 per barrel is good for all
2588 2018-12-25 16:29:24 Turkey needs the oil in the north of Syria . And they will kill the Kurds who have been fighting along side with us
2589 2018-12-25 16:29:08 Yo i tried laneige cleansing oil and uh wow i loike em,,, but expensive,,, wut shud i do help

2591 2018-12-25 16:28:47 The sanctions passed overwhelmingly. He criticized Russia strongly, again. The vote didn’t help Russia and his comments didn’t support Russia. Seems like the “excuse” is actually his reason. I’d love to hear Beto’s reason for supporting offshore oil drilling or bank deregulation.
2592 2018-12-25 16:28:46 thanks. I don't think David here does, though, nor the fact that the path to  legislative and executive control by Dems runs around and not through big oil/gas/coal producing states.
2593 2018-12-25 16:28:31 I’m a tool?  You use Twitter lite on a Pixel 2 XL. 
My car was brand new. It was a lemon.
The difference? Tesla will fix your car for free. Honda & all other Automaker dealerships?  They give you the bad news that your oil change was fine but it’ll be $600 to fix a non-problem.
2594 2018-12-25 16:28:28 I was listening to the various news talk shows and they said the tanker concerns were tied to the project. Increasing rail oil shipments and tankers for that was still allowed. So they could be wrong, but if that were the case. Notley wouldn’t buy railcars.
2595 2018-12-25 16:28:19 その心は(大喜利)
2596 2018-12-25 16:28:11 Yes that is right.  And so when central banks around the world take away the free money. That was being used to pump up all asset classes. Including commodities like oil.  It causes the price to drop because investment money dried up
2597 2018-12-25 16:27:53 こないな氏とセットでみてたから勘違いしててもうしわけない、、
2598 2018-12-25 16:27:32 It was under Jonathan we experienced our first official train revival, and he gave life to many rail project including the popular abj Kaduna line. It was Jonathan who signed local content act into law, opening the oil industry to Nigeria companies.
2599 2018-12-25 16:27:30 I'm going to try and send you some videos on how to make oil or edibles.
2600 2018-12-25 16:27:25 A lot of oil money in that shot
2601 2018-12-25 16:27:08 In September when SPX was near all time highs the market had priced in 2.4 fed hikes for 2019.    Its December and the market isn’t pricing in any rate hikes in 19.   The difference is “tariff man” tweet, falling oil, revolving door at WH, tweet attacks against Fomc, and brexit
2602 2018-12-25 16:27:03 '9ja set for electric cars'; yet the oil  & gas sector remains her main source of revenue  We are where we are b/c our leaders are suffering from the "misguided priorities syndrome". Let's learn to crawl first before we think of flying
2603 2018-12-25 16:27:00 Cooking a lot today and I’ve just realized something very important: I’m a whore for some good olive oil and fresh garlic. That is all, carry on. Merry Christmas.
2604 2018-12-25 16:26:57 Crude oil is falling but petrol rates are not reducing.
2605 2018-12-25 16:26:48 That sounds like the biggest piece of junk I've heard if in years. 

The family Rav4 has 41,000 miles just replaced the OEM tires and other than routine oil changes it's required zero replacement parts or maintenance.

2623 2018-12-25 16:24:43 No, because they aren't the ones bottlenecking the transition to clean energy. The energy sector is. This isn't hard. There is no more singularly culpable party than oil/gas firms who verifiably knew about climate change and worked to actively derail both discourse and solutions

2626 2018-12-25 16:24:28 So is everyone with oil or coal shares....
2627 2018-12-25 16:24:23 I love them roasted in OIL, crunchy, little salt.
2628 2018-12-25 16:24:17 For Christmas lunch... seared steaks drissled with both white and black truffle oil and sprinked with white and black truffle salt...

2630 2018-12-25 16:24:06 Hay un país, que sin destrozar sus Parques Nacionales, exporta $5000 MM de algo que no es petróleo ni cobre. Nos lo dice @FridaSiKahlo "Salmoneras baten récord. Exportaciones superan los US$5.000 millones. Se transforma en segundo producto más exportado del país". Bye bye... Oil.

2644 2018-12-25 16:22:00 Thank you for sacrificing our young men and woman to protect our oil. You are a real American hero.
2645 2018-12-25 16:21:58 I feel most countries that have taken Saudi money or have been influenced by Saudi are having rights issues. Pak & Afghanistan are probably the top Saudi aid receivers.

I truly hope one day the world does not need any more oil.
2646 2018-12-25 16:21:52 We live in an oil based economy and consume goods and services derived from oil  and Texas is an oil producing state which Beto represents so maybe you should move on from that issue. . .
2647 2018-12-25 16:21:52 If I went to church I would stand up and say “No Way!” Hip-hop is a mind control technique invented to get people’s hands in the air! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
2648 2018-12-25 16:21:30 Once I try this Jamaican black castor oil relaxer and d thing no pain me at all. That's what I'm using for life I can't stand the pain that comes with mega growth again.
2649 2018-12-25 16:21:23 ほんと好き
2650 2018-12-25 16:21:15 Mate, I always use olive oil for roasties. Part boil the potatoes, pre heat some oil in a roasting tray, tip potatoes on the tray and drizzle with more oil. Cook for an hour. They come out perfect.
2651 2018-12-25 16:21:11 Beto is Obama2.0.  We can't have 8 more years of no green deal, drone bombs/deaths,oil/gas/fracking out of control, banksters, massive 1.5 Trillion in student debt, unaudited obscene military budget, 1000 bases all over the world, seven wars, no medicare for all. He lies.
2652 2018-12-25 16:21:09 Exactly. It was coconut oil. What other oil can one try?
2653 2018-12-25 16:20:38 Sure!. As She silently approve the ongoing GENOCIDE of Hebrew Biafra by British govt and their jihadists to steal oil and gas. Let her speak....TRUTH is SUPREME. LIBERTY  AND FREEDOM.
2654 2018-12-25 16:20:30 I’m still mad her dude really used up all the oil 
2655 2018-12-25 16:20:09 I prefer the adjective “toothless”. OPEC is basically Saudi. OPEC+ is basically Saudi and Russia. US is now net-exporting. Saudi is US’ bitch. US (with Saudi) wants oil price low from Trump’s shallow point of view. You see the problem now? It’s more of geopolitics than anything..
2656 2018-12-25 16:20:03 Really- we built critical infrastructure that didn't work? Doubtful. They'd be able to sue in a US court if someone built a faulty dam. They should stop paying China. There were illegal bribes-faulty dangerous construction. Im against oil- but they can sell oil to someone else.
2657 2018-12-25 16:19:57 my parents got me a kindle and an essential oil diffuser so basically 2019 is gonna be full of me living my best life
2658 2018-12-25 16:19:38 Yes outside so the oil scent of fried chicken doesn’t get inside the house lol

2676 2018-12-25 16:17:48 We had a double dip recession in 2002-2003. Everything other than GDP tells you that.
Closest thing to a recession in 2011: oil prices, ongoing hh deleveraging, housing overhang, fiscal austerity, and tight financial conditions from euro crisis and maybe debt ceiling
2677 2018-12-25 16:17:46 バ愛おしい
2678 2018-12-25 16:17:44 It's blatantly connotated though with your statements. Money in politics, climate disruption and citing links on oil and gas clearly mean your trying to portray Beto as an oil corporation receiver.
2679 2018-12-25 16:17:39 I'm sure the rainbow paint covered with tire marks, oil and wino piss will be something to see. I'm in central AZ and also won't have to use these often.
2680 2018-12-25 16:17:28 Ah thank you! I recently got into some 10mg gummies and the sleep and calm I get from them has been life changing. Now I know all CBD products are not made equal so do you recommend any brands? Also would I be better trying the oil?
2681 2018-12-25 16:17:16 @TheOfficialSBI To #sbi the 5 litre petrol plan you tweeted no petrol bunk of #Indian oil in #Vijayawada how to redeem it they are looking us like fools so how do we use redeem points and get petrol in bunks in #vja better implement in metropolitan cities but not in bckward citys
2682 2018-12-25 16:17:04 As a Chief Bachelor, You will be frying your turkey and the oil will be doing Po Po on your Body This shit can be very annoying 
2683 2018-12-25 16:16:38 Cool.  Untraditional, but I really like it with puff pastry.  I bake the buttery pastry on an olive oil greased sheet, and the crispy olive oil-butter flavor works wonders with the anchovy and sweet onions.
2684 2018-12-25 16:16:34 I don’t even know where to begin

Shawty didn’t oil the turkey, didn’t wash it, didn’t season it.. just grabbed the soap and started put it in the pan....

2686 2018-12-25 16:16:22 Before the conflict erupted, the Syrian government granted the Kurds considerable autonomy. The Kurds proceeded to use the chaos created by the jihadis insurgents to seize control of Syria’s best oil wells. They will not be able to retain control without backing from US forces

2694 2018-12-25 16:14:46 @JustinTrudeau will also be celebrated as a Founding Father of the Republic of Western Canada.

We’re going to erect 2 statues of him beside the gate on our eastern border.

Oil soaked JT with out turned pockets banging on the wall & Hobo-JT facing west begging for change.

2696 2018-12-25 16:14:20 Turns out, putting a big bow on your wife’s car and surprising her with a new air filter/oil change does not have the same effect as buying her a brand new Mercedes.....BUT it is hilarious

2702 2018-12-25 16:13:38 Absolutely! Hopefully they have enough oil reserves to cover the debt.

2705 2018-12-25 16:13:10 To improve memory think also ROSEMARY OIL! Even better to use coconut oil as the carrier oil with rosemary! Teen kiddo uses Rosemary oil for final exams. It works!

"Rosemary for remembrance" was a line from Shakespeare's Hamlet!

2707 2018-12-25 16:12:53 She exhibited at museums occasionally, but mostly they sat in our house. It was magical when she turned the lights on inside them: tiny chandeliers and oil lamps, all glowing from inside tiny rooms with velvety chaise lounges and flocked wallpaper.
2708 2018-12-25 16:12:45 Merry Christmas!!! I threw my back out drizzling white truffle oil on roasted potatoes!!!
2709 2018-12-25 16:12:39 oil supply in the market went down and therefore the price went up. :-)

2710 2018-12-25 16:12:24 Compare Shia countries to Sunni countries. You will bark about the large numbers of oil reserves in the Gulf, but forget that Yemen, a gulf country with more than 40% Shias, is being destroyed by you Rafidhis.

The oil miracle was a bechina of yesh m'yesh - it came from elsewhere in the world (miraclulously), so naturally the total

2717 2018-12-25 16:12:03 Im all about the environment. Going cold turkey on fossil fuels is BS and unrealistic and everyone knows it. It has to be phased out. $ from oil will help achieve the cost of going greener.
2718 2018-12-25 16:12:03 For the shrimp I sauté minced garlic, fresh basil, and tomatoes in a pan with butter and olive oil. Season with salt, pepper, Italian seasoning and a lil old bay.

2728 2018-12-25 16:10:08 Not good. Turkey's reportedly been supporting IS, there's been reports of Turkey buying oil from it. And Turkey's only objective is obliterating the Kurds. It's the last party that should be trusted with fighting IS.
2729 2018-12-25 16:10:03 I’ve been smoking weed for over 15 years. In Switzerland I tried CBD oil for the first time. I know THC and CBD are different things that make you feel differently. I drank the whole bottle of oil in one sitting and felt scammed. CBD is a waste of time.

2746 2018-12-25 16:06:54 @narendramodi @PMOIndia @FinMinIndia BEST time to buy a lot of oil from all countries so that high prices should not impact country in next two years? Please get some insulation from high price. Its best chance for you and BJP that god has given. Please make sure you utilize it.

2748 2018-12-25 16:06:45 U.S governments DDD list:
1. Destruction ( destroying oil rich nations & occupying their Oil fields)
2. Defense (satisfying the weapons manufacturers by toppling regimes & wep. sales to oppressive regimes)
3. Drugs (satisfying big pharma by occupying opioid fields in Afghanistan)
2749 2018-12-25 16:06:43 That's incorrect. 

They lost funding when Russia started to bomb all the ISIS oil smuggling into Turkey, successfully blocking their financial means. That had nothing to do with Trump, who actually protected those terrorists from Russian, Syrian and Hezbollah fire. Get it right
2750 2018-12-25 16:06:35 Don't leave oil stains on your CD and consoles please
2751 2018-12-25 16:06:06 I have solution. Invite Mexico into the Union. Our flag would have 83 stars instead of just 50. We wouldn't have the problem pumping oil from Mexico like we do in the Arctic. And we certainly wouldn't need massive security on the border.

2757 2018-12-25 16:05:30 You know you’ve hit adulthood when you get motor oil and body wash for Christmas and you’re legitimately happy about it.
2758 2018-12-25 16:05:28 Your Ladies size chart for NFL Pro Line is off by at least 2 full sizes. Ordered what I thought was one size too large, but way too small.  Wife had to roll it on like a condom.  Can't return because it is customized. Now I have $50 oil rag for my garage.
2759 2018-12-25 16:05:21 (referring to my hair)

Dad: when's the last time you changed that oil?
Me: 2 days ago
Dad: I can tell, you got your miles worth out of it

2761 2018-12-25 16:04:52 @KimKardashian hi Kim, there is a remedy for  plaque psoriasis, try this, get some apple cider vinegar and put it on the affected area, leave it then after an hour put some tea tree oil on the affected area, see how this works, I have some other useful herbs as well, all the best

2764 2018-12-25 16:04:42 even Iran is only funding 30% of its budget through oil. our parents have failed us.

2765 2018-12-25 16:04:42 I can drink beer now! hurray!but I wont drink it cuz tastes like efficascent oil! 
2766 2018-12-25 16:04:40 Personally I love them with butter/oil, salt, and pepper.

But I’ve loved them since I was a kid, so possibly your gateway grits need to be fancier.
2767 2018-12-25 16:04:22 Got a mini oil diffuser but which essential oil will deposit money in my bank account
2768 2018-12-25 16:04:03 Oil prices key now. If goes through the $40 level it will make this sell off look like scrappy do
2769 2018-12-25 16:04:03 Get a 747 off the ground w/o oil then someone might listen.

2774 2018-12-25 16:03:08 Interesting, you are one of the few to note the collapse of the S&P is coinciding with the oil collapse.
2775 2018-12-25 16:03:07 Pat with extra oil
2776 2018-12-25 16:02:57 I live on East Coast by St John NB refinery where Saudi oil comes in. Ocean is fine, clean. Supplier..not so much. Best lobster in the world. Good line though.

2783 2018-12-25 16:02:15 Evangelicals are basically snake oil salesmen. They don’t care who murders who so long as they stay tax exempt. Pathetic. Money Hungry. Cowards. Not unlike much of today’s GOP.
2784 2018-12-25 16:02:01 Thought: Russia and Iran want path to Hezbolla open and gas/oil deal so US pulls troops out of the way (Syria) Turkey will be able to attack Kurds

2785 2018-12-25 16:01:50 my dad trying to describe how Yorkshire puddings are cooked: “they’re sort of baked on top and roasted on the sides. what’s the word for when the oil is on the inside? they’re internally roasted”
2786 2018-12-25 16:01:47 رائعة يعطيكي العافية
2787 2018-12-25 16:01:14 SNAKE OIL.
2788 2018-12-25 16:01:12 What is different is that, Modi is not delaying payments thereby hiding actual costs. Nothing hidden here as @dpradhanbjp clearly issued statement on fuel prices, subsidy and oil bonds. Don’t know what your problem is ultimately, but crude to petrol price can’t be 1-1.
2789 2018-12-25 16:01:09 +
2790 2018-12-25 16:00:57 i would also rec biore cleansing oil, very effective and easy (also cheap!)  no need cotton pads just pump it to your palm and massage gently it will remove ur eye makeup incl waterproof makeup dissolves easily with this one

Once upon a time the paper money in our pockets used to say gold/silver certificate now it says federal reserve note

“Crude oil guna sebagai apa?”
“Cooking oil” 

That’s honestly summarising my whole semester. Sengal 
2798 2018-12-25 15:59:56 All I want for Christmas is to steal this big tub of coconut oil from my parents house tbh 
2799 2018-12-25 15:59:56 石油王さんwwwwww昨日いました！？ww
2800 2018-12-25 15:59:53 We have all the oil we want, we export it now and are about to out produce the Saudis and Russians. No longer can these OPEC nations and Russia ever hold us hostage for oil again. It’s in all the papers.
2801 2018-12-25 15:59:48 City interessado no Quintero yes yes yes may the oil money be good for something
2802 2018-12-25 15:59:45 It probably heats up the oil hella fast but I am sure there is some chemical that makes this a bad idea
2803 2018-12-25 15:59:39 my mom got me a oil diffuser with oils for happiness lmfaoooo she’s so cute
2804 2018-12-25 15:59:38 Did every white person get a pair of AirPods and/or CBD oil this year?
2805 2018-12-25 15:59:14 Here's a suggestion. Take the two oil paintings of yourself that you bought with "charity" money and fasten them to a segment of the wall that is already built. That can be your presidential library. Jerk.

Yes I do have an issue that Saudi or anyone reap the earth of its resources for their own benefits
2809 2018-12-25 15:58:41 Someone stole my package my dad sent me for Christmas. To that person: I hope you enjoy my pajama pants and motor oil. 
2810 2018-12-25 15:58:06 Don’t really wanna be a stoner. I’m cool with getting high after a couple hits and keeping a low overhead idk about ya’ll with your oil rigs and bongs and shit.

2812 2018-12-25 15:57:58 Dude. Everyone knows me so well! I got a sick ass hot sauce set with 8 new sauces. A Yankees jersey. A new hoodie. An essential oil diffuser and some other random shit. The day is barely even started! 
2813 2018-12-25 15:57:46 Thank you. Yep, fibro. SMH. 

I tried CBD oil, but didn’t have much luck. But I got some CBD bath salts and love them. I’m assuming transdermal delivery works better for me than oral.

2816 2018-12-25 15:57:05 All the fed had to do was pause rates and say they were going to be data dependent and take a wait and see approach. Hiking and saying on target for 2 more hikes in 2019 in a down market with housing and oil down was dumb. Fed funds rate at 2.25% was perfect reasonable imo.

2827 2018-12-25 15:55:13 I have a bunch of fresh herbs to throw in there. I'm gonna do the beets balsamic, but the rest of the veg are getting gravy so they're gonna be herbs/salt/pepper/oil. I always do the veg because nobody at these dinners can ever season them right.
2828 2018-12-25 15:55:11 I bet your oil change is passed due
2829 2018-12-25 15:55:10 Don't forget the moats with flaming oil or the alligators. The Berlin wall was built to keep people IN, not keep people out. Nobody was trying to illegally enter East Berlin.

2833 2018-12-25 15:53:57 It's a fiat currency whose value has dropped about 98% since its Inception. The only thing that gives it value is the amount in circulation and the petrodollar of oil sales. And as they print more money for circulation inflation increases and you're buying power decreases

2839 2018-12-25 15:53:11 I use olive oil. Makes it easier to scrape it out of the pan and into the trash.
2840 2018-12-25 15:53:01 Not all.
i.e. #Manbij is lost for now.

I will be glad if #SAA gets ALL main Oil & Gas Fields, FULLY secure #Hasakah & #Qamishli Cities & Al-Bukamal area on Euphrates East Bank.
Raqqa and nearby airbase would be nice & still possible specially if PKK delays enough Turkey.
2841 2018-12-25 15:52:57 I think too much mixture in each and too little oil, they were very stuck to the tin

2857 2018-12-25 15:49:44 Important to highlight the difference between people donating $20 a pop for progressive causes and an oil exec, along with literally all of their peers, dropping as much as they legally can to buy access.

And that’s how a NAY vote on an offshore drilling ban is made.

2887 2018-12-25 15:47:13 Scottish sanity would check the oil price and Scottish debt before a vote. If you didn’t get it at $100 a barrel your not going to get it with all your oil industry on hand outs.

2898 2018-12-25 15:43:37 We did not allow terrorists to go to Syria across our borders and also we did not buy Iraqi oil that Isis stole, Turkey has done all that and more, so it is a terrorist state with Iran and Qatar.

2935 2018-12-25 15:39:34 amazes me that anti pipeline protesters can't see the forest for the trees. we want to sell more oil to china , the country with 15% + global pollution and get them off coal. that will do more for a green economy than stopping  a pipeline. Help us build one

3032 2018-12-25 15:24:36 1. wash your face every morning and night. 
~acne is often caused by bacteria, so washing your face can help remove some of that.

2. tea tree oil.
~tea tree oil is known for fighting acne , you can buy it at almost any pharmacy and just aply a bit to any spots before you sleep.

3051 2018-12-25 15:22:27 Actually most of the subsidies sre depletion tax credits, not subsidies, not unlike mining and other resource extraction indistries.Govt make far more $ back in other forms of taxation from oil so its not a business reliant on subsidies.

3055 2018-12-25 15:21:39 @MarilynDenisCTV Your Christmas Day show is contradictory, talking about safety yet cooking with a hot pot of oil on a stove.  Scott MacGillivray should know better!  #dontdothisathome
3056 2018-12-25 15:21:31 Yes I can attest to this. Also helps with my arthritis in my legs and ankles. I was sceptical until I tried it. Been using the oil for about 2 weeks

3060 2018-12-25 15:21:00 Quizás la caída del Brent (Oil) y la reducción de subsidios (Gas), sean la excusa perfecta para comenzar a debatir hasta dónde mucho de nuestros NC son “Reservas” (profesionalmente hablando)? {es habitual, quizás intencionalmente, asimilar Reservas a Recursos! Inaceptable}

My oven broke half way through cooking dinner

Kept flashing “pre” meaning it’s trying to get to temp but never actually getting to temp

The potatoes were stewing in oil instead of roasting

Bullshited it into life with its rapid heat up mode

3069 2018-12-25 15:19:39 While you do need fat and oil to survive, try spicing your food with other spices to add variety. Ginger, hot sauce, sweet peppers and cinnamon are all zero calorie ways to add flavor to any dish.

The dough is oily and crumbly and super hard to work with, but it bakes exactly like regular shortbread. Slight coconut taste, but you can add icing, or lean into it by adding lime

3201 2018-12-25 15:03:30 What unsupported assertion. I've called Corbyn a snake oil salesman. That's an opinion. The rest of my statements are verifiable (not my job to do that for you).
People voted to leave for many reasons but, ultimately, the result was criminally bought. I'll never respect it.
3202 2018-12-25 15:03:26 I do not endorse this mam, this sounds as simple as asking people not to raise voice for increasing pertrol/diesel price just because we do not know how to extract them from crude oil.

3377 2018-12-25 14:37:31 Zamfara is a sharia town. Their views and ours don't exactly align. They will only acknowledge a Southerner or southern Nigeria because their oil keeps the lights on. 
They ought to do better for themselves.
3378 2018-12-25 14:37:08 Stop misleading your gullible followers. Do you know what quantity of oil that would have been sold to raise $2.1b in 1978 (not 1979)?

For a company that was less than 2 years?

Very funny

The macroeconomic situation and its impact on oil demand continue to put pressure on oil prices. As the closure of the U.S. government intensifies concerns about economic growth, investors rush to hedge assets such as gold 。

3468 2018-12-25 14:24:48 여우...이름...시유도 있어
3469 2018-12-25 14:24:42 Well Trump has actually threatened for low oil prices on Twitter. Having said that, we actually kept the oil from Iran flowing which helps.
3470 2018-12-25 14:24:34 Adam wrote that song. “Come light my menorah. Bring your burning oil to me.”
3471 2018-12-25 14:24:30 You can roast a radish!?! Had NO idea! I’m doing this! Olive oil and salt and pepper?
3472 2018-12-25 14:24:30 I will sometimes use wine or what's known as "dove's blood oil", which you can find in some hoodoo or botanica stores. If you're of a PGM bent, you could do the "you are wine, you are not wine but the blood of Athena" verbal "baptism" trick.
3473 2018-12-25 14:24:27 Naphtalan oil. Try it. Two places in the world have it.
3474 2018-12-25 14:24:19 first time I made chicken with 40 cloves (in college) I forgot that broth and wine existed and instead kept adding more and more oil.
3475 2018-12-25 14:24:14 Action speaks louder than words. So end ALL the support for all those that are still fighting. The hired and trained mercenaries. No more blood for oil and money. It's sick, ridiculous and incredibly evil.

3479 2018-12-25 14:23:45 haha typical Canadian. Crossed the line? I didn't do anything but ask a simple question. You have oil? We will take it.
3480 2018-12-25 14:23:37 that isnt us depending on palm oil, that is the corporations depending on palm oil.
3481 2018-12-25 14:23:08 I know red palm oil is a sorta-blood substitute in some ATRs, but we also don't really need blood substitutes per se for the obvious reason. Dunno if it's also a Tibetan one, given the change in climate between there and what's needed for palm trees…

3484 2018-12-25 14:22:49 Even Jill Stein. She has a lot of stock. Oil companies, tobacco companies. If Burnie were to release his taxes you'll see he owns a lot of stock also.

3505 2018-12-25 14:19:58 The rich can afford to survive it. We are the ones that get screwed. They’ll see when hyperinflation kicks in and the dollar is only worth fifty cents. Oil prices will be great sure but buying bread and milk will be the problem.

please stop asking if I do.

3516 2018-12-25 14:18:54 We aren't addicted to #oil, but our #cars are. - James Woolsey
3517 2018-12-25 14:18:39 1, Canada has enough oil to sustain itself just fine.
2. Everything you listed as the reasons for Beto being a threat, I would agree with.
There's nothing wrong with having pride in where you live, and I appreciate your opinion, but we really have nothing to talk about. Be well.
3518 2018-12-25 14:18:35 I forgot that a struggle of living up north is dealing with furnaces. Merry Christmas, we’re out of heating oil on the coldest day of the season so far 
3519 2018-12-25 14:18:28 The Chinese restaurant around the corner from me makes the most delicious egg drop soup. I stir in some soy sauce and chili oil and dump in the fried wonton strips and go to town. It’s all I crave when I’m sick.
3520 2018-12-25 14:18:06 You chose wage growth over job growth or unemployment. That’s an editorial choice much like the ones the snake oil salesmen at Fox News make. There’s plenty on which you can slam Trump, but I don’t think the economy is one of them.

3527 2018-12-25 14:16:48 Algo traders do an excellent job promoting the idea that only rubbish traders blame them for dangerous market instability but who else blasts 500 points off the Dow and crushes oil $4 on Xmas Eve in cemented lockstep after a few moronic but neutral Trump tweets #OOTT

3531 2018-12-25 14:16:26 If it’s surfaced, the hydrocolloid patches are great. If it’s still ‘underground’, try hot compresses and tea tree oil until it shows itself.

3533 2018-12-25 14:16:10 He took all that oil and gas money in his campaign and it compromised himself in the eyes of his base. he is a leader on the immigration issue and doing good work there. Centrists are neoliberals that choose corporations over People. Good on immigration, bad on environment
3534 2018-12-25 14:16:07 Funny thing is it did not move much on Xmas even when oil plunged. Now it moves so much

3616 2018-12-25 14:06:33 @Pontifex please be more specific. Condemn Coal and Oil and Gas that are the source of wars, global warming, and disease and have corrupted all industrialized nations especially undeveloped nations who have coal and oil resources. Be specific. Generalities are useless.
3617 2018-12-25 14:06:29 Did you read his analogy of the typical Hausa man that leaves home to work down south and only returns with his poly bag? We are creative but lack funds but some people still want to be spoon fed because we have oil!!!!
3618 2018-12-25 14:06:18 쓰알이 아직도 없어요~~~?~~?~?~?~?~???? 나는 일.한 합쳐서 9갠데~~~~~~~~~~
3619 2018-12-25 14:06:03 AND we are not talking, ever, of living w/out oil. Just of using what is left in a much wiser, more careful, long-term way. We CAN (must) rethink our transport, urban design, agriculture & manufacture and transition to a low carbon economy. The Science of Climate Change is CLEAR.
3620 2018-12-25 14:06:03 we put out more oil, we put out more wind energy than any other state. More than the top 12 COUNTRIES.

3626 2018-12-25 14:05:01 Looks yummy! I usually add some chimichurri on my steaks, made using extra virgin olive oil of course 
3627 2018-12-25 14:04:46 Paint this Osmo PolyX Oil on my new wooden surface used to cover the top of an old table on the balcony. Fantastic result.
3628 2018-12-25 14:04:43 @cspanwj Cold water brought to boil turned off and left on burner. Right? Damn, forget the olive oil.
3629 2018-12-25 14:04:23 If it’s not about substantive issues then why does Beto not share half of Bernie’s policies? Beto supports Israel, he doesn’t support Medicare for all, he’s in the pocket of big oil and Wall Street while Bernie isn’t. There are actually real differences between them

3648 2018-12-25 14:02:28 Also to let you know CBD oil is approved by the FDA unlike Osterine which is a completely banned substance. It is not for human consumption, you’re such an idiot. It doesn’t take long to find information but you may not be able to spell Osterine. It wouldn’t surprise me.
3649 2018-12-25 14:02:26 Guess what? I TOTALLY agree with you. Just like plastics, coal and oil HAVE served us,well and for that we ARE grateful. But knowing what we now know, with perfectly feasible alternative, it woyld be sheer madness, incredibly shortsighted to continue investing in Fossil Fuels.

3701 2018-12-25 13:54:17 ...... and he renegotiated NAFTA, oversaw income tax reform, gave us oil policies that gave us a surplus in oil to sell to the world and lower gasoline prices. Never any mention of positive things are we the last 2 years in the network media or Power hungry democrats.

3761 2018-12-25 13:44:53 Actually there’s been no inflation at all and thanks to Trump’s deregulation and two pipelines, gas prices are down over 60 days in a row. Oil is again below $45. The Fed needs 2% inflation and should be more worried about deflation right now. We need lower interest rates.
3762 2018-12-25 13:44:31 You're welcome dear
3763 2018-12-25 13:44:19 Belum periksa Ya, mau coba cari obat yg rekomen dulu. Selama ini sih baby oil aja tp gak sembuh juga.

3766 2018-12-25 13:43:57 With Christmas cheer eluding most  #investors, striking to see how far/how fast assets have moved.
Even as late as a few months ago, this configuration was thought by many as possible but highly unlikely:
Stocks in bear market territory, WTI oil below $43, 10 year UST under 2.74%

3771 2018-12-25 13:43:20 And who pays for the subsidy burden, OMC oil bonds and Iran dues which were pending in 2014. Main argument here is that, cost of crude doesn’t map 1-1 to petrol. Please check raw material impact of output product cost. These two along with variables like dollar rate will add up

3806 2018-12-25 13:37:38 Thank you. So they were exposed to external market forces and oil pricing like all the others. Must be the NPL that would be the differentiator? Were they unique in the amount of NPL exposure? Sorry. Just trying to learn.
3807 2018-12-25 13:37:37 Please keep in mind that you can't say shit slick to a can of oil #yaddddaaameeen

3819 2018-12-25 13:35:40 The effects of Jim Crow was definitely present in the 90’s because all we did was flame each other with racist phrases i.e. Tar Baby, Coon, Oil spill, Midnight, Monkey, African Booty Scratcher etc. I’m glad a lot of those are corny af now but they still sting! 
3820 2018-12-25 13:35:31 @realFemiOtedola , heard you're are pulling out of Forte Oil. We can partner in the education sector and am sure you know you won't regret it.

3823 2018-12-25 13:34:26 Use any hair oil like olive oil or coconut oil on damp hair. Applying oil or product on damp hair absorbs better.

Manufacturing jobs have been on the decline due to automation & even though some have been moved overseas due to cheap labor we never could nor would work for that amount of money in those conditions!

3831 2018-12-25 13:33:30 Not only in Price Wars do oil prices fall below MC, they also do that to prevent an all out economic recession from its major clients, meaning OECD nations. That has been OPEC-Russia policy since the summer of 2014. A far cry from its 1960 mission. Times Change-Merry

Does NASA count as non-globalist govt source?

Also it's weird to misspell a word that you put in quotation marks.

3868 2018-12-25 13:26:31 I’m not aware of Venezuela profiting from oil despite having the largest reserves in the world. Norway’s oil wealth came from nationalising all their oil assets and not spending much money in the early days. High oil prices cooinciding with high output did the rest.

3953 2018-12-25 13:12:35 Buharists have said that govt was relying on historical patterns of surge in oil prices which might repeat itself in 2019. I don't understand the ecoomic logic behind it though

3967 2018-12-25 13:11:14 So. Bit of a question that only the experienced can answer.

What are known substitutes for blood offerings in the world aside from red palm oil (which as I recall is a Tibetean association as per @Inominandum)? Do you tell the spirits "This is as good as blood."

3974 2018-12-25 13:10:34 Lol that’s irrelevant bullshit. He violated a pledge that HE CHOSE to make. 75% of his oil/gas donations were from corporate execs donating the max. You’re pulling a Trump “fake news” because you don’t like the messenger. There’s no context where violating his own pledge is ok

3988 2018-12-25 13:08:56 Why would the industry give so much more to Ted Cruz? Why would O’Rourke be first in fundraising from 40 occupations nationally but only second in oil sector? Because a third of a million Texans don’t vote as a monolithic block? Because some voters are not single issue?

4034 2018-12-25 13:03:06 I don't know about the reasons. If it was shale oil, if there is simply too much oil out there and the story of peak oil was fake news. But what I know is that there was no inflation after central banks printed billions of dollars and all asset classes rose besides oil.

4084 2018-12-25 12:55:12 Well I know of the smoke temp on oils.
Some oils, for example, olive oil may good for you in one way or another, but it's not good to cook with.

Coconut is only good up to 350f.
Generic vegi contains canola, which is a pesticide.
It also contains soy, if you care.

4097 2018-12-25 12:52:47 Friends, if I disabuse you of only one thing this Christmas Day, let it be this: if you hate sprouts, you're cooking them wrong. 

Don't boil them -- that's what kills them & turns them bitter. Grill them in the pan on the hob with a little oil, minced garlic, butter, & salt.

And like some months it took 50-60 days to provide 25% of one month salary. So 12% is a big jump again from 0%

4196 2018-12-25 12:34:33 WTI closed at 42.70 on Monday and shale oil goes for a discount of about 7.50. So the shale cos. will be getting like USD 35 for their oil. And even down here the price keeps on sinking.

4200 2018-12-25 12:34:11 babies dont shed rly as much as adult cats, if you can get them used to brushing now itll be easier when they are more grown up and they wont shed all over the house as much. good protein diets help too, fish oil in cat food helps i guess but fish isnt a great diet for cats

What’s more, fats help you stay fuller for longer, decreasing cravings and helping you.

4214 2018-12-25 12:31:53 Venezuela is a good parallel to Brexit. Both countries voted what was/is the precursor to economic disaster. Chavez relied on the oil price staying up over 100 bucks. No deal Brexit relies on WTO trade deals, equally ephemeral and uncertain.

Economically better than the arms and oil trade of the Russian economy

4340 2018-12-25 12:05:06 Prior to the ref the SNP said that they expected around £48bn in oil revenues over the next 6 years. 4 years in and it’s just over £3bn.

4343 2018-12-25 12:04:21 The famous Russian paradox: Ukraine is a failed state vs. Ukraine has plans which imply it is powerful AF. 
P.S. Ms. Zakharova forgot to mention that Ukraine in its Russophobic whim made the oil prices drop.
4344 2018-12-25 12:04:11 Retweeted (World_Oil_Price): Today I dropped badly. #Oil #Brent 50.45$ (-3.46)
4345 2018-12-25 12:04:08 So radical reforming is just in your natural DNA. People who make the difference in their life time, were made different by an innate passion and restlessness that is driven to confront racial injustices. You’ve got that oil on you my Brother. May you have joy in your world!!
4346 2018-12-25 12:04:05 Never thought of oil! I'll try that one too! TY

4348 2018-12-25 12:03:57 And you made a deal for oil to be less and cheap off another mans life but you worried about Obama
4349 2018-12-25 12:03:57 Dang! Russians r so devious

How did the Russians hack FEC & Open Secrets’ websites to make it look like Beto broke a pledge he made to accept no donations
>$200 from fossil fuel execs?

Are the Russians also responsible 4 Beto’s MANY House votes that favored the GOP & oil co’s?

4355 2018-12-25 12:02:40 If reminding you of Soros  sounds too fancy, the more immediate problem is oil which we need to feed, medicate, educate our citizens and Trudeau and crowd are using to hamstring us! We MUST stand up for ourselves! No one else will! If you're with me don't tell me, show me!
4356 2018-12-25 12:02:35 So is he a piece of shit for signing the EO to crack down harder on sex slave trade? Or is he a pos for bringing peace to North & South Korea, and halting all hostilities which nearly led to war? Is he a pos for legalizing hemp and CBD oil, which both have significant value?

4374 2018-12-25 11:59:03 Oil down to 42.55 today after being up over 72 in 2018. As we transition towards GREEN ENERGY - UNRELIABLE energy - peaks and troughs of market prices will increase and volatility will provide lots of profits to those that MANIPULATE the market.

They're taking advantage, and people claim "placebo effect" or "it at least makes them Feel better". All for false hope and a profit.

It's the same as those homeopathy people. False hope and empty promises.

4399 2018-12-25 11:54:56 It's a few hundred miles for me, otherwise I'd have been all over that. Try cutting it into small crisp sized pieced, and baking it with a little olive oil and salt.
Screw you Gary Ex-Footballer-turned-Crisp-Salesman (correct I do not know how to spell his surname).

4401 2018-12-25 11:54:27 Self styled belief? Does it really mean equality? I never heard them raising voice about gender inequality in number of school teachers, seafarers or oil rig workers. Its selective power grab agenda to intimidate companies into hiring incompetent. Its kin to reservations.

4404 2018-12-25 11:53:34 Beto is a perfect Democrat - He loses his elections but keeps it close enough to take in oil and gas donations by the hundreds of thousands before losing.
4405 2018-12-25 11:53:32 Ok, I believe in giving but giving with sense. How many bags of rice and oil can #200,000 buy. That I would get for the less privilege after I have cooked it. With animal on it. Then use #100k and share it 1k for each person. The remaining would go into forex
4406 2018-12-25 11:53:12 i heard someone mention on twitter they mix part fabric softener with water under candle light in an oil burner... ive seen it work a few times in other places but not personally tested it out
4407 2018-12-25 11:53:06 Yeah, that's my issue with them too (and every other tool that has "rubber" overmoulding, not found one that doesn't degrade quickly with oil and diesel etc, and get grubby just being handled) hence I keep them for "clean" jobs :3

4416 2018-12-25 11:50:32 Many Scandinavian nations are now struggling unfortunately.  They also all have small populations which make it much easier and in Norway's case have massive oil revenues.

Nationalisation destroyed Britain's  car industry.  I am a realist not an idealist.  And lived through it.
4417 2018-12-25 11:50:23 2. It usually boils down to oil and strategic location. Be sovereign and tell EU and Russia to stuff it. But, if I lived there and was forced to choose EU or Russia, I would pick Russia over forced "refugee" migration.
4418 2018-12-25 11:49:52 Now you get the goverment to change the oil price, right now is to pressure them to change the the system to consignment basis so that dealer is not the one that absorbing the weekly change of price. It should be the big oil companies.

4434 2018-12-25 11:46:43 That's my cheat too. I just use raw sugar, a small amount, and count that in my carbs. It's well worth it! Coffee is my drug of choice. Unless you use a large amount it's not going to impact anything! Take a teaspoon of coconut oil later in the day to offset those few carbs

4452 2018-12-25 11:43:52 Shouldn't low commodity prices be awesome for everyone that uses them as a commodity? Regarding #Oil, #Gold and everything else? #Bitcoin would be the exception, because it functions better at higher liquidity and isn't a consumable.

All is to be repaid. I see nothing for "rebuilding"

That said, their salads are good, but Asian cuisine is no-no. I couldn't imagine noodles without oil

Kuwait has very very cheap cost for oil, it is 4000 foot from ground with high pressure, Saudi Arabia 1000, other places 25000. 

If prices drop, not all producers can survive, USA companies will shut down oil production at 40.

4767 2018-12-25 10:37:48 Fracking has glutted the market with supply. The US is now a exporter, after some 69 plus years of no exports. OPEC and Russia also manipulate the oil market
4768 2018-12-25 10:37:43 And btw, keep asking for US protection is useless:
They don't give a fuck about kurds, about syria, about your revolution, about the imminent massacre.
They were there just for the oil fields, and to try to put you against Russia and Assad. They aren't your friend. They used you

4773 2018-12-25 10:36:01 The $400b GEJ took from the Malabu oil deal.

4781 2018-12-25 10:34:15 1-Erdogan is more than a culprit in what happened in Syria, as you said, buying oil from ISIS, allowing free movement to the terrorists through Turkish territories & much more. Erdogan was counting on Syrian Gov. falling apart quickly, & didn`t count on Iran & Russia stepping in.

4809 2018-12-25 10:29:44 Doing quite nicely. Oh, and we found more oil.

4916 2018-12-25 10:03:47 #Dolphin Assisted Therapy, DAT, is a scam. It is the modern snake oil. Visitors go home facing the same challenges but with less money in their pockets, and the exploited dolphins continue to suffer in cramped concrete tanks.

4934 2018-12-25 09:59:26 Yes, thats what I am thinking too. Its not about defending or not of interest but new interest have evolved or have taken shape. 
There was prediction of this since 2010, since boom of shale oil that US will not need middle east after 2020.
Vast Canadian resources are of help too
4935 2018-12-25 09:59:07 My country Norway is filthy stinking rich, we are bathing in oil and swimming in money. Our govt overseas funds and forex reserves are bigger than those of the US.

In past years, milk was either loose or in recycled bottles and oils and fats in tins. No bottled drinking water at all.
4945 2018-12-25 09:56:43 In some way i blame kenya for spearheading secession of North&south sudan under the guise of "peace" only so we could exploit their oil, well the deal failed the oil never reached our borders due to corruption our oil exploration programe. Intended LAPSET development failed too

4950 2018-12-25 09:55:40 The divesting of Femi Otedola's interest in Forte oil teaches me that no matter the success attained, you must never settle or get too comfortable. This strategic sale is to invest in refining hence aiming higher by taking on more risks but the consequent effect will be immense.

4988 2018-12-25 09:50:28 The funniest thing is that same people liking this and retweeting were the ones that liked, re tweet, endorsed, bully and made fun of that boy.
The peak of hypocrisy on Arewa twitter is lewdly putrid  henceforth we'll be mobbing any bully.
4989 2018-12-25 09:50:25 I think that’s absolutely back to front and contradicts itself.

I don’t think kids need to be “stopped” - they can enjoy these within a balanced diet.

Year round Jamie calls for “a glug of olive oil” (whatever a “glug” is) and pours in half a mugfull at 120kcals per tablespoon.

WINNIPEG, Manitoba/VANCOUVER — A decade ago, Canada’s oil sector was growing so fast it was predicted to become a global energy superpower, but a series of political misstep…

He also took money from Big Oil, backing out of the pledge not to take special interest donations. 
Also, his alliance with AIPAC is problematic, especially for Palestinians.

5226 2018-12-25 09:07:11 Thats too negative and too nihilistic a view on currency. Look at how Norway has used its surplus from oil sales to create a sovereign weslth fund. You are simply lacking in imagination as to how a surplus can be used.

5415 2018-12-25 08:26:26 Unless pending future contracts we'd negotiated before the  slump in prices for our oil grades are in the 60s for now I'll say we are not in trouble. And it's better for buyers to lock in at low prices. Expectations are if OPEC can keep their cut, prices might increase. I pray o!
5416 2018-12-25 08:26:24 Yeah, the problem isn’t that no one’s buying Venezuelan oil/gas. The problem is that the nationalisation of their oil/gas industry led to a massive drop in its production. Buy as much as you like...they still can’t afford to pay the workers.

5431 2018-12-25 08:22:16 My issue is when they called their emergency FEC meeting before the budget presentation, was hoping they'd review the benchmark. They unfortunately didn't. Coupled with the fact that our cost of production is one of the highest in the world so a low oil regime isn't nice at all.

5467 2018-12-25 08:12:38 Its not because of the PH government, it’s because of the lower global oil price. Their election promise is 1.50 per litre no matter what. It is yet to be fulfilled.

5659 2018-12-25 07:35:47 Why would Putin allow Turkey to occupy major part of Syria? Its gas and oil fields? Turkey has 300 km to go to ISIS frontline when SAA is nearby. This is great opportunity to Putin/Assad to get control of Syrian territory but they have to give little self government to kurds.

5731 2018-12-25 07:19:24 Personally I see declines at least until the next Fed meeting in January,
Maybe a short term "bounce" but it will probably be a very soft one just like the Oil market.
Might be a few more down days too before we see a bounce, especially in the absence of "Good news".

The Oil market might be front running the stock market here,
Over leveraged companies expanding far beyond the decreasing consumer demand/growth.

5752 2018-12-25 07:16:59 The question the western governments should ask itself is whether oil politics is more important than the lives of 200 million people less than 2000km from Europe. Nigeria's problem is going to be Europe's problem first and foremost.

He led the case against Exxon Mobil after an large oil spill. I wondered if you two had crossed paths?

Thanks.

5757 2018-12-25 07:15:15 O’Rourke received $430,000 from individuals working in the oil and gas industry,  75 percent of which he received in the form of a donation over $200.  There were 29 large donations from fossil fuel (executives).

5760 2018-12-25 07:14:44 I’m in favor of local governments having a say over their own natural resources. Why can’t we manage global oil better? Money and gods.
5761 2018-12-25 07:14:28 u can also cut it in bigger slabs and bake it in the oven with maple syrup soy sauce a lil oil some herbs and sesame seeds my mom does that and its rly tasty… as long as you season it well u cant rly go wrong cooking it!
5762 2018-12-25 07:14:13 Taking the pledge, led by Oil Change USA, means politicians will not knowingly take contributions of over $200 from“the PACs, executives or front groups of fossil fuel companies companies whose primary business is the extraction processing, distribution or sale of oil gas or coal
5763 2018-12-25 07:14:12 yes, because dozens of the donations were actually from executives in the max allowed amount for an individual ($2700). we have 12 years to move to entirely renewable energy, so any oil&gas money concerns me. and since 500k is so little of his funds, he could've returned it!

5881 2018-12-25 06:45:53 So, the reduced prices might be demand reduction not resulting in reduced production. This doesn't augur well for OPEC. Considering oil producing countries exporting terror also, reduced money flow to them may result in reduction of terror

5893 2018-12-25 06:44:14 I ruined my thanksgiving turkey, so trying it again today, the xmas turkey!  Why is there so much water in the pan?? I only added some oil??? Never had that happen before, although maybe because I baked it for 4 1/2 hours!! heheh wink
5894 2018-12-25 06:44:08 You people were right to demand better than PDP,

Problem is you turned to a party that was filled with snake oil salesmen who sought to demonize the ruling party at every turn, with everything and had skeletons in their cupboards (cough Funsho Williams' assassination and co)
5895 2018-12-25 06:44:03 Omgosh! I've heard coconut oil works so well for ppl but my combination skin doesn't mesh with it. I used to oil cleanse w it. I'm so glad it works for you!!
5896 2018-12-25 06:43:52 Nigeria has done a poor job of managing ALL its resources. Not just oil but land, water, people. How can you grow an economy with hoe-and-machete farming? Or with the rotten level of education? My 70+ year old relations write better english than our university grads today.

5982 2018-12-25 06:27:30 It also ignores that many of the votes were procedural & another chunk were Beto to the left of the party. Sirota just has an unhealthy obsession w/Beto. He painted Beto as a oil and gas shill, when Beto has a better voting score with the League of Conservation voter than Bernie.

You can go decades without a devastating earthquake. With Alberta's practices the boom and bust cycle is far more routine.

Its also much easier to prevent the economic disasters than earthquakes.

6033 2018-12-25 06:17:29 Out here, in Alberta, we sort of noticed confederation was broken. No, it's not the $13B in equalization, it's when, after having received the $13B in equalization payments, the premier of Quebec says he doesn't want dirty Alberta oil going through his province. That is broken.

6081 2018-12-25 06:07:36 But based on the fact that Beto received more money than any other candidate in 2018... doesn't that just mean that he is popular in general? Why narrow in on the oil and gas industry?
6082 2018-12-25 06:07:30 Y'all so I got a nifty little oil diffuser for Christmas, sounds kinda meh but JUST YOU WAIT. This bad boy has rainbow lights that I can change and it has A FREAKING BLUETOOTH SPEAKER.

6093 2018-12-25 06:04:43 It tells me that Beto is popular among people in the oil and gas industry.

6126 2018-12-25 05:59:34 Think they need oil to move lower so inflation expectations and ISM come down, then rates will follow. Maybe Trump bailing out the saudis and asking for increased pumping is short term pain, but causes fed to reinflate?

6163 2018-12-25 05:53:41 And sure, Koch isn’t just about oil. It’s about profit from a variety of things, but fossil fuels are a major factor in the massive Koch wealth. Just because Koch industries do things not directly related to massive CO2 emissions doesn’t make them honest about AGW. Try thinking.

There was no sensible probe from them why FG based the budget on an oil price that is higher than the current value.

6175 2018-12-25 05:52:36 First figure out what percentage of crude oil price contributed to the overall cost of fuel. Then add other cost like refining, transportation, profit to agents and taxes. You will automatically understand why prices can’t drop at the same proportion of global crude oil price.
6176 2018-12-25 05:52:02 PSA don’t get your oil changed at @walmarthelp !!!! Instead of putting my bolts back on my splash shield they used zip ties and didn’t even tell me! Worst service ever!!!

6305 2018-12-25 05:29:32 Yes. He has cut the corporate income tax rate from the world's highest rate of 35% down to 21%. He has also eliminated regulations that throttle the Free Market in a 22:1 ratio. He has also unleashed our energy sector which has now led us to being an oil exporter, not importer.

6307 2018-12-25 05:29:07 No. The end game is to put good people in place that will effectively work to better the causes of the people. Sure, replacing the dickhead in the White House is part of that. But replacing him with some oil and Wall Street puppet is not going to get it done either.

for that Modi should take courage.

For whose benefit?

And who thought it a good idea to spend trillions to achieve this?

Hence OPEC ‘production cuts’ always a false narrative when oil price drops.

6448 2018-12-25 05:04:00 2/ Beto has a huge opportunity.  He's from an oil and gas state.  He's accepted a lot of donations from people in the industry.  (It's TX, so no big surprise.)  He also gets high marks from League of Conservation voters.  Those two things invite questions re energy policy.
6449 2018-12-25 05:03:47 But again, not defending Beto but calling out Sirota. He “ignores” facts to make his point clean. His record isn’t clean. Look no further than Venezuela. Ignored the fact oil was the driving factor of their economic gains in 13. We know the out come now

6451 2018-12-25 05:03:13 Could you further define “oil and gas executives”?
6452 2018-12-25 05:03:12 No, it’s inertia which makes the world go around.

Knowing what we do about global climate change, the people employed by the oil and gas industries are actually bad.
6453 2018-12-25 05:02:07 Drop in Phenol prices are directly related with drop in crude oil prices so ultimately there is no impact margin because raw material price correction is also 25-30%. There may be some losses on old raw material inventory which is bought at higher price.

6469 2018-12-25 04:59:10 Also, standing up to the fossil fuel industry is very, very, crucially important right now. Taking large individual donations from oil exec donors matter. And his campaign wasn’t hurting for money.
6470 2018-12-25 04:59:03 Do you raise the same objections to people singing Beto’s praises? It seems to me that if people are getting excited about him running it’s fair to look at his funding and votes, especially if he is breaking pledges to not take oil exec money.

6505 2018-12-25 04:53:50 We are the so called poverty capital because it is not by abracadabra you lift people out of poverty. It is a long term process of deliberate investment in infrastructure and diversification from oil, which this government has been doing, and yielding fruit...

When any Democratic candidate stands for 80% clean and 100% renewable energy by 2030 (and they will), it's worth keeping oil riggers employed until they are retrained to assemble solar.

6516 2018-12-25 04:51:42 “Oil Money” implies taking money from industry representatives, is PACs and lobbyist donations. It’s not remotely the same as what the story implies.
6517 2018-12-25 04:51:38 He made a pledge to not take money from fossil fuel execs and then he broke it. His votes reveal him to be a pretty typical Wall Street Dem happy to give away the store to oil companies and others. It’s not that complicated.
6518 2018-12-25 04:51:28 Win is temporary. The environmental impact is forever. Our oil workers need to adapt and be provided with training in renewable energy.

6525 2018-12-25 04:50:19 Very interesting, I haven't seen many people attributing this to oil yet. The initial selling in October was blamed on higher interest rates and since then it has just shifted from one thing to another... Not sure if oil is the real driver or simply falling victim too.

6535 2018-12-25 04:48:42 I think this environmental debate is not even well understood there is a lot of hype around it.

6605 2018-12-25 04:37:11 Depends on whether the CAD goes down against the USD faster than Gold. Oil may be about to bounce and therefore CAD too. Gold could run into trouble here at $1272 resistance or slightly higher at 1293, especially if/when stocks rally.

6611 2018-12-25 04:36:23 I consider him a progressive. He supports universal healthcare. He doesn't take PAC money, This BS about supporting the oil industry is crap. He took money from oil workers which is most of Texas not the big wigs. People get to wound up on the stupid shit.
6612 2018-12-25 04:36:16 The whole basis to the Federal Court of Appeals decision has to do with oil tanker traffic, the impact to the environment and the lack of consultation with the people who’s waters and coastline borders the Trans Mountain expansion. You can’t just go around that decision.

6615 2018-12-25 04:35:34 Also, my main issue with Sirota is that he cults hard. Also the story in question re O’Rourke is devoid of context and nuance, and therefore useless for informing one’s choice at the ballot box unless your worldview is limited to “DEATH PENALTY FOR HAVING ANYTHING TO DO WITH OIL”

6629 2018-12-25 04:33:41 Speaking generally, a snake oil salesmen can give people utility as well as long as people buy the con. Even if short lived. It doesn't mean we should just ignore them. Thinking like this gives wholesale support to any con man as long as people believe they are being helped.
6630 2018-12-25 04:33:31 With Indian Economy so much dependent on oil, our government s should have taken a lead on electrical vehicles r&d, funding, subsidy, manufacturing and usage. Alas we cannot take care of our problems.

6637 2018-12-25 04:32:08 Can't quite comprehend the notion that politicians with oil industry constituents can't act on climate change. Pretty sure nobody wants their kids to die in the prequel to Mad Max, regardless of the job they have.

6640 2018-12-25 04:31:31 Yup. If the facts won't fit, shave them down. The important thing in journalism is not to assess a reality, but to serve the political agenda. Hey, congrats, you just justified everything Fox News has ever done in mirror image of your ethos for Big Oil and Wall Street.

6649 2018-12-25 04:30:05 Yeah am not oil expert but seems like no one wants it.  Which makes me intrigued.  Mad i covered uwt way too early.

6653 2018-12-25 04:29:37 The market always prices in everything, but recession or not, there is actually not enough new production coming on-line to replace the natural depletion happening, and oil is not a want, but a must in much of the world. But yes, there is probably a recession on its way.

6661 2018-12-25 04:28:25 A series of PSA,s detailing progress would be good. I want to see it with my own eyes without driving there.

6672 2018-12-25 04:27:18 Oil is below 50, down to 42 level. We're on pretty bear level here. Almost 50% to recover back to where it was. Can that be pulled off in 2019? Pretty tough.

Hope you’ve had a moderate day. I know how much today sucks for you. Miss you always.
6675 2018-12-25 04:27:10 Context tells us that if the two Senate candidates in Texas in a heavily funded race don't pull 1 & 2 from oil industry, something is crazy. And the tell is that O'Rourke is also No. 1 pulling $ from every fucking type of voter regardless of occupation. DS avoids this context.

6677 2018-12-25 04:26:44 Yes.. Oil and ES are a bit out of hand...
6678 2018-12-25 04:26:30 By contrast I CAN argue that overall Beto favors big oil and has not shown seriousness regarding the reversal of Climate Change.
6679 2018-12-25 04:26:30 Thanks! I’m def going to try out coconut oil but my dogs love to eat it so that’ll be interesting 
6680 2018-12-25 04:25:50 I think he is just mad that his country is in a uproar because of oil prices.

6682 2018-12-25 04:25:37 Make a note- apply nipple cream of some sort (coconut oil,lanolin,etc) BEFORE and AFTER you pump. Lube those nips up.
6683 2018-12-25 04:25:23 I tried to diffuse essential oils today. Turns out I diffused the oil meant for teething, not the flu. 
6684 2018-12-25 04:25:18 i shampoo and condition. i also recommend an oil or cream like “lion tamer”
6685 2018-12-25 04:25:07 A cream or cream to oil cleanser always works for me. Think Ponds cold cream or Bliss gel to oil cleanser or Clinique take the day off.
6686 2018-12-25 04:24:59 Imagine what he’d say to a little Jewish kid about the price of oil- he’s an equal opportunity creep.

6690 2018-12-25 04:24:23 How long does oil take to go bad? I believe it's wise to always  store at least five liters at home.
6691 2018-12-25 04:24:17 That's true..the first phase of oil selloff was mostly supply concerns (iranian sanction waivers) but this last leg is just tracking equities as if they signal weakening demand. These prices have real world consequences for oil though & could be setting up a squeeze down the line

6694 2018-12-25 04:23:38 Doesn't irritate mine at all. As for damaging coarse hair,i don't know about that. I have the strange brown/black/red beard hair, which is very coarse. As long it still has moisture in it and oil applied to it, with the dryer far eniugh away, it does great.

Of course, Cruz with the actual industry money? No. 1. Meanwhile O'Rourke also No. 1 in 40 other industries.

6706 2018-12-25 04:21:36 She's worse even than that. She has stated publicly, during her time working for Hillary, that wars for oil are a good thing - as long as we get the oil. So human lives lost in bloody wars mean nothing to her where money is concerned.

6709 2018-12-25 04:20:48 Bernie was the number one choice of workers in Defense Aerospace. Personally, I don’t think they makes him a war-hawk, but under your analysis of Beto and oil and gas workers (of whom there are many in Texas), I guess it’s incriminating.

6757 2018-12-25 04:12:45 The Pc’s pissed away the oil royalties and continually lie to gullable wannabe AB conservatives about how they are the only ones that can do anything for the province. When oil started to tank 4 years ago and Albertans were losing their jobs Harper did nothing. Trudeau did.

6761 2018-12-25 04:12:10 it certainly appears so. The thing that's been really crazy to me lately is crude oil. Crude oil is needed in mining metals, so one would almost suspect that the negative crude numbers should've been hurting metals, but it hasn't...

6766 2018-12-25 04:11:21 I have zero proof. It just smells funny but your posts enlightened me to the details behind Beto’s funding especially the percentage of total campaign from Oil.

6771 2018-12-25 04:10:55 Whatever we are going to do is going to require a massive mobilization of scientists, engineers, vehicle makers, and construction to make whatever is deemed the best solution. This won't happen as long as we are subsidizing the fossil fuel industry, fighting wars or oil...

6837 2018-12-25 04:01:33 And there it is. "Money from oil and gas companies" That's what wasn't done, but of course, the intentional ambiguity of Sirota's reportage has you repeating the falsehood. Quite the tell. And I'm saying this unaligned with Beto or Bernie or anyone; the reporting is shit.
6838 2018-12-25 04:01:31 Okay. Well, in my opinion, the US would not care one bit about the Kurds if they didn't occupy valuable oil land the US oil companies would like to exploit (like Iraq and Golan), and they provide a cover for US troops to stay in Syria to counter Hezbollah for Israel.
6839 2018-12-25 04:01:24 So exactly how does he heat his workshop and home? How does he obtain food for his reindeer and elfs? How do they cook it? Solar panels don't work when there's no sun and windmills aren't reliable. So Santa uses oil to make plastic toys, heat his home, & feed his workers & fleet

6895 2018-12-25 03:54:37 So it's necessary and inevitable to take money from oil and gas companies and pass irredeemably diluted half-measures when we need radical change on energy policy? That doesn't really square with anything that's won the left enduring power in America.

7079 2018-12-25 03:30:26 Oil sank another 6% overnight. I’m very surprised that we are still not increasing taxes on fuel. Pump prices have room to fall another 20%. Politics over economics :/ 
Crude so low can mean good room to tax and help the fisc, both the centre and states.

I guess staying strengthens relations with France and England who are also there and enhances our influence in the region, plus helping innocent non-americans, and stabilizing oil prices.

So using the federal power to ensure KM their pipeline would be built would have saved $4.5b tax dollars, & $20b would have been invested in CDA. C-48 & regs for AB oil have chased billions in investment away & we still buy SA oil. JT is to blame for all of this.

Oil up and rates go up. And lately oil taking its lead from equities.

7200 2018-12-25 03:12:04 Saudi Arabia has the second most valuable natural resources in the world and with the 2030 vision, they're looking to diverse the independence from oil to other economic resources such as tourism.

We got the codes and made it 60ish miles home, so at least we can get a second opinion.

7602 2018-12-25 02:04:07 Schumer - what you need is a good power wash enema all the way up to your brain. You were for the wall and now against it. Democrats are as solid as jello in olive oil.

7620 2018-12-25 02:01:08 FDR was determined to get us into WW2, froze Japan's money and assets, embargo on oil etc. Japan retaliated. Throughout history our presidents have gotten us into wars, this one is getting us out. 9/11 has never made sense, good to know it is getting attention.

7647 2018-12-25 01:55:56 I’m glad you used the oil 
7648 2018-12-25 01:55:43 Don’t disagree I just find your characterization of oil and gas workers as these salt of the earth 30k a year types fucking hilarious
7649 2018-12-25 01:55:40 That was the ugliest reminder that I cant skip another day for an oil change.
7650 2018-12-25 01:55:39 Most unmerry Christmas ever..!! Oil's been shocking..!!  It'll have it's repercussions on our markets too.. A sad close to the year.

7652 2018-12-25 01:55:06 Heat the coconut oil and pour in the kernels. Put the lid on the pot and giver a few shakes while it pops.  Pour it in a bowl and melt your butter in the hot pot.. over the top.  Add salt.  I can do it in my sleep!  The best!!

7657 2018-12-25 01:54:37 Yeah, that’s exactly how mine used to be. It could be the dry shampoo adding to the issue. Try corn starch to soak up oil on your off days. You may get another day in between. It took a long time to get mine to wednesdays and sundays
7658 2018-12-25 01:54:36 No it's not the other way around. Israel is a client state the receives money from the US in order to carry out dirty work. One of the main functions is to secure Middle East oil for American oil companies.
7659 2018-12-25 01:54:27 2019 is going to be a year of pushing my art to the limit. I have a goal of 100 paintings. I am going to do more oil paintings. I am going to do more original paintings. I am going to enter at least one competition. I am going bigger, better, farther. #Art

7664 2018-12-25 01:53:24 That money came from workers lol. A person working at a oil company that makes 30,000 a year and donates $10 is counted as oil money. Find a reason that makes sense, such as his votes on Wall Street. It’s not hard to find actual reasons and not bs

7680 2018-12-25 01:50:18 Yes but their policies exist only because of the oil.  Pointing out Norway as an example for any other country is unrealistic.  The amount of natural resource per person is above any other country.
7681 2018-12-25 01:50:12 We still pop it in a pot, on the stove except we use coconut oil. Best popcorn ever.
7682 2018-12-25 01:50:05 That's right.
We don't have time.
We need to know who is stuck on the oil teat and beholden to oil executives. 
Please keep going.

The Kurds, in Northern Iraq, share a border with Turkey which would love to move down to access their oil. The Kurds can protect themselves but need American arms and funding. But Trump luvs Turkey!
7702 2018-12-25 01:47:20 The oil and gas resources aren't gathered through the strip mines.
7703 2018-12-25 01:46:52 I’m afraid no one wants to help the Kurds - Turkey fears them - Syria fears them - they have no oil, no reason to anyone to support them - honor and decency don’t enter into the equation - this is real politik

7730 2018-12-25 01:41:18 I’m afraid none of these countries dominate the worlds oil supply - nice people though in general. Countries are not “friends” - rather they align along common interests as needed - Kissinger was a master at this - I’m afraid Trump is an amateur - but he does like money...

Billions of dollars have left Canada, oil and pot are two commodities that he has bungled. 100,000 Albertans out of work, and you elitists living in a bubble down East have no clue, your opinion is in the minority. You probably believe in the UN compact as well.

“He’s a weak person’s idea of a strong man,
A poor person’s idea of a rich man,
And a stupid person’s idea of a smart man.”
All true. He’s a sham, a grifter, and a snake oil salesman. The man fails in every conceivable way. #DowJones

7814 2018-12-25 01:26:47 Is that the whole endgame with Syria...get Iran out? Doesn't make much sense. I'm not getting why Russia is even involved with Syria, what does Putin get out of it? Is this all about who gets the oil, because impoverishing an entire country seems a bit extreme for that!
7815 2018-12-25 01:26:43 I advise the same path for a shaved face as well, minus the balm. Brushing helps prevent ingrown hairs, the oil makes the fresh stubble smooth and soft, keeps the skin healthy. 
It's a cheap investment.
7816 2018-12-25 01:26:37 @ god explain how my skin is sensitive as hell and reacts poorly to almost everything but is able to tolerate daily direct contact with tea tree oil, which can give other ppl fucking chemical burns?
7817 2018-12-25 01:26:27 I come back home and suddenly my whole family is using CBD oil talking about how there’s two parts to the leaf
7818 2018-12-25 01:26:09 Very similar to mine. I like to boil with some olive oil in the mix. Mash with skin on, add garlic, a little more olive oil, milk, and butter.
7819 2018-12-25 01:25:58 Only partly true, it's because of their policies & rule of law that make Norway Inc rich, as the essay says most oil rich states squander or are robbed by elites so those states stays poor.

7852 2018-12-25 01:20:44 Yup, and my point is we can ill afford a presidential candidate who is at all beholden to the fossil fuel industry. I have 2 inviolate policies for 2020 - money out of politics and aggressively addressing the climate crisis. Pro-business centrists with oil ties are right out.
7853 2018-12-25 01:20:40 Gay media promote the narrative heavily. Its telling that non gay media (the Times et al) could report on Martina-gate truthfully.

It makes you wonder what snake oil they need to sell. This is rainbow capitalism. They NEED LGB people to believe the shit.

And most... Don't.

7860 2018-12-25 01:19:37 Rt, I’m Jewish, I do not condone anything Israel does. And, I do not support them. It drives me insane all these evangelicals supporting Israel. If they knew why the republicans supported Israel (because it’s the express way for oil) and not just supported it bc they are sheep
7861 2018-12-25 01:19:30 We got plenty of jobs in oil and gas down here in Texas. Salute to all the hard working Canadians. Been in this business for 4 years as a refinery operator we hire left and right on the Gulf coast.
7862 2018-12-25 01:19:18 OMG Tea tree oil memang jadiiiii
7863 2018-12-25 01:19:06 オイルだって怒るんだぞ怒ったら引火してギトギトのボーボーにしてやるからな
7864 2018-12-25 01:19:02 So you want us to keep fighting over other country? You want us to keep taking all of their oil when we have ours? Tell your friends or family or whoever, go sneak into that country and go fight them. You can go war yourself
7865 2018-12-25 01:19:01 You were right about the interest rates hikes depression the stock market. I believe with the past eight years of low interest rates from the recession, put the market into a bubble. Super genius from the Fed just pop it. Now Wall Street, oil and people with 401k will be losing.
7866 2018-12-25 01:18:54 Update: I put too much peppermint oil in my bath and my entire body feels super cool haha. I’m all bundled up under a blanket because it’s too much hahah #atleastilaughed

7868 2018-12-25 01:18:28 No. You MUST abandon the wall if We were conned into believing Mexico will pay for it. So go back to your crooked drawing board.  Or get your rich oil friends to pay for it.

BJP govt under PM Modi has inaugurated the Paradip Oil Refinery & laid the foundation of Paradip- Hyderabad pipeline of Indian Oil Corp which will not only strengthen Odisha’s energy sector but will also boost employment & investment in the region

7872 2018-12-25 01:17:59 So us pulling out is actually  great thing for Truimp ally Russia.  They can control Middle East oil flow with no US interference.  Makes sense now.
7873 2018-12-25 01:17:52 Russia is buying Venezuela oil and moving their weapons closer to America. Trump has sold out America. Get ready for war.
7874 2018-12-25 01:17:38 Opinion: Canada and US Agriculture will push to collapse crude oil price to 40 dollar per barrel and will not let it rise further. Ethanol to be use to stretch crude oil price in 2019. @ENERGY @TexasDeptofAg @USDA @Pemex @petrobras

7876 2018-12-25 01:17:07 Chef McElroy cut up some carrots, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a dictionary, along with hot sauce.
7877 2018-12-25 01:17:05 "you don't eat butter? What you eat Olive oil??" Christmas 2018
7878 2018-12-25 01:16:44 Mr. President, Mexico as a country can't survive without U.S. remittances, they are the first source of Mexican economy income, above oil, mining, agriculture...impose the remittances tax to fund border security and wall. 
You can do it and Mexico will be paying for the wall.
7879 2018-12-25 01:16:32 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?

7884 2018-12-25 01:15:42 Our President is burning the Christmas Eve oil for America.
You are giving the U.S. a great present, Sir.  Thank you for taking on this Country with all of its problems.
7885 2018-12-25 01:15:30 That is why Qatar has discontinued oil sales in favour of gas.

7889 2018-12-25 01:14:47 4/“To settle the bill, China gets to keep 80 percent of Ecuador’s most valuable export — oil — because many of the contracts are repaid in petroleum, not dollars. In fact, China gets the oil at a discount, then sells it for an additional profit”
7890 2018-12-25 01:14:33 Can coconut oil be used instead of dairy free butter?
7891 2018-12-25 01:14:29 Imagine Trump roaming naked and covered in olive oil.... Why?  Can you NOT imagine it now???
7892 2018-12-25 01:14:10 Thanks.  Fair enough.  In truth I don't know much about what Beto has done as a lawmaker.  What has he done to advance laws that will respond to climate change - say, building renewable energy, electrifying transportation and phasing out coal, oil and gas by law?
7893 2018-12-25 01:14:09 H8884498189 Hertz reservation. The 2 cars, 1 needed an oil change and 1 a hub cap . A woman drove  from Washington and the hubcap came off on the trip.

7897 2018-12-25 01:13:38 GSP has been caught cheating buddy. He was bathing in oil before his fights so his skin would be too slick to hold on to. 

Grease gate... 

Everyone tries to get a little ahead of their competition.
7898 2018-12-25 01:13:23 Uhmm ... didn’t PM Trudeau just buy the oil sands their very own pipeline? You call that indifference? Or perhaps Canada should just ignore court rulings, aboriginal peoples and environmental studies and build pipelines wherever the oil companies want to? #cdnpoli #skpoli

7900 2018-12-25 01:12:56 Of course he did!   Remember the saudis were going to pump more oil?   No.  The whole world including China is slowly tumbling into a recession so there’s now a glut of oil appearing.
7901 2018-12-25 01:12:50 You still buy gas, oil changes, new tires, new windows etc. terrible example lmaooo
7902 2018-12-25 01:12:48 I looked at her and suddenly the smell of olive oil hit me.
7903 2018-12-25 01:12:45 And those folks usually have more money than the wealthy individuals who vote blue. Sure, the entertainment industry is filled with wealthy liberals... but, um... have you ever heard of the oil industry? Many more of them. Much wealthier. Not on TV.
7904 2018-12-25 01:12:37 Ron Paul on @CNN " Empire is well entrenched bi-partisan , lot to do about Oil and Military Industrial Complex ....is why you don't see or hear @RonPaul much on Cable "news".

7908 2018-12-25 01:11:56 Indeed - there is a 12 founder in my fridge that is getting a hot peanut oil bath tomorrow!
7909 2018-12-25 01:11:53 Let’s see oil is down, companies are buying back stocks & they received tax breaks from @realDonaldTrump he just announced we are pulling out of   and Syria! 17 years in  and the market doesn’t like it?? The 1% & the WAR MACHINE don’t like it! #NoMoreWar #WakeUpAmerica

7914 2018-12-25 01:11:14 Olive oil. The best way!
7915 2018-12-25 01:11:11 I usually just crank it to the temp specified on the cooking oil bottle, which is never more than 500. But I burn shit all the time and it makes me NUTS
7916 2018-12-25 01:10:58 The CRM treasure chest is worth its weight in oil!
7917 2018-12-25 01:10:54 Pretty sure in my original tweet, I wrote the Russian government depends on oil for revenue.  I guess I should have written "a vast majority" of their revenue.  Would that have been better?
7918 2018-12-25 01:10:53 argon oil be having me feeling like butter
7919 2018-12-25 01:10:51 I, ironically, have actually been a swan in swan lake. Not the classical version of course. Attempting to suggest that oil is renewable due to "renewing" itself over millenia.... is he serious?
7920 2018-12-25 01:10:48 I mixed coconut oil, Grapeseed oil, Jojoba oil, and Vitamin E oil to use on my hair daily and it has helped my hair to grow faster. Deep conditioning after every wash (cowash too) is a must and drink plenty of water

7925 2018-12-25 01:09:14 They need to negotiate lines of territory. Get rid of terrorist parties and bring peace to all. Could be very beneficial to all there. Oil a big profit if they could use it for the good of all there not just the privledged.

7927 2018-12-25 01:08:53 @gay_jupiter the car needed oil, you were right!!!!! You are a Christmas angel 
7928 2018-12-25 01:08:52 An oil pipeline, that's what's at stake. Do you think the Russians would just lay down and do nothing if we cut off their cash flow?
7929 2018-12-25 01:08:38 เหนื่อยมากแล้ว..
7930 2018-12-25 01:08:36 Putting lavender essential oil on my pashmina last night before I wore it on the plane today was one of the greatest ideas I’ve ever had
7931 2018-12-25 01:08:32 Where did science, religion and oil industry come from out of this conversation? At this point, I might just use the method of calling you a political bot.
7932 2018-12-25 01:08:30 @IAMSAFAREE bitch why is Onika name still coming out your mouth. RESPECT THE WOMAN WHO MADE YOU! Humble yourself, and go get that hairline touched up crisco cooking oil man
7933 2018-12-25 01:08:28 That is because the price of crude has gone down by $30 in last 1 month. As of today market close it was at $42 per barrel of crude oil. Please share full story rather then play a political game.
7934 2018-12-25 01:08:10 Try reading the article, ma'am. It talks about how Beto has voted. You can also note that he was the second largest recipient of oil industry donations, and had to remove himself from his fossil fuel pledge. Perhaps you'd like to try a little reading yourself. ;)
7935 2018-12-25 01:08:03 I coat myself in olive oil, during my showers then I lotion myself when I’m finished lol I don’t see where body butter would come in at
7936 2018-12-25 01:07:05 If the west no longer sourced oil from Middle East
instead used oil from AU+USA 
and looked into bio-oil + Hyderon fuel cells
and swapped coal power for nuclear 

Would the west "need" to even deal with the Middle East ever again ?

7962 2018-12-25 01:02:38 Nope, still wrong on so many levels. Try reading actual cases. And Venezuela has not been killed by socialist dogma. Venezuela has been killed by massive sanctions stopping it from selling it's oil at market value. Venezuela has the biggest oil reserves in the world..
7963 2018-12-25 01:02:09 Look at the two Trump towers in Istanbul and you know whats the main reason. This man is a snake oil salesman, a crook and a cheat. You should know better than us from EU which options are left.
7964 2018-12-25 01:02:04 Yea I agree with you. Definitely no crisis / systemic like crisis. It’s not as leveraged and to your point, it’s several magnitude smaller. I think worth observing the credit spreads this time around - high yield is starting to rumble (likely due to oil price decline).

8001 2018-12-25 00:55:56 No one has ever asked for my ID and Boarding Pass before I reached the TSA security line. In a hot airport, the person is button up 2 his neck. Oil r similar n a shapeless quilt coat. Gone b4 reaching the TSA podium. Told uniformed police officer,  who went on brake.  WTF
8002 2018-12-25 00:55:41 Wow. My relatives love CBD oil. Huh.
8003 2018-12-25 00:55:28 Well I officially can breathe after dousing myself in vapor rub and a lot of olbus oil. #MerryChristmas2018
8004 2018-12-25 00:55:24 So, for Christmas, I give my advice to you and start make up for what you done, even when you have to stop and remove your oil mining operations out from our public lands and coasts, and become a even better president for everyone, especially if have to apologize for your wrongs

8013 2018-12-25 00:52:50 I criticized Sheehan. I think she’s a moron. To say we fought in Iraq for oil is idiocy. Buying oil is far cheaper than going to war over it.
8014 2018-12-25 00:52:44 姪っ子が小学生の頃「メリークリスマス」って言ったら「アメリカでは宗教的な配慮からハッピーホリデーって言うんだよ」って言われて「お前日本住んでんじゃん！」ってムキになった思い出。

8016 2018-12-25 00:52:04 And snake oil cures baldness.

8022 2018-12-25 00:49:02 That looks suspiciously like rapeseed oil and not goose fat, so are these even roast potatoes?

over and above their crude oil production.

Tax this money 50% and build the wall, President Trump
8026 2018-12-25 00:48:02 my bf said my eyes look like synthetic motor oil 
8027 2018-12-25 00:47:58 Watched the @LaBeautyologist video...I believe I have oily-dehydrated (combo?) sensitive skin. 

I currently have a micellar water cleanser, glycolic acid drops, a serum & a moisturizer w/hyaluronic acid, witch hazel, an avocado+oatmeal clay mask & almond+jojoba oil. I'm...
8028 2018-12-25 00:47:38 Takes a few months for the spigots to shut. Oil price fall will be felt, especially during budgeting season
8029 2018-12-25 00:47:22 I’m honestly sick of like every single candy using Palm oil

8031 2018-12-25 00:47:14 Free power? Perpetual motion snake oil...
8032 2018-12-25 00:46:55 I probably should’ve done the oil change first that would’ve been a lot more faster. It’s cool I’ll get it done after Xmas
8033 2018-12-25 00:46:47 It all still boils down to interest and the parents. 
I kill chicken in the house, my brother doesn't. 
I wash car, check the oil guage and radiator and can change tires when necessary. 

So..
8034 2018-12-25 00:46:14 Public transport is a great option.

But, people, who can afford a car and oil, for them time is more precious.

With people coming out of poverty, first they will buy home, then something, and at some point, a car. 

Like even having computer, laptops people opted for smartphone
8035 2018-12-25 00:46:13 I’m hoping 2019 Brent crude, the global oil benchmark will average just over $69 a barrel in 2019 Crude prices have dropped by more than 30% since hitting four-year high at the start of October
8036 2018-12-25 00:46:06 So I was supposed do an oil change and change the spark plugs but I was missing a tool I needed and it fcked up my whole day smh, I had to put everything back together just cs I was missing that hoe 
8037 2018-12-25 00:46:00 So yeah it works but it doesn't care which hairs and nails it thickens. Some people break out from it but drinking more water and doing an oil cleanse every week or so helps a lot
8038 2018-12-25 00:45:58 I’m hoping 2019 Brent crude, the global oil benchmark will average just over $69 a barrel in 2019 Crude prices have dropped by more than 30% since hitting four-year high at the start of October

8041 2018-12-25 00:45:08 But due to what you did, like clear out the public lands for your oil drill operation which is end up pollute the air we breath and the water we drink and threaten the wildlife close to extinction, which may also why everyone is get very upset about you threatened our very planet
8042 2018-12-25 00:45:06 My wife jumped on the oil bandwagon awhile back and I was skeptical (by skeptical I mean I called them snake oils) but I will say whether it is psychological or not some of them do seem to do what they say. I.e. calming, relaxing, muscle rub works, and some just smell good
8043 2018-12-25 00:45:05 I’m hoping 2019 Brent crude, the global oil benchmark will average just over $69 a barrel in 2019 Crude prices have dropped by more than 30% since hitting four-year high at the start of October

8047 2018-12-25 00:44:56 I found out late on Christmas Eve that I'm cooking Christmas Dinner for 6 and there's no oil for roasting.
They'll find out at dinner time they're getting baked potatoes with a chocolate jus.
Merry Christmas you lot.

8053 2018-12-25 00:43:20 Variety is the spice of life, an artist should never only have one implement. One should choose from a pencil or water color or oil or ink. How boring art world would be if everyone used just a pencil. 
8054 2018-12-25 00:43:15 There are some really good skin/hair care products out there. I use all natural beard oil/cream as moisturizer for my skin, and hair. It works great. I have pretty sensitive skin myself, it really helps with beard itch, razor burn, and dry hair/skin. It can be a little spendy
8055 2018-12-25 00:43:09 if I may, I would highly recommend frying as an alternative. I just throw my leftovers in a pan with some oil until it's hot and it's invariably delicious
8056 2018-12-25 00:43:09 Oil prices at $42.70 . That hedge would have been awful for us. Political jabs aside , some manufacturing companies should report some great numbers in February.
8057 2018-12-25 00:43:09 We have perfect climate for good economy. More people working,oil prices go down and top of 1% weltea returning the wealth what they grab by establishment helping.
8058 2018-12-25 00:42:50 Why is the lighting on this photo like out of a classical oil painting?

8060 2018-12-25 00:42:12 With oil dropping to about $42.50/barrel today, down from about $73 earlier this year, about a 40% decrease, why is the price at the pump in Toronto, about $1.30/l. earlier this year, only about $1.03 today, about a 20% decrease, a 20% difference?

8066 2018-12-25 00:41:10 Do you understand the sacrifices taken by seafarers to keep economies ticking over, all those containers from China, the fuel oil from  the Persian Gulf, ferries bringing families home? They get on with it without complaining or whining on social media. Same job different day.

8099 2018-12-25 00:36:29 This is so true! I’m in sales and many of the oil field companies hire undocumented workers with a stolen SS number they buy.

8118 2018-12-25 00:32:30 your point was that the high number of oil & gas contributions are due to large numbers of texans working in that industry and the numbers just don't support that even with texas having more of those jobs relative to other states

8137 2018-12-25 00:29:21 法定年数でしか評価できないからいつまで経っても銀行に不動産の個別評価が出来ないんだろうに……話が逆。一番価格下落リスクが高いのは（銀行の大好きな）新築物件だろうし、西部の融資エリアであれば耐用年数切れの物件の家賃下落リスクはほとんど無いはず。

8150 2018-12-25 00:27:52 I heat up olive oil about 5mm deep in an ovenproof dish, parboil my potatos, smash them around a little, dust them with flour, salt them and pop them in the oven for half an hour, rotating them occasionally for coverage and they’re reaaaally good

8155 2018-12-25 00:27:17 Is Beto for a living wage?
For money out of politics?
No money from oil?
Regulating banks?
Reversing the tax cut?
Taxing Wall Street?
Universal health system?
Regulating rents?
Auditing the Pentagon?
Making lobbing illigal?
And good and robust climate change policy?
8156 2018-12-25 00:26:46 And @ votelau is trying to infiltrate the newly form @peoplespca party that is currently the only one against globalism/socialism.

Canada is already socialist. We have massive debt, poor economy, and a some want to add basic income. Same who hate our oil.

Major socialist push!

8158 2018-12-25 00:26:34 Do u think common people understand this math. We want reduced fuel price that’s all when crude oil is below 60$ per barrel we pay more. We don’t want math instead reduced fuel price below 40₹

8171 2018-12-25 00:23:53 I GOT OIL IN MY EYE!
8172 2018-12-25 00:23:28 Peak oil has been called several times now. There is no doubt oil is on the wane, not going to happen this decade. You won’t be seeing electric combines or tractors any Time soon. While electric vehicles work well in urban areas, rural areas @ will be using fuel for some time.
8173 2018-12-25 00:23:21 No oil was used lol. Just straight hot metal
8174 2018-12-25 00:23:05 ran out of olive oil. can i cook dinner in cbd oil
8175 2018-12-25 00:23:00 Whalers valued spermaceti because it could be cooled into a wax, made into ointments, creams, wax candles and industrial lubricants. The whale’s spermaceti organ & blubber was also used as a superior lighting oil and later as a lubricant and in soap manufacturing.
8176 2018-12-25 00:22:58 For the shift away from oil it’s inevitable. The sooner we deal with it the faster we come back up. Whatever we have been doing, no matter the government in power, has to change. Trudeau’s views and approach are different but different is what we gotta do. try. Not backwards.
8177 2018-12-25 00:22:51 Lmaoooo well I just created it the other day... I’ve been procrastinating on opening it up.  Will be adding the last 3 members eventually (oil painting is slow work heh)
8178 2018-12-25 00:22:50 @davidsirota I sniffed out Beto's voting record and got a stiffy for the $$$ Beto took from big, dripping oil. Texas Tea.
8179 2018-12-25 00:22:44 Didn't know that. Now explain best way to remove oil from pans & detergent doesn't always do the trick.

8181 2018-12-25 00:22:31 Context: the dubbed version of Dallas ran on Austrian TV when I lived there as a kid. For a young boy from Ukraine the concept of a Texan oil millionaire was ... exotic.

8186 2018-12-25 00:21:32 true, but it was a big part only because oil is very important. then ofcource it's more complicated then that. but this is twitter, we don't have 10.000 characters to print ;)

8201 2018-12-25 00:17:44 It's so easy! Just toss the cauliflower in oil with turmeric, paprika, salt, a little cumin powder. Throw in some fresh ginger, onions, and red bell pepper. Then bake at 375 degrees for 30-45 minutes until the cauliflower is soft.
8202 2018-12-25 00:17:38 Dear Santa,

All I want this Christmas is for you to...

PLEASE SHUT DOWN OIL DRILLING IN NATIONAL PARKS AND PROTECT THEM FROM THE EVIL PEOPLE!
8203 2018-12-25 00:17:33 from what i’m being told the original master house is owned privately & lived in, the rest of the land (slave quarters, abandoned sugar mill, sugarcane field) is owned by an oil company or something? so it’s separate but the fact that anybody can sleep in that house is crazy.
8204 2018-12-25 00:17:14 No that is the truth. Just do a little research on it let's start with oil refineries. There has not one been built sense Bill Clinton put so many restrictions on them and that put a strain on them to persuade enough gas like when a storm hits.

8207 2018-12-25 00:16:54 Great....mission accomplished. Time for rebuilding so Saudi can run that oil pipeline thru Syria. Great crooked hand off. It was never to help Syrians it defeat isis...for oil, money as always.

8209 2018-12-25 00:16:35 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.
8210 2018-12-25 00:16:22 Update: I got an olive oil drizzle bottle and it might be one of my favorite gifts!
8211 2018-12-25 00:16:02 Plus, the Wind turbines need oil products to actually work, with out it, they stop working, Wind just doesn’t provide that much power or it’d be everywhere by now!

8214 2018-12-25 00:15:48 The stock market is having its worst Christmas Eve ever. We are talking worse than any of the Depression years, worse than the oil embargo crisis of ’73-’74, worse than the year of the Dot-com blow-up, and more recently, worse than the turmoil year of 2008. You're doing great!
8215 2018-12-25 00:15:31 It’s being proactive instead of reactive. It’s too late once you can say we are being overrun. When you car breaks down because you never changed the oil, is that the time to change the oil? No, because it’s too late. Europe is a good example of what may happen here.
8216 2018-12-25 00:15:20 It really depends on your hair. Personally essential oils, Taliah waajid healing oyl and some other oil helps me out
8217 2018-12-25 00:15:20 Perhaps if you tell him it's a new design for oil platforms?

Yeah, good thing they don’t mention that on their donor forms or anything.
8224 2018-12-25 00:13:46 My mom is yelling at my stepdad, no one started the oil for this turkey let alone started frying it, I still have gifts to wrap AT MY HOUSE, and I'm almost out of wine.... Happy holidays

8259 2018-12-25 00:08:38 My friend confided in me that he’d had crippling anxiety and panic attacks for about a year. 
Then he tried CBD oil (cannabidiol), which he says “completely obliterated” it. “It’s gone,” he said.

I have no affiliation with any CBD oil concerns; just something to consider.

8267 2018-12-25 00:06:42 There used to be a lot more former slave cabins, visible from Hwy 90 between NOLA and BR. Oil companies bought lots of the land; some preserved them, others did not.

They are absolutely crucial to keep, history speaks thru them. 
Visit the Whitney Plantation, if you haven’t yet.
8268 2018-12-25 00:06:30 Who schedules an oil change on Christmas Eve anyways?
8269 2018-12-25 00:06:26 While I'm at it, huge kudos to the @CityofVancouver for burning the midnight oil getting this license out the door before Christmas. I know it's never easy to do something new (and this complex), and we're all grateful for the hard work.
8270 2018-12-25 00:06:21 That location could certainly be anxiety provoking. Personally I'd discuss it with his vet and go with something that has worked for other dogs that size and has been proven to be safe.
