1 2018-12-20 23:59:21 Today's Market = Christmas Blues

Where's the Santa rally? This has been one of the worst December's in the history of the market. Stocks down hard again today in continued reaction to the Fed's words yesterday. Nobody's buying, the deals are weak.

S&P 500: 2,467.42

2 2018-12-20 23:58:58 Just for clarification, ICYMI: the DOW is a marketing tool, the companies that were down x% in 1931 do not exist anymore, there were many current stocks that had been in parabolic patterns, they are correcting, what has happened before will happen again in markets...
3 2018-12-20 23:58:53 I’ve seen you mention lower discount rates (I interpret that as interest rates) being supportive of stocks a couple times recently.  I disagree.  If I’m missing something, please elaborate.
4 2018-12-20 23:57:47 BREAKING: Stocks are plunging again on Wall Street, chopping another 600 points off the Dow Jones Industrial average. Help #RESIST
5 2018-12-20 23:56:00 U.S. stocks close far lower Thursday 12/20/18 $DJIA -1.99% (-464.06) at 22,859.60, $SPX -1.58% (-39.5) at 2,467.42, $COMPQ -1.63% (-108.4) at 6,528.41.
6 2018-12-20 23:55:56 Please. So I will have 100 one day and 10 the next.  To volitile of a currency. Be like using stocks to buy a sneaker.
7 2018-12-20 23:55:39 Biggest day ever stocks drop like way more than Great Depression I never thought it would happen but at end of day your at Obama level which was a great economy. Administration has done nothing but make every one on edge
8 2018-12-20 23:55:11 Funding BS exists always. In every market. That’s what stocks are. It’s a way for companies to get funded. Some more sketchy than others.
9 2018-12-20 23:54:47 Anyone “forced” to sell stocks in a recession has no one to blame but themselves. It’s indicative of carrying too much risk.  Maintain adequate liquidity. Never conflate your savings with your investments. Being up to the hilt seems like a great idea until you’re “forced” out.
10 2018-12-20 23:54:43 You can't apply metrics to a belief system.  You can try to, but that is not how Bitcoin works.  Until you can understand this fundamental difference between stocks and crypto, you will always try to fit a square peg in a round circle.
11 2018-12-20 23:54:37 Immediatley after the mass shootings in Las Vegas, Rep Massie proposed a bill to make bump stocks legal and he posted a picture of himself holding an AK47. He's a nutcase who was only elected because he ran as a Republican and was unopposed.

38 2018-12-20 23:52:36 I can’t believe president Trump has banned bump stocks. So much for him protecting our 2nd amendment rights. I have always believed in him but now I’m not sure I can support him anymore!!! I don’t own a bump stock Or want one but the government shouldn’t ban these
39 2018-12-20 23:52:29 Lets see- 5 days before Christmas 1. Government shutdown.  2. Stocks way down 3. SecDef quits. Merry Christmas from #DonaldTrump!
40 2018-12-20 23:52:25 Gold/Silver stocks are the new safe haven on the Aussie Market - who would have thought 
41 2018-12-20 23:52:14 Check my stocks all of them are down 
42 2018-12-20 23:51:45 Trump policy supported by Dinesh has resulted in:

-Mattis quitting
-Shutdown looming
-Stocks plunging
-DOJ in turmoil

Trump and the Republicans have absolutely no idea how to govern.
43 2018-12-20 23:51:41 Obama tried to pass GUN REFORM and literally cried when it didn’t pass. Said one gun death is one too many. And bump stocks weren’t a thing. Obama was going after the bigger problem.
44 2018-12-20 23:51:17 Absolutely. These shady clowns will not be happy until the US crumbles because they want to trip up the president. They blame him for stocks dropping and bad decisions yet they are the ones who consistently sabotage and obstruct any potential progress. They are at fault
45 2018-12-20 23:50:55 U.S. stocks close far lower Thursday 12/20/18 $DJIA -1.99% at 22,859.60, $SPX -1.58% at 2,467.42, $COMPQ -1.63% at 6,528.41, $RUT -1.72% at $1326.00.
46 2018-12-20 23:49:31 Trump's got to have a threshold of how far he'll go with a shutdown & how low he'll allow the stocks to go. I think this'll end with Trump having to go back on his word about fighting for a wall on the Mexican border. The Democrats will let this Country fail before giving in.
47 2018-12-20 23:48:56 STOCKS BOOMIN
48 2018-12-20 23:48:37 We The People stand with @POTUS @realDonaldTrump 100%. @SenSchumer & @NancyPelosi lying. Stocks down due to Fed Reserve & @HouseDemocrats Shut it down President!  Stand up to these lying nauseating asswipes. We should pull out of ME. #BuildTheWall #ShutUpThugs

50 2018-12-20 23:48:24 PLEASE investigate decisions Trump is making while aligning his departure before resigning.Pulling out of Syria-promise to #Putin & will use $'s saved to pay for #wall. Comments about #shutdown impact stocks so his circle can buy low. Promised Wall contract to close friend!
51 2018-12-20 23:48:10 Mattis “retires” and the stocks plunge again the worse month in over a decade
52 2018-12-20 23:47:22 Really?  Other than the unrealized gains on stocks, how has a person in suburban Chicago had his life adversely affected?
53 2018-12-20 23:47:21 Beginning to get worried sir. You couldn't get Obamacare repealed, you can't get the wall built. Mattis resigned and you banned bump stocks and went against the 2nd amendment. To be honest sir it's not looking good for your reelection  prospects or legacy.
54 2018-12-20 23:47:04 #Chaos: Mattis Out, Government Shutdown Looming, Stocks Market Plunging and DOJ in Turmoil 
55 2018-12-20 23:46:33 In 90 days until the suit is ruled on bump stocks are banned. How fast can your legislation become law? We need this in the meantime.
56 2018-12-20 23:46:25 Hopes on 45/GOP cutting corporate taxes—and then those hopes coming to fruition—kept stocks on a sugar high.
57 2018-12-20 23:46:11 Just depends on the mu. Even weak nair sends like 180* so it ends stocks
58 2018-12-20 23:46:00 But Trump doesn't control the market. People are selling stocks because of their fears over the economy and this president. This guy is creating chaos and the market hates chaos. Chaos is bad for the country. When he shuts down the govt, people won't get paid at CHRISTMAS.
59 2018-12-20 23:45:37 Raytheon stocks down,huh, I wonder why.
60 2018-12-20 23:45:22 I have never been so sure as I am today of my strategy to never, ever, buy stocks on margin.

62 2018-12-20 23:45:11 You talk about a lower discount rate as if a) it’s investors stampeding out of stocks and b) investors reflect daily changes in Rf rate in their models.  Wrong on both counts.  And besides valuations are meaningless when the herd is this agitated.

65 2018-12-20 23:44:50 It’s congress not Trump on wall if he EO it liberal courts would stop him! I blame congress more then Trump for this shit show! Just like I blame the Fed for the stocks free falling under obama in 8yrs they raised it once under Trump 4x pulse 3 more in 19 wtf!
66 2018-12-20 23:44:40 Shutdown Looming 
Stocks are plunging
Economy has 40% chance of crashing
Trump foolishly pulling US troops out of Syria

71 2018-12-20 23:44:04 What is he doing to cause the stocks to drop?
72 2018-12-20 23:44:02 The economy is booming. Feds just raised rates and stocks dont like it but in every other aspect this is the fastest the economy has grown in decades. Unemployment is at all time lows.
73 2018-12-20 23:43:21 @realDonaldTrump Do not give in. They are blaming you for the stocks now. Show facts to the American people on how many dems voted in favor of the wall and now or turning their backs. #BuildTheWall #MAGA #WWG1WGA #QAnon . We will Win!
74 2018-12-20 23:43:19 Banning number stocks, not getting the wall built and forcing out the two most respected and believed/beloved men in your administration? This is not a good week for you, my friend.
75 2018-12-20 23:43:14 Just sold all my stocks, Government set to shut-Down by 12 Midnight on Tomorrow!
76 2018-12-20 23:42:44 Pres Trump is toying with the Stocks...He is not using His business genius.
77 2018-12-20 23:42:44 Suppose bump stocks and even guns are outlawed. Then suppose a criminal harms you or your loved ones in spite of it, with or without an illegal weapon? (Because that’s what they do.) What then have you achieved? Don't reduce my odds please. Slippery slope.
78 2018-12-20 23:42:04 Tell me why it’s extremist idea to have bump stocks legal. How many have been used in crimes? One. So what now ban knives, hammers, hands, feet, baseball bats, cars, and computers. All of those are responsible for more deaths than bump stocks. BS make you horribly inaccurate.
79 2018-12-20 23:42:01 How about computers buying and selling stocks.
80 2018-12-20 23:41:58 Stocks are dropping 500 points every day!  This president is killing America. And people are far too soft to put a end to it, they need to implement the 25th admendment!!
81 2018-12-20 23:41:54 Now that we have entered a bear market, one good thing is that stocks will reset their base counts - some of them have already done so during the correction.  Base resetting gives a stock a bit more of a runway in the event that it does break out and move higher.
82 2018-12-20 23:41:37 Wall failed

84 2018-12-20 23:41:15 You've been watching the live action "Donny T Wrecks America" for two years now. Stocks plummeting, Government shutting down, everybody bailing out of his Administration, Plant Closings, sheer governmental ignorance and more. What are you going to do?
85 2018-12-20 23:40:45 I hope you a right Mr. B. I have loaded up on propane stocks. 
86 2018-12-20 23:40:13 Chief of Staff and Secretary of Defense are out, a government shutdown (and its impact on our economy) is looming, dictators cheering, stocks plunging, danger of Great Depression... all chaos caused by Trump this week. 

Is it time yet? #25thAmendment
87 2018-12-20 23:38:59 Part of the game. Two weeks into my life as an analyst at Gartner the CEO of Apple tried to have me fired. The amplification of the internet today means you don't need to be Gartner to move stocks or have a CEO make threats.
88 2018-12-20 23:38:52 I love this new job. It's tiring. But I seem to be staying up later frittering my time away because I can't unwind to sleep. Also, eating the Christmas stocks.
89 2018-12-20 23:38:36 Agree.... unless you are comfortable shorting stocks and holding puts.
90 2018-12-20 23:38:16 I told my financial advisor to move away from US stocks around 3 months ago because of the risk associated withTrump's instability and incompetence.
91 2018-12-20 23:38:11 There as no shooting using bump stocks until Las Vegas
92 2018-12-20 23:37:44 - Syria
- Mattis out

- Stocks plunging
- DOJ in turmoil

Is this Trump’s swan song?
93 2018-12-20 23:37:36 #Mattis out, US #stocks plummet, US forces pulled from Syria, sanctions on oligarchs lifted and a government shut down. Who benefits from all this?  Hint - .
94 2018-12-20 23:37:15 Crypto is pumping

Stocks are dumping
95 2018-12-20 23:37:13 Not on the right side of the issues. Setting whole world backwards. Watch the stocks tomorrow
96 2018-12-20 23:36:38 If you try to catch the rhythm

Very soon a market schism

97 2018-12-20 23:36:32 The fed will keep pumping dollars. The interest rates will keep rising, and nothing will change. Now what will happen is these overinflated stocks will fall on their faces, and I'll be laughing all the way down as I short it from the top.

102 2018-12-20 23:35:06 #Chaos: Mattis Out, Government Shutdown Looming, Stocks Market Plunging and DOJ in Turmoil 
103 2018-12-20 23:34:47 In my barely qualified opinion, buy stocks when the yield curve is re-steepening after a downturn, and sell when it’s declining, and especially when its about to invert like it is right now
104 2018-12-20 23:34:42 they’ve equated “self worth” with currency/funds like stocks off the market...yet they aren’t for sale...

....beyond me..
105 2018-12-20 23:34:31 I’m shorting every stock I own, and going to get out of what I can without too severe tax implications. This news with Mathis, the shutdown, and the Fed, etc. Stocks will plummet tomorrow
106 2018-12-20 23:34:04 @jimcramer With stocks down so low I am considering a partial Roth conversion transferring stocks in kind.  I can transfer some stocks at current prices then when they go back up not have to worry about taxes.  ?good idea?  Love Fireside Chat.
107 2018-12-20 23:33:58 nah i dont mind if i get a misinput every now and then. but when it be costing stocks its actually bad
108 2018-12-20 23:33:58 There’s a reason why I traded otcbb/pinkies in the past and why I trade small caps today: because these stocks don’t give a darn what the general markets are doing. Scammy stocks don’t care. They have a mission to sell paper to fund their failing biz. The end game all the same
109 2018-12-20 23:33:54 I am not at all having an anxiety attack from Mattis quitting, stocks plunging, and a shutdown looming. Nooooope.
110 2018-12-20 23:33:14 $PHGI @PremierHealthGI closed at 91 up a penny on c.150k(still Arb closed it slightly red at 67US); $NTAR closed at 61 up 2 pennies on 100k+ volume. There’s always stocks that offer upside potential despite all the negativity out there. Tax loss selling ending soon!!
111 2018-12-20 23:32:43 The differences today: stocks even more ridiculously expensive, Treasuries even more expensive, active open steps to destroy any remaining shred of fed's credibility. And more. Having considered this, have a stiff drink and enjoy life. Buy gold may be
112 2018-12-20 23:32:32 LMT978, stocks bounced hard seconds after u closed your trading positions. 
113 2018-12-20 23:32:15 The more you talk the more you dont know what your talking about with crypto. How about stick to your stocks.
114 2018-12-20 23:32:05 Stocks down, Mattis is out, Shut down probable, DOJ in turmoil

117 2018-12-20 23:31:37 The wheels are coming off the White House: Mattis out, shutdown looming, stocks plunging, DOJ in turmoil. And it’s only Thursday!
118 2018-12-20 23:31:28 Oh, nice, Trump, rightly, signs this and wrongly signs the illegalization of bump stocks without it going through the proper Constitutional process of law creation.
119 2018-12-20 23:31:22 BUY STOCKS! $TSLA $TSLAQ $TLRY
120 2018-12-20 23:31:04 Well just look at stocks at the moment and the state of fiat. History has not shown that a globally linked capitalist system is sustainable for the long term. The great depression (wall st crash) was a warning of how hard it can fall. The fall could be even bigger today
121 2018-12-20 23:30:28 I think I’m going to wait 3 months before looking at my stocks again!

123 2018-12-20 23:29:46 Investors have been redeeming $URA ETF holdings in the massive downturn in US market, which resulted in Global X selling $36M worth of #uranium stocks.  When investors start buying $URA again in market rebound it will flip to opposite, with Global X buying $$M in U stocks again.
124 2018-12-20 23:28:57 45 Chaos: Mattis out, Shutdown looming, stocks plunging, DOJ  in Turmoil. America, this is not leadership! This is dereliction, fecklessness, shameful, dangerous. Do we want this country? I don’t think the powers that be, US Congress, etc., give a damn! Why don’t we do something?
125 2018-12-20 23:28:39 And rememeber these are the same companies that bought back a lot of their stock with the tax breaks.   Since the stocks have now  plummetted much of that $$ has simply disappeared out of our economy!   Great job GOP!
126 2018-12-20 23:28:24 Let’s see - Trump gets elected, stocks soar. Democrats take the House, they immediately plummet. Coincidence?  Nope.

Don’t hear crowing about the market from you lately Don’t blame the Fed, rates still low. You followed the Herbert Hoover playbook tax cuts &tariffs  isolation #voteyour401k
129 2018-12-20 23:26:55 Can someone tell me why the hell @realDonaldTrump banned bump stocks by EO? That's some BS right there and I hate Bump Stocks. There pieces of plastic that over burn. Do it through legislation not regulation
130 2018-12-20 23:26:48 Merry Christmas with the "Three Wisemen" Powell, Mnuchin and Trump bringing Interest Rates, Bonds and Stocks to a baby that's well past its infancy! @DavidBCollum @MishGEA @rcwhalen @GrantsPub @TheBubbleBubble
131 2018-12-20 23:25:36 Tyranny, as defined by George Washington, is when the government is more powerful than the people, we've far crossed that line, the banning of bump stocks doesnt affect me, but it is itself evidence that the government is stripping away our rights through the town of the majority
132 2018-12-20 23:24:37 Govt shutdown. Mattis resignation. Stocks plunging. No Justice Sec recusal. Syria debacle. What else? Trump destroys US. Though Putin may not be able to claim that his boy is doing a good job at his behest, he must be very happy w what no Soviet military force could ever do.
133 2018-12-20 23:24:36 Hi Sir, I'd like to invest 10 dollars please.
Sure what are you looking at kid, bonds, stocks, AANNNNND ITS GONE.
What?
Your money,

134 2018-12-20 23:24:31 More like continued incompetence and ineptitude.

Mattis quit, shutdown looming, stocks plunging, DOJ in turmoil. 

Art of the deal? Trump is a master of unnecessary chaos.
135 2018-12-20 23:24:23 But there are lots of people losing fiat right now sadly, retirement plans and stocks .. so wouldn't they want them replaced? Someone's gotta buy their stuff?
136 2018-12-20 23:24:18 Soon rebuying tsla stock waiting for 250$ :) and get some more stocks
137 2018-12-20 23:24:10 Major concerns for stability of the country- loss of Mattis, threats to national security, & attacks to rule of law against our democracy + shutdown looming, stocks plunging, & DOJ in turmoil. Trump + FOX propaganda has subverted actual governance= WH off the rails= total chaos!
138 2018-12-20 23:23:29 Another fabulous evening at The Stocks Inn!! 

Fabulous food and FAB-U-LOUS company!! 

Keep the snaps coming... 
139 2018-12-20 23:23:10 ....Isengard, Iron Hills and Morias- not happy! They pouts as Sméagol wanders off! Now they must lurks in darks alone! Without us! Without the Precious! But whats bout what Sarumans says? NEVER IT MIND! We stocks up many sweet fishes! If hunger comes and stomach groans we EATS!
140 2018-12-20 23:23:02 what is stocks ice cream
141 2018-12-20 23:22:39 im gonna need Trump to not shut down the govt. its killing my stocks....
142 2018-12-20 23:21:54 Make sure you turn in your bump stocks
143 2018-12-20 23:21:46 #Mattis
Ok GOP , enough, the last adult is leaving.
The Trump Administration is in chaos, stocks are in free fall,
The Government is about to shut down and our deficit exploding.
The leader of America is certifiable, 25th Amendment and remove him now.
144 2018-12-20 23:21:44 We have to pay attention 24,500yen that is very important price.
24,500yen is very strong support line since stocks prices should make big rebound.
145 2018-12-20 23:21:34 For individual stocks that is true.  For the market as a whole a fall can be an opportunity?  Looking at the S&P 500 and Apple is on a forecast P/E of 11.6X, Facebook is on 17.5X, Microsoft and Alphabet are on about 21X, Johnson & Jonson on 15X.  All strong global companies.
146 2018-12-20 23:21:23 He just gave away the play they are running. They think pivoting “Left” on issues like Syria, prison reform and bump stocks are like shiny objects and we are just magpies to be distracted. Fuck that noise.
147 2018-12-20 23:20:29 Stocks plummeting 
Syria pullout a gift to Russia
Kelly out 
SecDef Mattis out
No head of DOJ
Gov shutdown looming 

Time to call it, @GOP #25thAmendmentNow
148 2018-12-20 23:20:26 So glad I don’t have stocks. Lol my money is safe.
149 2018-12-20 23:20:03 Because stocks r down 7% ytd inequality is being reduced?
150 2018-12-20 23:19:58 I’m sorry, but why is the soft bigotry of low expectations ok with you?  Oh and had Obama banned bump stocks, every republican in Congress would be threatening impeachment.  Don’t think it’s true? You haven’t followed the gun debate much.
151 2018-12-20 23:19:28 “hi the market has been bad, can you give me your predictions?”

“hi i’m invested in stocks and have lost almost $10,000, how do i get back?”

“PUT ALL MY FUNDS IN A FIXED INCOME!”

life as a financial advisor due to trumps’ stank ass
152 2018-12-20 23:19:25 more like arnold the pig but not as smart. you caused stocks to buckle when u ratcheted up taxes on Chinese imports in hopes of forcing Beijing to strike a deal that would protect U.S. technology from theft and reduce the trade deficit with China Farmers suffered. Idiot
153 2018-12-20 23:18:55 Headline on my TV right now:  Trump chaos, Mattis out, shutdown looming, stocks plunging over 500 pts, DOJ in turmoil!!!!!!!
154 2018-12-20 23:18:22 So...in the last week I’ve seen @realDonaldTrump not shut down the government over border wall security, seek to ban bump stocks and wants to remove troops from Syria??? I feel like he’s angling for the top of the @DNC ticket for the 2020 election #bizarroworld
155 2018-12-20 23:17:54 Mattis quit, shutdown looming, stocks plunging, DOJ in turmoil. 

Art of the deal? More like master of unnecessary chaos.
156 2018-12-20 23:17:33 Why distract today given the recent news about the banning of bump stocks? 

Why is the NRA not up in arms about the ban on bump stocks enacted by Pres. Trump? 

Is your outrage selective? I'm beginning to think it is a stunt.
157 2018-12-20 23:17:26 Mattis quit, shutdown looming, stocks plunging, DOJ in turmoil. 

Art of the deal? More like master of unnecessary chaos.
158 2018-12-20 23:17:01 That pulling troops out of the Middle East, criminal justice reform and banning bump stocks are not conservative orthodoxy.
159 2018-12-20 23:16:56 .@realDonaldTrump So much winning we will be tired of it.      MATTIS OUT, SHUTDOWN LOOMING, STOCKS PLUNGING, DOJ IN TURMOIL... AND... AND... AND.....
160 2018-12-20 23:16:55 Wow. Mattis leaving with more official exits to come, US tech stocks enter the first bear market in over a decade, and a government shut down just in time for Christmas. Not a good day, or 2 years, to be @realDonaldTrump who promised the masses economic prosperity and leadership.
161 2018-12-20 23:16:50 Months ago, i started reading economists saying a Recession, like '08 but not as bad, is looming ahead if tRUmp doesn't change things. But instead, he undermines every effort to head it off. Syria. Stocks. Individuals & many Companies barely hanging on. His latest orders?Destroy!
162 2018-12-20 23:16:47 Most of the gold stocks aren't even in Stage 2 yet.  We are not even done with the first inning if this is a new breakout.
163 2018-12-20 23:16:42 "Mattis out, stocks plunging, government shut down looming, DOJ in turmoil"
This is the headline on MSNBC.
When is enough, enough, this is a very dangerous position thus asshole has left us in and I am so GD mad I am about to lose it.
This traitorous, uneducated, crook MUST GO!!!
164 2018-12-20 23:16:34 “Mattis out, shutdown looming, stocks plunging, Dept. of Justice in turmoil.” What a headline, all in one day.
165 2018-12-20 23:16:31 Definitely a gift, along with many other Uranium stocks!
166 2018-12-20 23:16:26 Trump chaos: Mattis out, shutdown looming, stocks plunging, DOJ in turmoil, Syria pull out, and moments ago news of groups of troops being pulled out of Afghanistan as early as weeks from now! This is so scary! Trump is having a serious meltdown.... #25thAmendment
167 2018-12-20 23:16:12 Bump stocks? That’s just a feel good. Will make no difference to criminals.
168 2018-12-20 23:16:10 I know everything is blowing up at the Trump administration right now and stocks are tanking and the government is close to being shut down and we’re giving Russia Syria and the president is under investigation for multiple crimes, but

Why did no one warn us he was a bad pick?
169 2018-12-20 23:15:16 @realDonaldTrump You lose you Secretary of Defense on principle -- he wants to stand with our allies and not with dictators. Stocks plunge because of you, government shut down, and your tariffs. Government shutdown over wall. A third of your cabinet empty. #NotFitForOffice
170 2018-12-20 23:14:57 Mattis out, shutdown looming, stocks plunging, DOJ in turmoil. Only thing left is for Vlad to hold a press conference announcing he is in control, here in the White House.
171 2018-12-20 23:14:52 Let's make those bubbles infinite like all stocks.
172 2018-12-20 23:14:52 your stocks dont feel so good
173 2018-12-20 23:14:52 This is unbelievable in view of everything else that is happening as a result. Stocks are beginning to crash, General Mattis announced his retirement. The orange buffoon must be removed from the White House now.
174 2018-12-20 23:14:48 Stocks dropped 4000 off their high.  Tried of winning?
175 2018-12-20 23:14:44 I suppose Parliament is full of the brown and smelly and getting worse,if so, you can bet your bottom dollar they will have first call on any stocks
176 2018-12-20 23:14:43 Shutdown, stocks plunging, Mattis out, complete turmoil. Trump is a JOKE.
177 2018-12-20 23:14:22 #GeneralMattis is out, stocks are plunging, interest rates are going up, @realDonaldTrump is shutting down the government. At what point will the @GOP wake up and stop this lunatic?
178 2018-12-20 23:14:09 Any gold stocks you follow also selling on tsx not yet extended?
179 2018-12-20 23:13:54 Every catastrophe is an opportunity if you have enough money. When property values plummet, those with means can pick up assets on the cheap. They also can afford to hold stocks etc until value returns, they aren't hurt by any of this.
180 2018-12-20 23:13:46 Ima be real. K rool is gross but not gross enough to be nerfed. He is heavy so it makes him combo food. His stomach armor breaks in like 5 hits too so you can easily cuck him of stocks in neutral.
181 2018-12-20 23:13:45 It may be past the time for impeachment. Personally, I'm investing in torch & pitchfork stocks.
182 2018-12-20 23:13:42 Trump chaos, Lumpy. Mattis out, shutdown looming, stocks plunging, DOJ in turmoil. DJT is breaking down.

186 2018-12-20 23:13:26 @POTUS @GOP @WhiteHouse I guess you morons really are tired of winning…Since midterm: the Dow Jones industrial average has lost 2,300 points, or 9%, with several slides following Trump comments. Stocks are on track for their worst December since 1931, during the Great Depression
187 2018-12-20 23:13:25 With respect, banning 'bump-stocks' makes schools safer along with making everyone safer.   Have a good day and Thank President Trump for banning the 'bump-stock'.
188 2018-12-20 23:13:10 Good job. What's your perspective on Tesla stocks by the end of 2018?
189 2018-12-20 23:12:40 @realDonaldTrump once again my stocks are falling.  They’re all negative.  You’re suppose to be the smart guy with the big brains.  What do I do?  I guess it’s vote you out!
190 2018-12-20 23:12:39 Individual stocks can rise in a bear market and fall in a bull market 
John Templeton
191 2018-12-20 23:12:12 We have had historically low rates for ten years. If they aren’t raised now we will have no tools to deal a real recession. We have three percent growth, we really low unemployment. Could it be that stocks going lower doesn’t have anything to do with interest rates? I think so
192 2018-12-20 23:11:52 how am I supposed to buy nestle stocks when its that high up can yall stop drinking milo for one fucking goddamn second???
193 2018-12-20 23:11:47 BREAKING NEWS: TRUMP CHAOS: Mattis out. Stocks plunging. Shutdown looming. DOJ in crisis.

195 2018-12-20 23:10:53 It’s the Dems spewing this narrative to the MSM. When programs regurgitate this narrative it triggers these algorithm programs to sell stocks and therefore they self perpetuate a decline in mkt value. The Dems are out to destroy our economy and gdp growth by scaring everyone.

204 2018-12-20 23:09:31 Obviously @SavinTheBees if he left twitter stocks would surely plummet
205 2018-12-20 23:09:28 The MSNBC headline tonight that encapsulates 2018: “Trump chaos: Mattis Out; Shutdown Looming; Stocks Plunging; Department of Justice in Turmoil.”  #FastenSeatBeltsFor2019
206 2018-12-20 23:09:15 ‘Efficiency’ in the govt regulated washers = our clothes are never fully clean.  Next thing you know they’ll ban bump stocks.
207 2018-12-20 23:09:12 Unreal world. I have an afternoon filled with ALS home health care team visits, then turn on the TV when it's all done & learn all the insanity that's happened this afternoon, & my head is in a whirl. #Mattis gone, #Shutdown looming, #Stocks plunging...#WhiteHouse cracking up.
208 2018-12-20 23:08:51 I don’t see how this is any different than saying to do the exact same thing but place money in weed stocks or any stocks for that matter because they will only go up in value.

215 2018-12-20 23:07:49 You are an idiot. Stocks down 4000 points and you have no comment? You are driving the country into the ground and that’s what you will be remembered for. The man baby that destroyed the USA.
216 2018-12-20 23:07:34 Lindsey is going to lose some cash on his trading of global corporate military stocks.
217 2018-12-20 23:07:34 I love my guns, and am a Trump supporter but bump stocks are stupid!!!! They should be banned!
218 2018-12-20 23:07:22 Yes, Tim, valuations do matter. That's why stocks have been going lower.
219 2018-12-20 23:07:10 EU has massive trade surplus with UK, they wouldn't say no to a trade deal in an attempt to keep CFP, access will be paid for and gradually diminished as UK's own fleet is rebuilt. Stocks will be managed by UK and the disgraceful CFP practice of throwing back dead fish will end.
220 2018-12-20 23:06:57 Definitely some of it, but a lot of “smart” old money still heads to real estate after dumping stocks because they think a fixed-rate or QM saves them, no?
221 2018-12-20 23:06:55 MSNBC currently says:
TRUMP CHAOS: MATTIS OUT, SHUTDOWN LOOMING, STOCKS PLUNGING, DOJ IN TURMOIL  (P.S.: MATTIS FIRED, HE DID NOT QUIT)
222 2018-12-20 23:06:51 Mattis, DOJ in turmoil, stocks plunging, shutdown looming. 

Another wonderful Republican president.
223 2018-12-20 23:06:41 I am not sure that Trump was the one to ban bump stocks!?? I do know that he is the one" not "to sign papers to stop the government shut down!
224 2018-12-20 23:06:35 On a positive note, I'm sure proud of my last minute decision to direct my portfolio into the untapped underground fallout shelter/gas mask stocks...

How much is enough?
236 2018-12-20 23:04:01 so Mattis is out, the govt will probably shut down, stocks are nosediving and the US is declaring Mission Accomplished in Syria? was that all today?
237 2018-12-20 23:03:44 Because Obama did his homework. Bump stocks can be built in your garage. Banning them just as a political move to appease people who don't know anything about guns but no they hate them.
238 2018-12-20 23:03:37 Trump Chaos: Mattis out, Shutdown looming, Stocks plunging, DOJ in turmoil.

246 2018-12-20 23:01:44 Hey @POTUS you have had a pretty tough month. Finishing it off by caving to #Democrats over the shutdown and border wall and signing an unconstitutional executive order banning bump stocks is a pretty ugly look. Hope you're ready to lose in embarrassing fashion in 2020

248 2018-12-20 23:01:39 @bprafulkumar does Robinhood plan on opening an affiliate program so members can shop and earn cash to invest in stocks? I really like Acorns program.
249 2018-12-20 23:01:12 As I quote, 
“King K. Rool is the big cock croc that rocks your stocks by shootin’ shots that leave ya shocked and got!”
250 2018-12-20 23:01:02 The trump administration also banned the ownership of bump stocks, which isn’t huge but still a good move in the direction for gun control.
251 2018-12-20 23:00:48 Sos un ignorante de la politica. No sabés nada. Primero, lo de los bump stocks es una medida unilateral del DOJ, ni pasó por el Congreso. Segundo, en 2013 el Congreso era controlado por los Republicanos. Obama sancionó muchas cosas mediante el DOJ tmb que están vigentes hoy día.
252 2018-12-20 23:00:46 It’s one point of view. Some of us see growth below trend, a so-called “growth recession,” a profits recession and a pronounced global slowdown. Stocks, bonds and commodities are sending an unequivocal message in that regard.

256 2018-12-20 22:59:06 Bottom line trump's tax cut can 'cut both ways'.......stocks ran up on higher corporate profits..........now the markets are Much more concerned with the prospects of higher interest and inflation rates.......And Nothing kills a stock market like the prospect of higher int. rates
257 2018-12-20 22:58:43 The anti-U.S. media- who, for the 697th consecutive day, are slamming Trump about 'something'- going after the Commander in Chief for 'crashing stocks'- instead of, their unprecedented 'ire'-filled Obama-darling Fed. Chief, Powell,  Is it FRAMEM-N-BLAMEM again- like, WITCH HUNT?
258 2018-12-20 22:58:16 Funny how CNBC tries so hard to SELL you on certain stocks
259 2018-12-20 22:58:14 Bump stocks ought to be illegal. Do that by passing a LAW and signing it, not via an unconstitutional and Orwellian executive diktat. The proper answer to that is mass defiance and litigation all the way up to SCOTUS. This isn't Tsarist Russia. #BumpStockBan
260 2018-12-20 22:57:55 Apparently there’s a “bull market” a “bear market” and a “@realDonaldTrump market.”  The losses have been pretty impressive lately.  #StockMarket #stocks
261 2018-12-20 22:57:55 Their stocks are dropping as we speak
262 2018-12-20 22:57:47 Let’s forget the majority of Bezo’s wealth is in stocks that keep Amazon afloat and would crumble to death faster than a socialist economy should he turn it into liquid assets
263 2018-12-20 22:56:09 dapit 10am lakaw nami basin daghan stocks hahaha
264 2018-12-20 22:55:02 NON

265 2018-12-20 22:54:52 @AndrewScheer @MaximeBernier:
#Norway owns about 67% of its oil. Will you consider the Norwegian model for #Canada. That of course above the royalties provincial governments receive. Canada could start by small share and build up through purchase of stocks. Canadians owns the oil
266 2018-12-20 22:53:42 Bump stocks are now illegal. Soooooo, you cant use "an almost automatic rifle"... wheres your argument?
267 2018-12-20 22:53:35 Which stocks are you invested in?
268 2018-12-20 22:53:21 Dale Sr and Dick Trickle in street stocks at five flags....
269 2018-12-20 22:53:16 Banning bump stocks = Confiscatory gun control!
270 2018-12-20 22:53:14 Wanted to take a moment to share our latest thoughts on recent market volatility. Expensive growth stocks lead the market in 2018's first 9 months.  Today the S&P is down over 15% in Q4, falling into negative territory on the year.  Why have the equity markets sold off? (1/2)
271 2018-12-20 22:52:44 I’m feeling the itch to buy a car. But I will force myself to wait until June too many good stocks to buy right now
272 2018-12-20 22:52:30 Don’t worry, Obama’s coat tails have run out. Stocks are down, jobs will follow, housing will pop and he won’t be able to get a damn thing done with a Democratic house.
273 2018-12-20 22:52:12 If you have any investments, please keep an eye on them. The stocks are dropping. Quite rapidly at that. Make sure your Financial Advisor is on top of it if you’re not! #Finance #Growth #GetIt
274 2018-12-20 22:51:58 All my stocks are hitting 52 week lows... Merry Christmas I guess? 
#ShouldofShorted
275 2018-12-20 22:51:49 Yeah.. well get on FOX and stop the War Mongers.. there are so many on FOX.. they must have big stocks in the War Machine. and gettin Paid.... and the American people see it!  So let them Know. We Know.
276 2018-12-20 22:51:39 The defined contribution plan was just another step in complete corporate hegemony by fooling you into thinking that your financial interests are identical with the guys who own 85% of all stocks.
277 2018-12-20 22:51:35 i think these stocks will still be able to be bought in certain areas though. I mean..as long as i buy the tax stamp and am legal i can get alot of the things that are considered extras. I have never needed the nra for anything about buying my fire arms to be honest.
278 2018-12-20 22:51:33 Big deal, you can make your own bump stocks and some evil jerk will. It's obvious you aren't interested in solving the problem of mass shootings, you're just interested in taking our right away to defend ourselves.
279 2018-12-20 22:51:23 US stocks have slid, with the Nasdaq on the cusp of confirming bear market territory. European shares fell, with markets in Germany, Britain & France all hitting their lowest since Dec 2016.  Ahead of the local open SPI futures are flat at 5,430. #ausshares #stockmarket
280 2018-12-20 22:51:23 I got matched against one with the name Unga Bunga on uh Skyworld? The pit stage. 
I was getting smacked but they got lylat’d all 3 stocks and dipped.
281 2018-12-20 22:50:34 If you ban pistol grips they can move to stocks to semi auto to mag caps... e.t.c you ban bump stocks it dies at bump stocks
282 2018-12-20 22:50:32 Hey at leased he pushed through the conservative policies of increasing the deficit and banning bump stocks.
283 2018-12-20 22:50:29 For the record, this Wall Street rout began right after I switched my 401K to 65% stocks instead of 90% bonds. Sorry.
284 2018-12-20 22:50:07 Well, that’s that. Closed out of all remaining individual stocks today. Only positions left are $TLT, $INDA, $SLV, and a long term $SPY long that I added some to today.
285 2018-12-20 22:49:37 Stocks wont change a government shutdown
286 2018-12-20 22:49:07 The markets are crashing because the Dems took the House. Notice markets soared when Trump elected. Two years of HATE in DC. That is why pot stocks will SOAR.
287 2018-12-20 22:48:53 This is about the Bill. Not bump stocks. No one cares about bump stocks and they know it. The actual bill is about Far more. *anything* that increases rate of fire but does not make a gun a machine gun. Look into it 
288 2018-12-20 22:48:33 No bump stocks. Some prison reform. Withdrawing from everywhere. 
A vote for Trump is a vote for anarchy!
289 2018-12-20 22:48:31 So...

Might have to cave on the wall
Exit Syria
Ban on bump stocks
Mattis out

BAD week.

Did Trump piss off a gypsy somewhere?
290 2018-12-20 22:48:16 Consistency, most of Chicago's guns come from out of state
Don't just do a background check on 1 individual, you have to look who they associate with. Police investigations happen here that help a lot.
Bump stocks obviously just got turned over so that was a good step
291 2018-12-20 22:48:09 F stocks and Wall Street. And Corps. The people are rising. GOP and NRA and corps will be gone within a generation. (I’m 54 wf, and I still have faith the next below us will cut this crap out)
292 2018-12-20 22:48:04 The Fed hiked rates again -the fourth time in 2018. Some thought a rate hike was not likely - and stocks are down as a result, 4% for the year so far.  Are we beginning the 'next' recession?  If so @SpaceCityCU is strong and ready - we will weather any storm together.
293 2018-12-20 22:48:00 Banning bump stocks, withdrawing troops, championing prison reform, approving a bailout for the farming industry... if it weren’t for him being a con man, that his trade war made the bailout necessary, his wall obsession, his tweets tanking the stock market... yeah nevermind.
294 2018-12-20 22:47:55 What a weird thing to post when YOU AND THE REPUBLICANS ARE SHUTTING DOWN THE GOVERNMENT! STOCKS ARE FALLING AND YOU HAVE ENDANGERED AMERICANS! MORON OF THE YEAR AWARD!!!
295 2018-12-20 22:47:46 I'm not a huge fan of #trump but he just banned bump stocks which if nothing else, is something towards gun control and still is getting no love from any of the Democratic party.
296 2018-12-20 22:47:39 Wow we might be at the throw a dart at the wall of stocks stage to pick a winner. Short term that is.
297 2018-12-20 22:47:31 Brooo, “financially woke” people have to be some of the most annoying people. I don’t care about your stocks or about how much money you have.
298 2018-12-20 22:47:23 Ketchup stocks perilously low, stocking up for the new year 
299 2018-12-20 22:47:19 Unemployment at the lowest in decades, more jobs, stocks have broken record after record, no major war, putting America first, made S and N Korea allies, first president to keep all campaign promises. Just saying
300 2018-12-20 22:47:17 As the @smarter_money study found, millennials think stocks are risky because the my don’t understand how they work. ‘Saving’ and not interesting is a terrible mistake. Financial education is key.
301 2018-12-20 22:47:02 Anti-smokers control tobacco companies by owning their stocks. That's why they surrendered in the Minnesota tobacco lawsuit. The only ethical issues here are about financial gain from insider information.
302 2018-12-20 22:46:53 Lol you still have stocks
303 2018-12-20 22:46:40 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to improve your carpal tunnel syndrome
304 2018-12-20 22:46:13 Yesterday - Industry: #SOFTWARE & SERVICES was 17% Positive, with #BANKS -10% Negative. Stocks: $AEE was 21% Positive, with $CAD -6% Negative. #ASX
305 2018-12-20 22:45:20 I get this. I put 3 kids 529 accounts into an 80 bond/20 stocks, back in August 2017. It hurt for a while, but steady for 2 months feels good. Kids 13,11,11.
306 2018-12-20 22:45:15 Having stocks myself it sucks, but I’ve planned on this downfall and plan to actually gain from it
307 2018-12-20 22:45:15 Yesterday's top 10's: $SPX, $PLS, $FDX, $FIJ, $PAB, $AVZ, $KDR, $BTC, $GXY, $ORE, and #ELLIOTTWAVE, #AUSBIZ, #ASX, #TRADING, #GOLD, #LITHIUM, #STOCKS, #TNRGOLD, #FOREX, #AUSPOL
308 2018-12-20 22:45:12 November and Dec has been horrible for stocks. If the Fed continues to raise interest rates and the Dems spend all their time on investigating @realDonaldTrump plan to see this as a trend.
309 2018-12-20 22:45:02 People complaining about the stock market... I see it as stocks on sale
310 2018-12-20 22:44:55 A lot of crazy things happening this week. But I’m grateful for:
1. Banning of bump stocks
2. Passage of First Step Act
3. Passage of law criminalizing lynching

They all feel late in coming but I’m glad they’re here. May the Lord allow more progress.
311 2018-12-20 22:44:28 I bet they won’t.  Most NRA members know that fully automatic firearms are the real “assult weapons”....not semi-auto rifles. Bump stocks jelp people violate the adequate law on the books. I’m NRA...I’m fine eith bump stocks; but any try at AR-15s is a big NO!!!
312 2018-12-20 22:44:08 $Wve down 20% today.   Suntrust:" Fifteen Stocks For 2019:  $UNH, $MRK, $LLY, $CI, $IQV, $VEEV, $EXEL, $RARE, $ENSG, $CRSP, $WVE, $EDIT, $MRTX,  $VKTX, and $CBAY."
313 2018-12-20 22:44:07 Listen up mister ..  while you still have support here, it’s thinning. The bump stocks? And your differences with some of the most decorated military leaders among others in the WH. If the wall goes away..   wel0, I’ll leave it there
314 2018-12-20 22:43:39 I’m kidding in the sense that the stock market collapse will cause $BTC to moon and outdo equities in mcap, however im way more bullish on $crypto than stocks in the long term
315 2018-12-20 22:43:37 The only time I am the smartest person in the room is when I'm with myself. When my financial guy suggested a month ago that "stocks were just discounted by 3%" I for once was the smartest person in the room. The market is cyclical and we are over due.
316 2018-12-20 22:43:23 Oh a gambling man  Be patient stocks will go back up they always do ...maybe you’ll have a merry Christmas a Xmas miracle 
317 2018-12-20 22:42:17 TRUMP DISTRACTION 101
Tuesday - Bump Stocks
Yesterday - Syria Withdrawal
Today - Shut down the Government, tank the DOW, Trump hoedown video and General Mattis “retiring”!
Tomorrow - Afghan Withdrawal
Saturday - Announcement that Kim Jong Un is coming for Christmas...?
318 2018-12-20 22:42:09 Stocks began dropping when talk started that DEMS would win the house.  Been down ever since. DEMS could f--- up a wet dream.
319 2018-12-20 22:41:31 Hug your stocks and retirement plans closely.. it's going to continue to be a rough ride..
320 2018-12-20 22:41:19 Being as bump stocks are an accessory and NOT a firearm.. “Shall Not Be Infringed” was maintained...
321 2018-12-20 22:40:41 The stock market will not bottom out until we hit the 2016 lows, at the very least. From there, the next level of support is fugly. #stocks #equities #Dow #tech
322 2018-12-20 22:40:35 No one I know even mentioned bump stocks. Who are these people?
323 2018-12-20 22:40:20 How right you are. They found 12 bumps stocks on 12 assault riffles. Proof is such a silly word.
324 2018-12-20 22:40:09 Stocks collapsing. Mueller and other prosecutors closing in. Wall funding mirage evaporating. Democrats taking control of the House.... So now's a good time for a well-respected Sec of Defense to leave? Desperately trying to change the subject but reinforcing storyline of chaos.
325 2018-12-20 22:39:53 Isn’t divest when you pull out of stocks
326 2018-12-20 22:39:53 Stocks looking  today
327 2018-12-20 22:39:45 @JTSEO9 can you unblock @riddlejT4  he is quite sorry for being a bit too bullish on your FASP stocks and would like another chance
328 2018-12-20 22:39:37 @petenajarian The markets are crashing because the Dems took the House. Two years of HATE in DC. Everything Trump got for US will disappear. That is why pot stocks will SOAR.
329 2018-12-20 22:39:33 Getting rid of dogs and failure stocks is liberating....
330 2018-12-20 22:39:33 the 10% of the population that supposedly owns 85% of stocks (I disregard this stat btw) are also disproportionately large consumers...market drops = negative wealth effect= lower spending which affects all.  People always try to blame the wealthy for societal ills.
331 2018-12-20 22:39:28 #Stocks,#Indexes NDX bottom signal at the close, but not SPX, which is not promising. Some rallying, particularly by NDX, is expected, but not a sustained rally. (Not charting; just FYI.)
332 2018-12-20 22:39:24 Even beer from California is not cutting edge anymore. That’s it. Sell your stocks.
333 2018-12-20 22:39:03 Mattis out at end of Feb.    Stocks fall again
dirty don refusing to sign the CR  without funding for the wall     Just another day in the tRump shitshow.

339 2018-12-20 22:37:06 Hmmm makes you wonder what will happen and what trump stocks will go up.  Stay tuned!
340 2018-12-20 22:36:58 They're really going to go apoplectic when they see what happens to industrial war-machine stocks in the near future.
341 2018-12-20 22:36:45 Apple should be setting the example for developers. If News and Stocks had been well-made apps, optimized for macOS, maybe I wouldn't be so convinced that Marzipan is bad. But Apple has not just made the development process easier — it's lowered its own design standards.

347 2018-12-20 22:35:16 Wrong obama rode W's coat tails as far as stocks at a cost of 4.5 trillion dollars not counted within the national debt held by fed reserve as they for 5 of the last 6 years of O's years in office propped up stock market buying up bad stock to keep market steady.
348 2018-12-20 22:35:07 May the stocks get as high as the consumers 
349 2018-12-20 22:34:49 Do Trump or his cronies have steel stocks?
350 2018-12-20 22:34:43 You should at least own stocks by now. 
351 2018-12-20 22:34:24 Imagine what all the war machine stocks are going to look like in the near future.
352 2018-12-20 22:34:17 Except the NRA has Ben saying since the Los Vegas shooting that they are fine with banning bump stocks. So I really don’t think they care.
353 2018-12-20 22:34:06 Large cap growth stocks are largely dominated by the leaders in #AI #Data #MachineLearning #CloudComputing #Automation such as $GOOG $AMZN $BABA $SQ $TWTR

A temporary bear market in #stocks doesn’t change fact that these companies hold strong network effects in #tech of #future.
354 2018-12-20 22:34:06 See the problem is this, no one likes or uses bump stocks much at all they are not accurate at all. Most of the shootings in this country there was no bump stock involvement. What the socialist commies and Dems want is to use this ban to springboard more acceptance for gun bans.
355 2018-12-20 22:33:46 Trump has banned bump stocks, setup for troops to come home, and passed prison reform. He wanna a few good deeds done before prison. Still feels like the twilight zone because I think those are actually good deeds

361 2018-12-20 22:33:37 #StockMarket is correcting further down. 

#uranium stocks will be at an even bigger discount. Fundamentals are getting stronger and stronger. Many new reactor builds in the next 5-10 years will drive demand. Accumulating quality mining stocks now. No financial advice.
362 2018-12-20 22:32:42 Dunno what any of this means but I bought stocks today!
363 2018-12-20 22:32:26 @jimcramer- The markets are crashing because the Dems took the House. Two years of HATE in DC. That is why pot stocks will SOAR.
364 2018-12-20 22:31:51 I thought about it. Imo he doesn't have enough at later % and doesnt take stocks as easily as others in that tier or have the range/speed not to. That recovery too
365 2018-12-20 22:31:40 Of course, but what I am trying to say is that only in hindsigjt you know for sure what was the right thing to do here if you still own stocks
366 2018-12-20 22:31:33 The markets are crashing because the Dems took the House. Two years of HATE in DC. That is why pot stocks will SOAR.
367 2018-12-20 22:31:33 Me: Be more positive!
Congress: ban automatic weapons and bump stocks (to start) 
368 2018-12-20 22:31:16 Thanks @realDonaldTrump!  Because you are a #FuckingMoron and have ZERO idea what the hell you’re doing, the DOW is already down 8% and the Nasdeq down 6% JUST this month. That’s 14% when you own stocks in both.
369 2018-12-20 22:31:06 Googles anti-drone company stocks... #GatwickDrones
370 2018-12-20 22:31:05 Totally agree. We better watch the slippery slope. Anyone that knows about guns knows banning bump stocks are like banning “sporks” because of obesity. Looks good on paper but saves NO purpose. Are binary triggers next? They essentially do the same thing. #GunControlHoax
371 2018-12-20 22:30:54 I’m thinking we will know the blow off is here when stocks like INTC and MSFT throw in the towel.  @CNBCFastMoney @petenajarian

374 2018-12-20 22:30:26 Good. I hope William Kristol and all the other RINOs lose their shirts on their defense stocks.

378 2018-12-20 22:29:11 The Stock Market is up massively since the Election, but is now taking a little pause - people want to see what happens with the Midterms. If you want your Stocks to go down, I strongly suggest voting Democrat. They like the Venezuela financial model, High Taxes & Open Borde…
379 2018-12-20 22:28:20 Standing in a very long receiving line at a wake and hearing people talking about selling stocks and buying bonds
380 2018-12-20 22:28:19 Wall 
Prison Reform 
Obamacare Repeal 
Gun Control/Bump Stocks 
381 2018-12-20 22:28:05 Stupid Fed increasing rates, killing stocks and sending us closer to a recession
382 2018-12-20 22:27:55 Mr.president I beg you to stop your assault on the Second Amendment. Banning bump stocks or any other limitation to the right of the people to keep and bare arms is unconstitutional and will not help to stop crime in any way. I voted for you once, I may not do it again.
383 2018-12-20 22:27:39 Unless my eyes are deceiving small cap stocks $IWM are now lower than they were in January 2017, wiping out the whole Trump and Tax rally.
384 2018-12-20 22:27:38 @allopneus_FR @SAV_Allopneus 4 pneus en stocks enfin montés après 48 j d’attente et gestion désastreuse de votre part car aucune reponse par mail tel ou autres.  Dites merci a votre monteur à domicile qui a sauvé la situation. Vous pouvez maintenant fermer mon compte client. 
385 2018-12-20 22:26:33 Dude, the only bubbles in the past 10 years have been in gold and crypto, driven in large part by by ppl afraid of imaginary bubbles in stocks. Not every bear market is a bubble.
386 2018-12-20 22:25:29 I think he knows this on CJR, Syria, bump stocks. The problem is he really cares about this wall stuff.
387 2018-12-20 22:25:28 Because with war Gram and others lose billions on stocks they make money on a war.
388 2018-12-20 22:25:19 When earnings high but prices low, you get low PE multiples. Period of low PE will follow by period of high PE. i.e. when you buy stocks for cheap, it'll soon enough get ermm… reasonable and beyond. 

That is, buy low as the high will come (just make sure you know what low is).
389 2018-12-20 22:25:18 Hiking rates into a deflationary slowdown is questionable logic, regardless of who owns stocks
390 2018-12-20 22:25:17 I can agree that the volatility of stocks is really dumb. Especially when one person, be it Trump, Elon Musk, etc. can make one dumb tweet and change the value of their company, (or numerous in Trump's case) up or down, by thousands of dollars
391 2018-12-20 22:25:13 Is it just me. Or is trading just got a whole lot fun? I cannot wait for tomorrow. Not necessarily because money is being made, but at least it gets us of on our feet rather than the low vol period we’ve had for some time now. #stocks #investing #trading
392 2018-12-20 22:24:39 I have these sweet pug socks, some beer socks, and Monopoly - oh you said STOCKS.

Yeah. None of those.
393 2018-12-20 22:24:20 *stocks go down 2%*
394 2018-12-20 22:23:57 I think we should ALL sue Trump for the pain and suffering he has caused all of us! If I was into stocks I'd sue him for losses on that as well.
395 2018-12-20 22:23:49 The top 10% are also the same people who won't be forced to sell their stocks in a recession though
396 2018-12-20 22:23:40 What the fuck is up with @Starbucks stocks?! 
397 2018-12-20 22:23:32 Ban bump stocks. Give everyone a semi automatic gun. Only those with the fastest fingers survive. We become a nation of speed metal guitarists.
398 2018-12-20 22:23:11 the same happens with paid discord channels for discussing stocks
399 2018-12-20 22:23:05 this price action on $BTC has me dead af tbh this is why I prefer trading stocks now shits kinda unreal sometimes but its the way of the game I suppose
400 2018-12-20 22:23:02 I just don’t believe your intentions are to only ban bump stocks. You may just be doing the bidding of people with serious wealth in Europe that seek to nibble away at our rights.  Bump stocks? Really? This is right out of the “Silent weapons for quiet wars paper.” Look it up.
401 2018-12-20 22:22:21 Awwwww...deprived of property. Thats so sad. What about the people that were deprived of life due to weapons having bump stocks on them in Las Vegas at the concert? Bump stocks are not covered under the constitution I'm sure.
402 2018-12-20 22:21:41 There is no need for bump stocks.  I’m against anyone infringing on my 2nd amendment rights but on these bump stocks I’m against them.
403 2018-12-20 22:21:25 Anya what type of scanner are you using to scan the stocks?
404 2018-12-20 22:20:58 Is this the $BTC #stockmarket flippening. Is Satoshi’s creation going to save us from impending economic doom?  Consider this... #Bitcoin is exploding over 33% in a week while we are having the worst December in stocks since the Great Depression in 1931.
405 2018-12-20 22:20:57 sorry, Lindsey. But you are going to need to diversify your portfolio.  Defense stocks won't perform as well, the Bank of the Forever War is closed.
406 2018-12-20 22:20:46 You have not put America first with your trade war. Look at how many stocks have hit a 52 week low. In 6 months you have wiped out 2 years worth of gains. And you want 5 billion without comprehensive immigration reform.
407 2018-12-20 22:20:43 Another brutal day on the market. My 2 best performing #stocks today were $ATVI & $XPO
408 2018-12-20 22:19:57 Rising interests rates are a major barrier to growth. Money that could be spent growing instead goes to the banks in the form of higher payments. Buy financial stocks!
409 2018-12-20 22:19:39 Also, there is a lot of things that are used everyday that are not legislated. No one said bump stocks are mandatory. The reclassification in of itself is also possible illegal. The ATF is not a legislative body and have no authority to create legislation. This is what happened.
410 2018-12-20 22:19:36 Stocks plunge again as slowdown fears worsen; Dow down 10 percent for December   ORLANDO SENTINEL - 519PM
411 2018-12-20 22:19:25 Mais elle a le droit d'être heureuse non ? Sa marque de makeup étais en épuisement de stocks a peine en 12 h .
412 2018-12-20 22:18:45 K Rool player just SD'd twice to even the matchup because I somehow screwed up my recovery two stocks in a row. You're alright, man. (even though I ended up SDing a third time and he didn't even give me a rematch)
413 2018-12-20 22:18:08 Can we expect any bounce at all in the telecom stocks?  I am trying to open some positions for June/July options.  Also, did you guys get any update on the Windstream case?
414 2018-12-20 22:18:05 What is your point? Some J-hole just this morning said the border was tight! Quit fucking around and resign before my lousy little stocks are defunct.
415 2018-12-20 22:18:03 Evening Market Wrap-up: stocks close sharply lower extending declines amid rising interest rates, looming US government shutdown and upcoming holiday period with reduced hours and trading.
416 2018-12-20 22:16:06 i wisely spent the day off twitter and come back to see journalists talking about "your stocks" and "your retirement funds" which is somehow the most alienating thing i've seen on this website in a couple years
417 2018-12-20 22:15:44 As if he really cares about “our youth”. He’s just using those words to pump up his base because he knows his fat ass is going down fast. Stocks are dropping, government is shutting down, indictments flying left and right. He needs to be gone.
418 2018-12-20 22:15:40 #STOCKS CRASHED. #DOW DOWN to 22859  #NASDAQ to 6528 at Close. I'm crushed 6 Figures from 6/14 highs. IN A #DEPRESSION ?
419 2018-12-20 22:15:17 Are you dense?? Gun owners of America & others are filing suit because...

..DOJ could not explain why their logic for banning bump stocks couldn't apply to any semi-automatic firearm that could successfully be bump fired even without a stock (which is pretty much all of them).
420 2018-12-20 22:15:07 It's true that stocks are getting cheaper relative to expected 2019 earnings. But 2 things to remember:
--Earnings estimates could be too high
--In a bear mkt price-to-earnings ratios always go lower than you'd think. The swinging pendulum always swings too far in both directions
421 2018-12-20 22:14:36 I am very much disappointed in President Trump.
Signing an executive order to ban bump stocks: bad.
Pulling out of Syria: bad.
Faltering time after time on the border wall: bad.
422 2018-12-20 22:13:28 Lol.  Trump just took you bump stocks.
423 2018-12-20 22:13:26 Could not disagree more, obsession with the balance sheet is something I was happy to see go when the Fed announced autopilot rolloffs and I'm deeply annoyed/disappointed in people sprinting back to it with stocks in a drawdown.
424 2018-12-20 22:12:47 Wait news says Rs want wall more than care about Syria or stocks
425 2018-12-20 22:12:46 I agree with the decision to pull the troops. I worry about the fact that the Pentagon was not in the loop and what Trump’s motivation was. I also agree with his decision to ban bump stocks. Some of us can separate issues, you know.
426 2018-12-20 22:12:34 @realDonaldTrump What's going on with Wall Street? My stocks are tanking!!
427 2018-12-20 22:12:05 It’s the anticipation of a dire future. Stocks are always a reflection of future profits.
428 2018-12-20 22:11:46 Wonder if bump stocks are illegal south of the border?
429 2018-12-20 22:11:30 LOL. Done. I'm just glad I sold my stocks in October! Much larger position.
430 2018-12-20 22:11:19 Interesting to see Chinese stocks showing relative strength lately.
431 2018-12-20 22:11:00 If you can’t sell your house, rent it.  If you have cash or investments, buy TBs, bonds or preferred stocks(not a great return but stable)
432 2018-12-20 22:10:59 Clay Trader isn't making a lot of friends today 95% of the stocks he did videos on yesterday crashed!!!
433 2018-12-20 22:10:50 Reallocating my @RobinhoodApp portfolio to all weed stocks was a good idea $CGC $TLRY $CRON $ACB
434 2018-12-20 22:10:33 Market Close: MBS -16bps; DOW -464.06; NASDAQ -108.42; S&P 500 -39.54; 10yr Treasury 2.81%; Stocks tanked today on the views of Fed being overly aggressive on rate hikes, with 2 more insight for 2019, along with their Quantitative Tightening, & Gov't Shutdown add to sentiment.
435 2018-12-20 22:10:17 In layman's terms, interest rates are rising, stocks are declining, and investors tend to flee to safer fixed-income instruments (in this case, long-term treasury bonds) in that environment.
436 2018-12-20 22:10:04 It's been fun watching all the defense industry stocks hit their 52 week lows this week 
437 2018-12-20 22:10:01 @realDonaldTrump if it was unconstitutional for Obama to outlaw bump stocks, why would you? The constitution hasn’t changed.
438 2018-12-20 22:09:59 Yellow press: Buffet bought banks' stocks because of FED?
439 2018-12-20 22:09:51 Remember that time I outplayed you for 3 minutes but with 2 mistakes I lost 2 stocks in 30 seconds 
440 2018-12-20 22:09:39 If you want to stop the likesvofvthe NRA interfering with our politics, you'll have to do more then ban bump stocks. Suggest we change how much money a candidate can spend for TV, radio, internet, etc. England's limit is $276,000 and they only can campaign for 6 weeks.
441 2018-12-20 22:09:33 Might I humbly suggest putting them in stocks in the departures zone right after check-in, so everyone can give them a good swift dickpunch en route to security
442 2018-12-20 22:08:55 I don't think they care about bump stocks--it's like a minor irritant to them. Plus you can still make semi-auto rifles automatic pretty easily.
443 2018-12-20 22:08:33 $SQ Friday will be huge selloff again no one wants stocks anymore
444 2018-12-20 22:08:28 Stocks fall on interest rate hike - isn't is funny the rate hikes occur with all Presidents, but more hikes when the President is a Republican!
445 2018-12-20 22:08:20 US stocks on track for worst year since 2008.  Debt at an all time high.  USA about to go the same way as tRump University and Casino... so much failing.
446 2018-12-20 22:07:28 Right!? I'm sure the economy would rather me put my $700 per month toward, I dunno, a home, a car, stocks (maybe not now) and bonds, or even goods/commodities made by the good ole US of A.
447 2018-12-20 22:06:49 What else is everyone going to do with their money besides put it into stocks in 2019? Go to cash and let Jamie Dimon steal 3%? Stocks will rebound unless the FED hikes so much bonds are appealing yieldwise or over leveraged banks start blowing. I don’t see either happening yet.
448 2018-12-20 22:06:21 People selling stocks fears of shutdown. Good if you are buying. Bad for not taking advantage of buying @realDonaldTrump will bail out the fed government AGAIN
449 2018-12-20 22:06:14 Haha, my Great Grandfather bought stocks in Provigo and said “Everyone has to eat!”
450 2018-12-20 22:06:11 My parents never got into stocks. They have done ok. I on the other hand started investing in 2012 and now going through my first real correction.
451 2018-12-20 22:06:06 you for bump stocks?
452 2018-12-20 22:05:55 I have been following Jim and reading his books since b4 2008 crisis. In fact his advice helped me pick bull stocks with my severance money when I lost my Goldman Sachs related job in 2008. I am a farmer now and people around me have no more disposable cash now than then - fact.
453 2018-12-20 22:05:49 True remember that time I took 2 of your stocks in 30 seconds but still lost RIP
454 2018-12-20 22:05:38 we should by Jan take out trump rally-fed should get massively dovish and stocks should rebound/ bwave up however gold/miners will outperform and then somewhat down the road the massive debt crash will start c wave down to spx 500
455 2018-12-20 22:05:37 TRUMP And THE GOP HAVE CONTROL OF ALL BRANCHES IF GOVERNMENT - THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES TOO BLAME - STOCKS PLUMMET
456 2018-12-20 22:05:29 Greg Jensen says cash will continue to be 'viable alternative' to u.s. stocks, bonds in 2019  @Reuters @ReutersBiz
457 2018-12-20 22:04:53 Hey Im retired with no pension and a lot of stocks. I'm placing part of blame on Fed,partly on the Donald for his stupidity on tariffs & partly on natural course. Perhaps Donald will hire me as a doorman like Rocker John
458 2018-12-20 22:04:09 @sethmeyers just made up a great potential @WWE character on @LateNightSeth the #CFO, he would walk in to the ring shouting ''it's business'' and his special move would be 'stocks and shares', man I can see it now, pin stripe suit, cigar, slick backed hair #classic miss the 80's.
459 2018-12-20 22:03:56 The Boeing Company (BA) price at close, 2018-12-20, is 311.35. #boeing #stocks #NYSE #space
460 2018-12-20 22:03:35 Meh. It’s just the wealthy crashing the market so they can buy back their stocks a cheap price. It’ll bounce up after they’ve hoarded a few more trillion dollars
461 2018-12-20 22:03:25 Jack keeps fixing what's not broken and things are getting screwy, no wonder stocks continue to fall
462 2018-12-20 22:03:24 odds on anti-drone company stocks rising?
463 2018-12-20 22:03:18 I know is a marathon but im tired of losses
464 2018-12-20 22:03:09 Bear market indicates that investors don't have confidence and want to get their money or want to put them in something not as volatile as stocks. A bull market indicates that the investors feel things are going up.
465 2018-12-20 22:03:01 Trying to minimize my loses and and buy we they reach thier peak low's. A few of my stocks I did that and they still dropping.
466 2018-12-20 22:03:01 I say every morning at morning strategy what good pills traders are taking to buy stocks into supply in a bear mkt .  Lol
467 2018-12-20 22:02:59 So my #stocks are getting pummeled like Rocky, but now my #bitcoin #cryptocurrency are going to the upside. So I suppose it works out  .

468 2018-12-20 22:02:52 No one is mad abt bump stocks. We’re mad about bs “red flag” laws and unlawfully infringing on constitutional rights that stuff like banning bump stocks are rolled into. If they change one thing they will change others.
469 2018-12-20 22:02:49 October 29th  they said the same thing; we know how it went: U.S. Stocks to Face $21 Billion Pension Buying, Wells Fargo Says
470 2018-12-20 22:02:45 My Evil Twin is wondering if Putin has stocks in the drone industry.....
471 2018-12-20 22:02:30 In three days Trump secured passage of a criminal justice reform bill, banned bump stocks, ended our military engagement in Syria and is now considering a drawdown in Afghanistan. Can you imagine the liberal media’s reaction if Obama did this?!
472 2018-12-20 22:02:27 U have2 move it. I put all in a stable value . 2.8% beats -127%. Only new $ going into stocks but once my last pay of the yr it's all b moved.

473 2018-12-20 22:02:06 Every time I work with my boss, he tells me I need to invest in marijuana stocks 
474 2018-12-20 22:02:03 Pot maybe stocks highly doubt in ... on recession everything takes a nose dive Canadian banks lost like 40% last time lol
475 2018-12-20 22:01:33 Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) price at close, 2018-12-20, is 315.38. #teslamotors #tesla #stocks #NASDAQ #elonmusk
476 2018-12-20 22:01:19 The stocks are bad, I have been to three supermarkets looking for pork stock cubes, cannot find any no matter how many bitcoin I flash at the staff
477 2018-12-20 22:01:17 @SecretaryRoss shame on you Wilbur Ross, making money off of Stocks twice,  after you said you sold them. Why does no one in this administration has any ethics at all.  You should resign immediately!
478 2018-12-20 22:01:01 President Trump recently signed an executive order banning bump stocks.
I agree bump stocks should be banned, but it should've been done by legislative action.

Bad Trump, and Bad Republican Congress.
479 2018-12-20 22:00:47 SHUTDOWN: Stocks Tumble Another 500 Points! OY
480 2018-12-20 22:00:19 Stock drop: $ADMA and 68 other stocks drop. The Common Wealth is investigating! Reach out for more info. TheCommonWealth.mail@gmail.com #StockDrop #ADMA
481 2018-12-20 22:00:03 Sounds like a good number. Could also consider a score match with the timer instead of stock, it seems to be what Nintendo had in mind for tie-breakers in the official tourneys. First one I found seemed to be four stocks, eight minutes, but then we run time again.
482 2018-12-20 21:59:42 When he does something that actually betters the country & puts others first before himself & his cronies then yes I'll be happy. Bump stocks are a small start. Lets see him do something about health, education & the environment that doesn't devalue or destroy it. Less golf too.
483 2018-12-20 21:59:14 Trump just banned bump stocks...who is the please take our gun guy?
484 2018-12-20 21:59:08 Same boat. My retirement savings is tied up in stocks.
485 2018-12-20 21:58:16 It will be used as PR by the trump admin & the GOP to claim that they achieved criminal justice reform, just as the ban on bump stocks will be used to claim they attacked gun control. Please never let up on telling the public that & that it’s a mere start.
486 2018-12-20 21:57:53 Take it from me selling drugs is easy selling stocks is hard af
487 2018-12-20 21:57:42 Thank you for your knowledge and insight should I buy it at this level

what other stocks do you like
488 2018-12-20 21:57:19 No stocks left - only cryptocurrencies...
489 2018-12-20 21:56:20 Hey guys just put my entire life savings into the stocks market ready to live that wolf a Wall Street life babey awooooo~!
490 2018-12-20 21:56:17 Not to mention when they do bring up Obama,they never say he brought us out of one of worst, financial crisis. Stocks up, unemployment down, banks saved. Peoples livelihood saved. Not perfect by any means. But lets look at the apples and apples
491 2018-12-20 21:56:03 Except for certain stocks related to oligarchs. Is there evidence of stock impropriety here?
492 2018-12-20 21:56:02 U.S. Stocks to Face $64 Billion Pension Buying, Wells Fargo Says
493 2018-12-20 21:56:01 This apply too many stocks including $AAPL $FB
494 2018-12-20 21:55:45 Hell no! Most people iknow cant afford to dabble in stocks! Its for the rich and i hope they lose their shirts!
495 2018-12-20 21:55:06 Ahh I figured but thought I would ask. If you know what your doing “ which you definitely do “ than there is a good chance you can beat the index funds. I’m probably 75% stocks - 25% etfs.
496 2018-12-20 21:54:59 I'm  afraid to look at my stocks
497 2018-12-20 21:54:49 $SPY This flight to safety (utility stocks etc) makes no sense: u just lose less during bears, gain less during bulls.
498 2018-12-20 21:54:40 He's probably right because we don't "need" stocks while we all need housing.  That said, just like the stock market, we're coming off years of a bull market in housing.  This cool down we're seeing is a natural market pull-back cycle, not the sky falling on housing.
499 2018-12-20 21:54:36 Good point too because a lot of these pot stocks are hitting the big boards too like TSX, Nasdaq and NYSE. Those indexes will cause rise and fall  in pot stocks with closer ties to the general economy. I used to consider pot recession proof and it is, but the stocks are not?
500 2018-12-20 21:54:32 Folks stocks are deeply discounted and ripe for the picking! Get it while you can
501 2018-12-20 21:54:14 agreed. I wish there was a way to buy stocks in repl :)
502 2018-12-20 21:53:58 Will stocks in the #hemp and #CBD  industries get a boost from nationwide legalization..the end of #hemp prohibition?

#FarmBill18 #hempbill #CBDOIL #hempoil
503 2018-12-20 21:53:58 Bought some stocks a couple weeks ago after staying quiet for a long time, the market keeps dropping like it hadn’t in a long time  #storyofmylife
504 2018-12-20 21:53:52 It’s not just the country club crowd, it’s a lot of normal everyday hardworking people who can afford to put some money in some stocks who are watching their money lose value in huge percentages & may not have the financial ability to wait until it recovers
505 2018-12-20 21:53:39 Pot stocks are done 
506 2018-12-20 21:53:32 @realDonaldTrump Trump’s second year might represent a peak, with growth slowing in coming years and stocks anticipating a downturn. The S&P 500 is down 13% from its September high, with the market on track for its worst year since the crash of 2008. F%%% the Wall you have bigger
507 2018-12-20 21:53:08 Realign > Recreational Marijuana stocks!
508 2018-12-20 21:52:59 When did we start equating all power with bump stocks? Lol
509 2018-12-20 21:52:09 They are lying.Most probably don't even have a portfolio.
We are all pretty much diversified in the same stocks so there is no way theirs is doing well.
510 2018-12-20 21:51:58 The Trump effect can definitely cause stocks to plunge.  Just like it takes time to build a healthy economy, it takes time to destroy it...slowly, slowly...but it happens. Just what Putin ordered.
511 2018-12-20 21:51:39 Well we went to 52-week low today.  Are these stocks (CBB and CNSL) filing for bankruptcy? lol.  There is no reason for a stock to fall 30% to 40% in a week.  I did see some wild swings on the CNSL 2022 bonds though.  Do you think this is the reason it went down?
512 2018-12-20 21:51:29 manipulating the dow and stocks is one way the liberal billionaires likes to play.
513 2018-12-20 21:51:28 “oh no, my stocks!” I yelp while fucking my producer
514 2018-12-20 21:51:27 $GOOGL $GOOG  It will outshine all the other FANG stocks in 2019.  Waymo’s lead in the self-driving car will be the wild card!
515 2018-12-20 21:51:02 Hear! Hear! That should increase demand. Then Grimsby fishermen will be able to overfish them again - as in 1940s-60s and undo all the work done since the Cod Wars ended to help return North Sea cod stocks to sustainable levels (as was announced in April 2017).
516 2018-12-20 21:50:47 Market crashing, economy slowing, oil stocks dropping, housing starts dropping, jobs slowing, VA in disarray & you want to shut down the government for a wall that won't help the economy one bit!
517 2018-12-20 21:50:31 No Peter Lynch or Warren Buffett here, but I was one of many who advised you all leave stocks on 9 Nov 2016.

If you don't sell them all now, you're nuts.
518 2018-12-20 21:50:10 Possible Govt shutdown Friday after midnight. That’ll help drive stocks down 
519 2018-12-20 21:50:04 None of the marijuana related stocks really moved at all today.
520 2018-12-20 21:50:04 @realDonaldTrump Market crashing, economy slowing, oil stocks dropping, housing starts dropping, jobs slowing, VA in disarray & you want to shut down the government for a wall that won't help the economy one bit!
521 2018-12-20 21:49:44 W/ $XBI bear market/heavy $XBI tax-loss selling in overall ugly market, I'm taking advantage of sellers' misfortune by buying stocks trading well below private market value - $AITB $3s, $AVDL $2s, $LPTX $2s, $SGMO $10s.  Buying when others are fearful, great investment strategy.

524 2018-12-20 21:49:17 Stocks down again ...500 points amid confusion over government possible shutdown
525 2018-12-20 21:48:54 only if you sell the stocks.
526 2018-12-20 21:48:47 I should buy all my god children some NASDAQ stocks for Christmas. They’ll thank me in a decade.
527 2018-12-20 21:48:09 Plus individual stocks can be volatile. 

After I left I made good chunk of change on trading, but it requires either a ton of money in play and employing an analyst, or a lot of time to monitor and analyze on your own.
528 2018-12-20 21:47:43 You never said a word when stocks were climbing. It's only fitting that you shut your mouth when they go down.
529 2018-12-20 21:47:20 You think there’s not much more margin calls to drive stocks lower?
530 2018-12-20 21:46:50 Cool. I see a lot of stocks breaking down and working way way lower. The market is a discounter of the future. So, you may not know profits are deteriorating until it's too late. Ask the investors of $NVDA, $AAPL and $FDX about that....
531 2018-12-20 21:46:28 @ChubsyUbsy And yes, it's all one market and Stocks and Indices all correlated. Some can lead or lag of course
532 2018-12-20 21:46:21 And the pain we feel goes along ways in reminding us later. Holding pot stocks through the Harper years was painful! haha. I can still feel the sting so I have slowed my quest to buy American stocks before their own legalization. Thats worked thus far! Im about to buy though.
533 2018-12-20 21:45:38 Let's see, no inflation, flat yield curve, stocks are off 7-8% in last 30 days....all that points to a slowing economy.  Then the FOMC continues to raise interest rates, they want to accelerate a slowdown.  Little ass backwards
534 2018-12-20 21:45:28 Those names haven't cracked enough for my liking. Boeing fox ex still pretty parabolic. Those stocks will turn if market turns though
535 2018-12-20 21:45:02 DJIA only tracks 30 stocks & there's been a lot of swaps over the years. I think S&P 500 would be a better index to use.
536 2018-12-20 21:44:59 This is why I short sell stocks. Not buy them. At this point, there is more DOWNSIDE potential than upside. Ka ching!
537 2018-12-20 21:44:58 The Fed should ignore the market, agreed. Your rationale, however, is misguided. A goodly portion of the 15% of stocks owned by us in the 90% constitutes a meaningful element of our assets. To suggest the 85/15 ratio is pertinent misses that fact.
538 2018-12-20 21:44:04 help me! my stocks........
539 2018-12-20 21:43:37 Although I won’t be entering any positions with the general market as it is currently (listener to age old wisdom), I do like the look of a couple of names...

540 2018-12-20 21:43:33 Hmm, let's see...prison reform, pulling out of Syria, banning of bump stocks, record low employment..looks pretty good to me.
541 2018-12-20 21:43:29 I still dont see people jumping from stocks to crypto. The phrase "Out of the frying pan into the fire" springs to mind.
542 2018-12-20 21:43:26 This has not aged well. Stocks down significantly for the year.

548 2018-12-20 21:40:45 And if they planned to withdraw from their stocks or mutual funds to help get by, they are down.
549 2018-12-20 21:40:43 Just out of curiosity, do you ever buy etf’s or do you just stick to picking stocks? I own VYM and SPTM
550 2018-12-20 21:40:14 How is it unlawful? I'm pretty sure there is no legislation saying bump stocks are mandatory?
551 2018-12-20 21:40:12 There are always some stocks that are in a bull market despite of the general market calamity.

557 2018-12-20 21:37:36 It is manipulated like crazy, I have been fooling with stocks for years and I watch stuff happening on regular stocks starting at 3 am central time, it’s manipulation and those  bastards make more money shorting than they do going up, just wished my account allowed me to short
558 2018-12-20 21:37:21 He signed??
559 2018-12-20 21:37:10 I can go either way on this. Context dependent. Sometimes all ppl want is a pep talk, or some quick narrative context. 

You see this when clients want to blow money on weed stocks or PonziCoin or whatever. They don’t want a valuation lesson. They just want permission.
560 2018-12-20 21:37:08 To be perfectly honest it's kind of Genius that he even got away with just doing bump stocks. Like the Tweet mentioned above binary triggers would have been a worst loss along with other modifications styles that makes use of a firearm more efficient and ultimately safer
561 2018-12-20 21:36:47 Zero people injured or killed this year by a bump stock. 360,000. People injured or killed this year do to texting and driving. Yep, bump stocks sure are a big problem.
562 2018-12-20 21:35:56 #Lait : des perspectives plutôt favorables pour le début d’année 2019 en raison de stocks  d’intervention qui se vident (100 000 t de poudre de lait stockée  aujourd’hui contre 370 000 début 2018), ce qui permet une remontée des cours  et une baisse de la collecte européenne.

569 2018-12-20 21:34:23 $NEM, $ABBV, $VRTX, $PPL, and $ATVI are the top five stocks that closed higher today.
570 2018-12-20 21:34:12 Bump stocks are accessories, not weapons. Stupid accessories, but I would have thought you'd know the difference.
571 2018-12-20 21:34:11 Or until their stocks hit zero.  They are getting close.
572 2018-12-20 21:33:56 @ZaslowShow what was the name of that company for stocks you announced on the radio?
573 2018-12-20 21:33:55 Who wants stocks for Christmas?
574 2018-12-20 21:33:46 $GE, $AMD, $BAC, $T, and $MU were the top five most active stocks today.
575 2018-12-20 21:33:44 Could be lots of people buying calls.

And no one buying stocks.
576 2018-12-20 21:33:44 Stocks closed today 22859, a 14-month low. Can't wait to see how they blame THIS on Obama.
577 2018-12-20 21:33:41 This was caused by @realDonaldTrump stupid policies, his failed #TradeWar , his #TaxScam, and the #TrumpShutdown. You can pump stocks by cutting tax for the rich but like all "steroids" shots it wore off. Trump killed longest Bull Run in history. #TrumpRecession is coming #MAGA
578 2018-12-20 21:33:28 It's clear that the equity markets have been making lower lows and lower highs all week so downtrend intact and from a technical standpoint still suggesting a bottom has not yet been formed.
Many, myself included, were probably thinking a Santa rally would lift stocks this week.
579 2018-12-20 21:33:28 I hear ya. Stocks have taken a beating. So has my 401-K
580 2018-12-20 21:33:22 Worst part is almost all companies cash out stocks and options for holiday bonuses last Friday before Christmas.... bullish
581 2018-12-20 21:33:04 this one trolls me, yet can’t answer a question. poor boy. added another 10% equities today, with indexes down 2.5%. added indexes and individual stocks that were down 3-5%. 30% equity exposure, will add every 2.5-5% down. TL? still waiting you,little child 
582 2018-12-20 21:32:51 This was caused by @realDonaldTrump stupid policies, his failed #TradeWar , his #TaxScam, and the #TrumpShutdown.

583 2018-12-20 21:32:50 Consistent losses in US stocks would be a good test for the indexing and low turnover community.
584 2018-12-20 21:32:45 Look... Bump stocks kinda violate the law... so yeah.
585 2018-12-20 21:32:32 @realDonaldTrump is a fraud and frauds must be removed and thrown into the trash with all the frauds!
In the past 3 months, stocks and shares have dropped to levels before @realDonaldTrump became President! He has NOT lived up to his word as the trade war is hitting home!
586 2018-12-20 21:32:18 When it hits rock bottom I’m buying mad stocks lol
587 2018-12-20 21:32:10 stocks really don't have much of a effect on BTC but if we start to actually see a large scale currency crisis and capital controls that is when we BTC take flow -- just like during the 2015-2016 CNY devalution
588 2018-12-20 21:32:08 You literally can bump fire using just your trigger finger and body technique, bump stocks just made it easier but not required. So are they going to ban index fingers now? Cut them off and turn them in to the government as well?
589 2018-12-20 21:31:56 And who is going to pay for it?  Stock market failing, corporation quadruple their stocks, and so much rich shit going on.
590 2018-12-20 21:31:54 However factually true WRT, this is nothing, but disingenuous.
1) If Obama banned bump stocks it would add fuel to the fire over “coming to take your guns” mentality on the right.
2) Obama didn’t START Syria. Obama wanted to counter Russian influence as did Republicans.
591 2018-12-20 21:31:54 The Fed halting increases will still be negative for stocks as it signals we are entering a slow down and will push the Fed to ease sooner rather than later. Coupled with a severely distorted policy and balance sheet unwind.
592 2018-12-20 21:31:46 Stocks down, but it's still not seeing the bottom ...
593 2018-12-20 21:31:42 You got bump stocks banned which did absolutely nothing to decrease gun violence. Hope you're so proud!
594 2018-12-20 21:31:37 Those old days. I shorted oil , natural gas, silver,gold , stocks..etc. with out knowing much and lost. After that I discovered bitcoin in 2013...
595 2018-12-20 21:31:10 Raising rates increases spending on non-stock market instruments so money is spread around in more places than just the stock market. 

Interest rate increases = less in stocks, more in CDs, bonds, and HYS accounts.

It isn't a conspiracy to create a recession and bring down DJT.
596 2018-12-20 21:30:40 Alcohol and vice stocks
597 2018-12-20 21:30:32 I can't help but laugh when I read headlines that begin with 'Stocks clobbered as Trump...". This will be the worst quarter for the stock market since 2011 & the Dotard-in-Chief still thinks his economic policies are helping the US. Quite literally, #ThanksObama. @realDonaldTrump
598 2018-12-20 21:30:30 I have heard that narrative for years -- that crypto will pump when stocks dump, I am not sold on that being a 100% correlation, BTC could act like a high flying tech stock and tank even harder, or like most of it's existence operate outside of that system.
599 2018-12-20 21:30:18 Add to that Trump will definitely go for more than just bump stocks..  just you watch..
600 2018-12-20 21:30:17 Big Sale on Wall Street! Cheap Stocks!!
601 2018-12-20 21:29:53 Yep. Bitcoin to wma200. IWM wma200. AMD NVDA MU and pot stocks 50% haircuts. AAPL 50% retrace from 90 lows. The list goes on...
602 2018-12-20 21:29:53 as for bump stocks - obama could have done it if the republicans and NRA took the same position they do now.  but of course that never would have happened.
603 2018-12-20 21:29:48 Exactly. He deserves full support when he's right, but we need to speak up when he's dropping the ball. I still support him as president either way, because he has done a great job. That doesn't mean I support him when he unconstitutionally bans bump stocks, for example.
604 2018-12-20 21:29:45 @realDonaldTrump Banning bump stocks...a slippery slope at best.  How does this meet the words "shall not be infringed"?  The Patriots didn't imagine a government that had leaders who could not read.
605 2018-12-20 21:29:41 fed must maintain control at all times. they say when & how fast it bleeds. VIX still has`t spiked which means that nobody is buying put options as a hedge against their stocks crashing. Surrre they`re not. . . Even with 2018 gains erased. Panic? Why?!?  : \ What up with that?!?
606 2018-12-20 21:29:36 Stocks aren't serially correlated? You don't believe stocks fall just because they're falling and as they fall more that leads to more selling? Then, if they fall enough, it leads to panic selling? Because that is serial correlation...
607 2018-12-20 21:29:24 US stocks closed lower than they opened for the 8th consecutive day: $DJIA -464, $SPX -40
608 2018-12-20 21:29:15 US stocks closed lower than they opened for the 8th consecutive day: $DJIA -464, $SPX -40
609 2018-12-20 21:28:36 That's good for literally no one... Stocks crashing is what caused the great depression. This is destroying people's 401ks that they're relying heavily on for retirement.
610 2018-12-20 21:28:32 One this year my returns in my investment accounts were in the green. They have been in the red for months now. 

Maybe we should add tariffs to stocks. That’ll fix it, right? 
611 2018-12-20 21:28:07 i do agree with you, but stocks are kinda fucked all over the world, there is decent opportunity that someone pumps this market as a whole to attract attention as btc was created at the end of the 2008-09 recession.
we are not in a pretty common overall market structure.

613 2018-12-20 21:27:37 In the S&P 500, 423 stocks are below their 200-DMA.
614 2018-12-20 21:27:37 But my stocks in it are still down . Well whole market is bear !!
615 2018-12-20 21:27:34 Dear ultimate online community:

If you are one of the guys who puts 2 stocks on  your ruleset  let me tell you that none of your opinions matter and you don't have any right of speech ever again :)
616 2018-12-20 21:27:09 I've seen lots of praise on the left for the justice reform and from many on the bump stocks. While those of us on the left don't like being in Syria, he doesn't deserve any praise for not taking care of the Kurds.
617 2018-12-20 21:26:57 We have a long way to go, I’ve done. 100 already I may go another 100 in a few days if my stocks come up a bit to at least green lol big red right now and that is just pure manipulation causing that rich greedy bastards and not Trumps fault either
618 2018-12-20 21:26:48 @realDonaldTrump doesn’t own stocks so he doesn’t care. Too much transparency
619 2018-12-20 21:26:46 Did you stocks get hammered today?
620 2018-12-20 21:26:36 If we move all out of stocks anytime things get a little shaky, would underperform market badly. Buy high sell low is what happens to those that act on fear. Need to stick with the plan and not try to time the market. Current conditions fundamentally not alarming. Just turbulence
621 2018-12-20 21:26:27 @MaylanStudart Today shows’s the Stock Market is in the worse year ever. It’s lost more that almost 2000 points in like a week span. People now have the time to spend money on stocks if I goes up. Maylan is it the right time to buy stocks before it goes up again?
622 2018-12-20 21:26:09 I wonder how many 3D design files there are for bump stocks on the Internet today?
623 2018-12-20 21:25:51 Just my observation, but theoretically, if stocks do plunge, could investors rush to the dollar as a safe haven - pushing the $ to the 2nd resistance line?
624 2018-12-20 21:25:21 No. He doesn't do anything and he never hangs out with any "friends" he just doesn't. And LUL his company doesn't have stocks

630 2018-12-20 21:25:14 i understand that bump stocks could be issue for law enforcement and criminals....could have at least made them hard to get like a silencer. instead of out right banning them. DANGEROUS TERRITORY FOR TRUMP.
631 2018-12-20 21:25:08 The stock market is in a massive bubble. We're talking 5,000 points level. Going to see about reallocating my stocks to bonds then keeping the rest in stock (buy when it burns and money ye' will earn!).
632 2018-12-20 21:25:07 Yep dividend plays way to go imo. Penny stocks are dead money well most of them. Be winners I’m really hoping 2019 we turn up. But  I have my dpubts
633 2018-12-20 21:24:43 Harold, i understand your sentiments here. but, NHPI has been a different ballgame from rest of OTC stocks. Its hard to see LEGIT DDs in the OTC world... NHPI has everything one needs. Doherty timing to get the Merger PR out is delayed little bit because of the holiday season..
634 2018-12-20 21:24:28 The number of stocks in your portfolio should correspond with your investing skills, knowledge and experience.

Limited knowledge: Index funds
Some knowledge: Index funds
Good knowledge and experience: 8-15 stocks
Warren Buffett and Charlie level: 3-5 stocks
635 2018-12-20 21:24:27 the stock market isn't the economy, it's never their job to make sure stocks always go up
636 2018-12-20 21:23:56 This is a dumb stunt. People should take their money and go buy stocks!
637 2018-12-20 21:23:48 Why?  I have stocks (they’re down )... but why is that bad?  I don’t really know a lot about the market just stuck some money there...
638 2018-12-20 21:23:43 Some stocks have closed today at a 14month low 
639 2018-12-20 21:23:35 Well, every time is different, but there's nothing going on with today's economy that looks particularly similar to 1929.

Could we have a recession? Yes, we definitely will (although no one knows exactly when).

Will stocks decline more? No one knows, but wouldn't be surprising.
640 2018-12-20 21:23:19 Put them in the stocks with frustrated passengers getting first go with rotting fruit + eggs. Then give them 5 years community service then lock them up!
641 2018-12-20 21:23:18 At this point I'd be more surprised to see it closing on a gain. It's been so long since I saw my stocks colored in green I forget what that looks like.
642 2018-12-20 21:23:17 WATCH: RJ Grant, KBW’s Director of Equity Trading, will be on @CNBCClosingBell today at 4:50PM ET to discuss the current environment for bank stocks
643 2018-12-20 21:23:16 When crude oil eventually catches a bid.... yawn...
Watch U.S. Northeast dist stocks that are +14mb lower than 5-yr average
Should be fun.... #OOTT
644 2018-12-20 21:23:06 #BreakingNews  the @DowJones stocks  closed at their lowest point in 14 months. #HowDoYouEvenSpellRetirement
645 2018-12-20 21:23:02 Just found out. Since the White House wants to ban bump stocks, its nothing but putting fuel to the fire to hate Trump more.
646 2018-12-20 21:22:53 $spx $spy #stocks BTW, trading (or investing) not about calling bottoms/tops... though more interesting to tweet about. They’re both about understanding risk/reward, managing capital, being patient, taking profits... I try to chime in when conditions favorable for a given trade.
647 2018-12-20 21:22:45 Markets Right Now: Stocks plunge again, Dow sinks 464 points
648 2018-12-20 21:22:13 @RicherSounds Can you tell me if Oxford stocks Yamaha AS301
649 2018-12-20 21:21:57 In addition to the banning bump stocks, New Jersey has now banned large capacity clips for AR styled rifles. This is how it starts. Confiscation of all types of fire arms are just around the corner.

Most Own Bank Stocks& Bailed Banks Out=Helped THEIR OWN POCKETS! Know Laws Doing-Buy Health Stock?
652 2018-12-20 21:21:26 Most people don't care about bump stocks.  But it is anti 2a.  So it's stupid...
653 2018-12-20 21:21:25 Stocks are dead. 
654 2018-12-20 21:21:21 How about indicting FB, Twitter, Amazon, Soros, and other Billionaires Dems who are dumping a few Billion in stock and drive Stocks  down? #sickdems.
655 2018-12-20 21:21:12 When you worship Money more then anything else, the Dow/Stocks will always make you worry! Don't blame the Gov't because they are not your problem! What you put your Faith in Is!!
656 2018-12-20 21:21:03 Hulk Hogans heel turn is the equivalent of Trumps ban on bump stocks.
657 2018-12-20 21:20:54 Stocks are doing horrible . I just wanna pull all my money out and put it in a CD instead
658 2018-12-20 21:20:51 Bull market in stocks launched
659 2018-12-20 21:20:30 And as assumed stocks are crashing because of mentally disabled potus trump
660 2018-12-20 21:20:29 @TomiLahren bump stocks?
661 2018-12-20 21:20:21 Stocks - Dow's Dour December Continues Amid Turmoil in Washington
662 2018-12-20 21:20:11 $TEAM and $QNST closed in the green today. Super strong #stocks.
663 2018-12-20 21:20:02 Stocks and bonds?
664 2018-12-20 21:19:49 Take an Economics class, Jim. It’s a bit more complicated than that. Stop thinking with your gut. Let the economists decide our fed policy. Stick to picking stocks.
665 2018-12-20 21:19:45 We are on a path to a hell of a household wealth squeeze. Canadians are invested both in domestic RE and US stocks big time.
666 2018-12-20 21:19:36 And crypto quietly (no news) up 30-40% off the obvious bottom in 6 days as the sheeple lose 10% in stocks.
667 2018-12-20 21:19:31 Aren't we holding back on shooting it down since that would make finding the scrotes more difficult? Catching them is more likely whilst it's flying I suggest. Don't think PC stuff will apply in current circumstances. When the twat(s) is/are caught then put them in the stocks.
668 2018-12-20 21:19:28 Hmm probably not I added a couple stocks I think and like some new fonts and tips and the full psd of my blaazy header
669 2018-12-20 21:19:26 Thank you for people finally understanding the impact of interest rate movement on stocks. I know everyone blames trump for everything but he has no impact on this. It’s why he has verbally come out disagreeing with the fed jumping rates right now
670 2018-12-20 21:19:11 Do you know when we are going to see a reversal in the stock market? When most of the analysts start to say that stocks are overvalued. At this time most of them still think that stocks are cheap and there are great opportunities to buy. This can take more than a year.
671 2018-12-20 21:19:06 When stocks are good he takes credit, can’t wait to hear him spin this and blame Democrats, Fake News and Boarder Security for it now. Stupid Idiot in Chief, 10% down. How’s the tax cut working out?
672 2018-12-20 21:18:30 Twitter stocks down by 11%
673 2018-12-20 21:18:04 Oh the hemp stocks are going to start lining up...
674 2018-12-20 21:17:21 Remember how Trump demanded praise for rising stocks before passing any economic legislation?
 
-   10/1/17: Trump’s first budget takes effect. Dow Jones at 22,405
-   12/22/17: Trump’s tax cut signed.  Dow Jones at 24,754
 
12/20/18.   Dow closes at 22,859
675 2018-12-20 21:17:13 Paula, lives on Bluebird Canyon with too many roommates.

Put all their savings into maca root stocks. Can't retire.
676 2018-12-20 21:16:57 Interest rates have been stupid low for several years, and needed to come up. As rising interest rates make bonds more attractive relative to stocks, the stock market is going to take a hit. Not exactly rocket science.
677 2018-12-20 21:16:53 So far so good but we’ll see....  let me know when you start buying.  Any thoughts on gold stocks.  I bought $KL @$22 and $AEM @$38
678 2018-12-20 21:16:22 No way, Trump said that since his election stocks have skyrocketed so you're just saying FAKE NEWS!
And if some stocks fall down it's because sellers believe FAKE NEWS! 

lol
679 2018-12-20 21:16:19 I do, I just thought you only traded stocks...LOL
680 2018-12-20 21:16:08 Good thing I ended my Stocks Expert brand before the market downturn otherwise I might be like Jim Cramer. Wildly successful despite helping to cause hundreds of bankruptcies
681 2018-12-20 21:15:57 One of the key things to do right now for #investors is to keep a long term view on #investing in the #StockMarket...things will pick up...my assets are primarily allocated to #banking and #energy (#oilandgas) #stocks and we know how those sectors look these days - staying calm.
682 2018-12-20 21:15:50 @stephenhnelson selling all his tech stocks and buying $GE #smh
683 2018-12-20 21:15:34 We should be celebrating that the 1% owning 80% of the stocks is feeling the heat
684 2018-12-20 21:15:25 Any gold stocks that you like right now?
685 2018-12-20 21:14:51 But if you got proof Obama tried to ban bumps stocks post it that’s all you gotta do is back up your claims why is it so hard perhaps because it didn’t happen 
686 2018-12-20 21:14:42 #stocks continue to sell off as $DJI breaks support while #gold takes out resistance. Join Coach Frank over on YouTube at 4:30 Eastern to discuss today's price action in the Market Recap #trading
687 2018-12-20 21:14:41 @darrenrovell with stocks being hit so hard right now, do you see any gambling/sports betting related stocks as good buying opportunities now? Seems this industry is on the verge of taking off in the US combined with low stock prices
688 2018-12-20 21:14:40 Jim Cramer described exactly this. Martin Skreli used to do this to pharma stocks before his whole drug pricing thing
689 2018-12-20 21:14:29 Interest rates were raised due to how strong the economy is, but that causes stocks to plummet.
690 2018-12-20 21:14:27 Trump’s bullshit rhetoric is costing me money in stocks...The DOW is down so much! Fuck Trump!! #fucktrump #trumpsucks #stopcostingmemoney #ihateyoutrump
691 2018-12-20 21:14:27 Why would any company want to risk investment/capital in Canada?  Really, Canada is NOT a safe place to invest, even for Canadians right now.  Selling just my Canadian stocks, going to cash.
692 2018-12-20 21:14:18 Stocks down
Unemployment will rise
Debt will rise
Interest rates will rise
Inflation will rise

Trump cant run a simple business
So hes going to trash the economy
Why?
Because he has no clue
693 2018-12-20 21:14:18 Okay, cool.  Let a rock n roll magazine right that.  When the CEO of Rollings Stone can pass legislation I'll worry. I don't buy into the "its a giant plan".  How is banning a completely unnecessary modification to a gun a plan?  We don't need bump stocks.
694 2018-12-20 21:13:59 Because this is a bullshit characterization. 1. Republicans would never have passed bipartisan criminal justice reform under Obama simply because they hated him. Dems should get the credit-not Trump. 2. Obama admin determined Congress hadn't granted authority to ban bump stocks
695 2018-12-20 21:13:45 apple stocks rise by 69%.

699 2018-12-20 21:13:00 NASDAQ flirting with ‘bear’ market. In times like this, I find this @DavidGFool quote useful: “Stocks always go down faster than they go up, but they always go up more than they go down”. I am buying stocks. Are you?
700 2018-12-20 21:12:58 The NRA has called for a federal regulation to ban sales or possession of bump stocks... where is a simple “thank you NRA and President Trump...”????
701 2018-12-20 21:12:52 Stocks are up ?!? Pardon ?
702 2018-12-20 21:12:52 There should be a giant LONG ONLY sign above anyone on TV under that mandate pitching stocks....

$XLE $USO $SPY $MSFT $XLK
703 2018-12-20 21:12:51 Can you point to rule what day you can fish is? I guess as a family of fisherman youll know the exact law? yes being out at sea is expensive but the EU is not making sure you don't earn enough is it, its policy is not to make it difficult to earn money, its to control fish stocks
704 2018-12-20 21:12:22 I am willing to bet he has very little money in stocks (or at all) He is not smart or patient and I think you need those things w/ stocks
705 2018-12-20 21:12:17 If you weren't so busy drinking and driving you may have time to see the big picture.  Nobody gives a shit about the bump stocks.  Put the bottle down and think about it.
706 2018-12-20 21:12:09 When they eventually catch the fuckers messing things up at Gatwick, I reckon they should put them in the middle of the airport in stocks & let travellers disrupted by them pelt them with rotten fruit. Then lock them up for a long time in stinking clothes with no showers.
707 2018-12-20 21:12:02 Stocks dive again as more investors cash out, though major indexes end up from lows.
Dow -464, -2.0% to 22,859.

S&P -1.6%. Nasdaq -1.6% and briefly traded at a level down more than 20% from its peak -- i.e., official bear mkt

After Wed. rate hike is Fed now sweating bullets?
708 2018-12-20 21:11:44 Each player will start with a traditional 50 stocks, or 'lives',
709 2018-12-20 21:11:38 I guess there was no ink in Obama’s pen to outlaw bump stocks
710 2018-12-20 21:11:05 My god, send this lady to Europe or Japan please. Keeping stocks artificially expensive, prices an entire generation of would be investors out. Let markets be markets, and stop with all the manipulation/welfare for the wealthy schemes.
711 2018-12-20 21:10:49 Follow the money. Who is quietly buying up all these low stocks?
712 2018-12-20 21:10:30 Yeah, I've lost over $150 per share on one of my highest performing stocks. He's a shitshow and needs to be removed from office.
713 2018-12-20 21:10:16 World markets continue tumbling: US  -1.6%;Europe -1.8%. Fear of FED, slowing growth & Trump behavior causing too much uncertainty for sane market behavior. Doesn’t matter that many quality growth stocks are on sale at deep discount. Long-term solid - short-term unknowable.
714 2018-12-20 21:10:12 I'm buying stocks on a daily basis..buy low sell high
715 2018-12-20 21:10:09 Dems take congress and stocks crash.
716 2018-12-20 21:09:49 @realDenaldTrump I'm so glad you're making stocks cheaper to buy.  Under your FANTASTIC and WINNING economic policies, stocks will practically cost nothing!!! #MAGA!
717 2018-12-20 21:09:40 My money is to be saved for rent, food and to buy stocks. Survival and investments are my only priorities forever and always
718 2018-12-20 21:09:20 Name one platform outside of Twitter where people globally are talking nonstop about the economy, stocks, global warming, politics, sports, news, products, experiences, and so much more. 

I'll wait. Till then LONG $TWTR
719 2018-12-20 21:09:11 Cash out your stocks now folks: the @GOP is, once again, destroying our country and economy. #runnow #GOPTaxScam #cashout
720 2018-12-20 21:08:53 all stocks plunges into bear region.
721 2018-12-20 21:08:51 Stocks:  the only thing people want to buy more of when prices are going higher and less of when prices are going lower.  
722 2018-12-20 21:08:42 okay but what stocks would jungkook invest in
723 2018-12-20 21:08:38 Congrats #GOP and #POTUS...Stocks tanking...handing Syria over to Russia...and gov't shutdown looming...Great job! Great Christmas Present for those who supported you.
724 2018-12-20 21:08:32 So those @realDonaldTrump tax cuts for corporations that the corporations used on stock buybacks to increase the value of the stocks is really paying off well just one year later 
725 2018-12-20 21:08:32 Lying @foxnews saying stocks fall over govt shutdown fears. 
No. It’s the hikes in Fed interest rate you dummies.
726 2018-12-20 21:08:16 For argument’s sake, what do you think the reaction from the right would have been if Obama unilaterally banned bump stocks?
727 2018-12-20 21:08:06 Red reversal in bonds today.  Maybe good sign for stocks next few days? $TLT $SPY
728 2018-12-20 21:08:05 Correction was long overdue. They could only prop stocks up artificially for so long
729 2018-12-20 21:08:04 Don’t buy stocks—buy crypto instead!
730 2018-12-20 21:07:56 lol I'm not worried. Stocks always go back up. It's the circle of life.

734 2018-12-20 21:07:11 God bless my stocks.. lost 150 in the past month
735 2018-12-20 21:07:11 I'll say yikes. Two stocks?

NASDAQ AT LOWEST LEVEL SINCE OCT. 2017
DOW AT LOWEST LEVEL SINCE OCT. 2017
s&p 500 VOLUME 40% HIGHER THAN LAST 20-DAY AVG. 
S&P 500 AT LOWEST LEVEL SINCE SEPT. 2017
U.S. STOCKS ON PACE FOR WORST YEAR SINCE 2008
737 2018-12-20 21:06:54 Info. Soros is reason for Dow. He selling off his stocks he shouldn't be allowed to be invested threathing to destroy usa
738 2018-12-20 21:06:50 Twitter stocks down 11.2% today
739 2018-12-20 21:06:42 An extremely volatile last 24 hours has seen stocks slip further with the Dow down 600 points at one point. All US indices are currently down almost 2% on the day with Gold jumping to its highest recent levels around 1265 as investors switch to safe havens.
740 2018-12-20 21:06:34 Pharmacy stocks have been getting their asses whopped. I need to make money!
741 2018-12-20 21:06:28 Neither does my economist friend who worked on Wall Street for 7 years.
If he's done such a great job why have the Stocks done that being in toilet thing? 
I'm trying to invest a certain sum of money & I'm afraid to put it anywhere bc of this.
742 2018-12-20 21:05:15 Stay tough on border security and the wall! Don’t ban bump stocks they aren’t the problem! Great work Mr President
743 2018-12-20 21:05:12 436 of the S&P 500 stocks closed down today, 64 closed up. 

87% of $SPX stocks closed lower today.
744 2018-12-20 21:05:03 Jobs are now leaving..HD, GM. Stocks at record lows, he’s subsidizing farmers because of tariffs, he lied about steel factories...none being built, deficit highest ever, and he’s got you paying for the wall. Save some money, he’ll have a fund site for his legal fees.
745 2018-12-20 21:04:55 All stocks are down!
746 2018-12-20 21:04:53 I hope when I’m older my husband stocks up the house with keptchup crisps and never lets me run out :(
747 2018-12-20 21:04:39 S&P down 1.5%. TLT down 0.4%. But USTs are soaring in this stocks’ collapse...
748 2018-12-20 21:04:25 An extremely volatile last 24 hours has seen stocks slip further with the Dow down 600 points at one point. All US indices are currently down almost 2% on the day with Gold jumping to its highest recent levels around 1265 as investors switch to safe havens.
749 2018-12-20 21:04:10 My stocks are plummeting due to Trump and he wants to starve children?
750 2018-12-20 21:03:49 Yes, but what percent of the country owns stocks (401k, their DB plan)?  Bezos, Buffett, etc skew the wealth ownership of stocks.
751 2018-12-20 21:03:14 Hey @realDonaldTrump, thanks for tanking my stocks today. AGAIN! BAD.
752 2018-12-20 21:03:12 Repubs intentionally damage the market to profit from it & buy stocks at lows; snatch up real estate when prices become depressed. I suspect that is why Repubs kept fussing w/ CFPB. Repubs want to benefit from their own poor policies. No Democrat like Obama to save the economy.
753 2018-12-20 21:02:59 If the price of great stocks go down it is time to buy. By lo sell high.
754 2018-12-20 21:02:51 the clown and principals? hahahaha, what a joke. the country is in chaos, stocks on the way to WORSTyear in a decade, gov shut down almost certain. LIAR.  SCAMMER.  INCOMPETENT CON ARTIST.   MULTIPLE BANKRUPT.   SHAME!!!!!!   SHAME!!!!!!

760 2018-12-20 21:02:00 MJ stocks crashing 
761 2018-12-20 21:01:52 Technology stocks are a fool’s favorite. Health care stocks have been the ones earning the most lately. At least as far as mutual funds go.
762 2018-12-20 21:01:46 Easy monetary policies and massive bond-buying from the world’s biggest central banks have been credited with fueling the yearslong rally in global stocks and dampening volatility.
763 2018-12-20 21:01:43 You realize the ATF repeatedly ruled it could not legally ban bump stocks and it would require an act of congress to do so and that's why Obama didn't do it? And if he directed his DOJ to do it after they deemed it impossible he'd savaged *and* it would fall in court?
764 2018-12-20 21:01:37 The Dow index is down again. Mainly because of overvalued tech stocks (p/e) and fear of trump's trade wars. I feel sorry for the small pension investors, I don't cry for the speculators.
765 2018-12-20 21:01:37 Ahh yea I remember you mentioning that about $so. One of my favorite stocks. A lot of people don’t like Utilities. I do! Let me know if you get back in.
766 2018-12-20 21:01:35 And u gotta look at individual stocks too not just the market Right now there's nothing out there that looks like it's building for breakout
767 2018-12-20 21:01:31 There is no legitimate reason for people to possess bump stocks. Selling, possessing, or using this device should be a felony.
768 2018-12-20 21:01:22 Highflying stocks like @netflix , @amazon and $APPL that have benefited from years of easy money and low rates came under fresh pressure, all declining about 2%.
769 2018-12-20 21:01:20 YOUR stocks wend DOWN when Trump took the Helm? Not only are you an Idiot but you should not invest either. I think you'd best go buy #Algore's Carbon Credits.
770 2018-12-20 21:00:53 Now is actually the best time to buy stocks since they're cheaper.
771 2018-12-20 21:00:37 The top 10% of wealth in this country owns roughly 85% of the stocks. Maybe it makes sense for the Fed to ignore the stock mkt this time around
772 2018-12-20 21:00:36 Stocks heading down again heading for the close. Dow  -544 pts/22,778. S&P -1.9%; Nasdaq -1.8%; Russell -1.3%. WTI -4.4%/$46.08. 10-yr 2.795%. VIX 27.87. #markets #economy #federalreserve @anthonymace

777 2018-12-20 20:59:45 I don’t know which bit you don’t get. But arguing about fish stocks, even if it is broadly correct,  doesn’t win the Brexit argument.
778 2018-12-20 20:59:44 The stocks were at an artificial high from the tax cuts. They are dropping back to expected levels now and will continue to tank.
779 2018-12-20 20:59:43 But trade wars are easy to win, remember. This actually plays well for me. Crater stocks now so I buy low. Retiring in 4-5 years and the market should be moving again. I hope!
780 2018-12-20 20:59:24 The S&P 500 down more than 7% year-to-date, heightening the likelihood that 2018 ends up the worst year for stocks since the Great Recession.
781 2018-12-20 20:59:03 @benshapiro  I think that your position on bump stocks is incorrect. I’d be interested in hearing your justification.   I’d love the opportunity to change your mind .
782 2018-12-20 20:58:55 The Stock Market is going down because the FED #Globalists continue to RAISE INTEREST RATES. 
Buy Stocks NOW. Buy Index Funds.
783 2018-12-20 20:58:54 My stocks are plummeting and he is playing games for his base
784 2018-12-20 20:58:27 Check out 10Y and 30Y bond yields this afternoon in the face of this accelerating equity sell-off.

As I said, I'm doubtful of the thesis that crashing stocks are going to flush everyone into USTs.
785 2018-12-20 20:57:58 Don't you @realDonaldTrump get it yet?
NO ONE TRUSTS YOU!
Stocks tanking because YOU LIE and contradict yourself.
World peace tanking because YOU LIE and CAN'T BE TRUSTED!

The only wall you need is the one of a jail cell that keeps you from doing more harm!
YOU ARE A MOB BOSS!
786 2018-12-20 20:57:48 Who cares about a Wall; my stocks are plummeting.
787 2018-12-20 20:57:38 Shepard Smith is a drama queen. Stocks have been fluctuating all day not just since POTUS spoke. Shepard Smith is fake news!!!!
788 2018-12-20 20:57:35 It all about stocks. No war no stocks.
789 2018-12-20 20:57:32 This must be one of the promises made to Puttin. Guess this will get you more oil stocks since you don't believe in divesting.
790 2018-12-20 20:57:29 One last thing(s), since 1926 stocks average a 34% growth in the 12 months directly following a 10-20% correction. Third year of presidential terms are also historically the best, regardless of party.
791 2018-12-20 20:57:21 I tried to open another brokerage account to buy some stocks and couldn’t because my ID is expired. I tried an hour ago and that stock has already moved up 40 cents
792 2018-12-20 20:57:13 My stocks are plummeting because of this jerk. Indict him so we can save the economy
793 2018-12-20 20:56:53 Wishing you the same Marty. Things will stabilize, but the highs may be gone for awhile. Look to move stocks into Consumer Non-Durables sectors. Seems the most stable.
794 2018-12-20 20:56:28 The sheer amount of mental gymnastics here is astounding. It's not tRumps fault when the stocks tank but he deserves credit when it's good. Hypocrisy.
795 2018-12-20 20:56:00 There’s more to this issue, though. I’ve never owned one, nor had the desire to. But this is simply a step toward something. No buy-back, no grandfather. Rolling Stone magazine has already written an article stating the problem isn’t bump stocks, it’s all semi-autos.
796 2018-12-20 20:56:00 Might be time to revisit the timeless advice of Andrew Mellon: “Liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers, liquidate real estate. It will purge the rottenness out of the system.... ”

Dow off about 600 points, 5 minutes to go.
797 2018-12-20 20:55:54 Never buying stocks again.
798 2018-12-20 20:55:49 @CNBCClosingBell @SaraEisen what the he’ll difference does the wall have to do with the market. Carli is out of her mind. That just proves clear as day it’s emotional selling. Ceo is staying political zero affect on stocks.  The wall. Haaaa laughable.
799 2018-12-20 20:55:20 STOCKS DOWN 575, MAYBE THEY R FIGURING IN THE PRESIDENT IS A MADMAN IN PUTINS POCKET, just sayin
800 2018-12-20 20:55:14 Not an argument, but were bump stocks really on the radar b4 their use in the Las Vegas shootings? I know I had never heard the term b4.
801 2018-12-20 20:55:05 BUILD THE WALL (around people trying to sell stocks)
802 2018-12-20 20:55:02 En fait , j'ai regardé ; à l'époque 2100 dossiers avaient été examinés et c'est de cette analyse que découlent vos 10%. Les 18 millions de stocks étaient les numéros en circulation mais cela ne signifie pas que ces 10% s'appliquent sur les 18 millions, on peut avoir plus ou moins
803 2018-12-20 20:54:54 Bump stocks sole purpose is to enable a gun to kill more faster. GFU
804 2018-12-20 20:54:52 #StockMarket crash is due to the eminent drastic increase in oil prices,   everyone is selling stocks to buy oil futures,  not good
805 2018-12-20 20:54:45 tRUMP doesn't make laws, no. But the prohibition against bump stocks didn't come from him.
806 2018-12-20 20:54:43 Put the person in stocks in the airport, so stranded passengers have someone to talk to..
807 2018-12-20 20:54:39 $SPX I could see a huge buy into weekend on short covering, but stocks scary
808 2018-12-20 20:54:33 Buy my stocks?
809 2018-12-20 20:54:14 Put in the buy orders. Ramp the f..ng stocks
810 2018-12-20 20:54:07 Thanks! 
811 2018-12-20 20:54:00 Do you even know what semi-automatic means?

That glock is semi-automatic. 

Be careful of those AR-15's though. I heard they can go fully semi automatic with the 12000 round clipazines per minute and those gosh darn bump stocks shooting 500 caliber boolets.
812 2018-12-20 20:54:00 For all you snobs who say you won't trade low priced stocks, your ticker selection is dwindling.
813 2018-12-20 20:53:50 i can hit you with some of the top performing stocks in the s&p this year: amd, trip, fox, cmg, nflx, lly, and amzn.
814 2018-12-20 20:53:43 The stocks plummeted after Trump said he would veto the spending bill.  The market was artificially booming because of corporate tax cuts that led to stock buybacks.  Trumps crappy policies are bringing the market back down to Earth
815 2018-12-20 20:53:36 As the broader #StockMarket continues to tank and be in bearish territory, it’s time to re-focus on long term #investing and potentially go hunting for bargain #stocks. #Banking and #energy, especially #oilandgas, seem to provide some great buying opportunities: $WFC $ENB $XOM $C
816 2018-12-20 20:52:56 I jumped on a ffa on smash with mii brawler and I took very minimal damage and kept my three stocks, everyone says he sucks but holy shit he can slap a bitch.
817 2018-12-20 20:52:53 PPL scared shutdown government. Stocks drop
818 2018-12-20 20:52:45 Stocks fall further into negative territory as Trump says any funding bill "must include" border wall funding.
819 2018-12-20 20:52:45 We are seeing a perfect example of the potential usefulness of a world currency not influenced by a government. In the USA, we had the Federal Reserve increase interest rates again on Wednesday. Stocks reacted negatively hurting companies and investors. At least with Bitcoin,
820 2018-12-20 20:52:37 many stocks at multi year lows (some 3+ years) but volatility is no where close to levels of 3 years ago, not even at the Feb level yet. Something is not right with this. IS WS selling everything they own and have no need for vol hedges or what?
821 2018-12-20 20:52:29 Why is it so hard for people to see the massive insider trading scandal in the WH. Trump and Co are making a killing on defense contractor stocks. Follow the money!
822 2018-12-20 20:52:20 After Canada legalization what happened to all those big Canadian stocks? I expect the same with hemp stocks. Opinion only based on past
823 2018-12-20 20:52:14 Correct!  Rolling Stone magazine has already written that the problem wasn’t really bump stocks, but rather semi-autos. 
So it begins...
824 2018-12-20 20:51:59 People rotating out of stocks and into the wall gofundme page.
825 2018-12-20 20:51:57 @sullivanradio tRump has gambled on stock market (not economy), the “Wall” and draining the swamp. tRump has failed in each case. Stocks at historic low for December. Many of his hired swamp indicted and failure to have Mexico pay for a needless wall.
826 2018-12-20 20:51:41 just cashed out a few more stocks... market too risky b. cash is king in times like these
827 2018-12-20 20:51:28 Stocks are falling. And they might just dump into the close.

I've seen it happen too many times in my 7 years as a portfolio manager.

But I've never seen it this ugly in December. It's practically unprecedented.

Take caution and protect your assets.

#StockMarket #markets
828 2018-12-20 20:51:16 Hot singles in your area are buying stocks.
829 2018-12-20 20:51:11 the final #MOC number is little changed the sell to buy ratio of SPX stocks today is 6:1 and DOW30 has 26 to sell vs 2 buy
830 2018-12-20 20:51:01 In an environment like this it may be better to selectively choose a few stocks that could outlast some of the external pressures of the current market place. It could be a case where funds head in that direction as well, considering some of the steep losses they might have taken
831 2018-12-20 20:50:54 Logs, Stocks and Two Empty Barrels #FilmsThatFloat
832 2018-12-20 20:50:50 Dont worry about it, it always adjusts just ride it out, i have had stocks since i was 21 best thing is just ride it out dont panic.
833 2018-12-20 20:50:38 I think we're oversold.  Only 15% of stocks above 200 DMA.  This is only third time since 09' (11' and 16').  Even if downturn continues not going down in a straight line.  Not a trader, but this is a trader's market....
#StockMarket
834 2018-12-20 20:50:37 Or investors are beginning to realize how overvalued stocks were without artificial stimulus.
835 2018-12-20 20:50:28 im ugly, married, and buying stocks
836 2018-12-20 20:50:27 >banning bump stocks
Big whoop

>claiming victory and destabilizing an area like bush did
YASSSSS so great

Criminal justice reform the only thing I'll give him
837 2018-12-20 20:49:58 Why are you fighting for our enemies against the 2nd Ammendment, illegally banning bump stocks? The Constitution is to protect citizens from Govt. How could we ever stand up to Govt if they have high firing weapons and we do not? #NOWALL #2ndAmBanBumpstocks. We need to Fire @GOP!
838 2018-12-20 20:49:47 Did Don Jr. Just buy a bunch of stocks in steel slats?

840 2018-12-20 20:49:23 “Stocks turned down sharply” ? 

Wonder how many of his buddies had significantly shorted the market before today’s news ? 

He’s playing with peoples lives here... while simultaneously playing on people’s fears

841 2018-12-20 20:49:23 There's no difference volatility wise between blue chip and penny stocks right now.
842 2018-12-20 20:49:08 Why 3 stocks???
843 2018-12-20 20:49:08 2% away from a Bear Market in stocks. I'm peeing my pants.

845 2018-12-20 20:48:19 Anyone betting heavy on your stocks today?
846 2018-12-20 20:48:02 My husband is now thanking me for insisting we sell stocks 6 months ago. Our 401k took a terrible hit in 2008 and hasn't recovered.
847 2018-12-20 20:47:54 Mouais ça reste pas pratique
Moi j'ai décidé que je terminerais mes stocks avant la fin
848 2018-12-20 20:47:49 His policies have been disastrous, but you're engaging in one of his more frequent fallacies by conflating the stock market directly with the broader economy. They weren't the same thing when stocks were surging, and they aren't the same now, either. Related, probably.
849 2018-12-20 20:47:23 All the hypes over after signing..major pullback in all hemp stocks
850 2018-12-20 20:46:56 LITERALLY TRADING PENNY STOCKS. WHAT A JOKE.
851 2018-12-20 20:46:35 there's no must/need for an economic recession to have a bear market in stocks. It is a bit of a "the street is wet, thus it must be raining" type of argument, as the street can be wet for many reasons other than rain.
852 2018-12-20 20:46:14 We knew the Fed would do do this as they did with crypto currencies and other stocks. Get rid of the Fed! We have the gold!
853 2018-12-20 20:45:42 Not really. The NRA manufacturers don’t make bump stocks, it’s more of a niche add on product.
854 2018-12-20 20:44:05 Small-cap stocks P/E (Russell 2000) ratio for trailing 12 months was 40.75 on 12/14, now safe to assume it is in the high 30's. The last time this index had a trailing P/E below 50 was during the Great Recession, roughly a decade ago.
855 2018-12-20 20:43:42 Please President Trump, save our stocks! 
856 2018-12-20 20:43:28 Oh great 
Treason continues as he’s helping Russian oligarch pal get Syria back and Russian stocks are flying
857 2018-12-20 20:42:57 Why are we letting a private banker control our economy? Stocks tank. 401k in the toilet. End the fed. Free market.
858 2018-12-20 20:42:56 I’m curious what they have to say about trump banning bump stocks! 
Earlier they were defending him for not banning them!! So are they all with him on his flip flop? Or for the very first time, are they mad about something trump did? 
859 2018-12-20 20:41:48 I can’t wait for soup and shampoo mini sets this Christmas - stocks me up til Feb
860 2018-12-20 20:41:45 Stock market is emotional and traders do not think but act without giving a pause. Fed raised interest rate the stock fell and added to this agony Trump wants to shut down the government and the stocks fell by 500 points. Will there be something more?
861 2018-12-20 20:41:24 This is absolutely insane. Farmers who are going under because of your dumb tariffs won't be amused. GM workers who are losing jobs aren't laughing either. Stocks are tanking. Govt workers won't be paid when you shut down. World leaders are laughing though.  #FailingPresident

868 2018-12-20 20:39:50 How are those stocks in Butt Plug LTD sitting with ya?
869 2018-12-20 20:39:17 If BTC is really inversely correlating with stocks right now, maybe it is signaling stocks are about to bounce a bit and BTC will drop the next few days. I don't know, just a theory.

894 2018-12-20 20:33:31 @POTUS YOUR #BumpStockVan is Unconstitutional.  ATF’s new bump stock regulation violates federal law, as bump stocks do not qualify as machineguns under the federal statute. It was imposed through regulations because Congress has repeatedly refused to amend the law to ban them
895 2018-12-20 20:33:16 good time to add a number of things. This is a year end liquidation. Then a wait and see for 2019. A chunk of this money comes back into quality income stocks that offer a decent risk adjusted return. Risk is being re priced?

901 2018-12-20 20:31:33 All those stocks you wanted to buy but valuation was too outrageous are now on sale. Love a good sell off 
902 2018-12-20 20:31:11 you can make a semi-auto rifle fire full auto easily with household items. Banning bump stocks is just a feel good law. Also #ShallNotBeInfringed isn't a hard concept to grasp.
903 2018-12-20 20:31:09 1 year ago: Don't touch my #BumpStock
Now: Im OK with banning bump stocks.

Mother fucker, you're just as bad as the little bitches who say "just sayin". Own your own thoughts assholes.
904 2018-12-20 20:30:42 @realdonaldtrump when ppl say u don't care about gun violence. Just say it was you not I-Bombed (Obama) that outlawed bump stocks. 
You need to be happy with laughing at my I-bomb joke & NEVER say it. It's tacky. Some things u must never say. I can cuz I'm fluff. Not President.
905 2018-12-20 20:30:39 stocks had all the juice in the world sin e 09 and that produced a GDP 1/2 of last cycle on housing/auto production # at every prior recession low. WTF JY. High stock prices is not an economy. ZIRP and QE/debts will destroy us. What a mental moron.
906 2018-12-20 20:30:35 Well, he and his cronies and foreign investors can gobble up stocks easier when they cost less. Just putting that out there for anyone who never took econ.

910 2018-12-20 20:29:17 You lost your bump stocks. Your taxes will pay for fetuses to be killed. And you still won’t get a wall. I’m not salty. I’m vindicated in my dissent.

Bump stocks - are u kidding me?
I think they are a joke BUT you want executive order to determine what is legal with regards to 2nd amendment? So what's next, Mag cap, semi auto, etc...
One trigger pull is one trigger pull Bump Stock doesn't change that.
UR WRONG
919 2018-12-20 20:27:12 There is no where in the US you can own any type of gun, or gun product.  In fact, this just changed again with respect to bump stocks.

People in Mass, CA, NY, NJ etc own firearms.  They have much much better outcomes than lax states.  There is no violation.
920 2018-12-20 20:27:07 Thanks for your reassurance I was about to sell all my stocks
921 2018-12-20 20:27:01 Hésite pas si t'as besoin de parler*

*Dans la limite des stocks disponibles avant endormissement
922 2018-12-20 20:26:40 That's still not a very good idea. This could very well be a long term bear market. Like the gold investors have suffered for 8 years. It's like buying gold stocks in 2012
923 2018-12-20 20:26:31 Farmers heading to the welfare line...Trump’s idea of, “winning “. Check your stocks ...worse year in over a decade! #Trumpwouldntrecognizewinningifithithiminhisfatass
924 2018-12-20 20:26:23 Now it gets exciting. Bet stocks go down again.
925 2018-12-20 20:26:22 Not sold on this bill but still researching.  Seems to put a lot on personal discretion which, historically,  is not great for justice.  More upset about banning bump stocks! I will follow order if/when legislation is passed! Not following an EO that infringes on 2nd amendment!
926 2018-12-20 20:26:04 That was quite a reversal in the yield curve.  With economy weakening, buying long end after hawkish Fed doesn’t make sense.  If Fed is stubborn about continued rate hikes, that will crush stocks and the economy, eventually that’s more bullish for 5s than 30s.
927 2018-12-20 20:25:40 @realDonaldTrump "Stocks sank for a second day Thursday after the Federal Reserve raised benchmark interest rates."  Gee thanks Mr. Pres. LMAO

934 2018-12-20 20:23:23 Quantative easing is the reason the fed has been forced to raise rates. What a crock of shit! They printed $4T under Obama to help stimulate the market (fake $ buying stocks) and now it’s “TOO” high bc a POTUS has came in and actually created real jobs, now it’s roaring to hot!

937 2018-12-20 20:22:54 Question for value-based/fundamental investors:

Are any stocks hitting or approaching your price targets? If so, which ones?
938 2018-12-20 20:22:52 Stocks set for worst run in a decade. Money shift has not happened to commodity from equity..yet. Bonds and gold absorbed most of it
939 2018-12-20 20:22:41 say goodbye by to a LOT MORE than bump stocks. Times change. You change with them or they change you. Good day.

945 2018-12-20 20:21:26 In a couple weeks I’ll be turning in all my bump stocks ....
946 2018-12-20 20:20:54 I KNEW bump stocks had an excellent purpose 
947 2018-12-20 20:20:54 People ARE selling their stocks. That's why the market is going down.
948 2018-12-20 20:20:33   You couldn’t even “buy” penny stocks incel.  I find it hilarious that you’re definitely going to die alone with this ideology.
949 2018-12-20 20:20:24 Up until Octobr 15.... Cannabis stocks have lost billions since then.
950 2018-12-20 20:20:20 Btw when your lied to everyday...any boasting, talking up economy, stocks, jobs etc,... people stopped believing and it falls on hallow ears.
951 2018-12-20 20:20:13 "The Dow" In Continuing his trend of everything he touches turns to sh*t, Trump was behind the massive $1.5T #GOPTAXSCAM that only result was massive $1.4T  in Stock Buybacks. And now all those overinflated stocks all lost their value w another Trump Dow Crash 600 today,4K total
952 2018-12-20 20:18:25 If you have stocks you might wait until after Christmas to check the status.  It is depressing to see so much lost!
953 2018-12-20 20:18:10 impacto es más significativo sobre stocks (riqueza) que sobre flujos (ingresos). Gini mide esto último
954 2018-12-20 20:17:45 If people can't handle a downturn in stocks, they shouldn't own them. This will be an opportunity for those who are patient.
955 2018-12-20 20:17:34 It has no real effect? No bump stocks on federal land?
956 2018-12-20 20:17:24 customers fight me when something is out of stock as if i’m the one that physically sits in every aisle and stocks each item like leave me alone .......
957 2018-12-20 20:16:45 The stocks were great til the news of the Democrats taking over the house. 
The Feds raised interest rates 1 time under Obama.
They have raised it 7 times under Trump. So get your facts and point the blame equally.
958 2018-12-20 20:16:41 Because it’s not an argument, it’s a feeling. You are really upset over the banning of bump stocks? And what tyranny? If you think laws are a form of tyranny, then... good luck. You did not once provide any evidence, at all.
959 2018-12-20 20:16:30 You mean the value of his FILM Stocks are going up?

963 2018-12-20 20:15:53 if declines goes that long we'll be at Dow 18,000.....and you'll be talking about job layoffs, order cancellations, unemployment insurance, housing crash......funny how the Fed think stocks mean nothing for US economy in their bs "models".....bitcoin gonna look good again!

966 2018-12-20 20:15:01 What percentage of the new jobs pay living wages?  If you create 200,000/month jobs that pay less then $15.00/hr you haven't accomplished much.  BTW- the stock market is dropping like a rock.  Fortunately, the bottom 50% of the American People don't have any money in stocks.
967 2018-12-20 20:14:56 According to my stocks, I lost over $6000 because they raised the rate. Bastards!!
968 2018-12-20 20:14:38 Hi, thanks for getting in touch. The demand for the Hue outdoor products have exceeded expectations, we are hoping to have stocks replenished soon. We do not have a specific date for this, however keep an eye on our social media channels and website for updates.
969 2018-12-20 20:14:35 Sooo, do I rotate my 401k into stocks now, or...?

972 2018-12-20 20:14:21 not important to close green - several stocks look very interesting for trend reversal even if we just manage to close at current level ..
973 2018-12-20 20:14:15 @digitalassetbuy @LoveForCrypto17 @C3_Nik @CKJCryptonews 
Isn't triple witching day tomorrow. How convenient for stocks to be taking a dive today, Congress to be ruling on the cryptos and for btc and all cryptos to be rebounding.  Alot of money may leave stocks to crypto friday.

977 2018-12-20 20:12:48 What are you two cents on paper stocks?
978 2018-12-20 20:12:41 remember when all the banks and auto companies went to shitter a few years back? or when airline stocks went to hell after 9/11? those kind of companies almost always come back.
979 2018-12-20 20:12:37 @BMileskiKFAN the FED raised interest rates recently do not surprising stocks are taking a hit...

981 2018-12-20 20:12:00 There must be consequences for not paying debts, those who pay must not shoulder the burden for those who can but don’t. I also believe that gamblers (stocks or bank bond holders) shouldn’t be bailed out.
982 2018-12-20 20:11:59 So....Can I guess that you are looking at cyclical stocks, because they have been
 De-Risked and offer a decent Risk vs Reward proposition, as opposed to Big Tech, which in my opinion.... still hasn't been Washed Out yet .... correct ??
983 2018-12-20 20:11:59 This is probably the best time for dollar cost averaging into stocks of you are young
984 2018-12-20 20:11:30 Is well known that you can turn most if not all ARs a into fully auto fairly easily. It's just a simple piece of machined metal inserted into the lower unit.
Big plastic bump stocks are inaccurate and unnecessary. 
This is just pandering to a group without any real meaning.
985 2018-12-20 20:11:26 no. bonds been coming off hard even with stocks weakening

1003 2018-12-20 20:07:51 Well with the government shutdown stocks are probably gonna drop a little more. But the pattern has been stocks go up at the start of the new year, but this is kinda an unprecedented time with everything going on

1022 2018-12-20 20:04:11 Scalise promises Wall funding, stocks bounce
1023 2018-12-20 20:04:00 Just remember this - 84% of stocks are held by 10% of Americans... so, this is mainly rich people selling off high and buying back low to profit billions they sink in their off shore tax havens to keep the money out of the hands of the masses...
1024 2018-12-20 20:03:53 A month ago I advised selling your stocks and buying into silver and gold, today you see why, with AG gaining over 7% while corporate America takes a dump. I do not own AG, I am only an advisor, AG is still worth looking at.
1025 2018-12-20 20:02:45 Most stocks would have fallen months ago if not for being artificially propped up through stock buybacks funded by the tax cuts.  But that was only ever a temporary thing and once that well runs dry, their prices begin to reflect market realities.
1026 2018-12-20 20:02:34 1) looming govt shutdown
2) Fed decision
3) China tension
Its starting to look like there is another destabilizing driver every week. I just started picking up positions for some stocks as i always keep some cash handy.
1027 2018-12-20 20:02:32 Been ramping up my buys of SH over the last month, and also buying OTM PUTs on stocks that suffer greatly in recessions, like RCL. So cheap to do this protection against dividend paying stocks I don't want to sell.

1032 2018-12-20 20:01:24 What's the point I'm trying to make here? This is what sector fund liquidation looks like... $XBI $IBB Retail does not support stocks, insinuations do.. Tax loss selling make it worse.. Now we get to have fun.
1033 2018-12-20 20:01:21 Haven't seen any of your excellent regional mall commentary tweets in awhile....have you seen the prices of the preferred stocks of PEI, CBL, and WPG?  It's a bloodbath.  Trading like all 3 companies are going under.
1034 2018-12-20 20:00:41 Hitting up @TDANetwork to discuss the market sell off in stocks. What should you do? Thoughts coming up in 5 minutes.
1035 2018-12-20 20:00:40 MAGAt's, please cash in your stocks and bonds, 401k,  use you 'petty cash', your holiday spending money, your kids' college tuition, take out Equity loan to fund your leader's Wall. The lib's are loving your efforts!
1036 2018-12-20 20:00:39 It's weird that people rely on employers for training.
Buffet says that the greatest investment you'll ever make is the investment in yourself.
He's right. 
Forget single digit returns on stocks, bonds and property. 
Instead think of yourself as THE cash generating asset.
1037 2018-12-20 20:00:36 #stocks Buy and HOLD? Idiots only need to apply.  "Professional" advice from investment industry?  Common sense suggests: how can a buyer accept advice from a profoundly INTERESTED PARTY???  Ther are shearers, and there are sheep.  Account balances DO NOT LIE!
1038 2018-12-20 19:59:03 Tis true! Stocks and the DXY... may all flip come the new year tho
1039 2018-12-20 19:58:34 4 out of 5 stocks move with the general direction of the market and we're in a downtrend with the Fed in a tightening cycle. These are difficult headwinds to fight right now. #ThursdayThought
1040 2018-12-20 19:58:19 If Trump supporters really want him to succeed they should take their GoFundMe wall money and buy stocks to try and stop the next 550 point Dow Jones freefall - the 21st such drop during his presidency
1041 2018-12-20 19:58:14 Also, happy I transitioned my entire portfolio into longer term weed stocks. I know that’s not the conventional way to handle a portfolio but, I’m young, so oh well. Once I get some real cash rolling I will probably be buying into the other markets. Hopefully it won’t be to late
1042 2018-12-20 19:58:07 First time I’ve seen a downtick in bonds in months. This is important. $tlt $tbt $spy #valueinvestor #stocks
1043 2018-12-20 19:58:01 Most likely, there are some liberals who are heavily invested in the stocks of these EVs.
1044 2018-12-20 19:58:01 The old "what do you need one for" position does not hold water when the repercussions of this action are considered. 

It's about a whole "Lot" more than bump stocks

Virtually all semi autos can be bump fired without a bump stock

Acceptable "rate of fire" to be determined.
1045 2018-12-20 19:57:39 Traders at investment banks have bonus in stocks.
Bonus are locked for 5 years.

This means that a trader will protect himself with Put options, if the market goes lower his bonus doesn't devaluate much.
1046 2018-12-20 19:57:04 We'll know the bear market is over when they start running "The Race to a $100 Billion Valuation" segments on TV... for the same stocks that used to be headed to a trillion! #FAANG $FB $AMZN $NFLX $GOOGL $AAPL

1048 2018-12-20 19:57:01 Broadcasters, news, & experts got to talk about something I guess, because it's too simple to say Fed Res. can't do anything about stock market, & regardless good economy & biz earnings, realization is occurring stocks OVERPRICED @ prices of 40, 30, & 20 yrs in future. That's bad
1049 2018-12-20 19:56:19 BREAKING: Stocks are plunging again on Wall Street, chopping another 600 points off the Dow Jones Industrial average.  by @AP
1050 2018-12-20 19:56:19 It is the other way round though mate . You’re laughing at our Chairman making a total cluster fuck up. Meanwhile you’ve got TWO chairman doing exactly the same and dragging it through court. Truth is we’re both laughing stocks 
1051 2018-12-20 19:56:09 All the money corporations are making off the tax scam will be useful in buying back stocks whose values have sunk 10-25%
1052 2018-12-20 19:56:02 Nike stocks went up the last time y’all boycotted something. See how that works.
1053 2018-12-20 19:55:54 Back then they worried for their lives .. not their Dow Jones stocks.
1054 2018-12-20 19:55:52 @EvanLSolomon buy bank stocks and join a credit union!! #ottnews .. i use BCU on Carling ave
1055 2018-12-20 19:55:39 Thelma came back from lunch today and cheerfully told us that Trump had banned bump stocks.

“However,” she cautioned, “I wouldn’t get too excited.  I think he believes that bump stocks are what’s causing the stock market to crash”.
1056 2018-12-20 19:55:30 Banning bump stocks is not going to change anything.  Mr. President, stand up for the citizens Liberty! #MAGA #BuildTheWall @POTUS #WWG1WGA #WeThePeople @JackPosobiec @charliekirk11 @owenshoyer @Millie__Weaver @realDonaldTrump
1057 2018-12-20 19:55:18 @realDonaldTrump the reason we're having a shutdown is because of poor leadership in the White House. Rather than work with Congress, you want to act immature and demand $$ for a wall. All while stocks are dropping and the economy is beginning to strain.
1058 2018-12-20 19:55:14 You can hop in now but only to short the market. If you’re in it for the long run, don’t buy stocks yet since they’re going to keep dropping to record lows. We could be in for the Great Depression 2
1059 2018-12-20 19:54:55 STFU ABOUT THAT WALL/Stocks R dropping/economy slowing down bc of your Idiocracy that bankrupt U 6times is now hurting Us
1060 2018-12-20 19:54:51 Market gained optimism by looking at flight to quality stocks like $TLRY. 
1061 2018-12-20 19:54:35 @NO_townE UPS stocks hella low right now. Do it.
1062 2018-12-20 19:54:32 modi should sell the country reserves in stocks , repeal IAS , IPS and give the governance  to raghuram rajan, narayanmurthy
1063 2018-12-20 19:54:04 I initiated a starting position in $SYK today at 154.78.  I've wanted to increase Healthcare exposure and especially in this name.  This currently leaves only $MDT as the remaining security I want! #stocks
1064 2018-12-20 19:54:02 Listening to reports of @SenBobCorker laughing about the bind legislators are in thanks to an unchecked #Trump, while stocks plummet and people die at the border makes me ill. You obviously got yours Senator. I hope history forgets you completely. #TrumpShutdown #ShameOnYou
1065 2018-12-20 19:53:54 Where’s @CNBC “Trump effect” logo with The Dow tanking. Or was that just something used at the beginning of @realDonaldTrump term when stocks were building on @BarackObama recovery
1066 2018-12-20 19:53:41 Bringing back bullying = Fortnite & Juul stocks decreasing

think about it
1067 2018-12-20 19:53:39 @insane_stocks 

Yatırımcı arıyorum.
1068 2018-12-20 19:53:39 Banning the mere possession of bump stocks is really overstepping government bounds, so it's curious (yet still unsurprising) that they would be so quiet about that.  Indeed, they've become more and more involved in pandering to Far Right identity politics.
1069 2018-12-20 19:53:19 Didn't you win? Stocks rallying now, Gabe may have to buy the beers.
1070 2018-12-20 19:53:13 Thelma came back from lunch today and cheerfully told us that Trump had banned bump stocks.

“However,” she cautioned, “I wouldn’t get too excited.  I think he believes that bump stocks are what’s causing the stock market to crash”.
1071 2018-12-20 19:53:09 Agree. If you are still investing you can now buy the same stocks cheaper. I know the loss of account value hurts but hang tough it will turn for you especially as young as you are 
1072 2018-12-20 19:53:06 At the very least, this teaches us that our commander in chief should be careful with what he says. Words even without or preceding action, seem to have a strong hold on stocks and their response to the present day.
1073 2018-12-20 19:53:05 What’s really scary is how Trump will make out on this border wall where he will for sure own stocks in the company chosen to build the wall. Once again Trump will profit off of our tax dollars which he has done his entire life! He is a leach on our taxes!
1074 2018-12-20 19:53:02 Trump better stand his ground on this wall and shut down the government over this border crisis, or the American people will impeach him in 2020. Donald Trump has already betrayed America on the second amendment - bump stocks.
1075 2018-12-20 19:53:00 TRUMP DISTRACTION 101
Tuesday - Bump Stocks
Yesterday - Syria Withdrawal

1077 2018-12-20 19:52:26 [looks around to make sure no one’s paying attention and whispers]

I bought stocks today b/c my time horizon is decades not days or weeks
1078 2018-12-20 19:52:22 Stocks rumored to fall on my fantasy performance
1079 2018-12-20 19:52:05 Realmente los bump stocks son para uso recreativo, le quita precisión al arma. Cosas que jamás compraría: bump stock y un Roni. Eso es botar dinero en mi humilde opinion. Por ahí andan muchos molestos con la NRA por ceder ante esto. Por mi que se lo automamen.
1080 2018-12-20 19:51:47 When the stocks crash and the economy nose dives, they'll all be wanting their money back fast!

1086 2018-12-20 19:50:29 Technically same with options on a mark to market basis.
Otherwise, if you only consider terminal payoff at expiry, you can say the same thing for stocks pretending expiry is in 20 years and you capture all divs etc.
1087 2018-12-20 19:50:17 Lindsey is from days of old when we put American Troops  in every country. We didn’t rebuild OUR Roads/Bridges, debt increased still took care of countries to maintain Power. 2008 stocks crashes couldn’t take care of ourselves. We woke up to how broke we were! Thank U Pres Trump
1088 2018-12-20 19:50:10 Wait a minute...I swore you genius predicted 4% growth, skyrocketing stocks, $4K raise for middle class folks....what’s happening now?

1090 2018-12-20 19:49:57 You forgot to mention that wages are stagnant and  corporations are using the cash from the tax scam to buy back their stocks.

1094 2018-12-20 19:49:39 The vast majority of his supporters aren't trading stocks so they probably don't realize what is happening.
1095 2018-12-20 19:49:38 If I had any spare $$$ at all, I'd be buying up cheap stocks.

1099 2018-12-20 19:49:02 @POTUS It is hard to believe one of my favorite presidents, would use one of Obama's tactics which violates the US Constitution to ban bump stocks!
1100 2018-12-20 19:49:01 STOCKS;  tariffs, trade wars, geo-political problems from a divided     international community caused by trump's attacks resulted in global     decline in world wealth:  
China stocks - down 22%   
Europe - down 18%    
Gold - down 4%   
Crypto down 71%

stocks wont like this
1106 2018-12-20 19:48:05 Let us take a billion dollars and distribute it through a population, say 60 million. That’s $16 per head. But because this wealth is actually stocks, shares, capital investment in property, foundations and trusts, you cause the collapse of 613,300’s jobs. (Amazon staff).
1107 2018-12-20 19:47:53 Celebrating stocks tumbling/economy struggles to “own Trump” is one of the more confusing things happening these days... if the market collapses, no one wins here.
1108 2018-12-20 19:47:45 U.S. STOCKS PARE SOME LOSSES, S&P NOW DOWN ABOUT 1.1 PCT

No one cares about bump stocks. 

They’re not a part of the 2nd amendment. They’re a silly toy for wasting ammo.

1118 2018-12-20 19:46:02 Trump wants his wall to built with by a Russian company w Russian steel where he and GOP owns stocks. 
Plus, by lifting the sanctions Trump and his goons will get paid by Russia. They all( +GOP) will share 19% of the profit from Natural Gas sales to Europe
1119 2018-12-20 19:45:54 If it's an actual question: Never try to buy the bottom. Buy when stocks are rising again.
Can't predict bottom
1120 2018-12-20 19:45:50 @WorldOfStu @PatUnleashed @glennbeck so when do we pull an "Elon Musk" and start using our bounce-stocks since bump-stocks are illegal? #namechange
1121 2018-12-20 19:45:44 It might be well with your soul but have u addressed the fundamental problem ? The existing problems can not be solved by a governor using vulgar & uncouth language. A kettle calling the pot black. You all end up being laughing stocks. The whole demolition exercises is a fiasco
1122 2018-12-20 19:45:24 Most people are selling their stocks the only reason I believe the stock market even has an increase is because certain people are hoping to make a buck. Don’t invest in the #stockmarket
1123 2018-12-20 19:45:16 Sure, a lot of profits went away b/c BTC/USD went down relative to my Alt coins. I actually got in when BTC was going down already. However, there is favorable movement in Alt coins relative to stocks (bigger gains). I only put a little in to begin with, but feel confident now.
1124 2018-12-20 19:45:09 stocks still plummeting, interest rates going up, USA looking like idiots for pulling out of Syria prematurely, ALL of donalds business interests under investigation...more people living on the streets... thanks for all the winning. #Sarcasm
1125 2018-12-20 19:44:55 It's an absolute slaughter out there. My TFSA has lost 30% in two weeks. Stay strong #investors, tons of buys out there if you're feeling adventurous. #investing #stocks

1132 2018-12-20 19:43:58 Yeah, but my stocks are tanking now.
1133 2018-12-20 19:43:41 How long before some super-serious economist on Fox blames stocks tanking on investors being worried about Democrats taking over in January? Gotta be soon, right?
1134 2018-12-20 19:43:33 News Flash: stocks and bonds are inversely proportional. Rebalance your portfolio so you don’t take short time hits on long term investments. Place the blame for your 401(k) where it belongs. You will use a mirror to accomplish this.
1135 2018-12-20 19:43:29 $NHPI not a very good day , again, for stocks overall
1136 2018-12-20 19:43:29 You don't think that the rate hike is keeping us from a market crash.  I feel stocks were way overpriced several months ago and I feel if they would have said no rate hikes we would have become over valued again real quick
1137 2018-12-20 19:43:06 I lost so much money with stocks. Jesus
1138 2018-12-20 19:43:01 Hello,

We are pleased to confirm this is not on our out of stocks list and does not look like its being discontinued.

1142 2018-12-20 19:42:40 They do a chocolate lime flavour as well, but I don’t think WR stocks them. 
They’re really lovely. 
1143 2018-12-20 19:42:38 I think it has the same affects. If you look stocks and btc they went down around the same time.
1144 2018-12-20 19:42:18 I can't believe you haven't Awarded the 30th the PUC yet. And nice grab on the bump stocks.
1145 2018-12-20 19:41:43 Gold mining stocks are on the rise. A good time to look at natural resource stocks. It’s still early. Gold moves up with interest rates.
1146 2018-12-20 19:41:34 Correct me, but I don’t think bump stocks were an issue before Vegas. BUT - how & when did they come into play?
1147 2018-12-20 19:41:16 If everyone sold, there is no seller left. But until such is situation is given, observation is the only thing you have to do! Watch price, volume and leading stocks. They lead you to the right side of the market.
1148 2018-12-20 19:41:13 Clarification: Stocks have been taking a hit because of our trade wars and because of fears of a government shutdown. They are generally worse off than they were a year ago, pre-tax cuts, and have been dwindling for months now.
1149 2018-12-20 19:41:12 @FoxBusiness "Shutdown fears hit stocks" ?? Stop your lying. You know it's the phony rate hike.

1152 2018-12-20 19:40:53 Here are four stocks paying 4%+ dividend yields that scored double-digit returns over 30 days ending 12/18: $XPER up 27%, 4.4% yld; $ANF up 14%, 4.3% yld; $RESI up 12%, 6.3% yid, and $BRG up 10%, 6.6% yld.

1154 2018-12-20 19:40:25 So after about 2 years of watching my stocks slowly tick up and now tank over the last month, I am now starting to realize that this may not be the most stable investment strategy.
1155 2018-12-20 19:40:24 It is not about the wall.  It is about the economy: stocks plunging, companies laying off or bankrupting, government shut downs.

Donald and GOP don't care about the middle class, or the Average American who has seen wages flatten, retirements (if they had any) losing money

1158 2018-12-20 19:39:33 This is one of those markets where you either have liquidated longs, or you sit and wait for the stocks that have been holding up well to get piked off, one by one.
1159 2018-12-20 19:39:30 Meanwhile, WaffleHouse stocks up 8000% and Chickfila introducing chicken n pancakes AND waffles. IHOP calls Dick's the NFL.. OHcrap, silent majorityr un this shhh. Sales Sales Sales ... Call espn = ooops misplayed!

1162 2018-12-20 19:38:53 I sold all of my stocks in Nike when they decided to put that ediot on there campaign I didn’t care how much money I lost either because I will never side with a company that disrespects our flag. I also donated all of my Nike clothes and shoes products.
1163 2018-12-20 19:38:43 It usually moves independent of stocks.
1164 2018-12-20 19:38:28 My feelings exactly  all of my handbags have weathered their value more than my stocks have.
1165 2018-12-20 19:38:16  Mexico won't pay through trade... look what Trump's policies have done to stocks!.

Over 90% show up.  This is a violation of 5 USC 3107 to use govt resources for PR
1166 2018-12-20 19:37:41 Maybe not inversely related, but at least crypto is capable of moving independent from stocks.

1168 2018-12-20 19:37:26 We do not view the current budget impasse as systemic risk and believe current sell off represents a capitulation move.

Aggressive traders would look to add to long positions.

1170 2018-12-20 19:37:07 At the market lows $VIX hit 30.30 during the 2-2:30 margin call window.  That seems to have nailed a short term bottom.

1172 2018-12-20 19:36:52 Some Cdn oil stocks will be the buy of the decade now or soon if you have the guts to go in and buy a wide list. A few will fail but a few will be 5-10 baggers.

1189 2018-12-20 19:35:13 Just remember this. December 2008 stocks were under 8000. When Obama left office January 2017 stocks were 19000.  Wonder where they will be when spanky gets impeached. Right now under 23000.
1190 2018-12-20 19:34:24 They’re not. I started selling off my stocks and mutual funds. Time to pay down the mortgage and regroup for the next wave. Happy to sit back and just see what happens for the next little while.
1191 2018-12-20 19:34:02 I thought stocks were plunging in an attempt to reverse Barack Obama’s legacy???
1192 2018-12-20 19:33:47 I am still not convinced bump stocks were used in Vegas.
1193 2018-12-20 19:33:47 Whatever company that designed, made and sold that "dress," I wouldn't be surprised if their stocks plummet.
1194 2018-12-20 19:33:25 $RKDA making a move on volume well abv average. $YTEN sympathy play. Good stocks for January effect.
1195 2018-12-20 19:33:19 So you’re familiar with their tirades? I don’t recall seein y’all on forums before. Either way, hope this play turns out our good for all buying. I just don’t want to risk being stuck holding a bag. If I wanted to do that I’d be trading more big board stocks 
1196 2018-12-20 19:33:17 Just remember this. December 2008 stocks were under 8000. When Obama left office January 2017 stocks were 19000.  Wonder where they will be when spanky gets impeached. Right now under 23000.

1200 2018-12-20 19:32:20 while stocks last on a digital item...thats retarded vernacular
1201 2018-12-20 19:32:09 crude is still crud. It's almost as if stocks were waiting for WTI to close so they could rally
1202 2018-12-20 19:32:04 Nothing should be banned until we find out the truth about what really happened at Las Vegas ......Use real machine guns to kill a bunch of people,  ...Salt the room with bump stocks.... Ban bump stocks..  same old shit..
1203 2018-12-20 19:32:03 Can @BarackObama just tell everyone that it looks like a good time to buy stocks again?
1204 2018-12-20 19:31:39 US economy influences the whole world. Pensions in Denmark are traditionally based on stocks among other assets managed by independent private pension companies. Pretty much every adult in Denmark owns some share of some investment in stocks, even if many don't know or care.
1205 2018-12-20 19:31:35 Worst months for stocks since 2008 and also the worst December since 1931!
1206 2018-12-20 19:31:33 Nobody agrees with politics with anybody anymore, it's why it's called politics and certainly a lot of gun owners are feeling that way about Trump and his ban on bump stocks. Otherwise you don't debate Jim, he's the King of insults and jokes; so you try to stay on his good side.

1209 2018-12-20 19:30:50 Now Fox Business pushing “Shutdown Fears Hit Stocks.” MSM MUST blame President Trump for everything negative. Muted the sound but see no reference to Fed rate increase as possible reason for sell off. HAS to be Trump.

1214 2018-12-20 19:29:46 The best #stocks will correct to their 50 MA. The price can spike trough it, but should not stay below it. Watch for strength!
1215 2018-12-20 19:29:42 having no money to invest in stocks also means you have no money to lose in stocks. it’s a win-win
1216 2018-12-20 19:29:25 Maybe someone smarter than me can explain: Investors make stocks fall because of fears of slow down...doesn't that help cause the slowdown? Seems like a self fulfilling prophecy to me.

1218 2018-12-20 19:29:16 The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 650 points, bringing its two-day declines to more than 900 points and its 5-day losses to more than 1,900 points. The S&P 500 fell 2.4 percent as technology stocks underperformed. The Nasdaq Composite fell 2.6 percent, into bear market

1221 2018-12-20 19:28:53 Why isn't it volatility when stocks go up?
1222 2018-12-20 19:28:47 We’ve been waiting for the palpable fear to come in for a while now.  If this correction has taught us anything, cannot bottom without the fear.  No exception.  Even when stocks fall 35%
1223 2018-12-20 19:28:28 Yeah I was doing that, my main issue was sealing stocks since the character is unedgeguardable, but that's more of a MU problem than the character being busted. Probably a MU I'll be going inkling in going forward
1224 2018-12-20 19:28:27 I want to know who in Trump world is shorting stocks
1225 2018-12-20 19:28:17 US stocks on Pace for WORST year since 2008!!!!!
1226 2018-12-20 19:28:01 Remember: The strongest #stocks will resist the pressure. Look at $EVBG! Yes, it's down 7%, but the RS line is strong and the price is going sideways. In a high volatility situation, 7% up- and downmoves are normal.

1229 2018-12-20 19:27:41 In fact US stock markets have fallen in straight line since that 'expert' on #marian in Sept declared US stocks were not overvalued and everything was going great with US economy

1239 2018-12-20 19:25:27 USA stocks getting absolutely pummelled again - S+P has lost 16% in last 3 months
1240 2018-12-20 19:25:22 And Oil has again done it. Down 5% again!! #OOTT
Stocks are further lower after news that Trump won't sign the stop gap bill. Maybe, this time the stocks are going to show what a shutdown means for sentiment
1241 2018-12-20 19:25:03 Trump didn't ban bump stocks by "executive order". The ATF banned them by reversing an earlier position that bump stocks are accessories not covered by a ban on automatic weapons. True, Obama could have requested ATF reconsider, but until Vegas most people didn't know they exist
1242 2018-12-20 19:24:59 & that gun i got it don’t come in stocks
1243 2018-12-20 19:24:49 Gold catches modest bid as panic sets in for stocks
1244 2018-12-20 19:24:41 David, bump stocks are a cosmetic fix.  NRA doesn't care about 'em much.  It's the big gun manufacturers that need your attention.
I mean, a win is a win, but it's a very small win (so far!!!)
1245 2018-12-20 19:24:23 Course man. Now would be a good time to start saving up. As interest rates rise the stock market is going to fall. Then buy into stocks for super cheap.
1246 2018-12-20 19:24:14 Shhh don’t tell the media that or I’ll have to listen to another CNBC “stocks off lows” talk
1247 2018-12-20 19:24:12 @realDonaldTrump your antics is causing stocks to drop 600 again your Putin’s payback will cost you your freedom your stupid wall does not stop the boats and all other borders to be closed your a fool looking for money for yourself and buddies

1252 2018-12-20 19:23:29 But stocks been going up for years, and CNBC must have been talking records all that time. I don’t get it?
1253 2018-12-20 19:23:27 I'm buying stocks and it really really hurts. It's hard to do, there's so many headlines making it seem like we shouldn't.

For those reasons (and because I have a long timeline) I know it's the right thing to do. @themotleyfool @TMFJMo @DavidGFool #invest #finance
1254 2018-12-20 19:23:18 TWO REASONS ANALYSTS PREDICTING STOCK MARKET CRASH;  1) because trump pissed off foreign countries they do not want to do business with USA   companies 2) Deficit is MASSIVE (interest rates going to rise)   Corporate executives are selling their companies stocks at a record pace.

1258 2018-12-20 19:22:47 Less than 1 hour to go and the DOW is down 600 points and the yield curve is less than 10 basis points.  The Fed better start listening...

1269 2018-12-20 19:20:31 I'm calling this right now, saving it on this tweet:

With stocks plummeting, if Trump decides to holdout in a stand-off, eco will crash.
1270 2018-12-20 19:20:30 Trump was right to ban bump stocks hes doing a good job they are dumb and only suitable for mass murder or unless you cant hit a target which you may aswell just buy an automatic weapon but you cant really and if your that bad youll still miss
1271 2018-12-20 19:20:30 Can't wait for it to drop to 85......stocks have never been so envious....
1272 2018-12-20 19:20:26 Just remind me if there is a big crash in stocks to BUY THE LOWS
1273 2018-12-20 19:20:13 BREAKING: Via @AP #Stocks are plunging again on #WallStreet, chopping another 600 points off the #DowJones Industrial average.
1274 2018-12-20 19:20:13 People need to wake up and realize the media's view the market sleaus goes up and we should buy no matter what does not describe reality.  Elliott waves do.  Top was October.  Heading to 2009 lows. People should sell all stocks, short market and by crypto and silver.  Truth
1275 2018-12-20 19:20:13 I'm liking Charizard so far. He is the best choice for recovery, high percentage stocks, and easier kill power.

Squirtle tends to be the lead but I did see Leffen taking Charizard lead the other day so all of them are equally good but all of them together makes them scary
1276 2018-12-20 19:20:12 Stocks down 8% for 2018....a shutdown will really help Trumps ratings

1286 2018-12-20 19:18:43 There is absolutely no reason to buy stocks at this moment. None. We are in the process of retracing the Trump rally.

1288 2018-12-20 19:18:32 Any good bombshelter stocks ?
1289 2018-12-20 19:18:29 The drop in stocks is due to the feds.  That said, all of us made a ton of money under Trump.  Made back everything I lost under Obama.  Still happy!
1290 2018-12-20 19:18:27 Kass always trying to make it look like he's always right. Only problem is, he's been screaming to buy stocks for the last two months after being short the S&P essentially every week for 8 years. What a tool
1291 2018-12-20 19:18:23 We are in the perfect storm for stocks: #tariffs blowing in from one direction, #interestrates from another and a dark cloud of #political uncertainty.

It's a monster storm.

But even monster storms end.
1292 2018-12-20 19:18:04 Anybody know much about the stock market i wanna invest in stocks with Walgreens
1293 2018-12-20 19:18:01 OMG.....the Gov. is in kaos…. Stocks are tanking....Ann Coulter and The Drugster just shit their pants.... On and On. Are we tired of winning. Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha  Shutter down Donnie. Love it. Thanks Deplorables.
1294 2018-12-20 19:17:53 Hey @realDonaldTrump how about bragging about how great the stock markets are doing? This long into the Obama administration stocks were up over 100% from his inauguration. How you doin'? #stupidpresident #shuttfup
1295 2018-12-20 19:17:43 Really have a nice vacation stocks down shutting down the government giving The Middle East to Russia thanks your doing a great job
1296 2018-12-20 19:17:27 The stock market is plummeting in large part because investors realize we have a reeling president who has no idea what he’s doing. #ThursdayThoughts #stocks
1297 2018-12-20 19:17:21 Time to sell those stocks, folks. Take the small losses now... bigger ones in 2019.
1298 2018-12-20 19:17:18 tbh i don't hodl big portions in crypto and don't have any stocks. so i'm not worried
1299 2018-12-20 19:17:14 50% own zero stocks and a small percentage own most of them.  Won't be a problem for main street until the layoffs hit.
1300 2018-12-20 19:17:13 @npr right now: Stocks slump even more after Paul Ryan (fake fiscal conservative)  talks of meeting with President Trump (bankruptcy expert). @cspanwj
1301 2018-12-20 19:16:57 Personally I do not see how Maxine Waters can affect the economy with just her limited power. I know that is Fox News talking points.  But giving millions to corporations thinking they would stimulate when it gave them power to buy back their own stocks. History repeats.
1302 2018-12-20 19:16:57 Why all stocks do down in a downturn, only the good stocks go up, afterwards.  
Good to remember.
1303 2018-12-20 19:16:54 Checked my stocks. Already in the red $40 ... today is going swell
1304 2018-12-20 19:16:53 It's time to buy stocks.
1305 2018-12-20 19:16:49 @CNN @ABC @NYTIMES @WASHINGTONPOST @MSNBC @CBSNEWS @FOXNEWS @CNBC
@FoxBusiness @BBCWorld @AP @Reuters 
Unless and with hope that the stocks slow their role. The stock market is headed to crash. This is something , the great stock market crash under the Trump Administration.
1306 2018-12-20 19:16:38 They’re probably Short US Stocks !
1307 2018-12-20 19:16:33 @RobinhoodApp can you verify my account already it’s been three days and I want to buy stocks already
1308 2018-12-20 19:16:24 It was once considered insane to buy stocks at 18,000.
1309 2018-12-20 19:16:20 Stocks are down 611 right now. A shutdown would finish trump. The recession is near.
1310 2018-12-20 19:16:12 If the economy is doing so well how come the wealthy that own  most of the US stocks are selling off their stocks?
1311 2018-12-20 19:16:10 GOODBYE 23,000: STOCKS CONTINUE ROUT...
DOW -600...
1312 2018-12-20 19:16:07 The Dow finally entered oversold!!!! #stocks #DowJones
1313 2018-12-20 19:15:59 BUT MY STOCKS WERE PERFECT WHEN I TOOK THEM OFF LAST SEASON SO EHAT THE FUCK
1314 2018-12-20 19:15:55 TRUMP STARTS GOFUNDME FOR STOCKS -- SOURCES
1315 2018-12-20 19:15:38 Like if its not the aftermarkets its the stocks
1316 2018-12-20 19:14:59 That's not what CNBC is saying. They're telling me to buy stocks - all these guys dependent on never ending all-time highs are telling me to buy stocks.  Why should I trust you Jesse when you have no ulterior motive here, and the slick looking guy on CNBC is telling me to get in?
1317 2018-12-20 19:14:43 Dollar, bond yield, and stocks all down...
1318 2018-12-20 19:14:41 It’s a bad day on Wall Street. Stocks are down projecting a possible hard start to 2019. #WallStreet #stocks #wealth #money #politics #TrumpFails #bear
1319 2018-12-20 19:14:41 while trump throws a tantrum stocks are dropping like a rock
1320 2018-12-20 19:14:23 Stocks in free-fall. Last time I checked it was -623. Is the GCR real?
1321 2018-12-20 19:14:04 Wow. Only 14 stocks in the S&P 500 are currently higher. That's it. The big winner? Gold miner Newmont. $NEM up 6%. Can you say run for the hills? #fear
1322 2018-12-20 19:13:55 If I get one more notification about these stocks falling to shit. 
1323 2018-12-20 19:13:43 @RepThomasMassie We don't want compensation for confiscation. We want government to stop passing senseless gun laws on law-abiding people because one person committed a heinous act in which a bump stock may have played a role. Most of us don't own bump stocks & still object.
1324 2018-12-20 19:13:37 $THM up 25% could explode next week

1327 2018-12-20 19:12:54 It still doesn't really point to being the EUs fault though, does it ? the EU is stopping people like this literally depleting the stocks
1328 2018-12-20 19:12:44 Stocks have reached a permanently high plateau.
1329 2018-12-20 19:12:29 I hope you don't reopen again until you re-evaluate your role as a game developer. You are like a resturant and you want to spit in the faces of your patrons? I hope your stocks plummets. Merry christmas to all you self absorbed developers at insomniac.
1330 2018-12-20 19:11:56 Has she already bought stocks? Better stick to her DNA and forget the drugs...
1331 2018-12-20 19:11:43 Dad 2 weeks ago: “Isaac, you need to start thinking about building an investment portfolio for your future”

Me: “ehhhh, we’ll get there when we get there”

Dad today watching the market fall ANOTHER 500 pts: “fuck”

Jokes on you dad. I’m too poor to lose any money in stocks
1332 2018-12-20 19:11:41 I have to be honest despite my disgust with @realDonaldTrump over nearly everything he says and does, I commend him for banning bump stocks and the passage of the bipartisan criminal reform act. Just goes to show you even a broken clock is right twice a day! #2Goodthingsin2Years
1333 2018-12-20 19:11:28 POWELL TO TRASH STOCKS: DROP DEAD

1335 2018-12-20 19:10:58 Stocks rekt, #bitcoin rocks.

But half of you was saying "muh risky assets, they sell them first"...

I wouldn't be surprised if smart people from Wall St. were preparing this escape route (to $btc) during all 2018. New legislation proposal confirms this theory.
1336 2018-12-20 19:10:53 Mean while in #Stocks.... ??? #MerryChristmas anyone?
1337 2018-12-20 19:10:34 Glad I sold my stocks last week 
1338 2018-12-20 19:10:25 My stocks are getting Crushed like everyone’s. But Powell is my hero.
1339 2018-12-20 19:10:19 Some smart gutsy traders I follow, going long stocks here, sincerely best of luck catching the falling knife.
1340 2018-12-20 19:10:06 might be a good time to move stocks over to bonds.
1341 2018-12-20 19:09:55 They denied mu tweet about Trump and bump stocks because it was from personal liberty site.  Gun owners better check out what Trump is about to do, SERIOUS and why twitter won't post the article.
1342 2018-12-20 19:09:43 Buy stocks now/this week
1343 2018-12-20 19:09:42 Stock Market is such a scam. Analysts pump the market to buy-buy-buy then when there is a correction due to negative economic factors, they claim stocks were over valued. Horse manure.
1344 2018-12-20 19:09:38 The Spiv stocks where alive and well prior Twitter and HC. There was other ways to get the word out their. Example newspaper. Plenty of volume and movement.
1345 2018-12-20 19:09:36 Smells like recession in stocks.
1346 2018-12-20 19:09:33 I would rather go with any of the large tech stocks than $FB. The downside risk is unknown.
1347 2018-12-20 19:09:16 I could get whiplash watching my stocks' prices!

1350 2018-12-20 19:08:08 Do you support President Trump’s ban on bump stocks, a gun modification that allows semiautomatic rifles to fire faster?

& look st Israel- after their wall, they have tunnels everywhere!

So, Q is why is it important now? Does anyone financially benefit from contracts?
1356 2018-12-20 19:06:38 @realDonaldTrump Mexico isn't paying for the Wall. North Korea isn't giving up their Nukes. Syria isn't free of ISIS. Stocks are down. Space Force is upWalls are Closing In on You

1358 2018-12-20 19:06:29 FYI: the NRA supported banning bump stocks.
1359 2018-12-20 19:06:03 Except you had nothing to do with the efforts and banning bump-stocks will do nothing regarding gun violence.
1360 2018-12-20 19:05:58 The Fed is an absolute disgrace. How about taking a tactical pause to assess the effects of the decisions? Joke. #stocks #Stockmarket #Equities @jimcramer
1361 2018-12-20 19:05:52 Build the wall if you want but ending catch & release? Totally disagree. Imperative all is done to protect wild migratory fish stocks #barbless
1362 2018-12-20 19:05:39 If bump stocks will shut them up then ban them.
1363 2018-12-20 19:05:22 Boy am I glad I can't afford to own stocks.
1364 2018-12-20 19:05:00 So sad. I'm still hanging onto my Blackberry stocks and btw I still haven't recovered from the loss of the Arrows.
1365 2018-12-20 19:04:46 Hey... Is it a good time to buy stocks?

1368 2018-12-20 19:04:33 jpp @ChocoBonPlan y'en avait 2 en stocks le temps que j'arrive à mon panier et valider elles étaient parties 
1369 2018-12-20 19:04:05 And now we have a government arguing over $5 billion in a budget measured in trillions. I am very confident the stock market is oversold, but in an environment where news is almost constantly negative, it can remain so for quite a while. #stocks
1370 2018-12-20 19:03:18 How come nobody ever points out that stocks have been plummeting ever since the dems took the house?

1374 2018-12-20 19:03:02 $SPY Holding losing stocks not only increases your loss, it stifles clarity needed to make better decisions on new trades. Have an exit plan
1375 2018-12-20 19:02:39 "Stocks" should be worth book value divided by total number of shares outstanding and markets should be only open 20 minutes a day to settle daily NAV (even if equities $ are "forward" 12-18 months, who decided that?)Thats why only behavioral economics/tech-quant analysis matters
1376 2018-12-20 19:02:32 Right now all cash expect for my day trades and I will not hold those
overnight. Take a tax write off on my losers. I may reenter some of those
 in 2019. Penny stocks have been a winner holding for a day or two so
those are an exception. Keep riding those till the wheels fall off
1377 2018-12-20 19:02:29 A regressive tax since 1973. The reasons I voted remain, mostly conservative with a small 'c' protection of small rural communities (CAP), freedom of movement, preserving fishing stocks I remember the Cod War and our decimation of populations. One benefit of leaving please

1391 2018-12-20 19:00:41 Bueno en esta parte, bump stocks. 
1392 2018-12-20 19:00:32 Mad stocks hit their 52 week low this quarter sheesh
1393 2018-12-20 19:00:27 To many personal investments, stocks, shares and properties abroad.. not to mention all the expenses paid junkets on all sides of the House's at risk for objective thought on the country's future.
1394 2018-12-20 19:00:20 Stocks, Dollar and Crude still trending lower and Gold breaking out on the upside. Just as we suggested at the TradersExpo in Vegas. If you were a course student you would have been able to see these trades when they started.
1395 2018-12-20 19:00:11 the NRA didnt give Trump 30M and bump stocks are useless and everyone knows it. if you are happy about bump stocks and think it's progress, you are even dumber than you look. Seriously, are all the dumbest people on twitter your followers?

1399 2018-12-20 18:59:52 Only fools rush to buy stocks
1400 2018-12-20 18:59:48 And by the way Powell is doing the right thing raising rates. Markets (stocks, real estate in particular) have been so artificially inflated that we need to correct to fair value. Short term pain, but long term benefit. Our capital markets are not real
1401 2018-12-20 18:59:39 @DougKass started screaming to buy stocks two months ago in his hedge, that didn't work, so then he screamed he was buying stocks in a "new managed account"(obviously lie) but that didn't work either. Today he was buying with his own money.  next it will be his cousin's account
1402 2018-12-20 18:59:34 Yah our response is going to be better when their stocks TANKS! ENTITL3D DEVELOPERS AT ITS FINEST. IF YOU DONT LIKE IT THEN DONT BUY IT! YAH WE WILL NOT BE BUYING YOUR BORING GAMES. YOU DIDNT EVEN WIN ANY GAME AWARDS LOL LOSERS VS ENTITLED WHO WILL WIN?

1404 2018-12-20 18:59:13 (1/3) Don't Drink the Kool-Aid!
About Kool-Aid: Kool-Aid is the 'drink' by which investors lose their money, much like the drink that Jim Jones 'followers' lost their lives. It is prevalent with stocks having great 'stories' but lacking in strong fundamentals....
1405 2018-12-20 18:58:51 It's good, but I'm a little concerned about the concept of them using it more as a "See? We did a thing!" argument than actual change. Bump stocks are so, so, so novelty... there are so many more reliable and dangerous ways to convert semi to full auto.
1406 2018-12-20 18:58:35 All y’all watching the #NASDAQ #DOW and #SP500 having struggles should take a look at penny stocks like #HEMP #MCOA #MJNA #PNTV #SGMD
1407 2018-12-20 18:58:25 @Nasdaq enters a #bearmarket. #stocks.
1408 2018-12-20 18:58:12 Whew, stocks down 3500 points in ten weeks. If this is winning then you people sure have a weird take on reality.
1409 2018-12-20 18:57:55 Then how to explain NIFTY going down to 10k when DOW was 25000. Was that also rigged. Some stocks may be seen as temporarily disturbed artificially with the help of fake news. But not market as a whole. Though I may be totally wrong. I will #study.
1410 2018-12-20 18:57:29 The Moron-In-Chief decides to Shut down the Government over his Stupid Wall...Stocks Tank 455 pts to year Low
1411 2018-12-20 18:57:19 @lilcharm100 you short stocks?
1412 2018-12-20 18:57:15 Why 2 stocks?
1413 2018-12-20 18:57:04 Everyone is coming around to the idea that the FED will have to step back in at treasury auctions.

Stocks down makes that more true.

Bye bye US capital gains and taxable IRA distribution revenue.
1414 2018-12-20 18:56:16 @TeamCavuto malarkey on trends in stocks the trade systems confusing TECHNICIANS analysis-the reality is CHINESE HAVE HACKED SOME TRADING PLATFORMS! I have been monitoring hacks for years-reported Wiretap CALEA HACK by China w/IPs etc to Gov in 2008-crickets!
1415 2018-12-20 18:56:13 Obama nailed the bottom perfectly there. I'm going to wait for him to say, "Buy stocks" again before I jump in.
1416 2018-12-20 18:56:06 $PYX Not much of a bump going into the the bill signing (kinda as I expected). Maybe gearing up for a red close. Doubt we get a rush of buying into speculative hemp stocks in this market. More likely a slow rise on CBD stocks over coming wks. Watch if $HEMP sells-off into close.
1417 2018-12-20 18:55:59 THE GENIUS OF TRUMP

It's extremely hard for the average person or investor to understand what is happening right now. 

Bear market in stocks?
Here's 2 clues

Trump said he was "playing with house money".
Pence said " Chinas global ambitions must be curtailed"

Truly GENIUS..!!
1418 2018-12-20 18:55:33 @brookskcbsradio Jason some thoughts, SP5 would have 2 fall another 11% to reach 20% which is also where 200 week ma is.  When I became broker in 1985, public wanted 0 stocks after 60’s & 70’s, so if we drop to Bear, this maybe End of public affection 4 stocks started w/ dot com
1419 2018-12-20 18:54:46 Looks like crypto is the new hedge when the stock market goes down. Stocks are going down while crypto is going up.
1420 2018-12-20 18:54:46 maybe he's trying to be like Obama when he said stocks were a buy in March 2009?

1424 2018-12-20 18:53:51 I'm no longer making predictions to this, I'm just watching @emptywheel 's feed and investing in Champagne stocks.  Ms. Wheeler, I have whiskey if you need a good breakfast.  I'm alway prepared.
1425 2018-12-20 18:53:38 Stocks go down bitcoin gold go up least for now
1426 2018-12-20 18:53:36 hmm corporate tax cuts went down the drain in the last month . It was spent on stock buybacks and stocks tank. the money just disappeared .. Capitalists are stupid
1427 2018-12-20 18:53:23 Market is still way above Stiller’s PE. That is why you don’t go all- in. You average into the beaten down stocks.
1428 2018-12-20 18:53:23 The news release should really state that. I frantically dumped all my RavenQuest stocks after seeing that. 
1429 2018-12-20 18:53:16 70% of people who don't own stocks.
1430 2018-12-20 18:53:12 Wondering if you plan on calling fake news as the stocks continue to take a nose dive. All this winning should be making you tired by now.
1431 2018-12-20 18:52:51 Buy dividend paying stocks because the 10 year yield is low!  Hold on, let me subordinate myself and take on 3x the vol!  Hahaha
1432 2018-12-20 18:52:18 Understanding stocks was harder than I thought or I’m just dumb.

1436 2018-12-20 18:52:01 Thanks, man! Waiting for it! It would be great if you could include things like a comparison of commissions when trading e.g. 1000 stocks, quality of executions, quality of trading software, etc. Thanks again.
1437 2018-12-20 18:51:42 At least Boehner had to the decency to just shuffle off and hawk pot stocks.
1438 2018-12-20 18:51:19 Me. Ain’t got no stocks.
1439 2018-12-20 18:50:54 Exactly. It’s good they’re gone (I wonder if they really will be gone but) but this is the GOP & NRA getting away with doing nothing. No major weapons maker makes bump stocks. This is a win win for them. They lose nothing.

1443 2018-12-20 18:50:27 $DJIA update are deep in correction setting lots of new lows when the markets like this only stocks that move are commodities and weed is 1
1444 2018-12-20 18:50:25 No this doesn’t make sense - rich people, like Cramer won when we passed tax bill that favored the 1%.  This has very little impact on regular people, but adversely impacts rich people. He’s just making a car since he’s lost money in stocks.  Jackass.
1445 2018-12-20 18:50:16 can someone do the math - the amount of money corporations gain this year from tax cut in which they used for stock buybacks minus the amount loss in stocks since tax cut was signed
1446 2018-12-20 18:50:16 Tired of these stocks going up and down
1447 2018-12-20 18:49:56 We need to bring back the stocks.
1448 2018-12-20 18:49:55 Bump stocks are not needed for self-defense. It’s that simple. There is no purpose to a bump stock other than increasing the amount of harm you can do.

1450 2018-12-20 18:49:33 Thanks Rich, you converted me with your very eloquent explanation of the Constitutional implications of the Gun Stock Ban. The EO creates a potential slippery slope for the future degradation of the 2nd Ammendment. My attitude before was who cares about Bump stocks.
1451 2018-12-20 18:49:29 Stocks continue to fall. Partly due to Fed Reserve raising interest rates, but more likely over fears of what Pelosi & Democrat House will do to drag America into years of legislative inaction & weaponization of investigatory powers.

1458 2018-12-20 18:47:54 I would love to see the portfolios of the friends and family members of the pro war Congressmen and Senators.
Bet there full stocks such as:
Northrop Grumman, L3, Raytheon, BAE, Lockheed etc etc
1459 2018-12-20 18:47:47 no wasde in 2013- so presume no stocks, area report
1460 2018-12-20 18:47:37 Well who owns the stocks? The corporations with the tax cuts bought them and so did high net worth portfolios.  That was never a question, always the plan.The Fed was always going to raise rates. We've been in a bull market for 10 years, this was bound to happen Trump or Hillary
1461 2018-12-20 18:47:20 Right, but who cares but real killers? Fine let them slowly try to infringe, makes liberal Mama's feel safe I guess. If the battle comes, bump stocks have zero importance

1463 2018-12-20 18:47:08 Social media stocks plummet on this news.
1464 2018-12-20 18:46:59 Mid caps now down ~20% from August highs. Historically inexpensive vs larger stocks
1465 2018-12-20 18:46:08 When I watch guys like this make $$ trading, it just confirms my belief that even the STUPIDEST woman could make more $$ trading than these idiots. Their stupidity is literally the REASON the stock market is melting down. Pushing stocks WAY past sensible pricing due only to hype.
1466 2018-12-20 18:45:38 Lehman week, when stocks rose
1467 2018-12-20 18:45:33 yeah, i was wondering about stocks and acreage
1468 2018-12-20 18:45:24 Might be the best day to go long your fav stocks
1469 2018-12-20 18:45:17 But in all seriousness, I am not just focusing on him out of hate. I abhor 99% of his policies. However, I do give him credit for banning bump stocks and the bipartisan criminal justice reform that was just enacted. Two things out of the rest of what he's done.
1470 2018-12-20 18:45:12 When people are selling stocks below cash value, tells me they're going a bit insane...
1471 2018-12-20 18:45:10 I think the Dow is BIG trouble for Trump. Many of his supporters don't care about the stock market. But many of his lukewarm supporters that own stocks...the almost rich and 401(K) upper middle class...are freaking out.
1472 2018-12-20 18:44:51 always late from today 
@CNBC says Nasdaq now in Bear Market, so be careful, stocks may start going down now :)
1473 2018-12-20 18:44:40 He can ban bump stocks all day and night for all I care, as long as we finally get the hell out of Syria.
1474 2018-12-20 18:44:33 Over 1100 stocks making new lows on the NYSE today.
1475 2018-12-20 18:43:50 The law was supposed to energize the economy, but failed miserably. Stocks should not worth because of s tax cut, but businesses improving their product, not buying back stocks.

1493 2018-12-20 18:41:52 People fall in love with their own logic. They are fairly warned about falling in love with stocks
1494 2018-12-20 18:41:17 Manufacturers should be jumping for joy over this. As long as they are licensed to produce parts/items covered by the NFA they can still produce & sell bump stocks, just like other accessories such as silencers.

Except they will be able to charge a much higher price. More money!
1495 2018-12-20 18:41:13 Aluminum is in NAFTA and the US has to purchase so much per year from Canada.  Now Russia stocks for this Ogliarch's company are soaring?  WTF - who is Putin's Bitch - that would be @realdonaldtrump  -  what does he have on you Donald??? Pee Pee Tapes perhaps?
1496 2018-12-20 18:41:06 @realDonaldTrump Mr Pres, these HFT companies with their algorithms are killing individual investors, Unfair. Fire Fed and Sec, they are ignoring high frqency traders in stock market.  They are killing stocks to a big death.  Listen to @Jim Cramer and Leon Cooperman.  Help!!!
1497 2018-12-20 18:41:05 So the market is in a free fall, the government is about to be shut down, and our enemies know our plans to leave Syria. Trump banned bump stocks & is an unindicted co-conspirator. Who is still polling this guy as favorable?

1500 2018-12-20 18:40:45 Finally, I figured out a the stocks patter in Trump era. Read following carefully.
If in the morning stocks are down — by evening they will go down more
If in the morning stocks are up — by evening they will go down
If in the morning stocks are flat — by evening they will go down
1501 2018-12-20 18:40:21 When all else fails, send Mnuchin and Cooperman out there and pump stocks..  haha Trump is gonna explode at anytime with a cray cray tweet
1502 2018-12-20 18:39:57 @sundarpichai Today i got small idea to improve google much more.There are various product in google but for stocks there is no separate product why can't you create  an app called GOOGLE STOCKS for stocks using persons. It will be much helpful for them to analyse the stocks.
1503 2018-12-20 18:39:44 With the stock market tumbling, many dividend growth stocks are finally on sale. It is tempting to go all in, and perhaps even tap into the emergency fund. However, I know better. It's all about strong cash management.
1504 2018-12-20 18:39:39 Layer in, layer out. That's my buy/sell philosophy. I'm on the bid on several stocks for small quantities.
1505 2018-12-20 18:39:25 some munchkin just said stocks are a tremendous value.  Right.
1506 2018-12-20 18:39:23 What are people using instead of @Yubico Yubikeys these days?  We've now run out of our stock of Yubikey 3 and it seems like a good time to look at other options. Or are there still sensibly priced stocks of Yubikey 3s out there somewhere in the UK? #lazyweb

1508 2018-12-20 18:39:14 I feel like they should add Theta burn to FB common stocks now.   Just because it's so despicable to support Zuckerberg in any way.  Guy deserves ZERO
1509 2018-12-20 18:39:14 I don't care about bump stocks but, I care a lot about the Constitution and the principle. Obama made executive orders fashionable. We need to go back to making them constitutional.
1510 2018-12-20 18:38:12 Merry Christmas from the fed. Stocks tank. 401ks in the toilet. Don’t plan to retire anytime soon. End the fed. Don’t let a private banker control our economy.
1511 2018-12-20 18:37:59 Stocks will be lower tomorrow. Government will be shutdown 
...
1512 2018-12-20 18:37:53 You guys have made change. 1st in your home state you got laws passed. 2nd, across this country you opened people eye's. Bump stocks are now banned. Keep up the good work & stay positive. Thank you & your friends for everything
1513 2018-12-20 18:37:41 @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump Republicans failing us again. OCare, gun confiscation orders, budget, 2A, criminal justice, bump stocks. We didn't vote for gov't, we voted for the wall. #buildthewall #shutitdown
1514 2018-12-20 18:37:41 4,000 points down from yearly high, that’s a nice sell off    Economy still going well, although we hit the best we are going to get.  Classic stocks vs bonds and of course cash going on here.  Cash over bonds short term, but stocks still take the cake long term
1515 2018-12-20 18:37:21 I’m sure the reclassification will be challenged in court, and I’m pretty sure those challenges will fail.

Parts that can convert a firearm into a “machine gun” are already regulated under the NFA. This reclassification just adds bump stocks into that category.
1516 2018-12-20 18:37:07 On the bright side - less money to buy bump stocks and AR-15s.
1517 2018-12-20 18:37:05 Don't forget to sell all of your stocks tomorrow, like everyone else in the world will be doing

1521 2018-12-20 18:35:38 We wouldn't need bump stocks if full auto was INFRINGED on already!!

1523 2018-12-20 18:34:57 early?? LOL. ya think? its always for the "longer term" when you get down 25% plus.  thats what you call having zero discipline. Not that kass even really trades stocks but if he did, it would be zero discipline. He's just here to sell a product, real money pro subscriptions
1524 2018-12-20 18:34:56 I said so earlier, since my stocks are in the red, all 12 of them, things within the market are fucked
1525 2018-12-20 18:34:49 Day like today is good day to look for stocks holding up well while everyone else is selling off. $ATVI for example. When rest of market rebounds, look for big gains on stocks that have been holding up well during turmoil. This is how your long term portfolio can grow quickly.
1526 2018-12-20 18:34:18 People spend too much time thinking about stocks and not enough time thinking about companies.
1527 2018-12-20 18:34:03 The Syria withdrawal is questionable.  When Obama wanted to ban bump stocks Republicans said that he was against the Second Amendment, and McConnell blocked Dem criminal justice reform bill that was better.
1528 2018-12-20 18:33:59 Is always exciting that we can help brokers to be the first mover in the market.

"...market over-reacted to Fed's comments..."
1536 2018-12-20 18:32:46 I have to keep reminding myself to trade stocks between the 30-yard lines, and quit trying to pick perfect bottoms (hasn't worked) so I can fight the temptation from buying this week. Repeat after me; Wait till Jan. You don't need to capture all of the move. Keep bullets in gun.
1537 2018-12-20 18:32:20 I'm so tired of winning, and winning and winning.  I think I'm going to buy some stocks...
1538 2018-12-20 18:32:20 Thankfully, as many of the stats guys reminded us nonstop several months ago, we're right in the midst of a seasonally strong period for stocks.

Just think where we'd be if we were in a seasonally weak period.
1539 2018-12-20 18:32:12 Exactly which principle argues for perpetual war and bump stocks?  Super curious here!
1540 2018-12-20 18:32:07 The big thing is make a list of your fave stocks/companies so in the event you do get some panic washout you pick some off.  Because typically they can happen very fast
1541 2018-12-20 18:32:06 Stocks are falling because everyone at work is on their phones.
1542 2018-12-20 18:31:53 I’m not convinced we’re done quite yet .. I can see markets falling further and therefore either scale in gradually or wait on the sidelines.. premise being wait and one can get quality stocks cheaper
1543 2018-12-20 18:31:39 If the #fed doesn’t think massive wealth destruction leads to less spending, they failed basic economics- #stocks
1544 2018-12-20 18:31:24 In the wake of #FederalReserve Chairman Powell's latest foray into Fedspeak, some perspective:

Over the last 50 years, Fed Days have been generally positive for stocks.

The longest streak of losing Fed Days is Powell's 7 since he took over.  

The WORST Fed Day ever: yesterday.

No

My investment portfolio is amiibos.
1547 2018-12-20 18:31:17 Crypto and Stocks are on sale. Merry Christmas, ya filthy animals :)
1548 2018-12-20 18:31:15 Stocks down lowest in 1 year - but overall still nearly 6,000 higher than any during Hussein days . . .
1549 2018-12-20 18:30:55 rates started going up while Obama was still president and stocks still rose during that time. leave it to trump to crash the markets
1550 2018-12-20 18:30:54 could @elonmusk look in to using $GMO for future space-craft? This reads like a sci-fi origin story for space exploration. #Markets #Stocks #Trading #fiction #SpaceX #Mars2020
1551 2018-12-20 18:30:36 For nine years as stocks levitated, everybody said, "Dude, where's my booming economy?" Now, as stocks are falling, they say, "Dude, where's my recession?" Both are just an illusion with this wacked out CB market.
1552 2018-12-20 18:30:32 One of the best traders I know, a guy that was personally mentored by Minervini before he was famous  -- won't touch commodity stocks for that reason.  And If a guy that good won't do it, what business do I have trying to trade it.
1553 2018-12-20 18:30:19 An American nightmare!  Putin is receiving a gift when our country fails to function.  Stocks are already very low.
1554 2018-12-20 18:30:19 Before trading volatility I used to work at a Long/Short hedge fund and manage money at a family office. While trading options give you the margin of safety to be wrong and still make money. With stocks you start loosing money IMMEDIATELY once you are wrong.
1555 2018-12-20 18:29:06 Banning  bump stocks? If you dont get it you are a part of the problem
#GunReformNow
1556 2018-12-20 18:29:05 Congratulations Donald !!! December 2018 is already the worst december ever on stocks since the Great Depression !!! MAGA !!!
1557 2018-12-20 18:28:55 That just means she wants Congress to pass a law banning bump stocks, as well as a lot of other stuff.
1558 2018-12-20 18:28:28 WEED STOCKSif you had to pick just one, which one would it be. $PSIQ $HIPH $ACB $MCOA $KALY $HEMP OR ?????

1562 2018-12-20 18:27:45 Damn bump stocks. 
1563 2018-12-20 18:27:43 Yes. Some funds r holding this market and feeding FII's. They are happily booking profits for more than a year. They are into only few stocks like Hdfc, Kotak, HUL, Infy ....
1564 2018-12-20 18:27:37 would this be a good time for me to buy some stocks Mr trunp ?? I got to wait for my next well fare check !!  Maga! Usa!! Built the wall!!! !
1565 2018-12-20 18:27:36 Locked in gains on all mj stocks. Going to be a sell on the news since they all ran up so much. Will buy back after they pull back and ride it into January when the law goes live.
1566 2018-12-20 18:27:22 Negative bump stocks are stupid... take them it's nothing compared to what they've been asking for... we'll give you that to shut up for a bit
1567 2018-12-20 18:27:15 @sunriseplc #SRES shareholders need to NB "Historically, these represent among the greatest times in history to buy stocks for the very long term."
Sunrise is not a mining company but an explorer. Development costs come from guess who? Trade, average down and weather the crash
1568 2018-12-20 18:27:00 Well...without bump stocks...
1569 2018-12-20 18:26:53 Bump stocks do not make an an AR15 a weapon capeable of firing automatically. Modifying any weapon to fire automatically makes it an unregistered machine gun and is a felony.
1570 2018-12-20 18:26:49 It's mental, when the market crashes people get nervous. Even when you don't own stocks & you hear recession a light goes off.
1571 2018-12-20 18:26:38 My last comment. I respect short selling. I short stocks too. If you hate $Ziop that’s fine. But rumor disruption is unacceptable. I’ll refer your tweets to my friends at the National Cancer Institute. You should be a social media star.

1573 2018-12-20 18:26:26 There’s more subsidies and tax breaks for corporations than workers. Socialism for corporations is apparently good? Many don’t expand/do research/ hire with the money, they artificially raise stock prices by using this money to buy back stocks!
1574 2018-12-20 18:26:19 This is by far the best and most factual perspective I have seen on sTOCKS
1575 2018-12-20 18:26:11 lol -- it's why I hate gold.   It gets worse, buy a south african or Canadian stock mining stocks go up and then you still get screwed by the exchange rate.
1576 2018-12-20 18:25:54 The NRA opposed bump stocks although Obama legalized it.
1577 2018-12-20 18:25:10 What bump stocks?
1578 2018-12-20 18:25:04 Apparently when physical Gold goes up $GLD the mining stocks tend to go up too $GDX. Who'd thunk that?  Was beginning to wonder
1579 2018-12-20 18:24:41 Less than 1% of Americans owned stocks on Black Tuesday in 1929, so I doubt many people even noticed to be honest.

1585 2018-12-20 18:23:21 Familiarize yourself with the English language. 
Statement doesn't equate automatic fire capability with AR15-styled weapons ..does negate the bad rap of AR15 because of the way they look.
I am not uncertain there are more than 16k automatic weapons. Plus bump-stocks and mods.
1586 2018-12-20 18:23:17 $GLD ripping higher above the 30 week MA on impressive volume today. Most gold and silver stocks are taking above average volume today too.
1587 2018-12-20 18:23:14 Rightly so...the Federal Govt has no constitutional authority to ban bump stocks.
1588 2018-12-20 18:23:12 'Stocks & socks solved!
1589 2018-12-20 18:23:07 On flip side, for those who agree with ultra-conservative #nuclear fuel industry consultants UxC & TradeTech who say that #uranium prices are going far higher in 2019, the opportunity to reinvest Tax Loss Selling cash into unbelievably low priced #uranium #stocks is a gift! 
1590 2018-12-20 18:22:43 A high-profile hedge fund guy said today, "I wish I were a technician." He refers to "technical analysis," which is our specialty, and they only way to catch the start of a significant plunge and sell short. This is a great market for us.. Stocks decline faster than they rise.
1591 2018-12-20 18:22:04 Remember: the market needs downturns as much as your hometown needs rain. Consecutive days when stocks are in free-fall is cleansing & absolutely necessary for the next phase of growth. It's the cycle of investing life. In the long term, there will be far, far more sun than rain.
1592 2018-12-20 18:21:40 Today is the start of some winter sales
Tapi dah dua tahun compare,tak banyak beza pun winter dengan new year sale
One of them are new year sales usually are bulk sales,due to seller wanting to clear their stocks
But prize wise,winter sale wins in most cases

1597 2018-12-20 18:20:51 Get off the drugs cowpoke (Lol, what does that mean anyways literally?).

No way to live man.
1598 2018-12-20 18:20:47 In The Market: One challenge for U.S. #stocks now is that yields on 3-month T-bills (2.39%) and 1-year notes (2.63%) exceed the #sp500 #yield, currently around 2.04%. It would likely take another huge slide before its yield would equal short-term #bonds @USTreasury #dividends

1610 2018-12-20 18:18:25 I'm in cash and looking to buy if we get the panic flush - so far this remains orderly selling. Too many times we didnt sell off hard into the close and get a big gap down at the open - and i mean big. For ex, in 2016 I can remember some stocks were down 10-20% on a 4% gap down
1611 2018-12-20 18:18:21 Private Prison Stocks in his portfolio?
1612 2018-12-20 18:18:02 Bruh, the NRA is on your side. If they weren’t they would’ve made a huge stink about it. Their statement on bump stocks is STILL on their website, it takes just a lil ole google search.

1614 2018-12-20 18:16:46 Can you explain who are the "Bondaleros", and how you see them affecting the stocks?
1615 2018-12-20 18:16:38 It's amazing how some biotech stocks are trading compared to cash today. For example, Jounce (no position and no opinion) reported $217M cash last quarter. Today the market cap is less than $100M.
1616 2018-12-20 18:16:17 Non c'est juste qu'ils ont obligés de brûler leurs stocks de fuel pour ne pas voire leurs budget de fonctionnement amputés déjà bien amputés par ce gouvernement comme les autres du passé!
1617 2018-12-20 18:15:47 This will be a great Christmas for the rich!! They can now also take the tax savings and invest in additional stocks since the stock market drop. Win, win situation... Congratulations !
1618 2018-12-20 18:15:38 How about job u and republicans done with markets. Stocks about to mark worst year for markets since 2008. Obama and dems Fix and republicans mess up. Classic every time
1619 2018-12-20 18:15:36 Just captioned a BNN pundit suggesting that marijuana stocks would one day be as boring as potash, and nobody seemed to notice that this was a terrible pun
1620 2018-12-20 18:15:23 @NRA I am so Disappointed in y’all. You gave up Bump stocks. Where do y’all draw the line? I don’t own or want a Bump stock. But making them illegal is ridiculous

1626 2018-12-20 18:13:54 I guess the saying "stocks take the stairs up and the elevator down" didn't exist before algos.
1627 2018-12-20 18:13:27 Has anyone noticed the stocks about to mark the worst year since 2008. Yes that is right, after Obama and dems fixed the worst economic crisis since Great Depression, republicans come back and mess it up again. Unbelievable!!
1628 2018-12-20 18:13:01 Probably about the same as the tax cut you paid for so that all those rich people could buy back stocks, store them in offshore accounts and pay for their second private jet and third yacht.
1629 2018-12-20 18:12:35 The left doesn't know what bump-stocks are and thinks it's a win: they got something and we didn't get anything.

They're moving on to the next thing, wind in their ignorant sails.
1630 2018-12-20 18:11:59 December has served up an Imperfect storm  with several negative events all occurring simultaneously - "Tariff Man" Trump precipitated worst December in 87 years for US Markets + Tax Loss selling + huge redemption of $URA ETF units accelerating downside in #uranium #stocks.
1631 2018-12-20 18:11:39 Except for the fact that starting a company cannot be done by comity.   The skills and decisions required are too creative.  Only option is to obtain a successful company,  and that can be done thru stocks.  But you are talking about theft by using government authority.
1632 2018-12-20 18:11:01 50% of Americans don't own stocks. lower rates means higher stocks all else equal. the rich people did not win, as the rich own the stocks.
1633 2018-12-20 18:10:58 If you were long certain gold/ silver stocks you'd still be killing it.
1634 2018-12-20 18:10:45 Get this market down enough so the poor people can buy stocks!
1635 2018-12-20 18:10:35 If I recall correctly the right way to go about this is for Congress to pass legislation that gives ATF the authority to ban bump stocks?

1646 2018-12-20 18:08:30 Correct, the fed has no mandate concerning the price of stocks.
1647 2018-12-20 18:07:59 The ONLY GOOD thing I can say about Trump right now is that he’s getting ready to ban bump stocks.
1648 2018-12-20 18:07:45 Coppa, I stand up to bullies like you, Michael Joblin, Mathew Walker, who take it personal when I call out stocks they are on.
I call stocks out on research, but bullies think they are privileged for some reason, & try to intimidate with personal attacks.

1668 2018-12-20 18:04:27 I think you lied about bump stocks and your support for gun owners. If you think this isn’t gonna bite you in the ass, you don’t understand the totality of your base.
1669 2018-12-20 18:04:20 Don’t lecture me about fish stocks. I understand more about that you might think.                     And once you’ve narrowed ‘ALL’ into the fishing industry then you’re losing the argument.

1671 2018-12-20 18:04:10 How many stocks and etfs drop 10% overnight for Rule 201 to kick in. If we wait for $SPY & $QQQ to drop 10% it’s too late!
1672 2018-12-20 18:04:08 Just made some great investments, gonna leave those stocks alone and watch how they accumulate over time. Saving the rest of my money, you should do the same. Market is gonna crash any day now 
1673 2018-12-20 18:03:58 @realDonaldTrump Trump is a f-ing disaster!  Banning bump stocks,  trade wars, pulling out of Syria,  criminal reform,  no Wall we could have gotten all this leftst shit if we elected Crooked! @larryelder @benshapiro @DennisPrager @tedlieu @SenTedCruz #TrumpShutdown @2a #wall
1674 2018-12-20 18:03:54 And in that 1 year stocks are down almost 2% and our debt is growing at near record pace.
1675 2018-12-20 18:03:51 Anyone else see these numbers realistic in the near future for the following weed stocks?

$WEED = in the $33 dollar range
$ACB = in the $5 dollar range
$TGOD = in the $1.82 to $2.00 range

Of course if the gov't rekindles interest by talking abt infused beverages then up they go
1676 2018-12-20 18:03:50 Steel stocks down 6.5%.  $SLX
1677 2018-12-20 18:03:31 Ok. im a conservative.... and i know whag a bump stock is. It has no purpose in hunting, or self defense as it only creates uncontrollable wild fire. The idea is to hit your target to defend or feed yourself. Bump stocks only create danger in a situation that could be controlled.
1678 2018-12-20 18:03:09 Je les ai déjà les stocks.

1680 2018-12-20 18:02:46 Question is when to re-enter? I have already re-entered in the oil stocks now slowly turning redirecting monthly contributions to VINIX.
1681 2018-12-20 18:02:43 What’s the loss in market cap this quarter of the FAANG stocks combined? Comparing that with some country’s GDPs should be interesting!

1684 2018-12-20 18:02:24 We are very close to entering the best buying season for Stocks & ETF's in a long time. Attention Value Buyers-Get Ready for the Big After Christmas Stock Sale! No different than the big sales currently seen at the big Dept Stores.
1685 2018-12-20 18:02:20 EMA is not my Primary tool.
But these work on Nifty very well.
On stocks I haven't tried much. But they do work on stocks as well.
These are basically fibonacci nos.
And hence they work most of the time.
1686 2018-12-20 18:02:06 On fait des stocks pour l’hiver 
1687 2018-12-20 18:02:03 I got the News. NY is  suing the all  retail $WMT $TGT and LaRose. Now they are going down all. Probably $TGT $59.... today sold $63 in the morning. Thanks to stocks volatile. Some couldn't make a penny. Hey Mr yesterday and today good good.
1688 2018-12-20 18:01:59 The NRA’s position was essentially that bump stocks were already banned by existing law and the agency was incorrect to have allowed them in the first place. They further felt new legislation had greater risk of being packed with other anti-gun wishlist items.

Mkt is brutal TY #fed JPowell & @realDonaldTrump (ps where r u Donald-Mkt sucks)
1691 2018-12-20 18:01:13 The day we can find out how much India’s biggest investor LIC has pumped into the market in December 2018 we will have our answer. Pumping 5-7 high weightage stocks.
1692 2018-12-20 18:00:54 Stock Market has taken a beating this month can we just impeach Trump so I can scoop up some new stocks on the low low
1693 2018-12-20 18:00:53 ...

If you can ban Bumper-Stocks, you can ban ANY Semi, because all you need to make it "Full-Auto" is a rubber-band!!!

...
1694 2018-12-20 18:00:51 Stocks are waaaaay down
1695 2018-12-20 18:00:34 Only way that happens is if trump squashes the shutdown, which I would guess he will. Cares more about stocks than a wall (for now)

1700 2018-12-20 18:00:03 No reason fundamentally stocks should be correcting like this
1701 2018-12-20 18:00:02 We follow #cannabis #stocks which trade on the #TSX, #TSXv and the #CSE - $GTEC, $TGIF, $GABY, $MMJ, $PYX, $OGI, $WEED, $PUF, $NGW, $HUGE

1703 2018-12-20 17:59:53 Nobody wanted bump stocks. THey are stupid. if you wanted to, you could do the same thing with a string in about a minute and a half.
1704 2018-12-20 17:59:48 Are you proud of what our President is doing? Are you questioning any of what happened to N.Korea de-Nuke deal?Question Syria and Putin approval?  Saudi’s Torture/Murder? Stocks? His ever changing words? 2 yrs with GOP got Kavenaugh and tried for nothing more..Budget? Thoughts?
1705 2018-12-20 17:59:30 What's the difference? Stocks only pumped like mad because interest is low. AAPL dropped more than 30% this quarter. It's the same greed and fear in all markets.
1706 2018-12-20 17:59:25 Why are people so secretive about sharing their stocks?
1707 2018-12-20 17:59:00 No ur right May + DUP = clear majority. Corbyn ,minority and no power.
Conclusion it all Corbyn's fault. There's no other explanation is there?
Keep taking the meds while stocks last!
1708 2018-12-20 17:58:37 About time bump stocks become banned
1709 2018-12-20 17:58:18 Confianza? Sí. Pero también componentes de fly to liquidity out of bonds & stocks. Mixed signal
1710 2018-12-20 17:58:04 Then, shall we let them rot in in a cell for a time or throw them in the stocks?
1711 2018-12-20 17:57:45 The stock market has been crashing over the last few weeks. It’s going to eventually go back up though. I think it’s going to continue to go down until new year. So I’m going to wait patiently before I invest in new stocks.
1712 2018-12-20 17:57:38 F     B  stocks still dropping steadily
1713 2018-12-20 17:57:18 but i’m pretty sure this guy was pumping stocks at the highs  $BX anyone? unusual call buying at 35

1716 2018-12-20 17:57:03 Hey I forgot to grab this but big ups to the federal government for banning bump stocks.

I talk a lot of shit but gotta celebrate the good when it (rarely) happens!
1717 2018-12-20 17:57:02 Increadible...$MSFT dipped 2 the $98 dollar range today.  Talk about the air coming out of the market is right.  Good time to sit and let stocks come in to your X mas wish list price targets...Remember, you will make a lot of money in the future as stocks go up over the long term
1718 2018-12-20 17:56:56 my buying of 2 stocks this week is proving to be untimely $SNDR $HAL
1719 2018-12-20 17:56:01 Again, that's not how the law works. Pretty sure, given some videos I saw of bump stocks in use, that that's not how bump stocks work, either. The mechanism is unchanged by a bump stock, therefore it's still 1 bullet per trigger-pull. Ergo, it's still not full-auto.
1720 2018-12-20 17:55:26 Facebook stocks are not free falling, just being adjusted to their real values 
1721 2018-12-20 17:55:26 Not bump stocks. There was a belt- fed weapon in use that night

1723 2018-12-20 17:55:07 Agreed, but bad week, prison reform was not good, banned bump stocks for no real good reasons, now backing down from wall, like we will have a easier time later. The wall is looking more like a “read my lips, no new taxes” moment!!!
1724 2018-12-20 17:55:07 yeah it's a nice addition in ultimate.  Stamina with stocks are allowed in arenas
1725 2018-12-20 17:55:04 @jimcramer do you think we can buy stocks today, 18 months law??
1726 2018-12-20 17:55:02 @CNBC So long term(30+years) US stocks will always pay off! But we only hear people complaining about market volatility when the market is going down!  Why not question a 1000 point gap up on the Dow at the open?????
1727 2018-12-20 17:55:00 What possible reason is there for Trump to ban bump stocks instead of Congress doing it?  Leaving such things up to whoever the current AG is doesn't seem at all like "government of laws, not men".
1728 2018-12-20 17:54:25 @Varneyco I hear you questioning the December market collapse but I've never heard you comment on the RMD. What is the impact of those of us over 70-1/2 that are forced to sell $10,000's of dollars worth of stocks from our 401K and IRA accounts in a falling market?
1729 2018-12-20 17:54:06 Il rapporte un taux de fraude de 10% (qui est exagéré) au stocks de NIR délivrés à l'époque par le bureau Sandia (qui immatricule les personnes nées à l'étranger.) Les 7000 €, c'est en gros le volume de prestations versé par an et par français.
1730 2018-12-20 17:53:54 @HalftimeReport Blah Blah, telling me why something happened "yesterday" has "no value" today, you all have been recommending stocks EVERY day, so none of you saw this coming
1731 2018-12-20 17:53:44 Regular trading of stocks is trade date is what is used for tax purposes. Surprised  there’s confusion.
1732 2018-12-20 17:53:43 You mean come home and regroup to go back. They will reconstitute and the dems won't let you live it down. It will become your legacy / not jobs, stocks or economy. Should reconsider / please.
1733 2018-12-20 17:53:41 Single stock will still b assessed 2 MSY  <> ranges. Mngt  of a group of stocks in a fishery using <> MSY  ranges. Buffer quotas can B used 4 variety  of uses: >qt landings, BC % 4 catches in pelagic/shrimp  fisheries, BC % in seasonal fisheries. BIG ? is where 2 take buffer from
1734 2018-12-20 17:53:31 But Trump solved it by banning bump stocks over a year after the Vegas massacre!
1735 2018-12-20 17:53:26 Not a good day for stocks  my portfolio took a shit on me today.
1736 2018-12-20 17:53:23 How come nobody ever wants to institute the uptick rule when stocks are going up every day?

This Cooperman guy is a crybaby.
1737 2018-12-20 17:53:15 Thanks Tim! 
1738 2018-12-20 17:52:59 Almost 60% of americans own stocks.
What would you do if suddenly, in less than 2 months, your holdings lost, ON AVERAGE, 20% of the value?
It's completely different from Brazil. They have all sorts of instruments (ETP's) to go in and out and their stakes are higher.
1739 2018-12-20 17:52:36 Can you imagine Congress passing a law that says you can Never criticize Russia or you will be jailed...  Or China or Japan or UK or Saudi Arabia...

She was fired the same day bump stocks were taken away...

Coincidence?
1740 2018-12-20 17:52:29 The quota system, just go on the CFP website, is based on fishing stocks and the amount of fish in the sea, see previous post on the north Atlantic side where UK gets 80% of the haddock and cod, the French get the English channel catch etc
1741 2018-12-20 17:51:33 Monumental in the fact this government is a disgrace you mean? I hope so, and still we are no clearer on where this country is headed, let’s rejoice in the fact we are laughing stocks of Europe

1748 2018-12-20 17:49:45 Metro will use a downturn in stocks to justify an attack on 689 pensions in the 2020 negotiations. Be strike ready
1749 2018-12-20 17:49:44 Sure looks like my trading range is wrong. I’m sticking to it and backing that up by getting longer here at S&P 2473. One thing I promise you guys is if I say something and I’m wrong, I will lose money. I have skin in the game unlike a lot of the talking heads out there. #stocks
1750 2018-12-20 17:49:00 I thought about it, but I’ve got nothing to steal. No bank account. No stocks. No computers. No credit cards. So, I’ll stay with it. For now.
1751 2018-12-20 17:48:50 Credit spreads have been widening since March.  TIPS break-evens have been collapsing for 2-months after going sideways all summer.  Oil is collapsing.  Curve shows a bit of inversion.  Stocks - better late than never - are acting very badly.  If it isn't a recession, it's close.
1752 2018-12-20 17:48:45 Made 10% back on my stocks today 
1753 2018-12-20 17:48:43 A little at this point and should get a good pullback whenever stocks decide to put in a relief rally but I'm just holding this as a swing trade and I'm bullish on it unless it fails hard back into that wedge
1754 2018-12-20 17:48:36 Today smokes eat without huggies stocks !
1755 2018-12-20 17:48:06 Wealth is not necessarily earned. That’s plainly a false statement. Many people are born rich, and they literally do have “money trees” in the form of stocks and trust funds. 

Continue believing that the rich will help you while they are actually the ones screwing you.
1756 2018-12-20 17:48:05 @markminervini so, I’ve now developed the “sit-out power” you refer to in your books and have been on average < 25% invested since October (100% cash now). Do you have any advice for 401k’s in these tough times? Is it really enough to just bear the drawdown? 27yo and 100% stocks
1757 2018-12-20 17:48:00 I guess it would come down to if congress has the power to pass a new law that bans bump stocks, instead of trying to redefine one that already exists
1758 2018-12-20 17:47:50 Awh thank you, we just drove back home cuz we were on an easyJet flight and we've got a rescheduled one hopefully for tomorrow but it's not looking promising at all :((( - Whoever catches the culprit, pls put them in wooden stocks so ppl can throw tomatoes at them.

1760 2018-12-20 17:47:22 back to bishan tmr and the first thing that i will face are the stocks coming rip
1761 2018-12-20 17:47:17 @BobPisani regarding your talk with the SEC and short selling.  Shorting promotes liquidity. Think of Pair Trade.  I stock will trade in a group of stocks in same sector #ShortSale just one example. @CNBC
1762 2018-12-20 17:46:55 Theses stocks crazy,insane glad I didn’t invest in any of these god darn stocks today
1763 2018-12-20 17:46:54 Very good call 
Companies w/ cash due to tax release / reduction are going to buyback stocks to hold in house. 
But what about sellers? Where their money goes to??
1764 2018-12-20 17:46:42 Okay thank you for clarifying that makes much more sense. Honestly i think there is an argument on each side that makes sense. Yes bump stocks are not listed, so they shouldnt be covered under the second amendment, but at the same time they are a firearm accessory
1765 2018-12-20 17:46:37 Idk but I think that world series performance kinda hurt his stocks tho. 
1766 2018-12-20 17:46:36 So you run through your books as fast as through your tea stocks 
1767 2018-12-20 17:46:22 If you’re gonna bash, bash i don’t give a shit. But don’t act like you’re the savior of Penny Stocks when just yesterday the same stock you’re warning people about today hit your “first” target yesterday. My trading history and portfolio balance speaks for itself.
1768 2018-12-20 17:45:56 Personally I hate bump stocks but our government should have no say in what firearms natural born citizens own
1769 2018-12-20 17:45:27 I am a big fan  - but isn't that similar to someone who runs a short fund and is always surprised at how high stocks go ...

1774 2018-12-20 17:44:33 Cooperman bitching abt algos making markets too volatile up or down but of course never a word when stocks were on the relentless bull move and ignoring of course a 500 point Dow move now is not what it was when the index was under 10K-HFT exchange proximity is a fair complaint!
1775 2018-12-20 17:43:56 Trump administration moves to ban sale of bump stocks, make possession illegal by March  BETTER HURRY UP AND PICK ONE UP BEFORE MARCH !!!
1776 2018-12-20 17:43:10 Many other industries have been in deep correction for long time , many are all time low industrial, REITS , and many more . Please stop considering FANG stocks as too important. All customers of this companies are teenagers , lazy people or people looking to kill time.

1778 2018-12-20 17:42:42 Stocks are falling because this is how the market is reacting to Powell's idiocy.
1779 2018-12-20 17:42:37 The stock market is booming? What a fucking joke. The average American doesn’t own stocks. The rest got wiped in 2009. Trickle down is a lie. Everything good that came out of this country following the Great Depression was FDR. And nearly everything he achieved has been undone.
1780 2018-12-20 17:42:18 A quick perusal of what's green/flat in the @MarketSmith Growth 250 turns up a plethora of Utility-Electric Power, REITs, and Food-Confectionary/Packaged stocks. Fear has finally reared its ugly head. Welcome to the land of margin calls/forced selling.
1781 2018-12-20 17:42:00 @BobPisani @petenajarian Does your guest just chalk it up to a coincidence that the SEC removed the Uptick Rule and the Financial Crisis occurs the next year  with a 50% drop in stocks? Nonsense.
1782 2018-12-20 17:41:50 The top five stocks higher at noon today are $NEM, $HCP, $SCG, $PPL, and $D
1783 2018-12-20 17:41:46 Only worse. Bump stocks rely on the motion of the weapon (including the muzzle” to work. If you tried to “hold down” the muzzle as you would with a full auto weapon, a bump stock wouldn’t work.
1784 2018-12-20 17:41:45 The NASD OTC Market closed today Thursday, 20 December on a positive note, as NASD USI and Market Capitalisation appreciated by 0.22% to close at 711.01 points and ₦494.18 billion respectively.

1785 2018-12-20 17:41:38 Then in “your teams” world everyone is armed, everywhere... go to elementary school, go out to eat, go see a show..fully armed. Is everyone trained on your team? Trained to not kill innocents downrange during high stress engagements? Bump stocks are unnecessary! No slippery slope
1786 2018-12-20 17:40:56 Now Leon is bitching about machines. he wasn't complaining when they were moving stocks higher. What a bunch of babies.

1788 2018-12-20 17:40:46 YES! Let's talk about this massive cover up please! You would think the gun-hating left would be using the Vegas massacre as a prime example of why bump stocks should be banned, yet... crickets.
1789 2018-12-20 17:40:30 Sure. So, dems hate trump so bad theyd strike down anything he does, no matter if they agree or not?

1797 2018-12-20 17:39:45 student loans for pot stocks. haha. clever.
1798 2018-12-20 17:39:43 Why is bump stocks a good thing.  Will it help you protect your family or kill a deer
1799 2018-12-20 17:39:24 I always wonder who’s dumping stocks this is when I like to buy.  May change my tune in 20 yrs though.

1801 2018-12-20 17:39:03 I'm speaking to York University finance students today about investing. The question on all of the students' minds: where is the bottom for Canadian pot stocks & should we use OSAP (govt student loan) money to fund some investments?
1802 2018-12-20 17:39:02 What is Capstone?  the Economics project we had to do taught us a lot. He gave us a certain amount to invest in like 5/10 different stocks and we had to keep up with the stock market ourself for like 6 weeks and document our losses and gains at the end.
1803 2018-12-20 17:38:59 Stocks from parastetals can they raise 10billion?
1804 2018-12-20 17:38:54 looks for stocks that are the most shorted....just saying
1805 2018-12-20 17:38:48 Best remedy for low prices is low price. 

Market is bottoming short term. After -15% (and -50/70% on some stocks) in less than 2 months, buyers are back.

If the potential sp500 low target is 2400, r/r starts favouring the upside.
1806 2018-12-20 17:38:44 Stocks are way out of line with risky debt at this point.
1807 2018-12-20 17:38:34 ? - on an oversold bounce play, trade the indexes not individual stocks.  The returns are better without the systemic risk.   $TNA can be a +30% move.

1812 2018-12-20 17:37:58 I became a teacher in America and been doing it since after 9/11. I’m thinking now that I may have made the wrong career choice.  I’m working class that came into a few 1000. So I placed some in stocks. I can hold without fear of going broke, but I hate that my wages are flat.
1813 2018-12-20 17:37:47 market crashes every 8-10 years... the last crash was 08. timings about right... cash is gonna be king for the next 2 years or so. i can't touch my stocks though smhhhh a nigga is bleeding

1816 2018-12-20 17:36:37 I guess close your eyes and slowly buy some stocks. Nothing goes down forever. But I can’t give advice just my gut feel.
1817 2018-12-20 17:36:30 A lot of that is done with regulation, and perfectly legal. In this case several of the suits say the AFT changed the definition it used.  You know the stocks were reviewed under Obama and ruled not a machine gun right?
1818 2018-12-20 17:36:23 Thank  you for banning bump stocks and leading for sentencing reform.
1819 2018-12-20 17:36:13 Congratulations @AMD on your addition to the NASDAQ-100! $AMD #Stocks  keep up the fantastic work!
1820 2018-12-20 17:35:52 you lost all credit when you banmed bump stocks. get off twitter and do something worth a shit
1821 2018-12-20 17:35:44 I might add a few videos to both to show how to find the bearish stocks on my scanner. Also what I’m looking for to trade them. I just have to get caught up on everything else lol. If you have any questions hit me up.
1822 2018-12-20 17:35:42 $study Market is getting pretty oversold.  To play  countertrend bounce play, (if you're going to), it's best to do so with something like $TNA or $TQQQ rather than individual stocks.  -- it's a get in and get out trade.  For me, meh I've got better things to do.

1834 2018-12-20 17:33:35 @StockTwits Trump created a great one year corp growth. Institutions ran stocks to unrealistic heights … All this is , is correcting the foolish over-valuation and Fear pushing the correction to undervaluation. Margin calls
likely on the table.... CASH is KING.....
1835 2018-12-20 17:33:28 Too many stocks probably although my biggest positions account for a much higher % of total. Very heavy on oils so obvs the 30+% fall in oil price alongside everything else hasn't helped. Probably have 30 stocks.

1850 2018-12-20 17:29:17 Gotcha.  In theory, as US fiscal problems neared (which weaker stocks accelerates), long end should stop reacting to deflationary pressures like it "should" (whatever that means.)

1856 2018-12-20 17:28:10 Not a bad thing unless you need to sell today. You get more shares when prices decline and dividends are reinvested. Stocks on sale today.
1857 2018-12-20 17:28:02 World equities refer that global integration, debt dependency and personal leverage have already hit dangerous levels.

1886 2018-12-20 17:21:38 Lololol banning bump stocks is not regulating guns or restricting access to guns. Don’t be ridiculous. Plus I’ve read that semi-automatic fire is more accurate.
1887 2018-12-20 17:21:26 We have to go back to seeing human cost as being a tragedy not a statistic--while monetary losses are mourned.

On that topic, how's the stock market today?

1891 2018-12-20 17:20:55 This isn't about bump stocks. It's about the DOJ and ATF trying to circumvent the Constitution by policy via Executive Order.
If this stands maybe the next idiot sitting in the Whitehouse tries to ban semi-autos.
This IS the slippery slope we all feared and are fighting against.

1899 2018-12-20 17:19:58 Don’t be complacent, because bump stocks may not effect you
It is not just about bump stocks. Don’t wait till something effects you personally, to get involved. 
It will be too late.
Read the red flag articles, read what was passed with the bump stock ban.
1900 2018-12-20 17:19:54 It's all of a piece- stocks & the economy. The global econ is slowing & the trade war is unresolved. Along comes Powell & says 3 more rate increases. Even if he wants that, it ws boneheaded to say it publicly in this environment.  If stocks crash it will b abt stocks, but 2 late.
1901 2018-12-20 17:19:44 $VIX is approaching 30.  That could be the technical trigger point for a rally once this afternoon's margin calls are finished.  We'll see.  #Trading #stocks #Futures $TLT $ZN $TNX $ZB $TYX $NQ $NQ_F $ES $ES_F
1902 2018-12-20 17:19:39 Certainly, @realDonaldTrump has no cohesive economic policy. His spending and tax cuts reflect no particular vision of management philosophy, BUT #WallStreet has been running up the score on the small investor suckers for two years. In real terms, stocks were BROADLY overvalued.
1903 2018-12-20 17:19:28 Well that was fast...there goes the 2500 level on the s&p500 and as long as it fails to close above it, this market will continue to head lower. Time to start picking value stocks and setting greedy entry levels... $Spx $fed $stocks

1906 2018-12-20 17:19:17 I am not an expert when it comes to financial markets, but I don't think it is a good thing when stocks hit their low point of the year at the end of the year.  Trump wanted credit for the market in 2017 -- he should also get credit for 2018.  Dow is down over 13% from its high.

1909 2018-12-20 17:18:24 if after the 200-day crumbles it takes quarters how can you say that 1/n stocks are bottoming
1910 2018-12-20 17:18:22 Still time to pull out that retail IBD 50 list guarantee most of those garbage stocks have another 50% downside mostly bc its all weak hands (public) holding
1911 2018-12-20 17:18:21 RT @zerohedge: Trump's next step may be to order Treasury to buy stocks with executive order:) Heh!
1912 2018-12-20 17:18:18 some of the correlations I would expect aren't there.Normally bonds turn down before stocks do prior to a recession-they haven't,theyve gone up. Also,I would've thought GC would be doing better as a whole for a while now, though maybe it's trying to breakout a bit today finally.

1918 2018-12-20 17:16:54 i got out of apple at the right time but i went on a cruise 2 weeks ago so i couldn't keep up with the market... i'm doin all bad smh. i can cashout like 2 stocks i'm still up on... but i'm only up like $100 on each now smhhhhhhhh
1919 2018-12-20 17:16:52 Hey @realDonaldTrump are you going to ban Bump Stocks for Real Dolls too?  Say it ain't so!
1920 2018-12-20 17:16:16 yeah thats why stockx and these stocks kids suck
1921 2018-12-20 17:16:13 Dow -345 points as Stocks continue their post-Fed slide.
1922 2018-12-20 17:16:09 Most of the stocks are down more than 25%, isn’t that a crash?
1923 2018-12-20 17:16:00 It's time to stop drooling over Trump so much.  Between the senseless act of banning bump stocks, and walking away from ISIS, we need to call him out on his failings.
1924 2018-12-20 17:15:59 His executive order is not law therefore it's basically a suggestion for States to ban bump stocks she didn't really do a damn thing but stroke his own ego
1925 2018-12-20 17:15:54 Mortgage Bonds sliding lower, now flat to negative. Stocks lower. 10-yr yield up to 2.78%. Be on guard for a move lower.
1926 2018-12-20 17:15:50 Every now and then I like to remind:  Wedbush analyst was at $310 PT for $AAPL.  We’re closing in on -50% below that mark. So a double from here by the largest company in history.  “Stocks for the long run.” 
1927 2018-12-20 17:15:23 Markowitz: "I visualized my grief if the stock market went way up and I wasn’t in it — or if it went way down and I was completely in it. So I split my contributions 50/50 between stocks and bonds.” Jason Zweig: Markowitz was “incapable of applying” his theory to his own money.
1928 2018-12-20 17:15:14 Markets Right Now: Stocks sink again on Wall Street
1929 2018-12-20 17:15:11 Stocks open modestly lower.
1930 2018-12-20 17:15:08 Dividend Yield on #WPP up near 7% - like vast majority of Stocks I wouldn't be buying it yet but it's pretty likely this has been really overdone. There's a big shift in Advertising Market but a Company like this has a lot of strengths.
1931 2018-12-20 17:15:03 Really have to go but I had to vent concerning the total betrayal of the President against 2nd Amendment. Some will see this as no big deal because not a lot of people have bump stocks& not a lot of use other than play or illegal use. But liberal dems start that way on everything

1934 2018-12-20 17:14:34 CONGRATS TRUMP. GREAT WORK FOR BANNING THE BUMP STOCKS AND BRINGING TROOPS HOME
1935 2018-12-20 17:14:20 52 week lows for a lot of stocks out there... #lookout
1936 2018-12-20 17:14:19 Yes Sir. Options are derivative financial instruments in the form of contracts. They enable you to take positions in stocks at pre set prices and you make money by profiting in the changing value of those contracts over time.
1937 2018-12-20 17:14:16 So mechanisation instead of traditional  methods are making it unsustainable not just regarding livelihood but also fish stocks.
1938 2018-12-20 17:14:03 From the AFT website "On December 18, 2018, Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker announced that the Department of Justice has amended the regulations of the Bureau of (ATFE), clarifying that bump stocks fall within the definition of “machinegun” under federal law,
1939 2018-12-20 17:14:02 Credit to Trump for bringing some 2,000 troops home. Bring them all home if possible. Credit to Trump for banning bump stocks too. Obama would’ve never done either of these things.
1940 2018-12-20 17:13:20 Aside from my 401k I decided to buy some individual stocks with a fidelity account. Bought Netflix at $420....ouch
1941 2018-12-20 17:13:19 Again, a little simplistic: not taking into account the size of hikes, changes in debt based purchasing, movement of stocks and bonds, etc. plus, in the trade skeptical scenario we’re in currently, a higher US $$ value is imperative? If you’re America first, that’s the 1st step
1942 2018-12-20 17:13:19 First you take our bump stocks, now your gonna take our borders away.  Now we cant defend our selves.  Why did I vote for you?    Fix it, don't sign it !!!!  Fight like the dishonest Dems do !!
1943 2018-12-20 17:13:17 "Legal Abomination" is a good description of what was done. If the DoJ can ban bump stocks this way, they can ban anything they want, just by regulation and changing definitions. Lawless, indeed.
1944 2018-12-20 17:13:16 U make the stocks sucksssss
1945 2018-12-20 17:13:04 Are you guys getting new stocks or something  in May?
1946 2018-12-20 17:12:53 Did Putin tell him to ban bump stocks?
1947 2018-12-20 17:12:50 Stocks were over valued for too long.  With zero rates it was the only place to get a return on investment. With rates now normalized (which was inevitable) u can get 3% from a bank without risk. This is simply a correction. I would argue the Fed raised too much too quickly tho.
1948 2018-12-20 17:12:42 Fair enough ;) I just hate how the market is pulling down our stocks and everything is being capitulated. IBB is at lowest level since beginning of 2017...not 2018, 2017...
1949 2018-12-20 17:12:34 I’m learning my way around stocks. In other businesses I thought evaluations were based off of a few years of operations and no longer projections? Is this true?
1950 2018-12-20 17:12:14 "Just be excited for the chance to buy stocks on sale" he keeps mumbling to himself under his breath. 
1951 2018-12-20 17:12:14 Mike, I appreciate your kind words!  I’m not sure if you know or not but I have a free 8 hour course on how I trade stocks. I’m currently working on a mini series for how I trade Options to tag onto that course. Feel free to check it out in my YouTube channel. Link is in bio!
1952 2018-12-20 17:11:58 1/2
Maybe it is time to order my "DAX 10k" cap.

Jokes aside, as I am sure there are people who hold long positions, stocks or ETFs... And that they are worried now. I was in that position in 2008, and it was a living hell to be trapped on a small long only, non-liquid market.
1953 2018-12-20 17:11:58 I dont give financial advice. Im a trader. I hate all stocks equally. Also, I really dont know your financial situation so I wouldnt even try. If you'd like you can follow along on my daily thread. You may find that helpful.
1954 2018-12-20 17:11:57 4 minutes ago, the Nasdaq officially entered a bear market, down 20.2% from its highs in August. If you're a long-term investor, *right now* is the time to be buying stocks.
1955 2018-12-20 17:11:54 Broad U.S. indices are lower by -11% to -12,5% in the month of Dec. Certainly an uncomfortable ST trend and a bad month for #stocks. Yet, high-yield ("junk") credit and "senior loans" (*note* an area many are wringing their hands over) are down by a more apathetic -3.5% or so.
1956 2018-12-20 17:11:33 So the 1%rs who own 80% of the stocks are 6% less rich. And the government deficit which is a private sector surplus has increased. What’s the problem?
1957 2018-12-20 17:11:27 Could someone ask a Ouija Board if this is a buying opportunity or the start of the Armageddon for stocks?
1958 2018-12-20 17:11:04 This is basically a slow motion crash in $SPY tbh. So many individual stocks have already crashed in the past couple months
1959 2018-12-20 17:10:53 This is the beginning of a bad thing. Bitcoin up 30%. U have no clue old man. Stocks are going down
1960 2018-12-20 17:10:48 #Uranium stocks are not only NOT responding to a 45% rise in the price of their commodity, they are testing/violating support levels. Hope none of you fools are leveraged. This bull is gonna take its time. 

$DNN $NXE $UUUU
1961 2018-12-20 17:10:28 People wanted bump stocks banned but don’t know what they are
1962 2018-12-20 17:10:19 Sounds like the Congress is finally calling Trump on his border wall nonsense. What a mess! Bet that will have stocks closing on the lows.
1963 2018-12-20 17:09:59 magic internet coins are p green/stocks are still dumping 
1964 2018-12-20 17:09:55 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
1965 2018-12-20 17:09:47 This sentence confuses me, if a government passes a law putting some restrictions on fire arms how does that protect bump stocks?
1966 2018-12-20 17:09:44 Stocks are a joke, Wall Street is a joke, Financial “Media” is a joke, DC is a joke.
Oh, and Yellen & Bernanke should rot in jail.
Did I miss anyone?
1967 2018-12-20 17:09:37 Or we can continue to pretend we are pro gun and be scared that a scary black “tactical” looking rifle is any different than any other firearm. Bump stocks were illegally banned. I don’t own one, but I’ll be happy when the ban was overturned as it was illegally done.
1968 2018-12-20 17:09:16 @herecomesthepain u cant make a gen stmtnt on all stocks. but it takes 2 sides. i cant buy if u don't sell.

1970 2018-12-20 17:09:07 How so? Most gun owners dont like bump stocks and only considered it a line in the sand because you and yours keep trying to push for total disarmament. 

PS: If there's a typo you can delete and re-up. Most people understand that kind of thing.
1971 2018-12-20 17:08:32 All news is terrible news at this point. Now they are saying stocks go down due to govt shut down!!!
1972 2018-12-20 17:08:26 Stocks
1973 2018-12-20 17:08:16 Nothing is saving this market... So there is no point in buying stocks
1974 2018-12-20 17:08:01 So many stocks hitting they 52 week lows
1975 2018-12-20 17:07:51 If its private sector pensions they have, then they will be based on investments in stocks and bonds. Its basically paper. The market blows and their pensions blow up with them.
1976 2018-12-20 17:07:32 The fact that it is seemingly inverse to stocks is interesting, but way too early to tell. Seems like a great way to get everyone bullish. But who knows maybe btc will be digital gold
1977 2018-12-20 17:07:29 He ain’t pushing too hard. Caved on wall and gun stocks.
1978 2018-12-20 17:07:16 Yeah, but they are not going to vote for him just because he banned bump stocks. So, all he managed to do is make his base angry at him.
1979 2018-12-20 17:07:14 If you claim credit for markets or some stocks doing well, the day would not be far off for the reverse to happen. Be wise. Take no credit so that you need not accept any blame.
1980 2018-12-20 17:07:06 That’s why you have biotech stocks jumping 4 pts on a 300 share trade 2 minutes after close. The players are getting played and don’t even realize it. Some would say ah it washes out. Maybe before but I have eagle eyes and it has not for 6 months. That 4pt jump has been sticking.
1981 2018-12-20 17:07:00 I was gonna say.. did people become part of some under ground sex market place. Who has stocks on who.  But it is important to stay sexually attracted to your partner in crime.
1982 2018-12-20 17:06:37 There was no big discussion about bump stocks in the news. No calls for legislation concerning bump stocks. Out of the blue the President, with just his signature, BANS a legally purchased item his own, as well as Obama's, BATF said was LEGAL.
1983 2018-12-20 17:06:25 nothing short of a massacre for biotech stocks
1984 2018-12-20 17:06:17 Why?  Lots of stocks are up.  And for those that are down, write covered calls and pocket the premium.
1985 2018-12-20 17:06:15 We caught 4 times as much fish 100 years ago with sailing boats, stocks nearly fished out before we together with our neighbours enforced restrictions, but current enforcement methods are clumsy and we need new technology to avoid catching older female fish as well as small fish.
1986 2018-12-20 17:05:59 Even in the small canteens sir, only one member of the family is allowed to go inside who is holding the canteen card. Now how can an old lady can bring the products on her own? Even full stocks are not available.
1987 2018-12-20 17:05:51 Perfect point you made there. He seems to be either schizophrenic or he knows his blind trust favors buying military complex stocks.

1995 2018-12-20 17:04:43 Comparar stocks da dívida, é como dizer que um suíço médio que deve 1000€, está mais endividado que um timorense médio que deva 800€.
1996 2018-12-20 17:04:38 Hello Mr. President.aybe instead of banning bump stocks, we should ban the meds that the las vegas shooter was using. Or start bringing our troops ho.e so they dont have ptsd. Help lower their suicide rate, which is at least one per day. Why are we in Afghanistan and Iraq?
1997 2018-12-20 17:04:33 Despite its strength, the rostrum is vulnerable to breakage at its base due to sheer forces of water current (or blunt trauma). Many tailwater stocks have a high % of rostrum amputation or injury. This can happen from dam passage

2001 2018-12-20 17:04:10 Do you understand that Congress can and does insider trading? Does she not own stocks? Most of Congress does. Even if that isn't the source of her original wealth, it's how it's maintained.

2003 2018-12-20 17:04:04 I think you need to update what you use as leading indicators to sell stocks. GDP is a lagging indicator. By the time is goes negative it’s time to buy stocks not sell them.
2004 2018-12-20 17:03:57 i don’t get why everyone is so mad about banning bump stocks 

my 76 year old grandfather who owned guns since he was the age of 7 and was a deer hunter disagreed with bump stocks
2005 2018-12-20 17:03:55 Crypto has always been best way to hedge out against another financial crises.

Stocks are melting. Crypto soaring. 

Analyzing the data we know Cryptos are uncorrelated from stock markets.

As shit hits the fan, Crypto is best place to park capital. 

New Internet. New Economy.
2006 2018-12-20 17:03:39 Yes dips will be keeps on coming! 

Traders are only concerned for nifty move! 

Investors are happy to see market at much lower levels! Why because they will get more dips in their powerful stocks so that when market actually rallies after elections, it will multiply more!
2007 2018-12-20 17:03:22 I was about to say, market bottoms when guys give up but don’t blame you, I’m at 40% cash and 25% gold stocks
2008 2018-12-20 17:03:03 Totally right! Nowadays inflation is more dangerous than growth for some countries (including ) stocks could down a bit because they had performed very well for the last several years because of fiscal policies and cheap money. Payback times and generates new opportunities
2009 2018-12-20 17:02:54 The way I see it, there are two things that could change our trajectory:
1. Solid trade deal with China.
2. The "federal" reserve changing its direction/verbiage.

Probability of either happening before mid-January: 1 in 100.

2016 2018-12-20 17:01:56 If I base the rating on what I see my Twitter feed: 1.   From all the negativity, you could easily infer that all the FAANG stocks are suddenly unprofitable and on the verge of bankruptcy.

2026 2018-12-20 17:00:53 You have a right to own the AR. The Constitution does not grant you the right to any sweet modification you can find. Bump stocks serves no logical purpose to anyone. Their purpose is to make an AR style gun practically full auto.  As a gun owner myself, no one needs this.

2028 2018-12-20 17:00:45 Stocks are all about liquidity. The entire ride up from ‘09 is a function of extraordinary liquidity and the suspension of MTM. If the liquidity condition is reversed bye bye *all* the gains. Of course we know that will not be allowed to occur.
2029 2018-12-20 17:00:45 Buyer beware.

Nothing says stocks have to go up over any given period of time, no matter what the mutual fund industry tries to tell you so they can sell you sh^^.
2030 2018-12-20 17:00:43 Stocks are still reeling this morning from the Fed's Announcement yesterday.  They viewed the Fed's comments to be overly Hawkish, or aggressive, given the Global slowdown and inflation appearing to be under control.  MBS is drifting sideways, ranging between +/-3bps.

2041 2018-12-20 17:00:00 Congrats... between you, Ford, Trump in the US and a toss up between who the dumber PM would be (Trudeau vs Sheer) I have been convinced to sell my mutual funds and stocks. Conservatives know how to do one thing... crash the market so they can get rich when it recovers. 
2042 2018-12-20 16:59:59 So money will be leaving stocks and going into commodities when??
2043 2018-12-20 16:59:38 Absolutely!! I was just thinking about tweeting an update with my #hemp stocks that are a little more expensive but you beat me 2 it!! I love $NBEV & $CVSI & have followed both for quite some time.. Thanks:-)
2044 2018-12-20 16:59:15 But stocks moveing ... 
TRUMPISHLY 
lower!
2045 2018-12-20 16:59:10 Seems like high beta stocks getting crushed
2046 2018-12-20 16:58:43 this actually could be a generational buying opportunity in stocks, unlike previously advertised generational buying opportunities
2047 2018-12-20 16:58:35 It's HAPPENING..... 

#stocks money ---->moving to $BTC 

Feel like buying a coffee to celebrate, have not done this since last year.
2048 2018-12-20 16:58:16 Im being facetious. Clearly you are a stock bull. Remember the adage - buy low sell high. Today is NOT low in stocks...
2049 2018-12-20 16:58:14 ...like seeped into our illegal culture of guns, spawning NRA belief that EVERYONE must have assault weapons to protect themselves.

I support the 2A for handguns and long guns like deer rifles.
We do not need bump stocks to protect ourselves, even from home invasion...
2050 2018-12-20 16:58:04 I sincerely hope he's correct. If he isn't, he should be taken to the stocks along with rest of the no deal headbangers.
2051 2018-12-20 16:57:52 I also seeing this.. I think stocks are hitting a floor. Even for the short term.
2052 2018-12-20 16:57:44 Bump stocks do not change the functionality of a weapon. They are a piece of plastic designed to use the recoil of weapon to allow a gun user to pull the trigger. The idea is not why they were banned, but how. An executive action cannot limit a constitutional right.
2053 2018-12-20 16:57:42 I am nibbling at some stocks again into this woosh...
2054 2018-12-20 16:57:41 This is nothing. Stocks could go back to where they were only 2 years ago.
2055 2018-12-20 16:57:32 Exactly. NRA doesn't give a rats about bump stocks and neither does anyone else. If someone wants to do it they will, regardless of any laws. They'll just make them anyway.
2056 2018-12-20 16:57:22 lol muh stocks
2057 2018-12-20 16:57:19 The market is going opposite to my xmas spirit. It is beginning to affect my joy and love this December #stockmarket #stocks #economy #fear #slowdown
2058 2018-12-20 16:57:14 Stocks finish green right?
2059 2018-12-20 16:56:39 Bump stocks are a ripoff anyway,total waste of ammo,and money.
2060 2018-12-20 16:56:25 Funny. Here you are pumping stocks at or near their all time highs, just like Schiff was pumping gold at $1900. Were you pumping stocks in March 2009???
2061 2018-12-20 16:56:22 Buy Canadian Marijuana stocks. I'm sitting w/ investments in tickers NINE, HVT & HIP. My rent will be cleared for over a year in less than twelve months IF I need the funds. More than likely a downpayment on a second home if I wanted 2 mortgages then as I have none. 
Do it.
2062 2018-12-20 16:56:12 so stocks that active managers buy don't go down?
2063 2018-12-20 16:56:08 Left out bump stocks lol
2064 2018-12-20 16:56:07 Gold & Cryptos def have correlation. If Gold starts a massive bull run you can bet Cryptos would pump 100x higher.

The fear on stocks meltdown is setting in. 

Gold is starting to go up.
2065 2018-12-20 16:55:58 @Varneyco your talking GIBBERISH .. ALGORITHMS that BUY and SELL STOCKS that LISTEN to THE news .. these are MANUALLY MANIPULATED that is CRUSHING the stock market PURPOSEFUL .. Profits and ALL OUR WEALTH Be damned ..

2068 2018-12-20 16:55:41 Just sold most of my mutual funds and stocks. We are due for a huge recession and we have fucking morons running Ontario, the US and Canada. Trudeau is a fool, yes, but he will get the boot, and we will be stuck with an even bigger idiot...

2073 2018-12-20 16:55:23 market has concluded that nobody has it's back .. not China, not EU, not Trump admin, not Fed ... so it is going to collapse and go to cash. Makes little sense to risk holding stocks next week
2074 2018-12-20 16:55:22 Dad has still not called me about his stocks. Going to take the afternoon off and spend some cash.
2075 2018-12-20 16:55:21 Stocks are tanking rn. Buy in while you can!
2076 2018-12-20 16:55:13 The National Firearms Act restricts the 2nd ammendment. The AFT in using the act to redefine terms so that bump stocks are now classified as machine guns means they are restricing the 2nd ammendment.

2079 2018-12-20 16:54:36 #FAANG more busted than it ever has been. If $AMZN hits $1427 all 5 stocks will be in their biggest drawdowns since $FB's bottom after the IPO disaster. 

- $NFLX -40%

- $AAPL -32%
- $AMZN -30%
- $GOOGL -21%
2080 2018-12-20 16:54:35 Bump stocks are not required to defend anyone, period. Only harm. Glad someone is banning them. Take a lap.
2081 2018-12-20 16:54:27 enjoying a lot ... I feel bad for people I know who are holding stocks...but I’ve been warning them and preaching crypto to them for well over a year now 
2082 2018-12-20 16:54:20 Que le conviene mas a la NRA, que sea a los bum stocks o que jodan con las AR15s.
2083 2018-12-20 16:54:15 Stocks have to be sold by the 26th in order to settle by the 31st? Is that correct?
2084 2018-12-20 16:54:13 in the short run, stocks are prone to be affected by sentiment, institutional reallocation and speculation. In the long run stocks are affected by earnings and the availability of credit. Every recession since the 70s has had an obvious and compelling reason. Not yet.
2085 2018-12-20 16:54:04 All these Stocks hitting 52 week lows... Yikes.
2086 2018-12-20 16:53:53 Of course they are.  No action was taken to regulate them, and none will be, at least from the Senate.  Too many of those guys own pharmaceutical stocks.

2089 2018-12-20 16:53:26 Bump stocks are a paramilitary "need", not for deer hunting and the protected right to defend ourselves privately.
The emergence of military and paramilitary weapons into the private gun economy is in direct opposition to the need to protect ourselves.

2092 2018-12-20 16:52:52 Optimism doesn’t prevent job losses, plant closings, farm bailouts (caused by tariffs), or greed at the top. Wait til tariffs REALLY kick in! Then we’ll talk “optimism.” Interest up. Stocks down.

2097 2018-12-20 16:52:00 @MAJTOURE like I’ve said before.  For the bump stocks: look to the women. @IvankaTrump & @FLOTUS because with the FL Parkland tragedy as well as the child separation at the border, @POTUS listens to these very important women and the parents of the victims. Convince them, not him

2113 2018-12-20 16:50:07 Morning thought.  

1) While the #crypto rally is great, it's not healthy when the #4 token by size ($BCH) is a complete joke and rallies 150% in 3 days.  Institutional adoption doesn't happen when large-caps trade like penny stocks.
2114 2018-12-20 16:50:04 How about the Super Shady listing of stocks in Germany (not requested by the company) for the purpose of Naked Short Sellers Shorting hard to borrow stocks?

2120 2018-12-20 16:48:42 Lol.  After a 9 years bull run, you are guessing stocks are going into a bear market now. It is way overdue for it.  

History have shown when you hear on CNBC weeks after weeks that new all time high records have been broken, you sell into cash and wait 1.5 years to come back.
2121 2018-12-20 16:48:38 My price alerts on stocks have been going crazy to the point that I am running out of cash to buy bargains in one of my brokerage accounts.  I'm having to be more discerning with my purchases.

2126 2018-12-20 16:47:37 I may be wrong, but could a reason stocks keep selling off be that market is concerned that if POTUS caves on Wall Funding he (and his agenda) will be greatly weakened? I think a veto of the spending bill would show strength on his part and encourage the markets. We shall see.

2139 2018-12-20 16:45:17 The stock market is NOT the economy.  Just one gauge that tends to skew towards the upper 1/3rd of Americans.  I trade alot of stocks.  Lots of $ to be made with volatility and the car business is great.
2140 2018-12-20 16:45:17 We need to stop allowing people that have no knowledge of guns create our gun laws. Banning bump stocks is pointless and won’t solve anything. “High capacity” magazines are no different then reloading a bunch of different times. Stop letting idiot create our gun laws!
2141 2018-12-20 16:45:14 Don't listen to a thing the #talkingheads say. Info CNBC spits out is BS. If you don't think these asshole guests on CNBC are net short or trying to then give your head a shake.  They are trying to pump stocks just like they did in 2015 & 2007. CNBC is criminal to say the least.

2147 2018-12-20 16:44:47 Bump stocks are no more than toys. They do nothing more than ruin the accuracy and reliability of a rifle and are only useful in an ejaculatory sense. Unless your goal is to mow people down at close range. Anyone with knowledge of and respect for a rifle know this.

2159 2018-12-20 16:42:28 You’re delusional.  Stocks are down because the Fed is trying to undermine the presidents accomplishments (Feds appointed by Obama).  Regardless, it’s still higher than at any time during Obama’s reign of mediocrity.  Facts matter.
2160 2018-12-20 16:42:21 In the 6 years since the tragic mass murder at Sandy Hook and all we've accomplished is a ban on bump stocks. That's pathetic. We can and should do so much more. Like address access to mental health services!

2163 2018-12-20 16:42:00 Honestly, surprised the Dow isn’t even lower today, as new shutdown threats loom. Guess maybe there is something to @jimcramer’s point about stocks being oversold, a little.

traders are moving away from risky assets such as stocks and #USD, and are boosting the demand for the safer bets like #YEN, #EURO and #gold. So short $USDJPY and long $EURUSD. #forexsignals #forex #eurusd #usdjpy
2167 2018-12-20 16:41:34 You don’t need bump stocks to bump fire a semi-automatic rifle, mate. This “banning” is an appeasement tactic to give activists a small sense of “victory” so we’ll relent.

DO NOT RELENT. Keep pushing for greater reform. THIS IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH.
2168 2018-12-20 16:41:29 Tuning into this drone thing at Gatwick. I'd be behind bringing back the stocks for the culprits when found. Prize aasholes.
2169 2018-12-20 16:41:21 Well played getting out of stocks 
2170 2018-12-20 16:41:12 One of my stocks hit a 52 week low. I’m trash
2171 2018-12-20 16:41:04 and whats crazy is, Doug kass said to short the S&P about every week since late 2009, he finally covered and went long two months ago right at the top and loaded up on bank stocks. he's been utterly destroyed but if u read his tweets, he never loses. LOL
2172 2018-12-20 16:40:58 "Get one of these free stocks" - gives everyone the dumpster fire that is Sprint. I'm only signing up if I'm guaranteed one free Berkshire Hathaway Stock!
2173 2018-12-20 16:40:39 I recalled Warren Buffet said in his birthday this year...about 2008 crisis was mainly due to people changed their banking and finance...when we move our fund around due to FED...could be the main reason to bring us to another crisis...I like these great American firms stocks.
2174 2018-12-20 16:40:36 The good thing is that BMW stocks parts for models going back decades (at least they do for bikes). A local dealer bough all the parts for a vintage bike and built it. They have a brand new vintage bike with no miles on it. Probably cost a fortune, but seriously cool.
2175 2018-12-20 16:40:10 He’s a dunce, no long term thinking. If he was a trader, he’d be day trading penny stocks using a 1 minute chart.

There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks. (131)
2177 2018-12-20 16:40:01 hey stu varney...there are no reasons to buy stocks and the obvious policy error by moron fed reserve plus the dot plots says sell stocks agressively

2180 2018-12-20 16:39:47 In what society's universe, were bump stocks ever needed for any reason?
2181 2018-12-20 16:38:30 I don’t mean tril necessarily but some most stocks once we really capitulate
2182 2018-12-20 16:38:23 Ever notice on Thursdays and Fridays #stocks get pinned to even numbers that match #Optionstrading it's called #corruption #SEC #FTC are paper tigers ! #CNBC STOP buying options , they're #CROOKS ! #CNBC
2183 2018-12-20 16:38:21 Gas cheap,stocks sharply down, what other great news are there
2184 2018-12-20 16:38:17 They don't sell guns and they are against bump stocks. NRA made a statement after Vegas calling for regulations against bump stocks and similar products
2185 2018-12-20 16:37:57 El mercado está cayendo 200 puntos para el #DowJones continuando con la venta que se dio ayer, luego de la subida de tasas de la #Fed,  La respuesta del mercado es la tercera peor reacción a un anuncio de la FED en su historia.

2187 2018-12-20 16:37:21 Toni's Market Club members, our $FXY gapped nicely higher, today. Please consider raising stop. Nice trade!  #stocks
2188 2018-12-20 16:37:00 Let's see how this weighs on stocks today..not favorable I'm sure, along with all the talk about trumps seat of the pants plan to leave Syria w/out the knowledge & aid & time & allies involvement to make it work...let's instead watch him blame our govt's fed for interest rates
2189 2018-12-20 16:36:46 They don't sell guns and they are against bump stocks.
2190 2018-12-20 16:36:35 so why bank stocks gasping?
2191 2018-12-20 16:36:00 It's nice to have a day where the big dawgs of the gold stocks are moving higher.  Oil is certainly cheap enough.
2192 2018-12-20 16:35:27 Yo Tim u better save the apple stocks
2193 2018-12-20 16:35:15 If you are shorting stocks don’t go on vacation fam. Every day matters when buying puts. #investing #marketcrash #financialfreedom #puts
2194 2018-12-20 16:35:13 But these same ppl sat AR-15 and bump stocks are the same as muskets. 

They read “The Constitution for Right Wing Dummies”
2195 2018-12-20 16:35:08 Update on the smash grind in class, we played roughly 10 games where winner stays in the games we’re 3 stocks (3 lives) and I only dropped one stock out of all ten games needless to say I’m ready for this game when I get it on Christmas 
2196 2018-12-20 16:35:04 I honestly feel so excited for the Dow Jones to collapse to around 18000 , two things will happen

One I will have an opportunity to pick up some good stocks like Amazon apple etc. for really cheap

two my crypto currency holdings are going to go through the roof !!!

#Burn baby
2197 2018-12-20 16:35:02 -Wall not built
-ISIS still at large
-Dow plunges
-Bump stocks banned
-NK still nuclear
-Teriffs caused losses

Trump's had a real good year. #Trump #2018Memory
2198 2018-12-20 16:34:48 @jimcramer  Jim I believe you are wrong saying the poor will be hurt more than the rich. Look at the trillions being lost on the FANG stocks alone.  What about rising interest rates hurting real assets & QT getting rid of money speculating?   Who primarily controls these assets!
2199 2018-12-20 16:34:43 Just bought a small number of Twitter stocks. Just because
2200 2018-12-20 16:34:21 I wasn't making uninformed statements. I never once said AR stood for assault rifle. The NRA had made the tweet referring to the ban on bump stocks, which can only be used on assault type weapons
2201 2018-12-20 16:34:12 @IngrahamAngle #ImagineIfObama had banned bump stocks or passed prison reform. You would be going nuts right now railing against him.
2202 2018-12-20 16:34:09 Was so tempted
2203 2018-12-20 16:33:58 No more stocks d 
2204 2018-12-20 16:33:47 @realDonaldTrump you expect the support from American patriots, yet you ban bump stocks?  The 2A was written to give citizens equal power with gov, so that the people could fight a corrupt gov.  Not only are bump stocks constitutionally protected, but so are full auto weapons.
2205 2018-12-20 16:33:43 Hey Bronni, the closest one that stocks it is Surrey Quays Extra in Surrey Quays Centre. TY - Aileen
2206 2018-12-20 16:33:42 This conversation is about nominal price, not purchasing power. Gold, unlike stocks & bonds, has no impairment risk & its purchasing power vs financial assets rises in deflation, i.e. your gold at $800/oz would buy a lot more than your permanently impaired bonds &/or equities.
2207 2018-12-20 16:33:40 There was a puke in some stocks
2208 2018-12-20 16:33:33 @bbc5live I know it sounds draconian, but it would be fun. When they find the drone dingbats, put them in a set of stocks outside the Airport, let people pelt them with rotten fruit and veg. Saves money on keeping them in a prision; and makes people happy. @RobinRedshanks
2209 2018-12-20 16:33:23 Are they that bothered about bump stocks? surely real guns are heir core business?
2210 2018-12-20 16:33:18 I looked at the underlying stocks n the portfolio and they all look like they have at least 10%+ more downside so I put it on my watch-list. Thanks

2216 2018-12-20 16:32:08 @jimcramer I think you are wrong.  The rich will be hurt more than the poor.  Look at the trillions being lost on the FANG stocks alone.   Look at the prices of real assets.  This is primarily controlled more by the rich than the poor.
2217 2018-12-20 16:31:56 You don’t need bump stocks to hunt.
2218 2018-12-20 16:31:46 What’s the average number of stocks in those ranges?
2219 2018-12-20 16:31:34 You must have rules. Rules for buying. Rules to selling some into strength. Rules for limiting losses. Rules for staying out. Do you?  We teach rules. We "do" rules to make $$$ and keep losses small. #stocks
2220 2018-12-20 16:31:08 Bosnian stocks close up today. I’m not quite that diversified.
2221 2018-12-20 16:30:52 He gave them bump stocks. Should be good for something.
2222 2018-12-20 16:30:47 First a Confession. Twice in my investment  journey, I have messed up big time by getting out of relatively high PE , high ROCE stocks.  The cause - more twitter scrolling than conviction. 1/2
2223 2018-12-20 16:30:26 Note regarding "bump stocks" and other disputed possessions:

 Amendment V

2225 2018-12-20 16:30:02 Since there is no registration of Bump Stocks, how will we know if people turn them in or destroy them?

2227 2018-12-20 16:29:30 The S&P and NASDAQ are also imperfect and only measure stocks which is a horrible way to evaluate a nation's worth, but at least they measure stock values in a rationale and informative way.

2231 2018-12-20 16:28:32 One reason not to get a loan from the Banks. If you want to refinance your home . If you owe more on it then it’s worth . They won’t let you refinance it for lower interest. So let them first pay for the appraisal fees. Then you won’t be out of that  money . STOCKS are DOWN !
2232 2018-12-20 16:28:31 Don't sell stocks unless you are doing so in order to buy back in at a discount.

2236 2018-12-20 16:27:43 Lol who said anything about the Internet or first amendment? And banning bump stocks isn't banning guns. It's banning a gun accessory intended to aid you in accurately pumping out as many rounds per second as you can without a fully automatic gun.

2240 2018-12-20 16:26:39 Most stocks are already in a bear market so why do we have to officially announce sp 500 in one?
2241 2018-12-20 16:26:31 No, the NRA pushed for bump stocks to be regulated before anyone had heard of hogg.

2243 2018-12-20 16:26:11 And depending on day of the week, GS says stocks should be higher, rates lower, valuations higher...blah blah blah.
VIX is more a scam now than ever before, shouldn’t be relied upon more than any other generally broad indicator.
2244 2018-12-20 16:26:09 So ..... If Donald Trump and the rest of his cronies break the government -will the banks tank over? BTW Twitter stocks dropped
2245 2018-12-20 16:26:06 You have a tax break to the super rich - all that does is have very rich people stuff their money out of circulation into the Cayman Islands and buy back shares .  The people then don’t have cash to buy their products so the stocks fall. It’s a sad little rich boys game .

2257 2018-12-20 16:23:46 Volatility is not the stock market's blood pressure. When stocks go down, vol rises. When stocks go up, it fades. It's that simple. Almost all the big moves happen below the 200-DMA.

2261 2018-12-20 16:23:25 Trump is playing Santa Claus to get everybody's mind off of the revelations coming out of the Mueller investigation. Bump stocks outlawed, no wall, surrender in Syria, it's all to get on the Democrats' good side ahead of the impeachment. Pelosi and Schumer rolled him.

2283 2018-12-20 16:18:31 He's playing everyone. He's "trying" (GoA is going to sue) to ban bump stocks, even though his base voted because he wasn't for more gun laws. I was calling his shit back in 2016 and was told to shut up by many on gun forums and shit. Now some are trying to rationalize it.
2284 2018-12-20 16:18:28 Of course you have to have all you said but like it or not immigration has impacted. It's not rocket science to see if you allow all the people in as Labour did then not build as BOTH haven't stocks are low. Only saying one side is the devil is blinkered. It's complicated
2285 2018-12-20 16:18:24 Agree huge snapback coming but my GOD are stocks still too high.
2286 2018-12-20 16:18:17 Trump is going over the line:
-banning bump stocks by presidential degree (wasn't one of the complaints about Obama re: many executive orders?) This should be something that is discussed in Congress.
-withdraw from Syria & announcing it via Twitter & w/o consult of the Pentagon
2287 2018-12-20 16:17:59 It’s not a bubble. We’ve had 35 years of falling bond yields.  Everything - stocks to property- must be repriced at the cost of capital.

Instead of complaining about bubbles, you should be asking why rates have been falling for half a lifetime. The problem is structural.
2288 2018-12-20 16:17:37 As of yesterday's close, there were more S&P 500 stocks 50% below their 52-week high (21) than within 5% of their 52-week high (18).
2289 2018-12-20 16:17:22 S&P 500 now down 4.5% and counting since @TruthGundlach told me on @HalftimeReport that stocks were in a bear market and the Fed shouldn't raise interest rates.

2294 2018-12-20 16:15:34 Seems like it, but how about some respect for career employees who are keeping govt operational and are still taking ethics training and following the rules, including divesting from prohibited stocks; so it seems successful except for those in top leadership.

Good job overall. Want to know what is going to happen with interest rates!!!
My variable interest rate have increased my mortgage rate to a point where it's a struggle to pay. Must stop. Gas prices have gone up, stocks are going down,down, down. Not good.
2305 2018-12-20 16:13:48 honestly its just normal day in crypto, the difference is our assets move where as stocks dont do sweet FA

2312 2018-12-20 16:11:42 Well said Mr. M. for those of us early in our firewalk, still in the accumulation phase, it is great news. Now instead of being depressed about the net worth loss, I am rationally exuberant about the FIRE sale prices as stocks go on sale.

2317 2018-12-20 16:09:34 I wouldn’t touch stocks until $aapl shows life. once those trend lines broke they’ve closed below every day this week. with no news likely to appear during the holidays, unlikely any rally isn’t sold into. ive dumped all my stocks for the year. not riding down a 30% cliff.
2318 2018-12-20 16:09:26 how many times will people online call it a bubble if crypto is STILL here and thriving months and years from today? I'm sure old men will keep a yelling though, like that creature in LOTR, his precious stocks collapsing.
2319 2018-12-20 16:08:55 Don't forget.  They are also participating in a Democratic Socialist Go Fund Me campaign.  If they realized that, they would all take their bump stocks and beat themselves silly.
2320 2018-12-20 16:08:50 Now if ONLY the @NRA actually stood for the 2nd amendment. They seem to sign off on at least half of the goonerment goonsquad restrictions. Bump stocks, prohibited persons, fire rate, background checks - the list goes on and on...
2321 2018-12-20 16:08:40 4 out of 5 stocks move with the general direction of the market and we're in a downtrend with the Fed in a tightening cycle. These are difficult headwinds to fight right now.

2327 2018-12-20 16:07:25 For my cannabis or marijuana gamblers:@Firstrade brokers now has No-fee trades. They also (usually) have decent customer service. This can help on penny stocks #stockmarket #stocktrading #potstocks #cannabisinvesting #marijuanastocks
2328 2018-12-20 16:07:25 .@IEX could be facing some challenges as well because they have to show that their incentives have improved their market "in a meaningful way" i.e., more displayed liquidity. Also, they'll now have 3 gorillas competing against them at their price point in Group 1 stocks.
2329 2018-12-20 16:06:22 I need to look into investing in stocks.
2330 2018-12-20 16:06:18 Dang it ... I just want free stocks dread
2331 2018-12-20 16:06:18 Bump stocks didn't rise to national attention until the Las Vegas mass shooting. If the idea crossed Obama's mind to ban them, he would have been criticized for such a weak action on gun control. For not going far enough.
2332 2018-12-20 16:06:07 $BCC what´s up bought some at 100 a week ago because i was frustrated with stocks and thought might also throw my money away with cryptos and now almost 100% up? :D

2335 2018-12-20 16:04:55 Believe me, in fact you are. I too have to go around using ICE car, but i tried to limit to necessary trips and also smaller engine size cars for lower carbon footprint. It's impractical for me to get other than base model 3, so i'll wait and support tesla with stocks (for now).
2336 2018-12-20 16:04:39 still too early to tell but “long crypto, short stocks” could be the meme of 2019.
2337 2018-12-20 16:04:26 Not sure Brexit will sort it, However given the flying time of drones one wonders why it has lasted so long, the offender needs to be apprehended and placed in the stocks, as do you for such a stupid comment
2338 2018-12-20 16:04:23 My best trades this year have been far OTM puts on stocks parabolic Hyperwave breakdowns. The trick is to be able to hold those puts thru the ups and downs and not to take profits too early. Wish I held longer some of my put positions. $NBIX $IMMU $MCHP $AMD $MU $NFLX $AAPL
2339 2018-12-20 16:03:51 I agree! But hey, for real penny runners those who bought at trips need to be weeded out

2342 2018-12-20 16:03:11 Good news for crypto is that there are still people out there with enough cash to buy. Would also be interesting if stocks continue to slide and crypto rises into 2019. Could possibly help draw even more money in as traders seek profit anywhere they can.
2343 2018-12-20 16:03:07 lots of analysts are saying 2018 was the top for stocks and now we face a 1 to 3 year bear.  But you know what they say about everyone saying the same thing...

2351 2018-12-20 16:01:00 Had @BarackObama banned bump stocks by EO, conservatives would have exploded with fury and the backlash would have cost Democrats big. Also, Mr. Obama has a respect for the constitution and prefered legislative solutions, not governing by fiat, as does the @GOP and #TraitortRump!
2352 2018-12-20 16:00:21 I don’t care about bump stocks  personally. They are woefully inaccurate. The can also be reproduced using you belt. However, shall not be infringed is pretty clear. confiscating anyone personal property without compensation is wrong and when it’s the govt. it tyranny.
2353 2018-12-20 16:00:03 Time to buy stocks. $INDU
2354 2018-12-20 15:59:56 Some oil stocks are starting to sniff out the con and moving up today Anas, I hardly know how to act.
2355 2018-12-20 15:59:22 131. There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.
2356 2018-12-20 15:59:08 During the Obama administration  the ATF has ruled that bump stocks were a gun part and not under its jurisdiction to regulate.

2359 2018-12-20 15:57:44 wym doesn’t matter. Stocks trade off of trends and this is the steepest descending trend line within the last decade?? You sure?
2360 2018-12-20 15:57:17 @realDonaldTrump 
  Executive order on bump stocks?  Really??  Anyone think this is unconstitutional?
2361 2018-12-20 15:57:16 Ravi bhai- bottom is indeed made, if stocks to fall further brutally then new events should be more severe than recent one. For this probability is low. Valuations are are indeed high but in pockets, it’s more due to lack of any visible trend and remain so.
2362 2018-12-20 15:56:36 I bought a house, interest rate a 3.5% for 30 years. That's 1.25% over new fed rate. No wonder bank stocks can't move higher. Quit blaming fed and make better decisions with your money.
2363 2018-12-20 15:56:23 hey how are stocks lookin today?
2364 2018-12-20 15:56:12 Bigger moves now but 2008 was a year and a half and it went -57%

I still think we get a ‘it’s over, buy stocks’ rally
2365 2018-12-20 15:56:05 No one is perfect in any prediction. least so in recession  or stocks. Just a discussion point seeking various views where predictions may not be correct, which is more often the case. but still a good learning.
2366 2018-12-20 15:54:41 Just a reminder for those with retirement accounts... you do not have to hold stocks in these accounts.. you most likely can invest in Money Market type accounts learning about 2%.. talk to your investment advisor
2367 2018-12-20 15:54:40 Thanks. That's Greenspan's old guidepost. I was at a group dinner with Jeremy Siegel about a decade ago, and he noted the minor technical glitch that it mixes nominal and real data. Bonds being 100% nom. and stocks about half and half.
2368 2018-12-20 15:54:14 Ok, you're on the right thought train on war.

Now, get the white out for the bump stocks thing.
2369 2018-12-20 15:53:59 Very correct. Compounders @15% are not good enough for most investors.
They want multi baggers which are just picked by default rather as an intent.
Buy good stocks. If some turn into multibaggers it's just good luck.
You can't pick multibaggers but just good stocks
2370 2018-12-20 15:53:56 Agreed, but ban on bump stocks and criminal justice reform-as a liberal, those are high on my wish list.  Its a bizarre week!
2371 2018-12-20 15:53:29 trump banning bump stocks is the only good thing he's ever done
2372 2018-12-20 15:53:17 If we are banning bump stocks, we will need to ban 'rubber bands and pant loops' also.

2374 2018-12-20 15:52:26 Trump can’t just ban bumps stocks by decree. What in the world is he doing? In my view this is unconstitutional. It is being challenged in court by @GunOwners. This is a dangerous precedent to set that a President can just decree a law.

Nothing about paying taxes, handling insurance (health/home/auto), buying a house or car, handling or managing money/credit/debt, investing in stocks/bonds/retirement accounts. All things we're "supposed to do" that feel far more complicated than most people realize.
2384 2018-12-20 15:50:30 So was it the Chinese that helped Trump? Haha. Buy Buy American stocks. I think we can bail ourselves out by an influx of investments in our own companies. We may never have stocks priced this low again!!
2385 2018-12-20 15:50:20 Trump doesn’t care if the DOW drops, he doesn’t own any stocks. His name is on some property titles, but he’s way in debt to Russian oligarchs for all the golf courses he bought through loans they have him. I’d bet a paycheck he owes way more money than he has.

2390 2018-12-20 15:49:00 what i mean by trappy is that if you look at the $SPY (wbich tracks 500 of the leading stocks) it looks like it is trying to make shorts think its coming down so it "traps" them and then it pushed. its a tough call today and tbh I think for today youre better off scalping

2398 2018-12-20 15:45:57 Stocks are a strong buy here with the S&P 500 at 2500 with upside to 3000+ (20%+), which I expect to see within the first half of 2019.
2399 2018-12-20 15:45:19 U.S. equities are lower in choppy early trading, following yesterday's Fed rate hike decision and a drop in stocks to new lows for the year, as markets continue to parse comments from the Fed for global growth implications.

Just let me know keep Trump asking, " how's your 401 k?"

Not too good now
2420 2018-12-20 15:41:05 Where stocks yeezy in Paris?
2421 2018-12-20 15:40:54 But energy stocks have also been hit hard during the ongoing oil-price rout, with shares down 23% since the start of October and flirting with their worst quarter in a decade. ..
2422 2018-12-20 15:40:53 Bitcoin approaching your $4,200 level on the way to $7,000, $12,000. Everybody focused on stocks and missing out on the happiness.
2423 2018-12-20 15:40:52 It just makes 1 want to smash the whole #planet #crash the #stocks and destroy,,,Lol
2424 2018-12-20 15:40:05 I don't think that's what he meant. Fundamentals in stocks will (very often) be reflected onto the price, based on how well they are doing and what their future projections are. (For the bast majority,) Bitcoin and other "cryptos" don't have a "clear role" yet. It's early.
2425 2018-12-20 15:40:04 23500. That's where the analysts I read said the market was going to bottom out. But I don't see it.
With this disruptive fool in office. 

I'm calling it below 20000 minimum before I buy stocks again! It's a pessimists call just on feelings!
2426 2018-12-20 15:39:22 @kbriancox just a little advice that I hope will not offend..  Those of us that trade #pennystocks get turned off when we see promotion on stocks. I think you will get more investors without these promo people. You had great news on $SURG today but feed is full of promo accounts
2427 2018-12-20 15:38:52 Market indexes are "averages" and the average can't lead, because it's the average.  Individual stocks will lead on the upside and the downside. Learn to trade stocks properly and you will always be ahead of the market leaving people scratching their heads wonder how you did it.
2428 2018-12-20 15:38:49 Buy real stocks, don’t buy online coins
2429 2018-12-20 15:38:24 and if the fed backstops any huge drop, the millenials won't be able to buy any stocks "cheap" and, moreover, I think we'll just turn into Japan....just flat...

Just a matter of VIX and how these counter trend bounces play out.  2019 will be something else - great for traders
2444 2018-12-20 15:33:37 It's not like boomers would be moving to lower risk assets over the next cpl months or anything considering what they saw in 87, 2000, 2008. I recommend panic buying a garden variety basket of tech stocks... $AMZN $NVDA $FB $AAPL $NFLX for starters

2446 2018-12-20 15:33:29 Trump is already running for reelection. Ends stupid war in Syria, signs justice reform bill and outlaws bump stocks. He's attacking the corporate Dems left flank. He knows what he is doing and it could work IMHO.

2449 2018-12-20 15:33:12 @realDonaldTrump I am again asking you to stop the BATFE ruling on Bump Stocks. The left will not stop at that! They will be incensed to take more 2nd amendment rights. Also stand your ground and shut the government down!
2450 2018-12-20 15:33:08 Disagree. NRA should pick its’ fights and this isn’t one of them.Bump stocks are unnecessary and now an NFA item. My 2A rights haven’t been hurt at all.
2451 2018-12-20 15:33:01 "Safe" LOL!  I go in when stocks meet my criteria for purchase.
2452 2018-12-20 15:32:48 The 2/3rds didn't include ban assault weapons and bump stocks.  Which are the main issue. That article is garbage. Keep believing that the NRA has your best interest at heart instead of their coffers.
2453 2018-12-20 15:32:14 Lol, I'm not buying THOSE stocks!
2454 2018-12-20 15:31:51 Stocks are on track for their worst December since 1931, during the Great Depression. How come you're not diverting your attention to the stock market Donnie boy?
2455 2018-12-20 15:31:38 Yeah but bump stocks are made with appliances IN THE HOME. The route to making an unregulated homemade gun, while easier than we might like, is still much harder. A 3D printer is expensive the other parts would have to be ordered individually etc

2466 2018-12-20 15:29:16 The decision to ban bump stocks by @realDonaldTrump, which is obviously an "olive branch"  for the left, is a terrible decision. We give no ground on our constitutional rights. I DO NOT STAND BEHIND THE PRESIDENT ON THIS. SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED!
2467 2018-12-20 15:28:52 Bump stocks. The bone R’s are throwing to look like they care. But I’m glad they are doing this because some of the ppl that voted for Trump as one issue 2nd A voters are small biz owners that manufacture bump stocks. Boy are they mad now. He has no idea.

2470 2018-12-20 15:27:34 The weird thing is... I'm not mad about the stocks. 

It's an odd sense of winning. I just want to start taxing the F out of the rich and penalize corporations who bought back a trillion dollars in stocks off of our backs.
2471 2018-12-20 15:27:31 No one is talking about how a 15% - 20% drop across the stocks will create a financial crisis for #wmata’s pension. Taxpayers could be on the hook for tens or hundreds of millions of dollars.
2472 2018-12-20 15:27:18 Can’t wait for this farm bill to pass. Got 4 stocks on deck waiting on it.
2473 2018-12-20 15:27:17 Because it's not enough to have 90% support for pre-Mueller finding/good economy Trump.  Some in GOP worry that if stocks are in a free-fall and Trump has been credibly accused of multiple felonies, these #s may not hold and want to ensure there are no other options.
2474 2018-12-20 15:27:03 $HEMP NHOD. Farm Bill helping these small OTC stocks.
2475 2018-12-20 15:26:59 stocks are very light today, want to bounce
2476 2018-12-20 15:26:55 In regards to the Second Amendment, a ban on bump stocks and other gun attachments is unconstitutional as it violates the 9th Amendment (which prohibts the federal government from infringing upon individual liberties, even those not listed in the bill of rights).

2482 2018-12-20 15:25:37 Gun Owners of America is filing suit against the ATF and the DOJ seeking an injunction protecting gun owners from their illegal prohibition of bump stocks. The NRA is hiding in the shadows so far.

2483 2018-12-20 15:25:24 It's an irrelevant question as bump stocks are illegal anyways. Ironic though that Trump did what people feared Obama would do.
2484 2018-12-20 15:25:01 UH, maybe you don't pay attention to crude fundamentals, but in Sept, we had the lowest days of visible supply aka stocks/use since 2008.  Better research more before twittering fake news
2485 2018-12-20 15:24:52 Very clear setup today.  If the $DJIA goes green, we should see a rally lasting at least several days, likely into the new year. 

As it's been all year long, after a rally stocks will go much lower.

$GS up so far, staying barely above uptrend stretching back more than a decade.
2486 2018-12-20 15:24:46 Hello traders , simple you can be long paper stocks and short Futures , just don't think equally amounts, go more short side like i do
2487 2018-12-20 15:24:03 It probably hurts your military stocks, Lindsey and Mark Levin.  Focus on the wall. You can always move troops back into the Middle East.
2488 2018-12-20 15:23:51 Chatted to someone at a big pharma company a month ago in a bar, who asserted their employer had already spent £ millions planning contingency stocks.

2489 2018-12-20 15:23:30 People are fleeing financial stocks like we are heading back into the abyss of 2008-2009 - people have forgotten that pullbacks are a normal part of the market.  Thanks for the AIG article.  Good time to be picking up shares of AIG, AGO, BAC, and many other small banks
2490 2018-12-20 15:23:22  nice one, “ bought some ‘puts’ ...”.  Not a bad idea, stocks gonna go south for sure !

2493 2018-12-20 15:22:18 So if we have to get rid or destroy our bump stocks is Trump going to reimburse me the $100 it cost to buy it.
2494 2018-12-20 15:22:10 Made my first investment in the stocks again after a year, gonna see how it goes for me. Pray for yo boy.

2526 2018-12-20 15:15:10 I believe the behavioural impact "Put" has been highly significant. Equity investors have convinced themselves not to fear the Fed, because 'if stocks drop they'll ease'. It has been a major contributing factor to the bubbles, we've seen since 1998.

2533 2018-12-20 15:13:40 I actually think the stock market is a buy here, lots of bad news is priced in.  All that can happen at this point is the Fed backs off.  Even if they don't, it's priced in.  I own no stocks (not even in 401k).
2534 2018-12-20 15:13:32 Well we got past the 1st hour, and stocks can just melt up from here I think. I'll be back after breakfast

2546 2018-12-20 15:11:46 it is almost like he is doing this to distract from other narrative he doesn't like (like getting blasted by his base for the wall, bump stocks, etc).

2552 2018-12-20 15:09:53 Good Job @realDonaldTrump you officially just kicked every red blooded Patriot in the face with that executive ban on bump stocks. While I think bump stocks were one of the dumbest inventions ever created, it’s still My right to own one if I so choose! Read the Constitution Sir!

2560 2018-12-20 15:06:35 STOCKS are down again this morning...but the market is extremely  oversold.  A "dead cat bounce" rally may happen soon may give those who  want out of the market the opportunity to sell at a little higher price
2561 2018-12-20 15:06:30 Wasn't another campaign promise infrastructure? But infrastructure doesn't instigate hate like the wall does. So who's playing politics? Did you see how banning bump stocks united people? Shows it can be done. How about cutting out the b.s. & actually being the President for all?
2562 2018-12-20 15:06:13 Source for this? Also, the tweet is confusing - salmon stocks usually refer to wild fish, and off Clare Island similarly. The tweet suggests 50% mortality on the farm - is this true?
2563 2018-12-20 15:06:10 STOCKS are down again this morning...but the market is extremely oversold.  A "dead cat bounce" rally may happen soon may give those who want out of the market the opportunity to sell at a little higher price
2564 2018-12-20 15:05:55 @realDonaldTrump I’m a supporter of almost everything you’ve done as a president thus far, but have a couple questions. First why did you ban Bump Stocks it’s against our 2nd amendment Rights? Second Why isn’t Hillary in Jail yet?
2565 2018-12-20 15:05:53 TVIX has been the perfect buy and sell play. It was $35 dec 3rd. It's $61 today. When stocks go up, I buy TVIX as it drops. When stocks drop, I sell TVIX as it goes up. Smart Money see saw
2566 2018-12-20 15:05:00 Down to 12% of stocks in the S&P above their 50-day moving average. Extreme oversold zone.
2567 2018-12-20 15:04:34 On the other hand, corporations are buying and borrowing stock repurchases at unprecedented low rates to prop up their stocks instead of being competitive and re-investing and therefore taking on risk. So they don't have to be competitive & if an upstart comes along you buy them.

2571 2018-12-20 15:04:06 The ATF banned bump stocks.  Not Trump.
2572 2018-12-20 15:03:52 Tech must rally or we’ll chop. $FB +$5 from lows is a decent start if it holds. If we add the other FAANG stocks market might have a chance to pick up followers.

2579 2018-12-20 15:01:59 Don't you have some penny stocks that you need to pump & dump?
2580 2018-12-20 15:01:57 @realDonaldTrump   Congratulations.  You have officially enacted MORE GUN CONTROL than Barack Obama.  Bump stocks are not a problem and do not make semi autos full autos.  But your desire to appease the left means you violated YOUR OATH.  I thought you were a fighter, meh. SMDH
2581 2018-12-20 15:01:48 Hopefully I see a rise out my penny stocks! It’s been a long time coming!  #ThanksFarmBill
2582 2018-12-20 15:01:27 Why do people keep insisting the Farm Bill will trigger market rally? It didn't really occur when agreement happened, nor when it passed Congress.

2593 2018-12-20 14:59:44 LOL crazy that people are buying into stocks right before Yields invert
2594 2018-12-20 14:59:36 They have their own coastline, they can catch their own fish. Or, they can let the EU countries plunder their stocks and sell it back to them.
2595 2018-12-20 14:59:29 Don't call them illegal bump stocks, call them undocumented efficiency recoil Slide Fire stocks, and let them live in sanctuary homes.
2596 2018-12-20 14:58:50 Hey, wouldnt it be something if the govt offered threats and ultimatums to illegal aliens like you do to people who bought bump stocks? You threaten Americans with imprisonment or "comply or die" but hand 10.6 billion in aid the Mexico. Real genius going on there.

2607 2018-12-20 14:57:13 Pretty surprised to see the 10yr at 2.76% certainly there is money being made on the bond side. As I said. This is just a time to avoid trying to speculate in stocks. Sit tight. Be patient. There will huge opportunities for long term investors.

2610 2018-12-20 14:56:05 As a firearms instructor I can tell you "bump stocks" are useless. They're inaccurate and were only made for playing around nothing else. No loss there. Los Vegas shooter did NOT use a bump stock, trust me.
2611 2018-12-20 14:55:58 I dont want to be a trader why because everytime a guy like me gathers fund of 5 lakhs- 10 lakhs gets depressed of losses 40 k -50 k! 

When you trade you need to have crores so that these 40-50 k are your daily urinals!

2620 2018-12-20 14:54:15 Now can you defend our second amendment please. A terrible precedent was just set on bump stocks and we need  to bolster our constitution asap.
2621 2018-12-20 14:53:51 Even though the stock market is taking a hit right now (Bear Market), it's good to know that the dividend earnings haven't changed from most companies. Even with their stocks going down. So, investors are still getting paid. 
2622 2018-12-20 14:53:47 Stocks down as the Fed raises rates.  What is the goal of the Fed again?
2623 2018-12-20 14:53:46 Hard to pick options today. Think ill sit this out as most stocks (that i trade) have made new lows after yesterday and the market isnt strong enough to rally right now. Cat&mouse.
2624 2018-12-20 14:53:37 And that even applies to when you are approaching retirement or a retiree? You don't want to move into annuities -- or cash out some stocks for bonds or cash? It seems like being stock market-heavy creates the kind of volatility California struggles with in its budget.
2625 2018-12-20 14:53:35 I've been waiting for this pull back for nigh on 9 mos.  It's finally here.  Realistic P/E values (with other contributing factors) will get my buy.  Another 10% drop will see me buy more and so on.  Many stocks still are not quite there, so, I wait, like a panther in the dark
2626 2018-12-20 14:51:48 Bump stocks do not allow full auto.  You can accomplish the same thing with a leather belt.
2627 2018-12-20 14:51:39 what they are doing to ban guns is banning cosmetic features such as stocks, pistol grips, ect. What we need is a lawsuit that challenges the validity of banning the way a gun looks.

2629 2018-12-20 14:51:13 @kilmeade your just a stupid Fox News host that doesn't even have the Intel the President has! The biggest news today will be the passing bill to keep gov. Open! This just sunk the Republican Party for good and turned PDJT into a one term President! Watching stocks fall !
2630 2018-12-20 14:50:51 Trump does not care about bump stocks.  He needs diversions to keep people from focusing on his avalanche of malfeasance. He is throwing out crumbs, hoping the court of public opinion will dilute the Mueller findings, looking for enough support to forestall impeachment. Fox job.
2631 2018-12-20 14:50:35 Blood bath coming in stocks today, there’re  gonna kill stocks!!!!!
2632 2018-12-20 14:50:34 In Japan, tons of people ordered ipad pro at major appliance stores like Bigcamera or Yamada denki by using paypay which is new electric payment system. paypay conducted BIG campaign in this Dec. So there are no ipad stocks at those shops.
2633 2018-12-20 14:50:25 Then he took our bump stocks for no apparent reason so we'd lose that fight.
2634 2018-12-20 14:50:03 I have no idea why you would listen to a guy who pumps 50 stocks a week and be puzzled when’s he wrong! He hasn’t a clue about the company, he should stick to trading as he’s ok at that
2635 2018-12-20 14:50:03 Yes, but it’s also ironic that his followers will also pay the cost of voting for him. Farmers bankrupt, stocks down, recession looming, lay offs, and much more.
2636 2018-12-20 14:50:00 Please run in 2020. we need as many laughing stocks on the left as we can get!
2637 2018-12-20 14:49:54 He banned bump stocks. That's all I can think of and I don't know if there is a plan in place to deal with the ones already out there.
Then again it could be a ploy to get more NRA donations coming in so he changes his mind.
2638 2018-12-20 14:49:44 Since Trump's rejection in the midterms, the Dow Industrial average — with traders rallied over tariffs, tech & spreading pessimism, has lost 2,300 points, or 9%, with several slides following Trump comments. Stocks are on track for their worst December since the Great Depression
2639 2018-12-20 14:49:42 NOW on The Frank Beckmann Show: Michael Hammond with Gun Owners of America talks about the banning of "bumb stocks" and their lawsuit in response to the Trump administration
2640 2018-12-20 14:49:23 Starting to think breakfast tacos and a cold beer are a better choice here than stocks into the holiday.
2641 2018-12-20 14:49:18 I am so happy that the Trump Administration is banning bump stocks! Thank you @realDonaldTrump
2642 2018-12-20 14:49:05 Be honest, If Obama was banning bump stocks and pulling out of Syria prematurely, Republicans would be losing their minds.
2643 2018-12-20 14:48:59 No. You can assume that the gravestone doji is not a sign of a bearish reversal in stocks.

If anyone's tallied up the stats in crypto please share.

That's only one pattern. One of the worst.

There is more info in the link though.
2644 2018-12-20 14:48:28 @NRA I hope that you give @realDonaldTrump a lot of push back on his executive order banning bump stocks because if an order as this can be done an all out ban can be done at some point
2645 2018-12-20 14:48:15 $RKDA This has to do with the farm bill watching this for a pop we are in a low float market that these stocks in this price range!

2648 2018-12-20 14:47:36 Donald, why don’t we talk about what this latest shiny object is really about. You’d much prefer the nation reacting to you tucking tail and running out of Syria or a wall that Chuck & Nancy bitch slapped on rather than the WORSE December for stocks since the Great Depression

2654 2018-12-20 14:46:20 It was also possible since the 1920s to perfectly track the Dow by simply buying an equal number of each of the 30 stocks, which is why earlier indexes had fewer components (E.g FTSE 30 became FTSE 100)

2656 2018-12-20 14:45:27 Also rate hikes affect all loans corporations have which are tied to those rates. Increases in the rate increases loan payments which reduces profits and can lead to losses. This will affect future earnings negatively which leads to sell offs of affected stocks. The FED knows it
2657 2018-12-20 14:44:58 The market was to high. Stocks peaked. It is Over sold, ect.  A correction is needed, as we see. DOW home is 23,500 to 23,700. ! Danger as it settles.

2667 2018-12-20 14:41:26 The Prez did not personally ban bump stocks (agency rule-making) nor pass a small step forward on criminal justice reform (Congress). Both took months/years in the making. If he truly supported, great. We’ll see what happens in Syria.

2675 2018-12-20 14:40:00 In all honesty trump is factually doing what redneck racist said obama would do by taking away yer guns! Bump stocks are a felony. This is not opinion, this is now law.

2680 2018-12-20 14:39:22 happy holidays, and if it turns cold, keep in mind that US distillate stocks-of-demand ratio is at the lowest level since 2004 for the same week
2681 2018-12-20 14:39:15 DOJ just ruled that bump-stocks are equivalent to machine guns and thus illegal. Extremists want the right to any weapon desired.  The Second Amendment exists so that "We the People" can protect ourselves from criminals and a totalitarian government. Nunchucks are just a gimmick!
2682 2018-12-20 14:38:55 bump stocks weren't invented in 1791 ---> so technically they aren't constitutional, it only applies to actual guns.
2683 2018-12-20 14:38:51 Isn’t it wonderful that Trump has outlawed bump stocks for guns?
2684 2018-12-20 14:38:49 So cute, love boxers !
2685 2018-12-20 14:38:30 So, Trump banned all bump stocks and demands you turn in the ones you already bought.
It’s the republicans who are going to take your guns.
Brahahahahahahaha.

2687 2018-12-20 14:38:00 The only difference between a bump stock and none is that your trigger finger is gonna get a little more tired while laying down cover fire, cause that's all bump stocks are good for. Unless your argument for the 2A is, "guns are fun", but I wouldn't take that to congress.

2693 2018-12-20 14:34:41 @realDonaldTrump the country loves you. But, you just banned bump stocks and you're letting the wall get away from us. Fuck the corrupt. DTrump yourself in there and make it happen, like you do. For your people Mr. President.
2694 2018-12-20 14:34:24 Maybe b/c bump stocks weren't even thought about until the Las Vegas massacure. Damn, was he suppose to think of everything? Also, it won't be that damn easy...there will be challenges to that EO. Congress makes laws not Trump!
2695 2018-12-20 14:33:44 Saving the economy and passing ACA took priority in 2009-2010. Also, bump stocks weren't a well-known entity back then. Banning assault and assault-style weapons was pursued, in case you've forgotten.
2696 2018-12-20 14:33:21 I will continue to flip other stocks until I have 10,000,000 shares of AXXA. This took me from .0086-.3749 last time had 493,000 shares and you can do the math on that. It made me comfortable and this time it’ll make me rich.  Gawd I love this shit. She’s an ATM

2701 2018-12-20 14:31:48 I don't know, I think there's a difference between bridges to nowhere style malinvestment and changing the composition of the balance sheet. If anything I'd say the malinvest is more likely to be in start up land than in stocks
2702 2018-12-20 14:30:45 This kind of case puts the “bump stock” law into perspective. The intention of the ruling is to enact an agenda outside of any concern for safety. No one losing bump stocks is guilty of any crime or assault with a bump stock. With good intentions, you can keep your katana.

2707 2018-12-20 14:29:14 It is definitely a good achievement. Bump-stocks can be home-made and the legal ban will likely increase illegal manufacturing. Difficult to control. The fight must go on to tighten the controls on who can purchase a weapon that can use a bump-stock.
2708 2018-12-20 14:29:11 @spikes_tactical, yeah, I really wonder why @NRA is not joining the lawsuit. Kinda disappointed. I don't care one way or the other about bump stocks. But banning bump stocks opens the door to ban everything else. #2A
2709 2018-12-20 14:28:45 I'm about there too.......just gonna buy some more oil stocks before they go lower again!
2710 2018-12-20 14:28:44 Stocks are down probably
2711 2018-12-20 14:28:38 Some of the best performing stocks have high p.e. ratios and some of the worst have low p.e.’s.  I remember an analyst from a major firm recommending GM in ‘99 or ‘00 because it was only 7x earnings.  AOL had a very high p.e., but the doubled.
2712 2018-12-20 14:28:13 Wait, what?

2725 2018-12-20 14:25:27 @jimcramer The real tragedy is that the best way to long term wealth involves a significant portion of your assets in stocks.

2726 2018-12-20 14:25:09 I hope so too dude and I think stocks are overpriced dramatically in some areas. Seems the fed is on a suicide mission though and our deficits are rising and we aren't even in recession yet. Sorry I really like gold and $GDXJ

2747 2018-12-20 14:20:44 @realDonaldTrump Big mistake with bump stocks. You could have used that as leverage to get something else passed. Too many executive orders from too many executives in the last 20 yrs. If you want to change the law, congress must act.

2749 2018-12-20 14:20:22 1. About Natural gas we speak earlier and I like your article. But about oil I doubt about fundamentals factors. One year not enough for me to make strong conclusion.

2754 2018-12-20 14:19:16 That requires a change in USD reserve status.  The modest closing in income gap we’ve begun to see is primarily a function of 1 thing - stocks up so stock owners are doing projects/spending money.  Take away stock appreciation & the income gap will begin widening again, rapidly
2755 2018-12-20 14:19:10 On one hand you criticize Jim for being concerned about the FED affecting stocks and chastised him by stating to “shut up and focus on fundamentals “ while later you state “DON’T FIGHT THE FED”. Start taking your anti-schizophrenia meds again.

2769 2018-12-20 14:15:54 Rob @Unpersuaded112

One Obama observation. Before you all yell at me. I voted TWICE for him. Just listen to me for a minute. How is it possible trump bans bump stocks by executive order today but Obama didn’t? Honest question. Got me thinking.. What am I missing here?
2770 2018-12-20 14:15:20 Its speaks more to the spinelessness of this admin and their inability to connect with real American voters. So they throw out these meaningless changes hoping it will shut people up. Bump stocks dont kill people that asshole holding the gun does regardless of what stock is used
2771 2018-12-20 14:15:05 The banning of bump stocks by executive order is unconstitutional abridgment of the right to bear arms.

I would be upset if Congress did the same, but I am double upset it was executive order. This is pure tyranny.
2772 2018-12-20 14:15:04 It's my opinion no President has the right to ban any kind of weapon. It's unconstitutional. And yet he signed an executive order yesterday to do just that. Trump supporters need to speak up about overreach by executive order. It's not about bump stocks.
2773 2018-12-20 14:13:24 Anti-Gunners:  People don’t need semi-automatic weapons.  They don’t serve a purpose.
Pro-Trumpers:  People don’t need bump stocks.  They don’t serve a purpose.
2774 2018-12-20 14:13:15 The most important thing to know about the market right now is that the individual merit of stocks does not matter.
2775 2018-12-20 14:13:12 You can’t blame others for your actions especially trading stocks when you have full control over the buy or sell button. It’s gonna come back regardless imo.

2778 2018-12-20 14:12:44 well honestly a bump stock only makes a gun fire faster if you know how to use it correctly. It's not just something you slap one and now your full auto that simply isnt true. Bump stocks are a scape goat so bigger real changes were avoided they scarficed an add on 2apease people

2782 2018-12-20 14:12:14 @jimcramer Your the dumb one. The market decline is due to institutions and guys like you that ran stocks to huge over-valuation in the first 1/2 and are paying the price for it. It's not the FED's fault.

2794 2018-12-20 14:09:40 Everyone who loves Donald should sell their homes, cash in stocks, sell jewelry and mega churches in order to build that wall. Show your love for the President. #GoFundTheWall
2795 2018-12-20 14:09:24 Cheap money went companies buying back their stocks. Helps rig the price higher for the guys at the top to brag and cash out. Many borrowed money to buyback stock. Like GE $40 Billion between 20 to 33 a share. They trade in 6s now and will go bankrupt soon.
2796 2018-12-20 14:09:08 he hasn't mentioned his bank stocks in weeks on twitter. he's down 20% plus on C, JPM, GS and WFC..and he added all the way down.
2797 2018-12-20 14:09:08 yeah, people will work 2 jobs to make $$ but won't attend the 1h session at the bank explaining diversification, reduce exposure to stocks closer to retirement, don't sell on hiccups, etc. Then invest it all on Nortel, BBD, TSLA, BTC or whatnot and lose it all. #casino=#fail

2799 2018-12-20 14:08:47 I wonder if all the AIM and UK equities traders look at the macro picture (global risk off) before trading - I see lots of these AIM stocks headlines in the morning and people commenting on buying more - I am avoiding equities right now

2805 2018-12-20 14:07:34 @jimcramer Not only were the working people just beginning to have higher wages, they were also just beginning to buy stocks again for the first time in a generation.
2806 2018-12-20 14:07:20 A hopeful though is that it feels like Jan. 2016 right now. Here's a MarketWatch lead from that selloff:
U.S. stocks closed sharply lower Friday, locking in the worst 10-day start to a calendar year ever, as oil prices plunged and investors worried about slowing growth in the US
2807 2018-12-20 14:07:16 @KamalaHarris     Hey Harris,  how come you and congress didn't create a bill to ban the bump stocks?  What does congress do except complain about issues they don't fix????                                    THANK YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP

Spooked by another worldwide stocks selloff, global investors have piled up cash to a more than two-year high this month, hoovered up bonds and cut back property holdings. Brexit worries have also made the UK stock…
2820 2018-12-20 14:02:39 Its insane for fed to rig the ES at 2600 anyway. 

These Corp buybacks are likely going to be the black Swan event. Burned So much money rigging the stocks higher.
2821 2018-12-20 14:02:29 They buy it from higher net worth people.  No they don't burn it, they buy different stocks or bonds.  If you have 10million dollars, and you get an extra 2 million you don't spend more, you just hold on to it.  However, if you only have 10,000 and you get an extra 1000 you spend
2822 2018-12-20 14:02:19 I've always heard "sin" stocks are a good bet in rocky times because people tend to rely more heavily on their vices - alcohol, tobacco, etc...

GIVING FARMERS WELFARE. 

Now we need ASSAULT weapons ban AND 
STOP the Trade WARS and Tarriffs
2828 2018-12-20 14:00:38 Thank you for being the voice of reason. I despise Trump and disagree with him 99% of the time, but he was right to ban bump stocks and right to withdraw from Syria. BUT, he is not opposed to war on ethical grounds, but because it is expensive (and Putin wants US out).
2829 2018-12-20 14:00:16 No wall,no (bump stock) guns, higher interest rates, stocks down... trumpers still winning? Hahaha @realDonaldTrump
2830 2018-12-20 14:00:11 Son of one of the top businessman in the country, who had revolutionised the agriculture industry then later on stocks and investments. 

He had business and money than joined politics unlike many others who joined politics to make money.
2831 2018-12-20 13:59:53 Now conservatives like peace? Next you’ll be telling me they’re going to ban bump stocks and explode the deficit.
2832 2018-12-20 13:59:51 @trish_regan I think the reason the Fed is raising interest rates is to drive people out of stocks and into treasuries & mortgage backed securities which the Fed is selling. It looks like the people buying is greater than the Fed selling which is why interest rates still down.
2833 2018-12-20 13:59:34 WAT ABOUT OUR STOCKS?

Now ?????   !
2834 2018-12-20 13:59:28 Pulling Troops out of Syria and banning bump stocks, Trump is
2835 2018-12-20 13:59:26 Many of his followers don’t own stocks so they have no idea. I’ve seen a huge loss in mine. The economy is doing very badly right now and I suspect after people stop spending Christmas money, it’s going to be even worse
2836 2018-12-20 13:59:04 honest?? LOL you seen a tweet about him loading up on bank stocks two months ago and adding all the way down?? didn't think so.

2839 2018-12-20 13:57:36 Hey @pboockvar the real policy error has been convincing the American citizenry to put the majority of their net worth in stocks and then give them a nice retirement plan saying they will make 9% compounded a year. Watch out below
2840 2018-12-20 13:57:27 Some people should only be investing in Guaranteed Investment Certificates (GICs), bonds, cash (under their mattress mot likely) and a house. They have no business whatsoever investing in stocks. If you have problems sleeping because of your investments, just don't do it.

2853 2018-12-20 13:53:21 Not a single person said there'd be a bump stock ban because not a single person had heard of bump stocks until Vegas...when Trump was President.
2854 2018-12-20 13:52:44 Its not War for oil. Its now War to keep the economy afloat. Debt/interest for the Bankers, War for Jobs, War for Profits, War for Retirement. Everyone PULL EVERY DIME out of all the BANKS, FUNDS, Stocks from ANY Company that profits from WAR.  WAR will END!
2855 2018-12-20 13:52:24 Good things:
1. Bump stocks banned 
2. Prison Reform (a start- lots to do to make amends for racism in many areas)
3. No shut down and no wall 
4. Communities have been given the chance to hold opiate producers accountable & make them fund recovery projects

2861 2018-12-20 13:51:03 there is probably one, rattling around, knocking into things, like his exec order on bump stocks and then ooh oooh let's pull out of syria and let vlad have it because we defeated isis! I'm sure there is a little birdy in his ear just abusing his easily distracted mind.

2865 2018-12-20 13:49:52 @DLoesch what about talking about how @realDonaldTrump  screwed the American people by taking gun rights away. Bump stocks gone and we now have to discard rifes, and in NJ rounds reduced in clips! He is a liar! What about protecting our 2nd Ammendment rights.

2882 2018-12-20 13:44:22 Tell me why 401(k)s have to be fully invested in US Equities...  LOTS of other options beyond $SPX. There are times to be fully invested in stocks (2009) and times to reduce exposure (2000) and we believe longest Bull Market in US is over, there will be a reset then buy again.
2883 2018-12-20 13:44:22 I will agree with some people here.  I am a ltc gun owner myself and I dont see why bump stocks are needed...  They aren't fully taking guns just one component.

2885 2018-12-20 13:43:43 Not the same, but arguably close cousins.

In "Demystifying Equity Risk-Based Strategies: A Simple Alpha plus Beta Description” De Carvalho, Lu, and Moulin (2012) find that the key factor exposures in a minimum variance portfolio is low beta and low residual volatility stocks.

2890 2018-12-20 13:42:02 Not that I expected it, quite the opposite actually. 

But getting all worked up about a 22% drop one day in pennyland is just childish. It will also rise 22% or more on any given day too. 

You should not be investing in penny stocks if you’re frightened of volatility.

2897 2018-12-20 13:39:04 True Michael, but as so many financial relationships are tied to stocks (pension obligations, taxes, etc), the pain that will be felt as this bubble bursts will be enormous. I’m not sure it can be accomplished without significant changes to the system.

2904 2018-12-20 13:36:29 US futures point to more trouble for stocks at Thursday's open. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell implying a decline at the opening bell. Meanwhile, S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures also pointed to declines at the open. $UNIX  Happy Trading

2908 2018-12-20 13:35:37 Very bad week.  Caved on the wall, Judge says bring back asylum seekers, confiscating bump stocks w/o compensation is wrong -slide of spt for 2A, listen to SecDef of Syria, Fed rate hike.  GOP let us down.
2909 2018-12-20 13:35:36 Not Laizefaire! 
Devil's labyrth tortuous path.

Federal Reserve cuts its outlook for U.S. economy; stocks plunge ?tid=ss_tw-amp
2910 2018-12-20 13:35:02 Yes, oh and by the way, just go ahead and hand over those bump stocks you got. No one fights harder on 2a rights.. .
2911 2018-12-20 13:34:57 ..why did McConnell refuse to take up Obama’s criminal justice reform?
..seriously, Trump’s withdrawal is to appease the public and not Putin?..
..bump stocks are also low hanging fruit..
2912 2018-12-20 13:34:52 #Oil down in delayed reaction to Fed related sell off.  Even with slow global growth we see #WTI supported below $50 by slower growth in US production and higher gas demand. US production still likely to grow in 2019, which is attractive environment for #MLPs. #Stocks #Income
2913 2018-12-20 13:34:48 same i wanna buy but i scared no stocks
2914 2018-12-20 13:34:40 wow may deflation of stocks pala HAHAHAHHA

2916 2018-12-20 13:34:15 A big thank you to Ellen and the @GiveBloodNHS team at Norfolk Street, #Manchester. I’m back giving blood after a two year gap. Stocks are low this Christmas. It takes less than an hour sign up today and help save lives.
2917 2018-12-20 13:33:49 Quick Market Thoughts:

$TNX 10y note: 2.75 is measured target from break below 3%

% of NYSE stocks above 200sma now at 16 - below 20 historically a buy

$SPX S&P 500: near term target remains 2400.  2800-2600 = 200pts.  2600-200pts = 2400 target
2918 2018-12-20 13:33:49 Talk about calling the kettle black. Look in the mirror, kass. people that claim to run a hedge fund but never disclose their returns, yet brag about the occasional winner continuously while crickets on massive losers like your bank stocks are doing nothing but selling a product
2919 2018-12-20 13:33:12 The Fed is taking on board the effects that sinking stocks - tightening financial conditions - will have on the economy but is not seeing an additional signal about the future from stock and bond markets
2920 2018-12-20 13:33:07 There are a lot of investment opportunities in the industrial sector stocks
I don't think it will last for very long
#SP500
2921 2018-12-20 13:32:32 We gave up bump stocks. (Fine to me as long as the guns are safe) in exchange for doubt in others minds who hate trump for no reason. They may think, “hey I like that move I guess he has some of the same ideas as I do” or silences them for a bit at the least.
2922 2018-12-20 13:32:16 My thoughts too!
We could end up in a permanent fishing war with the Dutch, French, Irish and Icelandic, where there will be little prospect of resolution and only the fish stocks will lose!!
2923 2018-12-20 13:31:45 I still can’t get over what Chanos said recently , why can’t the market deal with ~3% rates on bonds? Something in this market is broken, Jim. If ~3% is enough to scare people out of stocks then something deeper is wrong with stocks.
2924 2018-12-20 13:31:42 My exciting update of the week - I have joined a new library! It's five mins walk from my office and stocks loads of new books and bestsellers - lots of books I want to read!
2925 2018-12-20 13:31:38 Learn how to day trade stocks! That's my #2
2926 2018-12-20 13:30:25 No name on this response but screening new low list last 2 days for $2 + stocks that are up 1%+ or down 10%+ on day, and discarding E&P, Biotech & Finance names yields an interesting list of names to screen for value, many of which may be pretty much washed out. fwiw
2927 2018-12-20 13:30:06 romanian stocks down another 2% today, the day, or not
2928 2018-12-20 13:29:58 On the other hand, we had a summer student once who made a pretty good contact angle measurement setup involving my old digital camera, a stack of beer mats and some of those stocks used for stirring coffee, amongst other bits and bobs.

2930 2018-12-20 13:29:15 .05 cents is a no brainer, .10 cents is still conservative and going higher. This is a MASSIVE PLAY ! Sounds nuts to even talk .10 cents, but the DD clearly suggests it.

2935 2018-12-20 13:28:24 US stock futures edged higher today, following sharp pullback in the prior session after the Fed. Res. stuck to its plan to keep withdrawing monetary support from an economy

2936 2018-12-20 13:28:17 Short answer: it depends. 
1) What is your time horizon for needing to spend it?
2) How actively do you want to manage it, to reinvest as conditions evolve?

Not giving investment advice, but for me, some going into good domestic stocks and some into cash. Review in 2-3 months.
2937 2018-12-20 13:28:02 #Grain calls mixed to higher. US #Dollar & Crude are lower. Stocks are higher this am.
2938 2018-12-20 13:27:23 the worst is when i sand bag a little in an arena cuz im clearly up 2 stocks, slip up and take some dumb %, then die at like 50 to a heavy mashing face
2939 2018-12-20 13:27:20 #Grains are mixed to higher. US Dollar & #Crude are lower. Stocks are higher. US should avoid a gov’t shutdown.
2940 2018-12-20 13:27:15 FWIW I think the “amazingly cheap” comments are based mostly on comparing valuations today to valuations of the stocks even just a couple months ago. Agree it boils down to a Quality + Growth narrative for most names. $AAPL is closest to a “classical value” name, IMO.
2941 2018-12-20 13:27:03 It's no wonder the government wants to make bump stocks illegal

#BuildTheWall
#DrainTheSwamp
#MAGA
2942 2018-12-20 13:26:48 The reason why they could not ban bump stocks before is because the law did not permit them to prohibit it.
Obama had advanced criminal justice reform as well.
Syria is seen as a gift to Putin, Turkey and Iran.

2948 2018-12-20 13:25:56 Do you work in prisons? We got mini criminals in there leaving no room for major crimes! Bump stocks SHOULD be banned, NO one needs those!! Wall?....that’s on GOP congress who never fail to get weaker & weaker & Syria, I agree on this one, slow departure would be better!
2949 2018-12-20 13:25:40 I could care less about his logic. He’s a terrible human being and his policies on everything until this week have been awful. BUT we just got bump stocks banned, criminal justice reform, and brought troops home. Be thankful!

2953 2018-12-20 13:23:40 He could have banned bump stocks on the first day of his administration. Congress had the votes to pass legislation anytime over the past six years, but were blocked by the NRA/GOP. 

Syria withdrawal was "announced" on twitter and no one in the DoD has any idea what it means.
2954 2018-12-20 13:23:40 We can focus on more than 1 issue and we have to if we want to move forward in the future - We still have not banned bump stocks ( although we are close  ) do you think we should ban bump stocks ?
2955 2018-12-20 13:23:20 Everyone's worried about the government shutdown .But I'm more worried about the gun control agenda. LETS ban bump stocks completely and dont work to regulate them for law abiding citizens such as the same class as a  suppressors or fully auto. No just gunna banned them way to go
2956 2018-12-20 13:22:58 Gas is $2 here which since I drive  suburban I appreciate but the president has nothing to do with gas prices. Everyone who has critical thinking skills knows this. But hell, I cant afford the cheaper gas...I stopped spendng b/c my stocks tanked. My kids 529s tanked too. #broke
2957 2018-12-20 13:22:42 I want to know how the Government is going to reimburse all the owners which purchased Bump Stocks when they were legal & legitimate accessories. They were legally approved by the @ATFHQ and now owners are losing $200 to $300 each.
Similarly to Eminent Domain, the Govt MUST pay
2958 2018-12-20 13:22:27 Just a reminder, the FED no longers cares to control the stock market since they starting to roll off their balance sheet (old news here), and it's your fault for buying stocks at crazy P/E (even older wisdom).  Maybe right now is the right time to start buying instead of crying.
2959 2018-12-20 13:22:27 Banning bump stocks doesn’t solve anything. If at all the impact is marginal.
2960 2018-12-20 13:22:25 You can build a really nice yield cash flow with some good stocks at these prices. Certainly a market for income, bunts and singles. Concur with your 2019 outlook (not that my opinion/endorsement matters except to my trading account).  :)
2961 2018-12-20 13:22:24 So @GOP @realDonaldTrump two years of Pres, Sen and House and you: didn't fund a wall, repeal, replace ACA, now going after bump stocks, leaving a void in Syria, tariffs causing stock market woes, economy slowing. Can't wait for the next two years with Dem house.  #changein2020
2962 2018-12-20 13:22:21 ..what took them so long on bump stocks?..
..what was his direct involvement in criminal justice reform?..
..only Russia approves of his Syrian withdrawal..
2963 2018-12-20 13:21:34 President Trump just banned bump stocks.
2964 2018-12-20 13:21:32 Markets will lead* the Economy down is my best guess. But you have to remember, a lot of this industries like Autos (and Semis) are dominated by China now. Those stocks are down because of China not the US.

2970 2018-12-20 13:18:50 Thanks. I had checked. It’s a crazy market at the moment, no stocks, really high bottom cost. A trade off between shortage now but deteriorating demand outlook. To be honest, God knows where this goes.
2971 2018-12-20 13:18:26 CJR was bipartisan watch something stinks in the bill, the NRA is suing regarding the bump stocks and if you think the govt is going to defend it and not cave , and withdrawal from Syria with no plan and abandon US allies — know you looking to write something good but 
2972 2018-12-20 13:18:06 What does that really mean specifically? I know the Fed will stop buying treasuries and rates went up .25 but what does that have to do with the bid for stocks?
2973 2018-12-20 13:17:36 Great to see @carolmassar back on screen. The biggest question the FED wants no part of is the lag of global economic softness already visible in stocks. It's nice to have dry powder but might need to be used. I'm glad #correlationdefenseworks.

2976 2018-12-20 13:17:13 Same situation here, but I try to live off the dividends and not sell stocks. So my net worth is way down, but income is okay so far. Hoping we get Democrats in soon and get out of these absurd trade wars and tax policies before too much damage is done.
2977 2018-12-20 13:17:13 I think @HeatherParryUK will tell you it has worked in her experience, but of course it won't in all. Down to the client at the end of the day. I refuse work from known late payers all the time, and I tell them why.
2978 2018-12-20 13:17:05 He blocked me, and not certain why. I think it may have been mentioning that I actually liked a couple of the GGMS stocks (which, of course, later graduated to the FASP......SQ and TTD, specifically)

2981 2018-12-20 13:14:09 Because bump stocks were not an issue when Obama was President. They were not sold en mass until after Las Vegas made them a must-have for every basement arsenal. Before then, most patriots were relying on illegal machine gun conversion kits.

2994 2018-12-20 13:09:37 I see Trump is using Middle East to deflect attention after; 1) Powell ignored threats, hiked last night and said Fed doesn't care what President says/tweets, and, 2) stocks are now even lower
2995 2018-12-20 13:09:22 Can we please stop conflating "low vol" with "min vol"?

Low vol is a highly concentrated portfolio of broadly homogeneous low volatility stocks from low volatility sectors. 

Min vol portfolios are optimized to seek diversity in order to equalize marginal risk contributions.

3023 2018-12-20 13:01:31 Since 1792 in the US, stocks have always recovered from every bear market, even the most severe. Remember, the US has faced far more dire circumstances (A civil war, 2 world wars, a depression that saw unemployment at 25%) and gone on to make new highs. 

Don't short America.

3039 2018-12-20 12:54:07 The S&P 500 is now 14.5% below its Sept. 20 record high-More than 50% of S&P companies are also down by at least 20% from their 52-week highs & some segments of the market,including small-cap stocks,are already in bear territory.
3040 2018-12-20 12:53:59 The truth is that all investors in small caps miners are suffering. I don't think you can honestly have held stocks the past few months & claim success. Nor can I or anyone else pretend emotions don't play a part. Trick is to keep the emotions under control & enough cash to cope
3041 2018-12-20 12:53:35 I don’t believe bump stocks were involved in any mass shootings during Obama’s Administration, so it wasn’t an issue until Las Vegas.
3042 2018-12-20 12:53:31 Well I bought 2 packs of Ibuprofen this morning from a well known High St chemists, as the stocks looked a little low on the shelves.

3049 2018-12-20 12:52:05 Trump used bump stock as a diversion. He is running out of distractions and now things like withdrawal from Syria is another diversion for his criminal prosecution. Why didn't he support ban of bump stocks after the school shooting in FL? As I said, a madman's diversions tactic.
3050 2018-12-20 12:51:30 In Nov, Dems win the house, they go on Msm and mention recession,the fake news yells recession, the program traders use algorithm methods when key words trigger sell programs and the mkt sells baskets of stocks. Thus mkt goes straight down. Dems will be doing this thru 2020
3051 2018-12-20 12:51:21 Dear Republicans, Trump took away bump stocks, which hurts your second amendment rights why aren't you mad? Oh yeah that's right because it wasn't Obama, The Man who never once wanted to take away your rights but because he's black you hated him. Hypocrite scum
3052 2018-12-20 12:50:55 Or it is saying that the markets are extremely overvalued and need a reset. Stocks are not a Fed mandate but unemployment is and that number is currently extremely low on a historical basis.

3054 2018-12-20 12:50:01 Entitled to your opinion, but the families of those soldiers would probably disagree.    And drawing a line in the sand on bump stocks is a bit ridiculous.
3055 2018-12-20 12:48:53 Poor thing. Meanwhile... Stocks are on track for their worst December since 1931, during the Great Depression.
3056 2018-12-20 12:48:21 Bump stocks are not as important as semi auto rifles. NFA reform could mitigate the “loss” of bump sticks. But honestly, other areas should matter more. Like a middle tier between normal firearms and NFA restricted weapons for things like short barreled shotguns/rifles.

3078 2018-12-20 12:39:50 An important fact. Bump stocks were designed to assist individuals with fine motor skills issues to shoot. They should have only been sold with medical certificates much like handicapped parking placards.

3110 2018-12-20 12:24:10 Yep, just like criminal justice reform and banning bump stocks.
3111 2018-12-20 12:23:23 Sure, that's how the S&P index is constructed, by definition. Would you prefer an equal-weighted index fund? My point is much broader and simpler: figure out your target allocation: say 60/40 stocks/bonds and reallocate when movement in the market changes this allocation.
3112 2018-12-20 12:22:08 Very good - agree with yours and @thinkdefence observation that ultimately depends on the settlement.  What struck me most was the emphasis on stocks and spares, reminded me of the best parts of the 81, DR.  Also, makes sense re: credibility & responding to a threat close in time

3129 2018-12-20 12:16:17 I'll research it, but, I bet legally it has no real effect on anything other than clarification that bump stocks are a modification to a weapon that makes it fully automatic. Technically that's all accurate. And legally speaking that's already against the law.

3139 2018-12-20 12:08:12 Another story that hasn’t gotten enough attention - politicians are incentivized to not place regulations on tech giants because FANG stocks are largely propping up the US economy.

Regulations would stunt their ability to beat their chest about the economy.

3144 2018-12-20 12:06:14 The SPX is lagged in this chart.  I.e., the SPX changes occur before the ISM changes.  It’s 4q avg yearly change in SPX vs ISM year change, which is always yoy due to seasonals.  In general, wealth effect etc. from stocks will impact investment/purchasing decisions.

3147 2018-12-20 12:03:13 stocks are good long-term investments, but you have to remember to think long-term as well. “In the short-term, markets can be very volatile, but over the course of decades, you’re rewarded for your patience and discipline."

3158 2018-12-20 11:56:16 This is amazing.  Now the 0 lives killed by bump stocks in an average year will remain at 0.

3160 2018-12-20 11:55:41 Oh and btw, by adding no more bump stocks and prison reform to the Syria pullout, I’d swear trump is veering left, knowing his sheep are in the corral to stay.

3165 2018-12-20 11:52:37 It's been a week of odd, bad, decisions by Trump.  Banning bump stocks, withdrawing from Syria, allowing Mitch to totally roll over with a CR until Pelosi takes over.  Wow.

3180 2018-12-20 11:45:18 I believe they grandfathered bump stocks in. So everyone bought a bunch. And I predict they will send leftovers to central/south America so the gangs can keep terrorizing people to send them here so the "base" can justify their wall. 
Color me cynical.
3181 2018-12-20 11:45:04 Not sure which way things are looking BUT at least stocks are reacting somewhat normal to their relative influences.

3194 2018-12-20 11:38:25 Depends how long you want to wait. Always had terms as 14 days, generally accept most pay on 28 days. But if terms are 28 days and they don’t pay on time you’re looking at it being six weeks post invoice before you’re likely to see money and that gets a bit beyond a joke. 1/2

3245 2018-12-20 11:10:26 It certainly seems that way.  The economy is clearly slowing; energy prices are down; the dollar is strong; and stocks are down over 10% in less than 3 months.  The rate hike today wasn’t necessary, it was punitive.

3278 2018-12-20 10:55:18 A lot of people agree that bump stocks are a dumb novelty but it's the principle of the matter. They are reinterpreting law to ban an item that has been decided on at least 2 previous occassions that they cannot ban based on current law. It is an infringement plain and simple.

3286 2018-12-20 10:48:26 Yes, I thought prison reform was about conditions inside prison. Which is important. But all I’ve heard about are sentencing changes. I hope there is more too it. Bump stocks are illegal. That’s ok with me. Should have never been approved.
3287 2018-12-20 10:48:21 The seals are starving and killing their own pups! Fish stocks are too low to support the unchecked population explosion in New Zealand AND Eastern Canada!!

3288 2018-12-20 10:47:27 because valuations are not only the basis of numbers , stories behind stocks affect the PE heavily.. and to believe in story u need to be in love with your story which may fructify in future..

3295 2018-12-20 10:43:29 Here's a thought , build your wall with the garbage books from Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingrahm, Sean Hannity, Greg Jeffries and your garbage book  ! And maybe you can line your bump stocks in the top of the wall !

3297 2018-12-20 10:42:42 In #datascience people still want to use #timeseries for modeling stocks: except for real short term relative to the frequency of data, this is not a good model actually, it's just curve fitting ;) true model would take into account the interests of agents and they are different.
3298 2018-12-20 10:42:07 
3299 2018-12-20 10:41:47 The only thing you know about bump stocks is what you've read on google. You have no experience with firearms, yet you fear them. A true coward.
3300 2018-12-20 10:41:18 I have questions like who the heck stocks napkins
3301 2018-12-20 10:41:15 I don't like commenting on specific stocks. I noted the release on pricing. I think what they mentioned was quite well known & maybe just a realisation from the retail market.  Demand will continue but new mines will struggle as we've said for some time.

3305 2018-12-20 10:38:37 You can get decent 2% ones if you pay in a set amount regularly without touching it. But i don't think you can get much more without going into stocks and bonds.

3307 2018-12-20 10:38:27 I think we knew about the bump stocks for awhile. Syria was new but maybe he’s trying to see reactions. He maybe moved goalpost for wall or will have to be creative for funding but he didn’t cave. I was happy to see criminal justice reform as bipartisan.
3308 2018-12-20 10:38:23 Realistically, the money you have already invested is going to take the hit if you get too crazy. Future contributions should be plowed into this decline. You’re buying into stocks cheaply and that makes $$$ 2@3 years and DEFINITELY 10-20 years down the road.
3309 2018-12-20 10:38:22 Talk about a “stick in the mud”! Fed is doing what it’s done before, screwing up a good thing! 

How far have stocks dropped since the Dems victory in November?

3354 2018-12-20 10:15:31 Bump stocks are not an effective use of ammo in tactical situations and though I dont think are a threat to public I see them only as attempt to skirt existing law that is not necessary to self defense even against tyrannical government

Bump stocks should never have been legal in that is a modification to make semiauto fire automatically, You only curl your finger once to fire many rds

3380 2018-12-20 09:54:53 You’re also not supposed to leave real rates negative year after year during an expansion. If stocks can’t handle real rates being neutral then it just proves how overvalued they were in the first place. Not to mention stocks shouldn’t be part of the Feds mandate.

3387 2018-12-20 09:50:32 Rate sensitive stocks should do well
3388 2018-12-20 09:50:24 To me, these are the questions...many stocks down, 30-40 percent.  Fed will raise 50 bp total, all of next year, IF growth continues at moderate, acceptable rate.  Given that, isn't the equity dive ahead itself. Interest rates below 3% are not historically high. Is it the debt?
3389 2018-12-20 09:50:00 Yeah he was, feel sorry for him as he’s trying his best. Think he’s been badly advised. And now paying for it, he sounded out a few home truths about Rhodes and Abdi shocking from those guys
3390 2018-12-20 09:49:14 Well done Justin for selling out of resource stocks after some of them have dropped 75% in value......good strategy to sell after a huge sell off  I seem to remember Justin saying he was a ‘long term investor’

Sometimes stocks go down, get over it.
3394 2018-12-20 09:46:35 no he is right, one aspect is entertainment and the other is market manipulation, especially on volatile stocks like $tsla and in some cases there were signs of trading on the news just before they broke like the WSJ piece.

3400 2018-12-20 09:42:42 In real life you have this situation with pensions. Shortly before your pension date, would you rather invest your pension money in:

B- stocks that will yield +3% guaranteed. 

I would choose B !

3614 2018-12-20 07:21:57 How many takeovers are within 20% of the stocks all time high. Who?
3615 2018-12-20 07:20:58 The Fed mobster guys are trying to get people to move their money out of the market now and take big losses. Once the market rises everyone will try and buy back in paying higher prices for the same stocks. It's a machine that the insiders get sloppy rich off of.
3616 2018-12-20 07:20:56 Haha. Why do you think apple’s sales are so bad and stocks are so low. Too expensive products and now they’re ok to sell defective products? No wonder they are sinking fast. Sorry @tim_cook , that’s pretty cheap.
3617 2018-12-20 07:20:03 @Batakenya Ever thought of oppening more shops like the one that was at Taj Mall? Sell dead stocks at auch shops at discounted prices. Embakasi residents could afford them.
3618 2018-12-20 07:19:18 They can take my bump stocks. I don’t need them to feel like a man.
3619 2018-12-20 07:18:21 Chinese big-cap stocks are slumping.
The SSE50 index which tracks the 50 biggest stocks listed in Shanghai is down 1.7% to hit the LOWEST since May 2017.
3620 2018-12-20 07:17:41 Sir is there any two indicators we must focus on that in nifty.. bank nifty... stocks..so that we survive life time in stock market.

3622 2018-12-20 07:17:25 Bump stocks are private property rights don't let them take it.
3623 2018-12-20 07:17:13 leftists who support gun control: why? (genuine question. i get banning bump stocks and shit like that.)
3624 2018-12-20 07:17:06 I think Jared Kushner pushed for prison reforms because his father did time for a few years. Plus, I think Trump is trying to suck up to Dems because we took the House. He thinks passing prison reform & banning bump stocks will make the Dems like him. Trump isn’t a deep thinker
3625 2018-12-20 07:16:37 Where did we get that USD to begin with? We definitely didn’t have stocks of it in a vault somewhere neither did we earn it economically. Kindly explain the source of the usd then we start from there.

3627 2018-12-20 07:16:03 You also get credit for caving on the wall budget and banning bump stocks, paving the way for Pelosi to remove semi auto rifles. Good job! You will not be re-elected if you keep up such good work. #BorderWall

3632 2018-12-20 07:11:28 OK - so it is a quality and growth story. That makes sense to me, as quality stocks do have a place in a portfolio.

I was just seeing people describe them as being amazingly cheap. (?) (Someone needs to convince me that I'm wrong so I have a new, negatively correlated strategy.)
3633 2018-12-20 07:11:10 Lots of credit in messing up the economy with steel stocks down over 50% ytd and Dow is at 52 week lows! Great job!!!
3634 2018-12-20 07:09:40 Banning Bump Stocks, Banning Non PC Speech. Nanny States. And complete breaching of our national security. Buckle up folks. The storm is on it's way. 
3635 2018-12-20 07:09:23 The NRA lobbyists pressured the GOP on the large cap.Semi Auto, to point at it being a Mental health problem not a type of weapon problem, The Obama administration  looked into 3D printed auto bodies instead of Bump Stocks.The ATF missed the issue.
3636 2018-12-20 07:08:43 Expertise in one field does not always carry over into others. 
Great example: doctors think they can trade stocks.
3637 2018-12-20 07:08:39 Deripaska is ceding control of Rusal just like Wilbur Ross was divesting bank stocks.

Manafort promised to deliver on a visa for OVD in exchange for “black caviar” as his emails via indicted conspirator Kilimnik show. 

Deripaska was sanctioned in 1999 FOR GOOD REASON.
3638 2018-12-20 07:08:03 Holy shit the trump administration banned bump stocks! I’m super impressed! Good job!

3640 2018-12-20 07:07:18 Polk clears the stage and halves his stocks, because he only needed one term.
3641 2018-12-20 07:06:26 Expert Advice- #In the previous session, #Nifty continued the up move and broke above 10940 . This will keep the short term trend positive unless we see close below previous low. Use strict stoploss at current levels.

3642 2018-12-20 07:06:18 I wish talking about money wasn’t considered taboo. Let’s discuss debt, share saving strategies, and talk about stocks, fam.  The more you know, the more your bank account can grooooow.
3643 2018-12-20 07:04:47 Of course he’s serious, and you are wrong. Obama did not “green light” them, effectively or otherwise. In 2010 US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms determined bump stocks couldn’t be regulated unless Congress changed the law. They tried to reclassify it but the attempt failed.
3644 2018-12-20 07:04:21 Always the stocks vs. flows issue.

Where I grew up in SoCal, local majorities went from White, to Latino, to Asian over maybe the last 50 years.

Oddly enough, it's gone Republican since at least 1980...until 2018.
3645 2018-12-20 07:04:19 But also banning bump stocks. Mixed bag.
3646 2018-12-20 07:03:46 In Switzerland everyone who owns a gun must be licensed and trained and their guns registered. It's like owning a car. And they can't own mass killing machines like AR-15s with bump stocks and 60-round magazines.

I don't see Ms. #SuperPredator backing criminal justice reform. And I'm uncertain about the ban on bump stocks. At best she'd be 1 for 3. #Neoliberalism

1/Initial mkt reactions : stocks erased gains and Usd got support. 

2/Jay expressed concerns on outlook + foresaw 2 more hikes in 2019. 

All in more hawkish than I initially thought but more dovish than oct-nov.

3662 2018-12-20 06:50:36 Then he must be put in stocks and humiliated on the National Mall. How could anyone possibly criticize Mueller?
3663 2018-12-20 06:50:24 Thanks for the feedback. Which multiples specifically are you looking at that appear low?

Other than the multiple, it looks like a quality/moats argument - is that right? Do you think the same argument can be applied to other tech stocks, or just to the ones in your list?

3668 2018-12-20 06:48:53 No.....Your 'cute' semantics do not jibe with my #RawTruth dear so.....NO.  Obama DID NOT APPROVE 'bump stocks'  -  unless you have a problem with comprehension I'm sure you must admit you've misspoken.
3669 2018-12-20 06:48:43 Nope,due respect,when u come up with justification for farm loan waiver it prove either a) you are blindly supporting pappu or b)just happy abt your shorts in certain stocks. Loan waiver distroys banking,U know that!! Somehow malign Modi is ur agenda, can prove it, be responsbile
3670 2018-12-20 06:48:34 stocks started at 6000 - now at 23,000 -
3671 2018-12-20 06:47:04 Aluminum stocks like Hindalco, Nalco and Vedanta declined 2% each. Aluminium stocks down on news of sanctions on Rusal being lifted. #MOMarketUpdates
3672 2018-12-20 06:46:38 Easier to get into trading shit coins too. There is a bigger barrier to entry to start buying metal mining stocks but when they pop its off of real fundamental changes in the company like finding a new deposit or opening new mines etc.
3673 2018-12-20 06:45:40 Try supporting yourself for a year on a minimum wage job, then ask yourself who is exploiting who.  The real world is a lot different than trust fund babies like you imagine, as you live off the dividends of the oil stocks you inherited from your daddy.
3674 2018-12-20 06:45:37 More than three quarters of all stocks in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index were down, and Japan’s Topix slid more than 2 percent. Other asset classes were more restrained, with the yen posting a modest gain and Treasuries steady after an overnight jump. Oil slumped below $48.
3675 2018-12-20 06:45:33 Yes...... the freedom to purchase bump stocks ..and any other device I see fit to put on my firearm. Scoff all you want, but make no mistake, this doesn’t end here. The left won’t stop until they have the entirety of the second amendment....but that doesn’t bother you I guess..
3676 2018-12-20 06:45:19 Reliance, Infosys, HDFC Twins, Hindalco are major losers in the Nifty stocks. Metal and Private Banking stocks are witnessing profit booking. Cement, Tyre and select NBFC stocks gained.  #MOMarketUpdates
3677 2018-12-20 06:45:14 Shows that they have some long term interest in Zimbabwe. I read an article in the Havard business review which indicated that NOW is the right time to buy stocks in Zimbabwe. It had an in-depth analysis of the current situation and how it's likely going to change
3678 2018-12-20 06:45:02 - Stocks and U.S. futures tumbled in Asia, with Japanese equities sliding into a bear market as investors expressed concern about a lack of relief from the Federal Reserve’s monetary tightening.
3679 2018-12-20 06:44:48 Nifty declined over 0.5% on account of profit booking. Weak global cues pulled down market. However, mid-cap and small cap Index are in the green. Nifty 500 stocks advance decline ratio 1:1.2.  #MOMarketUpdates

3681 2018-12-20 06:44:31 I’ll believe the withdrawal of troops when it happens. He’s walked back or caved on policy before. There’s been much criticism of the criminal reform bill. Bump stocks barely scratch the surface for reasonable gun regulation. I guess it’s a low bar.
3682 2018-12-20 06:43:05 true, crypto is just more fluffy and leasable at the same time, like a candy for a 3-yo boy. So, people love to play with shitcoins more than with metal mining stocks
3683 2018-12-20 06:42:18 We’re bump stocks a problem when Obama was pres? I don’t remember hearing about them before the Vegas shooting.

3689 2018-12-20 06:37:48 I think the thought process of @contrarianEPS wasn't that these were bad stocks but these were bad stocks at current valuations. 2009 - 2013, most of them were pretty cheap
3690 2018-12-20 06:37:48 I hate to think of the Ma n Pa investors putting all into stocks, believing his every word.

Some will say they deserve to lose their life savings, but put yourself in their position.  Ok, we know they were wrong, but they didn't.  And they've lost it all.

That's horrible.
3691 2018-12-20 06:37:13 Bump Stocks are not guns. I fully support the 2nd amendment, and own many guns myself, but agree that these should not be legal (easily accessible).
3692 2018-12-20 06:36:31 yea I know. If you want some big risk reward play even precious metal mining stocks can give some very nice swings since they are like leveraged plays on the PMs they are mining.
3693 2018-12-20 06:35:58 Remember, bump stocks did not come into real focus until after the Las Vegas shooting. That came under Trump and he didn't move on this without pressure.
3694 2018-12-20 06:35:38 Toukiden is the only variation of a monster hunter game that I like. Very captivating storydevelopment. Create new weapons from monster parts that  don't break. Instead have to be a bit strategic with the use of your magic skills. 10 recovery stocks per mission.

3697 2018-12-20 06:33:47 That's the index for the mining companies if I am not mistaken, and, e.g. as oppose to gold, $URA may tank with the stocks, while precious metals could be a safe haven. So, yeah, unclear. I would give it a try though, I invest in crypto, so I got use to take huge risk, you know
3698 2018-12-20 06:33:39 The @bse_sensex and @buzzfeednifty closed higher in trade yesterday led by a rally in banking and auto stocks. Global markets were mostly higher ahead of an expected rate hike by Federal Reserve  #IACCAlert #Sensex #GlobalMarkets #Banking #Autostocks

3703 2018-12-20 06:31:44 We know bump stocks are toys but it is the opportunity to TAKE A STAND!   What will your opinion be when they use this rule to TRY to eliminate semi-auto rifles.  This is NOT a home defense issue it is a National Defense issue.  AND an issue of FREEDOM
3704 2018-12-20 06:30:09 I understand the argument about must not be infringed, but bump stocks are an easy throw away. They are a losing battle with the fast majority of people and fighting for something that is basically worthless is a losing battle.

3727 2018-12-20 06:14:24 Mid day Update (20 Dec):- Key indices cut some losses in mid-morning trade. Sensex down 176 points 36,307. Nifty down 58 points at 10,909. Metal and mining stocks declined. Profit booking after seven straight days of gains and negative Asian stocks weighed on the sentiment.
3728 2018-12-20 06:14:05 "This blows my mind: House Ethics Rules prevent me from receiving a $100 gift card, or crashing at a place as I wait for rent , but somehow allow members w/ investment portfolios to write laws that will personally enrich them $1000s in their own stocks; potentially millions."
3729 2018-12-20 06:13:39 S&P100 stocks above 200DMA today was 23%.  Feb2016 it was 20%.  Jan 2016 it was about 18%...

3731 2018-12-20 06:13:28 Stocks slide as Banksy's 2019 rates guidance disappoints
3732 2018-12-20 06:13:07 Given that the downturn is led by tech stocks, which don't make significant profits in the near turn, it's unlikely that the market decline had much direct impact on gdp, which defines recessions.
3733 2018-12-20 06:13:01 @realDonaldTrump I do not understand your views on bump stocks. First you said they were okay and then you change your mind the opposite direction. I do not own a bump stock. To me they are a gimmick. You cannot betray gunowners this way.
3734 2018-12-20 06:12:57 It must be fun to be a senator and bet on stocks that you influence through legislation
3735 2018-12-20 06:11:26 you can use stocks to create art, but should be original
3736 2018-12-20 06:10:24 Bump stocks look gross
3737 2018-12-20 06:09:52 it is the index that comes out of the woods first then stocks #my2c
3738 2018-12-20 06:09:37 Bump stocks are for ignorant people that don't understand weapons. They are useless
3739 2018-12-20 06:09:01 Watching all these MAGA folks making excuses for banning bump stocks goes to show how little principle exists within that wing of the Republican Party - 4D chess looks a lot like gun control
3740 2018-12-20 06:08:08 Chinese big-cap stocks are slumping.
The SSE50 index which tracks the 50 biggest stocks listed in Shanghai is down 1.7% to hit the LOWEST since May 2017.
3741 2018-12-20 06:07:30 This morning in Asia, stocks trade in negative territory, with the scorecard being as follows: Nikkei 225 (-3.10%), Hang Seng (-1.27%) and Shanghai Composite (-0.82%).

In the US futures are negative while Tencent is lower by 0.20% while BHP Billiton in Sydney has shed 1.70%.
3742 2018-12-20 06:07:23 I agree with laws that allow for due process and do not deprive law abiding citizens of property that was legally acquired. This bump stock ban turns what were law abiding citizens into felons if bump stocks are not destroyed or turned in to an ATF office at the owners expense
3743 2018-12-20 06:07:14 Morningstar’s Sonia Vora believes that global cosmetics mkt will grow >4% over next 5 yrs, comparable to levels over prior 5 yrs. Sales of L'Oréal, Estee Lauder, Shiseido shld grow even more. Pity women in India can't invest in such stocks, despite buying their products
3744 2018-12-20 06:07:01 PROUD NRA Family & Agree! IF you want a Full Auto Weapon then it will happen.  But NO need for Bump Stocks...PERIOD! It's like handing a Beer & Race Car to a Teen with a Permit License! Lol! I BELIEVE IN 2A! Our FF didnt Invision Bump Stocks tho! Cause? NO NEED! #WWG1WGA 
3745 2018-12-20 06:06:35 Today stocks tumble; EUR/USD 1.139; bund yield 0.24%; 10-year Treasury 2.77%; brent $56.6; gold $1244.8

3748 2018-12-20 06:03:02 Stocks tumble as Fed's outlook on rates disappoints
3749 2018-12-20 06:01:46 Take Ted Cruz for instance.

In Texas, the state legislature could pass a law that bans bump stocks, but Ted Cruz would go to D.C. and vote against a federal law that bans bump stocks.

Is Ted Cruz really serving the people of Texas when he does stuff like that?

3755 2018-12-20 05:56:15 Bump stocks shoudn't be made illegal as they are accessories rather than firearms (the tack DOiJ is taking). Once you allow regulation of accessories through simple changes in regulatory language to fit a political narrative, where does it end?

3764 2018-12-20 05:49:04 Personally, I had never heard of bump stocks before the shooting in Las Vegas. That was when most of us saw, firsthand, how dangerous they can be.

If in doubt, sell small portions to average up.
3781 2018-12-20 05:38:12 I never even HEARD of bump stocks until Vegas.

3785 2018-12-20 05:37:00 True I have been scaling out since Septmber when my pf hit an all time high. I am looking at resouce stocks too but think it may take a while. I dont mind being late to the party just need confirmation we are not going lower.
3786 2018-12-20 05:36:19 If this is their sales pitch i don't want to see their stocks for the next few years bc they're clearly struggling if they have nothing but youtube views to back up a wholeass company. Are they youtubers or an entertainment agency????

3790 2018-12-20 05:33:15 Could be the politics changed since Obama especially after Vegas massacre when bump stocks were used highly deadly effectively. This actually shows how grass root orgs like Mom Demand, Giffords & Parkland teens are REALLY making a difference. Yea for America growing up!
3791 2018-12-20 05:33:06 JK Tyre one of the Emerging Stocks of 2019
3792 2018-12-20 05:31:12 2A is a straw man.  Even Scalia wrote that right to bear arms is not an absolute right.  If you want bump stocks, then you need to argue on the merits and allow our democratic process to work.  What is your argument in favor of bump stocks?
3793 2018-12-20 05:31:02 Cuz I am tired of being a populist & not getting anywhere...no walls & no bump stocks.

At this point lets just tax the poor and middle class & go start a bunch of foreign wars...& oh yeah...lets spend alot too and ill need to buy some votes.

This is how this works right?
3794 2018-12-20 05:30:21 It's a juggle fraud for sure, but technically not a ponzi. Not that it matters. You see this all the time in penny stocks.
3795 2018-12-20 05:30:14 I agree, only someone that dont want to hit their target would get one. But that is not the issue, another step towards the banning of guns has been taken. Here in Sweden they are trying to get folding stocks banned for hunting rifles, since it can be more easily used by ->
3796 2018-12-20 05:30:06 Can't wait till March. Hopefully the market is down so I can sell these stocks
3797 2018-12-20 05:29:36 I’m military and never heard of them. On top of it, you lose control of aim, unless you are firing into a crown of concert goes from a high rise. The bump stocks are a POS. Big issue is, they can be made in your garage.
3798 2018-12-20 05:28:54 I never heard of bump stocks until the Las Vegas killings. So, trump. Another EO. BFD
3799 2018-12-20 05:27:05 I was waiting for Democrats to rally in New York for bump stocks now that trump banned them!!!
3800 2018-12-20 05:26:30 Brokerage Link in Fidelity allows you to trade stocks. I have 50% cash there and short or go long and play options. Suggestion but I know what you’re saying. Tough. Remember what I said. Came to know about a chunk of folks retiring early 2019. Really sad if not I cash component.
3801 2018-12-20 05:26:21 If they wanna confiscate bump stocks or any firearms, why don't they start with the Liberal Hollywood groups? They're the ones saying we would be much better off without having any guns. #TrueStory #2A 
3802 2018-12-20 05:26:18 If you don't know anything about the market stay out.   Who says you have to be in stocks in your 401k.  How you can be down is impossible.   The Dow is up 28% since the election.  You need a financial adviser.
3803 2018-12-20 05:26:13 Apare tlt tou have never lived through or studied hyper inflation. If you were buying stocks up 300% in the last 10 years you were being naive.
3804 2018-12-20 05:26:12 U.S. stocks declined sharply on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve's forecast of fewer interest-rate increases in 2019 fell short of investors' hopes of a more dovish monetary policy.
3805 2018-12-20 05:26:01 Doesnt bother me tbh. Markets dont always agree but in time fundamentally strong stocks eventually have an accurate valuation through their sp
3806 2018-12-20 05:25:44 Relax Ted, I think a few holders saying that his own agenda (selling all resource stocks) came across a little in the interview is hardly a witch hunt, just observations. Economics for #ARS speak for themselves though and LTHs are using this dip to increase and average down.
3807 2018-12-20 05:25:08 “I don’t care if the ring my man gives me is cheap, But I want at least $5,000 in stocks.”

3811 2018-12-20 05:23:31 Bump Stocks aren't needed and in fact are dangerous because of the nature of their operation. Bump Stocks are a red herring that really don't even warrant a tweet. Banning them isn't gun control as much as it is for the safety of the individual.
3812 2018-12-20 05:23:19 Please. Obama was President during Sandy Hook. I don’t remember “bump stocks” being an issue until Vegas. If you’re not into guns,you don’t know those details. He fought hard for legislation. The more he fought,the harder he was opposed.He increased funding for mental health care
3813 2018-12-20 05:23:16 I am a record profits-there stocks would qualify as possible
3814 2018-12-20 05:22:32 Ok fella, chill I agree law through legislative body, I am suggesting the better answer is to through legislation regulate bump stocks like their older brothers the selectable automatic rifles.  Executive, or judicial fiat is not in section 1 2 or 3 of our constitution,
3815 2018-12-20 05:21:58 He's not hiding cuz he knows its a matter of day or weeks before he has to go.  He is pulling a fast job on us. Like his 5 bankruptcies. Every day now big things. Nancy will be fine as prez. Cuz pence it seems is in muellers sights. We are in for it China's stocks are down too..
3816 2018-12-20 05:21:20 Play to not get grabbed, zone him out, exploit his trash recovery. This game plays with 3 stocks so there’s more opportunities to play around it. It’s not broken if there’s legitimate counterplay and the character has glaring weaknesses.
3817 2018-12-20 05:21:04 why not bring back the tradition of wrongdoers locked into stocks in the public square?
3818 2018-12-20 05:20:41 Mmmm..... I’m a little pissed about that as well. Banning bump stocks didn’t help his cause either.
3819 2018-12-20 05:20:15 Bumps stocks cover for Vegas, Syria...Trumps killing foreign policy & Damascus Christmas seems better than ours, but I'll take Military Wall
3820 2018-12-20 05:19:40 A Cong govt will ensure cooperation from all govt departments. I got into stocks because I was sick of local politics in my city. 

Politics never really leaves money I guess.
3821 2018-12-20 05:19:36 Maybe you could build it out of recycled Bump-stocks. And maybe some paper mache decorations made from our 2nd Ammendment rights
3822 2018-12-20 05:18:59 They stuck it to you. This FED is off the deepend insane. Nobody in their right mind should be so stubborn to raise interest rates during a market crash. Worst December since Great Depression in stocks. Fire this guy.
3823 2018-12-20 05:17:42 Lol, in this market quality Li stocks are crashing and you suggest AVZ 
3824 2018-12-20 05:17:37 Bump stocks are stupid. Real gunners don’t waste time with that gimmicky crap
3825 2018-12-20 05:17:28 People crying about bump stocks remind me of Liberals... This was already talked about and if people absolutely have to have a bump stock then I feel sorry for you... People can shoot a pump shotgun just as fast as a person shooting a semi-auto shotgun...

3827 2018-12-20 05:15:58 So where do stocks go now? Likely plunging big time. Value stocks here are all buy and many have dividends so we just have to wait it out. Cash is king...likely best place for money at moment. Trade War resolution is only thing I see driving market higher. Sad day. Sad #Fed.
3828 2018-12-20 05:15:40 I’m not gonna go to college for 4+ years just to work for some dumbass who knows how to play with stocks.
3829 2018-12-20 05:15:29 Oh please. Bump stocks are now controlled as NFA items. There isn’t any ‘grab’ to be had. A reasonable pro-2A adult can see that.
3830 2018-12-20 05:15:04 How you gonna use a tragedy as a means to obtain bump stocks, especially if they're from law abiding gun owners? No, something isn't right with this.
3831 2018-12-20 05:12:13 A. Bump Stocks were not really known or used in the Obama years.
B. You should already know that Obama had the Republican run congress against him and blocked many things he wanted done.
3832 2018-12-20 05:11:28 This reminds me a lot of late 2015. Rate hikes and volatile markets, cheap oil and slowing demand. I remember a lot of precious metal stocks going 5x starting in February...
3833 2018-12-20 05:11:26 Trump should stop trying to influence the Fed.  They are independent.

And I am a DJT supporter...  The markets have been going up on ether (10 tech stocks like FAANG stks  

This correction (-10%) or bear market (-20%) are a good thing.  

We will be able to buy much lower. 
3834 2018-12-20 05:10:50 Bump stocks are pretty worth less I agree with you on that but you give these dims a inch and they take 20 miles they have Ben doing this for 30 years some where we have to draw a line in the sand and say enough and quite giving anymore of your rights up that’s where I stand

Reliance 2123.10 is one such case.! 10:31

3850 2018-12-20 05:01:53 #Stocks in the #news: Pfizer, Om Metals, Thomas Cook, Alembic Pharma, Canara Bank, Religare Enterprises
3851 2018-12-20 05:01:35 @POTUS very disappointed in your #CriminalJusticeReform and banning of bump stocks. Also disappointed in your lack of building the wall. Why did we elect you again? So we could have more criminals on the streets, gun bans, & no immigration policy
3852 2018-12-20 05:01:34 The only reason why the stock market is not down 30% (like $AAPL) is the fact that a lot money has been hiding in defensive stocks like $MCD, $SBUX  and $CLX, which are actually up for the year! Don’t worry, they will now catch up to the rest of the market on the downside.
3853 2018-12-20 05:00:26 There is no way you're going to convince me this environment is bubble territory. Bubbles have a lot of enthusiasm and grossly overpriced stocks. P/Es for the average company are too low to be considered bubble or even close. Earnings growth is high too and liquidity plentiful.
3854 2018-12-20 05:00:15 *Slows down, deep breath* You're right...This is no time to lose my head. I'd just rather not be put in the stocks by Lyse.
3855 2018-12-20 05:00:01 Bump stocks officially banned by trump administration. #MAGA
Take that Obamma!
3856 2018-12-20 04:58:57 If we rebrand 'bump stocks' to 'Trump stocks', do you think he would reverse the order banning them? Appeal to his ego seems like a solid play.
3857 2018-12-20 04:58:34 If bump stocks turned semi-autos into "machine guns" (as the media alleges), why would criminal organizations and cartels continue to pay so much for automatic weapons? Just take grandpa's deer rifle, add a bump stock, and go to war! Right?
3858 2018-12-20 04:57:52 row no K for CRi % (current risk involve % from current lvl) so that's y i prefer long call in this stock bcoz trend is to buy as per my eod data but now its near support zone so with low risk u can make good gain.... other 2 stocks... BajajHolding & HdfcLife....
3859 2018-12-20 04:57:14 Boscastle pies are my favourite since the grocery store near my house stocks them. Their Moroccan Lamb pie is my fave :p
3860 2018-12-20 04:57:06 EVERYONE should call their brokers and demand that they dont include any of these ticking time bmbs that could cost you your retirement funds once they go up in flames. Your 401K & others normally consists of a "basket" of various mixed stocks. Make sure they dont include these
3861 2018-12-20 04:55:55 Like a gambler saying he won $1000 on slots. He hit 1000, but poured in 1500. That's not an increase. The markets didnt INCREASE under Obama. They merely came back a bit, but they were still under water.  I sold my stocks anticipating the election & tax reasons in Oct. - Normal.
3862 2018-12-20 04:55:35 I want some Birkin stocks
3863 2018-12-20 04:54:03 Want to know about the sugar stocks triveni and dwarikesh future
3864 2018-12-20 04:54:01 It's not a bad sign. It weeds out those who are actually supposed to be here, and/or can last. I talked about this literally in January. That we would spend the next year weeding out everyone. In btc, in stocks, in gld etc.
3865 2018-12-20 04:53:34 Your right to bear arms isn’t infringed by the bump stock ban. Bump stocks aren’t guns. Simple as that.
3866 2018-12-20 04:53:14 This action appears to be right out of the Obama playbook - but surprisingly it's from Trump's. I have no dog in the fight regarding bump stocks, but the gov't should buy existing devices so as not to be a 'taking' and not turn otherwise lawful owners into criminals overnight.
3867 2018-12-20 04:52:55 @premierepastime @larryelder respectfully disagree: ban bump stocks=good, pull out of Syria=bad, prison reform=not sure yet (gotta read more on it)..I want a wall, thus here’s my ??.. 1040 forms have a POTUS re-elect.. could those funds be redelegated? Jw..

3872 2018-12-20 04:51:48 Let the SURGE in tax harvesting begin into Y/E!..Many stocks can be sold to recog losses for tax purposes and then rebought after 30 days!!
3873 2018-12-20 04:51:33 Trump banning bump stocks is bigger news than it’s getting. Fox won’t report it because it’s way too liberal of a move & MSNBC won’t talk about it because they hate him...
3874 2018-12-20 04:51:26 You are a brain dead person that does not know anything about bump stocks, it was only one incident.  What about all the cars that kill more then guns do, what you should do is make a law that bans black men from stealing white mens guns. The white men went through the check!

3877 2018-12-20 04:50:25 Hooray!  Finally accomplished something.  This plus the bump stocks makes me think trumpy can top the over/under of 3.5 things he'll do well in 4 tears of presidency (if it lasts that long...you know what I mean.  #ConManDonnyBoy
3878 2018-12-20 04:50:01 How is it completely useless? Bump stocks are what allowed the Las Vegas shooter to kill in such high numbers
3879 2018-12-20 04:49:15 I am surprised to see non performance of logistic stocks which are direct beneficiary of soft crude prices just like Aviation sector...most of the mid-cap small caps from this sector trading near historic lows.

3883 2018-12-20 04:47:45 Disappointed that the bump stocks are gonna be banned now //:
3884 2018-12-20 04:47:23 it seems like a company of decent success is venturing into the entertainment industry for the first time & their first step is to buy all SKE stocks from AKS

it seems like Akip jumped from AKS to that new group too or something? hilarious if true www
3885 2018-12-20 04:46:51 Suddenly he's doing the right thing: banning bump stocks, changing policy of sharing fingerprints of potential sponsors with ICE, for whatever reason, it stinks of distraction and obfuscation. More KGB playbook. Why give him credit? It's obviously self serving!
3886 2018-12-20 04:45:44 As far as I know. That is no law on bump stocks
3887 2018-12-20 04:45:42 Fertilisers(on hopes of good fertiliser sales after loan waivers) and HFCs (on eased liquidity concerns & expectations of Housing sector friendly announcement from forthcoming GST Council meet) looking best performers in today's trade so far.

3891 2018-12-20 04:43:46 So ridiculous! Makes no sense what-so-ever. Bump stocks are not guns of any kind
3892 2018-12-20 04:43:43 What you have is one bump stocks incident, and you ban them all.  We should ban cars they have killed more then 58 people, we should also ban stupid people who do not know what they are talking about!
3893 2018-12-20 04:43:00 I don’t defend terrorists who need bump stocks to feel safe.
3894 2018-12-20 04:42:59 Anything NPR. Planet Money is a great one about economics for people who get confused by stocks and finances (like me lol). Hidden Brain is about cool scientific discoveries. 1A is about issues related to free speech. Invisibilia is also awesome, its a storytelling one.
3895 2018-12-20 04:42:29 I will be first to admit never ever thought certain #Lithium #Li $ASX #stocks would fall to these levels with current #EV #storage #energy #world #disruption taking place right in front of our eyes !!

#fundamentals only one Li stock for me that will come good !!
3896 2018-12-20 04:42:12 Look at all the weak #MAGA here...

disagree strongly...#AmericaFirst is def get out of Syria...and Prison Reform is good, Americans are locked up for a lot of BS

Bump Stocks? meh
3897 2018-12-20 04:41:44 Yessss! That's what I'm expecting tbh. Kind of a wild stock though so who knows. If i could invest in foreign stocks right now I'd totally bet on it.
3898 2018-12-20 04:41:35 I told you. He's a follower of Mondale-ism like most rich New Yorkers of his era. And the NRA came out and pretty much hinted that they'd throw bump stocks to the alligator to save AR-15s and semi autos or avoid magazine limits.
3899 2018-12-20 04:41:11 the other day I ran into a ganon who was trying to do wavedashes in between stocks and knew how to actually move and we had a good few games, it was the most fun I've had in quickplay so far because it was the only time the opponent didn't play like a zero-fundies smash4 player

3903 2018-12-20 04:40:07 Is this why stocks are falling. Big business can't do good bonuses because of stock market?  Anxious to see market in February.
3904 2018-12-20 04:39:53 Don’t buy stocks right now. Wait for the correction
3905 2018-12-20 04:39:49 At this point there’s no doubt, I’m going to sell off all my stocks and reinvest all of the money into golden showers @PeterSchiff @nickmullen #aintnothinwrongwithalittlepee
3906 2018-12-20 04:39:43 Yep, with volume of less than 2% of the company the stock is down 30% in the past few days. That’s the problem with illiquid stocks
3907 2018-12-20 04:39:28 Bump stocks are not a second Amendment issue. Something that allows a semiautomatic to function as an illegal fully automatic should be banned. Full automatic weapons are banned except by special permits
3908 2018-12-20 04:38:40 It's a shame govt's involved so much in the private sector that when the President changes party stocks rise & fall bc of it. One party supports certain industries & the other different ones!
3909 2018-12-20 04:37:47 In the mid 90s, you could close your eyes, throw a dart at a wall with ticker symbols to pick your stocks, and make shit tons of money....as long as DJT wasnt on the board

3912 2018-12-20 04:37:07 Nah but it’s like watching stocks. You fuck around and pay 40 bucks over one day and the next it’s 20 bucks less
3913 2018-12-20 04:36:43 why must you deal in "what ifs"? I don't agree that there isn't a buy back in place. that sux. but that being said, IT (Bump Stocks) is not about the 2A. don't mix and match. that is a very liberal trait. they have been doing it forever. lets just face facts. BS's are not needed
3914 2018-12-20 04:36:26 The left asks when @realDonaldTrump supporters will find fault- the A: this week. Pulling out of Syria is a huge mistake, and banning bump stocks is a slap in the face to #2a supporters.

3916 2018-12-20 04:35:25 I am referring to oil related stocks
3917 2018-12-20 04:34:46 This may be a dumb question but... How long have bump stocks been on the market?
IDK if bump stocks were available, can't ban something that wasn't available.
3918 2018-12-20 04:33:57 Bump stocks are such a minimal issue
3919 2018-12-20 04:33:57 With crude oil down to very low levels, turn by turn different chemical stocks will pick up we have Deepak, thirumalai and now today taken ig petro... #nse
3920 2018-12-20 04:33:44 She could be an anomaly...all stocks aren't the same and don't react the same under market conditions...it's entirely possible, if not likely, she did well under #44.  That said, non investors (401K holders) are clearly winning under DJT.  This is good for The People!!
3921 2018-12-20 04:32:07 So let me get this straight,  the smart way to do it is to abandon the 1st President with balls in over 3 decades because he doesn't make all of our dreams come true? You people are fake and weak. This battle can be won, go bury your heads in the sand with your bump stocks
3922 2018-12-20 04:31:58 Is Trump deliberatly doing things to drive stock prices down so he or someone can just on a certain bunch of stocks at a low price than he changes his game plan prices on stocks suddenly rise & him or associates sell at hire prices. All this without his knowledge of course.

3926 2018-12-20 04:30:37 I must look in to seeing if it's possible to get shares in both tin foil and milliner stocks....
3927 2018-12-20 04:30:10 Maybe I’m missing something here but isn’t banning bump stocks a good thing ?
3928 2018-12-20 04:29:31 stocks is the move all 2019 bet
3929 2018-12-20 04:29:23 Communication is tough, but a necessity.  Imagine buying stocks on the market and not having the ability to check in on them.  The biggest downfall (aside from marketing) is the fact that there is very little in the form of technology. Especially with 1 click billing, etc.
3930 2018-12-20 04:29:17 Bump stocks are silly toys. Any decent shot could take out more targets with aimed singles in semiauto. Let's pick our battles, this is not such a bad sacrificial lamb.
3931 2018-12-20 04:29:05 the rate increases have spiked volatility in stocks but that hasn't "left a mark on the economy " as Powell said. Success favors the prepared mind and ya'll should have taken precautions. Gone to cash in the summer and load up on PUTs. #fed
3932 2018-12-20 04:28:41 Banning bump stocks won’t do shit, just saying. 99% of Americans don’t even know what they are or how they work including the “politicians” who voted to ban them.
3933 2018-12-20 04:28:23 Bump Stocks are not arms

3942 2018-12-20 04:26:24 Not yet, but you most definitely will be handing over any bump stocks you may own to the gov. Otherwise that thin blue line will come and confiscate them for you. 
3943 2018-12-20 04:25:49 Why would a rate hike draw people into stocks? The hike should draw them into bonds. Housing is weak as well so not a ton of demand for mortgages and equity loans.

3955 2018-12-20 04:21:58 Ur wrong. Has done nothing. Only appointing judges and a tax cut for the 1 percent. Nothing else. Economy is a referendum on Obama.But now the economy and stocks are tanking.  That is not success. Has more law suits and investigations than accomplishments
3956 2018-12-20 04:21:50 Most of EAs profit comes from In-game purchases... If less fifa points are being bought cause less people are playing, it will definitely effect stocks when profit reports come out. To claim there’s no correlation is simply stupid.
3957 2018-12-20 04:21:47 This is lame. Bump stocks are not the reason some crazy asshole shot up vegas. In fact does anyone else want to know the real story on that incident and not the horse shit they selling us in the media?
3958 2018-12-20 04:20:16 Nobody is gonna take your damn guns. In 8 years Obama banned exactly zero firearms. Your orange hero just banned bump stocks.

3967 2018-12-20 04:17:53 I was scared when "everyone" was excited. Now that they're terrified, I'm getting interested in stocks again. Just bought some FZROX - like I do every month.
3968 2018-12-20 04:17:37 Bump stocks ruin your gun barrels.  They are not forged for the heat.  I don’t care about that.
3969 2018-12-20 04:17:34 Since when does the DOJ make laws? Bump stocks have nothing to do with the definition of machine guns. If they want this changed, they can lobby congress to change it. One squeeze of trigger, one fired cartridge. The NFA registry should be a wake up call to all Americans.
3970 2018-12-20 04:16:58 People sell for many many reasons. I would like to know, what is the short interest? Is there a way to ACCURATELY get that number on a daily basis for stocks on the NYSE American? - Want to know the chance of a short squeeze.

3972 2018-12-20 04:16:08 Thai stocks index opened at 1,592..69, down 8.43 pts; local gold bar unchanged from Wednesday closing: Bt19,250 (buy), Bt19,350 (sell)
3973 2018-12-20 04:16:06 So be it if they’re unhappy imo. I live in a country with pretty strict gun laws and am all for gun ownership. I grew up hunting, law enforcement is a huge part of my life, bump stocks have no part in any of that.
3974 2018-12-20 04:15:31 Oh calm down.  I’m a Conservative right winger w a conceal carry.  No need for bump stocks
3975 2018-12-20 04:15:12 I feel bad for myself and the few thousand I have in stocks...but not for his buddies
3976 2018-12-20 04:15:00 People are like stocks, their value will either increase or decrease your worth so take note of who you place around you
3977 2018-12-20 04:14:57 Why is it bad to ban bump stocks?
3978 2018-12-20 04:14:38 Don't care about bump stocks. The elastic band from my broccoli that my wife makes me eat works just as well...
3979 2018-12-20 04:14:33 Where did the constitution give us the right to bump stocks? We have the right to bare arms, they say nothing about gun accessories or modifications
3980 2018-12-20 04:14:07 My pretty liberal cousin disagreed with the descision to ban stocks says it doesnt make guns mimic being automatic but yes they do????
3981 2018-12-20 04:13:36 Cuomo's stupidity.....we have plenty of time to build the wall......and my stocks have nearly doubled.....ISIS owned Syria during Osama's reign....and this Russia crap is just that.

3987 2018-12-20 04:11:08 Growing calls for rate cut in 2019, earlier Bofa called for a 25 bps in Feb, today Kotak says 50bps possible in H1 of 2019..how many rate cuts do you expect in the current environment (macro+ new Guv+slower global growth) in 2019. (rates&stocks have a great relationship)
3988 2018-12-20 04:10:24 The reason I have no problem with getting rid of them, is that fully automatic weapons are hard to aim, however bumpmstocks are easier to aim due to the change in the center point of gravity. 

It’s all about control and bump stocks are easier to control.
3989 2018-12-20 04:10:16 Statistics available. See Kushner family selling H5B visas in China. Real estate holdings. Russian conglomerates buying US stocks. Japanese Holdings own Sprint. Etc
3990 2018-12-20 04:10:16 Because what happened in Las Vegas wasn’t an awful thing  bump stocks also throw off the accuracy of your shot, so I’m not sure why anyone would be upset these are now banned.

3996 2018-12-20 04:08:52 Still waiting on your proof, or statistics that support your statement where you state " fire rate, so yes, bump stocks and high capacity magazines increase their likelihood" there have only been two use of one automatic weapon in the use since the 60's and
3997 2018-12-20 04:07:30 Perhaps I should invest in some Home Depot stocks?
3998 2018-12-20 04:07:00 I feel like it shouldn’t be. It’s a loophole around full auto fire. They should be allowed if you have full auto permits. Otherwise what is the point of restricting full auto? I’m a big 2A advocate but bump stocks poked a hole in the full auto permit system we have

"That 'sniper scope' makes the gun more deadly, like bump stocks, no citizen needs that! Only our military needs those!"

I can hear it now. And you're going to let it happen.

Shameful.

4003 2018-12-20 04:04:36 We both know from beginning the real man behind it. It was great plan to stop winning Ballon D'OR but didn't work. Juve stocks are still increasing and no sponsorships are terminated.
It's nothing new that Portuguese media claims about that old donkey ass.
4004 2018-12-20 04:04:16 Can’t relate...I don’t lose stocks
4005 2018-12-20 04:03:26 Investors should ask themselves. Where is the money flowing/fleeing to? Answers: gold, cash & debt. Where will they flow next.... back into stocks and commodities once fear abates. When? Fed tone changes more dovish, when Trump is impeached/replaced and when wars fizzle.
4006 2018-12-20 04:03:07 Sorry for your loss. RIP Poor bump stocks.
4007 2018-12-20 04:03:07 That’s what you think. It’s a slippery slope to total gun confiscation. That’s how many countries have achieved their goal of total gun confiscation from law abiding ppl. Yes, it’s being challenged, but even Kavanaugh has said bump stocks aren’t covered under 2A, they’re not guns

4020 2018-12-20 04:00:25 Agreed but these people that have these bump stocks honestly shouldn’t have them, they’re honestly useless, you’re never going to own a fully automatic rifle unless you join the service and even then you don’t own it you just have the PRIVILEGE of firing it.

4026 2018-12-20 03:59:35 BUMP STOCKS ARE AN ACCESSORY AND THEY JUST BANNED IT.

TELL ME YOU TRUST OUR GOVERNMENT NOT TO DO THE SAME WITH ALL OTHER ACCESSORIES!?!?

4028 2018-12-20 03:59:25 Less about the bump stocks and more about the principle. Slippery slope works this way. "Who cares, it's an ammo waster and bad on your gun." okay. "I mean I can do just as well with a 10 round magazine as a 30." w-wai- "Do we REALLY need semi-autos???" HOLD ON A FU
4029 2018-12-20 03:59:21 This was coming anyway. Under the guidelines of the assault weapons ban, bump stocks were technically a huge loophole.

4038 2018-12-20 03:57:21 Bump stocks are an accessory, We shouldn’t have been in Syria, he said he will get it done and he is taking care of families during Xmas time, prison reform allows for better rehabilitation of non violent offenders.   Great week Mr. President.
4039 2018-12-20 03:57:21 Syria: Need to know if it is part of a bigger ME play. Wall: Probably handing the wall/fence decision off to engineers and finding a budget. Aid: Smart people say it is smart. Bump stocks are the whoopee cushions of guns. Didn't NRA say ban them?

4041 2018-12-20 03:57:09 True. Either way, with what's going on with bump stocks I wouldn't be surprised if other things get rolled back.

4044 2018-12-20 03:56:23 1) Pulling out of Syria;
2) Illogically banning bump stocks;
3) Demanding the Fed not increase rate (and failing);
4) Caving on $5B border wall funding demand;
5) Prioritizing prison reform.

It's only Wednesday, but this is a helluva bad week so far, Mr. President.
4045 2018-12-20 03:56:19 We agree on a lot, but I actually don’t have a problem with getting rid of bump stocks.
4046 2018-12-20 03:56:11 Market stocks and shit aside. Fifa 19s gameplay is worse than fifa 18s.
4047 2018-12-20 03:55:44 Lol, that comparison is ridiculous. Bump stocks aren't tanks. And please with the "you dont need" nonsense. I don't care what you feel other people need as much as, I hope, you dont care what I feel is "needed" for you. (1)

4053 2018-12-20 03:53:11 Yes ban bump stocks bc that’s what killed those people not the man pulling the trigger. Remember those stocks were approved by the ATF, idiots all of you.
4054 2018-12-20 03:50:34 Well, considering that bump stocks do not affect any gun-wielder's ability to make the bullets come out the shooty end, I fail to see what banning them will accomplish in terms of crime or violence.

Seriously, what's this ban do for anyone, besides advance an agenda?
4055 2018-12-20 03:50:06 Bump stocks are just plain stupid.  Only knuckleheads who like to skirt the laws already in place, and pretend they are in a zombie video game think they are cool. Even the military understands that aiming and shot control is more important.

4064 2018-12-20 03:45:05 True. It’s just sick that bullying someone is not enough, now these a-holes are proud so they record their actions thinking they will embarrass victim further. In reality they embarrass themselves, family, friends, school & community. They should bring back stocks as punishment.
4065 2018-12-20 03:44:50 And stocks traditionally rally in December.
4066 2018-12-20 03:44:45 Exactly, it’s an accessory, so where does it stop?  They are reclassifying bump stocks as machine guns. If they can change definitions on a whim there’s nothing they can’t rule illegal.
4067 2018-12-20 03:44:43 @deniseberube RT @themotleyfool: The stock market falls 20%, on average, every 4 years.
We're only a few percentage points away from there.
That's the bad news.
Good news?
Historically, these represent among the greatest times in history to buy stocks for the very long term.

4072 2018-12-20 03:43:54 Bump stocks are to rifles what whoopee cushions are to chairs. I wouldn't advocate door-to-door confiscation. Not much to gain there. Sounds like it's more about restricting sales.
4073 2018-12-20 03:43:35 All suing current oil corporations will do is destroy the equity value of millions of investors, many of which are hard working Canadians whose RRSP mutual funds hold energy stocks.

4080 2018-12-20 03:40:53 Sure....nothing to see...just ignore worst global liquidity since ‘08, IG/HY spreads blowing out, collapsing inflation expectations and plummeting commodities, European demand , and China mess..But sure,
It’s “just about stocks going up”...
4081 2018-12-20 03:40:45 No wall and no bump stocks. You tired of winning yet?
4082 2018-12-20 03:40:32 Banning bump stocks are a gun part not a gun. Banning them did not fall under the remit of the AFTA "Not because they liked it, but because the law did not permit them to prohibit it," Winkler said. So best of luck Trump.
4083 2018-12-20 03:40:29 Trump is touting the Prison Reform bill but has made criminals of innocent people for possessing bump stocks. The Promise he made was not to infringe on 2nd amendments right yet that's precisely what he has done.

4086 2018-12-20 03:39:53 I don't care about "bump stocks". I oppose Pres. Trump banning them because "what about when the next President decides to ban other gun acc. because they think you shouldn't have it and if you don't destroy  it you're a felon". That's how a tyrant governs not a U.S. President.

4090 2018-12-20 03:39:14 You were doing a great job up until pulling this crap!  10.8 billion to Mexico, No WALL, and banning bump stocks from American Citizens! @realDonaldTrump
4091 2018-12-20 03:39:04 @realDonaldTrump For God sakes get a grip on being President stand up to deep state and stop giving into week Rep party and the Dems confiscation of Bump Stocks Really?
4092 2018-12-20 03:38:49 If Obama had used EO to outlaw bump stocks the GOP would have decried it and impeached him for presidenting while black.

4094 2018-12-20 03:38:15 The correlation between people who get offended by decorated coffee cups and gender-neutral cookies and people who don’t realize that the president they voted for is banning bump stocks must be pretty high

4100 2018-12-20 03:36:42 Bump stocks was a meaningless bone. You can make one out of a wire hanger if you really need one
4101 2018-12-20 03:35:55 As someone who thoroughly enjoys target shooting I will say bump stocks are the dumbest thing ever and never should have been legal. Not only does it make a semi auto gun fully automatic it's very impractical in target shooting. Using an ar-15 with a bump can empty a clip...cont
4102 2018-12-20 03:35:13 The vitriol towards you is real though, you touted buying Fang stocks for the past years without regard to their valuations and now many have gone broke or bust!! I hope you feel good about that!

4105 2018-12-20 03:33:06 I agree, she only cares because bump stocks were going to be the Trojan horse that she and the rest of the Dems where going to use to pass bigger, more restrictive laws
4106 2018-12-20 03:32:16 WTH? You signed an Executive order banning bump stocks and your not building the wall but sending Mexico 10.8 billion dollars? @realDonaldTrump

4108 2018-12-20 03:31:33 The LV shooter was a millionaire. He killed 58 people & injured over 400.  He killed himself.  He had 14 rifles with #BumpStocks. Is the penalty for the new #BumpStockBan severe enough to convince someone like him to turn in his bump stocks?  #nope #symbolic #2A

4110 2018-12-20 03:31:16 Why do y’all “need” bump stocks tho???
4111 2018-12-20 03:31:03 He just banned bump stocks. That’s something Obama didn’t do.
4112 2018-12-20 03:31:00 Prison reform, getting out of Syria and banning bump stocks (NRA approved idea) are good.  With the wall, we will have to see how things play out.  It is tough with McConnell and Ryan often ready to undermine everything Trump wants.
4113 2018-12-20 03:30:31 Since 2013, our family use to own a business and she sold it in 2013. She has more than just stocks. Just talked to her financial adviser and she said she would be ok due to the diversity of her portfolio.
4114 2018-12-20 03:30:19 i’m really glad! thank you for listening! boycotts are actually a huge thing for korean fans... look up elfs/super junior lol. they bought stocks in sm to get sm to sign a contract with them over their demand (from what i understand)
4115 2018-12-20 03:30:11 I saw the layoffs did not see the healthcare increases.  Eeeesh.  Time to hunker down.  Wifes portfolio is 72% cash right now and I am 80% cash.  Stocks are way too expensive atm
4116 2018-12-20 03:29:32 - Trump's DOJ pushes through an unconstitutional ban on bump stocks.

- Trump appears to blink on his signature political issue, the wall.

- Trump pulls USA out of Syria.
4117 2018-12-20 03:29:20 Obama passed two laws, neither of which did any restrictions on firearms. Trump will most likely sign this bill into action on the ban on sale and ownership of bump stocks as machine guns under the NFA. However Dems want it congressional Reps want it in ATF.
4118 2018-12-20 03:29:11 Don't agree.bump stocks R not needed by public. In fact I thought they were illegal. Syria is in a civil war. We have been training th Kurds 4 years. They've been trained & we need 2 leave. We need th wall. Fight 4 th wall. Prison reform: really scrutinize those being released
4119 2018-12-20 03:29:06 Don't obsess over Bump Stocks! Note Trump's intent to use the Military to build the Wall instead! Bump Stocks are dead already!
4120 2018-12-20 03:28:51 Madami pa daw stocks! 
4121 2018-12-20 03:28:32 Bump stocks were used in Las Vegas.  Trump was president.   I hadn’t heard of them until that time.  Most gun enthusiasts were probably aware of them especially those with mass murder on their mind.  There is no other reason for having them.
4122 2018-12-20 03:28:31 Bump stocks are meaningless. Syria is Trump jumping when Putin says “jump.” Prison reform is window dressing (gotta be private prison $ kickback in there somewhere)...

Bad week because he’s an incompetent asshole who’s under multiple criminal investigations. You forgot that...
4123 2018-12-20 03:27:59 Give me a break. Bump stocks were designed to circumvent the automatic weapons ban. Nothing to do with the 2A #ProudNRAMember
4124 2018-12-20 03:27:37 Because no one even thought about bump stocks back then. Most never heard of them until 'Vegas.

4133 2018-12-20 03:25:26 I say when full auto is legally available at my local gun store, we won't need those scary bump stocks
4134 2018-12-20 03:25:19 Who uses bump stocks anyway, so dumb. Just drone and air strikes in Syria are best. Prison reform good. We need a wall, Republican congressmen are to blame, not Trump.
4135 2018-12-20 03:25:07 How is banning bump stocks bad? Obama one that made them legal and i honestly think that was a bad idea and I'm pro 2A. Bump stocks turn weapons into machine guns which isn't good.
4136 2018-12-20 03:24:45 Obama took over during Great recession caused by GOP. Congress added emergency funding.Emergency Stimulus Act. Something positive,Not tax break for rich.Stagnant income.70% of USA don’t want the wall for multitude of reasons.Trump took over with positive growth Check stocks now!
4137 2018-12-20 03:24:42 Technically its a Good Break out on PSU Index and all Bank Stocks. Index Above 3200 may trigger more Rally and Buying also.
4138 2018-12-20 03:24:35 I hear you. Did you see that General Electric is cutting jobs and raising other employee’s medical? GM is doing the same after laying 15% of their workforce. This market is a straight sell market. We were in the deficit for the year in late October. Medical stocks were down 10%
4139 2018-12-20 03:23:44 It is clearly not a 2A issue.  Automatic rifles have been banned since the 80's. Never challenged in court.  In your telling, 2A is tyrannical...a barrier to democracy. Fortunately, no serious jurist believes 2A is absolute.  Make your argument on the merits of bump stocks
4140 2018-12-20 03:23:38 Waiting for you to resign as promised. Worst stocks since 1929.
4141 2018-12-20 03:23:29 @iamvishchauhan Sir I Have Been Following You Since Last One Month On Zee Business....Your Way Of Explaining Views On Nifty And Stocks Is Awesome And Very Very Helpful.....
4142 2018-12-20 03:23:11 More seriously, stocks have historically moved down quite swiftly. (compared to moving up) If that happens, it might still be ok. I imagine the worst would be several years of back to back bear markets - slowly ticking down. That's what will really test the resolve of investors.
4143 2018-12-20 03:22:39 @realDonaldTrump Disappointed in decision to ban bump stocks.  What’s to stop the next guy from banning other accessories now?  Throwing chum in the water for the Dems is not smart.  Should not have banned it.  You are losing voters over this but won’t lose me. Libs have fallen
4144 2018-12-20 03:22:29 @MLPguy Fed or no Fed ... you need to try to keep these pipeline stocks under better control.
4145 2018-12-20 03:22:27 Taking my 401k out of stocks (98% of it was in stocks) on Dec 3rd might be one of the best decisions I've made this year. Damn, the S&P 500 has been tanking since.
4146 2018-12-20 03:22:10 Banning Bump Stocks and Prison Reform would have made it @realDonaldTrump’s best week so far if not for the Syria Pullout.
4147 2018-12-20 03:22:10 Bump stocks are only good for an expensive Sunday afternoon ripping shit up. I would never use a gimmick to protect a life

4149 2018-12-20 03:21:49 Never heard the “home defense argument” in regards to bumpfire stocks....
Not even once.
Straw man is alive and well.

And bump firing is not even close to ”full auto”.
Nobody that has a fraction of a clue about firearms thinks that.

Epic duh
4150 2018-12-20 03:21:48 As a collector, veteran and former police officer I am actually for this ban. I get the notion that many have about “first this then what’s next” but the fact is that bump stocks are capable of increasing the fire rate (if manipulated to do so) to speeds that approach automatic
4151 2018-12-20 03:21:29 Stocks don't go down on Fridays!
4152 2018-12-20 03:20:21 Massive problems with fish quota’s, most of our fish gets exported. Fish stocks very low, being overfished by Chinese trawlers just outside our waters. This is what fisherman say.
4153 2018-12-20 03:20:20 Financial crisis take at least 7 years for recovery , so holding interest rates flat for 7 years was correct. No economist  believed  housing & stock markets  were bubbles. Housing is now in recession w/ falling sales. Most stocks down 20% +. Negative wealth effect = recession
4154 2018-12-20 03:19:14 I'm not following you. I didn't say anything about stocks. I was talking about inflation and the fed funds rate, which are supposed to have a tandem relationship. So if the relationship is out of sync, the next question is, "What's driving the decision to raise interest rates?"

4162 2018-12-20 03:15:38 @realDonaldTrump banning bump stocks was an easy move, no one needs one. You would think since they got that they would be grown ups and help with border security. I mean are they pissed you took that away from them? I guess so.
4163 2018-12-20 03:15:37 No one gave a shit about bump stocks until 2017 because they sucked. So for people to be up in arms about it is sad. Trump gave the libs a small piece. Now winning in 2020 will prevent it from growing

4165 2018-12-20 03:14:46 Who even heard of bump stocks before the Las Vegas massacre? Obama tried to change gun regulations after kindergartners were killed at Sandy Hook, & people freaked out. This is not a whataboutism on Obama!
4166 2018-12-20 03:14:04 @realDonaldTrump you made criminals out of good people today. Bump stocks not needed but your ATF classification said they were OK.  Your going loose alot 2nd amendment hardliners. You know us we speak good of you donate to you. I call pure BS on this one.
4167 2018-12-20 03:13:55 In a stock market correction, investors should keep to the sidelines, avoiding new purchases and perhaps move entirely to cash. But stay engaged.  When a new healthy market uptrend returns, you want to be ready to jump on top stocks breaking out. IBD
4168 2018-12-20 03:13:44 Getting very frustrated! Plus now I’ll be the felon over owning bump stocks. Staring to really smell like shit!
4169 2018-12-20 03:13:39 His administration already banned bump fire stocks and violated the 2nd,4th,5th,and 14th amendments in doing so. Might as well add this to the list.
4170 2018-12-20 03:12:57 The government could also at least buy back the bump stocks .. giving tax credit for them .

4174 2018-12-20 03:12:07 Okay dude, you asked why people hope that the courts strike down the #BumpStockBan and I gave you the answer... it's a question of legality, the DOJ and ATF don't have the legal authority to ban bump stocks, only Congress does. How does that make us psychos?
4175 2018-12-20 03:12:03 If you make an argument focusing on bumpstocks violating the constitution and giving better chance to a free state, and don’t include other items...you don’t care about a free state, you care about bump stocks
4176 2018-12-20 03:11:43 Obama is a gutless putz. That's why he didn't ban bump stocks.
4177 2018-12-20 03:10:38 Truth be told bump stocks are completely worthless but to say they make a semi auto into a automatic weapon is beyond me SMH.

U.S. stocks careened to a 15-month low after Jerome Powell failed to quell investor angst that the Federal Reserve’s tightening policy will throttle economic growth.
Investors had anticipated a less aggressive approach
4180 2018-12-20 03:09:27 @timseymour Thanks for the podcast.  Would love to know your take on some of these Canadian RTO’s and how they have failed miserably in the markets. Tough to give them any credibility when these CSE stocks trade by appointment and prices falling everyday. $ACRG $CURA
4181 2018-12-20 03:08:54 Utang na loob NFA! You can't even keep up on your job to maintain sufficient buffer stocks which contributed to rising inflation! Yun na nga lang hindi niyo pa napagbuti eh. Tapos ngayon gusto niyo i-maintain yung mga powers niyo?? Mukhang maraming mawawalan ng "sideline" ah.
4182 2018-12-20 03:08:53 Did you or anyone else know what bump stocks were when Obama was President? If you did, you should have said something.
4183 2018-12-20 03:08:51 And you somehow think that protects bump stocks from being outlawed? That's a stretch, Dave.
4184 2018-12-20 03:08:21 Yes, bumpstocks, tanks, rocket launchers, nuckear weapons, anti aircraft missles...they would all help achieve that line in the constitution. And if you are someone who thinks banning bump stocks violates the 2nd, hope you feel the same regarding the others
4185 2018-12-20 03:08:15 The market is beginning to realize QT is more a threat than rising rates. QE pumped up stocks for years...unwinding that will have a profound effect.

4187 2018-12-20 03:07:35 At least he banned bump stocks. oh wait, he was supposed to be pro 2A
4188 2018-12-20 03:07:29 Are you suggesting corrections exist to the upside!?!? "But if stocks are going up it can't be bad!!! "
4189 2018-12-20 03:07:06 You can always sell your stocks and move to cash. Cash is a valid option during these troublesome times imo
4190 2018-12-20 03:06:32 Okay, I will dumb this down as much as I can. My friend asks me if I want to invest some money into stocks on this one company. He's invested with me before. He's like "hmm... maybe..." Then I ask him again, and he doesn't reply.
4191 2018-12-20 03:06:01 Buy certain stocks, find your future wife and skip the first one and family first above all
4192 2018-12-20 03:05:58 Explosive run coming for weed stocks @aphriainc up next. Aurora Cannabis may be too deluded and complicated they have like 15+ subsidiaries at piont
4193 2018-12-20 03:05:51 Because nobody really has bump stocks, and from what I’ve read they can be made pretty easily, so it’s like banning toast that has been nibbled into a gun shape.
4194 2018-12-20 03:05:51 So the Trump administration is banning bump stocks and no where anywhere is there any NRA backlash or 2nd Amendment retardicans whining... is there a bigger group of hypocrites anywhere?
4195 2018-12-20 03:05:44 Left his wife in 1982. Hardly an affair. Even still, mayors don’t have pull enough to get you to the Senate. She paid her dues! Women discounting women. What a shame. Suppose you approve of bump stocks too.

4201 2018-12-20 03:03:46 The equivalency of this is that its in the vein of two NRA members arguing something like whether bump stocks or full automatic increase the kill rates in mass shootings. Uhhh two wrongs are still two wrongs children.
4202 2018-12-20 03:03:45 Market volatility may not be great for investors but its a boon to some stocks. The longer the volatility the better these get benefited  $IBKR $ETFC $AMTD

4204 2018-12-20 03:03:21 Looks like we missed the time to sell stocks but it’s almost time to buy buy buy!!
4205 2018-12-20 03:03:19 Si doc talaga may kasalanan kung bakit hindi ako umabot sa PLM eh! Natuwa mag adjust! Tas habang nag aadjust siya nagkkwento siya about Stocks/ Capital budgeting etc 
4206 2018-12-20 03:02:52 So accessories are included in the constitution? And again, I assume you think tanks and the others being banned broke the constitution similar to your feelings for bump stocks?
4207 2018-12-20 03:02:45 Happy birthday sir - Hopefully we will enjoy the rally at the same pace as we are enjoying from last 8 trading session in Mid-Small cap stocks UpTo your next birthday 
4208 2018-12-20 03:02:41 Not if you’re limited to only buying stocks in retirement account...can’t buy options.

Trump Administration Poised to Lift Rusal Sanctions 
Russian Billionaire Oleg Deripaska to reduce his ownership stake in Rusal below 50%
LME proposes to lift suspension on aluminium if US sanction were lifted
Source: Bloomberg
4210 2018-12-20 03:02:21 That’s what I’m debating. Should I pull out of stocks and put everything in bonds? I’m 40 and still have 20+ years before retirement
4211 2018-12-20 03:01:25 I don’t have a list...I’m simply saying if you are arguing that bump stocks increase probability for free state, and not other items, you are picking and choosing what you want.
4212 2018-12-20 03:00:53 Im just planning to stay in bed till tmr but ada customer  so i have to buy for the stocks
4213 2018-12-20 03:00:49 I’m of two minds. Bump stocks are merely a work around to possess a functioning auto weapon. ATF has previously looked the other way, but I have nobproblems with the reclassification. I do have real problems with FirstStep legislation that will release thousands of felons early.
4214 2018-12-20 03:00:30 81% of the S&P 500 stocks are in correction. Of those ,54% are in a bear market. Of the 2,800 stocks on the NYSE, 880 of them made new 52-week lows on Monday. That is a record.

4216 2018-12-20 02:58:40 No big deal on the bump stocks, I agree on the BGCs. I will support.
4217 2018-12-20 02:58:00 STFU bump stocks are not covered in 2nd amendment,  bare arms is the 2nd amendment and there were zero automatic weapons then, so take that bs and shove it. He must give in some areas or you are just ignorant of the way things work. Fuck your own agenda and help save our country!
4218 2018-12-20 02:57:55 No

Six trading days left in 2018

4223 2018-12-20 02:56:11 Rich people invest, removing those funds from circulation. Middle class people spend, making stocks go up. If middle class people can’t afford to buy things, and rich people take their money out of circulation by investing, stocks will go down and everyone loses.
4224 2018-12-20 02:55:19 In financial ruin because I invested all of my money in Welcome To Marwen stocks!!
4225 2018-12-20 02:55:15 Yup. And bump stocks are just a product at a store . I guess the significance of this Americanism faux pas escapes you.
4226 2018-12-20 02:54:34 Stocks in general will produce larger returns than Bonds.

#AwaazMarkets @CNBC_Awaaz
4230 2018-12-20 02:53:51 10 BILLION TO SOUTH AMERICA?  BUMP STOCKS... MAKING LAWS BASED ON FALSE FLAGS... 60 Percent of Americans who Pay Attention know.. MULTIPLE WITNESSES SAW MULTIPLE SHOOTERS... WTH IS GOING ON?  You LOST ALOT TODAY!!!
4231 2018-12-20 02:53:34 Honestly most of the pot stocks are financial engineered scams that wil vaporizer over time.Pot is a pure low entry barrier and commodity with no pricing over time . This is the dot com bubble 2.0
4232 2018-12-20 02:51:35 I always love the comparisons to Steve Jobs. Thing is he built a company whose revenue and earnings  actually supported the stock price. Don't forget it has been a perfect storm of ultra easy money and flying stocks for the past 10 years. One Q of profits, not sustainable
4233 2018-12-20 02:51:20 ¿You mean we could have gotten up at noon and traded cNnibis stocks?
4234 2018-12-20 02:51:09 Someone talked to me about  investing in stocks for the first time yesterday, and I’ve been reading up on it ever since.
4235 2018-12-20 02:51:05 I sold my bump stocks when I saw the price falling. Got out just in time.
4236 2018-12-20 02:51:03  Where were you when the bump stocks stopped bumping
 On that December day...
4237 2018-12-20 02:50:04 i know of one for renders and alts not for stocks, lemme find it
4238 2018-12-20 02:49:52 And do you support the method and precedent that Trump set by how he banned bump stocks?
4239 2018-12-20 02:49:50 I’m lowering my ‘Trump wins in 2020’ percentage to 80% (from 85 earlier) what with Coulter, Levin, NYPost, Freedom Caucus, gun rights groups, and too many to keep track of today/tonight, a bit pissed at the Wall, Syria, Russia sanctions and bump-stocks.
4240 2018-12-20 02:49:34 Wrong again!  Props given on prison reform and bump stocks.  Now where is your credibility when it comes to Trump?  It doesn’t exist - The bumbling clown can do no wrong in your eyes. 
4241 2018-12-20 02:49:25 Top stocks to watch out for on December 20: TCS, Maruti Suzuki, Jet Airways, RCom
4242 2018-12-20 02:49:24 My whole point was why are you trying to argue that bump stocks would increase chances of success and not tanks, etc? If you think bump stocks are the secret to securing a free state, your free state will be free for all of about 4 minutes 
4243 2018-12-20 02:49:19 Funny how many crickets are in the NRA camp now that the Trump administration wants to ban bump stocks.

But remember, it's the libruls that are gon' take are gunz!
4244 2018-12-20 02:48:53 Maybe markets should be asking Who’s gonna buy all the stocks?
4245 2018-12-20 02:48:39 Obama had to fight the whole Republican controlled Congress. The ATF decided in 2010 that since bump stocks were not actually a weapon, they couldn't be regulated. That was upheld in 2012 too. They weren't 'approved' & it should be noted that Trump rolled back Obama's gun EOs.
4246 2018-12-20 02:48:25 Love that graph with the stocks and negative returns.
4247 2018-12-20 02:48:24 They’re just @FoxNews laughing stocks! Peeps laughing at them, not with them 
4248 2018-12-20 02:48:22 Most Americans had never heard of bump stocks until Las Vegas! You’re way overthinking this one!
4249 2018-12-20 02:48:16 FINALLY someone willing to share names!!!  Drive =s me crazy when pols and others complain about certain individuals not helping with issues and we never hear the names!!  Accountability means knowing NAMES!!!  Personally I still believe in the stocks!!!
4250 2018-12-20 02:48:03 No one cares about bump stocks. They’re a gimmick and not widely used. As a 2A supporter, I could care less about this ban. This is about as effective and purposeful as putting a ban on plastic sofa covers. Sure, some people use them, but why are we wasting time/money for the 3%?
4251 2018-12-20 02:48:03 Smh...because they would. Any person with any sense knows those things would increase the chance of success. I never said I believed it was needed, but simply that it would increase their chances, which you were arguing grump stocks would do
4252 2018-12-20 02:47:59 Im a gun owner, not a trump voter,  & have used a bump stock before. It's not like other accessories. Most accessories improve safety in some way. Bump stocks make it harder to control & more dangerous, like any other non gun item removed from the market for safety.
4253 2018-12-20 02:47:55 Congratulations on the Birthday kid what stocks are ya gonna take
4254 2018-12-20 02:47:23 he is not taking guns away ,he wants the bump stocks to go away..huge diff..i dont agree with him but he is not taking out guns
4255 2018-12-20 02:47:03 The wall, no border security, awful Syria decision, bump stocks restricted, releasing criminals from jail early and often, Wilbur ross monetary problems, interest rate rise, stocks crashing, general Flynn's terrible lawyers, not a lot of good this week...;(
4256 2018-12-20 02:46:59 I suppose bonds are less volatile than stocks, & wealthier investors tend to prefer them, but they're not necessarily safe.

Interest rates up, bonds down. Dollar down, interest rates up.
4257 2018-12-20 02:46:49 I sincerely hope the government plans a massive intensive trustworthy exercise to help the know-nothing investors maximise their earning capabilities by investing wisely and safely in the future of this country and earning dividends (infra, energy, IT stocks and ETFs)
4258 2018-12-20 02:46:41 Did @kanyewest get Trump to ban bump stocks?
4259 2018-12-20 02:46:22 @realDonaldTrump why go behind your back and support the ban of bump stocks? I’ve supported you from the beginning of your campaign and you’ve just lost me. I’ll support you and republicans but you went behind your back. Now I’m second guessing if you deserve to be re-elected
4260 2018-12-20 02:46:10 @tedlieu @NancyPelosi @HouseDemocrats @SenWarren @SenateDems @SenSherrodBrown When will #WilburRoss be brought up on charges for lies about divesting his stocks since he is the #CommerceSecretary #MajorConflictofInterest @nytimes @washingtonpost @BostonGlobe @baltimoresun
4261 2018-12-20 02:46:00 Only an inner group of gun wack jobs knew what bump stocks were before Vegas. There will only be fake backlash from the automatic weapons group. Over in 5 minutes. Don’t need bump stock when I can buy a large capacity automatic weapon everywhere
4262 2018-12-20 02:45:58 So you want bump stocks bc it gives the militia a better chance to ensure a free state, but you don’t want the other things? So you aren’t really worried about ensuring a free state, just getting your bump stocks lol
4263 2018-12-20 02:45:46 You forgot what I told you Buddy. 
Never fall in love with stocks.
4264 2018-12-20 02:45:36 I've heard most people are too poor to own stocks or invest in 401k and only the rich are effected by this. I can vouch for myself that this is true.
4265 2018-12-20 02:45:17 Not sure if I like this move and the banning of bump stocks... y is he of all people bending to the Dems... ???
4266 2018-12-20 02:44:21 Lmao my dad is obsessed with #Cheetos Puffs and my mom stocks it everywhere. In her car, inside the house and in the garage.  Can’t stop committed love.
4267 2018-12-20 02:43:28 you think that gold is overvalued? capital is constantly rotating, looking for the next big thing. Crypto universe got a taste of that a year ago. And, how can bonds and stocks crash at the same time? Crypto will rise when it starts being usable.
4268 2018-12-20 02:43:12 Not many were aware of bump stocks b/f the Las Vegas massacre.
4269 2018-12-20 02:43:04 Stop! You know that the bump stock accessory enables a semiautomatic rifle like an AR-15 to function like a fully automatic weapon. Those who support bump stocks do not do the 2A and supporters of the NRA any good. @realDonaldTrump
4270 2018-12-20 02:43:02 you banned bump stocks and had to dissolve your “charity” because it came out that you weren’t being charitable and now you’re using troops as a political prop
4271 2018-12-20 02:42:33 He banned Bump Stocks too!
4272 2018-12-20 02:41:19 College HCs sliding their “thank you” watching Crane’s Ken Salee... @K3_Elite1  ,  his stocks will continue to rise.   Best Shooter of class 2020.     Work ethic,  practice repetition translates to game.     This kid has been in the shadow of pro training since 7th grade!
4273 2018-12-20 02:41:12 Should ban bump stocks and the guns they go on. And charge a ton for bullets and clips. That would help.
4274 2018-12-20 02:41:00 No...I said if you state that bump stocks are needed to be “necessary to free state” which YOU said,  but you don’t think those other items are needed, then you are a hypocrite just whining about bump stocks
4275 2018-12-20 02:40:35 How would a ban on bump stocks have prevented that, seeing as you can bump fire without a bump stock?
4276 2018-12-20 02:40:22 Btw I own a gun & believe in gun ownership by responsible adults. I do not think guns belong at schools. Also dont believe we should have assault weapons or bump stocks
4277 2018-12-20 02:40:07 1  trump just announced that he did it (doesn't make it legal)
2 most people never heard of bumb stocks until Vegas ( Obama was no longer president)
3 trump & the GOP promised they would ban bump stocks RIGHT AFTER Vegas  & didn't 
4 ANOTHER trump diversion for ANOTHER bad week
4278 2018-12-20 02:39:38 Don’t get me wrong, I still put in the work because investing in stocks is more addictive than a cigarette covered in cocaine, but I don’t want to jump in too soon
4279 2018-12-20 02:38:34 The Celtics have TWENTY-EIGHT stocks tonight and are losing. The Suns have 14.
4280 2018-12-20 02:38:23 why you doin 2 stocks lol
4281 2018-12-20 02:38:15 No, I don’t...I’m just pointing out that you are idiotic and a hypocrite for your whole argument since you want “the best chances for a free state”...but apparently to you, that’s just bump stocks lol
4282 2018-12-20 02:38:12 The blueprints for the bump stocks are already out on the Internet for your CNC machines and 3-D printers.
4283 2018-12-20 02:37:42 Actually curious which stocks those 25 were, on a massive red day like today.
4284 2018-12-20 02:37:15 When your stocks pay out dividends but it’s only $1 
4285 2018-12-20 02:36:49 @CNBC how does this network that has been following stocks for so many years not be able to better project what is going on with the market fluctuations.  you should have the knowledge to let viewers know buys made since October are bad!  really what is the value add.
4286 2018-12-20 02:36:43 you know you can sell your stocks...even in your retirement accounts...talk to your financial advisor
4287 2018-12-20 02:36:34 I had a krool 3 stocks 3 minutes run away the entire time till sudden death and win with projectiles :/
4288 2018-12-20 02:36:32 Exactly, and it’s only your stance that bump stocks are needed. If you are whining about bump stocks, but do not think that tanks, nuclear weapons, and etc would increase the chances of a free state that you have referenced so many times, then you are simply a hypocrite
4289 2018-12-20 02:36:27 I think it’s because nobody really cares about bump stocks. It’s like if they banned the bottle opener rail attachment.
4290 2018-12-20 02:36:19 I got a Jigglypuff ditto and rested that h*e all 3 stocks

4293 2018-12-20 02:35:55 So now Democrat’s are not going to try and ban the AR-15 after all these years bc Trump magically banned bump stocks? Wake the hell up!

4298 2018-12-20 02:35:24 Its not Research! Its about killing whales to protect fish stocks for Japan!!!
4299 2018-12-20 02:35:12 What I’ve learned...stocks take the stairs up & a window down. Bulls versus Bears is the most gangster position one can find themselves in.
4300 2018-12-20 02:35:00 Bump stocks weren’t an emotional thing during Obama’s government. This gives Trump an obviously evil bugbear to knock down so he can continue to support the FSB-backed @NRA In its (and the Russians’) goal to decimate American citizens through fear and uncontrolled gun fetishism.
4301 2018-12-20 02:34:44 I have been waiting for Trump to tank the market so I can buy up mutual funds and stocks.  Now is a good time but I think there's more value coming.....

Gonna be plenty money to be made.
4302 2018-12-20 02:34:34 Trump illegally criminalized bump stocks as machine guns while signing onto a bill that allows early release for people who traffic machine guns.
4303 2018-12-20 02:34:04 DJI - death cross today - not good. Some ppl don't believe in them, thing is, all three of our majors now have the cross down. I trade oil stocks and 99.9% of the time when they get the cross down, they go much lower - we shall see. Good trading...
4304 2018-12-20 02:34:02 Yep- had same thing with a family member puke their stocks at the internal low in Fall ‘08 because of him- didn’t find out until well after the fact
4305 2018-12-20 02:33:43 Like most of the b group stocks it has plummeted but I'll humbly accept I was wrong
4306 2018-12-20 02:33:12 As of 10:30 a.m., PSEi 7,514.62 down 65.00 points or 0.86 percent. #PSEiupdate #PSEi #stocks
4307 2018-12-20 02:32:57 Again, read previous tweet...if that’s your stance, your still being idiotic, because bump stocks aren’t going to help you one bit against nuclear weapons, tanks, military aircraft, etc...so whine for those to be available to public
4308 2018-12-20 02:32:36 It’s not about bump stocks stupid. It’s the fact that your president redefined what a machine gun is without congress. What happens when an anti gun democrat gets into office? Hmmm...don’t need congress to make new guns laws. Bye bye AR-15’s
4309 2018-12-20 02:32:36 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
4310 2018-12-20 02:32:28 ... and no bump stocks, too! 
4311 2018-12-20 02:31:46 It's ironic that the first gun regulation in decades has come under a GOP controlled government.  Now, anyone who knows guns understands that bump stocks are meaningless to nearly every gun enthusiast.  But the slippery slope argument will come into play.
4312 2018-12-20 02:30:28 Saw a bunch of stuff online and in TD Ameritrade about bump stocks, have been wondering what the hell those were (Google's 5 seconds away), like some sort of weird companies that sold road bumps. Just realized that I've actually seen a video about bump stocks before.
4313 2018-12-20 02:29:56 More people than you know support the U.S. Constitution. Lumping everyone who holds concern over a blind Second Amendment does not disqualify us from the discussion. Getting rid of bump stocks was a start. Closing Gun Show loopholes is another. #Patriot
4314 2018-12-20 02:29:26 Bump stocks banned, significant criminal justice reform passed, exit of troops from Syria...all good news!
4315 2018-12-20 02:29:20 To be clear, we like all your points about #China. We also think it’s going to be a tough ride for #Stocks. Thanks for taking the time!
4316 2018-12-20 02:29:11 It will indirectly boost the global liquidity to a greater extent as people from other countries will be able to buy fractions of US stocks with trust and without going through brokers.
4317 2018-12-20 02:29:04 But now give OUR President Donald Trump credit  where credit is do for  signing it into LAW to BAN Bump Stocks so regular Citizens canNOT obtain them.
4318 2018-12-20 02:28:35 So many Christians adoring their bump stocks and AR 15s more than their Crucifixes. An abomination.
4319 2018-12-20 02:28:24 Let me smash both of u to 0 stocks
4320 2018-12-20 02:28:17 So if the government bans bump stocks, I guess they have to ban rubber bands too??
4321 2018-12-20 02:28:14 The stock market fell -1.5%, tech stocks -2%, on news that Donald’s disaster of fake economic policies is likely to continue through January 3rd. Relief may be in sight if we can hold out that long.
4322 2018-12-20 02:28:11 Equities are the greatest wealth creators......if one gets the stocks selection right.

Such is the power of equities........they are a must for wealth creation!
4323 2018-12-20 02:28:11 December must be a worst month fucken stocks are getting low smh
4324 2018-12-20 02:28:00 “Individual 1” has managed to cause all major stocks to spiral down except one...Barack Obama’s stock is skyrocketing.
4325 2018-12-20 02:27:11 This is the type of insight and values that I like to see from people... Bump stocks are not the end of the world and the prison break reform is important but not priority like Border Security/National Security and saving our Constitution.
Really great job Steph! 

4326 2018-12-20 02:26:57 Which stocks are in your radar for todays session? UPL and Auropharma for us

Both are IB. Auro looks weak and UPL may bounce as per ichimoku. Will wait for market to open and then decide the trade.

#independenttrader
4327 2018-12-20 02:26:10 I am not a great proponent of bump stocks, but when one type of gun ban is approved it becomes easier for the next.
4328 2018-12-20 02:26:07 Added to the buy low and hold is that there are moments where market cycles do not favor ANY diverse mix of growth stocks which we saw in 2008. In prep for these times we assess if the risks are favorable more to growth or defensive bonds or commodities or cash, then allocate
4329 2018-12-20 02:26:03 Was Obama ever presented the opportunity? I’m not sure “bump stocks” were universally known before 2017.

4331 2018-12-20 02:25:55 Tyou Kirsten, gun control in the guise of moderation, this affects a "Lot" more than bump stocks.

Select fire automatic expanded to a "rate of fire" restriction.

Almost all semi autos can be bump fired without a bump stock.

Pandora's box is now open

GOA will stand & fight
4332 2018-12-20 02:25:53 Well who cares about the rocket launcher its those extremely dangerous bump stocks im worried about ( i hear they take over your guns body & wreak havoc) they even make the bullets their bitch.we need the rocket launcher to protect us from them
4333 2018-12-20 02:25:50 Obama never ended a war. Never legalized hemp, did prison reform or banned bump stocks. Just saying.
4334 2018-12-20 02:25:07 The premise of this bump stock ban is ridiculous. Do I care at all about bump stocks? No. Do I care that the AG and POTUS can make thousands of people criminals and outlaw their property without due process? Absolutely.
4335 2018-12-20 02:24:58 Secure the southern border now, and at any expense. Americans don’t care about prison reform, they don’t care about bumb stocks, don’t care about the deficits.... They want the southern border to be secured. Bush had a promise, no new taxes. Trump’ a beautiful border wall
4336 2018-12-20 02:24:43 This is an old right wing NRA attack on Obama since 2017. Obama's ATF did not have authority to ban Bumps Stock. Only way to ban is by legislation. GOP controlled legislature never got bump stocks ban law written. GOP created gridlock then blamed Obama for not doing enough.

4338 2018-12-20 02:24:18 $MU  earning was a great outlook on how the economy is slowing down. It's a value trap and has more pain ahead. Chip stocks are cyclical and follow the economic cycle.  $AMD $AMAT $LRCX $NVDA earnings  will bring each other down. I'd like to hear anyone change my mind.
4339 2018-12-20 02:23:49 He just lost the 2020 election via his actions this week of ditching the wall and banning bump stocks. It is frightening to think of who the left will nominate.
4340 2018-12-20 02:23:47 how many people were murdered by bump stocks (rifles) in the last ten years and how many people were murdered by small caliber handguns?
4341 2018-12-20 02:23:17 Thus, only people who can afford to buy those expensive stocks are willing to pay. The poor will never be able to afford buying. Tokenising stock and other financial products allows the world to trade will give access to the poor to buy stock in fraction. 2/2
4342 2018-12-20 02:22:55 Now that we know everything Trump does is crooked let's look at the stock market. He creates tariffs and economic chaos to drive down the market. Next he buys huge quantities of low-priced stocks. Then he removes at tariffs. Nice scheme!!!

4348 2018-12-20 02:21:27 Bump stocks were originally developed the assist those with upper body limitations. The @ATFHQ #BumpStockBan 
therefore violates the ADA.
4349 2018-12-20 02:21:21 Trump's hair brained economic policies are starting to kick-in and stocks are tanking. If he goes into 2020 with a terrible economy and no wall, I don't like his chances!

4351 2018-12-20 02:20:53 Because bump stocks are simply an accessory that most gun owners don’t use or can live without. 

This isn’t the give an inch and they take a mile like magazine capacity or “assault rifle” nonsense gun owners usually face. It’s a minor issue that isn’t worth the fight.

We're only a few percentage points away from there.

4363 2018-12-20 02:18:56 I notice David: that you did NOT say anything about OUR President Donald  Trump signing a law to "BAN Bump Stocks" to make it illegal for regular citizens  to obtain? As you know, this ruling happened yesterday. [I just found it strange  that you are silent on this ].
4364 2018-12-20 02:18:48 Bump stocks...seriously ?!

When & how did this bullshit become a real issue ?
4365 2018-12-20 02:18:41 5.  No logical reason why a person practiced with bump fire technique would hit something other than what he or she aimed at any more than someone practiced with semi-auto fire would.
6.  The same arguments that attempt to prove bump stocks dangerous are used for *every firearm*.

4368 2018-12-20 02:17:51 Why are good Americans now Felons for owning "bump stocks"?
4369 2018-12-20 02:17:47 Isn't that opposite? I thought bump stocks held the trigger down (or something)
4370 2018-12-20 02:17:36 So Donald Trump has banned Bump Stocks. Great. He took action on Gun control, something Obama couldn’t do in 8 years. The bump stocks are attachments for the AR and AK families semi-autos.

4376 2018-12-20 02:16:32 Banning bump stocks is an infringement on 2a
4377 2018-12-20 02:16:25 The constitutionality question isn’t really about the ban, it’s about who’s doing it. I agree that it’s wholly reasonable to ban bump stocks, as they effectively create an automatic weapon. But a president putting the ban in place w/o Congress is a scary precedent to set.
4378 2018-12-20 02:16:21 Everyone seems to be saying that. We are a bit skeptical of popular narratives. 

CAPE is already below 30. With 10 year terminal target at 3% that actually makes #Stocks reasonably attractive.

#Recession timing might be possible, but we are not there yet.

4383 2018-12-20 02:15:07 1.  Bump stocks are idiotic toys.
2.  They do NOT make a firearm a fully automatic weapon, by ATF definition of long standing.
3.  Banning them is a political move to pander to certain interests.
4.  This ban is provably not in the interest of public safety.
4384 2018-12-20 02:14:51 I'll just say that using bump stocks has nothing to do with the safe and legal use of firearms...  As for being a "fake member", you are a fool, and a jack ass! (Nothing I have is over 12 rounds btw)

4388 2018-12-20 02:13:45 Like so many GOPer, the NRA is on both sides of the issue.  They support a ban on future sales - meaning that gun companies (& the NRA) do not profit from the sales - & oppose outlawing existing 520,000 bump stocks in private hands,so as to not piss off their constituents.

4412 2018-12-20 02:05:26 All good points.

Timeframe is key. We buy stocks that we think will perform over long time horizon, say 5-10 years. This reduces taxes and transaction costs.

As for cash, we don’t have a reliable means of timing the stock market. Therefore, we don’t pretend me can time bottoms.

4423 2018-12-20 02:03:34 Actually I don't think people would have cared had Obama done it..they are largely indifferent to "bump stocks". It is not seen as a second amendment issue. It's like banning leather carry straps. It's an accessory. So, respectfully, I disagree with your analysis. Regards.

4432 2018-12-20 02:00:31 Obama was trying to pass real gun reform. Not these stop gap measures that aren’t going to make any real difference. Bump stocks weren’t on the radar until Vegas
4433 2018-12-20 02:00:30 Pure speculation and doubtful that plummeting stocks would matter because doing biz with subscribestar does not diminish their value so some idiots will make bad investments and sell in protest and someone else will buy it low.  As long as the crap is legal no one should care.

4435 2018-12-20 02:00:02 From what I know, Obama DOJ didn’t think they had the legal ability to ban bump stocks, plus fear of gun lobby backlash
4436 2018-12-20 01:59:56 Bump stocks aren't good for your guns. They get too hot from the rapid refiring. The gun owners in my circle won't use them for that reason. On principle alone (2A), the ban is concerning. .
4437 2018-12-20 01:59:43 Bump stocks achieved national notoriety (Vegas, Parkland) after Obama was gone.

4442 2018-12-20 01:57:18 Because they used it to buy back their own stocks instead of increasing wages or creating new jobs to boost the economy. They're concerned about themselves only. Pure greed.
4443 2018-12-20 01:57:10 True. But it's still ridiculous to ban it. It's a "range toy" that decreases accuracy. From what I've heard, it's also easy to make something with a similar effect out of a few nails & some plywood. Banning bump stocks will have zero impact on anyone's safety.

4446 2018-12-20 01:56:00 Why is the NRA not filing a lawsuit about the bump stocks?
4447 2018-12-20 01:55:57 One Obama observation. Before you all yell at me. I voted TWICE for him. Just listen to me for a minute. How is it possible trump bans bump stocks by executive order today but Obama didn’t? Honest question. Got me thinking.. What am I missing here?
4448 2018-12-20 01:55:50 bump stocks are only for killing mass amounts of people
4449 2018-12-20 01:55:35 Asian stocks dropped after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell failed  to quell investor concerns that tightening policy will choke economic  growth. Treasuries pared back some of Wednesday’s gains and U.S. stock  futures ticked higher.
4450 2018-12-20 01:55:20 It's people trying to get back in before the end of the year. There will be another dip after the 1st, and then (I'm hoping) a nice bull run in 2019, especially if stocks go south (which I expect they will).
4451 2018-12-20 01:55:15 Trump bans 'bump stocks' used in Las Vegas mass shooting @Ioana_Banal
4452 2018-12-20 01:54:59 So all those that already have bump stocks either destroy them or go to jail?
4453 2018-12-20 01:54:42 If the #fed is correct about growth next year, then stocks are grossly oversold. The big question is the “if”.
4454 2018-12-20 01:54:09 Like disturbing an Ant hill, the Admin bans Bump Stocks and the rhetoric ramps up?
4455 2018-12-20 01:53:56 Better start investing in stocks with all this money you spending
4456 2018-12-20 01:53:33 Are the 20,000+ other laws working? Bump stocks, please people won’t destroy or turn in. They’ll be just like unregistered guns, no way to know who actually has one but hey you got a law passed! I’d rather have a paying job than a hobby but I’m an adult.

4458 2018-12-20 01:52:44 In other news the pentagon can’t account for 21 Trillion dollars and the pentagon now has a budget that republicans and democrats increased more then Donald Trump requested. But please let’s go back to talking about bump-stocks.
4459 2018-12-20 01:51:53 Stocks soared earlier; Trump said he was the cause. In December the market tanked. Still waiting for the White House to take credit for that.
4460 2018-12-20 01:51:24 Bump stocks were legal and made it so guns had no recoil and therefore making it easier to keep shooting your weapon
4461 2018-12-20 01:50:27 Bayonetta is gonna be like meta knight in smash4. Everyone thinks they're bottom tier until a 13 year old Mexican kid 2 stocks Mr.R and the character gets buffed into high tier
4462 2018-12-20 01:49:55 Clearly I’m bearish, and short the market as a whole along with other indv stocks and ETFs. However I understand apprehension to short a market, and respect anyone willing to take money to the sideline, into cash, to have dry powder waiting at the bottom.
4463 2018-12-20 01:49:11 Exactly. Trumps feel emboldened to obey Putin dictate after their self congratulatory criminal justice bill and bump stocks ban. They never do anything gratis. Putin is in complete control of Trumps.
4464 2018-12-20 01:48:30 Not at all.  Jus EXHAUSTED from tryin 2 open idiots eyes 2 what's happening right before them. Bet U cheered the repeal of health ins, 2, didn't ya? MAGA! WOOHOO! Lost $3000 in stocks since summer. SOO much winning! He had no involvement w/any of these crooks, right? 
4465 2018-12-20 01:48:28 Correction.  Already is fucking it up.

The drop of the stock market on Wednesday puts the S&P 500 down 14.5 percent from its recent peak — a drop of 20 percent would put stocks in a new bear market.
4466 2018-12-20 01:48:17 Of course they don’t care about the American people.  They only care about their hatred of Trump.  Remember Bill Maher wanted the stocks to crash and to have a recession to get rid of Trump.  The left are vile rats.
4467 2018-12-20 01:47:46 Speaking of sleazebags, you backed the ban on gimmicky bump stocks? You obviously have no experience with firearms or what makes them effective or ineffective. You've proven yourself to be a populist, rather than a President who stands for American values. You disgust me, S.O.B.!
4468 2018-12-20 01:46:25 Will you address the fact that the federal government, by executive fiat, has declared its intentions to confiscate 100s of thousands of bump stocks from legal gun owners? This is an absolute overreach by tyrants and should be legally challenged.
4469 2018-12-20 01:46:20 Trump is following Putin orders to hand over Syria. He also lifted sanctions on Russian oligarch's steel company. After the criminal justice bill & bump stocks ban he feels he can do whatever Putin tells him. Yes, we need to get out of Syria, but this plays into Putin's hands
4470 2018-12-20 01:46:18 Wow Sean, kray-kray-CRAZY talk from you. They'd ONLY be felons if they refuse to destroy the stocks, which would be a violation of the law and definitely something "wrong." And the NRA could be suing over this, but they're not. They've accepted it. You're to the right of the NRA!
4471 2018-12-20 01:46:16 Yet it was Obama who approved bump stocks
4472 2018-12-20 01:46:05 If your not buying in CBD or hemp based stocks now you’re going to miss the moment
4473 2018-12-20 01:45:47 Maybe they are spending those tax cuts. My stocks are in the toilet. What's with that?
4474 2018-12-20 01:45:05 WOW last week Financial Pundits stated DOW, NASDAC,S&P500 companies with rTrump tax break bought back 1 TRILLION DOLLARS in stocks. ZERO for the middle class. rTump voters CONED AGAIN, stupid is as stupid does LOL
4475 2018-12-20 01:44:58 Love when I hear "the fed could lose its credibility.". What serious person thinks they are credible?

#TheFed #stocks #rates
4476 2018-12-20 01:44:49 Do you even know what a bump stock is or what it does? I highly doubt you do. Because if you did, you’d realize how stupid a ban of bump stocks is
4477 2018-12-20 01:43:47 Hotkeys would be nice
4478 2018-12-20 01:43:38 apple stocks rise by 20%.
4479 2018-12-20 01:43:29 @realDonaldTrump Banning Bump stocks- unconstitutional! Firearms act of 1934 - unconstitutional! Now the judge in Florida say Cops had no duty to protect the people! Yet we still have gun free zones! So Tell me, who exactly is going to protect our children in school! WHO!!!
4480 2018-12-20 01:42:52 So the Fed has raised interest rates in Dec just like they said...stocks go down
Banks are happy
4481 2018-12-20 01:41:59 While everyone is freaking out about stocks I’m still just thrilled to be out of debt 
4482 2018-12-20 01:41:58 Because I’m a teacher(a long term sub) I wouldn’t mind a solution to ban bump stocks! However, I would fight to make sure we armed our schools, as President Trump is doing! Hillary would’ve banned handguns as well! As far as Prison reform, I don’t see that as bad as illegals!
4483 2018-12-20 01:41:54 No no no. Not too easy on traditional markets. Fed will be opening their own balance sheet. Wondering, how fast would stocks and bonds fall from a cliff if fed would close their own trading desk and would be unable to buy stocks and bonds with filthy fiat printed by them...
4484 2018-12-20 01:41:44 @realDonaldTrump Great job with our economy! We’ve only lost 5.6% in stocks this year! We are winning bigly!! You’re such a hack...
4485 2018-12-20 01:41:38 Warren Buffett: Buy a business, don't rent stocks.
4486 2018-12-20 01:41:14 If u follow me you would know I sold a lot at 36c. PLS I sold my whole position & might re enter at the right time, if, + hold also 20m WFE. No other spec stocks for the moment.

As I also said I am cashed up (as have sold all my blue chips portfolios) 

So am not sad 
4487 2018-12-20 01:40:46 No it’s not. Bump stocks have literally no impact on gun crime. It doesn’t actually change the rate of fire for a weapon.
4488 2018-12-20 01:40:35 But, but, but, bump stocks?
4489 2018-12-20 01:40:32 But that’s just it...who defines that it’s ridiculous? You? Because some people think bump stocks are ridiculous...the purpose of the 2nd is to keep the government from taking your guns away...which guns were taken?
4490 2018-12-20 01:39:35 How are you feeling about the ban on Bump Stocks?
THE TRUTH DENIED — crazy
4491 2018-12-20 01:39:34 So if I get this right, the @NRA only has a problem with bump stock ban because the plan includes confiscation of already purchased bump stocks? Not because it takes the right of future purchases to law abiding citizens? Freedoms safest place...sometimes.

Have fun gambling with garbage penny stocks. BTC is in the perfect position to become a societal cornerstone.
4494 2018-12-20 01:39:04 Agreed, Fed has to sacrifice two of its “children” (dollar, USTs, stocks), and yet will get graded really only on outcome for stocks, for near/medium term anyway ... Powell will wake up to this reality within 2-3 months I predict
4495 2018-12-20 01:39:03 and buy back their own stocks creating a vortex of greed

4497 2018-12-20 01:38:13 RT TheBullBull "Nifty should hit 11k.

Don't get caught in any euphoria.

IMO it should react by about 100 to 150 points after hitting mount 11k.

4498 2018-12-20 01:38:12 They don’t need bump stocks. They have fully automatic assault rifles.
4499 2018-12-20 01:38:02 So is everyone who has stocks
4500 2018-12-20 01:37:58 WOULD YOU LIKE TO COMMENT ON YOUR AND THE NRA’S COWARDESS ON PROTECTING OUR RIGHTS ON BUMP STOCKS?
4501 2018-12-20 01:37:31 Trump just banned bump stocks and you are still badmouthing him like the punk you are.
4502 2018-12-20 01:37:27 The very best stocks are usually the last to drop. They try to hold onto them as long as they can. 
Usually a sign of capitulation when they finally drop & then bounce hard, then gain upward momentum again.

No idea what mkt does next though. Very oversold mkt, but no buyers yet
4503 2018-12-20 01:37:13 dood the right got me so fucked up on bump stocks that the left seems more inviting right now
4504 2018-12-20 01:37:07 Does policy mistake just mean policy that keeps stocks from going up? 

Sure seems like it
4505 2018-12-20 01:36:40 It’s within their authority. Banning bump stocks is not a violation of the 2nd Amdt or any other constitutional or legal rights on gun ownership. They have 1 function and that is to shoot the most amount of people on the least amount of time & unleash carnage!!

4507 2018-12-20 01:35:27 Bump stocks have horrible accuracy . They are more of a conversation piece.
4508 2018-12-20 01:35:07 didn't even turn on the screen today-Felt strongly that markets would not rally-in spite of what the EXPERTS SAID-INTERESTING TO SEE HOW FAR DOWN THE MARKETS GO TOMORROW-STOCKS TRADING A REDICULOUS VALUES
4509 2018-12-20 01:34:55 Obama-like?? You mean - a TRUMP-LIKE mistake. How are your stocks doing Miss Lindsey?? Lost a few (hundred) points, haven’t they? “But but but OBAMA!”.. Yeah. The guy who nearly tripled the stock market. You weren’t complaining then, were you 
4510 2018-12-20 01:34:40 bump stock ban is good, that' something Obama did. Never agreed with that. And I'm pro 2A. Like fine with AR, just no bump stocks.
4511 2018-12-20 01:34:26 Markets sank today because investors got too optimistic about Fed policy: the market was pricing in only one half a rate hike in 2019. #JayPowell promises 2 hikes- investors dumped stocks
4512 2018-12-20 01:34:12 Finally: 

If your thesis states Chinese stocks are undervalued compared with US stocks why are you long both with no cash holdings? It seems odd your position doesn’t match your view. I do respect you keep your position public, as it’s important for talking Stock on Twitter
4513 2018-12-20 01:33:38 Nifty should hit 11k.

Don't get caught in any euphoria.

IMO it should react by about 100 to 150 points after hitting mount 11k.

4514 2018-12-20 01:33:32 @Jon_Stocks_IT
4515 2018-12-20 01:32:43 Why isn’t anyone talking about how trump banned bump stocks?
4516 2018-12-20 01:31:58 I remember reading a book called Wealth Without Risk about 25 years ago & the only thing I remember from that book was this statement “When interest rates are low, stocks will grow. When interest rates are high, stocks will die.”
4517 2018-12-20 01:31:06 Bump stocks are now banned. Wow. What a no brainer. What the hell took so long??????????????? Let’s all acting like it’s the most innovative idea. Hello??????
4518 2018-12-20 01:30:33 Also, ATF decided bump stocks were legal. Where did ATF get the power to make that decision? Oh, from Congress--delegating power to agencies to make the rules that run our lives. DO YOUR JOB, @MartinHeinrich. Don't delegate power to unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats,
4519 2018-12-20 01:30:14 From the article , it looks like he is just transferring these stocks with trusted family members or whoever till he's no longer working for this administration. Seems like all the people Trump picked think it's all about how to enrich themselves while serving!
4520 2018-12-20 01:29:23 My SSBM 2018 resume: 
2-1 Over @CakeAssault_ in the Kirby ditto 
Like, 9th at my local once 
Took 3 stocks from @4estSSBM
4521 2018-12-20 01:29:01 Of course he does, he's the one who ordered Trump to do it. Now that Don, Ivanka & Jared think they are heroes re: bill & bump stocks ban they feel emboldened to do Putin's bidding. 45 also lifted sanctions on a Russian oligarchs steel company today. Putin owns the Trumps.
4522 2018-12-20 01:28:20 Or just sell illegal stocks like jordan belfort
4523 2018-12-20 01:28:15 Dang you guys should get stocks in them awesome go get em boys
4524 2018-12-20 01:28:10 Agreed. It is bullish the US economy and stocks in the medium and longer term.
4525 2018-12-20 01:27:38 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @FLOTUS @VP NASDAQ STOCKS DOWN ALL WEEK LONG ? ELITE AT WORK,,YOU NEED TO GIVE EVERY 500 DOLLARS STIMULUS CHECKS ACROSS THE USA LIKE BUSH SON DID TO STIMULATE THE ECONOMY AND TRADE OLD CARS IN FOR 5000 DOLLARS OFF GOVERNMENT PAY TO BUY NEW CARS...
4526 2018-12-20 01:27:29 I could care less about Bump Stocks, myself. What I do care about is the overreach by the Govt. 
If you don't like something, how about passing a law, instead of letting some unelected, Govt. schleps make something illegal.
4527 2018-12-20 01:27:26 @realDonaldTrump MR. PRESIDENT I see you made ‘bump stocks’ illegal and added a law to the books. Can you throw the sheepDOGS a bone and legalize rifle suppressors? This is a MAJOR issue. #hearingprotectionact #secondamendment #makeamericagreatagain #makeaAlawTakeaway3
4528 2018-12-20 01:27:20 Choosing stocks without being educated is a Risk. If you can't weed through the clutter in the markets  you are just gambling... and you'll lose!!

#RichLivesMatter
4531 2018-12-20 01:26:51 THAT little weasel should be PUT in stocks!
4532 2018-12-20 01:26:45 Given tariffs and more US rate hikes, the Chinese economy has not recovered from these devaluations. Similar economic conditions to 2015 may encourage further devaluation and exacerbate Chinese stocks.
4533 2018-12-20 01:26:04 @realDonaldTrump Hey Donald the stocks are doing so good we will get $25 billion to build the wall and it’s because of USMCA deal
4534 2018-12-20 01:25:24 The 10-year U.S. Treasury at 2.75%, lowest level since April, provides less competition for stocks.  Trade policy is a major concern which could lower corporate profits and GDP growth.
4535 2018-12-20 01:25:12 huh how does the NKD arbitrage work exactly? cuz all the big stocks are going up while the index isn't...
4536 2018-12-20 01:24:36 I had this fear a few months earlier. It's like they're oblivious to the world around them. Having said that, I think Twitter and some big stocks were done in blood markets, but they take years to recover
4537 2018-12-20 01:24:26 I am pro second amendment. I think we should be able to own any gun we want. But as for bump stocks? Gimmick. Toy. Should it be banned? No, just another knee jerk reaction. I just don't think it's a hill worth dying on.
4538 2018-12-20 01:24:26 And the DOJ outlawed bump stocks.  Looks like the GOP is feeling the heat.  & the NRA being infiltrated by a Russian Spy to launder cash to the GOP is not helping.

Hope your get out the vote efforts among young people continue to bear fruit.
4539 2018-12-20 01:24:10 Hahahahahaha I love it. The @GOP, @msgop, @PhilBryantMS, and @realDonaldTrump talk so much smack, but then they expand Medicaid as per the ACA, ban bump stocks against the @NRA’s wishes, don’t build the wall, investigate the White House and prosecute the Trump admin, etc.
4540 2018-12-20 01:23:40 I noticed that in spite of this index selloff that a lot of the blue chip stocks held strong. 

Good sign?
4541 2018-12-20 01:23:36 Yeah, they can boycott those companies. In a few weeks their stocks will increase..kinda like the Nike boycott.
4542 2018-12-20 01:23:18 That is the silliest thing to say, lets ban factors... lol a factor is just a way of categorizing investment exposures, lets ban investing in value factor so there is no one to buy stocks when they get beaten up!
4543 2018-12-20 01:23:08 Take that criminals. You can’t use bump-stocks anymore. 

Ohh what’s that? Your still going to use them because criminals don’t care about the rule of law and it’s just another charge to be added. 
4544 2018-12-20 01:22:46 Buying stocks now  in companies that sell ladders 
4545 2018-12-20 01:22:44 Before y’all start buying Ray J glasses make sure y’all buy the stocks for it
4546 2018-12-20 01:21:28 I'm not even caring to defend bump stocks, either.  Still, people paid for them so should not be basically hung upside-down & their investment $$ shaken from their pockets.  That's rather criminal.
4547 2018-12-20 01:21:27 WEALTHY TRICK ON US ..the wealthy sell their stocks when prices are  high while their advisors tell us to hold...then when prices are low, the wealthy have money to buy and we don't because we left all our money in the market during the downturn
4548 2018-12-20 01:20:40 These stocks got me fucked up
4549 2018-12-20 01:20:40 If you put all your stocks it’s gonna look bad lol
4550 2018-12-20 01:20:28 100% correct—home defense is not a good defense for ownership of bump-stocks/slide-fire apparatuses.

But seizure of legally obtained private property without due process and without compensation is.

Besides the fact that the ban helps nothing.
4551 2018-12-20 01:20:21 WEALTHY TRICK ON US ..the wealthy sell their stocks when the prices are high while their advisors tell us to hold...then when prices are low, they have money to buy and we don't because we road out the downturn
4552 2018-12-20 01:20:03 Don't look now, but in the past two days the US has:

Banned bump stocks
Passed criminal justice reform
Pulled troops from Syria
4553 2018-12-20 01:19:53 A trend that I am seeing with the market right now is that we open high and close low almost consistently. With bearish conditions in the market, this pattern is hurting investor sentiment. If we can get a modest open and a positive close we'll be in good shape #investing #stocks
4554 2018-12-20 01:19:51 Seems 2B a rights issue, as the govt would be stealing $$$ citizens legally put into buying bump stocks, if no compensation.   Gun- & "cash for clunkers" auto- buy-back programs included reimbursement, not utter financial loss after the fact by law-abiding citizens.
4555 2018-12-20 01:19:49 That and who the hell really needs a bump stock??!... All it is is a modification that makes money and is the laziest way to shoot a gun... For crying out loud, people are more worried about bump stocks than magazine capacity!... I'll choose a 30 rd mag over a bump stock any day!
4556 2018-12-20 01:19:42 That’s the thought. It’s amazing how the indexes have not seen the carnage of some of the underlying stocks
4557 2018-12-20 01:19:38 This has been a bizarre day. First step act, I have my reservations, bump stocks, no wall, now this . I am not so sure this isn’t progressive!
4558 2018-12-20 01:19:02 Hey hey.  Nothing new just - #Stocks are down again which SUX  not a ticker symbol.  

On the up side, this season of #vikings is pretty good.
4559 2018-12-20 01:18:53 Hey, don't judge me but, bump stocks are kinda fun. I mean, as long as it's not your ammo you're waisting. Or trying to shoot with precision.
4560 2018-12-20 01:18:36 Music was bandage without angry stocks !!
4561 2018-12-20 01:17:47 Rep. Lieu, After their criminal justice bill passed & bans bump stocks he gives Syria to Russia & lifts sanctions on Russian oligarch's steel company. Trumps NEVER do anything gratis. They coordinated w Putin to sell out our country w a kickback for themselves.
4562 2018-12-20 01:17:46 Bump stocks banned with hardly a peep from the #NRA 
4563 2018-12-20 01:17:36 that and... are bump stocks really where we want to draw the line?  really??
4564 2018-12-20 01:17:12 Invest on some good stocks
4565 2018-12-20 01:17:02 And most legal experts would probably also tell you that banning bump stocks is constitutional bc we all know who (((they))) are
4566 2018-12-20 01:16:33 Also only congress has the power to make laws, where were you when Trump signed the unconstitutional executive order to ban bump stocks...oh never mind that flows with the left's agenda.
4567 2018-12-20 01:16:00 DONALD TRUMP is set to sign the #farmbill @ 11:30am tomorrow #hemp #CBD #stocks
$EAST.v is my largest holding in the sector. If you haven’t done any DD. I suggest you do some tonight
4568 2018-12-20 01:16:00 Some people can’t sell their stocks?

Giving 30% to the government!

So 30% corrections are the beginning of pain for the long term’ers.

4569 2018-12-20 01:15:53  The headline should have been “If you can stomach a bit of treason, causing a few cancer deaths and defrauding developing countries then I have some stocks for you!!” - (obviously + there’s the Apple thing a further downside and from what I can tell very little up atm)
4570 2018-12-20 01:15:44 I have an account with interactive brokers for trading stocks.
4571 2018-12-20 01:15:03 Bump stocks do not make a rifle full auto, only 3 round burst fire. And that only if you have an upper quality weapon. I know, i have owned 2 in the past!
4572 2018-12-20 01:14:56 Let me explain something:

Market Dropped due to Fear from the rate hikes

Recall this. When Corporate tax rates dropped,  companies bought back their stocks and bonds

The market slowdown has had a ZERO effect on companies
4573 2018-12-20 01:14:13 It's about time that "Saving" rates move in the direction to where Middle Class Americans can earn money by investing locally and not artificially prop up Wall Street stocks as the only option.
4574 2018-12-20 01:13:46 In the last 48 hours donald has
1) banned bump stocks
2) lightened penalties on nonviolent drug crimes
3) pulled troops out of syria
4) given up on getting funding for the wall.

He's bernie in orange leathery skin.
4575 2018-12-20 01:13:32 The reason being is much of this debt is issued in USD. So major Chinese companies have been on the losing side of the RMB/USD spread for the past six months. This significantly increases cost of capital, and makes cash flow negative Chinese stocks incredibly risky.
4576 2018-12-20 01:13:12 I think we're seeing signs of an implosion, here, between the withdrawal from Syria and the bump stocks and suddenly no spine on his beloved "wall"... or is his base too stupid to see it? #TRE45ON
4577 2018-12-20 01:13:03 Breaking: Democrats now support the legalization of bump stocks
4578 2018-12-20 01:12:42 Up the stocks...
4579 2018-12-20 01:12:35 It's about time that "Saving"  rates move in the direction to where Middle Class Americans can earn money by investing locally and not artificially prop up Wall Street stocks as the only option.
4580 2018-12-20 01:12:30 Wait. He thankfully banned bump stocks. There’s one.

4582 2018-12-20 01:11:52 Of course it is, or Hillary would be executed, the Fed shutdown, the Rothschilds dead and bump stocks not ban. Moron.
4583 2018-12-20 01:11:51 Does this mean 401ks aren’t invested in stocks?
4584 2018-12-20 01:11:46 2 stocks 3 mins es el default?
4585 2018-12-20 01:10:57 That's because @realDonaldTrump needs his stocks to pay off debt he owes to Russia
4586 2018-12-20 01:10:55 I support Trump most of the time, but im not gonna support him in blind faith every time no matter what. Banning bump stocks is one of those times. Thats officially more action for gun control than Obama ever did. Not a good thing.  do however support him pulling out of Syria.
4587 2018-12-20 01:10:39 I was playing Team Battles (Ganondorf, Kind Dedede, Wario & Ridley) and Player 4 got tired of losing several times in a row until he pulled up the most brutal lag switch possible once there were items on the field. His team had 4 stocks remaining by the end of the match LMFAO
4588 2018-12-20 01:10:38 2008 is already here for many stocks.
4589 2018-12-20 01:10:34 Just like he was with FIG, the guy is full of so much self importance that he doesn't give a fuck about anyone or anything but himself, it must be terrible living with him, end of day 99% of stocks are shit and end shit, he just attacks the ones he hates the most
4590 2018-12-20 01:10:31 Now again I ask, explain/prove how banning bump stocks will prevent even one mass shooting. Banning bump stocks will not keep them out of the hands of criminals anymore than banning drugs has.
4591 2018-12-20 01:10:31 Bump Stocks... That should be decided by a Congressional vote (law). I've been a staunch supporter of you,  totally disappointed in you. You may have just irritated the very core that elected you. Big mistake. You should've let Congress do that vs upsetting your core. Big mistake
4592 2018-12-20 01:10:30 Disagree, bump stocks are still out there sugar, and can be made even exact replicas with 3d printing, oh my gosh! Ok for the millionth time automatic weapons have been regulated for decades now. Not many people have them at all.
4593 2018-12-20 01:10:29 Agreed. There’s no plan other than feed us nonsense to make us sit back and wait for things that never happen
4594 2018-12-20 01:10:12 EXCLUSIVE!

4598 2018-12-20 01:09:53 Thanks so replying and fostering civil discussion. To your points:

1) I agree Chinese stocks have may have lower P/E ratios than US stocks, however from a fundamental standpoint many of these stocks are inherently drowning in debt. You won’t see this in tradition debt metrics...
4599 2018-12-20 01:09:48 Sell stocks when everyone is bullish.
4600 2018-12-20 01:09:38 Our local football team used Stocks pound cakes for fundraising. Maybe they can try them after the holidays.
4601 2018-12-20 01:09:03 If Trump doesn't do this Muller will be the least of his problems Russia will have his head. Syria=oil. We need that Oil. Now Trump is lifting sanctions and giving Russia Syria and its oil. The stocks are suffering. Now the price of oil and gas will rise. Russia owns us now.
4602 2018-12-20 01:08:42 Would love for someone to point out to me where in the Constitution bump stocks are mentioned....

4606 2018-12-20 01:07:58 just incase this is a serious question, he lost it in Facebook stocks. the price per share took a big hit, the market generally did too, and he lost +-$15billion. he could regain it as easily as he lost it but people are thinking that Facebook's stock already roofed
4607 2018-12-20 01:07:27 for sure.. They are all idiots for waiting to raise that's for sure. Some of these stocks were 400% higher, but now raise. lol
4608 2018-12-20 01:07:08 I think it’s just readjusting to what it should have been. See, certain people like to take advantage of the mkt when new people come in/join/buy stocks. (“Look how good the economy is doing” mentality.) Pyramid.
4609 2018-12-20 01:07:05 I agree. I use those stocks for a quick grab and dump. Use retail investors to make a little bit.
4610 2018-12-20 01:06:29 I personally have no problem with bump stocks being banned. Fully automatic weapons are heavily regulated. These ad ons basically increase rate of fire. But I do understand that any regulations are a slippery slope.
4611 2018-12-20 01:05:49 Trump has now put a ban on bump stocks starting in 2019, if you don’t know what that is it’s basically something that makes a semi-auto rifle into a fully auto rifle, i think this is what was used in vegas idk, nobody really talking about this so i’d figure id get you woke

4614 2018-12-20 01:04:34 OK, you just tokd us the Couch Potato Portfolio BUT you don’t want C$ ETFs/mutual funds holding foreign  dividend-paying stocks in an RRSP no matter the timeline as you get taxed on those dividends and no tax credit. If held in US$ you’re fine as far as the US$ dividends.
4615 2018-12-20 01:04:30 Tax cuts have changed the earnings of equities but not the sales and growth. Companies have bought back shares have not invested in new projects this late in the cycle (except E&Ps)

Where is the fuel for growth coming from going forward?

g is all that matters to stocks.
4616 2018-12-20 01:04:24 Any suggestions on what stocks to buy w/ not a ton of capital?
4617 2018-12-20 01:04:18 stocks crashing wont be from high rates, it will be from other factors that the fed cant control.  I mean, FF is 2.25. thats not going to cause a crash because credit is too expensive.  stocks still have plenty of room to fall and wont be considered undervalued.
4618 2018-12-20 01:04:16 I guess it doesn’t matter that we have a corrupt president. The middle class tax cut goes away 2020, EPA regulations cuts good or bad who knows. Immigrations just shot down today by courts, Asylum rules shot down by appeals court today, the wall crumbled in Congress today, stocks
4619 2018-12-20 01:04:05 If you're able to manage your 401k investments I strongly suggest looking into something other than stocks. The stock market is in for a potential massive correction next year.
4620 2018-12-20 01:03:54 Shareholders claims are a relation of power over production, not solely a distributional matter. So the idea "assume it is 100% of stocks" seems a crazy way to assume how it will exist and work, especially given how most (e.g. HRC's, Bruenig's) are being sold, but even then, no.
4621 2018-12-20 01:03:52 Yep, no more mass shootings, bump stocks banned!
4622 2018-12-20 01:03:05 Name one time the stocks have gone down and never came back up. In the Great depression and in the 2008 'crash'everyone freaked out and thought the world was ending. Not too long ago we reached a record high. Unless the US as a country fails, then the stocks will go back up
4623 2018-12-20 01:02:45 I need to do something, stocks, a business, trading something. I need to take things up a notch but how 
4624 2018-12-20 01:02:30 Stop with FB and J&J they both could go down more . Thousands of other stocks to own .  J&J went down today before the Feds conference. CNBC had a story about the $4.9 billion dollar verdict . Stop your nonsense.
4625 2018-12-20 01:02:08 Aren't red flag laws at the state level? What does that have to do with him? Bump stocks? Until there is a challenge in the courts pretty much meaningless. Border wall was one of the major issues that got him elected, probably the major issue. Build the wall and keep the job.
4626 2018-12-20 01:02:06 They already own 33% shares of the company of Hulu. Fox owns 33% of Hulu's shares which will be included in the sale to Disney. Making Disney the majority controlling shareholder at 66% of company stocks being owned by them. Not a pipedream at all.
4627 2018-12-20 01:02:04 Stocks ended lower after the Federal Reserve signaled a less aggressive path than it did in September—but still predicted two more rate hikes for 2019.
4628 2018-12-20 01:01:40 Could you please explain how the ban of bump stocks it unconstitutional?
4629 2018-12-20 01:01:35 I need to share your progress too! Get these mad savings before stocks are gone, folks!
4630 2018-12-20 01:00:58 What lives would it save? The only time they were even used, was in Vegas, and the police hanging out in the elevator shaft, instead of stopping him, contributed to more deaths than bump stocks did.
4631 2018-12-20 01:00:26 I need to invest my money in Canadian and American marijuana stocks...
4632 2018-12-20 00:59:43 2019 is the year to work hard and/or borrow as much govt money as possible to buy cheap cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. 

Also optimistic about Nexo, Stellar Lumen and others w/ real value propositions. Borrowing money for overpriced assets like stocks or real estate is madness.
4633 2018-12-20 00:59:39 Jeff, you know by the time Fed reacts with its rear view mirror again as usual, US economy will be already in a recession. But, this was NOT even my point. My point was this stop and go w/o waiting. I believe this was a big mistake and it may very soon crash the stocks...
4634 2018-12-20 00:58:58 It's all QE vapour money. None of it is real. There's only one way stocks are going now.
4635 2018-12-20 00:58:47 The monetary base increased, money didn’t. Therefore money was not created. Reserves are not money and bond sellers cant spend bank reserves to buy stocks and other assets.
4636 2018-12-20 00:56:18 Nationalized most banks after they had bought huge stocks holdings in the aftermath of the great depression, thus basically nationalizing the main italian companies in the 30s. Togliatti (italian communist party leader) in 1936  famously "appealed" to fascists as brothers in arm/
4637 2018-12-20 00:55:27 Hint: The new bump stock ban is NOT about bump stocks.
4638 2018-12-20 00:55:03 laugh at all the suckers who invested in stocks and mutual funds and such instead off spending it on booze. Now your money's gone too and you're sober, LOL
4639 2018-12-20 00:54:51 Definitely want this guy on your business network talking 'bout stocks, particularly for your retiree (54-death) demo.
4640 2018-12-20 00:54:38 You're presuming that stocks are priced on fair valuation. This is not the case. Stocks are priced on HYPE. The people that score big pts on the market, do it psychologically. I short my account. It's much easier to predict when a security is going to tank than boom.
4641 2018-12-20 00:54:24 Also, my stocks are tanking.
4642 2018-12-20 00:54:12 You have to remember that bump stocks were approved under a different President but banned under Trump
4643 2018-12-20 00:53:35 I said the same. And they gave a bonus instead of a permanent raise. Bonuses don’t help towards your income level for calculating social security benefits down the road. So many companies used the tax break to buy back their stocks.
4644 2018-12-20 00:52:38 @_DKwill I just checked again, my rules were on 2 stocks :)...
4645 2018-12-20 00:52:24 Personally I think bump stocks are just a show-off-y way to waste ammo with zero accuracy and by no means would even be useful in a 2nd amendment scope of rebellion.

But this ban is so dumb I want one.
4646 2018-12-20 00:52:17 If they fire Powell ?? Will stocks go down??
4647 2018-12-20 00:52:02 @realDonaldTrump I was a Trump for President supporter BUT I’m beginning to have my doubts!  You sign a declaration to take bump stocks from law abiding citizens, what next?  My Guns?
4648 2018-12-20 00:52:01 They are mad because all the stocks they have won’t make them more money now
4649 2018-12-20 00:51:18 @realDonaldTrump I have been a very loyal supporter of yours from the get go. I have put up with a lot from the left because I knew you‘d be great for America. In one action you have lost my support and future vote. Banning bump stocks was dumb. I’m sure I’m not the only.
4650 2018-12-20 00:51:10 Omg lol i once when against someone like that and ended up making them ragequit by taking 2 of his stocks with mario’s forward air x3
4651 2018-12-20 00:50:32 real reason is the stocks markets going to crash?an chaos is going to break out so we need the troops when marshawl law is delcared?Could put them on the border?
4652 2018-12-20 00:50:32 On the home front ...the other nite Mike Savage said there would b a stock market Crash in yr 2019 \ market is already 400 points negative 2day\advice stock up on NON-- Parishables bc No $ out there\ layoffs big business already selling off stocks w\out employees permission\PRose
4653 2018-12-20 00:50:19 While I am extremely pro-2A, it’s hard to support bump stocks.  There was a time when conservatives and liberals alike drew a line at automatic weapons.  A semi-auto with a bump stock is almost indistinguishable in function from a full auto, barring an insignificant technicality
4654 2018-12-20 00:50:18 Stocks are much easier to trade and should have some long term investment there I think
4655 2018-12-20 00:50:17 but they arent reacting to stocks, as they shouldnt,, thats the point. if the fed has to cut rates, its due to other factors like a global slowdown due to a trade war, rise in unemployment, or collapse in inflation.  and not solely because stocks are falling
4656 2018-12-20 00:50:16 Yeah it's a conspiracy lol. It's easy to think that way.  If the fed stopped hikes the market would become overvalued quick.  I think raising today was fine but they don't need to do 3 next year.  Also people need to quit buying stocks and making them overvalued
4657 2018-12-20 00:49:57 Who the fuck uses a bump stock? Unless you're into spraying crowds what are they good for? Hell, go down to the range and lease the real thing. You'll never go back to bump stocks.
4658 2018-12-20 00:49:44 I was a Trump for President supporter BUT I’m beginning to have my doubts!  You sign a declaration to take bump stocks from law abiding citizens, what next?  My Guns?
4659 2018-12-20 00:49:42 Will be interesting to see how long we wait until first corporate dips a toe into US stocks. I think if you are publicly traded the risks are too great before a states act like bill passes at a minimum.
4660 2018-12-20 00:49:30 #BumpStockBan 
Bump stocks are the new #DontAskDontTell
but I'll be honest I'll rat ya out so don't let me see it, i'm not asking to see it, don't tell me you have it and all will be happy.
4661 2018-12-20 00:49:07 Diversify your assets! Actually can be good news for people buying stocks too. Buy at cheaper prices.
4662 2018-12-20 00:48:53 I’ve recently had the pleasure of discussing the role of government with a libertarian [anarchist variant] and found the substance illuminating. There are several acquaintances I’ve met protesting the inability of the NRA to prevent the banning of bump stocks...
4663 2018-12-20 00:48:44 @bigBIOboom @wolverine123 I am down to 2 stocks! EGHT steady play and CLSN my lotto play, and you know you never hit lotto,It’s someone else
4664 2018-12-20 00:48:33 stocks rallying Asia time again I’m struggling to even laugh now
4665 2018-12-20 00:48:30 There is clear evidence of chlorine attacks. NATO means nothing. US & Britain both have stocks of chemical & biological.
4666 2018-12-20 00:47:48 Bump stocks aren't registered, are they? How do they KNOW who owns them? 

Are they counting on the honor system? 

They're hoping the populous is more honorable than they.
4667 2018-12-20 00:46:59 How can you disagree with a fact?There’s no such thing as thin air credit. Bond managers can sell their treasuries at any time to anyone, without the Fed, and when they do they don’t buy stocks. With all due respect, everything you said was fantasy land and not the real world.
4668 2018-12-20 00:46:45 Maybe they can glue the bump stocks together into a wall.
4669 2018-12-20 00:46:36 We have that option. I really need to allocate some time for dealing with my 401ks. And it’s only like 85% stocks. I prefer 90-95%.
4670 2018-12-20 00:46:29 Stock market where teachers' pensions are suppose to go.  This year, we still got our pensions but otherwise lost money for 12 months.  NO INCREASE from our 401Ks & stocks.  Don't know what will go 1st, our 'stocks' or our pensions.  I guess I'll become a Costco greeter.
4671 2018-12-20 00:46:04 I think it’s widely known that most people want sensible gun laws and restrictions. We’re not living in the Wild West any longer. Bump Stocks just got the axe...that’s progress. There’s plenty on the table we can do. A ban on automatic weapons, etc.
4672 2018-12-20 00:44:53 Good things happen when you elect Democrats...You gave them the house and things are happening...We actually got a Bipartisan Bill Passed, and Bump Stocks Ban...Shows the GOP is guilty AF and trying to stay out of JAIL,
4673 2018-12-20 00:44:04 mark my word, small will be smaller, big will be bigger as money moving from small to big, this is the trending of $pot stocks
4674 2018-12-20 00:43:49 @jimcramer Real economy is very strongly correlated (with a lag) with equity prices. 80% of C-Suite comp is stock-based and when stocks tank, C-Suite loses money. The effect is lay-offs, reduced Opex/Capex to boost stock prices. In capitalism, labor suffers when capital suffers.
4675 2018-12-20 00:43:09 With the ban on bump stocks Trump has set a precedent that will encourage crazy dems to ban all sorts of things.  I can no longer support Trump.  Not sure how you can.
4676 2018-12-20 00:43:07 Lol and these are only two stocks i never touched 
4677 2018-12-20 00:42:31 agreed.. his lost salary is not trade off.. and yes, I do have money invested in stocks, and yes, I do have a stand to complain..
4678 2018-12-20 00:42:29 Maybe the real reason is the stocks markets going to crash?an chaos is going to break out so we need the troops when marshawl law is delcared?
4679 2018-12-20 00:42:13 The government owns stocks to sell?
4680 2018-12-20 00:41:49 It depends on the hold period. Some stocks tempt to go through a long period of being undervalued (buying opportunity) followed by discovery period whereas the opposite happens & they get pricey (selling opportunity). The time span is different from one Co to the other.
4681 2018-12-20 00:41:29 thank god my stocks are back up whew
4682 2018-12-20 00:41:04 Also ensure you have adequate food/water stocks especially for your pets.
4683 2018-12-20 00:40:56 I read they were suing to get compensation for ppl who bought bump stocks after ATF initially found them legal. I don't think they are suing to keep them out there.
4684 2018-12-20 00:40:36 That's not clarification, it's obfuscation.

Trump and the AG's department have no authority to make law.

Machine guns are defined in law passed by Congress, and only Congress can change that.

The legal definition is not vague, it is clear, and it does not include bump stocks.
4685 2018-12-20 00:40:07 Nope, stopped posting on stocks I hold pretty much, only seen as a die hard pump master, just silently following the herds 
4686 2018-12-20 00:39:58 But didn’t he say we just caught 10 terroists at the border? It’s not over Trump is weak on national security and he banned bump stocks so we can’t defend ourselves from the terrorists at the border plus ISIS and MS-13. Do you support Americans being killed by Trump’s terrorists?
4687 2018-12-20 00:39:07 If you give a look back at 2018 for the financial Markets, 
Everything was good until,.. the September struck,

4688 2018-12-20 00:39:06 If it goes beyond bump stocks, the aforementioned will be its fate.  Do you doubt it?
4689 2018-12-20 00:38:31 Worth noting that by the end of the year Trump will have banned bump stocks, passed criminal justice reform, and begun pulling out of Syria. Conservatives are certainly split on the last two (maybe all three?), but right now Trump is moving left with a Dem House one month away.
4690 2018-12-20 00:37:38 How about the “small dick” defense for bump stocks?
4691 2018-12-20 00:37:07 Are the chuds losing their shit because trump is coming to take their bump stocks? Muh 2a 
It’s hilarious because they thought for sure Obama was coming to take their guns but it ended being their boy instead.
4692 2018-12-20 00:36:59 Yeah, what happened?? I had it planned that I’d cash out my weed stocks Oct 16 and go into bank/insurance stocks as a low-risk place to park my money for 3-6 months. And they drop like everything else. Dang it!!!
4693 2018-12-20 00:36:44 $SPY IMHO 5 -6point rally due in Spy. Dont be surprised.  Not going to straight to 0. Lol Some stocks showed good relative strength today
4694 2018-12-20 00:36:34 Dont buy weed stocks
4695 2018-12-20 00:36:34 Probably. At least we're keeping Deng as our defensive stocks aren't great at the moment.
4696 2018-12-20 00:36:05 If Trump wants to make bump stocks illegal, is Obama still coming for our guns?
4697 2018-12-20 00:35:37 Language is important. If you're going to say any etf is going to act like the telecom etf's that have Verizon and AT@T as there dominant two stocks and therefore performance will mimic those, ok, but that's not the case with SKYY. Get it right or get called on it! Journalist!
4698 2018-12-20 00:35:25 Yes the Bots are long stocks individual names unhedged.
4699 2018-12-20 00:35:23 I am keeping my Bump Stocks, and there isn't anything you can do about it @realDonaldTrump

Merry Christmas.

4701 2018-12-20 00:35:06 A nice roundtrip in #Stocks and a hiking #FED do not mean #EURUSD is ever leaving its 1.13/1.14 range. It’s getting boring, isn‘t it?
4702 2018-12-20 00:34:50 Y'all dumb as hell for believing Kylie got $900M in cash, assets, stocks, etc.
4703 2018-12-20 00:34:39 @realDonaldTrump banned bump-stocks. He didn't need your help. There was no "we".
4704 2018-12-20 00:34:39 Je viens de lire vite fait . En gros c’est peut être juste bon pour l’économie de l’aluminium ils vont pouvoir écouler les stocks pour qu’il se fasse des chapeaux
4705 2018-12-20 00:34:25 Yup did you see stocks fall or what? Wow he's the worst !
4706 2018-12-20 00:34:22 The defense stocks will continue to suffer until the wall is built. No blood money for war hawks while our borders are undefended (and hopefully no more blood money ever again).
4707 2018-12-20 00:34:13 Syria Trump is all over the place, Saying Screw The Wall, Banning Bump Stocks, Pushing the First Step Act, Pulling Troops Out Of Syria, Lifting Sanction On Firms Owned by Putin's Boy Oligarch Deripaska. Some Bizarre Shid Going on Here.

4709 2018-12-20 00:33:30 At your age, don’t sell your stocks because of fear. They will come back up. Keep a diversified portfolio - an index fund would be fine.

4713 2018-12-20 00:31:43 After a Fed Rate increase, as STOCK MARKET money runs away from stocks,(stock value dropped) money runs toward BOND market, increasing BOND VALUE &BOND RATE OF RETURN, increasing MORTGAGE RATES which are based onBOND RATE OF RETURN, plus a MARGIN

4715 2018-12-20 00:31:31 @steveliesman Liesman: real economy is very strongly correlated with equity prices. 80% of C-Suite comp is stock-based and when stocks tank, C-Suite loses money. The effect is lay-offs, reduced Opex/Capex to boost stock prices. In capitalism, labor suffers when capital suffers.
4716 2018-12-20 00:31:18 Yeah I dont understand why Americans can't own bump stocks but We will sell real "assault rifles" to foriegners who in turn use them against our military men and women after the fact! Total BS.
4717 2018-12-20 00:30:59 Heard someone on @kfbk the other day arguing the point that people aren't going to surrender their bump stocks under the new law and will instead sell them on the black market. So much for those "law abiding gun owners..."
4718 2018-12-20 00:30:56 Weed stocks up tomorrow
4719 2018-12-20 00:30:55 Value stocks are about as exciting as watching grass grow, but have you ever noticed just how much your grass grows in a week. Till the time business is growing @20%+ CAGR, stay invested.

4720 2018-12-20 00:30:48 Bump stocks do not duplicate fully automatic fire, it's nowhere near as effective. People who have not experienced both modes of fire should not comment on this subject.  Bottom line, bump stocks should not be banned and would be great for home defense in many situations.
4721 2018-12-20 00:30:48 $BTC nice rally off our $3,200 support, short term correction or higher now?? Stocks new lows as expected, what’s next?
4722 2018-12-20 00:30:02 The #markets are unforgiving, and emotional #trading always results in losses. #forex #stocks
4723 2018-12-20 00:29:45 Yup.  There is some silver lining - sentiment sucks, lower bond yields good for stocks (was a headwind), good for housing.  Maybe the dollar rolls over - good for multi nationals.  All of those are good table setters when the dust settles and resets some headwinds ML
4724 2018-12-20 00:29:45 God bless you. Not a fan of bump stocks or other alterations like them. But when does the infringement stop?

4726 2018-12-20 00:29:36 “US stocks are on track for their biggest December decline since the Great Depression in 1931.”

Trump can change the rot wit a trade deal with the Chinese. I think it’s inevitable it will happen for him to boost confidence and get a second term in office. It will happen in 2019
4727 2018-12-20 00:29:09 This is a huge victory! Because bump stocks are such a widespread thing, said no one.
4728 2018-12-20 00:29:09 Federal Reserve Cuts its Outlook For U.S. Economy; stocks plunge.

4729 2018-12-20 00:28:48 Mr. President Trump are you going to keep your word and over turn this Ban you signed because the people who own Bump Stocks are asking what are you going to do with the people who Refuse to turn in their Bump Stocks are you going to send SWAT teams to arrest good people

4737 2018-12-20 00:26:45 AGREE! I did not hear single chant of release the prisoners or ban bump stocks. If he doesn’t start using his veto pen he will be toast. I could care less about bipartisan infrastructure... that’s a dem win just like the omnibus. I see Trump as last or only hope @realDonaldTrump
4738 2018-12-20 00:24:51 How many mass shootings have bump stocks been used in that you can name? How many mass shootings have happened since bump stocks have been created, you have no facts and spew . Leave the conversation, go study the migration of worms in east Australia. It better suites you.
4739 2018-12-20 00:24:35 My stock market strategy will still be to take 1% out of bonds and buy dividend yielding stocks each 1% the #SP500 goes down for a while.  But I am eventually going to get greedy and start going after 2021 calls very aggressively for growth.  I just don't know when.
4740 2018-12-20 00:23:25 The US had to fund its own deficits.  Effectively, the US can do this, but not w/o selling lots of stocks.

4749 2018-12-20 00:19:55 You aren't pro second amendment if you support banning bump stocks. After this gun grabbers are just going to try to ban something else
4750 2018-12-20 00:19:44 In the meantime,  I believe that tech, EM and European bank stocks are going to rally for a month or two from current levels, and those rallies could be 10-15%.

I've learnt so much from you,  John and not just about finance. Also about the way one cares for non Neuro typicals.
4751 2018-12-20 00:19:22 Why have treasury yields gone lower and lower for decades? What has caused the lack of liquidity in stocks?
4752 2018-12-20 00:19:22 FUCK THEY BANNED BUMP STOCKS
4753 2018-12-20 00:19:17 I added some OTC stocks to my portfolio in preparation for the #FarmBill though they’re volatile, it seems like the right move. HEMP Inc. being one of them. Already moving up nicely. #StockMarket #investor
4754 2018-12-20 00:19:05 Trump made it perfectly legal for me to take all the bump stocks from the Whos down in Whoville.
4755 2018-12-20 00:19:05 More than $1.4 trillion of equity value has been zapped in the worst year for Asia tech stocks in a decade.
4756 2018-12-20 00:18:48 I'm not overly bullish on Li, it's no longer in the hype phase so growth of the price will be slower, as a results Li related stocks will be slower also.  I'm looking elsewhere for the next emerging hot sectors.

4761 2018-12-20 00:16:46 Yup! Gotta love those High beta stocks. Moves well in bull markets but weak as fuck if markets dump more. Doesn’t mean there isn’t long term potential and bullishness in the next 5 years but can’t fight the market if it keeps 
4762 2018-12-20 00:16:12 What does the liquidity of UST have to do with stocks?
4763 2018-12-20 00:15:52 Honestly, I'm not sure what support to give him. Trump holds the 
Veto Pen. He has yet to veto Omnibus, minibus, PP funding...  Now banning bump stocks and jailbreak is up next.
You would think if he wanted voters support, he would have given his base something in 2 years.
4764 2018-12-20 00:15:45 So I listened to two grown men lament over Laverne and Shirley actress’s death and a tirade over NFL disappointments for nearly an hour at work today.  Fascist Trump, DOJ, Bump stocks?... they ain’t got shit to say... Fags!
4765 2018-12-20 00:15:26 Agree! Bag holders will always try to justify their bull case no matter what. Fundamentals doesn't matter when overall market is weak. Speculative stocks are mostly driven by hype during the bull market and fear during the bear market which is why they are the best ones to short.

4767 2018-12-20 00:15:08 That is what CNN news and Mr. Cramer said, they had never seen this for over 10 years. I and my friends all put "Hold". However, the market does not respond that way...That means, most people move the fund out of the stocks to bond or CD(FDIC)...FED does hurt the bull market.

4769 2018-12-20 00:15:01 Making sure no one has bump stocks over there
4770 2018-12-20 00:14:59 Worst December since 1931. US stocks at 14x and European stocks below 12x 2019 earnings. Assuming we are near peak rates, this is not expensive unless earnings collapse. Millenials better get used to new/more normal market environment. #Powell
4771 2018-12-20 00:14:32 No way, man and I was so sure that all the gang members & criminals would've also turned in their extended mags along with the bump stocks. Maybe that haven't seen the law yet, what if they put up a sign like at the "Gun Free Zones" surely that should work. It's fail proof!
4772 2018-12-20 00:14:15 Lol Not talking about bumb stocks lol But hey, I can tell you got D's and F's in school for not paying attention. Lol That's what happens you rush to run your mouth at someone. Lol

4775 2018-12-20 00:13:01 1/ Also - stocks needed to maintain the bid in housing.  10,000 Boomers a day selling houses, need a good price to fund their retirement.  If they sell w/no equity...yikes.  Also, as a friend in FL said to me a couple yrs ago...
4776 2018-12-20 00:12:49 Are we in the buy stocks with accidental high yields phase yet?
4777 2018-12-20 00:12:32 Everything is slowing... Rate hikes will only make it worse

You want to buy stocks when earnings are going to miss?
4778 2018-12-20 00:12:24 They were watching their defense stocks go up in value.
4779 2018-12-20 00:12:24 Haha and then Trump banned bump stocks!  Thanks Obama
4780 2018-12-20 00:12:21 Whether it's bump stocks or anything else, legislation should be passed through Congress.
4781 2018-12-20 00:11:40 Cheap stocks aren't good and Good stocks aren't cheap.
4782 2018-12-20 00:11:05 I get what your saying but the point I am making is that bump stocks is not and cannot make your weapon full auto the rate of fire is not the same even the ex ATF director agreed on this .

4789 2018-12-20 00:05:46 @kairyssdal After your comments about the costs of today's rate increase followed by the FedEx conf call, I had this question: of the stocks that were buoyed by buybacks, how many of them are below the pre-buyback price now that the market is dropping?  (I hate buybacks)

4792 2018-12-20 00:04:30 You know Hillary lost. Why not talk about kneeling? Or how the Trumps abused their foundation? Or (thank god) Kelli ward was not the R senator to lose to Sinema. Or bump stocks. Or the new crime bill. Explore, Einstein.
4793 2018-12-20 00:04:20 Bump stocks are the vape pens of the gun world, just sayin.
4794 2018-12-20 00:03:53 The argument that weed stocks are “recession proof” because people consume weed in bad times anyway has to be one of the dumbest I’ve ever heard. It should be quite clear by now pretty much all stocks will go where the whole market goes, especially speculative stocks.
4795 2018-12-20 00:03:33 It's all a ploy. They'll go right back. Just like he was pro 2A then bans bump stocks lmfao.
4796 2018-12-20 00:03:18 Tengo los mejores de los mejores stocks
4797 2018-12-20 00:03:00 which stocks aren't acting like crap?
4798 2018-12-20 00:02:50 Index funds are about as good as paying some one to manage your money too. When the market is going well stocks are better but if you're going to be that active you need to spend time managing it yourself.
4799 2018-12-20 00:02:19 How defining "worst?"  It seems like the best method would be how much an average investor, invested in a basket of stocks, would lose during the period. Using points is deceptive since index prices are so high. Not sure index % would be correct either, but haven't done the math.
4800 2018-12-20 00:02:11 Yea definitely Unc. Let me know when you are free. Acorns is a really cool concept. However, with acorns, you are investing into exchange traded funds (ETFs) and not necessarily individual stocks. With Robinhood, you have the option to invest in stocks, funds, options, etc
4801 2018-12-20 00:01:26 Idk but most of my stocks got bumped downward this week
4802 2018-12-20 00:01:19 Did I just hear that Stocks in suppliers of YELLOW VESTS just went up???
4803 2018-12-20 00:00:33 Sorry US government, it appears we've lost our bump stocks in a boating accident 
4804 2018-12-20 00:00:09 On the bright side, stocks are tanking.
4805 2018-12-20 00:00:08 Absolutely right...the argument for bump stocks is that ALL GUN LAWS ARE INFRINGEMENT...period!
