2 2018-02-13 23:54:59 @POTUS Love the idea of stopping food stamp, EBT cards. 50’s 60’s called Commodities, best butter & cheese ever, on my grandmothers home made rolls. Tired of people, with immaculate nails,expensive tattoos, designer clothes, expensive cars, pulling out their food stamp cards.
3 2018-02-13 23:52:51 stop calling it a Blue Apron style replacement. This is big government choosing what people eat. These are government commodities-government cheese and canned meat. They won't be using the actual Blue Apron. GOP is against Big Gov, but want to control what ppl do with their body
4 2018-02-13 23:51:10 I'm forced to shop at Walmart because it's the only place in town that sells commodities, i.e. some medical supplies, automotive & household stuff, and electronics. But if I have my druthers it's Fred Meyers across the street, but mine is solely a grocers. not department store.
5 2018-02-13 23:50:48 I remember back in my parents day, there were no food stamps, or welfare checks..all gov. commodities, flour, baking soda/powder, butter, powdered milk, canned pork, macaroni..gov. cheese..we fortunately never had to use it, my best friend did..his mother was very creative.
6 2018-02-13 23:49:35 interesting proposal.  William F. Buckley wrote a column with a similar proposal.  He advocated ending biological hunger versus gourmet hunger by providing bulgur wheat, lard, and two other commodities required to sustain a person to anyone who wanted them.
7 2018-02-13 23:49:17 I have been saying for years - back to commodities.  I remember geting rice, beans, eggs, cheese, dry milk, peanut butter, canned meats.......  My mother cooked with those and we were grateful for the full belly.  Nobody sold their commodities - they fed their children!
8 2018-02-13 23:46:20 I think they should go back to Gov Commodities. A box with cheese, peanut butter, powered eggs, powered milk, canned meat etc. No fluff,No cheating, no hungry people.
9 2018-02-13 23:46:02 Going backwards in time to the old commodities program.  Poor ppl stood in line to get powdered milk and peanut butter.
10 2018-02-13 23:45:40 Well, I happen to live in an area where you have few choices. The nicer grocery stores are very small and don't have commodities at all, and they are a lot pricier. People who are poor often have only Walmart as their choice. They arrive by bus. So most people I know, shop there.
11 2018-02-13 23:45:36 Well Amazon can't even make a package delivery right what's the benefit of this massive mail out of commodities ...
12 2018-02-13 23:43:51 I have lived they the era of "commodities",a similar program. We got surplus that farmers couldn't sell. Powdered milk that wouldn't dissolve, corn meal, beans, canned fish and meat that was just offal (not spelled wrong). Don't do it again.
13 2018-02-13 23:43:23 "the commodities"
14 2018-02-13 23:43:13 @POTUS So what are you suggesting ?commodities,same as the American Indians get? A lot of certain races you will find Will n it eat this, I Have, it is a lot lot like rations, we who starve are not too proud to eat.
15 2018-02-13 23:43:03 I like the idea. Sounds like commodities. My guess would be it would be all whole grains fruits and veggies.
16 2018-02-13 23:40:27 Back to COMMODITIES! Food box to include govt cheese, beans, can ham, potatoes!!! !
17 2018-02-13 23:39:57 ...I think I know what you were going for, but just in case, black women aren't commodities.
18 2018-02-13 23:38:46 Y'all are over here talking about limiting what people can buy with SNAP to force good choices while Trump is talking about taking away choice and forcing people on SNAP to eat a limited diet of commodities. Commodity foods aren't fresh fruits and veg.
19 2018-02-13 23:37:56 @realDonaldTrump I like the idea of changing the food stamp program. To sending whole sale food items to recepients. I get S.S.I. therefore I do not receive food stamps. But I grew up on commodities. People buy way too many snacks and in healthy food. This is a great deal.

40 2018-02-13 23:37:53 I don't think people get what 18+ feet of sea level rise means. Coastal cities going underwater is THE LEAST concerning thing about it. Flood plains flooded = disease, pests, unclean all kinds of commodities & products you don't even want to begin thinking of before eating.

42 2018-02-13 23:37:27 Google "commodities" program from the 60's or 70's. It was similar in concept to the food box. Hate to disappoint those who live to punish the disadvantaged, but people were creative--they just bartered the commodities for what they wanted. It'll be the same with the food boxes.

44 2018-02-13 23:35:33 Nothing wrong with providing commodities, food banks also give out food, cut food stamp eligible products!
I’ve seen em use EBT card to buy a coke & use cash to buy cigarettes!!
45 2018-02-13 23:35:01 @karenfinerman Hello again or still. In 1970 Merill Lynch called and asked me to be it's commodities guy in Las Vegas. While I kept my securities license, I was a trader and licensed CTA for the rest of my career. I represented Dean Witter,E.F Hutton, Paine Webber all gone but ML
46 2018-02-13 23:33:26 It is once again the return to the bad old days. These food packages before food stamps were called “commodities” government cheese, raisins, powdered eggs & milk, canned meat and peanut butter that the poor had to stand in lines hours to get. This is insane and inhumane!
47 2018-02-13 23:32:41 Government commodities, ugh my heart hurts. I remember canned chicken and government cheese. America, you get to improve your situation by 2.4% per year, unless you are on the bottom trying to work your way up. The very top have convinced the middle that the bottom has too much.

49 2018-02-13 23:32:17 My wife’s family used commodities, as well as stopping at the produce stand to buy whatever soon to be rotten fruit and vegetables they were offering for sale before they tossed them. Her dad worked his entire life at one company plus various PT 2nd jobs. Just not enough 4 3 kids
50 2018-02-13 23:31:56 It wouldn't be. They're talking about #Commodities boxes which contain: powdr milk, powdr mash potatoes, dry beans & rice, tuna,wheat pasta & bread, pnut butter, jelly, tuna, tomato juice, 2lb Velveeta cheese. No fresh fruit, veggies, meat. Doesn't involve farmers at all. #SNAP
51 2018-02-13 23:22:54 To time the next leg Lower on $dxy Dollar index I’ll keep an eye on commodities rally 

Hint- China steel production restrictions expire in March 

What do you need for steel?
#ironore !
Who has it?
Australia!!
What else you need?
Coking coal!
Who has it?
Australia!!!
52 2018-02-13 23:20:36 Exactly! This is an insanely cruel thing to do. It would be a bit different if they proposed that at least 1/2 the SNAP benefits be spent on healthy staple foods. But a box of USDA surplus commodities isn't going to do anything for poverty stricken families.
53 2018-02-13 23:19:49 Years ago, it was called commodities.  Needy folks lined up to be given "government" food.  No choice, but humiliating.
54 2018-02-13 23:17:56 Worked with commodities years ago. People had to work for a living, commodities helped with the groceries. No cheating the system like they do today
55 2018-02-13 23:15:30 Does anyone remember Commodities? The 70s I believe.
56 2018-02-13 23:12:52 it's not ignorance, it's apathy - these hateful greedy sociopathic #corporatocracy #cons cranks & cronies simply don't care about people or planet (unless it affects their own empty shells' comfort level) Living beings, #nature R just #commodities, 'things' 2 use & 2 extract from

58 2018-02-13 23:08:46 A commodities box will contain surplus items that are likely not going to be as healthful or nutritious for the majority of their recipients as the blue apron boxes would be. And in the rural areas, food delivery may indeed be an issue.
This is a bad idea and should be rejected!
59 2018-02-13 23:07:35 As soon as a pedophile gets out of jail, he will head for a park or school so he can proposition a child. Children aren't commodities to be sold or discarded. That needs to be stopped.
60 2018-02-13 23:07:21 I agree that prospects are used for known commodities. But not for odorizzi. Dude pitched to a 4.14 era and 5.43 FIP and 5.10 xFIP. He’s not much better(if at all) than shoemaker, Skaggs, Heaney, jc Ramirez, bridwell, and tropeano. We have 9-10 starters for 6 spots,
61 2018-02-13 23:05:23 @realDonaldTrump I think it’s time to bring back commodities. Give food stamps for meat only.
62 2018-02-13 23:04:55 @realDonaldTrump if you limit people on #FOODSTAMPS to "commodity boxes" you are cutting them off from essential nutrition. You cant replace fruit and vegetables with processed salt and sugar "commodities". Without proper nutrition people develop /exacerbate health conditions.
63 2018-02-13 23:01:22 COMMODITIES!!! Go back to commodities.... good ol govt cheese, beans, can ham, potatoes!  Oh yeah, back to basics. No cash card.
64 2018-02-13 23:00:20 Back in the 60s, my dad had a nickname for them “Happy Pappys”, the worked at city & state jobs & received commodities-which encouraged them to find work quick.  Dad said they were happy to be able to provide food for their families until they could find work.  It was respectable
65 2018-02-13 22:59:04 It was America 60 years ago before the food stamp program when poor people received exactly those same commodities, along with a block of real cheese. Learn some history.
66 2018-02-13 22:58:51 Abolitionist Wm Lloyd Garrison on Blizzard of 1888: A cyclone or blizzard has many of the attributes of a protective tariff. It is a barrier to the free interchange of commodities. It produces scarcity & enhances prices. It profits a few at the expense of the many.
67 2018-02-13 22:56:25 Blegh. But of course, "good guys" every day are indifferent to animal suffering. Animals are entirely disposable commodities and torturing them is fine by our current moral standards. Unless they're soft and cute--we still don't care, we just don't want to know about it then.
68 2018-02-13 22:56:14 Bring back commodities. Free cheese, powdered milk, peanut butter and butter, also other items. Take pop/soda and junk food out of the food stamp program. You want that pay cash. Basically back to the old way!
69 2018-02-13 22:54:55 Good thing for grains and other commodities as the Dollar favors lower to 89.15 this week
70 2018-02-13 22:53:42 I’ve eaten government food when I was a kid and my family was on hard times. It’s humiliating. It was called “commodities” and it wasn’t very good. #TrumpFoodBoxPlan
71 2018-02-13 22:52:53 This is a throwback of the commodities my grandparents used to get.  There's nothing "Blue Apron" about it.  Blue Apron is for fresh proteins and veg.  Trump's plan will have nothing but peanut butter, powdered milk (yummm), gov. cheese and canned foods.
72 2018-02-13 22:52:47 Odorizzi is the way to go. Prospects are commodities that help you acquire players who are known quantities. #Angels are deep in OF prospects, moreso with their 3 MLB starting OF signed long-term. The time is now.
73 2018-02-13 22:52:18 #SNAP plan= #Disaster  No plan for millions w/ #FoodAllergies Commodities boxes now R "#peanutbutter, milk/cheese, grains/cereals/pasta-- all #wheat,  dry beans, canned meat/poultry/fish- usu have wheat/soy. No fresh fruits/ veggies. No food for #gluten,  #lactose, #nut, ppl
74 2018-02-13 22:50:58 Like I just stated. I remember as a kid in the 60's when my mom took us with her to Welfare in Baltimore and we received food staples in White Boxes and cans. Then as 2nd Class in the Navy in the 80's Food Stamps. I was embarrassed at the time. They call it commodities today.
75 2018-02-13 22:50:04 As an industry there are lots of potential avenues for risk management. It's worthwhile that the milk industry looks to other commodities or countries for inspiration.
76 2018-02-13 22:46:19 I remember the days of what is being called "food boxes". I remember as a kid when my mom took us all with her to Welfare and we were given food staples in White Boxes and cans. I think they call it commodities now days.
77 2018-02-13 22:42:26 @TheFive The program for receiving food was referred to as Commodities. The cheese and butter were the best but didn’t like powdered eggs
78 2018-02-13 22:40:39 I will put this out until I am blue in the face.

COMMODITIES. What has been given out for YEARS to supplement in some states FOOD STAMPS.

BUTTER.
CEREAL.
CORN MEAL.
CANNED BEEF OR PORK.
HIGH FAT BLOCK CHEESE.
POTATOTES.

Purpose is clear.
79 2018-02-13 22:40:31 My grandmother loved her commodities - seemed to be a great program back then. Commodity cheese - mmmmmmmm.
80 2018-02-13 22:38:59 Its called "commodities". People on welfare used to go to a Food Stamp warehouse, & they would load you Up withlots of Good Food.  #FoodBoxes. Food Stamp reform is a Great idea! #TheFive @FoxNews @JuanWilliams-You know that Food stamp fraud is more than you said! 
81 2018-02-13 22:38:34 Well said.  This practice was SOP prior to the 1950s.  My grandparents had to line up during the  worst years of the Great Depression to get what was called at that time "commodities."  When work finally came, they didn't need to take other people's charity any more.
82 2018-02-13 22:37:35 COMMODITIES
83 2018-02-13 22:37:35 Si el plan servia para estirar todo 6 meses, había una suba de los commodities argy del 25% y con un año del 40%... igual, nadie lo sabrá
84 2018-02-13 22:36:53 COMMODITIES.
These are COMMODITIES.
Which in some states SUPPLEMENT FOOD STAMPS.
85 2018-02-13 22:36:30 Yes, commodities loved the farina THOUGH!
86 2018-02-13 22:36:18 @FoxNews Giving boxes of food to the poor & needy, rather than food stamps is not a new idea. It is what we did in the 50's & 60's; it was called, "commodities". #TheFive
87 2018-02-13 22:36:04 Reminds me of the commodities (surplus food) that people could get in the ‘50s & ‘60s.  Thanks to a friend on it, I discovered yellow grits, but otherwise I was happy to be employed and not in need.  A 10 lb bag of grits is a whole lot of grits.
88 2018-02-13 22:34:07 I remember my grandpa used to get commodities from the government back in the day. Meats, cheese, canned goods. Absolutely nothing wrong with that and he loved it. Or they need stricter regulations on the crap (candy, colas) they can be allowed to buy with EBT - Ridiculous.
89 2018-02-13 22:33:57 Commodities.
It is a COMMODITY BOX.
90 2018-02-13 22:32:21 They use to do that, was called commodities, commodity cheese butter & peanut butter, came in containers marked USDA cheese & etc.
91 2018-02-13 22:32:15 Your WRs are ok, but not spectacular, to me you take the Best rookie RB situation available and roll, I normally side with proven commodities, by you need the RB help IMO (Arms)
92 2018-02-13 22:32:09 Bring back commodities, never have i had better cheese since then, it was good, basic and cheap (cheese,rice,beans,canned pork powder milk, flour, cornmeal, canned veggies, salt, sugar, cornflakes,peanut butter and honey)
93 2018-02-13 22:28:39 Prior to the 1950s, people getting "relief" lined up to get  "commodities" of cheese, spam, oil, flour, sugar and the like.  It wasn't meant to be gourmet eating.  People need to put their shoulders to the wheel and push themselves out of having to beg for food.
94 2018-02-13 22:26:39 I remember my great grandma whowas widowed young and two sons died in WW II had food she called commodities. A bag of flour in white paper and the only word on it was flour.
95 2018-02-13 22:21:52 rice is not money.. please read up on the definition of money. Trading a goat for a chicken is not using money. :) its a trade of commodities
96 2018-02-13 22:18:35 I remember my mother and grandmother talking about how horrible commodities really were. Sometimes it would be edible, other times they'd get flour that was full of weevils and once you brought it into the house, they would get into everything, destroying all the food. Ewww.
97 2018-02-13 22:17:38 Actually Marina, let me give you some insight on the new program. It really isn't new, it's and old consent that works and cuts down on a lot of abuse. Research the commodities program. It has assisted & benefited the poor for decades!
98 2018-02-13 22:16:03 Back in 1950s a family would sell us the “commodities” we called them back then when they didn’t use them all. I really liked the meat that came in a can, it was great. I thought it was a big mistake when they went to giving stamps. Too much corruption with stamps for cash.
99 2018-02-13 22:12:54 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
100 2018-02-13 22:10:40 This is NOT what is in Commodity Food boxes! It is second & third grade foodstuffs,canned, dry & buggy. I wish someone on commodities would take a picture of their"monthly"box of food so ppl could see.Better yet, have the Govmnt take a picture of it, show us!
101 2018-02-13 22:10:33 It's surplus USDA commodities that you can get at your local food bank any day of the week. This is quite possibly the most sadistic, heartless, cruel administration the #USA has ever been burdoned with. I am more pissed each day
102 2018-02-13 22:10:30 Of course the libs will have a hussy fit over this... It used to be called commodities. They gave them away on Indian reservations awhile back.
103 2018-02-13 22:09:47 That’s how it used to be years ago ...  in CA it was known as the Commodities Program.  It was cancelled because “dignity”.
104 2018-02-13 22:09:42 We discover, moreover, that the most advantageous use of all commodities would be, for each of them, to go, first, for satisfying those needs which are the most pressing: that, in other words, the so-called “value in use” of a commodity does not depend on a simple whim, as has of
105 2018-02-13 22:04:07 @trish_regan just saw your piece and discussion on food stamps.  Giving food to people is not new.  When I was a child we got what they called commodities they were stables.  Like oatmeal, flour, butter, cheese, dried milk etc.  You actually had to turn it into food. @TeamCavuto
106 2018-02-13 22:03:08 infinite qualia pray above mystical commodities,
 #poetry #poetry
107 2018-02-13 21:59:36 Government Commodities for all
108 2018-02-13 21:59:17 Us older folks called them commodities.
The block cheese in those days was much tastier than the cheese given out today. We also got big cans of a spam-like meat and shredded roast beef. My neighbor would sell hers for fifty cents a can.
109 2018-02-13 21:52:21 Making America great again, going back to surplus commodities instead of SNAP. I took bus with my mom to pick up during period she was laid off in 1950’s. Humiliating and powdered eggs were nasty!! #SNAP
110 2018-02-13 21:51:53 Commodities. Supply local pantries with commodities & make people use the pantry. Disabled & seniors can use the grocery store.
111 2018-02-13 21:48:46 We used to get the government commodities as well. I remember taking butter and sugar sandwiches to school. I don’t begrudge anybody food stamps.
112 2018-02-13 21:46:44 Gaaaaad we had those when I was a kid...commodities...I grew up poor...
113 2018-02-13 21:46:12 I've often said we need to back to commodities and knock this fraud out.
114 2018-02-13 21:45:12 Like commodities food? Dont we have that already? 
What about people with food allergies? 
Thought "canned" food was "unhealthy." Too much preservatives. 
A stupid plan.
115 2018-02-13 21:43:51 Back in the day people got gov commodities, canned meat, powered eggs, powered milk and canned margarine. They had to make the effort to pick it up.  Wasn’t delivered. Nothing wrong with that.
116 2018-02-13 21:42:25 Jr High bestie told me that because her dad was a drunk & wouldn't let her mom work, she & 5 siblings had 2 free meals at (middle class public) school weekdays + corn flakes & govt cheese on weekends. Her 1st job out of school was w/the USDA commodities program to pay it forward
117 2018-02-13 21:41:32 Then you should know they are not made out of paper and you cannot barter them. Most people on food assistance are good people just trying to get by. "Blue Apron - style ( gourmet food) was used as an example, but it wont be like that, it will be bargain basement commodities.
118 2018-02-13 21:41:25 Native Americans still receive commodities
119 2018-02-13 21:39:00 Opinions are one of the cheapest commodities on earth be-careful not to invest too much emotions in them if any...
120 2018-02-13 21:38:52 See: reservations and commodities.
121 2018-02-13 21:37:51 Did you know that native Americans on reservations still get commodities from the gov't? Sometimes the food is moldy or expired when they receive it.
122 2018-02-13 21:36:58 Thats the thing we keep trying to tell you. Most people don't abuse the system. Sending people boxes of carbohydrates, canned fruits and vegetables to save a buck is not the answer. This has actually been tried before. They were called Govt Commodities.  Wonder why it went away?
123 2018-02-13 21:36:29 Natives everywhere are LOLing. These are Commodities (Commods)
124 2018-02-13 21:35:29 The next step is standing on the back of a truck and throwing the boxes to the poor —— lm older and I remember commodities for the poor as a child. You receive whatever company’s have as excess at the end of the month.

 #poetry #math
126 2018-02-13 21:34:42 and it wouldn't be real food. like branded things with normal ingredients. it'd be the commodities crap they already hand out.
127 2018-02-13 21:32:10 This #BlueApronBox thing isn't new. In the 1960's my dad's church was a distro center for government commodities. Oil, flour, rice, coffee, powdered milk *shelf-stable* & the famous "government cheese" along with tins of corned beef. People lined up with boxes/bags 2 pick-up
128 2018-02-13 21:31:23 We hand out commodities now through harvesters. That is boxes full of food. A truck delivers them and senior volunteers unload them and pack up boxes full of food. Storage is a problem so boxes in mass would have to come from grocery stores. 1/2
129 2018-02-13 21:30:17 I got food stamps when my kid was little and my deadbeat husband wouldn’t work “outside his field”. Later on I worked as USDA Commodity coordinator for a Food Bank.  Commodities were available through food pantries then. Are they still?
130 2018-02-13 21:29:38 They were called "commodities," and for some reason, I recall standing with mom at the back of a big semi trailer truck for our turn to get some peanut butter.
131 2018-02-13 21:28:31 He does not even take the risks of the voyage, for his tea and his vessel are insured, and if he has expended four thousand pounds he will receive more than five thousand; that is to say, if he has not attempted to speculate in some novel commodities, in which case he runs a chan
132 2018-02-13 21:28:19 Some GOP nitwit tried to compare this travesty to Blue Apron. Seriously? This is nothing more than commodities. Farmers, grocers, & states/counties will lose $$$$.
133 2018-02-13 21:25:37 When I was a kid, we called it "commodities".
134 2018-02-13 21:24:39 The resources field isn't fast-paced. I'll give you that.
But with news to follow on 3-4 commodities in 4-5 countries, 2 large drill programmes this year and the very real chance of asset monetisation, it's a brave investor to ignore #IRR in 2018.
135 2018-02-13 21:24:25 Isn't this what commodities is now?
136 2018-02-13 21:24:07  On an Indian Reservation in CA there was a commodities distribution each week. They received butter, cheese, rice, beans, powdered milk, canned stuff. Low quality. Like you would get at the $ store. I guess that stuff is alright but it’s surplus somehow. Not fresh.
137 2018-02-13 21:22:33 Krugman dice que bitcoin “tiene un valor puramente especulativo”. Disculpa pero ¿No fue así también con real estate en el 2008 en USA? ¿Y qué me dices de los commodities, como el petróleo, que se desplomó hace tres años? ¿Y los que importaban de USA por el valor del dólar?
138 2018-02-13 21:21:27 Commodities, where have I heard that one before?
139 2018-02-13 21:20:06 It's just the return of commodities with a profit angle somewhere for a tRumper. #TheResistance #Resist
140 2018-02-13 21:19:23 Allow me to rank internet intellectual commodities from worst to best

1) Articles
2) Takes
3) Hipinions
4) regular Opinions
141 2018-02-13 21:18:19 When I was a kid these were called commodities and were passed out to the elderly and poor once a month. Not enough to live on.
142 2018-02-13 21:15:36 Entonces que el barbero invierta en acciones, commodities o real estate que las ganancias son a la fija... o que invierta en comprar dólares que también es ganancia fija. Ahhhh cierto...
143 2018-02-13 21:15:05 The government is trying to bring back commodities

 #poetry #math
145 2018-02-13 21:13:39 you mean 'commodities'? :/
146 2018-02-13 21:11:47 Former commodities trader complains about 'The Establishment' 
147 2018-02-13 21:08:45 2. Devaluation of naira which has led to increase in commodities nationwide.  Don't be deluded of all the happenings going on in Nigeria.
148 2018-02-13 21:08:26 Isn’t this just commodities and gov’t cheese all over again?
149 2018-02-13 21:07:42 In the late 50's: 9 kids & Dad only breadwinner. Was laid off often. Went to county trustee to get "commodities." Cheese, dry milk, canned meat, (nasty) oatmeal. There were times I just craved an apple. Donnie wants us to go back to the '50's.
150 2018-02-13 21:07:00 Since the peak of the commodities boom in 2011-12 profit margins have risen to levels not seen since the early 2000s but wages growth has been slower than at any time since the 1960s. More profits = higher wages? Doesn't look like it #auspol
151 2018-02-13 21:06:10 I remember when the gov did that 50 years ago. If you went to a friend's house and saw 'gov commodities' in their kitchen cabinet, it was an embarrassment in which the shame promoted self-reliance.
152 2018-02-13 21:01:16 Maybe folks are wishing up to this BS system that overpays coaches, ADs, etc. who don't give a damn abt kids & treats them like replaceable commodities.
153 2018-02-13 21:00:21 Like the commodities for Native Americans.
154 2018-02-13 21:00:00 Commodities. That's what they used to call staples delivered thru programs (cheese, flour, rice, beans, powdered milk).  However, an Administration that failed miserably in Puerto Rico is incapable of providing even #MulvaneyMush state-wide.
155 2018-02-13 20:55:28 Woke  up to several articles about this--one which even compared this "new"  idea to Blue Apron. Ummm no. It's neither a new idea nor is it anything  like Blue Apron. This is the commodities program that many Natives over  the age of 30 can tell you all about.
156 2018-02-13 20:53:40 you CAN live on blocks of #GovtCheese, you just shouldn't.

& i volunteer in our food shelf - we are STILL giving that out , in boxes, with peanut butter, cereal, oatmeal, skillet meals , cans of stuff - shelf stable commodities 
157 2018-02-13 20:52:47 It's called commodities just like back in the old days when I remember going with my very poor grandmother to get cheese, Peanut Butter, beans, powdered Milk. Call it what it is....
158 2018-02-13 20:52:24 About time.  Gov't used to hand out Commodities. Hence Gov't cheese.  These people could get healthy food and would not waste it on junk.  Plus farmers and American Taxpayers would benefit.
159 2018-02-13 20:51:49 #Cocoa spits blood. #commodities
160 2018-02-13 20:48:17 When I was young we received commodities. No such thing as ebt or stamps to trade for cash drugs or anything else. Worked fine.
161 2018-02-13 20:44:19 The money is not a lot there... I got a job offer 20 months ago... did the numbers. It didn’t make sense given watch they pay for milk and meat... things I considered basic commodities
162 2018-02-13 20:41:52 When I was a very young kid we very poor and received government commodities. Cheese, powered milk, butter and flour "They didn’t try to make it an attractive program for people to participate in," Of  4 children all were successful hard working tax paying adults!
163 2018-02-13 20:39:58 When I was a very young kid we very poor and received government commodities. Cheese, powered milk, butter and flour "They didn’t try to make it an attractive program for people to participate in," Of  4 children all were successful hard working tax paying adults!
164 2018-02-13 20:37:03 Peoples lives are not commodities. Remains a ridiculous comment.
165 2018-02-13 20:35:49 Terrible. Forgot to add the Hardy's. Sadly the Broken Hardy's were the biggest commodities in Pro wrestling and the only thing Impact got right since Main Event Mafia
166 2018-02-13 20:33:38 you do realize that a lot of the military get food stamps right . Also a lot of the elderly.  old enough to remember what Commodities look like. you talk about an unhealthy batch of food. No fresh fruits no vegetables. Nothing but starch & fat. Yes there are some that abused it
167 2018-02-13 20:33:36 Lowest bidder, buy in bulk. They used to do this every month on the indian reservation before the casinos. Gov’t commodities, black and white label canned food, and a block of cheese. So their new and innovated idea is bullshit it’s been done before
168 2018-02-13 20:32:19 Mom’s family used to live on “commodities” when she was kid. Which is exactly what these bastards are talking about returning to. I was enraged when I saw this today because all I could think of was “What if this were my kid?”. This is not a viable option.
169 2018-02-13 20:31:26 They used to do that years ago!!! Commodities is what they were called.  Cheese, rice, beans etc... what no more Big Macs??  They may have to cook?? No more convenience store rackets??  No more selling them 1/2 price so the money can be spent on drugs? I LOVE THIS!!
170 2018-02-13 20:30:36 OK.  But we want REAL FOOD in those boxes. Not like FEMA gave to hurricane  victims.  The USDA wants to redesign food benefits by delivering a package of U.S.-grown commodities — dubbed “America’s Harvest Box” — to recipients, using the government’s buying power to lower costs.
171 2018-02-13 20:29:12 Growing up in SoCal there was a program called Commodities. There was no food stamps at this time. My Mom hated this program because of the way people were treated. When she came home from getting these Commodities she always looked defeated, disrespected, and just sad.
172 2018-02-13 20:29:09 Reminds me of government commodities we used to get on the Indian reservation. It will be nothing like blue apron. Canned meat is nasty, none of that crap is healthy, everything canned is high in sodium and preservatives.
173 2018-02-13 20:26:42 Probably some don't remember government commodities. That's what we had to use in a group children's home. Canned meat and all the fixens!
174 2018-02-13 20:24:02 If it's anything like the commodities that are handed out once a month at my community center. Nothing goes with anything to make complete meals or a balanced diet.
175 2018-02-13 20:23:39 You do not remember commodities in WV many years ago. It worked. People received food and ate it. There wasn’t the fraud you have now. However now @wvgazettemail is of the mind set that a socialist society is the way things should be.
176 2018-02-13 20:23:34 I believe they used to call them commodities. Not positive but they gave food , milk & cheese not the debit cards or what ever they get now! Seems like it would make someone want 2 get a job more if they got food instead of money! + the Gov could pay farmers to grow it directly!
177 2018-02-13 20:22:22 The Nigerian commodities Exchange needs to be repositioned. They have no clue of the market dynamics in the commodities market especially for export commodities & so can't intervene strategically. Ethiopia Commodities Exchange is a fine example to look at @AuduOgbeh @ProfOsinbajo
178 2018-02-13 20:21:16 He was a commodities trader, wasn't he?  Metals?
179 2018-02-13 20:21:05 This is how it was when we were kids. The "commodities" were picked up monthly. Much more cost effective as bulk buying saves $$$.
180 2018-02-13 20:17:02 Sounds to me he wants to go back to the days of Government Commodities, not health reason they switched to Food Stamps.
181 2018-02-13 20:16:37 School food is an embarrassment even in the wealthiest districts - they buy commodities that aren't even sold in stores, low grade, and feed it to poor kids...
182 2018-02-13 20:15:22 Blue Apron -style, my ass. This travesty of a Trump admin "idea" by 1%'ers to change SNAP is a commodities program meets food pantry (sans fresh fruit & veggies) mash-up, only worse.  F'n canned meat, starchy crap, etc. + aims to treat the working poor even more horribly than b4.
183 2018-02-13 20:13:12 I'm old enough to recall the "commodities" days....neighbors would swap it to us for various things and it was the best cheese ever!
184 2018-02-13 20:12:04 Back to the past again! Food commodities in America...government cheese, powdered milk, beans, canned meat.
185 2018-02-13 20:11:25 There bring back commodities...
186 2018-02-13 20:08:56 America's Harvest is the company that provides commodities....basically it's stuff they can't sell in the grocery store or is almost outdated.
187 2018-02-13 20:08:14 So... Commodities. Their plan to help poor people is the thing they already have to help poor people.
188 2018-02-13 20:07:21 Or a peanut allergy. We have all 3 in our family & had 2 sets of grandparents on commodities.
189 2018-02-13 20:06:45 Haaaa;) I'm not. I am 1/2 Nat American & my parents went thru a tough time in the 80's. So they were given some commodities from family in OK. Mom could make anything great but u can't undo the smell when u first open that can meat! The layer of fat & gel looking junk on top..
190 2018-02-13 20:06:29 In other words, old government commodities - stale generic peanut butter, excess old cheese, tons of starchy foods.
191 2018-02-13 20:05:58 Delivery would be a dream. When our grandparents got commodities, somebody had to drive them downtown to pick up the box. Rice, cheese, peanut butter, all off brands, none good.
192 2018-02-13 20:03:34 This would be a logistical nightmare if it is going to be delivered Blue Apron style.  People standing in line at a distribution center would be even worse.  I remember getting  Gov Commodities as a child.  We don't need to return to the days of Govt cheese and poor food choices.
193 2018-02-13 20:01:35 Up-marketed commodities with a wholesome sounding name?. Reagan  cheese in a pretty box delivered? Which corporations might get the contracts?
194 2018-02-13 20:01:25 Congress needs to read history of food stamps and why the decision was made to change from commodities delivery to food stamps. #MSNBC #SaveSNAP
195 2018-02-13 20:00:01 What would that do to the commodities /ag markets, Paul? Add in the Mexican plans to trade South, exclude US, I see big problem in near term.
196 2018-02-13 19:57:53 Has CBO scored the proposal to bring back commodities program? I bet the cost would far exceed the amount of so called fraud! No program can be perfect; but this takes us back 60 years! Oh and people with food allergies? Congress needs history lessons! #MSNBC #TheResistance
197 2018-02-13 19:57:13 I’ve lived on commodities and canned meat, rice, pasta, whatever. It gave me insentive to actually get a job and feed my family
198 2018-02-13 19:57:04 everyone.. take a minute to think about the hardships and sufferings women endured throughout history and today. Especially in worlds we cannot see and experience, they, right now, are going through it. women are treated as commodities, following dowry deaths..
199 2018-02-13 19:55:40 Sound like commodities in the 60’s. Hope the don’t get powder eggs, powder milk and fake Spam.  Oh the horrible memories
200 2018-02-13 19:53:54 I think Trump, his family, congress and their families should try it on themselves for 6 months while working full time, paying their own healthcare and making minimum wage. Government commodities like canned tomatoes, noodles and tuna DO NOT feed a family!!!
201 2018-02-13 19:52:05 I was reading and I said to myself this  is just like commodities nothing new
202 2018-02-13 19:50:36 I remember when commodities, not $$, were distributed. I like that better. Have personally participated in delivering food boxes to children & their families over long school breaks. Both the children and their family members were excited and appreciative.
203 2018-02-13 19:49:50 The yaradua that made a major effect of one thing that has n will not happen in  again price of commodities reducing..MKO wld have set a pace if u ask me but they chose to kill him,Funaho Williams was another Hero
204 2018-02-13 19:48:46 I think Trump, his family, congress and their families should try it on themselves for 6 months all while working full time, paying their own healthcare and making minimum wage. Government commodities like canned tomatoes, noodles and tuna DO NOT feed a family!!!
205 2018-02-13 19:47:27 Or they can get a box of USDA-certified commodities and see how they manage. Hope they like starch and "cheese" .
206 2018-02-13 19:46:14 This harkens back to the 60’s and 70’s when the Government issued canned “ commodities “ to the poor...it didn’t work then...
207 2018-02-13 19:45:56 Sorry all. I meant committees not commodities.
208 2018-02-13 19:43:58 You had to know how to cook from scratch. Cheese, peanut butter, powdered milk, tuna fish, flour and oh yeah, the canned chicken was the worst. All commodities that the government bought to shore up prices for the farmers and stored. And food stamps actually helped all farmers.
209 2018-02-13 19:42:57 That's absolutely wonderful. The stock market is great but you also want to diversify your assets and not put all your eggs in one basket. You get your stocks, plus your bonds, real estate, precious metals, commodities, etc.
210 2018-02-13 19:41:20 A single person gets around $195 a month for groceries if that. If he or she splurges on anything, there is no money for necessities later. 
Second harvest and others presently do food commodities boxes once per year person family.... Contents are non perishable.
211 2018-02-13 19:40:53 who sold them, they were not only commodities by which they might enrich themselves, they were enemies. So you see, Africans had even more to gain by selling fellow Africans. And they did so with greed and grizzly efficiency 3)
212 2018-02-13 19:40:14 This is a throwback to #Commodities Program, which became #WIC it comes with new distribution twist that lacks insight ... Oh @IvankaTrump
213 2018-02-13 19:38:32 capturing & selling slaves enriched them, helped them to broaden their own "native imperialism", and rid them of competition for power and resources. They looked at their captives with more antipathy than did the Dutch. To the Dutch they were commodities. To the Africans 2)
214 2018-02-13 19:38:13 Preparations under way for AGM of shareholders #1 in March.  We’ve been quietly working, and have exciting things to update our shareholders on, that support the future of the Comtrax Project! We can’t wait to discuss improving #marketaccess for SE Sask commodities and products.
215 2018-02-13 19:37:35 They are bringing back 'commodities-based' diets.
216 2018-02-13 19:37:28 They're bringing back commodities...
217 2018-02-13 19:35:48 it used to be called "commodities"
218 2018-02-13 19:35:13 Also prices are rising sharply for some assets. Inflation is in financial assets not so much commodities.
219 2018-02-13 19:33:52 Also... Anyone who needs help CAN receive the commodities, it's not specifically for #SNAP recipients.
220 2018-02-13 19:33:38 Fraudsters would love for Trump's plan to come into effect, replacing trackable debit cards with good-as-cash boxes of commodities.
221 2018-02-13 19:33:25 I remember the surplus commodities broke families could get before food stamps.

The blocks of surplus cheese were notorious for causing really bad flatulence.
222 2018-02-13 19:33:10 I remember getting commodities in the 80's....So much dignity.
223 2018-02-13 19:30:43 I want to watch Trump's family sit down at the dinner table & have a true gov't issued canned commodities meal prepared by the hands of his wife-Before he tries to say that it's a good/better option. If he opens a can of "meat" that will be the end of this topic!
224 2018-02-13 19:30:40 Record bond, stock and real estate prices. Inflation has gone into assets - as those bubbles now pop, inflation will move from financial assets into commodities and it will than appear as what most people believe to be inflation. In reality inflation = increasing money supply
225 2018-02-13 19:29:55 I am brokenhearted to hear the announcement about the change in SNAP funds to the commodities box. I used to do work with low income people who received such boxes. The food was generally unhealthy and unsatisfying. (Thread.)

227 2018-02-13 19:27:45 It will probably be like commodities on the reservations. Heavy on carbs with pasta, rice, beans. No, 10 cans of syrup-drenched fruits and boiled to death vegetables, and boiled, deboned, shredded beef, pork, and chicken in broth making it hard not to waste food because of size
228 2018-02-13 19:22:52 And, if the people delivering them actually get them to the people who are supposed to get them. Here where I live at least two counties' commodities programs enrich some influential people and rob the poor.
229 2018-02-13 19:20:20 They are bringing back commodities...
230 2018-02-13 19:18:09 Bring back commodities...
231 2018-02-13 19:16:59 Central banks around the world control all markets and commodities. Even the value of your house, if you own one, has no intrinsic value. Everything depends on the state of the global economy in which huge imbalances are currently being created. Nothing's been 'fixed' since 2008.
232 2018-02-13 19:15:13 OK, your guy is bringing back the commodities / government cheese program
233 2018-02-13 19:14:52 A lot of Americans are about to find out what it's like to get "commodities" on the reservation. Unfortunately, it's the wrong class of Americans.  Not much nutritional comes in a can or with the word processed printed on it.
234 2018-02-13 19:14:39 What really blows my mind is who the fuck figured out what drugs do? Like some caveman ass motherfucker threw some bushes on a fire. At a months worth of precious commodities and decided he should do that more?!?!
235 2018-02-13 19:14:23 The market warming up to the idea of inflation, interest rates, and commodities. And they are all "WORRIED" way too early.
236 2018-02-13 19:12:45 They'll probably call them commodities. What a big step backwards. It's just Mean.
237 2018-02-13 19:12:34 In the 70s my grandmother got her "commodities" delivered once a month. At that time it was heavy on powdered milk and lots of cheese. This probably dovetailed with dairy stockpiling done to price support dairy ind. Just a guess tho.
238 2018-02-13 19:11:32 From my latest review: “…  back in the days when education and actual knowledge about your subject were less scorned commodities than they are today…”
239 2018-02-13 19:11:06 That’s certainly true. We had SNAP and got commodities when I was a kid. Come tell me how my Kix cereal was apparently a gateway drug now that I do have cash to buy groceries. Idiots.
240 2018-02-13 19:09:51 Been reading about this lately... we are all commodities now. Am thinking of leaving Facebook to have more time to write more dystopian fiction (as if we need more dystopia in our current lives...)
241 2018-02-13 19:06:30 like the commodities for the poor in the 60's? .canned meats,powdered eggs,cheese,forget all what else.
242 2018-02-13 19:04:46 This is a ridiculous idea, of course, but I’m old enough to remember getting “commodities,” back before food stamps. That potted meat was pretty good and the bricks of cheese and butter were excellent. Obesity city, for sure.
243 2018-02-13 19:00:34 Remember commodities?
244 2018-02-13 19:00:20 Lifestyle primacy, animals, and now even children are just commodities.

247 2018-02-13 18:57:21 Blue Apron style? Food commodities again in America.
248 2018-02-13 18:56:51 When I was a teenager, my folks got what were called commodities. It was an income based government program, not tied to the food stamp program. Once a month we would wait in line for a box based on our family size. This idea may just work.
249 2018-02-13 18:55:04 My Mom gets these boxes for Senior Commodities.  It has 1% milk in boxes plus a large bag of dry 1% milk. My mom is allergic to milk
250 2018-02-13 18:54:19 But government cheese is delicious Rez, I'm not even joking, I used to love that shit when we would get commodities on the Rez(Reservation)
251 2018-02-13 18:53:57 Murder the poor by making them subsist on government subsidized commodities like corn, dairy, sugar.
252 2018-02-13 18:53:43 Several small communities offer these commodities in addition to the food stamp program. I understand tightening regulations to cut the fat and corruption, but many people who receive food stamps actually need the help. If implemented, we need to step up & help our neighbors
253 2018-02-13 18:53:29 ALL able bodied adults BYE. ALL illegal  BYE.  Giving birth is not a disability - BYE. Back to commodities BYE foodstamps.
254 2018-02-13 18:53:05 Yeah I've always went the commodities route since kid if need came up so if it goes down can offer advice.
255 2018-02-13 18:49:54 $COMB is less than 25% energy, if you want to make a bet on commodities that isn't a proxy for oil. I'm newly long.
256 2018-02-13 18:48:12 If its like commodities can give y'all tips on making bomb biscuits with bakery mix and powder eggs. You'll make hard tack if you go bag directions.
257 2018-02-13 18:45:03 He will make one stop per county and people will have to go get it, in other words people will just be going to a food bank for commodities. He will go to hell.
258 2018-02-13 18:43:39 Commodities were great here when my son was little but a lot of the girls didn't know how to cook from scratch. I handed out recipes I printed up
259 2018-02-13 18:39:18 In the old days of commodities, my family benefited greatly from commodity boxes not allowing for allergies. My kids were not allergic, a friend's were. We didn't qualify, she did. She gave the PB away. That peanut butter was GOOD.
260 2018-02-13 18:37:18 Commodities is what he’s proposing. Power milk, a few cans of vegetables and fruit, pasta with all the starch, and maybe canned juice
261 2018-02-13 18:35:30 Do y’all remember commodities? Was that a New Orleans thing

263 2018-02-13 18:32:07 I don't agree with this proposal for many reasons but will say that when I was a child that commodities were given to poor that had peanut butter, cheese, butter & canned meat like what is now called pressed ham & they were high quality.I wouldn't trust this administration for it
264 2018-02-13 18:30:17 I remember the "government commodities program" that many counties subscribed to before SNAP. It was--hydrogenated peanut butter, fake cheese, & a spamlike canned meat we called "ickle." Bags of white rice and pinto beans (the only good thing in the lot).
265 2018-02-13 18:29:48 The weird thing is that the Foodstamps program was designed to cut the farmers, food products companies and the grocery network into profiting, instead of just giving away the commodities to those who qualified...the type of privatization the GOP usually likes...
266 2018-02-13 18:28:25 Inflation data... we, the working class, can tell you the data and it's not good! Gas the highest in years, butter $5/lb, steak $14/lb
So that tax break was a load of crap as the inflation of commodities has gone up more, much more than it provides.
267 2018-02-13 18:27:06 They only hijacked the name, not the actual product. Trump wants government commodities like dry milk, canned goods, and beans and cereal. They think (guess they're right) that most people will take their word for it without checking further.
268 2018-02-13 18:26:02 It'll most likely be like the old Commodities program, but on a larger scale.
Another big reason for doing it this way is likely to aid the farmers (i.e. Dairy), who'll be hit hard by NAFTA. A bunch of WI & MN dairies have already been affected.
Getting a bunch of the existing...
269 2018-02-13 18:25:12 That’s all they eat anyway. Boxed foods.  Who said it has to be bad foods?? That’s your interpretation. Commodities used to be prime cheese, butter etc. so “we” must mean you are on food stamp program  food is so $$$ today no one can afford to eat healthy so your point is mute
270 2018-02-13 18:22:38 It's 2018, let's stop describing people and their culture as spicy! Let's just stop describing people as food and commodities! Come on!!!!!!!!
271 2018-02-13 18:21:15 This only makes sense under the the premisse that commodities ROI equals companies ROI.
272 2018-02-13 18:21:14 That's what they did years and years ago you stood in line for commodities
273 2018-02-13 18:20:42 We called them "commodities" back in the day. I remember helping my dad unload them off a truck and carrying a few of those heavy of bricks of cheese and those big cans of peanut butter home. It would be all we had sometimes until the first of the month came.
274 2018-02-13 18:19:45 The food stamps program evolved from the commodities program where people got peanut butter and cheese. Problem was States with no agriculture could not provide a balance of food! Who will administer the nationwide food pantries and where will the food come from? #MSNBC
275 2018-02-13 18:16:49 This is not new. Commodities boxes was done in the 1970 through the early 1990.  It was cut out due to the cost.
276 2018-02-13 18:15:05 Cash- for those liquid enough to get it- for the initial decline, PMs / commodities when the Fed reverses course.
277 2018-02-13 18:14:59 #AMERICA is in shambles! I remember when America was so called great, folks were standing in long lines waiting for #foodstamps and #commodities! At least #MacandCheese will be great again #GovernmentCheeseisBack #SMDH
278 2018-02-13 18:13:27 3. Trumps plan wants to take that from me, my Medicare, and my Social Security. Whats left, DEATH? Going back to the days of "government" food? It's a box of crap! I am vegan. I eat veg, fruit, no dairy/meat/eggs. Government commodities, gives you meat in a can, milk in a box,
279 2018-02-13 18:12:39 As part Amerindian in ok we received “commodities” from the BIA instead of the royalties from them outsourcing our land to Farmland Coop. Canned meat, canned butter, canned milk, flour. Shit on a shingle blue apron. Commodities.
280 2018-02-13 18:09:22 County decided we qualified for food commodities. We got a box of food (Army surplus) that held rolled oats, a block of cheese, bags of dried peas & beans, Spam-like meat, tins of chipped beef, powdered milk & eggs. We were lucky my grandmother had been a professional cook. 2/
281 2018-02-13 18:05:50 The commodities we used to pick up on the rez consisted of real food, canned salmon, cheese, wheat and corn flour, honey, organic peanut butter you had to stir. I suspect under trump it will all be high fructose corn syrup and cheese whiz
282 2018-02-13 18:05:47 Listen,  I don't care about your color,  your sex, who you have sex with, who you pray to, or who you vote for. Until we can see each other as people and not commodities nothing will ever get better for any of us
283 2018-02-13 18:05:10 My parents were on aid for a bit when I was a child back then it was called commodities and was a box of the basics peanut butter powdered milk and such. 1950’s idea.
284 2018-02-13 18:04:48 This sounds like #commodities given by our government to people whose long existing food, (clothing, etc)bison, was destroyed by yep, our government. Degrading to recipients and extra bureaucracy proposed by the party that claims to despise it.
285 2018-02-13 18:04:22 Commodities are coming back......
286 2018-02-13 18:03:35 This is exactly how commodities used to work. (Yes, I remember the govt. cheese and peanut-butter). The two problems with getting actual food boxes is the added logistics of packaging the products PLUS having to customize the food to fit the dietary needs of each recipient.
287 2018-02-13 18:02:15 O/N Wrap:
Global equities and the USD slip, though relative to recent moves, the fall was marginal; hard commodities improving, but oil back under the pump; UK CPI holds at 3.0%; NZD touches briefly above 0.7300; nerves increasing ahead of US CPI tonight.
288 2018-02-13 18:02:01 It was once called commodities. I.e., government cheese, rice, flour, powdered milk, beans, cornmeal, spam, etc. Good for @POTUS 
289 2018-02-13 18:00:02 Commodities: Rubber +4.61%, Natural gas +2.55%
290 2018-02-13 17:58:09 We called 'em "commodities" when my family received that stuff in the late '60s and early '70s. Helped a lot. But embarrassed the heck out of me when we had to go pick them up. We were fortunate to have a kitchen with a stove. But it was still tough for our family.
291 2018-02-13 17:57:48 This is not an innovative idea.  It's an OLD idea. USDA commodities.  Stuff taxpayers bought from corporate farms via farm subsidies.  I got these boxes in the 70's. Oh, and let's have the USPS deliver them FOR FREE. That'll work...
292 2018-02-13 17:57:20 This Blue apron crap sounds like in the fifties and sixties and poor people were handed out governmment  Commodities. Embarrassing as hell but the cheese was great.
293 2018-02-13 17:57:07 That's great, but I wasn't talking about a food pantry. I'm talking about the proposed commodities program in Trump's budget.
294 2018-02-13 17:55:07 This reminded me of commodities that were handed out to Natives.  Augh.
295 2018-02-13 17:54:34 Lula não fez nada seu imbecil, Brasil é grande exportador de commodities caso vc n saiba e a China evoluindo muito comprou bastante do Brasil, a economia aumentou e gerou mais empregos, Lula fez foi merda nenhuma, era p termos evoluído muito mais naquela época, vc fuma merda?
296 2018-02-13 17:52:54 It’s a commodities program. Pure and simple. But how are they going to distribute commodities to the inner cities? No fresh anything? No cheese? What people need in the inner cities is access to fresh foods. Vegetables, fruits. This admin cares nothing for people.
297 2018-02-13 17:50:49 sounds like the distribution of non perishable "commodities" that preceded the food stamp program. More retro "reform."
298 2018-02-13 17:50:47 Remember commodities?  Spam, peanut butter, cheese, dried beans, powdered milk etc. Next up gas ration coupons.
299 2018-02-13 17:50:20 99.9% of Wiley's paintings hang in rich white people's homes and are gazed upon as part of a collection of commodities.

 #poetry #mathematics
301 2018-02-13 17:48:07 Didn't they call it commodities?
302 2018-02-13 17:47:21 Nothing wrong with powder eggs and milk.. or canned meats
I remember these "commodities"as they were called back in the early 80's
maybe it's time we stop giving walmart all that sweet foodstamp cash they pad their bottom line with.
303 2018-02-13 17:47:19 Dear, no.  Dry beans, cereals, powdered milk, canned meats, canned fruits and vegetables, peanut butter, cornmeal and flour is NOT Blue Apron.  It's agricultural commodities. Leftover stuff the Gov't bought.  Got them in the 70's. We can do better.
304 2018-02-13 17:47:06 It's simply the old Food Commodities program that pre-dated Food Stamps.
305 2018-02-13 17:47:00 @realDonaldTrump tax cut breaks the bank so food stamps will give out commodities from his friends/vendors.
306 2018-02-13 17:46:38 Invoke the Necessary Provisions of The Essential Commodities Act, 1955 mandated MS HSD (Regulation of Supply, Distribution and Prevention of Malpractices) Order, 2005 besides the IPC Provisions as Applicable! We Stand for Fairness and Rule of Law. Period. @drramansingh
307 2018-02-13 17:45:53 Because commodities worked well in the native communities
308 2018-02-13 17:44:09 Believe its not the country, more the international market for various commodities, and probably USD benefits from status of being a reserve currency.
Was surprised to find market for milk traded in dollars.
If you travel anywhere always good to have a stash of USD
309 2018-02-13 17:40:50 Please stop calling Trump's abhorrent SNAP cut and commodities box a "Blue Apron style" plan.  Blue Apron sends fresh meat, vegetables, and perishable groceries in a refrigerated box.  This is NOT going to be like Blue Apron.
310 2018-02-13 17:39:56 First thing I thought of was commodities
311 2018-02-13 17:38:59 More women in the Fortune 500 is maybe sustainable in capitalism because reproduction in their households could be mediated entirely through commodities not aapropriation of unwaged labour.
312 2018-02-13 17:37:48 @DocThompsonShow 

Oh boy

Someone saw call for #PetSNAP and countered it with a Blue Apron spin

Once upon a time, low-income households DID wait in lines to take home a box of govt commodities

It would cut down on food stamp fraud
313 2018-02-13 17:37:03 This is going to be exactly like the commodities Native Americans received- big blocks of velveeta-like cheese, rice and canned milk.
314 2018-02-13 17:36:30 This is Trump trying to sell something. The problem is human lives are not commodities.
315 2018-02-13 17:35:40 "Blue Apron style" my ass. It's commodities. I grew up on that crap cuz we were dirt poor. Sure, you get rice, beans and peanut butter. "Cheese", (read as wax), and canned "pork", (read as leftover pig bits).
316 2018-02-13 17:32:25 You weren't but you made me think & making a joke out of a kid not understanding something that basic was in bad taste. They seem to be good kids but their father seems to treat them more like commodities than his sons.
317 2018-02-13 17:31:41 I remember those too. You are right it would be another hit on the economy and a boon to crony friends that get the billions of dollars in contracts for crappy commodities
318 2018-02-13 17:30:36 This article is good except it uses the word "Money" interchangeably with "Currency". My point is there is a difference. Money is a debt-based currency. Commodities can be used as currencies. Bitcoin is neither debt-based or a commodity but can still be a currency.
319 2018-02-13 17:28:25 Taking away the ability to buy fresh healthy foods & supplementing w/ government cheese is only going 2 raise healthcare costs. I know-I grew up on “commodities”. I challenge you to live on such a diet for a month @realDonaldTrump #WithABuckFiftyAWeek #SNAP #blueapronitisnot
320 2018-02-13 17:27:41 Those of us old enough to remember the shitty commodities box under Reagan remember the shitty commodities it contained.  Oily glops of no-name peanut butter for everyone.  SNAP was an improvement on that.
321 2018-02-13 17:27:08 The commodities approach again?
322 2018-02-13 17:26:42 That's wonderful. You know this commodities program isn't offering fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables, right? Just canned. But more importantly, do the people whose refrigerators you "make over" invite you to do so?
323 2018-02-13 17:26:42 Voluntary interaction =/= market. There's no market in sacral norms. No one is buying and selling sacral norms like commodities, nor do sacral norms have any prices associated with them. Therein lies the problem: The propagation of sacral norms isn't governed by market-mechanisms
324 2018-02-13 17:26:01 Is t that just taking us back to the “Good ole days” of government commodities
325 2018-02-13 17:25:33 Bananacoin trying to swagger jack my #shrimpcoin and #maizecoin ideas. Digital commodities are the next big thing.
326 2018-02-13 17:20:45 You’re delusional
This is Sec/Ag. Sonny Perdue’s plan
Perdue runs a company that trades agricultural commodities
The 1% profits bigly again
327 2018-02-13 17:17:52 Government did this in the past, 50s/60s, it's where all the government cheese jokes came from. My grandparents used to get 'commodities' once a month. Giant block of cheese, powdered eggs, powdered milk, spam like meat,Bologna,boxes of Mac and cheese.Who's been in the old files?
328 2018-02-13 17:16:55 Because artificially inflating the minimum wage is only going to harm small businesses, replace jobs with automation faster, and drive the price of commodities up
329 2018-02-13 17:16:52 Right. And there actually still is a commodities program for people older than 60. Mostly it does not deliver to people's homes.
330 2018-02-13 17:16:37 En conclusión: ¿Es bitcoin una buena opción para invertir? Sí, solo si aprendes del tema y te capacitas y ENTIENDES que como toda inversión, tiene su margen de riesgo (como invertir en divisas, en acciones o commodities).
331 2018-02-13 17:14:51 You used to have to go pick them up and they would be called commodities... You get powdered milk, peanut butter, cheese, pasta, cereal...

333 2018-02-13 17:10:40 33.  Actually, there are "commodities" programs in rural towns all over the Midwest.  I grew up eating government pork out of a can with a little mustard.  It was actually pretty good.

336 2018-02-13 17:06:33 When I was a kid the government used to hand out 'commodities' for low income people. It's where all the jokes about government cheese come from. Giant blocks of cheese, powdered eggs, bologna, powdered milk. So someone in trump admin must have dug thru an old file found this.
337 2018-02-13 17:00:54 That would be called commodities...
338 2018-02-13 16:58:29 MRE,s..? They used to have "commodities" canned meat (spam) velveeta like cheese, powdered eggs,various canned veggies....ya had to line up every month to get them...soul crushing
339 2018-02-13 16:56:57 Great idea, do away with snap cards altogether as a supplement and use only commodities. See how well that swaps for drugs.
340 2018-02-13 16:55:56 Commodities are great if you're prepping for the collapse of society. I remember when we'd visit grandma and she's send us back home with a box full of canned goods.

342 2018-02-13 16:54:13 Does he know he is talking about the old Commodities program from the 50s? Does he care? No.
343 2018-02-13 16:52:34 He was educated at Dulwich College (fee-paying independent school), and was a City commodities trader (working at the London Metal Exchange, brokerage firm Drexel Burnham, Crédit Lyonnais Rouse and others). Plus, he has been an MEP since 1999. 

Really anti-establishment, eh?
344 2018-02-13 16:47:42 It was called "commodities"...my GGM got them.

It included canned/dried vegs, fruits, milk, meats, cheese, butter, flours/meals/sugar/salt, shortening, peanut butter, etc....it was sufficient.

It did NOT inc ribeyes & gourmet salad blends...that you'd have bought yourself.
345 2018-02-13 16:47:06 Sounds a lot like what was called "commodities" from the 1960s and 1970s. Ate a lot of cheese from a can back in the day.
346 2018-02-13 16:44:12 We should all send Trump oatmeal, rice, flour, beans, powdered eggs, powdered milk, sugar, cornmeal, processed cheese and canned meat so his staff can fix his meals. He's trying to force commodities back on the poor while he eats at McDonald's and KFC & drinks pop by the gallon
347 2018-02-13 16:43:40 As a child and a Native American the govt issued commodities. My mom, who worked multiple jobs after my father was KIA in Viet Nam, would get them, then stockpile it for others in need. It is just another way to control and humiliate the poor.
348 2018-02-13 16:43:27 As a child and a Native American the govt issued commodities. My mom, who worked multiple jobs after my father was KIA in Viet Nam, would get them, then stockpile it for others in need. It is just another way to control and humiliate the poor.
349 2018-02-13 16:42:05 Now, this also dovetails (or can dovetail) with racism.  In any event, it’s all bad.  It’s government cheese and the commodities program all over again.  BUT...
350 2018-02-13 16:40:43 When I was a young girl, they called these things "the commodities." Bad idea.
351 2018-02-13 16:40:20 A return to commodities would waste money best used for existing programs. No doubt, this dumb idea is a guise to charge the gov for expired foods.

Sonny Perdue runs a company that trades agricultural commodities.
Hmm
354 2018-02-13 16:36:54 Commodities and currencies are the only things behaving more or less 'normally'  LOL
355 2018-02-13 16:35:19 What difference does it make what they call it - a box of food makes far more sense than giving them money.  Money can be converted into all kinds of nefarious commodities- food you either eat it or throw it away.  Good for Mr. Trump!
356 2018-02-13 16:31:01 Maybe, but I loved the "welfare commodities" I got in California in the 1970s. I didn't feel humiliated, but privileged, as did the other hippies that I knew.
357 2018-02-13 16:27:02 The government already has a program like this, it's called commodities! 
358 2018-02-13 16:26:53 I remember as a child when my dad got laid off from the mines we got “surplus” food. Lard, corn meal, some slimy canned meat in gravy, and a few other tasteless commodities delivered in black and white packages. No fruit, or vegetables or the ability to get them. Back to the 50’s
359 2018-02-13 16:26:37 Does the elimination also include Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR) which provides USDA commodities to low-income households & elderly on reservations? That’s a scary prospect for those households who survive well below poverty levels in remote communities.
360 2018-02-13 16:25:26 The government has been giving the boxes to Native Americans, they are called Commodities. It is one way of keeping cash out of their hands. People seem upset now that white folks might be getting them. Bottom line. If you are poor or POC, the government doesn't care if about u.
361 2018-02-13 16:22:30 In the 80s I was starving and couldn't get government distributed commodities because I was homeless and had to have an address to qualify. It'd be just like that again. And as someone mentioned if you are diabetic it would be hard. Diabetics have to restrict their food.
362 2018-02-13 16:19:47 FWIW, the use of "ask" as a noun has a solid basis in trading--"bid" and "ask" prices--so using it in the context of a negotiation is IMO acceptable, though it seems a bit contrived outside the context of negotiating commodities/equities/debt/etc. pricing.

365 2018-02-13 16:16:20 Blue Apron-style meals aren't that different than the old USDA commodities program. My concerns would be 1) cost, 2) decreased self-determination for already low agency populations, possibly delaying transition out of the welfare state.

368 2018-02-13 16:10:26 Throwback to the 70's when poor families like mine received a "box of commodities" (canned meat, peanut butter, syrup, dried raisins, powdered milk, powdered eggs, etc...)
369 2018-02-13 16:04:07 That is what we used to get "farm commodities". 5 lb of rolled oats, macaroni, flour, 2 lbs cheese (that was actually good), 2 lbs of mystery meat (spam), 1-2 cans of fruit or vegetables.  Not even close to recommended dietary requirements.  What is this inclination towards 1950
370 2018-02-13 16:00:32 Pulls up to get commodities in 60,000 dollar truck. 
371 2018-02-13 15:59:05 Sounds like the old commodities program. The older, cheaper and more effective soup kitchen program, was better. Anyone could get good, healthy food and cost is minimal. School kitchens could provide the meals. Beggars can't be choosers, with deficits it's all we can afford.

374 2018-02-13 15:55:42 Disgraceful!  Back to the 1920's where the poor lived off of commodities!  Very unhealthy...increases health problems!
375 2018-02-13 15:51:56 This was RT sans article, & I cannot find it.
This is important- seniors are on Food Share ...this would be a disaster. Does anyone know what gov commodities are?
Some of it is very unhealthy.
Seniors often isolate, marketing is semi-social
376 2018-02-13 15:50:42 They won't be even close to blue apron styled! They will be nasty substandard Gov commodities. Powered Milk, bad cereals, unmarked canned goods, barely edible  America can afford to take care of it's neediest citizens better than that.  It's Proof just how much GOP hate the poor
377 2018-02-13 15:47:44 Remember when was very young in Oklahoma something about this. Know American Indians got Commodities?? It was a food program. Not sure it’s a memory.
378 2018-02-13 15:42:45 No fresh food canned gross commodities. Leave it stand - people have special diets, allergies, need access to whole foods (helps farmers) etc
379 2018-02-13 15:42:24 True, but QE is a global issue and natural target for outflows, fixed income, would then stem cause of outflows. Inflation eliminates cash option. Left with commodities and cryptos, never thought I would find myself justifying higher values for the latter
380 2018-02-13 15:40:07 It must have changed is all I can say, because people used cheat like hell around here, to get the commodities! Because of the quality!
381 2018-02-13 15:39:37 I trade futures (commodities) - everything.. Haven't been posting those much. Focus on metals and $CL_F.
382 2018-02-13 15:38:57 This isn’t new. Before food stamps we had commodities. Now you get a credit card and can buy colas and potato chips. The capitalist didn’t like it because they didn’t make money off our tax dollars. My grandma got commodities and got along just fine. Depends on how much you get.
383 2018-02-13 15:37:37 Do you trade commodities?
384 2018-02-13 15:35:03 While Congo accounts for 54 per cent of global cobalt production, 94 per cent of cobalt procured by Chinese enterprises comes from Congo, according to statistics from Britain’s metal supplier Darton Commodities.
385 2018-02-13 15:34:45 As it is, they get boxes of "commodities."  Chopped fig pieces, dried cranberries, cranberry juice concentrate, chopped walnuts.....
386 2018-02-13 15:33:10 Have you ever seen what's in a box of commodities that is given to our First People on reservations? Not good. Not healthy. The labels even say, "for reservations only". People wonder where they came up with this idea?
387 2018-02-13 15:31:57 This would be a step backward to the days of government commodities: salty, bland, bulk food. I remember humongous bags of puffed rice with lice crawling over it. Creamed chipped beef on toast, anyone?

403 2018-02-13 15:00:49 A person on food stamps told me “No money is No Money.” Nothing to stretch, economize with, or cover fresh food. 
Would these boxes be USDA commodities? — cheese, flour, butter, dry milk, rice… these only work if 1) you can cook and have a stove, 2) have $ to cover other basics.
404 2018-02-13 14:58:33 The reason we went from commodities (government cheese...though in rural areas some still get commodities) to being able to use #SNAP at the grocery store was because the large grocery chains and farming concerns lost money.

406 2018-02-13 14:57:17 Ahí tenes el problema. El agro produce trabajo por fuera de su sector porque incentiva al crecimiento económico de toda la economía. Por ejemplo en servicios o turismo. Esto se lo presenciamos en el período 2003-2007 cuando las commodities nos hicieron crecer a todos los sectores

408 2018-02-13 14:53:43 Being native, most natives will be honest and say that being on commodities can be helpful but as for healthy. ...that's another story. I have seen families sell commodity foods just so they can buy fresh vegetables, fruits and meat that's not in a can. #nativetruths
409 2018-02-13 14:52:30 Have you ruled out a rise in the price of commodities causing a spike in "inflation?"
410 2018-02-13 14:48:26 Probably like commodities. My elderly mother gets a box each month. It has a brick of cheese, canned veggies, two bottles of juice, two shelf stable milk, a bag of rice or dry beans, a can of meat, a box of pasta, canned mixed fruit & applesauce. Plant a garden, people.

412 2018-02-13 14:45:19 Ecn101: Economics is the study of how societies use scarce resources to produce valuable commodities and distribute them among different people.

413 2018-02-13 14:43:54 US spends about $235 million in public funds to promote all agricultural commodities internationally. The EU spends $300 million alone to promote wine.

420 2018-02-13 14:20:24 But because it’s cheapest, all commodities and TEFAP provide are carbs.  For folks who already suffer in food deserts, it’s a recipe for heart disease, diabetes, etc. Incredibly frustrating.
421 2018-02-13 14:19:04 I help run TEFAP at my church (& we have sr commodities too). If people don’t also get SNAP, WIC, or something else, it’s a recipe for all carbs, all the time. And our clients repeatedly beg for more variety, more fresh fruits & veg, more meat.
422 2018-02-13 14:16:37 They already have a few versions of this: senior commodities, where folks on SS get a box of canned goods & a brick of cheese, & TEFAP, where folks get USDA commodities. But both programs have major issues (hardly enough food for one, nutrition is awful.)

469 2018-02-13 11:25:21 That reply made my day. You were comparing gold with commodities before it, not a currency pegged to it.
470 2018-02-13 11:11:06 US CPI data out Wednesday night could provide some real trades.

A higher print will lead to lower bond prices driving yields and the USD higher. Commodities and gold would take a hit.

478 2018-02-13 10:53:10 I'm increasingly thinking that the push to drop all tariffs in the 19th century was way ahead of its time. The only time tariffs should be considered is for anti-dumping reasons. For basic commodities and especially food, its immoral to impose tariffs. It's regressive.

481 2018-02-13 10:36:26 In a statement provided to The Hill, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue defended the "bold, innovative approach" to feeding the nation's hungry.

No sir, not new.  It was called "commodities" in the 70's.  I got the boxes.

487 2018-02-13 10:14:32 My mom volunteers at a food pantry that gets USDA commodities. Some of it is great. Some of it they can’t get rid of. Example. Apparently the canned beef stew is good but people don’t want it in the summer. Who would?
488 2018-02-13 10:13:47 Farmers expect higher procurement prices for their farm commodities  which they find in the C2 measurement method of cost of cultivation  since it includes FIXED costs (including imputed rental value of owned land) C2 cost which is a comprehensive cost of production calculated

492 2018-02-13 09:28:16 Without external wage growth drivers (namely, for Aus economy, higher commodity prices) IRs are only option, particularly given Aus govt deficits (to prop up aggregate demand) should deny tax cuts.

519 2018-02-13 06:59:46 This sounds like the Commodities Program that our grandparents used way back. They got rice, cheese, butter, flour, & peanut butter. If that's what Mulvaney calls Blue Apron, let him eat it. Especially if he has Celiac or a nut allergy.
520 2018-02-13 06:55:43 Oh my god.  A return to the “Commodities “ program of the 60’s!  It made no sense then and it won’t now. This really making America great again!

527 2018-02-13 06:10:33 Years ago the gov had a commodities giveaway. Peanut butter, milk, cheese, if I remember rightly. Had to do with emptying out a strategic reserve, left over from something. It was monthly or bi-monthly and lasted for years.

549 2018-02-13 04:34:16 Sort of like commodities that were handed out before Food Stamps.
550 2018-02-13 04:28:47 Reminds me of before food stamps when all the feds gave out was commodities. The huge boxes of American cheese and Spam like meat in cans, along with dry milk. It kept you from starving but also caused a lot of diabetes and obesity and thus, higher medical bills.

552 2018-02-13 04:24:58 They did this sixty years ago. It was called the "commodities" program. We used to get commodities from the government when my dad was on strike. Powdered milk and corneal, cans of " mystery meat." It was offal. No, I didn't spell that wrong.
553 2018-02-13 04:15:54 Used to only cost me P1,200 for a full tank of gas, now I average between P1,600 to P1,800 in the same car. THAT is a difference one can feel. I can only imagine the struggles of someone paying for basic commodities these days with an even smaller paycheck.

556 2018-02-13 04:13:40 The reason food commodities evolved through food stamps to EBT cards was due to grocery store outcry. Grocery stores felt that the food commodities were cutting into their profit line. Let's see how it works this time !

573 2018-02-13 03:02:28 Federal program if I recall correctly but with local distribution. If a woman was pregnant, even if not poor, she could get certain items we were told but we never went to collect. We knew a family that got the commodities, they even gave us a big hunk of cheddar cheese.

576 2018-02-13 02:53:44 Of course they are. They need numbers to show their base. Status or risk means nothing when we are talking human commodities

583 2018-02-13 02:10:33 I lived in handicapped HUD housing and each month we got "commodities." It was a big deal & often people would knock on the doors of their neighbours to remind them. Rice, cheese, butter, flour - and one time a can labelled PORK (no thanks). 1

592 2018-02-13 01:17:14 Ugh. I grew up on welfare before food stamps. We received commodities. Went to a "special" store - warehouse of sorts - and picked up, among other things, powdered eggs. Everything was in cans or packages that simply had the item name on it. We felt "less than."
593 2018-02-13 01:10:00 This is getting beyond the depletion of emotional intelligence of the president. It’s like women are livestock to him, like slave masters were to their slaves.  They are commodities to him. Women aren’t humans. They only provide goods: sex & legacy carriers (children).
