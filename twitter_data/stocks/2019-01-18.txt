0 2019-01-20 23:59:37 2019 earnings growth will be inflated by tax scam, defense spending, and huge offshore repatriation. Wall St. will pump stocks, take profits, then bail leaving you holding the bag. #Trumpanonics will end with  a BUST  like all #Trump BIZ. BE CAREFUL.
1 2019-01-20 23:57:43 I’m not discounting that he was great, I’m just saying he is overrated. And you can bring up Stocks stats (I’m not even saying Stock was the best PG ever), but that man also has 2 all-time stat titles that no one has come close to breaking and he missed all of 13 games.
2 2019-01-20 23:52:30 All these replies are just nonsense &/or dumb. A majority of ppl approve of the ad, which is why Gillette's stocks went up. You just only associate w/fellow dum dums who share your identical worldview, dummy. It's called an echo chamber
3 2019-01-20 23:52:14 Interest Rates increased slightly last week even though Federal reserve said they are watching economic reports and will adjust their policies as warranted.  Investors celebrated and stocks jumped almost 3% for the week.

8 2019-01-20 23:48:48 If we are in a secular bull market, you'd be crazy to be out of stocks. But I think investors are even crazier to be out in a secular bear. But have a strategy and stick to it. Mine is "do nothing. Have patience. Buy as cheaply as possible."
9 2019-01-20 23:47:50 Listen, for anyone who ever stocks my Twitter, this is a place for me to get my true honest thoughts out without hurting people and for me to vent how I feel. Ima own up to all my shit, you’re not gathering potential tea, you’re gathering truth.
10 2019-01-20 23:47:45 Yes. Maxed out and I chose a 75% stocks and 25% bonds mix.
11 2019-01-20 23:47:38 We haven't gone down the road - yet - of getting extra stocks in of Mum's repeat prescriptions, and she generally isn't right up to the line when they get refilled - but that's a conversation we'll be having very soon.
12 2019-01-20 23:47:06 If you’ve got any stocks you’d like to offload, I’m buying once again
13 2019-01-20 23:46:15 One of the shops n Emganwini coming out on zbc news belongs to a certain old & he had just landed a truck of stocks from SA both shop & store room were looted dry plus his cowdry park shop. I almost cried when I met him. That can't be repeated #Bulawayo
14 2019-01-20 23:46:12 My grandmother started investing in 1972 in stocks. It was a secular bear market. She did nothing but hold for over 40 years. She finally went into cash at age 93 because she was too worried about it. She was fine. The money grew.
15 2019-01-20 23:45:14 Given the shorts in play on Metal Tiger stocks, it could be an Interesting few days/weeks
16 2019-01-20 23:44:37 @NFL if you let the refs who officiated in this game have a job after this season, you stocks will plummet. Forget kneeling or anything like that. Call a fair game and don't leave it up to the black and whites
17 2019-01-20 23:43:47 @nfl your league and it’s officiating are complete laughing stocks. Officials completely stole this game away from NOLA.
18 2019-01-19 23:58:40 why do people play stage hazards, items, two stocks on smash ultimate pubs? What the actual FUCK?
19 2019-01-19 23:58:13 Stocks and expand that 401k baby. Start investing. Make that $$ grow.
20 2019-01-19 23:58:06 A lot of people lately have been telling me that I should make Isabelle my secondary. lol Also just won a 2v1 while I have 2 stocks & the other two had 4. Sakurai is trying to tell me something here...was Isabelle made just for me? #Fate
21 2019-01-19 23:57:54 That's sucks but cool at the same thing. Paying you for two months and giving you your stocks. I gotta wait til Monday or Tuesday to see if they do anything to us in m3 eol.
22 2019-01-19 23:57:46 I already do this and know about the stock investment but if I don't have money to invest in stocks. And for the business, I already had a bad experience in doing business before so what shall I do. Thanks
23 2019-01-19 23:56:37 Yet another money grab from the govt!!!
Like the fisheries after making people pay for fishing licenses and watching fish stocks fail, this new food business license is a money grab that will fail to be useful!!!!!!

27 2019-01-19 23:53:40 Soon, politicians start buying just specific stocks and just for boosting stock price to keep their popularity. That is exactly happening in Japan right now. Who basically is buying Japanese stocks are BOJ, and National Pension fund.... It is not good.
28 2019-01-19 23:52:39 I feel that if you had more control over Zard, you wouldn't really be looking for stray hits and would use his own tools to build damage. I think a lot of PT players just see Zard as a way to clean up stocks over what he can do on his own.

To each their own though
29 2019-01-19 23:52:31 Real business people can't make long term plans with a seeming toddler acting as president. If there is a crash, it's going to be your fault. And I think I would choose a crash if it gets you out of office. Most Americans don't care about stocks they can't afford
30 2019-01-19 23:50:50 You forgot our record lows during the fall?  You open your mouth and stocks crash.  You're BREAKING our great union for personal gain.  You would sell the liberty bell If you could.
31 2019-01-19 23:49:52 Oo bes, madami stocks! Avail kana

33 2019-01-19 23:48:50 Trade long enough and you'll know the statistic is 100% true:  9 of 10 #traders keep losing.  So, if everyone is spitting knowledge, and (most) everyone is losing, who the heck do you listen to?  Next tweet for answer....

40 2019-01-18 23:54:52 What if they also wanted to ban bump stocks?
41 2019-01-18 23:53:31 Excellent boss, the rack, thumb screws, stocks. I'm sure the Moggster will have these knocking around his stately pile. It's how he keeps the oiks in order.

44 2019-01-18 23:48:18 Good math there. As long as we debug this old glitchy system just as soon as it fails to set stocks prices properly (ie higher) this math is strong
45 2019-01-18 23:48:08 Why do you want to stay in a club that you think would make it impossible for us to get vital medicine? Also, the link above says that stocks are going to be fine. They have months worth of supplies.
46 2019-01-18 23:47:25 Also, a friend of mine panic sold many of the stocks I like/own in late December and now all but one is up 30-60%. Never sell in a panic! He bough index funds so he did make some back, but wow what a bad idea.
47 2019-01-18 23:47:21 The stocks will crash again in late January or February. Taking my words.
48 2019-01-18 23:47:13 Okay I’ve been making anywhere between 5%-10% of gains in stocks every single day. Now imagine if i had 1k as Capitol. That’s $50-$100 every single day. While i sleep........ i think i mastered the game. Still need lil bit more practice. Don’t wanna take my dads money just yet
49 2019-01-18 23:46:45 People who own stocks on the stock exchange don’t do what people who own crypto do to each other. It’s almost at religious level now. Geez
