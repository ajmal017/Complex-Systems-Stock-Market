0 2018-05-09 23:59:58 If congress had any balls and decency they would stop trump’s plans to drill for oil in National Parks and other government owned land that had prohibited drilling in the past !  Russia has new found oil so now they’ve used trump they will make billions
1 2018-05-09 23:59:57 I feel like Trump's end goal all along was to make sure the Middle East wipes itself out so Russia can then expand and take over all the oil reserves. Golan Heights is just the beginning.
2 2018-05-09 23:59:51 Oil is very much in demand these days
3 2018-05-09 23:59:46 Plenty of coconut oil here, man. This isn't amateur radio.
4 2018-05-09 23:59:32 Trump like a wet monkey. ISIS isn't going away until we get the hell out of their affairs. We started this bullshit back in 1979 for oil, minerals & money. Until someone says stop it will continue. Congress & big money people are having a field day at the expense of our military.
5 2018-05-09 23:59:29 As much as I despise Trump, he’s great for oil prices!
6 2018-05-09 23:59:26 Squeaky wheel gets the oil. Obesity is a far more pressing issue in the states at the moment. Especially with people fighting to destigmatize it
7 2018-05-09 23:59:14 Oil prices wont soar. The Saudis, who never supported the JCPOA, will simply open the spigot on their oil production. The war is going on daily in the Middle East. Tensions between Sunni and Shia are at all time high. Iran has placed itself all over ME.
8 2018-05-09 23:59:14 I’m sure it won’t if you set it with powder. I put baby oil on my face before putting it on and it still feels sorta dry lol

11 2018-05-09 23:58:59 No question ETE could do a take under, and Warren is a snake oil type, but take under is a matter of degree. I think the market has vastly overestimated that degree...Simply I think ETP trading at 20-22 more than adequately adjusts for risks.

14 2018-05-09 23:58:45 Plenty of info matched up.  The RUS oil deal was dead on. 
But the dossier did not start the investigation. Likely Flynn or Carter Page or Eric Prince’s sketchy conversations were picked up by our five eyes partners and they started paying attention.

Israel sends missiles at Iranian hard targets in Syria
WTF Dean Israel will start a war 
Netanyahu & Trump both need distractions 
Oil prices up 
Gasoline prices up
Russia television broadcasts 8 trillion rubles in windfall
Israel is the only nuclear armed nation
33 2018-05-09 23:58:10 What?

Big Oil is our Golden Calf.

Kneel!
34 2018-05-09 23:58:09 You hope, Russia gains nothing by sitting out the ME crisis, too much oil left on the table to walk away.  After supporting Assad I doubt Russia backs off. #netanyahudelusion Israel beware you are headed to your armageddon with Netanyahu.
35 2018-05-09 23:58:02 Wait.  
So NO coconut oil on this one?  
#SadFace
36 2018-05-09 23:58:01 I work in the oilfield. Higher oil prices means higher wages and more work. This is a secondary bonus. Thank you @realDonaldTrump
37 2018-05-09 23:57:35 i need some oil for my hair
38 2018-05-09 23:57:30 How does that help the Russians? They have a fuckton of oil. Iran has a fuckton of oil. We have a fuckton of oil but we buy for some reason. Seriously, how will this help Russia?
39 2018-05-09 23:57:26 @keepitzee I want some of those veggie rolls with the chicken sopa and those cheese stuffed squares that you and momma make & that one cheese with a type of oil that you made me once 
40 2018-05-09 23:57:11 Same! I went with a spinach, garlic (3 cloves), mixed berries, walnuts, hemp seeds, coconut oil, lemon and Himalayan salt shake. Imma knock this shit out over night. I can’t stand being sick.
41 2018-05-09 23:57:08 I want to swim in a pool of coconut oil
42 2018-05-09 23:57:03 High oil prices mean higher prices on everything
43 2018-05-09 23:56:49 He also showed his allegiance to the stock market and oil companies.

45 2018-05-09 23:56:32 Climate change deniers everywhere, say you are making this all up and that they should keep driving their Daddy’s 1969 hemi Charger until the last barrel of oil is consumed. Because they know better - right?
46 2018-05-09 23:56:27 Donald's friends happen to sell oil...
47 2018-05-09 23:56:19 فى عام 1974 قال وزير الخزانة الأمريكية وليم سيمون عن العرب الجملة التالية : These People Do Not Owen The Oil , They Only Sit On It والترجمة الحرفية للجملة " هذه الشعوب - ويقصد طبعا الحكام العرب - لا يملكون البترول ، أنهم فقط يجلسون عليه " أى غفراء فقط .. هكذا كان ولا زال ينظرون
48 2018-05-09 23:56:10 Just Got My Next 2 Oil Change Will Be For Free  #Yessss
49 2018-05-09 23:56:03 i’ll get on that oil / acid / salt tip one of these days. got a bottled vinaigrette that i gotta polish of first.
50 2018-05-09 23:56:03 They’re already going up. They’ll be $5 a gallon by 2020. Trump’s paying back the Russians and his oil company donors. Shhh! Here that crunching sound? That’s the wheels of the bus he just threw y’all under.
51 2018-05-09 23:55:57 Brought my car in for an oil change and forgot to turn off the Bluetooth. Whoever is in my car got to listen to some Shovel Knight. Hope they're liking that.
52 2018-05-09 23:55:34 Oil?
53 2018-05-09 23:55:34 Go get em @j66anderson
54 2018-05-09 23:55:25 This is why my brother voted for DonCon, oil prices. Sad but it's true. His company is a vacuum service to pump are guess wash out pumping stations.Which the price of oil really benefits him. He don't care if it hit 100 a barrel.Yes we have disputes over it. Rather arguments.
55 2018-05-09 23:55:08 Look at California's roster, man. Dianne Feinstein, Kamala Harris, Nancy Pelosi, Ted Lieu, Maxine Waters, Eric Swalwell. There's something in the air out there, and it ain't patchouli.
56 2018-05-09 23:55:00 Look like she'll change your oil, filter, and check tire pressure "Hands Looking Ass"
57 2018-05-09 23:54:57 To start a world war just to distract attention from himself and his crooked Israeli counterpart is the lowest of the low. A world conflagration will do no good to any country's economy, not even Russia who hopes for more oil sales from this.
58 2018-05-09 23:54:54 The banks, the military industrial complex, the energy companies, all the other corporations as well as the oligarchs do not want Iran selling oil in Euro, it would destroy the USD as the world reserve currency, dramatically reducing US power, likely collapsing the empire. #money
59 2018-05-09 23:54:53 Our prices were up before the announcement. I thought we were done getting oil from Iran, Iraq and such.
60 2018-05-09 23:54:40 Yup.... that’s dead, I need some beard oil and a gym 
61 2018-05-09 23:54:36 -use tea tree oil to dry out the pimples 
-take your makeup if gently not to harsh
62 2018-05-09 23:54:34 Aku baru pertama pake face oil dan beli kleveru, bagus kok seminggu udah keliatan hasil, ngga tau kalo haple
63 2018-05-09 23:54:30 @HardballChris you know this, Vladimir doesn't like the Iran deal, it's Oil-for-Food 2.0. Everybody looking. Kim broke his testing apparatus & can only sell off his nuclear product. So, ditch the Iran deal & set NK to go retail. As in O-for-F look for majors to get well.

66 2018-05-09 23:54:20 I thought it was the 50 shades girl.
67 2018-05-09 23:54:19 You prepare a table before me, in the presence of my enemies. You annoit my head with oil; my cup overflows. 
68 2018-05-09 23:54:19 Op-ed in @TheHayride by Randy Hayden, oil/gas lobbyist, calls for LA residents to "reject" attempts by "out of state agitators" to block #BayouBridgePipeline. Unclear exactly what he's advocating. Hayden also fails to mention that he has worked on behalf of BBP developers..
69 2018-05-09 23:54:13 I have oil fields in Texas pumping money in my account. Mineral rights are awesome!
70 2018-05-09 23:54:02 They both were in The Help.
71 2018-05-09 23:53:55 Guys this nasty smelling hair oil my mom made is actual magic i cannotttt my hair hasn’t felt and looked this healthy since I dyed it blue two years ago.
72 2018-05-09 23:53:53 Freshly shaven legs + coconut oil is the best feeling ever.
73 2018-05-09 23:53:45 If my country was the #3 exporter of oil, I’d choose both for $500 Alex. People will always need oil and unless our carrier groups patrol every sea, I’ll be able to sell my oil. Looks like another bad idea just for spite’s sake. You still haven’t told me why it was a bad idea
74 2018-05-09 23:53:07 So angry. What is this world coming to when you can’t even have your own thoughts and opinions. 90% of the music I listen to is by people that I have differences of opinions with. And btw apparently you owe your success to Oil and Alberta (said this on CBC Edmonton)
75 2018-05-09 23:52:55 Mystery Babylon The Mother Of Harlots, described in the Bible must be in Arabia. The Harlot must be connected to Arabia, not Rome or New York or any other nation and ancient Babylon (Iraq), babylon whore for oil in return gold, she exists geographically in a desert region.
76 2018-05-09 23:52:51 got off early, got my oil checked, about to shower & get in the bed

Oil on gray paper print
78 2018-05-09 23:52:36 Nigga will buy some supreme engine oil dumb ass nigga . I’m on yo shit
79 2018-05-09 23:52:30 Is this "how Trump" gets the oil from a country? Relating to his campaign comment of why US hasn't just seized oil from countries it has conquered. Is that ultimate goal? Can't think of any other logical reason for this stupid decision.
80 2018-05-09 23:52:29 Come on out this fall. The Lucas Oil Late Model Series puts on a great show!
81 2018-05-09 23:52:11 If US can buy oil in US dollars, which they can just print, it is effectively free.
It explains why they are so upset.
82 2018-05-09 23:52:08 Even Dawn dish soap that cleansed the oil ridden feathers of ducks, victimized by oil spills, cannot clean my glasses. I have lost all hope.
83 2018-05-09 23:52:01 if u went in for an oil change ur coming out with a whole bunch of stuff u didn’t need 
84 2018-05-09 23:51:51 Okay, I like avocado, but only with oil and vinegar and sea salt that's it#poddust
85 2018-05-09 23:51:41 We're not in Syria for oil, for God's sake. Do some research.
86 2018-05-09 23:51:35 This shit taking forever smh this why I hate getting my oil changed
87 2018-05-09 23:51:33 oil new highs , lots of activity in Middle East rn
88 2018-05-09 23:51:13 Israel is getting bolder now that they can hide behind Trump's skirts and Putin's. You do know a couple of years ago oil was found in the Golan Heights? Putin, Trump and Netanyahu want in on the action.
89 2018-05-09 23:51:10 That quote should be force fed at every Ag Tech conference and tattooed on the...of every Ag & food tech VC. 3 mega mergers and cheap oil right now are a freight train to hell and an illusion respectively. #buildsoil #agroecology #biomimicry
90 2018-05-09 23:51:02 I rember it well, discovery of North Sea Gas and oil. I don't remember being told it was going to make the country rich, although it did make me quite rich, but without it the UK national debt would be a lot more than £1,700,000,000,000,000!

95 2018-05-09 23:50:24 Frank, what you’re smelling is the heady perfume of potential cash flow.
What’s certain to go up thanks to our “Don” is the spot price of oil.
96 2018-05-09 23:50:23 “Are you sure that wasn’t TBH oil?” - Nikki trying to say “are you sure that wasn’t THC oil”

100 2018-05-09 23:50:00 How many workers have died making your oil thief’s rich in the past 14 years I’ve worked there? That should include suicide, murders,accidents to and from work and the other baked/electrocuted/drowned and crushed! Then tell the world how long it will be to clean up tailings ponds
101 2018-05-09 23:49:52 My dad put synthetic oil in my car last time he got it changed. He’s about to pay me the difference bc I ain’t got synthetic oil money every time my car needs its oil changed tf
102 2018-05-09 23:49:48 The main reason I will stomach high #oil prices despite them being a regressive tax hurting he poor and emerging markets worst. Higher oil prices make the economics of #renewable energy and #EV much easier sooner.
103 2018-05-09 23:49:38 20分以上の遅延は勘弁な
104 2018-05-09 23:49:28 I just turned down Portillos... for a big homemade salad with the following: arugula, baby spinach, raw crumbled cauliflower, grape tomatoes, strawberries, broiled salmon and topped with balsamic reduction and olive oil.

Who am I and when did this happen?
105 2018-05-09 23:49:23 Putin is bery happy about Trump getting out of the Iranian deal. Price of oil will go up making more money for him. Now he will push a pipe line to the sea.
106 2018-05-09 23:49:20 No OIL, No LIFE!!!
107 2018-05-09 23:49:10 Finally got an oil diffuser and I’m in love.

111 2018-05-09 23:48:50 (1)Aloe Vera as Night Cream
Apply aloe vera gel all over your face and leave it overnight
Wash your face next morning. It will not only keep your skin well moisturized but will also make it tighter.The gel also cleanses and nourishes the skin and removes oil and dirt the big pore
112 2018-05-09 23:48:50 Hot oil treatment , wash and deeeep condition. Oh yeah. Curls is poppin 
113 2018-05-09 23:48:45 Rt @almasirah Akhi, what's of strategic significance isn't da dry port. To administer da coup de grace is targeting their oil industry
114 2018-05-09 23:48:00 Maybe you should stop trying to inflame the region and stop funding terrorist groups like the Houthis, al Qaeda, Hamas, Hezbollah, Assad, and others? And you dont need nuclear fuel. Its a lie. You have enough oil for a lifetime.
115 2018-05-09 23:47:45 4. massage your eyelashes with oil or petroleum jelly!

116 2018-05-09 23:47:43 Obama's policies made American domestic oil production unprofitable, likely for the same reasons he decided to ship pallets of cash to Iran. Domestic oil production is magically picking up again under Trump.
117 2018-05-09 23:47:42 I am in a quandary. Are the drug companies or oil companies more contemptible?
118 2018-05-09 23:47:33 Wait, you interpret him describing Cohen as a snake oil salesman as a defense of him?
119 2018-05-09 23:47:25 Yep. That's life.
120 2018-05-09 23:47:19 Olive oil is the way to a long life
121 2018-05-09 23:47:02 A cynic would state that Trump broke the Iran deal to cause oil prices went up a lot in order to satisfy the US energy industry. The cynic is probably right.
122 2018-05-09 23:46:55 Me: I feel ugly
Brain: bathe in gasoline and set yourself on fire
Me: WITH THESE OIL PRICES???
123 2018-05-09 23:46:34 Lemon oil strong af but work fast af
124 2018-05-09 23:46:34 Oil prices are already up and nobody is talking about it. We're close to $3/gallon here again
125 2018-05-09 23:46:32 1-US is an oil exporter so we win (first time in a very long time fyi)
2-What about Brexit?
3-We sell arms to all our allies - again US wins
You suck at this
126 2018-05-09 23:46:29 Chef Ramses cut up some Pikmin, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was veal, along with Silly Putty.
127 2018-05-09 23:46:23 Of course I’d forget to put oil on my arms but not my legs
128 2018-05-09 23:46:18 How high do you think oil prices are going to rise, and how fast?
129 2018-05-09 23:45:46 I use this bamboo charcoal face wash and a rosehip face wash then moisturize with Palmers coconut oil body lotion ma 
130 2018-05-09 23:45:41 well don't they want the oil
131 2018-05-09 23:45:29 Trump is invested in an oil company who abuses Natives, disgraced Blacks, Immigrants, Muslims, Africans, protects white ISIS aka white nationalists and he deserves a Nobel Peace Prize? Really? Again Obama has one, so his jealousy continues... Give me one too and all my family!!
132 2018-05-09 23:45:14 If he were really concerned with how gas prices affect the poor,he’d promote drilling here at home so we aren’t dependent on foreign oil
133 2018-05-09 23:45:11 you haven't lived until you've cried to fuckin wing kink oil

135 2018-05-09 23:45:06 I can't tell honestly. I'm always paranoid my breath smells bad, so I use coconut oil to oil pull after I brush.
136 2018-05-09 23:45:01 8:30pm  Guiliani still awake? He really is burning the late night oil.
137 2018-05-09 23:44:46 Oil prices zzz always go up on the summer. And they were making those bombs with the 150 billion Hussain Obama gave them!!
138 2018-05-09 23:44:32 Just after 10.30am, I’ll be reviewing ‘Chappaquiddick’ and ‘Midnight Oil 1984’ on @abcgoldcoast.
139 2018-05-09 23:44:29 every night I use tea tree oil and every night I accidentally get it in my mouth and every night I wanna die

142 2018-05-09 23:44:07 Try using a VERY small amount of natural coconut oil
143 2018-05-09 23:44:06 Just wait til you discover castor oil. Level 2.
144 2018-05-09 23:44:05 From a totally geeky academic standpoint: I am really looking forward to seeing whether or not the discourse around the EU palm oil biofuel ban changes now with our newfangled ~~press freedom~~ and a new government in power
145 2018-05-09 23:43:47 i am loving this warmer weather but that means my oily face is much more noticeable and said oil also appears way faster

148 2018-05-09 23:43:33 @abcnews ask Peter Garret about their hypocrisy. How dare they put down the miners of this country whilst flying in aluminium planes and using steel and oil to preach.
I thought everyone had seen through them.
149 2018-05-09 23:43:29 mix non-iodized salt & water and heat it for just like 10 seconds and soak it every night! then keep cleaning it with saline like normal and do tea tree oil everyday 
150 2018-05-09 23:43:27 Russia is an oil exporter - they have no need for more, just higher prices.    Dumb argument
151 2018-05-09 23:43:20 I’m scared of hot oil
152 2018-05-09 23:43:18 So you've been listening to Atlantic oil riggers?
153 2018-05-09 23:43:17 they want oil.

Wash your car? Change the oil? Scrub your floors? Yes. Yes. YES!!
156 2018-05-09 23:42:53 buying oil paint supplies got me in my feelings
157 2018-05-09 23:42:46 I grew up in Comanche county. Opposite you. Never knew much about Creek county except oil drilling. You did good!
158 2018-05-09 23:42:35 Russia had always supported higher oil prices whether or not in concert with OPEC, in any event US technology has allowed us to reach oil production levels that have once again made us a net exporter.
159 2018-05-09 23:42:16 Gin and Tonic.. A fat oil doobie and access to my girls boobies.. It's a glorious day when the sun shines smiles all over my face..
160 2018-05-09 23:42:12 Don't @ToyotaCanada cars and trucks that Jann represents still use that evil Alberta oil? 
Not to mention a lot of Jann's album sales are to folks who work in that evil industry.

162 2018-05-09 23:41:59 Putin got a huge payout from oil.   Bibi is getting his war. The two of them were together celebrating today  #irandealbreakerconflictmaker
163 2018-05-09 23:41:57 "Oil demand" is growing. Supply is dwindling. Can't allow for Texas tycoons and the Liberals to continue creating exaggerated 'endless supply' of oil. Canada must switch it's focus to clean, renewable energy, that has proven economical stability is not at threat.
164 2018-05-09 23:41:44 Yes the entire discussion was not just about oil.
165 2018-05-09 23:41:40 Ewwww baked lays... they’ll make oil come out of your butt 
166 2018-05-09 23:41:25 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
167 2018-05-09 23:41:23 This sounds like a false flag operation funded by big oil
168 2018-05-09 23:41:19 Is tree oil good for the face?
169 2018-05-09 23:41:12 We do not have oil and we are Muslims is the problem @realDonaldTrump @KremlinRussia_E @francediplo_EN @10DowningStreet #XiJinping @UN
170 2018-05-09 23:41:08 WoW it's a strange thing...@realDonaldTrump
"We" are now exporting more crude oil in decades. But yet my gas prices are almost 3 dollars!

I thought there were deals that were in place? I guess thoes stormy deals can't bring me a good gas price!!

When the oil is removed the natural disaster has been cleaned up by man!
173 2018-05-09 23:40:33 One thing for sure @CardinalDolan made it hard on all the "youth ministers" who every year must reject immodest Confirmation dresses to the young laides who want to look sexy for their bishops when they go up for the oil
174 2018-05-09 23:40:32 It's a daily for me, but only olive oil in my beard. It's sensitive.
175 2018-05-09 23:40:31 I guess she didn't know the USA has its own oil reserves
176 2018-05-09 23:40:30 Me, too. Also, for the shrinking of our National Parks and leasing the freed up land to oil, gas and mineral "development," which is actually destruction.

182 2018-05-09 23:40:00 And now rising oil prices
183 2018-05-09 23:39:52 Apologies, my psychosis put words in your text that were not there. It created a different impression than you meant to create. Sorry about that. I usually catch those things and today I goofed up.

184 2018-05-09 23:39:39 The shots can be painful and some people notice a fall off towards the end of the shot period/towards the next shot. The testosterone comes in an oil so it's thick. 

I've also had gel -> shots -> gel. 

My question would be is if you're happy with where you are at?
185 2018-05-09 23:39:36 Um... yes they & we do @cathmckenna .... so: no kinder morgan pipelne, no payouts to oil tycoons etc... otherwise it looks very much like the harper days. #shameforcanada
186 2018-05-09 23:39:26 Iran would have to fall for Russia to get anything more than oil price upheaval out of it. I could see that too - they must drool over Gulf access

188 2018-05-09 23:39:18 It doesn't matter if Iran starts the nuclear program or not the whole point is the Pentagon wants to go bomb Iran and get the oil fields and get the petrodollar going again just like Iraq the Pentagon will simply blame Iran... you don't need proof just blame

190 2018-05-09 23:39:02 Trump's idea to steal Iraq's oil would be "plundering"—a war crime per Geneva Conventions. I could at least wrap my mind around the idea of stealing from a country you vanquish (wrong as it is). But what makes it all the crazier is that we went in as liberators, NOT conquerors.
191 2018-05-09 23:38:42 Will never happen. US is the worlds largest oil producer if u didn’t know.
192 2018-05-09 23:38:39 If the president says something it should be true, you said the price of oil is too high while the world is flooded by oil and yet the price is still climbing. The price of food is climbing also.  I am wondering who I should believe.

195 2018-05-09 23:38:28 Interesting how Trump's exit from the Iran deal has put a big boost for oil prices - a big revenue gain for the Russian government #MAGA2018
196 2018-05-09 23:38:17 Is it understood but unspoken that Trump pulled out of the Iran deal in order to increase demand/oil prices for Russia?
197 2018-05-09 23:38:03 "The church 3 months behind on the mortgage yall. Everyone meet me and the pastor down at the track with a $20, some prayer oil and the faith of a mustard seed"

201 2018-05-09 23:37:39 Has anyone tried CBD oil for migraines/headaches?
202 2018-05-09 23:37:39 My Dad always said you eat an apple one bite at a time, until you have a better replacement for coal than oil it’s better to do something to improve the situation rather than do nothing.
203 2018-05-09 23:37:23 if that shit is cooked with some olive oil, it’s good in my book. if not, it can go to hell
204 2018-05-09 23:37:15 Really, I’d rather pay less at the gas pump and allow our workers to freely pump oil!! It’s a political farce that we need foreign oil.
205 2018-05-09 23:36:58 Yes this is true. But I see no reason for the politicians to waste so much money travelling (esp. the PCs in Alberta who had their own planes cuz they were so oil monarch). Transportation of goods would go down if we ate locally and grew some of our own food. It was done before.
206 2018-05-09 23:36:56 Just check out plans for oil development in Alaska, the pipeline which was approved, the lack on action on clean water in Flint and other locations etc.
207 2018-05-09 23:36:49 you need some of my special oil !!
208 2018-05-09 23:36:37 If China and India offer to step up and buy more Iranian oil, you're correct. But U.S. allies/trading partners are going to have curtail their purchased volumes by 20%. That is countries such as South Korea, Japan, and several European countries. Lack of buying, not selling.

211 2018-05-09 23:35:53 After Pruitt is done, we won't need another bridge in Manhattan, you'll be able to walk across the effluent... if you're suicidal. But on the plus side, the locals can set it afire on really cold days to get some extra heat. They sure won't be able to afford heating oil. Sigh!
212 2018-05-09 23:35:52 What if you drink water,don’t mind your own business & really can’t use coconut oil like that?

221 2018-05-09 23:34:47 His premise is flawed - stocks have been going up for a number of reasons-he just picked oil prices to make a point, but more than the rich do well when stocks rise - many people have 401k investments. Gas prices rise and fall - they even out as supply and demand adjust.

238 2018-05-09 23:33:02 Russia wants higher oil prices more than they want most things
239 2018-05-09 23:32:54 Oil prices were high in 2013 then a big fall of in 2014 & have been rising since, the us doesn’t control the global price of oil, some policy might cause slight change in price but nothing substantial
240 2018-05-09 23:32:54 ...or that "Israeli positions" are actually on illegally occupied Syrian land.
...or that Rothschild, Murdoch and Cheney were granted the drilling rights to the Golan Heights oil... by the Israelis.

250 2018-05-09 23:31:30 Bought in last Nov at $35 and again in April for same price. Sold positions today even though it could go higher. Oil also seems like it's full priced IMO.  $XOP/$USO.
251 2018-05-09 23:31:29 Andrew we have evidence of giving people animal rich foods & them developing chronic disease. We also have evidence of giving same people whole plant based foods (no oil, sugar, minimal salt and minimal professed) and REVERSING disease (not managing but referring).
252 2018-05-09 23:31:22 This part of the narrative skips over some complexity: Congress was lukewarm on GAF & delayed oil fuel shipments; KEDO & US slow to implement its side and dragged feet on many elements (normalization, LWR builds); the 2002 HEU claim from James Kelly was the nail in the coffin.

264 2018-05-09 23:30:13 Tar sands existed long before a shovel hits the ground. I love a clean environment too but it has to be balanced with good economic strategies. Increase our oil exports and offload the revenues into renewable energy infrastructures.

276 2018-05-09 23:29:27 Yes!! With ENGINE OIL...
277 2018-05-09 23:29:26 It's the same reason there hasn't been a full push for emission free vehicles from all car manufacturers. Their pockets are lined with big money from the oil industry. The product to clean our waterways exists just like this exists but it's not profitable for big business.
278 2018-05-09 23:29:21 I have to mash them up but I’ve eaten them for all the reasons you mention (the oil is good for the heart)
279 2018-05-09 23:29:21 The @USFWSAlaska is the land manager for the Refuge. Why is @BLMAlaska the lead agency for an EIS that is not on their land? This is highly unusual. Is it because BLM has a multiple-use mandate and is in the business of handing out oil and gas permits? Feels like the fix is in.
280 2018-05-09 23:28:56 Can’t wait to watch Friday! You guys are awesome
281 2018-05-09 23:28:48 Should I tweet an oil series ??
282 2018-05-09 23:28:23 Ummm...nope they do not. My father was in the oil/gas business since the 60s & he always said..."Here comes the demand boom...crops harvesting, people taking vacations...let the bitchin' begin!"
283 2018-05-09 23:28:10 Hey David. Did you miss the news that later this year, the US will become the #1 exporter in the WORLD of oil? Of course not, how would he because all he can do is overdose on the Stormy Daniels sex shows. Cranial Rectumitus is not the way to go through life. Wise up.
284 2018-05-09 23:28:07 I think oil is off topic for IME... but as far as oil goes it is good that you are making predictions and then adjusting them as things change. The prices have been bullish lately. Analysts reviews are mixed... so we should keep adjusting as need be.
285 2018-05-09 23:27:52 I need my body oil this oatmeal lotion not cutting it 
286 2018-05-09 23:27:43 You do know Iran isn't the only country with oil right?
287 2018-05-09 23:27:39 LOL, never.  Russians love the price of oil here.  Plus, unless the Russians want to start a nuclear war, they do not have the assets to make any difference.
288 2018-05-09 23:27:38 So many people, so many companies, whose success and survival depended on the status quo to be maintained. 

Whose main investment was to oil the right wheels and fan the right man.

Oh, to be a fly on some walls right now.
289 2018-05-09 23:27:23 I’ve gotta get an oil change tomorrow. My cars gonna blow up if I keep waiting lmaooo
290 2018-05-09 23:27:16 From a business view it’s even more absurd.  It’s like Rockefeller saying other oil companies can compete while he maintains his anticompetitive position - and that’s competition. 

Sad thing is: This position is informed by MLS attorneys.
291 2018-05-09 23:27:09 That's a good question. Perhaps it's the nature of the beast. Big oil is somewhat distant whereas tech is part of our everyday lives.
292 2018-05-09 23:26:59 If you think pulling out of #IranDealWithdrawl has anything to with nukes and nothing to do with oil your nuts !
293 2018-05-09 23:26:56 He has no plan except on how to line his pockets. Pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal raises oil prices, Russia profits from that so their investment in trump was worthwhile. #DonTheCon #TrumpRussia #TraitorTrump #TrumpCrimeFamily
294 2018-05-09 23:26:56 He did publicly state that not taking their oil was a mistake. He and Putin want Iran’s oil. T is working as an asset. #Impeach45
295 2018-05-09 23:26:42 How may is going for me:
A) My mom wants me to start taking cbd oil.
B)I’ve lost two out of a handful of friends and I’m broken.
C) More depressed and anxious than ever.
D) Thought about staying home from work to contemplate suicide.
E) I missed seeing @ProdByParis live and I-
296 2018-05-09 23:26:37 So Russia has been circumventing NK sanctions to deliver them oil among other things. NK indebted & allied with Russia. We leave Iran deal oil prices go up which benefits Russia & then coincidentally NK releases hostages. Go figure
297 2018-05-09 23:26:36 Let's cut to the chase here.  Russia has a controlling interest or at least an enormous interest in oil.  Trump takes the lid off the Iran deal oil will go way up.  Guess who makes a fortune?  Putin
298 2018-05-09 23:26:23 疲れがたまってるけどまこちゃんパワーで頑張ります！

304 2018-05-09 23:26:10 US killed over a million in Iraq for oil and its Israeli masters.

306 2018-05-09 23:25:33 Massage coconut oil into them every night for like two weeks

309 2018-05-09 23:25:24 Ok I just caused the price of oil to go up by breaking the Iran deal. What next to help ole buddy Vlad?
310 2018-05-09 23:25:24 Shell and BP continue to make money from poor African countries without adding any value. They would rather sponsor such events than invest in educating the poor in the countries they rob oil from sad indeed

314 2018-05-09 23:25:02 SAY NO TO PALM OIL !!
315 2018-05-09 23:24:58 Probably a good time to buy oil and defense stocks!  Nothing like a war in the Middle East to create a financial oportunity!!! @cspanwj #PJNET #TCOT #P2
316 2018-05-09 23:24:50 I feel ya
317 2018-05-09 23:24:48 If Scotland were to gain independence then it would still lose the oil as the majority is held in waters off Orkney and Shetland who have said they will seek independence from Scotland. Or will they be denied that right
318 2018-05-09 23:24:37 Twitterに方言を持ち込むオタックぅ〜〜
319 2018-05-09 23:24:37 try using oil
320 2018-05-09 23:24:23 Buzzfeed doing everything they can ho exacerbate voter fraud.
321 2018-05-09 23:24:18 Idk Putin wants the oil
322 2018-05-09 23:23:58 かなしみ……頑張って探してこ（一週間で3個食べた顔）
323 2018-05-09 23:23:56 He wants a Regime change! He wants the Oil. 
He want #MEK to take over. #MEK who murdered Americans and were branded as terrorists. Do you really thing #MaryumRajavi will be welcomed with open arms in Tehran? Civil war. Destruction.
324 2018-05-09 23:23:51 Would that be an oil well by any chance x
325 2018-05-09 23:23:46 Who steps in to insure Iran’s oil shipments, if not U.S. and Euro cos.?
326 2018-05-09 23:23:43 True story. Was out at happy hour with my department. One of them mentioned that Missourians are wierd because we own machine gun.
I said "huh, I've only ever known one machine gun owner, a high level FBI agent."
"everyone here owns ar15s."
"head desk"
327 2018-05-09 23:23:24 ??? so your saying the dollar will go higher with oil? Seems counter intuitive.
328 2018-05-09 23:23:12 Trump wants any war:
Race war-C’ville, 
Mexico–Trade-DACA, 
NK–Nukes, 
Syria–ISIS?, 
China–Trade, 
Free Press,  
Puerto Rico,
Climate Change–Paris Agreement, 
Environment–Earth poisoning, 
Iran-So can blow up oilfields, siege US, Russia oil makes Ruble reserve currency & USA not.
329 2018-05-09 23:23:08 Oh Jeezuz... Another saying hope you're using ___ made from wood or whatever. I got news for you. They'd LOVE to use hemp plastics derived from cannabis. But guess what, DuPont made hemp farming illegal in the 30's. Hemp does everything oil does AND it's renewable.
330 2018-05-09 23:22:52 Ive been on these oil trades for a while now but its nice to see some people catching up
331 2018-05-09 23:22:50 Higher oil prices may be true motivation for  pulling out of the Iran Deal.
332 2018-05-09 23:22:50 Pas forcément, chaque peau réagit différemment.. i tried coconut oil and its a blessing  mais im usually on lemon and honey.
333 2018-05-09 23:22:48 اكذب ماحبه ولا احب ريحته
334 2018-05-09 23:22:47 If only the UK realised Nigeria had OIL the would have hung on to them like they were ..... Scots!!
335 2018-05-09 23:22:42 Why not do a story on Rothschilds,Murdock+Cheney having the oil rights at the Golan heights in Syria called Genie Energy.I would expect the mainstream news not to cover,but not independent news.Dual citizens Zionist traitors to America.
336 2018-05-09 23:22:42 My mayo white skin glistens, Jay. IT GLISTENS LIKE THAT SHEEN OF OIL ON MAYO LEFT OUT A LITTLE TOO LONG AT THE FAMILY BBQ.
337 2018-05-09 23:22:35 Just like water and oil don’t mix, Quran and music can’t stay in the same heart together. It’s either the words of Allah ﷻ or shaytan. A reminder to myself first.
338 2018-05-09 23:22:24 Why is this oil change taking so long?
339 2018-05-09 23:22:06 if you can't find a place to vote, or are too lazy to cast a vote, you're worthless.

341 2018-05-09 23:21:53 Down here teachers been striking for more pay. I was surprised to hear Lathrop's athletic director got cut for budgeting. Alaska's government has huge revenues with the oil field royalties
342 2018-05-09 23:21:47 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
343 2018-05-09 23:21:40 I worry about folk that can't get off their freaking dead butt to participate
344 2018-05-09 23:21:38 Economic catastrophes from losing Iran deal:

- Oil prices up, oil supply down
- $20bn Boeing contract toileted
- $20bn Airbus contract (partially?) toileted -- some planes already delivered

This literally destroys the American worker and went by with cheers from supporters
345 2018-05-09 23:21:34 なぁ部屋の気温、夜27℃で今16℃とかお前は情緒不安定なんか？精神病んだらおえんぞ？病院いけーよ？
346 2018-05-09 23:21:29 It seems extremely important for Trump to reverse everything Obama had done during his 8 years. Imposing new sanctions on Iran will only strengthen Iran’s ties to China and Russia - and lift the price of oil, at least temporarily.
347 2018-05-09 23:21:27 yESS omg going castor oil
348 2018-05-09 23:21:24 Estonia has had online national elections for years. Totally secure. Multi-factor authentication. Real-time results.

It's stupid we don't have it now.
349 2018-05-09 23:21:22 Mahal ng tsubaki oil. Kaiyak
350 2018-05-09 23:21:08 Now, Putin is laughing at us. He gets higher oil prices and opportunity to sell more arms to Iran, who also gets more oil revenue.
351 2018-05-09 23:21:07 Burning the midnight oil, still marking. Refuelling with Oude Amsterdammer 
352 2018-05-09 23:21:02 I just paid $232 for an oil change and a detail with @GetSpiffy. The result was fine, neat that it was done at my office, but they totally lost my @McKinneyBand magnet and mostly tore off my @galanorthtx sticker D:
353 2018-05-09 23:20:59 not another oil war hyperbole.
354 2018-05-09 23:20:58 おいしいよね。

ところでチョコミントパフェを見つけたコンビニ、ポプラって言うらしい　ｵｰｻｶにあるかな
355 2018-05-09 23:20:54 Positive? Only if you play checkers This is chess So Russia has been circumventing NK sanctions to deliver them oil among other things NK indebted & allied with Russia. We leave Iran deal oil prices go up which benefits Russia & then coincidentally NK releases hostages. Go figure
356 2018-05-09 23:20:50 Yeah, we depend on oil too much, you're right. Let's invest in alternatives, and stop subsidizing big oil. Agreed?
357 2018-05-09 23:20:47 What CBD oil MLMs are out there?  Kannaway, Hempworx, and CTFO.  Any others I'm missing?
358 2018-05-09 23:20:42 .@SchuetteOnDuty We ought to build a tunnel under the Straits of Mackinac for Line 5 oil and other infrastructure.
359 2018-05-09 23:20:37 Yeah that's a hell no
360 2018-05-09 23:20:33 A little sugar, plenty of cream, a dash of cinnamon. Sometimes I add a spoonful of coconut oil when I want to give it some body. In holiday times I like to throw in a little candy cane too. Brewing it directly into some sweet condensed milk is always A++

362 2018-05-09 23:20:29 Colloidal graphite (excl. in suspension in oil and semi-colloidal graphite) 43,1 €/kg change -0,21%
363 2018-05-09 23:20:28 Every @wheelerdealers episode:
Mike buys a $5k car for $3k
Shows you how to change the oil
Puts it through a car wash
Sells it back to the same guy for $7k
364 2018-05-09 23:20:28 “im tired, grown, stressed and work in an oil field. i’m a product of my environment.”
365 2018-05-09 23:20:15 In GOP debate, Calley on Line 5: "We need to eliminate the risk of having the oil run through the Straits....The comeback of Michigan requires that we take care of our resources."
366 2018-05-09 23:20:15 i took my car in for a diagnostic & oil change. thought it had a lot of problems, but they said it’s in good condition so it’s time for me to pick my reckless driving habits up again.
367 2018-05-09 23:20:11 After 2 years of pain, Canadian energy stocks are surging. When oil ticked up last month, so did our yield curve.
368 2018-05-09 23:20:06 Shoulder the way Dennis, show us the way through.  Then take their oil and all their other assets.  Legacy media is focusing on the loss of business Boeing is going to suffer.  Boeing is sitting pretty without Iran!
369 2018-05-09 23:20:05 It was Hillary eating pizza in a basement coated in uranium that jacked up oil prices. Get your facts straight. Oh and the oil cos are all deep state against trump. There.
370 2018-05-09 23:20:02 LOL This is ripe. Oil Companies don't need thousands up on thousands of Earth Scientists to write up nonsense. I worked for the CDC for 3 years, I know how it works. Buckets of Money, 3,000 page responses to CBO to justify more $
371 2018-05-09 23:19:54 .@briancalley We have to be proactive. We need to eliminate the risk of rupture of Line 5. Need to take other options of transporting oil under the Straits of Mackinac.
372 2018-05-09 23:19:54 So Russia has been circumventing NK sanctions to deliver them oil among other things. NK indebted & allied with Russia. We leave Iran deal oil prices go up which benefits Russia & then coincidentally NK releases hostages. Go figure
373 2018-05-09 23:19:31 It is not exploitation but seizing the opportunity so as long as there might be an acute shortage of oil supply if US imposed Sanctions  against Iran  then Saudi Arabia can compensate the shortfall since it is a leading producer to fulfill its obligations

375 2018-05-09 23:19:28 WATCH THE PRICE OF OIL 

WAR IN MIDDLE EAST BREAKING OUT

376 2018-05-09 23:19:28 Why do lipidologists use fish oil as an antidote to high trigs?
377 2018-05-09 23:19:23 Any estimates out there on how many U.S. troops it would take to topple the #IranianRegime and occupy the country?

I'm asking for unconcerned President and Prime Minister.

Suggestions box now open for euphemistic non-war "Operation" name. (Nothing with "oil" in it.)

#IranWar
378 2018-05-09 23:19:22 If America show people on television being freed everyday, war will not exist, itz going on bcuz we being mistreated, prisonz, jailz, land, oil, gold, diamondz, race & religion!!! #USA
379 2018-05-09 23:19:16 全ての料理はオイルなしに作れない…(作れるのもあるかも、え、あるのかなぁ)

381 2018-05-09 23:18:59 Um.. So your cool with oil prices rising and potential nuclear apocalypse? I know you republicans love fear mongering, why is Iran with nukes not triggering you?
382 2018-05-09 23:18:54 Bruce Dallas Howard is prettier.
383 2018-05-09 23:18:47 Ok gotchu so the oil isn't thick?
384 2018-05-09 23:18:45 Naah. Too much oil. And the ability to see Russia from one’s house in Wasilla.

that's it
388 2018-05-09 23:18:35 Did he remember to add in heating oil if you use it because that alone is going to be close to $1000 extra for next winter.
389 2018-05-09 23:18:23 Aw that's s shame! The MAGAtes undoubtedly drive predominantly large pickups & SUVs! Pitty & SAD! :( poor things!

I pay about $1.50 for 60 miles EV in my libtard, snowflake-mobile!

Don't give a shit about oil, oh yeah, my electric feed in all Hydro & Solar here in WA.
390 2018-05-09 23:18:16 Regardless of how you want to categorize “Iran funds” she right.
I guess you would prefer we do as Trump suggested and pilfer oil and money from other nations.maga
391 2018-05-09 23:18:15 おこですよおこ。
392 2018-05-09 23:18:10 You realize that plastic is an oil product
Planes, Boats, Semi-trucks, etc that transport your food, dry goods, leisure travel, etc need oil products
The energy plants that produces transfers energy needs oil products

When oil cost rises, we all lose
393 2018-05-09 23:18:02 damn takes longer to wash and oil a girl's hair than you'd think. should be dropping a link to the song in the next hour or two.

396 2018-05-09 23:17:51 Ranch is fucking disgusting, salad dressings besides oil and vinegar are for rich white women.
397 2018-05-09 23:17:46 I can understand your view point only if US or Russia were not in the region... Pull them out and there will be (maybe some fighting first but) peace in the region. The region's blessing and curse is its geopolitical position but more importantly being a source for oil and energy

416 2018-05-09 23:16:26 Energy stocks went up because of US pulling out of Iran deal. Oil prices up, good for investors. Bad for everyone who needs gas for their car.

418 2018-05-09 23:16:11 $CL_F Reasons Oil has been rising:
1) Trump nixing Iran Deal.
2) Aramco IPO.
3) Russia punishing Europe for helping USA in Syria.
4) <4% Unemployment. People driving to work!
5) Anticipation of Summer driving season.
6) Stockpiling ahead of Hurricane Season.
7) Speculative Buying
419 2018-05-09 23:16:08 Get a spray bottle and fill it with distilled water and a few drops of tea tree oil, that's kept all my piercings from getting infected!!
420 2018-05-09 23:15:52 As was the case with Israel, we are under threat from the ayatollah and his minions who chant death to the US. Would you allow a nation that wants us dead a nuclear weapon-the same nation that sponsors terror around the globe and has killed many of our troops? We can increase oil
421 2018-05-09 23:15:51 Time to change a 4 banger civic alternator. Don't look to bad and after owning a 350z I think I can replace anything now LOL. Time to get oil grease dirty mechanic hands now baby.
422 2018-05-09 23:15:50 A sonic brush you use to wash your face! You can use the most basic cleanser and it will deep clean dirt, oil, and pollution from your skin. The legit ones are expensive but last forever and worth it. Your skin and beard’s new bff.
423 2018-05-09 23:15:50 Trump has done things which positively improved my life since the inauguration. What snake oil?
424 2018-05-09 23:15:45 California gets 56% of its oil from foreign sources because of the policy choices of its leaders. Maybe they should make the opposite choices
425 2018-05-09 23:15:41 Sir, US is also an oil exporter so benefits the country.
426 2018-05-09 23:15:29 don’t use olive oil to get the screws off ur bed you will fail miserably :)
427 2018-05-09 23:15:24 No we’re not! Don’t let the Israeli government (not the ppl of Israel) drag the world into yet ANOTHER WAR!!! No one wants this except for Israel.
Sorry, I don’t have a sense of humor when it comes to living breathing humans being murdered to make way for ANOTHER OIL PIPELINE
No.
428 2018-05-09 23:15:23 venting is not you're voice
429 2018-05-09 23:15:21 Once again you don't talk about the lost jobs, increased costs of oil/gas, medical benefit costs; or increased food costs. You are nothing but a marketing propaganda talking ASS.
430 2018-05-09 23:15:18 Yeah, but it helps oil revenues!
431 2018-05-09 23:15:14 A lot of foods are beginning to use sustainable palm oil and they indicate on the packaging.
432 2018-05-09 23:15:13 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
433 2018-05-09 23:15:10 This recent Rohingya “cleansing” started when China wanted room for building their oil/gas pipeline terminal & PLA naval base at #Kyaukphyu

434 2018-05-09 23:15:00 Iran's economy is in the toilet. This is ultimately to destabilize the Middle East even more. This is for Drumpf's master Putin. Gas and oil prices will sky rocket everyone one wins right?
435 2018-05-09 23:14:58 This is a bunch of horse poop! I was very skeptical when I first heard they were doing a L.W show but seriously you play this actor so PERFECTLY....Jerks for letting you go!
436 2018-05-09 23:14:53 I'll bring my essential oil misters and my ambience tracks.
437 2018-05-09 23:14:50 David, there is no such thing as an oil expect. Nobody can predict the price of oil. Nobody.
438 2018-05-09 23:14:42 25 Lucas Oil American Sprint Car Series drivers have drawn in at Humboldt Speedway.
439 2018-05-09 23:14:36 Yes it can happen but attacking Iran with a G5 coalition or with second zone countries is a whole different thing. Iran isn’t Syria. They can burn the whole region and harm their oil supply on a very large scale. And one thing americans love more than war is their cheap oil.
440 2018-05-09 23:14:31 Coconut oil and distillate caps FTW
441 2018-05-09 23:14:22 Tea tree oil!
442 2018-05-09 23:14:21 Just wait.  At about 10 AM tomorrow, suddenly gas will be 20 cents higher.  I can almost set my watch by it the day after a big move in oil.
443 2018-05-09 23:13:42 thats unfortunate
444 2018-05-09 23:13:42 Listen... Almond Oil + Shea Butter?? 

Phenomenal.
445 2018-05-09 23:13:26 ありがとうございます。
今日はゆっくり過ごします。
446 2018-05-09 23:13:13 Wow, every time I read responses of people in support of the oil sands I’m shocked all over again. I don’t understand the argument that something is okay because it’s been done for a long time.
447 2018-05-09 23:13:11 Hey, I see the world's doing fine w/o me - the Lords are 'traitors' acc. Thursday's Daily Mail, oil prices are rising because of concerns that shipping in the Persian Gulf might become dangerous (it won't, but you tell that to the US 5th Fleet) - so I'll be at the beach.
448 2018-05-09 23:13:10 America has no interest in South Africa! We have no oil! That is what they are looking for. Trump sees Africa as a waste of space. The plane is probably here for a pit stop or maybe Trump is meeting Cyril at some point in time...

mama: sabi kasi ng pinsan mo 1letter yan eh baka kalahating litro lang.

papa: HAHAHAHAHAH
450 2018-05-09 23:12:56 Us and allied forces took Iranian oil without giving any sort of economic compensation for it. Then Iran holds DEMOCRATIC elections that result in a man who basically said Iranian oil belongs to the Iranians. Then we install a dictator (AJAX)to take back that oil causing turmoil.
451 2018-05-09 23:12:50 There's no reason for this, oh, other than higher profits for greedy oil execs.
452 2018-05-09 23:12:37 You don’t know my STRS board members very well then. You’re actually believing that they are rational  actors out to protect my retirement fund. You are wrong. They’re SJ nutballs
453 2018-05-09 23:12:25 @realDonaldTrump sanctions will hit Iranian oil production.
Oil price predictions $82 barrel over Summer ...

Consider that 
#Iran
454 2018-05-09 23:12:24 So daesh is not coming back because iraqi people wont accept it.Secondly they can only get rid of Iran if US leave their oil field which will result in strengthening their economy and US is not ready for that and they r further pressurising the current govt to privatise their oil
455 2018-05-09 23:12:24 Someone need to educate the masses that oil and gas are not the same commodities. You jackasses were all the time talking about oil price low and daz why the nation so, now it going up you surprised fuel gonna raise 
456 2018-05-09 23:12:20 & order this Pineapple Express oil to go wit it

458 2018-05-09 23:12:11 I used sunscreen once when I was in Jamaica and I swear I felt my skin burning off! I go out now with just coconut oil.
459 2018-05-09 23:12:09 Yeah, I quit drinking, between the oil and that I got my quality of life back. I wish more people would listen to me, I hate seeing people suffer
460 2018-05-09 23:12:08 You’d be impressed by a con artist? People like you are why snake oil salesmen were so successful. You’ll buy anything
461 2018-05-09 23:11:56 Oil?
462 2018-05-09 23:11:49 Hear it from a long-time Tesla bull: EV's won't start cutting into global oil demand until 2025, or a couple of years earlier if Level 5 autonomy is achieved.
463 2018-05-09 23:11:37 Jesus, 3 hrs sleep or less for 3 years now post brain opp, no wonder I am a walking zombie and walk in to things in the morning. I have tried everything,Very pissed off I cant legally access cannabis oil to replace my anti-seizure meds and cure my cancer.Just WRONG !!!
464 2018-05-09 23:11:33 Long and complicated but a few trends. 1) during CW, US focus on securing material interests (eg rubber, oil, etc.) and anti-communism takes over the lens and other concerns, incl Indonesian ones, are secondary to that--which largely explains the  problematic US-RI history then
465 2018-05-09 23:11:22 dropped my oil pen and it cracked, it was more than half a cartridge 
466 2018-05-09 23:11:15 Higher oil prices amid US Irandeal withdrawal will fill up Saudi pockets quicker, but we all know well that what comes with the wind goes with it.
467 2018-05-09 23:11:01 They cook with vegatable oil?

473 2018-05-09 23:10:28 And don’t forget those sweet oil deals!!
474 2018-05-09 23:10:24 I disagree that a non nuclear Iran isnt all that powerful. They're the 1st or 2nd largest supporter of state sponsored terror. They produce a fair amount of oil and have to ability to impede shipping on the straits of Hormuz. They've been involved in a few proxy wars
475 2018-05-09 23:10:23 My project “Decision Support System for Selecting and Deploying AI models for the Oil and Gas industry” was selected by the international jury of #RDPetro in the Artificial Intelligence category. The #toreador ideas were greatly appreciated!

478 2018-05-09 23:09:53 We dont need their oil, wr actually have more of our own
479 2018-05-09 23:09:42 So y’all know I had a hard time with the @beautybakerie cake mix right? So I ordered the wake and bake oil so I could do a Re-try video... y’all....
480 2018-05-09 23:09:41 So no oil filter? Air filter? No oil at all? Changing belts? Distribution?  EGR valve? Nothing? Mmm:)))
481 2018-05-09 23:09:08 Psssht. The Bible commands us to dig for oil in the ocean. Look it up!
482 2018-05-09 23:09:06 Plus! The progressive more rational Iranian MPs were helped by the deal. The dumb Trump has handed more power again to the hardliners. Some deals are not about making money. Trump however has done this to manipulate oil prices and help Saudi and Russia!
483 2018-05-09 23:09:05 Not a myth, it’s all about flavor. Olive oil tastes better as a finishing oil, especially extra virgin olive oil. As a cooking oil, grape seed is the best.
484 2018-05-09 23:09:04 I'm still curious what a Bommarito tastes like. Do they have chicken, or beef? Are they flour tortillas, or corn? 
485 2018-05-09 23:08:49 Omg same!! Came home to breadfruit oil down 
486 2018-05-09 23:08:40 And the Russian economy still sucks and depends on oil.
487 2018-05-09 23:08:02 เสียใจ อดดูเลย
488 2018-05-09 23:07:52 after a Day of witnessing, and trying to witness myself, I finally found myself being witnessed

and I feel (alone & secure)
489 2018-05-09 23:07:50 Not true.  Iran had no money or gold in 1970's.  The US "loaned" them money in exchange for oil they were to transfer to the US for military supplies & technology We sold them/  As the oil was given to us, money was returned to treasury for the weapons/technology we gave them.
490 2018-05-09 23:07:50 Probably worth keeping in mind Aussie is down a touch under 5% in 2018. Oil (WTI) price has gone from just under USD 60 to now over USD 70 in that time.
491 2018-05-09 23:07:50 でっかいアイスwww
492 2018-05-09 23:07:38 Just saw Bloomer TV show #WTI #crude futures up 10c, despite conflict headlines from #Syria, #Israel, #Golan etc. Guess the initial conflict, shots-fired premium was already in #oil's price. Best wait to see how Europe's Thursday assesses it. #OOTT #energy #SyriaStrikes
493 2018-05-09 23:07:34 "Trump is withdrawing US from the #Iran nuclear deal. Oil prices should go up, which is good for (Russia)."

And the penny drops.
494 2018-05-09 23:07:11 Veritable smorgasbord... bribery, extortion, con, threat, blackmail, snake oil... step right up folks.

498 2018-05-09 23:06:43 Deep state clearly run USA, time to clean out hypocrisy , world peace is not something to play with , it’s law to respect it. Sanction Israel /Saudi, until they stop attacking sovereign Syria, Yemen breaking international law. Drop oil, we can grow hemp & celebrate solar spills
499 2018-05-09 23:06:33 The continued use of clove oil in our bathroom for my toothy predicaments has rendered it a Christmas zone from a sensory perspective.
500 2018-05-09 23:06:25 My place smells like sesame oil, ginger, garlic and a bunchafuckin yummmmmmm thanks to @chrissyteigen
501 2018-05-09 23:06:23 My house smells like lemongrass essential oil 
502 2018-05-09 23:06:13 Khaled wasn’t a Sudairi btw. As for Faisal, he may’ve had his flaws but was v popular on the Muslim Street because of the oil embargo so he did actually walk the talk. At the risk of sounding repetitive I’ll just end by saying that I fail to see what KSA would gain from having...
503 2018-05-09 23:05:49 I sure hope not... super concerned about his ability to recover from having only 1/2 a foot... also really nervous about acquisition cost (better not be Drai)
504 2018-05-09 23:05:48 This is exactly what Trump wanted to happen, now he can go in there start bombing.
He wants the oil and uranium.

510 2018-05-09 23:05:08 And the price of oil goes up  stocks go up  the wealthy are happy. Making money while sitting on their ass.
511 2018-05-09 23:05:06 Wonder if Trump dropped out of the Iran deal to help make money on Oil. You bet he did.
512 2018-05-09 23:04:59 Can't wait to see you guys out on the track.  Great job getting ready.  Go 3!!
513 2018-05-09 23:04:58 Huh..That like water going on tour with oil..That shit don't match. C'mon Cole..not him
514 2018-05-09 23:04:53 #Oil and which one of these #currencies tend to be highly correlated?
515 2018-05-09 23:04:51  Ummm... how stupid ARE you, exactly? How about we house you & your entire family into one of the legions of oil refineries in Louisiana’s Cancer Alley for a few years, then when you are all dying from cancer, we ask you about wind power again?
516 2018-05-09 23:04:43 national news, nbc, just stated oil came way down.  still lying and still losing.  your a disgrace and im ashamed we are of the same party.

541 2018-05-09 23:02:10 Now why is that who deals with Iran for Oil? Bushes, Clintons, Obama or which republicans & Democrats! See who complains the most? They know how to spin it
542 2018-05-09 23:02:08 and for Israel to control water/oil, and for America to sell weapons.
543 2018-05-09 23:02:06 Remember tRump's statement about Iraq, "We should have taken the oil" 
seems like he is going to get it one way or one country, somehow and some way.
544 2018-05-09 23:02:05 Genie oil?? I'm sure I've heard somewhere that a well known #mediamogul has connections...
545 2018-05-09 23:02:02 They have done the same with Scottish oil. Seems the government in London no matter of the the colour love oil. 

Seems they don't know were the oil from Scottish waters come from. It's "from unknown sources" in the UK accounts for some reason.
546 2018-05-09 23:01:47 @getswerviced let’s get you connected w/ express oil here in Bham.

547 2018-05-09 23:01:29 Agreed. What about cbd oil?
548 2018-05-09 23:01:22 Despite the car & oil lobbies, cars & gas have been regulated.  Cars have been made increasingly safer w/ seat belts, air bags, crumple  zones, safety glass, &tc. Fuel has been made safer, too, which is  why we have unleaded gas. 6/10
549 2018-05-09 23:01:17 But they've never left power. That's the thing.  Oh sure the left has problems with censorship always has, but are we really going to sit here and compare a comic book cover getting censored to Ken Saro-Wiwa getting executed for writing a poem about Shell Oil?  SERIOUSLY?

553 2018-05-09 23:00:46 And the Americans didn't push it, they Hinderer it. In the early 1900s oil was called black gold because of it immense value to your economy... Also, the concept of running one efficiently with battery technology back then was unreadable...

559 2018-05-09 23:00:17 @PremierofNL will take credit for a balanced budget next year because oil went up due to the break in the US-Iran deal.
560 2018-05-09 23:00:17 Still won't be as high as when the cap is removed. The coal fired power plants were keeping costs low. Sad to see them go. I understand why they are being decommissioned for health and greenwashing the oil industry but we will pay big time soon enough. As we always do sadly.
561 2018-05-09 23:00:06 How do people without helpful dads or boyfriends ever remember to do an oil change?!
562 2018-05-09 23:00:04 確かに？？人気出そうなフレーバーの組み合わせ。
563 2018-05-09 23:00:00 Pipelines are the safest and most environmentally friendly way to transport oil and natural gas! #WednesdayWisdom
564 2018-05-09 22:59:55 I appreciate your views, but please don’t label “tar sands”. The left bites on to that with every negative known. They are the Fort MacMurrey OIL SANDS. Thank you.
565 2018-05-09 22:59:54 Don’t like oil price up 

Fix it please 

And don’t go to North Korea
566 2018-05-09 22:59:42 Not to mention no one will hire her in the future. If we held our politicians to the same standards we wouldn't have half of the racist spew and twice the harmony.
567 2018-05-09 22:59:30 If oil keeps reacting like this it is likely coming soon. Specific mentions from the Treasury that oil shouldn’t go higher. Right at the start of US driving season
568 2018-05-09 22:59:19 Sure, current oil prices wil most likely put upward pressure on headline inflation and expectation. But if the slowdown is persistent, there will be deflationary pressure to counter that. I just want to find out why oil is gaining so much momentum in a rising dollar environment
569 2018-05-09 22:59:17 join the club! oil and gas is quite the rollercoaster
570 2018-05-09 22:59:10 毎月10日は『植物油の日』

日本植物油協会が1994年に制定。

元々は 『710』 を180度回転させると 『OIL』 に見えるということで7月10日だけだったが、後に10=テン→テンプラ油→植物油という連想で毎月10日の記念日となった。

そうだったですね。
確かに、今日は聴きます。
574 2018-05-09 22:58:35 She wants a oil change, she want bk, she want this & that from walmart. it’s too hot sha
575 2018-05-09 22:58:35 my car's maintenance required light has been flashing for a few weeks now and i knew that meant it was about time for an oil change but it came on and stayed on in the middle of my driving today and i about dissociated in the middle of sun valley lmao

577 2018-05-09 22:58:28 My prediction for this summer:
Griezmann, Arthur, De Ligt, pre-deal with De Jong for next year. 
Cules expecting Thiago, Eriksen, Verrati are gonna get massively disappointed. 
Board doesn't have oil money to spend.
578 2018-05-09 22:58:26 tell her to try some oil pulling or candling
579 2018-05-09 22:58:25 The US purchases oil from Canada, South America, and uses our own reserves. We don't buy oil from OPEC, genius.
580 2018-05-09 22:58:18 No problem, plenty of oil in the ground right here in North Dakota!
581 2018-05-09 22:58:07 Puzzle it out and make up your own mind, all you’re asking me for is my answer to that thought process, and I’m telling you that I’m not compelled to show you my work. Good luck forming your own opinion. As opinions go, “is palm oil a vegan or environmental issue” is low stakes.
582 2018-05-09 22:57:58 Unrelated, but have you ever heard the term "Daddy's money lesbian"?
583 2018-05-09 22:57:56 Tfw the oil money is soooo good.
584 2018-05-09 22:57:54 So the washed up one-hit-wonder from AB apparently doesn't know a thing about AB.
It's the OIL sands, sweetheart. AB's oil sector spends the most out of any other AB industry on HELPING the environment. You'd rather we buy oil from Saudi, Venezuela, etc than fund our families?
585 2018-05-09 22:57:41 No surprise. Netanyahu got Trump to pull out of the Iran deal to create Middle Eastern instability. Why? Putin needs the oil prices to increase to prop up his failed economy.
586 2018-05-09 22:57:34 I’m getting my oil changed and i’m just waiting for them to come in here and tell me that there’s a trillion things wrong with my car

588 2018-05-09 22:57:15 Hmm, chickpeas toasted on a skillet with olive oil, butter, sea salt, cayenne, black pepper and cumin are a pretty easy and tasty snack

590 2018-05-09 22:56:51 Saudis can't wait to step in and make up the oil shortfall
591 2018-05-09 22:56:37 Under W gas was almost 5 dollars a gallon because of a BS war in Iraq. Only a global economic collapse could get price of oil back down. That's what they do
592 2018-05-09 22:56:35 Rupert Murdoch on his massive investment in Golan Heights (Syria) oil mining.

“If Genie Energy's effort to develop shale oil is successful, then the news we’ll report (from the Middle East) in coming decades will reflect a more prosperous, more democratic, and more secure world"
593 2018-05-09 22:56:31 Lots of the oil owning elite will be ecstatic....Wonder how long before retail prices go up...
594 2018-05-09 22:56:24 to what, RED, cause he's certainly BLUE...  HA!!
595 2018-05-09 22:56:17 Also didn’t help that Rex was a snake oil salesmen who said he would guarantee a Jets SB
596 2018-05-09 22:56:03 Go for grassfed ghee and MCT oil
597 2018-05-09 22:55:42 And everybody wondered what Jared & Mohammed bin Salman stayed up all night talking about- probably it was kill the Iran agreement, get the oil prices up, and there’ll be money in it for everybody!
598 2018-05-09 22:55:23 Would it be better to continue fracking for oil in the U.S. rather than continue our *very expensive* alliance with Saudi Arabia?  I dunno.  Flip a coin.  I'll bet it really frosted the Saudis that the U.S. didn't go in and invade Syria for them.
599 2018-05-09 22:55:06 If I can’t put baby oil on ya butt .... Guuuuuuuurl I HATE YOU!
600 2018-05-09 22:55:02 I'm pretty sure he was never really a comedian
601 2018-05-09 22:54:38 Fins and tech bouncing nice. Oil is a beast.
602 2018-05-09 22:54:37 In some cities people are already breaking into restaurants to steal used oil.
603 2018-05-09 22:54:19 I’d like to point out that the industry itself used to call it “tar sands.” My auntie gave me a key chain with actual tar sands in it when I was a kid. It was from an energy company. Oil sands is a PR term that was created to make it seem less “dirty.” The more you know. 
604 2018-05-09 22:54:15 What do wild horses have to do with Oil sands then if that is the case? From a very disappointed ex fan
605 2018-05-09 22:54:11 Go find some CBD oil somewhere. It’s $20-30 a bottle for at least 25 doses. It’s worked wonders for my periods and for my back problems. Plus it helps with my anxiety and depression. Text me if you do go and I can give you advice on how much to take/when.
606 2018-05-09 22:53:59 Damn. I closed out on 20% of my oil hedge today.
607 2018-05-09 22:53:55 Another oil (olive?) would probably work in combo with some doggy shampoo
608 2018-05-09 22:53:51 Also Russia made bank from their own oil prices going up....
609 2018-05-09 22:53:51 Hello. Kelantan need their oil royalty now. #NewMalaysia they said.
610 2018-05-09 22:53:50 I guess the 110,000 unemployed people in the oil patch mean nothing in all of this
611 2018-05-09 22:53:44 im so geeked i found the perfect oil for my hair
612 2018-05-09 22:53:38 And with that one tweet you display your ignorance of the scientific method. Consensus is the safe harbor of those who prescribe to the precautionary principle, a progress-choking mindset of snake oil salesmen.
613 2018-05-09 22:53:37 This is true. Further sanctions will have a huge impact on oil and gas economy. This is a destabilizing factor as well. However in my opinion the nuclear aspect is most important. If this gets out of control-and at the moment unfortunately it seems to be so- then the risk of... 1

616 2018-05-09 22:53:10 @EPAScottPruitt go suck exon Mobil, Tyson chicken, pig f##ker corp., shell oil penis, BP BALLS & dick oil, genitalia you cowardly little f##k! You really need that security, don't you? For your peace of mind. Because of ur guilty mind!
617 2018-05-09 22:52:57 Agreed except the Iranian-supported Houthis are terrorists, not rebels. They fire ballistic missiles into heavily-populated cities, fire anti-ship missiles at oil tankers and shell marketplaces in Yemen. Iran is a terrorist state responsible for fueling many regional conflicts.
618 2018-05-09 22:52:53 Aussie shares are set to open firmer again today as shares rallied on Wall St as surging oil prices boosted energy stocks and investors returned to the market. #DailyMarketUpdate #ausbiz

621 2018-05-09 22:51:46 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
622 2018-05-09 22:51:37 This is a crude oil delivery from the US to China.
623 2018-05-09 22:51:13 The oil companies  love ANY reason to raise prices. This one is a hum dinger. Higher prices for years. #ThanksTrump
624 2018-05-09 22:51:11 I hope Lexis pulling up I need her to put this oil on my scalp
625 2018-05-09 22:51:05 i chose oil so I can run a generator (not to mine bitcoin LOL)
626 2018-05-09 22:51:05 I believe producing and exporting mass amounts of oil is good for everyday Americans. It strengthens our economy. it creates good jobs.  The ability to produce the oil does INDEED lessen our reliance on foreign nations.
627 2018-05-09 22:51:03 @realDonaldTrump The increase in oil prices and now gas prices has wiped out on an annualized basis any benefit from tax cuts. Can someone address this. PLEASE!!
628 2018-05-09 22:50:58 プラチナからですか？
629 2018-05-09 22:50:52 I got Moroccan oil yesterday to help with my curls and she didn’t come to play. My curls are , my hair smells Good™, and I’m fully rested.
630 2018-05-09 22:50:49 Yessss so much and I’ll let it soak overnight w peppermint essential oil mixed w the oils on my scalp to promote hair growth and then the oils all throughout then I’ll wash it out in the morning it makes ur hair so nice
631 2018-05-09 22:50:47 @realDonaldTrump    
  All the people who come on tv and talk diplomacy about iran are lairs even Hilary wants you to take the oil but will never say it, you take that oil and America will be great again the only person who does not want you to take the oil Is obama
632 2018-05-09 22:50:31 Trust shitty Chelsea to mess it all up. Shit club no history. Bought their success with oil money
633 2018-05-09 22:50:24 Big oil companies did this too.
634 2018-05-09 22:50:06 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
635 2018-05-09 22:49:45 My favorite part about getting an oil change is the free popcorn they have at the dealership
636 2018-05-09 22:49:45 He your facts straight . The us is mandated by law not the o export crude oil . We haven’t done it in 40 years except for 1 ship to South Korea
637 2018-05-09 22:49:34 Front page of @DRUDGE_REPORT right now:

"Saudis to seek nukes if Iran does"

"Intercept missiles over Riyadh"

"Oil soars"

"Air raid sirens Israel; IDF: Iranian Forces Fire Rockets"

... it's starting to smell like a global shit-show.
638 2018-05-09 22:49:25 At some point, a job is a job. Also, if you see anybody outta work in West Texas right now. It’s because THEY don’t want to work. Oil booming for a solid 3 more years. Be excuses.
639 2018-05-09 22:49:16 Republicans hate any other energy source that's not oil or coal , you know like the good ol times.
640 2018-05-09 22:49:13 at least now we have a spark of hope that Malaysia can be great again with reduced killing rate,oil price not being fluctuated,less corruption, and something where we can be proud to be called Malaysians once more

642 2018-05-09 22:49:04 I'm torn too. Maybe because I have kids. I don't think her life should be ruined. She just needs learn she was wrong.
643 2018-05-09 22:48:57 I really hate coconut oil on the low 
644 2018-05-09 22:48:47 I should probably bathe in it as well as ingest it lol. But will add some to my coconut oil I use on my skin
645 2018-05-09 22:48:45 I do not like the smell of this new hair oil at all and now I can’t escape the smell

648 2018-05-09 22:48:37 All my friends who were laid off and opted to stay in the province after the oil price crash are all working. It is not all doom and gloom in our part of the country. Thanks to the work of the Premier and the @albertaNDP government things are looking up.
649 2018-05-09 22:48:37 Give me the tanning oil...
650 2018-05-09 22:48:33 Yes, but as a foodie and author of foods, has coconut oil taken the place of any butter in your kitchen? Honest question.
651 2018-05-09 22:48:27 Oh my god when the guy who changed my oil today was like going over everything with me I farted so loud and I swear to god there was a solid 10 seconds of silence after. Why am I who I am  #killmenow
652 2018-05-09 22:48:25 We both know irrefutable proof either way is not possible or we would all be believers or atheists. I get that some really crap stuff gets said and done by some Christians; I ask you to trust that I’m not way. I wouldn’t buy snake oil and I don’t sell it either.
653 2018-05-09 22:48:25 Fracing is what has given us oil deposit . Natural gas is what we are exporting . We haven’t exported oil in 40 years .. we have a ban on it .. one ship to South Korea   7 million barrels  wooppee
654 2018-05-09 22:48:16 There's sadly dudes out there that don't.
They don't check tires, antifreeze, oil, or nothing. Shit is tragic.
655 2018-05-09 22:48:15 It's been 1,000 days since the BP oil spill and the Gulf of Mexico still has not been restored.

658 2018-05-09 22:48:13 It would be interesting to find out how Canada's oil industry will react to the Iran deal. They are probably jubiliant.
659 2018-05-09 22:48:08 @LunaLuvgood2017 @guardian 
Trump is doing everything he can to bring down America. Conspiraters want War. Money. Oil. USA.
660 2018-05-09 22:48:05 Avoid the Bell'Angelo store on @amazon. I bought a Wahl 5 Star Senior hair clipper from them and they sent it in a new box but inside was a used clipper with hair and clipper oil all over it, with no booklets or accessories in the box. Disgusting and completely unacceptable.
661 2018-05-09 22:48:01 . I was putting oil in the pot and it was the first thought I got.
662 2018-05-09 22:47:58 Stocks ending with solid gains as oil soars, which is boosting energy Stocks and the broader market. Dow +183 points at the close.
663 2018-05-09 22:47:24 Water and oil do not mix. You don't dump oil into a pond.  I'm tempted to knock on all the damn doors to find out who it was, not like anyone would fess up to being the douche #ifuckinghatepeople #weneedrain #InCaseYouWerentAware
664 2018-05-09 22:47:18 Tell me how Obama made it worse and tell me how Trump has fixed it. Now he has cost farmers 19billion. He has added 2 trillion to debt in 14 months. He is pulling out of trade deals that would create American jobs. The latest he just cost jobs at Boeing and raised oil prices.
665 2018-05-09 22:47:13 Thanks reading now
As of 2015, Israel consumes 270,000 barrels of oil per day
This should not be happening imo, I hope this gets returned to the rightful owners one day.
666 2018-05-09 22:47:06 Awesome what you and team pulled off there, @j66anderson.
Stay safe and alert on the road, will be rooting for you. Go show um what hard work and determination can accomplish.
GO #underdogs!
667 2018-05-09 22:47:05 I understand the argument, but hate the rationale. Just another way to jack up prices for oil that had  already been promised/purchased at cheaper rates. #gasface
668 2018-05-09 22:47:03 Oil Hits $77 but Ant Rial Tumbles After Trump Quits Nuclear Deal - Business Live
669 2018-05-09 22:46:58 Iran has light crude oil. It’s the best. Easy to crack. This is insane what he has done.
670 2018-05-09 22:46:56 Oil man, no oil for miles... he's a CPA. Educate yourself man or maybe u two have some prejudices to resolve
671 2018-05-09 22:46:52 I just bought a cool new Samsung Galaxy SG Nuclear power is making dolphins violent! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal! The government could build hoverbuses if they wanted to, BUT THEY DON’T WANT TO!
672 2018-05-09 22:46:41 The us hasn’t exported oil in 40 years   1 load to South Korea this year .  We still have a ban on exporting oil by the way .    We get most of our oil from Canada
673 2018-05-09 22:46:40 See my life,distance won't allow me take part in this challenge and win my oil in peace 
674 2018-05-09 22:46:39 Oil at $70 means consumer spending goes down dimwits
675 2018-05-09 22:46:35 You're from Connecticut where gas rose about 15 cents. And this would've happened either way because it's summer. Russia exports gas and wheat. They're not a leading supplier in oil.
676 2018-05-09 22:46:28 “You’d just sit in the room after smoking your pipe and would blast beds are burning by midnight oil like it’s the 80’s again.” 

I’m my wcw
677 2018-05-09 22:46:15 Pulling out of the Iran Deal directly contradicts the concept of "defending" the oil and America has been directly or indirectly funding radical Islamists for decades.
678 2018-05-09 22:45:57 Massage oil?
679 2018-05-09 22:45:47 Hit a small patch with brake cleaner. It’s about as light an oil as you can get. This shit is so gummy that it breaks down but just pushes around and smears. Took me 20 min’s doing about 6sq”.
680 2018-05-09 22:45:41 What other billionaires profit from fossil fuels? Who? Who? I think the name begins with a “K”and ends with a “h.” Follow the oil drops....
681 2018-05-09 22:45:33 Jajajajajaja! Yo me vine a la OIL a tomar un café y está lleno de bosteros... No vaya a ser que haga un gol Gimnasia, se los grito y salgo corriendo...
682 2018-05-09 22:45:31 If oil prices keep rising, there's always a risk of stagflation. I'm not convinced oil prices can sustain these high proves either, but that doesn't mean we can ignore that scenario.
683 2018-05-09 22:45:31 A Summer Mood:

A few minutes of a hot shower & then turning it as cold as your body can take.
Moisturizing your whole body with shea & oatmeal lotion, coconut oil for the hair.
Window open, lavender candles lit, fan on high, cool air blowing over you.
684 2018-05-09 22:45:17 Oh please, Iran is one of  Russia's allies. Oil price jumped because DT pulled out of the treaty period
685 2018-05-09 22:45:11 How much revenue did UK get from oil last year?

687 2018-05-09 22:44:57 @realDonaldTrump what's up with oil prices.. always 1 step forward 2 steps back in this Country. Get taxes and econony rolling, put little extra in peoples pockets and price jumps on something that people end up spending more than they were before they got a little break
688 2018-05-09 22:44:56 I think you're wrong here. New sanctions on Iran could decrease the world oil supply, making oil futures scared, raising prices. Luckily, Pres Trump opened Anwar so we can make up the difference. American frackers will seize the opportunity and increase supply. MAGA!
689 2018-05-09 22:44:49 Wait. "Oil mining"?

"Just 2 drops of this liquid "clove oil" in each ear and I  swear it will take that earache away in a minute" .. To this day I can't eat any ham with cloves stuck in it !
694 2018-05-09 22:44:33 My radishes taste like a french fry browned in sweet oil sprinkled with black pepper. Consistency is like a ripe slice of apple 
695 2018-05-09 22:44:29 You are so so intensely unbright. Russia is Iran’s biggest and ally and, along with NoKo their biggest nuclear and arms materiel suppliers. Cutting the legs out from underneath Iran hurts Putin. Big time. USA can always ramp up oil output - benefiting us and hurting Russia Bonus
696 2018-05-09 22:44:22 President Fat Donnie in his never ending battle to destroy things that work just because Obama put them in place has torn up the Iran agreement. Ramping up trouble in the Middle East and paving the way for his friends in the oil business to jack up gas prices & make billions.
697 2018-05-09 22:44:05 Master political opperative being asked questions by the f**k face Snake Oil Salesman. The latest news is that investment in oil and gas is increasing in Alberta because of the rise in the resource stock price. The economy of the province is improving monthly.

700 2018-05-09 22:43:37 Iran deal was all about Monies - not security.  Big business for countries in the deal - & Iran exporting oil collecting $s to build nuclear weapons.  Merkel will be first one to request help if Germany threatened by Iran down the road.

707 2018-05-09 22:42:54 How much Monistat do you mix with the hair growth oil?
708 2018-05-09 22:42:52 JCPOA by Obama and P5+1 lightened Iran's sanction made regime regain its asset worth $100,000 billion that was frozen abroad also selling oil for goods. Before deal Iran lost more than $100,000 billion unable to sell oil. With or without deal regime spreads its clout in region.
709 2018-05-09 22:42:30 now I can see why you are not carrying them with you..) mine 'everyday pack' fit into the big cosmetics bag. it's one dildo, one harness, one butt plug, womanizer, 2-3 different bottles of lube, massage oil, condoms, dental dams and some lingerie
710 2018-05-09 22:42:29 Oil is above $70 per barrel and my pipeline investments are really kicking into gear. I love that affordable, reliable, and abundant energy source.
711 2018-05-09 22:42:22 Guess #Oil hits $90 long b4 Firecracker Holiday - fill up ur tank if u got a combustible petro fired mode of transport while it's still cheap
712 2018-05-09 22:42:21 Not just oil, its hydrogenated vegetable oil.
713 2018-05-09 22:42:15 CBD oil can be very helpful for nonverbal autism and the autism spectrum disorder. I hope this mother has heard of it. If she lives in Colorado, she can ask her doctor to prescribe it.
714 2018-05-09 22:42:10 Yup and another possibility with the Iran treaty is with oil prices bound to rise, guess what country stands to benefits “BIGLY”?!   RUSSIA!
715 2018-05-09 22:42:07 Hi @IDFSpokesperson, are all those wounded Al Qaeda terrorists from Syria that Israel treated in its hospitals now defending Golan Heights? Don't forget, Rupert Murdoch and Dick Cheney's #GenieEnergy is under threat from Iran rockets. Deploy More Al Qaeda To Defend their oil.
716 2018-05-09 22:42:00 Wow, Donny @realDonaldTrump, and don’t forget to mention Putin’s glee at resulting rising oil prices.

719 2018-05-09 22:41:40 Has anyone done chad Bacon grease vs extra virgin olive oil?
720 2018-05-09 22:41:39 Go all in,  ask for cheese, biscuit, cold meats, hummus, balsamic vinegar, some good olive oil, strawberry’s, and 
721 2018-05-09 22:41:31 He can’t remember something he never knew or learned, Will.
722 2018-05-09 22:41:21 Don't forget, he' playing Putin's playbook.  This gives Russia more money when oil goes up.  Don't forget it.
723 2018-05-09 22:41:15 Need a stick blender. 1 cup olive oil, drop in an egg and let settle. Add dijon mustard, some lemon juice and/or apple cider vinegar, salt pepper etc. Blend without moving stick blender about 20-30 secs, then grad draw blender up to get last bits of oil
724 2018-05-09 22:41:01 Yeah the rose water I use it purely as a toner and for the tea tree I put in two drops on two drops of olive oil/almond oil on a cotton pad and moisturize
725 2018-05-09 22:40:38 Would love to try this I’ve had such success with your essence and daily reviving oil

729 2018-05-09 22:40:22 I wonder how high oil prices will go...
730 2018-05-09 22:40:17 self care night routine:

•wash thy hair 
•hop out and out on a hair mask
• take off your makeup girl (I like to use coconut oil)
• apply a gentle facial cleanser 
• FACE MASK TIME
• get in a bath to let your hair/face mask set 
• shave - sugar scrub - shave 
• rinse off!
731 2018-05-09 22:40:15 high probability of trade deals between USA and China/Europe....then the stock markets have a good move....Iran moves oil...
732 2018-05-09 22:40:11 知ってる？スーパーってタダで牛脂くれるんだよ。
733 2018-05-09 22:40:03 Where has prices of oil actually risen by 1$ lol
734 2018-05-09 22:39:57 You are either a dumb MF’er or just lazy. Keep beating the Brazil drum after checking their last month production numbers that PBR was too ashamed of to even post themselves. They also just confirmed that their FPSOs are going to be late on first oil. Growth might be negative.
735 2018-05-09 22:39:53 Had no idea, don’t care either!
736 2018-05-09 22:39:43 Two coal powered electricity plants in Georgia USA create more carbon gas emissions than all of Fort McMurray. Wake up Jann our economy depends on us getting our land locked oil to market. Your comments are perception not reality!!
737 2018-05-09 22:39:41 Trump and Israel are going to level the Middle East and take the oil
738 2018-05-09 22:39:40 Trump pulls Iranian deal (that Iran was apparently complying with)...Iran fires missiles at Israel...Israel will likely respond...Oil prices increase ...gasoline goes up $.60/gallon...at a time when things were calm, Trump stirs the pot...leadership
739 2018-05-09 22:39:21 ROFL thank you for the wonderful chuckle ! Harper de-listed 1000's or lakes, rivers, streams, so the oil companies could dump their toxic shit into them.  CON's have never been nor will be concerned about environment! He tried to have protesters declared domestic terrorist!
740 2018-05-09 22:39:18 $fb $amzn $aapl $googl $nflx are back we are going to all time highs oil will drive this rally.
741 2018-05-09 22:39:10 2.10- 2.19 I live where we have oil (pumping stations)everywhere. It made it to $3.00 here.I do see it rising to 80 to 85 a barrel last night bloomberg had it @ 70 a decline checked Bloomberg 71.20 energy is on the Rise.Which means higher bill.living in the south it hurts.
742 2018-05-09 22:38:52 Trump's action raises the risk of conflict in the Middle East and and it definitely casts uncertainty over oil supplies in an already tight market.
743 2018-05-09 22:38:49 President Donald Trump pulling out of the deal with Iran will see an increase in the price of global oil prices. Counties like Nigeria will benefit from it.
744 2018-05-09 22:38:44 I will predict today tha oil prices will skyrocket and Russia will get rich because of the Iran deal. I will bet the clothes off my back.
745 2018-05-09 22:38:37 EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD KNOW WHY GAS JUMPED $1
bc DT tore up Iran deal to appease Putin's oil based economy
so Putin wouldn't rat that DT conspired with him to defraud the United States
So the extra $12-30 you're paying 
for each fill up?

That's to keep the Russian happy.
746 2018-05-09 22:38:26 @SenJoniErnst @SenJoniErnst @ChuckGrassley Thank you for supporting @realDonaldTrump agenda. He backed out of Iran deal &;Gas prices will now rise as all of your oil exec friends get richer. China is no longer buying US soybeans. You should be ashamed.
747 2018-05-09 22:38:26 Vitruvi!! So good, their diffuser is beautiful and I love their oil blends
748 2018-05-09 22:38:15 I guess your new friends, the Saudi’s, are pretty satisfied now when they get their money back as a result of rising oil prices.
749 2018-05-09 22:38:08 It’s about money, oil money. When Iran can’t export Saudi Arabia wins.

751 2018-05-09 22:37:57 definitely agree that the 10YR needs to fall to cause DXY to sell-off..the 20 day correlation between the two is now is 0.73 which is by far the highest its been this year. I think the 10 years been helped a lot by oil's strength as well. I think the 10 Yr is due for a PB though

755 2018-05-09 22:37:46 @SuaveBeauty YOUR NEW ARGAN OIL DRY SHAMPOO IS WAY TOO SCENTED AND ATTRACTS BEES PLS ADVISE

757 2018-05-09 22:37:35 Just saw the video of that lady at a Denny’s being racist in Alberta. I think I speak for all of Canada when I say hey @POTUS we will trade you Alberta for Hawaii. They have oil! Think on that for a day or 2.
758 2018-05-09 22:37:28 I do really like a lot of the oil paintings i saw and i found i really love monet

761 2018-05-09 22:36:48 Tea tree oil every night
762 2018-05-09 22:36:48 Shouldn't all Murdoch @NewsCorp and @21CF news media be disclosing right now that their owner @RupertMurdoch has a huge financial investment in oil mining in Golan Heights? Now threatened by Iran?

NewsCorp and Fox News are calling for War to protect Rupert's $$$$ #GenieEnergy
763 2018-05-09 22:36:48 Dropped my car off for an oil change, got hit with a $3,000+ estimate for "other things".

765 2018-05-09 22:36:46 Ear blocked so put olive oil in mah ear canal, and accidentally got hot oil ALL OVER mah face...
Great
766 2018-05-09 22:36:34 Brought to you by Oil and Gas.
767 2018-05-09 22:36:31 Yeah if you put grease or cooking oil in the carton, then apparently it goes in the green bin. Ottawa has very ambiguous info on this.
768 2018-05-09 22:36:27 Yep, my Sudanese friend said the same thing about Sudan. But it turns out that a man who sanctions the razing of villages, buys oil from ISIS and promotes Islamism, is an arsehole and probably has a shitty moustache
769 2018-05-09 22:36:20 I love when my mom borrows my car. She always gets an oil change, car wash & fills my tank up.
770 2018-05-09 22:36:15 "The state recently issued a wetlands activity permit to Fort Worth, Texas-based Burnett Oil Co. Inc. for the survey that would cover 110 square miles within the preserve." via @CBS July 25, 2015
771 2018-05-09 22:36:04 No avocados- oil. No olives. No deli meat- preservatives and sugar. Yes, it’s rough... lol
772 2018-05-09 22:35:46 That great if you got oil stocks and you don’t drive 
773 2018-05-09 22:35:40 Trump is doing bidding of zkremlin and Koch Brothers It’s got something to do with oil as usual Trump isn’t the Master Ask  King wanna be Charles & David Koch. Putin is  a Russian mafia thug he just kills you with nuclear toxins He must have worshipped Roy Cohn and  Al Capone.
774 2018-05-09 22:35:37 The put/call ratio on the USO oil ETF has risen sharply. The ratio rose over 6 on Monday and crude rose almost $3 today. The rally in price did not deter the bears. The put/call ratio rose over 5 today. This is the type of sentiment that will take oil up further.
775 2018-05-09 22:35:34 Well said Libtard....let’s have a terrorist party while buying foreign oil
776 2018-05-09 22:35:34 Damn bro 3 oil changes?  Sounds like a Nissan
777 2018-05-09 22:35:30 ไม่ใช่แค่บรรยากาศที่เปลี่ยนไป แต่จังหวะการเต้นของหัวใจก็เหมือนกัน
778 2018-05-09 22:35:30 Oil surged past $71 for the first time since 2014 as American stockpiles shrank and the U.S. told buyers they have six months to curb their purchases from Iran.

781 2018-05-09 22:35:16 The Strategic Advisory Board of Genie Oil and Gas greenlights hotel construction plans and buys weapons stock.
782 2018-05-09 22:35:13 You forgot 1. Gave Putin & his crime family a windfall as oil prices will rise benefitting RU economy, 2. Furthered Putin’s public goal of driving a wedge between  USA and EU. 3. Benefitted certain US cos that sell arms to Arab states as mid east is destabilized. Winning?
783 2018-05-09 22:35:13 Also developing our own fossil fuels so not dependent on Iran. But Saudi will get the oil flowing if need be.
784 2018-05-09 22:35:10 *creeeeeeeeeeak* I need me some oil
785 2018-05-09 22:35:00 @RitaSofiale olive oil nice polish sausage
786 2018-05-09 22:34:42 Productive evening.  Changed the oil on the van and the crew cab and still plenty of time left.
787 2018-05-09 22:34:40 Do you have a chart of industry contribution to overall default risk? Presumably oil would have been a big piece affecting overall rating change a few years ago(?)
788 2018-05-09 22:34:30 I been trying to change this nigga Stevens oil for weeks now and honestly Im not gonna feel bad when it's black
789 2018-05-09 22:34:27 "Gas prices could go up due to Iran withdrawal."

2018: We buy little oil from Iran so it doesn't matter. The president doesn't control gas prices so there are other factors at work.

2013: Why does Obama hate America? If he wasn't so stupid we'd have 99 cent gas. Impeach now!!!
790 2018-05-09 22:34:18 I am HOOKED on The Ordinary skincare products. The Rose Hip Seed oil is gorgeous. My skin is glowing.
791 2018-05-09 22:34:17 also Oil Prices.  total coincidence.
792 2018-05-09 22:33:59 Have a headache? Just smother peppermint oil on your face and your eyes will start burning making you forget you even had a headache 

793 2018-05-09 22:33:57 Gotta love the oil price going up up up!
794 2018-05-09 22:33:49 I might cook the banana in the left over oil from the Thai rice and give him half as he gave me the banana for breaky
795 2018-05-09 22:33:46 Thank you, but save some prayer for yourself ma'm. You need it far more than i, if youve been fooled by the trumpian snake oil.
796 2018-05-09 22:33:37 I am a happy gal rn, I have my face covered in rosehip oil & I ate gooood
797 2018-05-09 22:33:28 There’s a special place in hell for you. All over Alberta, children don’t get enough to eat, don’t get to play organized sports and have divorced parents as a result of oil jobs being destroyed by eco-terrorists. Digusting people, ruining families.
798 2018-05-09 22:33:24 All y’all Baws, that’s an @TigerDroppings term (don’t blame me). Seems you may be paying full price for your #F150.  Damn, who can afford a #FordNation truck at full price. Oil prices are up, I’m guessing those Baw’s are buying #F250’s.
799 2018-05-09 22:33:12 For two months prior to Trump announcement, Saudi Arabia, to the astonishment of traders, was actually RAISING the price of oil to China, one of their largest customers....think about that ....this is not just about oil
800 2018-05-09 22:33:10 sure, I have deep in the money puts 12 months out on sp500, dow 30, along with spxu sdow....plus 2 yr leap on uso puts along with dwt since early january...have not sold any since I bought..,,,added more dwt recently...will add little more if oil goes higher...
801 2018-05-09 22:33:07 I think the value of foreign assets was around $100bn, & Iran lost about $25bn a year oil sales. Somewhere around there, still significant money. Sanctions basically boxed Iran in.
802 2018-05-09 22:32:59 Acceleration 100% due to sanctions. You, like many, missed the impact of cutting PDVSA off from global capital markets. Look at a chart of production and when sanctions took effect. Decline rate doubled nearly instantly. They would be recovering now, w/oil, if not for sanctions
803 2018-05-09 22:32:54 I deduced oil prices would rise because of instability in areas of production. To hedge against higher prices at the pumps and to make money, I bought a triple leveraged up ETF (risky) that tracks Bloomberg WTI. If none of this makes sense and you're over 30, we have to talk.
804 2018-05-09 22:32:53 My only issue is I don’t actually like hot piña.  But that sounds fire. I doctor up my with garlic sautéed in their sesame oil, diced onion + diced orange slices, fish sauce + soy sauce. It’s perfection.
805 2018-05-09 22:32:52 Put some coconut oil on it. 
806 2018-05-09 22:32:42 If it's true Iran is "firing rockets from Syria into Golan Heights border region" Dick Cheney and Rupert Murdoch's mega-millions investment in Genie Energy (oil mining) could be under threat.

Expect Murdoch media to go utterly ballistic on Iran. Most of his editors want More War
807 2018-05-09 22:32:09 So far all I needed was an oil change and new front and back breaks and a new tire lol I’ve spent no more than $300
808 2018-05-09 22:32:04 You forgot about the other oil, but I guess the end result is the same.
809 2018-05-09 22:32:02 I'm almost in the office alone, and I'm nowhere near finished for the day. SMH.
On another note, discussing oil on Power 106 at 9:30 tomorrow morning, Lord willing. Tune in, will you!?
810 2018-05-09 22:31:36 @MSNBC first time giving The Beat a watch - you're turning into SNL, nothing but a beat on Trump, is this whole show tonight on cohen, etc?  what about noko freeing Americans? iran pull out and impact on oil
811 2018-05-09 22:31:33 TZ, the Govt issues three-day ultimatum to cooking oil ‘hoarders’ to bring product to market
812 2018-05-09 22:31:20 4 LITRES OF ENGINE OIL HAS SPILLED IN MY CAR BACK TOMORROW TO SAY THE LEAST
813 2018-05-09 22:31:08 That's where I draw the line for suspension of disbelief: Armageddon.

I can suspend my disbelief enough to accept that a desperate NASA would send unqualified oil drillers into space on 30 days notice to save the world from an asteroid with no back-up plan. That's my limitation.
814 2018-05-09 22:31:02 Hint: Summer break. Oil always goes up this time of year.
815 2018-05-09 22:31:00 price and time corrections are healthy and happen in good markets my 3000-3200 price target is still what i am looking for    assumeing oil doesnt go much higher
816 2018-05-09 22:30:54  I just use nogzema or any face mask. I used to do it everyday but I haven’t recently. I put baby oil on my skin everytime I shower though lol
817 2018-05-09 22:30:52 They tried to sell me a $300 package, I was there for my free oil change.

821 2018-05-09 22:30:01 Is this all about raising oil prices? Surely has to have some pocket value.
822 2018-05-09 22:29:53 The mulahs of iran are funding the houti rebels in Yemen while firing rockets at the Saudis. That's what's driving up oil prices. Get a life
823 2018-05-09 22:29:37 Wrong oil AND wrong cardboard!!!

Unluckiest nation on earth!!!
824 2018-05-09 22:29:34 Hey Grace! Just home. I'm not expert, but this is what I know. This deal only addressed nuclear weapons development. Iran denied they were doing it, international community felt otherwise. Sanctions went into place. They froze international assets, & everyone stopped buying oil

827 2018-05-09 22:29:08 Hey @cbd_hemp_oil, Thank you for the follow!

829 2018-05-09 22:28:59 Bourbon Barrel Aged Oil of Gladness by Dark Horse Brewing Co. found at The Tipsy Cow. Gotta love it.
830 2018-05-09 22:28:57 Change your own oil even the highest end oil is only at most $10 a quart and that's pushing it
831 2018-05-09 22:28:43 Sick of white ppl talking to me about coconut oil

833 2018-05-09 22:28:33 She also suggests that we should use toners that include or are of witch hazel , apple cider vinegar, tea tree oil, rose water, bamboo extra, and lavender oil.
834 2018-05-09 22:28:32 Ah man I can smell the beach and spray tan oil from here
835 2018-05-09 22:28:26 Great article, thanks for sharing. I think this decision is going to backfire big time. Its clear that our allies are really ticked off at this especially after trying so hard to convince Trump. And I think Oil is now headed to where the Saudis want it as they have control.
836 2018-05-09 22:28:23 Oh yea where ? My friends worked in the oil and gas field in La  and have been outta work for months now
837 2018-05-09 22:28:07 Stop by my shop for an oil change or a tire lol. 5619 Rufe Snow Dr, North Richland Hills, Texas, 76180. $18 off of full and semi synthetic oil changes.

840 2018-05-09 22:28:00 Now u know how much GST & OIL PRICE HIKED are really heartbreaking. Kudos Tun M & team! Hope for a better Malaysia ahead. Amin. Bye2 #DSNajib #BN
841 2018-05-09 22:27:59 And being tough with North Korea has brought pretty good results so far. Iran’s a tough but to crack, but pressure will eventually win. Next, we need to focus on Iranian oil. It’s their only real export.
842 2018-05-09 22:27:54 Wow, big surprise that Trump pulling out of the Iran Treaty would benefit Russia and Rosneft Oil stock. I recall a big part of back channel wrangling by Carter Page had to do with bribery and a 19 billion dollar oil deal with Rosneft. Putin's bitch to the end.
843 2018-05-09 22:27:53 I have seen a movie where NASA shot a rag-tag group of oil drillers into space to blow up an asteroid and I can believe that, but I can't believe sophisticated robots that take over the world can't come up with a more efficient energy source than people. Utterly fucking braindead
844 2018-05-09 22:27:48 Weed oil... yup. Not going to ignore that lol
845 2018-05-09 22:27:45 You need more oil in your batter.
846 2018-05-09 22:27:44 no way, people are sheep and oil is cheap

850 2018-05-09 22:27:16 #IranNuclearDeal  follow the money to see who opposed pulling out. Europe -19 Billion dollar contract for planes   via Airbus.  Oil giant Total from France- 2 Billion to develop an oil field. It’s about money more than Nukes!

852 2018-05-09 22:27:11 Their record is only dismal to you because you won’t look at it through the lens of what was and what really is. After decades of PC mismanagement, global oil price drop she has had to deal with a lot.
853 2018-05-09 22:27:09 Not quite true. Without Britain Iran wouldn’t have had any oil and he tried to shaft Britain and ignore an agreement...and got removed as a result.
854 2018-05-09 22:27:07 I have yet to listen to a more nerdy Midnight Oil #podcast
855 2018-05-09 22:26:47 Please let the price of oil rise...that’s another couple of million Americans going back to work

858 2018-05-09 22:26:36 AmeRUca.  John McCain told you Russia was basically a gas station.  Trump just bumped oil over $70 which is the ONLY thing that will keep Putin in power.  Nice work @GOP.  REALLY good work PUTIN.  The American-Russian axis will not prevail.

866 2018-05-09 22:25:28 No doubt and it's a good move however until we can get rid of engines, oil is king
867 2018-05-09 22:25:14 @BNSFRailway Using tracks at Denver Union Station for short term siding of oil tanker cars is NOT a good idea. In the midst of a residential area with flammable and toxic ingredients can be a dangerous mix. Get them out as soon as possible.
868 2018-05-09 22:25:10 Nothing pisses them off. They will protect this man all the way to prison. 

They will call this an American contribution to get us off foreign oil or something.

875 2018-05-09 22:24:54 Price of oil is supposed to hold now at $71.oo for awhile. The US might need more import. If we had pipe to tidewater we could take advantage of sanctions on Iran but I guess others will take up the slack. #Carbonscam doing little for slowing CO2.

888 2018-05-09 22:23:11 Absolutely, just not overnight. 
Plenty of other stuff will need more electricity too, such as heat, heavy industry, railways, etc.
Who funds it? Consumers. Supply and demand and all that. It’ll be cheaper than paying for oil in the very near future anyway...
889 2018-05-09 22:23:10 The #FakeNews MSM doesn't know exactly what I am allowing oil to Sung Hyun Park Act,” which has done
890 2018-05-09 22:22:55 Good luck dude! Trucks looking great! 
891 2018-05-09 22:22:54 A weakening EUR relative to the USD w/higher oil prices in USD and a wider Brent-WTI split implies stagflation for *most* of the EU.
892 2018-05-09 22:22:43 Thin aluminum, bad mpg and they all leak oil.
893 2018-05-09 22:22:38 Interesting what is oil burden? XX %/GDP
894 2018-05-09 22:22:31 Trump broke the JCPOA- the contract the US made with its allies to curtail nuclear proliferation. I think those who think this makes any sense should embrace it, but they will hide in the bushes. But their oil stocks are rising! Obama got the price too low.
895 2018-05-09 22:22:28 Also, North Korea will need oil and I think sanctions will be partically lifted in the near future increasing demand.
896 2018-05-09 22:22:19 Military Industrial Complex and Oil Cartels are having an orgasm with this news. 

This will drive markets up further.

898 2018-05-09 22:21:41 Olive oil for that matter.
899 2018-05-09 22:21:39 Tax cuts were a joke unless u were a corporation or wealthy. Tax cuts r gone already, gas is $1 more than it was 1 yr ago, that’s $16 more a tank, that’s $70 a month for an average person.Trumps repeal of Iran deal made barrel skyrocket. Trump has millions n oil investment, 
900 2018-05-09 22:21:37 I’m so excited i just bought a Essential Oil’s diffuser that is also a humidifier! 
901 2018-05-09 22:21:30 Why my oil change cost 70 they use to be 19.99 lol.
902 2018-05-09 22:21:28 It's not just at the pump. Lots of things are made from hydrocarbons which come from oil. Whenever oil goes up all those things go up too. Contracts have been cancelled which is going to cost jobs. MAGA for sure. What sounds good on Foxoganda is not necessarily good in the real.
903 2018-05-09 22:21:27 Low unemployment + Tariffs + RISING gas prices = INFLATION. Watch for it, and watch out for those interest rates!

906 2018-05-09 22:20:48 So oil goes up to 70 bucks this week. But AB government is apparently still at fault for the recession. Because apparently it's over. Also companies that donr want to pay taxes or decent wages can fuck off.

You would rather we pay higher prices for gas than keep Americans working.
909 2018-05-09 22:20:38 I was shouting this from the roof top yesterday. @realDonaldTrump is Making Russian Oil Great Again. #TrumpRussia
910 2018-05-09 22:20:33 Remember folks that the crisis in #Syria is primarily about Genie Oil & Gas drilling in #GolanHeights on oil leases that #Israel had no right to sell.

The Golan is #Israeli occupied land that belongs to Syria. It is not quantum science to identify the aggressor.
911 2018-05-09 22:20:30 Anyone who repeatedly starts statements “If you’re not doing X, then...” followed by some judgment of your character, is selling snake oil. Ignore it.
912 2018-05-09 22:20:26 #oott we heard saudi arabia is going to purchase a nuke and blow up its own oil fields to get the price of oil up.  we are checking our sources stay tuned
913 2018-05-09 22:20:16 you know those oil blotting sheets people use for their faces? I need one of those for my arm pits
914 2018-05-09 22:19:36 Catch 22. If Trump has not withdrawn Saudi would have sold USA debt and it would have ushered in the end of the petrodollar. Saudi cannot compete with Iranian oil prices.  If USA economy fails the global economy fails. There was no right answer.
915 2018-05-09 22:19:34 You can promise the , the  and the . You won’t be in power in Scotland, ever. So we aren’t buying the snake oil you’re trying to sell us. We can see what you’re doing down South. An autocratic government, who haven’t got a Scooby, running headlong into  Brexit disaster
916 2018-05-09 22:19:14 WHAT A GIFT.
917 2018-05-09 22:19:09 Right? And it's just a coincidence that after yesterday's developments, oil prices are on the rise.

919 2018-05-09 22:18:54 Don't forget anything made with petro-plastic, i.e., milk, salad dressing, cooking oil, PB/jelly, soda bottles, laundry detergent, etc. Trash removal fees, landscaping fees on and on.
920 2018-05-09 22:18:50 At this rate, forget scrapping £99, Trump’s latest actions might bring it back with oil prices more than likely to rise
921 2018-05-09 22:18:44 Also allows Tillerson to go get his oil from out underneath Venezuela.
922 2018-05-09 22:18:37 So is mixing oil and water
923 2018-05-09 22:18:34 You’re confusing it’s economic prowess with their asymmetrical military actions to ensure its oil/gas deals are stabilized
924 2018-05-09 22:18:31 Any other oil rich country robbed of its resources and democracy suppressed that we know of?
925 2018-05-09 22:18:24 Nigeria. The country of oil, cocaine dealers and the fraudulent Nigeria connection. And some radical Islamic crap in the North. I'd fly by to drop some MOABs... that's it. But visit? Hell no...

930 2018-05-09 22:17:43 The price of oil rising
931 2018-05-09 22:17:38 Oil prices have soared to a 4 year high.

Fox news will create the narrative that oil is black so its Obama's fault.
932 2018-05-09 22:17:04 Oil is over $70 today. Specifically, NDP policy is to blame for companies leaving Alberta.
933 2018-05-09 22:16:52 Castor oil!!!!
934 2018-05-09 22:16:52 Oil prices high, 3 weeks after Iran decide to go with the Euro over the dollar? If you shun the petro dollar, you get punished! Libiya all over again.
935 2018-05-09 22:16:41 Much to the delight of the Russian oil businesses.
936 2018-05-09 22:16:27 the retinoic face oil is the best oil i've ever put on my face, mind you it's $50 per drop

939 2018-05-09 22:16:20 In the end, as long as the lives of Russian soldiers are guaranteed, as are it's port and oil pipelines, Russia doesn't care that much.
940 2018-05-09 22:16:20 Oil is Black. Fox news will blame it on Obama
941 2018-05-09 22:16:19 Does Trump or his family own OIL STOCK?

971 2018-05-09 22:13:05 Paul Ryan needs to quit lying. The money people are receiving from the tax cuts are going to his oil friends. Gas is once again high. Americans are not benefiting from the tax plan.
972 2018-05-09 22:12:52 'Nearing zero net oil import'? Really? How many barrels a day is that?
973 2018-05-09 22:12:26 like that is going to make oil cheaper. He'll gobble down the oil surplus for cash deals. So predictable swamp monster.
974 2018-05-09 22:12:19 Take fish oil to help prevent migraines.
Unfortunately it is not known to repel fundamentalists.
975 2018-05-09 22:12:15 I prefer "fraternity affiliated debauchery annex"
976 2018-05-09 22:12:12 Put on apricot oil, the kind found in health-food stores, to protect cuticles from turning rough and raggedy.
977 2018-05-09 22:11:53 Just how much personal stake in the oil price does the man have?  I don't know, but sometimes you have to wonder.
978 2018-05-09 22:11:49 Not even wondering why I agree? Starting in late 2006 opec starting raising oil prices! Wonder why? They didn’t want another republican. They single handily sucked all of the cash out of Americans pockets.  And made it favorably for Obama to get elected. They wanted 2 weaken USA
979 2018-05-09 22:11:47 We've also heard oil prices rising on falling dollar. Just an excuse.
980 2018-05-09 22:11:39 I work with a lady who SWEARS by castor oil! Can’t wait to see your sweet babe
981 2018-05-09 22:11:31 I hope ur not putting coconut oil on ur face queen
982 2018-05-09 22:11:30 Bruce is interchangeable with around 156 other Hollywood actresses.

984 2018-05-09 22:11:20 /2 In Alberta, oil and gas co's financed fold-out semi-trailer workshops to teach trade skills and leap frog the challenges of First Nations/aboriginal youth leaving home. NAIT-in-MOTION trailers trained about 800 ppl most of whom were instantly hired in the skilled trades. /3
985 2018-05-09 22:11:18 Honestly they already are big oil is investing heavily into green energy , at the same time our gov is still subsidizing them and taxing all of us . Great deal for the middle class eh ?
986 2018-05-09 22:11:17 Well if the owner of the dog   doesent want to use cbd hemp oil I might as well take it myself, the problem is I’ll be up all night now lol 
987 2018-05-09 22:11:15 めっちゃ喉痛い〜〜〜
988 2018-05-09 22:11:02 Ms Sanders @PressSec , you KNOW @realDonaldTrump 's decision to withdraw from the Iran deal was NOT based on actual military or security intelligence. It may speed up Iran's nuclear weapon development. 
And it WILL increase oil costs, increase turmoil and cost lives.
989 2018-05-09 22:11:01 Trump is sanctioning oil from Iran because he’s getting all the lube he needs from Russia. #makeamericarussia
990 2018-05-09 22:10:58 Russia is loving this! At the end of the day, its all about the oil.
991 2018-05-09 22:10:54 Putting rosemary oil in my scalp has done wonders but I smell so earthy
992 2018-05-09 22:10:42 Remember we learned in 2014 that USD loss of share in global oil mkts is NT USD+; may be seeing it again post CNY oil contract launch
993 2018-05-09 22:10:24 Got beard oil in my eye  my shit on fire
994 2018-05-09 22:10:23 Thank goodness it's not an oil pipeline.
995 2018-05-09 22:10:11 To keep my scalp from itching, I like to mix a little bit of tea tree oil with my favorite essential oil. I massage this into my scalp. This helps alleviate any itching and dryness. #hair #haircare #beauty #hairlife #blackgirlhair #braidspecialist #healthy #humpday #hairenvey
996 2018-05-09 22:10:10 @ImSeanO The idiots cheering are the ones who said, "Heyyyy yeah!" when Trump asked, "Why didn't we just take the oil?"
997 2018-05-09 22:10:07 これはおっぱいじゃなくて油の貯蔵庫だよ。最悪の事態の時はここから、ね。
998 2018-05-09 22:10:02 I am capitalism and the Arab Revolutions are dangerous because the region is now in a position to export both oil and revolution.
999 2018-05-09 22:10:01 Agree. Dumplings in chili oil are good. Afghan dumplings aushak are a new find and very tasty.
1000 2018-05-09 22:09:58 I’ve heard of the double cleansing but never actually tried with an oil cleanser so hopefully now i have one it’ll work :)
1001 2018-05-09 22:09:48 Thanks to the greedy self serving oil traitors.
1002 2018-05-09 22:09:47 How about #AmericaFirst @POTUS where gas prices are choking me? (California $3.69 a gallon). Let’s hoard our oil for Americans to lower expenses for middle and lower class. THEN, sell what’s leftover. @TheFive
1003 2018-05-09 22:09:39 Cutting out fizzy drinks, fruit juices and only drinking water whilst taking vitamin/fish oil tablets is a key to getting clearer skin.
1004 2018-05-09 22:09:39 Actually, the oil sands has been employing several thousands aboriginal ppl for a few decades. A key objective of the socio-economic development of oil sands was aboriginal inclusion. /2
1005 2018-05-09 22:09:35 Here's money
Ru oil reserves Rex involved in $70Trillion
Deep water
So oil prices need go up
Trump Schwartzman got 5% Rosneft oil
Hell lot $
1006 2018-05-09 22:09:32 Mine's from 2004, 140000miles, put it on a lift the other day, no signs of oil leaks anywhere, brakes are original ones.. I can't understand why people haven't caught on more to these cars. I guess ppl prefer SUVs so they can feel important (while they screw the kids planet)..
1007 2018-05-09 22:09:27 Thank you! It's spotlessly clean. I don't think it's ever been used for oil, to be honest. It'll look great alongside a vintage tin bath full of ice keeping beer bottles cool, and milk churns filled with tall flowers!
1008 2018-05-09 22:09:25 Sleep time... naked... oil... some fun with my dick 
1009 2018-05-09 22:09:21 been too long where ive not been hyped for anything zombies related. ww2 was a flop for me. so texas your making your return for bo4? all i know is the first images on the right means salt and oil someone posted an alchemy image table but ive not seen the rest in the table so
1010 2018-05-09 22:09:16 Hair moisturizer, egg yolk, olive oil and honey, then wrap, thank goodness for press and seal, and leave in for 30 minutes, let’s see how this works.
1011 2018-05-09 22:09:10 Gas prices may indeed go up, but it isn’t like it was 10 years ago. The United States is exponentially more independent when it comes to oil. You can’t let a country like Iran get away with abuse simply because it may hold you hostage via oil and nukes.
1012 2018-05-09 22:09:03 ngl coconut oil cleared up my skin a lot when i first got into skincare.
1013 2018-05-09 22:08:51 Nope still issuing injunction on Trump lava flow
1014 2018-05-09 22:08:51 We should be developing non oil based energy then this shit could not happen.
1015 2018-05-09 22:08:50 No kidding thought EIA and IEA were neutral.  When did you guys start yarning price figures?  Soon as you guys figure out what oil is shale will be in the low 50’s while Brent 100’s.  Need diesel boys.
1016 2018-05-09 22:08:43 Did you ever notice all the patches of oil in car parks? Literally every parking space! #car #oil #leaks #FixItyourcarmate
1017 2018-05-09 22:08:42 Could Senior work for BIG OIL?? Down with the plants and their colonial agenda?? The conservatives saw in plants what no one would  #woke #staysafe
1018 2018-05-09 22:08:41 Basically Chelsea became Chelsea because.of.Abramovich oil money
1019 2018-05-09 22:08:38 Sometimes I watch vulgar YouTube videos when I’m at the tire or oil place just to make people uncomfortable
1020 2018-05-09 22:08:37 Oil speculation is a threat to the economy.
1021 2018-05-09 22:08:37 I just saw a girl post on IG that she’s tanning with Olive Oil. White girls have GOT to chill lmaoooo you’re literally gonna burn ma.
1022 2018-05-09 22:08:36 @GlamLifeGuru Tati, what do we think of @thebodyshopusa products? Can you do a review video if you haven't already done? I personally love their products and home fragrance! The exotic oil for the oil burner is the best smell EVER! 
1023 2018-05-09 22:08:12 ところでこれなんてドラマ？？？？
1024 2018-05-09 22:08:04 I imagine those wall st guys Trump said he hates have made a killing hedging oil prices  and a lot of Trump’s associates made money on the inside info he was going to break the treaty. It’s so obvious but nothing will be done about it like everything else with Trump
1025 2018-05-09 22:08:02 Your oil traitors need to knock it off. Costing people more for gas, threatening the economy
1026 2018-05-09 22:08:01 Bruh i just realized I’m a whole 10,000 miles past due on a oil change in my car 
1027 2018-05-09 22:07:50 Russia too. Oil price rise is great for them as well.
1028 2018-05-09 22:07:50 Oil prices surge after Trump dumps Iran deal - Vanguard News -
1029 2018-05-09 22:07:39 The CIA has participated in the overthrow and nation building of multiple peaceful countries, turning them into brutal dictatorships.  Look up Operation Condor as a start.  Another CIA-UK joint overthrow was Operation Ajax after Iran nationalized their oil industry.
1030 2018-05-09 22:07:35 Similar in some branches of my family - they are simply more susceptible to the low sun, hi veg oil, hi carb, low ancestral fatty, nutrient-dense foods  lifestyle.

They've been sold an absolute line of sh!te, and they've paid for their belief in authority... 
1031 2018-05-09 22:07:27 So far I’ve just been using it in my coffee in the morning. Straight up - coffee + MCT oil. I haven’t tried mixing with anything as of yet.

1035 2018-05-09 22:06:52 You're so wrong and ignorant, Iran's regime is a version of ISIS with access to oil! Leftist manipulate their ppl's minds so they can keep their corrupt governments, whomever deals with such regimes would finally pay the price
1036 2018-05-09 22:06:52 As long as gas/oil stays over$60 a barrel the US can track and drill our way out, the OPEC nation's cut there price and increased there out put to squash the US fracking and export of US oil,they sit on billions of barrels of oil but have nothing to trade,they need us!

Boeing, Airbus to Lose Billions in Orders From Trump’s Iran Sanctions
1039 2018-05-09 22:06:49 Oil speculation has gone through the roof.
1040 2018-05-09 22:06:46 Critics have voiced their concern that the #Trump administration is imposing sanctions on #Iranian #oil exports so as to promote #US crude exports. #Saudis are keen to fill the gap. So will the #Russians & shale producers!
1041 2018-05-09 22:06:41 I don’t pay a car payment. Averages out to be about $250/year in maintenance (not including oil changes). For a family with two vehicles I can somewhat see why you would do this, but a single person leasing a vehicle....is insane to me for some reason
1042 2018-05-09 22:06:25 oil is not reacting...

1044 2018-05-09 22:06:09 Israel is one of the main reasons for trumps decision. However Israel doesn’t do much for us, at least Israel sold us oil. Now oil is going back up & what will Israel do for us. Nothing.
1045 2018-05-09 22:05:58 I love being able to cook. Turning 'chicken tenders' into chicken seasoned with salt, pepper, onion, garlic, and paprika and fried up in olive oil and Worcestershire sauce and have it not only NOT burn the house down but also taste damn good? Priceless.
1046 2018-05-09 22:05:50 So you knew they had baby oil...but you never thought they had baby lotion? Lol
1047 2018-05-09 22:05:50 We are not concerned with any industry's profit. We are concerned with Canada's economy. We are concerned that the work of P. Geoscientists and P. Engineers and related science and management ppl in oil sands/oil/gas/coal have been wrongly smeared by activists.
1048 2018-05-09 22:05:41 Of course it's nothing to do with the overthrow of their democratically elected government by the CIA and SIS in the 50s.. for the sake of oil
1049 2018-05-09 22:05:37 oil prices soar. trump & friends will make a lot of money. What’s next your clean coal for our autos

1055 2018-05-09 22:05:15 They’re pulling out of one region in favor of another. They’re not closing shop (especially with oil over $70 USD). And, are you suggesting KM and TCPL make pipeline FID’s that don’t make financial sense?

It’s all about the Benjamin’s baby!
1065 2018-05-09 22:04:26 Yeah Michael Moore’s piece on the Iraq war and Saddam Hussein changing his oil trading currency was eye opening.
1066 2018-05-09 22:04:15 Issa lie!
So the sardine will also be in the bowl with the cornflakes and the Suya?
Is the sardine oil still there too?
Do you add water for the cornflakes?

1069 2018-05-09 22:03:51 Well, what is the economic alternative to oil and gas?  What else do we have to sell on world markets that will draw in similar funds and create a similar economy?
1070 2018-05-09 22:03:41 Thanks Jimboman! My goal is to get better at this to do this full time, hopefully in the near future, right now I’m at the intern-stage

1075 2018-05-09 22:03:29 I guess Toyotas don't involve oil in their use and production.... Don't mind the making their ads though
1076 2018-05-09 22:03:12 But still on that, the only reason to why the US did that was to exploit South Sudan's resources esp. Crude oil or rather oil which they even started before earlier 1980s
1077 2018-05-09 22:03:11 Wally, I know you were burning the midnight oil, but you forgot to mention that Yankees fans are also the most intelligent and attractive fans, as well as the best at twitter. No hard feelings, tho. I appreciate you.

1081 2018-05-09 22:03:01 I think Clark was suggesting Bush did this for the oil. If so why didn't he take the oil after the victory in Iraq?
1082 2018-05-09 22:03:00 it's so much easier to l for new honest in the first person rather than try to get there through the back way

but I'd be lying to messed if I really believed that too be true
1083 2018-05-09 22:02:57 And tbh I wouldn’t be surprise if this just a hype to boost gold price and oil raise tension just to manipulate charts.

1088 2018-05-09 22:02:32 I'm seeing a lot of black/grey market ingestible oil products advertising total THC in MG per bottle, not per ml. It seems this leads some consumers to thinking they are using far more potent products than they are actually using.
1089 2018-05-09 22:02:31 Oil is much better for the planet than coal is
1090 2018-05-09 22:02:30 $49 for an oil change
1091 2018-05-09 22:02:26 does this means yo have houses under your oil company??? You know in Vancouver having house has more worth than having oil!!

1093 2018-05-09 22:02:11 My understanding is that nothing is to worry about NK issue. Since the “Global finance” stopped supporting Kim, he cannot develop Nukes no more. Russia and the Global finance  keep silence for rising oil price due to the Iran deal withdrawal so Mr. President won 100%.
1094 2018-05-09 22:01:57 @BreakfastNews my #shortmemory; as 18yr olds, mate & I drove my Datsun 180B from Sydney to Surfers for Summer holiday.  Played Oil’s 10 to 1 continuously until the cassette tape broke on trip home  #MidnightOil
1095 2018-05-09 22:01:46 Upon terminating Iran nuclear deal, oil prices and the stock market surged upward. Oligarchs/billionaires who bought and sold the American election for tRump will profit from bolstering the war machine. And our boys will go to war, not theirs.
1096 2018-05-09 22:01:45 Trading in the Ford F-150 ASAP. Who needs to double their monthly vehicle payment, due solely to GAS?! Never mind oil changes/maintenance @elonmusk @tesla THE WAVE OF CHANGE HAS BEGUN .. I’m sold... Tesla all the way.

1103 2018-05-09 22:01:31 I suppose the context should determine the manner of objectification, and whether or not that is harmful. I wouldn't necessarily say a Renaissance oil painting of a nude woman is misogynistic objectification.

1108 2018-05-09 22:01:20 US can cover the gap. Prices will not very dramatically. US is the highest producer of crude oil in the world right now.
1109 2018-05-09 22:01:20 “Hey mom I need $20 for gear oil”
1110 2018-05-09 22:01:13 there is a house willing to buy my oil company.
1111 2018-05-09 22:01:09 Energy stocks are ALL at 52 week highs (with few excp), including Refiners, which should be crashing.
And Iran oil was not sidelined even last sanctions, as India and SoKo never joined. But keep hyping silliness.
1112 2018-05-09 22:01:09 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, and removal.
1113 2018-05-09 22:01:04 It was their oil. Not America's not Britain's. Mossadegh was correct to nationalize it.
1114 2018-05-09 22:01:01 URGENT: Trump and Interior Secretary Zinke are rushing to open the Arctic Refuge to oil and gas drilling. Act now and stand up against any move to open the Arctic Refuge to Big Polluters!
1115 2018-05-09 22:00:58 Yea, the oil lobby is a multi-national interest run by conservatives like the Koch bros.

They're playing u.
1116 2018-05-09 22:00:57 A Gasket is  a seal between two mechanisms. The head gasket plays a vital role by sealing the combustion process so that oil and coolant do not mix. Overheating, coolant leaks, white smoke exhaust and residue on your oil dipstick can be indicators of a “blown head gasket.”
1117 2018-05-09 22:00:57 @BradSchimel thanks for taking CBD oil off the shelves you huge bag of dicks! Why don’t you try not sucking off the pharmaceutical companies. I’m glad you like dick so much, cause that blue wave is going to shove one right up you ass!
1118 2018-05-09 22:00:49 Me: So I've got this blocked ear 
Family: pour some olive oil in there
M: EUCK ! NO !

Me: So I've got this blocked ear
Pharmacist: so we'd recommend these olive oil ear drops
1119 2018-05-09 22:00:48 40 oil and 40 natural gas wells have been drilled and 49 of those have been hydraulically fractured.  There are currently 32 producing natural gas wells in the Penobsquis area as well as some oil wells in Albert County.

1121 2018-05-09 22:00:38 No war needed, All that was happened yesterday. Price of oil has already skyrocketed on the exchange. It will hit wallets probably next week.

1128 2018-05-09 22:00:16 imagine dumping ur baby into oil
1129 2018-05-09 22:00:12 The most profitable industry (until 2015) was oil and gas. Renewables are not very profitable. Onshore gas production would provide jobs, community funding and income from taxation.

1133 2018-05-09 21:59:51 GAFIRS saves the day again. It was a close call, oil on an engine can ignite. Best prevented by routine maintenance. But always have a fire action plan just in case the worst should happen.

1135 2018-05-09 21:59:49 Trump wants more war. Oil producing countries make billions during wartime. Russia has a lot of oil.
1136 2018-05-09 21:59:43 Here's the problem with @realDonaldTrump only caring about his base (ok ONE problem), he thinks we're ALL as stupid as they are and will buy the snake oil he sells them on a regular basis.  Sorry, #Spanky, not buying anything you're selling. Tick. Tock.
1137 2018-05-09 21:59:34 Gulf War Number 3

1143 2018-05-09 21:59:01 I see what u did there. Ur mom still mixing that holy oil with that Sunday rice?
1144 2018-05-09 21:59:01 Morse said the U.S. return of full sanctions on Iran would be worth about $10 per barrel to the oil price, but he said ultimately the price of oil would go down if Saudi Arabia and Russia return barrels to the market.
1145 2018-05-09 21:58:56 I believe that Assad was going to withdraw his forces from Deir Ezzor too but he waited to long. Yet others say that he withdrew from Raqqa to spare an army. I'm not so sure. Not much oil in Raqqa, but there are important water resources. I would have prefered a vicious siege tbh
1146 2018-05-09 21:58:51 The oil and gas usage per capita in the developed world has definitely fallen because of fuel efficiency and alternatives.  You’re correct that over usage is up but will peak within 10 years globally.
1147 2018-05-09 21:58:50 you left me in the dark, but I'm still here
1148 2018-05-09 21:58:38 If I have to trade off clean air for one fire every now and then I’m fine with that... also I saw a pickup truck on fire once...it wasn’t a Tesla. It happens to a lot of cars, contrary to what oil tycoons will tell you...
1149 2018-05-09 21:58:38 No but I was really smeared in oil
1150 2018-05-09 21:58:32 Lmaooo my skins isn’t clear but acne is gross it’s literally bacteria and oil so anyone who says diff is in denial
1151 2018-05-09 21:58:19 China has been the top destination for Iranian Oil. Could be yet another source  of conflict w/ the U.S.
1152 2018-05-09 21:57:45 Ah. You don't have to use that . It is more the process. Basically any soft cotton square in a plastic box with enough water to make them damp and water ever oil suits

1155 2018-05-09 21:57:40 Complained when? 2007? 2013? 100's of statements? 100's of publications repeating the same thing. He hasn't talked about that in a long time. If we were trying to take their oil why didn't we? And if so why don't we still hold it? Inquiring minds want to know
1156 2018-05-09 21:57:34 Trade wars, world economic worries, inflation, rising oil/gas prices. Possible war with Iran.  All Trump manufactured! Wake up people!
1157 2018-05-09 21:57:26 Then again I use tea tree oil for my whole existence so 
1158 2018-05-09 21:57:26 I wonder if driving up the price of oil is a motive.
1159 2018-05-09 21:57:23 Israel has been talking with Russia over the last couple of days. With the backing of the US, the Iran deal off the table and an agreement with Russia Israel has licence to do as it sees fit. Google Israeli oil interest in Syria. There's a land grab about to happen.

1161 2018-05-09 21:57:09 That’s WAY too common. There’s a guy that comes into my work at least twice a week and cannot leave without mentioning that he makes $110,000 a year doing oil changes on busses. Extremely simple work.

Thanks for the reminder that I work my ass off for a third of what you make.
1162 2018-05-09 21:57:08 My grandad uses tea tree oil on the bites and on pulse points as a repellant sometimes x
1163 2018-05-09 21:57:05 “Well excuse me officer I didn’t know I couldn’t do that…jokes on him. Because i DID know I couldn’t do that haha.” It’s a Chappelle bit but still white ppl treat interactions w/ the cops so causal like its an uncle they call over bc their dad died & their car need an oil change
1164 2018-05-09 21:57:05 And we cannot stop them because we rely on Saudi oil. God forbid North Korea refuses to disarm. This is a recipe for disaster.

1169 2018-05-09 21:56:43 Oil prices boom to highest levels in more than 3 years
Business Insider 7h

Oil prices rallied to multi-year highs on Wednesday, a day after President Donald Trump announced plans to withdraw the US from the Iran nuclear deal. 

West Texas Intermediate rose 2.8% to $71.17
1170 2018-05-09 21:56:43 The oil majors pulling out is further confirmation that this is a sunsetting industry, better to spend $ and political capital in a just transition then on pipelines and other infrastructure that don't make financial sense.
1171 2018-05-09 21:56:34 My nigga idk wth a carrier oil is.

1174 2018-05-09 21:56:16 I'm so torn between using my spare time to keep up on web development, or to spend it learning oil painting or watercolors. That's the problem with having a day job where I do neither one.

1178 2018-05-09 21:56:06 I agree with this move.. should save tons on energy, drastically reduce emissions, reduce oil dependence and frankly not raise home prices significantly.  Homes in the LA area are already over the million dollar mark in many cases so 10k won’t make a significant difference
1179 2018-05-09 21:56:04 What kind of grocery store doesn’t stock olive oil next to vinegar? They aren’t even in the same aisle!
1180 2018-05-09 21:56:00 Back in the day we bodybuilders basted ourselves for 10 minutes on each side and to increase the intensity of the tan, we applied baby oil instead of sun blocker.
1181 2018-05-09 21:55:59 Iran #oil exports are 2.6mbd. China and India import over half the total. Europe 0.5mbd. Market expectations of possible export losses are in the 200-700kbd range. #OOTT

1211 2018-05-09 21:53:29 I actually didn’t know about that so thanks for enlightening me, but if i think not getting a nuclear Iran takes great precedence over OPEC countries selling less oil.

1214 2018-05-09 21:52:58 Well Trump gave Putin's Russia everything. Trump forced a wedge between our allies & us which is Putin's dream, no Nato. He's forcing purchase of Russian oil over Iranian oil. 
This is Russia's foreign policy not ours.
Trump took the cash to make our foreign policy Russian's.
1215 2018-05-09 21:52:48 Robyn, no false claims on my support for Kinder Morgan. 

You and I will not agree on the many benefits of Canadian Oil Resources and getting them to the rest of the world, over 60 percent support Transmountain Twining.

I’ll let the many indigenous people speak for themselves
1216 2018-05-09 21:52:45 @realDonaldTrump thank you for driving up oil prices with your rhetoric vs Iran over the last year.  Eats up crumbs to most people from tax cut for wealthy! @krassenstein @TeaPainUSA @maddow @activist360 @FoxNews @AnnCoulter @nytimes @WSJ @washingtonpost @CNN

1218 2018-05-09 21:52:39 Thank you for sharing, I love natural mask. My fave is, green clay, activated charcoal, raw honey, raw vinegar, lavender and rose essential oil and black seed oil. You can even use it as face cleanser in the morning. No need to keep in the fridge. Recipe exchange
1219 2018-05-09 21:52:18 Meanwhile, if you're burning the midnight oil tonight, then tune into @talkSPORT just after 11.30pm. I'm ploughing through the back pages on public transport right now, just for you.
1220 2018-05-09 21:52:09 There are only 800 tapanuli organgutans left, so I'm upping my anti palm oil strategy.  It feels like I'm shouting into a huge chasm of producers who are happy to support deforestation and drive animals to extinction, but it's something.
1221 2018-05-09 21:52:06 During President Obama's term oil was $30/barrell & under @realDonaldTrump it's more than $70/barrel. Nothing great about that. Sure his Russian oil tycoons appreciate it tho.
1222 2018-05-09 21:52:02 I need a grounding so usually I put some lavender oil on my wrist and smell it until I calm down.

1242 2018-05-09 21:49:23 you predicted 'oil' well, good call, this Iran thing will 'fuel' oil too ...not to mention Trump's 'Jerusalem' decision next week hitting Jerusalem and Palestine, wet dream time for Netanyahu & the boys.....
1243 2018-05-09 21:49:18 His comments prove how ignorant they are outside production has been low while ours was up keeping prices here fairly low but still much higher than what they were when oil was originally at these prices decades ago

1247 2018-05-09 21:48:55 Need to get the oil pumping out of Anwar. Nothing better than Iran competition
1248 2018-05-09 21:48:35 A good full coverage, natural finish foundation is a good in betweener, because you can always make it more luminous or dewy with oil or a liquid highlight, but you can also easily mattify it if you would like

1250 2018-05-09 21:48:25 I have been trying to like natural peanut butter for YEARS but spilling peanut oil all over my favorite new shirt was the last straw. 

@Jif I’m coming back to you bb.
1251 2018-05-09 21:48:20 Y’all I just rescued a chipmunk off of a glue trap. If this ever happens, pour some cooking oil around it and help it wiggle off
1252 2018-05-09 21:48:18 Whatever happened to that world wide Glut of oil you kept talking about month after month?? Oil up 30 dollars!!
1253 2018-05-09 21:48:09 Going to be burning the midnight oil to get prepared for my @_respectme_ workshop! Looking forward to taking part in Virtually Safe Virtually Sound tomorrow at Aith Junior High School
1254 2018-05-09 21:48:09 So sad, yet Egypt was one of the big oil industry countries 

Excuse me asking but are you originally from Egypt?
1255 2018-05-09 21:47:53 It’s all about the oil price. Oil lobbyists & the crown prince of Saudi Arabia signing massive arms deals - but that’s just a coincidence 
1256 2018-05-09 21:47:52 cómo mola volver a ver a Oil y a Roque #fariña10
1257 2018-05-09 21:47:39 Girl!
1258 2018-05-09 21:47:31 But there was an oil rally today so ya know, yay for nations with heavy concentration toward petroleum.  Who could that be?  
1259 2018-05-09 21:47:31 Cranberries, walnuts and olive oil are a trio.
1260 2018-05-09 21:47:24 Just bought some massaging oil. 
See where I’m going with this ?
1261 2018-05-09 21:47:20 I’m slicker than baby oil boi
1262 2018-05-09 21:47:13 Ohhhh shit I ain’t even think of that. Let me go grab some castor oil for these struggle brows
1263 2018-05-09 21:47:08 Not to sound cocky or anything but being cute is hard when you’re living where the oil fields are located full of men.
1264 2018-05-09 21:47:01 love/hate getting my cars oil changed
1265 2018-05-09 21:46:59 Yes. Sanction should be tougher and also should be targeting the Revolutionary Guard and the oil industry more efficiently.
1266 2018-05-09 21:46:52 Well actually buddy, US gas production is at an all time high, which should result in lower prices, but instead we are shipping out of the country so that Oil companies can drive up prices at home and grow their international business.
1267 2018-05-09 21:46:49 So was his election, and after all, winning is what it's all about, and yes, our POTUS is impressive. Do you miss your slick snake oil salesman and his "Strategic Patience" LOL
1268 2018-05-09 21:46:49 The best thing to do is vote with your wallet & don't buy anything containing palm oil. You have to scrutinise ingredient lists & find wholesome food. Palm oil is bad for your health as well as the environment so do yourself & orangutans a favour & just say NO to palm oil.
1269 2018-05-09 21:46:46 You do realise that Saudi hates the Iran deal because it affects them regarding oil, prices and how they can treat Iran!
1270 2018-05-09 21:46:45 Bit of both! He works for land rover but has always tinkered with cars as a hobby, so motor oil and petroleum smells remind me of going to his garage to do things or help him
1271 2018-05-09 21:46:44 Hey Victor you know that PT in Brazil was linked to all sources of corruption by @nytimes people there were poor before and after PT, so, left wing mentality never works. Venezuela is a classic example a rich 80's oil country now fleeing to safe from Maduro/Chaves era.
1272 2018-05-09 21:46:36 Probably cheese and oil on everything isn’t helping either
1273 2018-05-09 21:46:28 just picked up oil for the first time in like two weeks and oh my god 

[SWEATING INTENSIFIES]
1274 2018-05-09 21:46:24 If the dragon spits hot oil, then yes
1275 2018-05-09 21:46:15 Palm oil or groundnut oil
1276 2018-05-09 21:46:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, and these voices to be heard.
1277 2018-05-09 21:46:07 Oh great how muck kickback will the GOP be getting in donations for the approval to pollute our air, water & land.  IMPEACH PRUITT or better yet move his office next to a superfund zone or an oil polluted farm land or better yet have all H20 come from wells around fracking sites
1278 2018-05-09 21:45:50 If I can oil it up at the beach
1279 2018-05-09 21:45:49 Glad you took time away from your big oil buddies and lobbyists to talk about the environment #ResignNow
1280 2018-05-09 21:45:42 Iraq is completely independent, is ran by Shias (what Chomsky thought impossible), has foreign policy that occasionally annoys US, and the goal of removing Saddam and installing some kind of democracy was fully achieved. US got no oil from Iraq, it got a lot from US shale.
1281 2018-05-09 21:45:42 Maybe now that oil prices are going up republicans morals will let them quit supporting Trump.
1282 2018-05-09 21:45:37 The guy doing my oil change scanned my car in and was like “so last time we used maxlife want to use that again” I told him I haven’t gotten my oil change done yet because it’s a new car I’ve only had for 2 months and it wasn’t due. He didn’t listen and kept telling me
1283 2018-05-09 21:45:33 Plastic is made with petroleum. With the price of oil increasing,  I especially want to encourage you to recycle plastic. 

In 2008 when fuel was so high,  the value of metals increased. Please consider recycling those too. 

1284 2018-05-09 21:45:31 Organic, no palm oil peanut butter or marmite.

1287 2018-05-09 21:45:06 Ag major who flunked chemistry was poor choice to follow Nobel laureate to take charge of our nukes? In fairness, Perry thought Energy Sec. lobbied for oil companies instead of regulating them, like Pruitt lobbying for polluters. Hardly the 1st time Gov. Oops has been confused.
1288 2018-05-09 21:44:54 Between all the shady dealing with RU, UAE,  the Sauds, and the rollback of our energy plan to prop up fossil fuels, sure looks like someone wants to control a big chunk of the oil supply.
1289 2018-05-09 21:44:45 Wall Street surges on higher oil after U.S. quits Iran deal
1290 2018-05-09 21:44:34 Known unknowns in the #oil market today: what a "substantial reduction" in Iranian crude imports means (to qualify for a sanctions waiver). Under Obama, it was ~20% drop each 180 days. Would the Trump administration demand the same or a higher reduction? #OOTT  1/2

1294 2018-05-09 21:44:03 The Iran Deal, the very thing you're whinning about. The moron doesn't know, or care, that it was a deal to watch over Iran and make sure they don't create nukes with the material they got from Russia. All this deal removal does is increase gas/oil prices and risks of more nukes.
1295 2018-05-09 21:43:57 It boils down to how much money his buddies in the oil business are going to make now that the price of oil is jumping up. He doesn’t care about anything but making money for him and his buddies.

1298 2018-05-09 21:43:30 I use that (and put it on my skin too). Also olive oil, depending on what I'm cooking.
1299 2018-05-09 21:43:29 Obviously this is a big bad deal for French oil companies, but it seems many Iranians are very happy at this - see #ThankYouTrump for some views. The bigger issue is what impact it will have on the mullahs combined with other calls for them to go in Iran.

If the Saudis decide to trade their oil in Euros instead of US-Dollars, your bankrupt economy based on credit will implode. You are aware of that fact, right? Right? SAD!

1310 2018-05-09 21:42:15 It's not official yet but the economy is grinding to almost a halt. Oil and gas up 20% in a month and the cost of money rising. This adds up to recession, but that is good news because the expectation is for more stimulus. There you have it, that is why markets are up
1311 2018-05-09 21:42:08 Castor oil
1312 2018-05-09 21:42:08 Russia needs a huge infusion of cash. Oil prices just spiked.
1313 2018-05-09 21:42:04 In 1953 they were accompanied by the US. Shortly afterwards the US started Iran's Nuclear program. To be fair, the UK and US only took about 80% of the known oil production in Iran. How generous of them.

1318 2018-05-09 21:41:21 Can't understand the spike in gas prices either. From what I've read there's enough oil out in N and S Dakota to last decades if not longer! Is there something preventing exploration there?
1319 2018-05-09 21:41:06 Nobody should forget the role of the Saudi Arabian Oil Company, Aramco, and its desire to raise oil prices and push competitors out of the market in order to get a high result for its Wall Street IPO.

1321 2018-05-09 21:41:01 He was wrong about everything there. He imagined it was some permanent occupation to control Iraqi oil, where reverse was true about everything. Iraq War happened to be stupid, but for about reverse reasons of what he claimed.

If we discover that the pyramids were in fact generators for electrical in energy in ancient times would we also then discover that this has been hidden from us since the times of Nikola Tesla just so we keep using oil?

1355 2018-05-09 21:38:05 Well, yes, but it also pleases Putin as oil prices rise.
1356 2018-05-09 21:37:46 The same Russian lawmakers who have Trump on their payroll are dependent on oil sales. They’re the only beneficiaries of Trump blowing up the Iran deal.

Just think about that for a second...

1374 2018-05-09 21:36:43 Thought for sure higher oil prices would have fixed some of the issues but the earnings report from Q1 was disappointing. I'm much more patient because I'm at least getting paid a dividend while waiting for things to turn around. Thinking Q2 pricing will hopefully show progress.
1375 2018-05-09 21:36:33 Why facts matter. Trump breaks Iran deal, stocks go up. Should Trump voters celebrate?

No. Dow went up because energy stocks went up. Energy stocks went up cause oil prices went up a lot. Rich did well. People who need to fill their car with gas will soon suffer. Facts matter...
1376 2018-05-09 21:36:33 I made coconut cake and chocolate olive oil cake for my kids' teachers and the act of handing them the slices of cake with a little note and a flower from our garden was prob more meaningful to me than it was to them. Feels good to say thank you. #TeacherAppreciationWeek2018
1377 2018-05-09 21:36:22 if it be a problem put that hater in his place. I’m slicker than a oil spill, sharper than a razor, I’m screamin any body kan get it like my homie major
1378 2018-05-09 21:36:19 The guys I work with call me olive oil arms....so my street cred is not in danger

1380 2018-05-09 21:36:10 Assuming you mean #CBD oil... likely cause a modest rise in #INR dt inhibition of CYP2C9 - check INR <7d. Not aware of any intrinsic anticoag properties. That said, oily plant extracts may contain other substances. Usual advice applies re: poor QA/regs for supplements!
1381 2018-05-09 21:36:03 Israel has no influence outsid  it will do whatever US wants it to do to be protected. So US wants to control the oil in the region its pitbull is Israel. Then Israel does its bidding.
1382 2018-05-09 21:35:53 I’ll bite. Went grocery shopping. You could call it trickle down economics. Grocery store makes money. Property management makes money. Employees have income. Farmers make money , they employ people.  Need gas to go shopping. Gas station, employees, oil companies etc.
1383 2018-05-09 21:35:48 I do already!  It's mostly the cooking oil that's gone.
1384 2018-05-09 21:35:43 My guuuuuuuuuy oil dey your head!
1385 2018-05-09 21:35:43 You should celebrate by posting another shirtless pic....
1386 2018-05-09 21:35:39 Me too! I ran out of furnace oil on the weekend and couldn’t get a delivery so thank god I didn’t have to talk to an attendant 5 times as I filled my gas can with 100l of diesel fuel lol
1387 2018-05-09 21:35:33 It is going to damage USA on many levels. You better watch. Oil prices will soar and we are more apt to be in another war. It's so STUPID
1388 2018-05-09 21:35:14 Iran deal Translated to truth, Iran sits on top of the largest sweet oil reserve in the world. (Sweet oil, needs little to no refining ). The US and Isreal want it. Let's make up another fake cause for war as in Iraq. Invade them and take their oil.
1389 2018-05-09 21:35:09 Don't ever buy phyto. That's not even their oil. They are just the third party to the distillate. Also it's not that good. Those types of companies put fillers in it to make more money.
1390 2018-05-09 21:35:02 They're not going to take a chance on it happened in Saudi Arabia. It exports too much oil.
1391 2018-05-09 21:34:52 I’m cool with matte full (as I powder) but can it sit well over oils? I oil my skin as moisturisers don’t work for me 
Also fair neutral/yellow tones please, all other brands seem to think all pale people have pink skin  And their first neutral shade is hella dark for me!
1392 2018-05-09 21:34:43 Disagree. Plan was worthless. Permitted Iran oil to be sold to EU. The plane full of cash was guarantee that TERRORISM would continue. Does Iran already have nukes. Would guess so. They got their yellow cake from Uranium One.
1393 2018-05-09 21:34:40 Just wait till the US gets hold of Iranian oil! Not that this is what is going on at all...
1394 2018-05-09 21:34:36 Yeah they are back where they were before the oil money came about drawing with the mighty Huddersfield....
1395 2018-05-09 21:34:33 we have our own supplies here in this country, we've been weaning away from foreign oil as fast as possible
1396 2018-05-09 21:34:30 4 to 5 times daily... Are you having sex or digging crude oil
1397 2018-05-09 21:34:20 lol! The prices always change. Remember when they were $4-$5. Could be worse! Big Oil getting greedy? Wake up yourself. MSM has you brainwashed. Tax cuts are so good you have Democratic leaders on West Coast trying to take it back. WHo's crooked again. Look @ the leaders u follow
1398 2018-05-09 21:34:05 The vapour rub I’m using does have that in it but I think I might have to go and buy the oil itself and try it out  I just want to sleep peacefully 
1399 2018-05-09 21:33:59 Pretty sure this has already been done (in effect), CIA sabotaging oil pipeline s/w 'stolen' by Soviets in the 80's. Not much is new these days.
1400 2018-05-09 21:33:45 I've started preparing to stock food for my home before ramdhan, what i need now most  is cooking oil & a bag of rice even small size. I've a job but the Salary is not that much I've a lot to cover.
1401 2018-05-09 21:33:36 Either way, we suckered them into taking half their oil money frozen for hostage taking in exchange for the nuclear deal.
1402 2018-05-09 21:33:35 Edomites Globalist specializes in TRUTH suppression. Their CONTINUED GENOCIDE against Hebrew Biafra to steal oil is clear evidence.
1403 2018-05-09 21:33:33 @realDonaldTrump - your barefaced lies about the #IranDealWithdrawal - I'm still trying to understand why.
Was it about price of oil?
Or arms sales?
Giving Israel a green light to go to war?
Occupation of Syrian land?
A bet with Pompeo?
Your hatred of Obama?
All of the above?
1404 2018-05-09 21:33:31 You sound like a oil and gas person. Im not saying to change from coal and gas overnight. Eventually it will have happen.
1405 2018-05-09 21:33:26 I love America too, but I didn’t buy the snake oil
1406 2018-05-09 21:33:20 Not true at all. You are not understanding where these checks are. You apply for an EUR1 before you move the goods. They are not border checks...how could they be? Say a salad dressing is a border force officer going to sniff it and say it's Moroccan olive oil or Spanish?
1407 2018-05-09 21:33:20 @rosariodawson HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!  YOU’RE AGING LIKE YOU BATH IN COCONUT OIL, PRAYER & STEM CELLS EVERY NIGHT  
1408 2018-05-09 21:33:17 I need a oil change
1409 2018-05-09 21:33:15 I continued my hedge in oil due to the uncertainty following the withdrawal from the deal and because of situations like this.

1412 2018-05-09 21:33:10 Hm. Repudiating Iran deal destabilizes the price of oil, raising the per barrel cost. Oil is the mainstay of the moribund Russian economy. No collusion here!

1416 2018-05-09 21:32:25 I use Lush - Vanishing Cream. Super light coverage. But it's kinda pricey, at least for my student budget. I used to use Neutrogena Oil Free (the pump bottle) which rocked, but they stopped importing it to my country.

Her arms remaining wrapped around him as she rinced the soap from his back. “Mm I’m glad my love” Eva mused as she lay back -
1418 2018-05-09 21:32:19 I am the only candidate in this race who has pledged to not take contributions from the oil, gas, and coal industry and instead prioritize the health of our families, climate, and democracy over fossil fuel industry profits. #ActOnClimate
1419 2018-05-09 21:32:18 Great question...Since there are only trace amounts of THC in CBD oil, there is no harm in trying it especially topically.
1420 2018-05-09 21:32:13 Pls buy deodorant all these brown mans be smelling like sweat and hair oil and I’ve had enough.
1421 2018-05-09 21:31:59 Oh you know that carpet screams for nuln oil
1422 2018-05-09 21:31:53 If you live in a place with perpetual sunshine solar panels are a must. Africa and the Middle East should be covered in them. Make a cheap solar/electric hybrid vehicle you would dramatically reduce oil consumption in those regions.
1423 2018-05-09 21:31:49 i can’t go one day without getting oil paint on my clothes
1424 2018-05-09 21:31:46 What I explained to you were my intraday trades based on intraday fractals? another pot for my long term trades..note that it is always rolling as per the day fractals..your question  is like ship of theseus question..you replace all the parts on a ship..is it the same ship?.:)
1425 2018-05-09 21:30:52 Not to state the obvious but the Iran deal wasn’t one-sided. It’s backfired for Trump. That oil he loves so much will be going to the European Union, China, Japan and India for a cheaper price.

1427 2018-05-09 21:30:45 is anyone into contemporary oil/acrylic painting? i desperately need to browse more recent work and work that isnt entirely by dudes
1428 2018-05-09 21:30:39 I’m researching the CBD oil. But can’t start unless approved by pain doc.  It may show on pee tests. Haven’t had a positive one EVER..  we know we’ll never be pain free, just want to get through the day. Is that too much to ask?  Thx for listening.  DM or tweet me anytime 
1429 2018-05-09 21:30:31 Good for oil producers, bad for consumers. Same pattern of big companies first, real people last.

1434 2018-05-09 21:30:12 Why the fuck is olive oil so expensive

Feeling quite (very) nervous in a #bigpaintingchallenge gone wrong way! 

Not sure if too much of a challenge but its going to be an oil abstract piece  @stormartgallery #padiham #paintingpadiham @padiham #Burnley #art
1438 2018-05-09 21:30:07 If I'm not mistaken, the "Norwegian Model" is to get filthy rich selling oil so that you can afford expensive things like electric cars.
1439 2018-05-09 21:30:06 Oil esta en un liO.
1440 2018-05-09 21:29:52 There's money to be made! Billions as price of oil skyrockets when we quit #IranNukeDeal ! Oligarchs and billionaires who bought and sold our country to Trump will profit! Citizens pay more at the gas pump! And dear MAGAts, it will be Your boys who go to war, not theirs.
1441 2018-05-09 21:29:46 You know who was favorited by him once and had an orgasm. $300 oil would destroy western civilization and now does it happen
1442 2018-05-09 21:29:41 They want us to BE Russia. Mostly white, oil based economy run by oligarchs with the help of the church to oppress LGBTQA, women, and minorities. Putin’s greatest strength was his ability to marry state pride to the church.
1443 2018-05-09 21:29:39 The EPA’s secret waivers gave multi-billion-dollar oil companies a handout while the rural economy suffers. Farmers deserve better.
1444 2018-05-09 21:29:34 And if the US does that, oil prices have already gone up, because most US oil is pretty expensive to produce.
1445 2018-05-09 21:29:30 Only use zinc oxide, and natural oil, that's safest

1448 2018-05-09 21:29:15 It shouldnt be. Check how much water you’re putting maybe add a little less. Then after it’s done drizzle a little olive oil and fluff it with a fork it shouldn’t stick after that 
1449 2018-05-09 21:29:14 I hate not having my car. Like I’ve gotta get an oil change, and I won’t have it for like an hour and a half. But what if I need to drive somewhere and get something in that hour and a half?  I can’t. Because no car... temporarily 
1450 2018-05-09 21:29:12 Maybe he forgot about it, maybe he just decided I was full of shit. But I made these guys fill out a release statement when they agreed to talk to me that guaranteed them a free copy of the book when its out. I really hope he hasn't changed his address.
1451 2018-05-09 21:29:10 But like what baby oil she using Bc us black girls wanna glo
1452 2018-05-09 21:29:07 Ugh. When was the last time we had oil this high?
1453 2018-05-09 21:29:06 You a fan of Russia, too? The definition of patriotism does seem to be changing these days, doesn't it? I support the interest of the American people over multi-national corporations profiting by selling American oil to China. And America should not buy oil from Saudi Arabia.
1454 2018-05-09 21:28:59 It’s so scary to think that the world will more than likely run out of oil in my lifetime

1458 2018-05-09 21:28:24 Yeah, its just slumping oil prices that did it, nothing at all to do with socialism, because its apparently never been done correctly….
1459 2018-05-09 21:28:09 @realDonaldTrump Strategically Iran now needs to be contained and hemmed in so they can no longer destabilise Yemen or surrounding countries like Iraq or Kuwait. The #OPEC cartel and #Oil prices need discussion and stabilisation to protect Western economic interests #MAGA

All about the oil companies. Never the environment.
1462 2018-05-09 21:27:46 Fascinating-how much revenue (i.e wealth for Scotland) did Renewables generate for us in the last year and how does that compare to the revenue brought in by oil and gas? I’m hoping you didn’t just make stuff up...
1463 2018-05-09 21:27:40 And ppl , pro oil exec bots that is, crying about it adding 10k to the price know it will more than pay for itself.
1464 2018-05-09 21:27:37 Because they sell that black liquid stuff called Oil.
1465 2018-05-09 21:27:36 Yep. I just met a new service advisor and found out what car he drives, what his daughter drives, why he sold her car and bought something different, and where he lives.  Cool. I just wanted an oil change.
1466 2018-05-09 21:27:33 @PnPCBC Why not just get the oil executives themselves on instead of the clowns they own?
1467 2018-05-09 21:27:33 This is not uncommon here, esp in his age range. SAD SAD. He was a whaler back in the day at 16 years old, Norwegians used to hire deck hands out of Tangalooma Island in Qld. So he was in the sun his entire life. Never ate Veg oil, always butter.
1468 2018-05-09 21:27:24 In other words, smoke and mirrors. He’s a snake oil salesman, a flimflam man.

1472 2018-05-09 21:26:52 For the last 23 years the oil ministers have been Aramco men.  So their actions are more like Aramco involvement in govt than govt involvement in Aramco
1473 2018-05-09 21:26:52 Maybe we should just let Israel take over all the other countries in the area. All the oil could be yours, Jacob!  Yours and all of the other deserving Jews. Give it all to your people. Just like the Palestinians land. It’s all yours!  Gods chosen ones. #trumpscrotum.
1474 2018-05-09 21:26:48 For the next year or so Brian would check in on me just to see how the book was coming. I'd always tell him it was close no matter how far away it actually was. Eventually, I guess three years ago, he stopped.

1480 2018-05-09 21:26:30 I’m told it ran and was even serviced shortly before the winter. I have a slight suspicion that it may have been filled with gas/oil mix before we drained the tank, not sure what else would be that dark.

1482 2018-05-09 21:26:24 No offense but do you mean to tell me it has had nothing to do with the rising oil prices recently?

1488 2018-05-09 21:25:42 I can change the oil in my car and a tire if need be (amongst other things) but that never stops someone’s dad from rushing over to assist me when I’m about to put air in my tires. Which like, by all means please do. Dads just love doing dad things.
1489 2018-05-09 21:25:40 FYI!! You might want to get an oil based cleanser for the lip whips since they are super transfer proof and won't come off your lips easily! You can buy their lip whip removers but a regular oil cleanser can still do the trick! :3

1491 2018-05-09 21:25:31 @JoyceHonda never take your car here for service.  The free oil changes are not worth this much time out of your life that you can’t get back. And don’t trust them when you call and they say that there is no wait.  Second time burned by that. Not coming back.
1492 2018-05-09 21:25:19 I’m surprised it burned a 2nd time in 24 hours. Three times in 20 years is notable ... and expensive. 

Was the visible fire as dramatic 20 years ago as it was this week? The flames & smoke looked more like that produced by burning crude oil rather than mineral oil.
1493 2018-05-09 21:25:16 Yep. Lots you can do with coconut oil though. I mix in with coffee.
1494 2018-05-09 21:25:05 Interesting times, in other words worrying times! More spending on arms, volatility in oil prices, jostling between russia & US for power

1496 2018-05-09 21:24:53 9 months later when I was in Arizona, Brian sent me an email asking how the book was going. He said I should get all the players together after I'm done and have a party. I told him that sounded like a great idea and that I was about to talk to Alan Zinter. 

"Tell Alan I say hi"
1497 2018-05-09 21:24:44 I really don’t understand the whole racism accusion and once we turn off the tap of oil money. Iran won’t have enough money for food never mind a bomb. And btw ask Europe how going up against the American military has gone for them in the past.

1503 2018-05-09 21:24:11 Noone is tolerating it. She's probably already hanging from a tree the way most are reacting to it.
1504 2018-05-09 21:24:11 Shale oil is very light and does not yield much distallates. At the same time, diesel demand has been growing with the economy.
1505 2018-05-09 21:24:09 And now gas prices jumpin! Yet oil not even in demand like that to justify these prices! Stay woke!
1506 2018-05-09 21:24:06 What did the price of oil do since yesterday?
1507 2018-05-09 21:23:56 I believe it is snake oil for anything except certain types of poisoning (and they inserted into the stomach via a tube).

1509 2018-05-09 21:23:48 #Bush: Ah yes, the fable of 'The Scorpion and the Ass/Donkey' comes to mind with how the US Gov't tricked the likes of Saddam and Gaddafi. With the latter, they robbed #Libya and northern #Africa of their own central bank and alternative reserved currency, plus *oil* if course.
1510 2018-05-09 21:23:48 What kind of back door Oil deal did the EU and Great Britain make with Iran to make them try and convince everyone that it was a good deal?
1511 2018-05-09 21:23:46 Worry not curaçao, you may not get all the goodies from Pdvsa in exchange for your vote at international platforms supporting Dictatorship, but in the long run you will be in better standing with American and 1st world oil companies as  partners.
Karma is a bitch!
1512 2018-05-09 21:23:35 Maybe it’s time to ban @jannarden seems Alberta has supported her funny one day it’s tar sands next day its oil sands either way Alberta supported @jannarden maybe we boycott those who don’t support Alberta
1513 2018-05-09 21:23:35 Wearing body oil and now I’m even more in love with myself  #SelfLove2018
1514 2018-05-09 21:23:31 Waiting for an oil change and this man is calling Cracker Barrel because he saw a billboard for pancakes that said "so fluffy you don't even need..." but he missed the last word and can't rest until he finds the answer
1515 2018-05-09 21:23:30 -Shifting Eva shuffled behind him and grabbed some of the oil he’d placed in there bath, her petit fingers working at the muscles in his back. Easing out the tension he carried, “How does that feel my love?” She asked as her hands slipped around to his front
1516 2018-05-09 21:23:27 Data is the new oil.
1517 2018-05-09 21:23:08 Lmao, why does an oil rich country need nuclear energy?

Thanks, I too had issues with link.
1518 2018-05-09 21:22:45 Bruh i Love the Smell Of Tea Tree Oil
1519 2018-05-09 21:22:45 Quiero cambios en mi vida
1520 2018-05-09 21:22:41 @MassacringKitty Happens to the best of us! Have you taken care of the oil change?
1521 2018-05-09 21:22:36 Oil that is!
1522 2018-05-09 21:22:34 Oil change like from ' The Program'?
1523 2018-05-09 21:22:30 You lying fool.  The DJIA is *down* over 2,000 points from where it was in January, not up.  Learn math, it's handy in adult life.  Since you were elected, retail gas is up 30% and crude oil is up 60%.  #MAGA your leader is a LIAR, a CON MAN, and a COLLUDER.
1524 2018-05-09 21:22:20 Is Trump not White? Is Netanyahu not White? And so far I’ve only seen posts from White people here gleefully encouraging the call the War much like when WE bombed Syria the other week. It’s all about oil and total control of the Middle East. How quickly we all forget Libya,Iraq..
1525 2018-05-09 21:22:19 Gels have the same issue to be honest one they start to lift. There are things that can help. Cuticle oil helps acrylic adhere longer. And rubber gloves are a godsend to keep your hands dry haha!
1526 2018-05-09 21:22:17 Rising oil price comes at a very opportune time for a heavily sanctioned Russian economy that depends almost entirely on oil exports...
1527 2018-05-09 21:22:12 I have no respect for Men who don't change their own oil and do basic maintenance on their car.

It's like yea.. you have the lumberjack look but don't want to get dirty
1528 2018-05-09 21:22:07 After the interview was over, Brian asked me why I didn't ask him about his Jewish heritage. I didn't have a good answer. I wish I had but I suppose my thinking was that I didn't ask any of the black players I talked to about race so why would this be different?
1529 2018-05-09 21:22:07 Higher oil prices.
1530 2018-05-09 21:21:39 It's called GENIE OIL 
1531 2018-05-09 21:21:37 I should apply some oil on my screen be4 swiping like that 
1532 2018-05-09 21:21:35 Can you make the semiautomatic thingy make them pull the trigger once per shot?
1533 2018-05-09 21:21:35 i’m putting coconut oil on my eyelashes does that do anything or am I just dumb
1534 2018-05-09 21:21:19 - use tea tree oil to dry out your pimples and make them go away (igselfcaremoods)
- exfoliate 2x a week so that you can get rid of all of the dead skin cells and excess oil that built up 
- drink water 
1535 2018-05-09 21:21:15 May merkal macron  they’re fkn mad. All about oil money and deals
1536 2018-05-09 21:21:07 I think the health authority, combined with federal status and proposed provincial regs, make edibles a definite no go. We currently carry capsules and THC/CBD coconut oil, which you can add to a freshly baked good or cooked food.
1537 2018-05-09 21:21:01  helllllll yeah imma be fully covered bcos of the burning oil splashing everywhere but i can LMAOo
1538 2018-05-09 21:20:59 Did you even read it? Maybe if they slip your name into it, you'll have someone read it to you. You have no idea what you just did, nor do you care. Gas & oil will spike, Iran will pursue weapons, and the sanctions you want to enact will force them to go to Russia. Putin puppet.
1539 2018-05-09 21:20:56 Rosehip oil has changed my skin. Facts are facts
1540 2018-05-09 21:20:34 Aye. So did dropping oil in water !
1541 2018-05-09 21:20:30 tea tree oil mamis and witch hazel, but dilute the tea tree oil with water
1542 2018-05-09 21:20:16 Donald Trump 
What happened to oil prices when the Iran deal was signed?
The oil price dropped because there was greater supply. 
2 months ago the prince of Saudi Arabia signed massive deals with DT. What will happen to the oil price now the Iran deal is broken? wTFu 
1543 2018-05-09 21:20:13 @Okbabyyt hey!! Just watched your recent vlog. The little sign in your car does mean oil change, but they themselves have to turn it off using their system, the people that work at the place where you got your oil change. Love you!!!
1544 2018-05-09 21:20:12 AND the price of Russian oil went up. Putin wins again with trump as his puppet 
1545 2018-05-09 21:20:05 RAISING OIL PRICE,MORE PROFIT FOR GULF,MORE SALES OF ARM TO SAUDIS
1546 2018-05-09 21:20:04 Bell you and “honest” are like water & oil...

1549 2018-05-09 21:19:46 I've heard a lot of negative things about Unicorn Oil but my friend has it and she loves it so I bought some for myself and I'll try it out when I get it.
1550 2018-05-09 21:19:38 Use panko for the breading it makes for a crunchier more airy feel. Also i prefer peanut oil it makes for a faster and more through fry
1551 2018-05-09 21:19:36 Oil rich Arab nations have for decades funded Murderous lawless mercenaries to do their dirty work. Acting as proxy for 1 interest or vendetta or another. Syria has been awash with lawless Saudi funded shitbag terrorists killing civilians exploiting neighbourhoods bringing death.
1552 2018-05-09 21:19:18 One year might be an exaggeration. It was more like 3 weeks when David Justice got hurt. Still, he got some hits and got that ring. Barry Bonds doesn't have a World Series ring.
1553 2018-05-09 21:19:13 My least favorite oil is turmoil #sixwords
1554 2018-05-09 21:19:11 I am fair skinned. In Canada I burned easily and thus covered up and used sunscreen. Then I dumped refined carbs, seed oil, and moved to Australia. I now go unprotected much more and almost never burn ...

1559 2018-05-09 21:18:10 Definetely gotta go get me some more coconut oil.
1560 2018-05-09 21:18:09 Oil and Mexico can fuck off. That is all.
1561 2018-05-09 21:18:01 Warm shower with some lavender oil streaming at once, pepper dem gang
1562 2018-05-09 21:17:53 Coz the Mullahs have some oil
1563 2018-05-09 21:17:51 the real reason : to rise oil price and weak EU
1564 2018-05-09 21:17:43 Lol My assistance have been adding oil to the fire all day. I'm scared to go work in the office tomorrow... I can't babysit them 24/7...
1565 2018-05-09 21:17:39 One question, what country stands to profit if Iranian oil is banned in Europe. That's right you got it Russia. Maybe this why Putin put Trump in the WH. Everyone is busy guessing why and the answer is right in front of you. We're talking Billions.
1566 2018-05-09 21:17:38 just had someone come round to check my car at this time because i thought it needed oil in it, turns out it doesnt i was reading the stick wrong whilst parked on a hill  i am a mong 
1567 2018-05-09 21:17:28 The thing was whether or not this anxiety caused it, Brian was really good at baseball. So good that he won ACC player of the year and got drafted by the Braves in the first 10 rounds. And at every level he hit. He has a world series ring too from 1994 his 1 year in the majors.
1568 2018-05-09 21:17:25 Well oil exports must be kept flowing, exempt. A cornered ‘animal’ needs a way out! #IranDealWithdrawal
1569 2018-05-09 21:17:23 Doubt it. The other partner nations are staying with the deal. Which means Iran can still sell them oil and do business with them. I’m not really sure what Trump accomplished other than leaving our seat at the table empty.
1570 2018-05-09 21:17:09 THATS SO NASTY 

I HATE OLIVE OIL
1571 2018-05-09 21:16:59 
1572 2018-05-09 21:16:56 thanks everyone who voted for trump. tariffs on Iranian oil, gas gonna be well over 4 a gallon. have fun fillin up them big ol trucks

1575 2018-05-09 21:16:23 What a shame human beings have become 
We already have a mercury warning on rice coming from China, the fish in the gulf have a carcinogen from the lies about the clean up of oil spill, also seafood from Japan 
With Russia’s nuclear bomb floating
1576 2018-05-09 21:16:23 Why don’t you pack up your stuff and move to a third world oil producing country. Wonder how they’d respond to some comments like that?
1577 2018-05-09 21:16:19 2% sulfur #petcoke FOB US West Coast heard to trade Wednesday for $154/mt for 40,000 mt, down $2 from last trade heard. #Oil #carbon
1578 2018-05-09 21:16:13 #Iran isn't responsible for much more than defending it's borders. When it has entered Syria it has come in and helped it to fight Murderous terror groups killing civilians. The middle East has Turkey Egypt Israel Saudi Arabia & the rest of the Gulf oil/gas rich dictatorships
1579 2018-05-09 21:16:03 Apply a few drops of coconut oil on a cotton ball & wipe your face, it will remove your make up & give your skin a natural glow! #homeremedy
1580 2018-05-09 21:16:01 Im very not good at oil paste from art class
1581 2018-05-09 21:15:59 I use sundown natural pure vitamin e oil from Walgreens. It's hella thick but it mixes well for a face mask or you can use it alone and leave it on overnight
1582 2018-05-09 21:15:58 We are trying to make money trading Iran's oil which gives them money to build weapons while at the same time making money selling Saudi weapons to fight Iran in Yemen. Madness. #BBCNews
1583 2018-05-09 21:15:46 I third the olive oil. It takes a few days. Use a pillow case you don't mind ruining.
1584 2018-05-09 21:15:40 If I was cynical  I'd think everything America does is always about oil or the price of oil.

I'm cynical.
1585 2018-05-09 21:15:39 Baby oil
1586 2018-05-09 21:15:36 jojoba the underrated oil lol
1587 2018-05-09 21:15:32 The oil importers
1588 2018-05-09 21:15:28 My entire body is made of rancid cooking oil
1589 2018-05-09 21:15:25 Fully agree, left overdoes it. But they were incompetent and selfish to create civil war in anti-Jihadi countries like Iraq,Libya and Syria- all 3 had nothing to do with Sep 11. This was done for oil security/ Israeli interests. The real culprits are Saudi Salafist regime.
1590 2018-05-09 21:15:23 What about your oil resources? Why don't you use thermoelectric power?
1591 2018-05-09 21:15:07 What we got was a good old fashioned oil field f******

1593 2018-05-09 21:14:58 I hate having to get my oil changed by myself  lol i be wanting a bf for these reasons
1594 2018-05-09 21:14:55 Global production is up 900k in last 3m and 2.3mbbl in last year. These prices are unleashing a torrent of oil that only self inflicted OPEC wounds (via SA on VZ/Iran) made possible by Trump. Oil is not going vertical before midterms IMO.
1595 2018-05-09 21:14:43 @CNN @MSNBC @AP @AprilDRyan @ReutersPolitics Isn’t getting Russian money through Cohen, then helping drive up oil by breaking Iran agreement evidence of treason? Be all over this please! @andersoncooper @MichaelAvenatti
1596 2018-05-09 21:14:35 I've been thinking about this... what sunscreen is an oil?
1597 2018-05-09 21:14:19 So I thought I would be all self efficient and top off my oil, I PUT THE WRONG OIL IN MY CAR 
But its okay, I called the oil place and they said the oils weren't much different.
I had myself a mini heart attack lol
1598 2018-05-09 21:14:17 SOP sounds like to me.
1599 2018-05-09 21:14:16 Really? That’s even better. I bought a storage thing for my oil paints yesterday, it had a big made in Britain sticker, it made it feel special.
1600 2018-05-09 21:14:03 Tea tree oil works wonders
1601 2018-05-09 21:14:02 My 2003 protege was given to me by my pastor for free.
In 1 year I put 4 tires. And oil changes.
So brakes, rotors, drums, hubs, bearings, control arms/ball joints, tie rods and expensive bolts is ok.

Fortunately the struts are good.
1602 2018-05-09 21:13:55 The reason we’re getting 40 cents on the dollar is because we have no access to the ocean. I think the North is a great idea. Why would ANY company Canadian or otherwise invest in Canada’s oil with the crap that’s happening?
1603 2018-05-09 21:13:49 Oil drilling in or near the Everglades   NOT a good idea
1604 2018-05-09 21:13:44 Not that he was some kind of dweeb. One of the first things he told me was how his own anxiety and fear of failure was what inspired him to become a better player. He didn't want to be a goat. In fact, all he really wanted to do was run around catching fly balls.

1613 2018-05-09 21:12:45 Women supporting women. 
1614 2018-05-09 21:12:42 Iran even fired missiles to Porkistan and a big supplier of oil to India.
1615 2018-05-09 21:12:40 I don’t have cable at home, but I’ve been watching TV in the Ford lobby while my oil is being changed for over an hour, and I just realized that I can’t stand most of the people on HGTV. I love home improvement but these PEOPLE. ARE. MONSTERS. 
1616 2018-05-09 21:12:35 And they all make loads more money as the price of oil goes up after years of stagnation
1617 2018-05-09 21:12:14 The income picture for the 1970s is complicated, if I remember right. The Arab oil embargo screwed up the economy a lot but even so income gains in the 1970s were fairly impressive. In any event, median income gains are smaller since the 80s than in the postwar decades.
1618 2018-05-09 21:12:13 Tea tree oil and aloe Vera. The natural kind of both. That's all I use.
1619 2018-05-09 21:12:04 So... Spanky announced pulling out of the deal to make oil prices go up which would directly benefit the nation that organized to put him in office?

...awesome...
1620 2018-05-09 21:12:01 Wow coconut oil is the most powerful makeup remover on earth or what? Works like magic!
1621 2018-05-09 21:11:57 @realDonaldTrump How to make sure the US shale oil industry become sustainable again? Take out a significant oil producer by slapping sanctions on them which keeps the oil price inflated. We see you 
1622 2018-05-09 21:11:53 sure say them dey buy groundnut oil na daily for that house 
1623 2018-05-09 21:11:51 We are looking the other way at Iran's establishing the region and threatening Israel so we can sell Iran a few airbusses and make a few quid trading Iranian oil. #BBCNews

1628 2018-05-09 21:11:37 Thanks Amir Waheed for your kindness and first ever sponcer of my event Shahtaj oil and Ghee.
1629 2018-05-09 21:11:37 Your article left me with an unsquared circle. If the Euros et al remain in JCPOA and shield their companies from US secondary sanctions, Iran won't want to cheat, deal remains. US companies are biggest losers, Iran loses modest bit of oil revenue. Sloppy, sure. Disastrous - why?
1630 2018-05-09 21:11:36 I wonder how the oil companies are screwing the people on gas prices because of Iran and we don't even get oil from them. Nothing has changed other than the people getting screwed. That was something that Bush and Obama done with the Democrats.
1631 2018-05-09 21:11:31 I want a full body baby oil massage 
1632 2018-05-09 21:11:30 It’s because when we invade them for their oil they’d have weapons to defend themselves & our government wouldn’t like that 
1633 2018-05-09 21:11:26 If he was taken aback by it, he didn't say anything. Jocks get painted as an arrogant sort but Brian Kowitz was anything but. In fact I'm not even sure you can consider him that. The way he talked to me about baseball reminded me of a shy kid talking about a girl he liked.
1634 2018-05-09 21:11:26 Sure, we don't will forget. 
This are not empty words. History talks for me.
We don't have oil, but we have lot of things. For example, big memory.

1638 2018-05-09 21:11:02 In the last day I learned my target cashier needs an oil change, my clients neighbor has lived there for 40 years and the Starbucks guy works as an actor. Does this happen to everyone or is there something about me that makes strangers tell me things?
1639 2018-05-09 21:10:56 1. Money flows to Cohen from Russians (et al) after the election.
2. Trump pulls out of Iran deal.
3. Price of oil spikes, and drives us apart from allies — both wins for Putin, who wants to break up NATO and who’s economy is desperate for higher oil prices.
#Treason!
1640 2018-05-09 21:10:48 By the way if you have a friend or relative who operates any of the curio shops in Westlands triangle after all the way from Oil libya on the left hand side tell him or her to remove her wares. Payment was made 6 months ago, Notice expired 2 weeks ago. Kesho 5am tuko hapo,
1641 2018-05-09 21:10:44 you’re telling me  my dumbass is still waiting for oil paint to dry
1642 2018-05-09 21:10:41 You're putting us in an adversarial relationship with our European Allies while driving the price of oil up. I wonder who this benefits? I bet the person this is meant to please has a tape of you while two of his agents use you as a toilet.
1643 2018-05-09 21:10:36 [I returned to you, a bottle of expensive oil in my hands. I was dressed in nothing but a sheer blue robe. 

I smiled and set the bottle down next to the table.] Lay down... [I said, eyeing your body.]
1644 2018-05-09 21:10:32 Do you use essential oils? 

I LOVE THEM!!! My favorite is Lavender oil!!!
1645 2018-05-09 21:10:30 I hate the smell of Olive Oil oilsheen.

1650 2018-05-09 21:09:59 Olive oil
1651 2018-05-09 21:09:55 You have been one of the Top I follow when it comes to oil.  Maybe start an oil fund?  Go long and short with your timing?  Seem to have a gift 
1652 2018-05-09 21:09:51 Who do cheap oil changes but does other thangs
1653 2018-05-09 21:09:50 Joy is the oil for discipline. Focus on joy consistently during any practice and you will develop discipline.
1654 2018-05-09 21:09:49 US Companies draw the bitumen out. They sell our oil to themselves. Of course they will undercut oil prices by telling Alberta it's crap oil. A blind man can see the conflict but little that can be done when no Canadian company is willing to invest billions.
1655 2018-05-09 21:09:36 #BREAKING - King County has filed suit against 5 of the largest oil companies, claiming they knowingly contributed to climate disruptions. Co claims they put people in King Co at greater risk of floods, landslides and more.
1656 2018-05-09 21:09:34 my house is so hot that my coconut oil has completely melted.
i didnt realize while opening it & now theres a whole 14 ounces of coconut oil alllll over my floor.
this is literally hell.
1657 2018-05-09 21:09:24 Yes. Its plastic mixed with oil mixed with nuclear waste and then cotton.
1658 2018-05-09 21:09:17 Aye, the price of oil keeps rising!
1659 2018-05-09 21:09:14 Adult acne (and other "adult" skin problems! is HARD! I've had good luck with quitting dairy, using jojoba oil to double cleanse, and use diluted tea tree oil to spot treat. I also exfoliate once a week and use a vitamin c serum.
1660 2018-05-09 21:09:11 Not sure how.. but coconut oil fixes everything 
1661 2018-05-09 21:08:59 Do h recommend a specific vitamin e oil
1662 2018-05-09 21:08:57 Lawmakers could ban, along with e-cigarette flavors, tobacco, alcohol, candy, soda pop, cookies, bread, French fries, oil, sun tanning
 and everything fun etc., etc.,but people would still find ways to find new things to do that offend the nanny police. Just leave us alone!
1663 2018-05-09 21:08:54 Heh. @dowconstantine suing oil companies for polluting the planet, whilst using oil to pollute the planet.
1664 2018-05-09 21:08:53 So here I was the next morning walking into this mortgage office, completely sleep deprived and sounding like an old man with a 3-pack a day habit. I hadn't been doing laundry at the fake frat house and am fairly sure I was wearing sweat pants.
1665 2018-05-09 21:08:52 as long as its not extra-virgin i think it works mighty fine ;) something strange happens when you cook extra-virgin oil, it stinks.
1666 2018-05-09 21:08:46 Congratulations! Where can someone buy the Bustan El Zeitoun olive oil?
1667 2018-05-09 21:08:45 Just listened to an excellent interview with @EricLiptonNYT on @NPR Fresh Air regarding Trump’s @EPAScottPruitt secretive and corrupt activities working with the oil and coal companies on tax payer dime. Please catch it if you can the podcast.
1668 2018-05-09 21:08:39 Under the Harper Conservative government, two entirely new oil pipelines were approved and actually built: The non-XL version of Keystone, from Alberta to Nebraska, approved in 2006, completed in 2010; and The Alberta Clipper, to Wisconsin, approved in 2008 and active in 2010
1669 2018-05-09 21:08:38 High gas prices are caused by high crude oil prices. That's because oil costs account for 72 percent of the price of gasoline. The remaining 28 percent comes from distribution, refining, and taxes, which are more stable.

But not fighting back, and just rolling over while an imperialist war machine bulldozes the world for gas coal and oil isn't an acceptable answer.
1672 2018-05-09 21:08:11 Note this is basically money sitting in accts idle.

1675 2018-05-09 21:08:04 Price of oil per barrel went up again today, after Trump stopped the nuclear deal with the Iranians.
1676 2018-05-09 21:07:54 The answer seems obvious to me, but "journalism" and "ethics" is akin to oil and water these days.
1677 2018-05-09 21:07:52 It's all about the oil...
1678 2018-05-09 21:07:17 Natural gas   Not oil
1679 2018-05-09 21:07:07 OMG can we just get back to hating oil again. This is weird.
1680 2018-05-09 21:07:05 Israel lobby, oil and weapon sales.

1681 2018-05-09 21:06:46 babylon the whore that sell oil in exchange for gold thats whats gonna get attack first everything is goin right on plan once damacus fall iran who backed by russia and now china just said they are in fallin the fall out of iran deal will launch missles against the saudis
1682 2018-05-09 21:06:46 Life is like a tube of lube... somedays you want oil based, somedays water but given the sheer amount of A$$holes we meet on a daily basis it is best NOT to run out.
1683 2018-05-09 21:06:42 おはよー
1684 2018-05-09 21:06:40 Also in said parking lot were shopping carts filled to the brim where there should have been cars. The TV would have been state of the art in 1992. I made the mistake of looking up the motel on yelp after checking in. I didn't sleep.
1685 2018-05-09 21:06:39 The oil change people got me y’all
1686 2018-05-09 21:06:32 Nobody within the vast majority of Europe (economic area) trades on simple FTA or WTO terms.  Counting oil, whisky & services exports in the same way as items needed for import & regional exports is ridiculous.
1687 2018-05-09 21:06:29 Baby when I tell ya I’m olive oil down and letting this sun soak I AM 
1688 2018-05-09 21:06:06 Probably should add one more notation to the map.  "Oil prices rise significantly following pullout from nuke deal, helping Russia to raise badly needed capital."  Don taking care of his old friend Vlad.
1689 2018-05-09 21:05:30 Read somewhere that Saudi Arabia wants to set up huge nuclear power installations with Russia's help prior to oil running out.
1690 2018-05-09 21:05:14 Shale oil and nat gas, here we come!!
1691 2018-05-09 21:04:56 But Hillary's plan to close down fracking, oil on public lands, and coal wouldn't give Putin more market share. At all. Seriously
1692 2018-05-09 21:04:56 Oil. 
1693 2018-05-09 21:04:40 even in Turkey's caves, there is constant electricity, but darkness in the streets of naija, with all our oil money, deres God

1695 2018-05-09 21:04:31 Ma’m when was the last time you changed your oil? Never years ago
1696 2018-05-09 21:04:30 Is it possible that trump's canceling of the Iran agreement is on behest of Putin to artificially raise oil prices to help Russia's struggling economy?
#IranDeal #JCPOA #Trump #RussianCollusion
1697 2018-05-09 21:04:29 If anyone wonders why Iran hates America so much, you should look into it. Fascinating story. Long story short, Iran wanted to nationalize and sell their oil and make money from it. The US said no, overthrew their government, and put a dictator in power who was friendly to us.
1698 2018-05-09 21:04:21 well it's best lukewarm for this. Lukewarm pasta, salted cucumber, cherry tomatoes, feta with herbs, Kalamata olives, tons of garlic, cover with basil and chives, then a bunch of olive oil and white wine vinegar

1700 2018-05-09 21:04:11 That's how the market works, Kurt. When futures speculators see a way to make it go up, it goes up. Storms in the straights, oil goes up. Civil unrest in Slovakia, oil goes up. Pretty much anything happens anywhere that can be loosely tied to oil, oil goes up. Facts do matter.
1701 2018-05-09 21:04:03 @realDonaldTrump so you will ignore oil prices, up over $71 today, gasoline futures up 6 cents in ONE day.
1702 2018-05-09 21:03:55 The interview itself was in Baltimore. At the time, I had decided that hotel rooms were an expense I couldn't really afford so I stayed at a motel 6 that was also a truck stop. The toilet didn't flush and there were actual hookers hanging out in the oddly designed parking lot.

1705 2018-05-09 21:03:18 My car has been too dirty for the gas station car washes to work on it for ages. Today I'm finally going to handwash it so I'm not totally embarrassed by how poorly I take care of it when I bring it in for an oil change...
1706 2018-05-09 21:03:06 Had to go back into work but now I don’t and I had already left the house so I’m getting my oil changed. I know it’s wild, I’m wild wooowee

1712 2018-05-09 21:02:38 Trump’s constituent, Vlad, loves this. Just look how spot oil prices have jumped from $40 a barrel to over $70. The Saudis love this, too.

1714 2018-05-09 21:02:21 No discount. Canadian oil for Canadians. Our proven oil reserves are staggering. Eventually, our exports will subsidize Saudi over flow (barrels prefix).

1721 2018-05-09 21:01:58 If they only had jobs then they wouldn’t kill us infidels. It may seem odd but their job is to kill us. How about Iran using the $B’s that Obozo gave them or that they earn from their oil to develop themselves into a ME manufacturing / economic power? Jobs won’t solve hate. #MAGA

1724 2018-05-09 21:01:33 On behalf of the rest of the world, you’re talking complete bollocks.  Your president and your country is an international laughing stock.  Your president is in Putin’s pocket and oil revenues are the reason for this decision, which favours Russia. The coffee is on, smell it?
1725 2018-05-09 21:01:22 After about a week, I somehow managed to burn out my vocal chords, not from all the drinking but from the nonstop vomiting the morning after. On all tape recordings for the next several months, I sound like Dr Girlfriend from The Venture Brothers.
1726 2018-05-09 21:01:01 So if it can be proven that selling guns is good for the company (and, by extension, shareholders), that would buttress their case, no? 

Seems like our obligation as concerned and engaged citizens is clear here, folks. We need to back up the van and buy all we can.

That’s where he cut off their clothes, sexually
1731 2018-05-09 21:00:39 So people in the oil business needed another run at the bank. Let them have a go at your money for a while and everything fall into place. If not, there's always money to be made in military contracting. Swing with the times my friends, swing with the times.

1736 2018-05-09 21:00:17 United States Oil Fund (USO) price at close, 2018-05-09, is 14.38.
1737 2018-05-09 21:00:15 It’s more of a finishing prep’ than a gunk remover. It’d do the job eventually but costly. The stuff I’m taking off is like rubber fly paper. I think a good soak/scrub with very light oil (and repeat) is the ticket. It’s a track bike. The putty would be a bit rich for it.

I want just ONE president in my lifetime that is competent and not working for special interests.
1743 2018-05-09 20:59:35 I’m getting my oil changed at @TwoRiversFord . No bad days over here. Everyone is always in a good mood.
1744 2018-05-09 20:59:34 Pulling out of Iran deal and driving up oil prices to help Russia IS THE ACTUAL DEFINITION OF TREASON!!! Why is he still in office!!!  Literal treason!!! @POTUS
1745 2018-05-09 20:59:29 Oh that's no biggie, just turn it upside down til it all runs out and fill it with fuel. It'll smoke a bit but it'll be fine. Fuel in the oil bit is more serious...
1746 2018-05-09 20:59:27 If you think oil is the road to recovery I have a coal mine I would like to sell you.  Alberta needs to diversify its economy.  Something the cons failed to do. #cdnpoli #ableg
1747 2018-05-09 20:59:26 I'd been staying on a friend's couch that much. He attended a small college about 2 hours out of Baltimore. While he didn't technically live in a frat house, he did live with 3 other frat guys in a campus suite and they were all in a frat. So it was basically a frat house.
1748 2018-05-09 20:59:23 WH can issue whatever sanctions it wants. Iran will continue to deal with our allies. It can now sell oil to Russia and China. Iran Win.
1749 2018-05-09 20:59:18 My man just took my car to get a oil change and washed while I’m at work 
1750 2018-05-09 20:59:12 Got myself and a handful of clients into oil about 12 months ago because it was too cheap not too and I'm their hero now

1753 2018-05-09 20:59:06 so where do I incorporate the rose hip oil into my skin regimen?

1755 2018-05-09 20:58:58 got so much done today  finished my case, got an oil change, finished some more work, finished another paper. 
1756 2018-05-09 20:58:45 As the us becomes more isolated in foreign policy   Emerging powers in Europe will start trading ps . Most of oil comes from Russia , Middle East and Britain
1757 2018-05-09 20:58:37 Rich in oil apparently. (Tries to unthink certain images... )
1758 2018-05-09 20:58:32 Olive oil. Preferably extra virgin. Just leave it in there for a good 10-15 minutes and then tilt the head over the sink and tweet pics of what comes out
1759 2018-05-09 20:58:32 There goes your tax cut ... middle class....just think....You put sanctions on Iranian oil ...now you have  US...Saudi Arabia...Russia...all big seller's of oil with oil hitting 80-90 dollars a barrel...and Europe and China net importer's... should be interesting
1760 2018-05-09 20:58:24 Oil royalty 20% for Sarawak & Sabah
1761 2018-05-09 20:58:21 Shit ain't even right. I forgot how much oil and butter I used in my cooking. And I ate them for leftovers 
1762 2018-05-09 20:58:20 It clogs your pores/traps dirt. It’s not a good oil for your face.
1763 2018-05-09 20:58:18 If you're out of shaving cream, use olive oil. It works just as good, if not better.
1764 2018-05-09 20:58:14 リプのツリーだいたい見たがやべーな
1765 2018-05-09 20:58:14 I can’t believe how easy it is to get my oil changed. I should start doing that more than once a year 
1766 2018-05-09 20:58:11 Maybe it was never about the nukes, but a way to open up more markets through Iran. Commercially (like Boeing), but also Iran oil and US arms. We have to follow the money, its always some sort of military contract deal w/ the middle east.
1767 2018-05-09 20:58:09 found an oil change for 55... shout out to coupons
1768 2018-05-09 20:58:09 Hey Deplorables!  Has the rise in gasoline due to Trump's disastrous economic policies hit you yet?  Whatever tax gains you expect to see are going right into your gas tank and into the pockets of Russia via higher oil prices. Oh, and good luck paying the increases in healthcare.

1772 2018-05-09 20:57:48 Put a few drops of olive oil in and lay on your side. Let it soak in. Do that for a few nights until the wax softens up and it should start to drain out on its own. (Yes, it's gross.) If it doesn't drain on its own, your doctor can shoot it out once it's softened!
1773 2018-05-09 20:57:46 My question is did Donald Trump pull out of the Iran deal so that oil prices would go up for his rich friends? I think someone needs to see if he received some money in the last few weeks from oil companies!!!
1774 2018-05-09 20:57:31 Reality check: NATO more secure now that other members have upped contribution, JCPOA was unsigned & unenforceable, China wants to reduce US trade deficit,, US credibility high as NorKs seek peace, US near oil self-sufficiency, "muh Russians" a Democrat paid Russian sourced joke.
1775 2018-05-09 20:57:16 That's because his globalist friends that profited off of Iran's oil is no longer getting that $$$.
1776 2018-05-09 20:57:15 Tell him Americans LOVE their public lands, thus the crowded National Parks! We need MORE land to recreate on,more National Monuments.Tell him regular folks, unlike his oil and gas buddies,hate what he is doing to Bears Ears & GrandStaircase. BTW, thanks for standing up to Trump!
1777 2018-05-09 20:57:10 @elonmusk @realDonaldTrump help us we can’t get oil from Iran so @Tesla @Gigafactory1 @TheBoringComp south Africa  need elrctric need power need transport need energy need hyperloop across Africa fir product and power distribution

1780 2018-05-09 20:57:00 By killing the Iran deal Trump has ramped the oil price and paid back the millions he owes the oligarchs
1781 2018-05-09 20:56:56 Expected more of an uptick than we got at $71 oil.

1787 2018-05-09 20:56:22 Sadly it’s Pilot Oil.  They are good at making money but bad at football.
1788 2018-05-09 20:56:19 And it is very good for Russia. Oil prices just went up them!
1789 2018-05-09 20:56:17 Why would they continue doing that, beats me, the only thing Iran has is lots of oil and since it's a fungible commodity they can obtain it from another provider (Like Bahrein which recently discovered a new huge reserve) It's not worth supporting the #NukeCaliphate. #NoDeal
1790 2018-05-09 20:56:17 Oil McBurnie scoring 30 goals, can already see it
1791 2018-05-09 20:56:05 Actually the entire world does.  Oil like money makes the world go round
1792 2018-05-09 20:56:02 Can't believe I missed the oil trades tho. They were all on watch and technicals lined up, but I didnt' move bc concern over market volatility.  It was pretty much all a defensive rotation amidst the sell off.  Lessons learned
1793 2018-05-09 20:56:00 Brian was the first interview that I didn't feel entirely terrible about. The first three had their ups and downs but I left that one feeling really good about it. It was March 2013.

1795 2018-05-09 20:55:49 The United Steelworkers (USW) said today that while it will continue to review the details, it supports a deal brokered by the President that appears to address the long-running conflict between ethanol producers and oil refiners over federal biofuels mandates.

1801 2018-05-09 20:55:08 Have you tried a sugar rub? I mix sugar and olive oil, then gently exfoliate my hands. Don't rub them for more than 2 minutes, then wash well, put on hydro cream, and if you have them, light cotton gloves. After about two hours, put a lotion like Eucerin on. That helps me.

Oil touched the highest since 2014 today with WTI hitting $71.17. Brent also exploded higher, hitting $76.08.
1805 2018-05-09 20:54:47 In a society where individual citizens' rights are not respected and there is not protection against lunatics getting total control over laws,the military and the natural  resources(like oil), it will end up like #Venezuela, state ownership invites rampant political corruption..

1822 2018-05-09 20:53:25 Is $100 oil plausible in the future? Assuming inventories will continue to draw at the average pace of 2018, WTI will reach $100 in ~40 weeks. Assuming inventories will continue to draw at the same pace it did this week, WTI will reach $100 in ~10 weeks. You be the judge #OOTT

1824 2018-05-09 20:53:17 @wrightr Liked your article. Isn't there also a benefit to Russia's oil sales that took a beating in the drop in oil prices. Will the cut in supply of world oil be made up with more Russian sales at a higher price. Another gift for VP?
1825 2018-05-09 20:52:59 So you live in my area. I'd like to get in touch. Trying to find people to go meet with #Trump & who he put in charge. I wish medical marijuana work for me. I'm glad it does help some parents. The oil, I can't afford. If it worked it probably wouldn't work for some of my pain.
1826 2018-05-09 20:52:48 I get excited for oil changes, it’s like my whole car is new. (It’s not.)

1838 2018-05-09 20:51:26 They stopped our drilling for the same reason they closed the coal mines. The globalist wanted to crush us and sold us out. Oil drilling equip is returning to America. Evil is losing and someday is now here. Trump is #MAGA ! Have faith My friends!

1844 2018-05-09 20:51:03 Could it be seen as paying back the Russians? The inevitable increase in price of oil improves their economy massively right?
1845 2018-05-09 20:50:57 Just a coincidence that stopping Iran from selling oil would make oil more expensive, and more profitable, for remaining oil exporters such as... Russia.

1883 2018-05-09 20:47:03 There's a really interesting question here about how much of this is just Kabuki. Like every other teacher pension system in the country, there are some teensy funding and ROI problems that make divestment of a profitable industry unlikely.
1884 2018-05-09 20:46:59 And trump just drove up oil/chemicals and steel prices.
"making america great again" on the backs of US and Canadian farmers.
At least China's crop sanctions won't hurt Canada.
1885 2018-05-09 20:46:58 But you make a good point, we need to build more and I believe that will happen under Trump. He rolled back all but 7 of 200 new regulations put on the oil industry by Obama.
1886 2018-05-09 20:46:57 What do you think Iran is going to turn into? Enjoy $100/barrel oil and surging gas prices. It’s almost as if we are literally reliving the Bush II presidency all over again.

Do u think it's immoral for radical Muslims to behead people, set them on fire, lower them into hot oil?
1889 2018-05-09 20:46:42 I've gotten too old to remember whether I'm supposed to buy SuperFlo, Quaker State or Valvoline to line Rick's pockets. Would be much easier if you guys just used official oil of NASCAR instead of constantly whoring a new deal.
1890 2018-05-09 20:46:37 Take a look at oil and get back to me. They NEEDED this to boost their shit economy. It’s about the money.
1891 2018-05-09 20:46:33 Great! Now we need an ethics complaint against @WolfForPA for denying people like Ray Kemble rights to clean water under Title 58 §3218 of the Oil and Gas Act. @JoshShapiroPA what's your excuse?

This is pretty much common knowledge for anyone with a pulse- there is a lot more to the story but you didn't find some deeply hidden artifact. It's called history, maybe read more.
1897 2018-05-09 20:46:12 Data new OIL they say.
1898 2018-05-09 20:46:10 Bush crashed our economy and started an illigitimate war in an attempt to procure foreign oil to pay off his friends at the oil companies. I blane him for those if thats what you mean.
1899 2018-05-09 20:46:01 You do realize Russia is under sanctions and they are an ally of Iran. The only countries that wanted Iran deal to be scrapped were Arab gulf states (oil exporters) and Israel's warmongering.

1901 2018-05-09 20:45:50 Have you noticed that oil is soaring up for Trump and his rich friends now that he pulled out of the Iran Deal.  Where does that leave us American consumers?
1902 2018-05-09 20:45:47 Damnit - I just realized that Oil is one of the few things that makes sense for intelligent species to fight over in space - since it needs a strong carbon cycle which doesn't happen without something absorbing fucktonnes of carbon - like say, carbon based life
1903 2018-05-09 20:45:47 Mixed bag to be honest. Copper yes. Others like nickel/ali/zinc were flat. Oil & steel actually moved higher over that period. Nevertheless, the point was that SK exports are no the Hindenburg omen.

1907 2018-05-09 20:45:25 Oil prices heading for $80 which triggered the last financial crisis ... USA looks like it’s preparing for war with Iran which will send oil prices soaring ... Syria and Iraq and Libya a total mess and full of terrorists ... all feels a bit chaotic ...
1908 2018-05-09 20:45:24 US is also vying to be in the race for being primary supplier of oil.

1919 2018-05-09 20:44:12 Not cheap for sure.  Over $2600/year for Tayla’s Cannabis oil at her small dose.  Adult dose would be close to $5000/year I would think...
1920 2018-05-09 20:44:09 no, olive oil is fruit juice. science tells us this.

1929 2018-05-09 20:43:31 If I were looking to get away from the USD being the global reserve currency, could I have made a better move than to force a relatively minor (but significant) oil exporter off the USD system via sanctions, so that China could start testing their system at scale?

1966 2018-05-09 20:38:58 A large refinery in the US runs about 400kbd. How many do you think 17M barrels would feed? Oil companies want to keep what they get out of the ground as provable reserves which raises their share price. You want market balance, not independent US hydrocarbon energy.

1968 2018-05-09 20:38:48 The entire point of Trump’s policy of approving oil pipelines and expanding drilling is to make the US no longer reliant on stupid petro/terrorist countries that try and hold that over our head - removes their leverage
1969 2018-05-09 20:38:46 1. Trump backs out of Iran nuclear deal and threatens sanctions. 

2. Price of crude oil jumps way up. 

3. Companies like Exxon are raking in cash due to their stocks jumping. 

4. Us peasents pay more for a necessity. 

Do you guys fucking get it yet? They are vampires.

2036 2018-05-09 20:31:49 Well, I am in the oil business. The main reason gas prices are rising is because there has been speculation of instability in areas like the Hormuz strait where 17M barrels of oil move through per day heading west. How many US refineries do you think that feeds?
2037 2018-05-09 20:31:49 I grew up there. I taught philosophy one summer during grad school more than 2 decades ago. I won't go back. It's Mississippi with oil.
2038 2018-05-09 20:31:47 Heck yeah! Or at least a fancy oil change :)
2039 2018-05-09 20:31:46 Juveniles working 12-14 hours mining for coal and drilling for oil.  I think @POTUS son Barron should be the First in line! Ass. Whole.

2042 2018-05-09 20:31:40 That oil stuff is a turn off for me though. Take the titty pics fresh out the shower, or at anytime provided they are dry. Oil is a no no.

2045 2018-05-09 20:31:31 Russia an China will gladly buy Iran's oil mean while US citizens  will pay much more for fuel. The elite are tired  of all the peons  clogging  up the road ways 
2046 2018-05-09 20:31:27 Hey Ethereum is the new oil, what are u talking about.  We discovered new oil
2047 2018-05-09 20:31:20 Oil price already rising. Good for some companies and billionaires, bad for the rest of the world, including Trumps base.

2050 2018-05-09 20:30:56 Had been wondering about Trump’s motives in Iran and then read about oil prices rising as a result of reimposed sanctions and it all makes sense...
2051 2018-05-09 20:30:49 Iran sits on an ocean of oil and gas.

Idiotic to support their nuke program.
2052 2018-05-09 20:30:47 Today in Irony™: I went to drive @baewalshy to retrieve his car from an oil change and on the way there my car threw a dash message "CHANGE OIL IMMEDIATELY" so now we are waiting for someone to pick us up from Walmart Auto so we can get his car 
2053 2018-05-09 20:30:47 I don't have a problem with oil companies getting $. More power to anyone that can get it.

I look forward to the CPC blaming the Liberals

2059 2018-05-09 20:30:21 Oil and water science fun !!
2060 2018-05-09 20:30:18 Free oil change 
2061 2018-05-09 20:30:10 Jesus Christ I have to watch hgtv while I wait for my car's oil to be changed. These people who can't be over 30 just bought a 700k house. BULLSHIT.
2062 2018-05-09 20:29:59 600 barrels of crude 90,000 barrels of toxic brine (water) Show me where he says 90,000 barrels of oil please and he's not a bot, he's a person.
2063 2018-05-09 20:29:59 Yo these two ugly as females in class started laughing about my speech about deforestation and palm oil. These bitches don’t deserve air!
2064 2018-05-09 20:29:54 And how about those damn Russian sanctions?! No collusion, eh? And with the Iranian sanctions put into play, again, only the rich get richer as oil will now surge. Maybe it'll be just a coincidence, maybe not. Regardless, it'll be a rough ride. #BigOil #RussianCollusion.
2065 2018-05-09 20:29:48 So the hit list story of independent oil rich countries is true. Iran was one of them & now   #Trump is taking special care of it!
2066 2018-05-09 20:29:35 tapi masalahnya ink dekat jari ni buatkan jari aku kering nak mampus.tegang je pulak tu.nak aku sapu argan oil berapa kali.hisyyy
2067 2018-05-09 20:29:34 The former U.S. allies can use the Iranian oil, and will keep buying it. Oh, and Airbus will sell them airplanes. Too bad for Boeing.
2068 2018-05-09 20:29:30 I have before but the analogs break fast, they suck. But it's just a preference tbh. After you play for awhile the analogs will always be moving ur character forward and you can't stop it unless you take it apart and oil it .
2069 2018-05-09 20:29:28 It hurts me when I neglect my car, I legit feel bad that it's low on oil
2070 2018-05-09 20:29:27 You know this state has more than oil in it right Chris?
2071 2018-05-09 20:29:23 Ah, I see. Thought it had a cap as well. How is their oil price hedge structured?
2072 2018-05-09 20:29:18 In this way you @realDonaldTrump  help Putin up oil prices. 
It is russians said they will nuck attack US cities.
2073 2018-05-09 20:29:16 @jimcramer @MadMoneyOnCNBC just covered in oil 
2074 2018-05-09 20:29:04 I'm also curious about this. I may PM him later. I still would love to chat some MacroEcon :)
2075 2018-05-09 20:29:04 My car is getting an oil change rn tho. Lol. It was due one about 1,500 miles ago
2076 2018-05-09 20:29:01 passing tru couva & see a young lady clad in one a dem orange oil field overalls jump in her A6 with her lunch and press out. what a queen.
2077 2018-05-09 20:28:52 And now we know who really wanted this agreement to get torn up. Oil companies - specifically Russian ones, but maybe others.
2078 2018-05-09 20:28:52 Ayn Rand -> humor = oil -> water. Although she did crack a few jokes during one of her Phil Donahue appearances.
2079 2018-05-09 20:28:50 Israeli Amb to US: We’re grateful to Potus for ending Iran deal. Millions of dollars were pouring to Iranian coffers. Now, trajectory changes for entire M East. Pres has power to bring others to his side. Iran oil $ was going into their war machine. Sanctions will restrict this
2080 2018-05-09 20:28:49 He’s gonna be paying a helluva lot of money for gas on trips to the border and back from Georgia with oil and gas prices surging. Good thing the Persian Gulf hasn’t been thrust back into crisis and the president stands up to OPEC members like Saudi Ara... wait a sec... #%&#!!!
2081 2018-05-09 20:28:46 Iran treaty pullout just a Trump ploy to line Putin’s pockets with more oil revenue.  Why has no one written of this??   I despair of the stupidity of media even ostensibly intellectual liberal media.  Get your shit together
2082 2018-05-09 20:28:36 Has she ever been right about anything?
2083 2018-05-09 20:28:34 Economy goin fine & hope it continues but can see storm clouds on horizon from rising Oil prices & t-Bill yields to growing comm. retail vacancies/b'ruptcies, savings rate @ 1 of 3 lowest on record; m'facturing productivity LOW & corp debt rollovers rising (@ higher ntrest rates)
2084 2018-05-09 20:28:32 I had to look that up.

Both interesting and insulting.
2085 2018-05-09 20:28:29 Maybe we should ask @oilfractals this in private @Oil_Tradr. There are trolls around, and Madani and company definitely watches us for any moment to send more trolls (since we probably make his job of narrative pushing/control harder).
2086 2018-05-09 20:28:14 100% agree with this. We should be taxing their dirty oil. Not our own. There is much bigger people pulling the strings that live seeing Canadas energy sector down. Meanwhhile they are buying up shares.
2087 2018-05-09 20:28:11 And it will develop an oil leak which cannot be traced.
2088 2018-05-09 20:27:56 It's also a way to get Putin some oil money since he couldn't get Roseneft through.
2089 2018-05-09 20:27:54 Mine knocked on thicccc ass oil 
2090 2018-05-09 20:27:52 Pump oil...lower price...that will show the world
2091 2018-05-09 20:27:48 This mf work at a real ass Firestone and ain’t offered no oil change or tires or anything tf are friends for
2092 2018-05-09 20:27:48 Fucked around and had too much of the oil in my lunch break and I didn't mean to! Now I'm going thru it at my work desk
2093 2018-05-09 20:27:43 And even with that "winning streak" the DOW is down about 2000 points from where it was when they passed the Tax Cuts. While oil has climbed from 46 dollars a barrel to 77.25 (brent crude) in the last 12 months.
2094 2018-05-09 20:27:40 Oil check?
2095 2018-05-09 20:27:39 My friend, the oil money buying their humanity,
2096 2018-05-09 20:27:28 Or avocado toast drizzled with some kind of oil
2097 2018-05-09 20:27:26 it will end up like this:

can we get the same or better return by divesting from these groups? 

if yes -> divest
if no -> bury your head in the sand, yell about how the system is rigged, continue to make money for retirement
2098 2018-05-09 20:27:26 Love your analogy:‘Morrison & Turnbull slipperier than two eels covered in oil’ sums them up perfectly!
2099 2018-05-09 20:27:23 I owe about a grand to EON cause we had no insulation during the winter and now the landlords finally put some in, its not just the coconut oil that's fucking melting 
2100 2018-05-09 20:27:16 The smell of truffle oil is just 
2101 2018-05-09 20:27:16 Try this salad: All the greens (I used chard, kale, spinach, and arugula), parsley, cilantro, quinoa, black beans, roasted broccolini, roasted sweet potatoes, pesto, oil and vinegar, cucumber, chia seeds, sunflower seeds, and avocado. 
2102 2018-05-09 20:27:12 You have no problem with Trump pulling out of the Iran agreement to raise oil prices for Russia which is a terrorist supporting country.
2103 2018-05-09 20:27:02 I thought we invaded Kuwait then Afghanistan then Iraq then Libya then stayed in Iraq so we could have cheap oil. 
Still waiting on that ...
2104 2018-05-09 20:26:44 THERES PLENTY OF OYHER PLACES TO BUY OIL ,EVERYONE SHOULD BOYCOTT IRANS OIL ,SAUDI OIL IS JUST WAITING ,FRIENDS
2105 2018-05-09 20:26:22 Anyway but in the markets today, was a good day, specially for oil.

@realDonaldTrump pulling out of the Iran Deal, has put in question the oil supply!
2106 2018-05-09 20:26:21 I need a woman that I can talk to for hours about oil prices. That is not too much to ask.
2107 2018-05-09 20:26:20 No edit button.. We miss your smile in Oil Country, not sayin you havnt smiled since
2108 2018-05-09 20:26:19 lol, they had to sell the renewables because their oil assets are worthless.
2109 2018-05-09 20:26:13 I'm not in the oil business, but I have a memory good enough to know every summer gas prices are raised  due to a slowing in production and it being "driving season" and that the current prices are not even close to a record.
2110 2018-05-09 20:26:11 Should have poured a gallon of Duckhams Q 20/50 motor oil over Alex. Oil repels water. Dryness is the absence of water. #taskmaster
2111 2018-05-09 20:26:04 Oil soars after Trump nixes Iran nuclear deal, e/us-global-markets/oil-soars-as-trump-dumps-iran-nuclear-deal-dollar-dips-idUSKBN1IA064
2112 2018-05-09 20:25:50 But when it comes to your Passat VW gas emissions scam you guys weren't eager to listen. Lol. Tried to blame everyone but yourselves. Germany only cares about getting some more oil from iran and appeasing the Iranian supreme leader aka Hitler.
2113 2018-05-09 20:25:50 lol, they had to sell the renewables because their oil assets are worthless.
2114 2018-05-09 20:25:32 He didn't campaign on "no war," he even said we should have "taken the oil" if we were spend all that money in Iraq. Destabilization was what he was against. So his bombing the F out of ISIS and trying to help stabilize what has been torn apart is not quite neocon agenda, IMO
2115 2018-05-09 20:25:27 Skord hands down has the best flower in Vancouver and I just bought their oil and I’m SO excited
2116 2018-05-09 20:25:25 Oil prices surged as Lebanon began struggling to reduce its Public debts($82 bl) and Treasury deficit($ 6 bl this year).This will inevitably drive the deficit upwards more so that Treasury continues to pay EDL imported fuel invoice.Hence the need to enforce urgent austerity plan
2117 2018-05-09 20:25:25 I hate how people think Man City is a big club. Teams like Liverpool, Man United and Arsenal they earned their success. As for Man City they bought their success just like Chelsea. Man City and Chelsea would be in the championship if it wasn't for oil money
2118 2018-05-09 20:25:24 "It's really simple. You just have to keep the water from leaching into the oil. It lowers the temperature." A stream of water droplets leap out of the fryer and aggregate into a cloud above her head. "It's not that hard."
2119 2018-05-09 20:25:20 OIL!!! Not ripping!!! Just rub oil and micellar water on them and they slide right off.
2120 2018-05-09 20:25:06 GREAT NEWS FOR CHINA & Russia can build up to90% of those planes w NO US parts so Canada may behappy w oil prices BUT NAFTA negotiating remains an exercise in futility..probably. but Russia will be so happy! Poor sod Hes showing ignorance on global politics & unintended outcomes
2121 2018-05-09 20:25:00 Some one should have came with me to get my oil changed 
2122 2018-05-09 20:24:50 Good thing we didn't start a trade war with one of the top two buyers of Iranian crude oil…
2123 2018-05-09 20:24:47 #Graze's fries are made from fresh cut Kennebec potatoes, twice-fried Belgian-style in Non-GMO rice bran oil and seasoned with kosher salt.
2124 2018-05-09 20:24:43 Oh they know. They don’t care. “Journalism”
2125 2018-05-09 20:24:40 Start with chopped shallots or small onion softened in butter & oil then add curry pdr  for 3-4 mins & cooked rice  I cook the smoked haddock in the microwave  slathered in butter then 3- 4 mins on medium depending on thickness  then tip juices into rice together with flaked fish
2126 2018-05-09 20:24:38 Remembering the times when we used to burn the midnight oil with my friend Mduduzi Dhladhla, #priceless_moments — feeling inspired
2127 2018-05-09 20:24:29 They've taken $100 Bn of their own money back  blocked under sanctions, that's one hell of an incentive for future compliance and they have doubled their Oil exports. There's a distinct pattern to Trump's rhetoric. Note the EU Steel and Al tariffs - rolled back. Dangerous game.

2132 2018-05-09 20:23:50 Trump breaks the Iran deal. Oil prices go up. Who benefits? Russia as much or more than any country on earth. Makes you think.
2133 2018-05-09 20:23:30 Lol, that tweet lets me know you don’t understand the oil business. You literally posted a story about current record setting oil production AS GAS PRICES RISE IN THE COUNTRY OF PRODUCTION! You sound like a wildcatter who watches too much Fox.
2134 2018-05-09 20:23:21 Environmental stories are hard to keep going unless it’s an oil leak, explosion
2135 2018-05-09 20:23:13 Trump imposing sanctions on Iran will give Saudi Arabia and even bigger market share in global oil trade. Remember that, because Trump's stated motives for his decision are all pretty much fabrications.
2136 2018-05-09 20:22:46 I see, thank you for the explanation, I’ll have to re read that a few tones to understand it fully . If you don’t mind me asking do you still have your shorts from last year too?
2137 2018-05-09 20:22:39 pissed oil heater makes you impaired
2138 2018-05-09 20:22:26 They look like miniature oil bottles. How apt...
2139 2018-05-09 20:22:24 ...the underlying susceptibility is of main interest. We need people with no burning and only mild occasional erythema (i.e. not exceeding reasonable UV dose) - in people with no sugar/refined carb/veg oil consumption - then we get to see what's going on with the interacting sun.
2140 2018-05-09 20:22:17 And Trump is nothing but a snake oil salesman. You like the snake oil but you don't like the snake.
2141 2018-05-09 20:22:17 Why $90 #Oil soon

USA will have to import on average at least 8mmbls/d to keep crude slate heavy enough to run all the light shale coming out of the ground.  Even if exports avg 2mmbls/d all year USA market will be over supplied by 200kbbls/d if E&P flat here

Wt matters
2142 2018-05-09 20:22:16 I would only gift coconut oil to someone that I disliked.

they cant even change the oil in their Abrams tanks alone
2144 2018-05-09 20:22:14 I thought that was just the oil revenue? Is that ALL the revenue that Scotland actually raises? Whoooaaaa... Something SERIOUSLY WRONG with this picture!! 
2145 2018-05-09 20:22:12 The other day martin told me to take off my cloths and lay down, so I did. Nigga gave me a full body oil massage it was amazing
2146 2018-05-09 20:21:52 What a laugh. You Trumpanzees continuously put your ideological addiction ahead of the nation.
Jobs will be lost as Iran cancels deal with Boeing. Oil prices will rise which will be great for Russia and the Russians are now free to sell Iran all they need for nukes
Putin puppets!
2147 2018-05-09 20:21:48 : bath bomb esp. for expecting moms.. consists of usual base ingredients + chamomile (leaf & oil), lavender (petals & essential oil), plantain leaf, & manuka honey. A swirl of lavender & pale yellow in color. All ingredients are safe during pregnancy! Named “Mommy to BEE” 
2148 2018-05-09 20:21:19 Why facts matter. Trump breaks Iran deal, stocks go up. Should Trump voters celebrate?

No. Dow went up because energy stocks went up. Energy stocks went up cause oil prices went up a lot. Rich did well. People who need to fill their car with gas will soon suffer. Facts matter.
2149 2018-05-09 20:21:16 The Dow up 182; Nasdaq, 73; and the S&P, 26.  Only red on the screen were the Dow Utes. Breadth 1.6 and 2.2 to 1. VIX declined for the 5th straight day to under 14. Dark clouds? Oil over $71/bbl, and the10-year over 3%.

2153 2018-05-09 20:21:02 Trump bailing on the Iran deal will boost oil and gas prices. Democrats now need to hammer that fact, that simple message, home to voters.
2154 2018-05-09 20:20:46 Helps get smooth and oil free skin: Beat one egg-white until stiff w/ lemon juice. Apply on your skin for 20 mins. Rinse w/ lukewarm water.
2155 2018-05-09 20:20:44 Everyone with a functioning brain understands that pulling out of the Iran deal has nothing to do with terrorism, nuclear bombs or any other fairytale propagated by U.S. neocons. This is simply about key strategic region sitting on massive oil reserves KRIEGER
2156 2018-05-09 20:20:43 @masterclass How about an Oil Painting class?
2157 2018-05-09 20:20:42 Then once he screws up the economy via trade balance (trade wars), spiking oil (Iran deal), and a number of other bad policy decisions - we can look forward to a boost in defaults as well. Perfect.
2158 2018-05-09 20:20:42 AFTERNOON MARKET WATCH: US stocks close higher as soaring oil prices lift energy stocks. Dow jumps 183 points. S&P 500 and Nasdaq advance 1%. ExxonMobil and Chevron gain 2%. Crude oil surges 3% to $71.14 a barrel. ~ M

2165 2018-05-09 20:20:06 They need to take it seriously - it could severely affect their olive oil production. You on holiday?
2166 2018-05-09 20:20:05 Seriously bitches stay talking about natural skin this but look like they slobbered mad baby oil on their face mad greasy
2167 2018-05-09 20:20:04 I have a separate set of holes for skeet, oil, lighter fluid and defensive ink.
2168 2018-05-09 20:20:03 Trump supporters only burn bridges - why waste the calories building them.  Instead, building an atoll surrounded by oil rigs in the Barents sea might be a fitting home for them.
2169 2018-05-09 20:20:00 Wow. Pretty sure our governments position has always been to prevent any other country from gaining nukes. More evidence our officials are in bed with the Saudi’s for their oil. Disgraceful
2170 2018-05-09 20:20:00 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
2171 2018-05-09 20:19:58 I cannot bear  hypocrisy ,
for me it is harder to digest,
as potatoes fried in rancid, old oil....

2174 2018-05-09 20:19:37 I just wanted an oil change
2175 2018-05-09 20:19:36 We are already up to $3 where I live, I am banking on $5 by end of summer, not to mention costs of home heating oil.
2176 2018-05-09 20:19:33 Please provide evidence of increased consumption of oil in the Lower Mainland. This does not address #FirstNations rights over their traditional territories. #cdnpoli
2177 2018-05-09 20:19:31 World stocks generally higher: US +1%; Europe +.6%. Investors overcame their inflation fears,10-year T-Note cracking 3% & Iran uncertainty to push stocks higher. Took solid rise in oil prices as a + even though could stoke inflation. 2018 still a good bet for a positive year.
2178 2018-05-09 20:19:29 Welp. Now is the time to invest in oil stock and defense contracting companies. It was inevitable that Trump would drag us into rising costs and deteorating relationships with the rest of the world, including our allies.
2179 2018-05-09 20:19:26 It's kind of funny. sanctions on Venezuela oil sanctions on Russia oil now sanctions on Iranian oil what's next.. they won't even let Libya produce any oil and measly 400 thousand barrels a day..lol
2180 2018-05-09 20:19:19 Probably oil
2181 2018-05-09 20:19:17 Blocks pores like a mf!!! I'll never forget when I tried it on my hair in undergrad. Come and see dryness. The oil literally just rolled off my head. Hair was so sticky and nasty.
2182 2018-05-09 20:19:11 Could it possibly be because of the fact that their hedging is effective? As far as I understand, a hedge is put in place to limit the upside and downside of fluctuations in the hedged item (oil).

2185 2018-05-09 20:18:53 When I get like that I play with a new media. Like if you're painting all the time try playing around with polymer clay, jewelery or markers. If you use pencil and ink, try dip pens and crayons.(Or oil pastels and charcoal)there's lots of stuff out there to help with art an slump
2186 2018-05-09 20:18:44 Orrrrrr you could try my handmade lotions that are 80% oil 20%herbal infusion/distillate I currently make hemp lotion made with homemade hemp milk though
2187 2018-05-09 20:18:39 I don't see much about fracking there. 

They say 'oil spills are bad things'. 'Equipment failure is not good' etc. 

All of which are likely true.

But nothing about actual fracking that makes it especially hazardous.

Please explain.
2188 2018-05-09 20:18:23 Exactly it would be like water & oil. And nobody wants that. I love not Marvel & DC for different reasons, I relate to Marvel characters more & I like DC characters because they’re larger than life

2195 2018-05-09 20:17:39 rosehip oil smells like ass if this doesnt make me look like a neonate im gonna be PISSED
2196 2018-05-09 20:17:35 Now that Iran's oil production is no longer in play, we have some gains in cost of oil. Just basic supply and demand at work. So if you have oil stocks this is good...but you will see a little surprise at the gas pump.
2197 2018-05-09 20:17:32 When Russia faced sanctions, they dumped all of their resources into producing oil. Then the price of oil crashed, decimating their economy. Russia desperately needs the price of oil to rise. Thus, Trump and Iran.
2198 2018-05-09 20:17:27 But it's a weapon of war... Because we, the most powerful nation in the world, send our troops into war with a one pull one round semi automatic weapon.  By that logic my weiner is a weapon of war.. One pull one shot... (GRIN)
2199 2018-05-09 20:17:24 i was gonna be twee this year but it's already may and i'm still wearing these jeans with oil(?) stains and a paint stain that looks like fucking mustard but it's actually paint

2234 2018-05-09 20:14:42 CBD is almost half a derivative of from the cannabis hemp plants. Weed isn’t legal here in my state. All 49 states CBD oil is legal to have and use. Not sure about 1 state .  Doesn’t make sense. Maybe Hawaii? Where are you from?
2235 2018-05-09 20:14:36 Environmental PROTECTION Agency. Think you are forgetting the purpose of the agency you lead. Also you work for all Americans not just the mine owners, oil companies, and other industries that are abusing the environment!

2239 2018-05-09 20:14:18 That's easy. Put sanctions on Saudi. It won't last a month without oil revenues.
2240 2018-05-09 20:14:17 Yeah, watch gas prices sky rocket, since we won't be getting any oil from Iran anymore.  Then watch all trumpsters bellyache.
2241 2018-05-09 20:14:09 Instead of focusing on the nuclear aspect, people should rather look on the long run at gas and oil prices. Further sanctions on Iran will freeze ongoing projects (european companies included) and prices will blaze. Ready for the next oil crisis?
2242 2018-05-09 20:14:01 honestly im still on the hunt for one that works amazing, i think you get the best results when you make them from scratch (aloe, avacado & olive oil blended together make a rlly good one) Eggs are another really good protein for your hair but u know me.... vegan lol

2253 2018-05-09 20:12:48 Thank you. I am also wondering how long it would take to remediate the oil out of the mud. Oil & sheens could reduce/kill slime layer & disrupt feeding of shorebirds. Missing a couple of migration feed cycles will severely stress & weaken birds. We have extensive mudflats here.
2254 2018-05-09 20:12:31 At Glockner getting my oil changed. I’ve spent so much time planting my flowers this week that I’m thinking of plant food for dinner . . .
2255 2018-05-09 20:12:30 Nobody knows why markets move, oil prices depress consumption too. Had the market dropped, that would be the argument
2256 2018-05-09 20:12:18 We don’t need their oil, and we don’t need the to import any either.
2257 2018-05-09 20:12:15 2.The moment US pulled out of Iran deal, price of oil rachets upwards, stock market rises too. Don't be stupid. Disintegration Iran nuclear deal adds huge wealth to the oligarchy/billionaires who bought & sold the future of our country by placing it in the hands of tRump.

2259 2018-05-09 20:12:07 On reflection: If the CIA hadn't organized a military coup against Iran's PM in 1953 (becuz he nationalized Iran's oil), and installed the tyrannical western puppet, Pahlavi... extremists like Ayatollah Khomeini would have died in exile.
2260 2018-05-09 20:12:01 develop oil for their needs. That's why they had to change the gear box to cover the performance  (force, heating, rpm, etc) not to have extensive wear. The engine a bit influenced the performance and the balance of the car.

2262 2018-05-09 20:11:54 Iran's revolution that took U.S. Embassy hostages, was blowback from the CIA-backed 1953 coup against democratically-elected Mossedeh, and the installation of the Shah; high percentage of oil profits went to BP and the U.S. Iran supports the Palestinians living in occupation.

2275 2018-05-09 20:09:39 That's easy.  If the coastal parishes would quit suing every oil co that's ever done business there, cos would start drilling again.

2280 2018-05-09 20:09:08 Correct , eu started the Ukraine crisis ,they applied sanctions on Russia costing us 100s of billions each yr . Then Germany and France instead of negotiating minisk cut deals for oil screwing us and Ukraine with norstream . They out five bil. Suck it up or lose US markets .

2296 2018-05-09 20:07:30 of using 4 engines per season & taking penalty later in the season. This allows them using more power output with their oil cheats. Also, from this season the changes of oil spec is further restricted, so Mercedes had a choice to pick something they know. They needed a time to

2303 2018-05-09 20:06:30 Getting my car’s first oil change. It’s weird not being at the Ford dealership and not having them get excited over my last name. 
2304 2018-05-09 20:06:28 Now Trump's Russian masters and Big Oil donors will reap the benefits of surging oil prices & stick it to the public.

2307 2018-05-09 20:06:20 You too are brainwashed in your thinking 
It’s nearly 130 years since oil started flowing from the ground for vehicles to run on
People die later in life aswel
There have been more cars made since 1960’s that have caused this problem
It is you who own cars that is killing people

2310 2018-05-09 20:06:15 Lynn, I did all this research over many years, trust me. Been there, done that, still do. I know a lot about nutrition. I even take forms of B Vits to fit my genetic profile. I take magnesium, zinc, fish oil with the right DHA/EPA ration, etc. NOTHING works like my meds!
2311 2018-05-09 20:06:13 Mega banks are supplying lines of credit to insolvent Intermediaries which are forced to buy oil. Vitol is the worst insolvent, followed by Gunvor and glencore.
2312 2018-05-09 20:06:12 I'd like to hear his take on kenyas prospect with oil in Turkana
2313 2018-05-09 20:05:56 US stocks close higher as soaring oil prices lift energy stocks. Dow jumps 183 points. S&P 500 and Nasdaq advance 1%. ExxonMobil and Chevron gain 2%. Crude oil surges 3% to $71.14 a barrel.

2317 2018-05-09 20:05:11 Iran would not be our enemy had it not been for a CIA-led coup in 1953, in which Prime Minister Mossadeq, a man who had sought to nationalize Iran's oil industry, was replaced with the Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlevi. A revolution ensued leaving Iranians with a sour taste for the US.
2318 2018-05-09 20:05:10 Iran Deal is a distraction - Israel's Manifest Destiny (which is actually ROTchild's ) is ploughing ahead. Dem/Lib outrage to DJT's decision is a 'dog & pony show'. At day's end, Israel will have it's way - minerals, oil, domination, etc in Syria, Iran, Lebanon, et al & the USA
2319 2018-05-09 20:05:00 And if you’re keeping track, the price of oil has increased by 17% this year, while the Canadian energy sector is up roughly 2%
2320 2018-05-09 20:04:59 Clearly, last sentence removes you from being an unbiased and objective voice. We all make overly broad observances on occasion. This one?
2321 2018-05-09 20:04:54 Stocks ending with solid gains as oil soars, which is boosting energy Stocks and the broader market. Dow +183 points at the close.

2324 2018-05-09 20:04:43 The oil channel long is very strong, with many levels of support. With that said $72ish will put us at the very top of that channel which would make is due for a pullback. But all pullbacks are buys until channel breaks

2326 2018-05-09 20:04:38 The USA is now because of President Trump the worlds biggest oil exporter
2327 2018-05-09 20:04:32 Higher oil prices certainly do.
2328 2018-05-09 20:04:26 @Hamfosi44 
Dear friends, the reason why Mercedes went back on 2016 spec oil, was because they had small overheating issues + be under the allowed usage & prepared for the future changes. They chose conservative modes & treatment while Ferrari already chose the strategy
2329 2018-05-09 20:04:22 @MayorGregor Based on multiple sources Canada's GDP number 1 sector is housing (Reference Vancouver and Toronto housing bubbles), Oil and Gas came in either 2nd or 3rd depending on the source.  That’s hardly a small amount of the overall economy.

2334 2018-05-09 20:03:55 That’s ok. Saudi Arabia is planning to supply the oil that Iran’s regime won’t be able to do because of sanctions resulting from their own stinky behavior.

2339 2018-05-09 20:03:13 At a press conference yesterday Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said:

“The possible oil price increase and the trickle down effects for the US economy is at best a secondary concern.”

Not a concern...from the mouth of a millionaire.
2340 2018-05-09 20:03:07 He and his boss Vlad want to raise oil. Prices.
2341 2018-05-09 20:03:03 Price of oil now back to over $71. Haven’t seen this price since 2014. How much has changed for you since then?
2342 2018-05-09 20:03:03 oh it was just stuff like a big drum full of water and another drum of oil and a bunch of canned food. Nothing really exciting.

2344 2018-05-09 20:02:51 I love just putting it on salads with oil, salt and pepper  sometimes I’ll eat a whole head of lettuce and then I get a stomach ache from the vinegar 
2345 2018-05-09 20:02:46 Oil extraction must stop. There is already an endless supply of waste from oil and gas that can go into a digester.
2346 2018-05-09 20:02:43 my tweet was poorly worded. I meant to say that it's so ubiquitous that reading labels becomes pointless when 1 in 10 products has palm oil, so even if you choose the one without, there's still 9 others that have it. some are impossible to avoid, was what i meant.
2347 2018-05-09 20:02:39 @CanadianTire I bought a Simoniz 3000psi gas pressure washer from you guys a few weeks ago. I tried to turn it on today to wash my car, and it won't start. I've tried Simoniz' troubleshooting from their website, but it still doesn't start. Full gas and oil.

I covet your prayers deeply Pastor Gabe...
2350 2018-05-09 20:02:14 Drawdown in any backwardated market is obvious. The question though is whether refineries with their current crude oil slate can actually stop this distillate inventory slide or do they need to change the slate and run a heavier blend? Much of the demand for distillate is exports
2351 2018-05-09 20:02:06 KSA had Iran in a world-wide oil glut choke-hold. Obama screwed them hard by ending sanctions, opening Iran oil to global markets, & giving them tons of cash for terror. 3 more ballistic missiles fired at KSA today. Thx Barry!
2352 2018-05-09 20:02:03 And great for Russian oil companies (and Russian economy), as Iranian oil will become less marketable and world supply tightens.
2353 2018-05-09 20:01:43 The oils taste icky, I agree. I also use a CBD in coconut oil as a rub directly on joints. I will research yours. There's weird laws here about importing CBD so probably illegal although pot is legal. Go fig..

2358 2018-05-09 20:01:22 Ive read the deal and it wasnt a good one for the US.. dems even admitted it in emails. Iran has financially funded a large  number of terror groups ISIS and Hezbollah are among them. Not to mention of course countries agree when it gets cheaper oil and America fits the bill...

Just because AB economy is bouncing back doesn’t mean this is a result of NDP. All economists predicted a turnaround due to oil price. NDP has hired a lot of govt workers to offset private losses. Socialism doesn’t work.

2412 2018-05-09 19:58:13 It’s not Mother’s Day but one year my grandmother bought everyone racing car oil. You had to driver your car 500 miles straight before putting the oil in the car. I also at the time was too young to drive.
2413 2018-05-09 19:58:09 No, when you buy stock you're buying a share of a package of *productive* stuff, which (theoretically) produces profit. You *could* eventually make your money back from dividends or buybacks. If you buy oil, the oil doesn't *make* anything while you hold it.

2415 2018-05-09 19:57:48 A load of #orangeturd This bastard @realDonaldTrump has no shame. American tax payers are the losers here. Saudi, Israel, Mossad, and Big Oil are the winners.
2416 2018-05-09 19:57:44 $SPRN: 0.037's up, looking good again, someone tried to pull down & loaded cheap all day, IMO.  Oil & Gas stocks are HOT now!
2417 2018-05-09 19:57:43 I hate doing adult things like getting an oil change. I wish my parents could everything for me forever
2418 2018-05-09 19:57:34 Had you simply been long any of the oil leaders you'have huge gains. Instead of trying to outsmart the oil market. You, me not anyone else can outsmart the MARKET
2419 2018-05-09 19:57:33 I say someday we’ll find out that the swings DT causes in stock and oil prices due to his crazy policy announcements on tariffs, Middle East issues, etc. are being traded on by him and his cronies to make themselves huge profits.
2420 2018-05-09 19:57:33 My city is still "blocked" because MUH OIL so I can't go to college, and my depression doesn't let me do anything else. I'm effing dying.
2421 2018-05-09 19:57:27 AAZ was the gold miner I visited. The PSA  agreed with government was modelled on the oil industry but gold doesn’t flow like oil at low marginal cost. Shareholders fund the capex & take all the risks but upside is heavily constrained
2422 2018-05-09 19:57:21 @canadianGreens. Not selling your ethically produced nat resource for the best $ while importing oil from countries w/ 0 enviro & safety regs & poor human rights records is a disservice to our Nation.  All that revenue goes to fill social program coffers. Stop hurting CANADIANS.
2423 2018-05-09 19:57:13 When oil prices spike up, will Russia benefit?
2424 2018-05-09 19:57:10 They're so fucking stupid. There's no cleaning this shit up, we're already fucked by oil alone.
2425 2018-05-09 19:57:06 You this oil belong to me so make sure to check eastrn Europe this fucker Salman hiding two trillion dollars so I gave you a green light go a head and put 38% in capital one of the 2 trillion dollars..wIll see soon

2429 2018-05-09 19:56:39 Fixing an oil leak in any kind of vehicle is a headache no one should ever have to go through
2430 2018-05-09 19:56:37 #Brent_Crude pushing upward $77 three and half year high. Ego driven politics and the whole world suffers.. #crude #Brent #oil
2431 2018-05-09 19:56:34 Improved sentiment was indicated by gains in equities (S&P500 +1.0%), oil (+3.1%), and US bond yields. Confirmation the US will reinstate sanctions on Iran was one driver.
2432 2018-05-09 19:56:26 コミュ症だろうが気にしないけど、周りに気を使わせるだけで自分勝手に行動したり、自分から向かって行かない人は苦手、昔からそういう人よく押し付けられてたから

ただ、上手く話せなくても笑顔を見せたり、行動で自分から頑張ろうとしてるそういう人は素敵だと思う
2433 2018-05-09 19:56:21 Boeing is principally located where, exactly?  Toodle-ooo, ye despot Californians.  The oil & gas industry in the Gulf of Mexico is excited as all-get-out.
2434 2018-05-09 19:56:21 Oh My G-D. PLEASE beg them for me to bring back CALANDRE Paefum, Talc Powder, Body Lotion, Bath Oil and all their other CALANDRE scented products. I can’t live without!
2435 2018-05-09 19:56:16 So pleased to read that the EU is taking palm oil seriously but they need to act fast before all the forests are gone along with orangutans and other endangered animals.
2436 2018-05-09 19:56:15 How in the hell did your 401k go up?The stock price at my oil company is down under Trump. I got an $86.47 raise every two weeks that’s cancelled out by higher gas prices. Two of the NK hostages were taken hostage under Trump. I paid even more in taxes. Wtf are you talking about?
2437 2018-05-09 19:56:11 Sustainable living but some of your brands use palm oil
2438 2018-05-09 19:56:10  you slay me dude!
2439 2018-05-09 19:56:07 I was cooking some shrimp in the skillet sans shirt and some oil popped me in the nipple. I can’t remember the last time I cried like this
2440 2018-05-09 19:56:03 When it comes to leasing a car the maintenance oil changes tire changes everything too lit.. don’t gotta pay for shit lol
2441 2018-05-09 19:55:57 Why spend that much on equipments and not the man who carries them??instead of giving them a high end tech give them a better future,or enough with wars,or the oil companies will be angry?greed have no soul I guess..
2442 2018-05-09 19:55:54 @juliemason My take: Re Iran: Any major deal has prominent winners and losers.  A recurring theme, however, is with cost of oil up Russian economy benefits.  Or, put another way, Russia benefits, *again*!  Your thoughts?
2443 2018-05-09 19:55:52 Withdrawing from the Iran deal is making oil prices skyrocket, which hugely benefits?

You guessed it!

Russia and the Koch Brothers!

This was the obvious outcome.

@realDonaldTrump knows exactly who his daddies are and he gives them all the love they can handle!
2444 2018-05-09 19:55:45 If your oil is synthetic it should be fine. They wanted me to come in at 3k but I pushed it to 10k, checking my oil stick regularly and it was fine
2445 2018-05-09 19:55:40 How about helping the people in Venezuela helping produce some more oil.. lift the sanctions
2446 2018-05-09 19:55:39 Hi I'm still unhappy that you do not list palm oil amongst the ingredients of your peanut butter. Whether it is sustainable or not. #disappointing #opaque #oppositeoftransparent
2447 2018-05-09 19:55:33 Been doing some reading & chatting about #PalmOil ahead of watching tomorrow. Being a #ConsciousConsumer can help but challenges everywhere! First is China proposing to increase palm oil import quota-less consumer pressure for #sustainable products there than US or EU market 1/2
2448 2018-05-09 19:55:31 As soon as the sun come out i got shorts and mad oil on, i need to get as dark as possible like asap
2449 2018-05-09 19:55:30 No. That highlights genetic component. I would arrange a talk with Prof Long. While veg oil eat al may encourage cell mutation it is a far deeper story. I try never to burn here, not even a little. My Vit D at 90, no burn or supplement. I go our unprotected only UV 3 or less.
2450 2018-05-09 19:55:20 Agree, but keep in mind your view is colored by 45 yrs of world's biggest oil importer running massive twin deficits which in turn requires deep & liquid asset mkts.  China runs a surplus = Deep mkts not needed, b/c CNH can be exchanged for Chinese goods, net amts will be small.
2451 2018-05-09 19:55:20 So once they leave office, all's forgiven?

2452 2018-05-09 19:55:20 I will explain the current one..but with each trade it would be different..I got a signal for a short in M8 at 71.30..got it..fell below 71...did not break..as it reentered 71 again my hedge took a long in N8....if 71 breaks the hedge is sold off..and the short continues..
2453 2018-05-09 19:55:14 Baru start baca manifesto PH. Mcm takde apa spesifik. But oh well no 1, hapuskan GST. Idk if oil at 77usd now they can recoup 25bilion. They shud be able to, but maybe tukar nama kot. Or no gst for items below rm20. Lol
2454 2018-05-09 19:55:13 Saudi Arabia and US in same boat, even with huge oil reserves if obese turns into diabetics requiring decades of expensive care and unable to work they will be financially insolvent.

2456 2018-05-09 19:55:08 I've said all along that trump is looking for a reason to attack Iran ( being they hadn't broken the Nuclear agreement) trump just ended the agreement knowing Israel & Iran would be at it in no time & trump would run to his buddy "Bibi" Netanyahu to help
This is about OIL & Money
2457 2018-05-09 19:55:07 If you coat some polar bears in crude oil and leave them on @lisamurkowski door she might be willing to listen.
2458 2018-05-09 19:55:00 Coconut, jojoba, shea, jamaican black castor oil. Those will be your best friends.
2459 2018-05-09 19:54:53 You need oil lol
2460 2018-05-09 19:54:43 Oil is at it's highest price in 3 1/2 years. Thanks Trump
2461 2018-05-09 19:54:39 That’s true, but for over a decade Bolton has advocated the extensive bombing of Iran. It could be like when Bush 43 used a lie about WMD so he could invade Iraq & try to take over their oil fields.
2462 2018-05-09 19:54:36 Today while filling my car tank some oil spilled and that reminded me of that tragic incidence gosh what happened to those families was painful beyond words
2463 2018-05-09 19:54:14 So ready to come home for a week spend Mother’s Day with Momma than it’s back to oil field life Wyoming be our next location 
2464 2018-05-09 19:54:02 How about freeing up some oil in Venezuela and Libya
2465 2018-05-09 19:54:01 I feel so accomplished. Oil change  gas spark plugs changed packing  photo shoot booked  phone fixed  gym 
2466 2018-05-09 19:53:59 Now that is gorgeous. Thanks. Now I can see you wouldn't have drizzled olive oil on the veg. Stoopid question.
2467 2018-05-09 19:53:54 T mixed in anti war stuff with the other crazy shit both him and Pence said throughout the campaign. So even though T said we should take their oil and Pence talked about corralling China with bases the stuff in the stump speech about Iraq being wasteful and mistake resonated imo
2468 2018-05-09 19:53:36 Bought some Neem oil today.... boy that mess is STRONG! Just from smelling it I think my hair grew 
@Nap85 put me on! 
2469 2018-05-09 19:53:27 No one has mentioned Putin is elated that 45 has driven the price of oil way up. He was upset when Obama got the Iranian deal because it caused a rollback in oil prices.
2470 2018-05-09 19:53:15 Must be oil there for Genie company.
2471 2018-05-09 19:53:15 I left all the fibromyalgia ones because it was just daily new posts of people asking who had tried CBD oil every god damn day
2472 2018-05-09 19:53:14 Put out some used teabags soaked in Peppermint oil.
2473 2018-05-09 19:53:13 Only 10 months till Democrats take over the house and Senate and start to get blamed for everything from the deficit to oil prices to the weak job market.
2474 2018-05-09 19:52:58 It’s bomb! It worked for me. I use the oil as a moisturizer too esp before make up
2475 2018-05-09 19:52:51 Watching @RT_com and it's clear:
- America is pushing away our allies and is becoming more irrelevant in global affairs.
- Oil prices will rise and the global economy will be damaged.
- Trump's biggest donors are staunch conservative Zionists.
- So many lies about the deal.
2476 2018-05-09 19:52:50 Cute, how she thinks her opinion is sought out.
2477 2018-05-09 19:52:37 How do you lose someone’s whole ass car keys after doing an oil change:)
2478 2018-05-09 19:52:26 lunch today was fish tacos.

because it turns out "sautee some fish in oil and harissa, then throw it on a tortilla" is both easy and nomnomnom
2479 2018-05-09 19:52:20 @granosefood and youve got palm oil in the mix! please amend the recipe.

2481 2018-05-09 19:52:19 Fears? Look at oil, gasoline, lumber, housing in general. Its too damn real.
2482 2018-05-09 19:52:18 Did you get permission from your puppet master Pooty before you pulled out of Iran deal? Probably Pooty's idea anyway (good for Russian oil) and UR just doing his work for him.

2486 2018-05-09 19:51:49 I seriously HATE getting my oil changed. So many men make me feel like such an idiot and I do not appreciate it.

2488 2018-05-09 19:51:43 It moved enough to tighten the chain after a number of taps forwards on the BB so it's moving a bit. I'll get some oil in there first, see if that helps. It's creaking a fair bit at the moment.

Crude oil prices climbed more than 3%, extending three-and-a-half year highs, after a larger than expected drawdown in U.S crude stockpiles added to gains from the U.S. decision to exit the nuclear deal with Iran.

2498 2018-05-09 19:50:21 Most of it has been baked into oil prices at this point. The market was out in front of this story, as usual.

The second wind-down period ends on Nov. 4, 2018, and it will bring sanctions on industries such as shipping, oil, petrochemicals, and the energy sector. The US will again pursue efforts to reduce Iran's sale of crude oil.
2501 2018-05-09 19:50:10 Don’t Hold Your BreathWith This Crap Going Down With Iran, Big Oil Is Just Looking For A Reason To Raise Prices.We Will See
2502 2018-05-09 19:50:08 Yes I will fuck off and yes I do know the definition of snake oil: selling something as helpful which does not work, taking advantage of people.
2503 2018-05-09 19:50:01 Oil
2504 2018-05-09 19:49:27 So much  all those tweets that are liked. Forgetting there is a little Iran issue and we should invest in oil, whether shorting or longing ( up to you)
2505 2018-05-09 19:49:15 @BBCWatchdog VW are ignoring another serious defect with their T5 CFCA engines and disintegrating EGR Valves - causing excessive engine wear and oil useage (high carbon emissions) and catastrophic engine failure @VWGroup @vwpress_en stop ignoring this - shocking customer service.

2507 2018-05-09 19:49:12 The only way our high tax, high wage, low productivity economy can compete against the USA is via a weak currency, one that would be much weaker were it not for the price of oil. Yes, oil, you know, that commodity so despised by the LPC and NDP.
2508 2018-05-09 19:49:02 He’s not. He’s probably better 2 way, but krugs far stronger ability to create offence supersedes the aforementioned difference. At the very least it’s close for different reasons. But even if I like krug more, it’s agreed the contract details make it a bad move for the oil
2509 2018-05-09 19:49:01 They’re taking forever for this oil change and I’m hungry asf
2510 2018-05-09 19:48:50 Congrats! You get a tin of John West. Your choice of spring water, brine, or sunflower oil.

2513 2018-05-09 19:48:45 Exactly. Coking coal and gasification is so 19th century
2514 2018-05-09 19:48:42 good, let them blow each other up and we'll be done with all of them. if they didn't have oil no one would give a shit about them.
2515 2018-05-09 19:48:23 I love @NYR_Official frankincense range, use @Naissanceuk oils and love @FushiWellbeing rosehip oil as an all round moisturiser. Also check out @ORGANiiUK #OrganicHour
2516 2018-05-09 19:48:18 Thanks for the info. I wouldn't be surprised if they manage to increase the power just with different engine maps given this is basically a brand new architecture. 
I'm hoping Petronas will deliver an oil upgrade soon as well.
2517 2018-05-09 19:48:12 We're watching the markets live after President Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal sent oil prices surging. US crude futures jumped 3% on Wednesday to trade at $71 per barrel, their highest level since late 2014.

2521 2018-05-09 19:47:36 Indeed it does, bit of oil on there, 5-8 mins indirect heat, then 1 minute direct heat before serving.

2523 2018-05-09 19:47:28 Doing my best over here. Oil sure has taken some patience. Sentiment controls, have to wait for it to come your way.
2524 2018-05-09 19:47:15 The mkt has already priced in termination of the #irandeal so you're not seeing big movement from that factor. But Iran's oil output will slacken and oil prices will continue to rise. That has major global economic import-and it's not positive either.
2525 2018-05-09 19:47:12 Sounds like a good time to jump onboard.

2536 2018-05-09 19:46:19 Tumblr still doesn't understand basic science as they think radioactive diamonds that produce 15 joules a day is a worthy power source to replace gas/oil.

For comparison, the average AA battery is around 13,000 joules.

2538 2018-05-09 19:46:06 The world leaders will negotiate w/Saudi Arabia, Iran & others to trade oil in a currency other than US dollars.

The US will be finished as a leader & a superpower.

The US will be left to wallow in mediocrity and obscurity with its allies, (try to fill in the blank).
2539 2018-05-09 19:45:58 Strategic “control” in that region has nothing to do with oil,terrorists & religion. It’s all about precious battery minerals prolific in Afghanistan and Pakistan that are closest to the largest Manufacturing economies of China & India. My co-workers father was a senior geologist
2540 2018-05-09 19:45:54 Mr Kill Bill wake up BARREL / LITRE/ crude oil = not only petrol & diesel it's much more than that wake up from ur consciousness don't fool around the Bush......

My son has violent outbursts and has had issues playing w the stove...no pans of hot oil. As with most things, there are folks who will abuse it.But most of us r just trying to feed our kids.

2544 2018-05-09 19:45:34 How does it cost $85 to get my oil changed I just gotta know
2545 2018-05-09 19:45:31 So, it wasn't really about Iran itself, or Iran's Nuclear potential or anything else ... it was about setting the stage for T-Rump's 'Big Oil Buddies' to make a killing since one can no longer get oil from Iran...!  So very swampy...!

2548 2018-05-09 19:45:23 Bravo @IcelandFoods for taking a moral stance on refusing to use palm oil products. This little snippet of film demonstrates heartbreakingly well man’s myriad ways of abusing the earth and it’s inhabitants. Time to make it stop.....

2550 2018-05-09 19:45:13 Why are there no essential oils extracted from meat? I'd really love to diffuse "prime rib" or "rack of lamb." There's tons of oil and fat in meats. Surely someone can figure this out.

2554 2018-05-09 19:45:02 Gas prices are already going up because we violated the Iran Deal. Good news for Russia! They depend on high oil prices! Boeing loses a huge contract with Iran, but Russia gets lots of oil money!  Thanks @POTUS!

2560 2018-05-09 19:44:19 Good news!!! Just what we wanted, right?
2561 2018-05-09 19:44:16 And as news reported here in Germany, because of the withdrawal, the prices for raw oil could raise, so Russia will be in favor to deliver at lower prices. Could be just another gift from Spanky for Putin.

2584 2018-05-09 19:41:24 One summer, when very very poor and young; I planted basil seeds and raised them into a veritable lawn of basil. Well, two window boxes. I bought olive oil, pine-nuts and parmesan at huge expense (it was the 80s). And made pesto.
2585 2018-05-09 19:41:21 Record oil prices are great for Donny's ultra-wealthy friends in the oil corporations but a disaster for consumers. So much winning. 
Also great for Russia. Putin's agenda is now our agenda.

2599 2018-05-09 19:39:50 He did it to drive up oil prices so Russia can make more money selling their oil when Iran can’t sell its oil due to sanctions. The Obama thing is just the cherry to Trump. He really just cares about money & Keeping Putin happy.
2600 2018-05-09 19:39:49 I don't think it will go that high...but it certainly is possible. 

And that would be fine with me and my electric car.   The high oil prices would at least have the benefit of aiding the transition to EVs.
2601 2018-05-09 19:39:40 Trump is not strong, he's Putin's bitch.  Do the math, if you are able.  What is the result of this action?  Higher oil prices...Russia benefits.
The sanctions go against the West, fool, like say, Boeing who just lost billions with the action. The others penalized? Our allies.
2602 2018-05-09 19:39:35 Rouhani to Macron today: "Iran's interests regarding important issues such as the oil sale, banking relations, investment and insurance must become clear and guaranteed."

2606 2018-05-09 19:39:19 They hold up their side of the deal, and we shout "OIL OIL OIL" and leave the deal to please Israel and Saudi Arabia and than sanction Iran ? You expect em to love us ?

2608 2018-05-09 19:39:09 The Left love Iran. Why?  Equal treatment of women?  Corbyn guest appearances on Iranian TV?  They want to destroy Israel?  They love to burn American flags?  Could it be they prove an Islamic regime can be successful with a little oil and intimidation?  All of the above.
2609 2018-05-09 19:38:59 Changed my oil today, also need to change my clothes because I apparently don’t know how to not spill oil all over myself.

2612 2018-05-09 19:38:29 Yet many of those majidi malls are owned by Turkey lol. Only different bewteen Baghdad and Erbil, is that Erbil is more shiny. Having tall buildings doesn't say much about how developed the actual economy is. What do Kurds export other than oil?

2615 2018-05-09 19:38:20 "The US is now producing 10.7 million barrels per day of oil!"-Trader Dan.

Regardless of this production increase, the numbers clearly show an inventory drawdown = strong global demand for oil and distillates. Iran sanctions fear is also keeping price up, but that's noise IMO.

2633 2018-05-09 19:36:43 Oh, and that's for the oil price hike Donny, sort of eliminated any bonus my paycheck saw from the dotard tax plan.
2634 2018-05-09 19:36:34 Oil prices soar after Trump dumps Iran nuclear deal; If the choice of nuclear war against us and Israel against higher oil prices, I chose higher oil prices! Maybe we can provide our own!
2635 2018-05-09 19:36:25 And if Trump invades Iran, I guess he'll keep the oil......
2636 2018-05-09 19:36:24 Hi Nick, thanks for the question. The oil pan is not under any type of internal pressure. Welding the perimeter of the patch prevents any leaks from the repair. Thank you.
2637 2018-05-09 19:36:22 Venezuela collapse can be the next trigger to take oil prices higher by a couple of dollars ... would be interesting to see if shale supply can counter the oil price rise

2645 2018-05-09 19:35:43 And there is the real reason for the reason. He's clearly done as much as he can for oil and mining. Not to mention high oil prices benefit Putin too.
2646 2018-05-09 19:35:35 Only Saudi and Russia produce more oil than the US. Last I checked, Nigeria isn’t even in the top 10. Even the oil wey we dey hold for head, no be we get am, lmao. Most of our biggest importers produce more oil than us. 
2647 2018-05-09 19:35:34 Israel, Saudi Arabia, and oil company interests are all aligned and paid tribute to Trump's lawyer Cohen. I am certain that the cost of Trump's chaos in trade, oil price, and health care are going to cost Americans a fortune that far surpasses any of the tax cuts.

2663 2018-05-09 19:34:17 So they oust the town administrator because he's too pro-growth and too pro- Oil and Gas and then approve a huge new development near future oil and gas activity - thereby guaranteeing endless strife in the future.  Meet the new boss - same as the old boss.
2664 2018-05-09 19:34:15 This is just my guess on how he plays it (and how I'd play it if I had a ton in my account).

2670 2018-05-09 19:33:12 When Federal Politicians declare that States in Nigeria can't survive without Federal Allocations, as if they are saying something new and important, I wonder why if they don't know that even the @AsoRock  lives on rent from Oil.

2686 2018-05-09 19:31:42 I took my car to get an oil change & tire rotation @ 2:30pm.... I asked the lady how much longer and she replied “oh you wanted it back today?”
2687 2018-05-09 19:31:39 Me: how long do you usually leave coconut oil in your hair?
Kelsie: about an hour and a half... Well whatever 4 episodes of the office is
2688 2018-05-09 19:31:35 I’m mad my brother woke me up from a deep sleep to ask if I had “baby oil”...even after the fact I tell him no, he proceeds to grab my witch hazel & ask if it’s baby oil ?!? nigga...NOOOOO!! IF YOU DINT GET OUT OF MY ROOM W THAT NONSENSE
2689 2018-05-09 19:31:34 What will you do to assist in keeping oil in the state?
2690 2018-05-09 19:31:34 Semua parti kalau menang kalah aku bagitahu latest by twelve. No more burning the midnight oil.
2691 2018-05-09 19:31:28 There goes your tax cut ... middle class....just think....You put sanctions on Iranian oil ...now you have  US...Saudi Arabia...Russia...all big seller's of oil with oil hitting 80-90 dollars a barrel...and Europe and China net importer's... should be interesting
2692 2018-05-09 19:31:24 I think it means he follows the direction of the current fractal cycle with the front contract (that being CL8M right now), while playing these short term plays with months further out. So if let's say the short term move he posted doesn't happen, he can leave it while riding up.

Be back  When ever I please.

Watch your RISK and Do NOT trade OIL unless U own a well.
2695 2018-05-09 19:31:05 Paul, can you define more oil?
2696 2018-05-09 19:31:01 Yes - but North Sea oil has nearly run out . Now .... who said that and when?
2697 2018-05-09 19:31:00 It is safe and it is happening right now. Do you propose stopping much of north sea oil production recovered through fracking?
2698 2018-05-09 19:30:33 Okay! promote Coconut oil people will listen or olive oil. I use coconut oil it smells good taste good makes ur hair shine and skin. Sounds like I lather in it but I don't.

2701 2018-05-09 19:30:19 Unfortunately with these oligarchs, “peak oil” will only be accepted as a premise when there is enough crude left to fill a water bottle
2702 2018-05-09 19:30:09 Lmao WOW I need an oil change
2703 2018-05-09 19:30:04 Nora ran out of her baby oil gel i put in her hair after her baths & my mom put foxy curly spray in her hair last night & today noras hair looks like don kings

2711 2018-05-09 19:29:08 He never said tomorrow. However he did say he wished he could phase them out sooner while in France. Bad investment how so. Oil demand continues to climb for the next 3-4 decades by estimates. Sounds like a good investment to me
2712 2018-05-09 19:29:08 Hi Jimboman, by hedging do you mean your bettering the cost average for your overall short? (This combined with the previously bought contracts)? Thanks!
2713 2018-05-09 19:29:01 A friend of mine had one. It leaked oil everywhere, was expensive to run in general, and the only good thing it's for is Back to the Future references. Side note: you can get an electric-powered one nowadays.
2714 2018-05-09 19:28:45 For Mother’s Day let’s stand up to trump so no mother has to lose a child in a war started by trump to divert our attention away from Muller investigation. He is already funding his partners Russia/ Saudis to start the war through higher oil prices.
2715 2018-05-09 19:28:43 isn't it intentional? I mean, the Chinese deliberately chose to release their corn stocks in 2016 or 2017? I think CHina keeps "strategic stocks" only of oil and rare earths now.
2716 2018-05-09 19:28:41 And make it easier for us to tell if something has palm oil in it by putting it on the label, currently companies aren’t required to by law in Australia, we’re working on it but the decision keeps getting postponed for some reason
2717 2018-05-09 19:28:32 Well if they do go up, we'll see shale oil companies be more profitable here in the U.S. They've been struggling for quite a while now.

2721 2018-05-09 19:28:20 great idea...as a Californian, I support it 100%...save our beautiful state from the oil profiteers!
2722 2018-05-09 19:28:14 Remember just 1 day ago when they blatantly made up reasons for crude oil being down. Literally making it up and lying to you as they go along. These type of people add zero value
2723 2018-05-09 19:28:04 And as a father it was a very pleasant hospital free experience. I fully support this. Not to mention how awesome midwives are. Nurses too but you know what I mean.
2724 2018-05-09 19:28:03 Russia wanted cheaper oil from Iran?
2725 2018-05-09 19:28:01 3 biggest Technical developments given to clients this am:  1) Crude oil completely recovering minor weakness and back to new highs -72.50 Tgt likely  2) Bond yield breakout..Right to avoid /Sell TY with TNX tgts 3.05%.  3) S&P back above 2680 early, should be en route to 2715-22
2726 2018-05-09 19:27:59 True. However the previous ruler, Shah Reza Pahlavi, was a dictator who imprisoned thousands of political opponents.  

The previous ruler, Mohammad Mosaddegh, was a legitimately elected secular and reform leader overthrown by the CIA when he nationalized oil.

2732 2018-05-09 19:27:31 Bro never smoke oil and try to do commentary
2733 2018-05-09 19:27:28 I dreamed a dream of McDonald’s fries that came w additional options. Namely, truffle oil and/or garlic seasonings.
Was it a dream? Perhaps. 
A prophecy? We can only hope
2734 2018-05-09 19:27:20 Wipes are useful-people that flush them ARE NOT-probably the same ones that put OIL DOWN THE DRAIN.
2735 2018-05-09 19:27:05 EV sales growth has been remarkable during the last 3 years of low oil prices. Now let's see what happens with oil at +$70/barrel and lots of new models.
2736 2018-05-09 19:26:54 Get them lower, he single handedly shut down the Balkan turning communities in North Dakota into ghost towns along with putting restrictions on fracking...all of which helped opec solidify its stranglehold on oil prices.
2737 2018-05-09 19:26:53 Iran deal was bad idea from the very beginning, sanctions do not work either, China will buy Iranian oil.

2746 2018-05-09 19:25:55 The most annoying thing about working in the oil industry is the phoquing oil. Get bathe down today all inside my ears is oil. Phoque !
2747 2018-05-09 19:25:54 Sasol is a petrochemical company not an oil company. A lot of of income is derived from chemicals, not oil

2750 2018-05-09 19:25:45 The oil price has well and truly recovered. Never mind the argument about that is nonsense to begin with. Scotland never has completely relied on oil.

2752 2018-05-09 19:25:27 No that was you saudis. A kingdom built by the British. Installed with a enemy of Islam royals. Protected by the USA. Giving their oil and soul away.

2759 2018-05-09 19:25:05 How about we make it oil and you give me a massage..
2760 2018-05-09 19:24:53 It was the CIA & British Intelligence in the 50s that led a covert coup to overthrow the democratically elected leader & install the Shah over oil interests. Which created the tension between countries & then creation of the Islamic Republic to counter “the great Satan”.
2761 2018-05-09 19:24:53 Stopppp no way! Just coffee grounds & coconut oil? 
2762 2018-05-09 19:24:53 I dropped my car off for a oil change at 8:30 this morning .... it’s almost 3:30 and she still not done
2763 2018-05-09 19:24:51 CHARLES. Can’t take much more of this. You’re perception of what is going on today reflects what a lot of down in their luck racial leaning people feel.

2772 2018-05-09 19:23:59 @juleshyman Great Analysis on markets but oil in case if it moves very high around 100 dollar than will do damage like 2007 crisis as corporates would start contracting
2773 2018-05-09 19:23:54 This is a wrong move. Solar panels adds pollution during manufacturing. Very bad decision. Oil and gas are much better.

2775 2018-05-09 19:23:52 This move will make it harder for #Iran to sell its oil to other countries.Oil prices which are already at a four year high, will rise further if the supply from Iran gets reduce. #WW3 #IranNuclearDeal

#TheZoo
2784 2018-05-09 19:23:18 @McVities very disappointed to read the ingredients in chocolate biscuits has palm oil. You must know what harm that oil is doing to the forests and orangutans. Won’t be buying them again. Why don’t you stop using it?
2785 2018-05-09 19:23:14 so maybe trump and his saudi buddies made deals behind doors and trump purposely pulled out of the iran deal so arabian oil goes up?
2786 2018-05-09 19:23:13 Looks like I might have a stocker checking out my girls  Still not showing, but my guess is, it's gonna be coconut oil  !
2787 2018-05-09 19:23:05 And with rising oil prices due to this decision, Russia would get a good return on their "investment"
2788 2018-05-09 19:23:04 After 12th May please. Our "autonomous" oil companies are waiting for a green signal from the Govt to increase the prices....
2789 2018-05-09 19:23:03 Who said that market has nothing to do with crude oil prices!! Just recall your memories n see since 2016 when crude hit $27 till now in 2018 when crude $70!! & what market has done you all know!!
2790 2018-05-09 19:22:58 for prevention, Ariul makes a tea tree oil sheet mask that costs a pittance (like $2.50 a pop) but makes my skin feel much calmer and less clogged up, it is a very nice gentle cleanser

2792 2018-05-09 19:22:44 @BBCWatchdog - Please, Please, please investigate the issues with the Volkswagen CFCA engines in their Transporter range of vehicles.  Many owners are having issues with the engines using huge amounts of oil for which the only fix is a new engine.
2793 2018-05-09 19:22:30 She wasn’t trying pay for the oil change 
2794 2018-05-09 19:22:30 the day and night serum, the marula oil, protini, babyfacial and the c-tango eye cream so basically everything HAHAHAH
2795 2018-05-09 19:22:25 Saudi Arabia wants 2 trillion for #Aramco IPO
So they are asking for 2.5 trillion so that by negotiating it comes down to 2.
Which means they had to take oil to $80-$90 from $48.
2796 2018-05-09 19:22:24 Dear Senator , plz make your facts correct, currently oil being traded at $70 and expected to increase! Pakistan is selling cheapest oil to its consumer market compared to its neighbors. Don’t expect distorted facts and lies from you!

With oil prices hitting $71 today, I wonder how feasable and realistic does Ana Matosantos’ centrally-planned-and-price-controlled” energy generation proposal look now? Capping kw at 21cents looks great on paper. Who’ll fund the subsidy?
2800 2018-05-09 19:22:07 Sooo if you put coconut oil on your booty it makes it taste like an almond joy?
2801 2018-05-09 19:22:05 It’s all about oil, follow the money. Do you think the USA would be anywhere in the Middle East if their main export was broccoli???
2802 2018-05-09 19:21:59 Money is the game, who pays the most is not an enemy. They just mad, we refused paying for their oil.
2803 2018-05-09 19:21:45 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.
2804 2018-05-09 19:21:40 That’s the cheapest oil some cars require synthetic.

2811 2018-05-09 19:20:16 Got my oil changed and saw @jalenramsey at the dealership lol
2812 2018-05-09 19:20:09 Um, no I don’t think so. I wasn’t willing to lie though and pretend that the oil wasn’t just going to move some other way that is less safe (or that I don’t care about pipefitting jobs)
2813 2018-05-09 19:20:03 "Oil prices soar after Trump dumps Iran nuclear deal"

Yep.  #IBlameTrump
2814 2018-05-09 19:20:02 While I agree both parties play this game... people hammered obama for rising oil prices and all he did was fight to get them lower, trump literally does something to hike them and the right is saying “eh... it happens” 
2815 2018-05-09 19:20:00 A packet of biscuits is not worth the destructive of those forests for palm oil. I am now checking labels !

2817 2018-05-09 19:19:47 I'm getting my oil changed at the dealership and I'm eavesdropping on this lady's conversation. She's talking about how God sent her to get a new car. Also she said that some elderly guy who is dying "knows god and stuff so he's okay to go"
2818 2018-05-09 19:19:29 America needs to produce it's own oil! Stop pay Arabs to kill us!!!!!
2819 2018-05-09 19:19:22 It takes time to develop an industry. Alaskans pay zero state income tax and zero state sales tax - thanks to oil. But that didn't happen overnight.
2820 2018-05-09 19:19:19 Look at the actions the US is always taking against the last independent oil producer in the world (Iran). You're gonna need you're thinking cap for this one.
2821 2018-05-09 19:19:17 As many oil and natural gas resources as we have here, why should gas prices go up? I have family & friends who lost their oilfield jobs during the Obama years because Obama administration wouldn’t approve drilling on federal land. Let’s put our own oilfield workers back to work.
2822 2018-05-09 19:19:12 I thought @realDonaldTrump came in power to ease life of an ordinary American. The high gas price give direct access to these oil giants to the pocket of every person in the world
2823 2018-05-09 19:19:06 You'd kinda figure that most people are a bit to busy you be "kayactivists" (cute name BTW) But apparently not this bunch. Wonder who is paying their bills.. Canadian taxpayers or US anti oil groups?
2824 2018-05-09 19:19:03 The high oil price conspiracy game is playing nicely for the greedy scumbags...leeching bastards. Rot in hell!!!

2827 2018-05-09 19:18:54 @FoxNews We pull out of the Iran deal, it is said that it "may" interrupt or slow oil from Iran. Gas jumps .20 cents the next day, this is true Highway Robbery.
2828 2018-05-09 19:18:45 Trump is doing everything to ensure a resurgence of Oil prices....the covfefe is just an evil genius!!!.....

2831 2018-05-09 19:18:32 This physio who's a white lady told me to take my shirt off and pulled out massage oil and suddenly interracial porn story lines never seemed more sensible.
2832 2018-05-09 19:18:22 I used to buy this prior to being able to find jarred anchovies....perfect for tapenade and this tasty green sauce made with parsley, capers, lemon, Dijon mustard, scallions and olive oil.....probably has a formal name- Tasty Green Sauce?- but I sure can’t recall it.
2833 2018-05-09 19:18:13 Yes. Conservatives cite jobs & gov't revenue in supporting oil, so I'd say arguments highlighting all the jobs and revenue that banning oil tankers enables, and which allowing tankers would threaten, is the lowest hanging fruit.
2834 2018-05-09 19:18:10 depends on how you play it... the short is not done yet for the elephant from 71.30..but note..I hedge with back contracts  ..so if a up arrow appears and I am not out the hedge takes over.. with the elephant no trade ever goes to waste..:)
2835 2018-05-09 19:17:59 Gas bout to be higher than when the last Bush was in office. 

Unless The US finally gonna tap into our own oil reserves smh
2836 2018-05-09 19:17:45 Oil is the least of ours worries. Not to mention the sooner we get away from our reliance on oil the better.
2837 2018-05-09 19:17:43 Unlikely. I doubt they have the capacity. Iran only does about 4% of global oil production. Besides, it’s the uncertainty of what will happen now that the deal is effectively dead that will raise and keep the prices high (maybe)
2838 2018-05-09 19:17:39 45 minutes until I can go home, stuff my face, take way too long of a Epsom salt and lavender oil bath, and be a potato sitting in my dark house only lit by candles for the rest of the day. I need it so badly. I’m a hot mess today.

2848 2018-05-09 19:16:44 It's not to physically control the oil, it's to control what people need to buy oil and that's US dollars. That's why the US went after Iraq and that's why they are going after Iran and that's why they went after Libya
2849 2018-05-09 19:16:29 Get this oil changed then fill up the tank then I’m good
2850 2018-05-09 19:16:28 I never imagined that Americans will be disgustingly racist. Your hate for Obama is greater than your love for America. To quote Mr. Trump, "VERY VERRRYYYY VVVVVERRRRRYYYYYYYY SSSSSSSADDDDDD!!!!!" Please stew in your racist oil and enjoy.

2854 2018-05-09 19:16:11 USA was the neutralizer. Saudi’s and the Iranians hate each other. What could possibly be the reason? And then you put Russia in the mix. What could it be? They’re all fighting for the damn oil. And USA just picked a side via Trump.
2855 2018-05-09 19:16:07 Everybody is disgusted at the boneheaded move Trump made. Meanwhile, Russia gets its jet sales back, oil prices increased, and weapon sales increased
2856 2018-05-09 19:15:52 You made her sound like she needed an oil change, alignment & rotation. A clinical explanation might make more sense.

2868 2018-05-09 19:14:13 Well Stephen talk to Barry because I’m quoting him and for once I agreed with him, he conveniently left the other part of your statement out because I reckon it didn’t make him look good. This is a game both parted play quite often regarding oil.
2869 2018-05-09 19:14:12 Is it customary to put the CBP before or after my CSOT (Certified Snake Oil Technician) initials after my name?
2870 2018-05-09 19:14:09 Rise of crude oil should not have any affect what consumers pay at the pump, it is lame excuse by big refineries!
2871 2018-05-09 19:13:59 Do I actually know if cuticle oil works? No.
Am I still going to use it religiously? Yes.
2872 2018-05-09 19:13:55 When I see my ND tax bill go down, I will agree with you. Until then, higher oil prices do not directly benefit me .
2873 2018-05-09 19:13:55 El proceso de extracción, en la industria de oil & gas se llama producción

2875 2018-05-09 19:13:32 Thank you for your message. How can we help? It seems she dreadful that all of this is happening. I suppose Consumers can boycott as much palm oil as possible and I suppose we can also see if our governments can appeal to Borneo ( Malaysia,Indonesia and Brunei) to stop

2878 2018-05-09 19:13:12 Only 40% is Home extracted, and Middle East hugely affects the cost of the other 60 percent. So clear US interest in Middle East oil! PS going straight to insults instead of civilised debate offends me, as it should you

2884 2018-05-09 19:12:40 second, I am not sure there is any "real" news - always packaged aggrandized storytelling such that questions of reality are only do we think this something worth talking about - we have so few credible arbiters of this question that media freely drums snake oil sales for profit
2885 2018-05-09 19:12:32 I’m smart enough to know that I do not know. China’s big, still Red, and developing quickly. Russia’s best days are behind them, they yearn for the future Putin promised when oil prices were high, they hold a grudge, and they’re entangled in the Middle East.
2886 2018-05-09 19:12:32 Vast amount of 'subsidies' to oil & gas are just expenses that offset income before the company is taxed on profits. Problem with media is that they've got no income for expenses to offset; so they cry foul!  It would seem they are mad because their product is not market-viable.
2887 2018-05-09 19:12:24 Olive oil is not a chip flavor it’s a cooking aid
2888 2018-05-09 19:12:14 They better hide that Oil real quick
2889 2018-05-09 19:12:07 Tell that to 45 he’s the one complaining about us not taking the oil. You can find his 100’s of statements going way way back. As a Vet in during the 1st Persian Gulf we always knew those conflicts/wars were about oil. It’s not new knowledge.
2890 2018-05-09 19:11:59 Yeah it constantly needs oil

2893 2018-05-09 19:11:44 All valid points.. but reneging on the deal just allows them to continue their nuclear program unmonitored whilst still being able to trade with other nations.. US isn't a large trading partner + price of Oil goes up stateside. Useless pulling out unless a new deal is made
2894 2018-05-09 19:11:42 Mayo is just emulsified oil, eggs, and acid. It’s like sour cream, it adds a certain flavor that balances out sweetness and the oil is pretty much just like how ppl put butter on pancakes

2898 2018-05-09 19:11:22 It took 25 mins . Stir fry quorn mince with veg & fresh chopped tomatoes ( tinned makes it soggy ) lots of black pepper , fresh lemon  drop of olive oil, stir in lots of ketchup , pinch of sea salt . I forgot the egg glaze . Added balsamic at very end . Bake 15 mins . Brilliant!

2901 2018-05-09 19:11:14 I like most of it 
2902 2018-05-09 19:11:07 Others think for him. Backing out of Iran deal makes money for Russian oil. We, however, will be screwed at the pump. War in Iran will be regime change which will help Israel. We will lose many soldiers. The Con got conned.
2903 2018-05-09 19:11:06 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2904 2018-05-09 19:11:01 I guess getting oil Iran wouldn't be a problem, but for projects that require large investments, would major Chinese industry leaders risk this after what happened to ZTE?
2905 2018-05-09 19:10:55 I cannot stress how important sunscreen is. I literally don’t care if you wanna “tan” or not. I tan so easily using sunscreen and tanning oil. SAVE YOUR SKIN. It’s so important. Who wants to be 40 with wrinkles, sun spots, or even skin cancer?

2908 2018-05-09 19:10:32 Right now, billions of dollars of our oil is being stolen from us.

I never heard Idle No More clamor for regaining possession of that oil.

Nope. It's so much more important to just settle for begging for "clean water".

2918 2018-05-09 19:09:58 1. Even at $70/barrel, gas is still relatively cheap. But you could get a Prius or drive less if you're worried about it. 
   
2. Higher oil prices mean that the oil companies in ND pay more tax so that you can pay less tax.

2924 2018-05-09 19:09:09 If Canada is to meet its climate accord commitments why is oul consumption in the lower mainland increasing, not decreasing? If you made the noble effort to decrease your carbon use-great. Your neighbours are not. Oil already ahipping by rail. Don’t fool yourself
2925 2018-05-09 19:09:05 The Rouheni Regime isn't playing Trump and his war lords game. Iran is sticking to the deal with Europe. They'll continue selling oil and trade with our allies, not to USA. Iran is betting Trump is gone in the not too distant future. Trump just isolated us not Iran.

2942 2018-05-09 19:07:38 Mini Europe will only acknowledge that there’s “talk on internet chat rooms” about the issue. Keep your oil topped up (mini guidance is one litre of oil used every 700 miles) as that should help prevent the issue. I have the email address for the CEO of mini Europe if you need it

2949 2018-05-09 19:06:49 That isn't going to offset the sanctions /how they will affect crude oil supply because there are other factors (Venezuela).   The price of gas by the end of the summer will completely dilute your tax cut.

IRAQ OIL MINISTER LUAIBI SAYS OPEC TO DISCUSS POSSIBLE SHORTFALL IN OUTPUT ON THE BACK OF TRUMP DECISION TO WITHDRAW FROM IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL

RIP OPEC production cuts
2951 2018-05-09 19:06:27 Energy policy was a BIG part of U.S. policy implemented by the State Department. For oil-exporting countries, manipulating supply and demand is the key to preventing oil cartels from creating supply shortages. The drop in long term oil prices DECIMATED the Russian economy.
2952 2018-05-09 19:06:27 Totally possible. My friend Action Randy once burned down his entire house by making an olive oil Molotov cocktail and screaming “OLIVE BOIL!!” as he chucked it through the window. Haha good times!
2953 2018-05-09 19:06:24 The key to being a real reserve (or reserve-ish) currency is having deep liquid asset markets. China's inclusion into the bond indices is a big part of this. "If" part of a plan, then not coincidental timing with recent launch of oil mkt.
2954 2018-05-09 19:06:15 Yep.
Markets will be crazy.
Currency and oil price will be crazy too.

So guys, one change gonna takes a lot of difficulties to be stable and comfortable.

Ready for new era of Pakatan Harapan / ex- Pembangkang.
2955 2018-05-09 19:06:15 It's a rainy day over at Gothdrew towers. Does one go out in the rain with my Sisters of Mercy T shirt and get wet, or does one don my black trenchcoat and stay dry - but end up smelling and sweating  like a cross between Ghandi's flip flops and Patchouli oil? #GothProblems
2956 2018-05-09 19:06:11 Jann, do you know the difference between COAL and OIL???? It's not too far to understand that TAR is a derivative of COAL!!
2957 2018-05-09 19:05:54 Can the Russians use some of the extra cash higher oil proces will give them to get the TV host a new set of garanimals.
2958 2018-05-09 19:05:43 Oil money is what I would classify as their 'legend' tbh
2959 2018-05-09 19:05:31 have you access to drop of Poitín?
.Mix few drops lavender oil & rosemary oil in pint of it, rub on gently, the blended mix interacting will soothe pain,
.for ligament or tendon strain: salt+vinegar paste poultice, only thing known to 'repair' ligament,

2961 2018-05-09 19:05:15 Every one else seems to smuggle..when it serves them, even transferring oil at sea..when Iran does it I wonder if the outcry will be louder,
.
2962 2018-05-09 19:05:05 I am wondering does it make people feel good to involve themselves into ridiculous conspiracy theories.  The deal was a bad one for multiple reason. They were in violation of it. And Israel proved it. This isn't about oil.
2963 2018-05-09 19:05:03 I don't know about the Clintons having anyone murdered. Seems like a reach and an Alex Jones rant (he did do this). What I do know is the tire fire that is this Trump administration has so much smoke coming from it they are all choking. Keep selling that snake oil, Sarah Huckders

2967 2018-05-09 19:04:40 Don't know what's worse the ecological effect of palm oil or the shitty packaging. 
2968 2018-05-09 19:04:39 Many chemicals are made from crude oil, which is the residue of ancient organisms including zooplankton, ie tiny creatures. Hence, not really vegan.

2970 2018-05-09 19:04:36 Same here re lipid panel -- just took had blood drawn today for second lipid panel since going LCHF 2 years ago. Mildly curious about the results.  The main thing I've changed is that I tamped down butter, coc oil, and increased protein. Expecting GP to freakout as usual.
2971 2018-05-09 19:04:34 If anything, no matter how absurd, ridiculas or patently untrue passes a leftists lips, it becomes truth to the left.
2972 2018-05-09 19:04:27 I have to take a shower after I get my toes done I hate the feeling of massage oil on my legs and toes
2973 2018-05-09 19:04:25 Don’t worry he can buy Oil from Amazon at a cheaper price, the same way some people get toilets built for 6k from Online stores.

2976 2018-05-09 19:04:08 oh you know when many countries work diligently as a inspired and nonsensically disorganized unit to engorge and lubricate their war machines with oil...never only one
2977 2018-05-09 19:04:08 Yes indeed, Oil and Dollars. 
Iran upset the apple cart by wanting to trade oil in Euros
2978 2018-05-09 19:04:03 Not only does cooking save soo much money it also help u keep track of what u are putting into ur body. People ask me how am I able to fluctuate my weight .. I study food. I kno what bloat the stomach. I stay the fuck away& Unless I'm deep frying I don't use OIL & no carbs!
2979 2018-05-09 19:04:03 Finally getting an oil change. Probably waited to long 
2980 2018-05-09 19:04:00 i’m getting my wisdom teeth pulled out on friday.  @fakegamerdog says i can’t smoke weed for at least a week so i’m gonna do oil pulls with some weed coconut oil until then
2981 2018-05-09 19:03:52 Jojoba oil is the closest to the natural oil our skin produces. I  jojoba oil!
2982 2018-05-09 19:03:46 Anti-aging hand treatment - soak your hands in milk for 15 mins. Rinse then apply a bit of olive oil on them.
2983 2018-05-09 19:03:45 Bianchi Honda has the slowest oil changes ever. i made an appointment and it took 50 minutes. I’ve just walked into other places and been out in 20.
2984 2018-05-09 19:03:42 Or, if you have lots of oil to export.
2985 2018-05-09 19:03:40 "oil prices soar", a headline every american loves to see. you can send your thank you cards to @realDonaldTrump.
2986 2018-05-09 19:03:33 Andy.  Tsk tsk. You know you have avoided wading in on gas taxation. Don’t blame you at all. As prices for barrel of oil will surge I can’t find you perspective on weaning us away from fossil fuels. Big thinking Andy. What have you been developing?  Multi stage ? Multi yr?
2987 2018-05-09 19:03:31 Sadam's grievances for invading Kuwait were based on their lateral drilling of Iraqi Oil & Economic sabotage by Kuwait & UAE to Iraqi economy. The latter is now definitely applicable to Pakistan e.g. K-Electric purchased cheaply by UAE based fund; look at the econ. damage caused!
2988 2018-05-09 19:03:22 Destini Oil sounds familiar
2989 2018-05-09 19:03:16 Okay yes, I know that technically we don't get our oil from the Iranians, but I swear last week I bought a couple of quarts from one at a Seven-Eleven.
2990 2018-05-09 19:03:08  U.S. convincing China to cut its imports of Iranian oil now (China purchases about 24% of Iran’s oil exports)
2991 2018-05-09 19:03:08 My facial hair is so minimal that I bought castor oil 2 years ago and Its still half full 
2992 2018-05-09 19:03:06 Do you have proof? Why would he want to go in?

He is the only president in my lifetime to have actually complete campaign promises. One issue was to get out of the middle east. We never needed their oil. In 10 years we will be the #1 producer of Oil and Natural Gas.
2993 2018-05-09 19:02:56 It would be almost translucent. An oil
2994 2018-05-09 19:02:51 Buhari is an expatriate in Nigeria?! Most of those expatriate oil workers are kuku illiterates sha...
2995 2018-05-09 19:02:47 I need another oil change already. ..
2996 2018-05-09 19:02:45 How's Oil doing?
2997 2018-05-09 19:02:44 Yes please! Are you volunteering? I have the oil and I perfect sound track in mind 
2998 2018-05-09 19:02:39 I never said anything bout racism
Y’all still benefiting from wars in the MENA region
Slavelike working conditions in south east Asia etc
-> cheap oil prices, cheap clothing/technology n all that 
2999 2018-05-09 19:02:37 Question is who is buying oil at these prices without waiting for even a pullback. This price move has been very steep and very fast, It is scaring the crap out of me.
3000 2018-05-09 19:02:37 I have the same issue!! It’s sucks!! If I don’t bake the powder on my nose, it’s like a damn oil slick so even when I do wear dewy foundations they’re practically matte
3001 2018-05-09 19:02:26 Oil change, oil filter, air filter, fuel filter, 2 new fuel lines and chain clean/oil. And the bike started the first time. I'm as amazed as you.
3002 2018-05-09 19:02:16 i’ve been laying in the sun for three days straight with my tanning oil, and I still look like a marshmallow, but my boyfriend goes outside for 2 minutes and ends up looking like a perfectly golden grilled cheese and it’s just not fair
3003 2018-05-09 19:02:09 In Africa are minerals such as oil, copper, gold, diamonds, platinum and agricultural produce such as corn, coffee, wheat and fruits. Almost 65% of all Africans work in the agricultural sector. #CANFACTS

3005 2018-05-09 19:02:04 Why do you need gas when nuclear bombs are going off overhead? We will survive without Iranian oil. Iran needs the world more than the world needs Iran.
3006 2018-05-09 19:02:03 Other ideas include the use of battery storage systems in homes, using Tesla batteries, jet fuel production for oil sands using high tech MIT enclosed, environmentally secure storage and energy recyling capture, plus other ideas. Solar greenhouses function in Antarctica already:)
3007 2018-05-09 19:01:45 They weren't hostages,they were arrested & it's great they're released.The #OrangeMoron has destroyed future agreements for the U.S. by showing that they're not honored. #Boeing loses $20 billion contract that now goes to #Airbus and the price of oil goes up now
3008 2018-05-09 19:01:31 The oil price spike in 2008 did a lot of damage. Watch Venezuelan production
3009 2018-05-09 19:01:27 That makes perfect sense, especially with all the talk before the election on lifting the sanctions on the Russian oil companies.
3010 2018-05-09 19:01:27 Has anyone used CBD oil?

3017 2018-05-09 19:01:01 Actually, the correct pluralization is olives oil.

3019 2018-05-09 19:00:55 O/N Wrap:
Oil surges on declining US stockpiles (and a bit of Iran hangover), dragging equities along for the ride; NZD picks up currency of the day award, outpacing pretty much everything and eyeing a return to 0.7000.

Viewed correctly, everything done was legal at the time and considered necessary.
Spotless, CLASSIFIED record.
3026 2018-05-09 19:00:24 Russia is very happy with higher oil prices. Their economy is on life support.

3029 2018-05-09 19:00:18 I thought I was bad on cars , my momma done tore up one car I gave her for no oil & now finna tear up this one for no oil 
3030 2018-05-09 19:00:07 Oil prices soar after Trump dumps Iran nuclear deal. We can look to Trump's leadership for jacking up prices at the gas pump this summer. TYVM.

Jul 2008 (147.27) – Feb 2009 (33.55) = -77%
Oct 2000 (36.90) – Nov 2001 (17.12) = -54%
Commercials almost always ultimately correct.
3042 2018-05-09 18:59:06 I have to run errands and I have zero motivation.

3043 2018-05-09 18:58:53 Conservative ignorance at its finest. We don’t give them any funding. It’s Iranian assets that are frozen due to sanctions. Mainly in oil payments from Shell. The deal lifted those sanctions in exchange for inspections and giving 97% of their uranium enriched stockpile.
3044 2018-05-09 18:58:51 this cult wave of welcoming argon oil while cancelling coconut oil is such a LIE
3045 2018-05-09 18:58:46 oil and gas are not essential for us all.
3046 2018-05-09 18:58:41 The US pull out from the Iran deal means we’re likely to have sustained high oil prices this year. Funding will no longer be an excuse for this Admin. NNPC losses from sales of refined petrol (aka fuel subsidy) will however go up
3047 2018-05-09 18:58:35 How exactly did trump ravage Russia oil and gas industry. 

Not like they're an underage model.
3048 2018-05-09 18:58:33 Did you read this bit? 

"The main reason for this relative fall is the decline in the contribution of the North Sea, in turn a combination of a falling oil price and falling North Sea output."

What should the SNP have done about that? Aren't your party responsible for our oil?
3049 2018-05-09 18:58:25 yes. but not the leader, many things happen. 1 oil prices go up which is CRUCIAL to #Putin's economic stability as Russian Sanctions are affecting him & mostly his loyal oligarchs. 2nd knows it undermines U.S. credibilty Internationally & the Euro alliance(main win for "P")...

3054 2018-05-09 18:57:59 Shoot that idiot . Putting other workers safety at risk. We need more pipelines and refineries.  We import 20 times more oil in eastern canada .     Go get a job.
3055 2018-05-09 18:57:38 I accept the spending is ridiculous! That said we achieve our purchases, as do most other clubs in the Uk with our own ! Not just oil ! Nor do we get a best friend to sponsor the emptihad stadium & charge them £400m to do so

3064 2018-05-09 18:56:58 I have more odd & nefarious thoughts. Russia's paying NK, to bolster Trump's visuals. While it's a set up somewhere to get money making for the bunch of them.

Russia was spotted giving oil to NK against sanctions.

Memes of Kim as unstable as Trmp are false. He's a chess player.
3065 2018-05-09 18:56:58 I see Israel and Russia were jumping for joy today after your withdrawal of the Iran agreement. Putin is playing you like a fiddle. He can now sell all the weapons he wants now to Iran and flood the markets with oil. Just let’s see how much gas will cost in America  then
3066 2018-05-09 18:56:50 danm didnt you just get your car you got an oil change so soon so you ran the 3,000 miles already lol  you drive all day then lol
3067 2018-05-09 18:56:46 If we weren't there to be on the right side, then it was for oil, and to push the world to war because war makes money. Our soldiers are too honorable to be misled for the rich against what is right.  We may have to help trump clean the swamp to get on track.  I'll gladly watch.
3068 2018-05-09 18:56:44 But don't they have sort of opposing producer viewpoints on the longevity of US tight oil supply growth though? @RTDukes
3069 2018-05-09 18:56:42 Again, the delusional @CPC_HQ in House Of Commons wrongly claim that oil and gas should lead the Canadian economy. FACT: oil and gas caused the economy to decline and hundreds of jobs to be lost. No one wants pipelines and wants to diversify the economy. #bcpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM

3082 2018-05-09 18:55:52 No it’s absolutely true. Basic supply and demand. You cut off Iranian oil, prices will go up
3083 2018-05-09 18:55:41 I used to work in the National Gallery book shop and on my lunch break there was a  small book shop on Charing Cross Road that stocked Derek Jarman's books and I would buy them as they were published. My copy is stained with linseed oil and paint :)

3086 2018-05-09 18:55:34 Well that's about to happen. Effects? Meh, probably nothing except a bit more supply of crude that may not be currently priced in during the near term since Iran will be able to unload. But oil trade is absolutely dwarfed by the FX markets.
3087 2018-05-09 18:55:30 Oil settles 3% higher on U.S. exit from Iran deal
3088 2018-05-09 18:55:22 You people are delighted that a "Bernie candidate"lost. Manchin, will be the one voting YES to allow oil companies to dump in the water supply. Joe Manchin will be the one voting NO against Medicare for all, which would benefit WV greatly. Very telling of you bitter Hill types
3089 2018-05-09 18:55:18 @LBC Let's face it, if Iran was awash with oil, nobody would give a flying fuck whether it had nuclear capabilities or not !!
3090 2018-05-09 18:55:17 I’m not so sure if he is right on this one though. Iran is a country of Shias n less fanatic than Sunnis. Also Saudi exported more terror n is the source of wahabism but due to oil money, ppl r in denial. Saudi also supports many fanatic Muslim orgs in India.
3091 2018-05-09 18:55:16 I’m so sick of your twisted verbiage!  Let’s try it your way... “Paul Ryan and GOP are Selling Snake Oil at Discounted Rate.”  You are “entitled” to purchase.
3092 2018-05-09 18:55:14 Russia's state TV is having a panel discussion where to find 8 trillion rubles needed to implement Putin’s domestic policy goals. Host: "Looks like we found it. Trump is withdrawing US from the #Iran nuclear deal. Oil prices should go up, which is good for us."
3093 2018-05-09 18:55:12 Shouldn’t we be watching the oil to gold ratio in China?
3094 2018-05-09 18:55:11 Do u think that's possible even with oil continuing to rise? I am thinking that a correction in oil would likely be the catalyst although a correction in oil right now looks more like hope than a possibility. I am beginning to believe that the smart money/commercials are wrong.
3095 2018-05-09 18:54:52 Let’s suck all the oil out from underneath them!

3107 2018-05-09 18:54:06 A different perspective is that Iran will import more food etc. from India (4 Bn in FY14, FY 15) and hence Oil for food + keeping INR in designated banks will take Indias immediate usd buy demand out to the tune of ~ 8/9 Bn USD a year
3108 2018-05-09 18:54:04 Ive seen the proof of the oil in a cancer patient. She went from ICU at the hospital to being home andd functioning.

3110 2018-05-09 18:54:00 Incorrect. You saw how easily Saudi A. increased production in 2014 to kill prices. The only reason they cut it back since is to drive price up for their upcoming IPO. There is a ton of oil worldwide and many of us haven’t even scratched the surface on our reserves.
3111 2018-05-09 18:53:57 Unemployment/economy are trending exactly as they did before trump ran, thank BO. Pulling out of the Paris accord is awful unless you work in oil/gas or are under 60. And I must have missed the part where Islamic terrorist groups and illegal immigrants don’t exist anymore.

3162 2018-05-09 18:49:09 Eh, not really. More of the pressure against Iran is from the Saudis, nominally because of the Shai/Sunni division but more because Iran competes directly in the Oil market.

3195 2018-05-09 18:45:33 And oil prices going up 50% under Trump means gas prices are shortly spiking to $3.65 a gallon from $2.40: an additional $700/yr expense per average household.

Canceling out the entire #TaxCutsandJobsAct gain per the average household.

But the GOP doesn't talk about this.

3200 2018-05-09 18:44:46 Wondering how the recent spike in oil offsets the tax cuts for individuals? Anyone know of a good article?
3201 2018-05-09 18:44:36 Wrong again CNN.  Already went down. CNN are you even aware that Saudi Arabia wells are running dry and in the near future they will depend on the USA and Israel to supply gas and oil which means, guess what? See if you can guess You guys really look bad. And liberals r noticing
3202 2018-05-09 18:44:36 "Less oil on the world market"... except it seems the US has ramped up drilling and production activities. So from the supply side, this may help the US economy way more.

3212 2018-05-09 18:43:52 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
3213 2018-05-09 18:43:49 Well, since it pushes oil prices up & since Putin & a lot of Russian oligarchs are in the oil business.... 
Also, it further isolates USA from other western powers, which makes us weaker.
It's about Trump doing that Putin wants done. Vengeance against Obama is Putin's enticement
3214 2018-05-09 18:43:49 I told the PM that way before he even became the PM. No political will for a sustainable future as oil $$$$ companies here won’t be happy.

3217 2018-05-09 18:43:37 Special shoutout to the CBD oil I keep tucked away in my desk at work, a real life-saver that one.
3218 2018-05-09 18:43:36 Is destroying the environment with shale oil a good move for lower gas prices. Is destroying the environment for some magical clean coal, good for the economy. This is trumps agenda destroying things for short term gain. Which will come back to haunt trump supporters, long term

3221 2018-05-09 18:43:09 understanding economics is like having a superpower. Like I got an electric car a year ago because I knew oil would go back up...and it did!

3224 2018-05-09 18:42:26 So can we vote on the next sovereign nation that gets invaded? Is that how we settle this? Anger doesn't seem to be about the principle. Venezuela. Let's stick with the basic oil theme but then we can do the whole "not real socialism" and "not real imperialism" memes til we die

3229 2018-05-09 18:42:03 Reminder about Iran: In 1953, they had a comparatively progressive & pro-secular prime minister who wanted Iran to control its own oil. But the British, who controlled the oil, didn't like that. So Churchill got Eisenhower to help overthrow the prime minister in an illegal coup!
3230 2018-05-09 18:42:00 @Alex_Verbeek thanks for the follow. What's on your mind today? Me: thinking about whether surge in Oil prices merits getting back into Guggenheim Solar ETF (TAN) for a 6-12 month trade. Cheers & great to meet you virtually, FiClub Frank
3231 2018-05-09 18:41:58 Putting oil in tuna cans instead of water needs to be marked with a giant picture of a disgusting sandwich like when they put diseased lungs on cigarette packs in Europe.

3235 2018-05-09 18:41:38 b) A read in a famous Hungarian pomologist journal that in the latter case you should select a large root and cut it and treat the wound w. orange oil. This way the tree survival is threatened, so it should produce fruits & seeds.

3236 2018-05-09 18:41:37 I got so much to do over the next couple of days. Go pick up Khalil’s gift. Finish getting Angel’s Mother’s Day things. Get my nails done. Fix my hair. Get an oil change. I wish I had a clone. It’s the busiest I’ve been in weeks though. So I cannot complain!
3237 2018-05-09 18:41:36 Now that the Liar-in-Chief has abdicated USA leadership of the multilateral Iran deal, crude oil prices have surged to a 3 1/2 year high. Your gas prices will now go up more. That cancels out the so-called “middle class tax cut”.  Duh.

3239 2018-05-09 18:41:26 Iran would not be so antagonistic if US 1) didn't organize a coup after Iran refused to give UK companies priority in oil development and 2) didn't illegally steal billions of $ of iranian money.

3243 2018-05-09 18:41:00 Trump delivered what the Saudis wanted, destabilization and surgebin oil prices. ARAMCO must go out publicly at $100/barrel. In exchange, Jared gets rescued and Trump robs more treasure

3245 2018-05-09 18:40:51 I believeThe Iraq war produced far more enemies than were killed. There was no WMD & bin Laden was no friend of Saddam. Saddam was a bad actor, but ridding world of him gave power to Iran, his long time enemy. Our involvement in Middle East is chaotic/greed over oil. We pay!
3246 2018-05-09 18:40:47 Fully support your comment, 11 months ago I started a daily regimen of non thc isolate cbd oil and the changes I have felt are very measurable,  I didnt have debilitating pain but I had various issues and they are completely gone after yrs of dealing with it

3248 2018-05-09 18:40:42 U.S stocks advanced on Wednesday as a surge in oil prices boosted  energy stocks following President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw  the United States from a nuclear deal with Iran.
3249 2018-05-09 18:40:38 He thought the Iraq war was stupid because we didn't take the oil. It would be a war crime to do that but like he cares. That's what he meant by no more stupid wars.

3251 2018-05-09 18:40:36 WHAT WILL THE PRICE OF OIL BE, WHEN USA PRODUCES ALL THAT WE NEED? WHAT WILL THE COST OF GRAIN BE FOR EXPORT? MAYBE GRAIN PRICES SHOULD RISE NOW..MATTER OF FACT, ALL SANCTIONED GOODS?
3252 2018-05-09 18:40:33 I put olive oil on everything. It’s not bad. The first day I could have wheat again I had toast with olive oil and it was HEAVEN.
3253 2018-05-09 18:40:33 Oh, ya! Iran just coincidentally happens to be the 5th largest oil producer on Earth. Seem to recall a war with Iraq that also coincidentally has lots of oil. 
3254 2018-05-09 18:40:30 Lmao ! You're telling me ... I just got an oil change and filled up my tank yesterday and I was like wtf lmao

3266 2018-05-09 18:39:32 I suggest you look at many policies protecting Americans that Trump is annihilating without putting anything in their place. 10 million more uninsured today, a destabilize Middle East, and our national parks given to oil companies
3267 2018-05-09 18:39:31 So now the Dems are worried about the price of oil?!?  That's why we should stay in the Iran deal?!?  I'm very confused.  What happened to "no blood for oil" and "let's tax oil up the wazoo to combat climate change"?
3268 2018-05-09 18:39:30 Haha Iran will just sell their oil to China or Europe. Just as with tRump's stupid trade wars the only people that suffer are the American consumer. #gasprices
3269 2018-05-09 18:39:22 Should have stopped weaning off the tit that is oil long ago.. not sustainable

3272 2018-05-09 18:39:07 I'll like to revise the forecast I made regarding US retail in 2018. Considering the drop in disposable income from rising oil prices and growing inflation/ interest rates, I believe those effects will nullify benefits from tax cuts so I am no longer bullish about this sector
3273 2018-05-09 18:39:05 Peak oil! Peak oil!

3284 2018-05-09 18:37:58 Yep, @Khanoisseur nailed it. If you want understand anything about Trump actions, follow the money. I suppose it doesn't hurt that there is oil in Iran. Didn't oil have something to do with the US invading Iraq? It feels like deja vu.
3285 2018-05-09 18:37:57 Oil companies frequently cap new productive wells. Keeps the federal lease rates down. If the feds know an area is productive, rates go up. Tool pushers used to radio in fake data, then scramble legit numbers.

3298 2018-05-09 18:37:12 Why does Iran need nuclear power anyway I have to ask. They have all the oil for heating and so on. They just don't want to look stupid I guess when it comes to nuclear power. well, shall Mr. Netanyahu give back his nuclear arsenal too, if he has one.
3299 2018-05-09 18:37:11 It’s my day off and I still went to work to help out now I’m getting an oil change and then I have to finish moving out of my apartment. I’m tired and I wanna die

3305 2018-05-09 18:36:40 I disagree.  He is dishonest and uninformed.  He is damaging the US image around the world which in turn is making China stronger. Go learn about the "basket of currencies" that now can be used instead of US dollars. And that includes buying oil

Fish Oil helps provide EPA and DHA, two essential fatty acids, that dramatically improve brain functionand and reduce inflammation. However the quality matters, it's better to not take fish oil than to take bad fish oil.
3318 2018-05-09 18:35:50 Thanks for putting us, once again, at the brink of war in the Middle East. And now Israel has been greenlighted to attack Syria at will.  Oil prices will soon sky rocket.  MAGA is a lie as your REAL priority is to push Bibi SatanYahoo's agenda.  Sad.
3319 2018-05-09 18:35:42 He trying to twist it on how it will affect the fuel subsidy, because when oil is high gas prices are high everywhere.  He not seeing the big picture yet. Hopefully his advisors will keep him up-to-date w/ the Iran Deal.
3320 2018-05-09 18:35:38 According to @nytpolitics “With a population of about 82 million and substantial oil reserves, Iran represented a largely untouched market with the potential for fast growth, a rare opportunity for Western companies with global ambitions”

3326 2018-05-09 18:35:13 Yeah see how you end up! And @POTUS will take the oil!!
3327 2018-05-09 18:35:13 Because Russia helped bigly to elect @POTUS in return for dropping sanctions imposed by Obama and other considerations - note much higher oil prices greatly help Russia - paying more for gas? Thank Daffy Donald @FoxNews @AP

3335 2018-05-09 18:34:44 So the food mayor of Vancouver is encouraging disobedience against the kinder Morgan pipeline he should remember you can’t have your cake and eat it to maybe eastern Canada will fight to disallow oil imports and foreign coal exports wonder will that stop tourism #boycottBC

3341 2018-05-09 18:34:14 Absolute victory over the current tyrannical Iranian govt is all that WILL “fix things”.  Expect Russia to turn its back on its Iranian “friends” after they sell them inferior arms.  Russia needs high oil prices. When Iran is bombed offline there’ll be less oil and higher prices.
3342 2018-05-09 18:34:07 @RosaTaggart The NDP are doing a great job now by ushering in the TransMountain #pipeline. Alberta's joblessness has to do with the drop in the world price of oil, not Alberta politics. @BlanchardSL #yyc

3392 2018-05-09 18:29:59 So! The mandate this gov't was elected to was to address climate change. They were very clear about that and many Provincial and Municipal gov'ts have echoed the same. It can't be a surprise to the oil and gas sector. Other areas of our economy are performing very strongly!
3393 2018-05-09 18:29:53 We should not have to depend on foreign oil, but political parties have put so much regulations in drilling that its cheaper to import oil. UNBELIEVABLE!

3414 2018-05-09 18:28:32 Or perhaps because oil prices will go up now, which makes rich oil producers richer......

3423 2018-05-09 18:27:40 $2 billion is pocket change for the Iranian government.  Iran is the 5th largest oil producer. Why would they want bitcoin? Pivot sanctions. You bet Bitcoin prices and the whole crypto market is gonna rocket in the near future.
3424 2018-05-09 18:27:40 Wow, @Garnhiem_ has a weird timeline, very interested in Venezuelan oil resources it seems.
3425 2018-05-09 18:27:37 Focus on the word could. It means Iran can't sell 2.1 million barrels of oil a day n use the money to kill Americans. Saudis n other gulf state's will replace that oil. Leftist trying to steer the narrative? Trumped again

3439 2018-05-09 18:25:48 @RayAppletonKMJ So, is the US letting Isreal attack Iran.  Do they want Iran to strike back? If yes then they will have an excuse to go after Iran.  There's a lot of oil in Iran we want control over. The British (BP) had control until the 1979 revolution.
3440 2018-05-09 18:25:45 20. People would be better able to afford food if they are able to spend less on health care.  Pollution from coal, oil increases   health care costs by trillions of dollars over time.  USA could obtain most of its electricity needs, other energy needs fuel from hemp.

3453 2018-05-09 18:24:32 Indeed. The MAGAts have no ability to view the situation objectively. This is a HUGE win for oil exporters & a huge loss for American consumers. 

But they can't see it inside #Cult45. 

Maybe getting hit in their wallet will wake them up? At least some if them.

3455 2018-05-09 18:24:15 There are already other solutions than solar inc: wind, wave and geothermal. But the real issue I believe is getting the governments to push these alternatives rather that keeping the oil and gas companies happy (just a personal view).

3466 2018-05-09 18:23:25 I hear it helps his friend Putin with oil . And will cause gas prices in the US and Canada to increase more. Can’t wait for him to justify that 
3467 2018-05-09 18:23:13 Read the labels. It can be hidden as veg. oil so look for saturated fats.
3468 2018-05-09 18:23:02 You're correct. I hope there not on that downslide now. Once oil prices kick up and the tax scam is shown for what it is then,,,
3469 2018-05-09 18:22:55 The US now produces the same amount of oil a day as Russia.  So how does it help Putin to put pressure on his ally (Iran) to get the hell out of Syria, Iraq and Yemen? Our other middle eastern allies would like to know?
3470 2018-05-09 18:22:55 How bad is it to wait after the mileage they told you come back to get an oil change ?
3471 2018-05-09 18:22:53 @ananavarro Is POTUS manipulating the price of oil to support his pro-coal and pro US oil by walking away from the Iran deal? Hard to trust his motivations in just about everything.
3472 2018-05-09 18:22:51 Higher oil price allows Shale producers to build up profits and reserves. Allows more exploration to be funded. Helps KSA to fund their deficits and buy more arms... He is looking at geopolitics with an economic point of view.

3482 2018-05-09 18:21:42 We've always been asked by people involved! So VietNam, Iraq, Kuwait etc etc etc. We built the oil fields in Saudi Arabia and all over and taught how to get oil out of ground.
3483 2018-05-09 18:21:36 Syria isn't a "client state" of Russia and in fact they don't even sell much oil to Russia so I'm not convinced by that. I get that you want to make a nuanced "both sides" argument but it all sounds very much like an episode of South Park to me.
3484 2018-05-09 18:21:35 Yeah I’m aware of that... but those people were Syrian, not Afghani or Iraqi, yet we went to Iraq and Afghanistan, which also happen to hold huge oil preserves for “WMD’s” and “terrorism” when 9/11 hijackers were Syrian, not all the countries in the Middle East are the same place

オリーブ油は、オリーブの果実から得られる植物油である。
3488 2018-05-09 18:21:11 Girl, if you don’t see what is really happening right before your very eyes then there is no hope for you. Everything has been planned out, step by step, carefully by Russia and China. Trump is just a pawn. This is all about oil and nothing else. Controlling oil=power
3489 2018-05-09 18:21:11 Haven't tried it yet Gerrid. I'd disagree on the oil though, washed off the oil covered steering box on our old greasy tandem last night and there wasn't even a film left. I hope it works on seed treatment bc that would make post seeding life much easier lol.
3490 2018-05-09 18:21:03 Public Works has identified and received complaints on several old, decrepit and unsafe dust control spots @StettlerCounty . Council voted in favor of contacting landowners at these sites, and notifying  oil dust control will be ripped up - and advising them of alternatives.
3491 2018-05-09 18:21:00 Well what i would do is do the pose in the mirror and see how much oil looks and then try to mix it up from there till it seems right.

3493 2018-05-09 18:20:48 I am proud of myself: today I made the perfect omelette. It was fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside. It contained: dried tomatoes, basil, pepper, salt, olive oil, and lamb cheese.
3494 2018-05-09 18:20:41 Oil Fever
3495 2018-05-09 18:20:36 ***you don’t care***
If we want to save the planet then we are better off building pipelines and exporting Canadian oil. If we don’t then the demand will be met by other nations with laughable environmental oversight.

3499 2018-05-09 18:20:20 Here's an idea: All Americans should reduce our reliance on oil. Hurts #Russia and all #OPEC countries in one fell swoop while helping the environment. #Logic
3500 2018-05-09 18:20:15 Palm Oil is everywhere, in everything. very hard to avoid. there needs to be legislation

3502 2018-05-09 18:20:00 So instead of putting in a market based solution that provides incentive to oil companies to emit less through lower costs\higher profits, the #CPC wants Taxpayers to give subsidies to oil companies through tax breaks for those that chose to emit less?  #cdnpoli

3509 2018-05-09 18:19:16 I guess the headache for everyone who agrees with the notion is how to move away from trading oil in $$ (which they are already trying to do anyway)

3511 2018-05-09 18:19:05 Because a) it uncouples the US and Europe and b) it sends oil prices up, relieving the pressure on Putin's ramshackle economy

Unstable ground that is contaminated with petroleum, or oil byproducts.   You can also get gas leakage from old mines. These can be expensive when preparing the site area. .... HH

Increasing cost to bussiness, retention of useless employees

3521 2018-05-09 18:18:21 And anyone investing in oil, oil companies, oil futures, etc. Possibly trumpy companies
3522 2018-05-09 18:18:16 Oil prices soar after Trump dumps Iran nuclear deal Thanks, Trump, for raising those gas prices. How about raising the minimum wage to cover it? All I hear is sileance on that one.
3523 2018-05-09 18:18:10 By focusing exclusively on the role of ROs, instead of reviewing, say, the respective roles of the private & public (in the form of @CoastGuardCAN) sectors, Ottawa’s in effect abdicating the responsibility it currently has vis a vis marine oil spill response. This is unfortunate.
3524 2018-05-09 18:18:10 Indeed.  Putin's Mafia State doesn't take sides. Taking sides is so cold war. Putin's Mafia State only wants instability. And a high oil price.
3525 2018-05-09 18:18:05 Strong day on Wall Street wrongly attributed to oil strength. Part of the story but more broadly based. NASDAQ outperforming S&P and Dow.  Key resistance broken and some way off year highs. Further  to go but watch  the 10 year yield which lurks ominously at 2.99%.
3526 2018-05-09 18:18:02 There is a balance between Alberta pumping oil to fund their budget, the feds getting taxes to benefit all of us, Kinder Morgan making money, AND BC’s environment being protected by more than vague promises that aren’t enforceable.

3528 2018-05-09 18:17:59 They taking too long to change my oil. I’m ready to go
3529 2018-05-09 18:17:51 Its Proganda they've been doing all these years. If they really wanted to do something to the US they would have done it a long time ago. War is being planned against Iran for the usual OIL.
3530 2018-05-09 18:17:48 Perhaps it is (well past) time for Americans to reduce their reliance on oil. By doing so, we would hurts all #OPEC countries and #Russia in one fell swoop while helping the environment. #Logic

3535 2018-05-09 18:17:24 Not for me
Fire lit speckled grass,
Browned in oil,
And petrol spun,
The drone of engines 
In collision, in lanes,
And lorries in the air,
The marshes in dread
An ancient ground,
Of footprints, rare,
Of misery, unshared 
Land, so rare.

3538 2018-05-09 18:17:10 Man I’m at the crib changing my oil and filters and had to go to CarX just for the mf to give me a service charge for something I could’ve literally did myself if he had told me how

3542 2018-05-09 18:16:32 With the US withdrawal from Iran nuclear deal, oil reached above $70/ barrel again, first time in 4 years. OPEC & Russia cutting production, Great news for oil producing nations like Venezuela, Nigeria, Libya and T&T that are facing economic challenges. 
3543 2018-05-09 18:16:29 If the Saudis want their oil competition neutralized they can do it themselves and leave the US out of it.
3544 2018-05-09 18:16:23 I’ll just leave this here. 

#Putin has been hurt by low oil prices. 

@POTUS killing the Iran deal pushes up oil prices.

sea of lies.
3553 2018-05-09 18:15:25 This guy along with the former mayor of Montreal are hoping they can get a share of the oil revenues through their province. If such an offer was made you would see them turn their back on the environment instantly.
3554 2018-05-09 18:15:21 We dont care. We prefer to save the planet. The job of Canadians is to close the oil patch ASAP.
3555 2018-05-09 18:15:21 I'm talking coconut oil, sweet almond oil, stuff that smells good...way better than something used by someone who rides a velocipede in the city would use.
3556 2018-05-09 18:15:19 Check your Transmission oil this weekend.
3557 2018-05-09 18:14:50 A different perspective is that Iran will import more food etc. from India (4 Bn in FY14, FY 15) and hence Oil for food + keeping INR in designated banks will take Indias immediate usd buy demand out to the tune of ~ 8/9 Bn USD a year
3558 2018-05-09 18:14:49 either that or Japan actually cares about imported oil prices
3559 2018-05-09 18:14:48 2.5 tomatoes + maybe 1/4 cup of oil + some sugar + spices + a blender + pinch of cornstarch and voila; I got maybe 16-18ozs of tomato sauce

3567 2018-05-09 18:14:12 But of course. We knew this when the nation sitting on top of half the world's oil & gas and situated perfectly for 100% solar expressed an interest in nuclear power generation, with assistance from Michael Flynn & Putin. Cover for weapons development. Nothing more.
3568 2018-05-09 18:14:11 I think oil moves on other issues.
3569 2018-05-09 18:13:58 Idea: Bromakase. It's about 12 courses of sliders (wagyu beef, pulled pork, fried chicken) paired with truffle oil fries, dank IPAs, and a discussion of the Jason Bourne series.
3570 2018-05-09 18:13:56 Hudema-bot spammed this same lie yesterday. It's actually 600 barrels of oil.
3571 2018-05-09 18:13:51 I will give you Isis but Korea is still unknown and tax cuts only if you are rich or a big Corp. Summer gas prices will wipe out any gains for middle class. Oil has doubled in the last few months.
3572 2018-05-09 18:13:49 @BarclaysUK Is there some kind of account for Janet Galina Brown. She is from Moscow. Her father was supposed to be invested in the oil business. I think the amount is supposed to be $25 million dollars. Barrister Tony Anderson is handling matters for her. Am I being scammed?
3573 2018-05-09 18:13:35 I love this story because something similar happened to me years ago. I am a MUSTARD guy, through and through, but got the oil & mayo with it once because my brother basically forced me to. and OH. MY GOD. Sandwich nirvana.

3580 2018-05-09 18:12:37 Short term, I’d be trading on oil. Longer term, gold is a good play on the inevitable US inflation due the structure fiscal imbalance.

3585 2018-05-09 18:12:12 The US has been exporting excess oil drilled here at home and decreasing oil imports. Less Iranian oil shouldn’t affect domestic drilling or refinement but the price of gas at the pump will be raised with the companies making false shortage claims!

3616 2018-05-09 18:10:04 Stock market ignores 10-year yield at 3% to surge to session peak as oil rises to $71/bbl, in late-day action
3617 2018-05-09 18:10:01 We are producing our own oil now
It's summer... gas prices always go up in the summer.

But please.... keep spinning @cnn.  Your rating are heading towards Minus
3618 2018-05-09 18:09:47 $CL_F Wait, weren’t we using Oil as a proxy for global growth not so long again? Why has that changed now?
3619 2018-05-09 18:09:41 A machine that reflects the belief bias of humans programming it.
Just plain creepy and something I wouldn't want anywhere near me.
3620 2018-05-09 18:09:38 #opec got lucky with high oil prices. The collapse in #Venezuelan output has reduced production much more than intended and caused global oil inventories to draw down much faster. All about timing. #oott $wti $bno
3621 2018-05-09 18:09:37 I dont believe its that simple. in the internet age anyone who wants to know the costs or war can find them in seconds. but we as people want our cheap oil and honestly a lot of it is simply devaluing and blatantly hating the "other", in this case Muslims.

3623 2018-05-09 18:09:29 When I was inHouston I had taken a pay cut for over a year. But if you work in oil & gas you’d know that a paycut outweighs no job at all. Now that I’m not there, I’m getting so many emails for positions that would have been a substantial raise. *sighs
3624 2018-05-09 18:09:28 funny how they do know but pro-pipeliners keep insisting that they don’t. Same as stopping all oil when it’s expansion that people are against.
3625 2018-05-09 18:09:27 Well, for starters Dick Cheney and his "Dark State Actors" in Genie Energy are closer to drilling for oil in the Golan Heights after Israel seizes more land from Syria. This was a big signal to BiBi that Trump backs that plan.
3626 2018-05-09 18:09:23 Surprise surprise, crude oil prices up 3% post Iran statement #c4news
3627 2018-05-09 18:09:16 I may have read it wrong, but if I didn't, Boeing is going to lose $20 Billion worth of orders.  How many American Jobs is that?  How many for Airbus?  
As oil prices skyrocket, how many jobs is that going to cost?  Big business doesn't like full employment, cost them more...
3628 2018-05-09 18:09:15 Consider this President Trump's impetus to reduce Americans' reliance on oil. Long overdue.
3629 2018-05-09 18:09:12 Violating the Iran deal is all about raising oil prices to salvage the Russian economy, right? Anybody?
3630 2018-05-09 18:09:11 Indeed the only rich non-democracy that doesn’t export oil. A city state is perhaps just different (especially when as well governed as Singapore has been)

3635 2018-05-09 18:08:56 Of course I am sure all the best and brightest minds in the lucrative oil and gas industry will flock to the socialist paradise to rake in $2 a month. #Venezuela
3636 2018-05-09 18:08:53 Kym Herjavic's recipe
1 banana, mashed
1-2 eggs
1 pinch baking powder (not soda)

Oil pan by adding a smidge and wiping it around with a paper towel. Pour them palm-sized. They are thin and brown quickly. I melt some creamy peanut butter in the microwave to use as syrup.
3637 2018-05-09 18:08:53 Then China will block us out of the market for oil.  You can't simultaneously fight *against* renewable energy and *for* leaving the Middle East to be taken over by Chinese interests.

3639 2018-05-09 18:08:46 Did u thank Putin? Putin told NK if they still wanted Russia help with food/oil/nuke info/etc..they have to help trump look good. Putin told NK to free the 3 men. Putin told NK 2 work with SK temporarily.
3640 2018-05-09 18:08:37 This is Trump and the oil industries way of starting a war to cover-up corruption and to take Middle Eastern Oil.  

Impeach this oil corrupt so-called Administration before they kill us all.

3643 2018-05-09 18:08:25 cars are expensive!!! i’ve been needing an oil change for forever but I can’t afford one rn 
3644 2018-05-09 18:08:23 Here's an idea: Reduce your reliance on oil. Hurts all #OPEC countries in one fell swoop while helping the environment. #Logic
3645 2018-05-09 18:08:10 i put some wild growth oil in my braids last night & this nigga asked me why my head smelled like vick’s  . i put the bottle down this morning . i ain’t fucking with it no more 
3646 2018-05-09 18:07:53 if you used your brain instead of your oil to negotiate you wouldn’t be in this predicament now would you?
3647 2018-05-09 18:07:52 Haven't heard much about Tesla's electric tractor trailer in a while, with rising oil prices at the moment I thought I would for sure hear something about it
3648 2018-05-09 18:07:52 Oh I see. So since Kim doesn’t have control of the oil he’s okay. Only the dictators that murder and torture their own people AND control oil are the ones that deserve to be captured and executed for their crimes? Gotcha 
3649 2018-05-09 18:07:49 Nothing makes sense anymore Steph....tsla valuation, $wdc and $mu and $dal pe ratios, dollar and oil rising together, Trump approval ratings anything above 2 pct. I don't understand anything anymore.
3650 2018-05-09 18:07:44 we’re oil live 
3651 2018-05-09 18:07:35 How can you ever be trusted again?
3652 2018-05-09 18:07:31 Keep having oil prices rise up and you are going to destroy this Economy and No one is going to vote for Republicans.. The reason we have a booming Economy is low Oil Prices...
3653 2018-05-09 18:07:31 Would you agree financialism have siphoned off too much the oil of capitalism?
3654 2018-05-09 18:07:30 Hey that’s my line against that oil slick sack of shit.

3657 2018-05-09 18:07:21 Reminds me of how my heart sank when I found a mostly-empty oil bottle in my new(used) car...of the wrong oil. At least it was 5W-30 instead of 5W-20, so not nearly as bad as yours.

3659 2018-05-09 18:07:05 Who sets to gain if #iran exports less oil? #Saudi Arabia and its close allies Abu Dhabi and Kuwait hold almost all the spare capacity that could respond quickly to a reduction in Iranian exports. #US #shale producers could also increase their output. #oott $wti $bno #energy

3662 2018-05-09 18:06:51 The narrative is that Iranian and Venezuelan oil being restricted do to statements from Trump. I agree that that is overly optimistic, but that's the sentiment the market is running on.
3663 2018-05-09 18:06:50 Stop drilling, you’ve struck oil. Is his evil power ‘chaffing?’

3665 2018-05-09 18:06:41 You can buy Caivil Fusion oil. It's under R30. It's a fusion of different oils - black castor oil, coconut oil, argan oil, peppermint oil etc. This one is my go-to oil.

3667 2018-05-09 18:06:31 So is steel products..oil pipe , casing etc...
3668 2018-05-09 18:06:29 I don't know man... I saw oil behave the same way in January. That's what's making me think it's similar. But maybe it is different this time.
3669 2018-05-09 18:06:20 Haha. Top tip : just put everything back in bowl , add eggs, warm oil in a pan, put oil in muffin tray, add the mixture.  Tastes alright
3670 2018-05-09 18:06:18 $EPE - man can't believe this thing might actually be going green for me.  Bought it last year when I incorrectly thought oil was headed up.....guess oil had to head up sometime.

3673 2018-05-09 18:05:54 Oil comes from the Earth; &should belong to ALL Earthlings. Corrupt govts give away natural resources for mere pennies to unscrupulous, greedy corporations; who have made trillions$ in profit.

3683 2018-05-09 18:05:09 Interesting that threat to Iran immediately increases price of oil. Russian economy nearly totally reliant on oil revenue and has struggled since its been low 
3684 2018-05-09 18:05:05 I agree. First thing we must do is STOP CHEMTRAILS! Stop using pesticides like Glyphosate. STOP FUKUSHIMA irradiation. STOP OIL PIPELINES! Any questions?
3685 2018-05-09 18:04:55 What control does this "master deal maker" have to control iran's behavior now? This is a big joke. When are people with common sense and goodwill going to stop this BS from this "snake oil salesman"?

3695 2018-05-09 18:03:50 Because they both restrict sugar and omega 6 seed oils - which we did not evolve to eat. But instead, the animal rights issues make the epidemiology focus on the meat consumption instead of the sugar/seed oil consumption. That's not science - that's religion.

3698 2018-05-09 18:03:22 Oil prices soar after Trump dumps Iran nuclear deal, these are the headlines this morning. 
Now can someone tell me WHY? We have enough oil in this county that we don't need to import, so why is "Oil Prices Soaring"?

3701 2018-05-09 18:03:00 It's important to have your brakes checked AT LEAST once every six months, but it is better to have them looked at each time you get an oil change to make sure everything is in working order. Keep your vehicle in tip-top shape with a call to us today - (972) 540-0222
3702 2018-05-09 18:02:45 Wow,we may need some more Troops and a few more Clapped out Land Rovers to deal with this lot.Thanks to Boris Johnson and the PM,We have made a Bad Enemy, Guess we should pull out the stops,get Fracking, We may need oil and it will not be coming from Iran
3703 2018-05-09 18:02:45 Well I guess the supply is not dictated by the oil companies? Hard for me to believe we are pumping record oil and prices are rising crazy.
3704 2018-05-09 18:02:33 i actually had to jumpstart my 2006 chevy cobalt yesterday because the battery died. it also needs an oil change and 2 blinkers are out

3726 2018-05-09 18:00:39 The current price of crude oil is $72 per barrel not $66. Exchange rate is not at ₹45=$1 as it is not in our hands. Foreign exchange rate works through price mechanism that is through demand & supply. Slightly weak exchange rate is healthy for exports of any country.

3730 2018-05-09 18:00:12 Another C_A failure that has bankrupted the US for the last 30+ yrs. while the oil sheiks became rich beyond their wildest dreams funding jihadism against the US.
3731 2018-05-09 18:00:11 oil: ((((((
3732 2018-05-09 18:00:11 Presumably Trump will forbid banks and lean on SWIFT to ban all bank t/fs. Deals with Iran will then only take place via China. Already yuan/oil contract vol has taken off. Plays into China's hands wrt replacing petrodollar. Gold?

3739 2018-05-09 17:59:56 The fact that gas prices will go up is a perk if you work for an oil company. You know, like most of this administration. #FollowTheMoney #fossilfuels #profitsüberalles #screwtheenvironment #climatechange #andmoreclimatechange
3740 2018-05-09 17:59:47 Also suspicious that threat to Iran immediately hits oil price. Russian economy nearly totally reliant on oil revenue.

3742 2018-05-09 17:59:31 Iran deal positive or negative for MTN? Sanctions vs Oil price under pin... your thoughts please?
3743 2018-05-09 17:59:27 You would think he or some cabinet members have buddies in the oil business..
3744 2018-05-09 17:59:25 The Government Pension Fund Global is saving for future generations in Norway. One day the oil will run out, but the return on the fund will continue to benefit the Norwegian population.

3746 2018-05-09 17:58:53 Follow the money trail.  Oil is going up, ARAMCO IPO is worth more billions, #Trump needs external threat since N. Korea is making up with S. Korea , needs billions of dollars for the Industrial Complex to overhaul his aging nuclear arsenal.
3747 2018-05-09 17:58:50 Looks like a nice place to explore for oil.
3748 2018-05-09 17:58:45 Wanna know why gas prices are climbing at an alarming rate? Our dumbass POTUS is cutting ties with two of the largest oil producers in the world. Glad I’ll barely be able to keep a fucking Kia Soul on the road.
3749 2018-05-09 17:58:44 I got the same symptoms. I’ve stopped smoking for A min now and noticed a change ima try the olive oil too & Going to the doc
3750 2018-05-09 17:58:39 Oil at all time high this year as the United States pulls out of the international nuclear deal with Iran, OPEC's third largest producer. The move is expected to escalate the risk of conflict in the Middle East & consequently create uncertainty over global oil supplies.
3751 2018-05-09 17:58:32 This isn't about democracy or arms. It's one thing and one thing only. Follow the money. Last week, Iran switched from dollars to Euro for oil sales. the US cannot allow the loss of the USD as the reserve currency, to do so would end their hegemony & empire. #money #war
3752 2018-05-09 17:58:28 That wee Margret at asda is awfa stingy with the chilli oil on pizzas man
3753 2018-05-09 17:58:28 Anyways you people should collect your money then come and buy perfume oil so you will smell good 
3754 2018-05-09 17:58:18 The #soundsleepcocoon from @dermalogicasa has encapsulated MOTION ACTIVATED Lanandin Oil (lavender) that sits on the surface of the skin imparting the scent of lavender all night long. This is very innovative for a beauty product.
3755 2018-05-09 17:58:15 How long before Trump starts talking about lifting the drilling sanctions on Russia (that caused Exxon to pull out of its joint venture with Rosneft) as a way of addressing the inevitably lower oil supply from Iran due to the U.S. breaking the Iran deal?
3756 2018-05-09 17:58:04 Sjoo I've heard of the oil. Iyadura akere? Does Clicks sell it? Will start plaiting amagoda maybe zizokhula
3757 2018-05-09 17:58:03 It just so happens that a good friend of mine a nephew of the Nigerian Oil Minister is looking for someone to assist in an international money transfer - I’ll ask him to get in touch!
3758 2018-05-09 17:58:01 Soy oil aka liquid estrogen.
3759 2018-05-09 17:57:50 I forgot I had 6 free oil changes!!
3760 2018-05-09 17:57:46 I think coconut oil is good for getting it off
3761 2018-05-09 17:57:41 And once the horses are gone, they’re coming for the livestock because oil is more profitable than cattle and sheep.
3762 2018-05-09 17:57:40 Anyone look at the price of oil today? 3% the bounce they were looking for?
@maddow @jaketapper
3763 2018-05-09 17:57:37 @realDonaldTrump I understand your position. You have Iran up in arms for this situation with no helpful alternative to their oil dependency. It's a methodology though, solar is a great alternative to nuclear.
3764 2018-05-09 17:57:32 Afinal qual será o driver para o $Oil no mundo? Os Saudistas tentaram inflacionar e não foram bem sucedidos. Irã? Demanda da  ? Da  ? Uma coisa é certa: O “mundo” quer esse driver e isso vai acabar rolando como sempre, de onde menos esperarmos. @marciopdn2
3765 2018-05-09 17:57:27 so. today cannibis oil was delivered for my boss and she hits me with "im scared to use it". the amount of willpower it took to not say "UHM GIVE IT TO ME" is fucking ridiculous.
3766 2018-05-09 17:57:24 I put the conditioner and oil in my head then sit under a heated conditioning cap
3767 2018-05-09 17:57:22 Who is responsible for the price of oil going up?
3768 2018-05-09 17:57:21 #mecfs people. CBD oil really helping with pain levels. Worth a shot.
3769 2018-05-09 17:57:15 Permian differentials of over $15 relative to the Gulf Coast are a positive indicator for global oil prices, as growth will be somewhat limited in the basin by transportation and production bottlenecks.  Also bullish for crude focused MLPs. #oil #MLP
3770 2018-05-09 17:57:15 Don't forget that it helps Saudi Arabia in their long standing fight with Iran plus the oil price rises we are already seeing happen.

Israel get their way. Hell even Russia gets some benefit from oil price rises (or at least Putins chums do).
3771 2018-05-09 17:57:07 Dear @Flipkart I've ordered a hair oil which I received is fake product and in leaked manner. And it smells like #allout mosquito repellent liquid. What products do u sell yaar?

3775 2018-05-09 17:56:29 Motion activated lavender and sandalwood oil - I love this! The more I move (I sleep quite rough) the more capsules will break... yay!
3776 2018-05-09 17:56:28 Trump owes the oil  company's. Trumps contributors don't only want a tax break but they want yours too!
3777 2018-05-09 17:56:15 What do they use for fuel to park their vans to stop exploration?? Yep oil YOU COULD NOT MAKE IT UP
3778 2018-05-09 17:56:12 10w-60? thats a pretty heavy oil, may i ask what car do you drive?
3779 2018-05-09 17:56:10  Wow. thank you girl. I don't know what tips to give you specifically. But try using Jamaican Black Castor oil for rich texture & growth. Mine's naturally thick so I no longer use it.
3780 2018-05-09 17:55:58 Oh, another 1 who doesn't understand simple econ. Obama didn't just pull out of the Iran deal, which is sending the Oil prices skyrocketing. But, I get it.. never the CONservative's fault they failed. it's always someone else's. The party of personal Respon, is the blame party.
3781 2018-05-09 17:55:57 Then as now, the #Europeans had a lot to lose. The EU is one of the largest markets for Iranian petroleum products. European multinationals like French oil major #Total and aircraft maker #Airbus have announced billions of dollars in deals since sanctions ended in 2016.
3782 2018-05-09 17:55:56 $KMI they will get it done. Need China to buy our oil.
3783 2018-05-09 17:55:48 Haha. It was from 2014. Before our time. Before the oil crash. Apparently they have 6 strips club for the 200,000 residents making it the most clubs per capita in the UK. #themoreyouknow

3787 2018-05-09 17:55:42 Obama gets credit for an oil price war? "You can't credit or blame the president [for the oil boom]," said Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst with the Oil Price Information Service. "It's been the twin pillars of price and technology. It's capitalism at work."
3788 2018-05-09 17:55:37 Well if you use plain oil theyre vegan
3789 2018-05-09 17:55:34 There's evidence to suggest that if you have never used moisturiser you are better off not starting, imbalances natural oil production on the skin.
3790 2018-05-09 17:55:32 It normally says on the oil fill cap what weight oil to use. Does yours not say that?

3797 2018-05-09 17:54:49 We have a personal relationship with tech.  Oil is "$4.00 a gallon?! You assholes!"
3798 2018-05-09 17:54:48 I have no sympathy for people who get impatient waiting for a car service. If you don’t like waiting, do it yourself. 

Oh, you don’t know how to change your oil or do a tire rotation? Cool! Then sit there, stop complaining, go get a complimentary Coke, and shut TF up.

3800 2018-05-09 17:54:29 Thank you.  Candle dressing is not always covered in books.  I used to oil mine, but I didn't know the proper way.  Might have had better results had I known the proper procedure...
3801 2018-05-09 17:54:18 Trying hard not to doze off while I wait for my oil change.

3807 2018-05-09 17:53:04 Somehow it’ll be Obama’s faculty,or we’ll be in a war and unfocused.Meanwhile the oil companies make out like bandits.The greed (trumpism) of this country,along with the toss off of normal civilized behavior (trumpism) is setting back this country to the worse of the 1890-1930[s
3808 2018-05-09 17:52:57 Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf states are happy we rescinded the Iran Agreement and promised to increase production. We lived for 25 years without Iranian oil and I doubt the sky will fall now.
3809 2018-05-09 17:52:56 If your getting your oil changed please do not drive for fucking hours then expect your car to be done in 20mins. Bitch I ain’t burning my anymore on these cars fuck that.
3810 2018-05-09 17:52:48 You've got it backwards. He said-if Iran RESTARTS the nuclear program. Meaning the Saudis are aware that reviews by the IAEA show Iran IS NOT building nukes. See, everyone implicitly acknowledges Iran was in compliance. But Israel and Arab oil dictatorships view Iran as a threat.
3811 2018-05-09 17:52:47 Well, then one could always use a different type of oil.

Or maybe use a light vinegar-based sauce or something.
3812 2018-05-09 17:52:45 Maybe I'll take advantage of the oil and try and remove the wart from my thumb finally.
3813 2018-05-09 17:52:40 Only one major repair job on the Mazda in 9 years, but the 70$ a month in insurance, 120$ in gas and annual tire/oil changes really added up even though I was barely using it. New headlights here and there really dragged me down.

3819 2018-05-09 17:51:50 how do you do this hot oil treatment? is it as simple as heating before applying or do you let it sit for a time??
3820 2018-05-09 17:51:49 @forduk absolutely disgusted with your company as a whole. Bought a brand new van one year ago. Had a reoccurring issue with the oil filter. Now I'm told I will have to pay for it myself. Seeking legal advice

3823 2018-05-09 17:51:42 Love seeing crude oil prices jump, thank you Trump!  I know I can't wait to pay  $4 gas this summer.
3824 2018-05-09 17:51:41 Seems the US only counts lives when it wants to make war against some tin pot dictator who is, or may be, sitting on a whole lot of oil.

3826 2018-05-09 17:51:38 So chuck dips his Oreos in olive oil.
3827 2018-05-09 17:51:29 Yes. And they agree they’re going to “get the oil” this time.
3828 2018-05-09 17:51:13 #potstocks and #oil and #cryptocurrency is all you need at the this moment in time. hhaha
3829 2018-05-09 17:51:11 I think I like olive oil even less than tomatoes
3830 2018-05-09 17:51:01 HTF are oil stocks rising?
3831 2018-05-09 17:50:53 especially in beauty, "luxury" brands go sooooo wild  (remember that $30 extra virgin coconut oil i posted a while back???) the CEO of The Ordinary could do *literally anything* on his instagram feed-- i don't fucking care-- i am coming back for the $6 HA and u can't stop me
3832 2018-05-09 17:50:46 I’m sure it will happen. Meanwhile, keep a hefty supply of midnight oil.
3833 2018-05-09 17:50:34 Any government from 1947 have never tried 2 lower the price of fuel , because of commissions given 2 ruling parties by oil exporting country,world R moving towards electric cars we R still stuck with liquid fuel, day electric car starts in India govt double the tax on battery
3834 2018-05-09 17:50:33 What’s wrong with City fans..... why are they trying to invent a rivalry with us.  You have oil money and Pep, when they go, you crumble. We have history , tradition and the best fans in the world, oh and a cheap team bus going if your interested.YNWA
3835 2018-05-09 17:50:32 This week’s domestic crude oil production estimate incorporates a re-benchmarking that raised estimated volumes by 70,000 barrels per day, which is just less than 0.7% of this week’s estimated production total.

3836 2018-05-09 17:50:29 The whole situation is US 50/50 oil concession that overthrow Mossadegh in 1953. Then after 25 years shah wanted full control of oil and he ended up overthrown. The replacement of uneducated mullahs was something US did a miscalculation. And here we r with this mess in ME.
3837 2018-05-09 17:50:27 My favorite pizza eschews the typical tomato/marina sauce for a light olive oil (and garlic) drizzle.

3839 2018-05-09 17:50:19 Go back and read my old tweets. I told you Trump would drive oil prices up. This will in turn drive up the cost of living. BTW, I also told you #MAGA was total bullshit. #RESISTANCE
3840 2018-05-09 17:50:17 i love eating in Italy because you can just top any dish with a clump of ricotta and olive oil
3841 2018-05-09 17:50:17 I just spent $15 on tea tree oil (fuck knows why it's so expensive. Are we short on trees?) to remove something from my eyeball. Watch this doesn't even work.
3842 2018-05-09 17:50:13 Baby oil and pixi glow tonic were the winning remover combo 
3843 2018-05-09 17:50:09 A bit perplexed that Sasol has not done better today. With brent oil at $77 after Trump quits Iran nuclear deal and the ZAR a bit weaker - surprised it has closed unchanged. Similarly would have expected more of an impact on MTN than 0.6% down.
3844 2018-05-09 17:49:48 Dealing with that regime was a mess. A mess started by the Brits in the late 50's over oil.
3845 2018-05-09 17:49:46 Oil kaya gitu exo nya 8 bulan setelah dibukaa. Bisa buat macem2 ko. Kemarin tanya admin kleveru buat campuran moist bisa, rambut, campur fw juga bisa katanya. Kalo aku sih buat campuran masker sih
3846 2018-05-09 17:49:43 Maybe Putin told Trump to pull out of Iran deal and impose  sactions to prop up oil prices or Trump pulled Iran deal to benefit  US oil producers. How do you find out? Watch how much money donate to Trump camp 2020 from oil industry!
3847 2018-05-09 17:49:43 this move was done in 4 days (really 2 days as the other 2 were flat). Volume was dismal until it broke 2680. SPY & DIA still below level of 1 month ago. NAS is above. Q2 gdp lowered already. Oil up 3% & 10 yt at 3. This makes little sense unless you believe in big time growth.
3848 2018-05-09 17:49:30 From what I hear is that only the United States is dropped out and only US companies will be hurt. So the deal is still in effect with other countries, nothing has changed, no freezing of their bank account and getting top dollars on oil right now. Black Cube found nothing.
3849 2018-05-09 17:49:26 Idk why my face get too oily.. Even i wash it with oil controlling face wash.. Whyyyyyy! Any suggestions!

3853 2018-05-09 17:49:14 This issue will never ever be resolved now because Chinese won't vacate part of POK gifted by Pakistanis to them. As per UN Pak has to also vacate POK but OBOR passes through POK & China needs it for their oil security using Gwadar port. Lyazah yeh rozeh chaloo kissah.
3854 2018-05-09 17:49:04 Kashmir is burning, oil prices are sky high, too much haters spreading, country becoming communal,  safety of women is under question, rich is continuing to get richer and poor are used for vote gains, is it all about power and criticism of the opposition?

3870 2018-05-09 17:47:13 How does barrels of oil produced in US equate to US consumption of petroleum products? It's confusing b/c refined products doesn't seem to equal production. Can the US be import free soon?
3871 2018-05-09 17:47:08 I sold all of my $LUV and $RCL in the past couple of days due to $RCL having no true "bottom" and $LUV due to the downgrades and oil prices since airlines do not hedge their prices much anymore

3873 2018-05-09 17:46:30 The coming Iran war is all about oil discoveries in the Golan Heights and has nothing to do with nuclear arms.
3874 2018-05-09 17:46:29 Pesto time! This is the recipe:
150ml olive oil
1 bunch spring onions, finely sliced
4 garlic cloves, crushed
200g wild garlic leaves (with any thick, tough stalks already stripped off)
20g fresh chives, snipped
100g pine nuts
100g finely grated vegan parmesan
1 tsp caster sugar
3875 2018-05-09 17:46:23 So oil works at Tim Hortons, got it
3876 2018-05-09 17:46:21 Such bullshit that a baguette dipped in olive oil makes you fat.
3877 2018-05-09 17:46:17 Putin makes big oil $$ with Iran sanctioned.
3878 2018-05-09 17:46:14 Vegan peeps just a heads up incase you eat at @TheChiquito I was disgusted to find out yesterday from staff that everything is fried in the same oil as they fry meat in.  Horrendous. Obviously don't take people with dietary requirements into consideration. #vegan #GoVegan #vegans
3879 2018-05-09 17:46:01 Also continues to look wedgy on oil but still no real reversal
3880 2018-05-09 17:45:56 @WashburnThom Trump wants sanctions you include our allies stop buying  oil: Likely, this will drive up gasoline price. Trump never thinks things through.

3882 2018-05-09 17:45:29 URGENT: Trump and Interior Secretary Zinke are rushing to open the Arctic Refuge to oil and gas drilling. Act now and stand up against any move to open the Arctic Refuge to Big Polluters!
3883 2018-05-09 17:45:27 WJFW - Local retailer misunderstands CBD oil regulations
3884 2018-05-09 17:45:22 Exactly! If you're going to run it back because the organization likes making money off a good, but not great, team, then be honest about that. Otherwise, after a while, it starts to sound like you're selling snake oil.
3885 2018-05-09 17:45:22 With Trump it’s always about money. 

Money for Russian oil at higher prices due to sanctions against Iranian oil.
3886 2018-05-09 17:45:16 Greenwald seems only capable of posting ironically. I'm sure Russia really, truly, pinky-swears that it opposes all those choices Trump makes that distances us from (and breaks promises to) it's allies....yep. And the inevitable oil $$ surge.  They can't even.

3930 2018-05-09 17:42:29 @EliseStefanik is part of the swamp culture, a @SpeakerRyan "yes-man" and Trump apologist. We just destabilized the region by withdrawing, gave Iran permission to start work on nuclear weapons and increased Soviet coffers with higher oil prices.

3933 2018-05-09 17:42:21 The history of the U.S. (CIA) involvement throughout the entire Middle East, particularly in Iran, is one of exploitation for cheap oil. The American electorate should have celebrated the 1979 Revolution. Instead they were brainwashed by our corrupt leaders.

3947 2018-05-09 17:41:24 I believe a similar protest happened in Seattle area, either this year or last year, regarding a pipeline or some form of expansion of oil in their region.
3948 2018-05-09 17:41:23 Why political?  In a period of increasing demand growth with shrinking storage, and years of greatly reduced exploration Capex, unrealistic to believe oil prices could stay low. It is the boom and bust typical of commodity cycles.

3954 2018-05-09 17:40:56 So, Let me get this straight...Trump bombed Russia's proxy Syria. Trump heavily sanctioned Russian Oligarchs. Trump selling US LNG to Europe is killing Russia's economy. Trump has the US overtaking Russia as the worlds largest oil producer. Yet Putin & Russian Oligarchs own Trump
3955 2018-05-09 17:40:53 Can you imagine having an American president that would betray an international treaty and reimpose sanctions on Iran in order to lift oil prices to pay off his Russian blackmailers?

3958 2018-05-09 17:40:35 It does not work like that given secondary impact of US sanctions. Also US oil blockade looks to strangle the country economically. You seem to assume this administration is interested in negotiation with Iran. That's a big leap of faith

3962 2018-05-09 17:40:24 No, keystone isn’t nearly enough capacity. Also, the US is a net exporter of Oil. We need to get our oil and gas overseas.

3976 2018-05-09 17:38:59 Yes, the back room deals were making many rich. There is a reason that the Iranians dumped the dollar and started to settle oil in Euros after the dealt talks begun. In April, Iran further dumped the dollar making the Euro their official reporting currency. € = Globalists.
3977 2018-05-09 17:38:51 If you followed trends in floating storage, country storage, world supply/demand, lack of ww investment in energy, you would have seen shorting oil at $64 was a bad call. The mantra of "lower for longer" by the major banks has been just wrong.

4004 2018-05-09 17:36:47 LOL Don't you ever read the credits?
4005 2018-05-09 17:36:47 Oil price drops destroyed the Venezuelan ecomonmy. Only people who have no arguments against socialism use statements like that.
4006 2018-05-09 17:36:45 Oil tank Club...Pep should thank the Open Cheque book he had at his fingers.
4007 2018-05-09 17:36:36 We can only hope these ignorant protesters get hurt.  There is no opposition from the majority of western Canadians.  You clowns are stopping billions of dollars. Go stop tankers from importing oil in eastern canada ?
4008 2018-05-09 17:36:28 They did not want out of the deal!  That's the Koch brothers and Russia  wanting the oil and money! Iran hates the Kochs!
4009 2018-05-09 17:36:22 If you are long #oil good for you! (but) I can tell you that assurances have been made to China that oil will not be scarce due to any #Iran loss. No other players matter and the president will limit gas prices. Trade as you may. Good luck all!
4010 2018-05-09 17:36:22 You can get your oil out through Keystone XL to Houston or by trains and trucks. Oh cant get world price or enough out? Boo hoo. Not my problem. We need to gradually wind down oil patch, not expand it.
4011 2018-05-09 17:36:20 Nahh but oil prices might be fucked,
4012 2018-05-09 17:36:20 Here’s what Trump has accomplished; 1-he reversed normal diplomatic relations with Cuba 2-he reversed the ban on selling surplus military equipment to local police 3-he took us out of Paris Climate Treaty 4-overturned the ban on oil drilling in certain oceans
4013 2018-05-09 17:36:03 It’s all fun and games looking at cars,  but when my car takes 2 hours for an oil change it’s a bit frustrating
4014 2018-05-09 17:36:01 Just watched STV news and the most upbeat story was a gas leak on an oil rig.
4015 2018-05-09 17:36:00 And the utter waste of the North Sea oil bounty...

Where *is* the UK's version of Norway's Sovereign Wealth Fund?
4016 2018-05-09 17:35:51 The Saudis are certainly violent to those who disagree. ISIS say they are moslem and they tell the truth. You know about the apostasy laws. The most dangerous law in sharia. This is rife in India ,Pakistan,Nigeria.All islamic countries are violent and poor apart from the oil rich
4017 2018-05-09 17:35:47 To avoid air pollution, timely response obviously is key, especially for diesel and gasoline spills. But we don’t have the same tight window for heavier oil cleanup as do dispersants and burning, which anyway simply transfer pollution rather than remediating it.

4020 2018-05-09 17:35:36 The GOP at all levels of government from local to state to federal, are enthusiastically cutting education funding so that no one will be able to calculate the impact of the increase of the cost of oil on our weekly/monthly/yearly budget.
4021 2018-05-09 17:35:29 And maybe with the by-product of helping a few US and Russian oil billionaires.
4022 2018-05-09 17:35:19 It's because of the added flavour of extra vitamins of dead bacteria, salty paseena, carbon smoked barbecue from silencers and diesel yummy oil
4023 2018-05-09 17:35:14 Up ~1% since 11am.

4029 2018-05-09 17:34:36 Why? We have plenty of oil. Oil is the only cheap, reliable and plentiful source to power our cars and trucks.

4032 2018-05-09 17:34:33 US wants lower oil prices but oil prices are increasing. Higher oil prices are good for China and Iran, Russia. So what can US do for diminishing it? Just strenghten US dollar.That's the superpower's real power.
4033 2018-05-09 17:34:24 My mate that had a shop used to use a long piece of cotton and a hoover to initially thread internal cables. Superglue end of cotton to new cable.
Also clean new cable with a light oil to remove traces of lanolin used in manufacturing. Gives smoother shifting
4034 2018-05-09 17:34:12 What would happen to an African who happens to pollute the Chinese water, just the way they did here? Woe to the African leaders dining with these snake oil salesmen.

4037 2018-05-09 17:33:54 What about the (incorrect) CNN headline that  dropped oil $2 yesterday? What is that considered?
4038 2018-05-09 17:33:52 That idea must an admin nightmare I’m sure. To put your idea in perspective uk gdp (all approx) pharma 43 billion,car 77.5,it services and software 52 oil and gas 35. That’s some call your making.
4039 2018-05-09 17:33:51 They peddle electoral snake oil.
4040 2018-05-09 17:33:44 I swear it’s in my country more than any middle eastern country. Oil companies foreign workers live in a separate communities, and everything forbidden here is allowed there. And we’re not allowed to enter there, only who works there is allowed.

4043 2018-05-09 17:32:55 Its about time Europe targets swing-states in the US with economic sanctions. BTW, failure of this deal will likely drive the oil price up, which would strengthen Russia. Not complaining, though - Europe needs at least some strong partner after all.
4044 2018-05-09 17:32:54 Algo's don't drive, heat their houses, don't eat food, don't pay mortgages or rent, so I guess higher oil and higher interest rates are bullish if you're an algo.
4045 2018-05-09 17:32:47 This oil tanker ban makes no sense since you have other countries going up and down the BC coast going to other countries.  Talk about destroying your own economy.

4049 2018-05-09 17:32:26 In the past, 1 of the ways I hedged exposure to retail gasoline prices was to go long some ETF or mutual fund that had a relatively high correlation to the oil market. I forgot to do that this time around.

4051 2018-05-09 17:32:25 How is Trump pulling out of the Iran Nuclear deal good for Putin? It may raise the oil price but that benefits America and the Gulf states too, unless you think Israel and Russia are colluding to control Trump ? It was Israel that put pressure on Trump to pull out of the deal.
4052 2018-05-09 17:32:24 @TVietor08 For PSW. What are your thoughts on the impact of Trump's Iran move related to oil prices, up 3% in < 24 hrs. Higher oil prices generally help Russia, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and US producers. They generally hurt US consumers (who are also now less safe in the world).
4053 2018-05-09 17:32:24 I actually bought valvoline oil yesterday.

4056 2018-05-09 17:32:13 #MAGA Just FYI, prices for oil & natural gas are soaring today due to @realDonaldTrump lying about the Iran Agreement & violating the Agreement.

4057 2018-05-09 17:32:08 not an apologist, but recall hearing Peter say he doesnt short, is long commodities (ie gold/oil) and long foreign stocks (select)...   I've never heard Peter say he was shorting anything...  I guess being long commodities + foreign equities is hedging against usd
4058 2018-05-09 17:32:06 URGENT: Trump and Interior Secretary Zinke are rushing to open the Arctic Refuge to oil and gas drilling. Act now and stand up against any move to open the Arctic Refuge to Big Polluters!

They're fooled... Misled... They've bought the snake oil.

They've been conditioned to hate. We have to forgive them and encourage them to let go of the hate, understand that we can also be fooled...And have been.

4076 2018-05-09 17:31:07 In retrospect it did seem a little odd that oil should be down on the day that one of the biggest producers was taken out of the market.

4078 2018-05-09 17:30:50 I wish people wouldn’t talk about things they don’t  understand. Also America is currently taxing people to subsidize banks, oil companies, military contractors. Why is it okay to tax the poor and give the rich ridiculous clothes, jets and estates.

4082 2018-05-09 17:30:39 Oil prices rose more than 3 percent on Wednesday, after climbing  to fresh 3-1/2 year highs, after a bigger-than-expected drawdown in U.S  oil inventories extended gains from the United States' decision to quit a  nuclear deal with Iran.

4089 2018-05-09 17:30:14 I think of it this way: we transitioned from the most valuable industry being energy to information. What would've happened if power plants were built to only burn Exxon or Shell's oil? What if a car could only run on BP's fuel? This is what we have in modern tech.
4090 2018-05-09 17:30:06 I have a couple hundred bu of oil sunflower seed. Even better than thistle for so many reasons. Maybe I know a couple guys with um what’s it called? Oh ya canola.
4091 2018-05-09 17:29:57 @mdj17 War is murder. Wars for oil are heinous. The Viet Nam War was an intervention into a civil war. Poor against wealthy. Students at Kent State were murdered by US for their peaceful protest.
4092 2018-05-09 17:29:51 To me it seems like the video game #Homefront is becoming closer to reality.  The two Koreas are talking now, Trump pulls out of the Iran nuke deal which might spur a nuke race in the Mid East that could send oil prices skyrocketing causing  American financial collapse.

4099 2018-05-09 17:29:13 You literally did not prove anything. Just that we produce more oil than we used to. Neat. Not what he asked you to prove. That we no longer use other's oil which is independence. Projections are based on a trend, but don't produce an absolute end data point.

4103 2018-05-09 17:28:59 #India - #Iran Trade 

1. Iran accounts for ~ 10 % of Indias oil imports- FY18 ( 6% in FY15, FY16) 
2. Iran oil is at a discount to other countries, gives higher credit period
3. Imports frm Iran FY18:~11Bn $ (80% Oil)
4. Exports:2.65Bn $ - a barter to that extent? @ForexLive
4104 2018-05-09 17:28:51 Bit of oil in the tin foil works wonders 
4105 2018-05-09 17:28:46 O hope they go for the oil deposit in that region, it's taking forever that people have lost hope in the fact that the oil deposit exists. Maybe it will make the south respect us and not see us northerners as leaches living off their oil.

4107 2018-05-09 17:28:44 The reason why I turned bullish here is because I make a lot of money on the long side expoiting the oil theme via $MRO. This group move has the power to lift the market. That was all the confirmation I needed!
4108 2018-05-09 17:28:34 Well, not just grid resiliency. Natural gas still produces CO2 (though better than oil or coal, obviously).
4109 2018-05-09 17:28:34 now why did our government give Iran all that money, heck they have all the oil money they need. Vote out anyone who approved it.
4110 2018-05-09 17:28:23 I'm not an alarmist nor can I control world events so just take one day at a time. Right now, $USD is at 93 and #oil is at 71 and the world hasn't ended.
4111 2018-05-09 17:28:21 Crude could go to $100/barrel Brent. Is KQ prepped for this re aviation fuel? Is the nation ready for Strong dollar and strong oil price at the same time... @coldtusker @nderi_j heavy borrowing

4114 2018-05-09 17:28:04 CBD oil is very effective for pain. If you can get it legally, I suggest trying it. It will not show up on an average drug screen unless you use waaay too much, which is pointless.
4115 2018-05-09 17:27:57 Twist: Tarriffs resulting in excess& cheap  corn and soy, plus  Iran sanctions jacking up the price of oil, force the USA to adopt bio-diesel and other alternative energy products.
4116 2018-05-09 17:27:54 Crude oil $71.24 up $2.18 for a barrel you know what that means  peeps higher gases prices so thank POTUS for this since he removed the US from the Iran deal. Enjoy the high gas prices folks.

4131 2018-05-09 17:26:32 Being wiped out by higher gas/oil prices, inflation & cancelled orders from China for our farmers as well as cutbacks by your ugly policies. Way to go Republicans. Your attitude toward poor & those just eking out a living doesn't go unnoticed by citizens.
4132 2018-05-09 17:26:26 Heck, we can also bring in the oil companies and their insurers since they pay climate scientists to tell them how to protect their ocean-based rigs.

4136 2018-05-09 17:26:11 Aaah oil. The achilles heel of every Indian government. Is it likely that RBI would revise their previous forecast? 
And in the meantime, should we start cycling to work?
4137 2018-05-09 17:26:11 Hmm, that's a toughie.

I guess we could go to Venezuela and ask Maduro how their oil industry (that Chávez nationalized) is doing.
4138 2018-05-09 17:25:58 $TSLA still like it here with oil prices going up as an additional bonus.
4139 2018-05-09 17:25:56 You may think you're subtle. Your base and party may be willing to let you do as you please.

But the majority of voters in this country never bought your snake oil to start with. Try restricting the press. See what happens. You won't like it.
4140 2018-05-09 17:25:55 Stanley Fischer is a total douchebag. When he talks BS is verbalized. China has made their point and we have made our response clear. Oil is way overpriced because that will be part of the deal...lol! #CL_F
4141 2018-05-09 17:25:55 I got mozzarella soaked in olive oil, pepper, and basil from Aldi’s today and it’s the best thing to happen to me.
4142 2018-05-09 17:25:54 I truly do believe everything happens for a reason. I got lost in Wilkes Barre after my oil change and I found a Dairy Queen in the process.
4143 2018-05-09 17:25:50 Coming up on @trtworld to discuss oil prices, Iran deal and what’s next!
4144 2018-05-09 17:25:39 Sorry Buzz...i can't be unhappy with rising oil prices...my small island state needs the $$$ from our output right now...$40 oil is no good for us
4145 2018-05-09 17:25:33 Daughter just suggested that you can make your own putty and then put the oil in.
4146 2018-05-09 17:25:28 Data is the new oil.
4147 2018-05-09 17:25:23 market up due oil~down also due to oil
4148 2018-05-09 17:25:19 The USA has a surplus of oil and now sells it to other countries. You won’t need a raise in your allowance for this deal. Do you really think we get our oil from Iran?
4149 2018-05-09 17:25:13 Kanami lang sa pamatyag nga nag tubo na kilay ko ah. Thanks castor oil!! Hahahahahahahahaha
4150 2018-05-09 17:25:06 Seen one ginger you’ve seen them all.
4151 2018-05-09 17:24:46 My 10-year old did the math last night.

Trump’s impact on oil prices will cost me over $1,000 this year. 

Now, if only Trump supporters were as good at math as a 10-year old.
4152 2018-05-09 17:24:43 China prioritises oil purchases for countries that take the gold back Yuan, Angola, and Russia in particular - Russia being its biggest supplier.
4153 2018-05-09 17:24:34 Cheese naks tastes like it layed in oil for too long
4154 2018-05-09 17:24:31 Everbody wants a piece of the action and now Iran is open for taking. Some to Russia, some to Turkey, Israel gets some relief from terror financing, and big business gets developed oil fields to exploit.
4155 2018-05-09 17:24:28 No Doubt. My moms was like, I have news for you kid, I double up everything! Lol. The mix has Chocolate chips and everything, just add eggs and oil. Hers are always so dense and thick... I was adding Flour to double up, which only lessened the flavour.
4156 2018-05-09 17:24:26 Stock market rising because they are buying oil stocks (Hoping the price skyrockets) and defense stocks (hoping we will go to war.)
4157 2018-05-09 17:24:17 Oil companies will post 2018 record profits. Unscrupulous companies will raise prices for faux reasons. Artificial commodity market will run up oil prices for greed profits.
USA doesn’t use Iranian oil.
In the end, Iran should stop supporting terrorists, then we wouldn’t be here.
4158 2018-05-09 17:24:15 Yup. Me too
4159 2018-05-09 17:24:12 PTI from yesterday. Re Iran deal. Now allow the Saudis and the US to sell more oil. Taking the economic fear from our EU brethren. Reward N Korea for D- nuking. Encourage the Iranian people to remember the Shah and what a great people they are
4160 2018-05-09 17:24:11 How do you mean that? Who controls the oil?
4161 2018-05-09 17:24:08 Oil is a beast...but some day soon it will prolly tank hard...
4162 2018-05-09 17:24:07 The Economic policy may have been built on oil and it was flawed but thats not all independence is about. Open your eyes.
4163 2018-05-09 17:24:05 Change your oil
4164 2018-05-09 17:24:01 we wouldn't be surprised if he did 
4165 2018-05-09 17:23:55 of the transaction. Once corrupt always corrupt. This is right out of Putin’s book. How do you think he got so rich and powerful? Why dod Trump hand over our parks for oil exploitation or pipelines? Want to bet he got a ginormous cut for it? Sigh... #NaiveAmerica
4166 2018-05-09 17:23:55 I love how you can take your car in for a routine oil change and they magically find a million things wrong with your car that must be fixed immediately. It never fails
4167 2018-05-09 17:23:49 ทุกสิ่งล้วนไม่แน่นอน อย่าไปยึดติด 
4168 2018-05-09 17:23:39 US will have no need to partition RF if RF cooperates and acknowledges US power, and gives special rights to US multicorporations to rob RF of its oil and gas and minerals..its that simple..
4169 2018-05-09 17:23:38 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
4170 2018-05-09 17:23:35 @STVNews the most upbeat story on STV News tonight was a gas leak on an oil rig.
4171 2018-05-09 17:23:25 I mean have you ever heard of the loc method? ( leave in, oil, and a curl cream. ) do that and brush alot
4172 2018-05-09 17:23:16 Anyone asking who is really going to profit from higher oil prices? Russia needs that money and their costs are too high to sell their oil at lower prices. Iran will now drive up the oil prices higher. While fracking will greatly increase here!
4173 2018-05-09 17:23:09 Russian oil is sanctioned though
4174 2018-05-09 17:22:49 Very skeptical 5%. More like 1%. Point is impossible to run modern society without coal, oil, natural gas for long long time unless unforeseen breakthrough. Wind very inefficient 18th century technology. Energy sparse and very bad for environment. Solar more promising.
4175 2018-05-09 17:22:48 finally got an oil diffuser and I’m feeling like a classy ass bitch
4176 2018-05-09 17:22:46 No, they are supplements to reliable energy. We are decades and decades away from any real switch. Oil demand is projected to continue growing and growing. Canada should be supplying as much oil as possible.
4177 2018-05-09 17:22:41 Racist
4178 2018-05-09 17:22:34 Fuck!!
I poured the Yorkshire pudding mix into the hot oil ... .... Then realised I had forgotten the eggs. 
4179 2018-05-09 17:22:31 Coconut oil is the GOAT!
4180 2018-05-09 17:22:26 Left wing haters. 76.93 Brent Oil.
4181 2018-05-09 17:22:22 Iran - severed from $

4183 2018-05-09 17:22:19 And to try to raise oil and gas prices to benefit Russia.
4184 2018-05-09 17:22:19 It almost appears as if those who control the oil, control our very thinking through propaganda
4185 2018-05-09 17:22:12 @OrganicHealth10: RT @mercola: No long-term human-safety studies have been conducted on #canola oil. So why does the food industry say it...
4186 2018-05-09 17:22:11 @lisamurkowski 

Really?!?! You want to put the squeeze on your people with #NetNeutrality too?!?! What? Bc the high gas/oil prices aren't up enough?! What is your deal?
4187 2018-05-09 17:22:04 10-15% typically has been, but that’s when our methods/technology have not been used
We have the ability to eliminate the remaining 85-90% of oil that typically is left behind, at the molecular level.

4188 2018-05-09 17:21:54 Oh yes it sure does!!! Use it before your facial oil or Moisturiser morning or night! 
#Womaninbiz #wnukrt
4189 2018-05-09 17:21:53 Then why are they mad

It was Obama that gave  billions to an oil rich country for a bailout/deal

So why are they mad
4190 2018-05-09 17:21:52 I’ve heard about em.. I just need some air in a tire so hopefully they won’t piss me off  RT @LuvelyLady22: @Consistent__D They take hours for just a simple oil change 
4191 2018-05-09 17:21:51 With the  destabilization of middle eastern oil maybe Russia & the trump team is king
4192 2018-05-09 17:21:44 Iran deal good or bad for MTN? Some cash ‘trapped’ but oil on the charge - Nigeria/Guana etc. I think good... Go Long Now?! 61 followers, please respond!

4195 2018-05-09 17:21:34 SA won't let oil go much beyond 85 a bbl.
4196 2018-05-09 17:21:22 You backed out of the Iran deal so here go gas and oil prices, so tell the ppl out here how they will heat their homes and get to work, because they will have to choose between feeding their families or car and keeping warm.  The economy is going to suffer with the sanctions, US
4197 2018-05-09 17:21:20 Oil and a lot of brushing
4198 2018-05-09 17:21:16 Eating too much oil can course that.
4199 2018-05-09 17:21:14 America needs to wake up. Everything he has done is for this. Including the ACA... (look into insurance co’s) the EPA (look into pesticide and oil co’s) pretty sure he has gotten something for his personal benefit from all them. He now has them unde his thumb bc he has the info
4200 2018-05-09 17:21:03 Shouldnt there have been a petition or smth.we should do like the canadians that oil line aint happening
4201 2018-05-09 17:20:57 Hmmmm. I would like to express my opinion over this third rate ambulance chaser and qualified snake oil salesman. Let me think...hold my beer.
4202 2018-05-09 17:20:50 Almond or soy instead of regular milk, vegan (oil based) butter, and applesauce instead of eggs to stick it all together...
4203 2018-05-09 17:20:48 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of The LORD for ever.
I Praise The LORD CHRIST
4204 2018-05-09 17:20:25 Regardless of oily skin, ALWAYS moisturize! Your skin may be over producing oil to make up for the lack of moisture you’re giving it  Oh and drink ALL of the water.
4205 2018-05-09 17:20:16 @BootstrapCook Healthy is believe it or not when the body feels better after eating than before eating. I dont mean just a full belly. I mean the brain is happier and body feels energized. Today I had some yautia with olive oil and salt and for me it works, brain/body are energiz
4206 2018-05-09 17:20:14 Guy is like a snake oil salesmen they can’t just go away
4207 2018-05-09 17:20:04 Russia has both pluses & minuses to us pulling out. +s: more oil $ for Putin, further fracture of NATO allies, decreased US standing in the world. -s: increased instability in Mideast could get Russians killed in wars with their allies in region.
4208 2018-05-09 17:20:00 A month ago, Bahrain announced it has discovered at least 80 billion barrels of oil and deep gas reserves in the region of 10-20 trillion cubic feet.
4209 2018-05-09 17:19:57 I'd put them in a fucking oil drum and weld them in before dropping the drums in the middle of the Atlantic. Horrifying.
4210 2018-05-09 17:19:38 Oil prices
4211 2018-05-09 17:19:37 @VictorAfrica a caller on @Powerfm987 asked why RSA is not considering a pipeline for oil from Angola, which can be shared with Botswana. This in substitution of oil from Iran & Saudi Arabia. Has this been on the agenda, if not why not?
4212 2018-05-09 17:19:30 Everytime the price of oil goes up... it helps russian interests. They are HEAVILY leveraged in the oil market.

Wonder why this administration would DO such a thing. It boggles.
4213 2018-05-09 17:19:29 where to buy beard oil?
4214 2018-05-09 17:19:27 Yum. Sounds healthy too.
Had a ciabatta today I thought had been made with olive oil. Wrong. It was made with olives. Eeeeeewwww! Like sliced up slugs. The ducks had them.
I
4215 2018-05-09 17:19:26 I think that eventually we'll find fraud in the avo oil biz just like the olive oil biz. Avocadoes were always expensive and frequently go through periods of low supply, this boom of new products can't possibly be sustainable with pure avo oil
4216 2018-05-09 17:19:15 Every man should own some coconut oil.
4217 2018-05-09 17:19:12 Totally love this statement, thumbs up Anders.
4218 2018-05-09 17:19:10 Any paycheck gains will now be erased by higher oil/gas prices. Retirement accounts losing money because stock market down over 2k pts. Thousands no longer counted in unemployment. Economy doing well now but it can all go to hell in an instant. Bad judgement by Pres doesn't help.
4219 2018-05-09 17:19:04 Also the whole world knows you and campaign delightfully conspired with Putin's intell to sabotage Hillary to win election  - very important to Russian economy which depend on lifted sanctions and oil sales
4220 2018-05-09 17:19:01 引火したら、もう手遅れさ…
4221 2018-05-09 17:18:49 So I finally bought the Herbivore Lapis oil and Blue Tansy face mask and both are REALLY GOOD for acne control/acne scars and I didn’t get irritated or any adverse reactions even tho I have super sensitive skin!!! I’ve only been using it for a week but my skin looks super good

4224 2018-05-09 17:18:25 Just what he wanted all along, a reason to go to war then claim the oil as spoils of war.
4225 2018-05-09 17:18:25 Started the day with a major oil spillage (a whole bottle) in the boot of my car - over all my work stuff and everything, gahhh.
4226 2018-05-09 17:18:16 Fed's Bostic: Fallout from higher oil prices unclear so far
4227 2018-05-09 17:18:14 How about making some plant based receipes without any oil?
4228 2018-05-09 17:17:52 What terminal value do you use? Ie the assets stop producing in year X. What fade rate do you use? Ie how fast does production fall off existing base And finally if I may be so bold using a cost of equity for a micro cap oil stock of 2.5% is bonkers.
4229 2018-05-09 17:17:48 "Nearly in place" = if the US were to cut a major oil exporting nation out of the USD system, that volume could move to China/CNY/Chinese banks/CIPS & settle.  Then spread to other commodities (Int'l iron ore contract just launched in China.)
4230 2018-05-09 17:17:44 Wow we have the same hair! I use sheamoisture usually and it ain’t even 40 dollars. they have a whole range. I use the kinds for damaged hair but u could prob do any! their white bottles, which I think are coconut oil based, are a good start
4231 2018-05-09 17:17:28 Well, I suppose oil prices are on a roll. This was my fear regarding the LTIP - a recovery in oil prices might be all it would take to transfer a load of wealth to management.
4232 2018-05-09 17:17:26 I would think so. Olive oil and vegetables to the fore
4233 2018-05-09 17:17:19 The worst thing in fossil energy I've seen is Tallinn's single oil power plant. Don't got pictures with me, but the trains of tankers constantly fed to it are insane.
4234 2018-05-09 17:17:18 I can literally hear the Flintsone’s foot paddling sound effect while reading this.
4235 2018-05-09 17:17:17 Data is the new oil. It’s worthless until you process it. What you do with data is key.
4236 2018-05-09 17:17:17 Crude oil prices hit a 3.5 year high today.
4237 2018-05-09 17:17:11 My folks are visiting this weekend to watch my thesis defense and for maybe the first time ever my car isn’t overdue for an oil check #realadult
4238 2018-05-09 17:17:07 Same! A relative hipped me to the connection. That said, Mormon business savvy (aka pyramid marketing) is somethin' else. *applies Mormon-distributed essential oil to wrist*
4239 2018-05-09 17:17:05 Yeah that's why, all those decades ago, our CIA helped Britain depose your democratically-elected government and installed the US-controlled Shah. All for the purpose of stealing oil profits.
4240 2018-05-09 17:16:58 Ahhh, trying to get the last word in, Sorry rubber man. Oh, no comment on shorting oil at $64? Talk about a brutal call!!!!!!

4249 2018-05-09 17:16:07 Went to get my oil changed at 10am... left there at 12:43PM...
4250 2018-05-09 17:16:03 ctrl+f "independence:  "Sieminski’s comments suggest energy independence in the form of net exports - in other words, while importation still occurs, there’s overall more oil and gas going out than coming in." So, not independence.
4251 2018-05-09 17:16:02 Oil rising. 10-year Treasury yield topped 3% earlier. But Wall Street does a Taylor Swift and shakes it off. Nice market rally today. Dow up nearly 170.
4252 2018-05-09 17:15:56 And oil prices spike up. I gotta wonder how much money comrade @realDonaldTrump made yesterday...
4253 2018-05-09 17:15:36 And Iran 3rd in oil production  - so who does this betrayal benefit  ( end of Iran Deal  ) .Any country doing business w Iran will now be sanctioned ?
4254 2018-05-09 17:15:26 Yeah vast majority were Saudis and US did nothing becuase of oil interest I never said I agreed with that. Iran was also responsible for members of 9/11 as well as harboring terrorist and enabling them 9/11 is small example.
4255 2018-05-09 17:15:20 The NDP took the blame for the 6 billion dollar defiect that was tabled BEFORE they even took power by the Albertan PC party. Harper blamed them for it when Cons put it on the books in 2015.

Are they are responsible for the low oil prices spending the Heritage Fund as well?

4274 2018-05-09 17:14:02 Whatever one thinks of its merits @realDonaldTrump has seemed to want to side with the terrible people running Russia to buffer against the terrible people running China, what better way than running up oil?
4275 2018-05-09 17:13:53 Get your head out of the Fox News/Brietbart propaganda and look around. Russians paid your fat orange turnip money. Russians hacked our election. Russians are the group he consistently helps out. you think the Iran deal is about Iran? It's about raising oil prices to HELP RUSSIA.
4276 2018-05-09 17:13:46 Maybe she used coconut oil or shea butter that removes stretch marks. Or maybe she was blessed not to have em. Idk.
4277 2018-05-09 17:13:43 All three of those left governments are on the record as wanting to phase out fossil fuels sooner rather than later. So no, ideologically, NDP and Green want Alberta Oil dead. Period. And Liberals want more votes in BC.
4278 2018-05-09 17:13:40 Don't you guys look below the surface? I know you do Meghan. Israel and Saudi Arabia and Russia are allies and they want Syria. Probably for the oil. 
It's not about "funding terror". It's about money and I know you all know that! So why act so ignorant?
4279 2018-05-09 17:13:39 Can our amazing President do something about the out of control price of gasoline?  It is a huge tax on the people.  Please help.  Tell those oil people to stoip the raping.

4282 2018-05-09 17:13:22 Bear in mind he comes from oil money from a company that had the influence, investment, and legislative backing of the Gore family and friendly relations with the USSR.
So, back off! Untouchable.
4283 2018-05-09 17:13:21 It smells like car oil in my car. Why 
4284 2018-05-09 17:13:19 I’m sure everyone in the district is so happy that gas has gone up $1 per gallon since Trump became president, and it’s not going drop being in conflict with the 3rd largest oil maker.
4285 2018-05-09 17:13:17 Trump- What're we getting out of this agreement?

Logical person- They aren't making nuclear weapons

T- No money or free oil!

LP- They're required to allow nations to inspect to confirm adherence

T- There's no upside! Tear it up!

4289 2018-05-09 17:13:02 You are fake news. IT is not the factor at all. Those companies have made their money long ago, and well ahead of time by how they charge. They will use any excuse to raise their prices. Cronyism is their lifestyle in those oil companies.
4290 2018-05-09 17:12:54 Hillary is a warmonger Trump wants to get out of foreign wars, unless we are taking their oil, or Obama accomplished something with them, or they're mean to Trump. #SteinOrBust
4291 2018-05-09 17:12:48 really gotta change the oil in my car today. been super lazy about it
4292 2018-05-09 17:12:47 lol I’ll tell ya! In the morning, Korres Greek yogurt cleanser, Fresh rose toner, Drunk Elephant day serum, and Drunk Elephant polypeptide cream. At night, same face wash,  same toner, Drunk Elephant night serum and Drunk Elephant marula oil.
4293 2018-05-09 17:12:47 Yeah. They will hike it after the Election results. As in starting of 2019 they will cut the rate . And during election days they will keep emphasis on only one issue that Look , during our tenure we provide oil  at low price and ppl will forget last 4 yrs and will remember fresh
4294 2018-05-09 17:12:43 Don’t know how the international oil market works do you?
4295 2018-05-09 17:12:40 Trump pulling out of the nuke deal is going to cost European businesses a lot.  It’s fucking up the US/EU relationship, it doesn’t help Syria, it pushes oil and some gases prices up - for what?
4296 2018-05-09 17:12:28 夜な夜な夜な
4297 2018-05-09 17:12:28 Nah, they were never getting changed. Why should Mercedes or Ferrari pay Millions to develop these engines only to get them simplified. It won't happen. The oil question needs answered from Petronas as they develop it.
4298 2018-05-09 17:12:24 Advantage of govt owning oil Co's !
4299 2018-05-09 17:12:19 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.

4304 2018-05-09 17:11:53 Oil prices?
4305 2018-05-09 17:11:48 Seems that complaining does get you somewhere ; £5 from Sainsbury’s for substandard click and collect and now a free bottle of MCT oil from amazon for iffy packaging 
4306 2018-05-09 17:11:43 This is what this whole charade is all about. Oil. Saudi was $80 per barrel.
4307 2018-05-09 17:11:36 Trump does NOT care if oil/gas prices go up after breaking Iran Deal. 

He will push for pollutant heavy & unpopular off shore drilling & fracking to profit big oil/donors.

Zinke & Pruitt in on plan with deregulation and resending protecting National Parks.
4308 2018-05-09 17:11:07 Putin is certainly behind this, the price of oil must go up for Russia!!

4313 2018-05-09 17:10:46 I knew I was supposed to do something before I went back home I need my damn oil changed

4315 2018-05-09 17:10:40 After the oil crash, we all lived seven to a hut in bagruppen. Things had changed, but we were resilient.
4316 2018-05-09 17:10:29 Him (somewhat proudly): You left your bra in my front seat yesterday, and it was there when I took the car in for an oil change. They probably think I’m some kind of badass Playboi.

4319 2018-05-09 17:10:15 why do you want extra virgin oil?
4320 2018-05-09 17:10:13 PSA: don’t use peppermint oil and then touch your eyeballs.

 I am  still in shock .
Is he drilling oil?

 
4324 2018-05-09 17:10:01 My car take $25 to fill up...$30 at most

Wtf y’all driving???? Speaking of, I need to go get an oil
4325 2018-05-09 17:09:50 There's Castor Oil for that 
4326 2018-05-09 17:09:50 $SPRN: 0.038 x 0.0385, cheap prices here, Oil stocks will run soon, Oil @$70/barrel & IRAN deals no longer exist...
4327 2018-05-09 17:09:49 Another reason to raise oil prices. It has been proven previously that we have more oil and natural gas than anyone. I ask president Trump to stop this ripoff to working people
4328 2018-05-09 17:09:45 exit crude oil
4329 2018-05-09 17:09:44 He’s spoke about this at several cons actually! From recollection, I’m sure he was going for an accent that couldn’t be placed anywhere specific...but with Misha, it because a running joke that it’s the official accent for oil rigs in the Atlantic (?) ocean 
4330 2018-05-09 17:09:41 Let them eat their oil!
4331 2018-05-09 17:09:40 Getting my first oil change ever without my dad!!!!!!!!!! S/o @CJ_Marciante
4332 2018-05-09 17:09:36 today my car has gotten an oil change, new wipers, PAID OFF (byeee car loan), and i have gotten a haircut, purchased three weeks worth of cat food, and picked up sundry things at target. i am exhausted and adulting is hard.

4334 2018-05-09 17:09:33 We sell! But anyway i think the ingredients lang (if u r gna make it) are flour, salt, and oil. Make a pasty texture and flatten it on a heated, greased pan. Wait until the mixture is crispy enough to be lifted from the pan!
4335 2018-05-09 17:09:31 言いっぱなしは無責任かと思っただけなので（汗）
4336 2018-05-09 17:09:24 Someone told me this morning that Trump passed a bill that CBD oil is now legal in GA.  Is this true?  And if it is, does the bill still have to go through congress before it's final and actually legal?
4337 2018-05-09 17:09:21 14 ไม่ได้แน่ๆ นัดแล้ว 12-13 ทำงาน ก็นกไปจ้า
4338 2018-05-09 17:09:05 But it also could be that higher oil prices will push inflation up. And that is not good for authoritarian countries.

4340 2018-05-09 17:08:43 ‘Death to America,’ burning flags, terrorism....but yeah, oil.
4341 2018-05-09 17:08:41 America first. Oil price shoots up ...we all pay.
4342 2018-05-09 17:08:38 As a Democratic U.S. Congress candidate, I can't say this any simpler. Our government believes peace isn't good for business. Our representatives get their money from military, security, oil & financial biz. They have no guts to stop this & people are killed or become refugees.
4343 2018-05-09 17:08:32 Fucking George Bush driving up the price of Gas for all his GD oil buddies again

4349 2018-05-09 17:08:09 We all must now realise it's not China, Russia or any former leader deposed or killed by US lead instructions but the US itself that seeks world domination. Almost every country on earth has to abide by US trade ideas or suffer the consequences. Not forgetting war for oil!!!
4350 2018-05-09 17:08:07 I put olive oil on my kale, it's easier to scrape off of the plate...
4351 2018-05-09 17:08:03 What do you mean? The media is covering the spike in oil and gasoline prices and the killing of the 30 billion in plane orders to Boeing you have caused.  All the great things you are doing are being reported.
4352 2018-05-09 17:08:01 Took my car to Kia for an oil change last week and saw one of my clients new business on the Beaverton Bakery big screen!! Congrats to the Thorton Family for their step of faith to create their own brand. #LoveCoffee #ThorntonFamilyRoastersCoffee
4353 2018-05-09 17:07:50 I always drive like a brand new bitch after an oil change 
4354 2018-05-09 17:07:45 Good point. Trump gets his discord with the media from Putin.  He gets his strategic plans related to Iran from Netanyahu.  He takes his lead on the prostitution of America's land from oil companies, gun control from then NRA and so on and so on and so on...
4355 2018-05-09 17:07:40 Something to do with oil 
4356 2018-05-09 17:07:39 Please don't do that.  It is snake oil and you're now selling it.
4357 2018-05-09 17:07:27 Mom’s Free Oil Change at Big D today!  Grateful for the hard work that these gentlemen are providing and grateful for the lives we are blessings with this outreach. Happy Mother’s Day

4362 2018-05-09 17:06:56 Well, the returns on all those oil shares they own will make up for it, right?  For Trump, it was a win/win: undo another Obama legacy while further enriching himself and the top one percent.
4363 2018-05-09 17:06:50 Agreed, in this oil loving country, Solar seems to be very inefficient. I wonder why that is?
4364 2018-05-09 17:06:49 @nytimes Hey Reporters !  I would like to know and please research, how much stock in oil companies does everyone in the Trump family own?? other downstream investments.  Is the Iran deal canceled benefit greatly the Trumps ??? Great story. Thx
4365 2018-05-09 17:06:43 I just can’t listen to this shit anymore
4366 2018-05-09 17:06:42 Yes but we should have started 40 years ago.  I think we may have 10 years before burning oil becomes unacceptable.
4367 2018-05-09 17:06:23 In order for the war against Iran to work, Russia has to stab Iran in the back. Putin desperately needs $100/barrel oil and wouldn't mind the power vacuum caused by Iran's withdrawal from Syria, Iran and the Caucasus were the U.S. to start a war.
4368 2018-05-09 17:06:22 Cause, Black People; he’s still good with Seward’s purchase of Alaska, cause, Oil.
4369 2018-05-09 17:06:21 That would be to luxurious, that economy must be booming with all the palm oil their exporting
4370 2018-05-09 17:06:16 hopefully they have the right amount of vegetable oil  @k_amyshell
4371 2018-05-09 17:06:10 This is actually my close friends IG ( @ArtistikMind 's painting) but he used oil
4372 2018-05-09 17:05:51 Doesn’t the overproduction of oil or sweat= moisture? I’m confused 
4373 2018-05-09 17:05:36 There aren’t many consumers in those oil producing countries but it’s a nice theory
4374 2018-05-09 17:05:33 As far as i know, CNY denominated oil futures are cash settled and do t take physical delivery.. so your point is moot
4375 2018-05-09 17:05:32 The oil in the back is pilling up
4376 2018-05-09 17:05:25 The obsession is only with pure demonization. No interest in history, culture, daily struggles of average citizens. For all the obsession they don’t care about Iran or Iranis. They care about Jesus, oil, Israeli sovereignty (with no price too high, incl. end of civilization).
4377 2018-05-09 17:05:22 Looks like the powers that be have decided that Iran should be their next victim of war.. Oil must be flowing nicely over there.  @realDonaldTrump
4378 2018-05-09 17:05:09 I feel like mango butter and almond oil will be a good summer switch from Shea butter and castor oil but I gotta find some mango butter
4379 2018-05-09 17:05:04 not going to get any of that oil now.
4380 2018-05-09 17:05:00 & raises the price of oil, which fuels the Russian economy.
4381 2018-05-09 17:04:56 Watch $FTK oil play over 4+ can run fast
4382 2018-05-09 17:04:45 I hate strategically planning on when you have to tell your dad you’ve spent all your money and then having to ask for more but in a way that sounds like you haven’t spent all the money he already gave you... bc gas and oil changes are v expensive:)
4383 2018-05-09 17:04:42 I need to know we have catnip and CBD oil for nervous cockatiels.
4384 2018-05-09 17:04:39 Dont fite me anymore. I just realized its chain lube not oil HAHAH
4385 2018-05-09 17:04:36 Long oil 71.10
4386 2018-05-09 17:04:24 One of the reason he wanted no deal. Helps all of his big oil donors, including Russia. Supply shrinks.
4387 2018-05-09 17:04:22 Very true. Increased reliance on oil exports is already a reality. And sound trade relationships are key for that, LNG, petrochemicals, and refined products
4388 2018-05-09 17:04:18 #AskRhi Hi Rhiannon just a quick question for you about chicken. When roasting for the week for lunches. Mostly in wholemeal bagels thanks to your advice. Is it better to use coconut oil or olive oil?
4389 2018-05-09 17:04:18 Glad my car literally tells me it's time for a oil change lol cuz my slow ass definitely ain't been paying attention 
4390 2018-05-09 17:04:12 I am in private practice now but I've "been in" universities for many years.  It is "real" work hard work.  Publish or perish is very real. I suggest real world oil people look up a guy name Dr. K.A. Clark, you owe this "intellect" a lot.
4391 2018-05-09 17:04:12 the scene is Smoking Hot . Fantastic moves, Beauty and Oil Bath    @thetanalea @KeiranLee
4392 2018-05-09 17:04:04 Those really dry my skin out. I wanted to switch to that but this black soap works really well for my skin and then I took a tip from @ParisBurned and mixed in black castor oil with my shea butter during the winter and my skin looks soooooo good.
4393 2018-05-09 17:03:50 Brilliant! Now we’re the worst cocaine users in the world. The only baby boxes that are a fire risk. Oil that costs more to extract than sell. How do we do it?
4394 2018-05-09 17:03:33 I've said it before, he's no oil painting.
4395 2018-05-09 17:03:23 OK 
Simple, dry fry the dal in the pressure cooker itself. 
Wash & boil for three whistles 
Saute onions till brown (I used mustard oil, for bong pungency) , then fry
Ginger,  garlic paste, add garam masala [home ground] add tomatoes and fry
4396 2018-05-09 17:03:18 A day without a stressful knot in your chest,yes that’s possible.Put a drop of a stress busting oil like bergamot in your palm,rub hands together,breathe in deeply then exhale,do that 4x. #breathe #exhale #nostress #life #grateful

4398 2018-05-09 17:02:54 Iran weak? Gone? You think sanctions alone are going to do that? China, India, Europe, still want their oil. And Russia is all to happy to sell them a nuke.
4399 2018-05-09 17:02:54 all trump cares about is not being “held hostage” by the iran nuclear deal, and wants to put harsh sanctions on exports of oil. you know what that fucking means??

the gas prices are going to skyrocket. “Make America Great Again” my ass. 

you are NOT working for the people.
4400 2018-05-09 17:02:51 If Trump can't bring down the US economy nobody can by the way oil's going to go up to $100.. I believe China and Russia I just going to wait it out and watch the collapse of the dollar... Remember Iran went off the dollar and on to the euro why isn't anybody mentioning that?
4401 2018-05-09 17:02:50 What are your views ,if iran chooses china instead of India as their preferred trading partner.The same oil deals can be offered to them as well.
4402 2018-05-09 17:02:28 @JavierBlas2 does that mean Saudi Arabia will use it's 1-2mbpd spare capacity to pump more oil? Thx
4403 2018-05-09 17:02:26 England, Germany, France, et al, need oil.

4514 2018-05-09 16:53:53 The U.S. has one if not the largest oil reserve in the world. They've just been depleting other countries resources to make a profit with minimal expenditure of their own. The US moves towarda alternative energy sources, basic econ 101 "Looking fresher than new money !"™

4544 2018-05-09 16:51:24 According to the article, ditching the Iran nuclear deal “heightens risks to global oil and US consumer spending.” And as article reports, many of us are already feeling the pain at the gas pump. Here where I live in CT, prices have reached $3 a gallon.
4545 2018-05-09 16:51:16 Getting an oil change makes me feel so adult and accomplished lol pathetic
4546 2018-05-09 16:51:15 "rise came after the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, told reporters he did not expect a major oil price hikes because other countries would increase output to offset such losses"
4547 2018-05-09 16:51:10 What is your plan if drilling ANWR and there is a major oil leak? Are the mitigation plans made public?

4549 2018-05-09 16:51:03 EIA Report: #US #crude #oil imports averaged over 7.3 million bpd last week, "down by 1,226 thousand barrels per day" (sic) vs the previous week. Last 4 weeks #crude #oil #imports avg about 8.1 mln bpd, -1.0% vs year-ago period.
4550 2018-05-09 16:50:50 Instructed to withdraw from the Iran deal so that oil prices rise to help the Russian economy. 
Russia First ( AGAIN!).
4551 2018-05-09 16:50:50 #bamteddy SA Fans, has someone succeeded in paying for the oil? I'm trying and ZENITH is not listed via EFT. How do we go about it?
4552 2018-05-09 16:50:48 Why is it creatures have to suffer because of the greed of humans . Yet another freakin corrupt country is screwing its environment all for the dirty money of oil multinationals
4553 2018-05-09 16:50:46 "Crude oil prices rose to three-and-a-half-year highs following the news that the Trump administration revoked the nuclear deal with Iran"
4554 2018-05-09 16:50:44 And Russia was against it... to elevate their oil prices.

4556 2018-05-09 16:50:31 You aren’t too bright, are you?  They just said on RT they were thrilled for trump’s actions on Iran (in part because it raises oil prices which helps fund their initiatives).

You are a simple, simple man.
4557 2018-05-09 16:50:27 Wall Street was higher on Wednesday, with energy shares getting a boost from a surge in oil prices after President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of a nuclear deal with Iran.
4558 2018-05-09 16:50:24 Bro you just wanna murder and steal these peoples oil soooo bad. Like have a little couth for Christ sake.
4559 2018-05-09 16:50:14 Why did Trump do that? To please the Saudis who need higher oil revenues to buy more American weapons
4560 2018-05-09 16:50:11 And I need a oil change that’s another blue slip I been being cheap lately 
4561 2018-05-09 16:50:04 2/2 rehab is also a good shout because it's not gonna be full of overly acidic fruits. Daddy-O is also a good one (doesn't colour the hair and smells of Parma violets!) If you want a good hair mask I recommend one of their hot oil treatments too. They're all super gentle
4562 2018-05-09 16:49:53 My usual mechanic is booked solid and I needed an oil change. I went to one of them Express Oil Change places.. splent like $20 more than usual.

4564 2018-05-09 16:49:41 Oil prices soar after Trump dumps Iran nuclear deal ----------------He's a cunning idiot!  Now our gas prices will be cumbersome for masses and excuses he and his greedy regime to drill and ruin our natural resources to get energy..so unnecessary
4565 2018-05-09 16:49:37 Actually, they are happy about it. I live in an oil state where people in the oil business make a lot of money when it goes up. Therefore, they are applauding this in Louisiana right now.
4566 2018-05-09 16:49:28 Trump yesterday morning to his oil donors: “Get ready to make some money, boys!”

4590 2018-05-09 16:47:48 Yeah, the American people really thank you mr. president. Oil prices are soaring thanks to you scuttling the Iran deal and Chinese tariffs are starting to hurt our industry. Yeah, you really know how to mess things up.
4591 2018-05-09 16:47:47 It’s really a threefold win for Saudi: 

1. Fill Iran’s production; 
2. Undermine Iran’s regional ambitions; 
3. Continue to control and boost oil price ahead of aramco float..

I’m sure mbs meeting with the bush’s, Kissinger etc last month was no coincidence.

4592 2018-05-09 16:47:19 It made me soooo mad. That happened one time before I was vegan too. I’m allergic to fish and always used Smart Balance butter. They added fish oil to it out of nowhere. My dad and I were so sick and couldn’t figure out why.
4593 2018-05-09 16:47:11 Nah its because his master, Putin, wanted oil prices to increase and our stature to decrease.

4598 2018-05-09 16:47:00 @lewderhaou Wow. The 10-year US Treasury Bill is at 3.002% yield, the DJIA keeps going up (over 133 points now), AND price of oil is $71.22, up over $2 today. Weird counter-intuitive things happening at the same time.

4606 2018-05-09 16:46:10 Thanks for explaining what this means for India. Will India be allowed to buy oil from Iran even after US sanctions come into effect?

Why, to avoid tax, sell oil, arms, rule us, why?
4615 2018-05-09 16:45:15 We have enough oil. 80% of what we use domestically comes from our fields and refineries. And soon we will be selling more of it. Going there and taking their oil is a myth

4630 2018-05-09 16:44:04 — Trump rallies the value of his Rosneft Oil stock almost 30% in one month.
— Price of oil is at its highest in 3½ years, to $70 per barrel, about the average IQ of a GOP Trump supporter.
4631 2018-05-09 16:44:03 So true. They wanna crush our manufacturing industry (moreso), and continue to off sell our oil for pennies. Canada has become history's largest money laundering Scheme. #CdnPoli #Ponzies
4632 2018-05-09 16:44:01 Exactly.. All about Israel, Saudi and them petrodollars. 

Saudi can say to the US that if they’re not holding up their end of the bargain (security), then they’ll sell oil for yuan and % of aramco to Beijing. 

US is not as dependant on foreign oil but still need petrodollar

4640 2018-05-09 16:43:32 Sir, I don't have that much knowledge of Oil politics,but with my little knowledge I analysed that Iran may be ready to accept even Indian currency for oil supplied to India,
Sir u can throw more light on this possibility as purchasing oil in Indian currency will be helpful?

4645 2018-05-09 16:42:46 They probably had a deal with Iran and Russia to run an oil pipeline from Iran through Syria.
4646 2018-05-09 16:42:21 @realDonaldTrump @AbeShinzo @VP @EmmanuelMacron With an increase of 300 eruo taxes or about US $ 430 per tonne, it will certainly shut down Indonesian palm oil producers and palm oil producers. @IMFNews @WorldBank @IFC_org @COP23 @Google @Twitter @japan @Bank_of_Japan_j @facebook

4648 2018-05-09 16:42:19 The oil companies don’t set the oil price.

4675 2018-05-09 16:40:07 I’ll go see it JUST because Chris Pratt is in it,  haha even though  I havent seen Jurassic Park since I was a kid
4676 2018-05-09 16:40:01 Watercolor and oil paint hahaha
4677 2018-05-09 16:39:59 Why would any sane person enter into an agreement with someone who has already stated they want to kill you. The only agreement we should make with Iran is that they no longer can be a nation and the West will use their oil money to feed the hungry.
4678 2018-05-09 16:39:52 The oil change place playing Kid Rock is the most fitting shit ever
4679 2018-05-09 16:39:43 We gave the islamic terrorists 400mil owed to the Shah's govt, 
Then over a billion in interest/tax dollars.
BUT, Obama removed oil sanctions giving them 1mil barrels per day, at $70 per that's 70mil a day to further fund a terrorist country with an economy the size of Maryland.
4680 2018-05-09 16:39:36 #FuseKEC18 ... what's the mustard in our #KT salad dressing, to help get the most from our oil and vinegar? Thanks for the metaphor @shoffmania !
4681 2018-05-09 16:39:31 ゴトトッ！
4682 2018-05-09 16:39:28 Interest fact. Exxon Mobile stock price is the same price today as it was when Oil was $26.00.
4683 2018-05-09 16:39:27 He did as Putin directed to get oil prices higher.
4684 2018-05-09 16:39:21 Can't believe MSM not reporting that the USA is abrogating a treaty it signed on Iran so that the price of oil will go up, Putin can siphon more money out of Russia and make the USA's signature worthless worldwide and divide then USA from its worldwide, democratic allies.
4685 2018-05-09 16:39:21 $300 for an oil change is disrespectful. The mechanic basically said lemme fuck this bitch’s pockets up right quick lmao
4686 2018-05-09 16:39:20 I think it was like whale oil or something.
4687 2018-05-09 16:39:17 Being excited about a oil change and new battery must be part of adulting 
4688 2018-05-09 16:39:13 Higher oil prices also good for US frackers. US "energy dominance" does amount to forcing other suppliers out of the market. Iran, Venezuela, even Russia are targets here.
4689 2018-05-09 16:39:09 For today's politics that's an old notion, Kurds, Palestinians and even Jews perfectly live that. But boers can't be saved by the global Caucasianess. 

Global whiteness lost Hollywood, now they either prostituting themselves to the sunnis oil or Asian industry
4690 2018-05-09 16:38:56 @TheresaRockFace my coworker and I are listening to you at work building oil & gas instruments. We are the ultimate work ninjas and call every day lol
4691 2018-05-09 16:38:56 Because oil companies deal in physical products whereas tech companies have the ability to connect to those people who don't have a clue about oil companies or other products. That's why tech is so popular.
4692 2018-05-09 16:38:48 @jannarden Fort Mac is home to the Oil Sands, this place has helped us feed our families and gainfully employed us and thousands around the country for years. We also employ the most aboriginal people in the country, don't just spew negatives.

4695 2018-05-09 16:38:35 Ladies, well black women were using too much oil based products in our hair! Water adds moisture not oil! #justthoughtyoushouldknow #lightoil #morewater
4696 2018-05-09 16:38:30 The oil price goes up....Marathon and their subs all jack up the price (even though those oil prices are futures....) all simultaneously just to gouge the consumer.  #Legalcollusion
4697 2018-05-09 16:38:30 This is what the #GOP oil led barons always do. They love their oil stocks.... and can't get enough of scr3wing up the middle east. We are now going for one big bombed out mess. But no aliens or refugees allowed into #USA. #IranDeal
4698 2018-05-09 16:38:11 Didn’t do my hair... just sprayed it with leave in conditioner rubbed some oil in it and that’s it 
4699 2018-05-09 16:38:00 Does this include to ruin Europe increasing oil's price due to your catastrophic foreign policies?

4702 2018-05-09 16:37:34 "We need nuclear reactors today, to prepare for when our oil runs out in three centuries!"
4703 2018-05-09 16:37:24 Maybe we should just invade Iran and take their oil so you could pump $3 gas. Shouldn't you be driving an electric car already? The environment is dying for God's sake.

4705 2018-05-09 16:37:08 @realDonaldTrump @AbeShinzo @EmmanuelMacron The Council of Palm Oil Producing Countries (CPOPC) Steering Committee said the CPO tax amendment shows discriminatory measures against Indonesia's products as the largest producer of palm oil. @WorldBank @IMFNews @COP23 @IFC_org #76425

4707 2018-05-09 16:37:02 You are supporting  a very corrupt state Iran, that is back by Russia and China in the Middle East! Trump is right, the French want this due to Total drilling for oil! The Germans for gas! We need to back are US allies, it will bit Britain on are ass! Money.......
4708 2018-05-09 16:37:01 That's the end of me & coconut oil
4709 2018-05-09 16:36:46 This is NOT pollution from fracking!!

Mixture of ferrihydrites - looking like oil and ferric staining of water. Common in the Forest of Bowland

Various fractivists have seen some and say it is due to nearby fracking 

The last two are drying-up ponds on the Fylde miles from PNR
4710 2018-05-09 16:36:39 Oil industry booming
4711 2018-05-09 16:36:37 still keeping my short USD/CAD
oil keep rising
employment data should be good
wages should accelerate as wages actually declined last April...
4712 2018-05-09 16:36:37 The oil and the eye cream are really good in my opinion
4713 2018-05-09 16:36:33 You mean when oil prices were sky high? I can't imagine that a crash in oil prices and the profitability of every company involved in the industry affected jobs! I mean, who could believe that?
4714 2018-05-09 16:36:26 是非拝読させていただきます！
4715 2018-05-09 16:36:24 Are higher oil prices not a good thing?  That leads to more investment in alternative energy.
4716 2018-05-09 16:36:20 the same reason #ISIS took over some of the oil - to fund their sick operation.  This is what happens when a 5th grade drop out decides to be a killer. Ask grown up Sudanise child solders or the killers in south africa the TPLF regime uses as tactical example for more.
4717 2018-05-09 16:36:15 Royal Dutch Shell and Total signed deals to develop Iranian Oil and Gas fields. If they can no longer do business in Iran, Sinopec and Gasprom will move in, swiftly.

This is the 21st Century, money talks.
4718 2018-05-09 16:36:15 So we don't need Saudi oil.
4719 2018-05-09 16:36:04 Ummmmmm you live in the Middle East and have OIL!!!!!!  You’re energy is in the ground stupid
4720 2018-05-09 16:35:58 All a ploy to boost domestic oil prices
4721 2018-05-09 16:35:48 Coconut oil mixed with castor oil.also I only wash it once a week and wear a bonnet to sleep to avoid the moisture leaving my hair. Also tying it in woolen knots as an alternative to plating it when it’s too short to plat helps
4722 2018-05-09 16:35:46 Bright tomato is so good too!

4724 2018-05-09 16:35:36 By the way, "Rosneft" essentially means "Russian Oil." It is controlled by the Russian government, via a holding company known as "Rosneftegaz," essentially "Russian Oil and Gas."

4731 2018-05-09 16:35:02 We aren’t that dependent anymore on foreign oil. US is the # 1 oil producing country in the world. Backing out the Iran deal is effecting the price but not bc we lean on them for crude. Global demand for crude and tensions in countries that produce oil are pushing prices.
4732 2018-05-09 16:34:57 this man is a living breathing bottle of olive oil
4733 2018-05-09 16:34:56 France, England,&Germany actively trade with Iran!They buy oil from them!Their interest in the Nuclear agreement is purely financial!
4734 2018-05-09 16:34:45 I finally got coconut oil for my hair. I’m such a happy woman. Everyone needs friends like mine  #naturalhair
4735 2018-05-09 16:34:42 Trump's announcement that the U.S. is pulling out of the deal gives Iran the incentive to sell more oil that the previously agreed to cap. Trump's decision to exit the deal may do more harm to those who wanted to get rid off it.
4736 2018-05-09 16:34:42 Trump is doing his part of the agreement made by Erik Prince in the Seychelles. Trump declares war on Iran. Oil prices go up. Saudi Arabia, Gulf States, Russia and U.S. make a mint with the rise in oil prices and Iran's oil production taken off-line. Israel makes peace with Arabs
4737 2018-05-09 16:34:38 My healthy lifestyle includes dousing myself in oil and sitting in the sun for years
4738 2018-05-09 16:34:37 So who wins by pulling out of Iran deal?  Oil Companies.  Who loses?  Consumers paying 4.50 gallon gas.  Follow the money.  Sad.  #GOPTraitors #GOPTaxScam
4739 2018-05-09 16:34:29 Dianne 35. It reduces the oil production and stops breakouts, you might need something topical for clearing the dark marks tho
4740 2018-05-09 16:34:27 The curse, the curse of oil wealth. Lets keep it all to ourselves! Now how can we do that?
4741 2018-05-09 16:34:26 @realDonaldTrump @AbeShinzo @EmmanuelMacron The tax increases again to 900 euros / ton by 2020. After 2020, the tax will be determined by the French Ministry of Finance. For palm oil used for food products, the bill stipulates an additional tariff of 3.8 percent. @WorldBank #7642

4746 2018-05-09 16:33:49 oooh oooh ... do interest rates and oil next.   are they establishing a new breakout too?
4747 2018-05-09 16:33:41 Growing up, I used Clinique 3 step system because it addressed my hormonal skin inconsistencies. Now, my skin is pretty much balanced. I just wash and moisturize. I don't have any brand allegiance as long as it's oil free.
4748 2018-05-09 16:33:38 Is Trump Attacking the Iran Deal So Russia can sell more oil at higher prices after Iran oil is sanctioned?
4749 2018-05-09 16:33:31 The president doesn’t control the price of oil
4750 2018-05-09 16:33:30 started using Justine’s tissue oil about 2 weeks ago and I’m already seeing a great difference 
4751 2018-05-09 16:33:29 Did entire population hate him?   Not so sure.  Average Iranians doing terribly?  Maybe.  Post oil shock in 73. Put a crimp on Iran economy?  Caused more problems than other areas?  

 Not making statements, honestly interested.  Not so sure Shah was worse than what we got now.
4752 2018-05-09 16:33:26 Thanks to @realDonaldTrump and @AmbJohnBolton for causing oil prices to spike! Thanks for manufacturing a crisis, boys!

4757 2018-05-09 16:32:57 fun fact: the oil in the shell of a cashew is actually poisonous. which is why when you buy them they’re never in a shell and always roasted
4758 2018-05-09 16:32:42 Oil at $71 per barrel ... think about why and the consequences.
4759 2018-05-09 16:32:42 I disagree with everything beside the first sentence. I usually agree with most of what you say/believe but not today

Iran deal was bad for the world and good for Iran. If our SOME allies cant/wont see that and are thinking about oil only then we need 2 be on our own 4 a lil bit

 Germanistan who makes billions selling weapons to Iran, or Englandistan who loves Iran's oil ???

4773 2018-05-09 16:30:59 Perhaps because we find more value in their products and feel like we have a relationship with their technology... oil? Who cares right?

4776 2018-05-09 16:30:45 Oil prices are soaring now. Must make Trump’s buddies and overlords happy.

4779 2018-05-09 16:30:26 But what is the motivation for Iran to keep JCPOA? Sanctions on Oil, Banks , airplanes, oil industry are returining , and Iran is being advised by all Europeans to keep calm and stick to JCPOA,IAEA,and appendix! Kind of Good cop bad cop game EU/US are playing ?
4780 2018-05-09 16:30:25 So they'll sell the aircraft at a discount to a shell company that will sell them to Iran. Just as US tech companies sold telecom gear to companies who in turn sold it to Iraq which was under sanctions. Just as ISIL sold Syrian oil to Turkey who sold it to Israel.
4781 2018-05-09 16:30:16 Did you know...
World oil production was 82 million barrels per day in 2010.
World wind power production in 2010 was 0.3 petawatt-hours.
World solar power production in 2010 was 0.03 petawatt-hours.

4783 2018-05-09 16:30:02 To make sure he didn’t actually deal with prescription drug prices. He was paid to just talk about it but never get around to it. Now how many builders paid, and internet providers and private prisons and chemical companies and oil companies and mining companies etc etc etc.
4784 2018-05-09 16:30:00 Saudi Arabia may not have to supply any oil. Iran has just as much oil as Saudi Arabia. Why would Iran cut supply if Europe has vowed to keep buying Iranian oil despite Trump's announcement that the U.S. will pull out of the deal.
4785 2018-05-09 16:29:53 @JoyAnnReid @politico @TheLastWord @chrislhayes @maddow  Trump pulled US out of Iranian  deal because he is setting US up to go to war alongside of Russia our ENEMY to steal their oil. Same lie and playbook as Cheney with Iraq.  He said he would take the oil.
4786 2018-05-09 16:29:51 Tax money being used to protect not the land, not the water, not treaty-rights, not human rights, not Indigenous title, but a Texas oil corporation. This is 'Canada' according to @JustinTrudeau @liberal_party #UNDRIP #bcpoli #cdnpoli
4787 2018-05-09 16:29:47 What a load of rubbish, what about Israel’s nukes? Why won’t Israel open up its sites for inspection? Iran’s complying but all Israel and the racist neo con Christian Zionists want is war, to get their hands on Iran’s oil and gas. Israel is the rouge state in Middle East.
4788 2018-05-09 16:29:40 I notice in all the recent oil dialogue , no one is talking about how company's ability to drill more oil through advanced technology means is even being mentioned.  The production will sky rocket way more than any supply drawbacks. Will have huge reserves.
4789 2018-05-09 16:29:30 Whoever put baby oil on the hallway floors for a Senior prank Is a true genius lmao 
4790 2018-05-09 16:29:28 Tonight live at 6.30pm UK, @baldersdale talks to @IanKingSky about the impact of the US withdrawing the #Iran deal on the #oil markets. @SkyIanKingLive #OOTT
4791 2018-05-09 16:29:24 What got us into the great recession of 2008? #oilprices What got us into recovery in late 2014? Oil Prices.  Don't get too optimistic now.
4792 2018-05-09 16:29:07 If you had dignity (clearly you have none) you should stay away from this since it will come back to bite you in the not so distant future. But, no, you are Sean Hannity, snake oil salesman. Your heavily inbred audience surely appreciates you.

EIA forecasts that the total product net imports will fall from an annual average of 3.7 million b/d in 2017 to an average of 1.5 million b/d in 2019, which would be the lowest level of net imports since 1958.
4796 2018-05-09 16:28:58 I would.....raise taxes on oil and gas to pay for education. Also....a retractable roof over the state to keep it no hotter than 75 degrees at all times. More importantly I wouldn’t lie about being able to overturn federal laws
4797 2018-05-09 16:28:55 How come when i get my oil changed they find something wrong every time
4798 2018-05-09 16:28:52 American governments do not. Iran has too much oil to be left alone.
4799 2018-05-09 16:28:51 #Oil trading at its highest since November 2014. Brent up nearly 3% above $77 a barrel. WTI up 2.8% above $71 a barrel. #IranDeal #OOTT #OPEC #shale #commodities #markets #BrentCrude

4801 2018-05-09 16:28:38 guess what...a university is the "real world".  just as real as an oil  rig, a restaurant, a government agency, a factory, a bank.  to suggest that it is not is
 just an ad hominem attack of a weak  mind.
4802 2018-05-09 16:28:35 these days #recycling plastic food containers like crazy but our council insists they are clean which is fair enough. Trouble is to clean and break down the fat they contained one has to use detergent. Made from oil.
4803 2018-05-09 16:28:29 The way stretch marks on her booty look when it's lathered in baby oil & sunlight ..

4808 2018-05-09 16:28:14 Destroy Iraq just for their oil?
I don't think we have "taken" any oil from Iraq.
As soon as you give make one false statement, everything else you say is just blah, blah, blah.

Your mouth is an empty cup, that has nothing to spill.
4809 2018-05-09 16:28:07 I hate having to go get an oil change.. I hate having to go and do anything for my car

4811 2018-05-09 16:28:03 You are a destructive, negative, uninterested President, who just destroyed a TREATY with our allies.  You just want a war, so can TAKE their oil.
4812 2018-05-09 16:28:02 Putting peanut butter in my chicken + bell pepper stir fry is the best idea I've had. [Also: fresh garlic, fresh ginger, soy sauce, lime juice, toasted sesame oil, spring onions.] [But the peanut better is what makes it.]

4817 2018-05-09 16:27:41 Prior to tech companies taking over, oil giants were the most valuable.

How would we feel today if the leading online news sources were Exxon News, Royal Dutch Shell News, and Chevron News?

Why is our trust in tech companies so much higher than in other corporations?
4818 2018-05-09 16:27:37 So possible improvement in NK at the cost of: NATO security, allies in JCPOA, massive increase in Chinese influence in the world, trade wars (consumer price increases), reduced credibility in resolving internat'l conflicts, higher oil prices, on-going Russian tampering, etc

4827 2018-05-09 16:26:42 @POTUS The first big winner in pulling out of the Iran Deal: Big Oil. You wouldn't happen to be invested in oil, would you? Mind if I take a look at your tax returns?

4843 2018-05-09 16:25:22 For his zionist illusion of expansion. Get rid of Iran. US will take the oil and Israel will take the land.
4844 2018-05-09 16:25:22 Oil prices will continue to rise after Iran pulls its oil from the market. By making “America safer”, you’ve started a global oil war. Congratulations Moron in Chief!
4845 2018-05-09 16:25:17 Something conservatives keep missing when talking about #Trump accomplishments.  We have been fighting decades to open oil drilling in ANWAR.

4846 2018-05-09 16:25:16 At any cost I can't justify the act of companies involved in the extinction of Orangutan.Still it's a mystery how governments support the exploitation of country's natural resources to make profit on short term project?Is that necessary to expand palm oil plantations 1/3

4848 2018-05-09 16:25:13 Hmmdealing with issue that involves a country that has a GDP of $393 B, 80M citizens & ability to restrict the movement of 1/3 the worlds oil source versus grabbing headlines in a country with a GDP of $20B 7 23M citizens.

Didn't do well in quantitative comparison did you Donny
4849 2018-05-09 16:25:07 Bottom line OPEC does not matter. The bulls are reacting to noise and not the fundamentals. We are bearish on oil and bullish on natural gas.
4850 2018-05-09 16:25:07 What Trump did was strictly political without looking at the long road. Also, continues to isolate the US from its allies. Sure will help Russia with oil prices tho 
4851 2018-05-09 16:25:07 According to the Conference Board of Canada, Global demand for crude oil is estimated to remain strong in 2018
4852 2018-05-09 16:24:59 Amy, disagree TOTALLY. Decisions being made by Fox and Friends. A whole gob of people. Not Trump. He doesn’t read. He knows nothing of Iran deal, other than hawk’s opinions around him. Btw, oil up 4% in last 24 hrs. Hmmmmmmmmmmm

4858 2018-05-09 16:24:43 And the oil companies are going to pass that saving onto you!

4863 2018-05-09 16:24:35 Oil prices rose more than 2 percent, with Brent hitting a 3-1/2-year high with the decision to withdraw from #IranDeal ... i dare someone to tell me that this isn't about oil companies making $ 

@LastWeekTonight @iamjohnoliver
4864 2018-05-09 16:24:28 Yet we don't find people dumping oil in the ditches to avoid the cost of disposal and those we do are the only ones paying a penalty for their behaviour. Give us better example!
4865 2018-05-09 16:24:23 I think this is rooted more in supporting Iran’s enemy, Saudi Arabia. It’s no secret that Flynn & Kushner were working on a Ukrainian deal that would have Russia build nuclear reactors in Saudi Arabia. Also, no Iran deal spikes oil prices in Russia’s favor.

4872 2018-05-09 16:24:07 Everything about backing out of the Iran deal has potential negative effects on western economies and a resounding positive effect on Russian oil prices. Probably just a coincidence 
4873 2018-05-09 16:23:56 Obama put regulations on oil and gas industry under an executive order Trump changed all that. It's a fact believe it or not I know I'm living it I am making $80 extra every two weeks $160 a month less tax taken out my check I get paid every 2 weeks

4876 2018-05-09 16:23:47 Just think what our value will be when OIL is $100 a barrell 
4877 2018-05-09 16:23:37 Clients sure wouldn't pay for brutal calls you make. How is the short on oil at $64 looking. Shows why a leach can't make it in the real working world.
4878 2018-05-09 16:23:37 But if oil can move higher in tandem with stronger $ ( given regime shift in US energy trade ) does this correlation still hold ? Maybe
4879 2018-05-09 16:23:32 @ if a conflict trigger in the middle east with any evil intent of propping up oil economies of western preference, it'll be a terrible and strategic mistake leading to a wider armed crisis, if not the third world War itself!
4880 2018-05-09 16:23:29 Not quite sure what you’re asking, but lava can stay hot as long as it is being fed from the vent and insulated by a crust or rocks around it. It is much more viscous, something like 100-1000x stickier than motor oil!

1/ So after the Aussie GP, #Mercedes reverted back to their 2016 spec oil, because they were operating too close to the new limit of 0.6L. Now my question is, why go back to a 2 y/o spec oil? Why not 2017?
4883 2018-05-09 16:23:02 I think you’re right, gas prices are gonna go up for a while, especially with our heavy industries growing and increasing our energy demands. Good thing we’re poised to be the worlds leading producer of oil in less than 5 years. I never would’ve thought that was possible.

4885 2018-05-09 16:22:53 And who pays for the rise? People at the petrol pumps. The byproduct of this is Russia gaining a windfall from high oil prices so they can channel the money into meddling in world politics and wars. Putin is so happy!
4886 2018-05-09 16:22:41 Oil prices going up as a result of pulling out of Iran deal is good for Russia and Saudis. Guess who it’s not good for? The American people, including the Trumpists. #governedbythugs

4894 2018-05-09 16:22:17 Please buy as much as you can. i am sure you will sell much more lower. There are no serious buyer in the Markets. Only Centralbanks. I do defenetely not support this stupid game. Rising interests, rising Oil, rising debts......NO THANKS

4896 2018-05-09 16:22:09 The Department of Interior, which has led the way in cutting regulations, opened plans to lease 77 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico for oil and gas drilling.
4897 2018-05-09 16:22:09 I agree with you on that. I would think that the government helped oil companies way back when.

4903 2018-05-09 16:21:59 60ish years ago our gubmint overthrough the Iranian democratic govt and enabled Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to become its autocratic leader. The reason for this was the fact that Iran was going to nationalize its oil industry
4904 2018-05-09 16:21:54 Exactly... these dipshitz have such a short memory... all freaking out that oil is going up.. stfu, it was $150 a barrel under king barry.... gas almost $4.00... and guess what, we are now a major player in oil and gas - winning mfers... Keep America Great!
4905 2018-05-09 16:21:47 Oil climbed to three-and-a-half-year highs after Trump pulled the US out of the Iran nuclear pact, triggering renewed economic sanctions that could reduce the oil supply of an already tight market.
4906 2018-05-09 16:21:47 What happened to American oil?
4907 2018-05-09 16:21:45 bullish oil 1/2 assets
bullish palladium 969.8 1/2 assets
4908 2018-05-09 16:21:40 It's obviously gold because without electricity there is no bitcoin and ww3 would consume all the oil
4909 2018-05-09 16:21:39 Just look at Europe’s overall immigration policy. It’s a disaster. If Europe’s worried about oil, buy it from us. At the end of the day, Iran is a lot closer to Europe than to us. Let the Europeans solve the problem known as Iran. The world mocks us but always wants our help.

4916 2018-05-09 16:21:08 Nothing works diplomacy like oil at $147 a barrel. With America a oil power now, we can have a positive influence in the world. @CondoleezzaRice #CitrixSynergy #profound
4917 2018-05-09 16:21:06 And because we backed out of the Iran deal which everyone saw coming for awhile and they ship us oil and I really doubt they’re going to ship us any oil rn but that’ll be okay because we’re the number one producer of oil now

4931 2018-05-09 16:20:13 Nearly 20% of Iran’s oil is sold to the EU but more goes East than West. I’m not sure dealing in Euros will bother them much. They take Yuan, Yen, Won and Rupee for most of it.

4937 2018-05-09 16:19:54 Trump did the right thing and the best thing for the world . Oil is  the only reason anyone cares about Iran . We can live without them.
4938 2018-05-09 16:19:46 よくなった気がする。
4939 2018-05-09 16:19:37 Oil price UP. Helps Russia. Thanks, buddy.
4940 2018-05-09 16:19:35 Even if there are sanctions put on Iran, there will be no shortage of crude oil. Iran will still be able to sell to China, India, Japan and Turkey which are the largest buyers now of Iranian oil.
4941 2018-05-09 16:19:32 bullish crude oil 71.22 1/2 assets
4942 2018-05-09 16:19:32 And now we see, that's why, you wanted to make the oil people happy with the pledge, nothing else worked, so get out and then we can raise oil prices that way,
4943 2018-05-09 16:19:26 It’s your war over their oil #HandleYourBusiness
4944 2018-05-09 16:19:15 I just need my neck, back, ass, legs and feet rubbed down with baby oil 
4945 2018-05-09 16:19:14 I recall finding a pick-up truck where a rental sedan was supposed to be at #Calgary airport when picking up my brother at Foothills Medical after surgery his #Vancouver #oncologist recommended as the best team for his specific #cancer. Common sense universal #healthcare vs #oil?
4946 2018-05-09 16:19:14 aku pake yang oil free
4947 2018-05-09 16:19:06 I’m giving out 5 free oil changes at the shop today. Push up!
4948 2018-05-09 16:19:04 So oil pulling is undoing what my braces done  new video coming soon
4949 2018-05-09 16:19:02 石油だってオリーブオイルだって変わらぬオイルだ。だからみんな、資源は大切に使おう。
4950 2018-05-09 16:19:01 It’s because they don’t have enough oil for them

4953 2018-05-09 16:18:53 Drenched my face and body in coconut oil last night and my skin is currently thriving 

Living my best life lol
4954 2018-05-09 16:18:48 The crude oil market is running on bullish fumes and is ignoring the fundamentals which are overly bearish.
4955 2018-05-09 16:18:46 My point is why pull out now? If Iran was going to cheat catch them in the act then you will have everyone onboard and complete UN sanctions not Trump aliennating our allies and driving up oil prices which benefits noone but Russia.
4956 2018-05-09 16:18:39 We'll see how long all you Republicans praise this. Latest blunder. Oh, by the way how low are gas prices in South Dakota. as a result of this and eliminating export barriers on domestic oil?
4957 2018-05-09 16:18:32 اذا هوي قتل الجيش الكل ما رح يرحب فيه وما بشرفني اخدو لمطرح بس وقت لبرائتو ثابتة من هالتهمة بالذات وبدن بس يحاكموه لانو سب بسوريا وزعيما فشر على دولتي انو تدق فيه.كلن بسبوا فيا وقفت عليه ليه ما بيتحاكموا او لانن هني الدولة يسمحلن كل شي.على كلن الايام جاية والزمن قادر يكشفن منيح.
4958 2018-05-09 16:18:31 If you wanted to do a modern version of the Transformers-as-oil-crisis-metaphor, what would that look like? The advent of electric cars? Fears of alternative energy sources? Or society's inability to move onto non-oil energy sources despite their growing efficiency?

4961 2018-05-09 16:18:28 Home-made coffee scrub with olive oil. Lulur lavender. Body lotion lavender. Kulit seger, bobo enak!
4962 2018-05-09 16:18:26 How to tell that you are NOT addicted to social media - a drop of oil ignites the stove burner and you put it out instead of taking a picture of it.
4963 2018-05-09 16:18:26 I’m extremely independent when I want to get something done....until it’s time to get an oil change. This is where I let my dad handle things.
4964 2018-05-09 16:18:22 Conservative and guns, yes, but rednecks? Really? Most people I've met in other parts of the country seem to think of Dallas when they think of Texas - oil barons and big hair. Redneck stereotypes are the southern states to the east of us. Or do those not exist to California?
4965 2018-05-09 16:18:20 @MarkJamesGordon what is an urban kill em? can you please help me find a natural easy way to deworm. i tried hulda clark/walnut/wormwood snake oil, i want something that works! any suggestions, that are cheap and available, and proven :)
4966 2018-05-09 16:18:19 To be fair ... it’s Libya’s oil to do with what they wish. It was never “ours”. You’re kind of highlighting the ownership attitude we have such a problem displaying here from the States.
4967 2018-05-09 16:18:09 Why don’t they go solar if they want an environmentally-friendly power source.  Otherwise, there is plenty of oil they could use...
4968 2018-05-09 16:18:00 Of course they support it. Oil prices about to go up.

4971 2018-05-09 16:17:54 if all goes well, Abg Jo has successfully delivered 20% oil revenue back to Sarawak's coffer. I hoped the likely incoming minister Chong will make this happened and show the world how good Sarawak really is! ** Reader's discretion is advised
4972 2018-05-09 16:17:52 Look at oil...iran deal ROFL
4973 2018-05-09 16:17:50 i need to oil my scalp. need some castor oil and a good spray bottle for my rose water.
4974 2018-05-09 16:17:46 かわいい
4975 2018-05-09 16:17:44 To be so gullible as to believe taxing a small populated nation such as Canada  while developing nations ( much larger then ) push ahead with coal fired power plants and increased oil usage in an effort to reach a standard of living similar to ours .#CarbonTax #buildKM

4977 2018-05-09 16:17:37 A glib answer might be the relative importance of oil exports to the two economies. But I don’t disagree with you
4978 2018-05-09 16:17:36 US is now a net oil exporter so it’s actually good for us too in terms of GDP.
4979 2018-05-09 16:17:29 @terranovajoe How do the sanctions on IRAN actually impact oil supply chain so much, as a nation US is almost completely 100% independent with supply? Also increase spike and today's drilling technology will increase production exponentially.

4981 2018-05-09 16:17:24 Also noticed the price of crude jumped significantly after the USA withdrawal from the Iran Nucleur deal, so lots of American oil families having a knees up tonight!
4982 2018-05-09 16:17:20 This week I’ve watched Touch of Evil and Written on the Wind (Mubi). Holy mother of god, is all I’m saying. About both, but for entirely different reasons. Still laughing about closing shot of Wind, with Dorothy stroking the oil well.

4988 2018-05-09 16:17:02 @HalftimeReport @ScottWapnerCNBC Why so much worry about #wti at $70, remember stock market was going up & at their high at that time when #oil was at $100!
4989 2018-05-09 16:16:59 Exactly! trump is a dishonest thug - I hope the money funnels right from Russia to trump and he soon is history - it's all about Russian control for oil and the Middle East!
4990 2018-05-09 16:16:53 I cried a little bit this weekend when my car hit 1000 mi... I'm crying even more knowing I'm halfway to my first oil change....... :(
4991 2018-05-09 16:16:48 Lathered myself in coconut oil because the Internet told me to do it and the Internet has never lied to me before

4995 2018-05-09 16:16:41 Maybe, but there could be another leg up. correlation with spike/melt-up in oil prices before recessions is also visible. Korea numbers are very reliable, and two sources strengthens the case.
4996 2018-05-09 16:16:37 Putin only cares about enriching himself. Iran/oil, Syria/oil, Venezuela/oil. US/oil.
4997 2018-05-09 16:16:36 When the US froze Japanese assets and placed an oil embargo on them was that an act of war? The Japanese sure thought so.
4998 2018-05-09 16:16:29 Republic of Doyle's draw was some what under-rated  Todd - omg so many came from around the globe because of that show - that and the slump in oil

5001 2018-05-09 16:16:17 Of course.  That is all they have, oil.  Their economy is so small.  Oil, Oligarchs, and Large Washing Machines.
5002 2018-05-09 16:16:17 @realDonaldTrump dear mr. President,  what's up with the #Big oil exec's? Didn't they receive the same tax breaks as everyone else? 
I'm on a fixed income as was looking forward to some summer BBQ...I guess it's back to wieners.
5003 2018-05-09 16:16:08 I hate getting my oil changed without taking a male with me, the workers don’t take me seriously and they get so annoyed when I don’t let them up sell me

5005 2018-05-09 16:15:57 Just joshin' you. I actually did well-site geology for a year and sometimes break out my old hardhat occasionally to look at all the product logo and company stickers I accumulated, but oil& gas knowledge is far behind me now.
5006 2018-05-09 16:15:55 So oil prices have gone up with @realDonaldTrump messing with #JCPOA #IranDeal #IranNuclearDeal making US #fracking #shale based oil more viable? @bbcpm #c4news #newsnight as well as appealing pro-#Israel politicians
5007 2018-05-09 16:15:50 Sir will oil companies stay like this without increasing prices or will it only happen during election?
5008 2018-05-09 16:15:46 At 12:15pm  I got a correlation buy signal for the Crude Oil WTI Futures (CLM18) and USO on my software.

5012 2018-05-09 16:15:40 Google the steemit blog for explaining US action on non dollar sales of oil. Fascinating
5013 2018-05-09 16:15:36 There’s oil/petrol spilled on Link Road near Kuber Complex, opp Sab TV lane, Andheri (west). A bike just skid, luckily he was riding slow so wasn’t injured and the other bike which followed almost lost balance. Please help take the necessary action at the point. @MumbaiPolice
5014 2018-05-09 16:15:33 Jay- resources like oil are limited and costly from many perspectives. If you study the subject you may be better able to deal with the topic. It is troubling especially when we avoid. There is some excellent research available to you near the oil patch.
5015 2018-05-09 16:15:32 Venezuela and other SA oil countries will benefit from higher oil prices as well.  A teeny-tiny sliver of silver in a very dark cloud.

5019 2018-05-09 16:15:05 Im feeling like we need to be extremely cautious with the energy trades, this is a political rise in oil prices.
5020 2018-05-09 16:15:02 @CNBC @MadMoneyOnCNBC you folks need to realize that 50% of oil rigs are located in Permian, also realize today oil is selling for -12.75/bbl LESS than WTIC price, you want to move your oil, thats the price due to lack of transportation infrastructure.. refiners banking
5021 2018-05-09 16:14:46 As long as there is a market for their oil, there is no incentive to change
5022 2018-05-09 16:14:37 More like Saudi Arabia needs the gas prices. Upcoming Saudi Aramco IPO needs high prices, and IMF recently released a report noting the Saudi budget (largest in their history) needs oil prices in the mid to high 80's to be sustainable.
5023 2018-05-09 16:14:27 Man City fans trying to start a rivalry with us  fuckin small club! Where were u before oil money? Fuckin 2 leagues down thats where! Villa and Forest are more successful

5025 2018-05-09 16:14:19 Awesome should be a country wide thing start getting away from coal oil and gas.
5026 2018-05-09 16:14:18 Again disingenuous Where does all of this protest and obstruction come from. It’s paid for and organized by US and other foreign competitors that don’t want to compete with Canadian oil.

4 years of consultation, 157 special conditions not required in any other place in the world

5028 2018-05-09 16:14:11 The Korean “deal” was happening on Tuesday. Nothing to do with Iran. And the rest of the world is ignoring us in this regard. So, Iran has no motivation to talk to@us. And I might add that gas prices for us will go up with less oil from Iran in the market.
5029 2018-05-09 16:14:03 Ima ingest this oil and magically be transported into 1996

5032 2018-05-09 16:13:49 And isn't Russia absconding with #Venezuala oil company???!!!
5033 2018-05-09 16:13:47 Trump is a dangerous man, with his ignorance. War and Koch oil is all that matters.
5034 2018-05-09 16:13:44 I think that people can get confused with natural methods and homeopathy.

Things like honey have excellent natural properties whereas homeopathy is just snake oil!
5035 2018-05-09 16:13:42 The Russians are saying, just now, that oil prices will go up, which is good for Russia. We'll watch the numbers and see if you retract this idiocy.
5036 2018-05-09 16:13:42 The Department of Interior, which has led the way in cutting regulations, opened plans to lease 77 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico for oil and gas drilling.
Trump traveled the world to promote the sale and use of U.S. energy.

5041 2018-05-09 16:13:18 @HalftimeReport I DISAGREE with @terranovajoe that higher energy/oil/gasoline IS GOOD for the economy - it is actually ONE OF THE BIGGEST concerns for the average American consumer and economic growth. I agree with @stephenLweiss
5042 2018-05-09 16:13:11 Oil prices up $2 a barrel! Olde moonbeam is elated! Finally we will break the back of the freeloading middle class! Now we got more money for illegals! 
5043 2018-05-09 16:13:10 @POTUS When you backed of the Iran deal Ohio paid the price! They raised our gas price to $2.89.9 per gallon!
I don't blame you President Trump But something needs to be done with big oil in America! They are out for big profit.
Do we eat or put gas in our cars?
5044 2018-05-09 16:13:01 I agree that there had been those kinds of discussions and negotiations. The relations however were starting to pick up. The EU wanted access to their oil fields, through Italy. The Obama administration gave it to them in a silver platter.
5045 2018-05-09 16:12:58 IsIs is the creation of Israeli and american agencies (mossad and CIA). They are created to  capturing oil lands, scaring arab rulers and damaging muslim identity. Lots of mangoes in a single stone

5049 2018-05-09 16:12:43 Q- Is oil involved?
A- That’s all you need to know.
5050 2018-05-09 16:12:28 Oil benchmarks on extended bull run #WTI (+2.81%) at $71.00/bbl, #Brent (+2.83%) at $76.95/bbl morning after 'The Donald's' intervention #OOTT #oilandgas
5051 2018-05-09 16:12:27 Nothing worse than getting my oil changed. They always talk me into stuff!
5052 2018-05-09 16:12:18 As I told you, Europe didn't respond because it had joined banking sanctions against Iran. After 2012, there were other sets of sanctions on Iranian oil and central bank.
You will see how EU will protect its businesses in the following weeks. Be patient.
5053 2018-05-09 16:12:15 That's what a work friend does. She uses the pressure blankets for her son and lavender oil. She sits where he can see her and sings to him a song he likes. She sings it to him every night before he goes to sleep. 

It'll be over before you and he knows it. Then a big ole hug!
5054 2018-05-09 16:12:09 Dei Najib sold our oil bank in Terengganu still Terengganu fellas vote for BN. WTF
5055 2018-05-09 16:12:02 The simple way to look at it is that Scotland could have a massive Sovereign Oil fund like Norway. In fact, I read a report by two oil experts at Aberdeen University looking at North Sea oil after the price collapse. They said it was inexcusable that the UK did not have one now.
5056 2018-05-09 16:11:56 "Export Capacity will be further allocated pursuant to a formula contained in a confidential

Oh, please, Russia. You’re thrilled. Going to make trillions off your oil when prices go up again.
5059 2018-05-09 16:11:22 Let's have your answer:

Nigeria - Crude Oil = ?
5060 2018-05-09 16:11:20 Yeah that's true, i know a lot about those things. Esp coz i got info about joining in with some people to trade oil from KRG to Europe. They area all in on it, everybody from PUK,Gorran, the new party shit, PDK etc.
5061 2018-05-09 16:11:09 Speaking of mechanics. I went to Mr Lube to get an emission test to get my sticker renewed (apparently I didn’t even need that) why did the man do a full out oil change without me knowing. So I’m looking at the machine like hm 160 for an emission test???

So, show me what subsidies are you talking about for oil.
5065 2018-05-09 16:11:00 Only in America!...Capitalists can go into someone else's back yard, drill wells & lay down pipe, contaminate soil with fracking solvents & leaked oil, then walk away w/million$. Only in America!

Are you aware that IRAN was under OIL sanction by UN due to its nuclear programmer & under these sanctions no one can pay them legally. If you will study u`ll find it. Instead of asking me.
5070 2018-05-09 16:10:30 The Iran Nuclear deal exit makes absolutely no sense other than perhaps to manipulate the price of oil. Did Kushner promise the Saudis something in return for his line of credit? #IranDeal
5071 2018-05-09 16:10:28 Russia uses and expands, they need to expand territory for their system to work. Entire country is riddled with sinkholes from drilling oil.  

Making nice with them isn't terrible, but eventually they will then find advantage and move to expand.

5073 2018-05-09 16:10:16 @gorillacd The Democratic Republic of Congo is planning to drastically shrink Salonga and Virunga National Parks to allow oil drilling. 25% of the world's critically endangered Mountain #Gorillas live there. Reports are poachers are already clearing them out. Is this true?!

5078 2018-05-09 16:09:39 Also, sad article. I wonder if Kermit had any idea of what his decision would bring, apart from all the oil money.
5079 2018-05-09 16:09:34 Save several thousand quid opting not to purchase innocuous bucolic pastoral oil (peasants forking straw inta wagon). These days, zero interest unless 10,000% profit can be generated. (Being honest tho', a blood, guts & horror subject matter may have tipped balance.)

5081 2018-05-09 16:09:20 @realDonaldTrump does any body but me see. The only people making out on this Iran deal is pres’s friends in oil buisness. Prices go up so does thier bank accounts. Not ours
5082 2018-05-09 16:09:15 No surprise that @realDonaldTrump and Saudi oil will make MILLION$ as crude oil prices rise after he pulled out of the #IranNuclearDeal - the Long Con of America continues!

5085 2018-05-09 16:09:04 @HalftimeReport In today's world , the spike in oil will increase productivity , even with sanctions in place, the drilling technology today will oversupply the market. It will level off.

5087 2018-05-09 16:08:54 The largest sources of U.S. imported oil were: Canada (40%), Saudi Arabia (11%), Venezuela (9%), Mexico (8%), and Colombia (4%). According to the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and natural gas industry supports nine million U.S. jobs...Maybe not!
5088 2018-05-09 16:08:51 Bombing children for the oil market again? 
#MAGAts don't care - they eat their own.
5089 2018-05-09 16:08:47 And y’all ruin ur cars because ur Driving ur whips with no oil in it. Which ends up costing u even more. Check your oil ever 4-6 months and you’ll be bless.
5090 2018-05-09 16:08:40 Cause of all this is not only the TRAIN law itself. It was the unexpected global rise of oil prices in the first quarter that triggered everything.
5091 2018-05-09 16:08:38 I never use heat, I just air dry it and keep it natural, sometimes I will put oil on the ends and dry shampoo for texture  I wash it every other day and try to do a deep conditioner once a week!
5092 2018-05-09 16:08:24 Oil was down yesterday. The majority of Iran's oil is sold to China.
5093 2018-05-09 16:08:18 3rd in a war scenario - China gets its oil cut off by India and Japan and guess who gets to play on Chinese territory again - the Japanese! China has no friends in its region. And the Ruskies have a tendency to break alliances with weak players.

5095 2018-05-09 16:08:04 Reinhart trade (arguably prior regime as Chia brand-new) was the real disaster. Not only failure of the trade. But it put Oil yr behind in securing rock solid foundational D, which turned up pressure contributing to Lars/Hall deal. Less desperate, maybe Ebs + picks gets Lars.
5096 2018-05-09 16:08:01 I apply the shea butter first followed by the almond oil.

5098 2018-05-09 16:07:57 Now it would be harder to sell or renegotiate anything because of the  animosity displayed by this administration, aside from being a terrible snake oil salesman that we have experienced he’s untrustworthy.
5099 2018-05-09 16:07:56 The U.S. has always wanted to be a net energy exporter. The US will need more markets for its oil and US exploration of shale has proven to be a viable alternative for its expansion -Afetsi Awoonor, Petroleum Trader. #AIPNAfrica #CenturionLawGroup
5100 2018-05-09 16:07:55 Further, the price of oil is determined by the global market.  This is well known fact.  Presidents do not determine the price of gas.
5101 2018-05-09 16:07:52 Thank you Mr. Trump!!!
Since you took office West Virginia coal fields and gas and oil fields are Rockin'
You are doing an awesome job in all aspects as far as im concerned. Wish they would leave you the Hell alone and let u do what u do!
5102 2018-05-09 16:07:49 there is almost no such thing as a male photographer that’s crazy lmfao, trust no man with a camera and any type of white backdrop and a bottle of baby oil, he’s gonna do you the dirtiest
5103 2018-05-09 16:07:48 At the gas pump for sure!.. Oil Industry gets richer even more?
5104 2018-05-09 16:07:46 That's just how I used to feel checking the oil in my 1998 Ford Fiesta! It was red so totally Ferrari, obviously when driving I was Schumacher!
5105 2018-05-09 16:07:39 Thank you @BarackObama @HillaryClinton @JoeBiden for causing mass global hysteria resulting in increase fuel prices. Surely you all got you oil stick bought

5109 2018-05-09 16:07:25 Yeah saw that, wtf is that shit? KRG should have a annual budget report. At least, you can find Annual oil reports.
5110 2018-05-09 16:07:24 More than that... on Russian TV they were wondering how Putin was going to fund his initiatives and then when our withdrawal was announced, they said it was good for Russia because the price of oil would now go up!
5111 2018-05-09 16:07:21 He’s begging for it to happen he wants the oil has been saying it for years.

5113 2018-05-09 16:07:13 I used to be a candle girl (and still am), but my aroma diffuser is changing my life. Being able to work for hours while lavender essential oil is infused in the air around me is relaxing, stimulating, and refreshing all at the same damn time. I'm in love.

5115 2018-05-09 16:07:05 Sir, oil is one of the few product prices where the price can be dictated by the supplier. The demand for oil has some power however, does not have enough strength due to its low number of producers.
5116 2018-05-09 16:07:02 From what I understand, the NEB determines the allocation of the pipeline not the shippers, and they reallocated it as recently as two years ago,

Parkland (then Chevron) was receiving less that their capacity and resorted to building an oil-by-rail facility.
5117 2018-05-09 16:07:02 as fresh water becomes depleted (happening sooner then you would think) this is guaranteed to happen. one day nations will be going to war over fresh water like oil is today. Unless tech makes ocean water viable/cheap
5118 2018-05-09 16:06:56 Apple cider vinegar mixed with tea tree oil is a good alternative to shampoo on wash days y’all.
5119 2018-05-09 16:06:53 Thanks trump. Higher gas prices and a risk of war, what more could we ask for.
Oh wait, now China will pour more money into its Iranian oil works and cut off buying from Canada.
Where was that pipeline supposed to go?
5120 2018-05-09 16:06:48 You possibly forgot the old o ring in the oil filter when changing it. If it was left behind the new one can't tightly press into the housing

5123 2018-05-09 16:06:32 Pro-Tip: you can bring your own oil and filter to the mechanic and just pay them for the 20 minutes it takes to change it
5124 2018-05-09 16:06:25 Oil prices are up! Putin smiles.
5125 2018-05-09 16:06:24 Maybe if we someone spread the rumour that Mars had oil we would have colonies there by now.... bad luck! 

Stop spending on weaponry and wars, explore space and advance human interests there.
5126 2018-05-09 16:06:19 Remove anything inside the U.S. borders that come from-
- China
- E.U.
- Japan
plus higher taxes on exported U.S. oil, Jeans, Whisky, iPhones, Webservices and so on.

5127 2018-05-09 16:06:05 Now we know why trump opened up the national monument lands for uranium mining. #IranNuclearDeal is a two part for profit deal. Of course oil prices are going to rise. Greed shows it's ugly trump again.
5128 2018-05-09 16:05:52 Midnight Oil. Social activism music that birthed an actual political force when their singer was elected to Parliament. Plus the tunes are excellent
5129 2018-05-09 16:05:46 Pound has gone down against the dollar last few weeks. Oil is priced in $. And then the Iran thing has put the price of oil up.

5134 2018-05-09 16:05:22 Who is waiting for Iranian oil production to drop?
5135 2018-05-09 16:05:08 Sadly, that is the feelings at the heart of most of the environmentalists. It is why they want laws and treaties. No one legislated coal fired ships out of existence. Oil and then Diesel was better. Coal fell by the wayside.
5136 2018-05-09 16:04:49 Denmark nationalized the oil and distributes the wealth to the people. This is a socialist platform.

5143 2018-05-09 16:04:20 Made sense, more or less, till yesterday. With 'pay to play' now exposed, my instinct is that, while trashing Obama's legacy may be satisfying for DJT, he's chasing pay-offs. Look for coal & oil co's paying wrt Paris, insurance co's wrt ACA, Saudi's & Israeli's wrt JCPOA, etc.
5144 2018-05-09 16:04:20 This was the plan all along: STEAL Iran’s OIL! It was never about the nukes...
5145 2018-05-09 16:03:52 You must have been autocorrected. *Big Oil’s need for new pipelines is critical. Only 3% of Canada’s GDP from #tarsands... #Canada will be just fine without more #pipelines.

Remember that when the USA who have had 54 wars in 270 years are telling you Iran are the bad guys.
Iran wants nukes not to attack jews,,to protect their oil from the west

5154 2018-05-09 16:03:17 Oil was over $100 a barrel for years before Trump came into office. Check on that for yourself.
5155 2018-05-09 16:03:14 With the withdrawal of US from this deal, Israel will provoke you till you retaliate. once that happens, there won't be much defense to protect you and your oil from the US and Suadi Arabia. Do not be to rash to fight back. Think of your families
5156 2018-05-09 16:03:13 To answer your question, no I don't. Oil and gas drive our economy and pay for our hospitals, schools, etc. Without that industry, we're in trouble.
5157 2018-05-09 16:03:06 My personal opinion is that American oil companies want a pipeline through Iran something that wont happen right now.

5164 2018-05-09 16:02:36 The UN has never backed anything the US has ever done. But they sure run to us when there's trouble or money needed. Oil prices go up and down a the time. And Israel is always ready for an attack. And a deal that was so soft on monitoring. I feel perfectly safe. Semper Fi.

5166 2018-05-09 16:02:28 The 1980 start to this thread means they didn't wait long after Iran nationalised it's oil in 1979 to get their proxy war.

5202 2018-05-09 16:00:11 Most supermarkets do vegan spreads made from oils such as sunflower oil, try looking for the brand VitaLite.
5203 2018-05-09 16:00:05 OILがひたすらﾓﾐﾓﾐ
5204 2018-05-09 16:00:04 World price of OIL $70 a barrel, in the 80s that price gas at pump was about $1 a gal. I know cost have gone up, but $3.50 a gal.? WTF chalk it up to MAGA?? I have seen no increase in my POCKET have you, COLA going up SO MUCH WINNING MAKE IT STOP! TRUMPS WORDS JUST SAYING!
5205 2018-05-09 16:00:03 Yep.  Oil went up a few bucks a barrel
5206 2018-05-09 16:00:03 KARMA DEALS!! 30% off CAKE POPS! Oil Well LR 3 for $90! CSC syringes 25% OFF! Crx and Green Dot Silver Label $27/g! Spend $100,get a cookie!
5207 2018-05-09 16:00:00 Over the next month, watch where oil prices go. We are entering the peak travel season, gas prices have already en on the rise. Now they'll be riding a rocket higher. Saudis and Russian need the extra to finance their governments. We just gave it to them.
5208 2018-05-09 15:59:57 I don't understand how the oil brush tool works on procreate but I'm all here for the textures it make
5209 2018-05-09 15:59:56 It is all about making oil more expensive for his bromance putin.
5210 2018-05-09 15:59:37 Is cheaper oil from Saudis( Basically Higher Production) a part of the deal?? Or does Oil at 70+ support fracking which I assume is Trump's Base?
5211 2018-05-09 15:59:35 my aunt basically told my grandma to give one of her finished oil paintings to someone for free, people think artists just live on air alone and art just magically appears I guess
5212 2018-05-09 15:59:29 Yeah, I hate to be conspiracy boy, but there's no way that wasn't planned and a justification to in for the oil in Iraq.
5213 2018-05-09 15:59:28 That’s a great compliment! There must be essence of the Fountain of Youth in that beard oil. 
5214 2018-05-09 15:59:20 Mr President do something about the oil please
5215 2018-05-09 15:59:15 Seriously, the cartoon they all remember from the 80s should make it blindingly obvious- pretty sure some eps even had oil directly poured into Energon cubes.
5216 2018-05-09 15:59:15 Isn’t coconut oil thicker??
5217 2018-05-09 15:58:56 @CNN It just occured to me wouldn't Russian Oil interests benefit from sanctions on Iran? Perhaps someone smarter than me should look into that?
5218 2018-05-09 15:58:46 A super run in oil stocks as we posted here over the last several weeks.   Some nice gains $PXD and others.

5220 2018-05-09 15:58:38 Yesterday the news said oil jumped to $70 high because @POTUS left Iran deal. Today same news said oil went down because prez left the deal. That’s why I don’t ever trust the news. My “guess” is as good as theirs! @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson @CNN @ABC @CBSNews
5221 2018-05-09 15:58:35 I have, the data SNP are using is ancient. Fracking has been happening in England since 70’s. Also road SNP going down, in court, will prevent some of the North Sea oil extraction, as it’s fracked. 
The Scottish Numpty Party.
5222 2018-05-09 15:58:34 Yes. Scientists are the primary reason we all don't die from polio and why vaccinations work. It's good your internet functions, it's how we convert oil from dead dinosaurs into fuel for our vehicles.
5223 2018-05-09 15:58:31 God bless my mother for this bottle of pure coconut oil
5224 2018-05-09 15:58:30 Just saw Derrick Favors walking through the parking lot of the practice facility with a backpack on. I asked him if he's beginning a summer backpacking tour. He's not. His truck is just getting its oil changed at a nearby mechanic.

5227 2018-05-09 15:58:09 Petrol price 2 years ago 108p, 1 year ago 117p, now 124p on average. And with oil on the up, petrol/diesel set to rise further. Something for Bank of England rate-setters to think about tomorrow?
5228 2018-05-09 15:57:57 Actually the entire oil patch is about 10% of GDP, but the #tarsands are only 2%.    Not exactly a financial disaster to shut the whole tarsands down and invest in renewables.  That would employ more people than a #pipeline.
5229 2018-05-09 15:57:55 I’m having an oil change for lunch.. what about yall? 
5230 2018-05-09 15:57:55 This is another fact about PMB progressive  government,wailers should tell us which of the past government agencies have generated revenue like PMB government agencies apart from oil?
5231 2018-05-09 15:57:54 Oil is at a 3 and a half year high, thanks to @realDonaldTrump. Also, Russia had a military parade, Trump wants one, and I swear it feels like 1950.
5232 2018-05-09 15:57:53 What about all the friends of Trump that will make billions on the rising price of oil? It’s always about money. Saudi Arabia, Texas Oil Barons Shale Oil will all be happy as we the masses pay thru the nose. Besides the nuclear threat.
5233 2018-05-09 15:57:50 Okay for the federal govt to subsidize oil and gas industry, Bombardier, etc. But god forbid it should help journalism, the lifeblood of our democracy...#cdnpoli @melaniejoly
5234 2018-05-09 15:57:45 Oh -I thought it was a one-time thing. But actually old oil gets rancid so probably a good idea to do it daily.

5236 2018-05-09 15:57:25 That's a running crab spider (Philodromidae). Yes, they are pretty fast, but quite harmless. No point worrying about the traditional methods that people cite (peppermint oil etc.) as they don't actually work when properly tested. I catch 'em with a little pooter (aspirator).

5240 2018-05-09 15:57:09 I swear by coconut oil x
5241 2018-05-09 15:57:07 The problems with continuing to extract and burn oil and gas aren’t perceived vices, they have measured effects.
5242 2018-05-09 15:57:07 MOISTURIZE MT SITUATION! Don’t nobody want an ashy ass. Or mineral oil. Or petroleum!
5243 2018-05-09 15:57:05 And sweetener, pharmaceutical & chemical companies...and now oils...I just saw an entire display at a grocery store saying corn oil was healthier than olive oil...and people wonder why we’re one of the richest nations yet overwhelmed with chronic disease...
5244 2018-05-09 15:57:01 Anyone with a brain regrets it. Not to mention he has driven up gas prices and guaranteed China will be pouring more money into its own oil fields in Iran instead of buying from Canada.
5245 2018-05-09 15:57:01 ใสๆไง 5555
5246 2018-05-09 15:57:00 Start a war with Iran, and do what he feels what others felt was wrong,  overtake their oil supply?
5247 2018-05-09 15:56:47 #Trump is giving #Putin and #Russia a pay day by getting out of the #NuclearDeal  with #Iran now the Russians don’t have to compete with Iran to sell oil.  Oil and gas prices are going up there goes your bullshit #Tax break Thank the Republicans!
5248 2018-05-09 15:56:45 Since President knows everything CIA knows per Haspel I know he knows that geology keeps the U.S. and others from invasion and the flow of oil from a true attack.
5249 2018-05-09 15:56:42 Definitely!
5250 2018-05-09 15:56:34 So oil prices are increasing after@Trump@dump of Iran deal. So that bigly tax cut for Middle/ lower income folks is going to get partially eaten at the pump. This is just for starters.
5251 2018-05-09 15:56:32 Data are to this century what oil was to the last one: a driver of growth and change. Flows of data have created new infrastructure, new businesses, new monopolies, new politics and—crucially—new economics.  "The economist"

5254 2018-05-09 15:56:22 Really? What's he done to help with 1 single thing @Tiffanyoneill67 mentioned?

Made oil drilling, fracking, and mining less safe. Made it legal to dump waste into rivers. Allowed air pollution for corporate donors...

But regulations for regular people? Nothing.

You got conned.

5256 2018-05-09 15:56:04 One of the best.
5257 2018-05-09 15:56:01 Consumption growth has been mainly driven by job expansion, in lieu of rising wages or re-leveraging. Two caveats: the steep fall in oil prices boosted raise incomes, and more recently the savings rate has fallen off quite a bit.
5258 2018-05-09 15:56:00 Has anyone considered this fact? Russia has oil, but it is not profitable to extract it unless oil is $100/bbl. or more. Trump’s withdrawal from the Iranian Nuke deal means sanctions which would reduce Iran’s production = rising oil prices. Putin says thanks lil’ Donnie Dotard!
5259 2018-05-09 15:55:56 Trump's oil buddies seem happy, prices are up.
5260 2018-05-09 15:55:48 The S&P 500 rose on Wednesday as energy shares jumped on the back of a strong rally in oil prices. The index's move higher follows President Donald Trump's decision to pull the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal.

5265 2018-05-09 15:55:36 I am guilty of that. I pronounce oil & boil as one syllable. One of the few things we take away syllables rather than add.

5273 2018-05-09 15:55:06 The price of crude oil has more than doubled since Trump took office. The impact of Trump pulling out of the Iran deal is a windfall for Vladimir Putin as oil prices will quickly return to the $100 a barrel mark putting trillions of rubles in Putin's pocket.
5274 2018-05-09 15:55:00 Girl for your pretty ass hair you can use anything!! Try a curling cream and add the lightest oil possible after just for shine! You barely need it
5275 2018-05-09 15:54:53 Sir, didn't you once try to remove investment in the US oil patch in an effort to run them out of business?

5287 2018-05-09 15:53:59 HAY, HOW ABOUT THE OIL PRICES!! UP 3% OVER NIGHT!! WTF DID YOU DO?!?
5288 2018-05-09 15:53:56 The answer is simple nah. Abi you still want me to tell you that Buhari and his children are lazy and waiting for oil money for treatment abroad and to shine teeth on FB? I won't say so
5289 2018-05-09 15:53:53 They've certainly been able to use money from oil to further their aims and bases in the M-East and support for terrorist Hezbullah in Lebanon as West closed their eyes to their activities.
5290 2018-05-09 15:53:48 Just stop it. You'll sell enough oil to keep the right people wealthy for years. Your deliberate attempts to support O&G sector by misrepresenting science sux. There are (for now) ways to transition to cleaner energy such that the economy & majority of population is protected.
5291 2018-05-09 15:53:44 Trump’s oil buddies will profit immensely from Iran decision. Oil is already at 70$ per barrel.  Anyone not seeing through this charade needs to go to the pool of Siloam.
5292 2018-05-09 15:53:39 This is the longest oil change wait in human history!
5293 2018-05-09 15:53:27 So basically it smells like oil leaks, burnt fuses, and cheap leather that's made to look expensive, but really isn't.
5294 2018-05-09 15:53:26 No, you are welcome to enjoy your celebrations.

But why compare to other clubs? Especially when the reason your piping up is because of oil money. You would not be trying to banter other clubs without it.

I hope you guys can try it. There is no other medicine that does so much with so little side effect.

5310 2018-05-09 15:51:59 Oil or conditioner
5311 2018-05-09 15:51:58 Nah. Just follow the money. The Iran deal lifted sanctions on Iranian oil production. Destabilise the Middle East and strengthen the dollar stranglehold on oil production. It’s gross cynical evil
5312 2018-05-09 15:51:56 Baby oil or olive oil. Something slippery will loosen it up.
5313 2018-05-09 15:51:46 So if you believe that the export of oil is bad for Americans than you support increases in domestic exploration and production. You just want that oil to be sold to American companies?  On this we agree.

5321 2018-05-09 15:51:17 Why do oil change places say, “So we can do this, that, and this to help your car for only $500!” as if a) I, a queer, would understand what they’re saying or b) I, a queer nonprofit employee, have that kind of money?
5322 2018-05-09 15:51:16 i agree that Saudi has major oil export bussiness. Wikileaks revealed how hillary and Saudi created ISIS to defeat Assad shia regime. and how they gave them training. And about Oil everybody know it who buys oil from ISIS.

5334 2018-05-09 15:50:16 Example...dollar was 99 feb 2016 and oil was $30 a barrel
5335 2018-05-09 15:50:10 Sharting. Gambled and lost. The fart that wasn't.  The unexpected trouser guest. The numb bum that came up rum. Surprise chocolate delivery. The oil that caused the skid. 

You get it now 
5336 2018-05-09 15:50:09 “I was so desperate I used vegetable oil to tan, I was making myself a four course meal”
5337 2018-05-09 15:49:58 Here in Cleveland Ohio I am seeing Oil trains from out west again.  The pumps in dikota must be on
5338 2018-05-09 15:49:51 Ah, shea butter does that to me. Before I went organic I used Clean and Clear Oil Control, the entire line is solid.
5339 2018-05-09 15:49:50 ohk i agree but what all Sunni force of Saudi and arab are doing at Yaman? what is Yaman war? Why They keep buying oil from ISIS? why Sunni Iraq had war with Shia Iran? It's all sectarian war. Please read it.
5340 2018-05-09 15:49:45 Best statement in the article. "Kenney is playing both sides of this debate and if he is successful it could mean the absolute denial of increased access for Alberta oil.  He'll blame the Liberals and the NDP but this is on him and his desperate attempt to fuel anger for votes."
5341 2018-05-09 15:49:34 Apparently it's beyond your comprehension. Oh look, another foreigner just died to keep us in oil. 
And another. 
And another...
5342 2018-05-09 15:49:25 There should never have been seismic work done or areas closed from fishing. The footprint those rigs leave are small during the operations but if an accident were to happen the footprint would be catastrophic.
Do you really think us little guys can change big oil and gas?
5343 2018-05-09 15:49:17 君を揚げたいな…君を炒めたいな…君に僕を絡めたいな…僕は君のそんな存在になりたい。いや、既になってるだろう?
5344 2018-05-09 15:49:16 S/o to the boy Trump for pulling out of the Nuclear Deal and raising oil prices higher than my GPA :)) I’m already fuckin broke
5345 2018-05-09 15:49:02 Probably something that mutated out of the muck they created with that "dispersal agent" they sprayed on the oil well blowout.
5346 2018-05-09 15:48:57 2,400,000 civilians in Vietnam. Plus 1,200,000 real and arguable combatants. That's 3,600,000 dead from roughly 17,000,000 population to start.

1,445,000 total extra deaths in Iraq. That was for an oil grab.

Rogue state ??? Fuck no......
5347 2018-05-09 15:48:56 Smoke and mirrors. You are propping up this snake oil salesman.

5349 2018-05-09 15:48:52 Tri-Power is now stocking hydraulic oil in 32,46 and 68 weight. We also have 303 and UTF tractor fluid. These products compliment our full line of hydraulic hoses and fittings. Hoses made while you wait! Decrease down time.
5350 2018-05-09 15:48:51 Maybe their translation matrix is poor, and it's really "strange things you don't need to know about".  And walnut oil actually IS a thing(at least in SF).  Occasionally used in a $15 salad that will fit in a coffee cup.  At least they don't attempt to label it a noun.
5351 2018-05-09 15:48:48 Every product we produce and export increases our economy and does NOT just help “oil companies”. don’t be naive
5352 2018-05-09 15:48:26 Putting Mandela and Maimane surname is like mixing water and oil
5353 2018-05-09 15:48:25 US wars in the middle-east are all about multinational oil co's, and protecting the Saudis, and Israel. I think it's a sin....  We're not a democracy, we're a corporatocracy, and an Empire. Doesn't matter much who the #POTUS is....
5354 2018-05-09 15:48:24 Iran produces 3 million barrels, China buys 9 million. Will Trump sanction China for buying? Will voters sanction Republicans for surging gasoline prices? Sanctions go through the banking system. Does yuan trading in oil get affected? Trump sanctions in sum just hot air.
5355 2018-05-09 15:48:22 Tea tree oil!!! It used to happen to me occasionally and I’d soak the end of the q-tip and place it on my nose piercing for about 10-15 seconds then clean carefully around the piercing. It would settle down and go away after a day or two
5356 2018-05-09 15:48:15 If you own long term, once you add the higher cost of fuel, oil changes, brake jobs (e-cars regenerate), coolant changes, etc. over lifetime, cost gets pretty similar.

5358 2018-05-09 15:47:56 #Russia's state TV is having a panel discussion as to where to find 8 trillion rubles needed to implement Putin’s domestic policy goals. Female host says: "Looks like we found it. Trump is withdrawing US from the #Iran nuclear deal. Oil prices should go up, which is good for us."
5359 2018-05-09 15:47:54 I believe that was part of his motivation for it, but I'm pretty sure this is part of a larger plan to topple the Iranian gov't and control the flow of oil out of the Persian Gulf. As Richard Dreyfus said in "W." - "No one will ever fuck with us again."
5360 2018-05-09 15:47:47 “We planted a fuckload of invasive trees that produce copious amounts of a highly flammable oil in our dry, arid region prone to decades long droughts! Why is half of the state on fire??

5362 2018-05-09 15:47:45 Hope they didn't get sold oil changes for life! Or anything else based on your dealership keeping its word.
5363 2018-05-09 15:47:45 Unscrewing Obama’s failed policies. From trade, regulation rollback, Paris climate agreement, Iran nuclear deal, approving Dakota Access & Keystone XL oil pipeline, enforcing immigration laws & rebuilding our military. It’s great putting America & our interests first! #MAGA
5364 2018-05-09 15:47:44 And then one day you wake up and your 26 and you’re applying sunscreen instead of tanning oil.

5366 2018-05-09 15:47:41 Ma’am it’s now the time of making a fresh comment! One US dollar is at 67 against the promise of bringing it down to 40 when Shri @narendramodi ji took over in 2014. Oil prices, wholesale price index, cost of living all northward. Make some noise now
5367 2018-05-09 15:47:40 There’s grai....I mean oil to move. Lol
5368 2018-05-09 15:47:37 Do keep in mind that the CIA has led a worldwide torture regime, aided in the napalming of Vietnamese citizens, and helped overthrow Iran’s liberal democracy in the 50s for cheap oil, creating the mess we have today

Bad as she is, Haspel’s just a continuation of the CIA norms
5369 2018-05-09 15:47:28 The depth of your oil corresponds to the diameter of your egg
5370 2018-05-09 15:47:15 OMG imagine if the baby boxes had oil in them! Mind blown!
5371 2018-05-09 15:47:14 yeah I need some dragons blood oil, I don’t want the soap
5372 2018-05-09 15:47:05 We do not import any major amounts of oil from Iran. They get a lot of theirs from Russia.smh

5376 2018-05-09 15:46:47 Finished 2 great days training with 21 oil and gas engineers. All really engaged and interested in #biodiversity. Excited to think they’ll take what they’ve learnt back to their businesses...
5377 2018-05-09 15:46:46 So what are they peddling now?

Snake Oil?
5378 2018-05-09 15:46:45 True, but the fact that certain new 'close allies' (eg., Saudi, RU) will make mega-bucks off of the rise in oil prices certainly cements the decision to 'pull out' I'm sure.  DT was informed of this benefit (w/ a few indirect donation$ to assist in the decision making).

5382 2018-05-09 15:46:14 Olive oil.
5383 2018-05-09 15:46:11 @GlamLifeGuru I’m in desperate need of a shimmering body oil, but one that is not going to run me $100. Even though I’m DYING for the Tom Ford one.. any suggestions??
5384 2018-05-09 15:46:11 All those trophies bought with oil money 
5385 2018-05-09 15:46:06 Enjoy roasted artichokes this spring. Wrap each in foil with garlic, olive oil, salt and lemon. Bake at 425° for an hour and a half. #CHNeats
5386 2018-05-09 15:46:00 Putin ordered Trump to dump the Iran nuclear deal to pump up oil prices. Russia’s economy is desperate for higher oil prices. In the past month, as it became obvious Trump would dump the deal, oil is already up over 13% breaking $70 a barrel. Plus higher gas prices.
5387 2018-05-09 15:45:52 Yeah well if he plans to put my family and the environment in danger due to the oil pipeline... he and Kinder Morgan can suck it! 
5388 2018-05-09 15:45:43 It’s all for oil and Israel. The cash was Iran’s.
5389 2018-05-09 15:45:43 Yes mate I been to a few games this season when I was able to. 'You been to anfield' what a classic!

Yup and the only reason your piping up these days is because of your oil money and literally nothing else

5393 2018-05-09 15:45:17 Because of the announcement of the #IranDealWithdrawal the oil prices are up. #239PoundOrangeApe who you make wealthier today? How many of your friends are richer? #SmokeScreen #Impeach45

5394 2018-05-09 15:45:12 Pulls into @Valvoline 
Me: I’d like an oil change. 
Attendant: Super duper synthetic? Has unicorn sweat & hero blood in it. Your car will never need an oil change again.
Me: How much?
Attendant: By the looks of your car, you can’t afford it. 
Both: ... Basic oil change it is
5395 2018-05-09 15:44:46 Come pay for my oil change then 
5396 2018-05-09 15:44:42 Haven’t had coconut oil coffee in almost two years and I forgot how much I love it
5397 2018-05-09 15:44:37 Canned Tuna, with chilly pepper and olive oil. 2 minutes top to make.
Some vegetables and you're set
5398 2018-05-09 15:44:25 Every time my phone rings I either have a grease or oil all over my hands 
5399 2018-05-09 15:44:19 How much money did Putin put in his pocket as a result of the spike in oil after yesterday’s announcement Dino?  And where did the payoff go now that Cohen is under scrutiny?
5400 2018-05-09 15:44:15 The World is funny if the Govt finds Oil
in your backyard Its government property but
if they find Weed my friend Its yours alone.
5401 2018-05-09 15:44:14 It’s more like vegetable oil jello
5402 2018-05-09 15:44:06 Donny you are only one tooting your own silly horn, your continued failures are out there LOUD AND CLEAR! Your silly gullible base believes you and that’s ok, there’s always been customers to buy snake oil.
5403 2018-05-09 15:44:04 some quick profit on them oil shares broooo
5404 2018-05-09 15:43:59 I'm thinking Putin lead a chorus of leaders from Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Great Britain, Iran, China and Canada. All of them welcoming higher revenues from multi-national oil corporations that historically profit whenever the status of a major Middle East oil country appears unstable
5405 2018-05-09 15:43:55 How much $ is Dicktard making with leaving the Iran deal? How much oil stock do he & goons have? Bc you know oil prices are fixing to skyrocket..gas prices are already $3.29/gal for premium here, reg $2.99/gal..oil just paid $3.49/gal can u afford more? We can’t

5408 2018-05-09 15:43:28 I was thinking the same thing during the Buhari/Trump meeting, but I am concerned about history repeating itself in regards to oil pollution and transferring of money to private accounts.
5409 2018-05-09 15:43:19 Nice oil rig in the back round matches your pants .
5410 2018-05-09 15:43:14 Just retweeted the same info 

Would have to look it up. I'm afraid (but that's based on personal intuition only) that animal fat may have been substantially replaced by plant oil. Only few Belgians still prepare their fries in beef tallow.
5411 2018-05-09 15:43:11 Sausage, eggs, bacon, cooked apples in honey, cinnamon and butter, plaintains cooked in light olive oil, yogurt with homemade (grain free granola) or honey or fruit.
5412 2018-05-09 15:43:00 I just got my hair done and realised that cornrows are like some people's relationship. It looks good on the outside but you're afraid your edges will leave you like your boo..

That is not my portion! (Puts on castor oil).
5413 2018-05-09 15:42:55 Yup. Arms to Crimea?  Oil exploration. Military buildup. All things Putin wanted.
5414 2018-05-09 15:42:50 Russia state TV celebrating because the price of oil will go up and they benefit, Bigly.
5415 2018-05-09 15:42:48 It's actually worrying how much and loud my bones crack for a 21 year old, get the cod liver oil out
5416 2018-05-09 15:42:33 Fryer oil?
5417 2018-05-09 15:42:20 I'm thinking of getting my fuel oil tank topped off before prices skyrocket. At this rate, it's going to be a cold winter in my house.
5418 2018-05-09 15:42:17 So the immediate effect was a big hike in oil prices. Was your aim to please Putin, or was this a covert strategy to cut fossil fuel use without making your climate-change-deniers base angry?
5419 2018-05-09 15:42:16 褒められてる気がしないし毛には自信ないけど坊主には自信があるよ？？！！！！！！！！！！（？）
5420 2018-05-09 15:42:14 No ‘could’ about it! Gasoline prices are rising. This is the time of year that those using home heating oil negotiate new contracts for next winter and natural gas will go through the roof bc it can! This after the stock market went way down and interest rates went up! Winning?
5421 2018-05-09 15:42:13 Higher oil prices play into Russia's interests, like every other factor in this debacle of a decision.

5424 2018-05-09 15:42:02 I wonder what Iran has that the neocons want.....oh shit.....oil again. uggg.
5425 2018-05-09 15:41:51 Oil; and
5426 2018-05-09 15:41:50 James  5:14  Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:
5427 2018-05-09 15:41:49 Dot-connecting theory currently making rounds: Renewed US sanctions on Iranian oil will push up oil/gasoline prices ahead of US driving season. With an eye on midterms, might Trump (have) cut a deal with the Saudis for them to boost production to offset lost Iranian barrels?
5428 2018-05-09 15:41:48 Thanks for checking in John! We hate to be the bearers of bad news, but our baked line has indeed been discontinued. We do have Sea Salt chips that are 40% reduced fat, as well as our Avocado Oil and Almond Oil chips if you’re interested in trying something new.
5429 2018-05-09 15:41:46 They want oil prices going up. This will get that done.
5430 2018-05-09 15:41:45 With the withdrawal of US govt from IRAN nuclear deal; crude oil price will be up again at int'l market.Lets see what @OfficialAPCNg gov't will  do with their oil boom dividends..! as they always accused @OfficialPDPNig for subjectin Nig to economic woe@GarShehu @zayyadmuhammad
5431 2018-05-09 15:41:41 As a saudi, I mean for real why we need oil and we are the biggest country in the world that have petroleum. That does not make sense. Any evidence? I got no idea about Turkey.
5432 2018-05-09 15:41:34 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
5433 2018-05-09 15:41:34 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
5434 2018-05-09 15:41:23 That's fine, but they'll do it without access to the banking system, the ability to sell oil, and the ability to buy American aircraft.
5435 2018-05-09 15:41:21 that will be the NGO's planted in the country to stir up an uprising -and then install a puppet leader,rape the country, and clear out once you have taken the oil---move along-we have seen it all before. Usually the People praising have an American accent-no matter what country

5437 2018-05-09 15:41:07 that r production rise is a killer.sending a clear message,.... about the economy.. you still not getting it..nobody wants to pay for higher fuel prices even if the gdp/unemployment nos look good
5438 2018-05-09 15:41:05 Nat gas forward prices very weak.  Also costs to drill wells higher.    Realized prices for oil ngl and gas also at discounts to screen prices especially in north east USA.
5439 2018-05-09 15:40:56 All Iran wanted was to stop the British from stealing all their oil. That's how WE got involved...Supporting the British theft.  The Brits were the dishonest party in this, and we knew it. It is partly why the Brits gave Palestine to the European refugee Jews after WW2.
5440 2018-05-09 15:40:54 *notices oil in your plane*
5441 2018-05-09 15:40:52 The olive oil 
5442 2018-05-09 15:40:46 France, Germany, and the UK want to keep the Iran nuclear deal because they can buy cheaper oil from Iran than from Saudi Arabia or the United States. If Iran, however continues to enrich uranium and deny inspectors access to its sites, the United States may use military force.

5452 2018-05-09 15:40:26 I love the amazing things tea tree oil does for my skin but my lanta, could it possibly smell any worse?!
5453 2018-05-09 15:40:26 Our primary source of oil was Saudi Arabia, not Iran.  We did not hold companies in Iran like ARAMCO in Saudi.  We cared because the usurping PM was trying to establish a brutal dictatorship that would have to go Soviet in order to survive.

5457 2018-05-09 15:40:13 Our withdrawal from this deal lets Israel attack Iran and when Iran retaliates we can invade for their oil..I mean protect the Jews.

5462 2018-05-09 15:39:50 We are going to pay regardless. All the politicians in this province are garbage and owned by big oil. None of you give a shit about taxpayers.
5463 2018-05-09 15:39:35 wow wow these people burning the midnight oil ka apa
5464 2018-05-09 15:39:35 I've done 1 A3 painting, 1 coloured pencil drawing, 2 A3 oil pastel drawings, and 2 A4 oil pastel drawings.
5465 2018-05-09 15:39:34 of course i deserve this rose hip oil on my face after that freaking embassy thing 
5466 2018-05-09 15:39:26 I need to go get a protein treatment, tea tree oil and Jamaican black castor oil. On Friday or I’m gonna die!
5467 2018-05-09 15:39:25 Just bring the baby oil over and shut up 
5468 2018-05-09 15:39:23 Agreed.

5469 2018-05-09 15:39:16 This recent rise in oil prices is a good test of the Poloz "rising oil prices are unambiguously positive for Canada" claim.

This has: 

-given CAD a bid
-not alleviated transportation bottlenecks
-not been a meaningful delta for investment, I would think
5470 2018-05-09 15:39:13 The simulator used hydraulic oil under pressure for the pistons that drive the movement. That oil is under a constant pressure with a minimum pressure all the time or the simulator shuts down. That "moment" was story based.
5471 2018-05-09 15:39:04 Saudi Arabia=largest middle eastern exporter of US oil, and Israel is a strong military ally and considered Holy Land by Christians....duh.
5472 2018-05-09 15:38:54 Number one, this will help increase the price of oil because supply will go down. This will help all of Trump and Pence’s donors/masters and screw the middle class. Number two, it was an Obama agreement.

5474 2018-05-09 15:38:13 Finally, this cycle has been mired by distortions in the import price deflator due to wild swings in oil. Oil prices up, deflator up, real imports down, vice versa with lower oil prices.

5476 2018-05-09 15:37:57 The NEB determines the allocation. They use "historic usage" as their guiding priniple but in the "national interest" they could easily change that for the good of the population.

It's our oil, after all. Shipping more refined products, refined in Canada, should be the goal.

5482 2018-05-09 15:37:09 A reason Cramer gave for his support of Trumps withdrawal from the Iranian agreement was that it was good for US oil companies.
5483 2018-05-09 15:37:02 No but seriously... why don’t we have renewable energy? Why aren’t we recycling? Why are we still relying on fossil fuels? Wtf is going on with the govt. trying to drill. In our waters? What for? So we can have an oil spill like we’ve seen the world over?
5484 2018-05-09 15:37:00 This is right wing claptrap from a person that is likely supported by American dollars.  Pure bullshit to maintain the repression of a plant that can do things that big pharma dreams they could. And its cousin, hemp, makes better rope, fabric, plastic, paper and can replace oil

5487 2018-05-09 15:36:29 I have a serious problem with relaxing regulations only to have the oil companies gouge the public instead of benefit us with lower prices.
5488 2018-05-09 15:36:17 Mercedes could help pay for the oil spills, like in Nigeria just to name one. Put that on the car.

5495 2018-05-09 15:35:34 Trump must think again,if he thinks the US will just do as please with the lives of Iranians just bcuz they plenty of oil
5496 2018-05-09 15:35:33 Not to mention the straight up lie that energy east would have increased energy independence. Every oil refiner clearly stated several times that they were not going to convert to tar oil.
5497 2018-05-09 15:35:32 I did think about it. Why is John Kerry aiding and abetting a state sponsor of terror?  Does his family have business there?  Is it about a direct payoff or favorable climate for him in Iran. Is he protecting Iranian oil exploitation?  Paris accord?

5500 2018-05-09 15:35:30 9 for yields. 1 for oil. Net neutral.
5501 2018-05-09 15:35:12 However, if the rest of the world lessens sanctions and allows the sale of Iranian oil, Putin's ploy fails. I doubt if 45 would go to war with US allies  over that.
5502 2018-05-09 15:35:07 Oil prices have to be part of the calculus. Another uncanny example where everything about withdrawing plays into Russia's hands. Trump has been totally captured by his real estate financiers, apartment buyers, and money launderers.

5514 2018-05-09 15:34:09 Oil prices are going up. So much for your tax cut and the great benefit it is supposed to have on our economy. We will be lucky to break even. Your trade war with China is costing our farmers as well. You need to listen to your advisors. Not you campaign rhetoric.

5516 2018-05-09 15:33:57 The USA has ALWAYS treated them deplorably since we overthrew their democracy in the fifties and imposed the Shah just to please an oil company. Obama was the first to show some integrity toward Iran.
5517 2018-05-09 15:33:56 This is a rather week argument especially now that the oil price has risen significantly. Short-termism isn't the best argument against independence but feel free to keep flogging that dead horse.

5520 2018-05-09 15:33:45 Something to note on the Iran deal, Iran was selling their oil on the black market, Obama later found out the proceeds were funding terrorism. The Nuclear Deal required Iran to be transparent in all exporting of commodities. This essentially allows them to fund terrorism. Again.

5530 2018-05-09 15:32:54 Putin needs higher oil prices to keep himself in power.  
Trump always repays favors.
Enjoy higher gas prices.
5531 2018-05-09 15:32:52 I bet Russia is really upset at soaring oil prices in the wake of Trump cancelling the Iran deal.
5532 2018-05-09 15:32:44 This will cost even the Trumpians. Pruitt has decimated the new energy that has been competition for oil. There’s nothing to force oil prices down.

5534 2018-05-09 15:32:28 Trump needed to take USA out of the Iran deal because the world at large was watching the sanctions on Russia. His hands were tied and because Putin has so much dirt criminally on him. He did this deal opening up an entry for Russia to sell its oil.

5546 2018-05-09 15:31:07 Yup. I said this a year ago. Who benefits from an Iran/U.S. war? *Cui bono?* Well, Russia for one, as their oil prices will enjoy massive increases. Meanwhile, we can look forward to gas at $5 or more per gallon here in the U.S.
5547 2018-05-09 15:31:03 How many oil wells and coal mines do you own? Go on making people rich ... They've earned it for all these great things they did. Melting the Arctic polluting the planet. We'd be far better of if we skipped fossil age

5550 2018-05-09 15:30:55 no other president would be putting russian interests so front and center. oil prices up. split between historic allies in Western Europe and USA. chaos generally. Russia doesnt impose sanctions - freely trades with Iran. good deal for them.

5559 2018-05-09 15:30:27 Very true very true..and before the Iran nuclear deal was put into effect it was Russia who benefited from the original Iranian santions set by America they traded weapons and technology for oil and Russia got richer everything being hated and losing allies to war trump for Putin

if big oil was truly worried about RVP, remove waiver for all fuels.  (that would be costly to them).
5566 2018-05-09 15:29:35 Palm oil isn’t even a vegan problem, it’s a environmental problem plus all the palm oil I consume is costarican which is way more ethical than that that comes from Malaysia and Indonesia and I don’t even eat oreos so

5574 2018-05-09 15:28:45 agreed.  Strong dollar with higher rates and high oil is a bad combo for Turkey for example.   

and for Argentina, substitute bad soybean harvest for high oil

5581 2018-05-09 15:28:14 Now @michaelsantoli botched the $XLE vs. oil price analysis. 
Both are $70+ now but when oil collapsed to $27, XLE never went below $50, $48.

5583 2018-05-09 15:28:08 There was never an American oil company in Iran.  What does that tell you about your source?

5585 2018-05-09 15:28:02 A big part of their deal included the procurement of oil from Iran.  With the deal withdrawn, it opens up a big chunk of the industry to other OPEC countries...I don’t think it was a coincidence that Buhari met with Trump right before this decision.

5591 2018-05-09 15:27:11 An increase in oil price by $10/bbl would bring down GDP growth by 0.2% - 0.3% point, quicken inflation by 1.7% points, and worsen Curr a/c balance by ~$9 - 10bn of India.

5592 2018-05-09 15:27:02 @TheView @MeghanMcCain is too young.What's wrong with @JoyVBehar?Iran took hostages.We froze $3.4billion from oil purchase.Iran since paid $millions&settled with hostages&families.Sanctions were about to be voted against US by UN if didn't unfreeze.Settled for $1.7B&nuclear deal.

5600 2018-05-09 15:26:16 84,000 bpd more oil from the US this week. Wow. Bearish. At that rate, end of June/first week of July gets us at 11k. About the economy, it's not that oil wont fall. A better economy (which we have) might limit is damage. A good part of globe growth was the weaker GBP and Euro.

5604 2018-05-09 15:25:55 Sanction them ? Hell no! He's going to raise the oil prices so the Russians can balance their budget. He's going to destroy the solar and environmental industry and remove regulations on car makers so they can consume more gas, raise those oil prices for Papa Putin.
5605 2018-05-09 15:25:42 Less than 24 hours after @realDonaldTrump announcement, oil has surged, with oil prices at $70 a barrel. #oil

5607 2018-05-09 15:25:34 Over the last few years. There is still work record oil production with a glut of oil sitting in tankers if I understand correctly. Even POTUS remarked recently there is no reason why pump prices should be rising. What do you think?
5608 2018-05-09 15:25:20 The military is fighting for corporate establishment & natural resources(oil, lithium, opium) War is a profit motiv, not a moral one. None of the 8 countries we're bombing have attacked us, None.
5609 2018-05-09 15:25:16 It's not a "wild fantasy" to think that we could be spending our tax dollars on things besides the military and oil industry subsidies

5612 2018-05-09 15:25:00 Even the former head of #PDVSA agrees that the state run oil company is managed terribly: “The lack of knowledge and experience among the top oil men in #Venezuela, together with infighting within the oil circles, has led to PDVSA’s plunging production.” @RRamirezVE @zerohedge

Let me answer
1. Saudi Arabia
2. Arab Emirates

What is the commonality. Oil and its price movement up.
Trump has paid back all his friends.

5620 2018-05-09 15:24:30 Does the olive oil that comes out of the vat of orzo at the greek count as a condiment?
5621 2018-05-09 15:24:23 Exactly, because oil will run out eventually, so , "Big Money" wants to Grab as much of it as possible, making us run out even sooner than Expected,---
causing the Competition to drasticly raise the prices At The PUMP !!
5622 2018-05-09 15:24:05 You can say whatever you want this move was completely unnecessary and won't help anything in fact almost certainly it will do the exact opposite- the only people on earth that didn't want this was GOP politicians pad by oil corporations with good reason, notice fuel prices latly
5623 2018-05-09 15:24:04 Well, at least we'll get our oil from Russia now, so more trump 'winning'.

5626 2018-05-09 15:23:36 does that mean you made promises to the oil companies to make their PROFITS soar? by NOT doing the Iran deal you have raised the price of gas for the American people. that will wipe out the tax cuts for them!
5627 2018-05-09 15:23:35 What Trump's Iran decision means for oil and gas prices
#DumbAssTrump has just raised the price for oil & gas & he doesn't give a shit
5628 2018-05-09 15:23:22 At some friends house last night and the wife was making fun of me because I call her when I think she needs to fill up or hold off (gas) because of the price of #oil #TradersLife

5630 2018-05-09 15:23:14 I think you are correct Andrew in your assessment. If, however, POTUS makes quick work of Iran like he did with NK, Iran oil will be back on the table well before mid-term. (You and I both know that the oil folks will take advantage of anything to help recoup their losses
5631 2018-05-09 15:23:10 brilliant, way outside of the president's limited mental capacity. Putin wins again, and along with The Saudis make much needed oil revenue, the average US citizen pays higher gas prices putting an increased strain on a fragile economy, and our children will pay with their blood

5636 2018-05-09 15:22:46 "number crunchers" have probably already thought through this:
-that "hit" is still less than the "appeal" of war: arms,oil,geostrategic,etc
-Boeing will make a TON$$ from a war
-duopoly is running at full tilt already
-they will just ship later once Iran has "changed management"

5647 2018-05-09 15:22:03 Wow, what a breakthrough. Nobel Prize material for sure. Meanwhile, Putin's oil just got much more valuable, we've conceded the middle east to Russia and Iran, and gas went up $.30/gallon overnight. All with a stroke of that orange idiot's pen.
5648 2018-05-09 15:22:00 Problem is that CO2 comes with terrible side effects. NO2 SO2 Oil pests etc.
5649 2018-05-09 15:21:28 Fair -- but I think here the rhetoric matters. Americans need to confront the tradeoff from lowering drug prices. We don't need more snake oil charlatans promising lower prices and more awesome new drugs. Twitter has enough of those (though to be clear @MattAFiedler is not one)
5650 2018-05-09 15:21:13 China is allowing oil to go do that.
5651 2018-05-09 15:21:04 Gas goes up every summer, it's frustrating. At one time, gas was closer to 5.00 a gallon here, since Trump the highest is about 3.00 a gallon. I still dont like it, but we are soon going to be the largest oil producers in the world, and that should help with long term stability

5656 2018-05-09 15:20:42 Then doubled back on Iran for restructuring. The second problem is the Midterms. Trump is playing our "Domestic Politics" on a world stage . He just Russian rouletted our children's future all for the sake of midterms and oppression of that Iranian oil/natural gas.

5662 2018-05-09 15:20:19 I work in the O&G sector.  I said in 2014 when the crash started that the price would rebound past its $110bbl it hit in mid-2013.

People scoffed and said, no way thats it for the oil industry - its done!

People are generally ignorant to how supply and demand works!

5664 2018-05-09 15:19:58 Well if that’s the case then Pres. Trump should remove the legal standing of the environmentalists that has prevented the creation of new oil refineries in America for the last several decades.
5665 2018-05-09 15:19:54 So is backing out of the Iran deal really just one more way to make tons of cash for his oil and gas cronies??

5667 2018-05-09 15:19:47 There are already very liquid alternatives to the dollar that do have reserve status (GBP, EUR, JPY). CNY is definitely travelling in the right direction (and CNY oil is a catalyst), but its got some way to go before it can credibly compete with above trio. That's the crux of it.

5674 2018-05-09 15:19:10 Trump pulling out of the Iran deal is actually good for Nigeria and all other oil producing countries....I still remember when Iran refused to reduce production when OPEC countries asked them to...helping the US n co drive the oil prices down with introduction of Shale.

5677 2018-05-09 15:18:39 Understand the only people against the Iran Deal are US oil companies which will profit from the supply of oil not recieved from Iran. Which means gas prices go up and oil companies get richer all while the world slowly burns

5681 2018-05-09 15:18:22 Just an idea but instead of looking for another fossil fuel source to reduce fuel poverty (which hasn't fallen since the '70's oil boom) how about we make houses more energy efficient and reduce fuel use.

5687 2018-05-09 15:18:07 (1/2) Then we go long at that pit when the idiots are crying doomsday. One thing we may be overlooking though. Back in 2008 and 2014, we saw weak overall economic periods (2008 everywhere, and 2014 in China). The economy is much stronger than those years. Macro #s look good.

5704 2018-05-09 15:16:46 That is the Dems have a globalist agenda. Iran deal is written by globalists.  In 2015 Iran dumped the dollar & began settling oil in Euros. Recently, in April, Iran further dumped the dollar & made the Euro their official reporting currency. Small wonder why the EU backs Iran!

5715 2018-05-09 15:15:42 Today, I give a FREE talk on essential oil safety to Cancer Support Community!
5716 2018-05-09 15:15:41 $WTI $OIL Free trail to hit $101 dollars.
5717 2018-05-09 15:15:34 I have lemon eucalyptus oil in my diffuser and Collin keeps telling me how much he loves it because it smells like an ant hill...
5718 2018-05-09 15:15:31 Word is that Putin approved; oil prices will go up and that’s really all that matters, right?
5719 2018-05-09 15:15:22 Wait till he discovers that Obama approved of  electric lights in the White House. Candles and coal oil lanterns will make a big comeback.
5720 2018-05-09 15:15:13 Isn’t there burning oil in La Juive? And what about the jump into the volcano in the opera in Great Scott? Or Carlo killing his beloved in I Masnadieri?
5721 2018-05-09 15:15:10 Boil noodles, drain & wash in cold water. In oil, fry all the veggies you want/have, ginger/garlic, add fish sauce, soy sauce, chilli flakes & add noodles, salt, MSG & crushed roasted peanuts. Squeeze lime. If you have Thai basil & galangal (Thai style ginger) that’s good too
5722 2018-05-09 15:14:53 Bio Oil ini ada versi lotionnya aja ga sih?
5723 2018-05-09 15:14:48 So South Australia is your model then. Highest energy prices but oh so good with no fracking allowed. I wonder if our friend can tell us the difference between conventional oil and gas recovery and fracking.
5724 2018-05-09 15:14:46 Kale chips though

Oil, chilli, bit o salt and bake the fuckers
5725 2018-05-09 15:14:41 Christ, "our meddling" that had Iran calm and friendly for 30 years until OPEC shorted the oil market and Iran made so much money it collapsed their economy.
And who ran OPEC again?

Neophyte.
5726 2018-05-09 15:14:36 Why the pictures clicked by the camera seems like oil painted when zoomed in.
@OnePlus_Support
5727 2018-05-09 15:14:31 pretty normal
1)Iran,we got all 'info' now. So it's over
2)interest rates steady.Ok, high, BUT, never doubt a bullish argument
3)oil, a touch up, but forget that
4)EM in a bit of hot soup. But they always serve their soup spicy/hot
5)turbulence in Middle East, prob a sand storm
5728 2018-05-09 15:14:27 It was just a gut feeling based on the situation. Of course the elephant warned me of how SA manipulates back in February. Without his guidance, I'd be stuck here looking like a dumbass.

5730 2018-05-09 15:14:16 Why oil states will be more than happy to increase production and lower prices because none of their budgets is dependent on oil price
5731 2018-05-09 15:14:04 Scotland, where oil is a burden and baby boxes are abhorrent.
5732 2018-05-09 15:14:01 Bobcat Kittens sounds like the name of a tough but lovable old oil man whose grandkids convince him to stop his oil business and switch to solar panels in a Disney cartoon.
5733 2018-05-09 15:13:51 True, but if I remember correctly gas was around 53.9 cents a litre early 2000s, oil was $40 a barrel, Canadian $ was around 70 cents compared with U.S. $.
5734 2018-05-09 15:13:51 Not that forward thinking. Instead he's listening to others to pull out BC: oil prices go up for Russia & Saudi Arabia, Israel's hawkish wing can increase aggression, Trump's base gets to destroy another Bush/Obama achievement, and @realDonaldTrump gets another "Putin Pettin' ".
5735 2018-05-09 15:13:46 Go away.   Obama created so many regulations that thousands of people in the oil sector lost jobs.  If we were allowed to drill off California, Florida, east coast and ANWR, We could be energy independent.  cali should not complain.
5736 2018-05-09 15:13:44 It can't be more wrong to put harsher sanction towards the fifth largest oil producer for in the world considering that US economy depends on it.  #AJNewsGrid
5737 2018-05-09 15:13:42 I was reading about the cannaboid oil that does not contain the THC psychoactive part of the pot, sounds promising! -and hi!

5739 2018-05-09 15:13:42 The ayatollahs will sell their massive stockpile of oil on the black market & reap the higher prices while pursuing their Nuclear program in secret.  

The only deterrence is engagement.  Sanctions will hurt the people not the ayatollahs & their Swiss bank accounts.  

5740 2018-05-09 15:13:41 Imagine slapping oil on somebody ashy ass forehead like a pastor trying to make somebody fall out during altar call
5741 2018-05-09 15:13:37 BWAA-HA-HA  Where's your outrage that Biden's son got $ BIL from Ukraine govt & VP of Ukraine oil co? While Obama/Biden in office!
5742 2018-05-09 15:13:28 Limited options for women so wouldn't go too far back.  Try to do something about climate change earlier by messing with the oil companies knowing what I know now I guess, or try to make Kennedy take Nixon's offer of 'medicare for all'.
5743 2018-05-09 15:13:26 I might be retarded but I think oil might be a sell....
5744 2018-05-09 15:13:14 Janet Zabilski returns to the Beacon Hill Art Walk this year with her oil and pastel paints of portraiture and landscape scenes.
5745 2018-05-09 15:13:13 URGENT: Trump and Interior Secretary Zinke are rushing to open the Arctic Refuge to oil and gas drilling. Act now and stand up against any move to open the Arctic Refuge to Big Polluters!
5746 2018-05-09 15:13:11 It also makes it easier for China to step in and normalize relations with the country that has the 4th largest oil reserves.  And China doesn't give a shit about Democracy or human rights.
5747 2018-05-09 15:13:10 9/11 was premeditated by USA business to infiltrate the middle east for oil reserves.
5748 2018-05-09 15:13:09 If that was a great deal....then I've got this wonderful snake oil for sale over here....
5749 2018-05-09 15:13:03 i gotta get coconut oil so i can fry these plantain's 
5750 2018-05-09 15:13:01 No freaks, counts me out then,
I will just imagine it, whilst eating pineapples and coconut oil.
5751 2018-05-09 15:12:59 No, just threw up two warnings. 'Check tyre pressure and reset runflat indicator', and 'ESP is off' ( probably because it was a rear tyre and it's RWD) otherwise i love the old girl. Pokey for an oil burner.
5752 2018-05-09 15:12:58 you were right about the imports..I missed that:)

5754 2018-05-09 15:12:27 This is true and also in general not worth it IMO.

Keep an oil rag around if you keep going. No point in gambling if you got enough oil on the pan

5756 2018-05-09 15:12:13 The oil lady don’t count
5757 2018-05-09 15:12:09 My nigga, I came for an oil change. Don’t tell me all this other shit lol
5758 2018-05-09 15:12:07 The importance of a multinational coalition working towards democracy in Iran, who has the 4th largest oil reserves in the world, cannot be ignored.  

If we don't pursue moving Iran towards being the type of country we can have normal relations with then China will step in.
5759 2018-05-09 15:11:46 That’s a pretty horrifying thought! Jumping from a frying pan of burning oil into the fire of eternal hell.
5760 2018-05-09 15:11:44 Of course it was the plan he campaigned on it. The question is whether or not he is prepared to go to war? Second question are we prepared to make the Middle East a spot that glows in the dark? That’s what it will take and then where is oil?
5761 2018-05-09 15:11:42 even refineries will scale back at higher prices..the market is speculating on the very short term ..but when it turns to look at long term scenarios..it will hard for anybody to fight that..that's what happened in 2008, 2014..then oil descends in a bottomless pit.
5762 2018-05-09 15:11:36 Yep - Rick Scott solved a lot of problems: 1. How to kill poor people with no Medicaid Expansion 2. Killing Seniors by not answering his phone 3. Saving Florida’s Everglades by drilling for oil there 4. Showing us how nice our canals and beaches look  covered in green algae
5763 2018-05-09 15:11:30 @TheView We released frozen Iranian monies back to them. If you are concerned with them funding terrorism then support alternative fuels and stop buying Iranian oil.

5766 2018-05-09 15:11:13 Yeah the oil base is interesting. I've got some American Crew that is water based that I like, but it is definitely more shiney. Not a bad thing though. I'm actually surprised that my hair isn't a greasy mess at the end of the day when I run my fingers through.

5769 2018-05-09 15:11:09 I suppose skyrocketing oil prices will help Alaska, but for most consumers, will negate any benefit of tax cut. Maybe you should have asked for the “plan” before giving your support.

5789 2018-05-09 15:09:20 US production now less than 300k from overtaking Russia as world's #1 oil producer. Also factor in new EPA waiver for refineries (haven't followed closely, can't speak much to it), expect builds within 2 weeks again
5790 2018-05-09 15:09:17 ESP has been fine up to now, apart from shutting down when I had a very slow tyre leak. Oil cooler and replacement ballast controller for the xenon headlamp have been my costliest issues. Oh and the passenger window winding mechanism just went titsup

5804 2018-05-09 15:08:14 we dont even get much oil from iran, mostly comes from south america and canada
5805 2018-05-09 15:08:09 we know that coal and coke is almost gone, technically it should be banned from consumers... Oil and Gas by mid century?
5806 2018-05-09 15:08:09 So @realDonaldTrump is pulling out from Iran Deal when the country was the world’s fifth greatest oil producer in 2017, when the OPEC and Saudi Arabia cut its oil production, and when Venezuela fails to produce optimal oil due to political upheaval. Enjoy expensive oil, Trump!
5807 2018-05-09 15:07:56 France, Britain, Germany, Russia, China and Iran will be WINNERs and USA will be isolated.... They all will be selling cheaper OIL than USA... Eventhough we are looking into alternatives to OIL, OIL is still the king of all Fuel source. #irandeal,#oilprice, #BlueWave2018
5808 2018-05-09 15:07:45 Little late. It has been sunny in California for quite a few years and it is one of the countries that would be seriously hit by rising waters. Also has major oil exploitation in the south that could partially be replaced by electric production.
5809 2018-05-09 15:07:36 No you are not wrong..what you/market overlooking is US production..it is on its way to 11 million b/d and eventually 12 million b/d..thats a monster he cannot fight... And as expected US exports scaled back at higher prices.

5813 2018-05-09 15:07:04 Before many months have passed you will read that Russia, Iran and China will no longer trade Oil priced in US$.
5814 2018-05-09 15:07:03 You can't rely on oil, if you want to have a stable economy. No we aren't, we don't have the means to do that. You can't just assume that we can, Economics is numbers,math, cost-benefit analysis and statistics. We work with emperical data, we use math to reach conclusions.

5823 2018-05-09 15:05:40 How many trillions of taxpayer dollars have Republicans spent protecting oil billionaire tycoons expansions in foreign countries and status quo. Look at all the people that have suffered and died we should be moving to renewable energies and stop creating conflicts abroad.
5824 2018-05-09 15:05:28 I think the oil ETF's are fine if the futures remain in backwardation, but not so good in opposite, and have to think but this might be opposite for  the short funds

5827 2018-05-09 15:05:10 I would rather have higher gas prices than pay for oil from a country that that hates us and wants to kill us.
5828 2018-05-09 15:05:04 I knew it. The Saudis strike again.
5829 2018-05-09 15:04:47 Why can't anybody just say that REPUBLICANS WANT TO GO TO WAR FOR OIL. We all know Republicans work for oil companies and keep pulling this bs every time they come into power. Not buying the 'ignorance' story anymore. That just enables.
5830 2018-05-09 15:04:43 Sanctions & Oil is all the tRump presidency is about  oh and MONEY
5831 2018-05-09 15:04:38 They depend on Iran for oil & gas.

5833 2018-05-09 15:04:29 Yes Iranians are all uber rich with the trillions of dollars given by USA. I can't believe you brag about aides and donations. What a sick mentality. Instead Iran would have preferred lifting sanctions on it's economy so the oil rich country would grow a trillion dollar economy

5846 2018-05-09 15:02:55 I don't pretend to be as expert on this topic as others, but I've argued for over a year that, in order to make a HUGE difference, this oil/CNY contract only needed to provide a way for US-defined "pariah" nations to evade US sanctions. The teeth of USD hegemony have been pulled.
5847 2018-05-09 15:02:53 this is so direct billy just slap some baby oil on her

5853 2018-05-09 15:02:24 Trudeau did a good job of eliminating billions of dollars in the oil industry when he shut down already approved peipelines and has put more regulations on the ONE he claims to stand behind, so yes Trudeau can shut down industries, and hurt the economy, he has already done so

5856 2018-05-09 15:02:07 Thanks for your patience while we've looked into this! The Problem solution toner contains white willow bark and tea tree oil which are natural sources of salicylic acid.

5861 2018-05-09 15:01:44 @Maddow
So, with @therealdonaldtrump pulling out of the #IranDeal, will Russia now be allowed to make the deal with Rex Tillerson for oil drilling in Russia?
5862 2018-05-09 15:01:43 @lameberIy told me to use vitamin c oil!
5863 2018-05-09 15:01:41 Ms. Warren, take a trip down to the US patent office and you will see NUMEROUS patent seizures of clean renewable energy inventions. We could have gone off oil LONG AGO. Be one of the few who had the guts to check it out.
5864 2018-05-09 15:01:40 How do you get chainsaw oil stains off underwear? Asking for a friend.
5865 2018-05-09 15:01:34 I guess the big question then is how long is he willing to keep exporting less? Assuming prices continue to rise then he could stick to that plan longer than we'd like. Am I overlooking something?
5866 2018-05-09 15:01:31 We were never interested in Iran's oil.  You are thinking of the British.  And we didn't "put in" a dictator.  Iran was ruled by monarchy continuously for 2500 years before the revolution. Do you actually know history or are you just spewing whatever sounds right to you?
5867 2018-05-09 15:01:30 เหนื่อยแทนพี่อ่ะ
5868 2018-05-09 15:01:24 Just for the record,  Saudi Arabia is a far greater sponsor of terrorism than Iran.  AND Iran was abiding by the treaty.  

Again, this is about making more $ for the Russians and #ComplicitGOP by driving up oil prices.
5869 2018-05-09 15:01:20 Transports shooting higher with oil the last few days because markets don’t have to make sense.
5870 2018-05-09 15:01:18 ditto 

..ironically HUR is still nowhere near its earlier highs even though the oil price is up 40%,Lancaster EPS on/ahead of target...and first oil only c. 6mths away, plenty of upside here for years to come imho
5871 2018-05-09 15:01:12 Uff okay dann fällt mir sonst nur Tamanu Oil ein, oder Laser wie du schon sagtest. 
Ist das 30% Peeling gut? überlege mir das beim nächsten mal zu holen
5872 2018-05-09 15:01:08 I hate getting oil changes
5873 2018-05-09 15:01:01 Market is trying to act like rising oil prices, rising interest rates, a slowing economy, a Fed rate hiking cycle and Fed balance sheet unwind are bullish
5874 2018-05-09 15:00:45 Believe what you'd like, but ask yourself why Iran's two greatest enemies in the world, who are more worried about their safety than the price of oil, opposed the agreement so vigorously if it prevented them from developing nuclear weapons?

5881 2018-05-09 15:00:22 お、よい子はハンターさんに任せて寝る時間だぞ！
5882 2018-05-09 15:00:06 Trade war?  I have worked my whole career in import/export... no one is trading with Iran. In fact @CBP uses Iran trading examples in all of their compliance scare examples!  If your argument is referencing oil, the U.S. can ramp up its own production and destabilize OPEC.
5883 2018-05-09 15:00:06 Today's pizza has crushed tomato, onion, mozzarella and cheddar cheese; garnished with garlic olive oil, parsley and oregano
5884 2018-05-09 15:00:05 作曲で意識されてるであろう「懐かしさ」的な概念を俺らは知らないんだろうけど、それを「懐かしい」って感じるところが凄いと思うんですよね(早口)
5885 2018-05-09 15:00:03 Pulang tadi rencananya mau ambil lipbalm sama sheetmask. Yg diambil malah Son n Park, Natrep, hair tonic, make up remover sama olive oil. 
5886 2018-05-09 14:59:49 I do have CDB oil it works. I appreciate prayers this is driven by mental anxiety and I’m not doing well thank you
5887 2018-05-09 14:59:47 It depends. Good hair care is less expensive & less complicated than you think. Water, oil(s),  conditioner, protective styling, good nutrition. The rest is extra to conform for others' delicate sensibilities. Weaves are a conformity we've adopted.  Still, I hear you.
5888 2018-05-09 14:59:47 Need olive oil for ekerk? Just contact @nutaella95 xD free tang product free tang shipping
5889 2018-05-09 14:59:45 I wonder if he is trying to get sanctions on Iran to try to take over their market share, I doubt that stretch will work either. It’s crazy how much  $$ KSA is missing out on with their cuts
5890 2018-05-09 14:59:38 Thank God for my dad cause i would’ve gotten to the dealership (for my oil change tomorrow) and they would’ve tried to overcharge me
5891 2018-05-09 14:59:36 Agreed, it's a disgrace. I needed to get to Eurocarparts on the A444, realised there was no way to get there if not in a car. I'd already drained the oil before I realised they'd given me the wrong stuff to refill it so couldn't drive!
5892 2018-05-09 14:59:31 El oil si el grafico no me falla va a estar cerca de los u$s110 que no lo lea esto aranguren porque va a cargar la 9mm. El viento en contra es muy fuerte
5893 2018-05-09 14:59:30 J'aime une vidéo @YouTube : "See What Happens To Your Body When You Start Taking Fish Oil Everyday" à l'adresse
5894 2018-05-09 14:59:28 Yes indeed, we sat him down and talked it through properly, it must be respected, tried CBD oil first with some success but then a trip to Amsterdam changed everything, the right combination THC to Cbd was like a holy miracle for him, he still has bad days but has his life back
5895 2018-05-09 14:59:18 Oil in rally mode as the perfect storm in the Middle East. Iran and Saudi ramping up hostilities. #IranNuclearDeal is over. US shale producers sitting pretty and can pump 24/7 now and make money. $xle $eog
5896 2018-05-09 14:59:17 I remember what happened to Boeing during the Iran oil embargo during the 70s it wasn't pretty
5897 2018-05-09 14:59:16 To be fair, if another country forced me to live under a monarchy, stole my oil, and sold my neighbor chemical weapons I'd be pretty pissed
5898 2018-05-09 14:59:13 Nope. It’s the fetzer valve the fell from the plane fletch worked on. Ball bearings and some 30 weight oil will get it back into shape!
5899 2018-05-09 14:59:01 If you have no interest in US foreign policy or why you should , oil prices have rocketed up and so will your petrol and heating bills.
5900 2018-05-09 14:58:56 Wtf.  I have been getting an oil change for an hour and a half....
5901 2018-05-09 14:58:44 I think sending our kids to fight for oil is mean-spirited. We’ll have to disagree.
5902 2018-05-09 14:58:18 Record national debt, record consumer debt, record student loan debt, rental $ soaring, gas $ up, oil going $100/bbl, food $ soaring, wages stagnant, healthcare $ soaring, insurance $ climbing every year... If that's ur idea of a strong economy u are dumber than u look.
5903 2018-05-09 14:58:18 You didn't protect shit. Iraq was not a threat. The US invaded to steal Iraq's oil it had nothing to do with security.
5904 2018-05-09 14:58:14 I do believe that President Trump isn't a Christian anymore, that would explain his extreme loyalty to zionist leadership, a leadership who have been openly dealing oil with Takfiri militants during the occupation of Syria and Iraq
5905 2018-05-09 14:58:09 Who wanted this deal broken: PUTIN to sell oil & undermine the US alliances, Saudi Arabia in exchange for Jared’s Billion, Israel hoping to drag US into War with Iran
#TrumpsDegradesAmericaAlliances
5906 2018-05-09 14:58:06 There is "The 21st century is the century of oil and he who owns the satellite belt owns the 21st century." That was the basic scenario put forward by the "New American Century" think tank 4 the Rumsfeld Cheney White House. Guess it hasn't filtered down to top Trump turtles yet.
5907 2018-05-09 14:58:05 Corporate tax breaks for large industries are largely to blame for years of budget cuts to K-12 education, in Oklahoma and Arizona. a tax break used by oil & gas companies in OK is responsible for bleeding the state of more than $1 billion over 3-yrs #txlege #TaxScam
5908 2018-05-09 14:57:58 I need a nice hot oil full body rub down

แต่ยังทำไม่ถึงไหนเลยอห
5914 2018-05-09 14:57:39 @TradersCom @ThePitBoss16 oil cant figure out what the F to do
5915 2018-05-09 14:57:37 And how about them oil prices today.  Red States? Anything?  Midwest Farmers? How much of your crops are you selling to China?  All this Winning!
5916 2018-05-09 14:57:37 @realDonaldTrump I am sure our team working on getting our allies in OPEC to keep oil prices lower as Iran deal pullout implemented. Low oil prices mean less cash for Russia & Iran to promote mid east instability.
5917 2018-05-09 14:57:31 according to Brett Wilson you are incorrect about coal exports being down as he has a booming bussiness,Trudeau tells people at world conferrences that he wishes he could shut down the oil industry now, he never seems to mention the coal industry as part of his cleaner agenda
5918 2018-05-09 14:57:31 ขอบคุณค่าาาาา
5919 2018-05-09 14:57:27 I am disappointed that Mr. Trump draw back. It is only because of money. By this the oil price increase and Saudi and US and other will be more rich. By the decision of Mr. Trump the world goes more unstable. It is the most wrong decision. I don't agree with the president.
5920 2018-05-09 14:57:26 I’ve just discovered you can use coconut oil as highlighter, is there anything concoct oil can’t do?!
5921 2018-05-09 14:57:26 Hai Bro Anthon, AHM Oil kini memiliki kemasan botol yang lebih modern dan lebih mudah digenggam, serta dibalut dengan stiker yang terlihat lebih modern sehingga memberikan kesan dinamis. Untk kemasan AHM Oil MPX-1 terbaru adlh sesuai dgn gambar yg kami (cont) -
5922 2018-05-09 14:57:23 Culprit: Too much sugar

Why it’s bad: Produces excess oil which will lead to oily skin

Solution: Have a more balanced diet

Culprit: Changing beauty products frequently

Why it’s bad: Throws of skins pH

Solution: Wait 3 weeks before trying something new
5923 2018-05-09 14:57:11 Lol. Be careful around splashing hot oil.
5924 2018-05-09 14:56:49 Is Oil going to break out, or just test the top of the range all summer? lol
5925 2018-05-09 14:56:49 For the crime of selling out Michigan voters to a Canadian oil giant, the day after I am inaugurated, every single member still in good standing @michamber can expect to be inspected, fined, taxed and harassed out of business. I will use your own tactics against you.
5926 2018-05-09 14:56:47 Mainly, apologizing for overthrowing the democratically elected Iranian leader through covert ops by paying for the Oil we stole, what a terrible peace promoting deal. 
5927 2018-05-09 14:56:44 I'm paying more for gas, food, and rent than I have in 3yrs. Had to get a2nd job last year. Today, the price of oil has skyrocketed again. I was taken off the voter roll in TN last year. 61 & hv never been taken off a voter roll. Just happened to check bcs a friend said I should.
5928 2018-05-09 14:56:44 บัตรเราเองค่าาา โดนเอาไปแอบอ้าง เราอยู่ระยองนะคะ และบัตรมีเจ้าของหมดแล้ว
5929 2018-05-09 14:56:43 Trump's buddy, Putin, will make boatloads of money now with the price of oil skyrocketing
5930 2018-05-09 14:56:42 "Current oil prices offer potential upside for energy companies’ earnings and stock prices, Most energy companies have budgeted for mid-$50s oil prices in 2018, reflected in share prices today. This = valuation upside if current levels of oil prices holds
5931 2018-05-09 14:56:38 Agreed, Both have been around a lot longer than America too.
The US is manipulating Israel and Saudi Arabia to act as their policemen in the ME to protect the Oil flow.
Netanyahu, in my mind a rampant Zionist, cannot help fast enough, his fake anti Iran presentation says it all

5934 2018-05-09 14:56:28 She actually said nobody has job security, ask an oil patch worker.
5935 2018-05-09 14:56:27 $70 a barrel oil is not good for the economy I don't care what anyone says! $SPX $SPY
5936 2018-05-09 14:56:27 What does the US withdrawal from the Iran deal mean for you? Local fuel prices are likely to rise further, as Iran (the world's 5th-largest oil producer) is forced to pull some of its crude off the market.
5937 2018-05-09 14:56:27 If I tell my mom I have stomach ache she’ll be like “put tika” (coconut oil)  everything is tika

I want comfort.
5947 2018-05-09 14:55:49 Me being a mong, I had the oven switched off at the wall and the hob was still turned on full, so when I’ve gone to use the oven there was 2 pans of oil on top that caught fire and then the fire caught onto my microwave and some other stuff, was a few inches away from gas pipes x
5948 2018-05-09 14:55:43 No problem. I know we wouldn't mind a candidate emailing and asking. Sometimes you end up sending out lesson information with a lot of assumptions in... Amusingly when I was interviewed for my current teaching post I was given the topic 'crude oil'... Talk about vague!

5951 2018-05-09 14:55:20 We need to stop talking about ‘stability’ That’s a Western ‘liberal’ (ahem!) term for “we want quiet & oil—and screw the ‘natives’”. There’ll be no ‘stability’ without FREEDOM for ‘the natives’—nor should there be. Let’s talk about FREEDOM! Howz that for a truly liberal concept?

5963 2018-05-09 14:54:34 Been interesting watching foreign policy experts going on US TV, including fmr USG officials who put the sanctions on Iran in the first place, now point out that @realDonaldTrump's miscalculation yesterday could lead to end of dollar based oil trade (aka PetroDollar). #IranDeal
5964 2018-05-09 14:54:28 This acct (@mlgyoffice) called me a "sheep" for not following his outright dumb short thesis for oil. Oil now > $71. Picture this "trader" averaging until he wins or goes broke. Careful following those with a large ego. #OOTT
5965 2018-05-09 14:54:28 Problem is the only "solution" I've ever heard come out of his fat, dumb mouth in regards to oil is to take the oil of other countries we've invaded.

5967 2018-05-09 14:54:25 strange...so he exports less takes a hit... for US's benefit?:) As production keeps rising..he will have to keep on exporting less and less:)
5968 2018-05-09 14:54:23 Yes because whining in public about Trudeau will really help things along. Shutting off the oil is also likely unconstitutional. So yeah, great ideas.

5971 2018-05-09 14:54:06 It’s difficult to see how America’s global reach won’t be diminished by this move. Strengthens key allies, esp on oil price, but at a cost to many more don’t you think?
5972 2018-05-09 14:53:57 So US #OIL production at record 10.7m bpd last week, says @EIAgov . Simple question for the President, ‘Would that have been the case if #OPEC hadn’t been “at it again” as he puts it creating “artificially high” prices? What price US Energy Independence?
5973 2018-05-09 14:53:51 It will have an effect on the € no doubt as Iran has changed from the $, I wonder if the EU had budgeted for Iran’s Oil being sold in Euros seen as they will probably be sanctioned by the US for doing so

5980 2018-05-09 14:53:33 Oil is the highest it's been in 4 years, gas prices are highest they've been in 4 years, and going up...who benefits from that? The Donald's business buddies who own the companies and those who invest in them. He uses his position to manipulate the market for their benefit.

5983 2018-05-09 14:53:22 #Iran currently ships just over 2 million barrels of oil a day. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, China was the biggest importer of Iranian crude, buying 24% of Iran's oil exports, followed by India (18%) and South Korea (14%).

5993 2018-05-09 14:52:47 The fossil fuel industry paid off Trump to dump the Iran deal so oil prices would rise. Think Trump did it if there was not something in it for Donny? Don't  be so naive. American's going for the @realDonaldTrump con again!
5994 2018-05-09 14:52:42 Gas prices have also been soaring because there is no threat of competition. For all the derision PBO got for his "all of the above" energy policy, he supported green technologies which put oil companies on notice. DT has decimated the entire field.

Did thhe government sell arms to saudi or was that vickers and britsh areospace? Think they are also not govrnment owned. The UK could afford to spend billions
5998 2018-05-09 14:52:28 North Korea doesn’t have large oil fields. Iran does.
5999 2018-05-09 14:52:23 Oh BS.  He pulled out cause it was an "Obama deal", but more importantly, it will drive up oil, which helps RUSSIA.  Everything he does is to benefit Russia and you know it.  We have a traitor in the oval. Congress ignores so they can confirm conservative judges.  Shame.

6003 2018-05-09 14:52:16 Not really, Iran said it will maintain the deal if UE, Russia and especially China (where Iran export its oil) will support it.
6004 2018-05-09 14:52:15 Europe does get most of its oil from Russia, but I would be interested to see why you think this gives Russia more bargaining power over them? SA and the US are the major exporters or oil outside Russia, so Iran doesn't matter as much.

6026 2018-05-09 14:51:21 Hello to The Russian oil that's going to flood the market.
6027 2018-05-09 14:51:17 You understand that the US doesn't buy oil from Russia, right? And it's unlikely that this will increase UK gas prices either. You want to know why has prices are rising, check out Saudi Arabia. They are forcing prices up because they want to be more economically powerful.
6028 2018-05-09 14:51:15 On top of that this will prevent most countries tries including N. Korea from making a deal with us because we can't stick to our own terms. So now it's possible N. Korea could be a bigger issue than it already was. Iran controls a lot of oil too. Now gas prices can sky rocket.
6029 2018-05-09 14:51:14 Boeing and others lose, oil companies win, America’s consumers (99%) and workers lose.

6031 2018-05-09 14:50:53 I would not lose sight of OPEC's intense focus on growing longer-term global E&P investment and thus production. Avoiding major oil price spikes is a reasonable goal (now and in a few years). Placating the US on its go-alone Iran strategy is not. Perhaps OPEC just tweaks the pact

6105 2018-05-09 14:45:33 Este viernes 11 de Mayo. OIL retorna a la Muela con muchas sorpresas para la noche. TRIBU nos vemos el Viernes. desde las 21:00
6106 2018-05-09 14:45:31 Nice move, oil price is getting higher, good for US fracing companies. Mission acomplished but environment will pay for it...
6107 2018-05-09 14:45:25 Well it's time to shore up your 401Ks, with @realDonaldTrump 's decision to pull out of the Iran Deal, oil prices will skyrocket and the stock market will take a dive.  I'm putting my funds in Bonds until this blows over.

6109 2018-05-09 14:45:15 Ewwww how weird! Fortified from the oil on sheep's wool 
6110 2018-05-09 14:45:13 Oil up, dollar roars, prisoners coming home. The press, EU and Obamanistas say the sky is falling.
6111 2018-05-09 14:45:13 Well the #irandeal is still in place.  @realDonaldTrump just decided America shouldn't get access to Iran anymore.  oh and this should increase oil profits to Russia.  What an interesting side note
6112 2018-05-09 14:45:12 Funny, however US will more than take the slack in oil production! They are pumping oil like maddd!..and that tax cut...
6113 2018-05-09 14:45:03 Bullish crude oil data on Wednesday as EIA Inventory Data supported API data with a draw of 2,197k bbl vs. est of +1,000. Doesn't look like crude is topping today
6114 2018-05-09 14:45:00 Don’t agree. He still has influence among others who do have that power. I’m sorry for his loss, but he & other warmongers need to be sorry for the losses of many sons & daughters due to their war follies. There’s no reason for us to be there other than to make oil barons richer.
6115 2018-05-09 14:44:56 I took my van for an oil change and the guy that worked on my car looked like @ThatFio if he was 18 and had facial hair
6116 2018-05-09 14:44:47 Actually read the entire thing and it makes no mention of Bush changing how oil is traded by eliminating the requirement for people to actually take ownership of the oil they buy. By doing this he introduced more volatility into the US markets.
6117 2018-05-09 14:44:44 How the everloving FUCK does the NRA benefit from this? You're a damn lunatic. I don't really see Russia benefitting from this either, this makes us more hostile to Iran which is bad for Russia. China isn't even relevant in this. Oil countries support this, yes.
6118 2018-05-09 14:44:43 Not only the oil companies you know.....
6119 2018-05-09 14:44:41 How come the price doesn't go down when oil is cheap? I've heard Iran may be sitting on top of a truly massive oil deposit, but not being a geologist, I simply don't know.
6120 2018-05-09 14:44:41 @mosesharding The India 10Y was up 1.68%! Does the yield move in such ranges? Or is the crude oil price overhang?
6121 2018-05-09 14:44:28 Intra-day topping tail on oil. Possible topping tail on the daily chart. On watch.

6128 2018-05-09 14:44:13 @GasBuddyDan  I have been listening to you for a long time. I don't know what you do about gas prices. Hurricane, upcoming winter, oil prices, wholesale gas price etc price. oil is less than 1/2 of its peak of $145, 2008 but gas is same as price of 2008??

6130 2018-05-09 14:44:00 Interesting question Eric; wondering what your thought is behind this. Oil has been on a massive tear but if COT is anything to go by, commercials & swap dealers are massively short - largest on record. Are u thinking oil crash here?

Trump wanted to focus on internal issues more - economic growth, infrastructure & opioid crisis which bringing our soldiers home - but we hear more of N.Korea & Iran...
6141 2018-05-09 14:42:59 Now we watch this number, because we NEED the oil, not because it represents too much oil. For some, a real flip of the script.  For others, it's been the story for over 12 months, now coming to be.
6142 2018-05-09 14:42:54 Cuticles: Pure vitamin E oil is also an effective treatment for dry, cracked cuticles. Applying a few drops of vitamin E oil to nails and cuticles helps to rehydrate and smooth them as well as prevent future cracks.

Aren't the CO2 emissions dangerous enough already? There are dangers with both, but electric seems much better.

6334 2018-05-09 14:30:56 US oil production has been rising since January 2017.  The break-even price for shale oil is now well below $50, but there is a short term benefit, and maybe a chance to float some Aramco or Rosneft shares.

6352 2018-05-09 14:30:20 @jimmy_dore Trumps possible idea of moving away from the Iran deal is so that as long as we are in there Israel won'd do too many attacks on Iran. If we are not there than no other country will defend Iran and if Iran retaliates then the US can invade for the oil.

6371 2018-05-09 14:30:01 We're at the Four Corners Oil & Gas Conference today and tomorrow, don't forget to stop by booth #435 to say hi!
6372 2018-05-09 14:29:53 Rocket, spinach and sweet potato whizzed into a "pesto" (garlic, pine nuts, and olive oil added if we're allowed) - chargrill the squid and toss through the pesto. Finished with lemon! 
6373 2018-05-09 14:29:52 Yep got some of those ta, and to be fair that picture was taken before I applied them. They are great, but messy. I keep hearing people talk about oil washes also?
6374 2018-05-09 14:29:45 Will they accept used oil bottles, filters, and oil-contaminated paper towels? I have a trash bag full of that stuff and don’t know what to do with it.

6378 2018-05-09 14:29:39 Oil will soon be a rare commodity in America.

6387 2018-05-09 14:28:53 Russia and Iran have long been working on oil-for-goods deals worth up to $20bn, since cash-strapped Iran has been under western sanctions over its nuclear programme. Under these agreements Moscow would buy Iranian oil in exchange for Russian equipment and technology. Russia wins
6388 2018-05-09 14:28:48 Went to the dealership for an oil change and routine maintenance on my Corvette only to find out that I now need four new tires and other maintenance work (AC and Fuel Maintenance). Basically I went from paying nothing to $3,000 in expenses!

6394 2018-05-09 14:28:20 Lol. Just like Buhari promised to regulate global oil prices? Bogus promises for gullible masses
6395 2018-05-09 14:28:13 Higher oil prices for an energy independent and exporting country means more money in the coffers! That's a good thing!
6396 2018-05-09 14:28:10 They're running out of oil and in the near future will be dependent on the USA and Israel hence our debt  will go down.  All because of our PRESIDENT TRUMP
6397 2018-05-09 14:28:08 The US keeps the Saud family in power because of oil, the US invaded Iraq in 1991 because of oil, and again removed Saddam after keeping him in power because he started messing with oil. Stop pushing nonsense and start sticking to facts!
6398 2018-05-09 14:27:54 The Shah was controlling oil price, he made biggest army in mideast and many other things. USA and UK were not happy. But Khomeini broke his promises, occupied Us ambassy and......
6399 2018-05-09 14:27:48 What makes you think Israel has “such influence over US policy”? What proof is there to this opinion? I thought Wikileaks is about facts.  I got news for you:  a desert nation of 8 million people isn’t what influences US policy, it is OIL. Follow the money.
6400 2018-05-09 14:27:45 The other thing that is misunderstood is that higher fuel prices starve the less efficient legacy players of the oxygen that is profits. It hastens their demise. Perversely therefore RYA and EZJ want higher oil prices (which they pass on with a lag to consumers)
6401 2018-05-09 14:27:41 For me, I think @realDonaldTrump  is right in pulling out cos Iran never adhered to the deal terms.
At the same time, I think America want to sell its shale oil cos they really have so much oil in stock and wanna keep Iran out of market.
I still go with trump on this anyway.
6402 2018-05-09 14:27:39 And I trade oil futures and oil futures options.  And I work in the technology side of commodity trading futures.  So, I know how things work as well.  Our gas prices go up, because refiners must pay more for their feed stock because those prices are directly impacted by futures.

6411 2018-05-09 14:26:59 Perhaps, but more likely to increase oil prices, benefiting Putin and the Kochs.

6414 2018-05-09 14:26:56 Yes the most important factor here is isolation. No other Nation withdraws from the deal. It puts us further into isolation which will further harm our economy..... lets start with the oil price hike.

6416 2018-05-09 14:26:52 @JoeNBC I’m no doubt the last to point this out but ....... scrap Iran deal > oil price spikes > Russia / Saudi Arabia / Us frackers gain bigley. Or am I way too cynical?
6417 2018-05-09 14:26:39 #LiberalTalkingPoint: "The price of oil will sky rocket now that we're out of the #IranDeal."
#FunFact: The US doesn't buy oil from #Iran.
6418 2018-05-09 14:26:34 it is true. Akhannouch is also the owner of Moove oil . Some Afriquia gas stations became Moove oil stations.

6420 2018-05-09 14:26:26 Yes. And now Russia will start raking in money through oil sales.  EVERYTHING has been about milking the American people dry. Undermining our unity, destroying the diplomatic corps, decimating our environmental protections ... it's all about lining the pockets of Putin & Trump.
6421 2018-05-09 14:26:22 i’m getting my oil changed i feel so grown :)))))
6422 2018-05-09 14:26:07 So India will continue to buy Iranian oil and pay in Euros, China will continue to buy cheaper Iranian oil and pay in Yuans....in the meantime higher energy costs are quickly becoming a major headwind for US growth, w/energy cost offsetting any/all gains from lower taxes!

6426 2018-05-09 14:25:42 @fmkaplan you’re completely missing the point. The reason Putin appointed Trump was to destabilize relations with Iran and cause the price of oil to rise resulting in billions for Putin and millions in bonuses for Trump. @PeteDominick
6427 2018-05-09 14:25:40 Be careful though Mix it with a little coconut oil it super strong but it cleared my pump/keloid  on my nose
6428 2018-05-09 14:25:37 Oil below $40 Bbl would really suck for the Russian economy. Dumping the Iran deal is win win for Trump Putin.

6431 2018-05-09 14:25:28 Crude oil $71/barrel and rising. Can you say $3.00/gal by the end of the week. And don't be surprised if crude oil is not near $100/barrel by the end of the month. Thank you Chump.
6432 2018-05-09 14:25:25 I had to get an emergency oil change at Valvoline and I'm pissed.
6433 2018-05-09 14:25:13 The cost of a barrel of oil has gone up 16% this year in anticipation of Trump pulling out of the Iran deal.  He has been talking about this since before he was elected on the campaign trail.  Millions of American families are barely making ends meet thanks to Trump.

6436 2018-05-09 14:24:42 We will hear lots about Europe accusing us of standing up in our righteous indignation. Remember, after spending the trillions of dollars in Iraq,  France was quick to jump on those oil leases. Ok, calitalism, good thing #Bastiat /4

6439 2018-05-09 14:24:37 That's a valid argument. It was all about Iranian oil in 1914, 1919, 1940 & 1953.
6440 2018-05-09 14:24:37 Russia will be in real strife when the world transitions to renewable energy. Exports of oil & gas will cease. Couldn't happen to a nicer despot.
6441 2018-05-09 14:24:33 You forgot to add increase Putin's and Koch's cash flows while screwing the base with higher oil prices.
6442 2018-05-09 14:24:27 Not to worry. The US exported it's first super tanker of oil to China in the last couple of weeks.

6445 2018-05-09 14:24:10 Yes. And now Russia will start raking in money through oil sales.  EVERYTHING has been about milking the American people dry. Undermining our unity, destroying the diplomatic corps, decimating our environmental protections; it's all about lining the pockets of Putin & Trump.
6446 2018-05-09 14:24:09 Trump didn’t humiliate them.
He continues to humiliate us, while aiding and abetting Putin!
Why not report how many rubles will now pour into Putin’s coffers because oil prices will soar?
That’s news.
6447 2018-05-09 14:24:08 Haha! She is definitely worth being an oil painting eh!!
6448 2018-05-09 14:24:07 #Vlad is winning if oil prices go up. That is all that matters to @realDonaldTrump.

6462 2018-05-09 14:22:54 You believe in markets, right? They respond to prices. You understand that, right? Canadian governments have no control over the price oil. This is not news to you, right? All the companies involved made market-based decisions. Apparently, you want to intervene in the market.
6463 2018-05-09 14:22:50 In Syria, they are close to a war with Israel due to them trying to establish a front with Israel in the Golan .

In Yemen , their funding of the Houthis helped make the situation worse, as the Saudis see them as a direct threat (Given Yemen is close to Saudia's oil fields) /2

6466 2018-05-09 14:22:39 Won't be likely. Putin loathes Jews and wants oil from the moooooslums.
6467 2018-05-09 14:22:35 Destabilize middle east what happens oil prices go UP not the first time. Russia makes money selling their stolen oil they get rich.

6479 2018-05-09 14:21:31 Yea, dude’s a Russian that you’re kissing up to.  

If sanctions prohibit Iranians from selling oil, reduce world output, then Russian oil prices up!

6484 2018-05-09 14:21:18 The WORLD knows it's UK oil. The question remains, if Scotland (after 250yrs of servicing England's debts) had been independent for the last 2 generations only. Would it be like it's northern, independent neighbour, with a minted sovereign fund. Where could it be in 1 generation?

6487 2018-05-09 14:21:04 I think you answered your own question Maurice, if Canada was pumping oil the party would suddenly be over in Dubai. It's sad that we (Canada) allows that to happen.
6488 2018-05-09 14:21:00 HE IS AN OIL STAIN ON TWITTER.
6489 2018-05-09 14:20:50 Fake News! I have significant knowledge of energy industry. Have you ever heard of “supply and demand “? Through horizontal drilling the USA is well positioned to meet and exceed energy demands. As price of oil increases, drilling increases.

6505 2018-05-09 14:19:10 @realDonaldTrump do you think families are gonna be able to afford this increase in gas prices? Home heating oil?
6506 2018-05-09 14:19:09 China and Iran are allies, China already buys Iran oil and is developing more oil fields.
Trump just guaranteed they will get it cheaper.
China is working towards controlling all oil movement in Asia.

6509 2018-05-09 14:18:39 And if Iran develops a WMD he will blame @BarackObama. This along with starting a trade war, oil prices rising due to his policies, and nominating people who are unqualified and or unethical is his definition of making America great again. Right out of the J.R. Ewing playbook.
6510 2018-05-09 14:18:30 not sure if the goal is to do anything with fuel bills $ ( consumer )  extract - refine and distribute in Canada - we have enough oil to meet the countries needs - that way we have a clear picture on GHGs and incentives / penalties to meet Paris -

6526 2018-05-09 14:17:04 Chinese cities have c.100,000 electric metro buses, and are adding a London-sized fleet every five weeks. Yes, that erases about 250,000 b/d of potential demand. But oil demand is rising by 1-2 million b/d. So, not major yet.
6527 2018-05-09 14:16:59 Oil & gas price increases help Trump’s pal Vlad an awful lot.
6528 2018-05-09 14:16:48 Everything hitting me in the month of May. New tires, tag renewal, oil change, on top of my monthly bills.  I had to make sure my DL wasn’t expiring this month and year too.  Nevertheless, I thank God I got it though.

6532 2018-05-09 14:16:36 Another crock of bull.  The US has enough oil to take care of itself for years and years.
6533 2018-05-09 14:16:30 pretty normal
1)Iran,we got all 'info' now. So it's over
2)interest rates steady.Ok, high, BUT, never doubt a bullish argument
3)oil, a touch up, but forget that
4)EM in a bit of hot soup. But they always serve their soup spicy/hot
5)turbulence in Middle East, prob a sand storm
6534 2018-05-09 14:16:27 #OOTT alot of people on this mentioning what happens to the OPEC+ deal after Trump pulled the Iran deal.  Saudis need $88 oil to balance their books, and if they didn't do anything W/ Venezuela declines, they won't now
6535 2018-05-09 14:16:25 Yes.  And now Russia will start raking in money through oil sales.  EVERYTHING has been about milking the American people dry. Undermining our unity, destroying the diplomatic corps, decimating our environmental protections ... it's all about lining the pockets of Putin & Trump.
6536 2018-05-09 14:16:22 One word... “oil”.  Dirty Russian oil to be specific.
6537 2018-05-09 14:16:18 All of that is available for free.  If you would like to help the cause and have it sent to you that option is available as well.  You see no snake oil or ads.  The legitimacy of his work is hurting your feelings.

6554 2018-05-09 14:14:47 I go to my brother’s shop and have him put my car on the lift and then change the oil myself
6555 2018-05-09 14:14:40 France, Germany, UK have entered into legally binding security treaties with the US hence must keep in mind US interests. PS: Iranian oil which was 13% of the Indian oil basket pre-sanction was reduced to 5% post- sanctions so India has kept US interests in mind.
6556 2018-05-09 14:14:37 This was predicted.  Now we will go in to Iran for some reason but it will actually be to take over the oil.  Lawlessness will happen then comes, well you know
6557 2018-05-09 14:14:35 Rising oil prices are a double-edged sword for the world economy.
6558 2018-05-09 14:14:35 By the way, you can counteract the rise in oil prices by investing in oil companies.  Their gain becomes your gain.
6559 2018-05-09 14:14:32 rising crude oil
6560 2018-05-09 14:14:06 Could it be that higher prices on oil could help his buddy, Putin?  Russia produces 12% of the world’ s oil.
6561 2018-05-09 14:13:59 Some shale fields do produce primarily LNG, but quite a few produce tight oil.

6568 2018-05-09 14:13:26 An interesting point of view.....though the deal is much beyond oil..... It totally depends on India now if they would want to strengthen its equation with Iran to develop trade via Chhabahar & further to Afghanistan or to be in the US camp...or ???

The US and the UK give billions worth of weapons, and buy their oil. The Saudi government funds "WAHHABISM" aka JIHADISM. 

In effect the US and UK governments fund jihadists, and arms them
6583 2018-05-09 14:11:58 And Russia gets to launder Iran's sanctioned oil. Iranian oil will still be sold on every market, but now Russia gets a cut.

6593 2018-05-09 14:11:22 Agreed. Furthermore, the oil price had risen 3% today. More expensive petrol will eat into family budgets, which will lead to spending reductions and an impact on the economy. Got a feeling 2nd quarter GDP will will be interesting.

6610 2018-05-09 14:10:02 Remember, it's not just because the deal was Obama's, it's also because regional uncertainty drives up oil prices, which Putin personally and politically profits from. #cuibono #IranNuclearDeal #greatgame

6612 2018-05-09 14:09:59 Sanctions will hurt the Iranian people and return Iran's oil to the scumbags in the black market; gas prices will increase for Americans. This is a siege.
6613 2018-05-09 14:09:54 Yep, let's get those oil prices up. GWB 101 pt2
6614 2018-05-09 14:09:46 INDIAN OIL BUYERS SAY THEY’LL LOOK TO KEEP PAYING IRAN IN EUROS
6615 2018-05-09 14:09:41 No worries - I’ll add it to our club’s weekly email too - no promises but with around 100 members I’d like to think someone would be up for it!! Although getting lost in a rape seed oil field just yesterday was pretty embarrassing!!
6616 2018-05-09 14:09:34 We told the world, we won't take yes for an answer. Let's see how North Korea reacts knowing that  no matter what we agree  to do, any promise the United States makes is questionable.  Don't forget the Sunnis who attacked us in 9/11 and biggest promoter of terrorism. Oil money =
6617 2018-05-09 14:09:18 Apparently this whole Trump getting out the iran deal might not only increase the chance of us getting nuked but also raise oil PRICES WHAT THE FUCK
6618 2018-05-09 14:09:07 2tbsp C60 oil?
6619 2018-05-09 14:09:06 And Russian TV is crowing that the price of oil will now go up, helping the weak Russian economy.
6620 2018-05-09 14:09:04 She belongs in jail. Torture doesn't work and even if it did, it turns us into terrorists. We are not "police of the world"; we are mercenaries, just ask Saudi Arabia. We are not a country of law and order, we have lost our moral compass for money and oil. Fuck you @BarackObama

6626 2018-05-09 14:08:40 I also note that one of the ingredients in this vegan faux-burger is palm oil. 

So, any vegan who buys this crap can spare me all the sanctimonious preaching about the lives of animals. The palm oil industry has single-handedly driven the Sumatran orangutan to near-extinction.
6627 2018-05-09 14:08:35 This isn't about liberals, Trump just undermined the office of the presidency for future dealings and loses European partners in the process. Winners: strategically-China & Russia, financially-S. Arabia, lobbyists & oil companies and politically-Israel.
6628 2018-05-09 14:08:29 I look forward to the day that the USA is oil independent,  maybe they'll stop invading/attacking middle eastern countries.

6631 2018-05-09 14:08:20 Don’t worry I’ve got a place I take my car for oil changes. It’s just that I’m not due for one for another 1,000 miles supposedly but my dash says I need one
6632 2018-05-09 14:08:14 "China adds about 9,500 EV buses every five weeks—the size of London’s entire fleet—and collectively, they’re making a dent in the oil industry. For every 1,000 EV buses, according to the report, the global demand for fuel drops by about 500 barrels a day."

6634 2018-05-09 14:07:53 Exactly, so we can “justify” going after Iran’s oil. Oh wait, that was Iraq.
6635 2018-05-09 14:07:44 Damn, thats so sad you say that. People pick your fruits, make your food at chipotle, McDonald's, kitchen prep at olive garden, or complete your oil changes, stock grocery stores, deliver your news papers, or even process your payments as you pay your cellphone or utility bill 
6636 2018-05-09 14:07:39 More likely their frustration derives from watching such recent history so badly vandalized. So far, the Liberals have merely approved two pipeline upgrades. Under the Harper Conservative government, two entirely new oil pipelines were approved and actually built:
6637 2018-05-09 14:07:29 China is going to move into Afghanistan and then into Iran. Will be sitting on the Persian Gulf. Its direct overland access to the oil and gas from this region.
6638 2018-05-09 14:07:25 Please mr president I’m 100% in with your America first but the oil companies have said that extra money in our checks from tax cuts is not yours it’s ours...every time we get a break they take it. Gas up to 3:00 per gallon.

6655 2018-05-09 14:06:22 There is an easy way to check this. African elders have been consuming palm oil for generations and for recent decades.. and they mostly live to their 100s. Don't allow the western media dictate everything you eat or what's healthy.
6656 2018-05-09 14:06:14 High ass oil change
6657 2018-05-09 14:06:02 To let you slores know trump denied the bill pertaining to oil. So guess what that means. Gas prices are about to rise. Time to fill up my gas can!
6658 2018-05-09 14:05:59 Oil/gas corporations don’t care about the planet or anything on it man or animal they would/will drill ever square inch & the governments can’t stop them bc they r the governments. Our planet is run by the oil/gas conglomerates & the military complexes
6659 2018-05-09 14:05:55 KSA wants high oil too.  Not just for income but for the ARAMCO IPO.
6660 2018-05-09 14:05:49 What trump has really done is raise the price of gas, boost profits for oil companies, guaranty China invests more money into Iran oil, kill any chances of Canada selling oil to China, strengthen bonds between Iran, China and Russia and guaranty more conflicts in the middle east.

6662 2018-05-09 14:05:46 @carney Oil prices did not go down you lying propagandist piece of dirt. Only US crude futures went down. World index went up.
6663 2018-05-09 14:05:29 Note silence on Russia benefiting from Trump induced surge in oil prices.
6664 2018-05-09 14:05:25 By that logic, we should have a downside risk on EM FX (for energy importers). Also since it's GS, makes a lot of sense to short their view. Probably oil top is in place, just like the bottom was when GS called for 20$ or so
6665 2018-05-09 14:05:25 Definitely! I used to take fish oil every day, now I take it infrequently but still think it's a great addition to anyone's supplement regiment.

6673 2018-05-09 14:04:49 @AnnMcFeatters Read your column in my local paper. Pruitt’s letter...he is a threat for compromising the environmental health of our “once” great nation. He thinks “god” wants us to use oil? Such a ridiculous hypocritical statement. He needs to go.
6674 2018-05-09 14:04:30 Now that Trump has heaped sanctions on Iran, oil prices are expected to increase. 

Iran exports over 2 million barrels of crude per day. 

Uncertainty clouds the entire oil markets. The market hates uncertainties.
6675 2018-05-09 14:04:25 Oil now at $75 a barrel, BP plan to take 200,000 barrels a day from North Sea till 2050. It’s only thick Unionists that see Oil as a curse and something that should be handed over to Westminster. Get off your knees ya

6678 2018-05-09 14:04:02 I bet you won't mention the stagnant stock market, or surging oil prices....
6679 2018-05-09 14:03:54 Bofrot doesn’t come back to its original shape after squeezing. Moreover, we don’t want oil on our hands but juices
6680 2018-05-09 14:03:53 Well Iran could increase oil production and China could float its Greenback stock into the market, just to play around; Europe starts to talk with Putin who is more reliable than Trump, and all Americans are on an island - or in a bakery

6686 2018-05-09 14:03:44 Trump and his friends have shares in #NobleEnergy the oil company which invest in the Israeli oil .
6687 2018-05-09 14:03:32 You get your oil changed at your dealership?
6688 2018-05-09 14:03:32 The inevitability of war with Iran seems to be on the horizon. Destabilization of the middle east would drive up the price of oil.  Some would like that to happen.
6689 2018-05-09 14:03:28 Yes indeed! I switched from olive oil to argon oil and my hair don’t know how to act!! Lol
6690 2018-05-09 14:03:25 Now with tRump trying to back out of the Iran deal oil prices will sky rocket so tRump will step in an slow these lands to be used by his buddy's to search for oil at home. Another tRump crime family money scam.
6691 2018-05-09 14:03:20 This maniac has no political agenda. He doesn't give a damn about peace in ME, Israels safety or democracy in Iran. Behind all this are a pure economic aims. He wants to please the Saudis, who will buy more US weapons. And he wants higher oil prices, to please US oil producers.
6692 2018-05-09 14:03:17 Yes, but someone pointed out the Russia benefits from higher oil prices; so, this should do it.
6693 2018-05-09 14:03:11 Why does Jamie Oliver mush everything with his hands and cover absolutely everything in olive oil it gives me the boak
6694 2018-05-09 14:03:10 Oil and gas spiking, too. #MAGA folks, be sure to thank your president at your next fill up.
6695 2018-05-09 14:03:08 You know what worse? The palm tree oil that used for producing wide variety of goods, was not gettingn any better. The plantation company not putting enough money for r&d to make better superior plant.
6696 2018-05-09 14:03:07 Rising oil prices are in the interests of a lot of geopolitical actors, not the least of which is the US, Saudi Arabia, and Russia. A few months ago, an Iranian drone violated Israeli airspace in a test. After numerous Israeli strikes, it would be little wonder Iran might attack.
6697 2018-05-09 14:03:06 Damn tea tree oil gone take me out
6698 2018-05-09 14:03:03 Oil is essentially in a league by itself as it completely dominates the transportation market.
Natural gas can, and is competing with all the other options. Natural gas is as clean as a fossil fuel can be. Replacing coal with it is a win-win situation.
6699 2018-05-09 14:03:02 俺が聞きたいよ
6700 2018-05-09 14:02:57 Price of Brent crude oil is up 50% per barrel in terms of sterling over the last year (£37.7 to £56.5pb). Up ~58% in $US. UK petrol  / diesel prices up 5.3% & 6.4% y/y respectively.
6701 2018-05-09 14:02:51 Yes! And US military equipment uses up oil faster than it leaves the ground!
6702 2018-05-09 14:02:49 So that Iran Nuclear Deal pullout just wiped out any tax break gains for middle America (what little there was) since all that extra income will go in the gas tank to get back and forth to work. Oil already up to $70 a barrel. Thanks for nothing Trump.
6703 2018-05-09 14:02:44 Oil Prices set to rise because of Trump, that’ll make him very popular with people.

6710 2018-05-09 14:02:17 Iran deal or un-deal just makes it easier for Russia to destabilize the middle east and make those oil prices to go up. Wake up it's about the oil always has been. I expect 5.00 a gal prices at some time this year. Spin city is spinning out of control.

6738 2018-05-09 13:59:55 Masha Allah mbrook 
6739 2018-05-09 13:59:44 That’s precisely how the bottom fell out of oil a few years ago. The US, not Saudi Arabia is now the swing producer.
6740 2018-05-09 13:59:37 so did #Trump pull out of the Iran deal to help oil prices move higher? Great for the Oil and gas industry, not so much for the average American who has his budget eat into with higher costs to fill their tank. #MAGA?
6741 2018-05-09 13:59:17 oil prices will go sky high,and the ones who voted him in will be the first to complain.

6743 2018-05-09 13:59:13 <Howard Marks quote about future price of oil>
6744 2018-05-09 13:59:10 Got Oil? Looks unstoppable to $100. Currently, Oil is up a stunning 173% from the lows under $30 in Feb 2016 to $70+ today. Superior Investing Through Research. #TheClarkBrothersWay #GetInvested #StayInvested #OnlyTheBest
6745 2018-05-09 13:59:08 Venezuela has lots of oil and piss poor 

Guess what ? Cause they spend more than they earn 

Dimwit
6746 2018-05-09 13:58:59 Third off that money was Iranian frozen by the sanctions so it's not American. Fourth off leaving the deal has just guaranteed no limits on their nuclear programme. And finally, the US/UK giving power to the brutal Shah for oil control and you wonder why they hate you? Mk
6747 2018-05-09 13:58:59 if the gold market is allowed to be made "big enough" to settle net offshore CNH balances created through CNH oil sales, the yuan will lack no attributes.  IMO this may be the goal of whoever has turned the gold market into a fake market since 2013 (USD/gold pegged at $1100-1300)
6748 2018-05-09 13:58:57 Of course not, but many oil states are authoritarian.
6749 2018-05-09 13:58:52 But Russia’s interests & ours should not be the same. For one, this will probably lead to higher oil prices, which hurts us and helps Russia. Also, Russia has been more militarily aligned with Iran & the Syrian regime, and this helps them on that issue
6750 2018-05-09 13:58:51 I don't seem to recall any GOP politician trying to sue oil companies for imaginary "climate change" issues, or preening about protecting women while beating and choking the women in their personal lives. Role playing my ass. Read your tweet and apply it to yourself, sir.
6751 2018-05-09 13:58:49 The hypocritical lifestylin' of this world is something else.... Imagine how Biafrans are being killed in the contraption called #Nigeria daily and nobody is saying or doing anything just because of oil & gas that's crazy.
6752 2018-05-09 13:58:44 Yeah but most vehicles run on gasoline derived from oil - not LNG. Also you can’t make plastic from LNG as far as I know.
6753 2018-05-09 13:58:44 This place has convinced me that I need essential oil diffusers in every room of my house
6754 2018-05-09 13:58:42 iran ( especially the IRGC) profits will increase too : in the time of the sanctions the price of oil was about 100$ and the IRGC was selling oil in the black market for a less price .with the withrdawal of the sanctions it was the gouv.who is selling so the IRGC was losing money
6755 2018-05-09 13:58:41 We can be assured we are doing the right thing. If I had to guess France and Germany’s biggest objections are related to their business interests with Iran, IE oil. Is less dependent on it now, thus impact to us is less. Always follow the money.
6756 2018-05-09 13:58:41 Sri Lanka is a price taker in the global market. Under pricing of fuel will result in over consumption of fuel. If there is a pricing formula, as global prices change, we will adjust accordingly. India & Pakistan have successfully implemented oil pricing systems #lka
6757 2018-05-09 13:58:36 Yes.  And now Russia will start raking in money through oil sales.  EVERYTHING has been about milking the American people dry. Undermining our unity, destroying the diplomatic corps, decimating our environmental protections ... it's all about greed.
6758 2018-05-09 13:58:35 Like the ten virgins....5 stayed and waited patiently, with oil on their lamps....lets do like them, fill ourselves with the Holy Spirit and wait for the very day to come, while we pray and keep awake ....GLORY BE TO GOD
6759 2018-05-09 13:58:17 Look who's winning: the military industrial complex and I'm going to guess Big Oil
6760 2018-05-09 13:58:14 there is a major difference in my hair when I do deep condition with a hot oil treatment versus when I don’t on wash day.
6761 2018-05-09 13:58:13 The average union official was a working man who had escaped from day labor by the help of a political machine inside the union. He spent more money than his salary.
Anything new posed a danger to his desk job & could mean having to go back to hard work.

6764 2018-05-09 13:58:07 If you listen really closely you can hear me out there telling someone to “put coconut oil on it”
6765 2018-05-09 13:58:04 the notion of the oil trade implications of this aggression is hardly being addressed by anyone and its pretty infuriating considering the direct correlation with Brazil and Venezuala's situations being entirely dependent here

6769 2018-05-09 13:57:49 does CBD oil help with period cramps im abt to die
6770 2018-05-09 13:57:45 Need t to mention the fact that every reduction in tax lowers the chance of ever balancing the budget without high oil prices.

6772 2018-05-09 13:57:43 These orgs have made careers out of propagandist advocacy. Their personal carbon footprint belies their words.They are hypocrites of the worst kind, preying upon fears with manipulated facts. CAN. needs the oil industry & IS clean with its development, unlike other countries! 
6773 2018-05-09 13:57:35 Wheres the mention of Watars oil pipeline
6774 2018-05-09 13:57:19 At a certain price(s) per-barrel, it becomes financially feasible for US drillers to restart hydrofracking wells.  There’s a lot of energy trapped in US shale fields. This is a natural check against high oil prices now, as supply floods the market from the restarted wells.
6775 2018-05-09 13:57:14 On my morning break today I put new windshield washer fluid in my car all by myself. I know this is probably not big news to most people, but I’ve never done it before (always had the mechanics do it during an oil change) and I’m feeling very accomplished and independent!

6779 2018-05-09 13:56:45 I have a small amount of $GNK, only mention it cause it has blown past expectations lately. Other notable surprises have come from $EC & $LNG, but those are oil & gas so maybe not so surprising
6780 2018-05-09 13:56:43 As a painter I’ve developed a style and it’s clearly bold, cartoony and colorful.. but I really want to challenge myself to do other art studies.. oil painting and airbrush painting along with abstract techniques I’ve never tried this year.. no one needs to go to art school.
6781 2018-05-09 13:56:40 you were shorting all the way up and averaging positions when oil moved from 56.1 to 66.66?  waited till elephant move it down to 58 and booked profits? funny moron.

6783 2018-05-09 13:56:38 Resources matter and oil is also a financial asset....Really doesn't matter to me what specific asset or political event is causative of a movement that is great enough to capture the attention of either people or algos. My definition of movement and where is what matters to me.
6784 2018-05-09 13:56:38 CS is similar to market, when you run around like an unskilled bitch without strategy, you'll get murdered and they'll love it n do it over and over. But there is no respawn with $800 anymore.
And you can't be good at all the guns, get good at two three and know to use others. :)
6785 2018-05-09 13:56:38 With oil prices about to go through the roof, we might not even have a goatskin, or shall I say yellow chaddi, to wrap around ourselves. 
6786 2018-05-09 13:56:12 Goldman Sachs says "medium term, we would expect to see greater shale supply response to high #oil prices, especially once pipeline bottlenecks in permian ease (2h19)" #OOTT

6788 2018-05-09 13:55:55 I hate when bby oil get on my clothes
6789 2018-05-09 13:55:50 Goldman Sachs says elevated #oil geopolitical risks exacerbate upside risks to brent forecasts and reinforce its view that oil price volatility will continue to increase #OOTT
6790 2018-05-09 13:55:49 Could be that people don’t like you...for example when you cancel agreements with Iran, oil prices rise as a result and the world goes back into recession. Might be things like that that do it. Just sayin’
6791 2018-05-09 13:55:47 Many are. Of course, most of the environmental community is trying to improve our energy consumption etc. But until we acknowledge true costs of oil, like actually building safe transportation, fossil fuels will have an unfair advantage. You have to work on the whole system.
6792 2018-05-09 13:55:39 Genius! So, let me get this straight .. they're saying that the more that fit hits the shan, the crazier oil markets get? And their analysts get paid what exactly?
6793 2018-05-09 13:55:37 Crude oil on the move again today. It is now trading above the psychological $70.00 level. Check out my trade level in the Daily Market Report tonight
6794 2018-05-09 13:55:32 Goldman Sachs says all else constant, estimates a 500 kb/d supply loss (due to Iran sanctions) until year-end would support #oil prices by $6.2/bbl #OOTT
6795 2018-05-09 13:55:27 Big auto, tobacco and oil learned that the best way to prevent us from caring about bad business is to ensure they are under educated.

Economy is booming - more people driving to work
demand for oil high
making money - tax rate lowered - more money coming in via taxes
but hey what's the news on Stormy????
6816 2018-05-09 13:53:48 ... & that won't happen while this regime can sell 3 million barrels of oil per day and spend the money on its cronies inside #Iran & abroad.
#ThankYouTrump
6817 2018-05-09 13:53:44 My guess would be that oil will top for the year between June 29 and July 6 and Brent will be back to mid 60’s by Christmas. But I don’t have a number for a name tag so keep that in mind.
6818 2018-05-09 13:53:41 This move was about saving the petrodollar and Saudi Arabia who own USA debt. It is not about terrorism it is about cheap oil.  Why does the world allow it? Because if the USA economies fails the world economy fails and a global depression begins.
6819 2018-05-09 13:53:38 More welfare for the oil industry.
6820 2018-05-09 13:53:38 Well, I do think you're being generous. I agree they are running a seat of your pants operation. But they do have a clear allegiance to Big Oil (see across the board moves at EPA and Interior).

6822 2018-05-09 13:53:28 Probably higher oil prices for a bit, too. Also gives them the moral high ground for sticking by the deal.

6827 2018-05-09 13:53:16 it was never about the nuclear , its just an excuse : 
the price of oil will increase
the Saudis and the multinationals profits will increase too 
Trump is a shareholder in some of the US oil companies , he got a promises from netanyahu to invest in the #Golan

6831 2018-05-09 13:53:00 Actually we are the 5 largest exporter of oil. It's Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, United Arab Emrites then Canada.  It is a profitable part of the economy but competing at the same level is hard. Given it costs too much to ship. No port access to the market. Pipeline is needed.
6832 2018-05-09 13:53:00 Those who buy gas in the US are choosing to be less extorted by US oil suppliers.

6845 2018-05-09 13:52:10 They were lying BEFORE the iran deal the lies were known before the treaty came into effect, they were complying with the treaty.  Puppetmaster Putin is pulling all the strings to get oil prices up and you are falling for it.

6849 2018-05-09 13:51:45 Sanctions will hurt the Iranian people and drive up the cost of gas for Americans. Iranian oil will be forced to the black market, giving business back to the scumbags who profit from destruction and chaos. Kushner's trip to Saudi Arabia and Israel should have been telling.

6851 2018-05-09 13:51:33 Our so called Sunni friends commit war crimes daily in Yemem. This whole issue is about oil production in which Iran was not sanctioned and producing more.  Maybe our Israeli assets inside Iran will be reporting to Trump if there will be any future compliance.
6852 2018-05-09 13:51:33 Oil prices up to $77 a barrel now thanks to nutjob #Trump. It was below $50 in January & we have 6 months before sanctions. Europe must stand up to this big bully on trade

6856 2018-05-09 13:51:22 As usual the actions taken by our government regarding foreign affairs is hurting us all. Stopping Iran and Venezuela from exporting oil means the cost goes up and regular people pay more for gas, while wealthy people collect more revenue from us all. There is no excuse.
6857 2018-05-09 13:51:11 That was yest, correction 17 mths ago. More interested in how it looks going forward. Given that Oil is most traded commodity in the world and China is the biggest buyer with several of the biggest producers (Russia, Iran, Venezuela) selling to them in yuan, expect major changes.
6858 2018-05-09 13:51:03 I don't understand how oil prices go up when they produce more. Shouldn't it be the opposite? I don't think demand has risen that much has it?
6859 2018-05-09 13:50:50 Y are oil changes so high
6860 2018-05-09 13:50:38 Know who benefits from US pulling out of Iran deal? Venezuela if the oil prices start to skyrocket. 

I don't think its good foreign policy, but could be the shot in the arm that Venezuela needs. Also Conoco sucks.

Your tariff and making the USA unreliable on the world stage will be the economy demise.  Oil and gas already rising.
6864 2018-05-09 13:50:21 $EGY is oil & gas related and seemed to turned a corner financially in 2017.  Betted a short swing on this today, loading a small lot.

6866 2018-05-09 13:50:17 Is napping in the dealership lobby while you wait for an oil change considered inappropriate?
6867 2018-05-09 13:50:17 People who think traring up the Iran deal is just about destroying Obama's legacy are.missing part of the picture. It IS that, but its also creating a less stable, more chaotic world, and making oil prices shoot up. Both of these things are bad for Americans, but great for Putin.
6868 2018-05-09 13:50:16 And when oh when Alise do you wanna protest Johnny Oil Train blocking my bus to Vancouver to chat with TransLink today?  Make sure @kris_sims has a speaking invite,  I'll be the warm up.
6869 2018-05-09 13:50:08 Bad deal? US blackmailed Iran with their own money, so they denuclearized. How is that a bad deal? It's a bad deal if a) you are a warmonger, b) you profit from defense contracts, c) you benefit from Iranian oil sanctions, d) you benefit from Iran's oil competitors like Saudi A.

6876 2018-05-09 13:49:47 Yes, Lash Slick is oil free!
6877 2018-05-09 13:49:42 Yes it's hard when real news reveals the truth. Then u must call it fake news. I understand Russia state tv has been praising u leaving the Iran deal (sad) because oil shooting up will finance Putins domestic policies ( 3 trillion rubles) ( bad).  Hillary was right about puppets.

6881 2018-05-09 13:49:30 Gasoline consumption going down 2% annually. This 25%of oil. Rest up 1%. USA as much oil as Saudis and Russia. Rig rate up in USA. Mostly shale. This price rise is political, until aramco goes public.
6882 2018-05-09 13:49:03 You can’t blame the oil companies for charging the astronomical prices.... we just accept it

6887 2018-05-09 13:48:49 Incorrect. While effects are not fully understood, mostly due to industry resistance, they are most certain and significant. Notably, the effects of sheens and chronic oil pollution on seabirds, incineration from flares, collisions, and seismic sounding disruptions.

6893 2018-05-09 13:48:19 Confirmation the U.S. is going for an exit from the Iran deal has seen crude rebounding today. A barrel of West Texas Intermediate for June delivery was trading at $70.96, with Brent at $76.86.  Should oil average $70/barrel this year, it would constitute a drag on U.S. growth.

6896 2018-05-09 13:47:52 "The Fund invests in public companies deriving revenue from any aspect along the Blockchain ecosystem."

I don't even know what this means. Does this mean they will be investing in all oil/gas companies, b/c it takes so much energy to mine digital coins?
6897 2018-05-09 13:47:48 The Iranians have every reason to be hostile to Trump's move; Britain's greed to control oil for decades, the U.S.-backed coup against democratically-elected Prime Minister Mossedeh in 1953, the installation of the Shah who repressed the people, and supporters of the Palestinians
6898 2018-05-09 13:47:45 .. that’s about oil and the elite. They make money off war, they don’t care about our soldiers lives and for anyone to support war and what it stands for I have one simple message for you, you are a idiot and a part of what’s wrong in this world #Trump #IranDealWithdrawl

6900 2018-05-09 13:47:27 Barrel of oil election day, 2016 about $44.00.  Today it is over $70.00. Guess where my tax cut money is going? You're welcome Big Oil. #TrickleUp
6901 2018-05-09 13:47:10 All you guys did was jerk each other off for an oil deal with Iran, accomplishing nothing.

6903 2018-05-09 13:47:07 The only reason for me to be happy about oil prices going up is: loonie is up! $CAD

6905 2018-05-09 13:46:59 i want to start an oil fanart this summer
6906 2018-05-09 13:46:56 Only people who love "Death to America" slogan are Iranian extremists and oil traders on Wall St.
6907 2018-05-09 13:46:52 Investors of long-term money are definitely trying to wrap their minds about this and what it means for risk/return.  Divesting from coal was the start, but concern around pipelines and oil and gas extraction are also in play

6912 2018-05-09 13:45:43 Well I was wondering the reason for the security posts. That now makes sense. Massive thank you to Adrian for all the updates today ..
6913 2018-05-09 13:45:36 I just knew oil would find a way 
6914 2018-05-09 13:45:30 ?  you probably change oil filters for a living.  Show some respect
6915 2018-05-09 13:45:29 The general rule is that US presidents do not affect crude oil prices or the price of gas. Current price increases are the exception to this rule. Threats by Trump to withdraw from the Iran agreement and his final action yesterday have had a direct bearing on crude oil prices.

6920 2018-05-09 13:44:50 URGENT: Trump and Interior Secretary Zinke are rushing to open the Arctic Refuge to oil and gas drilling. Act now and stand up against any move to open the Arctic Refuge to Big Polluters!
6921 2018-05-09 13:44:49 Apparently the "right" way to make coffee is to make it in a French press and mix in butter (or ghee) and MCT oil, then blend. Lol
6922 2018-05-09 13:44:47 @morningmika No No No No...and no. Pulling out of Iran deal might have distraction as a side benefit, BUT the main beneficiary is Trump's beloved Putin. US out, oil prices up, Russia benefits to the tune of billions.
Always keep your eyes on the prize when it comes to Trump.

6926 2018-05-09 13:44:15 I agree it's about the control of the region more than it's about Oil. Main reason why China & Russia also want a piece.
6927 2018-05-09 13:44:12 @chaosplanetdan are you coming back
6928 2018-05-09 13:44:06 I thought I remembered reading about this a few years ago, all part of shale gas/oil as well? Which, while controlversial for the environment meant less reliance on Middle East oil? Did that all disappear as soon as Trump took office?

6934 2018-05-09 13:43:45 Whites are actually responsible for almost all the atrocities in the middle east, they sent Jews to occupy Palestine, when Assad wanted to drop the pétrodollar system and usa attacked Syria and want to steal their oil as they did to Iraq and are planning to do in Iran right
6935 2018-05-09 13:43:41 Feeling bullish today on:

- "Defense" sector stocks
- Rising crude oil prices
- Nuclear war disrupting market fundamentals
6936 2018-05-09 13:43:37 And perhaps more importantly not being properly paid in royalties for the gas extracted & exported to that market by oil & gas majors. They enjoy best deals & minimum payment for upstream assets in Australia & then naturally export to highest priced buyers #ausenergy #auspol

6944 2018-05-09 13:43:21 I'm not arguing you point. But I keep wondering - NK's acting unusually. What's Russia paying them? It's a real possiblity. Media's so business with NK-by-the-experts, that they aren't even thinking of this. But Russia was caught passing oil to NK in violation of sanctions before

6953 2018-05-09 13:42:22 It's about regional hegemony from a global superpower who have the only nuclear powered ally in the region just waiting for the signal to attack. Oil is a big part of it but it's not the full story. Iran is the jewel in the crown if you remember the axis of evil speech.
6954 2018-05-09 13:42:20 You want higher gas prices?
You want China to invest more money into Iran and completely stop buying oil from Canada?
You want war in the middle east?
You want to screw over our real allies in Europe?

6970 2018-05-09 13:41:29 Authors of the bill giving farmers the ability to grow industrial hemp are meeting today with Dept. of Justice officials, after the agency warned in a recent memo the extraction and selling of CBD oil from those plants is still illegal under the new law.
6971 2018-05-09 13:41:25 Yes, that's high for us. Especially when there are several oil refineries in CA & gas is still more expensive then middle America. You would think it would be more, in middle AM, due to shipping costs. Compound the fact we have stagnant wages & high medical costs, it hits hard.
6972 2018-05-09 13:41:25 The only resources Russia has are: 
* Oil
* Mobsters

Both will do well in war.

6981 2018-05-09 13:40:54 I have been paying attention! That’s why I voted for Trump. I’ve felt for years that we had enough oil and other resources to take care of ourselves, now, finally a president who cares about the country is making this a reality. MAGA
6982 2018-05-09 13:40:53 American government wants their share from Iran oil,so if Iran is not doing so it's threat to the world and particularly USA

6984 2018-05-09 13:40:48 You can't have a coup if the head of the government remains the same. The US had no interest in Iranian oil (that was the Brits), and our interests were in preventing the spread of Communism (which destroyed countries) and solving the crisis quickly.

6999 2018-05-09 13:39:51 Trump made promises to big money people who will make money at the expense of common people.  Follow the money in oil and how much we will pay for gas.

7001 2018-05-09 13:39:41 Anyone know any light weight oil i can use for my scalp?
7002 2018-05-09 13:39:36 I’ve got the solution to the “ Iran” problem!!...I’ll run over to the nursing home, oil up the” Boys” walkers, & ship ‘em over to “Whack” that ayatollah guy!!...The rest of them will fall apart!!... BoY’S then take over!!( only thing left is getting Boys Back!!)
7003 2018-05-09 13:39:32 Do you work in coal or oil?
7004 2018-05-09 13:39:32 Seriously... If Britain and France were on board with us bombing Syria for no damn reason you don’t think they are going to support The U.S. taking oil from Iran??? It’s all about the $$$

7008 2018-05-09 13:39:08 Water, air, food problems are the worst. But even in other places, America's children are being robbed by our education system. Kids do not get back the years when they should be learning, while we feed companies like Big Pharm, banks, and oil extravagant corporate welfare.
7009 2018-05-09 13:39:07 What are your thoughts on oil prices?
7010 2018-05-09 13:39:03 They won because they brainwashed nation that the inflation and recession of the 70s was caused by Labour when it was global economic shock caused by OPEC OIL crisis and they used their bogeyman tactic with markets will crash if labour get in & the Sun fear front page.

7014 2018-05-09 13:38:44 You would think he would have explained his tought process, if he had one. I'm guessing he had just loaded up on oil stocks.
7015 2018-05-09 13:38:41 girl, spray on suave deodorant, specifically for sensitive skin (or baby powder scented), is a gem. also, mix about a tsp of tea tree oil w/ a tsp olive oil and apply with like a cotton ball right before bed. 
7016 2018-05-09 13:38:40 Will certainly be watching this tomorrow on BBC 2 at 9pm. It is our responsibility to  help protect these beautiful creatures and help raise awareness in the consequences of buying palm oil products. We need to insist on truly sustainable oil, deforestation-free.

7018 2018-05-09 13:38:32 Donald trump  your decision is correct if you have  evidence against  Iran. But you should also  keep a look on oil prices. It should  not increased more  than  80$ per barrel because it will effect the world economy.
7019 2018-05-09 13:38:30 They forget they were in League one not all that long ago. Either that or they are glory hunters who only got on board when the oil money started.

7022 2018-05-09 13:38:09 Not to mention the  oil pipeline went across Native land Endangering water supplies.  Comes first act was to allow them to continue their pipeline.
7023 2018-05-09 13:38:00 oil prices must be highhhhh 
7024 2018-05-09 13:37:59 Are ya'll really pretending that Trumps policies lead to higher oil prices?

Trump is pro-drilling, pipelines, offshore, opening ANWAR. All these increase oil supply which will lead to lower prices.

Democrats policy is to wipe out all US oil production and use windmills.
7025 2018-05-09 13:37:58 I feel like it’s Greek Orthodox which is bizarre I’ve had my kids baptized they just get oil sprinkled on their head.
7026 2018-05-09 13:37:55 Happy with a note with our first day to DC talking to ASCO, which collapsed along with oil prices?

7029 2018-05-09 13:37:46 He likely dipped into his wife's Oil of Olay 'Ageless' line of products.  I'm enjoying imagining what the celebrations might include in the 150s . . .
7030 2018-05-09 13:37:42 I hope your rich because the oil price will raise again. Iran will join brics we are not in a good position.
7031 2018-05-09 13:37:39 Except he has just contacted Saudi et al to get them to produce more oil in violation of OPEC quotas to make up for the Iranian oil lost to sanctions. Which makes Saudi et al happy.
7032 2018-05-09 13:37:32 はい！大好きでございます！！！！（あのラフを思い出しながら）
7033 2018-05-09 13:37:31 You literally replied to a tweet where I said the regime should use money from oil sales to invest in their people. Not sure how that is a stealing of resources.
7034 2018-05-09 13:37:17 5/? I had people who had oil back up from ground water about 2 ft in basement and they had to move out because of smell.They did this and moved back in the next day.Hope this helps someone.

This centre is of critical importance to the oil & gas industry & diver training. I wish it well for the future
7036 2018-05-09 13:37:07 Oil was $10 a barrel back then....Denver suffered same fate as Calgary....tell the whole story!
7037 2018-05-09 13:37:07 So...MAGAts didn't really mean it when they attacked Hillary as a war hawk? They really want more Americans dying for oil & Death Merchants in the Middle East? 

We knew that.

7040 2018-05-09 13:36:51 US focuses on crude. Turkey in 2012 pushed for a waiver and TUPRAS had to decrease Iranian oil refined inside turkey. Nat gas was about payments. OFAC mentioned the heavy metal sanctions (Turkey & gold) as coming back online in 90 days (if Im remembering correctly)
7041 2018-05-09 13:36:45 Er! Energy production is supposed to be an efficient industry, as its a 'raw materials' supplier to the whole economy. How can you not understand that basic concept? More people (than coal/oil/gas) = higher cost = less efficient.
7042 2018-05-09 13:36:42 What's the price of oil today? #FollowTheMoney
7043 2018-05-09 13:36:41 Futures hit 13+ and taled off since...as bonds ripped, oil rip, many commodities with dollar ...and the warnings around the world hace started...Italy, Argentina, turkey etc etc etc. This open is technical ...macro says otherwise...we will see when the vol drops around 21min
7044 2018-05-09 13:36:38 Poor peoples of the world who have become forced victims, due to oil price increase pressure, because of one man’s decision on the Iran deal???
7045 2018-05-09 13:36:33 That and higher oil prices. Gifyting Russia and Saudi
7046 2018-05-09 13:36:32 So it's stupid of oil companies to go offline for maintenance? Did you read the article? The current spike in prices is about demand. Since TM wasn't going to be delivering product until December 2019, and since BC already had a carbon tax, this spike is mostly about supply.
7047 2018-05-09 13:36:27 Oil price up...Brent crude adds over $2 a barrel on prospect of reduced ss from Iran via BBC
7048 2018-05-09 13:36:20 $TSLA oil is going through the Roof and 20% of the US just said they would consider buying an EV! Good Luck Shorts! Bad Timing!

7051 2018-05-09 13:36:08 Trump’s decision on Iran described on local NPR news in Houston as “good for US drillers” since oil prices likely to rise. Despite the folly, no doubt this is going to prove popular.
7052 2018-05-09 13:36:06 I recommend it... about 2:1 coconut oil to butter, and make sure you blend it
7053 2018-05-09 13:36:00 The play book is to make oil investors richer by making this decision. It would be worthy of examination to see who was told about this decision in advance and how their stock portfolio was adjusted in order to profit.
7054 2018-05-09 13:35:58 Yes, Mike. I’ve negotiated a lot of international win-win deals. I’m not afraid of diplomacy.  Simply being a general does not make one an expert on Iran. Trump has succeeded once again in aligning the entire world against us except Israel & 2 countries that sell us a lot of oil.
7055 2018-05-09 13:35:48 $200 per barrel we can expectCan’t help  if Pre. Trump is under manipulation 
Jobs and walls are nothing, the oil price is real!
7056 2018-05-09 13:35:43 3/? Go to building supply store and get bag of powdered cement sprinkle it all over the floor and beams.Let it sit over night and shop vac the powder up.The lime will draw any oil or smell out of cement floor.

7058 2018-05-09 13:35:32 33% of all exported oil from Middle East passes through Straits of Hormuz, which Iran borders. Iran deal was put in place to prevent development of weapons grade uranium while allowing for nuclear energy development after 15 years.
7059 2018-05-09 13:35:26 If the EU manages to stay in the deal, then nothing will really change.  For us its a loss of face. Iran will sell its oil to Russia and the EU and Iran will be able to purchase goods from EU companies instead of ours. If the EU can't work it. Oil will $100 by end of summer.
7060 2018-05-09 13:35:18 Where is Congress?!!! They should be all over these oil prices. I thought we were drilling a glut of oil here. If we need more refineries than deal with it! Stop sending our oil elsewhere. We should be self-sufficient by now!
7061 2018-05-09 13:35:16 Iranian politicians torched a US flag and chanted "Death to America" in an angry demonstration after #Twitler Trump withdrew from a nuclear deal. Nearly enough for the USA to go in and 'liberate' their oil reserve

7067 2018-05-09 13:34:58 10 year note above 3% you want to be in $BAC. Oil rallying you want to be $GE don't forget they own Baker Hughes now.
7068 2018-05-09 13:34:49 He knows the pricing of some of them because when he asked me if I knew how much a barrel of oil is, I said $70 and his eyes LIT UP
7069 2018-05-09 13:34:42 And that’s just for starters.  This is an international criminal operation that is deep and dark.  I want to see the Koch brothers go down for bribery and perhaps carving up the oil and gas industry with Russian oligarchs directly connected to Putin.

7072 2018-05-09 13:34:27 Well Iran wants us to withdraw so they try bullying the world into what they want..what we really need is to be oil independent..than they couldn't bully us

7075 2018-05-09 13:34:03 Well, it would be nice to think trump was smart enough to have some big master plan, but looking at his life up til now, it is all about the money. Money and oil and Russia's motives are the same. Oil. The pattern has been there all along, Exxon, Tillerson, etc. Follow the money.
7076 2018-05-09 13:34:03 Saudi Arabia welcomed Trump's decision to withdraw from the nuclear agreement with Iran. Meanwhile an OPEC source said: "People shouldn’t take it for granted that Saudi Arabia will produce more oil single-handedly", according to Reuters.
7077 2018-05-09 13:33:59 continue to be amazed at how wrong people are on oil 75% off the lows.  oils move is not a simple story of Iran and Saudi IPO.  Industry has balanced supply.demand as well as stopped chasing growth at all costs.  Lack of investment/capex will also be meaningful for supply impact
7078 2018-05-09 13:33:56 We have our own oil dont we?
7079 2018-05-09 13:33:49 I don’t think so oil money used to fund terror and prop up bad Gov. Put America first not your Globalist partners. America will be trusted again by having moral compass unlike selling Uranium and tech to countries that hate America
7080 2018-05-09 13:33:49 Petrol Prices are now direclt linked with the global crude oil prices which fluctuates as per market demand and supply, however despite the current rise in global crude oil prices indian oil marketing companies didnt passed it to the consumers. #BJP

7085 2018-05-09 13:32:57 Yes, changes in season often effects the skin and skincare needs adjustment too. Eg. If skin gets dehydrated due to Central heating it will produce more oil... Causing acne. #womensinspire #asktheexpert

7097 2018-05-09 13:31:43 The bulk of Iran's oil (approx. 2.5 million barrels per day of production) is sold to China, India, and Turkey, all who are widely expected to ignore U.S. sanctions. Gavekal notes the sanctions are unlikely to have a decisive impact on global supply/demand for crude.
7098 2018-05-09 13:31:27 Hey @realdonaldtrump the 3 dollar a week increase I saw from your tax plan went to higher gas prices.  I guess you big oil buddies are taking in the money.  Way to #fuck regular #Americans.  #impeachtrump #drainthetrumpswamp

7123 2018-05-09 13:30:07 Coincidence that trump pulling US out of Iran deal jacks up oil prices benefitting Russian oil oligarchs & Putin? I think not.
7124 2018-05-09 13:29:52 That’s what I use & olive & coconut oil. I am off dairy but love it. I would use butter but my daughter (AKA Miss Goody 2 Shoes) would see it and then never shut up! 
7125 2018-05-09 13:29:51 Yes,a small percentage compared to Saudi,US,UAE and Russia. Your emplying it's due to oil when it has nothing to do with Oil. Iran not in the Top 5 of oil producers.
7126 2018-05-09 13:29:39 CA regulation (summer blend gas) is driving up gas prices this month. Fluctuations in OPEC production. High taxes. California has all but shut down oil production. Increase production, lower prices. Not that hard folks.

7133 2018-05-09 13:29:21 Now With Pulling Out of The JPCOA IRAN Deal---- The Money Grab is About To Get REAL BIG... OIL WILL RISE AGAIN TO $ 120.00 PLUS A BARREL..
7134 2018-05-09 13:29:20 @realDonaldTrump You are doing great.  I and my family fully support you. 
We need to increase domestic oil production and stop the speculating that is going on and raising gas prices.
7135 2018-05-09 13:29:16 #Markets notables so far this 
 morning include:
 2.5% rise in #oil prices due to higher possibility of #Iran supply disruption
 Firmer #stocks, with #traders viewing yesterday's Iran announcement as part of a "multi-round" process
 Quiet reaction to 3% for US government #bonds

7140 2018-05-09 13:28:41 Let me piss into the wind - did the prices go up?  Do we even receive any OIL FROM IRAN?  Zippo...then what is the problem? GREED.
7141 2018-05-09 13:28:36 alarm went off but it always does so I walked to turn it off but started choking on smoke as soon as I opened living room door so I ran into my kitchen and it was on fire but I accidentally left a hob on full and 2 pans of oil on top I tried putting it out but couldnt
7142 2018-05-09 13:28:32 My two-bit sense is that it started with oil, now it’s a grudge

7146 2018-05-09 13:28:22 >money to russia
I thought we got oil from the me, now its russia?
7147 2018-05-09 13:28:22 Stranding our oil does nothing to decrease global demand. We produce ~5-6% of the world’s oil and that demand can easily be filled by other nations. Blocking  oil is like trying to block a river with a fish net.
7148 2018-05-09 13:28:16 Lmao. How you sabi, na oil oh. Joints are dry

7153 2018-05-09 13:27:38 Nifty gained almost 8% from its recent low; while USDINR too gained more than 6% in same time frame.

Crude Oil too gained more than 8% in same time frame.

Where is correlation???

Should we be ready for some move in Indian Markets due to Global as well Domestic developments?
7154 2018-05-09 13:27:35 That was definitely worth 150 billion in cash. Somehow I don’t think the goal was nonproliferation, prolly Iranian oil to Europe. Jmtc.
7155 2018-05-09 13:27:35 If you mix am plus some palm oil then add some keta school boys you kill them that
7156 2018-05-09 13:27:21 Brent oil price rose nearly to $77/barrel today, highest since late 2014. Immediate impact of Trump's withdrawal from the Iran agreement, helping all authoritarian oil states.
7157 2018-05-09 13:27:15 60% of Russia’s economy is based on energy. Mainly gas/oil. The very idea of even pulling out of this arrangements will cause instability in oil prices and automatically increase prices per barrel immediately. For starters. Not to mention, well... facts. History. Etc etc.
7158 2018-05-09 13:27:13 Sir pls compare between Crude oil prices pre 2014 with current prices.N then justify the current Government.Try Sir
7159 2018-05-09 13:27:10 @realDonaldTrump He is doing this on purpose to start a war and take over the oil fields.

7161 2018-05-09 13:27:07 @realDonaldTrump OBAMA PAID IRAN  WITH OUR TAX MONEY  TO HAVE AMERICA WIPED OUT. SHOULD BE A LAW AGAINST THAT. NOW  AMERICA GAIN'S ANOTHER FOO TO WATCH  LOST BILLIONS  AND OIL IS GOING TO SKY-ROCKET. OBAMA IS A COLLABORATOR WITH IRAN TO UNDER MINE  U S A.
7162 2018-05-09 13:27:04 True, and it could bring him down first. Already the cancellation of #IranDeal backfiring. Boeing lost their large contract with Iran, #GE will be kicked out, oil prices are headed higher.This cld real hurt rich #Republicans. The #stockMarket cld fall
7163 2018-05-09 13:26:58 Putin is very happy with Little Dick Donny.  He owns oil companies.
7164 2018-05-09 13:26:51 Make the most of it. I suspect the next 2-3 years will see Oil back below 30.....

7166 2018-05-09 13:26:44 One way to know your oil change is done is when your music stops playing through your headphones as you’re sitting in the mechanic office and displays the “Connected to Car Multimedia” message  #oops
7167 2018-05-09 13:26:43 Oil prices have jumped to 3 1/2-year highs!
7168 2018-05-09 13:26:36 I visited Iran quite frequently around the Millennium on business for Shell. Was told we had an advantage over US Oil companies because US Government wouldn’t let them do business there. Same again ?
7169 2018-05-09 13:26:34 After US withdrew from JCPOA, there is a lot of thinking and actions to be taken by New delhi e.g:-
1. Iran being 3rd biggest oil supplier to  will this effect us.
2. Can USA break any bilateral agreements with .
3. Further trade with Iran may deem us Anti-USA.

7170 2018-05-09 13:26:22 nossa querida Petr esta defasada nao só contra o Oil, mas tb contra outras petroliferas !

Por outro lado, segurou bem contra a queda do IBOV.

Papel tem bastante potencial !
7171 2018-05-09 13:26:22 It’s really looking like that, isn’t it?

Oddly enough, I think I’d feel better if he had done it in order to reimpose sanctions in order to help  with oil prices.
7172 2018-05-09 13:26:19 Umm.. how about you sillybilly britnats, accept Every country on Earth (maybe bar another oil rich country, Norway) has a deficit. Your fellow earthings have. Deficit the norm. No biggie.
7173 2018-05-09 13:26:16 Torture,crisis in the Middle East,higher oil prices. Welcome to the 2003!
7174 2018-05-09 13:26:11 Not necessarily oil, but consumers who want to move money out.
7175 2018-05-09 13:26:04 Poor Iranians if only they knew this is the same BS that happens when the US starts another war. The happiest people are the warmongers and Oil companies salivating getting their hands on Iranian oil again.
7176 2018-05-09 13:25:57 Also, high oil prices line pockets.
7177 2018-05-09 13:25:54 the EU is blind and will do anything for the Iran Oil and banking access

7179 2018-05-09 13:25:45 most of his promises were bad, illegal or war crimes. promised to execute entire families of criminals, Take Iraq oil, deport 11 million Day 1 and bring back torture. Which he endorsed again yesterday in Tweet. Scary considering at same time trying to get 3 hostages from NK.

7181 2018-05-09 13:25:32 Isolationist foreign policy, whether it be trade policy or diplomacy, doesn't work in a globalized world.  Plus don't be surprised if the price of Oil worldwide increases.
7182 2018-05-09 13:25:20 Oil falls????  In 180 days, there is going to be 5% of the world's oil restricted or off the market.
7183 2018-05-09 13:25:19 He's using Syria and Isis to destabilize the Middle East and help Putin's oil money War machine. Everything you said is true @BobSMueller   needs to pull the plug on the sewer the sooner the better, he can go back for the rest of the swamp.
7184 2018-05-09 13:25:07 Ummm. Uneducated comment. USA never took oil from Yemen. Mindless parrot, stay off Twitter, you're embarrassing yourself.

7189 2018-05-09 13:24:56 Yeah I have been reading that all over. Now we know why he pulled out, to help his friends in the oil industry.
7190 2018-05-09 13:24:52 やったぁぁぁぁぁ！
7191 2018-05-09 13:24:50 Your comment is every bit as stupid as saying "If I never check my engine oil, I'll be safe from engine failure!!!"
7192 2018-05-09 13:24:48 His decision raises the risk of deepening conflicts in the Middle East, puts the United States at odds with European diplomatic and business interests, and casts uncertainty over global oil supplies. Oil prices rose more than 2 percent on Wednesday  .huffingtonpost.com/entry/iran
7193 2018-05-09 13:24:44 Operation AJAX 1953 removes democratically elected prime minister for what? Some oil.

7195 2018-05-09 13:24:41 So everyone of the top 5 oil greedy countries opposed the deal. Well no surprises there.

US has given 180 days for allies to remove themselves from any Iran oil deals 
U.S. will keep close track of Iranian crude purchases during that period

7202 2018-05-09 13:24:03 Iran has dropped the sale of oil for dollars , they want gold as payment for oil.  
That is against US interests, unless they except dollars there will be war .

7209 2018-05-09 13:23:25 Was on Deciem because Beautylish ran out of my glycolic acid toner. I also ended up getting hyaluronic acid (needed some more anyway), serum foundation and rosehip oil. I wanted to try the rosehip oil because my kora rosehip oil is running out and too expensive.

7216 2018-05-09 13:23:10 Question: 
Who takes CBD oil and has experience with it? Thinking about it for my friend who is in hospital.  I have always liked natural therapies and think they can be much better than regular medicine.
7217 2018-05-09 13:23:03 So what happens when you drop nuclear bombs onto oil fields? Would we live long enough to find out? (Asking for 7 billion friends.) #IranDeal

7218 2018-05-09 13:23:03 For #TeacherAppreciationDay I won a gift card to Outback Steakhouse (my favorite restaurant) courtesy of @EaglesHLHS !! My students almost picked a free hair cut and and an oil change for me, and I love my students but I do both myself, so close call 
7219 2018-05-09 13:22:59 Russia happier with each increase in oil and gas.
7220 2018-05-09 13:22:54 #BrentCrude spikes to over $77 per barrel upon #POTUS' announcement to pull out of #IranNuclearDeal .  Oil prices have gone up $30 per barrel in the last year. Expect gas prices to be HIGH this summer!
7221 2018-05-09 13:22:50 Like it was a hoax when Alex Jones' attorney claimed that his entire shit show is all a persona act to pitch a snake oil scam? Tabloids Journalism!!!
7222 2018-05-09 13:22:46 That is one of the reasons that Shitler scrapped the deal. Now American oil billionaires can make even more money.
7223 2018-05-09 13:22:33 So, they can't generate electricity with oil?

7226 2018-05-09 13:22:06 This feels strangely like deja vu. George Bush trumped up "evidence" that Iraq was stockpiling weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons. Upon invasion the first building secure was the ministry of oil. Why the very different approach to Iran than N. Korea? Oil?
7227 2018-05-09 13:22:03 Yep. And that's in history books that are actually reputable. Wikipedia is just a quick, easy lookup. A foreign country is figuratively sodomized over oil profits and for no other reason.

How very American...

7236 2018-05-09 13:21:38 I am sure your cronies in the oil companies will be pleased to be able to raise gasoline prices. Once again, average Americans take it on the chin, while you and the rest of the rich soak up the gains.

7249 2018-05-09 13:20:35 Prices of patrol and Diesel are not fluctuating since two weeks app. As earlier why?  Is there no change in crude prices ,or govt. told oil co
not to increase further.
7250 2018-05-09 13:20:00 Very true. Every move he & the Saudis and Israel make generate money for energy, oil, security & the war machine/military industrial complex. It's collectively the world's largest business and money maker.  These countries and their leaders are simply pawns on the chessboard
7251 2018-05-09 13:19:59 He never signed off on the sanctions. He’s taking money from Ogliarchs. Breaking your countries word of honour on Paris and Iran so Russians get more money for oil and he gets more money from Russia.
7252 2018-05-09 13:19:57 I wonder if Russia will see any benefit if the world oil prices skyrocket??  <— sarcasm
7253 2018-05-09 13:19:48 I'm not surprised you're so absolutely accurate... Saudi Arabia and the Oil for favours justice goes through the window they play a game of chess have a fantastic day

7265 2018-05-09 13:18:52 Very little oil coming fm Iran. If costs go up, more likely cuz demand going up due to ppl traveling more over summer & better economy! Please try to be honest abt this! When u present only one side, word gets around & u r discredited! I WAS a Dem—party left me! Crazy positions!
7266 2018-05-09 13:18:49 Oh look, oil prices went up. Wonder what spurred that on.
7267 2018-05-09 13:18:48 Well I do have physical therapy tomorrow so while the sky opens up today I'm gonna clean and oil all my guns. That should burn 8 hrs.But it's a labor of love so it's still relaxing. If the storms make me to tired I'll just curl up with my guns and take a nap.
7268 2018-05-09 13:18:44 The issue isn't about nuclear stuff or oil or sanctions @vali_nasr @jrezaian It's about buffer states to make @netanyahu Israel feel safe...
7269 2018-05-09 13:18:31 Indian Rupee weakened to a fresh 15-month low against the US dollar, tracking losses in Asian currencies amid continued outflows from local assets and elevated crude oil prices. The Rupee ended at ~67.26 vs yesterday’s close of 67.08.
7270 2018-05-09 13:18:31 $77 - hmm. That's quite high. We should be worried - volatility and all that. But don't panic -  there's really nothing to worry about at all since not a single penny of Scotland's mahoosive oil wealth comes to Scotland. It's all 'ex-regio' & thus goes straight to HM Treasury.
7271 2018-05-09 13:18:29 Looks like this was done so his friends in the oil industry could make more money. I have been seeing articles that pulling out is going to raise gas prices even further.

7273 2018-05-09 13:18:23 Indian government bonds ended lower today on surging crude oil prices. Rising oil prices have sparked fears of RBI rate hike in June. The yield on 10-year G-sec ended at 7.71% vs. yesterday’s close of 7.58%.

7275 2018-05-09 13:18:14 What are you babbling about again? The cost of oil has increased and you’ve basically put us in harms way because you need a war to take the heat off your money laundering schemes. The rich is doing great, working class? Not so much. Tweet less idiot.

7294 2018-05-09 13:16:49 @KMJNOW why isn't anyone talking about how much oil in% do we import form Iran? Prices going up sounds like profiteering to me. Why do we export, then import oil, kinda sounds like profiteering to me too. Future news story? Just sayin.
7295 2018-05-09 13:16:37 Yea, and that was an orchestrated war with a goal of controlling the flow of oil.

7297 2018-05-09 13:16:27 We had past experience of Iraq war and oil price boom. Withdrawal of agreement is an excuse for attacking Iran. Israel may be beneficial,  but other countries have to pay a price. India love Israel coz of many reasons, but a oil price turmoil in our land, would be colossal

7309 2018-05-09 13:15:42 This "deal" was just another example of Obama's theory of distribution of wealth. Give Iran lots of cash and reduce sanctions so they could sell more oil. EU gets to sell to them, and Obama constrains US.

7334 2018-05-09 13:14:32 Yes I find a concern in this discussion,the future of palm oil workers.We are talking about the exploitation of natural resources and there is no question of it.If you have good Strategy on leading country into  developing then you won't exploit resources but its all mafia's work
7335 2018-05-09 13:14:30 Please address how this will affect oil prices.

7338 2018-05-09 13:14:26 indeed - v  good point. For at least one of them, they've have pretty much admitted they are a "gas & oil" firm and that the future is gas.

7344 2018-05-09 13:14:02 This takes about 1.5 million barrels of oil per day out of the market.
As in most of these decisions it all about money. Expect gas prices to rise.
7345 2018-05-09 13:14:00 Blended roasted red peppers & olive oil. They really were excellent.
7346 2018-05-09 13:13:58 Russia may be the winner as oil prices rise. Trump is not smart enough to see that  He has made the US a rough nation whose word is now meaningless. Look at the nations not in the Paris,TPP and Iranian deals. What terrible company we're in.
7347 2018-05-09 13:13:55 Solar and wind are backed up by coal, gas and oil; the  is a metaphor, for the well documented intentions of the oil industry to replace nuclear with renewables so they backed up with fossil fuels and make more profits burning for energy

7353 2018-05-09 13:13:35 Holy shirt all's, Batman.  You should be scared out of your drawers today.  500,000 to what, put sanctions on Iran so Putin makes more on oil?  While Americans pay tons more?  Money from AT& T into Cohen's account ..for Time Warner merger?  Mueller owns you!
7354 2018-05-09 13:13:22 Peak winter is about 55 low at 40. Summer low say 28 high 40. Oil refineries are negligible.
7355 2018-05-09 13:13:19 yeah, after he gave Putin all the oil through Iran. For God sakes people. You think Kim and Putin aren't pulling Trumps strings. They are both looking better and stronger and America is looking worse and weaker.

7365 2018-05-09 13:12:44 Sorry @Boeing Trump has to give an assist to Putin and Abramovich, they need to sell off their oil at a higher price. Those luxury super yachts are pricey

7367 2018-05-09 13:12:42 Yea, maybe if the rest of the world didn't turn a blind eye to the bs that Saudi Arabia gets away with (oil/money > human rights) we could have been rid of those institutions. Then again I live in the US, not any of those countries. I wonder if there's a reason for it.
7368 2018-05-09 13:12:41 Another stupid Nat who cites Norway as the land of milk and honey.   They might have had an oil fund and what?  Oil in the UK was used to keep taxes low.  
Norway has food banks.  These idiots spout this rubbish relentlessly.  it’s just tiresome.

7388 2018-05-09 13:11:49 @jiffylube attendant just told me that if you don’t change conventional oil ever 3000 miles (I do it every 5000 with normal driving) it will “mess your engine up”.  I wonder if he truly believes that nonsense or if he was told to say that to up sell to synthetic.
7389 2018-05-09 13:11:46 I'm wondering if anyone in #EnergyTwitter might have time series data on overlap of ownership between coal (or oil) and nuclear industries in US? Canada? Canada and US?
7390 2018-05-09 13:11:45 Spineless foriegn policy. Sanctions on Iran is going to impact India a lot. No more Iranian oil and limbo mode for the much touted chabbar port.
7391 2018-05-09 13:11:42 One frustrating thing I’ve noticed with both the S3 and the M235i is the lack of oil & H20 temp gauges. In S3 the oil temp is on the track screen only and in the M there’s a 5-step process to get a glimpse at it. No H20 temp options at all. Very odd choice for performance cars.

7418 2018-05-09 13:09:57 Its mostly like about Oil and all the geographic benefits Iran has... its a dirty political lie to start a war bcuz of "Atom program" ... Trump is a jerk anyways.... a racist ugly old ass turd

7420 2018-05-09 13:09:37 And yet some Americans were celebrating the very temporary drop in oil prices yesterday as if their president had done something great for them. What do those same ppl have to say now??  #fools

7466 2018-05-09 13:05:39 That's the point, right... Russia makes their money by oil and gas... taking Iran out of the market will keep prices higher.  We know who's trump master, and its not us, "we the people", but Putin.

7480 2018-05-09 13:04:35 Israel, Saudi Arabia, and America want this war for the following reasons: 1. To raise the price of oil. 2. To steal Iran's resources. 3. Because Iran dumped the US Dollar (currency domination for our banks) Looks like it's time for regime change in America.

7486 2018-05-09 13:04:20 50 yrs ago there was a democratically elected president of Iran ... and a secular, well educated country was about to boom from oil production. And we fucked all that up for them. And helped them get a headliner Muslim cleric, a US puppet, into power to get our hands on their oil

Lastly, other than war, what other options are on the table. Oh, Russia gets stronger because of increased oil prices.

7503 2018-05-09 13:02:49 So I asked my brother to change my oil, lazy ass pushed it off for 4 days I bother him about it and he says (ONCE AGAIN) “I’ll do it tomorrow before you go to work” here we are before I’m about to go to work, he isn’t out of bed yet
7504 2018-05-09 13:02:43 Trump pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal has sent crude prices rocketing higher, taking oil stocks up with it

Europe's oil stocks index has just hit its highest level since September 2014, up 2% and looks like its catching up with crude prices

10x a lot for this.

7525 2018-05-09 13:01:24 Manchin is a hot mess on oil & coal. He’s from an oil & coal state. He may vote down bills regulating them, but he at least would be pressured into cloture by his caucus,which puts the bill to the floor for an up/down vote. All those moderates, for cloture alone, can’t be purged

7537 2018-05-09 13:00:36 Madam/Sir, you should basically go after foods imported from GM producing countries. With corn, soy, canola, cotton oil, squash contents. It is actually relatively pretty doable. We are waiting for action of course.

7541 2018-05-09 13:00:28 You and your party have destroyed Alberta. With oil prices at $70.00 the province should be roaring with activities and we shouldn't be in so much debt. Please just call an election so Alberta can get back to work!

7546 2018-05-09 12:59:57 Trump's decisions are always profit based. How will his unilateral threat to overthrow Iran's govt enable him to line his pockets? Arms deals, Oil,  precious metals? Follow the money.

7552 2018-05-09 12:59:42 Interest for war in ME. Natural resources like Oil, corporate interests like weapon production. Nothing new from 1950 up to 2018. Just less education, more work stress and more debt for ordinary people. Standart elites agenda. I think you know better 
7553 2018-05-09 12:59:32 If you suffer from this yellow dust, I highly recommend you start taking a tablespoon of good tasting (some is nasty tasting) coconut oil every day for as long as u live here. It eventually makes a huge difference. It has for me!

7556 2018-05-09 12:59:21 You’re wrong Glenn, & most pundits seem to be missing this: oil prices will now rise even faster, benefiting every autocrat & demagogue, no one more than Putin himself.

7559 2018-05-09 12:59:18 You can't use reason for people who are driven by feelings and emotions. Just as you put out an oil fire by using a bigger fire to consume the oxygen Trump understands that you defeat liberals by stoking the fires and causing them to emotionally explode.

7564 2018-05-09 12:58:58 I guess you need to pull the injectors and crank the engine over for a while to get the oil out of the cylinders. Otherwise, any cranking and you get hydrostatic lock. Whoops!

7574 2018-05-09 12:57:54 Not really, oil is such a volatile commodity that any company NOT building a buffer factor into their pricing structure is self harming to the point of stupidity

7576 2018-05-09 12:57:43 a heck of a lot better  than wooden barricades , remember when they had "cannon balls" of oil to light up at night?
7577 2018-05-09 12:57:34 Prices increase mainly because demand is higher. But without the oil coming in from Iran, oil prices will surge. Where the national average was supposed to hit $2.80 this summer, I would now expect it closer to $3.50, if not higher.
7578 2018-05-09 12:57:31 At $26, companies stop drilling for oil. At $70.50, they'll explore in your back yard (on a lease). #diversify
7579 2018-05-09 12:57:27 mmm that's a lot of oil! doesn't do well for your skin!!
7580 2018-05-09 12:57:24 Oil prices are up 50% over the past year and 17% YTD to $76/bbl Brent on a steadily tightening supply-demand balance and rising geopolitical risk centered on the Middle East, with Trump’s decision to re-enact sanctions only fueling additional price momentum to the upside.

Iran was also compliant with the deal. Sometimes we have to do what’s best for the world and not flex our Dick size
7584 2018-05-09 12:57:02 Apparently you're not understanding the topic. 2009 oil prices had zero to do with Iran. Venezuela is not Iran
7585 2018-05-09 12:57:01 I realize that as the price of oil futures rise so does the price of gas. The more unstable the ME is the higher the price for oil. The price rise yesterday was in anticipation of increased instability.

7587 2018-05-09 12:56:56 The European angst over @POTUS withdrawing from the #IranDeal is fundamentally financial. Loss of investment opportunities and higher oil prices.
7588 2018-05-09 12:56:53 Price of oil is going up.

7648 2018-05-09 12:52:31 What the Hell is wrong with you? Pretty clear- Trump's just helping Putin raise oil prices.

7664 2018-05-09 12:51:15 I think he meant positive promises, he also promised to execute entire families of criminals, endorsed torturing hostages, sick considering 3 hostages were in NK, but thank God NK did not agree with Trump on torture, take Iraq oil, so many war crime promises
7665 2018-05-09 12:51:13 Trump is lighting a match to all of the oil in the Middle East. Just fulfilling a campaign pledge. He going to take the oil out.

7677 2018-05-09 12:50:10 Probably. The big question is - will equities catch up to the oil price or vice versa?
7678 2018-05-09 12:49:54 Estimates for such costs range between $2.50 to $7 a barrel for water trucking, and disposal can cost about $1 a barrel. In the Delaware basin, one of the most prolific sub-regions in the Permian, operators generally produce five barrels of water for every barrel of oil
7679 2018-05-09 12:49:48 Look at the comparisons, in the past we wouldnt even talk about Man City. Now they are competing with us in trophies, plus you cant really count the early years of oil money because they were building up. Now they are dominating. We have been in their shadow for the past 4 years.

Do you think that England wouldn’t cheat or deny Independence to Scotland? Would they go to War to keep us?

7695 2018-05-09 12:48:04 America sided with Iran against the British wrt oil claims, and supported the return of an exiled Shah once Mossadegh began grasping for dictatorial powers and running Iran into poverty.  Americans sided with Iranian people when they protested for the Shah's return.
7696 2018-05-09 12:47:50 There is no oil. It all dried up at the prospect of an independent Scotland. Don't you remember?

7707 2018-05-09 12:46:55 The cost of extracting oil in the newer fields is falling, the price going up means higher profit, meaning more tax revenue and better job security for those remaining in the industry
7708 2018-05-09 12:46:52 @MorningsMaria  ask the president to open up the oil reserves to help ease the price of gas. West coast is at $3.25  and climbing. There goes our tax stimulus, which is being chewed up at the pumps.

7710 2018-05-09 12:46:46 Um... dude... you should really read a history book.  There were 2500 years of uninterrupted monarchy prior to the Iranian revolution.  The US backed the Shah who did terrible things like: freeing serfs, made mandatory paid sick-leave, nationalized the British controlled oil
7711 2018-05-09 12:46:38 NK releases the three "detainees" hostages and that's a good thing,but why do US citizens go there in the first place? And since the Iran deal is now history wouldn't it be a possibility for NK to deal with Iran for oil and gas and nukes!!

7715 2018-05-09 12:46:08 Lack of access to a crude slate that produces mid-distillates. Caused by decreasing prod from PdVSA, Mexico, and outflow constriction from Canada.  As well, it might be a strategic move by OPEC+ to adjust its sales to force the US to use more of  its domestic oil production.

7719 2018-05-09 12:45:35 One of the most effective Obama policies was to up U.S. production of oil (we were #1 for a stack of years), while promoting energy independence policies for countries dependent on Russian natural gas. Then, ExxonMobil and Russia took over the government with a puppet President.

7725 2018-05-09 12:45:17 Trump can't lift sanctions so he is doing everything he can to raise oil prices. Arguably more beneficial for Russia. This is all about money. Republicans are complicit. The money Russia is tossing around is too big for small results.

7732 2018-05-09 12:44:49 Addressing the Russian Parliament following his inauguration, Vladimir Putin called for the “unburdening” Russia’s economy from the  dangerous monopoly of the US dollar in the pricing of oil in global  commodities markets.
7733 2018-05-09 12:44:48 out of interest, why do you interpret oil being up 2.5% as a good day at the office? you own a lot of it?
7734 2018-05-09 12:44:45 Because WE pulled out of the agreement. Zero leverage in the ME for the USA. I think trump wants a war to steal their oil to make his wealthy Russians more wealthy.

7764 2018-05-09 12:42:38 Creo q todo es una x una cosa llamada geopolitica debido al proceso de desacuerdo de EEUU en la retirada del TNPN con Iran repercute en que haya menos oil en el mercado y suba los precios entre otros factores....

It is rich that we're screaming at Iran to become a liberalized secular democracy when the CIA stopped that the last time tho.

7783 2018-05-09 12:41:23 I guess all the oil being exported from the U. S. Will now remain here, right?

7785 2018-05-09 12:41:14 No... not at all. Snake oil is one of their chief products, certainly.  But it's found in many products these days.
7786 2018-05-09 12:41:11 I remember seeing an article 20 yrs ago that estimated a barrel of oil is actually subsidized 20% more cost when considering what our military needs to spend to secure gulf region/China has Trade surplus wth us but wth every weapon thy have built the USA has 2 spend 2 counter
7787 2018-05-09 12:41:08 So basically France an uk want Iran deal so they can get there oil cheaper in stead of putting a stop to a nuclear Iran really cmon man
7788 2018-05-09 12:40:49 Usd,oil,?
7789 2018-05-09 12:40:44 possible explanation would be higher oil => driving higher inflation expectations

7795 2018-05-09 12:40:13 Bullshit.  It means nothing.  What is affecting prices is the intentional reduction in production by a group of countries.  Stop spreading fake news.  You know that the major contributor to this current state of oil affairs is an intentional act by member nations.

7804 2018-05-09 12:39:48 You realize by allowing them to sell oil, this crippled much of the Middle East’s ability to sponsor terrorism. The economics of this deal were far more important. The only country that is helped by #IranDealWithdrawal is Russia and price per barrel.

7809 2018-05-09 12:39:32 So now we have a new unholy alliance, Saudi Arabia, Israel and #Trump. Oil makes money. War makes money. #Trump is incompetent and a crook.

7812 2018-05-09 12:39:25 The Catalonia argument for independence i.e. "we work really hard and pay loads of taxes so our revenues subsidise the rest of Spain and it's not fair", seems much more elegant than "we want to sit on our fat asses and profit from oil secured by a recent maritime treaty"
7813 2018-05-09 12:39:17 THE SAUDIES GET RICHER AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE GET POORER.  WHY DO WE MAKE THEM RICHER WHEN WE HAVE SO MUCH EXCESS OIL?  UNACCEPTABLE.

7815 2018-05-09 12:39:13 Peak winter demand is close to 45GW. At night it drops to below 30GW, which includes a lot of oil refineries buying at cheap rate.
7816 2018-05-09 12:39:02 Cash for Terrorists with Oil sales from Iran. Maybe Venezuela can start selling oil to help their economy.
7817 2018-05-09 12:38:59 So basically France and I’m want Iran deal only so they can get there oil cheaper basicly saying screw the people over fears of a full fledged nuclear Iran nice
7818 2018-05-09 12:38:56 Oh, do I remember someone with hideous hair promising to repeal Obamacare? Oh, what happened? Wasn't that the same guy who promised to build a Wall? Oopsie and wait, wait, MEXICO was supposed to pay for the wall, yeah! And Planned Parenthood. What happened? Oh, DOW? Down. Oil?
7819 2018-05-09 12:38:52 Exactly & if WM hadn't been stealing our oil since mid 70s we'd arguably the wealthiest one among these nations. If we were also Independent.

7822 2018-05-09 12:38:35 Bush family owns oil companies and part owner of an MLB team. Bush WAS paid! Yes, he’s a billionaire, all the more amazement for him working for free while being attacked/accused for anything he does 24/7!!
7823 2018-05-09 12:38:33 The deal itself wasn't a win.  Rather have them shorted on cash/trade bigly.  If you watch some without total hate Trump blindness on AM Maddow aka Morning Joe this am, many generally agree.  But for those on EU wanting the oil for their other partners.  Aka Britain and India.
7824 2018-05-09 12:38:30 You got that right. That is IF it ever disappears. At one point oil prices were lower than pre Katrina levels, and yet we we're still paying over $2.50 a gallon.
7825 2018-05-09 12:38:19 Apparently you slept through 2009 when global oil prices reached $160 a barrel.

7827 2018-05-09 12:38:13 Scotland's in the N. Sea. Not sure how much oil has been drilled since drilling began? Or what its to do with Norway having a filthy rich oil fund, and Scotland has sfa. Because it ballooned to a population of 65M. Doesn't add up, Scotland should still have 1/13 of Norway's. No?

7833 2018-05-09 12:37:29 Horse crap (as usual this is just another back end anti-Trump piece. Trump ends Iran deal so something has to be his fault....LOL)
We don't need Iran's oil & refining is the main reason gas prices do up & down as they do, plus we are now almost energy independent.
7834 2018-05-09 12:37:23 Shareholders at Putin Oil have to be happy about oil prices going up this summer.

And by "shareholders" I mean Putin.

7837 2018-05-09 12:36:29 Thanks for jacking gas prices back up to what they were before you took us out of the Iran deal. Now oil companies and refineries nationwide are going to get rich off the not so rich folks again.
7838 2018-05-09 12:36:28 Exactly. The Brits wanted to convert their navy from coal to oil.

7842 2018-05-09 12:36:21 We all know why Trump pulled out of the Iran deal. The rise in oil prices will generate trillions in rubles for Putin’s oil holdings.
7843 2018-05-09 12:36:20 lying in the sun covered in oil for hours on end yesterday seemed like the very best idea but today I honestly think I’ve got sun stroke gal’s not well

7880 2018-05-09 12:33:19 Rohani had ceded on several deal points, despite pressure of his hard wing. The arrival on market of iranian oil & gas risks changing geo-energy balances and thus weakening US regional allies at a time when Iran & Russia have just won war in Syria.

7930 2018-05-09 12:29:44 Are you suggest that EVERY barrel of oil produced in the United States is exported?  Every single barrel?
7931 2018-05-09 12:29:43 Oil price to go down. To finance its economy (and increased military), Iran will sell oil to China (which will be happy to buy at a 5% discount).
7932 2018-05-09 12:29:25 What price must oil hit to disrupt economies around the world?  Seems very 2007 ish to me.
7933 2018-05-09 12:29:24 I understand. You said "we can get our oil from elsewhere" you must have meant "you can get your oil from elsewhere". 

In terms of a military coup - that is not MY prediction, it is experts that have far far more experience and understanding than I do.

7944 2018-05-09 12:28:32 they don't like peppermint oil [neither do I]
7945 2018-05-09 12:28:18 "my oil gauge was reading 25% so i filled it with a jug of oil , now its smoking and leaking but its reading 100%? can you come look at it?"
7946 2018-05-09 12:28:11 But sanctions on Iranian oil will drive up oil prices, already happeing, for the benefit of oil moguls in Russia and US. The sanctions would result in a significant contraction in oil supply, as Iran is the world's 5th biggest supplier.
7947 2018-05-09 12:28:06 Fracking is usually natural gas, but that isn't the half of it. Either way when they frack, they fracture with high pressure by forcing a thick liquid filled with grit to release gas or oil. The liquid is pulled back out but it brings bad stuff with it & methane is released too.
7948 2018-05-09 12:28:05 Something happen in crude oil yesterday. Look at that volume in $USO... highest since July 2017.
7949 2018-05-09 12:27:58 A similar PP without a QB was strong the year before. PPs have high year-on-year variability. It's more likely to bounce back than 5v5 play. I think @Woodguy55 also pointed out they moved Drai off the bumper position & that structural change might've impacted.
7950 2018-05-09 12:27:58 @donlemon Putin and Donald Trump is working together to start a war using Israel so they can have an excuse to go in and steal oil this is all calculated Donald Trump pulling out of the deal they knew this was going to happen this was calculated from the start
7951 2018-05-09 12:27:57 Want me to make it look like an oil painting? Adds an artistic touch to it
7952 2018-05-09 12:27:55 I was shocked by how strident Trump’s speech was, threatening sanctions on sanctions violators even. NeoCon AF. Before us the ayatollahs rightly tremble. The regime can’t survive more sanctions, they will fall or reform. And oil is going to $100
7953 2018-05-09 12:27:49 As @cthagod says the craziest people come from the Bronx and all of Florida. Some dude broke in to a Burger King and DRANK 25 gallons of oil, he lives in Florida.

7957 2018-05-09 12:27:28 This summer, I have decided to trade in my coconut oil for sun block while I’m in the sun, swimming, whatever. I usually use coconut oil to tan but I’ve decided I refuse to have wrinkles from sun damage. But I look so much better tan  and I tan so well and so dark. Sad

7966 2018-05-09 12:26:50 No. It is 

1) Just do what Vlad says.

Putin wants:

*former allies fighting
*distrust of U.S. word
*possible war
*oil prices to skyrocket

All he has is oil & mobsters. War is when both make $$$
7967 2018-05-09 12:26:50 ららららー！　ららららー！
7968 2018-05-09 12:26:44 Dropping out of the bad deal doesn't impose new restrictions or limit oil supply to allies.
7969 2018-05-09 12:26:43 いいよぉー
7970 2018-05-09 12:26:42 That, and also because anything that drives up the cost of oil helps Russia’s economy. Also alienated us from allies, just like Putin wants.

7972 2018-05-09 12:26:40 Its actually due to supply and demand. A couple of the oil production refineries are not producing oil, thus leading to a small shortage than normal, which will drive oil prices up. Plus there is more demand now that the weather has changed.
7973 2018-05-09 12:26:37 You silly person. Oil has already shot up. You seem to not be paying attention to the markets or oil. Markets have gone flat and are trending down. Our laws state that we have to sanction any country that does business with Iran. You really should know what you are talking about.

High carb; how about this as an idea? Pasta with Sacla free from Basil Pesto sauce, soya mince and vegetable bolognese (use olive oil instead of butter), topped with VioLife Prosociano parmesan, and a side salad or antipasti. & red wine :)
7977 2018-05-09 12:26:05 Anyone seen Enos? I need him to get his truck out here with that order of fuel oil for our generators
7978 2018-05-09 12:26:01 @RepHuizenga doesn’t know anything about the Iran deal. He recklessly supports Trump which means there will be no deal. Oil prices will go up and centrifuges will start up again in Iran. We need to vote Huizenga out!

7984 2018-05-09 12:25:23 I recommend using sheet masks! I personally use 2 a week. Mediheal is also really good! And not just bc bts use it  And for moisturizer, there are some that help with oil control so they don't make your skin too oily but don't try it out either! Hope that helped 
7985 2018-05-09 12:25:05 The tearing up of the Iran deal is about one thing. Oil. Money.
7986 2018-05-09 12:25:03 Seriously Mr Trump you scured India China South Korea our economy depends on oil import you better reduce oil price by 2 to 3$ you are scruing your alley
7987 2018-05-09 12:25:01 Oil is above $70/barrel this morning, last we were at this level was Nov 2014- CDN$ was at 87 cents.. today we are at 77.5 cents on the CDN$. Thats 14% Exchange Rate Difference! Todays $13 beans would be $11.55/bu!
7988 2018-05-09 12:24:45 why do you think they have been shouting "death to america", is it just hatred, jealousy, oil envy, or is it something  the cia been up to in one of its clandestine operations that did not benefit the Iranians (in the 50's) where there is smoke there could be fire
7989 2018-05-09 12:24:33 Iranians are both (primarily) Persian as well as Shi'ite, whereas Saudis are primarily Sunni & Arab. They are tacitly involved in several proxy wars. We side with a brutal monarchy which still crucifies people, a corrupt regime, over a democratic one. Because of money. Oil.
7990 2018-05-09 12:24:27 So how much of that oil is drilled in Scotland and how much in the North Sea?

7992 2018-05-09 12:24:26 I understand, your a Snake Oil salesman.
You work hard (Relative to the straight up playboys you grew up with).
These ungrateful common people are Not Swallowing your BS.
34 percent of the Voters have, but that is not same meaning as 34 share on TV.
7993 2018-05-09 12:24:17 Was it in our national interest, for BIG OIL to drill, at the UNITED STATES NAVAL OIL RESERVE, at TEAPOT DOME??
7994 2018-05-09 12:24:13 Oil, oil, oil, the oil price has gone up, those USA oil companies will be rubbing their hands in glee
7995 2018-05-09 12:24:12 คิดถึง 
7996 2018-05-09 12:23:54 Venezuela ranks number 1 in oil reserves. 

Yet they are starving due to their socialism. 

BTW Exactly the government DEMS want for America
7997 2018-05-09 12:23:50 Okay then go commercial fishing/crabbing in Alaska, go logging, risk your life working in the oil fields in North Dakota Or Alaska. Become a bush pilot , Get drafted, or actually try living 100 years ago when oppression was very, very real.
7998 2018-05-09 12:23:49 Thats what Trump wants.  It makes more money for his oil business cronies.
7999 2018-05-09 12:23:38 Oil prices have gone up 80 pct in last year +. Trump giving Russia huge win!
8000 2018-05-09 12:23:35 Trump took care of 2 birds with one stone in ending the Iran deal. Obama, and his oil buddies.
8001 2018-05-09 12:23:33 Yeah, airbus, i think. Boeing also have orders they're no allowed to fill. But it's China eyeing the military mkt, some very competitive fighter bombers, and they want lots of oil
8002 2018-05-09 12:23:25 Treasury yields over 3% speaks of HIGH uncertainty in financial markets and the government having a hard time raising capital to buy debt, not a financially awesome combination. Oil prices are for screwing us petro consumers. Oil couldn’t stay low forever but this is BS
8003 2018-05-09 12:23:17 Yeah, what happened to the ND oil keeping prices down
8004 2018-05-09 12:23:16 めっちゃ強くなったよ
8005 2018-05-09 12:23:14 After we destabilized their democratic government to get cheaper oil and put in a dictator,  but hey whose counting? OH wait somehow we are....

8007 2018-05-09 12:23:02 Iran had previously threatened to stop flow of oil through the "Strait of Hormuz" which is the world's most important oil chokepoint due to its daily oil flow of about 17mln bpd, roughly 35% of all seaborne traded oil and almost 20% of oil traded worldwide #OOTT
8008 2018-05-09 12:22:59 @realDonaldTrump Saudis are at it again sir they’re manipulating oil prices higher. #OOTT

8015 2018-05-09 12:22:07 Not sure they are adding water. I think they are lighting matches and keeping the powder dry. We are back to the days of neo-cons and encouraging revolutions and high oil prices.

8022 2018-05-09 12:21:35 Crude oil price succeeded to achieve our first waited target at 71.00 and rallies upwards to move above this level now, which supports the continuation of our bullish overview efficiently in the upcoming period, paving the way to head towards our next target at 74.00.
8023 2018-05-09 12:21:31 Heads up to @HusqvarnaUSA for putting their oil in a plastic bag. The way this week has been, I would of snapped. Also very good push mower. 4WD is so helpful
8024 2018-05-09 12:21:24 So at the same time Saudi Arabia wants US to pressure sanctions on Iran and its oil exports, they also reduce their oil output driving up the gas cost to US consumers. Thanks?
8025 2018-05-09 12:21:22 #Oil prices are soaring & up $2 since the Iran announcement yesterday. Good for my business. I think that when industry does well it pours out into all other industries as well.

8030 2018-05-09 12:21:06 US stock futures are up 0.35% with both Asia and Europe mixed. Oil is up to $70.93 with gold at $1,312. The markets are still traveling without a clear destination.
8031 2018-05-09 12:21:02 Because it’s Obama’s deal & because Putin told him to.  Every action Trump takes in the Middle East is pushing those countries away from the US & toward Russia &/or China for support. Putin wants oil prices to increase & to control where the EU gets its oil from- good job, Trump!
8032 2018-05-09 12:21:00 @TheViewFromLL2  on the #45thPod you had compiled every time Trump mentioned taking Iran's oil.  Is that online somewhere? Seems applicable now...

Hormuz" #OOTT

8040 2018-05-09 12:20:36 1. Iran was poised to start nuke program back up in 7 yrs anyways and EU and IAEA is Still inspecting them for rest of agreement period. 2. American's will only benefit from Iran oil production and sales.

They are cheating athe deal by testing ballisic missles (that send nukes)
8041 2018-05-09 12:20:29 Girllllll u need Moroccan oil
8042 2018-05-09 12:20:28 Iran's oil is nationalized, that's the real reason the Republicans call them our enemy.
8043 2018-05-09 12:20:24 They have enough oil to make their own money. If they’re not smart enough to do so then let em burn.
8044 2018-05-09 12:20:22 Long live the oligarchs, which promoted Hitler's Party, long live the powers behind the banks, which supported Hitler even trough the war, long live the companies, which enabled the Nazis to produce synthetic oil. long live.. 

Ohh sorry, wrong thread :-)
8045 2018-05-09 12:20:17 @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr What is the game plan on our fuel costs at home?? I agree with pulling out of Iran deal but does not help oil prices.

8056 2018-05-09 12:19:52 Sanctions stopped Iran from selling their oil on the international market.  And how did Trump bully Iran or N. Korea.

8063 2018-05-09 12:19:16 Lol you serve Russia selflessly, you stupid traitorous pawn. You gave Russia and Putin a gift wrapped early Christmas yesterday pulling out of Iran deal.

8084 2018-05-09 12:17:37 Driving up oil prices which strongly benefits Putin and hurts poor people. Double win.
8085 2018-05-09 12:17:32 So strong you say? Oil is up, interest rates creeping, housing & auto declining, US rail loads lower, businesses still closing, big $ going to shareholders not re-investing... looks like the the start of the little bush economic collapse to me, but as long as the rich win..

8088 2018-05-09 12:17:24 @WhiteHouse @PressSec 1) US wants practical solutions :Avoid #OPEC S.Arabia/Gulf & Oil Hedge Funds & speculators from cutting supplies to push Oil barrel to $90-100 as they decided last week. US should never be the Oil Lobby free profit & entertainment, can Congress stop that ?
8089 2018-05-09 12:17:15 We lose any leverage we had over Iran AND we lose any good faith going into any other deal, like NK. 

You are afraid of Iran, which is why you want to give them the power to build a nuke. Good job sparky. 

Meanwhile, oil prices skyrocket, impirts/exports fo down and GDP falls.

8183 2018-05-09 12:10:05 Iran has the 4th largest oil reserves in the world. Over the past 100 years, Iran has had a complicated history with the West. Their main oil company, Anglo-Iranian was nationalized by Mossadegh in the 50s.

8198 2018-05-09 12:08:42 , But hey, I hear Putin will be happy.  He owns oil and really, that's the only thing "Little Dick Donny" cares about.
8199 2018-05-09 12:08:29 Cool story. The United States may not but Iranian oil but it still buys a ton of oil. Global demand is a factor in oil prices. If the US put sanctions on Iranian oil making it unavailable to the global market the global supply shrinks. Therefore the price goes up.

8201 2018-05-09 12:08:21 That’s wrong Bill. The collapse of the Libyan regime and chaos in Iraq strengthened  the Iranians as an oil and natural gas exporter to meet demand in China, Japan and Germany. Those nations were going to negotiate deals with Iran with or without the US

8204 2018-05-09 12:08:03 #BikeToSchoolDay really isn't in the spirit of America's wasting of fossil fuels that pollute the environment, but I suppose it's a good precursor to a world where oil is too expensive as a result of our imminent conflict with #Iran as a result of the #IranDealWithdrawl.
8205 2018-05-09 12:07:58 Or oil at $55
8206 2018-05-09 12:07:57 Oh I’m playing like I’m not trying to get this oil changed today.
8207 2018-05-09 12:07:45 Could the Trump admin’s “strategy” be this?
“Let Middle East countries fight each other while we profit from arms sales and the rise in the price of oil”
8208 2018-05-09 12:07:44 Okay, the Saudis have got their oil price rise, can we stop this now?

8212 2018-05-09 12:07:11 Actually, this may end up doing nothing except increase oil prices. We do not trade with Iran, so we can not sanction them. If the #shitholePresident has a moment of clarity and does not put sanctions on European countries dealing with Iran, nothing changes. #TakeBackOurCountry

8224 2018-05-09 12:06:05 What’s is a sham is you pulling out of Iran deal to only have your Saudi friends come to the rescue on oil. One can only guess what’s in it for you and your pals. This is about $ for you and yours and undoing all President Obama did. Pathetic
8225 2018-05-09 12:06:04 After the whole Iran, Syria, Saudi Arabia and Persian Gulf region is destabilized, Russia will get more money for its oil and gas export - more political extortion leverage. MAGA people too will pay more for gasoline.
Kremlin will laugh and laugh and then ruin something more.
8226 2018-05-09 12:06:01 I’m curious about domino impact of US’s Iran sanctions on LNG supply contracts & infrastructure project finance (because of linkage to oil price)— as well as how it may strengthen use of the new PetroYuan & Yamal $$? Who covers this type of analysis? What are your thoughts?

8231 2018-05-09 12:05:33 sorry exporter now. Remember I said last year U.S is going to be opening up its oil taps. HMMMM close the strait of Hormuz and everybody come buy U.S oil. First jack the price up...

8235 2018-05-09 12:05:08 #CroozefmNews Oil prices surged nearly three percent on Wednesday, reaching fresh 3.5-year highs after President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal, resulting in sanctions on the Islamic Republic's crude exports.
8236 2018-05-09 12:05:06 Yes, but this downward revision is happening at the time when the oil price is growing again, comfortably staying above $70 per barrel. Which just tells you about the state of the Russian economy.
8237 2018-05-09 12:05:05 I wonder how many Trump family members & associates own oil shares? #wato #bbcwato

8258 2018-05-09 12:03:21 The proposed exploratory oil well by Kanter in Broward is on appeal of the state's denial, but thumper truck exploration like Burnett's is an earlier stage of data gathering and easier to get permitted.
8259 2018-05-09 12:03:20 There are quite a few throughout the hills around Alma, left from the oil boom days of 1880s to maybe the mid-1930s. Some are plugged up top, others are open. Some are plugged far below. You can definitely hear a metallic reverb when rocks hit the bottom.
8260 2018-05-09 12:03:15 There appears to be several stories out there regarding where this money came from. I also saw one regarding payment due to sales to Shell Oil purchases.

8312 2018-05-09 11:59:15 win-win for Russia. 
 They will get a huge monetary return on their investment. Russian tv knows that the raising of oil prices benefits them.   The secondary gain is  Russia destroys US credibility on the world stage. No longer the leader in global influence.
8313 2018-05-09 11:59:14 We (the US) toppled their democratically elected leader in 1953 and installed a fascist regime just to get cheaper oil. After they overthrew it, we gave Saddam Hussein chemical weapons, pointed him at Iran, and said "go get 'em". Who is acting like an enemy at every opportunity?

8338 2018-05-09 11:56:43 Yup and every time shit hits the fan in the Middle East the ones truly responsible are ALWAYS the oiligarchs (Anyone with ties to big oil).
8339 2018-05-09 11:56:43 win-win for Russia. 
 They will get a huge monetary return on their investment. Russian tv knows that the raising of oil prices benefits them.   The secondary gain is  Russia further separates the United States from world  leadership position.
8340 2018-05-09 11:56:38 #Russia state TV is having a panel discussion as to where to find 8 trillion rubles needed to implement Putin’s domestic policy goals. Female host says: "Looks like we found it. Trump is withdrawing US from the #Iran nuclear deal. Oil prices should go up, which is good for us."

EIA predictions from API Inventories

Crude: -5.3mb
Cushing: +1.1mb
Distillates: -4.0mb
Gasoline Stocks: -1.0mb

Look a very bullish set of numbers if API Inventories are correct.

8347 2018-05-09 11:56:05 The huge range down failure in #oil yesterday has been tossed aside and the bulls are back. In fact, despite a lack of international consensus on the US nuclear deal withdrawal, the energy complex has charged higher in a fashion that speaks of ongoing bullish momentum.
8348 2018-05-09 11:56:04 Good news for oil produces outside of the region and good news for arms suppliers  :-(
8349 2018-05-09 11:55:55 Remember when you said going for chrome was a waste of time and is nothing but an “oil spill” on your gun?? What happened?!?!??
8350 2018-05-09 11:55:51 Weird that our "allies" would be upset at America pulling out of the Iran deal, eh?  It's almost like they want us to keep paying for their cheap oil from Iran...   "with friends like these"
8351 2018-05-09 11:55:47 An old windbag likes that needs all the publicity she can get.

8353 2018-05-09 11:55:35 2/2 In fact, considering that people are calling data the new oil, a metaphor that can be generalized to knowledge as such, we might want to ask if universities are a site for extraction just like oil fields and the attendant violence that extraction brings wherever it happens
8354 2018-05-09 11:55:32 Oil and gas going up - good for Russia. My words after Trumps announcement
8355 2018-05-09 11:55:27 One Iran has been terrorizing people for centuries , the coup was cause they stole UK oil and then price gouged , Iraq was a result of threatening neighbors and harboring terrorist ,the ring Leader of 9/11 was Iran ,bush the second was an idiot .

Who doesn't?: rest of the world.
8362 2018-05-09 11:54:50 Why spend more $ on power we don’t need? We need revenue esp for the next 60 yrs while we pay off LEGACY from oil, as much of it as we can get to market is the reality.
8363 2018-05-09 11:54:49 Window strikes on homes & businesses and predation by house cats kills literally billions of birds. 

I find your concern for birds re wind turbines... situational. 

Seems you’re not pro-birds, you’re anti-wind.  Big Oil sending u a check?
8364 2018-05-09 11:54:48 Is it really to make the world safer or diminishing the oil offer and increasing  the price per barrel
8365 2018-05-09 11:54:41 >Trump's move doesn't make sense ecconomically!!!!!
It does he's makeing profit in self interest. By pulling out it will reduce the amount of oil in the market raising prices while shorting the Dollar
8366 2018-05-09 11:54:40 Plant-based, fruit, vegetables, herbs, legumes, olive oil, grains. Built from basic ingredients. Nothing processed.
8367 2018-05-09 11:54:29 Stop showing these outdated oil products
8368 2018-05-09 11:54:27 The Earth has been both hooter and cooler than present that is make much ppl don't believe to #GlobalWarming . Nature activity (volcanism,.)
Produce 0,3-0,6 bil tonnes per year and human activity produce 35-40 bil tonnes per year. In Fact We can't run frm fossil oil immediately.
8369 2018-05-09 11:54:26 @cspanwj Trump... price of oil due to reneging on JCPOA?
8370 2018-05-09 11:54:21 They don't want respect they want cheap oil
8371 2018-05-09 11:54:21 I’m hearing the front-month CNY oil contract traded big volume today (>2x prior highest day) in the immediate aftermath of the US pulling out of Iran deal...interesting to keep an eye on.
8372 2018-05-09 11:54:16 #Oil jumps as #Trump tells buyers to cut back on #IranianCrude
8373 2018-05-09 11:54:03 Look for increased trade between Iran and those other parties to the deal. Oil in those countries will get cheaper, and the US sanctions will be ineffective. Everyone wins...but US.
8374 2018-05-09 11:54:00 Good point in BC $1.70 litre what is it when oil hits $100 a barrel $3.50 a litre. You retards keep electing irresponsible ndp and liberals with their constant tax on tax on tax models to compensate for their irresponsible reckless spending of our money.
8375 2018-05-09 11:53:59 Spent around four exhausting hours (yes I know that’s a shocking amount of time) getting rid of the last few tangles and knots caused by coconut oil a few weeks ago. They’ve been hiding in my hair for weeks but I hadn’t noticed them until recently
8376 2018-05-09 11:53:44 If the oil companies and OPEC can test 60&+ oil prices fixing the market why can't Americans demand more money per hour for pay? They fix prices raising them for no reason no charges of price gauging why.but yet Americans demanding to be paid better is wrong,why?
8377 2018-05-09 11:53:42 i told @SophiaFlick i can’t drive my car bc of an oil leak and here is (i quote) exactly what she replied: “Lmao start the mower”.  someone come get ur girl bc im done
8378 2018-05-09 11:53:34 I have no idea why anyone feels that oil has to go down?!?! It's in a very bullish Trend and that will continue until it's broken $uso way too many retail Traders are bears and oil until they change it will keep going up
8379 2018-05-09 11:53:29 That 41yrs before oil gets exhausted is too far.

With Africa's growing population and middle class alone, the oil consumption will spike.

I say 28-33yrs before exhaustion.

8383 2018-05-09 11:53:20 Moscow has recently begun discussions with Iran and Turkey to encourage more trade using local currencies rather than US dollars – to date the talks have focused on oil sales, but it is possible it could be extended into other areas.

8387 2018-05-09 11:52:52 It’s not because of Obama. It’s because Putin told him to. Oil already is going up as a result which helps Putin. The Anti Obama narrative is a distraction. Obama’s policies helped America. Put in is forcing Trump to dismantle anything that helps America.

8391 2018-05-09 11:52:23 Hemp is a powerful competitor to crude oil in many ways. Banning hemp was an attempt to destroy competition to oil-based products.

8393 2018-05-09 11:52:12 There's plenty of oil in North America. Why import it when we've got lots of our own?
8394 2018-05-09 11:52:02 As long as Europe is into this deal
Euro will take care of Oil import thing

Major issue is strategic project like Chabahar port

8397 2018-05-09 11:51:39 How is nuclear energy a necessity for a major oil producer? If you are not self-sufficient in energy- without nuclear power- then your regime is incompetent.

8401 2018-05-09 11:51:21 ah but China and Russia will -- and maybe Turkey -- and Iran will still be able to sell oil

8406 2018-05-09 11:50:32 Technologies like batteries will play a large role in replacing fossil fuels with renewables even in the region where oil and gas are very cheap, says Andrea Lovato, VP at AQWA Power, at @EBRD #EBRDam in #Jordan #EBRDgreen

8417 2018-05-09 11:49:10 Gonna be a bug headache for India, as oil's already at $80, soon this year it'll be $100 & in 2019 it'll stabilise @ $120!
8418 2018-05-09 11:49:06 Energy industry insiders say Trump's tough stance on Iran will probably keep oil and gasoline prices higher than they would otherwise be.  But at least your ego is intact, right Trump?  #IdiotInChief #AmericaAtRisk #gasprices #ImpeachTrump #Bernie2020
8419 2018-05-09 11:48:57 @Gavekal on #IranDealWithdrawal : “...time honored principle of ‘buy the rumor and sell the news’. Near-record speculative positions suggest that today’s US$75 a barrel oil price may already discount the sanctions against Iran.”
8420 2018-05-09 11:48:39 Hemp is a powerful competitor to crude oil in many ways. Banning hemp was an attempt to destroy competition to oil-based products.
8421 2018-05-09 11:48:33 You dont get oil from us, its the other way around. If Rouhani fails, it is predicted that the military will topple the regime. Do you think that will be better for the people, or worse? When has a military regime EVER benefited the people?
8422 2018-05-09 11:48:31 It’s time to short oil and gold as well
8423 2018-05-09 11:48:03 You mean Republicans didn’t support it, the same ones who lied our way into an unnecessary war for oil, who also reflexively opposed everything Obama did, even more nutritious school lunches, or an attempt to keep us all from going broke from healthcare.
8424 2018-05-09 11:47:54 Na the perfume oil be this or Whutt?
8425 2018-05-09 11:47:24 There are dozens of tankers every day going from Alaska to Washington State, some of us are just smart enough to know that this is a US effort to maintain the large discount the US receives on Canadian oil. What will you do once all the lost oil revenue forces you to get a job!
8426 2018-05-09 11:47:19 Yesterday, Sarah Palin was watching the celebration in Russia from her porch. @realDonaldTrump just gave Putin, Iran and higher oil prices. Is the repayment done yet?

8427 2018-05-09 11:47:16 Watch the PRICE of OIL and GAS - EXPECT to PAY MORE !
8428 2018-05-09 11:47:16 We all know UN is a muslim governed organization because of oil prices, so whatever the UN said is a big lie since I never heard a muslim tell something that’s true.
Remember SA being head of the Human Rights commission.
Biggest joke of the century.
8429 2018-05-09 11:47:13 And now Trump is telling nations around the world to not buy Iran oil or face penalties. Don't think that's gonna fly with the UN SC resolution still in force.

Your doing a great job.
8433 2018-05-09 11:46:46 Can I suggest him that, if he somehow using his international clout manages to get us oil on discounted rates than I'm sure the government be willing to pass the relief to the public?
8434 2018-05-09 11:46:28 With this wonderful president of ours having withdrawn from the Iran deal, oil prices will rise sharply, costing us more at the pump ($3.00 a gal.) wiping out any tax saving? WTF?
8435 2018-05-09 11:46:19 Relying solely crude oil as a source of income and importing every other finished good is a recipe for disaster
8436 2018-05-09 11:46:14 I still remember being taught in grade school that by the early 2000's we were going to run out of oil.

8439 2018-05-09 11:46:05 More the price of crude oil more the government revenues.
8440 2018-05-09 11:45:58 think they need weigh the cons and pros of trumps decision. If he targets their oil how will the world cope.
8441 2018-05-09 11:45:53 Twitter America, has anyone notice that gasoline has skyrocketed up and over $3 a gallon and rising. A deal was made a few months ago to raise a barrel if oil to over $100 a barrel. Basically, buy our military weapons, you can raise the price of a barrel of oil $100 per
8442 2018-05-09 11:45:31 下水流よく追いついた
8443 2018-05-09 11:45:20 Or somehow giving cheaper oil to China (from Iran) while price on global markets rise (good for Saudis)
8444 2018-05-09 11:45:14 Plenty of oil on these pies. Sorry 
8445 2018-05-09 11:45:10 I don’t think oil can keep going up. Demand has got to start dropping at these prices.
8446 2018-05-09 11:45:06 ...and the price of oil is on the rise. Look out!
8447 2018-05-09 11:45:00 With Bibi in the mix and pulling the strings of Trump this most definitely won't end well. Land grabs, Oil, Gas and Minerals, drives these lunatics to start wars. GREED
8448 2018-05-09 11:44:57 We Indians paid a heavy price aftermath of Iraq war. Oil price rocketed and Indians were the receiving end. Withdrawal of Iran deal is just an excuse to attack Iran. Israel may benefit from the turmoil, but we Indians are going to suffer. Be right wing, but think for the country
8449 2018-05-09 11:44:55 It should but it won’t! The world is addicted to oil 
8450 2018-05-09 11:44:55 Save your tax refund for when the oil prices go up to 5 dollars or more a gallon. Forget your road trips.... But don't worry Trumpsters your McDonald burgers will go up in price but you will still be able to afford a romantic evening out.
8451 2018-05-09 11:44:54 Oil has touched 77$ it will break 90$ by aug.  and 100$ as the winter sets. At 80$ US shale becomes viable.  No surprise why Iranian oil needs to be off the market.
8452 2018-05-09 11:44:35 Iran isn’t a top 10 exporter of oil. This isn’t the 1970s. We’ve also had sanctions on them for the better part of 30 years. Are you a supporter of an arrangement where Iran does not fulfill their obligations, yet get the benefits?
8453 2018-05-09 11:44:32 I’ve just read that Digestive biscuits contain palm oil. Therefore have now finished my last pack. It is a sad day. And I feel sick after all those biscuits.

8466 2018-05-09 11:43:24 #IranDealWithdrawal Would boost crude oil output in US. Deal was meant to discourage Iran from enriching uranium for N-power (and possible dual use). Indian pressurized heavy water reactors use natural uranium as fuel. Surely, way ahead is PHWRs for Iran. India is yet not in NSG.

8497 2018-05-09 11:40:16 You're correct about their exports. However it wouldn't be so easy for them to export their own oil without importing our oil at a discount. They're making money on both ends and gas is almost half the price in US as it is in CAN. Not to mention reduced cost to do business etc.
8498 2018-05-09 11:40:14 People should be more concerned about what is about to happen with gas and oil prices....your "tax cut" is all a scheme to rob more of the poor to feed the rich. Your supporters are just too simple to realize it.
8499 2018-05-09 11:40:10 @realDonaldTrump if we have all kinds of oil then why are we stiil at the mercy of OPEC high gas prices will affect economy transportation cost go up consumer goods will be hard to get cause we need gas for cars to get to work this hurt middle america tnx for nothing

**Asian Stocks trade lower overnight while European markets higher. Burberry down by 6%

**Bitcoin unchanged trading still at $9200
8514 2018-05-09 11:38:20 It is also worth noting that I’d fully expect the next move to be to reinstate sanctions on Iranian oil experts which could mean gas prices for us taxpayers going up but that gets very complicated and I’m no economist. It’s a show and it’s politics but it’s good for nobody.

8519 2018-05-09 11:37:55 First, gas prices ALWAYS rise before the summer travel season. Happens every year. But, full oil ships parked all over the globe will eventually force reduction in these artificially high prices. If OPEC won't play nice, US can easily step up production & price will drop.

8521 2018-05-09 11:37:46 I think it is a good time to charge the U.S. world prices for our oil instead of the huge discounts they now receive, since Canada supplies the U.S. with over 40% of their oil used. Time to for Canada to renegotiate the "worst deal ever" as Trump would say.

8524 2018-05-09 11:37:24 Is the Iran nuclear programme about creating a weapon or is it about nuclear energy? Their economy is very dependent on oil which will eventually run out. Why shouldn't they look for alternative sources of energy, although #Solar would be a safer prospect now in both senses
8525 2018-05-09 11:37:14 Me too - went for a trekking holiday last year and it was just horrific. The local population, even ones working in the wildlife reserves, are told to tell the tourists that the palm oil plantations are a good thing. It was awful to see.
8526 2018-05-09 11:37:08 Please, note everyone saying higher inflation & higher oil prices. Opposite will happen!!
8527 2018-05-09 11:36:54 Power use by oil refinery is a red herring. EV would use 25% of UK electricity annually, that is an enormous number and requires significant increase in power stations.

8547 2018-05-09 11:35:03 My question was meant as sarcasm. If crude prices go and stay up, total employment/income in AB goes up, but not necessarily wage rates. And there's a very long lag. The lion's share of people who lost jobs in AB when the oil price crashed left the province. So they converted ..2

8571 2018-05-09 11:32:17 Yep gas will go up. You are right. But with all our deals we buy a lot of crud oil instead of getting it from Louisiana and Texas. But trust the president he will fix that too. My god our country was going down the tubes for the last eight years.

8573 2018-05-09 11:32:04 The animosity started when the U.S. covertly overthrew the democratically elected govt. of Iran and installed a puppet "Shah," who wouldn't stop the oil sales. The Iranians have been the victims of U.S. corporate policy for over 70 years. Can't really blame them for being bitter.
8574 2018-05-09 11:32:01 Another tsunami is on the cards. Trump’s pull out from Iran nuclear deal, an excuse to attack Iran. Israel may earn so much from it. But a country like India would be the sufferer. Iraq war sky rocketed oil price in India, Iran war will ruin our economy. Wait and watch

8576 2018-05-09 11:31:53 "Treasury Secretary Mnuchin"firms can seek waivers or special licenses to operate in Iran, sending conflicting messages." “to a certain extent, some of this (price)was already in the market on oil prices”."both China and India have said they will continue importing Iranian oil."
8577 2018-05-09 11:31:45 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President...Tell Saudi Arabia to stop limiting oil production.  Americas are getting ticked off every time we go by the gas pump, and see our hard earned money go to artificially created prices.  I thought " drill baby , drill " was to keep gas low.
8578 2018-05-09 11:31:44 If you are concerned about eating non-halal animal meats, I would recommend getting the Filet O Fish, as McD never uses the same oil n fryer for cooking fish and their other animal meats. I was told that even their deepfryer has designations for potatoes, fish and other frieds.
8579 2018-05-09 11:31:39 The Iranians just want handouts...money, medical supplies, etc. It is an oil-rich country that seems to have no money to take care of its people.  Where's the money going?  Thanks to Trump, the US is no longer dependent of foreign oil.

If oil prices go up blame the media. The media is building this speculation...as speculation goes up oil prices on futures market will go up. We do not get oil from Iran. Probably N korea, china, Russia get oil from iran. America sells oil internationally now.
8594 2018-05-09 11:30:40 Sad to see European leaders ready to compromise with their security and values for barrels of oil. To be free is being able to stop a dangerous terrorist country who call to destruct you and never compromising because of financial pressure. #IranDeal

Trump maybe the most transactional POTUS in our nation's history.

In regards his Iran decision, ask who benefits?

Big Oil, OPEC, our so-called Saudi -Terrorist- Ally, & the Defense Industry (although Boeing is not happy right now).  Israel too, loves...

8599 2018-05-09 11:30:14 I’ll keep monitoring, but equities don’t seem to be falling with rising oil and a 3% 10-yr.
8600 2018-05-09 11:30:12 Shhh. Don’t tell @SecretaryZinke - next thing you know, his good friends in oil and NG will be drilling them.
8601 2018-05-09 11:30:11 Use any hair oil like olive oil or coconut oil on damp hair. Applying oil or product on damp hair absorbs better.
8602 2018-05-09 11:30:06 The plan is to “attack Iran and take the oil.” THAT’S what Trump is getting at. You know. Because, corruption.

8619 2018-05-09 11:28:01 How much oil do we get from Iran?
8620 2018-05-09 11:27:46 The money belonged to Iran in the first place and was stolen by the US in 1979. The US helped to impose the Rothschild puppet Shah on Iran in 1953 overthrowing the popularly elected President there because he nationalized the oil fields. Facts matter!
8621 2018-05-09 11:27:38 Good! Do God’s work— continue preaching & stay out of politics! Religion does NOT belong in politics & politics does BOT belong in religion! Oil & water doesn’t mix! Religion & politics ARE oil & water! They should remain separate!
8622 2018-05-09 11:27:27 Ways Putin wins on Trump Iran fiasco: more influence w Iran, weaker Atlantic alliance, higher oil prices, diminished US standing. 4-for-1.
8623 2018-05-09 11:27:27 @MorningExp 
Come on Jen tell the truth. We are oil independent and price of oil is based on oil futures not supply and demand. We do not get oil from iran. American oil execs love media for hamping up all this speculation which will influence futures on stock market.
8624 2018-05-09 11:27:14 It’s all about money. Oil prices skyrocketing justifies drilling for oil up and down America’s coastlines. Oil companies and Trump make boatloads of cash, leaving reg Americans poor. Sounds a lot like Russia. Hmmmmm.

8627 2018-05-09 11:26:44 Here go the oil prices.
8628 2018-05-09 11:26:39 But the price of oil is going up. Putin’s puppet is playing his role well.
8629 2018-05-09 11:26:28 Oil companies have rigged gas prices for decades . When oil hit 40-50$ a barrel we were still paying way more per gallon than when oil 1st hit that years ago the process hasn’t changed delivery is easier prices should be going down not up. We’re being screwed massively
8630 2018-05-09 11:26:16 Quietly mulls how relieved the Russians are gonna be with $100-dollar a barrel oil
8631 2018-05-09 11:26:10 So @T8_97_car is having a party for her bosses birthday. Except she forgot to invite him. Or tell him. I suspect an excuse to drink oil on a weeknight…. 
8632 2018-05-09 11:26:09 But global oil prices will almost certainly rise as a result of sanctions. Guess which country (and its leader) is heavily into oil and, therefore, benefits from that?
8633 2018-05-09 11:26:04 Stepdad is currently recommending "krill oil" to other hospital patients.
8634 2018-05-09 11:25:55 Hey Skippy the price of oil was the same price in July 2014, for same reasons, refinery maintenance and price of oil.
8635 2018-05-09 11:25:55 I get bad dry scalp&dandruff when Hawai’i has weather changes. coconut oil massages into my scalp and hair feels so fkn amazing left over night! #fixesproblem
8636 2018-05-09 11:25:26 Hope u did more research about it , cuz now we’re building the biggest Oil Refinery in the Middle East , jazan  city. Pretty sure that means there’s some oil . So I seriously advise u not to worry about it cuz if there is no more oil . We still have money 
8637 2018-05-09 11:25:17 You should've tuned up the car based on the mechanic's diagnostics during your last oil change.
8638 2018-05-09 11:25:06 1) Israel is much more hawkish on Iran than SA, but that doesnt matter bc our leaders make their own stupid decisions themselves
2) we produce more oil and gas than SA. US is highest producing nation in the world, no, we dont need anyone’s help regarding the “PeTrOdOlLaR”

8639 2018-05-09 11:25:01 What's the deal do republicans let oil companies exploit their consumers or what.  Don't get it wrong I'm a Republican but every time their in office gas prices go up.

8644 2018-05-09 11:24:49 Well, the Russian backed mob boss may just have given his mob boss a huge erection via a rise in oil prices. Vlad and his oligarchs are probably popping champagne corks as we speak.

8648 2018-05-09 11:24:26 Hey...
Does anybody else notice that #Iran, with its Arabian Sea Ports, is only separated from Russia by two small ex patriotic countries?

8650 2018-05-09 11:24:20 @JoeNBC @morningmika
Trump ends Iran deal. Oil prices surge well above $70 a barrel, and will probably continue higher. Russia oil is 70% of it's exports, 52% of it's budget.
Coincidence?

8669 2018-05-09 11:22:10 Southern Europe has good renewable energy sources. One way to lift the South of Europe out of its malaise. The transition has to include switch from imported gas and oil to maximise returns to the economies.

8671 2018-05-09 11:21:48 Come on man, The EU already announced they were sticking with the Iran Deal. So Iran still makes money selling oil, meanwhile gas prices here will skyrocket for a while. Then Trump will write a new Iran Deal which will essentially be the old deal just with Trump’s name on it.
8672 2018-05-09 11:21:38 Just what Putin wants.... higher oil prices.
8673 2018-05-09 11:21:38 got argan oil of morocco!
8674 2018-05-09 11:21:36 Yep and this could cause a war which = more looting of oil by the US. If Russia ends up supporting this, it'll be because they'll see something to get out of it too.

8680 2018-05-09 11:20:45 Get ready to spend those few extra bucks in your wallet from the tax cut, Trumpsters. Trump’s pullout from the Iran treatywill definitely affect gas prices. Mnu hin is lying by saying other producers will step up to produce more oil; they’re cutting to raise prices.

8684 2018-05-09 11:20:09 Once again under Republican leadership we are about to see oil and gas prices skyrocket. We are at an all time low in consumption so it's not a issue of supply/demand. Most fuel efficient vehicles in history are on the road. They create problems to hurt consumers.
8685 2018-05-09 11:20:02 I'm sure the average US citizen will be happy to pay high gas prices, as long as oil companies make lots of money. Well maybe not :)

8695 2018-05-09 11:19:30 This is a FAKE assessment: Just take the note of Oil Prices which will go up to 100 USD/barrel in near future and that has approx. 0.8 GDP point weightage. So in real term, India is going to have a bad days after Trump decision for Iran.
8696 2018-05-09 11:19:26 I pity the fool. Get ready for higher gas and oil

Do you think those beggars will waste money on testing it??
8728 2018-05-09 11:16:09 And oil prices are hitting high ... so high !
8729 2018-05-09 11:16:01 It sounds like millennial Patchouli oil.
8730 2018-05-09 11:15:51 Shannon Rivkin, investment director of Australia’s Rivkin Securities, said that oil prices had been driven up due to “growing concerns over the economic collapse of Venezuela and its oil industry, plus possible new sanctions against Iran from the Trump administration.”

8734 2018-05-09 11:14:14 With oil prices on the rise, markets expect future inflation increases and see further support for future US #Fed hikes.  #Irandeal
8735 2018-05-09 11:14:11 @realDonaldTrump (Bolton & Bebe) always wanted this, an excuse to invade Iran & take the oil (always about power & oil). He doesn't care if he pisses off China/Russia. NK means nothing any more, no resources to offer (steal), war with them is a waste/diversion, peace make sense.

8739 2018-05-09 11:13:46 Same thing happened after the Dick Cheney energy summit. Oil prices skyrocketed. America is in the repeat phase of: Lie, swindle and repeat political cycle.
8740 2018-05-09 11:13:46 Meanwhile - @BarclaysIB - the reduction of Iranian production in 2019 is expected to go from 3,910,000 barrels per day to 3,740,000 barrels per day. 
Sanctions should have little effect on #Iran's crude #oil production in 2018.
8741 2018-05-09 11:13:44 Uncertainty of global oil supplies grows as countries who continue business with Iran may be penalized and feel the burn.  #irandeal
8742 2018-05-09 11:13:42 #Trump cancel of #Irandeal destroys #US credibility, undermines pro-western #Iranian opinion, empowers hardliners, triggers an oil price crisis, increases the risk of conflict centered on #Syria & #Israel, & damages the western alliance to the advantage of others.
8743 2018-05-09 11:13:42 @GOP @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan The swamp gets bigger and bigger oil prices surging, interest rates climbing, no wage increases, and now we are funnelling money from Russians and major American companies to Trumps lawyer. What are you doing about this????

8752 2018-05-09 11:12:58 Wednesday, trying to ease Crude Oil  market concerns, Saudi Arabia said that it would work with other producers to diminish the impact of any shortage in Crude Oil supplies resulting from the renewed sanctions on Iran. $OIL
8753 2018-05-09 11:12:57 So is Russia. They will get a huge monetary return on their investment. Russian tv knows that the raising of oil prices benefits them.  Russia further separates the United States from leadership position is a secondary gain.

8755 2018-05-09 11:12:52 Let’s take a look at the Facts on Iran .. UK, Germany, and France still support and will continue with the plan. Israel, Saudi Arabia, and The United Emirates approve and are very pleased with USA withdrawal ! And Russia and Saudi Arabia watch what happens to oil prices !!!
8756 2018-05-09 11:12:36 President Trump does not do any thing for purely altruistic reasons.He could not give a damn about Iran’s Nuclear blah blah blah.He just wants to line the pockets of his Richie rich oil companies that donate heaps of rich stuff to his next election.

8765 2018-05-09 11:11:49 Net Neutrality - gives big tech free reign to monopolize. No investment in "green energy" which allows oil shortages, thus seriously increasing cost of gas & home heating oil. Pulling out of Iran deal. Again, serious increase in our expenses. There's more but I don't care to educ
8766 2018-05-09 11:11:40 Oil producers are making huge profits out of this political conflicts ! Consumers around the world are paying the price ... we should go towards alternative energies NOW

8770 2018-05-09 11:11:28 Tell me if you disagree that one or both is taking place; 45 announced pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal because 1) he needs another reason to go to war if North Korea works out and/or 2) he’s short on oil
8771 2018-05-09 11:11:23 Boeing will be worried - a $17bn deal to provide one company with planes and another contract with second company in pipeline.  General Electric and Oil companies etc will also be unhappy. I just hope the EU ignores Trump and continues with agreement. We can get round banking etc
8772 2018-05-09 11:11:21 YOU are defective at your core, @realDonaldTrump. The ONLY reason you are pulling out of this deal is to stick it to Obama (a better @POTUS and smarter human than you will ever be) AND so that oil money will flow directly into all of your cronies' pockets. You made us less safe.

8777 2018-05-09 11:10:53 China imports 600,000 barrels of Iranian oil daily. Don't think Trump can derail that. Realpolitik will give Trump a lesson he badly needs to learn. @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats
8778 2018-05-09 11:10:52 Trump just destroyed our credibility as dealmakers, ruined any chance of peace talks with NK involving the US, and allowed Iran to pursue nuclear weapons again. OH and he just gave Putin and Saudi a massive chunk of money via skyrocketing oil prices.

8783 2018-05-09 11:10:30 How does it lower our reliance on foreign lands? We still get our oil from the Saudis.  Plus gas prices have gone way up with all of the exports. Increased production helps oil companies and politicians, not the rest of America. However, gas prices are lower in China now.

8809 2018-05-09 11:08:07 Even when our oil price exceeds 100$ , we will still face that problem of #عمانيون_بلا_وظايف30  because it's not a problem of economic recession! believe me
8810 2018-05-09 11:08:07 I dont think he is that shallow.  He also wanted to damage US relations with our allies, get into war with Iran, and help Russian oil prices rise.  See how much better that spunds?
8811 2018-05-09 11:07:59 @realDonaldTrump on April the 20th you said high oil prices would not be accepted. Yet, you have done nothing!

Trump maybe the most transactional POTUS in our nation's history.

In regards his Iran decision, ask who benefits?

Big Oil, OPEC, our so-called Saudi -Terrorist- Ally, and the Defense Industry (although Boeing is not happy right now)... Israel too, loves...
8831 2018-05-09 11:06:29 $4 per gallon gas isn’t the important thing. Need to pay attention to oil prices. I suspect they want to make US fracking viable again. When oil is above $100/barrel this can roll on for them.

Fact is, I'm way deep in the hole with the price of gas. Whoops, there goes another extra $25 in the gas tank.  Thanks, Mr. President.
8977 2018-05-09 10:49:02 So the equation comparing US policy impact on the global (and eventual US) economy is:

#TaxCuts ≠ #TradeWar+#sanctions+#Iran 

The right-hand-side wins easily via direct and indirect impact on global trade volumes, oil prices, EM hard and local ccy debt, market confidence, etc
8978 2018-05-09 10:48:53 Media like #MorningJoe are DESPERATE to overcomplicate Trump's pulling out of the Iran deal, exploring geopolitical nuances to justify their salaries.  Pulling out causes Oil prices to go much higher. This is fantastic for Putin and Russia because Russia is broke. #TrumpRussia
8979 2018-05-09 10:48:53  saved millions of $ on oil and other resources you mean

8985 2018-05-09 10:48:07 We all better hope no oil at 100+, consumer spending will absolutely suffer
8986 2018-05-09 10:48:01 The Ruia family spent billions $, 20 years and countless govt. favours and bank loans to build Essar Oil to sell it to Roseneft for $12.5 billion. The Bansals built a company in less than 10 years with zero debt and sold it for $20bn with zero help from banks or govt.
8987 2018-05-09 10:47:59 #WTI we spent most of last year at an average of around $50 a barrel  oil stocks are doing well but now at 70 with US interest rate / inflation increasing wage demands up this must have a drag on growth/profits....i realise it takes time to play out but imo index drops are coming
8988 2018-05-09 10:47:56 Umunna is nothing but a two bit salesman  ?????

8989 2018-05-09 10:47:17 if you find me unattractive then congratulations bish your boredom level just found oil
8990 2018-05-09 10:47:15 But wait - there’s more!!! If you act now, we’ll throw in emoluments clause violations and foreign policy decisions intended to drive up the price of oil for cousin Vlad, all for the ridiculously low price of: $500,000.00!!
8991 2018-05-09 10:47:08 Considering Iran doesn't supply us with hardly any oil, it shouldn't affect us at all. Any problems that they may try to create, can be resolved by our navy.
8992 2018-05-09 10:47:07 Canceling the deal with Iran is raising the risk of further conflict in the Middle East and threatening to disrupt global oil supplies. Oil prices are rising. All know the deal needed improvement but it is better than nothing. What is plan B now to thwart nuclear ambitions?
8993 2018-05-09 10:46:50 I think they will, the US market is worth much more to Chinese exports & they already import oil from the Saudis so they'll just double their order. But they won't be happy about this, Iranian oil could be depended on, while Saudi oil has been used to serve US's interests.
8994 2018-05-09 10:46:46 I know!!!Maron try help to Putin with oil price,dump to up
8995 2018-05-09 10:46:44 @vrevmcr Are you guys palm oil free?

8998 2018-05-09 10:46:15 This!!!! Also the point about palm oil. Palm oil is not an animal product and saying it’s not vegan is fundamentally wrong
8999 2018-05-09 10:46:03 Run off at the mouth when the real story here is Donald Trump's attempts at pleasing Russia with higher oil prices. Americans will be paying for his foibles.

9020 2018-05-09 10:42:59 My father always thought that the carpet bombing we did in Afghanistan was nothing more than clearing the rugged terrain to facilitate a pipeline from the Middle East to Russia for oil and gas.  Bush - Obama - Trump  3 bombs every hour / 24 hours a day.

9023 2018-05-09 10:42:14 The biggest winner in the US pullout from Iran: Russia. Crude oil prices have been rising ever since 45 said we would pull out. Low oil prices have been killing their economy. They making Mo eh now...unintended consequence? Or premeditated m?

9026 2018-05-09 10:41:54 If we’re now transporting our “excess” oil why should this have any effect on our price of  oil.
9027 2018-05-09 10:41:53 JUST IN:  Our oil hits $77 per-barrel in the world market for the first time since 2014.
9028 2018-05-09 10:41:42 @CNBC And to get his chance to "take the oil".
9029 2018-05-09 10:41:39 ... aaaaand, oil prices triple in ... 3,2,1 ...
9030 2018-05-09 10:41:38 1) They all want Iran's oil. They put gain first (greedy bunch), bad example. No one should beg evil, instead, u fight evil with boldness.
9031 2018-05-09 10:41:19 Obama thought he found the cure to cancer- made a nice 2 Billion cash donation to cure the cancer-then the cancer center kept the money and did nothing to rid the cancer. BHO squandered our money on a snake oil cure. Then big daddy DJT callled bullshit.
9032 2018-05-09 10:41:03 So, "no comment" means that Saudi is selling oil to the Israeli & the Israeli products are everywhere in the saudi markets? & there are Saudi officials in Israel & vise versa? & Saudi votes in favour of Israel in the UN?
9033 2018-05-09 10:40:47 I have a fresh piece of salmon in the fridge lol what oil you referring to ?
9034 2018-05-09 10:40:44 As the use of data gets scrutinised and regulated the question is whether it will remain the new oil? While data will be a company's biggest asset, it will gravitate toward internal utilisation only.

9037 2018-05-09 10:40:37 What kind of oil is that
9038 2018-05-09 10:40:30 The last time similar (UN) sanctions were imposed in ‘06, oil went from $60 to $145. Many more moving parts then obviously but will not remain silent on this, right? EU is invested.
9039 2018-05-09 10:40:21 John McCain is a Republican.  Trump is just a corrupt snake oil salesmen that took over the last vestige of what remained of that party.

9041 2018-05-09 10:40:04 The thing is though, if war with Iran happens then the Straights of Hormuz will be blocked and oil will stop flowing. Then this spike in weapons stocks will be a blip on the downwards spiral to hell the West faces....

9045 2018-05-09 10:39:45 But there are plenty of bad reasons-isolates U.S. from EU, which is what Putin wants. Added benefit to Russia of increasing oil prices...

9050 2018-05-09 10:38:46 Iran actually didn't need to order so many large passenger planes, which had been estimated to benefit only 5% of the Iranian population.

9066 2018-05-09 10:36:19 I’m still wondering how Carl Icahn fits into this and is the motivation behind Iran higher oil prices for Russian and American businesses?  I have so many questions.
9067 2018-05-09 10:36:17 In unrelated news we have a ton of oil that's just burning a hole in our pockets (should have invested in barrels I know). Anyone want some? Competitive prices. Ask for Derek.

9069 2018-05-09 10:35:52 Isn't everything about economics? Oil prices getting higher, with applauses from the fracking guys. Instability brings opportunities to use army and weapons, with applauses coming from the 'gun team'. So let's never forget that Mr. Orange Head's decisions also follow the money...
9070 2018-05-09 10:35:36 Trying everyway possible to make sure the US stay depended on oil.
9071 2018-05-09 10:35:36 The other issue is the ad-hoc nature of the approvals. It needs to be defined by law so it’s not subject to how FG or Governors feel. Anyways, if they have added $500m in 3 years that’s quite good considering oil prices in same period.
9072 2018-05-09 10:35:06 on 31 Jan when @i3energy described possible funding terms, Brent was <$68 and gbp/usd rate was 1.42. Today, Brent is $77 and gbp/usd is 1.35. So oil in Liberator is now 20% more valuable to a gbp investor. Improved funding terms on the way? #i3e

9083 2018-05-09 10:33:51 Trump is compromised and owned by the Russians who want this deal dead for higher oil prices and instability in Europe etc. So much progress made and now Trump is lying about Iran. That's the end of peace in the Middle East
9084 2018-05-09 10:33:36 No, Donald high oil prices are good for your master, Putin. He ordered U to end the deal. Oil prices have already doubled since you started talking about leaving the Iran deal. That's bad for America but Great for Putin and Russia. And that's all that matters to you. #TrumpRussia
9085 2018-05-09 10:33:27 How about imposing sanctions — i.e. reducing whatever relief iran might have experienced from the deal — for those wrongs instead? Puts iran in a corner and gives them (and others) less to complain about. Also less collateral benefits to russia for higher oil prices
9086 2018-05-09 10:33:21 The US withdrawal from the #IranDeal and the re-introduction of sanctions is expected to hinder oil exports from the country in an already tense global market. As a result of this Crude oil prices jumped to new 3.5 year highs.
#Brent #WTI #OOTT #Oil #EnergyMarket
9087 2018-05-09 10:33:16 And driving oil prices up for his lord, master, & owner Putin, whom he worships & adores.
9088 2018-05-09 10:33:11 The good news for oil producing states is that prices are going up.
9089 2018-05-09 10:33:08 We give iran 2 billion dollars as kinds hush money so they dont make nuclear weapons and there are no sanctions....we pay the bad guys to not do something why sjould we pay the richest people in the world with their oil they make enough money maybe they pay us now

* Oil Prices to skyrocket

9095 2018-05-09 10:32:25 Gov Phil of NJ here.  I agree with you Tim.  We leftist democrats demand the president uphold a symbolic deal that doesn't stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons and lets them finance it with oil revenue.  After all, we screwed up N Korea too.

9098 2018-05-09 10:31:42 @KattyKayBBC says”It seems to me Iran will start-up the centrifuges again.” That would be a major mistake, BY IRAN!

President Trump's decision to reinstate Iranian sanctions threatens to cut off some of the world’s Crude Oil supply, a shift that could redraw global supply lines and require Iran’s big customers to find alternative supply.

Not buying a car because you have to pay money for Oil to a Muslim country does not sound wise.

9139 2018-05-09 10:26:39 Because he is doing amazingly stupid things, Trumpkin. 

Breaking the deal allows Iran to build nuclear weapons, raised oil prices, shredded our credibility, and gained ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for the USA.  Great deal-maker!
9140 2018-05-09 10:26:34 #morningjoe The people of Iran had the misfortune of being born in a land under which are reserves of American and UK oil. Dammit. That is why they have been targeted since the 19th century.
9141 2018-05-09 10:26:33 Oil prices set to rise due to sanctions by the US...It already rose by 2pc on Wednesday in various markets

9147 2018-05-09 10:25:58 Trump also benefits because the US oil industry will benefit from rising prices. Of course the rest of us get screwed because the price of everything ELSE will rise. The fact that many Americans are idiots and are back to buying unnecessary SUVs and trucks will make things worse.
9148 2018-05-09 10:25:01 But more importantly, it will help the Koch brothers make billions more due to higher oil prices.

9151 2018-05-09 10:24:33 If we attack and occupy Iran then Iranians should clearly expect us to take their oil fields (if we can). And we should expect our death toll will be much higher than in the Iraq war. Iran is a MUCH bigger country with a better military than Iraq had.

9167 2018-05-09 10:22:49 Of course we didn't in Iraq because after all the Americans killed there, Trump wanted out. But he clearly WOULD have taken the oil from Iraq as soon as the U.S. invaded had he been President and launched an attack against Iraq. That is what HE said. Are you calling him a liar?

9169 2018-05-09 10:22:38 wish more supermarkets would take the initiative to stop using palm oil 
9170 2018-05-09 10:22:38 @realDonaldTrump It means those buyers don’t need to do business with U.S. companies, their countries don’t need U.S. aid/support &  they’d prefer American consumers/travelers boycott them altogether.  @Reuters fails to mention #Iran is a 60% oil economy GDP size = 1 US State. 
9171 2018-05-09 10:22:36 Sad, but true.  When gas prices go up because Iran stops oil exports to the US maybe some people will see the tax breaks were just smoke and mirrors.

9182 2018-05-09 10:21:26 We have a lot to export apart from oil, but we should rather focus on building necessary infrastructure for capacity expansion and diversification first. If we don't solve our internal economic needs we cannot achieve so much. Too much attention on export led growth.

9186 2018-05-09 10:20:59 It's going to be interesting if this can confirm with the spike in oil prices caused by the US exiting the Iran deal and imposing sanctions.

See, they, like us, fought for decades to throw off British colonial rule

Then, finally, after many of their patriots died in the struggle, they gained freedom & elected a PM named #Mosaddegh in 1951

But the UK wanted Iran’s oil

9226 2018-05-09 10:15:50 God bless our military. I used to have severe PTSD. It has been gone for 7 years now. I give the Holy oil and the Extreme oil to vets and it treats their PTSD too. The doctors say it can't be treated, the Bible has the answer. Amen.
9227 2018-05-09 10:15:48 price of oil is above $71 per barrel (WTI) - highest in 4 yrs.  $3 gas is just around the corner.

9230 2018-05-09 10:15:28 Actually I've heard that too! Small amounts - not vast quantities. And butter and olive oil. The new concept is that fats are not the enemy but sugar is lethal as the sugar that is not burnt off by the body is turned into fat which then clogs the arteries + leads to diabetes.

9234 2018-05-09 10:14:40 Only if oil prices go up does the dollar value go up. So naturally #Trump is rescuing US economy. Well played. Nuclear ban etc all eye wash. #NuclearDeal
9235 2018-05-09 10:14:32 Either they have gone soft or the oil has gone rancid......or the worst combination - both!

9237 2018-05-09 10:14:26 Oil is rising. Putin is happy.
9238 2018-05-09 10:14:21 US invaded a sovereign country on false claims of WMDs,slaughtered million people,turned a prison to torture+humiliation centre,looted museums,oil & gold reserves. Then left,leaving room for ISIS to thrive, only to come back & loot again. All in the name of democracy.What a joke.
9239 2018-05-09 10:14:15 Our oil prices went up, Iran gets to resume building nuclear weapons, our international reputation is shredded, and we gained ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

Explain how that is good for us.

9241 2018-05-09 10:14:06 I'm in full agreement with you. This move by the head clown has thrown the oil market into chaos. Lol prices will continue to inch upward. I bet the Trump org. owns oil stocks and will reap large profits.

9243 2018-05-09 10:13:50 Gold prices fell to their lowest in almost a week, as the dollar strengthened after U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to pull the United states out of the Iran nuclear deal boosted oil prices and pushed Treasury yields higher.
9244 2018-05-09 10:13:48 Saudi Arabia will be rubbing their hands together thinking of more oil dollars for them.

9249 2018-05-09 10:13:08 Oil prices soared to new highs Wednesday morning as the US officially withdrew from the JCPOA and will re-impose sanctions on Iran, targeting the country’s oil & gas sector, oil exports in particular, which bring billions of dollars to Iran.
9250 2018-05-09 10:13:01 Sherwin Straker - Good Oil
9251 2018-05-09 10:12:33 Because the Zionist Jews want war in the Middle East they want control of there banks and oil like they have control of our western banking system
9252 2018-05-09 10:12:33 Haven't heard any talk of bombing. The voices in your head again? Vast right wing conspiracy?
9253 2018-05-09 10:12:17 Seems to be a great deal for Russia and Saudi Arabia by pulling out of Iran deal?  As oil prices rise money flows to oil rich countries.
9254 2018-05-09 10:12:06 Since the Saudis benefit from your much needed cancellation of this terrible deal they should have OPEC increase production to offset the loss of Iran’s oil.
9255 2018-05-09 10:12:05 There is only ONE reason gas is expensive GREED! WE America refine more gasoline than any nation,we surpassed Saudi Arabia in oil production,so I blame GREED!WE do not need the Middle Eastern oil we have plenty tucked away in Alaska,and off the Gulf Coast
9256 2018-05-09 10:11:56 @cthagod thank you for explaining the iran deal just now... has nothing to do with gas... all about nuclear weapons.. and to inform u by 2020 or 2022 usa will be the #1 exporting country of oil.. hence we will be ok
9257 2018-05-09 10:11:47 I miss Obama. He wasn’t perfect but he did the best he could given the gop blocking his every move. It is frightening how far we have fallen and how crass we have become under this man.
He hurts all of us. Did you see as a result of pulling out, oil prices spiked?
9258 2018-05-09 10:11:38 I suggest you look up the deals that the US has also made. Boeing providing aircraft  of over $ 17bn,, General Electric and oil companies to name a few. .  US  will lose thousands of jobs.
9259 2018-05-09 10:11:21 Let’s all remember #trump wanted some of that oil in #Iran #IranDealWithdrawl
9260 2018-05-09 10:11:19 because operating boats that leach oil into the water makes sense

9264 2018-05-09 10:10:59 Who benefits when Trump destabilises the oil market by ending the Iran deal? Putin. Russia is broke & depends on oil. Since Trump's been talking about pulling out, oil prices have more than doubled. Bad for America but great for Russia, & that's all Trump cares about #TrumpRussia

9273 2018-05-09 10:09:52 Elite class ki aunties are so cute. A few days ago, one of them was so offended that upscale restaurants serve garlic powder and chili oil which according to her is such a paindu/urdu medium type thing to do.
9274 2018-05-09 10:09:49 No wonder Wahhabi Fundamentalism originated in Saudi Arabia. You have to spend all those oil trillions on something else besides just gold toilets,

the profit from ensuring mullahs stay in place must be huge judging from the depth of media campaign to justify the indefensible. is it more than oil reserves in play? is there another agenda?

9280 2018-05-09 10:09:11 You know what, I am just talking about India. Prices at which they get the crude oil is different from what they sell. State and Central Ministers/govt imposes huge taxes on them, that's why prices are higher.

9287 2018-05-09 10:07:40 Explain the "thinking" behind it? other than Putin wants Iranian oil out of the market. Iran was complying fully with the deal so it makes no sense. What is Trump tryig to achieve in NK if not the very thing Iran was doing?

9300 2018-05-09 10:04:43 Hey what about Israels nuclear weapons? are they not dangerous already? they've had them for years, come on be honest its just the global puppetmasters wanting to get rid of Irans leadership and get the Oil and natural resources there just like in Iraq, Libya etc.

9323 2018-05-09 10:01:42 Is Iran the next Iraq or Syria in the making?
With the US scrapping the Iran nuclear and imposing fresh sanctions on it could well lead to oil prices skyrocketing.

9363 2018-05-09 09:56:30 Haha you wish bud. So far Avenatti has been correct on every single one of his predictions. But you shouldn't be worried about him, worry about Trump pulling out of the Iran deal, we'll all be drafted to fight in a bullshit oil war in a year or so.
9364 2018-05-09 09:56:19 What World's Top Oil Buyers Can Do to Tackle Trump's Iran Action - Bloomberg
9365 2018-05-09 09:56:04 Where's the proof that Obama gave the Iranians $billions? The deal released money held by sanctions, that ALREADY BELONGED TO IRAN, for cruel oil sales to Shell. $150bil, that Trump claims is way off too. This deal would only release a fraction of that amount, of IRAN'S MONEY .
9366 2018-05-09 09:56:01 Something is up, my gas ain’t lasting for shit and my car is saying it needs an oil change a month and a half early
9367 2018-05-09 09:55:59 Name one steel company... Just one. Same for coal... Oil companies are NOT hurting for production. You're thinking of greed. So in that case you are correct. More $ for Opec. #IranDeal #TrumpResign #WorstPresidentEVER #TrumpCrimeSyndicate
9368 2018-05-09 09:55:57 i said its all about a big oil deal from Jan. 20, 2017.
9369 2018-05-09 09:55:54 Listening to Dr Mary Flynn talk about the phenols of EVOO (extra virgin olive oil). It’s not the oil’s high ratio of mono-unsaturated fatty acids!

9374 2018-05-09 09:54:35 RBI brought out the big guns with the OMO purchase announcement. Yields on 10y back up to 7.71% though on the back of higher oil prices.
9375 2018-05-09 09:54:30 Great work by New Britain Palm Oil Ltd  we are pleased to work closely with members to drive change. 
9376 2018-05-09 09:54:20 Hi @parnonoliveoil we sat in on a blind tasting olive oil panel a while back. Fascinating sampling the different oils. So many flavours to enhance dishes, and good for us.
9377 2018-05-09 09:54:18 "Nothing unprecedented about today's climate".. I would argue the level of snake oil alarmism is unprecedented.
9378 2018-05-09 09:54:17 I too thought this would be the classic sell the news situation but didn’t sell and added as it was too obvious. Now look  oil up 3%
9379 2018-05-09 09:54:16 Nigeria's foreign reserve higher than that of South Africa... Let's see what happens to Nigeria if eventually  OPEC is forced to reduce the price of oil.

9380 2018-05-09 09:54:15 Just follow the money on oil, tax etc. And you will get the picture
9381 2018-05-09 09:54:10 A muslim nation helping another nation of Muslims.... if the US and other western imperialist had their way Iran won’t have oil at all... like Libya like Syria and like Yemen, they seek to reduce Iran to ashes.... even those exploiters have poverty in their backyards...
9382 2018-05-09 09:54:04 The EU also now imports 40% of all of Iran's oil, and imports from Iran to EU have increased sixfold since the deal... That's in less than 3 yrs. Follow the money.
9383 2018-05-09 09:53:47 Well  the exhibit will be related to Qatar mostly and talk about Qatar people how they lived before discovering the oil  ?  And most of the antiques related to Qatar  And yes I like to be part of the museum why not if I have the chance again

9390 2018-05-09 09:52:05 @RebootWithJoe A great tip for your Juice followers to avoid long clean ups and stains on the Juice maker machines from things such as turmeric, beetroot, carrots etc, is to smear a little olive oil, or vegetable oil on the clear plastic parts or white plastic parts prior juicing
9391 2018-05-09 09:52:03 There’s no need for fracking. We have enough oil and we need to be developing green solutions. It took over 100 years to clean up the last shale oil mess in West Lothian
9392 2018-05-09 09:52:00 And what say you of Saudi Arabia or has their oil lubricated your mind to a point where you too can be accused of selling your soul

Crude oil may hit $80 per barrel soon, earlier this headline use to surprise me. But now, it seems that the day is not too far away!
9457 2018-05-09 09:44:27 Oil prices are up! Gas is up! Thank you @realDonaldTrump! You have erased another @BarackObama eight year achievement!

We are now assured of continued chaos for a decade or more after your impeachment! Your record of bankruptcies is about to become real.
9458 2018-05-09 09:44:06 I would agree. Hawkish hold the most likely outcome but investors cannot dismiss chance of dovish hike given recent #oil & #GBP are inflationary heading into H2. @KallumPickering is right on construction impact on Q1 - however recent M4, retail sales & house price data all weak.

9498 2018-05-09 09:39:08 MEDIA, trump did what he did with the  Iranians for no other reason other then to increase the price for a barrel of oil, him and his friends have large investments in oil.
9499 2018-05-09 09:39:01 Russia’s because biggest problem is their severely depleted foreign currency reserves. They desperately need an increase in the oil and gas prices to bolster their reserves so they can trade on the foreign market. The disruption to Iran pushes them closer to Ru, which is a bonus.

Vlad wants:
1) Chaos
2) Weak U.S.
3) War - oil prices up and all Russia has is oil

9510 2018-05-09 09:37:56 The US has a surplus of oil. The US has enough oil to export it for the first time in history. Oil prices should be dropping per the US surplus and the tax cuts kicking in to the US big oil companies. Rigged system otherwise. Follow your common sense.

9526 2018-05-09 09:36:08 What was the price of oil and it's movement leading up to the end of UPA? What was the average cost of India's oil basket 2010-2014? And what was it in the last 4 years? That will give you a clue as to relative economic performance of Dr. Singh's government and the current one
9527 2018-05-09 09:35:54 For all of you not Scandinavians. Norway stole oil fields from Denmark (granted our negotiator was drunk)

9530 2018-05-09 09:35:25 If we stop exporting American oil and only feed our market of customers, maybe our gas prices would go down. Big oil needs to uncap all the wells that are capped.we only make OPEC richer and Americans poorer when oil is so pricey.

9540 2018-05-09 09:33:19 Seems a handy coincidence that oil spikes in price just as the Saudis are trying to float the largest oil company. How much value is driven by the delta of oil prices? It's not chump change, but rather 'real money'.

Regarding your $20 a barrel post- it reminded me of lunches at the Petroleum Club where the price of lunch reflected the cost of a barrel of oil.

9631 2018-05-09 09:20:03 The more important question is "Who wins?" @realDonaldTrump 's decision will likely boost the Russian economy as the price of their oil will increase.

9633 2018-05-09 09:20:03 @SullyCNBC Looking at the oil price chart you just put up and @POTUS determination to rip up the #IranNukeDeal (and thereby drive oil prices higher), has anyone discussed how the benefits the Russian economy and helps bypass the crippling effects of sanctions?
9634 2018-05-09 09:19:46 Most developing nation was caught off guard by the rapid increase in oil which contributes a large part in the supply chain. Poorer countries will immediately feel the impact while richer ones can manage.
9635 2018-05-09 09:19:44 1 ml of oil will be more valuable than one gram of gold one day

9637 2018-05-09 09:19:29 Mr. President, what do you mean “No Collusion”? Your guys are tripping over Russians every time they turn around. By the way, has Vladimir thanked you yet for pulling out of the Iran deal? He’ll be pleased you weakened NATO and pushed up the price of oil. You’ll get a gold star.

9654 2018-05-09 09:16:59 Oh but it's spot on though. Israel pushed for war with Iran, Israel and Saudi Arabia are very close allies, Saudi Arabia and Russia are very close oil tycoons.. Every recent event from Scott Pruitt deregulating our corporations to ending the Iran deal.. All oil linked.
9655 2018-05-09 09:16:59 God! “Religion is the impotence of the human mind to deal with occurrences it cannot understand.” ~Karl Marx. Oil is running out & different brands of capitalism at each others throat to make sure they have it all.
9656 2018-05-09 09:16:48 American fracking loses money if oil is below If I remember rightly $46 pb.

Then you realise the state of the game in oil producing Arab states , more so if they dare talk about removing sales from the dollar standard , as Iraq and Libya found out to their peril.
9657 2018-05-09 09:16:43 Brent 77 $/bbl
And dollar has strengthened 5% against euro in past 2-3 weeks
Oil is a lot more expensive for Europeans, and I think this is only the beginning.

9668 2018-05-09 09:15:41 With Indian oil basket heading towards $80, there is pressure on the trade deficit and domestic inflation. This puts further pressure on the rupee and pushes inflation further. Not great for those hoping for lower yields.

9685 2018-05-09 09:13:12 You call that evidence? The US is repeating the Iraq invasion mistakes and guess what, in the end Iran will turn out to have not cheated in the deal, just like how Iraq never had chemical weapons, y'all just want the oil and natural gas.
9686 2018-05-09 09:13:08 Of course, this is why Russia put Trump in office. Oligarchy wants to control resources. Oil investments funded by bank loans are due and they need huge return on investments soon.

9688 2018-05-09 09:13:02 IMO, we r forgetting another major angle: Saudi & Oil. By boycotting 3rd largest supplier, oil will surely going to boil. Major beneficiaries r Saudis & Shale oil of US. Saudi wants to keep Iran at bay at Syria & Yemen. Aramco is going to list. Connect the dots.

9708 2018-05-09 09:10:10 You mean like the other middle eastern countries the US has 'freed'? In case you haven't noticed that's not working out ANYWHERE. It's never been about freeinf the people and helping them rise up, it's always been about destabilizing the region & oil.
9709 2018-05-09 09:10:09 But the impact of the Iran-US debacle will be felt materially especially here in the Caribbean, especially those who's energy matrix is dominated by oil, like Jamaica. Energy costs may not necessarily rise if that oil hedge is robust enough to militate against increases.

9715 2018-05-09 09:09:20 PARIS- #AIRBUS says ti is reconsidering sale of aircraft to Iran to take into account possible consequences of the US decision to ditch the Obama "nuke deal". French oil giant TOTAL has also halted a $1 billion oil deal, pending "more studies."

9719 2018-05-09 09:07:34 The US are no more a part of the agreement. Meaning they can resume sanctions. If China follows them, the price of oil will go up. With Israel and Saudi on the side of the US, tension in the region will go up. As it stands France, UK and Germany are for the agreement.

9721 2018-05-09 09:07:02 ....this is great. At least we African continent that our centre of economy is on crude oil, can now try and live up to somehow.
9722 2018-05-09 09:06:58 Cynical reading: Japan is willing to compromise its stance against non-proliferation when it comes to securing oil supplies.
9723 2018-05-09 09:06:55 Bush went into Iraq to destabilize oil pricing because of the Bush Family’s oil deal with  the Saudi’s. Honestly I think Trump wants to go into Iran for the oil just like he said long ago to the victor goes the spoils

9727 2018-05-09 09:06:16 So if you're keeping score at home:

- Rex Tillerson and Exxon strike a huge deal with Russia
- Obama puts sanctions on Russia (specifically on oil) in response to Crimea
- Russia helps Trump get elected in hopes of undoing Obama policies (Russian economy crashed post sanctions)
9728 2018-05-09 09:06:10 India has also been building small & medium factories and were exporting those products along with agro-products to earn money fot oil imports. But corrupt potiticians siphoned off this FX eveb before it ebtered India.
9729 2018-05-09 09:06:09 One of the pros of the Iran deal exit is a cautionary rise in oil prices. 
The cons for country led by bereft people is extra cash for the 'boys.'
Sinking it's people further into penury.
9730 2018-05-09 09:05:28 Just finished listening to a fabulous piece on the Iran deal and how it'll affect oil prices, the US Dollar and emerging markets like Argentina who, was congratulated by name along with Jamaica for sweeping positive econmic reforms by Mike Pence.

9761 2018-05-09 09:00:19 Oil Prices rose more than 2 percent, with Brent hitting a 3-1/2-year high, after U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned a nuclear deal with Iran and announced the “highest level” of sanctions against the OPEC member.

9764 2018-05-09 09:00:03 Things these middle east countries do to raise price of oil

ぼくの家族と君の家族が仲良く過ごせるというのは，水と油が混ざるというくらいありえない話だ。
9766 2018-05-09 08:59:59 We’ve dealt with oil at $140 and we’re not worried right now, major airline boss says...
9767 2018-05-09 08:59:47 Subho #RabindraJayanti everyone!
9768 2018-05-09 08:59:47 A pea-sized amount of baby oil can act as a shine hair serum before dashing out the door.
9769 2018-05-09 08:59:46 ....things are just as bad there. The point about population is actually sound. But when we had the oil boom, we definitely didn't have the same number as we do now. The revenue was actually sustainable with the population at that time, yet nothing was done. You get me?
9770 2018-05-09 08:59:37 Don’t do it!!!!Never had one girl in my makeup chair that it looks good a year on. It does not age well!

9773 2018-05-09 08:59:07 Ideas, like the thoughts of a car engineer move on oil
and Now all talking about electric car
9774 2018-05-09 08:58:52 Trump withdrawing from Iran nuclear deal meaning uncertainty in  geopolitical scenario especially with crude oil prices. India can be affected with this move and as 2019 general elections coming we have to watch how Modi tackle this situation.
9775 2018-05-09 08:58:28 That moron just made war in the Middle East more viable. He’s doing putins bidding as he’s now gonna be able to raise his oil prices up so it’s a win win for putin .... trump really is a Russian cockholster 
9776 2018-05-09 08:58:08 So, you expect world class medical facilities nationwide within four years when state governors can't pay salaries and the rot discovered in the sector unexplainable coupled with a depleted treasury while oil price on a record low. Define these: "Process", " Rebuild", "Refocus".
9777 2018-05-09 08:58:06 It’s obvious that Israel and Saudi Arabia are against the Iran nuc agreement and equally obvious trump , in league with putin, Israel, SA, are cornering Iran. They’d love to weaken Iran. There’s oil at the bottom of this and power.

9782 2018-05-09 08:57:00 @PMOIndia @SushmaSwaraj India shud make a long term deal with Iran for oil and shud think of its national interest, US cant dump us for this.
9783 2018-05-09 08:56:57 True. True. But even the most basic things that the state legislature can do, are abandoned. In fact it's even more infuriating at the state level. The oil producing states get their allocation from derivation, but with the exception of Cross River under Donald Duke, things
9784 2018-05-09 08:56:56 Doesnt it make ya feel better. I had the oil out all weekend! X
9785 2018-05-09 08:56:47 Mari na oil
9786 2018-05-09 08:56:39 See...trump can do all this cause the US itself isnt at risk..but since the announcement..israel bombed syria..missiles fired at saudi...but guess thats ok cause oil prices went up right?
9787 2018-05-09 08:56:35 Fine you win! Build nuclear power plants all over the entire planet and end the human addiction to oil. #trumptweets

3. 17 million barrels of oil used on plastic production annually
4. 1 million plastics bought each minute
9791 2018-05-09 08:55:49 Crude oil climbed past $70 in New York after President Donald Trump scrapped the nuclear deal with Iran. Treasury yields advanced toward 3 percent, helping stoke gains in the dollar against the yen and EUR.
9792 2018-05-09 08:55:48 #HYR added over 9% to margins with a $10 increase on #WTI. It has gone up a further $5 since and looks increasingly likely to settle in the $75-$85 range for 2018. Q2/Q3 are seasonal peaks for revenue generation and also global oil demand.
9793 2018-05-09 08:55:44 Stupid country that wants to depend on oil till we all die i dont blame them i blame those dullards that think with their pot bellies

9797 2018-05-09 08:55:40 I think it's time from Putin to release the honeytrap video of Trump getting peed on so we can move on with our lives and not get nuked over oil.
9798 2018-05-09 08:55:23 Mehr Opec-Öl nach Ende des Atomdeals?

9800 2018-05-09 08:55:06 Guys this is no good at..but no good at all! Stock market skyrocketing #oil at $78, US yields skyrocketing..no good, this will badly end
9801 2018-05-09 08:55:00 that is inaccurate. Any full spec oil can cause a failed drug test. Please make sure to educate before giving advice. With all due respect, legally no one can guarantee a passed UA from a full spec oil. Just looking out for you #thecbdgal
9802 2018-05-09 08:54:55 2009-2014: rupee depreciated from 47 to 61...
2014-2018: it has depreciated from 61 to 67
2014: inflation at record high of 12%, foreign reserves a v low level
2018: inflation at 4.5% despite oil price rise, record high foreign reserves (cn b used to offset Rs dep. If reqd.).
9803 2018-05-09 08:54:49 Once again the population argument. So one question please. Are you categorically stating, that the revenue from oil over the years has been inadequate to "maintain wealth and the average living standards"? Because if that's not the case, your argument isn't valid.
9804 2018-05-09 08:54:43 Few mining processes have 100% safeguards. Coal, shale oil, offshore oil & gas didn't. All provided major economic benefits (O&G still does).
9805 2018-05-09 08:54:38 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
9806 2018-05-09 08:53:46 Control over most of the world's oil supply and maintaining chaos in the Middle East at the behest of Israel. We need to be very wary from here on out and watch events in EU and ME very closely (2)
9807 2018-05-09 08:53:17 I'm sure you make mayo. As I remember, its oil, eggs, and one of those wand mixers. It's not an easy thing to mix it correctly as I've seen.
9808 2018-05-09 08:53:15 Feel free to DM me and I will be happy to help you understand more. No amount of money is worth misinforming a person and causing a failed urinalysis. No oil is created equally and there are many factors to make sure the brand can provide.

9810 2018-05-09 08:52:54 What effect will the Washington's decision to reinstate sanctions on Iran have on the global oil prices? 

Different European firms, including French, have huge stakes. As of now, the EU remains committed to honouring the deal, according to a press release. Let's see how it goes

9818 2018-05-09 08:52:04 #Brent crude oil prices tick up to almost US$77/b today - up by just a few dollars/barrel compared with recent weeks. This confirms our view that the market had largely priced in a US withdrawal from the #Iran deal.
9819 2018-05-09 08:51:52 WIthout spamming you to death, I want to make sure you understand full what CBD oil is. Legal oil without a RX or living in a certain state can be obtained from pure, high quality, industrial hemp. BUT a full spectrum can indeed cause a failed test.
9820 2018-05-09 08:51:45 Oil jumps to over $76 as US abandons Iran deal, & plans highest level sanctions. We. Predicted this would hapen.

9821 2018-05-09 08:51:44 Oil at its highest since December 2014 as #geopolitics take centre stage and an already tight market reacts to the potential of even tighter supply.#Brent for July delivery is trading at $77/bbl (+15.2% ytd). However, firm oil prices come with a myriad of implications for #Africa
9822 2018-05-09 08:51:37 Capitalism at its worse. Stolen oil money, privilege in the midst of poverty & terror, corperate branding, encourages gambling justifying cheating, VAR splits the game into the rich & poor. All while clubs go to the wall.

9830 2018-05-09 08:50:19 Oligarchy needs oil prices to go up. Investments were funded by loans that are due soon.   They need to see oil go up 3x to see good returns, or lose a lot of money.

9839 2018-05-09 08:49:05 In a very real way modern Islamic terrorism is a cold war hangover from very poor foreign policies and an economically motivated string of further bad choices to gain control of oil reserves.  

The west, nationalism, and the oil economy created this problem but blames others.
9840 2018-05-09 08:48:53 Let them fire at each other, we have nothing to do with it. I am sick of the problems stemming from this region in the world - the Middle East is, and always will be due to its abundance of oil and religion, a hell-hole.

But it is not only France.

Several Canadian States
Sweden
Swiss
Others

Pure nuclear, or Combinations of Hydro & Nuclear are the most effective.

But not every country can have Hydro.

9883 2018-05-09 08:42:48 Well, North Korea has proven that if a nation acquires a nuclear weapon and missiles to launch them, they can seal a peace deal. #Iran should declare any nukes it has and say it is willing to defend its borders with nukes. Otherwise we will invade for oil like under Traitor Bush.
9884 2018-05-09 08:42:37 I'm getting more and more bearish on global growth. Markets significantly underestimate how tandem of rising oil/commodities/yields + tarrifs/trade tensions/Middle East + EM pull-back will impact consumer and corporates. And this time, there is no rescue from MonPol.

9895 2018-05-09 08:40:57 Thats your view & you are entitled to it of course. It only started off with me pointing out no matter the price of oil. As long as Scotland is dependent on WM it makes absolutely no difference, except to WM of course.

9909 2018-05-09 08:39:35 ترامپ نماینده سرمایه داران سنتی آمریکا یعنی صنایع نفت و اسلحه سازی است. تاثیر لغو برجام باعث افزایش قیمت نفت میشود که به نفع تولید Oil Shale آمریکا و عدم ثبات منطقه باعث فروش تسلیحات به کشور های عربی میشود. پس صلح آخرین چیزیست که ترامپ به دنبال آن باشد. لعنت بر تو. #untr_US_table
9910 2018-05-09 08:39:27 ..after reading several books, (such as Dubai: Gilded Cage by Syed Ali). Resources was first on my list because without the oil boom in the 1970s, the country which was at the time populated under 500,000 civilians, would not have soured to it's current wealth, "obviously"..

9912 2018-05-09 08:39:17 You bypass POTUS and travel the US meeting with state officials and try to convince companies to move to Canada. Who do you think you are?

9931 2018-05-09 08:35:27 Most of our shoes are made using organically grown cereal crops in Northern Europe to create a bio oil - we use this to make our vegan leather uppers and lining. Our insoles are made with recycled rubber. We try to use rubber soles where possible.
9932 2018-05-09 08:35:18 The conservatives don't even want to be boosting oil production because they're afraid Western companies will come in and take over everything like during the time of the Shah. Afraid of re-colonization. Moderates (Rouhani & team) are pushing for boost of oil & economy.

9934 2018-05-09 08:35:00 Big question of the day:
What does the US abandoning the nuclear deal mean to me?? 
Iran is the third largest exporter of Crude Oil. Brent Crude rose 2.2% overnight to $76 a barrel with the expectation of it raising to $80 a barrel. This could mean higher costs at the pump

9954 2018-05-09 08:32:15 But unless I'm dead wrong, Nigeria ranks among the top oil producing nations in the world and we've seen what nations with oil have done. Even nations like Japan, without any abundance of resources are more developed than Nigeria.
9955 2018-05-09 08:31:42 The US occupy the oil rich areas of the east of Syria too, and you're right about Golan Heights.

The CIA attempted coup in Venazuela shows #EmpireUSA is still hungry for oil.

KSA has dwindling levels, a few decades of oil left on current estimates.

Iran is prime target.

9961 2018-05-09 08:31:10 Sounds like a win for the rest of the world. Other countries will benefit from increased sales of oil, Iran's aging fleet of aircraft will become extinct, and their cars will die off without parts.

9973 2018-05-09 08:29:47 It has risen over the last year almost a full dollar.
Your reponse shows how clueless you are to our dependency on foriegn oil prices to this date....meanwhile contries with wind and natural gas resources depend less on foriegn oil and its pricing...
Now when are you going to...

9975 2018-05-09 08:29:29 I'm sure there are a lot of political 'longs' on oil co.s / oil futures from folks who have been in the know.  Also, who best benefits from rising oil prices?
9976 2018-05-09 08:29:05 "See how good and pleasant it is when brothers and sisters live together in harmony! It is like fine, scented oil on the head." I do not have scented oil on my head, but I have seen this effect first hand over the years!

9980 2018-05-09 08:28:05 None of the past regimes EVER sold oil (no matter what windfall) to the tune of $100-$140/barrel for 5yrs. NONE!! None of those Regimes ever stole so much the CBN Gov screamed in alarm. NONE!!! U only see what u want to see bro. All thieves must go to jail. That's all.

9990 2018-05-09 08:26:28 California-Mexico border is not the only concern. Why allow Russians into Alaska to vote on free oil?Why allow China to dump prisoners into Seattle to cut its budget?why allow ISIS to pour into NewYork for another 911? Why even check passports at airports?

10002 2018-05-09 08:24:08 Watching the news, you'd think Russia and China aren't party to the Iran deal.
I'd imagine China matters as in will they buy quite a bit of Iranian oil and are signatories to the deal and permanent security council member

10004 2018-05-09 08:23:56 They always rise and fall.  There is no proof they will rise, it is speculation.  They will go down again when US $ gains in value.  Opening new drilling in US also helps to break our dependence on foreign oil.
