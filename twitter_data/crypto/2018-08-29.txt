2 2018-08-29 23:59:38 Maxed out 401k early during this bear crypto market.  Up double digits ytd.  Now I can concentrate on the alt boom that’s about to come.
3 2018-08-29 23:59:05 Haha. Dude, I think I'll feel good about this market again once about 1,500 coins die. I need to see a lot more of the "This is fine" gif and a few billion useless tokens with no buy volume, to really feel bullish again.

14 2018-08-29 23:56:58 Who cares if people say "FUD," they already say "FUD" all the time. Who are the names?
15 2018-08-29 23:56:47 Well if you liked that, you'll love my next recipe! It's just another masternode coin, but we have a really cool, edgy name and an equally edgy distopian logo. (AKA, I feel ya, and it's put me off looking at new coins too).
16 2018-08-29 23:56:47 Wanna bet some crypto?
17 2018-08-29 23:56:22 That would be fun! I keep seeing Steve Martin  and Michael Caine doing their con jobs in Beaumont-sur-Mer.  Caine:  "But a more recent one, my favourite one, is Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.   It’s the funniest movie I ever did and the happiest movie to make."
18 2018-08-29 23:56:06 That money doesnt understand how crypto works. In these levels selling dosent work. There a base that dont sell irrespective of price. They just hold. 3 times they get fucked. February, april and july. They want it one more time. Here we go!
