61 2018-03-12 19:44:49 Promoting the use of a new currency won’t be useful if it is administered by unreliable institutions. Even if it helps to reduce the crisis, its use is limited to commodities (goods without added value), not encouraging diversification... it is a continuing initiative

103 2018-03-12 16:51:29 Agree. Finding it very odd how commodities have rallied on inflation fears only to give up most their gains without any fundamentals changing. Seems like financial institutions are vested in controlling things from getting out control.

111 2018-03-12 16:09:13 I also find it ironic you retweeted a post about the idea of no job being better than a crap job. It's through capitalism that people are reduced to being commodities, judged by whether or not they have a job and how much they "contribute".

121 2018-03-12 15:28:00 I'm really glad that you're setting these boundaries, for yourself and others. I'm generally not a fan of "celebrity culture" being an excuse to treat people like commodities - if you like someone or enjoy their work, you shouldn't express that by disrespecting them.
122 2018-03-12 15:27:29 Las retenciones son tipo de cambio diferencial. En los commodities inciden en la formación de precios internos. Si la materia prima tiene retenciones su precio interno es más bajo q el internacional, se incentiva el agregado de valor local. Sacás retenciones, se dispara el precio
123 2018-03-12 15:25:59 Yes capital has use for both pleasure & desire. It needs consumers pursue satisfactions & the dissatisfactions of the innovators. But capital is also aware that neither desire nor pleasure has much use for capital: neither its commodities nor its states of sublation.

128 2018-03-12 15:12:47 If you actually read the column, you'd know the only judgment is about the *men* in our society whose sense of entitlement dictates they treat women as commodities. But go ahead with your righteous indignation.
129 2018-03-12 15:12:09 to sum up: libidinal energy is turned into commodities, but what of the libidinal desire for liberation? is it necessarily turned into satiation and false consciousness or will the capitalist /actually/ sell us the rope we want to hang him with

131 2018-03-12 15:07:41 About the first point it is simple - Please think about what return farmers get from their products. Because of strict control on prices of agri-commodities and harassment of middlemen farmer get nothing in return.
132 2018-03-12 15:03:36 Mas ter um único setor com tamanho peso é se expor demais ao risco de mercado. Onde estão os incentivos para diversificação da economia? Onde estão os incentivos em produtos acabados? Vamos pra sempre ser o país das commodities?

134 2018-03-12 15:00:10 Yeah. Commodities are crazy these days.
135 2018-03-12 14:59:53 As we welcome back volatility. For #Commodities, it's always been there, so this is not new to the trader. But now that it's back into the general market, it will be interesting to see how the BTD era plays when general direction is not guaranteed in a range bound environment.
136 2018-03-12 14:59:33 That's one way of looking at it. Safe to say many of my neighbors do live there out of choice -- because of the "commodities" that now exist there.

142 2018-03-12 14:14:56 It's the difference between options based leverage and futures based stuff like commodities me thinks plus beyond the underlying is simple supply and demand for the shares

157 2018-03-12 13:16:41 The EU imposes higher tariffs on the same commodities. If DT should rethink (he should b/c they're bad) then shouldn't the protectionist EU also rethink as their tariffs are much higher, are a damaging tax on consumers, business & poorer non-EU developing nations. #cronyism

every single one would kill us or deprive us for PROFIT!!
181 2018-03-12 11:00:21 Of course. Because cattle are commodities/things to profit from after their lives (of misery) and (tortuous) deaths. But it's impossible, or doesn't matter, if (when) they actually feel pain, physical or emotional. (What we'd hear from anyone in the cattle industry.) 
182 2018-03-12 10:56:41 While the populace gets little benefit from the commodities and in fact actively suffers (seen retail gas prices recently?)

187 2018-03-12 10:40:00 The problem is that they’re valued as commodities and given chances that normal, less valued employees would be given. It’s disgusting, he is a representative of their brand and he should be fired.

244 2018-03-12 06:05:24 Actually it depends entirely on the situation — @sheynk would likely argue that at some point the services are commodities and the intrinsic value is tied up in the token (depending on what’s backing it!). I think that equities are too tough to enforce via tokens personally.

246 2018-03-12 05:48:34 Gusto niya lang palabasin na hindi align income ng tao sa price commodities. Eh dapat harapin niya iyun nagtataas ng price ng bigas. Bakit ngawa siya ng ngawa sa social network. Puntahan niya iyun NFA TRADERS...
247 2018-03-12 05:44:16 Rare commodities are worth more than good.
248 2018-03-12 05:31:04 It would be seen that whereas market imperfections make a tightening up of the economy difficult, the vicious circles obstruct a widening of economy. The widening of the economy involves the introduction of new factors, new commodities,

252 2018-03-12 05:09:41 And there followed them successors who inherited the Scripture [while] taking the commodities of this lower life and saying, "It will be forgiven for us." And if an offer like it comes to them, they will [again] take it.

255 2018-03-12 04:56:12 The world is flat-said Friedman. The border between nation state became very thin. Yet it applies for commodities. Human came second. Heartbreaking fact.

262 2018-03-12 04:14:37 great looks there JT. Do you look at commodities often? Do you ever trade or just look? I have seen you looking at JO several times before
263 2018-03-12 03:56:09 it's a very niche observation towards how digital economies replicate existing ones. Whereas, crafters in a fantasy game could feasibly pay resource gathers w/ real money for their virtual commodities, which could further connect virtual economies with human capital.

265 2018-03-12 03:37:57 I read up on crypto when it was new; I saw the early signs of it being a scam on investors, and I've seen it come to fruition all too often. They're designed as scams. They're not even actual currency--they're digital commodities.
266 2018-03-12 03:22:39 Just watched #ThePit on commodities futures trading on Netflix. Trading is trading regardless of market so I try to learn from any remotely related media I can find. Good watch.

269 2018-03-12 03:04:30 Is it OK to learn from older books such as The McGraw Hill Commodities and Futures Handbook by Martin Pring? It's dated 1985 or should people look for stuff mostly dated from the 2000's or just online? Thanks!

275 2018-03-12 02:22:46 The “Petro” differs from other cryptocurrencies because: 1. It’s launched by a government (Venezuelan). 2. It has its support by the commodities of the state, such as oil, which is meant to make it more reliable.   Karime Argumedo Sejin
276 2018-03-12 02:08:18 Commodities are oppressed too because they have no democratic say in their production.

280 2018-03-12 00:57:42 Problem is, if the commodities on this asteroid were available to be used all at once, their value would plummet. Supply/demand/price.

285 2018-03-12 00:45:15 it is same continuum - rodeo animals don't shed feathers from fear and stress - our toanga species are becoming trophy species / commodities- a true kaitiaki works to protect and enhance their mauri - human interaction shd be kept to a bare minimum and for the benefit of the manu
286 2018-03-12 00:43:31 Oh yeah and there was that minor inconvenience of 9/11/01 and the fact we were going into a major war in the Middle East, WMDs, etc.  and China was entering hyper speed so commodities were rallying, inflation was raging, etc. The prior steel tariff was in that context.
287 2018-03-12 00:25:45 Only an irresponsible govt. like ours does not even have a counter-cyclical payment for agriculture commodities. Instead we subsidize the rich
288 2018-03-12 00:17:23 Veamos si es capaz de repetir los números sin la economía impulsada por el gasto en reconstrucción y apoyada por un super ciclo de los commodities, especialmente con precios récord del cobre.
289 2018-03-12 00:06:08 There is so much emphasis in our world on commercialism and the ‘NEED’ not want, for more. Advertisements tell us we need these things when we really don’t. You’re one person, not many, you only NEED essentials, not commodities!  #minimalism #minimalist @TheMinimalists
290 2018-03-12 00:05:54 It not really about abstinence. It about being respectable to women. And treating them as valuable commodities for the future. We are all sexual creatures because that is how we are created. But life is about so much more.
291 2018-03-12 00:05:12 ¿Como fueron las condiciones macroeconómicas en los dos períodos comparados? (tasas de interés internacionales, precios commodities, términos de intercambio, etc)
Si se comparan resultados, también hay que evaluar las variables que estuvieron en juego.
