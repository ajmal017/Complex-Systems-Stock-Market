3 2018-05-26 23:23:00 What is the point of raising wages if all the commodities we have follow them, we need a new strategy maybe sealed price ranges on a set of goods .i.e bread milk fuel electricity gas etc with the government supplementing the industries concerned if necessary.
4 2018-05-26 23:13:07 The #TMX is about selling oil to Asia for us all to get more $ and adding capacity for oil hungry Metro Vancouver. The #TMX pipeline twinning is about adding to something that's already there, with trying to keep more tankers off the rails for other commodities. Huge Difference!!

Maybe they were honest and we don't have to express judgement for their every utterance if they don't conform to some higher ethos we prescribe for them in our lives. They know they are commodities to be valued and bartered.

11 2018-05-26 21:52:53 If you want to find the missing children, investigate everyone from the border guards who took the kids on up the chain of command and FOIA their financial records.

16 2018-05-26 21:27:13 Have always thought oil, like all commodities, was basically a demand trade. Saudis, for ex, excellent at tracking supply, they know where to find every barrel in the world, but they stink at demand.
17 2018-05-26 21:13:32 Certíssimo, ou vc acha que como está é o melhor? Antes do Brasil abrir mercados pra commodities na década de 80, eu era criança e me lembro como o acesso era caro é crítico.

36 2018-05-26 20:55:08 This is really creepy, shocking moment. It put me in mind of the Kelpien soup moment in Discovery - similar treatment of other sentient beings as commodities. Horrible.

40 2018-05-26 20:21:28 i
I look at commodities as a reflation trade...different bucket
41 2018-05-26 20:21:03 All players are undervalued in today's NFL. They are treated like commodities and forced to do/say things that make them uncomfortable if they want to keep a job. This is a very toxic way to manage personnel/manage a business.
42 2018-05-26 20:08:20 was going to make a ref like that, but then top 2 = commodities, top 4+5 = defs.  Tho undeniable weakness in staples + Utes...
43 2018-05-26 20:06:49 Some of those children are also probably being harvested for human trafficking. There are ties to trump and human traffickers in other countries. If there is no way keep records and identify them they become nameless Human commodities for the corrupt/vile.
44 2018-05-26 20:00:51 Do you honestly think the so-called investors will stay when all the diamonds are gone? Commodities exports aren't a sustainable way to achieve the so-called millennial  develop goals. Its good on paper and it sounds smart when you say it but Issa lie  as the 2000s say.. 
45 2018-05-26 19:55:21 Muitos querendo argumentar com "poder de compra de cada país".
Óbvio, mas faça isso para todos produtos. Carro por exemplo.
A conta é simples. Petróleo é commodities q tem um valor.
Se vc quer pagar menos, a única forma é através dos impostos q vc mesmo paga, não tem mágica.
46 2018-05-26 19:55:14 Infelizmente a formação de preços dos commodities, o que inclui o petróleo, não varia de acordo com o poder de compra. São valores absolutos em dólar. Abs
47 2018-05-26 19:48:11 O golpe foi contra a honrada presidenta, mas derrubou todo o país, motor de todo um continente, reduzindo-o a mera colônia exportadora de commodities, outra vez. Não escreva s ter noção de história nem de geopolítica, reitero meus votos de q continue estudando, talvez aprenda.
48 2018-05-26 19:40:55 Não entende nada mesmo!!! Pedro Parente é "só" um dos melhores executivos do país!!! Pegou a empresa falida pelos 12 anos que vcs apoiaram e apoiam!!! Petróleo é commodities, preço mercado internacional!!!!
49 2018-05-26 19:11:56 Human trafficking is wrong for the same reason tha abortion is wrong. It treats children as expendable commodities. No child is expendable.
50 2018-05-26 19:10:43 you can make a lot of criticisms about the prequels, but i really dont think you can make the argument that they are baldly commercial commodities. in fact, i think a lot of the criticism is that they aren't - that they're weird, slow, stilted, awkward
51 2018-05-26 19:05:04 3225: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
52 2018-05-26 18:56:04 Mostly due to the higher gas prices on the commodities exchange. Got higher the moment Trump pulled out of the Iran deal. The market grew scared of sparseness of oil supplies in the world.
Such a great Deal Maker Trump.
53 2018-05-26 18:55:33 they're such hot commodities

54 2018-05-26 18:49:38 These achievements do not really affect the grassroot... More efforts are needed so the common man can benefit from this government because the only language the we understand is the prices of commodities.

Pls take corrective action for #fuel prices as #fuel #inflation has a #cascading effect on other commodities.

56 2018-05-26 18:20:56 I know the prices of essential commodities if present era and i feel very comfortable today bcz i didn’t pinch my pocket that much as it was hurting me in 2014
57 2018-05-26 18:14:41 Petrol Price, Price of essential commodities, Interest rate reduction in Bank / EPF, Safety & Security, Health expenses, New Industries, Job Creation - Yes there is hardly any difference in 2014-18.
58 2018-05-26 18:10:03 No Sir, I differ from your observation. PM Modi has failed to keep his pre poll promises. Issues of unemployment, farmers distress, deportation of illegal migrants, spiralling hike in prices of essential commodities & fuel etc. etc. yet to be addressed as per his pre poll promise
59 2018-05-26 18:06:24 On technical analysis, over the years I have seen people use it to determine trading ranges accurately in commodities markets, to a lesser extent in equities. Support and resistance levels for a given time period clearly exist in my eyes. But how many TA indicators are real? $btc
60 2018-05-26 17:51:34 If human animals were auctioned off as "stock" and treated like commodities, I'd find that inappropriate too, even if the human was no more intelligent than the average cow or pig, e.g. if he/she was an infant, very small child or someone with severe intellectual disabilities
61 2018-05-26 17:43:22 の価格がS&P GSCI Index of 24 commoditiesをアンダーパフォームし、その差が過去20年間で最大になっている（2016年初を除き）。一部の投資家にとってはこの差はBearish Signだ。銅は航空機から携帯電話まで全ての製品に使われている。 (WSJ 5/23)
62 2018-05-26 17:35:01 Petrol prices are hiking, food commodities are getting expensive. Job baad meim dena pehle khana aur zarurat ki cheez sasti karo
63 2018-05-26 17:32:43 tbh tho, it feels like the politics of identity facilitate an important step in creating social and cultural commodities that can be then consumed by capitalism for financial or social mobility
64 2018-05-26 17:23:21 Tive uma ideia ótima para o @LeoJaime !!!
Vamos controlar os preços da commodities na caneta. Vamos monopolizar a cadeia produtiva para termos certeza de que a população não vai pagar caro. Controlar bem refino do combustível, para manter a segurança nacional!
O que dará errado?
65 2018-05-26 17:20:46 If you want to support BJP, do it openly including fuel prices of all essential commodities have gone higher considerably and you have an option somewhat high and only 21% people voted for it,isn’t it
66 2018-05-26 17:15:14 Except that's is literally not true. The places that are and HAVE EVER been the worst for women have been in polygamist societies. It's not even counter intuitive; multiple wives means they are commodities not life partners…
67 2018-05-26 17:07:04 Appudu crude oil price barrel price 140+$ ippudu 65-75maxx. And ippatlo middle class lo bike leni vallu entha mandhi vunnaru? R daily commodities prices or not influenced bcoz of high fuel prices? &Won't it effect common man life?
68 2018-05-26 17:04:30 crazy how things that once had a stigma of being for the lower class, are now considered luxury commodities after the span of only like a century.... like frikin’ outdoor showers or lobsters and stuff
69 2018-05-26 16:46:26 But Henrik says K winter is terrible for commodities deflation he says
70 2018-05-26 16:45:15 Hay una relación entre commodities y emergentes? Si unos suben los otros también deberían hacerlo?
71 2018-05-26 16:39:00 Public commodities doesn't eradicate social classes. High taxes don't either (unless you have extreme taxes on the rich and none on the poor)

Funding essential public commodities isn't even a "progressive" thing, never mind communism.
72 2018-05-26 16:37:35 I would imagine if “debt vanished” real assets (commodities and Pmetals) would take on some (more) value.
73 2018-05-26 16:18:37 I.own Fannie Mae commodities ' home shopping network and Internet marketing place or Internet shopping network' . Every major store' I own the malls and tge entre transportation industry'. Furniture industry ' tools ' equipment' light and heavy duty ' home and gardens   ' cooking

@dr_rita39
75 2018-05-26 16:12:32 Does corruption really hurt our economy?  The price of basic commodities has remained quite stable despite the massive looting
76 2018-05-26 16:12:02 The chain in our hands are the exchange rate, pump price, poor infrastructure in government owned institutions, prices of commodities et el I wonder if yours is different?
77 2018-05-26 16:06:03 No analizaría commodities mirando sus ETF, se distorsionan mucho por contango
78 2018-05-26 16:05:59 OMG,Honrable prime minster is suffering acute GANDHI FOBIA,Opposition calling him Lie-Lama seems to be true,last four years except blaming Nehru,Gandhis,all his predecessor what else he did,no jobs,no 15lakh,no black money,price rise of daily commodities,no VIKAS
79 2018-05-26 16:01:22 Ma, please do consider my demand for a Baon increase this 2018 for there is an increase in all the commodities we've been using and my 2017 budget for transportation might not be enough this 2018.I dully appreciate your thoughful consideration for my petition of amendments.Labyu.
80 2018-05-26 15:59:26 @timesofindia @TimesNow Achievement of BJP in 4 years Prices of petrol, diesel and essential commodities have gone sky high
81 2018-05-26 15:59:23 Mr Shah!! It’s one thing to make a promise & an entirely another thing to keep it..if ACHHE DIN is ₹ 80/ltr of petrol..s we have it..if essential commodities r expensive 2 d common man..s  it is..if grabbing power by clandestine means is ACHHE DIN S IT IS SIR!! Pls keep it up..
82 2018-05-26 15:52:20 #Bjp has been successful in raising standard of living we are actually paying more for fuel we are paying more for commodities. Our standard of living has become expensive if not successful
83 2018-05-26 15:44:44 Diversify. Stocks (Large, Midcap, Small cap, international, emerging market), Bonds (High yield, investment grade, Emerging market debt), Real Estate investment trusts, Commodities, Alternatives. Start early. Will smooth returns out with diversified portfolio
84 2018-05-26 15:39:10 UNWO distributes Ramadan provision hampers. Hampers contain essential commodities for Preparing the predawn meal, Sahr. Needy families from Sendurai and kulumbur received the Ramadan hampers at a mosque here on Saturday. #UNWO #RAMADAN #SAHR
85 2018-05-26 15:30:58 Bem a conta do governo lula/dilma chegou. Não temos commodities para bancar a gastança nem a impressão de dinheiro do nada. E ele quer fazer a mesma receita que não deu certo em nenhum lugar do mundo. E nós já estamos em recessão. Se ele faz isso, vai ser pior ainda depois.
86 2018-05-26 15:26:29 Uma das coisas conseguidas com o real, que foi lição aprendida, foi a regularidade fiscal, não podia mais gastar a rodo, imprimir por imprimir e por aí vai. Nos governos lula/dilma, fizeram esse mesmo mecanismo, mas passou desapercebido devido a alta das commodities. Surfávamos.
87 2018-05-26 15:20:05 Yeah that's really messed up, and reflective of the way that male directors sometimes see their female performers as commodities. Like, because our bodies are vehicles for the art itself, it somehow empowers these men to make comments like that. Not OK.
88 2018-05-26 15:17:35 Thats what I'm saying, the volume of commodities exported increased because they became cheaper after the currency devaluation. Same reason why our balance of trade is showing surplus and not deficit for the first time in so many years.
89 2018-05-26 15:15:10 But Narendra modi has not fullfill public needs to be cheap !
Only tax has increased 
SGST & CGST, IGST
But the rates of fuel ,gas & other household commodities has increased by this government!

But unfortunately @arunjaitley
 Ache din ab tak nahi aye!
90 2018-05-26 15:09:11 The Government can create new government-owned and controlled corporations or GOCCs that can sell basic prime commodities at a lower price to ease the burden of the Filipino people and to help combat the rising inflation.

Small stipend will be provided Interested folks can dm me with their contact information or send in your resume to navfinstrat@gmail.com
93 2018-05-26 15:00:09 1. Demonitisation (true financial reforms along with GST)
2. Implementing GST (Controlling prices of commodities)
3. Surgical Strike... Putting Pak in its proper place
94 2018-05-26 14:57:03 I am a BJP supporter but how the Govt is so indifferent to Middle Class suffering due to sky high fuel prices? GST can bring rates by at least 20%. No public statement by Govt/Party top bosses? Bound to affect essential commodities prices
95 2018-05-26 14:49:28 Haha he did mention them and I'm headed to his house right now to see if he's willing to share. Those are prized and rare commodities.
96 2018-05-26 14:43:53 What a great story. Players often get treated like commodities & this is a beautiful look at them as real people with real family issues in extraordinary circumstances.
97 2018-05-26 14:41:08 Respect on Development speed from the government. But dislike on high prices on Commodities..
98 2018-05-26 14:30:44 "o homem é um ser político por essência" Aristóteles... Eu tô cansado, muitos jênios pra pouco espaço. Se o preço do novo é o caos, acho que já está inflacionado. Logo o caos vira commodities.
99 2018-05-26 14:28:50 Por lo tanto, con estudios basados en los principios de Smith, que el “sin tax” (impuestos a commodities que “dañan la salud”, como el tabaco) simplemente no funciona y termina siendo uno de los impuestos mas regresivos para la economía.
100 2018-05-26 14:20:33 i cannot believe the “distribution” of sex is something that is being discussed, women are not commodities that should be distributed, no man is entitled to sex no man is entitled to “have” a woman and to give
101 2018-05-26 14:20:25 Yes because of price hike bin petrol and diesel put direct impact on other necessary commodities too.
102 2018-05-26 14:12:32 She was complaining about the increasing prices of commodities kanina bec of TRAIN. Dati dinidefend pa nya tlaga si PDuts...pero sumurrender na sya.
103 2018-05-26 14:08:35 (Se eu quissesse ser realmente chato eu perguntaria: "E a gasolina vem do agronegócio agora?" ou "E os insumos de hospitais vem do agronegócio agora?". Mas, de novo: o problema  é o PREJUÍZO ou as transferências das commodities [por assim dizer] de um ponto a outro?)
104 2018-05-26 14:06:12 " Chandi ki cycle sone ki seat "
Both #Commodities struggling since long 

Especially when the Ferrari #equity is on the run

Remember there was an AIF based on #Silver and #Gold 
The Arrangers to the funds have exited India after earning hefty fees

#Advisors
105 2018-05-26 14:04:06 Please don’t pass the buck on to the marketing people... 

#media has been just in the business of selling news.. just like other commodities.. 
journalists also have a more than equal stake in this mess..
#radiatapes are a good example of how journalists were into deal making
106 2018-05-26 13:53:04 While they are playing they need to take that money and make it work for them so they aren’t continually beholden to those owners who see them as nothing more than commodities.
107 2018-05-26 13:41:16 They reflect on those civilians that produce, Market and export those commodities. The multiplier effect is even unthinkable. When exports increase, it means demand increases - income increase -puchasing power increase - More demand - More output and the cycle continues.
108 2018-05-26 13:36:17 1. How do you measure stability?
2. For a lot of commodities supply and demand are in fact related. Ever heard of price elasticity of supply?
109 2018-05-26 13:33:20 Bibhuti mishra 
 With the rise of the price of oil
Prices of overall commodities will  go high .
So it will become hard to cope up with the situation for common people. 
 In this 4 years of rule of BJP people received  everything in negative terms and lastly INFLATION as a gift.
110 2018-05-26 13:32:53 O Brasil é autonomo em relação ao Petróleo mas o BR exporta petróleo bem baratinho e compra Diesel caro por que: UAU COMMODITIES VÃO SALVAR O BR e SE PEITAR O MERCADO A GENTE DERRUBA AS AÇÕES CUIDADO COM O BIXO PAPÃO DAS AÇÕES EIN.

113 2018-05-26 13:16:34 Ou você aceita que petróleo é commodities e que custava o mes passado 48 dolares e este mes custa 86 o barril e aceeita a lei de mercado que por sinal é  unica . ou vai viver na Venezuela la o petróleo esta 19 centavos o litro so que tem que aguentar o  Maduro a falta de comida
114 2018-05-26 13:12:59 Some would counter that and say its to make money from them. Each student is worth around 5000 funding. It could be construed they are commodities. Rather like private training providers make lots of money training prisoners. More prisoners, more money.
115 2018-05-26 13:12:48 Bakwas.
You doomed our economy.
Doomed our country.
Youth are jobless.
Small industries suffered heavily due to demonitization and foolish way of implementation of GST.
No control on essential commodities rate.
Petrol diesel at all time highest graph.
Black money still unearthed.
116 2018-05-26 13:11:50 Opinions are the cheapest commodities on earth!
117 2018-05-26 13:08:04 The players in professional sports leagues are literally irrelevant.  You could get 22 guys from Newark to start for any NFL team and as long as quantitative markets are made on them, the TV ratings wouldn't miss a beat. No one cares about these disillusioned commodities #PASPA
118 2018-05-26 13:01:43 With enough MONEY you don’t have to bother unlocking closed doors, you can just create new doors and pathways to the commodities.  ABUNDANCE for the masses will not create “Inflation.”
119 2018-05-26 12:54:27 We expect TRAIN to boost govt spending & generate jobs. Even without it, prices of commodities will rise. Oil prices alone are heavily dictated by supply coming from a volatile Middle East.
120 2018-05-26 12:53:35 During the four years of Modi led BJP Government India has witnessed only price hikes of fuel and daily commodities, murder of democracy, unemployment, farmer suicides, corruption, looting people’s money etc. Tripura Pradesh Congress, NSUI, Youth Congress, @BjpBiplab
121 2018-05-26 12:52:48 congratulations to PM @narendramodi and team @BJP4India for successive and great performance of copletion of 4yrs rule. Henceforth please concentrate of further reduction prices  of essential commodities & bring PETROL&DEISEL UNDER ""GST"". @dpradhanbjp
122 2018-05-26 12:52:03 Empower yourself by being stronger than the capitalist urge to consume addictive commodities.
123 2018-05-26 12:44:23 If house rent increase from 25 to 70, family member increase, price of other commodities increases - so how your 2 men came to you are alive. Definitely his income has increased too - a foolish can understand it Sir
124 2018-05-26 12:41:52 #DigitalTicksTokenSALE.  Digital ticks are the world's first exchange with commodities for cryptographic trading in addition to crypto-trading.
125 2018-05-26 12:40:11 Most people on Earth live in a “Poor” country and its even worst for them.  But if you allow people to acquire HUGE wealth quickly, they will find a way to expand the amount of commodities in the world.
126 2018-05-26 12:32:34 Great web! Far more detailed than my top 5! Commodities are very much interconnected, it’s true.
127 2018-05-26 12:28:21 Let’s please remember there are many people who can’t have children... right now they’re seeing celebratory tweets about kids being treated like commodities.
128 2018-05-26 12:07:45 "Celebrities are visual commodities that are packaged and distributed by the massive media corporations."
129 2018-05-26 12:00:14 Estranho isso, até pouco tempo a gte tinha um boom das commodities e os emergentes estavam surfando nisso. Agr as coisas se inverteram e os países ricos de sempre estão em melhor situação. Situação cíclica?

136 2018-05-26 11:28:35 Yes. But speculation is one of the reasons we invest. We speculate on assets eg shares, currencies, commodities like gold etc. the issue behind skyrocketing land prices boils down to money laundering ( from corrupt & terrorism proceeds) which is a law enforcement concern.
137 2018-05-26 11:27:25 4 yrs ago the economic bull was down & hurt. The govt. was trying to maintain a positive growth & battle booming inflation due to plethora of reasons

If it could levy heavy duties like those today on multiple commodities, probably you would have cried howl N foul.
138 2018-05-26 11:27:23 DTI should take action for the high price of prime commodities. is it dept of energy should take control of unli-oil price hike?
139 2018-05-26 11:19:53 In 4 years you were successful in making our lives miserable.
You increase prices of fuel even when it's price decreased in international market.
You increased taxes on many commodities increasing expenses of middle class.
Arr these the "ache din" you promised during elections.

141 2018-05-26 10:57:59 Just take a walk at a low price ration distribution centre sir duplicate and dummy permits have been eliminated resulting to reduction in leakage of essential commodities by almost 50%.
142 2018-05-26 10:57:35 This is what we all wANT:
LESS TAX ON SALARY
SALARY HIKE
LOW PRICE ON COMMODITIES
LOW PRICE OF FUEL
FREE HOUSING
FREE EDUCATION
143 2018-05-26 10:50:39 It’s just all grammar, how has all that affected the price of commodities in the market, how has it ameliorated the suffering of the poor masses... @NGRPresident u guys have failed in all aspects...
144 2018-05-26 10:23:13 Correlations move in and out..I suspect if USD moves significantly higher will probably drag on commodities more but there are many mitigating factors,  correlations are never finite
145 2018-05-26 10:21:17 To move fast on development, country needs money. We've created a society which doesn't want to pay taxes, but wants all kind of development. Should we slow down on dev by reducing tax on petrol/diesel. Pls check inflation of commodities such as food grains, edible oil etc.
146 2018-05-26 09:56:47 government officials should not waste time to think of how to change the name of NAIA. they should think how to help to control the continuous rising of oil price and and all commodities. the country is sinking due to uncontrollable rising of oil price, etc.

149 2018-05-26 09:44:00 No, they are abusers themselves and also get money from human traffickers, these children are a commodities.
150 2018-05-26 09:39:18 Human families are not commodities that sit on a shelf. They cannot be replaced, they cannot have the injustices of adults & abusive cruel treatment undone. They will carry this for a lifetime. These are injustices against humanity. We are no longer America or what she stands for

maybe he's taking care of his underworld human trafficking connections
all those babies he can supply to the market
he used to use the market himself
probably still does
certainly will in the future if USA fails to imprison him
153 2018-05-26 08:36:57 Yes it doesn't goes in their pockets, rather it goes to their personal Bank accounts & commodities.
154 2018-05-26 08:35:33 Money is fictional as well, Pavel. F.A Hayek argued that if man is allowed to control other commodities then sure he should also be allowed to control money (a 'fictional' commodity).

156 2018-05-26 08:32:52 Sir ji ...these people have no idea about the hike in petrol prices is responsible in the hike of daily commodities ...they are giving examples of coconut,Dal , popcorn, vegetables etc .....
157 2018-05-26 08:26:43 Even after his hard work  still he is not able to reduce the price of the commodities, fuel price, not able to create any employment, not able to tackle China and Pakistan, not able to control terrorism. Is he incompetent! Conduct a assessment session with him @narendramodi
158 2018-05-26 08:19:40 Not so great for the unborn experiencing the excruciating terror and pain of abortion!
Nor for the post abortive mothers. Depression and health consequences such as cancer. Little gender equality!  Women become commodities.

174 2018-05-26 05:52:42 Need to find commodities where their chart is the opposite.

180 2018-05-26 04:51:23 there are many  commodities whose price has reduced but the  fake  intellectuals like farhan akhtar who can easily afford petrol at 1000 RS per litre are crying that petrol prices have increased. These super rich sitting in their ac room are crying on petrol prices. Ironical

228 2018-05-26 00:14:26 Everything was doin’ just ok right before the implementation of the ‘Train Law. This law was ONLY created as a means to recover loses on Duterte’s initiative to exempt minimum wage earners from taxes but doing it in the expense of adding more taxes on basic commodities and goods.
229 2018-05-26 00:10:05 Further to today's drop in crude prices: refined commodities also dipped lower as did the Canadian dollar. The dollar lost more ground against the U.S greenback, losing another 8/10ths. Now sits at $1.2974 to every U.S dollar. Important factor in cracking my prices every week.

231 2018-05-27 23:53:35 Yep its a commodity, but other commodities have been used as money eg salt, cowrie shells but it creates problems due to limited supply
232 2018-05-27 23:48:20 I agree with that. TBH I think battery metals are not the only commodities that will boom from here. Most, if not all, commodities look beaten down and so many mine assets in C&M. Global stocks of critical resources have not kept up with demand. I see mining as the best buy now

235 2018-05-27 22:59:13 What I find more amazing is you couldn't explain how the market of commodities work nor how and why fuel prices have been going higher and higher since Trump took office. So whining about someone else discussing it is hilarious.

248 2018-05-27 23:53:35 Yep its a commodity, but other commodities have been used as money eg salt, cowrie shells but it creates problems due to limited supply
249 2018-05-27 23:48:20 I agree with that. TBH I think battery metals are not the only commodities that will boom from here. Most, if not all, commodities look beaten down and so many mine assets in C&M. Global stocks of critical resources have not kept up with demand. I see mining as the best buy now

266 2018-05-27 21:15:26 Not really, AZERTY is standard for French-language keyboards, among others.

269 2018-05-27 20:54:51 I mean the problem is explaining that this is a characteristic shared by all commodities.
270 2018-05-27 20:50:05 A esquerda tem um grande problema: reconhecer semelhantes. Chamam de direita tudo que não entendem ou julgam ser ruim. Jogam a culpa aos ventos. O fim do surf em commodities mostrou ao país quem eles realmente são, como afundaram a economia e como montaram uma ideologia diabólica
271 2018-05-27 20:43:07 Isso é apoio a um grupo de terroristas. Mimados por 13 anos de populismo e subsídio. O preço do petróleo subiu, isso é problema das empresas, do frete e da inflação. Não é papel de Governo segurar preços devido a alta de commodities.
272 2018-05-27 20:33:05 Palladio, please be ethical towards sentient beings animals! Stop using them as mere commodities!!!

284 2018-05-27 18:10:07 Taxes are paid indirectly. Coz commodities are taxed directly before it is sold.

Kanye's talents don't license him to act like a diva, and licensing your name onto commodities doesn't mean you have a talent.

295 2018-05-27 17:25:52 You point to one or two commodities and say inflation is very high.
Coconut prices are affected by two factors. Crop is low this year, and export is stagnant. Price will fall on arrival of next crop. Open economy prices are all about demand and supply

299 2018-05-27 16:56:43 Apart from Robert Downey Jr and Benerdict Cumberbatch it would be a stretch to class any of them as known commodities. Evans was from a failed superhero franchise, Hemsworth was in an Aussie Soap, Pratt a side character in a comedy serial and Chadwick was in serious drama.

301 2018-05-27 16:42:40 UNIP é tradable commodities. O impacto dela será pequeno, proporcioinal ao dos dseus clientes. O Dólar forte ajuda nos preços e a falta de oferta no mundo deve manter os preços altos. acho que ela se comporta como as de papel e celulose
302 2018-05-27 16:40:16 What are you saying? Tumaas ng 5K sahod mo pero nagdagdag ng 10K ang expenses i.e. fuel prices are up, basic commodities are far from being affordable.

312 2018-05-27 16:06:04 la experiencia indica q la única vez que logramos tener crecimiento y superavit comercial fue por el boom de los commodities.
Las devaluaciones reales además de tener efectos sólo transitorios no tienen efectos sobre las cantidades exportadas

329 2018-05-27 14:53:39 Agreed but there has been an abundance of horses racing at @HarrahsLADowns @DeltaDowns @EmeraldDowns that have ended up headed to slaughter and the Commission and horsemen are turning a blind eye, as they don't see horses as live beings rather fungible and disposable commodities.
330 2018-05-27 14:46:54 When Crude was Rs.40 & commodities price low did we see the surplus drive growth & Infra investment? We, I suppose  can calculate unlike the filimy types & not be blinded by our Bhakti. We find virtue in anything but criticise the Govt for anything. We cannot play it both ways.

342 2018-05-27 13:04:44 No not at all. I know the "pie" is not of fixed size. And yet there are some finite commodities like land. They're not making any more land these days, well maybe just a few islands but not much. Seriously, i've got more nuance than you seem to think.
343 2018-05-27 12:53:45 Interesting. I'm currently reading @yanisvaroufakis' book "A Brief History of Capitalism" where he describes the differences between commodities and goods. We need to remember and cherish non-monetary experiential goods as much as the products buy.
344 2018-05-27 12:50:48 A queda de preços no brasil é com redução de impostos e diminuição de despesas do governo. O problema é andar meio caminho, estabelecer preços de commodities globais sem retirada de impostos para uma nação que tem renda do trabalho pífia, na casa de 4 centenas de dólares.

353 2018-05-27 12:18:59 You just made the case for the fact that progressive governments who announce that commodities are rights are mistaken. However you haven't made the case that because few or no other governments recognize the rights to rvlution and persnl self-prsrvtion, those rights don't exist.
354 2018-05-27 12:16:40 So your party increased price of petrol and diesel which is leading price rise of all essential commodities and killing aam aadmi of country.
355 2018-05-27 12:07:24 @dpradhanbjp ,Petrol and diesel must be imm  brought under GST , this will make these essential commodities pricing down by 8 to 10 rupees min . State and Centre must come forward and secure people’s rights imm .#FuelPriceHike ,#gstcouncil

357 2018-05-27 11:58:30 Agree with u Sir, otherwise price of all commodities in daily life also increas with petrol hike price.

359 2018-05-27 11:43:04 Hot commodities. Everyone wants them
360 2018-05-27 11:33:43 The reports are useless and doesn't make any sense when it comes to the current market price of those commodities for common Nigerians... Exporting what is not sufficient for the people??
361 2018-05-27 11:07:27 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
362 2018-05-27 11:07:26 Today defence people get almost free liquor and commodities at throwaway prices in canteens. Today they get to holiday in prime locations like South Mumbai and Goa for a price of Rs. 25 per day (check for yourself the hostel fees for SoBo navy hostel) and so many other things...
363 2018-05-27 11:03:12 Dear Avni, 13000 innocent investors including PSUs like MMTC and PEC were cheated of Rs 11000 crores in #NSEL fraud, promoted by FTIL. #NSEL issued investors contract notes with 0 commodities in warehouse. You should not be selfish, and support the court order.
364 2018-05-27 11:01:28 What I like about living in the province is that you'll have a greater chance of living a healthy life, both physically or not. Less pollution, healthier (and also cheaper) commodities.
365 2018-05-27 10:55:12 Fuel  Prices increased 14th straight Day Today (27 May) #Petrol cost Rs 81.11  and #Diesel Rs 72.91 per litre in Chennai. Increase in other commodities soon..
366 2018-05-27 10:41:31 People say Muslims oppress women when America be selling women’s bodies on TV like they are commodities, lmfao good one this country is what objectify females.... and from all social media, seems like females don’t care if they are objectified because they need to fit in
367 2018-05-27 10:24:54 ..please do something useful with your life instead of sitting at your desk and betting on commodities / currencies like observers in an ivory tower..
368 2018-05-27 10:18:36 What taha said has been true for as long as I can remember. Doesn't matter how available ir scarce commodities are, here in the north they're always more expensive in ramadan

When most people think about trading, they either consider the commodities market ,eg the market or they think of trading Foreign exchange . 
One fascinating way that you may want to think about trading in gold is by doing some option dealing.
370 2018-05-27 09:58:26 good job but ppl wants 2 time meal?rozi & roti,speedy trial,corruption free society,early punishment to big ghotalawaz,cheap education  cheap medical facility and control on rising prices of all essential commodities?hope which our govt have failed to provide in its 4 years rule?
371 2018-05-27 09:36:18 Commodities are the opium of the people.
372 2018-05-27 09:28:36 Yes exactly. So d prices of fuel doesn't effect d class u were quoting but commodity prices do. D others u mentioned can afford a rs5 increase but d buyers of essential commodities can't. So important is to check d inflation. And it is been checked.Full marks 2 @arunjaitley ji 
373 2018-05-27 09:28:15 This is good news,but still there is a long way 2 go as far as making our Industrialists & Business people comply with. Improvement on ground is miniscule,as even today most items /major commodities R sold without proper bill,inspite of insisting merchants R not ready 2 oblige
374 2018-05-27 09:24:29 He is right,  happy u brought that up,  who has fixed the rand at a lower rate to other Currencies thereby causing inflation,  who has fixed prizes of commodities in SA at high prices,  Ref Competitions Commission reports. I m glad u know what's going on by u want to blame Guptas
375 2018-05-27 09:21:16 In 2014 we voted for Modi for change but when they did not formed strong lokpal, not passed women reservation Bill and price of farm commodities not sufficient despite many policy ,so think only jumlabazi
376 2018-05-27 09:17:10 listen 21st

listen everyone we are just too far away to do live animal exports. That is a fact and adding insult to injury we call them commodities so  State animal protection laws don't cover them.

Sir Ur doing a grt job ...i have been following u fr the last 3 months
Aap commodities ka bhi review start kariye na..
393 2018-05-27 08:10:27 retired from pvt companies getting no pension and also people working SMEs, whose salaries do not rise proportional to the rise in prices of essential commodities! 2/2
394 2018-05-27 08:04:29 THE MOMENT someone explained commodities to me, I knew I was a socialist.
395 2018-05-27 08:03:48 Main issue is diesel price not petrol, which put negative impact on commodities due to increased transportation cost. Can put annual charge on private diesel vehicle on the basis of  per km mileage and reduce diesel price so benefit will pass on to goods vehicle.
396 2018-05-27 07:57:45 This discussion can go on endless. Essential commodities prices r still down comparing 2past so obviously high fuel prices didn't had an impact. Inflation is down. &compare this rise with increase in salaries n u will b surprised.
397 2018-05-27 07:53:58 at first all the politician of Our country should under go treatment in these kind of Govt hospital. They think the citizens are mere commodities for votes. Its peoples mistake.. they should be in their senses before they cast their vote.
398 2018-05-27 07:50:27 Brasil colônia de exploração e exportações de commodities ñ mais atende mercado interno e acabou estoque regulador País a deriva
399 2018-05-27 07:48:04 Women are often treated as cheap commodities in Islamic world !!!
400 2018-05-27 07:47:52 Petrobrás exporta commodities  ñ mais atende o mercado interno virou uma empresa privada visa so lucro acabou estoque regulado
401 2018-05-27 07:40:28 Petrol/Diesel has to be taxed in GST. What is the logic for differential tax on some commodities? @SushilModi @PiyushGoyal @arunjaitley @GST_Council
402 2018-05-27 07:37:26 You seem to believe whatever suits you. 
Not all Africans are Negroid!
Borders are established as commodities develop. This is true throughout the world. Africa was undeveloped initially.
403 2018-05-27 07:29:22 Bollywood talking abt feminism..!!

404 2018-05-27 07:18:16 Sree Modi Ji is Good and Efficient Leader; not saving money for him and for his families doing corruption and exploiting... Only Concern is His Religious Based Politics and His Unwillingness to reduce Petrol / Diesel prices - Linked with the commodities price of the Common Man.

406 2018-05-27 07:03:40 exactly!! They’re public figures but not exactly public commodities :((
407 2018-05-27 06:59:10 but the unions are corrupt. They have learned everything after spending years of watching employers rip off people, refuse to pay entitlements. Treat people how you expect to be treated, not like expendable commodities.
408 2018-05-27 06:57:06 Agreed. However, the fact that basic commodities don’t have established value chains hinders this realization - it’s time to stop talking and start doing.
409 2018-05-27 06:56:04 It’s never about managing your finances. Try to think of the others who don’t get paid well yet have to spend more because of the increase of price, even in the basic commodities.
410 2018-05-27 06:54:22 How many Wall Street  and Banking bods are hitting the Speed and Coke whilst handling global commodities... their corruption ruined countless lives already and created the need for welfare for many as they lost homes.
US hypocrisy at work again.
411 2018-05-27 06:46:49 If petrol cost hurting you, pool car/2 wheeler or take public transport. What about savings you make on other commodities incl Pulses due 2 moderate inflation under NDA as opposed 2 double digit under UPA? @MinhazMerchant @KanchanGupta @madhukishwar @rupasubramanya @vinod_sharma
412 2018-05-27 06:36:11 Is food subsidized in Germany? The US has large subsidies for growers of some commodities (sugar, corn, dairy, etc.)
413 2018-05-27 06:34:20 67)主婦たちは物価高をこぼしている。　

67)Housewives complain about high prices of commodities.
414 2018-05-27 06:18:46 The overwhelming mood in the Philippines today is that of despondency, fear, and low self-confidence. Institutions have been systematically emasculated, some even destroyed. Economy is in the doldrums. Peso is in a free fall. Prices of basic commodities go through the ceiling.
415 2018-05-27 06:18:09 Sir! Whilst ur incessant efforts 2 bring d corrupt 2 books is most appreciated..is it a big ask if v as laymen request u 2 take up d rising fuel prices & essential commodities to bring it 2 a rational & reasonable level..v know d corrupt in India wl nor b jailed..but prices can b
416 2018-05-27 06:11:15 that's true. taxation in this form will increase even the basic commodities. but this TRAIN accounts to only .4% of total increase/inflation you see now. The peso for example has fallen lowest in decades. TRAIN is too ambitious in my opinion.
417 2018-05-27 06:09:19 Well it’s mostly left wingers bent on mind control if youre talkingvpolitical news. If you’re talking stocks and biz, well one can guess. Medical? Commodities? Coffee, is it good or bad this week? How about Eggs? You pay enough they’ll print it for you. Cronkite would rollover.
418 2018-05-27 06:05:25 Essential commodities prices have been one of the reasons when elections are lost. Wish the govt will do something very quick to address the #FuelPriceHike. Don't wait for the Karnataka Model of just 14 days freeze please. #FitnessChallenge #FuelChallenge
419 2018-05-27 06:05:04 You were getting subsidised gas earlier, again indirectly paid from your  pockets. Other than that all daily commodities like pulses and veggies prices are very low. Loan interests are all time low. I myself saved 2lacs on my different loans due to this reduced interest rates.

421 2018-05-27 05:51:01 Reduce prices of daily commodities? Aren’t you enjoying lowest price since last 4 years except for petrol?
422 2018-05-27 05:13:33 Petrol/ diesel prices should be increased, th public should pay the real price for same. Then the public will use these commodities judiciously. 

Because I believe general public has enough brain how to manage their expenses. If they cannot they should enjoy the price rice.
423 2018-05-27 05:11:10 Don't know what you mean here. The fact that commodities do not exchange at their value like in volume 1 or profit equalization among industries do not negate the law of value ( the so called the transformation problem) meaning money rate=value rate of profit.
424 2018-05-27 05:09:00 People earn in lakhs, spend in thousands or even lakhs too and crib for few hundred rupees on essential/basic commodities. Those who complain about Petrol prices, they are privileged people who would rarely go in buses or trains. What difference is it going to make, tell me guys.
425 2018-05-27 05:07:26 But abortion treats them as commodities, like pork bellies, to be kept or discarded at our whim.
426 2018-05-27 04:52:06 No increase in prices of essential commodities , black money control , GST for simplified and centralised payment for genuine tax payers. No corruption . What else you want ?
427 2018-05-27 04:50:36 The theory of demand and supply does not apply hear; the market is already saturated with these commodities no scarcity whatsoever it is just a sheer act of wickedness because they believe peopl must buy; why does countries like KSA, Germany reduce food stuffs during Ramadan?
428 2018-05-27 04:40:39 The world bank has projected 20% jump in global prices of energy commodities- crude oil, gas and coal this year. 

- Squeeze on fuel consumers in India 
- raising prospects of cramping the govts social spending.
- drag on the rupee as forex outgo increases !
429 2018-05-27 04:33:06 How so?.Oil companies decide that. Not one drop of oil stopped flowing because of the Orange baboon pulling out of the deal. Supply was constant. So....yeah but maybe go read a book? Trump is an idiot but he does not control commodities prices any more than President Obama did.
430 2018-05-27 04:24:46 No apologist for corp chains but they seem more agile than you suggest. One large(ish) player has the downtown to itself here and the offerings range from fresh, high quality, for the most part well priced to the basic household commodities… they’re good at what they do.
431 2018-05-27 04:08:38 Compare price rise percentage of all commodities before making political noise.Even rs 100/lit will not bring the sky down.If u want comfort pay for it
432 2018-05-27 04:06:40 Also getting a pet required zero paperwork, no background check, no anything for me to get (nor should it)

Im left wondering how getting guns could be easier (also not sure why living animals *should* be easier to buy relative to lifeless commodities but thats a separate debate)
433 2018-05-27 04:06:28 Tiram temeroso; colocam maia; decretam eleições indiretas; elegem Henrique Meireles, o candidato do deep state que transformará o Brasil numa Uberlíndia de commodities, o puxadão porto-riquenho dos sonhos estadunidenses. A ditadura perfeita tem a aparência da democracia...
434 2018-05-27 04:05:29 hope bjp govt have solved problem of unemployment,hunger,garibi,farmer suicide,speedy trial & have control on rising prices of all essential commodities and prices of diesel and petrol?it is media compulsion that they cant speak openly on country problem which ppl r facing daily?

That and turning Kpop Stars into commodities, and turning them into machines that only act out emotions than actually experience them
438 2018-05-27 03:55:45 Same with commodities/warehouse. Let's take up regulatory compliance a bit later. Was mastermind JS allegedly running a fraud/scam?
439 2018-05-27 03:53:48 We will come to commodities/warehouse later.

Let's keep it simple & focus/investigate whether JS was executing a planned scam as alleged.

443 2018-05-27 03:00:08 it can also fluctuate wildly, modern speculative markets on commodities like gold are way less stable than exchange rates between currencies in modern fiat economies. you track it over a week or a month and the answer will be different.
444 2018-05-27 02:14:24 He sees American land, water, and people as commodities, so yeah, you’re probably right.
445 2018-05-27 02:13:21 When it shows that the prices are rising means,the purchasing capacity of the individual is increasing,and that indicates financial stability of the country.....Mr.Modi's interpretation of prices rising of the commodities.
446 2018-05-27 02:11:06 It is declared to be the policy of Congress, as a measure of national security, to safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation’s children and to encourage the domestic consumption of nutritious agricultural commodities and other food

459 2018-05-27 00:11:40 Gasoline is a commodity which is traded on commodities market. The president usually has nothing to do with gas prices. The only time they do is when they start wars or break our word.
460 2018-05-27 00:01:59 Thats like saying POTUS has control over corn prices, oil, gold, aluminum. He has no control over these commodities! Time to retire sir, this is nonsense.
461 2018-05-25 23:33:34 Parasocial relationships are a sad, disturbing indictment of a fragmented, lonely society, combined with endless propaganda propping up these celebs as commodities to make profit from
462 2018-05-25 23:24:33 It's no longer a matter of wondering "IF" we will be betrayed to a foreign power, we already HAVE been betrayed...Our commodities, communications, health, education, financial and economic futures, media bodies, politics and cultural diversity have all gone to foreign nationals.
463 2018-05-25 23:02:47 Call de petro não é baseado em ciclo de commodities. Consideramos 65 dol o oil.

Call é fim de capex, rampup de produção e preço baixo resultando numa TIR alta.
464 2018-05-25 23:01:39 Understood. I never insinuated otherwise. This will be a long process, we should absolutely find things to follow/enjoy about it. My point is that in the ideal situation, these commodities could be moved. I know where we are.
465 2018-05-25 22:54:41 fey...trade is always a balancing act. You really don’t expect our Pres to keep all companies/commodities up simultaneously do you? Needs change.  Technology changes too.  Did u expect Obama to do that? Coal miners actually are pretty happy now.  Obama tried to ruin them

468 2018-05-25 22:24:38 Yep. Oil is one of those commodities that can easily be controlled by supply.. like other bulk commodities such as iron ore.. watch the oilers take a hit Monday.
469 2018-05-25 22:19:14 Entendi seu ponto de vista @CanalDoOtario. Mas, você acha mesmo que o #LivreMercado existe? Quem controla o preço das commodities é apenas a lei da oferta e a da procura?

472 2018-05-25 21:51:04 When you look at the commodity buying power of the dxy, we could be on our way to the double top seen before the commodity super cycle that began near 2000. Something has to give - the dollar and commodities can't seemingly go up forever. Not many like long term outlooks.

480 2018-05-25 23:33:34 Parasocial relationships are a sad, disturbing indictment of a fragmented, lonely society, combined with endless propaganda propping up these celebs as commodities to make profit from
481 2018-05-25 23:24:33 It's no longer a matter of wondering "IF" we will be betrayed to a foreign power, we already HAVE been betrayed...Our commodities, communications, health, education, financial and economic futures, media bodies, politics and cultural diversity have all gone to foreign nationals.
482 2018-05-25 23:02:47 Call de petro não é baseado em ciclo de commodities. Consideramos 65 dol o oil.

Call é fim de capex, rampup de produção e preço baixo resultando numa TIR alta.
483 2018-05-25 23:01:39 Understood. I never insinuated otherwise. This will be a long process, we should absolutely find things to follow/enjoy about it. My point is that in the ideal situation, these commodities could be moved. I know where we are.
484 2018-05-25 22:54:41 fey...trade is always a balancing act. You really don’t expect our Pres to keep all companies/commodities up simultaneously do you? Needs change.  Technology changes too.  Did u expect Obama to do that? Coal miners actually are pretty happy now.  Obama tried to ruin them
485 2018-05-25 22:28:04 Futbol > Football. Fuck NFL, don’t get your brains mashed for people who only see you as commodities not humans.
486 2018-05-25 22:25:52 NFL players are seen as commodities which is why there is always backlash when they stand up because commodities are not supposed to have voices and opinions....
487 2018-05-25 22:24:38 Yep. Oil is one of those commodities that can easily be controlled by supply.. like other bulk commodities such as iron ore.. watch the oilers take a hit Monday.
488 2018-05-25 22:19:14 Entendi seu ponto de vista @CanalDoOtario. Mas, você acha mesmo que o #LivreMercado existe? Quem controla o preço das commodities é apenas a lei da oferta e a da procura?

491 2018-05-25 21:51:04 When you look at the commodity buying power of the dxy, we could be on our way to the double top seen before the commodity super cycle that began near 2000. Something has to give - the dollar and commodities can't seemingly go up forever. Not many like long term outlooks.

521 2018-05-25 18:54:21 Crude oil2: Still room and time for upside but must consider near meeting of min obj. Will funds heavy with profit roll some into other commodities or leave gains at bank. Or prefer metals, more financials than agriculture.

524 2018-05-25 18:40:30 There's no reason to assume the inclusion of asbestos into baby powder somehow improves profitability. When you assess the sum total of similar additions of toxic ingredients in widely accessible commodities, it amounts to nothing short of a well coordinated slow genocide.

527 2018-05-25 18:36:45 E isso foi uma questão muito aprofundada pelo regime militar. A economia Brasileira fica ultra dependente de questões econômicas de nível macro, como o preço de commodities e demanda por matéria prima. Além disso, não existe economia sustentável em nível local.

539 2018-05-25 18:22:40 No he didn't, he sold off assets to forge a surplus, he had a multi billion dollar structural deficit. Harper turned to classic Keynesian policies during the recession, which was smart. But, he also got incredibly lucky commodities buoyed the numbers.

544 2018-05-25 18:07:44 NO. the commodity are ordinary commodities people buy and sell. Fiat money is money simply bz a govt has declared so. That's why you saw mutebile and museveni were there at the blockchain conference to endorse blockchain and commit to adapting to it
545 2018-05-25 18:06:30 Put the word”failed” in and you can blame someone else. The word discharge is the end of your problems. However failure to plan usually leads to plan failure but who decides what is success and what is failure. Time to stop seeing patients as commodities to be traded at a price.

547 2018-05-25 17:46:27 At the end of the day, over 90% of goods/services are commodities. The true differentiator is discoverability, which dwindles as technology advances.

577 2018-05-25 15:47:03 Harper sure was lucky to be at the helm of a commodities-based economy in that crisis, so you and other dolts can point to other countries and pretend he's a genius.
578 2018-05-25 15:43:39 1990-1992 was twice as long and as bad. 1981-82, 53-54, are also all category 4 recessions per C.D. Howe. We recovered immediately because of global commodities prices and he was incompetent in that, as per the % of GDP, just lucky enough to helm when global trends floated us.

583 2018-05-25 15:25:16 People are obsessed with quantification and turning the abstract concrete, which turns feelings and ideas into numbers that can be made into economic forces. That way we can all be made into commodities, but enjoy none of the reverence money gets.

598 2018-05-25 14:15:53 The increment was necessitated by the rise in basic commodities and due to the forex trade and import embargo. No visible effort has been done to increase government revenue this is not problem solving it's like a dog trying to catch it's tail. Why can't we do better things?

639 2018-05-25 12:26:16 You are acting as if all products and services are commodities.

641 2018-05-25 12:21:18 The economy is improving if we must say the truth. I manage a supermarket, I can tell you that there is a drastic drop in the price of commodities. Right now, we try to quickly sell off these items so we don't eventually sell at a loss.
642 2018-05-25 12:15:42 were the prices of petrol and other things very low during Congress regime? We have bought tomatoes at 120 Rs./kg. now it is 20rs. /kg. don't want to give the list of commodities which have become very cheap as compared to the period Congress ruled.
643 2018-05-25 12:07:36 Your reply would have been different,  if there would be different govt at the centre. This hike effects the life of already burdened poor people, who work hard to square meal a day. It directly or indirectly affects all the daily essential commodities which are transported daily
644 2018-05-25 12:04:53 O momento mais próspero do Brasil nas últimas 3 décadas foi nos primeiros anos do governo Lula. Chovia dinheiro das Commodities, dava pra estruturar o país. Diante dessa greve dos caminhoneiros, fica a questão: quantos kms de ferrovia o Lula fez mesmo?
645 2018-05-25 12:04:46 Provavelmente sim. Pois, o grande problema do aumento do combustível se deve ao dólar. O valor desta commodities é atrelado a valores externos. Claro, tem uma série de fatores que poderiam estar ou não diferentes agora, caso fosse um outro governo.

661 2018-05-25 10:32:11 What you describe looks more like commodities. Tokens encompass behaviours of currencies, securities and commodities. That is the whole problem from the regulatory stand point.
662 2018-05-25 10:29:39 Come May - June and one sees universities largely selling like commodities based on loans taken from banks. How come an education institution spend so much on television ads when education is not for profit. Sick , really sick . Students are real suffered.
663 2018-05-25 10:18:30 Yea, commodities are relatively expensive during the dey season. But generally, different factors affect pricing.
664 2018-05-25 10:17:54 Infact, the purchasing power of our citizen is more or less the same than in 2013 despite the inflation reducing to 1/4th. take a look at the avg. price of commodities and basic services and compare( If you are still arrogant enough to refute this).
665 2018-05-25 10:14:29 How do you achieve inner peace without money to buy basic commodities!
666 2018-05-25 10:01:51 Is #jkgovt planning to bring law for providing essential commodities to sro 202 appointees at subsidized rates.

How is petrol not the most basic need then?
669 2018-05-25 09:32:10 "solutioning is better than criticism" coming out from the mouth of a critic.
Does even the idea of an electric truck not sound funny? Trucks are what the essential commodities are transported in and due to hike in petrol prices, the price of other commodities get affected.
670 2018-05-25 09:27:08 Also the income of people has increased which has led to increase of prices. So according to you, our incomes should keep increasing while the prices of services and commodities should be same? What logic is this?

674 2018-05-25 09:12:06 This is the way of their argument. Yell about high price of one commodity, when it comes down, start yelling about another, go ahead, there are about 4000 odd commodities & you have lot of opportunities.
675 2018-05-25 09:10:21 Keep on doing what you do @albericie Emma. Australia really needs you. Honesty and integrity becoming rare commodities. You have them. Thank you for what you do.
676 2018-05-25 09:07:38 @FarOutAkhtar  You are absolutely right. The increase in fuel prices affects the prices of various basic commodities and thereby having a significant impact on weaker sections of society who do not directly pay for petrol.
677 2018-05-25 08:58:36 Yep. Complex. Loads of variables. But I guess it's human 'commodities' so unpredictable.
678 2018-05-25 08:50:58 Mr Vipin,u use public transport or bicycle, its ur choice but essential commodities transportation basically depends on fuel price. U r totally out of logics. Its very strange that people like u support price hike.

Petrol prices are the same as during last 10 years of Manomohan singhs rule. all commodities and vegetables/eatables are cheaper.Hindus are happier now

"Well, yes, we all know women are commodities, but tax? No, sir!"
713 2018-05-25 05:39:32 @narendramodi 
Dear Modi ji, it's time to consider and bring down the prices of fuel an other essential commodities.  May this not be a reason for people to vote against BJP. I am a big BJP fan and a well wisher.

719 2018-05-25 05:17:04 @republic why cannot you get the govt to reduce the petrol and diesel price now as these increase is hurting all the price in the market and all the price for commodities is going up, why you cannot force to get them in GST
720 2018-05-25 05:12:13 And your sub-standard films are commodities?! The price of popcorn has been way high for a long time, didn’t hear a peep from you.

725 2018-05-25 04:56:11 Petrol and Diesel are a few of the commodities where tax charged is higher than price of commodity itself.  Where's the accountability? @CMOMaharashtra

732 2018-05-25 04:30:49 Same reason it's illegal for ppl to sell their organs to cu$tomers. We shldnt treat humans as commodities. Legalized pros is fake empowerment. I'd rather State resources be used to assist men/women rather than tell em why not get f'd in the ass/mouth so they can feed their kids
733 2018-05-25 04:27:37 Sorry @poojathakur912 petroleum drives other commodities inflation.

735 2018-05-25 04:24:54 Hmm yes very high increase in crude oil commodities 
Dollar to rupee is high 
Inflation will go to its peak
736 2018-05-25 04:06:49 .@essential fate is proof that #Android makes even excellently designed phones uninteresting commodities.
737 2018-05-25 03:46:23 @FarOutAkhtar while ur post is quite appealing.. i want to ask why does bollywood deamand for tax free on movies like bhagmilkha, dangal, etc. This tax is also being used by govt. in various development schemes. Instead u should suggest giving rebate on commodities like fuel
738 2018-05-25 03:39:18 People who work day and night to get ends meet are more worried of tomorrow's price hike of essential commodities. they represent over 80% of the population. Believe me they are fit. They don't have to shred out those rich calories in expensive gyms.
739 2018-05-25 03:38:15 It would be inane to ask museumgoers to rate the paintings: With visual art, there’s an understanding that the viewer’s objective stance heavily influences the perception of the work. Online rating systems have made otherwise smart people view books as commodities. @legroff

741 2018-05-25 03:33:27 You are talking about fuel price during UPA, Under Modi Sarkar it breached altimeter high of UPA govt after 4 years of Congress down fall. See how other commodities has fallen including pulses.
742 2018-05-25 03:31:37 It’s not just because my wage is increasing u can’t loot the money from me through tax and indirectly raising the price of basic commodities....
743 2018-05-25 03:24:34 Commodities Check
West Texas Intermediate crude was little changed at $70.68.
Brent crude traded flat at $78.80 a barrel.
Gold fell less than 0.05 percent to $1,304.28 an ounce.
Aluminium ended 0.7 percent higher at $2,292.75 per MT.
744 2018-05-25 03:16:44 Are you fit enough to reduce prices of petroleum products.Increase in fuel prices had a cascading upward trend effect on prices of essential commodities.Are you going to accept the challenge or be Silent.AdvKiranKapoor6.
745 2018-05-25 03:10:14 I'm sorry but he never had the FUEL for it. It's like big budget marketing for feku commodities that's how he came in.
746 2018-05-25 03:03:27 Price rise in Diesel is inflationary. Traders are raising the prices of daily commodities and the feel is palpable. I get this feedback from my driver, maid, peons, watchmen and many others. The excise relief is all that is required. Perhaps a roll back from Rs 13 to Rs 5
747 2018-05-25 03:00:09 The people aspect much more from Modi.3years passed with satisfactory feeling.I think now the environment of country is as same as UPA regime like hike price in fuel , commodities, ,unemplyment,,no Ram mandir, art 37 0 etc. Modi has to make a remarkable changes to return power .
748 2018-05-25 03:00:07 An exchange economy in which most wealth, from ordinary consumer goods, takes the form of commodities, or items of wealth that have been produced with a view to sale on the market hasn’t been tried? Now I’m confused.
749 2018-05-25 02:57:41 If it wasn’t clear before, it is now crystal clear that @NFL considers black Americans nothing more than commodities to be owned and traded. #nomorenfl #nofreespeechifyouaintwhite
750 2018-05-25 02:57:09 Eleni Gabre-Madhin, she that created the Addis commodities exchange and attempted to replicate it in Kenya gave up. The cartels were too crazy for her.... especially the coffee cartels near marikiti.
751 2018-05-25 02:48:50 What about your promise to control the prices of the daily-used commodities?
752 2018-05-25 02:42:11 The manipulation you describe occurs daily in commodities and isn't strictly illegal. If I have a huge position in an issue and can force you to panic dump by selling at a discount, i can. I can't spoof or wash trade against my own orders.
753 2018-05-25 02:38:32 when did it reach Rs  100. in Past 3 years i never remember that i bought at Rs 100. I am speaking about imported onion from India to Malaysia. Govt fixing rates are for few commodities not for everything.Even swaminathan report also mentioned few not everything.
754 2018-05-25 02:32:53 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
755 2018-05-25 02:26:33 Or how I value Yuzu or Masatoshi Ono for Hunter x Hunter soundtracks. Or how Final Fantasy songs & soundtracks (orchestra included) are way much better than KPop. 

That's my point. Japan seems to regard anime, game and dramas as their selling commodities so much
756 2018-05-25 02:18:51 Oh? Do tell! I can’t wait to learn what capitalism is. So it’s not an exchange economy in which most wealth, from ordinary consumer goods, takes the form of commodities, or items of wealth that have been produced with a view to sale on the market, Hey? Well then... what?
757 2018-05-25 02:14:03 The petrol/diesel price hike ..prices of all commodities are increasing .. So is the frustration and anger of every COMMON MAN.i India only highest price petrol compare to other countries.

764 2018-05-25 01:25:30 I think another issue to look at it is the chocolate consumer base, are they ready for a Ghana processed chocolate?  If so, it should be a no brainier to build a Value Added Production system in Ghana not only for cocoa but for other commodities.

• change the value of commodities
• create new design for economies
• lead to major geopolitical tension
• challenge institutions like the UN

767 2018-05-25 01:04:53 Cleveland, OH. Big city vibes without the big city price tag (or traffic). Amazing food scene (easily on par with SD/LA/SF, Chi, NYC), cheap housing, cheap commodities (fuel/gas/elec tends to he lower on avg vs country), near huge bodies of fresh water, no natural disasters.

776 2018-05-25 00:35:41 :) That's the problem though isn't it? Don't you find it a bit perplexing that we have to rely on theoretical postulates ie: "Deep History" by Lord-Smail or Graeber, to believe in this "ascension" theory of commodities? You sort of have to believe in the whole "Standard Model"...
