2 2018-10-23 23:59:47 @SecPompeo revoking visas?  Come on.  Arrest kushner!! He tipped off saudis.  Cut off all ties with saudis.  Stop being guided by oil interests.  Do what’s right.
3 2018-10-23 23:59:46 Is that... baby oil?!
4 2018-10-23 23:59:18 Technically what your saying is oil will still be a vital source of energy.
5 2018-10-23 23:59:12 My ears are doing so good after my first stretch. No irritation or issues , I’ve been making sure to massage my lobes with vitamin E oil to help promote healthy healing I’m so ready to size up
6 2018-10-23 23:59:03 And he can’t stop selling arms to or buying oil from the Saudis because of the “heavy price to Canadians”. Wow.

10 2018-10-23 23:57:50 Talk is cheap. This is Classic Snake Oil Salesman, say anything to get the vote without ever making good on it. He'll never deliver.
11 2018-10-23 23:57:48 Use tumeric oil instead
12 2018-10-23 23:57:47 My groceries went up slightly due to seasonal market fluctuations, my gasoline went up because in Commiefornia gubnor Moonbeam Brown raised gas taxes without a vote. Gas prices also depend on world market. (Oil is $69 a barrel now & dropping)
13 2018-10-23 23:57:40 My wife: let's not use this lock until we fix it
12 hours later, My contrary self: *just lubricated a door with olive oil to get a stuck key out*
14 2018-10-23 23:57:31 Being an oil mono-producer country, the economy is way too dependant on oil and hence, dollar exchange rates, so once applied all the economic controls, scarcity appeared and many goods disappeared, the ones who still exist are way too expensive.
15 2018-10-23 23:57:23 Don’t forget the baby oil 
16 2018-10-23 23:57:16 She’ll put some Jamaican castor oil in it for him
17 2018-10-23 23:57:12 Most of the products that combat acne dry out the skin. When the skin is dried out, it begins producing excess oil to compensate. When there’s excess oil, you get breakouts. Help me understand.

36 2018-10-23 23:57:02 I'm a potato chip addict. The formula is simple sliced potatoes, hot oil, salt. Even the cheapest bag brand gets that right! Why Pringles don't adhere to that simplistic form of cooking is exactly why they are gross.
37 2018-10-23 23:56:56 頭沸いてんな
38 2018-10-23 23:56:54 A liberal dose of massage oil would seem to be in order

43 2018-10-23 23:56:33 no such thing as too much olive oil...
44 2018-10-23 23:56:29 Let’s leave the oil in the ground as well.

46 2018-10-23 23:56:10 I’m into it roasted with a lot of garlic, olive oil, and cumin. Rieke swears by a soup of it she’s urged me to try

48 2018-10-23 23:56:10 why does tea tree oil smell so bad i just wanna get rid of a scar
49 2018-10-23 23:56:04 my dad washed my car, filled my tank, checked the oil and put air in the tires. This man is a saint

本当は大爆笑したって秘密だよ
51 2018-10-23 23:55:40 Seems as such. I think just being around the oil enlarges your pee pee as well. #win
52 2018-10-23 23:55:38 WHY ARE OIL BRUSHES SO EXPENSIVE?
53 2018-10-23 23:55:32 You do realize that governments and taxpayers are losing billions of dollars in lost royalty rates, right?  If this is over your head Google what an oil royalty is.
54 2018-10-23 23:55:29 Snake oil salesman!
55 2018-10-23 23:55:12 So happy to hear you're loving the diffuser and lavender oil 
56 2018-10-23 23:55:03 Kit is from the first Dem establishment stan I've had read the script at me...

I'm actually fine w/ ppl saying that ppl should vote Dem. But they should also be honest that the Dems have utterly failed a lot of ppl. Anyone who says the first & not the 2nd is selling snake oil.
57 2018-10-23 23:54:49 Finally vocalized my depression symptoms to my family and was instantly pumped full of sherbet and CBD oil 
58 2018-10-23 23:54:46 Why not buy Canadian? We have lots of oil too.
59 2018-10-23 23:54:46 Mix in butter or oil when it is strained...

62 2018-10-23 23:54:11 Tea tree oil as spot treatment then witch hazel
63 2018-10-23 23:53:49 i need to get my oil changed 
64 2018-10-23 23:53:45 Exactly oil bill is huge now. Wish there are ways to reduce it drastically...
65 2018-10-23 23:53:44 Semi-conductors and financials are both at their lowest levels in a year, while the Dow transport sector have slumped 12 per cent since mid-September. These barometers of economic activity are now accompanied by falling oil prices — it tells us that US isolation has limits.
66 2018-10-23 23:53:36 Mom gave the dogs a bath then rubbed coconut oil on them lol
67 2018-10-23 23:53:35 Was it the same brand? That is traumatizing, when things like that happen! I made some PopSecret microwave popcorn, last week. When I opened the bag, it had some of that oil, come flying out, and got me in the face. Fortunately I have quick reflexes, and closed my eyes!!
68 2018-10-23 23:53:35 You have NO CLUE...  My RA is in remission from the nutrition taught thru @MedicalMedium .  I had a flare up that was actually tolerable with the #CBD OIL & of course I was rubbing my hands, legs, arms, & neck.   #nutrition #arthritis #health #chronicpain
69 2018-10-23 23:53:29 Now the United States can ramp up its oil deliveries and start using more wells.  Afterall we do havea large oil reserve.
70 2018-10-23 23:53:24 Well actually you do. You need to heat up raw oil to separate it into different products and gasoline or other burnable fuels only make up 10% of a barrel of oil
71 2018-10-23 23:53:21 I didn’t know if I could love @DonnieWahlberg any more....turns out I can!! What an amazing start to the cruise @dwfan4life !!! Never wash your forehead again- oil be damned!

73 2018-10-23 23:53:18 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
74 2018-10-23 23:53:15 I got my oil changed at a drive in place. They asked me to turn on my lights and use my turn signals and my social anxiety turned me into a BMW driver because I forgot where all of that was. I turned on my wipers.
75 2018-10-23 23:52:59 Scheduled an oil change for 7:30 in the morning.. df was I thinking? 
76 2018-10-23 23:52:59 Ang daming nrr- release na oil ng mukha ko tengene

79 2018-10-23 23:52:11 making projects for 7-10 year olds really making me either lean towards having them play with water and oil or design a whole computer program from scratch, ain’t no in between
80 2018-10-23 23:52:07 Well, actually, yes I do not n the 1st Wed at the church I pastor. But I’ve can use low quality oil for that. For the oil that goes on my steaks, looks like I’ve got some fraud problems. Seems that some olive oil is glorified crisco
81 2018-10-23 23:52:01 No more their oil ..not a drop.  Just US resources.  Done . Forget about sweet arms deals ...suck it up.

84 2018-10-23 23:51:24 Although it is high fat don’t think about it as focusing around fat. Focus on meats and veggies and add in fats to those things like cheese or cook in olive oil/butter. I’ve been keto for over a year and down 35 pounds
85 2018-10-23 23:51:11 Your kissing up comes from stupidity or ignorance! Don’t you think 1953 Coup, perpetrated by UK and US had anything to do with the way Middle East is today? The only democracy in ME was removed for oil - gave ME, the Shah, and then the Ayatollahs -bad for Iran, great for the West
86 2018-10-23 23:51:10 Because he is a snake oil salesman & he doesn’t care how credible it is. He knows his diehard supporters will believe it. Remember, these are the same people who feel God chose him, out of all the people of the land, to be president. Enough said. And there is a bigger agenda.
87 2018-10-23 23:50:53 ED I am said: To all nation it will be done by your own hands, mans greed care takers a few for many, many suffer for a few 1% greed. Trump no EPA oil floats upon the seas drilling in Alaska Mexico Gulf mans greed  2 at 12-13-16 Messenger!!!

93 2018-10-23 23:50:02 But don’t you think the government deep down wouldn’t do this unless it benefits the country? We invaded Iraq for control of oil fields, we allow alcohol and tobacco so it can be taxed, I don’t think they sat down and just went ah fuck it let’s give it a go and see what happens
94 2018-10-23 23:49:56 This man was fined $1 million dollars for false medical claims. He also promoted My Pillow as the official pillow of the National Sleep Foundation, without disclosing the company had a financial relationship with the organization.He’s a snake oil salesman just like Trump

96 2018-10-23 23:49:29 taxing citizens while building a larger pipeline to sell more oil to the world is not fighting climate change.  Pollution is a global item

104 2018-10-23 23:48:33 90% employment rate all due to the oil sands development. Which by the way has become way more environmentally friendly than any other oil producers in the world. The actual oil generating dictatorships have no environmental standards or human rights for workers. I think it’s

108 2018-10-23 23:48:23 Sad!
109 2018-10-23 23:48:12 Kate, Why do you keep talking about drilling for oil off Oregon as No Oil Company has ever asked about even drilling a test hole. Your problem is you can't fix the real problems Oregon has.
110 2018-10-23 23:48:10 For someone that just recently said that offshore drilling was a non-issue for #SC01 voters, @karringtonsc sure is bothered by these local R leaders that have endorsed @JoeCunninghamSC. She doesn’t sound like she believes her own narrative that there is no oil off the SC coast 
111 2018-10-23 23:48:03 Who does the best oil changes, in Reno?

116 2018-10-23 23:47:47 Expecting an UP day today despite international negativity. Our market expected to push back off 5810.
OIL falling and GOLD rising as predicted means increasing NEGATIVE Sentiment world wide.
Unfortunately 5600 is becoming a genuine target in the next 2 weeks (XJO)
117 2018-10-23 23:47:46 ปากดีกันสุดๆไปเลยยย
118 2018-10-23 23:47:44 try the Brussels sprouts.  Bacon, butter, Oliver oil...I could eat a bucket of them
119 2018-10-23 23:47:40 The world needed for crude oil supply adjustment. Those excess surprises are hidden in shale and unrecognised imports.
120 2018-10-23 23:47:37 ไม่อยากออกมาเพราะแบบนี้
121 2018-10-23 23:47:37 Who pays for tariffs? American consumers! Industries getting hurt by the trade war? American farmers, automakers, coal, and oil.

Tariffs drive up the cost of goods, this drives up the cost of living. No worries BILLIONAIRES won't be impacted.

122 2018-10-23 23:47:18 Most Canadians had no idea we import oil, let alone from Saudi. Canadians should be furious at the grand deception/cluelessness of anti pipeline protesters who stole the spotlight and squashed Trans Mountain. Their win is a win for the Saudi regime too.
123 2018-10-23 23:47:13 So I was telling my sister about vaping and my aunt has one that has cbd oil and no thc in it but I hadn’t gotten to the thc part yet and she asks “what’s that stuff called? TLC???”  And I fucking lost it 
124 2018-10-23 23:47:02 My to-do list if I win Mega Millions.
1. Get my oil changed.
2. New underwear.
3. Pay my brother for the season tickets for wrestling. 
4. Put in my two second notice at work. 
5. Take dogs to dog park.
6. Eat Barbecue. 
That's pretty much it....
125 2018-10-23 23:47:00 If you need something quick and easy I usually just do a littttle adobo, pepper, olive oil, garlic or garlic salt, sometimes lemon and it’s basic but still good 
126 2018-10-23 23:46:58 If I win the lottery....

1) I’m gonna start my cattle and oil business
2) Take care of my family 
3) Maybe withdraw from A&M 
4) Buy me a Maserati
127 2018-10-23 23:46:57 PEI is basically doing the same- swapping gas tax for carbon and exempting heating oil... at least until 2020zzz .
128 2018-10-23 23:46:56 AND HOW COME NO ONE TOLD ME ABOUT TRUFFLE OIL?!?!?!?
129 2018-10-23 23:46:47 For the oil change nigga
130 2018-10-23 23:46:34 When logic is your teacher, mind phuckery is not a problem. 
When folk like you allow hollywood and snake oil salesmen to think for you.... you know how that goes.
131 2018-10-23 23:46:20 Y’all females cars prolly be fucked up  shit prolly be overheating. Prolly put No new oil in the car after 3k miles or more smh 
132 2018-10-23 23:46:17 so mag palit nako unya ug caster oil, let's see kung effective ba. 
133 2018-10-23 23:45:53 ...the Millions, School of Fish, New Fast Automatic Daffodils, the Blue Aeroplanes, An Emotional Fish, Jesus Jones, Ned's Atomic Dustbin, Happy Mondays, Midnight Oil... Maria McKee's solo career nipped in the bud...
134 2018-10-23 23:45:51 I'm not buying any oil stocks and likely will refrain from Financial Institutions...
135 2018-10-23 23:45:47 Third culture kid. When you’re raised in another country that your family hasn’t immigrated to essentially. So say your dad works with oil and gas s 5 year contract somewhere so you live there for 5 years before going to his next contract site.
136 2018-10-23 23:45:45 Y’all want some fire Brussel sprouts add olive oil, salt, pepper and Worcestershire sauce.. bacon if you like pork 
137 2018-10-23 23:45:22 How does continuance of USD use for oil transactions favour the UK? I can certainly see why it continues to favour the USA & why the USA will go to war if there are threats to change the currency of transaction but not quite understanding the UK benefits or reasons for buy in
138 2018-10-23 23:44:54 @realDonaldTrump @RachelNotley 
Ok, let’s move the oil to the USA, already building that and then to the ocean and create huge revenue and jobs for both countries
Sound good
139 2018-10-23 23:44:46 Indonesia to auction at least eight exploration blocks this week, making it the third effort to push for higher oil and gas production in the country this year.
140 2018-10-23 23:44:25 Purple oil
141 2018-10-23 23:44:19 It does impact the whole world having a criminal king of a rich oil country who can cause chaos. The world is full of political criminals we don’t need a crazy tyrant kid with oil money. Killing journalists is a redline that all world leader wouldn’t dare get involved in.
142 2018-10-23 23:43:45 Why should anyone take Kapler seriously? Captain Coconut Oil tells us he can win with this team. He is bombastic and positive after games when the team is in freefall for Aug & Sept. Team finishes with holes everywhere.
143 2018-10-23 23:43:43 Answer is yes Eric. That, 9/11 which they funded, and all the other evil they do inside and outside of their country. They only have about 10 to 20 years of oil left anyway.
144 2018-10-23 23:43:39 That's good. For me, I hate the whole hot oil splashing everywhere 
145 2018-10-23 23:43:38 Veo en webcindario pronóstico d Raymond Dalion sobre próxima gran crisis en 2020 Si hay indicios sobre esa nueva gran crisis Conflicto aranceles chino Usa cambio de patrón energético oil para electricidad robotización empobrecimiento d países sin innovación probable guerra global
146 2018-10-23 23:43:17 The UN is in thrall to all that ME oil money. Take a good look at some of the members on the Human Rights and Women's Rights councils.
147 2018-10-23 23:43:03 .@chwfrei concludes - 100% energy access can be achieved by 2030, electricity is the new oil and the green fuels must compliment this transition. It’s a huge opportunity for Australia. #globalmix
148 2018-10-23 23:42:54 Love using Tung Oil. Great finish
149 2018-10-23 23:42:40 He’s a disgusting snake oil salesman who believed in nothing beyond his own ass. Policy be damned.... he’s a despicable human being. Always has been and always will be. And you bought it, hook, line, and sinker. King of the common man? Please.

153 2018-10-23 23:42:21 誰もやらない主人公陣営敗北を描いたと言ってましたけど、誰もやらないのはそれが子ども向けとして面白いのかどうかで見れば面白くないからなんですよねぇ。
そもそも負け陣営と最初からわかってるジオン主役みたいなのではないと、基本的に面白くするの難しいですし
154 2018-10-23 23:42:17 He’s cut 100’s of billions of regulations that stifled business from hiring. He’s opened up oil and gas, Texas now is the number 1 producer in the world. Tax cuts help businesses hire. You may not like his style, but results matter. It’s the economy stupid.
155 2018-10-23 23:42:14 oil lamps are such beautiful imagery, they show you how to breathe in deep, draw oxygen in, and keep the fire burning. Go get you a valoo villahge (op shop, thrift store) oil lamp. Have things around that inspire good in you. May come in handy in the future also.
156 2018-10-23 23:42:09 I guess the we can light a wick in the oil.

158 2018-10-23 23:42:03 I wonder if desert solar thermal in the Middle East plus seawater could provide a liquid synfuel substitute for the region’s oil economy. The infrastructure is already there. Thanks for sharing this.

160 2018-10-23 23:41:53 @realDonaldTrump Potus: The oil (natural resources) underground belongs to every American citizen. When will you stop big oil companies from stealing from the American people. An example is Alaska where every resident get a check.

163 2018-10-23 23:41:50 How can that hurt Iran?  Others will buy their oil.

 why do you intentional ignore his blatant hypocrisy? His bitching about oil caused pollution while he made millions from Saudi owned big oil?
167 2018-10-23 23:41:18 Will always respect @RonDuguay10 but it’s about analytics now and @VallysView talks rings around Doogie. Valiquette analytic eloquence is oil to the more personal approach and water of #10.
168 2018-10-23 23:41:15 Not if you're an attendee at #GHGT14   happening now in Naarm. And not if your the boss man at OPEC or the spokesperson for the IPCC or the sustainabilty pres at BHP. Those 3 are into #CCS and #CCUS all the way. That means more coal, oil and gas.

182 2018-10-23 23:39:40 It’s the other way around actually. What would happen to Saudi Arabia if the world stopped buying their oil. There is plenty coming from other countries, it could be done

186 2018-10-23 23:39:29 Really?  You could try tea tree oil and aloe as well.  My mom used tea tree oil on me as a kid.  It helps with the itching while aloe calms.
187 2018-10-23 23:39:24 아니야ㅠ
188 2018-10-23 23:39:22 We'd seen soldiers and civilians die for worse reasons than keeping a country from developing nuclear weapons. Your alternative to that? I'm sick because we tolerate the Saudi killings so we can burn their polluting oil and fund their nauseating Salafi-Wahhabi-jihadi terrorists.
189 2018-10-23 23:39:20 If I could drink mustard oil out of the bottle, I would. That shit smells strangely good

197 2018-10-23 23:38:25 I would add just a drop of oil - the one problem I had with rice is that it would have a tendency to stick. Just a drop of oil (spread it out with a paper towel) on the pot seems to work fine. IIRC, it takes about 5 minutes on high pressure. Make sure you wash your rice!
198 2018-10-23 23:38:24 Always wondered why any oils were compulsory, but apparently it means the oil has a smell i.e. an essence

204 2018-10-23 23:37:19 What kind of crazy world do we live in where an obviously kind-hearted man can be tortured, then brutally murdered and no one dares to stand up to his assassins because they need the oil that will destroy our planet irreversibly in a mere 12 years?

210 2018-10-23 23:36:38 Justin Trudeau's policies are sending money, business and cheap oil down south to Donald Trump's America, where Canadian investment is up two-thirds while U.S. investment in Canada is down by half. #TrudeauMustGo

212 2018-10-23 23:36:26 Well I certainly hope you're right, although after 39 yrs, there is now a full court press on #Iran govt like never before. #Venezuela, with the worlds largest oil reserves, without a doubt is also a ripe target.
213 2018-10-23 23:36:21 . @CChristineFair Saudi gives $3 billion loan to Pakistan and adittional $3billion USD for oil imports.What are Saudis asking pakistanis in return?

215 2018-10-23 23:35:57 By which he means "hiring accountants to count all the money from the Arms deals and Oil sales".
216 2018-10-23 23:35:50 Get American oil and not a drop from middle east . Our greedy companies fuel barbarism.  It's just so sickly corrupt.  New independent companies can't even grow in energy market . Same people will squeeze you out .So much cash and they bought all US energy companies. Investigate
217 2018-10-23 23:35:50 Where is the evidence that it is environmentalist that are using the arguments against wind or hvdc? Yes, the same argument is being used but it appeared to be oil and gas opponents in the wind catcher case, not greens.

221 2018-10-23 23:35:30 I’m just curious, have you ever used a deck oven?  I’ve taken a bunch of classes at SFBI, you can bake anything in a deck oven. It has tubes filled with oil I believe that circulate below the deck of the oven. There are fans and steam as well, so it’s precise/effective
222 2018-10-23 23:35:24 Nah because mayonnaise is really disgusting!!!! Y’all out here eating raw eggs with oil and vinegar

229 2018-10-23 23:34:53 Okay but how about getting off your butt and doing something about domestic violence?? How about making harsher penalties for murderers and rapists, not those who grow cannabis in the back to make cannabis oil to help their sick friend or family member?? Do something.

243 2018-10-23 23:32:44 Why are we exporting 6.3 million barrels a day and importing 10 millions barrels a day? What ever happened to our oil independence? It goes to the Oil conglomerates. The working consumer in return pays a extra 50 cents a gallon for gas. A Rip-off! #Commodities #Crude #Oil

261 2018-10-23 23:29:58 View from a fellow 1961 born Londoner. Only (almost) competent PM of the 11 that have held office over last 57 years was Harold Wilson. The words competent & Prime Minister are not usually compatible. Thatcher, don’t forget, wasted our oil & gas reserves on dole money. #ToriesOut
262 2018-10-23 23:29:55 Tell that to the 300 Russians Trump obliterated on the battlefield which evidently you know nothing about or you wouldn't make such asinine tweets.

265 2018-10-23 23:29:47 I agree totally. Having a plan is difficult. Taxing is easy. Work with industry to reduce emissions.  Oil sands is trying every day. GM has dual fuel. That’s called having a plan.

274 2018-10-23 23:28:07 If it's so undesirable, why does the US buy all of it (at a discount) and export their own oil?
275 2018-10-23 23:28:02 Please consider not promoting the use of Palm oil. It destroys the habitat of our orang utan friends.
276 2018-10-23 23:27:59 Oil is used to make lots of stuff. #plastic
277 2018-10-23 23:27:54 Maybe they should leave the whales alone. Hope theyclean up the oil damage quietly so they don’t bother the whales. Maybe David Suzuki will help

281 2018-10-23 23:27:46  Dignity and self worth and sex these days is like oil and water. Sex makes every situation whether relationships, friendship etc complicated. Whether you agree or not, dignity and self worth involve ability to separate sex from the equation of life
282 2018-10-23 23:27:30 Day 11 and still no tickets lots of time left 
#ticketsorbust @MapleLeafs
283 2018-10-23 23:27:27 You know what I now realize that I remember the exact moment that might’ve caused this oil leak 
284 2018-10-23 23:27:02 Doesn't your family own car lots where you could get your oil changed for free or in exchange for lunch or babysitting?
285 2018-10-23 23:26:53 I would be surprised if that happens, although after large API build probably some follow through selling. Cheap oil is the Fed's stealth QE so they probably had a hand in today's oil market being hit along with every other market they rigged today.
286 2018-10-23 23:26:11 Agree that shale gas has reduced co2 over last decade in the US, but the research on future impacts is ambiguous. Cheaper gas and cheaper oil will increase aggregate consumption, and this will increase emissions. There’s only so much coal to displace.
287 2018-10-23 23:26:11 First he said he was a marine engineer and then said he couldn't be in the military because his Dad died there,oil engineer etc....
288 2018-10-23 23:26:05 Planning trip back to Washington @realDonaldTrump, got one question Boss: is the simplest reason for friction on climate change  in your opinion because coal gas oil petrochemical stakeholders get grumpy about potential for litigation from carbon pollution attribution?
289 2018-10-23 23:26:01 I thought that was pretty clear they're not Mexicans I know none of you if ever been to Mexico. It is beautiful there. I think the problem is the desert.someone not to drill Wells and find out where there is water instead of oil. No profit in philanthropy.
290 2018-10-23 23:26:00 Yeah i miss that snake oil salesman like a toothache hb
291 2018-10-23 23:25:59 @WWEUsos My heart and prayers are with you and your family during this time. Everything is going to be ok. #RomanReigns #JoeAnoai #AnoaiStrong organic CBD oil has great success too.

299 2018-10-23 23:24:54 Good point. Norway, a country of less than 5m citizens, has a trillion dollar fund and no debt because they encouraged the oil industry and forced it to be sold at global prices. Leadership. Did Canada follow suit? No. Why do you think the world will follow carbon taxes?
300 2018-10-23 23:24:22 何かスポーツでもやってるんです？
301 2018-10-23 23:24:08 But the British armed Ibn posthumously, and then oil was discovered...and now a grandson of Ibn is causing real trouble because King Salman broke the old succesion rule. There will be very serious, internal issues over all of this. Watch out for Talal.
302 2018-10-23 23:24:02 Stock takin brutal hits this week my Twitter, Cannabis and oil stock losing right now. I’m hold on to them for awhile.

Time to oil up the ol cocker spaniel!

307 2018-10-23 23:23:19 Well, we are all citizens of Saskatchewan and Canada. My point is, as an oil company advisor, I would say he definitely has a dog in the fight and his opinion may be skewed.
308 2018-10-23 23:23:19 We lived it three recessions on his watch he must be peddling his snake oil to products of our indoctrination grads
309 2018-10-23 23:23:09 Interesting how they don't mention any CBD and they talk about cigarettes in the abstract whereas the news talks about thc/cbd oil...
310 2018-10-23 23:22:55 Wait-don't be such a naive liberal fool.I said I didn't give a shit about YOUR country's politics,because who ever runs your country will still follow America's lead.Yeah we care about the Mid-East because they've got Oil.We don't need their love,just their oil and cooperation.
311 2018-10-23 23:22:51 Data is the oil of the 21st century. But oil is just useless thick goop until you refine it into fuel.
312 2018-10-23 23:22:50 Scent memory is such a powerful thing - tonight I poured a tablespoon of sesame oil over some ground pork with onions and peppers that I was frying and I was instantly transported somewhere else (probably Chinatown.)
313 2018-10-23 23:22:45 “Oh my goddddd you smoke weed? Weed is so bad!”
Dude, it’s 2018 everyone and their dog smokes weed. My damn dog takes cbd oil. stfu and get off your moral high horse. weed isn’t bad
314 2018-10-23 23:22:33 気が向いたときにはココナツオイル (Dabur Vatika Enriched Coconut Hair Oil 150ml) 混ぜてますが、基本は水で溶くだけです。ココナツオイルは夏以外は室温で固まるのでお湯で温めます。
315 2018-10-23 23:22:24 OK, let's break it down. SA sells 3% of its oil to the US, and 9.6% to China. However that 3% is 11% of US oil imports. The US wants to impose sanctions; China doesn't. So the US loses 11% of its oil imports, while China goes "LOL, gg" and carries on like nothing had happened.
316 2018-10-23 23:22:17 Finally,,,, I’m getting cbd oil
317 2018-10-23 23:22:14 I’ll go there to change my oil and brakes soon 
318 2018-10-23 23:22:08 Aussie market off to a flat start after 3 straight days of falls. #ASX 200 up just 2pts to 5846. No surprise energy stocks are slumping following a 4% tumble in oil overnight. Gains from major banks helping #ausbiz
319 2018-10-23 23:22:05 We are getting oil on deferred payment and not cash is what I'm hearing
320 2018-10-23 23:22:02 What a wretched hive of villainy, & -because Big Oil owns the US government- we've been backing these barbarians since WWII.

The US has been fighting the wrong people in the Middle East for a long time. Unlike Iraq or Afghanistan, this is a war that could be over in seconds.
321 2018-10-23 23:21:50 Bhai, money market may FOREX rate ki terha spot rate, future rates are calculated with a certain cushion. We need to know whether AU & Dawood have the expertise? Oil deals are not everyone's cuppa tea. I hope they don't make mistakes like Dar did.
322 2018-10-23 23:21:41 New Pakistan.  Under the leadership of IK will prosperous and will astonish the world by the grace of Allah in all good ways.

324 2018-10-23 23:21:36 I need some castor oil
325 2018-10-23 23:21:32 It’s oil from the homeland. It’s all good.
326 2018-10-23 23:21:20 BP, Conoco, Valero do not get their oil from there!!!!!!!!!
327 2018-10-23 23:21:10 Millikan's oil drop experiments and other examples of "n=tedious" experiments, perhaps?
328 2018-10-23 23:21:01 Only need to look at oil production documentaries of what goes on in underdeveloped countries to conclude the best thing we can do is build a pipeline, and stop importing. The environmental damage in other countries is mind boggling.
329 2018-10-23 23:20:54 Keep drinking the koolaid and smearing the snake  oil all over their body. It’s mind boggling the trance Traitor in Chief can put them in. Yikes, Houston we have a disaster.
330 2018-10-23 23:20:42 girl KNOCKED. i took a bath and soaked in lavender oil and bro we KO’d. we for sure can come over this weekend or sumn.
331 2018-10-23 23:20:27 So easy to give advice from the cheap seats.  Why don't you lead a boycott of Saudi Oil or encourage electric cars?
332 2018-10-23 23:20:19 i just threw mad castor oil on my mustache if this don’t grow by tomorrow i’m shaving my beard
333 2018-10-23 23:20:18 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
334 2018-10-23 23:20:00 @CalRipeOlives I've been looking for the garlic infused oil and can't find it apart from sellers on Amazon asking $50 or more. Any chance you'll be bringing it back?
335 2018-10-23 23:19:58 It is a bit shit that one journalist gets killed by Saudi and the world takes notice, but women get hugely oppressed, foreign workers are forced into indentured slavery, and they starve Yemen and no one gives a shit. Money and oil talk.
336 2018-10-23 23:19:51 Haha @ “Tell them” .... I’m getting a “mysterious yearly mineral rights” check from an oil company that just covers my needs and trips to Jupiter.
337 2018-10-23 23:19:43 2/2 our culture, beliefs, and way of life destroyed by white colonialism.Our water has been poisoned with oil &/or radiation. All we want to do is vote and make a better life for our families.  Our hearts break and we are dying for the white man
338 2018-10-23 23:19:24 This is great news! Glad that I can start using Dove again. Looking forward to your future changes regarding palm oil. :)

347 2018-10-23 23:18:31 Imagine if we used all the trillions of dollars to invade Iraq for oil and used it to get off oil, by creating electric cars and renewable energy sources. Now we're just going to be stuck with a whole bunch of depreciating barrels of muck laying around. #nowars #futureisrenewable
348 2018-10-23 23:18:14 Americans seeking human decency over oil rights? You have to be kidding!
349 2018-10-23 23:18:09 Roman Maroni would call them fargin cork suckers....and he'd be right. I hope all of their oil settled on the flesh of their children and burns...slowly.
350 2018-10-23 23:17:56 Oil deals would always stand at the rate of the time. So yes, your concern is valid.
In sha Allah, harsh time will fade off soon.
351 2018-10-23 23:17:52 Medical experts say you can flush out the DDT by oil pulling.
352 2018-10-23 23:17:42 use this ointment it’s called “clindacin” on areas where u have a lot of acne and use Vitamin E oil from body shop before u go to sleep UR SKIN WILL KISS UR FEET and use face masks for deep cleaning or if ur skin is too dry use the vitamin e mask from body shop so good 100%
353 2018-10-23 23:17:26 There are 232,000 employees in oil&gas in CO and 5,500,000 total residents.  96% of us should vote yes on prop 112. #prop112
354 2018-10-23 23:16:56 Well shit

356 2018-10-23 23:16:37 @HomeDepotCanada @LeighAnnAllaire @RustOleumCA #We_Wood  I also sealed our livingroom floor but put back the water based stain on the advice of the associate and bought Oil based - ruined my grey stained floor!  I cry every day when I see the yellow spots on my work of art
357 2018-10-23 23:16:25 @realDonaldTrump Just like to exempt China or India from the sanctions on oil, you will see the devastating anger that has not happened before. This great difference can be a deadly blow to you in the elections, I hope it will not work
358 2018-10-23 23:16:22 Fine but why did you vote for the bill that open up our reserves to oil drilling.  How is that being proactive on climate.  What substantive change has the Climate Caucus passed or even proposed?
359 2018-10-23 23:16:20 It works the way the oil companies want it to!  Inefficiently.
360 2018-10-23 23:16:19 What about the Texas, Arizonan, Nevadan construction or oil field workers slogging through the heat at work each day!   Hmmmmm what about them?  Do you have a story about the producers in the country slogging through the heat each day?   Hmmmmm Not!

363 2018-10-23 23:16:06 No we should invade Mexico. If they can’t stop 5,000 unarmed peeps on their border then it’ll be over in 3 weeks.  We get rid of the cartels and build the wall on the Mexican border using Mexican oil money. YES.
364 2018-10-23 23:16:01 thanks! it looks like a new one underneath, er aside from the oil leak :)
365 2018-10-23 23:15:52 Gotcha. May be an ag twitter abomination but I don’t know mechanical terms like “twin screw drive.” I have a mechanic on speed dial and many times have to watch you tube to perform simple mechanical tasks. Most of the time I can change oil though lol
366 2018-10-23 23:15:52 Let’s face it: peddling snake oil was always a money making shtick. There’s one born every minute
367 2018-10-23 23:15:42 @realDonaldTrump 
Mr President, our nation produces the most oil in the world today.  Yet our nations gas prices hover around $3 per gallon, this is INSANE.  Please sign a executive order banning ALL oil sales from all USA oil companies to foreign countries.  Put America 1st!!!
368 2018-10-23 23:15:39 Trudeau wanted to restore  eastern economic dominance over all of Canada. To do so, he had to destroy Canada's economic engine and kick Alberta when oil prices were down. He only cares about the ON and PQ vote.
369 2018-10-23 23:15:36 OMG I need some CBD oil we are near thebHoover Dam. It is high up, my ears are popping and I'm terrified of heights! Kevin keeps telling me to look And I jus wanna puke! Jere are a few pics I got before we got too high up.

372 2018-10-23 23:15:27  yeah I almost passed out at work from the pain but I’m definitely a lot better. Ate a nice salad with lots of iron, chugged four water bottles, and, oh yEAH, LATHERED MYSELF WITH PEPPERMINT OIL LOL
373 2018-10-23 23:15:26 Never like his commercials as he sounds like snake oil salesman.....that’s likely why as Trump is the best lying snake oil guy!?
374 2018-10-23 23:15:04 Let me just get this straight. Plastic comes from oil. Plastic can, therefore, be burnt in incinerator plants that have strict control over emissions. Why do we have a problem?
375 2018-10-23 23:14:41 Little Dubai and little princesses. Badawah mentality doesn’t cure with oil money.
376 2018-10-23 23:14:39 I thought I missed weave but I actually can't wait to get a hot oil treatment & a doobie
377 2018-10-23 23:14:36 It’s not alarmist. The risks are real and serious. There are literal cases of cancer due to the oil well on the property. The part of the subway that would go under BHHS will begin construction this summer & the federal gov’t can pull funding at any moment. It is not done.
378 2018-10-23 23:14:36 OK 
Need to know the details of oil deals. Rate kya fix hua? Usually  Oil prices will average $74/b in 2018 and $75/b in 2019. Prices are rising because OPEC cut supply. By 2030, the expected price would be $93 a barrel. We need to see the impact on our economy.
379 2018-10-23 23:14:33 RT @sidnotsorry: females get a car and don't check the oil, tire pressure, or coolant. As long as a MF start up and radio work she ready to roll 
380 2018-10-23 23:14:31 well if it was drowning in sauce it would of been saucy but that shit was all oil no flavor or anything 
381 2018-10-23 23:14:19 Now is the time to start asking people if they voted when you're in the checkout line ask the person behind the cashier when you go get your oil change ask the mechanics ask the other customers while you're waiting every chance you get you need to ask people if they voted
382 2018-10-23 23:14:11 Fmm... we need oil or lotion.
383 2018-10-23 23:14:05 Orange is the new Red...Trump is not a Republican!  He’s a two bit snake oil salesmen perpetrating a con the the American people...vote Blue and put a stop to the raping of our values and liberties!
384 2018-10-23 23:14:02 “eating dinner” apparently only means one of two things to my brain: slowcooked butter braised salmon with a brown sugar reduction and olive oil asparagus OR snarfing a whole jar of pickles over the sink w a fork
385 2018-10-23 23:13:59 Most salt sensitivity can be fixed by
1.) increasing K/Mg intake 
2.) improving insulin resistance
3.) fixing elevated aldosterone or cortisol
4.) fish oil 
5.) glycine
386 2018-10-23 23:13:53 Olive oil is much more expensive!
387 2018-10-23 23:13:51 hint going vegan has made my skin clear up soo much. I would get acne on my right chin before my . every month but not anymore. Vegan since Aug '17. GOOD diet=good skin. Aloe and coconut water too. Cetaphil face wash (dab tea tree oil on acne) .

393 2018-10-23 23:13:00 @TheDemocrats : Yeah dangerous for Trump to want us to be safe in our own country, prosperity, jobs, manufacturing back, more oil production, secure borders, sovereignty respected,, higher wages, lower middle class taxes. new medical insurance plans, legal immigration - dangerous
394 2018-10-23 23:12:57 China has cut off US Oil - 1/3 of the US Oil export market and losing 1  billion per month and you can't sell it anywhere else because no one  trusts the US to uphold trade deals and Russia sells it cheaper. It's  like Trump was working for Russia....

404 2018-10-23 23:10:53 I’m part of an angel investment network and I get email alerts on agri based investments and the one sector which continually comes up is hemp farming and CBD oil. There seems to be a lot of people investing a lot of money in it
405 2018-10-23 23:10:47 Varoyi express

Please be at your designated pickup points when the rusero comes.

Please no clothes allowed on the rusero and bring your passport as we will be crossing over to Mozambique for cooking oil shopping spree
406 2018-10-23 23:10:45 Isn't it amazing? Hahahaahah. Good morning po. The fish will swim away from the oil. Baka ma fried fish din ako.
407 2018-10-23 23:10:32 What are your thoughts on CBD Oil?
408 2018-10-23 23:10:26 I have been against our cooperation with the Saudis since before 9/11. All about weapons and oil and this country should be ashamed. Trump has NO contract for weapons, just mutual understandings that Saudis often do not fulfill and supposed promises to Jared that they break.

Pasta (with coconut oil), steamed butternut squash, fresh cranberries and grapes.  .... we had a quiet morning =)
416 2018-10-23 23:09:39 The world’s most valuable resource is no longer oil but data. #SAS
417 2018-10-23 23:09:39 But we don’t set the price if they take their oil off the market the price goes to 100 plus and the wheels come off
418 2018-10-23 23:09:37 It was like watching a sequel of betrayal - even though you made it first! *Sighs again; starts jumping from thought to thought in my head* Wait! Go back to the oil exhibit, I'm confused? Do they just have a small path, with a wall to contain the oil?
419 2018-10-23 23:09:36 Just tried to plump my lips with cayenne pepper & coconut oil, the results are underwhelming.
420 2018-10-23 23:09:32 Snake oil salesman. Would sell people turpentine as a cure for a runny nose! And the kicker is some people will buy it!!!
421 2018-10-23 23:09:30 The beauty of central control and planning (socialism) is that it can ruin the parts it touches while leaving other parts functioning. I don't know about the %'s but Maduro has socilized enough to create decreasing oil production and mass starvation.

424 2018-10-23 23:09:06 Those guys can get away with anything. We have to let them. 
If we don't, the barrel of oil will shoot to 800 bucks. We only have ourselves to blame.
We got us here.

427 2018-10-23 23:08:38 I agree that the website should be more straightforward, but TCO is something very different with an EV that with an ICE (see oil, brakes, fuel, etc.). Nobody is educating the public on EVs and Tesla has the right to say something about it: we agree it should be less aggressive.
428 2018-10-23 23:08:34 Nigeria is still there searching for Oil.
429 2018-10-23 23:08:33 Remember when I said columbus bread is sex in your mouth? Add Pastabilities spicy hot tomato oil to bread and you got a full on orgy taking over your mouth
430 2018-10-23 23:08:19 You keep that shit sir, I’m full of Fish Oil, sorry!
431 2018-10-23 23:08:15 And I remember you saying (when my buddy Barack was in office)
" we have our own oil"  we don't need theirs!!!
432 2018-10-23 23:08:10 no not stuck with them we just lack the needed leadership to destroy them once and for all as we should have done in 1973 when they quadrupled the oil price ?
433 2018-10-23 23:08:09 directly pouring olive oil on my hands because I'm out of lotion
434 2018-10-23 23:08:00 Sorry. Just noticed it says oil which is different.

Diet sleep and exercise

438 2018-10-23 23:07:37 So how will get yourself to work everyday or on your vacation before alternative energy sources are fully developed and available? Think it through. We will all still need to use oil WHILE we develop new energy sources. Which is what we must do...
439 2018-10-23 23:07:22 In this case...this horde is being financed by Venezuela, very probably using China's money. To keep it looking legit, China probably just contracted to buy a shitload of Venezuela's oil. IF they can get it refined. They're having a little problem with that.
440 2018-10-23 23:07:18 Bevo, the trouble is the world has been letting the Saudis get away with mureder for years. Because of our fear of no oil. This bloke the Clown Prince needs to be meted out death in the same way as Kashoggi. Cruel and painful. I'm sure he travels. 
441 2018-10-23 23:07:16 Lying Donny trump at it again he’s full throat and it’s up to us to spread the word that he’s full of crap don’t be fooled by his bullshit he’s nothing but a snake oil salesmen

**Unabridged history of the pumpkin**

Put seeds on cookie sheet with oil and salt. Bake at 300 degrees until golden brown.
444 2018-10-23 23:07:00 I should oil my motorcycle... #MinkBot
445 2018-10-23 23:06:52 Saudis BEEN ruining relationships. (9/11)! We just never held them accountable bc we have been dependent on their oil. This could change now that we no longer have to depend on them for that. #voteRED 
446 2018-10-23 23:06:46 Exactly, but we survived and stand on the right side of history.
Which is worth far more than Saudi oil.
447 2018-10-23 23:06:41 This is the price of doing business. Trudeau gave money to Bombardier, so his dad did. Auto workers pay back in high taxes. Every auto job = 5 support jobs. Do the math. If Saudi deal is so bad why Trudeau doesn’t invest in our own oil?
448 2018-10-23 23:06:28 What’s cbd oil?
449 2018-10-23 23:06:18 oh and save all the sausage drippings from the saute , pour it over the chicken peppers onion and potato  drizzle some extra virgin olive oil , toss with the usual Italian suspect herbs + salt pepper and roast skin side up for an hour at 450 , score the thighs 
450 2018-10-23 23:06:16 I literally love pissing my manager off. She fucking fills these spray bottles at work with alcohol and peppermint oil(which corrodes plastic) that shit don't make good room spray!! Fill that bitch with lavender or something!  Lol but she goes can you stop dumping them out, you..
451 2018-10-23 23:06:03 Mostly it's because the Saudis has oil to barter with. Nations run like the mob. If you have something to offer the UN and other countries will look away, "protection money" basically. 
Anyone who can't pay, gets bad press. 
UN is useless anyway.
452 2018-10-23 23:06:02 But... Trump wants lower oil prices, no?  Tough to have it both ways.
453 2018-10-23 23:06:00 The West should revoke  the visas of all Saudi college students. The Crown Prince can threaten the oil or Russian card. We can buy  from Iran. The Saudi  have money and oil. Do they really want to park it in Russia & China? The Crown Prince must step down, peacefully or
454 2018-10-23 23:05:53 Just your average day on Twitter spreading knowledge to the young Twitter Gays that using coconut oil instead of expensive lube for sex is a better bang (pun fully intended) for your buck. Nothing to see here.

We will be glad if you can help us sir
God bless as u do
456 2018-10-23 23:05:40 That does not mean I believe things will revert back to the way they were. If say Tesla and Musk, Bezos and Netflix create a world of mobility which revolutionizes transportation, supply chain manufacturing, distribution, upends the petrodollar, oil, service economy
457 2018-10-23 23:05:38 @IrishRail Tell the lad going east on the n25coming out of cork city to stop firing lighting fags out the window when an oil lorry is behind
458 2018-10-23 23:05:33 I see I see. I'm burning midnight oil at work. Running towards the light at the end of a looooong tunnel.
459 2018-10-23 23:05:20 And what if the oil price goes up (which it will) bad for us.

462 2018-10-23 23:05:08 $3 billion deffered oil payment for 3 years.
Each year will be $3 billion. So total $9 billion from oil side. And the remaining $3 billion will be parked in SBP to boost forex reserve.

464 2018-10-23 23:04:53 MCT oil is awesome. Respect it. Because if you take it for granted and have too much you will shit your own pants...there is such a thing as too much of a good thing.
465 2018-10-23 23:04:30 Not to be a Trump apologist, but it’s entirely possible he labeled himself a “nationalist” with no clue as to what that word means or it’s historical implications. Never underestimate what a moron he is. He’s got the cunning of a snake oil salesman, sure, but that ain’t smarts.

471 2018-10-23 23:04:08 And you would do what? Oil was down 5% today as the Saudis said they will pump more it’s like pay rack
472 2018-10-23 23:04:05 Wow. They did something right.
And how about not poisoning them with oil.
473 2018-10-23 23:04:04 Just got my green, red and purple today! Boxes crushed on green and red from too much packing material. Still rad though! Has anyone noticed how greasy they are after opening them? There was also an oil stain or something on the corner of the box. What is this mysterious liquid?
474 2018-10-23 23:03:57 There is def a pending alien attack on planet Earth... Gonna need lots of oil for those rocket ships (I feel like Ross Gerber with the narrative)
475 2018-10-23 23:03:51 Add Turmeric to everything. Turmeric with honey 2 to 3 times a day...in milk or lemon water.  Also oregano oil will help with flu and colds.
476 2018-10-23 23:03:46 You’ll have to let the big oil companies know that we’re counting them among fledgling businesses.

485 2018-10-23 23:02:37 Notice how oil sold off with the market early 2018....
486 2018-10-23 23:02:37 Is Saudi Arabia run by the CIA. That looked like an Agency hit. The way the cover up has taken place is unbelievable. They are not a strategic Ally. The US is sold out to the Oil money of this Regime a Regime that charges kids because they are protesting their brutally within.

490 2018-10-23 23:02:20 He's undertaken to reinstate oil & gas exploration permits and abolish the Regional fuel tax for starters.
491 2018-10-23 23:02:13 Sorry but try mixing red oil and maggi with Cameroon pepper
492 2018-10-23 23:02:13 He will pick his son and his country over the US. He controls the oil.
493 2018-10-23 23:02:04 and what about the tax cut for billionaires... and by the way..  the "Beto" vote for tax on the barrels of oil, was for export.. Do you know what export means? those buying oil would pay more for it, giving money to Texas.. Why do you twist the truth? WTF is wrong with this man?
494 2018-10-23 23:01:52 They are the ones with three different varieties - nine mini pies in total.  One of them had almonds on top. I know that you use 'sustainable' palm oil, but I try to steer clear of any palm oil as some suppliers have been caught passing off non sustainable oil as sustainable.
495 2018-10-23 23:01:42 A train run off oil 
496 2018-10-23 23:01:10 Just leave the contract as is. The Saudi's may cancel it themselves anyway if you scold them too much. They are kind of easy to offend. Or is it just an excuse because Canada has oil?
497 2018-10-23 23:00:59 y’all this funniest shit happened at oil spill 
498 2018-10-23 23:00:55 You just told Ontarians who voted 3 months ago that they are stupid and worthless and you know better. Goodbye federal Liberals. Meanwhile you accept Saudi oil into Canada and sell them equipment. Totally immoral and corrupt. You need to go yesterday.

513 2018-10-23 23:00:02 People are waking up to this, the $15ish added to oil prices for the Iran sanctions will likely have to come off now, as EM is slowing and Saudis have to go balls to the walls after their "mishaps".  Perhaps maybe an extra 15 off the other way, on a consequent demand slowdown?
514 2018-10-23 23:00:00 Elkay am an oil & gas operations expert not an economist but from my High School economics, Inflation happens when aggregate demand is grows faster than aggregate supply. I don’t see this happening with a paltry less than $300/month minimum wage I propose.
515 2018-10-23 22:59:52 @JustinTrudeau how about putting Energy East back on the table and taking Saudi oil off the table?  Kind of makes sense to stop importing from a nation that believes killing innocent journalists is a good solution, don’t you think?  #JamalKhashoggi #growaset

521 2018-10-23 22:58:33 Are brands made in US unadulterated due to FDA/USDA labeling requirements? Or is there some obscure law that allows oil to read “olive oil” when it isn’t? Or do US brands lie? I can’t afford $70 for daily use. I’ll have to use pig fat

527 2018-10-23 22:57:35 Yes, I find extract oil is way overpriced. So I vape most of the time. None of it is cheap, but it works for me. I hope you find relief, good luck.

533 2018-10-23 22:56:50 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
Coconut oil won’t give you a tingly or heat sensation or whatever the fuck else lube does but it’s relatively cheap and lasts forever (especially if you don’t have sex a lot like me ) and doesn’t leak.
534 2018-10-23 22:56:35 Is it $12bn??? 
I thought $3bn loan 
$3bn oil on deferred payment.
535 2018-10-23 22:56:20 In other words, #ElusiveElise would rather Tax working people for going to work than tax Corporate Polluters.

539 2018-10-23 22:55:43 So you allow Saudi oil into the country, allow the death of Enrgy East and NG and TMX, then over ride an election in Ontario to tax us and then return our own money to buy votes  .. we will not forget this corruption. Hopefully Canadians can think and figure out what is going on
540 2018-10-23 22:55:37 We sell #weapons to terrorist countries that don't value human life just so we can keep our #economy up. Seems a bit crazy doesn't it. Every president does it from all parties. We don't have a government that cares for us, just a puppet show to distract us. #oil #guns #terrorism
541 2018-10-23 22:55:02 I'm putting up signs for Katie Arrington to stop Democrat Joe Cunningham. Joe is making an issue on drilling for oil on South Carolina coast. We have shallow water 50 miles out. tapping American energy doesn't mean oil on beaches. Fake news
542 2018-10-23 22:55:01 Well Diane. Why don't we break diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia. Declare them a hostile nation.Then the Saudis jack the price if a barrel of oil to $300. A gallon of gas in Calif. will cost $9.00. All for some Arab journalist who did something very wrong. Find a motive!
543 2018-10-23 22:54:48 @chigrl

547 2018-10-23 22:54:38 What happened to the Honduran Lower Aguán Valley, local farmers whose land was illegally taken over by a the owner(s) of large-scale cultivation of palm oil.  Were the farmers able to keep their land?  Who was the palm oil owner?  One reason for Caravan.
548 2018-10-23 22:54:36 Not an actual thing. Oil & water, baby 
549 2018-10-23 22:54:28 He and his siblings sold off Papa Trump’s estate in 2004. I suspect that Russian mob money starting pouring in shortly thereafter. Especially given the rising price of oil in the mid-2000s.
550 2018-10-23 22:54:22 These broken promises?

* Added more than 400,000 manufacturing jobs.
* 100,000 new jobs supporting the production & transport of oil & natural gas.

552 2018-10-23 22:54:20 Thank you for siding with the truth on Cannabis.

Also. If he hasn't already...Ed should consider adding CBD oil like CWHemp to his MMJ doses. It will increase the pain relief effect w/out increasing the 'high'. Which is helpful esp. for daytime.

2. Leak info to both Saudi & Turkey about #Khashoggi - Done
3. Encourage Erdogan(bad cop) to go after Saudi to showoff -Done
4. Pressure MbS for lower Oil $ & new arms deal - In Progress
554 2018-10-23 22:54:11 Liar. You know that Russia currently has socialized medicine along with many European nations and Canada. You prefer socializing the oil industry with huge subsidies and tax breaks. Socialized medicine helps the average guy, socialized subsidies for business help the rich.
555 2018-10-23 22:54:09 geranium oil is so beautiful and good

its anti-inflammatory, antidepressant, anti-anxiety, and the scent promotes a positive mood

its just such a good little water element buddy and it smells so nice i always spiral a few drops through my bath
556 2018-10-23 22:54:03 If that's the actual cost of fuel for cars so be it. That's called economics. More people will get out of the gas guzzlers or swap them for electric vehicles once gas is no longer subsidised by the State. Why are we subsidising oil company profits in the first place?
557 2018-10-23 22:53:57 Means that those who told us continually 12 months ago that oil would not be going to $70 anytime soon were wrong.

566 2018-10-23 22:52:51 Yay, I'm glad! :) It totally doesn't work like that with the oil, the sedating effect is definitely more emotional in my experience. Nothing intensifies or turns surreal. My anxiety is incredible on it and I can still go about my day!

575 2018-10-23 22:51:54 @PnPCBC pipeline east is already in existence except for  a piece to go through Quebec to New Brunswick. So it would make common  sense that we would use our own oil instead of  foreign oil. the problem is that common sense seems hard to come by these days in this current govt

588 2018-10-23 22:50:30 Oil tax revenues return this year for the first time in 3 years due to the rise in oil price and cutting costs and wages. £1 billion revenue predicted. Down £19 billion form the highs of 2012. Nowhere near enough to support an independent Scotland.

593 2018-10-23 22:50:01 I was trying to look up how to add salt to fried rice effectively. Was thinking maybe mixing with oil beforehand, but I think I'll just use more soysauce
594 2018-10-23 22:49:41 It really will, won't it? All those oil reserves suddenly become worthless. They've got the space and finances, at the moment, for massive solar farms. Is that viable, though? Anywhere on the equator could host those.
595 2018-10-23 22:49:35 Lol okay. We make oil pipelines, why not a water pipeline. What can the hippies protest then? A water spill? To build it would be a major job creator. It isn’t only for pple to drink. CA and the rest of the SW produces the vast majority of our produce. We need water to feed you.

602 2018-10-23 22:49:02 Well, 1st pipelines are safer than transport by rail and truck. Second, you need $$ and oil to develop cleaner energy and products. So the main thing pipelines help are to get our oil to market at a competitive price, giving us the money we need to develop and the oil to produce
603 2018-10-23 22:48:57 #SaudiArabia is engaged in a genocidal war that has devastated Libya, Yemen & Syria. #JamalKhashoggi was a staunch supporter of jihadists in Syria & faced the same fate as planned by the nasty boy #MBS but Western powers close their eyes on all this because they need their oil.

670 2018-10-23 22:40:24 The GOP loves socialism as long as it’s in the form of subsidies for corporate interests like big oil or tanks/planes the military never asked for. Fire/ Police departments, FEMA, public schools, Medicare/Social Security, the CDC, National Parks, and prisons are all socialism.

679 2018-10-23 22:39:05 How can cannabis help chronic pain from multiple spinal compression fractures?  I can't tell that CBD oil does anything for me, but don't like the way the oil containing THC makes me feel (dizzy, disoriented, stumbling).
680 2018-10-23 22:39:00 What he blames is not to blame! No lie drumpf, as he can't blame his bribing big oil about being the biggest reason and it is burning fossil fuel and big oil are responsible for their non-existing bullshit lies of are global warming, of this no ploy that he should he have said??
681 2018-10-23 22:38:59 Just use coconut oil. It works for everything.
682 2018-10-23 22:38:58 So imagine the danger when the US embargoes Iranian oil, Iran attempts to block the Strait of Hormuz in retaliation, or Iran’s allies in Yemen fire missiles at Saudi #tankers in the Red Sea, as has happened recently. The US #naval base in Bahrain could also be a target. @guardian
683 2018-10-23 22:38:45 Can't say nothing slick to a can of oil
684 2018-10-23 22:38:36 We will be ok
Just keep plodding along
Oil fell to 66 a barrel down 4℅
So that is great for motorists when they decide to lower petrol
685 2018-10-23 22:38:36 Who is “we”?? Not the government. Oh. It’s Irving Oil. Yell at them!!

687 2018-10-23 22:38:17 It's been obvious comparing with #Saudi, #Iran's been far more democratic. U.S. has been claimed herself as a guardian of #democracy but now it's clear the police's been completely bribed by oil money.
688 2018-10-23 22:38:12 lol, take a friggin history lesson. Decades ago the feds wanted to make  everyone in Canada use Canadian oil. They were going to build refineries  and pipelines etc.
Do you know who blocked it? Alberta and the PC party.
They got what they wanted.
689 2018-10-23 22:38:01 Cooking oil mukutii nayo
690 2018-10-23 22:37:38 Because the people in power like you, still have their heads buried in the Tarsands. Or #LNG. Old, outdated thinking. In some cases, they have been bought by oil lobbyists. Have you read Kevin Taft “Oills Deep State”?  It clearly documents the sale of our democracy to big oil.
691 2018-10-23 22:37:27 Since @Storm_Nation ignored my request for help. I'll ask @MotivBowling. I am need of a new bowling ball (a ball that can handle medium-heavy oil patterns). Care to help a man out? 
692 2018-10-23 22:37:21 Just found this bomb beard and body oil for men. I’m buying this for my dad.

697 2018-10-23 22:36:35 In all honesty, how does Buhari's economic policies affect Nigerian growth negatively?
How does his economic policies cause poverty in Nigeria? 
Can somebody answer this in all honesty looking back at where we came from vis a vis fluctuations in oil prices & our foreign reserve?
698 2018-10-23 22:36:20 Painters of my twitter.  I have come across an issue that google isn't able to solve.  I went to apply a wash/glaze over my finished albino lady and the wash pebbled up like water on waterproof paper.  I was/am using linseed oil and paint thinner to create the wash
699 2018-10-23 22:36:16 Very interesting John, I won’t ditch oil seed rape yet but one or two more years like this for flea beetle damage and if the government take any more plant protection tools out of our tool box by banning safe products then it could be more than oil seed rape that we stop growing.
700 2018-10-23 22:36:14 Using Newfoundland oil would be better.
701 2018-10-23 22:36:09 Lmao tell me how my neighbor forgot about a pot full of oil on the stove and caught it on fire, our whole apartment building almost burned down
702 2018-10-23 22:36:08 Called to get my car’s oil changed and right after I said hey this is Karen Whitney the guy goes please tell me you’re not still driving that Honda civic

You got what your parents wanted.
710 2018-10-23 22:35:10 Well, of course for the oil! Oh, not a big oil producer are they.
711 2018-10-23 22:35:06 I have holy oil from Jerusalem so trust me
712 2018-10-23 22:35:03 @notaxation is crunch really that bad? After all they are choosing 2 work there. I put in well over 60 hours a week between school & work. & 4 1 summer I legitimately worked 100 hr weeks in the oil field. Ultimately crunch is necessary given the nature of the creative process imo
713 2018-10-23 22:35:01 Oil was down 5% after Saudi Arabia pledged to increase output, whilst Copper retreated and iron ore marched higher. US 10yr bonds were in demand, pushing #yields down to 3.11% before they clawed back to 3.17%. Gold was slightly higher, along with the #Yen.

715 2018-10-23 22:34:36 Yeah he's done plenty. He's getting coffee for trump ex cream ex sugar. Takes out the trash. Whispers in trumps ear that he's the greatest while rubbing oil on his back. That's Pency poo of course he's done something. Hell I heard he cleans trumps gold toilet with baby wipes.

726 2018-10-23 22:33:16 I have used coconut oil by itself and it didn’t do anything but coat it for like 30 minutes. But I’m not gonna hate on coconut oil she’s good for literally so many other things.
727 2018-10-23 22:33:04 Those poor souls working in an awesome office, making something truly incredible. Try “crunching” on an oil rig.
728 2018-10-23 22:32:56 I just got an oil change why do I have no oil 
729 2018-10-23 22:32:50 America needs to sanction one of her biggest investors in Saudi Arabia over the Jamal Khashoggi's death very soon, let us see what it spells out for an oil producing nation like OUR Nigeria.
730 2018-10-23 22:32:29 Blood money (oil).
731 2018-10-23 22:32:27 So your story is that you take issue with the Washington Post's characterization of a 14 year old oil leak in the gulf? Thanks for focusing on the important stuff. #fakenews
732 2018-10-23 22:32:26 Let us remember that the range of oil prices when Brent was at $85 was between $38 and $87, with many producers in the Permian getting only $50/b for what people are getting $85 in the international market.  So let us not kid ourselves about prices.
733 2018-10-23 22:32:15 Trump says Saudis staged 'worst cover up ever' on Khashoggi==  These lying ass people hate the US !!! This relationship is ALL ABOUT OIL!!!

746 2018-10-23 22:30:43 Supply management was done when oil was in 40s. Since then it's just been Iran and Venezuela, which to an extent are uncontrollable. So if it goes up from 42 to almost 87, and comes down to 75, it's not busy of a bubble which was artificially inflated. It went up for a reason 1/2

751 2018-10-23 22:30:07 Thank you for your reply.  Your explanation helps and doesn't.   I just do not like palm oil.  Won't buy products with it.  Further, won't buy stock in companies who use it.  Appreciate the info though.  Thx.

756 2018-10-23 22:29:57 The first one was to takeover the Ottoman Empire and gain access to Middle Eastern oil. The second was British arrogance, Hitler admired the British empire and wanted to preserve it. A war with China will be unpopular/suicidal, so the U.S/Israeli/Sud elites’ll rather invade Iran.
757 2018-10-23 22:29:53 If you think about it beards are basically make up for men...

758 2018-10-23 22:29:45 We will pay for it sooner or later through another round of subsidies to oil, through increased healthcare costs (if some of the elderly live that long because of the pollution) or loss or damage of property. But it may happen while another politician is in office so who cares.

761 2018-10-23 22:29:29 Oh then just substitute butter for oil, same exact way. Using panty hose as a kind of ganja tea bag in the oil is just the easiest way ever IMO. You can wring it out then pour boiling water over it, keeps the green separated.
762 2018-10-23 22:29:29 no boiling oil from the battlements awaiting me?
763 2018-10-23 22:29:26 Yes to this... And I'm the same with baths! I have discovered a moisturising shower oil that heats up as you use it... The. Best.

772 2018-10-23 22:28:27 He holds the alledged tapes as bargain chips for November 4th, when the America's sanctions against Iran come into effect. Turkey will probably have to rely on SA for oil. As much as I dislike Erdo, he has a tump card up on his sleeve (i.e. cheap oil, or else....)

783 2018-10-23 22:26:32 I don't think the world leaders would have bowed to the ruler of Saudi Arabia if he didn't have oil to the degree that Saudis do. I think they and other producing states, almost all of whom, except Norway & Canada are dictatorships, have thrown their weight around because of oil.

789 2018-10-23 22:25:40 Which is why the whole leave it in the ground mob need to realise an independent Scotlands oil could well be used to forward that uptake , either in the form of h2 from oil , or using the taxes towards a NFP energy company without carbon and nuclear.

799 2018-10-23 22:24:49 Watched the interview last night. Liked what you said about a pipeline east to stop relying on the Saudis for oil. Never did understand why we want to sell our oil on the west coast, when we have to buy oil from other countries in eastern Canada.

804 2018-10-23 22:24:08 Cocaine Mitch.    Didn’t Obama have a oil deal in South America in which Soros got a big piece of the pie because he had “unknown” information???
805 2018-10-23 22:24:01 I think I'm starting to figure out why @Ford is going to stop making cars. If I collected all the oil my Fiesta leaks, I could power half of Nigeria.
806 2018-10-23 22:23:38 @LBBCnews chairman Sir Vincent Fean: “The many meetings over the last couple of days have highlighted the strong links established between the UK’s oil production, services and education and training companies with the NOC and its operating companies."
807 2018-10-23 22:23:38 They got some cash-flow help - not real help.  A 3bn deposit for one year and another 3bn of deferred payments for oil imports.
808 2018-10-23 22:23:27 It would be like @wossy and @grahnort joining forces on a Friday night talk show!! How the beeb didn't see the oil and water combination a mile off I don't know.
809 2018-10-23 22:23:27 I feel bad for the first guy who invented popcorn. I bet all he wanted was some really hot, dry, oil covered corn kernels and then they exploded on him :(
810 2018-10-23 22:23:23 Literally nothing. A little warm olive oil for dipping 
811 2018-10-23 22:23:19 False - Korea has a heavy bitumen refinery hungry for AB oil as does China. Only hypocrites and dummies like you continue to spread false facts.

816 2018-10-23 22:23:03 Bout at that point in my life where I quit my job and get myself and my loved ones caught up in a essential oil pyramid scheme
817 2018-10-23 22:23:02 Don't listen to @IamKirstyMack. Try using a cast iron skillet on broil in the oven. With butter/olive oil, garlic, and rosemary(which I'm sure you know). Maybe a fan also if you have one on your stovetop. Hope that helps! 
818 2018-10-23 22:23:00 so Canada can forgive billions in loans to private companies, give billions away to the oil and gas industry, but a $1B cancellation fee because of human rights abuses & murdering a journalist is too much? #priorities #saudiarmsdeal #KhashoggiMurder #FreedomOfSpeech #cdnpoli
819 2018-10-23 22:22:57 Correct. The two are unrelated though. As far as I know the sanctions are specifically tailored to oil imports. Chabahar hasn't been part of the sanctions discussion.

824 2018-10-23 22:22:02 Not how it works Hard to believe not one advisor can explain basic economic principles to president “good brain”. It remains unfathomable such an ignorant person is wielding such power. He’s a snake oil salesmen and you’re all buying it !
825 2018-10-23 22:21:49 @nikoli1ful  for your video "DIY Saab 9-5 Oil Trap Hose Install | How to | Repair" I need the check valve but don't know the part number. Can you help?
826 2018-10-23 22:21:24 Didn’t add rosemary or garlic. If you don’t care for carbs you can add honey.  A tsp. You can use olive oil instead of butter and you can mix in flakes as you mix the batter then sprinkle on top too
827 2018-10-23 22:21:20 That dude is growing flesh eating viruses and and cultures of the black plague out in the middle of that swamp! The bauyou is filling up with Saudi oil and the blood of journalists.
828 2018-10-23 22:21:00 Realizing that a teaspoon of olive oil is better than a tablespoon in almost every dish (you read that right)
829 2018-10-23 22:20:58 In Alberta Oil Companies payed over $1 Billion in land royalty tax to the AB government.  People working for oil companies in Alberta are some of the highest paid in the Province and and account for over HALF of the collected tax revenue, not including GST on their purchases.

837 2018-10-23 22:20:02 Fun fact I have no clue how to change the oil in my car and it took me 10 minutes to open the hood
838 2018-10-23 22:19:51 Where is the winning mentality gary!!! We satisfied with draw with oil money club and today we lost against a side historically we are very superior against. Do you know what mean man united? We are playing sh** football. Our DNA is lost.

841 2018-10-23 22:19:32 Do you use vegetable oil or butter
842 2018-10-23 22:19:31 おはようございます(*^^*)
843 2018-10-23 22:19:31 It’s amazing what an oil change will do for your car
844 2018-10-23 22:19:17 “It will no longer be free to pollute in Canada “ I don’t understand that concept. Home heating costs are insanely high especially for oil. New Brunswickers pay some of the highest natural gas prices in NA It was never free! It is already expensive to not freeze to death!#NBpoli

You might as well wear a Nazi uniform for your dog-eat-dog vision of America.
852 2018-10-23 22:18:33 I use to use mj for nausea from opioids but as I got older it would just make me tense which made my pain worse. I very much dislike the taste & smell. I've tried thc oils but didn't notice a difference in intensity of my pain. CBD oil seems 2 help burning pain from my arthritis
853 2018-10-23 22:18:30 Finally got my oil changed...
854 2018-10-23 22:18:26 Yup, really bad engine design. The timing chains (yes two of them) are in a V from the crank to each head. The tensioners are hydraulic from the oil pressure and a little o-ring is all that’s keeping it alive. Change your oil often!
855 2018-10-23 22:18:23 Pastor maybe production of oil in Saudi Arabia will stop! and at same time brexit !and freefall of one or two markets ;they will call in trillions in bonds!
856 2018-10-23 22:18:08 Got the parts to fix under my sink, getting my oil changed, and got my back room cleaned and organized. Adulting has been fun today 
857 2018-10-23 22:18:08 dems still blow up other countries for oil or because they elect a leader that isn't a puppet of US imperialism. ask me how much I care about ranked choice voting.
858 2018-10-23 22:17:57 Nobody likes the feeling of oil condensing on the surface of their skin after they cook. The pimple popping scene was the worst.
859 2018-10-23 22:17:54 When was the last time you checked your oil levels? Do this weekly, more so if you travel long distances. Never let your car run dry.
860 2018-10-23 22:17:48 Inept, inarticulate, defensive and arrogant, hiding his fear, attacking the plan rather than the immorality of its execution, hiding deeper lies and insecurities.

863 2018-10-23 22:17:23 Some sensor issue i think. The oil pressure light kept coming on. Better to get it checked than to have the hummer blow up on me
864 2018-10-23 22:17:22 Its economy but our prime concern is freedom from imported oil....
865 2018-10-23 22:17:19 They have oil, we need oil ...... that’s all it boils down to

876 2018-10-23 22:15:54 whos tryna change my oil
877 2018-10-23 22:15:53 I would like to get more info on this. It seems reasonable we should get better prices if shipping outside a constrained market like US. However it seems we get paid the same for oil shipping out of BC.
878 2018-10-23 22:15:53 See thats why we need to stop with these gender roles around kitchens and cooking if this boy had learned properly he would have known to take the lid of when ur frying otherwise that oil will take your eye out
879 2018-10-23 22:15:51 Extra funny in that this was like 20 years before the Kochs, and this literally being the family origin story (oil pipelines/refineries instead of shells)
880 2018-10-23 22:15:47 But the decline in recent days happened mainly because of the major increase in oil production in the last two months by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the UAE, and Russia!
881 2018-10-23 22:15:46 It's not just the oil. Everyone forgets the importance of the Hajj inside the world of Islam.  #tytlive
882 2018-10-23 22:15:45 I do not and cannot support a long term relationship with Saudi Arabia.
Every deal we make with them is a compromise to future security of our country.
Every dollar spent on oil, every missile or plane we ship to them is waste.

885 2018-10-23 22:14:21 @realDonaldTrump I will not step back in this case because I do not want those who created these scenarios to reach their dirty goal. The full boycott of Iranian oil by November 4th is very important and vital
886 2018-10-23 22:14:16 Not in top 15... guess oil not big on “finished goods and products”
887 2018-10-23 22:14:15 Trump said that the Saudi cover up was the worst cover up ever. I disagree, not releasing his tax returns is the biggest cover up ever! Saudis have always behaved in this way but their supplies of oil have bought support of western nations. Oil = $€£
888 2018-10-23 22:14:06 You're describing my Twitter career. 'Tread softly, because you tread on my ...stuff I thought was hilarious but obviously was devoid of any merit'. What we need to do is get a rake of baby oil, buff our asses till there's a shine that'd blind you, and post the pic. ..You first..
889 2018-10-23 22:14:00 Jared, if free market had anything to do with it, then oil would be way more expensive.  Guess which companies received billions of dollars of tax breaks, and subsidies?  Oh, thats right, oil and gas companies.  Or do you not understand what subsidies are?
890 2018-10-23 22:13:57 You coat the pan with real butter instead of oil or spray or margarine, but the mayo goes in a thin layer on the bread
891 2018-10-23 22:13:51 On oil it is not as simple as that. Prices fell on the back of financial turmoil and Opec trying to pump to capacity to make for the loss of Iranian exports and pretty much overdoing it. Oil will eventually trade back up.
892 2018-10-23 22:13:48 The number of ingredients in a recipe on a food blog is inversely proportional to the word count preceding. “Preheat oven to 425, boil halved red potatoes for 15 minutes, spread out on tray, smash with fork, cover with olive oil/spices, cook for 20 minutes” = 6,000 words.

895 2018-10-23 22:13:31 It's pretty bad in BC too. Like, piteous. Like, let me repeat myself: BC is having it's long awaited oil boom right now and is 100% f*cking it up.
896 2018-10-23 22:13:02 @realDonaldTrump in The most difficult moments I helped Tramp and he never hurt my advice. The importance of a full boycott of oil is very high, and certainly will affect the November election,
897 2018-10-23 22:12:55 Maybe we should allow the people different options. Anyone there heard of Medical Marajuana? CBD oil? Anyone? Google it! Thanks

900 2018-10-23 22:12:51 Senator I guess all of you want to wait for them to make their move! Sir I think they will hit EVERYTHING at same time !with freefall of at least one market !block production of oil ;maybe brexit !and all  cash in on all large U.S .BONDS!
901 2018-10-23 22:12:48 if it’s oil than that’s a cheap fix haha
902 2018-10-23 22:12:46 Osborne slashed the oil revenues by cutting taxes, Norway didn't. Income tax rate that suits Scotland, we won't be paying towards london’s housing benefit bill or the pensioners in SE England that live until they are 110

907 2018-10-23 22:12:00 Do you know the reasons? Ever heard of shale oil? It’s the new shiny diamond. Oil sands are expensive and more than one bank has recommended consolidation to reduce costs. That means fewer larger players. And oil is in sunset initiation. Why do you think Saudis diversifying?

928 2018-10-23 22:08:46 Also, make the sanctions disfavour oil export. The Saudis should be able to make and export solar panels, wind turbines, etc.
929 2018-10-23 22:08:46 Hmm. Coconut oil is good for short term moisturizing and not sticking to things...but aquaphor stays on a lot longer. I'm torn
930 2018-10-23 22:08:45 Well.. Looking at the oil price today it is safe to say that no one cares about depletion. At least until it starts to produce draws.

932 2018-10-23 22:08:25 Don't get me started on crackers. Dinosaurs turned in to oil, then mined and turned into a plastic spider, flown half way around the world to be thrown straight in to the bin, or swallowed by the baby. What a waste of the Earth's resources.
933 2018-10-23 22:08:12 Yeah riiiiight , you are one of the biggest fossil fuel suck ups in Washington. How much have the big oil and health insurance lobbyists given you? GO HOME!
934 2018-10-23 22:08:11 Jiayou! Add oil!

938 2018-10-23 22:07:33 Please, don't forget to check your lubricants' level tomorrow, especially the power steering oil, most people ignore it.
Also, no matter how new or gallant you think your car is, check the water level in the radiator and don't forget to cover it tightly after doing so.

940 2018-10-23 22:07:31 up which Putin could not afford.  In the long term Putin knows he needs accesss to Western capital markets because the price of oil will decline.  At nearly $100/barrell Russia has a short term influx of money but there is a long term move away from oil whihc $100/B hastens. /5

942 2018-10-23 22:07:16 Everyday I learn something new about being a Chilihead. Loved all the priceless feedback I received from my facility managers yesterday. Time to baby my Henny. Keep the oil clean just like on my car, they cost about the same! Filter, filter, filter!! #hennylove @ChilisJobs

953 2018-10-23 22:06:02 i just got coconut oil in my eye and now i’m blind love that
954 2018-10-23 22:05:58 The three largest oil producing countries in the world are: Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Russia. We already have economic sanctions on two out of three of those countries. You put sanctions on the Saudi's, they get OPEC to raise prices on oil = We are all fucked.
955 2018-10-23 22:05:48 Trump is like a snake oil salesman that goes from village to village selling dreams that will never come true. The lies are only as good as those who believe them. Every bully only partners with his victims.
956 2018-10-23 22:05:22 What is new , it was always and still all oil and gas ventures in Egypt and Israel have close relationship with government one way or another. For novices is    news but anyone knows the area and industry it is business as usual
957 2018-10-23 22:05:13 You remember correctly, or at least partly. I was advocating that the Government seriously look at NEW rail transportation options for Alberta oil, like G7G. I was not advocating adding even more tank cars to an already crowded rail network.
958 2018-10-23 22:05:06 This is the secret code that actually says, “No, the US is just saying they will do that, they’re really sending more money for more oil.” That’s the ACTUAL story.
959 2018-10-23 22:05:00 This seems to stem from oil SA & US are stealing from Yemen.

We need to stop our dependence on oil!  Until then, we are all partially to blame for this!
960 2018-10-23 22:04:57 I thought my car was overdue for an oil change but turns out that ‘cars these days’ go twice as long before a change.

964 2018-10-23 22:04:06 What price? Oil? Money? These mean nothing to them.  Hellfire dropped from the heavens would send a message.
965 2018-10-23 22:03:58 Not really, after all most of the Arab rulers including the Saudi ruling family were implemented by the west, by Britain to be precise, there are rules set, oil, wealth for the throne
966 2018-10-23 22:03:57 Listen to you spout about American values. 
Moral-less. 
Hypocrite. 
Insider Trading Expert. 
Regardless of the effects on Americans, you would push Trump into a war, alienate an ally, or screw up the oil markets. 
Anything to get back power.
967 2018-10-23 22:03:43 You're joking, right? Venezuela is an oil rich country. The peasantry is starving, the leadership is fat & happy.  It's absolutely conceivable that Maduro has financed this charade.
968 2018-10-23 22:03:22 This has nothing to do with energy efficiency, it's more to do with Gerald Butts shutting down Canada's oil industry. Consumers and business will be the ones to take the hit here. I'm a small business owner and this will affect my bottom line.

Basically, by your obedience to God in separating yourself from them, your light is not dimmed, nor your oil contaminated, enabling you to remain filled with both, so that from a distance, they will see the light of Christ in you and be drawn to you...
972 2018-10-23 22:03:04 It’s quite strange if u think about it. 2 believe that 9/11 was an inside job absolves Muslims from any blame & supports the narrative the US was after Iraqi oil. That shows that Muslims r the victims of a conspiracy, the defence which has been raised in these grooming trials.

How about vote anticorruption?

981 2018-10-23 22:02:33 Hoops usually result in more hypertrophic scarring than studs do, so if you have a hoop in that might be why it’s forming. If the piercing is still super tender I wouldn’t mess with it though. Tea tree oil in very small amounts works pretty well, but I would do sea salt soaks
982 2018-10-23 22:02:30 All our leaders know that if the Saudis stop making oil deals in US bills we lose a major economic key   strength. After WWII we made a deal so they traded oil in US dollars to keep up the value of our currency
983 2018-10-23 22:02:29 Try peppermint oil. Helps with my migraines
984 2018-10-23 22:01:59 We don't need Saudi for our oil. If Trump gives in he is a total coward. The Magnitsky Act needs to be used to stop these human rights violations.

1008 2018-10-23 21:59:29 Here is some simple math for you : If everyone used less of everything - bc most things are made/transported using oil - the economy (such as it is) would collapse. Maybe think about it for a few seconds.

1017 2018-10-23 21:59:03 More silliness from the left. I thought that the great the U.S. was supposed to be the great melting pot of cultures, not oil and water.

Saying that there is cultural appropriation is teaching hate and divides people instead of bringing them together.

1021 2018-10-23 21:58:43 Oil in Alberta is going the same way as the history of nitrates in Chile.

1028 2018-10-23 21:58:01 Agreed, Trump is a snake oil salesman. But he literally went around the Rust Belt promising to "bring back jobs" while HRC was boasting about how "America is already great." Some were more willing to throw the orange brick through the window of the establishment and hope he'd pay
1029 2018-10-23 21:57:42 Anyone in Morgantown, don’t go to Summer’s Repair if you need work done on your car. They’ll fuck up your oil change and leave you stranded on the fucking highway

1033 2018-10-23 21:57:25 May Allah punish the perpetrators of this horrible heinous crime, may they not know peace.
1034 2018-10-23 21:57:11 Because we sell them millions in arms. Ironically, they aren't the major country we import oil from any more. That would be Canada.
1035 2018-10-23 21:57:11 Make no mistake: the killing of Khashoggi was designed to force sanctions on the Saudis and boost the price of oil, to prompt a worldwide recession, destroy the Trump economy, and get more socialists elected. Take it to the bank. Soros is in on it.

1039 2018-10-23 21:56:37 Probably due to low oil. Oil also cools as well as lubricate so is more likely. If it was timing chain once it's slipped it's slipped. Would do it constantly.
1040 2018-10-23 21:56:30 I’d recommend Breathe by doterra. It’s the only thing that clears up my stuffy nose! Dilute it with coconut oil and apply it all around his sinus areas, temples and behind the ears, it will begin draining within minutes!
1041 2018-10-23 21:56:29 The world has boomeranged so quick traditional skills are more in vogue now than the snake oil being peddled by these ignoramuses.

1053 2018-10-23 21:55:11 Update 1: homie is aggressively browsing the motor oil section. Yeah man people do actually take care of these things themselves. Like me, though, you're too goddamn lazy to do it on this gloomy Tuesday evening. #chilloutbro

1057 2018-10-23 21:54:49 Or.... both?  If someone feels that “Green” is the way to go then they can certainly build a Solar or Wind System and sell the electricity- just like companies can still oil and gas wells and sell their product.

1065 2018-10-23 21:53:35 Sad times when fans are wishing for Saudi Oil money ala City / Chelsea. Club is fucked.
1066 2018-10-23 21:53:35 With oil price increase this will surge up! Chalo ALLAH malik hai
1067 2018-10-23 21:53:28 You wanna protest a pipeline then go work in an oil field?!?! Yea me neither cause that’s fucking stupid as shit.
1068 2018-10-23 21:53:22 It’s easy to make. I don’t really measure anything when I cook. You just sauté some onions and garlic in olive oil. Throw in chopped celery and carrots, a 32 oz thing of chicken stock. Let it cook. Throw in a can of diced tomatoes and then some spinach. (1/2)
1069 2018-10-23 21:53:14 I’m confused.  Did he deal in snake (sic) oil? Or do you some how think he was against the US.
1070 2018-10-23 21:52:42 Trudeau wants us all to live in one big Beijing like city. A carbon tax favours urban over rural. It’s anti-north, anti-rural, amd anti-agriculture.
The Left doesn’t like oil, mining, and now ag. What’s left for Canada but jobs processing rebate cheques.
1071 2018-10-23 21:52:28 It’s the CBD isolate that’s new. You can take it orally but it’s better in an alcohol tincture. The CBD in oil isn’t strong enough,has to be in alcohol & it works better directly on your skin where the pain is. I roll it all over my neck and throat and lower back over my spine.
1072 2018-10-23 21:52:28 That might be true but dont forget that Norway is a country of 4 Million with Billions of free Dollars coming from their ressources, mainly oil.
1073 2018-10-23 21:52:26 Reactive measure. If like to know how many oil interests were linked to it, regardless of nationalities and religions. One bond for sure $$$, control, amorality, stupid evil short term thinking, stupidity.
1074 2018-10-23 21:52:21 Prime Minister Trudeau’s policies have ruined Alberta’s economy. Calgary has an unemployment rate of 8.3%. Canada should be self-sufficient in supplying enough oil for our own use. Getting oil from Saudi Arabia is a ridiculous, costly move!
1075 2018-10-23 21:52:12 tea tree oil works wonders on acne
1076 2018-10-23 21:52:11 Who wanna be a real one & bring me bread from CPK with olive oil & balsamic vinegar?  I been craving for a week
1077 2018-10-23 21:52:02 Did you know that NM's Medicaid expansion has created more jobs in NM in the past 6 years than the booming oil & gas industry?  AND it's provided health carecoverage to >300,000 New Mexicans while more than paying for itself! Medicaid is vital to building a #StrongerNM #nmleg
1078 2018-10-23 21:51:47 Not sure what monopolies you mean?  You do know that you - CarlyAB - could drill an oil well and produce it, right?  Or purchase one of thousands for sale in Alberta?
1079 2018-10-23 21:51:40 i got oil paint on the pants im painting and im devastated rip
1080 2018-10-23 21:51:37 Anybody selling cheap Oil tickets to tonight’s game?! Holla @ ya girl
1081 2018-10-23 21:51:37 Getting my oil changed so ofc he’s telling me my air filters are dirty and I need to rotate my tires and a zillion other things that I don’t understand and can’t afford stop
1082 2018-10-23 21:51:35 Dreamt that big oil put a hit on me because of eco/climate research I was publishing and woke up feeling fucking fantastic
1083 2018-10-23 21:51:34 I've had one before, but not since I developed a soy allergy, cuz fryolater oil, don'tcha know. :-)
1084 2018-10-23 21:51:26 The country was doing well because it was propped up by high oil prices. When oil prices collapse in 2012 so did the economy. This mess began around then. Then u have Maduro with his high school economics printing and flooding the economy with money causing the hyperinflation.

1086 2018-10-23 21:51:11 My issues: 1. Dopey tariffs (aluminum and steel in particular) are fueling inflation 2. Fed is being way too aggressive in raising rates seeming to use wage growth (a good thing?) as key barometer. 3. Oil 4. Trump incessantly shooting himself in the foot!
1087 2018-10-23 21:51:05 Crumble it in pieces and pour olive oil on it – it is a grain offering.  Leviticus 2:6
1088 2018-10-23 21:50:52 Maybe start an EV lobby group to counter oil.
1089 2018-10-23 21:50:50 I buy oil, but I’ve wanted to make butter to bake with for years. Brownies etc. Love to try gummies. I can’t smoke pot, I can’t breathe
1090 2018-10-23 21:50:42 I told Johnny i was taking my car to get an oil change and he was annoyed. Talkin bout "Ima mechanic for a reason." I pulled up to the shop and he looked so handsome in his work clothes.  Geez
1091 2018-10-23 21:50:38 I'm all for doing our part to make our planet cleaner.  Eventually, the world will be powered by the sun, battery and nuclear energy.  Oil will be the new rotary phone.  But this carbon tax thing is not the way to go.  I don't trust it at all, I don't trust politicians.
1092 2018-10-23 21:50:30 Also kill two birds with one stone....get that Canada East pipeline built and give the Saudis a F-U. And use that oil money to use to help reduce carbon here(reno incentive). It will also help our industries who have very low emission compared to where we import from.
1093 2018-10-23 21:50:21 I think we should stop buying their oil, but continue selling the weapons. Let them break the contract. Won’t cost us a thing, and AB can sell its oil to On and QC
1094 2018-10-23 21:50:21 Baby oil naman eh -_-
1095 2018-10-23 21:50:19 I’m going to put this tweet on the side of a campaign bus a drive across the great state of Texas!

1098 2018-10-23 21:50:07 Hundreds of Saudi princes are waiting in line to become king,no one of them could distance himself from the USA,neither they could afford to cut oil supply again,when they USA decides that MBS no longer serve their interests he could be replaced easily,but  he is Israel’s guy.
1099 2018-10-23 21:50:07 i feel like such an adult for going to get an oil change for the first time 
1100 2018-10-23 21:50:06 Maybe our government could help us be less reliant on oil producers by subsidising alternative energy? Oh wait - tories are cutting subsidies to electric cars and abandoning the one on plug in hybrids in November. The Saudis are balls deep in the #CONservative party.  #Newsnight
1101 2018-10-23 21:49:55 CBD Oil + Farmers + Kansas = Fill in the blank Kris. #1 natural cure for anxiety and PTSD Big Pharma does not want the public to know about. Bottom line: Farmers vs. Big Pharma.
1102 2018-10-23 21:49:51 I’ve been using their standards! The g pen, hard pencil, and flat oil paint brush usually work best for me
You can always toggle the brush density, opacity, or the amount of paint till you’ve got something you like!!
1103 2018-10-23 21:49:50 Actually you forgot him with baby oil that really put him over the top
1104 2018-10-23 21:49:50 Yes. We have lowered our dependence on foreign oil to the be point we can makes it up with Canadian or Mexican oil.
1105 2018-10-23 21:49:48 I was on both too along with straterra and I just got off them after years of taking them.  I’m probably going to try CBD oil? I got something to take when needed but I forget.
1106 2018-10-23 21:49:34 I should put more attention ntowards skin care and self care tbh. I out the tiniest amount of almond oil on my skin and it's been soaked up like if that's not a sign of bad idk what is
1107 2018-10-23 21:49:15 Tearing up the Mideast was HRC and Obama’s contribution to Globalism. Paying Iran and setting up Russia meddling in @DNC too. Causing sanctions against Russia would opened doors for Iran in Europe Oil Market, another gift to Globalism. Still Think this happened without script?

1111 2018-10-23 21:48:58 Post Office closed tomorrow, Brian did CBD oil and bit his own fingers off cos he thought they were baby courgettes.
1112 2018-10-23 21:48:44 Does anyone know how much oil we import (from different sources) in terms of money/year?

1115 2018-10-23 21:48:17 They'll say that the petrol at the pump now is the more expensive crude oil bought before the fall. However, it never works the other way.

1122 2018-10-23 21:47:10 About a year ago I thought Mr. Starke was a proponent for oil by rail??  I think there is/was a Facebook link even.  The g7g or something like that?

1126 2018-10-23 21:46:56 It hurts drying up your milk! It was so painful for me!! Just keep cabbage or broccoli on and if you have any peppermint oil! Put it around your boobs! Helped me! And just keep up on ibuprofen or Tylenol!

1130 2018-10-23 21:46:16 Check your Transmission oil today.
1131 2018-10-23 21:46:10 First, there has to be a comprehensive understanding that we have all the resources from economic growth. From land, water, limestone, coal, cocoa, etc. All these I have mentioned without stating the obvious, crude oil.
1132 2018-10-23 21:46:05 That's mainly due to the difficulty of getting purified hydrogen. If there's more production costs will drop. It's cyclical. Same thing happened when drilling for oil was made possible, killed the whaling industry
1133 2018-10-23 21:46:01 i totally understand that feel. i think easiest thing to fry is definitely tempura as it doesn’t take long and you can just get a box of tempura batter, just add soda water. otherwise, you could shallow fry potato chunks in a skillet with canola oil? that’d be pretty easy
1134 2018-10-23 21:45:47 sanctions on Saudi oil would be one of the best things ever to happen for preventing climate change, given the boost it would give to renewable energy and electric cars #newsnight

1136 2018-10-23 21:45:39 Senator think this out the issue what happened with kavanaugh ?this murder of journalist ;am I jumping the issue? there is only one move for them! they can even stop oil at any given day ;then what?
1137 2018-10-23 21:45:38 Vote like your planet depends on it. We can’t let the GOP #PlanetKILLERS take humanity down the drain all for their donors’ extra profits. Think of this stage of humanity as being a raging alcoholic with oil as the intoxicant.
1138 2018-10-23 21:45:11 Saudi Arabia has oil and billions! 
Russia has a stock pile of nukes!
What does Israel have except dragging the U.S. into pointless, devastating, and expensive wars?
1139 2018-10-23 21:44:57 My impression is that these builds are down to low exports of US crude oil along with rising production. Refiners choose what they import they have no control over what is produced.
1140 2018-10-23 21:44:45 This trend is going on around the world. Nationalism at its peak. It's good to be patriotic and nationalist but not at the expense of spreading hate mongering sweeping statements regarding whole race of people. These same middle eastern fill your pockets with OIL. Have some shame
1141 2018-10-23 21:44:44 The old fiestas were oil burners and death traps - but then again, so was every other subcompact in the 90s XD
Ford and mazda shared platforms back then, so it was basically a mazda 121 with a ford engine.

They're still really popular in the uk because of their size.

1151 2018-10-23 21:43:46 cooking oil was the mistake
1152 2018-10-23 21:43:34 80% of the US economy consists of services, so this is a major advantage that the US has in trading with Canada. Canada sells goods like crude oil and lumber to the US, because Canada has far more crude oil and lumber than the US has. In return, the US sells services to Canada.
1153 2018-10-23 21:43:27 Ilove how our country is just there to supply England. Oil, electricity, water, military etc. God how I love the colonialism.
1154 2018-10-23 21:43:13 Our deals is worth more than + $50 billion on opening day in oil, gas, industries & infrastructure sectors with firms such as Trafigura, Total, Hyundai, Norinco, Schlumberger, Halliburton and Baker Hughes.

1161 2018-10-23 21:42:44 There is no comparison. China is the world’s biggest trader in goods & the largest trade partner for many countries. E.g. it imports from Germany 60% more than the US does. Saudi Arabia sells oil & is not even in the top ten of Germany’s partners either in exports or imports
1162 2018-10-23 21:42:40 Adaptation is so important, it has replaced mitigating CO2 in more ways than many recognize.  Adaptation is welcome by the oil and gas industry, and many others collecting rent from its effects, or escaping the true liability of CO2. "HAWKS" s/b more careful @laurafish1

1168 2018-10-23 21:42:09 Well then we just drill for oil and pour it on the flames of the sun! Of course we need to avoid burning up our spaceship, so we only send it up at night! 
1169 2018-10-23 21:42:08 oh yah, getting my lay off slip at the end of the month. I was in a strong industry and they just can't keep it together. I'm in Alberta.  Not oil or gas related.
1170 2018-10-23 21:41:41 We don't get much oil from Saudi Arabia. Iran is the most stable country in the middle East.
1171 2018-10-23 21:41:38 The Naira was actually already falling before he came in, & then it dropped really steeply but his govt has been able to shore up the value & kept it steady. With our dependence on imports, & oil being our major source of Forex, there was no way a fall in prices wldn't affect
1172 2018-10-23 21:41:37 Anointed oil. Not red oil nor groundnut oil. If realized ow olamide starts u will concur that the oil on his head never run dry. Son of grace ..... @olamide_YBNL baddo sneh.
1173 2018-10-23 21:41:34 That’s what happens when the company is so involved in criminal activity it doesn’t do any maintenance. Soon Venezuela will only be sitting on all that oil and no way to retrieve it
1174 2018-10-23 21:41:21 Only because I just saw a similar story on Snapchat about communities in California near oil drilling site causing health problems in the children. And this girl started a movement and got the oil company shut down.
1175 2018-10-23 21:41:10 Yee, Nigerians don't expect VP to do a shit, but would condone him becoming a Millionaire through VP. Weldone smart man. Don't ask me for evidence but how how much do you guess @atiku embezzled? Why would same VP position afford him Oil blocks? How much does @atiku worth b4 VP?
1176 2018-10-23 21:41:04 < me a favor and nut as soon as you can, yeah? We're gonna be milking this cock o' yours today," she stated with a smirk, continuing to shoot oil over his dick and her feet.
1177 2018-10-23 21:41:01 How about a question on ENERGY. Fracking, misappropriating Hydro power, natural gas pipelines to heat home to get NYC off oil heat. Sadly the next debate will be not a bashing of Cuomo without him there to attempt to justify re-election

Even if we were consuming light, the sun is scheduled to swallow earth in 7.5 billion years.  A significant difference.

Having eastern canada buy conventional oil and gas from western canada would be smart.  But not bitumen.  The tar sands are dead.  Too polluting.
1192 2018-10-23 21:39:37 I love how we can go to war for obvious offenses, but with oil involved it’s all “due process.”
1193 2018-10-23 21:39:26 I worked the Public Sector for 15 years and private industry for 25 years. When the Province lost a large portion of their tax revenue from the down turn in Oil & Gas they really didn’t cut spending. You can’t live beyond your means without consequence.

1198 2018-10-23 21:39:13 Also to blame is woeful handling of business rates review by the SNP government which hit at same time as oil downturn ...
1199 2018-10-23 21:38:52 Oh man, waiting to get my oil changed the other day was terrifying. An ad would come on and I'd reflexively look around the waiting room to see who was nodding in agreement or rolling their eyes.
1200 2018-10-23 21:38:48 “This ain’t the first time you’ve seen it.”

One tug and out came that third leg, 26 inches of limp meat ready to be tugged and it only got longer from there.

1203 2018-10-23 21:38:36 Wait, the price of gas is tied to the price of oil? I thought @fordnation had complete control over it. I’m so confused.

1209 2018-10-23 21:37:38 When the mess started in 1998, the oil barrel price was $12,28 and then increased progressively to reach $109.45 in 2012. By then the country was almost destroyed.

1212 2018-10-23 21:37:34 I asked ole dude to change my oil for me THIS MORNING and he came to get it from my work, changed my oil, topped off all my fluids,  filled up my tires and washed it 
1213 2018-10-23 21:37:33 Porn and limewire is like oil and water ...
1214 2018-10-23 21:37:33 You still RT’ing this bull manure? Maybe you think a bucket brigade can carry our oil to the east coast refineries to replace the Saudi oil? #InsufferableAsshat
1215 2018-10-23 21:37:33 Its so important for women to know the basic necessities for a car. Like how to check the oil and fluids .

me: [remembering that guys like low maintenance girls] i only get my oil changed like, once a year.
1224 2018-10-23 21:36:30 In 20 years time,  no oil left, therefore small countries like Qatar and Kuwait are feeling threatened.
1225 2018-10-23 21:36:13 What you say about oil and arms is correct. But the US has had a chance to distance itself from Saudi oil dominance since the 1973 Arab Oil Embargo during which time the Sauds cut off oil to the  US.  As for liars,  we have our own Hillary blaming Benghazi on a anti Muslim video.

1246 2018-10-23 21:33:25 So, logically, it would be “staggering hypocrisy” for a fossil fuel company to promote its own line of solar panels and wind turbines while continuing to sell oil.  And it would be “staggering hypocrisy” for a junk food company to promote a new line of health foods...
1247 2018-10-23 21:33:19 Car manufacturers are going electric, the power sector is evolving to make emission a history but we're still dependent on oil export to keep the 'revenue-wheel' running.

Will this scale still be balanced in the nearest future? I guess the most oil usage is to produce energy. 
1248 2018-10-23 21:32:55 New tread  All you need is the oil obviously the oil filter , that’s it but wait did you buy the oil & oil filter yourself or did they get it for you ?

1264 2018-10-23 21:30:59 The fact that you don’t know that makes me question how knowledgeable you are on how intertwined your life is with petroleum. Do a little research on how oil is used in your everyday life. You may be surprised and start to rethink how hard getting off oil is going to be.
1265 2018-10-23 21:30:51 So I read there is an oil spill that is worse than the Deepwater Horizon one. Never hear about it on the news. Who cares, right? Let’s just get rid of every living thing on the planet. The oil’s not in my yard, so who cares?

1290 2018-10-23 21:28:18 Explain why the arguments are invalid. How is diesel exhaust 15 feet from classrooms ok? How is drilling through methane—which blew up houses in MA a few weeks ago—ok? How is drilling through oil—which caused cancer in numerous ppl until the pump was dismantled—ok?

1297 2018-10-23 21:27:30 Of course. But demand is impacted by the propaganda that comes from the people selling snake oil. And it’s human nature we are up against, not ignorance. Smarter people still believe in nonsense, and are often more refractory to education because they are better at rationalizing.

1305 2018-10-23 21:26:33 You just said that it was ok to continue using oil for those products and current pipelines should be enough didn’t you? Pretty sure you did. So....how will we get the oil out of the ground to refine, and make those products?
1306 2018-10-23 21:26:32 PROFIT = REVENUE - COST

For Dow to justify being at 25k, cost of doing business, energy, crude oil, should be quite low, not quite high.

These are simple natural laws.

Oil at five dollars, yes, Dow can be at 25k.
1307 2018-10-23 21:26:23 While this maybe true, why doesn’t @JustinTrudeau stop the import of Saudi Arabian’s oil? Canada doesn’t need their oil...

1324 2018-10-23 21:24:34 Yeah no I can't do that - that sucks
I need my oil + acrylic paints

1326 2018-10-23 21:24:14 I think you can rub some kind of edible oil or something on there. Might be like coconut or something but I’m not a hippy.
1327 2018-10-23 21:24:14 for this year yes it is $6Billion.

But as part of the MOU, it's decided that Saudia will continue to offer Oil to Pakistan on deferred payments worth $3Billion each for next 2 years (additional $6Billion) and after 3 years this deal will be revisited.
1328 2018-10-23 21:24:12 So true! I was a SAHM (old Gen X) and took care of oil changes, renewing license plates, making dr. appts, groceries, paying bills, etc because I had time. Now we both work and some things took a while to balance out.
1329 2018-10-23 21:24:07 Fold in four pinches of olive oil and put back on heat.
1330 2018-10-23 21:24:00 Texas is helping America to produce and export record amounts of oil, resulting in local and national economic growth! Click here to support jobs in Texas!
1331 2018-10-23 21:24:00 Im at the dealership getting an oil changed and I'm laughing my ass off. Then I remembered your wife when she fell. I start cracking up even more. People are looking at me like I'm crazy. I got a good laugh. Thanks yall I really had laugh that good in a while.

1333 2018-10-23 21:23:53 Anointing oil got finished on Vincent Kompany’s head, so he no reach Man U players
1334 2018-10-23 21:23:48 Still think Felix will be the best of the bunch but it is pretty cool to have so many great players in Canada. In all honesty, never thought I would see the day.
1335 2018-10-23 21:23:40 Here's the deal: If you find olive oil and flour and stuff in a man's cupboard, it's usually because a woman left it there, not because he knows what to do with it.

1336 2018-10-23 21:23:37 You know your car dirty when you go to get an oil change and the worker offers to wash it for you 
1337 2018-10-23 21:23:29 Always nice to know people ;). My neighbours had them at our old address. We didn't spend enough on oil to justify cost. They had them more than 10 years. They had Keep Cool Refrigeration on speed dial.
1338 2018-10-23 21:23:23 i’m waiting to get an oil change and someone in the lobby is snoring what

1343 2018-10-23 21:22:42 Since the president says I can’t be a chick, now I’m a dude. I love lifting weights (4-Locos and Monster), changing the oil in my truck, and the comedy stylings of Louis CK. Back the fuck up cuz this guy is gonna be CEO of your ladyparts.

1352 2018-10-23 21:21:51 Those vile fucking Saudis. If only ‘our’ oil wasn’t under their sand and they didn’t buy £1.3billions worth of armaments from us every year, then we’d definitely take some decisive action .........#Khashoggi #diplomacy #realpolitik #Islam
1353 2018-10-23 21:21:45 I don’t guess my dad yells at me enough about changing my oil because I’m 10,000 miles and 3 months past a change 
1354 2018-10-23 21:21:33 I’m currently learning a lot about how/where olives for olive oil are grown impacts the quality and its very interesting seeing the similarities it has with wine
1355 2018-10-23 21:21:32 i’m almost completely out of gas, 1,000 miles overdue for an oil change, my oil light came on yesterday, and i don’t have time to take my car to subaru until tomorrow morning (if they can even fit me in before work) wish me luck gents

1361 2018-10-23 21:21:06 If whiskey was $0.13 US per litre, I wouldn't care. 
It is not, so Canadians should care. 
Let's build Whiskey East and Tequila Mountain pipelines.
Shh we will also use it for oil when the Libs and Greenies are drunk.
1362 2018-10-23 21:20:54 Regarding Obama and the economy...I think the only credit Obama should get is that he changed the oil and didn't lose the car keys. Trump took the keys from Obama and started the motor, which is now running nicely. Thank you very much.
1363 2018-10-23 21:20:47 I'd tell him the sun won't dim for another 4 billion years, and we will run out of oil and coal well before then.
1364 2018-10-23 21:20:37 Never believe these lying ass white folks in this administration,unless you're crazy?I don't believe these immigrants are funded by Venezuela they already have monetary obligations in their own country!Don't forget #Thump would like military intervention there to steal their oil!
1365 2018-10-23 21:20:37 You can even try it at first with like a quarter of bud. Just match amounts, 1/4 oz to 1/4 cup, etc. It'll really take in about 4 hours but why do all that just to get lame oil? Last batch I made I waited about 12 hours with a buncha stirring and yeah buddy lol
1366 2018-10-23 21:20:28 Crude #oil down nearly 5% on mix of macro sell-off, #SaudiaArabia signals on production, and demand worries in emerging markets. Brent traded as low as $75.88 a barrel today; in early October it hit $86.74 a barrel | #OOTT #commodities
1367 2018-10-23 21:20:27 You know the root of the problem, NicolASS Maduro finances this caravan and many other ilegal actions all over the world with venezuelan blood dolars obtained by suplying oil to Citgo in the US.

1385 2018-10-23 21:18:42 It's funny when my doctors flip flop on how they feel about me taking my medication... If only they knew their trash ass Tramadol doesn't even work as well as CBD oil, I just feel weird about buying CBD oil & using it outside the comfort of my home, which is necessary at times
1386 2018-10-23 21:18:37 Yes I remember Teri @HatchingChange saying about the cucumber oil, was it Kiehl’s cucumber oil!?.Also seem to remember Dean saying something along the lines of he doesn’t wear aftershave as he has asthma!?.I’m talking like 20+ years ago I seem to remember, so I may be mistaken!.
1387 2018-10-23 21:18:34 As a liberal I can admit that Bill Clinton “soiled” the reputation of #POTUS - but Trump? He’s a carnival barker selling snake oil to anyone who “likes him”. We are a laughing stock.

1389 2018-10-23 21:18:02 Just think how safer railways would be if they were not being used as a conduit for oil. 

We need to get TMX, Northern Gateway, and Energy East going. Not just for export purposes, but for energy security with things looking even less stable in the Middle East.
1390 2018-10-23 21:17:55 Nahhh that's a waste of $. It's so ridiculously easy, just like making Idk truffle butter or whatever. I just did it a bunch n got the right method for me eventually. 
Only thing to look out for is don't bake it too long and if the oil starts to smell nutty, turn the heat off.
1391 2018-10-23 21:17:51 I swear to g I was talking about this to Maggie yesterday. Massage and Exfoliate them with baking soda and olive oil. Keep them shits moisturized AF. Also practice not smiling.  Egg whites help keep your face firm. You can use it under your makeup too. Gross but natural Botox
1392 2018-10-23 21:17:50 True inflation was lower then, 2014-2016 shows decline in WORLD oil price hikes, not the brilliance of the previous admin.

Have a retrieval drone intercept the capsule and put it in path of the stations orbit to capture the capsule.

1401 2018-10-23 21:16:56 Saudis seem to be a bunch of jumped up liars. If the world did not need oil and if arms sales could be banned we would all be better off and the Middle East would be back in its place and not causing international chaos.

1413 2018-10-23 21:15:44 Depends on the design, the brand etc. I work in the industry so I would be getting a different price for install and supply than someone off the street .  It is by far much more efficient than oil or electric when done right . Being done right is the key
1414 2018-10-23 21:15:42 This vanilla and mango beard oil is next level
1415 2018-10-23 21:15:36 @AAACares yeah I’m just curious why if you were gonna fail me on my inspection and let me know I need a $4,000 repair why you continued to do and charge me for an oil change because now I’m out the money from the oil change that is a complete waste.
1416 2018-10-23 21:15:02 Nigeria's Economy
Nigeria  has been the best example of "paradox of plenty." Its natural resources, especially its light "sweet" crude oil, create great wealth that begets "extravagant corruption, deep poverty, polarized income distributions, and poor economic performance."

Let’s get this water, sugar, dry yeast, salt, vegetable oil, and flour to make this bread
1423 2018-10-23 21:14:23 Sure have, same recipe. I've also done the double boiler method. Oh man I forgot, for less taste you can add water to the oil BUT eventually you gotta skim that and it can get moldy so I avoid it.
1424 2018-10-23 21:14:15 Oil changes... Hate them. Next car will be all electric
1425 2018-10-23 21:13:58 There are several good reasons why America does not want a war with Saudi Arabia and should not start one. 1) they control the oil and set the prices. 2) They speak for Sunni Islam, are stewards of Mecca, so any attack on them will be deemed an attack on Sunni Muslims.
1426 2018-10-23 21:13:53 Agree.
I was working and living there in the end 80's when it all started. Even THEN it was clear it was going to end up in tears.
Carbon copy of what EFF stands for.
Chaves managed for a while longer because of the USD 120 oil price. After that it was downhill fast.
1427 2018-10-23 21:13:49 I think international oil should be managed wisely.
As a fishing ground, there should be no negative impact on Iran's control over the aftermath of Saudi Arabia.

1437 2018-10-23 21:12:23 He claims credit for oil production AFTER he did everything in his power to block oil production.

Now claiming credit for the economy when it was Trump lowered taxes, and lowered corporate taxes.
Those tax cuts is why the economy is better not O____bama.
1438 2018-10-23 21:12:20 Marinate the chicken breasts in olive oil, soy sauce, salt, pepper and brown sugar for thirty minutes, pan fry on medium heat until dark color starts to form on both sides. Serve with potatoes or vegetables.
1439 2018-10-23 21:12:15 But that's hard as shit to do so I just keep it green. 
Coconut oil is high in fat so the cannabinoids bind to it better. Pure butter is the best tho, hands down. Just swap butter for oil, same measurements. I could talk about this literally all day lol

1446 2018-10-23 21:12:01 I believe what you are doing to track Iran oil delivery is crucial specially now that we have ghost tankers.
When it comes to actual monthly sales to different countries, things get tricky. But the purpose of sanctions is to cut Iran’s oil purchase/income, not its oil delivery!
1447 2018-10-23 21:11:47 @ShedrackFubara oil will continue flowing on your head,if it's their wages there will be no qualms but it's the common citizens and 30k is now too much
1448 2018-10-23 21:11:21 I had a friend forget to get an oil change for a whole year..
1449 2018-10-23 21:11:17 I just hate it when dem clippers lose that baby oil.
1450 2018-10-23 21:11:03 I’m mad af I got oil on my ugg’s def a sign
1451 2018-10-23 21:10:54 Oil & gas are 200 year old inventions. 

Name one other technology that has lasted 200 years without changing it.
Name one technology that has dominated the entire globe for 200 years.

ITS NOT AN ACCIDENT THEY DONT WANT BETTER ENERGY!
1452 2018-10-23 21:10:47 Do you mean that's not the usual way they are using to bring you to your Norwegian oil ring ? ;)

1455 2018-10-23 21:10:31 In 2006, Nancy Pelosi refused to issue oil permits. This caused $4 a gallon gas which triggered the global economic meltdown! Obamanomics only continued to feed the recession. In 1 year Trump reversed it!! More delusional Democrat/communism lies. Obama spent trillions for nothing
1456 2018-10-23 21:10:27 Probably, but coconut oil is actually deity endorsed!

1458 2018-10-23 21:10:18 @elrufai sir this is a free and vital intel
1459 2018-10-23 21:10:04 Don't you think their knowledge is where to find oil, how to get it out, refine it, etc.
Why do you value their opinion on agw so much? Because you like what they say. Desperately seeking consensus that's what this is. "even the oil companies agree" nope it's image building.

1461 2018-10-23 21:09:57 Hi Kristine!
Question for ya from a novice...Can you share with me the short version of what "hybridol cannabis oil"  would be?  Chronic pain here...Thanks much!
1462 2018-10-23 21:09:55 If the USA had stopped doing business with Saudi Arabia because of their human rights abuses, do we really think they would have kept it up?  Probably not.  We kept the oil flowing and turned a blind eye to 
their inhumanity...now we are here.  WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT THIS?
1463 2018-10-23 21:09:50 Lemme get this oil change before some fuck shit happens
1464 2018-10-23 21:09:40 Totoro lives! Might upload a little video of the first crank. Right now we have to fuel the tank, air the tires, then change the oil to make sure all is good.

1466 2018-10-23 21:09:24 You and your newfangled “oil.” You’re destroying the horse-drawn carriage industry! Breed more horses! #StuckInThePast
1467 2018-10-23 21:09:20 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
1468 2018-10-23 21:09:09 The US is about to go to war with Saudi Arabia. The US just revoked some visas of important Saudi people which means scarcity in oil and you don't do that to US.

1472 2018-10-23 21:08:24 I'm finding it all very confusing! I read that some companies use sustainable palm oil but don't state that in the ingredients. I can't find a list anywhere of which companies to avoid. Not easy trying to be a responsible consumer!
1473 2018-10-23 21:08:18 Olive &amp; almond oil are rich in essential fatty acids which help strengthen dry &amp; cracked nails
1474 2018-10-23 21:08:14 Recuping from another great journey to NY with four gilding classes in water, glass, and mordant/oil gilding methods. Saturday we do it again but right here in Seattle where we’re in the midst of Fall. Sitting in a  little ‘Paris’ cafe #lerreve #gilding #oilpainting #art
1475 2018-10-23 21:08:14 Welcome. I really wouldn't engage these people in debate.

If they think the scientists of the world are engaged in some elaborate hoax that extends to coordinating an UN report that summaries the *consensus* then I have some snake oil to sell them.
1476 2018-10-23 21:08:04 Senator the only thing you can do is block maturity of all bonds for next 5 years! And use profit from oil in VENEZUELA BUY CHEAP ;PUT A LARGE TAX ;THAN PROFITS IN 5 YEARS PAY OFF BONDS !ONLY WAY OUT OF THIS MESS!
1477 2018-10-23 21:08:01 You probably should have done this earlier so that people could see the actual effect on their lives. The way it stands now people will only hear the Scheer lunacy of the waaah-taxes-are-bad!!! crowd.

1481 2018-10-23 21:07:34 They are nice, reliable and easy to work with.  Just change oil & plug, clean filter and sharpen blade each year.  Keeps on ticking...the Timex of mowers...
1482 2018-10-23 21:07:21 This will make sense if the investment is in agriculture not oil!
1483 2018-10-23 21:07:21 Lmao they can murder whoever they want aslong as they have oil nobody will touch them

1489 2018-10-23 21:06:36 The main difference is that Gold is an element and not just a molecule like oil or a crystal like diamond. There is way more energy necessary.

Still the mine-able amount of gold on earth can increase by the described process, while the total amount is flat.

1494 2018-10-23 21:06:00 Your people are poor you have no human rights and your ruler is a murderer. The Royal Family has oil but that will soon run out and they know it.
Electric cars are here as well and aren’t going anywhere.
1495 2018-10-23 21:05:59 Have you tried the Jamaican black castor oil smoothie ?
1496 2018-10-23 21:05:52 Ironically its totally against America's financial interests to pick a fight with Saudi Arabia. They control the majority of the world's cheap oil, they can easily start sponsoring Wahhabi groups to attack Americans if they want to. Just another idiotic foreign policy decision
1497 2018-10-23 21:05:26 I now have 5% oil life in my car
1498 2018-10-23 21:05:14 This is coming from Saudi Arabia, whose main exports are oil and terror. Heck, they just committed and concealed their involvement in the death of #JamalKhashoggi
1499 2018-10-23 21:05:10 United really spent £75m on Lukaku who couldn’t hit a barn door, and £52m on Fred who can’t get a game, yet still moan about “City and their oil money”.

1503 2018-10-23 21:04:55 Well.. If this build in APi is the way going forward I am thinking of liquidating and forgetting about oil. I do think it is an adjustment from last week's draw and EIA will be more reasonable.

1508 2018-10-23 21:04:20 Neither have I, perhaps I should’ve clarified and said wind and solar. Maybe clean oil is the same as Trump’s’ clean coal

1514 2018-10-23 21:03:41 I hate being a woman. But I love peppermint oil. I’m tired of my body being terrible right now. I have so much I need to do. *lathers self in peppermint oil til I REEK of Christmas*
1515 2018-10-23 21:03:40 naw man it's super good, chili oil too
1516 2018-10-23 21:03:40 No they’re not. They just buy US weapons, pump a hell of a lot of oil and happen to be located close to Iran. Their values couldn’t be further from ours ... but, wait a minute... you don’t have any values ... I keep forgetting.
1517 2018-10-23 21:03:37 In July I was charged $195 for 5 bottles of your CBD Oil, I have not received the product nor have I received a refund. You failed to respond to my repeated emails and phone calls. Please resolve this issue with product or refund!
#americansciencecbd.org @americansciencecbd.org
1518 2018-10-23 21:03:31 9/11 is starting to make more sense as time moves on.  One source of income, oil, makes them desperate as fracking has stripped them of their world dominance.  These are not people you'd leave your kids with, that's for sure.
1519 2018-10-23 21:03:25 Why you getting an oil change? Lol
1520 2018-10-23 21:03:21 But Holyrood burns oil for electricity, what's worse Holyrood or all the old homes burning oil? I don't know.

1522 2018-10-23 21:03:15 pff. too much work.
tru fax: a basic Tokyo-style shoyu broth is just four ingredients plus water. Dashi + shoyu + salt/sugar + water. You can jazz it up with miso, mirin, chili, sesame oil. Boil your noodles in the stock for extra flavor, and now it's one pan and the same time!
1523 2018-10-23 21:02:57 Hey, unions represent people to! You guys get the car dealers, realtors and oil field companies that only have personal interests.... it all works out in the wash
1524 2018-10-23 21:02:56 Arguably the first “green” President and fought to break up standard oil, but he was too young to be apart of “the new deal” which I think has led the thinking of the last century.
1525 2018-10-23 21:02:55 Texas not having an income tax goes back to the days of big oil revenue.  Nowadays you should see our property tax. Ouch.
1526 2018-10-23 21:02:53 I was pumped when Shay said “babe I took your car to get your oil changed today” not so pumped when she said “I’m using your debit card to pay for it”
1527 2018-10-23 21:02:53 Is a christian who tells lies for the sake of political power really a christian?

Are the ones who cynically accept the lies as motivation to vote for a totally immoral snake oil salesman still christians?

Trump is an existential danger to christianity in general
1528 2018-10-23 21:02:45 It’s obvious that oil and gas are far cheaper than renewables, and yet this planet suffers to provide all of humanity with hot water and air conditioning, so before you want to be efficient and provide for all you want to move to address another issue. That doesn’t sound logical.
1529 2018-10-23 21:02:45 I dreamt I was a guitar

You were not delicate with your love
My strings snapped
All engineered.

1534 2018-10-23 21:02:08 OK. I tend to agree with you. I am very bullish on oil into Q1 but the drop today has been painful and shaken my confidence a bit. I do not believe the Saudis can pump 11m bpd much less 12m. Total overreaction but not much else to say.
1535 2018-10-23 21:02:04 He should put a huge tax on all remittances going back to their countries! They should use skunk oil to chase the caravan back! Or...buses lined up for Disneyland (wink wink) as they take them back home!

1540 2018-10-23 21:01:45 Yes I agree there was no need to kill the man he has the same right on this earth as anyone else a total disgrace but nothing will be done because they have oil which we should have as we saved the middle East from the Germans  the Saudis would now be speaking German RIGHT
1541 2018-10-23 21:01:42 Efficient markets is based on Pareto  improvement which in this case does not apply because: the major polluters are exempt (but not oil&gas) and it has to have a sum zero negative impact, which it also doesn't not.
1542 2018-10-23 21:01:34 I doubt anything significant will happen. Unless we and our allies heavily sanction Saudi oil, which seems unlikely given both the president's disdain for multilateral action, as well as the economic/political cost of higher oil prices near the midterms, I don't see this working
1543 2018-10-23 21:01:19 Venezuelan Govmt. uses laundered money obtained from gold mines, oil and drugs cartels to finance communist government and terrorism. They use PDVSA transportation to legally deal this drugs around the world, we all Venezuelan are aware of this situation.
1544 2018-10-23 21:01:08 Ask yourselves this...
Venezuela has the largest provable oil reserve in the world.
Why would they declare they're ready for war against the US?
1545 2018-10-23 21:01:03 They absolutely do get spent on political agendas. If they didn’t, conservatives would take no issue with the carbon tax and greens wouldn’t mind millions going to oil sands activism.
1546 2018-10-23 21:00:54 What if it doesn't go away for another 30-40 years? What happens when there's another BP or SoCalGas disaster? Just get mad again? There's a new technology to quickly stop the next disaster, but the oil & gas industries don't want to have to pay 'upstart outsiders' to use it!

1575 2018-10-23 20:57:59 The elevator idea will never work.

1578 2018-10-23 20:57:55 Same here, prefer a body oil like bio oil that I feel like it actually doing something for my skin.
1579 2018-10-23 20:57:41 Getting my oil changed is crazy annoying though
1580 2018-10-23 20:57:39 The gasoline oligopoly in this country has more control over gasoline prices than sand-filled oil that can't get refined enough to not fuck up car engines. Good thing we're about 20 years from internal combustion engines being a thing of the past.
1581 2018-10-23 20:57:30 I can’t see, hear or smell well and now my voice is gone. I need a full body repair. Do I get a free oil change with that?
1582 2018-10-23 20:57:26 Things I learned in Croatia:
- Emilia Clarke had a antique lounge sofa carried to the fortress of kliss
- the romans helmet Mohawks actually went sideways 
- Diocletian was a lil bitch
- CROATIAN OLIVE OIL IS SUPERIOR
- swords had spikes on the hilt to stab soldiers in the balls
1583 2018-10-23 20:57:15 Why is my mother asking me about cbd oil...? 
1584 2018-10-23 20:57:10 I honestly wish I would’ve went to the career center for auto tech. I still would’ve went to college, but I’d like to actually know something about cars besides changing a tire and checking the oil

1590 2018-10-23 20:56:47 Don’t believe this snake oil salesman. He’s run many of his own businesses into the ground and our country is next. Wait till you do your taxes in 2019.
1591 2018-10-23 20:56:42 Olive oil
1592 2018-10-23 20:56:41 There will be no quick China deal.  No quick Iran deal.  Shale oil is bleeding money and existing on the good graces of Junk Credit.  Opec is struggling to raise production.  
I suggest doing the math.

1597 2018-10-23 20:55:50 bread with olive oil is the new depression meal meta
1598 2018-10-23 20:55:41 They have to sell their oil. If it's cut off,Europe will have to bypass sanctions. I don't see that as a major problem except for US. We want oil transactions 2 b with US $
1599 2018-10-23 20:55:34 GDFCKN GRIEF. fox slobbermouths are saying "Oil took it's biggest hit in years; 4.22%." Well eat crap, OUR portfolio (& others), invested in American companies; is worth LESS TODAY THAN THE PORTFOLIO WAS WORTH IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR. Yes, the churning paper traders took 50-80%.
1600 2018-10-23 20:55:30 But, then, you'd probably have to work in oil and gas over on the West Slope, since the industry drives a lot of the economy, and that would suck for an enviro like you. Oh well. Best to stick to the Front Range where people will pay you to produce opinions. #copolitics
1601 2018-10-23 20:55:01 Ok so I went home last night and washed the bra that had all the wallflower oil scent on it. Gave it a sniff to see if it was gone and it only smelled like Gain. I was like sweet. 

Well now....
1602 2018-10-23 20:54:56 Do you use palm oil in any of your products?
1603 2018-10-23 20:54:55 Obama stymied growth in the oil and gas industry every chance he got. It has made an incredible comeback since Trump took over.
1604 2018-10-23 20:54:45 The $3bn deferred payment facility is a "rolling" line. What that means is you get $3bn of oil in year 1 that you need pay for in year 2. But in year 2 you get another $3bn of oil on deferred payment, so net impact is zero. Same in year 3. Then in year 4, you have to pay.

1609 2018-10-23 20:54:24 He has to be, they support the Republicans by getting lower oil prices for the midterms.
1610 2018-10-23 20:54:12 Wajid Sahab my understanding is those oil facilities were kept secret because of OPEC rules as well as IMF conditionalities. If Fund ignored on occasions it might have been due to US in need of our Army. Today we are friendless in Washington.

1612 2018-10-23 20:54:03 And that is why this is an act of terrorism. Because it is organized by somebody with money from Guatemala. Oil companies who are losing their play in Mexico is my guess. With flooding of immigrants you can abduct and destabilize your target goverment. War tactics my friend.
1613 2018-10-23 20:53:54 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
1614 2018-10-23 20:53:52 Oil field been calling me every other day

1617 2018-10-23 20:53:37 The make up remover pads I brought with me are the worst. So oily. Hard to rinse the oil off. Now my vision keeps blurring.
1618 2018-10-23 20:53:36 People are making the same mistake with assumptions on  Crude oil, as they have with assuming Tariffs wouldn't affect CAT earnings, 
 because they haven't seen the effects immediately. 
Crude is going way over $100,  unless policy changes. 
Either way, stocks are dirt cheap.

1623 2018-10-23 20:52:56 In other news, cabinet ministers were shocked to hear that citizens may need to drill for their own oil and water in the event of a #Brexit No Deal.
1624 2018-10-23 20:52:17 Let me guess... They have to produce a whole lot of oil to lower prices and help stimulate the US economy.
1625 2018-10-23 20:52:13 I thought it was funnier to write that than point out the massive environmental damage done by oil production and coal extraction, you massive cockwomble. I labelled you right there though, eh? Ha ha ha
1626 2018-10-23 20:52:09 Yep. People don't understand that all oil isn't the same. That's why people can be easily led to believe that tar sand oil can somehow have an effect on gasoline prices.
1627 2018-10-23 20:52:04 Taura hako iwe. The US wants the Venezuelan country to turn into a Somalia 2.0. It's inexplicable that with largest oil reserves they're in this situation. However, the corruption at the oil company was breathtaking.
1628 2018-10-23 20:51:57 It was also miscalculation on their part as well. Even thou that may supply most of our oil. It does not give them a free pass to murder a journalist
1629 2018-10-23 20:51:38 Just #woke Up on my BD brought my truck in for an oil change. Finally sat down & on @TheEllenShow little kid's #Halloween custom #Cake Of course Ellen pumped it up current to #cakebytheocean :) SWEET #MyBabe's taking me out2dinner. Cake by the ocean really sounds good:)

1632 2018-10-23 20:51:21 It's the conflicts of interest that concern me. Health, weopons, oil, finance....you name it they've got their fingers in it. Particularly Tories & Blairites I can't trust one bit.
1633 2018-10-23 20:51:10 Omggggg.... the colours!!!..... looks like an oil painting... that’s absolutely gorgeous.... fantastic pic, well done!! 
1634 2018-10-23 20:51:08 You need to heat crude to break it down. Which requires fire. Which requires LNG or.....you guessed it. Oil.
1635 2018-10-23 20:51:07 I had the octopus when I was stationed in Korea. Tasted like slimey sesame oil. It was wild seeing your food moving on the plate and feeling it suctioning your mouth though. Once was enough. Haha.

1642 2018-10-23 20:50:34 Oil Drops As Saudi Arabia Pledges More Supply
1643 2018-10-23 20:50:33 Hi Deborah, our natural gas rates decreased on Oct 1, 2018 and a typical customer's annual bill is less today than it was 10 years ago. It is also currently 57% less expensive than electricity & 70% less expensive than oil.
1644 2018-10-23 20:50:25 Let’s get this 
1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast
2-1/4 cups warm water (110° to 115°)
3 tablespoons sugar
1 tablespoon salt
2 tablespoons canola oil
6-1/4 to 6-3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1645 2018-10-23 20:50:25 Mfs put hella oil/moisturizer on their face then be talking about “that glow ”
1646 2018-10-23 20:50:19 But isn’t oil toxic to like, all life?
1647 2018-10-23 20:50:17 He needed too. Their oil is heavy crude. They need light crude to dilute it otherwise it fucks up their production equipment. Texas crude is light
1648 2018-10-23 20:50:12 STOP INGESTING CANOLA OIL!
1649 2018-10-23 20:50:08 Yes it does because gold like oil is created under certain conditions, permamnent conditions that allow their creation. Like diamonds for example they are creating by certain conditions and it is  apermamnent process not a finite one.
1650 2018-10-23 20:50:06 @RichardDawkins @carolynporco thank you both for the wonderful talk last night. Extra kudos for bringing your message to the "Texas of the North", where change will be slow due to lots of oil and beef jobs.
1651 2018-10-23 20:49:59 Well money talks honey. Even a rigid president such as donald trump cant resist saudi oil fields and cash flow
1652 2018-10-23 20:49:35 One aspect not noted is these people are being driven like cattle. 
The weak are left behind and likely become prey for criminal elements in Mexico.  
They are nothing more than political tools, any damage to them, loss of life is of no concern to organizers
1653 2018-10-23 20:49:14 Response from Broomfield to lawsuit “The City spent many months negotiating with Extraction Oil and Gas to include the most protective best management practices.”
1654 2018-10-23 20:49:11 Brother poured oil on his phone today and my mum was searching what to do online and she started reading out “season with salt and pepper, simmer on low heat then slice and serve” we are both CREASING
1655 2018-10-23 20:49:10 We challenge them to do it why not. These sesame seeds has no oil it’s only to sprinkle on  that’s is only use as it has no weight. If put strong fan it’s flying in the air.
1656 2018-10-23 20:49:08 オイル、君なら地球を救える。
1657 2018-10-23 20:49:03 Very practical, that's not going to stop millions of people from suffering in the short term as oil prices shoot way up and the world's financial markets crash. This is why I cant stand moralism/idealism in foreign policy. Carter-esque bullshit.

1662 2018-10-23 20:48:34 3 weeks ago I took my 2014 Mercedes CLA 250 for the 60,000 mile service to Euromotorcars in Germantown and they charged me $2000 dollars for oil change, transmission flush and new spark plugs. Less than a week later the car started acting up.
1663 2018-10-23 20:48:30 So it appears no tax on oil for heating but what about electric heat? Brrrrr
1664 2018-10-23 20:48:14 D ya mean lamp oil. If you know anyone who sells central heating oil they may be able to give you some
1665 2018-10-23 20:48:08 10 years ago musk had a brilliant idea and a very cost effective vehicle. The big 4 and oil companies tried to put him out business. As a result of their efforts he had to raise the price of his vehicles by 30,000 dollars. Blame big oil and the big 4 for driving up the prices.

1674 2018-10-23 20:46:33 I love how idjits claim it was over oil or GHWB had an evil globalist plan to take out the Middle East.

Then we all came home, left the oil, and didnt overthrow Saddam. 

They still screech the same nonsense today.

1689 2018-10-23 20:44:55 Just point out we will stop using diesel and petrol cars in 20-30 years, so oil price will drop, just as it gets more expensive to mine. Scotland isn't the only part of the UK with oil , a lot of the gas is in English waters we also have huge shale gas reserves
1690 2018-10-23 20:44:49 Wont happen...relax..KSA has bigger troubles than yemen this tym. Khasogi, Oil prices, Syria etc
1691 2018-10-23 20:44:44 I mostly agree but I would like to see a commitment from the real polluters before we agree to anything that hurts our global competitiveness.  China can sell widgets (or oil) cheaper than us because we have to follow rules they don't, while they cause way more pollution

1695 2018-10-23 20:44:24 Bottom line is we shouldn't be getting our oil there , we shouldn't be supporting such a country as Saudi and Brett is right what planet are you from ?
1696 2018-10-23 20:44:11 And your Select PM begging in front of Saidis for oil and Dollars. Begging Qatris for 1 lac jobs
1697 2018-10-23 20:44:03 If moving the oil was profitable, wouldn't railways do so on their own? Or if oil companies we're to make so much, wouldn't they finance or partner in the purchase?
1698 2018-10-23 20:44:00 So now your argument is that we should stop cutting down forests...something I agree with. This isn’t the same as shifting the global energy platform from oil and natural gas to sunlight, water, air and other renewable sources...
1699 2018-10-23 20:43:58 Holy shit, that’s like the distillation of patriarchy. Like, condensed into an essential oil. Wow.
1700 2018-10-23 20:43:51 80% of them r likely junk climate scientists, so they can fuck off 2 whichever country can afford 2 subsidise their snake oil indstry 4 another couple of yrs.

The other 20% probably r good& will go whrver they can live best: ie. once they get over their tantrum, theyll stay here
1701 2018-10-23 20:43:49 Arre. The comments are funny. There are men asking if hair oil can be used to grow beard

1713 2018-10-23 20:42:46 Good read .
I see,a so called "President", cornered, irrational & angered because of his personal relation with the SA ,personally & financially. 
Cutting ties with them , means losing 110 bill arms sale, any and all personal loans & more atrocious is what price for a oil barrel?
1714 2018-10-23 20:42:45 Without US Saudia will collapse instantly. You are paying and prostituting for US to stay alive. No dignity, no history , no faith.

1716 2018-10-23 20:42:44 So the caravan possibly connected to Venezuelan oil money, is headed to the US. Who basically owns Venezuela now? China does. I feel as though the Caravan is partly China’s answer to the US meddling with their one belt one road goal, a dream that Israel shares with China.
1717 2018-10-23 20:42:36 It’s not NIMBY. It’s unmapped oil & gas deposits under the school. It’s heavy Diesel engines spewing exhaust 15 feet from classrooms. An 800 foot walk defeats no purpose. It is not a done deal.

1733 2018-10-23 20:40:58 No we don’t! It is not about the payment! Sold oil is a purchased oil by a costumer (in return for money/goods/whatever to be paid at any agreed date). 
Stored oil is an oil without a specific costumer, stored somewhere waiting to be sold at some point in the future.

1756 2018-10-23 20:39:31 One thing I forgot to mention about the dream, there is a fluid in puddles around the streets. It isn't water or oil, not even hydrolic fluid. Not coarse enough. It's hard to tell the color but it very well could be blood.

1758 2018-10-23 20:39:21 There was no more oil in the house, nor were there any candles.（家にはもう油がなく、ろうそくもありませんでした。）
1759 2018-10-23 20:39:00 Instead of taxing working people, the Canadian government needs start making alternatives part of the law so we aren’t so dependent on fossil fuels.

Oh, wait, oil companies run the world, so just keep taxing us to death while nothing changes. Good job.

1764 2018-10-23 20:38:39 Get thee to the nearest Thai restaurant. It is AMAZING! Chicken stock base, LOTS of lemongrass, cilantro and other herbs, usually some veggies and shrimp or chicken. I am too wimpy to enjoy a lot of chili oil floating on top, but that's a very popular option.
1765 2018-10-23 20:38:39 I need to make sure I vote and get my oil changed this weekend
1766 2018-10-23 20:38:38 Apparently I can’t even go and get an oil change without some sexist comment. “Where’s your husband pretty lady?” I can handle a fucking oil change, asshole.

1768 2018-10-23 20:38:36 Allow me to retort. Kale is marvelous but home grown arugula is the bomb. My favorite thing right now is arugula, kale, & leaf lettuce mixed with carrots, sliced clementines, almonds & dressed with oil and balsamic vinegar. The kale is great but the arugula is fabulous.

1802 2018-10-23 20:35:41 I agree. This should have been done years ago. I suspect years ago imported oil was cheaper than domestic. Very short sighted.
1803 2018-10-23 20:35:36 coconut oil is not good long term!! I want to go in depth about it but thinking I may just write a blog post about it.

1830 2018-10-23 20:33:08 But it will change behavior. Less businesses means less employees traveling to work. Food prices too high no need to drive to grocery store as often. More people living on the street means less need for oil hence less emissions.

1845 2018-10-23 20:31:51 Juventus are just over rated
1846 2018-10-23 20:31:47 You are very simple. Again. The federal gov't approves projects...but the corporation who operates the facilty buys oil from the MARKET..which is international. Please stop being stupid.
1847 2018-10-23 20:31:41 Man getting my oil change so boring
1848 2018-10-23 20:31:33 Auto Accident w/Oil Spill: Austin Bouelvard at Saratoga Boulevard (Island Park). Use caution in the area.
1849 2018-10-23 20:31:24 Missed connection:

I wore a low cut shirt, gave you a boner and you still had to change the oil in my car.
1850 2018-10-23 20:31:24 Producing 4.5% of the world’s oil comes at a cost.
1851 2018-10-23 20:31:23 @RenaKARE11 I bet the reason the CBD oil Peter, from The Red Wagon, took didn't work is because it wasn't a H20 soluble oil. Since our bodies are mostly H2O- if you take one that's all oil, your body only absorbs up to 6%. I would be happy to talk to you on more info!!
1852 2018-10-23 20:31:21 @drvoice Any positions available in Sales Management in Oil and Gas Companies in Gulf?? Somebody is seriously willing to start a job there. Kindly forward some good place so I may forward the Candidate's Resume. Thanks Dear David.
1853 2018-10-23 20:31:17 Love black peoples that look out for they own. I just got a free oil change and servicing on my car  won’t he do ittt. I get to Keep my lil money
1854 2018-10-23 20:31:11 Tarriffs and current ICE enforcement practices hurting small farmers here in Western NY.  Higher oil prices and lack of migrant workers to pick produce.  Seeing fields of unpicked cabbages and butternut squash this week destroyed by hard freeze.
1855 2018-10-23 20:31:07 You know all those "team-building" courses where you have to build a raft out of 2 planks and 4 oil drums - it's got to cross the Channel.
1856 2018-10-23 20:31:05 High dollar and oil prices not a factor today?
1857 2018-10-23 20:31:03 also sorry for shitposting i got cbd oil so i feel like a normal person rn
1858 2018-10-23 20:31:00 Used Jamaican black castor oil on my hair today and every time I get a whiff of it I wanna throw up 
1859 2018-10-23 20:30:56 Not stealing.  Lying to taxpayers is stealing, but they haven’t lied.  Lies are taking tax payer money set for public schools and giving it to voucher programs. Taking public money and giving it to profitable oil industries.  Saying he didn’t cheat on his wife when he did.
1860 2018-10-23 20:30:46 Indomie Relish.... whoever it was that suggested using palm oil for the seasoning oil hehn haaa. The one with fish chunks is slightly better beht you see the other one hehn, afi bi ebo, na so so red

1864 2018-10-23 20:30:17 I went to get an oil change and tire rotation for my car and wow what a difference it makes. It drives so smooth. 
1865 2018-10-23 20:30:08 Ha "Most lame spin ever" is right. Sheesh.
Sad thing is UCP will probably win the next election and hand the province back to the Oil and gas lobby.
1866 2018-10-23 20:29:58 We get oil from Saudi Arabia which keeps them rich enough to spend millions on armaments & the west needs their business to bring in money & create jobs. So roll on electric cars which will cut down our need for oil & make us less dependant & them less rich
1867 2018-10-23 20:29:58 I got an essential oil diffuser yesterday and I already feel like my life is so much more together solely bc my entire room smells like lavender
1868 2018-10-23 20:29:48 Oh, thank you, darling. Let me see. Main polish is Sally Hansen w/ Argan oil Color Therapy in Plum Euphoria, Accent is Sally Hansen Complete Salon Manicure in Black and Blue. Lip color is Lipsense by SeneGence in Napa. Seriously long wear lipcolor.
1869 2018-10-23 20:29:48 This came into my feed thanks to a few people. As someone who deals with fellow influencers daily and handles pitches to work - first thing I do is check Sullygnome, my boy sully tells all. Stuff like this I feel is predatory behavior - and snake oil salesman tactics.
1870 2018-10-23 20:29:43 Yes everybody let’s all inject mercury, formaldehyde, aluminum, polysorbate 80, cell lines from aborted fetuses, tissue from hamsters, dog kidneys, dead bovine cells, monkeys, peanut oil adjuvants, etc. into our children! Yes that sounds like the safe solution people! xD
1871 2018-10-23 20:29:36 Saudi Arabia is brutal bloody facist state making abuse of our worlds precious oil supply, no time for appeasement, its regime should be destroyed like the Nazi regime. Oil should be freed to support humanity. Saudi assets should be frozen! #Washingtonpost #erdogan #brexit

1873 2018-10-23 20:29:28 The guys at Take 5 just all high fived me when they saw in their records how long it’s been since I started changing my own oil. (4.5 years, proud moment)
1874 2018-10-23 20:29:27 快眠じゃないですか〜〜！
1875 2018-10-23 20:29:26 zana oil hayss
1876 2018-10-23 20:29:25 We are not Tejas. We are Texas although if the illegal aliens continue to pour across the border in record numbers that could change. Beto is the LAST person Texas needs. Besides being an open border proponent he's anti everything Texas stands for-> anti 2nd amend, oil & gas....
1877 2018-10-23 20:29:17 India depends on coal, China & japan are sitting on massive oil fields in the South China Sea, the USA has invested in infrastructure for our new natural gas and oil finds. And again, every nation that signed the PA have had to reassess its pollution reduction promises.
1878 2018-10-23 20:29:11 Change to olive oil.  Much healthier.
1879 2018-10-23 20:29:02 When getting a oil change and they come out with a whole list of other shit 
1880 2018-10-23 20:28:47 Petroleum fucking stinksgas, oil, whatever.
1881 2018-10-23 20:28:25 @Lamiah4 Pls I need to get CBD oil

1885 2018-10-23 20:27:45 B-S: many have come out in favour, including oil companies and including a nobel prize winner for economics.
1886 2018-10-23 20:27:43 Oil changes aren’t fun
1887 2018-10-23 20:27:38 amigas me intrometendo pra dizer q sempre tenho a sensação q chego com a cara menos oleosa ao final do dia quando passo protetor (tem q comprar os q são oil free)
1888 2018-10-23 20:27:37 Part of oil mafia abroad laughing at Iranians
1889 2018-10-23 20:27:35 I seriously wanna learn how to change my own oil
1890 2018-10-23 20:27:32 People with shitty cars have nothing to lose when it comes to driving or parking. How you gonna put your trust in folks who front bumper hanging off their ‘08 Honda Accord with an oil leak?? They don’t care about shit.
1891 2018-10-23 20:27:22 Oil boom Economy of the 2000’s People had money to spend
1892 2018-10-23 20:27:09 so which essential oil figures out what I’m doing after graduation?
1893 2018-10-23 20:27:00 Thank you for the compliment- this oil painting is 30 x 24in/ 76 x 61cm
1894 2018-10-23 20:27:00 내가 무언니 고통받는거 보고 싶다니까 나더러 팔아파 한다 개웃겨ㅋㅋ
1895 2018-10-23 20:26:57 Suppose df/dW<0. Then you can trade some water for oil. This is just bad management. The same for df/dO. Therefore, in equilibrium, every firm will be in a region of its production function with non-negative marginal changes for each input.
1896 2018-10-23 20:26:51 Former business exec worked for firm implicated in Oil-For-Food corruption scandal-says she had no knowledge of a company subsidiary that was implicated in a kickback scheme with the Saddam Hussein regime.

1897 2018-10-23 20:26:41 Trudeau didn't have a problem throwing taxpayers under the bus when it came to purchasing a pipeline for billions to appease the oil industry, but when dealing with an actual murderous regime and selling them actual weapons killing actual people, it's an issue.
1898 2018-10-23 20:26:40 some lady just asked me what was wrong with me face... because i’ve been breaking out real bad from working with oil and shit.. yep my confidence fucking dropped tenfold and i feel 1000 x more ugly than i already am.. what the fuck..
1899 2018-10-23 20:26:33 I DECREE OIL ON YOUR HEAD,SPEED ON YOUR LEGS AND MONEY IN YOUR POCKET.
1900 2018-10-23 20:26:28 Obviously, this nut has not weened off oil and gas. There is a study about plastic getting into brain.
1901 2018-10-23 20:26:15 Carl makes a living on the most gullible voters. His daily propaganda is designed to weaken confidence in elected officials. To whose benefit? Oil companies, conservative billionaires, and DC Republicrooks. THOSE are the powers he would have voters trust. What a scam artist.
1902 2018-10-23 20:26:13 So instead illegal migration continued with migrants and honest businesses bearing the most cost.  Now it has morphed to free benefits too & still no party will come up w a real solution.  They are not all going back and not everyone can come.  People need to get off high horses.
1903 2018-10-23 20:26:05 I mean, Chavez definitely used the country's oil wealth to raise the standard of living of Venezuelans. The problem is Venezuela and then Maduro both completely mismanaged Venezuela's economy. When oil market collapsed, it exposed that mismanagement.
1904 2018-10-23 20:25:58 I WOULD GET MY CAR BACK AFTER AND OIL CHANGE AND THERE BE 5 MF BEES IN MY CAR. THEN ONE HITCHHIKED WITH ME TO THE WEST SIDE BECAUSE ITS RETARDED ASS IS TRYING TO GET OUT MT BACK WINDSHIELD. rant over.
1905 2018-10-23 20:25:57 Buy an electric vehicle and stop paying for gas and oil changes- so old school. Recharge for $8 per 500 km at the many charging stations. It is a beautiful thing! Check them out. Imagine save gas fill ups/weekly- what would you save?
1906 2018-10-23 20:25:27 Let's talk about players who actually shouldn't be playing...

Mastic. Wants to give his all but dude turns like a WWII tank lacking oil and seems to take 5 touches before passing.
#MUNJUV
1907 2018-10-23 20:25:25 nonoo we can't do that... you know it will hurts @pinkrodeo88  ... i don't want a fight with here... hmmm only in oil :P lol haha
1908 2018-10-23 20:25:20 I hate that. it's like a weird pinching feeling for me. try CBD oil if you van get your hands on it! works wonders. praying for you dear 
1909 2018-10-23 20:25:15 The difference starts in our definition of export. As long as the definition is clear! 
Export for us is sold oil, not delivery from point A 2 B. If the unsold oil in storages in China depletes in Dec & some goes to SK, is this Iran export to SK in Dec or export to China in Sep?
1910 2018-10-23 20:25:04 Let D=f(O,W) be your firms production function making D units of dressing with O units of oil and W units of water. The choice of interest is dO/dW, should you change some oil for water. Obviously

dO/dW=df/dW / df/dO
1911 2018-10-23 20:25:02 Also like having your car insurance pay for oil changes, washes and tune ups. Oh and there's nothing in the Bill Of Rights declaring health insurance as a right. I blame the unions of the old days for fucking that up.
1912 2018-10-23 20:25:01 Seems low mileage for the head gasket to go. Need to carry out head gasket test to confirm plus pressure test. If oil cap has white gunk that could just be condensation. Need to be diagnosed and looked at properly to be 100% sure seen a lot of head gasket diagnosed incorrectly
1913 2018-10-23 20:24:54 fawk i need an oil change asap
1914 2018-10-23 20:24:40 The oil industry gets too many subsidies as it is
1915 2018-10-23 20:24:28 I felt then, since it was obvi that migrant labor was here to stay, that bush could have created a migrant worker program that would have made it worth it to be legal instead of illegal.  But he passed the chance and the right was too hard headed.
1916 2018-10-23 20:24:26 When you rubbing the booty with oil and your fingers move like you playing the piano
1917 2018-10-23 20:24:15 Get this right. The government does NOT buy oil. From anywhere. Not 1 drop.
1918 2018-10-23 20:24:15 You don’t know my partisanship. If Trudeau had approved energy east, we could be using Canadian oil. Then Irving oil would be able to buy our oil and not Saudi oil. Very simple.
1919 2018-10-23 20:23:58 None of them, that’s the point. My friend Eduardo made $300,000 betting oil futures one summer and Eduardo won’t come close to getting in. The ability to make money doesn’t impress anybody around here.
1920 2018-10-23 20:23:44 Be glad you're not playing with our group.
We would probably drench our horses in flammable oil, set them ablaze and kick them into the cave...again...
1921 2018-10-23 20:23:38 If a man Only Eats Fish Oil CapsulesAnd does Not Drink Leek Juice though.
1922 2018-10-23 20:23:36 Outside money?  Like Saudi oil money and Clib for Growth?
1923 2018-10-23 20:23:36 Like a guy with an F rating from the Better Business Bureau knows what God has planned.  I’m fairly certain God doesn’t want the masses shafted by a shill of a snake oil salesman
1924 2018-10-23 20:23:29 Try Coconut oil
1925 2018-10-23 20:23:22 1/2 Trafigura - formed from a split group of Marc Rich companies a well known sanctions buster i.e deals for SA Apartheid, Iranian oil . Was on the Top - Ten most wanted fugitives by USA. Trafigura is a copy and paste of Marc Rich @MthuliNcube @acielumumba @OpenParlyZw @matigary
1926 2018-10-23 20:23:21 With allocation from oil?
1927 2018-10-23 20:23:17 Alternate these homemade, easy #facials. Body scrubs.#organic
1. Activated coconut shell derived charcoal, baking soda, coconut oil.
(This is a messy one. May want to clean off with paper towels.)
2. Coarse, unrefined sugar, lemon and/or lime juice (extra glycolic acid optional).
1928 2018-10-23 20:23:14 I’m not surprised. Basically businesses were incentivized to use illegal labor since they could cut cost.  In construction being honest meant losing work - a lot, depending on the trades.  I didn’t blame the migrants then; all I knew were working to help family.
1929 2018-10-23 20:23:11 Wasn’t that Bush that had a thirst for oil? I don’t think 45 has the same tastebuds.
1930 2018-10-23 20:23:08 so ready to get home to oil my scalp.. the bun got my head burning 
1931 2018-10-23 20:23:00 A valid question... Some changes in his tenure:
- Transition between NASL and USL
- Coach Rennie (and subsequent roster rebuild)
- Move to Lucas Oil Stadium
- Hiring of @masonzbt 
I guess it depends on your perspective on whether those are accomplishments or not.

1935 2018-10-23 20:22:20 Lucas Oil Raceway or whatever they are calling it this week in Indy is the track to go to.  That way you can go to the museum at the Brickyard and not have to suffer through that god awful racing at IMS
1936 2018-10-23 20:22:19 Lol@the amount times i forget to get an oil change 
1937 2018-10-23 20:22:15 LMFAOOO! Girl, I knew how to check it but I never did. When I tell you my engine didn’t have oil in it for over a year and the shit didn’t die in me until 2 yrs later.. that’s a Honda for you! 
1938 2018-10-23 20:22:13 Pls, I need to talk to you about the CBD oil..  This is my line 08082900191or better still you can mail me at muhasaheed2@gmail.com or drop your number and I will call. Thanks

1940 2018-10-23 20:22:11 Meanwhile at 'Davos in the Desert' business as usual:

"Oil giant Saudi Aramco said it signed 15 memoranda of understandings worth $34bn (£26bn). The company said these entities were from eight countries, including the *US*, Japan, China, India and the UAE."
1941 2018-10-23 20:22:11 Shoe leather and patience are the key to good human intel. Thank you for your efforts. I'm putting in for a field promotion from Big Oil for you!
1942 2018-10-23 20:22:08 Or, a failure to report donations from large corporations from the likes of Agri-Giant Monsanto, or Oil and Gas Titan: Sinclair Companies. But yeah lets focus on a one time donation from the Coeur d’Alene Tribe.

1944 2018-10-23 20:22:01 You guys kill me - still peddling the deregulation snake oil. 

Hilarious! 

There are a variety of cures for your country’s health care woes. Pick any of Canada, UK, France, Germany, Sweden, Norway - well I’m sure you get the idea. I expect @SenSanders could also help.
1945 2018-10-23 20:22:00 it's like any horoscope or tarrot card reading. it helps for intersection and can help you self fulfil but I wouldn't rely on winning the lottery based on anything in it. she also does Evil Eye readings/cleanses with holy water and olive oil. I honestly believe they work.
1946 2018-10-23 20:21:49 Well,  for me it's like,  keeping the wheels spinning.

Even when I have a cold , I try to job ,walk or move as much as possible so my body doesnt shut down.  So exercising when I'm sick is kinda like oil. 
Helps me get better faster
1947 2018-10-23 20:21:47 I also need to find a way to proclaim the war on terrorism was really just for oil.
1948 2018-10-23 20:21:40 NO SURPRISE , MONEY & OIL TALKS.
1949 2018-10-23 20:21:31 Saudi FOREX injection = $3 billion
Oil Soft Payment = $9 billion (3yrs)
Gwadar oil refinery = $8 billion
Investment in CPEC = ?

=====

Total: $20 billion

Good innings by the Prime Minister.
1950 2018-10-23 20:21:31 Scoring slump? Next game vs the oil?? That's the magic formula. Goal tonight for Sid. #thewayshegoes

1958 2018-10-23 20:21:10 Check out @PnPCBC to hear Richard Masson discuss Canada’s reliance on Saudi oil at 4:30 p.m. MT this afternoon.
1959 2018-10-23 20:21:08 Water in the oil, plugs look like they have water etc, etc.
1960 2018-10-23 20:21:06 Market may react possitive to KSA bailout package, but today's fall in oil price can make its impact on index heavy weights like POL, OGDC, PPL and MARI. #TheNews @TribuneBiz #Pakistan #stockstowatch #StockAlert
1961 2018-10-23 20:20:38 Switch to a Tesla3 and pay $0 for gas. Especially ideal if electricity source to charge ($8 per 500 km) comes from hydro, nuclear or other green energy forms. No need for oil changes either- we love it!
1962 2018-10-23 20:20:29 The Govt of Canada doesn’t buy any Saudi oil. But Sheer knows this, right?
1963 2018-10-23 20:20:20 Is the coffee at jiffy lube oil or coffee
1964 2018-10-23 20:20:19 Yes but won't help US billionaire lobbyists and their sub standard crap food exports and dirty oil & coal
1965 2018-10-23 20:20:18 Yes sir . This is another good development because Yar'Adua/Jonathan made it 18k from where it was now Buhari is trying to make it 30k despite the low price of Crude Oil in market. Atleast we are to pray for more to come not CASTIGATING sir
1966 2018-10-23 20:20:13 Saudi Arabia is brutal bloody facist state making abuse of our worlds precious oil supply, no time for appeasement, its regime should be destroyed like the Nazi regime. Oil should be freed to support humanity. Saudi assets should be frozen! #Washingtonpost #nieuwsuur
1967 2018-10-23 20:20:01 O’Wow, sorry to know that. Too many meds for a problem that has no cure. Thank God I have my Cannabis THC Oil Card. It helps a lot as long as it kept in your system consistently. #CannabisAdvocate
1968 2018-10-23 20:19:59 50% reduction of oil import would be better of course! I agree. What would u suggest as reduction in 12 years?
1969 2018-10-23 20:19:57 Does it really matter? The spaceship is blowing up and u are worried about changing the oil
1970 2018-10-23 20:19:31 Then why didn’t we take over those oil fields? We turn back to their people. Quit thinking of us as the bad guys. I served valiantly in the military and I did it to try and stop oppression and terrorist from rape and murder.

1973 2018-10-23 20:19:17 Maybe it's magic to you Dana bc all you do is write hit pieces trying to take down Tesla. While folks like me have been focused on record growth, engaged customers who LOVE the products, and the potential Tesla has to do good in the world and get us off OIL!

1979 2018-10-23 20:18:40 I have this ep on DVD.  The sex scene with Linda Evans cannot be un-seen and traumatised my cats.  My husband is still looking for the right support group.  To this day, when I see a bottle of baby oil next to a half a six pack of beer I burst into tears.
1980 2018-10-23 20:17:52 We should stop all trade with this lot and so should the USA but they won't because of the oil.
1981 2018-10-23 20:17:49 The LPC wants to slow the economy, when will people realize this.
And they want to make the oil industry a state run venture thinking it will pay for everyone's drama- teacher and humanity studies degrees.
1982 2018-10-23 20:17:44 The evidence is there all in your face the intelligence is there but yet president  Trump believe Saudi prince. It’s obvious he’s pandering for the oil money.
1983 2018-10-23 20:17:36 Yet in your profile pic, you have straws and plastic lids on cups. Product of oil. Be an example and stop using oil products.

1993 2018-10-23 20:16:13 Yes the sector is just pulling back and hopefully will be much higher in 2019 if oil cooperates.

2017 2018-10-23 20:12:59 For the second time Saudi Arabia has supported Pakistan in avoiding IMF loan. This is a very good news for the country as oil is also gushing at back of this support. This will also shut criticism Khan is facing from the united opposition.

2019 2018-10-23 20:12:53 May I add:1/Low level of engine oil,needs top up. 2/Low viscosity of engine oil(due to various reason) needs oil replacement. In India with ambient temp crossing 45deg C,operator needs to be extra vigilant for margin of error is that much lower.Delay can result in engine seizure.

2023 2018-10-23 20:12:19 A six year old “promise” has to have some flex. There is a direct correlation between oil prices and electricity prices. Oil prices, whilst off their recent highs are more than double their low of circa US$35/barrel - that’s Brent. I got 33% off electricity bill
2024 2018-10-23 20:12:10 Hmmmmm looks like we're in a gulf and completely outside my comfort zone. Is that an oil rig? I see a river on the bottom left with multiple bridges. #DamOrNot

2028 2018-10-23 20:11:49 Why is oil bad for the environment? (before we change it for own use) It come from the earth, the earth is a living organism, so why does it harm it. When a snake or spider gets venom on themselves, it doesn't harm them.

2044 2018-10-23 20:10:38 Germany.  I also have read that clear cutting for palm oil production is a real big problem.

2050 2018-10-23 20:10:09 Well it's like this: We pay nothing this year and then 2018's $3b oil bill in 2019, 2019's bill in 2020 and so on for 3 years in total. So we can say that basically we'll pay this years $3b bill after 3 years.
2051 2018-10-23 20:10:05 Ive done a cbd bath and also got cbd gummies. They worked fine but i also wasnt in much pain to begin with. Im considering getting an oil to try that. But i also hate knowing i have to mask pain.

2058 2018-10-23 20:09:52 When I was 23 I was working on an oil rig. I spent a lot of time in the derricks 300ft or so off the ground for 12 to 18 hours at a time. The question I’m asked mostboften about that time isn’t “ how’d you handle the blistering cold or the sting rain?”
2059 2018-10-23 20:09:52 So they burn oil to refine oil?  How much of the energy a refinery uses to refine oil is electricity and how much is oil?
2060 2018-10-23 20:09:38 You simply do not understand economics. How can a country that sends £64b to Westminster (not including oil revenues) and gets £30 back be responsible for any debt?

2066 2018-10-23 20:08:53 Current infrastructure (pipelines) ar more than adequate to supply the demand for that usage of oil. The expansion of the TransMountain pipeline is about INCREASING Tarsands production by 40% or more.
2067 2018-10-23 20:08:52 Ingredients- apple, carrot, ginger, pumpkin, pineapple, coriander, banana chips (bananas, coconut oil, raw cane sugar). Have I just made it WORSE?!

Votre politique est bien élaborée, je vous remercie de l'effort.
2101 2018-10-23 20:05:49 Actually, the oil sands have made great headway in cutting emissions, in part thanks to AB carbon-tax revenues.

2105 2018-10-23 20:05:19 I don’t understand why cars need an oil change so often like wtf dis is tew much betch
2106 2018-10-23 20:05:17 Seriously? You think the price of oil matters? What is at stake here?  Or are you simply in denial and can’t face the truth?  Because it’s happening. It’s also accelerating due to unexpected feedback loops  that scientists didn’t anticipate. They admit to being terrified.
2107 2018-10-23 20:05:05 What cuticle oil do you used?
2108 2018-10-23 20:05:01 Forget oil and gas; the future of energy belongs to lithium. Saudi will „The end“ in coming years
2109 2018-10-23 20:04:58 Bro, try and go through Nigerian economic/ political history.  Checkout other countries who equally rely on oil. It surprising 2 think PMB brought this hardship. Read bro, read! PMB, has his own mistakes definitely,  but If you knew how the country has been managed, 4get.
2110 2018-10-23 20:04:49 Yeah normal food dye doesnt work for cheese. You need oil soluble dye like annatto. And good luck on the corn flakes
2111 2018-10-23 20:04:43 If by some miracle these tweets and/or your new found fake concern for the oil & gas business get you re-elected, we all know you'll knife us and the oil & gas people in the guts the day after the election.

So, no thank you please.

Don't be like Hillary, just go away.
2112 2018-10-23 20:04:34 People say they will vote for R’s because they like the way things are going, that the stock market is good, etc...
NOPE. WRONG! Volatility, trade wars, tariff wars, deficit concerns, interest rates, oil market worries, world instability:
Investors this year will end flat.
Losses
2113 2018-10-23 20:04:25 And yet his Impreza went through more oil and petrol
2114 2018-10-23 20:04:23 Too much money and oil at stake. It's appalling, easier for them to turn a blind eye
2115 2018-10-23 20:04:21 So on November 5th the gas discount stops. Can we leave the Saudi people alone before they get mad and stop provided oil to us? That guy wasn't American. Look at him, look at his name. Leave the Saudis alone! I don't like paying $4 for gas. @realDonaldTrump #SaudiArabia

2119 2018-10-23 20:03:59 Well sir, I see that you don’t care for STANDARDS at your establishment. I have eaten a few of these, and have already coated them in my immune-boosting essential rose oil which wards of vaccinated children, so I’ll just keep them and leave. Good day!
2120 2018-10-23 20:03:51 Planning on changing the oil this weekend then

2123 2018-10-23 20:03:43 I was today years old when I realized that olive oil has calories??? 

Shocked and frankly a little upset.
2124 2018-10-23 20:03:41 Pls explain something to me. I have a Harley, made in the USA. There’s a label on it that says “proudly union made”. How come all the HD riders in the US are republicans?! Union and Republicans are like oil and water?
2125 2018-10-23 20:03:41 Within 10 years the West will not require their oil as electric cars will be mainstream and the West will be able to use their own oil for ships etc.
2126 2018-10-23 20:03:37 Thanks God I don’t have that many degrees like US General& then Secretary of State Collin Powell who sat in the UN and lied to The Whole world while cia tenet was sitting behind him. Millions of innocent people r killed &still suffering. Any thought about Iraqi oil where is going

2130 2018-10-23 20:03:11 Yet we continue to buy $2B of foreign oil every day, much of it Saudi oil.
2131 2018-10-23 20:03:00 I'm looking at energy systems over geographic regions (Costa Rica's is entirely self contained and self owned) while every other nation depends on Saudi blood oil, or fracked earthquake oil. You're over there lost in irrelevant paperwork, pedantically talking down to me. Sad.

2133 2018-10-23 20:02:45 Canada doesn’t import oil, companies like Irving do! But if you think the pipeline had a better chance to be built before we bought that asset. You are mistaken sir. Everybody likes to be outraged but not everybody likes to face the facts.

2146 2018-10-23 20:01:55 Tbh it was just brownie mix and weed butter instead of oil. I definitely died and came back to life last night and am planning on making legit stuff from scratch in the future I was just too high last night to put in real effort lol

2149 2018-10-23 20:01:45 @realDonaldTrump We have 2 situation: assassinations on Turkish Consulate are something normal, Saudi Arabia want embargo on its oil for higher Aramco capitalization. Sure is that information detained by Khashoggi about Saudi Royals are know by someone else. Find that person.

2151 2018-10-23 20:01:09 This is probably true. You would have knowledge of this idea, as you spent the last 5 years as premier being the oil industry’s messenger to the people of SK and not the other way around
2152 2018-10-23 20:01:05 I see our faithful brother Marko,standing in the gap for us & for so many others .Thanking God @GraceandMercyMi for your unwavering faith, compassion, solidarity.

2155 2018-10-23 20:00:54 To bad carbon tax does nothing but push business to countries with no carbon tax.  And does nothing for your fears.   Carbon footprint of Saudi oil u love so much is worse than a pipeline.

2163 2018-10-23 20:00:23 The price of gas in Toronto will fall a cent at midnight tonight and could drop another 3 cents first thing Thursday, according to @RogerMcKnight. That would bring the average down to 118.9. It’s all tied to the price of oil which has fallen dramatically. 
2164 2018-10-23 20:00:22 Why would anyone block a turnip? What can a turnip say that hasn't been said by a carrot, an oil slick, a stale leftover or beautiful red hot? Beets me.

the clinic I work at we have been testing patients who claim to only be using CBD oil and lab work is showing 70% of the time it is coming back hot for THC...70% a lot of it is due to the lack of restrictions that are placed on making and selling it

2178 2018-10-23 19:58:50 Do you buy fuel to propel your vehicle? Then most of the highway funds are collected right there. If you didn’t buy fuel, how would you get around? Do you bitch about the cost of oil when you buy tires? They get U down the road too. Any idea how much processed oil is in ea. tire?
2179 2018-10-23 19:58:44 IDK. The mkt doesn't want + oil $, as it works against their book (growth stocks). Might lead to mkt cognitive dissonance, where attention is paid to supportive narratives, while those opposing are faded. Oil price has defied "lower 4 longer", but belief remains, obviously.

2184 2018-10-23 19:58:16 My mom being the resourceful eco friendly Mexican woman that she is used the leftover oil from frying chiles for marinating the chicken. 

My mouth is on fire! It’s like someone put invisible chili flakes all over my chicken. 
2185 2018-10-23 19:58:13 How much in carbon tax are you charging all the oil you are importing? Zero.
Don't lie to kids.
2186 2018-10-23 19:58:08 I’m afraid we don’t have time. That’s the problem. We used it up listening to the BS that oil companies spent millions on - to cause us to doubt the #ClimateCrisis was happening, even though their own research showed them in the 80s. We wasted 40 years. Times up.

What else wd u hv expected more from @ImranKhanPTI so far?
2189 2018-10-23 19:57:47 We need to find an alternative to oil right now!!
2190 2018-10-23 19:57:40 Agree, but having worked in the ERP side of manufacturing- Varco Oil Tools - there is still variance, even when we installed pick-and-place robots and automated machines tool feeding systems.

2200 2018-10-23 19:56:46 Diffusing lavender oil just to keep relaxed.
2201 2018-10-23 19:56:41 It's not redistributing what anyone at the top has for them to pay a more relative rate for their impact. You do realize oil spill cleanup is written off as a tax deduction right? Is there a pollution tax either? Is it relative to the damage caused?

2211 2018-10-23 19:55:57 1. It’s possible to cancel a contract, if there’s ethical reason to do so they can argue the cost of canceling.  2. My point isnt that they should cancel but they are hypocritical threatening cancelation but continuing to hinder Canadian oil, in doing so support dictators

2216 2018-10-23 19:55:07 It’s a big win for the new PM of Pakistan though. They are close to being bankrupt. Oil greases the gears

2221 2018-10-23 19:54:38 It's not oil for us through this strait. Oil tankers are only a portion of the ships that go through. It affects trade w/Asia & Europe. Want terrorists controlling that? Demanding extortion? Or worse yet, possibly hijacking & blowing the ships up?

2233 2018-10-23 19:53:41 You see Nic how your are clueless here .. Saudi Arabia can make more money by cutting its oil production and the prices will jump between 120-150 $ a barrel .. and that shows you are one hell of a loser in all ur arguments against Saudi Arabia ..
2234 2018-10-23 19:53:37 I really just want my baby oil back 
2235 2018-10-23 19:53:37 Not sure why you are resisting this when so many economists and even oil companies have done the math and demonstrated over and over again that is a good policy move to transition the economy. The extreme events in your riding will be far more expensive for taxpayers.
2236 2018-10-23 19:53:34 Adderall? More like peppermint oil
2237 2018-10-23 19:53:18 Are you speaking as an oil company advisor or an ex premier, or is it the same thing?
2238 2018-10-23 19:53:15 Oil too? How do you even collect it? #HopeWithZola
2239 2018-10-23 19:53:08 Didn’t answer a single question from Sales. Just repeated his mantra of lies like a snake oil salesman.

2247 2018-10-23 19:52:30 Why not build a million barrel a day refinery in AB or at least big enough to equal our gasoline consumption daily?  Why isn’t this being discussed?  Don’t get it.  We get screwed on the oil, screwed on the gasoline.  Maybe we just like getting screwed.
2248 2018-10-23 19:52:12 Weren't accurate or where taken out of context?  They explained where they got the figures from, nnpc, the fact that other govt regulatory bodies in the oil and gas sector had different figures just buttresses the point.

2252 2018-10-23 19:51:46 Contains cannabis oil I think?
2253 2018-10-23 19:51:45 The political pandering and overly exaggerated outrage over questioning the narratives are very similar.

If I ask a question about physics, I get an explanation about physics. If I ask a question about climate change I get called names.

Yet EVERYONE still uses oil hydrocarbons.
2254 2018-10-23 19:51:45 Defdered oil payment is essentially a loan of $3 billion for 3 years. Can't count it as $9b.
2255 2018-10-23 19:51:37 By covering the weald with a solar farm stretching 30 acres with plastic and silicon  would cover the energy gained from one well producing free flowing oil from a 12-24 inch inch pipe. There is no fracking at HH.

2267 2018-10-23 19:50:57 As someone with a kitchen and a really rudimentary understanding of fluid physics, let me just say that coconut oil at these brisk autumn temperatures is not the sex lube they’re looking for.
2268 2018-10-23 19:50:54 Our southern border is the USA where we already ship most of our oil at a major discount....not exactly tide water now is it?

2283 2018-10-23 19:49:36 I don't know "olive oil" might be a bit too foreign for them. Probably just pick up some medicine instead.
2284 2018-10-23 19:49:31 Waiting for 2 hours for an oil change with a dead phone was not the move 
2285 2018-10-23 19:49:31 Oil will still reach you
2286 2018-10-23 19:49:20 The US could anihilate the entire Middle East ( Israel exempted) in a matter of weeks/ maybe one month.  Yet we always try to be the good guys. Sometimes I think we should go in, take all their oil, and throw them back to the sand, - with camels. - not Lamborghinis..

He exploits their fears, prejudices and biases like a snake oil salesman selling a miracle cure in a bottle to an audience or a con man with a bunch of marks. Just keep speaking the truth.
2291 2018-10-23 19:48:28 @KlasraRauf , Not $3Bn but $6Bn. Saudi Arab is giving Oil worth $3Bn on credit, in addition to the $3Bn for Current Account.

2301 2018-10-23 19:47:34 Saudi Arabia is brutal bloody facist state making abuse of our worlds precious oil supply, no time for appeasement, its regime should be destroyed like the Nazi regime. Oil should be freed to support humanity. Saudi assets should be frozen! #Kashoggi #Khashoggimurder

Good innings by the Prime Minister.
2306 2018-10-23 19:47:02 Who is calculating this amount? How much Oil do we use per year.... Is it just 3B $ or more?
2307 2018-10-23 19:47:01 254 units each averaging 3kg per day of plastic, micro plastic, cigarette butts, food wrappers, bottles, polystyrene, oil and much more.
2308 2018-10-23 19:47:01 i went and got my oil changed today and after it was done (took almost a whole hour btw), the man came out and said do you know your traction control light is on? well jeez bob i’ve had the car for almost 4 years of course i’ve seen it i’m a just a girl not blind.

2323 2018-10-23 19:45:09 Think it will be a case of trying both on the various pieces as you might find they come up totally different, so would be a nightmare to do it all either with wax or oil and find you have 3 different colour finishes. (but then, what do I know;)
2324 2018-10-23 19:45:06 Um, because we aren't part of OPEC, and Saudi Arabia is. Oil is now a global commodity & it isn't so simple anymore.
2325 2018-10-23 19:45:03 -do not brush your hair when it’s wet

c) didn’t - suck things up
No surprise if he turns out to be a massive hypocrite too
2340 2018-10-23 19:43:50 as long as possible (8+ hours), do not let it boil at ALL, keep it on warm and in the morning or whatever strain all the mmj out and you have dragon oil. 
I just eat a chunk of it with some food n I'm good to go. Using mmj your oil should be amazing. DM me if ya need me!
2341 2018-10-23 19:43:47 Import oil to eastern Canada?
Buy a fully funded pipeline and not build it?
Oh wait. That's already been done.
2342 2018-10-23 19:43:45 Uh... the emissions and pollution created by shipping raw crude internationally and importing refined gas products is huge. Exporting oil while importing fuel is in no way good for the planet...

2348 2018-10-23 19:42:57 China is often ahead of the curve these days. 

They have very quietly sunk large$ int2 oil production in2 north African states, expanded land mass in the Spratley islands near the phillipines claiming ownership, & lots of trade deals wherever.

It seems Israel is on the list.
2349 2018-10-23 19:42:53 No it’s the worst car company. Recently purchased Creta in May 2018 from Allahabad dealer which came with faulty body paint, exhausted battery and damaged oil seal. To top it all company is not responding to our complaint. Contemplating to sue it’s CEO Mr YK Koo

2361 2018-10-23 19:41:55 Dragon oil is just simple handmade cbd oil. Way stronger. Take you an oz of mmj, grind it up and stick it on a baking sheet. Bake at 220, 20 mins. Take a cup of coconut oil and melt it on warm in a crock pot. In a cheesecloth or pantyhose, add the baked herb. Let that sit for...

Now that Saudis have agreed to produce more oil, expect Iran Sanctions to go forward as planned.

And Saudis paid $100 million to SDF in Syria.
2369 2018-10-23 19:41:13 Don't worry. He's still going to buy our oil from Saudi......what a walking joke.
2370 2018-10-23 19:41:08 But it’s not a bailout package. All we’re really getting is deferred payment on oil imports. $3bn is really just going to sit in our current account for a year, which cannot be used. It’s a means to stabilize the rupee. I sincerely hope that we do something on our too.

2377 2018-10-23 19:40:22 For sure the Saudis are crashing oil today to make Trump happy.
2378 2018-10-23 19:40:10 Not many seem to bring up that fact - OIL
2379 2018-10-23 19:40:10 知ってる？大学って大して重要じゃないんだよ。焦ってる暇あったら油、飲も？
2380 2018-10-23 19:39:56 Have the oil company stop the leak and clean up the mess. Then they can deal with all the lawsuits. It's on them, deal with it.
2381 2018-10-23 19:39:31 John Carpenter's Halloween is like an oil painting. RZ's is like a finger painting. I like both. And really like the new one too.
2382 2018-10-23 19:39:31 okay. placed my order for like 5 western rose sample oils. now i'm super excited because i been putting on lotion and getting dressed to some ol sexy flexy songs and i can't imagine how imma act putting on some oil LOL
2383 2018-10-23 19:39:26 He is an apologist of the Kingdom, not entirely a bad objective to have when money is such a low hanging fruit in the royal house of Saud. Trump's first international visit was to Saudi Arabia. He paints a vivid oil based picture of DC-Riyadh quid pro quo relationships & excesses
2384 2018-10-23 19:39:24 Saudi Arabia is brutal bloody facist state making abuse of our worlds precious oil supply, no time for appeasement, its regime should be destroyed like the Nazi regime. Oil should be freed to support humanity. Saudi assets should be frozen! #FII2018
2385 2018-10-23 19:39:17 It has been reported that Lindell, CEO of MyPillow, is a convicted felon & a long time snake oil salesman.
2386 2018-10-23 19:39:17 $AMRN Doesn't care what the market is doing, we got fish oil to sell!
2387 2018-10-23 19:39:11 This is very important, because a friend of mine has told me for 10 years: US and Russia will fight at the Pan arabian isle which party gets the oil fields. Well, it is not far away. Even Turkey will invade the holy land....
2388 2018-10-23 19:39:09 El #crude oil  experimentó un brusco retroceso al perforar el soporte de los 68,5 dólares.
Es probable que se dirija a los 64
2389 2018-10-23 19:38:46 So, we're getting oil on deferred payment?
2390 2018-10-23 19:38:39 Oil
2391 2018-10-23 19:38:23 Put Oregano oil in tea! It gets rid of sore throats right away & good for colds overall! Feel better Bugz 
2392 2018-10-23 19:38:20 Yes well where is the charity coming from the hearts of all the billionaires that have profited from oil and gas extraction? Why are they so rich while u have to struggle?
2393 2018-10-23 19:38:12 Excuse me??? He profits off of others. He's a slick snake oil salesman.
2394 2018-10-23 19:37:56 Democracy Deomcracy Democracy-
I mean unless you give us oil

Unless you buy billions in weapons from us
Who falla for this sanctimonious b's from the West? Not Eritrea
2395 2018-10-23 19:37:56 Well Done PM Imran Khan! Oil import of $3 billion worth on deferred payment for three years from Saudi Arabia and additional USD 3 billion to be parked in the Pakistan's National Treasury for 1 year by KSA. This will provide breathing space for sure

2397 2018-10-23 19:37:45 California makes lots of olive oil, and it's not adulterated. And most of it is not expensive.
2398 2018-10-23 19:37:45 It’s not a 6 billion life line. Where did you get this information? It’s 3 B USD for current account deficit, and 3 B USD for deferred payments for oil. From what you have written, we will not need the IMF prog. or help from other countries. Don’t misquote.
2399 2018-10-23 19:37:37 Scotland has loads of gas and oil we don't need tae ruin the country wi fracking
2400 2018-10-23 19:37:36 It's a move for them to come for the oil. It's all a big plan to take #SaudiArabia oil. That's how they operate nxt thing #France and #USA will be booming the poor country eish. The #UN will send them
2401 2018-10-23 19:37:35 are you going to stop allowing US coal to pollute Canada on its way to markets while preventing Alberta oil from reaching new markets? #cdnpoli @RachelNotley @JustinTrudeau #whywait

2403 2018-10-23 19:37:31 Lrt in my med class we did an experiment with this oil that showed all the bacteria on our hands with a black light and we had to go to the restrooms to wash all of the bacteria off. I had to wash my hands a total of 7 times because the soap at my school is very diluted

2405 2018-10-23 19:37:28 Thank you Val. Would love to know. Right now I take medical CBD oil. I’ve heard of dragon cannabis before.
2406 2018-10-23 19:37:24 That’s Hong Kong btw, not Scotland.  That one’s cold and full of oil rig tenders, not awesome.
2407 2018-10-23 19:37:14 Une autre chose doit être dite : le prix des carburants ne cesse de monter. Malheur aux plus pauvres. Ceux qui ont une voiture au gas oil subissent déjà une décote de 15% , ce n'est pas avec 1000 € de plus (prime) qu'ils vont pouvoir se payer une voiture électrique à 30 000 €
2408 2018-10-23 19:37:11 FUN FACTS: 

Current Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin got his "business" start with George Soros when they started a Hedge Fund together. 

Soros funds Josh Fox anti-fracking films and profits off of KXL through his investments in Canadian Tar Sands Oil monopolies.
2409 2018-10-23 19:37:09 I am currently getting an oil change at Wal-Mart. This lady hasn't stopped talking. Considering running for my life.
2410 2018-10-23 19:37:04 Sad I ruined one of my fav pair of vans by accidentally spilling a gallon of oil inside
2411 2018-10-23 19:36:58 That’s what makes this country great but if you’re an oil rich nation that’s been getting away with murder (literally) human rights offences for years.
2412 2018-10-23 19:36:50 There are over 40 million in Honduras,Guatemala,Nicaragua, El Salvador.
If these people have the right, then so do the rest. Is the first one in line any more/less deserving than number 32,475,768 ? 
A valid question.

2416 2018-10-23 19:36:09 I had steamed kale that I slightly stir fried with garlic, grape seed oil, and some sun dried tomatoes with a big side of steamed sweet potatoes. I also made myself a cup of dark hot chocolate with molasses. I took my Chinese herbs and I’m lit

2419 2018-10-23 19:35:53 Should we take fish oil pills at this young age ?
2420 2018-10-23 19:35:51 THIS GIRL ON FREE AND FOR SALE REALLY SAID “ITALIAN IS JUST MAYO WITH OLIVE OIL “ HAHHAHAHA

2425 2018-10-23 19:34:43 Shales oil production is increasing,  but nobody really care about the significant truth on their inadequate facilities. There isn’t enough export infrastructure like ports to handle those volumes. Even pipelines are at bottleneck.
Shales oil at the kink curve of not being cheap.
2426 2018-10-23 19:34:32 @jimcramer jim , why do you call out 2:45, 3:30 as critical market times that the rally needs to make it through? Does it have to do with oil closing at 2:30? Looking to understand ... thxs
2427 2018-10-23 19:34:31 Too much olive oil in the gears
2428 2018-10-23 19:34:30 When my tax dollars go to build roads, highways and bridges, does that help or hurt your oil and gas industry?

2431 2018-10-23 19:34:21 One TV channel - you know which one - was debating for several hours that PM Khan did a disastrous speech at the Investors Conference (FII) & frightened the Saudis, then came the news tht Saudi Arabia has created a bail out pkg of $9 billion plus MOUS on Oil Refinery
2432 2018-10-23 19:34:19 I made rose oil instead of rose water and put it on my face and bruh
2433 2018-10-23 19:34:16 @ImranKhanPTI :Finally your sincere effort paid of by bringing in $3billion from Saudis!! You did it for poor Pakistanis!! And am hopefully if you make the same effort other oil rich countries will contribute!! Now that you got some space to breath freely and going forward step
2434 2018-10-23 19:34:01 Hi. I'm in recovery and also not allowed to take opiates and something that's helped me greatly is homemade cbd oil. It's just dragon oil but it saves my life. I have a great recipe I'm more than happy to share, it is so easy. Good luck, friend.
2435 2018-10-23 19:33:52 I grew up with girls who slathered themselves in baby oil for sunbathing. And yes, the skin cancer is starting to appear.

2437 2018-10-23 19:33:37 Get realistic , it’s going to be hard to heat your home with the increased cost in NG . Or maybe you use just electricity for heat .... oh wait solar .... hmm need oil for that you must use wood .... umm wait carbon there too . What’s a treehugger to do ???
2438 2018-10-23 19:33:29 Maybe only several dozen? 
How many wanted criminals in the bunch, only a couple hundred? 
The proportion is irrelevant, 1 is too many, distracts from fundamental issue they are econ refugees, they say so, and have no inherent right to come.

2441 2018-10-23 19:33:23 The admission is just part of the sales pitch. Like a used car salesman who admits the car needs an oil change.
2442 2018-10-23 19:33:23 There is a very close bond between the Saudi Royals and the U.S. We helped the Al Saud's unite the tribes, the people and form Saudi Arabia, we worked with them for decades building their infrastructure, especially in oil. They have shown more support towards us than the EU.
2443 2018-10-23 19:33:12 You realize Trump DIRECTLY affected the entire solar industry in America right? He defends oil and coal. Doesn't give a fly fuck about the climate. But go ahead and talk about a bunch of nonsense that not really provable and try to slander Bernie for other peoples problems

2452 2018-10-23 19:32:01 Look up oil cleansing and seed cycling. It’s done wonders for me when the dr said I had to take a pill. I found a naturopath who has changed my life!!
2453 2018-10-23 19:31:54 The claim is that real olive oil doesn't need dark glass, since it's low in PUFA.
2454 2018-10-23 19:31:54 Someone bought nice hand soap for the staff bathrooms.

I used the nice hand soap for the staff bathrooms.

Then my hands tingled.

Then I realized the nice hand soap was basil oil.  

So now I need my own nice hand soap for the bathrooms.
2455 2018-10-23 19:31:54 It is no coincidence that the party of divisiveness is also the party of nationalism. Put planet before nation. There is no longer a choice; the planet is not big enough for oil companies. Once a few oil companies are out of business, we can revisit party ideology.

2459 2018-10-23 19:31:36 Republicans are greedy by nature. The best way to explain wind and solar power to them is in terms of cost. Wind and solar are free - they are literally in the atmosphere. Oil has to be dug out of the ground and burned so it has to cost more.
2460 2018-10-23 19:31:34 Im so Glad You decided You want a war Yengeni! Now I suggest you anounce it more publicaly. A good Idea would be towards the Botswana border so our US Marine friends can oil our weapons and Ammo!! See You soon in opposite trenches!!
2461 2018-10-23 19:31:31 Eric, crude oil was off over $3 today. On the back of flagging Chinese economic news, South Korean bellweather indicies are bearish, etc.  Those policies were set in motion in April/May.
2462 2018-10-23 19:31:28 There are 2 competing views in oil ATM, which have created these wild $ swings.  All parties agree supply is extremely tight, but bears believe demand destruction will render this moot, while bulls believe demand will hold steady, & normal outages will create $ spikes. TWT #oott

Awesome, @ShepNewsTeam .
2473 2018-10-23 19:30:29 it's just apt that when @mikiebarb is covering Saudi-Arabia's brutal oil-funded regime, the Daily episode is sponsored by @exxonmobil, country's largest oil exporter. #irony
2474 2018-10-23 19:30:22 Oil?
2475 2018-10-23 19:30:20 I’ve always preferred oil based chili suspensions (xo type, “angry grandma” etc). Sambal +/- dries shrimp paste also stellar.
2476 2018-10-23 19:30:19 Let’s teach our daughters how to put oil, windshield washer fluid & antifreeze in their car, how air up their own tires, properly clean their car, jumpstart their car, the basics so when they’re doing it some stranger doesn’t feel the need to say “do you know what you’re doing?”
2477 2018-10-23 19:30:19 Les ferries et les paquebots l'utilisent aussi mais, en Manche et en Mer du Nord,ils sont obligés d'avoir des nettoyeurs de fumées ou de marcher au gas oil, beaucoup plus cher. Pas encore en méditerranée ce qui explique que les ehpad flottants des croisiéristes polluent autant
2478 2018-10-23 19:30:18 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
2479 2018-10-23 19:30:17 Do you not bloody understand! Their money is entwined I the UK economy, in the global oil business, property, power supplies, they can do what they want and we will shout and scream. But they still know our safe word! Cash!
2480 2018-10-23 19:30:12 You are failing in your mission as Secretary - "to protect America's landscapes". You sell off public lands for oil profits, ignore the clear science on climate change, fire the person in charge of the 14(!) investigations against you, and misuse public funds. Please resign.

2487 2018-10-23 19:29:36 Seems odd that #US and #Saudi funded "foundations" would wage a campaign that would severely limit the ability of a resource that could have the effect of moderating the world price of oil to get to full production....

2497 2018-10-23 19:28:15 There’s no evidence. There’s no explicit agreement written down. The agreement is this: we give you $5 billion and invest in oil if you agree to switch off the petrodollar and fund these migration organizations.
2498 2018-10-23 19:28:13 True. I’m allergic to peanuts and have had allergic reactions to Italian olive oil twice. I stick to local New Zealand ev oil. As good as you can get in the world!
2499 2018-10-23 19:28:13 Gym oil change , then get Alayah’s costume ready in that order 
2500 2018-10-23 19:28:11 Females get a car and don't check the oil, tire pressure, or coolant. As long as a MF start up and radio work she ready to roll
2501 2018-10-23 19:28:11 Hi just saying proposition 112 is miraculously a bipartisan “NO” statewide  it’s so so so so important to get out and vote no on this issue for oil & gas!
2502 2018-10-23 19:28:05 If you don’t get spots, organic avocado oil is a fab moisturiser!
2503 2018-10-23 19:28:01 If you think DJT can be reduced to some “reality tv garbage” just because you want to believe in fairy tales, then more fool you.

WTF was Obama before becoming POTUS? F all. A no-name, former pot smoking community organiser snake oil agitator who was groomed & pushed by Soros
2504 2018-10-23 19:27:55 No, this idea hasn't been true for many years. The Saudis can't increase the price of oil all without withholding from the market, and they can no longer afford to do that.
2505 2018-10-23 19:27:44 Where in this city sells CBD oil #Winnipeg
2506 2018-10-23 19:27:36 My co worker just asked if you think it’s safe to snort BHB oil powder...I think we’ve reached peak LA in the office today
2507 2018-10-23 19:27:33 That question is right up there with the answer to the Theory of Everything.
2508 2018-10-23 19:27:32 Put some oil. 
2509 2018-10-23 19:27:30 Why oh why do you give a good god-damn about Saudi internal affairs???  Stopping trade, goods embargo, diplomatic retaliation, oil embargo, etc. etc. etc. Whatever crime was perpetrated is none of Canadians's business. Are there no home grown problems? GROWN get it????
2510 2018-10-23 19:27:28 Exited my #crude #oil short today. Entered $CL_F puts on 10/4 around 75.04.
2511 2018-10-23 19:27:26 Y’all really on my head about this oil light thing, maybe y’all forgot a young man is half blind 
2512 2018-10-23 19:27:20 OiL
2513 2018-10-23 19:27:20 That’s a step backwards Sly.  We need to be moving away from oil and gas.  The US used to be a technological innovator.  That doesn’t seem to be as important to you anymore.

2515 2018-10-23 19:26:59 I'm sorry but he has been voted in as presdent fair and square more than once; the people believe in him and want him; they don't want big oil back in charge.
2516 2018-10-23 19:26:53 I Got My Momma Oil Changed & Gave Ha Some Money To Get Some To Eat .. 
2517 2018-10-23 19:26:51 Interesting Questions: 1. What substance(s) were formed from slowly heating the canola oil over time? 2. If the substance forming the new non-stick coating on the pan is a plastic, will adding canola oil at room temperature cause blending or bonding with or to the coating?
2518 2018-10-23 19:26:47 I've tried it, and it has the peppery taste in the throat of 100% olive oil. Plus I trust the guys who run the company.
2519 2018-10-23 19:26:45 ::was at check-out::

::goes back to place order for this oil::
2520 2018-10-23 19:26:42 Next should be bread and Red oil 

Let’s understand where the ailment leads 
2521 2018-10-23 19:26:39 @officialcbismo I live in ontario and ordered some oils from the OCS, like most of their customers though I have no idea if they'll ever process the order, let alone ship it. My question is simple: Can I buy oil's, pills ect from your site legally as an Ontario citizen?
2522 2018-10-23 19:26:38 The Nordic countries were so awesome prosperous that's why we have such huge swaths of people of Nordic ancestry in the US. Norway was hard living until they found oil in the 50s.

2524 2018-10-23 19:26:34 Is all murder disrespectful to Fearless Leader or just the ones committed by oil rich countries that make the news?#PantsOnFire
2525 2018-10-23 19:26:26 Supporting oil is support for an inferior product, that gets us tied up in these ethical issues with the middle east.  Oil is no longer worth the headache, or cost.  The future is green, and people like the Koch brothers are shooting their beneficiaries in the foot.
2526 2018-10-23 19:26:10 @nytimes your links in app are messed up. Example: today’s editorial “DT is Lyin’ Up a Storm” links to “A Tranquil Oasis in Greece.” And “An 85% Chance You Say” links to “Here’s What Oil Drilling Looks Like” Help?!
2527 2018-10-23 19:25:53 All I want is a boyfriend who will take my car to get its oil changes so I don’t have to deal with it

2529 2018-10-23 19:25:39 Does anyone on here use oil cleanser to remove their makeup and if so what kind??? Idk where to start
2530 2018-10-23 19:25:37 Why pay? Because it would show a small desire to win. They'll never pay like the Yankees, Red Sox or Dodgers, which is fine, but  what isn't fine is not paying. I would rather they pay too much for a bad contract every once in a while on the chance that they strike oil
2531 2018-10-23 19:25:29 Got a oil leak & need 2 new sensors
2532 2018-10-23 19:25:25 no es solo OIL, hoy el mercado pasó de -2 a flat...
2533 2018-10-23 19:25:24 Crop dusters filled with skunk oil 
2534 2018-10-23 19:25:11 Oil. If we're supporting the intervention over oil,that should stop. We have oil here. Others nations sell oil. If we'd quit feuding w Russia,they have oil.
2535 2018-10-23 19:25:06 We anticipate gas will go up about 1¢, diesel will go up about 1¢, and heating oil will go up about 1¢ in January 2019. Cap and trade will not likely cause these prices to change much more over the first four years.

2548 2018-10-23 19:24:16 @nytimes Do snowbirds realize that Florida is having a water crisis? When they vote, are they considering that DeSantis has a "F" voting record on water and voted against clean water and environment 162 times. He takes Oil/Koch money.
2549 2018-10-23 19:24:15 Trump and Common Sense.
That's Like Oil and Water.
2550 2018-10-23 19:24:02 Plus, with comics these days, you have to wear white gloves to keep the oil from your fingers off the pages....
2551 2018-10-23 19:24:00 New warmer for the living room.  I love how well it matches my diffuser! My hubby and I love the smell of sage, I managed to snag a couple bottles of Sage Essential Oil off the flash sale too!  Guess what my house is smelling like?
2552 2018-10-23 19:23:58 Beard oil coin 
2553 2018-10-23 19:23:49 EeuuuOlive oil?
2554 2018-10-23 19:23:36 Yes. Islam still follows the same tactic...with the blessings of western powers who'd not call it out...for the sake of oil.
2555 2018-10-23 19:23:32 i just can't even.........
does he wonder will happen when the oil dries up?
2556 2018-10-23 19:23:12 Compared to the other oil stocks we had a good day.

Off a quarter penny and the spread.

Some of the others are down silly percentages. Days like this show which stocks have relative strength.
2557 2018-10-23 19:23:12 @Sephora needs to make/sell Halloween makeup kits. Hate that cheap oil stuff. #halloween #sephora #makeup
2558 2018-10-23 19:22:59 I think I’m gonna bring in a vile of essential oil to huff at my work desk y’all I Am Stressed
2559 2018-10-23 19:22:38 There’s enough for everyone. Gov. Just doesn’t want you to know that. Thus, bringing me to my next point. That we will never run out of oil and the expenses are unnecessary
2560 2018-10-23 19:22:33 @Abukar_Arman: "Well, of course. #Somalia’s politicians are ready for more loans and dodgy deals such as Soma Oil and Gas, whose former Executive Director for Africa is the country’s current prime minister. Never mind the glaring conflict of interests."

Never dare speak of this.

2562 2018-10-23 19:22:22 Petroleum. Leftist Europe and other countries kowtow to the oil. 50 of the countries are Muslim. Majority opinion doesn’t mean ppl are right. Once everyone believed in a geocentric universe. They were wrong, weren’t they? Do more research. Israel is humane. Don’t fall for lies.
2563 2018-10-23 19:22:19 Somehow I just don’t believe him. 
Wonder if China is buying Venezuela oil because of Iran sanctions, giving Venezuela $ to spend on Honduran “caravan” ? 
Then again. Will Iranian oil go to China through Venezuela?
2564 2018-10-23 19:22:18 Diversion by the administration, why is gas and oil prices higher than two years? Why are interest rates climbing? But let’s tak about a few thousand people a few thousand miles away and on foot. Hey let’s call in spacefore
2565 2018-10-23 19:21:50 Oil company must clean this up
2566 2018-10-23 19:21:42 Diesel can actually run on old chippie oil, I believe.
2567 2018-10-23 19:21:30 I figured as much. We’re a sea salt and coconut oil popcorn bunch so haven’t tried it. Sorry.
2568 2018-10-23 19:21:25 Thank you! Top tips: use rapeseed oil as it can take a higher temp, stir fry on and high heat say for 8 mins, keep moving the okra, then add a splash of water, turn down the heat to low, cover and let steam for 3 mins. Salt at the end! Bingo!
2569 2018-10-23 19:21:18 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil. My cup runs over. Surely goodness and loving kindness shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

2572 2018-10-23 19:21:12 It would've been, had I fried it in some oil first.
... but I didn't, as I'm trying to be good w/ my diet these days
2573 2018-10-23 19:21:06 Here’s an idea. Just pour oil into the ocean. It floats so it will follow the currents to a destination and then they can siphon off the oil. No pipes, no ships, it’s brilliant. (I’m kidding, don’t tell Dump, he’ll do it.)
2574 2018-10-23 19:20:54 I read about the vitamin E oil . With my skin being so sensitive and oily i wonder will it work 
2575 2018-10-23 19:20:48 Called it. This is where I load up on $crc again into earnings and watch oil go back to 83-85 right around earnings juicing the pop. Load up
2576 2018-10-23 19:20:32 No coincidence that  1st oil barge “Alexander” was operated in #Caspian  in 1873.  1st tanker – “Zoroaster” (1878) was voyaging to #Caspian  . 1st internal combustion engine“Vandal” (1903) and 1st 2 reversible motor “Delo” (1908) ships were fortuned to #Caspian sailors.

2580 2018-10-23 19:19:55 Trump is also twisting their arm to bring down the oil prices by increasing production
2581 2018-10-23 19:19:54 There are a lot of food rules I live by, but over time, they grow and change and become nuanced. Only two have remained unchanged:

1.) Oil has no speed limit in the digestive system.

2.) Capsacin doesn't digest, and leaves as hot as it goes in.
2582 2018-10-23 19:19:52 My car really costs $80-$100 for an oil change. Would’ve just copped a Benz if I knew this prior lmao tf

2585 2018-10-23 19:19:40 Would not it be better to #refine #oil in #Alberta before #exporting it?
2586 2018-10-23 19:19:37 I hate it when you go to get an oil change and then find out your car is about to blow up.... again. :-(
2587 2018-10-23 19:19:32 I bought oil today, then realized my car doesn’t need it so I turned that notification off all by myself. Then I went to the gas station, got gas and checked my tire pressure. I don’t need a man fym....

Til my car starts making a weird sound then I’ll call my dad.
2588 2018-10-23 19:19:29 Which essential oil tells me who’s mad at me

2. Cook or steam your broccoli abt 300-400g
3. Put basil, one clove of garlic, olive oil, salt, pepper, grilled pine nuts, Parmesan or nutritional yeast in a blender 
I eat this almost daily so hope you love it xoxo
2590 2018-10-23 19:19:26 While I firmly believe that behavioral change at grassroot level is important for climate action, please don't let these oil companies gaslight you. Antarctica is not melting cause you printed that email or failed to switch to energy saving lights.
2591 2018-10-23 19:19:17 I slept til 9:30am, made chili in the crock pot, washed dishes, got the oil changed and all I want to do is sleep again.  Is this what Mom life is all about? All I want to do is sleep, sleep, sleep.

2602 2018-10-23 19:18:21 Seems anything to hurt Canada is priority #1.

How about hurting the Saudis by stopping importation of their oil and using our own natural resources instead.
2603 2018-10-23 19:18:17 If I were President... (sung in the voice of Olive Oil) all voting would be mail-in and paper ballots for in-person voting, also automatic registration upon graduation and would do away with the fucked electoral voting system. Can I count on your vote in my fictitious run?

2608 2018-10-23 19:18:00 We have multiple NWO according to the region and situation. Hit at the right time. Deferred oil payment was expected but materialised only after IK visit. 
Silence of Iran on #Khashoggi is quite meaningful
2609 2018-10-23 19:17:48 Those who would give up essential Animation, to purchase a little temporary Papaya, deserve neither Parlor nor Chili oil.

`i tell ya if this doesnt come good...then ..well.
Positive and great interview. wow....its getting bigger
2612 2018-10-23 19:17:38 Surely we can all agree though that if Florida ever made massive oil discoveries that would be very bad indeed
2613 2018-10-23 19:17:36 Yes the stealing oil. I've not seen convincing evidence for that take. From what I can tell the lie originates with Michael Moore's widely discredited Farenheit 9/11.
2614 2018-10-23 19:17:35 Water infrastructure conference, IIRC. That means allowing offshore oil drilling and polluting the Pacific Ocean.

2 cans of tuna in water, drained.  Add a tin of anchovies and like half the olive oil, and whatever else you like, mayo, relish, red onion, sriracha.  But try it with anchovies!!!!
2617 2018-10-23 19:17:06 It's Really disgusting . I hate the fact that it doesn't seem to get much media coverage in the west . I have to go to external sources an brave journalist for it. Especially what happening in Yemen. Just coz the west love der oil.

2619 2018-10-23 19:17:05 It’s always going to be flawed when you’re automatically against Alberta oil..
Other oil from other countries, and coal BC ships elsewhere is not bad for the environment, only Alberta pipe expansion...
What a crock...

. 9 Billion Dollars as Oil on Deferred Payments

Khan Plus KSA Won The Show So Far
2622 2018-10-23 19:16:48 Nope they're just very old memes. That is a v good name for your snake oil peddler
2623 2018-10-23 19:16:47 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, however the media to begin asking questions on their behalf.
2624 2018-10-23 19:16:38 I understand the premise, but with #TheFed finally raising interest rates, the bubble economy set to explode like never before, Federal spending continuing to rise, and the #Saudis threatening to take oil to $400 a barrel it is a dumbass move.
2625 2018-10-23 19:16:38 Massaging oil into your own hair/scalp gives you a killer shoulder workout
2626 2018-10-23 19:16:32 Okay, I think I figured it out. They wanted to make a profit of $1 per wing, but that’s a $1 profit AFTER a combined 11.25% sales tax and restaurant tax, AND after the operating costs (oil, electricity) of making the wings...
2627 2018-10-23 19:16:27 Same as claiming Bill Clinton had a surplus with around 5 billion in fed public debt. 
A true balance sheet, assets vs liabilities tells a different story.
 If I had balloon payment, but didnt pay on it along the way, huge surplus. What happens on due date?

2631 2018-10-23 19:16:06 Never said we were just oil and gas, however even the SNP growth commission accepted that Scotland would face austerity plus for a number of years post Indy. Re Labour, I completely disagree with their position on Brexit
2632 2018-10-23 19:15:45 180 For A Oil Change Yeah Never Again 
2633 2018-10-23 19:15:40 America has its own oil now so shut up about phuket oil
2634 2018-10-23 19:15:29 If we dedicated ourselves to clean energy we wouldn't have to sacrifice what it is to truly be American for some oil, from the very people we are fighting all over the middle east.
2635 2018-10-23 19:15:19 yeah like Norway's SWF and all these liberal universities/pensions getting out of oil gas coal investments at literally the dead bottom in 2015. how dumb will that look 10-15 years from now ... $USO $BP $XOM
2636 2018-10-23 19:15:16 So apparently you can't just put garlic paste in very hot oil?
2637 2018-10-23 19:15:16 Being a grown up, real-life Little Marie from Rocky does not attract quality people.  Unless you want to be huddling around a fire in an oil drum on some street corner in Philly with like-minded bums, straighten up, because you sound ridiculous.
2638 2018-10-23 19:15:14 Talent & Oil are usually rare! But never get arrogance and oil mixed up! Trust me you’ll be able to tell!
2639 2018-10-23 19:15:12 Yeah....a landlocked country would have all kinds of oil and gas access routes.....
2640 2018-10-23 19:15:08 Should it not be total cost of ownership back to present value?  Oil changes are not needed and brake pads much more infrequently (due to regenerative braking) on EV versus ICE so should be included.
2641 2018-10-23 19:14:59 Sanctions against Arab Kingdom could spark increase Iran Oil price, destabilizing middle east !
2642 2018-10-23 19:14:45 Tough guy, Mike Pence.  As soon as someone tells him how much oil they sell us for our gas guzzlers, and how they're a counterweight to dreaded Iran, and how many co-Republicans r tied 2 them, he'll cave 4 sure.  Nice sound bite, though, 4 Dense Pence's dense & angry white fans.
2643 2018-10-23 19:14:41 All the fine guys work the oil field, with cattle or electric 
2644 2018-10-23 19:14:39 I love how my skin looks and feels after I put my shea butter & coconut oil on  & I used to really have the nerve to not put nothing on after the shower smh.
2645 2018-10-23 19:14:37 Since you want the US to be dependent on foreign oil, why don't YOU move to Saudi Arabia?
2646 2018-10-23 19:14:27 It’s strange that no one questions why the same people/foundations/media — Munk/#AureaFoundation et al. — that were behind: Levant’s “ethical oil”/the lawsuit to dismantle our medicare system/etc. & are financed by dirty Barrick Gold $ are behind the promo of the carbon price.
2647 2018-10-23 19:14:15 Right now I’m using miss Jessie’s pillow soft curls, cantu curling cream, & coconut oil for shine 
2648 2018-10-23 19:14:13 2. Add to this PETA's stinking hypocrisy over fur and leather. They promote synthetics, which are mostly petroleum products. The oil industry is responsible for the death of a lot of small animals and for pollution. There is no such thing as "cruelty-free" petroleum products..

2651 2018-10-23 19:14:01 Make a drink of 2 oz olive oil, 1oz of fish sauce and Tabasco. After 30 mins the affected area will turn red if broken.
2652 2018-10-23 19:13:47 Some countries buy on very generous payment terms. What would you like us to do with those? Should we move them to January or until sanctions are over? Greece and India were very late last time.

When oil moves from A to B, that’s an export.

2655 2018-10-23 19:13:40 Money is the prime factor - whether in the form of oil or sales of armaments. Influence appears not to have worked on a medieval tyrannical state which murders dissenters. I have heard no Senior Officer claim 'Values & Standards' can be amended to accomodate 'influence'.
2656 2018-10-23 19:13:25 How can Obama think it is his economy?  
Trump repealed all his policies & did the opposite: Tax reform, deregulation, new trade deals, oil independence, jobs/business Obama said gone forever, business friendly environ., consumer confidence, etc.  Obama is embarrassing to watch!
2657 2018-10-23 19:13:23 Could lead to shortages of your favourite imported jam, or wheetabox, imported electronics, unhealthy canola oil or even tea! On the flip side, would encourage local industry and using the plentiful  for cooking oil.
2658 2018-10-23 19:13:14 Put some mink oil on that bag!
2659 2018-10-23 19:13:08 So we should sacrifice our American values, to Muslim Extremists and a Sharia law country for some oil and some checks that supply the home of Bin Laden with weapons and jets?
2660 2018-10-23 19:13:00 I love coconut oil. Has such a lovely silky feeling. Leaving your skin feeling smooth and soft and then smelling like fried chicken.

2666 2018-10-23 19:12:38 You'll love it! It Brings back the shine and texture. I usually rinse my hair with rose water after washing that oil makes it smell good and give better results
2667 2018-10-23 19:12:31 The Feds don't buy any oil at all, ever... none, other than that you are correct.
2668 2018-10-23 19:12:27 Tea tree oil & Jojoba oil are amazing
2669 2018-10-23 19:12:24 Energy shares continue to underperform as the crude oil rally stalls
2670 2018-10-23 19:12:08 And these products are produced how? Have you ever even seen a refinery? So would you support a pipeline if 100% of the oil was used to produce lubricants and other products? But how would you transport them? Your logic is well.........nonexistent.
2671 2018-10-23 19:12:08 Tone of voice matters. We’re all to blame, so do nothing? Or, we’re all to blame, so fix it. There is no telling how many must get on board to fix it, but the more the merrier. Lest you balk at “fix it”, or “get on board”, it’s simple; tear up an oil company’s business license!
2672 2018-10-23 19:11:49 Well that'll never happen to oil so...

...oh wait.
2673 2018-10-23 19:11:47 Couldnt we wrap up a 10billion or so bill that would buy those Lavs for our own millitary and help retool that refinery in St Johns that just burnt down as well as some other refineries so that they can process Alberta and we can stop importing blood money oil?
2674 2018-10-23 19:11:39 Someone help when your gas runs out quick does that mean you need an oil change???
2675 2018-10-23 19:11:29 Look up ground source energy or air source energy. The future is already available. I know, I use it and use no oil or gas.
2676 2018-10-23 19:11:29 Big dirty oil still rules the world
2677 2018-10-23 19:11:27 How many other words did you do? Shell Oil springs to mind for me.
2678 2018-10-23 19:11:22 The delusions of Simon Bridges are NOT breaking news. 
Really Newshub, could you make your political preference any more obvious. 
How about a headline showing how oil has dropped in price
2679 2018-10-23 19:11:20 So much we extract oil to make refinery cost effective?
2680 2018-10-23 19:11:19 A good bet you don't heat your home with oil, right? Screw the carbon tax, period.
2681 2018-10-23 19:11:00 Hats off to the brave citizens who took time to do their work in restoring order in the cbd today . A shop was reselling cooking oil at $15 whch they bought at whole sale price less than $3.60 they bravely called the owner and the supplier and the cooking oil later sold at $4.20
2682 2018-10-23 19:10:44 @MirMAKOfficial 

Sir can we compare LNG deal @ $272,000 / day with the today's agreement of deferred oil payments?
2683 2018-10-23 19:10:43 True dat. Even if the price of oil is quite high again, there's no longer the profit-fuelled lust, because everybody knows those days are gone.

Anyone with any sense is looking for the new 'black gold'. And Scotland *ought* to be well poised to reap the benefits. Time will tell.

2689 2018-10-23 19:10:07 So the petrol suppliers being wonderful people will immediately drop the price of petrol !  NOT
When oil goes up the put petrol up immediately despite it being what is in stock. When it comes down, we wait until the get a stock of the cheaper stuff.

2692 2018-10-23 19:10:01 The risk averse mood in equity markets continued, S&500 down as much as 1.5% to lowest since May, and European and Asian indices losingn 1%-3%. That sentiment (plus Saudi output pledge) rubbed off on oil (-4.5%), and US bond yields fell.  AUD and NZD were surprisingly resilient..
2693 2018-10-23 19:10:00 When you start with Sweetie you lose the argument. Many doctors won’t even accept Medicare anymore. Health insurance was affordable BEFORE the government got involved. Socialism@has only worked in Norway where they have very few people and plenty of oil to sell. Educate yourself.
2694 2018-10-23 19:09:50 We track the actual point A to point B exports, and not what was sold or tucked away as bonded storage. A lot of the US oil sitting in Singap. is also just sitting there in a similar fashion as it was intended for China. Which barrels do you remove when you track? Curious to know

2703 2018-10-23 19:08:49 I remember exactly what this country was like before joining the (then) EEC. It was fucked.

Thanks to a combination of being a member of the rich European club, North sea oil and the finance industry, we thrived.

Unfortunately, this reignited our superiority complex.
2704 2018-10-23 19:08:38 Chuck, you're right on the money. Stop buying Saudi oil, you can be the first on your block to get a horse for yourself, the wife, and one each for the little Adlers.

2714 2018-10-23 19:07:40 (1) You really have to watch repair places. Took my F-150 to Gray Daniels Ford to get oil changed, asked them to check out my tire that kept slowing losing air pressure. Their response - you've got a nail in it but it's too close to the edge to plug. You need a new tire.
2715 2018-10-23 19:07:38 Don't buy into Post media, American hedge fund owned, PR for big oil, and american style capitalism scam. It is a tacky tabloid first and foremost

2720 2018-10-23 19:07:10 Not sure how believable that scenario is. 
   Only way I see any credibility in that explanation is Venezuela acting like a PAC using Chinese money. China is in need of replacing Iranian oil with another source.

2731 2018-10-23 19:06:09 Today is the day that an entire BARREL (159 litres) of Western Canadian Select Oil is equivalent in price:

to a 12 pack of beer (4.4 litres)
or
to a 24 pack of Coca Cola (8.8 litres).

Insanity. Pure, insanity.

Let it sink in.
Western Canadian Select Oil is $0.13 US per litre.

2766 2018-10-23 19:03:07 Things I wish I brought from Japan for my food-needs: sesame oil, my bento box, and my super duper cooking knife. Though that probably would not have made it past security... 
2767 2018-10-23 19:03:06 inject coconut oil into your heart. fucking. jam it in there. fuck. fucking. bathe in it. stick your face in it. fucking. coconut oil RAW
2768 2018-10-23 19:02:58 "USD 3 Billion" will be put in state bank of Pakistan for one year, 3 billion dollar oil a year on deferred payment for 3 years in total 12 billion package, reduction in visa fee for Pakistani workers, investment in oil and minerals in Pakistan.
2769 2018-10-23 19:02:45 Nope.. you enjoy trying to tick me off.. there’s a candid difference
2770 2018-10-23 19:02:44 you talking about the great fish oil buyout of 2018?
2771 2018-10-23 19:02:30 No more increase in oil prices???
Hahaha. 
Anyways Mubarak ho ! Bheek Mil gayi...
2772 2018-10-23 19:02:29 Sir this is just a temporary relief given to us by Saudis. The real thing is that we do fundamental structural reforms now. Bring back looted money, invest in youth and increase exports. The good thing is that oil prices are also reducing down in International market
2773 2018-10-23 19:02:27 Hey @justintrudeau If you want to tax carbon, start by taxing oil profits at 78%.
2774 2018-10-23 19:02:27 Oh I really hope you can buy those that would really be awesome for you Kelly.
I love art.
Can't pick my fav they're great in different ways. 
The glass with its base so real. Oil
Landscapes are my usual fav.
But the watercolour was so peaceful.  Wonderful my friend
2775 2018-10-23 19:02:10 Too bad oil money seems to interfere with decency
2776 2018-10-23 19:02:10 That was so smooth like baby oil
2777 2018-10-23 19:02:07 Our import bill for oil this year will be 15b $ so as we agreed the Saudi facility is a breather
2778 2018-10-23 19:02:00 Truth is hard for your kind 
So relax and mind your country trouble situation,,at list in my country our oil is for us not like you 
Giving your oil to others and working for them (hahaha) by hero and work to change this is better and wise thinking

Work hard to use brain 
2779 2018-10-23 19:01:55 3 billion per year for oil for three years- so total package is 12 b
2780 2018-10-23 19:01:55 Has anyone ever used CBD oil for their pets?? Best brands?
2781 2018-10-23 19:01:49 Lol I go to Florida you gotta supply the oil, toys and entertainment though.
2782 2018-10-23 19:01:47 I have peppermint oil so I’ll try it.. thanks!
2783 2018-10-23 19:01:44 Those who support no intervention in Yemen then also support giving control of the Bab el Mendeb Strait into the Red Sea to the Iranian Mullah terrorist regime. They would control the shipping not only of oil, but all goods.
2784 2018-10-23 19:01:42 That’s a good start. But the castor oil will make ur hair sooooo thick and lucious i promise. We gotta take a trip to Sally’s
2785 2018-10-23 19:01:40 What they're doing is deliberately cause monetary crisis. Reminds me of the Yugoslavian government in the 1983 deliberately holding back reserves of oil and other goods, causing an artificial inflation that cost millions of people all of their savings.
2786 2018-10-23 19:01:37 I should have drove Andre’s car so he can take mine to get a oil change
2787 2018-10-23 19:01:33 Hang there sweetie!  Have you tried CBD oil?
2788 2018-10-23 19:01:23 Imran Khan was impressive on his Saudi Mission..  Got what he went for.. Now Pakistan is in some level of relax before going to IMF.. Still a long way to go.. but Oil Prices may fall and Dollar Rate may also decrease..
2789 2018-10-23 19:01:17 You’re praising her for ending something that isn’t occurring. There is no oil off the Oregon coast and no drilling. You’re taking action against something that doesn’t exist.  One more reason this Oregonian will #VoteRed.
2790 2018-10-23 19:01:03 you mean dirt dirty oil
2791 2018-10-23 19:01:03 Before we get too excited - Our Annual petroleum import bill is $13.3bn - And expected to rise viciously considering the expected upsurge in oil prices. So a 3year $3bn deferred payment facility is good yet not enough to avoid IMF.
2792 2018-10-23 19:01:01 Me thinks it's time to make Mexico our 51st State! 
We'd get more oil, great eats, best tequila, much smaller southern border and best places to vacation to, instead of that pigsty California.  At least Mexico does not have humane feces in their streets and on their sidewalks.
2793 2018-10-23 19:00:59 Hey Santa @saniyusuf I have beard oil now, come lemme rub your beard.
2794 2018-10-23 19:00:57 You're right.

Hammer... No mallet.

Steak....

Poured boiling oil in January.

It'd be cruel to be kind.
2795 2018-10-23 19:00:56 Car experts, will cruise control stop working if you need an oil change?
2796 2018-10-23 19:00:38 They will be drinking imported water eating sugar and oil from SA. Alilanhloni?
2797 2018-10-23 19:00:35 #QOTD: Data isn't the new oil, actionable insights are.
2798 2018-10-23 19:00:33 ''Although China has invested heavily in renewable energy such as wind and solar, a key reason for its emissions growth is rising demand for oil and gas due to increased car ownership and electricity demand.''

This is more of the problem.

2808 2018-10-23 18:59:21 Putting aside Germany's demographic problems resulting from WW2 & our reliance on oil, it was obvious that the young male 'refugees' should have been directed to Saudi Arabia. They weren't. SA sticks two finger up to the law - as the immediate current situation makes very clear.
2809 2018-10-23 18:59:17 The last time I went I got an oil change, tires rotated and aligned... took FOUR HOURS. And I had an appointment set up.
2810 2018-10-23 18:59:16 "USD 3 Billion"

3Bn USD worth of Oil on deferred payment regime as well as 3Bn in stashed money for reserves shall definitely give Pakistan the breather
2811 2018-10-23 18:59:15 Sana oil xoxad
2812 2018-10-23 18:59:11 CASTOR OIL! Tea tree oil , coconut oil. I told u this woman!!! Help ur follicles out!!! Grow that hair!!!!!
2813 2018-10-23 18:59:02 Exactly. They are over-sold compared to prices of oil and NG. Also, no debt so rate hikes have zero effect on AmRoys. Several of these have been on my radar for a long time and they are at fire sale prices compared to a month or two ago. Also, with depletion ded, tax advantaged.
2814 2018-10-23 18:59:01 こんな深夜にぎがが見てるんか？ワイは寝てるから見てない
2815 2018-10-23 18:58:53 You do realize oil percolates from the ocean floor naturally & unabated?  You do realize oil is a natural resource harnessed by man in order to make life easier so we can go about our everyday life & post stuff that shows we don’t enjoy life at all bc we are perpetually angry?
2816 2018-10-23 18:58:47 Please talk about the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico that Trumps administration has forgotten And he wants to install more oil platforms all over our countries seas Please forward as this is so important PLEASE

2820 2018-10-23 18:58:16 Looks like oil field is poppin over here again it’s been fuckn busy they had rooms for 55$ but I saw the pictures was wack ass beds and shit I’m trying to get a room somewhere that has a tv for my Xbox 
2821 2018-10-23 18:58:15 Yeah, much better having to rely on Saudi oil.
2822 2018-10-23 18:57:57 i have a friend that has bad anxiety (especially when she smokes) but she like cbd oil
2823 2018-10-23 18:57:41 Oil of oregano. Tastes like hell, but that shit kills a cold.
2824 2018-10-23 18:57:35 BBC announces that queen’s grandson and a Suits Actor are being exhausted in Fiji republic with a population of just over half a million people. Isn’t it odd that BBC neglected to tell viewers that Fij won independence from England without oil, whisky or billions in agri-income?
2825 2018-10-23 18:57:33 A province that prefers and promotes Saudi imports to Canadian-produced oil should have its equalization payments (contributed by Alberta) denied.
2826 2018-10-23 18:57:32 Never mind their oil and their millions. We cannot allow a sadistic dictator like this to thrive.
2827 2018-10-23 18:57:20 Saudi Arabia agrees to give Pakistan Three Billion Dollars in terms of aid with oil reserves of worth 3 billions dollars per year.

2835 2018-10-23 18:56:45 It all has to do with the emissions on those as it would cost a fortune to tax them as they drink oil and petrol

2839 2018-10-23 18:56:12 Nokia isn't dead their Symbian phones which are camera less are still used in government facilities like oil refineries and such for security purposes
2840 2018-10-23 18:56:10 Yeah,he is a failure because he seized all the oil Wells from the former head of states and your associates and promise to allocate it to each states. He is also a failure because he removed salaries of your staffs at your farm that will go back to the rightful ow
2841 2018-10-23 18:56:00 @SenWarren according to the DNA
2842 2018-10-23 18:55:57 Oil prices are plummeting.... right before the elections. It’s the Russians! They’re flooding the market to give President Trump continued control of both houses.....or not. Like Seinfeld use to say...Newman! The Dems are saying....Trump!
2843 2018-10-23 18:55:55 If you think we are struggling, spare a thought for Venezuela, they have the largest oil reserves in the world but they are leaving on gvt handouts to eat. They can fill up a tank with a dollar worth of fuel.
2844 2018-10-23 18:55:49 I've been researching many alternative methods of treating medical conditions for my own personal reasons & IDK why, but grape seed oil or extract may help?

2846 2018-10-23 18:55:32 Guagud= a (drinking) container.
Brah= what remains of yogurt after the butter has been extracted. It is smooth sour milk. It is even served in Turkish restaurants in Europe.
Ajibo=the soft cheese, extracted by heating birah
Nihug=oil seed.
Hmir= i am not sure?
I hope it helps.
2847 2018-10-23 18:55:16 Well that’s because Germany doesn’t have fossil fuels sitting on German land. Sure there are pockets of coal, but there isn’t oil or natural gas, like there is in Scandinavian waters. Same goes for continental Europe.
2848 2018-10-23 18:55:09 Tea tree oil? Directly in the coochie?!
2849 2018-10-23 18:55:08 We have increased the debt. There is A huge oil spill, irresponsible policies that increase global warming induced disasters that KILL and leave billions in damage. Is that the new infrastructure plan? How irresponsible can you be? We are not stupid. Trumps base may be but not us
2850 2018-10-23 18:54:57 Congratulations 
2851 2018-10-23 18:54:45 Check out how #Alaska distributes oil profits for evidence...
2852 2018-10-23 18:54:41 He went to Saudi to get for free oil so don't get too excited.

2854 2018-10-23 18:54:32 An independent Scotland will be outside the EU and outside the UK so 100% of our trade will be under WTO regs.
Given our dire post oil, economic position I don’t believe we’ll be getting into EU for years
2855 2018-10-23 18:54:31 Because we are all not idiots, although the big oil and big coal and big diesel car companies treat us like we are!  As more people become educated in the truth and work out they have another option, the faster the word is spreading, that there’s a better way
2856 2018-10-23 18:54:28 Severe reductions in consumer and manufacturing packaging. Incentives to manufacture electric cars (not purchasing them) more electric - less choice for internal cumb. Public transit, and a label on every product indicating % fossil fuel/oil content and incentivize reductions.

2861 2018-10-23 18:53:29 Ladies-
If you ever want a confidence boost, go get your oil changed. Those guys will make you feel beautiful no matter how ratchet you look
2862 2018-10-23 18:53:26 owning a car is so expensive like oil changes, recalls, insurance,,,,, i wasn’t prepared for this
2863 2018-10-23 18:53:21 Scotland has no debt. The UK does though. Oil will last 125 years, at least the oil we know about. Huge areas of the sea around Scotland has reserves which are not yet being accessed. Scotland produces excesses of almost everything you need. England needs to import it all.
2864 2018-10-23 18:53:10 You so can if you're sitting on a few billion barrels of crude oil. Just watch.
2865 2018-10-23 18:53:02 They have to see for themselves
2866 2018-10-23 18:52:57 But you did good.
2867 2018-10-23 18:52:45 $100 oil is for sound bites and blood speculators ….
2868 2018-10-23 18:52:15 No better feeling than checking your oil and it being perfect  fareal tho.. especially after blowing an engine 
2869 2018-10-23 18:52:09 I’m a big fan of pan-fried cherry tomatoes on top of whatever else you’re making.

One idea: penne pasta.  Boil, then fry in olive oil & egg with garlic and black pepper. Add a large handful of cherry tomatoes. Optional spinach, cheese, onion.
2870 2018-10-23 18:52:09 The education comment was facetious as clearly education is an example of a social program which doesn't equate to socialism. Yeah he's mad at higher taxes. That's because Alberta's oil is locked up right now. Why do you think he wants the pipeline.
2871 2018-10-23 18:52:09 If my mum sells palm oil nd my dad sells gas and I tell my friends my parents are into oil and gas
Am i wrong?
2872 2018-10-23 18:52:03 First major success for PM IK. KSA agrees to place $3 Billion in State Bank of Pakistan to help out with balance of payment issue. Also, agrees to supply oil worth 3 Billion and to ease foreign exchange pressure. This is how foreign visit succeeds..

2878 2018-10-23 18:51:44 OIL OIL OIL... what else?
2879 2018-10-23 18:51:37 Hey  yeah still use olive oil but it will need less as they generally are wetter when mashing 
2880 2018-10-23 18:51:24 Snake oil peddler, proprietor of hack news site PrisonPlanet, and oddly bombastic host of InfoWars, a long-running radio show and network focusing on conspiracy talk (mostly right wing).

2884 2018-10-23 18:51:12 You are wanting to drill off the coast of California @realDonaldTrump why don't you take care of the on going oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico!
2885 2018-10-23 18:51:12 This hair powder and oil I bought smells like a spice for cooking (like a mixture of curry and thyme). My hair smells like chicken seasoning
2886 2018-10-23 18:51:11 Trump supporters will believe this crap but they think coal and oil will last forever !
2887 2018-10-23 18:51:04 However there are some who will Never abandon their ideology as history shows us. If we continue to wait until some come to that realization it harms us and infects others. Don't wait until the house is termite ridden, use Orange Oil!
(Double joke there!)
2888 2018-10-23 18:51:02 Agree. Context helps. But still, try these:

"Coconut oil may be bad for your health"

"Federer may lose this match"

"Petrol may touch Rs.100 per litre soon"
2889 2018-10-23 18:51:01 I suppose if you buy into the Rockefellers and Pews catastrophe warriors. But what are you doing to reduce your footprint? You want to kill Alberta oil, but bring in Saudi oil? Why don’t you just go after the Saudi’s? They seem interested in your opinion.
2890 2018-10-23 18:51:00 Try hemp oil it works for pain and anxiety
2891 2018-10-23 18:50:59 I was supposed to go get a oil change today but Autonation is just too far
2892 2018-10-23 18:50:51 At least send me some compensation oil 
2893 2018-10-23 18:50:35 Yep! I was a staunch palm oil activist till I heard about how it may be the least destructive of all oils. So i have yet to do my research on that. Till then I consume wholesome plant based foods & chose to live a life that loves all creatures great & small.  minimal 0 waste
2894 2018-10-23 18:50:31 Drilling for oil eventually evolved to Fracking. Is it silly to think solar technology would eventually evolve the same way? Man is the flaw here, not nature.
2895 2018-10-23 18:50:26 Even Hitler once lived in the same neighborhood as Leon Trotsky; Trump did not! 
Even Hitler once realized the strategic importance of coal gasification to the war effort, Trump never had his oil fields bombed!
Even Hitler annexed the Sudentenland!  Trump used eminent domain!
2896 2018-10-23 18:50:22 Oil price drops... cuz they are our friends.
2897 2018-10-23 18:50:18 Bit extreme for an oil change
2898 2018-10-23 18:50:15 If you do not want to be known as the servant who pours WATER on someone's hands in ministry (Elisha), you need to accept the fact you may never be the servant that God pours the OIL of anointing on.

2900 2018-10-23 18:50:03 Ya, that's a really good point. It was achievable via stock proxies in commodities like gold silver and oil.  It's also relevant to point out that the 70s followed the nifty fifty era of extreme overvaluation and concentration in US eq mkts.
2901 2018-10-23 18:49:59 Hey, oil changes are expensive and he usually cooks me dinner when he’s done changing it.

2904 2018-10-23 18:49:48 What baffles me is the faux outrage.. no one addresses the three reasons we are allies. 1. Iran 2. Oil 3. Israel. No one has ever thought they were going to turn into a democratic state with liberty and freedom.
2905 2018-10-23 18:49:46 Mr Moyo its unfortunate that it had to come to this but Mina I blame it on retailers. Bayasifihlela izinto and bazithengisa ngudlu. Even the cooking oil you supply to the retailers kithi ayifiki, sithengwa yizihlobo zabasebenza emashop nge back door.
2906 2018-10-23 18:49:31 Let's see what shakes out. Erdogan seems to enjoy being on the world stage, doesn't he? The military base thing is a huge element. But I know that the Qataris have been maneuvering via Saudi for a while. Saudi holds enormous treasure, both oil & the holy sites. It's a ripe pear.
2907 2018-10-23 18:49:30 Im a bond bear and even Im shocked by the resilience in rates...especially with oil prices
2908 2018-10-23 18:49:23 "USD 3 Billion" will be put in state bank of Pakistan for one year, 3 billion dollar oil a year on deferred payment for 3years in total 12billion package, reduction in visa fee for Pakistani workers, investment in oil and minerals in Pakistan. Wow wow

2914 2018-10-23 18:49:01 Because Morey Strong (Oil tycoon making billions off pushing the global warming conspiracy) keeps telling us we have to protect the planet as one people and using lots of flowery words to sell carbon credits on his Chicago Exchange and put in a NWO (not a democratic one.)
2915 2018-10-23 18:49:00 There's no killing, no blood, the cowboys are all robots, and their oil is green?

2919 2018-10-23 18:48:44 Well Done PM Imran Khan! Oil import of $3 billion worth on deferred payment for three years from Saudi Arabia and additional USD 3 billion to be parked in the Pakistan's National Treasury for 1 year by KSA. This will provide breathing space for sure #FutureInvestmentInitiative

2925 2018-10-23 18:48:23 KSA will deposit $3 bill for 1 year period with the State Bank of Pakistan to help address its worsening BOP position. KSA will also provide a $3 bill deferred payment facility for oil and invest in oil refinieries and mining industries. Hopeful that we will convert aid to trade.
2926 2018-10-23 18:48:14 Cobb: Need to focus on conservation as well. May be a carbon tax and a return to all of us with dividends. There are policies that can help us move off of fossil fuels.  Every person who is elected should not take a time for fossil fuels and for oil and gas.

2928 2018-10-23 18:47:52 No body from the Middle East would walk across two countries to get here, they would land in a private jet with lots of oil money, please. Lol that’s a stand up comedy line! Hilarious!
2929 2018-10-23 18:47:49 The friendly guys working Sunday advised on some oil based paints from the large selection available. Seagulls Paint is a great find... We'll be back!
2930 2018-10-23 18:47:48 Unfortunately, real threats often enable arms races. Putin wants the EU weakened because he has eyes on annexing other formerly permafrost nation’s like Finland, Sweden and Iceland because oil drilling will soon be possible, he’s looking ‘long game”. We have to have “deterrents”.
2931 2018-10-23 18:47:45 The idea is palm oil production. The fin implication is huge, BOA & BOI credits available if conditions are met and the biz plan is intact.

2933 2018-10-23 18:47:43 Let's not dramatize today's events in Riyadh. PM had to take decision on tackling economic crises. It shows genuine concern for the country& nation. It is an honourable deal, delaying payments for oil & keeping  3Bn$ in reserve for 3 yrs. Effort to avoid IMF.
2934 2018-10-23 18:47:34 Kahi CPEC to doi  pay to nahi lag giya jo Saudi ny oil refinery lagani ha wo kahan lagni ha Pakistan main 10000000 ghr kay bad jagah bcjy gi Kiya @WaseemBadami @_Mansoor_Ali

2937 2018-10-23 18:46:54 Oh quite agree. I'd rather linseed oil than oil-oil. But maaaaybe not the first choice for a bar interior if you're looking to attract the regatta vibe people...
2938 2018-10-23 18:46:48 Also how are IP's accounted?
What's the special role of the FED, as most foreign dept is denominated on USD? 
Is the USD backed by gold/oil contracts?
Is there are paradigm change insight?
Do you oversee externalities like sustainability?
It's really opaque to me.
Thanks again.
2939 2018-10-23 18:46:45 My mom really is petty...taking oil baths so the rest of us in the house can fucking fall when we go to take a shower.
2940 2018-10-23 18:46:35 Selective outrage, so long as Coasters don't ever see oil drills off their shoreline & gas is low, they're fine w/honor killings, killing of gay men, & killing of anyone that has an independent voice. Problem w/Khashoggi, he was part of the brotherhood; US politicians fav people.
2941 2018-10-23 18:46:35 Good! You hardly see any oil ships in the entire Dallas Fort Worth metroplex!
2942 2018-10-23 18:46:32 Accounts not my strong point but I could see #UEN as potential mover given low MCAP & the fact oil price was on a decent run, they also fetch a premium to spot. They had a chance of being debt free by YE & paying a nice divi. Russian directors effectively stealing cash killed it
2943 2018-10-23 18:46:30 Somebody organized it. Thousands of people don't all independently and spontaneously decide one day to walk a couple of thousand miles.

2955 2018-10-23 18:45:17 Why do you think that the oil price drops again? In the end when all the market for it has collapsed (electric cars for instance) I suppose the price at the pump could be Rock Bottom.

2960 2018-10-23 18:45:08 Did the oil industry think we were going to miss the millions of dollars they R spending to stop I-1631.  This state cares deeply about climate change. We R not in the deniers category. We see climate change, our air was filled with smoke, our forests on fire this summer 1631 YES
2961 2018-10-23 18:45:08 KSA agrees to place $3 Billion in State Bank of Pakistan to help out with balance of payment issue. Also, agrees to supply oil worth 3 Billion. First major success for PM IK.
2962 2018-10-23 18:45:05 Saying that palm oil isn't vegan is incorrect. Palm oil comes from plants. It is possible to buy organic ethical palm oil.

2975 2018-10-23 18:43:43 OK good. Hope it stays that way.
Well, I know someone who can send some CBD oil out by post if she wants to try it. It's just a liquid in a dropper. Might perk her up & chill her out if she needs it.
2976 2018-10-23 18:43:43 Getting an oil change & they’re rocking my car slightly & it’s making me sleepy as fuck.
2977 2018-10-23 18:43:42 Shows biased. In one of article you argued that increasing tax on oil was bad. Handing over oil reduction to consumer would have been stimulus. But now it is poplar what a hypocrite. I like your videos on Flipkart. But to speak on both sides it wrong. I agree asking oil companies
2978 2018-10-23 18:43:39 But why aren’t you bathing in coconut oil? It’s science.
2979 2018-10-23 18:43:37 No fuel  no cooking oil so what do u expect

2997 2018-10-23 18:42:05 There's a lack of demand because the oil/gas sector is in albeit slow decline and our glorious leaders in organisations like @AberdeenCC @Aberdeenshire & @OpportunityNE_1 are doing very little to genuinely diversify the economy away from oil n gas.
2998 2018-10-23 18:41:59 It’s disturbing that a 14 year long oil spill isn’t THE worst.

3007 2018-10-23 18:41:13 i mean it did sound like an interesting thing but like i said its been SOOO long and all of a sudden coincidentally when this oil situation occurs that now you care about the people that have been not included for how long now? yeah. idk how to feel.

3011 2018-10-23 18:41:07 Science-y things I've learned (so far) from reviewing Happy Days:
1. Olive oil won't "coat your stomach" and prevent you from getting drunk.
2. Eating fish is good for your hair.
3. Tonsillectomies are kind of dangerous and maybe unnecessary.

3016 2018-10-23 18:40:51 9/11 was a carefully planned Deep State Psyop, bankrolled by Prince Alaweed of Saudi Arabia, planned by CIA and Mossad for the mass murder of thousands. Our government was complicit. Mueller played a big part in 9/11. Globalists wanted excuse to invade Middle East to control oil.
3017 2018-10-23 18:40:50 Do you? Agen other countries of similar size and population are are doing a lot better. So why would Scotland fail? And don't forget we have more natural resources. Not just oil.

3036 2018-10-23 18:39:37 Which is amusing, because there seems to be no such concern for what we do when coal and oil are gone...
3037 2018-10-23 18:39:28 Oil prices fall more than 4 percent as investors sell off stocks amid concerns about slowing global economic growth. Saudi Arabia's energy minister seeks for a second straight day to assure markets that the kingdom will keep the world adequately supplied with crude.
3038 2018-10-23 18:39:20 Why are we still using oil? Oh yes, corporate profit trumps the existence of a inhabital planet.
3039 2018-10-23 18:39:05 How do we protest your employers support of big oil without canceling our subscriptions. Genuine question love your reporting but Dino Rossi and no on 1631 seem almost unforgivable and yet we keep giving them a platform
3040 2018-10-23 18:39:04 They got that "SCIENCE THING" in their blood man.
Just tell them that were gonna 
ship all that Saudi oil on our "SPACE FORCE" ships and refuel the sun. 
Then we will set off a big nuclear bomb to restart it.

3044 2018-10-23 18:38:48 It's Patanjali Kesh Kanti hair oil. My dad uses it regularly and I swear he is getting his hair back and they are black in colour..
3045 2018-10-23 18:38:41 KSA will deposit $3Billion into State Bank Of Pakistan also will provide #Oil worth of $9Billion on deferred price!!
History is witness that Kingdom of SaudiArabia never left Pakistan solitary in it's arduous times!!
3046 2018-10-23 18:38:37 Migrant invasion, oil plummeting, KSA can deliver an infinite amount by turning a valve.
Preview of 2020?
3047 2018-10-23 18:38:36 That old school mix of baby lotion and baby oil with a dash of obsession.
3048 2018-10-23 18:38:20 accidentally drank skrait oil today. my body is decaying at an alarmingly fast rate.
3049 2018-10-23 18:38:16 Shaping up to be a big day tomorrow, decent rally in the #es and oil off, #airlines could be interesting.
3050 2018-10-23 18:38:12 Doing a lil (okay, a lot of) research on fracking and wastewater injection in Oklahoma for a values/worldview analysis activity, and it's *pretty funny* to read actual reports, and thennnnn how the oil and gas industry represents such reports. Looking forward to class.
3051 2018-10-23 18:38:05 Lets meet sibili and cry together gaya...instead of giving you something to eat i wl bring cooking oil for u 
3052 2018-10-23 18:37:57 A lot of the open space in Contra Costa County, SF Bay area, is owned by the oil and chemical companies that have three oil refineries and one chemical plant on our coasts. Pipelines above and below ground.
3053 2018-10-23 18:37:55 Yeah @petenajarian was in full crystal-ball mode on the VIX call

My guess is more to come... Kashoggi, Midterm Elections, Oil.... we're in for a rocky ride into 2019.
3054 2018-10-23 18:37:45 Crude Oil plunges nearly 4%.  Worst day since July.
3055 2018-10-23 18:37:42 wtf who called the oil plunge?
3056 2018-10-23 18:37:27 Ghrit kumari, Wheat germ oil,Sunflower oil, Bhringraj, Gudhul, Brahmi, Amla, Mehendi, Neem leaf, Baheda, Harar(big), Giloy, Jatamansi, Haldi, Nagkesar, Bakuchi, Gurhal pusp, Charela, Yashti madhu, anantmool, Rasaut, and Vacha. Coconut oil and til oil are the bases
3057 2018-10-23 18:37:21 USD 3 Billion" will be put in state bank of Pakistan for one year, 3 billion dollar oil a year on deferred payment for 3years in total 12billion package, reduction in visa fee for Pakistani workers, investment in oil and minerals in Pakistan. Wow wow
3058 2018-10-23 18:37:15 Shouldn't it be 'doesn't' sir?
3059 2018-10-23 18:37:07 @rushlimbaugh  Make Honduras & Mexico a US Territory. Bigger Military for USA & Oil in those Countries
3060 2018-10-23 18:37:07 The Government of Canada does not buy oil from anywhere including Canada.
3061 2018-10-23 18:36:45 We buy a lot of oil from Saudi Arabia.  Too bad there wasn't some way to ship our oil from Alberta to eastern Canada.  Maybe a pipeline.  #Trudeau #TrudeauMustGo
3062 2018-10-23 18:36:36 They are busy exactly that. Giving insentives to export industries, and slapping a whole load of extra duty and tariffs on imports. Personally, is go ahead with banning cooking oil and tea. So instead of cheap imported canola oil/vegetable oils, the plentiful  is used for oil
3063 2018-10-23 18:36:36 An invigorating facial mask, earthy cobalt blue, with seaweed, olive oil, and exfoliating crushed lemon seed. It comes as a free-flowing liquid.
3064 2018-10-23 18:36:32 Cancellation of the arms deal may lead to the Saudis cancellation of the oil deal. I think eastern Canadians need oil this winter. Now if only there was a pipeline from AB to the east! Has anyone ever thought of that?
3065 2018-10-23 18:36:32 I’m a firm believer that CBD oil helps me so much with my chronic migraines
3066 2018-10-23 18:36:22 Saudi Arabia to give Pakistan $3 bln in aid, defer oil payments to ease crisis
3067 2018-10-23 18:36:15 PC Conservatives run the New World Order until that changes i fear we are on the road to destuction. oil ,weapons, plundering public taxmoney and warmongering are their tools of their trade

3072 2018-10-23 18:35:37 A world without oil and natural gas looks alright in the pictures.

3075 2018-10-23 18:35:18 The people calling this crushing and horrible are the ones w/previous Admins who were silent as women are killed for honor or gay men killed by behheading or tossed off buildings. It's all disgusting, think about that when getting gas or heating oil; it's why they get to do this.

3078 2018-10-23 18:35:06 And what is "digital motor" all about.  That's just cobblers.

Expensive snake oil owned by a scrounging tax evader.
3079 2018-10-23 18:35:00 The bonespur draft dodger wont send squat. Last time he sent immigration and lawyers to fill out the paperwork.  Republicans only user the military for oil and political props.
3080 2018-10-23 18:34:53 How the fuck can oil spill for 14 years?!?!?
3081 2018-10-23 18:34:48 People be acting like skateboarding is cool. No it’s not cool, just like jiffy lube isn’t cool. It’s necessary and monotonous. You will do the same shit over and over until you get one good synthetic oil change.
3082 2018-10-23 18:34:46 @muneebfaruqpak "it was also agreed that a one year  deferred payment facility for import of oil, up to $3B. This arrangement will be in place for three years, which will be reviewed thereafter."
So v hv to clear every year the import of deferred payment. So 12B is incorrect
3083 2018-10-23 18:34:41 There has been an oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico releasing 10-30 thousand gallons A DAY since 2004!!!!!! TWO THOUSAND FOUR PEOPLE IT HAS BEEN SPILLING OIL FOR 14 YEARS AND NO ONE HAS SAID ANYTHING OR DONE ANYTHING
3084 2018-10-23 18:34:36 Where do you trade oil/what ticker?
3085 2018-10-23 18:34:33 EXTRA SUGAR EXTRA SALT. EXTRA OIL AND MSSGGGGG
3086 2018-10-23 18:34:31 We the Apex Commodities International Holdings Limited write to inform all interested buyers of Bonny Crude Oil (BLCO) that we have 4million barrels available in Lagos water now and we are in need of serious buyers.

3087 2018-10-23 18:34:27 Working on it mate 

ideally i need to get a new phone first because i have an 10 year old iphone 4 which well the camera may aswell be an oil painter

but ill try sort something soon ... also need to clear the cobwebs away 
3088 2018-10-23 18:34:27 But...back in the day i was hitting a SFV og or a Tahoe cant remember witch one and it was pure fire. This was years ago and the oil from the grape ape wasnt bad either besides taste was too grapey at times.
3089 2018-10-23 18:34:24 Little more oil. That'll dull it down, it's going to be.
3090 2018-10-23 18:34:19 If only the indigenous people had reacted like the Republicans. I would be sitting in Germany or England and the Buffalo would still roam, water would be clean, forests would protect us, and gold, coal and oil would still be in the ground. That would be cause for celebration.
3091 2018-10-23 18:34:12 I heard Its total of $12billions in 3 years. $9Bils for oil payments and $3 for CAD. Plus oil refinery and minerals related investment too.
3092 2018-10-23 18:34:11 It does'nt take being a genius to know that Zim is the biggest economic experiment in the history of mankind
The cooking oil companies sabotage for a wk and it they make millions from panic buying
If Zimbabweans stand up against this kind of robbery surely our economy wil recover
3093 2018-10-23 18:33:57 But I agree. There are new discoveries e.g. the oil and vermiculite. But of course the vermiculite concession was sold on terms where it is for export only in its raw state. I am interested in what assets you have in mind.
3094 2018-10-23 18:33:52 Kahn: These wars are for oil, they're for empire. They're for ego. We need to transform our foreign policy to better balance our military strength with diplomatic wisdom.

3101 2018-10-23 18:33:14 But will TRUDEAU stop the SAUDI oil from coming in??? Try asking that idiot a tough one?
Honestly you guys let him get a pass on everything that matters!
We have enough energy here not to buy a drop. Where do you think the Saudis get the $$$ from?

3104 2018-10-23 18:33:07 They’re great! they’re lightweight oils that are absorbed into the skin easier so you’re not left with a lot of oil sitting on top of the skin like with other oils.
3105 2018-10-23 18:33:03 They also buy Nootropics, Vitality, and other literal snakeskin oil
3106 2018-10-23 18:32:59 Use nair! My shit look just like I got a wax. No cap. Baby oil kind
3107 2018-10-23 18:32:59 Taylor oil spill is another compelling reason to ban offshore drilling.
3108 2018-10-23 18:32:49 Your Twitter bio about natural resource extraction is so apt. We’ve long compared those who tightly hold public records — both gov’t archives/agencies and commercial genealogy co’s — to people who struck oil in their backyards. They’re turning public resources into a commodity.
3109 2018-10-23 18:32:40 The bottle tops on the cbd oil are impossible. I have to get help to open it every morning.

3117 2018-10-23 18:32:18 We stay away from Saudis while our PM is busy to take lian and oil. To Whom we trust?

3121 2018-10-23 18:31:47 I didn't say it would have survived it if it was capitalist but it definitely did not help that the economic crisis started long before 2014, when the country's money makers had left. There had only been one goverment owned oil company working on producing oil  since 2010.
3122 2018-10-23 18:31:45 so many fakes i switched tanks. They got sour ds for 45$ that are trash with no high and some selling for 50$ same. It seems like you guys went from potent ogs to artificial flavs back to regular oil that is not potent.
3123 2018-10-23 18:31:40 #ForRecordSake 
The crude oil import bill for India is expected to increase by $37 billion to $125 billion during the current financial year (2018-19) - a 42 % spike over 2017-18 (FY18) bill of $88 billion, as per latest estimates by Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC).

"Oil giant Saudi Aramco said it signed 15 memoranda of understandings worth $34bn (£26bn). The company said these entities were from eight countries, including the US, Japan, China, India and the UAE."

3134 2018-10-23 18:30:42 US had been first in natural gas production since 2009. Let's see, who was President in 2009. Oh, right.

But it doesn't matter; Presidents don't determine who produces oil and gas. Actually, banks have more influence over it.

3140 2018-10-23 18:30:19 That’s right, #China imported about the same amount of #oil in Sept. I was referring to additional oil that was stored in NIOC’s leased tanks in China.

3152 2018-10-23 18:29:20 The country wouldn't have resisted economic downturn if it was Capitalist or some shit. Venezuela put all their effort and their economy into the oil trade, their primary export. As such when the price of oil dropped in 2014 their economy collapsed. They were on this path long

3160 2018-10-23 18:28:43 @CorribOil
Now that the price of a barrel of oil has dropped $66. Will corrib oils be dropping its pump price instantly? I guess they will, because when it went to $77 a barrel it went up at the pumps the same day.
Stop the rip off Corrib oil. Drop your price's.

3173 2018-10-23 18:27:28 The “UN” ipcc , please let’s just get the scale right. Remember it’s that cabal which showed us how to run frauds like the UN food for oil pgm or was it the UN fraud for oil pgm, I forget which.  Anyway, they’re here to help, all you have to do is surrender your sovereignty.

3176 2018-10-23 18:27:24 I refuse to watch curry recipe videos made by white people because 1) no spice and 2) never enough oil/ghee/butter. Where the flavor at?!                       #food #curry #cook
3177 2018-10-23 18:27:13 Did either address what real state investment in economic development look like? Does either candidate see shale oil fracking as missed opportunity? Whatever happened to students' lobbyist? Will either claim to be the "education" gov?
3178 2018-10-23 18:26:56 A little profit taking at the end of the day pulled grain prices back a bit, but still impressive, with equities erasing losses as well. Crude oil still down 4.5%. corn up 1, beans dn 1, wheat up 1, KC stdy, MN fractionally lower. #oatt

3181 2018-10-23 18:26:45 Because of oil we have  a better standard of Living, longer life span, clean water, clean air, A house, a car, schools, and better “MEDICATION”   Denying this standard of living to our children and grandchildren is to send them back into the pass where living was harsh.

3189 2018-10-23 18:26:17 Pierre Poutine would have you believe that Canadians are "forced" to buy Saudi oil. The truth is the Irvings buy Saudi oil and sell the refined product to consumers and that Energy East was planned as an export only pipeline for Alberta's tar sands goop.
3190 2018-10-23 18:26:09 An oil wrestler, no less! Would make things rather interesting. 
3191 2018-10-23 18:26:08 It's a wonderful, delicious cheese. I suggest pairing it with seasoned heirloom tomatoes, olive oil, and balsamic vinegar.

3197 2018-10-23 18:25:32 Worst mistake I've ever made in my life. KFC made me stop eating rice outside. Fried rice was tasting like concoction my mother will prepare with just palm oil, onions and salt 
3198 2018-10-23 18:25:31 Not at all. Man is trying. Look at his projects, they speak for themselves. How many pensioners were neglected over the years even when the oil revenues were booming? How many died waiting for their hard earned money? President Buhari is the man.

This will likely reduce the size of Pak's IMF bailout.

3216 2018-10-23 18:23:56 If your struggling for calories. 

Try drinking your calories bro.

Like make a shake add olive oil, coconut oil or peanut butter 

Ice cream etc etc 

This will help ramp up the calories 

Also makes it easier to get your calories in

3219 2018-10-23 18:23:48 They are not understanding,
3220 2018-10-23 18:23:38 Oil giant Saudi Aramco said it signed 15 memoranda of understandings worth $34bn (£26bn). The company said these entities were from eight countries, including the US, Japan, China, India and the UAE.
3221 2018-10-23 18:23:35 Saudi Arabia has agreed to loan Pakistan $3 billion for one year as balance of payment support and to provide a one-year deferred payment facility for oil payments, up to $3 billion, "Foreign Office"
3222 2018-10-23 18:23:29 I added a can each of pinto, northern, and garbanzo beans. Plus some hominy. I didn't have any stock, so I used the liquid from those with some water, olive oil, salt, and spices as a pseudo-stock. Then added the mushrooms. I'll probably add lime and cilantro at the end.
3223 2018-10-23 18:23:27 If I am not mistaken, this is the first credit facility for oil that Saudis have provided since 1998, when Pakistan did nuclear tests.

3232 2018-10-23 18:22:28 We will agree there! Best solution is to get Alberta oil across this country and invest in refining capacity. We could lower the high cost of fuel and be self sufficient. We could also export more and use that revenue to support social services and infrastructure

3261 2018-10-23 18:19:39 Additionally, the USA has the ability to be the world’s largest exporter of natural gas and oil, China just found massive amounts in the South China Sea (currently fighting w/ japan over it) and India is creating more coal plants than before. Only Europe benefits.

3267 2018-10-23 18:19:21 FDD target for pointing out this oil transfer is the EU which, while having sanctions in place that include barring such oil transfers, nevertheless is establishing SPV to maintain JCPOA & continue trade w/Iran.

3272 2018-10-23 18:18:49 The world is not run by emotions.  When the muslims and christians were fighting religious wars , traders of every faith were enjoying protection in enemy's territories. Then it was Silk and now it's Oil which is keeping the world economy thriving.
3273 2018-10-23 18:18:49 Oh, you mean like the 1990 clean air act,  Oil Pollution Act. 1994 Environmental Justice. 1996 Food Quality Protection Act, Safe Drinking Water Act. 

I'd say those are pretty major. Still, stable economy with high taxes.
3274 2018-10-23 18:18:43 I heard it was 3 billion dollars of deffered oil payments.

THE WONDERFUL THINGS OIL CAN DO 
3295 2018-10-23 18:16:37 Okay, Twitter, when people back home have celebrated the USD 3 billion deferred payment arrangement with Saudi, it'd be worth knowing a) how much, if any, premium we'll have to pay on the price of oil, and b) how much, if any, interest we'll pay on the other $3 bn in SBP account.

3298 2018-10-23 18:16:16 And to be reliant on a commodity who's value is controlled by foreign cartels with no regard for Canadians security or prosperity, and can spark a recession by the stroke of a pen, is idiocy. You trust big oil to hire back those they laid off when the price of oil rises again?

3315 2018-10-23 18:14:41 Are you really a journalist ? Since evening , all the channels have aired this news that this facility is for 3 years & as such KSA will provide oil worth 9 billion dollars for 3 years on deferred payment , not for a year, as mentioned by you. 

That's why people make fun of you.

3324 2018-10-23 18:13:54 Its not happening. No one wins a trade war, especially consumers. It is the US consumers who pay through higher prices and who gets the tariffs ... duh ... the government.

3340 2018-10-23 18:12:34 Not sure the number there although point taken but still probably low overall. Also demand not supply drives emissions so one could argue Alberta oil wouldn't have a market overseas if no one wanted it.

Talking about distributing our development, how does the south south (oil producing region) compare to your capital?

Saying other African countries only focus on their capital is outrageous.

3356 2018-10-23 18:11:28 @AndrewScheer With regards to oil from SA, it's a drop in the bucket in terms of how much we buy from the US. Why are you not been accurate and truthful without covering up the truth? #ConservativeHorseshit
3357 2018-10-23 18:11:27 Don't be too harsh, you still need to goto the #IMF despite #SaudiArabia  loan, aid, deferred payments on oil imports or whatever.
3358 2018-10-23 18:11:23 The oil that we use to make plastic in natural, and we have oils all over us, so isn’t there always a way to make something naturally occurring?

3366 2018-10-23 18:10:33 #Alaska must diversify its economy. When #oil prices go down so does the economy. It’s too vulnerable if a new price war occurs with #OPEC.

3367 2018-10-23 18:10:31 as long as it keeps spending money on its people it looks pretty save. Wish I'd be around to see the day we're free of oil.
3368 2018-10-23 18:10:30 Our big reason of current account deficit is bcz of oil imports & saudi arabia is going to give us $3 billion worth of oil & it is on deffered payment. I think it's a very positive thing.

3385 2018-10-23 18:09:25 In Norway we mostly get electricity from waterfalls. No ideal solution, but far superior to coal, oil and nuclear.
3386 2018-10-23 18:09:12 Another oil spill?
3387 2018-10-23 18:09:12 It's benefiting Canada and helping people move toward a sustainable future away from gas products. Who knows how much oil is actually left? It's better this way.
3388 2018-10-23 18:09:03 When you say these things, you insult the president and those of us that are smart! The only country that has huge influence on oil price is Saudi Arabia, even USA doesn't have the clout! So bring the link where the president said so!

3390 2018-10-23 18:08:50 Canada provides more subsidy to oil and gas than any other G7 nation. Clearly its not efficient or viable in the long term.  That time passed long ago, there is far more opportunity in green tech than O&G.  Subsidies encourage investment, instead of propping up dying industry

3395 2018-10-23 18:08:29 Makes sense to me....if we all start to use renewables then Saudi would not have such a hold over the West cos we'dve  stopped using oil!
3396 2018-10-23 18:08:24 I want to askoooo. Did PDP steal our oil wells? Are we no longer selling oil even at 20 naira per barrel? If revenue are well managed poverty amongst Nigerians should be reducing not rapidly increasing. Worst thieves are around!

3403 2018-10-23 18:07:43 Well it was oil he slipped on 
3404 2018-10-23 18:07:42 No it wasn't can IMF give 3 billion dollars just to put as foreign exchange reserve ? No they don't. Oil deferred payments fix the issue giving fiscal deficit a much needed space for reforms not loans on interests.
3405 2018-10-23 18:07:40 Oil giant Saudi Aramco said it signed 15 memoranda of understandings worth $34bn (£26bn). The company said these entities were from eight countries, including the *US*, Japan, China, India and the UAE.

3418 2018-10-23 18:06:55 Best news I've seen today is oil plunging.  That's exactly what we needed - that's an interest rate cut to US consumer

Oil prices all tied to made up supply/demand story.  During oil crisis, read global inventories were 3B bbls.  What's that down to - 2.9B now?

3459 2018-10-23 18:03:17 Our current system gives power to minorities. Not the minorities you're thinking of. Superdelegates to are a minority and they greatly influenced the Dem primary. Big Oil corporations are a minority, we see the power that they have. Wealthy, old, and white rule the country.
3460 2018-10-23 18:03:16 Guess who just put in his own fuel pump, did his own oil change and did his own starter #ThisGuy

3467 2018-10-23 18:02:25 Truth is, it’s the OIL COMPANIES, like Irving Oil that buy and import wherever they choose to! NOT federal gov’t! Perhaps you should research a bit better and not blindly spew the lies that Scheer perpetuates! #cdnpoli#ScheerStupidity
3468 2018-10-23 18:02:25 Ain’t heard from him since. I wonder if he puttin baby oil his dick & lookin for the right angle
3469 2018-10-23 18:02:24 #Khashoggi Nothing will be done pure and simple. The West is broke and has no money. It also needs oil. Saudi has both. It is simple as that.

3472 2018-10-23 18:02:11 Good luck with the lira, with this amount of debt the lira will crash so  badly, that you will pay twice as much or even more for every product your country must import . For example oil..

3484 2018-10-23 18:01:34 Saturated fats come mainly from animals but there are also some plant sources such as coconut and palm oil. Animal sources include meats, lard, and milk products. Limiting saturated fats to less than 10% of your calorie intake for the day is ideal.
3485 2018-10-23 18:01:19 Hi there. This is a really important issue and we’ve been driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years. We’re on track to meet our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.

3491 2018-10-23 18:00:34 Nothing to smile about. Mediocrity of the highest level. Referee should be neutral but i gues Arab oil money played a big role in the outcome.
3492 2018-10-23 18:00:34 Imho, the only difference the #KhashoggiMurder will make, is that #MBS and the #Saudis will make sure to murder people more secretly in future! Their disgusting human rights abuses are more than enough reason to sanction the hell out of Saudi Arabia, screw the oil!!

3498 2018-10-23 18:00:19 Deffered payment is not that much attractive... I will see how KSA build oil refinery at Gawadar..as Power China already signed MOU with PSO for $8 billion refinery and pipeline April 2018
3499 2018-10-23 18:00:09 college is the LAST place to gain ANY knowledge of how the world is.  Granted, you can learn what a bunch of nonhacker professors THINK or WANT it to be.... but since they’re just academic slugs running a major scam, many 20-something fall for their snake oil.

3509 2018-10-23 17:59:15 Give me a break, Jimmy.   You caused the oil crisis, runaway inflation, gave the Panama Canal away to the Chinese, set up the fraudulent Dept. of Education, removed the Shah & allowed terrorists to take over 200 Americans hostage in Iran for over 12 months!  Shut up.
3510 2018-10-23 17:59:07 Crude oil looking bearish despite number of bulls.
Good news for consumers..
3511 2018-10-23 17:58:53 It's not subsidised and the demand will still be there whether we use our own oil or import it. Surely you can grasp that it's more environmentally friendly to use a local source instead of shipping it from all over the world?
3512 2018-10-23 17:58:46 Our hunger for cheap oil and investments enabled this. Not only in the US.
3513 2018-10-23 17:58:40 Perhaps The Money/jobs, while helps USA, is not the main reason to work with Saudi Arabia in Peace in ME ?   Is S.A oil decreasing?  Just a rumor. ?
3514 2018-10-23 17:58:39 What war?
When U.S declare a war to a country with no formal Government, when a few soldiers crossed the river, when this was on dispute,, funny thing 1848 U.S won the war and 1949 found gold in California and oil in Texas 1000s civlians died in veracruz
3515 2018-10-23 17:58:38 The news won't tell you this, but I will. Usually, the market has segments that see-saw as certain aspects sink, others rise.

3523 2018-10-23 17:58:22 @cafreeland @JustinTrudeau  Empty comdemnation when we keep importing a couple billion worth of Saudi oil instead of using Canadian oil, all because of failed government policy. Shameful hypocrisy #canpoli
3524 2018-10-23 17:58:21 Price will increase.NS wasted low oil price benefits
3525 2018-10-23 17:58:21 "oil? who said something about oil? Bitch you cooking?"
3526 2018-10-23 17:58:19 First time coming to get my oil change and instead of problems I’m getting a discount.

3529 2018-10-23 17:58:07 Then maybe the lying sack of shit can explain why oil prices are the same as what Alberta pays and they have a carbon tax
3530 2018-10-23 17:58:07 i use organic jojoba oil!! I apply before bed and in the morning. It's also good for other things like hair, makeup remover, cleanser, moisturizer etc! $6 at trader joes!
3531 2018-10-23 17:58:06 Good news for Pakistan. Saudi Araiba gives 3 bn. $ for one year and. 3bn $ yearly fof three years for Oil.
3532 2018-10-23 17:58:02 plus oil refinery. 3 lak kash.
3533 2018-10-23 17:57:53 Sure, good plan and we should implement these techs. However, we still rely on oil heavily which is not gonna change anytime soon. Plus overall, we as a nation are not going to impact the environment in any significant way. We make up less than 2% of the global emmisions
3534 2018-10-23 17:57:53 Ultimately Oil sabpe bhari padega...  KSA!

3536 2018-10-23 17:57:45 so another oil spill happened in the gulf where the company claimed only 2 gallons/day were leaking into the ocean, but reports show that 72,000 (THOUSAND) gallons are spilling each day. just f*ck the earth right????

3538 2018-10-23 17:57:41 People surprise you with their denial, their inability to keep up.  The CEO of Business New Zealand, Kirk Hope on @radionz still criticising the Government for the oil and gas decision.  Kirk are you thick?  We, as a species, have no choice.  We can't burn any more fossil fuels

3540 2018-10-23 17:57:30 Britain having earth quakes since oil started going there .need more
P Roof than that.
3541 2018-10-23 17:57:30 But this is too early to say. You can't predict or evaluate the oil prices, on average or prediction base, but the ultimate solution is to raise your exports by double digits to imports, or otherwise, be ready to be stuck in gambling.
3542 2018-10-23 17:57:29 The "check is in the mail" sales scam!  Trump is surely snake oil salesman of the year.
3543 2018-10-23 17:57:28 saudis are not worried about it as the USA is their back up. as money talks and oil is vital to the USA.
3544 2018-10-23 17:57:27 They're kind of pricey, yeah? I really want to try CBD oil but I just don't have the extra cash.
3545 2018-10-23 17:57:21 I drink plenty of olive oil I’m great
3546 2018-10-23 17:57:13 Clearly you don't understand what an invasion is, unless there's oil involved right?

It may be many other factors vs just feeling 'only.' need daughters raised to get dirty, change oil, hammer nails, etc..
3551 2018-10-23 17:56:43 @transportfever why is one of my oil refinery’s not kicking out fuel? There’s zero potential but oil has 1600 potential and they ship to the same town. Can you explain it for me so I can fix it?
3552 2018-10-23 17:56:38 What is a person who actions do not align with his words? Trudeau is a Hypocrite while he advocates human rights, he funds the economies of Countries like Saudi Arabi with purchase of BLOOD tainted oil with no pollution consideration and tell Canadians we have to do better.
3553 2018-10-23 17:56:36 Had taken car to the shop.  Long story short:  Metal shavings in oil.  So it's either new engine or new car.

3559 2018-10-23 17:56:25 The fetishism towards old, old houses, usually by people who haven't lived in one, rings true. Friends & family would say, "but it's so lovely here" when all I craved was central heating, warm hands & to not have to ration the heating oil...

3562 2018-10-23 17:56:10 You're saying I'm right about something I never said and then saying you agree with it. I'm not here to argue with you. All Scheer had to say was that he'd need more info on the contract before deciding and then make his spiel about Arab oil.
3563 2018-10-23 17:56:09 @WWERomanReigns cancer it is virus attack just do what I am saying everyday in early morning before brushed do oil pulling daily by Olive oil minimum 3 months then u can check up you will cure soon just try don't avoid this msg

2) We are slow at responding on here. Apologies.
3) Truffle oil in a mojito -- I (to be fair, this is one person's opinion) lean towards nea. Truffle works in cocktails, but typically with more savoury things like cognac. 
4) Truffle is king.

3571 2018-10-23 17:55:26 I told the older lady training the mechanics during my oil change that I’d like less inquiry into “what I do for work and fun” from the employees and she nodded like she’s been thru this before. Then she yelled at them to HURRY UP AND STOP CHATTERING and gave me a wink. My team.
3572 2018-10-23 17:55:14 America just became the world's number one oil producer again.
3573 2018-10-23 17:55:12 I stocked up on oil again. Life is good.
3574 2018-10-23 17:55:10 Purposely not showing the pain on their faces. Disgusting propaganda. We should be done with SA. We don't need their f'ing oil any more.

3582 2018-10-23 17:54:38 Venezuela is the textbook definition of socialism, the control of means of production has made its own wealth creators to leave. Most oil workers now work in the US as a result. You dont get to ignore Venezuela and say it's not socialism while you see its effects in full force.

3584 2018-10-23 17:54:32 I thought I read somewhere that up until the mid 20th Century, Iceland and Norway were among the poorest of European nations. Norway has done well because of oil.
3585 2018-10-23 17:54:28 On basis that economy is an oil tanker not a speedboat is Trump largely reaping the benefit of all the work Obama did to turn things round post 08 crash. If so his own actions can only be properly judged in the fullness of time.

3587 2018-10-23 17:54:23 Some lady just got mad at me because there is canola oil in nearly all of our products and she can’t eat here because of it 
3588 2018-10-23 17:54:19 I used to be able to buy Pfuko maheu at 50cents now it’s $1.

I used to be able to drive in at any service at any moment and get petrol. 

I used to be able to buy cooking oil without purchasing $15-$20 worth of groceries.

I will not even go into the impact on my businesses. 
3589 2018-10-23 17:54:17 How is cooking oil going to be cheaper ?
3590 2018-10-23 17:54:15 I took CBD oil into CoX rather than using super restores and did great btw
3591 2018-10-23 17:54:14 for the first time in like 3 years i went to get an oil change and the mechanic said “your brakes look AMAZING” instead of trying to get them replaced 

like

yeah

they’re brand new and ceramic they’d better look amazing
3592 2018-10-23 17:54:10 PTIofficial RT ArifCRafiq: At the #FII2018 in Riyadh, ImranKhanPTI played the role of marketer-in-chief of his country and did a fine job. Pleased to see that there was ample discussion of investment in Pakistan's oil and gas industries. #NayaPakistan #PTI #NationalAssembly
3593 2018-10-23 17:54:05 When nawaz sharif became PM in 2013 oil prices came  down to $40 a barrel from $140 but he did nothing  to use such a huge opputunity for the betterment of public1/2
3594 2018-10-23 17:54:04 If you are a member of a royal family, the royal family owns an oil rich country as a freehold what would stop you from selling as much as oil as you can?
3595 2018-10-23 17:53:49 Went to the beauty supply store for no reason and ended up leaving with hair gel that has cannabis oil in it 
3596 2018-10-23 17:53:47 I do not consider my self to be a geologist ,However before investing I look at variables. I believe the weald is by nature!! naturally fracking due to the re position of the plates.This is releasing small tremors and in fact releasing oil and gas.Which was trapped previously.
3597 2018-10-23 17:53:44 Trump: Stop killing our CIA guys.
MBS:  We'll pump more Oil.
Trump: The Kushogi thing is forgotten.
3598 2018-10-23 17:53:37 Carbon tax but still not dealing with the ethical issues associated with Saudi oil. Enough already. You want to talk about protecting the environment then do the right thing and have Canadians consume Canadian oil which is the cleanest oil in the world.
3599 2018-10-23 17:53:29 bro i took some cbd oil and it fixed my computer you gotta try this shit
3600 2018-10-23 17:53:13 How much "Carbon Tax" are you putting on Foreign imports @liberal_party @JustinTrudeau ?  So since we hardly use our own Alberta Oil because we can't build a pipeline in our own country, we're forced to buy Oil and other things from other countries, what will they pay?
3601 2018-10-23 17:53:06 Cone comes off tomorrow!!!!!!! We gonna have a trash da cone party  
You sounds like me only I found da cord to an oil Dee-few-zer an mum was not happy 
Oh oh while you on da ibone store switch over da app and buy more treats fur u my wuff 
3602 2018-10-23 17:53:05 Oil in return for silence over the blood of innocent Yemenis and Khashoggi...
A cruel bargain
3603 2018-10-23 17:52:59 FTSE hits 7 month low due to (1) problems with US Federal Reserve (2) Saudi murder affecting investors (3) rising oil prices (4) Brexit uncertainty (5) Sluggish growth in China (6) Italy dispute with EU re spending budget (7) poor performance in Germany. Other than that all good.
3604 2018-10-23 17:52:53 Conditioner & hair oil too?
3605 2018-10-23 17:52:52 Riyadh: PM K Daura Saudi Arab Me Aham Paish Raft, 12 Arab Dollars Ka Package Hasil, Saudia Ka Pakistan Me Oil Refinery Bhi Bananay Ka Faisla
3606 2018-10-23 17:52:52 Name the individuals...that you run with a headline says a lot about you. Lol. 

Go and look for the meaning of the phrase "under recovery". It's also practiced in the oil industry in India. That's what the nnpc is doing. You guys should spend more time reading than Wailing
3607 2018-10-23 17:52:49 Yup... the low price of oil and advance technology has nothing to do with the job losses... just the politicians you don’t like.
3608 2018-10-23 17:52:47 #Oil Down Almost 5% as Saudis Agree to Max out Supply
3609 2018-10-23 17:52:45 "do hyall see organic crude oil in them there aihles? that sweet black gold that we call oil?" - me doing funny oil baron voice at my coworkers for 5 hours straight
3610 2018-10-23 17:52:42 I think if oil remains, on average, between $50-$60 per barrel; then Pakistan can easily manage its balance of payments.
But real solution is increase in exports & FDI
3611 2018-10-23 17:52:27 @RalphGoodale   Cancelling the Lvv contract putting 2000 Canadians out of work won't hurt or punish the Saudis. They'll just give it to the USA. The issue isn't the contract in Canada. A better solution would be to stop buying their oil.  Canada has oil + owns a pipeline
3612 2018-10-23 17:52:10 ... Your head get oil
3613 2018-10-23 17:52:04 指標ぐらい漢字にしろ
3614 2018-10-23 17:52:03 Boiling in oil.
3615 2018-10-23 17:51:57 Give it to me.They’re right, use the tea tree oil. Also the rosehip oil has done wonders for my scarring
3616 2018-10-23 17:51:43 If McKenna and the oil companies oppose this measure, it is sure worth a vote in favor.
3617 2018-10-23 17:51:40 結局こんな時間まで蝶をしひょうとした環境評価読んでた
3618 2018-10-23 17:51:26 Only idiots can dream of better economy when for consecutive 4 years exports growth is in negative & imports going upward year on year @15%plus
Financial cost inflated to 23bln$ from 15bln$
Thanks2 low oil prices otherwise it was total collapse 
Pls don't mislead ppl
3619 2018-10-23 17:51:04 .@Mike_de_Jong calls @jjhorgan a "snake oil salesman" who "rides into town" with "election tonic" but won't provide crucial details on #PropRep to voters #bcpoli
3620 2018-10-23 17:50:48 Isn’t it strange that there are some people in #Pakistan still trying to find fault with the $3b #Saudi loan and deferred payment for oil supply. We can only pity their thought process. Well done @ImranKhanPTI @InsafPK
3621 2018-10-23 17:50:47 tae may leak ata sa kotse ko wala nanaman daw ako oil kakalagay ko lang boset
3622 2018-10-23 17:50:46 A little oil and some Hamon! Bring it on, Wamuu!
3623 2018-10-23 17:50:42 Breathing space for the PTI govt which inherited a Economic mess from the Sharif's & Its Munshis : KSA agrees to $3 billion loan  aswell as upto $3 billion deffered  payment facility for oil payments for Pakistan. 

By the way there were anti-Pak lobbies who were blocking this.
3624 2018-10-23 17:50:34 I couldn't tell which one was Chelsea.
3625 2018-10-23 17:50:32 Hold prices on 10 bottles of cooking oil? Industry was not able to meet demand and guarantee future availability of product. Poorly run and inefficient companies shud crash and burn... No regrets.
3626 2018-10-23 17:50:29 Trump exaggerates & lies about mostly inconsequential things.
Trump, however, has gotten more things done in his first 2 years than most in 4 & even SOME in 8.
If you believed any left bias "News" channel he is the reincarnation of Hitler himself.
Obama is a snake oil Salesman
3627 2018-10-23 17:50:18 Mike de Jong says Horgan reminds him of a 'snake oil salesman', says won't say what is in his 'election tonic'. This debate issue is sort of stupid because the debate will happen. But this QP has been highly entertaining. #bcpoli
3628 2018-10-23 17:50:13 He shouldn't like any milk. It is all white or white-ish. I'd offer him a glass of 
hot tar to be safe, or burning used motor oil.
3629 2018-10-23 17:50:11 On average (last 3 months prices) there is decrease of $2 or 2.5 / barrel, and in case of enhancing the oil production by KSA under tense circumstance would definitely leverage their stake to bring them out of crisis.
3630 2018-10-23 17:50:10 It gets me thinking too. Why would God gracious to some people and not gracious to others including believers.
I don't know.
Then I look at the lives of the apostle how they died ; some were put in a boiling oil, one was crucified upside down, John the Baptist was beheaded.
3631 2018-10-23 17:50:04 ty caelum！
3632 2018-10-23 17:50:00 If you're afraid of canola oil, use WD40.
3633 2018-10-23 17:49:54 If your man ain't rub coconut oil on him daily. Prosper my hoes .
3634 2018-10-23 17:49:52 USD 3 Billion in + oil on deferred payments from #SaudiArabia. What's the deal? Does @ImranKhanPTI agree to rent out 100K faujis to kill Yamani Muslims as quid pro quo?
3635 2018-10-23 17:49:50 Dubte ko tinke ka Sahara kafi. And hope with OIL ticking lower, this manage to float again..
3636 2018-10-23 17:49:46 Is it true that IMF does not entertain loan application from countries enjoying oil facility (deferred payment) ?
3637 2018-10-23 17:49:44 I say we take over Mexico,and its invading southern neighbors..they want to be in Our Country,we pay those countries, hell lets lay claim, all the companies going south would be ours again, tons of farmland,oil, resources they don't care about obviously @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews
3638 2018-10-23 17:49:43 patchouli is heavy and more of a perfumy smell we sometimes use it for when using soapnuts a drop in the wash just to give it a wee smell depends on what you like and sometimes lavender oil or lemon oil etc
3639 2018-10-23 17:49:39 All about hunting again.... not even trying to hide it anymore.  ConocoPhillips ??? So they pitched in a little cash so they get favorable lease terms to make billions on our oil while we collect pennies and @EPAAWheeler looks he other way with violations?... sigh.....
3640 2018-10-23 17:49:36 do u just rub the castor oil on ur brows??? they are thriving
3641 2018-10-23 17:49:31 Not following. Why do we want to confront Iran? Are we still pissed about the Shah thing? Are the Israelis in need of mobile dismemberment squads now? This isn't all about oil again, right?
3642 2018-10-23 17:49:28 The majo package of $6b Including $3b loan and three billion dollars oil deffered payment has testified Saudi Govt trust in policies of PM Imran Khan. It's also a loud message to opponents that PM has all abilities and skills to run Govt and take Pak out of inherited challenges.
3643 2018-10-23 17:49:28 Oil Tumbles 5% as Saudis Pledge to Produce as Much as They Can
3644 2018-10-23 17:49:23 Tweety says he prefers their oil production (so they can buy war toys)
3645 2018-10-23 17:49:22 Also maybe if we were better at using our resources more efficiently we wouldn't already be in this mess and a carbon tax wouldn't be necessary, but turns out when you make gas & oil cheap people just turn up the heat & drive SUVs, so now we get this.
3646 2018-10-23 17:49:20 私は治った
3647 2018-10-23 17:49:20 Saudi Arabia has agreed to provide Pakistan $3 billion in foreign currency support for a year to address its balance-of-payments crisis. The Kingdom has also agreed to provide Islamabad a one-year deferred payment facility for import of oil, worth up to another $3 billion.
3648 2018-10-23 17:49:13 Maybe it was a cobra liquor, and they just *thought* it was oil. O_e
3649 2018-10-23 17:49:13 全ての料理はオイルなしに作れない…(作れるのもあるかも、え、あるのかなぁ)
3650 2018-10-23 17:49:13 みゃおみゃはガンに効く
3651 2018-10-23 17:49:11 But remember that NLC wants more money for workers. Where do you want government to get funding for it? Government can't fund all salary from crude oil money. We need to do some "give me alms".
3652 2018-10-23 17:49:00 No need to contribute Bcos 10 rs petrol was higher from world mkt that will go to party fund from oil mkting companies. Poor India mango man keep standing in que.

3654 2018-10-23 17:48:45 I hate running adult errands. I will put off getting the oil changed in my car until it’s bone dry, then complain about my car not running right.
3655 2018-10-23 17:48:41 NSE Sector Indices: Of all the Industries on the NSE within our coverage, 4 sectors advanced in points while 2 sectors declined. The NSE sector indices that advanced in points were NSE PREMIUM (+1.48%), NSE 30 (+0.66%), NSE CONSUMER GOODS (+0.26%) and NSE OIL AND GAS (+0.13%)...
3656 2018-10-23 17:48:34 Congratulations everyone Pakistan gets much needed financial breather from Saudi Arabia. Three billion dollars for balance of payments and 3 billion dollars for deferred oil payments.#ImranKhan
3657 2018-10-23 17:48:22 oil spillage, freedom college, yam porridge. duncan mighty is the greatest of all time, my nigga.
3658 2018-10-23 17:48:20 It is time to cut off the saudi's.   Let them try to rule their kingdom and protect that oil without us.  We dont need them.  This is pretty sick.
3659 2018-10-23 17:48:18 No.  your right, his  answer was the identical  Trudeau, without the same info while not withholding the true costs... 

I do agree,  sure, same non answer, with a factual point that the west can do more influence economically speaking through reduction of Saudi Oil.
3660 2018-10-23 17:48:09 Remember how Smythe and his cronies all said the Kimmeridge was tight oil and wouldn't flow ! 

Egg on the fools faces now!
3661 2018-10-23 17:48:06 LMAO You don't know anything! Just so you know there's a port in Yabucoa where Shell and Sun Oil use to get delivered and where barges come in! Again you don't know what the hell you are talking about. Stick to football!  .... Blocked...
3662 2018-10-23 17:48:05 #Riyadh: Saudi Arabia will provide oil on differ payment to Pakistan for three years.
3663 2018-10-23 17:47:50 I can’t see how this messaging helps Alberta. If Ontario couldn’t sell their cars  at a feasible price we would wonder what was wrong with the cars.  She shouldn’t encourage the ROC to ask what is wrong with their oil.
3664 2018-10-23 17:47:49 Poor analysis.... there will be plenty affordable cooking oil on the market. No extra demand on forex.
3665 2018-10-23 17:47:49 Under whose regime did Ambani start oil business?
3666 2018-10-23 17:47:42 Is the U.S. or Canada suffering the same as Venezuela when OPEC decided to crush domestic American oil production?   Is it?
3667 2018-10-23 17:47:36 Get your oil changed
3668 2018-10-23 17:47:36 Next door, somebody is taking about ‘toxins’ while simultaneously blasting some godawful essential oil diffuser like it’s trench warfare.
3669 2018-10-23 17:47:32 Saudi Arabia Davos in the Desert - said set to sign deals worth more than $50 billion on opening day in oil, gas, industries & infrastructure sectors with firms such as Trafigura, Total, Hyundai, Norinco, Schlumberger, Halliburton and Baker Hughes.
3670 2018-10-23 17:47:21 Use coconut oil
3671 2018-10-23 17:47:08 Tried little nipple suctiony things as part of the evening, my hairy chest did not want to cooperate.  Science brain says that oil or some kind of fluid could help improve the seal, but shaving little hearts around my nipples does sound fun too
3672 2018-10-23 17:47:04 There is no forex in the bank so those who want forex have no choice but black market plus its a free market so I expect cooking oil to be cheaper in Zim than importing from Bots or SA
3673 2018-10-23 17:47:02 "crude oil shock", research its effect on inflation then invite me for a bottle of beer
3674 2018-10-23 17:46:28 WTH, I need to get alerts.   I changed my own oil and I charged myself more.
3675 2018-10-23 17:46:25 i dont have time for games come at my and i will destroy u, cross me and I will suck the life out of u with my explosive energy 
3676 2018-10-23 17:46:19 They like to shoot them. The only thing better than burning oil to a GOPr is killing endangered animals, stealing from the poor, raping women, molesting children and polluting the earth. They won’t be happy until this rare gem of a world looks like Venus.
3677 2018-10-23 17:46:17 I have “oil pruners” as a reminder and after reading that 20 times today it’s starting to sound not English

3679 2018-10-23 17:46:11 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
3680 2018-10-23 17:46:08 Safir- Please go on cnbc and say “ Since oil is going back to where it belongs, hopefully inflation will be in check for next few quarters. RBI may not raise interest rates since there will be no inflationary pressures” we need some positive messages on cnbc.. We only have u.
3681 2018-10-23 17:46:08 Working ppl always bear the brunt of economic injustice. This prop doesn't fix that. In fact, it keeps oil companies in the drivers seat of pricing. They will take that 12 cents that consumers have shown they will pay. Basic Econ. The result: gas prices stay the same, roads fail.
3682 2018-10-23 17:45:57 The importance of free flowing  oil on both wells cannot be emphasised enough #NOFRACKING required .
3683 2018-10-23 17:45:50 I wonder if the Carbon tax will apply to the foreign Oil imports into Canada as well. Considering the Canadian government looks at Uostream emission of Fossil Fuels. And those standards are far less than Canadian Standards
3684 2018-10-23 17:45:46 Full of inaccuracies. Tell me, on some of Westminster's financial working oil comes from an ' unknown source' Whisky and Gin are put through as UK not Scottish. You think we can't survive, England apparently subsidise us, why lie and cheat to keep us? #DissolveTheUnion
3685 2018-10-23 17:45:44 Oil and Gas!

they have no hope of cleaning a big dilbit spill even in calm waters...
3687 2018-10-23 17:45:40 Tried macadamia nut oil as an alternative to olive/sesame oil for my stir fry, and let me tell you, I’m in love! It’s better for you, TASTES 10x better, and has a higher smoke point than the alternatives 
3688 2018-10-23 17:45:40 his grandma told us she starts taking the liver oil every september and i was like  #protips and then i went home and started taking it
3689 2018-10-23 17:45:31 How can the good people of NEPA be so enamoured with these snake oil salesmen Trumps?....their policies are running this country into the ground and they are not concerned with the working people just getting your vote with lies. Their father is making us a laughingstock
3690 2018-10-23 17:45:21 Great stuff but it’s not really cruelty free if @Doveuk continue to use palm oil from vulnerable rain forests where orangutans are critically endangered.
3691 2018-10-23 17:45:19 Additionally, they wouldn't use palm oil in their products and contribute to deforestation and the destruction of wildlifes homes, but that's just something else they try to sweep under their blood stained rug

3693 2018-10-23 17:45:06 Here in California people are angry and sick at the possibility of more oil drilling off our beautiful coastline.  Will fight hard.  Trump, Zinke and the rest of them care NOTHING for the environment, only about $$$$
3694 2018-10-23 17:44:57 It's a significant proportion of the non oil income which they are only expecting to rise with the recent infrastructure investment and expansion of the haram.
3695 2018-10-23 17:44:56 Everyone's body reacts differently to CBD Oil than other's. If you take the drops that have 0% THC you should be fine.

3697 2018-10-23 17:44:49 @patagonia what do you guys know about the Taylor Oil Spill?

3702 2018-10-23 17:44:26 I can completely see where your going. If you are going to give it up try this out if you’d like and see if it may help. 
Milk thistle oil and Ashwagandha oil will help detox your liver and pancreas. In thw bigger picture you will end up getting drunk quicker
3703 2018-10-23 17:44:23 my lil oil diffusing pen comes in on thursday so i’m abt to sleep soooooo good thursday night im excited
3704 2018-10-23 17:44:20 That's the thing. They want a homogenized/hermetic sealed experience on all platforms. If there is any oil in the water then it's essential a extreme far right website.
3705 2018-10-23 17:44:14 kacey told me to get an oil change in her car today but i forgot where she told me to go 
3706 2018-10-23 17:44:13 Tickets and an oil change  ...wishing I was closer to that.! #Pennzoil #Vegas #MakeTheSwitch
3707 2018-10-23 17:44:12 We love this @DebaereUk @EatInEaling #eatshopbuyuselocal
3708 2018-10-23 17:44:11 No it wouldn't. We wouldn't need to use the land to grow crops to that extent. Also, you mentioned deforestation, which is virtually all a result of beef farming (and palm oil in Asia).
3709 2018-10-23 17:44:07 I'm a suburban college educated Conservative woman who can't be bought by a snake oil conman like Trump.  Trump lies he's giving tax cut.  The idiots who believe this don't realize the House originates tax legislation. They are out of session til after midterms.
3710 2018-10-23 17:44:01 A car pissed oil all down my neck
3711 2018-10-23 17:44:00 Nusarat sb. After one year we have to pay 6 billion dollars to SA,  from where we will pay?  What are conditions of deferred payment oil supply?
3712 2018-10-23 17:43:57  accidentally spilled tea tree oil on my shoes now I stank ugh

3714 2018-10-23 17:43:53 I guess this means buy the dip when looking at the RSI and MACD. Even though oil is down today, strong buy with this dividend, right?
3715 2018-10-23 17:43:42 my job is to squeeze the little fish livers to get the oil out
3716 2018-10-23 17:43:39 P.S. I voted for the 2000 Libertarian Presidential Candidate Harry Browne that year. I also accurately predicted that Bush would drag us back into a war w/Iraq for oil & to avenge Daddy, & bankrupt the nation, like he did in Oct. 2008.
3717 2018-10-23 17:43:37 Sir kuch Tau Aya hai na.  3 billion cash assistance plus 3 for oil on deferred payments.
3718 2018-10-23 17:43:29 Only things here that pay well are the coal mines or in the oil and gas industry.  Neither which intrigue me as a single father.  I appreciate the good vibes though <3
3719 2018-10-23 17:43:24 I forgot to tell the oil change guys my door doesnt open from the outside when they rolled up my windows... it is now pouring rain lmao woops
3720 2018-10-23 17:43:18 Indeed - I can understand the old days of  an album for £3:49 long gone but even with inflation and the rise in oil prices contributing it is aimed at collectors Just like Converse and tennis shoes used  to be cheap as soon as it becomes fashionable

3726 2018-10-23 17:43:00 Well done!!!! Imran khan oil import $3 billion on differed payment. 
@ImranKhanPTI thank you sir. 
InshaAllah will not go to the door step of  #IMF
3727 2018-10-23 17:42:59 Brent oil price fell to $76.22 / barrel today as Saudi Arabia guarantees to enhance its oil production & meet the shortfall caused by US sanctions of export of Iranian oil
3728 2018-10-23 17:42:59 Until companies move beyond their dependance on "data oil" into more sustainable and ethical business models, users will continue to be exploited because like real oil it's the most profitable resource to exploit.

3730 2018-10-23 17:42:54 Coconut oil all the time

3732 2018-10-23 17:42:33 Thank you I use Cantu coconut curling cream & Jamaican Black castor oil.
3733 2018-10-23 17:42:32 no it was all spent paying for the RBS and Halifax, wasn't it? besides good luck when the oil runs out
3734 2018-10-23 17:42:28 Peppermint lotion or anything peppermint..I have a peppermint oil and mix it with any lotion or just the oil it’s self. Hopefully that should work, works for me
3735 2018-10-23 17:42:24 Manufacturers @Busisa74 were trying. Demand has shot up and as we approach festive season this move is welcome. The sights of people pushing and shoving for cooking oil is just not right. Any1 with their money can now import for family or resale
3736 2018-10-23 17:42:21 1/2 Scotland paid well above its weight for many years before oil was even brought ashore. As an economist friend in the Treasury told me when asked can we go alone. “The economy will go up & down as per UK”.
A resource-rich country filling London’s coffers for pocket money.
3737 2018-10-23 17:42:16 midstream stocks getting pummelled today at 6 month lows probably some oil price algo thing

3745 2018-10-23 17:41:24 But papa. Why didn't your powers see that the cooking oil was going to be in short supply?
3746 2018-10-23 17:41:22 I agree with you. I don't care what Saudi Arabia does. I am tired of Democrats and Rhinos getting involved with foreign problems. 17 yrs in a war. Bring our troops home! It is all about money, oil, and poppy fields!
3747 2018-10-23 17:41:22 Does CNBC want to know real reasons? Think about this: Rapud increases in interest rate with more to come, oil has moved from $25.00 to a$50 plus per barrel, Saudi/ US future relationships uncertain especially as to Saudi oil production$100 oil?), inept dems possibly taking house

3761 2018-10-23 17:40:16 BC is not the only port in Canada that we could use to export our oil, seems to me our neighbors to the north are just as unhappy with the feds as we are. BC would also need to realize that we stand between them and the rest of Canada.

3805 2018-10-23 17:36:14 Yup, and looks like a c.$3m increase in cash today vs/ 20th September - at that rate (oil price dependent) you are looking at market cap being covered rather quickly!  Looks like one to accumulate on falls with #SQZ, #OPHR and #SIA.  These 4 are rock solid.
3806 2018-10-23 17:36:14 Businesses were always importing, nothing changes bt for the individuals who have brothers n sisters who cd send them were in a tight corner.

3807 2018-10-23 17:36:13 They have oil money.  We need to remember that the reason that they are in their privileged position because they have oil money.  A world where oil's power doesn't exist is a better world.
3808 2018-10-23 17:36:09 I'll take a pic or short video next time I wear it. It's really a great brand. I need to try the oil with it though. I haven't had the money to get it, but I plan to asap.
3809 2018-10-23 17:36:07 It is only intellectually deficient of one to claim thqt the oil industry has been sanitized but we are paying subsidy and the petrol price has soared instead of coming down.
3810 2018-10-23 17:36:06 It’s more of a loan deposit for 1 year to help Rs freefall and 3 yrs of deferred oil payments.

3812 2018-10-23 17:36:01 Why did Canada start selling arms to Saudis in first place? Because military spending by US & NATO partners was down. So we turned to whoever would buy. Same fundamental Qs w/ oil: what do we expect when dependant on industries that harm people & planet? How can we change? #cdnfp

3828 2018-10-23 17:34:53 The ones that say it isn't either get paid by a GOP think tank or the oil company's! They ran the same play book with cigarette smoking and leaded gasoline.
3829 2018-10-23 17:34:48 They Gvt shld just let them look for their USD let the procurement be open like they have done on cooking oil and other commodities
3830 2018-10-23 17:34:47 Unfortunately, US and EU will prove that oil is worth more than a lifetime. They will continue to do business with murderers
3831 2018-10-23 17:34:35 Cleansing oil and facial oil is a different. Cleansing oil utk cuci makeup. Facial oil gune utk fine wrinkles and aging.
3832 2018-10-23 17:34:35 Mind you I have absolutely no compulsions against the likes of Sequoia and Temasek being played for fools and their holdings going on to being a retirement fund for guys like Alvarez who've paid their dues twicefold.

But the snake oil salesmen who run the show need a comeuppance
3833 2018-10-23 17:34:34 So snake oil has medicinally properties, and the false peddling of medicine as snake oil that in fact did not contain snake oil is what lead to snake oil’s association with deceptive marketing. It’s a lot like (insert comparison to something politically relevant).
3834 2018-10-23 17:34:32 The unseen 1,000 per day crossing illegally now dont scare people.  The optics of one weeks worth marching en mass does. 
El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua over 40 million people just in those 4 countries. So when is enough, how many?
3835 2018-10-23 17:34:30 I doubt United Refineries has control on how cooking oil reaches the user unless they have their own outlets. Retailers will do what’s best for their business operations. Unfortunately.
3836 2018-10-23 17:34:25 Science vs Scientism: For decades, the lines of distinction have been blurred between the 2 & brilliantly conflated an concocted into a very appealing Snake Oil. There is a huge number of buyers. You & yours have a few years to sell more. It will be exhilarating for all, briefly.
3837 2018-10-23 17:34:24 He's making a clear and concise point and you understand, he's addressed a true menace from a very sincere acumen of view.

3849 2018-10-23 17:33:22 Oil is just there as an optical trick - the idea is to match the refractive index of the glass i.e. it looks prettier.
3850 2018-10-23 17:33:15 Invest in Saudi Oil. Let’s support dictatorships. It’s the NDP way.
3851 2018-10-23 17:33:14 You keep saying hippies like it is a bad thing. Thanks to the legalization of pot, Alberta is going to be the hippy capital of the world. Fast oil money and pot. When that happens, you UCP types need to have your bags packed at #ableg, because your days are limited. (Wink)

3853 2018-10-23 17:33:00 Oil producing companies are not managing the demand is high and they r producing less especially at a time like this. Allow pple to go and shop for oil in the neighbouring countries. Those who cnt travel will buy frm the local shops, those who can wil bring boxes, less pressure
3854 2018-10-23 17:32:54 Now imagine if the northerners owns Nigeria crude oil.
3855 2018-10-23 17:32:47 You’re right in your thinking. We were there until closing...we were the customers we hate! But hey, Chand got a nice plant pot and I got argan oil hand soap amongst other stuff 
3856 2018-10-23 17:32:45 CHRISTIAN. So you know he’s automatically against new ideas, he in fact wanted to make the first manned rocket with wood and oil.
3857 2018-10-23 17:32:40 I can go for hours without a phone call, but as soon as my hands are full of oil or grease or I’m in the shower my phone rings....every time

3859 2018-10-23 17:32:35 If you pour olive oil all over it and shut the door on one sleeve then spin round really really quickly so you are facing the other way the jumper might stay put so alleviating the situation
3860 2018-10-23 17:32:34 Again. We are not the US government. We simply track oil that goes from point A to point B. Those who say they know more, are speaking so from hindsight in order to compensate what they missed in their tracking.
3861 2018-10-23 17:32:33 Oil field money 
3862 2018-10-23 17:32:32 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.

3864 2018-10-23 17:32:15 especially if you count oil we sell.
3865 2018-10-23 17:32:09 Package is of 12b dollar overall. 3b dollar oil for three yeara and 3b dollar cash.
3866 2018-10-23 17:32:03 I’ve looked up the tea tree oil one it says to call poison control lmao but I’m alive!

3869 2018-10-23 17:31:44 "The government continues to grovel for the hands-outs from the oil industry. It's disgusting, disgraceful and shameful," said Grand Chief Stewart Phillip of @UBCIC at a press conference of opponents who say the new NEB process is more flawed than the last. @NatObserver

3872 2018-10-23 17:31:39 It is probably the main reason.. before they struck oil, most of Arabia simply had no means of cremating a body.. (they burned what they could, including a famous episode where the chopped off head of a chief w long hair was used to cook food by Khalid Bin Waleed's soldiers)
3873 2018-10-23 17:31:37 also use olive oil to cook with has 120 calories per tablespoon adn avacoados jsut half is 160 calories with whole grain bread make a sandwhich thats almost 300 calories right there , snack on nuts and dark chocolate as well(trail mix)

3877 2018-10-23 17:31:09 @Chellaney Riyadh will not pay for sure. First look into their trillions of dollars investment in US and a single trillion dollar & worlds largest oil company.
3878 2018-10-23 17:31:08 Oil down to $76 per barrel...rand doing better....so fuel price SHOULD come down next month right?
3879 2018-10-23 17:31:06 Remember the days when it was Bush, Cheney, Haliburton, and all their oil cronies fault for the gas prices? Good times man. Good times
3880 2018-10-23 17:31:04 I found something today that you and your co-workers might like at my local dollar general, it is called roll-on aromaguru in tea tree oil and lavender oil aromatherapy. love,vanessa.
3881 2018-10-23 17:31:04 That's alot of daddies for an oil can...
3882 2018-10-23 17:31:03 When God is moving in your ministry for his Glory make sure your in alignment and sowing into it the blessing and oil will trickle down to you.
3883 2018-10-23 17:31:00 Logging the rainforests to make way for Palm Oil is what is destroying the climate but I get your gist. At least you're a reformed repetitive World traveller, so you're doing your bit
3884 2018-10-23 17:31:00 That reminds me.. Time to put PIL that pouring oil on Hanuman murti and Shani Murti impacts environment! @CasesPending Sir.. Please opine!

3886 2018-10-23 17:30:56 The issue is to punish  the Saudis. or send a message that their brutal behavior won't be tolerated. Not put Canadians out of work over some perception of morality. Cancelling the contract won't hurt the Saudis. Not buying their oil would.
3887 2018-10-23 17:30:55 Why bother, you'll never be able to match the dollars in bribe money paid to the previous SaskParty leader, or the party to keep Big Oil in charge around here.
3888 2018-10-23 17:30:53 BABY OIL?! AHHHHHHH!
3889 2018-10-23 17:30:53 Oil's down. Apparently, SA will have to sell more oil to fund itself. When consumers care about moral behavior, economics leads to moral behavior. It's a good thing.
3890 2018-10-23 17:30:42 6 billion and 3 billion oil for 3 years
3891 2018-10-23 17:30:34 Have set up with the oil giants? Do you know the companies who’s brass plaque is in England pay their taxes direct to Westminster? Do you know that GB is £2 trillion in debt and not £1 of that was spent in Scotland? You simply have no clue.

One more lease of life for hub of terrorism.
3894 2018-10-23 17:30:22 And Nazis is the National Socialist German Workers Party. So playing your word game. Sanders is a Nazi. The United Oil workers are Nazis. The National Basketball Association is Nazi. Wait best one Democratic National Committee. This is fun.
3895 2018-10-23 17:30:21 NO Kushners family just happen to have a close relationship with the Saudis. But nobody really cares about that because of all that oil.
3896 2018-10-23 17:30:17 Oil change is due what you got on it  sis ?????

3899 2018-10-23 17:30:04 Saudi Arabia will provide Balance of Payment support and deferred oil payment facility to Pakistan. Whereas Saudi Arabia will get to build an oil refinery in Gwadar and possible control of Rekodiq. Balochistan card used by Federal govt to get Saudi help.1/2
3900 2018-10-23 17:29:59 There's GMA with Michael Strahan with a hard hitting interview with Jane Fonda at the oil change place and what I'm trying to say is 38-7.
3901 2018-10-23 17:29:44 ノルマのないこのみさんラウンジとかありませんかね
3902 2018-10-23 17:29:44 There is a difference between lessening one's use of oil & getting serious about climate change. Linking them together is not a valid argument, there is no definitive causation proof. For every study that says... There is one that says... People use to promote fear mongering.
3903 2018-10-23 17:29:38 If you get a chance, see if anyone that lives around you has a true edible made with true oil...
I have a feeling you got a bunk product
3904 2018-10-23 17:29:38 It's close to impossible to have a flat stomach in this our country 
Seeing that light brown soft kenkey,backed with fresh hot  multicolored pepper topped with out of the  oil fried crunchy fish,onion dopped fried egg, sardine and square cute avocado 

People it's hard
3905 2018-10-23 17:29:36 It's like mayo with dill and more oil and a lil bit more sour....
3906 2018-10-23 17:29:36 baby oil and musty underarms...
3907 2018-10-23 17:29:21 yes but oil slick purple
3908 2018-10-23 17:29:17 Hopefully prices won't plunge back to 25 again by that time, with literally everyone wanting to add more oil into the market.
3909 2018-10-23 17:29:14 Who are you pointing fingers at? Are you suggesting (wrongly) that the Fed Govt buys Saudi oil? Or are you pointing fingers at private companies?  Please be specific as you are obscuring the issue.
3910 2018-10-23 17:29:07 “I find it amazing the Prime Minister doesn’t take responsibility forfuture generations and doesn’t understand the the climate and the environment do not go hand in hand” @ubcic Grand Chief Stewart Phillip “Trudeau Govt continues to grovel for the handouts of the oil industry”
3911 2018-10-23 17:29:02 PM @JustinTrudeau doesn't understand that env't and economy do not go hand in hand, they are diametrically opposed, says Grand Chief Stewart Phillip. Gov't is "hand in glove" with big oil, groveling for handouts, he says. #cdnpoli

3913 2018-10-23 17:28:49 Well... when I was in school, I was always taught that it was tar sands...When my former father inlaw worked on the financing of projects it was always tar sands.  Oil sands is just marketing spin.
3914 2018-10-23 17:28:49 If @Tesla doubled production, it would (eventually) completely eliminate America's  dependence on oil from Saudi Arabia. 6M cars * 9% = 540k; Tesla production = 320k
3915 2018-10-23 17:28:47 Petroleum products are not the problem. BURNING oil and fossil fuels is what causes Green house gases. We can continue to use those products without damaging the planet to the extent we are now. But we HAVE to stop burning fossil fuels. There really is no choice here.
3916 2018-10-23 17:28:45 I’m supposed to be getting an oil change and I got this man pulling up cars 
3917 2018-10-23 17:28:45 Tea tree oil :-)
3918 2018-10-23 17:28:37 I will fear no evil, for you ARE with me, your rod and your staff, they comfort me. You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil, my cup overflows.

3929 2018-10-23 17:27:46 3 billion dollar in cash. 3 billion dollar oil ka. Total 6.
3930 2018-10-23 17:27:46 Same here and it just cost  $600.00 for heating oil today. It is unseasonably cold here and need heat. I'M 70. Hoping winter will not be a long one.
3931 2018-10-23 17:27:33 I used to mix jojoba oil in my lotion lol. You’re the 1 millionth person I know that said to add sweet almond oil I just dk where to get any 
3932 2018-10-23 17:27:32 Exactly. People with vast amounts of money can't make much more in a stable economy. Currency fluctuations, gold prices, oil prices, deregulation of taxes and employee regulations etc. Keep them all in flux, grow the wealth and blame foreigners, Corbyn and disabled People!
3933 2018-10-23 17:27:29 Oil Prices rose back above $80 a barrel before dropping slightly, as markets were expected to tighten once U.S. sanctions against Iran’s crude exports are implemented next month.
3934 2018-10-23 17:27:26 I mean, AD15 is where the Black Panther Party was founded, where the Free Speech Movement happened, where the country's most successful Green/Democrat progressive alliance operates in local politics and has dealt multiple defeats to one of the world's largest oil companies.
3935 2018-10-23 17:27:17 No. That is not what is being preached by Pakatan Harapan before. Nothing about US, Fed rates, oil price. No, no, no. Everything is about kleptocracy.
3936 2018-10-23 17:27:12 Mr president if we raise corporate tax rate to 30% at least and cut unnecessary spending we can reduce trillion s in 4 to 5 years !and with VENEZUELA a low price on oil with difference in a large tax the US CAN ALSO accumulate TRILLIONS IN 4 TO 5 YEARS!
3937 2018-10-23 17:27:12  she needs oil to loosen up the joints 
3938 2018-10-23 17:27:08 Of the Russian puppets must do their masters bidding . Putin needs conflict in the Middle East to raise oil prices and to move weapons
3939 2018-10-23 17:26:54 It will Jack up OiL Prices.
3940 2018-10-23 17:26:50 Especially the kind from restaurants they serve you for free with butter and olive oil. Mmmmmm.
3941 2018-10-23 17:26:47 Yes, I’ve used lavender oil in a diffuser for my anxious child for years and it definitely helps, especially at night.
3942 2018-10-23 17:26:38 And this problem is mitigated by the economic advantages green energy initiatives afford. Outstrip traditional energy investment opportunities by a factor of 10 and employs more people NOW than oil and gas. The US is ostensibly the only hold-out on this. EU, China, all on board
3943 2018-10-23 17:26:38 Well actually thee are so many visuals of animals and fishes dead from swallowing plastics and oil spills ...... what are you going to do about that ....
3944 2018-10-23 17:26:38 Scheer is planning to demand that refineries in the east only buy oil from where he says they can buy oil from?  How's that going to work?
3945 2018-10-23 17:26:35 Kana why do we call cooking oil -> fish oil?
3946 2018-10-23 17:26:33 Tonight, I didn't neglect putting coconut oil on my skin.

3948 2018-10-23 17:26:03 We've discussed before how it's always been about the oil, since the early 20th century.
3949 2018-10-23 17:25:59 Now y’all just making stuff up. I might as well say palm oil and corn flakes
3950 2018-10-23 17:25:55 I fully regret not eating before bringing my car in for an oil change. It's been an hour lmaooo I'm never coming back here
3951 2018-10-23 17:25:43 If the caravan had oil, Trump and his administration would say helping them is our responsibility. Since they're just people and all they have are their lives, they're a burden.

3955 2018-10-23 17:25:22 History also suggests oil crashes in bear mkt. Mkt rallied fr 4 years now it's time for consolidation. 
My view
3956 2018-10-23 17:25:22 Yes true, but @dianesbaker1 is correct. It was about controlling the oil, &  Cheney, for one, wanted Halliburton to benefit the most.
3957 2018-10-23 17:25:19 No need. There are enough refineries in the west to supply Canadians. Irving mainly refines Saudi oil for the American east coast.
3958 2018-10-23 17:25:18 That is good you are ok are you using a cast iron skillet did you use olive oil because olive oil heated up real fast
3959 2018-10-23 17:25:11 Likely they would be shot.
Here, they will be processed and let in.
The resources offered them in many different forms far exceeds any forigen aid and will go directly to them and not Honduran gov

3963 2018-10-23 17:25:03 Forgive me, but if a Govt swallows $38.7M of tax revenues on home heating costs (mostly oil in #PEI homes), what incentives does a population have to move away from oil heat? Economic carrots become much more appealing when there's a decent-sized stick involved too #peipoli

3970 2018-10-23 17:24:18 #oilprices falling showed #realdonaldtrump is handling the #SaudiArabia crisis correctly as Saudi is now flooding the market with oil - Oil is now down to $66 from $75 just a few weeks ago.  While #cnn was hyperventilating, the President was calm and reacted accordingly.
3971 2018-10-23 17:24:10 Absolutely agree as most tradesmen cherish good equipment. I have all my late grandads hand tools he used into his 90s he used to oil all the wooden shafts and keep the metal spotless. Even today better quality than many tools on market.
3972 2018-10-23 17:24:08 It’s quite simple really Graham, the rest of the world should ban all sales and imports to the Gulf states and see if they can eat oil ? I’m pretty sure they’ll run out of dates pretty quickly ? 
3973 2018-10-23 17:24:00 hmmmmmmm i want a new face cream from lush but everything the lady gave me samples for yesterday has almond oil and/or almond milk in it and idk i know its lush but :/// i can never get over how much water it takes to grow almonds its terrible

3979 2018-10-23 17:23:38 Farm machinery can run on electricity too. In China they have buses with a range of 1000 kilometres and are replacing diesel buses so fast it’s affecting the global demand for oil.
3980 2018-10-23 17:23:36 There’s a pattern emerging that shines like the bat symbol above Gotham.  Trump is anti-red tape, except when it comes to voting rights where he vehemently checks every comma of a dem. Trump is anti-muslim except when it comes to murderous Arab despots sitting on oil fortunes.

3983 2018-10-23 17:23:21 Btw did Sir @KlasraRauf approve $3 billion deposits and oil on credit offer from KSA?
3984 2018-10-23 17:23:20 When you see what Saudi Arabia has used oil money to do, i sometimes wonder if Nigeria is selling groundnut oil.
3985 2018-10-23 17:23:08 Any makeup with oil in it (pressed powders and anything liquid). Generally, 3-5 years is the expiration. If it helps, I like to clean and keep the containers for craft projects (to hold small items or to repurpose into decor).
3986 2018-10-23 17:23:04 The cooking oil manufacturers were abusing the advantage of protection from competition. Let them close they have no business senses
3987 2018-10-23 17:22:56 Better off having @Castrol GTX to oil up that dome.
3988 2018-10-23 17:22:55 Love the @KVossNYC Lip Balm in Strawberry Peppermint that I got in my October @ipsy bag! It's not too sticky, with a texture more like an oil than a thick balm. The scent is divine. And my lips feel plumped and healthy. #makeup #maquillage #beauty #beauté #ipsy #KVossNYC

3991 2018-10-23 17:22:13 Definitely for oil, Trump want to invest in machinery and technology for oil extraction to pump more oil.

3993 2018-10-23 17:22:06 Cancelled due to keystone approval and lack of business case, oil was for export 80% of it, so facts important here and Scheer should be pushed on presenting bs as facts, also ignoring his govt signed deal difficult to cancel, and Scheer approve tabling in HoC so we can see?
3994 2018-10-23 17:22:04 This 
And also coconut oil! 
3995 2018-10-23 17:22:01 no liquor straight oil
3996 2018-10-23 17:21:58 Need to get an oil change soon
3997 2018-10-23 17:21:55 The West to stop buying their oil

4001 2018-10-23 17:21:35 Go ahead and ask me anything, I'm waiting for an oil change so I'll be here a while.
4002 2018-10-23 17:21:32 That’s fine once we get our oil to port we will bypass the US. There is a whole world market out there! There will be more refineries build as well. Our economy will be strong without          free loaders!
4003 2018-10-23 17:21:30 You can't answer? Well, maybe you grew up in an environment that elevates thieving but where I'm from, such people are lazy crooks. They no longer exist in the oil industry
4004 2018-10-23 17:21:29 1. 3 billion in deposits for 1 Year
2. Year 1- Oil import worth $3B with deffered payment of 1 Year
3. Year 2- Oil import worth $3B with deffered payment of 1 Year
4. Year 3- Oil import worth $3B with deffered payment of 1 Year
4005 2018-10-23 17:21:27 US putting sanctions on Iran on behalf of Israeli demands, only increases the Saudi oil muscle over the US.

4007 2018-10-23 17:21:18 Yes, update is a good idea because I sold some stocks late september. $ESV $RIG $SLB $CVE $VET $GAZPy and just today I bought so much $BTE  I’m still throwing up... and of course down -2% already #oil #OOTT #energy
4008 2018-10-23 17:21:10 Ouch! Someone told me about the book not long ago
4009 2018-10-23 17:21:01 I said FDR 2nd Bill of Rights sounds like the old Russian Communist system. Socialism is in parts of Europe. And in even parts of the US. Norway has a lot of Socialism, but they get a lot of their $ from Oil. Which many here would be against.
4010 2018-10-23 17:20:59 funny how just a few weeks ago it was announced that the largest investment in the oil industry for years.
4011 2018-10-23 17:20:57 What would be the implications of approaching the US about replacing Saudi oil with US oil?  Surely, adding some extra demand to the north American supply/demand ratio would help Canadian oil prices.  Or am I being naïve here?
4012 2018-10-23 17:20:41 "USD 3 Billion"
More PTI Retweeted PTI
In addition to USD 3 billion deposit,  it has also been agreed that a one year deferred payment facility for import of oil, up to USD 3 Billion, will be provided by Saudi Arabia to Pakistan. @PTIofficial
4013 2018-10-23 17:20:38 Plus oil refinery
4014 2018-10-23 17:20:36 Well yeah, because if we piss them off, they sell the oil to Russia. The West's reliance on oil is the only thing keeping us on friendly terms with KSA
4015 2018-10-23 17:20:34 And they sold ISIS oil for them so there is that.
4016 2018-10-23 17:20:30 Why isn’t anybody talking about the Taylor Co. Oil spill that has been leaking for years...

4018 2018-10-23 17:20:12 Have you heard of oil pulling?
4019 2018-10-23 17:20:11 I like to grip my partners so can't really do that if they all slippery. I would ask about their kinks and go from there whether that means we're getting toys or accessories or outfits or role-playing or w/e. Also baby oil would mask their smell and I need that.
4020 2018-10-23 17:20:08 Why dont you lying right wingers tell the truth about Venezula.They are suffering do to the U.S.punishing them for not allowing big oil to takeover their oil reserves you lying pricks.Its got zero to do with social policies.Also Canada is a capitalist/socialist nation.u lie..
4021 2018-10-23 17:20:07 i have a bottle of oil from the store. its 10.3mg/ml. i was thinking id make a mug cake, put a ml in with the melted butter, make cake as usual, then split it in quarters and try eating em like an hour apart?
4022 2018-10-23 17:20:01 @realDonaldTrump I was very bothered to return to these sanctions and I have a right to ask for anything in this regard. Breaking all our troubles will ruin you and it will not be tolerated. We will never be short, our future will depend on the full boycott of oil
4023 2018-10-23 17:20:00 I used to give my daughter Slowmag, Evening Primrose oil and Royal 6. ( Vit B combination). Helped for pain and moodiness.

4025 2018-10-23 17:19:55 1. Cash Deposit of 3 billion USD for one year
2. Deferred oil payments worth 3 billion USD per year, for three years.

Total = 3 billion + (3*3 billion) = 12 billion USD
4026 2018-10-23 17:19:52 Indeed sir, however gvt should focus on other innovative ideas like manufacturing Neem product (oil, pest etc), black chicken farming (Kadaknath) and fish/boiler farming, orange/grape farming. Organic products r in demand

4029 2018-10-23 17:19:47 You oil it very infrequently because the oil bonds molecularly with the metal and creates a nonstick surface. However, new ones come pre-seasoned and, should you need to season it, you just rub the whole thing down w/ canola, wipe off the excess and bake it at 500 for a few hours

4036 2018-10-23 17:19:24 Its alot of what if. Like what if the 95% of oceans that arent discovered are the main reason this planet is going to shit due these oil spills and pollution. If we knew more we’d learn to make things better. No time to be clueless we boutta die!

4051 2018-10-23 17:18:04 These guys at the oil change spot better hook me up with some type of discount along with the amount of friendliness they're throwing my way.
4052 2018-10-23 17:18:03 Thank you for your reply. Only just read it - for some reason I didn’t get the notification of your reply until just now. I will certainly look into the oil and actually do have Diazepam prescribed, but nervous (ironically!) about taking it. Very good to hear your experiences....
4053 2018-10-23 17:18:02 That's what you don't understand. Shorts don't hate Tesla, they look for a certain setup (like longs do... Undervalued, growth, ect.). If the fundamentals change, I (and most of my bearish friends) go away. It's not something funded by big oil, some conspiracy to harm Elon.
4054 2018-10-23 17:18:01 It’ll be interesting to see US oil inventory data.

4064 2018-10-23 17:17:01 Instead of putting 2000 Canadian workers out of work, which won't hurt the Saudis. Lets look at common sense solutions such as stop buying Saudi oil. Canada has oil. Canadians own a pipeline.

4069 2018-10-23 17:16:24 Thanks to KSA for giving bail out package to Pakistan. This will lesson some worries of IK govt as oil payments deferred. But as a nation we need to bring discipline in all walks of life.
4070 2018-10-23 17:16:23 is everybody ready for winter...ive been taking cod liver oil since the beginning of october and people are impressed by this when i tell them.....
4071 2018-10-23 17:16:22 In Nigerian context the overly dependence on revenue from oil as not really encouraged other sector and importantly agriculture. There is much more government needs to do especially policy implementation.
4072 2018-10-23 17:16:20 So, logically, it would be “staggering hypocrisy” for a fossil fuel company to promote its own line of solar panels and wind turbines while continuing to sell oil.  And it would be “staggering hypocrisy” for a junk food company to promote a new line of health foods...

Saudi Arabia is not going to do anything to the talent 
If they do US will replace them and the only reason this has gone mainstream because US want Saudi to do something for them
Either they want prince replaced
This bad publicity can push the oil prices down

4099 2018-10-23 17:14:08 Spending hundreds of millions on things like solvents to increase oil production when there is no pipeline capacity and a $15 a barrel price is incredibly wasteful. Carbon tax and all associated programs need to be scrapped until pipelines are built.

But right now i'm using jojoba and sweet almond.. I don't like the jojoba on my skin by itself. It absorbs too quickly if that makes sense

The money comes in while many countries & firms reconsider their ties with #KSA over murder of Saudi journalist.
4114 2018-10-23 17:13:08 Crude oil could work its way back to 200 day which comes in at $67.40--but its going to take some bullish news to get significantly above that again this year IMO --#OOTT #crudeoil --refiners in maintenance season meaning supplies of crude will continue to build
4115 2018-10-23 17:12:54 Exfoliate once a week to scrub off dead cells that make skin look dull. When skin is freshly exfoliated, lotion and oil are better absorbed.
4116 2018-10-23 17:12:50 great, now do coconut oil
4117 2018-10-23 17:12:44 In case PM gets as much from China ($3b) for one year it is possible to avert IMF completely. My understanding: The Fund does not entertain loan application from countries enjoying oil facility (deferred payment).

4125 2018-10-23 17:12:20 Wow!! Now if we could get them to stop using oil.....
4126 2018-10-23 17:12:18 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.

4128 2018-10-23 17:12:07 its very unfortunate but zainab we know this is the game of oil and machines. the poor are just exploited like pests in poor countries. Lord is Qahaar, He will take full account of these evil actions.

4139 2018-10-23 17:11:05 Try infusing the olive oil with energizing herbs such as Rhodiola Root, Ginseng Root, Schizandra Berry, Codonopsis Root, Guarana Seed, Kola Nut, or Yerba Mate Leaf.
4140 2018-10-23 17:11:00 Countries producing high USD trade surpluses (China, Japan, Switzerland, Germany, South Korea....) cannot use these dollars to buy Treasuries, but have to pay their oil bills, mostly in USD. This changes global capital flows out of US Treasuries when oil is high= housing crash.
4141 2018-10-23 17:10:59 Understand supply of trucks/pots and driver regulations are part of price, but trucks run on oil.  Isn’t the oil market trending lower?
4142 2018-10-23 17:10:58 You won’t regret it. I just slather on coconut oil in the shower bc it’s quick bc I’m lazy then I get out & put on Shea butter lol ; I need to try that. What do you mix with ?

4144 2018-10-23 17:10:52 I would be delirious if Cheeseman knocks Fowler out. Send him and his CBD oil home packing!
4145 2018-10-23 17:10:48 Importing billions of dollars of oil every year from nations with zero enviromental policies is a smart enviromental policy??
4146 2018-10-23 17:10:39 Probiotics, fish oil. None of it does anything. My brief foray into supplements is over.
4147 2018-10-23 17:10:39 Those going gaga over "why do you blame hindu festivals only" and are so concerned about preserving the culture should know that deepawali means to light deeps with mustard oil or pure ghee, which purifies the air, so lets not pollute it with crackers #SayNoToCrackers

4155 2018-10-23 17:10:03 Saw a thread of black owned body butter... does anyone know a black owned body care company? I need something with NO COCOA BUTTER or COCONUT OIL though (Yes I know. ) My skin doesn’t agree with those things..
4156 2018-10-23 17:09:58 This doesn’t mean they will sell cheap, oil trading at $81 a barrel raised from 26$, the buying cost has to be passed on to the consumers.
4157 2018-10-23 17:09:47 If the federal government was so worried about climate change then they would be taxing imports & exports from India, China & Russia, Saudi Oil instead of giving carbon exemption to Chevron & Irving oil & taxing its citizens won’t effect our country climate
4158 2018-10-23 17:09:42 Grandnute oil join?
4159 2018-10-23 17:09:28 Cut the oil!!!!
4160 2018-10-23 17:09:18 Please stop giving your pets CBD oil.
4161 2018-10-23 17:09:16 I don't think I'm optimistic. Just grimly refusing to despair prematurely. 

And like you, pouring my little bottle of oil on troubled waters wherever I see panic.
4162 2018-10-23 17:09:02 I have used both balm and pre-shave oil..I find that when shaving with a good soap and a properly set up razor both are unnecessary - I do sometimes still use balm though because I enjoy the cooling effect! Get @str8razors to set up your straight and you’ll never have an issue.
4163 2018-10-23 17:09:02 USD 3 Billion in account + USD 3 Billion in oil deferred payments will surely be breather for Pakistan. 

#ThankyouSaudiArabia and #ThankYouImranKhan
4164 2018-10-23 17:08:59 What Tories mean by  "because there's no alternative to fossil fuels" is that they have no interest in alternative technologies while their oil company buddies are still pumping out C02 and failing to pay their corporate taxes ?
4165 2018-10-23 17:08:51 Norway has loads of oil and they operate on the nordic model. They're not socialist.
4166 2018-10-23 17:08:46 It's like, what, more peopel are employed in renewables then oil in Canada? More people work at arby's then coal in the US? Tax cuts in the US led to harley davidson shipping to south korea? Sorry, india.

4171 2018-10-23 17:08:36 One of my youth just tried to get me to teach him how to make oil for 20 minutes . Boa was persistent about it
4172 2018-10-23 17:08:34 The same trend he wanted to end by removing the subsidy. 
Your MCM and his cronies blocked Lagos and were doing Shaku Shaku in the name of protest. 
He has increased the price for the oil and is paying the same subsidy.
4173 2018-10-23 17:08:31 Not for brain health, but I think I remember hearing some promising benefits to that. I think the MCT nature of coconut oil can give a bit of a metabolism boost, though.
4174 2018-10-23 17:08:23 Ten cuidado con ese megatonto del Paulo no sabe del tema. Tienes razón Pemex importa petróleo por el simple hecho que no lo produce,  en 6 años no se invirtió un quinto. La reforma energética fue una reforma ex profeso para distribución del Shale Oil americano.

So total of $12 Bn

4182 2018-10-23 17:07:27 They *do* have some oil reserves down there ....
4183 2018-10-23 17:07:27 Oil companies are neither nasty nor beneficent. They are businesses looking to make a profit. 
Taxes are a way to drive r&d as the businesses work to minimize that tax. We all benefit.
4184 2018-10-23 17:07:17 Lol it’s okay my car dealership does everything for me. I can check my oil and change a tire tho
4185 2018-10-23 17:07:16 We could just annex their oil fields.

making the dangers of drilling for oil off our shores acceptable by never informing us of the repeated spills

Farmers owning a piece of infrastructure to help add value to their Ag operations & also diversify into other revenue generating opportunities is a way to negate & hedge against the capacity issues you imply.
4226 2018-10-23 17:04:30 Did you know those nasty oil companies are often in the lead on r&d? Add to their costs and see what happens. Trudeau wanted the money in Ottawa complete with gst tacked on. Sask said no. That 90%rebate was known to the premiers. Now the public know only 90% goes back
4227 2018-10-23 17:04:25 I can only say Std Oil was subject to our anti-trust laws; China is not. So while the monopolization of a certain market might be analogous, the available remedies are not.

I contend tariffs never work. Anywhere. Economics is like any other physical sci. Its laws are immutable.

4244 2018-10-23 17:02:56 Well Done PM Imran Khan! Oil import of $3 billion worth on deferred payment for three years from Saudi Arabia and additional USD 3 billion to be parked in the Pakistan's National Treasury for 1 year by KSA. This will provide breathing space for sure #FutureInvestmentInitiative

4246 2018-10-23 17:02:38 Getting my oil changed today and I sat a chair away from this old mans wife and he goes “is it okay if I sit in between you two princesses here?” Old people can be so sweet 
4247 2018-10-23 17:02:38 How much credit is tied indirectly to the price of crude? Oil complex and its huge debts may prove a problem for your thesis. We'll see
4248 2018-10-23 17:02:31 If the federal government was so worried about climate change then they would be taxing imports & exports from India, China & Russia, Saudi Oil instead of giving carbon exemption to Chevron & Irving oil & taxing its citizens.
4249 2018-10-23 17:02:20 Just had the most irritating sales call ever. Asked for someone else then proceeded to tell me it’s fine as it’s not a personal call. Started asking me questions about Italian food and trying to sell me olive oil, while denying she was doing a survey or selling anything.

4255 2018-10-23 17:02:00 Dept of Trans estimates at an avg mileage of 25 mpg, a single #EV can displace about 468 gallons of gas per yr, or 25 Barrels of #oil
With our #EV I think I calculated we displace 32 barrels of oil!

4260 2018-10-23 17:01:45 UK and USA not going to do anything as they want Saudi money trade and their oil. If history seves me right didn't we were ti scared to challenge Hitler in the 1930s and look what he went on and accomplished !!
4261 2018-10-23 17:01:44 it's his way of paying back the dough he spent on the oil line .....
4262 2018-10-23 17:01:43 Because of oil we have  a better standard of Living, longer life span, clean water, clean air, A house, a car, schools, and better “MEDICATION”   Denying this standard of living to our children and grandchildren is to send them back into the pass where living was harsh.

4274 2018-10-23 17:01:20 Yesss. I mix Tea Tree oil in my witch hazel & use an oil mixture on my face. Folks that say it doesn’t aren’t taking all the correct steps 
4275 2018-10-23 17:01:19 I need to learn how to do my own damn oil change 
4276 2018-10-23 17:01:17 I told my friend the other day I’d rather pay $5 a gallon than buy their oil.
4277 2018-10-23 17:01:13 If you want your car to last a long time, changing the oil regularly is necessary. The lubrication from the oil protects the internal parts of your engine. Keeping your engine in top shape allows your car to operate for a long period.

4279 2018-10-23 17:00:57 We can always eliminate that’s cost by capping off all pipe lines that run through Eastern Canada! But as for all the trains that transport oil and those spills that don’t get media attention, that will be purely the cost of your provincial government and Federal government!
4280 2018-10-23 17:00:48 Building the Energy East Pipeline was an expensive way to get oil to tidewater, and cutting off the Saudis can be done without doing that, because oil is a global market, and if Saudi oil comes somewhere else - China? - US oil displaced by tariffs comes to Eastern Canada.

4292 2018-10-23 16:59:50 It’s really a matter of scale sadly, if it takes 10x the fuel, you’re burning way more oil, making way more CO2. Plastic pollution sucks but it’s also sort of locking up CO2 that could be burned. Re-useability of glass is great though.

4297 2018-10-23 16:59:22 USD 3 Billion . finally a sigh of relief for Pakistan's  economy.  + $3 billion savings in deferred oil payment. Approx 2-3 months. But question remains the same. At what cost??

4318 2018-10-23 16:57:13 Is that the cannabis oil?

4321 2018-10-23 16:57:07 Last time I changed my own oil, I got some in my mouth.
4322 2018-10-23 16:57:07 Very good for consumers because these local companies were killing us. Increasing prices daily. Now they will offload all the hidden cooking oil from their warehouses
4323 2018-10-23 16:57:04 How wonderful! We hope you enjoy this fabulous oil!

4330 2018-10-23 16:56:44 Hello Peter.  I was using a tung oil there and it was freshly applied.  It glistens when wet.
4331 2018-10-23 16:56:43 Increase investment in renewable energy sources, restore the scrapped green rebates, increase funds for research and innovation into more renewable energy sources and further diversify our economy so we wouldn't need to rely on oil.

4347 2018-10-23 16:55:31 We need to stop buying their oil as by doing so we are helping fund these types of gov and their atrocities, what would hurt SA is for Canada to have the ability to compete with them globally by getting our product to tidewater.

4352 2018-10-23 16:55:11 they make products just for this. but you definitely should not do it with regular motor oil the additives aren't great.

4361 2018-10-23 16:53:53 I have been looking into CBD oil. Heard good things about it within the trade.
4362 2018-10-23 16:53:51 Crude oil shown good correction today and Dollar seen some downside from here so we can expect equity market become stable here, upmove for nifty  till 10700 CMP 10150 with stop loss 10000.

4364 2018-10-23 16:53:31 What an awful statistic  whilst you've been away, we've been using #rangtan to learn more about the retrieval of Palm Oil and deforestation.  We've written a story opener about it. Hope you are all having a great time- we've missed you in class and I won a bridge game! 
4365 2018-10-23 16:53:27 Not all crude oil is the same.  Venezuelan crude is much heavier than light-sweet crude...it is also cheaper...and it has it's uses.
4366 2018-10-23 16:53:26 Not abandon completely no. But it's a finite resource that currently makes a lot of our adversaries rich and influential. I'd think reducing our dependence on foreign oil would be a very Trump-ian thing. But for some reason it's not
4367 2018-10-23 16:53:24 @pepboysauto made an appt for 1 tire installed on my truck at Store 401 in Glassboro, NJ for today at 11am.

4370 2018-10-23 16:53:16 This oil thing is going to throw the world economy back in turmoil. All on account of one rogue producer. In any event, is OPEC still the lever it used to be on oil production and pricing? Russia is not an OPEC member but surely it too influences world prices!

4373 2018-10-23 16:53:08 Won't is such a negative word.  I'm trying to help people become healthier.  So, I'm going to keep sharing regardless of your negativity.  If peppermint oil helps you with a medical condition, why wouldn't you share it to help other people who might benefit from it?
4374 2018-10-23 16:53:08 As I said on @CNBCFuturesNow last week --The Saudi's have angered the world --I think they want to turn that around --that's why they won't use oil as a weapon --
4375 2018-10-23 16:53:04 Just remembered my car needs an oil change. Pretty sure it needed it a long time ago.
4376 2018-10-23 16:53:01 They got me confused
4377 2018-10-23 16:52:59 Hope so...  Trump is mad at Iran..  if Iran sanctions were not imposed,, oil would have been kess than 50 i think..  then comes additional sanctions on Russia, And venezuela both are giant oild producibg countries....I think,, by this way Usa wants to capture the oil market
4378 2018-10-23 16:52:44 Idk but that’s what being reported that 3 billion dollars ka oil on deferred payment per year which will be for 3 years and we’ll get 3 billion dollars ka oil each year for 3 years (extendable)
4379 2018-10-23 16:52:43 She’s got to go.  She would be instrumental in helping Muslims take over those oil fields.  Where’s there’s oil & drugs, there’s Muslims.

4384 2018-10-23 16:52:31 No question but the hope for him to take that next step was never realistic and his body hasn't done him any favours. Shapo & Felix will need to have great careers to reach where Milos has got to but it could happen. This truly is a golden era for men's tennis in Canada.
4385 2018-10-23 16:52:28 Nothing to do with petrodollar....there's no such thing anyway, the petrodollar is just the US dollar, it's referred to petrodollar because all oil sales were transacted in USD. It makes no sense that the UK harbours Jihadists or does so because of USD
4386 2018-10-23 16:52:26 I have to agree. It’s most likely fake. Russia is a know source for fake spirits. It’s probably cheaper spirits mixed with motor oil.

4403 2018-10-23 16:51:56 No not really I sold my transport $NSC and my oil $PSX kept my spec that’s only 5% of my portfolio and rounded off my positions in $JPM and $PFE then sold calls in the money calls against them and made cash. Plus I have dividends that are about to payout.
4404 2018-10-23 16:51:50 wats this confusion abt oil? Is it $3 Bn or 3+3+3=9 Bn?
4405 2018-10-23 16:51:42 The main focus should be on building Energy East and stop importing Saudi oil

But believe I addressed the local sourcing issue that has been missed.
  I analogize PRC's actions similar to Std Oil's back in the day..short term OK, then the locals are gone resulting in defacto monopolies.
4416 2018-10-23 16:50:35 I know what our govt did to the Native Americans over oil. Rubber bullets. Tear gas. I'm concerned for the migrants safety. I wish all of this was over already. Whatever the reason that these people are walking, they're coming here for safety. Asylum. WE GRANT ASYLUM.

4423 2018-10-23 16:49:33 The other piece of this discussion, imo, is it is easier to employ an undocumented immigrant doing agricultural work than working an oil rig.
Why? Employers & Gov't Control. Independent farms aren't subjected to the same employment fines as opposed to Corps that are fracking.
4424 2018-10-23 16:49:32 والنعم فيك،،،
4425 2018-10-23 16:49:26 It’s a non-starter to suggest people who oppose expanding the O&G infrastructure think we can stop using oil entirely. We don’t. We all have to use oil products. That’s fact. But we can STOP the expansion of those systems, and reprobate our economy. Also fact.
4426 2018-10-23 16:49:07 僕を酸化させたらダメだよ。オイルにとって酸化は命取り。…僕を見守っててね⁇
4427 2018-10-23 16:49:02 "It was also agreed that a one-year deferred payment facility for the import of oil, up to $3 billion, will be provided by Saudi Arabia,"
4428 2018-10-23 16:49:01 Isn't that 3 billion dollars in reserve and additional 3 billion dollars worth of oil in deferred payments?
4429 2018-10-23 16:48:56 If I had a newer home a full-size air to air heat pump (not a mini split)  would be my 100% choice.  But According to my average heating costs it’s approx $100 a month of oil to heat my home (upstairs apartment) . That’s a fraction of what electrical baseboard would cost
4430 2018-10-23 16:48:55 I like that angle too. Oil is still necessary for a ton of things outside of burning it. So I think (I hope) we can get the best of both world.
4431 2018-10-23 16:48:50 @iKamranShahid Its time all our political parties raised above petty politics on petrol/diesel & aggressively push for e-mobility. Trains running on electricity, E-buses, e-rickshaws can substantially cut demand for imported oil & also reduce air pollution to a large extent.
4432 2018-10-23 16:48:49 Was about to make something and then BOOM no olive oil.
4433 2018-10-23 16:48:46 What happend to oil going to $100 ?!

4436 2018-10-23 16:48:30 When I was in college, I read Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring, that opened my eyes & I use very little insecticides, only 4 houseplants & only if I actually c insects on my plants.

4438 2018-10-23 16:48:28 Saskatchewan’s plan is missing a solid workable solution. If they look to succeed the provincial government needs to stop throwing money at the messes left by the oil and gas sectors. So far I give them a solid D for lack of planning.

4516 2018-10-23 16:43:00 China now imports more oil than US. Unless China can substitute Iranian oil with some other oil, you cannot reasonably expect China to cut refinery run rate. Same goes for India,
4517 2018-10-23 16:42:55 I don't disagree with that. From the perspective of the stocks in the broad energy sector, lower price oil doesn't necessarily mean bad news.  Refiners for example tend to benefit from cheaper oil.

4544 2018-10-23 16:40:51 Blows my mind that we remain dependent on middle East and Venezuelan oil.  Oil isn't the future and the quicker we wean ourselves off it the sooner places like Iran, Venezuela, Russia and Saudi Arabia lose influence around the world. Seems like a no brainier.

4549 2018-10-23 16:40:20 Yes there is advantage. Absolutely. Balance of payments pressure is reduced. CAD deficit due to oil imports will be under control for at least 4 to 6 months.

4555 2018-10-23 16:40:01 Oil facility is a loan. It should have the same impact on BOP as the other loan. If you take official estimates on funding need ($10 to $12bn) seems to me they might be in spitting distance of avoiding IMF if they get China on the hook for $5bn-ish.
4556 2018-10-23 16:40:00 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 Billion for next 3 years in form of deferred oil payments. 
                          +
3 billion will deposit in Pak account.

Total = 12 Billion

4574 2018-10-23 16:38:30 $ 3 billion (deposit) + $ 3 billion (deferred oil payments) by Saudi Arabia
4575 2018-10-23 16:38:30 Um, just so we keep the math straight, 86,000 barrels a year is roughly 3.6 million gallons a year, after year after year.  Still too much oil in the water, but again, production puts only a fraction of the oil in the water compared to transportation (Saudi) or natural seeps.

4582 2018-10-23 16:38:10 Saudi Arabia agrees to place a deposit of USD 3 Billion for a period of one year as balance of payment support to Pakistan, and to allow oil import on  1-year deferred payment, up to USD 3 Billion.

4588 2018-10-23 16:37:50 Canadians  buy oil, buy products made from oil. Canadians get these products from companies buying thru foreign companies because our federal gov wont push pipelines thru, but instead made regulatory changes making it harder for needed pipelines. So I'll bug Trudeau thanks.

4590 2018-10-23 16:37:46 Since nobody in BC (or Europe) is starving or freezing because of carbon taxes, I would say that your statement is childish hyperbole. Reduction of oil usage will reduce the amount of foreign oil imported, so your word salad makes no sense.

4617 2018-10-23 16:36:26 Saudi oil is exempt from Trudeau's #CarbonTax. Because only Canadian oil harms the environment. Just like the Greens are not protesting US pipelines, or Saudi oil imports into the St Lawrence, only Canadian pipelines exporting Canadian oil.
Isn't "evidence based" policy great?

4619 2018-10-23 16:36:12 This is true, but out of our control. Oil is being propped up through subsidies world wide and is getting harder to get. Us going carbon free would mean an economic head start once oil is no longer sustainable as a sector. And that day seems to be getting closer.
4620 2018-10-23 16:36:11 Stop funding them, take their oil as our own and watch the place turn back into a desert.
4621 2018-10-23 16:36:08 #SaudiArabia — a friend indeed — to place $3 bn for one year to bolster  #Pakistan’s reserves & give oil on deferred payment...this cash & oil facility is larger than expectations. Now Pakistan is likely to go for a smaller loan package from the #IMF.

4632 2018-10-23 16:35:31 Correction, @AndrewScheer won't specifically rule out cancelling the LAV contract (and it's billion-dollar penalty), but vows to cut off Saudi Arabia oil imports to protest Khashoggi murder and replace with domestic oil. If only there was a pipeline to get it to NB refineries.
4633 2018-10-23 16:35:30 Put a sanction on importing Saudi oil? Corporations buy oil not Canada.

4642 2018-10-23 16:34:35 I have pampered myself these past couple of days. Nose strip, moisturiser, coconut oil and drinking plenty of water. It feels nice to look after yourself inside and out 
4643 2018-10-23 16:34:34 budgets balance themselves, deficits will top out at $10 billion, small business owners are tax cheats, oil sands must be phased out..  brought to you by the same people who are today telling you their carbon, woops-pollution tax will put money back into your pocket.
4644 2018-10-23 16:34:31 Be careful about poo pooing socialistic values, most Canadians embrace allot of them. You can’t just sing the praises of more Canadian oil for all and more American style capitalism, that gets you nowhere. You need a better plan, holding Alberta doesn’t make you Prime Minister

4656 2018-10-23 16:33:49 1 liter of oil contains 3 weeks of hard physical labour,159 litres to a  barrel, the average Canadian uses 26 barrels per year, the equivalent of 300 energy slaves 26 barrels at let's say $70 USD or 91.67 CAD for $2383.42 CAD, you get 300 slaves to transport you, feed you, etc
4657 2018-10-23 16:33:46 It is being rammed down our throats, ask the many industry experts and job creators that are warning the carbon tax will hurt our economy. The Saskatchewan model for example would rather invest in technology to lower emissions in the oil sands, not everything is solved by a tax.
4658 2018-10-23 16:33:34 Canceling this contract will have no effect whatsoever, they can buy similar vehicles anywhere. Saudi power is derived from oil revenue, if we want to hurt them let’s become energy independent and provide them some competition by getting our oil to the global market.

4665 2018-10-23 16:32:39 Saudi Arabia comes to Pakistan’s rescue (financially) by offering $3 billion for balance of payment support and a similar amount per annum re deferred oil payments. 

A strong and stable Pakistan is in Saudi’s interest and hence this is a mutually beneficial arrangement.
4666 2018-10-23 16:32:21 That and the Lucas speed wax are great products. Tire shine is easy to apply and lasts a long time.
4667 2018-10-23 16:32:20 That was fun - watching @AndrewScheer talk nonsense on @CBCNews 
Stop buying Saudi Oil - then what ??? We can't refine bitumen . Idiot !
4668 2018-10-23 16:32:15 Well Done PM Imran Khan! Oil import of $3 billion worth on deferred payment for three years from Saudi Arabia and additional USD 3 billion to be parked in the Pakistan's National Treasury for 1 year by KSA. This will provide breathing space for sure
4669 2018-10-23 16:32:14 KSA agrees to place $3 Billion in State Bank of Pakistan to help out with balance of payment issue. Also, agrees to supply oil worth 3 Billion and to ease foreign exchange pressure. This is how foreign visit succeeds .Well done.
4670 2018-10-23 16:32:13 First off he did not vote for an oil tax. He voted against a non binding resolution regarding an oil tax. So that is not quite pants in fire but not exactly honest either and the other is also only half true. He did vote for direct relief.

4672 2018-10-23 16:32:01 So what is the benefit for Pakistan having an oil refinery?
4673 2018-10-23 16:31:54 Can I ask why wind, solar, and water energy is so bad compared to oil and gas?

4675 2018-10-23 16:31:46 Conservative leader Andrew Scheer is being pressed by reporters whether he thinks Canada should cancel the Saudi Lav contract. Doesn't answer directly with a yes or a no, only that this is the time to analyze the situation and that Canada should stop buying Saudi oil.
4676 2018-10-23 16:31:43 Obanikoro, BabaChair, Omi, Rotimi, Kalu and the likes that jump the fence weren't they part of the ship that sunk our oil revenue dry? What is happening with them? Insurance cover them I guess
4677 2018-10-23 16:31:36 Sir the prices should continue to be in line with global oil prices we cannot afford another hidden subsidy which just hits the balance of payment 3 years down the line. Let’s plan for a better future by using the space

4682 2018-10-23 16:31:14 Saudi oil makes up about 1/3 of what we import, but less than 10% of what we use. A prudent plan to manage a short-term pinch, combined with controls on trading and aggressive efficiency & renewable development could get us complete energy independence within a few years.

4696 2018-10-23 16:30:14 Iran has no need to hide anything other than for the purpose of boosting the price of oil by misleading the world that its exports are down. They can sell to anyone that’s defying US pressure. China’s import appetite is a lot higher than during previous round of sanctions.

4702 2018-10-23 16:29:59 When asked if @AndrewScheer would cancel Saudi arms deal, he said he'd sell more Canadian oil (government doesn't buy/sell oil).
Asked again & he repeated in french.
Then says it's something to explore, claims his party demanded sanctions (wrong).
His party sold arms to Saudi
4703 2018-10-23 16:29:52 Comm’on sir, we still have to pay after 3 years and also all oil implrt above 3b usd every year. Our crude oil imports are more than 10b Usd per year. All other oil based products come in addition. Its a releif and buys us some time to decrease our current account deficit.
4704 2018-10-23 16:29:49 I agree. I will sign - like I’ve signed many. Beware- many Vegan goods have Palm Oil in them. @Nestle are  HUGE buyers of Palm oil too. I’ve gone back to non-branded organic oats and back to basics on lots of foods. I avoid brands where poss.

4766 2018-10-23 16:26:08 Indeed it’s quite a slippery slope between the two. We have no business trying to coddle Iran. Further, we need to withdraw from our dependence on Saudi Arabia. Confused why we have to import oil.  Save land or lives. Democracy or Totalitarian Terrorist Abiding.
4767 2018-10-23 16:26:06 Not much chance of surviving if they can't heat their homes, pay for food or get to work. Let's keep shipping oil by rail & importing foreign oil which comes by the shipload risking our oceans. He talks outta his sewage ass.
4768 2018-10-23 16:26:06 um, you're linking to Fox? That's like me linking to a nine year-old boy who's just been grounded for pulling pigtails. I won't watch because it hurts but, hopefully whoever it is is saying 'yay! Big oil is reinvesting in renewables & let's stop selling bombs to dictators'
4769 2018-10-23 16:26:05 Lp and dispensaries prices are way out to lunch ordered from my lp paid 160$ for 10 grams of flower and 30 ml of oil.
4770 2018-10-23 16:26:01 Oil prices does not depend whether we receive this loan or not. Hope that Oil should not break $90 ceiling. Currently hovering around $80.
4771 2018-10-23 16:25:58 No. Slightly smoky, but far better combustion and less oil scavenge to jet flow.
4772 2018-10-23 16:25:58 Its 3 Billion per year for oil so total of 9 Billions in 3 years plus 3 billion for balance payement .so total of 12 Billions .
4773 2018-10-23 16:25:52 Greece is by no means a country I'd call socialist, as their problems date back to the Cold War ( where they received an incredible amount of American funding)

Venezuela didn't fail because of socialism,Oil prices ( it'S main export) dropping and overt corruption did it in.

4790 2018-10-23 16:24:47 Saudi Arabia is shipping free oil to friends like Jordan and Pakistan. Iran ships to Syria. Those are still exports. We count exports, not business transactions or donations. The oil is eventually consumed. China’s storing everyone’s oil, so no difference if it’s from Iran.
4791 2018-10-23 16:24:46 Means 3 billion per year on oil so total of 9 Billions Dollar plus 3 Billion dollar for balance of Payment
4792 2018-10-23 16:24:45 Here in the U.S.  we have a massive surplus of soybeans.  If China is not going buy our beans because of the #tradewar  we might as well use some of that soy oil for a 7% blend with diesel to meet the IMO sulfur emissions cap.

4811 2018-10-23 16:23:35 No, it is not. Saudi is not under sanctions.The effect on the market at the moment is how much exports have been curtailed from Iran. Sales are the number that is important not exports because that is indicating who is actually processing Iranian oil.

4824 2018-10-23 16:22:57 Saudi Arabia pledges funds to Pakistan. 3bn in temporary funds for foreign reserves, 3bn worth of oil on deferred payments. Sounds like PM Imran's decision to go despite a complicated political situation paid dividends!

4872 2018-10-23 16:20:07 This has nothing to do with increase in oil prices brother. We are not getting the oil for free. We are getting it on deferred payment. And the price is not FIXED. It can never be fixed because it’s pegged to the international prices. 

The two things have no correlation

4916 2018-10-23 16:17:39 History shows me that Barack Obama (who i voted for) and a full democrat Senate & House couldn't make a dent in the oil and war industry.

4919 2018-10-23 16:17:36 But wasn’t the low price of oil a major factor in energy east being abandoned?
4920 2018-10-23 16:17:33 The multiverse brain take is that profitable, capital-intensive oil drilling is exactly the same as breaking even, labor-intensive farming.
4921 2018-10-23 16:17:32 They have oil?

4924 2018-10-23 16:17:18 No you would have to pay for previous years oil to get oil for next yr so you cannot add them al together but it helps in each successive budget.
4925 2018-10-23 16:17:17 .@TeamCavuto hilarious that Merkel doesn't trust the Saudi's but she bets the entire gas and oil future of her country on the Russians.

4928 2018-10-23 16:16:51 a días de entrada en vigor de las sanciones a Irán, y en medio de un feroz conflicto diplomático con Arabia Saudita, el $OIL se manda una fuerte baja.
Para cerrar posiciones, estimo.
4929 2018-10-23 16:16:46 Iraq doesn't export as much oil compared to how much Saudi Arabia exports, and any oil must be sold to the world market. So again, we ALL benefit from cheap oil. You can't "steal" oil because there's no point. When you sell it you have to sell it into the global market.
4930 2018-10-23 16:16:46 Starting with small %, 5 maybe which would be negligible on most bookings this alone equates to a large sum generated. Il stick with BA for example. 45.2m pax in ‘17 on flights averaging £350 would be £800m in revenue. And with fuel/oil/emission costs at £2.9b it cuts it by 27%
4931 2018-10-23 16:16:39 Investment in oil by saudi arabia means Pakistan's economy gonna strong, and there will be no price rise from now.
4932 2018-10-23 16:16:30 At least coal is useful.
4933 2018-10-23 16:16:29 Arabiya said Saudis agrees to postpone Pakistan's oil payment.

You skin will thank you.
4935 2018-10-23 16:16:26 Look, the Saudis hacked Khashoggi up, can we all stop arguing about how or why? I just need someone to get pissed off, my calls on crude oil need to pulled back up in value.
4936 2018-10-23 16:16:24 Check your Engine oil this Sunday.
4937 2018-10-23 16:16:22 DID YOU KNOW? The most influential national (state-owned) oil and gas companies according to the Financial Times are CNPC (China), Saudi Aramco (Saudi Arabia), Petrobras (Brazil), Petronas (Malaysia), PDVSA (Venezuela), Gazprom (Russia), and National Iranian Oil Company (Iran).
4938 2018-10-23 16:16:19 Sir if internationally oil prices increase how it will not cost pak?
4939 2018-10-23 16:16:19 explain to me how Barack Obama & a Democrat congress took on Big Oil and won.
4940 2018-10-23 16:16:07 hope you will do one of your podcasts to calm Heid's nerves.
4941 2018-10-23 16:16:06 Maybe we should subtract S.A. from our oil sources?  
4942 2018-10-23 16:16:05 今の金融機関の人間は金銭関係のことでオールラウンダーになっていってるのは本当ですけどね
4943 2018-10-23 16:16:04 in my little understanding it will ease the pressure on a balance sheet and act like a bank guarantee for 1 year, oil payment deferred means they can allow to collect USD for one year without any outgoing, so year-end cash in hand
4944 2018-10-23 16:16:01 @JosefSchachter BTE is taking it on the chin. BTE has already been sold off beyond belief. What does the mkt think a ~100000 bbl/day mostly light oil, reserve rich company is worth? What doea the mkt want - a cheap take-over offer to the detriment to all.

Fundamentals are stronger than they’ve ever been in the last 10 years. And now everything is beyond cheap. We have very limited inflation that’s good. Oil is down
4950 2018-10-23 16:15:31 Now it is clear Saudi Arabia is wedding the power of OPEC against the EU they can't afford to have crude oil at $200

5045 2018-10-23 16:09:03 Actually it's just a short term effect, It may slip another $2 or $3/Barrel but will bounce back from there. Trump want's oil at lower price, but in the mean time he is confused on how to handle current Saudi situation.
5046 2018-10-23 16:08:57 That’s ridiculous! And it’s going to probably cost an arm, a leg, and your kidneys. I literally got an oil change, new wiper blades, and a few little odds and ends checked and it was $150. I’m ready to figure out how to change oil myself haha.

5050 2018-10-23 16:08:39 stocks down, yields down, oil down, dollar down... no one's allowed to make money today lol
5051 2018-10-23 16:08:34 Thank You Saudi Arabia 
Saudi Govt will deposit of USD 3 Billion for a period of one year as balance of payment support & also agreed one year deferred payment facility for import of oil up to USD 3 Billion...
5052 2018-10-23 16:08:25 @Jaguar please can you explain why Marshalls want to charge £570 to change the transmission oil in a 2007 x-type 2.0d manual ? That 0.7 litres of oil and at most 30 minutes work.
5053 2018-10-23 16:08:22 I left my lip oil therapy at home  so yeah... that’s how my day is going
5054 2018-10-23 16:08:21 Have tried to get an oil change twice today. Neither location had the right oil for my Fiat, Frank, but the good news is I got two bottles of free water.
5055 2018-10-23 16:08:17 Squeeze lubricating pipes with pincers or dent them with hammers, so that the flow of oil is obstructed.

5057 2018-10-23 16:08:12 @BrendanSchaub your child should be put on cbd feco (fully extracted cannabis oil). not cbd hemp oil.  no high and it will pass the blood brain barrier to alleviate the issue, whatever it is.  good luck.
5058 2018-10-23 16:08:10 A group called “Save Native American Families” is opposing Prop 127.  It's a utility company shell front exploiting Native Americans. Their treasurer is an oil industry lobbyist - they have no problem with scaring old people & co-opting Native culture with misleading ads
5059 2018-10-23 16:08:09 So deferred Oil payments will be $3 billion per Year for 3 years.
5060 2018-10-23 16:08:08 Whip cleaned, washed, and oil changed 
5061 2018-10-23 16:08:05 Very nice reset/liquidation of oil. Need it to go higher!
5062 2018-10-23 16:07:52 @Jeremy_Hunt When will you as Foreign Minister lead the way and make plans to reduce arms sales and the purchase of oil from Saudi Arabia.  Over time this would influences their behaviour without hurting our economy.

5067 2018-10-23 16:07:32 I really don’t wanna go get this oil changed 
5068 2018-10-23 16:07:29 It was also agreed that a one year deferred payment facility for import of oil, up to USD 3 Billion, will be provided by Saudi Arabia. This arrangement will be in place for three years, which will be reviewed thereafter.
5069 2018-10-23 16:07:21 We used to need their oil, less so now. But through tight alliance we want to influence who else gets/doesn’t get (China) Saudi oil. We also see them as an ally against Iran. But the Iranians are probably more trustworthy than the Saudis in some respects. Not smart to take sides.

5072 2018-10-23 16:07:02 Will be playing oil via mrf. Bought full lot ...Let's see
5073 2018-10-23 16:07:01 Saudi Arabia giving to Pakistan 3 billion dollars for one year plus 3 billion dollar oil on deferred payments yearly for 3 years. Big breakthrough.
5074 2018-10-23 16:06:53 I mean, yes. That's almost certainly what we will do. Doesn't make it right, moral, or good though. 

Maybe our bigger concern should be updating infrastructure and cutting our oil and coal addictions as they hinder our ability to advance technologically. Not walls
5075 2018-10-23 16:06:50 USD 3 Billion . finally a sigh of relief for Pakistan's  economy.  + $3 billion savings in deferred oil payment. Approx 2-3 months. But question remains the same. At what cost?? 

5076 2018-10-23 16:06:50 One refinery in Canada uses Saudi oil.    Only one.   Irving in New Brunswick.    Around 80 000 barrels a day.

Canada gulps around 2 million barrels a day for domestic consumption, meaning we get 4% of our oil from Saudi Arabia.    #cdnpoli
5077 2018-10-23 16:06:40 Yup. Got what he went for. $3bn loan and $3bn oil facility.
5078 2018-10-23 16:06:39 Energy market taking it on the chin. Figures Heating Oil would puke after some of the best harvest days and diesel demand. Might have to top tanks off again tomorrow.
5079 2018-10-23 16:06:35 The clearest answer to why is oil.  The world runs on it.  Not saying that's good, just how it is.

5082 2018-10-23 16:06:10 The Saudis will simply go to Russia and China and raise oil prices to what suits their economy after sanctions. But the question for you and the American people could you handle the bill of rising energy prices for a new democratic president?

5088 2018-10-23 16:06:00 Yet many nation states, most recently Germany, manage to cope fine? IMO the price you want to pay for that oil is soul-destroyingly high, what else would you be willing to sell? It is absolutely the dictionary definition of corrupt, and you sound a bit scared of waking up to it.

5183 2018-10-23 15:59:33 I was waiting for an oil change 
5184 2018-10-23 15:59:14 #Oil down 4% #Gold up 1%, #Stock Markets in red around the world
5185 2018-10-23 15:59:09 Yes #Nymex & #Brent Oil both down 4.25% 

Good for #India
5186 2018-10-23 15:59:06 とりあえず楽さんいらっしゃい、初SDだね
5187 2018-10-23 15:59:03 I’m discovering the benefits of full fat items like butter, avocados, walnuts and coconut oil. No more margarine for us!
5188 2018-10-23 15:58:54 zadać sobie troszkę trudu i zerknąć na np; Saudi Arabian Oil Company na zarząd - przeliczyć ilu tam jest obywateli USA i od kiedy-to ropa-Saudowie oraz Trump nic zasadniczo nie zrobią- hamulcowi będą w Waszyngtonie -aby tylko ropa do np; 120-150$/baryłka nie podskoczyła
5189 2018-10-23 15:58:52 Right, because our eastern provinces don't need oil anyway.
5190 2018-10-23 15:58:48 What if coconut oil makes you queasy..?
5191 2018-10-23 15:58:47 Sounds good, also diluted tee tree oil helped me when I had an infection in my nose ring and also using philosophy purity cleanser helps me to keep it clean.
5192 2018-10-23 15:58:45 Kingdom of #SaudiArabia (#KSA) promised 3 billion dollars oil per year for 3 years on loan (as free)

PM House (#Islamabad) presser says “3 billion dollars will be put in #Pakistan account to ease pressure on #PKR.”

#PTI got surety, a real bailout. 
PM visit termed “SUCCESSFUL.”
5193 2018-10-23 15:58:45 Time to move on from oil Now!
5194 2018-10-23 15:58:39 oil prices will be lowest now
5195 2018-10-23 15:58:37 It’s about that time to switch from your coconut oil to another
5196 2018-10-23 15:58:36 Any updates on that oil refinery thing?
5197 2018-10-23 15:58:35 getting my baby oil changed and allat.. struts, detailed, etc all coming this week cause nahhhhhh
5198 2018-10-23 15:58:29 12b needed according to AU. But i think its a good start because oil is an import which we cant avoid.
5199 2018-10-23 15:58:28 Moreover the highest Gej sold oil was 115 x 190 naira (dollar rate then). Buhari is selling for 90 dollar x 362 dollar rate now multiply let see who made more money. And we are still buying fuel 145 naira at low oil price u see why buhari is a fraud?
5200 2018-10-23 15:58:28 @ImranKhanPTI had to bend his morals for the nation, another example of his commitment to Pakistan. By ignoring #JamalKhashoggi 's murder he has successfully secured $3bn debt on Oil and & 3bn for balance of payment crisis from #KSA excluding investment from #InvesmentConference
5201 2018-10-23 15:58:28 Can we increase the amount of oil we buy from Venezuela and ultimately severe ties with these Saudi sponsors of terror? (Think Osama bin Laden and the 9/11 hijackers)

Just sayin'
5202 2018-10-23 15:58:26 The oil and gas industry must be regulated so they don't destroy the environment. Taking away regulations doesn't kill jobs, it just makes the companies and CEOs richer, not the people. Wake up, Texas.
5203 2018-10-23 15:58:24 Manipulated to be that way by the original Robber Barrons. 
Edison was working on electric cars at the beginning of LAST century (they killed it).

5205 2018-10-23 15:58:19 I got a '99 Cadillac Eldorado. Haven't ran in at least 5 years. (it ran but I didn't bother starting it during the winter) Full tank of gas that's probably filled with water. Oil probably sludge. Should I fix it up or ditch it and get another car. I dropped $9K in 2008
5206 2018-10-23 15:58:17 I scheduled an oil change on my designated nap day. #adultinggonewrong

5213 2018-10-23 15:57:55 That may be as far as the arms deal is concerned. What about the billions of dollars in oil we are buying from them? Energy East would have made it possible for Canada to tell the Saudi's to stuff it, but this government decided it would rather buy Saudi oil than Alberta's.

5225 2018-10-23 15:57:15 Yeah good luck with that. Took the oil 10 years to draft an elite right shot puck moving defenseman. Now they are going to trade him for a poor version of hall that wants $8/year?  I know it’s Chiarelli but still.

5236 2018-10-23 15:56:34 Oil prices should recede 1 St week of December.
5237 2018-10-23 15:56:32 Inspite of my criticism over PTI policies,this was one of brilliant speeches ever he has made in front of international community. It was his successful effort, bringing in $3 bln balance of payment package & $3 bln oil deferred facility ---tussle useless.
5238 2018-10-23 15:56:31 Always been a question that the extreme wahabist element in the Saudi hierarchy played some part in 911. If so, the US ignored it because of oil control.  Now oil independent, the US still wants to control Saudi oil through close alliance. Kashoggi’s murder is thus down-played.
5239 2018-10-23 15:56:27 At what point did I say that "I speak for all disabled people"?  Everyone is different. I can't have peppermint oil, but it works for others. Doesn't mean I'm suggesting it to anyone. It's kinda like being recommended yoga all the time. Ooh, that CAPS have come out 
5240 2018-10-23 15:56:26 Uh....when therapy works, it's an amazement. And when it works in such little time, it's almost like wondering if it's really snake oil and you're just waiting for the other shoe to drop.
5241 2018-10-23 15:56:26 Yes I need oil
5242 2018-10-23 15:56:25 My grandmother came charging into my room to pray and get olive oil over all my shit
5243 2018-10-23 15:56:25 Crude oil loosing it (-4%), but #USDCAD not benefiting.  $CAD
5244 2018-10-23 15:56:22 And prices will drop. Good for Zimbos earning peanuts. Seriously we can't be buying $10 cooking oil No
5245 2018-10-23 15:56:19 shouldn’t be more than $45 before tax. They all using the same oil pretty much, it’s the labor charges that change

5248 2018-10-23 15:56:13 So $3bln debt and $3bln deferred oil payments. Mission accomplished 
5249 2018-10-23 15:56:11 Most countries are like “yeaaaa, the planet is dying. That sucks. But like look at all the OIL” 
5250 2018-10-23 15:56:11 To be  honest I rather not look at them right now...I was doing so well lately and today got caught in this oil selloff. Not too happy.
5251 2018-10-23 15:56:06 Black castor oil & Wild growth oil  get on
5252 2018-10-23 15:56:06 Oil power is too big to be ignored by anyone...
5253 2018-10-23 15:56:06 which Iraqi government ? The puppets installed by the US ? You must be joking. I agree with you, the US is the oil whore who never feels saturated. Did the price of oil dropped after the Iraqi war ? Really ? During the 8 years oil prices kept going up
5254 2018-10-23 15:56:04 For me there is no joy in 3 billions aid and 3 billions oil facility. ..real achievement is KSA agreeing to invest in Oil refinery and minerals exploration. ..minimum investment could be 20 plus billions  $ with massive kick start in PK overall economy  ..but no one discussing
5255 2018-10-23 15:56:01 Now if we really want to see some impact why don’t we nationalize our oil and energy from the refinery stage, and buy oil from private CANADIAN owned companies at $75/barrel and a $50 tax used for green energy investment. Charge that same $50 to imported oil.
5256 2018-10-23 15:55:59 Like "normal" is now a feasible destination either way. What does he mean by normal anyway?

Iraq, 9/11, the poll tax, sleaze scandals (90's), crushing the unions (Thatcher),70's oil shock, suez, Korea, Vietnam, Palestine, WWII,  financial crash?
5257 2018-10-23 15:55:57 Smarmy disliked lying TED. Don’t worry, if you lose your job you can always go back to lobbying for big pharma and big oil, continuing to screw your state and it’s population. At least #Beto is a unifier and not a wimp that looks only after himself. #independent #deletecruz

5260 2018-10-23 15:55:44 Oil revenue was high in what year and what year.the period it was high we bought fuel 87 naira I don’t expect u to know the higher the price of oil the more subsidy we pay.
5261 2018-10-23 15:55:43 Didnt seem to bother Trump to impose tariffs on everyone else. Tariff their oil.
5262 2018-10-23 15:55:40 Just b/c the US is dumb enough to spend Billions to protect them is no reason for the german people to not make the best deal they can for oil & gas Bring all troops in Germany home & let them protect their own land while we protect ours
5263 2018-10-23 15:55:32 In the United States you can start with nothing and make something of yourself. John D Rockefeller was born in to poverty worked hard invested in oil refining and became the richest individual in history that is something that is unique to America
5264 2018-10-23 15:55:29 humans can have "aha" moments, but corporations cannot. for me, climate change and what to do about it were epiphanies. there is no time for incremental solutions; we have to put the first oil company out of business, now. fixing media will be easier with fewer oil companies.
5265 2018-10-23 15:55:27 KSA is giving oil for $9b defer payments for the span of three years. And will keep $3b in Pakistani banks. So why are you saying this investment a LOAN.
5266 2018-10-23 15:55:19 Means they don’t have oil, that’s the same thing they say about Kenya

5279 2018-10-23 15:54:33 When I did the math, Bank of Kunlun is paying for all of the oil that China is buying (600-700K/day). I do not believe this will go to zero come November.

3. Year 2- Oil import worth $3B with deffered payment of 1 Year
4. Year 3- Oil import worth $3B with deffered payment of 1 Year

So I will take it as support worth 3 + 3×3=12B
5294 2018-10-23 15:53:05 ..and where are the paychecks shipped?  Perfect spot for bitcoin.

5297 2018-10-23 15:52:55 budgets balance themselves, deficits will top out at $10 billion, small business owners are tax cheats, oil sands must be phased out..  brought to you by the same people who are today telling you their carbon, woops-pollution tax will put money back into your pocket.

5303 2018-10-23 15:52:30 do i really want to get my oil changed today? no, not at all. will i? yeah totes
5304 2018-10-23 15:52:30 I think they also realise they have a limited amount of time to sell their oil before it becomes worthless.  They don't want anyone outside of the club taking up market share #keepitintheground will eventually succeed. Diminishing asset.
5305 2018-10-23 15:52:27 Selloffs in the market today unusual. Mostly oil. The oligarchs trying to buy an election with expensive ads with those profits?
5306 2018-10-23 15:52:27 @ImranGhazaliPK  What a fantastic useful visit of PM to Saudi Arabia.

1. Deposit of 3 billion dollars in Pakistan Bank 

2. Saudis will provide petroleum on deffered payment worth dollar 3 billion and repayed after 3 years. 

4. Saudis agreed to establish oil refinery in Pakista
5307 2018-10-23 15:52:26 1. 3 billion in deposite for 1 Year
2. Year 1- Oil import worth $3B with deffered payment of 1 Year
3. Year 2- Oil import worth $3B with deffered payment of 1 Year
4. Year 3- Oil import worth $3B with deffered payment of 1 Year

So I will take it as support worth 3 + 3×3=12B

5310 2018-10-23 15:52:16 Its so mediocre all the time it starts with this cursed cooking oil. I m so embarrassed.
5311 2018-10-23 15:52:06 "Saudia has agreed to provide Pak $3 billion dollars for a year to for balance-of-payments crisis. Kingdom has also agreed to provide Islamabad a one-year deferred payment facility for import of oil, worth up to $3 billion."

Less borrowing from IMF.

5447 2018-10-23 15:43:13 Hopefully there are no secret conditions, finally great  financial support by #SaudiArabia to #Pakistan to overcome financial crisis, 3 billion USD in shape of deferred oil payment, and three billion USD  for one year for balance of payment support: #NotoIMF

5450 2018-10-23 15:42:58 butuh. karena even tho your skin is oily, they still need moisture, lebih saranin yg hydrating jd menambah pasukan air instead of oil yg dimana kulit km udh oily. but it depends on your taste sih. aku personally use sephora coconut/green tea moisturizer
5451 2018-10-23 15:42:53 According to IITA, Nigeria has some of the most fertile soils on earth and so why can't most of the $35.4billion, which is bigger than our $30billion annual revenues from oil, come to Nigeria instead? It is not coming because our focus is on $30billion we get from oil.

5484 2018-10-23 15:41:20 Right, so the government of Iraq signing an oil contract with a western company is not, in fact, "stealing oil". It's selling oil. Any oil that is sold has to be sold to the world market, so there is actually no benefit in "stealing" oil. We all benefit from cheap oil.
5485 2018-10-23 15:41:20 $60 here gets you 31% plus. I buy the $30 1/8ths of shake which is just popcorn- perfect for making oil and on Sunday’s it’s actually $175 a zip

5497 2018-10-23 15:40:37 Trudeau didn’t block the Energy East pipeline, Skippy. But you already know that, don’t you? The govt of Canada doesn’t buy oil, but private industry, in this case Irving Refineries, do. But God forbid you put blame where it belongs

5597 2018-10-23 15:34:27 It has been agreed Saudi Arabia will place a deposit of USD 3 Billion for a period of one year as balance of payment support. It has also been agreed that a one year deferred payment facility for import of oil, up to USD 3 Billion, will be provided by Saudi Arabia to Pakistan.
5598 2018-10-23 15:34:27 It hasn't even been 15 years. Wait for that oil money to dry up and see what happens.

If the US cut all ties with Saudi Arabia the price of gas and oil would skyrocket so high nobody would be able to afford to drive a car.

5696 2018-10-23 15:27:57 these ppl from an oil company came to my house, banging on my door. i go downstairs and hear one of em try to open my door. what kind of shit is that
5697 2018-10-23 15:27:57 For how long will you have the moral upper hand only because you have the oil resources? Ultimately your ghastly deeds will catch up & you will rot like feaces.

5699 2018-10-23 15:27:51 So way back when the Romans would take on war elephants, they would cover pigs in oil and set them on fire. The squealing of burning pigs would freak the elephants out.

... Yeah. So I'm just going to leave that there.

b. It was also agreed that a one year deferred payment facility for import of oil, up to USD 3 Billion, will be provided by Saudi Arabia. This arrangement will be in place for three years, which will be reviewed thereafter.

5720 2018-10-23 15:26:35 Then why they want us to stop buying oil from Iran.
5721 2018-10-23 15:26:34 He would put a 8 or 10% tax on oil. Which means the oil companies will suffer resulting in mass layoffs
5722 2018-10-23 15:26:31 Funny the GOP never seems to run out of giving our tax money away, to their owners/donors, big oil and other corporations that don't need it , and  the wealthy.

5730 2018-10-23 15:26:00 Saudi energy minister comments today clearly not on same page as climate, global warming, and Paris accord advocates.  They more than prepared to pump more oil according to demand earer term-evidently 'hang the planet'.

5814 2018-10-23 15:20:02 I think a call for sanctions are in order. No more saudi oil. For anyone. We could easily blockade their ports and prevent any oil from getting in and out.
5815 2018-10-23 15:19:59 so lets build a larger pipeline - sell more oil faster - and save the planet
5816 2018-10-23 15:19:58 Saudi Arabia to provide US 3 Billion dollars deposit as balance of payment, one year deferred payment for oil facility, upto US 3 bln and confirms construction of oil refinery.  Good job @ImranKhanPTI 
5817 2018-10-23 15:19:57 I've found that using coconut oil does wonders for icing.  Don't need much, and it stiffens up nicely with cooling.
5818 2018-10-23 15:19:57 Just in: KSA has agreed to deposit $3 bill for 1 year period with the State Bank of Pakistan to help address its detoxifying BOP position. Riyadh will also provide a $3 bill deferred payment facility for oil which will also ease BOP stress.
5819 2018-10-23 15:19:57 Right. If climate change was so important to this government you’d think they’d want to get our own oil instead of buying and shipping from across the world
5820 2018-10-23 15:19:54 I'm sure the US will remain blind on their Saudi-eye. That's about what was agreed for ending the oil crisis in the 70s. Just keep in mind what they did in the Iraq/Iran war-supplying both. It's about the same now. Ok,they let China + Russia support Iran but it's close to that
5821 2018-10-23 15:19:50 From experience, it'll take like, at LEAST a week of using an oil cleanser before they really start to budge (I was surprised how long it took when I decided, "Eh, I'm done with these" - they're actually a lot more resilient than your tech makes them out to be!)
5822 2018-10-23 15:19:47 Yay! We hope you love this incredible oil and its wonderful therapeutic properties!
5823 2018-10-23 15:19:45 Jones is a horrible GM. This aint the trading floor where he made his money trading oil futures. If it wasnt for Jimmy Johnson, we'd still have only 2 SB rings. Jerry is too much of a megalomaniac to share the glory. We need a dedicated GM or a HeadCoach that can do both. ie;JJ
5824 2018-10-23 15:19:39 We hope you love this wonderful oil!
5825 2018-10-23 15:19:33 I must admit I love watching the LA Lakers now that MOAT LeBron James has joined Lorenzo Ball. The comedy is priceless !!  Lakers destined for a 20 win season. Same as watching a slow motion train wreck. So enjoyable. Worst team in West. LeBum is done. Should have stayed in Cleve

2. Called “collateral damage”, in their minds.
3. Remember “Blood for Oil”? Same people. 
4. “Oil is thicker than water and blood.” Quote today.
5. Money talks. Especially in politics.
5830 2018-10-23 15:19:22 Gee, I wonder where Canadians could get oil if they did not have Saudi Arabia....

5835 2018-10-23 15:19:05 RIP..Saudi Arabia with its mad crown prince and despotic salafist Islam is threat to world. I dont understand why west supports terrorist producing country like Saudi and ignore more liberal Islamic democracy Iran. Is it only for oil and Israel???
5836 2018-10-23 15:19:04 Most people agree something should be done, I say quit buying oil from the Middle East.

5842 2018-10-23 15:18:29 If you have enough oil you can fuck the world in its ass and no one will say shit. Welcome to our deservedly doomed fucking rock.
5843 2018-10-23 15:18:28 The last few quarters, with rising oil prices and still poor free cash flow, have been discouraging. But underwater hedges wiped out about $2 billion last quarter among independent E&Ps (and slightly less in Q1). Remove that impact and the financial picture improves immensely.

5849 2018-10-23 15:18:15 Cancel the export permits and have Canada buy them for use by our military and police forces. After all, the Cons seems to be big on cutting off the reliance on Saudi oil. Problem solved.

5860 2018-10-23 15:17:44 mayb but it was also because cooking oil was fairly priced in zim then. 3 $ something 2 litres agaist 30 rand or so for 2 litres in S.A. Those who were buying domestically will now import

What does the mkt think a ~100000 bbl/day light oil reserve rich company is worth? What doea the mkt want - a cheap take-over offer to the detriment to all.
5868 2018-10-23 15:17:19 Maybe they don’t want to wake a sleeping dragon? With global events as they are, I know I wouldn’t want to start another conflict. Of course, it’s not right, but is it the current lesser of evils?

Also, oil.
5869 2018-10-23 15:17:18 Well maybe stop importing their oil then that should be easy enough

Seven years back we had very high commodity prices plus no growth of global trade. We need to fix exports

5901 2018-10-23 15:14:45 I don’t have a problem with the tax. I have a problem that our government is paying $4.5 billion for an oil pipeline then spending 10s of billions more to complete it. Doesn’t that make our government the biggest pollution enabler in the country on reluctant taxpayer’s nickel?

5951 2018-10-23 15:10:22 Nearly every other country that does is 10% the size of ours, taxes everyone at 60%+, 1 forces everyone to buy it themselves, another has a government oil company that pays for it.

5957 2018-10-23 15:10:04 Dear MOAT Most Overrated All Time LeBron James. Last night was such a treat to watch.  Such reserved gloating on 3 to tie game, and then missing TWO free throws late followed by missing jumper to win game. LA Lakers 0-3 and heading downhill fast with old man LeBum. @Lakers @espn
5958 2018-10-23 15:10:03 China can shift oil trade to central bank and run it more similarly to how Japan did using BOJ. 

Kunlun definitely has enough business and would have gotten more as Europeans drew back. 

There must be some quid-pro-quo here.

5961 2018-10-23 15:09:40 The only person I know personally who is consistently vegan and never cheats is my dad, who has cardiovascular disease that was significantly reversed by cutting animal fat and oil out of his diet.
5962 2018-10-23 15:09:35 Tyler doesn't hate snake oil, he just has a preferred flavour.
5963 2018-10-23 15:09:31 I suppose I meant it to say something like "it opened an embassy in heaven and immediatley began drilling for oil"
5964 2018-10-23 15:09:28 It just sprays in a single jet, whatever bottle I buy and no matter where I keep it. Find myself unscrewing the top and pouring it out, defeats the object, just use olive oil instead. They are still as poor as they were when they were released.
5965 2018-10-23 15:09:16 Price on carbon, will that be used for funding oil spill clean up on BC coast? Since you don't seem interested in reopening three closed Coast Guard Centres that prevent tanker/shipping accidents.
5966 2018-10-23 15:08:58 need to get the oil changed on my jeep afternoon also. Not sure where yet.

5968 2018-10-23 15:08:53 freezing the remittances to mexico would be huge, if i remember correctly that is the #1 source of mexico’s income, brings more revenue than even oil
5969 2018-10-23 15:08:51 Nobody knows better than these guys that oil is running low & as the end of their supply gets closer & the more desperate they become, the more danger the rest of us are in. Oil money for blood money for oil money is a cycle that will be traumatic when its broken.

5973 2018-10-23 15:08:42 No matter what #SaudiArabia says, the entire world knows, it is a rouge state and hub of international terrorism. 

The only thing it has to its advantage is crude oil deposits and an strong allie in US, which matches its nefarios design to rule world oil prices.

5980 2018-10-23 15:08:14 The silver lining is that rogue elements within our country will now think a thousand times before killing any journalist or dissident. If the mighty oil rich Saudi Arabia can be put in a box what would become of our country if something like this was to happen here.

5982 2018-10-23 15:08:11 The reports I've read point to a myriad of reasons with "Jina" being an integral part of the decline.

To "complicate" matters more, there is talk of the price of oil actually coming down but I'm not prepared to take that to the bank...

Ever hear of "the squeaky  wheel gets the oil"
We are a nation of laws, lots of people are suffering all over the world, most like our ancestors defended against injustice in their own land. They did not carry our flag to invade another nation.
5988 2018-10-23 15:07:27 That's what untold amounts of money does to you, but the irony is their little kingdom will likely wind up just like Syria a once prosperous and fairly peaceful country. The oil money is running out in a few decades, and they have no way to replace that level of cash.

6007 2018-10-23 15:05:55 I go through there a lot. I just spent the weekend in Bakersfield. Like I said, years of drought, competing interests, including the oil industry. Still don’t name your state.
6008 2018-10-23 15:05:49 Alberta has historically made some of the dumbest decisions with their oil money. The less of a say they have over their own affairs the better.

6013 2018-10-23 15:05:22 Wrong. They bought a pipeline with oil already running through it and the rights to the expansion which is delayed. Trans Mountain Pipeline is now a crown corporation.
6014 2018-10-23 15:05:20 I actually recently grabbed a bottle of Army Painter's Strong Shade to try out, but I had a whole lot of Nuln Oil to use up first. Well, I guess I've got less to go through now...
6015 2018-10-23 15:05:13 Saudi Arabia has agreed to deposit $3 billion for a one-year period with the State Bank of Pakistan to help Pakistan address its deteriorating balance of payments position.

Riyadh will also provide a $3 billion deferred payment facility for oil, which will also ease BOP stress.

6065 2018-10-23 15:01:19 I'm not sure how that works. If we have Ctax and Montana doesn't. They refine our oil make $$. Nobody will build one here, in fear of Ctax raising dramatically

6082 2018-10-23 14:59:55 Comrade Jaime; I can only hope no one believes your LIES. Sun is free, oil is not free. You lie.

6090 2018-10-23 14:58:31 Two things, 1, the housing market crash was years in the making and would have happened no matter who was president. 2, Can we get Obama to put all those restrictions back on our oil production? I'm losing all my employees to the oil field since Trump has been president!
6091 2018-10-23 14:58:30 Not sure why they have you make an appointment for an oil change when you still have to wait a million years anyways...
6092 2018-10-23 14:58:29 A Democrat may want to point out that before the end of the day, the stock market will be down Y-T-D and the price of oil has risen 25% despite the "greatest economy in history". Can you imagine if Obama were to point this out? We would have a Trump valcano.
6093 2018-10-23 14:58:26 Did you see Telle’s Instagram story? His method is super good for your throat! Also a few drops of oregano oil in like a shot of water kills bacteria but make sure you take probiotics cuz it kills the good bacteria too. Feel better babe i was so sick last week i feel for you 
6094 2018-10-23 14:58:26 It’s something about a oil change that makes me want to do a road trip
6095 2018-10-23 14:58:12 I say we model our system after the best systems. Focus on preventative care instead of catastrophic. It’s like regularly changing your oil instead of waiting until your transmission dies. Incentivize it by making that part of care public while getting gap coverage for the rest.

I know it's a huge transition & a major financial shift...but I also know they should've seen this coming.

They've been profiting off an already in place infrastructure for oil for decades, while completely ignoring the changing market.

6137 2018-10-23 14:54:57 No, find more. Find out why that’s happening. Find out what greenhouse gases are and how coal and oil play into it. Get the complete picture for the argument the. Determine whether it’s believable. Read a whole article from researchers. Ask yourself why they would lie to you
6138 2018-10-23 14:54:44 Henry I still remember very vividly when @seunokin interviewed Buhari. He said, he will stabilize the oil price in the international market.
He said he will bring 1Naira to 1 dollar ,that he doesn't believe in Subsidy.
He said those dumbest things.

6149 2018-10-23 14:54:06 No it's not all or nothing. Its use everything you can ,wind solar, natural gas oil . But develope the cleaner energy source until it is affordable for even the poorest among us. Right now it's not and no government program will make it so. Only the free market will.

6152 2018-10-23 14:53:45 They are the popular importers of cooking oil and basic consumer products in Ethiopia. Check Ethiopian import data and you will see the companies. I am not sure if EFFORT is part of them though.

6157 2018-10-23 14:53:12 It's just embarrassing for the #powerai team at @ibm (including smart folks like @chuckcalio) that @soutros was either unethical in endorsing the @Invacio scam for money, or was actually fooled by such obvious snake oil.
6158 2018-10-23 14:53:06 sure you checked but when Duncan no nuts got sprayed I used a mixture of peroxide/blue dawn/teatrea essential oil.  worked like a dream.  except he took it up the nose so his breath had quite a stank

6177 2018-10-23 14:51:50 It’s never too late for thoughtful responses to global issues. 

#EnergyEast has very little to do w/ your “transition” agenda (which will occur naturally w/ advances in BOTH technology and economics) and everything to do with replacing imported oil with thoughtful  oil.

6202 2018-10-23 14:49:37 Maybe service companies are going to increase prices, so shale oil production costs wil increase as well and so breakeven prices. Less productive areas will likely suffer investment cuts

6205 2018-10-23 14:49:14 No es cierto, esas plantas cobran por generación instalada apagadas o generando. 

Lo cierto es q con más generación barata el gobierno no tendrá q gastar más d nuestro dinero subsidiando la compra de energía generada con gasoil o fuel oil. 

Pero ese ahorro no te lo pasan a ti

6208 2018-10-23 14:49:06 It’s not quite the same.  Right now we don’t make enough to afford the lifestyle we live in Alberta.  Something has to change, Alberta has a diverse economy already, however Oil and Gas is our largest sector, and we should be working to promote it.
6209 2018-10-23 14:49:01 Us oil producers have to stick together?
6210 2018-10-23 14:49:01 I got big dreams. Straight to a Fortune 500 Chemical or oil company in operations and eventually applied process engineering. I ask God for help.
6211 2018-10-23 14:48:55 Perhaps you should comment on the access or lack thereof to Canadian oil, which forces or encourages these private companies to get oil internationally. Who is responsible for the lack of access? Trudeau.

Or do you think these companies should just shut down?
6212 2018-10-23 14:48:52 How long can you push off an oil change? Asking for a friend ....

6220 2018-10-23 14:48:11 Are you sure? Because till the time fuel prices were controlled by central govt, everyday we used to read in newspapers that oil companies are in great danger of shutting down due to subsidy given to common man.
6221 2018-10-23 14:48:09 Thats creepy asf. Aint nothing like that been happening. Yall better call the Ancestors, Orishas, and God for protection. Go get yall some protection oil.
6222 2018-10-23 14:47:58 I've been silent on the Saudi Arabia alleged murder. This is some barbarian level stuff. Really we should sever the kiss kiss hug hug. I've long complained of their head chopping. What's a country gotta do to get sanctioned when they got 10% of global oil production?
6223 2018-10-23 14:47:56 thats my thinking.

6225 2018-10-23 14:47:53 since when did the gov start buying oil? I didn't realize Irving oil was the government.
6226 2018-10-23 14:47:46 Isn't it weird that THE MIDDLE EAST, 
THEIR flag and THEIR culture offend
so many OF US AMERICANS, 
but THEIR OIL don't.
6227 2018-10-23 14:47:33 Protect and Preserve you kingdom covenants. The enemy comes to Divide and Conquer.
There is strength and oil in unity.
Be watchful
6228 2018-10-23 14:47:25 I don’t ‘feel ‘ about fracking I’m stating facts. You say you are from Texas, go drive the same roads the oil and water trucks use, go breath the methane gas from fracking operations. Wait for the next 3.1 earthquake to hit San Antonio. Then we will talk.

6232 2018-10-23 14:47:17 That’s true- their isthmus production has been declining and they are working towards blending lighter barrels with olmecca or maya to increase the API as they want more distillates not fuel oil or resides

6236 2018-10-23 14:47:08 Well you could add 2 things to you Modi hate list. 
1) currency value of falling
2) High fuel prises even though Crude oil prices have not raised in enough to support its price (3/3)
6237 2018-10-23 14:47:06 I need a oil change and my emissions test done

6240 2018-10-23 14:46:39 The prophet Elisha summoned a man from the company of the prophets and said to him, “Tuck your cloak into your belt, take this flask of olive oil with you and go to Ramoth Gilead..

Prophets:
Get ready, God is not sending you to raise money, He's sending you to raise a JEHU!
6241 2018-10-23 14:46:25 I am happy to say that this oil trade from last Thursday's show has reached its target --Think the market could bounce --but that could provide opp to sell as I think oil will trade into the low 60 handle by the end of the year --#oott
6242 2018-10-23 14:46:24 Y’all niggas really need to start taking y’all girl cars to get oil changes every few months or cash app her the money. I’m tired of them coming here with these fucked up cars

6249 2018-10-23 14:45:54 Right back at you @KimmieChan1995 .  Have you done any research on the benefits of CBD Oil?  Or are you a close-minded person who isn't willing to consider it because you relate it to Marijuana.
6250 2018-10-23 14:45:41 Conversely we have a unique opportunity with cannabis and renewable fuels and bio-plastics, why wouldn't it be more lucrative to invest into hemp and build an all Canadian energy solution that gives resources from Canadian soil to Canadian citizens. Revenue from oil could help.
6251 2018-10-23 14:45:34 sigh. that and “glad i managed to get the oil changed this week before my car blew up!”

6253 2018-10-23 14:45:17 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
6254 2018-10-23 14:45:14 All I came for was an oil change and new brakes and ended up with 500+ dollars of work needing to be done 
6255 2018-10-23 14:45:14 It shouldn't take that long to photocopy the LPC Plan: tax carbon, raise prices for consumers & funnel more corporate welfare to elites, while not meeting any environmental targets. Also, continue to export our carbon at a discount & import oil from Middle East at world prices.

6258 2018-10-23 14:44:56 3 things I’m picking from this:

1) Don’t eat something spicy food while talking to investors about Nigeria for now

2) Like the recent Saudi incident, 9ja committed rookie [financial] blunder.

3) It was avoidable, like the oil pipeline blast that was not well managed
6259 2018-10-23 14:44:55 J’ai si hâte de tester le body oil, j’ai craqué dessus. J’ai entendu que du bien sur les masques. Je te dirai.
6260 2018-10-23 14:44:54 Mas masarap pag baby oil.
6261 2018-10-23 14:44:33 Very true. But it goes much much deeper too. Saudi has & it appears always (until the oil runs out or we stop using it) will have a “seat amongst decision makers”. Very sad example of how this world is run
6262 2018-10-23 14:44:29 we always make sure to rub baby oil on the sebooty to maintain its smoothness

6266 2018-10-23 14:44:20 Scott, when are you going to call on the feds to #BoycottSaudiOil. Are you comfortable with Canada buying oil from a country that bombed a school bus full of kids or murders journalists? Should we buy Saudi oil while Canadian energy workers sit unemployed?
6267 2018-10-23 14:44:17 @LizCrokin One thing that Trump said last night at his rally really struck a cord with me and is So POWERFUL! America is #EnergyIndependant

6270 2018-10-23 14:44:09 All of a sudden we no longer hear about PPPRA, independent marketers, PENGASSAN and many other cabals holding the oil & gas sector to ransom in the past. 

Many emergency billionaires emerged from the fraudulent activities of these cabals

6278 2018-10-23 14:43:09 Pretty amazing that @soutros endorsed (and implied his employer's endorsement of) such obvious snake oil in exchange for a little money, and @ibm didn't fire him.
6279 2018-10-23 14:43:09 Crazy....And back in 16 no one was doing any investment in oil drilling.

6288 2018-10-23 14:42:17 Ya think? Why people think we should is beyond me. We can get oil from other sources. Last time I checked, we supposedly don't negotiate with terrorists....and yet here we are.

6290 2018-10-23 14:42:11 Just think if people had & were using those alternatives right now, Cleaner Air, Cheaper, Safer, & the best thing, if World events caused the Pricing of Oil & Gas 2 sky-rocket, it wouldn't matter because we wouldn't be dependent on it, due to using those better alternatives?????
6291 2018-10-23 14:42:07 Yes, the corner will be a CBD oil shop themed like 1800s pharmacy & next door, Larison Media.
6292 2018-10-23 14:42:04 It's a message. It's domestic purpose is to tell Saudi's with any nuance of dissident views, that he can make their children into orphans. As for international reaction, he's got his hand on the tap that pours out 18% of the world's oil.
6293 2018-10-23 14:41:53 Actually breading = wheat (plant based), Vegetable oil comes from plants, if I am not mistaken.
6294 2018-10-23 14:41:44 Will look at it. But Saudi Arabia fight oil up
6295 2018-10-23 14:41:42 We don't live in a country where bombs and Guns are roaring. There's no country in the middle east that is best to live. Saudi is no exception. We don't have refugees. We are happy than you think.. You get Money from piligrim and Oil selling e.t.c but you are not happy citizens.

6298 2018-10-23 14:41:35 In college we learned that the politics in Saudi Arabia is controlled by Wahhabis, a violent, fundamentalist, Puritanical sect of Islam, and that Saudi oil money has buttressed this relationship for decades.

Given the news of these past few weeks, did something change? No?
6299 2018-10-23 14:41:35 No oil...
6300 2018-10-23 14:41:33 What they need to ask is how do the states start generating IGR?
And I have an idea here...
Let those allocated oil blocs to few individuals be abolished hand over to states to manage.
Those port terminals that were shared among few should as be allocated to state to manage.
6301 2018-10-23 14:41:33 Not even. Landing cost for 2ltrs cooking oil is US$3 = $9 Bond

1) Climate change isn’t coming for us all.
2) Oil is a totally unlimited resource.
3) There will not be increasing moral and other costs to doing biz w/ Saudis
6305 2018-10-23 14:41:20 Anyone wanna spend the day driving me places knowing half y’all you need an oil change and that is what I will exchange in return

As far as I know there's no local stores that sell CBD infused lotion or massage oil. What brand is it & maybe I can find it online.
6309 2018-10-23 14:41:12 there's gotta be enough olive oil for the both of us
6310 2018-10-23 14:41:04 So somehow Canada’s 3% of the oil production is going to do it? Have you spent any time pursuing the transshipment of American coal through Vancouver? You don’t drive? You don’t use any plastic items? You don’t purchase anything? Time to drop the holier than thou bs.
6311 2018-10-23 14:41:02 Thinking abt the Hungarian girl in my marketing class and how angry she gets that I have anxiety and spend all class picking at the sides of my nails LMFAOOOOOO she really fckin bought oil to put on your fingers to stop biting and picking and she put it right next to me .
6312 2018-10-23 14:40:55 The Liberal Government denied the energy east pipeline, which would have stopped or curbed imports of Saudi oil. What does Chystia Freeland have to say about that?

Plastic is made from crude oil. And crude oil is the remains of ancient human civilizations. Suck it up 
6329 2018-10-23 14:39:37 Jeremy Corbyn has said unequivocally that a Labour government would ban fracking and arms sales to Saudi Arabia. That's what you get from an incorruptible politician who can't be bought by oil companies and arms manufacturers. It also explains why corrupt neoliberals hate him.
6330 2018-10-23 14:39:28 Energy workers sit unemployed? Should we buy oil from a country that literally has no environmental protection protocol?
6331 2018-10-23 14:39:27 He proved his hatred for Albertan's and contempt for all Western Canadians[except lower mainland BC] on about his very first day in office when he put an embargo on oil tankers off the West Coast.

6337 2018-10-23 14:38:54 Thanks captain obvious. Next time we will list all the private firms buying foreign oil because they are forced to because we can’t get pipelines built so they access #democracyoil from CANADA. Or, we will shorten it to “Canada” cause it’s obvious.
6338 2018-10-23 14:38:51 Yeah, gotta get that oil. Saudi Arabia doesn’t have any oil though so 
6339 2018-10-23 14:38:49 Are you okay? Need oil white stick?
6340 2018-10-23 14:38:44 Should we also ask which oil to use? What if they say use electric diyas?

6345 2018-10-23 14:38:24 I hate plastic. It’s on everything, everywhere. Pharma replaced homeopathy just so Rockefeller could make $$ from his petroleum byproducts. Just in case you didn’t know, plastic is made from oil. The same oil that fossil fuel is refined for.
6346 2018-10-23 14:38:22 Fed will never waste a good crisis. Cheap oil is QE to attempt to save the economy from bad policy.

6358 2018-10-23 14:37:29 Apparently caster oil is good for your hair too.
6359 2018-10-23 14:37:24 This guy is sleazy. Even before I knew he was a tRump supporter just by his commercials I knew he was a snake oil salesman. 
Won’t buy his shitty pillow. Ain’t buying his shitty product “tRump.”
6360 2018-10-23 14:37:23 i want a barrel of oil for christmas

6362 2018-10-23 14:37:22 Angela Merkel seems to have all the proof she needs. Russians were expelled before the evidence was clear.
Money and oil are the only reasons why we haven't acted.
6363 2018-10-23 14:37:21 That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil.

KJV. Deuteronomy 11:14
6364 2018-10-23 14:37:05 It's okay, dear. I won't judge you for that. You need support + to keep your brain active. Cod liver oil and puzzle books.
6365 2018-10-23 14:37:00 下げたときに買えとは言うが、それができないのが大半の投資家で、普段相手にしてる大半は「大半の投資家」だから相場が悪けりゃ数字もでないんじゃ
6366 2018-10-23 14:36:56 Oh we can wait me and you CTREK (do you like trekking ?)
Once they are gone then happy days.
6367 2018-10-23 14:36:45 WTF is there to disapprove? And don’t even go to the racist, misogynist B.S. Disapprove of low unemployment, using our own oil, fair trade, booming economy, lower taxes, soaring stocks, wage increases? Dipsticks!
6368 2018-10-23 14:36:26 So the same people who are panic buying cooking oil are the ones selling it on the black market for a profit..hayas
6369 2018-10-23 14:36:26 Supports the hypothesis that the Ghawar oil field is depleted.
6370 2018-10-23 14:36:18 For healthy shiny hair use a hot oil treatment once a week.
6371 2018-10-23 14:36:09 LOL - that ship has sailed you snake oil salesman. Dems want open borders. Notice the silence as this mob is heading toward the border from the Dems? <crickets> <crickets>
6372 2018-10-23 14:36:08 Massacre in oil today...Even I am getting hurt for the first time in this selloff now. This drop from 69.60 to 67.50 is also catching me. I am staying long but it does not look pretty.
6373 2018-10-23 14:36:04 Cooking eggs using coconut oil is a game changer 
6374 2018-10-23 14:36:00 Any of you guys ever spray fish oil on your dog's food? Heard great things about it
6375 2018-10-23 14:35:57 No, I want to use it for massage oil at home
6376 2018-10-23 14:35:39 I mean let’s be real I’m not gonna tell someone to rub cbd oil on their toes for their diabetes and heart disease. But if someone is working hard and losing weight I’m not going to stop them, but only make sure it’s done in a healthy way.

6379 2018-10-23 14:35:26 Yes, I love the Eucalyptus Dives essential oil! I use it along with Rosalina and Cypress to make the chest rub. Happy Birthday planttherapy! 
6380 2018-10-23 14:35:21 The Eastern Carpetbaggers live in a dream world of getting handouts and shock every time 100 people lose their jobs, but job losses in the tens of thousands in the oil and gas business; crickets.
6381 2018-10-23 14:35:15 Unfortunately there’s very little habitat left for elephants in Indonesia. Courtesy largely of the wonderful palm oil industry. Absolutely shameful.

6383 2018-10-23 14:35:05 Baklava costs 5 times as much as petrol. So even after the Middle East runs out of oil, colonialists will be invading the region for the baklava.

6389 2018-10-23 14:34:43 It probably is. I usually get emails every month about the cars diagnostics. It tells me if I’m in need of an oil change, things like that.

6391 2018-10-23 14:34:32 anyone around here that has tried CBD oil wanna give me some insight bc i’m curious
6392 2018-10-23 14:34:31 Samin, Thanks for sharing this recipe! I found one similar on line but, it included olive oil in the brine. You are AMAZEBALLS!~
6393 2018-10-23 14:34:30 Venezuela moved away from the petrol dollar. Look what happens to other countries who have large oil reserves that attempt this.
6394 2018-10-23 14:34:19 Real leaders make the hard decisions. @CanadianPM doesn’t make hard decisions. If three years has thought us anything it's that.

Cancel the deal, hurts us, stop importing their oil hurts them. But a hard decision would be out of character.

6397 2018-10-23 14:33:50 It’s one of two things. Either total stupidity or total arrogance. I vote the latter. Saudis are confident their money and oil will allow them to get away with anything.
6398 2018-10-23 14:33:46 If you start using artisanal beard oil turn in your Italian card.

6400 2018-10-23 14:33:38 @VinnieTortorich I live in Baton Rouge, you would think asking for food that doesn't involve bread, cornmeal, or being fried in peanut oil was violating somebody's religious doctrine.  I'm still going to pay the same for a hamburger with bacon and cheese without a bun and fries!
6401 2018-10-23 14:33:33 Sana oil hahaha pero yoko nyan lasing agad ako dyan hahaha
6402 2018-10-23 14:33:25 I’m not buying what any Republican /Nationalist snake oil  salesmen is selling.
6403 2018-10-23 14:33:17 The CBD oil I ordered online was seemingly reliable without a return address & somebody else's name. They were called & I questioned one recipient. He said he opened it & it was an electronic device. His name is not John. All those suspicious packages that Austin TX had exploded.
6404 2018-10-23 14:33:17 I used raw blanched almonds, then post them in olive oil. those are really nice, but also considerably more expensive than the slivered ones.
6405 2018-10-23 14:33:14 It also interesting that when @CBCNews asks Trudeau “tough” question about the LAV contract and Saudi’s but no mention of cutting of the use of Saudi oil and replacing it with Canadian.
6406 2018-10-23 14:33:12 サリエリちゃんをまぜないでェ(むせた)
6407 2018-10-23 14:33:10 45 minutes before my Network Fundamentals Certification test. I'm a nervous wreck and just doubled my CBD oil intake. I'm actually fearing failing this test. Never had this problem before. I need a drink
6408 2018-10-23 14:33:06 That would be a dream scenario for me. Trudeau pisses off Saudi Arabia, they cut off oil shipments, eastern provinces run out of oil, and then people rise up and demand asshat Trudeau steps down as PM. Ahhh, perfect
6409 2018-10-23 14:33:05 They don’t hold the same leverage with oil anymore. Using it, will only accelerate the move away from gasoline. I would take that risk.
6410 2018-10-23 14:33:03 If companies or cities would be proactive and followed like Tesla did with supercharger network. Then it could be done by 2030 but not realistically..oil/gas companies will slow it done all they can though.
6411 2018-10-23 14:32:58 In terms of non oil production and manufacturing, the South East top n champion our produced or made in Nigeria exports 
Infact Nexim bank claims 60% of non oil export funds are shared between the Ogun Mid belt and the South East
6412 2018-10-23 14:32:46 While Venezuela remains under the control of Cuba and PDVSA the Venezuelan state owned oil company production hits lower records in oil extraction Saudi Arabia has the lead.
PDVSA is at the service of obscure interests of the international left and of traditional US enemies.
6413 2018-10-23 14:32:40 Ayieee sana oil
6414 2018-10-23 14:32:35 In short gvt is now saying we have failed to provide foreign currency for the importation of raw materials for cooking oil etc so citizens if you have the money please go and buy yourself. Sorry citizens already "burnt" their USD all they have is RTGS and banks can't clear TTs.

6416 2018-10-23 14:32:15 Hey I agree with you B.C, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba should all separate from Canada! That way  Eastern Canada doesn’t get a bad name from us westerners! But you will not get any royalties from the oil anymore, nor will you get and equalization payment for your province!
6417 2018-10-23 14:32:15 The only reason I can think that he hates treaties so much is because he hates any limits on the US using its might.  But to what end? Is he the most conscious proponent of #endlesswar out there? You don't even need to rationalize it to him with jobs and oil prices.

6420 2018-10-23 14:32:01 We’ve been in persistent crises in the Middle East since 1976. You would think that what’s going on right now should be called Tuesday. The constant conflict and embargoes have not stopped a significant flow of oil but speculators who never touched a drop have raked in billions
6421 2018-10-23 14:32:00 Kenny's speech last night also underscored the need for a pipeline to Atlantic Canada to gain full value of our oil industry which is currently selling for deep discounts to the US and achieve energy independence. @AIMS_CA
6422 2018-10-23 14:31:52 #SoylentData alert at Mozilla sponsored  #icdppc2018 side event. Personal data is not “like oil” or “a natural resource”. IT’S PEOPLE!”
6423 2018-10-23 14:31:52 The Saudis are talking the oil market down to make Trump happy for the midterms. After we get through that forget any more talk of "selling whatever it takes".
6424 2018-10-23 14:31:49 I wonder what is the thinking in selling midstream today?  Are they pumping 2% less oil today

2. US Sec. Mnuchin gave a photo opp, 
3. despite fallout Saudis received about 50 bn USD pledge on Davos in the Desert
4. Moscow secured an oil investment in RU
6427 2018-10-23 14:31:33 Nice rise again today but clearly Bergen still selling

6437 2018-10-23 14:30:39 Try Virgin Coconut Oil. Might help. Worked for a friend, but must be diligent.
6438 2018-10-23 14:30:34 I own one, I love it. It’s never left me stranded, and if you do most of the work yourself it’s affordable to maintain, if I ignore the oil, power steering fluid and coolant leaking

6448 2018-10-23 14:29:47 oil cleanser?
6449 2018-10-23 14:29:41 If a car an inanimate object needs a oil change or regular maintenance; what makes you think that you a HUMAN being can go days, weeks, months, and years without having God do matinece on your heart. Going forever without reading your bible is deadly.  
6450 2018-10-23 14:29:24 Funny USA dropped gold standard as soon as they realised middle East had enough oil to buy all the gold on earth and more.
6451 2018-10-23 14:29:23 Shannon Ahmad did claimed that Zahid Komedi is only as skillful as a snake oil salesman.

Since you are very surprised with Komedi's ignorance, it is clear that you probably have not read Shannon's comments about UMNO's top brass in the 90s
6452 2018-10-23 14:29:21 Mayor Webb apparently isn’t familiar with US oil & gas exports. Do you want to enlighten him?

6454 2018-10-23 14:29:17 25 bond for 5litres of cooking oil. Is this okay? Or I should just buy?
6455 2018-10-23 14:29:09 Counterpoint: considering crypto is all fraud, marketing and spin is all they have. May the best snake oil salesperson win.
6456 2018-10-23 14:29:06 I love cumin too, but we mostly use it whole to flavour the oil to cook in. Or we roast them and then ground them into powder to use in dishes. I'm not sure how you would use it, is it the same?
6457 2018-10-23 14:29:04 You’re covered in Olive Oil?
6458 2018-10-23 14:29:01 かっこいい！なんのグッズですか？

6460 2018-10-23 14:28:56 レート120ぐらいが限界
6461 2018-10-23 14:28:48 Will this help the situation. Yes on the shortage side not on price. Remember we have bond notes and you need to buy the foreign currency from the black market. Cooking Oil for example is going for R2.60 in SA which is about 4 Bond using the current black market rate
6462 2018-10-23 14:28:46 it's a secret...but myrrh oil diluted in jojoba and almond oils, also anything with lactic acid!
6463 2018-10-23 14:28:44 Unfortunate as it is, however such things do happen all over the world, since oil prices are becoming an issue for the free world hence the targeting of only one country and forcing explanations where acceptance was enough and the world should have moved on like always IMO.
6464 2018-10-23 14:28:30 Isn't the oil we seek from fossils...fossil fuel.  I was once told that it came from dinosaurs
6465 2018-10-23 14:28:29 But PETA is against “factory” cow/milk - butter - BUT General Mills Puff Pastry ingredients- ENRICHED FLOUR (WHEAT FLOUR, MALTED BARLEY FLOUR, NIACIN, IRON, THIAMIN MONONITRATE, RIBOFLAVIN, FOLIC ACID), PALM OIL AND SOYBEANOIL, WATER, SALT, MONOCALCIUM PHOSPHATE.
6466 2018-10-23 14:28:12 It is true that Zimbabwe has mineral resources but not the quick selling type:oil& uranium. Besides,Zims resources are already cornered by the Chinese. Biya/France has some chunk of oil stolen from Biafraland and handed to him by Obj through the International Court of Injustice
6467 2018-10-23 14:28:10 Because I’ll tell you what it looks like, it looks like you’re still fighting for oil. Tesla is responsible for finally winning that one and you decide to stand in the way? Sad for America.
6468 2018-10-23 14:28:09 So let them get away with it because of oil.  Brilliant idea, NOT !
6469 2018-10-23 14:28:01 frankincense oil kind of smells like pickle juice and...I am not mad about it! i WILL continue putting her on my face<3
6470 2018-10-23 14:28:00 @waitrose Could you tell me why your "All Butter Mince Pies" contain palm oil, please?  Surely the name is misleading when palm oil is listed in the ingredients?
6471 2018-10-23 14:27:52 I use bio oil and the Rose hip collection by essano
6472 2018-10-23 14:27:46 Oil is so much better than acrylic
6473 2018-10-23 14:27:46 Brid you need to become better informed.Yes plastic pollutes but we produce 30% less food because it preserves and protects.Less fertiliser, less traffic,less diesel,less  methane from cattle.Its not a simple zero sum. Its a recycling and mostly an end user issue.Oil refining.
6474 2018-10-23 14:27:31 Gold still rising and oil still falling..
6475 2018-10-23 14:27:27 Gold still rising and oil still falling..

6483 2018-10-23 14:26:46 I don’t see that ever happening!  Trump seems to want low oil prices.  Crush oil sector to help rest of economy.  I wish he would become supportive of oil companies.
6484 2018-10-23 14:26:41 Start on the coconut oil, young lady!
6485 2018-10-23 14:26:35 何時かい？
6486 2018-10-23 14:26:33 So you were vehemently opposed to pipelines before you became Premier. Now that you know you're likely out of a job in May not only are you championing pipelines but advocating that we move MORE oil by rail, the most dangerous way to do so. Careful, your desperation is showing.

6493 2018-10-23 14:26:09 Amendment 74 reportedly is polling well. If it passes, the oil and gas industry will have succeeded in taking a wrecking ball to Colorado government, all in retaliation against residents trying to protect the health and safety of their neighborhoods.
6494 2018-10-23 14:26:07 Do we need their oil and military purchases so much that we can rationalize a degree of inhumanity for which there is no descriptive word. Dismiss their ambassador and cut off all ties.
6495 2018-10-23 14:26:06 Steep drop of SLB, APA, SN, CPG, GUSH... What is most disturbing is that the ratio of stocks to the oil price is plunging as well. This means stocks are falling faster than oil. #OOTT

6498 2018-10-23 14:26:03 Fake news creator d are. How can a country that was almost 100% import dependent and paying with oil sales dollar have such values? Nobody has shown where and who made that promise. It is just like  "we will attack Israel" story believed by some people.

6502 2018-10-23 14:25:39 Govt should also look into the ways how to reduce the oil consumption in Pakistan as it is on the top if our imports. Measure such as free or reduce duty for fully electric and  hybrid vehicles. Invite international manufactures to come Pak & bring electric and hybrid car tech
6503 2018-10-23 14:25:37 He Speaks. Foolishly I might add. Well let's reply the foolish one. 2014 Ebelle Jonathan administration oil bench mark was 78$ to a barrel. 2015 under Ebelle Jonathan (last budget) oil bench mark for 2015 budget fell to 65$ a barrel. Which means the economy was already drowning.

El Salvador, Honduras, and Venezuela are failed states requiring military intervention to restore order. @realDonaldTrump, The United States and our allies should use military intervention for good.

6628 2018-10-23 14:14:52 I already gave you the answer. You seem to not grasp that crude oil and gasoline are two completely different commodities with completely different markets.

To appreciate the difference, why not buy yourself a barrel of crude and try to make your own gasoline from it? Good luck.

6633 2018-10-23 14:14:18 That may be true but you see the 50s wear different thing yes maybe for oil however, which would you rather have had the shah or Khomeini? A duly elected government yes is best, between the two the Shah of Iran. Did he imprison people was he on the edge of evil yes- compare now
6634 2018-10-23 14:14:08 You are definitely in the solid minority these days. I field SO MANY calls that go "I'm 100 miles over/under my sticker am I okay??" "Well what's your oil level like." "??? you expect me to CHECK MY OWN OIL!???!?"

6647 2018-10-23 14:13:25 Do you feel stressed through the day? Your cortisol levels could be too high before bed. You could try magnesium, meditating or stretching, or even CBD oil if you haven’t tried that.

6651 2018-10-23 14:13:04 The #Saudis have destroyed #Yemen, killed 3000 Americans and now #Khashoggi. They'll get away with it free and clear, because #Trump needs oil to speed up climate change and #Erdogan needs to save his economy from his own graft and greed. Money keeps the world going 'round. Greed

6656 2018-10-23 14:12:12 @jokowi Singapura sdh lama punya pabrik Green Diesel di Tuas yg dimiliki oleh Neste Oil, perusahaan asal Finlandia. Neste Oil punya 3 pabrik GD yg berlokasi di Finland, Singapore dan Amsterdam. Ayo Pak action, jangan tunggu crude oil melambung dan Rp tersungkur lebih dalam.

6659 2018-10-23 14:11:56 But... those are predominantly oil companies. They produce the fuel that goes into people's cars, plane rides and central heating. Are they to blame for people's consumption?
6660 2018-10-23 14:11:41 s/o to the chicks who get there oil changed regularly. All 8 of y’all
6661 2018-10-23 14:11:34 After inhaling all the oil smell, I decided to skip dinner #totheskinnyme
6662 2018-10-23 14:11:29 I guess you couldn't read the last line in the original tweet? CANADA doesn't control oil imported by private or publically traded oil companies. What part of THAT don't you understand? That has NOTHING to do with the gov't OR Trudeau. Your partisanship alters reality for you.
6663 2018-10-23 14:11:29 touching the hands of anyone who regularly uses hand lotion/oil/cream is so wild cuz my hands feel like sandpaper compared to theirs. tf
6664 2018-10-23 14:11:25 Canacol is a calgary operations expert that runs nat gas and oil ops in Latin America. Colombia is the focus and gas sell for more there than the USA spot price so margins are really good and the market is growing. They will grow very fast in next 4-5 years.
6665 2018-10-23 14:11:22 
6666 2018-10-23 14:11:14 And awful price action within oil services and overall energy sector :)

PLEASE
6672 2018-10-23 14:10:32 It's best not to listen to snake oil salesmen.  Plenty of times in history,  doctors and scientists have promoted outright falsehoods and quackery.  This is one

heating and materials still needs lots of oil.
We have to eat right?
6676 2018-10-23 14:10:17 You're already off on the wrong paw if you look for oil at autozone :3
6677 2018-10-23 14:10:13 U re a confused and bitter Nigerian..carry ur frustration don’t come and inflict me with it abeg ...Was the SS not surviving with other regions resources before they discovered oil?
6678 2018-10-23 14:10:03 'Rebels' aka UK US Proxies, sent in to destabilise and wreck havoc, by killing and maiming innocent civilians. All to enable the bankers to steal the oil? Look at Genie Oil, Golan Heights, owned by Rothschild, Cheney & Murdoch!
6679 2018-10-23 14:10:02 US indices at low for the day, European indices extending losses. Oil down sharply but gold and silver trading sharply higher.

6685 2018-10-23 14:09:31 So then lets stop buying their oil.  Or did Harper lock us into that deal too?
6686 2018-10-23 14:09:25 Or believe the climate scientist and their computer models(exagerated based on actual recorded data) from non oil/coal producing countries? You have the same possible political/economic influence from all views. One is just more popular now.

6696 2018-10-23 14:08:45 Just until 2020 so the Snake Oil salesman has time to get out of town.
6697 2018-10-23 14:08:36 Being frank, all the US is doing right now is buying it's own stock and dumping factories into low wage Asian markets to try and maximize profits.

Also, the oil that tanks that your boss hipped us to despite the warning of economists is a weird argument to bitch to Trudeau for.
6698 2018-10-23 14:08:32 Oil prices going down with everything else, now all F500 companies can buy all their stocks back lol

6704 2018-10-23 14:07:20 5) residential areas, oil & gas is funding a measure that will cost the taxpayers enormous $$$ for litigation and claims for compensation.
6705 2018-10-23 14:07:19 But the corrupt Shah was put into power by the West looong before #Carter! And he was put there with the help of big Western #oil companies. #Iran
6706 2018-10-23 14:07:17 This is a foolish liberal message that is making its way around Twitter.   They don’t buy the oil but they hinder Canadians ability to ship it, to sell it.  Energy easy was fully funded and approved  and oil would have found market.  Can’t disentangle hypocrisy for convenience
6707 2018-10-23 14:07:17 I do both the CBD oil and smoke weed. I don't mind the hallucinogenic effects as long as I follow EXACTLY what type I need to buy (indica, no hybrid, more CBD than THC if possible). I've been doing this for a long time tbh
6708 2018-10-23 14:07:12 I don’t have access to coconut oil and probably won’t have time tomorrow but that’s a very helpful tip, thank you!!
6709 2018-10-23 14:07:11 Oil falls by $2 after Saudi Arabia reassures market on supply
6710 2018-10-23 14:07:04 sounds funy add oil
6711 2018-10-23 14:06:56 Agreed. The only thing that worries me is that this is market consensus (futures prices point down, market is expecting 2m barrels from the permian basin middle-end of 2019 as the pipeline gets ready) ..risks are Iran oil supply, possible Saudi sanctions etc
6712 2018-10-23 14:06:55 TOTH: SPX 1H moves slightly higher after large gap down on open.

6716 2018-10-23 14:06:43 Better for you to learn the working of GST Council. Govt can't take one sided decision regarding GST. Increase in excise duty was a must to pay the oil bonds taken by the UPA Govt. Moreover the earned money was invested in infrastructure development.

6719 2018-10-23 14:06:29 Do not allow a barrel of Iranian oil to be exported to India and other countries, since all these money is either plundered or spent on terrorism, it will never be spent on our people. Exemption is a gift to the terrorist regime of Iran to extend its disgraceful life.
6720 2018-10-23 14:06:28 Too bad the establishment is hooked on oil money.
6721 2018-10-23 14:06:26 Just beat my previous record of oil chugging my 3 quarts ! I prefer motorcraft heavy duty over shell rotella or mobil vactrax
6722 2018-10-23 14:06:24 Yikes ma oil menu dun eh
6723 2018-10-23 14:06:09 I sholl need to go get my oil changed
6724 2018-10-23 14:05:56 You dont go nuke on this...cut back on Saudi oil imports
6725 2018-10-23 14:05:44 Saudi team arrived a day before Khashoggi's killing, consulate cameras removed, Erdogan says:== It's sickening that the US is hostage to the Saudis for oil! They are terrorists crooks ! I'd tell them to pour a bowl of sand and cover it with oil  and eat it!!!   Go to hell Saudi
6726 2018-10-23 14:05:42 I just got my breaks changed like 2 weeks ago. I need to get my oil leak fixed but 1 step at a time lol
6727 2018-10-23 14:05:40 Houston is home to more fortune 500 companies than any coty other than New York. 8% of houstonians make 1 million or more dollars per year. Oil and gas has always been important.
6728 2018-10-23 14:05:37 My friend makes banana bread with cannabis infused coconut oil. Daniel deserves a nice big slice of that and a comfy chair in a quiet spot. He's been a Godsend.
6729 2018-10-23 14:05:10 @ABDanielleSmith There are new regulations on Oil tanker cars coming through on Nov. 1st, thus reducing the amount of oil being shipped by rail . Notley is full of shit !!
6730 2018-10-23 14:05:08 Both change the oil and fill the water in the car
6731 2018-10-23 14:05:01 The gas tax increase in the 2016 budget was a de facto carbon tax (on gasoline only). What I want to see is carbon tax extended to heating oil and industrial emitters.
6732 2018-10-23 14:04:56 Unfortunately I think you’re wrong about MBS and Trump. The bone saw was just a speed bump, much like Access Hollywood tape. As long as the economy is doing well and SA is dumping cash in (by selling oil that’s destroying our atmosphere), things will return to biz as usual.
6733 2018-10-23 14:04:50 What's an emo person's favorite oil to cook with?
 
Panic! at the Crisco
6734 2018-10-23 14:04:47 It’s all about me. Oil WELLS are much more friendly to our environment. Fracking is horrible. Tariffs placed on the solar industry have retarded it’s growth while China has expanded their solar industry dramatically.
6735 2018-10-23 14:04:38 And are libs prepared to open up new protected areas to drill for oil?
6736 2018-10-23 14:04:19 Do you know the per càpita oil consumption in USA? The oil consumption is bigger than oil produción, so they/ you do need more oil. Everiybody knows It.
6737 2018-10-23 14:04:15 直さん～
6738 2018-10-23 14:04:11 Sunlight is free.  Oddly enough so is the wind.  How difficult is it for people to  move out of the 20th century and realize we don't need their oil.  We don't need their money.  Even if they didn't dismember a journalist while he was still alive.
6739 2018-10-23 14:04:09 sorry to all the people who hate the smell of tea tree oil at my school bc i have lots of pimples that need to be dealt with

6746 2018-10-23 14:03:42 And China stopped buying US oil- 20% of the entire US market.
6747 2018-10-23 14:03:34 The money  gov it's gets from Scotland is dwafed by the square mile of London. If Scotland want to be independent fine with me but it will end up like brexit, but good luck setting up your own currency and when the oil runs out plus take your share of debt.
6748 2018-10-23 14:03:22 This is exactly how he is using our crude oil revenue to build up the North, leaving the East so dilapidated and after that barbaric act an Hausa man will be clamouring for one Nigeria. He must be insane.
6749 2018-10-23 14:03:21 thanks Catherine. Sitting here in PJ's, my essential oil diffuser going, about to get friend to give me a massage to release toxins.

6751 2018-10-23 14:03:13 Both keynotes at #Reactive18 so far have been about *operational data* (time series, mostly) at massive scale by Tesla and Apple. Industrial applications like wind turbine farms, data centres, oil refineries and the like. Lessons for @ThoughtWire and OPM no doubt.
6752 2018-10-23 14:03:05 All ppl chose to work in whatever industry.  Oil and gas is extremely regulated. Activist put issues on ballots for ppl to vote on. Your tweet is about as biased as you are.

6757 2018-10-23 14:02:33 @SharePickers  Can I have a thumb up ? 
6758 2018-10-23 14:02:32 As I read article after newspaper article one picture is clear: he is corrupt (as I've written), both in the usual and unusual ways: Corporate PACS, lobbyist money, Wall Street money (about 1.5 million) -- wait Minnesota is not NY, tax scams, oil scams, and prescription drug 2/2
6759 2018-10-23 14:02:25 If Canada dollar and stocks drop down. Canada should think take part in Shanghai crude oil index trade. next year, take part in nature gas trade with China. Canada should  get more reasonable profits from energy industry of Canada in the world trade system.
6760 2018-10-23 14:02:25 The CIA overthrew the democratic Iranian government and installed the Shaw for cheaper oil prices, then overthrew his son when he didn't want to play along. There are dozens of examples like this, but just because the US nuked Japan they're somehow the "beacon of morality".
6761 2018-10-23 14:02:23 SK government as much as I don't like it, is done by us, SK people (except for he parts run by international oil execs).
6762 2018-10-23 14:02:23 Ahh I have no idea! It’s not even done yet! It’s I believe a 14x18 canvas and done in oil! I’ll take offers on it? Many hours being put in!
6763 2018-10-23 14:02:18 You haven’t realized that our military is used to enrich a few. It’s all about money, power, oil, and greed. Clearly you’re confused by the words “defend” and “adventurism.” Our military/CIA consume so much welfare that having a healthy populace is off the table.
6764 2018-10-23 14:02:17 Yes i put mine in like a foam cup just use a little bit tho. And put the oil in until it’s soft. And rub it in on ya lips and let it sit for two minutes and then wipe it off. And it really works . My lips were dry because the weather
6765 2018-10-23 14:02:17 Not as worried about scary oil spills as I am about Chinese spying.  Especially when it is from within government.
6766 2018-10-23 14:02:14 Got my oil change yesterday.. Then i gotta take my car to the dealership on Thursday
6767 2018-10-23 14:02:11 @maritimeissues Yes, the 60:40 law will have to amended then. But I would also argue that China might want to sell explored oil and gas (refined?) back to Ph and other neigbouring countries rather than transporting it all the way back from Palawan @GregPoling
6768 2018-10-23 14:02:08 Oh please PROVE Clinton cartel with Bush who started a war under a lie for OIL.

6770 2018-10-23 14:02:06 It's powerful stuff that snake oil.
6771 2018-10-23 14:02:06 
6772 2018-10-23 14:02:06 It's simple Bro! 
If the investigation found Saudi Arabia culpable of the murder, this may lead to sanctions from the US/international community.
Sanctions will 90% be on oil. Thus in turns increases the current Oil prices which favours Nigeria.

6814 2018-10-23 13:59:29 The fact that US Democrats aren't using this whole Saudi Arabia thing to lessen their country's dependence on Gulf oil astounds me.

6835 2018-10-23 13:57:33 Sugar , coffee and olive oil
6836 2018-10-23 13:57:30 Our dependence on their oil and our lack of morality is partially to blame for all of this
6837 2018-10-23 13:57:24 A fresh oil change, tire rotation , vacuum/wash in my car feels great 
6838 2018-10-23 13:57:13 Yes of course, I just meant if the sole reason why you’re using coconut oil over butter is the smoke point, ghee is a good solution.

6848 2018-10-23 13:56:30 The stock market is reacting to things like China not buying any oil from US. The trade war going on by Mr. Trump that disrupts trade and thus hurts the economies of all nations involved. But sure, the election, the Democrats are at fault for likely winning. Keep it up, good job!
6849 2018-10-23 13:56:29 The Saudis have accepted that their “rogue” men have killed #JamalKhashoggi. 

Apparently, the world has come to terms with it as well. 

Clearly, crude oil is much more important than human rights anywhere in the world.

6852 2018-10-23 13:56:11 country X gets little support for proposal to delay #IMO2020 fuel oil carriage ban. one 'yes' for every 4-5 'no's. looks like ban on ships carrying FO without scrubbers to go to working group, as expected. Almost as good as being adopted, meaning in place from March 1, 2020

6858 2018-10-23 13:55:40 This year, we have exported 58 000 tones of sugar to Kenya, 100 000,, RBZ has increased foreign currency allocation on cooking oil imports and the product is available in abundance on the black market. Can we say we have a shortage of these products? It doesn't add up
6859 2018-10-23 13:55:36 Before Trump with the most successful boom since the end of WW2, the economy was purposefully kept down to allow the rest of the world to prosper at our expense! Bush’s economy was better even with 9/11, oil spills, Catrina! With a repub Congress!
6860 2018-10-23 13:55:34 Just allocate two oil blocks to them,so that they won't disturb us again for money. We go die for their hand.

Do you think scots would need bailed out if we had 100% of oil and gas?
You actually believe those who take the 92% and tell you scots r skint?

6872 2018-10-23 13:54:50 Which message? That PMB is responsible for the recessions?? When PDP looted the nation's reserve, buying private jets, sharing money through Dasuki, you had no idea it would lead to a weak economy that can't defend the nation against the recession? Or PMB causes low oil prices?
6873 2018-10-23 13:54:27 No worries, it’s wildcat drilling low COS but the oil is either there or it’s water due to the size of the structure. Edison’s have COS at 9% so very low but you never know. No point buying now as it will drift lower but I have a position for the results
6874 2018-10-23 13:54:26 Stop the press. This essential oil has helped me with allergies more than all the pills and nose sprays combined. My first time ever using essentials other than lavender for relaxation. Definitely look into this.  @ Saje Natural Wellness
6875 2018-10-23 13:54:26 If it’s crappy deal they can cancel it.  What bothers me is the virtue signalling.  This gov threatens to cancel a deal but happily opposes the Western pipelines that could allow reductions of oil from dictators. The hypocrisy is extreme.

6890 2018-10-23 13:53:39 Agreed.
But that's rarely the case when discussing Wilson's hits.

6913 2018-10-23 13:51:32 Today I learned that huckster, snake oil and monorail salesman is proposing to save more than 1 billion dollars per year on something that costs 315 million. This clown is a freaking fraud. #ksgov
6914 2018-10-23 13:51:30 Justin if you really want to do something, other than being a showboat, stop buying overpriced Saudi oil, build a pipeline and use discounted Canadian oil!!

6921 2018-10-23 13:51:06 I wonder when libs will stop using oil as a scapegoat for everything.  If the US wanted the oil, we would have taken it a long time ago and the Middle East would be a complete desert.

6925 2018-10-23 13:50:42 Lavender essential oil has been a pretty big thing for a long time. Why is this news at the end of 2018?
6926 2018-10-23 13:50:42 Time & place for that when we as a country are not killing & starving millions of people. We all are responsible & hope it does push people to realise that we must have our government end crimes against humanity for the love of oil.

6949 2018-10-23 13:47:45 This is partially true. Full Spectrum CBD oil has traces of THC which can trigger positive on a drug test. CBD isolate is THC free and will not. Full spectrum works better though.

Many transactions seem small to USA interests but juniors can fetch a pretty penny so don't ignore the coming action as the market lifts off bottom in junior oil and gas. Niche plays fetch premiums. #OMV
6969 2018-10-23 13:46:39 Hey...here’s an idea. Let’s just pay the UN to manage our oil. After all, we are paying them to manage our carbon “pollution”.
6970 2018-10-23 13:46:35 If I have my little reminder sticker for an oil change is it get the oil change when I reach said miles or the date they provided? 
6971 2018-10-23 13:46:35 Sure, work internally and externally. But remember we are the cause of a large faction of emissions because we supply the oil. Supply AND demand. Asking others to do the work without changing ourselves is bunk.

7064 2018-10-23 13:39:36 I voted no. I have neighbors who work in the oil industry. It’s a lot more restrictive than many believe. It will kill oil and gas drilling in Colorado. Get the facts

7072 2018-10-23 13:39:13 Aside from being illegal, did you know that dumping noxious chemicals and things like motor oil down the drain can seriously harm the environment? These contaminants can reach groundwater sources and potentially affect a great number of people.
7073 2018-10-23 13:39:09 opened the national parks for fracking. not sure about this one but it doesn't matter. I can own the property next to the park and frac on my property.

7079 2018-10-23 13:38:38 When a country has “profit care” that benefits corporations and wealthy stockholders instead of “healthcare” that actually benefits citizens, apparently you have to “pitch” to these suckers to try to sell them the snake oil. Which is good for flacks like you. @ASlavitt @alfranken
7080 2018-10-23 13:38:37 Canada sells cheap oil to the US because we are too dumb to refine it here in our own country, creating hundreds of thousands of CANADIAN jobs!

Sugar coating the hardships to make us not feel bad about being poor? You know DNC method for 100 yrs?! DJT was never a politician that’s why it’s great! DNC losing money!

7093 2018-10-23 13:37:51 I heard evening primrose oil is good for hair growth. It makes your hair shinier and reduce hair loss. You can try if you want because I just started taking them this week so I haven’t seen results yet. If I do I’ll update you 
7094 2018-10-23 13:37:34 Petrichor - refers to the smell following a rain storm. Specifically, it's the oil released from the earth just prior to raining. #Knowledge #TuesdayThoughts #vocabulary 
7095 2018-10-23 13:37:16 United States and Russia are dividing up the middle east for their purposes. Allegedly, it is no longer oil, but banking and investments.
7096 2018-10-23 13:37:13 Harper had 10 years so you could also say , way to go Harper. This oil to tidewater is not new

7106 2018-10-23 13:36:26 I hope everyone is going to get their PVC. We can't keep sitting online and insulting each other while leaving our fate in the hands of those who'll be bribed with N1500 and groundnut oil. Because let's face it, these are the people who actually vote. Please get your PVC.

7108 2018-10-23 13:36:19 90:1 Leverage meaning you control 90 of something for risking 1 or something.
Tag Oil warrants are 1 cent. You can reserve 1 Share at $0.90 (currently $0.425/Share) until March 20, 2019. Iran sanctions are ***wild card to oil prices.
Oil re-balancing might mean this is a bottom
7109 2018-10-23 13:36:12 Reminder: 

Nearly all the 9/11 hijackers were Saudi.

Saudi Arabia has been an active threat to the US for at least seventeen years but we gotta stay friends with them  because... oil? Cash? I don't even know the corrupt reasoning anymore.

7115 2018-10-23 13:35:54 Powerful truth in your thread. All those dead dinosaurs who turned into oil that we pay the Saudis for at the gas pumps, pumps tons of bucks into their ability in to lobby, to influence thinkers, to use social media for their own propaganda messaging.
7116 2018-10-23 13:35:48 Ecuador? They are half the size of Texas, 13,000,000 residents, 20% of which live in poverty, another 12% on the verge. They are on a downward spiral because of their govt. they have an economy dependent on oil. That’s your example?
7117 2018-10-23 13:35:42 The stock market bc congress will change oh please what a excuse it’s the rising interest rates nice try Munucin you full of it !! Nothing like lying to ur base it’s.

7119 2018-10-23 13:35:38 Good luck to Kenya and it's people; and good luck with your nascent oil industry 

Ftr, Morocco has limited natural resources of significant monetary value (no oil or gas.)
7120 2018-10-23 13:35:37 Remember Harper and the CONS had 10 years and never got it done. This problem of oil to tidewaters just didn’t pop up yesterday

7123 2018-10-23 13:35:18 Two thirds of U.S. oil producers are still losing money as of the 2nd Q of 2018, even with oil over $70/barrel. We should question the ability of #shale/#fracking to produce oil and gas at affordable prices.

7132 2018-10-23 13:34:27 Yeah! Egypt doesn't want to import directly from Israel, which is nonsensical. 
Btw, today Bloomberg reports: Iraq has pushed Canada out of its 4th place in oil production (global ranking).
7133 2018-10-23 13:34:26 True our refineries would need significant upgrades to be able to handle a diet of exclusively heavy oil, but at current prices, those upgrades would pay for themselves in a year or two tops.

7153 2018-10-23 13:32:41 All true, however the Federal Government as a whole, both CPC and Lib, over the last 15ish years have failed on projects that would reduce foreign oil dependence.  The current price differential is magnifying how we are all as Canadians losing.
7154 2018-10-23 13:32:41 @jimsciutto Turkey was the pipeline for ISIS oil along with Sanctions on Iran where much of their oil flows through Turkey as well. Erdogan’s play besides ending Democracy is all about Oil Biz with Saudis key in Iranian Sanctions starting Nov 4th... basics Jim but U know that too

7157 2018-10-23 13:32:29 Russian get more from oil prices increase than they lose on sanctions. Sanctions are weak which is displayed by fact that no sanction goal was achieved, not a single meter of Ukrainial soil liberated. More than 10 thous Ukrainians killed and killing continues.

7162 2018-10-23 13:32:15 View it in the context that the Al Saud family running the country was always a temporary & flimsy arrangement predicated on the self delusion of the ruling elite/security of oil supply. The US can topple it and insert another from the long list of wannabees any time it wishes.

 It is "O" and "O" meaning ocean and oil

7185 2018-10-23 13:30:02 con man selling snake oil. It's poison.
7186 2018-10-23 13:29:58 (It's almost like we shouldn't have been so casually indifferent to structural collapses and human suffering in our own hemisphere just because there's no oil in Guatamala. You know, it's possible to factor likely creation of refugees into foreign policy decisions.)
7187 2018-10-23 13:29:56 Oil and gas money only last so long. Beto wants Texas to flourish as a leader in renewable energy - sun and wind. 2 things Texas has PLENTY of! Also, where is our economy going to be if we refuse to acknowledge and slow climate change? Half under water, that’s where.
7188 2018-10-23 13:29:51 Why cant the NDP just admit that it is not pro oil. We all know it. The change in messaging for the purposes of an election is quite transparent.
7189 2018-10-23 13:29:46 Tag Oil will present at the New Orleans Money Show Nov 1 to 4.
New investor money might flow in after show
The Iran are sanctions Nov 4 may boost 2-3% Brent Prices.
Nov 8 US mid-terms could add volatility to oil prices/usd. 
The taking private of Tag Oil type juniors is possible

7191 2018-10-23 13:29:39 I do but I find that it really doesn’t do much for my edges. I used the eco styler flaxseed + castor oil one, which is great but I feel like none work.

7211 2018-10-23 13:26:57 So answers to those two questions and an answer to who`s oil it is would be nice if you can manage it
7212 2018-10-23 13:26:51 ...who to me are most notable for destroying a country in real time (all the while depleting billions of dollars in oil reserves), standing in the wreckage they caused and still blaming a boogeyman.

7216 2018-10-23 13:26:25 Trump supporters, the president is going to give everyone a new car. If you don't have space in your garage, he will build you a new one. He is also going to give you gas money. And he or one of his representative will personally change your oil every 3,000 miles.

7228 2018-10-23 13:25:34 So whenever I turn on the heater at my work like an hour later my office just drowns in this cloud..? Of dust? Or sth? And I just noticed the heater is actually leaking some sort of oil so I've been breathing in this poisonous fume. Love this for me.
7229 2018-10-23 13:25:31 Agree completely. Unhealthy regime. When the oil runs out - see what happens

7233 2018-10-23 13:24:57 You need to know: #TagOil
YF Limited #1  Own 11.87% of Tag (as of June 18)
YF Finance Limited#2 Own approximately 15.05% (July 24,2018)
There are two YF's. Not One.

They own +26% of Tag Oil already. 

Tag has $35MM  Market Cap. Tag is probably worth $60MM in a 2018 takeout
7234 2018-10-23 13:24:57 Cannabis was only made illegal 80 years ago, in 1937. For the hundreds and thousands of years before that, there was never any crimes, no abuse, and no deaths associated with cannabis use. Big Oil, pharma, and bankers had it banned.
7235 2018-10-23 13:24:55 All the State Govts must Build & Operate their Own High Capacity Advanced Fast-Breeder Nuclear Power Plants to Generate Clean Sustainable Electricity as Coal is Not Sustainable & Coal based Power Plants cause Pollution to the Environment.. Even Oil & Gas is Not Sustainable..
7236 2018-10-23 13:24:54 Alberta - which has supported the other provinces for so long - has oil that is being sold to the US at a loss. Yes at prices waaay below market price. We have only one buyer for our oil - the US. The pipeline will open new markets (not US) for our oil.

7247 2018-10-23 13:23:41 Definitely a better alternative.

For health reasons look to getting PB in a glass jar. The xenoestrogenic chemicals in plastic are lipophilic and leech into the PB/oil, then you consume it.

I found a company that does almond butter In glass jars. Perfect to consume.

7256 2018-10-23 13:23:14 @Jeremy_Hunt and the rest of the establishment is waiting till the oil runs out and the saudis are too broke to buy our weapons. Only then should the saudis be told to stop slaughtering their neighbours and their critics.
7257 2018-10-23 13:23:13 I have a hard time thinking anyone could vote for the snake oil salesmen. And clearly the country is rooting for Beto, but it's Texas, they have oil.
7258 2018-10-23 13:23:12 @SkepticNikki Early in my church days I was at a friend's house. I was talking about fossil fuels. She said, "I don't believe that. I believe the lord knows we need oil to run things, so he puts it in the ground for us."

We have never discussed that or anything scientific since.

7261 2018-10-23 13:22:55 Sigh... Only thing disappointing is the delayed response of the Canadian dollar. Which always plays some bull crap game about how it doesn't care that $oil being down 2 to 3 percent.

7264 2018-10-23 13:22:36 Yes look at oil boom years in AB a lot of nice highways and backroads were built and maintained to supply oil. Some of those fields have been shut down but infrastructure remains to be used mostly by farmers.

7321 2018-10-23 13:17:29 It won't happen EVER if we keep pumping oil and building pipelines. We need to take action against #ClimateChange, not facilitate it.

7324 2018-10-23 13:17:18 Might I chime in here? Sir, would you say that the stock market readily responds to news, both positive and negative? I have seen it take a hit, because there is a hurricane in the gulf that could potentially hinder oil wells. The Stock market has responded well to Trump day one.

7341 2018-10-23 13:16:32 Canada can ban the importation of Saudi oil.
 
Which I am in favour of doing.

We can also apply massive tariffs to make it unfeasible. I realize that scumbags can circumvent it but we have to take a stand.

7350 2018-10-23 13:15:34 it just occurred to me that people in the north actually pronounce the “i” in oil, boil, and soil.
7351 2018-10-23 13:15:33 I detest daily wear mattifying products. Oil produced should be welcomed and controlled, radiant skin is never dry and ashy.
7352 2018-10-23 13:15:28 Given the connection to CNPC, this sounds more like a negotiation tactic on oil imports than a move to come into sanctions compliance with the US.
7353 2018-10-23 13:15:20 Middle class America, your biggest threat isn’t a herd of refugees. 

It’s a government that wants to take your health care, gave the richest 1% 1.6 trillion dollars of your money, sends your sons and daughters to die for oil, and so much more.

But hey, you get to own the libs.

7358 2018-10-23 13:14:55 HONG KONG, Aug. 16, 2018 YF Finance Limited ("YF") announced today that, on August 9, 2018, it acquired 3,555,500 common shares of TAG Oil Ltd. (TSX: TAO) through the facilities of the Toronto Stock Exchange at a price of C$0.38 per share, for total consideration of C$1,351,090
7359 2018-10-23 13:14:50 I am more "glass-half-full," especially as the secular stagnation narrative is so dominant. What's unusual in the post-GFC years is the frequency of negative shocks: (i) Euro zone crisis; (ii) US fiscal consolidation; (iii) Dollar up; and (iv) oil down. So lots of drag on growth.

7379 2018-10-23 13:12:56 I agree, this is why I support the pipeline. We must find other buyers other than United States. I believe green is in evitable. Yet I believe we are still decades away from being completely oil free.

7411 2018-10-23 13:10:11 Also need to fix mis-priced fossil fuels. Oil companies don't pay for pollution (including climate change) created by their product, so consumers see low prices at the pump and think gas is cheap, so let's buy SUVs/trucks. Add a price to carbon and consumers will demand EV.

7444 2018-10-23 13:06:53 Government bond prices ended higher today on fall in crude oil prices. Rupee's recovery against US Dollar has pacified fear of FPI outflows. Hopes of multiple rounds of open market bond purchases by the RBI supported bond prices.

7449 2018-10-23 13:06:21 #SaudiArabia signs deals worth more than $50 billion in oil, gas and infrastructure. A huge success for the 1st day of #DavosInTheDesert with 4000 participants from all over the world.
7450 2018-10-23 13:06:07 Lol, or it was actually cannabis oil!
7451 2018-10-23 13:06:05 Pamushana and Ozil are like Oil and Water. Lol
7452 2018-10-23 13:05:58 94% of their revenue again is from other sources not oil
7453 2018-10-23 13:05:57 Orange oil.
7454 2018-10-23 13:05:55 おかえもん！
7455 2018-10-23 13:05:41 Crude oil continues to slide from expected intra-year model peak 3 wks ago. Ethanol is worth $1.20, but behavioral economics suggest seller may find enough storage to refuse. Sellers make bottoms, not buyers. #energy
7456 2018-10-23 13:05:38 Under that logic, one is left wondering why we would ever produce our own oil at the costs it takes to produce it when we could just print USDs at nearly zero cost and give them to any OPEC nation to produce all the oil we would need

7458 2018-10-23 13:05:22 C'mon, what's a bot gotta do to get an oil fix around here?
7459 2018-10-23 13:05:20 TIL until the invention of the automobile helped create a use for it, oil refineries in Cleveland used to dump gasoline (petrol) into the waterways under cover of night. Steamboats could shovel hot coals overboard and set waterways on fire.
7460 2018-10-23 13:05:16 My bf love to rub coconut oil on my stomach lol he make sure he do it every night
7461 2018-10-23 13:05:13 negative consequences of another fall in oil?  sure -- aren't starting from as high a base.  but there was been a recovery in oil investment, so some new room too fall

7464 2018-10-23 13:05:06 I am organising the Knowledge Capsule Seminar (season 4) on matters relating to current geopolitical situation (oil/dollar etc) The talk will be followed by refreshments (courtesy Ruia Caterers). 
Venue: Sapphire Banquets 
Hope to see you..Watch space for further updates.
7465 2018-10-23 13:05:00 Our lovely Lucy P put forward Little Roo Neonatal Fund for her company’s charity donation and they’ve kindly contributed a whopping £2400. Thanks so much Lucy and Thames Oil Port  — feeling blessed
7466 2018-10-23 13:04:53 Thank you for that tidbit of information. It always baffled me why our Governments would support imported oil. Now it all makes sense. Trucks = Votes.
7467 2018-10-23 13:04:47 I agree with the first part, Canadian oil. But the last was ignorant I’m from Saskatchewan, there’s no need to talk like that
7468 2018-10-23 13:04:41 On tap for today: helicopter maintenance and doctor’s appointment. 

Maybe I’ll take the helicopter down to Blustery’s in Vantage for a burger to warm up the oil for that oil change. Anyone want to come?
7469 2018-10-23 13:04:39 Yes but it was easy to f#$k up the pipeline deal and sell alberta oil at $50 below market price to the US .....mr. Dressup and his cast  should not be doing trade deals they are way out of their league....
7470 2018-10-23 13:04:39 Was Nigeria better off under white rule? Why are things the way they are It is estimated that since 1960, Nigeria has earned $600 billion from sale of crude oil, out of which at least $400 billion were looted by our new colonialists. Some say the looted figure is higher.
7471 2018-10-23 13:04:20 い、韻ノートパイセン…！
7472 2018-10-23 13:04:18 It really annoys me when people say that Venezuela is in the situation it is in now because of socialism and nothing else. They never seem to take into account that in 2014 there was a collapse in the Oil trade, Venezuelas main export and the government didn't prepare for this
7473 2018-10-23 13:04:12 We're pro-frying oil. Anti-splatter.
7474 2018-10-23 13:04:05 Chevron top pick as Piper Jaffray assumes integrated oil coverage
7475 2018-10-23 13:04:01 yeah it did hurt but i already put shit tons of coconut oil and it's getting better now
7476 2018-10-23 13:03:59 Last I checked, isn't 18 the legal age of voting? So Joe, it does matter how young you are.
7477 2018-10-23 13:03:57 NOTICE that @SenTedCruz has no mud on his fancy li'l Texas boots; must have thown it all at his opponent, after #LiarInChief @realDonaldTrump threw it back at HIM. Seems there's more mud than oil in Texas right now. #BetoVote #6November2018 to save America, liberty, peace.
7478 2018-10-23 13:03:53 For moving oil, I’m pretty sure a pipeline is more cost effective than twinning a rail line. Especially when one has been started already.
7479 2018-10-23 13:03:49 did you eat that healthy peanut butter? with the natural oil sitting on top? that turned me off from regular ass peanut butter for awhile
7480 2018-10-23 13:03:49 Russia does not buy Saudi oil. it is the western world supplies headchoppers with money
7481 2018-10-23 13:03:43 Dr Olander is good here but obviously old. Lol but try to be consistent with your oil massages for about a month and see how it works out for you. Also weekly deep/hot oil treatments.
7482 2018-10-23 13:03:34 Castor oil and hemp oil. Both were really good, my hair is growing longer and thicker than ever.
7483 2018-10-23 13:03:30 No, they're the same treats he always has. He gets one a day at night after he finishes his business.  I should probably get some CBD oil or get him weed treats so he can go to sleep lol.  That's a good idea.
7484 2018-10-23 13:03:18 No butter. Just oil yaar
7485 2018-10-23 13:03:18 How does an oil change and tire rotation take an hour
7486 2018-10-23 13:03:17 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
7487 2018-10-23 13:03:14 It might cos of the palm oil some use for it sha.
7488 2018-10-23 13:03:10 Well I need to know who paid for it how long ... sorry when reading papers you must take be dispassionate and not read into what you want to believe... I would try  mmj oil if I had cancer bc I have nothing to lose...but solid science before you tell ppl it cures!
7489 2018-10-23 13:03:06 Who would have thought a totalitarian dictatorship with zero respect for human rights could use murder and  extreme brutality to suppress mild criticism and peaceful dissent?  We don't need their oil at the cost of our souls.
7490 2018-10-23 13:03:04 FYI, The U.S. is the largest EXPORTER of petroleum in the world. Trumptanic could just decree that ALL oil drilled in the U.S. would stay in the U.S. because of national security concerns.
7491 2018-10-23 13:02:53 You dinno add oil to your platter?
7492 2018-10-23 13:02:29 Ah, but nowt for the oil companies to flog us.
7493 2018-10-23 13:02:27 Crushed rosemary and garlic roast potatoes in olive oil are the best.
7494 2018-10-23 13:02:23 Flood the market and dry up Saudi oil revenue at we could see a radical Islamic revolution similar to Iran. Saudi royal family and Wahabbists are the frog and the scorpion.

7507 2018-10-23 13:01:08 It’s straight propaganda. That’s who oil companies are worried about
7508 2018-10-23 13:01:03 Abandon your oil rigs and return to your stations!
7509 2018-10-23 13:00:55 Problem is Obama had the same message, Hillary did too. Trump won because of Russian involvement brainwashing these desperate people. Trump is a snake oil salesmen.

7534 2018-10-23 12:59:25 I question their integrity because they publish talking points straight from the oil and gas industry. I accused their readership of being old, not them.
7535 2018-10-23 12:59:17 Oh if we were only an oil rich country ourselves, what a difference it would make...oh wait....yet this dipshit can't get a single pipeline built so we can stop importing Saudi oil?
7536 2018-10-23 12:59:07 Um, but you know that CBD oil is already legal?

Not sure what you think is on the ballot.
7537 2018-10-23 12:59:07 I can’t believe ppl still use lotion to moisturize they’re body. Thought y’all knew you were suppose to use body oil following a body butter.
7538 2018-10-23 12:59:07 More likely he is worried about Saudi cutting us of from their oil.
7539 2018-10-23 12:59:02 If I'm really craving biscuits and haven't made anything myself, I've started going to @IcelandFoods: their own-brand "mini bites" contain no palm oil at all unlike in @sainsburys...
7540 2018-10-23 12:58:56 I'm a user for medicinal purposes only. I've only been provided once & that was two years ago & used twice only & that was to vape not smoke with tobacco! I suffer with 24/7 chronic pain. I also vape CBD oil on a daily basis. The cannabis is used only for my extreme circumstances

7565 2018-10-23 12:57:17 Are you telling me that a cooking oil company has Twitter
7566 2018-10-23 12:57:01 Most Canadians have private health insurance on top of government system. Is just as "free".  Norway pays for healthcare system with global  warming exports (oil). No one wants to live in those countries. Immigration there doesn't exist.

Strange in ww1 and ww2 more than 5 millions muslims moatly were Arabs under the crown of England!!! Palestine was occupied by 1 million Egyptian soldiers in the British army!! Search history, you'll find out oil wasn't only thing...
7577 2018-10-23 12:56:07 Olive oil soap > everything else
7578 2018-10-23 12:56:07 ..but we sure like Saudi oil.   Like an addiction, we can't stop buying it regardless of what they do over there.   We have no alternative.
7579 2018-10-23 12:56:06 The oil issue is self-inflicted. We can produce oil cheaply enough in our own oilfields that we don't have to rely on the Saudis or Iranians or Syrians or Russians...or Norwegians. We could flood global markets with US-based crude & force better behavior through the markets 2/2.

7585 2018-10-23 12:55:10 A good Chris Packham doc. (repeated recently) - Looking For The Lost Girl (in Sumatra). The replacement of natural habitats  with hectares of palm trees for palm oil is equally destructive. We’ve got perhaps a decade to save the whole eco-system and Trump wants “nukes”!
7586 2018-10-23 12:55:05 ていかーさんてらありですー

7638 2018-10-23 12:50:12 Such a silly argument. It appears to be about who's oil we stop consuming. It doesn't matter now. The best scientists in the world say we're all fucked unless we stop burning stuff to make energy. Why not talk about that, instead of all the money we didn't make by burning it all?

7640 2018-10-23 12:50:09 i am terribly confused.Not so many ships, but the pollution is very high due to the kind of oil they are burning. Until now they are freed from clean air rules, but they also must do their piece at last. And no nuclear things, much to dangerous.

7727 2018-10-23 12:44:19 4) Trump has heard (NOT READ) some of the tactics that Reagan used in order to weaken USSR. He is copying & pasting them without any other consideration. For example dragging USSR to costly space program (Space Force), arms race, keeping the price of oil & gas low, etc etc.

7732 2018-10-23 12:43:58 In the material world, oil is topical. It is poured on a person. In the spiritual world, the anointing is on and in a person. As John puts it, “The anointing you have, lives in you” (1 John 2:27). What an idea! Oil or lotion will rub off. That which is inside is long-lasting.

Some of their men treated western women like dirt, myself included, whilst a secretary. I stood up to them.

7754 2018-10-23 12:41:45 Yeah, not believing in climate change really only proves my point. All the data shows backs up that theory, your belief isn't supported by fact. Even the oil companies disagree with you.
7755 2018-10-23 12:41:39 I came across lots of information regarding misuse of "Temple Hundi" funds etc. My personal take is never donate money to temple. Get garland / lamp oil / fruits etc. as offerings instead.

7784 2018-10-23 12:39:13 Where do you get your info?  Methane emissions from U.S oil & gas are <1.5% of global methane emissions & "fracking" (i.e stimulating the well under pressure) is a tiny part of that. Enteric fermentation is the big culprit.  Also, GWP100 is 27X & CH4 is gone from air in ~12yrs

7788 2018-10-23 12:38:48 Most vegans would not consider palm oil “vegan” as it has destroyed the habitat of the orangutan. This destruction has been caused by the food giants who are hand in glove with the meat lobby.
7789 2018-10-23 12:38:46 2) Advantage from this. He wants to keep the price of oil & gas low to put pressure on Iran & Russia; China would take advantage. he wants to increase the cost for China by increasing the price of oil & gas; Russia and Iran take advantage. Complete confusion & chaos.

7836 2018-10-23 12:33:57 There are NO "high" concerns. It's all topical. It's an oil or a cream. I've seen it and researched it. It's a lack of education thing. Which is why I appreciate the coverage and encouraged by the 61% MU poll stat.

Which releases methane when harvested, or eaten by cattle. Which along with the CO2 from our use of coal, gas, and oil causes more heat to be held by the planet.

7889 2018-10-23 12:29:16 Trump sounds like a 'snake oil salesman' at these rallies. People would gather around the mans podium to listen to what the best 'medicine in a bottle'  money could buy. What the man selling was colored water and diluted poison. Trump the 'snake oil salesman'!

7893 2018-10-23 12:29:04 US stock futures are off 1.5% with both Asia and Europe lower.  Oil is $68.06 with gold at $1,241. The markets seem to  have an upset stomach today. It is hard to digest a trade war and the impact of tariffs on earnings.

7898 2018-10-23 12:28:29 How about a traybake? Whack some chicken, carrots, peppers, garlic and onion on a baking tray, drizzle with oil, salt, pepper, and paprika then let it cook and serve with couscous or salad xx
7899 2018-10-23 12:28:17 Tapping the oil in America was suppose to make us energy independent. It was suppose to stop our reliance on the middle east. Why do we export our oil?  Why do we pipe in shale oil from Canada?
7900 2018-10-23 12:28:08 Just yesterday Merkel announced they were funding a natural gas pipeline because of pressure from Trump. That undercuts Russian oil sales into Germany, and hurts Putin, helping the US.

7926 2018-10-23 12:25:35 Or how about this: DON’T bring oil out of the ground. Drilling damages the environment; burning oil damages the ecosystem. Use renewables instead—unless you’re so selfish & greedy that short-term profit outweighs the lives of your grandchildren.

8253 2018-10-23 11:49:13 @samcunningham could be because, like 60% of the brazilians we are against politicians from left wing that promote the worst corruption case in the world! US$ 12 billion only at oil company.
8254 2018-10-23 11:48:56 We’re on the same page with regards to consuming our own oil. But to make this a Saudi related issue I believe is a stretch.  And of course they can purchase poorly made trucks from countries like Russia, China or India.  Finished goods versus commodities, there’s a difference

On purpose. We can’t just change that over night. So your point is moot. We do import, a lot, from Saudi Arabia.

8286 2018-10-23 11:43:57 2. Standard Oil was a monopoly. Monopolies are not good. They’re anti democratic. They crush innovative competition. Too big of a company eventually means “too big to fail”

Are you suggesting it`s not Scotland`s oil Darren?
8390 2018-10-23 11:33:39 Hello, #PalmOil may have a bad reputation but it's not all grown the same. There are many companies producing palm oil in a socially and environmentally responsible way as members of the RSPO. 1/2

8411 2018-10-23 11:31:30 WM has taken 92% of scots oil for 50 years and still near bankrupt.
Do you think scots would be better off with 100% of oil or the 8% we get now?
Do you think scots are wrong to want to run their own country?
Did you know about the 92% Darren?

8671 2018-10-23 11:02:29 I made my first visit of the season to the olive mill this morning. Everywhere was clean and tidy with not so many farmers there yet. The mill's first pressing was yesterday. Our first load, this morning. I cannot wait to taste that young organic oil.
8672 2018-10-23 11:02:24 Impressed with the cleanliness of the waiting area and office. The owner and mechanic were very friendly. I'll be coming back for oil changes and anything else needed for my car.
8673 2018-10-23 11:02:13 Stop with the feelings - renewables already much cheaper. That’s economics. 
You know coal oil and gas giants get more than $4B in subsidies a year? Much more than renewables.

8676 2018-10-23 11:01:54 In my opinion CBD oil from the #hemp plant is not the same as it is from the #marijuana. I know a little girl who was using hemp version nothing. She got Charlottes Web and seizures stopped. So CBD oil didn’t work from the hemp strain. Marijuana is the medicine.

8833 2018-10-23 10:42:41 Really,,I take it you know Westminster has taken 92% of scots oil for 50 years.
So indy scots would have 100% of oil revenues instead of 8%,,,that is a huge bonus.self gov is normal.
Brexit is stupid and everyone knows it is a bad move.
The two are nothing like the same.

8944 2018-10-23 10:26:14 Despite tensions around the Khashoggi case, Saudi Arabia plans to sign deals worth more than $50B in the oil, gas, industries and infrastructure sectors.The deals will be signed with companies including, Total $TOT, Schlumberger $SLB, Halliburton $HAL and Baker Hughes $BHGE.
8945 2018-10-23 10:25:53 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.

8947 2018-10-23 10:25:03 Has the Court specified when you should bathe on deepawali, how much oil per person, what colour clothes are permitted and meal timings?

9078 2018-10-23 10:09:00 Yes, there must be restrictions. All drains get clogged with oil and assorted powders used while taking oil bath, restricting movement of water.
So, taking oil bath must be banned.  #SupremeCourt #FireCrackerBan

9084 2018-10-23 10:07:57 We should thank Turkish President Recep T. Erdogan for his courage to stand up against Saudi Arabia's leaders after they sent killers who killed journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
Not many people have courage to stand in the way of these leaders who literally swim in dollars and oil.
9085 2018-10-23 10:07:18 VCs -some- may not be clueless. I recall within "Margin Call(2011)", Hedge Fund Managers were invited to be 1) Smart,2) first, or 3) criminal, to survive. Tulip Bulb Mania will always entice those susceptible to Snake Oil Salesmen.

9104 2018-10-23 10:03:02 Flaxseed oil contains mucilage, a type of fiber that can slow digestion. This allows the glucose to be digested &  released into the blood more slowly &  prevents sudden spikes in blood sugar levels. Therefore may help in decreasing  incidence of insulin resistance in diabetics.

9344 2018-10-23 09:30:00 Clean skin is beautiful skin. It's important to keep your skin cleansed of sweat, dirt, and oil to prevent clogged pores and a dull appearance.

9345 2018-10-23 09:29:55 This is some first class deflection. With ISIS a non-threat, we can go back to letting Turkey slaughter kurds and we can pretend their NATO and oil producing status gives us at least some leverage against Saudi Arabia.
Don't forget #Erdogan is infamous for abducting journalists.

9347 2018-10-23 09:29:52 And that is the very reason the US is trying so hard to bring Venezuela to its knees , so they can step in and steal their oil reserves.

9378 2018-10-23 09:24:35 I don't think the world leaders would have bowed to the ruler of Saudi Arabia if he didn't have oil to the degree that Saudis do. I think they and other producing states, almost all of whom, except Norway & Canada are dictatorships, have thrown their weight around because of oil.

9380 2018-10-23 09:24:17 Just to show you how much deep this conspiracy is, there’s no measures put on place over the years to avoid continually losing oil through spillage in order to stop claiming insurance every year.

Instead this loophole has been left to continually defraud KPC. #KPCBillionOilScam

9656 2018-10-23 08:43:46 Best advice natural foods...eggs and fruit for breakfast, vegetables and meat in moderation, wine with every family dinner, big Sunday brunches and olive oil should be essential to the food pyramid.

9658 2018-10-23 08:43:24 God won't put more on you than you can bear.  The olive has to be pressed for the oil to flow.  He wants to be your burden bearer. Give him all your hurt and pain (Matt 11: 28-30).  I'm praying for you guys and wish you the best in you every endeavor.  Be blessed.
9659 2018-10-23 08:43:24 Leather still looks good, I’d wash them with a bit of white vinegar to get the dirt out and  then give them one or many layers of mink oil. You’ll trade the mate finish for a more cowboyi (love that new word) brown but you’ll gain some waterproofing
9660 2018-10-23 08:43:08 Rationality went out when we decided that variable intermittent generation is the path to decarbonising energy, and throwing tens of billions of other people's money at it would make it work.

9739 2018-10-23 08:30:15 That's exactly what this is. Control & price fixing of oil. Trump is helping Russia & Saudis squeeze everyone else out. Why else did he kill renewables/Open the arctic to drilling for Russia/Rosneft/Environment be damned.

9744 2018-10-23 08:29:36 Yup. Plus my team leader only changes the oil weekly once *oopsie, I said it*. It's damn nauseating in an air-conditioned environment.
9745 2018-10-23 08:29:28 Do u mean iran uses azerbijan for the oil sellings .I do not think so azerbijan is a good friend for Israel they wont do that
9746 2018-10-23 08:29:26 how about we just let the arms guys deal with the dead children; the oil guys deal with the atmosphere - back next week - golf - get it on fox news - then we can call our orthopedic research brand 'kneegrow' and no one will stand in our way (due to knee pain (and oppression))
9747 2018-10-23 08:29:08 For where? Don't mind those people,  if Lagos has oil and gas, why didn't they use it to sustain their economy when Niger delta Avengers where destroying pipelines? Instead Nigeria collapsed.
9748 2018-10-23 08:29:08 Euro 6. I change oil every 7,500 miles although the service book says every 15,000 miles.
Is your cab a Euro 5 Anna? If so, every 6,000 miles is a good idea.

Not that he was deceived, or that some duped him, NO! He planned it that way with his men. You see!
9751 2018-10-23 08:28:24 Yeah Sherlock, pls don't tell them about flying helicopters at the rate of 55/km PKR. Them Saudis know oil better than anyone else. And definitely hush about smart move of selling cows and old shitty cars. Please!

9762 2018-10-23 08:25:48 As much as this seems a good idea, Saudis just need reduce oil production by 4bn barrels / day to force a recession

9775 2018-10-23 08:23:13 Supplycor one of the KPC’s OMCs placed a loss of Sh1B to oil spillage and vandalism. This was acknowledged by the company’s MD Joe Sang who then took step to forward the bills to CIC Insurance Company.  #KPCBillionOilScam
9776 2018-10-23 08:23:10 There’s deliberate scam by the OMCs To Steal Oil then place false claims of loss to get compensation from the insurance. It also doesn’t make sense as to why KPC should be covering the insurance and not the companies.

9788 2018-10-23 08:21:49 Oil (and other prehistoric hydrocarbons) have enabled us to get this far in the last ~200 years and will continue to do so for another 100-200. If we value our (children's) lives then other forms of energy will be necessary, particularly solar thermal and PV.
9789 2018-10-23 08:21:39 We also bought each other lots of beer which probably helped oil the relationship.

9792 2018-10-23 08:20:56 Sanction Saudi Arabia's Oil ASAP! At $400 a barrel the US would make a killing selling our oil now that we are both the world's #1 exporter of oil and the #1 refinery for oil. The trllions we'll make will dwarf that measly little weapons deal with the Saudis.

9809 2018-10-23 08:18:41 I don't think the world leaders would have bowed to the ruler of Saudi Arabia if he didn't have oil to the degree that Saudis do. I think they and other producing states, almost all of whom, except Norway & Canada are dictatorships, have thrown their weight around because of oil.

9862 2018-10-23 08:11:29 Well, if WTI has any ideas of slowing the descent, the current range is as likely a place as anywhere IMO.....61.8% from highs and tiptoeing around $70.....just a reminder, I hate Oil and rarely trade it as I usually get it utterly wrong, just some thoughts popping out
9863 2018-10-23 08:11:16 China is not interested in Canadian bitumen. Hard to process. Lots of Iranian oil much ise higher quality.

9865 2018-10-23 08:10:58 See, if you tweet with #CongressGayiTelLene, then some congress members will go to bring oil and as per their mindset, they will do scam there too. 

Therefore it is request to everyone to not tweet with #CongressGayiTelLene
9866 2018-10-23 08:10:55 Oil price gradually coming down and Rand doing better against the dollar. Should mean petrol price will ease in long run. Please stop shouting at Cyril.

9873 2018-10-23 08:10:28 @citizentommy As a staunch indy supporter and environmentalist, I'm conflicted: I'd rather Scotland became the first oil rich nation that chose to leave it in the ground. Is that possible, within current economic reality?

9881 2018-10-23 08:09:52 The roots of each recession are unique The 2007/2008 started with the housing bubble. The 1990/1991 was fuelled by the breaking of the startup bubble. The 1973/1975 by the great increase in oil prices etc. etc. So concentrating on the housing bubble limits what ignites recessions

9920 2018-10-23 08:05:13 Yeah, I think milk and eggs are straightforward enough to see as animal byproducts but once it gets into the whole "Pollinated by animals." or "It still hurts animals." area it gets hard. Like palm oil doesn't come from animals but its extraction hurts habitats.

Bin Salman is going to liberate Saudi Arabia into global trade and integration. The oil prices will go down.
