9 2018-06-10 23:57:53 The Chinese consider 6 to be lucky. The equivalent of what the western world would perceive the number 7 to be. I buy 2 Body Armor drinks & a protein bar at my local store always comes to $6.66 & the cashier begs me to "Please buy something else"  Now she wont ring me up  
10 2018-06-10 23:57:47 There is no limit to the number of crypto currencies that can be created. Actually, it is the first medium of exchange in human history to have unlimited supply. Just think about it.

17 2018-06-10 23:56:20 The whales weren’t finished. Why so many sellers? Where are the new buyers? 
It seems likes the world is PREPPING for crypto,  as some well known companies are gearing for a crypto rollout. 
In doing so, I think they are focused on the tech, and not necessarily the popularity.

28 2018-06-08 23:57:44 People are obsessed with buying in-game items in China. It's a crazy big market. Also, with more automation and universal basic income,  global tread will skew towards e-sports, I think we will see a crazy growth in that sector, only second to crypto.

Ethereum is what got me into crypto.
32 2018-06-08 23:57:12 Are Crypto currency forks an example of publishing a fork?
33 2018-06-08 23:56:51 Security Tokens already fit within regulations. Regulators aren't going to change the laws just because #crypto #ICOs stamp "not a security" on their docs.

Follow the law. Give investors equity - they deserve it for funding your business. It doesn't have to be complicated
