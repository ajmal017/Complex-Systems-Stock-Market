It was big news, but it had virtually no impact on the income or wealth of most American families. The reason? They own little or no stock. A whopping 84 percent of all stocks owned by Americans belong to the wealthiest 10 percent of households.

48 2018-02-11 23:31:27 Good analysis--I looked at annualized 10-year compound real returns for stocks with data going back to 1926. The minimum was -4.62% ('65 - '74) and the max was 18.09% ('49 - '58). 25th to 75th percentiles = 3.06% to 11.16%. Ten years seems not enough to fully tame volatility.

55 2018-02-11 23:23:31 We did not have inflation (as defined by Keynesian economists) before 2008, even with housing and subprime mortgages wrecking the economy. Now its stocks and bonds that are hyper inflated. Still, this is not part of the official measurement. Same old, same old

I tend to look at post placing stocks with near term news catalyst, buy low, let the placing stock churn (3/4 times the placing share volume) and then ride the spike.

Much easier said than done

133 2018-02-11 22:10:50 @thehonestcroock hi I just finished watching your pre-flight video... it’s great very informative... however my concern is that none of the stocks you had on your watchlist you actually liked... so I still don’t know what stocks you like or look forward to buy. Any more info?

135 2018-02-11 22:10:00 The Dow has fallen for 2 weeks in a row, dropping 2426 points (-9.1%), making this the biggest 2 week fall seen in the 340 weeks since 5 August 2011. The sequence of weekly losses last extended to 3 weeks on 13 May 2016, 92 weeks ago (when the run lasted for 4 weeks) #stocks
136 2018-02-11 22:08:03 There will never be a US govt bond "crisis."  However Fed will likely be forced into BOJ yield curve control far sooner than most think as Falling stocks = falling tax revs = rising UST issuance = ylds up = W/R/R
137 2018-02-11 22:07:57 Woah so I looked at @exxonmobil #XOM - buy the dip. Looks good. Then I saw the debt. 900% of EV. Maybe not. #NYSE #StockMarket #stocks

141 2018-02-11 22:04:48 who has the stocks know this news is fake news from lousy journalist.
142 2018-02-11 22:03:11 Look at a chart of the Dow you idiot.   You will see the economy has been steady for almost 9 years.   This is the first major downturn.   Admittedly it has been a great year for stocks so a pullback was expected.
143 2018-02-11 22:03:03 For real though, to my understanding trading stocks is just exchanging pictures of various amounts of money without any cash actually changing hands.
144 2018-02-11 22:02:24 Have you banned Bump Stocks on guns yet? That would help keep the POLICE & CIVILIANS safe.

160 2018-02-11 21:50:25 So my 2 cents on markets. While we pulled back from the ridiculous overbought level exacerbated by the short vol extreme one sided trade and the subsequent unwind of that extreme, risk is still being repriced and the "volatility of volatility" is a dangerous thing for stocks++

167 2018-02-11 21:44:15 that sentiment is reflected by all the folks I spoke to. The only question is whether it will be a straight V or a W type bounce. No one thinks that stocks can go lower anymore and that the bottom is in.

180 2018-02-11 21:33:42 @Marina_Sirtis Fed's policy of cheap money and artificially low interest rates have vastly inflated the value of such stocks. The slightest correction of interest rates will send all such values crashing down.
181 2018-02-11 21:33:38 Holy shit, this is a marketing decision about as well informed as someone thinking to cut their dick in half will give them two dicks.

198 2018-02-11 21:21:28 It rose 30% since his election and recently dropped 10% . Although a president has little influence on the stock markets, there is no reason for anyone to acknowledge a poor performance of stocks. I’ll happily take the 20% gains over the last 14 months.

214 2018-02-11 21:12:02 Essential that stocks be diversified globally and across small/value companies though. Large cap stocks that dominate basic index funds are not sufficiently diversified (MSCI Japan Index = 0% from 1989-2016, S&P 500 = 0% from 2000-2011)

220 2018-02-11 21:09:49 Skip annuities & hold a diversified portfolio of stocks/bonds, something like 60/40 w/bonds 100% short-term.  Bonds will equal about a decade of income not in stocks and can be sold in bear markets to live on. Spend stocks in bull markets.  Much easier and more successful...

225 2018-02-11 21:05:58 Another MAGA fairytale. The deficit is going through the roof, but I’ve heard that you love debt. Stocks are in a frenzy, and they’re predicting a rise in interest rates.

It's really predictable

256 2018-02-11 20:37:55 Problem with gold stocks is their market cap incorporates so much speculative prospecting value (like biotech clinical trials). So when market de-risks, they get hacked. Don’t believe me?  Current action proves it. They are not cheap on eps or fcf basis.
257 2018-02-11 20:37:46 So what are you going to do about it?  What changes to gun laws?  Background checks?  Bump stocks?  Anything?

Nope - Just a big van full of thoughts and prayers, huh?
258 2018-02-11 20:35:40 I don’t get how changing to FCC’s will help. If you have boats who have virtually no FQA’s but Good % split of Main stocks. They’re going to be landing a lot more and using up the national quota pot a lot quicker. Unless quotas are given huge increases or EU has their taken away?

267 2018-02-11 20:27:12 TRUTH: 13% of Americans got a small raise or a one-time bonus. 87% did not. Corporations are using the rest of their tax windfall to buy back their own stocks & make themselves & their stockholders richer.
268 2018-02-11 20:23:47 Just curious, what are your better uses for cash now, than buying oversold stocks, that didn’t exist in ‘08-‘09?
269 2018-02-11 20:23:40 Not to mention like all stocks are owned by like 90% of the wealthiest ms families in America

How are the tax breaks going there? How come you keep cheering for the 2% of the break going to regular people but stay quiet about the 98% being used by corporations to buy back stocks? Where are you're tax returns?

277 2018-02-11 20:17:57 OH my who knew spending all that money this week was such a dumb idea. The stock market just crashed and if only i put money into some stocks i could have really used that money i could have gained right about now. [EVENTS]
278 2018-02-11 20:16:49 I know. But w/o comparisons, we don't know how much. My guess is at least a couple of those are no worse. The rich have always owned most stocks, Corp tax cuts go to SH by definition (but many Co's raised wages/bonuses), & trade/debt have been awful for decades.
279 2018-02-11 20:15:52 Forget Daily chart.. Stick with monthly  & weekly chart for stocks...
280 2018-02-11 20:15:51 Trump policies: corp tax cut, deregulation, repatriation of capital, getting rid of obamacare mandate, and infrastructure spending all help stock returns. not nearly as beneficial for REITS.  anticipate Stocks will outperform REITS by a wide margin with rising interest rates now

282 2018-02-11 20:14:43 Kind of like the stock market after your tax plan... stocks take two major losses after your foolish plan backfires and allows them to do stock buybacks. Idiot-in-chief
283 2018-02-11 20:13:32 It doesn't matter if you smoke or not, Sessions cracking down on marijuana will effect the stocks. Trump sold you a bill of goods. The fact is Trump doesn't know wtf he is doing & he is going to destroy the economy & our democracy. Hopefully you wake up before the next election?
284 2018-02-11 20:13:29 After a few years of data we'd have an accurate picture on stocks and because we are seeing what mother nature's doing we can react to rather than impose on it with arbitrary quotas based on 
 guesstimates that either cause discards or chokes
285 2018-02-11 20:11:39 Now because catching the 'wrong' fish has brought you no benefit (you've ended up the same) science knows because there's 'time for the crime' that fish wasn't caught belligerently but because of abundance. This can be factored ina so accurate representation of stocks.
286 2018-02-11 20:10:24 yeah I realized that my comment seemed kind of hostile towards you. It was actually directed to the people who hate on people who use stocks and packs and shit like that. What I was trying to say was people shouldnt give a shit if u use packs, stocks, etc. my b
287 2018-02-11 20:09:34 Naw ya melt ur no listening. I'm no saying it again after this. Last season he played a regular shift on the 3rd line as we went with 8F, 5D and a NM as our imports. Stocks was out almost all season and we cut Turon. So he played 3rd line regular but no PP or SH shifts. 
288 2018-02-11 20:09:22 That doesn't figure in that corporations used to have pensions, insurance for you and your family, stocks, all that stuff that basically nobody does anymore. And they're making more $ than ever and paying less into taxes.

Let me correct my opinion.
I dislike watching Bayo at the top level EXCEPT for Salem. 
Salem’s neutral, fundamentals, and combos are all solid. He’s the kind of lame play you’d be fine watching cuz he’s not taking stocks at 0.

391 2018-02-11 19:11:22 I just wanted to share this really quick. If you’re picking your own common stocks (as the great Ben Graham advised) pull 5 years of financial reports and start from the back while doing your analysis. it works! You’ll catch accounting issues faster!
392 2018-02-11 19:10:59 Wouldnt risk aversion normally be a migration to bonds?

Going from stocks to Bitcoin sounds like a bad idea.

399 2018-02-11 19:07:29 You're right there was some misinformation here its was actually 13 STOCKS FUCK YES
400 2018-02-11 19:07:26 I don’t gamble in the stock market. I don’t like paper assets. Stocks, bonds, and mutual funds are all the same type of asset class. I personally like real estate for monthly Cashflow. Stocks can’t provide that, unless they have a dividend. Even then, it’s a very low return.
401 2018-02-11 19:05:09 Why are you punishing people who don't want to use your crap update? In all reality the only one who is gonna suffer at the end of the day is your company's stocks
402 2018-02-11 19:04:42 It's been pumped up with worthless fiat from the Fed. Rates are rising, stocks are crashing. I thought you were the one with a PhD? HAHA

412 2018-02-11 18:57:46 Indeed, indeed. I still wonder whether Trump expected that stocks would crash early enough so Obama'd get the blame.

421 2018-02-11 18:50:07 True, but real currencies, stocks etc measure (at least to a certain extent) performance of real countries, companies etc. Experts can often forecast trends. 

Crypto otoh is essentially pure gambling. :)

423 2018-02-11 18:47:20 Good question. Increasingly there are ESG index funds available, which typically screen stocks and weed out the “sinners”. Also worth looking at #FTSE4Good and firms like @ethexuk

426 2018-02-11 18:45:39 Well I'd have said bring back the stocks so that they could be publicly shamed and we could all throw rotten fruit at them but I don't think that's allowed so reporting them to everyone that matters seemed the next best option 
427 2018-02-11 18:44:54 Unless they knew and shorted stocks to make up the difference.  You can make money either way in the stock market if you know it's coming.
428 2018-02-11 18:44:26 Crop at 100mmt not such an issue but problem is they are assuming crop around 92mmt and hence eliminating a big chunk of stocks. This would see substantial imports and likely change dynamics a lot. Hard to see the Indian crop from here but happy to hear feedback from locals.

458 2018-02-11 18:14:31 #stocks  When investing for total return from your portfolio,  don't over diversify. You could be earning simple bank interest or less if one-third of your portfolio is booming, but one-third of it is stagnant, and the other one-third is declining.

461 2018-02-11 18:13:03 Reality agrees with me, naturally.

Anyone who is correctly aware of Israel's nuclear weapon stocks, and its $3+ billion free war toys from the U.S. every year is well aware that it's the local bully.

That and the number of time it's attacked its neighbours!

506 2018-02-11 17:54:32 Agree but OTOH value investing doesn't have a precise definition. Buffett himself started buying super cheap stocks (cigar butts) & sought more quality businesses at reasonable prices after meeting Munger. Two very different styles within one large category.
507 2018-02-11 17:53:39 Good points, but too many of these articles frame stocks as something only "rich" people buy (and are thus "bad"), rather than address the lack of financial education in the middle class.

Who's trading stocks and what's the best app out there for doing so?
663 2018-02-11 16:29:49 Your circumstances do not dictate your blessings.
664 2018-02-11 16:29:14 IF/WHEN spx confirms stick with stocks with relative strength imho... to me that means stocks where the 50sma is above the 200 sma
665 2018-02-11 16:27:49 I love that fact that 99% of the news media doesn't cover how high the stocks have gone and how wonderful the economy is been but the minute there's a slight AKA a correction in the stock market the news media is all over it
666 2018-02-11 16:27:33 I am buying in Monday on "some" stocks at their 200 day.  I either get a bounce or a small loss on each stock.  Or, the hated gap down could happen as well... Who knows, I dont know, but I am buying.
667 2018-02-11 16:27:09 ppl that want stocks to return to quick gains (and thus even more stretched multiples) are kinda like fuck it we'll just have a bigger correx later? I mean vals were gaining way ahead of growth.

669 2018-02-11 16:25:01 #stocks#StockMarketCrash If we've learned anything in the past week, it is investors who hope to survive a crash and build wealth MUST diversify into at least 5 asset class: bonds, stocks,commodities,real estate, cash  or cash equivalents.
670 2018-02-11 16:24:57 Of course, and in that sense capitalism isn’t working in stocks either since that small group monopoly can most likely predict what each member of the group will do (buy/sell)

673 2018-02-11 16:19:35 Well I understand you get what you pay for. I'm more educated with stocks. For example, I think a good investment is in the local power company, after all you pay them every month anyway. That's a practical, value investment. Anything in crypto similar?
674 2018-02-11 16:17:27 Imagine if E*TRADE did competitions for stocks... this is a stain on crypto and disappointing to see from @binance_2017 supposedly the best of the best. @cz_binance needs to stop with the games

680 2018-02-11 16:11:46 If Wall Street is so damn smart then why do we keep having these Crashes??? In 2008-2009 the taxpayers had to Bail out Wall Street! You know how many from Wall St said we should buy stocks right until the crash occurred AND while it was occurring???
681 2018-02-11 16:10:44 I’m actually getting better at freestyles 

Too bad I’m way to embarrassed to try in front of people cuz my high school taught me people who pursue their dreams even when it’s far fetched are laughing stocks.

697 2018-02-11 15:54:22 I'm honestly not 100% sure what your point is either. But withdraw implies the money is yours either way (as is the case with bank accounts). For stocks and crypto, it's not - no matter the number your assets are valued at, you have exactly zero dollars until someone buys them.
698 2018-02-11 15:53:39 Not owning stock is not the only way the stock mkt creates wealth. It allows money to flow to biz for construction manufacturing sales etc tthereby fostering jobs for the poor & middle class who don't own stocks but benefit from the jobs & wages the stock mkt creates
699 2018-02-11 15:53:20 There also seems to be a widespread perception that as long as revenue and EPS growth is intact, stocks should move higher.  1970s showed that doesn’t necessarily hold.

706 2018-02-11 15:48:21 Was about to send ya this s-t chart. Correlation bonds(blue) /stocks is going nuts..very volatile. If  we da squeeze fails and $spx stalls you will have a rally in $tlt. Makes sense as "s-t hedge" and even it doesn't :) it is very crowded... s-t downside is limited imo
707 2018-02-11 15:47:58 Your article mostly makes sense. But the “holy grail” for most mature investors is to create income plus growth. Selecting stocks with good dependable earnings and decent dividends is the only way to achieve this goal. Smart investors know this and will benefit long term.
708 2018-02-11 15:44:42 @BlackWolfBeers I am looking for so where to buy your beers in the Lanarkshire area, my local Lidl no longer stocks your trashy blonde or Tundra can you help?
709 2018-02-11 15:44:16 @MariaBartiromo    We the common people who have no stocks or stock from our employers, feel this market plunge was an organized HIT on the market.  We feel the Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, George Soros and crew organized the plunge!  Why isn't anyone following the money?!

716 2018-02-11 15:39:33 No. It’s just that I’ve lived through many bubbles, and this has the feeling of one to me. Too many people have short or no memories of past asset class downturns, be it stocks, real estate, or tulips
717 2018-02-11 15:38:03 That’s my thought as well. Hoping for $122-$123 soon. Friday it rallied while stocks hit lows, then reversed as stocks rallied into the close. Also hoping I get the bigger moves right with stocks this week.
718 2018-02-11 15:38:01 It's already taking place but some stocks are stronger and may remain sideways during that correction.
719 2018-02-11 15:37:48 You must not own stocks or you would know what a crash is. The market doesn't go up everyday moron it's the best long term investment there is tho.

724 2018-02-11 15:35:21 If we're supposed to judge POTUS on stock market performance, shouldn't we be really judging each of them on a total market portfolio? If stocks skyrocket, but bondholders get washed out, that shouldn't exactly count as a success, should it?
725 2018-02-11 15:35:20 Even in 2003 we’d sold out every week and we came bottom! Probably low to be fair, that was a dreadful season.

735 2018-02-11 15:28:17 So people sold their bond funds to avoid losses as they anticipated interest rate increases. They moved their funds into stocks. But stocks dropped! What to do?

764 2018-02-11 15:09:48 As an accidental investor: if corporations are going to use their big tax gifts from US to buy back their own stock, aren’t they incentivized to drive stocks lower? No doubt cashed out high to get their gift. Not a new trick.
765 2018-02-11 15:08:02 My thought on the sell off of stocks ,I blame the brokers they knowingly sold off stocks of the people's stocks that were invested of the 401k , peoples stock was sold w\ out their permission\holders of 401k plans call ur broker tell them not to sell ur stock# listed on statement
766 2018-02-11 15:07:48 Stocks are not up traditional catch like COD have migrated north due to global warming hence Scandinavia being more attractive
767 2018-02-11 15:07:22 Yeah. Those high stocks, low unemployment, businesses bringing back jobs, energy dominant, home buying on the rise and consumer confidence high, really sucks.
768 2018-02-11 15:07:18 Hopefully soon!

776 2018-02-11 15:01:14 I just got my paycheck and thanks to Trump I see $2.37 more due to the tax reform. I also see a loss of $80,320 in my stocks. Tell trump he can keep his $2.37, I want my retirement back!!!
777 2018-02-11 15:01:03 It's called a correction..the market goes up and up and up and up and then down, it's called a correction. Do you do any sort of investing? Do you have any idea how the market works? People sold stocks... there were more for sale than people buying..taking profits.. a correction.
778 2018-02-11 14:59:06 So why did your moron in chief increase deficit projections when there was no need? Unemployment was low and going down, stocks up, economy climbing. Not a time for government stimulus with massive tax cuts to rich
779 2018-02-11 14:58:41 Having pot stocks makes me feel like I'm sticking it to the man.
780 2018-02-11 14:56:25 Wall Street always opposite of Main Street. So stocks down while people seeing growth. Opposite. #letitrip
781 2018-02-11 14:55:57 We do alright for a rugby league city, that didn’t watch footy until the 60’s. The truth is due to our success we have a nationwide fan base and the local support can be accused of being apathetic but extremely passionate. So much to do in West yorks
782 2018-02-11 14:53:52 Yet we love our paychecks, employment #s, millions of food stamps n welfare, stocks up, repatrioting of our jobs and money, MAGA is no longer slogan but a reality.
783 2018-02-11 14:53:37 After last week's 10% decline, the number of stocks with EV/EBIT< 5 rose from 37 to 44. As recently as 2015, there were 61 of these opportunities (2012 - 162, 2009 - 345). Unfortunately, the value opportunity is still limited in the US market.
784 2018-02-11 14:53:08 DJI from 2000-2011 was flat for stocks, a "lost decade." 

Not sure what point you're trying to make, but cute emojis!
785 2018-02-11 14:51:47 hi sir boomie, how do you know if a stock is an ALPHA, how do you screen stocks?
786 2018-02-11 14:50:23 That's it! Homework done. I'm ready for this week's trading. Stocks in focus $MAC $WLCON $TUGS $PIP $PIZZA #PSEi #stockmarket
787 2018-02-11 14:50:22 oh Dear, Sir. if you had the right people  around you , you would have known to expect this, and that stocks going up and up and up  , not necessarily a good thing. you have to expect corrections.
788 2018-02-11 14:49:55 The fact Trump gets a spending plan that increases discretionary spending by $300 bill, make the Debt will increase by $420 billion over the next 10 years, pushing the budget deficit above $2 trillion, & Stocks struggled through another whipsaw day & no one wants to admit is sad
789 2018-02-11 14:48:13 I’m interested to know how you believe ever escalating private rental prices, and the simultaneous reduction of social housing stocks will do anything to to reduce homelessness and poverty? The system is broke, time to fix it.
790 2018-02-11 14:48:00 Stocks have dropped for the week to an all time largest drop in two years.
791 2018-02-11 14:47:31 I watch my stocks like a hawk to learn market patterns. But, I keep it long term. 
792 2018-02-11 14:47:21 And if we make the assumption of safaricom stocks he would be worth 800 million without a single input from his salary....but as I earlier said your lazy mind wants the easiest conclusion..he stole...but he didn’t steal yours...did he?
793 2018-02-11 14:46:15 Only tiny bits get to tax havens. Look at the foreign company owned parts. They are not off in tax havens. Almost all profits are pensioners pots. Stocks are where most pensions go. No profits, no pensions. No gains in stocks, pensions cost you a lot more, or get much less.
794 2018-02-11 14:46:06 Sheffield is also a university city and have combined average crowds of above 52,000.
795 2018-02-11 14:45:04 @Bamabroker Thoughts on steel stocks here SLX
796 2018-02-11 14:45:01 U.S. stocks close higher but lose over 5% for week, TSX ends down   Superficie corporis, aquae marine frigore et pondere, compressa et contracta, interstitia fibrarum occluduntur: particulis incrementi novis partes abrasas reficientibus, locus non datur. #FelizDomingo #charwomanf
797 2018-02-11 14:44:39 It is a fact stocks have risen big-style. Also, many foreign boats are able to fish our waters and break rules, overfishing then cherrypick what they want to land, discarding so many unwanted, immature fish killing them - further depleting stocks.
Despite this, stocks are up.
798 2018-02-11 14:43:50 We’re a uni city with no industrial background so mostly Uni money and new City money whilst surrounded by old industrial towns with sizeable supported clubs Bradford/Hudders etc. A Leeds team doing well could see crowds of 50k if the ground supported it
799 2018-02-11 14:41:52 This why you have 0 followers, #Troll. Everyone who reads my blog knows I predicted the route in Oil, would be the catalyst for the route in #Stocks. #Winning $Bigly
800 2018-02-11 14:41:32 @cspanwj I'm an agnostic now and I'm buying penny M.M. stocks right now ..I was buying mostly "to big to fail" bank stock
801 2018-02-11 14:41:12 Today I have been tasting various chicken stocks, in order to find one I like as looks like Knorr have withdrawn Touch of Taste.
802 2018-02-11 14:40:59 Any screener available for high tight flag patterns for nse stocks?
803 2018-02-11 14:40:34 Sheffield have a population of 500,000 and their two teams combined are bigger than Leeds United. All the money in the West Midlands is ploughed into Birmingham which means places like Wolverhampton struggle.
804 2018-02-11 14:38:36 We also have one of the most successful cricket and rugby league teams in the city, we can do all sorts in Yorkshire, plenty to see and do Wolverhampton’s pretty grim
805 2018-02-11 14:37:15 Then why do you own stocks?
806 2018-02-11 14:35:33 Are there lawyer stocks????  If there were, with the indictments that are coming down, investing in lawyers would be a great ROI!!!!
807 2018-02-11 14:35:06 The latest downward spiral of the market had virtually no impact on the income or wealth of most American families.   84 percent of all stocks owned by Americans belong to the wealthiest 10 percent of households.
808 2018-02-11 14:34:33 I’d actually guess they will lose money soon, the media is starting to cover the outcry of hate and their stocks will eventually start to tank
809 2018-02-11 14:33:53 These are my top 3 reasons to receive a Vine2 BETA! 
1. I will invest in the stocks 
 2. I am a dream chaser in dire need of a new platform to insert my content! 
3. I too am against inhumane qualities , therefore with my music I shall change the millennial generation #postivity
810 2018-02-11 14:32:55 عندي انابيب ابي ابيع بجم السعر
811 2018-02-11 14:32:53 I’d expect Leeds to have a bigger support with them having a population of 750,000 and being the third biggest city in the country. That’s three times as much as Wolverhampton.
812 2018-02-11 14:31:59 This new Snapchat update is Terrible..no wonder their stocks are dropping like a rock.. If its not broke don't fix it!!
813 2018-02-11 14:31:58 Because stocks are actually backed by business often creating real-life value and not just magical internet money with no real purpose? :-)
814 2018-02-11 14:31:11 It’ll rebound, that’s what stocks do. It has been a huge success and will continue to be successful and your leftist’s tears will continue.
815 2018-02-11 14:30:08 Need to explain programmatic ads to your Mom? It's like the stock market, except ad impressions are traded instead of stocks.
816 2018-02-11 14:29:40 Thank you Jake we can all get on with our Sunday. I will get back to staring at another season in the championship you boys concentrate on the prem #notJealous
817 2018-02-11 14:29:21 So I got the Siri stock last month and stocks plummeted down two Friday’s ago . I haven’t checked yet because I’m afraid , Especially with Amazon’s Alexa taking over I’m guessing Siri is about to be thrown out the market 
818 2018-02-11 14:27:19 @cspanwj I’m not concerned I hv a few stocks but trust my guy he said don’t panic
819 2018-02-11 14:26:31 @cspanwj Many Americans don't understand that investing is something you have to watch like a hawk.  You should never assume anything when it comes to stocks, bonds and commodities.
820 2018-02-11 14:26:26 the article does say that only 10% of americans own 84% of stocks and it says that a majority of those are white but it doesn't say how many of them are jewish or christians. that would have been a real news story...everything else we already knew
821 2018-02-11 14:26:16 yet anyone with a computer and a few dollars can go online and buy some...

even few of my friends (who are all in the evil 1% like me ) own stocks because they are afraid of them and don't understand it

failure of education or a faulty system ??
822 2018-02-11 14:26:13 Retirees don't have time to wait for market to come back but they advise because of longevity to stay in stocks and bigger allocation to equites.
823 2018-02-11 14:25:23 COAT!  However, you should know more that 401k plans rely heavily on stocks and more than half of all Americans own stock.
824 2018-02-11 14:24:33 I spent good 2 hours looking at what funds and PMS schemes are holding these days. Its amazing how 'Value funds' are holding FMCG and Auto stocks trading at multiples of 50. I cant find my magnifying glasses..
825 2018-02-11 14:23:32 Are you completely flat? I haven't heard you mention any stocks you own
826 2018-02-11 14:22:49 ok....kennedy. #bullspit--that's why i went from Sheriff Brown+the BS Patrol

#GMOs are contaminating organic. Glyphosate=AB, where was medicine?
Buying stocks-Tobacco-Coke-Gates-Koch-BioTech-Patents only--BIG MESS
827 2018-02-11 14:21:30 With all due respect, traders are shorting vol. Investors continue to dollar cost average into stocks & index funds for the long term, regardless of short term anything. As we’ve always done. 
828 2018-02-11 14:21:00 I sensed at the fly fair yesterday that there is a growing contempt for how easy modern nymphing methods make it to catch fish. Should we be exercising some restraint considering the pressures our native fish stocks face already? It's an interesting question.
829 2018-02-11 14:18:30 The first crash on the unofficial Bombay Stock Exchange was 1865. Even then the US economy responsible. Stocks had risen on speculation about American civil war results. When the war ended cotton crashed, stocks followed. Gujarati and Parsi traders lost their financial fortunes.
830 2018-02-11 14:17:44 Stocks I think share dealing or the like I forget the particulars
831 2018-02-11 14:17:40 what about hugo stocks :0 :D
832 2018-02-11 14:15:58 Wolves are one of the best supported clubs in the league! Granted, not as much as Leeds.
833 2018-02-11 14:13:07 ANN vix values for today 0.04% which is comfy & <0.15%, this week end the VIX has settled to bullish phase, the key vix numbers will come tomorrow morning, if its <0.15% then s per ANN its time to bottom fish some quality stocks, i am eyeing Bayer corp after the recent drubbing.
834 2018-02-11 14:12:19 suffered a 50% drawdown. Luckily the market is huge and has to offer many great companies. Why would I choose those at risk of becoming “battleground stocks”?
835 2018-02-11 14:10:10 According to a recent survey conducted by Blockchain Capital, 30% of those in the 18-to-34-age range would rather invest £1,000 in Bitcoin than £1,000 in government bonds or stocks.

838 2018-02-11 14:08:48 The EU imposed quotas in part to stop the seas being fished to oblivion. It worked. We have fish in abundance thanks to careful fishery management. Can't see the environmentally illiterate Brexit brigade doing much to preserve fish stocks.

854 2018-02-11 13:54:05 Yes, it has come to this. I am now reduced to following the PRIVATE PRISON stocks to see what the KOCH BROTHERS may be doing.

861 2018-02-11 13:50:06 Too much work. Invest in the companies that will. Sell stocks selectively. Use newfound wealth to screw with the NY real estate market for reasons which will make no sense at the time. Harris Tower has a nice ring to it, don't you think?

865 2018-02-11 13:45:44 Agreed! On the other hand, putting together a portfolio of stocks means choosing only those cos that meet certain criteria. Mine certainly are a great business and a great management, and $BABA meets them both. But I also require clear accounting and a conservative way of
866 2018-02-11 13:45:10 Interesting, didn't know you recommend non-Biotech stocks. Any specific area outside Biotech you focus on? FireEye is good, has high beta, will be a wild ride in this market. Timing is important for this and it is impossible too..
867 2018-02-11 13:44:55 Stocks can be delisted too
868 2018-02-11 13:41:01 *stocks!!!!!
869 2018-02-11 13:40:26 What other "investment option"? Stocks should pay dividends. Real estate call be used for many productive purposes. #BitCoin was supposed to be a better form of money. If it doesn't perform that role it's just Beanie Babies you can't even comfort a child with.

873 2018-02-11 13:29:32 Asset diversification. Plus not all traditional investment vehicles offer crypto. As of right now, stocks offer a regulated market so by nature less volatility and less risk. #BTC
874 2018-02-11 13:28:10 It’s because most people who trade stocks are smart, whereas trading crypto is mostly a bunch of morons with memes and rockets praying they will go to the moon.

892 2018-02-11 13:08:58 I own stocks, and can tell you that the Tax Scam bill is to blame for the downturn. Expect more major losses in the market in the weeks ahead. Trump is poison to financial markets.

898 2018-02-11 13:01:03 Addition to the above, request to kindly confirm in to which stocks - advised by you, can do averaging or by additional quantity of stock.
899 2018-02-11 12:59:17 Since most of the people sounding bullish on #stocks. I believe there is still room left for further correction. Waiting and watching.
900 2018-02-11 12:59:07 I did think of buying stocks for my hubby as a valentine gift (He would love that) but I planned to save more and buy him stocks as his birthday gift in June. Sticking to a strict budget for valentine so I need cheaper options for gifts.
901 2018-02-11 12:56:28 You are right, because Ashley has a thick skin and can’t be got at, the frustration gets misdirected and that’s the biggest damage Ashley does to the club. He hides behind ‘protests affect the players not me’ - he should be put in stocks on gallowgate each home game...

So why is Soros going to such lengths to flood Europe with hordes of third-world Muslims?

We can’t be sure, but it has recently come to light that Soros has taken a large series of “bearish derivative positions” against US stocks. Apparently, he thinks 1/2
907 2018-02-11 12:45:07 Besides, nobody has been buying bonds the last decade because the interest rate is approximately zero %. If interest rates rise then bonds will be an attractive alternative to Stocks for investiment dollars.

926 2018-02-11 12:28:26 I never lost money on stocks will little knowledge. I lost a lot with crypto right away. Crypto is extremely volatile. Stocks are safe in comparison.

His eyes would widen in horror as the words “Make America great again.” Are uttered by congress.
933 2018-02-11 12:22:32 I like this idea, when the charts as shit as possible you know that’s a huge amount of people that aren’t buying it. Means the stocks gonna be cheaper - with a bit of size and a semi illiquid stock you could probably make chart say whatever you want. Not saying it happens but yeh
934 2018-02-11 12:21:12 Stock investing is never meant to be easy. We've to assess if it is a temporary or a permanent setback. I offer no opinion on individual stocks.

943 2018-02-11 12:13:34 Don't spend more than you earn. Get rid of debt first. Make a plan. Look into passive index funds - invest the market, not stocks. If you get a raise, live like you didn't. Add it to the fund. Cook your own food. Compound interest builds wealth. Start young.
944 2018-02-11 12:12:26 When Dems win, we must undo all the tax breaks to the corporations/rich.  They are buying back all their stocks to get rid of all the small investors.  This was the plan.

948 2018-02-11 12:04:59 Many problems with that - highly migratory species, straddling fish stocks, ability to exploit and the right of other states to fish surplus. Especially if we snub our nose to our biggest and closest market or end up with tariffs or worse still sanctions. #BrexitImpact
949 2018-02-11 12:04:41 No, I'm sure there are special stocks of super untainted a Gardasil for the kids of the elite or something. 

(No, there aren't. For starters, screwing with vaccines is very strictly illegal, e.g. you cannot compound vaccines the way you can virtually any other liquid drug.)

954 2018-02-11 11:57:47 Never understood why stocks that have done well shouldn’t continue and those who have lagged shouldn’t lag. If a co does well it will rise. Mid caps small caps will do well as long as they deliver. Current results support many mid n small caps

961 2018-02-11 11:38:07 #Sundaythoughts - If the stock market just dumped or traders pulled out it would make little sense to then go into riskier trading in crypto.
Likely if a trader just made good profit in stocks they'd take a bit of the winnings & go into crypto.

Yet the markets are in turmoil...
962 2018-02-11 11:37:00 I agree. Drawing is describing phases of a bubble. Bitcoin is not a bubble. It can’t be compared with stocks. We’re in uncharted area heading into a 5-10 trillion crypto market cap

971 2018-02-11 11:16:21 I guess that's a rhetorical question, but will still answer: More n' more people are moving away from it. And when you are in stocks for several years already and doing well, it's hard to switch to something new. The more money you have in stocks the harder the decision to switch
972 2018-02-11 11:13:53 Given the required returns for funding pensions, how does this not end with a QE like program for stocks, that put an effective floor (& ceiling) on returns?

All I ask is that if there is no dark age then simply buy me a beer and say I was right all along. Fair?
984 2018-02-11 10:58:56 Because they know that for stocks there's something useful produced all the time. What gets produced for altcoins, speculation, darknet markets merchandise, tax evasion, money laundering? All harmful for the society, trade tulips or South Seas shares instead, be better off.

1002 2018-02-11 10:36:36 Because their bank blackballed them from crypto money transfers, so they trade stocks for liquidity.
1003 2018-02-11 10:35:46 So those with big profitable positions in January will be unnerved. This is especially so for the big US growth stocks. The dip is far too minor for a buying opportunity (relative to US stocks' rise over the past 3yrs). #trade

1028 2018-02-11 10:03:08 Please ...who cares.. I know loads of fund managers that have gone to more speculative ASX stocks instead of other products on the ASX as that’s where the money is as do we all no matter our experience .. but I certainly don’t know any who make stupid posts like this
1029 2018-02-11 09:59:08 Guess it will depend on what level of stocks the government is happy to carry. Anytime production is well under demand it opens up the question on imports which can be interesting for a swing country the size of India.
1030 2018-02-11 09:58:55 Did you miss the 666 point drop Friday? Or the >1,000 point drops on Monday or Thursday? Trump once said if the stocks drop 1,000 points the president should be shot into the sun at tremendous speed.

Dont invest more than 50% of ur savings
Dont invest more than 10% of allocated fund in 1 stock so mathematically u can buy max 10 stocks
Dont invest more than 5%(10% for short term) of allocated fund in a stock in one time.

1053 2018-02-11 09:27:33 Yep probably because everyone knows the stock market is a scam & FANG stock companies are being shady buying up their own stocks with negative interest rate loans from shadier central banks who know that’s exactly what they’re doing cause banks do it with their own toxic debt!

1114 2018-02-11 07:55:44 It’s the UK & its fishing industry itself that did that by flogging their quotas. And it was never 100,000s. The CFP preserves the stocks that UK fishermen fish (which, btw, aren’t in UK waters so the CFP allows UK fishermen to fish elsewhere). But don’t let facts get in the way

1154 2018-02-11 07:19:35 Those who blame the EU for decimating the UK fishing fleet forget that "progress" played its part. Boats are now far more effective at finding and catching fish. Fewer boats are needed, especially as the same "progress" also depleted the fish stocks.

1188 2018-02-11 06:24:06 Here are some interesting #FACTS: About 54% of all Americans own stocks. Despite the fact that 46% of households owned stock shares either directly or indirectly through mutual funds, trusts or various pension accounts only 10% of them account for 81% of stock aggregate value.

1207 2018-02-11 05:57:17 When I look at this tweet it’s full of ignorance on economy dynamics...if keriako invested in land or stocks for high performers like safaricom...wouldn’t this be the case. To educate you and @gathara kindly check the price of an acre of land in Thika rd in 2011 and in 2017!
1208 2018-02-11 05:56:37 Trade or invest? Stocks are a relatively low risk way to preserve & grow capital over the long term using both fundamentals and technicals. Altcoins are mostly a gamble on which 5 coins survive to be integrated into a global financial system 20-30 years from now. Very high risk.
1209 2018-02-11 05:54:56 In structural corrections, the stocks going back up are not necessarily the same as the ones that’ve been falling.Hence,even if indices are expected to rebound, portfolios should let go of losers, instead of waiting for the bounce back.
1210 2018-02-11 05:54:41 And rarely do people ask whether a 40-60 pe stock can earn profits atleast equal to its mkt cap within a decade or two or even a lifetime. A bond requires payback of Principal+interest. But in stocks people forget payback analysis of their outflow

5 'risky' shares to avoid?…
1218 2018-02-11 05:46:03 Dividend investors get all excited about stocks that barely move, but they get .38 cents per quarter.  How about stocks that pay $38.00 per quarter, because they’re actually growing companies?
1219 2018-02-11 05:45:21 Yes, miners need Gold and Silver to stop falling, and Silver may be the first to do that. A general rally in stocks into the close Friday didn't hurt either - shows how Miners are affected by stocks in general too.
1220 2018-02-11 05:42:12 Ensuring ISI to take the stocks of our security and allow them to Target us. Is this not Anti Nation?
1221 2018-02-11 05:41:34 We also need better guidelines and enforcement at the federal level. If a state had a law against bump stocks you could just drive one state over buy 50 of them at a show and bring them back.
1222 2018-02-11 05:40:32 I have spent the last 3 months studying investing. Stocks and cryptocurrencies. Recently I've discovered airdrops (before a crypto company launches, they give away free 'shares' to build a brand) this is one of those companies #FreeMoney
1223 2018-02-11 05:39:24 The Trumps are some of the least successful real estate developers in NYC. He's a failure. If he'd put his family fortune that he inherited into Index Stocks he'd be worth roughly $30B today. In other words, had he retired 30+ yrs ago he'd be worth 3× his "claimed" net worth.

1256 2018-02-11 05:10:10 Another measurement could be average PE ratio of sensex. As of now it is above 20 25 levels which should come down to 15 20 levels especially PSU stocks with single digit PE ratio. That should be the correction  bottom level
1257 2018-02-11 05:08:28 I didn't answer because you know nothing about stock market,but if you want.
SPX follows 500 strongest stocks (among 7000) so if Donald owns any,it would be SPX long term.If SPX goes up his stock is probably up as well,but I'm sure he sold it long time ago and is in cash now. OK?
1258 2018-02-11 05:08:07 ... We'll get our fishing waters back, build fleets of trawlers, our market will grow like it once did, apprenticeships, jobs, coastal towns brought back to life.

1264 2018-02-11 05:01:28 Historical data does show that  stocks directionally change trend “shortly after” the change in interest rate trend. The $$$$ Q is the gap in time and the magnitude of changes that matter

1274 2018-02-11 04:56:22 Dow rose 10,000 in 8 years of @POTUS44, from 8,000 to 18,000. Dow rose 8,000 in @POTUS first 15 months, from 18,000 to 26,000. I've nearly doubled my IRA in the last 18 months with stocks like AAPL, SHOP, and PYPL. I'll tolerate a 2000 point correction every now & then. #MAGA

1276 2018-02-11 04:55:37 The majority of grain stocks in the world are turned over in a year, except for ending stocks.

The CO2 that is stored in grain is released each year when fed to livestock, but we capture the CO2 right back with the new plants making grain for next year.  It’s a cycle

Is this a wrong approach?

1297 2018-02-11 04:32:58 What happened in the stock exchange?
1. Top 10% bought stocks with their tax savings, to fluff up their net worth
2. That artificially inflated the exchange
3. Other people bought in
4. The stocks hit the price at which the 10% told their brokers to sell
5. The bubble burst

1311 2018-02-11 04:08:17 They go the opposite ways - low bond prices = higher yields.

So the money is flowing out of stocks and into bonds with high yields.

The more money chasing bonds pushes the price up and the yields fall.

Is that correct ?
1312 2018-02-11 04:08:02 Should add to the quick bowling stocks also.
1313 2018-02-11 04:07:46 QE didn’t work at all.  It started in September 2008, the market didn’t stop falling til March 2009.  Since then market up in spite of excessive government growth.  Earnings pushed stocks up.  Bernanke has never fracked a well, or written an app.
1314 2018-02-11 04:07:27 I dont think so bc all stocks/bomds etc transactions are traceable
1315 2018-02-11 04:07:19 Serious answer: risk profile. Stocks share some risks like volatility and liquidity, sure, but counterparty risk is considerably reduced when you've got a broker you can call for support and transactions that aren't necessarily permanent and irreversible.
1316 2018-02-11 04:07:12 @evanspiegel hi ur stocks are down by more than 60% and many people are deleting ur app due to the update get rid of it and fix this mess thanks

1324 2018-02-11 04:03:36 A lot of misinformed people invest in internet stocks and there are people that speculate over their price. One example is Amazon. Amazon, as Chamath points out, is a great investment. The fact that there are people that don’t know what they are doing and that invest in AMZN
1325 2018-02-11 04:03:25 Soy boys can't handle the extremes of trading altcoins so they stick to stocks.

1331 2018-02-11 03:55:54 Also as a reminder : JP Morgan is coming up with its own trading platform in May/June.. with stock markets falling more and more there good chances of people moving funds from stocks to crypto with the news that SEC is encouraging it.. the dynamics in the near term will change.
1332 2018-02-11 03:55:29 The average investor doesn’t understand crypto at all. That means that the market is very inefficient. The average investors of internet stocks don’t understand http or the underlining technology behind it. I understand the level of understanding is diferent

1335 2018-02-11 03:54:12 Reason for the market to go up:
1) the rich man's tax cut

Like with the 2000 tax cut, the result was too much money chasing too few investments. Mortgage equities back then. (That worked out well.) Stocks today.  Stock prices will inflate. Then crash big time. Enjoy.

1344 2018-02-11 03:49:15 Not yet, assumptions based on the stocks performance so far. Add in their financials and other recent additions the company made I look with optimism. Quarterly reports will be what give us a better understanding on where this stock will sit.
1345 2018-02-11 03:48:55 and yet no answers, but you think its the bump stocks fault? why not try something tangible to focus on, like deportation of illegals, theyre more likely to be a problem, lets ban them.
1346 2018-02-11 03:43:16 Wall Street analysts are paid to make investors thinks their stocks will go up w/ buybacks.  I think $ going towards worker retention will surprise you, because it costs 50% of a salaried employees’ annual wages to replace them.

#Bitcoin > $100k

This is nothing for this new digital asset class, when it has the potential to replace not only currency, but gold, bonds, stocks debt etc. Have faith

This is a financial revolution

1365 2018-02-11 03:31:52 For investing I really like @MotifInvesting - low commissions for individual stock trades. They have products they call ‘motifs’ that you can trade. It’s like buying a weighted collection of stocks for a lump sum instead of buying individually.

1367 2018-02-11 03:31:07 Very common in stocks too, but seems to take place over a longer time frame.

1369 2018-02-11 03:31:03 No worries... For each $100/month I park into stocks, I should retire with $70,000 more as a low estimate. I'd rather that than car payment that's six or seven fold, which I'll put into it all.
1370 2018-02-11 03:30:03 I am slowly figuring that out but I figured you still trade penny stocks here and there? Do you not trade penny stocks at all? I know you just said basically you don’t but being mentored by Superman I figured you did sometimes?

1384 2018-02-11 03:10:44 Let’s see how everything goes. There’s too much data about stocks on crypto just like the internet when it came out. This is just the beginning. The ones that people mostly use on daily basis like media and entertainment are the winners. Is too early to discuss...

1390 2018-02-11 03:05:21 Remember back in the Great Recession, when stocks crashed?  Investment firms that had many women in VP positions came out better than those with men. Women didn't expose the companies to as much reckless, stupid risk as the men did.

1396 2018-02-11 02:56:17 Stocks stocks! Haha.
1397 2018-02-11 02:52:47 Yawn..I'm getting tired now...For a guy who knows his stocks and trading sure asks a whole lotta questions doesn't he? lol
1398 2018-02-11 02:51:45 I don’t short stocks so I don’t really care but after checking you are correct! When I do trade it almost always is to short using SP500 futures & frankly I follow my own system as confirmation of  probabilities of Elliott Waves and social mood! My system dating back to 1974—

1400 2018-02-11 02:51:25 I wonder what their stocks are like, lol.
1401 2018-02-11 02:50:56 Could $SECI go above $1k? Seems if they win even just $100MM would be $305 per share. $500MM would be around $1700 per share lawsuit is possible multi billion. TYCO in May settled a $3 billion lawsuit with their investors. Is my assessment accurate or am I missing something?
1402 2018-02-11 02:49:51 Soon you will be able to move your Stocks/Bonds and everything related to the STOCK market into an offline type storage like the Trezor and Ledger vs. holding at a broker. If that is your choice.

1406 2018-02-11 02:41:45 Exactly. He isn't interested in the truth. One can only hope his stupid ass has all is money tied up in losing oil and gas stocks.

Not blaming you.  It is a Blaze commercial.
Just thought you should know.
Love ya man!!
1431 2018-02-11 02:16:59 I don't ever short stocks. I only play longs. If you look at my Tweets, you will see all the stocks I am in and interested in. I'm in big on dsgt. I'm in rnva. I flipped ifxy 3 times last week. I have a couple more long shot gambles going but no shorts ever.

1435 2018-02-11 02:13:05 The booze lady in town stocks this but keeps it in the back. She won’t sell it to anyone under 30, and tells me even then some 30 yo+ men still don’t pass her standards.
1436 2018-02-11 02:12:35 i dumped all cryptos not that i had alot and kept 9963 digibyte bu r am going to bu u ibto greener stocks by weeks end
1437 2018-02-11 02:12:00 Depends on the timeline. In 20 years I'm betting on crypto being the safer bet. Of course by then stocks will basically be crypto currencies themselves. Ownership shares will be put on a blockchain and will be easily bought and sold through exchanges like cryptos

Changed the game for me. Next day settlement, trading blue chips like penny stocks, 1000% runners and can define risk better.
1441 2018-02-11 02:05:03 Crypto is riskier than stocks...lol.

1453 2018-02-11 01:55:48 Saw an article on this today but can’t seem to find it now. About 1-2% is liquid cash. The vast majority of their worth, about 60-70%, is tied up in business interests. The other 30-40% is a mix of home, cars, retirement accounts, stocks, etc.

1456 2018-02-11 01:51:39 You must not read, stocks have dropped. Companies laying off many employees, wages low. But hey that 1.50 a week in your paycheck may get you all hot and bothered.
1457 2018-02-11 01:51:19 Hey no one wants ur fricken update, take it back! You're gonna fuck up my stocks too fr @Snapchat
1458 2018-02-11 01:49:59 Haven’t done the research, but I bet internet stocks ~1995 had a similar run up / sell off (albeit less volatile). Would have missed 95 - 01
1459 2018-02-11 01:48:57 lol that's called manipulation my friend.  Mm's buy a bunch and then take it down on small sells. If you watched L2 on it day after day after day you would see these MM's don't wanna lose their shares, sometimes when stocks have MEGA crazy awesome news the mm's hold it down
1460 2018-02-11 01:48:33 Sometimes ya just have to suck it up and get out. Or, be prepared to hold for a real long time and hope. I'd rather have the cash to invest in winners and stocks prime for a run up. I know, it's hard to get out when waaay down and holding... AND hoping. Hope is not a strategy.

1467 2018-02-11 01:42:04 You’d be surprised Ken how much clarity you’ll find in really paying most attention to stocks with high relative volume with clean charts and with a clear trend-not choppy.
1468 2018-02-11 01:41:36 Wells Fargo sucks. I bounced a check for the first time ever in at least 25 years and they wouldn't take the $35 overdraft fee off my account.
1469 2018-02-11 01:40:18 That is exactly what I thought since shorting a stock has to be done on upticks! Perfectly legal! However in order to profit off of this trade they will have to buy the same stocks at some point in the future to balance out! A short squeeze coming up or more to the downside?

＞When I see markets fall as hard as stocks did last week, shortly after a run of consecutive record-breaking new highs, I think of only one planet’s correlation or influence: Uranus.
1487 2018-02-11 01:20:09 Yet jobs are up, stocks are at record highs, unemployment down, minorities are at lowest unemployment EVER, foreign relations are greatly improved, more US jobs, & so much more. I’ve voted both ways in the past, but regardless of his indiscretions he’s doing great & is our POTUS.

1489 2018-02-11 01:17:45 Since previous tax cuts never led to long term wage growth, why would this one be different? That said, it does seem to have reignited a real fear of inflation, which overwhelms any benefits of a tax cut for workers, and will weigh down stocks going forward. But do tell!

1498 2018-02-11 01:11:08 It's an odd question but my answer is that having a really attractive investment opportunity reduces a person's marginal propensity to consume, regardless of whether the investment is holding a cash balance of money or stocks/bonds. tldr btc is my money and yes I am spending less
1499 2018-02-11 01:09:33 Because the Russian bots are good for Twitter stocks. Makes people believe people are really using Twitter as much as they are. That's my guess. Profiting off fake Russian trolls.
1500 2018-02-11 01:09:12 It’s so hard not to throw all my money into stocks.
1501 2018-02-11 01:07:03 So many problems with surveys like this. It compares millennials who *do* invest in stocks with those who *would* invest in crypto. But even this survey shows there are massively more young people in stocks (a third!) than crypto. 1/

1507 2018-02-11 00:59:50 3/ Unemployment is low, but How is it measured? Part time jobs are not as good as Full time jobs. And This time seems similarly to 1987. A “Tv President”, Trump and Reagan, Big budget and trade deficits, yields on the rise while stocks fall, low unemployment, fear of rate hikes

1515 2018-02-11 00:52:33 It depends entirely. Could be a guy with a million in his pocket and nothing else, or could just be a guy whose value are the stocks in his company he owns, could live in a shoe box.

1530 2018-02-11 00:35:59 I think the headline is misleading. I think less than 5% of millennials are invested in bitcoin. I guarantee a larger percentage own stocks.
1531 2018-02-11 00:35:47 It's deemed property, stock is property too... Securities: a certificate attesting credit, the ownership of stocks or bonds, or the right to ownership connected with tradable derivatives.

1544 2018-02-11 00:23:40 Man, the stocks, bro. 

Probably the most millennial thing I’ve ever said.
1545 2018-02-11 00:22:56 Lol... my good brother... with due respect, I doubt if you really know what a high configure stock exchange platforms operate... specially in Gambia.... where the level of awareness is 20 years away still.  What kind of stocks/shares will be trading in the Gambia?

1548 2018-02-11 00:18:38 These were not banking stocks. They were stocks I purchased and were custodised at the bank I’ve been a client of since childhood.
1549 2018-02-11 00:17:01 Not even joking but the world is running out of drinkable water... ppl are buying stocks for freshwater, flint is running out, Cali is, and now Cape Town, soon this will be an epidemic, I’m telling you, the next war will be over water #wateristhenewoil

1551 2018-02-11 00:15:36 Sorry to hear this. I haven't heard this one under #FATCA. Your bank is gong over board on owning bank stocks. Are you serving on your bank's board as a member of board of directors?

1558 2018-02-11 00:05:24 You should consider that people were expecting the tax reform since Nov. 2016 and the tax reform was the main reason for the rapid growth of US stocks in 2017. However, I should add that I am still optimistic about US stocks market  until the midterm election.

1565 2018-02-10 23:51:59 Over the 11 years from 2000 to 2011 the Dow Jones Industrial Average saw a total cumulative return of 0.70%. It’s now commonly accepted as a “lost decade” for stocks. #epistemology
1566 2018-02-10 23:49:57 In 1966, Americans were protesting the war in Vietnam. By 1982, the national memorial to the conflict was being dedicated.  $1000 in 1966 would have just $335.75 worth of purchasing power in 1982. “Stocks for the long haul” over that period was a disaster. #epistemology

1575 2018-02-10 23:37:07 Top 20% own 92% of all stocks. About 52% total have stocks, showing how little 401ks take in stock value.

The stock market is not important to the majority of Americans. Many will never touch it. Companies don't pass stock profits on in meaningful ways.

1605 2018-02-10 23:27:32 I didn’t admit any such thing. I said I hope they do since I’m an owner of many stocks. Buybacks make money for me. But hiring is at an all time high. Highest in 45 years.  Money for those jobs must be coming from somewhere.

1607 2018-02-10 23:23:31 Candidate MISLEADING COVER HEADLINE OF THE WEEK: the Wall Street Journal's "Wild Week for Stocks Ends in Gain"--uh, no. Actually, stocks (US large caps) ended the week DOWN 5%. True, Friday's close was above Thursday's, but it was BELOW that of the prior 49 trading days.
1608 2018-02-10 23:21:48 Actually it’s quite genius. No different then penny stocks and small caps.

1612 2018-02-10 23:17:20 Now, it is possible that we flip to the pre-2000 world as deflation fears completely dwindle. In which case, stocks may get a double whammy from inflation fears and rising real rates.

1616 2018-02-10 23:13:03 The idea is crypto will become the currency of choice, replacing fiat. If everyone is using it, it will never lose its value. You can say the same thing about gold, stocks, and even the dollar. What happens if more and more people decide to pour their dollars into crypto?
1617 2018-02-10 23:12:23 Nobody is talking about

1618 2018-02-10 23:12:09 So now most S&P 500 stocks are below where they were before the tax reform bill was passed. Does that make sense to you?  It doesn’t to me.

1622 2018-02-10 23:09:37 @narendramodi sir, a suggestion about LTCG in stocks ,why cant a slab payment be introduced instead of 10% for 1 lakh . will it not be better that no tax for less than 25000, and 3% for 50 etc , additionally can be 25% less tax if held for 1 year or more.
1623 2018-02-10 23:09:29 On tge subject of stocks: I really liked the concept of The Unincorporated Man, btw, that is, the idea of splitting up "ownership" in a person like in a corporation. Sadly, the book did not really explore all the implications too deeply.

If it weren't cumbersome, I'd totally
1624 2018-02-10 23:09:15 The top 10% own 84% of all stocks.
The top 20% own 93% of all stocks.

The bottom 80% share the remaining 7%. 

46% of Americans do not own stocks.
1625 2018-02-10 23:08:00 Agree with that, but historically stocks underperformed when unexpected inflation was high, which I assume made real rates lower. 

Also... I just want an excuse to own inflation swaps.
1626 2018-02-10 23:07:57 But then again these peeps thought $btc was pricey too at $19,000.

1657 2018-02-10 22:39:21 Crypto will become the market. 
As stocks facilitated capital formation for the industrial age, 
crypto is here to facilitate transactions in the now post-industrial age.
1658 2018-02-10 22:35:31 you were right Alex; deep state used strzoks wife to plunge stocks
1659 2018-02-10 22:34:30 Hard to believe that the man in the Oval Office does not know how stocks work
1660 2018-02-10 22:32:48 I am happy your husband is benefiting. The $1.5 trillion giveaway to corporations will only benefit shareholders as corps buy back their stocks. I can’t tell about jobs. A lot of layoffs. I don’t think the tax bill benefits Main Street nearly as much as Wall Street. ACA works.
1661 2018-02-10 22:32:38 Imagine investing in internet stocks and without any real idea of what the internet is.

1666 2018-02-10 22:25:15 I don’t use stocks and crypto for income; I used them for my future. Day trade, no. Investments, hell yes.  HODL if you here me!!! #hodl
1667 2018-02-10 22:23:54 Enormously misleading tax cuts > gov't shutdown > large sale of stocks marketed as a "dip" > gov't shutdown > plans to collapse social security > ??

1673 2018-02-10 22:17:08 hopefully it stays above the pp price for a while, they are coming out at a traditionally slow time in MJ stocks, the slow down after canopy ER in mid feb to april. For sure this year is not same as last few.
1674 2018-02-10 22:15:54 Nothing was ever done about the bump stocks... The NRA has so much power over the Republican party. And now there is evidence of money laudering through the NRA.
1675 2018-02-10 22:15:02 This Marxist Lite shower would blast the economy back to the Stone Age.

I suggest everyone stocks up on beads just in case. 

And sell the bitcoin as there won’t be any electricity to trade them! 
1676 2018-02-10 22:14:41 Yeah. I'm not so celebratory of ordinary folks exploiting loopholes, because that's how we get to bump stocks, rolling coal, and finding a peacock sitting next to you, which is a legit thing to be upset about.

1682 2018-02-10 22:10:39 I think so but who knows.
Pullback on DXY (EURUSD) to test lows one last time?
Would give stocks some breathing space too. In the last few hours before close it looked that way.
Rig increase had little effect.

1689 2018-02-10 22:05:23 Gold only a temporary investment. Never a long term one! Compared to stocks. Stocks are long term subject to bull & bear markets. Bull markets are long. Bear short. Each is different. Timing very difficult. More to do with luck than skill. No consistent timers. Don't trust any!

1703 2018-02-10 21:54:55 Just have to take a look at XLE. Top two holdings: Exxon Mobil Corp is 22.61% & Chevron Corp is 16.96%, so 39.57% of your energy exposure is in 2 stocks. As a professional portfolio manager, I would never put 40% of the portfolio in 2 names.

1731 2018-02-10 21:25:25 But it's all okay, Mueller is on it and the truth will out. So I suggest you all keep moving to the right until you reach the right side of history. Ten years from now you will all be laughing stocks for supporting a traitor

Nope.

You just tweet nothing.
1738 2018-02-10 21:14:00 You doubled the deficit during an economic boom you inherited ( like everything else) and now a year in as your policies kick in, stocks are tanking.

1742 2018-02-10 21:09:46 The worst type of propaganda.  Take one incident to smear an entire minority.  How about we talk about Stephen Paddock and the 10/1/17 mass shooting Vegas?  Too soon to talk about universal background checks and banning bump stocks?

1748 2018-02-10 21:06:55 Yes and the stock market is down over 5%. You must have something to do with this. You do! Increasing the deficit will require more government bonds to be sold which will increase the interest rates on those bond - investors will take money out of stocks putting them into bonds.
1749 2018-02-10 21:06:50 Forsure know some stocks to invest in

1755 2018-02-10 20:59:10 No because evidence of buying in some individual high-quality stocks. But the low from Friday should get backtested & build support rather than another v-shaped bounce. I don't watch 30-min chart, just daily and then 5-min. Can easily judge/see other time frames though a 5-min

1780 2018-02-10 20:33:31 Stocks goes up & down. Venezuela is Bernie's dream for America, not sure why.  Sweden & Norway are very expensive, I'm not rich like Bernie.  I can't afford his Venezuelan paradise.
1781 2018-02-10 20:33:15 Lazer long UPS & adding on further weakness. I shorted AMZN @ 1438 & covered, but was a nice scalp. Shorted nvda 248, covered 232, another nice one. When ppl on MSM say stocks are “God like” (fast $’s Carter Worth) i dont care how beasty it is.. nflx Visa, i consider the short...
1782 2018-02-10 20:32:49 mayyyyy with the 3

1785 2018-02-10 20:32:15 I'm putting in a BUY order for military and weapons stocks Monday morning. 
1786 2018-02-10 20:32:14 “Fishing for Leave” actually means “Leave us alone to suck the North Sea dry so I can buy a new Range Rover” 

Those pesky EU scientists, protecting fish stocks so they can be sustainable 
1787 2018-02-10 20:28:41 couldent of said it any better myself . 2018 will separate the boys from the men. Smart money is buying on some stocks that got hit hard with strong fudmentals . Correction dosent last forever and there is alot of money waiting to get back in.
1788 2018-02-10 20:26:30 I haven't done a flat % down.  For breakouts I set the SL at point of entry.  For "buying at bottom of setups", I usually find a key resistance point / trend line and set it at that.  For Stocks, I wait for the candle to close below, for crypto I make it specific.

1790 2018-02-10 20:25:40 I wouldn't trust what @mcuban says when it comes to stocks.  He stated more than once prior to Trump becoming President, the stock market will crash.  He even put his money where his mouth is and hedged his bets and shorted the market.
I went from loving @mcuban to disliking him.
1791 2018-02-10 20:24:27 Yes #TRX #TRON is not your day trade get rich quick token but it is a longterm steady growth kindof like some of your good safe stocks. Too many influential people invested for it to fail. Also has one of the most populous country backing it. Look at #NEO and its history
1792 2018-02-10 20:22:13 All my Stocks going up! Proud moment for a Share holder of over 3 companies and multiple shares 
1793 2018-02-10 20:21:55 Share buybacks increase the value of stocks held by shareholders.
Rising 401ks, healthier companies expand & employ more people.
1794 2018-02-10 20:21:55 So my mom put money into stocks and she lost some money on it so this woman is CONVINCED that they're stealing money (the bank). I'm trying to explain to her how stocks work but now she's on the phone with BMO ready to tell them off.

1796 2018-02-10 20:18:38 Yea, that’s how stocks wo.. damn it almost got me this meme is good I know it’s a joke but l was legit about to argue. Haha hah
1797 2018-02-10 20:16:52 A minority of the "craft" market stocks sours regularly - and they have maybe 4 distros supplying, plus brewery-direct - across more than a dozen breweries doing things in a "sour" category. They can buy something different every week for a year (and ongoing).
1798 2018-02-10 20:16:22 Over 40% short, any god news and $AKAO is lit.  All abx stocks weak, $PRTK back to where it began its run
1799 2018-02-10 20:15:47 I personally prefer the M4 platform just because they’re shorter and usually run 16 inch barrels, and almost always come with a retractable stock. Unlike an M16 platform where they’re usually fixed stocks running 20 inch barrels.
1800 2018-02-10 20:15:45 $spy..StockTwits Sentiment Table..Lots of bearishness in the major indexes, but individual stocks still pretty bullish.
1801 2018-02-10 20:15:02 I know the truth. Becky in Miami ripped one then lied about it. That's why stocks went down.
1802 2018-02-10 20:14:32 Blame the fact of the stocks falling now that we see Trump has no hair! Coincidence... I think not.
1803 2018-02-10 20:13:34 So long story short . Although I am not 100% right all the time . I try to help people from the learning lessons from my pass. 1) profits are always good 2) your dd counts . 3) try to stick with stocks that has great fundamentals although not all of them 100% workout
1804 2018-02-10 20:13:07 How about your lies:  I’ll release the Democratic memo: LIE.  I’ll work on DACA if you settle on our budget: LIE.  The TRUTH you tell would be: “I’m ruining our country,  I’m making America laughing stocks of the world AND, I support men who sexually assaut women.”
1805 2018-02-10 20:12:24 A smart person would heed the advice of a wealthy person. Try taking some advice from @RealDrGina instead of being so bitter about the place you’re in. You don’t have to be rich to invest in stocks.
1806 2018-02-10 20:12:03 Stocks struggle to find footing, closing down for the week:KABOOM ! KABOOM ! KABOOM ! AND DA 2015 BELATED GREATEST DEPRESSION OF ALL TIME IS JUST AROUND THE CORNER BROUGHT ON BY THESE VERY SAME REPUBLICUNT CORPORATE "KOCH"-SUKKAS !!!

Alto capex é +'mente correlacionado com pib, mas -'mente correlacionado com stocks returns. Teremos vários anos de baixos capex no BZ.
1810 2018-02-10 20:07:40 You say people won’t go to that trouble to make a bump stock, but look at all the lengths he went to planning this crime. Bump stocks are easily made.
1811 2018-02-10 20:06:26 Congrats to the happy couple! I just bought stocks in Kleenex!... cuz there are gonna be lots of Elba fans with tears of envy to wipe away!  Thank gawd my mascara is waterproof.
1812 2018-02-10 20:05:55 Why because one crime was commuted with a bump stock. What now ban everything that can kill someone. The bump stock likely saved lives because it makes the gun horribly inaccurate. Bump stocks are easily made at home.
1813 2018-02-10 20:05:46 I wonder how much it would cost to buy a couple Discord stocks?
1814 2018-02-10 20:04:41 The richest 10% of Americans own 84% of all #stocks. This is why you don't need to celebrate or worry when the markets go up or down. You don't actually see any benefits to a positive gain market. You just hear about it on the news.

1818 2018-02-10 20:04:08 Also important to keep in mind that #EricNuttall's portfolio has an annual turn over of 160%, according to him.  He adds that he considers it his job to make money for his clients by "trading" high beta stocks. If you are just a BNN viewer, you're not a client of his,
1819 2018-02-10 20:03:06 I just wouldn't buy GOOGL at current valuation.  Could easily go up, but it's overvalued to me and there's so many other stocks to go after.  It's following trend too, and it's only 3% of the S&P, so it's not super contradictory.  Just doesn't match what I am looking for is all.
1820 2018-02-10 20:02:48 You tryna invest in stocks ?
1821 2018-02-10 20:02:26 He looks set for a huge night tonight. Orlando big man stocks are depleted and Giannis was quelled last night. That's a potent mix.

1832 2018-02-10 19:56:57 Seeing a lot of opinions re: what caused the stock market meltdown. Let me try to explain, as there are several interrelated factors. 1) Interest rates are rising in response to inflationary signals, resulting in higher bond yields, which hurt stocks as a lower-risk alternative.
1833 2018-02-10 19:56:15 Trump was beating his chest about how great the stock market was doing. What he didn't say was that the richest 10% own 84% of all stocks.
1834 2018-02-10 19:55:24 If it wasn’t for the EU managing and protecting stocks these guys would have hoovered every fish out of the North Sea to line their pockets and left the sea a desert.

1838 2018-02-10 19:50:46 A military parade for this stupid bastard posing as a President. That disgrace should be in stocks and have tomatoes thrown.
1839 2018-02-10 19:50:29 if the VIX is high, SELL "puts" on stocks you love at a price you'd like to buy them at. this is because big institutions need the 'insurance' (a bottom). it's the one way (only?) where being small > big. worst outcome: you buy a stock you love at a price you like.
1840 2018-02-10 19:48:54 “I was gonna cash in my stocks and buy and island. But that’s probably a pipe dream. I think they froze my assets. Which is why all my cash is in the closet.”

1843 2018-02-10 19:47:49 made a screen but only 33 stocks came up.. am i doing it wrong or is the market that inactive right now ? using TD Ameritrade's screener ?

The economy fundamentals are FANTASTIC, largely thanks to #Trump.  The stock market downturn in NO WAY signals economic woes.

1848 2018-02-10 19:44:04 @StevePearlstein  We have had no volatility for years (sub 10 vix) then we get massive amounts all at once. As one strategy unravels it forces heavy selling and there is no natural buyers of stocks on the way down (specialists) providing ample liquidity. Buy algo's just cancel.
1849 2018-02-10 19:43:43 Whatever Mike T wants the team would be smart to do the opposite then they will no longer be laughing stocks of the league making dumb decisions.

2.3K 
From there it completes the correction ( we test 2x the bottom ) and we bounce
During same time : stock market will bleed. Oil will be under pressure, not good for stocks. Stock deserves 35%-50% correction.
Wait & See.

1859 2018-02-10 19:37:34 Will a Tory have to publicly come out in favour of putting poor people in the stocks before they're called 'far right' by the main stream media? Funny that it's only the left that get dubbed 'far' anything.

Well, not really funny, more of a blatant MSM biased narrative.

1867 2018-02-10 19:30:46 It goes down due to your incompitance and the fact that we all knew companies would buy their stock back.  If you resign I'll bet the stocks go back up.
1868 2018-02-10 19:30:34 What would you define as reasonable? What indexes/stocks should be covered?
1869 2018-02-10 19:30:02 This is what will happen with FPC!
1- the blankning Will lift FPC.
2- no One buying no One sale and every day trading of 10 million+/-.
3- Go down to the list of small stocks!
4- so everyone can says buy buy to the money and live in dreams of smartcard, in display, cars.
1870 2018-02-10 19:29:39 Surprised that LT Bonds and stocks moved down together this week? You don’t know history; 1973-9/1974:
S&P 500 = -42.6%
DFA Equity Balanced Strategy Index = -37.3%
20-yr Corp Bonds = -10.3%
20-yr Gov’t Bonds = -6.1%
5-yr T-Notes = +4.9%
1-yr T-Notes = +12.5%

1872 2018-02-10 19:25:51 Incorrect. Only non-Prohibited Persons (i.e. not felons or adjudicated mentally unfit) can purchase a firearm (any) from an FFL. An AR-15 (or any semi auto, since they make bumpfire stocks for several) does not become full auto once a bumpfire is attached.
1873 2018-02-10 19:25:26 But, but…I thought we were going to have roaring inflation and the necessity for the Fed to raise interest rates 4 times in 2018. If we have roaring inflation, doesn’t that mean the oil price goes up? Which would be good for $FANG and other oil stocks?
1874 2018-02-10 19:25:15 SMASH 4 GENERALLY USES 2 STOCKS NOT 4 WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE
1875 2018-02-10 19:24:50 Stocks vs flows. Dimensional analysis.

It looks stupid when journalists compare dollars with dollars/annum, and it doesn't look any smarter on Twitter. 

Sorry to call you out, sir, but we should learn from our mistakes.
1876 2018-02-10 19:24:49 How about he was a bad dude who wanted to kill people. some people are - why they shouldn't have assault rifles much less bump stocks and all the other crap.
1877 2018-02-10 19:20:59 Agreed .....people run away from stocks the same way as shown running away from sanitary pad in the movie
1878 2018-02-10 19:20:39 Wait til next week and hopefully you can still say that, but stocks taken the largest drops, two at that is not good. The ones ready to retire or that were planning on retiring may have to put a hold on that thought.

1883 2018-02-10 19:17:33 How much did you buy in stocks the last year?  You should be too rich to mess with Twitter.  Knowing you , you knew trumps economy would take off so you put a million or two in stock market didn’t you.  Share what stocks you bought last year and how much you’ve made?
1884 2018-02-10 19:15:20 In any context where Treasurys keep selling off, this would make sense ... most participants fail to recognize that Treasurys and stocks could be correlated to the downside here

1888 2018-02-10 19:13:57 It’s just as important, perhaps even more important to screen out the negatives as it is to screen for the positives. If you could just eliminate the worst 10% of all stocks and choose randomly from the rest, you would beat the market.
1889 2018-02-10 19:13:10 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to treat your EDS

1893 2018-02-10 19:06:42 Credit card companies will always survive, people will always buy things on credit even if it's in bitcoin. Merchant fees might just be less. And if I was 18 years old, I'd max out my cc and buy bitcoin and file bankruptcy if it crashes. Can't buy stocks with cc either.
1894 2018-02-10 19:05:46 Why do you think passive investments (ETFs and index funds I assume) will be sold off faster than individual stocks?  Or am I misinterpreting?
1895 2018-02-10 19:04:54 Of course it isnt. But when bump stocks are added, its a different story
1896 2018-02-10 19:04:09 Senate Democrats: We got bump stocks, the VRA, gender pay regulations, and reproductive health care parity.

Senate Republicans:  We tweeted a bunch about how dues are processed.

Did you move when we banned full-auto?
Did you move after the Brady Bill passed?
Are you packing up now that Bump Stocks are becoming illegal?
Will you move when we repeal the 2nd Amendment?
1904 2018-02-10 18:58:18 Banks still received help who in turn kept the money stocks shares bonds rose, top 5% benefited from this. Banks wouldn’t lend to small business and hence thousands folded all under the watch of the coalition government
1905 2018-02-10 18:57:56 That statement is beyond dumb. Unless you were in a coma when the tax cuts were just handed out by the GOP. Corporations are so delighted they're buying back their own stocks.
1906 2018-02-10 18:57:47 If only people were actually better off financially because of it. Consumer goods and food gone up accordingly. Ever heard of supply and demand? Economics really isn’t your forte even though you claim otherwise. BTW, how many stocks did you personally sell this past week?
1907 2018-02-10 18:56:53 8 years under 44 and no indictments, 11 months under 45, 2 guilty pleas, 2 indictments, 1 can Secretary left for gross travel abuse, CDC Dir left after trading tobacco stocks
1908 2018-02-10 18:56:08 Lol, I have a widget on my phone for my stocks and I was like "MY MONEY!!" all week this week XD but the time to buy is on the down falls so it kinda worked out for me.
1909 2018-02-10 18:56:04 Good for you. You must be Ace at picking stocks because the market is up 17.7% since feb 10, 2017.  Not 400%.
1910 2018-02-10 18:55:15 Bet tissue stocks went up due to that episode.
1911 2018-02-10 18:53:34 and all these SCUMBAG analyst pieces of shittssss who said to buy all these tech and biotech stocks which CRASHED - theyre screaming off top of their lungs to sell short tsla- and ALL THROUGHOUT these years IT HELD BOUYANT while theyre ' buy rated ' stocks COLLAP[SED lost ppls $
1912 2018-02-10 18:53:11 This is a buying opportunity. Like a Black Friday sale. Put your big boy panties on, and go out and buy some J.P. Morgan, Walmart, Boeing, Microsoft. Then sit back and look at it six months from now and be freaking happy you listened to me. #StockMarket #Stocks #retweet
1913 2018-02-10 18:52:47 Is anyone at the BL and using the 1684 Atheist (Otway)?

1916 2018-02-10 18:47:01 @RayDalio Sorry Mr. Dalio which #principles are driving you to short through #BridgewaterAssociates more than 13 bln of Europeans companies stocks?
1917 2018-02-10 18:46:59 But onl God knows what ur doing now, you’re probably trading stocks on Wall Street and vacationing in Fiji on weekends
1918 2018-02-10 18:45:36 Don't pin your hopes on a perfect stock market when you retire.

Remember if you retire and Medicare and social security is not there, you might end up with these stocks.
1919 2018-02-10 18:45:35 I don't own any stocks either so meh.
1920 2018-02-10 18:45:26 You clearly don’t know shit about the stock market Ed. Percentagewise this MUCH NEEDED correction was less than half of what #Obama’s treacherous fall was.  Educate yourself before you post! #StockMarket #Stocks
1921 2018-02-10 18:45:01 All fishing fleets scream for more quota. It's one of their ingrained habits and it's why fish stocks plummeted before they would take any notice of the scientists.
1922 2018-02-10 18:44:02 Bitcoin is one of the best revolution i have seen in my lifetime. But his price was speculated from the same corrupt mentality who are speculating stocks, bonds... @MarkYusko

1927 2018-02-10 18:37:35 Thank god they are as the government has no interest in banning bump stocks it would mean less $$$ for Trump’s largest campaign doner.... that we know of...
1928 2018-02-10 18:37:07 Go bomb Assad now, leave the stocks for the economists!
1929 2018-02-10 18:37:01 Not in your world sir, you have tried and convicted more people than I can name on Twitter of all places.  You have crashed company stocks for no reason.  You have made false claims the size of which this world has never seen.  And you played more golf than Barack Obama.
1930 2018-02-10 18:32:31 I don't invest in stocks and bonds....I invest in people. #people1st
1931 2018-02-10 18:30:15 literal  tears  are in my eyes  im going  to bed wake me when it re stocks

1933 2018-02-10 18:28:46 Moron-in-chief is not entirely evil: "The “Trump Slump” in gun sales has had a punishing effect on the stocks of US-based firearms manufacturers." Now that's a real shame.I guess 300 million guns in this country are enough.
1934 2018-02-10 18:28:15 STOCKS BOUNCE IN HELL WEEK
DOW TRAVELS 20,000 POINTS
1935 2018-02-10 18:27:29 What a difference two weeks makes. YTD 1500 stocks up and 3137 lower. Two weeks 72% higher and now 32% higher. $SPY $IWM.
1936 2018-02-10 18:27:16 Trump took all the credit for stocks soaring. Obama is to blame for last week!!!  Right?

1946 2018-02-10 18:19:56 I'm just mad cuz I recommended to my friends and got some stocks now they're making me look bad and wasting my time
1947 2018-02-10 18:19:21 Stock market tanking...who cares. What millennial would even touch stocks when you can 10x your money in a couple months in crypto?
1948 2018-02-10 18:17:45 And,10% of those who own most of these stocks take advantage of people's anxiety, play their emotions to bring the stock prices up, up, high, then, sell all out at the highest peak! Then the majority, average, stock holders, become the bag holders, and the scumbags win again! 
1949 2018-02-10 18:16:51 The stock market crash of 2000 resulted in the 2001 recession being one of the mildest GDP declines since 1948 because most households are not exposed to stocks. That’s in contrast to the housing crisis where most households were exposed.
1950 2018-02-10 18:16:36 Penny stocks baby
1951 2018-02-10 18:15:48 @KateHoeyMP no doubt UK fishing would be better off not having to stick to EU quotas that have saved fish stocks. It’s lack of investment that killed UK fishing! Not EU.
1952 2018-02-10 18:13:38 Say what you want about our president, but the stocks I purchased in Twitter are making me a very happy man! 
1953 2018-02-10 18:13:10 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to cure your autism
1954 2018-02-10 18:12:41 Looks like you don’t know the difference between stocks increasing value, profits from sales, and wages. 

Good job.
1955 2018-02-10 18:12:36 Amen. I've been contacting you and you keep ignoring me. You locked my account and took my stocks.
1956 2018-02-10 18:11:51 I love it when conservatives reveal why they are truly laughing stocks. They deride everyone as "PC Nazis" yet shatter like fragile glass figurines when the humor isn't to their liking. Yes, she is making a call to arms <insert eye roll>.  Enjoy the mid-terms, Snowflakes.

Something else they can falsely blame on Trump.

1962 2018-02-10 18:08:17 Interesting Dilemma in the market — stocks get whacked, and yet still look expensive. Yet bond yields are rising so bonds no safe haven. So where to hide?
1963 2018-02-10 18:07:47 HAHAHA you must not own stocks and have your head in the sand. Yes this is a made up story, The stock market was just fine last week. Move along nothing to see here.
1964 2018-02-10 18:07:40 General warning! All stocks can possibly go down to to 0$ this year.
1965 2018-02-10 18:07:36 And McDonald's, Wendy's, Jack in the box stocks fall into toilet with all their income boycotting them.
1966 2018-02-10 18:07:35 2-3 hours will be the time when the stock data would not be on the computers. I know one of my managers who would issue a cheque (in 90's) to buy stocks, it would take three days for his cheque to get realized.
1967 2018-02-10 18:05:29 Economy up, Regulations way down. 2.5 million new jobs added. Unemployment down to 4.0%. Biz, stocks, manufacturing way up- record levels! America safer; we have great respect around the world. Making friends and allies, exposing enemies. Most of all people and God first in USA!
1968 2018-02-10 18:04:11 Get in early, while stocks are still cheap.
1969 2018-02-10 18:01:47 Yes, Piccadilly doesn't. Thankfully Westfield London stocks it.

1976 2018-02-10 17:55:19 you buy bitcooin and put it into stocks. like educational gambling
1977 2018-02-10 17:53:34 @AliVelshi Seems to me as though the people that sell just prior to a "correction" and buy again after the "correction" make a whole lot more money than those that hold on to their stocks during "corrections" @SRuhle
1978 2018-02-10 17:51:21 same in spx 2 weeks ago on Friday everyone went short and stocks went stop loss hunting full parabolic and collapsed cause shorts didnt use stops this time around, should have stayed short for longer looking back now
1979 2018-02-10 17:51:12 What about stocks?
1980 2018-02-10 17:50:59 Enjoy! The Senegalese techniques for building stocks and depth a la minute really upped my cooking game.

1982 2018-02-10 17:49:09 When there is euphoria around many rushes to buy all the high flying stocks not giving any due thought to the valuations but when there is huge discount sale almost all back off in taking a position.

It needs a gut feel to act the reverse which will only be done by very few.
1983 2018-02-10 17:48:57 So just to be clear...
We thank Obama for rise in stocks and blame Trump when they fall? 
Sometimes it's hard to get the double standard right since it's so frequent these days.
1984 2018-02-10 17:46:31 Well see this is how it works, first we ban bump stocks, then we ban semi-autos. Their used on a battle field and we don't need them in the streets. Period.
1985 2018-02-10 17:45:43 Soros in Davos, Switzerland said he would take Trump down by 2020.  President talks about stocks.  Stock market tumbles.  Hmm
1986 2018-02-10 17:45:09 i went to 85% cash and 15% dividend stocks early last week , just watching for a while to protect capital.
1987 2018-02-10 17:43:59 I never follow anyone's recommendation blindly,no matter how reputed he is in the markets.I always research the #stocks first. If what is recommended does not meet my final research analysis,then I dont buy it.Even for my recommendations I advise all to do their own research.
1988 2018-02-10 17:43:49 > get wasted

1989 2018-02-10 17:43:32 Do you apply your short strategy to large cap stocks and if so do they have a better RR the small caps? Also do the same setups apply?
1990 2018-02-10 17:42:53 He already a lame duck. I doubt he going to do any thing good. His tax reductions are not helping economy. Already rates are soaring bringing down stocks. Pretty soon they can precipitate a recession. Even his billionaire cronies will suffer as stocks tank! Destructive Trump!
1991 2018-02-10 17:41:47 Don’t worry about these guys. 1, They have the money. 2, they’re too busy buying the stocks that have lowered in price. 3, after all is said and done, they will make more than they lost.
1992 2018-02-10 17:40:40 One of the things that I wish parents did more was discuss issues related to finances. Credit, stocks, bonds, interests rates, reading income statements, cash flows, the ability to analyze liquidity & profits. I am guilty of learning way too late! #lifeskills

1995 2018-02-10 17:39:24 Some of this is fun with numbers, although I get your point.  This looks at  10%+ moves during the ‘07-‘09 period as unique events.  Going from the 10/07 high to 3/09 low stocks -57%.
1996 2018-02-10 17:39:15 I heard he owns some stocks of them and Sirius satellite radio
1997 2018-02-10 17:39:10 I did have a broker license. But I was too bad in trading stocks. LOL. Now I want to be a nurse and a automotive technician. What a life I have had. So what I told u about market isn't a nonsense. It was the experience I learned in a hard way. Trillions gain or lose is normal.
1998 2018-02-10 17:38:45 Gold Miners are now simply mining “stocks” and do not correlate to “gold” - just like October ’87. Arrrrghhh!
1999 2018-02-10 17:38:29 USDA did it to the grains again. All three of the major crops had a surprise in Feb’s S&D numbers.  Wht saw a 25 MB cut in exports a 5 MB increase in food demand, corn’s exports increased 125 MB, and beans saw a 60 MB cut in exports.  The changes showed up as increases to stocks.

2002 2018-02-10 17:37:52 It feels a lot like looking at stocks multiple times per day. There’s a maybe a conflict between the game mechanics to keep us using the device and what value the devices actually provide.

2006 2018-02-10 17:34:52 Sir Suggest few stocks at this juncture.
2007 2018-02-10 17:34:39 So true. Market is playing with an open hand. Indices bring all stocks down but you know the ones holding up best are being accumulated on the dip by institutional money. The ones that already reported earnings are a safer bet
2008 2018-02-10 17:34:32 I really hope if I'm nice to u, stocks won't lose another 2 trillions. But my pinned tweets haven't been read. When market decides to go down, it won't stop until it reaches the goal. Just sit tight. Don't worry. Stocks r up & down all the time. Get used to it. Good news is good!

2020 2018-02-10 17:25:03 #stocks hit a “correction,” a 10% drop from their 1-year high. Relax, that’s how markets are supposed to work! #VelshiRuhle @MSNBC 12:30pmET
2021 2018-02-10 17:24:06 Say what you will about Trump, he’s done a ton to close the wealth gap between people who own stocks and people who don’t.
2022 2018-02-10 17:23:17 TBF there are some similarities: both cats and stocks do whatever TF they want to do, and the owners think they are better off owning them than not owning them.

2024 2018-02-10 17:22:47 @EAB1087 @RampCapitalLLC what do you think of #lithium players like $PWM and $XMG? Their stocks have been on a tear until recently
2025 2018-02-10 17:22:31 Poor middle class. We can't invesr  in Stocks . So happy for you.  Just like DJT only thinking about the rich.
2026 2018-02-10 17:22:17 All well & good.  However money moves around. If interest rates are to rise then that money moves from volatile stocks to more stable interest earning investments. It's the health warning of life - Things can go up & also down :)
2027 2018-02-10 17:21:44 Hey Peter Maria Barotoma on Fox says same thing , you never says anything, remember she was beating the drums about bank stocks in 2007
2028 2018-02-10 17:21:31 Hi Sir, I have been following u for quite some time. Really appreciate your efforts in reading and sharing with us your stocks study. Want to know the stocks you own till date, not to imitate but to compr n undrstnd my Portfolio, if i hv missed any!! Thanks @stockduniya
2029 2018-02-10 17:20:00 If take a look at history, you will see that all this does is create a black market in the state for bump stocks. This is just another "see, I care law" that really changes nothing but the market place.

2034 2018-02-10 17:17:15 Nice to hear! Gonna check out the graphs for those stocks. I'm soo curious!
2035 2018-02-10 17:17:02 Well diversified portfolios are replacing those of stocks alone. Thanks to investors losing faith in central banks and fiat currencies, they have to look to a strategy of diversified risk to include foreigstocks, precious metals, EM sovereign debt,currency plays,and REITs.
2036 2018-02-10 17:16:50 Absent stocks retaking records and then some you are probably right.
2037 2018-02-10 17:16:41 ? Okay? Do you know know how stocks work?
2038 2018-02-10 17:16:32 3/..companies to sell their shares of stock in those types of companies but I also suggest selling all automobile manufacturing company stocks also because cars could become all but a thing of the past in the afterlife.  That could be why a major mass production of electric cars

2054 2018-02-10 17:10:59 if ya want the actual answer it thought you were referring to a stock - there’s hashtags for stocks but instead of “#” they start with “$” 

ex. $GOOG $APPL $TWTR
2055 2018-02-10 17:09:54 Bahahahahaha! Look at Julian Assange trying to stay relevant! Go back to hiding in some foreign consulate. The entire world thinks both of you are laughing stocks!
2056 2018-02-10 17:08:59 I was asked, did you sell any stocks you own, with the Dow sell off? Not one. This period will pass, as all the “corrections” did, remember Y2K? 9/11? Oil Embargo? and several other drops. Most of them, I looked for bargains and bought shares when others panicked.
2057 2018-02-10 17:08:55 I know that investing can change lives. I'm for the little guy, Q: If you are conscientious, and do your dd, can you turn $5000 to $1m in five years trading penny stocks?
2058 2018-02-10 17:08:19 It will be good for those youth who are in the row of waiting.
2059 2018-02-10 17:06:14 Two police for act hopefully. Join us my way now they should on health insurance stocks given the. The nation full meeting today to wish press.
2060 2018-02-10 17:05:06 Yeah, there are a number of stocks $aapl $glw that are starting to look really good long now, but will see what the market does and get in w/ the trend.
2061 2018-02-10 17:04:59 Here is another stock charts scan for US stocks with RSI 30 
[type = stock] and [30 x RSI(14)]and [country = us]
2062 2018-02-10 17:04:55 This is quite interesting, personally I picked up a few stocks that I thought were bargains.
2063 2018-02-10 17:04:18 Haha tp esok dah last day dah. Kalau pegi 10am pun, im not sure if there are still stocks left to buy 
2064 2018-02-10 17:04:17 Thanks for sharing,Patrick! Very interesting look. Big fan of Canadian stocks. I own some $TECK $CCJ $EGO $NTR. Teck held up really nicely this past week.
2065 2018-02-10 17:03:13 Yes m a s/w professional.UI side i need to work,I admit as m a novice in this area.M planning for a fin startup,thinking of more ideas.

2066 2018-02-10 17:03:12 If ethos delivers, and people will really move away from Coinbase we'll be in for a treat. At the end of the day Crypto, stocks, shares, its all a gamble, but within that I feel good having my money sit in Ethos which could have a real use-case
2067 2018-02-10 17:02:53 I don't know about y'all but I want stocks and bonds
2068 2018-02-10 17:01:10 I’ve never done well enough in penny stocks to notice the patterns in volume 
2069 2018-02-10 16:56:35 Many parallels to the decline of tobacco sales. I removed all the big sugar stocks from my RRSP 15 years ago.
2070 2018-02-10 16:55:06 Is @Google aware that as a company publicly traded there are strict rules for their behavior towards the public? Could this be why some of their stocks are tanking?
2071 2018-02-10 16:55:02 Now let's be honest here.  The stocks that comprise the index now are not the same as those in the index in 1987, so this graph is absolutely meaningless.  It would be like comparing points in college football now to those in 1987.
2072 2018-02-10 16:54:01 Or just a rich one who stocks up on Girl Scout cookies.
2073 2018-02-10 16:52:41 And how bout those stocks, huh? Oh yeah. Let’s not talk about that. Or the democratic response memo. Omaroso is just getting started...
2074 2018-02-10 16:52:15 I could be wrong, but watched $SPY trading at 4x-5x the average daily volume for the past 6 days. And... timed very conveniently. Will look more into the market as a whole. I've traded enough penny stocks to know what a pump and dump looks like. Gave me pause.
2075 2018-02-10 16:50:49 NOW is the time to BUY STOCKS.  I just read that THIS LITTLE CORRECTION is just part of the MACHINERY OF A HEALTHY, DYNAMIC PRICING AND VALUATION PROCESS.
2076 2018-02-10 16:50:00 #stocks hit a "correction," a 10% drop from their 1-year high. Relax, that's how markets are supposed to work! #VelshiRuhle @MSNBC 12:30pmET
2077 2018-02-10 16:49:49 Sorry I don't have pic of the shot gun but I know he and a few other guys drilled holes in stocks for shells.
2078 2018-02-10 16:46:42 I only trade stocks too so...correlation is just a cost of the game.  Good to know. Thank you.
2079 2018-02-10 16:46:03 Soon we shall have a talk about how foreign agents use fake bonds to pump U.S. stocks in very organized pump and dump schemes.
2080 2018-02-10 16:45:51 Trump in the the White House is as close to an elephant in a China shop when it comes to our economy. At this point it seems like skyrocketing deficits, inflation & basically continued degradation of the middle class at hyper speed. Refinanced in 2017,   Stocks to bonds in 2018.
2081 2018-02-10 16:43:29 Ca va encore ! ^^ Chez excalibur-comics ils proposent le Watchmen à 95, et Batman et Darkseid à 89. Par contre PNJ et Daytripper sont encore à 39e.. Et quand tu vois leurs stocks, tu te rends compte que Daytripper ne s'est vraiment pas beaucoup vendu. C'est dommage je trouve...
2082 2018-02-10 16:43:10 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to improve your chronic fatigue
2083 2018-02-10 16:41:04 Self inflicted damage. Triggering A50 without a Plan A, let alone a Plan B, is looking a bigger gamble than Arthur Scargill taking on Margaret Thatcher. He had no clear mandate either & with coal stocks high a similarly weak negotiating position.
2084 2018-02-10 16:39:20 $1.50  a week doesn't dona darn thing compared to the billions of giveaways to corporations who are just buying back their stocks and now they can spend as mich overseas as they want with no tax penalty whatsoever. Thanks Trump!

2086 2018-02-10 16:36:28 Think we should be buying,,Sin stocks,,
2087 2018-02-10 16:34:41 I don't give it much weight...just wanted to see what you felt about it.  I call it BS.  I'm with you...inflation is the primary driver, but I do think some of the politics is creeping into it as well.  10 Year yield still below 3%, not enough competition for stocks yet
2088 2018-02-10 16:34:05 Could you tell me exactly what do you mean by buying stocks? How does it effect the situation?
2089 2018-02-10 16:33:11 Well I’m only trading stocks, so all highly correlated. Typically 10-15 positions, so return distribution v different to index.
2090 2018-02-10 16:32:59 Like all stocks that do this, It will bounce back.
2091 2018-02-10 16:32:58 Also, there's very little institutional involvement to add stability. Thinly traded and mainly retail involvement doesn't require much to push the stocks over a cliff.
2092 2018-02-10 16:32:29 10% of Americans own 94% of stocks.
2093 2018-02-10 16:32:13 Whats The Similarities Between Arsenal Fan TV And Sunderland? Both Are The Laughing Stocks Of The Country #Fact
2094 2018-02-10 16:32:13 Prosperous? Half of all American workers earn less than $30,000 a year. 92% of all stocks are owned by the richest 20% of the country.Thousands of people got laid off across the country while Foxnews touted pitifull bonuses for a handful of workers. For fuck sake, read something.
2095 2018-02-10 16:32:03 Me: stock prices are determined by growth, ROIC, cash flows, and the discount rate. 

Also me: stocks prices are determined by the most panicked seller or most euphoric buyer at the end of the day.
2096 2018-02-10 16:31:35 Not in the court of public opinion
2097 2018-02-10 16:31:33 @StockCats So all the stocks that were"good"had been set up were DESTROYED all at once and then the Moon put things in "limbo"....
2098 2018-02-10 16:31:24 We did remove the people and stocks stream, but we are internally discussing about bringing it back so the feedback is helpful. We also have an issue with memory on tabs left open for awhile. We are looking to patch this as soon as possible too. Thanks!
2099 2018-02-10 16:31:09 Has no one told Mr Mnuchin that there is no secret to the fact that Wall St is a casino, stocks are "owned" for on average about 22 seconds, and that the public knows it? I mean, does he think we don't know?
2100 2018-02-10 16:30:45 I get that a little less than half actually own, but add in those with pensions (live gov wokers) and they indirectly own stocks. Just saying buybacks aren’t automatically bad
2101 2018-02-10 16:30:34 La frase aplica a distintos momentos, actualmente hay que ahorrar y las finanzas nos permiten mantener el poder adquisitivo  Durante mucho tiempo estuvimos consumiendo los stocks de capital, hoy hay que ahorrar para luego producir y/o invertir.
2102 2018-02-10 16:29:47 @CJStocks9 yes Stocks!!!!
2103 2018-02-10 16:29:36 The more costly housing gets, the less, I presume, the investing population trusts stocks and companies for investment.
2104 2018-02-10 16:29:36 Luckily I've moved from stocks to tokens. It is the next bitcoin or so I was told!
2105 2018-02-10 16:29:04 The question is, what stocks did Robert Mercer, the program trader behind the most successful hedge fund of our time, wish he had bought 72 days ago? Another question might be, how many people lost how many billions so Mercer could have a second chance? Asking for a friend.
2106 2018-02-10 16:29:02 Took a hit on my stocks and other shit but, it’s another day to change that
2107 2018-02-10 16:27:39 So have the stocks!

2124 2018-02-10 16:12:34 You often knock economists.  Fair to say you respect microeconomists, and disdain macroeconomists, and those who extrapolate too much from microeconomists?  Ps - crazy week of trading.  4% drop in stocks causes largest vix buying ever.  System is as fragile as ever
2125 2018-02-10 16:12:32 @TeamCavuto Neal I think Bitcoin will cut into the trading of stocks in a big way. People say it is risky. How about owning securities with SEC rules that pander to the rich. taking away the 0+ tick on short sale just rigged the system for the rich. Part of this week are shorts.

2129 2018-02-10 16:10:18 Stocks dropping by historical amounts ... Interest rates on the rise ... Inflation looming ... Wages stagnant ... There had better be a lot of jobs since many Americans will need 2 or 3 jobs to feed their kids.
2130 2018-02-10 16:09:54 Investors who thought long-term bonds were the perfect hedge against stock declines got a rude awakening this week:
Stocks = -5.1%
20-year Bonds = -1.8%
Five-year Bonds = +0.1%
One-year Bonds = +0.1%

Hmmm...
2131 2018-02-10 16:09:50 Do you regularly trade the after market trading period to buy or sell your stocks

2145 2018-02-10 16:00:11 Like I've been saying all week: there are so many stocks and sectors where momentum is still in a bullish range (14-day RSI > 30) and those are the ones we want to be buying
2146 2018-02-10 15:59:28 Same here. 0.5% risk, but capital reqd can be anywhere from 5-15% depending on how far away stop is. With stocks will result in highly concentrated portfolio. CTAs I have spoken with use a lot less than 0.5%, as trading multiple mkts and timeframes, in diversified portfolio.

2150 2018-02-10 15:57:20 Been a challenge for my portfolio this week, HOWEVER, I don't see BEARS, I see only an excellent time for value buys of good, solid stocks. #RunBullsRun!
2151 2018-02-10 15:55:56 Jeff the plunge protection team was in mkt IMO and then algos covered shorts.  If we closed again on Friday at the lows it would been a blood bath Monday w mom and pop puking stocks
2152 2018-02-10 15:55:51 Weber Master-Touch GBS Charcoal BBQ  57cm - RRP £269.00 our price £210.00  All colours available while stocks last. GBS accessories 20% off.

2155 2018-02-10 15:54:28 Stocks and bonds can both go down in volatile trading following wildest week in two years -        CRASH 'n BURN, BABY, CRASH 'n BURN .....THE COMIN' BELATED 2015 GREATEST DEPRESSION OF ALL TIME IS ALMOST HERE BECAUSE OF Y'ALL'S GREEDY "KOCH"-SUKKAS !!!!
2156 2018-02-10 15:51:41 Volatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index - commonly the higher the volatility the riskier the security #stocks #stockmarkets #DowJones #SP500

2158 2018-02-10 15:51:23 Banning bump stocks is reasonable. Something like that can be argued as a good step to take, and is entirely possible. Forget about repealing the 2nd Amendment. Its simply not a reasonable possibility. Unless you can convince 38 states to vote on repealing it, its indestructible.
2159 2018-02-10 15:50:54 i want especially if you have some stocks of bieber merch i just can't imagine if i win 14,000 worth of clothes from H&M so much desperately to get this win hoping  and believing

2161 2018-02-10 15:50:17 the media is pushing this, the fear pushes stocks lower, this translates into a perceived failure by president Trump, every thing is a catastrophe, they thrive on fear

2163 2018-02-10 15:48:19 Trump Tax Cuts is Going to shareholders

2171 2018-02-10 15:45:23 Hmm, mixing up business n general english news channel BARC ratings for a #Budget2018. Sounded more like a sports channel claiming viewership on #INDvsPAK world cup final. But then, @republic will surely add more graphics/analysis on stocks for next #BudgetDayWithArnab (1/365) 
2172 2018-02-10 15:45:17 Interesting.  I use Martha's stop setting rules, setting stops just under the first line of resistance by $.25 for stocks over $10 and $.10 for stocks under.  I keep getting taken out, then it runs higher.  Honestly, I just removed them and it goes better.  Risky.
2173 2018-02-10 15:44:58 @smw_network @business @AB401k The only reason the stock market is down is because of "computer sale offs". It's automatic when stocks fall a a certain rate..more saler's than buyer's. We are still on a Bull market up!
2174 2018-02-10 15:44:45 If Snapchat’s stocks were low before there probably non-existent now
2175 2018-02-10 15:43:45 Then if you factor in other stuff like access to EU funds like EMFF (or what follows it), ERDF funding for research - useful to answer questions associated with data deficiency on stocks of crab. Lobster, whelk, scallops etc - all of which is uncertain to be replaced = big risks

2184 2018-02-10 15:38:48 I need to pay attention to stocks more lol
2185 2018-02-10 15:38:25 @cvpayne  I am hoping you can address this question. There is been a great deal I’ll talk about oan vervalued stock market. Let’s say, “the market does become overvalued“ what does one do with one’s money? Does one stop buying stocks or do we put our money into a savings account?
2186 2018-02-10 15:38:16 You do realize that companies have a responsibility to their shareholders?  The horrors of buying back stocks!  The Couch  ‘s should learn how to invest in something of value... instead of video games& tattoos.

2190 2018-02-10 15:35:29 In your book, The Most Good You Can Do, you seem to argue choosing a high-paying job in an immoral position can do more good than an honest day laborer, if those questionable gains are donated.   Does this warrant investing in high-yielding tobacco or defense stocks?

2209 2018-02-10 15:22:58 fyi. For stocks, i do not use this game plan..i buy small positions and have hard stops and prefer LOTS of diversification, with small money in each play.
2210 2018-02-10 15:22:43 @Marketsmojo guys have you stopped giving price range for stocks which mentions   attractive, fair and  over valued price zone? @Braveant
2211 2018-02-10 15:22:10 Yeah - I could see that. I think once all the info comes in, and I clarify a stocks question, it should be ok
2212 2018-02-10 15:21:00 Definitely agree with you. #Stocks have been part of humanity since finance expanded to the global theatre. #Marriage of #cryptocurrency and #securities is natural progression.
2213 2018-02-10 15:20:56 Chris, must say though that yours is a slow moving analysis. If this were a true bear market, your system will not generate exit signals before 30% sell off has already happened (50% in individual stocks). Great work though
2214 2018-02-10 15:20:26 They all need to be investigated for what is akin to insider trading.

2224 2018-02-10 15:15:26 I hated studying in the past, but now I am enjoyable to study. Both cars, virtual currency and stocks are betrayed if they believe only things taught by others and buy it. I know it, understand it and buy it so it will go well.
2225 2018-02-10 15:14:56 Yes I use bots for targeting small cap stocks and crypto. But using a bot alone to trade will not make you money. Great TA with using bots as a tool will. I’m not against bots and if you find one that makes me work less let me know!
2226 2018-02-10 15:13:00 Certainly true with larger cap stocks with bloated balance sheets. You need to really travel down the food chain to find value, where no one has really has cared... yet.

2231 2018-02-10 15:08:31 It is. I find a lot of these types of books to be like "When investing in the stock market, only buy stocks that go up" - and this one is too, but it does have some salient points and is entertaining throughout

2241 2018-02-10 15:03:41 Look at Friday's candle across the energy sector, look at the XLE to OIL ratio, energy stocks should outperform oil from here. THey may see some weakness, but these are long term holds
2242 2018-02-10 15:01:42 Crypto miners. They're buying more high end cards than can be made, so demand is up, stocks are low = prices rise (or just don't get cheaper)
2243 2018-02-10 15:01:39 created a problem.  Folks set their low limit, and it causes stocks to sell.  People cashed in manually, which is speculated (with good evidence) to have tripped limits, creating an automated chain reaction in the market.  That's why it's gone down ~1000 on some days, and up ~600

2260 2018-02-10 14:49:36 The parabolic move in stocks was the reason prices got too far ahead of themselves. That's the reason IMO (I don't have access to read that link but I hope that's what it said).
2261 2018-02-10 14:49:12 The finish for his first was sublime. Unmarked tho 
2262 2018-02-10 14:49:11 25-year data. Correlation coefficient between the annual change in delta (10-year yield minus 1-year yield on day 1 of a year) to $DJI % price change in that year is -0.3, meaning as the delta increases stocks actually decline.
2263 2018-02-10 14:49:00 Awful mate!
2264 2018-02-10 14:48:58 When you say ‘worth’ is assets, investments, stocks & reserves included? What about the support, assistance and help we provide our members with daily? The investment in training our reps? How do you quantify all that with a number and include it?
2265 2018-02-10 14:48:08 That's different. There is nothing intrinsically bad about having an Asia specialist in HK picking small cap stocks for EU UCITS investors

2268 2018-02-10 14:45:42 And it also bothers me that an undercover FBI agent just within the past week told how the Russians had paid millions to get the Clinton's to support the Russians' goal to control American's uranium stocks.
2269 2018-02-10 14:44:49 Most people get interested in stocks when everyone else is. The time to get interested is when no one else is. You can't buy what is popular and do well.

2272 2018-02-10 14:43:35 Govts plan to run deficits ad infinitum puts into question who will buy them & at what price; rising cost of money & falling $ affects consumer. Cld stocks, Treasuries and $ fall at same time?
2273 2018-02-10 14:43:07 I've got names here like TCW trading at 18% free cash flow, theyre buying back 100M of stock because the shares are so cheap, numbers are phenomenal. Crude surplus to 5YR avg is down from 143m - ~14 million, but stocks trading like Oil is 40/bbl
2274 2018-02-10 14:42:26 Are you acepting stocks are going up again?
2275 2018-02-10 14:40:08 On last Friday, I was waiting to buy couple of stocks at bottom! But Alas! Was disappointed!
2276 2018-02-10 14:40:00 Every 2nd day there is a conference from IB/Fund house(s). So many stocks recommended. So much information avbl abt Industry/Sector/Economy/Stocks/Competitors etc.

What is missing is PATIENCE TO BUY and HOLD those even for a year.

2279 2018-02-10 14:39:05 I adapt. A person that fails to adapt loses money. No one strategy works for all stocks. My strategy varies for every investment at different times of the year, week, and sometimes day. It requires a lot more work, but I manage.

2282 2018-02-10 14:38:25 The stocks are gradually recouping but there is still more to do. Without quotas the seas around UK would be dead. Pollution is not helping but quashing the EU fisheries act will be suicide. Farage did not speak for fishermen!
2283 2018-02-10 14:38:06 Everyone knew corporations would spend most of it on stock buybacks. They were already swimming in cash & buying back their own stocks before the tax cuts. This is corporate welfare.

2288 2018-02-10 14:37:13 Stocks pastor, you seem to be right on “most of the time” ! Haha. Do you think we hit a wall at $270 and then go to lower support or possible to rally all the way to old highs?

He was brought back by Nehru in '62. FYI there's a TTK road in Chennai, named after TT Krishnamachari.

Really, what is going on?
2332 2018-02-10 14:06:16 Would you still like stocks is certificates of deposit yielded 20%?
2333 2018-02-10 14:05:59 I live 20 minutes from a Hasbro distribution centre and our stocks everywhere are so random (Asda currently selling wave 1 TM heads), if at all, unless it’s RID, we‘re drowning in RID. I did randomly find Quake & Topspin in Tesco where we haven’t had any TM since wave one.

2336 2018-02-10 14:02:51 love your work   but respectfully disagree with 4.8k this time because i think the overall market sentiment is very positive at the moment.  also stocks are crashing which is good for crypto as well.
2337 2018-02-10 14:02:34 Sir, some experts r saying further correction is going to come don't buy even 10-15% of stocks for long term. Then What shall we do? Shall we start it now or.......... 
2338 2018-02-10 14:01:14 Got it.  I’m a bit literal. Dan, the fact remains that crypto is in its infancy.  And while much of the price is due to speculation, so is the valuation of stocks.  Businesses are merely testing the waters, my friend. The current valuation is fair/steal to potential IMO.

2345 2018-02-10 13:53:14 Actually, it is a clause. It has not always been adhered to exactly, but mostly it has - by choice. When politicians have chosen not to follow it, they have not landed in jail- ever (see price & his stocks, etc). We don’t treat it as a law -  we should of course.
2346 2018-02-10 13:49:44 "Everything is online" so they cut reference/info staff & downgrade and/or scrap specialist collections/reserve stocks & invest in online resources which they then cut, a disgracefully short-sighted race to the bottom which severely restricts free access to info/law/knowledge.

2425 2018-02-10 12:27:15 Totally untrue. The book features on the EB Recommends promotion, and all branches ordered stock which was prominently displayed. EB took 50% of all SA's stock. Sales spiked after Tembeka was interviewed by Eusebius this week, leading to some out-of-stocks until the next delivery
2426 2018-02-10 12:26:33 Why?  His economic (tax) policies created the environment for the market to succeed.  He, however, did not execute the sales of stocks to create the tumble.  Those who did execute also took all the credit for the build up.

2454 2018-02-10 11:48:31 That’s fair. But most stuff would be quite correlated to beta. Unless you’re doing something like indexing + long options on specific stocks or some risk/merger arb. The latter is more prone to blowing up.

2458 2018-02-10 11:45:59 I'd want to keep protections for workers, fisheries rules that have begun to increase fish stocks, environmental protections, a body that's big enough to take on Apple and Google, etc.
2459 2018-02-10 11:44:18 Yeah I am not advocating putting all your investable worth on 3 stocks - there are people who do that though see microcap club. Just saying if you are going to play the stock picking game with some of your money, make sure it’s uncorrelated to beta as much as possible.
2460 2018-02-10 11:44:02 Hello Mr Piyush, should I buy mid cap or large cap stocks in current market scenario. My time horizon is 1 year.
2461 2018-02-10 11:43:14 Entirely at the #Eu doorstep they bribed our industry early 70s for access,gave loads of cash for Scots to build up the fleet...with no thought of fleet build up on stocks + #EU fleet...collapse came n blame the fishers!!!!

2466 2018-02-10 11:39:15 Too bad you didn't get a picture so we could of publicly shamed them.  It is too bad the stocks are not around still.  I don't even commute anymore and this pissed me off.
2467 2018-02-10 11:39:02 There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks. 131
2468 2018-02-10 11:38:25 Lots of one time spending. Roads rebuilding Houston Puerto Rico opioids that is a big chunk of the spending-needed to cut shrimp on a treadmill crap
2469 2018-02-10 11:38:09 Same is applicable for rest pharma stocks which are down 50% from highs.

2471 2018-02-10 11:36:17 Another factor is that in order to buy all the stocks included, for example, in CFIT coin (FAANG: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Alphabet you would need to do several trades, pay commission on each trade and pay for the full shares, which are quite expensive. #ico #Cryptf

2479 2018-02-10 11:28:15 To be fair, what I am saying must be understood in a larger context. Say you index with %80 of your money allocated for risky assets. With the remaining %20, you buy 3 stocks equally weighted. My comment doesn’t apply to professional managers who can’t deviate from indices. 
2480 2018-02-10 11:27:30 They're stocks have been exponentially rising, what are you talking about lol!? Please give evidence that those 500k were bought, so far you have been unable to give me any evidence to back up any of your points, it's been really embarrassing!

2482 2018-02-10 11:26:04 It appears their is a very large short on the VIX (volitility) over 1 trillion by the same group who messed up in 2008 with derivatives.  They are being forced to sell stocks and cryptos (whatever they have) to keep the short active.  WS is unsure what will happen here.
2483 2018-02-10 11:25:56 When interest rates are close to zero the the possible returns from everything from bonds to real estate have declined. Therefore the discount rate should be reduced too. This increases the values of stocks dramatically and they trade at high valuations to the historical levels.
2484 2018-02-10 11:23:42 I used to be 50% cash, but the stocks are up so much that I am like 25% cash now without doing anything.
2485 2018-02-10 11:22:23 I already explained it? They calculate the album sales differently, THERE ARE GAPS WITH EVERY ARTIST, HOW DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND THAT.

Of course SM's stocks rose more than Bighit, SM have multiple groups, actors, etc. All Bighit have is BTS. BTS brought more money in than EXO tho
2486 2018-02-10 11:18:52 Please Remoaners don't use protection of the environment, animal cruelty, the CAP, the CFP as examples of why we should stay IN the EU. All have been a total failure. The CFP has destroyed fish stocks and our coastal communities.

2489 2018-02-10 11:14:47 insane isn't it? I think it can only be explained that money is being created (like quantitative easing) and funneled into investments; the supply of investment money is so large; the money must go somewhere, it forces stock prices up; people put faith in the big stocks;
2490 2018-02-10 11:13:06 You mean the English fishing industry that was on its knees in the early 1970s through over fishing of fish stocks almost causing a war with Iceland and farmers who for decades have struggled in the UK? All the employment figures have done is prove that UKIP lies are just that
2491 2018-02-10 11:08:27 The English? I think a lot of us English would like to see him locked in stocks and pelted with rancid tomatoes... at the very least.

2495 2018-02-10 11:02:39 Eh, kinda, its actually stocks going down that makes bonds more worth it. The bigger problem is the amount of lending money out there shrinks due to the gov taking the loanable money for its bill useage instead. Creates shortages and tighter lending ability for banks

2503 2018-02-10 10:57:32 can’t imagine shorting stocks when USD falls rapidly would work. But maybe if it was liquidity-driven...but then US financial condition indicators are still very loose.

2504 2018-02-10 10:52:50 I'll buy and short stocks, even run some complex option strategies. There's always a real company tied to the trade.  The volume in these $VIX trades is troubling.

2541 2018-02-10 10:19:08 Was too scary to hold $UVXY short over weekend, been only one week since I reopened my Stocks account.

Alto, it seems logical that it will drop on monday session.
Just didn't want to risk my portfoli in case it goes nuts.

2544 2018-02-10 10:15:59 with due respect, all indicators dont work on all stocks.
2545 2018-02-10 10:15:25 Also, isn't the rise and fall of stocks one means of money laundering if done right and in...... cooperation?

2547 2018-02-10 10:14:00 It could be a big loss in company's stocks after failure of AKKOR, a defense system against ATM which is developed by ASELSAN after terrorists attacked a Leopard2 by one of new generation missiles and destroyed it in Syria. That wasn't declared tank was equipped with AKKOR or not

I am a big fan of you.I am still in profits even in this  bloodbath all thanks to you.Can you share your views on these stocks keeping the view of 2-3 years?  Sanwaria, V-Guard, Exide, V2 Retail, MOIL, Urja Global, Meghmani Organics, VIP.
2555 2018-02-10 10:03:26 Indeed. Too much focus on FTSE as a barometer of the nation's 'wealth' and economic health... It's only very indicative to the former and is forward looking on the latter.

2563 2018-02-10 09:51:47 2/ The govt. spending stimulated the economy. 3. Low interest rates stimulated the econ. 4. The people the Fed bought the bonds from then had cash they had to invest elsewhere. They bought stocks. Wealth effect. GDP growth. QE made all the difference. QT will too, in a bad way.
2564 2018-02-10 09:51:27 Hey @amazonprimenow I don’t know about the rest of the world but here in France it’s 40€ minimum to get free delivery (I’m already prime member).

2566 2018-02-10 09:48:33 have a school friend who ha been ranting on LTCG for a week. somebody asked him, how much he has invested in stocks.... he said: I only invest in property!!!!
2567 2018-02-10 09:47:36 You already have a #worldhaircare category online so you know what products you should have to meet the needs of your customers. You now need to ensure that every superstore stocks some of these #tesco #blackhair
2568 2018-02-10 09:46:55 In a perfect world we'd have a big dollar and tsry rally starting now with Kuroda reappointment and falling stocks. Maybe. That wld be helpful.
2569 2018-02-10 09:46:21 Trump: further sanctions on Russians not enacted; Dem memo blocked; defending (yet another) alleged sex offender and stocks tumble. Whilst I hope 'Agent Orange'  is imploding it could just be that he's the 'Teflon Don'...
2570 2018-02-10 09:45:15 Stock brokers and traders already pay 15% short term capital gain. LTCG is accrued when investoers hold stocks for long time.0 tax encourages people to hold for long time..having said 10% tax on a 15% gain reduces it by 1.5%. Other assets cannot give more than 7-8% returns.

وبعضها على العكس تماماً، يتحدث عن إنفجار فقاعتها إنفجاراً صاروخياً للأسفل

2629 2018-02-10 08:33:35 كما ان هناك أمر علينا أن ننتبه له
كل دورة اقتصادية تنتهي خلال خمس الى عشر سنوات كحد اقصى 
والدورات عادة ما تنتهي بركود او إنهيار جزئي أو كلي 
وقد مضى على الأزمة المالية الأخيرة عشر سنوات تقريباً
اخر انهيارين اقتصادين كانا في عامي 
1998
2008
وهذا سبب من أسباب أطلاقهم للتحذيرات
2630 2018-02-10 08:33:23 So does FTSE TR. But of course does not take account of charges. so gives a falsely rosy picture.
2631 2018-02-10 08:32:20 The stock market is picking up the volatility of the crypto market, this week. Next month, Dow will fluctuate 20% within a session like crypto alts. #stocks #dow #nasdaq #BTC #Cryptocurrency #blockchain
2632 2018-02-10 08:30:17 يذكرني ردك برد مشابه على موضوع كتبته في احد المنتديات باسم "الإنهيار" وكان هذا في عام 2006
بناءً على الفريمات الكبيرة كانت هناك مؤشرات لإنهيار قادم للأسواق المالية
ليس مؤكدة بكل تأكيد لكنها مؤشرات تدعو للمراقبة ورفع درجة الحذر
2633 2018-02-10 08:29:48 The ftse100 has it, if you reinvest dividends. Dow IA includes dividends in its measure, which is why it typically hits all time highs when the FTSE appears to lag behind.
2634 2018-02-10 08:28:30 ممكن يكون توقع خاطئ 
لكن "كذب"!
ربما تكون توقعاتنا المخالفة لتوقعاتهم غير صحيحة وبالتالي وبمنطقك يجوز تسميتها ب "الكذب"

هناك امكانيات بسيطة لتقليصها فقط
ولو كان بالامكان تجنبها لما تعب احد ولما اشتكى احد

حركة الاسعار لدينا مرتبطة بمزاج وسيطرة وليس اداء ومواسم
انت بنفسك قلتها، موسم توزيعات وهو افضل مواسم الاسهم تتراجع فيه الاسعار
2643 2018-02-10 08:21:54 I had it before were I bulldozed more than half the stocks in play with a hyper buffed solo ganon and then died in a bomb explosion, I ended up wining cause there was not enough stocks left to top my score
2644 2018-02-10 08:20:30 The only reason there are any fish stocks left of because of EU policy - there will not be a UK fishing industry worth the name in 10 years if we leave the EU!
2645 2018-02-10 08:18:43 الخطا هنا في الربط بين اسواقنا وبين الاسواق الامريكية. نصل الى مكان تدخل سيولة انتقائية. ذكية لاقتناص الفرص والشراء على أسعار بخسة جدا. اذا النزول من 3500 الى 3300 في موسم التوزيعات ليست بالبسيطة. التريث والايجابية والدخول المنظم كلها اساسيات لتجنب المخاطر

2650 2018-02-10 08:14:02 Exactly what I'm waiting for. After that a new and bigger cycle starts. People need to understand that this is completely normal, like the cycle of stocks, housing etc. We need to shake off weak hands and introduce our crypto to new investors.

2661 2018-02-10 08:01:22 Stocks and bonds can both go down in volatile trading following wildest week in two years - CNBC
2662 2018-02-10 07:57:50 @ErikFossing do European stocks look cheap at these levels given the underlying macro fundamentals?
2663 2018-02-10 07:57:23 Idk enough bout that. That shit like stocks to me. I need someone to sit down, smoke one, & explain to me how these things work.
2664 2018-02-10 07:53:06 Who said anything about the CFP? Do you think UK fishermen will be free to fish in other countries’ waters? Do you think the UK government is going to let national stocks be devastated by overfishing?
2665 2018-02-10 07:51:44 Actually, right now my stocks are doing pretty bad. However, gaining a huge boom in the stock market just means it's going to have to adjust itself or pop. Rapid stock market gain is both a great and terrifying thing for anyone in stocks.
2666 2018-02-10 07:51:11 I think Koreans feeling positive. Americans too. Pull cash out of stocks and put it where to escape inflation???? Gold? Or that other place???crypto!
2667 2018-02-10 07:49:32 In times gone by #CTA's didn't trade individual equities, now some of them don't even trade commodities! >AUM i.e.; management fees are attractive, but at the same time forces them into more liquid markets i.e.; stocks due to scalablity and that´s where correlation risk lives
2668 2018-02-10 07:48:30 well just see the future. meanwhile i’m going to invest in their stocks while things get shaky in their market 
2669 2018-02-10 07:47:32 I really need to get me some amazon and apple stocks
2670 2018-02-10 07:45:14 How is that fair comparison? Do startups collect electricity? Do you go around and buy stocks with electricity? Do startups store electricity in their batteries? Do u buy collectables with electricity? In crypto startup=ICO, ERC20=stock, collectables is cryptokit. Please explain.
2671 2018-02-10 07:45:03 Wow, It takes our Congress 2.6 years to rack up those kinds of losses. Good work stocks!
2672 2018-02-10 07:44:53 And by the way, the CFP isn't perfect but it's starting to pay off in terms of the recovery of fish stocks, which the UK can't manage on its own because oddly enough fish move around.
2673 2018-02-10 07:44:13 Imagine owning Snapchat stocks, anticipating your money growing and then boom, they drop this shitty update.

2688 2018-02-10 07:29:22 Agree. Whole point about investing is find misunderstood stocks or gems in other ways. In last week’s sell off $SELB did not drop as much as others. It reminds me of $AUPH at $1.80 after its trial results were misinterpreted.
2689 2018-02-10 07:25:19 It will be better off for about two years then over fishing and depleted stocks will decimate the industry. Fishing quotas weren't designed to hamper the British, they were to protect fishing stock.

2715 2018-02-10 06:57:29 Just as it would be foolish to focus unduly on short-term prospects when acquiring an entire company, we think it equally unsound to become mesmerized by prospective near term earnings or recent trends in earnings when purchasing small pieces of a company; i.e., common stocks.

2732 2018-02-10 06:41:36 @iancassel - It’s hard to be a longterm investor when you watch your stocks every sec. If you want to be a better investor, get rid of all distractions that promote short-term thinking. Turn off the TV and pick up a book and learn something that is additive to yr longterm success
2733 2018-02-10 06:41:18 If you are or have been freaking about the #StockMarket the last few days then you might be a bit immature to be #investing. This is not an irregular thing and considering the insane run up we had this is just a simple correction. So #buynow and cash in later. #stocks

2765 2018-02-10 05:55:19 you can have insider trading for different bitcoin stocks but as soon as you are not trading bitcoin related stocks(stocks that have nothing to do with bitcoins, especially tech stocks) i think that is when you will end up like the wolf of wall street lol
2766 2018-02-10 05:54:54 Since 9k will fail due to lack of buying volume and big sell walls, we'll go down either to 7k or retest low at 6k (strong resistance).

I don't see it going down to 5k without a negative catalyst. Money flowing out of stocks has to flow somewhere...why not into cheap crypto

2792 2018-02-10 05:24:33 Then again it’s the same crowd that will win an argument about tax cuts and the surging stock market by saying “It doesn’t affect me! I don’t have a job or own stocks!”
2793 2018-02-10 05:23:21 I don’t own a team
2794 2018-02-10 05:20:33 So are you referring to stock  market chart trends? I really cannot see how stock market trends would be anything like crypto trends. 
Stocks and cryptos are so different in so many ways.
2795 2018-02-10 05:18:37 Anyone noticed the sincronicity between stocks down & #cryptos up? The Big money is moving, something seems to be coming maybe debt has something to do with it. Just maybe.

2803 2018-02-10 05:09:57 $hpnn reminds me of a few other stocks that I have traded in the past. It starts with great volume in the trips. It then calms down to tiny volume like everyone has lost interest. Then all of the sudden some great news is dropped and everyone jumps in driving it up. I’m holding!

2810 2018-02-10 05:04:01 Awesome show and thanks Josh for sharing your candid views on the market. January melt-up nonsensical talking heads are hiding nowadays.  I also employ the low-ball GTC orders on stocks that I have missed. Luckily, this week got CELG, AAPL, XOM and GOOGL.
2811 2018-02-10 05:03:26 Saw theory posed that Dow dropped b/c traders had to cover their BTC futures which they assumed would continue to rise. They surmise that stocks actually followed BTC drop, not other way round.
2812 2018-02-10 05:01:29 I was betting on some stocks at the marketing (try with that)

2837 2018-02-10 04:44:02 Did you notice stocks/indices have started to behave like how bitcoin did a few weeks ago? Or just my perception?
2838 2018-02-10 04:43:51 The DJIA performance since 1900 is irrelevant if you own stocks with a basis from 1998.
2839 2018-02-10 04:43:18 Really feeling like the mainstream is missing what is really happening on Wall Street. Stocks and dollar on the verge of collapse.
2840 2018-02-10 04:40:55 @realDonaldTrump, @IvankaTrump, @DonaldJTrumpJr, you all love to talk about the stock market when it goes up. How much should Trump be blamed for stocks heading “for their worst week since the 2008 financial crisis”?
2841 2018-02-10 04:40:30 Snapchat stocks are up 5% this week and I guarantee it’s not because of this new god damn update.
2842 2018-02-10 04:40:19 Pay off my wife and my student loans (500k) then use half of the rest towards a house. The other half would be invested in stocks and my kiddos college fund.

2849 2018-02-10 04:38:14 @aevanko is there anything later in the game to boost item creation chances?

playing as a bow main and the 1:1 conversions for coatings/ammo really puts a serious dent in your stocks both in the field and item box/farm
2850 2018-02-10 04:38:12 I'm just getting into myself. I sold some of my stocks before it went down for some profit. My novice advise don't sell low. Be greedy when others are fearful.
2851 2018-02-10 04:37:59 David. Research stocks and Indictments. You're misinformed.

Not Sealed "Indictments"

Cases.

Not abnormal at all for thousands of cases to be sealed. Kids. Patents. Intellectual Property...

Bonds=US Debt.

2854 2018-02-10 04:34:57 #Trump has ALREADY DOUBLED the deficit.  The joke's on the people who piled into stocks and bonds after #Trump bragged about it.  Now their getting clobbered.  The same fools he stayed out of the market from '09 on because Obama was President.

2856 2018-02-10 04:31:50 Promoter buying in the last 2 yrs should not be considered as a metric for evaluating such non established names ..they may also have believed in good times in future for stocks and what better way to invest in your own baby ...else why didn’t they invest in 2016 or prior
2857 2018-02-10 04:31:19 It’s hard to be a long-term investor when you watch your stocks every second. If you want to be a better investor, get rid of all distractions that promote short-term thinking. Turn off the TV and pick up a book and learn something that is additive to your long-term success.
2858 2018-02-10 04:30:21 5th in sm4sh and melee. Really happy with my performance in S4 but just a few flubs ended up costing me a lot of early stocks/reads. Glad I got a real bracket tho after missing BP so many times. GGs all 
2859 2018-02-10 04:29:49 I haven’t spent much time researching what I can do as far as getting my new IRA in the market, but I am kind of intrigued with energy stocks right now and where Dominion may go

I hear some chatter that doge > bitcoin because it has more real world potential

2861 2018-02-10 04:27:50 You should do it! Robinhood is making it so easy to invest & diversify in not only stocks, but also digital assets. This is a total game changer & living in MO gives you the first opportunity to utilize that ability!
2862 2018-02-10 04:27:06 Nationalized banks are getting a new start after this SBI clean up. Banking system is moving towards clean banking. Meanwhile don't jump your guns to buying mode. Still lot of clean up is needed. Don't buy low value/double digit banking stocks without thorough analysis.

2864 2018-02-10 04:24:55 Besides #crypto , what else are you guys invested in? I, myself, have been stacking up pretty hard on silver. Physical silver, much more satisfying to my 5 senses than silver stocks. Lol. & Easier to HODL :D #btc #bitcoin #silver #palladium #diversify #WhatsInYourPortfolio
2865 2018-02-10 04:24:25 i got it at $129! UP $199  they’re having a sale @ Henderson building, while stocks last~

2867 2018-02-10 04:22:51 are we talking stocks or crypto
2868 2018-02-10 04:20:12 Apart from crypto this so called "healthy correction " has spread in all other asset classes and commodities unlike the past ,in this phase correction is sharing high levels of correlation with stocks and bonds.
2869 2018-02-10 04:20:00 "Stocks are definitely fun.  You should get into it."
2870 2018-02-10 04:17:59 Just like you ridiculed trump for claiming responsibility when the stocks went up , why don’t you equally absolve him of guilt now that it’s correcting.

What will you say when it goes up again
2871 2018-02-10 04:17:41 What closed the deal for me with him was the “look at the dow, 666 points loss” shit. You need to manipulate  stocks of 30 companies (apple,coke,walmart...+) to pull that stunt. 
I’m now more interested in the swarm intelligence he is drawing, can be usefull.
2872 2018-02-10 04:17:41 Trade CSE stocks under a buck for 100k or more shares and then oh boy, you will feel the ECN fees of .0012/sh and ya all service providers are having tech issues currently.

I'm not overly concerned what the market is going to do but I'm most active when the market is crap.

If you get on the right tram sooner or later your turn comes
2876 2018-02-10 04:14:08 Master president ....If you want stock go up ,can you make news very bad ;so you can see all stocks go up ;this is look for you
2877 2018-02-10 04:11:21 This pretty much made my day. Go @wnbachicagosky & @bigmamastef!!!

2879 2018-02-10 04:08:32 You're just mad you only have two stocks to camp with. xD
2880 2018-02-10 04:08:05 Definitely. Patience pays off. Blows my mind to see young people leveraging credit cards to try to profit quickly off stocks/bitcoin. So stupid.
2881 2018-02-10 04:07:43 Oh, the market is efficient enough. But stocks and the secondary market have no relationship to the health of the economy. A stock purchase isn't a vote of confidence in a company like it used to be; it's trendsurfing.
2882 2018-02-10 04:07:06 For now, my stocks are mostly from, stock advisor recommended..mostly all weather stocks..

$INPX
$WAIR
$PIRS
$MOBL

I'll be trading with about $5K-$7K in 2019, so I'm getting realistic and not paper trading any stocks greater than $10.
2884 2018-02-10 04:03:59 I have two account:
Account 1-has 8 stocks and I didn't touch throughout the craziness of the last few days.                                         Account 2- I traded.  
Results:
Account 1-lost 3% 
Account 2- lost 15%
Lesson learned.
2885 2018-02-10 04:03:55 US market is correcting itself same like ours. Stocks were Over valued  and hence a correction is must for healthy uptrend. It will consolidate around 10500 i think for next month or so. Then we will never see that number again in our life.
2886 2018-02-10 04:03:46 I accept Apple stocks as graduation gifts. FFR.
2887 2018-02-10 04:03:08 Within the next few years, likely 80%+ of these cryptos will be delisted from this app. They will be deemed near-worthless and trade like Pink Sheet stocks similiar to how Lehman Bros (Ticker: LEHLQ) still trades

2892 2018-02-10 04:00:54 It’s simple. We are in a housing crisis and people who don’t live, work and pay taxes in Metro Vancouver should not be allowed to buy residential real estate to flip like penny stocks & park illegal money. You don’t have to agree. It’s my non-negotiable. #vanre #bcpoli #vanpoli
2893 2018-02-10 03:58:57 Many of the albums from other KPop boy group still have many stocks of their old albums. But why BTOB doesn't : ( even 1 - 2 rare albums only, they should reprint for new melos
2894 2018-02-10 03:57:26 Jim, you have cautioned us not to fall in love with stocks ...
2895 2018-02-10 03:55:10 Wholesome stocks dropping, existential self pity stocks rising fast. Buy! Buy! Buy!
2896 2018-02-10 03:54:09 As a trader its important not to spread yourself too thin but also not to limit yourself too much either. You don't have to trade everything (i.e. stocks, options, crypto, etfs, forex etc) there is an endless amount of way to make money, that list will never stop

2900 2018-02-10 03:50:19 Cada que la tasa Tsry10 se acerca a 2.90, comienzan las ventas en stocks, y una entrada a bonos. Esto, eleva su valor nominal y la tasa comieza a bajar. Sin embargo la tasa se recupera mucho más rápido que los stocks en cada rebote, so?... what if this happen again on monday???
2901 2018-02-10 03:49:43 It's a good time to buy. The stocks are basically on sale
2902 2018-02-10 03:49:41 Stocks going down in fear of how u r representing our constitution ! Why r u building physical military? To lead Coup de te' with your "Generals"?
2903 2018-02-10 03:49:14 That's true Blueballs .

Which is why you invest in stocks with repeatable earnings/solid growth/A1 management /tight register . And when the market is terrible you load up on them.

Stocks with loose registers are the worst in a bear . The others you need to learn patience
2904 2018-02-10 03:48:42 LEARN STOCKS AND INVESTMENTS. Trust me.
2905 2018-02-10 03:48:25 Stocks rose too much and can’t do so forever is actually the best explanation in most cases
2906 2018-02-10 03:48:01 The think Jype staff's didn't order enough stocks for Woo's merchandises, since they probably didn't expect much :/

2908 2018-02-10 03:47:03 Conundrum: no single convenience store stocks enough Fifth Avenue candy bars to keep me from talking.
2909 2018-02-10 03:46:48 Now you know why people are dumping stocks from certain companies and running, and why soros put his money in a trust
2910 2018-02-10 03:45:47 This is why it’s always good to have a mixed portfolio. Bonds and stocks... this correction is necessary because the economy is doing so well. No need to fret, it will bounce back.
2911 2018-02-10 03:45:43 How about stocks trading?
2912 2018-02-10 03:45:09 hala~ buti nalang di ko tinuloy pag order ko sakanya.. Balak ko pa naman sana kumuha ng standing dolls.. mejo fishy na kasi sya una palang.. Lalaki ung seller neto diba? tapos tuloy pa din pag papaporder nya even though wala ng stocks sa korea.. Grabe dame nyang na scam T.T

2914 2018-02-10 03:43:21 It's really fun, just trying to figure out who it could be. Could be more than one company for all we know! I feel like I'm waiting to see if my Lottery Ticket is the winner, w/ all the different stocks I own.
2915 2018-02-10 03:43:21 Time to buy in! People pulling their money from stocks to invest in blockchain, cryptocurrencies. What do you think of Lexington Biosciences Inc (LXGTF)?

2919 2018-02-10 03:41:08 These factors may impact stocks in 2018

2018 POSITIVES
better earnings
DII buying
Financialization

2018 NEGATIVES
limited war with Pakistan
Political developments
GST stabilization

2920 2018-02-10 03:37:56 1: Fundmentals have no impact on short-term price
2: 1D volume is bullish but all that indicates is a short term bounce
3: Crypto has been heavily correlated with stocks recently

Not trying to sound like a jerk, I just think a lot of people are locked into this bull mentality
2921 2018-02-10 03:36:33 Lost a lot of money this week in stocks so being sick and not going out might be a gift

2930 2018-02-10 03:27:01 Stocks shot up anticipating corp tax cuts then went down after wages went up. The stock market is not the economy it’s a bookie. Buyer/Seller zero sum game. Place your bets not your faith. Fear, greed and irrational exuberance rule the day.

2933 2018-02-10 03:18:59 Trading wagers. That’s the concept. A clearing house type marketplace for wagers. Buying and selling, essentially, like stocks. I have no idea what the hell you just described.

2938 2018-02-10 03:14:15 Could only mean that stocks collapse even faster now.  Record low print on that chart from a near record all-time high in only 10 trading days and only a 10% decline?  LOL.
2939 2018-02-10 03:14:08 Yeah sure Cyclops . But I don't buy markets I buy stocks.

That's what's worked for me over a long time . That doesn't preclude evolving and changing , or changing my mind , but my base strategy is that if I really like a stock and it's cheap I buy it

2953 2018-02-10 02:58:39 Idk, maybe instead of investing in stocks and trading shares of companies, we should focus more on investing in friendship, and trading hugs.
2954 2018-02-10 02:56:47 ろですか？
2955 2018-02-10 02:55:02 for long term savings, the short term market fluctuations are nearly completely irrelevant, however in the short term you don't want to buy stocks when they are expensive, you want to buy them when they are cheap
2956 2018-02-10 02:51:40 You should forget that because non of those but the bump stocks exist.

2958 2018-02-10 02:47:27 The DOW and the S7P500 were down by 1200 points.  The first time in many years.  Stocks took a tumble.  This gives investors a chance to buy.  "Buy low sell high"  The market always seems to correct itself.  Interesting how that works! #soc249

2978 2018-02-10 02:32:34 It does go up and down, and never in a straight line. This time I hear it was caused by large hedge funds betting on margin there would continue to be low volatility. They lost big, and had to sell stocks to cover their losses.

Or even stocks.

3041 2018-02-10 01:43:27 Back to your question, the economy has been improving solidly since 2010 Under Obama.  It didnt start to improve under Trump, its continuing from Obama.  Stocks hit lowest under Obama at 6500 ended at 19000 under him.  Trump inherited a booming economy

3046 2018-02-10 01:39:47 yes. they have created a miracle with their stocks. CBs will do it with imp. vols. inflation fears is a joke (misunderstanding)... nothing has changed...
3047 2018-02-10 01:39:24 Well fuck. We've already lost close to 20k in one of our stocks. :/
3048 2018-02-10 01:37:07 You're a millennial, you should be buying crypto. Stocks are for old people!

3050 2018-02-10 01:36:23 gago sarap niyon may stocks na pala kayo
3051 2018-02-10 01:35:57 Wow. @themotleyfool is the most contradicting news source for stocks on the planet.  It’s funny to watch them post one thing about a stock and then say the opposite thing a couple hours later.  Wow. SMH
3052 2018-02-10 01:35:26 I’m not bro I invest in actual stocks not bitcoin 
3053 2018-02-10 01:34:36 Anyone who sold off their bitcoin when it dropped is a moron. Anyone who sells off their stocks because the market is dipping is a moron. Anyone who sells anything is a moron. I’m a hoarder.
3054 2018-02-10 01:34:26 So much for little kids putting dollar bills into their piggy banks. Let me guess: This clown wants to tax the paper money used by working-class people, but probably doesn't want to tax rich people's long-held stocks and bonds. Right?
3055 2018-02-10 01:33:29 Cost of machines? Cost of business? Staff? After expenses they don’t make anything. That’s why crypto stocks are getting smashed. Price is truth man.
3056 2018-02-10 01:32:19 Cause I didnt realize it worked like stocks, in that it gain value with popularity, its getting way more popular so seem like it should be getting more valuable soon, lol, idrk how it all works but I understand that much #bitcoin
3057 2018-02-10 01:32:15 Stocks are down, gas prices are rising and you are running a White House of shenanigans.  Unqualified people are working in the White House that the American people are paying for..undeserved.
3058 2018-02-10 01:32:15 My accounting teacher worked for a firm where they trade stocks and only hold them for milliseconds using an algorithm and the company makes millions
3059 2018-02-10 01:31:56 For now if usd holds or continues to retrace up I can see stocks go up will bonds drift flat to lower.  Think it’s as much the usd as it is bonds
3060 2018-02-10 01:31:16 My point of view is (1) many stocks are down and (2) it is counterintuitive to think that the CEO of a company would like the market price of a stock (i.e. it’s a tracking stock btw) to go down.
3061 2018-02-10 01:30:39 I will after I have the stocks down I’m not there yet but I’m getting closer now I’m really thinking about starting a LLC
3062 2018-02-10 01:29:54 Oh totally true! Hasn't even thought of journalism here. Great example is the Cas9 immunogenicity preprint that sent CRISPR company stocks crashing.
3063 2018-02-10 01:29:28 Of course rich people own more stocks than the average person. They have more money this makes sense. So what?
3064 2018-02-10 01:27:28 Do I get nuts? I don’t know shitabout stocks
3065 2018-02-10 01:27:21 ETFs are good for hedging a sector. Say you have 3 energy stocks and 2/3 are not performing while crude is moving higher, you buy a low fee/comms energy ETF. That's how I would use an ETF. A financial adviser will walk you through more detail.
3066 2018-02-10 01:27:14 adding up stocks : )
SLOWLY~
3067 2018-02-10 01:25:35 Anybody trying to get some free stocks?
3068 2018-02-10 01:22:07 Is there anyone on my TL well versed in investing/stocks/etc? I have been reading up on stuff but I learn better from discussions than readings lol
3069 2018-02-10 01:19:31 I have been in crypto 4mo. but learned a lot. I held some good performing stocks over the last year, but my buddy wouldn't shut up about day trading nav coin. tried that and got rekt. wish I knew about all these cool Twitter guys back then, but here we are!

3071 2018-02-10 01:18:54 I would do it as a one-time favor as this isn't the focus of my service. How many stocks are we talking about?
3072 2018-02-10 01:18:39 Interactive Brokers is the best for stocks hands down. Extremely cheap and reliable. Can also do futures with them. Thing about decentralized exchanges is the liquidity. To me the spread in % is part of cost of doing biz, as half the times I use market or stop orders to enter.
3073 2018-02-10 01:18:36 Today whom'st'd comb a   stocks . :) 
3074 2018-02-10 01:17:39 You are ensuring the stock market continues to dive with statements like this. Where is your explanation? You said stocks were all about you when there was a small rally. Changing your tune now they are in the toilet?

3081 2018-02-10 01:11:07 Stocks: I may have to read Barron’s this weekend to listen to the gurus “stocksplain” the volatility.  Should be fun. $SPX $NDX
3082 2018-02-10 01:10:24 For futures, fees are 0.008% of  notional for a round trip trade, and spreads are 0.001%. Tax treatment is also better.  Stocks 0.005$ a share! In fact I find crypto a rip-off, the volatility over compensates, yet exchanges are ripping all of us off.
3083 2018-02-10 01:09:58 Stocks: You are taking a risk if you use market orders with volatility moving this thing up and down and all around every minute! $SPX $NDX
3084 2018-02-10 01:08:53 Stocks:  you blink and the market moves 200 points.  I literally had a limit order that made sense when I entered it, then looked like a long shot, then got filled - within two minutes. $SPX $NDX
3085 2018-02-10 01:08:18 Sell those stocks and buy some Bitcoin

3087 2018-02-10 01:06:27 @USProgressives How about a 3 year financial transaction tax of 0.3 % on stocks, 0.1 % on bonds to finance infrastructure, including reasonable fencing and border entry stations to get @realDonaldTrump support.

3088 2018-02-10 01:06:01 Shock kept talking about those Stocks for a reason. I’m looking into them this weekend
3089 2018-02-10 01:06:00 Holy shit, you will need money in an account to buy stocks?
3090 2018-02-10 01:05:20 Hey, Raza. We got your inquiry. Due to an overwhelming response to the promotion as early as the first week. The promo code was valid for in-stock products. We admire your interest in our products. We’ll have stocks again by next month. Feel free to check our website for updates.
3091 2018-02-10 01:05:09 #Stocks: More volatility in the week ahead as #equities #market continues to  war with the #bond market over rising #interestrates. #SNP500 & #Dow lost 5.2 % since Jan '16, the last time the market corrected more than 10%
#Strategists: 10-year #Treasury #yield rises 3%
3092 2018-02-10 01:04:23 Most price damage has already happened in stocks.
3093 2018-02-10 01:04:16 Cheers.. I've always liked stocks but got badly burned after I bought alot of shares in banks back in 2008  Cheap for a reason lol. Your fees are alot cheaper in Crypto too! You should check out Globitex.
3094 2018-02-10 01:03:43 What? The stock market is doing exactly what it is supposed to do. Stocks go up and stocks go down according to world events and economic changes. If you’re not a gambler, put your money in precious metals or real estate, treasury bills are at 6% but a no risk investment
3095 2018-02-10 01:03:34 Better see if your neighbor tampered with it
3096 2018-02-10 01:03:33 After a roller-coaster week do you think people say "i get what i pay for"? 23B left US stocks tanking the market. But according to Lipper, only 3B was in active funds. Why? Buy an ETF, you buy everything and you can't be selective. You are at the whim of the masses.
3097 2018-02-10 01:02:35 I’m in it. Helped me out a lot this week when I was overly long in other stocks
3098 2018-02-10 01:02:22 Stock Market down again today, tragic. Bitcoin up 12% along with all other coins showing uptrend. #Stocks #Bitcoin
3099 2018-02-10 01:00:39 Western Canada select differentials are in the dump , takeaway capacity and over abundant domestic supplies is highly related to Ottawa policy . Quit blaming commodity prices for resource stock slumps when our resource stocks are highly underperforming US comparables .

3107 2018-02-10 00:56:10 @realDonaldTrump When u think about stocks this weekend, please go out and look at stars. Then u will think in the right way. It doesn't matter stocks r up or down. If u r a good man, u will always be loved. We don't need your $ to love u. We need the inspiration from your heart.
3108 2018-02-10 00:55:28 The numbers are even bleaker using closing highs, only 2 stocks in the S&P 500, $TPR and $CME , have reached a new closing high in the last 5 sessions.  I also keep tabs on 1 month lows over the last 5 sessions. 452 out of 500 stocks in the $SPX hit a new 1 month low this week.
3109 2018-02-10 00:54:37 Efficient Markets Dogma is keeping the financial press grappling with the causes of the current selloff

Price level can in fact be a causal factor contributing to a selloff of this magnitude

I see many admissions that stocks were high but none that this could be a causal factor
3110 2018-02-10 00:53:59 The $84K is all tied up in duck-patterned footie-jammy stocks
3111 2018-02-10 00:53:55 Stocks show the trend 6 months before it extends to the rest.
3112 2018-02-10 00:53:22 Stocks could see more volatility in the week ahead as the market continues to slug it out with bonds over rising…
3113 2018-02-10 00:53:14 Have an overall vision of the portfolio you want.  Any stocks, like TECK (for example)  that refuse to give ground with a 3000 point Dow drop, likely will be ok when market rebounds. Measure, test, analyze.
3114 2018-02-10 00:53:12 Data's always scarce, but my sense is the big drivers were newcomers to crypto. They were a mix of curious small money retail investors (who may or may not own stocks, commodities, etc.) and bigger money professionals (emboldened by the CME/CBOT futures play)
3115 2018-02-10 00:52:50 That is what I found 2b cute  about the rally n2  the close which pundits would say should be unlikely to occur since who wants to buy stocks over a weekend with such bi-polar moves? Don’t be surprised if the  rally late n the day will be erased on Monday & then some!
3116 2018-02-10 00:52:19 2/ ... is being papered over by blowing a ton of relatively smaller bubbles:  Student debt, securitization of auto loans, stocks & real estate.   ......
3117 2018-02-10 00:51:41 As any good business men, he will hedge both sides if he hasn't done so already. He won't lose out. Remember his investment in coal stocks 2015?
3118 2018-02-10 00:50:33 Yeah, I did say " I don't think liberals are destructive." I think liberals believe in human rights. As an independent, I voice my opinions of what I view the world than America, well, laughing stocks, sorry I got you offended. #SorryButNotSorry
3119 2018-02-10 00:50:27 The rest is waiting in the wings to buy up all stocks after the 1% finish crashing the markets
3120 2018-02-10 00:50:16 I agree that the selection was top notch. The way I look at that is even if the entries aren’t perfect, at least you’re giving yourself a fighting chance as a long term investor, while the more speculative stocks may have their survivability questioned at the worst possible time.
3121 2018-02-10 00:49:33 Many stocks are 15-20 per cent off their recent highs.
3122 2018-02-10 00:48:25 Looked at my stocks today and it did really  today.  Lol.
3123 2018-02-10 00:47:38 Money ain't a thing, I plan on playing 2k while I day trade stocks anyway for $500+ a day. Drafted or not lol. Y'all can pay me in crypto currencies for all I care.

3125 2018-02-10 00:46:46 OG I agree 20 bagger is a possibility. Usually I stay away from “story” stocks. However in this case I can see why it’s undervalued (Byrne). I can also see how it can be a disrupter
3126 2018-02-10 00:46:16 Your guess is as good as mine!. But to get the shareholders names, we first need to know the terms and conditions they are trading & selling shares on national assets, e.g. ports, mountains, minerals, plants, fish stocks etc.
3127 2018-02-10 00:44:08 @realDonaldTrump you own the worst weekly drop in stocks on Wall St. in the history of the country. Congrats! @SenatorFischer @SenSasse @JeffFortenberry #UnfitForOffice

3150 2018-02-10 00:26:08 Even if the Dow takes a whopping 20% plunge from the high, it will still be OVER a 10% annual return since the November 2017 election. 

Remember, you don’t lose or gain a dime until you sell your stocks. 

This market is not a “bursting bubble”, just a bit over-inflated.

3152 2018-02-10 00:24:50 I personally think the US stock market, Southern California housing market, and Bitcoin have all been overvalued and due a correction (Bitcoin been going through one since December, US stocks on going). I don't have a hard rule for when something becomes a 'bubble'.

3158 2018-02-10 00:21:55 Those large point drops in the Dow were stockholders winning by selling of stocks from companies that I believed could go tits up when the earth enters the afterlife & we're all in Heaven.  The point drop might have looked bad but it was a good thing.

3170 2018-02-10 00:15:59 2017 is the best comparison, in relation to economics and vehicle stock.  Demand should exceed 2017, due to economic expansion. This will be in a global market with no excess crude stocks. People are ignoring present reality, in favour of predictions.  Kinda like global warming.
3171 2018-02-10 00:15:26 If you are thinking about buying stocks, prices are now low.  This is a good time to buy if you have disposable income.  A risk possibly worth taking might be pot stocks, a growth industry!  Check out HEMP, POTN, MJNA.  These are great penny stocks on the OTC market.
3172 2018-02-10 00:15:17 @realDonaldTrump If u sink in military, just like u can't stop taking credits from stocks that u should never tweet about, I'm afraid the future won't be too good. America is still a free country. It's not a military government. If u want ppl to respect military, stop tweeting it

3174 2018-02-10 00:15:00 I’m tryna find some new stocks to invest in... 
3175 2018-02-10 00:14:55 You don’t know how the stock market works do you? The market had crashed because of housing crisis then Obama came along and propped up with bail outs and feds lowered rates and people snatched up stocks. It’s much easier to increase the market from the bottom than the top. 
3176 2018-02-10 00:14:05 I'd love to see you with your stocks down :-P #OhMatron
3177 2018-02-10 00:13:07 What are some good stocks to invest in?
3178 2018-02-10 00:13:07 Yep, I based my decision on these factors: the metals repeatedly bounced off support at 1315 and 16.15, and then, even as stocks and 10Y yields were spiking at the end of the day, both the metals and miners spiked (modestly) along with them.

3179 2018-02-10 00:12:02 US stocks finish rollercoaster session higher, Dow up 1.4%: Wall Street stocks finished a topsy-turvy session…
3180 2018-02-10 00:11:56 Hey I see me!  but I understand why their stocks went up so much recently, the other section has been turned into just advertisements
3181 2018-02-10 00:10:33 I also think it is something like that. Maybe a escape plan some restrict group of forward thinkers elaborated for when the various economy bubbles (debt, stocks, bonds) burst, to mitigate the resulting chaos. It could be some intelligence group or agency. Os just Satoshi.
3182 2018-02-10 00:10:15 You fools automatically think I'm bragging or anything. Fuck off. The market is ran by the same fat pockets that helped destroy stocks in 08. Yeah.. the bull market started under obama. He came in with historic low and all the analysis say it wasn't Obama that brought it back
3183 2018-02-10 00:09:44 Need a slap to the face - my stocks are way down :(
3184 2018-02-10 00:09:41 I’ve experience lot of issues with Questrade, last 2 weeks their level 2 was wrong for some stocks and still they’ve not fixed it, Every month or so they have these issues, and the ECN fee is insane...
3185 2018-02-10 00:09:36 Your First claimed investment is our children, but you like to prevent more children from being born. You INSIST on the right to kill babies, but how is that investing in them? Investing means expecting a return, which is more children, not more $ in planned parenthood stocks.
3186 2018-02-10 00:08:23 Worst week for stocks in 6 years, worst drop in history. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain womp womp wooooomp 
3187 2018-02-10 00:08:02 @realDonaldTrump I hope your presidency won't depends on stocks keep going up. Please reduce military influence in u and your WH. Now u see the results after u tweet too much about stocks. Military will be the same result. Be a ppl's president. U don't belong to military.
3188 2018-02-10 00:07:05 The stock market is just doing what the stock market does; correct itself after a long bull market run. While everyone is freaking out, the smart investors are making tons of money shorting stocks.
3189 2018-02-10 00:06:57 To be honest I'll just stick to those low risk stocks and shares.....
3190 2018-02-10 00:06:05 So far the huge bringing back overseas income is to buy back stocks, I almost sure it will not even impact the GDP nor W2 workers or small business

3192 2018-02-10 00:05:17 Load the boat on drone stocks
3193 2018-02-10 00:05:07 Stocks in indexes tended to get indexed up and down this week. Stocks out of indexes tended to do their own thing. The stock market is divided between those in the indexes and those out.
3194 2018-02-10 00:01:25 No doubt. Crazy 1000 point swings! Been a wild week...I'm gonna treat myself to a couple of adult beverages and forget about stocks for a couple of hours!
3195 2018-02-10 00:00:11 Glad to see stocks tumbling. Hope to see the day when stock brokers make less than scientists and engineers that actually help ppl.

3200 2018-02-09 23:56:45 from which stocks?
3201 2018-02-09 23:56:16 Bought 2 stocks today, sold the same 2 stocks.

3206 2018-02-09 23:52:48 Well turns out gold stocks weren't much of a haven. While gold eased modestly in the last couple of days, gold stocks got whacked with the other stuff, especially today.

3232 2018-02-09 23:47:30 As fundamentals would not justify such rapid movements, we can only conclude that stocks are on the skin of a speculative bubble. And no wonder, with dividends being fewer and further between.
3233 2018-02-09 23:46:27 Yoo my stocks were some shit this week smh

3238 2018-02-09 23:44:47 Here is my conundrum with this market.

There are several stocks that I have been waiting on that are now poised . Plus some LT positions that haven't budged much and are rolling out share accretive business plans this year.

I don't change my strategy because of the market .

3242 2018-02-09 23:42:32 Stocks are my favorite investment asset. But, I will never commit a portion of my personal assets that would cause me to be ruined by a short-term market collapse. I refuse to do that.
3243 2018-02-09 23:41:59 Trumpy is setting the U.S.A. for a real big fall,the decline in stocks is all his fault,as is the new lack of morals in his support teams.# we all fall down with Trump #is there no hope?
3244 2018-02-09 23:41:19 I like sunny days, but if it never snows, I don't get to ski. I also like bull mkts, but if they never correct, I can't buy stocks "on sale" #FinancialFriday

3254 2018-02-09 23:35:45 I've heard recently that the timing of the stock market drop (right after a very successful state of the union) suggests deep state may be involved by a sudden sell off to drive stocks down to hurry Trump thru quantitative easing route.

3262 2018-02-09 23:31:55 Yea they don't get it with penny stocks. They think oh you will buy 100 shares of TD, so your ECN fee will be nothing instead of 200,000 shares of IO at $.08, then those ECN fees really hit you.

3269 2018-02-09 23:27:39 U.S. government briefly shuts down, reopens. Amazon to get into the shipping business. Stocks fall into correction territory.
3270 2018-02-09 23:27:05 It’s a healthy correction. Stocks create amazing amounts of wealth, pushing inflation. After the tax cut, crude made new highs, gold touched multi years highs, dollar made new lows...
3271 2018-02-09 23:26:14 Daily Stock Update: Yesterday at this time my portfolio was worth $4.90 (after a $5 investment) today we had a nice gain and are now up to $5.01. At this rate I have to kill myself yesterday.

3274 2018-02-09 23:25:13 All these " Financial Experts " and " Stock Market Gurus " that were talking crap about #bitcoin / #Litecoin / crypto currency market bubble correcting itself and going to drop to zero have me laughing now that the same thing is happening to the #StockMarket / #stocks
3275 2018-02-09 23:25:12 Scanned many charts last night (during Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee), identified about 50 strong names setting up for my time frame, then re-scanned those (after eating some ice cream), then re-scanned those until I had about 10 stocks.
3276 2018-02-09 23:24:21 Only gotta look at the 2008/2009 movements & corrections before the proper bull run, to gain confidence & relax now.

Assuming folk are loaded in the metals & mining stocks that is :)
3277 2018-02-09 23:23:03 They could stay as bad at 0-16, just like rates could stay as low as they have been were it not for inflation creeping up. My point is you had no reason to say stocks aren’t going to keep going down and you were wrong that they didn’t keep going down. Worst week in 2 years
3278 2018-02-09 23:22:44 Except that the reason we post Is to literally facilitate said bandwagon. I get people all the time that appreciate the calls that have helped them jump into previously unknown or known stocks and make them money from indicators we see that they may not.
3279 2018-02-09 23:22:20 .@TheSpec headline: Nobody know why stocks are tanking. 

It's  because  they're  imaginary  !

3295 2018-02-09 23:08:58 Yes very bullish. One of the strongest stocks today
3296 2018-02-09 23:08:53 Not much details really. We have stocks and options chats and scanners
3297 2018-02-09 23:08:20 Sounds like better strategy than giving a tax break to corporations who use it to buy back their stocks and hoard it.

3300 2018-02-09 23:06:46 I remember the interest rates in the Reagan years. 12.5% on a discounted VA loan for our 1st home. 

I just shifted my 401K holdings into a bond-heavy fund that cuts way back on investments in stocks. I’ll leave it there until adults with brains & judgement are in charge again.
3301 2018-02-09 23:06:28 People getting out of stocks + gold + other assets and into #bitcoin, because they are tired and want some serious profits. $btc has outperformed any asset on this planet in the last 9 years.
3302 2018-02-09 23:06:26 We have *lots* of stocks, down in the dunge- the basement. Down in the basement. Where, coincidentally, your office will be. 

Lots of stocks.

Just.... lots.
3303 2018-02-09 23:06:02 Few buy-hold clients have protested a recommended rotation out of one ETF into another. But ask a client to sell down their low-basis individual stocks is akin to ripping off their badge of honor. Presuming client bought originally and ignoring taxes.
3304 2018-02-09 23:05:05 Neither does the stock market. If everyone sold their stock in GE the price would go down and there's not enough money to give everyone "their percent" of the market cap. The EXACT SAME principles apply to stocks.
3305 2018-02-09 23:04:31 Pls just make sure the decision makers in operations understand it's being received poorly - much like the lack of brand selection lately and out-of-stocks. You're repeating the mistakes from 7-8 years ago.
3306 2018-02-09 23:04:14 Unless you have been contributing to a retirement plan, been paying student loans or have some stocks that you've sold that I don't know about, you probably don't have any deductions and it will literally take you 15 minutes to do. Even on paper. 100% you can def figure it out.

3309 2018-02-09 23:01:31 According to fundamental analysis, bonds and stocks have an inverse relationship, but if examining the 30 yr / S&P 500 chart since 1980, they have a net positive correlation . So stocks and bonds in fact move together?  If in fact the 40 year uptrend in bonds is over...

3322 2018-02-09 22:56:14 Time for Canadians to get into stocks which have a a farming angle. In quick time Canada will have no resource economy & the silicon zombie economy that The Prime Twerp wants to create will just lead to human zombies who cling to their dope & iphones instead of bibles & guns.
3323 2018-02-09 22:55:44 Feels like the $VIX  Fever broke today. Not saying we will have no more whipsaw days, but the liquidity crisis has started abating. Put some good stocks in your  shopping cart and go to checkout.
3324 2018-02-09 22:55:21 I can understand why you say that. Well do you have it invested into anything? Stocks, Bonds?
3325 2018-02-09 22:55:09 Look at the past 60 days. Then the 90 before that. Stocks were unusually high. Now look at the solid stocks like amazon and Apple. If they hold steady, market is fine. If they tumble, cause for concern. It’s all gambling.
3326 2018-02-09 22:54:48 I don;t gamble. I own stocks. I can sell them if I want or hold them forever.
3327 2018-02-09 22:53:43 The more I study the markets, the more I want to spend my speculation budget on illiquid microcap stocks. (Rest can just index.) The beta of today is on steroids and what's worse, everything is correlated. What's worse is that international markets are also correlated.

3340 2018-02-09 22:45:33 $55 is the new $35 for the stocks.  Pretty crazy
3341 2018-02-09 22:45:10 it’s painful but if you hold stocks that are more valuable than current stock prices & you have LT time horizon, you’ll be ok.
3342 2018-02-09 22:44:58 @OptionsAction Given broad energy oversell, rising US production, new rigs, etc., 1) why do sand stocks get hammered, and 2) what do you do if you hold here pre-earnings (e.g., SLCA, FMSA)?
3343 2018-02-09 22:44:10 USDA-FAS @USDAForeignAg; Global #rice stocks, the majority of which are held by China, are reduced slightly this month but are still the highest since 2001

3345 2018-02-09 22:43:41 2008 was a joke. Problems weren't fixed at all,just kicked down the road. Banks bigger than ever. Deutsche biggest bank in history. European central banks & fed have screwed up royally,printing more & more money,buying stocks,each others' bonds.

3350 2018-02-09 22:41:42 $SPY A nice (tradable) bounce indeed but would I be a buyer towards the close, to hold most stocks through this weekend.  No thanks.

3353 2018-02-09 22:41:19 Cannot see decision in isolation. Sensex went up from 22000 to 35000 in 3 yrs of Modi govt. Middle class mostly gaining due to MFs & stocks. That is true wealth creation. If u get tax break but sensex goes down, middle class loses the most. Pray for good policies so stocks go up
3354 2018-02-09 22:40:36 He is losing in like all of his stocks
3355 2018-02-09 22:39:06 Once again: it's very easy to come up with a definition of "income tax" that could incorporate every kind of tax there is. What's being proposed is a tax on the sales of assets like stocks, bonds, and precious metals. You're deliberately trying to conflate it with something else.
3356 2018-02-09 22:38:49 no. oil carnage occurred step by step with indexes. on this logic oil would have to finish day in +. besides stocks rally of the last hour (strongest part of the day) is completely ignored
3357 2018-02-09 22:38:01 That’s only true for some Fang stocks. Google, and Microsoft trade at 10-15% premium to market, are growing 15-20% per year, and have large net cash on balance sheet
3358 2018-02-09 22:37:34 and they're trying to drive down stocks. They've been trying to scare people of a crash and the Fed artificially kept down interest rates under Obama, and are now threatening, for the first time in 8 years, to raise them 4 times this year

3361 2018-02-09 22:35:30 @ThomasWictor I have a theory: Stocks are so volatile bc the Saudis are selling off the assets they seized from all the guys they arrested and had to buy their freedom back...These guys have major portfolios.

3364 2018-02-09 22:34:44 My thinking is a weaker dollar will reappear, and participants will rotate to stocks perceived to offer better inflation protection. I'm not particularly bearish on economy, only the high PE / cash burn stocks.

3370 2018-02-09 22:33:33 Damn, let me go check on these stocks.
3371 2018-02-09 22:33:06 This seems like a weaker $, higher rates bet. This week, each time approached 3% on 10yr, late cyclicals sold off significantly. Message seems clear. With PMIs near 60 (growth unlikely to help stocks) if higher rates, what makes you think we get the type of risk on you expect?
3372 2018-02-09 22:33:04 Two reasons. 1 Interest rates and 2 corporations are trying to consolidate their stocks buy a quick sale until they can buy back their own stocks at a lower rate while young and new investors become scared and sell off.
3373 2018-02-09 22:31:57 Good. US govt buying stocks as fear of #cryptomarket vacuuming trillions from the stock market bubble. This is what we want. They Will fail  defending Dow.
3374 2018-02-09 22:31:19 If you own stocks you should at least always have a portion invested in $VIX as your assets reach all time highs, great way to hedge in your portfolio.
3375 2018-02-09 22:31:18 Does anyone know of photo stocks that feature people of color? I don't  want to use the same blond bearded hipster with the beard... #hiphoped #culturefix #instructionaldesign
3376 2018-02-09 22:31:11 Increased $CKHUY and $BXP to 3% and ~1.5% of single stocks near intraday lows. Also increased $PRGTX to ~2.9% of assets - ninja'd by the late-day rally with that trade. Cash is 8.4% of assets (includes a new cash deposit). Lower stock prices bring my cash target to 8.1%.

3378 2018-02-09 22:29:04 I'm pretty sure you don't know how interest rates work. You said they could go down, like its a variable that goes up and down like stocks and no one can predict it. Its very predictable, and I'm pretty sure you have no idea how the Fed adjusts interest rates
3379 2018-02-09 22:28:36 The worst is after these vol spells have passed and it’s “stocks unch on the month.”
3380 2018-02-09 22:28:33 Not sure retail investors are actually doing research.  Many are following the flavor of the month.  That said, their conviction for individual stocks should still be higher.  But I think retail is a laggard.  The algos are driving this.

3390 2018-02-09 22:25:59 IQE - I’m neither long or short  
(I don’t short in any case)

Find myself switching off from talk surrounding stocks that become the NEWS. Over 1,300 bulletin board posts on the company since 3rd Feb on ADVFN...so many experts & so many opinions.

Good luck to you both!
3391 2018-02-09 22:25:40 U.S. government briefly shuts down, reopens. Amazon to get into the shipping business. Stocks fall into correction territory.

3397 2018-02-09 22:22:40 yes usually that’s how i make money in stocks!
3398 2018-02-09 22:21:24 Lots of variables here. Much is riding on rates and inflation.  The Fed is less accommodative now than in 2014.  The economy is expanding globally now vs then. The US market was held up in 2014 by the FANG stocks. I hope the 200 day holds but this depends again on+

3400 2018-02-09 22:20:19 just made my first 200 dollars in profit in stocks
3401 2018-02-09 22:18:39 Many older investors telling me inflation is good for stocks so no worries on the near horizon. They always talk up their experience yet none of them are old enough to have witnessed the beginning of a bond bear market where rates started an uptrend. They are too complacent imo.

3404 2018-02-09 22:15:18 I’m still not sure why you guys bang on about the DOW all the time when it’s only 30 stocks.. and the weighting’s are by share price.. seems irrelevant to me.
3405 2018-02-09 22:15:03 I was beginning to wonder if we had too many trading vehicles at our disposal.  This week proved me right. Stocks and mutual funds used to be enough. I just want to buy good funds and good companies.
Not looking to gamble.
3406 2018-02-09 22:14:10 Also as interest changes, the amount of bonds vs stocks change (among other things), so when interest is up people tend to take money out of their stock investments and put them in bonds to make more profit, which affects overall stock trends.
3407 2018-02-09 22:13:46 As much as I'd like to go long TLT, and I see the game stocks and bonds are playing right now, I see a big H&S on TLT  5 year chart. Maybe a ST bounce, but that thing looks scary! We're sitting on the neck line too. Would love your thoughts on this.
3408 2018-02-09 22:13:34 It has brought crumbs to workers while stocks have fallen to historical lows. Good job!
3409 2018-02-09 22:13:22 The power of the expiration pin is absolutely incredible.  The range we had over last 2 days, and stocks can't move 50 cents AH.

Not unexpected, but truly impressive.  Also probably an indicator of the dearth of liquidity in the market right now.
3410 2018-02-09 22:13:02 Capital can be money, property, stocks or ownership - it is individuals wealth & prosperity - that is what I am speaking of.

3419 2018-02-09 22:08:12 BREAKING: Stocks stage late rally, close sharply higher but still end wild week with loss of over 5 percent.
3420 2018-02-09 22:07:24 technically, one has to admit that they've done a double bottom at the 200 day moving average; it regardless feels like 2008

(oil btw closes earlier than stocks; I'm sure you know that, you're an inflation guy)
3421 2018-02-09 22:06:34 S&P 500 at 17x forward earnings. With 3% bond yields and trillion-dollar deficits, I'll take my chances in stocks.
3422 2018-02-09 22:06:13 Always love your cookery programmes, but tonight, it didn't seem to bother you that the boat came home empty, or when you were told that it used to be so easy for locals to catch fish before the factory ships arrived to deplete stocks?
3423 2018-02-09 22:05:18 this new snapchat update (that i didn't even update--it did it on its own) is so ugly and confusing. whoever designed this really fucked up. snapchat's stocks and revenue just went up at an all time high and well, its about to go to shit

3426 2018-02-09 22:04:37 So don't buy solar stocks.
3427 2018-02-09 22:04:37 That’s a whole different / interesting theory. In this case, just curious how one can be so confident about something when the short term (inflation assets going down) and long term (stocks historical outperformance when rates rise) seem opposed to that view.
3428 2018-02-09 22:04:24 My co-workers have been confused why I've been so excited this week. My only response: "Stocks are on sale!"
3429 2018-02-09 22:04:16 @MelissaLeeCNBC Melissa love your show. Hope you can help me understand. When investment managers say a correction is healthy, do they mean it feels good to have stocks in their portfolio decline? I went mostly to cash on Jan 31 so I did experience this.
3430 2018-02-09 22:03:48 The other thing that is freaking me out is that today’s chart on the 10 yr yield looks exactly the same as the charts for the major US indices. Who switched the algos to buy stocks on yield INCREASES? Manipulation looks massive as ever.
3431 2018-02-09 22:03:28 That explains, "Mercury is closely conjunct w Ketu for a few more days. This has not been ideal recently -- so continue to be vigilant with stocks, business, communications, and health and computer viruses."

3433 2018-02-09 22:01:18 The MDC made a fatal mistake when they surnamized their party to MDC-Tsvangirai. By so doing they gave the title deeds, shares&stocks to the Tsvangirai family. At their last Congress they even made the Tsvangirai family the owners of both the Party &its Assets. #EDHASMOSTVOTES#
3434 2018-02-09 22:00:52 Short stocks is very risky.   Study very well how to short because if you are wrong you could loss a lot of money to your broker
3435 2018-02-09 22:00:51 But cryptocurrency especially TRX, and buy other stocks with high potential,
3436 2018-02-09 22:00:32 In a market that loves growth stocks backed by low growth, low inflation secular trends (technological disruption), you face a catch-22. The more you disrupt, the higher stocks should go but the lower future growth/inflation will be.
3437 2018-02-09 22:00:29 @petenajarian Pete with oil going back down would you especially be looking at consumer stocks in the sell off should be plus for market personally haven’t heard talk about it. Could it help stabilize market.... just pondering
3438 2018-02-09 22:00:27 Isn't that dictatorship? We have rights to trade ETNs & ETFs as protection. Trading stations can't change rules of game cuz they loosing. $UVXY & $VXX saved me while I was getting banged by FANG stocks. SEC is at fault not the consumer. SEC's job is to protect us. Don't be bitter
3439 2018-02-09 22:00:25 Let’s get through a retest of the old high first. As is often the case with stocks, they can go either way...and often do.

3441 2018-02-09 21:59:40 My stocks up 5% today.. 
3442 2018-02-09 21:59:15 Certain stocks you pike n use daily, you buy (i.e. Apple n Facebook) but recently with the market down, I found it easier to buy n add to DIA n SPY to capture total market moving towards tax cut n repatriation effect in few month! What do you think Leslie.??? Thx. 
3443 2018-02-09 21:58:44 Yesterday I cashed out 135 stocks. Today each stock went up $5, that's $675 more than yesterdays.  If this doesn't sum up my life, idk what does.
3444 2018-02-09 21:58:14 I’m concerned that this poor excuse to keep Govt open will be paid for in social entitlements, those entitlements that we paid into.Boomers worked and saved; and they invested in SSec., not stocks. Tax cuts for 1%? Sure thing.Balloon the deficit? Sure thing:Blame 45? Sure thing.
3445 2018-02-09 21:57:54 Stocks got the ‘Trump Bump’!!

3454 2018-02-09 21:54:50 I asked a co-worker how much longer do you have to work like this. He said 10-12 years. Then he proceeded to tell me about how good he was at trading stocks. SMFH.....
3455 2018-02-09 21:54:42 @StockMatusow  have you looked @ fprx chart and overlay it over cala chart and it's IDENTICAL since Nov? i mean eerily identical. no 2 stocks in 4 mo. have this pattern. normal?

3457 2018-02-09 21:53:50 I sense that if you want to affect a sector of stocks to your benefit just release a story how Amazon will be entering that market and boom!  Both shipping and health stocks have shown that recently
3458 2018-02-09 21:52:40 Stocks are taking a dump and im not happy about it
3459 2018-02-09 21:52:39 I am done pouring money everyday. I became shopaholic on stocks. Although I have serious FOMO the clearance sale.

Internet Monneez are fun and definitely the way of the future but precious metals are a way to ,get this, “REAL-ise” profits and establish legitimate wealth. 

Buy stocks too

Pay debts

Buy real estate. 

Just duh.
3461 2018-02-09 21:50:18 Damn thank god I never bought stocks in @snapchat, just one update and they’ve ruined all they’ve worked for, fascinating.

3463 2018-02-09 21:49:18 @FoxNews your reporting of the stock market is reckless.  Someone just suggested people should sell all their stocks.  Please stop inciting fear and panic.  Please.  I love your network but do not support this coverage.

3467 2018-02-09 21:46:57 This is an outstanding question, in my view.  For this very reason, I want all of my clients to own (at a minimum) a few individual stocks.  It gives us a basis for conversation and it's an excellent reminder that we are investing in solid co's w/ solid cash flow generation...

3471 2018-02-09 21:45:38 I get a kick watching market commentators desperately try to figure out a reason for this latest round of stock market volatility. 

The real answer is right in front of them. Stocks are down because stocks are down. Every other reason is manufactured clarity in a sea of unknown.
3472 2018-02-09 21:44:45 Robots trading stocks triggered the #Markets to historic high, that means creating the largest bubble and then they start puncturing it. Now, call it in whichever manner you like..

As a midterm offense,

Hedonistic

Acute as the weakest flashing
Of verbal envoys where the seduction has begged--

A poem should be envious
As the fulfillment of waitresses.

3491 2018-02-09 21:36:28 That's the one thing you have to love about HFT's/Algos - very predictable.   We were oversold on stochs, hit a major moving average, also happened to be near the low of the week in the futures, 85% of stocks had been below 50dma.  All fuel for at least a dead cat bounce
3492 2018-02-09 21:36:25 Bring back the stocks 
3493 2018-02-09 21:35:18 The unwinding of positions by some systematic strategies has been “so severe” that it should be nearly over, and retail investors appear to be the main risk left to stocks, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co
3494 2018-02-09 21:34:56 Of course there's a reason. Stocks have been gorging at the trough for a few years and now are taking one huge belch.

For example I randomly matched with Leffen on netplay while he was in Socal (didn't know it was him at first) and I said to myself "yeah this is obviously Leffen" 2 stocks into our first Fox ditto ROFL
3542 2018-02-09 21:19:57 Looks like the stock market is having a Black Friday sale today for long term investors. *While stocks last.
3543 2018-02-09 21:19:54 #Stocks end volatile week with a rally, #Dow up 330 to 24,191, down 5.2% for the week. Dow is now down 2% in 2018, still up 19% over past 12 months @KNX1070 @CBSLA @MottekOnMoney
3544 2018-02-09 21:19:24 It might be the worst week in stocks since Jan 2016, but it could have been worse S&P finds buyers at the 200 day MA and reverses the trend today.
It might be one of the worst weeks since 2011, but it could have been worse.
What was the catalyst for the turn around?
3545 2018-02-09 21:18:59 Rates and stocks can rise together. Will blow up conventional thinking but it has happened

3554 2018-02-09 21:17:35 "Correction" is such a weird euphemism. When stocks go up, isn't that correcting the price, too?

3679 2018-02-09 20:44:37 #stocks  this is not a healthy pullback at 500 point swings downward on the DOW within seconds. All while the 10Year Treasury refuses to drop, a sign of continuing inflato expectations.
3680 2018-02-09 20:43:35 Yes it is! That’s how Sir John Templeton picked his stocks. 5 year Forward PE.

3683 2018-02-09 20:42:54 Stocks trying to rise so fast they don't notice that yields are spiking too
3684 2018-02-09 20:42:52 good time to buy stock only short term stocks have been sold long term is fine
3685 2018-02-09 20:42:33 You also farm the fish at the same time, it allows for more sustainable sea stocks of fish whilst allowing for fresh fish to be sold locally without the food miles etc. You can go for fish like trout or tilapia or other good tasting fish whilst still getting organic veggies.
3686 2018-02-09 20:42:30 Nope and Nope. The FFed is not the elite. The dump was to eliminate BTC, it went south and they spend the money they use to keep stocks from crashing. This is in the perfect storm for $BTC to go to the moon
3687 2018-02-09 20:42:16 Is this on Indian stocks?

3699 2018-02-09 20:36:40 #stocks The trend remains to the downside and so it will be for weeks to come.
3700 2018-02-09 20:36:33 Ok! So, the market is having a first negative reaction to the fast rising in yields and inflation...but when it stabilizes, a moderate rise in yields (as long as it keeps steepening and not inverting) will actually be a positive for the long term trend in stocks, right? thanks!

3704 2018-02-09 20:35:39 @TeamCavuto So Charles @CGasparino like's to mockingly imitate Trump & sucks at it BTW. Basically he says buying stocks, unless your a Wall Street Genius is nothing but a gamble, OK fine.... so why do we need the @FoxBusiness Network?

3709 2018-02-09 20:32:18 Fascinating crosspair. Seems to indicate "risk on" still, do you agree? If so, seems to indicate "game on" in US stocks over next 12-36 months, yes. Your thoughts?
3710 2018-02-09 20:32:00 Mine too, however, the past week my stocks plummeted. Ik that counts.
3711 2018-02-09 20:31:51 On Fox Business they were talking about the computer-controlled trading by entitles who buy & sell large blocks of stocks. The effect this could have had on the market losing 2,500 points this week. Could the sell points be moved to cause this? Some people made a lot of money.
3712 2018-02-09 20:31:01 anyone holding stocks and bitcoin  over the weekend is mad.   Market could gap open 1000 down given how scared everyone is.    Nothing but negative tone in Bitcoin.

3725 2018-02-09 20:23:37 Crypto not stocks , not into that yet
3726 2018-02-09 20:23:37 I also think it s not only bitcoin but all stocks in general... ; we may see a very huge economic crysis ; if not now... till 2020 surely...
3727 2018-02-09 20:22:37 Market drop attributed to overheated economy, uncertainty about amount of new debt and intimidation by bond market.
When stocks turn uncertain bonds improve. Also interest rates are about to rise.
3728 2018-02-09 20:22:20 Stocks are going to correct this year... people will pull out and move to crypto.  Calling it now.  Already happening at Goldman Sachs.
3729 2018-02-09 20:22:08 Signed up with @RobinhoodApp today and upon approval was gifted a share of Chesapeake Energy (a oil & gas exploration/production company). Perhaps offering a sustainability preference would help avoid such ironies in the future. #stocks #oilandgas #imacleanenergguy
3730 2018-02-09 20:21:57 Yeah but give them time. People born this decade will be the generation 20 years from now renouncing the stock market while people in their 20s today will be into retirement savings via stocks.
3731 2018-02-09 20:21:48 The market is a roller coaster #stocks 
3732 2018-02-09 20:20:56 What in the world is happening? Stocks struggle as Dow eyes worst week in 9 years? Gas prices rose $00.60 since this time last year? You do a tax breaks and spend billions. No wonder 5 corporations went bankrupt and who cares about the collateral damage you in congress leave.
3733 2018-02-09 20:20:28 I only buy stocks of companies whose names show up in rap lyrics.
3734 2018-02-09 20:19:58 i feel like more people are watching $BTC than stocks right now even with stocks being crazy
3735 2018-02-09 20:19:29 *Bitcoin is also a bubble. Unfortunately with no utility value (or very little), its lifespan is limited. There are more constructive things to do with money than stocks and crypto-fever honestly. It’s a sad thing when any newcomer loses stacks of money to a volatile market.
3736 2018-02-09 20:18:54 I can tell you with a pretty good degree of certainty that my generation (late GenXers) cared a lot more about stocks than millennials do. The reasons are pretty obvious as well.
3737 2018-02-09 20:18:37 Yesterday has meditate a   stocks ?? :)
3738 2018-02-09 20:18:22 If anyone try’s to tell me the Dow and Crypto share a coupling correlation, you are highly mistaken. The only correlation they have is crypto provides an escape from fiat and stuck-in-the-mud stocks. There is no “dow is up so bitcoin is up” mentality—that’s fucking stupid
3739 2018-02-09 20:17:37 lucky they're not choosing penis sizes for this competition..
stocks and shares in penis extenders would sky-rocket
3740 2018-02-09 20:17:10 Exactly why young people hardly ever are into stocks, but in their 30s and 40s they think about retirement. Currency is not a retirement plan. Gold is not a retirement plan.

3744 2018-02-09 20:15:44 Good to see the Dow turning the corner - hope it continues. If so we should see some gradual recovery in the stocks we’re in. Any news being held back because of market conditions will start to flow in the next week or two. Bitcoin on the move up too. Hope the worst is behind us!

3746 2018-02-09 20:15:01 Also, what are the hottest stocks to invest in?
3747 2018-02-09 20:15:00 Very few twenty-somethings care about the stocks no matter which generation. In the 70s and 80s that was true as well. Stocks are a necessary way to raise capital - capitalism! Has been so for a couple hundred years before the federal reserve system. Cryptocurrency is currency.
3748 2018-02-09 20:14:29 The price of oil has fallen 10%  this week, AND the stocks are having the worst week since 2008! 
But @realDonaldTrump will claim its “fake news”

3753 2018-02-09 20:13:21 Yes; stocks are in sale for savers with a long time horizon aka 5+ years.

3755 2018-02-09 20:12:01 Paul Tudor Jones: "Treasury auctions will increase this year from the current projection of $583 billion to almost $1 trillion."The tax cut produces a higher budget deficit which means more issuance of Treasurys which means higher rates to sell the debt, pressuring stocks #stocks

3760 2018-02-09 20:09:45 Money Key: Stocks are on sale right now! Stock prices have dropped greatly in the past week, causing many to panic & sell. The best time to buy is when the masses have sold. If you’ve thought about investing in the market, now’s a good time.

3773 2018-02-09 20:06:39 This article doesn't say a whole lot.  Which is a waste because while that may be its exact point, it is wrong, there is plenty to say and know.  Question isn't why are stocks acting strange now, the answer is the question, why were they acting strange for the 3 months prior.

This week we had the biggest drop in the stock market since 2008.  2008!!! 

The Obama years are over. 
Stocks down,  inflation and debt rising.  
3779 2018-02-09 20:04:55 Which is exactly the reason not to trust it.  Some stocks have sneaky crazy spreads.

3782 2018-02-09 20:03:57 Well no, it has option value just like all other shitty company stocks
3783 2018-02-09 20:03:51 what a BIG SURPRISE ... after the wall street banks SUCKER the small investor to put the last $50 they have into overprices stocks ... THEN they take their money out & leave the SUCKERS holding the bags ... everything that goes up MUST COME DOWN ... it's physics ... google it
3784 2018-02-09 20:03:39 2) Sign up with Betterment and just automate the whole thing. You don't get to decide what stock you buy. Instead, they spread your money around the entire market through mutual funds. This is probably the more reliable option for someone who is new to stocks.
3785 2018-02-09 20:03:14 Wisdom of the Day  Traders lose money because:
* Trade too big
* Trade without an edge, or in other words — gamble
* Over trade
* Trade low price junk stocks
* Use excessive leverage

3789 2018-02-09 20:02:14 Love that !!!
3790 2018-02-09 20:02:00 It does in part have to do with Trump. The tax cuts pushed the volatility. We were set for ups and downs but not significant volatility. Tax cuts, wages, etc are placing the fed into a position to raise interest rates which is pushing a sell off of stocks to get into bonds.
3791 2018-02-09 20:01:53 I would say it's notable how quiet stocks have been since 2pm

3795 2018-02-09 20:01:21 Personally, I see two solid approaches to investing that have worked for me.

3800 2018-02-09 19:59:59 I guess there might be some kind of a roller coaster ride ahead. I'm not a day trader, so probably will hold most of my stocks and wait. Unfortunately I need some of working capital for one Estonian/Finnish, and one Dutch start-up. Hard to hold on with all my current stocks.
3801 2018-02-09 19:59:59 Well....

A good starting point is just understanding what it is not...

A) Stocks should not be seen as a get rich opportnity.
B) Stocks should not be seen as a huge risk.
3802 2018-02-09 19:59:34 Yep just saw that Nite moved right away
3803 2018-02-09 19:59:26 @FresnoBee Please writes about how laccid the GOP is about fixing the problem with Nunes. He is now going after State looking for how the Mueller invest got started. Wasting tax $s. Making laughing stocks Congress, committees, his own beginnings.
3804 2018-02-09 19:59:20 I simply followed the advice of our great president that it was a "big mistake" to sell stocks.
3805 2018-02-09 19:59:12 Depends who you ask!  The year will bring volatility to markets. The economy is strong so look for entry points on stocks that are “beat down” for no reason.

3809 2018-02-09 19:58:31 Market is driven by earnings. There has been no volatility in the past two years so don’t be emotional when there is volatility now... it’s healthy. Stay in equities. No I don’t think Powell has anything to do with it. When the market goes down.. stocks are on sale

3816 2018-02-09 19:57:08 Idea is to make # out of this right. Those reversals on stocks and crude were spectacular. Both tradeable. In multiple time-frames.

3823 2018-02-09 19:53:53 The Bots closed their hedge for +40 points gain so much less than the maximum 60 they could have made but still good. And they have now orders lined up for the close to buy several stocks.

3826 2018-02-09 19:52:39 the consensus position got stopped out

turns out it also included oil

it moves more than stocks when you sell
3827 2018-02-09 19:52:23 If you’re looking for a way to make money on the stock market realizing that Donald trump actually sucks for our economy, SPXS is a “stock” that goes up 3% for every 1% the S&P 500 goes down. JUUUUUUUST SAYING. You can buy it anywhere stocks and ETFs are sold
3828 2018-02-09 19:52:01 @CGasparino I agree with you that Trump should not have touted the market, but you saying that he told people to buy stocks is wrong. There was a fair share of touting @FoxBusiness, so they are equally guilty.

3831 2018-02-09 19:51:27 @trish_regan  According to genius Charlie we should not listen to anyone pushing the market. That would include your program/ network. He is such an idiot thinking ppl are too stupid to buy/ sell stocks on their own!!
3832 2018-02-09 19:51:18 I do that if I haven't been wanting to buy a stock for a while too. I meant changing the balance of my holding from 70% stocks to 40% or vice versa. But I agree with you on your point
3833 2018-02-09 19:51:02 #Stocks | Sometimes making a bottom can take time. Investors should be at least aware, cognizant, and expect a little more volatility after we go through this period of more cathartic volatility. cc. @BrynMawrTrust $DJIA $SPX $NDX $VIX
3834 2018-02-09 19:50:26 Why did stocks fall? Because we have to work for that expected return. It does not come free.
3835 2018-02-09 19:50:24 and most of the vol last few days it's been the BRL not really the stocks if you are looking the ADRs
3836 2018-02-09 19:49:40 @realDonaldTrump @cgaspari blaming trump?I never really liked you but I really think you’re off the wall you know nothing we don’t buy stocks because of him we buy stock because we love the money you idiot

3838 2018-02-09 19:49:20 strange that SNAP stocks were always low except now is going up??
Do you have any explanation for that?
3839 2018-02-09 19:49:18 @jimcramer Can you explain the following to a novice: If you follow the daily trends of a list of 4 random stocks in different sectors, they all tend to follow a similar pattern in rise and fall at the same exact time. How is that possible? What connects say Costco to Tesla?
3840 2018-02-09 19:48:28 @6BillionPeople said it best the other day. Think of where investors are heading next after bear market. With stocks down too, TRX is a great token for entry level and crypto vets to get in. #OnlyAMatterOfTime #trx #tron
3841 2018-02-09 19:47:58 @realDonaldTrump The Fed has to sell more debt than ever to cover the budget deficit that will be caused by Trumps Tax Plan for the rich. Bond Rates will go up, stocks will go down. The middle class gets hurt again
3842 2018-02-09 19:47:50 Folks, if you're trying the "Dogs of the Dow" strategy, the stocks you have to buy this month are All of the ones
3843 2018-02-09 19:47:49 You can definitely tell who is riding on the school bus by the similarities of their stocks.

3844 2018-02-09 19:47:19 Wall Street's worst week in almost seven years is ending with more turmoil. 
More than $5 trillion of value has been wiped out in the five-day global stocks meltdown, officially a market correction.   
3845 2018-02-09 19:46:48 I kinda understand panicky selling in stocks. Don’t really understand panicky selling in crude oil. Someone is making errors based on their belief in uncaused correlations.
3846 2018-02-09 19:46:43 Dow has traveled about 20000 points this week in a volatile few days that kicked off Monday with the Dow's biggest closing point drop on record.Stocks are falling as traders worry about  volatility as measured by the VIX has jumped. Mazak hai ye kya @iamrakeshbansal @JainSumeetS

3848 2018-02-09 19:46:04 I haven’t seen daily volatility this high in the stocks I hold, ever. Well in the nearly 15 years I have been using the stock market.
3849 2018-02-09 19:45:40 Hey @cvpayne if someone had $200,000+ to invest, and already owns several non-tech stocks, would you recommend diversifying in a managed acct or buying 1 or more tech stocks.
3850 2018-02-09 19:44:39 if my stocks drop and fricking lower i’m going to kms
3851 2018-02-09 19:44:32 if I was able to get anything out of a billionaire, id just want some stocks  in their company forever
3852 2018-02-09 19:44:22 Gun to my head, I think people will sell into the close, and we'll end up down for the day. But I am not selling my stocks, nor am I using options to express this somewhat weakly held view. 

99 percent of people shouldn't be changing their investments right now.
3853 2018-02-09 19:44:03 Many stocks still worth 5x - 10x times what they were worth at the bottom of our recent Great Recession. Remember: Ford $1.00 or BofA $4.97
3854 2018-02-09 19:43:30 I used to study stocks and some technicals, now Jim, you have me following VXX-Crazy! :)

3856 2018-02-09 19:42:00 the average bear market in #crypto is 71 days...the average bear market in #stocks is 15 months...kind of interesting comparison.
3857 2018-02-09 19:41:14 yes i know how stocks work. sorry for the mess up.
3858 2018-02-09 19:41:04 Think of the pay gap between a guidance counselor and a stock broker. You don't need an advanced degree to trade stocks.

3864 2018-02-09 19:39:33 Yeah it's not a true crash until the technicals define it as one. I didn't used to believe in TA when I first got into crypto (was never in stocks) but there does seem to be some real science to it.
3865 2018-02-09 19:39:13 That’s how stocks work. Buy low, sell high. If you don’t know this basic tenet of the market, please learn about stocks, mutual funds, and variable products before investing

3870 2018-02-09 19:38:15 @stocktwits 2nd idea. Most stocks may struggle to be even or 10% higher this year. CERS has a game changer Product that can result in huge revenue
and the Market wont matter. Don't worry about 3.50 or 4.00. That .50 wont matter when the stock is in the teens or higher.
3871 2018-02-09 19:37:37 I like google at 750. 500 even better. Just like over inflated stocks get under inflated too in times of panic.

3875 2018-02-09 19:36:18 $NVDA is showing higher volatility than on its 2017 advance, like most everything else. This makes profitable speculation or swing trading more challenging. The setup is not there either, but it is mentioned for watch list purposes in coming days/wks #stocks

NOC will complete acquisition of OA which adds about 30% to earns.

3903 2018-02-09 19:27:00 @APGovJacobsen what a coincidence that the week we fake buy stocks, the real stocks are dropping this much.  Just a coincidence I guess.
3904 2018-02-09 19:26:11 Media needs to stop writing headlines about mid-day losses or advances in the stock market. It's so volatile that as soon as they write a headline and get it online, it is wrong. "Another Wild Day for Stocks" should suffice.
3905 2018-02-09 19:25:51 Boomers treat stocks like a religion.

3930 2018-02-09 19:20:13 Tonight on @WWLP22News at 5: Stocks on Wall Street are continuing a volatile trend that started last week. @taylordichello will explain why this is actually normal.
3931 2018-02-09 19:20:12 During Nobama, Wall St speculated the DOW would never reach 20K, impossible since it floated around 10K. Then along comes Trump & it soars to 26,616 only 6 days into his term! Current adjustments aside, stocks have never been higher!
3932 2018-02-09 19:20:11 US stocks bounce to trade in green
3933 2018-02-09 19:20:02 Just now on CNN - reading that Dow drops another 500 points. Worst week for stocks since 2008. Guess the pink cloud is disappearing for Trump supporters.
3934 2018-02-09 19:19:57 It seems like until things settle, the threat of inflation chewing away at cash is still a better risk than the uncertainty of stocks or bonds. I humbly welcome your arguments against this and HOPE I can be convinced otherwise.

3942 2018-02-09 19:19:25 What do you mean by “money-like properties” that aren’t shared by all liquid assets? I’d certainly agree that much of their value is related to the fact that they are liquid assets, more liquid in some respects (not all, liquidity is multidimensional) than stocks or gold, etc.

3966 2018-02-09 19:12:40 Some say the stock market has been “manipulated” by the Fed, QE and low interest rates.  If so, then explain how the P-E ratio for the S&P 500 is 16.6 on expected 2018 earnings.  If stocks were lifted on a sea of liquidity, the P-E ratio would be above, not below, average.

3981 2018-02-09 19:08:57 This "booming" stock market is a house of cards, based on a bunch of big corporations buying back their own stocks in order to artificially-inflate the price of their shares. Only a matter of time until bullshit starts to stink.

3983 2018-02-09 19:08:19 Why did stocks crash on Black Monday in 1987?

It's still something of a mystery

Why did stocks fall over the past 10 days?

It's simple really. I'll start w/the latest wage growth data & work my way to ETFs & Fed manipulation...

4008 2018-02-09 19:02:19 Realistically, we may see about 16 weeks of volatility until this correction settles down.  It takes time for fund managers to reassess their portfolios, sell stocks, buy bonds, and possibly even pay for losses using by selling stocks, REITs or real estate.

4055 2018-02-09 18:53:47 Unless their little impact messes with employers who'll cut jobs before rattling investors. Tanking stocks matter when it destabilizes retirements or the world economy. I'm suspicious of media saying no biggie.
4056 2018-02-09 18:53:23 The more I look at charts the more worthless they seem. I can see places where stocks should bounce and I can also see them breaking down to the next level.

then once it goes down there’s no comment about it, they’re M.I.A. 
4145 2018-02-09 18:39:21 Yes, but they had no prior knowledge of what the stock market would do. If I say, "stocks will go up" and they go down, that's merely an incorrect prediction.

4176 2018-02-09 18:33:48 Quote from a recent conference Richard Bernstein: "we are a consumption economy. we no longer make things." Yet even he tells people to stay in stocks?
4177 2018-02-09 18:33:43 Sold some at a loss but still long most shares. The overall market is completely tanking so it makes it nearly impossible for penny stocks. Assuming the market doesn't continue to plummet for the next few days, I'm still bullish on this one.
4178 2018-02-09 18:33:37 Call me crazy, but i would start buying some of my fave stocks right about now while the Dow is down 400 pts.
4179 2018-02-09 18:33:23 Haven't seen panic selling yet. Though have seen big buying at the lows. Overall still expect continuation. #stocks $ES $NQ #patience

4181 2018-02-09 18:33:07 The global economy is strong.  The American economy is strong.  Rich people often SELL-OFF stocks to create CASH when it's good for them.  Look at a many-year graph of stock market & notice ups & downs but mostly UP UP UP.

4189 2018-02-09 18:31:36 yeah. You make money on investments by TAKING RISKS. this is literally what you get paid for at the end of the day & then when you're close to retirement you can rebalance out of stocks so you bear less risk

4191 2018-02-09 18:31:13 Thinking the bid in tens, if it holds, will provide somewhat of a bid to stocks going into the close.   No promises, no gtds, trend is down, just thinking how weak tens caused late day selling earlier in the week
4192 2018-02-09 18:31:03 Which one is the best website to buy stocks? Something like binance?

4201 2018-02-09 18:29:56 Great work as usual Jim, does the ATL Fed apparently reducing their GDP forecast to 4% reduce pressure on bonds thus helping stocks.....and curve steepening
4202 2018-02-09 18:29:56 $FCEL why are all the fuel cell stocks tanking now? They’re all down at least 5-7% after good news on ITC?? $HYGS $PLUG $BLDP
4203 2018-02-09 18:29:49 It's just awesome how easily profits can be made daily with safe & smart strategy! EVEN WHILE MARKET IS GOING DOWN!
It really doesn't matter to us, we're sitting in solid profit today again and focusing only on green stocks! There are ALWAYS green stocks!
4204 2018-02-09 18:29:42 Market is down 2000 points this week! Invest in gold/precious metals to hedge your losses. McEwen Mining Inc. is only $1.96/share and I am personally taking advantage of it's bargain price.

The stocks may be getting hammered but the price of bitcoin is higher. 
Currently, the price is up by about $512 on Coinbase at $8670.  But the price is trading at the highest level for the M-F trad…

My Psychology Composite that moved to P-6 on 1/24/08 (right at the top) has improved today to P-3, the point when you should start committing new money to stocks.  Psychology Composite is tremendous, in that you trust what the stock market is saying as long as-more
4208 2018-02-09 18:28:58 They say all the “old heads” (over 25) are tripping about the salary. Nah fam. Any smart “old head” with a family already got em covered. Stocks and bonds and businesses already in place. I’m still trashing young dudes tonight trying to make it. @WalkOnWarriors @youFamousEnough
4209 2018-02-09 18:28:47 Market and major stock trade at logical support areas aka the 50d and 200d MA. Don't chase the downside here as stocks are in a position to rally hard into the close after a brief shakeout below the marks! Be ready!
4210 2018-02-09 18:28:23 Maybe don’t invest in an index with only 30 stocks weighted by price 
4211 2018-02-09 18:28:19 I've never been much of a gambler, and that's probably why I haven't (except for once) invested in any stocks. I learned that if you don't have "fuck-you" money
you can well afford to lose, you should keep that cash under your mattress. :~)
4212 2018-02-09 18:28:18 PPL asking about my holdings. Yes I still have $X and the rest. Why, because there is still nothing wrong with $X or $T or $VZ their fundamentals and earnings haven't changed in a week. Even if the #StockMarket is becoming volatile many/ most quality stocks r still worth holding
4213 2018-02-09 18:28:11 are there any buyers at any level for oil stocks? wtf
4214 2018-02-09 18:28:10 @AndrewBellBNN Andrew I'm wondering what Renewable Energy stocks your guest would recommend.  Thanks!
4215 2018-02-09 18:28:05 I always thought of stocks as long term, rather than short term investment.
4216 2018-02-09 18:28:02 He is just pissed because Bitcoin is sound money and it is hard to mis-sell Bitcoin, unlike penny stocks.
4217 2018-02-09 18:27:42 Trump's rich friends SOLD stocks at peak & are much richer in the bank.  They will sell-off again when the time is right.  Normal people don't do what the rich can do.
4218 2018-02-09 18:27:28 I wish my stocks would quit plunging. Get this nation aright, Trump, and soon.

4220 2018-02-09 18:26:56 Yeah cuz stocks go by the calendar.
4221 2018-02-09 18:26:53 I have referred several friends and family to Robinhood and we have not received our referral stocks.  I have email you guys several times with of course absolutely no response.  They are upset because they felt conned in opening a Robinhood account with no referral stocks.
4222 2018-02-09 18:26:44 Yup. No credibility. They are laughing stocks, those evangelicals.
4223 2018-02-09 18:26:30 Lol I have a long list of red stocks on my app, and then I get to the 4 asshat “funds” you mentioned last night.
4224 2018-02-09 18:25:51 Best scenario for my Bots is we break all significant levels and close below 38, it will allow them to close their hedge and buy a couple of stocks on the cheap at the close.

4227 2018-02-09 18:25:34 I started investing in stocks and the stock market proceeded plummet
4228 2018-02-09 18:25:14 PPT would have lulled markets into sleep again
Only thing you have to focus from now on is " collusion of central banks to save banks and sacrificing future of common people"
" it's a globally rigged game so far and they own most markets now, stocks cannot fall until they want it
4229 2018-02-09 18:24:47 Wouldn't it be nice to get back to a market designed on strong fundamental theory?  One where you pick stocks based on free cash flow, leverage and all of the metrics we learned in school to look for?  A market where FANG isn't the only driver, and where NON-GAAP is irrelevant?
4230 2018-02-09 18:24:45 Stocks bounce and then fall.  Have not seen this since 2000/2001
4231 2018-02-09 18:24:27 Yup. Gold lower, Stocks lower, Yields higher... curse of Miners... Stocks driven by Gold but highly indebted so beholden to Bond Yields too... perfect storm right now.
4232 2018-02-09 18:24:24 And this is just a tiny fraction of the train wreck... and he keeps doubling down on his stupidity.  People would not be associating the stocks dropping with him if he hadn't INSISTED that the stock price rise was due to him personally.
4233 2018-02-09 18:24:24 HODL ur stocks guys
4234 2018-02-09 18:24:09 like i posted about 2 weeks ago, the market needed a 10% correction. some took profit, some moved cash from 1 area to another & some were just week hands. today is a great day to pick up discounted stocks while u can.

4240 2018-02-09 18:22:18 When was the last time the stock market behaved like this?

According to Yahoo article today by RIck Newman:
Not long ago at all. Just two years ago, in February 2016, stocks bottomed out around 14% lower than the peak reached in May of 2015. 

Interesting info

4263 2018-02-09 18:17:00 I recently sold 35% of my LAC stake. Took my 103-107% gain & re-invested it into Australian lithium stocks & cobalt instead. I'm not impressed w/ LAC's management's complete disregard for PR at this point. Main Street doesn't know who the f*** LAC is, & that's management's fault.

4310 2018-02-09 18:05:55 Volatility is your friend, not your enemy. Volatility is what lets stocks outperform government bonds in the long term.
4311 2018-02-09 18:05:52 Actually, same question re $FB. Gut tells me to just not buy today and come back fighting Monday. But just hard to imagine these stocks staying at these levels long.
4312 2018-02-09 18:05:36 Another bumpy day for stocks.
4313 2018-02-09 18:05:28 U.S. government briefly shuts down, reopens. Amazon to get into the shipping business. Stocks fall into correction territory.
4314 2018-02-09 18:05:27 Maybe investment in sound stable corporations and owning their stocks, supporting them as employers of the people, is actually a good thing. Perhaps it allows investors, regardless of wealth, a stable way of life.
4315 2018-02-09 18:05:19 SGX is giving some sleepless nights for fully invested people. Few big mistakes which I learnt from this fall:
1) Should track charts of Smallcap and Midcap index which we miss completely and always look for individual stocks.
2) Not holding cash even after earning quick money

4319 2018-02-09 18:03:56 Its obvious the Dow Jones stock market plunge is, in part, due to billionaires selling off their stocks given the benefits of their #GOPTaxScam  Its simply connecting-the-dots.

4326 2018-02-09 18:03:20 $SQ $20 still looks like fair value for Square. If you got major profits, take them! Don’t let it all evaporate! #square #stocks
4327 2018-02-09 18:03:20 You rock Jim.  It looks like an out of stocks, into a Bitcoin that's already dropped shift to me.
4328 2018-02-09 18:03:13 Bonds have been hit much harder than stocks.
4329 2018-02-09 18:02:55 Vicious circle? Falling stock prices leads to higher bond yields which leads stocks to fall even more?
4330 2018-02-09 18:02:50 investors display flight to safety from stocks to $BTC.X
4331 2018-02-09 18:02:43 You know, in all seriousness, the one thing that is different that I see, is the entire world is fiat (even the Swiss), and global central banks have no problem monetizing bonds and often stocks. Not sure what the end game is in this world.
4332 2018-02-09 18:02:25 As the late, great @JeffMacke always says, stocks do t routinely bottom on a Friday
4333 2018-02-09 18:02:15 Overall concept is nice just wish you could've done something different with text and maybe place the stocks in better places :)
4334 2018-02-09 18:01:34 Hope Trump owns all of those stocks. Apologies to regular Americans. #TrumpStockCrash #ThanksDick

4341 2018-02-09 17:59:57 People with common sense know. 

Fools on Wall Street thought stock buy backs would keep the rolling in BIGLY! Over looking the fact that stocks had been increasing for over a year for no good reason. Reality had to set in sooner, or later.

4343 2018-02-09 17:59:57 U.S. stocks were falling again on Friday as the Dow Jones industrial average headed for its worst week since October 2008.

4354 2018-02-09 17:57:43 Yes the plot thickens, day by day. Popcorn stocks will be through the roof 2018
4355 2018-02-09 17:57:42 Not the 1st to say, but WEEKLY earnings were actually down due to hours falling more than wages rose. So stocks were hit due to misread NFP?
4356 2018-02-09 17:57:36 PSA for all my fellow millennials: you have a couple decades of buying stocks ahead of you. The cheaper they are while you’re buying, the better. Embrace the correction!

4358 2018-02-09 17:57:21 People own stocks in military arms manufacturers.  They need to be paid back for their donations to Trump's campaign.

4361 2018-02-09 17:56:55 Wasn't it @htsfhickey who said share buyback pushes stocks on the way up, but then causes increases acceleration to the downside when bull market ends.

4366 2018-02-09 17:54:26 I don't know if you played it, but MH Tri on Wii had a great customize system for bowguns where you could craft barrel, bodies, and stocks and based on the combo determined if they was heavy or light, ammo, deviation, etc. I miss that; that game made me love bowguns.

4369 2018-02-09 17:53:54 @DBChirpy volatile stocks mirror volatile USA governing. Crisis to crisis. Shutdown to shutdown Russians to Trump. Trump to Russians. Lack of stability is sign of USA vulnerability.
4370 2018-02-09 17:53:48 untrue. stocks turn before fundies. ALWAYS
4371 2018-02-09 17:53:39 spx getting destroyed -money about to rotate into gold and gold miners like 2016. This last puke of gdx with the massive short interest that is going to have to be covered-looks great for rest of year for gold stocks
4372 2018-02-09 17:53:35 I said this morning on my @PeriscopeCo watch the action in Bonds/Treasuries as #ES_F goes down,the buying in bonds when ES has been going down has been less & less;Seeing less confidence in that trade. Watch todays close if stocks & bonds go down together...gets ugly for both IMO
4373 2018-02-09 17:53:13 I wish somebody would!!! They’re after our fishing quotas now as well so they can clean our stocks out and damage them beyond repair before Brexit
4374 2018-02-09 17:52:44 What do you think is going to happen when stocks don't do a 1987 crash on Monday? Hmmm... when people realize that. - bullish theory
4375 2018-02-09 17:52:43 @MClarkEcon crypto way up today, surging when stocks went down, so there's a good sign in terms of remaining independent from stocks.  Only one data point though.

4387 2018-02-09 17:49:08 USD/JPY hits stops in fall to lowest since September USD/JPY down 50 pips on the day
It's getting ugly out there. Stocks are reeling and they've finally pulled down USD/JPY as the pair broke through the January low to the worst since September.
4388 2018-02-09 17:49:05 Yup. Trying to find the same. Severely undervalued is very difficult these days. Op leverage is usually missed in under-followed stocks and hence was focusing on that. But now it's gaining traction amongst investor community.

4396 2018-02-09 17:47:37 Here it comes; the robots are incontrol of investment s. Don' t blink, you notice stocks come back 40pts lose 60pts steady decline. As we get closer to the closing bell this departure will evaborate. The gap between gains & loses will be gone. 3:30 downward spiral closing @-989
4397 2018-02-09 17:47:25 13% is considered a ‘correction’ in stocks and historically takes 4 months to reach previous highs. What percentage could be considered a correction for #Bitcoin? 20%? Maybe 30%? What is the line between correction and crash?
4398 2018-02-09 17:47:23 constrained (OPEC+).  Shale is increasing, but beyond EIA adjustment shock, in line with expectations.  Stocks continue to decline (seasonally).  US based E&P's continue to restrain cap-ex, with interest rate hikes and tax reform, constraining debt attractiveness.
4399 2018-02-09 17:47:21 It’s a long overdue correction. Plus interest rates are rising - as they should. Stocks have been artificially inflated due to being only thing with an investment return for years.

4416 2018-02-09 17:44:17 When the govt borrows money, they get first dibs, which drives up interest rates for everyone else, making the bond market more alluring...

4428 2018-02-09 17:40:46 Agreed. Like most of you out there I wish I had raised more, knowing that stocks - especially biotech - don't move up forever. Now, it is a matter of acting against my emotional instincts and selectively buy some companies. Just added $SELB.

4438 2018-02-09 17:38:19 Dean, i keep telling you. Now is not the time to worry, but to buy.  Stocks are selling at a discount.  Use that extra money from the tax bill and buy some stocks.

4444 2018-02-09 17:36:41 Like it says on Bloomberg, fundamentals are good in USA, economy is booming, tax cuts, jobs, yet stocks are going down? Are the banks just cashing in on the retail longs and they shorting markets to cash in?
4445 2018-02-09 17:36:27 Is it cynical to wonder if this stock market sell off doesn't prime the pump for people to do stock buy backs at a reduced rate? Everyday people with stocks get spooked by these down turns & sell off then bigger investors scoop them up for less.
4446 2018-02-09 17:36:26 I have large stocks to clear also.

4450 2018-02-09 17:36:03 Since three days we are seeing an inverse correlation between Stocks and Bitcoin. If this situation continues to exist, more traditional investors will see Bitcoin as a "store of value" or even as a safe haven play which will fuel Bitcoin prices.  Time will tell if so.

4457 2018-02-09 17:34:07 There's no sign of the tax cuts leading to higher wages, and the min wage initiatives started long ago with no such effects on stocks. Those tax cuts are, apparently, leading to layoffs, however, as companies decide a nice big windfall should be turned to stock buybacks instead.

4462 2018-02-09 17:33:28 Topics that would interest me: BTC history, BCH vs BTC, ICOs, LTC, Ethereum, Ripple, BTC Futures, Taxes 1099, Chart analysis/RSI, How to store private keys, How to invest without emotion, Dollar cost averaging, Stocks vs Crypto, Future outlook for blockchain in 2018 and beyond.
4463 2018-02-09 17:32:49 Over decades we built up an interconnected & comprehensive network of joint reserve stocks, special collections, inter-library loans etc. Now because of library cuts/closures & 'alternative delivery models' we've got a postcode lottery of provision, a regressive disgrace.
4464 2018-02-09 17:32:47 Who cares as long as the stock runs

4468 2018-02-09 17:31:12 It's funny when you start out in crypto before you buy stocks and see stock folks flipping shit over daily 3% swings in the market.
4469 2018-02-09 17:31:07 You forgot. Stocks still higher than at any time during Obama’s admin. Unemployment at 45 year lows. Food stamp usage at all time lows and wages rising for first time in over a decade. I’m sure just a oversight.

4472 2018-02-09 17:30:40 Stocks really starting to look oversold. Remember that the selloff is not rooted in a gloomy economic outlook but rather the opposite. Full employment produces inflationary pressures and a rise in bond yield, thus lowering the risk premium for owning stocks.
4473 2018-02-09 17:30:39 Let's see what the afternoon brings. The last several days, saw accelerating selling going into the close. May happen again today, build that list of stocks you like, and start buying later today, or early next week.
4474 2018-02-09 17:30:39 agreed. and core inflation has been pretty steady since those yoy commodity effects in early 2017, but bonds could still sell on a highish print. 

i think the time to get bearish bonds has passed tho, especially with stocks looking so terrible. pension $ to come in soon too!

4488 2018-02-09 17:27:07 Land Officer Aubry Dunn says most of the growth (75%) has come from Land Office, not from stocks. "Some day we're going to quit adding to the fund. Oil and gas is a finite resource." Need to think about that as you look at taking more money from fund. #nmleg #nmpol
4489 2018-02-09 17:27:03 In Europe most #stocks leaders have very damaged charts. It will take a few weeks to fix them. One I still like is #Ferrari, still holding supports
4490 2018-02-09 17:27:02 No I do hold a few dividend stocks but mostly trade on the TSX I just think because of the blood bath in the DOW we will see a sell off at end of day in the TSX I could be wrong
4491 2018-02-09 17:26:58 In recent years, the low rates, low volatility and higher asset prices (Stocks, Real Estate, etc) is being derailed.  Ben & Yellen model.

       The problem stems from the practices of risk-parity and balanced mutual funds, which are forced to de-risk......
4503 2018-02-09 17:22:43 It was not long ago, we joked about rates will never rise and stocks will never decline.  Things changed quick.

4519 2018-02-09 17:19:06 Interest rates do not go up because of stocks and stocks are not totally a reflection of the economy. The TSX has done so poorly because of its over dependence on oil and gold and it's lack of technology listings.

4600 2018-02-09 17:02:02 Is there an efficient-market consistent reason why stocks should go down if interest rates go up?
4601 2018-02-09 17:01:38 @realDonaldTrump Stocks keep diving day after day... You can drive stocks up, can’t you? Do something “genius”!

4603 2018-02-09 17:01:28 Already did. It's a bubble and it's going to blow before 2018 is though. Promise the moon-lambo blockchain stocks like $LFIN & $OSTK  trading at > $1 B market cap.  $SNAP and $TSLA losing money Model 3 over Model 3.

4605 2018-02-09 17:01:10 (US) Market Trading Hours: 
US stocks worst week since 2011 European debt crisis 
After yesterday's horrific market close buyers emerged ahead of the opening bell. Bouts of intense selling ensued though as all eyes remain on the S&P's 200-day SMA as the week draws to a close.

4607 2018-02-09 17:00:16 Core euro zone bond yields edged down today as renewed selling in world stocks lent some support to safe-haven debt markets, which themselves have been bruised as investors brace for an end to easy-monetary policies by major central banks.

4609 2018-02-09 16:59:49 Stocks for the long run? The FTSE 100 is just 2% above its end-1999 level. Even with dividends, bonds would have paid more

4611 2018-02-09 16:58:26 @benshapiro You hold bonds you lose. You hold stocks you lose. You sell off, your dollars lose.
4612 2018-02-09 16:58:04 UPDATE: Stocks shed gains as sharp swings persists; major indexes poised for big weekly drops- Marketwatch
4613 2018-02-09 16:57:51 I take exception. I know. Because it's a bubble and it's going to burst.  Penny stocks are trading on the exchanges at dotBomb multiples: $LFIN, $RIOT, $KODK.  Valuations of even good companies will not survive rate hikes and gov't budget deficit increases.
4614 2018-02-09 16:57:43 Most Americans are not that impacted. Most are struggling to make ends meet & don't own stocks.
4615 2018-02-09 16:56:54 Good to see those stocks bouncing back, like when you drop an egg on the floor. #correction

4617 2018-02-09 16:56:28 Jesus guys, TO THOSE WHO NEVER TOOK AN ECON CLASS: STOCKS. ARE. NOT. THE. ECONOMY.

The economy is doing *extremely* well right now, and is continuing to do so.

The stock market, as READ IN THIS EXACT ARTICLE, are going through a correction. This happens all the time. Calm down.
4618 2018-02-09 16:56:11 Not me. I've sold all my stocks. Now my trades are very short time frames. Either short or long, whatever the market wants to do. This looks ugly to me v
4619 2018-02-09 16:55:55 Monday: Bitcoin is a currency
Tuesday: Bitcoin is a hedge against fiat
Wednesday: Bitcoin is actually a store of value
Thursday: Bitcoin is basically a hedge against stocks
Friday: Bitcoin is essentially correlated with the stock market
4620 2018-02-09 16:55:51 As there has been so little volatility for so long its easy to forget (at least for me) stocks go down hyper faster then they go up.

4624 2018-02-09 16:54:52 Portfolio weathering the storm quite nicely so far, a modest +3% for the week. Solid fundamentals and strong upcoming newsflow has helped protect my stocks from the wider market misery.

4625 2018-02-09 16:54:38 @benshapiro Dude. 10 yrs ZIRP. Zero interest % means you make nothing by saving. So you throw it into stocks. It bubbles.
4626 2018-02-09 16:53:30 obvious that crypto is a bubble
  and stocks will go up forever.
  -last week.
4627 2018-02-09 16:52:50 From my perspective, the market is healthy when individual leading stock charts are healthy and stocks are breaking out to highs on expanding volume. We simply don’t have that. Not even close.

4633 2018-02-09 16:51:19 U.S. government briefly shuts down, reopens. Amazon to get into the shipping business. Stocks fall into correction territory.
4634 2018-02-09 16:50:52 What's a reasonable PE ratio for TSLA, AMZN, and NFLX?
50? 100?

If either of these answers is correct, then the market could drop a lot more. And these stocks would need to lead the way lower!
4635 2018-02-09 16:50:35 So many stocks are at key levels, any further weakness will really hurt.  $SPX $AAPL $GOOGL $BABA.

4640 2018-02-09 16:49:11 Stocks continuing to slow a little. New lows, but higher off the low now. TREND STILL DOWN, FULL HEDGES ON. Looks like a little sideways for while maybe?  Waiting for the up direction whenever it decides to head that way.  Meanwhile, enjoy the ride!
4641 2018-02-09 16:48:42 I think a solid 1000 point gap down on Monday, and a face ripping snap back, may kick start things again.

4687 2018-02-09 16:36:34 very true. What I'm learning doing so much stock-specific research here @TDANetwork is how the very same macro trends leave footprints in stocks. If you were buried in earnings from the start of reporting, you felt the tension no doubt. Great topline number was not the story.

4892 2018-02-09 15:51:12 That violates the ability to pay principle. That is why we tend to tax flows rather than stocks. Forcing people to liquidate capital to pay taxes is bad news.  A consumption (e.g. of natural resources) tax would be better.

4988 2018-02-09 15:23:41 Fomo is literally non existent. There is always a trade set up somewhere on the 1500+ crypto mkt. If not there’s forex to trade. If not then there’s stocks to trade, or metals, or oil, or CFD’s or Bonds. There’s a million ways to make money online just pick one and have fun

5092 2018-02-09 15:00:22 @realDonaldTrump It's time.  The major internet stocks (FACE) are too powerful. Recently, AMZN announced it would compete in the delivery biz, and UPS stock has tanked. The fact that an announcement can disrupt so many lives, is proof that they're too dominant and powerful.

Wait for the wreckage and then buy into super large cap stocks in the DOW or in the S&P 500. Forget the central bank shysters and their toadies.

5279 2018-02-09 14:24:15 Stocks are tanking because Wall Street surrendered control to computer models. Read Clancy’s “Debt of Honor” as what’s happening is right out of the pages of an act of war.

5281 2018-02-09 14:23:42 For political purposes, however, the rise of the stock market will affect somebody with a $100k portfolio more than one with a $1bb portfolio. More likely to prompt lifestyle changes and reductions in stress (Disclaimer: Trump is a monster and stocks will be going lower)

5285 2018-02-09 14:23:11 Takes a big man to admit mistake. Live and learn. What helped me not sell was the belief that th stocks were being shorted.

5289 2018-02-09 14:21:46 That’s why no accountability. If CNBC actually showed how bad his stock picks and calls really are then they would be screwed. Hes entreating but horrible stock picker now.

5374 2018-02-09 13:56:45 Jim.just retired.need recommendations...wanna buy 20,000 worth of stocks....100 shares each
5375 2018-02-09 13:56:38 Hi there, our kits are made up of spice blends, stocks, pastes and marinades! Each are unique & have been developed by our chef :)
5376 2018-02-09 13:56:35 You r right, we don’t need all this stimulus. Even Keynes would argue that. Though, it’s not necessarily wasteful but it likely will cause stocks to fall and interest rates to rise. And if ppl and companies have too much debt then those high interest rates can cause problems.
5377 2018-02-09 13:56:24 Markets are funny: "The economy is going strong! Interest rates to rise! Sell all your stocks!!!"
5378 2018-02-09 13:56:21 The original idea was, pay 4 qualified help, pay enough so they could shop @ the store and spend money. That worked, until Bob Nardelli took over as CEO & a customer got 1 minute of service 4 every $ spent. That was the matrix. In studied it. Most people can't afford 2 buy stocks
5379 2018-02-09 13:56:12 Absolutely. Go for it flyers.
5380 2018-02-09 13:56:00 We are worried for our country. Stocks are correcting itself now because a lack of this following rules, seems to be a free for all repl. and dems. Our country's rule of law will fail. Think about that
5381 2018-02-09 13:55:48 Does Denmark still have stocks of naval mines? 
5382 2018-02-09 13:55:34 Amazon just announced they will start their own shipping business!
UPS and FedEx stocks tanking.
USPS also now is useless besides for random coupons... but Groupon is gonna take over that.
The world is changing as we know it.
Amazon is taking over the universe!
5383 2018-02-09 13:55:24 Which strategy is that?  Selling usts to sell stocks? Risk Un-Parity?
5384 2018-02-09 13:55:15 Snap and Roku stocks managed to avoid the slide that carried just about every tech stock down with the broader market on Monday.
5385 2018-02-09 13:54:51 Those stocks got sold to cover the inverse leveraged trade.  It’s all connected.  Passive funds are... passive.
5386 2018-02-09 13:54:24 I think that @SEC_Enforcement should take a look at these volatility indexes. They are distorting the value of stocks which will cause a lack of confidence in the overall market. Greed is NOT good.
5387 2018-02-09 13:54:23 I have animal crossing on the brain. So much that due to how the stocks tumbled down so hard, all I can think about is Turnip prices.
5388 2018-02-09 13:53:57 Can’t wait until stocks open and watch
5389 2018-02-09 13:53:36 Yeah....to me at this point of time glass looks half full...because since last three days...smart money is buying buying and buying select stocks!!
5390 2018-02-09 13:53:19 No looking for bargains on good stocks...1 maybe 2 stocks.
5391 2018-02-09 13:52:32 Slight possible problem - What if I run in wearing my mask, with my entrance music playing and they think they’re being robbed? Actually, I haven’t got time to worry. It’ll be fine. Off to get my mask....
5392 2018-02-09 13:52:12 My favourite time of the week - accumulation on 3 stocks as people start to unwind for the weekend but it's my job to buy cheap and todays market provides that
5393 2018-02-09 13:51:52 80% of Americans disapproved of health care repeal, and I’ll bet the same percentage support legislation to outlaw bump stocks. I’m kinda surprised anymore when they do what we want.
5394 2018-02-09 13:51:45 I did not know who will buy USA stocks after..
5395 2018-02-09 13:51:23 None want to admit that Share Prices are #Inflated and these corrections must be done! #Bloomberg #CNBCTV18Market IF Amazon liquidated today can they pay >$1,000 for each and every share sold? NO! Many Stocks are way over value! #CNN
5396 2018-02-09 13:50:46 STOCKS STOCKS STOCKS DOWN DOWN DOWN!!!!
5397 2018-02-09 13:50:44 Everything-and more. How’s that work? Also, job creation still lags behind 2016. And oh, thenstick market. Still blaming the stocks themselves and media? Commander combover is the embarrassment of a lifetime- and more!
5398 2018-02-09 13:50:43 Stocks too choppy atm, tug-o-war going on in the US bond market, so i've been enjoying the boost in cryptos after the SEC's and Congress' very positive attitude towards cryptocurrencies this week
5399 2018-02-09 13:50:31 Great... Good job Congress. Had nothing to do with you. But it is just in time for wasting more of our money golfing... I know you was at your shit course during the last shutdown as well. Hey, hows those stocks, and Sean H's fake account Assange emailed about Warner to?
5400 2018-02-09 13:50:30 Sold all my stocks. Market on some other shit right now. I'll get back in them when they ready to calm tf down lol
5401 2018-02-09 13:50:04 Stocks are falling and cryptos are rising...Looks like we are going to see some Wall Street boys jump to BTC this weekend.
5402 2018-02-09 13:49:35 Deffo give it a go! Don’t forget your entry music.
5403 2018-02-09 13:48:57 Ang alin po? Stocks ko po. 
5404 2018-02-09 13:48:40 How did your stocks do yesterday?
5405 2018-02-09 13:48:32 #Conspiracy Because the same kleptocrats that own the media own most of the stocks.
5406 2018-02-09 13:48:27 That's like selling your stocks when the market tanks and they are worth the least amount.....wait that's what people usually do ;)
5407 2018-02-09 13:47:57 real wage growth means the fed may be increasing interest rates sooner than expected. Also bond yields spiked up so people are moving money out of stocks to bonds
5408 2018-02-09 13:47:35 No when the market goes up my stocks gain value and I make money LMFAO
5409 2018-02-09 13:47:15 Priceline, TripAdvisor stocks sink after Expedia earnings fall short
5410 2018-02-09 13:46:56 Speculators getting killed on Wall Street, Margin Calls flying out via E-mail, people who bought stocks in the AM and placed stop loss Orders also getting hurt big time
5411 2018-02-09 13:46:12 That looks very similar to when Hillary Clinton short-sold stocks in pharmaceutical companies -- the day after she made a pharmaceutical-related speech that vilified those same companies.    (I think, that was in 1993 -- while she was the self-appointed healthcare tzarina.)
5412 2018-02-09 13:45:57 Breaking Canada in two, day by day. Sad libtards are hell bent on ruining everything good in this country and Alberta is left to fend for itself (again). But not unexpected with past protester Knotly in charge. TSX can’t live on pot stocks & blockchain alone.
5413 2018-02-09 13:45:54 Just don’t go public with it. I don’t intend to  if I win, just say I’m investing in stocks and shares.
5414 2018-02-09 13:45:44 #Breaking Both UPS & Fedex stocks drop drastically after Amazon announces their new shipping service to compete with the two delivery companies
5415 2018-02-09 13:45:24 What slump? Stocks up over 20% since Trump was elected, what are you the guy guy who wishes for the market to crash so that it hurts the rest of us as long as it makes trump look bad?
5416 2018-02-09 13:45:06 A consumption tax on everything? Like food? Clothing (whether new or used?)? Medicine? Doctor's visits? 
How about stocks? 
REALLY rich people will just buy the BIG stuff (yachts, cars, vacation homes) outside the country and avoid the tax. If it's applied to stocks, ditto.
5417 2018-02-09 13:44:27 Economy looking up, stocks should look up as well, money needs to be invested by private sector to improve economic conditions, not stored in government and company bank accounts!
5418 2018-02-09 13:44:16 @FoxNews Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell and the corrupt Republican party gave $2 trillion to the wealthiest people on this planet and now our economy is going to suffer mortgage rates are going up stocks are going down. And now they want to cut Social Security Medicare or Medicaid
5419 2018-02-09 13:43:33 Now that there really is blood in the streets, time to look at microcaps, #OTCs and #commodities. There's always a market to trade! And finally MJ stocks will get some traction!
5420 2018-02-09 13:43:30 How dem stocks bud
5421 2018-02-09 13:43:19 #stocks Trading options on derivatives or any leveraged instrument looks so tempting. 99.9 percent of investors should leave these trades to experienced institutional traders. They or their brokerage house have the resources to absorb the shock of a loss. Do you?
5422 2018-02-09 13:43:15 Boost to #marijuana stocks: Canadian Depository for Securities on Thurs said the rules governing what is listed should be left to stock exchanges. TMX and TSXV @TMXGroup will not list shares of cannabis companies cob in USA.  @CSE_News will.
5423 2018-02-09 13:43:09 Means your denfense stocks will go up. Btw you really are mentally slow. It’s sad to see how low your IQ really is.
5424 2018-02-09 13:43:02 PYC £4m cap drops a RNS with a contract worth £70k & sustains a 10% rise. #AERO £3.2m cap drops a RNS with a contract worth £1.1m & doesn't rise. Fickle world of AIM aside its a small deal but vs cap its a deal that warrants a raise of this stocks value.
5425 2018-02-09 13:42:53 The stocks are still down much like you want to be on your daughter
5426 2018-02-09 13:42:53 #MarketUpdate: #NSELive 2:38PM: Nigerian #Stocks end lower for the 5th day in a row, down by 0.46% on continued profit-taking
5427 2018-02-09 13:42:47 The #GOP touts the Dow as a sign of a strong economy. 

Workers get minuscule wage raise (I mean tiny) in 1 month and the Dow tanks. 

Interesting.

5428 2018-02-09 13:42:15 Oh now stocks are down it's Trump? Thought you liberals said it was Obama's? Smh
5429 2018-02-09 13:41:43 Thanks to #chickentrump I lost 1500$ in stocks this week. #chicken 
5430 2018-02-09 13:41:18 No matter how far stocks fall, this is the bottom.
5431 2018-02-09 13:40:58 It was good for fish stocks but if we made our own laws it would be better and more relevant to our waters, I can do this all day why not just take it onboard ?
5432 2018-02-09 13:40:22 Well, now is as good a time as any. What stocks or funds were you looking at? You can never go wrong with more VTSAX
5433 2018-02-09 13:40:13 Great idea.  I wonder if I have time to pop home and get it now?  Strike while the iron’s hot...and all that!
5434 2018-02-09 13:40:06 I kept thinking "Right, I must be better", getting up and then retreating back to bed.  As solo, hope (easy) food stocks good.
5435 2018-02-09 13:39:31 The stock holders saw the highly increased prices of the stocks they owned and decided to cash in and enlarge their bank accounts, that’s what happened.

5440 2018-02-09 13:37:34 headline is correct. Investors react to stocks sell off by pulling back on equity #ETFs not reverse.

5454 2018-02-09 13:33:07 Simple pump and dump method to buy back they're own stock a massively cheap prices. Penny stocks on a grand scale
5455 2018-02-09 13:32:28 Stocks up from here, bonds down. Then stocks down, and bonds remaining between their lows and yesterdays close.
5456 2018-02-09 13:32:17 They key is in all scenarios (pullback to 200 day, no pullback to 200 day), in a bull market stocks are typically higher in 6-months to a year.
5457 2018-02-09 13:32:10 What's ur problem with online sales? There r no pvt gun shows. Bump stocks don't turn anything into an automatic weapon. Machine guns are heavily regulated & nit easily available. You've seen too many Hollywood movies.

5463 2018-02-09 13:29:19 It’s hard to be a long-term investor when you watch your stocks every second. If you want to be a better investor, get rid of all distractions that promote short-term thinking. Turn off the TV and pick up a book and learn something that is additive to your long-term success.

5473 2018-02-09 13:24:21 I wonder where all that money went. Margin calls, volatility losses, other stocks, ETFs. Cash. Bonds???
5474 2018-02-09 13:23:10 Orange Tsunami takes America to new lows setting standards for mediocre malignant government Worst leader in US history demands parade to celebrate compound failures. Stocks react to targeting of fellow Americans without mercy. Worst ever. Silent on gun mayhem. Tremendous failure
5475 2018-02-09 13:23:04 Cash in all your stocks. This economy crash will be one of a kind. This is the first crash warning.
5476 2018-02-09 13:22:54 I most likely will be looking at other candidates in 2020. Trump has shown a total disregard for the recent 1,000 point drops in Dow stocks.
5477 2018-02-09 13:22:41 Indeed, people don’t get that this time the bond market may be truly vulnerable, which means bonds and stocks could prove correlated to the downside, very dangerous for most

5482 2018-02-09 13:20:55 poor outcomes on the scale of mid staffs.  It is always systemic breakdown, and no amount of doctors and nurses in the stocks will change that.  Stop looking for bloody retribution, look for solutions.  And if you cannot understand complexity, maybe just keep your mouth shut.
5483 2018-02-09 13:20:42 I just heard some analyst on CNBC say that while the averages were down significantly, individual stocks weren’t hurt so bad. I’m too old for “the new math” in school; maybe I missed a change in the meaning of “average”

5489 2018-02-09 13:18:23 Spoken like an envious child.  It's about ownership.  Own good quality stocks that pay a good dividend, and the numbers will matter a lot less over time.  We all know those are "unrealized" dollars.  They're as fleeting as #BTC.

5502 2018-02-09 13:11:32 Doesn't matter. They have monetisation. Their stocks still went up. That's all they care about. They still make the money from it

5504 2018-02-09 13:11:17 as the larger stock market sinks and people dont see as much growth as they did then more and more eye balls will find its way to #potstocks b/c here 'growth' opportunity is still alive. imo, a bad stock market is good for #cannabis #MMJ stocks.

5508 2018-02-09 13:08:31 It is not true that there hasn't been a correction in the last 9 years. There have been several 'stealth' corrections when the majority of stocks have acted poorly but a few big caps covered up the action.  @jimcramer @DougKass

5510 2018-02-09 13:08:02 What is going on with the stocks lately 
5511 2018-02-09 13:07:29 So German bonds at less than 1% and Japanese bonds at about 0% are a better deal even as the Dollar begins to rise??  The Double-Whammy comes when bonds and notes rise even as the Dollar goes up.  It's a play that can last several months, depending upon whether stocks recover.
5512 2018-02-09 13:07:23 To the Panel: Is the unwinding in volatility really more the tail waging the dog where the DEBT instruments, like the $HYG, are really controlling what's happening to Stocks?
(Treasury Y% Pops --> $HYG Drops (increasing Div% for Fund) --> Infects Stocks.)

5514 2018-02-09 13:06:18 It's interesting to watch people who own a lot of stocks/bonds and ARE BUYING a lot of stocks/bonds while the US stock market is down...

Tell people who don't own a lot of stocks/bonds and want to buy stocks/bonds to NOT BUY while the market is down.

5539 2018-02-09 12:58:10 Sell-off in stocks is typical, if a little quicker than usual. Big story is the coordinated sell-off in rates, credit, and inflation assets at the same time. Reminiscent of policy errors in 2004, 1994, late 60s. Unexpected jump in expected future cash rates affects all assets.

5634 2018-02-09 12:10:19 it says a lot that stocks can collapse into the close yesterday and yet bonds can't maintain a decent bid
5635 2018-02-09 12:10:00 Decided to delete my snap since y’all decided to update to that garbage layout WITHOUT my consent. @snapchatsupport @Snapchat That’s why y’all stocks have dropped so low. Terrible. And STOP telling consumers to get used to things instead of listening and catering to their wants.

5659 2018-02-09 11:59:37 So we don’t know if the  decline in stocks is because of adjusting interest rates or volatility index readjustments, however if we wait and the sell off was because of bonds are we then not too late to sell? Thanks!
5660 2018-02-09 11:59:28 #StockMarketCrash #stocks Friday's market may indeed finish on the positive side, but if you look at the NASDAQ and tech indices the bloodbath was even greater.

5662 2018-02-09 11:58:55 I think I'm going to start investing in stocks and shares. Only sure wins (10/20%) gains and not unicorns (x100 value). Anyone got suggestions on where to start?  #investing #stocks #shares #money
5663 2018-02-09 11:58:24 The USD still quiet but stocks remain weak. Many were hoping for a decent bounce this morning after the open.
5664 2018-02-09 11:58:18 I think it differentiates prolonged correction/pain, end of party vs run of the mill correction. People have to flock back to stocks at some point, only game in town.

5667 2018-02-09 11:57:45 Much more important is where 10-year Treasurys go ... sure, we will have an oversold bounce very soon, but beyond that will be dictated by how intact bond market stays.  Treasurys and stocks will be correlated to the downside if the former keeps showing downside.
5668 2018-02-09 11:57:37 GOOG, one of the FAANG stock, Very good support is 960/970 & 990/1000.? Action in these stocks will impact NQ eventually.

5675 2018-02-09 11:53:08 Reasonable observation - thank you. I think the Fed was intended for manageable blow-up the bubble in equities but it is not keen to induce a major crash. For that reason, crashes in commodities are abrupt but in stocks "Fed put" restrains the fall.

5755 2018-02-09 11:06:56 I believe there's some correlation. Speculation is a strong incentive. Investors will move their funds back and forth depending on best opportunity. When stocks drop huge, speculators pull funds from #crypto and throw it in the stock market.

5760 2018-02-09 11:02:41 @minliangtan Bought some Razer Stocks. But it kept plunging to oblivion... Show some love please?
5761 2018-02-09 11:01:15 You can't use stocks to buy stuff therefore everyone has to sell them at one point. You can use crypto to buy stuff therefore you never need to sell it. Massive difference!
5762 2018-02-09 11:01:13 I have previously invested in currencies, stocks and commodities. Because of my interest in technology and science, I have recently explored the crypto world. I find this development interesting and promising.
5763 2018-02-09 11:01:05 No, I’m fine here… *Clears his throat.* And your ~stocks~.
5764 2018-02-09 11:00:37 Judging from the latest market action, there seem to be investors thinking "Oh my God, stocks are a bubble! 
Better buy something safe like Bitcoin!"

5765 2018-02-09 10:59:32 If it’s a larger amount you could also look at some of the Stocks and Shares ISAs on offer. Not sure of tax implications but they would probably offer better returns than a cash ISA.
5766 2018-02-09 10:58:26 68.7% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders long to short at 2.2 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 7.5% lower than yesterday and 16.7% lower from last week.

5771 2018-02-09 10:57:09 Thinking about deepening my chart knowledge also. But it's not all about charts. News, stocks, sentiment and others things come in to play also.

5773 2018-02-09 10:55:51 Play the long game. No big deal
5774 2018-02-09 10:55:32 There are two categories of securities linked to price turbulence, roughly speaking: ones tied to the #VIX directly, and others that take their cue from the volatility of individual stocks. Altogether, estimates for the space are anywhere from $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion.
Crazy
5775 2018-02-09 10:54:53 Yeah that's beyond me. I'm happy to sit and wait with mostly cash but also to pick off a few cheapies on stocks I know. Got some $CIO at .027 today as it always bounces from there.
5776 2018-02-09 10:54:48 For me it's more general than that -  US is starting to look like a third world country (politically) and the question frankly is "why pay a first-world multiple for stocks?"
5777 2018-02-09 10:54:16 Glad market is down , I can buy stocks at low and just be have to be patience !
5778 2018-02-09 10:53:45 If I read any more comments about anyone living high off the hog on their 401Ks or their stock dividends, thanks to Drumpf, I'm going to remind them of this last week, starting with stocks falling at negative 666. Lol, that'll NEVER get old!

5780 2018-02-09 10:52:50 We need to discover today is money flow.  Back into bonds, mkt, commodities? Where it goes nobody knows.  Eventually will go into PM stocks.
5781 2018-02-09 10:52:50 I'd disagree there. Education is a wealth generating asset. In that you can capitalise on it without reducing your stocks of it. Other asset classes like Bitcoin are more of a store of value, once you sell it then it's gone.
5782 2018-02-09 10:52:12 That sounds like the modern equivalent of a day in the stocks...

5803 2018-02-09 10:37:27 Alternately - stocks represent a right to receive a series of future cash flows (dividends). The stock price can be viewed as the discounted value of those future cash flows. Higher expected interest rates imply greater discounting and a lower share price.

5806 2018-02-09 10:36:28 Sure -- worse for some better for others. Depends on which stocks they've got.
5807 2018-02-09 10:36:24 For 15 years I've let stocks settle, let the range tighten on falling volume . Once the base is created its easier to manage risk and eliminate whipsaw. Trade away, care factor is zero.

5817 2018-02-09 10:28:22 Yeah, I think some of this is related to expectations of Fed raising rates (although who knows with Powell?) that are seeping into the long end of the curve. Or it's inflation expectations which are the same thing in this case. Link btw stocks and bonds not obvious here.

5854 2018-02-09 10:02:50 Such patterns may exist, both in stocks or inflation. I believe the main reason behind this fall is the end of the bullish market for awhile. The best thing for BTC is its price to be stabilized after this downturn, which make it a trustworthy and non-volatile investment/currency

5889 2018-02-09 09:36:25 that are not stocks. We are talking about one new philosophy,a new technological revolution. Newspapers want to make people to think about crypto is the same that stock market,but crypto is  one new market, created by users that believe in Satoshi philosophy. Free market.
5890 2018-02-09 09:36:15 De toute façon Newrest est loin d'être connue pour ses pratiques vertueuses en terme de personnel et de stocks. Il suffit que le personnel ait une pression du chiffre (ça expliquerait le racollage au micro plusieurs fois par trajet) pour que ce genre de déconvenue 
 arrive :/

5892 2018-02-09 09:34:17 I'm not too scared by 1) - DEXen would be a way out. But I think you are missing "rising interest rates" - if central banks hike rates, both stocks and crypto will deflate

5902 2018-02-09 09:30:27 would love to see more intraday charts of stocks you've traded with trade entries & exits. easy enough to figure out the why's if can see the when & where's on the chart.
5903 2018-02-09 09:29:46 Mr Porinju, pls don't encourage anyone buying Healthcare stocks. As a doctor I m requesting. This has already destroyed healthcare. Health shud never be a business. A stock holder wishes the prices go up but he will only pay in multiples if he falls ill.
5904 2018-02-09 09:29:32 Markets calm as US equity futures lead the way European stocks may be down, but investors are looking more cautious than panicking
European equities are slightly lower on the day, almost flat in fact right now as investors see no need to panic just yet.
5905 2018-02-09 09:25:58 @MarketSwingPlay  I enjoy following you. I haven't found another Trader that talk like this! You shown me how to "Play the Game not the Stocks" Now the manipulating is FUN!  I'm enjoying the market and not bitter anymore
5906 2018-02-09 09:25:40 Stocks are still paper claims on a real asset denominated in a potentially worthless fiat currency. Your stock certificates could be encumbered by securities lending. Markets might close down for extended periods. Wealth is a mirage.

5908 2018-02-09 09:25:06 @ThinkingUSD I've been thinking the same. I would imagine that we'll see crypto trading become more similar to traditional stocks. My only hope is that it will still retain a large amount of its volume/volatility.
5909 2018-02-09 09:24:28 arrrrg, shorting stocks...
but yea.
5910 2018-02-09 09:22:52 The UK had a choice: 

• Keep overfishing and destroy the stocks, so lose the whole industry, or...
• Limit fishing, shrink the fleet, but save something

We limited. So did countries around the world. Global, voluntarily, NOT the EU. You've been misinformed. 2/2
5911 2018-02-09 09:22:22 I’m not sure if people don’t realize or don’t know, many investors own individual stocks not just the $SPY so that little correction back to November levels probably means a lot worse for many individual names.
5912 2018-02-09 09:21:18 Most of US stocks are still very expensive even if we have these kind of sell-off. I still believe fair vaule of DOW is 20,000 & S&P 2200 if there will be no recession. if recession comes, Dow should trade below 20,000

5915 2018-02-09 09:15:37 EU quotas had a lot of problems, but at least they enabled fishing stocks to increase again.
And that's a fact. Not opinion.
Our fishing industry was on the way out well before 1973, like the rest of our industries. No investment, outdated small craft.

5918 2018-02-09 09:11:33 Stock markets tend to go down when economy data is so good. 
Because it anticipate economy will change to next downturn. How come everyone in Bloomberg say economy is good, so buy stocks. 
Good economy now = bad economy in the future

5922 2018-02-09 09:07:56 So 'trendy' assets are falling in lockstep - EM currencies, global stocks, crude oil, crpytos. Yields in China and US bonds are rising. Forget the safe haven plays for now.

6152 2018-02-09 07:08:24 Stocks were overpriced because there aren’t enough places for people to put their money. We’re in a new age of monopolies. Someday, maybe, there will be two companies that do everything and shares will cost a million dollars each.

6199 2018-02-09 06:45:24 Agreed. VIX is probably going to make a lower high and most of the overbought indices such as MXEF, NKY, HK, S&P500 are now very close of strong supports (200d). will be buying some stocks soon. But big risk we are now in a A/B/C type correction that will last months

6203 2018-02-09 06:40:28 Midcaps and smallcaps have been falling since 18th January.. it's been almost 20 days and the stocks were down almost 20-30 percnt from their recent highs.. I think it's enough for them. Time has come to start bottom fishing but slowly and steadily. No need to hurry..
6204 2018-02-09 06:40:20 The #StockMarket is collapsing because of #volatility caused by synthetic derivatives. 90% of trades are not even in actual stocks anymore. But they will have you believing it's due to inflation fears from "rising wages."
6205 2018-02-09 06:39:40 The Zim figure is not really a real indicator of the permanent perfomance of the ZSE, its just people running away from inflation and currency uncertainties and insecurities to find refugee in stocks. If everything normalise the figure will go down abundantly.
6206 2018-02-09 06:39:02 100% that's too much risk on crypto. Cryptos are like mining stocks- mines run out (I think there's 3 million Bitcoins left to mine & it's only been 10 years) that's why it's not wise to make mining stocks long term. Blockchain is not a tech for currencies, it's trend/bubble.

6292 2018-02-09 05:54:05 lady to me: I own 50 stocks to lower risk 

Me: behenji..then by that logic you must have 9 kids...3 will be brilliant..3 average..3 useless

She: nonsense ! 9 is unmanageable..I'm happy with 2 kids & I will ensure that both excel in life

Me: same logic works for ur stocks 
6293 2018-02-09 05:53:57 The oligarchs are doing well despite the plunge in the stock mkt. The rest of us? Not so much. Especially if we own any stocks.Pension funds will be or already are in trouble. Kinda like 2008. Hope I’m wrong.
6294 2018-02-09 05:53:43 Real stocks are supposed to go up over time ! Not this one as We all should’ve listened to a public servant say short it on tv ! Should be in jail ! He needs his ass beat !

6301 2018-02-09 05:49:03 I hate to tell you this, but your stocks are going dow fast, very soon, and also, middle class people get most of their income from wages/salary, so if you're living on investments, you're not middle class, you're rich.
6302 2018-02-09 05:49:02 Large difference between corporate and personal debt.

Large difference between personal debt collateralized on real asset (house) vs depreciating asset (car) vs volatile asset (stocks, crypto).

HUGE difference between non-dischargable debt (student) vs anything else.

6316 2018-02-09 05:43:48 was the @gop plain to bury the story of Trumps wife beaters (plural) and stocks tanking by just straight up shutting down the government? That is some next level shit.

6317 2018-02-09 05:43:41 I'll take the bet.  What have you got to offer?  Cash, stocks, bonds?
6318 2018-02-09 05:43:11 GUO YIN UNITY stocks climb despite troubling geopolitical headlines
6319 2018-02-09 05:43:06 True. Only some stocks i see are down by more than 5%. Rest are down by just 1-2%
6320 2018-02-09 05:42:28 Economy is booming. Tax cut. Paychecks and  social security checks bigger.  Stocks and 401  plans doing great.  Unemployment down.  Plenty of jobs.  America is great thank you President Trump.
6321 2018-02-09 05:41:58 Economy's still strong, stock market just taking a beating because that strong economy is (finally) hinting at inflationary pressures, meaning the Fed may have to be more aggressive, boosting bond yields & cutting attraction of stocks.
6322 2018-02-09 05:41:48 How will that be compensated? It probably wont. Trade stocks or forex if you want a regulated market.
6323 2018-02-09 05:40:43 Government shutdown, stocks crashed, a wife beater without security clearance handles top secret docs, a out-of-control General guides the Pres, and the moron wants a parade.  No wonder I can’t sleep. Our country is besieged.
6324 2018-02-09 05:40:37 I know all his reasons. ‘We are not only overweight on financials but obese over financials’, ‘bond yields’ and a few others. People can justify everything in this world, even rapes and murders. Ps- I dont own lot of financials, i have only 2/20 stocks from this field.
6325 2018-02-09 05:40:26 Not really a bloodbath today. Lot many stocks still trading in positive

6328 2018-02-09 05:40:16 The economy is great. Best economy. Tremendous economy. My stocks may have gone down, but dogecoin is holding steady at $0.0044, which I'd say is a win.
6329 2018-02-09 05:38:51 I have some #baba stocks at $204, today is $173, do I have to sell, stand or buy some more...? #helpme

6331 2018-02-09 05:37:05 Rip my stocks
6332 2018-02-09 05:36:29 Since I'm now divorced, I don't have to worry about some jerk taking my money. I'm currently addicted to investing in stocks. Which is kind of the same thing...
6333 2018-02-09 05:35:46 Inspiration came from your "Investing In Consumer Stocks To Hedge Against Lifestyle Costs" post! Really effective at reducing how much McD's I ate, that's for sure!
6334 2018-02-09 05:35:37 Great line by @shyamsek on ET Now today : 
' Investors are buying stocks based on how much they have fallen from their highs.Thats a disastrous way to invest in midcaps/smallcaps'
6335 2018-02-09 05:35:30 Moving money out of stocks means selling shares. If more people are selling than buying, the share price falls. As share prices fall, stocks appear even riskier and people move money into safer bets... earning interest.
6336 2018-02-09 05:35:21 Congress missed the update, money will be flooding away from stocks in the coming days. Bitcoin is a safe haven.. #btc #senate #Congress #trump #bitcoin
6337 2018-02-09 05:35:10 @MoonCaller I have no earthly idea, seen some $40 China stocks go to zero because of fraud
6338 2018-02-09 05:33:21 I think that's a good point FF . From politics to stocks the debate has become more juvenile and intolerant of a contrary opinion.

That's a dangerous attitude to have if you're investing in specs . Personally I'm always looking for reasons why I might be wrong
6339 2018-02-09 05:32:55 There’s another, more benign theory. As interest rates rise, lending money (or putting it into a bank so they can lend it) becomes more attractive. People move money out of riskier bets (stocks) and into safer bets (loans and savings).
6340 2018-02-09 05:32:50 oh hell yeah...that's my kinda talk!! Many peeps are already waiting to pounce on anything below .09c so let shorty push it if they dare but the Bull Crack Back will be fierce.
6341 2018-02-09 05:32:40 Congratulations to @Twitter for posting their first-ever profits and for their stocks passing $30 -- two days AFTER I sold mine.

6344 2018-02-09 05:32:06 V important to know Federal Reserve decided to broadcast live its coming meetings, signalling an interest rates rise is imminent any time soon, stocks will fall till fair values before another rally

6347 2018-02-09 05:30:31 “There is a 97% positive correlation between the past six years in the gold/SPX ratio and that earlier 6-year period,” he explained. “In fact, it now looks like the gold/stocks ratio could have some serious catching up to do to the upside.”
6348 2018-02-09 05:30:15 Luckily for me, I don't have any money or stocks in this market.  The worst yet to come?
6349 2018-02-09 05:30:13 Just because he might not invest in the market doesn't mean he doesn't know it. Plus King doesn't only write horror he writes sci fi and fiction. Also Trump shouldnt Be boasting that stocks doing great are cuz of him because stocks are always going up and down
6350 2018-02-09 05:30:11 Asian stocks plunge again after latest U.S. sell-off
6351 2018-02-09 05:29:23 Mr. President, Thank you for the stock market correction! Time for anyone who is smart to invest in America. Stocks that were overpriced are a bargain and it is a buying market, time for the little people to hit it big! Buy! Buy! Buy! I am in it!
6352 2018-02-09 05:29:21 I don't have any stocks/no interaction with the stock market.
6353 2018-02-09 05:28:32 Second Government shutdown, stocks falling like crazy. Yeah were a shithole country.

6357 2018-02-09 05:26:50 Stocks are correcting because we have had 15 months of almost straight up since the election. Talking heads can blame whatever they want. Bull market is not done!
6358 2018-02-09 05:26:49 Unless you've got the entirety of your investments in short term stocks (which is dumb), there's really not a reason to worry.

6366 2018-02-09 05:24:05 Stocks went on sale. 10% off! Hurry!
6367 2018-02-09 05:23:20 Stocks =! Economy. The market was overvalued, panic computer-traded selloffs tanked it. We've also gotten used to low interest rates, so any time there's even a hint that the Fed will raise them, it upsets the market. Also, traders are moving *to* bonds b/c of interest rates.
6368 2018-02-09 05:22:58 I am seeing a lot of unhealthy charts amongst the leading stocks that indicates distribution. The market crack in the past week is bieng validated by the unhealthy charts of the  leaders so this is definitely not a market to be long in.
Capital preservation is paramount.

6374 2018-02-09 05:21:05 I know that Trump has tied the success of the market to himself, as though he’s done something wonderful to make stocks go up. And yet, after today, the market is right back where it was before the tax cuts passed. Also, he inherited this economy & his jobs numbers aren’t better.
6375 2018-02-09 05:20:48 Wonder how many short order stocks they have placed already...
6376 2018-02-09 05:20:18 Eric Trump know as much about stocks as my toaster

6380 2018-02-09 05:19:03 And snack stocks rejoice
6381 2018-02-09 05:18:21 And y'all wonder why stocks are tumbling. But hey what do I know. It's not like there are correlations here or anything. Especially when the massive sell off of US bonds are happening. But I digress. What do I know.
6382 2018-02-09 05:18:07 the reason the stock market is so volatile is because the SEC changed the uptic rule in 2008,big hedge funds can now short a stock on a down tick therefore driving individual stocks way down....we need the rule changed so they can only short a stock on an uptic...
6383 2018-02-09 05:18:07 Can someone teach me how to trade? I want to get into penny stocks
6384 2018-02-09 05:17:58 How about a watchlist on the stocks that you have and/or want in the future
6385 2018-02-09 05:17:32 And once again the better smaller stocks shining like a beacon today.

Just some patience to allow things to settle down and we're going to see some really sweet moves

6390 2018-02-09 05:15:42 Re: tax reform- if your business model includes consumption by US workers, the best case is for *you* to use tax savings on stock holders and *other companies* to use them to raise wages. If everyone puts it in stocks, net impact is zilch.
6391 2018-02-09 05:15:34 The President recently said that stocks are making a big mistake because the economy is doing great.

Show of hands... 

Who remembers that stocks peak on good news & bottom on bad news? 

When the price of an asset refuses to rise on good news, something else is happening. $SPY

6393 2018-02-09 05:15:11 Dear @AnanthKumar_BJP  & @JPNadda ; many outlets in B'luru run out of stocks of many essential medicines. Replenishments takes lot of time. Make sure the drugs available on time.
6394 2018-02-09 05:15:02 Ok Nancy we get it. You got some inside info  and bought some dreamer stocks. WTF could your obsession with dreamers over Americans really be about.
6395 2018-02-09 05:14:30 $TLT breaking below its multi year support is a concern, but has to fall alot more to scare the rest of the market IMO. Rising rates don't create recessions immediately, so its probably stock markets adjusting to the recent quick rate increases IMO #stocks
6396 2018-02-09 05:14:21 Is Stock Market a Bubble? Crypto and Stocks may have more in common than previously thought. Possibly cash out Stocks and pump into Crypto Currencies, I mean we just had about a -63% + DIP. Also preparing for FED to raise rates yet again to try to stop people from spending money.

6400 2018-02-09 05:12:21 So as of now you are 100% out of both crypto and stocks?
6401 2018-02-09 05:11:32 yes bad dividend stocks finally got a hint of competition
6402 2018-02-09 05:11:27 The way I understand it, the stock market is going down because the government increased the interest rate it pays on it's bonds to entice people to buy them. It needs to sell more bonds to cover the new deficit. With better interest on bonds they're more appealing than stocks
6403 2018-02-09 05:11:16 stocks are down, govt is partially shutdown (again), & you want to play military parade. Maybe stop focusing on a woman who isn’t president & do the job that 46.1% of Americans voted you to do #StateofOurUnion #TrumpCrash #shutdown

6408 2018-02-09 05:07:03 all is well unless you own stocks, a little rise has tremendous influence on stock valuations
6409 2018-02-09 05:06:16 Well...a 10% stock market correction so far this past week, but it doesn't look like anything more than the relief valve popping off after such a hot run-up of stocks this past year.

6414 2018-02-09 05:04:44 interest rates that are rising are understandable, but when the 10-year get up toward 3%, i can see why folks are dumping stocks for treasuries. it's the safe thing to do with high stock market valuations.

6417 2018-02-09 05:03:04 Make note of all stocks that are in the green today despite the melt down in major indices... they are likely to be out-performers in the next move up...
6418 2018-02-09 05:00:53 On January 16, 171 stocks in the S&P 500 made a new high, the most in five years. 

Today, zero did.
6419 2018-02-09 05:00:48 .@DonLemon_CNN just broke the dumb meter saying some analysts are worried stocks are entering a bull market. Bull is a market going up. Bear markets go down. #WallStreet #learnbeforegoinglive
6420 2018-02-09 05:00:07 @BillOReilly Hi Bill long time fan of yours. I wonder if the Liberal Left could be causing the stock market swings by somehow manipulating the programmed selling and buying of stocks. Just saying??
6421 2018-02-09 04:59:32 Because of the stimulus from the expectation of the huge tax cut. And, of course, since the stimulus is coming during a boom time, it's likely to lead to inflation and that's why the Fed is preparing to hike interest rates, which is why stocks just did a significant correction...

6439 2018-02-09 04:46:44 Hey #Kimmel....I don’t believe ANYONE in your audience, who deals with stocks or has a 401K is bitching. Yes, the stock wasn’t great this week. It will self correct. Things are still at an #AllTimeHigh. Get over yoursel. Oh, are you going to do the debate or not?
6440 2018-02-09 04:46:20 “Holding stocks at this time is very brutal”. What’s he scared of a little dip? Yaw I know you know better.  This guy should read something !
6441 2018-02-09 04:46:04 Yes true. BTW be mindful of trading volume. This is a very good indicator to separate correction/something worse. Very good indication if you are looking at individual stocks.
6442 2018-02-09 04:45:48 Have a daytrade watchlist named Chineese Burritos since about 2010. Filled of pos stocks that make 20% plus moves for no reason half the time, keeps life interesting trading them . Thanks!
6443 2018-02-09 04:45:14 This is a Chronicle of the absurdity of the market before, during and after the crashes that are to come.  Junk assets and overvaluation is everywhere, no place more so than in crypto-currencies, and the blockchain penny stocks that are somehow listed on exchanges (e.g.Reg A+).
6444 2018-02-09 04:44:39 People are led to believe stocks are the best path to an early retirement, but that isn't true for most people. Investing in stocks mainly benefits the companies who get to use your cash and the banks who lend them money and get paid first if they fail. #BullShit (1/2)
6445 2018-02-09 04:43:41 This is a really good time to buy stocks if you're interested. Worth it in comparison to investing on bitcoin and cryptocurrency
6446 2018-02-09 04:43:21 So, is it better to sell everything in markets downtrending. Or hold real stocks, and do nothing.
6447 2018-02-09 04:43:12 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to treat your autism
6448 2018-02-09 04:43:12 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses
6449 2018-02-09 04:42:33 If I buy stocks on Smith’s tip I must sell those same stocks on Smith’s tip.  I am depending on him.  Suppose Smith is away on a holiday when the selling time comes around?

6466 2018-02-09 04:35:10 Well Trump said a lot of things that turned out to be lies. Like that he would take on corruption in the pharmaceutical industry. Except that now it cost a Type 1 diabetic $800 a month for insulin. Yet all he talks about is stocks & immigration to gloss over corporate monopolies.
6467 2018-02-09 04:35:06 Oh yeah poor thing. She’s a stick  that baby needs some biscuits
6468 2018-02-09 04:34:45 Over investment in stocks has led to overpricing and terrible deposit rates. Public shouldn't place money in bad investments. Companies will then crawl to banks for help. Rates will rise as banks need more money to loan and then the banks take the risk. @federalreserve #BullShit

6472 2018-02-09 04:33:01 I've traded stocks on multiple international platforms. The thing is, all of those platforms get down time when their stock markets are closed and nobody cares if they do maintenance. They all had to shut down orders to do maintenance. Keeping open 24/7 must be really difficult.
6473 2018-02-09 04:32:57 Will go down, but have strong support for many good stocks which can go up

6475 2018-02-09 04:31:00 @KylerNielsen Trumps tax cuts significantly increases the deficit.  His trade policy has the trade deficit highest since 2008.  The current budget deal also is additive to deficit which will be about 1.5 trillion shortly.   Of course interest rates will rise and stocks collapse.
6476 2018-02-09 04:30:38 They are so funny......up stocks because of Obama and down is TRUMPS. LOL. They are still double of what they were when OBoma left.

6482 2018-02-09 04:28:33 If that’s the best you’ve got.  outside of stocks, you’ve got Mnuchin destroying the value of the dollar and the growth is being stunted by the new Fed chairman. Stocks are a reflection of consumer confidence and business hubris. But the whole picture is grim.
6483 2018-02-09 04:28:24 Yeah if you have @Snap stocks I’d divest as soon as possible
6484 2018-02-09 04:26:48 I been trading stocks for a while, and I suck
6485 2018-02-09 04:26:34 I agree on that.  Support the small business, those that are part of us.  Boycott those that support the current trend of democratic decline.  Boycott the corporations.  Divest of stocks if you have them.  Keep your funds in cash as much as possible.  Hit them where it hurts most
6486 2018-02-09 04:26:28 Really pissed that i ordered my capture card to be told the supplier no longer stocks it. Then get stuffed around for a few days trying to get a different one to be told the same thing on multiple other cards, then have to pay more for a different one. @MwaveAu
6487 2018-02-09 04:25:24 True. Rally in many stocks had gone out of proportions. This will keep people sane.
