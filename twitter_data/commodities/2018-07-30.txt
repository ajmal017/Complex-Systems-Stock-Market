1 2018-07-30 23:42:10 Yup. Some jobs saved. Many more at risk. Higher prices for many commodities, even your favorite coca-cola. Was it all worth it?!

8 2018-07-30 22:47:08 We think they are commodities because they are commodities.

11 2018-07-30 22:23:34 I know that wages have stagnated when inflation is factored in and I know Americans spend more than any country on non-durable commodities and fast food. Believe me, I'll stay up North, no way I would raise my kids in such a dangerous and unequal country.
12 2018-07-30 22:14:49 Hard when prices are increasing in commodities and wages are stagnated.
13 2018-07-30 22:14:04 Sure. @realDonaldTrump wants to take care of his rich family and friends at the expense of everyone else. Wages are flat and Trump’s Tariffs will make food and other commodities pricier. But hey, as long as the rich are happy...
14 2018-07-30 22:05:01 I think the point being made is that this is perhaps just one example of many where everyday commodities which we enjoy and take for granted may not be available.   Did leavers vote for this?
15 2018-07-30 22:03:39 where identity groups are increasingly, thru marketing culture, tied to consumption to the point where a queer person (arbitrary example) might be ostracized from their group for not consuming or wearing media/commodities affiliated with that group.
16 2018-07-30 22:01:31 No need, we are comfortable with broomstick. Pls try to reduce tax rates on daily commodities which are used by middle class consumers..
17 2018-07-30 21:49:21 You wouldn’t expect them to be sobbing openly in the corridor would you?? I sincerely hope for Roquan and the team and the fans it gets sorted but I imagine they’ll be making contingency plans if they have to. Players are/have unfortunately become commodities in all sports.

38 2018-07-30 21:43:52 We have to...just look at what's China doing in Africa. Especially now that the trade wars have begun. Mineral commodities is sure to rise.
39 2018-07-30 21:31:27 Não é tão simples. Pessoas escravizadas no Brasil (e nos EUA) viravam commodities. No Brasil se tinha posse de pessoas, faziam negócio com sua vida e geravam riquezas tendo gente como propriedade. Foram **milhões** trazidos e só foi possível pq até com religião justificavam!
40 2018-07-30 21:30:37 Gallatin/1832: "Foreign commerce or the exchange of domestic for foreign commodities is of the same nature, and founded on the same principle, as commerce between different parts of the same country or that between individuals of the same district of country."
41 2018-07-30 21:21:01 When will foot pics be traded on the New York Stock Exchange as commodities
42 2018-07-30 21:17:37 Absolutely. I think you folks on the coasts think we need you more than you need us. We can split anytime... Flyover Country will be just fine. We have vital commodities and products to sell to highest bidder(s). We will be just fine!
43 2018-07-30 21:14:00 It's very sad, as animals should not be commodities that wear out after a while to be thrown away. Saw an advert for a puppy a girl wanted to "rehome" after buying him and stated she'd had him ONE night. decided decided a puppy is not right for her household...

46 2018-07-30 21:12:07 @hellogames Had high hopes for the NEXT update, but very disappointed with it. Freighter fuel is broken, refiner bugs out often, systems no longer produce trade commodities? Quests have broken coding lines plus sometimes give standing for the wrong race?
47 2018-07-30 21:05:37 The only thing holding up the US economy is the US Dollar being the worlds reserve currency for oil , having a monopoly on ALL OIL SALES. Our top ten exports are resource commodities. Economically we are a third world nation Wolf at the Gate .
48 2018-07-30 20:55:27 Its natural Tory progression Michelle. Grab as much money from as many sick and disabled through benefit cuts is a short jump to profiting from theyr healthcare.

People and theyr health are all nothing but commodities and poundsigns in Tory eyes.
49 2018-07-30 20:52:51 The rarest commodities in this world we inhabit are:

51 2018-07-30 20:44:32 And yet Australia has sent refugees to Cambodia under an MOU between both governments. Being a signatory to the #refugee convention is not enough to deliver meaningful protection. # refugees are not commodities.
52 2018-07-30 20:43:36 Why arent people calling ether digital oil yet ? We are yet to discover digital equivalents of many commodities.
53 2018-07-30 20:43:24 Is that actually true? I know there were many farm projects. But I understand there were scarcities too. Were the scarce commodities limited to things that weren’t produced in the UK? And how has that changed? What was supplied from local sources that no longer is available?
54 2018-07-30 20:42:24 Maqbooza media just comprises a tiny percentage; The rest are just commodities to be bought. Remembering the dharna and how media was covering it 24/7 and building a narrative which has culminated in what we are facing now.
55 2018-07-30 20:37:49 WB can't afford the backlash of losing Henry. I don't get why they won't play ball, *especially* now that Henry and McQuarrie are hot commodities and are basically giving them dibs. They can't be that stupid, can they?
56 2018-07-30 20:37:22 It's also worth noting that 85% of all stocks are owned by the top 1%. Most of the 4.1% this quarter can be attributed to stock buy-backs & foreign countries stocking up on commodities before tariffs take effect. Next quarter will be dire.
57 2018-07-30 20:15:08 Women are often seen as commodities &  judged in superficial ways. Many women internalize it. Had Lena Headey told the creep off, she would most likely have been called a bitch for defending herself. Lena is a fabulous actress in every role I've seen her play. Focus on her talent
58 2018-07-30 20:01:52 Weekly Crop Progress Report:
Corn is 72% G/E, unchanged from last week
Beans are 70% G/E, same as last week but G+1 and E-1
59 2018-07-30 19:58:01 So you provide no explanation. If Americans are more productive than Chinese why is China's economy growing at a phenomenal rate? Why are they the ones producing most commodities, why are american companies willing to go to less productive places?
60 2018-07-30 19:57:09 republicans and others are still marrying their cousins.  Women are pawns..commodities ... and help-mates in a solidly entrenched aspect of American culture
61 2018-07-30 19:55:50 Speaking of transnet; apart from the fact tht trains were designed to transport systematically located black people to their colonizers places for “work”. Transnet is the largest transporter of commodities; coal, gold etc and we all know who owns mines... definitely not our kind
62 2018-07-30 19:46:56 The Chinese currency now trades oil and ten other commodities with Russia and other major trading nations. Around 2022 the CHINESE WILL CONTROL THE SHIPPING LANES WITH THEIR NAVY. Usually when the Navy takes control of the shipping lanes the RISING POWER TAKES OVER!..
63 2018-07-30 19:42:58 We’re not gonna mention the commodities fire sale that propped up these numbers as American producers try to beat crippling tariffs?
64 2018-07-30 19:41:31 I do fine, I don't make $50,000 in a day, but I do just fine. I trade FOR REAL. I also trade real companies and commodities not these money sucking scams. I try to help people not fall for these scams, because I fell for multiple when I was a brand new trader? Is that so bad?
65 2018-07-30 19:35:09 Taxing commodities like steel using tariffs picks steel producers as 'potential' winners, but Only If their customers are willing and able to pay for the price spike.  Inevitable retaliation is a misery adder.
Apparently this is too hard to understand for this administration.
66 2018-07-30 19:24:58 @adsteel I love watching you. Your cool and chill and super intelligent. Keep up the amazing work, there’s no commodities without Steel 
67 2018-07-30 19:16:09 That said, I did go to the Old Slave Mart Museum in Charleston. Every white person who ooh & aahs (and I’m one) for the amazing homes there should also go stand in the 4 walls of a place where Black lives were commodities to support those lifestyles.
68 2018-07-30 19:12:06 #TrumpSupporters The “strong” economy that we have is due in large part to other countries buying up American commodities before the tariffs were put in place. Next quarter, it’ll collapse, & next year it’ll get worse when we enter into a $1 trillion plus budget deficit.

73 2018-07-30 18:31:54 I think it's important to remark what Aciman said in an interview: he wanted to set #cmbyn during the 80s because it was a time when none of the commodities and devices we have today would have interfered with living emotions, feelings, moments, life to the fullest!

86 2018-07-30 17:25:01 Well, we are likely to become a net energy exporter, but we will always import some energy commodities (i.e. crude) and the price for internationally traded energy commodities in the U.S. will always be linked to the rest of the world. So what does independence really mean?

117 2018-07-30 15:40:25 2. Focusing on mass-scale animal suffering as its own issue--the notion of sentient beings becoming commodities is compelling to racial justice activists without having to say "it's just like slavery."
118 2018-07-30 15:34:39 Large biz hedge their crop prices on the commodities markets. Now, with Trump’s bail out, big Corp. agriculture will reap another windfall, & at low Corp tax rates. More $ for the 1/10%.

This is why tax cuts & bail outs need to be precisely targeted. Trump’s are just give aways.
119 2018-07-30 15:32:52 Due to divergence in the indices today; Russel pushing up, and Nasdaq pushing down, we are holding off on a trade plan this afternoon. Not much action in the commodities we look at either. #inthefutures #futures

122 2018-07-30 15:17:05 Kuwait got rescued from Sadaam Hussein by who? The ME oil is a commodity. To see how economies based on commodities fare in the long run, take on a tour of the ghost towns in the US's far west.

123 2018-07-30 15:05:00 There are some highly placed individuals at my company (entertainment industry) who have psych degrees, and they do very well. And my best friend since grade school has one and was a successful commodities analyst who retired young. So it's not just polling careers.

140 2018-07-30 13:44:55 Commodities/oil the only market in the world where the biggest buyer is forced to use the currency of a rival (& possible enemy) to pay for commodities.  Perhaps this situation will persist forever.  Seems unlikely, esp since China's moving aggressively to end it.

213 2018-07-30 03:53:05 The point of my comment was that BHP split off the assets from the core company at a low point in the market for the commodities it was casting off, which have since risen. Obviously, if you were a BHP shareholder who retained their S32 shares it didn't matter, other than costs.

215 2018-07-30 03:42:25 "Men get passes. Women get reputations." 

You've seen it in your classes. You've seen it in your churches, on the news. Call it what it is. It's sexism. It's "purity" culture, it's how we nake wome. "behave" and how we keep them  as commodities. It's wrong.
216 2018-07-30 03:20:36 They don’t control commodities markets just because they buy a lot. No one is stashing the Yuan when they know they won’t know the value of it from day to day. We have Nike’s as well...so I’m not sure the leverage here

218 2018-07-30 03:12:39 come on professor you know the answer to that. a worker is a commodity and, like all commodities, it is worth the cost of its production. a high school drop-out's education is worth far less than a HS graduate. under capitalism workers are commodities, things for sale.
219 2018-07-30 03:11:24 However there will only be a few thousand positions that require those skills and several hundred thousand competing for them. This making such individuals commodities and pushing compensation to cost (or below).

222 2018-07-30 02:35:14 Control the physical supply of commodities & you can control the pricing of commodities.  Control the pricing of commodities (& have nuclear weapons) & you can make the USD weaker whenever it suits you.
223 2018-07-30 02:35:03 In a Marx tradition, when other commodities are traded for gold, it is the direct exchange of one product of labor, with a different product of labor.  When commodities are traded for fiat, it is an exchange of a product of labor with a product of legislative/banker fiat.
224 2018-07-30 02:30:11 So they are making the assumption that the dollar will be weaker when they pay the bonds back? So they’re arbitraging the strong dollars they have to buy commodities, at low prices? That kind of buying would still boost commodities prices quickly negating the plan, no!
225 2018-07-30 02:24:49 They’re borrowing (shorting) massive amounts of USD to buy commodities with the USD price of commodities relative to financial assets at 100+ yr lows, & if they can change pricing/settlement of said commodities into CNY, it will likely be quite easy to “cover their USD short”.
226 2018-07-30 02:21:16 Beef and Pork were the only commodities not affected, and govt spent years attacking them falsely as the cause of heart disease.  Chicken which is controlled by a few major corps of course was pushed as the one good choice.  All lies.
227 2018-07-30 02:15:13 "Unlocking value" is generally just management spin jargon. The reality was BHP thought they were low growth assets with little future so got rid of them via S32. As it turned out, the prices of many of those unwanted commodities rose and S32's share price rose with them.
228 2018-07-30 02:15:01 We’ve had large moves in rates, fx, equities, em, sovereign credit and commodities this year alone.. anyone saying that “macro hasn’t been working” is using it as a lame excuse for poor performance
229 2018-07-30 02:14:44 Sim, o Lula abriu as pernas pros bancos. O país realmente teve um bom avanço no primeiro mandato e primeira metade do segundo, mas isso se deve à bolha de commodities, que acabou estourando no colo da Dilma.
230 2018-07-30 01:56:18 I worked in the business world for 20 years, trading commodities and doing logistics and supply chain. So guess what? I know what I’m talking about.
231 2018-07-30 01:37:02 5G is going to sooo expensive so I'm sure at first it will be great for content creators, but as the companies start generating their CapX investments back they will do just like 4G, commodities & gimp plans.
232 2018-07-30 01:33:33 Yes I can. It’s a game, game I love. Has players that are compensated 10x more than teachers are at minimum. Who come and go each year.. they are disposable commodities, literally they are. That’s not a view or opinion it’s a fact. Your lack of vision for that is sad

234 2018-07-30 01:15:34 No, it’s not. It’s a 2005 move. It makes no sense to deal two high-end (yes, they are) position player prospects for a starting pitcher who doesn’t really move the needle when controllable, upside position players are more valuable commodities than pitching around the league.

236 2018-07-30 01:04:28 It's been revealed that the reality of #Brexit means that stockpiling of essential commodities is required.
To prepare for a full Brexit, Remainers are stockpiling bile, crocodile tears, spite and hateful venom.

239 2018-07-30 00:35:12 Music is one of our most exported Commodities(if I can call it that) in Nigeria. But listening to songs made from 2015-till now you will barely know we are battling hunger, hardship,massive unemployment bloodbath,oppression. You did think we were enjoying down here.
240 2018-07-30 00:28:26 Not if commodities keep doing ok, and further mass migration is pumped in via foreign students, skilled migration, temp visas etc. The stats will be fine.
241 2018-07-30 00:18:48 If you view policing, prosecutions, and punishment as public goods/social commodities those goods are allocated based on race of victim first. There is interesting scholarship about not diminishing those commodities but reallocating them.
