1 2018-12-12 23:58:01 Actually hes right...both #xvg and #tpay have the best potential. Xvg is the most heavily integrated privacy coin of all as of now. It also has the capability of being public allowing holders to charge companies to see their transactions if they so choose. Has a revenue stream.

13 2018-12-12 23:54:20 Is it illegal to mine bitcoin?  I seem to remember people had to mine the official crypto.  Is that correct.
14 2018-12-12 23:53:44 XRP is coming soon. We're testing it now. Credit card depositors will also be able to withdraw crypto in the future.

59 2018-12-12 23:48:36 yup, i think i moved all my crypto off exchanges in month 3 of getting into the space once my ledger arrived
60 2018-12-12 23:48:11 I threw 100k of my savings into crypto in early 2016. Down 96/97% from ath. Sucks. Only positive is since I went in heavy, if it recovers even just by half I'll be back in 7 figures.
61 2018-12-12 23:47:37 Tacos might be great for hunger, but only crypto can save countries from debt.
62 2018-12-12 23:47:27 BUT THATS DUE TO THE FACT THAT OUR MONEY IS BEING DUMPED INTO CRYPTO AND OUR STUFF FROM STORES LYFTED BY FREELOADERS WHO DONATED IT TO WHOMEVER????

64 2018-12-12 23:47:24 Question: in France, we had a "Rothschild" law in 1973, forbidding the French treasury to access funds from the French central bank, forcing it to borrow with interests from private banks, ballooning the debt since. Was a similar law passed at any time in the US?
65 2018-12-12 23:47:22 I agree with what you’re saying. I 100% believe in Tron

Obviously the DEX stuff is old news, but when it was happening, everyone turned a blind eye

Frankly, I’m just a little fed up with crypto blogs and the speculative content

86 2018-12-12 23:45:07 It appears transparent to you because you can't see anything that actually happens like the constant censorship/abuse of others.

136 2018-12-12 23:37:31 Semi-instant at best.. Sure, they take your payment instantly.. then lock your funds into a transaction.. but they take upto 21 days or more to settle the transaction.

I use them to help me map out the underlying structure of the market. Not much more. They are something I would take a trade on in a vacuum.

157 2018-12-12 23:34:38 @BrendanEich stated that BAT is a taste of UBI in a podcast he was on, which in my mind implies that UBI is inevitable. What is the #crypto community's thoughts on this? We will eventually have to create a currency specifically for UBI, correct?
158 2018-12-12 23:34:33 It’s cool to like another coin more than bitcoin, but if you are going to be involved in crypto & at the same time straight up hate on bitcoin you have the downs

208 2018-12-12 23:28:17 I think etoro customers maybe just dealt with it in silence. But not having control over your own crypto goes against the very nature of crypto. That’s why it is so irritating for some.

This crypto civil war is absolutely toxic.
215 2018-12-12 23:27:03 This is disgusting. tricking uninformed people into using their hardware for mining crypto for virtual pennies that expire in a year. What you would earn wouldn’t even equal a fraction of the increased electric bill. This is like modern day sharecropping targeted at kids

236 2018-12-12 23:24:52 Actually I will pick his letter to congress, he made many statements in that letter which are verifiably not true, but sent them anyway because he is emotionally attached to the outcome of seeing crypto fail
237 2018-12-12 23:24:42 1/ I understand what it is, and I believe that FOMO will start at almost the exact same time as every big FI is ready to go and as soon as all of the big platforms start to advertise.

259 2018-12-12 23:22:25 @KrownCryptoCave Yo Eric, I saw you on FUD TV and interested in your courses.  However, two things.  Which course plan should I really look at if I want to start day (short term plays) trading crypto?  What if I don’t like what I see in a month, can I cancel?  Thanks brotha!
260 2018-12-12 23:22:24 I have not been doing anything for months, I know you're completely oblivious to logic, facts or evidence. You're clearly projecting since it was adel/breck who have been non-stop attacking and spreading nonsense for months due to paranoia over their pcn-daps exit scam round #1
261 2018-12-12 23:21:47 Liquidity in crypto makes projects shit to 0 during the bear. look @goblockparty for example, it's trading around 1m cap...
262 2018-12-12 23:21:40 argumentum ad hominem - a personal attack on the person making an argument rather than attacking the argument itself. For example, if someone stated "Crime is on the rise", and someone responded with "No, it's not, because you're a stupid face!", that would qualify
263 2018-12-12 23:21:32 Yes please share your proof, we all curious 
264 2018-12-12 23:21:16 If you own the crypto why can't u take it & keep it safe in a wallet?That's clearly what everybody wants to do.People are frustrated because that's what they want to do. You are saying a wallet will come soon for over a year now.Your customers just want the truth, thats all. Fair

267 2018-12-12 23:21:06 When you buy crypto with confidence, you suposed to buy real crypto that you can do what you want with it
-move it, send it, sell it, give it
And so on
Even that one bought with credit card that also belongs to you
Not crypto for etoro deal as they want
268 2018-12-12 23:21:05 I have no involvement with Ondori, but Ondori was a fork-swap to a PIVX zPoS codebase, similar to many projects; they have their own vision/path. 

It is not a proven previous exit-scam turned erc-20-swap to enrich adel+breck like $pcn $daps was/is.
269 2018-12-12 23:20:56 やはりですか…
270 2018-12-12 23:20:55 It’s only because when crypto was going nuts $GRAT wanted to drop some stupid buzz words like “blockchain” “crypto” etc... now that those stocks are in the dump $GRAT just looks stupid.

296 2018-12-12 23:18:22 Unpopular bitcoiner opinion:  The world wants easily tradable digital tokens (shitcoins, securities, crypto kitties, etc.).  Ethereum has first mover advantage and network effects as a token platform.
297 2018-12-12 23:18:21 Imaginary crypto.
298 2018-12-12 23:18:21 With the flood of ICO’s seen in 2017 I can’t imagine the amount of BTC raised and the amount of BTC that is now being poured back into the market at all prices to fund the projects, suppressing the price. I think Sto’s will come with but not start or contribute to the bull run.
299 2018-12-12 23:18:13 How’s the ondori scam going for you? You managed to get more victims in? 
300 2018-12-12 23:18:10 No issues +0.1 @xrptipbot. I just think it is not realistic for anyone to take salary in crypto when they have recurring fixed obligations.
301 2018-12-12 23:18:10 They are patterns based on behaviour so they are never perfect. 

Human nature always skews the patterns. 

Trading is subjective and we all have our own interpretations.
302 2018-12-12 23:17:58 You have been yelling this utter nonsense for months now, and it has also been several months since this was disproved.

You really need help Anika. Please seek it, this has gone beyond ridiculous.

310 2018-12-12 23:17:00 By team of course I don't mean developers, since you have none. They hired an outsource team because all adel and breck are good for is exit scamming and conjuring up a plan for enrichment round #2 (erc-swap to mainnet)
311 2018-12-12 23:16:53 It mines crypto where you cannot cash out into FIAT and you cant even mine enough before your crypto "expires" making it literally a scam

320 2018-12-12 23:15:45 People believe what they want to believe. The entire premise of crypto isn't a lie if one is objective about its consequences (in tandem w/ its benefits). The idealists are going to be completely blindsided in the years to come.

326 2018-12-12 23:14:09 The ICO boom was responsible for the obsession with tokenizing every damn thing and labelling it a breakthrough crypto idea. If it doesn't deliver cost, user experience, speed or security benefits then it's not worth doing.

332 2018-12-12 23:13:40 It has not been disproved. There is plenty of evidence in Kratos' post ALONE which shows the SCAM intention and lack of professionalism in that "projects" lead scammers.

There is plenty MORE evidence that will circulate, if needed since daps' entire community is now a lie parrot
333 2018-12-12 23:13:40 @JordanLyall
334 2018-12-12 23:13:32 Doesn't look like much of a fight according to the crypto market cap. Should we all just keep waiting for decentralization to save us or could the crypto space use a political leader to offset clowns like this?

338 2018-12-12 23:13:08 She is right. Once I talked to a twitter employee and he told me that any mention of crypto currencies can get your account banned. I assume it is easier to target the handles that have this “crypto” in the name. “Blockchain” is fine though

353 2018-12-12 23:11:08 Airdrops of an erc-20 token (which may I add adel threatened the community that they may not even go ahead with the airdrop during their scam exit)

They decided to go ahead out of paranoia have now outsourced development so that they can enrich themselves for a second time

361 2018-12-12 23:09:46 Yes sir!
362 2018-12-12 23:09:45 People talk about accumulating $crypto at these deeply retraced levels for low risk, high rewards. 

But what about accumulating knowledge, wisdom, experience?

Same principle applies.

372 2018-12-12 23:08:31 How often do you pay those organisations and would you say that you calculate those costs in your monthly/yearly budget? Versus, how many people FOMO and buy crypto and then regret it when it drops 90%? Is the latter in your view then considered credit for credit?

433 2018-12-12 22:59:34 Oh now don't do that.
434 2018-12-12 22:59:26 Without no bullshit/skeptical Nocoiners and Bitcoin maximalists busting scams,

The crypto bubble would've grown bigger than the dot com bubble, more people would've got hurt, and regulators would be cracking down hard.

They're the unsung heroes self-policing this space.
435 2018-12-12 22:59:24 Ah non, les posts sur le chan de la fede crypto-anar viennent d’arriver sur beamstat, mais ca a pris vachement de temps. Donc a priori j’ai bien réussi a passer le sandboxing, mais bon… j’suis prudent. Je vois pas les images associées a mes posts sur beamstat.

440 2018-12-12 22:58:58 good
441 2018-12-12 22:58:55 Yes. I don't see any contradiction here. Bitcoin illustrates precisely the point I make. It's attractiveness has rested mainly on expectations that it would appreciate. But appreciation for a monetary standard means falling prices generally, too much of which is undesirable.
442 2018-12-12 22:58:53 good

What are you doing in Chicago? Any crypto meetups/events?

450 2018-12-12 22:58:28 Great work from @Nasdaq, VanEck’s @MVISIndices and @CryptoCompare. We work hard to help #Bitcoin & #crypto markets evolve to 2.0. offering greater transparency, financial-standard protections and the usual institutional quality features that we require in traditional markets.
451 2018-12-12 22:58:27 ...hope you'll talk about anarchy vs. crypto government compatibility - I think important at this very moment.
452 2018-12-12 22:58:03 #EUNO, it has been a hard year for all crypto followers. But you are my rising star is this dark times. 

$EUNO, do you know you're creators aren't done with you yet? You will be one of the biggest stars in crypto soon.

@EunoCoin, we will use you every day with our NFC phone.

456 2018-12-12 22:57:22 To my knowledge... stake your $tpay on your desktop wallet and input address on efin exchange for tracking.. there will be paid membership options which will affect the amount of $efin you will acquire... if that makes any sense lol
457 2018-12-12 22:57:21 My crypto friend, @CryptoVofficial dedicates himself only to #litecoin. So subscribe to his channel and gain some knowledge while your at it.
458 2018-12-12 22:57:18 Unfortunately the light under the tunnel may not come soon. I feel for you as I lost six figures in crypto. I believe crypto has more downside to drop but can surprise us all. Hopefully you can buy more at cheap prices. Best wishes
459 2018-12-12 22:57:16 Meh, mostly. You say some bullshit stuff too, come on now.
460 2018-12-12 22:57:02 Well I’ll be damned...

464 2018-12-12 22:56:21 The big question is why Nazi enemy combatants were not taken out when they broke into our country after WWII.  Too, why is the anarchist neo-Nazi white trash subversive movement that raises killers acceptable to you crypto-Nazi Republicans?
465 2018-12-12 22:56:18 I am good at making pp slides though. I'll show you. One sec
466 2018-12-12 22:56:05 Hey! What's going on here. 
467 2018-12-12 22:56:03 No, wasnt clear! 
If it was clear i wasnt here as others
And its not clear so far each time i bought crypto with credit card since you dont say that its impossible to send to wallet
Can you answer why dont allow crypto bought by credit card send to wallet?
468 2018-12-12 22:55:58 lolll there are definitely people that disagree lolll but i still got nothing but love for themn... 

I have been blessed enough to meet some incredible individuals on this CT journey which includes you Alain so I'm forever feeling blessed

473 2018-12-12 22:55:31 In other words the market is not distinguishing between various crypto assets so you have not benefited from the deflationary aspect yet.
474 2018-12-12 22:55:28 Funny cause it's true
475 2018-12-12 22:55:24 They wanna create a blockchain for the transactions of ALL graphene companies. Much different then a crypto currency itself
476 2018-12-12 22:55:00 Oh I know that you both come up with the content. And Euci is incredibly funny. I just could not pass up the opportunity to bust his balls
477 2018-12-12 22:54:38 If XRP is pipe dream, what crypto would you suggest?
478 2018-12-12 22:54:34 Actually i think so. 2018 was a bad year for the crypto market. We have seen how the crypto market went from a very high to bottom! But 2019 would be a good year for the crypto. 
I am very much interested to go forward with #TIOx token, this will be big in 2019

480 2018-12-12 22:54:08 good old Fox news... the news for old people so they can stay afraid of "those people"
481 2018-12-12 22:53:52 A good project with great potential in the future! It is high time to use the crypto currency in everyday life. I hope the developers will implement all the plans. #FanChain #SportsCastr $FANZ

484 2018-12-12 22:53:30 I like #ProofOfKeys, but I wonder if it will result in a "crypto bank run" _before_ January 3rd.

Like, if you already believe most exchanges are fractional, wouldn't you transfer all your Bitcoin to keys you control prior to January 3rd rather than risk getting burnt?
485 2018-12-12 22:53:29 @crypto_birb lol bro look at chart and people scammed for 1500 btc

488 2018-12-12 22:53:08 おはビーノ^^
489 2018-12-12 22:53:08 This was likely a response to a specific Q, but I’d even broaden it further. Most in the US don’t experience the pain of legacy systems that crypto can help solve (I.e. US banking isn’t perfect, but not SO bad everyone will quickly adopt crypto as an alternative right now).
490 2018-12-12 22:53:06 Maybe the opposite happens? Corporate giants getting taken over and injected with blockchain tech and crypto’s!
491 2018-12-12 22:53:04 Havent you heard mate? Crypto is DEAD
492 2018-12-12 22:53:02 It's fox news, so no worries. 
493 2018-12-12 22:52:53 its a question when youre the kind of guy who falls for crypto scams run by nazis
494 2018-12-12 22:52:31 this is harsh
495 2018-12-12 22:52:31 If Expedia wanted to accept crypto they would. That is the exact reason we need these new companys, to show the dinosaurs the door. That said there is nothing saying these startup need there own token, make a deal with an existing project and hit the ground running
496 2018-12-12 22:52:30 I got confused too.
497 2018-12-12 22:52:27 "You're only as good as your last trade." 

If your last trade was a loss, take a break (depending on the size of the loss) and come back to a high probability trade set up. 

Make sure the new "last trade" is a profitable one, no matter how small the profit.

508 2018-12-12 22:51:33 You cant say that one asset isn't deflationary, because another in its class can be created. You do realize that countries are using crypto today, where there has been problems with their local fiat.volatility doesn't matter, as the obligations change with the volatility.
509 2018-12-12 22:51:24 Oh well it's fox news so it's not a real story. Duh

533 2018-12-12 22:48:05 Good point. We're expanding, but it's more than just for crypto die hards.

We see a future where all financial assets will be represented by digital tokens and traded freely p2p on a blockchain.

This is the direction, these are the first steps.

544 2018-12-12 22:47:02 I don't have anything readily available to back my claim, but where and how is XRP the crypto, being used? I don't know anyone who uses it. Do you? What's the so called utility when Ripple themselves are scouting ideas to be able to use XRP?

547 2018-12-12 22:46:43 Bitcoin is open finance. None of the other "crypto" projects come close to being as open as bitcoin. Including other projects as open finance is misleading. It's like saying "we're for open finance and lots of less open systems."
548 2018-12-12 22:46:33 why is Razer making their own crypto currency lmaoooo
549 2018-12-12 22:46:31 They did on Iceland. And then banned crypto as well. Haven't heard anything from them in a while. Perhaps they banned internet as well.

559 2018-12-12 22:45:26 They maybe individually deflationary but in aggregate all cryptos are inflationary over the last 3 years . Once any crypto gains main stream adoption the deflationary aspect should help. Most would be killed by the volatility before they can enjoy the be benefits of adoption .

583 2018-12-12 22:42:40 Woah wait you can trade real crypto on etoro now, and move it to your own wallet for safekeeping?
584 2018-12-12 22:42:37 “Close your eyes and buy them... from the same guy that was pumping crypto 6-12 months ago”... how’s that going for BK!

606 2018-12-12 22:39:27 And to solve this is simple by etoro:
-giving people the chance to send crypto to wallet if bought by credit card
-giving chance to all clients send crypto to wallet (not only premium users)
-putting ASAP xrp in their wallet
I buy coins n etoro! I want to do with them what i want

618 2018-12-12 22:37:48 I’d humbly challenge both of these patterns. Cup with handle is a continuation pattern requiring the preceding trend to be up (<= 6 mths). Cont. H&S would need a small rally to be reversing (eg not sideways from low) & works better if head is smaller than shoulders (cont. only).

639 2018-12-12 22:35:40 Crypto is a bank/CIA psy-op for their cashless (666) society.  Be careful.  Look up Catherine Austin Fitts and what she says about it....psy-op.  Let smart people figure it out, then take control...  Happens all the time.  I agree it needs to be independent, but how.  Gold/s no.

Not unless a) we’re over 50k in b) we wire funds in equivalent to our initial debits. There are lots of other gripes.
We’re going round in circles and you’re obfuscating. You can sort this out if you want to Yoni.

Only the good stuff.
665 2018-12-12 22:31:32 Its not negative, its not misleading people:
-if they say we own the coins after sept 17, and we cannot move it nowere its not good
-if you buy crypto with credit card but they will block your funds cause only those bought with wire transfer are good to wallet, this is not good

677 2018-12-12 22:29:24 2019 CRYPTO is going to fucking suck 
678 2018-12-12 22:29:23 Perhaps, maybe.... 
But the right mentality is *anything can happen* ...
Not "this will never happen because reasons"
679 2018-12-12 22:29:18 1/2 I think pivoting entirely to new tech (crypto/blockchain/consciousness etc) and working on building ‘new worlds’ that are independent of government or class influence is a more reasonable move than trying to curtail the rise of socialism.
680 2018-12-12 22:29:13 Crypto currencies became a financial tool has the highest volatility but it is not related with blockchain technology and its benefits. We should consider about how we can benefit from the technology in our lives.
681 2018-12-12 22:29:11 We're gonna have a good time tomorrow crypto nephew! #OnTheSet
682 2018-12-12 22:29:07 Bakkt and Nasdaq are just the first. 

More stock exchanges will open up crypto exchanges to follow their lead

I expect even more global announcements in 2019
683 2018-12-12 22:29:06 Because you can withdraw your crypto from an exchange at any time and put them safely in a cold wallet that you control. The very idea that you cannot withdraw what you own is beyond logic.
684 2018-12-12 22:28:43 Crypto currencies should be valued with their benefits rather than the listed exchanges, such as scalability, sustainability and daily uses.
685 2018-12-12 22:28:42 Sweet!
686 2018-12-12 22:28:35 "This can't be real"
It definitely can, don't be in denial.
I'm sure that dozens of crypto projects are having amazing development and getting bigger communities.
But the price action will stay bearish until proven wrong, applies to every market.

695 2018-12-12 22:27:30 Pretty obvious as to why. 

These people lash out and attack others due to insecurities within themselves.
696 2018-12-12 22:27:30 A blockchain that has as much hashpower as one rig pretty much makes it a centralized and completely defeats the purpose of a blockchain (and it's just a copy-paste of bitcoin, which makes it an equivalent to a crappy testnet)

706 2018-12-12 22:26:28 It’s extremely difficult to advertise legitimate crypto projects (at least that’s been my experience).  I believe that’s because of the number of illegitimate ones. 

That’s got to change if we want to grow this space. 

How do you stop these projects without regulation?

734 2018-12-12 22:23:25 Hi @GeorgeSelgin, I just listened to your old podcast on @crypto_voices. You say that the deflationary nature of Bitcoin is bad, however you also say the people don’t act out of “what is good for monetary policy”. Wouldn’t individuals choose to own Bitcoin because it appreciates?

748 2018-12-12 22:21:26 Cannot fully agree to the negative noise being created around eToro that they must support withdrawals to wallets. They are a trading platform. I wonder how many people who use eToro actually care about withthdrawing crypto, more so than withdrawing their fiat. Trading platform.

751 2018-12-12 22:21:09 So, crypto just reminded me of another fallacy of yours, and I'm going to address it. Driving a car isn't a right. It's a privilege. Granted we're using arguing about treating gun licensure the same way as driver's license, but it still doesn't change that principle.

755 2018-12-12 22:19:48 No, it's literally a share, not even a token 'of' one held in trust.  All the same rules and restrictions apply as do to traditional securities.  Anything less would just be a derivative product.  But unlike crypto, I doubt there will be a securities 'wallet' per se

767 2018-12-12 22:17:59 I'm not suggesting malice.
Rather a quick rush to capitalize on crypto, and sloppily assuming crypto investments would follow traditional investments as far as banks and CC companies regarding funding and withdrawals.
Use of words like "purchase" and "buy" are slightly misleading

Althought mathematical correct , it is questionable if those rules apply. Look at other crypto prices and adoption phases. Expensive whitepapers and no complaining

807 2018-12-12 22:11:45 One day.. I am going to pay off my mortgage with all the money I made thanks to #crypto. And all the people will be talking about me going on holiday 5 times a year and how I can afford it.. just saying.
808 2018-12-12 22:11:41 Maybe I am missing something. You said under a minute? LTC does this in seconds; so does TRX. I am not bashing XRP. TBH I havent really done any deep research on them. You seem to know what you're talking about, but a whole minute seems sluggish compared to some other platforms.
809 2018-12-12 22:11:34 Actual sources that it didn't go well?
810 2018-12-12 22:11:32 It is absolutely true with fiat. That means it will also fail. People will grow tired of exchanging value like that. I am over simplifying but some of fiat's fatal flaws are also present in crypto so it will not be spared.
811 2018-12-12 22:11:20 According to eToro platform statistics, 90% of women registered to the platform have invested in crypto. The women’s crypto coins were XRP (51%), BTC (15%), ETH (10%), LTC (6%) and XLM (3%).
812 2018-12-12 22:11:12 True. No longer an agent after that
813 2018-12-12 22:11:05 If you agree to this than you have no idea how crypto or a dictatorship works.
814 2018-12-12 22:11:00 Exactly. It’s literally easier to just buy the damn $200 keyboard instead of giving razer free crypto and spending thousands more on electricity
815 2018-12-12 22:10:59 They're not a threat. We have a unique offering which is multiple markets in one account and the social features.

822 2018-12-12 22:09:37 Once installed, SoftMiner runs silently in the background to solve complex computing challenges using idle GPU processing.

But what is the practical use for these 'challenges'? 

Are they mining other crypto with user cycles in exchange for their own coins?

842 2018-12-12 22:06:37 I was at the Hyperledger Global Forum today and going again tomorrow. My impression from talks so far is, that these companies aren't focused on "crypto-powered networks" as you call then, but rather - as you said - on reorganization of structures to increase efficiency.

854 2018-12-12 22:05:23 It needs to be. I can download any 1 of 10+ apps through the App Store, complete the KYC and have full custody of the asset from the offset within the next half an hour. And that really is the reality of how much of a threat these rivals are to etoros business model
855 2018-12-12 22:05:17 I am deeply interested in blockchain/crypto and mycelium/fungi. Nice post!
856 2018-12-12 22:05:15 Followed. 
857 2018-12-12 22:05:10 Build it, and when ready, market and sell. It is deceptive to market the sale of crypto to consumers knowing most assume they could access the asset, the very nature of crypto assets, when in reality it's full of conditions. The consumer never really owns the asset.
858 2018-12-12 22:05:01 I think he's going to make him watch some of his fights.
859 2018-12-12 22:04:57 My mom always said the crypto market was like a box of chocolates, you never know which one will end up being a scam.

861 2018-12-12 22:04:53 The Sovereign Individual is actually a pretty awful book and the rate at which I see it cited and recommended in the crypto world baffles me. Sure it has a few prescient predictions, but it also has a bunch of crazy incorrect ones, factual errors, and racial pseudoscience.

866 2018-12-12 22:04:29 I have zero intention in joining a paid group, Im trading for 20 years and don't need a 20-something to hold my hand. What I do is separating the bad actors from the good actors in the crypto space to help people out like you, who do need some help.

869 2018-12-12 22:04:05 Not yet. The report saying that they know for sure 2 cases when criminals loan or invest with Moshe Hogeg in crypto currencies. I guess there is a police investigation on this right now...

875 2018-12-12 22:03:15 I can tell based on the fact that you lied and got caught.  Why don’t you take a train ride (maybe you can still catch it lol) to the nearest taco stand and apply for a job. You shouldn’t be trusted with crypto.

What‘s the special thing about Ripple‘s xRapid? Why could it be a compelling way to send money? How exactly could it change the way value moves? And what would be the macroeconomic and social implications?

If EToro doesn’t readjust it’s business model quick it will lose all old and new business
892 2018-12-12 22:00:34 The issue that came to mind is payment. The code released under GPL and any derivatives of it needs to be free. My understanding of web 3.0 is that most of what we will be using will be paid for directly (for using services and development of those services) through crypto.

922 2018-12-12 21:55:20 I don't own bitcoin. I dont really care how much its worth, what I like from crypto assets is volatility. Working on automated trading models using Deep Learning, so what I have is a few hundred bucks for trying out models with real money after paper trading.
923 2018-12-12 21:55:10 To be fair, the same can be said of many crypto exchanges.
924 2018-12-12 21:55:10 Be easy on them Jonathan in 2025.  When you tell them we will be in a multi year bear market, they will look at you funny. They will say "Don't worry, Bitcoin will be $200K by year end"  It won't take a few years to come back.  "Crypto recovers quickly....you worry too much bro!"

931 2018-12-12 21:54:44 LUCRE is poised to set a new standard for cryptocurrency participation. It aims to alter the tendency to HODL the crypto assets which doesn’t always give high returns as we have seen since the peak in December 2017. #ICO #Lucre #LCR #Tokensale
932 2018-12-12 21:54:34 @Cryptonary, I love and believe in XRP, no question. But XRP does not solve day to day payments for everyday consumer.

XRPは来春までにNASDAQで先物上場の噂もあるから、かなり意識してはいると思うのだけども。

1006 2018-12-12 21:45:48 @mappopk_crypto Someone once told me that 'time' is a predator that stalks us all our lives. But I rather believe that time is a companion who goes with us on the journey and reminds us to cherish every moment because it will never come again.

1023 2018-12-12 21:43:00 There are functional stop-loss features on exchanges. I don’t think stop-loss == stop putting money in. I think it means to protect your trade of the market doesn’t do what you think it would do.

1042 2018-12-12 21:40:11 Take a look at what happened today in the #Crypto markets

* Crypto Exchange @krakenfx to plan private offering after $4 b valuation

* New Zealand Financial Authority blacklists three crypto platforms 

* Crypto Platform Cubits begins insolvency procedure after #hack
1043 2018-12-12 21:40:08 And is not the same with Fiat money?. People change value all the time with money without intrinsic value and also susceptible to manipulation. For me it's fair to say that could happen with the crypto ecosystem, specially in the internet age.

1046 2018-12-12 21:38:58 When was the volume high enough?  Once.  And you don’t know where to get that info?  I’ve been in crypto for a little longer than you have and I know how easy the info is to find.  Blockchain...  transparency...  do you get what it is?
1047 2018-12-12 21:38:18 I'm very satisfied with the quality of this product. I confide in this ICO-project and I will suggest it to every single person who is passionate about crypto. Trust me, this product in actually that good! #ZenSports @TheZenSports

1087 2018-12-12 21:32:06 People actually buy more Crypto if Governments tried to fully ban it.

If drugs were fully legalized crime rates plummet, prisons empty, cartels out of business

1094 2018-12-12 21:31:16 Why is Sparkle token needed? It adds more options to the user to pay, in our app you'll also be able to pay with fiat so it is all up to the user to use crypto or fiat. Using Sparkle does have it's advantages like reduced fees and discounts. Hope this answers your question!

1128 2018-12-12 21:27:48 Wow. "With “know your customer” regulations, crypto monetary transfers won’t be like what we have now... Things will be _worse_ than what we have now if a system of “is-a-person” credentialing and “know your customer” governance is ever established."
1129 2018-12-12 21:27:47 IMO: Bitcoin is the most overvalued crypto-asset. Note: This does not mean btc goes lower in dollar terms, but other networks will eventually capture bitcoin's market share.
1130 2018-12-12 21:27:43 IMO I believe the release of new codebase will just calm a lot of anxious bag holders, which will reinvigorate #xvg's community, which will then help with introducing #verge to many noobs and no coiners.

1134 2018-12-12 21:27:21 Well that's just untrue. BTC can't do an awful lot of things by virtue of being the first mover in  crypto space & therefore having very inflexible protocol (see many hardforks).  Eventually can implement elements of alts (privacy, smart contracts, etc) but never as thoroughly

1145 2018-12-12 21:25:40 Thanks for the answer but what I'm trying to find out is when the 2596 will happen(around February i think), then most importantly when the uptrend will start. The uptrend could start a long time after the 2496, that's why i just wanted our top crypto guy to have a guess. Thanks
1146 2018-12-12 21:25:28 You had me at cock.... Wait what
1147 2018-12-12 21:25:09 You don't fool me

I know you


1148 2018-12-12 21:25:04 It was necessary to save and revive the original Bitcoin. It had to be done and it’s not over yet. The crypto market as it is, is a joke that will never be adapted like it sits. We only need one chain. #bsv. Now people can give up the casino and see what bitcoin can really do!!!
1149 2018-12-12 21:25:02 why isn't @realDonaldTrump on this and getting him back home. I hope he is not capitulating to the Deep State..

1152 2018-12-12 21:24:56 It says in JSP440 that during Christmas leave you can leave crypto locked in your mate’s Astra. Only caveat is you have to put it in the boot & reverse it up against garage door of parent’s house. Additionally you can’t tell YofS about it as she/he’ll get proper raging.

1) x is forming (something) will test either $a or target $b 
2) Nothing is certain so we will wait for entry. 

If this is what passes for analysis I can only imagine what most paid groups are like.

1178 2018-12-12 21:22:43 I guess it depends on whether or not you'd get paid interest on the crypto you had in storage, like some sort of ISA for example? What do you think @C3_Nik
1179 2018-12-12 21:22:37 II guess crypto is like Napster  - revolutionary and out of control and regulations, but in some ways doomed. Blockchain will evolve in the same way music industry did. The big players will prevail once more.

1200 2018-12-12 21:19:38 If there is a bank holiday, for instance like in Cyprus Geece, then the banks would seize your digital assets. It defeats the purpose of why crypto even came into existence. People lost faith in the Central Banks that put us on a path of unsustainable debt and ultimate collapse.

1204 2018-12-12 21:19:18 Stupid comment. XRP has held up better than Bitcoin, better than Ethereum, in fact, better than any other crypto asset in the space.  This time last year, BTC was $16k, XRP was .25.  Today, XRP is higher while BTC 80% lower!

Right now all Enjin items trading seems to be done in Telegram groups & shady alleyways!

1207 2018-12-12 21:18:42 Thank you for the candid feedback! No time down is a good time in crypto, and we hope to eliminate this as much as possible going forward now that we have Changelly, as well as multiple other exchange partners that we work with behind the scenes. -PB
1208 2018-12-12 21:18:29 After dotcom bubble we had maybe 10 companies that survived with a sound economic business model. Crypto will be no different. We can already see how billion/million dollar companies are already out of funds/ without any final product/without any business model
1209 2018-12-12 21:18:27 Would be nice, but don´t think so ...
1210 2018-12-12 21:18:11 A question for @Cryto_Daily: Do you ever thought about a movie with Mr. Bean? Could you ask him to produce a short Jonny English vs. Fiat Daily episode together?  This would boost his career! 
1211 2018-12-12 21:18:11 Not least because every molecule I’ve ever posted is an correctly constructed molecular representation. Anyone with any molecular understanding would see the answers in the structures. Crypto applies defined engineering rules to biology systems. It doesn’t work.

1221 2018-12-12 21:17:01 Musk had people flying over Tesla parking lots taking pictures of what rolled off the production line trying to figure out if he was lying about his production numbers.  Wall Street is madness compared to crypto.

1237 2018-12-12 21:15:25 The recent price decline in #crypto has proved that people overestimate the potential for technology short term and underestimate it long term.

1259 2018-12-12 21:13:27 Agree, and it would be a significant negative impact for amazon if they create a centralized crypto scam. I want to be my own bank, not amazon. Bitcoin meetup tonight at BTBS!!!
1260 2018-12-12 21:13:23 Arguably, because corruption in the crypto world is harder to sweep under the rug, it's been shown to have actual consequences (i.e. public shaming, skepticism, and avoidance by the community and the eventual actual downfall of the actors/participants).
1261 2018-12-12 21:13:21 Nothing big to talk about in crypto these days. Bull market done. Bear market ongoing. Developments behind the scenes say stick around and watch the world change in the coming years.

1269 2018-12-12 21:12:40 until btc figures her shit out, alts are a no trade zone for me. 

i am focused solely on her atm.

i just dont want to have to worry about watching her and other charts. at any minute she could take off either way. and so many alts are tightly coupled.

1279 2018-12-12 21:10:43 Bro! There was no such thing as a manipulated pump. The whole market went up and the whole market goes down now. Nothing else
1280 2018-12-12 21:10:38 As if the SEC & Wall Street were exempt or more immune to this.

Haters gonna hate, but corruption & insider trading is much more transparent and (comparatively) minimal in the crypto world.

1285 2018-12-12 21:10:13 What does this even mean? Is this like a crypto currency or something?
And why?
1286 2018-12-12 21:10:11 Question is: do regular people really care about that? That's the biggest concern I have regarding crypto adoption
1287 2018-12-12 21:10:10 #PlayrGG via @PlayrGG
1288 2018-12-12 21:09:54 All Australian users had their crypto converted to CFDs a few months ago. I couldn’t get into my account until I accepted the new terms and conditions
1289 2018-12-12 21:09:53 But what about Ripple? And what about my beer money. I’m so confused Fomoby. Wtf am I supposed to do with my toilet paper after I sit down to pee!?
1290 2018-12-12 21:09:47 There are many good people in the crypto community Simon.  There will always be a few bad apples but the majority of the people in crypto are good human beings trying to further the adoption of crypto to the world.
1291 2018-12-12 21:09:43 Worth even left after they harvest the crypto you're mining for them and pay you back in store credit Monopoly money
1292 2018-12-12 21:09:32 An excellent idea is to send dividends from crypto-trade to repair infrastructure in Ukraine. To my great regret, over the past 27 years, the infrastructure in Ukraine has fallen into complete decay.
1293 2018-12-12 21:09:31 What? We are already in altseason ...
1294 2018-12-12 21:09:29 This is pure Bullshit! GFY $XRP fans!
1295 2018-12-12 21:09:21 Nice artwork, if only other crypto were just as artistic
1296 2018-12-12 21:09:16 You’re telling me that Coinbase has made a video promoting a crypto that they don’t offer and they’ve snubbed for the past year and a half?
1297 2018-12-12 21:08:55 Such a solid movie
1298 2018-12-12 21:08:48 its the gamblers way

good luck
1299 2018-12-12 21:08:48 They are telling you to download a crypto miner so you and your PC mine crypto for them, slowly destroying your rig while they profit and give you near worthless "silver".

1303 2018-12-12 21:08:27 Buy some right now, “the freshly printed from CEO”. You might get it for cheaper. Would love to see it. Or you can go on an exchange, like you would with many other crypto in the market.
1304 2018-12-12 21:08:23 Smooth!
1305 2018-12-12 21:08:18 Im definitly agree with you, but everyone has his own oppinion and idea’s and i must respect that.

1321 2018-12-12 21:05:37 This is the number one problem in Crypto projects. Would love to see a new project that says “we are building this new revolutionary app and it will be powered by BTC via LN”.
1322 2018-12-12 21:05:26 Where was this challenge a year ago @vitaminwater? I could really have used a year of not checking my #crypto portfolio every 2 seconds. Next year I'll be trying to log into every computer around to see where it's at. #nophoneforayear
1323 2018-12-12 21:05:22 Hey @onchainfx could you please check your emails and answer my question regarding API pricing ? Thanks!
1324 2018-12-12 21:05:03 So everyone thinks Facebook, Amazon, Alibaba, Google, Apple and other big players don‘t plan anything big? I can‘t wait for Amazon declaring war on BTC announcing their own crypto. Just imagine,,,
1325 2018-12-12 21:05:01 The extra fun part is whatever crypto you "earn" from this is going to be worth far less money than the spike in your electric bill is going to cost you
1326 2018-12-12 21:04:48 So you've no answer to a functioning "society" where government doesn't exist at all.  Of course not.
1327 2018-12-12 21:04:45 If I'm not mistaken, there is no mining, right?
1328 2018-12-12 21:04:41 Bad time to get into crypto?
1329 2018-12-12 21:04:06 altseason = btc go back to around 5k  :p

1333 2018-12-12 21:03:37 You have no problem with Roger redirected pooled hash that users had dedicated to BTC to his own needs?  And no problem with businesses colluding instead of fighting with dedicated hash?  BCH only survived by borrowing the hash that will one day destroy them; nice friends.

1364 2018-12-12 20:58:52 the only way this makes any sense is if they are using this to mine a different crypto coin, that they then own in exchange for these 'points'. Which would be actually worse
1365 2018-12-12 20:58:48 Fark. That’s about 1 Eth next month.
1366 2018-12-12 20:58:40 to be honest, I'm surprised the XTREME GAMERZ market has taken this long to get in on crypto scams.
I guess the ROI on slapping LEDs on black plastic isn't what it used to be.

1370 2018-12-12 20:58:05 I will reach you soon colleague ! 
1371 2018-12-12 20:58:03 100% going to be a super important year.
1372 2018-12-12 20:57:55 good man. that made me smile.
my son almost died from an auto-immune disease a couple of years back and his brain and spine were affected. i gave him his rubiks cube after he recovered and although he couldnt figure it out in 2 min, he was able to complete.
i know your joy there.
1373 2018-12-12 20:57:55 Yes ma’am I am sure you are right. That is going to pave the way for crypto currencies
1374 2018-12-12 20:57:48 YOU DON'T SAY 
1375 2018-12-12 20:57:45 Interesting, interesting, maybe @PoppyPOS TRONcard could be worked into that.
1376 2018-12-12 20:57:33 Apparently I’m the only one on crypto twitter *actually* following the “Only invest what you can afford to lose” advice
1377 2018-12-12 20:57:22 Love the process as much as you love the prize, right. So Dan, when are you going to pun them guns down for a sec and come back to crypto

1379 2018-12-12 20:57:19 Ah too bad, pairing crypto support in Bitcoin is not too likely as far as I have heard. If it was only need by the LN nodes that would be cool though.

1392 2018-12-12 20:55:10 LOL! that's just ripping off your costumers, if you wanted to have some 'crypto' Razer token you better looked into #TRON, no need for mining and all fundamentals of a decentralized blockchain. Btw you already lost me after buying a broken Razer Chroma.. Only good for mousepads!
1393 2018-12-12 20:55:10 I'm investing in crypto

1408 2018-12-12 20:53:12 Steve, this miner voting mechanism is already dead to BCH so there's really no need to keep beating that horse.  They preferred checkpointing, coopting pooled hash and exchange collusion to this mechanism.
1409 2018-12-12 20:53:03 Can i accept #bitcoin or #crypto payment?
1410 2018-12-12 20:53:03 Monero or TokenPay
1411 2018-12-12 20:52:57 TL上にはたくさん稼ぐ人が多いが、たくさん稼ぐコツは「目標額を高く設定すること」だと考える。

稼ぐ額の目標が高いほど、たくさん稼ぐ方法を見つけやすくなるからだ。反面、稼ぐ額の目標が低ければ、稼ぐための方法が目の前にあっても見逃してしまうことが多い。常に高いところを目指すことが重要。
1412 2018-12-12 20:52:56 Still?after all the foundation Ripple has laid???

1415 2018-12-12 20:52:15 I’m not running into traffic and leaving my car running either and I’m pretty sure the guy that recorded was trying to wake him up to keep traffic moving
1416 2018-12-12 20:52:08 I'm not eager for that.  I am anxious to see Australia's legislature correct this grievous error, but that will only happen if there are prompt consequences.  Taken to its conclusion, this is literally a fight for the right to have and share "bad thoughts".  That's important.
1417 2018-12-12 20:51:58 Transaction vale shouldn't be taken into consideration, imo
1418 2018-12-12 20:51:51 good question. makes me wonder if it's just mining some form of crypto in the background for razer and then giving you "silver" for it
1419 2018-12-12 20:51:48 thanks! how much are tickets and where can i buy them?
1420 2018-12-12 20:51:42  for real. Results minded, not labor minded.

1422 2018-12-12 20:51:33 In the UK each person is protected to £85k per financial institution, in a cash account, if it bellied up.  Not sure about custody of my crypto.  Im sure there will be different regulations/protection on crypto and will i get interest? Therefore NO.
1423 2018-12-12 20:51:32 I will sell half mine at 10.00 unless it blows past it, and the rest will ride till 100
1424 2018-12-12 20:51:06 $btc will eventually start climbing again. New all time highs will be touched, 80-95% dumps will probably continue thereafter, but with 1 sig fig added every run

1429 2018-12-12 20:50:33 oh yeah i know - I mean this whole idea of Razer having it's own crypto for it's loyalty points is also bullshit, outside of the horribleness of asking people to install this thing
1430 2018-12-12 20:50:30 English is not my native tongue, i'm from the Netherlands. I think the point is clear. This guy has 90k followers and has to have some kind of responsebility towords them. Please show me the patern on a chart wich makes you cconclude there will be any bullish action next week?
1431 2018-12-12 20:50:27 Also a Guy sleeping at a light will most likely not post a threat. He’s asleep. Stop watching so many movies

1438 2018-12-12 20:49:17 Strong ecosystem. Bitcoin and Ethereum will probably retain their first mover advantage for the foreseeable future, no need to stick out. Too bad there's so much infighting in crypto communities, should focus on improving tech. No wonder people think we're lunatics.
1439 2018-12-12 20:49:17 You have to of actually had and lost money to end up on the street or bankrupt like these other crypto projects.

We're not bleeding any investors/piggy bank, no cash fire here. Just bootstrapping hustle and hard work. 

The #beeteam will be fine.

You on the other hand... jk
1440 2018-12-12 20:49:15 People have been asking when the final IIS Crypto 3.0 is going to be released. Originally it was Nov so we could test with Server 2019. However, MS has still not released an image in Azure. In the meantime, we are posting a second beta with even more features in the next week.
1441 2018-12-12 20:49:11 I think there's a good chance for my new essay to release tomorrow. Stay tuned Marines and be on the lookout
1442 2018-12-12 20:49:10 Nice crypto

1444 2018-12-12 20:49:06 I exaggerated, I’m obviously not going to purposely try and brake the window. I ain’t trying to get my hands cut. But I will bang on it with reasonable force... and again you have not lived my life. You don’t know what I am capable off..

1447 2018-12-12 20:48:45 Or was it a manipulated pumpage that got you and many others trapped? Doesn't seem like there's much demand for X-nodes and $vtho is worthless
1448 2018-12-12 20:48:31 Why is 5 dimes asking this question?
1449 2018-12-12 20:48:27 Bitcoin has nothing to do with your ancap fantasies; it is a neutral, global ledger and your political approach will *prevent* adoption on the BCH chain.  Good luck with that.
1450 2018-12-12 20:48:22 XRP is the stuff wolf of wall street sold. Ironically to the same kinds of people.

1454 2018-12-12 20:48:02 This shouldn’t be taken seriously lol, just marketing and branding strategy.
1455 2018-12-12 20:47:58 Info was leaked on the S10 they can confirm that. They haven’t admitted to these claims yet true. I don’t think it’s false though
1456 2018-12-12 20:47:57 Even though crypto has not bottomed its seems my follower count has bottomed. If we use this number 1,160 followers than next month $BTC will be 1,160.00 USD
1457 2018-12-12 20:47:49 @mappopk_crypto
1458 2018-12-12 20:47:49 P2P payments will beat out all other forms of payment, period. Be it btc/crypto or another method. Venmo and Paypal are big in US and EU but damn sure can't travel the world with them. USD will tokenize just to compete, but too little to late most likely.
1459 2018-12-12 20:47:45 This man is striving to make a difference in all our crypto lives!! Bless him and let’s spread the word !!

1462 2018-12-12 20:47:36 I've just checked your profile. Most of your posts are about Syscoin and you are telling me that I shilled GRS 5 times in a year?

You seem like the perfect guy Syscoin will scam with their intentional wrong information.

I don't know if should I laugh or feel sorry for you.
1463 2018-12-12 20:47:29 Ok
1464 2018-12-12 20:47:06 
1465 2018-12-12 20:47:03 They need something to do now crypto has gone bust.
1466 2018-12-12 20:46:59 @MatiGreenspan in the EToro wallet why can’t I move my #LTC trades balance into my wallet balance?
1467 2018-12-12 20:46:56 whattt!!!?!?! i shill it all the time under posts... and i agree ripple is def not a scam... they have a very good foundation and great tech... I have learned that in this space when people are talking shit about projects that means its time to look deeper into them 
1468 2018-12-12 20:46:47 yes precisely. i giggle when i see VCs say how the greatest hurdle is UX. I mean....if UX is an issue, perhaps “crypto” is too shitty? But, then, perhaps we could improve that technologically?
1469 2018-12-12 20:46:44 UK regulators are thinking of banning retail crypto derivatives btw @cftc @TheFCA while ceo of allianz global investors said #crypto is ‘fraud’
1470 2018-12-12 20:46:40 Reminds me of a a crypto conference I was at and met this guy who was shilling this stem cell research project on the blockchain (I forget the name). I asked him why do you need a coin/ICO. Hes like, "because thats how everyone is raising money". I shook my head and walked away
1471 2018-12-12 20:46:35 That dude is high out of his mind.. ur gonna pit urself in that situation? U have no idea what he is on or what he has in the car and ur gonna bust a window out. I think not.
1472 2018-12-12 20:46:33 Sight. The word you want to use in that context is “sight”, as in vision.
1473 2018-12-12 20:46:16 To be honest, I still can not believe that $ADK will succeed as expected by Mr. #RicardoBadoer. Because it is too grand plan. If it was truly approved by the #ETF, it would be a historic moment for the crypto.

1475 2018-12-12 20:45:59 Exactly. That's why I hold $XRP, the PTB have most likely set this entire #crypto revolution into motion. But like the internet, I think it'll get a bit out of their control. The next level up for humanity. With that said, banks are not going anywhere soon. $XRP = SWIFT 2.0

1482 2018-12-12 20:44:56 to be fair absolutely called out for the scam marketing wallet on Toro is - in terms of crypto set up, wire transfer - really.... noobs may not understand what you do, but to most with a ledger , you are thieves. Not supporting certain forks etc is also funny, take and sell on...
1483 2018-12-12 20:44:56 I hope you guys go on a podcast together! You are both smart and reasonable and have strong opinions, which is fair. I guess no one knows the future of crypto, but it has to be explored in all directions.

1501 2018-12-12 20:43:20 according to the FAQ it's not a cryptocurrency... so why the hell do they requiring mining for their own 'loyalty points'? This might be the worst use of crypto out of all the terrible uses of crypto
1502 2018-12-12 20:43:04 Worst part is that not only can that be used to prosecute them, but also to coerce them..case in point, Kushner using Russian crypto to establish backchannel comms w/ Kremlin..
1503 2018-12-12 20:43:03 #UpTherium Uptherium accesses crypto applications that meet your everyday crypto needs to help you provide early access to new projects. Curiously, we work and look at the result! @UpTherium

1509 2018-12-12 20:42:44 Let him blackmail his way into your group and then trust that he has the integrity to give a fair review! Seems like a reasonable guy! Crypto is home to the free-look shakedown and now it's moving from algos/bots to actual f'ing groups.
1510 2018-12-12 20:42:35 I really didn’t get this from the piece, Seth. IMO it was more a testimony of the lasting bonds that, against all odds, some remnants of Jewish identity still exerts on descendants of converso’s. It’s a fascinating story, the “Crypto Jews” of New Mexico & No. Mexico.
1511 2018-12-12 20:42:35 Best crypto project no doubt! I'm all in on it.
1512 2018-12-12 20:42:30 Sounds like something someone long crypto at much higher prices would say . . .

1526 2018-12-12 20:41:09 ETF's are pointless too. 

What's the point in a crypto ETF (usually pegged to an index or trading close to the asset value of a crypto) when it will simply mirror what's happening in this non-stable market. 

A basket of crypto's in the ETF would still lead to losses like 2018.

1529 2018-12-12 20:40:48 Exactly. Its a shame that the crypto space resorts to XYZ vs. ABC (what i did above..) Imagine if we all worked together and offered solutions instead of insults...

Also it’s not a scam. Oh and Ripple is nothing to do with it. Only created it and holds 80% of 100bn tokens. So it’s decentralised.
Obviously. 

And it has a great tip bot - yay!!
1537 2018-12-12 20:39:39 you're right. im ready this time

1540 2018-12-12 20:39:22 Yup because i know this crypto space is doing big things behind big closed doors. And #TRX and #XRP are gonna be doing it big in two years for sure.
1541 2018-12-12 20:39:12 All I read is, "I'm not trustworthy," in that. Ep1 has the worst plot, dialog, and acting, and that's not getting into the crypto-racism.

Meesa says Last Jedi is far more watchable. It's not great, but it's way more watchable. And ESB is #1.

1569 2018-12-12 20:35:52 Proof of keys should start now, so that it may be orderly. Then stay in private keys until payment must be made, or exchange for crypto/token/fiat. A single day back and forth will be disruptive to those who depend on Bitcoin for real use cases.
1570 2018-12-12 20:35:43 I do & there is alot of mobile detailing that is done, especially on my street.
This is where we have a difference of opinion, I think that simple platforms like this will help in mass adoption especially folks that are interested in crypto but dont know how to get started.

1573 2018-12-12 20:35:24 @SamsungMobile didn't confirm that.
1574 2018-12-12 20:34:13 I love this. I have also been thinking about the importance of reaching out to people outside of the space. Speaking at conferences that aren't actually ABOUT crypto or blockchains. Going on podcasts with a more diverse listener-base, etc.
1575 2018-12-12 20:34:05 I dont see #tron #trx @justinsuntron why?
1576 2018-12-12 20:33:56 Was this hyperbitcoinization?
1577 2018-12-12 20:33:53 $XRP has been one of my favorites they have a great tip bot that works on mobile and on twitter. Extremely fast transactions. A good community and strong developers. Plus I can store it on my @coolwallet.  Good price action too plenty of opportunity with the volume.

1582 2018-12-12 20:32:59 Not sure where you are getting that from but this is completely untrue. Good chance we have 12 months plus of low prices until we get closer to halving or a@big event causes a spike
1583 2018-12-12 20:32:51 MYbe a little off topic in the Quran it talks about how the world will eventually have Cashless money!!! (Crypto)... something to think about

1593 2018-12-12 20:30:54 Cheers goat!
1594 2018-12-12 20:30:50 Just comes to your vision of what you see. You see a video that talks about crypto. I see the big picture the real meaning of the video.
1595 2018-12-12 20:30:45 The point of it is, when tomorrow  regulations on crypto in your country change,your account get closed on a 14 day notice.
Now you bought 50K in a bear year wich means you are 30K down on your investment.
Result: you Will leave Etoro owning no xrp and 30K of loses.
Thatstherisk
1596 2018-12-12 20:30:44 Still a very real systemic threat to crypto. Nothing about Tether has changed for the better. Just ask the ongoing DoJ investigation into price manipulation via USDT. It is also the main reason we won't get an ETF any time soon. Still having insane withdrawal issues as well.
1597 2018-12-12 20:30:39 Lmao. You don’t have to be a big fish use Coinbase pro. You’re already registered if you use regular Coinbase, same login. Deposit fiat so no charges, go to pro and deposit it from your coinbase wallet, buy on pro for no fees, then send for free from pro.
1598 2018-12-12 20:30:28 Good man ! Exactly What the world and crypto needs
1599 2018-12-12 20:30:19 I'm sorry but i think It's not who really want's to be in crypto or not,it's who belives in it so much that will stay in this bear market and learn something in the time being.

1611 2018-12-12 20:28:40 @BankOfScotNews, is there any plans for a crypto exchange for customers to buy digital assets with custodial services? As a customer i would be interested Any feed back would be excellent. Thanks
1612 2018-12-12 20:28:33 It a working strategy. Tech companies often do this and get more exposure then the original business. Lot of VCs adopt this as primary strategy. The fundamental problem is execution  in crypto.

1616 2018-12-12 20:27:57 Good, another huge company feeling threatened... you would not suggest to ban crypto otherwise. Hey @Allianz insure yourself and buy #bitcoin 
1617 2018-12-12 20:27:46 Imo I don't think is as big as you think. People exagerate things way waaay to much, especially when there a unknown factor and crypto is full of them.
1618 2018-12-12 20:26:56 Wright then talks about #BSV #BCHSV & says that it is being scaled and it will able to handle over 4 million transactions a second in the near future. At a cost of $0.0025 a transaction on average, miners will earn over $10,000 per block.

1684 2018-12-12 20:17:30 they have a fairly succesful business at 28nm and above with lot of broadcom, qualcomm and legacy products plus new auto designs. but at 7nm i dont know if anybody else was even trying to qualify them. maybe some crypto guys but they all probably pulled out once BTC collapsed
1685 2018-12-12 20:17:27 I appreciate your support, i dont get much of it.. lets just say my TA and my bearish sentiment isnt how ive become popular...  even though weve been so bearish, i feel like crypto has a strong future!
1686 2018-12-12 20:17:26 At this crypto conference and let me tell you. Very exciting times coming

1692 2018-12-12 20:16:40 The only bubble in the crypto space is fake ico's, fake VIP groups and the shitcoins, the projects which are building everyday no matter the trend of the market will thrive...
1693 2018-12-12 20:16:22 Not clear that the SoV use case commands a 60B marketcap either, but here we are, in speculation land. BTC is still a theoretical SoV and a new asset. The majority of the value of the crypto is still speculative and it's hard to determine fair pricing. This is not specific to XRP
1694 2018-12-12 20:16:19 No, because if it’s anything like their custody of my fiat, they’ll find a way to make it co$tly for me to give them the privilege of holding my crypto assets.
1695 2018-12-12 20:15:54 They aren’t admitting to it. I wouldn’t either. People leak things all the time. People are coming out with cold wallets that look like phones. Why wouldn’t a phone company just add a crypto feature and call it a day? We shall see. Buy the rumor, sell the news.

1698 2018-12-12 20:15:40 Evidence PewDiePie is a Nazi:
-He paid fiverr guys to say something ridiculous he could react to
- He said the N word once
-He shouted out an already popular anime YouTuber who is a crypto

It's more evidence of him being an idiot which is not uncommon for YouTube.

1782 2018-12-12 20:00:31 @exodus_io Hey guys, are there problems sending EOS? I've been trying to send and I could not, I've refreshed like 4 times and still nothing ... but according to the status on the page, everything is operational. I tried another crypto, and I had no problems.
1783 2018-12-12 20:00:30 great
1784 2018-12-12 20:00:26 $DIG Actually @ronniemoas is very good humanoid to follow. You just  have to do the opposite he recommends in crypto. So far batting average would be 99 pct.
1785 2018-12-12 20:00:26 Of course people would. They actually want to *own* what they buy/trade for. Ownership isn't confined, especially in crypto. There's zero reasons to hold anyone's assets hostage in this fashion in my mind... at least for legitimate reasons. I can think of a few not-so-legitimate.

1847 2018-12-12 19:53:40 FB will probably do something. It's inevitable. But why quit crypto over it?
1848 2018-12-12 19:53:39 I don't necessarily think we need an #ETF, #Bakkt or any institutional entry as long as more people agree #crypto has value. However, institutions will offer some validity which will pull a lot of retail investors off the sidelines.

1851 2018-12-12 19:53:19 Might be a convenient way for you to see things. A lot was worse back then, very true. In or out thd EU wouldn't have stopped us evolving. 
I am part of that service economy that uses people WW. Even paid an overseas employee in crypto.
Painting me as old fashioned is lazy.
1852 2018-12-12 19:53:05 Also, $MTL has a market cap at just below $8 million right now. With its vision of mass adoption, ask yourself why you are not accumulating MTL now both by using the app and buying MTL.
1853 2018-12-12 19:52:38 100%.

1862 2018-12-12 19:50:40 If you just think back to 2017 at the peak of a SMALL speculative bull-run. 

Were any of these crypto's actually performing as expected? 

BTC - In some cases 24 hour waits for confirmations + hard forks.

ETH - CryptoKitties BROUGHT THE NETWORK DOWN. 

Scalable? Hardly.

1896 2018-12-12 19:46:09 I haven’t had a look for a few days. I’m expecting some money on Friday so want to buy more. Yo fun face what do you think of DRGN at these prices? Incredible prices right now, totally over looked. How the fook is Dentacoin (a coin to pay your dentist) higher than DRGN 
1897 2018-12-12 19:46:07 Vos collègues continue de me raccrocher au nez ! Après une mise en attente de 15 min pour aller parler sois disant à leur manager...!!

1898 2018-12-12 19:46:05 I don’t believe so? I don’t think I ever even set one since it’s an organization...and we’d only sent a handful of tweets and retweets, and only about ETH and ETHglobal events. @jack @jess someone tell someone to stop targeting innocent crypto orgs volunteering for events -_-
1899 2018-12-12 19:46:01 100k a year are more than enough to afford you a comfortable living (depending on where you live ofc) and you have most of the day free.
1900 2018-12-12 19:45:58 Cause you place a bet on etoro for the price to go up or down. That's the same for all the assets on etoro crypto/stocks/gold etc.

1904 2018-12-12 19:45:07 Genesis Vision $GVT has a super-impressive investing platform already in production. With Forex just around the corner it looks like a 2019 winner. The only drawback is that US residents are unable to use the platform at this time.

1911 2018-12-12 19:43:37 There is always more context. If you were a part of the conversation thread you would know what it was about. I think its pretty reckless to blast someone on CT with one snapshot from a private discord channel.
1912 2018-12-12 19:43:36 I am now
1913 2018-12-12 19:43:30 I’m hearing security tokens could be big in 2019. I’m a big fan of $rvn and bullish since Patrick Byrne has left overstock to focus on crypto full time. I also heard he put millions of his own money into $rvn 
1914 2018-12-12 19:43:28 You responded your question yourself, if a vacation home exchange needs 60 years for mass adoption, then crypto might need 200 years
1915 2018-12-12 19:43:20 Is ok, he’s got some to spare

1918 2018-12-12 19:42:47 And they don‘t have to. Coz the majority of etoro user who buy crypto don‘t give a rats ass. The xrp news feed on etoro is embarressing. Those folks are really not the lightest bulb on the x-mas tree. So of course they wud have been an easy target for this infamous ad yesterday.
1919 2018-12-12 19:42:33 @crypt0snews probably. He's by far the best crypto youtuber, and he's super honest/respectful guy. Also he's someone that I think would personally be into this project.
1920 2018-12-12 19:42:15 Take heart during holiday events CT, for this time next year we shall see who is still talking that blockchain-not-crypto jazzmatazz.
1921 2018-12-12 19:42:12 I've been playing with the thought to analyze crypto projects their marketing efforts to predict price action - if they're doing marketing right, adoption will be faster (disregarding project quality, just marketing in a vacuum).
1922 2018-12-12 19:41:56 Nice Project

1925 2018-12-12 19:41:46 Normally I would say, that they are waiting for regulation to be clear, but like the lady from sec said: "it can take years". I think, that soon there will sooo much pressure on everybody to proceed, that they simply gonna go ahead with launch.Only guessing.
1926 2018-12-12 19:41:26 Not offering XRP must be a mistake @winklevoss @tylerwinklevoss XRP is superior to any other crypto currency ever created, please consider XRP !

So in the end of the show, I am glad to meet the few of ya

For the rest, I get to enjoy a circus for free

1939 2018-12-12 19:39:21 Just because a coin had a 50x before doesn't mean it will again.

Try to identify trend divergences and bullish trends with strength. This way you can make profit constantly not only in crypto but every market.
1940 2018-12-12 19:39:20 #Blockchain #Crypto What prevents you from shorting $#btc below $6400 when bearish setups form?

1951 2018-12-12 19:37:36 Depends on your trading level. I'd say more like 60/40 for more experienced day traders. There's money to be made during every reversal
1952 2018-12-12 19:37:02 When I'm researching new #crypto cos, I just substitute the word "gold." For instance, the startup I'm looking at now: "Earn free gold when you shop online!"
1953 2018-12-12 19:36:55 India won't have any impact in CRYPTO, forget if you think it has. Governments won't allow Crypto! They've banned Banks from dealing with it already. Its a DOOM here. I reside here, I know how foolish it is to think and hope something like you're doing. 
1954 2018-12-12 19:36:55 Done :)

1968 2018-12-12 19:34:13 The good news about the crypto meltdown is that at its current price level, Bitcoin only needs a paltry $5 million per day of inflows from clueless “investors” to pay for the miners’ electricity bills.
The bad news is that these miners are drowning in debt that’s coming due soon.

1988 2018-12-12 19:30:52 A crypto exchange, I would follow that religiously. But that is not what they are, even if their business is taking them there, fast. If you trust, there is no problem.

1995 2018-12-12 19:30:00 Is it just be or was the apple wallet released a few days ago? The team is cheating no one. They are honest and keep everyone up to date which is a good thing unlike crypto who just ignore their community and release nothing

2003 2018-12-12 19:29:30 There has been a lot of heat around that wallet, and rightly so. But I’m perfectly happy. When I buy stocks they keep them for me. Same with the crypto I buy from them. I understand the mantra that if your keys are not yours, the coins aren’t either. And for...

2011 2018-12-12 19:28:47 And besides that, when you buy on etoro by credit card they dont tell you that you cannot move your coins
The rule in crypto is if you buy crypto you buy the real coins and can move them
Etoro dont have this information openly to all
So people are misled

2014 2018-12-12 19:28:25 Each and every sentence of Rogoff's article is completely wrong. Nothing could be further from the truth.
But thats a good sign for a near end of the bear market, when such nobel laureates extract such sermon.
Buy Bitcoin, or your perfered Crypto, now, 
just my guess.

2024 2018-12-12 19:27:09 it doesnt repaint. i’m using the bot since 1 month and i’ve saved/made already lot of money thanks to Lotus. for example the bot caught the drop from 6500. it also works good for stocks not only crypto. i’m very satisfied so far!

2028 2018-12-12 19:26:44 (11) just think of ANYONE outside of the crypto space (like ordinary folks not us OCD crypto fanatics) – most will not touch crypto because of this exact thing I have explained. Many many more people than you think fall into this camp.
2029 2018-12-12 19:26:22 You need to leave Bitcoin alone, this whole thing has been terrible for the crypto space. BTC will always be the real Bitcoin. BSV is a joke.

2120 2018-12-12 19:13:06 Everybody enquire me for this product since I'm a professional in crypto. My point of view on this ICO-project is quite positive. #mindsync #ico
2121 2018-12-12 19:12:44 It might, but if your okay with 4-6 hours of sleep, no free time, use the weekends to sleep
2122 2018-12-12 19:12:42 mhmm Freudian slip on the gifs there 
2123 2018-12-12 19:12:39 @mappopk_crypto excellent team
2124 2018-12-12 19:12:38 For all the reasons why Crypto headz hate $XRP are the very reasons why normies love or will love XRP. Say what you want about Ripple but they built the strongest brand in crypto. Don't underestimate strong corporate brands when it comes to big money investing.

2126 2018-12-12 19:12:30 @mappopk_crypto great project
2127 2018-12-12 19:12:28 Merci du partage et d'avoir apporté de la visibilité à notre travail 
2128 2018-12-12 19:12:27 3. Scale. Once you have an approach do not change it. Keep doing the same thing with bigger size.
2129 2018-12-12 19:12:04 I’m surprised it’s still been sitting above $3k lately
2130 2018-12-12 19:12:03 To practice my intuition I like to guess if the crypto will be up or down... 80 percent of the time I have been correct.
2131 2018-12-12 19:11:53 2.Manage your risk. Take care of your risk and everything else will take care of itself
2132 2018-12-12 19:11:44 My experience is very good i have learnt a lot from bc and mr moe they both are very humble and kind
2133 2018-12-12 19:11:37 I don’t cause chaos - BTC and crypto in general is chaos!
2134 2018-12-12 19:11:35 1.Block out all the noise. Narrow your focus and MASTER an approach. Don’t dabble in 5.  We are in a competitive space and you need to a skill. 

For me, auction market theory, volume profile and price action. That is my approach

2138 2018-12-12 19:11:07 I see, well the drop in price of EMB is due to a multitude of factors. FUD after previous project failure, crypto bear market, a lot of elapsed time without progress (until now), Cryptopia issues, etc. 

Nonetheless, looking at today’s EMB price is not reflective of our future.
2139 2018-12-12 19:11:01 You guys do realize that you actually fed this craze? Right? I mean, surely you can’t be such hypocrites? Right?

2143 2018-12-12 19:10:23 Crypto is a decade old. When is it no longer a “new” asset class?
2144 2018-12-12 19:10:18 It’s 4000% away from $BTG... absolute madness.

2149 2018-12-12 19:08:58 The real use case for crypto is to send money to those who are de-platformed.  Patreon, Visa, MasterCard.  The corporations power combined supersede the US Government protections. Crypto clowns have a golden opportunity for a solid use case but still fail to use it. #btc #bitcoin
2150 2018-12-12 19:08:52 Absolutely $NIX @NIXplatform

2153 2018-12-12 19:08:28 I find it strange how people voted for 6 hours a day, when the 16 hour option provides the most income per hour of work, despite it being very difficult to realize beyond theory.

2155 2018-12-12 19:07:35 Only a twat would complain, it’s obVs about community mindset
2156 2018-12-12 19:07:27 Never thought I'd hear the co-founder of a company say that it's important to swiftly kill the jobs of real people, with bills to pay and families to feed, in order to make a political point.
2157 2018-12-12 19:07:23 @KingThies is a good man, but he made a lot of bad calls on $btc
2158 2018-12-12 19:07:09 @crypto_beardy We have beards too! Thanks for the follow.
2159 2018-12-12 19:06:52 In tech, typically product is built and released ASAP (hence an MVP). Companies get feedback and iterate as they go. Build what people want then tweak/improve as you go. 

Seems like a lot of crypto projects have that backwards.
2160 2018-12-12 19:06:19 What are 3 things I can start to learn this week while on vacation about trading. I like crypto and potstocks.
2161 2018-12-12 19:06:15 But just in etoro rules if we buy a crypto we cannot do what we want!
If i bought xrp, and if i bought the real coin asset, they are mine (not cfd) so i must have the chance to do what i want with it
And not what etoro allows me to
2162 2018-12-12 19:06:06 We're still in the #Crypto wild west days.

2170 2018-12-12 19:04:14 Yes they have power and instruments to stop btc. When people will realize that btc is just first crypto In Blockchain and there are another >1000 cryptos. How they will stop another crypto and another, etc???

2174 2018-12-12 19:03:39 Crypto right?
2175 2018-12-12 19:03:34 Does crypto provide any kind of buyer protection like Paypal does?

2208 2018-12-12 18:58:28 I would much rather got paid in dollars, saved it up, and started to buy crypto now. That's actually what I've been doing. Went into tether and waited for this dip. If I only had the option of getting paid in crypto I'd be royally screwed or at least down alot.
2209 2018-12-12 18:58:25 @CryptoTaxGirl  hi, if i traded crypto to crypto at all time high. and the value of the traded crypos are currently down more than 90%. shall i report loss in my tax return report? regards
2210 2018-12-12 18:58:09 LOL! I had to create multiple support tickets both with Kraken and Ledger to get my compatible assets transferred. You should make a new article with deeper information for all crypto based on the feedback I already gave you...

Why is it so difficult for people to understand that XRP is a digital asset and Ripple is a company?? Am I alone?

2239 2018-12-12 18:54:29 I agree, and I can see why in a vacuum without context people could take it as FUD. But a community leader should know better to do at least some research. She thought etoro still used cfd's and had no ability to move crypto to wallets.

2260 2018-12-12 18:50:25 What is your view on forex and crypto trading, 

I am heavily learning at the moment + involved in some high-end lecture courses

Knowledge increasing rapidly, looking forward to not only trade for myself but also expand once I polish my craft good enough
2261 2018-12-12 18:50:16 CAN be. Sure.
But giving the decision to buy crypto with dollars (which you use to pay all your shit) at a certain point in time is better made by yourself than by your employer.

2310 2018-12-12 18:42:52 This is such a silly analogy. We're talking about a new age financial asset. Not a PC.

All financial assets are subject to regulatory, security, compliance and business considerations.

2379 2018-12-12 18:33:06 as a crypto trader ive found its been easier to make money off of altcoin trades this year than bitcoin. a 5-10% move in alts is a lot more profitable than a 3% move in btc. when the next bull run commences i expect the opposite to be true.

2445 2018-12-12 18:24:21 I do like Etoro, except for this one major mistake they are making: Only people who bought crypto with wire transfer will be allowed to move them to a wallet.. Makes no sense, and is a very unproffessional decision! This alone makes me question Etoro’s agenda and legitimacy..

2481 2018-12-12 18:20:53 The point is that inflation in Venezuela is so heavy that even crypto is more stable and reliable than the national currency. Also, if you want to protect yourself from this happening you can convert to USD or stablecoins.

Sadly on Twitter the asshole schtick somehow gained a lot of popularity in the last year, it's everywhere.
2529 2018-12-12 18:14:52 The problem with this space is that everyone only thinks of Bitcoin or crypto as ‘replacing fiat’ and not the actual use cases of on blockchain and how it can make everyday businesses more efficient.

2541 2018-12-12 18:13:58 Bought in at 50, sold at 46-48. I was a crypto noob.
2542 2018-12-12 18:13:53 Ah ok, so now you've found this problem, this won't happen again tomorrow. Ok understood.
2543 2018-12-12 18:13:29 Thought of a better way of making your crypto currency transfer a lot more easier  without stress in a twinkle of seconds? then you've found one @Nexty platform its a fintech platform designed curbing the burden of transfer issues NEXTY promises to offer you alot more than that.

2545 2018-12-12 18:12:56 A lot of people asking what I think of the crypto market downturn.
Spoiler alert: I don't. I (still) think about users.
2546 2018-12-12 18:12:27 You are a human after all @Bleeding_Crypto. Really appreciate the honesty from you here sir! Hats off
2547 2018-12-12 18:12:14 Soon
2548 2018-12-12 18:12:12 "The most game-changing aspect of crypto-assets is that it allows for the automated programming of incentives; and if you can program incentives, you can start programming human behavior - and ultimately remove the need for a trusted third party."
2549 2018-12-12 18:12:08 With private chains, you can have a completely known universe of transaction processors. That appeals to financial institutions that are wary of the #bitcoin #blockchain.

2551 2018-12-12 18:11:56 @DasShaktikanta WHY INDIA CANNOT DOING IMPROVEMENT LIKE OTHR COUNTRIES REGARDING CRYPTO CURRENCY
2552 2018-12-12 18:11:53 Fine I guess I won’t send you the article I have coming out soon on teens wanting crypto for Christmas.
2553 2018-12-12 18:11:42 The beauty about learning how to mine new #crypto is that it forces you to learn additional technology that you didn’t think you’d have to know

That drive for wanting to mine, stopping at nothing to make it successful, is how most people succeed in life

Keep it up y’all
2554 2018-12-12 18:11:32 Maar jij vind tot nu toe alles onzin wat supporters leuk vinden. Dus ik begin er steeds minder waarde aan te hechten.

2568 2018-12-12 18:09:55 Definitely some implication there. Are you not constantly tweeting and expressing your thoughts? You've said yourself that you delete underperforming tweets, so you must care about validation (or rather fear of invalidation) to some degree?

2571 2018-12-12 18:09:35 Someone should seriously consult Jeeves about this
2572 2018-12-12 18:09:32 This, like BCH, will continue the process of weeding out most crypto’s and useless tokens. Only thing left will be actual utility tokens with network value. This free reign to fork whenever is a joke.

2574 2018-12-12 18:09:20 @DasShaktikanta WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF CRYPTO CURRENCY IN OUR ECONOMY THAT SHOULD B DISCUSSED BY U
2575 2018-12-12 18:09:17 I lost $2000 off the pcn exit crash this summer.  fuck daps
2576 2018-12-12 18:09:08 I don’t deal with etoro, but I traded crypto CFD’s with another broker. They do exactly the same as etoro. It’s how trading companies work. You don’t own the coins. Some of them allow you to switch a CFD to an actual coin. Then there is no stop loss.

2581 2018-12-12 18:08:20 Our integration with payment tokens is rather light. Essentially we need a way to sign transactions locally and then a way to call a full node. 

Signing transactions is the difficult part. We had to implement eth crypto in such a way that it worked ok the routers.
2582 2018-12-12 18:08:20 When I got in to the Cryptocurrency space as a newly I experienced my portfolio shoot up to as high as *200 of wht I originally invested after my analysis on nexty I figured NEXTY is one of those coins with such potentials #crypto

XRP was 0.005

2691 2018-12-12 17:54:51 Crazy. You should check it out. Only 2Ltc coins.about 48 bucks. Solid call signalsand TA request. It’s not my group hit up @TheCoinLawyer I too was originally skeptical. decided it was pretty cheap in the grand scheme of things when we are planning with a lot more funds than 2ltc
2692 2018-12-12 17:54:34 @NoelleInMadrid Would you agree that the single most pressing issue facing the crypto world is trading counterparty and settlement risk (plus initiator risk)? If not, how do you see it?
2693 2018-12-12 17:53:53 nah that schtick is retarded and unfunny. its like the 14 year old that recently discovered black jokes and wants to tell them to anyone who will lend an ear
2694 2018-12-12 17:53:51 Followers crypto iq test?

2700 2018-12-12 17:52:42 I was going to debate your terminology re “a real blockchain” (not quite accurate) but this photo of “Beach Style Wasy” makes up for it.  Is this figure available for pre-order?

2707 2018-12-12 17:51:34 *mind blown af*

*rebrands*

I’ve been trading stocks since the Great Depression. U plebs have nothing on me. Price will go up down or sideways probably. That’ll be 50 $XMR and 1000 $XRP. 

*exit scams gracefully*

2709 2018-12-12 17:51:32 I am a copywriter by day (but a crypto dude all the time ). 

I have been thinking a lot about how copywriting may become obsolete because of the value of teaching and explaining through images.

I should get better at that.

2712 2018-12-12 17:51:16 The total Crypto Market Cap will be X in 5 years?
2713 2018-12-12 17:51:09 @RBI @DasShaktikanta Take crypto seriously if economic growth is considered RBI's onus. Regulation isn't difficult, follow Japan's lead or one of the many countries that have regulated. There's huge potential. Gift it to posterity. #india #crypto #Bitcoin #XRP

2718 2018-12-12 17:50:36 I bet he and his company are buying the undervalued #crypto meanwhile. Where have we seen it before?  oh yes, JPMorgan and Jamie Dimon. Don't be fooled, #HODL or stay alert ready to #BTFD
2719 2018-12-12 17:50:19 Transfer the money to Coinbase Pro. Set limit orders. Or, if you want the Crypto instantly, buy using market order. The Coinbase Pro fee for market order is WAY cheaper than using their main site.

2723 2018-12-12 17:49:41 I completely agree. Savings should be kept in a cold wallet ALWAYS. But for Blockchain as a Service, it isn't a viable option. We are going to need all sorts of solutions if we want crypto to infiltrate "All The Things."

2728 2018-12-12 17:48:26 Are you surprised that get-rich-quick crypto attracted so many idiot Trump supporters? I'm not. Nor am I surprised by how quickly Trump's admin has imploded.

2736 2018-12-12 17:46:58 At 17% of its glory I know that someone bought it at
$3,500 -0x
$350- 10x
$35- 100x
$3.5- 1,000x
$0.35- 10,000x

And it may go to zero. But 

People want 
•anonymity 
•trust without verification
•ease of transaction 

Risk averse takes 12 years to 2x

Will it be $40k in 2030?

2739 2018-12-12 17:46:42 A while ago, I DM'ed such a shit talker asking what was his problem with me.
After a good talk he confessed he was broke and realized he was doing wrong.  

There is always a human being behind the keyboard and such people have a problem, trying to hide it with a big mouth.

2746 2018-12-12 17:46:12 Are you familiar with the crypto mole factor?
2747 2018-12-12 17:46:03 The main reason why most people refused to buy $BTC at $200 and though it was a good idea to buy at $20k is the mainstream media reporting on crypto.

Now again media is telling people that bitcoin is going to zero 

Mainstream media should be used as contraindicator
2748 2018-12-12 17:46:02 THE MEDIA AND THE ELITE HAVE BEEN SET A TASK TO SCARE US INTO BELIEVING CRYPTO & BTC IS CRASHING & GOING TO DIE.

THEY ARE PUTTING INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE UNTILL THEN KEEPING PRICES LOW.

IM BUYING NOW AT LOW PRICES :)

2753 2018-12-12 17:45:16 True, and we all know that the experts (including, sorry to say, Mcafee) are not really experts because there is not enough data on crypto market behavior for anyone to be an expert. Its a speculative investment but the science is solid and some day it will be a hybrid currency.
2754 2018-12-12 17:45:15 Refer to one of my posts from earlier.

2759 2018-12-12 17:44:30 here's an idea on how to cope with bear market:
make paper wallets and put your crypto in them.  
-- maybe decorate the paper, or use the "premium" stuff you know what i mean

store the paper in a safe box or place.  

treat it like treasure that one day you will unearth

2767 2018-12-12 17:43:38 No problem with currency backed by gold, but crypto currency is going to be a hard sell to Albertans. Just because it is backed by gold doesn't make it superior, if that was the case how has Canadian currency survived since 2012 when they started to sell  our reserves off?
2768 2018-12-12 17:43:35 Bitcoin is a “ digital currency “ with super high fees , slow transactions speed and high volatility price. It can go up or down 10 to 15% from point A to B.

2777 2018-12-12 17:42:40 In the next "crypto" bull market, government officials are going to use government-endorsed ICOs to aggressively scam both foreigners and their own fellow citizens. If they are very successful, it could cause the next financial crisis and destabilize society.

2784 2018-12-12 17:41:44 do not worry. Bitcoin and crypto currencies have a great future. Let there be fraudsters, speculators, bankers, so they are part of the community. People will decide who to believe. to sum it up: we will all stay on top .  #likesatoshi #btc #eth #blockchain
2785 2018-12-12 17:41:42 There are many reasons violent crime is high. One is poverty and urban decay. Another is that good people are not allowed to defend themselves.
2786 2018-12-12 17:41:40 I miss the days when crypto was about adoption. When you would see a website accepted crypto, and be like  great stuff, send some satoshis... since the boom it’s all scams and trading and no REAL use. Bring on the utility for our coins and we will prosper!

2813 2018-12-12 17:38:45 2018 was a  of a market.

However, many #crypto projects persevered through turmoil and disastrous market conditions.

Writing an article on the most impressive projects heading into 2019..

Anyone have a project that should be featured?

Please comment the project and why!

2821 2018-12-12 17:37:39 Don't be impressed with big $$$ profit some of these traders on here make.

It is completely relative. 

How big of an account do they have? 
Percentages are what matter.

How much risk did they risk on the trade?
If they risked $10,000 and only made $100, that is idiotic.

2845 2018-12-12 17:35:17 It’s going to be ugly.  All risk assets are starting to collapse due to QT.  Look at crypto currencies, Venture Capital funds, Corporate Debt, emerging markets and so on and the US just started QT and the Euro stopped QE.
2846 2018-12-12 17:35:11 Why are other analysts and traders calling for sub 3k? This seems bullish to me,  no?

2850 2018-12-12 17:34:49 #Crypto 2018 has been a command and controlled shakedown by big interest.  Interest that while dismissing this space have been building positions building infrastructure to gain as much #market share and control as possible.  What they say is irrelevant compared to what they do.
2851 2018-12-12 17:34:30 Hi.

1. You can already download through the play/app store.

2. No. Only wired funds can withdraw crypto at this time. 

3. The option for partial close of a position should be available now.

Thanks!

2854 2018-12-12 17:33:54 We need to ban together to create open source platforms that usurp the corporate monoliths and we need to use a open source crypto currency to monetize those platforms. The days of this Orwellian dystopia will be numbered if the programmers unite to create true freedom platforms.

@reliance_dex does have some interesting convos in Dicord tho.
2915 2018-12-12 17:28:44 Then, the bad guys know good people won't have a gun on them because of the laws, which makes people easy targets. Strict gun control empowers only the bad people.

2928 2018-12-12 17:27:50 See, what happens with strict gun control, is it disarms the good citizens while the bad guys are still able to get their hands on guns through the black market, or by stealing them in gun store smash and grabs with a truck and a chain pulling the metal gate off the front door.

some days its just your turn...
2950 2018-12-12 17:26:17 Ripple is still called Ripple.

Ripples, the crypto, began being called XRP (which it was also called anyway, on a more technical level), to avoid precisely this confusion.

2955 2018-12-12 17:25:37 Super, ils arrivent à cette conclusion alors que la bulle des crypto monnaies éclate enfin et que le monde tech s’est rendu compte que la block chain est une solution en quête d’un problème à régler.
2956 2018-12-12 17:25:27 Gain their trust and take their money
2957 2018-12-12 17:25:16 I will also but not too much. Government could be planning to use crypto to escape out of control fiat debt. I sometimes view the crypto market right now as a bunch of subcontractors trying to win the ultimate government money contract with their project.

2976 2018-12-12 17:22:52 Further, trading volume at this time is likely much more realistic than volume leading into 2018, when crypto investor irrationality was it its highest

2991 2018-12-12 17:21:34 Trading Tip 

Don't blindly trust technical analysis!

I love TA, but it has limitations.

Trading indicators, fundamentals, and trading systems will not make you consistently profitable. 

Only when applied to a risk management plan, will you begin to compound results.
2992 2018-12-12 17:21:22 I wanted to add more but Jack wouldn't let me. He hates me

3032 2018-12-12 17:15:31 Be careful with heat, some boots have heat activated memory materials that adjust to your foot over time and make them comfy and customized to your foot.  Adding heat can mess that process up.  Room Temp is usually best.
3033 2018-12-12 17:15:29 I mean... nobody was sooo much waiting on bitcoin 0.17 to use it. Verge is on a stable release and works fine on 4.0.2 so... why wait for use? :)

But I do prefer having Ripple own a large chunk of #XRP, which is mostly locked away in escrow.

3066 2018-12-12 17:11:30 At least from what I've heard he's done some risk management and private investments (unknown performance). Better than Barry's fee for a basket of long-only crypto anyone can buy.

3075 2018-12-12 17:10:26 People are better off mining crypto currency by themselves. At least they get 100% of the rewards and are free to use it as they see fit.

3081 2018-12-12 17:10:04 That’s why I like using BB - all three MA ‘s act as very accurate support and resistance areas as well as targets. Even pulling a fib retracement up they align very accurately.  I really love how all the different indicators work so closely with each other

3084 2018-12-12 17:09:41 Pos has been the plan for 2 years.  Lol

3099 2018-12-12 17:07:24 Amazing job! Very impressed! Did you do all of this work yourself? Is it OK for crypto news blogs to use any of your work providing that acknowledgement is given at the end of the article?

3104 2018-12-12 17:06:46 Maybe it should be about taking your coins off any exchange BY Jan 3 and ON Jan 3 we can see the community holding their own private keys at least for that day.. I already moved my coins off. Obviously if your livelihood depends on trading crypto do whatever is best for you.
3105 2018-12-12 17:06:45 In my opinion moving averages are one of the closest indicators of actual market value in an asset. It represents the middle ground between the highs and lows over a certain period. Not only that but it's one of the strongest resistance/ support besides price levels

The gateway to most Alts is through BTC. If BTC is manipulated the alts feel the same effect 

Adding more Fiat pairs to Alts will allow us to really choose who is “King” in crypto

3139 2018-12-12 17:02:01 So many other crypto projects have been, “let’s do what Bitcoin does, but as a traditional corporation.” And that just doesn’t work.

3141 2018-12-12 17:01:37 "Ponzi Scheme" 
A form of fraud in which belief in the success of a nonexistent enterprise is fostered by the payment of quick returns to the first investors from money invested by later investors.

I'd say 90% of crypto investors bought blindly with intention of quick returns.

"Market cap is bull shit" - @Excellion
#crypto
3176 2018-12-12 16:57:01 Market cap is irrelevant in an entirely new market like crypto. Bitcoin’s market cap was 1 Billion dollars 5 years ago. It was nearly 1000 times that in just 4 years. Taking the old theories from traditional/legacy markets is a limiting mindset in new, unestablished markets

3220 2018-12-12 16:51:37 important elements of a payment system of the future which nexty offers are

3231 2018-12-12 16:50:27 It's not a crypto because technically they give you no value for it. It's the same way WoW gold technically had no value until they started allowing people to buy months and pets with real money and sell for WoW Gold.
3232 2018-12-12 16:50:26 They went sleep.  Bullish

3243 2018-12-12 16:49:40 I was blocked the moment I called him on something he was fundamentally incorrect on.
3244 2018-12-12 16:49:32 alas, many decent projects are subjected to these charts due to the general crypto markets hitting bubble euphoria, stuff went up just because it hadn't gone up yet

3265 2018-12-12 16:47:09 Yeah sorry I am not perfect and vouched for him. I will leave it up to others that seems to think they are perfect to vouch for others....
3266 2018-12-12 16:47:05 nice
3267 2018-12-12 16:46:54 great
3268 2018-12-12 16:46:49 IMO If you are paying for services to help teach others trading your full information regarding who you are and such should be a pre-req before anyone decides to give you money. It is scary how gullible us humans can be when we are enticed with our greed.

3283 2018-12-12 16:45:15 I've been following him for awhile. Always seemed a little off.  Would go out of his way to talk about how great it was to be his own boss and build great businesses lol
3284 2018-12-12 16:45:06 This is the biggest missing piece of the puzzle. When people can buy, sell, transact and hold crypto’s without any technical competency then we’ll see mass adoption. In a few years ppl will transact with crypto without knowing they’re evening being used. $btc

3287 2018-12-12 16:44:55 A crypto money requires two armies:

1. A Meme army
2. A Build army

It's hard to buy these armies, a project needs to earn them 

Shill armies are a poor substitute
3288 2018-12-12 16:44:55 Hello. I do not buy or sell crypto currency. There are many exchange services on the Internet. I can not recommend you a particular one. be careful. in the frauds market a lot. 
3289 2018-12-12 16:44:44 #TIOx #bitcoin #ethereum yes crypto will definitely rise again just hold and wait

3292 2018-12-12 16:44:35 who are these people / groups ? what did they do? i dont think i am that deep in the crypto community
3293 2018-12-12 16:44:31 TBH using PayPal over Google Pay was a nice experience. Maybe Crypto credit cards like #TenX or #Monaco should focus more on NFC Apps instead of physical credit cards?

3301 2018-12-12 16:44:14 Last time I bought $1000 in $LTC from @coinbase it cost me $38 so we're not a ton off better with crypto yet until we can purchase with fiat without the insane purchase fees.

3308 2018-12-12 16:43:26 They stole kids in those times, the last reported case was in the 70s must have gone crypto mode now

3312 2018-12-12 16:43:14 fun thing I remember just now that I have also been contacted by another handle with the same profile picture asking me to work for him few months ago
3313 2018-12-12 16:43:12 USD cash.

3316 2018-12-12 16:42:48 At least you get some utility out of the miners lol
3317 2018-12-12 16:42:46 Took crypto out of my name and was instantly less depressed
3318 2018-12-12 16:42:27 Despite the current fall in the crypto market I. 2018 there will be a rise and massive adoption of bitcoin and ethereum come 2019 . #TIOx #bitcoin #ethereum
3319 2018-12-12 16:42:15 i THINK i referenced something I shouldnt have in the tweet. @C0maP0et and @CryptoxUnity can confirm whether this is correct.
3320 2018-12-12 16:42:04 I hate crypto too. That 100x I made on $vibe was rubbish!
3321 2018-12-12 16:41:58 early mass adaption will come around:
supply chain 
Blockchain as back bone for transaction

in both cases consumers will still engage with fiat (digital fiat) not crypto.
3322 2018-12-12 16:41:56 
3323 2018-12-12 16:41:54 always the same, when is cheap no one want it, when is expensive we all want it, all we need to do is do the opposite
3324 2018-12-12 16:41:48 Thinking of mining XRP. Heard it's going to be number 1 crypto soon.
3325 2018-12-12 16:41:38 In our project a very important role is played by stable energy consumption. Mining of the cryptocurrency ensures constant power consumption without voltage drops thus our installations will work around 40 years without repair.

3328 2018-12-12 16:41:25 have been contacted as well, can confirm
3329 2018-12-12 16:41:23 Based on those numbers I would say it's more stable than a crypto stable coin
3330 2018-12-12 16:41:14 I think we might be in a cycle kinda opposite the media bubble that led to 20k. Now instead of telling everyone #crypto is the bomb we are like ya I just won't tell anyone how I lost so much money. Maybe even suggest its a bad investment if they bring it up:P
3331 2018-12-12 16:41:00 Ooh. Thanks. Which book? Art of the deal?

3342 2018-12-12 16:39:55 @DAPScoin is going to be the Next DASH coin. We’ll see the FOMO Buyers pile in after it passes 1dollar and it’ll take off from there. It’s going to take the crypto world by surprise! Doubters and Haters will eat some humble pie 
3343 2018-12-12 16:39:46 Weak volume on this retest. Thinking down. What are your thoughts?
3344 2018-12-12 16:39:45 No doubt about it. Unregulated and unorganized markets have always been a playing field for cartels. Historically, it has been the case with every evolving market. Besides crypto, most recent in Indian history is of commodities.  Jignesh shah, MCX, alikes own markets that time.
3345 2018-12-12 16:39:42 I've seen these numbers in a few days in crypto
3346 2018-12-12 16:39:35 Wow, y’all are some cold hearted SOB’s .... Don't let your yearnings get ahead of your earnings.
3347 2018-12-12 16:39:32 My friend gave me some money to invest it in crypto, and I putted that in emb, He wanted to donate money when it grows but sadly it went to almost zero.
3348 2018-12-12 16:39:32 It's a good question IMHO
I think that New projects will have their own crypto currency backed by the wealth created by the project
You are free to use it or not
3349 2018-12-12 16:39:29 I concur, but then one could argue any crypto falls in the same shoes. Dogecoin can never die.

3357 2018-12-12 16:38:21 Your argument assumes that crypto will have no utility at said milestone prices? If I have debt in fiat, I will liquidate to settle in dollars. Otherwise, why are we making a planned exodus from bitcoin at some point in the future?
3358 2018-12-12 16:38:21 I started going out with a new girl last week. I just never even bothered to mention I am in crypto. last year I would have been so bragging about that like I buy you anything you want. Well at least you know a girl that sticks with you though a bear market is a keeper:)

3402 2018-12-12 16:35:01 Disagree. Markets for major crypto’s are liquid and institutions are actively engaged. By they do not trade on platforms due to lack of depth. OTC Desks are taking principal risk to fill orders and buy side is learning to custody real #crypto.  Cras Es Noster!
3403 2018-12-12 16:35:00 nah, i wouldnt do that. 

i hope you find the right guy someday.
3404 2018-12-12 16:34:59 You may have a good technique in checking your means of investing in bitcoin or crypto in general, but also check the percentage crash bitcoin has had from the previous highs and crashes in order to know where this recent crash stands. To check and tally the crash against others.
3405 2018-12-12 16:34:53 I always wanted an electronic currency that really changed  world. I think Nexty can do it perfectly. With unprecedented technology in other cryptographic coin. Nexty will be a great choice for long term investors #crypto #nexty #bitcoin

I’m being real w/ you when I say, that is not me at all!

I WILL sell some crypto for fiat if the price is right. I’ll also hold crypto

3414 2018-12-12 16:34:23 Not true, we do what we do to be the sane voice for crypto, mission from day 1.  youtube is our smallest platform, we are on approx. 100 terrestrial radio stations, top 150 podcasts on iTunes, will be on 45 terrestrial TV stations in every major city in the country come Jan.
3415 2018-12-12 16:34:23 We're not use to have more than 2 green candles in a row now on $btc and $crypto in general. 

Read on CT that it wasn't possible anymore and that every slightly move up would be engulfed the day after. 

General sentiment is 100x more bearish here than we were a 6k. Definitely.

3420 2018-12-12 16:33:46 Crypto will win for the same reason that Uber & Airbnb won.

Technology ultimately makes regulations adapt. Corruption crumble. Collusion vanish.

The people triumph over the establishment when technology empowers them.

Software engineering beats financial engineering all day.

3423 2018-12-12 16:33:35 These days are hard days for the crypto market when prices are falling deeply. But still a coin holds its value. It's the Nexty (NTY) that must have something new that can help it keep not prices from dropping like that. Learn more about it on twitter @Nextyio #crypto #nexty
3424 2018-12-12 16:33:22 With the smartstaking program, Nexty investors will always be profitable with a price stabilization system, even when the market goes down, Nexty will always stand firm in the market. Learn about this platform on Twitter or facebook, there is a lot of information. #crypto #nexty
3425 2018-12-12 16:33:21 If you’re still in #Crypto I want you by my side during the zombi apocalypse!
3426 2018-12-12 16:33:01 I think platforms which are backed up by cryptocurrency are going to boom a lot platforms like steemit Lybra and spehere social are going to make a dent on current social media ads. Hope we get to see some good news for the crypto and ads market!
3427 2018-12-12 16:32:43 I have great confidence with the Nexty platform. It will change the world in the near future with fast money transfer and zero transfer fee  #crypto #nexty #bitcoin #btc #eth
3428 2018-12-12 16:32:32 Institutionals Fudding price down to buy themselves, and when its high the same institutionals hyping it up before going short themselves

3430 2018-12-12 16:32:24 It’s quite nice actually. Unless you were going to be an arsehole and in that case, I deal with those enough.
3431 2018-12-12 16:32:20 The electronic money market is falling deeply. But Nexty's prices are still stable, even up from last week. This proves that people have a lot of belief in Nexty and I think the future is not very far, Nexty can replace bitcoin. #crypto #nexty #bitcoin

3433 2018-12-12 16:32:02 @CloudCoinRAIDA but none know It. Can be embedded on jpg, txt, email. Using raida tecnology, not blockchain
3434 2018-12-12 16:32:02 Same question! What will you do when the market goes down. For me, I will buy Nexty (NTY), which is the best platform ever. It will help you get back what you have lost #crypto #nexty #bitcoin
3435 2018-12-12 16:32:01 I believe that the high price will be driven by the financial institution (after adoption) for this very reason. 
I honestly don't see it going over a couple of dollars max before this, but potentially $1000 after. 
It just makes sense to use a bigger coin for transfers.

3439 2018-12-12 16:31:29 The cryptographic market is unpredictable due to price fluctuations and in addition, outdated technology. With Nexty, you'll experience great features along with a stable price system that keeps prices steady at a certain level.

#Samsung is developing a cryptocurrency wallet app that may launch with its, currently unreleased, Galaxy S10 device. The app will have a cold wallet for storing #crypto and a hot wallet for crypto transactions.

Another big step for adoption.

3557 2018-12-12 16:19:55 You should consider investing in Nexty(NTY)
I sincerely hope that Nexty will still get the great support from the community to strengthen us in the long run
A great platform for ecommerce, retail and payment #crypto #nexty#bitcoin #nty
3558 2018-12-12 16:19:51 Looking through some dust on #Kucoin and officially found my worst trade ever. Figured I'd share just in case anyone was having a bad day.

3575 2018-12-12 16:17:44 Nexty(NTY)is a great platform. To me, zero transfer fee is what i like best in nexty.

3678 2018-12-12 16:09:03 Why are you comfortable moving away from the whitepaper when it’s not broken?  CSW/BSV are the only ones in the space defending the original approach that has worked for 10 years straight.
3679 2018-12-12 16:08:57 CNBC desperately trying to project objective journalism, but they are only showing how bias they've become.
3680 2018-12-12 16:08:56 Hello twitter, I trade in all kind of crypto currencies
3681 2018-12-12 16:08:54 India should lead innovation so we need crypto

3688 2018-12-12 16:07:58 Ich freue mich auf ein paar agile Crypto-Zugaben.
3689 2018-12-12 16:07:56 Yes. All these different crypto animals out there. Paid group leaders. Vultures. They teach hodling during bull markets. In bear markets they blame their followers for not knowing how to trade.
3690 2018-12-12 16:07:49 I always wanted an electronic currency that really changed  world. I think Nexty can do it perfectly. With unprecedented technology in other cryptographic coin. Nexty will be a great choice for long term investors #crypto #nexty #bitcoin
3691 2018-12-12 16:07:31 It is pretty obvious Ronnie has lost it.  I can't believe anyone (good or bad) would give him the time of day at this point.  Even the bad crypto guys @badcrypto won't let him back on their show.  They have seen what a mess he is.

3701 2018-12-12 16:06:45 An awful  idea, just the amount of money that you will spend on electricity for something that is not specialized to mine crypto is stupid
3702 2018-12-12 16:06:38 These days are hard days for the crypto market when prices are falling deeply. But still a coin holds its value. It's the Nexty (NTY) that must have something new that can help it keep not prices from dropping like that. Learn more about it on twitter @Nextyio #crypto #nexty

3706 2018-12-12 16:06:21 With the smartstaking program, Nexty investors will always be profitable with a price stabilization system, even when the market goes down, Nexty will always stand firm in the market.

3712 2018-12-12 16:05:40 The electronic money market is falling deeply. But Nexty's prices are still stable, even up from last week. This proves that people have a lot of belief in Nexty and I think the future is not very far, Nexty can replace bitcoin. #crypto #nexty #bitcoin

3715 2018-12-12 16:05:26 Same question! What will you do when the market goes down. For me, I will buy Nexty (NTY), which is the best platform ever. It will help you get back what you have lost #crypto #nexty #bitcoin

3727 2018-12-12 16:03:54 The cryptographic market is unpredictable due to price fluctuations and in addition, outdated technology. With Nexty, you'll experience great features along with a stable price system that keeps prices steady at a certain level.

3775 2018-12-12 15:59:52 It's not bad news, Nick. And certainly not un-follow worthy. It's potentially good news. Potentially because there's a chance new management may embrace crypto, namely the leader in this field, Ripple. But certainly no guarantees. This is why I didn't understand the BOOM.
3776 2018-12-12 15:59:48 Instant transfer for 2 seconds with 1800tps. Is not it great ? Look at bitcoin when you take over an hour to get them and with eth is over 10 minutes  #crypto#nexty #bitcoin #BTC #NTY #Coin #nty
3777 2018-12-12 15:59:47 Would be the right thing imho. Thank you.

Doesn't excuse Ari's attempt to bribe him with insider trading. 
Doesn't excuse all the other people sending him racists slurs. 
Doesn't excuse people sitting by while it happened.
3821 2018-12-12 15:56:25 Technology is superior, especially the transfer fee is zero

3837 2018-12-12 15:54:54 You should consider investing in Nexty(NTY)
I sincerely hope that Nexty will still get the great support from the community to strengthen us in the long run

3838 2018-12-12 15:54:54 So basically what mati saying Correct me if I am wrong please , that if you purchased any crypto by debit or credit card you dnt own it , it is still CFD right ? Because if you can’t have control your underlying asset yourself you dnt own it right ?

This is a groundbreaking payment platform that integrates well with any other online retail platform #crypto #nexty #bitcoin #nty
3843 2018-12-12 15:54:24 Until the federal court decides whether XRP is a security or not, major  #crypto exchanges will likely not take the risk of integrating $XRP, even  if the exchanges believe XRP is not a security.

3847 2018-12-12 15:54:12 It's no 'assumption' - you stated very clearly: "XRP is a security". If it's because you're trying to influence the crypto currency market then I am referring this conversation to the proper authorities @SEC_News , @FINRA and the @CFTC

3856 2018-12-12 15:53:25 A great one from btcnews. Bitmax will attract top investors with this kind of articles.

3864 2018-12-12 15:52:43 I think that in 2019, the electronic currency has superior technology, practical applications will be more known and strong growth. Nexty Platform (NTY) with Instant transfer, Zero transfer fees, it is fully deserves the money of the future #crypto #nexty #bitcoin #nty
3865 2018-12-12 15:52:31 Previously i used Bitcoin to pay, i had to waste more than 1 minute for it to complete. When I knew nexty(NTY) I was really supprised at it's transaction speed. In less than 2 seconds, the money was in the account #crypto #nexty #bitcoin #nty
3866 2018-12-12 15:52:17 Nexty(NTY)is a great platform. To me, zero transfer fee is what i like best in nexty. With nexty payment online, u will have not to be about the expensive fees anymore, you will not have to pay fee more than 1usd when you buy a coffee less than 1usd #crypto #nexty#bitcoin #crypto
3867 2018-12-12 15:52:10 I'm sure most are in the same boat. My crypto PF peaked around 2400% & i only banked my risk x200%. I've just held most of what i have, want to keep some skin in crypto
3868 2018-12-12 15:52:08 yeah cuz you know someone telling you to insert his rather considerable male genitals into your mandible is more offensive than say an OG shilling all his followers to Zero. Let's all be civilized as we kill people right?! As a  guy, better for him to be humble than truthful
3869 2018-12-12 15:52:04 I will not hesitate to tell you that the nexty platform (NTY)  is the best platform today. Although it is currently not popular, but in the future, it will pass bitcoin to become the coinmarketcap leader. #crypto#nexty #bitcoin #nty

3901 2018-12-12 15:50:01 Hi  so would you tell me what’s the difference between  buying crypto from coin base UK by credit card and debit card and etoro ? Is coin base not obligated to comply by EU banking system ? I have purchase 20k ether from Coinbase with credit card and moved it to cold wallet !
3902 2018-12-12 15:49:51 Why RAZER Why. Crypto anything at this point is not a good idea.  Even if you prove a few positives, associating your company with mining is a horrible idea.  Just my opinion.  You do you!
3903 2018-12-12 15:49:49 Are you kidding? I heard it at 10, 8, 7, 6, 4, here. We haven't capitulated yet. You don't get a week too buy the bottom
3904 2018-12-12 15:49:47 Its a good tool applies to all types of risk that one may encounter. Always begin with thinking before acting on measures. No planed entry and exits are total gambles.. Some people fail to grasp how imp it is to really manage risks when handling money and resources.

3910 2018-12-12 15:49:24 ok mate. The potential of this vertical is certainly such that it can cater for a number of quality #crypto startups like this, so the more (good projects) the merrier imo.
3911 2018-12-12 15:49:22 A penny is worth a penny to bring it real value. Electronic money does not do that. But with Nexty Platform (NTY) real value will not be unfamiliar to potential investors #crypto #nexty#bitcoin #eth #coin #crypto #nty

3995 2018-12-12 15:42:20 Altcoins decoupled from BTC in early 2017 for no reason at all.  In fact, most of past crypto history alts served to hedge against falling BTC. Only recently did they start rising/falling together. I think more altcoin fiat pairings will be responsible for the next decoupling.

4078 2018-12-12 15:35:40 I am very familiar with these kind of statements you should see Allianz  start loading up on crypto very soon . Few months ago Goldman Sachs said the same thing "I will fire anyone that trades crypto in my office " two months later they form their own OTC trade bed. LOL

4083 2018-12-12 15:34:32 I've been around long enough to know this for a fact. It all comes down to looking for projects that are working towards real adoption. If you can see through the bullshit vaporware ones, its easy to pick future winners with a little research

So far, Nexty has grown up with many large communities. Join now for great investment opportunities #crypto #nexty
4100 2018-12-12 15:31:58 I know man.  Such a different beast when dealing with institutions where they have already given in to the facts that quants trade better than their best traders.  Imagine failing at crypto and thinking you are going to beat wall street.  Necc.

4105 2018-12-12 15:31:38 My timeline recently:

"#Bitcoin is dead"
"#crypto is done"
"Nobody needs #blockchain"
"#cryptocurrencies are scams" etc.

This makes me even more #bullish on the years to come, because I honestly believe crypto is here to stay & we're still here to experience its rise!

4128 2018-12-12 15:30:10 2019 will be year where #crypto regulation will continue to evolve. Regulators don’t want to stifle innovation, and yet they have responsibilities for consumer & investor protection. Look to see more threading of the needle between investor protection and facilitating innovation.
4129 2018-12-12 15:30:05 I do. I saw on the news recently that Republicans just got btfo in the midterms and Clinton and Kerry are dancing, something fatty McTrump has never done.

4130 2018-12-12 15:30:03 With the smartstaking program, Nexty investors will always be profitable with a price stabilization system, even when the market goes down, Nexty will always stand firm in the market.

4158 2018-12-12 15:26:54 No doubt, I understand fiat is largely flawed. But in order for crypto to be accepted as a currency, people need it to be at least somewhat stable. At this point that's a pipe dream. And if it doesn't get there.... that's decades away...

I can name quite a few PoW coins that got hit with double spent recently.

4169 2018-12-12 15:26:18 What I'm really surprised that blockchain has not capitalized on is provable fairness in gaming. I've been playing this one game for too long now and although it's a good idea there is rampant manipulation in the game.

4171 2018-12-12 15:26:15 I like when I read “I am 100 certain this will break down but I’m not going to short at this point” lol that’s like saying “i am 100% certain I have these winning numbers for the lottery but I’m not gonna play them.” Lol all talk in #crypto #btc #bitcoin
4172 2018-12-12 15:26:07 You often have trouble with eth, bitcoin on slow and expensive transfers, now you no longer worry about that anymore. The Nexty platform with great technology, is a product of intelligence with zero cash transfers and fast cash transfers . #crypto #nexty #bitcoin
4173 2018-12-12 15:26:01 Thanks for sharing, Justin! I worked really hard to make sure the crypto piece was clear and based on the feedback I’ve gotten I accomplished that.
4174 2018-12-12 15:25:56 the truth is too big to fail companies like his should be BANNED...Straight up, eat sh*t dude. No one is forcing you to be involved with crypto. These hit pieces are insane to me and so transparent at this point.
4175 2018-12-12 15:25:50 Problem solved.
4176 2018-12-12 15:25:47 While all crypto on conmarketcap fell sharply, the Nexty Platform remained firmly in the market. With a price stabilization system that helps investors avoid losing money in the project, coupled with the daily smartstaking profits will help you make more profit. #crypto #nexty

4179 2018-12-12 15:25:39 I can't believe anyone would ask why only to paying subs?! Bc we are PAYING subs. Some of us don't make a ton of money and are hoping to use crypto to better our lives financially. So I hope future knowledge comes to subscribers first and foremost.

4277 2018-12-12 15:17:14 Nexty(NTY)is a great platform. To me, zero transfer fee is what i like best in nexty.

4363 2018-12-12 15:10:25 Being the most accepted crypto asset is like being the most mobile quadriplegic. There is no compelling product market fit there unless users aren't required to dump their wealth into a highly volatile, speculative asset first.

4376 2018-12-12 15:09:13 Getting people to adopt crypto is a good thing but getting people to adopt crypto thinking they are buying Bitcoin when in fact they are buying bcash is deceptive. For that, I have no idea how you can say that would be worthy of respect.

4381 2018-12-12 15:08:53 Yawn. Heard that before from publishers, telecoms, record labels, cable networks and many brick & mortar retailers. Compared to those industries, insurance is like shooting fish in a barrel. Crypto is just another wave of tech disruption, nothing more.

4403 2018-12-12 15:06:40 So many “crypto enthusiasts” don’t even understand the benefits of having 10 minute block times as well as ~ 2 week difficulty adjustments... yeah downsides I guess that’s well known but to be a digital gold we need security as goal #1 before anything else $BTC

My addiction is directly correlated with the bear run. Lower prices=more research
4406 2018-12-12 15:06:12 The electronic money market is falling deeply. But Nexty's prices are still stable, even up from last week. This proves that people have a lot of belief in Nexty and I think the future is not very far, Nexty can replace bitcoin. #crypto #nexty #bitcoin

4478 2018-12-12 15:00:23 Vestx is a known scam coin who has close ties to several other pump and dump scam coins: DAPSX, Ondori and PXN.

Stay away folks! These are legitimately bad actors in our space, and they are the reason people fear coming into crypto.

4480 2018-12-12 15:00:17 Isn’t there a bigger debt bubble within crypto? Look at all these miners who get bust of high debts, poor retail investors who get just because the bought coins from mortgages?
4481 2018-12-12 15:00:10 Yep, but I’ll happily wait for the perfect time for them to drop the bomb. $BAT is literally only crypto I’m super comfortable holding. $BTC too but that’s it. Everything else still speculative vaporware
4482 2018-12-12 15:00:08 Everyone in my family thinks I’m insane, including my wife. So many people have no idea what the crypto space is trying to accomplish. They can laugh now but I think I’ll be laughing in a few years

4558 2018-12-12 14:54:58 If you are trying to invest in anything and the time frame is less than years it is likely the individual needs to adjust their expectations.

25% are dreamt of.

The fact that crypto produces 10 and 20x is ridiculous.

4622 2018-12-12 14:49:51 A penny is worth a penny to bring it real value. Electronic money does not do that. But with Nexty Platform (NTY) real value will not be unfamiliar to potential investors #crypto #nexty#bitcoin #eth #coin #crypto #nty
4623 2018-12-12 14:49:47 As much as I enjoyed the schadenfreude of watching a crypto coin cheerleader, I had to unfollow someone because they still back trump.

4628 2018-12-12 14:49:16 The electronic money market is falling sharply. We need a big enough dollar to replace the bitcoin and pull the market off the ground. I think NextyPlatform (NTY) is a great replacement for that #crypto#nexty #bitcoin #eth #coin #crypto
4629 2018-12-12 14:49:01 Just wait until the people using this here about actual crypto mining. Gonna be wild.

4635 2018-12-12 14:48:23 Well said, shut down your emotion is the key in crypto. When you can handle that and reacting in counter ways than the masses you will defenitly make gaines. Make your own decissions and learn from it.
4636 2018-12-12 14:48:07 Again a proof of stupidity in crypto. Tell me how you wanna do simple international business without short and long options???? How you wanna efficiently do to business with cash flows in the future? Damn, are these crypto’s stupid!

4642 2018-12-12 14:47:42 What is the 2019 trend? That is a real value in life. I think so, so I always believe in Nexty Platform(NTY) that will bring real value to everyone. It will be quickly put into daily payment with no transfer fee#crypto #nexty #bitcoin #nty

4648 2018-12-12 14:47:16 I've got swing orders at $2745, $2900, $2950 and $2995.
When price falls to $3000 level i think we'll slide right through into atleast $2900 areas before rebounding > $3k.
A quick drop below $3k to cause panic makes more sense than a solid satisfying bounce off $3k

4650 2018-12-12 14:47:07 I think there's a middle ground where experimental or associated code is useful. One justification is reproducibility, another that MPC/crypto is already very exclusive. Publishing code (and overview blog posts) helps.

4705 2018-12-12 14:41:15 I would be very surprised if this bullish momentum doesn't continue for the #crypto market (and the American indices don't decline simultaneously with $DXY) for at least most of today.
4706 2018-12-12 14:41:10 The community really did not like what I tried to achieve here. But that's fine, I'm already well within the industry doing lots of other stuff.

I think people just didn't like the name? Seems incredibly petty and vindictive if you ask me.

But this has if nothing been a lesson.
4707 2018-12-12 14:41:10 How is it over there? Too cold?
4708 2018-12-12 14:41:09 True, and you only need approx a 40% win rate to be highly profitable. Good risk:reward ratio (at least 1.5:1), proper stop-loss and due diligence to volume and price action. Basics that many fail. Math and averages win.

4785 2018-12-12 14:30:15 Im curious What the annual fee and interest rate will be. Also, I would imagine they would create their own crypto to give as a reward and even go so far to have a marketplace you can redeem “rewards” and what not
4786 2018-12-12 14:29:39 I didn't say I think it's fair. :) Just that the things can change. Also, the point about a crypto X going to value Y applies for all - most of them do nothing. If enabling instant settlement isn't good enough for you. then ok. :) But point taken. :)
4787 2018-12-12 14:29:37 If XRP is technically sold to rather than held by the 3rd party marketmaker, would that further limit their liability? Unlike most crypto outsfits Ripple has been in constant contact with regulators since 2013. Might they claim tacit regulatory permission to sell unregistered XRP

4830 2018-12-12 14:24:41 I think we underestimate the effect new trends can have on society. The trend itself that young people and trendsetters addapt often get’s mass adopted. Even tough paying with app is not new, the tech, trend and the experience doing it with crypto is different.

4870 2018-12-12 14:20:15 Very true because there is actually no value on any crypto, it’s worthless and any profit is pure luck. So if by chance you can sell at a profit and are not a risk trader...never buy any again
4871 2018-12-12 14:20:03 Bitcoin is probably is the “56K dial up modem” phase right now. You would have to be naive to think that this tech will not be be further developed. Where there’s money to be made you will continue to see development and further market expansion.
4872 2018-12-12 14:19:38 looks like he just sharted
4873 2018-12-12 14:19:18 Nothing new in regards to innovation. In the past, people trashed talked the internet, phones, TV's, etc. I bet that in the future, everyone involved in crypto will be sitting on a rocking chair, talking to their grand kids about the times when crypto prices were dirt cheap.
4874 2018-12-12 14:19:16 You could be right but I'll take the other side of the bet. I believe selling is almost finished and 'new' crypto money is already positioning itself for 2019.
4875 2018-12-12 14:18:55 Buying more today ...
4876 2018-12-12 14:18:46 I would like the exchange @BittrexExchange to accept deposits via @NETELLER to buy bitcoin.

or the netteller itself let out in crypto.

4907 2018-12-12 14:15:03 Starting to put together New Years resolution options.  At the top, is culling my social media of: parents who over post, essential oil sellers, and crypto trolls.  But who would be left?
4908 2018-12-12 14:14:57 I'm taking a break from #Crypto Twitter today. There is nothing going on and I like to share new things, not parrot others. #btc #cryptolife #disconnect #patience
4909 2018-12-12 14:14:43 Crypto is a finance system created for people with no idea how finance works based on contract technology for people who have no idea how the legal system works.

I mean how could it ever have gone wrong?
4910 2018-12-12 14:14:32 Yep glad I didn't touch any of those.

I'm actually potentially interested in crypto now about 3months out once all this crap/scam stuff goes away and all the dumb $ is gone, there might be some potential use cause. Not holding my breath though.

4915 2018-12-12 14:14:05 If your $crypto @Twitter account got suspended, and you had a bunch of value stored in tipbot accounts you controlled, isn't that like a bank freezing you out & keeping your money? Is that illegal, or user's risk according to TOU? Could one sue for one's coins back?

4933 2018-12-12 14:12:15 Make sure you toggle the slide button that says "hide small token balances". I think if you have less than 50 token of something it will automatically not display. Also, try logging out and back into your wallet one minute later to refresh the balances.

4939 2018-12-12 14:11:20 Ari just admitted to getting @kazonomics whacked cuz he was a problem.
4940 2018-12-12 14:11:20 Probably a good idea. One of the reasons I joined crypto was simply the belief that barrier to entry was low and easy compared to stocks. I was possibly wrong but the new generation might have the same idea.
4941 2018-12-12 14:10:21 3 things I'm very bullish on:

1. African based tech (e.g. Jumia, mobile networks)
2. Well funded medical marijuana co's
3. Non-US based crypto
4942 2018-12-12 14:10:19 Can't wait for mainstream crypto solutions.
4943 2018-12-12 14:10:17 that’s just noise. people get scammed out of billions and billions every year. i personally wouldn’t use that as an indicator of anything more than crypto is popular enough that people will buy into terrible projects.

4945 2018-12-12 14:10:06 We need ban all crypto, except #bitcoin. 
4946 2018-12-12 14:09:21 It’s fun to know one fact about US dollar. For real it’s only bunch of speculation and loan bills without real material worth.
4947 2018-12-12 14:09:19 Until some demonstrates a frictionless and easy-to-use system for using crypto to pay for things and execute contracts. You’ll know the bull run is coming when the big fish like JPMorgan jump back in.

4962 2018-12-12 14:06:59 and yes being centralized means alot, the whole point of crypto is to do away with this old outdated system where bankers control when and where you can spend your money. Moving crypto to another centralized system run by the same corrupt people doesn't get us anywhere!

4968 2018-12-12 14:05:52 Most Bitcoin that is sold is held on exchanges in usd credits, exchanges like binance don’t even have fiat rails.. so when sentiment shifts from fear to greed, traders roll their sideline fiat back into crypto and gamblers start opening margin long positions

4978 2018-12-12 14:05:09 Keeping the nerve with bullion purchases in a volatile 2018 is now paying off. Who says gold has lost its place as a safe haven asset. Don't see crypto reacting in same way.

4988 2018-12-12 14:04:17 Yeah it should be of critical concern... gov’ts who don’t adapt crypto, especially ones in Africa, will be operating in a sub-optimum financial system. It’s funny how you see people scrambling to find any way they can to stop this movement. Good luck

5049 2018-12-12 13:56:02 LOL Legend??? You mean scammer, its called price manipulation and insider trading. Charlie will never buy back in because LTC is a shitcoin and will never go back to its ath just like 99% of crypto.

5051 2018-12-12 13:55:50 It's obvious to me that crypto is on the agenda. McAfee is invited to give the appearance of an listened to expert, but actually is there only to lend the event credibility.
5052 2018-12-12 13:55:46 Very similar to $onion
5053 2018-12-12 13:55:42 That and greed. I’ve put 10s of thousands in crypto never once withdrew any. If I day trade and profit I just use it to continue to trade. I do the same in the stock market. Everyone wants that $1 million.
5054 2018-12-12 13:55:40 First u have to have an wallet/account either on ur computer or mobile device with address where you can accept #crypto , in this case #Ethereum_Ice  Once u have that then someone can send you that #crypto - I have not heard of this #crypto before today so I need to research

5072 2018-12-12 13:53:41 Transaction speed is only one of many aspects that determines how good a crypto is or isn’t. 

Less than 4 seconds already feels really fast. 

And when XRP gets the cobalt upgrade it will reduce transaction time to around 1 second. How much faster does a transaction need to be?

5074 2018-12-12 13:53:27 There’s also a crypto-bro willful ignorance about the social elements of trust, and how the general belief that the court system delivers fair outcomes most of the time that keeps the trust in it—you can get your day in court.

Very little crypto understanding of this.

5080 2018-12-12 13:52:38 The best part of  #crypto, is that nobody asked  me any questions or placed a barrier on who can access the #cryptocurency, #Nexty has done that and more by allowing people of all races to access a top notch payment platform
5081 2018-12-12 13:52:35 @Cgj_Crypto why arent you laughing anymore?
5082 2018-12-12 13:52:33 This sounds like a huge deal. So basically will be trending towards a deflationary proces. But isnt that going to lead to economic meltdown? Slowdown of economic activity?  Controlled demolition?
5083 2018-12-12 13:52:28 Crypto performing better than Market in breakout.  Short interest does not enter Market above these levels until Friday before France's weekend activities.  After this weekend short interest will not enter Markets worldwide in my lifetime again unless we break 52-week lows.
5084 2018-12-12 13:52:21 I agree. 100% are over confident because they have always won throughout their lives. Always getting the trophy, patted on the back, parents watching every move and helping them to perfection. It’s wearing on me as I see way too much of this in the crypto world.
5085 2018-12-12 13:52:14 How did crypto do back then?
5086 2018-12-12 13:52:08 and many more... good initiative 
5087 2018-12-12 13:52:07 In a deployed system where people already hold tokens, increasing divisibility isn't at all equivalent to minting new coins. Increasing divisibility greatly rewards the original holders, so much so that it is likely infeasible.

5125 2018-12-12 13:44:29 The problem with #Bitcoin forks is that, no matter how much better than #BTC they actually are, they never become the king of the hill, because people will always stick with the original. However, we're going live soon, with an original #crypto. And it will be #NoBitcoinFuture.

5128 2018-12-12 13:43:54 Exactly. Why do you think so many of us are getting loud on the matter ? EToro represents everything that makes crypto trading look dodgy to common people. They hide behind a bunch of legal nonsense and rip people off in broad daylight.

5175 2018-12-12 13:38:32 What is a good idea in #crypto? You hear all kinds of beautiful feautures by various projects buyt the must important question for me has always be is it really useful then is applicable, but question that #nexty has answered perfectly, I’m investiong heavily in this.
5176 2018-12-12 13:38:22 The difference between a “blockchain” and a “crypto” is a community.

5179 2018-12-12 13:38:00 Claiming that crypto is nothing more than money is like claiming back in 2007 that the iPhone would be nothing more than a thing to make phone calls with.

Cryptonetworks unlock a new paradigm for computation. Money just happens to be their most obvious application.

5193 2018-12-12 13:35:18 Crypto world needs an healthy crash with disappearance of coins such as $BTG $BCD $BCN $XVG and other shitcoins.

5196 2018-12-12 13:35:09 Do you know if they cashed out the ICO money in to fiat or did they leave it all in ETH? That’s the big question I guess. If it’s in cash then none of this is a problem to them. Do you know any way to find this out?

5329 2018-12-12 13:16:30 The same investigation should be done for most top 30 shit coins. Make it a reality show with cameras and a celebrity host that confront these clowns

5357 2018-12-12 13:12:17 An inflationary crypto is needed  for mainstream adoption. Otherwise why would people spend a crypto in daily use whose value will increase over time. Inflationary nature will motivate people to spend it and not hoard it like gold. Remember 10000 Bitcoin pizza?
5358 2018-12-12 13:12:14 Plan is the same as it’s always been: don’t have the time, capital or knowledge to trade with the big boys. Decide which coins are worth investing in and hold them over next few years. Very boring but would be silly for me to even consider trading as I watch so many try. #crypto

5486 2018-12-12 12:53:47 You mustn't have seen their recent announcement then Joseph. They said they were exploring the addition of XRP to Coinbase Pro (their main exchange), as well as another 30 digital assets. This tweet of yours is simply wrong. Have a look through their recent tweets.
5487 2018-12-12 12:53:42 But to your original Q. For investors, it's attractive because of an accumulation of things. The Ripple team is a more dedicated, strategic team than any other in crypto. They have had a big picture plan since day one and have been executing it flawlessly. They trust the process.

but inflation of the M1 monetary supply (which it sounds like you are referring to) and CPI (consumer price index, which measures the purchasing power over time of the USD) are not synonymous, though there is correlation at times

5595 2018-12-12 12:35:46 Exactly. It is about a asset which isn't correlating and proofed his stability. Bitcoin isn't matching any of this parameters. In a major recession people are looking to keep their capital, not to make even more risk Trades. This would be the total gambel and nothing else.

5613 2018-12-12 12:31:02 The average #XRP transfer fee is a fraction of a penny. It’s dirt cheap to move XRP.

If you are holding crypto long term, offline is the safest way to do it. 

The point of my post was if you can’t withdrawal your XRP, you don’t actually own the xrp. 

No keys = no ownership

5636 2018-12-12 12:26:29 If/when governments & businesses decide to go to crypto they will attempt it as Chris says. Only seriously inflated egos would imagine it would be with the BSV protocol. Seriously why wouldn’t they simply spin up their own?
5637 2018-12-12 12:26:28 Practically speaking you don't need to own crypto to have it improve your life. For average consumers the shift should feel seemless with a pleasant reduction in settlement time/fees for SMBs, less credit friction for consumers, etc. It's just a better widget - nothing to resist
5638 2018-12-12 12:26:09 Lol. This is the funniest news I've read about crypto. BTC mining is not the cause of environmental problems, and price drop won't solve it. It's those morons who keep stealing lands from #indigenous people turning them into industrial and commercial zones.
5639 2018-12-12 12:26:07 Lol. DDSS scores. What a scam this guy is caught up in. Yeah hold that drgn. Just like they want u to

5643 2018-12-12 12:25:29 They regularly change their names over the centuries. Its what Crypto's do and are all about. Secrets and secret societies to keep you dumbed down under control
5644 2018-12-12 12:25:21 おめでとう
5645 2018-12-12 12:24:58 Hell yeah TRX doing big things to promote the crypto space!!
5646 2018-12-12 12:24:24 I hope so. I will then get it all. Such a good project bro.....
5647 2018-12-12 12:24:21 The only conspiracy is the one you took part in the biggest shake out in crypto history
5648 2018-12-12 12:24:09 “few” businesses who accept crypto is not “none”, so if they say they’ve found one, in a specific town where they’ve made other grants, your testimony about overall rarity doesn’t really question their claim
5649 2018-12-12 12:24:08 I like fluid exit plans like a loss of an hourly uptrend with high low and higher highs shifting to lower highs and lower lows
5650 2018-12-12 12:23:12 Why don't you also try telling that to the yellow vests, Greeks and Italians

5659 2018-12-12 12:21:40 This low cap vs high cap argument has to be the dumbest one. Especially in a sheep’s point of view “ these coins will 100x , while others will never see that because the amount in circulation” you do realize pump n dumps are mainly orchestrated on low cap coins? Be smart. #Crypto

5676 2018-12-12 12:19:12 In the EU, the whole point is to prevent tax payers bailing out the banks following the financial crash in 2008. Instead, the regulators have the power to write down, cancel or convert to equity the obligations of the financial institution i.e., it’s creditors get screwed.

5685 2018-12-12 12:18:10 Fiat is issued by a government that can tax its citizens (that is what give it value) Crypto doesn’t have that benefit.  If crypto is to become a thing (really) it will be issued by the reserve.  Asking for a price prediction is not stupid. Being defensive is very stupid.

5687 2018-12-12 12:18:02 Otherwise, this is just kind of like upwork yet being paid in crypto -- where the only innovation is the payment provider.
5688 2018-12-12 12:17:50 100% still, if it’s non profit, is it tax-exempted? That’d help a lot. 
If I help @ethBounties by submitting a translation, then cash out, should i invoice? Get taxed? We’re still really early so as long as this is a gray area in crypto in general, this will affect the bounties

5733 2018-12-12 12:12:22 IMO these #Altcoins are not worth putting your hard earned money into. The only thing to buy is $BTC and $ETH when they hit the bottom-and that might be in January.

That would put $btc at a low of $1,600. 

And then to 20x its prior high?

5904 2018-12-12 11:48:57 your troll game is weak bloomberg, bitcoin isnt itself A bubble, there was a huge spike due to hype and this was a correction based around multiple factors in the market bch being suspect #1, there is still a limited supply so there is no speculation, it will continue upwards

5918 2018-12-12 11:47:29 I think Tether will withstand this competition and keep its leading position. Though it is going to be very exciting to watch and see which one of opponents will get closer to it.
5919 2018-12-12 11:47:26 XRP will replace Bitcoin
5920 2018-12-12 11:47:05 That's pretty accurate though. What's happening RN in crypto is the greatest corporate day light Robbery.

5924 2018-12-12 11:46:41 Yes. That's how blockchain works. Though it's still really early days for crypto and a lot of things are still under construction and education needs to be improved for all.

5976 2018-12-12 11:38:56 It's unclear in which direction we're going but yesterday's close in the range wasn't bullish. I'll just play the range as a range (without bias) and see where we end up.

5991 2018-12-12 11:36:51 The timing of the news again underlines the fact that despite the  well-documented woes of the #crypto market, a number of  influential businesses like Samsung and HTC believe that cryptocurrencies and #blockchain technology will be key growth drivers  going forward.
5992 2018-12-12 11:36:48 También estoy en contacto con @ethBounties, proyecto que tiene por finalidad canalizar campañas ecológicas, sociales, etc. Sería una buena herramienta para acercarse a los colegios/adolescentes. En una misma acción creas conciencia ecológica y los capacitás en crypto.
5993 2018-12-12 11:36:45 Coinbase -> Digital Currency Group -> Zcash, DNT, Brave & more. Coming soon: Decentraland, Civic, XRP, ANT. Way more large-scale things are going on here played by top-level crypto mafia. And you don`t have to be Sherlock to investigate that.

5996 2018-12-12 11:36:08 How are we feeling short-term right now for BTC? Where do we get first?
5997 2018-12-12 11:36:00 It means that you cannot send crypto back to the eToro legacy trading platform. Accepting deposits in crypto is an AML nightmare that we hope to crack one day.

For now, the wallet app does allow deposits and withdrawal of crypto assets.
5998 2018-12-12 11:35:30 Nexo received tokens as loan repayments.  That value can only be used to fund further loans if they are sold.  Nexo could liquidate on the market and pay us in ETH as you would have, or, let each investor decide.  The later choice means fewer tokens will be liquidated.
5999 2018-12-12 11:35:27 The good old cycle of market movements . People say TA between crypto and traditional market don't match but  it isn't what assets you  trade it's human psychology and people are stoopid  so yeah stay safe do r get #REKT

6064 2018-12-12 11:24:31 Thank you Crypto. I'm glad my report cards have some value in them.

I don't use anchored VWAP but now that more and more people are adding this to there analysis including SMB (indicating that big players are using it) I think it is worth while adding the anchored feature
6065 2018-12-12 11:24:22 Bitcoins a lot like infinite jesus... just dying and being resurrected again & again... to pay for the sins of the #Crypto doubters
6066 2018-12-12 11:24:19 Stablecoins if connected to local payment systems would enable an international venmo that bypasses SWIFT and other closed loop payment networks like Paypal. It is not volatile like other crypto, but just as fast for settlements, and yes, can convert directly with dollars b&f
6067 2018-12-12 11:24:17 Hey @SyedSaddiq A wild question appears! What is your political/personal opinion on cryptocurrency? Legal? Illegal? Regulated? Ban? Do you personally support legalization of eg. Bitcoin or "haram all fake money"? [Current data shows crypto is "Alegal" in Malaysia]

6070 2018-12-12 11:24:11 I am not sure I would hope so since this is very important to the whole crypto market so if anything CNBC should be covering it, but I haven't seen any announcements about it.

6079 2018-12-12 11:22:18 If a bank runs out of liquid money, it causes a domino effect. If the Bank is big enough, like the Lehman Brothers bank in 2008, it can collapse the system... but the government will just bail the banks out. Loaning money that doesn't exist, with interest is toxic in long term.

6103 2018-12-12 11:19:52 People won’t want to be paying a mortgage in a deflationary currency either. However, that by itself should be a measure that incentivizes people from going into long term debt. I don’t know how this crypto experiment will work but I trust it more than central banks.

6124 2018-12-12 11:16:58 Exactly. Central Banks give out $100 and want $110 back with interest. So the state needs to take up another 10$ to pay back the original debt. Ponzi af!

6151 2018-12-12 11:11:51 The simple answer to this is, there is more debt in the world financial system than there is money to actually pay for it. Total debt exceeds total cash and money in bank accounts. The debt comes with interest as well. Fractional reserve banking needs constant bailouts.

6163 2018-12-12 11:09:19 Most people/businesses would convert crypto payments to fiat through exchanges. The conversion rates would leave you with pretty much the same amount (more or less). Not bashing crypto payments, I'm a supporter, but this is just a fact.

6193 2018-12-12 11:04:33 As long as you need to commit data to a ledger you will always leak some information though. The question is wether you can stay ahead of blockchain forensics. It’s true zk-snarks seems way more promising in that regard, but it brings other issues related to setup/exotic crypto.
6194 2018-12-12 11:04:09 Isn't it a good sign? If a coin is hated on twitter, it oughta pump hard. Everyone was trashing ADA and XRP and they were among those who pumped the hardest in jan...

6209 2018-12-12 11:00:56 $BCH and $BSV managed to exactly split their community, their hash-power and the price of their tokens and by the way damaged the whole crypto-market. Well done @ProfFaustus and @rogerkver. You know how to destroy a project!
6210 2018-12-12 11:00:53 This does not imply that they are accomplices, those who have been cheated will have to go up to the truth.

Of course I can say that all this circle of crypto-twitter, help each other to increase their "rank" and many times they quote each other advising who to follow

6216 2018-12-12 11:00:04 The only way for a direct transaction with crypto via cards will be depending on the POS system that is build around crypto. We still have a long way to go. But current crypto card is a way to start off the revolution - like what has been said, a technology bridge.

6225 2018-12-12 10:58:54 The only true crypto currency is Bitcoin. Everything else is a crappy copy.
Bitcoin obtained no ones permission to start, and needs no ones permission to continue. So by your definition, the best and 1st crypto, is not a true crypto. Good luck with that.
6226 2018-12-12 10:58:42 Isn’t 3k where Jamie bought last year?  Won’t go lower
6227 2018-12-12 10:58:32 Okey, I have so many (too many) trash bags to keep track of and the only person I’ve come across who does updates on projects is @DARKNESS_CRYPTO (absolute champion and a must follow ) Is there anyone else who regularly does updates on what’s happening around the place?

6251 2018-12-12 10:54:45 1500 BTC ?! they seem really so many!

I'm not saying that they should not give it to them, if one is a good trader he has so many clients that give him so many BTCs, but for someone like him, I've never considered him so good ...
6252 2018-12-12 10:54:15 It’s very likely 2019 could have multiple 100% gain swings off the lows in #BTC , #ETH , and other large cap #crypto and 2019 still be in a bear market for most of the year. Get off your 5 minute charts and look at the weekly and monthly more. Have a plan.

6336 2018-12-12 10:39:55 What will happen to our crypto-coins now?What's the point of accepting deposit while there is a problem going on
6337 2018-12-12 10:39:36 As much as I love crypto, no, not really... That's typical French populism, the french version of what you're witnessing *now* in the US. France is unfortunately victim of its past where Revolution is the answer to any problem
6338 2018-12-12 10:39:22 Yeah, people trying to get out of altcoins when there is not enough liquidity on exchanges
6339 2018-12-12 10:38:45 How was this promoted on the IoM? As designer of a crypto-currency IoT micro-payments technology I didn't know this was happening. Might have attended @MarkLewin_IOMG

6342 2018-12-12 10:38:14 Two interesting developments this year. 1. SEC is emphasising decentralisation as a criteria for crypto assets not be securities. Ie only ‘good’ crypto assets are legal. 2 Australia’s decryption bill means we really need to use open source software to stay safe.

6365 2018-12-12 10:33:55 It’s not about pumping anything. It’s about looking for assets with a history of non-correlation (gold eg) and potental new assets (btc eg)expressing similar traits in search for superior yield. 

Bond traders have already been off-risking, as evident by inverted yield curves.

6400 2018-12-12 10:26:20 People often think that crypto cycles come with trends, but it is trends that are generated by halving market shocks. When they finally realize it, the chance to become rich in crypto will diminish. There's high chance this will not happen.

6465 2018-12-12 10:14:11 The expectation is not that you work forever and free, I think the whole community would have supported when you receive some funds for your work also from IF. The problem is that you used the donations partially for work that you now develop as your own for-profit project.

6477 2018-12-12 10:12:20 Thx, don’t you think there will be severe ramifications  for the economy ?
6478 2018-12-12 10:11:58 And if it’s a bottom, it’s very unrealistic that it would stay at this range for so long. After previous bear markets, when it bottomed, it started to go upwards, not sideways. Also too many things will happen in 2019, so should be some action

6481 2018-12-12 10:11:24 Ich habe es zum ersten mal gesehen. Deswegen direkt hier gewarnt. Ja die denken sich immer wieder was neues aus. Problem ist dass am Ende die Anfänger oft sagen "ich habe mein Geld wegen #bitcoin verloren"
6482 2018-12-12 10:11:13 Funny how #BTCP is quickly becoming more popular with the whales but, no one wants to admit it. We've made the most improvements in least amount of time and we possess the best Zk-snark technology.  #WEAREBTCP #CRYPTO #tech #privacy #BITCOIN @bitcoinprivate #bitcoin
6483 2018-12-12 10:10:55 Figure is for an 'average' transaction. Sadly crypto is not very clean right now, but the optimist in me hopes that adoption and tech evolution will follow history of other inventions and become cleaner over time, eventually could even expedite cleaner energy for the masses.
6484 2018-12-12 10:10:08 Many trading platforms charge excessively for lending in ratio to the amount of time a client holds a margin position for financial transactions such as loans. Bitozz aims to surrogate this with a one time fee analogous to spot trading.

6486 2018-12-12 10:09:21 Crypto is a solution looking for a problem. Fact is.....for the masses fiat works perfectly. Who would want to deal with the crypto price fluctuations to actually use it for a regular spend?
6487 2018-12-12 10:08:52 細かい額のビットコインを大量に受け取っていると（例えば，1時間ごとに自動受信する形のハイプで）「過去に受信した多くの小規模な決済を統合する必要」のために，送金手数料があとで多額になる可能性があるような気がします。

6526 2018-12-12 10:02:30 I'm someone who strongly believes in buying crypto in firesales after a disaster. Some of the best buys I made were after hacks, exploits and scares.  Smartcash is no different. It is a coin that was trading much higher. The value is likely to return.
6527 2018-12-12 10:02:29 Glad to write to one of the Eco projects in crypto space!!
6528 2018-12-12 10:02:23 If you already have crypto currency, it make sense to sell it and top up MCO card to spend. Buying crypto with 3% fees and top up card to spend is not worth. Any suggestions?

6626 2018-12-12 09:43:33 it's not reflection of human psychology...it's institutional Christmas... this year they kill #BTC another time...and without any #btc supply they push the price down... 21M bitcoin... ppl are in the abyss with sharks selling their btc cheap...

6629 2018-12-12 09:42:57 @RBI Why do you have such a rift with crypto? Very few in crypto are dealing drugs, funding terrorism and laundering money.  Most of them use cash. Don't be such a luddite, get with the times. #india #Bitcoin #newcurrency
6630 2018-12-12 09:42:52 I didn't say that
6631 2018-12-12 09:42:49 So why did you do it @eToro have you fallen into the crypto trash talk like fast money. Dam shame as we all thought you where better than that. #XRP
6632 2018-12-12 09:42:38 never heard such a bullshit. You got  a professionell tunnel vision. If we see a major recession, people and investors will cover their basic needs. They are not going to pump BTC. Recession ->  cash positions-> huge opportunity in stock market

6640 2018-12-12 09:40:37 What is #crypto?

A chance to make or lose huge amounts of money on a highly volatile market.
A new technology that will either change our lives or die unknown.
Either kill or be killed by FIAT.

6657 2018-12-12 09:37:01 $BTC dropped in proce in the last 24 hours and tested the lows. However,
It qas made on a very low volume and couldnt break previous lows.

This is an indication of a possible reversal

Also everyone on twitter is bearish and no one is left to sell

I think we are due a #Pump
6658 2018-12-12 09:36:00 ちょっとえっちな…
6659 2018-12-12 09:34:54 People who use it as their main source of income should genuinely be taxed through the ass for it. It would also push more people to crypto so win win.
6660 2018-12-12 09:34:52 Tabloid journalism at its worst. An ill-educated interviewer clearly out of his depth regarding quantitative market analysis of Crypto. Rather than 'discuss' he's more interested in bashing @APompliano @MarkYusko. The tactic worked though, I watched the damn show

6662 2018-12-12 09:34:49 So we now know the original objectives for having Crypto go mainstream, used by the World and the poor are now fucked, as the powers at be, have accumulated majority of BTC, so aside from the tech, it's literally now all about making a profit from Crypto!

6725 2018-12-12 09:21:14 Saying that I do believe blockchain and a government backed crypto will happen at some point. Natural technological evolution. But the higher powers will win, I hope I’m wrong though.
6726 2018-12-12 09:21:06 Indeed.. When you notice all the progress @RestartEnergyio made this year.. $mwat will be decoupled from $btc when the plateform will be launched
6727 2018-12-12 09:20:44 Does it matter? Its their business, so they can list what they want. For some reason they like ERC20s, but XRP they dislike. I agree with them. Ripple has pretty much come out and said they are a security, which is fine, but its not what most of us crypto people think is "crypto"

6741 2018-12-12 09:19:14 Not really the same comparing Airbnb and Uber to fiat which is regulated and controlled by government. Governments don’t control cabs or the tourism sector.

6747 2018-12-12 09:18:36 It's exactly like the 1800s Gold rush in America. You had smart people exploring and finding valuable commodity. Then you had toothless drunks who just sat in a tavern talking about what everyone else was doing.
6748 2018-12-12 09:18:19 I believe that crypto is oversold at these prices.

6761 2018-12-12 09:15:35 Then you have to take into account that you are also limited by the laws that govern the place of residence declared in N26. No hope other than digital-native payment systems i.e. crypto:-)

6826 2018-12-12 09:02:06 You know what’s really sad about crypto is that once we get rid of Bitfinex, we’ll still have to excise the Binancer before $BTC gets healthy again.
6827 2018-12-12 09:01:57 VET is my heaviest bag by far, and yet the one that gives me the least of worries (except I’d like it to be bigger ) stay strong and enjoy the ride!

6898 2018-12-12 08:49:03 Can't justify the hype and scams. But unlike May, I think regulated exchanges with KYC, etc (if crypto exchanges are even still around in 2 years) can co-exist with some of cypherpunk ideals. Dollars are traded on exchanges, but paper money retains its privacy characteristics.

6900 2018-12-12 08:48:38 At this stage of my acquaintance with the project I can say that I was surprised by the idea of a global expansion in the future and a huge coverage in the future.

6910 2018-12-12 08:47:23 I really want to get into GPU mining, but the cost of a eg. 6x 1080Ti rig would be around $4000. According to whattomine, at 0.05 $/kWh, the best profit I can make is $1.96 per day (Ravencoin). Thats 5 years just to pay off the rig. I'm sure I must be missing something...
6911 2018-12-12 08:47:21 You should also show the #crypto supply curve the past few years.  That shit would be VERTICAL.

6913 2018-12-12 08:47:02 I hope that you do not waste your time and you are already reading about promising crypto currency. Do not miss your time and your opportunity.
6914 2018-12-12 08:47:01 When it comes to cryptocurrencies mining, I'm just a newbie in the game but one thing I have decided to do in 2019 & which i have already started this year is to pick any crypto that I can lay my hands on. All might not be successful in future but many are promising.

6917 2018-12-12 08:46:20 #Bitcoin becomes an extremely strong competitor of 'official' money and state monopoly to issue money in countries where governments failed to implement sound economic and monetary policy. Venezuela is a good example.

6919 2018-12-12 08:46:14 non, mais intéressant d'investir dans les technologie de crypto et autres
6920 2018-12-12 08:46:08 This is not my strong suit so I can't tell for sure. But I've tried to buy, say Google stocks, and can't without going through a licensed broker or something like that. So crypto is more like Forex in that sense afaik
6921 2018-12-12 08:45:59 そっちはビットコインキャッシュだ。ビットコインのビッグブロックの思想を引き継いだハードフォーク通貨になる。ムーア法則に則って無限にブロック容量が増えていく…って言っても初心者は分からないから、とりあえず、思想の違うビットコインって考えて良いぞ。

6964 2018-12-12 08:39:29 Yea most mainsteam places, but as far as video/streaming creators and smaller websites they're using crypto for donations more and more and getting the ones not currently using it, to use it, shouldn't be difficult

6981 2018-12-12 08:34:10 > fiat is winning and crypto is losing

You said that ..

Crypto is loosing due to a lack of a platform that is both STABLE and ALLOWS SCALE

BCH already lost on that as it proved to be NOT STABLE.

Serious builders/investors are on BSV now.
Only crackheads left at BCH ...

XRP is the future of worldwide payments.

All this mass adoption and institutional talk pales in comparison to this point: you are holding a p2p asset only you have access to unless you give someone access to it.
7091 2018-12-12 08:19:11 well futures markets have been a bad thing for crypto thus far.  BUT they also came on the scene last dec at the top of the run.  so it's been nothing but down since. i am not in the camp they are bad.  i think it's good long term. but yeah, doesn't mean much short term

Victory and defeat are an integral part of life. 

Today’s results will further our resolve to serve people and work even harder for the development of India.
7193 2018-12-12 08:03:41 Congratulations to the Congress for their victories.

7200 2018-12-12 08:02:57 BrianLockhart k33ple4rn1ng Lol, me and my wife have actually been watching The Great British Bake Off - one of the most wholesome shows on TV!
7201 2018-12-12 08:02:57 Pladizow Rather than looking for support lines, in bear markets I like to look for bottoming patterns. In 2014-15 the bottoming cup and handle was much more clear than some support line going back to 2013.
7202 2018-12-12 08:02:56 Pladizow All interactions are imprecise and very concentrated in time, so little evidence that traders are using this line as reference. We have to be careful about confirmation bias here (see what we want to see).
7203 2018-12-12 08:02:56 EJPharmD Exactly right.
7204 2018-12-12 08:02:55 Pladizow This is not valid TA imo (not enough support points). Also: horizontal lines tend to generate much more reliable signals.

What other asset has use case that can match XRP - certainly not Bitcoin - it's use case was forced to change from a 'payment currency' to 'a store of value' - not that good at it

7220 2018-12-12 08:00:30 General hierarchy of decision making

BTC vs equities. Then BTC vs crypto. 

Imo crypto wins in the long term, then btc, then equities. Short term is always a ? mark.

Regardless from an allocation decision you have to decide which of those three you like, why, & for what horizon

7249 2018-12-12 07:53:36 As Jacob said the collapse was delayed, by reducing interest rates to sub zero and bailing out the banks with taxpayer money. The debt is still there. You will know when there is a real collapse: civil war, blackouts, mass starvation. Civilization is fragile.
7250 2018-12-12 07:53:29 XRP is as powerful as crypto regarding speed, that's it. But it strengthen the FIAT systems... That's it.

7311 2018-12-12 07:42:32 reasonable chance they mean "crypto" as in "cryptocurrency," but who knows.
7312 2018-12-12 07:42:09 Got it... I see what you said now, sorry. That's exactly my point to @Crypto_STEEZ tweet. It's getting more and more difficult to ignore looking at the "new ones".
7313 2018-12-12 07:42:03 Lol 

I guess you hold one if the shit coins.
No.  Im coding a crypto app, and was updating exchange listings.

It's a pretty good indicator of community interest.....

7316 2018-12-12 07:41:36 Well, that was tough
7317 2018-12-12 07:41:29 Like I said. It was jus an opinion. We all make our own way in dis world. Especially in crypto. If I had 2 choose a group of people 2 follow, right 2 da very end of this shit show. U wud be front middle & centre. No ifs ands or buts. Nothing but positive vibes for u Mr Beak..
7318 2018-12-12 07:41:14 Crypto funds closing down.  More of this coming soon,  capitulation wicks.   Have  super low buy orders for your favorite coins.  Probably you'll get the buys of a lifetime hahaha.  $eng
7319 2018-12-12 07:41:05 

No doubt you'd advocate for diversified bags of alts as your monetary Swiss army knife in a post apocalyptic Mad Max world.
7320 2018-12-12 07:41:03 My 2 cents. Dec18&19 the FOMC will most likely hike rates. The bear market will continue in the stock exchange. During the bear market crypto will be used to diversify portfolios and once again be used on futures exchanges. Crypto will rise with time, but it will be a bumpy road.

7458 2018-12-12 07:17:55 The collapse happened and rates were dropped in a response to stimulate the economy.Dropping rates is still possible the US ten year has been roughly 3% for a lot of this year. Rates were higher in 08 so the policy would probably be more effective back then

7469 2018-12-12 07:16:38 I think we can separate “crypto currencies” and “infrastructure protocols”. We will see crypto currencies like BTC (most likely winner) operate on infrastructure protocols like ETH (most likely winner). Then we will see a new wave of dApps operating in this new ecosystem.

7474 2018-12-12 07:15:34 Bitcoin’s dominance is ruining crypto. Projects with working products and use cases are getting REKT because of this dinosaur. Forks like BCHABC and BSV show you how much Proof-of-Work coins are controlled by miners. POS is the future

7495 2018-12-12 07:11:37 I've developed a new open source P2P e-cash system called Bitcoin. It's completely decentralized, with no central server or trusted parties, because everything is based on crypto proof instead of trust. Give it a try, or take a look at the screenshots and design paper.

7500 2018-12-12 07:10:38 @DragonCoin surely this is another of many #cryptocurrencies that’s doomed to failure? Been out months and months on @CoinMarketCap and still not updated market cap and circulating supply. How is this normal? I would love an explanation from the team? Oh and it was over $3 ico!
7501 2018-12-12 07:10:33 Also the way market cap is calculated it is very unlikely a crypto can go 0, but Volume on the other hand can. If BTC volume where to go to zero the whole crypto industry would probably be already dead.

7558 2018-12-12 07:00:58 I hope that we will go back up, but.... this time is completely a different story. First of all because in 2013, nobody knew about crypto, in 2017 a lot of people invested and the majority of them lost a lot of money, and those are the one that pushed the price up. Not again..

7625 2018-12-12 06:50:48 possibly but i pretend he is a real nice guy with a horse
7626 2018-12-12 06:50:31 Don't forget he blocks people when they just ask him if it's true or not. He's a shady fuck.
7627 2018-12-12 06:50:22 Funny thing on Arbitrade website Len is a young guy, but in fact, in the movie looks like he was over 80 years old. Do you really believe that a guy of this age can build an innovative crypto business? I think that someone is screwing in all these old men.
7628 2018-12-12 06:50:19 Chart shows Gold is where Bitcoin was late 2015.. it has been accumulating and we need to check for the Golden Cross @gordon_crypto. Once it breaks up from 1400 it should enter a healthy bullish trend like Bitcoin 2016.
7629 2018-12-12 06:50:17 Oh my gosh!! ... he's going to come out the hero! Brilliant play... LOL. Thanks for sharing 
7630 2018-12-12 06:50:11 I don't think Moas daily DIG "at 0.40$" shilling helped. The intensity of his marketing/shilling campaign was second to none. This is the result of somebody unrelated to crypto-assets getting into the game and executing hard marketing. Different world.

- it's via @givecrypto, which wouldn't necessarily have Coinbase's t-address limitation
- they're confident the crypto is locally spendable

7650 2018-12-12 06:46:52 Awesome answer!Thanks. I'm going to do some work on understanding market maker/taker and how it functions. it seems this is key to understanding the underlying xrp mark. infrastructure. Will this dynamic also apply to dApps & apps, Kava/Cosmos, etc.?Appreciate your feedback 
7651 2018-12-12 06:46:12 Oh no you really got me there. 
7652 2018-12-12 06:46:10 The truth on this matter is simple;
Kolin is a thief, a pathological liar, & runs a paid group designed to shill coins he's invested in to his own followers, so he can then sell out from under them to grab profits at his followers' loss. 
He is the worst thing for crypto. #scam
7653 2018-12-12 06:45:58 Rekt!
7654 2018-12-12 06:45:58 oh wow, not a fan of his i see
7655 2018-12-12 06:45:58 そいつはtetherUSDだな。アメリカドルと一対一で交換するIOUトークンだ。実態のあるドル紙幣は仮想空間では使えないから、こうやって交換所に預けてトークンを受け取ってやり取りをするんだ。日本にもかつてJPYを交換するジャパンリップルトレードって所があったんだが、懐かしいな…

7658 2018-12-12 06:45:46 Having food reserves is always a good idea. I will remain optimistic unless the planet is ruined or my health is (whatever comes first). My view is that we humans are extremely resilient and if we got through WW2 then that accounts for something.
7659 2018-12-12 06:45:41 Rember friends if you are running any crypto software and you did not build it from source you cannot really trust it.

7661 2018-12-12 06:45:38 I'm developing a theory (tm) that newest crypto personalities behave in most arrogant manner. Come on, guys. You are not Cobain or Loom yet. And probably never will be.
I'm a bit tired of this attitude. Going to unfollow lots of people today.
7662 2018-12-12 06:45:26 Which one?

7703 2018-12-12 06:41:47 Governments struggle to increase voting rates, why crypto projects expect people to care about voting for your community affairs just to get small amount of imaginary money that hopefully will have value one day?
7704 2018-12-12 06:41:35 Coinbase why can't I buy the second largest crypto XRP on your platform but you seem to support some random tokens? Can you put the politics behind and offer your clients the choice please.
7705 2018-12-12 06:41:28 I'll use whatever works best.

Tell your boy Satoshi to get to work, bitcoin is the worst I've ever used out of all crypto.

7713 2018-12-12 06:40:40 Crypto will win as soon as developers manage to make their currencies real usecases. Most are still just an idea of what may perhaps be developed and adopted by people.
7714 2018-12-12 06:40:38 My point is that your point is a moot point. And if you can’t identify a crypto project that doesn’t currently have a “materially important” use case you should try doing a bit more research.
7715 2018-12-12 06:40:14 Then do your best to stop holding peoples crypto hostage.

The past as a map for the future may not hold

The power dynamics of the future may be radically different. They already are : encryption and crypto

7805 2018-12-12 06:25:16 While I definitely don't think distributed receipts will be the killer app of crypto or smart contracts, the advantage here would be customer access. I could look up my receipt using info like my rewards #, without having access to Wal-Mart's full database.

7809 2018-12-12 06:24:09 I disagree, but I wish you the best.
80% is more than enough for your favourite, with 20% as insurance against being wrong.  If you allocate 20% to the top5 (mc wt'ed), and rebalance every few mths... you're certain to ride up with whichever crypto eventually wins including bch.

7814 2018-12-12 06:23:12 Yes, same for all cryptos. @etoro is a trading platform. We're adding the feature of withdrawing crypto to a separate wallet due to popular demand from our clients. 

It's an additional service and a complex one given the global regulatory landscape in crypto at the moment.

7880 2018-12-12 06:08:00 Anybody who feels like investing in #Crypto please send me the money instead. In a year I’ll give you back 20% of it, and you’ll still be way ahead of where you would’ve been. You can thank me later. @MarkHubbard33
7881 2018-12-12 06:07:41 Like crypto, we might see another bull run to throw off everyone because that's how screwed up the system is. Following that will be a disastrous fall.
7882 2018-12-12 06:07:18 Hi 8ball!!!! how are you?

7885 2018-12-12 06:07:13 Muchos dicen que el #petro es la primera criptomoneda de Venezuela, pero pocos saben que no es así. Uso @ArepaCoinVe  para muchas compras, y tengo algo de ahorro en ella, otra que uso muy a menudo gracias a su fee súper bajo es @Bitcore_BTX  , ya muchos establecimiento lo usan.
7886 2018-12-12 06:07:11 #Litecoin has faster and cheaper transactions
1. "light" version of Bitcoin
2. minable Scrypt (PoW) 
3. block time target of 2.5 mins
4. 4x bitcoin supply 
5. On every exchange 
6. Faster to adapt

technology + lively community still put it at the forefront of crypto markets #ltc

7917 2018-12-12 05:59:44 A *very* thoughtful comment made that I fully agree with "It's been a rough 12 months for everyone. People should be banding together in crypto, not fighting one another w/ tribalism." - @CryptoParent - Let's all dial back our emotions and find our way through the dark together.
7918 2018-12-12 05:59:08 The @Uptherium is certainly a fascinating ICO as if it wants to build a world of crypto-currencies public and cheap for all people. If they manage to attract powerful developers of mobile applications and games, so success is sure to come.
7919 2018-12-12 05:58:58 Is this medical advice?
7920 2018-12-12 05:58:48 Just getting into crypto and i was able to set it up @xrptipbot and deposit 5 xrp. But how do you receive or send the xrp on Twitter that is the confusing part for me can u explain.. ty in advance.

7930 2018-12-12 05:57:54 It won’t be end user’s decision to use XRP for settlement at any phase, payment processor decides that.
Marketmaker buys your fiat from them and forwards XRP to receiver’s end. You don’t buy XRP, you sell fiat and buy receiver’s fiat. Faster and cheaper and benefits all parties

7939 2018-12-12 05:56:57 The biggest mistake people are making in regards to crypto is believing that its going to behave the same way in the future as it did in the past.
7940 2018-12-12 05:56:46 Taxes or manipulating interest rates wont help the economy now. 

Banks are limited to printing money only now to solve their problems they've caused.

Therefore there will come an inflationary crisis leaving btc, precious metals, land and real estate as safe havens.
7941 2018-12-12 05:56:42 In the crypto game @kittiefightHQ you can Buy more attractive crypto fluffy kittens with the money you earned.
7942 2018-12-12 05:56:42 Yes, referring to some of those stories about the Chinese mining farms a few weeks back. Tough time for crypto miners right now.

7950 2018-12-12 05:55:30 This was expected since it's still an emerging technology. The bubble has taught us a lot about crypto so now it can be developed more realistically.

7956 2018-12-12 05:53:41 This is how most of lay people think about good ol stock market too. They only see big moves and try to get in/out AFTER. Rookie mistake #1. Get a good #finance #investing #education #book. Same things as for stock market applies to #crypto in this perspective.

7958 2018-12-12 05:53:08 Yes, we are all happy to be one big crypto family with hopefully many successful projects that will survive and shape the future (although your conclusion about btc —> XRP are wrong; research David Schwartz - Patents 1988 and Ripple 2004). Have a great day!

7965 2018-12-12 05:52:10 From what I've seen in the last two years, many people don't know the difference between custodial and non custodial wallets. When I worked OTC the majority didn't realize Coinbase was essentially a crypto bank.

Mostly looking at the token economic value and intrinsic value of the crypto asset. I look a lot at Github events and separation of tasks etc and also model out the economic value connected to the crypto assets.

8025 2018-12-12 05:42:33 @mappopk_crypto great marketing manager
8026 2018-12-12 05:42:29 I'm sorry bro but if you really think this then you have 0 idea about what this is all about.
8027 2018-12-12 05:42:27 @arunjaitley dear sir why ur government has still not legalize cryptocurrency i invested 9.5 lakh mudra loan from bank and only because of u its delaying so plz legalize it now its inida where nirav modi vijay malya took money but u are disturbing lakhs of youth by ban crypto
8028 2018-12-12 05:42:26 Awesome
8029 2018-12-12 05:42:09 Buy and hold strategies don't work in a bear market, unless you want to feel a lot of pain for months and years ahead.  I'm a veteran at it:  re: crypto.  Learned the hard way.  It's not fun.  As they say in #gameofthrones:  winter is coming. #traditionalmarkets
8030 2018-12-12 05:42:08 Nice
8031 2018-12-12 05:41:59 You first
8032 2018-12-12 05:41:58 I believe the blockchain will win eventually but not the crypto currency as a speculative asset class
8033 2018-12-12 05:41:52 Anyways, I hope we don't see such a ruling against XRP. It would hurt masses of retail investors globally and surely have ripple effects on the crypto community (pun intended). This is the only reason @coinbase hasn't listed. Believe me, they want to list XRP and collect fees.

8042 2018-12-12 05:40:17 Simple terms like this are obvious when you understand but to someone new it sounds dodgy. So many things like this hold crypto back from the masses
8043 2018-12-12 05:40:09 Sometimes I got sad how people leave crypto today.
No intention to learn, no intention to improve their trading strategy.
Just wanted to get rich quick and leave otherwise.
They asked me it's still long way before golden cross why invest now?

Clearly though, this is a startup and they don't always succeed.
8055 2018-12-12 05:37:47 Perhaps, but the core of what I am saying is still the same, a quick and decisive response is more likely to mitigate casualties than everyone running away screaming
8056 2018-12-12 05:37:46 Dead
8057 2018-12-12 05:37:38 I know. 
I get it.
I've done youtube vids on why people hate XRP.
and it's mostly because it's a bank coin and helps banks evolve and grow, rather than the original intent of crypto to get away from all that.
Now we're giving them the tools to expand.

What changed??
8071 2018-12-12 05:34:16 Would you like to learn how to trade in crypto as well as gain experience without losing your money? Would you prefer a meticulously prepared assistant serve you while you invest? @UpTherium platform is what you need if your answers are yes for those questions.
8072 2018-12-12 05:34:00 The problem is, once you force messaging app “X” to break their crypto for one conversation, you’ve broken it for all. As some major compromises have shown this year, the one thing you can bet on is that someone else will discover your back door.

In fact @scb_thailand confirmed they are using digital assets a while ago and just recently hinted that it’s #XRP. 

My point was the haters always call XRP a bank coin even though tons of non-banks are using or piloting it

8236 2018-12-12 05:09:00 Platform scale drivers: minimal marginal costs of production and distribution, network effects powered by positive feedback, behavior design and community culture (crypto changes this fundamentally), learning filters paired with rewards, baked in virality.
8237 2018-12-12 05:08:56 I can explain many different ones but you can easily find that out on Google and I bet that for everyone problem I explain you will argue that crypto does not really solve it so its a useless discussion. You can NOT believe in crypto but don't claim your view is only correct one

8242 2018-12-12 05:08:23 As a skilled practitioner in crypto for quite some time, I can fairly say that this ICO-project is so advanced. This is, finally, what the market has been looking for. #ICO @TokenEUREKA @tokeneureka

Silly wanker.
8265 2018-12-12 05:04:29 Exactly. I didn't say that it is good, just that it is the reason of why people invested in crypto instead of stocks and alike. I have been saying that for a while: one cannot just buy bitcoin and hope to get retired, one must put efforts/time/energy to provide value to get some.

8370 2018-12-12 04:50:41 yes
8371 2018-12-12 04:50:34 Averaging down is an insanely wrong strategy. On a bear market you *always* sell the rips and *never* buy the dips. You average *up* when the tide turns, buying the dips. The result is almost the same, the risk is infinitely lower.
8372 2018-12-12 04:50:26 Reeeeee
8373 2018-12-12 04:50:18 I do, I liked most your topless and booty shaking vids! Don’t feel shitty about nobodies!
8374 2018-12-12 04:50:06 @Crypto___Oracle Does your gut ever get somewhat concerned about the incredible lack of negatives surrounding LINK & its future? In crypto, there is rarely a bet as sure as this one. Tho I try to find issues with it, I can't!

8387 2018-12-12 04:49:13 Right!! It’s best in my opinion to get behind a company that has this type of world vision in regards to changing the monetary system of payments with the implementation of a crypto currency that’s backed by real physical gold to accomplish this. Otherwise people will lose out.

8416 2018-12-12 04:46:57 No bulls ready. Markets are crashing worldwide and crypto is not a safe heaven, buy gold instead.
8417 2018-12-12 04:46:52 Investing in an asset to drag one out of poverty and working for somebody is as wrong as it gets. That's how one goes too big and losses everything. Most people lost money with crypto. Thinking like that must have helped.
8418 2018-12-12 04:46:35 Haha, I will!:) I rarely check those after having received several death threats.

8431 2018-12-12 04:45:36 Why would anyone take the bet?(either side). 10 years is a long time to commit to not changing your mind. Remember internet 1.0? Mostly it wasn’t the first in any category that won even if it seems that way now.  So even if you believe in crypto, Bitcoin probably ain’t the shit.

8441 2018-12-12 04:44:36 Crypto has looked like a dream for many all year. Just a few months ago talking heads were still talking about 50K by year end.

8471 2018-12-12 04:39:45 Bakkt delay is a quite possible scenario, taking into consideration it is still not approved by CFTC. If $BTC price slumps so sharp on negative ETF & Bakkt news and further growth of panic sentiments, we will see even lower price levels than 1.5k.
8472 2018-12-12 04:39:41 One of your favorite crypto moments is when @VitalikButerin was 5 meters away from the aging dictator of the world's 13th largest economy?

8655 2018-12-12 04:11:45 Tokens don’t represent equity, but nothing represents equity in decentralized projects. Instead devs and users sink or swim based on the price of token. It’s really not so different. Not the same, but it’s the crypto equivalent of equity, sort of, ish.

8732 2018-12-12 03:56:33 @noblebitcoin Hi! What fees do you charge for your crypto IRAs? They do not seem to be listed on your website.
8733 2018-12-12 03:56:25 Ever had a bubble bath? Always more than one bubble to pop.
8734 2018-12-12 03:56:09 I have an old TD account that’s been inactive for years. I’d reopen it immediately if you offered #XRP sales WITH WITHDRAWLS!!!

The ability to withdraw the #crypto is a must. If we can’t withdrawal the crypto to our own wallet that’s a deal breaker for most crypto lovers.
8735 2018-12-12 03:56:00 これは笑ってしまいましたw
8736 2018-12-12 03:55:48 I’m not a fan of TenX and don’t see any future in crypto-cards, but I think you are wrong here.
What is the difference if you change you’re crypto manually before buying something or if TenX is doing it right before the purchase? 
In both cases you pay with Fiat.
8737 2018-12-12 03:55:40 Dear @arunjaitley

If India does not push for positive crypto regulations then it will lead to black money & brain drain.

Indian investors want to openly & freely trade in crypto.

Indian techies want to openly & freely build for crypto.

Please listen to the voice of youth

8740 2018-12-12 03:55:14 Trade crypto to acquire more Bitcoin. Trade Bitcoin to acquire more fiat. ez game ez life.

If you must, buy Bitcoin. Crypto is useless.
8741 2018-12-12 03:54:38 I agree. I think the US government *should* feel pressure to resolve regulatory uncertainty & support innovation in the crypto industry, but I don't think it's there yet. If anything, I see legacy incumbents pressuring the SEC to move slowly, which is what they're doing.

8777 2018-12-12 03:47:53 If people keep saying something can be fixed using conventional means, just tweak this tweak that and they have tried that over and over with no success. Then you probably can't fix it using conventional means and you need something revolutionary to fix it. #Crypto

8800 2018-12-12 03:43:10 2. Because you’re a centralised intermediary who holds users crypto  - you need an escrow license. Got it? Where are you located?

The future tense clearly isn’t your strong point. When the word “will” is used in this context it indicates that something is going to happen in the future. Nobody is talking about what crypto is doing “right now” is that tweet.

8876 2018-12-12 03:30:49 $LTC volume spike. 971 coin print at $23.39.  $LTCUSD #LTCUSD #LTC #Litecoin #coinbase #gdax
8877 2018-12-12 03:30:46 Yes it’s taxable! And no wash sale rules for crypto :)

Financial institutions also look for #arbitrage. In simpler words, you can say it's a risk free (very minimal) technique, where one makes money by buying and selling #Assets on two different exchanges/markets

8879 2018-12-12 03:30:41 I would think the companies that are enclined to abuse GDPR would also be enclined to support crypto-backdoors...

8881 2018-12-12 03:30:00 Did you just do TA on Barad-Dur, the Dark Tower? The Eye of Sauron revealed over the bear market wastelands of crypto Mordor.
8882 2018-12-12 03:29:56 Did you read the news on the new 7nm AMDs next year? 12-16 cores at $500, vega performance for $250. If there was ever an opportunity for a miner like yourself, that would be it.
8883 2018-12-12 03:29:56 If money is a good application of crypto, then progrqmmable financial contracts using that money are also good applications of crypto.

I don't get the misalignment

8887 2018-12-12 03:29:03 In crypto world, it does not really matter if you speak English, Chinese, Cantonese, Korean, Japanese, Russian, Turkish or any other language. Money is a language. It is a way of communicating and transmitting our expectations and desires of value.

8891 2018-12-12 03:28:12 Said not using xrp, but if xcurrent can multihop & seamlessly integrate xrapid- I'm still not entirely sure at what "point" in this cross border process, do clients (i.e. end user via App and/or banks) decide "ok, lets choose xrp for this settlement" or not??
8892 2018-12-12 03:28:11 10yr sharpe of the best CTAs is sub 1 now.
8893 2018-12-12 03:28:01 so we see more hints at genuine use cases and more evidence of blockchain startups making gains in the enterprise sector and mainstream markets. Still early days, yes.
8894 2018-12-12 03:27:51 Our goal at @travalacom is to reach that very audience of non crypto users your mentioning. Mass adoption of blockchain is key for growth & sustainability. But also building products that don’t need the users to understand crypto are very important.
8895 2018-12-12 03:27:45 Regardless of those costs, any good business should be solvent enough to carry its operational budget for several years in case of setbacks. Like, customers pull out and days later he's ready to give it all up? Was he living paycheck to paycheck or what?

8897 2018-12-12 03:27:10 The project is a unique company which has no equal on the market. The company is striking in its scale and ambition. Very easy interface to use. Suggest to participate and cooperate with this company.  #Gigzi #crypto #blockchain #GZB #preciousmetal #stablecoin #ethereum

8910 2018-12-12 03:25:37 Most people lost money in crypto as they got in late, and then averaged down. Crypto has been a simple redistribution of wealth from the many to the few.

8915 2018-12-12 03:25:19 I believe that was post China fud. Big sell off, perfect for big players as they bought that dip and sent it straight to $19k+ over the next few months
8916 2018-12-12 03:25:00 Your point is valid.The technology is blockchain and not crypto.Blockchain will be widely accepted over time because it solves a need but I can't say the same for crypto

8923 2018-12-12 03:24:13 The companies that decided to withdraw from operating in Europe because of GDPR.  Are they going to pull out of Australia too over this crypto bafoonary?
8924 2018-12-12 03:24:12 Thanks bro. Well I’m still here. Hopefully it pays off. Still dumping fresh fiat into crypto when I can.
8925 2018-12-12 03:24:10 It’s also very very hard to do. Basic cross over trend following is ancient these days. 

Way better to outsource trend following to a professional manager. DYI is dangerous

8928 2018-12-12 03:23:56 Solving a problem with the best possible user experience wins over all.  If crypto + blockchain are part of that solution then great, but they should be nearly seamless and certainly effortless to the user.  
8929 2018-12-12 03:23:53 I remember this time last year thinking about goals for 2018. The market was exploding and I set a goal of making enough crypto to buy a car.

This is when I should have known we wouldn’t go up forever. Very valuable lesson about taking profits and not being stupid

8934 2018-12-12 03:23:00 BTC drives crypto a lot was doing well then.  People were asking about ripple and other alts.  It was a popular time for crypto in general.  Yes it however was btc at 20k. People back away when you call them "nocoiners"

8938 2018-12-12 03:22:07 XRP, like all cryptos, is manipulated by the shady BTC whales who pump and dump the entire market. Btc is the biggest pump and dump scam as the entire crypto market follows it.
8939 2018-12-12 03:22:03 I believe that most of your followers are not necessarily in there for crypto. But hey, that's what I believe, anything is possible.
8940 2018-12-12 03:21:55 Trend followers are near negative this decade. Crypto is up like a million %. 

I actually have managed tactical multi asset class portfolios that rotated asset classes via trend following. So I believe in it. 

It just has its pros and cons

8943 2018-12-12 03:21:12 It's a security platform on the Stellar Network

It focuses on real estate primarily 

I like it, I haven't invested because it's still a crypto asset and like everything else tied to Bitcoin
8944 2018-12-12 03:21:00 100% Agree. I think suggesting to people to speculate better as a solution to crypto bear markets is indeed a trojan horse intended to get them to lose more money (mostly in fees and to the liquidation fund).
8945 2018-12-12 03:20:43 No I seem to be boring too! I only have one account
8946 2018-12-12 03:20:38 TA won't save you anymore. Aside from volume and RSI, there are plays in motion that the TA meme won't be able to see. It goes so far beyond all that basic stuff you have no idea, lol. And there are big ops making moves far beyond what the  can reach.  $btc #crypto

8956 2018-12-12 03:19:47 My wildest thing was reading about the country of Venezuela planning to launch their own cryptocurrency. That was one of the very few enlightenment moments I've experienced in Crypto, since it fully-opened my horizon to future possibilities / adoption of cryptocurrencies.

8962 2018-12-12 03:18:58 And in what way does cryptoizing it lift those barriers to existence/adoption? (Obv I don’t think the crypto part moves the needle on making “Internet-based prediction market” viable.)
8963 2018-12-12 03:18:45 Shit, I don't talk about crypto to anyone irl. Don't see the point. This is my personal wormhole. I know how much work goes into attempting to gain an edge in an almost entirely speculative space. Average people would be mortified.
8964 2018-12-12 03:18:42 #BTC Went from .05 USD to 3,400 USD. Best preforming asset in over a decade. I'm confused as to why you think you have a point. You are only showing your lack of knowledge of the crypto space. Even those that bought at 20k will be redeemed #stackandhodl

8996 2018-12-12 03:15:35 What do I do if I already follow her?
8997 2018-12-12 03:14:47 I somewhat disagree with the pressure issue. The more time passes, the further the US could be behind more crypto-friendly regulatory regimes outside of the US, thereby stifling innovation at home and leading these companies to go abroad.

Spot on analogy, holy shit. Great thread, definitely makes me rethink my approach to investing in crypto.
9009 2018-12-12 03:11:36 Yeah I think we're in agreement there that most people should quit crypto and find more interesting/less expensive hobbies. Fortunately they've already done so now past few months.

9093 2018-12-12 02:56:42 Ah, I see you're new to crypto.
Doing one's own research is critical to understand how the space works.   That us, unless you are content with repeating false narratives perpetrated by those with ulterior motives.  There is a reason the block reward halves. 
9094 2018-12-12 02:56:37 Agree - my 9 card rigs cost 5k AUD - 4.3k USD each (1070 FEs ).   10k a rig is just throwing money down the drain

9097 2018-12-12 02:55:58 Crypto’s been around for over 10 years without a substantial uptake. At what point do we ask if it’s simple another BetaMax video. Technically better. Huge potential. Simply not enough traction.

9100 2018-12-12 02:55:43 The thing also is that crypto looks like a dream for many out there. And investing in money market or SPX would, probably (yet not necessarily) hedge your saving against the inflation and even provide some dividends. But it will not drag you out of poverty and the job you hate...

9137 2018-12-12 02:47:12 What you said is very well put. Applies to stocks not crypto, a massively volatile/speculative asset class that has had three 80-99% crashes in 7 years. Average Joe should actually have stayed out of crypto. Yes many made fortunes. Many more list their shirts.

9141 2018-12-12 02:46:24 This can’t happen as the federal government could never afford the interest on its debts. That simple, case closed.
9142 2018-12-12 02:46:13 Another example of US's worldwide jurisdiction. Meng is not a US citizen, was not in US territory. She was in Canada for a 12 hour layover. That's enough for the Canadian authorities to arrest her on behalf of the US. Many in crypto think they aren't under US laws. Think again.
9143 2018-12-12 02:46:00 まずこの国の基軸通貨、ビットコインだな。仮想通貨という概念を最初に提示した始祖の通貨だ。基本的にこのお金を使って他の通貨と交換することになるから、これからずっとお世話になるぞ。

9156 2018-12-12 02:44:03 I think you’re wrong. Uber “won” because they’ve organized good lobbying efforts, raising and donating money and playing the game by the book. I don’t see a well organized crypto lobbying yet. Maybe the fintech sector is doing it right, but I wouldn’t say the same for crypto.
9157 2018-12-12 02:43:52 By that time no crypto as a currency. Best thing is to utilize the technology. Not the shitty cryptos
9158 2018-12-12 02:43:34 I like the layout and design definitely WORTHY of the #ROG BADGE!  Looks like I’m building a new rig to trade my #TRON and #GEMS crypto and of course some VR and Gaming!
9159 2018-12-12 02:43:02 Can you say "externalized costs"? Big tech companies (and big companies in general) won't lose money. Individuals will get additional risk burdens. Think identify theft is a pain for a person now? Just wait...

9162 2018-12-12 02:42:33 4/4 But if it will be profitable in future – again, for a non-professional – it is more reasonable to buy more with every new low (especially if some was bought at the top already) than to wait until "the trend reversal", partially because Joe will not know, when it happens.
9163 2018-12-12 02:42:17 3/4 So, when we are talking about the investment in something, we should define whether this investment worth anything. Like, if the asset is a crap and will go to zero, it does not matter, will you use dollar-cost average or you would wait for the rise – eventually you get rekt.

9166 2018-12-12 02:41:52 2/4 All Joe can do is to give his money to a mutual fund or something hoping that they will not lose it. Which is really a good deal only, when global market are up, but again our friend Joe doesn't know, when they are at the middle of the way up just before the grand drop.

Good thing is at this point it already made enough money to rework it by itself. This is mainly the reason we are going to ath at some point. 
Money made here was huge, and will for sure return to make more again.

9193 2018-12-12 02:36:44 Cheers bro, feel free to ask me if u wanna know anything about crypto mate
9194 2018-12-12 02:36:37 As a real professional in crypto for some period of time, I can sincerely say that this ICO-project is so next-generation. This is, definitely, what the market has been looking for. #bitvalve @bitvalve
9195 2018-12-12 02:36:10 Yeah this is the most dangerous part, during QT, parter dealers and the central banks generally store money as rates rise, better rate of return in cash than in investments, economy will stop dead in its tracks.

We will always denounce this type of behavior.

Taking advantage of people, like those truly trying to help Venezuelans while you waste their time.

Your a time waster.
9234 2018-12-12 02:29:22 I think you guys are both right. By definition not everyone can buy the "bottom." Most people would be better off DCA on something they are willing to invest in long-term than trying to time the markets. Conversely, those who can do analysis probably should to get the best entry.

9240 2018-12-12 02:28:05 Your real pov begins with the "but". The first part is a useless qualification on your behalf. When will you admit to being a crypto-fascist? White Nationalists seem to think you are, which is why they retweet you on the regular.
9241 2018-12-12 02:27:57 xrp is THE standard
9242 2018-12-12 02:27:38 So basically they are taking back all the free money?
9243 2018-12-12 02:27:35 I can educate myself about Blockchain, crypto more instead of focusing only on price or Lambo.
9244 2018-12-12 02:27:16 Avoiding the real issue.

You deceive. Your an attention seeker. Your bad for crypto.

Crypto people don't promise 500,000 currency for starving Venezuelan when it's worth 0$.

9255 2018-12-12 02:24:52 That’s not what I said or am saying. Crypto is still pretty new in the grand scheme of things. it would be a mistake to write it off due to a pop of an extreme hype cycle.
9256 2018-12-12 02:24:39 I'm very satisfied with the quality of this product. I give credence to this ICO-project and I will advise it to everyone who is engaged into crypto. Trust me, this product in actually that good! @ImpressoLabs

9270 2018-12-12 02:22:26 Is it because if to much recruiting or crypto-recruiting?
9271 2018-12-12 02:22:14 Nothing always works.

Yes you can time the market.

Trend following strategies do just that.

Many ways to time the market.

People devote entire careers to study monetary policy and politics (and now crypto) to time the market.
9272 2018-12-12 02:22:14 They wont adobt crypto soon.. they are trying to get rid of dependency on dollar, buying crazy amounts of gold quietly to be ready.. if they will adobt cross border payments, they wont be using bitcoin
9273 2018-12-12 02:21:18 I doubt her family were Crypto Jews. I would guess Conversos, (Spanish: “converted”), of the Spanish Jews who adopted the Christian religion after a severe persecution in the late 14th & early 15th centuries & the expulsion of religious Jews from Spain in the 1490s
9274 2018-12-12 02:21:13 Central Banks.... the biggest manipulators and money launderers of all want to regulate crypto to prevent money laundering... no thanks!
9275 2018-12-12 02:20:55 He cares because @MarkYusko and @APompliano are legit spokespeople for the crypto community in my opinion.

9287 2018-12-12 02:19:33 All through time, people have basically acted and reacted the same way in the market as a result of: greed, fear, ignorance, and hope. That is why the numerical formations and patterns recur on a constant basis.

9288 2018-12-12 02:19:32 Quote of the Day: 
“In 2018 everyone wanted to be in crypto. In 2019, we will find out who really wants to be in crypto.”

—Cameron Winklevoss on Twitter. Gemini, the popular exchange he owns with his brother, Tyler, just launched a mobile trading app.
9289 2018-12-12 02:19:20 2008 Maddoff, 2018 Crypto.
9290 2018-12-12 02:19:14 Because "Expenses" is type of natural disaster. Suddenly stricken one day with Fractional yachtshare, crypto portfolio & private school fees while quietly fulminating against the Bad Life Choices of the dying.
9291 2018-12-12 02:19:08 UX is why they won. UX is what crypto needs more of to win.

9313 2018-12-12 02:16:09 Not good news for risk-on markets in general. If Fed continues course could very well dry up buy bitcoin buy pressure even further. First time bitcoin will exist through a risk-off environment, will be interesting to see what happens.
9314 2018-12-12 02:16:09 When I heard that Pewdiepie promoted a nazi video, i figured it was just alt light crypto BS about IQ or something and wasn't gonna harp on it since I've been knowing that peds is trash...
9315 2018-12-12 02:16:01 factomか…そいつにはあまり良い思い出がないな…ICOに参加していたんだが、いざ使えるようになったって段階でまさかのCUI操作で、不安が市場に響いて一時価値が購入価格を割ってな。あれはすごい体験だった…今は中国政府との謎の癒着が垣間見れるから、あんまり手を付けるんじゃないぞ。

9352 2018-12-12 02:10:28 If you really want to build this, throw a big some of money to get your coin in the market, build a website where people can use other crypto coin to trade off with other crypto coin like bitcoins for an example. but for community wise i'm worried if it is mixed with makers.
9353 2018-12-12 02:10:25 If you could go back in time to the day you first bought crypto, what would you tell yourself?

9433 2018-12-12 01:59:35 That's always the thing. The greed makes people hold. Even a loss.
Cut them quick,  especially if it drops by a third rapidly. Gtfo. Buy back in if needed when it looks like a good price

9435 2018-12-12 01:59:31 Tron and Digibyte are at great prices to buy at now and hold long term.
9436 2018-12-12 01:59:02 Claiming that crypto is nothing more than money is like claiming back in 2007 that the iPhone would be nothing more than a thing to make phone calls with.

Cryptonetworks unlock a new paradigm for computation. Money just happens to be their most obvious application.

9440 2018-12-12 01:58:32 The certainty in your post goes against the golden rule of trading “there are no certainties” just probability. Explain your probability
9441 2018-12-12 01:58:29 It's most likely that the people who are on the Bitcoin podcasts are losing money as well so it's basically the blind leading the blind, like most Crypto Twitter accounts and Youtube channels.
9442 2018-12-12 01:58:20 Nessuna crypto con questa volatilità, sarà mai usata come mezzo di pagamento. Chi le possiede, le tiene, aspettando che aumentino di valore: sono considerate investimenti. Solo le stable Coin sono utili come mezzo di pagamento. Se lavorate alla mass adoption, sbagliate strada.
9443 2018-12-12 01:58:20 If you don’t believe in the monetary system then ok. However when that doomsday scenario comes around I don’t think Bitcoin will help. Food may be the new currency. Again blockchain and Hashgraph as a technology is great I just question us putting a monetary value on it.

9474 2018-12-12 01:53:52 I understand crypto but is only a concept. It doesn’t make good business sense. Actually blockchain isn’t even all that efficient due to long settlement times. Hashgraph would be better IMO. My point is like metals it is not productive. At least with gold I can widely transact.

9494 2018-12-12 01:49:51 It's always a big moment when projects pass 1 million USD in value but when a company like bitmax starts passing 30 million a day in transactions its a BIG day, so big that they also get to be listed on CMC! $BMAX #bmaxtoken #bitmax #exchange #Crypto #CryptoCurrency #Blockchain

2. Crypto may not go away, but neither has Scientology or chiropractors. Still basically a scam.
9557 2018-12-12 01:37:51 I would have been impressed had you accurately predicted short or long beforehand.   Otherwise you're just another FURU spewing useless hindsight knowledge trying to appear as if you know what you're doing

9561 2018-12-12 01:37:17 #Crypto is a scam
9562 2018-12-12 01:37:15 アルトコインの急騰直前のチャート見てるんだけど、無関心の極みってところに至ってさらに数ヶ月経ってから始まってるって感じ。

心配しなくても、いまは爆騰する条件ではないよって感じです(税金売りする人へ)
9563 2018-12-12 01:37:07 faster? no, its way slower

cheaper? a 3% merchant processing fee feels cheap compared to BTC volatility

more efficient? lol no

more secure? not really, but it's pseudonymous and uses the word "crypto" a lot!
9564 2018-12-12 01:37:05 A crypto project sharing revenue with token holders sounds more like a security/equity
9565 2018-12-12 01:37:01 Dirty Crypto Gangstas?
9566 2018-12-12 01:36:58 It's a really good question, that doesn't get answered thoughtfully often enough. So thank you for the opportunity.

9568 2018-12-12 01:36:35 Congrats to all the winners from the 1000 Cova award, with so much recent publicity for the project i get the feeling as the overall market returns to ATH this is one of those projects that might really move quickly upward.

9579 2018-12-12 01:33:48 One of the most important this is to remember that cryptos are the future and that the technology will  reflect the price over time bitcoin will rise again it's just a matter of time for a lot of reasons so be patient it will turn around hold strong keep your cool

9589 2018-12-12 01:32:23 Bitcoin is down over 80%. Saying that the bubble popped is not an opinion it is a fact. Even of it eventually inflates again.
9590 2018-12-12 01:32:20 It “was” a bubble and it “popped” I would take this a good sign it bottomed. Let’s go to moon again :)

9594 2018-12-12 01:31:56 I know that lol I’m saying a funny joke related to crypto !
9595 2018-12-12 01:31:51 It is only volatile because the market is so small compared to any fiat money.....
9596 2018-12-12 01:31:36 @EmperorLeong
9597 2018-12-12 01:31:29 It should be the *same* date!

Imagine! Everyone gets their BTC (and all other crypto) into their wallets AND banks suddenly close their doors (temporarily) due to a bank run. What a lesson for the general public!
9598 2018-12-12 01:31:13 Crypto is no joke
9599 2018-12-12 01:30:48 Agree with your sentiments. Trends you expect in GPU volumes/pricing going forward to go with your thesis that the death of crypto will crush GPUs would be helpful. And how much of a risk are the ongoing $AMD share gains in servers vs $INTC? I think $NVDA is the easier short

9606 2018-12-12 01:29:38 Pomp is always posting vague “crypto is changing the world” bullshit. There’s no (legal) use case for bitcoin ATM. Too inefficient for a currency and treating slots in a DB as stores-of-value is dumb for many more reasons.
9607 2018-12-12 01:29:31 awareness... perhaps some kind of initiative... partner with a project, some kind of donation/airdrop to start the process, get people to understand the concept. There are a lot of unbanked people in the developing world, but the tech is "leap-frogging". Smartphones r prevalent.

The only defense is education and vigilance: Almost all these impersonators want money for some "service" or to "give away" crypto

9615 2018-12-12 01:28:45 no person or group of people can prevent what wall street is doing to crypto now. u have no idea what you're talking about. you think idiots who just HODL and never sell are gonna prevent Goldman,Citi,Morgan Stanley,fidelity,Trueex,ICE, from setting up shop and doing their thing?
9616 2018-12-12 01:28:40 Crypto is something I have the juice to, and hundred per cent of ICO-projects I chose were outstanding lately. I choose and have faith in this project as well! #Mixin_Network $Xin @
9617 2018-12-12 01:28:34 And that'll be crypto's downfall.
9618 2018-12-12 01:28:32 Man like Peter Brandt, trust me he is usually wrong specially when it comes to Crypto.
9619 2018-12-12 01:27:51 I agree and leave my wallet at home, then you can't spend anything and you can buy more crypto when the bottoms in haha

Looking forward to #ABE2019 during #ATLBlockchainweek thanks to @Cryptolina!
9639 2018-12-12 01:24:34 Also, hi @APompliano! Been a while. I was a relatively early Uber user, and after a couple years it was always somewhat clear where the Uber vision was heading. Do you have a good starting point to help me better understand how crypto evolves to solve consumer needs?
9640 2018-12-12 01:24:28 Same thing I did last time: make a dank podcast, collect crypto, and use Q-Tips against doctors’ recommendations.

9643 2018-12-12 01:24:19 It's called cutting your losses.  Hodling is what noob traders do when they hit a loss... They chase it adding more money, making it easy for futures traders to buttfuck you one by one.

9654 2018-12-12 01:21:59 Then you do know how low it will go. Crypto is an undefined space and buying in is a risk. In crypto it's either going to moon or go to zero. When your known potential return is 10x it may be worth the wager

9691 2018-12-12 01:15:26 Where do you get those flawed statistics? totally wrong. Crypto is a scam oscillating by over 70% of its value within just as long as 6 months. In what country is crypto currency a leading medium of exchange? Shame on you

9703 2018-12-12 01:12:50 Crypto community is becoming totally demoralized.  There is not enough real utility and no new developments have made people excited about the future.  Crypto is not dead in my opinion but looks like it will be on life support for years to come!  Thoughts?
9704 2018-12-12 01:12:47 ahaha.  I joke that I have the most generic physical description in crypto.  About 6'0 scrawny white guy with glasses and facial scruff describes half of a typical US crypto conference.

9712 2018-12-12 01:10:57 So does that mean that someone who steals your private key now owns that 1/5000th of the New York real estate?  

No? It doesn't? You mean the crypto token is an entirely superfluous part of the transaction?

9741 2018-12-12 01:07:04 Every major bitcoin rally that was followed by the crash ended with a new ATH, while every new bottom was higher than preceded ATH. 
That is why BTC will unlikely drop below 1200$. No 1k, no 100$, nothing of such non-sense.

When you can pinpoint your object of interest, get instantaneous info on it, use crypto to act on it & have new communication protocols to tell your friends about it.

9761 2018-12-12 01:03:06 I am lucky that I have colleagues and one of my best friends that is into crypto, no one else I know is into it and those that do know about it only talk about the price of BTC tanking. CT does skew my perspective a little bit as I can sometimes get caught up in it.

9844 2018-12-12 00:51:34 1. Quality candidates are on the move right now. They are looking for home - moving on from that project that made the fatal mistake of not hedging their Crypto into Fiat currency and thus giving them a runway to complete their projects.
9845 2018-12-12 00:51:32 Are you testing out-of-sample data sets or just in-sample data????? I would never trust any data runs with just in-sample data.

9847 2018-12-12 00:51:00 So what is the point of #altseason again? 

Oh that's right, make as much money by doing the least amount of work possible. 

Learn to grind it out during the bear markets. I guarantee you this won't be the last one #crypto sees in the future.
9848 2018-12-12 00:50:57 ARE WE IN COUNSELING RN? I FEEL LIKE I AM IN COUNSELING RN!
9849 2018-12-12 00:50:49 I believe we have a recession that has been delayed combined with a corporate debt crisis along with the deglobalization of US dollar.
9850 2018-12-12 00:50:44 Beast is next level terrible at making calls. Literally makes no sense why anyone would try to call bottom right now unless he enjoys being a meme, which is possible I guess.
9851 2018-12-12 00:50:26 I’m just as critical as ever. Haha. I need to see passion and dedication. I love @StakeAndNodes jams and graveyard lists. This needs to be expanded to dox parties responsible where the coins teams have exit scammed them. A deathly winter but those that remain deserve attention.

9853 2018-12-12 00:50:14 Like, you could, but:
The market chooses an often higher price for you, than you could mine yourself.
You can't choose to immediately accumulate a different coin if you straight buy.
Mining capital is resaleable, often above cost (ask @CryptoJuggalo)
9854 2018-12-12 00:50:09 It could be argued that they care;-

Bitcoin creates sound "Money" and that doesn't exist anywhere else in the known Universe;

Other Crypto's are each an individual prediction market of possible utility that takes away value from sound "Money"

Maybe Preachers are the problem?
9855 2018-12-12 00:49:58 Your thesis is only true if bitcoin goes to zero. Which it may, but at that point it won’t matter if your DCAd, went all in at 20k, or bought at $10
9856 2018-12-12 00:49:52 Crypto will win for the same reason that Uber & Airbnb won.

Technology ultimately makes regulations adapt. Corruption crumble. Collusion vanish.

The people triumph over the establishment when technology empowers them.

Software engineering beats financial engineering all day.

9862 2018-12-12 00:48:41 I'm grateful for the opportunity to buy crypto at these prices...  no fear, only optimism.  Humanity needs this technology, if embraced BTC LTC can set us free from the existing fear and scarcity paradigm..

9875 2018-12-12 00:46:48 I expend time in going through ICO-projects, trying to learn about their ideas and their team. I think this ICO-project is troubleproof and can help many people to triumph. #ICO #Crypto @NHCToken

9891 2018-12-12 00:45:12 Oddly enough, the only reason I have a td bank account is because they never gave me an issue when buying crypto. Had it not been for that; would have dumped them. The phone at sucks and never clear my transactions correctly. Just saying!

9894 2018-12-12 00:44:39 Fx and crypto are not exclusive to each other, you can still trade both.
9895 2018-12-12 00:44:38 you probably dont want to know my answer to that question.

9902 2018-12-12 00:44:00 My friend who is an expert in crypto sent me the link to this ICO-project. I believe him, and I also think that this project is prominent! #robriesgallery @robriesgallery
9903 2018-12-12 00:43:58 He is done in the crypto industry, I just hope he can go back to stock picks/S&P, I never wish ill on anyone, but as far as crypto goes “his defense plea signed his own bill of indictment” I believe he has integrity and got mixed up bad, but there’s no coming back from this $dig
9904 2018-12-12 00:43:46  What if you could build charity right into a crypto digital product.  Like 15% of all your revenue go to help people.
9905 2018-12-12 00:43:35 I don’t get all the panic in the crypto community. This isn’t a crash, it’s the sale of the year. Time to stock up.

This is when the real money is made in crypto.
9906 2018-12-12 00:43:22 I guess you are new to crypto?

9908 2018-12-12 00:43:16 ETH running from $11 to $330 paid my undergrad loans off. What kind of laws stand in the way of state economies benefiting from crypto? What have other states done to be more crypto-friendly?
9909 2018-12-12 00:43:05 One way to describe using crypto and exchange of value. 

Let’s say you don’t have unlimited text. Why chat with text through your wireless provider when there is Facebook messenger ? Same exchange of info but mostly unlimited. 

Money is the same way. Use crypto instead of banks
9910 2018-12-12 00:43:01 I got a feeling your EOS bag is pretty hefty.
9911 2018-12-12 00:42:14 whats the goal? just general awareness? I was thinking of holding a community class. I feel like many people are aware of crypto, but the learning curve can be pretty steep at first. People arent confident enough to even attempt to enter the space.

9939 2018-12-12 00:37:01 Interesting... this is something I’d really like to dig into, but I’m not quite sure where/how to start. Probably need to start networking a little deeper into the space and find some people to team up with.
9940 2018-12-12 00:36:57 This is just going off the calculated usd value by tradingviews crypto screener... WTC at -91.3% 
9941 2018-12-12 00:36:37 Bull case for crypto may be if it gets backed by gvrnmnt. Hard for new currency to sustain itself otherwise. Similar to mining gold, but gold/ metals have some jewelry/industrial uses. They also have "perceived" psychological "worth" via established behavior. Very difficult.
9942 2018-12-12 00:36:18 Ronnie Moas is an irresponsible and reckless analyst. His shilling of DIG is nothing short of a disgrace. Now he’s playing the innocent hero?? The man has zero integrity!! Crypto will be much better off with people like this out of the industry.  $DIG
9943 2018-12-12 00:36:18 Existe sim. Tou num grupo em que ele lá está também. A lá uns parecidos com ele

9944 2018-12-12 00:35:59 it does look that way, yes. BUT i will not long this unless it breaks out bullishly and then re-tests AND btc is holding lows. the rest of crypto and BTC are in a bear market and they could prevent it from taking off.
9945 2018-12-12 00:35:58 @unicorn please excuse the drama.  I really do think this is an important topic though.  This is only going to get 10X worse I think when crypto flares back up again and tons of money get dropped into communities and sites.

9964 2018-12-12 00:30:57 It’s overkill but his thought process is sound. Crypto shouldn’t be 100% of your assets. It’s should on be a handful of % (with rebalances). So such a person should be locked and loaded right now
9965 2018-12-12 00:30:47 Though I don’t disagree it will be a few years until we cheer about new ATH. This opportunity to scoop up cheap btc shouldn’t be missed.
9966 2018-12-12 00:30:37 Right now I only have 20% of my money in crypto. If $btc drops and wicks out to 2000-1500 or further. I will 100% go all In

9971 2018-12-12 00:30:07 Not one aspect of this project makes any sense. 
Each new ICO is a barnacle in crypto. Don't shill nonsense dressed up as econ development. Additionally, the facts in that article about the MENA region are incorrect.

9975 2018-12-12 00:29:07 Even though the media and most of the public will portray crypto as dead and worthless, this is the time to scale into those long term positions and follow development closely.

9982 2018-12-12 00:27:47 ETC isn't a token my dude
Learn about Crypto first, then talk. Or just improve the structure of your sentences if you didn't mean to implie that ETC is a token.

9984 2018-12-12 00:27:37 What's your biggest bag?
9985 2018-12-12 00:27:17 Is Bitcoin the fastest crypto for transactions? Can it handle the most volume? The most decentralized? Can it handle contracts?
9986 2018-12-12 00:26:38 Worth every $XVG
9987 2018-12-12 00:26:23 なんて素敵な名前なんや！
9988 2018-12-12 00:26:17 You think Japanese people would actually demand a BOJ issued digital currency? It seems that lot of the current Japanese demand for crypto assets is to avoid being exposed to an unsustainable BOJ policy that has no clear exit plan.

9998 2018-12-12 00:24:30 Thanks for getting back to us Crypto.  We're really sorry to hear about your experience  and we certainly understand your point of view. This has already been addressed to the Store Management team so they can let the relevant charity organisation know. 1/2
9999 2018-12-12 00:24:28 Do you work in heaven?
10000 2018-12-12 00:24:28 About that, that'll be 200 $xvg please. Lol
10001 2018-12-12 00:24:26 With an electric fence! The ones they use for bulls. And if u go to pass out from pain with just give you the sniffing salt to bring u back. Good plan guys, high five.
10002 2018-12-12 00:23:58 Well there goes my ama.

Fuck

Wasted it
10003 2018-12-12 00:23:47 Huh? Wtf is a crypto information business??
10004 2018-12-12 00:23:44 I found true community members
10005 2018-12-12 00:23:42 Some day, I should release some crypto to USD war stories. Seen a lot of crazy sh*t behind exchanges and fintechs.
10006 2018-12-12 00:23:38 You rediversify your portfolio as you find better projects & as time progresses

There isn’t a scenario where holding that many coins makes sense

If your goal is to buy crypto once and forget about it then your best bet is to just own Bitcoin
10007 2018-12-12 00:23:34 Sick man, I was there. Came for the crypto, left bc of the butthole.
10008 2018-12-12 00:23:32 うちブラックやねん。
黒すぎて光沢を帯びている。笑
10009 2018-12-12 00:23:29 Powell definitely seems more responsible and than most previous fed chairs. However, this is probably not good for stocks and crypto over the next few years.
10010 2018-12-12 00:23:21 #Tron $TRX is actually speeding up adoption of #crypto.

I like what they are doing, funding projects, games and supporting creators and devs. 

Micro transactions, in-game interaction, mining, collecting items and much more.

User base keeps growing
