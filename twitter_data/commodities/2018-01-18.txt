58 2018-01-18 20:30:30 ... and it's true that such rules often reward procyclicality (which is much less likely to happen with SME loans, because you cannot trade them easily, unlike real estate, commodities, securities etc.).

60 2018-01-18 20:25:06 Yeah, reminds me of what Kara Walker is always saying about the double-bind of needing to instantiate and reify race before being able to talk about it, or Stuart Hall on constituting idea in pop culture (thus they become commodities)
61 2018-01-18 20:20:50 No lie... had a buddy from college that traded commodities.. Asked me what a soybean field was once.. (about 4 years after he started)
62 2018-01-18 20:18:23 There's a Shuja Haider thing I can't 100% remember about like... to what extent are we reduced to first appropriating our own identities as commodities?
63 2018-01-18 20:16:33 Sure, but I guess I think that the gatekeeping around queerness is a persistent recognition that these identities were already commodities. We're like forty years late on the commodification of queerness

71 2018-01-18 19:51:32 Slavery in Amerikkka has always sought ways 2 De-humanize its captives. As subjects/commodities under the 13th amendment of the u.s constitution, prisons entire mission is 2 dehumanize & exploit. In counter we initiated "millions for prisoners human rights"
72 2018-01-18 19:50:59 So more bulk exports (eg commodities) = less brand = no premium  = greater misery.
It’s that simple folks.
73 2018-01-18 19:43:43 Bitcoin could hit $100,000 in 2018, an analyst who correctly predicted the cryptocurrency's rally at the start of last year told CNBC. People all around the world are using Bitcoin to purchase real estate commercial and residential Commodities like rude

75 2018-01-18 19:37:28 Oga, this is serious.. Do u know by increasing wages it will be more critical if u can not put in place "Price control" Encourage growing of businesses by civil servants to have more income other than salary! But adding salary will add equal percentage in prices of commodities..

79 2018-01-18 19:27:09 .@MSGRIDIRON live cattle commodities are up .03 today up to $1.21.  Hog futures are inching higher today while live cattle auctions are holding steady for the most part with heifers trending upwards by $3-5 per lb.

81 2018-01-18 19:18:26 I'm curious, though. When it was the men being treated as commodities, it was misogyny. When it's the women being treated as commodities, it's misogyny.
Surely we should be fighting for equality of both of the sexes in this case?
82 2018-01-18 19:14:55 The problem is less families and family corporations controlling copyright and more copyright being tied to estates that have become "lost" or owned as bundled commodities by agencies that don't do anything with them.

88 2018-01-18 18:45:52 That is just an example bt if u want to start a business it will be difficult because of duty and we end up doing nothing because of profit less business. .....in other words without duty the majority of Zimbabwe will be able to buy and sell different commodities
89 2018-01-18 18:31:59 Currency does not have a use-value, only an exchange-value. That is sort of the foundation of capitalism: exchange-value gains importance over use-value, which at one time was all commodities had. I'm starting to suspect you don't know what you're talking about!

95 2018-01-18 17:56:25 Might be debatable because "is it currency or commodity" is the issue with bitcoin being treated inconsistently at this time, as far as I understand. Commodities have lots of value in niches. Isn't that the deal with municipal bonds or some shit. Or "local dollars" or barter.

110 2018-01-18 16:34:47 Sure. But crypto tends to be far more unstable, both good and bad. Plus it isnt as diversity proof as stocks/commodities as an aggregate are.
111 2018-01-18 16:30:05 You always address issues related to us, whether it is rape, women issues, high petrol prices, price rise of commodities. Really like your channel.
112 2018-01-18 16:29:57 It’s a democrat strategy, because in the end, people are simply commodities to them, to be used as needed and thrown away. All the while professing how much they care. It’s easy to “care” at taxpayers expense.
113 2018-01-18 16:29:31 The real objective of development should be to create an enabling environment for people to enjoy long, healthy and creative lives. Thought this may appear to be a simple truth, it is often forgotten in the immediate concern with the accumulation of commodities and wealth.

242 2018-01-18 06:24:06 The people you should be blaming work in the FIRE industries, who turned homes into commodities, and put financial gain above an attainable "American dream," not those who work in Seattle, either as service workers or technology professionals, and cannot afford to live there.

247 2018-01-18 05:55:42 Adoption isn't "altruistic" in many cases - it's exploitative, of both poor women whose children are #taken and of the children, who are treated as commodities.
248 2018-01-18 05:53:14 Then why price is  rocketing of petrol and essential commodities. Don't make fool to people.
249 2018-01-18 05:36:47 Yo la verdad es que no sé a qué se deben las subidas pero hay algunas cosas que no me acaban de cuadrar. Sobre todo la caída de los bonos y USD junto con subidas de commodities. Creo que la cosa está para andar con mucha prudencia, pero como siempre digo, el precio manda.
250 2018-01-18 05:22:18 ....now throw in super hot commodities and Global higher rates in the months to come (as unwinds slowly occur) = BoC needs to continue to hike.  So, why the dovish tone?

A tariff, actually a list of commodities along with the leviable rate (amount) of customs duty.

256 2018-01-18 04:49:22 Maybe when they talk about diversifying they are talking about different markets, like Crypto, stocks, real estate, commodities.
Markets usually move unanimously, I don't see much benefit in diversifying too much in one particular market and ignoring all the others.
257 2018-01-18 04:47:18 Mexico is the largest buyer of American agricultural products. Specifically corn and wheat. Piss off Mexico and they purchase commodities from other countries.
Who loses? American farmers.

258 2018-01-18 04:29:04 How it has changed the global economy. Until very recently, speculation on most commodities, currencies, stocks etc were limited to brokers, or rich people going through brokers. Now everyone and their dog can do it. How has that affected the ratio of value to cost?

262 2018-01-18 04:08:20 perhaps the weaker base metal prices yesterday was the result of the stabilising USD, its rocky tone over the past two weeks has been the reason for positive advances for many commodities, especially in metals.

267 2018-01-18 03:48:03 I’m particularly annoyed with the attempts at pitting friends against each other.  Despicable behaviour.  Friendship is fragile on this app and for good reason.  Trust and respect are rare commodities. Protect your character at all costs cuz it may save you in the long run!
268 2018-01-18 03:21:23 Of course it increases prices. Please compare the average national price of commodities not exempt from toll with the prices of the same commodities in J&K. In some cases the difference is more than 60%!!

279 2018-01-18 02:13:44 I said it "kinda sorta did." In some areas where you had trading networks, there'd be commodities that were used more commonly than others and became money. The classic case is pepper in Europe pre-Italian city-states.

280 2018-01-18 02:13:33 Makes sense, but doesn't this still simply reaffirm the rather erroneous idea of a hermetically sealed Ancient Greece and Rome, when there is evidence that there were rather large networks of ideas, commodities etc. that included Mesopotamia and India?

283 2018-01-18 01:57:55 @benshapiro which are consumed as to avoid the question of nihilism. 
This is how consumerism functions. Commodities are wholly consumed as it offers meaning in our meaningless consumer society, only to be re-invented or re-produced with a new novel form.
284 2018-01-18 01:57:51 Yep. Drugs are commodities. Try @GoodRx to compare price too

286 2018-01-18 01:56:24 @benshapiro You call yourself a pure-capitalist and a conservative. How does capitalism conserve anything? Capitalism functions via the re-invention of commodities in-line with the fetish of the masses. Hence the constant re-invention and production of new genders, identities...

292 2018-01-18 01:03:54 I'm talking about a direct peg. Which I thought was obvious but now i will state explicitly so there is no confusion.

Modern monetary systems are not directly pegged to physical commodities. They once were, they are no longer.

297 2018-01-18 00:11:45 Despite popular request, I have no plans to add house blueprint selling. I've always meant for them to be collectible items rather than commodities. It's also balanced in terms of progression. If I let people sell blueprints I'd have to increase house prices to match.
