36 2018-08-14 22:09:44 Duh.  Look what’s moved in there.   It’s strategic.  Somehow the thought is people will get used to it and accept so we can then move on to using them as sex toys, punching bags, commodities for sex and fluids.  So then (if they survive) they will grow up and do the same.
37 2018-08-14 22:02:48 The vaultoro exchange has been live for 4 years with 99.8 percent up time. People have traded Tons of gold over the years and we are proudly still the only crypto commodities exchange. If you have any questions feel free to ask anytime.
38 2018-08-14 21:53:07 Our CEO @JulieLerner spent an hour today discussing #commodity markets for New Directions in Commodities Research, an event organized by @jpmorgan’s Center for Commodities and #CUDenBusiness.
39 2018-08-14 21:50:34 Sergio, el aceite de soja o la harina o el biocombustible es tan primario como el grano mismo. Son commodities con un escaso valor agregado que no generan empleo de relevancia. No es malo exportar commodities en cualquier grado de elaboración. Lo malo es depender de ese sector.
40 2018-08-14 21:37:01 He said he was gonna tell his parents someone stole it or robbed him. Those shits were hot commodities, especially if they already had games on them.
41 2018-08-14 21:33:27 Goods transported by air/sea have increased as well as people. The same commodities pass each other in transit which, if addressed, could reduce some of this. Or we could all start producing for local consumption again.
42 2018-08-14 21:20:02 So, I assume the list 837 commodities was produced.

58 2018-08-14 20:22:55 It’s a mos-reading of his 1983 paper, ‘Poor, relatively speaking’, where he discusses shame as a toy example to draw the distinction between commodities and capabilities.
59 2018-08-14 20:22:04 Is there any correlation with the commodities prices of those materials around the time of publication?
60 2018-08-14 20:21:34 Fuel cost affects almost every aspect of life. Charging 16 per cent VAT on fuel is like charging  32 percent on commodities which are on 16 per cent VAT already . This Will definitely raise price of most commodities almost  double. Think of the Mwananchi Who can't afford a meal.

77 2018-08-14 19:27:06 Basic commodities including mealie meal, rice, cooking oil and flour. Prices of these mostly affect the poor who normaly survive on a very narrow diet.
78 2018-08-14 19:19:26 Sure... And I think we're seeing players like Margot and Renfroe improve. Bullpen arms have been through extreme improvements. And under his management worthless players have become tradeable commodities.
79 2018-08-14 19:18:41 When will the so-called news media wake up and realize the elites of the world don't give a rat's ass about free press or journalists. They are cheap commodities to the elite, just like all other humans not in the club.
80 2018-08-14 19:08:14 Can't wait. I'm a start-up funder & big fan of quality journalism.

With this in mind I request that you don't do a traditional editorial/opinion/endorsement section.

Opinions are not commodities in the age of social media. Please concentrate on hard news reporting. #copolitics

96 2018-08-14 18:23:53 Crypto assets captures it better. Each asset has a set of properties that define it. The weak analogies to gold, money, shares, commodities, securities don't do justice to the inherent flexibility of these protocols.

In 2010, BO & Dem Congress were 1st to let China gov buy a US energy co. Why’d BO gov let a Chinese co buy world’s largest pork co, Smithfield Foods?

142 2018-08-14 15:23:49 Capitalism is a great system for those gifted at selling electronics, stocks and commodities. It doesn't offer any solutions for systemic problems like poverty, lack of healthcare, food, soaring rents and mortgages.

150 2018-08-14 15:13:17 Seriously? After many decades of EU’s promotion of concepts like ‘expansive austerity’, forcing member states to privatize public services and commodities and making it impossible for governments to intervene if they failed, in the name of budget discipline? Silence is gold here.
151 2018-08-14 15:12:00 If you're still wondering why USD/CNY affects #Soybeans, #Wheat, and #Cotton, consider this: "For commodities such as soybeans, wheat and cotton, more than half of the production is exported." #Fundamentals

156 2018-08-14 14:47:11 The shame for what you wrote keeps persistent though. You know perfectly the EU imposes privatizion of public services and commodities and government’s budget discipline. They put the people in the hands of financial market, and people die!!

158 2018-08-14 14:44:45 Correct! The EU imposes  the privation of public services and commodities and at the same time requires budget discipline. It is a monstrous institution that like Cronos feeds on its children in the name of financial markets.  Time to react to this shit!

199 2018-08-14 11:37:35 The 8th is a secular law that simply instructs us to uphold the rights of both if practical.

202 2018-08-14 11:25:27 Bitcoin doesn’t need an ETF or futures contracts, nor did stocks, bonds or other commodities. I agree. That said ETFs/financialization brought more liquidity, increased price stability/curbed volatility and created an increasingly safer environment for low cost managed ownership.

228 2018-08-14 08:15:28 YES! The conversation with my mom went on for 3 hours after, later my dad joined - I started telling them history of colonization, going back to the East India Company, the mercantile Empire, the story of commodities, of pepper, cotton, tea and sugar.
229 2018-08-14 08:14:14 As Kenyans we should start boycotting some of this products that are a threat to our health. 
The government should take the responsibility of importing some of the commodities and impose high taxes on the cartels.

230 2018-08-14 08:09:15 I recommend to play some Commodities too. Learn OIL, Gold & Silver too.
231 2018-08-14 08:05:17 reflects the pre industrial phase where agricultural produce made nations rich. Run was of comparable value to Manhattan at the time of the deal. The dealmakers had no way of predicting the shift in value from agri commodities to real estate.

237 2018-08-14 07:38:16 Most African countries struggle to produce what their populations consume. Even South Africa imports a far too large quantities of commodities for consumption. Industrialisation or re-industrialisation is the way to go.
238 2018-08-14 07:38:01 China Fixed Asset Investments, the big engine of its growth for decades (along with exports) grew by just 5.5% in Jan-July 2018 slowest since 1999 as China has tried to control the debt fueled growth.
Negative for commodities in general.
239 2018-08-14 07:30:18 Austin is correct.  Internet service is a commodity.  You don't have a right to them.  We ended that practice of having a right to commodities and services provided by others with the ending of slavery.  Net Neutrality is a Trojan Horse to give govt control of the internet.
240 2018-08-14 07:30:13 I saw the burden in this when I was a commodities trader. Regulations have been making it hard for US domestic production, but until we manage to repeal them, we found it was best to invest in companies looking to Africa for our mineral needs

246 2018-08-14 06:53:52 By now we should have other viable industries to absorb this labour but we failed to plan & now Rustenburg & other towns will become ghost towns Simply because of a lack of planning. Businesses go through cycles but pertinent questions about who decides price of commodities.
247 2018-08-14 06:39:03 It all trickles down to the subsidies which inturn are proving to be harmful for us. By govt. Intervening, price & supply of commodities is always affected. Which govt. uses as manipulative tactic.

253 2018-08-14 06:03:32 Another thing is that the kind of systems Ostrom & Braungart et al identified do not form a significant part of the global, capitalist production of commodities. Their implementation is either historical or experimental, they are not constituent of the present mode of production.

258 2018-08-14 05:34:45 Freedom is one of the most expensive commodities. No amount of money will be enough to buy freedom. It is the result of sacrifices and struggles of many brave,

259 2018-08-14 05:30:45 Sir erdogan regarding to the fall of economic crisis in Turkey having suddenly fall of Lira by the united States of America why not you make a rise of tariff in export commodities and we have to need a support of partnered countries
260 2018-08-14 05:26:36 Those gorgeous women you think are commodities bc they’re bad // the Women you’re just hype to bag or show off or get laid by for clout .. they have feelings.. they’re looking to settle down and have somebody love them for more than their looks.
261 2018-08-14 05:11:00 Yes true , but that’s in 7 years time , or more , a lot can happen till then , I believe the market has factored in the next 5 years of ev hype , the question is can it deliver , time will tell , and that’s what will dictate price of theee commodities

270 2018-08-14 03:41:16 I agree.  Biggest commodities at the moment are those that support survival.  Things seem to be ramping up quickly, but WTH do I know?  I've been watching this crap for years and it is RARE for anything economic to make sense.  So damn controlled!
271 2018-08-14 03:29:43 I wish there were a way to acknowledge the work involved in accepted ways of living, without conceptualizing even more human relations as commodities.
272 2018-08-14 03:27:42 prob have with idea that CB's restart QE or curtail QT is CB's are running headlong into big inflation in services & other areas while deflation is accelerating in commodities & certain other products...this is the nightmare scenario for them & they will focus on inflation IMO

289 2018-08-14 01:48:26 Sem indústria, nos consolidamos como exportadores de commodities.

292 2018-08-14 01:34:34 Hi Biren!  Full cycle yes, NT would point to our Macrovoices interview and slide deck fr a couple mths ago; we think Fed got spooked by rising rates in Risk off in Feb, had to support USD at expense of risk assets, led by EM/commodities but including US equities
293 2018-08-14 01:32:47 You would think adoption would skyrocket now except the crypto market seems to have endless bleeding these days. Even U.S. people/non-EM people should be going into crypto as commodities are good during stagflation which Tariffs cause + higher rates cause. And yet gold is down 2
294 2018-08-14 01:14:53 Si, hubo una suba de precios a mediados de la década pasada que se observó en todas las commodities, la ibas a sufrir inexorablemente vía costos (granos, balanceados), si exportabas te subías a la ola, Moreno no lo permitió, grave error de política
295 2018-08-14 01:13:07 A diversified basket of liquid assets (equities, commodities, bonds, REITs) are all liquid portable, inflation resistant, income producing assets. Can also be tweaked to individual risk preferences.

304 2018-08-14 00:26:01 Which is why they are working so hard on setting up digital identity and smart city infrastructure to turn citizens into social impact investment commodities to manage and control for profit. But it's very hard to explain this to the general public. Are you having any luck?
305 2018-08-14 00:19:47 Companies need to look at their commitments. It is difficult for companies to stop shipments unless there is an embargo. For many commodities pricing is in UDS.

Si queremos dólar alto, eso no puede estar dolarizado
