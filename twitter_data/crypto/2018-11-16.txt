3 2018-11-18 23:59:47 Just setting up my Twitter. #myfirstTweet
4 2018-11-18 23:59:47 Primary goal for this $crypto bear market:

Improve my #ta skills.

I've long lived the credo that #patienceismyedge:  As long as an #altcoin pick was fundamentally sound, time would make up for a bad entry.

This is a form of laziness.  I can be better; I must be better.

cryptoへの関心は如実に落ちている感がありますね。特に一時期熱狂した人が離れてしまっている感があります。(DAUよりもMAUの減りの割合が大きかったり)

14 2018-11-18 23:59:01 Imagine the first #crypto company focused on just making GUI interfaces for everything crypto.
15 2018-11-18 23:58:56 And then they thought about it more and changed their minds.  So?  You only operate on first impressions and demand everyone else does too?
16 2018-11-18 23:58:48 Ta would say no, strong downtrend on the monthly chart..
17 2018-11-18 23:58:31 Democrats take note: A lot of that blue wave will turn red again as soon as Trump’s racists and crypto-racists no longer define the Republicans. What will your platform be then?

27 2018-11-17 23:58:06 I’m not sold on that. Only a small % of people even really think about “the state” or “the Fed.” And they don’t think about or understand money.

59 2018-11-17 23:55:02 Fraud is a bit harsh, we’ve got a gamechanging product and very significant partnerships. This is just a debate over our approach to marketing and our level of transparency, which we have realized was not high enough. We should’ve been more clear and will be going forward

62 2018-11-17 23:54:16 Actually there is platform that will trade fiat against crypto. They have a coin: $incx. They will launch 2019Q1. Very interesting.
63 2018-11-17 23:54:10 Yes I’m aware as I use crypto every day but trying to understand what makes $XRP different and everybody says it’s because it’s going to be used by banks so I want to use it how everybody says it will be used and test it out.

72 2018-11-17 23:52:25 For sure. I enjoy my rewarding 9-5. But, it’s still not on my terms. That’s why I need to do crypto and my other projects.

76 2018-11-17 23:51:53 Sure everything what happens has a often a big impact. A wallet gets "hacked" or a whale sells  thou #btc and here we go. But it's not the end of the story. I think just 5 to 10 % of the world's population is #crypto friendly
77 2018-11-17 23:51:52 There has been a lot of downward pressure on precious metals price, but it's value will never evaporate, which I can't say for this counterfeit currency we have today.

I have some crypto, on which I'm behind at the moment. Not ready to give up just yet, though.
