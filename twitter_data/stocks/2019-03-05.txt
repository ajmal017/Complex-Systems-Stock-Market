2 2019-03-05 23:58:32 So excited for my investment plan. Waaaahhhh fighting! Stocks here I come lol
3 2019-03-05 23:56:35 Not if it's fresh stocks baby
4 2019-03-05 23:56:18 Just watched the @nascar k&n west  race on @NBCSN. This race is exactly why we don’t need the cup series on dirt. If I wanted to watch street stocks I can go to my local dirt track. “Stock cars” don’t belong on dirt. Want excitement on dirt, watch the @ASCoC or @WorldofOutlaws
5 2019-03-05 23:56:06 Chinese never bought Chinese cars. Stocks craps. Pump and dump
6 2019-03-05 23:56:02 I’m not gonna debate . I was speaking on “investing” into stocks not “trading” stocks it’s a difference from the term investing and trading
7 2019-03-05 23:55:56 ive already torn down your stocks. you have no market. your brand is deflated. Goodbye Gothmach
8 2019-03-05 23:55:24 HAHAHAHAHHA SORRY MA'AM UBOS NA STOCKS. HAHAHAHAH
9 2019-03-05 23:55:14 Going live on my #YouTube channel to go over some #DayTrading and #SwingTrading #stocks for tomorrow.  Search Bulls to the wall trading on YouTube and join me!
10 2019-03-05 23:54:55 Then sell at open I'll buy!! This is a OTCQB stock target .75
11 2019-03-05 23:54:13 Short positioning was huge in this and real money and HFs were seriously underpositioned. Seeing the same across many of these Chinese stocks. Scrambling to get long with earnings flying and the trade war seemingly de-escalating $HUYA $IQ $CTRP
12 2019-03-05 23:54:03 Me: *Finds time machine and goes back 20 years*

Young me: What stocks should I buy?

Old me: I don’t know but make sure to follow @Dictionarycom on Twitter, that shit it funny
13 2019-03-05 23:53:40 People who are waiting for Russian Palladium stock's to "save" the market like they did in the past will continue to wait.  All one has to do is listen to the Norilsk Nickel call last week to know that there are no Russian stocks coming.
14 2019-03-05 23:52:50 Because they’re petrified by you. You’ll need to be extra careful in dotting i’s and crossing t’s. They’re already slamming a .01% transactional tax on trading stocks, bonds, etc. FIGHT FIERCELY & WITH PRECISION.
15 2019-03-05 23:52:43 It’s steak and BJ day soon as well, so plenty fellas having to make do with a pot noodle and wank. Kleenex stocks will be diminished yet again 
16 2019-03-05 23:52:17 But, on the contrary, if they have massive insider buying (like your handle), then it would be a huge positive sign for the stocks - they think it is under-valued

They have many reasons to sell (buying a new house or Yacht); but they have only one reason to buy, that is "profit"
17 2019-03-05 23:51:29 He needs the medieval stocks treatment.
18 2019-03-05 23:50:46 Trade stocks oe twitter
19 2019-03-05 23:50:30 Leslie is a siren who trades stocks as a day job.
