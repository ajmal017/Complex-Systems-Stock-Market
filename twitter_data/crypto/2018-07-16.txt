0 2018-07-16 23:59:48 Those are good ones! Hard to tell with this market, but once $ICX fully integrates, there’s nothing stopping it. Team of 50+ building the ICON empire. My guess back in Jan was $40 minimum.. and it’s not out of the question yet. Fundamentally king of crypto.
1 2018-07-16 23:59:44 Have you ever thought about auditioning for SNL?
2 2018-07-16 23:59:39 I suggest looking into crypto. The us government as well as the rest of the world are becomong obsolete as people realize our best path is to trust in ourselves and not elected officials.
3 2018-07-16 23:59:39 Looking around at all the $btc #btc analysts, it appears only 1 or 2 respected ones are still bearish.  Either they are late to change bull or the eurphoria of a chance to break $7K is way too high.
4 2018-07-16 23:59:33 Spot on!
5 2018-07-16 23:59:06 Every person in crypto is either A) trying to accumulate as much bitcoin as possible or B) trying to accumulate as much fiat as possible. The promotion of shitcoins is simply for these reasons only. As of yet no one has written the Altcoin standard. I would like to see that book

すぐヤレそうなレベルの人しかナンパしないよね。
8 2018-07-16 23:58:57 Possible something like 6900-7000 to 6650-6700
9 2018-07-16 23:58:42 Jeez, another merchant swallowing the " #BCash  is a legit crypto" swill. It's not. It's a centralized scam coin + cult of personality (and not even a good personality). Other than that, Flexa looks work looking into.

12 2018-07-16 23:58:18 On the crypto cycle, my view - not a deep bear market, 2014 bear market in a different era - not comparable, every investor waiting for the bottom means unlikely to happen, bear market cannot be a consensus view. Awareness, project development, mainstreamization building up.
13 2018-07-16 23:58:10 Maybe a lil pull
14 2018-07-16 23:58:01 lol, im beginning to think your trolling. @Ripple isnt a cryptocurrency >.<

16 2018-07-16 23:57:44 I got a gut feeling that $nobs is going to explode in the next year. A review aggregator of ICOs that pays people in $eth but you put bets into review the ICOs with the #NOBS token, where after those tokens are burned. It looks like holding or spending, you can make money #crypto
