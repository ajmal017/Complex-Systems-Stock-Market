38 2018-08-22 22:19:39 COT reports ‘sort of’ are useful in currency markets, problematic in commodities, often unreliable in fixed income markets and almost entirely useless in equity indices. 10-15 years ago I used to pay a lot of attention to COT reports, now I’ve largely replaced it in my framework
39 2018-08-22 22:10:34 Best/worst performers -  Commodities today:

40 2018-08-22 21:59:40 Esses idiotas úteis já estão no nível de doentes mentais. Não adianta falar que na época que o ladrão assumiu as nossas commodities estavam em alta, o país estava nas "vacas gordas" e mesmo esfregando os fatos na cara, não querem enxergar. Melhor você discutir com um chimpanzé!
41 2018-08-22 21:40:06 Wrong.. Why are lying bruh..?? All immediate relief funds and commodities costs much more than that.. and the help continues
42 2018-08-22 21:39:45 right, either way you're paying the piper this year.  Time to TLH your commodities exposure
43 2018-08-22 21:35:19 That's just one scenario to consider. I think stagflation scenario is also possible at this point. FX and commodities may prove useful again in the future.
44 2018-08-22 21:30:00 We had the pleasure of living through TWO major technological revolutions. During our lifetimes, computers went from being rare, finicky gigantic monstrosities, to household commodities. AND, we saw the cellular/smart phone become commonplace.

Still waiting on the flying car.
45 2018-08-22 21:21:19 Commodities may very well lead to new friendships, but true friendships last beyond the use of the commodity.
Commodities can be goods or people, such as athletes!
46 2018-08-22 21:18:54 My own business is the difference b/w 2015 & 2019 in terms of standard of living! PDP regime was far better for me & other Nigerians but I don't know about you! Take statistics yourself about prices of commodities & harsh policies of govt! In Edo under PDP, we paid little tax
47 2018-08-22 21:13:55 If Fiat fails Crypto will become unusable. Tradeable commodities like food, water, gold , tools, medicines, vehicles will become currency. Go to Laos where currency is not trusted and they store spare value in cows, land, gold or USD  not a bank or bitcoin.
48 2018-08-22 20:44:05 Acho que não aproveitou como deveria. É a estória do cara q ganha 10% de aumento e fica feliz, mas outros na empresa ganharam 20%. Universidade foram 4 (as outras foram divisão de existentes), dívida externa foi na verdade troca p dívida interna, reservas p causa das commodities
49 2018-08-22 20:44:01 I think trade printers are treating their print offerings as commodities. Which is super frustrating to try to resell their "product" because they don't have one. Everything is custom, so everything sounds expensive before you even quote it. #printchat
50 2018-08-22 20:40:23 America's lone keg company is blaming steel tariffs for increasing business profits, not the supply and demand equation.   The demand for steel is up while beer and soda sales are down.  The main factor in pricing is almost always due to S&D.  Just look at farm commodities.
51 2018-08-22 20:23:37 “Borsch, vodka and RDX” would make a great memoir. 2nd volume after “Kalashnikovs and other commodities, a strange story of PR and other disreputable trades” @EllaMinty
52 2018-08-22 20:20:10 Commodities are sold on futures, therefore, it's not this years crop but next years crop that is of most concern...?
53 2018-08-22 20:17:00 Awesome talk at #DSMPLS from @Robert_Rose: In storytelling, “facts are commodities.”
54 2018-08-22 20:16:44 Cioè... o i prezzi delle commodities vanno alle stelle (ma la vedo difficile, fatta eccezione per l’oro) o crollano i corsi azionari.

62 2018-08-22 19:38:05 Commodities priced in yuan doesn't imply anything other than chnages in fx rates. Looking at CNY spot prices or the premium/discount on local Chinese markets does.
63 2018-08-22 19:35:44 O ponto é q p se comparar governos é necessário ponderar o cenário externo em cada momento. O PIB brasileiro tem alta correlação com o preço internacional das commodities, que estavam em alta histórica no Gov Lula. Acho q ele n conseguiu maximizar esses benefícios.

70 2018-08-22 19:21:21 An interesting challenge to US hegemony; the question is whether trade will be invoiced in other currency (while energy commodities are in US$), and if central banks will hold less US$ dollars as shares of their reserves.

72 2018-08-22 19:10:59 I think super traditional is more resources/caretaker. But then again, women were commodities in the super traditional which was a highly exploitative system.
Attractiveness itself has always been an issue for both genders and I think women judge men as harshly as men judge women
73 2018-08-22 19:08:35 Sorry, this is a stupid statement. The RUS economy is not and has never been fundamentally stable. It is almost an entirely extractive economy hostage to the prices of a few commodities. Get a new colleague.
74 2018-08-22 19:08:07 A crise atual ocorre pela economia baseada em venda de commodities, o embargo dos eua é uma forma de tentar controlar o país ( como faz com Cuba e as ditaduras militares na América latina). Concorde q Chaves e maduros implantaram um governo pouco ...

92 2018-08-22 17:52:10 Jorge confundes la fiebre con el termómetro. Menos mal que no eres médico. Lo que le pase a Chile depende más bien de los precios de los commodities. El empleo es el principal afectado con las crisis internacionales.

95 2018-08-22 17:45:23 En un país como Chile- exportador de commodities en un 78% y abierto a la Economía Internacional - el crecimiento o recesión viene principalmente de afuera. En todo caso, Chile tiene un sistema Tributario Regresivo (Pagan + los + pobres). Eso se va a acentuar?

The US will simply not export enough US dollars to meet the working capital needs of the rest of the world, as production will have relocated to US.

105 2018-08-22 17:09:06 RE: "I sincerely hope China can reform"...they're not going to reform.  They're going to keep using USD's earned via trade to buy up finite supplies of world commodities & then change the pricing of them to CNY so they don't need USD's anymore.

119 2018-08-22 16:20:02 Exato, governo maduros é muito ruim além de muito corrupto tomou medidas bem bostas para sair da crise. Chaves tb errou no passado quando teve chance de diversificar a economia mas ficou só na venda de commodities( q torna a economia bem instável)
120 2018-08-22 16:18:49 "What is the "Free Market" based upon?"

Voluntary exchange. Choice. Individual determinism. Respect for other people's property. It's the platform upon which we build our private sector businesses that provide the commodities people want.

122 2018-08-22 15:59:30 so what youre saying is, “do you use commodities introduced into everyday life by white people in your day to day?” indigenous people had no carbon footprint before colonizatio. all of this is a white doing. whites introduced capitalism and then forced everyone to follow suit.
123 2018-08-22 15:58:16 Why don't we send out signals every day? If we told you that we could deliver X amount of signals per day that would be false information. The market changes every second so nobody can predict how many trades they will get tomorrow. #forexsignals #Commodities #cryptocurrency
124 2018-08-22 15:56:50 Most welcome always and there is many more. In Kenya people passed a Constitution that is affecting everything in terms of commodities. Majority even didn't understand what they were going to vote for and now it's making life expensive everyday.

128 2018-08-22 15:47:28 David that's a great question. I think, as we've seen throughout history, certain commodities can also be used as currency. Gold, silver and copper are prime examples. Would love to hear any other insight on this! #cryptocurrency

130 2018-08-22 15:38:16 Your not understanding what I meant.  To control inflation narrative, you have to control All commodities.  Hence why there’s leveraged futures with unlimited limits.  It’s easy to control.  See Volkers comments in the 70’s.This time their objective is to not lose that narrative
131 2018-08-22 15:36:42 Why don't you just get over into the futures market and trade the individual commodities directly?

135 2018-08-22 15:29:45 Gold is about independence (2): that gold has minimal industrial utility is its strength, not a weakness. Unlike industrial commodities, gold is independent from the business cycle, which makes it an effective safe haven during inflationary, deflationary &/or systemic crises.
136 2018-08-22 15:24:29 Commodities Rosie 8% in 2017 but are down 10% in 2018. That means commodities are down 2.8% for 2016 levels never mind adjusting for inflation

140 2018-08-22 15:16:39 Silver's open interest chart over the last 10 years looks nothing like the commodities you just named.

And there is a reason for that.

The USD is supposed to be a weight and purity of silver & gold, depending on unit, but since the dollar is no longer, govt must suppress price

What's really happening is all the $ velocity is chasing a small amount of popular severely overvalued assets.

159 2018-08-22 14:15:48 I'd rather give taxpayer $$ to American farmers instead of giving our hard-earned money away in foreign aid, manipulated commodities pricing or blatantly inflated costs for products, goods & services that are increased specifically because it's the US consumer footing the bill.

161 2018-08-22 14:14:58 Also worth remembering that the political elites being negotiated with don’t have command & control over the rural population especially in the absence of viable livelihoods and in the presence of lootable commodities such as opium. Their support cannot be guaranteed.

224 2018-08-22 08:19:56 When money is loose, investors borrow to buy hard assets, which is why the prices of oil, copper, and other commodities have become disconnected from actual demand, and are moving together. - Ruchir Sharma

227 2018-08-22 08:03:07 Private sector banks are treating staff like commodities and the senior management seem to be working for share holders  only. It is just a question of time when one scam will take place in banking industry , RBI wake up .

229 2018-08-22 08:00:01 Rebalancing is also done to check % per asset class. Again, diversify, diversify, diversify. Once a year with regard to mixed stocks/commodities/obligations/bonds portfolios is usually enough. However, with regard to crypto it's a different story imo.
230 2018-08-22 07:56:25 Commodities: Gold rose 0.33pc to $1,194.37 and Brent climbed 0.58pc to $72.63
231 2018-08-22 07:53:58 You people just talk as if Buhari has the money to come and stop the inescapable recession PDP plunged us into..so u were not aware d reason for high prices of commodities? U want him to right d wrongs of 16years in 3years...we must all pay for ur planlessness.. unfortunately
232 2018-08-22 07:41:38 Reorganizing the whole might work better with smaller #communities #cooperating to produce & distribute essential commodities. Be more transparent about who is in need within the community & how to support & sustain each other. 
This is a better aspiration.
233 2018-08-22 07:41:28 First time I've been wrong asking a question.

I was hoping John may have talked about the relationship of iou's & commodities rather than a distinct choice

The gulf states are in a unique position of having an excess of a commodity over domestic demand
Are all exports good?
234 2018-08-22 07:21:09 It all begun in 2011 through a deal by IMF that they have been postponing.. Now consumers hav ebeen slapped with a 6% vat on fuel commodities
235 2018-08-22 07:10:46 The KEBS is full of greedy men who'd approve commodities without tests as long as they receive the cash. All these things point towards greed
236 2018-08-22 07:05:46 U need to tell me why all ur govs in APC are fond of giving ppl sorrows via inhuman laws like high taxation, demolition of houses & high prices of commodities! In short inflation is increasing each day! Tell me what happened- bag of was #6800, petrol was #87...face facts!
237 2018-08-22 07:04:52 Poor auditing? Downright criminal negligence Neil. True &,fair views are commodities to be bid for.
238 2018-08-22 06:59:56 Why breed these animals like commodities to be killed....they feel pain....they suffer!
239 2018-08-22 06:49:48 Be careful on shorting industrial commodities, folks. Big guys are turning bullish

243 2018-08-22 06:38:26 no sir you dont have a stock market where one of the biggest exchanges by volume goes offline during a trading session. that literally never happens in the stock market because those markets close. it doesnt happen in FX either or commodities

245 2018-08-22 06:14:41 The decision of Kerala Cabinet to levy 10% cess  on GST will defeat  the basic principles of GST The burden of cess  will ultimately fall on the people of Kerala who are already under terrible distress due to floods This will lead to further price rise of essential commodities
246 2018-08-22 06:09:21 With the rate of inflation, high cost of living, fuel prices adjusted upwards, prices of food commodities hiked, corruption, Nepotism, Mr @UKenyatta we have lost hope in your achievement of the Big 4 Agenda/Plan. Wacha tuambiane tu ukweli.
247 2018-08-22 06:07:09 #Commodities :

249 2018-08-22 06:03:02 Too much policing causes this. 

Make goods cheap by allowing every Tom Dick and Harry to import. Let there be competition in all commodities including petroleum and LPG. Best way to crush the cartels.
250 2018-08-22 06:00:07 Cultures cannot be "appropriated" because they are not rigid commodities, they are permeable and flourish when, as you say, they mix due to that endless curiosity we have about other human beings apparently 'like' us
251 2018-08-22 05:51:54 Conversa com um coxa
Eu:Lula alcançou a economia
Coxa: Ah mais ele aproveitou o bom preço das commodities
Eu:Lula distribuiu renda e tirou 30 milhões da miséria
Coxa:Mas tão todos aí novamente!
_Nestas horas dá vontade de dar um pescotapa e perguntar... Quem contribuiu p isso?
252 2018-08-22 05:40:09 It is good you know that price increase in basic commodities is a recommendation by IMF in a bid to help us service our loans.
253 2018-08-22 05:29:54 Lula pegou um país pronto para o crescimento, FHC fez algumas reformas macro econômicas basicas (lei de responsabilidade fiscal,  Proer) e Lula surfou essa onda impulsionado pelo forte crescimento mundial (com destaque para China) que alavancou nossas commodities.

259 2018-08-22 04:54:26 Gonna magic yourself up another source of commodities, ha? Probably at the same price, no less. 
Resources are finite, something lefties seem to have trouble wrapping their minds around.
260 2018-08-22 04:34:53 Commodities. Easily sourced elsewhere if the rural states won't or can't sell it. China had no problem finding other sources of soybeans.
261 2018-08-22 04:31:50 Truth be told,  wanjiku is tired,  we can't afford food medicines and basic commodities. #Jubilee is a scam
262 2018-08-22 04:19:08 Commodities are ultra-fungible assets most simply (although not definitively)  
263 2018-08-22 04:16:42 DHL no dey accept perishable commodities
264 2018-08-22 04:04:49 don't think of it as dollar down. Think of it as currencies up, risk assets up. This is what's *supposed* to happen--more borrowing of more dollars to buy other currencies and buy bonds and stocks and whatever else in those currencies. And US stocks and commodities.
265 2018-08-22 03:41:41 SONY sugar has been on the radar  over the misappropriation of Ksh. 333million loan from the commodities fund in 2017 #TheSonySugarConspiracy
266 2018-08-22 03:35:33 Pero eso es variable y dependiente en buena medida de factores externos que no se controlan. Guerra comercial EE.UU-China, precio commodities, etc. Falta claridad.
267 2018-08-22 03:25:05 Incluso si es así como dice, usted tendría que explicar por qué cuando hubo el boom de los commodities la economía venezolana no estuvo en crisis sino lo contrario; y también explicar gobiernos anteriores no-socialistas también cayeron en Venezuela.
268 2018-08-22 03:21:35 Early this year, SONY sugar was put on the spot over the misappropriation of Ksh. 333million loan from the commodities fund in 2017 #TheSonySugarConspiracy
269 2018-08-22 03:18:03 In the future data may be  important than anything. Datum's technology allows  to securely and anonymously backup structured data from social networks, smart homes, and other IoT devices. 
It creates a global data exchange by turning data into tradeable commodities. #datumnetwork
270 2018-08-22 03:17:55 La dependencia de los commodities fue un problema muy fuerte que tuvieron las colonias en África/América/Asia y los países recién independizados a finales del siglo XIX. ¿Qué le hace pensar que hoy en día ese no es el problema?
271 2018-08-22 03:16:59 Long term fundamentals remain bullish for most commodities, but with the world economy on a knife's edge, hard to make any predictions here in the short term.  Dollar is weakening and it's bullish for commodities, but we could be one headline/tweet away from an instant reversal.
272 2018-08-22 03:13:56 People really have to learn the difference between rights & commodities.
273 2018-08-22 03:13:54 Equities, fixed income, FX, and commodities can all move hundreds of basis points when the chairman of federal reserve, a supposedly private institution, makes an announcement.

275 2018-08-22 03:09:20 This despite the Commodities Fund in a letter dated January 18, 2018 notifying Sony Sugar that the Cooperative Bank guarantee provided as the security for the loan would expire on February 24, 2018. #TheSonySugarConspiracy
276 2018-08-22 03:08:30 @ril_foundation has extended arms of help to #KeralaFloodRelief by providing essential commodities and crores of rupees. Tremendous.
Where are other top industrialists and billionaire bollywoodians?

278 2018-08-22 02:54:19 The argument pretty much boils down to, "There's market manipulation in other commodities that have ETFs, what's the problem with there being manipulation here?"

The problem is that a single entity - Tether/Bitfinex - is drastically able to move markets in any direction.
279 2018-08-22 02:51:07 Só para realçar. O DXY está caindo há alguns dias, por consequência as commodities voltaram a subir. No entanto, aqui a bolsa cai é o dólar sobe. Justamente, em um momento mais calmo do dólar no mundo. Acho, no mínimo, estranho.
280 2018-08-22 02:49:35 Decir que ambas son la causa sería más honesto. La dependencia de commodities ha sido y sigue siendo fuente de fragilidad en economías emergentes.
281 2018-08-22 02:48:03 5. and account for non-static variables like electricity, water, and repairs. Depending on the business franchise fees are paid as well. Leases will go up, price of commodities go up as does cost of manufacturing napkins, straws, cups..etc..etc..
282 2018-08-22 02:44:25 Mises always conceded that labor time would be an effective methodoloy to compare the opportunity costs of activities/commodities as an alternative to money. Calculation in kind was solved by socialists in the 30s and computers have made it more possible today
283 2018-08-22 02:36:33 Because the IRS only goes after conservatives.  Didn’t she also deal in commodities back in the day?
284 2018-08-22 02:31:47 The fundamentals that underpin this are simple. The market itself...very complex. I was trying to explain why you do not see the same response as in other commodities like oil or coal. There will be contracts before 2020 but the panic contracting of U will not start until then.
285 2018-08-22 02:16:25 Drugs do not relax you, they turn you into a consumptive addict who relies on commodities to remain socially functional.

290 2018-08-22 01:52:56 I have considered this. Have you considered that the engagement may have been for perceived geopolitical and economically and militarily strategic reasons rather than ideological ones? Markets are more valuable to capitalists than commodities.
291 2018-08-22 01:49:20 Market Update - Ag commodities fell overnight, while the AUD is stronger on the back of a softening USD.
292 2018-08-22 01:44:01 How does a bullish dollar thesis set against a bond bear market react with trade wars artificially jacking commodities around like a bouncy castle? Answer: risk parity dictates over exposure on ammo, antibiotics and gas masks.

295 2018-08-22 01:27:08 The corporate definition of love is obsessed with commodities, property, and hoarding of things and experiences.
296 2018-08-22 01:04:25 Bengali Hindus are commodities, can be accommodated, transferred, shifted, their homeland Partitioned. Yes, we deserve that because we are interlopers from Mars.
297 2018-08-22 00:52:51 (3) yes, speculators drove the price higher than it should probably be. What does that mean? It means normal people should not be using Bitcoin as an investment vehicle. 

Speculation is something that happens to all currencies and commodities. It’s the reason we have exchanges.
