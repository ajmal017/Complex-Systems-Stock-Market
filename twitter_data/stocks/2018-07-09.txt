7 2018-07-09 23:54:28 By the way, domains keep me humble...but I keep trying. Stocks are my game. Two top 10 portfolio buyouts this week. Still an awful domain name, but I’m chicken at betting against.

11 2018-07-09 23:50:26 If you need to go the ETF route, Apple and Nike are not the best stocks for your money. Start with commodities or less expensive stocks. If a person's money is funny, they don't have years to see dividends so these big names are not the best buy.
12 2018-07-09 23:49:53 Look around on social media, you see animosity among traders, you see a lot of stocks diluting and some getting halted and because of the dollar volume slows until fall you will see every trick known to man to make a buck in the otc just keep watching.

40 2018-07-09 23:45:23 Lets be clear on something! INVEST in research before you ever invest in STOCKS! Buying stocks in companys like Amazon and Apple is not the move! Invest in a companies that’s gonna make Apple or Amazon BUY that company out! Get in the water before the wave, not after the storm
41 2018-07-09 23:44:53 I don't buy any stocks over $20. That is a stock option  the point of the thread was to show how beneficial invetsing can be over buying material items. My delivery caused the mixup
42 2018-07-09 23:44:29 risks are growing for stock market investors as the market heats up and stocks sit near record highs. recession fears growing or corporate earnings fall, share prices could tumble. That could put crypto HODLed portfolios in a good place, as people move over to this space!
43 2018-07-09 23:44:03 When you see #stocks such as $CCMP $TXN quickly recover ground after falling through the 50-day MA, then they're plowing through overhead supply bullishly. In the case of $INTC, to me the 16% correction looks perfectly normal. New base may form #charts #investing
44 2018-07-09 23:43:39 Jay-Z really released a song that basically said "Why don't more people buy real estate and stocks and just stop being poor?" and we just acted like it was normal

- Kavanaugh owns no stocks
- Hardiman has loads of stocks but sold off 18 cos. last year, possibly in anticipation of nom.
52 2018-07-09 23:40:03 I think if you made those wing stocks silver instead of yellowish brown, it would look pretty cyborgy.And I am sure we could add some leather straps too :)
53 2018-07-09 23:39:26 Thanks for the Q. We mention "overhead supply" of potential sellers when former leaders fall significantly in price in a short period of time. But many of these top #chip #stocks will likely overcome such "supply" due to strong fundamentals, leadership in their fields

62 2018-07-09 23:33:37 I used apple because it was popular much cheaper stocks,  that people can buy without going anywhere near the cost of a sneaker.  The tweet was meant to show investing isn't as expensive as most people think and can be done instead of buying material items everytime it drop.
63 2018-07-09 23:31:20 I also for the life of me don't get how absurdly low/sideways the bank stocks are trading - and for such a long time too.

68 2018-07-09 23:29:14 People are reallyyyyy missing the point and the mark here about this and it’s kinda crazy. Most people don’t understand the value in stocks and how beneficial they can be. Speaking In terms of LONGEVITY. Thanks for sharing.
69 2018-07-09 23:28:54 Apparently people who buy stocks are also people who program bots to manipulate the same market in which they are investing.

71 2018-07-09 23:28:41 For skincare, I really like The Ordinary for long lasting essences, serums etc. (they're really cheap relative to quality and how long the product lasts). Ebay stocks high quality face washes and sunscreen at low prices, too!

102 2018-07-09 23:07:14 Go google it then. How can you debate something you have no idea about. You spout that stocks don’t affect gamers and in the same breathe admit that Sega failed due to badbusiness practices. Bad business practices that affected their stock prices which led to bankruptcy.

You have the right to have  a weapon,target shoot,hunt, protect family I'd just like to be heard when i say no rights are absolute

No one needs 30 round mags, bump stocks, supressors,or buying 15 weapons a year

121 2018-07-09 23:00:24 Because bad business practices caused Sega to fail. Their stocks sank to the point of bankruptcy. You think the Dreamcast Owners that lost support for the console weren’t affected by it? You sir are a fanboy and need to quit arguing when your fanboyism it’s at its peak.
122 2018-07-09 22:59:51 Doris is the author, the  director and the main character in this dreadful political charade. Shame we did away with the stocks !

127 2018-07-09 22:58:31 Were they hedge fund managers? Or really into stocks?

140 2018-07-09 22:51:38 A young nigga just upped his stocks! 
141 2018-07-09 22:50:20  Review these #stocks that reached all-time highs: $TOT, $PVAC
142 2018-07-09 22:49:53 One wave of regulation after another has created a very robust equity trading environment. Stocks did not crash in 2008. Now banks are gravitating to the business of their own volition. You even see bond, fx and commodities traders relying on equity markets via ETFs now.
143 2018-07-09 22:49:25 This guy still thinks sales and stocks don’t go together.
144 2018-07-09 22:49:02 Yeah, Nobody is EVER a Bot OR a racist!
145 2018-07-09 22:48:39 No change in china .. stocks are dumb
146 2018-07-09 22:48:02 Why is it that I can trade tens of thousands of dollars of stocks in seconds. Buy things from any country in the world in seconds but paying bills online take 1-3 days to go thru?! Makes absolutely no sense
147 2018-07-09 22:46:54 She also. Posted I support of dr Stocks. Great find
148 2018-07-09 22:45:57 “Tonight, on a VERY special edition of our show..the ratings will be the greatest BELIEVE me! “.     Remember when Presidents made announcements in the MORNING?
149 2018-07-09 22:45:42 I love dark chocolate on everything, but nobody ever stocks dark chocolate versions of things except for dollar stores and 5 below for some odd reason.
150 2018-07-09 22:44:16 Mercury in Retrograde started. We are already feeling the effects but tensions will increase in coming days and weeks.

Hotheads will spew, patience run thin. Stocks will drop, politics heat up. Always happens. 

Best to stay cool calm collected to deflect neg slings and arrows.
151 2018-07-09 22:44:09 $BTC or stocks.  BTC is due for bounce because time is up on the daily.  BrST > 3.
152 2018-07-09 22:43:10 Hi would you care for a logo for this ? Rates do vary so hurry whilst stocks last.
153 2018-07-09 22:42:26 $SPY $SVXY $TVIX 
Seems like stocks could rally huge overnight.
154 2018-07-09 22:41:54 Also @PlayerEssence dont mean any offense by saying I do know stocks of there was any. This guy is just irritating me
155 2018-07-09 22:41:19 Why do you keep repeating what is already known. You need to prove that Stocks don’t affect gamers, so far you have failed at it.
156 2018-07-09 22:41:02 13 breakouts: $CHCO, $DEPO, $HELE (gap), $PVG (gap and 200-day MA), $WPXP. One $1-2 stock. No great numbers but stocks making the grade okay
157 2018-07-09 22:40:45 I do understand stocks and you are wrong @SenorPug26 you aren't keeping in mode stocks in general fluctuate, that's why its dangerous. The verge of trade wars will affect stocks and pointless tariffs.  Canceling a non gaming project in April will also make stocks fluctuate....
158 2018-07-09 22:40:22 Nagbaba stocks sa pldt daz why la kwenta net niyo
159 2018-07-09 22:40:09 I pick FUSVX because it's long term (my retirement fund), nothing will beat the S&P over 10+ years, and the fees are very low. I pick stocks with my side money because it's fun and in some cases I can beat the market short-term.
160 2018-07-09 22:38:28 and anyways kids, most of my portfolio is in pharmaceutical stocks
161 2018-07-09 22:37:36 Just like Bump Stocks?
162 2018-07-09 22:37:33 Yeah forget about the gains in stocks, record employment and the destruction of ISIS. This things don’t matter.
163 2018-07-09 22:37:30 do you have eurozone stocks allocation chart?
164 2018-07-09 22:37:29 there's a lot i need to work on as a player but it doesn't matter what happens i can be down like 4 stocks to 1 and at like 100% and they're at 0 and i'm like "okay i can still win let's fucking go" and don't really get upset if i lose unless i fucked something simple up

166 2018-07-09 22:36:24 I hear you!  However no one is teaching them how to invest & they repeat the cycles of what they see in their communities. If you know how to invest/stocks, then please teach three young men in your city!
167 2018-07-09 22:36:23 it’s so simple yet so good, i don’t use many stocks from packs anyways so it’s perfect for me, can’t wait for this one
168 2018-07-09 22:35:41 And you don't know why the Dreamcast/SEGA failed. When you understand that, you will retract your statements that stocks caused SEGA to fail. Lean "cause" and "effect" dude.
169 2018-07-09 22:35:20 2 technology stocks soared strong on Monday:
$AUO 11.1%, $STAF 301.5%
170 2018-07-09 22:34:55 @Twitter good that y’all cleaning up the place but it would be good to start at account creation else the cycle will just continue, and stocks will take unneeded hits - leverage Fb y’all aren’t really competitors
171 2018-07-09 22:34:52 I was trained to Always plan ahead or have a Exit plan,Work Plans,
Life Plans..investments, 
401k,private stocks,business ownership, health Plan,

Aaaaaaaah that's the one...failing to PLAN,is planning to FAIL..not an Option 4 me..
OoohRraah!
172 2018-07-09 22:34:30 everytime @PHORAONE stocks up his merch im always broke ouch *subbing*
173 2018-07-09 22:34:29 The smart people are learning to read Trump and realize these dips, when they happen, are artificial, and the stocks are gonna bounce back.
174 2018-07-09 22:34:20 Lmao on god, dont even think about investing in individual stocks unless you got 10k+. Not worth it.
175 2018-07-09 22:33:59 $ISR $1.40 +221% AH Major & bigger move coming IMO Nig #FDA #news Today and a good after hours filing!
 No. 1 to Prospectus Supplement is to suspend the ATM and to terminate the continuous offering by us under the Prospectus Supplement effective on July 9, 2018.
176 2018-07-09 22:33:22 Stop, you don’t know how investments work. When you understand how that works you will retract your statements that stocks don’t affect gamers.
177 2018-07-09 22:33:12 a friend of mine made a CHUNK off the scare, basically followed Cramer's advice, day traded some stocks that dropped reflexively, but recovered when people realized they had no footprint in China ( Facebook, Amazon, and a few others )
178 2018-07-09 22:32:34 And you clearly don't know what cause and affect is. Get back to me when you understand that. Btw, haven't found a single article that blames stocks for SEGA failing. And once again, open to live debate on the matter, something tells me you're to scared to do it tho. 
179 2018-07-09 22:32:25 If Nintendo, Sony, or Microsoft’s gaming divisions stocks sink to the point of failure, how do you think they will be able to operate without money? Not saying they will sink just using it as an example since you think stocks and investments don’t affect gamers.
180 2018-07-09 22:31:40 Newbie Question: What does suspended the ATM mean? i know that ATM stands for at-the-market
181 2018-07-09 22:31:28 Stocks are projected to fall at least 50%
182 2018-07-09 22:31:25 Yes, but I would have to make sure we are handling stocks and flows correctly.
183 2018-07-09 22:31:10 true-1. Ownership of stocks & other assets is highly concentrated in entrenched elites. The average household is disconnected from the stock market and other measures of wealth; only a thin sliver of households own enough financial/speculative wealth to make an actual difference
184 2018-07-09 22:30:12 Honey child, I’ll be just fine!  You see I’ve saved and my stocks are doing fantastic!  You, on the other hand, probably suck the government teat and my tax dollars give you a paycheck!
185 2018-07-09 22:29:43 Reuters - #Global #stocks hit a two-week high on Monday with #bank shares leading the drive higher ahead of earnings reports from the biggest U.S. lenders later in the week, while sterling took at hit after another British cabinet resignation.
186 2018-07-09 22:29:37 Google investments and then get back to me. The fact that you think sales and stocks don’t go hand in hand is laughable.
187 2018-07-09 22:29:00 Imma start buying stocks like sneakers. Take em home, put em in the closet and leave this 9 to 5 shit to y'all.
188 2018-07-09 22:27:56 Sum1 asked me what would I do if I won the lotto

After the guvment gets their cut along with the state and any other fees I would invest my money in stocks /bonds, real estate (residential & commercial) & invest in a start-up while having my own small business @M2JaspreetSingh
189 2018-07-09 22:26:05 I put it in FUSVX, and try to get in at a good price. I also pick a few stocks, based partially on market and/or technical signals.
190 2018-07-09 22:25:38 Deans you understand. The market fluctuates. This guy seems to think that stocks dropping won’t affect gamers. When in fact it will, stock drops enough and you will be pulling your money. You can only lose so much before you call it quits
191 2018-07-09 22:24:58 FAO has three categories, and the one corresponding to sustainably fished is the one now called maximally sustainably fished (formerly fully fished). The underfished one is for stocks that are very lightly fished or not fished at all. So this wouldn't work.
192 2018-07-09 22:24:43 Justin Bieber calling Hailey Baldwin the love of his life makes my heart break for Selena 
193 2018-07-09 22:24:33 Reading is hard for you. All 3 were sinking because that’s how the market works. Stock rise and drop on a daily basis. Sometimes for weeks at a time. It means nothing but to say that stocks dropping won’t affect gamers, it’s just ignorance.

197 2018-07-09 22:23:18 Sega bankrupts itself due to bad business practices. Stocks tank, company failed.

This guy : “Stocks don’t matter to gamers!”

Investors - “good luck keeping the company afloat and providing good products without my money”

This guy - “it won’t affect gamers!”

208 2018-07-09 22:18:13 It's all that extra cash corporations are using #GOPTaxScam to buyback their own stocks.
209 2018-07-09 22:17:55 Vicious cycle in stocks, where a new $SPX ATHs can bring presumption of Repub win in midterms. Gold could easily test under 1200,on that. But, a big new wave of overseas value buying will come in,between 1190 & 1230. Especially because ground war with iran or Venezuela is coming
210 2018-07-09 22:17:41 Stocks affect gamers who don't know shit.
211 2018-07-09 22:17:03 Toss a few hundred in stocks like these, sit on it for a year, and make like $30 if you're lucky. That's how you grease up that hamster wheel.
212 2018-07-09 22:12:56 Says the guy that think stocks don’t affect gamers 
213 2018-07-09 22:12:36 are you thinking an ETF or individual stocks?
214 2018-07-09 22:12:27 That’s not how stocks work but I digress....
215 2018-07-09 22:11:50 If that’s what you got out of the tweet it’s extremely obvious you lack any knowledge of how investments work. Bad business decisions affect stock prices, guess what happens when stocks tank?
216 2018-07-09 22:11:14 How was Avalon Code? I recall seeing it once upon a time, but I'm guessing it was niche because stocks disappeared in my area. :/
217 2018-07-09 22:10:46 Sure, u can only print so much money, which is why so much wealth is just a number in a computer. You get the ways credit & investing in stocks have destroyed the notion that money is a sign of hard work and good earnings, or the idea that scarcity applies in ref to money, 
 No?
218 2018-07-09 22:10:30 Yeah they do not favor risky stocks like those. We @ TrickTrades use them just fine with large caps though. No issues what’s so ever.

221 2018-07-09 22:09:30 @option_snipper hello and glad to see your enjoying your vacation!  a quick question on Parabolic stocks when you can...  what characteristics makes a stock parabolic- because on stockcharts the Predefined Scan Results show many examples .. thank you sir
222 2018-07-09 22:09:09 When “stumped” what to buy it tells me you don’t have a master-list of stocks you track and wait for specific signals. I track about 100 stocks regularly, some I add, some I cut. But I know on each one where I want to start buying based on my signals longer-term
223 2018-07-09 22:08:34 Want to know a great American tradition? Education and expertise.  So maybe a West Virginia mail clerk who obviously isn’t into stocks shouldn’t be offering opinions  on stock apps?

226 2018-07-09 22:07:33 I’ve followed FFIV since 2015 and have taken two entries. The first one stopped me out for a loss in 2016 and the latest got me back long early this year. Takes time for these setups to play out but I continually monitor groups of stocks over time and wait for the pitch
227 2018-07-09 22:06:17 I really do hope PLDT's stocks take a nosedive.
228 2018-07-09 22:05:22 The best advice I can give to you have to have a list of stocks you watch on all timeframes (Monthly/Weekly/Daily), even Quarterly. You want to buy as they base and turn on the larger timeframes. Have to pick your levels and have the plan ready ahead of time
229 2018-07-09 22:05:19 If you meet someone who stocks their fridge with Dr Pepper for you and makes you chocolate covered strawberries at midnight when you get home from work you keep them.
230 2018-07-09 22:04:29 YES.
231 2018-07-09 22:04:27 Please explain to me HOW SEGA failed with the Dreamcast. I can assure you it wasn't because of stocks. lol
232 2018-07-09 22:04:12 Download the Acorns app, Stash app, and Robinhood app (investing on training wheels). Download StockTwits app (Twitter for stocks) and Seeking Alpha app (complete breakdown of each stock data, news, etc.) and Investopedia is a website to learn all the lingo 
233 2018-07-09 22:03:51 No you're dense, you tried to make it seem like STOCKS were the reason why Dreamcast failed and SEGA had issues. 

That is your ignorance.
234 2018-07-09 22:03:06 I just want a girlfriend, a sugar momma or two, a friends mom that pines for the Goldman stocks to plummet so her husband offs himself, a doll that looks like Linda Harrison, and Katara from avatar the last airbender

236 2018-07-09 22:01:37 we're call it a #America vs #China trade war irrelevant. The magnitude is much more important. They are in a trade war, so far tariffs have been targeted for negotiation purposes. Let's hope they don't become blunt instruments for protectionism. #tradewar #stocks #investing

240 2018-07-09 21:58:25 I make a Lamb Ragu. I braise lamb shakes in red wine, can whole tomatoes, onion, tons of garlic, fresh rosemary & thyme, & a medium hot chili for 3 1/2 hours. 

I shred the meat, I shave the bones for future stocks, blend the braising mixture together. 
241 2018-07-09 21:54:55 I said the same thing. I wonder do these people actually deal in stocks 
242 2018-07-09 21:54:06 It's sad as other rivers stocks been decimated by agricultural pollution too over the last couple of years. I used to fish this river as a kid and it was full of wild trout. Sad times indeed.

258 2018-07-09 21:43:57 What would be wrong with 'sustainably fished'? So much of the language of industrial fishing - stocks, yields, quotas - implies exploitation and ownership.

268 2018-07-09 21:37:26 I’m sure they were there but I smell scam
269 2018-07-09 21:36:52 Oh no not again. I've been reeling for years since they dropped the hand dipped ice cream bar.  
Hey C you ever research any OTC stocks for potential +$$? AMFE pink has picked up a few inst investors. Rare?
270 2018-07-09 21:36:18 Update post close on Monday. Stocks up substantially, enough to hit stops on half the hedges, so TREND STILL DOWN, HALF HEDGES ON. Getting a little more aggressive, but still have some risk protection in place. Enjoy the ride!
271 2018-07-09 21:36:06 @ZurichNAnews ... I invested in some #stocks and hope they will go up, always? ... you agree too?
272 2018-07-09 21:35:59 Yeah, nah.

It’s to appease the bigots in America, who own tech stocks.

Follow the money.
I’m in NZ, no ‘sensitive’ tag here for these comments or the thread.
273 2018-07-09 21:35:40 I'm getting a lot of ads to learn how to trade stocks and increase income,  but I never searched for this topic.. Is Google looking into my bank balance and giving me pity ads? 
274 2018-07-09 21:34:54 At a job interview I was asked my hobbies, I said I love trading stocks & investing. My interviewer (also quite active in the markets) ask me to give him a quick pitch.

In Mid March, while hovering at a  price of $230, I pitched $MMM...

Down over 10% since.

Still got the job.
275 2018-07-09 21:34:53 Buy y’all some groupon stocks 
276 2018-07-09 21:33:18 No I actually don't.  The tweet was about investing period not about apple,  I have different stocks in the thread.  Reselling shoes is great but not many do that
277 2018-07-09 21:33:09 Tell that do Sega Dreamcast gamers back in the day  Yea stocks don’t affect gamers one bit 
278 2018-07-09 21:32:56 Do not chase: 

Good liquor 
Women 
Stocks 

The first is just good etiquette. The last two only end in heartbreak.
279 2018-07-09 21:32:25 Penny Stocks List Of The Best Marijuana Companies $cgc $nugs $mjmj $fwdg $mjne #mmj $mj $phot $ustc $sing
280 2018-07-09 21:32:08 That's good.  That's all the tweet was about investing in whatever you csn afford.  Don't go broke on shoes or stocks.
281 2018-07-09 21:32:02 Amen!!! If I were in charge no woman would have sex before she was married and if she did she would be in stocks where the good people could throw rotten produce at her! Bring back the Scarlett letter, bring back SHAME, bring back good old-fashioned MORALS!! Save our Country!
282 2018-07-09 21:31:51 Idk, IBM always seems to have a way of shooting itself in the foot. Been in and out of IBM stocks for a lonnnng time.
283 2018-07-09 21:31:37 Evening Market Wrap-up: stocks closed higher shrugging off trade concerns.
284 2018-07-09 21:31:23 2/ the wealthy than the average citizen.

Presidents don't really affect the stock markets much - unless they do dumb shit like start trade wars - and most Americans don't own stocks.

President Obama presided over a larger tax cut for the poor, working and middle class...
285 2018-07-09 21:30:58 After @rtrowe get me interested in the stock buying and mek mi wah give mi pickney stocks as graduation present?

Don't see that happening...
286 2018-07-09 21:30:29 And I do own a few shares in a couple stocks.
287 2018-07-09 21:30:22 Breh, a nigga was telling me in 2011 on here people who buy Jordan’s should invest in penny stocks.  I told him names 10 successful penny stocks and he blocked me
288 2018-07-09 21:30:08 Deux gars !? Mais wesh tellement tes stocks meme a deux il doivent venir
289 2018-07-09 21:29:13 Main niggas always saying they buying stocks while niggas buying shoes never have any revenue from said “stocks”
290 2018-07-09 21:29:03 by doing so, it will increase his DEFENSE STOCKS he and his,WEALTHT friends owns in the DEFENSE CORPORATIONS, this illegitimate jackass of a PRESIDENT doesn't understand and don't give a,damn, that these NATO ALLIES he is,condemning and berating are all from COUNTRIES that all
291 2018-07-09 21:28:50 My point was just investing really.  Not even buy apple stocks but anything that will make you more money longterm than over spending on shoes or clothes.
292 2018-07-09 21:28:43 It's crazy how you dumb niggas aren't on Wall Street with all this knowledge in stocks
293 2018-07-09 21:27:05 This just shows that stocks are greatly affected by FEAR.

That's why Trump craps on companies he wants to harm, knowing it will affect their stock valuation.
294 2018-07-09 21:26:45 Market Close: MBS -11bps; DOW +320.11; NASDAQ +67.81; S&P 500 +24.35; 10yr Treasury 2.86%; Stocks continued rally on Friday's Job data, MBS dropped while Yields rose a little further.

296 2018-07-09 21:26:06 Niggas killin son for that stocks/Jordan tweet. I’m crying
297 2018-07-09 21:25:40 No idea why stocks would go down except that maybe advertisers actually thought all those accounts were real, but they pay for fake 'followers' so maybe that's why.
298 2018-07-09 21:25:35 جزاك الله خير
299 2018-07-09 21:25:10 Of course, I wouldn’t buy most of the “momo” stocks up here for more than a scalp. I’m not buying $NFLX at a $175 billion valuation, or $TSLA at $55 billion, or $AMZN at $900 billion. They might go higher, but they’re too rich for my blood.
300 2018-07-09 21:24:20 @Ideliver stocks that crashed hardest are the ones that had run up the most. Profits and scared money left. $HUYA rebounded hard today.
301 2018-07-09 21:23:30 I will cosign that shit!
302 2018-07-09 21:23:22 #tricktrades is with out a doubt the best place for education on trading big boy stocks with minimum risk . So glad I found you 
303 2018-07-09 21:22:47 Please don't stop engaging. Remember stocks and stones. You know you're in the right, there's nothing they can say to change that.
304 2018-07-09 21:22:42 I don’t follow China stuff, and I prefer stocks that are in the making money stage. $TWTR would been a nice buy under $20 but I’m not sure I’d buy it up here.
305 2018-07-09 21:22:30 88% of children arrive at border NOT with parents but with human traffickers
306 2018-07-09 21:22:15 Yes there are.  The tweet was just about investing not investing in apple.  I own 0 apple stocks,  this is a stock option.
307 2018-07-09 21:21:27 Nah, THAT especially is what I don't want. I get dm'd constantly about stocks etc. I'd much rather not.
308 2018-07-09 21:21:27 Market conditions change.  Most of those videos were during epic bullish action in November when you have stocks like $LFIN ripping people's faces off.  We're in summer now, lower volume, less chasers. You gotta account for that. If you don't understand that, that's on you not me
309 2018-07-09 21:21:11 Just in the process of finalising the first step of our investment video guides. These will help you select an investment portfolio with the highest probability of investment returns. #stocks
310 2018-07-09 21:19:48 Já se bojím, že současná right party toho leadera nemá. 

@P_Fiala snad ... dáte to?
311 2018-07-09 21:18:46 Will crush you with my stocks and bonds. if it's alone.
312 2018-07-09 21:18:36 Just great, if I sell all my stocks, I can finally afford... a mortgage 
313 2018-07-09 21:18:21 I'm a liberal with a gun permit. I own a Glock. I was taught to shoot as a child. My step dad was ex military. He taught me proper gun safety. I would give up my right to semi autos & bump stocks, and more support more stringent background checks if it saved even 1 life
314 2018-07-09 21:18:16 I used to do penny stocks and I’d make maybe like 300 in a month or on a good day maybe 200 , wasn’t worth it for me
315 2018-07-09 21:17:43 Useful. Comparing YOY trends to see if increased exports are being simply replaced by more/other imports or creating net draws in stocks.
316 2018-07-09 21:17:18 "Watch what they do, not what they say." -- @maddow

Trump talks a lot, but when it comes to doing, he's a failure. Remember when he said that bump stocks should be outlawed after the latest gun massacre?
317 2018-07-09 21:17:16 As a small and individual investor, I am aiming long term and am bullish US stocks. I don't care the market pull back 5%, 10%, or 60%. I will just keep buying S&P stocks. 10 years from now, US market size could be 2x bigger. Markets outside are a mess now.
318 2018-07-09 21:15:43 All of $FANG stocks headed for their respective ATH. With $FB making it’s ATH today actually.
319 2018-07-09 21:15:38 Smart. Hey are you privy to these stocks....IQ, FEYE, TWTR, SQ and SHOP?
320 2018-07-09 21:15:35 A ty strany nemuzou cekat az na posledni pulrok pred volbami... musi se spojit uz ted... postavit stinoveho premiera a vladu a vytvorit alternativu s jasnym programem... pak lidi pujdou ve velkem poctu na namesti a vynuti si predcasne volby...
321 2018-07-09 21:15:27 Practiced some discipline and didn’t trade today. Nothing fit the mold of my strategy, so I pulled away and was productive elsewhere. #cashisapositiontoo #trader #daytrader #trading #daytrading #stocks #stockmarket @DayTradeWarrior @NYSElyDone @WarriorTrading1
322 2018-07-09 21:14:38 Not sure if there has been a direct follow up published and I've only seen some kobe plots of status at UW, but I wonder 
a) how many more/less stocks are now assessed?
b) what the most recent trends look like and do they reflect what we're seeing in FAO?
323 2018-07-09 21:12:03 Agreed. Can’t go wrong with buying and holding good stocks over a long time horizon.
324 2018-07-09 21:11:26 Tech titans' shares were up today, just not as much as non-tech blue chips. Nasdaq +0.9% vs Dow +1.3%. Of FANG tech stocks only Facebook hit a new high.

The Big 5, Monday gain and mkt value:

$AAPL +1.4%, $937B
$AMZN +1.7, $844
$GOOGL +1.1, $805
$MSFT +0.7, $783
$FB +0.7, $593

326 2018-07-09 21:10:07 When I find stocks I like, I buy small lots of them on a regular basis whenever they are trading at prices I find attractive... I hope that adds some perspective (and helps drive home the point that investing doesn’t need to be complicated.

329 2018-07-09 21:07:16 At #UnidosUS18 @julissaarce shares that only 17% of #Latino households own stocks & bonds. We have to rethink our relationship with money, retirement, life insurance, financial products that work for us & plans for the future. #UnidosUS18
330 2018-07-09 21:06:39 And yet stocks are maxed out. 
331 2018-07-09 21:06:32 I've been pondering buying some dividend appreciation index fund VDAIX at some point to try.  I own one individual stock for dividends, and the cash flow from it is nice.  I like growth stocks, but cash flowing dividend stocks are the most fun.
332 2018-07-09 21:06:30 Orrrr we can just stop producing cattle, enslaving them for milk and meat. Use all the land they take up to grow fruit and vegetables. Cancer, Diabetes, Heart Disease all drop to the the f*cking bottom of the scale. Jobs go up for maintaining fruit farms. Big pharma stocks drop!
333 2018-07-09 21:05:12 “Are, is” as in “Are, or is u dumb”? 

Oh yes, all that winning. Laughing stocks in the world, Putin’s puppet, trade wars, shattering NATO alliances, soaring gas prices.

The only person “winning” is Don the Con for having duped uninformed Trumpster cult followers like u 
334 2018-07-09 21:04:24 Good! If @Twitter @jack wants to kowtow to governments like the govt in Canada and censor parody let the stocks drop!

338 2018-07-09 21:03:13 I am a budding fan. The economics of the the stocks are wonderful, the multitiered relationships between players is excellent, and most of them are very player deterministic, meaning after setup, it's entirely in the players hands what happens.
339 2018-07-09 21:03:07 Con less human interactions and blanket algorithms tend to miss trends in the way a human advisor would. Pro easy to learn, and you don’t have to pick and choose stocks and positions. The system builds a profile of your risk/reward tolerance and rebalances your portfolio for you
340 2018-07-09 21:02:47 Stocks closing with big gains revved up by easing trade fears; expecting strong quarterly earnings.

353 2018-07-09 21:00:40 $study - very nice action today.  Remember how excited everyone was this weekend? That fade crushed them, but then look how stocks firmed up.  Position yourself for big moves, not quick gains.
354 2018-07-09 21:00:32 Haha tough talk no action. Just like bump stocks. Blah blah blah. Lies lies lies.
355 2018-07-09 21:00:29 What does a diverse #stock #portfolio look like? It might mean owning stocks of domestic & foreign companies, as well as large, medium & small sized companies. #investingbasics
356 2018-07-09 21:00:09 Have the index funds going, plus real estate stuff. Like the idea of playing with a few individual stocks (and incentive to find a little more to save).

359 2018-07-09 20:59:52 I heard that so many times though, people though I magically got the stocks or something
360 2018-07-09 20:58:44 What lies behind the design of a stop-loss order. Is this system needed if you watch the stocks closely, in case of an unpredictable event? #stocks #stock #StockMarket
361 2018-07-09 20:58:31 #trading is a lot more fun if you invest in yourself to learn more about how to do it successfully for the long haul, how to manage risk & how to learn from mistakes made. #crypto #forex #stocks
362 2018-07-09 20:56:33 yeah but dont feel bad, or give up, when you've started trading real money and dont turn a profit in a week, Shit happens, even successful traders will have a week, or months without coming out green.
363 2018-07-09 20:56:23 Stocks for formula companies seeing a lot of purchases because of China’s child limit policy ending. Trump’s friends investing. Also Nestle just invested a ton to double its formula production in Russia last fall.

365 2018-07-09 20:55:40 These are only major fished stocks, only <5% of the 15,000-20,000 species of fish in the ocean. If you were including them all then >95% would be "unfished"

371 2018-07-09 20:50:11 $dbx closed just over the 50 with the highest volume its had in 5 days. Seems to be breaking out of its downtrend I hope. Sold my $ichr shares and bought more $IQ. Still love all of these stocks.

374 2018-07-09 20:49:08 Costs go down and profits go up when: there are no environmental controls, there are no health and safety regs, when there are no employee rights. Increased profits don't usually benefit the average middle class worker. Got for stocks and dividends though.
375 2018-07-09 20:49:03 Lol.. I was just giving people information but this is just in stocks homie,  not my bank account for my savings but go off.

378 2018-07-09 20:47:18 The only thing N. Korea sign was an agreement to talk again later. And unless you’re a Corp or own stocks Tax cuts left you holding the bag to pay the 1.5 Trillon it added to the debt. Boy are you a sleep at the while of reality.
379 2018-07-09 20:46:51 The Stocks need improvement but he’s a good defender. Not elite, but good.
380 2018-07-09 20:46:17 It’s a Set-up photo op showing the Clintons aren’t elites they are just like us. Scammers
381 2018-07-09 20:46:11 Tax cuts aren’t free! Only the rich are getting richer - have you bought food lately? Cars are going to sky rocket! Homes are overpriced again and our stocks aren’t worth anything - gold & cars are the smart investments
382 2018-07-09 20:46:06 @DanielBisic hey Daniel, I saw your tweets about trading stocks. DM me
383 2018-07-09 20:45:57 V-mart is a good stock. 
D-mart is also good. 
Both stocks have different models. 
A direct comparison cannot be drawn just because of the industry they are in

385 2018-07-09 20:45:11 tady na politické scéně se vše spíše štěpí, než konsoliduje - už jenom tím politici ztráceji body, protože nedokážou ani dát najevo, že kvůli prosazení společné vize jsou občas ochotni potlačit své osobní ambice... ale potenciálních hlasů, co nechtělo volit MZ bylo dost

390 2018-07-09 20:44:10 It seems like giving short sellers the information that nothing will be done until after mid term elections with Fannie & Freddie is insider information. It gives them  Carte blanche to short with impunity. It’s no wonder the stocks dropped so low. Release them now.#fanniegate
391 2018-07-09 20:42:40 GDX/GLD ratio leads GDX.  Gold stocks outperforming Gold is bullish for gold and gold gold stocks

393 2018-07-09 20:42:14 more than 3 mo's out, calls on $VIX are a bad bet, it's not a call on the spot VIX, it's a call on the futures contract. If stocks crash & $VIX spikes, the futures >5 months out go up less than spot (curve backwardation), so you're paying for a lot of time for a lower return.

395 2018-07-09 20:41:02 Tight leash, loose leash.  My dog & I have an "understanding" when I walk him.  It's the same with low float stocks when you walk them either up or down.

397 2018-07-09 20:40:45 I don’t know how you guys even find these charts. There is so many different stocks to look at and check, what would even make you check this ticker? I need a better strategy for choosing which stocks to analyze.
398 2018-07-09 20:40:02 Nestle builds huge infant formula plant in Russia in fall 2017 doubling capacity.  This why?  Or, since China got rid of 35 yr old child limit policy it looks like a lot of rich folks are buying a whole lot of baby formula stocks.  This why?  @funder @maddow @cnn @EdKrassen

401 2018-07-09 20:38:10 Regular capitalism is just the private ownership of the means of production for profit - which leads to things like banks and stocks as the complexity grows. It's the economic system underlying society itself, whether that society has a government or not.
402 2018-07-09 20:37:19 The top five stocks that closed higher today were $NBL, $CAT, $MET. $COF, and $MRO.

405 2018-07-09 20:35:38 Smdh this one of the few things I don’t like about investing and stocks. Of course you can gain the money but also it’s a chance you can lose it too if you don’t pay attention and saving your dollars
406 2018-07-09 20:35:32 BREAKING NEWS: "Investors bought as many shares as they could today after promises that those who sold to them will buy them back at higher prices in the near future." #stocks #market $SPX $ES_F
407 2018-07-09 20:34:47 No. I know they will be here for a long time I’m just going to keep adding and only collect dividends from them. I don’t sell stocks that have dividends unless something happens.
408 2018-07-09 20:34:43 Exactly my point. less jordans but a few thousands in stocks might be more beneficial.
409 2018-07-09 20:34:36 It's okay @etrade I still love you even though I missed STAF because of the having to call in to place in order. I was able to focus in and get more gains on $ISR anyways!! 40%+!! DM me if you would like to switch brokers! I would recommend @etrade #stocks #brokers
410 2018-07-09 20:33:06 Can't wear stocks 
411 2018-07-09 20:31:33 Q3 is historically the worse one for stocks.

But what happens when the S&P 500 is higher in April, May, and June (like it was in 2018)?

Wouldn't you know it, Q3 has been higher 9 of the past 10 times (going back to 1980).
412 2018-07-09 20:31:29 I'm already being patience. But others don't. That's Y their stocks went down. If they revealed games it might come back up. But to me who cares about Nintendo is losing. It has to find a game that will make people to buy. They don't care about the Switch is not enough sells.
413 2018-07-09 20:31:11 Stocks rose Monday as political chaos in the UK and global trade tensions took a back seat ahead of earnings season. The Dow Jones industrial average rallied by more than 300 points, lifted by bank stocks. The dollar and Treasury yields climbed higher.

421 2018-07-09 20:26:46 Takto byl už promarněný výsledek prezidentských voleb - tady byl potenciál na to, aby MZ znovu nevyhrál... bylo to vidět na výsledcích 1. kola... ani v 2.kole MZ nedostal tolik hlasů, co byl součet hlasů pro 4 jeho nejvážnější soupeře
422 2018-07-09 20:26:31 Stocks rally. The Dow closed at 24,776.59, up 320.11 (+1.31%). Nasdaq +0.88%. S&P +0.88%.
423 2018-07-09 20:26:29 I said this is one of the reasons.  Yes slavery for 400 years,  oppression but not being financially literate is also holding us back.  Over spending on material items over investing whether it be stocks,  mutual bonds etc.
424 2018-07-09 20:26:09 Stocks I like near their all time highs: $MKC
425 2018-07-09 20:25:32 If you had invested $1 in U.S. stocks in 1900 and spent all your dividends, your stock portfolio would have grown to $198 by 2000.But if you had reinvested all your dividends, your stock portfolio would have been worth $16,797! Dividends are the greatest force in stock investing.
426 2018-07-09 20:25:29 .@RomyYYC and I once watched a woman whip out an avocado and 4+ stocks of celery from a wicker basket mid-flight. We, meanwhile, enjoyed airplane hummus. We learned our lesson quickly.

444 2018-07-09 20:20:06 We’ve all been there. When I first started trading stocks (first stock I ever invested in), I followed the advice of Twitter shillers and invested in SunEdison — lost 90% of its value in a year, thinking I could get rich quick as if I knew something others didn’t 
445 2018-07-09 20:19:48 If you’re not sure then I’d find out, but my point being, which you missed, was me being unhappy w/@TheEconomist incessant drivel about hard left issues instead of economic issues that actually have to do w/but not limited to investments, banking , stocks, bonds and the like.

447 2018-07-09 20:19:27 That tweet comparing Apple stocks to buying Jordan’s is pretty disingenuous. 

I applaud black folks who invest but...

You need more than on stock to become wealthy  and the idea other races don’t spend on lavish and/or frivolous things is not true.
448 2018-07-09 20:18:35 Fair point. But holding stocks that have momentum is not the same thing as using a momentum strategy.

458 2018-07-09 20:13:30 World stocks in broad rally: US +.9%; Europe +.6%. In a "whistling past the graveyard" session stocks pretended trade issues were nonexistent and focused on solid economy & 2Q earnings season. This is fine as long as investors keep to their long-term plan & don't get overextended

472 2018-07-09 20:05:26 Yeah, looks that way, doesn’t it? I think it’s because Japanese investors allocate very little of their investments to stocks relative to Canadians. And their stock and real estate market have performed poorly over the past 30 years. So low returns force a high savings rate.

490 2018-07-09 20:02:06 The largest shares of stocks are owned by those with ownership of the capital. More and more housing is getting consumed by investment capital whose main ownership is also consolidated in those already wealthy moving in on traditional middle class sources of wealth.

496 2018-07-09 19:59:30 Clearly U.B.I. Would not solve income inequality by itself. The main issue is consolidation of ownership and wealth. What does the average american own that produces income? Most just have their labor. Some have an additional house, some have a small business, and/or stocks.

531 2018-07-09 19:42:07 $LEDS impressive rally today. Holding overnight these two low float stocks $AHPI $QBAK for tomorrow. Low float stocks continue to impress
532 2018-07-09 19:42:00 Morgan Stanley posting on Twitter trying to suck in new money to fill the void they're creating by shorting stocks shows their desperation for new money from others to sacrifice. When somebody else loses somebody else Gaines the only way to gain now is off somebody else's losses
533 2018-07-09 19:41:59 As a trader I think you should know how float rotation works and the lack of shortsellers is likely what caused your stock to drop so harshly. Contrary to popular believe short sellers actually slow down the stocks free fall because they add bids as shorts cover.

This partly explains why the hubbub about "security tokens" is off the mark. Upgrading the system will only benefit the main industry players, not the masses.

795 2018-07-09 17:32:56 Have not seen any yet. NK played him, hes raised the national debt by a trillion and a half in 14 months, cut taxes on corporations that bought back stocks, woopie 6 million out of 160 million got a raise or a bonus check. So whats so great?
796 2018-07-09 17:32:03 He's just trying to blow smoke up our asses. See: bump stocks.

800 2018-07-09 17:30:54 Trump has probably pre-warned his friends to short these stocks.  Assuming he knows enough about it.
801 2018-07-09 17:30:36 Agree. My portfolio currently has the lowest allocation to biotech than I've had in years. In fact, at the moment, I have more money on the short side than on the long side of biotech stocks. FDA and adcoms continue to be flaky. Valuations too high for most bio stocks.

812 2018-07-09 17:26:18 Corporations do not feel “shame.” The same way corporations failed to give raises when they received the massive tax cut.  The corporation acted like a corporation and bought back stocks.
813 2018-07-09 17:26:16 it was a great deal for rich people too because they bought those stocks.
814 2018-07-09 17:26:07 who exactly is buying the stocks?

862 2018-07-09 17:06:19 Wages are not growing, businesses are buying back their own stocks and consumer confidence is taking a nose dive, because inflation is going up and wages aren't.  The tariffs will make it more of a disaster than it already is.  It will only get worse.

1078 2018-07-09 15:18:39 Put simply, the White House wants stocks to be as high as possible. But, Fed has made it clear that it will be focusing on real economy as opposed to financial markets. Jerome Powell has emphasized this approach in multiple speeches and Q&A sessions.

1304 2018-07-09 14:06:18 The hyperbole is off the charts here.  
1. Bump stocks not common until the media made them famous. They still aren’t used by most gun owners. 
2. They’re doing it wrong. Do it right and stay.
3. Obama befriended and gave millions to the murderous Mullahs of Iran. Where were you?

1307 2018-07-09 14:04:34 U.S. stocks are rallying in early trading on Monday, putting Wall Street on track to extend its recent rally as positive economic news, notably last week’s jobs report, continued to overshadow escalating trade tensions.

1309 2018-07-09 14:03:22 Stocks with the smaller market caps are the easiest to manipulate and push down causing investors consternation to the effect of absolutely needing to sell their shares because they're the weakest hands.  End of month coordinated strikes are the best times to do this.

1329 2018-07-09 13:58:01 The principle is same. If you invest x amount of money with operating costs and effort considered, what will your ROI be within a given time frame? In most cases sneakers have a higher ROI and its less of a gamble than stocks. The comparisons to stock markets are valid i’d say.

1428 2018-07-09 13:10:48 Morning Market Update: stocks trade higher as Jobs rally continues.
1429 2018-07-09 13:09:48 The best stocks to short today at pre market highs with tight stops $BBOX $BNTC $MBVX $NNDM if you buy these at major resistance your best case scenario is a quick profit, worst case scenario is you get stuck bag holding very quickly. I’m extremely short biased on these stocks
1430 2018-07-09 13:09:35 #US Pre-Open: $DOW Futures ↑+0.40%. On Friday, US Stocks gathered steam on yet solid Payrolls report, but sluggish wage growth & up-tick in Unemployment rate gave hopes of a less aggressive Fed. 10Y Yields rose. Personal care & Machinery↓. $DJIA+0.41% $NASDAQ+1.34% $SPX+0.85%.
1431 2018-07-09 13:09:08 Good open for $faang stocks, will be locking in some gains!
1432 2018-07-09 13:05:19 The U.S. added new #tariffs to goods from some of our largest #trading partners, and those countries promised their own tariffs in response.  While the drama has affected #stocks, #markets have remained relatively stable despite the escalating rhetoric.  @business
1433 2018-07-09 13:04:56 Anyone who buys these stocks at major resistance (pre market highs) is putting themself in a situation where there’s very little room for the upside and a lot of room on down side (bag holders) $BBOX $BNTC $NNDM
1434 2018-07-09 13:04:09 Most of the stocks follows TL including nifty..what else do u need ? July series would u give the surprises...

About Vegas. The murderer had about 50 guns or so, Doesn't matter if he had 6 or 500, he used 5. The only reason he used 5 in stead of 1 is he had
bump-stocks on them and that made them jam. He would have done the
same with 1 stock rifle.

1437 2018-07-09 13:03:41 Well, if this your average investor, it makes sense why Nintendo stocks have fallen despite their sales and other numbers still being good.
1438 2018-07-09 13:03:27 Good grief.  What the hell will happen if we loose?  If hope these morons are found, fined and put in stocks in the town square
1439 2018-07-09 13:03:23 Friday's overall volume was really light. So, finding stocks that did see above-average volume may give good notion of where inst'l interest is this week. Just a thought.
1440 2018-07-09 13:02:45 @fancycheeseco Hello! Long shot but do you know anywhere around Louth that stocks Young Buck? We know @SheridansCheese have it but our closest stores are Swords and Kells – we're based in Drogheda. If you could point us in the direction would be epic!
1441 2018-07-09 13:01:54 I’m expecting all of these stocks to crash today and see mutiple new low of day $BBOX $BNTC $NNDM the key is to short them at pre market highs / triple top and buy to cover towards the gap waiting to fill below at the previous closing price

1449 2018-07-09 12:58:52 Many Presidents have put their holdings in blind trusts. While Trump is unable to do that since he has tangible real estate instead of just stocks&bonds,he’s turned over management to others, thus maintaining separation. Also has attys & govt ethics professionals overseeing all.

1452 2018-07-09 12:56:48 Surely stocks will have a major correction at some point but all that news is just memes for the current price action.
1453 2018-07-09 12:56:46 But patience can, because in the longer term price comes back toward value, at least over a basket of stocks.
1454 2018-07-09 12:56:14 Exactly! They sold the rumor of Trade War. Crushed Chinese stocks & depressed US stock returns, which should have skyrocketed on the +20% $SPY EPS growth environment we are in. The key will be can cooler heads in China & the US prevail to not escalate the additional taxes!
1455 2018-07-09 12:55:00 I'm not sure about all the factors in economics. But I do know that if foreign countries dump our stocks and our currency is devalued, we're 2 steps away from becoming Venezuela. Vote!

1458 2018-07-09 12:53:29 We don't trade stocks heavily but the concepts are the same. The real differentiator is a stock can move based on the condition of the company but a lot of the same strategy does apply.

1483 2018-07-09 12:40:36 The graph can be misleading, i would say US stocks could be higher if not because of trade issues, so its difficult to quantify. In addition international markets (china and some other EM) have lower liquidity therefore higher volatility

1728 2018-07-09 08:58:19 Stupid move unless the company stock you're holding is going to be the target of tariffs, no wait the company will pass this extra cost on to the consumer or lay off workers. So why are selling stocks if you're not the one paying the bill.  Sounds like rampant speculation.

That he makes a freaking decision when it's needed without mulling it over for months. That he enforced laws and borders. He supports the American people and not divisive "groups."

2056 2018-07-09 03:25:04 GE is no longer a part of the blue-chip index. In the past, getting kicked out of the #DOW hasn’t been as bad for a stock as might be expected. The last 10 booted Cos have risen an average of 6.4% in the year after their  removals. @wsj #stocks #djia
2057 2018-07-09 03:24:18 We reached that under Obama, then we elected a President who actually works for the American people and follows through on campaign promises. Stocks, economy, employment...all up. Things are looking great now!

2070 2018-07-09 03:16:38 Basically, Markets are positive and bulls and bears should fight out today on 10830 area. Bulls have the best chance today to push bears out of 10830 towards 10900.

So expand UBC to other states? CA has?
Aren’t all rifles “assault” rifles? Or is it a model/type? bolt ok? But semi not?
Pistols are 21 now, so also rifles incl .22 & .17 (pellet)? BB?
Bump stocks seems more r/to paintball but ok. 
Ghost guns? 3D printers.
2075 2018-07-09 03:12:50 Agree 100% - also the staff is always in the way with full strollers blocking the shoppers . Why can't they replenish stocks more discreetly ?
2076 2018-07-09 03:11:55 I'm guessing she probably doesn't have actual liquid assets & would've taken a huge hit if she sold or liquidated stocks, annuities etc. Plus she had to fork over a large amt of money 2 Dean.

2080 2018-07-09 03:08:32 Some promising picks. Drones US (DRUS) is one I’d watch. I myself don’t usually play with stocks less than $5 unless many keys fit. Earnings, insiders, trend, low float, debt, and more are critical. If you get a winner, you make a lot, but one loser can be a huge loss too.
2081 2018-07-09 03:06:54 These are 5 Top FNO Observations - 

No Major change in index futures.

TECHM, M&MFIN, JUBLFOOD formed short positions.
Significant rise in OI in ICICIBANK in July series.
Tyre stocks rallied due to short covering.

2085 2018-07-09 03:04:45 Yes, a stock is only worth what it can be sold for but Wall Street has perverted the fundamental reasons for, and function of, stocks and bonds.
Apple (AAPL) does NOT build products based on “making money” but on the basis of creating the ’s best products. Look at its success.

2091 2018-07-09 03:00:35 Agree but IMO most pot stocks valuation are based on really wrong assumptions. I have a feeling that many would face the same fate as Valeant ($VRX) in 2015-2016. So IMO they are safer to short and the right timing could be after Oct. before their 1st earning after legalization.

2094 2018-07-09 03:00:07 $BLT very nice deal with $AXON. Investors need to get past the old $BLT and realise it is a totally different and better beast, then when they floated it on the NASDAQ. Along with $FTT, one of the most undervalued stocks on the ASX.

2171 2018-07-09 01:53:58 Performing stocks would automatically "scale" compared to non performing in ur portfolio. Do u further scale in and out on top of that?
2172 2018-07-09 01:52:54 Reminder: earnings season is upon us. Make sure you check earnings dates on the stocks you plan to trade. If you trade through earnings, it is recommended you do so with lower position sizing than normal. 

@eWhispers is a great resource for checking report dates
2173 2018-07-09 01:51:41 Penny stocks are harder to chart as they currently have sloppy price patterns although a rising tide should float all boats as we are currently entering seasonal period of strength. :)

2175 2018-07-09 01:50:39 @NextRevFNC  U r overplaying your hand with the importance of Wilbur Ross not selling his stocks.  If u r so concerned he made $1 mil + before he sold them, then u + govt. make him refund the money.  He's already millionaire, so this trivial amt. won't affect him.  Stop whining
2176 2018-07-09 01:50:33 @NextRevFNC Hey Steve. Leave Wilbur alone. You want to talk about swamp and corruption. How about how all of Congress can buy and sell stocks on inside information. Have a show on that. Why do you think they are all millionaires.
2177 2018-07-09 01:49:57 @SteveHiltonx Mr Ross needs to resign ASAP. He said he would sell those stocks and didn't. The buck stops with him.

2186 2018-07-09 01:40:40 Here’s an options trading question for everyone. 

If there’s 2 options with matching deltas, do both options carry the same risk??

2187 2018-07-09 01:39:49 Smasher just took 2 stocks from AK, 3 from Daybreak, 3 from WTTD, and 1 from Goof in a crew battle. It was nuts. We were down 11 to 6 before he went in, but then it ended up being my 3 vs Goof's 2 and I just squeaked by haha. It was awesome.
2188 2018-07-09 01:38:04 Correction - facts still matter

Trump year one:
- N Korea lied
- @POTUS policy separated kids
- @BarackObama surge axed Isis
- No such thing Christmas ban
- Stocks up at same %
- Corp. Tax cut. We get ZERO
- Planes crashing? Nuff said
- Zika? Try WHO

2209 2018-07-09 01:02:08 As per the SEC answer to that question. Authors are required to disclose if they are receiving payments for articles to promotes stocks. I am not receiving payments from MDXG or anyone to write opinions on Twitter. I just love business topics. This is a discourse about business.
2210 2018-07-09 01:01:58 I understand. I was just wondering what's the purpose for the scan? Couldn't he just pull up any chart and then evaluate the technicals? Is the scan to find stocks that are moving? Just wondering the thought process of the scan.

2218 2018-07-09 00:53:11 Trading stocks and surfing FinTwit is like driving in traffic. If you’re paying attention to how fast the cars are going in the lanes around you, you’ll end up colliding with the car directly in front of you. A costly distraction.

2227 2018-07-09 00:41:09 2000-2002 was huge as well. 2015-2016 was more of a "digestion" period, where stocks cooled after enormous gains. Did not feel like a bear market.

Wall St. is booming due to the tax breaks corporate received and bought back stocks. Wall St isn’t Main St.

The unemployment rate actually went up last month

The economy is growing at a slower rate under Trump than it did Obama

Obama > Trump 
2230 2018-07-09 00:39:40 You've had a very good track record this year from what I've seen.  It's certainly harder to pick 'good' stocks than it is to find the duds.
2231 2018-07-09 00:34:31 Technology stocks made solid gains as @AlibabaGroup surged 2.9%, @netflix advanced 2.5%, @facebook – whose chief Mark Zuckerberg has overtaken Warren Buffett as the world's third-richest person – climbed 2.4%, and @Microsoft and @Apple added 1.4%.
2232 2018-07-09 00:34:18 I'm afraid, if and when oil companies get pushed out by alternative energy, the economy will tank due to over investment in energy stocks. Many investment and retirement portfolios are heavily invested.

2237 2018-07-09 00:31:04 Cool article. My history in the stock market, I didn't do well until I stopped trading stocks, over 10 years ago. My forte is stocks under $10. Once I get 100% gains, I sell half and hope the rest runs on for years. That said I bought @snap sub $11 and just bought @ATT last week.
2238 2018-07-09 00:30:14 Considering that engineering team never left the fucking ground after Musk said they'd be leaving at 8 pm yesterday, it's pretty clear this js just a marketing stunt to buoy his stocks.
