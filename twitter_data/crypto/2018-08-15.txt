Hi, any movement / progress toward finding a new NZDT bank account for us Kiwi  customers?  I found the old system really cheap and easy to fund / withdrawal straight into local currency, BTC/NZD & NZD/BTC.  Are banks hiding behind privacy laws & red tape? Thanks

7 2018-08-15 23:57:16 For any new crypto traders like myself. When you feel yourself start to get emotional and frustrated. Tether out for a bit and walk away. Get your mind right, hit the gym, etc. come back refreshed. Emotional trading will liquidate you quick! Had to stop myself today from this.

LOL! if/when the game is ever up to barely being operable, they’re going to give us all a new title and pat themselves on the back and think they’ve fixed it all Once they’ve got our money they don’t give a fuck. We were foolish for thinking 2050 would be different

10 2018-08-15 23:57:06 I tried to watch the talk back from March with Roger, Jihan and CSW. CSW basically dominated the discussion with all these Ridiculous token ideas and I’m thinking to myself the whole time, this guy said he  was Satoshi Nakamoto, smh
