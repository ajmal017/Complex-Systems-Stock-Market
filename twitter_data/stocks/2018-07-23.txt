43 2018-07-23 23:30:39 The US dollar lifted again, and forex traders will look to today’s USD/CNY fix for further weakening of the yuan and towards 7.00 per US dollar. Tech stocks helped lift share markets and Google parent Alphabet reported strongly after the New York close @MicMcCarthy_CMC

62 2018-07-23 23:12:37 GAHHH! so many nice racks here at purdue. Studying stocks is actually very difficult for a tit man like myself here. Go skins.
63 2018-07-23 23:12:23 . @blueskiesatx  teach kitty how to trade stocks.. i showed her the basics but she needs more training
64 2018-07-23 23:11:26 Non justement dans ma Fnac ils vendaient vrm que des albums de VIXX, BigBang et SNSD, mais jamais aucun de BTS donc c juste une question de commande et le fait qu’ils veulent pas en commander si ils sont pas sur de vendre les stocks et préfère en faire à la demande
65 2018-07-23 23:08:29 I think this is true for genuine asset-based markets like stocks. Not true at all for currencies. Commodities - perhaps weakly so. Right now, I put crypto in the commodities category.
66 2018-07-23 23:07:01 Prefer stocks first then beheading. Abbot first in the q
67 2018-07-23 23:03:28 For long term retirement needs, 50% in cash and bonds is not balanced. Even Buffet says pretty much all your savings should be in stocks. Finance industry is a joke.
68 2018-07-23 23:03:03 was $390 a year ago. All stocks went up and $TSLA gone down. Once the decline starts it does not take 5 weeks  for it to go back to $25. Just be patient for a month or two you can again start loading at $25
69 2018-07-23 23:00:38 I just remembered I bought stocks back in 2008. I wonder what that investment looks like now .  To be continued...

72 2018-07-23 22:59:42 When searching for stocks, pay special attention to the industry. Positive trends in industries often produce winning stocks, not the other way around. Current top 5: Leisure/Movies, Medical Products, Computer Software, Retail, Internet
73 2018-07-23 22:59:01 no, if they weren't paying all their income to bankers and boomers they could save into other areas like stocks.
74 2018-07-23 22:58:41 This makes hella sense. One would think with the trade war and all, that stocks would be unsteady. They're using the tax cut money to do the buy backs, aren't they?

78 2018-07-23 22:52:26 It was a little crappy under $10 today. I got caught up in a few larger cap stocks and this was the only one I recorded. The concept is still the same with how I traded it.

85 2018-07-23 22:46:04 Had to do a LOT of melee getting here on this mission once I realized how low my stocks were. Not my preferred way of combat, since I like to soften up and thin out with the bow.

106 2018-07-23 22:22:30 I frequently order goods from China for personal use. The last time from ordering to delivery took just 6 days & that inc free postage. Yet we are meant to believe that food stocks will run out when supermarket distribution centres hold up to 4 weeks of dry stock? #Brexit

114 2018-07-23 22:16:20 This logic doesn't makes sense. If stock buybacks are going to cause stocks to fall huge after post earnings, why would companies bother to do stock buybacks?

121 2018-07-23 22:08:59 @FootLockerEU Can you tell me which FL stores stock Nike Air Jordan 3 Retro near Warrington pls? My 14 yr old son bought a size UK11 not realising he's actually UK12. I see you only refund by gift card & he wants those shoes, so we need to find one of your stores that stocks them
122 2018-07-23 22:08:50 I like to ask myself: What is the one stock I would own if I could only pick one and hold it for say five years... That's my #1 portfolio weighting. Then I proceed with what the two, three, four stocks I would pick etc... It forces the conviction level to surface. #investing
123 2018-07-23 22:05:55 Possibly, if you’re wanting to buy full stocks.

131 2018-07-23 21:58:32 No. Standard macro models include money because of its short run non-neutrality. Usually in several ways:  there are money in utility models, models with liquidity constraints, and models where more money stocks makes certain goods cheaper by minimizing transaction tome.
132 2018-07-23 21:58:10 The last 2 times Republicans did the same thing, all the corporate executives got bonuses, the big corporations did huge buy backs of stocks and everyone else got pennies, nothing at, or laid off.

135 2018-07-23 21:56:50 @pewdiepie said it, but there really should be stocks in memes. The amount of stuff I see reposted is insane. Say you came up with a meme and “invested” $5. Then thousands of people repost it and get “OC” credit for it. YOU SHOULD RECEIVE SOME SORT OF RECOGNITION/INCENTIVE.

Daming stocks paparating this week 
137 2018-07-23 21:54:27 Knock on effect from the winter / spring needed a good summer to rebuild forage stocks. With the current drought the situation for the coming winter is very serious for many farms as already eating into stocks. Time for a national strategy as I believe we’re facing a crisis
138 2018-07-23 21:54:17 It would seem to be a nice retirement fund to have access to that information. Just think of all the stocks you could buy with the information of who the government is going to raid and when. Is it listed as a benefit along with health insurance?
139 2018-07-23 21:53:56 Merci de votre retour. Une production en dessous des attentes mais la baisse est elle déjà chiffrée et en deçà des moyennes annuelles ? Baisse suffisante pour impacter significativement les stocks de report?
140 2018-07-23 21:52:01 And honestly we don't give a shit that your wages are down because our stocks are up up up :)
141 2018-07-23 21:51:00 Really one of the absolute classic tabloid headlines of all time.

"Stocks skid - Dow down 12."  Lol!  That was around a 1 1/2% drop then, equivalent to a 375 point drop now.  The Dow has gone up a lot more than the price of the News!
142 2018-07-23 21:50:39 That looks like a touch of investor capitulation to me. A good sign. Majority think this will never turn around, waited too long, fed up, too much red ink..and all the other wonderfully irrational human emotions. Cheap stocks at a time like this-perfect for me.
143 2018-07-23 21:50:31 I used to spend hours upon hours researching stocks/buying and selling on Robinhood. I had far less than $10K to play with, and the bulk of my gains came from their referral program.

Now I spend my time researching how to maximize my cash flow; the investments will come later.
144 2018-07-23 21:48:32 Market Close: MBS -25bps; DOW -13.83; NASDAQ +21.67; S&P 500 +5.15; 10yr Treasuries 2.96%; Stocks end in Mixed Territory, whiles Yields soar and push MBS lower (higher rates).

146 2018-07-23 21:45:14 $x typical one of these stocks that hump around on one leg sideways for MONTHS and MONTHS until sudden spike followed by a strong few day run.
147 2018-07-23 21:44:43 We've been working hard the last couple of months on something special. More to be announced tomorrow!

153 2018-07-23 21:40:05 With no end in sight to current drought isn’t it time for a national strategy to manage forage stocks to ensure continuity of milk , beef and lamb supplies.

155 2018-07-23 21:37:41 Amen, but first put them in stocks on the town square. Let the people mete out punishment. Hanging would be too kind.
156 2018-07-23 21:37:38 Anyone who knows anything about bump stocks knows that they are NOT the problem and making them illegal will do NOTHING! this is just a way for leftists to do what they want,  an entire gun grab in the USA.

159 2018-07-23 21:35:59 BULL MARKET RETRACEMENTS are usually 14.5% in the best stocks.  
$NFLX  top @ 423.21.
Retracement,14.5%: takes us to 361.46, which is almost exactly where it is today, 361.05. if support at 361,.05  If support holds (around 361.05), then we'll have another leg up.

174 2018-07-23 21:20:02 Ce qui me fait peur c'est les stocks...
175 2018-07-23 21:19:56 Mortgages force homeowners to save & invest more than they would otherwise. You can argue that renters could just invest the remainder of their income in stocks/index funds/etfs/reits but in practice they don’t. People need financial education.
176 2018-07-23 21:19:44 Plus a call to bring back the stocks as an afterthought
177 2018-07-23 21:17:58 Why? Employer's almost universally care more about the bottom line than their workers. If it's legal to pay them less, they simply will. If they get more money from tax breaks they just keep it and buy back stocks.  Sure it's their fault but its being enabled by ^^^ all this^^^^

190 2018-07-23 21:11:04 IMHO, traders know that $URA operates as a lever on #Uranium #stocks.  Day by day they walk down $URA NAV on low volume which triggers higher volume selling by Global X of its $URA held equities. Creates negative feedback loop, as others see that as signal to sell more $URA 
191 2018-07-23 21:10:59 Google's parent, Alphabet, beat expectations setting up a big jump in tech stocks on Tuesday. The company was recently fined a whopping $5.1 billion by EU regulators.

Some names set up nicely to go higher, e.g., $GOOS $SNAP $OKTA $FSCT $MDB $EVBG. Generally many stocks just grind higher on low volume.

249 2018-07-23 20:38:54 Most financial stocks are following this wedge pattern, and they are breaking the resistance the same time the $SPX is breaking out the 6 month consolidation. As well as that, when the yield curve flattens like it is doing, financial and aggressive stocks tend to over perform.
250 2018-07-23 20:38:53 I don't watch tv news. That crap (and newsweek) is for idiots that need their opinions regurgitated back to them.

321 2018-07-23 20:00:29 Yes, I undersand. The higher volume stocks tend to have options w/o such a wide spread, so I figured it was a function of being HAS vs. say, a LULU or AAPL. The reward on options is such a high percentage, can be worth it, but if wrong, stopping out can be difficult, too.
322 2018-07-23 20:00:08 So, stocks rise as interest rates rise. Not a good sign for individuals with credit card and Adjustable Rate Mortgages.

379 2018-07-23 19:21:58 Not obvious - correlations are a moveable feast.  Gold could go either way. Higher growth/inflation leading to higher rates & stronger dollar would be a drag on Gold but if the implied additional FED tightening causes stocks to sell off then Gold may benefit from safe haven flows

381 2018-07-23 19:19:28 Understand where you are coming from for this, but I don’t think in this instance (if/when if happens) it’s one to press the panic button for. Certainly worth a question to the providers involved though

388 2018-07-23 19:15:49 Some stocks matter. Others do not. 
Of the pre mrkt reporting companies today 12 stocks are lower (many from 5-12% including HAL, CADE, NTGR, ITW) and 4 are higher. They don't matter bcs they don't derive the indexes like the fav 5-7 do.

394 2018-07-23 19:12:01 Corn:Created a binary system (yes/no) to mimic traders of ending stocks with signals near USDA reports. Since 2016 there was barely a gain. Biz cycle model was far superior. ES is just a clue.
395 2018-07-23 19:11:56 Mortgage Bonds hover near session lows while Stocks trade with meager gains.
396 2018-07-23 19:11:48 At midday, Mortgage Bond prices are lower. Stocks clinging to meager gains. 10-yr yield rises to 2.95% from this morning's low of 2.88%.

403 2018-07-23 19:06:35 Tax cuts don't help becuase, with the exception of Medical taxes and such...most taxes are taken AFTER wages. All it does is increase corporate Dividends. Which, generally, are used to pay out stocks, or saved until later.
404 2018-07-23 19:06:03 I'm not a financial guy though. I just pay close attention and ive spent my life trying to understand human behavior. Stocks seem more emotional to me than hard numbers.

I should play them more but I don't have any money to take the risk. Trying to save up. Student loans etc.
405 2018-07-23 19:05:45 I enjoy your writing Antonio (eg. the Wired article about the #SiliconValley caste system). But nothing any writer does is going to change our inevitable future.

409 2018-07-23 19:03:21 Your first description is more clear. Use risk free rates to value liability, then over collateralize to secure benefit if the sponsor is weak and/or pension assets are not matched to liabilities (e.g. invested in stocks).

411 2018-07-23 19:02:35 So if it did raise that much in that amount of time I would look into the cause more and make sure the stocks you're invested in are stable.

Bc my personal opinion is this is being inflated based on name and emotions on wall street. Perhaps buy backs as well. But not sustainable
412 2018-07-23 19:02:16 I’m constantly seeing people sell packs with stocks, sponsor logos, org logos, flares, basically all stuff you can find free online. It’s pretty ridiculous.

432 2018-07-23 18:51:44 2017 is still obamas economy, nothing trump did could have effected that. The tarriffs trump is putting in place in 2018 are going to slow down the u.s. economy. All the tax cuts did was help companies buyback stocks. Great economy doesnt always mean great for the worker hence

453 2018-07-23 18:38:46 At midday, Mortgage Bond prices are lower. Stocks clinging to meager gains. 10-yr yield rises to 2.95% from this morning's low of 2.88%.
454 2018-07-23 18:38:04 I'm still not sure how a 2% increase would net someone 30k. I assume it has to be based on stocks and you have an aggressive portfolio. (Which can work against you if the market goes south) it seems like a lot in a short amount of time.
455 2018-07-23 18:37:51 In other words 18,943.00 = $1,894.30 a year or $39.50 a week gross. Also.

497 2018-07-23 18:15:28 All assault weapons should be banned  & for all civilians together with bump stocks & magazines of more than 5 bullets.
498 2018-07-23 18:15:25 Absolutely. Decades ago, stocks going up meant vaguely that blue collars & Main St workers might get a bump. But not for a long time now. It's a metric that mocks far more people than it's useful to. & never more than now is it true that you NEED money to MAKE money.

Many stocks with good momentum crosses big OI strikes easily. 

How to improve this analysis for stocks?

641 2018-07-23 17:01:24 You’re blanket statement isn’t factual- it’s just a blanket statement. Being diversified in your portfolio is the best method and homeownership is a balanced method- most of us have stocks, bonds, money market and a home and got in at a low APR and have paid down the loan- 1/2
642 2018-07-23 17:01:05 Thanks for the 9c $HIP warrants.  And remind your broker when he is shorting to use the correct 80% volatility rate to find fair value and not 50% which is traditionally applied to bank stocks.  #wrongalgo $1.00 strike price and 5 years time value, see what that gets you.
643 2018-07-23 17:00:06 Stock drop: $PZZA and 4 other stocks drop. The Common Wealth is investigating! Reach out for more info. TheCommonWealth.mail@gmail.com #StockDrop #PZZA
644 2018-07-23 16:59:39 I prefer the pillory and stocks. Plus, that gives us a use for all the fruit 'n' veg going to waste with no undocumented workers to pick them.
645 2018-07-23 16:59:08 Stocks open lower, but the losses are contained ... Dow -22 points.
646 2018-07-23 16:56:39 Rather than worry about weed I’d be more concerned with the fact Middle Level Nav paid a fortune to build otter holts- which in turn have now decimated fish stocks. Morons.
647 2018-07-23 16:56:31 Think of the fish stocks
648 2018-07-23 16:56:08 Shorting stocks is not their strong suit.
649 2018-07-23 16:55:38 It all comes down to money.  Deregulate environmental laws, attack science based climate change all for short term financial gain for the energy conglomerates and market.  The value of stocks would go down, loss of possible trillions of dollars if green energy is allowed to grow.

651 2018-07-23 16:51:53 I'm a fan of stock index funds, but I'd allocate more to international and I'd be leery of going 100% stocks. Even a modest allocation to bonds can notably reduce a portfolio's volatility without much hit to long-term returns, thanks to the return bonus from regular rebalancing.

670 2018-07-23 16:37:49 The plan wasn't to "pay down the debt" it was to reduce the annual deficit so the stock of debt didn't increase to unsustainable levels. Don't confuse stocks and flows even to make good rhetorical shots at a bad government.
671 2018-07-23 16:36:34 Deepak ji how are these stocks looking from here on? Pls advise
672 2018-07-23 16:36:29 No Gold stock play for now - the strength of USD presents a lot of head wind for gold stocks - trying to time the bottom is not a wise move. Watching Pot stocks carefully for now - no positions. At this every moment I am 100% in cash. Markets in summer are very choppy. Cheers.
673 2018-07-23 16:36:24 Just like realizing a loss (in stocks) hurts more than the benefit of realizing a gain! Regardless, I am still watching sports!

680 2018-07-23 16:31:50 Problem is that people who down even own stocks, majority of Trump supporters, still use the stock market as the only gauge to measure the economy.
681 2018-07-23 16:31:05 Completely agree! His behaviour is unhinged and erratic.  I wouldn't trust him to manage a cactus!
Voters, please! You have a chance to right this wrong at the November polls! Your blue chip stocks will mean nothing if the world you know today no longer exists!
682 2018-07-23 16:30:42 Stop losses can force you into a pattern of buy high, sell low, especially when they are not set to accommodate the high volatility of individual stocks in the market. I know ppl that set them at 10% loss or so. That’s crazy!
683 2018-07-23 16:29:58 Don't lecture me on food stocks. I'm fully aware. I'm a remainer but don't like the way FBPE bods attack JC continually. If they want to protest, protest against the tories, whose whole idea Brexit was.

691 2018-07-23 16:25:28 Good mental investment exercise. I don't own any individual stocks and it proves to me why! Will own etf for bal life but no clue which stocks for 25 years. My thinking is innovation will make many winners today losers in 15+ years. Take a needs to eat and value shot: chipotle
692 2018-07-23 16:25:15 Those 3 aren't getting any younger. Why stay the same? Why keep coming up short?  Go all-in for a title.  Young players are unpredictable. You never know how long it will take for them to develop into winners.  Follow BOS's lead. They went for it. Traded youth for proven talent.

697 2018-07-23 16:22:25 @pschiller It would be great if the Apple Stocks app offered a P/FCF ratio.

702 2018-07-23 16:21:51 And? Is that illegal? I hold energy stocks and I supported Trump. Am I colluding?

This whole Russian influence narrative is a joke. China is a far worse actor because of their economic strength & mercantilism, & many countries in the Mideast (for ex Qatar) fund US think tanks.

767 2018-07-23 15:51:23 @AOTtrades I think based on how the remaining FAANG stocks report this week is going to dictate QQQ direction.  The smart thing is probably to wait until after reporting is done to commit to a market direction at least in tech

828 2018-07-23 15:14:22 Stocks aren't lottery. Each stock is a company. And so, if you invest in stocks of good companies you're highly likely to profit and if you invest in stocks of bad companies you'll lose money. It is pretty simple.

1023 2018-07-23 14:03:12 @ReignOfApril It’s not about him being President at all! It’s about the tons of free advertising Twitter is getting from him. If Twitter stocks were down in 2015, they certainly are skyrocketing now cause of him! Twitter is not blocking jack squat! 
1024 2018-07-23 14:02:33 True!! Pero im gonna look into other couriers like sonic express and abest usually when i order stocks that originates in provinces they use those couriers 
1025 2018-07-23 14:02:04 Any chance he will be loaned out or does it look like he can push for the starting line up? Aus attacking/midfield stocks for the next 5-10 years look seriously good
1026 2018-07-23 14:01:55 Libel? He is no longer employed. He advocates the overthrow of our duly elected president. He is a Communist and Muslim. He should be in the stocks in a county square.
1027 2018-07-23 14:01:43 #Paypal reports earnings on Wednesday 25th and analysts are expecting revenues of $3.8bn with earnings around $0.55 per share. With the stock up 20% this year and sitting at an all time high, I don’t think the stock offers very good risk-reward at these prices. #stocks #investing

1108 2018-07-23 13:25:07 Macro economics is good for short term insight into the general market. Since 3 out of 4 stocks follow the general market it can affect entries and exits.

1153 2018-07-23 13:00:41 What's hilarious is that the best the left can offer in response to #walkAway is to cry "Russian bots".  In doing so they make themselves laughing stocks and help conservatives.
1154 2018-07-23 12:59:45 If investors live by "buy the rumor, sell the news," consider why, with all the rumors zipping by, there hasn't been a sustainable run yet.

Not being a buzzkill, just being cautious.

1166 2018-07-23 12:53:06 Few investors are independent decision-makers; most delegate to agents. The weight of this smaller group is amplified.

It is possible to find stocks for which only a few agents determine the price. With these, the price will behave more like a #superposition than a distribution.
1167 2018-07-23 12:52:52 Most of the growth for nifty in the last year has come from a limited number of stocks. Check the % of your holdings in these stocks vs the low performing ones.
1168 2018-07-23 12:51:43 Many had exited their investments due to the index fall earlier and sitting with the losses n cash aiming to recover the losses via trading..while nifty had silently recovered and nearing all time high.. probably they must b waiting fr the stocks to hit new highs to re-enter
1169 2018-07-23 12:49:41 As the Nifty fights all kinds of headwinds to approach new highs, I see select midcaps overcoming the odds posed by ASM/Reclassification of stocks by SEBI et al - and making serious up moves, consensus bearishness and "flight to safety" thoughts notwithstanding @CNBCTV18Live
1170 2018-07-23 12:49:26 Remember the whole "stocks are the new bonds" thing? Guess that meant they barely move in price and only in response to irrelevant macro stuff.

1178 2018-07-23 12:46:18 Yes, I see it that way. You just need to compare your mortgage cost vs. the income from your savings (flows) to decide  what to do. But debt and savings are just stocks which should net out on your personal wealth book. Does it make sense?

1391 2018-07-23 09:49:33 Shorting stocks should not even be a legal option. It induces/promotes malicious behaviour.

Not at all. Even if 6 on 10 are correct you can end up earning serious money because in the 4 stocks you can atmost lose your investment while in the 6 winning ones there is no limit to gains.

Politicians, seeking to rig stocks and skim, assure KINGPINS they are immune to prosecution.  2 CLINTON Judges magically get the cases and LIE ON THE RECORD.  Lawless. !

1889 2018-07-23 01:58:02 Global Cues: US Stocks Close Slightly Changed On Friday
1890 2018-07-23 01:46:34 I'm a B+ American at most.  I was delayed a few weeks back at DFW and was speaking to Aman on my flight. He stated that we are a capitalist country and if a person doesn't know about stocks, trade, etc they're a D- American. I agree. Have to know the basics at least.
1891 2018-07-23 01:46:23 Consumer driven. If you use Amazon, you're also making its stocks go up.

1893 2018-07-23 01:45:12 well since absolutely nobody asked, I feel compelled to point out that Oswald’s love language is giving gifts. he sends Ed a sweater in Arkham, gives him a puzzle box, completely stocks his wardrobe. Ed’s love language is acts of service. exhibit a: “I would do anything for you”
1894 2018-07-23 01:43:35 kya vivek ji..u missed the difference between quality and satta stocks while comparing nifty vs karachi index to prove something against modi n bjp.its like comparing RIL with PC jwelers...do u thing their is any kind of comparison.
1895 2018-07-23 01:42:46 @HappinessInHD I just found new information about the release of Fortnite android. It said the teaser was gonna for PC and android and it will be run by tencent. Since they own around 50% precent of the stocks.
1896 2018-07-23 01:41:20 I got you and agree 100%.  There are so many sector catalysts coming that will push the stocks independent of their management, resources and all other factors.  Those with all the goods will really do well.  Right on the money!

1900 2018-07-23 01:37:49 Small mii brawler was the only busted mii. Everyone just passes them off as all busted and move on. Yet we allow, Zss, bayo, MK ect play knowing they have the abilities to take away stocks in a heart beat. Hell mii gunner and sword fight are straight up garbo..
1901 2018-07-23 01:37:47 Join is those coming Friday for mods, Spartan stocks, street stocks, pony stocks, and bandoleros.
1902 2018-07-23 01:37:33 The dollar declined against major currencies to its lowest in more than two weeks after Trump criticized the Fed‘s tightening policy, while stocks slipped on fears of further trade protectionist measures
1903 2018-07-23 01:35:49 Yes, I always think if trouble with lowest unemployment since 1969 and record high stocks and the more money I have in my pocket, it is real trouble.  #dramamuch #wakeup #walkaway
1904 2018-07-23 01:33:16 Why didn’t anybody tel me that if I have a yuge tax cut to the wealthy &corporations the deficit would speed towards $1trillion next year? And why did t they tel me the corporations would just buy back stocks? Why didn’t anybody tell me a trade war with China would harm farmers?
1905 2018-07-23 01:32:39 Parianas @_machiparu_ Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
1906 2018-07-23 01:24:49 #WalMart is a terrible employer they don’t pay their associates a living wage. Their stores always have many empty shelves or called Out Of Stocks, their health care is only a catastrophic policy, there is zero customer service, they also manage with negativity WM Sucks.
1907 2018-07-23 01:23:27 I am hoping money flees to precious metals and crypto. Sell my PMs at the top and pick up all those cheap stocks and real estate.
1908 2018-07-23 01:23:18 It’s crazy how Im making more than what my job pays me in 2 week with one week in stocks. Love my business. 
1909 2018-07-23 01:22:47 Josiah has a mini fridge in our room and he always fully stocks it with ice cold water and my goodness it's the old basic bitch wife ass dream I love it so v much
1910 2018-07-23 01:22:26 Dealing Stocks is like dealing Drugs, watching Wolf Of Wall Street just make me clock that.
1911 2018-07-23 01:18:43 I used to pay for people’s food pay for their movie tickets and drive them all around never asking for gas money and they’d still give me the cold shoulder. Well that’s over now, I spent all my money on whale stocks and I’m fricken broke. Nobody told me that Krill were dishonest.
1912 2018-07-23 01:18:27 So, Trump doesn't take credit for the surge in stock prices, but when they go down a little bit, he is to blame? Aren't stocks up overall under his Presidency? #Dishonest
1913 2018-07-23 01:18:00 I see some people use the same process year round and say the market is this or that, I see others trade the same stocks and say the market is this or that, the market is not the issue, the market is dynamic always has been and always will be, your static approach is the issue
1914 2018-07-23 01:17:11 Usyk dips, stocks slip on Trump remarks
1915 2018-07-23 01:14:21 Investing in them stocks tho 
1916 2018-07-23 01:13:58 Once I am "in the market zone" and know what the movers had done over the last day I find it easy to see trades based on that prior movement. Whereas with stocks I might look for that in charts, with crypto I find an active stalker approach works better for me

1920 2018-07-23 01:11:22 My rules & experience. I trade crypto different to stocks and I enjoy the tech analysis but when they run I use a go with the flow approach and just get in the rhythm with pilot buys & sells until I am in the flow. Of a 72 hour trade bender I might take 12 hours to find that flow

1925 2018-07-23 01:07:08 I would like to ask what is “sensible gun control”? Getting rid of bump stocks and the so called “assault weapons” will not stop gun violence. The crying libs will never take away the #2A or our guns.
1926 2018-07-23 01:06:20 since I started endorcing rost as of august of later year at 22.5 now it july and is at 83.7 the last I checked but one day all my stocks are up I my have revinue on thegame the does the same to the tune of nearly 5 trillion every six month I trying to figure how start small 2 it

1936 2018-07-23 00:54:53 Exactly! What you just stated is precisely my humble point. 
Youngsters did fine in some years, and not in others, in some asset classes, but not in others. The principle of time, aka compounding, has been falsely applied to stocks.
1937 2018-07-23 00:54:37 mostly stocks & bonds. sure as hell wasn't farming! lol
1938 2018-07-23 00:53:13 was sold on xrp and potential.  Had no intention to sell all of it or anytime soon.  Had traded successfully stocks based on fundamentals.  Held xrp with heavy investment till watched it drop to -60%. Other -30 % trying to recover in desperation. Then started learning TA
1939 2018-07-23 00:52:08 lmao I love that this is something Wayfair actually stocks.
1940 2018-07-23 00:52:07 Management and board compensation should be a mixture of bonds and stocks, and a lock up period should be many years.
1941 2018-07-23 00:50:27 This makes me in favor of bringing back the stocks as punishment. I’ll be first in line to whip a rotten tomato into this guy’s grill.
1942 2018-07-23 00:47:56 European shares fell on Friday as earnings updates disappointed, with auto stocks bearing the brunt of trade tensions – @Daimler and @Peugeot sank 2.4%, @Volkswagen lost 2.3% and @Renault slid 1.2%.
1943 2018-07-23 00:47:42 No comparison exists between trading stocks and individual sports. The Market Mskers in stock trading are unscrupulous thieves. No such degenerate can be found in tennis or golf. If you lose a tournament it is because someone played better. Not someone screwed you.
1944 2018-07-23 00:47:40 Elsewhere, the larger financial stocks saw gains as JP Morgan climbed 1.3%, Bank of America jumped 1.5%, Goldman Sachs rose 0.9% and Morgan Stanley added 0.8%, while biotechs AbbVie slid 0.9%, Amgen lost 0.7% and Celgene dipped 0.3%.

1947 2018-07-23 00:45:59 US stocks ended slightly lower on Friday as escalating trade anxieties driven by President Donald Trump offset a string of robust earnings results
1948 2018-07-23 00:43:56 This alone proves to me how far disconnected you are on this topic. You shouldn't speak on behalf of people you cannot relate to and very clearly don't even know or have taken the time to get to know. FYI, same people are allowed to buy OTC pinksheet stocks.

1952 2018-07-23 00:42:44 Again you are using an analytical approach to push dreamy and dangerous non-analysis. Youngsters shall NOT do fine if they invest in bubbles, or dotcoms, or oil stocks near all time highs. Nor did the  youngster who started investing in the 1920 and retired in 1955.

1955 2018-07-23 00:42:26 Also the $9 billion surplus was part of the $13 billion surplus he inherited. So he blew $4 billion on a year. Then posted nothing but deficits until 2014. Then he sold our GM stocks for $3 billion to create a false surplus. It is interesting the bias in this article is half true

1962 2018-07-23 00:39:06 Actually, it helps all the people who have retirement plans (eg 401k, IRA) and regular accounts invested in stocks and stock indexes. That is a large swath of the middle class. When companies buy back stock the prices of their shares go up and they can increase dividends as well.

1964 2018-07-23 00:37:07 Ok just imagine: in Ultimate, in your first 50 or so matches right after one player loses all their stocks, a new character appears as a CPU and the remaining player has to beat them to unlock them.  If it's time mode it goes to "sudden death" against the CPU
1965 2018-07-23 00:35:46 They are investing in the network, not in a company is a protocol, people are free to invest on whatever they want, betting in Las Vegas, trading options, stocks, cryptocurrencies, futures, buying lottery tickets
1966 2018-07-23 00:35:39 International lentil markets finished the week's trading on a weaker note as selling interest in both spot and new crop shipping positions.
Yields may need to drop more than 30% below last year to reduce supplies to levels which may result in a stocks to use ratio under 10%.
1967 2018-07-23 00:35:12 The economy is stronger for those of us in business, for those of us who have 401ks and stocks, for those of us who pay taxes, for those of us concerned about our children’s future and job prospects. And then there are the dolts who said no, ignorance must be bliss.
1968 2018-07-23 00:34:12 Gotta ask, how much of your net worth is tied to this one trade. Seems like a lot of effort. I strictly index and don’t touch individual stocks no matter what.
1969 2018-07-23 00:29:31 Bonds: Global bond market risk increased to 26% (last week: 17%).

FX: Our US Dollar risk index remains at one of the lowest reading (8%) since January 2016.

1976 2018-07-23 00:21:40 Today one of my coworkers was refilling the stocks of cup, lids and such. He asked me if I needed anything and without a second thought I responded with ‘a will to live’ and he just gave me a hug and a pat on the back bc he couldn’t tell if I was serious or joking xD
1977 2018-07-23 00:20:28 i was trying to think of a wrong situation and i had this vision in which we're chorally singing the coup's "the guillotine" in the hours after the revolution ends an we're leading a bunch of GS execs down to the stocks and honestly my day just got 30x better
1978 2018-07-23 00:19:38 Because in most cases the CEO picks the board, picks or is the Chairman, and gets huge portion of compensation in stocks &options, incentivizing CEO to maximize share price for self and major shareholders at expense of other stakeholders (employees included)

1980 2018-07-23 00:18:45 MultiFund Structure takes care of that
There are 4 Funds
Fund I which has highest exposure to stock is optional 
The exposure to stock also reduces has you grow older and move from Fund II to III.
For Fund IV, the retiree fund, PFAs can even decide not to invest in stocks at all.
1981 2018-07-23 00:14:59 I'm not talking about taking guns from people who can pass stringent background checks. I do NOT believe citizens should have rapid-firing assault weapons or bump stocks, etc. Nor arsenals. But a gun for personal protection would be acceptable.
1982 2018-07-23 00:14:52 Then again the armistice in 1953...the South never signed a peace agreement and still to this day no progress has been made.  And is there any desire to?  Defense stocks are still great assets to own.
1983 2018-07-23 00:14:35 Man the simple stuff is huge! 

- What is interest?
- How does credit work?
- What happens when you borrow money?
- What’s the difference between stocks and bonds? 

Doesn’t take much to spark the fire.

1985 2018-07-23 00:13:12 3 days food stocks (assuming no panic buying depleting them prior), and rule of thumb from war zones is civil unrest starts after 9 missed meals. Rioting by 5th April, martial law by 8th, AND NO WAY TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY. And this is success?
1986 2018-07-23 00:10:00 @ShimmerCatMan I’m just not sure how anyone can defend Stocks at this point. As I’ve said before, the Sky have too much talent to be this awful. And when they lose, they’re not competitive, which is BAD
1987 2018-07-23 00:08:44 I do stocks lol
1988 2018-07-23 00:06:44 The magic ingridents in trading patience n not to trade a lot. Wait for dip on qualtity stocks n hold a little longer...
1989 2018-07-23 00:06:42 It's basically instead of buying promotional products and such with building the collection. Build your collection by just speculation on single cards that are powerful and cheap and move them later at hype. (magic but stocks kinda)
1990 2018-07-23 00:04:27 I would put everything into bitconnect and say yes. Then go back to trading stocks 
1991 2018-07-23 00:03:14 Pero talaga wala kaming stocks ng pagkain dito
1992 2018-07-23 00:01:53 Yep, that's where we differ, I truly believe he's for improving all Americans lives. Funny thing about the economy related issues, as stocks climbed to historic highs the antis were "thanks Obama", when they dipped, "see what trump did," they rise again "thanks o"
