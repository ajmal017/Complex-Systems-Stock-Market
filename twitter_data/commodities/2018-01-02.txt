55 2018-01-02 21:07:48 I am super curious how the Conservative government is going to manipulate world oil prices to ensure Canada's oil industry never ever ever experiences any downturns that sort of comes with the territory with natural resource commodities.

71 2018-01-02 20:03:25 For real, basic commodities should be actually tax free
72 2018-01-02 20:00:02 That's the whole point-its a spec market-not a shareholder or a hedge against physical commodities mkt-just buy and sell perceived value-until  cryptos go mainstream
73 2018-01-02 19:51:39 Yes our dollar is low but how can u compare the price of commodities being high ... with free health care? would rather pay more for a book than not be able to afford medicine
74 2018-01-02 19:48:36 This does not negate the fact that wage-labor is implicitly an unequal exchange of a fixed amount of labor for wages that are barely sufficient for survival, and certainly not equal to the commodities produced by the laborer.

80 2018-01-02 19:43:36 Seeing the world wholly in terms of this dualism - the linked imperatives to produce and consume commodities - people are mystified as to the nature of the underlying social relations that produces these imperatives, in a manner analogous to primitive religious production.
81 2018-01-02 19:42:10 In such a society, people are confronted with the survival imperative of acquiring enough value to exchange for subsistence.   Their only possession being their labor, this is by implication an imperative to help produce commodities.
82 2018-01-02 19:40:40 On the contrary.  The wage labor system is premised on the idea that the wealth of a society in which capitalist production prevails is in the form of commodities, the individual unit of which is the commodity.

90 2018-01-02 19:00:28 It's a flight-to-security asset, too. But oil & gas are going away as major commodities, & there's multiple, huge operations planning to mine asteroids - which blows out the value of rare metals.
91 2018-01-02 18:56:39 Yes and Russia is one of the cheapest if not cheapest markets based on CAPE. Massive negative sentiment towards Russia, everyone who was going to sell has sold (who is left), and commodities (Russia's main exports) are entering a bull market. Do they ring bells at the bottom?

130 2018-01-02 17:21:29 I share your despair, anger and bewilderment that animals are treated so cruelly and shabbily. Those who do should think shame, but so many seem to see animals as no more than commodities, lesser beings, for humans to exploit and treat as they will.

132 2018-01-02 17:17:45 Fund flows pour in to commodities pushing sugar up to producer pricing territory - volume picking up - growers and millers having a Happy New Year
133 2018-01-02 17:17:02 Yes i’ve been quite suprised especially gold .. i’m a long term bull but with equities doing so well i expected gold to tread water.. its all about the dollar if it fights back then commodities & metals could pullback
134 2018-01-02 17:14:42 also note the move from commodities to manufacturing to pure tech. You can see the same progression in other places get stalled for one simple reason - education. Education is what drives the movement to high GDP areas.
135 2018-01-02 17:13:35 “Idk .... I think we’re both really hot commodities”. @Radthegoat, you’re right lol
136 2018-01-02 17:12:02 No they aren’t commodities either . It’s the pro abortion lobby who want to treat babies as commodities to be killed for any reason whatsoever

138 2018-01-02 17:09:31 Las nuevas aceiteras generan escasa mano de obra porque están totalmente automatizadas. La soja se separa en aceite y harina y luego se vuelve a exportar como commodities. El valor agregado sería se convierte en carnes (avícola, porcina, bovina) huevos o leche.

The tax we pay on commodities are not tax?
These have been taken from each and every citizen i am not talking about the direct taxes like those from feudals and billionaire bussiness man
144 2018-01-02 16:54:22 Thanks. Agreed, ironically, Bitcoin's first-generation distributed ledger technology limitations arguably make it attractive as a store of value versus other crypto-commodities. Still it is clear we are in an early phase  - more to come! : )

150 2018-01-02 16:29:12 Primero mintieron que gracias al M.A.S. los precios de las commodities subieron. Ahora que bajaron bastante dicen que es gracias al consumo interno que la economia crece. Somos menos de 3 millones de asalariados legales - no hay consumo interno que valga.
151 2018-01-02 16:28:59 Seems like a lot of commodities hitting new highs. Inflation could be the surprise story of 2018.
152 2018-01-02 16:26:50 De acuerdo. Le comento mi posiciómn frente a la propuesta económica der Petro. 1. Petro tiene razón en decir que no podemos llamar "proceso productivo" a la extracción de materias primas. Pero tampoco el producir materias primas y commodities del agro. (1)

156 2018-01-02 16:16:29 In the US cryptos are commodities, not securities... Once cleared you hold them as a "thing", not attached to the seller anymore ( i.e: seller not an "issuer"). In some countries they don't even have a status!

160 2018-01-02 15:45:26 I think nike is still selling commodities overall compared to more luxury products. That said, the missing context in the article is that probably 90% of products in the world are commodities so Amazon has plenty of runway to eat.

162 2018-01-02 15:39:21 Capital Gains tax/transaction tax applicable on commodities trading in India should be applicable on bitcoin as well. Already Indian govt has issued IT notices to individuals with high trading volumes in Bitcoin, which is logical course of action.

164 2018-01-02 15:30:04 I think this should have been studied longer. If the prices of the gasoline will increase, then the prices of the commodities will surely increase as well. Pinakatatamaan na naman ang masa na kakarampot ang panggastos. Ngayong magmamahal ang bilihin, kakaunti ang mabibili.
165 2018-01-02 15:27:22 Imagine my friend those with a p100k annual income gets a lower tax. And the worse basic commodities increases. How about us below poverty?
166 2018-01-02 15:21:32 i don’t know if TRAiN will really benefit us all.  While personal income taxes will decrease and thereby increase take home pays, it also increases excise tax on gasoline and eventually will increase prices of commodities.i think it is superficially beneficial but let’s see
167 2018-01-02 15:19:48 True, but that means 100% of the time in market. Regarding bear market I have no faith in my systems until I have traded thru one. Most commodities where not electronic before 2008 so not a lot of relevant data to play around with.

173 2018-01-02 15:04:57 But, I also would suggest we keep an eye on coffee futures, cuz if commodities does bust out, coffee prices will cut into earnings & put pressure on the multiple. Pull up correlation chart also & you'll see between the two. Hopefully helpful   #BeFuckingAwesome

182 2018-01-02 14:32:06 I didn't say "wheat and corn". I said the commodity sector. That's a broad basket of commodities. That doesn't mean every commodity within that basket sees the same result.

188 2018-01-02 14:07:39 Now, the other uglier side: The rest of the world is competing as  aggressively as the US and we're at least as addicted to fuel and commodities as every other major state actor (i.e., The Oligarchs).  People  don't seem to matter except in a nebulous way as consumers.

199 2018-01-02 13:31:42 Of course all value is subjective, but certainly there are things with intrinsic value, such as real estate and commodities. I challenge the value of bitcoin because it is not being used as a currency in the mainstream and is unlikely to unseat fiat currency in the future.

222 2018-01-02 11:50:54 And once you start 'using' humans as commodities in this way, the question arises: WHO is using them? What are people FOR? Whom do they serve?

In our liberal world, people belong only to themselves. The likes of Young don't like that. At all.
223 2018-01-02 11:50:15 Cheaper commodities translates to more demand in both import/exports. More demand requires bigger workforce. Hence more jobs, more tax revenue. It's a win win situation. And btw you will still require inland road transport. Thus diverted NOT eliminated.
224 2018-01-02 11:38:45 Don't just look at one side of the coin. Jobs only. Look on the other side, prices of commodities, they will be lower. I am totally with the president on this one.

228 2018-01-02 11:24:06 Saving bank deposits on aggregate level can lead to a liquidity crisis. I think R.Wray said something like: all ‘money’ can buy commodities and all commodities attempt to buy money.

246 2018-01-02 08:44:58 Wealthy norms forcing poor micros to shine their shoes, lest they be turned into insole inserts. Micro workers being forced to build electronics or do special work that is too difficult for norm hands, lest they end up commodities themselves. And so on.

248 2018-01-02 08:01:50 Materials, Energy, Gold seem like the likely winners coming out of the gate in 2018. Inflation Risk. Weak Dollar Risk. Deficits Risk. GeoPolitical Risk make commodities strong the 1st Quarter.
249 2018-01-02 08:00:09 What u just said, American officials have been lying 2 American public about the amount we produce. Oil is sold on the Commodities Market. Many factors will/can affect price per barrel of crude oil. Koch brothers manipulated price in 2012.
250 2018-01-02 07:59:11 Modi must act on war footing against alarming unemployment problem,unchecked growing prices of essential commodities and  rapid increase in economic inequality during the last three years.
251 2018-01-02 07:54:04 plz keep daily consumable commodities such as LPG away from Transactional Charges on Cashless Transactions to promote this campaign.
Rs 5 are given as discount but Rs 7 are deducted as TXN Charges.
Thanks.....Jai Maa Bharti

263 2018-01-02 06:24:59 As Irish potato prices were fixed with Government authorities intervention, all other commodities (Banana, vegetables,...) also need  such assistance. And this price setting could always consider production costs including farmers works values. These all will encourage youth.
264 2018-01-02 06:10:43 A few PMIs this morning to start the year off in smash’n’grab style. 

DXY very heavy and a lot of good value in Scandies v both EUR and USD. 

Commodities bid to old boots.
265 2018-01-02 06:06:56 $EUR new highs 1.20805 - I don't really care much for it specifically but everyone watches the $DXY for their "U.S. Dollar" sentiment, *which is too much Euro! ...That being said USD melting which means #Metals like #Gold $GC_F & other #commodities going to go north my friends...
266 2018-01-02 06:03:24 "inflation" alert: RBA releases #Commodities prices for #Australia- down 5.9%

Previous month revised lower from -3.3% to -4% - stark difference from double-digit gains when #China wasn't tightening the belt.
267 2018-01-02 06:00:02 #Gold and #silver, like other #commodities, have an intrinsic value, which is not arbitrary, but is dependent on their scarcity.
268 2018-01-02 05:44:02 This US cold blast is pretty crazy. Florida may even get some of the freezing temperatures. US natgas futures up as much as 5% at one point today so far #commodities #weather #winter

276 2018-01-02 04:53:01 Commodities: Moving higher, but they won’t fly too close to the sun just yet#Forex
277 2018-01-02 04:42:04 When public commodities are left in the gutters, affordability and priority becomes a concern. Most state financed clubs in M'sia are incompetent in generating revenue.
278 2018-01-02 04:39:47 O darbari tax doesn't mean you should have a big  bussiness and you give tax and have tax returns and ntn  number there is also an indirect tax gst  sale tax 
See the actual prices on the commodities you buy from the market .
279 2018-01-02 04:37:59 Exactly.  And at that point no one will pay off a dollar loan in commodities when they can satisfy the loan in worthless dollars. That’s what a carry trade is all about.
280 2018-01-02 04:36:16 Yes...they do it now because China wants the commodities and the other countries have commodities but not dollars (that still have value).  But in a future where Dollar is worthless, these countries won’t give China commodities when they can give them worthless dollars instead.
281 2018-01-02 04:25:29 No, they're arbitraging the gross underpricing of commodities rel to incipient USD supplies by swapping USD's today for future phys supplies of oil, going out a long time.  After china controls enough phys supplies of commodities, then they control the int'l trade value of USD
282 2018-01-02 04:25:00 But they can get the hard assets by just buying them.  Buying commodities with dollars does not mean China can’t still move away from dollar system.
283 2018-01-02 04:22:25 And china is getting hard assets (ie commodities) in return
284 2018-01-02 04:19:26 Please feel free to block us if our views are controversial, like preposterous state government funds being spent on football and not on public commodities like schools and healthcare.
285 2018-01-02 04:15:29 Why would China lend the dollars to the exporters rather than just buying the commodities directly with the dollars?
286 2018-01-02 04:12:01 China short commodities, long USD's (in FX reserves.)  Commodity exporters short USD, long commodities.  China lends USD's to Commodity exporter whose USD liability then falls.  China's left w/commodity supply at low prices; commodity exporter is out of their USD jam...no?
287 2018-01-02 04:11:18 It just occurred to me that three of the four major bowls are named after commodities: Sugar, Orange, Cotton. #SugarBowl
288 2018-01-02 04:07:00 They would pay it back in a different currency pursuant to the objective of destroying USD hegemony (long-term view). 

They would pay it back in commodities because their creditor so chooses (also possibly linked to the former motivation).
289 2018-01-02 04:02:41 Capitalism thrives on  your addiction to its commodities, these commodities include marijuana, cocaine, heroin, meth etc etc
290 2018-01-02 03:58:53 No, I'm not. You simply refuse to hear what I'm saying: that "dollars" in the #AlternateDollarUniverse will simply disappear, with dollar obligations repaid in commodities and other currencies. Precisely what I said last summer when you mocked me relentlessly.

293 2018-01-02 03:32:47 Curious to peel the onion back and see if Commodities are breaking out in general.
294 2018-01-02 03:17:11 when the global equities/commodities markets take an inevitable turn from their bull run .. what will happen to crypto asset prices do people think?
295 2018-01-02 03:16:05 I'm not sure I follow you.  If welfare or unemployment only pays 10,000 per year, for example only, there are certain commodities these people are unable to consume.  If BI pays the 20,000 per year they can use the additional 10,000 to consume more commodities.
296 2018-01-02 03:03:52 For fuck's sake bro... They are two different historic forms of national oppression. Their deep functioning is quite different. For example, in colonialism, they were the commodities flows that prevailed, whereas in imperialism, they are the capital ones instead.
297 2018-01-02 02:49:17 In fact money is produce base on gold and commodities worldwide and also depends on the countries reserves of such kind of metals and commodities, bitcoin is a fiasco, however is there many people making money, the start is good, the end will be burst
298 2018-01-02 02:45:30 My resolution is to learn how to trade commodities this year
299 2018-01-02 02:43:01 I hope you learn that emotions and communication are not commodities to be held hostage
300 2018-01-02 02:27:50 I worry about their idols endlessly. They’re treated like commodities and then disrespected for things outside their control. There’s so much pressure on them.

303 2018-01-02 02:17:13 The corporate definition of love is obsessed with commodities, property, and hoarding of things and experiences.
304 2018-01-02 02:02:58 I mentioned on the #Bloomberg #ETFIQ show that inflation, in our view, is rising.  Commodities are 1) uncorrelated 2) under-owned, and 3) historically have done well when inflation rises.  In a world where most assets are expensive or at fair value, #commodities are cheap.
305 2018-01-02 02:00:40 @kishorenarne  Can you share your views for one week price movement of non ferrous metals.. especially Nickel, Aluminum.. #commodities
306 2018-01-02 01:58:44 The rate of change for inflation is turning (don’t look now, but commodities posted back to back positive years for the 1st time since 2010).  #Commodities #BCOM $COMB

312 2018-01-02 01:27:53 For the US Dollar chart tweeted few minutes ago a break below 91 will cause a spike in commodities (oil, gold, miners, etc) and a selloff in emerging markets (ticker EDC). The drop in US Dollar might get triggered if US earnings next week do not come out stronger than expected.

314 2018-01-02 01:21:24 Sorry if I’m being ignorant, but isn’t feminism about the belief in the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes? My understanding is that Iranian women are suppressed &treated like commodities.
315 2018-01-02 01:12:33 It's almost like the expansionary process of capitalism where you trade money for commodities, have workers under your employ apply labor power, then trade commodities for money isn't necessary, inevitable, or good and turns everyone into mere cogs in the machine ruled by things.
316 2018-01-02 01:10:04 But in this case your robbing Peter to pay Paul. Look I want a competitive team as much you. However if we trade off our only known commodities in JDG & NS you can get big talent back. Yc your stuck with as no one will take his contract as of now. Maybe different in July #LGM
317 2018-01-02 01:07:09 That's a lot of what-ifs and maybes like stock market bombs & pulls commodities ith it. Honestly, it wouldn't surprise me but it's mostly speculation. Empirical facts are that inventories have been falling & oil prices have been rising. That can change but till it does...

323 2018-01-02 00:29:21 Numerology, astronomy, the philosophies of old are personal endeavors not commercial commodities. Stay woke kids.
324 2018-01-02 00:11:20 I clearly LOVE the #Stocks $ES_F... but anyone that really knows me knows I prefer #Commodities this year... I think the classics #Gold $GC_F & #Oil $CL_F will be most popular, but the commodity currencies like $AUD $NZD $CAD will benefit as well from this money flow.
325 2018-01-02 00:10:43 It's money they can never use or need. It's all a game to them, basically a war on the poor. Psychopaths who only see others as commodities because they can
326 2018-01-02 00:06:13 In all due respect POTUS; so long as our economy is based on utilizing children, babies and people like commodities our country is functioning completely outside of God's law and will only deteriorate and eventually will only desimate itself.
327 2018-01-02 00:04:20 Can't wait for the first U.S. Dollar "crash" of 2018... Once that $DXY starts heading back towards the lows... We will finally get to see some #inflation... #commodities (mostly #metals & #grains) but also #energy... as well as #stocks & many other #FX will benefit to the upside!
