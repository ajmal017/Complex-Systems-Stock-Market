1 2018-05-21 23:59:34 Would be 5W-30 I would think. That would be a pain if you wanted a fleet oil for both newer and older machines, Pretty sure the drum we have is 10W-40, that’s compatible with our newest tractor with adblu, and all our older machines.

3 2018-05-21 23:59:30 We need to slow oil pumping down and stop the carelessness of it before we lose it all and animals lose their lives. #stopmalpracticeoilpumping
4 2018-05-21 23:59:05 Good question! There are many different possibilities. We need to keep watching and see whether it's the Arabs, the coffee people, the most obvious response is the oil people, but the obvious answer is not always the correct one LOL
5 2018-05-21 23:58:47 Oil dependency is not the issue. Plastic waste is.
6 2018-05-21 23:58:46 To cold up north trust me lol. Did my Time up there. Those truckers haulin oil/water or whatever for the oil fields makes some serious coin.
7 2018-05-21 23:58:30 the whole show sucks.  Crichton  rolling in his grave.
8 2018-05-21 23:58:20 I'd say that Alberta is a huge mix of it all.

But the 'down and out' oil worker that can't pay for all their toys after blowing it as it came has been a stereotype proped up by various sides and reports
9 2018-05-21 23:58:07 Anything for big Oil, right? How much money has your office taken in donations from oil and gas lobbyists total? How about a little disclosure for your constituents Senator?
10 2018-05-21 23:57:59 You can fry it in a shallow skillet with oil, but it really will stink up your house, I've never baked it before this was the first time...turned out better than frying EVER has...and no smelling up the house.
11 2018-05-21 23:57:47 me, staring at myself in the mirror as I coated my body in coconut oil before going into the sun at a UV index of 8: this is a terrible idea
me, now burnt to a crisp, so burnt that I have constant chills: well at least I was right about something

14 2018-05-21 23:57:26 I don’t disagree, but I doubt that the market is large enough that taking this away from the maybe dozens of people who could want it is comparable to reducing our dependency on oil in general.
15 2018-05-21 23:57:18 I'm sure it will be delicious. Yes, handling oil slicked food is tricky.

40 2018-05-21 23:56:51 Summer travel season is beginning, they gouge us every year. Record profits and a world wide glut of oil not withstanding.
41 2018-05-21 23:56:43 Kim jong-un got played when the sanctiones got serious against  providing oil and coal. That's when he wanted to be nice.    and North Korea are not friends there is no human rights. Count your lucky  because  are the only ones who will  them.
42 2018-05-21 23:56:37 razor rash & bumps are different things. razor bumps are caused by ingrown hairs. 
ways to clear razor bumps: 
-don’t shave for 2-3 days 
-use bio oil 
-apple cider vinegar 
-honey 
-a cold / hot compress 
-baby powder 
-cucumber
43 2018-05-21 23:56:35 That's what they want. Not interested to control oil prices but want to make money from temples. If idiots sit in power then this what happens.
44 2018-05-21 23:56:27 Just a tad , would barely rub it in some oil before I carry it 
45 2018-05-21 23:56:08 I would put the power into the opt-in collective and have it collect fees on behalf of its members, e.g. make Facebook pay for showing advertisements to users who have a DigID. Get the UN / climate council to agree to a USD50/barrel charge on oil traded on commodities markets
46 2018-05-21 23:55:06 I do love Brie, with sautéed peppers, eggplant in olive oil. Yum! #tytlive
47 2018-05-21 23:54:46 Me last week. I had one on my ankle that was just killer. The trick is to either rub a thick oil on them like coconut or Vaseline, or cover with band-aids. The air exposure is what triggers the nerve endings. When covered, they itch way less.

51 2018-05-21 23:54:05 Im still thinking longingly and lovingly about those wings i ate yesterday

The hot oil still sizzles songs of romance on my soul
52 2018-05-21 23:53:58 Serious national security issues? More fishy business involving FBI/DOJ/CIA?  
Trying this case in court going to be tricky.
53 2018-05-21 23:53:43 if you are looking for a future Iran by asking America for help, Just look at Iraq and Lybia who received US help, that is your future. they don't care about your freedom, they want the oil under your feet.
54 2018-05-21 23:53:41 I’d have to get an old echo chart out to check the depth of water there.  Perhaps an oil platform.
55 2018-05-21 23:53:38 $SPY not much has changed-2600-2750 bullish trading range:
>2580 -- earns expectations, global growth (oil+), good valuation
<2750 -- trade talk uncertainty
<2800 -- higher # of rate hikes (18/19) than expected
<3000 -- fear interest pyts increasing (debt)
Wildcard: geo-politics
56 2018-05-21 23:53:38 Next edition should be oil cooling a radiator xD
57 2018-05-21 23:53:38 Well said, sir. In the same way educate me about crude oil price year by year, please.
58 2018-05-21 23:53:35 曲ききました？？どうですか！？
59 2018-05-21 23:53:29 Again Putin owns a major block of ZTE, and Russia was on the brink of financial collapse due to their intervention in Syria.  That is until Trump caused the recent spike in oil price and gave them some breathing room.  Trump is Making Russia Great Again.
60 2018-05-21 23:53:28 You might like them prepared differently. You never know. I chop them up and roast them with olive oil.

63 2018-05-21 23:53:13 Need to oil Mother soon. Get all the hard-to-reach places.
64 2018-05-21 23:53:10 Let me expand that for you. For every $100 of YOUR oil, the oil companies get $98.10. You get  $1.90. And that's your gross! You still have administrative costs. You're playing your electorate &  for fools. Big oil is the problem. You're practically paying THEM!
65 2018-05-21 23:53:05 @RachelNotley @JustinTrudeau @gmbutts owned by big oil
66 2018-05-21 23:52:42 coconut oil is my best friend
67 2018-05-21 23:52:42 I voted for Obama in 2008, as I'd bought the Snake Oil he was selling. Never again will I vote Democrat.

American lives go before the occupation and feelings of terrorists.

It's ironic that feminists complain about HRV of terrorists, but not the aborted.
68 2018-05-21 23:52:39 I hope Rachel Notley takes effort to calm down and study more school, electronics is a good course. And leave the oil alone.
69 2018-05-21 23:52:26 I made my husband a little pot of lip scrub for his winter chapped lips — just coconut oil and sugar. It’s even edible and tasty! Finally, he has taken to hennaing his hair and beard like a duck to water. It’s subtle but makes him feel good about himself!
70 2018-05-21 23:52:23 If you want it to grow back already I recommend wild growth hair oil it works good
71 2018-05-21 23:52:13 I have a love hate relationship with getting my oil changed on my car
72 2018-05-21 23:52:03 ways to get rid of razor rash, apply any of these things: 
-aloe vera 
-a hot compress 
-lemon juice 
-tea tree oil 
-white tea 
what causes razor rash? 
dry shaving, shaving that’s too aggressive and a dull blade.
73 2018-05-21 23:52:02 OK if you think that is easier to do. And taxing oil companies will just pass (most of) the cost onto the end user regardless.
74 2018-05-21 23:51:36 @Presidence_RDC Hello Cabinet du President My is enock Bakondula i live in Australia but I am Congolese citizen by birth I want to speak with Mr Le President Joseph Kabila Kabange regarding to build a PPRD australia, an ambassy of congo in australia and oil&gaz
75 2018-05-21 23:51:32 Getting shit done. Got my hair cut, gonna get an oil change tomorrow and set up my appt to rotate/balance my tires Saturday 
76 2018-05-21 23:51:31 A mockingjay pin and castor oil
77 2018-05-21 23:51:27 An exgirlfriend of mine bought me oil pencils, so I could make notes on the plastic shower wall. Sometimes I miss her.
78 2018-05-21 23:51:20 Not if all the cheese making, tomato picking, flour people go!! There will be no pizza. Not to mention the olive oil picking making people.
79 2018-05-21 23:51:13 Knotley+Trudeau r delusional about pipeline jobs+avoid talking risk to B.C.. Project is most risky yet least profitable for B.C. Its shocking that oil baron puppets r willing to sacrifice us. All Canadians should have equal rights: includes right to sustainable environment.
80 2018-05-21 23:51:07 where can I get a oil change for the low low
81 2018-05-21 23:51:01 ชงกันเก่งเกิ้นนนน
82 2018-05-21 23:50:58 They gonna vote.
83 2018-05-21 23:50:52 Maybe @reveal should investigate workplace hazards at the oil patch. In fact, maybe they should investigate who sponsored this story. Probably the same groups that sponsored all the other "journalism" that coincidentally came out at same time.
84 2018-05-21 23:50:49 โอ้ยชอบ เหมือนจะไม่ทีอะไรแต่มี5555
85 2018-05-21 23:50:48 it is highway robbery...these oil companies all got a tax break but not pass on to us.
86 2018-05-21 23:50:35 Beautiful. My great grandfather was also from Colombia and migrated to Esmeraldas as a  teenager to work in oil extraction. He was from Chocó.

90 2018-05-21 23:49:53 Start protesting against Saudi dollars and oil coming back to your country to produce more bombs killing innocent people all over the world! Saudi Arabia is producing your GDP!!!!
91 2018-05-21 23:49:48 Any of my fellow editors have issues with ur stylus & screen friction?? It was driving me insane, it obviously makes ur strokes skip...had to get ghetto & polish the screen & tip of my stylus with vitamin E oil lmfaoooo and it’s SMOOTH SAILING from there 
92 2018-05-21 23:49:46 Neviah stay trying to slick a can of oil. 
93 2018-05-21 23:49:40 This nigga went to the store for coconut oil and came back with a $130 bottle of Hennessy random af. And still no coconut oil 
94 2018-05-21 23:49:35 Nope, that’s a special service reserved for pretty girls. I can’t even count how many tire shop guys, oil change dudes, tanning salon cashiers, bank tellers, windshield repair men, gym staff, and car salesman I’ve had to run off over the years. Pitfalls of having a pretty wife 
95 2018-05-21 23:49:34 @ThmsHoward Look at your picture. I wouldn't trust you to change the oil in my car. What a joke.
96 2018-05-21 23:49:24 “Lavender helps with stress”

97 2018-05-21 23:49:14 A.o.a bhai agar sar py oil laga hoa ho to sar ka massa ho jay ga ? Allama kumail mehdavi @WaseemBadami
98 2018-05-21 23:49:08 Yes that oil price really went up and of course those other [unstated] "factors"  The truth is @RachelNotley has been Cool Hand Luke and you cons can't stand it.
99 2018-05-21 23:49:04 油を英訳すると、なんて言うか知ってるかい?
100 2018-05-21 23:49:01 It's like... idk, but you know how coconut flavored stuff from like Cub Foods/Walmart/etc taste different from coconut flavored stuff from Asian stores? It does not taste like the flavor from Asian storesㅠㅠ I felt like I was drinking something with coconut oilㅠㅠㅠ
101 2018-05-21 23:49:01 Get woke, go broke.
102 2018-05-21 23:48:48 I need to invent something to help get this damn oil and grease off my hands after work
103 2018-05-21 23:48:40 Hlo oil ka kaam nahi hame
104 2018-05-21 23:48:00 A responsible government would realise there is no future in the oil industry and to save our planet transformation into a clean energy future needs to start now.
105 2018-05-21 23:47:51 @Shortolany if it like, it should rain crude oil
106 2018-05-21 23:47:43 I hate to see beautiful women with dark underarms... ladies please exfoliate your underarms, switch your deodorant, use vitamins E and olive oil under your arms. I really just want us all to glow so don’t take my advice personal... your underarms just shouldn’t be black sis.
107 2018-05-21 23:47:13 Damn, use peppermint or eucalyptus oil in a hot shower  shit helps for real
108 2018-05-21 23:47:08 Not only do leftists want to tell you WHAT you can drink they now want to tell you HOW you can drink it.
109 2018-05-21 23:47:07 @CNNnews18 sir talk about high oil prices directly inflames inflation to 70 % population sir even below 100 $ in international market constant post 2014 govt. saved 7 lakh crore but still we pay more why any body has answer
110 2018-05-21 23:47:06 The Russian economy is addicted to oil exports. Duh.

114 2018-05-21 23:46:48 The oil guy should be fired because he probably forgot to put oil in it. I went to Dover in 08 and @KurtBusch wrecked on the 2nd lap, I stayed because I'm a fan of racing but it was tough for sure. He also crashed during the first stage of last years spring race at Dover.
115 2018-05-21 23:46:41 "Get the pipeline built" What then? World markets, out of the control of any Albertan or Canadian political grandstanding will find a cheaper, more easily processed oil This is such short term thinking on a time when we're actually dependent on foreign oil despite drowning in it.
116 2018-05-21 23:46:37 @TimesNow sir talk about high oil prices directly inflames inflation to 70 % population sir even below 100 $ in international market constant post 2014 govt. saved 7 lakh crore but still we pay more why any body has answer
117 2018-05-21 23:46:33 Yeah right! Oil test 81 again
118 2018-05-21 23:46:25 I just made this Amla oil lmao it stinks
119 2018-05-21 23:46:24 今でも後悔してる。(再会できて良かった)
120 2018-05-21 23:46:13 Ohhh yeah gadaffi was dictator 
Enjoy Hillary Clinton jihad 

Election?  Jihadist in suite run your election ,
This days nobody care about Tunisia, Libya or that part of the world, mission complete

Sit n be quite and suffer 
Ohhh gaddafi was dictator
121 2018-05-21 23:46:00 if you end up getting a hyaluronic acid (ヒヤルロン酸) lotion generally you want to apply it on slightly damp skin and then lock it in with an emollient like an oil or a cream
122 2018-05-21 23:45:50 Oil change, brakes changed, ita a good dirtyyy dayyy
123 2018-05-21 23:45:46 Whip together 1 pound hamburger  with 2 tablespoons Ahi Tuna. Add generous amounts of Olive Oil. Drain. Serve with salmon
124 2018-05-21 23:45:41 bought a new lawn mower.
assembled in 15 minutes.
gas and oil.
1 pull and the motor started.
big smile.
125 2018-05-21 23:45:27 The oil 1/8 to 1/4th if injuries we need more
126 2018-05-21 23:45:09 Oi - I take transit. It’s electric. My bicycle doesn’t need your oil either.
127 2018-05-21 23:44:53 Supply of O/G is highly impacted by geopolitical events- watch your pump price as Venezuela supply drops off. Stable, environmentally well managed oil supply is an important economic strength for our country. Nice plane in ur profile- needs fuel? Just saying...
128 2018-05-21 23:44:52 Radical Islam isn't America's reason for meddling in the Middle East, oil is. You may recall the last Republican president invaded Iraq against UN advice over weapons of mass destruction that didn't exist. Then we proceeded to destroy their country.  What do you call that? Help?
129 2018-05-21 23:44:25 Does tea tree oil really combat acne and acne scars?
130 2018-05-21 23:44:12 So it's acceptable to you? Rail is safer to move oil? Saudi oil shipped via oceans preferred?  Ask the people of Lac-Mégantic what they think
131 2018-05-21 23:44:11 You’re putting WAY too much thought into this oil short process. All you need to do is wait about one to two weeks for Gartman to be massive long, say he was wrong on oil and say it won’t drop below $70 again. You know it’s coming and will be the time to initiate short.
132 2018-05-21 23:44:02 You can use all sorts actually -  sesame oil, clove oil...my coconut oil habis and EVOO happens to say "try me" 
133 2018-05-21 23:44:02 urea creams can also help with like feet/hands/elbows! body butters are generally just emollients that help keep moisture in (bc oil based) but they don't add anything per se, and for me personally i dont like the heavy feeling
134 2018-05-21 23:43:46 Without question. Born at seminary and raised in the UCC by feminist parents. But I didn’t feel that spirit-level connection until synod in 2001 where a young, female seminarian in a fiery red dress touched my forehead with oil and said, “my sister...”
135 2018-05-21 23:43:43 Ill never forgive Xavier for my stretch marks lol when I was pregnant I would put bio oil on my stomach to prevent stretch marks, riiiiight. Well then I stopped cause I could no longer see the bottom of my stomach so I would ask xavier if I had stretch marks & this dude

140 2018-05-21 23:43:16 No, aircraft was perfect. It was me not allowing the oil to heat up enough which caused the pressure to be slightly higher than normal. No issue with the aircraft.
141 2018-05-21 23:43:11 By 2000, the fervor for all things dot-com pushed the tech sector to almost 24%, while oil fell below 5%
142 2018-05-21 23:43:05 The fads have been more extreme in the past. In 1980, oil and gas stocks were 23% of world market value, as investors sought protection from inflation, while the tech sector fell below 6%. (continued)
143 2018-05-21 23:43:04 Taking a simple bird's eye view of their interconnection, wonder if this is accurate

Russia Israel - Gas, Money, Far right, & Israel trying to sway Putin on Iran
Saudi Israel Gulf - Money & united against Iran
Russia Saudi Gulf - Oil prices, Money, & trying to sway Putin on Iran
144 2018-05-21 23:43:04 I don’t make gold oil lol
145 2018-05-21 23:42:56 Banana boat tanning oil is the only thing I need during summer
146 2018-05-21 23:42:56 Bullshit. Oil is a commodity, traded on the open market. The price fluctuates just like every other commodity. Individual states impose taxes on gas, for various reasons. California has some of the highest gas taxes in the country, trying to provide for millions of illegals.
147 2018-05-21 23:42:31 The Middle East has shifted away from #petrowars. From #oil-centric war led by US in earlier Gulf wars, it is now regional power-centric war betw lead rivals #Saudi and #Iran. I give a orange light for any trigger of regional #War that may go out of hand.

150 2018-05-21 23:42:06 Took my car in for an oil change today. I meant to do that a couple months ago. :)
151 2018-05-21 23:42:02 And of course you see the age old reason why Russia supports Syria apart from oil pipelines. For 100s of years the Russians have wanted a permanent base in the Med. They will defend it to the end.
152 2018-05-21 23:42:00 We deal with patients recovering from addiction daily. Have to do something to keep people from turning to street drugs. CBD Oil is an excellent option.

154 2018-05-21 23:41:58 This plan for Iran would result in higher oil prices and; 1. Enrich GOP big donors, 2. make Russia happy, and 3. cost American consumers more $$. @POTUS, doing as much as possible for the Russians before he gets thrown in prison. #LieAndDeny #toldyouso

160 2018-05-21 23:40:59 Because @NicolaSturgeon said independence transcends Brexit oil and the economy. She'll never call it anyway .... she just bluffing to deflect what really happening and she knows it's not viable to. Just another grievance tactic against rUK
161 2018-05-21 23:40:55 Trump is finding a way to conspire with other oil producing countries to screw American drivers. Happy deplorable driving trump fans.

163 2018-05-21 23:40:35 Mike: You and I know that today's Islamic  Iran is the result of U.S. support for the Shah's brutal regime. Also, that the U.S. is contriving a pretext to grab Iran's oil, a la Iraq. And, Henry Kissinger with: "America has no permanent friends or enemies, only interests."MAGA?

172 2018-05-21 23:39:25 Lots of Basra light used to get taken to Caribbean tanks.."A good example was during Iran's oil embargo (70's). Lots of Iranian oil would go to Aruba. At first to shore tanks (excellent facility there) then just StoS and on to the US with new 'birth certificate' for the oil.
173 2018-05-21 23:39:20 Diamonds ain't rare, oil ain't either.
174 2018-05-21 23:39:20 -you can use baby oil, conditioner, shea butter, soap, raw honey, peanut butter, aloe vera, body lotion etc to shave  your legs & get a finer shave

Me I like spinach, kale, crumble goat cheese, Blue berries and balsamic vinegar and olive oil.
181 2018-05-21 23:37:46 in general if u layer a bunch of thinner water based moisturizing things and then lock it in with something oil based it will help it last a lot longer :0 esp if the thinner ones have hyaluronic acid
182 2018-05-21 23:37:41 How about lower gas prices while your big donors in saudi arabia.want higher oil prices.while also saudi gasoline prices r around 90 cents gallon and over here. we keep higher and higher prices.
183 2018-05-21 23:37:37 Olive oil and avocado oil are also great.
184 2018-05-21 23:37:33 Canada and the US need to work together on oil and natural gas, they could be a bigger powerhouse in the world if they did, plus it helps my job as we make allot of steel for the oil and gas industry.
185 2018-05-21 23:37:27 @dpradhanbjp sir oil prices above 100 $ before but post 2014 below 100 $ constant from last 4 years but we forced to pay more could 't able to understand the logic behind  govt.

1.9% royalty? BRILLIANT! 
195 2018-05-21 23:36:21 Does this include olive oil? I honestly thought an olive was a fruit.
196 2018-05-21 23:35:47 okay now i smell like cocoa oil
197 2018-05-21 23:35:40 Damn. I only use CBD w/ crazy low THC oil so I don’t have much to compare too :(

211 2018-05-21 23:33:58 We’re getting our oil changed at town Toyota Bc ya know, it’s free. And they’re like “uhhh we have something to show you on your truck” they open the hood and our battery has come loose and smashed the fuck out of our sensors. And is laying on our engine block.
212 2018-05-21 23:33:55 Paul Ryan did you discuss affordable healthcare for the middle class?
What are you doing about the higher interest rates and the feds inflationary worries from your tax cuts for the wealthy.?
Did you mention the tax insensitives for big oil to drill in Utah and Texas on your land
213 2018-05-21 23:33:54 Mileage may vary, but a friend of mine who quit said those tea tree oil toothpicks really helped her ... not necessarily cuz of the tea tree oil but just always having one in her mouth helped with the oral fixation part of it. Good luck and stay strong!
214 2018-05-21 23:33:44 That looks really good. I’ve done smoked stuffed bell peppers before. I use brisket, Spanish rice, diced tomatoes/onions. Mix a little olive oil, butter, BBQ sauce together, coat meat 1st, stuff, wrap in foil. Takes about 1-1/2 hrs. Kinda like chili rellenos in a way.
215 2018-05-21 23:33:40 Exceptional  oil/gas opportunity!

217 2018-05-21 23:33:04 - do not lick them! licking them will only make them drier

Just like oil on my hands
Oh, I do love you

222 2018-05-21 23:31:49 What are u using? A lot of ppl use treadmill oil or silicone. I cant use either cuz im highly allergic to them. So i used 99% alcohol
223 2018-05-21 23:31:34 Mr. Reid, please keep “the least amongst us all” in ur legislative decisions, for acadiana it’s the university Medical Center and the 65,000 patients/ year and the 800 great paying medical jobs for our troubled oil economy. Our house republicans delegation has turned it back.
224 2018-05-21 23:31:31 Things I’ve found make a good soup:

4) more cheese

226 2018-05-21 23:31:26 @JZarif Translation of Message To Iran Today (sing if you can): “The Party’s Over”. US doesn’t need your oil anymore. The Iranian people already hate Mullahs and protests will intensify. Sanctions will be withering, accelerating Iranian dissent. @khamenei_ir  Days are Numbered.
227 2018-05-21 23:31:20 And if it worked that way I wouldn't have 65% of my tax dollars going to the military so they can destabilize another government for our government's oil interests. But we don't get to pick and choose how our taxes are spent.
228 2018-05-21 23:31:16 Note to self, oil pulling with extra virgin olive oil is a BAD idea 
229 2018-05-21 23:31:11 Drowned myself in baby oil to take my tan off n im acc sliding all over the gaff - mistakes were made 
230 2018-05-21 23:31:11 Yup. Extending a nation’s power is how these problems are created, whether it’s a tiny little oil dacratorship or an allegedly democratic western nation. Same cause, same effect. I include my own country in this, too.
231 2018-05-21 23:30:49 The president’s campaign chairman was getting $500k a month from Qatar for absolutely nothing. Same Qatar that bought 19% of the Russian oil company Rosneft. Same Russia that promised Trump a 1% fee of that deal AND got him elected
232 2018-05-21 23:30:38 To be honest, it helps.
It really helps if you use a 50:50 CBD :THC oil, but this can be expensive.
Don't buy "RSO" oils which are hemp extracts and mostly CBD from stalks and leaves.
Your best bet is to start off making it yourself, while you grow plants for later harvest.

At the same time the OPEC oil cartel and other oil-producing countries — notably Russia — have agreed to restrict production to boost prices. And it seems to be working.

That’s not a bad thing. Do we really want them moving around more than 5% of the time? A car sitting idle is not burning oil or spewing pollution.
241 2018-05-21 23:30:09 Listen. Brussel sprouts are the best food. Roast those lil green bbs with some olive oil and your other fav veggies and you got a feast.

246 2018-05-21 23:29:50 MCT Oil is great stuff! Whats even better are the reviews. Trust me, you will not be sorry. 
247 2018-05-21 23:29:47 You can have coffee during your intermittent fasting and as a matter of fact you can even put butter and oil in it and it will not break your fast

249 2018-05-21 23:29:14 I will not forget how we were bombarded with this gloom and doom. Along with 17% interest rates and oil shortage.
250 2018-05-21 23:28:44 It appears corps. can come ruin the scenery, suck up as many $'s they can. Bleeding the resources off until disaster strikes. Cut their losses and bounce. How much does that oil and gas really cost? It comes with back end impact. That seems like paying way more per gal.

257 2018-05-21 23:27:20 There we go. Interchangeable “Tar sands (also referred to as oil sands) are a combination of clay, sand, water, and bitumen, a heavy black viscous oil. Tar sands can be mined and processed to extract the oil-rich bitumen, which is then refined into oil.”

271 2018-05-21 23:26:18 Come on! We'll be too busy shining our new pickups to ever worry about that.  Besides, we've spent the last 10 years claiming that we're "cleaning up nature's pollution" by extracting oil from the tar sands, so who's going to believe there's a problem?

291 2018-05-21 23:23:30 Sadly considering the cost you will find very few places that fry things with Olive oil, Coconut Oil or even butter, which are a whole lot healthier fats.

Also, avoid margarine at any costs. Soy been oil is also not the best for you because it triggers inflammatory responses.

306 2018-05-21 23:21:33 They've got their own renewable energy sources that none of us know about I'm sure. The oil industry is deliberately manipulated for profits anyway. They control how much oil is produced, they control the prices.

313 2018-05-21 23:20:45 Saudi is an ally because they export oil. I don't see the trust here, really. It is more like a "necessary" evil. Because people need to drive huge trucks and shit.

328 2018-05-21 23:19:05 Could Venezuelan oil money somehow be involved, perhaps?
329 2018-05-21 23:18:59 Foreign investment has increased in every sector except oil and gas. Economists on both sides agree that NAFTA uncertainty and U.S. tax cuts are to blame for decreased investment in Canadian oil and gas.
330 2018-05-21 23:18:56 Coated it in rice flour and cooked it in a nonstick skillet for about 3 minutes per side with a few tsp of olive oil. Then added sauce!

332 2018-05-21 23:18:39 Literally SOAK it in oil over night. I promise it really helps. I had the same issue when I colored my hair dark.

334 2018-05-21 23:18:38 NO INDUSTRY? Scotland has the highest food and drink exports in the UK, the only part of the UK with a trade surplus. Glasgow has the largest satellite industry in Europe. The Scottish game industry is surging, up 1/4 since 2016. And oh, yes, the price of oil and gas has rocketed
335 2018-05-21 23:18:06 This time around is very rare where Oil price move together with USD. We suspect that it has to do with Saudi Aramco IPO.

342 2018-05-21 23:17:37 It depends on the oil you use. Unfortunately most deep fried food you can buy is usually not fried with decent oils, it's not really changed regularly either.
343 2018-05-21 23:17:32 Thought I'd spray with moisturising oil before bed to help with the suntan/burnt bits... I now smell yuck... Cats won't come near me :(
344 2018-05-21 23:17:05 Man thats wassup thats giving me some ideas fr, you make sales to like dealerships or big private companies? Like is it oil for the automotive industry or different petrol?

346 2018-05-21 23:16:56 My car almost exploded today thanks to the ppl changing my oil  litterally caught on fire
347 2018-05-21 23:16:43 wash days (by like 5 days) helps when my hair is really dry because it allows the natural oils to settle. Also, I don't wash out my conditioner before styling.

If it's REALLY dry, I stop doing washngos and focus on protective styling with lots of oil/moisturizer for a few weeks.
348 2018-05-21 23:16:39 Chef Ramses cut up some potatoes, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was his first born child, along with hot sauce.
349 2018-05-21 23:16:31 There is a good reason why they won’t sign long term contracts for oil. They won’t be using as much and they don’t think prices will be high in the future. 2/2
350 2018-05-21 23:16:18 THE BEST!!!!
351 2018-05-21 23:16:15 Oh thank *you* for inspiring me to oil up my iron.
352 2018-05-21 23:16:14 “I think my car might be out of oil but I’m not sure”

Well did you check the oil?

“No? I’m a girl, I shouldn’t have to do that”
353 2018-05-21 23:15:29 Five-year forward prices in crude oil have risen even more rapidly than spot prices, bringing into question the "lower for longer" oil price mantra, says Bloomberg @business.

359 2018-05-21 23:15:15 Ethanol isn't a good fuel. It waters down gasoline causing your engine to be inefficient. That causes you to buy more gas from oil companies. It also attracts water that can make engines run bad or damage them. Check your mileage and put it to $ vs unleaded if u don't believe me.

410 2018-05-21 23:08:26 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
411 2018-05-21 23:08:15 Let’s make a deal on that Tuna Painting! It is an original Oil painting of Pistol Pete! Very cool piece
412 2018-05-21 23:08:06 Can someone take my car to get its oil changed tomorrow ?

415 2018-05-21 23:07:57 They have already reduced purchases of VZ oil to lower than the pre-revolution level. 

They do want to tank the economy. That's indisputable. 

That's the point of economic sanctions; to intentionally fuck with economies to provoke regime change. 

They've done it so many times.

418 2018-05-21 23:07:29 I do meditate every second day maybe. Try to practice mindfulness. I have CBD oil ...may try it
419 2018-05-21 23:07:17 I don't know if he had a guy take his cash . But he had  nice house on sugarbush where I lived and brand new vette , I was 18-19 managed a oil change on 23 mile and see him always go to a low income apt down the street known for drugs and rumor was out there ,
420 2018-05-21 23:07:11 it is necessary to have a plan for oil spill control as well as other Anthropocene originated disasters, between the most critical: phosphorous contamination and nuclear spills
421 2018-05-21 23:07:07 I wonder what happened to those guys renting oil tankers to store cheap oil back in Jan 2016, when a barrel was $27.
422 2018-05-21 23:07:01 Surprisingly, rising oil prices benefit Russia either way 
423 2018-05-21 23:06:54 sniff snorf ah yes i love the smell of oil and machines

425 2018-05-21 23:06:48 Here is how I OIL PULL and the health benefits from it.  I'll post the link in the first reply so facebook doesn't ding me for it. Facebook is a bastard like that.  Look in the first reply. Feel free to share  =)
426 2018-05-21 23:06:42 You mean more govt ownership of everything like nationalized banks, insurance companies, oil companies so that tax payers like me continue to pay for subsidies, low standard product & services. @Indianlion13
427 2018-05-21 23:06:39 I made sriracha pork chops, potatoes with olive oil, butter & chives, wild rice, Brussels sprouts & watermelon. I wish there were leftovers but 4 teens at table
428 2018-05-21 23:06:32 I wonder how many do-gooder journalism outfits realize they have been hijacked by a coordinated media campaign sponsored by Big Oil, Big Auto and Big Union to crush Tesla.
429 2018-05-21 23:06:29 Many many countries our size survive very well - even without oil, renewables, whisky etc - and no one could make more of a mess than Westminster is just now!

431 2018-05-21 23:06:22 @YouTube I'd like to watch the @HealthRanger video on the healing benefits of cannabis oil, but you've taken it down. Any chance you'll apologise and restore it?

434 2018-05-21 23:06:20 The EPA’over the past year, courts have halted or reversed multiple Pruitt initiatives, in one case forcing the EPA to restore limits on methane leaks from oil and gas operations after a federal appeals panel concluded that their suspension was illegal. Via WaPo. {{Oops!}}
435 2018-05-21 23:06:19 Check how much it'll take to buy your Corolla off-lease first. Sometimes you can get them for a song, and if in good shape & you've been keeping the oil changes & maintenance up they'll go 300K to 400K miles easy. See Toyotas_Only @ Yahoogroups dot com
436 2018-05-21 23:05:48 Iranian Sanctions Immediately helped Russia’s Economy as oil prices rose.

438 2018-05-21 23:05:20 Well done dopey Donald. Since you assumed office and created world uncertainty the price of oil has dramatically increased to the point now where economies will slow as its hitting the consumer pockets. Idiot just can’t see past the mirror and self adoration
439 2018-05-21 23:05:14 adaa, grepeseed oil. aku ada prelovednya nih
440 2018-05-21 23:05:13 Perhaps Papadopolus has more to do with brokering oil deals with sanctioned entities then e-mails?

446 2018-05-21 23:04:53 So, we had their Nuke program controlled and in exchange of nothing, we quit the Deal...What a dumb MF.
Let me explain to Fox how Iran signed the Iran Deal.  China and Russia put sanctions,  India, Pakistan, Japan & others stopped buying oil.  We wont have that help again
447 2018-05-21 23:04:49 Hemp that is grown in industrial wastelands can absorb heavy metals in the soil/water.  This makes it good for crude oil spills, for heavy metal problems, but SHOULD NEVER be used internally for CBD purpose.  If you use cannabis for CBD purposes, make sure it's tested for safety.
448 2018-05-21 23:04:49 #DontBuyJeep These vehicles ar dangerous from 2015 to 2018 with electrical issues causing fires  and falling dead when they burn oil. My daughter almost got killed when her #jeep fell deaf in traffic. @Jeep
449 2018-05-21 23:04:47 Coconut oil!! Elli had one bad like that and I used that! Cleared up in a day or two.

451 2018-05-21 23:04:30 thank god we had cake mix bc my brain feels too funky to handle anything more than chucking eggs and oil into some powder
452 2018-05-21 23:04:28 I learn so much from reading your tweets. Dijon mustard .... fork oil ... Chopin .... 
453 2018-05-21 23:04:09 The book has already been written on Venezuela unfortunately.  Even with sanctions on oil, outcome prob was the same anyway
454 2018-05-21 23:03:51 i was, and i did. :) i ran the numbers and my sunday dinner consisted of a whopping 650 grams of marinated pork. (marinated in olive oil, lemon juice, red wine vinegar, chopped red onions and plenty of garlic)
455 2018-05-21 23:03:32 Also putting oil and water together has no benefit but potentially an interracial couple have the benefits of companionship, love and if we do eventually get to a point where there’s basically one giant mixed race then racism will struggle to survive.
456 2018-05-21 23:03:29 Her: Omg you want anal!

459 2018-05-21 23:03:11 @cvpayne Google and Facebook are E Corp as portrayed in Mr. Robot  both evil and dangerous, to compare to Standard Oil case is stretching believability

468 2018-05-21 23:02:00 The effect of TRAIN on pump prices is only an additional 2.65 per liter last January. Being a specific tax, it doesn’t go up regardless of world oil price situation. VAT is ad valorem.
469 2018-05-21 23:01:55 Like I just learned that Brewers ice cream isn’t really “ice cream” anymore. It’s frozen palm oil or something.....who knew??? 
470 2018-05-21 23:01:51 Fixing the ignition on the BBQ is a great way to demonstrate Dad skills. Penetrating oil, electrical tester and using a small screwdriver as a scraper to clean up the contacts.
471 2018-05-21 23:01:45 My coconut oil literally melted just walking from inside my job into my car 
472 2018-05-21 23:01:35 I watched the first couple of episodes of season 2... Kinda went nowhere..
473 2018-05-21 23:01:33 all the people who like to drink that car oil in a bottle are currently attacking me
474 2018-05-21 23:01:30 Thank you for the roasting, salting, and butter suggestion.  I've been using the chopped garlic packed in oil.
475 2018-05-21 23:01:28 Use peppermint oil, its a miracle worker. Glad you're doing better
476 2018-05-21 23:01:15 Give me a hug and a kiss when I come home with oil and grease all over me smelling like a wet labradoodle so I know it's real
477 2018-05-21 23:01:11 Oil killin it ... where did that surplus go?
478 2018-05-21 23:01:09 When conservatives (political parties) failed to get oil to market it was Obama’s fault. Now that a Liberal and NDP party are floundering, the blame rests solely on them. #falselogic #ableg
479 2018-05-21 23:01:09 We’re also going to hire 5,000 more Border Patrol agents, yet don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
480 2018-05-21 23:01:04 But oil and water aren’t conscious beings with emotions and thoughts of their own. By not putting them together you cause no harm. Trying to stop two people who want to be together because you don’t agree with their being interracial does.
481 2018-05-21 23:01:03 That moment when you go in for an oil change and they tell you your car has 926392 other problems that all cost $$$$$$$

490 2018-05-21 22:59:44 Glencore laundered money out of South Africa and bribed to secure an oil pipeline in Congo. 

Your public protector cared more about impressing Rupert than actually doing her work
491 2018-05-21 22:59:40 The stuff doesn't go off - it always has a layer of oil on top.
492 2018-05-21 22:59:19 I add cream and oil n sleep on a satin pillowcase. Sometimes I’ll wear a bonnet but normally I won’t

494 2018-05-21 22:59:04 I used peppers, onions, sesame seeds, sesame seed oil, and teriyaki sauce, probably not what’s supposed to be in it but I just thought “hey this might be good” and threw it in
495 2018-05-21 22:58:58 Plan: drop the tax rate and watch the oil companies pocket the difference
496 2018-05-21 22:58:58 @WITHDRAWN2 Take the oil 'And get the fuck out!
497 2018-05-21 22:58:48 You work for all of us, not just the folks who swallow your snake oil.
498 2018-05-21 22:58:47 Are they not biodegradable? I mean they degrade from far more benign things than the environment. 
499 2018-05-21 22:58:42 You can be allies without trusting someone. The problem with the Middle East is, each country is worse then the last but they all have so much oil...
On a side note, Saudi Arabia is on the UN women's rights committee. Now that's a joke if I've ever seen one.
500 2018-05-21 22:58:33 Which thing that US is doing legal?

Yeah,that one.

502 2018-05-21 22:58:26 I’m glad the grass is helping you. Does CBD oil have the same affect or is smoking the grass much more beneficial?
503 2018-05-21 22:58:17 1) smoked back bacon, buttered farmhouse bread, Daddies sauce for days 
2) coronation chicken on whole grain

5) cold turkey, stuffing, cranberries

504 2018-05-21 22:58:11 Global stock markets rallied broadly on Monday after the United States and China agreed to halt a trade war, while oil hit multi-year highs on political uncertainty and potential sanctions on Venezuela.
505 2018-05-21 22:58:08 rosehip oil is amazing for clearing up dark spots/ hyper-pigmentation!
506 2018-05-21 22:58:01 As for Purim in the White House well he’s there. He’s in the RNC. Not just him but Saudi princes too from what I’ve read today. Trumps dismantled the state depart. Cut clean air and water regs. Sold off parkland for big oil. He’s in bed with big pharma.
507 2018-05-21 22:57:42 idk about migraines but i use peppermint oil for my headaches. i know that may be a no go if you’re sensitive to smells. but a heating pad is also super helpful. just wrap it around your head like you would a warm washcloth.
508 2018-05-21 22:57:36 Sure looks like it. But the GOP, with the O standing for "oil" will do nothing.
509 2018-05-21 22:57:24 they also make an organic (edible)  version

expand oil drilling

what about this institution seems legitimate
513 2018-05-21 22:56:48 Iran backing into a corner on oil. Think sanctions will make it worth $? I think may push less to surrounding territories. Those barrels might not make mainstream. Good idea. Like to have a non political Convo. If that's cool. If it's heated I'm good. Canadian lol

518 2018-05-21 22:56:07 They keep using the same tactics because they keep getting away with it. Who has punished the US for the horror they inflicted on Iraq and its people? They went into Iraq- for oil. The truth is Iran recently dumped the $ for the Euro -
519 2018-05-21 22:56:05 I think you will find almost all leftists are opposed to saudi arabia and the current genocide your military is assisting them with along with invading Syria all expenses paid, purely for saudi and their oil.
520 2018-05-21 22:55:55 My man would use an oil. I had a natural birth and no tearing. It works
521 2018-05-21 22:55:50 Truck is the only option. The Oil companies are not going to let the BC government block a pipeline and then use/modify the OIL company facilities to offload barges....That is a lot of trucks. Tourism is going to take a major hit after Alberta shuts off the tap next week.
522 2018-05-21 22:55:39 Try diluted tea tree oil. Hope it gets better soon.

They're hiring in West Texas.
530 2018-05-21 22:54:57 It’s fine, I’ll just pivot into oil. Same thing, really.

534 2018-05-21 22:54:09 To moisturize I use Shea butter and this serum by @BahiCosmetics. It provides oil to your face without making you oily. I also do face masks and exfoliate twice a week.
535 2018-05-21 22:54:08 Having a socialist society based around oil (95% of exports) is a recipe for disaster. But then to makes things worse, corruption becomes ingrained and democracy smashed.
536 2018-05-21 22:54:06 $81 for an oil change and filter

619 2018-05-21 22:43:13 Encouraging people to “remember” 9/11 is convenient as a Trojan horse for perpetuating racist ideology and oil wars. Mass shootings, on the other hand, are an inconvenience to remember.
620 2018-05-21 22:43:10 Peeps have been saying the Keystone XL is for this exact purpose - tar sands now - WATER when needed - and other pipelines coming across the boarder - the only part that doesn't add up is once tar sands runs thru these-YUCK! but I guess-WATER is the NEW OIL in regard to value

And from the Cdn Royal Society too who are more impartial.

Plus we all know even crude oil on only recovers 15 to 20% typically.

Often the recovery might be worse for biodiversity like BP gulf incident.

673 2018-05-21 22:36:33 Oil rigs? Most are bases for wind turbines. They are beihg consructed there. Others are plarforms for drilling rigs. They have drilled and placed the wells. The wells are still producing.

676 2018-05-21 22:36:01 I don't. I live in Alberta in Canada. Which is as red a province as Alabama is a red state. When we voted a left government in for the first time in 40 years, we've actually been progressing and that government isn't caving in to big oil and constant slandering from the right.

695 2018-05-21 22:34:09 Any day now the analysts will look at @Craig_Hubley’s idea that posturing on #Northkorea, #Iran, #Palestine & #ParisAccord is entirely driven from Moscow.

It has alienated all US allies & put Putin in position to bat cleanup as regional power broker & trend setting oil pricer.
696 2018-05-21 22:34:09 US has a golden opportunity to liberate Venezuela from the chavista narco-genocidal nightmare, gain political appraisal from it and strategically secure steady flow of oil from the largest reserve on the planet. Polls in  have shown high approval if US military intervention..
697 2018-05-21 22:33:59 @agentdanaskully got me using an oil based cleansing stick followed by a water based cleanser. She's a skincare guru
698 2018-05-21 22:33:55 Right...and the price of each barrel of oil can go up based directly off what POTUS does or says. Like say, frex, violating the Iran deal, or even moving an embassy to another city, either of which actions might move a particular region known for its oil production closer to war.
699 2018-05-21 22:33:55 How long did it stay there for? Oil has not stayed for sub $40 for very long for over a decade. Even during the 2008 financial crisis, China was doing long term offtake deals w Brazil & Russia for way above spot price

705 2018-05-21 22:32:36 Butter was bad, eat this plant oil based spread instead they said. Oh and sugar.  Don’t eat fat! Turns out they were dead wrong. Hot tip, eat what you want, the less it’s been messed with the better 
706 2018-05-21 22:32:27 In current episode of Ingredients in Skincare that My Skin Hates: mineral oil. Paraffinum liquidum. Double cleanse daily but tiny bumps never seem to fade
707 2018-05-21 22:32:14 Don't you love it. Are the Democrats now to blame for these prices?  Goverment touts one of the largest oil reserves on Earth?
708 2018-05-21 22:32:11 Yeswe have got an amaxing @belazu_co olive oil at our #ExtraordinaryItalianTaste event. Actually the first one of our olive oil tasting!
#truetaste #icciuk #madeinitaly
709 2018-05-21 22:32:04 Surprisingly it is accompanied by soothing feeling like a masseur distributing oil around your back 
710 2018-05-21 22:31:55 Worked a nearly 10 hour shift, got a haircut, and getting my truck’s oil changed. Been a productive day
711 2018-05-21 22:31:52 Blah blah blah. OIL... of course is OIL. You can’t export beauty. And cocoa’s market is far to small... 
There’s no free lunch. I rather give it to cute Mickey Mouse than the bloody assasins of the Castro Regime & friends

713 2018-05-21 22:31:36 Where is #Oil?  Because that is the real reason for all of this
714 2018-05-21 22:31:31 Explain:
ANWR opening
Military spending all time high
Gas/Oil deregulation
If Trump was Putin's puppet no way he would take these actions. 
Please enlighten me. Thx.

716 2018-05-21 22:31:00 The government of Vanuatu has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Matthew Bellamy in a bobbinet wig.
717 2018-05-21 22:30:55 Honestly. A paste that is deep fried and retains oil is far from  cake
718 2018-05-21 22:30:47 You mean an oil industry insider... Or is he with big electrolysis?
Hydrogen is nice for rocket fuel and that's about it. Even there the future is mostly methane fuel because of hydrogen embrittlement making reusable engines hard to do, see space shuttle main engines.

725 2018-05-21 22:29:46 +Coming to Iran the debt left by UPA was $6.5 B (It is a common practice as everyone buys Oil & Gas on credit time and we still do) with the time line till 2016, UPA left with $310 B in forex reserve kitty. 
I rest my case!
726 2018-05-21 22:29:41 I screamed and I was sweating afterwards
727 2018-05-21 22:29:27 To the point of pharma companies, they are certainly bloodsucking, money hungry conglomerates. Without a doubt. The industry needs regulation like the oil industry did decades ago, but unfortunately it is not coming in this administration
728 2018-05-21 22:29:25 I need a oil connect here in Tacoma. Would loooooove to buy some bulk rosin / shatter 
729 2018-05-21 22:29:21 Mr. Dobbs, how about we unplug the deep State by unplugging 80-95% of the need for oil.  All cars/trucks on Natural Gas, leading to H2 with new engine (see tweets).  You know a lot of smart people.  Help me find the right people.  See pinned offer on my tweets.
730 2018-05-21 22:29:19 Nov 2004 petrol price was Rs 39 crude oil 36 $ , 2014 crude oil 97$ petrol price Rs 68 max so check ur facts first .. there was no dept of Iran due to US sans actions India was unable to pay money back to Iran it was with the Oil companies as the transactions are company to comp

737 2018-05-21 22:27:58 The New Zealand dollar should be the default world currency for Oil trading etc. It is unencumbered with huge military commitments. It is stable. The country is politically and economically stable. NZ is not at war with any country other than Australia.
738 2018-05-21 22:27:57 I think Europe is giving up the dollar to trade oil with Iran so it's a step in the right direction...

740 2018-05-21 22:27:40 Great. More divide. Nobody wins not even nature. The future of our Western Provinces depends on a merged future energy economy that brings together oil, renewables and conservation efforts to meet 2030 emissions targets. If California can figure this out, so must we.
741 2018-05-21 22:27:37 I just cleaned the entire house and kitchen and found oil all over the place. I hate living here. Wtf.
742 2018-05-21 22:27:35 Lol oh ik i just dont like working with oil
743 2018-05-21 22:27:00 You bet.Just addressing climate change with green energy would help the climate considerably but it's not going to touch rampant deforestation, palm oil, wildlife poaching, suburban & urban sprawl & fragmentation of habitat, overfishing. We need to address all these issues.#Ponzi

745 2018-05-21 22:26:51 Seriously! this your defence for high oil prices? Anyways Between 2004 to 2014 global oil prices increased by 150% (I am taking $100 as max) rupee was down by 30%, between 2014-2018 rupee is down 25%, for most part oil was Down by 60% expect this year (still down by 25%).+

751 2018-05-21 22:26:35 Women's bodies and souls are forcefully subjugated to ensure that the patriarchy feel safe and secure in their oil and blood soaked fallacy of an empire. They fear the power of women more than anything, because the female spirit will be their demise.#feminism #metoo #saudi

754 2018-05-21 22:26:35 You're so right! Recently I took my kitty 2 the vet & they saw arthritis on her xrays. Vet rxd Gabapentin rather than the usual Tramadol! I can't help but wonder if they accessed the PDMP. I WON'T give it 2 my baby & have been giving CBD oil. She no longer moans in her sleep etc
755 2018-05-21 22:26:32 Wait you and Russo on the same podcast???? Which of you is oil and which is of you is water? Might wanna talk to @ryansatin about Russo and his podcasts dealing with him..That think dragged on and not in a good way..

757 2018-05-21 22:26:28 2/2 - Pompeo's problem is the fact that his Saudi and Israeli pals think Iran is too big and too strong for their liking. Another Problem Pompeo has is the fact that Iran sits on a vast ocean of Oil and Gas and they are not willing to pay for American protection!

759 2018-05-21 22:26:12 The neem tree (from India) has the same chemicals we distill into oil and use in topical applications to defend itself from bugs and disease. It’s actually a pretty strong plant product.
760 2018-05-21 22:26:12 Look into cannabis oil...Rick Simpson oil. All over YouTube and articles online. Make your own or get it from a trusted source. (Lots of scammers in this too) Wishing you well! Prayers up.

779 2018-05-21 22:24:45 Let me know if it worked; for years I tried ANYTHING on my skin, but things were only worse. Coconut oil is the only thing I use now, for rashes, itching skin, makeup remover, even on my hair. I buy it at an organic supermarket; make sure is just coconut oil, nothing else.
780 2018-05-21 22:24:44 Church should rather give away the money it spends on converting Non-Christians. The oil prices will come down. #ChurchTargetsModi

787 2018-05-21 22:24:03 S/O to my mother for taking/paying for my oil change AND filling up my gas tank 
788 2018-05-21 22:24:01 And they are one of the main reasons why @POTUS has opted for regime change in Iran, to support this insanity.  We look like the biggest hypocrites int he world. But since Saudis accept dollars for oil and buy our weapons, their head-chopping is OKAY!
789 2018-05-21 22:24:00 That's because they do make up stuff to it. The syrup on pancakes is actually motor oil in the videos, and they are covered with a lay of gloss to reduce the amount of oil seeping into the pancake. Buns get similar treatment to make them glossy. Mayo is sometimes glue!
790 2018-05-21 22:23:44 Niggas use to tell me they don’t know how I’m even driving cuz my car should’ve gave out.. and if I don’t get it fixed I gotta sign something and begging and pleading to me... I would be their with the straight face like “nope I’m good just do the oil” 
791 2018-05-21 22:23:33 It's not the crude oil price which is responsible for the higher rates of petroleum in India, rather it's the tax which is levied on petroleum products. Earlier govt was also purchasing the crude oil on a much higher rate.
792 2018-05-21 22:23:31 Girl.  oil and gas/refining company. I shall not name names!
793 2018-05-21 22:23:29 They dont care about oil, drugs are much more profitable
794 2018-05-21 22:23:22 And sell the gasoline to who? We can’t build a crude oil pipeline. Who is she going to ship gas out?
795 2018-05-21 22:23:11 cleanser, exfoliate or face mask, toner, moisturizer, and a face oil once a week
796 2018-05-21 22:22:57 LOL nope! That’s pretty much all that goes into the dressing :) Unless you want something to help bind the oil to the juice then a scoop of mustard will do the trick (or a raw egg yolk if you’re brave) ;)

801 2018-05-21 22:22:00 Agree! Government support can reverse sluggish job markets & economies. With an upturn in the oil industry, perhaps offering industry-specific retraining programmes or courses can equip residents with skills for jobs in the sector, encouraging employment. #FD88miccheckyo
802 2018-05-21 22:21:57 Go me for waiting until I’m already past my miles for an oil change and can’t get in to an appointment before leaving for Moses Lake this weekend 
803 2018-05-21 22:21:41 Bitch this isn't well done, it's skipped straight to being crude oil.
804 2018-05-21 22:21:41 Hey @AceHardware @MarkZuckerman gonna need some more anointing oil, he’s just about out

806 2018-05-21 22:21:27 It’s cannabis oil, but it doesn’t have the THC in which is the hallucinogenic in cannabis itself. It doesn’t have the “high” affect on you and relaxes you and also helps a lot if you’re in any pain.
807 2018-05-21 22:21:17 You cannot convince an old person that putting soap and water doesn’t just make putting oil down the sink ok
808 2018-05-21 22:21:16 That's what the Iran thing is ALL about... OIL !!!
809 2018-05-21 22:21:07 “Oil Money” is a pitiful criticism. “Mansour has set up a footballing hedge fund in Beswick and lets City pick what they want from it for free” is painfully close to the truth. It’s a profit centre. But is that an entirely bad thing?
810 2018-05-21 22:21:02 ITT, people who are clueless about how the oil markets work.
811 2018-05-21 22:20:59 You have very little clue about how oil contributes to your lifestyle of ease.

813 2018-05-21 22:20:31 India is not going to stop buying oil from Iran just because Trump threw a temper tantrum.
814 2018-05-21 22:20:19 Oh, true Scanians would love to be Danish! They miss us! We'll have no problems whatsoever! Plus they need our oil to fly their planes and run their armour.
815 2018-05-21 22:20:18 That's exactly the situation here. Wood burners/fires aren't a luxury. Domestic oil is insanely expensive & we don't have gas. But also... We have extremely clean air & low LC so go figure...

831 2018-05-21 22:18:12 Who got the clean oil
832 2018-05-21 22:18:07 Naw prolly really wouldn’t push a pregnant girl down the stairs fr , but I’ll wait till she take a shower and cover the floor with baby oil and powder
833 2018-05-21 22:18:03 Guys, it’s completely possible to have a big beard and not look like a homeless person. A good set of clippers and some beard oil will do wonders for you.
834 2018-05-21 22:18:01 I'm slicker than oil baby ain't no playing NiqueeBugg 
835 2018-05-21 22:17:42 So first I rinse my face with Luke warm water
Then I use a neutrogena oil free acne wash cleanser, but when I rinse it off my face I use cold water  then I use just a drug store toner/astringent from big lots 
Then I use a target oil free moisturizer 
836 2018-05-21 22:17:33 like how lmao? you put it in oil or sum? or batter them and deep fry em? im confused
837 2018-05-21 22:17:27 Getting an oil change & my tires rotated 
838 2018-05-21 22:17:24 if you think I’m gonna chop my whole hand off just because I got a little bit of olive oil on it you are absolutely correct
839 2018-05-21 22:17:16 Who watches over to see if pollution is occuring? A state EPA. Wouldn't that be less efficient than a Fed EPA.
Also I propose that costs from harm caused by companies be paid out of the assets of the shareholders of that company. You spill oil, you pay all damages, murder or not.

Ignorance is not bliss...

Do not let race blind your ability to think.  Do not believe evrything a 'snake oil salesman' tells you.
845 2018-05-21 22:16:03 What does he know about patriotism?  He dodged the draft numerous times and fid nothing to aid this country. He’s a liar, a fake, a snake oil salesman!!
846 2018-05-21 22:16:01 Who would have thought a word meaning "anointed one" and another word meaning "oil used to anoint" would be related to each other.

849 2018-05-21 22:15:49 Eh, versus the billions of the oil and nat gas industry. No contest. Also, it would be the first worldwide coordinated hoax. Sorry man just not how it is.
850 2018-05-21 22:15:33 is the sequel video "How to euthanize yourself using clove oil only" coming soon?
851 2018-05-21 22:15:33 Chief White Halfoat isn’t that bad of a roomie, everywhere he goes we find a bunch of oil. I would he’s sort of a good luck charm for us
852 2018-05-21 22:15:30 You know , I am in big oil company and the best place in the corporate but still hate that routine job and status quo.
853 2018-05-21 22:15:19 I used to buy "Weekly World News" back when it existed, mostly for laughs. But that was more silly than it was tabloid news. Like the time they reported Satan escaped from Hell and killed 16 Mexican oil rig workers.
854 2018-05-21 22:15:19 Check your Transmission oil this Sunday.
855 2018-05-21 22:15:16 a dish best served with the freshest produce, great quality olive oil and presented alongside an amuse bouche of pickled vegetables, maybe a crusty loaf of bread?
856 2018-05-21 22:15:15 STFU? Nice, really classy. You haven’t a clue on economics and yes, who pays the bills in this country. Then we get shit on trying to get our oil to tidewater from many. So don’t you lecture me, because your province until recently has been on the governemt teat forever.
857 2018-05-21 22:15:05 “That ain’t a igloo that’s my watch, & that ain’t snow baby that’s my chain, that’s not a ice tray that’s my teeth & that’s not a snowcone that’s my Ring. That ain’t kool-aid in my cup, I stay slippin that purple oil..”
858 2018-05-21 22:15:05 And it will just get worse. The Kochs are boosting oil future prices through their ICE Brent exchange. We know Putin and OPEC reduced production last December.

863 2018-05-21 22:14:41 FFS I live in rural area ~ huge inglenook fireplace with mains no gas just heating oil. 
Bought a Clearview stove which is renowned for low tars ~ glass is always clean. Use only kiln dried logs and Homefire hot burning coke stuff - important to warm old 17c oak frame cottages!

867 2018-05-21 22:14:09 Took my car out the shop, just to have to bring it right back tomorrow for a oil change 
868 2018-05-21 22:14:07 Looks like u have purchased an oil well in kuwait now after Airlift. Now no more waiting in queues.
869 2018-05-21 22:14:02 When they ask "what currency will you use"?

Simply respond "What currency are you using to buy our oil, gas, water, whisky and farm produce... yeah.. that one"!

Soon shut those yoons up!

871 2018-05-21 22:13:44 Panamanians from Panama city are hardly conservative..from the country, or David they are.  That Canal has the same corruptive force as oil for the arabs.
872 2018-05-21 22:13:36 Don't think we get to dictate terms to bigger, stronger economies! Best guess at present is we'll be like Norway (without their oil money - Thatcher sold ours), waiting each week to hear what EU rules have been passed without our input which we have to follow to trade with them.
873 2018-05-21 22:13:31 Whew, waited 2.5 hours to get the oil changed in my moms Jeep.
874 2018-05-21 22:13:17 Where the oil at?
875 2018-05-21 22:13:15 Ummm..the NDP ran the AB economy into the ground and there was an upswing last year due to factors such as price of oil....nothing to do with NDP management of economy

881 2018-05-21 22:12:34 My dad got my oil changed for me
882 2018-05-21 22:12:32 just ordered some rosehip oil. 
883 2018-05-21 22:12:15 get you a pretty boy who ain’t afraid to get his hands dirty  just changed my own oil in the driveway 
884 2018-05-21 22:12:08 Why are you funding Izrael to dictate Palestine. So much about American dictatorship. We know like Venezuelans, that you again are looking for ekscuses, to steal oil from Venezuela. Like you did in Irak.
885 2018-05-21 22:12:01 Mike: Apparently they shut the turbines off if the wind speeds are too high.
Selina: Is it too late to turn them into oil derricks?  #Veep
886 2018-05-21 22:11:55 Glad to know how to change my own oil.
887 2018-05-21 22:11:48 I’m in no hurry...the oily New York snake oil salesman who has sucked you in is going down. He is only in this to enrich himself and his cronies. And I sit in wonder that 40% of you are too stupid to see it.

891 2018-05-21 22:10:48 I know it might sound weird but, for the rash, try some organic coconut oil. Just rub it on skin until absorbed. I have a freaking super sensitive skin and get lots of rashes and eczema due to stress/ allergies/ what not and the only thing that works is coconut oil.

895 2018-05-21 22:10:13 It is just funny to me that despite most presidents having little direct influence over the cost of gas at the pump, Trump's recent violation of the terms of the JCPOA (Iran Deal) will most likely cause a rather large increase in oil prices
896 2018-05-21 22:10:09 RT @LivingSafely: General Mills #Bugles this May? Its top four ingredients are corn meal, coconut oil, sugar and salt.

898 2018-05-21 22:09:58 Na so we see am brother. The people on top won’t see the bigger picture because they’re so engrossed in the little(which seems so huge) oil money.
899 2018-05-21 22:09:56 Pep boys broke something in my car while changing my oil so I’m making them pay for my Uber back to school 
900 2018-05-21 22:09:52 Almost 500 dollars later I’ve paid a ticket, tag renewed, and oil changed. I’m over adulting today 
901 2018-05-21 22:09:47 When people saying day and night government didn't doing  anything to poor on news channels government is finding money only on 3 things cigarettes ,drinks hot and cold, oil....when crude and oil are low government provide subsidy to poor by lpg free connection,subsidy.
902 2018-05-21 22:09:41 No oil rigs on our coast period.
It"s not about money folks  it's about humanity and pollution
903 2018-05-21 22:09:39 Palm oil free means saving our forests! Orang means people in Indonesian, otan means forest. Orangotans are 'people of the forests'.

906 2018-05-21 22:09:30 I agree, I am a natural optimist and I trust and hope the findings are sound.Just in the back of my mind I'm aware of publication bias. It's good news based on the fact it's the tastiest oil though. I've used it to cook for years ignoring everyone telling me it was sacrilegious
907 2018-05-21 22:09:14 You know it’s bad when you’re at an oil change location and they ask you if your car is a charger or challenger
908 2018-05-21 22:09:13 I think the oil I appied to the top of my head might have been a bit too hot because I can still feel the sensation of it after washing it off (it also had cinnamon in it), it felt almost like scalding myself but... comforting. It calmed me down.
909 2018-05-21 22:09:12 泉は選ばれなさそう(適当)
910 2018-05-21 22:09:12 The international oil prices today are roughly the same as in August 2009. But in those days, petrol in Delhi was Rs. 44.63. Today it's 76.57. Part of this increase is excise, and part is a donation from us to the impoverished oil companies and the party they are funding.
911 2018-05-21 22:09:03 Bio oil
912 2018-05-21 22:08:44 Sounds like "classic huckstering snake oil pulpit talk". Michael - redeem yourself by actually answering the question honestly. "When does the left go too far?" Was Moaist China too far? The Soviet Union? Start somewhere deeper than "violence".
913 2018-05-21 22:08:42 Lol now I aint lying i try to avoid changing my own oil
914 2018-05-21 22:08:41 Don't forget about 7.10! Celebrating the amazing existence of OIL! Check out all the deals we will be slanging that day.
915 2018-05-21 22:08:18 asked my brother to take my car to get an oil change cuz i don’t have time.... go home for my lunch and he didn’t do it... men suck at everything

918 2018-05-21 22:08:00 #DTG dropping off as Oil rises - could be linked. Did 13/21 day EMA Death Cross end last week - implies weeks of weakness. I don't hold.
919 2018-05-21 22:08:00 You had 8 yrs. What happened? 
Not your turn now.
920 2018-05-21 22:07:54 In under 2 years the price of a barrel of oil has gone up almost $25... The price at the fuel pumps has risen by over $0.50 a gallon... Not that any one of these politicians has ever struggled to fill their tank... So what does it matter right..??
921 2018-05-21 22:07:47 Who got the oil?
922 2018-05-21 22:07:26 The powder formula's unique & can be used 2 ways. It can be applied dry like a normal pencil for a natural matte look or moist for a bolder matte look. The soft powder formula's easy to apply/sharpen/remove. The pencil is waterproof & long-lasting. Suitable for all & oil free.
923 2018-05-21 22:07:15 Gotta love that Proactiv protection!  It’s like an invisible shield for oil and those dangerous UV rays. 
924 2018-05-21 22:07:14 It turned out much better than I thought. I hope I got the vinegrette right, I just mixed olive oil and lemon juice. I'm sure there's more to it but it still tastes fine.
925 2018-05-21 22:07:07 Nature provides sugar. Nature doesn't provide tofu, cheese, bananas, full fat greek yoghurt, olive oil etc. There has been a LOT of human intervention to get those.
926 2018-05-21 22:06:58 This peppermint oil & my deep conditioner 
927 2018-05-21 22:06:35 Yes, I'm guessing a midnight embargo is in place as I can find nothing about it. I did manage to read most of that and am sure rural/remote ppl will appreciate being told wood burners are a Middle Class problem rather than just cheaper than oil/electric heating.
928 2018-05-21 22:06:28 Mujur x sebut Arrogant Oil
929 2018-05-21 22:06:06 ud prolly have to see a dermatologist for meds but u can try like, taking hot showers or using compresses on the area to try and bring it up.  tea tree oil (it's kinda expensive but ime it lasts FOREVER) might also help, i use it on my acne and it helps clear up breakouts
930 2018-05-21 22:06:03 Jusso I got a sexy red man covered in oil in my head chanting 

"Bring my glide" 

931 2018-05-21 22:05:37 Tonight's attempt at bbqing.  Boneless pork chops with olive oil, salt and pepper.  In theory it should be tasty.  We shall see. #BBQ
932 2018-05-21 22:05:33 You guys are so sweet. Eating oil must taste so good.
933 2018-05-21 22:05:29 The US doesn't need Syrian oil.
934 2018-05-21 22:05:28 This made my day: I go to get an oil change and it’s pouring outside.. before I know it my mechanic runs out to me with an open umbrella and walks me into the shop 
935 2018-05-21 22:05:21 Haha no i mean they are rightfully champions. still bloody hate them.
Peps had to do nothing in his career worthwhile. Theyve spent £300M on defence alone in 2 years. He inherited a title winning team too. It'd be a crime if he didnt win. City are built on oil money. no history
936 2018-05-21 22:05:14 He was no oil painting, was he.
937 2018-05-21 22:05:09 In so far as I take a shit every day, sure. Why such a personal question. Are you constipated. Surely there's a vape for that? Prune oil?
938 2018-05-21 22:05:06 Rashad just asked me if my hemp oil is “weed juice”  wtf lol
939 2018-05-21 22:04:56 I've done salt. Can't imagine the oil though.

944 2018-05-21 22:03:56 #VenezuelaCrisis Was the Paris climate deal crafted to control the climate change or to create economic crises for Oil exporting countries by bringing slump in oil prices for a period.Venezuela economic crises further worsens by US sanctions. How far will that go?.@WW3Info

946 2018-05-21 22:03:54 It's important to understand the National Energy Board (NEB) has not yet approved this project.  It set requirements on the company, about half have been met.  The oil industry and politicians are setting this up as a national crisis when the project hasn't been approved.
947 2018-05-21 22:03:49 For one, oil will boil like water but the temperature is way higher than we normally have access to. Actually boiling oil is dangerous. For two, when we fry foods on oil, the bubbles we see are just water vapor from whatever we are cooking.
948 2018-05-21 22:03:39 it’s okay dude i was making taco shells and almost started an oil fire and almost burnt off my eyebrow
949 2018-05-21 22:03:33 NOTE TO SELF. Don't drink chili oil, ever again.
950 2018-05-21 22:03:32 Easily worth £75m so they better get that oil money out. Take £65m + Roberts that isn't. Bad deal...

Me: .......okay

955 2018-05-21 22:02:40 (for clarity. USA/UK overthrew a democratically elected Iranian govt in 1953 because they nationalised their oil fields. - the regime that was installed by that coup was itself overthrown in the revolution of 1979. - the US has been hostile to Iran ever since.)
956 2018-05-21 22:02:29 OMG . People r cray-cray. Talk about snake oil. Who would risk getting the dosage right for a pet? One born every minute.  LOL 
957 2018-05-21 22:02:28 Probably Keynesianism post oil crisis.

959 2018-05-21 22:02:06 Nothing really. The only difference is the advancement in technology. We have the tech to reduce pollution but choose not to use it as we are addicted to oil.
960 2018-05-21 22:02:03 He has very little understanding on how the oil markets work.  King Salman has way more stroke than Trump on oil prices.
961 2018-05-21 22:01:42 @JustinTrudeau Say no to Trump on pharmaceuticals. Canadians can't pay more. Republicans like Trump will not be content until they destroy Canada as we know it & impose their system, their values. They are taking over Canada through hedge funds & oil billionaires.

970 2018-05-21 22:00:17 the oil lobby doesn’t want you to know that we could harness the energy of people in DC complaining about their jobs on the phone with their parents at any given time to power our cars, our homes, entire cities
971 2018-05-21 22:00:02 Well he’s already a Gemini, shoulda did this castor oil on Friday cus doesn’t really make a difference at this point sis 
972 2018-05-21 21:59:59 #MYN next stop #WTI $75.  Cash . Onshore USA best place in the world to be an oil producer with crude rising. Low costs and multiple production increase potential.  One to buy hold and buy more.
973 2018-05-21 21:59:46 Too right it is .... Ive not had a cigg or joint since 4th feb and i finally got some cannabis oil yesterday im on it car bonnet .... its a creeper alright
974 2018-05-21 21:59:40 Yeah they are buying gold to back their own currency so it can be used to buy oil etc. Do not forget that there are downsides to being the global reserve currency.
975 2018-05-21 21:59:37 I use olive oil for the itching it works for me
976 2018-05-21 21:59:34 Nothing wrong with oil money
977 2018-05-21 21:59:33 Yea and look at the domestic gas prices soar. You really are helping out the little people. You do know that the US only received pennies for extracting that oil from public lands but corporations are making bank on it. After this and your Haspel vote you are a DINO for sure

980 2018-05-21 21:59:13 Your mechanic probably doesn't  have a few PhDs, like the engineers at JPL. However, I feel your pain (I drive a 7 year old Toyota... I really feel your pain! I don't think my mechanic has a PhD either. And if he did, he'd charge me even more for an oil change!)
981 2018-05-21 21:59:10 I've got £44m for Oulton to #RBD with the $55 oil price.

At $70 oil, that #RBD share is worth ~£95m!!!
982 2018-05-21 21:59:09 Thankyou! Not got either of them but I’ve got a coconut oil natural lip balm! So I’ll use that instead 
983 2018-05-21 21:59:02 It is beneficial for the US to destabilize the worlds biggest oil producer
984 2018-05-21 21:58:59 Yeah yeah yeah Always tell the truth never tell the whole truth ... same old tricks but the whole idea is about oil gas...economics and militaristic wars with the only goal of  Corporations domination
985 2018-05-21 21:58:55 If I have a favorite oil (I don't think I'm allowed to have a favorite, the others might feel bad), it is Fortune and Favor.  There, I said it. It has nothing to do with how well it works, I just like how it smells.

987 2018-05-21 21:58:37 The Saudi's dumped oil on the market in an effort to shut down American frackers. They failed and now they're close to broke.

I had given up on finding anything to help me and, I refuse to take pain pills. So, here I am 73 years old and can finally ride to see my grand kids again !! Thank you so much for introducing me to your product! 
995 2018-05-21 21:57:59 He’s a snake oil salesman, I don’t even think he believes what he spouts, merely a way to sell more of his shite self help books.

1006 2018-05-21 21:56:03 I think we're trying to buy back their shares in the oil refinery. Not sure how that's going.
1007 2018-05-21 21:55:48 The USA exports more oil than it takes in. Get your facts right! USA does not import nor need Iranian oil!!
1008 2018-05-21 21:55:46 @mathbabedotorg has been writing about the hype around big data and why data science often turns out to be snake oil. The gist of it is that human biases creep in wrt model selection and so forth. Lessons should have been learned after the GFC.
1009 2018-05-21 21:55:41 Good to have high quality, standardized snake oil
1010 2018-05-21 21:55:21 I would really like to see that plan. Oil prices are out of his hands so it has to be taxes cut on gas and made up somewhere else. He’s trump north. Dumb, power hungry blow hard

1014 2018-05-21 21:54:29 Gas always goes up in the summer. When we start utilizing our own oil it will go down.
1015 2018-05-21 21:54:28 I swear, popcorn and teeth just don't get along with each other. It's like oil and water. They just don't mix.

1026 2018-05-21 21:53:34 A lighter oil that won’t make hair greasy. Also a leave in conditioner that isn’t as heavy or put the other one in a bottle. Our hair can’t handle the entire packet.
1027 2018-05-21 21:53:34 Sure! But is he changing the oil completing to avoid engine knocking
We at Khalifa Meco PLC, we change it all thoroughly

1029 2018-05-21 21:53:15 Artist pals... how does one go about getting a print of an original oil painting? I have clients that have a house painting of their home and would like to make a print of it for their children… I’m not sure how that works… Would I get it professionally photographed perhaps?
1030 2018-05-21 21:53:14 getting an oil change.....i need food asap
1031 2018-05-21 21:53:03 There is no dairy in vegan cheese...it can be made with potatoes, carrots, extra virgin olive oil, nutritional yeast & seasonings
1032 2018-05-21 21:53:02 Oil providers drill for. We unfortunately have yet to come across any oil abundances that oil companies can use which is why oil prices are as high as they are.

1035 2018-05-21 21:52:38 Magandang Tuesday sa inyo from buddies! How are you today? I hope you feel good sa kabila ng napakalaking pagtaas ng oil price today. Hindi siguro ninyo napapansin na mula nung yearend ay 8.30 na ang itinaas ng presyo ng gasolina from 46.96 to 55.27 today.

1043 2018-05-21 21:51:20 Trump acts like he wants everyone to install coal fired furnaces in their homes & light them with oil lamps. Meanwhile places like Iowa are leading the country in making wind powered items to provide renewable energy.  Welcome to the 21st century while Trump reverts to the 1800's
1044 2018-05-21 21:51:18 Will def do. So far its looking like alot of cold pressed coconut oil, avacados, olives, cocoa and low carb greens

1050 2018-05-21 21:50:14 I don’t know if anything, but I haven’t done any research on it. I am sure there is oil, or sounds, or something that will help you. Have you tried meditation?
1051 2018-05-21 21:50:10 ...'funny' how the threat, by trumpUS, of "crippling oil #sanctions" on top of "the sweeping sanctions already imposed on the country by Washington." is not the 'headline'. (D_emocracy W_ith P_ersuasion)

1054 2018-05-21 21:49:52 @JosefSchachter Hello, Josef,
I heard you on Moneytalks yesterday and I have a question. You mentioned that the forward price curve has oil at 60 and 50 dollars one and two years out. Are you figuring that it will take oil two years to fall to 50? Please elaborate. Thanks!
1055 2018-05-21 21:49:44 Sanctions are not about citizens of Iran. It's about putying limits on a regime who created non stop content pain for people of Iran in past 3 decades and stretching its arms into other countries with letting them selling their oil and funding their evil desire.

1060 2018-05-21 21:49:26 They've always wanted the oil.
1061 2018-05-21 21:49:06 Absurd.

A country with oil that a few years ago was rich.
But the communists / socialists / liberals took power and did what they know to have done away with everything and enslave the people.

May this serve as learning for the unwary.

They are completely routed and left to hide in holes in the sand. They have no more territory. They have no more strategic assets like oil fields.

1085 2018-05-21 21:46:27 The BOGUS tax cut is going to BIG Oil w/gas price increases. Thank you Bogus Boy BS DT & his Fascist Rep buddies. Instead of hiking the min wage they play the shell game w/the American ppl. 43% of Americans can't get the essentials - that is completely pathetic.

1102 2018-05-21 21:43:11 Agreed ! I am so relieved about the Chinese bailout and also oil prices! #MAGA
1103 2018-05-21 21:42:52 I see you didn’t pass logic class. You don’t get them for the same price, you pay to six times as much. Crude oil prices aren’t set on a specific vehicle, never have been and never will. The specific vehicle cost will be gas mileage and cost / gallon. Silly analogy you must admit
1104 2018-05-21 21:42:39 We have over 200 years of coal reserves and over 100 years of oil reserves. Given the rate technology advances I think we’ll have transitioned off of those fuels long before they run out.
1105 2018-05-21 21:42:30 It's interesting... not so much as a historic biopsy as it is a low key detective story in oil paints
1106 2018-05-21 21:42:15 Don't be scared - #Scotland would manage fine. We're awash with resources and skills. We have renewable energy, tourism, whisky, oil, land, fishing, gin, agriculture, water, computer gaming industry, tech and software industry, tourism,....
1107 2018-05-21 21:42:15 @GlobalBC this is all over the U.S. oil corporations wanting control over Venezuela's oil...............
1108 2018-05-21 21:42:15 Well damn, now I know why I’ve been procrastinating making some soap.  I’m out of one of my oils!!  Of course I’ve already mixed the lye water. Luckily it should keep until I get some oil in, and I soap at room temperature anyway so I won’t have mess with it!   Gaaah 
1109 2018-05-21 21:42:07 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1110 2018-05-21 21:42:07 My mom just handed gabby her oil pen from across the restaurant table & said hurry up!!
1111 2018-05-21 21:42:07 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
1112 2018-05-21 21:41:52 Lol, okay then let me say this here, GEJ was a monumental catastrophe..wasted d oil boom on himself and cohorts...d oil bubble burst and b4 he left was owing salaries...PMB is clearly  not the Messiah he is a big let down but I will vote him one million times over a GEJ.
1113 2018-05-21 21:41:48 ur head get get oil
1114 2018-05-21 21:41:24 Good morning sa lahat except sa gobyernong korap na nagpatupad ng TRAIN Law kaya may inflation at oil industry kaya 50 per liter na ang diesel.

今日もイベントがんばっていきましょ→

1122 2018-05-21 21:40:26 Bruce Lee once said that every time El Trumpo abolishes a crucial regulation, a member of congress subscibes to the #NYT
1123 2018-05-21 21:40:22 What will be very interesting to observe is if the US sanctions Iran but it no longer 'works'. Oil sold for yuan. CIPS instead of SWIFT. We already have seen hints: Europe growing a backbone. I'm watching what other US shit list nations' reactions will be.
1124 2018-05-21 21:40:20 Yeah, but the oil industry is making money, lots of money!
1125 2018-05-21 21:40:14 おっぱいって結局は脂肪だろ？少し胸についてるからって僕を巨乳キャラにするなよ。
1126 2018-05-21 21:40:12 Yeah this CBD oil getting copped
1127 2018-05-21 21:40:10 I bought new deodorant and toothpaste, and finally got my car’s oil changed.
Guys, this is the most that I’ve ever had my life together.
1128 2018-05-21 21:39:51 Thanks for the reminder of the oil! I ended up needed to top up. I definitely would have been stuck wondering why it wasn't working.
1129 2018-05-21 21:39:47 Got more coconut oil, it's over for you hoes 
1130 2018-05-21 21:39:37 Yeah, that part where they're 'oil-rich' ignores that Venezuela can't just buy extraction expertise and sell their oil like any other country.

They're literally being choked by their competition and blocked from markets.  On top of the crash in oil prices.
1131 2018-05-21 21:39:31 this is a whole ass mood mine didn’t heal for a year but i put this lotion with tea tree oil in it on my face and it cUred it right away

1138 2018-05-21 21:38:40 The news is on in the oil change place and there has been more airtime of political ads than of actual news.
1139 2018-05-21 21:38:23 My mother is being groomed on Facebook by a scamming group posing as an American oil worker. They have stolen this dude's identity and are now 'woo-ing' my grumpy 75 year old Mum.
1140 2018-05-21 21:38:13 Make salad dressing! Mix 3 parts pumpkin seed oil with 1 part balsamic vinegar and 1 part avocado. Add thyme and coconut sugar to taste.
1141 2018-05-21 21:38:11 They all kind of look like that they all area overseas somewhere and usually in the military or with an oil company or some type of engineer. They all try to friend older women who don't have a relationship listed.
1142 2018-05-21 21:37:42 What?? Why??? What makes her any different is she made of gold, special powers on how to push! Oh it’s Pam not Crisco OR Crisco butter/ Pam olive oil!!! No yuk she’s has money. Greedy people, Help our VET’S! Impeach Trump.
1143 2018-05-21 21:37:38 So i was in an #uber and homie's car cut off... he pushed his car for 8 long blocks in traffic to a gas station and then i find out the dude's car had no gas or oil in... #pissed
1144 2018-05-21 21:37:32 Que gato decir; "tengamos sexo anal" cuando se puede decir; "cachorra, let me check your oil's level" (déjame checarte el aceite, para los del congalep)
1145 2018-05-21 21:37:31 The case against Trump must be seen thru, and new investigation must be instigated on trump's relation with oil tycoons! Trump is corrupt!
1146 2018-05-21 21:37:28 So you saying you don't agree that a ass like that should have oil covered on it! Lol
1147 2018-05-21 21:37:25 Boost body lotion with baby oil If you?re craving shiny legs that aren?t greasy.
1148 2018-05-21 21:37:07 Wow you fool! ISIS in daraa is in war with southern front. Never heared from that? Keep you bad and cheap lies. Assad is the one creating, supporting and using ISIS. Like in Idlib before. And maybe Erdogan, buying oil.
1149 2018-05-21 21:36:57 the combination of salicylic acid + rose hip oil + vitamin c booster... ugh iconic!
1150 2018-05-21 21:36:49 I use a bit of tarte shape tape for my dark circles but mostly just stick to laura mercier's oil free tinted moisturizer these days, and my skin has been real happy about it
1151 2018-05-21 21:36:33 Hey, café that told me you put peanut oil into all of your food, including the spaghetti and the scrambled eggs: congratulations, you got rid of me. Thanks for being a part of the problem, and making my day a little harder. #foodallergy
1152 2018-05-21 21:36:32 Actually it was due to falling oil prices and the dependency on it vs diversifying their economy. Not really socialism, remember correlation does not mean causation.
1153 2018-05-21 21:36:31 @RoseBacardi  I'm in the the same boat! This oil can be a blessing, being close Mayo Clinic & a teaching hospital. They work  the  front line of new treatments.

1156 2018-05-21 21:36:24 It’s a lot harder than you think to look like an intellectual when you’re reading comic books as homework while your oil gets changed. #URComicTerm

1158 2018-05-21 21:36:18 Cars are shit. Why did my teacher never tell me about cars. Fuck sex ed, tell me about oil and coolant sir.

1161 2018-05-21 21:35:41 No; they warrant an equivalent rise in purchases of new, more efficient aircraft (and cars for that matter)....everyone knows oil prices are going up....
1162 2018-05-21 21:35:10 RT @LivingSafely: General Mills #Bugles this May? Its top four ingredients are corn meal, coconut oil, sugar and salt.
1163 2018-05-21 21:35:09 Honestly, she may know. If you truly respect her then just try to honest AND COME WITH A SUGGESTION!!! Suggest lube or oil or something.
1164 2018-05-21 21:35:07 What EU companies will it sell to, because none of them want to go against the US.  And how is Iran going to get paid if China & India can't access the US banking system and pay them in dollars?  Yes they'll sell some oil (even ISIS manged that) but their profits will crash.
1165 2018-05-21 21:34:50 I like the way you lay it out. The top and bottom boxes are blending rapidly, but the right and left are still oil and water activities… you want them to mix better but don’t expect a smooth blend. Salad dressing comes to mind. ;)
1166 2018-05-21 21:34:32 yes @RachelNotley should be hauled up on charges of giving our resources to USA companies where they get 98% and Canada gets 2% royalties.
#KinderMorgan just pipes it Suncore and Syncrude get to keep the oil.

1173 2018-05-21 21:33:57 I oil up too 
1174 2018-05-21 21:33:43 Oh silly we’re not a country of laws, we’re an oligarchic oil company with an army that controls the government, illegal is just a word.
1175 2018-05-21 21:33:37 Do you ever know about oil and gas? The US knows about this long ago before it was discovered in the ME. They are in no hurry to leave. And Israel needs this O&G for their war machines too. The best oil is a stealing oil because it is free and cheaper to buy.
1176 2018-05-21 21:33:36 Prayers coming from her would be like an oil leak in an  old jalopy
1177 2018-05-21 21:33:36 Soak in buttermilk with some seasoning and then lightly dust with four and pan cook em in a bit of butter and olive oil. Then make a roasted jap and red curry pan sauce around em. Soooo good
1178 2018-05-21 21:33:33 I'm using a rental car while the Blubaru was getting her oil changed and like....I don't have to shift??? What do I do with my hands??? And my left foot??? #StickShift4Lyfe #ManualProbs

Instead of fighting, how about SOLVING the problem of OIL?  True "force" projection.  Save $500 Bil/y = Military budget

1187 2018-05-21 21:32:20 My new favorite habit is eating an entire link of sausage in the oil alone.
1188 2018-05-21 21:32:12 @dantriplett a single barrel of oil that was when president trump  gave the game away live on sky news right across america that said it all to me because he was right in what he was saying becuase  the american government  at the time was Bush j nr that sent in to Iraq  a search
1189 2018-05-21 21:32:10 Word on the internet has it that Iraq began settling oil trade with Europe in Euros circa -02. That ended poorly. Now Iran? Days like these I want the alien superpower police.

1202 2018-05-21 21:30:48 "While the temptation is to associate this relationship with inflation expectations, we believe that this is not credible explanation. we believe that bond markets reacting to an anticipated flow shift caused by the rise in oil prices is a more credible explanation."
1203 2018-05-21 21:30:46 Trump and GOP policies have created  a strong economy which in turn raises demand on oil.  NOT your incoherent list.

1218 2018-05-21 21:29:23 People notice Putin has rebuilt Russia, has a Jewish family, ignores Palestine, invites Natanyahu to the Red Square celebrations, ignores Assad for an oil pipeline, military/naval base in the Mediterranean, allows Jewish Oligarchs to escape to the West with dubious Russian funds.

1222 2018-05-21 21:28:56 Dept of Interior is giving national parks over to oil, mineral, and cattle interests, AG Sessions has ordered Justice to consider police killing "local issues" and not intervene, and a Taliban-like religious movement is imposing it's theology on everyone.

1224 2018-05-21 21:28:47 I’m not complaining or bashing here. Just a statement. I recorded the all-star race and went to Deer Creek Speedway for Lucas oil race. Dirt race was awesome!!!!  Great race!  Didn’t watch the whole All-star race. Dirt racing was just to good Saturday night!!

1226 2018-05-21 21:28:33 @dantriplett but the real reason you invaded it wasn't to kill sadam Hussein and take his gas and oil of him because America  spent 3.5 trillion dollers and you heard what president trump  said over 3 trillion dollers  spent fighting the Iraq war and we didn't take
1227 2018-05-21 21:28:24 Oops, meant still*

I do not believe that Gartman was selling oil. I think he was definitely long. There have been far too many times where the market has gone parabolic when he’s made a call. I think he’s exceedingly clever.

My husband encourages me to drive manual again & teaches me about cars & bc of the positive teaching, I changed my own oil by myself

1233 2018-05-21 21:28:03 From what I've read ...

russia: needs higher oil prices bc economy is sucking wind

SA:  this gives them excuse it wanted to develop nuclear weapons (and they always want higher oil prices)

Israel: Bibi is in political hot water in Israel and needs a "threat" to deflect.

1243 2018-05-21 21:26:35 PSA don't use olive oil as lube
1244 2018-05-21 21:26:15 Man, that’s an oil change
1245 2018-05-21 21:26:09 That’s because terror is a business. 9/11 was about oil, nationalism, and approval ratings in the WH among other things.

1250 2018-05-21 21:25:52 a man needs his olive oil
1251 2018-05-21 21:25:51 Could you please do something to make the oil companies stop being able to sell the oil overseas. The gas prices are going sky high again.
1252 2018-05-21 21:25:45 What’s the point of an auto parts store if they don’t have the oil filter for your car in stock?
1253 2018-05-21 21:25:33 If you have a serious illness you don’t go to snake oil salesman promising miracles convincingly. That’s a quick way to die. You find someone else. Find. An. Alternate.

1259 2018-05-21 21:24:46 i just bought a whole new thing of the flaxseed , castor oil eco styler gel . that shit was 7$ . ima use it till its gone
1260 2018-05-21 21:24:37 @sullivanradio @realDonaldTrump  Looks like China has agreed to buy more of our Oil, rare earth metals, gold, silver, platinum, hi-tech, vegetables, meat, raw land, farms, U.S. companies, industrial equipment, technology and we'll continue to buy their cheap useless crap, yay,
1261 2018-05-21 21:24:25 @majorian459 Now that the gas is well over 3/gallon, who is getting rich in a slush fund on gas. I can't of anyone other than Trump behind this give away to the oil industries globally!
1262 2018-05-21 21:24:19 Yard work did not make me less sad today and I still don’t understand a 50.1 oil/gas ratio in a weed wacker.
1263 2018-05-21 21:24:07 Right on the money. With a holy oil rub at the end.
1264 2018-05-21 21:23:49 Yeah i used to experiment a lot during my drawing days with ink dip, oil pastel, water color, etc. I had these tools cuz i was in magnet art school... But I'm hella rusty now

1267 2018-05-21 21:23:40 There's absolutely NO reason to build a floating nuclear reactor, except to have it meltdown off your enemy's coast and pretend it was an "accident". No offshore oil rig, for example, requires enough energy to have its own reactor.
1268 2018-05-21 21:23:30 It's outrageous that cannabis isn't legal. Britain is the worlds biggest producer of medical cannabis. You may be able to find a local grower who could help you out with some oil, it's easy to make, but expensive to produce any quantity.
1269 2018-05-21 21:23:29 I have an essential oil bracelet and I love it!! I put my Creative Thinking oil on it.
1270 2018-05-21 21:23:19 So a meeting with foreign nationals who agreed to sell shares of an oil company meeting with the recipient of said shares is grasping at straws. I dunno bud...Qatar is far from New York.

1276 2018-05-21 21:22:28 It's lucky Modern Olives Laboratory Services- didn't find any other oil was the best, may have been embarrassing for them to say the least 
1277 2018-05-21 21:22:28 I agree Sainsbury's products are generally some of the best regarding certified palm oil , however these are the basic biscuit products in their range.

1285 2018-05-21 21:21:12 There will be no more oil booms. It’s an industry of diminishing returns, which in a capitalist society, is its death knell. Plus it needs to die, it’s destroying the biosphere.

1291 2018-05-21 21:19:46 Yes our company @tvi_vision made it  - we’ve made similar films about Paisley (Thread), West Lothian (shale oil) and building of original Forth road bridge...

1301 2018-05-21 21:18:37 Of all the 3 macros, which increases the chances of fat storage? Which, in the presence of excess cals, will lead to most fat storage? Perhaps earlier there wasn't enough consumption to matter which macros were eaten. Add in cals from meat and veg oil plus insulin & there you go.
1302 2018-05-21 21:18:34 Jason , u do realize oil was fairly recently under $44.  Seems like there are still plenty of oil companies around

1306 2018-05-21 21:18:16 Brand and type. There is Dark Sesame oil and Pure. I think Dark Sesame is made from roasted sesame oil, which accentuates the flavor. Start with half the amount in the recipe and go up from there.
1307 2018-05-21 21:18:06 ¡Ja! Eso no es anda. El gas oil en la Argentina tiene un componente impositivo de 60%. Las naftas (gasolinas) andan por el 50 y pico %...
1308 2018-05-21 21:17:41 Hey @realDonaldTrump you are doing a great job—for the oil companies! Just drove home from work and saw a bunch of stations priced at $3+ per gallon. #MAGA?!

1309 2018-05-21 21:17:37 It's not splitting hairs to differentiate between Islam & Saudi Arabia. Islam is a 1400 year old religion focused on service to God & all humanity—KSA is a political draconian regime built on oil, corruption, & western military support

The two couldn't be more unlike each other.

1318 2018-05-21 21:16:41 Id rather we get of oil completely, but that aside, who is in Canada's oil patch?   Big Oil  (ExxonMobil, ConocoPhilips, Shell, Murphy, Devon, Koch) and firms with major foreign ownership (Esso Imperial, Nexen, Suncor, Husky).
1319 2018-05-21 21:16:40 Hope you all don’t drive , fly , take cruises , appreciate our military .. oil isn’t great but is needed at this time .. the offended 99% need less idol internet time

1323 2018-05-21 21:16:28 Idk. It's still possible. I still haven't discounted the view that we could have a rapid run up in the price of oil followed by a sharp crash.
1324 2018-05-21 21:16:16 For decades the Foreign corporate Mission has been to pull YOU into a  perpetual war that allows the OWNERS of OPEC to bankrupt America and the world with the price of their OIL . (Iran and Iraq ignored OPEC and sold their oil CHEAP to anyone who asked for OIL
1325 2018-05-21 21:15:57 @AJEnglish can you please repost the video about Venezuela's history? My husband believes the BS about Chavez & Maduro not creating a diversified economy! Nobody cared when the oil giants OWNED Venezuela!
1326 2018-05-21 21:15:48 Are you sure? Listed on Sainsbury's website as "Palm oil – certified sustainable (segregated)", although I know the certification scheme is far from perfect. From a health point of view, I'm glad they haven't replaced palm oil with dreadful hydrogenated vegetable oils.
1327 2018-05-21 21:15:47 I think cannabis would be more effective. Topical salve for the inflamed area and oil for the pain. A friend is doing this and is no longer taking Tramadol, Paracetamol, Diazepam and sleeping tablets. A total 128 less tablets per week, no side effects.
1328 2018-05-21 21:15:41 Eco Styler, Shea butter products and jojoba oil.

1358 2018-05-21 21:11:26 Is Maduro entirely to blame for Venezuela's economic disaster? It's not so simple. Maduro in fact doubled down on Chavez's policies despite low oil prices; and Chavez for his part took past policies (statism, authoritarianism, and bread-and-circuses populism) to new heights.
1359 2018-05-21 21:11:25 @POTUS So the nice tax break we all got is now going in the gas tank. 2 months ago the US was “flush” with oil. Tired of the oil game. Middle class never gets ahead....

1367 2018-05-21 21:10:44 my only issue is the cost of medical cannabis, especially the cannabis oil, i'm poor, can only afford 1/3 of my prescription.

1374 2018-05-21 21:10:07 When does oil become a market negative? I’ll say $90.
1375 2018-05-21 21:10:07 知ってる？大学って大して重要じゃないんだよ。焦ってる暇あったら油、飲も？
1376 2018-05-21 21:10:06 If we took all the money it spends on the oil industry and put it into clean energy it would create jobs, and Canada could become energy independent within a decade. The oil industry controls the government, and popular opinion, so it's impossible to do that.
1377 2018-05-21 21:09:59 Lavender oil is my miracle oil. Sliced my finger open once (by accident), next day hardly even a sign I'd done it. Also, of course, great for sleep, anxiety.. And all rashes and scratches and bites and eczema. It's brilliant.

1383 2018-05-21 21:09:26 If oil prices rise Venezuela can tell sanctioneers to stuff-it. The biggest chunk of Venezuela's problems came with plummeting oil prices by more than 50% . Nothing to do with Bolivarian economy management. More like dastardly fracking overproduction .

1389 2018-05-21 21:08:41 You think investing in clean energy options would sacrifice the economy, when the opposite is true. Not only the financial gains there, but getting off of oil that we literally buy from the same people propping up Islamic terrorist groups, would be another plus.
1390 2018-05-21 21:08:40 The new penalties, which would bar United States companies or citizens from buying debt or accounts receivable from the Venezuelan government, including Petróleos de Venezuela, the government-owned oil company that is the parent of Citgo Petroleum Corporation.

1394 2018-05-21 21:07:45 I like sesame oil, but I find the flavor exceptionally strong when I use it in the quantities listed in recipes. Is that a function of brand/quality or just my taste buds

1402 2018-05-21 21:05:35 Had 'loads' to do today but all I did was get my eyebrows done and drown every part lf myself in coconut oil Im actually so annoying

1406 2018-05-21 21:05:13 I categorize Fry's rhetoric of "snake oil huckster pulpit talk" as incredibly more ad hominem than "angry white man". Dyson's response was on-topic against the "anti-PC" right by pointing out the history of labeling educated black men as "condsecending" or "hucksters".
1407 2018-05-21 21:05:13 Mom shaming for giving a kid antibiotics a for an ear infection? What?

1409 2018-05-21 21:05:09 people keep asking why i have an essential oil diffuser in my office. i don't have the heart to tell those people it's because they keep coming in here while wearing axe or drakkar noir or some shit and i need to continuously cleanse the air

1414 2018-05-21 21:04:54 Lavender oil. You probably don't have it in the house, but get some in, for next time. It'll seal it up quick and hardly any scab either as it heals x

1459 2018-05-21 20:59:41 Ivan made his money selling oil to a sanctioned apartheid government. Money which funded glencore. They then purchased SA's oil stocks at discounted prices as 'copayment' for Optimum  Mine. They are beyond dirty.

1469 2018-05-21 20:58:29 A responsible government will recognise the need to move away from oil & gas in the future and will plan now giving communities years to plan, prepare & adjust. Given that the announcement included a timeline of 40-50 years I’d say that is plenty of time to consult & adjust.
1470 2018-05-21 20:58:04 It's any fish caught near the bonga oil field.
1471 2018-05-21 20:57:44 nah, i doubt its your luck. i went for an oil change and then i come home and all of a sudden my cars leaking and i need my water pump replaced. they try and get you however they can. now i’m scurd to get an oil change lol

1473 2018-05-21 20:57:35 So you'd actually risk being held hostage by the US or middle east for our oil needs as has happened in the past. Let's at least get self sufficiency.

1487 2018-05-21 20:56:07 Guess your idea of success is different then mine. Youre entitled to your opinion. I prefer Trump's 3.3% growing economy; less regulations, tax cuts, US increasing military strength, no Iranian deal, possible talks with NoKo, arming Ukraine, fracking increase in US oil and more
1488 2018-05-21 20:55:59 As long as all the units are being engineered from state house, this is dololo. Conflict of interests is inevitable. The unit will inevitably  be used for politically   silencing  others. Executive, judiciary and parliament are like oil and water. They should  work independently

1501 2018-05-21 20:53:38 The administration is taking some steps to prevent Maduro’s cronies from profiting on the sale of state assets – but we shouldn’t stop there. The U.S. should prohibit the importation of Venezuelan oil until constitutional order there has been restored.

At the office nursing a mug of hot coffee between my palms and now realize I am a human aroma diffuser. I am literally pulsing out a heavy scent of lemongrass. My coffee smells like lemongrass.

1518 2018-05-21 20:50:35 Slight flaw on your poster. I am sure they said in court that Fracking was not actually banned. The irony is economic forecasts produced by SNP are heavily dependent on oil, worse for the environment than shale gas. But don’t let facts get in the way of a good sound bite.
1519 2018-05-21 20:50:19 Trump's Iran decision 7 May 2018,.
Oil prices surged to their highest levels since late 2014. They have leveled off since then

May 1 2018 local price is $2.50 per gallon reg
May 20 2018 local price 3.29 gal reg to 2.81 gal reg.  Diesel from 2.80 to 3.49 highest price noted.

1524 2018-05-21 20:49:03 It is no coincidence that Irag, Lybia, Syria, Iran and Venezuela have been derided and mistreated by US. 
Why ?
The answer is very simple: They all decided to stop using the dollar for selling oil. Recent wars and sanctions by US are directly linked to retaining the petrol dollar

1536 2018-05-21 20:46:50 I don’t expect them to be sensible sensible.  I’m expecting an incredibly spiteful Westminster after they lose the oil, renewables and such.  I also expect them to fund campaigns to get Scotland to rejoin the rUK.

Quiet a time consuming process - but I like the result and didn’t find a quicker way up to now!
1545 2018-05-21 20:46:13 I’m not really a Trump fan either, but I don’t think He has had anything to do with it. Gas Prices and Oil Market with the addition of Gas/Oil companies are highly Volatile. It’s just something we’re going to have to deal with, and the addition of state taxes don’t help.
1546 2018-05-21 20:45:53 @realDonaldTrump help us! The working American is suffering with the high gas prices! Why should they be so high with the kind of profits the oil companies make? Can the government control this? I own a landscaping company and the spike in fuel cost is hurting my profits...

1570 2018-05-21 20:42:19 Actually this is more oil exploitation than oil exploration.
1571 2018-05-21 20:42:03 Try to just rinse your body if you feel like you’re sweating a lot!! Dermatologists say the average American washes their body too much n interrupts their natural oil levels n things like that!

1575 2018-05-21 20:41:22 Sometimes the truth hurts. But as Leaders in this modern energy era, it is our tireless duty to not insult but to understand. We must bring everyone together and dovetail oil & renewables & conservation into one forward looking plan to meet or exceed 2030 emissions targets.

1633 2018-05-21 20:34:09 4-  U.S. imports from Venezuela totaled $ 10.9 billion, down 30 percent from 2015. Crude oil dominates U.S. imports from Venezuela, which is one of the top  five suppliers of foreign oil to the United States. U.S.FDI in Venezuela is concentrated largely in the petroleum  sector.
1634 2018-05-21 20:34:01 Aspiring artist?  You can apply some baby oil to the skin and wash it all away with soap and water. The oil will help gently loosen the pigments and the soap and water will wash it all away. Hope this helps your little Picasso!
1635 2018-05-21 20:33:56 Wow! We're learning new lessons in history! Suddenly from May 2014 our oil suppliers became Wahhabis! Maggi takes the cake in bigotry.
1636 2018-05-21 20:33:52 Nissan of Lake Charles so full of it. Tryna finesse me out of extra money. I go for a simple oil change and they talkin about they cant change my oil unless they fix this,that, and the other first. Yall tried it.

1653 2018-05-21 20:30:12 Or as the Shell did, bribe a local anti-Dutch militia to get a permit to build a oil drilling rig, and cajole the Dutch colonial government for permission to build a pipeline to an existing refinery 200km south. I shit you not

No it is poor because Chavas, nationalised PDVSA.

There was rthen a purge of none Socialists from the company

Also PDVSA profits were used to finance welfare & Gov spending

Thus starving PDVSA of money to invest & increase efficiency & cut jobs per barrel of oil produced
1656 2018-05-21 20:29:54 Summer blend and market reaction to Trump pulling out of Iran deal sent oil prices higher temporarily.
1657 2018-05-21 20:29:39 They take forever changing your oil when you hungry
1658 2018-05-21 20:29:32 I literally take off my makeup and put on my face oil and pull my hair up to go to work 10/10
1659 2018-05-21 20:29:31 And boiling oil. Kept ready at all times.
1660 2018-05-21 20:29:18 Because of the dysfunctional decision on the Iran deal that benefits Russian oil.

1665 2018-05-21 20:28:29 In exchange for how much oil????
1666 2018-05-21 20:28:25 An oil refinery in the U.K. that worked for was designed to process crude from Venezuela . 15 years ago the government in Venezuela stopped investing in their oil industry. Supply became unreliable. Alternative supply was found in Russia.
1667 2018-05-21 20:28:07 Buddy I am sure your hatred for our PM will make you overlook every good thing about him . So the road construction that is all time high needs money which comes from oil. In previous government you were charged high but there was hardly any construction.
1668 2018-05-21 20:28:06 It is a complete mystery to me as Venezuela with the highest oil reserve in the world how is it so poor and backwards. The should follow the example of Saudi Arabia how to use create the oil wealth and use that for the good of its people.
1669 2018-05-21 20:27:59 You’re a 2000AD droid now, you get your oil rations just like the rest, and as we all know Mek-Quake deals with intruders and imposters. So you’re doing great.
1670 2018-05-21 20:27:55 Come in real handy for oil changes tho.
1671 2018-05-21 20:27:51 AFTERNOON MARKET WATCH: Dow climbs 298 points, closes above 25,000 for the first time in two months. Easing trade tensions with China lift Boeing and Caterpillar. Oil prices jump 1% to top $72 a barrel. ~ M

1684 2018-05-21 20:25:59 @jiffylube been using you guys forever. Today I bring in a coupon - mgr says that’s not our franchise coupon.  So after it’s all said & done instead of honoring the coupon (& done oil chg) they just do the entire oil change over, dispose the initial oil chg. So stupid! Wasteful!
1685 2018-05-21 20:25:54 Honest work. Not selling America to Russia or oil moguls.
1686 2018-05-21 20:25:44 sounds like a lot of work, then you press the plant or just the flowers for oil?
1687 2018-05-21 20:25:40 Any recipes which include yogurt or cream are good/better than straightforward sponges or anything with oil - the batter looks terrifyingly runny sometimes but always ends up moist!
1688 2018-05-21 20:25:30 Put some castor oil in your mascara.
1689 2018-05-21 20:25:20 I found the same with my op scars. Rose hip seed oil is a good un for them too.
1690 2018-05-21 20:25:18 Sometimes when I’m writing I think, no that’s not plausible enough. Then I remember there was a very successful film about a bunch of oil riggers rapidly trained to be astronauts, sent into space to blow up a meteor. Then I stop worrying.
1691 2018-05-21 20:25:12 Shouldn't that mean WTI goes down with it? I don't want to mention anything here in case you put something in the notebook (I'm checking now). Let's hope this shitty move up in WTI dies quickly tomorrow and Wednesday :)

1694 2018-05-21 20:24:58 I also do not agree that Nutella should be a superfood. It might be tasty, but it’s got palm oil in it, and superfoods don’t exist, anyway #nosuchthingasnatural

Olive oil and vinegar to season and YUM 

Also, wraps are always a good option too!
1697 2018-05-21 20:24:28 Maybe do something about gas taxes at the pump?  Gas prices in Oregon are making life unbearable.  And it isn't the fault of oil companies.  It's the fault of local politicians adding 50 cents to the gallon at the pump.
1698 2018-05-21 20:24:25 CAD is not a emerging market currency, and it is heavily dependent on the price of crude oil. Currently, USDCAD is selling off like the other FX pairs.

1771 2018-05-21 20:15:56 ESSENTIAL OIL ENTHUSIASTS:  Our Young Living Diffuser died.  Is there any real reason I shouldn't order a replacement on Amazon for $15 instead of paying roughly $1,000,000 for one from the magical potion company?
1772 2018-05-21 20:15:52 Fresh Homemade orange fried chicken, marinated in the dough with a little late but not let the sauce pan with oil and let
1773 2018-05-21 20:15:49 Yes and Justin doesn’t answer impose carbon tax  in that US oil.  Just on 
1774 2018-05-21 20:15:37 the shampoo i've been using has peppermint oil - which i've mentiond before when i tweeted about my hair smelling of mint vienetta - but it also makes my scalp tingle and it's better than ASMR imho
1775 2018-05-21 20:15:36 Oof, that's hardcore :/
My suspicion is that it's not abnormal nor threatening but just needed reassurance. Still gotta check with docs and I'll look into bio oil too.
1776 2018-05-21 20:15:33 Thank you for your response. Glad you liked it xD
Thinking about making a better ai and exploring combinations of tool already in the game, like mines you can plant on objects or damaging oil barrels, so they start leaking to set enemies on fire xD
1777 2018-05-21 20:15:31 Never knew Nigeria was this hard until i saw her eating bread with anointing oil...he even prepared eba wit akamu water
1778 2018-05-21 20:15:30 Whenever I stop using avacado oil my skin starts to break out. I'm just gonna take that as a hint and stock up for the rest of my life
1779 2018-05-21 20:15:08 Today the @SFDAOffice received a $35k settlement from @BGFleet for a ~7 gallon oil spill in the #SFBay on September 11, 2017. This $ will help finance future environmental crime law enforcement investigations.

1782 2018-05-21 20:14:49 NPR is mainly funded by British Petroleum, a mortal enemy of Venezuelan oil sovereignty
1783 2018-05-21 20:14:46 Damn, next thing you know @KEEMSTAR is gonna influence the oil prices. Or the war in Syria.
1784 2018-05-21 20:14:33 canola oil ain’t dead 
1785 2018-05-21 20:14:28 So are you bragging that you've sold your souls to the NRA and big oil or is this your admittance of Shame?
1786 2018-05-21 20:14:20 Crude oil x Arab money
1787 2018-05-21 20:14:20 Coworkers think they’re slick when they don’t want to do any work. Nah. I’m slicker than baby oil between butt cheeks. You can’t go over 
1788 2018-05-21 20:14:14 man why am i nauseous all of a sudden

1791 2018-05-21 20:14:05 Please chief Garba kindly help Nigerian tell baba to return $25 billion oil contract and return presents subsidy money after increase of 145
1792 2018-05-21 20:14:05 I gave my baby a bath, wash and deep condition, little Bantu buns, a oil foot rub, painted her hands and feet, put on Sophia the First and made her a smoothie she’s at her happiest right now
1793 2018-05-21 20:13:55 And taking their oil.
1794 2018-05-21 20:13:53 No, they probably wouldn't, if the goal is to control Iran's remaining oil reserves.
1795 2018-05-21 20:13:50 I’m just waiting for Gartman to say it won’t drop below $70 in his lifetime to go all in short. You know we are getting close to an oil long watershed call by him.
1796 2018-05-21 20:13:38 Yeah (sorry) my operation scars were itchy and bumpy for about 7-8 years on and off.... settles slowly depending on location and your skin (I found bio oil helps but I’d check with the Dr before using anything)

1800 2018-05-21 20:12:51 Oil below $44 would bankrupt all the national oil companies & a lot of the private sector producers. The national oil companies are infamous for waste, fraud, corruption & abuse.
1801 2018-05-21 20:12:45 I’m too tired to fully tweet but let me gas my brother small. This boy ordered pizza for dinner, but not just any ‘pizza’, Sicilian pizza with the chilli ‘infused’ oil.
1802 2018-05-21 20:12:43 my stepmom got me a lavender esstial oil bracelet and i had it on for 20 mins and passed out for three hours
1803 2018-05-21 20:12:35 Has energy policy been influenced? No doubt. A retrenchment of gas mileage standards. A torching of renewable energy incentives. Scuttling the JCPOA will remove Iranian oil from the market. Oil prices have been rising - and economists say prices will spike further as a result.
1804 2018-05-21 20:12:34 Nope, because these are the same people that told us if we didn't act immediately in the early 2000s that NYC would be under water by 2014.... Been to NYC lately? Did it become Venice? - But please feel free to completely purge yourself of oil and plastics if you feel the need.
1805 2018-05-21 20:12:27 Me: *grabs donut* Go ahead. Take one.
Vegetarian friend: idk Are they fried in vegetable oil?

1806 2018-05-21 20:12:22 He did the gesture politics stuff like buying Venezuelan oil but most of it was practical policies like the congestion charge. You don't get to nationalise everything as mayor though
1807 2018-05-21 20:12:02 Oil city
1808 2018-05-21 20:11:55 Got myself a bottle of castor oil for hair but why does it say suitable for constipation and mix with warm milk or fruit at bed time for better results????!?!!?!????!?
1809 2018-05-21 20:11:50 And actually, I was asking a precise question. What exactly has the USA done ?  Let's remember that (eg) Costa Rica can feed everyone and have a welfare state without the oil riches that Venezuela's got.
1810 2018-05-21 20:11:48 And while you're looking this way...Big Oil is slowly assembling another big hurt your way.
Have you seen a family man reach for $85+ to fill his goddamn gas tank lately.
It's total bullshit...and you and I both know that.
Tend to that for a while. Growing importance Big League.
1811 2018-05-21 20:11:43 coconut oil? on cooking?
1812 2018-05-21 20:11:40 I like my woman how I like my fish oil, with fatty acids.
1813 2018-05-21 20:11:36 I got all these spices to try and make an Indian dish while Mom’s out of town but I’m also thawing chicken thighs 

I *could* try to make it with broccoli or use these fingerling potatoes I was gonna use to make smashed potatoes with truffle oil.....
1814 2018-05-21 20:11:02 MONDAY thin trade session run down; Equities up, Treasuries down, USD flat, Oil up.
1815 2018-05-21 20:11:00 No. Am not saying we do not have demand.. We have a high demand it's obvious with increasing population.. It is just my opinion that if oil prices are less then we should not have increase in price.. Let's keep it same. So the balance is justified..
1816 2018-05-21 20:10:53 Tax payers should not be paying to feed other countries by growing crops at a loss while those countries take our jobs,charge high tariffs and rake us over the coals for oil,they need our food! Why should the elected and connected get rich with kick backs at our expense,
1817 2018-05-21 20:10:44 Jesus said "because of the increase of lawlessness the love of many will grow cold but he who stands firm to the end will be saved"    Have you noticed that lawlessness is increasing? It's all over the news and getting worse. Jesus is coming soon. Watch and keep oil in your lamp.
1818 2018-05-21 20:10:43 Does cooking the broccoli alter those benefits? We love to throw some avocado or olive oil on it and bake in the oven or on the grill!
1819 2018-05-21 20:10:20 …ぐぅ
1820 2018-05-21 20:10:16 Yes, my mom never ever purchased margarine because she said they put chemicals in it to Artificially make it a solid –Cold pressed virgin olive oil and butter are the only ingredients I ever use. Lately, –Some butters not tasting right.  I’m thinking they’ve added some crap to it
1821 2018-05-21 20:10:09 *goes onto restaurant website*
"We use extra virgin olive oil and corn oil not lard and butter"

1823 2018-05-21 20:09:58 So some sickhead in the home office says the kid must die/have epileptic fits for life and its ok? Because they cant take something that grows in the ground and has few if any side effects (CBD OIL). Literally getting away with murder
1824 2018-05-21 20:09:56 The oil rich country/foodbank tweets will be making a come back soon.

1833 2018-05-21 20:09:20 Not sure about cannabis oil but other oil stains can come out with dish detergent because it’s made to remove oil.

1841 2018-05-21 20:08:30 The U.S has one goal and one goal only when it comes to Iran.. plunder and steal its resources.  It's not just the oil.. it's the mineral wealth too.  The mineral wealth of Iran gives capitalists the world over wet dreams.
1842 2018-05-21 20:08:21 I wonder if this was new buying, or just shorts covering. I just hope this lunacy doesn't overshoot it. The dollar keeps going up. WTF are the idiots thinking buying!
1843 2018-05-21 20:08:18 Oil won’t go above $44 in my lifetime
1844 2018-05-21 20:08:05 If we use the best ideas in progress now like solid state microwave Pyrolysis plants to process biomass into green gas oil and char we could sequester millions of tons of Co2 every year,heck if we just used the logging debris in Alberta from fires and beetle kill it would work...
1845 2018-05-21 20:08:00 Lol, Engineers? Except the oil people  Others can climb pole and change tyres. Please dont beat me.
1846 2018-05-21 20:07:58 It’s the body shop tea tree oil stuff. I use the cleanser, toner, and mask but I use a idifferent moisturizer bc it’s a little too drying to use the tea tree one
1847 2018-05-21 20:07:57 I shall need to invest  i tried the baby oil trick was ok bt still clung to my ankles  xx
1848 2018-05-21 20:07:53 I did a super basic population model for a class in grad school and found that snakes didn’t do much to reduce rat populations at densities found in nature (I was modeling for oil palm plantations). It would be interesting to have someone really look into it even with modeling.
1849 2018-05-21 20:07:48 Olive oil from Granada, Parmesan from Bologna, truffle oil focaccia from my friend Dave’s kitchen in Wootton Bassett. Cooking is overrated.
1850 2018-05-21 20:07:41 when will Westminster move the nuclear shite from Scotland 
and let us be able to increase the minimal wage 
get all money earned from oil etc
1851 2018-05-21 20:07:39 I agree,if England had the oil riches of the scots they would never accept any "deal" that left them with 8% of their own oil revenues
1852 2018-05-21 20:07:29 I'll maybe look at different types, think mine's calcate? the oil didn't seem to work for me a few years ago, and arms get sore rubbing the stuff in

1864 2018-05-21 20:05:55 i used face wash, face scrub, a facemask and now my face is coated in coconut oil- overkill?
1865 2018-05-21 20:05:49 I hate sitting and waiting for oil changes

1869 2018-05-21 20:05:19 Compare all these years crude oil price with petrol price. Half information is misleading

1875 2018-05-21 20:04:31 Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, Minnesota and Nebraska are pumping them out. It’s skyrocketed with the increased use and demand for biodiesel. Also because of oil seed demand
1876 2018-05-21 20:04:30 vape oil. Please I must see
1877 2018-05-21 20:04:05 weak pound and rising commodity prices especially precious metals and oil. Good for traders but not good for the economy
1878 2018-05-21 20:03:56 Used coconut oil for the first time, I thought it would be way less liquid, damn
I poured too much of it ;;
1879 2018-05-21 20:03:50 Major oil companies are doubling down on gas stations... A geographically wide network of branded retail outlets also could create new opportunities where the industry now sees threats - such as electric charging stations.

1880 2018-05-21 20:03:43 Jesus a few years ago they put oil on the floor and a pregnant teacher fell and was taken to the hospital...so no it’s not just a prank. Doing stupid and illegal stuff is lame and if we can’t come up with pranks that are actually funny then we lame too. period.
1881 2018-05-21 20:03:41 I've been noticing that he may like to drink a oil but too much lmao, he's so good at it!!
1882 2018-05-21 20:03:38 Nope, Chavez diversified the economy a lot, trying to move Venezuela away from an only oil economy, but it was mostly destroyed by the 2008 crash, Venezuela was a oil nation far before Chavez, and stop reading the Torygraph

1888 2018-05-21 20:02:57 great for all the EM countries that buy oil in USD's right?  this has to be destroying someone
1889 2018-05-21 20:02:50 We haven’t bought oil from Iran since the early ‘90s. The rising prices are simply an excuse being used by traders, US producers, and retailers to jack up profit margins.
1890 2018-05-21 20:02:38 .@ghoshworld pretty obvious these ignorant incompetent idiots @SecPompeo and #chickenhawk @realDonaldTrump pulled out of the Iran Deal to spite President Obama and to help Putin’s oil prices by creating Middle Eastern instability. They are a clear danger to world stability. (1)
1891 2018-05-21 20:02:27 Jamie Oliver must have baths in olive oil cunts daft about it. Calm down to a frenzy with the stuff you gimp

1893 2018-05-21 20:02:25 Based change mantra, no transparency, $25bn NNPC scam, oil subsidy,grass cutting, budget padding etc. Hyped foreign reserve no mention of internal and external debts. No audited account . If what happens in the NE, NW, NC happens in your town you will be asking this question.
1894 2018-05-21 20:02:21 I wish gmc would spend more time making there vehicles more reliable! The use way to much oil!

1896 2018-05-21 20:02:18 Very true and very high charger temps which cause high oil consumption and motors don't like being starved of oil... well true you could just change down and automatics are everywhere these days
1897 2018-05-21 20:02:16 One good thing remains.After buhari, we will compare notes. But this govt should start something with the much they have made from sales of oil.
1898 2018-05-21 20:02:13 Tea Tree Oil! It helps. Couple of drops in the bath tub and your good to go.

1903 2018-05-21 20:01:22 Because UPA has created an unpaid loan of 40,000 crores with Iran and after sanctions were removed against Iran, India was obligated to make those payments for crude oil taken at time of UPA

1919 2018-05-21 19:59:50 Some still have delusion they would have any sort of choice if they get the universal health care they demand
1920 2018-05-21 19:59:50 Vita Coco’s a good one! Extra virgin oil, not expensive either, you can get it in boots 
1921 2018-05-21 19:59:46 The price for Gas here in the Philippines goes up to $4.55 a gallon today, depending on what the exchange rate is. Yesterday it was 52.15 Pesos to the $1. The News stated it is due to the world oil market, but everyone knows they are trying to lesson the traffic problems.
1922 2018-05-21 19:59:34 Pass a law.
1923 2018-05-21 19:59:24 I could swear you used to be an oil painting...anyway, congratulations on the face, it was worth the expense.
1924 2018-05-21 19:59:19 Exactly. Still widespread prescription here despite all the subsequent research. Also recent study resulted in advising of use in young people where they increase suicide. Also a  known side-effect in adults esp during withdrawal from some SSRIs. Snake oil.
1925 2018-05-21 19:59:12 iono how parents be letting their children act up and throw fits everywhere my mom would shove olive oil down my throat the moment I tried to throw fits

1927 2018-05-21 19:58:49 WOW that’s good to hear. I thought it was due to the drop in the price of oil, corruption and crazy leadership.
1928 2018-05-21 19:58:48 I know, I know, oil and yields and EMFX and Italy and Trump and Arrested Development is coming back to Netflix and DC rooftop pools are opening this weekend and I need a new bike lock and...where was I going with this? oh yeah, the market is fine.

Introduce me to an expert please
1932 2018-05-21 19:58:14 They need stability in Saudi Arabia because of the oil.   That policy is common knowledge.  No lies required here.
1933 2018-05-21 19:58:07 Don't divide us on religious give a answer about oil price and our basics need
1934 2018-05-21 19:58:04 Now I'm convinced I need one nuclear deal from the  Russian or oil from Arabs we can't be clapping our hands when grown men are bidding on a piece of aluminum written number 5 
1935 2018-05-21 19:57:50 It's a sign that they have very few oil engineers left who know how to get their heavy sludgy oil out of the ground ever since illegally stealing from assets from oil majors who were forced to leave
1936 2018-05-21 19:57:47 Exactly. 

Anti mining yet wait in line for lithium powered devices.

Anti oil yet an abundance of plastic can be found around their dwellings

Anti coal and don't even know that 1/3 of our power plants in this nation still use it. That would make for some cold winters for most.
1937 2018-05-21 19:57:46 a lot of beard products be jus oil to make my shit shine like no I need it to be moist throughout the day
1938 2018-05-21 19:57:45 Into August 17 $38 calls on $CRC. Chased it up a bit, but this stock is heavily levered on higher oil. In at $5.70
1939 2018-05-21 19:57:45 Omg this bitch takes 30 mins to set up an oil change appointment 
1940 2018-05-21 19:57:35 Well, that IS the effect of castor oil.
1941 2018-05-21 19:57:21 @SenToddYoung @VP Tag Along Todd & the Veep, all that tax relief $s going right back to oil companies. Up again today, $3.15 unleaded. IN has been in front of all states in gas increases in last year. Well done, for all elitist & the 1%.
1942 2018-05-21 19:57:19 I would like to think that democracy and the rule of law will always prevail. If it doesn’t, what do we have left? We leave ourselves wide open to whatever lunatic snake oil salesman that comes along. Kinda like what already happened. We’re hanging on by a thread here...
1943 2018-05-21 19:57:18 I’m sure you’ve had advice from everybody, but tea tree shampoo worked for our daughter (a long time ago). Helps to add a few extra drops of neat oil too. The little buggers hate it :)
1944 2018-05-21 19:57:17 It's not the subsidy but the high excise duty that is making petrol and diesel so expensive despite plunge in oil market
1945 2018-05-21 19:57:13 Risk sentiment perked up after US-China trade tensions appeared to relax over the weekend. The S&P500 is up 0.7%, oil and copper are up over 1%, and the AUD outperformed.

1949 2018-05-21 19:56:54 Pompeo is talking crushing sanctions against Iran. Oil companies were already pulling out when Trump broke the deal. They need us if they want to prosper
1950 2018-05-21 19:56:52 100% correct. Even now it is economically unviable to continue extracting oil up there for million & 1 reasons. Scotland also spends £2000 more per head than rest of UK subsided by UK taxpayers which would end post separation leading to halving budgets for edu, health & benefits.
1951 2018-05-21 19:56:49 Slip in a little butter to the oil and it won't burn as fast.
1952 2018-05-21 19:56:46 A trade truce with China and an election in Venezuela is an indication that we will continue a path of strong demand and tighter supply in the global oil market. If the U.S. continues to trade and negotiate with China, both economies will benefit in increasing demand expectations
1953 2018-05-21 19:56:36 It's obvious what the US is doing now, they're pushing Iran further and further into a corner which would result in a war that would end with Israel and the US controlling the Middle East together with the oil sheiks. OBVIOUS Mr. Pompeo OBVIOUS

1955 2018-05-21 19:56:35 Wonder why they are so concerned?? Could it be that Venezuela has the largest untapped oil reserves on earth? Or am I being cynical?

Not 100% sure but this is already happening going East and South out of Alberta and to some sort West. Grain farmers complaining to Feds that CP and CN don,t have the capacity to ship grains because Oil pays better.

1965 2018-05-21 19:55:26 Oil prices are going back up never say never
1966 2018-05-21 19:55:26 @MaddowBlog Do you think that Trump has had the pullout it the Iran deal and made Saudi Arabia slow production of oil to help out Russia out raising the price if oil ?
1967 2018-05-21 19:55:22 Oi amla hair oil bangs, no one @ me on this one 
1968 2018-05-21 19:55:18 I reallllllly wanted to use my oil diffuser so I had to kick Cricket out of my bedroom. She's so upset rn, but it's been a while since I've gotten to smell yuzu+eucalyptus and it's divine 
1969 2018-05-21 19:55:06 $EVEPQ seems to be great r/r at .13. You get 5% of the new company + warrants. Much of the companies long term liabilities were wiped out during the bankruptcy. At .13/shr the new company is valued at ~130MM. Oil at multi year highs helps as well.
1970 2018-05-21 19:55:05 Explain "sick agenda".

1975 2018-05-21 19:54:51 Yup. An oil PR shouldnt have to ask why you have to be careful about condensate on a gas pipeline or the difference between sweet and sour, heavy and light. BBC on Venezuela a good example. Massive oil reserves but its mud not oil. #CommsChat
1976 2018-05-21 19:54:47 Long way to go mate, few years time like this & I might be hitting my goal, it’s a never ending project tho
1977 2018-05-21 19:54:37 Woww I been looking for my oil & its been on the side of the door the whole time
1978 2018-05-21 19:54:33 Dear Mr Wael, am a regular reader of your thoughts and respect your point of view. Short term profit taking is again going to damage the oil industry and everyone will lose at the end. Hope you agree. Regards
1979 2018-05-21 19:54:29 CBD oil gave me my life back, and got me back to work, but be careful, I failed a drug test because of the THC in it even though I was told it was safe for commercial drivers. Now no job until I get substance abuse therapy!
1980 2018-05-21 19:54:21 Here refilling a oil cleaner spray costs way more than just purchasing the whole spray bottle again.
(Which is bizarre since the spray bottle is very high quality)
1981 2018-05-21 19:54:19 I'm not really a trader of oil, but I did get drawn into shorting via an ETF , $DWT, also some puts on $USO. Staying small and looking for a spike up to perhaps add, obviously geopolitical environment could cause an uncle and throw away if that really changes
1982 2018-05-21 19:54:05 Pour four scoops of olive oil then whisk briskly.
1983 2018-05-21 19:54:03 you should try cbd oil!! you got this girl
1984 2018-05-21 19:54:00 Eh? I’m not saying the U.K. is that rich. You’re saying that the oil industry is basically Scottish when it clearly isn’t because the companies that drill there are not Scottish the profits go to those companies who are either American or other nations

1991 2018-05-21 19:52:55 That its goals are aligned with Putin's & Trump's pocketbooks & not the common good rebuts Mr. Ghosh's suggestion to @kasie (filling in for @AliVelshi) that the current administration did its own goals wrong by withdrawing from Iran deal. Think disarray, oil price increases, etc.
1992 2018-05-21 19:52:53 Yes
1993 2018-05-21 19:52:49 Trump?  completely.  What can do when people who think something is 3 tier chess but they've never played chess at all. 

He serves world power.  Serves big oil, willing to pollute and damage... poison citizens. Feed them all less oxygen and see how their brains work.

1995 2018-05-21 19:52:36 Your Islamic regime robbed Iranian people in the last 40 years and used the oil revenue for terrorist activities against the wish of Iranian people and bankrupt Iran and made the whole world enemies of Iran. Your regime will be prosecuted in  court of Iranian nation  soon

1999 2018-05-21 19:51:53 Yeah I was only using olive oil the last couple of days when I went back to my old stainless steel pans.  Are usually make unless that literally slide off the pan. This time I am light turned into scrambled eggs LOL. But F Teflon.
2000 2018-05-21 19:51:45 Well there is still a lot of transportation where oil is basically unbeatable.

2008 2018-05-21 19:50:47 Don’t use olive oil. Use a decent rapeseed or vegetable oil. When tasting the mayo think about acidity (lemon) and seasoning to make sure you get it right. Or sod mayo and aim for aioli as the garlic is more forgiving!
2009 2018-05-21 19:50:46 If BJP were to pass the oil price benefits to common man, how would they be buying MLAs for crores? Doesn't fit, right? 
2010 2018-05-21 19:50:22 This has nothing to do with the oil companies this has to do with the market makers (Traders) who trade oil on the global market exchanges.

2021 2018-05-21 19:48:40 @realDonaldTrump  Thank you for the tax break giving my family extra cash each month. However, the rising cost of gasoline has almost eliminated that tax break. Time to open up our oil reserves and ramp up our own oil wells. #MAGA #POTUS #POTUS45 #Trump2020 #TrumpTrain
2022 2018-05-21 19:48:39 I went to the store to buy oil for my car & walked out with $50 worth of stuff.... and forgot the oil
2023 2018-05-21 19:48:38 Well, it happened. Gas is up over $4 in Seattle. Huge effective tax increase based on Republican policy to allow oil exports.
2024 2018-05-21 19:47:52 they do baby oil every year  now you know that no one has ever been hurt, atp it’s just tradition. and stop crying over the spray paint girl. it went away didn’t it? whoever did it obviously knew what would happen. y’all are acting like all this is brand new.
2025 2018-05-21 19:47:46 Mr. Zarif,  Be honest with Iranian people and yourself for a change in 40 years, Did Ali Khamenehie and the Islamic regime obtain Iranian people permission  to spend billion of dollars of the Oil revenue for failed nuclear project which has bankrupt Iran? Your Regime MUST go.

2032 2018-05-21 19:47:02 I used a zinc cream, apple cider vinegar toner, and vitamin e oil to moisturize.

One of the only things I still felt good about is fading away.. when was the last time you actually noticed how much a gallon of gas costs...? MAGA... NOT
2044 2018-05-21 19:46:18 Assad wouldn't allow an oil pipe through its territory it moved away from the petro dollar next thing jihadis have taken over the country.Michael Flynn American general told al Jazeera that they were funding jihadis. How many governments has America over thrown

2046 2018-05-21 19:45:54 Well, it does indeed closely parallel the onset of plant oil consumption in the 1970s.
2047 2018-05-21 19:45:47 Bro, it takes like 8 mins put a little bit of olive oil in it while it’s boiling and mix so it doesn’t stick to the pot

2053 2018-05-21 19:45:05 Asalamu alaikum brother,  Do you like cryptocurrency?  It would be good for Libya to take a look at it.  I can vision many projects that could be on the blockchain.  Aramco is now developing their own oil token. Let me know if you need some free advice. @shalabolic
2054 2018-05-21 19:45:04 @RonWyden pointed out that Americans are paying more at the pump, despite a massive reduction in taxes for oil companies.  The point is:  when are we going to make it impossible for corporations to buy our candidates?  Dirty money is buying America . . . starting with @POTUS.
2055 2018-05-21 19:45:04 Well, I figured we were on cutesy name calling status...
2056 2018-05-21 19:45:04 Trump’s war cry would be about oil, explicitly, saying “I said take the oil, but we didn’t so now we will!”
2057 2018-05-21 19:44:58 Conservatives were right about expanding Oil and Natural gas drilling now we are dominating. @Potus has made America a nation of winners again. When America wins the world wins.
2058 2018-05-21 19:44:32 Agreed. The timing of the Oil and Gas announcement was cynical in the extreme, and the lack of consultation was appalling. The PM should have gone to Taranaki immediately, not six bloody weeks later. Labour doesn’t care about Taranaki.
2059 2018-05-21 19:44:28 One interesting thing to watch with the new term of Maduro is how he will handle the critical oil situation and he once and for all decides to remove current president of pdvsa... #oott #venezuela

2062 2018-05-21 19:43:51 I was watching ITV this morning a few months ago when Jo Smith was on the sofa. She is living proof that Cannabis oil works!  I'm wondering if it would work for a friend who has Motor Neurone Disease.

2064 2018-05-21 19:43:39 Just rubbed down all my bamboo kitchen stuff with olive oil. Then rubbed the extra into my hands. Then rubbed what didn't soak into my hands on the leather arms of my chair. I love olive oil. Also #SaveTheExorcist

2070 2018-05-21 19:42:00 Yes, but my pans are v. nicely seasoned by now & I never use soap on them. I wipe them with a napkin right away, usually that does it, but sometimes I soak in room temp water for literally a couple of mins to get any hard bits off (& use fingernail) then oil it up b4 putting away
2071 2018-05-21 19:41:54 Unai Emery to Arsenal then - certainly a bit more exciting than Mikel Arteta. Unsure what he will manage with them after coming from unlimited oil money.

2074 2018-05-21 19:41:41 Trump or any other politician has ZERO control over the price of oil...zero...
2075 2018-05-21 19:41:40 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.

2077 2018-05-21 19:41:32 I told Mahmoud Ahmadinejad that Iran would trade oil for water. So you better go back to stealing ice from Antarctica because the drought will continue. Decide to give water to the people or pursue your program.
2078 2018-05-21 19:41:28 دكتور أنور,
سؤالي لك يالغالي هو, هل تستحق منشئات ومرافق أرامكوا 2.5 ترليون دلر بدون الموجود في باطن الارض؟ بعدها نعرف ونفهم ممكن مايقصدون.

تحياتي
2079 2018-05-21 19:41:25 Assuming that American oil companies setting up shop in Iran is one of these "major changes"?
2080 2018-05-21 19:41:24 Same Tax levied on 80% oil imported and 20% oil produced in #India. Good point highlighted by @RKRadhakrishn .

2085 2018-05-21 19:40:20 China was gona buy more anyway. How does that offset anything ? Them buying more doesnt solve the trade deficit dummy. This is your big deal with China.  What about North Korea going to roll over for them to ? Iran deal who benefited from this your local oil buddies. Pathetic sir
2086 2018-05-21 19:40:18 Thought I was just coming for a $40 oil change but my car said fuck me

2096 2018-05-21 19:39:45 Bought some baby oil and now wondering why we need slippery babies
2097 2018-05-21 19:39:44 Did you just say bitumen sinks in water? Weird. Because every heavy oil treater uses the fact that oil floats on water to separate.
2098 2018-05-21 19:39:43 Trump sanctions in Iran is not designed to hurt Iran. But to drive up the prices of gas here in the United States wake up. Trump do not have our best interest at heart. He's only trying to feel the pockets of the oil companies at our expense.
2099 2018-05-21 19:39:42 It may help; have you visited a pain clinic recently ? Some can refer CDB (?) oil. No high, just pain relief
2100 2018-05-21 19:39:28 Depends on where you go. In Poland, France, Spain, Ireland, Portugal, Japan, Switzerland and Italy, Trump is very popular. So not really sure if this guy travels more than I do, but I havent seen any devastation beyond the socialist elite here in our own press and DC of course

2103 2018-05-21 19:39:21 About to get a oil change
2104 2018-05-21 19:39:21 I wasn’t. I’m just saying olive oil isn’t the best.
2105 2018-05-21 19:39:10 I don't think it's realistic to completely stop using coal and oil, but I think we should definitely look into alternative & renewable energies. TBH I think that building a wall of solar panels might not be the worst idea, though the wall itself is a terrible idea and won't work.
2106 2018-05-21 19:39:08 In before people accuse @QTRResearch of being paid off by the oil companies since he’s now fawning over Musk and Tesla.
2107 2018-05-21 19:39:06 What do you smoke on Speculawyer?! The nuclear was not able to prohibit Iran regime to build bomb.  Higher oil price is OK and SAD for you and others that going to buy it.  Here is the point the free Iran is not going to sell you the oil easy.  You will spend lots of money ...
2108 2018-05-21 19:39:05 Natural gas and crude oil combination, companies bullish
2109 2018-05-21 19:38:52 "There was nothing the @MBuhari government did to get @Nigeria out of recession; oil prices peaked and we exited" - Dr Okengwu on the @NTAGMN Show of @NTANewsNow
2110 2018-05-21 19:38:52 "Not many people know this, but the middle east has a lot of oil."
2111 2018-05-21 19:38:39 I feel like I'm on my own Food Network show when I drizzle olive oil with my finger on the top
2112 2018-05-21 19:38:32 Why does this remind me of oil filled supertankers off shore waiting for the perfect oil price to unload?
2113 2018-05-21 19:38:09 This #Map shows how the #US has positioned its allied partner on the  ground "the #ISIS buffer boys" in front of the 2 #Kashmah oil fields to protect the US interests (#OIL) in #Syria. The oil is the reason the US  is waging the war in Syria killing 1000s!
2114 2018-05-21 19:38:03 Again you're asking stupid questions. Why do you think Scotland won't be able to afford defence? Scotland is a modern, English speaking, well educated, peaceful nation, in a strategic position that the US is concerned about. We're an oil rich nation, with whisky and tourism/
2115 2018-05-21 19:38:00 Sure to get money / donations from Offshore Accounts or supporters looking for an Ermine Coat. Meanwhile Scotland keep and sell OUR goods- oil, gas, shellfish , salmon , whisky , gin....
2116 2018-05-21 19:37:48 Well... I changed the oil in the lawn mower, poured in gas, tried to start it up... only to have some gentleman pull over ask me if I was going to mow my lawn? ... and watch me fail. Engine never turned over... for shame!
2117 2018-05-21 19:37:44 I’m at the shop getting an oil change and the man at the counter is like deliberately ignoring the phone.
2118 2018-05-21 19:37:42 This is just embarrassing. No industry!? Really? The revenue from the Scotch whisky industry is 25% of the UK's entire food and drink revenue. Norway's oil has generated a £1 trillion wealth fund. Scotland still has lots of it. Scotland also has renewable energy, salmon etc etc.
2119 2018-05-21 19:37:36 Generally: Islam and all world are just like water and oil :)
2120 2018-05-21 19:37:31 They will never be able to repair the land. Nothing grows in oil. Which is why they ran the pipeline where they did. Put it on Native property in case there is a spill. 
2121 2018-05-21 19:37:31 so i've been reading a TON of skincare threads, CASTOR OIL is 
2122 2018-05-21 19:37:22 Celah mana nak dapat skrg, aku ada cooking oil je skrg hahahah
2123 2018-05-21 19:37:20 They haven't declared war yet but, its going to happen! It has nothing to do w/ nuclear weapons & everything to do w/ all the oil in the middle-east! With Iran out of the way, Turkey who met w/trump in 1st wk,Syria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, etc... U C yet?
2124 2018-05-21 19:37:19 WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS??!!  I WANT TO SEE YOU NAKED!!!!  
2125 2018-05-21 19:37:14 Toxic people are like a body of water contaminated with oil spilled from a broken pipe.

The oil rises to the top but it also suffocates all life inside the water.

You can't swim in this kind of environment.

It'd take a lot of work to clear this oil spill....
2126 2018-05-21 19:37:09 Currie had to give me a play by play on how to check my oil so he’s putting me through an automotive class taught by him. Lookout, about to be a master mechanic 
2127 2018-05-21 19:37:04 I brought my car to the shop for an oil change and asked them to put air in my tires and they find two tires with screws in them are you fucking kidding me

2130 2018-05-21 19:36:28 a eso voy, son las reglas del juego, uno sabe donde se mete. Manipulan el precio del oil, no lo van a hacer con esta que sale 1 chicle? Eso no debería ser excusa para quejarse si le pifiamos
2131 2018-05-21 19:36:24 I can’t believe people actually believe in these signs shit. You’re the same people who buy snake oil for positive energy fuck off
2132 2018-05-21 19:36:14 How can you detourmine if oil / oil containing products are rancid bad? What external applications can be used for those lubricants?
2133 2018-05-21 19:36:09 $CL_F Oil is getting some nice upside again today, we’ve been the Oil Bulls!! Channel high, where it’s prob time to start bailing on at least half IMHO, is discussed in the Weekend Video.
2134 2018-05-21 19:36:02 @POTUS This new EXECUTIVE ORDER to Venezuelan, also means that our country can't sell crude/oil to USA or any allied country? I'm waiting to see what will happen and here we are hopefully we get off this regime.
2135 2018-05-21 19:35:59 MARY was a virgin and she married a carpenter (JOSEPH). YOU are not a virgin and you are waiting for a billionaire to marry you......... My sister you need to be washed with 15 tanks  of anointing oil!
2136 2018-05-21 19:35:53 This is miney laundering by #Coalition. Giving money to oil and gas. FFS #Corruption.
2137 2018-05-21 19:35:46 a wee reminder oil prices up and rising so you will not have that as a fear factor.  Scottish Pound exists at the moment and Swiss Banks display exchange rate. You will struggle on that fear fact also. People getting wise to your porkies. Watch this space #indyref2
2138 2018-05-21 19:35:33 The amount of oil my face generates is saddening.

2141 2018-05-21 19:35:22 Calendula (Califlora) Ointment w/Vitamin E - squeeze about an inch into your plam - add drop pf Vitamin E oil - mix together and put on sunburn - heat goes away, heals and you don't peel. Been using it for 40 years...
2142 2018-05-21 19:35:20 Oh. You’d better do your Kegels and make sure to bring a lot of vegetable oil.
2143 2018-05-21 19:35:13 Of all car enthusiast communities, the VW/Audi one is by far the most entertaining. Shout out to all you crazy bastards. May your oil pans forever remain uncracked and your Check Engine Lights remain undiagnosed. #VW #Audi
2144 2018-05-21 19:35:12 الشركات البترولية في العالم ترتفع قيمتها وتنزل علي حسب احتياطها من الموجود المتوقع في باطن الارض واللي يستخرج بتكلفة غير عالية.
يعني لو احتياطها زاد بترتفع ولو زاد سعر البترول برضو بيرتفع سعرها والعكس

ثانيا لو بس بتنباع الشركه لوحدها بدون النفط, كيف يكون سعرها 2.5 ترليون؟؟!!!!!
2145 2018-05-21 19:35:07 I am short "of" oil in USO put terms...
2146 2018-05-21 19:35:01 The oil wasn't in the water
2147 2018-05-21 19:34:57 After 4 years of insomnia using CBD oil lets me sleep well.
2148 2018-05-21 19:34:49 They are gorgeous. Next time we come I definitely 'need' to get my oil girl the soft toy!!
2149 2018-05-21 19:34:49 Face wipes are a lifesaver. Sunscreen if leaving the house. Moisturizer if staying in  Then when you feel better, double cleanse (oil then cleanser) and try a face mask. I like the Neutrogena ones 
2150 2018-05-21 19:34:47 I’m thinking some oil rich country and all the princes that come with it. To start.
2151 2018-05-21 19:34:39 Actively attack our only earth! Be the worst environmental disaster the world has ever known - and well call you animal agriculture  ( meat ! ) and big oil ! No problem   We won’t even charge you for the problems you create . We just increase avg citizens bills to cover it
2152 2018-05-21 19:34:39 My insurance is 40$ a month, my bike has never leaked oil, and maintenance is easy.. that’s why why cruisers/sport bikes
2153 2018-05-21 19:34:38 I just saw a report, that the U.S. unemployment rate is at 3.9%, the lowest that is has been since the Labor Dept. started recording. There’s a caveat though, Inflation and the price of oil has caused the cost of goods and living to increase.
2154 2018-05-21 19:34:27 That poor is a charlatan, a snake oil salesman
2155 2018-05-21 19:34:26 Slippery slope?  This guy is one step away from making his own police force investigate his investigators. We are catapulting down the slope covered in baby oil.
2156 2018-05-21 19:34:24 Nope,  but a lot of Companies will be leery of US action.  For example, Airbus might not sell planes to Iran.  For example, a multinational oil company might not invest in an Iranian gas fields development.  My guess is that Trump is serious and so is Pompeo.
2157 2018-05-21 19:34:21 Went to the dentist, UPS, put in my glasses prescription, got an oil change, went grocery shopping, and tonight I'm makin chicken parm from scratch for my family and my man!!!! I like today!!!
2158 2018-05-21 19:34:16 Finally gettin this oil changed
2159 2018-05-21 19:34:05 How to refresh a mattress? Add a few drops of essential oil to baking soda, mix, sprinkle on, and one hour later, vacuum off.
2160 2018-05-21 19:34:04 So that's what it's all about? Higher oil prices? And here we thought you liberals cared? You do! About oil prices. And I disagree w Ms Zand. I will keep my Netflix. Will be interesting to see the Obamas making a spectacle of themselves

2166 2018-05-21 19:33:30 Yeap, I am sure they are wealthy too thanks to all the money stolen from our oil production. Stop spreading lies, that is what you should do. Facts are the one you see on the street, not the tales told by corrupt institutions like the CNE or propaganda bought on Telesur.
2167 2018-05-21 19:33:28 You enjoy being gaslit. I get it. You buy into debunked rhetoric because you finally have an old bigot that aligns with your bigotry and "beliefs" and have just been waiting for the snake oil salesman to come around and speak to you in your flyover city.
2168 2018-05-21 19:33:25 Thanks Mr. @realDonaldTrump for this action. This gansters are not making any money with oil anymore they are dealing with drug logistics worldwide. Tha is what they are so powerfull now. Laudering and drugs Maduro, Diosdado, Padrino and narcosoles now best about this.
2169 2018-05-21 19:33:22 Mystic. My seminary profs keep pointing out that the job/life expectancy of a prophet is about 3, maybe 5 years . Also I don't seem to be able to do "Roman candle;" just "small oil lamp." Set me in a window somewhere out in the scrub/woods: I'll surprise you!
2170 2018-05-21 19:33:19 Same people, different platforms! Even the Amaechi and Oshomole that fought for sharing of the excess crude oil money are now saints!
2171 2018-05-21 19:33:12 بارك الله فيك 
2172 2018-05-21 19:33:05 I can respect that as a Hispanic but most presidents do some good things, Trump is helping business owners for ex. But we can’t forget obama wanted tpp, signed oil pipe lines, escalated wars, list goes on,just didn’t address many of the real problems
2173 2018-05-21 19:33:01 This. You can’t ignore his time on the big stage. Arsenal may not be the oil fueled mess of PSG, but we’re not a small club either.
2174 2018-05-21 19:32:59 @simonahac when in the UK, go  to Brighton Marina on the Susex coast & do a tour of the Rampion wind farm. It's 13k off shore, 161 units for total 400mw.
Sure the water might be deeper of Sydney but if they can do it in the UK why can't we? Oil rig platforms are in deeperwaters.

2179 2018-05-21 19:32:32 Will have zero impact on the climate? I love how oil shills bandy about claims like this without actually exploring any of the complexity. Just let a Texas company have its billions and its floods, sea level rise, and spills for the rest of you.

2181 2018-05-21 19:32:06 I am not a part of the oil industry. Even so, what would it matter? Consumer Reports speaks for itself.
2182 2018-05-21 19:32:00 Hoping the sleepless nights translates as 'inspiration is causing me to burn the midnight oil'.... Loved the first book, can't wait for the second (but no pressure!) xx
2183 2018-05-21 19:31:59 He represents what’s great in US.If we’d have filled his energy policies we’d be leaders in world for sustainable energy & no wars for oil.Being immature, imbecile with no intellectual curiosity or reading skills while speaking at a 5th grade level doesn’t make great pres either
2184 2018-05-21 19:31:51 @jimcramer Hi Jim. You are my very first tweet...  Would like your opinion on the coincidence on crude oil's rise in price and the Saudi's wanting to raise the IPO price of ARAMCO, which I believe they were not happy with the initial response.  OPEC still influential?
2185 2018-05-21 19:31:49 #WeAreErdogan Erdogan supplies 75% of Israel's crude oil because Arab countries lay an embargo on Israel One day after Erdogan's public meeting to condemn Israel, 1 million barrels of oil shipped to Israel..
Palestine support is just a hypocritical facade to gain vote
2186 2018-05-21 19:31:49 Doc, the looting in this country is unprecedented. The big boys now want to disenfranchise the Turkana people who have been marginalized by respective governments since independence. Oil has been found on their land, they should be getting the biggest share it's only fair.
2187 2018-05-21 19:31:27 Too many things are made out of the by products of burning coal to stop completely, oil, everything you eat and wear has oil products, so there will always be a need for both. Just nothing close to the scale we are wasting all of it right now.
2188 2018-05-21 19:31:25 An American soldiers didn't liberate anyone , not in Iraq,not in #Syria. Fighting for oil and influence in both countries,the US bombed Raqqa for SDF messy gang to use them against t SAA.Otherwise!Why the US and SDF sits on DeirEzzor gas and oil and bomb the SAA if they move in
2189 2018-05-21 19:31:11 And here’s the sad part. With all the instability Trump is unleashing in the Middle East, oil prices are climbing. This will serve as a lifeline to Maduro. Sanctions have failed, opposition is hapless, Inter-American system impotent, & USA has no strategy whatsoever! Sigh!
2190 2018-05-21 19:31:10 I just paid $50 for a oil change like I drive a fucking Wraith 
2191 2018-05-21 19:30:57 Have you ever heard of what your minister of Petroleum calls "Direct Sale, Direct Purchase (DSDP)?

If that his " concoction " is true to its name, then why in God's name are we still paying N 145 per liter ... as far back as when crude oil was around $ 30 per barrel?

2200 2018-05-21 19:29:35 England alone simply hasn't the infrastructure in place to cut off trade with Scotland.
They haven't the facilities to land oil from elsewhere, for example.
2201 2018-05-21 19:29:32 The oil of the Holy Spirit is on Bishop Corletta J. Vaughn. I want that make-up. It lasted from 7 am to 10 pm last night. She looked amazing.

2207 2018-05-21 19:28:57 Your skin could be dry, and it’s overcompensating with oil.. which is why you might feel oily throughout the day. Or you’re a combination of oily/dry. It’s hard to say... like are your pores visible or is your skin a little bumpy w/o visible pores?
2208 2018-05-21 19:28:56 “Praise Like Oil” my favorite on their “Mmuso” album.

2215 2018-05-21 19:28:16 There was a stupid craze years ago when I was at high school for going out in the sun with baby oil on. Let’s say there was a lot of pretty badly sunburnt people going around. I wasn’t stupid enough to try it.
2216 2018-05-21 19:28:15 What's the difference between cbd oil and cbd e liquid
2217 2018-05-21 19:28:12 ......... goodluck, olive oil
2218 2018-05-21 19:27:56 I agree oil, diesel and gas are out dated, there was a program for a 100% renewal gel the could be used in both electric cars, with a drycell, or hydrogen combustion engines, but that was before Obama got in and killed it. But we will still need to burn some.
2219 2018-05-21 19:27:51 Only kings know about tea tree oil.

Sports pays more than oil in UK.
2221 2018-05-21 19:27:45 Even they butchered lakhs of muslims too and most of them are from europe & western converts.

And it is made to control gulf oil wells thats the reason only oil rich countries are in trouble.

2223 2018-05-21 19:27:35 Aye right!the only problem with that will be the absence of oil revenue. If we’re sic a drain then they’d be happy to let us go our own way. There’s evidence that WM has ‘lived off’ the oil but we’ll not agree eh?
2224 2018-05-21 19:27:35 If my car needs more than an oil change. Im giving it back & getting a new one.  I aint got the time for anything else.

2230 2018-05-21 19:27:20 You’re missing the point, which is to blockade only Canadian oil. OPEC oil and US oil good; Canadian oil bad. They do not want to give up petoleum-based products; only ban Canadian oil. Follow the money. Who is paying them?
2231 2018-05-21 19:27:13 Castor oil
2232 2018-05-21 19:27:01 Omg the oil needs a flavor besides “fart” my kid will NEVER... instruction/ suggestions would be a nice touch to encourage repeat business.
2233 2018-05-21 19:26:53 Hah, yes....starting in the summer 2015 = a low baseline of oil prices so far lol.
2234 2018-05-21 19:26:43 Your call. Your knowledge of the oil industry is as demonstrably bad as the Venezuelan authorities’
2235 2018-05-21 19:26:23 r u gonna stop playin siege now cus they made the operators drink 2 much olive oil
2236 2018-05-21 19:26:06 You expect countries that have only ruled themselves for less than 100 years to be on the level of the West. And at least they get rich off their own oil, Britain and France prospered on the backs of others resources.

2246 2018-05-21 19:25:16 As long as oil has a market value which makes it profitable for companies to drill oil/mine bitumen, that won’t happen.  Demand for oil is there... (85 million barrels/day).  That’s where the problem lies.
2247 2018-05-21 19:25:14 Vice and real good? Those two things don't mix. It's like oil and water.

2266 2018-05-21 19:23:35 SaudiArabia is probably investing in renewable energy resources as most of the oil industry is doing. And all the intelligent governments in the world. Pity that our government chose to move us back 100 years!
2267 2018-05-21 19:23:27 Lmao! The USA was in bed w/ Saudi Arabia before the orange bitc* was selected ! Oil , and our insistence on controlling the Middle East ensure our lies will cont.
2268 2018-05-21 19:23:25 Yeah, I know.
2269 2018-05-21 19:23:22 Kamala...where are you on new refineries and more oil wells?
Don't think small ball, think outside the CA box. Why is oil surging with Anwar having been approved for exploration..exploration..give me a break-just drill there and get more oil into the market.
I live 5.2 mi from CA
2270 2018-05-21 19:23:15 raw almonds (no oil, no salt, not in trail mix, etc) are a good snack that can make you feel full. lots of fiber and good fats.

also replace "raw almonds" with "kaz" and its still a true statement
2271 2018-05-21 19:23:04 Jamie Oliver’s trying to ban 2 for 1 pizza’s but I’m watching him “chuck together a sausage comfort dish” with focaccia, beans from a jar (notably not from a tin) and extra virgin olive oil. Not the same class AT ALL is it
2272 2018-05-21 19:23:03 Look, your president is a scam, this is about oil in the middle-east! By pulling the U.S. out of the Iranian deal it became a landrun for Russia, Egypt & Benjamin Natinyahu, but not the Isreali people, they can't stand him; anyway, trump getting fat pockets!
2273 2018-05-21 19:23:02 Praise like oil.....

2278 2018-05-21 19:22:32 @dmarino4 given that shipping between US #ports must be done by #boats built in the US, how influential can the #Oil #stockpiles at our ports be at mitigating volatility in the US oil markets relative to global market volatility?
2279 2018-05-21 19:22:20 Venezuela has nothing to offer the Trump family except refugees and questionable oil exports so don't expect congratulations.
2280 2018-05-21 19:22:17 It definitely says more about them than it does the accused.

2296 2018-05-21 19:20:09 The Canadians are turning the whole province of Alberta into a toxic waste dump in the pursuit of tar oil. There has to be a better way of doing things than what multinational corporations are proposing.

2316 2018-05-21 19:18:02 So, when I say my engine can get 80-95% of the fuel gone it also means you can do it with Natural Gas and not oil.  

Look, the future is in the air.  Low weight is needed for flying.  BATTERIES ARE HEAVY!  Electrics won't work!

Electrics are not needed to get 95% of fuel GONE,

2322 2018-05-21 19:17:29 It would be wonderful to live in a country where renewable energy is seen as a real option, but I feel like our President doesn't like that idea and instead really likes burning massive amounts of coal and oil. I think he would feel jealous if the Earth outlived him.
2323 2018-05-21 19:17:25 Amazing. I also use avocado oil which seems to be OKAY but I guess I might as well just stick with evoo
2324 2018-05-21 19:16:57 Greed - with the excise duty levied on a per-litre basis and not as a percentage of the price it means even when the cost  of oil falls, the tax remains at the same level

2340 2018-05-21 19:15:28 @POTUS Sir how about taking a stand on these ridiculous gas prices? With the oil reserves we have there is no reason to pay over 99 cents per gallon of 92 octane.
2341 2018-05-21 19:15:14 While you were distracted by Trump's tweets, Nazis allowed oil drilling in an annoyed refugee. Sad!

2345 2018-05-21 19:15:05 Petrol pricing issue has been the talk of the town off late. But, why don't you check out the crude oil prices when Congress was in power in comparison to today prices. Moreover, check out the fixation of excise duty on it. What amuses me, how can you justify popping population?

Should provincial governments do more to encourage industry growth at a time when prices are rising? #FD88miccheckyo
2352 2018-05-21 19:14:41 why does anyone think that a certain oil rich gulf state has started to invest in tourism... its never a good idea to rely one a single source of income with a very dynamic market to run a country

@USArmy where's my check?
2372 2018-05-21 19:12:21 Have you got any idea what kind of destruction this would bring to Greece? We would have an inflation in the thousands%. We produce fuck all and all tourist parts tax evade. We would become the Venezuela or Europe minus the oil. You people are frankly economically illiterate
2373 2018-05-21 19:12:20 @FirestoneAuto You all need to send someone to your store at 7985 Centennial, Memphis TN. It is in complete disarray. Dropped my truck off YESTERDAY for an oil change and rear brake job. I was told it'd be ready at 9:15 AM. It's 2:10 PM. Truck is not ready.
2374 2018-05-21 19:12:16 Only you seem to think you can’t be a person after your presidency. Bush was also sitting on multi millions from oil industry he inflated while president. Check out their ages when presidency ended. One ready for retirement, one not close
2375 2018-05-21 19:12:08 Oil cooled coils, what a great idea. Looks like one isn't getting enough though.
2376 2018-05-21 19:12:02 So too with Sec. Perry.  He is making America Texas, ramping up evil oil , yet very little outrage interfering as he quietly has made us energy-independent.

2388 2018-05-21 19:11:11 Fossil fuel is coal for power plants. Crude oil is abiotic and not biological. It's historically been wrong to believe crude oil originated from dead sea plankton, dead plants/trees and dead dinosaurs. But hey, going oil free? Go for it! Just write it as crude oil free!
2389 2018-05-21 19:11:09 Coconut oil is like eating moisturiser because. ... well... it is eating moisturiser. ?
2390 2018-05-21 19:11:07 Agree, any increase in oil is felt instantly at the pumps but a fall takes much longer and then over 60% of the price on fuel is paid in tax - its scandalous !!

2409 2018-05-21 19:09:25 Sanctions will not be so painful. Iran has oil. It will use Barter trade, avoiding Western banks & SWIFT. Will use Chinese or Russian equivalent. There will be  boomerang if other nations start bartering. Never smart to be boastful. Time will tell how successful sanction will be.
2410 2018-05-21 19:09:10 A bit of watercolor, oil pastel, ink etc.
2411 2018-05-21 19:09:05 So we took the inflation bumps to withstand the falling wages and along the way two oil crisis accelerated this problem.
2412 2018-05-21 19:08:59 When global oil was $78 in 2009 indian [etrol was rs44. 
Now rs84. The difference is not subsidy but extreme tax n duty. 

Modi govt is extravagant & wasteful on non-essentials. 
Propaganda is not substitute for performance is the take.
2413 2018-05-21 19:08:45 Just make sure you don’t go to a country that has oil reserves.

2417 2018-05-21 19:08:19 I have a conch piercing, and the healing was definitely the worst part. Watch out for keloids (bumps that form around piercings, can be helped with tea tree oil). I found that not having a hoop in mine made the healing process less painful. Anyway, good luck!
2418 2018-05-21 19:08:16 Gas prices are set by the oil companies and they are rising around the world. It has nothing to do with a carbon tax.
2419 2018-05-21 19:08:14 @narendramodi @PMOIndia Can the extra excise duty of oil imposed in 2014 be taken back now?
2420 2018-05-21 19:08:12 The fact that I’m not using anything on my hair but my hair growth oil & my hair is growing lovely
2421 2018-05-21 19:07:54 That one was by Jesus - the con man who often spoke in parables like all snake oil salesmen do. Moses on the other hand wasn't versed enough to use parable nor did he have reason to since he wasn't claiming to be a real life demigod.

2427 2018-05-21 19:07:31 Trimmed $BP position by 17%. Mostly a long term hold but taking some at 45% profit is worth our time. $WTI is going to turn into a nasty short opportunity at some point. IDK if it's $80 or $100 but the position is on & awaiting large adds. You all need to get oil to overbought

2432 2018-05-21 19:06:56 , a UI would bankrupt Ireland. So no answer to why so many Irish people move to the UK for work. Unemployment rate in Ireland is higher than mainland Britain, and much higher than NI. Cost of living in Ireland is much higher. No NHS, Oil is more expensive, so is Gas,electricity

2436 2018-05-21 19:06:22 Coincidence that Venezuela has oil!...looks like those poor fuckers are about to get a taste of ‘American freedom’...for the people of course..not the oil..it’s never about the oil...

2439 2018-05-21 19:06:12 Yea. Using mostly water, with a little bit of oil does give an odd bubbling effect, but it doesn't really stick. I might try some more experimentation.

2441 2018-05-21 19:05:57 Jungle fever around the ankles. I also use tea tree oil in body lotion that helps to stop them
2442 2018-05-21 19:05:55 I understand the words but it doesn’t add up to anything. Do you mean- open borders immigration for example? How would your economy cope ? Scotland had the oil (Aberdeen-decimated), tourism inc. whiskey but no heavy industry as such (like England it’s gone) maybe some finance?
2443 2018-05-21 19:05:51 What do you use hemp oil for?
2444 2018-05-21 19:05:42 Drenched my hair in coconut oil in hopes of bringing it back from the dead

2445 2018-05-21 19:05:33 RESEARCHERS IN VITAMIN B17 AND CBD OIL DO GOOD....
2446 2018-05-21 19:05:20 Fibertec's Northern Michigan facility, located in Cadilac, offers several analyses tailored for the oil and gas community. Visit http;//fibertec.us/petroleum.html for more information!
2447 2018-05-21 19:05:18 Also, Neem oil works really well according to Opie. Pet safe, water will wash it off, but it's pretty effective.
2448 2018-05-21 19:05:15 Did you smoke flower or just take CBD oil?
2449 2018-05-21 19:05:10 In addition to Superfund site, EPA must stop the toxic air pollution from the oil re-refineries on the Columbia.
2450 2018-05-21 19:05:08 I find that ironic yeah. I mean we do basic maintenance when necessary on these cars. Oil/tires/brakes/other problems as they arise. Otherwise out on the road a lot.
2451 2018-05-21 19:05:08 Some of my favorites are the BeeHive candles which are hand dipped bees wax and essential oils. They also have coconut oil tea lights I’ve been wanting to try!
2452 2018-05-21 19:04:55 Hux is screaming « USE THE FORCE!!! USE THE FORCE TO STIMULATE IT!!! » while Kylo is rubbing oil on his beard and bypassing Stormtroopers are signing up for reconditioning, anything to forget.
2453 2018-05-21 19:04:55 Because Putin needed oil prices to go up, his economy relies on it- that I think explains his support for #drumpf
2454 2018-05-21 19:04:54 you can blame two things, the price of oil has jumped and the tax charged by the government!

2456 2018-05-21 19:04:29 Agreed. I never understood how you cross thread a oil plug!?! It’s lubed for god sakes! Some people plow my mind.
2457 2018-05-21 19:04:18 They’re training to become oil company executives.
2458 2018-05-21 19:04:17 the US needs to steal Venezuela's oil
2459 2018-05-21 19:04:06 @ScottyG1280 can you #AskHans which Hostess fruit pie flavor I should get? I'm at Holiday Oil paralyzed by indecision.

2462 2018-05-21 19:03:34 Cooking nakeds great fun till the oil start poppin
2463 2018-05-21 19:03:34 Says snake oil salesman  and  the only AG EVER held in contempt by Congress.

 It's become obvious that oversight of the DOJ is CRITICAL. 

Time to clean the people's DOJ.
2464 2018-05-21 19:03:31 Does that mean that for the US Venezuela’s government, as guardian of the national subsoil patrimony, can’t sell any more #oil? Just askin’.
2465 2018-05-21 19:03:16 Anyway last night I got coconut oil on my new pink shorts, and I'd just like to know why colorless oil still leaves a stain? And why oil is the devil's reject of stains?
2466 2018-05-21 19:03:13 @realDonaldTrump Dear Mr. Trump: Enough of ineffective measures against Maduro. You do not buy us more oil until the regime falls. Do not give more money from that sale of oil to finance the genocide

2469 2018-05-21 19:02:41 Zero emission vehicle will not move and have ambient temperature. How about A\C exhaust, break pads, oil, battery production. Even if you put instead of engine Zimbabwe guy (as bonus for rejoining to commonwealth), he will emits gas, water, dirt, and noise pollution
2470 2018-05-21 19:02:39 I want Saudi Arabia to win the world cup and set all oil refineries in Russia on  before they leave the country.
2471 2018-05-21 19:02:28 I’m so ready for summer nights. Summer vibes. Being barefoot all day. Walking down the road with nothing but a bindle on a stick. Being a train hopping vagrant. Wearing a hat with the top popped out. Slicing up a single baked bean between me and my friends near an oil barrel fire
2472 2018-05-21 19:02:27 pool party on Sunday? #NoThanksIdRather take a swim in the deep fry oil at the Red Rabbit
2473 2018-05-21 19:02:27 his efforts which are massive sanctions for which major companies in technology, oil even in Europe are pulling back from Iran!  And the people of Iran have no power to seize bank accounts or even follow the money trail   of the IRGC, the mullahs! plus allies of US against Iran

2477 2018-05-21 19:02:16 A torture practice common in medieval Europe was pouring boiling water and/or oil over a person's genitals. We here, in 2018, subject ourselves to this voluntarily. #NeedRefrigeratedWaterTanks
2478 2018-05-21 19:01:48 All the cool kids are doing olive oil shooters now. Hipper than juuling, even.
2479 2018-05-21 19:01:46 Not sure that Consumer Reports should be regarded as a branch of the oil industry. And complex software is often not so easy to fix.

2482 2018-05-21 19:01:11 My dr suggested primrose oil. Only thing is, I never had to use it cause she ended up coming. A week before my due date at my appt, he said if she wasn’t here within the week, the get the oil. But she ended up coming a day before her due date.

2484 2018-05-21 19:00:31 Yeah, venison is good, it just doesn't have the economic incentives of (say) whale oil or beaver pelts. I need to take up hunting just as payback for what deer have done to my cars.

2487 2018-05-21 19:00:24 كم مدة امتياز التنقيب لأرامكو حالياً أخي الكريم ؟؟
2488 2018-05-21 19:00:21 ずいぶん遅くまで起きてるなー　ふにゃ…俺は眠い…(つω´)。゜
2489 2018-05-21 19:00:13 Too poor to go see Deadpool 2 yet this week as all my money will be going to my Rheumatologist when I see him on Friday. So I took a hot bath with rose and ylang ylang oil so I can feel all sexy at work this afternoon.
2490 2018-05-21 19:00:08 As much as I wanted the Jets to advance, I have no hard feelings toward the Knights. It is a surprise to the vast majority of all levels of hockey ppl, myself included.  I am still ticked off of my Oil having such a shitty season once again!  It is what it is!
2491 2018-05-21 19:00:07 Dumbest thing I’ve ever used for a car. When I could do an oil in 10 mins now takes me up to 40 depending on the dum vacuum pump.
2492 2018-05-21 19:00:04 A staple of vending machines! We were allowed to eat Fritos when I was a kid because they're just corn, salt, & oil. But I didn't know about Frito Pie til later.
2493 2018-05-21 19:00:00 Proudly serving Richmond since 2010, we're a full service car wash and oil change center offering professional detailing, oil changes, headlight restoration, and more. We can take care of all of your vehicle's needs!
2494 2018-05-21 18:59:55 We were in a town that has a huge gun factory & also the largest export of rose oil in Bulgaria & I said it was Guns N’ Roses but my group didn’t think it was funny :(
2495 2018-05-21 18:59:32 The first gift I ever bought babe off a whim was a bottle of beard oil. HYDRATE. HYDRAFE
2496 2018-05-21 18:59:31 So on Saturday we spent 20 minutes looking for our cooking oil and it turns out meg threw it away thinking it was an empty bottle 
2497 2018-05-21 18:59:28 The biggest gap in Somalia's constitution is its complete failure to define resource jurisdiction and revenue sharing. Filling that gap can jumpstart exploration and development of oil, gas and minerals. I would love to help by applying internationally accepted lessons to Somalia
2498 2018-05-21 18:59:24 Bout to mix up my own #CBD infused massage oil , throw some Arnica & magnesium oil in there too 
2499 2018-05-21 18:59:13 @PMOIndia Can the extra excise duty of oil imposed in 2014 be taken back now?
2500 2018-05-21 18:59:11 Lol that’s close to there dum reasoning. Guess In 2017 they started making cars other no plugs, so this vacuum sys was applied. Well nuff stupid people couldn’t put a plug back without x threading them so they said hay just use the vac so we don’t have to replace any oil pans.
2501 2018-05-21 18:59:06 If someone eats Booty should they brush their teeth after? Asking for A friend!
2502 2018-05-21 18:59:06 Why are there no Eastern Airline employees doing the same thing? Because management put the firm $$$ in bigger planes and ... oil embargo.
2503 2018-05-21 18:59:06 Por isso que pus no mínimo 30-40% do preço como ineficiência e corrupção . Eu dei ainda uma colher de chá. Fiz uma conta super super otimista pra Petr4 e pra quem acha que isso é “paridade Oil”. Tá refutado com a boa e velha matemática da 4ª série do fundamental.
2504 2018-05-21 18:58:56 Only had two littles with me today so we dropped off items at Goodwill, went to the pediatrician, grocery shopped, got gas and got an oil change. #travelinglight, #perspective
2505 2018-05-21 18:58:54 Yo where is the sun lol that’s why I’m over here sad for no reason why is my coconut oil still solid???
2506 2018-05-21 18:58:43 them having to pour shit over the oil and block off the busy ass hallways to clean it up was them working 100x harder. they usually clean after school or during passing periods when the school isn’t crowded. they stay late asf and come early asf so they can clean uninterrupted.
2507 2018-05-21 18:58:25 Just filled up my gas tank and now I’m getting an oil change and a “works” car wash. My girl is getting hella treated today.
2508 2018-05-21 18:58:16 That new high close in Brent and WTI crude #Oil signaling higher prices.  #MondayMotivation
2509 2018-05-21 18:57:58 I'm implying that you can't possibly be stupid enough to be taken in by Mike's snake oil, so you must be being sarcastic.
2510 2018-05-21 18:57:44 Almost everyone at my job is a hippie. I was walking down the hallway and one therapist was doing yoga and another was burning relaxing oil and my boss is basically doing an astrological reading for this girl’s birthday via email
2511 2018-05-21 18:57:42 All very clever. 

Unfortunately it all falls apart when you realize shippers not Chinese customers underwrite the pipeline.  

TMX is fully subscribed by the likes of CNRL and Imperial Oil because it's economic.
2512 2018-05-21 18:57:38 Oy Vey! 
2513 2018-05-21 18:57:33 Agree w/ Ben. You may be hoping that U.S. output reduces global investment in supply. The displacement is clearly <100%, so maximizing U.S. investment creates net additional supply and lower prices (Hello, rebound effect!) plus more political pressure to resist transition off oil
2514 2018-05-21 18:57:30 @KBuccleuchA No burning the midnight oil yr11..get a good night’s rest and reassure yourself you have worked hard. See you at 8am for refreshments and Canham’s final thoughts @shambavi12 @AidanLowrie @laurennandrew
2515 2018-05-21 18:57:22 Changed my oil on my motorcycle for the 2nd time yesterday. Except I didn't see that the o-ring for the oil filter cap had slipped so as I tightened the cap it cut the o-ring...so oil just spills out when the bike is on. Waiting on replacement. Had to rent a car for the week.
2516 2018-05-21 18:57:14 I’ve been thinking about just eating an avocado everyday and adding olive oil to my food
2517 2018-05-21 18:57:13 Friendly reminder: School's out for Summer.
2518 2018-05-21 18:57:12 I can’t wait to go home and rejuvenate!!! I need to pick up some tea tree oil too!
2519 2018-05-21 18:57:12 It seems you're the only one confused by something that almost always happens... Have you ever been to a game in Houston? The humidity sticks to you like you was wearing baby oil.
2520 2018-05-21 18:57:10 I don't recommend using oil. I tried that last night and it doesn't mix or swirl at all. 
2521 2018-05-21 18:56:49 The brakes I got done before the mountains, but I had to get an oil change and my tire pressure done after that incident 
2522 2018-05-21 18:56:47 تحت الأرض لحملة الأسهم بكاملها لأن الامتياز الخالي غير محدد بزمن معين (أكرر الامتياز الحالي ليس محدد بمدة معينة لذا فان البترول سيصبح ملك حملة الأسهم طوال عمر البترول)
2523 2018-05-21 18:56:46 Iran has lot more to offer than just oil and we should take advantage of it before it’s too late
2524 2018-05-21 18:56:36 Drink a tot of extra virgin olive oil a day.
2525 2018-05-21 18:56:28 The results are real! lol I actually use this oil and my hair is flourishing
2526 2018-05-21 18:56:24 Wait, he’s actually getting a Netflix show? God, what have we come to?
2527 2018-05-21 18:56:12 Just a symptom of palm oil poisoning I am afraid. It is the famous palm oil toxic tumble.
2528 2018-05-21 18:55:57 Hahaha...oil money gang buda.
2529 2018-05-21 18:55:57 Got an oil change today after driving my car around 3,000 miles. How's THAT for being a responsible grown up person.
2530 2018-05-21 18:55:48 BJP IT Cell will burn midnight oil to divert attention.
2531 2018-05-21 18:55:47 Cantu shampoo spilled on my floor and tea tree oil spilled on my dresser...  this smell mixture

Chronic pain sucks oxycodone saved my life I won’t do heroin instead
2536 2018-05-21 18:55:39 There called transmission lines and condemning the poor to only uses intermittent electricity smacks of green colonialism.
2537 2018-05-21 18:55:25 the economy is in the toilet were all fuckin pwned . peak oil is done, the furries will rule one day . all police men hand in your badges and guns
2538 2018-05-21 18:55:20 i spilled oil on my pants at work & washed them twice and it’s permanently stained so i bet everyone there thinks im rollin up dirty as fuck lmao
2539 2018-05-21 18:55:17 @alai_pettigrew is a serious pro. His team are real leaders in the independent oil/marine nexus - which is something of unique sector.
2540 2018-05-21 18:55:09 If it goes shit you can remove it with oil almost instantly 
2541 2018-05-21 18:55:09 If you want a friend, I’m down to join ya
2542 2018-05-21 18:55:06 True. The demand for plastic is out of control. Plastic is wreaking havoc on the planet from oil & gas fields & pollution from it is very harmful to wildlife. Digging up petroleum is not good for the environment either. What is a solution for *already existing* oil & gas fields?
2543 2018-05-21 18:55:04 CBD Oil is amazing for anxiety!
2544 2018-05-21 18:54:59 تحياتي واحد منهم كان يقول ماراح يتجاوز الخمسين دولار ماقصر الله يجزاه خير
2545 2018-05-21 18:54:55 Actually this 5% the devil is in the details cos on paper it reads the 5% is shared to the community. So it will be shared with Lamu, Tana River communities where the oil pipeline passes.
2546 2018-05-21 18:54:50 Baby oil works so well x
2547 2018-05-21 18:54:46 Pro tip: if you're ever burnt by hot oil, IMMEDIATELY apply the OG white Colgate to the area. Leave it on overnight. Wash off after at least 12 hours, there won't even be a mark on your skin. It'll be like nothing happened. RT to save a life.
2548 2018-05-21 18:54:39 Give us the rights to the oil and we’ll come help them. Lol

I hate quote 'it's not personal' especially if it touches me...I wonder what would @UN rep say to mothers of those killed children - sorry...BUT really it's not personal..just need oil
2552 2018-05-21 18:54:25 Went in for an oil change yesterday and ended up with my exhaust ripped off my car. It now sounds like a fucking war plane you can hear this thing from a half a mile away. How does this shit happen here
2553 2018-05-21 18:54:25 twitter hates me and wont post th tweet abt me being an idiot and losing the oil packet in my cup ramen the second i opened it
2554 2018-05-21 18:54:20 The US administration is an arm/oil dealing cartel with an army of mercenaries. They kill innocent people in the name of bringing democracy for them.
2555 2018-05-21 18:54:16 Get the Booger No Domestic Products party out! They want to stop oil & gas, but don't want to discontinue their usage, the don't want more electrical power, but won't quit their usage. Hypocrites much?!
2556 2018-05-21 18:54:14 باختصار لو تم طرح أرامكو في السوق العالمية بوضعها الحالي من غير اصدار مرسوم من الحكومة ينص ان مدة الامتياز محددة بزمن معين فأن البترول تحت الأرضلا جميعه سيصبح مملوك لحامل السهم بمقدار قيمة سهمه (اكرر بمقدار قيمة سهمة فقط) لكن لو تم طرح أرامكو بالكامل فيصبح جميع البترول الذي هو

Because we are good fur-parents! 
2558 2018-05-21 18:53:52 OK, new idea: Tell people that the true answer to the "Yanny and Laural" question is hidden in Palestine so the public finally gives a shit about the region.

Update: Oh dear it appears they found oil. RIP
2559 2018-05-21 18:53:49 My cup runneth over. I worry not! Goodnight..

2562 2018-05-21 18:53:33 You fools,petrol prices are controlled by world crude oil prices,not by Indian government,go argue with middle easterners,they will just cut you to pieces.....
2563 2018-05-21 18:53:33 What, are they afraid you'll spill? They don't think you know how to use an oil pan ffs?? Good grief. lol Got to love how technology simplifies our lives, right? 
2564 2018-05-21 18:53:23 It is very simple...tons of instructions out there how to roast or bake it....I prefer to use coconut oil and pink sea salt.
2565 2018-05-21 18:53:09 Shortbus can't reply without dropping an "f" bomb but gifs offend him.  LMAO...go find your safe space Key and don't forget your crayons.
2566 2018-05-21 18:53:03 When a ship sinks all the bilge and oil come to the surface first; defines people like Eric Holder, Clapper and Brenner.  But who with any common sense doesn't realize that none of these people did what THEY did without the approval of President Obama; he is the ringleader!
2567 2018-05-21 18:53:02 You going to drill for some oil Jay?

NDP is history at the next Alberta election. Polling around 26%.

2573 2018-05-21 18:52:28 * President Donald Trump stepped up economic pressure on Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro with an order prohibiting purchases of debts owed to the government, including to the state-run oil companyPetroleos de Venezuela.
2574 2018-05-21 18:52:15 Oil prices are to increase which also affects the petrol prices.Batswana just got hit by a price hike in petrol,not so far from now another price hike will happen. Tough times ahead
2575 2018-05-21 18:52:10 yeah and then put oil on top so it wont be so hard then put a bandanna or something on!!
2576 2018-05-21 18:52:09 It never ceases to amaze me when citizens claim there is a spending problem and not a revenue problem. Let’s go back 300 years & eliminate all taxes. Or maybe we should figure out where all that oil wealth (royalties)really went over the last 60 years or so.

2579 2018-05-21 18:52:03 So you're saying the inventor of the gifs portion of Twitter is a redneck? Interesting...
2580 2018-05-21 18:52:00 As you can see, My engine can get us OFF OF OIL for cars and trucks just by changing out the engines and adding in fuel tanks.  Old trucks can have new engine and use old frame.   Run all transit from Nat Gas, not oil.  Use oil as back up fuel for range issue.  No anxiety.

2582 2018-05-21 18:51:52 Every time I come to the 19.99 $ oil change place I pay 49.99  because obviously only 1999 cars get the 19$ deal wtf. 
2583 2018-05-21 18:51:50 I do. :) You need to use oil and butter combo. That works best. Like a tablespoon of each.
2584 2018-05-21 18:51:45 You don't need oil. Nobody needs oil. You just need pap and beef 
2585 2018-05-21 18:51:45 Nino is clearly a buffoon who doesn’t understand how govt works.   I suppose the president has no effect on immigration too?  Backing out of the Iran deal alone may have significant impact on oil prices, and he did that all on his own.
2586 2018-05-21 18:51:23 Unai about to take his Oil contacts with him 
2587 2018-05-21 18:51:20 Which is real?

2589 2018-05-21 18:51:06 Hi Martin, my support team have got back to me and I am happy to report that the product in question contains no palm oil. :) I hope that this helps.Thanks - Lee
2590 2018-05-21 18:51:05 Na that would be stupid system in our case. Fuck have to vacuum the oil out instead of pole plugs now... fucking dumb thing ever. Takes an extra dam 30 mins just to get the oil out any more! Shit pisses me.
2591 2018-05-21 18:51:04 Please check the dollar-rupee exchange rate during #UPA(2004-2013) and now. . . #UPA left a loan of more than 40000 CR (on crude oil purchased from Iran) as a gift to @narendramodi. . .we need to pay in dollars Tweet with facts. . .
2592 2018-05-21 18:51:01 I could survive solely off French bread dipped in olive oil with lemon a lil bit of salt 
2593 2018-05-21 18:50:45 And ensuring Russian / SA & UAE oil prices never waver..
2594 2018-05-21 18:50:39 If ya wanna drive down healthcare costs AND gasoline costs...we have to create a Fed System for both. Not to eliminate capitalistic systems, but to definitely keep their ability to gouge us in check-

Kamala, where are you on new refineries & oil wells?
2595 2018-05-21 18:50:31 My mom is a fool for overestimating how much I love this discount silpancho we cook sometimes

"you won't finish it" i'll slurp even the cooking oil, test me
2596 2018-05-21 18:50:11 Actually it's an oil jihad by Islamic fundamentalist and every #nationalist must use other options. Options may be in ancient books of India.
2597 2018-05-21 18:50:02 Oh, it is sooo yummy just sautéed in some olive oil and very easy to grow. The flowers are beautiful!Good to know all the xtra health benefits.

On May 21 Israel / Palestine report: Oil Saudis worth hundreds of BILLIONS but never put a dime into improving Palestinean conditions. Why? Easier to blame Israel?
2599 2018-05-21 18:49:53 E tem gente que diz não haver monopólio. Falam tanto do "monopólio" da Standard Oil, que chegou a ter 75% da fatia do mercado no refino, mas esquecem que eles de fato vendiam num preço abaixo dos concorrentes.
2600 2018-05-21 18:49:22 It’s like snake oil
2601 2018-05-21 18:49:18 أخي اغتقد ما تشاء فلست أنا مكلف بأن ااغير معتقداتك. الف مرة قلت لكم امتياز أرامكو الحالي مدى العمر ليس محدد بزمن محدد ولم يصدر أي نظام جديد يلغي الامتياز قبل الطرح ولا يمكن تغيير مدة الامتياز بعد الطرح الا بالقوة (تأميم) وهذا لا يتماشى مع لروح العصر بل سيرفع ةقضايا ويسكبونها
2602 2018-05-21 18:49:08 As you see below, there is a very good reason people don't now use Nat Gas.  Range and lack of stations.  With my new engine in car that problem is solved.  New car might get 200 mpge and old Buick with engine might get 100 mpge.  Good enough.  You now are on Nat Gas, no oil.

2604 2018-05-21 18:48:52 We intend to challenge such claims-join us. It's like "data is an asset" & "data is the new oil." Best way to think about it: can anyone own a water molecule? Water is required for life, transport, power, and more. There are competing rights, but no ownership. Data is like this.
2605 2018-05-21 18:48:43 Sir you are increasing oil price but you have to think about poor farmers diesel is important for them
2606 2018-05-21 18:48:21 Go suck up to the zionist Israeli and evil USA.
They will destroy Iran for what it is and steal your Oil. Thats what they wish
The thing is not you MEK Californians want. Its what the majority pop of Iran want. They dont want Bars Brothels Wine Miniskirts of Shah time
2607 2018-05-21 18:47:56 Dear bhakt where are you..?? During the past 4 year Modi's government have collected huge amount of taxes on petrol and diesel and now

2615 2018-05-21 18:47:14 Saudi Arabia, Bronze Age murderous wankers. But they've got oil, so that's alright then.
2616 2018-05-21 18:47:07 I understand you. But I can’t be in a frying pan and decide to jump into fire because of the heat of the oil. Buhari and the entire APC had bo single credibility from the start. We failed as a nation.
2617 2018-05-21 18:47:06 The holes at the bottom of the food processor feeding tube are for dripping oil to make mayonnaise & emulsion sauces.
2618 2018-05-21 18:47:05 It wouldnt matter, if someone took the time to paint the post filter versiln with oil on a canvas, and was portrayed at the right gallery, it could be worth a solid amount of cash.
2619 2018-05-21 18:46:55 @CTV_PowerPlay Sir: Take issue with BC Premier Horgan, and his cabinet, who claim potential disastrous oil spill on the coast is ridiculous. The no ! oil producing nation in the world, Saudi-Arabia, has exported nearly all its oil by tanker for decades without problems.
2620 2018-05-21 18:46:49 What's amazing is the oil industry's vain attempts to find anything and everything they can to demonize Tesla and electric cars. If it's software, it can be fixed over the air by Tesla, right?
2621 2018-05-21 18:46:17 Nasusunog pala yung kasalanan kapag pinapahiran ng Holy Oil eh no? Hahaha. Sinners redeemed by Christ. 
2622 2018-05-21 18:46:07 Evidence on the relationship between population growth and oil consumption is pretty week.  It is urbanization and economic growth higher incomes) that matter.

2627 2018-05-21 18:45:35 Well I'd love to eat a whole cow, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'll stick to steak. Correct, olive and coconut oil is processed. Minimally. Doesn't mean to say it's unhealthy.
2628 2018-05-21 18:45:29 sometimes da oil pen jus be kickin u in the chest
2629 2018-05-21 18:45:15 Sear (with olive oil) skin down first until you have the line show on side then flip down another 3 min or so until to has color then flip back and cover with lid to steam for 5 min or so
2630 2018-05-21 18:45:13 But...but...but...what about the garlic & olive oil? The three hours of simmering? The little bit of tomato paste to make it thicker? 

I never even thought of butter. I'll try it out tonight!

2635 2018-05-21 18:44:44 What good will come out of the sanctions on this country. The President is going no where and with Russia and China backing it can survive the blip in oil price, and that is already changing.Sanctions only hurts those least able of helping themselves.

2644 2018-05-21 18:43:05 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.

2652 2018-05-21 18:42:12 Rising crude oil prices , weak rupee , trade war & BJP's loss. Nifty has no reason to go high now. Next level to watch will be 10630/10780. Go long only once these levels are broken. Overall outlook is neutral with slight negative bias.
2653 2018-05-21 18:42:06 abe chutiye jab international market me crude oil ka price badhega to yahan bhi to badhega
2654 2018-05-21 18:42:06 I already had the olive oil at home, anything else would have required going to the store

2656 2018-05-21 18:42:04 You look like a crude oil
2657 2018-05-21 18:42:00 Now they will say as usual Nehru Indira and Rajiv are responsible for oil price rise

2661 2018-05-21 18:41:36 A fair amount was just abject incompetence, rather than socialism per-se, although obviously there’s a strong link.

Oil wasn’t just “volatile” but also ineptly managed by Chavez & Maduro, who fired people who understood the industry & put in clueless comrades in PDVSA instead
2662 2018-05-21 18:41:29 Hahaha
And can you put up the crude oil prices also dude?
2663 2018-05-21 18:41:24 Dear uncle Sam, you just signed Another sanction on the government of Manduro, Venezuela has oil, Kenyan oil is yet to be drilled why didn't you do the same to Government of Kenya?

2677 2018-05-21 18:39:59 This is a domestic prophecy that has nothing to do with you Americans. Go protest resource development in California, which produces more emissions per barrel than the oil sands...
2678 2018-05-21 18:39:54 Population growth in developing and underdeveloped countries, economic growth which is related to your point of more income and innovating new uses of oil (e.g. crude to chemicals) defeat the peak demand theory.
2679 2018-05-21 18:39:26 Dilute the oils with water. I do  a 3/8th oil mixture to 5/8th water but experiment it and see what you like. Get good quality oils bro -- organic from a health store or Amazon not walmart. Bissel revolution is a great steam machine on Amazon too
2680 2018-05-21 18:39:21 avocado oil is a good one and can be used in high temperature cooking (like if you’re frying) and olive oil is always great for every day use
2681 2018-05-21 18:39:00 I didn't like the look for it that way next to your name. Oil and water

2685 2018-05-21 18:38:37 In #Venezuela today, both oil prices AND poverty are higher--by far--than when Hugo Chavez first took power.  That's quite a record of achievement right there...
2686 2018-05-21 18:38:36 Only problem is government never reduce oil prices when crude oil price goes down in international market but it always raise prices when it goes up. ( price reduction rate is slower then price increase)
2687 2018-05-21 18:38:33 Make a pizza! Use a base of sun-dried tomato oil and asiago, add grape tomato halves and pulled pork and bake. Top with chopped chives.

2690 2018-05-21 18:38:20 Wow. From the Oil session? (Going by the teabags)
2691 2018-05-21 18:37:44 I doubt the assumption that oil will not stay high for long.

Due to fall in prices, there was cut down in the investment by OPEC countries, it would take them some time to catch up with surging demands.

With Iran heading toward heavy US  sanctions, upside risks are even more.
2692 2018-05-21 18:37:44 With a motor oil reduction.

2706 2018-05-21 18:36:40 And how much of that debt is unnecessary wars chasing oil?
2707 2018-05-21 18:36:35 Is there any news that pushed oil up? ty
2708 2018-05-21 18:36:28 Through the laws of supply and demand. Unless #OPEC and its partner nations have their thumbs on the scale and are manipulating world oil markets. In which case, it doesn't matter how much oil the U.S. drills. The fix is in, and consumers pay every time.
2709 2018-05-21 18:36:27 I have only hypotheticals at this point. But Big Oil works w the US Dept of Energy and a coal guy funds Dr Keith. Both confirmed aerosol emitting. Makes sense to spray aerosolized cloud cover to band aid global warming, use up fossil fuels and kill off solar  @SEIA

2711 2018-05-21 18:36:21 Impossible! Please do not make any kind of promise. This is a national problem, the provinces can’t do anything. Too many powerful politicians have money invested in oil and gas and will never allow the price to fall. It also fills federal coffers.
2712 2018-05-21 18:36:18 Oil fan here. I agree.  Jets fans are great.  Quebec City fans would be great too.  I'd like Boston's owner to take a long hike off a short pier.  He thinks there are too many problems to award QC a team?  Really?  Justify the continuing existence of Carolina then.
2713 2018-05-21 18:36:17 Right! So if we have all this oil why is it not cheaper like in other countries that have a lot of oil?! Bs!
2714 2018-05-21 18:36:14 150 trillion bbl of oil reserves is the real wish list.
2715 2018-05-21 18:35:55 I'd be less annoyed about political promnoted tweets if we got some telling people to drag oil execs into the street.

2731 2018-05-21 18:34:37 The whole point of the movement against oil and gas is to shift the paradigm so we have kayaks, clothes, vehicles etc. available NOT using or made from petroleum and have the industry not so ubiquitous that everything depends on using the resource. #ableg #CDNpoli #oilandgas

2736 2018-05-21 18:34:04 No. I don’t mean any of what U say.    I mean more freedom for individuals & more scrutinyof/backlash against large harmful entities like big oil and religion, which @sapinker offers as examples.

2777 2018-05-21 18:29:52 @narendramodi ji, once you land, the first thing entire nation is expecting u is to instruct the fin ministry to cut excise duty on crude oil by 50%. They joyfully increased excise duty exorbitantly, but never bothered to reduce it. God knows why its not under gst.

2780 2018-05-21 18:29:39 @POTUS Please i beg you do not let them do off shore oil drilling off our coast here in Fla. We have the most beautiful beaches as you know. It would b detrimental not only to the environment but to Tourism which we highly depend on. Thank you.

2785 2018-05-21 18:29:04 If anything the Central excise. But Oil excise contributed 54% of Central excise revenues, up from 29 and 34% the previous two years. Excise contribution to total taxes also rose from 11 to 15% in 2016. Too vital to play with.

2790 2018-05-21 18:28:11 So you are admitting that it will increase every year irrespective of global crude oil price. But before 2014 NDA made us think the other way, for what?

2806 2018-05-21 18:26:23 I believe linseed oil.
2807 2018-05-21 18:26:19 What I meant is if it has a rose note that this probably isn't from  rose absolute or natural oil, but is a synthetic molecule or one of the component molecules in rose. If it says musk in the notes, where does it come from?
2808 2018-05-21 18:26:14 I was gonna do my own oil change buttt after watching a YouTube video I think ima have someone else do it lol

2810 2018-05-21 18:25:42 the president of Israel  hates Iran and suddenly Trump hates Iran? And Putin likes this because the oil prices are rising.

2815 2018-05-21 18:25:02 Thank you for sharing the link.

The only solution suggested w/in the article is “the best way to remove these impacts is to avoid development of energy systems in wildlands.” But what are the suggested solutions for *already existing* oil & gas fields?

2817 2018-05-21 18:24:54 When I talked to my doc about the dryness he suggested using kitchen stuff instead of lube...you know: olive oil, coconut oil, or CRISCO. Omg. Crisco.
2818 2018-05-21 18:24:52 @RepMarkMeadows Just wanted to ask you to pass a comment on to our President. "Thanks" for lifting regulations on oil production Mr. President. I live in CA. In January of this year Gov. Brown raised gas tax $.44 cents a gal, unleaded went to $2.59 a gal. Now gas is $3.69 a gal.
2819 2018-05-21 18:24:50 Also “not bad”? Seriously? With the largest reserves of oil in the world we have hyperinflation, no food, no medicines, no paper to print newspapers, a worrying amount of political imprisionments and every 20 min a Venezuelan is killed on the streets. “Not bad” is disheartening.
2820 2018-05-21 18:24:40 It's a long way down for the oil to go.
2821 2018-05-21 18:24:29 Christianity and Islam are just like water and oil... the two do not mix!
2822 2018-05-21 18:24:20 I think I finally realized why you Americans/especially Texans, love your country so much: Because you could be this dumb and STILL somehow provide for yourself and/or family. If I was this dumb, I'd give my left nutsack to fight in a foreign country for oil for this country 
2823 2018-05-21 18:24:14 Time to get a model S. Never fill up your gas tank again and instead of changing your oil every 5000 miles just refill your washer fluid.
2824 2018-05-21 18:24:14 Petroleum Minister has thrown ball in the Court of State Govt for Petroleum price control.Then what is his role ? Import crude at higher price & lubricate the oil companies ? If states are to control petrol prices then Crude Import should be done by state Govt’s not by Union Govt
2825 2018-05-21 18:24:13 Stilettos, water, and soap are like the ingredients for Oil and Water. They don't mix. Try Stunt work and at least you'll make a lot of money for shattering your spine. LOL
2826 2018-05-21 18:24:11 The pesto is wild garlic, sun dried tomato, Za'atar, olive oil, lemon juice and salt.

2828 2018-05-21 18:23:58 So right Katie. Unfortunately governments are putting cheap oil and what not above the security of their people. I bet national governments would try and hide the truth of their dealings to try and save face with their people.
2829 2018-05-21 18:23:57 The United States of America has More Oil than the whole world but together!!!! The five Northern State's, and more! Check it out!!

2836 2018-05-21 18:23:08 I personally dont find any rationale for higher oil prices globally .. It is artificially pumped up. Its speculative out there. Opinions are personal and subjective. Pardon me. Tweet not intended to hurt anyone.
2837 2018-05-21 18:22:59 So peanut oil
2838 2018-05-21 18:22:57 I often think it's either about ancient rights over land or simply because of possible financial gain such as Oil etc. It's amazing that millions of people have died in the name of who's imaginary God is the best.
2839 2018-05-21 18:22:51 Oil? No that’s the work of Satan
2840 2018-05-21 18:22:46 I didn't vote for either binary candidate, but his policies are good for the US, and the continuous onslaught from progressives in media and social media have made it so I won't vote for anyone else, as long as he continues with the conservative policies as he has been doing.
2841 2018-05-21 18:22:42 Our auto industry and oil industries bought most of our rail system and scuttled them yrs ago, public transportation is uber, and they have to pay for gas.
2842 2018-05-21 18:22:40 Yeah, coconut oil is super good for you. I just throw that in, let it melt cuz I am too lazy to clean a blender. Haha.
2843 2018-05-21 18:22:29 His dependence on oil and letting the right walk over him ... he is too nice

2847 2018-05-21 18:22:06 Non oil GDP grew by 0.76% so essentially, GDP growth is powered by rise in oil prices. If I say what I want to say, you people will call me a hater therefore, I will not say it.

2854 2018-05-21 18:21:28 Not everything is America's fault. Chavez and Maduro bet on oil remaining expensive in perpetuity, and that was a bad bet. It's not complicated.
2855 2018-05-21 18:21:27 Now see here is argue all wars were about greed. Land, wealth,  oil, water, gold politics .....very rarely is actually about souls. The label is just the excuse used.
2856 2018-05-21 18:21:20 The 5% that the local community has been allocated in the Kenyan Oil Deal. Who will be the custodian of that money? and how will we be sure the locals will get to access that money without other people wanting to grab it? #KenyanTurkanaOilDeal
2857 2018-05-21 18:21:20 I think it was in 2016 when the Middle East started slashing production of oil because it had become to plentiful (US had also increased its domestic production of oil) and prices per barrel were starting to drop. So they slowed production, and demand/prices naturally rose after.
2858 2018-05-21 18:21:05 As if the political drama was not enough, rising crude price is hurting market sentiment further.

Oil has hit a three-and-a-half year high of $80 per barrel, thanks to a number of reasons, mostly geopolitical. Analysts r now reworking their price target with some estimating $100
2859 2018-05-21 18:20:59 boy he is under pressure as looting with all the oil money would not be possible anymore, Russia has a say in world oil trade, prices will rise until year end and he knows state elections are also round the corner, ye apne liye gaya hai russia.
2860 2018-05-21 18:20:57 Useless sanctions that will harm USA more than IRAN because the world is far more economically open than 40 years ago. The option of war will be a disaster for Israel & USA first & for the world economy cause of oil.

2862 2018-05-21 18:20:55 Faulk is much better with the puck on his stick than Klefbom. If Klefbom was the player you think he is then the Oil wouldn't need a puck moving defenseman capable of QBing a PP. Klefbom isn't even the best defenseman on the team.
2863 2018-05-21 18:20:34 Well not oil specifically
2864 2018-05-21 18:20:33 People ,acche din for oil companies. Chalo bhai apni apni cycle nikalo. Kam se kam health toh acchi rahegi. # fuel prices on fire
2865 2018-05-21 18:20:25 Where is your "facts" to support YOUR claim that oil is biggest wealth creator & that IT is trying to shut down the industry!
Back up your claims before crossing others.
2866 2018-05-21 18:20:20 Whole idea of deregulation was to reduce losses for oil PSU. Now these PSU is sitting on huge cash reserve. Gov can take a call to reduce taxes which will surely reduce prices ?

2869 2018-05-21 18:19:28 If only deer produced something useful like whale oil, maybe we would have hunted them to extinction a hundred years ago.
2870 2018-05-21 18:19:27 Oil prices not political commercial aspect ? When crude prices were low Gov maintained prices of old price regime Why Gov not reduced prices proportionately ? i:e; the reason let’s call political too After all ordinary man only burdened by this meaningless higher tax regime
2871 2018-05-21 18:19:19 So what has it got to do with USA? They want the Oil of course!
2872 2018-05-21 18:19:12 Nigeria's GDP grew by 1.95% in the first quarter of 2018 marking the 4th consecutive positive expansion since the first quarter of 2017. Strong oil receipts, stable foreign exchange market and steady rise in non-oil activity have helped this continuous growth

2875 2018-05-21 18:19:00 I agree with you on diversity. I believe that Gadaffi was in control of his country's oil, and he did very well in improving the lives of his people, and he was eventually killed for it. Every African leader who has disagreed with terms of the western powers got killed.
2876 2018-05-21 18:18:58 Not only does coal have no future, but either does oil. Basically, our government should be creating solar panels and geothermal grout production facilities in the oil patch and other mining areas to re-train people for the future.

2881 2018-05-21 18:17:55 There is an abundance of other options than selling oil by oil tanker through Metro Vancouver, the Inlet, the Coast of BC like meeting declining Alaska volumes by replacing that supply for the Pacific NW or refining product in Alberta for current North American needs.

2885 2018-05-21 18:17:26 Everybody thinks paying $15 per hour will eliminate poverty and be a living wage. Who dreams up such nonsense? My advice is learn a trade that pays and is in demand, like embalming or cremation. Or auto mechanics who know computer technology, and change oil.
2886 2018-05-21 18:17:25 To control import of crude oil Government have to give 100 percent subsidy to ac bus n improve public transport

2900 2018-05-21 18:16:08 Oh no it for sure is for greed! I just was letting your fan know that Summer blend, surprisingly to me, is a real thing. The greed comes from OPEC and giant oil conglomerates like Exxon Mobile who profit off these higher prices. Also the US’ growth in producing oil.

No subsidy was given when oil price dropped $35/45  from $120 per barrel in 2016 and now it has increased @$60 per barrel. So what do we expect?
Its because of gujarat and karnataka election the government havn't increased the price

2928 2018-05-21 18:13:33 plus india need  to cut oil import. high prices have 2 effect, make investment in  domestic oil exploration and renewable energy attractive.

plus highway constructed from fuel cess will decrease oil consumption making travel faster and cheaper and decreasing congestion
2929 2018-05-21 18:13:27 That's definitely possible, but far more likely that a decade of purchasing food while oil prices were high caused the domestic economy to be unable to provide nearly enough food to feed the people, not a secret opp.

2960 2018-05-21 18:10:29 Ok the subsidy is on cooking gas /Kerosene which also falls under petroleum product. Whereas petrol and diesels are deregulate which means its price is controlled by oil company based on market price. And I may be wrong here but thats what is my understanding.

2969 2018-05-21 18:10:02 Okay. I'll fetch the cooking oil then.

Hot US heads are going right to war with more mess and desolation in the Middle East than before, just for zionists interests. Oil prices will quickly go up to make happy #Russia and #Iran & put recession to american economy
2977 2018-05-21 18:09:31 Why do taxpayers subsidize any company? Gas and oil come to mind and they spend millions lobbying Congress! Also Boeing, Goldman Sachs, Northrop Grumman and on and on and on....
2978 2018-05-21 18:09:25 I`m not brand loyal btw! I love the purdy pro extra for oil.
2979 2018-05-21 18:09:22 There’s no doubt about it that drop in Venezuela’s oil production has been an important element of the rise in global prices for oil along with worsening conditions in the Middle East. Looking forward to the oil prices above the $100 point this year.
2980 2018-05-21 18:09:22 Ppl say @astitvam that oil price increased. Ppl dot ask how stone pelting reducing how my country developing, where does Modi get money foey for that , without making debts from imf or from world bank
2981 2018-05-21 18:09:21 Lol your points are literally all over the place. Border control to just attackinf me? I don’t claim to be an expert?? When did I do that? Just making some observations as an outsider. Sometimes it’s hard to see things objectively when you’re living in it.
2982 2018-05-21 18:09:20 I need a new piece of subdermal plastic, and Wally needs new oil. I WILL MAKE THESE APPOINTMENTS AND STOP PUTTING IT OFF SHUT UP ANXIETY.
2983 2018-05-21 18:09:20 Coconut oil & good D are the solution to a lot of problems & that’s truth. 
2984 2018-05-21 18:09:20 Great news!  Could you please sell them more corn and get the oil refiner to stop making ethanol!  Consumers hate ethanol because it mess...
2985 2018-05-21 18:09:18 @ShogrenE, curious if you spoke with the vet about survival rates for your article: "Why Dawn..."? The news cameras love it & animal lovers feel compelled (how could we not), but the priority needs to be on more effective spill response to prevent contact w/ oil in the 1st place.

2992 2018-05-21 18:09:00 Put a tiny dab of clove oil onto a cotton bud and hold it onto it for about 20-30 seconds at a time. Worked for me! Don’t use too much though or your mouth will burn like the depths of hell
2993 2018-05-21 18:08:57 In a sense you gave up a lazy high paid winger who wasn't a top line or even 2nd line wing for Oil, & in exchange got a top end winger to play with 97, paid the same as Ebs, & a 3rd line C much much cheaper than RNH, albeit a slight downgrade in that support role.
2994 2018-05-21 18:08:54 Yes. I want this.

2996 2018-05-21 18:08:47 2b clear on $wtic oil, setup is forming 4 pb based on techs and divergences across multiple TFs. But keep in mind, like Im, this is a commodity so they may 1st crack all those then pull the rug. In past 10 yrs that has not happened. This time its different, Im told by oil bulls.
2997 2018-05-21 18:08:45 Because scrapping the Iran deal 
causes an oil supply shortage 
This increases the cost of oil charged by guess who?
Russia and Saudi Arabia.

Aren’t these the same governments that “interfered” with the 2016 election that helped @realDonaldTrump win the Presidency?
Payback?

3005 2018-05-21 18:07:46 Unless a rightwing puppet is elected so they can be in charge of Venezuela’s oil the West will not approve of the election results.
3006 2018-05-21 18:07:46 Oil is becauming redundant in the modern world. Renewable energy gives the world an alternative to the power oil, and the fanatics that hold it. Hidroelectric, biogas, natural gas, are cleaner and NOT in the hands of terror supporting countries. There is alternatives.

3028 2018-05-21 18:05:02 Prove the thesis that there can be no rational public trade of cash for picks. Make it be publicly understood that such trades are invariably snake oil. This has been done before in other markets as customers realized they were being ripped off.
3029 2018-05-21 18:05:02 If this was 1980 we’d have time for a gradual transition. Millions spent by oil industry on Disinformation has blown that chance. We are already at 400ppm of GHGs and going up fast. MUCH faster than scientists predicted. We act now, or we pay in forest fires, floods, hurricanes.
3030 2018-05-21 18:04:51 Yes if you search #rafflesiainoxford you can see a 3D oil painting I did of the world’s largest flower 
3031 2018-05-21 18:04:23 Agreed. I am sure they are happy that oil prices are helping them in their quest for higher inflation but they have no clue how damaging this one sided rampant speculation in oil is for the economy.

Simple, enabling Natural Gas as the fuel.  But we already have Nat Gas cars and they don't work well, you say.  Correct.  But why?

Range. You need 3-6 times better range.  My engine can do that.  

Tesla gets 100 mpge.  My engine 200 mpge on NG

Peanut oil is an allergen.

3097 2018-05-21 17:59:03 Without knowing reason, plz do not misguide peoples. Petrol prices is dependent on crude oil which is now more than 80. Just compare crude price in congress govt with petrol price then u will b knowing who is better.

3099 2018-05-21 17:58:56 omg no honestly i feel u i had aploecia for years! just don't dye it anymore and get some coconut oil on it
3100 2018-05-21 17:58:50 Dear Chetan Bhakt do you know at present the rate of tax levied is highest & crude oil price is not as high as during UPA rule.
3101 2018-05-21 17:58:46 As if these Congichors were holding reigns of Saudi Kingdom their hands and could buy Oil for free
3102 2018-05-21 17:58:38 That’s cool! What does it do with oil?
3103 2018-05-21 17:58:38 Cuba has already pillaged most of it with the nonsense free oil giveaways by its corrupt puppet dictatorship in Venezuela.
3104 2018-05-21 17:58:35 Funny how this works...  There are people who want to clean up the USA and corrupt UN nonsense.  They spend 100's of millions to donate to corrupt pols who do zero.  Those same people won't even engage in a conversation about how to finally make people independent from oil...why?
3105 2018-05-21 17:58:34 Being a member of the EU but outside of the UK means that in time you don't have to rely on rUK buying your produce, but even better it means that all that tax goes towards your country instead of pished up against the wall by Westminster (see oil)
3106 2018-05-21 17:58:27 i hope you get some sleep, i put lavender oil on my pillow, it is very relaxing
3107 2018-05-21 17:58:25 If Donald Trump had stated during his campaign that he would be the subservient of Netanyahu, he would send your Money in foreign bank accounts, he would have neglected the entire Middle east market with the second oil producer and the first gas producer of the planet
3108 2018-05-21 17:58:20 It's Show-Me 100 week at Lucas Oil Speedway...:)
3109 2018-05-21 17:58:08 I am more concerned about selling the Chinese ANY of our natural resources!  Let them find their own oil and natural gas.  It is very alarming as to how much of the world’s natural resources they have accumulated under the radar.
3110 2018-05-21 17:58:01 Have you tried putting fish in the food press? Fish makes oil coal makes tar and spoiled meat makes ichor or w/e you can also cook blue fish for ichor
3111 2018-05-21 17:57:51 Its more collusion, this time with scummy greedy oil companies in order to rape the average American. Always happens when a republican is in charge.They're all in bed together
3112 2018-05-21 17:57:45 Just like her dad, Ivanka went into a high end business she knew nothing about, but dad had taught her about money laundering & that became her back story. However, like all the Trumps, she went broke. Not to worry, she tried to dabble in the oil industry, again she failed.
3113 2018-05-21 17:57:34 おやおや？？ならチャンスありということだ
3114 2018-05-21 17:57:33 Unfortunately, most of those efforts are futile. Very few "cleaned" wildlife survive or subsequently mate. The news cameras love it, and animal lovers feel compelled (how could we not), but the priority needs to be on more effective #spillresponse to prevent contact with oil.
3115 2018-05-21 17:57:33 i thought china's trying to make CNY an international currency via CNY commodities markets (oil, iron, gold). how's this tie in to IMFs SDR?
3116 2018-05-21 17:57:25 Tomorrow I'll be attempting a livestream through Youtube; I've got a preliminary charcoal drawing of Gollum to start work on for a future oil painting so that will be the content! More info to follow soon...

3117 2018-05-21 17:57:24 The left is NEVER consistent. It’s always the party of “do what I say, not as I do”
3118 2018-05-21 17:57:16 Alberta has the highest per capita spending in Canada.  There IS a spending problem.  The solution to balanced budgets is to set spending based on low oil prices and consider high prices as windfall that shouldn't be spent, but saved.
3119 2018-05-21 17:57:08 On that note, can we cut out OPEC and use our oil reserves inside the states? If anything, just to prove a point?
3120 2018-05-21 17:56:59 แงงงงง นี่ชอบคอลเล็คชั่นปากหงุมหงิมกับหน้ากระจกของน้องมากๆ
3121 2018-05-21 17:56:53 Someone threw a bottle of omega 3 pills at me! Luckily my injuries were only super fish oil.
3122 2018-05-21 17:56:47 #IMX2018 attendees, visit us at the MNI Diesel booth to learn how Puradyn filtration can extend oil change intervals by up to 90% and increase engine life.
3123 2018-05-21 17:56:46 Honestly if Trump sold any kind of oil, it would sell a lot more than Hilary's failed book. #hillaryforprison
3124 2018-05-21 17:56:40 Try coconut oil.
3125 2018-05-21 17:56:40 Also total debt at Indian Oil Corp. stood at Rs419 billion ($6.2 billion) at the end of Sept'17, down from Rs863 billion in Mar'14. Also mam if I hv read correct news..India has already paid $5.2 billion oil debts to Iran.
3126 2018-05-21 17:56:34 Der s an argument dt centre wont reduce taxes for petrol bcz taxes r used for development. Bt state should reduce VAT - as if VAT is nt used for development by states LOL.If Indian ecnomy has to realy grow, cntrol the Interest Margin of banks nd Refining Margins of oil companies.
3127 2018-05-21 17:56:33 Baby oil!!!!
3128 2018-05-21 17:56:27 Ladies and Gents, your political problems are BASED in OIL.  The corrupt dollar is based in OIL.  All the cartels are based in OIL.

Reason would stand, that if you can get 80-95% of the OIL gone, you can UNPLUG the people fighting Trump.  HOW?  READ the TWEETS.
3129 2018-05-21 17:56:20 So a woman killing a human life inside her is fine with you?
3130 2018-05-21 17:56:12 Ok, Chicken Little, explain how. Because every credible forecasting agency predicts oil consumption will continue to grow well past 2040. Furthermore, Canadians disagree with you. Polling data shows 60-70% of us want a gradual transition to a low-carbon economy. What about that?
3131 2018-05-21 17:56:09 予定空いてないと無理だけれども
3132 2018-05-21 17:56:04 And OPEC waited till  #KarnatakaElections voting day to reduce oil production. Hence no change/increase in prices rill than.
3133 2018-05-21 17:56:01 Pretty sure Meeko didn’t oil her scalp.
3134 2018-05-21 17:56:00 There is still a lot more otherwise England would dump Scotland. I wonder when England will drill its own oil
3135 2018-05-21 17:55:58 Trump is the one who loves war..He admitted it at a rally in the summer of 2016..He also said if he had been Bush he would have bombed the sht out of Iraq and stole all their oil..#SMH
3136 2018-05-21 17:55:46 I bought small oil paintings from street artists; I’m sure it’s touristy, but there are many to choose from at Montmartre.
3137 2018-05-21 17:55:31 The blind idiocy of Trumpers has never amazed me. He's a con man, a snake oil salesman.
3138 2018-05-21 17:55:28 遊びに行くかぁ
3139 2018-05-21 17:55:25 So you’re against @PPact I take it??

3141 2018-05-21 17:55:15 1. Soldiers getting killed at the  border
2. Oil prices through the roofs
3. Virus outbreak in Kerala
But guess what @republic wants to talk about? A remote church says some shit about the "messaiah" modi.

3142 2018-05-21 17:55:11 Looks like she did and oil change !!
3143 2018-05-21 17:55:11 Overall, I am bearish on TSLA, however much higher oil price could rapidly change its outlook. Watching how this plays-out.
3144 2018-05-21 17:55:07 I meant their oil.
3145 2018-05-21 17:54:59 I read the economic "section" because I make political choices for the welfare of my family. Not choices based on "hope", promises and false projections of oil revenues.
If you believe it was a good honest true prospectus you are deluded.
3146 2018-05-21 17:54:53 Bouta go get my oil changed
3147 2018-05-21 17:54:44 You r right but where were all the funds going. No known purchase defense hardware, infra, or deveopmental works. Even at this rate, oil companies had to subsidised thousands of crores.
3148 2018-05-21 17:54:43 Gas prices spiked when Trump put sanctions back on Iran so they can't sell oil on international markets. Another reason is the unrest caused by moving the U.S. embassy  to Palestine which increased geopolitical risks.

3152 2018-05-21 17:54:28 It is believed Amelia Earhart & her navigator, Fred Noonan, were the 1st two overall casualties of WWII as they were killed by the Japanese on Nikumaroro, the 3rd American was an underage teenage boy who fought in the Battle of Britain in the RAF. Oil could've precipitated it.
3153 2018-05-21 17:54:26 I sent a photo of this breast massage oil to a bunch of my girlfriends and of course my capricorn friend responded “ew lol.” #classiccapricorn
3154 2018-05-21 17:54:19 Shaking in their oil drenched sandals, the Saudi patriarchy are scared of the feminine spirit, and this is why they choke women behind veils in a scorching desert. The guardianship system is a scourge on humanity and it must be vanquished. #saudi #metoo #feminism #feminist
3155 2018-05-21 17:54:02 There oil is very low grade as well, they have tons of it because it’s not in as high of demand Brent blend or sweet crude
3156 2018-05-21 17:53:58 I also find it interesting that to solve the political problems you have to solve the energy problem, yet few WAKE UP and want to even ask questions.... 

The POWER of the Politically CORRUPT is BASED IN OIL....WAKE UP.  Unplug OIL and you UNPLUG the stinking DEEP STATE.
3157 2018-05-21 17:53:49 Maybe elegik tea tree oil,
But not to aloevera,
I should stay w aloevera
3158 2018-05-21 17:53:31 You need vote and tax from the people ! When crude oil is rising why don't you reduce the heavy tax on petrol and Diesel to provide relief to the people ? How much tax is being collected in a litre of petrol ? Only give us vote always !
3159 2018-05-21 17:53:30 Why can’t I just go in for an oil change without the mechanic trying to get me to buy / fix all this stuff for my car 
3160 2018-05-21 17:53:27 Lisa, I agree with Tess as long as you are on antibiotics. Clove oil is EXCELLENT for pain related to abscesses, dry sockets, gum pain, etc. Tastes bad but when you’re in pain, who cares. If you like cloves you’re n luck. However, better than OTC Anbesol. Best of luck-feel better
3161 2018-05-21 17:53:20 some dude legit grabbed me because i said i wasn’t interested in buying his oil 
3162 2018-05-21 17:53:15 lower to 7. cake was a bit dry. needed more egg or oil.
3163 2018-05-21 17:53:06 I know. Haha. That's what you get when a character starts a movie by blowing up oil rigs and ends it by giving an impassioned Wikipedia recital of the subject of climate change.
3164 2018-05-21 17:53:05 @BBCRadio2 #DriveTime Stopped trying to listen to the new format, it’s beyond dreary. All fun and excitement has gone, pairing two great DJs doesn’t work when what they offer is poles apart. @jowhiley had an excellent show as did @simonmayo. It’s like trying to mix oil and water.

3166 2018-05-21 17:53:03 If I take the time to oil up, put on something sexy (or nothing at all), and take pics or a video for you, I’m going to need more than some damn emojis as a response. Hype. Me. Up.
3167 2018-05-21 17:52:50 I gotta get an oil change this week 
3168 2018-05-21 17:52:45 Yes, That is what Zinke's BLM is for as their new insignia shows: for Zinke, public lands are for welfare ranchers as well as oil-gas-coal.  Like Reagan, he see too many trees as a problem to be solved.
3169 2018-05-21 17:52:38 You must get your basics right !! the Crude Oil price is far less than previous governments. Hard earned money after all income taxes are literally exhausted out of small pockets where as big players are making huge money. SHAME
3170 2018-05-21 17:52:29 I voted democrat,but my vote Not Accounted.we Americans people’s,we don’t have a right anymore.after trump be president. Trump win my a deal to Russia to Iran oil.We are nation,not anymore.Russia,Iran, China,and North Korea together.WE GONNA HAVE A WAR WAR 3.
3171 2018-05-21 17:52:22 CBD oil should be here today. Really hoping this works. I’m at my wits end with my sleep struggles
3172 2018-05-21 17:52:12 Yeah, I agree with a lot here.  I still think (hope?) that US and EU can figure out a middle ground on Iran that avoids sanx and countermeasures. It’s really in best interests of both. Big EU firms are pulling back anyway, which gives US more of what it wants; oil is the key
3173 2018-05-21 17:52:04 You're not free to break the law, but you do have the right to have an attorney.  With rights come responsibilities.  You have the right to make bad choices, but you don't have the right to escape the consequences.
3174 2018-05-21 17:51:50 Every time I get the oil change the SAME salesman tries to get me to trade in my car & every time I tell him I'll do it if he pays Fidge's tuition. He hasn't taken me up on my offer yet.
3175 2018-05-21 17:51:48 No one knows bougie until you met my sister. lil Bih pays $5 extra just for her fries to be fried in truffle oil. I can’t decide if she’s extra or just enjoys the good things in life ?? LOL idk but the fries were 10 times better I won’t lie
3176 2018-05-21 17:51:47 What subsidy ? There is so much room to reduce tax and vat so that oil price can be reduced
3177 2018-05-21 17:51:34 Nonsense? Really? Had Canada's oil resources been nationalized, it would have been possible for certainly the oil-producing provinces and perhaps the federal government to enjoy long-term even future benefits as has Norway. No good comes from privatizing oil reserves.
3178 2018-05-21 17:51:34 Oh yeah- getting an oil change this weekend- $35- cover it! #paypig #cashslave

3179 2018-05-21 17:51:28 Ian wood who was the most respected at the time said it was far too ambitious and no he wasn't a Sir in 2014 .

What's for sure is a yes in 2014 would have us £8bn in the red from lack of oil tax revenues. Can't argue that one its a fact proven by time

3185 2018-05-21 17:50:52 In essence, yes.  You said what women do is not your business.  So if that's true, then what they do to protect themselves isn't your business either.  Pick a side, just be consistent.
3186 2018-05-21 17:50:37 Show me the coconut oil
3187 2018-05-21 17:50:35 Get you a man who’ll oil your scalp and twist your hair.

3189 2018-05-21 17:50:25 , even in Takoradi, when crude oil was found, landlords and landladies increase rent rates up to 200% and till date,
3190 2018-05-21 17:50:22 Snake oil. Psychotropic medication is largely experimental, and has significant side effects. Misdiagnosis of depression is commonplace. As is ‘diagnosis’ of withdrawal symptoms as psychosis. Research to support this. I never invent.
3191 2018-05-21 17:50:22 I wonder what Scott proposes when Trump really goes after the states on the East coast to let oil drilling start up. He is the last person I would trust to fight Trump on this.  As the gas prices continue to go sky high there will be a lot of pressure put on these Governors.
3192 2018-05-21 17:50:22 North Dakotans, Race to your nearest public lands and be ready to protect them. Zinke will be leasing them to oil-coal-gas.
3193 2018-05-21 17:50:09 it's not as much as you'd think for WWE with the price of body oil climbing

3223 2018-05-21 17:47:41 será por la compra de OIL?
3224 2018-05-21 17:47:35 We are the largest USA Bulk and Wholesale Suppliers of Zero THC Full Spectrum Hemp Oil, Hemp Derived Pure CBD, Organic Hemp CBD, CBDA, CBG oil, CBN oil, CBC oil, Full Spectrum CBD Oil,
3225 2018-05-21 17:47:31 I believe in a YouTube video @VeraBambiLIVE said that's what she does is basically slather herself in coconut oil.
3226 2018-05-21 17:47:16 We don’t need it in their case. Venezuela main industry is oil. They have the largest reserves in the world. However it’s very heavy and the only refiners in the world capable of handling are in the USA. As such we have them where we want them.
3227 2018-05-21 17:47:15 higher oil prices would have a myriad of unexpected consequences. I can accept that $TSLA bulls would attempt to use that to push their narrative and scare shorts (which are a hard to bully, savvy bunch, btw). 

Either way, summer 2018 will be a binary event for Elon et al.

Gas prices went up all over the US, with higher prices in states with stricter environmental laws (gas is has extra crap in it $$) and is taxed at a higher rate to pay for environmental clean up, etc.
3230 2018-05-21 17:47:03 "It smells like cardamom oil." -Jesse
3231 2018-05-21 17:47:01 BTW Alastair you told us we'd have to rely on the union to protect us economically - so why is the economic situation worse? PS oil is 80$ a barrel and rising
3232 2018-05-21 17:46:59 Long history of Europens cooking and frying in olive oil of course
3233 2018-05-21 17:46:59 Go to a flower shop and purchase some rose petals, go to 99c store get those small battery candle lights,get some aromatic massg oil ,go to Stbcks get some Exprso  brownies and Vanilla H&D IC  get some white sheets and pillow cases , let your imagination make a perfect night
3234 2018-05-21 17:46:58 Don’t worry money talks .. with another billion of that oil money ya’ll will eventually buy UCL aswell. Till thn let us have our moment!!
3235 2018-05-21 17:46:41 Absolutely. CLOVE OIL is a freaking miracle Lisa. No joke. It’s sold at most stores (Walmart/CVS/Walgreens/etc) & it’s not expensive. It has natural numbing & antibiotic properties. I had an awful abscess once & it was a miracle. I’ll say a prayer you feel better! Sorry!
3236 2018-05-21 17:46:25 Iran does not trade oil in $ or £.
3237 2018-05-21 17:46:16 Total debt at Indian Oil Corp. stood at Rs419 billion ($6.2 billion) at the end of Sept'17, down from Rs863 billion in Mar'14. Also mam if I hv read correct news..India has already paid $5.2 billion oil debts to Iran
Besides mam it's varying state govt. Taxes dt raises the price+
3238 2018-05-21 17:46:09 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, however benefits magnet.
3239 2018-05-21 17:46:06 We have higher gas prices because we don't have interstate trade with refined oil. Cheaper states carry the crude without borders. At least we don't have railway accidents like Alabama with crude spill.
3240 2018-05-21 17:45:57 There is no smell. I spritz my hair with home made essential oil waters  - grapefruit/rose
3241 2018-05-21 17:45:56 Step 2 :Form round shaped meatballs
Step 3 :Heat up oil in the pan
Step 4 : Add ground onions in the oil and fry
Step 5 :As onions turn brown, add white cumin and garlic and fry for 2 to 3 minutes
Step 6 :Add salt, chili powder, turmeric powder and coriander powder
3242 2018-05-21 17:45:44 Like keep reforesting where it was cleared for oil extraction, and ffs someone’s gotta clean up the factories dumping raw sewage

3245 2018-05-21 17:45:24 Check your Transmission oil this morning.
3246 2018-05-21 17:45:18 That would be a sensible wish, for a sensible result. It still leaves the question as to what the sensible regulation(s) would be in her mind, to get the desired result.
3247 2018-05-21 17:45:15 Also add the data for per barrel oil price in these years. That will add the brilliance of Our Modi Ji.
3248 2018-05-21 17:45:13 Ingredient Watch: Brominated vegetable oil ("BVO") in your sodas this May? This flame retardant can be used to prevent separation.
3249 2018-05-21 17:45:10 Cover me in olive oil and handcuff me to a policeman.
3250 2018-05-21 17:45:07 We will just continue sitting here smug with no shooting sprees in our schools. As far as I can tell, the majority of your shootings are from white men... not sure what border control has to do with it 
3251 2018-05-21 17:45:03 @bamabroker oil to 2015 levels. Morgan Stanley already commented that a third of tax cut gains have been spent at the pump. Should be half by end of the month. Should be 100% by July. You really think @realDonaldTrump will let Jim Bob start losing money into the midterms
3252 2018-05-21 17:45:03 Because it turned out to be snake oil
3253 2018-05-21 17:45:01 Oil is old technology and is killing the planet. We have to transition away from it NOW. Not next year, NOW. That means NO new oil infrastructure.  The science is clear. Humanity has a choice. Adapt or die.
3254 2018-05-21 17:44:58 I believe that. I also believe that other energy technologies have long done and will continue to do likewise, including nuclear, smart grids, conservation, hydrogen and yes lower-carbon oil and natural gas as well. Not all about one solution.
3255 2018-05-21 17:44:28 Yup !!! Even Basil , olive oil , onion  can help it too !!!
3256 2018-05-21 17:44:19 Step 1 : Add onions, salt, red chili, coriander powder, turmeric powder, green coriander, mint, green chili, oil and gram flour; mix them and grind in food chopper
3257 2018-05-21 17:44:08 What I attempted to say was whoa nelly! Don’t put the cart before the horse. The post was all hype on a person that’s done zero zip nada to date in any capacity in the NFL. Let’s put away the anointing oil and wait to see if he possesses any of the leadership traits first.
3258 2018-05-21 17:44:06 Grandma Marie's doctors gave her 2 months. But seeing her on Mother's Day I could tell she's got a lot more than 2 mo. Lonny went and got her CBD oil and a vaping pen and it's helped. She was so hesitant on doing either but she's more scared of dying than trying this method.
3259 2018-05-21 17:44:02 @lukemburgess #NOW THAT CHINA WILL NOT LET OIL IMPORTS BE PAID FOR WITH THE US DOLLAR WHERE IS THE BEST PLAY!? CHINA ONLY ALLOWS THE YUAN OR PHYSICAL GOLD TO BUY IMPORT OIL PER THERE NEW LAW THAT JUST STARTED! NO PAPER GOLD EITHER ! THE CHINES YUAN OR PHYSICAL GOLD! WHAT'S PLAY?
3260 2018-05-21 17:43:45 Sanctions against individuals close to Putin are good but there are ways around them. 
Everyone of Putin cronies affected will get reimbursed by the Russian taxpayers.

Only low oil prices and refusal to buy Russian gas by EU can lead to collapse of Putin regime.
3261 2018-05-21 17:43:44 Meanwhile I'm dumping half a bottle of olive oil over my meal like I'm Jamie Oliver AND A LIL' DRIZZLE FOR FLAVOUR OIGHT THAT FANTASTIC MMM
3262 2018-05-21 17:43:42 OPEC deal to limit their production allows oil price to rise to current level. Also sanctions on Iran. If these go, there’d be a glut again.
3263 2018-05-21 17:43:40 Most affectionate and loyal. Yeah, they are high strung, but they are the best little doggos ever. I was a big dog fan until I got our low riders. They are amazing. Best alarms and most protective too.

3265 2018-05-21 17:43:29 y quién querías que sea? Oil? jajajaja 
3266 2018-05-21 17:43:23 In 1953 CIA overthrew the democratic elected government of Iran and installed a puppet leader who called himself the "Shah" of Iran. The operation called "operation Ajax". The Shah put the oil back into the hands of these western oil companies.
3267 2018-05-21 17:43:20 Prophet, I was praying last night in my closet for my focus and I asked Jesus to let you know how I was feeling (not that great mentally) and then You come on early this morning lit with the oil of joy!!!!. I thank you Jesus for answered prayer!! Prophet your not human!
3268 2018-05-21 17:43:20 Our gasoline prices are going up because the price of oil is going up due to increased global demand and the futures market. A refinery, which cracks crude to make gasoline, must purchase the crude. It really is that simple, bro.
3269 2018-05-21 17:43:16 Please explain how your non-understanding of the oil industry relates to Hillary Clinton? I’ll wait...
3270 2018-05-21 17:43:16 Will natural gas price climb higher. ? Seems, crude oil and Brent been moving higher.
3271 2018-05-21 17:43:12 ha I think a peak oil would be would be easier. Just check some bank accounts and pollution records.
3272 2018-05-21 17:43:07 It’s only 2:00 and I’ve gotten so much accomplished. Got my oil changed, got my nails done, got a part time job, paid some bills.
3273 2018-05-21 17:42:48 Can you believe the nerve of the man - the economic situation is worse .What happened to the broad shoulders etc? Why is it worse? Cos we're still part of the union.He nearly talked about oil price but then changed hiss mind cos oil is now 80$ a barrel.
3274 2018-05-21 17:42:46 Need to get a car wash & oil change on my off days this week..
3275 2018-05-21 17:42:43 ありがとです！
3276 2018-05-21 17:42:34 You need oil money to break the bank for such players 
They ain't cheap in this market 
Even though we have spent a lot but general question can we afford to buy Salah?

3279 2018-05-21 17:42:28 tell Sophie we need Oil of Every Pearl’s Un-Insides already
3280 2018-05-21 17:42:27 After we pillaged all the gold in the world, we created the petrodollar. War goes on! Big oil is trying to stop solar panels w/ tariffs, but electric cars are going to be hard to stop; meanwhile we have to stop plastic bottles at the local level.
3281 2018-05-21 17:42:24 Time to open up the SPR as a counter-cyclical force against oil speculators.

3285 2018-05-21 17:42:12 @brooklyn120 Yeesh! Did you get the oil changed yet?
3286 2018-05-21 17:42:10 A friend of mine has to write an essay about 'Black Gold' in an exam, because he couldn't remember the word 'oil'.
3287 2018-05-21 17:42:08 Be a #badday if someone got an oil leak!! #DibsonTopBunk
3288 2018-05-21 17:41:54 Saudi's policy of only accepting Dollars for it's oil is what keeps the American standard of living propped up. Because of that, things like this will never be seriously opposed by the US Government. We will also never stop providing them weaponry.

3290 2018-05-21 17:41:44 One such example I can give is just a bowl of cooking oil. Anyone dumb enough to slip in won't be able to climb their way back out. @ w@
3291 2018-05-21 17:41:43 Want to bust Russia... END BIG OIL
When the price of oil started to crater in late 2014, Russia's economy and currency went down with it. US and European economic sanctions against Russia didn't help its economy either. DO IT AGAIN... SAVE DEMOCRACY
3292 2018-05-21 17:41:42 Hi Abigail, don't worry, it's sustainable palm oil! We're quite limited for text space on the packaging so it doesn't say this...but think we may need to consider changing that in the near future. Thanks!
3293 2018-05-21 17:41:40 Oil on canvas
3294 2018-05-21 17:41:22 I do need to get an oil change 
3295 2018-05-21 17:41:10 I got an oil change and a new tire today! Yay for being responsible.
3296 2018-05-21 17:40:58 (PS - Alleged intended use of the cooking oil? Likely story. 
Annnnd I may throw up now.)

I’m paying attention.
3298 2018-05-21 17:40:42 Iranians people elected a nationalist named Mohd Mosaddegh as their president & he kicked the British out of Iran & nationalised the oil business to share the wealth with the citizens of the country. This take the Western oil company a lot & they sent in their attack dog(CIA).

3304 2018-05-21 17:40:20 If cannabis oil can heal, remove pain, reverse symptoms, etcs., (and it IS doing so!), and does not make you "high" to any degree, why would you angrily stand against it and try to keep it illegal? I am dying to know!

3306 2018-05-21 17:40:14 That’s not just the south - both my local BP stations are £1.31

Yet when the oil price drops... 
3307 2018-05-21 17:40:05 Listen it’s enough that I’m wrecked between Sept and April being an Oil fan, no need to ruin my long weekend as well!
3308 2018-05-21 17:39:41 yes... in November 2017 it correlated even more and July 2017 was even more than November. In fact Sept and Oct 2017 were the only 2 months in all of 2017 where oil and dollar had an inverse correllation
3309 2018-05-21 17:39:08 In 20/20 hindsight, it was a huge mistake leaving Canada's petroleum reserves to the 'tender mercies' of the private sector. Corporations have pocketed most of the money from Canada's oil reserves, leaving Canadians with a pittance in royalties, and a massive clean up bill.
3310 2018-05-21 17:39:05 First he declares a trade war with China at a moment when he needs them for N. Korea.  he retreats.
then he conducts exercises and pisses them off.  he cancels exercises.
then he pulls out of Iran deal and oil skyrockets, crushing the American consumer. But,Putin & Oil gain big
3311 2018-05-21 17:39:05 About a year ago I heard we were the the number 1 oil 
Producer now or was about to be.
So wby is our gas prices just keep rising at a fast pace.
I know about Iran , but the only thing that should happen there is, Everyone else produces a little more.
3312 2018-05-21 17:39:04 Oil is far from Canada largest wealth maker. But it is the industry getting the largest tax handouts!
The oil lobbyists did their job, John, and conned gullible people like you.
3313 2018-05-21 17:39:03 WRONG!!!!! As usual.
3314 2018-05-21 17:38:54 My favorite thing about getting an oil change is the bonus opportunity to try fun and experimental new seat configurations.
3315 2018-05-21 17:38:50 The Trudeaus got rich off oil.  Suing countries who object to environmental degadation is so lucrative that hedge funds are getting in the act.  Trudeau facilitating the destruction of the planet Bill C-69

3317 2018-05-21 17:38:35 Mine will run on water. It’s free. Batteries and charging them are not. Same thing as oil.
3318 2018-05-21 17:38:34 I did just see a so called (expert) say if wti hits 80-85 a barrel it will start to negatively affect the economy. If I remember correctly the last time we had sky rocketing gas prices we had the great recession. I do agree with you Charles, I'm just worried about the oil prices.
3319 2018-05-21 17:38:30 Except Obama didn’t do specific things to raise the price of oil.  Taking Iran’s oil out of our markets by pulling our the Iran nuclear agreement certainly does that.
3320 2018-05-21 17:38:24 Because rising cost of oil lines Putie’s pockets
3321 2018-05-21 17:38:19 Truth is all political parties tax oil prices heavily as it is easy to collect & use it for giving freebies, loan waivers to fool people & loot it for their needs. Citizens wish is bring Oil prices immediately under GST. Don't fool telling it is centre or state subject
3322 2018-05-21 17:37:48 Is Avitu gone or could Oil still sogn him?
3323 2018-05-21 17:37:40 A while back, someone posted an image of a #BloodSouls art commission they did with paint on canvas and I lost the artist. Anyone know the artist I'm talking about? I think it was oil paints, but I'm not entirely certain.
3324 2018-05-21 17:37:28 E.D. had miltary guides and guards on the crossing. They know the paths well. Use them to assist smugglers who bring in mabhero, illicit whiskies, cheap Coke, Fanta, Cooking Oil etc. from Moza. It is a bush area (National Park) but really, well beaten and known paths. Fiction!
3325 2018-05-21 17:37:23 Let me give little history knowledge to you.
Back in the 50's the British had taken control of all of the oil of Iran. An oil company called "Anglo-Persian oil company" which today goes by the name British  petroleum or BP.
3326 2018-05-21 17:36:48 Hit oil facilities not airports!
3327 2018-05-21 17:36:38 to Iran as part of the deal,also since the ban on the oil deal were removed the government revenue increased which should have ameliorated the economical difficulties that people were facing, however non of these  funds were spend on the country.
3328 2018-05-21 17:36:38 Plz compare crude oil too...
3329 2018-05-21 17:36:32 they weren't demoted....they had to re apply

3332 2018-05-21 17:36:22 Note the power density of each source. Biomass<Coal/Oil/Gas<Nuclear. Hydro is site specific. Wind is 1.2 W/m2, solar 6.7 W/m2. One gas well = ~28W/m2. Nuclear =~56W/m2. Renewable should be used when it makes sense, but the density is an inherent problem

How the blue hell did George Bush and Obama waste all those trillions killing middle eastern civilians, when we had apparently militant gangs controlling our own streets?

Why did our presidents ignore this in favor of a foreign war for oil and opium?

3345 2018-05-21 17:35:37 The only problem is sir, in 2012 the crude oil price was higher than it is in 2018.
3346 2018-05-21 17:35:36 I don’t know everything, just apparently a vast amount more than you do on the topic of oil production.

3348 2018-05-21 17:35:16 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.

3352 2018-05-21 17:34:44 State police is the way to go. Buhari and his northern oligarchy dread to hear the word restructuring. They don’t want the oil $ to seize
3353 2018-05-21 17:34:37 No president has control of gas prices...except those who make pre-election deals for election-rigging help with oil rich countries.

when considering about battery manufacturing process and transportation of those batteries across seas on cargo ships which use "heavy fuel oil" to the europe, well that's enough emission!
3364 2018-05-21 17:33:46 As a candidate for Congress, I have signed the #NoFossilFuel pledge. I have been vocal about this for years.

3365 2018-05-21 17:33:38 Sir what are the measures you are going to take to refuce oil price and to give some reliefs to poor and middle class.. We are waiting to hear from you.. Your oil minister is in different. Kindly do not take test of our patience.
3366 2018-05-21 17:33:32 getting the first oil change on my car y’all  my baby is growing up
3367 2018-05-21 17:33:31 What irresponsible statements - one should first understand how the finances of a Govt work - accounts are subject to CAG scrutiny - prices of veg are market determined - unfortunately we have no control over crude prices as we are not an oil producing nation
3368 2018-05-21 17:33:25 Modiji' we don't mind for you increase the petrol according to crude oil price but do us a favour also increase salary everyday according to the same crude oil sirji....then we will not complain...
3369 2018-05-21 17:33:25 They controlled the prices then, it's open to market now, needless to say, they used it for political gains tactfully. Oil cos bled. Plus, that period was coupled with high inflation too, 10+%inflation. So context was different too
3370 2018-05-21 17:33:14 No problems with oil being shipped to the east coast then?
3371 2018-05-21 17:33:03 Yeah but we all know it was about oil
3372 2018-05-21 17:33:03 انطم يامتخلف
3373 2018-05-21 17:32:59 Ah, I also misread that Trump wanted to abort her I guess? It's more of a whataboutism, but I'll play. People change, she obviously wasn't aborted. She's now 20 something I guess...his views can change. I mean Hillary was against gay marriage before she was for it.
3374 2018-05-21 17:32:55 Oil...the petroleum God.
3375 2018-05-21 17:32:51 And to think. Before the oil money you probs supported Man U, Chelsea and Barca.
3376 2018-05-21 17:32:49 There chances at finessing Carolina for Justin Faulk are high. I don't know why everyone thinks the oil need a massive overhaul. Any big move centers around Nuge and I'm just not willing to move him. Period.
3377 2018-05-21 17:32:47 You’re right - Canada and the USA have very different cultures - they have gun culture and we don’t.
3378 2018-05-21 17:32:46 Like how Tesla is at war against the automobile industry and the oil and gas industry
3379 2018-05-21 17:32:38 U.S is not Australia. Most rational ppl know if you banned ALL guns the crime rates would explode here.

3387 2018-05-21 17:31:58 Why does NDOR put oil and gravel on the highways when we’re going into the summer months? Maybe NFOR should start paying for chipped and cracked windshields
3388 2018-05-21 17:31:57 Also, Ford is not going to be able to sell boodles of natural gas for $13/Gj, and oil at $100/bbl as Klein could. That saved Klein, otherwise he'd have just been as another mean, nasty little man which essentially what Ford is.....

3392 2018-05-21 17:31:30 I would imagine copious amounts of CBD oil should substantially increase the hours of sleep?
3393 2018-05-21 17:31:24 I used my first essential oil blend today. It’s a calming one but it smells like pine needles which is the worst smell in the world so I am not calm.

3400 2018-05-21 17:30:07 Gas prices over $3 per gallon, Home heating oil up, stock market down, food prices up - huge breaks for corporations, including big oil, but the measly $10 increase that I saw in my pay has been eaten away by rising prices.  And our deficit is exploding!  Wake the F up!
3401 2018-05-21 17:29:57 Vale I have a very serious question : do you put salt in cooking water for pasta? Oil? We’re having a debate here (I’ve been in Sicily for the past 12 days ... )
3402 2018-05-21 17:29:56 In just 2 months, the Petro Yuan has taken 12% of oil contracts. So called economic ''experts'', are saying that it will take 30 years, for the Reserve currency, the US Dollar, to seriously be affected. More like 5 years.
3403 2018-05-21 17:29:52 Hey everyone in the Lubbock or surrounding area. Looking to have an informational meeting about CBD oil around the last of June. Sure hope you can join us.#itsallabouttheoil, #medicaljane, #healthynothigh

3405 2018-05-21 17:29:42 There is no point. It was a troll tweet straw man.
3406 2018-05-21 17:29:38 A thousand is very few on ocean scales, they don't pollute, and the more data we have about oceans, the better. As long as they don't actually get used for oil exploration I think these sound great.
3407 2018-05-21 17:29:35 I don’t know shit about cars. Dude kept asking me hella questions & I’m just like look... I just need a tire rotation & an oil change, all I know is that my car take synthetic oil 
3408 2018-05-21 17:29:33 My question is, WTF was the cooking oil for? LOL
3409 2018-05-21 17:29:26 ...after all they do have TONS of oil......
3410 2018-05-21 17:29:24 Omg thank you  it’s all thanks to DevaCurl and argan oil
3411 2018-05-21 17:29:19 Also he has a 100% chance of being right. If oil is below $120 he said low probability but if it’s above he called it and has the CNBC screenshot.
3412 2018-05-21 17:29:16 I've got one thing to say: olive oil
3413 2018-05-21 17:29:14 Well there is the Minecraft/alt right/Nazi recruitment issue so it’s not exactly unpredictable. 

Peterson seems to just be a fairly typical snake oil salesmen doing the same thing that cleans up this nonsense for the mainstream for secular folk. It’s like Robert Bly.
3414 2018-05-21 17:29:06 Resp sister,  Kindly check the international crude oil price also compare the rate of intl crude oil with respect to natnl price 
According past govt is responsible eg npa!!
3415 2018-05-21 17:28:58 Women need red meat.  They have become chicken eaters.....which is nothing more than seed oil with feathers.   Way to much omega-6
3416 2018-05-21 17:28:52 I stock 7 different strengths of CBD oil from 250mg up to 4000mg.
3417 2018-05-21 17:28:49 I’m waiting for the day that my mom goes and gets her oil changed and comes back with a new car 
3418 2018-05-21 17:28:49 Someone come oil my back and bum for me
3419 2018-05-21 17:28:43 I would remind you that Scotland gives Westminster far more money than it gets back, always has done, even before oil.
3420 2018-05-21 17:28:38 Clove oil. Tastes like crap but really works!
3421 2018-05-21 17:28:33 Where is the hypocrisy? Go ask her, if she had an abortion, she's part of the problem and I take the same issue with her as I do others. So I guess what I'm getting at is, what's your point exactly?
3422 2018-05-21 17:28:29 Doesn't work. Salt degrades the frying oil at a vastly faster rate. The numbers have already been run ;x
3423 2018-05-21 17:28:26 I will never feel safe alone with an officer, and even more unsafe with two? I’ve witnessed how horrible they can be all because they have this badge that gives them authority over others? Protecting big oil is one case that is all too familiar!
3424 2018-05-21 17:28:11 Sorry! LOL
3425 2018-05-21 17:28:03 All cultures are not equal. Comparing this country to that one. Many countries with low gun ownership have high homicide rates anyway.

3435 2018-05-21 17:27:05 Well when oil goes up it goes up too.  Still California is a high gas tax state.  Most liberal states are.

3461 2018-05-21 17:25:07 I’m wondering how you legislate people into being “sensible” when the government can’t even be sensible.

We should vote on it 

While we’re at it we should make people “responsible”, you know because it’s responsible when someone else has to tell you to do it.

friend comes from his earnest counsel” (Proverbs 27:5-6, 9).
3508 2018-05-21 17:20:27 Norway found oil..got the politicians out the way and let the actual intelligent thoughtful folk decide how to manage it..
3509 2018-05-21 17:20:19 Even if it's just something small, you can help out in a big way to save the environment. You could use other types of oils instead of palm oil to save Sumatran rainforest or carpool, bike, walkto work/school to lessen carbon emissions and save coral reefs

Thanks Perry.  Brian from Oil City, PA
3511 2018-05-21 17:20:16 Are u on idiot? Can you compare global oil price with ours? 

Don't you know that India imports 80% of its oil from global markets?
3512 2018-05-21 17:20:14 look at u with ya oil iphone notifications
3513 2018-05-21 17:20:10 Only in the oil field you would find a cranberry walnut salad in the porta John. Takes a brave soul to accomplish that
3514 2018-05-21 17:20:06 But a lot of oil. Thatz soo important
3515 2018-05-21 17:19:57 Crude oil is giving crude shocks too

2) Triple talaq bill pass
3) pending bills 
4) Arrest all corrupted like mallya, nirav 
5) reduce crude oil price irrespective of world politics as our citizens are not that aware 
6) make unbiased social media
7) teach Pakistan lesson via fatf
3520 2018-05-21 17:19:30 ダメです。
3521 2018-05-21 17:19:23 It’s a demand issue: Unless you stop have children, driving ICE cars, flying by air & follow a plant based diet, oil demand keeps growing. Would you like to see the peer reviewed research? Have you personally done the above?  If not, you’re also a hypocrite.
3522 2018-05-21 17:19:20 Irrelevant to the conversation.
3523 2018-05-21 17:19:15 オイル、君なら地球を救える。
3524 2018-05-21 17:19:13 Thanks Graeme, it would be ideal if it were listed on packaging as straight palm oil, or a derivative, so we can make an informed choice. We won’t be able to buy any more products unless we’re sure it’s sustainable.
3525 2018-05-21 17:19:08 lmao bitch you don’t even use beard oil. 
3526 2018-05-21 17:19:04 Ramai cakap new formulation mcm tak ngam dgn kulit. Yg old formulation tak sempat try. Nasib baik ada back up cleansing oil. Beli yg HL pun sbb nk tahu difference between non mineral oil dgn mineral oil based cleansing oil. Nmpk gaya kulit takleh terima.
3527 2018-05-21 17:19:00 I hate going to dealerships to get oil changes. I need a garage.
3528 2018-05-21 17:18:36 A customer smashed kids fish oil at work, didnt tell us then carried it across the store n put it on the shelf. There was literally oil all over the floor, walls and products. And someone else got conditioner everywhere. I smell like a mixture of lemons and salmon. Might cry xxxx
3529 2018-05-21 17:18:28 They blamed him for EVERYTHING! From price of oil to climate change(another liberal ruse)
3530 2018-05-21 17:18:07 2012-13 under Manmohan rule when the crude oil was $150/barrel, petrol prices was ₹70/litre

In June 2016 under Modi rule when the crude prices was $33/barrel, petrol prices were ₹60/litre
Now Crude oil price is $80/barrel, petrol price is ₹ 84/litre

Looto India looto
3531 2018-05-21 17:17:52 マルラオイルって聞いたことある！でもまだ使ったことないです。色んなのがあって目移りするし、全部試す事も出来ないし困る〜！今気になってるのはprickly pare oilですが、高価なんですよね。アルガンよりアンチエイジング効果があるみたいです。ブレンドものを使ったらなかなか良かったです。

3533 2018-05-21 17:17:28 Probably useless to tell them that plastics come from the BYPRODUCTS of petroleum and not from the raw oil.

3539 2018-05-21 17:16:50 Sir, you have not answered the question being raised on abnormal hike of petrol/ diesel prices amidst of low crude oil prices . Rather, your comments resembles Bhakth's mentality. Hope, you answer the question.
3540 2018-05-21 17:16:46 "helps all those common afflictions from arthritis to depression"

Standard test for snake oil is the number of ailments it is supposed to treat. The more ailments the more likely it is to be bogus.
3541 2018-05-21 17:16:28 It's obvious what the US is doing now, they're pushing Iran further and further into a corner which would result in a war that would end with Israel and the US controlling the Middle East together with the oil sheiks.
3542 2018-05-21 17:16:05 Two of ours are grtting up there in mileage too. This one has 193k miles (engine rebuilt about 40k miles ago after original seized up, they burn oil)

3556 2018-05-21 17:14:47 Why to expect blessings from Brahma Vishnu and Mahesh when you guys don’t have the sense to formulate right policies for oil exploration in India? You expect BVM to come and take out oil for you? How can India have so many Kohinoors in one party??? Learn something from US !
3557 2018-05-21 17:14:46 Judging by that last shit my diet is 100% olive oil.
3558 2018-05-21 17:14:38 Just finished the two hour debate, I feel like you understand want you mean, the issue to me was one guy went in a snake oil salesman tactic, the other looking for meaningful debate who cottoned on too late.
3559 2018-05-21 17:14:31 You guys are proving my point that "He who shouts louder is the winner" in Indian politics. But hopefully things will change one day. I hope that the four years of looting of people by oil companies finally makes them think differently.
3560 2018-05-21 17:14:30 The usability of @InfoChip spans many industries, including oil & gas and mining, allowing asset tracking anywhere.
3561 2018-05-21 17:14:12 Destroying forest in the name of developments can not be justified at all even if we require palm oil for sustaining life then we should see other options that make the balance of our ecosystem. I believe forests are the resources that will provide revenue for country.
3562 2018-05-21 17:14:11 Fantastic work Piper! What pledges do @LEGO_Group have to be part of the @circulareconomy, to use #recycled plastics & not new oil &gas. The planet needs YOU Piper! 
3563 2018-05-21 17:14:07 You don’t understand the economics. Capital simply leaves Canada b/c we block development. Capital is invested elsewhere and oil is still produced at a worse environmental footprint. The greens may think they have won, but Mother Nature loses. Sheer stupidity.
3564 2018-05-21 17:13:49 Lucky you! If I were to by vaseline, I'd drip oil 
3565 2018-05-21 17:13:46 that feeling when you take 600mg of ibuprofen and 3 droppers of cbd oil and are still having the most debilitating cramps that you can’t look your customers in the eye
3566 2018-05-21 17:13:46 Its nice for a moment but hai  I'm not a fan of the oil
3567 2018-05-21 17:13:42 "Investors"  must have decided that higher oil prices and rising inflation is a good thing. DOW up another 300+ points, now tops 25,000.
3568 2018-05-21 17:13:41 Kalau cleansing oil formula baru tu idk la, banyak sangat extra oil HL tambah. Kalau formula lama, probably olive oil.
Same case like me la, tak ok dengan olive oil 
3569 2018-05-21 17:13:30 And i have so much leftover red oil and im already hungry just thinking about what ill cook tomorrow huhu
3570 2018-05-21 17:13:17 No problem! 

Also, if you have trouble relaxing at times, get lavender essential oil. Also lavender scented candles. It's supposed to calm one down. Just breathing it in helps calm one too :)
3571 2018-05-21 17:13:15 Like why did homegirl just buy a lv purse but she doesn’t have a car? And why did homeboy buy a bmw but can’t even afford the oil changes.. y’all need to think differently
3572 2018-05-21 17:13:14 Using kayaks & manufactured goods from oil is not the same as setting the non-renewable on fire for fuel. Would you burn your family photo albums for fuel? Why torch other irreplaceable things? You use solar everyday to light up your life. Let’s use each resource best.

3576 2018-05-21 17:12:54 Can you Just file a RTI ask from the govt of India What's the import price of oil from Saudi Arabia? A big story will come to public
3577 2018-05-21 17:12:47 Eric and Xander should settle their differences shirtless, in a small pool of oil #days
3578 2018-05-21 17:12:31 And on that note...Bob, once again, shows us that he has nothing of value to add to this conversation. I mean, we all knew he didn't, but it's little gems like this that remind us that he had nothing.
3579 2018-05-21 17:12:31 Do not teach me about Israel. If Islam is the religion of peace then why does every country have Muslim in terrorist incidents? Look at most of the Muslim countries who are killing each other. Well you guys have no inventions on the day when your oil well is over you have nothing

3595 2018-05-21 17:11:27 Tweeting a few simple graphs on India's crude, LPG imports and consumption of total oil products, petrol (MS), diesel (HSD), and LPG
3596 2018-05-21 17:11:25 In my opinion that is not at all true.. 15W-40 is 15W-40. If the oil specs on the drum match the oil specs for the engine then it’s compatible. If anything you should be burning less with synthetic due to its better viscous stability at temp.
3597 2018-05-21 17:11:24 I'd imagine the "other bits" to be food and drink, oil, farming, fishing...y'know, trifles.

3604 2018-05-21 17:10:55 Well they gutted The Navigation Protection Act destroying Canada's protection of navigable waterways in one fell swoop all hidden inside the budget. (C-45) 2012

It left only 97 lakes and 62 rivers of the thousands of such waterways in Canada protected. All in the aid of Big oil.

3606 2018-05-21 17:10:42 Yep! It tastes very similar to PB! I discovered it when I was looking for alternatives after figuring out I’m allergic to peanuts and tree nuts. But if you’re looking for a butter alternative, I think there are some veggie oil spreads that could probably suffice

3622 2018-05-21 17:08:51 "Be careful what you wish for" was my warning last year, related to Macro getting too hot, bringing unwanted inflation. I keyed on commodities. Loved Energy bc of this thesis. Risk is prices break out too far - see Lumber. Wouldn't fade any price spike right now, incl Oil.

3634 2018-05-21 17:07:39 Yes but oil bought from another country doesn't help Iran. Iran's oil can be worth $1tril. If it's not sold Iran gets Zilch.  Also as oil prices rise US fracking will again become profitable and actually boost our economy, until prices stabilize again. we've seen it before.

3638 2018-05-21 17:07:28 India is not much blessed when it comes to oil, with import dependence at 83 % and rising. Hence, Issues such as petrol and diesel prices should not be politicised. All parties need to do whatever they can in states where they are in power to help extend relief to the consumer.
3639 2018-05-21 17:07:24 Moisturise an hour before, exfoliate the softened skin away as much as possible, use baby oil instead of shaving foam and use a light touch so you're not gouging your legs,  works for me  if you can afford it, consider laser hair removal when your skin is clear, its ace!

3642 2018-05-21 17:07:05 Oil price changes account for 88% of the annual variation in CPI growth which in turn drives the performance of TIPS that use the CPI for principal adjustment. Therefore, breakevens track oil and so do treasuries.
3643 2018-05-21 17:06:54 I started Twitter following a few artists and maybe an occasional cosplay account

Now my timeline is all weird moe porn art and women rubbing oil on themselves and I can't open this site in public anymore
3644 2018-05-21 17:06:49 Oh okay. What carrier oil? Something like vitamin e oil? I also have neem oil
3645 2018-05-21 17:06:42 I’m producing a film for Alfa Laval about how to install a scrubber on a oil tanker down in Hiroshima. Very interesting project on a very important environment subject.
3646 2018-05-21 17:06:36 The +div LL setup on inverse crude ETFs look delicious. Will oil bulls be able to break these YTD long +div across TFs or are we approaching a topping area?

3647 2018-05-21 17:06:23 Yep, the squeaking wheel gets the oil.
3648 2018-05-21 17:06:17 There is such an organization. It's called the Democratic Party.
3649 2018-05-21 17:06:14 Nope. Should be diluted with a carrier oil. Can’t be put directly on the skin.

3656 2018-05-21 17:05:12 They brought religion to steal our gold, oil, limestone steel, diamond and so on. 

They were like vultures scavenging for what they could lay their hands on.

Their secret mission was "Convert or die, or convert then die. Make your choice."

3661 2018-05-21 17:04:47 Their objective is clear, they are going after oil rich countries.
3662 2018-05-21 17:04:16 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
3663 2018-05-21 17:04:11 I took a shower before coming to get my oil changed. I go to give the guy my keys and he looks at me and says “Wow. You smell really good.” Clearly they don’t get many women in here 
3664 2018-05-21 17:04:09 today I’m extra thankful for my granddaddy. the white people that changed my oil we’re trying to get me out of $500 for things he did for free 
3665 2018-05-21 17:04:09 Okay. Is tea tree oil better
3666 2018-05-21 17:04:01 Apparently there’s a garlic oil based spray that works well, but it’s only a temporary thing, lasts a few hours. Use it on the lawn. It’s recommended for backyard bbq’s etc. I think Holes carries it.

3668 2018-05-21 17:03:54 Yeah I do one every two weeks cause I put too much oil in there and it usually still be in there  so I just wait til I wash my hair again
3669 2018-05-21 17:03:47 Your language shows how much educated you are. At least he has a degree to show instead of giving fake affidavits of education while filing nominations for polls like our PM did. Stability oh yeah $rate is at ₹68, Oil prices reaching 84/l, Farming & Employment growth down etcetc
3670 2018-05-21 17:03:40 u want US democracy like in #iraq #afghanistan and #libya? They just want your oil
3671 2018-05-21 17:03:35 Oil is high, rupee is low, small-mid caps are falling. This is the time to gradually accumulate excellent businesses - not when everything is hunky dory. Oil won't stay that high, and the rupee will continue to gradually appreciate in real terms. You need patience, staying power.
3672 2018-05-21 17:03:00 So we are still super oil dependent....and the efforts to diversify appear not to produce expected results ...Nice analysis Tosin.
3673 2018-05-21 17:02:45 Hemp seed oil is completely different.  Cannabidiol is found in MJ and Hemp.  The difference is that MJ had THC (not legal in all states) and Hemp has trace ammounts (legal in all states).  Also Hemp is richer in CBD and easier to grow FTW
3674 2018-05-21 17:02:42 @TeamCavuto MayB air $go up bec of need 4 diesel.Xplain reason every yr as warmer weather approaches the oil industry Xcuse 4 higher gas$ is need 4lightsweet crude.Fracking has makes it available according 2 Jeff B. so Y is regular gas higher
3675 2018-05-21 17:02:35 Um, can only speak for CA but gas prices rise here EVERY Spring, usually about April. Research reveals a phony new Big Oil rationale every year, just business as usual. Kill Big Oil 
3676 2018-05-21 17:02:33 Oil firms have struggled with subdued prices in recent years. At the same time, France and the U.K. have announced plans to end petrol and diesel cars by 2040. However, Van Beurden is not worried with these changes.
3677 2018-05-21 17:02:20 The International Energy Agency doesn't see oil peaking until after 2040, even assuming nations around the world achieve announced "aims, targets and intentions" to limit carbon emissions and generate more of their energy from renewable sources.
3678 2018-05-21 17:02:18 The biggest loss is due to unemployment if this earned money had been invested in employment generation ,,,the oil prices hike could be bearable.. Thanks
3679 2018-05-21 17:02:16 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.

-apply Vaseline or castor oil to your brows and lashes to help them grow

-mix moisturizer with your foundation for a more natural look

-drink hot water with half a lemon in it
3690 2018-05-21 17:01:23 3T almond flour, 1/2 t baking powder, 1 egg, 1T oil, salt to taste - mix all in a ramekin dish and microwave for 90 sec. Then you can toast it too.

3692 2018-05-21 17:01:19 Demand for oil could peak by the late 2020s or early 2030s if technology and policy develop quickly, Royal Dutch Shell CEO Ben van Beurden said.
That is a more aggressive outlook than other best-case scenarios developed by BP and IEA.
Van Beurden said he supports the development,
3693 2018-05-21 17:01:13 What's stopping better security, identifying the cause? So far laws have not stopped them and proposed laws would have impacted very few
3694 2018-05-21 17:01:08 Try castor oil, hair oil, but government benefits.
3695 2018-05-21 17:01:07 Last time he dug oil he sank Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation.
3696 2018-05-21 17:00:59 Yeah, that's the "carving up the oil pie" model, though I remember thinking "Wait a sec, that oil may be in Alaska, but it's also in the United States. Where's *my* cut?!" 
3697 2018-05-21 17:00:49 I am a living sacrifice... slaughtered everyday. Paying the price for this oil. You can't have what I have, cuz I'm paying for it.

3709 2018-05-21 16:59:32 they want your oil and didn't care about the iranians
3710 2018-05-21 16:59:30 The problem was always going to be that Trump, in his grandiosity, believes his personal interests can be harmonized with national interests. So he wants to maintain access to Russian oligarch and Arab oil money for his businesses. Work backward from there.
3711 2018-05-21 16:59:28 @ThePreciousMama Yeesh! Have you taken care of the oil change?
3712 2018-05-21 16:59:20 Wakeup frm political hangover and bless d country wid a survy on how much ppl r happy wid rising oil prices..dere is.. life beyond politics...

3715 2018-05-21 16:59:05 Yeah. I think our biggest weapon is inflation. Oil price is rising like anything now which will increase inflation. Need to use it properly till 2019.
3716 2018-05-21 16:58:54 CBD oil and kratom! 
3717 2018-05-21 16:58:52 It's funny how oil and gas companies market themselves as leaders in researching innovative solutions to emission problems instead pivoting to renewable energy companies. Here's a solution. Stop burning fossil fuels you fucking weiners.@BP_plc @Shell #oilandgas #renewable #energy
3718 2018-05-21 16:58:45 Up date. Little Bird man came for an oil change with me!
3719 2018-05-21 16:58:43 There are oil companies that have no connection to mid east oil. Investigate to find them.
3720 2018-05-21 16:58:38 Expected. Low level vulgarities are part for this troll when he loses beyond repair.
3721 2018-05-21 16:58:05 So you prove again that you have no substance, with lack of any data and resultant vulgarity. You really are bad at trolling. Bless your heart. Why does my trouncing you trigger you more than the others? It's really quite pathetic.
3722 2018-05-21 16:57:51 Oil is NOT the reason Dubai flourishes. They understand trade. Trade and tourism.
3723 2018-05-21 16:57:50 This is coming from a place where I always felt like I had to say yes
I had to say yes, or things weren't okay
or I wasn't safe

but now, from all that past
all that history
the most profound thing I've ever learned to say
is No.
with a capitol N and a hard period

No.

3728 2018-05-21 16:57:30 This is great to know! My daughter uses Oil of Oregano on her breakouts and loves the results. Oil of oregano is good for so many things...
3729 2018-05-21 16:57:26 The poorest people are suffering hunger right now, babies of the poor die in hospitals for lack of medicine. World record inflation despite huge oil resources, crime rate second worst in the world, in the top ten of worst corruption countries. The Chavez myth has long vanished!
3730 2018-05-21 16:57:20 To some extent we will never know whether he's deluded or malicious. However it is also unimportant. You are still a snake oil salesperson whether you believe in the snake oil or not!
3731 2018-05-21 16:57:17 Those hearings basically give a great insight into current identity politics, and its effects in the wider world. Its not old wine, or snake oil. It’s really v. Relevant. Everyone should see them.
3732 2018-05-21 16:57:14 40% of US oil consumed is US oil and 43% of imported oil comes from Canada(our best trade partner since there's volume and balance). High prices may have a net positive on US GDP. Looks like the gas profits are going back into our economy.

3737 2018-05-21 16:56:58 So why was there a revolution? 
Reality a small group took the oil money and lived well the rest struggled. Just like most oil states.
3738 2018-05-21 16:56:54 Sanctuary provice, oil ban, etc etc. N D P are a disaster.
3739 2018-05-21 16:56:54 You know, oil changes would be so much faster if the mechanic would just shut the f*** up. 
Yes, hello, I can see you you lazy sh**.
3740 2018-05-21 16:56:51 Loo oil o» mm ml ml mliok
3741 2018-05-21 16:56:25 And the flow/ ss answer makes far more sense - Trump breaks Iran deal, Pompeo in the news w new draconian restrictions... And the market anticipates *some* disruption in oil supply. While UTN is moving based on other factors. Maybe more inflation, and higher yields still yet
3742 2018-05-21 16:56:24 I have to say my favourite passage in the communist manifesto is the one where Marx recommends building an economy entirely dependent upon oil reserves and grossly mismanaging your exchange rates
3743 2018-05-21 16:56:11 $OIL looks toppy here ... we may get some selling soon

3761 2018-05-21 16:54:32 This is the entire game for Trump. Do what he’s told, get oil back up, Syria to Russia and they’ll wipe his debt clean. He is compromised and there’s very little the public can do. We have to rely on our institutions to save us from all this winning. #MAGA
3762 2018-05-21 16:54:24 Is that drilling of some sorts? Oil? Don’t see those at all in the Southwest. Lol
3763 2018-05-21 16:54:18 I think that Trump has been drooling over Iran's oil, and he has a scheme with Russia and other countries to control it all, and leave us with a few chunks of coal.

3775 2018-05-21 16:53:09 except the small fact that this really isn't a fact since the US has strangled the Russian Oil based economy since Trump and China just let in our products in historic fashion.  Kinda funny in that regard.  Kudos #MAGA

3778 2018-05-21 16:53:01 What about using CBD oil instead? I have a friend that has wicked arthritis and she uses it on her hands and knees and says it helps a ton.
3779 2018-05-21 16:53:00 What kind of oil!!!
3780 2018-05-21 16:52:59 I drowned my tree collards and sugarcane in neem oil. I noticed a lot of them died when I checked yesterday.
3781 2018-05-21 16:52:58 If the Canadian dollar and oil prices hadn’t declined they could have won 10 straight but the cap didn’t go up enough
3782 2018-05-21 16:52:57 Lovely oil beetle pics. Yes we only have records of Black oil beetle from Scilly, but always worth checking. Also the oil beetle season on Scilly is later than the mainland for some reason #MondayFunFact

3784 2018-05-21 16:52:49 I'm reading this text at the exact moment that I'm pulling my (all natural 100% peanuts) upside down peanut butter out of the fridge. No oil. No mess. Life hack.
3785 2018-05-21 16:52:42 What policies have Trump and complicit repubLIEcons created to give corporations an excuse to raise the price of oil which in turn raises the price of gas or is this President Obama’s fault too? JustAsking
3786 2018-05-21 16:52:27 Sure but what happened with the great fish oil spill of 2018?

3792 2018-05-21 16:52:01 I know that.  Cruise oil was 100 dollar now it is 80.  That's big difference. Also it was 60 during 2016 still no decease in price.

3800 2018-05-21 16:50:47 But Canada will buy your oil
3801 2018-05-21 16:50:44 Have a lovely day.
3802 2018-05-21 16:50:24 They pay the oil producers to keep producing and keep the price down.
3803 2018-05-21 16:50:22 I'm going to have to see some evidence that you export more oil than you import. 
In the end, that's what determines if you can be called one or the other. 
Importing nations are also much more bound by OPEC prices, so that will definately determine your future prices
3804 2018-05-21 16:50:13 Yes ma’am. I found out a year and half ago, but now the youtuber BriHallOfficial made a whole video on it too like two days ago. Im at the end of my small Black castor oil Eco Styler and im done after that.

3813 2018-05-21 16:49:26 Perhaps this is a lesson to the Oil fans and organization that you should roll with youth & talent and steer clear of the “Grit” ppl are so obsessed with...

3818 2018-05-21 16:48:43 Small oil leak in the gasket of the oil filter. Guy said I was smart to pull over and check oil first.
3819 2018-05-21 16:48:21 Stupidity at her best. Compare fuel price with crude oil price, then only u can understand this tweet.
3820 2018-05-21 16:48:16 Hi, Ben. Our QA team has confirmed that the Vegan Cheese product does not contain Soy.
However, we do use a soy based oil to grease our pizza pans and therefore there may be traces of soy due to this.
3821 2018-05-21 16:48:10 Just be carefull with the oliveoil.. you don´t want this recipe to have much wet ingridients,  because that´s the only risk this recipe can get disgusting. Just use enough oil to make da ingridients merge easier in da blender. 
The bread should not get all soggy in your hand.

3826 2018-05-21 16:47:52 He never wanted anyone in coal country to hear that because he can't get oil money if people think coal isn't going to stay. He had to lie to everyone or he doesn't get paid. If these Hillbillies would just think for a moment they would know their jobs are leaving regardless!
3827 2018-05-21 16:47:36 Less CCs tbh.
Idk but after bottles of cleansing oils it seems like my skin mmg tak berapa ngam dgn most common oils used in oil cleanser (olive, grapeseed, castor, etc.). Mineral lagi langsung zzzz.

3835 2018-05-21 16:47:16 I gotta change my oil today
3836 2018-05-21 16:47:09 OPEC had lowered prices to put Russian oil, which is highly expensive to produce, out of circulation it had same effect to the Canadian oil sands. High prices only benefits Putin.
3837 2018-05-21 16:47:03 Where is babachir, maina and our 25b oil money?
3838 2018-05-21 16:47:01 Aur is base price main bhi (37 & 40 main) import duties on crude oil & excise duties on finished oil included hain.
3839 2018-05-21 16:46:43 I think I learned yesterday that my indifference toward truffle oil has evolved into actual distaste. Or maybe I just used bad truffle oil.
3840 2018-05-21 16:46:39 Except, the USA doesn’t get any oil from Iran and a robust economy, that the Democrats couldn’t give us, will uses more oil.

3843 2018-05-21 16:46:30 Too easy. Witchita Oil. Big bomb.
3844 2018-05-21 16:46:25 I just came here for a oil change . Now I’m replacing brake lights & filters 
3845 2018-05-21 16:46:19 I once set a fresh oil painting atop a fridge, to cure, out of harm's way. Weeks later, I retrieved it, only to discover our kitten's paw prints pressed into it, ossified like dinosaur prints, all across it--and immortalized all around the top of the fridge, for good measure.
3846 2018-05-21 16:46:12 Only now it's about promised oil hijacking and war by The DumbDonald Cartel.
3847 2018-05-21 16:46:06 They're great guys, but that's practically required there.  The Queen was changing oil during WW2.
3848 2018-05-21 16:46:06 Some of the most ignorant statements spewing from #AB mouths are thinking that people opposed to #KM are opposed to oil&gas. On the contrary. We want responsible, environmentally sound harvesting with an emphasis on moving toward green technology. #bcpoli #cdnpoli #abpoli
3849 2018-05-21 16:46:03 Place sanctions on Venezuelan Oil!
3850 2018-05-21 16:45:59 @MoltonBrownUK how many of your products use palm oil, if so is it sustainably sourced?
3851 2018-05-21 16:45:57 This is Trump’s America which will hurt the coal miners, people in the oil industry or those who work at minimum wage aka his voters. But they will still happy with Trump.
3852 2018-05-21 16:45:55 Mike Pence wouldn’t know democracy if it but him in the ass! He is leading the charge to privatize and steal Venezuela oil. Why isn’t THAT the story?  Ask Tillerson, he started the takeover.

3854 2018-05-21 16:45:48 Probably yes, but Global resources are at constant threat even now, fracking, oil spills. So we may not be able to reverse the damage of climate but we can still fight to have clean drinking water.
3855 2018-05-21 16:45:43 Hi William, I'm so sorry your oil was out of date. I can understand your frustration. Can you please DM me your full name, address, email, barcode and also a clear copy of your receipt? 1/2
3856 2018-05-21 16:45:26 Yeah because it's harder to deal with than oil and grease.  :-)
3857 2018-05-21 16:45:20 I suppose corporations are people for citizens united but not for fraud
3858 2018-05-21 16:45:18 He’s too far invested to admit he was taken in by a snake oil salesman. So he takes to arguing with former FBI honchos about FBI machinations.  All for a fear of admitting he was wrong.
3859 2018-05-21 16:45:16 Story within story is reason why ALL 3 of them.  Seems staged to allow firing of McLellan if Oil don't get off to good start.

3863 2018-05-21 16:45:00 European countries are not going along with this. They will still buy their oil and gas. Failed policy by Trump. Doesn’t know how to lead. Won’t accept diplomatic methods. Uses a “big stick”, like the past.

3879 2018-05-21 16:43:44 Cebu has oil... US will come anytime now
3880 2018-05-21 16:43:43 It's combination of small size, underdeveloped service economy and huge cash inflow from oil sales pretty much mean it has no need.

Imagine the reaction to the City of London being subject to a Foreign Exchange Transfer Tax given that we would no longer be in a position to veto?
3881 2018-05-21 16:43:41 Yes. It works and is a clean rinse so no residue is left behind. It also is great for birds caught in oil spills. It cuts the grease.
3882 2018-05-21 16:43:33 Left unsaid was a deeper reason for the divestiture. Months of deliberations behind closed doors at Shell headquarters in The Hague, Netherlands, had led the top brass at the world’s largest non-state-owned oil company by sales to conclude that the energy industry was changing

Oh yeah- wasn't too long ago at all! Iraq, Libya, Syria
3890 2018-05-21 16:42:57 2NDimpact on Scotland’s economy, the high level of ownership amongst oil and gas operators means that many of the profits FLOW OUT of Scotland. Who organised the licenses for these operators ? This contrasts with Norway.

3895 2018-05-21 16:42:44 Last March, Royal Dutch Shell said it was selling most of its stake in Canada’s oil sands, a vast project that has extracted millions of barrels of sticky, gooey hydrocarbons from the ground in a process that resembles mining more than drilling.

3918 2018-05-21 16:40:46 @StephenMillerAL There's pain at he pump which may soon turn into a recession that the Prez seems oblivious about. He can change that by removing regulations on  natural gas so it be used for transportation.His whole agenda will halt if there's a recession due to high oil prices.

3926 2018-05-21 16:39:57 Iran was democratic nation back in 50's and then US deployed brutal Shah monarch so that US could theft oil from Iran like they did in rest of the Arab world.
3927 2018-05-21 16:39:53 There's a big difference between what they think of us - the people and culture of America - and what they think of our government. No one has cared much for the American government since the 50s, but they almost all love American culture, which transcends government.

I’ve ridden over 15,000km on my 8kg racing bike and only needed to give it a drop of oil on chain. What’s the best value for travelling? #bikeit #dumpthecar #cycleinthecity

3947 2018-05-21 16:37:36 Is that going to make the prices go up like what happened with oil. When the oil companies started drilling oil here at home again the price of gas went down.  Now that they aware selling the oil on overseas markets the price is going way up. Unfair to the American Consumer.
3948 2018-05-21 16:37:27 And with all that intelligence and wealth they still drive there car with the oil light on!

4012 2018-05-21 16:31:09 The EU's minimum limit is 800 not 3200, and UK customs can ask if you have more. The answer for the fuel oil question is surely to start harmonising excise duty although I wonder how that would go down.

4049 2018-05-21 16:27:32 So there’s the problem you can buy 3200 cigarettes as long as they are for personal use but you can’t buy 500ls of oil even though it’s for your home and personal consumption
4050 2018-05-21 16:27:31 So for the very first time I m going to try onion water on my hair, let see how does this turn out on this scalp... Pure onion water, nothing added, if it works out then will add lemon juice and oil too
4051 2018-05-21 16:27:23 Well actually Scotland could have a Stock Exchange indeed they did have before  oil discovery.
I think unlikely but you see WMD are in Scottish sovereign territory if they decided to impound and demand their share as part of settlement  ..
4052 2018-05-21 16:27:21 Heeheehee. “Essential oil” people... right up there with vegans.

4054 2018-05-21 16:27:17 Citizen's United has taken this to a place that the dollars are so huge that politicians truly are bought and sold. If someone tries to buck the system his buddy who needs the $ won't let him. GOP is sold to guns, oil, banks. etc. Dems not so bad, #Vote for them 2018 at least.
4055 2018-05-21 16:27:13 (not Republicans as people)
GOP Agenda: 
MORE war
More divide
More oil
More pollution
More corruption
More corporate benfits
LESS income
Less healthcare
Less energy security
Less nature
Less moral leadership
Less personal benefits.  [8]

4058 2018-05-21 16:27:08 At least this time Trump did not talk about invading Iraq (supposedly to fight ISIS) with Russia's help to steal their oil. We would keep what we take Russia could keep what they take.
4059 2018-05-21 16:27:08 @ColinCowherd  You know nothing of the City of Houston. Oil is big, however we also have the largest Medical Center in the World ! Biotech research in the medical center is huge with over $3 billion in recent expansion. Oh yea forgot to mention NASA & 1000's of other companies.
4060 2018-05-21 16:26:58 You shouldn't lie.
4061 2018-05-21 16:26:55 It does not sound crazy in the least. Nor did it when we went into Iraq. Nukes are a deterrent, but overhead on the balance sheet. The world runs on oil and it is income.
4062 2018-05-21 16:26:53 Oh cool, another way to jack up the price of oil. Russia wins again.

4064 2018-05-21 16:26:30 one of these days saw a joke about how millenials thinks that coconut oil and something else will solve everything. funny stuff
4065 2018-05-21 16:26:30 even parents & wives of soldiers marched Many times demanding their children 2 come back from these wars for oil disguised as wars against terrorism. we know USA is oil hungry and the war even now in Syria is driven by oil.  their next target is Iran mow. when will it ever stop?
4066 2018-05-21 16:26:29 GST (max upto 28%) on OIL, if accepted by all states, will bring the prices down.
Blaming @narendramodi for deregulated oil prices is not fair.
The difference money is with OIL companies balance sheet  BUT not in MODI or @BJP4India reps SWISS accounts.
4067 2018-05-21 16:26:26 Basically.  Season up some veggies and grill them make a plate of them, maybe with sauce or some truffle oil and you have a damn good meal. No need to ruin great cuisines.
4068 2018-05-21 16:26:26 I will never understand the Naija market. Someone is claiming to sell a glow oil. Her own skin looks terrible
4069 2018-05-21 16:26:23 When rumors of this came out, I registered my disgust w/ Netflix. Told them I would pull the plug on them if they did it even though I would miss some of their other content. Lady said she would pass along my sentiments. I'm sure she did, right into the waste bin.
4070 2018-05-21 16:26:22 Incorrect
4071 2018-05-21 16:26:20 Yeah and when the media do that, the sheep follow. It happens all the time. One week we're all supposed to hate Iran, then Russia, then we have to hate a regime who just happen to have lots of oil.
4072 2018-05-21 16:26:16 I completely understand they’re just doing their job, but I’m here for JUST AN OIL CHANGE! Nothing else... unless of course it’s free

4079 2018-05-21 16:25:27 Increased support to Taliban by Iran as retaliation could put Pakistan in a spot since Saudi backed groups in Pakistan will come under attack from Iran backed Taliban. Iran would like to wen Pakistan away from Saudi by offering more oil supplies
4080 2018-05-21 16:25:26 It’s so annoying getting an oil change.
4081 2018-05-21 16:25:22 Isn't the Saudi Crown Prince entertaining the Ven. Prez today? What is Trump trying to get from Ven. ? Their oil or more money for the 666 building?  We know it has nothing g to do w/the treatment if it's citizens, just look at PR.

4089 2018-05-21 16:24:20 It is just an excuse made by imperialist to invade middle East nations and to sell their weapons and explore their oil resources
4090 2018-05-21 16:24:13 Europe is making money in Iran ...and getting oil from them ....of course they don't want that cash cow to stop ...Obama gave Iran 150 billion ...how much did the Europe nations give?? That's right ..Nothing ...so they HAVE NO SAY IN IT!!! #outnumbered
4091 2018-05-21 16:23:49 Thats what i call चमन चूतियों की बारात। 

Please also mention crude oil rate.
4092 2018-05-21 16:23:42 Right. And if you want an insight into why Manmohan lost, ask yourself why Indian oil prices are 10% higher than May 2014 levels today, but International prices 40% lower? Manmohan tried to keep prices down. It backfired and oil industry engineered a suitable change of government
4093 2018-05-21 16:23:27 My boss was looking my tattoos and asked me why i had a cup with purple stuff pouring out. I told her it was grape soda  she said “more like grape oil”.. who been letting this white woman in idaho listen to future is what i wanna know

4098 2018-05-21 16:22:53 International crude oil prices has topped at 130$ at barrel during 2014. From last four years MODI’s Govt. has been not passing down the benefits of low crude oil price.
4099 2018-05-21 16:22:44 The BJP spkmn again gv a challenge to the citizen. They robbed the tax from us to build toilets, roads and other privileges the deserves with the margin they gained with less priced crude oil. Nw v can't expect any such dev as the crude oil prc is high now.

Just a small fact. I agree not very imp
4124 2018-05-21 16:20:54 How about removing all Energy Charges.  Then it would be easier to implement this and similar brilliant projects.  We believe Oil, Gas and Renewable profits should pay for Free Energy for the NHS.  #NHS
4125 2018-05-21 16:20:54 yeah my only point was that we should not only succeed as a country at the expense of others lives, because then something is fundamentally wrong and not that we should give up oil.

4137 2018-05-21 16:19:34 Also cull out what was the Govt subsidy and how much loss the oil companies were carrying in their books. Then we can decide

4147 2018-05-21 16:18:42 According to international observers, it was free and fair. Carter himself called Venezuela's electoral system the best he had seen in 92 observation missions.

It's way better than yours.

Stop falling for your country's propaganda. They just want to invade/coup and get the oil.
4148 2018-05-21 16:18:37 War has proven to be good for US economy and markets.

Is the Iran war coming? US, Israel & even Saudi would love it (other than Shia-Sunni dominance in ME, Aramco IPO & oil prices).

Anything possible until US Presidential election of 2020.

Post 2020 - depends, but less likely.
4149 2018-05-21 16:18:30 @FLOURNOYFarrell The goals for SAUDI ARABIA are a regime change & the end IRAN oil sales. ISRAEL's goal is to decimate IRAN, which will never happen. Do POMPEO & others in the illegitimate, POTUS admin think that RUSSIA won't defend its strongest ally in the MIDDLE EAST?

4162 2018-05-21 16:16:43 Congress in its worst time was better than present BJP Govt. Remember when crude oil was Rs 115 per barrel they sold petrol cheaper than this Govt. #FuelPriceHike
4163 2018-05-21 16:16:42 When the national average for gas exceeds $2.60 a 
gallon, the consumer cuts back on the excessive drives.
This is not good for the economy and @realDonaldTrump needs to rip into Big Oil and force them to curtail the excessive gas prices or penalties will ensue.
4164 2018-05-21 16:16:34 What measure would India Inc, take to reduce or to control crude oil prices so that general people of India get relief from hiking all sectors of commodity prices.
4165 2018-05-21 16:16:27 Here is a solution, stay out of there. Find oil alternatives and let the Mid East go their own ways.
4166 2018-05-21 16:16:22 yet we still consistently fight for oil and economic gain, which again, i dont accept as an absolute need
4167 2018-05-21 16:16:19 @ndtv @ravishndtv Sir you compared petrol prices between 2012 and 2018 basis current crude oil prices and was wondering why petrol is costly than 2012 primary reason no subsidy inflation adjusted rupee and no reduction in excise duty #impartialnewsreporting #nomisleadingfacts

4176 2018-05-21 16:15:10 That is a shame. I’d have thought I’d find a towel shot in my feed this morning. I guess you can’t depend on others to get the job done. Noted for next time. Lol

4178 2018-05-21 16:15:08 @ravishndtv Sir you compared petrol prices between 2012 and 2018 basis current crude oil prices and was wondering why petrol is costly than 2012 primary reason no subsidy inflation adjusted rupee and no reduction in excise duty #impartialnewsreporting #nomisleadingfacts
4179 2018-05-21 16:14:56 Don't forget commodities. Stablecoin(s) that work like a futures contract against common commodities (lithium, coffee, oil, corn, etc) would be super useful - better measures of value than fiat.
4180 2018-05-21 16:14:55 Of fuel oil? Yes, but that's a question of excise duty rather than customs duty payable. There's a customs union, not an excise union. That doesn't stop the vast majority of goods being subject to the customs union and being in free circulation once in the EU customs territory.
4181 2018-05-21 16:14:39 Aku baca di beberapa artikel sih face oil tetep butuh sih. Cmiiw
4182 2018-05-21 16:14:38 When we can get oil off the federal dime, that is a good discussion. Over 100 years of federal support should be enough for any industry.

4184 2018-05-21 16:14:35 What is the best oil to cook with?
I’ve been staying away from vegetable oil, using either coconut or olive oil. I want to know if there’s better options
4185 2018-05-21 16:14:34 I don’t think it’s no such thing as $20-$30 oil changes no more  lowest thing I’ve seen is $50
4186 2018-05-21 16:14:32 Thank @MahaalGhareeb ! If you have more stories or documentation on the oil pollution and health concerns we'd be interested in it
4187 2018-05-21 16:14:04 hash oil is the best of all oils

4189 2018-05-21 16:13:57 Dilbit is just crude oil. Nobody wants to spill it. Stop your nonsense please and focus on protecting Amsterdam, where oil tankers are completely out of control.

4192 2018-05-21 16:13:34 If ever petrol and diesel prices never went up and your rule you can boast abt it. If ever you knew little abt international oil price and market mechanism u wud not ve uttered. Definitely this will not get into head of misleading Congmen

4194 2018-05-21 16:13:28 Are all Coconut Oils created equal?
How would you compare the brands you use?
Do you  rotate brands to compare quality?
What's the difference between  Soybean oil and Coconut Oil?

4200 2018-05-21 16:13:03 Deirdre Michie, Chief Executive of Oil & Gas UK, is also positive about the news. “This is great news and an exciting start to the new year. A global leader like Shell making a commitment on this scale demonstrates the investment potential the U.K. Continental Shelf still holds.
4201 2018-05-21 16:13:01 And when electric vehicles start to break even with gas ones there will be some sort of new tax to make up for the lost revenue from oil ...all liberal bullshite
4202 2018-05-21 16:12:52 exactly. James 1 teaches us a double-minded man (woman) is unstable in all his (her) dealings. This seems apt.
4203 2018-05-21 16:12:50 That's a brake pad sauteed in 10,000 mile motor oil
4204 2018-05-21 16:12:42 And last ultimate point, present administration has applied sanctions unilaterally which are likely affecting the commercial interests of some european companies, like french TOTAL oil company. Which company will replace it ? A Chinese one which TOTAL signed a joint venture with!
4205 2018-05-21 16:12:36 I don't believe that anybody in this US Gov is really interested in the freedom of the Iranian people. Probably the mullah regime is awful, but the US Gov is only interested in power and oil in this region. Since 100 years! Nobody can any longer trust them
4206 2018-05-21 16:12:31 Good God Keith, not you too. This line is so juvenile and tired. Yes, we need to change the way we do just about everything in response to enviro crisis. That will require us starting somewhere.  If "but you still  use oil" is the best plan you've got, then kindly step aside.
4207 2018-05-21 16:12:23 Worst petroleum taxation in the world .Excise duty, Value Added Tax(VAT) and Dealer commission almost contributes to 50% of the total price of the oil currently in India.
Actual price is 39₹
All taxation combined price becomes more than double .

4208 2018-05-21 16:12:22 Some of the largest oil sands companies are 
HQ'd in Canada, recent research indicates a majority of investors in the oil sands are foreign, which means a majority of the profits flow out of Canada to the US, China, and Europe.

4213 2018-05-21 16:11:49 Thank you, that is great news. If it would be too much to ask could you also tell me whether the same product or it's packaging was produced using any derivative of the Oil Palm plant?
4214 2018-05-21 16:11:48 ...Public healthcare increased by 3x. Then Maduro took over, 70% of the economy was privatised, the oil crisis occurred and the country collapsed. Nothing to do with socialism, everything to do with economic mismanagement and privatisation.

4220 2018-05-21 16:11:25 What about Olive oil?
4221 2018-05-21 16:11:24 Instead of ranting, stop using your car and bike. Cripple the tax income of Govt. and use public transport. That way you need not care about the tax or the price. Take all your commies to the band. Oil firms are there not to make losses.
4222 2018-05-21 16:11:23 You know ONGC suffered losses of over Rs 6500 Cr in that transaction involving buyout of GSPC .. it had no oil reserves yet ONGC bought it

4227 2018-05-21 16:10:59 Oil & water doesn't mix but BJP has successfully mixed religion with development! Although there is no connection between two.
4228 2018-05-21 16:10:53 And don’t forget about the permanent 30% corporation tax cuts he gave the oil companies. Going to have the biggest profits ever.
4229 2018-05-21 16:10:52 The @60Minutes piece over @theranos was awesome. How is @eholmes2003 not in jail? She’s selling snake oil! Lock her up!

4247 2018-05-21 16:09:03 I can give you pointers but the recipe is literally an Iron Chef type of abomination. I made a failed caramel sauce with egg yolks, butter, brown/palm sugar, coconut milk, salt. Added a cup or so to pancake mix, with two eggs & coconut oil.
4248 2018-05-21 16:09:03 and modi might even claim he struck oil like he lied during sellout of Gujarat State Petroleum GSPC to ONGC @payalbhayana @LevinaNeythiri
4249 2018-05-21 16:08:57 Right,  headed to the Bakken to discuss how the dept can bypass laws to help big oil I'm sure.
4250 2018-05-21 16:08:55 Exposing the termites by naming a former banker to the Treasury? A former oil/coal exec to the EPA? A former Exxon exec to the State Department? What about Michael Flynn? Manafort? Trump campaign execs who are indicted by the FBI and pleaded guilty? How is that not corrupt?

4254 2018-05-21 16:08:42 It's my biggest gripe with UK takeaways. It's so unhealthy and doesn't need to be  true Italian pizza isn't swimming in cheese and oil. True Asian food isn't all deep fried. Weird we suffer it

4256 2018-05-21 16:08:39 They need dollars to stabilize their currency and operate oil/gas trade. Furthermore, they only have 1800 metric tonnes of gold, the US has 8100. It would be event more counterproductive financially
4257 2018-05-21 16:08:05 I agree with you on that Tom! My issue begins where the pipeline ends and the plan to ship 550 000 barrels if heavy, flammable oil through Metro Vancouver more than once everyday, vs the occasional tanker a handful of times each month.
4258 2018-05-21 16:07:45 INDCs as per #ParisAgreement India has To reduce carbon emission intensity of the GDP by (32 - 35%) or (1/3rd) from 2005 levels.
so, Despite fall of international prices for crude oil, India has kept high excise duty and thus reduced the possible increase in carbon emissions
4259 2018-05-21 16:07:42 When will the petrol prices drop ?

4303 2018-05-21 16:02:53 Spot on mate. If an oil company has a spill we don’t ban the mining of it - instead they get fined plus have to clean it up. Emmanuel’s fucked up here not the farmers. Make an example of them to clean the industry up.

4308 2018-05-21 16:02:27 Pero que se apuren porque si se tardan más, no va ha haber “oil “ para sancionar ! Al ritmo que la producción de PDVSA decae, en unos meses, ya ni habrá empresa para sancionar !
4309 2018-05-21 16:02:19 It really is! It can be used to make fibers for clothing, oil from the seeds, pulp for paper, and it contains almost no THC. It's good stuff.

4311 2018-05-21 16:02:10 Helping Russian oil prices with less Iranian oil on the market . We see right through this BS move . Middle East Peace talks?? Shouldn't we be getting rid of the Sunni backed Taliban ? How many years in Afghanistan and at a cost of 60 billion a year ? America First ? MAGA ? BS
4312 2018-05-21 16:02:02 Dumbest Tweet of the Day!!!!

FYI, Venezuela's economy is based on oil. When oil prices crashed so did their economy. Socialism vs. Capitalism was not relevant.
4313 2018-05-21 16:02:02 People never want to hear the truth. It's much easier to sell "they have nukes" or "they are dictators", yadda yadda yadda. That sells better than "we need their oil"

4315 2018-05-21 16:01:59 I didn't really think to explain anything else beyond just "sorry officer". He asked what I was doing in So. Virginia. I told him I was writing a book. He said something about hoping it wasn't about police officers and chuckled. I didn't laugh. This was my first speeding ticket.
4316 2018-05-21 16:01:57 I disagree. Oil is responding late, to stock surge. Price is rising at the worst time, a period when consumption spikes. I expect consumers will again treat gas stations as commodity exchanges and over consume. Thus driving the price higher.

4327 2018-05-21 16:01:08 Oil Price Should Come Under GST. Why Not Taking Initiative in this Regard ?Accusing State Govt. on Oil Price Hike; is a Foolish Act, Nothing Else. Further, If Petroleum Price has been Decontrolled..Why it always happens before election..price drops...& After election Going UP..?
4328 2018-05-21 16:01:08 USA is awash and exporting USA! Stop exporting! High Gas  prices are being perpetrated on USA Main St consumers at a time when finally we are Getting Up, by Greedy Oil Speculators especially EU trying to Harm our @realDonaldTrump economy for Iran
4329 2018-05-21 16:01:06 Trump's latest move against Russia is imposing sanctions on nations who indulge in defence/oil ties with Russia. Naturally it'll affect India if India isn't excluded. As ties with the West fall to new lows Vladimir Putin courts India by inviting Prime Minister Modi for a visit.

4337 2018-05-21 16:00:14 Typo, was supposed to say "Iran" is the last oil stronghold (outside of Russia/China). We know we can't risk war with them, so we control all the oil outside them, and in turn, we isolate and control them

4352 2018-05-21 15:59:28 Enjoy the oil price hikes too. Well, you may not, but sanctions on Iran will make Trump's donors and oil barons in Texas very very rich indeed.
4353 2018-05-21 15:59:28 Nope, not according to studies done in BC that were not funded by oil industry.
4354 2018-05-21 15:59:26 Ont & Que buy Tanker Oil from Venezuela’s Killer Dictator who arrested Opposing Party.

4368 2018-05-21 15:58:32 Any government either taking a high moral ground for lower oil prices or blaming someone else for high oil prices are fooling . They have zero skin in the game . Better people realize it and desist from attributing any correlation while voting .

4377 2018-05-21 15:58:14 Socialism is wrong but there is more to the story than that. There was mass corruption and overspending and bad budgeting. They put too much faith in oil and oil prices collapsed and they also started printing more money causing mass inflation.
4378 2018-05-21 15:58:14 Today our team made 28700 profit in crude oil...
4379 2018-05-21 15:58:11 How precisely is the USA stopping the country with the biggest oil reserves on the planet buying food for 70% of its people ? What is it doing to create a 18,000% inflation rate ?

4384 2018-05-21 15:57:51 Crude oil can be so manipulated, you can but from so many people. A promise to buy, does not mean anything. So why is the US trying to be number one in crude oil. DUMB. Old white men think they rule the world.
4385 2018-05-21 15:57:26 Yea. And we all ride horses and have oil derricks in our back pastures too. #stupid
4386 2018-05-21 15:57:26 I agree with it. More should examine the issues that way.

4391 2018-05-21 15:56:48 So he puts our farmers livelihood in jeopardy and then tweets he rescued them from financial devastation. A con artist with snake oil has more integrity than trumpee has.

4421 2018-05-21 15:53:55 Just explained on @ndtv @vishnushome there are 3 reasons for high taxes on refined products: (1) large import component (but oil has no excise) (2) Inelastic consumption demand (3) pollution externality, carbon tax element

4424 2018-05-21 15:53:29 We've passed the point of no return with plastics. We need waste to energy.  Plastics can be thought of as a mid stage between primary resource -oil - and terminal use - fuel.

4425 2018-05-21 15:53:19 I don't trust the government, no matter what party is in control. Too easy for them to decide I'm not the right sort of person, since I fight for limited government, Constitution, and individual liberty. Neither binary party is strong on those.
4426 2018-05-21 15:53:18 With oil at 80 a barrel that would be the time to go, it may even pay for itself if crude stays in the 80 vicinity, then one day get it gelling and make some cash, what are they waiting for

His model, Venezuela, has almost limitless oil; Chavez still failed...

4432 2018-05-21 15:52:24 tbf there were many factors leading up to WWII

The world was a different place too
Colonial expansion, fight for expansion

Also the embargo of natural resources/oil essentially made it somewhat of a foregone conclusion

4434 2018-05-21 15:52:12 I started putting Jamaican castor oil on my head yesterday and I had a dream last night my hair was down to my butt... so imma take it as a premonition that it’s already working
4435 2018-05-21 15:52:11 Honestly, I could bear the ghost times but the lie that made me drink oil like crazy, is what wouldn't koto..
4436 2018-05-21 15:52:11 @margekessel  Just finished dinner for one ! Scottish salmon finished with thyme, chives and coriander. Tomato with young onion in olive oil and herbs and mashed potatoes. For dessert fresh strawberries with fresh flat cheese and brown sugar. Yummy .... I'm stuffed !
4437 2018-05-21 15:52:03 Nope, pretty sure that's the point you made.
4438 2018-05-21 15:52:02 Any comment on the @DonaldJTrumpJr meeting at trump tower with representatives of middle East oil producers?  Asking for Eric Prince.
4439 2018-05-21 15:51:56 Agreeing with your demands isn't the only way to care.
4440 2018-05-21 15:51:49 And who do all the oil exec's vote for? Maybe there is a conspiracy or collusion?
4441 2018-05-21 15:51:39 I actually agree with you on this one, doesn’t happen often but Chim’s would be a great fit for the Oil.
4442 2018-05-21 15:51:38 Coincidentally those US sanctions on Iran increase profits for Putin/Russian oil.
How cozy.
Thank you Donny.

4447 2018-05-21 15:51:12 At UPA time crude oil price was  108$/Barrel = petrol price  -73 Rupees
Now NDA time crude oil price is approx 50$/Barrel = petrol price - 76 Rupees
4448 2018-05-21 15:51:10 Correct, and I'd think that more of my fellow liberals would have reached a realization about the dangers of curtailing any right, given the current administration and Congress.
4449 2018-05-21 15:51:09 Ok. I'm not sure if you meant for that to be some kind of gotcha statement, but it's really not. Go...ask her, by all means.
4450 2018-05-21 15:51:06 Does this revelation from the CEO at Shell say a lot about the future of fossil fuels? It seems so, with Ben Van Beurden, 59, saying the demand for oil could peak within the next 15 to 20 years. It came just as the Anglo-Dutch oil company said it was investing
4451 2018-05-21 15:50:57 Increases amount of oil that Russia/Putin will be selling.

4456 2018-05-21 15:50:41 But even if that fails to appear, Shell would argue that the industry will invest so little, future production will fall, creating a shortage of oil that will result in a price recovery. 

The BG deal leaves Shell with plenty of self-help options.

4470 2018-05-21 15:49:29 Fuel prices depend on crude oil prices, the rupee $ exchange rate and local taxes. Both crude oil prices and $ are higher and govt has limited control on that. Hence the govt should lower the very high existing taxes on petrol and diesel.
4471 2018-05-21 15:49:29 1st 100cr, 2nd 150cr, 3rd 15cr, 4th 25cr and ministry-all denied by Congis themselves. 2day again 2 craps come out & claim: - 1. All money from Oil Price has been pumped for BJP in KAR & 2. 4500cr & 11500cr spent for elections by BJP.  CA trains and Congis fail again and again.
4472 2018-05-21 15:49:27 conspiracy theory  Big oil is squeezing the American public on gas prices so they can convince everyone they need natural gas because it's cheaper however they will find a way to poke our eyes out on that to.
4473 2018-05-21 15:49:16 Hey Donovich, is that the dossier started by the Republican Party? The one that’s been proven right time and time again, like a grubby deal for billions from an oil deal, because we all know you need money as you are a multi bankrupt and failed businessman.  #trumpcolluded

Before 2014, crude oil prices were controlled by Congress.But now they're controlled by international prices.Modiji has gone to Russia to lay a pipeline that will be connected to Petrol Pumps directly.

4488 2018-05-21 15:48:34 Compare with Crude oil prices at that time. Don't give stupid explanations.
4489 2018-05-21 15:48:32 Thats filled with oil
4490 2018-05-21 15:48:30 Yeah, something desparately wrong with war. Everything
Associated with America in the Middle East is tainted by our interest in oil. My dream is renewables that remove us from the disaster of the ME. We’re going in the wrong direction. This is not leadership.

4491 2018-05-21 15:48:23 97% of the time when it's 15°+ and the sun is out you'll find me in my garden, covered in baby oil, sizzling away 
4492 2018-05-21 15:48:06 Excuse me? So Scotland's oil paid for Thatcher to de-industrialise Scotland and now you're telling me you think Scotland shouldn't keep the wealth in its own waters unless we pay back debt we had no say in taking on or where it was spent? You're no unionist mate. Assimilationist
4493 2018-05-21 15:48:05 Given rangebound of crude oil and PTA futures, China local PFY prices in Jiangsu and Zhejiang were generally stable, with sporadic corrections. Market transaction was lackluster, as wait-and-see stance prevailed, seeing downstream mills mainly cover shorts.

4517 2018-05-21 15:45:34 Sad day in America.  That this ever happened in the first place.  That we need to fund raise to pay our bills.   That these children no longer have their mother.   That being said...did the THC oil treatment not work?  Or was it never even tried...
4518 2018-05-21 15:45:25 This govt unlike UPA has done a lot to reduce oil prices impact. Channels are doing drama for TRP . Some of the anchors are really stupid & idiotic without any understanding. Pitiable media

4542 2018-05-21 15:42:47 This opinion is so absurd, I don't even know how to start explaining global markets to you. Alas, Putin is raising the prices for oil and gas because Russia depends on it for 50% of their entire economy. They are the largest supplier of fossil fuels in the world.

4556 2018-05-21 15:41:17 Unless they *really* alter their refining capacity (takes years) to process light shale oil and/or they stuff their strategic reserves with de-facto unprocessable raw material, this is hardly the case.

4558 2018-05-21 15:40:44 I don't think crude oil prices and currency exchange rates are India specific only. Is our financial and currency system weaker than that of siri lanka and Bangla Desh that oil prices there are far lower than in India. How come?.

7. Dry! (Overnight or at least for 4hrs)

Try to think of a way someone could "protest oil" while not using any. Under your special criteria, it's not possible.

I'll say again, your belief that these people are hypocrites, and that somehow that means anything, speaks to your attitude not theirs

4568 2018-05-21 15:40:15 No cord to drag around or avoid while mowing, no fuel to refill, no oil maintenance. Yup, we definitely think you're winning here.
4569 2018-05-21 15:40:15 君を笑わせるためなら、僕は尻から油を出すよ。
4570 2018-05-21 15:40:13 Australia seems to like burning carbon more than its reefs. Irony.  Glad you are standing up to the pigs of oil.
4571 2018-05-21 15:40:11 when crude prices touched 30dollars did govt reduced oil prices
4572 2018-05-21 15:40:10 My dad damn funny !!! I bought a air purifier to put in my living room and once I apply few drop of essential oil he said no smell at all, then I apply 10 more drop -.- he said eh!!!! So smelly
4573 2018-05-21 15:40:10 Up in Firestone & this old cat in here snapping about his daughter boyfriend riding around in her car lmao my guy said “sorry joker don’t even check the oil in the damn car” 
4574 2018-05-21 15:39:50 Fair point. But I think you will find that spending on car fuel both per mile and even more so in absolute terms is declining fast. Choice of period will affect this - 20 years ago the price of oil (WTI) was $21.41. Also much of the rise is rail fares...
4575 2018-05-21 15:39:50 The price of petrol and petroleum products must have connected to the international crude oil. Compare it with the price "2012".How could Bangladesh provides with lower price than India. It should be under GST and the Reliance Group must be stopped giving subside.

4579 2018-05-21 15:39:35 I'm sure the 16 million Jews, 20 million Russians and 20 Million Chinese would beg to differ. Even the Japanese Americans.
4580 2018-05-21 15:39:10 for the hedge funds i would not be worried at all... they are sheep. The goal was something between 50-100.... call it 75-80... and we are there. Opec playing with expectations.... Oil Majors are not even investing.... That tells u something....
4581 2018-05-21 15:39:07 All my dawgs been poppin, like oil or somethin’

4587 2018-05-21 15:38:27 Why can't we have a deregulation-regulation decision based on global crude oil price and rupee ? If crude surpasses 80 or rupee breaches 66 ,regulate petrol diesel price . Else keep deregulated .
4588 2018-05-21 15:38:26 Sayang! Mas mura kasi kaya yun binili ko haha. Hinahaluan ko ng tea tree oil

4591 2018-05-21 15:38:12 After GST implimentation Oil companies, have renegotiated all contracts and tenders and forced their vendors to reduce rates stating we were getting the benifit of GST. They wanted to enjoy the fruits of GST, but they donot want to pass the benifit to its customers

4599 2018-05-21 15:37:22 @fayedsouza Please add dividend earned by govt from ongc, oil India, ioc to the money made from common man.  Loot is much more
4600 2018-05-21 15:37:17 But none of those are the concern of the CPPIB. They might assess whether global policies will decrease demand for oil fast enough to make the investment too high a risk. Or perhaps lawsuits will remove profits.
4601 2018-05-21 15:37:16 After i get my oil changed I’m getting me another belly ring 
4602 2018-05-21 15:37:05 I believe so :)   though that's just me- I am  generally a happy consumer of olive oil, avocado oil, coconut oil, butter, lard, ghee, duck and goose fat .
4603 2018-05-21 15:36:59 Yes History F.C as you'd put it. I call you Oil Riggers F.C that's all you are. Plastic flags provided by the club when you played was embarrassing just like the 4-3, 3-0 and 1-2 wins over ye
4604 2018-05-21 15:36:51 The oil price has enjoyed a modest recovery, while the weaker pound is boosting the value of their dollar denominated dividends for UK investors. 

Against that background, Royal Dutch Shell’s third quarter results received a warm reception from investors.
4605 2018-05-21 15:36:50 No ma'am, Zion Oil & Gas has been searching for oil in Israel for 18 years. This has nothing to do with Trump & Oil.
  A foot note though Zion has had a large discovery in Israel and is in the process of testing the well as we speak.

4608 2018-05-21 15:36:27 In relation to crude oil prices, right?
4609 2018-05-21 15:36:25 So you advocate for teens shot dead, but a baby ripped piece by piece from the womb is totes ok. Cool, and this coming from the clown who wants to lecture me on empathy...

4611 2018-05-21 15:36:22 @narendramodi We voted for you Sir!!!...we believed in your clean and prosperous thought process Sir!!!..we still believe you but your indifference towards escalating oil prices and apathy towards middle class may force us to think otherwise
4612 2018-05-21 15:36:12 I agree 100%; it's like water and oil

4622 2018-05-21 15:35:29 it’s non comedogenic, heavy so mix it with a lightweight moisturizer that absorbs well like neautrogena hydro boost, or cerave daily moirsturizer or any other water based moirsturizers and its literally liquid crack u could fuck my eyeball with vitamin e oil
4623 2018-05-21 15:35:12 Why dont you compare excise duty as well?
Modi government has increased excise duty whenever price of crude oil decreased. They didnt give opportunity to people to enjoy oil at lowest price. Reason is
We should not be used to lowest price.

4633 2018-05-21 15:34:05 There is no viable answer to the refugee problem while the West continues to rely on the Middle East’s oil, and at the same time supplies the weapons and drives the conflicts that creates the problem in the first place
4634 2018-05-21 15:34:02 Look at the level of toxicity that the misconstrued idea of 'secularism' has brought! They have the audacity to decry Hindus in the land of Hindus! These must be roasted & fried in hot boiling oil. Rascals.

If I am to use a serum, eye cream, oil and the matrix, what would be the correct order? Thanks!

4643 2018-05-21 15:33:21 It's not bad, but... Maybe you can toast the tomatoes over a hot pan no oil, and use fresh cilantro.

4648 2018-05-21 15:33:01 I go to read your "swamp gas" report and the first thing to pop up is an ad for "Zion oil" with a caricature of the USA shaking hands with Israel promoting drilling for oil. Is this why Trump was so eager to move the embassy......oil???
4649 2018-05-21 15:33:00 Facts and feelings are two different things. No, I don't feel like it happens every other week. I don't need stats, but if you're going to embellish what is factual because that's how you feel...that doesn't work. Also, I have great sympathy and empathy for the situation.

4663 2018-05-21 15:31:34 There is no case to reduce the oil prices by Govt . High price of petrol / diesel will expedite the process of alternatives like electric , solar etc . It will also lead to reduction of pollution causing Petrol and diesel cars especially privately owned .

4671 2018-05-21 15:30:59 KinderMorgan's economic probability hit the skids when the price of oil plummeted 4 yrs ago. They want Cdns to pay for their losses. Corporate kingpin Morneau is just the guy to do them that solid? No conflict of interest there.

4691 2018-05-21 15:29:54 I've finally figured out that my skin is better off using cleansing water as my pre-cleanse instead of oil cleanser on a daily basis.

I only use my oil cleanser on days I put on makeup & when I use clay mask.

Skincare is science, magic & mystery. All at the same time.

4695 2018-05-21 15:29:27 I think you are over stating the case. I understand it doesn’t sink at first but could over days depending on the circumstance such as sediment in the water which is a concern in our waters. This doesn’t take away from the devastation an oil spill causes

4700 2018-05-21 15:29:20 Exactly. There are plenty of discussions to be had on this theory and how it’s best used (or not used). I detest lazy arguments, and this Opener strategy has brought them out in droves.

4705 2018-05-21 15:28:42 Mr Khan is uneconomical with truth. They did not absorb the home but as they did not pay for oil imported from IRAN and that had to be done by NDA Govt, That is the basic reason how they controlled the price.
4706 2018-05-21 15:28:36 hopefully as EU is realising US is not a friend, they will realise Russia can be. Heard Merkel was trying to get Russia back as G8- partner again. Maybe with oil concerns they realise they will only be left with 40% more expensive oil prices with US. That we all want peace.

4713 2018-05-21 15:27:43 Definately. Then why did Modi make all that hue and cry before Lok Sabha Elections in 2014 for such high prices. He should have in fact asked UPA not to subsidize Oil prices in the larger interest of the country. Why there was no hike in oil price 4 -19 days?All political games.

4716 2018-05-21 15:27:25 1. Reduce oil price 
2. Ease tension among business class. The most hit class by govt policies is this.
3. Stop stooping to low levels while campaigning in elections.
4.Fulfill atleast some promises made at the time of elections.
4717 2018-05-21 15:27:23 @namo_office @narendramodi sir intervene in uncontroled oil price hike issue and lower down the rates immediately
4718 2018-05-21 15:27:16 Bio oil ดีนะ รอยแตกลายเพราะอ้วนเร็วตอนเด็ก เริ่มจางลงแทบไม่เห็นละถ้าไม่สังเกตดีดี
4719 2018-05-21 15:27:09 1.5 hours so far. Why should an oil change ever take this long?! I should have had them drive me home.

4722 2018-05-21 15:27:06 sautéed in soy/sesame oil. Basically a Korean banchan
4723 2018-05-21 15:27:00 We obviously put to many miles on the odometer this weekend. By the time the game started in Bemidji we looked like we needed an oil change.
4724 2018-05-21 15:26:54 Unless you want oil companies to rebuild all their refineries to process the kind of oil we use hear we will NEVER be oil independent. We could be oil NEUTRAL some day. The point is, when trump pulled out of Iran deal it sent the price for the kind of oil we need hear soaring.

4727 2018-05-21 15:26:38 What the US did to Flint and Puerto Rico is exactly what they have been attempting to do in Venezuela as Exxon attempts to sequester the largest oil supply to maintain their prices on a dead industry. Flint and PR need Bolivarian Rev. You probably do too. Viva Maduro
4728 2018-05-21 15:26:36 Thanks @LesSchwab for not screwing my oil cap on and now there’s oil all over my garage.
4729 2018-05-21 15:26:33 I’m expecting the same results as if OPEC would have instituted an oil embargo on the US if they didn’t pull out of Vietnam in the 60’s & 70’s…
4730 2018-05-21 15:26:29 Oohh! We love your oil collection! We are so happy to see you making some blends! Thank you for sharing the love with us!

4732 2018-05-21 15:26:25 Modi will go one day but u cannot have cheap oil for ever. Just look at 1984-1998 period how petrol prices went up 5x even though crude prices did not go much up globally.

4745 2018-05-21 15:25:14 Just wait until the Israel vs Arab/Iran war kicks in fully to see how high Oil prices can go.  Thanks to Trump as well.
4746 2018-05-21 15:25:09 Every people should try lesser use of fossil fuel and find alternative fuel. Otherwise oil rich countries 'll rule the world price of fuel.
4747 2018-05-21 15:25:09 We have to think ahead..how long are we going to be followers ? EV is a reality we have to catch up. And yes use oil till then but at a price.
4748 2018-05-21 15:24:54 They did impose the oil sanctions while Iran -hypothetically- was not pursuing the nuclear bomb, at least as both Iran and EU was saying.
Your second point about the strategy is more convincing though. I agree
4749 2018-05-21 15:24:52 Not able to understand the involvement of opposition in comparison in price rise  instead of Crude oil!
4750 2018-05-21 15:24:52 Dear Europe and China and others, you are the last loser of this game. USA and Russia need high oil prices and you need cheap. So think again and again before late.. Nobody care about iranian and M.E people just war is the best outcome for this zionist empire forever..

4753 2018-05-21 15:24:13 That Brent-WTI curve came in pretty quick. Think the market is starting to see there won't be any cutback at all in oil sully from Iran sanctions.  I'm prepping a video on this for tomorrow
4754 2018-05-21 15:24:12 Why government still allowed importation of palm oil in the country till now? This is discouraging to the local farmers in the pursue of agricultural revolution in Nigeria
4755 2018-05-21 15:24:07 That's the plan, they've all invested in oil and gas and making money off of us. There was a statement last year about Putin needed sanctions off so prices could go up, @realDonaldTrump accommodated him, he works for him, TREASON
4756 2018-05-21 15:23:59 State owned oil companies are poorly managed. They have to reduce their operational expenses. Take some decisive action
4757 2018-05-21 15:23:55 In your own piece... “Since the U.S. lifted restrictions on oil exports in late 2015, American crude exports surged and many countries have received U.S. oil cargoes, including China, and more recently—even the United Arab Emirates (UAE)...”
4758 2018-05-21 15:23:45 We already have the resources. 100% of oil revenues, 100% of income tax, 100% of collected VAT, 100% or corporation tax, 100% of generated income from electricity sales etc. etc. etc is better than 8.4%

4768 2018-05-21 15:22:28 GERS this year will be interesting as the final methodology tweeks are applied retrospectively, any future changes will only be very minor. We can then start looking at why on earth the UK would grant iSCot a geographical share of oil without reciprocity on debt?
4769 2018-05-21 15:22:24 What are the chances oil companies are inflating the price of gas to encourage a public backlash against a carbon tax?  There's a ton of money on the line.

4780 2018-05-21 15:20:37 Drilling deep to tap naturally occurring heat at Geothermal power facilities can cause earthquakes. With all the fracking that is going on in the estevan area with oil wells, I think we are looking for trouble with adding this to the mix. Was there a study done before okaying?
4781 2018-05-21 15:20:30 1. Crude Base Oil cost -(Price )

(159 litres of Crude oil )
C&F +Insurance - % of 1 

Refining cost per litre -  % of 1

Transportation cost per litre -  % of 1

Excise duty- Rs22--25

Commission to Dealers per litre - Rs.2.58

Base oil cost is more than actual price/barrel
4782 2018-05-21 15:20:28 Will stream this afternoon. Got some errands to run. Oil change (last one was before Agdq still only put 3k on since then). Gotta get a shot in the arm, store for foods.
4783 2018-05-21 15:20:25 Inflation started with Nixon and got worse under Ford (remember WIN, whip inflation now). Carter appointed Volcker who helped end it. The oil embargo was put in place to harm all the countries that supported Israel. Need more? Educate yourself with facts not rw misinformation.
4784 2018-05-21 15:20:22 Is there scope to make a case for rigging of polls in Karnataka and other states by oil companies ?
4785 2018-05-21 15:20:19 The govt. should reduce or regulate taxes to keep the oil prices within reasonable limits. Petrol/Diesel are such commodities,which are affecting the budget of each and every household .Why the govt.turns a deaf ear to vox populi and behaves like an arrogant dictator.?
4786 2018-05-21 15:20:12 I need to get my oil changed
4787 2018-05-21 15:20:05 Yes, I agree this is a really important point. I think Europe won't reimpose those oil/gas sanctions unless they think Iran is clearly pursuing nuclear weapons or they think the US has a viable strategy for successfully changing Iranian behavior.

4790 2018-05-21 15:19:48 RBI can very well start the oil window and avoid the pressure on Rupee .
4791 2018-05-21 15:19:41 To you, we get it, it doesn't matter. You believe no one other than the police and military should be armed. Good luck trying to repeal the 2A. At least you were honest about your desire to take everyone's guns.
4792 2018-05-21 15:19:41 The USA’s threat of renewed sanctions on Iran encourages
Iran and its counterparties to trade oil in non-USD currencies. This will
likely have negative implications for the US dollar.

4801 2018-05-21 15:18:48 coconut oil and a warm washcloth after works wonders
4802 2018-05-21 15:18:46 Why not GST on oil price?  Like other commodities had gst been imposed the price would come down to great extent. Such is the dishonesty of the government
4803 2018-05-21 15:18:39 If only solution is oil, be prepared to have it's prices double every 7-12 years. Per liter petrol is:
3rs in 1984 
18 RS in mid 1990s
30 RS in 2007.
70 RS in 2012.
Now 85+ by 2018

4815 2018-05-21 15:17:40 However we have to manage.
Cz this price hike is due to rise in crude oil price n so on.
Media sud make aware da ppl about this.
4816 2018-05-21 15:17:39 We understand that the UPA didn't clear it's dues to IRAN and need to route money towards development..but with India's population being sensitive towards prices of oil, dal, onion, tomatoes etc etc.. The govt must give some relief to the middle class!!! 
4817 2018-05-21 15:17:34 We are NOT oil independent. We import billions of barrels of oil per day. We also export billions of barrels per day. Both of these things have been happening for a really, really long time.

4823 2018-05-21 15:17:04 Supposedly CBD is legal but I went to a store that was selling it (like a health food store) and its main ingredients were just hemp oil and there was very little CBD in it. And it was expensive AF. Just one brand is available there hah, so I would be scared to bring it in.

People want certainty, after all. 

But I am not here to take the easy way out, nor to sell snake oil. 

I'm here to tell the truth about life as I see it.

And for me that's the most important goal.
4831 2018-05-21 15:16:34 I'd say I agree but the oil spills will be a train wreck until they figure out a way to sign good players who are willing to take a huge pay cut

Yeah, it's an older engine at 140K miles, so oil consumption may be a little higher than usual.
4838 2018-05-21 15:16:10 are we looking at another President who says they're going to deliver on more ways to lower the price of oil/gas...and then we get screwed again?

4841 2018-05-21 15:15:45 Trump's withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear deal has only one purpose...to drive oil prices up to benefit wall street and the Saudis!
4842 2018-05-21 15:15:45 As a UK registered oil company, UK uses 2% less oil products every year and is a dying business as Diesel cars are under attack - Shame really as diesel is 97% efficient and no one has found any other technology that comes close to it as a method of storing the suns energy
4843 2018-05-21 15:15:39 That lavender baby oil.  Must have all summer.  Love it.
4844 2018-05-21 15:15:35 I don’t understand the issue. There’s an election in 6 months that somebody has to pay for R’s to win. Do u think Big Oil can print money? No, they make the consumer pay for their candidate payola. This happens every election cycle. Get a clue.
4845 2018-05-21 15:15:33 Now  when d crude oil barrel prices hv plummeted 2 even 50 dollars or less , why there is steady incline in d fuel prices - a big ques.2ask
4846 2018-05-21 15:15:32 It is an absolutely disgusting remake, and completely inappropriate to be faced on an oil and gas commercial. #shameful
4847 2018-05-21 15:15:10 These people don't seem to realize that the #NRA receives 0 government funding while #PlannedParenthood gets millions upon millions.  And the latter group really DOES kill American children.  #Sad.

4853 2018-05-21 15:14:23 There is no doubt the higher oil price will spur on some activity.  Note though that this activity won't just be in oil.  The higher the oil price, the more competitive its competitors become.  There are some new kids on the block, and they will be responding too.

4856 2018-05-21 15:14:08 My point is that Nicolas' political upbringing happened mostly in Cuba. And Cuba only lacked oil. Some of them don't even see themselves living in Venezuela forever. They are like Carabobo's governor Lacava who is in charge of the State during his vacations from Spain.

4874 2018-05-21 15:13:15 For the 16th time this year, oil prices have increased. Including impact of TRAIN, price hikes per liter now total:

Diesel - Php10.10
Gasoline - Php9.67
Kerosene - Php10.15

Since Duterte became President, oil prices have already increased by Php15 to Php17 per liter.

4880 2018-05-21 15:12:35 Yes it does. The EU is either going to purchase expensive oil from Russia or Cheap oil from Iran or we have to subsidized their oil if we want them to go along with the Iran sanctions. US sanctions alone haven't worked is a small island like Cuba what makes you think they'll work

4901 2018-05-21 15:11:13 Goldman are the biggest sabre rattlers in the industry.When oil was trading at $30 last year they were predicting Oil to go to $10. Last week with it going up fast, Goldman were saying it's going to $150. So one shouldn't take take too much notice of what Goldman are seeing imho.

4922 2018-05-21 15:10:07 The EU import more than one fifth of Iran’s oil export. If they are no going to impose the oil sanctions, they will be helping Iran, and the effect of US sanctions will be minimal. The US adm have made it clear that it will not allow this to happen. It will take sometime though.
4923 2018-05-21 15:10:02 Funny the Fake President doesn't boast about how gas and heating oil prices have risen, yet our paychecks haven't.
Rich Get Richer, Poor Get Poorer.
4924 2018-05-21 15:10:01 Eliminating cap and trade and/or a carbon tax will help.  Ultimately oil prices are determined by international markets.  The lack of refining and pipeline capacity in Canada doesn't help.  Prices will be higher regardless of who is elected.

4938 2018-05-21 15:08:18 Indeed, but oil and gas are not really cheap, well cheaper than nuclear fussion power. In the long term renewable energy will be far cheaper and naturally far better for the planet. So much clout is with the big oil companies, they aren't going to let go of that

4950 2018-05-21 15:07:34 The oil curve flattening is a sign the market is topping out, not going higher.  Traders are closing out their front end positions, and buying further out.  This happens at tops, not bottoms.  It also creates a hedging opportunity allowing E&Ps to bring online higher cost wells
4951 2018-05-21 15:07:28 especially with all this insurance knowledge now… i’d open an agency so fuckin’ fast… or go into oil/gas… sell propane and propane accessories nshit.
4952 2018-05-21 15:07:27 Even bigshots like Tesla don't have proper infrastructure for EVs in USA till now, how long do you think India will take to adopt?

4977 2018-05-21 15:05:25 When you can control worldwide prices of oil to more manageable rates, then you can harp on being able to prevent rape of public through oil prices. Until then, your support of the real estate mafia of these goons is the rape I am referring to. All the stupid smileys wont help.
4978 2018-05-21 15:05:23 So do taxes and oil prices. The 100 rs a liter petrol will very well be a reality regardless of taxes. Solution is to adopt EVs and dig for oil in our own backyard.

4981 2018-05-21 15:05:03 Sit up straight and take long deep breaths. Try drinking hot coffee or using eucalyptus oil while steaming para maopen ying nasal blockage!
4982 2018-05-21 15:05:02 Iran is one of the biggest oil producers in the world, and one with the biggest deposits of minerals. What does America want to achieve? Cripple the rest of the world, or hugely inflate the bottom lines of US oil giants live Exxon Mobil and the rest.?

4990 2018-05-21 15:04:25 Yes, i take that point entirely.  It could have been because Wagner thought it would be easy to take back oil facilities and they are paid to do so. But i just thought it was interesting what journalists who went to Deir found.
4991 2018-05-21 15:04:22 Crude oil? Crude logic...
4992 2018-05-21 15:04:19 มีคนให้คุยทั้งวัน เจิ้งถิงคงชอบมากนะคะ 555555
4993 2018-05-21 15:04:10 Rich lobbyists live on Capitol Hill like Scott Pruitt’s oil lobbyist pal. He and Bernie prbly shop at the same Whole Foods on Capitol Hill
4994 2018-05-21 15:04:07 Yes i got it, but french will see it as an insult, it is in fact a huge misunderstanding but i feel like Felipe does not want to solve the problem with his last tweets i feel like he is pouring oil on the fire
4995 2018-05-21 15:04:01 Somebody take my car to get a oil change cause I def don’t feel like getting up.
4996 2018-05-21 15:04:00 At least have some discussion to bring crude oil from Russia, instead of defence deal of Billions.
4997 2018-05-21 15:03:48 Fling your fruit into the floor with even more ease! Guide the hot oil splatters into your eyes and onto your ceiling! All for a low price of $290 in 6 installments.
4998 2018-05-21 15:03:47 Really though. I take Fish Oil pills and a variety of vitamins. A few other things to balance mood and hormones. Getting old sucks.

5002 2018-05-21 15:03:26 Don't forget oil price gone up considerably since Feb as well so even more $$ coming to #myn
5003 2018-05-21 15:03:17 I did some math this weekend, and it turns out the few $ the Trump tax cut is saving me each month are essentially entirely absorbed by the increased cost of gas.  So my tax cut is being, in effect, funneled directly to oil companies.  USA!
5004 2018-05-21 15:03:16 Cleaning: less=more. Regular and gentle exfoliation is best to managing oil. Stuff that’s designed to strip oil from ur skin will deprive your skin of a protective layer and disturb the pH balance. Avoid cleansers with: alcohol, high pH soap, things with high acid content
5005 2018-05-21 15:03:13 Peace, love and coconut oil!
5006 2018-05-21 15:03:11 3) Fragmentation of oil settlement method gives declining demand for USD. Both USD and Euro have same prob of secular decline in value.

Oil priced at the margin. Relatively small shift of supply can send prices much higher.

5019 2018-05-21 15:02:26 What's the guarantee EVs won't support "ISIS type organisation in India"? You can't find oil where there's none.  Other countries too import a lot but their income is much higher.
5020 2018-05-21 15:02:19 Population growing 2% pa but oil demand growing 7-8%. Check data. Ur dislike for taxes won't solve problem.

5032 2018-05-21 15:01:26 No, none. And I'm right at my mileage to get an oil change too.
5033 2018-05-21 15:01:22 This country have huge crude potential after middle east , in Africa this is the country where people are more hope full for oil and gas Future
The only thing is country is ruined by its civil war and corrupt political situation

5039 2018-05-21 15:01:05 The government of Sao Tome & Principe has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Chris Noth in a seersucker wig.

5046 2018-05-21 15:00:38 Just realised that CBD products (oil, pot and crystals) with THC<0,2% is OTC in Italy.

5050 2018-05-21 15:00:34 Worse a lot of oil bill we pay goes to encourage ISIS type organization in India. 
For our own secularism sake we must end oil addiction. find oil here or adopt EVs where feasible.

5058 2018-05-21 15:00:14 Because we can’t buy oil from the Iranian market, which has reduced the supply, without reducing demand.
5059 2018-05-21 15:00:13 Probably the #Trump offer is not to bomb Iran in exchange for free access to Irans oil reserves and market for USA mafia corporations accordingly to "American national interest and VALUES" !

5073 2018-05-21 14:59:07 Bloomberg; "Maduro wins Venezuela elections; risking harsh oil sanctions"
US always claims to be promoting democracy but when someone they don't like wins, suddenly holding/winning an election is grounds for 'harsh sanctions'
Soon Trump won't have even a 'dictator friend' left.

5088 2018-05-21 14:57:48 Keep on increasing oil prices consumers will pay
5089 2018-05-21 14:57:47 You also should be aware price was at the same level when UPA ruled when crude oil was at rs100 US per barrel. Only difference is that now infra structure is being built with that money. Earlier it was laundered outside India by vested interests
5090 2018-05-21 14:57:30 I would dance lightly on the idea that religion is false information. But science and religion are water and oil for a reason. I'm not here to debate that reason, I am looking for reason only
5091 2018-05-21 14:57:24 Like raising the oil prices to make Putin and the Russian oil oligarchs richer because Trump couldn't remove - despite many attempts to thwart and delay - the Congress-mandated Russian oil sanctions? Yep.

5124 2018-05-21 14:54:51 I’m not in the top 1% so my taxes aren’t a whole lot better than they were. For most of us the tax cut meant another $20-$40 per paycheck. Let’s say it’s $1,000/yr. Great. Pulling out of the Iran deal (and the oil they had on the market) sent gas prices up. Your $20 per week cut
5125 2018-05-21 14:54:44 Resetting my oil service warning indicator myself after an oil change because either people forget or like last time they reset my power locks.
5126 2018-05-21 14:54:30 Since OPEC controls a large proportional of oil output, it exerts a strong influence on the global price of oil. When OPEC decides to reduce the output quotas of it's member countries, this will tend to drive up the price of oil as the supply diminishes.
5127 2018-05-21 14:54:26 PWEDE BANG UNG OIL KO NALANG SA MUKHA YUNG I PANG GAS KO SA MOTOR KO?
5128 2018-05-21 14:54:16 Iranian regime is evil + Iran has Oil, So think about that...

5133 2018-05-21 14:53:45 On the plus side, high oil prices will make renewables even more competitive than they already are.

5138 2018-05-21 14:53:07 Low prices discourage new exploration and high prices encourage alternate energy sources; but as you imply the converse of both are also true with their negative consequences. What is the solution? Seems large taxes on oil is the obvious answer if only it could be done.
5139 2018-05-21 14:53:07 You could always make your own growth oil that smells good. Look up SunKissAlba growth oil on YouTube. I use it and I’m a natural hair OG lol

5143 2018-05-21 14:52:57 Media Matters is little but a troll swarm. There are a few good people commenting there, and they get silenced by the flood of idiocy.
5144 2018-05-21 14:52:57 It's just astounding, any sanctions now will never be as strong as the ones that forced them to accept the Iran Deal. Likely far far weaker too, hell even the US is still buying Iranian *oil* for 180 days.
5145 2018-05-21 14:52:57 Last two. The petrodollars weren't redistributed through the IFI's to the countries hit hardest by higher oil prices but rather invested in US Treasuries (David E. Spiro); and oil now had one global price (Cyrus Bina).
5146 2018-05-21 14:52:56 Chart proves nothing.  I said Min wage was a part of increases but not all, (not to mention massive job losses) but rising cost of oil was main part.  You claim was oil company just routine price gouging.
5147 2018-05-21 14:52:54 The price of oil is rising. High risk ideas are about to come about and it’s not going to be a great thing for this planet.
5148 2018-05-21 14:52:54 CNN is on at my car dealership and Trump is speaking and PLEASE JESUS FINISH MY DAMN OIL CHANGE ALREADY.
5149 2018-05-21 14:52:53 And long term we must move to electrify vehicles where feasible. Indian economy does not have capacity to import oil for ever with rising prices.
5150 2018-05-21 14:52:48 Is Israel's deal with Genie gas and oil the reason why the US is involved in Syria look at their board of directors high-level American officials on board
5151 2018-05-21 14:52:48 #FuelPriceBomb If the Benefits of cheap oil could have transferred to the common man India would have achieved greater growth
5152 2018-05-21 14:52:47 Midnight oil will be burnt n depleted 
5153 2018-05-21 14:52:31 You conveniently leave out the international crude prices, which tripled between 2004 and 14, and which halved between 2014 and 15. Upa showed and impressive hdi growth, especially upa1; nda, despite the oil tax bonanza, is doing worse than even upa2.

5161 2018-05-21 14:51:51 Electric cars hv been here for long time,all the while being shitty enough. Developing lithium ion batteries does more damage to environment than fossil fuels. Ranges aren't much. Electric scooters came n failed.oil is the only option for vehicles.

5172 2018-05-21 14:51:01 is this relentless Oil bullish price action being backed with the fact that production in Venezuela is going down every single day?

5190 2018-05-21 14:49:58 China wants oil sales 2 go thru them. Yes they are building up in Africa & Asia. China & Russia have stated their goal to weaken the US petro $. Check treasury sales,rates. Having an effect. Now EU says it will or it is threatening 2 buy w euros (depends on which site u read)
5191 2018-05-21 14:49:45 I gotta get my car wash and an oil change this weekend. Mess around I may just get me a rental so I won’t have to deal with it
5192 2018-05-21 14:49:36 Only people  of India could not enjoy the benefits of cheap oil  because of the misrule of Modi

5196 2018-05-21 14:49:24 America has oil wells
5197 2018-05-21 14:49:22 Yo it's wild that we can literally harness energy from the sun every day for the next few billion years and we're still fighting wars and drilling into the ground for oil
5198 2018-05-21 14:49:21 What I do with my sesame oil is certainly not your business, sir.
5199 2018-05-21 14:49:20 Mr. President, China is the ONLY country that supplies goods to NK, oil on sea and supplies through non-stoping trains. They never stops supporting NK. How ridiculous you think CCP is helping you? CCP even provided all nuclear core to NK! Stop being an idiot! China is laughing!!!
5200 2018-05-21 14:49:19 Currency? Oil? NHS? Education? Police? Fracking? .....Debate done....still no!! 
5201 2018-05-21 14:49:12 you obviously don't remember the "Malaise" created by the "Opec Oil Crisis" when the "Last drop of oil on the planet" was about to be burned. the "Misery Index" it engendered..... during the CARTER admin
5202 2018-05-21 14:49:08 In UNSC on activities of @UNSMILibya, @franceonu urges "safeguarding" of the banking and oil production sectors of Libya in part to avoid success by those seeking to "pillage" the country.

5204 2018-05-21 14:49:02 Buster has alot of really bad seizures, plus he's 11. The meds they want him on have a ton of shitty side effects (my moms on em). My mom's boss reccommended a type of CBD oil specially formulated for dogs (her dog has em too). Now we just wait and see if its helping.
5205 2018-05-21 14:48:55 Oil pressure light came on in my car. Pulled over. I have no oil! WTF?

Waiting on someone to bring me some oil, then the car goes right into the shop.
5206 2018-05-21 14:48:53 Pompeo proclaimed toughest sanctions in history vs Iran.. As tough as German siege of Leningrad,41-44. Iran surrounded by friendly states, except  west bank of Persian Gulf. Iran controls & will control flow of oil from M.E. Geostrategically, Iran is very strong. Will not buckle.
5207 2018-05-21 14:48:45 Electric cars as we speak are coming up. How long do we crib about oil prices? As long as import dependance is there we can't do much, lower taxes will lead to fiscal blowup. Solution is to use taxes to build infra for EVs. Enough of pampering W Asian theocracies.

5211 2018-05-21 14:48:30 "An oil spill, for example, increases GDP because of the cost of cleaning it up.. This divergence.. is cruelly hidden in global statistics of rising GDP when powerful corporate and political interests destroy the lives of the vulnerable in the name of economic “progress.”

5216 2018-05-21 14:48:11 @Max_Fisher saying it was done "voluntarily" is a bit of a misnomer. The oil reductions were mutually agreed upon, but the threat of secondary sanctions under the 2012 NDAA was always there.
5217 2018-05-21 14:48:04 When a country has world's largest oil reserves how can American sanction cripple such country?

5227 2018-05-21 14:46:59 Wrong. Higher Oil taxes are because Modi guvt rightly found fiscal deficit unacceptably high. Fisc deficit and inflation today much lower than UPA2 levels.

5234 2018-05-21 14:46:28 Add to it that the only reason the "Iran deal" happened was because the EU was about to start trading with Iran regardless of US sanctions. What makes this clowns thinks the EU would turn away from cheap oil and start once again buying expensive Russian oil.

5239 2018-05-21 14:46:05 Did you know Iran wants to sell their oil in euros and not dollars that's why the us wants to attack Iran
5240 2018-05-21 14:45:57 then maybe the U.S. and it's allies should never have killed Saddam Hussein. If you bomb a country for control of its oil .........

5275 2018-05-21 14:42:57 The matter is not regime change. The main issue is a justification of a great war in M.E with a rich oil country like Iran for subsequent high petrodollars from cheap shell oil. Think well of it 
5276 2018-05-21 14:42:53 I love baby oil, but it’s ruining my life
5277 2018-05-21 14:42:53 Utter nonsense. We see you. The world sees what's going on in Latin/South America. You Yanks just can't keep yours hands off other peoples' oil. Why not just leave #Venezuela alone?
5278 2018-05-21 14:42:39 OPEC is looking closely at a drop in oil output from Venezuela to see if the loss of supply from the member state warrants action by the group, according to sources #OOTT

5283 2018-05-21 14:42:20 The guy who didn't start any wars.  Didn't get thousands of soldiers killed for oil.  That guy.
5284 2018-05-21 14:42:20 Oil prices are going up because Trump is paying back Putin and the Saudis for destroying our election process. Putin/Russia were suffering big from sanctions and low oil prices. Remember when Gingrich claimed Obama would let gas prices go beyond $5? That’s Trump.
5285 2018-05-21 14:42:20 Oil over you
5286 2018-05-21 14:42:14 Thank you. No, I was referring to the aromatic vs essential. Sometimes the essentials tend to fade quicker,but i greatly prefer them. I haven’t figured the exact amount of oil to drop into my humidifier per use. 

What brand of oils would you suggest?I get them from EBay. Thanks.
5287 2018-05-21 14:42:12 sir it is also true that our oil firms were in deep $hit and loss making, how do you recover that years of dolls for political reasons and stop wasting tax payer money?

5293 2018-05-21 14:41:19 If the goal was to "stop Iran from getting nukes" then the US would have had more success by staying in the Iran deal. Leaving the Iran deal guarantees Iran will restart their nuclear program.

*probably because stopping Iran from getting nukes was not really the goal

5299 2018-05-21 14:40:57 Glad that Trump's actions are forcing India away from Iran.

5301 2018-05-21 14:40:50 My take. Oil is a curse on nations. The rich get richer and the poor get persecuted until they rebell. And then the cycle starts again. Fortunately oils story is about to end. As we have discovered and invented new energy sources. But even there the corrupted rich are interfering

5316 2018-05-21 14:39:30 It is because Saudis enjoy impunity from US accountability.When you have a quarter of the world’s oil your influence will spread far&wide.Saudis are enjoying mutually beneficial relationship with America! Dare see anyone criticize them even after supplying the Wahabi bent Mullahs

5323 2018-05-21 14:38:57 @GovWike my governor, please Rivers State is back in agriculture and industries. The only industry we can really burst of are those in the oil sector. Oil will not continue for ever, we need to diversify ASAP. Roads are good, but we need industries and also equip our farmers.

5325 2018-05-21 14:38:51 World- What we need to figure out, if all the oil in Syria Golan Heights goes up in smoke, how much Carbon Dioxide/Monoxide will that place in the Earth's air. Fire from oils would burn for centuries to come. Whether it happens fast or slow by use, it is coming my friends. HELLO!
5326 2018-05-21 14:38:49 Agreed that the current crude oil prices are high resulting in high petrol and diesel rates.

Par jab all time low tha tab kaun sa tum ne fuel rates gira diye the.

5327 2018-05-21 14:38:33 Congress & JDS member doesn’t know the difference becoz they get free fuel, only v people know the pain and punch on fuel price hike. If these two party wants to win the heart of Karnataka people, let them look for direct import oil or consider 50% Subsidiary

5348 2018-05-21 14:36:16 Can’t wait for new tires and to fix this oil problem and get this bad boy back up and running like I want it to
5349 2018-05-21 14:36:00 Oil companies have nothing to do with recent prices.  Have you noticed WTO moved from $40 to $70 USD?  And CAD has fallen over the past 3-4 years.  Also, min wage hikes means high costs at retail, meaning higher prices for gas and diesel.
5350 2018-05-21 14:35:28 Trump turns blind eye toward Russia’s supplying N.Korea with technology and oil. #TrumpRussia

5379 2018-05-21 14:33:32 Exactly. Ironically Obama (remember, that socialist president) cut oil and gas subsidies and Trump just increased those same subsidies. So, I guess socialism is good?

5382 2018-05-21 14:33:25 and the global oil price is only $75.

During UPA 2009 SEP the global oil was at $78 while Indian petrol was rs.44 only. 

Fascism is squeezing us dry now.
5383 2018-05-21 14:33:25 Yeah sure and then Canada gets all the pollution from it, or whatever Canadian oil they’re going to go after! Simply can’t trust a Russian, there is always another reason they are doing something like this and their first reaction is “deny deny deny “

5402 2018-05-21 14:31:48 worth remembering that oil really is only like 13% of HYG now & that HYG is also picking up the rise in general rates (I know you know that).  HYG tracked oil for awhile simply b/c energy fell out of bed & rallied back but telecoms much larger now

Let's not ignore one point - when the current govt was in the opposition, every increase in fuel price made them more ruthless, even when they knew the crude oil prices were off the roof. Karma has come back to haunt them.
5413 2018-05-21 14:31:15 That's because there's more money in exports than in domestic sales.  Thank you Keystone XL for delivering oil to the Gulf of Mexico instead of leaving it trapped in The Dakotas and Canada...

5424 2018-05-21 14:30:17 Sir, this is not right. Crude oil per barrel in $ also important. This hike will seriously impact BJP. They should leave Fiscal deficit for a year and reduce excise duty

5429 2018-05-21 14:29:10 We made the cafeteria a total mess and we were supposed to clean it up today. One of the rules was no kind of oil and a kid started to pour some on the floor anyway so that was a big issue
5430 2018-05-21 14:28:46 She still isn't responsible for the recent hike in fuel prices. That's entirely the doing of oil companies. I'm not defending Wynne, but she's being incorrectly blamed for this recent rise in fuel prices, and people like Lorrie know better.
5431 2018-05-21 14:28:36 Its holding up particularly well but not when the CAD is priced in oil. Given 10-year correlational analysis of the CAD and oil prices show a 0.78 + relationship.

It looks like the bond market is having a time with that arb opp.

5459 2018-05-21 14:25:31 It's a foreign conspiracy to overthrow the BJP govt by intentionally increasing global crude oil prices...no other fathomable reason...what else can he possibly say.
5460 2018-05-21 14:25:28 I agree that the EU won't take Iran's side vs US and will probably end up complying with any US secondary sanctions. But I think it's unlikely the EU will reimpose the previous oil/gas sanctions and some of the financial and other pre-JCPOA ones unless Iran clearly pursues nukes.
5461 2018-05-21 14:25:19 Finding out nuttelex is made almost entirely from palm oil is just so depressing

5513 2018-05-21 14:20:21 I just spent $452.11 for 160 gallons of home heating oil. at $2.70 a gallon. Last year this time oil was under $2. Reporters need to check themselves before crowing about how "the economy" is doing fine. My heath insurance is up and gas is up and my pay is the same.

5517 2018-05-21 14:20:14 @SecPompeo so if Europe, Russia, China & others still get oil or trade w/ Iran what happens? Will we see them pulling diplomats and trade from USA?
5518 2018-05-21 14:20:12 Please compare it with crude oil prices to get the real difference.

5525 2018-05-21 14:19:45 You said Wynne isn't responsible for the price of fuel. She added 2 taxes that have caused the price to rise.and the hst is 8%, meaning if the oil companies raise gas, the amount of the tax increases. Cap and trade cost also rises yearly as a percentage. Try again.

5556 2018-05-21 14:17:03 Should president Trump put a freeze on oil prices so that big oil companies cannot take advantage of our situation involving Iran with the tough new sanctions?

5576 2018-05-21 14:14:28 So...I’m changing the oil on my CBR125R on Friday...just a few hours before I leave for Southampton to jump on a ferry to IOW...do you guys use a Torque Wrench on your sump plug or just hand tighten? As heard some horror stories and don’t fancy stripping the bolt before our trip.
5577 2018-05-21 14:14:19 Raw oil price increased.
5578 2018-05-21 14:14:19 Warning from Pakistan state Oil !!!Due to increase in temperature in the coming days, please don't fill petrol to the maximum limit. It may cause explosion in the fuel tank. Please fill the tank about half and allow space for air.

Sneaky bastards! Accident revealed it
5580 2018-05-21 14:14:03 We ALL walk around naked with cooking oil at some point.  But most of us are smart enough to only do so within the confines of our own home.   Bad form, Walking Around Naked With Cooking Oil In Public Guy, BAD FORM.   :(
5581 2018-05-21 14:14:02 Whereas oil is a blessing to a country, it can also be a curse unless that country is prepared to go by the rules of big and powerful nations who might want a stake in that resource....
5582 2018-05-21 14:14:01 Sure, but that's not floating. It remains the same, which means any hike in fuel the past while is because the oil companies have raised the price. The tax, btw, pays for road maintenance, among other things. Stop equating taxes with theft. It's silly.
5583 2018-05-21 14:13:59 Η Motor Oil ενισχύθηκε 2,07% και έκλεισε στα 18,74 ευρώ με όγκο 56 χιλ. τεμάχια και αποτίμηση 2,07 δισ. ευρώ
5584 2018-05-21 14:13:34 Getting out of Iraq agreement, cozying up to Putin, creating and unstable world. It's just Trump and Putin  conspiring to drive up oil prices to help the Russian economy and Rosneft.  This is proof.  We knew Trump was corrupt BEFORE we voted.  The rest of you got SUCKERED.

5592 2018-05-21 14:12:56 I'm just looking to see if you have any consistency here. Half of gun owners are women. Do they have a right to own the gun of their choice to protect their body or not?

5595 2018-05-21 14:12:36 Like the last time. OPEC got blamed even tho they were actually DROPPING the price of oil.. it's big business not OPEC.when Exxon artificially inflates oil prices then sells their own oil to themselves refines it at $100 a barrel & sells gas based on a fake price who's to blame?
5596 2018-05-21 14:12:29 It's what's turning many of us #NeverTrump conservatives to support him as his policies are good despite the man behind them. The progressives on social media and in the media itself are completely mental. They've even convinced Glenn Beck to Trump as well. Maximum irony.
5597 2018-05-21 14:12:15 oil prices too high so we bark at it and prices rise;
iran regime not preferred so we bark at it and their people will draw closer;
reverse psychology?
calculated tactics?
now is the time of bark, guess I need to adjust the strategy away from disagreement and towards navigation
5598 2018-05-21 14:12:05 Lovely paint job Nick, they look great. 
I really like your burgundy - would you care to share your recipe (is it screamer pink + nuln oil, with slaanesh grey as highlight?)
5599 2018-05-21 14:11:50 And interestingly, oil is one of the dominant items in India’s import bill. How will the govt manage to narrow trade deficit and fiscal deficit at this rate?

5615 2018-05-21 14:09:51 Drivers gearing up for trips this summer face escalating prices at the gasoline pump, an early sign that $70-a-barrel oil is starting to reach into consumers’ wallets.
5616 2018-05-21 14:09:48 The prices are artificially high Due to Russia & Saudi limiting production.There is such a glut of oil due to US fracking That the US is short of storage space.If Russia or Saudi pull out of their agreement Oil $20 to $40 a barrel.Bitumen costs about & $80. a barrel to mine

But it's interesting that you say that, as you want law abiding gun owners to give up their right to bear arms to an administration with someone you consider a tyrant. You support tyranny over freedom enough to give him control?

5650 2018-05-21 14:07:42 This is a Putin payback! Paid for by all of us. Trump couldn't get rid of sanctions as promised, but if he drives up the price per barrel of oil the sanctions don't have any effect.

5656 2018-05-21 14:07:04 The economy has been following the same trend for 8 years. Try supply and demand. Russia and Saudi Arabia decreased production to raise prices, China has been consuming like crazy, and some numbnuts pulled out of a nuclear agreement with an oil producing country.

5667 2018-05-21 14:06:30 A.S. brand Gingelly oil for mango pickle was Rs. 90/litre last season. It's Rs.260/litre. Does Fin. Minister live in India or their suppliers are subsidised? It's unreasonable for govt. to allow fuel prices go up constantly.

5669 2018-05-21 14:06:19 It was mind boggling to find out investments in green energy shift AWAY in favor of investments in fossil fuel when the price of oil goes up(I thought it had the opposite effect[common sense?].) But when Wall St manages our economy, what else can you expect?

5672 2018-05-21 14:06:03 Ethanol is being used all the time. Getting rid of ethanol is not going to help farmers or us. He's causing the price of oil to go up and that means the cost of gas will go up and that means we and farmers will pay MORE for gas & everything else as well.
5673 2018-05-21 14:06:02 This article lost me at ‘oil companies hurting’ (due to drop in oil prices)..
5674 2018-05-21 14:05:59 It doesn’t make sense for the Gov to bailout rather than creating jobs, even temporarily. It’s almost the same as steel industry, but at the end of the day— we make solid steal and the US pays for it. Keep the oil here, majority Canadians would gladly pay to keep it.

5692 2018-05-21 14:05:07 The "oil" called bitumen requires massive upgrading to meet the equivalent "oil" produced in the US.  This is why it is of less value.  If we upgraded all the oil, instead of shipping sludge oil, we could get more for it, and the diluent would not be needed

5695 2018-05-21 14:04:55 Oh, I see. Addiction to oil isn't a problem because we have racism to keep our minds off it. I wish you luck in all your future endeavors.
5696 2018-05-21 14:04:48 OPEC showed that globalization had arrived: post colonial states would now insist on there being 1 global price for a barrel of oil instead of the oil companies extracting resources below value. What came next depended on specification that Keynesianism & intervention had failed

5702 2018-05-21 14:04:18 @Swamy39 why petrol prices are not coming down instead of low crude oil rates. I lost in a debate with secular idiots today.

5746 2018-05-21 14:00:18 CBD is a little different than hemp oil. CBD/THC come from the leaves, stems, and buds of the plant. Hemp oil comes from the seeds. A 80/20 or 90/10 ratio of CBD/THC is optimal for anxiety.
5747 2018-05-21 14:00:14 What happened in Venezuela is more the old story of  developing country depending on high oil price, vastly overspending & no plan B if price crashes then reverting to authoritarian means to keep control. See every developing country that had oil for other historical examples
5748 2018-05-21 14:00:12 What .... U r theory of bikes n trucks don't make sense, it's abt the world price index n the govt n lower crude oil is still selling at a higher rate, where the tax amount is half the cost....
5749 2018-05-21 14:00:06 Why don't they appeal Donald Trump to reduce crude oil prices.also they can appeal to middle East countries to reduce price. Kuch bhi bolte hai log. Hume itna bewkuff samjha ki vote Lene ke Baad Kuch bhi bolenge n karenge
5750 2018-05-21 14:00:01 Really, because they also placed enormous purchases from Russia and Europe while turning to Iran for cheap oil. If the deal isn't signed, then its not a deal. China is establishing new trade partners while talking to you, expect them to back out of whatever you think you've got.

5754 2018-05-21 13:59:29 As u know, international crude oil price is very high. Refining, production, distribution cost comes extra on this. Thus it comes high. Then comes the tax. Will a government say no to tax. U hiked alcohol tax 300% in Kerala. What about that? Central government has a decent tax

5763 2018-05-21 13:59:01 I don't understand this outrage on Oil price hike in India. With rising crude prices, Petrol/Diesel costs upto 1.6 Euro in Europe, comes to around Rs.150/Ltr
Ofcourse, Refinery to Logistic costs less in India, but retail cost seem reasonable.

5800 2018-05-21 13:55:20 Higher oil prices can absolutely mean a strong international economy. Strong demand worldwide and growing infrastructure in emerging markets can lead to higher oil prices

5834 2018-05-21 13:51:33 ...and they’ll have unlimited fuel resources to power their surge.

Because they are focusing on renewables. 

While we’re focusing on... coal. And oil.
How very retarded we are.

Thank you
5871 2018-05-21 13:48:32 Prices have been trending higher for the past 2 months. They jump up, come down slightly then jump higher. If I didn't know better I'd say there's someone somewhere with an agenda. I think it's a combination of things (holiday, oil prices, etc.)

5874 2018-05-21 13:48:13 Why aren't you building refineries, not only for the job value, but also so that we can refine our OWN oil and use it here at home? We could be totally self sufficient in our energy production if we rebuilt all the refineries that were closed or left to rot under Obama.

5899 2018-05-21 13:45:27 It’s easily convincing that present govt. has not increased the prices like the earlier govt. did, however, present govt. can certainly partially roll back taxes it raised few years back when crude oil was quite cheaply available. States can also reduce local taxes thereafter.
5900 2018-05-21 13:45:09 As if the US didn't help create those groups?

5916 2018-05-21 13:43:00 That’s interesting... Russia & Nam have a historically good relationship back during Cold War.
But China buys 1.34 MBPD of oil from Russia.
But transporting 734 KBPD those oil is impossible without going through Japanese alliance territory.

5958 2018-05-21 13:38:50 Unfortunately, my body cannot tolerate any soy in food or body products so I always have to read labels carefully because so many contain soya bean oil or soy lecithin. Even chocolate! Took a long time to figure out what was causing my body to react because it’s in a lot of stuff
5959 2018-05-21 13:38:39 Thanks man! Ill give that a shot and see how well it works. I have beard oil that i use and coconut oil for when it gets real bad. I've heard going no shampoo is a good way to go so hopefully that works. Ive been aiming for more natural cleansers so its good to hear they do good!
5960 2018-05-21 13:38:36  YASSSS!!!
5961 2018-05-21 13:38:30 What's the oil price now!
5962 2018-05-21 13:38:20 Oil price at 100 a barrel by December 
5963 2018-05-21 13:38:12 He is a snake oil salesman.
5964 2018-05-21 13:38:08 Did you really went to IIT? Dollar price is increasing due to NPA Accounts and I don't need to give big explanation here in small space. Regarding crude oil it's cheaper compare to previous year. U can compare it on Google, it shall help U more. Stop being so ignorant frm facts
5965 2018-05-21 13:38:01 Most economic indicators lag, so the true impact of policies are not felt for months sometimes years after they are put in place. Oil and food prices are pretty much real time. Don’t forget what was done to hide the toxic “assets” just 10-years ago. Don’t be fooled.
5966 2018-05-21 13:37:55 Just about the same in MA .  So glad Frump made his billionaire oil exec pals happy.
5967 2018-05-21 13:37:54 There is a war coming. 
Iran will want to assert itself.
USA will offer evidence of nuclear activities for WMD having been restarted. 
The ships will move in.
War starts, oil goes up.
Aramco will get a premium listing.
War is coming.
 Money.
5968 2018-05-21 13:37:49 I think it’s cool to be you and everything but there should be some sort of standard on how y’all carry yourself and personal appearance at work. I went to get my oil changed Saturday and the guy had half his hair twisted and the other half looked like he got electrocuted

5973 2018-05-21 13:36:58 Iran Zarith- please have a accountant keep record of payments made, due dates & deliquencies on USA account... Charge interest on unpaid balance.  Eventually USA must pay its bill... That is because you got the oil!!!
5974 2018-05-21 13:36:58 Getting pretty homesick. Read an article about an oil tanker  filled with 90 million dollars worth of liquid meth being pulled over in North Carolina and all I could think was, I bet it would cost 120 million in New York.
5975 2018-05-21 13:36:57 Sir UPA के समय में तेल कंपनियों को भारी-भरकम subsidy भी दी जाती थी!
     अब आप यह खुद बताएं कि NDA सरकार अभी तेल कंपनियों को कितनी subsidy दे रही है?  तब आप खुद समझ जाएंगे कि cruide oil के सस्ते होने पर भी petrol इतना महंगा क्यों है...
5976 2018-05-21 13:36:48 Kept oil prices down. That's why gas prices have skyrocketed recently.
5977 2018-05-21 13:36:46 Kevin has basically said that you must look at the bigger picture of History, domestic and international politics.

But you are right in one thing: Venezuela has a problem with dependence of oil which dates back to the 4th Republic of Venezuela.
5978 2018-05-21 13:36:42 So in other words, she right. Move along if insults are all you're going to contribute.
5979 2018-05-21 13:36:35 Gonna clean my car out and get a oil change & start back doing lyft and Instacart

5981 2018-05-21 13:36:29 Lol. When you only think about crude oil without thinking of your relevance in the palm oil industry. That's being ignorant. Ignoramus

5986 2018-05-21 13:36:12 Huge oil reserves
5987 2018-05-21 13:36:11 the EU could sanction the US, hurting the companies and Trump voters that enable, support this mess. Koch industries, Adelson’s gambling business, AT&T, farming, coal, oil, steel
5988 2018-05-21 13:36:07 Anybody oil pull ?
5989 2018-05-21 13:36:04 “I don’t want to intensify rumours because they will always be there, and when you respond to rumours it’s like pouring oil onto a fire.

Mokwena explained that the only approaches have been “whistles”, before emphasising that the temptation does not appeal to him.
5990 2018-05-21 13:36:04 Iran didn't threaten the American people before and does not do it now. The attack on the World Trade Center was not made by Iran.
Of the 19 terrorists, 15 were citizens of Saudi Arabia, 2 from UAE, 1 from Egypt, and 1 from Lebanon.
The US wants to steal Iran's oil again?
5991 2018-05-21 13:36:03 The price of oil is set on a global scale cutting to shreds the argument any and all drilling will reduce the price to consumers.  Want to save resources? Consider the damaging effects of fossil fuels as the DOD has stated climate change is one of the biggest risks they face.
5992 2018-05-21 13:35:58 Are you? You make claims. Either support them with linked facts to contribute to the debate, or move on.
5993 2018-05-21 13:35:50 Castor oil helps with almost everything. I'm using it to strengthen the roots. I'm trying anything that might work ... these nails are frustrating
5994 2018-05-21 13:35:46 Another one bites the dust.

They jump in, realize they are in over their heads, then run away... 
5995 2018-05-21 13:35:30 Hahaha!
5996 2018-05-21 13:35:30 Actually @JKempEnergy is a good oil follow he sends out emails on everything energy and it’s quite good.
5997 2018-05-21 13:35:26 Your English Pound is going to be worthless without Scottish Oil and other resources to underpin it. Why does it matter what other currency we use?
5998 2018-05-21 13:35:18 It is an opinion piece, contributed by a non-staffer. But yes, too bad the piece fails to properly support his (correct) thesis: tar sands oil is really expensive and it will be one of the first sources to fail. Maybe it already is....

6003 2018-05-21 13:34:57 Higher oil prices are now good for the American economy (according to economists). May need to catch up with this talking point now that we are in 2018 and America is energy independent!

6006 2018-05-21 13:34:47 #US, Europe on collision path in #Iran. “Strongest sanctions in history” promised a day after EU energy commissioner in Tehran says Europe to keep buying Iranian oil.
6007 2018-05-21 13:34:46 #LEK looking great ! will follow what #GKP has done in last couple weeks on share price. a great stock to hold with oil recovery
6008 2018-05-21 13:34:39 That's making a wild assumption that oil companies would not just pocket the difference. They already price fix in the GTA, gouging us with artificially high prices.
6009 2018-05-21 13:34:33 Midfield is full, full backs full everywhere. Plus I guess the coach would have thought cos of his age he'll still get other chances to play at the World Cup
6010 2018-05-21 13:34:29 Why is it 10 or 15 years ago when oil was around $49/barrel, gas was $.49/l. Now oil has hovered around that same price, yet we pay almost 3 times the price per litre. We are being taxed to death.
6011 2018-05-21 13:34:26 War has alreadybeen declared inS.A. but only against the white population,see how many whites has been killed by blacks since they took over in1994. Oil your guns and start defending yourselfs and your property. The time is now.
6012 2018-05-21 13:34:24 The NRA is a non profit org.. Maybe you shouldn't be one yourself. There are no facts to confirm your claims. Gun manufacturers have their own representatives, and they don't need to use the NRA.

6015 2018-05-21 13:34:04 Of course and Russian oil companies ...
6016 2018-05-21 13:33:56 @POTUS 

Why is the Mexican Government owned oil company Pemex allowed to operate gas stations in this country?
6017 2018-05-21 13:33:54 I’m ruthless with the block function.
Me: “Promoting Miracle Whip as mayonnaise? I think NOT! Banished.”

I’m indiscriminate, with the exception of Breyer’s, who I troll ruthlessly b/c you can’t just go around advertising palm oil fakery as ‘ice cream’. It’s immoral.
6018 2018-05-21 13:33:52 The amount of times I get asked if I'm Mediterranean out here is unreal , carrot oil is working wonders

YOU HAVE BEEN POTUS FOR OVER A YEAR!
You said it all would be

You are destroying our environment, rolling back safeguards for workers, oil prices gone up, gun deaths rising, breaking emoluments law.
6020 2018-05-21 13:33:44 Note to self... never have pork sliders, iced coffee and cheese cake AND go in a pool... holy shit... almost made an oil slick in there...
6021 2018-05-21 13:33:39  I swear by Oil of Olay! I know it sounds all grandma but every tine I asked an old woman that looked really good what she used, she said Oil of Olay. I also use Ponds at night for extra moisture. The trick: moisturize, MOISTURIZE,MOISTURIZE! 
6022 2018-05-21 13:33:38 Fracking oil finance logic - "Parsley Energy Inc spent almost $2 for every $1 it made in cash" according to WSJ. During that same time period the stock price went up quite a bit. Borrowing money to lose money is rewarded by increased stock price. Ponzi?
6023 2018-05-21 13:33:37 Oil and plastic are organic, according to chemists.
6024 2018-05-21 13:33:35 That would be me! But it was an essential oil burner with tea lights. It was all a bit much for Kirsty.
6025 2018-05-21 13:33:33 It costs a lot more have you seen the prices at the pump. All of our groceries have to be brought to the store via truck using fuel. It's not the first time Republicans have gone to war in the Middle East to increase sales of us oil. We charge too much.
6026 2018-05-21 13:33:27 Like a burning dump truck driving through an oil refinery
6027 2018-05-21 13:33:19 Um, all your stats are wrong, and Europe is a shithole of rape, sex gangs, carbombs, and no personal freedom. The "study" you are trying to cite was published by the U.N., an organization that we know is actively anti-American, and corrupt. None of us have forgot oil for food.
6028 2018-05-21 13:33:12 Crude prices are for 1 barrel and not 1 ltr.
Since many products can be made from crude oil.... It's approx 45 ltr of Petrol made from a barrel. The cost includes transport, refining, local transport and various taxes. So its not $77 sold in Rs. 77.
6029 2018-05-21 13:33:10 Pride company  refined oil
6030 2018-05-21 13:33:04 @realDonaldTrump so what is going on with gas? Oil by the barrel down but pump at price back up! So the American people are hostages to the oil companies now. Your economy is booming but doesn’t me we should be gouged for making money.

6043 2018-05-21 13:31:55 I have never seen such stupid explanation to justify price-rise in crude oil. Just to support Modi they are Showing non-sense, Where is the rate of Crude oil?,
6044 2018-05-21 13:31:51 I need to remember to get an oil change this week. Lord knows this car has done it's part to over 240k miles. Just gotta hold on another 6 months... or so.
6045 2018-05-21 13:31:50 Because Venezuela is still part of OPEC, they're still have to under-produce in order not to break quotas imposed by the cartel.

$78 per barrel is a lot better than what is was when the initial oil glut occurred in 2014.
6046 2018-05-21 13:31:40 No but you can check the palm oil industry

6095 2018-05-21 13:27:14 Ohhh man, you continue to use care. Is some of that recyclable, to make, some of the oil/diesel fuel
6096 2018-05-21 13:27:08 That’s all they do.
6097 2018-05-21 13:27:08 I worked at a school in Abu Dhabi that was 9 kilometres from the Saudi border. They're all cousins. And the cousins have oil.
6098 2018-05-21 13:27:02 Kenya busy fighting oil spill after 3,000 litres of fuel from a Kenya Railways train derailed at Kibarani cutting off Mombasa Island from the mainland. Focus is to prevent the spill from getting into the ocean @AfricaLive5
6099 2018-05-21 13:27:02 And who will supply India's oil, if not the "common enemy"? Or do we go back to the age of horses and bull-carts?
6100 2018-05-21 13:26:56 Goan get BAM OIL   
6101 2018-05-21 13:26:48 Came to my oil change appointment 30 minutes early and the employee literally scoffed at me when I said I was early. I’m sorry not enough people do that so it turns into an inconvenience. Dick.
6102 2018-05-21 13:26:42 Marine gas has oil in it. Yes it gets into the habit of wildlife.

6106 2018-05-21 13:26:25 I am pretty sure @SecPompeo did not include China or India in the list of countries invited to pressure #Iran post-#JCPOA.  Realistic, since they won't.  Absurd, since their oil purchases are key to any pressure.

6110 2018-05-21 13:26:10 Welp, there go your pay raises. The place was on a pay freeze for the four years I worked there and they were some of the best times for oil.
6111 2018-05-21 13:26:00 Oil change turned into $400 worth of work. It’s for the better though.. I should be happy 
6112 2018-05-21 13:25:58 This was all designed to lead us to war so that it could fulfill @POTUS "I think we should go in there and grab the oil."  He now has Pompeo and Bolton backing him on this. . .
6113 2018-05-21 13:25:54 Cause our government isn't having it they would rather take money from oil and coal companies.
6114 2018-05-21 13:25:51 how much coconut oil is too much to put on a fresh tattoo?
6115 2018-05-21 13:25:48 1. 85% of India's annual Oil need of 220MT is imported .
2. Oil cesses of all types give guvts 5-7L crore Rs p.a
3. Despite 2, state+cent Guvts hv combined deficit > 5% GDP

Preventive checks minimise the risk of a breakdown in a dangerous location.

6124 2018-05-21 13:24:58 Don’t forget, Russia’s economy begins to thrive when crude oil prices hover around $70/per barrel.  It’s advantageous to us to develop alternative energy sources and keep crude oil prices down. Our current energy policies only help a country that wants to destroy our way of life.
6125 2018-05-21 13:24:50 It’s only going one way unfortunately. Oil Just hit $80 a barrel, the highest in 4 years. All the unrest in the Middle East and Iran....predictions are $100 by end of the year! Fill up quick!

6144 2018-05-21 13:23:04 The US, the biggest war mongering nation on Earth. We want your oil and we are going to get it, legally or illegally. False flags are their watchword.

6148 2018-05-21 13:22:25 Neither my husband are middle class earners and neither expect a tax cut at all. Meanwhile, the cost of our healthcare is skyrocketing while oil and gas prices are up about 50%. So we're definitely worse off.

6165 2018-05-21 13:21:25 Indian Rupee ended weaker today on worries of higher oil prices and tracking losses in Asian currencies. Higher US bond yields also dampened the sentiment. The Rupee ended at 68.12 vs. Friday’s close of 68.01.

6172 2018-05-21 13:21:02 Higher crude oil prices and weaker Rupee also impacted sentiment. Barring IT, oil & gas and technology  stocks, all sectors on BSE finished in the red, with BSE Realty falling  over 3%.  Sensex and Nifty ended 0.67% and 0.75% lower respectively.
6173 2018-05-21 13:21:01 Tim... yes.  I have been writing about the Shale Ponzi since 2013.  However, it's always good to back it up with data.  U.S. Shale oil & gas production will experience a SENECA CLIFF like decline over the next 2-4 years.
6174 2018-05-21 13:20:51  idk bruh. You gotta Mercedes so she might be a lil hesitant bout the price  RT @Womb_Beater_69: Lemme know when you send it to her so I can go get my oil changed
6175 2018-05-21 13:20:50 Thank you Mr. President! Now lets get all grain production for consumption and not driving. We have oil for that.
6176 2018-05-21 13:20:44 We (the provinces) do not control equalization payments. It is part of the federal redistribution of income tax revenues throughout the country based upon economic and social needs. #ableg #cdnpoli As far as shutting down oil, if we lose another customer, how does it effect us?

6188 2018-05-21 13:18:49 Yes, shale energy production (gas & oil) will likely experience a SENECA CLIFF like decline over the next 2-4 years.  With collapsing production of fossil fuels, ramping up renewable energy will be nearly impossible.

6191 2018-05-21 13:18:24 Why is the price of gas increasing while at the same time the US is pumping more oil ?
6192 2018-05-21 13:18:23 Why are gas prices so high if we are selling oil to other countries
6193 2018-05-21 13:18:08 The pro-corporate greed bunch and federal Liberals will just keep blaming it on BC so they can bailout an American oil co with Cdn tax$s.

6206 2018-05-21 13:16:42 A big part of why our gas price is high is that our dollar is low. Our dollar is low because we can't get product to market  (oil).

President Trump's decision to withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal helped push the energy sector higher.  With renewed sanctions on the horizon, the anticipation of a pullback from global oil supplies boosted prices.

6251 2018-05-21 13:13:06 Agreed.  Thatcher did a spectacular job of convincing people otherwise though. The short-term carrots of low taxes thanks to North Sea Oil and the sale of council houses. Norway invested, by contrast, and are in a much healthier state all round.

6254 2018-05-21 13:12:47 The intro gives you all the facts; have to come off oil & gas. Who pays the €700m fine a year for not hitting sustainable targets that most of other countries have hit? That's bigger per home than water charges. Good luck trying to get that past homes that want sustainability

6303 2018-05-21 13:08:04 @realDonaldTrump Ive been doing research regarding the next economic crash and its inevitable. We have an inflated ecomony from just printing money. Why not get rid of the Federal Reserve and go back to coining our own money again? Back our money with gold or oil.

6327 2018-05-21 13:05:07 I believe they can get away with that due to state income from oil. I would guess that most states couldn't do that.
6328 2018-05-21 13:05:00 The root cause of the problem was OPEC decided to create a oil glut to combat US shale oil.

6338 2018-05-21 13:03:57 #Slashoiltax Both Central and State governments are addicted to oil tax revenues. With over 100% total tax, impact of price rise is doubled on consumer. Impose a fixed tax amount which will ensure govt's income but lessen as a percentage of total cost as the prices increase.

6382 2018-05-21 12:56:53 Chavez flouted international law by ‘nationalising’ oil fields & concessions from companies who they had invited to develop the industry and took large sums in payment. The industry which could have provided wealth for the people if handled correctly is now in terminal decline.

6384 2018-05-21 12:56:46 The sharp fall in the pound versus the dollar over the last month is probably a factor. This is nothing to do with Brexit. The Euro has fallen about the same against the dollar. But it's bad news when the (dollar-based) priced oil is climbing to multi-year highs.

6391 2018-05-21 12:55:48 North Sea oil has 10yrs left
6392 2018-05-21 12:55:45 That happened under Bush too. Then they increased spending, oil prices, inflation and war. And in a matter of a couple years we had the GREAT RECESSION. It happens under EVERY Republican president since Nixon. Its happening now as we speak.
6393 2018-05-21 12:55:42 4sure.

6399 2018-05-21 12:54:56 You cannot sell strategic national wealth to foreign companies outright. It might not be good for US companies. But nothing wrong in it. Mexico could use oil to counter absurd NAFTA demands like how China did with US import of agro products and now trade war is halted.
6400 2018-05-21 12:54:50 Yes, & once sanctions lifted, Iran shipped the oil - their ships were loaded & waiting to go.  China was buying high % of it & according to news is now agreeing to buy from US on trade deal.  I may be wrong on this.
6401 2018-05-21 12:54:50 Corrupt Emirates used dirty oil money to buy the French league. And they talk about scandals.
6402 2018-05-21 12:54:47 Hope you people have asked anything related to the oil price as well in that press conference.
6403 2018-05-21 12:54:47 Since I have been taking evening primrose  oil and vitamin B6 I haven't had no anxiety at all and it's totally amazing

6410 2018-05-21 12:53:43 The reason is to destabilize the oil market, so Russia (Putin) makes more money
6411 2018-05-21 12:53:39 Most of the more recent oil prospects are in England or the Irish Sea, a lot of the North Sea oilfields have gone.
6412 2018-05-21 12:53:35 *sigh* Where do I start?

First of all, we're running a fixed exchange rate system, so the value of the Naira is not deteemined by market forces but by the CBN.

It would be unwise for CBN to revalue the Naira at a stronger rate than what it is once oil prices hit $100...
6413 2018-05-21 12:53:28 The divide is no longer left-right as they would have you believe, it is now union-independence. For both tory parties Scotland is collateral as long as together they can prevent independence. Everybody knows england is shafted without oil and whisky and water.

6415 2018-05-21 12:53:20 Me too, and all I did was ask him to flesh out "common sense."
6416 2018-05-21 12:53:14 Barrels of oil are low, yet gallons of gas are high. Somebody's playing us, America.
6417 2018-05-21 12:53:11 Your tweets are the ravings of a crafty madman. Your transparent attempt of misdirection is working with your base, but most Americans are not buying your shark  skin suit.

6422 2018-05-21 12:52:14 Oil prices in international market r decided by OPEC,not Saudi Arab wch is only one member of this body like many other as Iran,Iraq,Kuwait etc who do regular meetings n decide da price n reduce da oil production if prices r low,so our oil minister is either a fool r fooling arnd
6423 2018-05-21 12:52:06 How do you, not just use the same oil to fry every friable stuff in your house but, use it over and over for over 3 months? 
6424 2018-05-21 12:51:27 Yip that too. Essentially Scotland can be independently viable just not with the same values as UK. Tbh Scotland wanted to create a sovereign wealth fund with the oil revenue. Westminster stole it to prop up crap government

6449 2018-05-21 12:48:10 I do agree with you.  Once Teheran stops paying Hamas, it's over.  I think 1 reason Trump pulled out of Iran deal - stop the oil export & that's Iran's Monies.

6454 2018-05-21 12:47:49 Olive or avocado. It’s the healthiest and works incredibly well! Coconut oil is another healthy option that works, but some brands have a REALLY strong coconut flavor...but if you love coco-nutty food then that’s a great choice!(I personally don’t don’t coconut flavored eggs;)

6486 2018-05-21 12:45:08 And to be honest, Saudi Arabia was involved as well as Israel. Saudi and Russia have been losing trillions over President Obama's world oil policies, now prices are way up over Iran and Israel. Israel was being made to fend for themselves and start peace initiatives.
6487 2018-05-21 12:45:04 There's more going on in crude fundamentals than just geopolitics... oil demand is setup to significantly outpace supply in the medium & long term. A healthy pullback is expected, but I think we'll see $100 oil in the next 12 mo's sans recession.

6497 2018-05-21 12:43:37 That's because your glorious party have shut down the industry's that we could have had and squandered all the oil money on wars and vanity projects for the South
6498 2018-05-21 12:43:33 Pretty sure it will be for the same reasons as new cars, oil has got better, and companies are increasingly aware of the environmental footprint of their vehicles. ie the less often the oil requires changing the less waste oil it produces
6499 2018-05-21 12:43:10 I love the morons trying to troll President Trump.  It's like a used car salesman trying to sell oil to a sheikh, or Luke Skywalker teaching Yoda to use the force, or a 2nd grader trying to teach Babe Ruth how to hit a homerun. None of your posts will be remembered, but Trump's?

6501 2018-05-21 12:42:59 @seanhannity Sean since you do talk with our President I think its time for you to ask our President to stop all this  other crap and focus on our gas/oil prices Just in case you/he havent noticed they are going sky high  I know you have the bucks to shell out, but 99% of us dont

6505 2018-05-21 12:42:06 Wait til you’re paying the oil/gas bill and you realize how much heat is lost via non-carpeted floors. Although, let’s all be glad the energy-saving drop ceilings of the 70’s are over.

6517 2018-05-21 12:41:08 If Vancouver wants lower gas prices in the near future , they have three options: build a $10B refinery and bring oil tankers from somewhere; or build a pipeline to WA state to access their supply; or expand #TMX to access supply in Alberta.
6518 2018-05-21 12:41:05 @narendramodi govt. looted exorbitant tax for 4 years when prices of oil was below $60. One of the biggest scams in History. Public continued paying the tax when oil prices was $108. @RahulGandhi @PChidambaram_IN are busy pointing other funny issues leaving this big one out.

6616 2018-05-21 12:29:14 OPEC set their production which set the price. Saudis were part of that agreement. Russia, who gets 83% of their revenue from oil, needed two things - higher price per barrel and removal of sanctions that limited their crude oil sales.  Vlad pleases with Trump.

6622 2018-05-21 12:28:27 Petrol and Diesel prices will only grow from now on. Peak oil crisis is setting in. There is going to be no easy solution to this. Even Modi cannot do his magic in this regard, sadly (for him). So people, stop complaining, check your usage and swallow this #PetrolPrice
6623 2018-05-21 12:28:20 I got hot oil in my eye  and when I told my mother, she laughed hysterically at me. WTF!!!
6624 2018-05-21 12:27:59 Umm, eggs? Should I come over with flour and oil?
6625 2018-05-21 12:27:56 Yep
6626 2018-05-21 12:27:55 City had oil money tho, but afaik (may be wrong on this) Utd never had a sugar daddy pumping funds into the club so I thought Utd was more apt
6627 2018-05-21 12:27:50 Could you give the figures of crude oil as well. It will give some sense rather than just judging on this one stat.
6628 2018-05-21 12:27:39 i really need somebody to go get my oil changed for me , not pay for it just take my car ... wasn’t shit open yesterday & that was my only off day 
6629 2018-05-21 12:27:32 there is literally a thin layer of oil on top of the ocean... STOP POLLUTING OUR OCEAN!
6630 2018-05-21 12:27:21 when UPA was in power, it was govt who decided the rates of petrol and diesel.when UPA is going to end, they gave the power to oil companies to decide on rates. Will you say NO? ..who cancelled diesel subsidy?  UPA or NDA? Will you answer? dmk r congress ok to bring it under GST?
6631 2018-05-21 12:26:57 Is Major Move Coming For North European Oil Royalty Trust (NRT) After This Double Top Chart Patter...
6632 2018-05-21 12:26:37 It's an example of what happens when the most oil rich country in Latin America, is taken over by a bunch of incompetent Left wing crooks. Compare it with Chile, far poorer in terms of natural resources, but infinitely richer and more successful thanks to capitalism.
6633 2018-05-21 12:26:32 Good tally
Pls share Y2Y crude oil price also
And UPA payment arears also

6639 2018-05-21 12:26:05 I work a fry shift today and I can PROMISE you that I will throw scalding oil on whichever manager decides to act cute and put me on drive-thru...

6641 2018-05-21 12:26:02 Sir . That’s because US has abundant oil fields (Read about Alaska) . They also have tactical understanding with Middle East and hence gets Oil at very discounted rate (Read about Iraq invasion and Weapon of Mass destruction) :-)
6642 2018-05-21 12:26:00 We have oil of wintergreen that we get from the pharmacy. The intended use is to mask unpleasant odors.
6643 2018-05-21 12:25:49 Increasing oil prices is nothing but a result of the combination of rupees falling before dollar and the centre's decision to halt daily revision of fuel prices.... So it's nothing like the Modi govt hasn't foreseen it...!

6646 2018-05-21 12:25:32 Very sensible. I think I have a service/oil change reset tool for that, if you ever need it. You can just do it with a bit of wire, though. Dad used to have an E32, always missed it. Real sharp bit of kit.
6647 2018-05-21 12:25:29 I distinctly remember that promise...in his snake oil salesman voice..
6648 2018-05-21 12:25:26 No you can’t ask because he will not speak truth. These guys only divert people from real issues. It’s time to ask about oil hike/
6649 2018-05-21 12:24:59 Wow. Corruption on face. Rahul Gandhi is right then “Modi is corruption.” If this happens then let’s buy MPs form each other and form the government. Just a question Mr. Amit Shah when are you planning to reduces oil prices? Hope you know who Aam Aadmi are!

6653 2018-05-21 12:24:32 Yes. Peppermint oil is an essential oil that’s volatile and can even burn the skin. Wouldn’t recommend at all to spot treat.

6657 2018-05-21 12:24:14 This a great argument for nationalizing oil and gas production to control prices and remove market influence and corporate profit-taking.
6658 2018-05-21 12:24:13 @WhiteHouse @PressSec 2) Callers are right : #OPEC S.Arabia/Gulf cutting supplies to push barrel of Oil to $90-100 levels in summer season is a stab in the back after all US has done for them & neocon Middle East Hedge Funds & Fossil Fuels speculators, what a pack of traitors!
6659 2018-05-21 12:24:10 You always sound just like a man running scared. Blaming anyone and everything on the mess you've created and manipulated and conned folks into. You are nothing more than an old fashion snake oil salesman but with lies that are far more serious and damaging.

6666 2018-05-21 12:23:21 Wrong! How many millions in subsidies does oil and gas get?
6667 2018-05-21 12:23:16 All environmental problems are problems, and we do not want a "problem hype cycle of the year", with campaigns unfinished. Stop the problems at source: stop extracting oil from ground. What happened to Zero Emissions cities, the blocking of ICE engine vehicles from cities?

6682 2018-05-21 12:20:36 For clarity, the oil needs to get to a refinery to be refined, not a port. And the existence of the kayaks already would seem to suggest that’s not currently an issue. They don’t want the pipeline expansion. They don’t want the risk of it failing.

6693 2018-05-21 12:19:52 Rising fuel price should be controlled, as it is affecting our economy badly, the first step to success for any government is to make the robust plan of how the international price hike on crude oil can be managed while dealing with OPEC and domestic customers in India.

Be aware and thankful for what you have and He will use it.

6768 2018-05-21 12:11:59 But OPEC nations don't sell Oil cheap to India just because we are a poor nation.
So understand that so long as we import 85% of Oil, this problem will persist some way or other .

6770 2018-05-21 12:11:49 Yep....I think that was part of Trump's meeting with the Saudi Prince--to encourage him to raise his cheap prices gradually to help the oil donors.  There's no shame in this administration.  It didn't take long for price to start rising after that sword dancing with liar Trump.

6807 2018-05-21 12:07:30 Absurd logic!  Fuel prices are directly proportionate to Crude Oil prices.  The question is why they managed to keep at that level despite the per barrel price was more than USD 100 and why can't this govt?

6822 2018-05-21 12:05:31 GDP grows by 1.95%
This is the 4th consecutive positive growth subsequent to the recession

However, if you compare it quarter on quarter, it's a dip from the 2.11% growth in 2017 Q4.

Also this growth is driven by increase in oil production and prices.

Chavas impoverished PDVSA

Purged management who were not Socialists

& then starved it of investment

PDVSA was used as a cash cow.

But the money ran out.

6829 2018-05-21 12:04:27 Aren't taxes the source for development funds? Central and state govts. getting more money is surely better than tax money being used to fund oil marketing companies. So long as it doesn't hurt inflation targets, they should continue and use it for growth.

6836 2018-05-21 12:03:25 And besides, the sanctions haven't imposed any ban on the country's oil exports so are incredibly small fry in comparison to the bigger picture here.

6875 2018-05-21 11:59:16 Greater Somalia is going to be seen in the same way as the third Reich by the media. They can’t allow an unified Somalia because that’ll mean the 7th biggest oil nation could go against the world power structure. They don’t want a powerful true Muslim nation in Africa at all.

6891 2018-05-21 11:57:28 Why don't u get experts instead of the same ..same politician palenist ...they don't know the subject..but definitely know how to play the blame game....does anyone know how does the international crude oil price affect Indian oil price...there must be some standard?
6892 2018-05-21 11:57:26 Silly of course but I want to eat my soap @kingandprince Ingredients: olive oil, lemon balm, green tea, ginger root. @CortLeigh1 Resort life!
6893 2018-05-21 11:57:25 okay so my mum basically said she blended boiled beetroot chunks with a tahini paste (which is basically just roasted sesame seeds blended with olive oil). and she added some spices - she's saying add w/e spice taste you prefer. she wanted a slight desi taste so she added salt-

6895 2018-05-21 11:57:17 i have not checked closely the portfolios of Indian MF. I suspect their exposure is not much esp to PSBs. Even PSUs are not good inspite of monopolies like BEL,oil cos etc.All companies must be avoided like plague inspite of monopolies.
6896 2018-05-21 11:57:10 Umm agree with most of the points but the trade deficit was due to the collapse of the Soviet Union, due to which India had to purchase oil from Gulf, and after Kuwait’s invasion, oil prices really spiked.
6897 2018-05-21 11:57:04 @DarrellPowerNL They've found a lot of oil soaked sandstone rock (yes) under great pressure at depth, capped by shale, etc. Poke/drill a hole, and the oil gushes can be pumped out. Add pressure and more oil comes out. Like Hibernia. Done worldwide. Happy 50th.
6898 2018-05-21 11:57:02 Sorry during UPA international crude oil prices increased upto 122 USD but domestic price never crossed 74 in Delhi. How you are comparing ?
6899 2018-05-21 11:56:51 tullow which is an oil company not based in the UK...ocado is a genuine UK story though it has risen on the basis of a deal it has done for US growth...

6909 2018-05-21 11:56:15 So are you going to respond in the same manner against @realDonaldTrump or does Congress only care about “protecting democracy” in other countries then it does domestically in  America? Let’s not forget what Trump said about taking the oil down there...
6910 2018-05-21 11:56:08 I had to mute Robert's nonsense, he is a #Troll, clearly wasnt listening when his teacher went through this in class.
I mentioned Zimbabwe (huge gold & diamond mines) & Venezuela (enormous oil reserves) as examples of where it didnt work despite excellent assets. Just got an echo
6911 2018-05-21 11:56:05 Nepal and Bhutan are buying oil from India... And yet selling at a very low price... Even Indian citizens crossing border and going to Bhutan to get their tanks filled up...

U still have an excuse for petrol price hike??

6913 2018-05-21 11:55:53 I just heard my Trump-supporting father say that blaming increasing gas prices on Trump leaving the Iran deal is stupid because "we don't even buy oil from Iran." 
6914 2018-05-21 11:55:52 the rise is being driven by oil and mining companies..higher commodity prices are unrelated to the UK and may actually be negative for the UK economy..there is some more buying of UK equities by overseas investors I think as well
6915 2018-05-21 11:55:45 To conclude before i walk from this convo. I do not feel the Oilers stopped trying last season.I do not feel the Oilers are a bad team. I do feel they can turn it around.All that aside my intial tweet was celebrating the blue collar work ethic of the Knights

6923 2018-05-21 11:54:09 Petrol, Diesel prices will have a huge negative effect on NDA govt's and Modi's fate in 2019 LS elections. Modi government kept oil prices in check in the run-up to the Karnataka assembly elections, but the prices shooting up after the polls. It above 80/ litre in many cities.
6924 2018-05-21 11:54:08 You accidentally hit on a good point. We are exporting oil, while gas prices rise here, because oil is a fungible asset. It will go to whomever pays the most for it plus transport costs. once out of the ground for the ¢ paid for pumping on public lands it isn’t ours any more.
6925 2018-05-21 11:54:08 Agreed. It's very hard to find the right Doctors or Specialists in holistic mostly eastern proactive vs reactive medicine. Some of their concoctions are absolutely miracles.

6952 2018-05-21 11:51:00 It's good for some to have a higher price for their oil.

That we use giant straws to suck the oil from the ground instead of boring drills and that I’m COMPLETELY innocent. It was Larry and Gail.
6967 2018-05-21 11:49:11 Are you people educated or not. First the increase in prices is because of the increase in international crude price it has nothing to do with centre or oil companies. Next is you talk about centre for taxes on oil but why no body talk of state which charges 27% is Rs20 per ltr.

6969 2018-05-21 11:49:08 What is the plan of @BJP4India govt. to take the price of petrol to ₹100 ?. Why govt not reducing excise tax when it has made enough money cos of increasing oil prices. Why no cushion now to public?  #SlashOilTax
6970 2018-05-21 11:49:04 Wall Street traders will have their ears to the ground today to see if Trump hints at sanctioning PDVSA oil exports. If #Venezuela really knocked out of oil, $OIL goes to $90.  Then PSUV will blame US for a Bolivar worth less than a grain of sand.
6971 2018-05-21 11:48:52 I fully expect them to move the goalpost to 7-year avg or something similar, as I've said again in last Friday's Oil Viewsletter.

6982 2018-05-21 11:48:04 Oh well is everyone paid the same salary they were 7 years ago. Is the cost of operations same as 7 years ago, even the MP/MLA salary went up to 100% in the same period. It's not only the crude oil price that determine the cost of petrol. Several other operational costs.

6998 2018-05-21 11:45:58 we are talking of winning 2019 not loosing for 50000 crores. Save it by further selling PSUs which eating away capital. Ask oil company employees to reduce wage & travelling & other benefits by 25%.

7000 2018-05-21 11:45:49 So, despite rising oil prices, the growth rate reduced.

When we warned that several months of fuel scarcity wasn't going to help the economy, we were called names.

I guess the proof is out there now!!
7001 2018-05-21 11:45:45 It seems congress was better government that despite the price of crude oil reaching more than 105 dollar per barrel, the price of petrol in India didn't go beyond Rs. 75/-

7005 2018-05-21 11:45:31 Mr President Trump, since them china people are co-operating with you I wanted to rewards them by getting some of their food.   I puts some oil in the Pinto and found a place with a patriotic name: Great Wall Buffet.  So proud that even them china people want a wall built!
7006 2018-05-21 11:45:28 @Narendramodi_PM 
BJP most likely to loose all elections now becoz if stubbornness to reduce tax on oil...high oil prices and unemployment will lead to electoral losses for the govt- even in General Elections
7007 2018-05-21 11:45:20 #Iran is pinning its hopes on the #European Union in its efforts to skirt new US sanctions, while also courting #Russian and #Chinese investments to keep its #oil ambitions alive.
European customers account for one-third of Iranian exports
7008 2018-05-21 11:45:04 Do you add olive oil or anything else when roasting?
7009 2018-05-21 11:45:04 Ap kya kar sakte hai? What can you do for rising price of Petrol and Diesel except instigation of public against Central Government for getting your vote only? Can you issue some subsidy for Bengal public for oil price rise?If not, stop then your lecture.

7017 2018-05-21 11:44:14 Probably crude oil prices would reach Usd 100
7018 2018-05-21 11:44:08 With due respect sir, International oil prices in UPA was very high and peak of UPA time oil price was based on international crude price of 110 USD + 

During Modi regime Oil prices dropped and Govt increased duty
All we are asking is they should remove additional duties imposed

7028 2018-05-21 11:43:19 CPR assumed 11m barrels commercially extractable at $53 brent. At $80 brent and with ever improving tech, more oil should be commercially extractable from Liberator - adding upside. #i3e

But oil price now $78+.

7061 2018-05-21 11:39:18 Central and state governments should take immediate action to control oil prices.
7062 2018-05-21 11:39:13 Hey. No they only have the oil, the spray is out of order.
7063 2018-05-21 11:38:57 Government has also to tell measures taken by government to control CoP, including overheads of oil companies which equal royal expenditures. Tame them .
7064 2018-05-21 11:38:45 2 out of the 3 components of that snack use palm oil. The other uses sunflower oil. How bout using sunflower oil for all 3 and ditching the palm oil altogether?

7067 2018-05-21 11:38:14 Have you read about deficit? Do you know the Previous govt was providing oil at a subsidized rate? Are you able to interpret my words? If yes, then you will be embarrassed to post the message!

7073 2018-05-21 11:37:53 @narendramodi Sir, Extend the retirement age to 62 and use the deferred money to control/subsidise petrol and diesel price. Hardly few months for election to 2019 so oil prices will be decisive. Please RAISE THE RETIREMENT AGE TO 62 and use the money for  public welfare. No Delay

7081 2018-05-21 11:36:37 Reason is same : Like India Europe mostly imports oil mostly..
I think we all should focus on that. Y is so little oil is produced domestically?
7082 2018-05-21 11:36:13 [Premium Times] The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) on Monday disowned a list of 50 international and indigenous companies believed to have been awarded contracts to lift Nigeria's crude oil under the 2018/2020 trading year, describing it as "not official."

7102 2018-05-21 11:32:27 You're right on over-reliance on oil especially the way the UK has mismanaged such a bounty with Norway showing what should've been done. Much easier to build an industry benefiting it's population rather than fighting wars having nuclear weapons and giving tax cuts to the rich

7121 2018-05-21 11:29:26 We have to keep an eye on the carnival barker snake oil salesman-I wouldn't put it past him & Mnuchin to somehow make the tax payers pay for all of the Trump Teams defenses
7122 2018-05-21 11:29:15 @republic @timesofindia @IndianExpress the surge in oil prices @82 in Andhra Pradesh is too high n u r covering the same for onli Delhi which is @75. The common man is facing g the burnt with surge in prices.
7123 2018-05-21 11:29:06 Congratulations.....  Such due diligence is paying off with dividends again congrats
7124 2018-05-21 11:28:59 Bhakts be like -- if congress was to be in power, oil price would have been ₹100/ltr.

Bhakts rocks — feeling crazy
7125 2018-05-21 11:28:45 I love my car dealership because I can drop off my car for my oil change and they’ll take me to work #adulting
7126 2018-05-21 11:28:40 and, now that 1) US/FedFunds rates are going UP, USD is gaining (2-Yr T-bonds yields have spiked 100%!) and 2) Oil price is also UP 50% -- hence processed fuel (petrol) prices going UP; unlike mismanagement/horrendous economic policies like your #CorruptCongis rule. 2/2
7127 2018-05-21 11:28:37 While the government claims that there is no control over rates of oil by the government. 
Isn't it a CHHALAVA with the people??

7131 2018-05-21 11:28:26 But cannabis oil helps children with lots of issues - do you not want kids to be helped to feel better and to not suffer from seizures? Why do #ActuallyAutistic adults want #ActuallyAutistic kids to suffer and not have relief form seizures? That is very cruel.
7132 2018-05-21 11:28:25 Leaving the price determined by oil companies is easy policy as people faces the burden. MMS policy was to aborb this burden by the govt leaving at a stable price. People will appreciate MMS policy whenever the prices are high.

7135 2018-05-21 11:27:29 @narendramodi @arunjaitley please reduce the excise duty you increased (9 times) when Oil price was falling, now please reduce duty and provide some relief to common men.

7137 2018-05-21 11:27:09 the INR lost 50% (half it's value) against USD (Oil is priced in USD in global mkts) at a time (even!) when USD/FedFunds rate was rapidly falling; all when #CorruptCongress was in rule? - we are still bearing the brunt of that mismanagement. 1/2

7157 2018-05-21 11:22:28 But about the crude oil prices ?? Price of crude oil in International Market has reduced upto 50% and still we are paying higher price of fuel.
7158 2018-05-21 11:22:18 Callum wants to keep things as they are - because giving kids with autism things that help them is so horrible -
He does not want to help these kids - I am going to give my child cannabis oil
 But according to this band of jesters I am poisoning him #Insanity

7160 2018-05-21 11:21:44 "These criminal enterprises are making billions of dollars from human trafficking, health care fraud, computer intrusions, and copyright infringement. They are cornering the market on natural gas, oil, and precious metals, and selling to the highest bidder."
7161 2018-05-21 11:21:28 This illiterate stupid have no idea of  excise duty. it doesn't go to the lockers of BJP instead get  transferred 2 consolidated fund of India n is utilised for meeting capital n revenue expenditure, infrastructure progress of India n s d largest oil importer with $80 per barrel.
7162 2018-05-21 11:21:28 Sir, will the failure of this administration to reform the oil and gas sector affect the 2018 budget expectations and implementation?
7163 2018-05-21 11:21:21 Might be barbecue sauce? But I’ve heard of having ham with olive oil and balsamic on bread, so I imagine it’d work.
7164 2018-05-21 11:21:10 That's great kenya we are going on higher levels hope the oil products will lower the price especially the petroleum
7165 2018-05-21 11:21:02 @bibekdebroy 1) Inflation expected to rise due to crude oil & base metal price. 2) Spike in G-sec Yield spike leading to increasing MCLR / higher interest rate. However, since pvt capex cycle is picking up (strong Q4FY18 & FY18 mgmt commmentary & new capex lined-up) (1/2)
7166 2018-05-21 11:20:53 Petrol and Diesel were lower in KA as prev govt reduced state taxes.. it appalling that you dont see how many times the centre has increased excise to counter the fall in global oil prices & not transferring the benefit the customer! Its called organised LOOT!
7167 2018-05-21 11:20:11 add in the fact the oil money is squandered in trying to balance books caused by uk economic mismanagement starting with Thatcher. uk cannot do without it and everyone knows that.
7168 2018-05-21 11:20:06 Yes, broadly I agree with Jimmy Song, that lots of blockchain projects will go nowhere. And they hype is spectacularly unhelpful.

But some projects will add value. An old cowboy oil prospector had to dig a lot of holes to nowhere before striking oil.
7169 2018-05-21 11:20:05 Why does oil make us one of the wealthiest countries in the west? Please explain what you mean.
7170 2018-05-21 11:20:03 Funds used this amount for other use when ban on Iran was lifted Iran made a demand to make payment of full amount and threatened to cut off Oil supply.Hence extra amount was used to make payment to Iran for previous supply during congress rule.This is main reason
7171 2018-05-21 11:19:58 That’s just called Olive Oil.
7172 2018-05-21 11:19:44 #RBD #WICK 
Wick is an exploration opportunity and is considered to have P50 Prospective Resources of around 50 million barrels of oil in Jurassic and Triassic aged sands.

Wick will be tested by a well in H2 2018 at an estimated total cost of £4.2 million.

7177 2018-05-21 11:19:20 Also presumably oil prices just raising breakevens almost mechanically
7178 2018-05-21 11:19:06 Look you are spreading all kind of nuisances. Stop it right now. Petrol prices are dependant on Crude Oil prices. Then on top that prices in 2018 has to be more than 2003 cos there is something called INFLATION. Your personal hatred towards BJP or MODI should not harm the country

7182 2018-05-21 11:18:46 Also I can understand a shop making compromises on stocking food made commercially with palm oil, but when you deliberately use it in your own bakery?! Serious flaws in the vegan high-horse.

7184 2018-05-21 11:18:34 Yep. Least Trump made the Saudi's happy. After all were they not the ones complaining about how cheap the barrel of oil was?

7188 2018-05-21 11:17:48 Theresa May, delaying a visa for Abramovich is a delayed starting point for dirty money. This guy starts a business from his flat and suddenly he's a multi-billionaire in oil exports. He probably got there because of his love for putin. Leave him in bad old russia.
7189 2018-05-21 11:17:18 Chota Chetan  don't you have smart phone to check international Crude oil  price per barrel

7190 2018-05-21 11:17:16 Richest oil company in the world, mate. Pretty sure the mismanagement of their natural assets for more than a decade is why the country is failing.
7191 2018-05-21 11:17:16 "Vegan croissants"...handmade with margarine and palm oil. A clear cow-welfare conscience but at the expense of putting nasties in your body and supporting rainforest destruction.
7192 2018-05-21 11:17:10 They're definitely paying an oil state/English league premium though. Juve would never be asked for that had it been them.

7198 2018-05-21 11:16:23 Mr Shetty do you know the reality,fact is that there was ban on Iran and Iran was not  allowed to accept payment from other countries for supply of Oil hence for 10yrs although India received oil supply but made no payment.Your favourite congress Govt instead of making buffer 1/2
7199 2018-05-21 11:16:17 well until you pay me do ur own research but only London and se England make surplus. The rest uk is in red but Scotland does better than most of rest. Thats how uk economy is designed but it need not be. dont forget oil which makes us one of the wealthiest countries in the west

7209 2018-05-21 11:14:41 @KellyannePolls OIL PRICES WERE LOW BEFORE IRAN DEAL.  Somebody investigate the false inflating of OIL prices just to make President look bad.  We produce so much of our own oil now.  This is a BIG deal to Americans on low fixed income.
7210 2018-05-21 11:14:09 Bhai Agar international level pe Oil k price badenge to apne ap hi har desh me petrol diesel k price badna hai....Ab sarkar America aur Iran k bich to nhi aa sakti na...Sirf India me price km karwane k liye...

7212 2018-05-21 11:14:03 No I am saying that you are being foolish to fight against anything which helps autistic people.

7234 2018-05-21 11:09:57 Oil prices at its high.  Surprising that OMCs remember moderating prices only few days/ weeks before voting and continue to moderate till the date of voting. It happened before election in Delhi, Gujrat and Karnataka. They say it is their decision. What a big lie and non-sense.
7235 2018-05-21 11:09:53 With more oil reserves than any country, Venezuela could be wealthy - but its economic collapse is getting worse.

7254 2018-05-21 11:06:51 #FuelPriceHike The price of petrol and diesel has reached its peak and what is surprising for the common man is that these prices are associated with crude oil prices at just above $80 a barrelBut this was not the case when the price was $140 a barrel?understand these dynamics?
7255 2018-05-21 11:06:42 The oil is non renewables source and in long term prices will go higher. So optimum policy is to tax at higher rate to curb consumption, and to encourage development of alternative sources.
7256 2018-05-21 11:06:23 Oil price hike touches historical barrier of the limits. @narendramodi @aajtak . भाईयों और बहनों एक मौका और अगली बार दो सौ पार एक बार फिर भाजपा सरकार l
7257 2018-05-21 11:06:07 History always repeats itself. Oil money, power of incumbency and federal might failed Goodluck Jonathan woefully in 2015. Buhari is walking daily on the same path of turbulent history toward 2019.
7258 2018-05-21 11:06:02 Sir I am fan of Modiji however logic which you showed is not logical. if you would have put petrol price in india and crud oil price in international mkt than comparison would be more factually correct. Now govt meet to reduce the Tax which they incresed during low internal price

7261 2018-05-21 11:04:41 PS. Tea Tree oil and The Ordinary are THE ONES. 
Plus the cheapest out there.
7262 2018-05-21 11:04:34 EU  bucks US sanctions on Iran by  enforcing the "blocking statute" that allows European firms to claim damages from the sanctions and stops EU courts from enforcing rulings by foreign courts. The sanctions are expected to cut Iran oil exports by around half to 1 mln barrels/day.

7264 2018-05-21 11:04:27 Howdy, Julio. Hope you are well, man. Enno reports oil and gas separately, the most likely difference is the IEA is using BOE.  Remember, from LTO investor presentations the E in EUR stands for excessively estimated.  Enno's stuff is actual reported, realized production data.

7267 2018-05-21 11:03:58 And can we restart that oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico?
7268 2018-05-21 11:03:57 So the team is obviously good however they have had many advantages as it turns out. The Knights did not have to carry any dead weight or huge over pay contracts like the Oilers. In the same vein they were smart enough to grab the best goalie and management people.
7269 2018-05-21 11:03:38 The main argument in favour of the union is the added security of dividing any economic risk; we've already seen how disastrous over reliance on oil could have been, when it was a major pillar of the Yes campaign (and never should have been).
7270 2018-05-21 11:03:30 I just saw Q1 GDP it was 2% YoY despite and increase in oil price and volumes. That means the non oil part of the economy went backwards by at least 1% YoY. For a country growing population by 2.5-3% this is atrocious economic performance.

The truth is that Scotland keeps the value to £ always has although the propaganda would have you believe that we are beggars . Scotland leaves the £ drops.  They will never let you leave the union even if you vote for it

7382 2018-05-21 10:45:50 .@JaiveerShergill is nuts. Will he explain people why Congress during UPA2 didn't paid IRAN for oil import and the 1000s of Cr pending payment was landed on Modi in 2014?
7383 2018-05-21 10:45:45 If there was no oil, we would have practiced true federalism.

7387 2018-05-21 10:45:22 Lowering pump prices will encourage smuggling to nearby oil deficient countries. Additional revenues should be used to cushion the elderly and other venerable groups.

7392 2018-05-21 10:44:50 The first thing is that a risotto should be NO OLIVE OIL (except for a risotto with seafood). Also the broth needs to be hot during the boiling/drying/boiling process.
7393 2018-05-21 10:44:49 An unsurprising "election" result in #Venezuela. With economic crisis deepening amid hyperinflation, collapsing oil production and asset seizures by creditors triggered by a growing wave of defaults, Maduro's victory could well prove short lived.
7394 2018-05-21 10:44:43 Higher tax on oil is always strategic and makes good economics. Why recent rise in oil price is not adding to inflation as it use to happen before..?? Barring few inefficient economies keep oil price low..
7395 2018-05-21 10:44:19 Is it just the oil price holding the Loonie up?
7396 2018-05-21 10:44:14 おっ？おっ？あれっ？もしかしてもしかして？

7406 2018-05-21 10:42:37 Just earlier, I applied oil onto my sword so it has great sharpness. If you touch it even slightly, your fingers would be cut and blood could spill.

7408 2018-05-21 10:41:34 Scottish whisky is sold out for years in advance and we need need more distilleries. it is the 3rd top export in the UK and sell 3 times more than its nearest rival. add £2 tax to every bottle and forget about oil. as whisky make up a 1/4 of all UK food and drink exports

7413 2018-05-21 10:41:14 When crude oil price were down for 4 yrs, Govt did not plan futuristic and now running helter-skelter.

7414 2018-05-21 10:41:08 And then rub pure coconut oil on ma face.
7415 2018-05-21 10:40:49 That wasn't the case at all with me here. I was talking about the Knights, the Oilers were not even in my thoughts when i sent the initial message.
7416 2018-05-21 10:40:46 Excise duty increased instead of passing on benefits to customers just to fill gap between fiscal deficit. That's amount around Rs. 20-25 per litre..which was supposed to roll back once oil prices on rising mode.
7417 2018-05-21 10:40:31 George Miller, MD, also made Lorenzo’s Oil.
7418 2018-05-21 10:40:31 That's interesting strategy... Crude is over $78 and that's not good for oil marketing companies. Usually, people short in this situation. But you bought, are you expecting Crude to come down or you happy with premium collected from the call?

7430 2018-05-21 10:39:45 Problem with this analysis from the capital of America’s oil & gas industry is that it ignores history and the law of supply and demand.

When coal and nuclear plants actually stop production, there is an immediate increase in demand for gas.

That increases nat gas prices
7431 2018-05-21 10:39:44 1) The combined impact of fossil fuels (historic emissions, agricultural run-off, oil spills and plastic pollution) on ocean health. 2) The impacts of rising seas & severe storms on coastal heritage 3) The continuation/expansion of exploitative commodity trading, that's shipped

7433 2018-05-21 10:39:40 Cheaper oil will not necessarily make people burn more oil. Rather it will bring down transportation, lot of other costs & inflation. Isn’t that a good thing ?
7434 2018-05-21 10:39:35 Wet wipes help with "sticky bits". Or eucalyptus oil - although it can burn if it's a sensitive spot.

7437 2018-05-21 10:39:12 This fool also took advantage of East Timor when its people were being massacred by the Indonesian army. He came in after the massacre and tried to fool people in thinking that Aust saved Timor when in fact, it was ready to bully and steal Timor's oil and gas.
7438 2018-05-21 10:39:12 Also the coconut oil was easier to use than I thought.
7439 2018-05-21 10:39:03 It's not for long. It's because the trade war with China is on hold for now. But you know trump is erratic and unstable. High oil prices will cause a spike in treasury yields due to core inflation rising. Rally is short lived. My opinion
7440 2018-05-21 10:39:03 LOL.
Share the crude oil data from 2003 to 2018.
Do you really think no one knows the price of crude oil then and now?

7463 2018-05-21 10:36:19 Would be more appropriate if you also take crude oil prices that time when comparing... it's about how resources are managed under given circumstances.
7464 2018-05-21 10:36:09 Venezuela election: Maduro won another 6yr term amid millions' boycott led by opposition coalition. Turnout ~48%, lowest since Chavez in 1998. UN refuses to certify election as fair. US won't recognize winner and sanctions against oil industry under "active review"

7465 2018-05-21 10:35:55 Big oil doesn't spend millions in political contributions to the GOP for regulations and $30pb oil they do it for deregulation and $140+ pb oil and we get the bill for all of it
7466 2018-05-21 10:35:38 But we can cut back until there is another oil boom then spend again.Why argue with forty years.Just like Ralph did it.

7469 2018-05-21 10:35:03 Yes, but the point being made was that the SNP were not a minority government. They do work together with the greens on certain issues but by no means all of them.

7475 2018-05-21 10:34:14 Because Indians don't produce oil enough, and those who can afford to buy have been addicted to subsidized prices.

7478 2018-05-21 10:34:04 Agreed its things combined; primarily, sugar and seed oil. Traditional diets high in SFA don't result in diabetes.

7513 2018-05-21 10:29:37 So, cheaper oil means less demand for canadian dollars to buy canadian oil

7515 2018-05-21 10:29:26 Ryanair is likely to fuel cost rising by 400m Euro next year, despite hedging 90% of FY19 oil at $58/bbl! Imagine what fuel costs when it goes to $80/bbl in FY20. #rya #airline #FuelPrice
7516 2018-05-21 10:28:57 Hundreds of thousands immigrants, BP and Total are taking all the contracts there, oil and gas fornitures are no more stable and guaranteed.
Is better for Europe? I don't know.
Is better for Italy? For sure not.

7518 2018-05-21 10:28:44 Wait until oil drops, it is a petro dollar, as canadian oil can be purchased only with canadian dollars by law.

Oil exports are 50-55% of canadian exports.
7519 2018-05-21 10:28:32 Crude oil price in 2014: 123 dollars. In 2016: 30 dollars. Now 78 dollars. Aap jaise moorkhon ki kami nahi hai isliye modi ji pm hain

7523 2018-05-21 10:27:40 The true question is. how did all those weapons get to these country's. Fuck'd up country's like usa, Israel and saudi arabia are sending weapons to rich oil country's with poor army's just to start chaos and take control over those country's..
Fuck the new world order and dollar
7524 2018-05-21 10:27:10 We cannot have a common foreign policy: our interests are too different.
For example take the Libya affair: it was one of Italy major oil and gas supplier, we had ENI doing great business there and Gheddafi was patrolling his borders avoiding huge masses of immigrants.
And now?
7525 2018-05-21 10:27:05 With increasing oil prices & depreciating rupee, can Govt limit its greed & change tax basis from ad valerom to per liter?
7526 2018-05-21 10:27:04 high prices of crude oil + taxes (adjusted including TRAIN) = Catastrophe.

He said.Oh, well it comes from oil. And oil is natural. But humans dont use natural oil. They alter & change it
7560 2018-05-21 10:21:15 Additionally, you should research more how this oil rich country funded itself on oil and got itself on the abyss of complete failure. It wasn’t always this way. Government legitimacy and a government that actually wants (reread: wants) to provide for the people is key.
7561 2018-05-21 10:21:08 Synonymous to Nigeria. I'm glad the oil is drying up. There's a level playing field now.

7588 2018-05-21 10:17:05 @narendramodi Sir,  In view of 2019 election, the Government has definitely review its Oil Price policy where all common people have great concern over the increase of oil price on regularity, the  same point with which the Congress is also playing a cunning and foul game.

Name them
7596 2018-05-21 10:15:33 I thought CBS oil was now legal in all 50. Will check. I recently ordered some oil & cream online. I too have arthritis ( osteo in knees) it helps. Being a nurse on feet a lot. Again Gary good luck with that!
7597 2018-05-21 10:15:26 I wouldn’t be so quick to dismiss it. A taste of oil when you’re parched for a cuppa cha wouldn’t put off a proper tea addict. I’ve had Irish UN Congo veterans who used the Vickers mention using condenser water for tea when we display our replica.
7598 2018-05-21 10:15:17 The same oil which fuels lavish SUVs also fuels the tractors, threshers in rural areas. Indirect taxations are non progressive in nature hence if the motive is to fill up the coffers instead of detering its use, then its an ill-conceived one
7599 2018-05-21 10:15:11 We're sorry if you were alarmed! This is actually a mixture of oil and crumbs that can sometimes form during packaging.

7603 2018-05-21 10:14:46 The only thing that would make the USA attack Iran, would be if they started a trade of crude oil in another currency than US$, thus threatening the position of US$ as reference currency. One analyst even went to the point of saying that the attack would occur "within days"

7618 2018-05-21 10:11:49 Earlier the high price of crude oil was compensated by subsidy and subsidy is our money only (tax payer)so with subsidy it was 80 and without subsidy it might would have been around 120 to 150rs per litre so it is less than the previous prices at 2012 i.e 80rs per litre 1/2

7644 2018-05-21 10:08:28 I’m not happy either. Let’s hope our dependence on oil will steady decrease the coming years.

7781 2018-05-21 09:43:44 I saw Republicans do similar here in Space Coast after @BarackObama was elected, blaming him with notes on pumps for higher gas prices. Truth was oil demand cratered during recession. Prices went up with demand as economy recovered.  Truth ≠ GOP.

7803 2018-05-21 09:41:14 Fully agree dada. It is naive to assume that punitive taxes on oil prices will limit demand. Rather if you jack up prices of vehicles and subsidised electric as a compensation then it may work out.

7912 2018-05-21 09:26:40 Yaar this is a wrong idea. We import 80 percent of our oil and costly oil is a form of carbon tax and depresses demand. It is good for country even if it is costly for individuals. Lower taxes means more imports and more revenues for Wahhabis.

8035 2018-05-21 09:06:34 Aren’t refineries and oil companies also government owned? And why is privatisation bad overall? Think of the reforms in the telecom sector for example. Of course, corny capitalism, like Ambani and Adani, is bad, no doubt.

8041 2018-05-21 09:05:42 I wasn't blaming Turkey. I was noting:

- Turkey provides Israel oil 
- Yet I don't see Zionists grateful for extending them the favor
- They just pile on and criticize Erdogan, calling him names. They bash him constantly yet Assad gets a free pass or kept under the radar.
8042 2018-05-21 09:05:38 Also remember City massively underachieved. They are funded by an oil rich country not shareholders. If my club had unlimited funds, which city have despite their protestations, I’d expect them to win every trophy available every year.

8116 2018-05-21 08:52:12 The excise duty was Rs 9 per litre in 2013 when oil prices were $110 per barrel. Today it is Rs 19 per litre, when the oil prices are $80 per barrell. Add to that the state taxes, and Mr @narendramodi's achhe din are right there, can you not see?!

8178 2018-05-21 08:39:39 Btw you'll not remember this but Unionist scoffed at the idea of Oil reaching $100 saying it would never happen. Where is the price right now 

An no I am not talking about our oil wealth, which is considerable, but our oil reserves an energy production.
8179 2018-05-21 08:39:02 Back in NY we used to use lemongrass oil to repeal mosquitos, so probably a similar thing

8185 2018-05-21 08:37:58 He congratulated Chavez on his democratic election. Chavez is dead.Maduro has overseen the collapse of his country, spiriting none of the huge oil profits from the world's largest reserves away for a rainy day. It then poured when oil prices fell and Maduro is out of his depth
8186 2018-05-21 08:37:58 Well, seeing that capitalism has failed, according to the Left, maybe it's time #Venezuela tried... Socialism!  Oh, wait, it has, says the Left, but not "real" Socialism. Under "real" Socialism, the oil is never "exploited". Problem solved, comrades.

Now say who looted
8189 2018-05-21 08:37:44 The Rand keeps weakening. Brent Crude Oil price keeps going up. We're still gonna get a beating on fuel prices. I wanna start jogging to work .
8190 2018-05-21 08:37:38 The reason is when the International crude oil price was low the Govt shudhv built a reserve instead it did nothing. Whereas now if it has to cut the taxes there has to b some election in any State else very soon we wl end up paying appx Rs 100 per ltr of Petrol... Just watch

8200 2018-05-21 08:36:25 Brilliant question.. the answer lies in decades of controlled #Oil prices thereby killing the oil companies , make them dependent on govt and seduce the consumer by false low prices. Twas politics at its worst .. suffered it for decades and those who did it asking today ?

8202 2018-05-21 08:35:56 Speaking of spill response, it took 2 days for a response to the 2015 English Bay Bunker oil fuel spill to properly materialize.  Concerns:
1.  Company doesn’t report spill immediately. 
2. Ocean currents can be widely unpredictable.
3. “World-Class” spill response has limits...
8203 2018-05-21 08:35:48 Petrol prices on Sunday touched a record high of Rs 76.24 per litre and diesel climbed to its highest-ever level of Rs 67.57 as the oil PSUs passed on four weeks of relentless rise in international oil prices to consumers.

8237 2018-05-21 08:29:44 It's higher because we are importing more than we export. Crude oil is 80% of our import. India is trying to increase it's exports, but under the current global issues(from protectionism by Trump, Brexit, to  nations who dump their products like China) exports aren't picking

8272 2018-05-21 08:23:10 Venezuela has the largest proven oil reserves of any nation. HOWEVER, this means nothing if you cannot extract at a low cost. Mostly tar sands from Orinoco basin, as I understand. So it is capacity to produce and cost of production that is crippling its economy.

8275 2018-05-21 08:22:57 Oil rises because the CFTC does not regulate speculators.  Oil rises because the media gives them a pass and does not investigate the largest screwing of consumers in history.

8376 2018-05-21 08:04:44 @VictoriaLIVE please be more clear on your reporting of Cannabis Oil. CBD is legal you can buy it in Holland & Barrett. It's THC that is illegal. Not all Cannabis/Hemp  products are illegal. Education not generalisation.
8377 2018-05-21 08:04:36 I have more thoughts on this than would fit in a Tweet-storm. Key takes: 1) data is the new oil/minerals; tech firms are definitely rent seekers 2) tech firms should provide support to robust public services - they should not be directly providing public services themselves 1/n
8378 2018-05-21 08:04:27 Ripping up the Iran deal has spiked oil prices. Trade war talk, hollowing out the US State Dept.,  and saber rattling with North Korea also affect oil prices.

8445 2018-05-21 07:55:29 So why did the price of oil going down receive headline news in the press along with the usual rubbish about it running out soon?

8470 2018-05-21 07:50:27 yes and that is why from 2014-17 when gov hiked excise duty even due to fall in oil prices millions understood and supported but as we stood 4 gov in their bad times we expect them to stand with us now in our bad phase...

8568 2018-05-21 07:37:38  @narendramodi petroleum minister is least bothered. everytime he is asked about it, his same stereotype response is - in international market, price of crude oil has gone up @dpradhanbjp

Try to turn OFF your power for a week, and dont buy somthing made OFF Oil. After you done this for a week, we Will see If you Can survive
8571 2018-05-21 07:36:40 with oil going to 90 in 1 or 2 months...........brazil will divert most of its sugar into ethanol, global sugar surplus will convert into deficit
8572 2018-05-21 07:36:36 5000円かな？
8573 2018-05-21 07:36:09 Oil will climb to $100/ barrel soon and Venezuela will have a decent economic output again. The US really wants Maduro to fail before then so they can stake a claim to the oil, but it won’t happen.

8581 2018-05-21 07:34:57 Siddharamaiah's govt spent more than 700 cr 3 months before election on glorifying its non achievements. It was not loot. great. It has become a fashion to talk about oil prices. 1970 it was 0.94 ps/litre. Who raised it to 40rs in ten yrs.
8582 2018-05-21 07:34:33 Such as Oil. Then after a few years they decided to hit back. Now the West... just like Trump scream unfair. So in a way you are right Its not like ISIS as they were created by the Yanks and funded by Israeli cash. 
I am not defending what ISIS are doing, however thinks a lesson
8583 2018-05-21 07:34:18 Does anyone have a gooodddd review of mora essential calissa oil by mira filzah???? Help a sister outttt
8584 2018-05-21 07:34:17 These lipsticks look absolutely terrific- two important ingredients included are : Argan oil to hydrate and calendula for anti inflammatory properties. I would be delighted to #win them 
8585 2018-05-21 07:34:10 Fuel prices depend on crude oil prices, the rupee $ exchange rate and local taxes. Both crude oil prices and $ are higher and govt has limited control on that. Hence the govt should lower the very high existing taxes on petrol and diesel.
8586 2018-05-21 07:34:01 Use coconut oil to make sure you get all of it off! I like to apply some extra on my eyelashes after I wash the excess off (with face wash) to help them grow :)
8587 2018-05-21 07:34:00 Economic Illiterate, Low oil prices battered economy.  If GEJ remained in power, I don't even want to imagine how this country would have been run with his team of looters in charge of the economy.

8590 2018-05-21 07:33:18 The pleasantness of this is likened to the holy anointing oil. This is the fruit of the Spirit, the proof of our union with Christ, and adorns his gospel. It is profitable as well as pleasing; it brings blessings numerous as the drops of dew
8591 2018-05-21 07:33:14 I am not advocating subsidising, but look for alternative solution. Hike on oil prices does not only affect  commute but also basic necessities. Currentl excise duty & state tax, constitute almost 50% of the cost of petrol, which is absurd.

On a similar note, ever gave a thought to .. take away the oil exploitation & superpower geopolitics .. & Muslims will still find a way to justify their inter-sects genocide.
8651 2018-05-21 07:22:34 3) you also need to consider Chavez attempted to rebalance the economy investing in education & infrastructure & was attempting to diversify the economy which was too heavily reliant on oil revenues. That’s fine for allies of the US but not if your politics is against theirs.

8692 2018-05-21 07:15:57 It seems Ryanair hedged the oil.

8736 2018-05-21 07:10:07 We were actually paying a lot more for oil during UPA rule. Since govt was controlling oil prices, it had to pay our tax money to oil companies for offsetting the loses. So we ended up paying even more.
8737 2018-05-21 07:10:01 Crude Oil
1. Before inventory date on Wednesday we might go down
2. After that more sideways movement

Boss what did you do when the crude prices went down? Why fuel prices still went UP? 

Any answer Mr. @narendramodi or Mr @AmitShah ??
8762 2018-05-21 07:06:28 Why won’t countries purchase oil from Venezuela? because they’re trying to reach socialism and the bourgeoisie West won’t allow it.

8765 2018-05-21 07:05:13 Naaah, i think oil revenue would be lower without him. That's like disowning his contribution to petronas.

well it's ceteris paribus, u analyse one factor at a time. holding everything else constant, would changing mahathir with someone else make things better? i'd argue yes.

8828 2018-05-21 06:52:10 You’re right! Trump is extremely smart, but only in a conniving and manipulative way! In other words,  he knows how to sell snake oil better than most, however, it looks like his pathological lies are starting to catch up with him

8831 2018-05-21 06:50:42 Policy wise, other countries had it too. Everybody welcomed the money from Japan. As for mahathir, most of his investments failed. Sure that didnt stop us from leaping upwards due to money from japan, oil revenues poured into west coast and location.
8832 2018-05-21 06:50:40 Fuel prices depend on crude oil prices for which Indian government has no control over it. But for the relief of common men at least govt should lower the very high existing taxes on petrol and diesel by itself and by the states governments or to be cover under GST.

8845 2018-05-21 06:48:48 It's one of the stupidest supply chains I've ever seen. Letting the Yankees handle our petrol supply, what lunacy.

The energy east plan had merits for donestic refining but even that was a terrible plan. Alberta has all this oil it apparently has no idea what to do with.
8846 2018-05-21 06:48:31 What if oil is a substance required for the earth to sustain itself and we just sucking it dry 
8847 2018-05-21 06:48:31 We could give a lot of teachers a raise if we defunded PP - which turns a PROFIT in the BILLIONS. Why do they need taxpayer support if they are so profitable? The left would have a fit if we funded oil companies.
8848 2018-05-21 06:48:27 It's good to see people intensely explaining international oil businesses and economy to defend petrol prices. I wish one of those who are obsessed with the glorious past of India could have invented vehicles which ran without petrol...

Countries should show a wise stance. Trump's crusade will lead to explosive price hike on the oil market affecting the economies worldwide.
8857 2018-05-21 06:46:13 The price of Crude Oil is less more than 40% in the INTERNATIONAL MARKET. SRI LANKA who Imports Petrol & Diesel, Charges much less from their Citizens than INDIA does. That shows that the Modi Govt is over charging their own Citizens.

Endorse it.

8907 2018-05-21 06:38:56 Dear so call journo
Crude oil is not locally available resource in India. Govt. Is not producing it from their pockets. It is imported and many factors like forex, geopolitics, etc. , Will all effect petrol prices. 
Journalists are not so bright.

8937 2018-05-21 06:32:11 Sir, oil prices are going high in international market, touching around $80/barrel. Venezuela crisis, US-Iran nuclear deal are reasons of prices going high. Though 44% tax on petrol and diesel is not reasonable.

8959 2018-05-21 06:27:20 Worth every penny. Also I used the super 1400 to flush my old oil. You can use a regular flush liquid too. Just that the engine wasn't cool & I was in a hurry. 

Which car it is?
8960 2018-05-21 06:27:18 Thank you for an interesting anecdote. It reminds me of the American Express salad oil scandal of the early 1960s. Eventually someone climbed the ladder, looked in the vat, and saw it was empty. Buffet made a killing on his investment in American Express later when it bottomed.

8965 2018-05-21 06:26:22 Yeah I think this is a real threat. China has just recently launched a crude oil contract in yuan, i think it just needs time for adoption.
8966 2018-05-21 06:26:21 U knw ...prices in Intl market increasing steeply.
So burden on common man like us ( not u like VIPs).
We can't control Intl prices ...so at least we can reduce  taxes to give some relief.
I hope u knw that there is so much change in crude oil prices in last 2 years.

Well, no global climate debate now (it's 2 a.m.).

But huge discovery of the oil field under Texas, the opening of ANWAR in Alaska, fracking, all will have us as top energy producer in 2019. Plus NatGas!

If Iran and NoKo moderate, even more in world.

8984 2018-05-21 06:23:20 What a wonderful shot and fab idea. In Italian we call it "calma piatta" that translate literally as "flat calm" aka dead calm. In Italian has a slight unnerving meaning, as a nation of sailors we do not like the absence of wind.  Also colloquially: "un olio" (pure oil)
8985 2018-05-21 06:23:12 #HNR RNS. Strategy update. Cash flow from E Denver to be applied in further work on Helios & DT Ultravert + adding further shale plays. Oil at $highs. IMO the big seller from past months seems to have cleared & perhaps some forward momentum can return us to 30p now. 
8986 2018-05-21 06:22:32 There should be a global ban on trophy hunting. This is what the US should be doing to other countries than taking oil.
8987 2018-05-21 06:22:29 It's time to include Oil products in GST architecture in my opinion.
8988 2018-05-21 06:22:00 Hak ah,cleansing oil dulu baru cleanser biasa. Cleansing oil biha pakai once a day. Sebelum pm routine hehe.
8989 2018-05-21 06:21:42 The 2018 budget is based on crude oil benchmark. We increase benchmark from $45 per barrel to $51  per barrel. This is sheer market speculation. What happens if the oil price falls? We must be aggressive on diversifying our economy.Mono-economy is a stagnation to our development!

8994 2018-05-21 06:20:45 I condemn, once again, the unprecedented hike in petrol and diesel prices. The Central Govt, which benefited from the dip in global crude oil prices, has punished the poor and middle classes through out. I call upon the BJP to cap fuel prices immediately.@mkstalin
8995 2018-05-21 06:20:44 Silly accusations from Congi spokesperson. How can the proceeds from oil sales by Oil PSU can go to party’s coffers? In fact Oil PSU’s recovered their heavy losses incurred during UPA rule only after 2014. How long any govt can keep oil prices low by subsidising heavyweight

8998 2018-05-21 06:20:40 I’d say average is 3.80 depending on which unleaded or premium. But that tweet was also a year ago. I recall it being way cheaper last year. It seems to be a 2-3 year cycle the oil companies charade us through. .

9005 2018-05-21 06:19:41 Oil prices up is an affective way to kind of lift sanctions without really doing it. Petrocurrency bodies need to move oil.
9006 2018-05-21 06:19:32 It's not rocket science. The courts have ruled that pro-choice is a constitutional right. No such legislation exists regarding the oil industry. Therefore, gov't funds should be withheld from the former and permitted for the latter.
9007 2018-05-21 06:19:28 Watch out for soy. Even in water. Sardines, on the other hand, are typically soy-free and have a bunch of yummy little bones (even the filets).  If it has to be albacore, I can usually find this Italian one packed in olive oil. Good stuff.
9008 2018-05-21 06:19:24 We change that by making the US the world leading oil exporter.

9011 2018-05-21 06:18:45 Also, if it says light/fat free on it, they added sugar. So, it’s worse than the good stuff. Compare the labels for yourself. Grill/broil/bake/roast not deep fry.  It’ll make a huge difference. Use butter not margarine. Sugar and hydrogenated oil are the enemy! Fat isn’t.

9013 2018-05-21 06:18:39 So for three weeks while Modi and Amit Shah were gallivanting in Karnataka, the petrol/diesel prices were fixed/unmoving. Now that phase of bhashaning is over, petrol/diesel price is going through the roof. What do Bhakts say? #diesel #oil #gasprices
9014 2018-05-21 06:18:38 So let me get this straight. Risk yourself drowning instead of using a lifejacket because you don't agree with a pipeline and tanker traffic that could kill a 10 billion dollar bc tourist industry plus add dirty oil to.the atmosphere. Thanks Einstein
9015 2018-05-21 06:18:25 Despite steep increase in oil prices, we don't find a single vehicle off the road. This suggest the surging prices are not hitting the people. May I request the people of the country to give away car driving and uses public transport.
9016 2018-05-21 06:18:14 UK RNS today - not much selection in the larger caps!

9036 2018-05-21 06:13:13 I'm not saying these taxes should increase the gas prices. Since a booming gas industry is top of the line free money. The governments should simply receive bigger portions out of oil sales than anyone else should. Lucky I am a nature girl. You see I don't drive or use gasoline.

9065 2018-05-21 06:08:09 To be fair they were greenwashing the oil and gas industry in the faint hope of getting the K-M pipeline through. Also the health aspect of decommissioning of the coal fired plants imp. However they were  being decommissioned slowly by the PCs; no need really to do it fast.

9067 2018-05-21 06:07:39 Lol, people are still talking about Iraq having nothing to do with 9-11 like it was new information. 
It was pretty clear at the time. Afghanistan is the country the US attacked over 9-11. Iraq was attacked over oil, Kuwait, and to 'free Iraq from a dictator'.

9073 2018-05-21 06:07:05 Me, me. Stopped buying Marks & Spencer bread, for example. Read Joanna Blythman on the topic. Even 'sustainable' palm oil is problematic. Big agriculture, factory farming, are destroying the world.
9074 2018-05-21 06:07:02 Since when does Venezuela have "the world's largest oil reserves"? I stand to be corrected on this, but larger than Saudi Arabia? #r4today @BBCNews

9076 2018-05-21 06:06:56 It seems China  decided to not provide country of origin details when it publishes the April trade oil data later this week. Would have been interesting to see those Iranian import numbers.

Fuel prices depend on global crude oil prices, d rupee $ exchange rate.Both crude oil prices & $ r higher & govt has limited control on that.

9120 2018-05-21 05:59:43 Back in the '90s, Texas oil magnates used to refer to $100 million as a "unit". As in, how many units do you have? DeVos has a LOT of units.

9122 2018-05-21 05:59:17 RIL has their own oil rigs and refineries, they use to only export 4 years back as govt then did not provide subsidy to private players. Now the subsidy is lifted without explanation. So RIL is now leading in retail fuel sales so increase in rates is by and large benefiting them.

9129 2018-05-21 05:58:40 Multi-national oil companies send a variety of products through the existing line. This includes crude oil to refineries in Vancouver and in Washington State. They send diluted bitumen to to Burnaby, not to Washington. Washington refineries get most of their crude ol from Alaska.

HAIR:

- don’t over wash your hair!!

- wash it 3-4 times a week.

- use shampoo or conditioners that don’t contain silicone, sulfate or any other chemicals that will dry out your hair.

- apply coconut/almond oil before you go te bed and wash it the next day

9200 2018-05-21 05:47:11 Kenya will start the small scale export of crude oil from its fields in the far northern county of Turkana in June after an agreement on how to share the revenue, averting delays. Tullow Oil and its partner Africa Oil discovered commercial reserves in the Lokichar basin in 2012.

9209 2018-05-21 05:46:22 Waste oil can be converted into a H2 rich gaseous fuel known as MagneGas. Any type of carbon rich wet or dry waste materials with a zero emission refinery by the MagneGas Corporation is worth investigating.

9211 2018-05-21 05:46:14 Sino-Japanese war will be swift and brutal and China will lost almost all of their materiel; 1/2 of their oil & 25% of their ag imports.
9212 2018-05-21 05:45:11 Check your Engine oil this Sunday.
9213 2018-05-21 05:45:03 Lorsqu’on songe à ce que l’Etat engrange grace à ce subterfuge de la pollution par le Diesel sur l’augmentation des taxes sur le Gas oil on est vraiment un peuple de gogos qui croit à tout ce qu’on lui dit au travers des médias et n’en voit pas les conséquences réelles ..!
9214 2018-05-21 05:44:48 Wait aren't oil prices rising right now?
9215 2018-05-21 05:44:47 changmin is truly such a sweet angel..his genuine heart of gold to do good & give back to society in wtv capacity he can has never changed..from volunteering during a massive oil spill disaster when he was young to helping little children today..he never stops giving back!! 
9216 2018-05-21 05:44:40 Evangelicals is this your idea of away to insure your tax free status because I believe this is reason enough to revoke that. you are no different than snake oil salesmen you take money from people for preaching this crap all of you should be removed from your church
9217 2018-05-21 05:44:31 Acc to @morganstanley one-third of the tax cut benefit to the US #consumer may have already been removed by the rise in #oil and #gasoline prices. #oott $spy $tlt $gld

 if you don’t have any of this oils you can use vaseline instead 
9220 2018-05-21 05:43:57 As a kid who lived the expat life until I went to college (oil company dad), my philosophy is if other countries, including allies, are happy with our prez, he’s doing it wrong.
9221 2018-05-21 05:43:42 Thanks for replying as in behalf of BJP Govt, then you must also explain why fuel prices in India remained high even after crude oil prices nose dived in 2014 until Dec2017, from as high as USD 140 to less than USD50? Forget about the growth which should’ve increased.

9224 2018-05-21 05:43:15 अगर oil कंपनिया price बढ़ाती हे। तो ये भी मोदी की गलती हे। अगर तुम्हारे जैशे oil की बर्बादी करनी छोड दे. और car के बजाये साइक्ले use या इलेक्ट्रिक स्कूटी चलाये तो । price will be decrease.
9225 2018-05-21 05:43:03 Sir, I tried all the flavours. The green one has too much of oil.
9226 2018-05-21 05:42:59 #FuelPriceHike
Petrol and Diesel reach a lifetime high. In 2013, crude oil was $150 a barrel, now it is around $70-75, still the petrol and diesel were cheaper in India that time then what they are today. Stop this loot in the name of excise duty and other taxes.
9227 2018-05-21 05:42:59 A combination of healthy demand, production cuts by oil cartel led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, drop in output from Venezuela and US decision to impose sanctions on Iran has led to the recent surge in oil price. But, what will the common man do???

9230 2018-05-21 05:42:21 Am i really gonna sit n listen to my nan and some woman discuss the oil prices all the way to the airport
9231 2018-05-21 05:42:16 Grace was when you have accepted defeat and would told governor we will sit in opposition whereas you burned midnight oil to grab power poor
9232 2018-05-21 05:42:11 We will be exporting oil and won’t have debt.  Maybe not even taxes.  
9233 2018-05-21 05:41:56 くっころ…
9234 2018-05-21 05:41:53 With oil prices rising and 100$ barrel a real possibility it is very brave to be shorting loonie...dont you think?
9235 2018-05-21 05:41:42 Cause there's no reason to constantly check your oil
9236 2018-05-21 05:41:41 Simply tweet what steps your government is taking to control rising oil prices. Asana's public can google.
9237 2018-05-21 05:41:38 try a salad with apple, carrot, red onion, hominy, arugula, baby spinach. Toss in olive oil and juice from a lime. Top with queso fresco, salt to taste.
9238 2018-05-21 05:41:37 Cambridge Analytica and Russia, it's all about their oil! Fraudulent election! Stop the Mercer's, Bannon, Nix, FB, and so many more.....corrupt Venezuala! @ananavarro
9239 2018-05-21 05:41:32 Sir Iska comparison international oil price se karna. Faltu ka logic, 2014 mein crude oil 120$ ke pass aur Aab 80$ ke paas. Ab comparison karo.
9240 2018-05-21 05:41:30 y’all wonder why countries are disgusted in the US government, meanwhile, every country we aren’t trying to deport people to, we’re invading for “political peacekeeping” reasons AKA oil domination
9241 2018-05-21 05:41:08 Why won't the media in America bring up the last two sham elections in Honduras? Because the right wing candidate won. Fraud was found during the Election. People marched. American trained security forces brutally suppressed them. US media not a peep. Palm oil is still cheap.
9242 2018-05-21 05:41:03 Koi bat nahi sir petrol 100 bhi ho jaye koi bat nahi kewal 28 rupees hi badhe hai dalo pe 100 rupe kam ho Gaye sugar pe 22 rupe kam ho Gaye hai aata 230 ka hai ab oil 80 to100 rupees hai sir petrol ke badhne se koi farq nahi parta
9243 2018-05-21 05:40:55 When the crude oil prices fall
Naseeb wala PM ensures fuel prices rise.

When elections are near
Naseeb wala PM ensures fuel ain't dear.

9254 2018-05-21 05:39:41 Here to say: savory oatmeal is AMAZING. Put some soy sauce, a dash of sesame oil, some walnuts or almonds or sesames for texture, some chopped scallions, and you’re golden. I add some hot sauce too!
9255 2018-05-21 05:39:31 Good debate showing. Your articulation of the ineffectiveness of pc & the dampening effect it has on the ability to discuss, is bang on. Pointing out the snake oil pulpit hucksterism of @MichaelEDyson was also very much needed.  Thank you.
9256 2018-05-21 05:39:31 Lol I’m not gonna ask a chef to change the oil in my car is all I’m saying
9257 2018-05-21 05:39:22 Exactly. 
People feel they’re being gouged because they do not have a choice but to pay for the higher gas price. We’ve built our cities with no choices.
Imagine how big oil would feel if they raised gas prices but got less money because enough people had alternative choices.
9258 2018-05-21 05:39:05 LOL - OK, when you said, "Having to use what's in place, thanks to decades of blocking out alternatives by the oil industry", when I was specifically talking about plastic kayaks, what did you really mean?

9265 2018-05-21 05:37:57 Before May 2014, the crude oil prices were at $140 barrel but the petrol was about Rs10 less than current prices. Today the crude oil prices are around $70. Bhakt ji

9278 2018-05-21 05:35:04 Dana Petroleum’s new North Sea discovery, Liberator,  could be worth more than £1billion.
The company will now firm up plans to produce oil together with nearby Blake Field.
Based on current prices, the site could be worth over £1billion. Prices were $100 and now $80. :-)

International prices were sky-high to rock bottom,Now again upwards.

Yes,govt collecting huge taxes over it & 100% I'm sure,spending on infra/defence/paying earlier govt pending oil bills.

But,govt hv to balance it, industries r suffering

9289 2018-05-21 05:32:57 My suggestion :-
if the perks allotted to the senior executive & above all managers/Director of all Oil Companies be reviewed immediately.
Definitely it will help to reduce the Price of Oil & Diesel and help the common man.
9290 2018-05-21 05:32:51 The recent rebound of crude oil rate has definitely made him more powerful.

9303 2018-05-21 05:31:03 You have to also look at the inflation too, Sixth pay commission increased salaries much more , hence increase in petrol price was justifiable , now govt. has been making a lot of money just by not giving benefit of low cost of oil to normal people

9317 2018-05-21 05:29:03 Whenever my car needs oil I usually just put it in, in the parking lot of whatever store I buy the oil at. My absolute favorite thing in the world is when random men stop me and ask if I need help putting the oil in...while I’m putting the oil in.

9324 2018-05-21 05:28:25 Also most of the oil we export now is not sweet crude, it's mostly shale and sand oil which just helps to keep the price of sweet crude higher
9325 2018-05-21 05:28:17 Motor oil or cooking oil?
9326 2018-05-21 05:28:02 Taking duration=X

9341 2018-05-21 05:24:54 Russian’s also starved in the 90’s when Russia was being run out of the American embassy. If you think America runnig Venezuela will mean the people won’t starve just shows how naive you are. The US only cares about getting oil cheap, not the wellbeing of the locals. Proven fact.
9342 2018-05-21 05:24:54 2/2 all the big US producers laid off their production and geology people, thereby saving millions on top of costs for workers and environmental compensation. This allowed them to buy middle east oil at best price because they provide the tech, and make more profit.
9343 2018-05-21 05:24:34 How do you figure that? I said "Try making a plastic kayak out of water instead of oil sometime, you raging hypocrite." And you replied:

9381 2018-05-21 05:18:48 That is basically correct but in my opinion what comes in to play is the big oil companies and the carbon tax scheme, historically the US was the world's largest producer of 'Sweet' crude oil until large deposits were found in the middle east when it became cheaper to import  1/2

9465 2018-05-21 05:02:47 We got a defuser today and put lavender oil in it, my room smells amazing and I’m so relaxed.
9466 2018-05-21 05:02:47 Are you illiterate or not reading paper, every day print media publishing international crude oil rates rise and every citizens are aware of the fact.
9467 2018-05-21 05:02:21 News at 11: Idiots still read "ban" instead of "regulation" and think knives are as dangerous as guns. Stay tuned for a rebuttal about closed doors and a centuries old amendment that in no way reflects our current society. Facts: gun ownership should be earned, not a right!

9473 2018-05-21 05:01:18 Nigeria has oil and gas. Nigeria has precious gems.
You all should be rolling in money and living a great life, better than most people.

There is no need for poverty in Nigeria.
You all need to rise up against corruption 
Make Nigeria Great !
9474 2018-05-21 05:01:18 Oh no black oil maybe you got abducted and don’t know it@FaithSwan
9475 2018-05-21 05:01:10 Marco you are a trash puppy that does not represent democracy at home or abroad, you just want the oil money, you don't care about democracy
9476 2018-05-21 05:01:04 @GovernorNanok why on earth would you accept a 25% of oil revenue?? You don't even have laws in place to safeguard this?? By the time you realize MLICHESWA, Turkana will be in turmoil and it will be too late. Take this tweet serious GOVERNOR
9477 2018-05-21 05:01:02 Fuel prices depend on crude oil prices, the rupee $ exchange rate and local taxes. Both crude oil prices and $ are higher and govt has limited control on that. Hence the govt should lower the very high existing taxes on petrol and diesel.
9478 2018-05-21 05:00:54 Not checked but read it somewhere that we import 80% of oil from Iran only. Any idea on special benefits from the deal? I remember, payment was agreed in rupees instead of dollars during MMS time. 
Also, why is indian basket going up drastically as compared to say brent?

9488 2018-05-21 04:59:59 The U.K. is fighting its own battle with #oil and #fracking - it is those in the #conservative govt. that are not ready. #KinderMorgan #oiljobs #greenjobs

9490 2018-05-21 04:59:51 i haven't had much of an issue with acne so idk how good it works for that, but if it controls oil i think it'll control acne too
9491 2018-05-21 04:59:38 May cruide oil raise to 100$ , wht will happen?
9492 2018-05-21 04:59:35 This is also the current report the gov of Canada has referred to the BC gov.

Dilbit in a marine environment behaves in a very similar manner to crude oil. As discussed in the research, dlibit is slightly stickier than crude so forms OPAs slightly more effectively than crude.
9493 2018-05-21 04:59:31 I put too much coconut oil in my hair and now it's greasy and flat looking. Help

1.Lowest Export growth in last 18 months.
2.Impact of rising crude oil prices
3.Rising prices of basic metals.
9496 2018-05-21 04:58:59 Since I can't sleep I think I will look up oil and hair vitamins since my hair ain't growing back fast enough
9497 2018-05-21 04:58:53 Baba we need to EPP ourselves
9498 2018-05-21 04:58:51 Maha aghaori  adami , pedhe to acha khasa ho per baatein jhailo waali hi karoge. Crude oil was 29$ /barrel in 14-15 now it is. $80/barrel , it is because of international market and OPEC country  is producing less.
9499 2018-05-21 04:58:25 Torrid times ahead for all Venezuelans. Country is bankrupt, poor starving and infra-structure collapsed. Elections most likely rigged as well. China can colonise another country with oil.

9503 2018-05-21 04:57:20 Thank you Seattle & Washington state for protesting against Kinder Morgan pipeline. The Nathan E Stewart was under contract to Kinder Morgan in 2015 & 16 & twice within one year had disasters. Once lost power in a storm with a barge full of oil & the 2nd time ran aground & sank.
9504 2018-05-21 04:57:19 Highest i remember paying for petrol in Pune was 81 rupees during upa wen oil was 130 usd barrel now yesterday i filled 84.25 rupees.. #achedin
9505 2018-05-21 04:56:39 OIL POLLUTION is another big threat to sea turtles. It can both impact the turtle as well as the food it eats. Pollution contaminates the water and kills off aquatic plants and life. This causes their food supply to be very small making it harder to survive. #seaturtles
9506 2018-05-21 04:56:27 A majority of trump supporters, not a majority of all sane Americans. That's called gaslighting, and trump is a master snake oil salesman.
9507 2018-05-21 04:56:20 Agreed Chetan that taxes shud be cut down.
Tell me one thing, 3 months back crude oil prices were much lower but that time also oil prices here were very high ?
9508 2018-05-21 04:56:16 When the crude oil price was less the government didn’t lower the fuel price,you must be aware of it.
9509 2018-05-21 04:56:08 Right. But the parts to make that bike, the food you eat and the energy you consume mostly come from oil use.
9510 2018-05-21 04:55:47 Trying to make better choices.  Chicken without skin.  A bit of olive oil and spices then backed.  Made salad with homemade oil vinegar and spices. Flavor out of this world.  Will post recipes soon.
9511 2018-05-21 04:55:16 My mom used to do a meat fondu ..different cuts of meat, put in hot oil..Yummmmmy.
9512 2018-05-21 04:55:13 I have combo skin and coconut oil is more of a sealant than actually adding moisture, at least from what I’ve read. I tried it too and it led me to having horrible tiny pumps and ruining my texture. Or I could be allergic ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

9515 2018-05-21 04:54:47 Still can’t believe tatcha sells a face oil that’s literally just camellia oil with gold in it and charges almost a hundred dollars for it when 1) gold isn’t good for ur skin and 2) camellia oil is SO FUCKING AFFORDABLE if you just buy it on its own
9516 2018-05-21 04:54:39 Making a fool of oneself is something koi aap se sikhe. When you commented in 2013-14 on high petrol prices, crude oil was hovering around $140 a barrel. Today it's about $70 per barrel. Go figure if taxes alone are responsible or Modi's mismanagement too?
9517 2018-05-21 04:54:36 He also told us not to let him down on Destiel oil rig fanfiction and was excited about a western slash romcom with Misha. Late 2017-early 2018 was a good year.
9518 2018-05-21 04:54:30 The Muslim Medieval's have done almost nothing else except plunder each other over oil!  Countless millions died.
9519 2018-05-21 04:54:16 Oooh is that oil paint?
It looks so rigid and layered.
I love this.
9520 2018-05-21 04:54:02 It's good to see people intensely explaining international oil businesses and economy to defend petrol prices. I wish one of those who are obsessed with the glorious past of India could have invented vehicles which ran without petrol.

9545 2018-05-21 04:49:43 We lose jobs due to bad trade deals to everyone and you try to protect our old oil tech = middling short term plan. You have no plan to safeguard against this industry’s eventual demise.  You may have a 2 year plan but everyone knows we need a 20 year plan.  #patriotsnotpolitics
9546 2018-05-21 04:49:38 Could this be the week of 30th round news for #i3e? We might see US oil sanctions against Venezuela today...a good time to secure low risk resources in the north sea.

9551 2018-05-21 04:49:23 You don't know what I care about, get real. You tell people to not eat animals because it kills them,  but will support other things that harms and kills animals in other ways (gasoline 
use,  oil spills ect) and also costs human lives as well. U have nerve calling out others.

9568 2018-05-21 04:46:38 International crude oil prices could go much higher and INR could weaken in near term.
9569 2018-05-21 04:46:38 #FuelPriceHike
I think it’s simple, there is no subsidy. The prices go up and down in conjunction to the everyday oil prices in the international market.

9571 2018-05-21 04:46:12 People were abusing ManmohaN Singh govt for oil prices which was providing it at unbelievably low prices when International rates were skyrocketing. Now Bhakts are finding excuse in International crude prices for Govt's failure to control rates in India. #petrolpricehike
9572 2018-05-21 04:46:04 Please don't give us that rubbish. We're not talking of subsidies - only about reduction of excise which was raised earlier to increase revenues during fall in international prices of oil!
9573 2018-05-21 04:46:01 @INCIndia investigate the economics of decision...be assured a change on taxation on oil price would be hit. Is economy overly dependent on oil taxes

9597 2018-05-21 04:42:23 I bring up the Oilers b/c so many decided to use the players stopped trying narrative to explain their season, when nothing could've been further from the truth.
9598 2018-05-21 04:42:04 Since  crude oil  has reached  80$ in international markets. What  do u expect  from government
9599 2018-05-21 04:42:02 Baby oil or Coconat oil + new razor = happy vajayjay
9600 2018-05-21 04:42:02 Serious hypocrites in your petroleum product boats and oil fueled transportation .
9601 2018-05-21 04:41:45 the oil on that damn pillar made me smell like lube for a week
9602 2018-05-21 04:41:29 7. Drop the three to four triangles into the hot oil. If the oil is hot enough the dough will quickly float to the top and puff up. Turn da mahamri as soon as it is a light brown n' turn. Cook on the other side for another min. N' remove from the deep fryer with a slated spoon.

9607 2018-05-21 04:40:11 Even the machines that require oil, including electric generation, were discovered, built and sold by The West.

9614 2018-05-21 04:39:34 I thought tea tree oil was toxic for rabbits?
9615 2018-05-21 04:39:32 First, when the crude oil was all time low. Why did we not get the benefit, they way we are being charged now? Second, on what basis, do you say that govt has limited control on ₹$ rate? Seriously??
9616 2018-05-21 04:39:04 「君のことを愛している。だから僕のものになってくれ！」みたいな理論を聞くと「オ゛オ゛ン゛！？！？！？」となってしまう厄介オタク(愛を要求に使うな)(愛の定義が解釈違いです)

9618 2018-05-21 04:38:55 Mr Avenatti has been as accurate as the Steele Dossier. 
Neither has stated a falsehood. 
Many things of both have been affirmed and confirmed. 
The latest fact to be confirmed was the 19% of Rosneft purchase (Russian oil/gas conglomerate) by Qatar.

9625 2018-05-21 04:37:50 He had no politically legal way to do that. The oil there, like the vast lakes of oil the Saudis enjoy, were discovered and mined by The West.
9626 2018-05-21 04:37:37 @cnbcSri @dan_murphy Goodmorning i think the more we go , the more situations provide with oil to go up! but it is interesting that this is happening in parallel with EM currencies devaluation and USD increase!
9627 2018-05-21 04:37:16 ## Government of India as well as non Oil Producing Countries must put pressure upon OPEC Countries to lower down cost of Brent Crude Oil Price. Otherwise Economy of many Developing Countries will be jeopardised.

9632 2018-05-21 04:36:48 I think Mr Jeneroux & all CPC's have a comprehension problem.What the Libs are saying is that Conservs have built zero pipelines to "new markets".All our oil going to the US where we get rebate price for itThat is a FACT,not a talking point.We need to get better than US price.
9633 2018-05-21 04:36:46 Yes. One more decision was to deregulate the oil prices for the so called "VIKAS" of the nation.

One more fantastic decision was to give multi crore loan waivers so that u do not lose your vote bank. @PMOIndia @narendramodi @RBI @PTI_News #dirtypolitics
9634 2018-05-21 04:36:39 There is a solution to this problem. Do the math. It is only right that Venezuela should pay off their debt to China. If the South American country's oil industry is booming, then Venezuela needs to use the money they make from the oil to repay China 100%.
9635 2018-05-21 04:36:25 Wars are rarely fought by armies.
We are, and have been, in a long war with Europe. EU formed to compete with our economy & Euro currency to woo it as a money to trade oil (big $ stuff)
Everything else is just PR and dying cartels begging for easy American dollars. Boo hoo

9636 2018-05-21 04:36:12 We use canola oil

9638 2018-05-21 04:35:57 Two weeks later Novak then announced that Russia had put together an oil-for-goods program with Iran and confirmed that the first shipments had been made. The deal aims for five years of trading and gets around the USD trade. -True Publica
9639 2018-05-21 04:35:51 UPA issued oil bonds to OMCs...
Which will mature after few years.
Who will pay for them ?
Also they didn't do much for the infrastructure like this govt. Which is using the money to good use.
Double whammy !!
9640 2018-05-21 04:35:42 Nothing going to happen at embassy level. Try approaching mam swaraj or NaMo. They have to take personal interest in this. Now that oil prices hv gone up, full gratuity should be given as per contract. All the best.
9641 2018-05-21 04:35:30 Come on Todd. For a company that just got a huge infusion of cash from BP and Total - two massive oil companies - it seems odd to claim somebody from Sierra Club works for Big Oil. Evan and Todd, put your swords down for the night, and we’ll battle this out in the coming weeks.
9642 2018-05-21 04:35:29 Cedarwood oil has become my nighttime fave

9648 2018-05-21 04:34:22 3/I've written extensively about why majors have left the oil sands: Shell is shifting to natgas to lower carbon-intensity of its portfolio, plus bought BG Group for $50B in 2016, publicly said it would sell $30B of assets to pay for the purchase
9649 2018-05-21 04:34:16 josh is trying my noxema to see if it'll control his oil better overnight so his CPAP works better, lol
9650 2018-05-21 04:33:44 You guys should really collaborate
9651 2018-05-21 04:33:38 It's poor politics & bad economics.poor politics as BJP shouted from the rooftops when UPA raised prices when Brent was actually over $100 per barrel.bad economics coz govt is forced to milk oil to cover up for revenue shortfall elsewhere.
9652 2018-05-21 04:33:37 They know that market forces are the best thing to guide the economy. Unless we're talking about subsidising private health insurers, oil and gas exploration, restricting spending of charity organisations, over-funding private schools, the CGT discount and on it goes...

9656 2018-05-21 04:33:11 Having to use what's in place, thanks to decades of blocking out alternatives by the oil industry, isn't our issue. That's just another thing we have to evolve from. Try to think a little bigger.

9696 2018-05-21 04:26:36 It's not a matter of legal force,  BC is likely to prevail again at the SCoC.  It's a matter of political will and BC is still a ways away from banning all heavy oil tanker traffic, only because the NDP secretly loves pipelines and energy exports as much as the BC Libs.
9697 2018-05-21 04:26:23 Coconut oil after a shower is essential for smooth skin 
9698 2018-05-21 04:26:23 That’s pretty much what I stated on Facebook a few days ago, because cutting the flow of oil to BC is just what they want. I think Both BC and Alberta NDP are working together for their UN agenda, while wearing opposing masks in public.

9703 2018-05-21 04:25:28 So in June we'll be starting to export our oil. An agreement has been reached between the govt and county of Turkana. The government takes 75% while the county gets 20%. Don't ask me who gets the 5%.
9704 2018-05-21 04:25:17 Friend. Our market in Finland is bad, but I like  a product that contains simethicone and peppermint oil. For those days when can’t control my meals and when I’m sitting down a lot. No side effects that I’ve noticed.

9708 2018-05-21 04:24:29 It is not entirely more of it is becz of crude oil  n rising dollar.!  Mkt is just a little nervous as it does not like coalition government because it lacks stability in policy making fun 2019 point of view
9709 2018-05-21 04:24:21 I refer to President Barack Obama as Americans LAST (always capitalized) great president because the electorate

-Refuses to do its homework
-Believes the worst about good candidates 
 And he media goes for ratings over substance
9710 2018-05-21 04:23:59 I literally cried about pulling the plug in the tub last night because I loved my @lushcosmetics bath oil too much and I didn’t want to watch it go down the drain because somehow it felt like murder. I’m too soft to be alive at this point.
9711 2018-05-21 04:23:47 But when the crude oil price was at it's lowest value than in our country the price of petrol and diesel was was very high.....they can relax the highest excise duty from petroliam product...and VAT levied by the state government.
9712 2018-05-21 04:23:35 I decided to put some lavender oil in my mist humidifier and ... oh man I feel so sleepy. I didn’t think it would work but damn.

9715 2018-05-21 04:23:28 It's possible to be for the use of oil in the production of plastics and be against it for fuel - advocates for moderation exist. 

not to mention that most plastics use natural gas as a feedstock - not oil

9718 2018-05-21 04:23:17 on Friday me and @homieggg we’re walking to school and on the way there there was this this big ass jug of grapeseed oil and it was empty. i mean it was big and we just wondered who tf needed that much grapeseed oil
9719 2018-05-21 04:23:03 But the budget did not envisage the skyrocketing of crude oil prices and the advalorem levy of excise duty brings a windfall gain to the Government every time the price goes up. This is certainly not budgeted. Right ?

9726 2018-05-21 04:21:42 When boiling water and it starts foaming over, pour in some olive oil. Just a bit. It'll make the overflowing go away.
9727 2018-05-21 04:21:37 As the #oilprice climbs over $80 (its highest level for 4yrs) those analysts & commentators who frame all #globalpolitics as the 'great game' of #oil will be convinced (perhaps correctly) that all #POTUSTrump's actions are driven by the 'needs' of his chums in the #oilindustry
9728 2018-05-21 04:21:31 I'm still recovering when jungkook lifted his shirt
9729 2018-05-21 04:21:29 In 2013 the crude oil prices were arnd 92 a barrel,today it is arnd 76 a barrel!
Petrol price in 2013 was 76/litr and today it is 84/litr! 
And the govt is fooling us again,giving an excuse of hike in crude oil prices!

9736 2018-05-21 04:20:33 1/The reason people like my comments, sir, is that I'm an energy journalist who reports extensively about the oil sands. I take care with my facts, unlike you. And I disclose any conflicts of interest, unlike you. I protect my integrity, unlike you.
9737 2018-05-21 04:20:25 Their oil industry is what drives their economy, their economy is what makes Venezuelan lives better, hitting them with sanctions means indirectly hitting the Venezuelan on the street, who feel the punch more, leading to hunger the crying then death!
9738 2018-05-21 04:20:16 Government doesn't know how to control......the factors involved in rising of commodity n crude oil prices can't be controlled by jumla....it needs skill, education, expertise, knowledge of economics, will power..
9739 2018-05-21 04:20:09 Since it wasn't a met ward experiment, we have to hold some skepticism, but if this were replicated in a ward trial it would have interesting implications, my guess is the cals in the std. oil group were higher.

9744 2018-05-21 04:19:45 Ok so using that logic,  you should stop using gas in your vehicle because thousands die working in the oil industry every year. Go watch videos of them dying. Stop eating chocolate,  because of the child slave labor involved. Go watch a video of them being mistreated. You wont.
9745 2018-05-21 04:19:41 Companies are free to fix prices. Hai Na!
But who owns the oil companies? Govt? No?.

9747 2018-05-21 04:19:26 Houston? The mayor is black, and due to the minority of whites here most police officers and security guards are actually black or hispanic.

As for big business owners and CEO’s, due to the oil industry and proximity to Mexico the makeup is largely wealthy foreigners.

9750 2018-05-21 04:19:06 How About You Demand Lower Oil Prices ? Gas is at its highest in 4 years - @realDonaldTrump  Do Something !
9751 2018-05-21 04:18:53 No loss to OMCs as of now due to surge in Crude prices. Socialism will be back at work soon. @ONGC_ @gailindia & OIL will be asked to cough up the subsidies (if any).....same as UPA times. This is 56” Govt! Buy OMCs’ shares and sell ONGC @ravi4354
9752 2018-05-21 04:18:48 The earlier 120$ per barrel of crude prices caused the emergence of the shale industry. If oil never crossed 100$ a barrel earlier, there wouldn't have been a shale industry. Then  shale extraction break even was at around 70-80$ odd. Now it's more optimised the breakeven is 50$.

9755 2018-05-21 04:18:28 You need to see a stylist get a scalp treatment and try using redken scalp relief it’s a white bottle it will help also tea tree oil or shampoo
9756 2018-05-21 04:18:06 I've often thought that a terrific improvathon could be set in Midsomer (copyright permitting). A chef once tied a rival to a tree, covered him in truffle oil then let the wild boar loose - could it get any better?
9757 2018-05-21 04:18:01 This is also concurrent with the sudden fear of saturated fat and its replacement with vegetable oils like margarine, corn oil, etc.
9758 2018-05-21 04:17:48 But this was a oil swap that resulted in a weight decrease... with no differences in calorie counting or thermodynamic monitoring right?

9762 2018-05-21 04:17:27 Same here.. it’s def that time of the year. U could try a diffuser (amzn, sfm, Whole Foods will have them) at home. I diffuse tea tree oil, eucalyptus, peppermint and lemon.. which surprisingly helps.. sending lots of prayers ur way!
9763 2018-05-21 04:17:25 Can @realDonaldTrump stop the import of Venezuelan oil by executive action? That could account for @marcorubio's cocky tweets.

And it will actually bring the current government down, perhaps within weeks.

9769 2018-05-21 04:16:47 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
9770 2018-05-21 04:16:46 You should have disclosed the nature of your firm's investment portfolio somewhere in that op-ed. For instance, Glass Point is operating in Oman helping produce heavy crude oil that is potentially a competitor of oil sands crude shipped from TMX. Conflict of interest much?!?
9771 2018-05-21 04:16:45 So I'm thinking an oil/shower show on Tuesday and a cum show on Wednesday. I'll also be on tomorrow but not sure for how long 
9772 2018-05-21 04:16:37 Even if it goes to 100$, it's not going to remain there for long. Shale Oil extraction has higher costs than regular crude. So as oil prices go up, shale becomes more profitable. And shale isn't under a cartel like regular oil - so it will be a counter to oil prices.
9773 2018-05-21 04:16:30 Or they better find oil
So that the petrol prices come down
9774 2018-05-21 04:16:26 I use like 1tbsp of oil for the eggs, and maybe 3 for the veggies before the cauliflower joins the party.

9778 2018-05-21 04:15:51 I don't think so, any reduction of taxes on fuel shall have direct affect on development, already government controlled the prices during election. Rising petrol prices can be an opposition issue, but in a free market, control is at the cost of development, unlike oil countries.

9823 2018-05-21 04:09:53 When the crude oil prices were going down the Indian Government was continuously increasing taxes so that the price of petroleum products does not fall. When the price is rising in global markets is the Government not duty bound to reduce taxes to control the prices. When to act

9845 2018-05-21 04:05:11 The US military consumes around 19 million oil barrels a day. At around $50 a barrel, that’s $950,000,000 spent in JUST ONE DAY. This is why the government needs to find a better way to allocate it’s budget.

9853 2018-05-21 04:04:07 Higher gas prices are bad for US, but good for  RUS as they cannot compete with cheaper suppliers having tapped roughly 80% of their reserves.

Will try to go to bed early
And am honestly trying to do the best I can

9865 2018-05-21 04:02:50 You are willfully ignorant Stacy Jo, & there is no way to penetrate that. No facts, reason, data or even an appeal to your better angels will sway you from blindly following a common snake oil selling carnival barker. Sadly he doesn't care about you. He cares only about himself.
9866 2018-05-21 04:02:32 What "Solution". You go on manufacturing more cars, Some have more money to buy.We are not "Oil producing country". More than 90 % imported. Money shld be used for Farmers, Fertilizers , homes & Tolilets.
9867 2018-05-21 04:02:29 Corruption in DOT/PCOO, Boracay Chinese Casino, Kuwait and DFA brouhaha, Chinese Missile planes in WPS, Big time oil price hike, Pdutz not voting during BRGY elections,

9888 2018-05-21 03:59:44 Is this the new phenomenon or year long formula that was existing??
As per this formula, why didn't it go down when the crude oil price was lesser...

9890 2018-05-21 03:59:31 The Altona Refinery is a blight on the West of Melbourne. Spewing pollution and odours 24 hours a day, ruining the air quality for 100,000s of people for the benefit of a multinational oil company. Fossil fuels are a dying industry and the sooner the refinery closes the better.
9891 2018-05-21 03:59:26 Trade wars are good and easy to win. Reneging on treaty obligations with, and threatening sanctions upon, a major oil producing country also works wonders.

9898 2018-05-21 03:58:48 and to@politicalham: Facts or fiction is the title of my article. Fact: many international oil executives and investors are not out to lunch, they are out of Alberta. Reason: cost driven by shale and renewables opportunities elsewhere. StatOil even changed it name to Equinor.
9899 2018-05-21 03:58:39 Well this articulation is not that much fairer coz there are a lot of other key issues and the frontier one is meeting of OPEC countries who though can decrease production capacity and it can harm in oil pricing ,NSG can be a issue,trade war is,pak/afgan,chabhar,northern corridor
9900 2018-05-21 03:58:29 No they don't. We have regulations now and they've been found to be flawed. Simply put, your not going to rid the world of guns. The more law abiding citizens that have them, the safer children will be. Criminals won't obey bans. Look at the drug and ban and how well that's gone.

9907 2018-05-21 03:57:55 Oil price is cyclical. There will be ups and downs. But imposing sanctions during the down cycle to incite regime change? Can US justify punishing the Venezuelan people because they choose to be independent? I guess they can
9908 2018-05-21 03:57:44 This is a dumb take. Also what brand of motor oil do you use on your hair?

9915 2018-05-21 03:56:39 More sanctions are on the way against the nations oil industry.
9916 2018-05-21 03:56:34 How about the fact that oil and gas companies new about climate change for years and withheld crucial information?
9917 2018-05-21 03:56:29 #PetrolPrices in #India soaring high due to heavy taxation, why can’t governments reduce taxes and pass on the cheaper oil prices for people  ? Yeah but #Modi wants money for advertising, paying for #TrollArmies to keep #Bhakts feel good. #Mitron feel it when u pay for petrol....

9920 2018-05-21 03:56:12 you using butter AND olive oil damn son really living large with them cooking fats
9921 2018-05-21 03:56:11 @narendramodi Respected Sir, it was so sad to read about the rising crude oil prices and also that it is going to rise further in future only adds as a dampener. Still can’t understand why it can’t be brought under GST net to get some relief
9922 2018-05-21 03:55:52 Oil price drop during GFC was the trigger but it was further exacerbated by US sanctions. Similar to what happened to China during Great Leap Forward. Instead of helping US just stabbed Venezuela. Regime change is the objective.
9923 2018-05-21 03:55:37 イケメンは愛でるのです( ・∇・)
9924 2018-05-21 03:55:29 It is absolutely acceptable but that hasn't happened. In your view the US is forced to buy oil from a dictator that shows animosity and co tinuously threatens it?
9925 2018-05-21 03:55:29 Shallots in butter and olive oil >>>>
9926 2018-05-21 03:55:24 It's simple mam bring fuel under GST. petrol ll become RS.58 becoz of GST govt earned 90k cr to 1.29lakhs every month, they can adjust vit petroleum. Remove corrupted ppl in oil industry appoint ppl like Manish sisodia to drive the change.
9927 2018-05-21 03:55:21 From the report you wanted me to read.  "The main knowledge gap identified in these reports was the lack of data on the of fate, behaviour and environmental effects of the full range of oil types, including diluted bitumen." #StopKM #climateaction
9928 2018-05-21 03:54:33 As always, I got hungry before bed on the day I didn't get groceries.

9930 2018-05-21 03:54:23 They don’t have enough oil to satisfy us, that’s why
9931 2018-05-21 03:54:12 Since 2014, what was the crude oil price?? It was hovering around 35-40$ but petrol prices were still higher...why dont they bring petrol diesel under GST?? BJP rule in 21 states and center if they still cant do it then it is better to shoe them out in 2019 what say bhagat??
9932 2018-05-21 03:54:11 In fact just the opposite can be stated, US has kept the regime going by buying the Venezuelan oil

9937 2018-05-21 03:53:48 Koi ye bhi bta rha hoga ki UPA ne Iran se oil loan liya tha ..Uski bharpayi kar rhe hain..Kaha se laate hain ye logic..
9938 2018-05-21 03:53:36 Someone must explain it to the fools that India as on today can't afford to lower the taxes firstly due high dues to Iran as tue UPA govt didn't make the payment against the oil imported during last 10 years also for half of the tax on oil are from state govt...
9939 2018-05-21 03:53:35 Not really the case which u explained.. means when crude oil price was low the rate shld b low in India. But at that tym govt was explaining d losses accured by the oil companies... Fact is that it's no more for public it's more of business n profit.
9940 2018-05-21 03:53:31 High tax is needed. Pinching price forces people to consume less and look for alternative energy. Why companies are not release more efficient e-cars? The oil mafia blocking?
9941 2018-05-21 03:53:18 I love how the price of fuel mysteriously goes up one month before summer. 

Oil companies are are worse than the dresses worn by Jehova’s Witness women wanting to talk about their Savior.

9946 2018-05-21 03:52:42 Yes, he flew from England to other points in Europe to bomb the Nazis. He also bombed targets in Romania - the oil fields. He made it with his crew but they had a lot of scary encounters along the way.
9947 2018-05-21 03:52:34 It targeted PVDSA as well, by association. Look at impact on oil revenues from the US. And also light oil import that Venezuela need for refining.  Sorry but these are visible impacts. Go do some research.
9948 2018-05-21 03:52:08 I don’t expect passenger airlines wanting to reinstate 747s at US$80 a barrel for oil
9949 2018-05-21 03:52:08 Do Nothing? It's on the schools and local politicians to secure the schools. That will reduce the risks the most. If the next one happens, it will be because of a lack of action on their part to make the schools themselves safer.
9950 2018-05-21 03:52:06 I love the way coconut oil makes my hair smell
9951 2018-05-21 03:52:06 Took me a few readings to realize it wasn’t a “cooking oil erection”, not that I could figure out what that is.
9952 2018-05-21 03:51:59 Wy it was so high even when the Crude oil prices are beliw 50$. Either this government doesnot understand evonomics or filling up the BJP coffers to win election and later on buy MLAs ?
9953 2018-05-21 03:51:52 How about we plan regime change in @KSA2996 , I mean they behead people, support terrorism, kills Yemenis? Lets find another weapons market, let's find another Oil suppliers. Iran is not our enemy!
9954 2018-05-21 03:51:45 no lmao which is weird. my skin be feeling smooth. when I put on lotion I feel like an oil bag

9956 2018-05-21 03:51:17 Just answer one question without any statistics. How come Manmohan Singh govt fixed petrol prices at 64/- when the crude oil prices were at $120. Secondly how come the present govt maintained the prices when the crude oil went down to $30/-

9961 2018-05-21 03:50:42 We know your respect —— Manmohan Singh ordinance on corruption, what did you do with it??? We know your respect for institutions in India, we know your respect when you abuse a democratically elected prime minister of this country ... so go pedal your snake oil gyan to your piddi

9964 2018-05-21 03:50:26 I have come to know ants cannot stand the odor of petroleum products.

Specially if they are leaf-cutters.

9966 2018-05-21 03:50:09 The real crisis began when oil prices drop but the economy destruction (literally) its start when Chavez ruled. I saw it with my own eyes.

9970 2018-05-21 03:49:41 Question. If you got your way, and all guns in the US were banned, are you then prepared to ban their replacements like London has with knives? You haven't solved the problem, you only made it easier for criminals.
9971 2018-05-21 03:49:32 Mask. I wash my face with the African black soap, then I put the aloe Vera on, let it dry and moisturize with shea butter, or coconut oil. I don’t wash it off, unless I’m in a hurry

9980 2018-05-21 03:48:10 During the UPA period when oil prices were going high the BJP  MPs in Parliament made ruckus & stalled working. Wanted prices reduced & taxes removed. Now why not abolish all taxes?

9986 2018-05-21 03:47:10 The share price in past few months of HP, Indian Oil are going to low. Where the another country raise the value of petrol already. Like Dubai, US , Kueat etc. Whatever it is the bad news for last level cosumer, but actually it is correct by the way of finance, not politics.
9987 2018-05-21 03:47:09 Looks like Horgan will make BCers buy Trump oil at a price much higher than AB is selling their oil to the US. Typical NDP economic logic. @SheilaGunnReid @TheRebelTV
9988 2018-05-21 03:47:09 Just bring fuel under GST of 18% bracket petrol ll become Rs.58 diesel ll become Rs.52.5. you can keep constant crude oil price of $ 80. See the break even every six months n increase for the lossed amount?
9989 2018-05-21 03:47:02 @PRyan is so bought and paid for! NRA, Big Oil, Big Insurance. He pushed thru a fiscally RECKLESS #taxScam bill because he's a KOCH WHORE!!

9996 2018-05-21 03:45:38 You didn’t “like” two tweets today sent to me incorrectly stating the immigration from the US to Canada is not illegal? You did not state that oil companies are largely foreign owned and thus don’t deserve support?

10000 2018-05-21 03:45:24 Ideals our politicians follow are petty parody of greed for money & power. Nothing much, nothing less. Evident they are feeding on ignorance of uneducated & poor. Snake oil sellers don't last, but we've got lots. Nepal needs #education to rid of this pests & #soonWewill together

10002 2018-05-21 03:44:54 This can't happen in Uganda boss. In Uganda oil belongs to M7 and clique. Kenya has very strong institutions that keep improving themselves all the time. Uganda is a dictatorship, a failed state
10003 2018-05-21 03:44:43 I normally cook in it, then while its hot put some water in it, scrub it after its cooler, then paper towel it with a lil oil
10004 2018-05-21 03:44:34 I vaped THC oil recently.  Felt like HELL coughing my lungs up! Too heck with vaping anything!
10005 2018-05-21 03:44:25 You forgot to write -“I beg to state that” or don’t take me wrong “ before giving suggestion to govt. 
What was crude oil price and dollar price when you tweeted financial crisis during UPA? Double standard?

10009 2018-05-21 03:44:11 Thanks! Saved! Quantity looks like enough to feed at least 5! I made some fried eggplant 'cause was in the mood. Old family recipe-you bread it by dipping in whisked eggs followed by bread crumbs. Then, heat olive oil stovetop on med-hi heat, fry up and lightly salt. Saute garlic
