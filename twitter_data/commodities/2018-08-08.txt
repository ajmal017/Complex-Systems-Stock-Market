41 2018-08-08 21:06:54 I understand this to be a "one year cap" -- which means no more licenses will be issued.  In the interim, the number has to be studied. But medallions are artificial commodities.  Nothing about the legislation says that future licenses have to be worth any amount of money.

59 2018-08-08 19:40:11 It seems that there is no control over prices of commodities! Prices went up. To add insult to injury they also reduced the size of packings to give lesser quantities! What is this hey? Why do British people accept this daylight robbery!??

71 2018-08-08 18:24:11 "people seeing artists as commodities" - that's *absolutely* what it is. they're no longer human beings to a lot of their audience, just brands expected to come up with a certain product, and preferably fast.

73 2018-08-08 18:16:49 So you’re trading commodities? That’s cool...we need more of our people trading and investing.
74 2018-08-08 18:11:23 Yeah, exactly. It comes back to people seeing artists and people in general as commodities. It's awful how selfish some people are. They believe they own the artist just because they helped them (presumably) to be successful. Forget anything else, just entertain me 
75 2018-08-08 18:11:00 It's not about Social Media platforms and the #1A as much as it is the changing of the TOS ("contract") in midstream. Isn't that a breach of "contract"? After all, they're publicly traded commodities based on user contracts, right? Isn't that legitimate for class action lawsuit?
76 2018-08-08 18:02:54 Canadian commodities sell in open markets, they will be picked up by other buyers in the market for the same price.

91 2018-08-08 17:13:12 1) Attention, the false accusers who get motivated by attention seek to have the largest audience for the longest possible time period. Once their fame from the accusation fades they often want to show off the commodities they bought with the the money to keep attention on them.

96 2018-08-08 16:53:10 The root of confusion and illusions in Siphamandla is the romance he has with the notion of the market and scarcity. It is common misconception of inability of bourgeois economics to grasp that commodities can be consumed outside market, but in social.
97 2018-08-08 16:45:00 Capitalism's tendency to eviscerate whole collectives of people and then criminalize them for performing the predictable outcomes of that evisceration, is one of the instrumental pathologies that fuels the production of prisoners as commodities, namely poor people of color.
98 2018-08-08 16:43:01 O que causou o crescimento da era Lula foi a alta do preço das commodities, o resto é consequência. Em relação a proposta: populismo, para limpar o nome e reduzir a inadimplência tem que aumentar o emprego, que é o objetivo de todos os candidatos

101 2018-08-08 16:31:13 @LukeGromen As usual commodity investors try to justify why prices move.

105 2018-08-08 16:20:06 Trade actions "create arbitrage opportunities," in commodities, says #Glencore CEO. "Trade wars haven’t really kicked in yet, so therefore we haven’t really started taking advantage, if the advantages are there."
106 2018-08-08 16:09:50 He said $BTC, not crypto in general. If the crypto is deemed a security, then yes, it should be bought and sold on licensed, regulated exchanges only. If it is $BTC, then it is more akin to a commodity like gold. Since when is it illegal to conduct private sales of commodities?
107 2018-08-08 15:59:27 I want 2 believe u understand the fact that everything be it product or raw material has a life-span.

109 2018-08-08 15:44:46 Not quite right Jordan. Drugs and sex are treated as commodities by people no matter the society. Always have been. Socialism doesn't remove this. Capitalism doesn't destroy immorality or base desires. It just says that people must be free from control by others.

113 2018-08-08 15:20:39 "They're many factory farming industries that aren't treating animals like shit."

The entire business model of factory farming is to treat animals like commodities instead of sentient beings. To alleviate suffering would cost $$$ and affect profits, which is why they don't care.

115 2018-08-08 15:16:58 Just treated as non living commodities with no thought to them as living thinking feeling beings 
116 2018-08-08 15:13:28 That is why you don't have to keep your money in the bank, thy will use it to trade in commodities then you will pay the price, a car is instalment, petrol is expensive, food price is rising, do you think this hooligans cares?
117 2018-08-08 15:11:42 Thank you. How about wheat, Scotch, among many other commodities. These leftists are the absolute pinnacle of ignorance! This is all because this lady that was detained iver there is friend of the Obama's and Clintons. She's not even a Canadian citizen. But Trudeau always feels
118 2018-08-08 15:10:21 They also own half the Canadian wheat board among many other commodities. This is alot more serious than you leftists think.
119 2018-08-08 15:06:20 Africans fighting for European countries more or less knew the same fate. We have to understand that white people only see us as commodities to satisfy their needs.
120 2018-08-08 15:04:55 Shares of Glencore fell despite the company's announcement of record-breaking earnings. The multinational mining and commodities firm reported a 23 percent increase, but also reported higher production costs. #MarketWatch @OANN

123 2018-08-08 15:01:45 It's fraud plane and simple. They take the money and transfer it to property, fiat, commodities etc. Freinds of mine in the city make fortunes from crypto companies buying property in commission. Most are put under holding cos and can't be toughed when company goes bust. Scam.

125 2018-08-08 14:58:18 These sadists think this is normal behaviour because they deem the babies no more than commodities. They are unable to see them as living breathing feeling animals with personalities. This is where your milk comes from why do you still support this?
126 2018-08-08 14:55:23 O corte das bolsas da CAPES certamente significaria a estagnação da ciência brasileira. Estamos caminhando - lentamente, é verdade -, para ser um país criador/pesquisador. Parar essa caminhada é voltar a ser fornecedor de commodities e comprador de manufaturado.

128 2018-08-08 14:52:57 XRP Futures Trading : . With commodities, 60% of the gains are treated as long-term capital gains and 40% are treated as short-term capital gains. It does not matter the amount of time you held the contracts, this is how they are taxed.
129 2018-08-08 14:49:54 Oil is a fungible commodity.  Someone else will buy oil and it will go there.  Another (or same the entity) will sell to China.  Same with Soybeans.  China won't spite itself.  This is primarily a PR war on their side.  We sell mostly commodities.  They sell finished product.

133 2018-08-08 14:30:20 Keep in mind there are not good subs for soybeans from a protein stand point. Unless they curb total protein use the net effect is actually an increase in demand overall because subs are not as efficient. The spectrum of demand might shift but total demand of commodities goes up.

135 2018-08-08 14:10:34 That's the kind of analysis I like!! 

Totally agree, tvs have become commodities and the margins on them are not high. Also China has gone all in on these sort of things because they are relatively easy, making profitability for a US company even harder.

142 2018-08-08 14:01:28 It's unsettling how commonplace it is. Being a service provider (this also applies to any business where you provide a service), we are unfortunately often viewed by customers/clients as mere commodities to be “purchased” -hence the prevalent (albeit very wrong)...continued

161 2018-08-08 12:53:20 Where $BTC differs from ALL fiat and  commodities (even gold) is that despite a massive price boom or bust, supply is mathematically fixed lending to greater volatility. This is an argument against BTC by keynesians that favor debt based markets over equity based mkts.

200 2018-08-08 08:56:38 David got the right answer, similar to gold and oil being priced in USD, moves are reflected in commodities. About etoro sentiment it's not market sentiment but rather what users on the platform do. Most retail investors buy coins rather than shorting and that's visible there.
