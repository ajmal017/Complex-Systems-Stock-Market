0 2018-10-05 23:54:18 For me the challenges are mostly physical- standing for hours, keeping up with a marching crowd, managing long drives to DC. Buses & ride-sharing are scarce commodities.
1 2018-10-05 23:43:30 It’s hard to identify the crisis except big spec money is pulling out of commodities for the stock market.   Reading several things that think when fund mangers realize how undervalued commodities are money will flow back in and cause pretty big rallies.  Sounds plausible.
2 2018-10-05 23:40:48 Horse racing is not a 'community' event. It's a multi-million dollar industry that profits from cruelty &, treating animals as commodities & enables gambling addiction.
3 2018-10-05 23:06:55 I think his point is: crypto move so fast, everyone has ‘fall’en so many times already that they have had much effective trading experience has more seasoned equities/commodities traders
4 2018-10-05 23:01:39 @Crypto_Bitlord you tried trading FX or commodities fella ?
5 2018-10-05 22:59:23 Graduating from this school looks amazing on your CV, obviously. But it’s no coincidence that it scores really poorly for student satisfaction and rates are dropping. Students are commodities everywhere, but especially here.
6 2018-10-05 22:52:36 It's like you said there are men out there who view women as commodities and not an actual human being.
7 2018-10-05 22:43:53 Which is reality for a lot of commodities. The better approach is to market Canadian products without trashing American counterparts. Any campaign that suggests we're "better" than Americans is bullcrap. Our production systems are so insanely similar, it's also a laughable claim.
8 2018-10-05 22:33:46 I support MANDATORY annually psychological evaluations for all teachers, professors & staff in contact with children & young adults. We argue a brain is not fully formed til mid 20s. Why should we trust these fanatics with our precious commodities. They use our children as pawns
9 2018-10-05 22:24:24 I don't invest in commodities. For more, read my "Financial Freedom" essay on our website.
10 2018-10-05 22:12:32 But which is better kuti maBasic commodities awanikwe zvawo achidhura panekuti tione price yekunzi akacheaper but asirikuwanikwa?Eg,Cooking oil maOK yakanzi $3.69 but pamashelves hapana and fuel yakanzi $1.41 but hapana..
11 2018-10-05 22:10:37 Real Estate and commodities.
12 2018-10-05 22:02:54 Steps closer to living the Handmaid's Tale.  Older women like her will be holding a younger woman down while their husbands impregnate them. Women are becoming commodities not to be heard.
13 2018-10-05 21:55:59 commodities like my grandmother got back in the 50's?
14 2018-10-05 21:55:52 I'd respectfully disagree on the economics of creative products being particularly different from commodities like housing, and I'd also agree that capitalism (at least as it is) has made things bleak for creatives, but in the end I still agree with Warner's message.
15 2018-10-05 21:52:36 2 things that people wrongly try to make into commodities: 1. Culture, and 2. Sex.
16 2018-10-07 23:59:38 sem o resto a gnt tb se ferrava mano, é simples. o Sul depende de commodities do resto do pais, n tem combustível próprio, n tem grandes minas, n tem qse nd economicamente falando. Essa ideia separatista n se sustenta economicamente
17 2018-10-07 23:54:18 Lol good 4 u @SouthernKeeks @jerrysaltz is a moron! I 2 have family of my stripes&colors.I would sooner gnaw off a limb b4 I put politics b4 faith&family&friends!

19 2018-10-07 23:40:54 Are old sports guys the LAST group of people to understand the value of analytics?  Yeah ... yeah ... up hill both ways in snow.  Properly leveraging data one of the most valuable commodities around.  Oh, wow, he went for it and?  They won!  Imagine that
20 2018-10-07 23:40:15 Remind the farmers there how much Trump's sanctions are hurting family farms. And how his interest rates are impacting the stock & commodities markets. And how the price of steel--& everything else--has gone up since he became President.
21 2018-10-07 23:29:42 A razão básica na melhora dos Brasileiros entre 04-08 foi o boom dos preços das commodities causado pelo imenso crescimento da China.E mesmo assim o Brasil tinha o pior crescimento entres os países em desenvolvimento e no mínimo 1 ponto percentual a menos q o resto do mundo
22 2018-10-07 23:27:54 Economia aqui em bem mais complicada, os EUA tem empresas que valem um trilhão de dólares, aqui depende basicamente de preço de commodities
23 2018-10-07 23:22:42 O Brasil tem 350 bilhões de dólares, de fundo soberano de lastro. É por isso que eu digo, com a alta recente do preço do petróleo, que puxa o preço das commodities, pode se safar de uma falência. - - UK não tem commodities.
24 2018-10-07 23:22:28 No , pobre el Brasil de Lula y Dilma, que perdió la oportunidad de salir del atraso durante el boom de commodities mas grande de la historia a comienzo de siglo y se botó a la basura a punta de populismo socialista mediocre, eso si da lastima, lo demás es retórica
25 2018-10-07 23:19:46 @ArmandoSalguero For those wanting Gase gone (& I'm on the fence), there aren't many hot commodities out there.
26 2018-10-07 23:16:12 TheTechnican28-Oct.5th. Sell Crude-oil at present price. Also sell the Nikkei and buy the Yen at present price. The indexes shaping up for more downside movement. Always use a protective stop as there is a risk in trading. #commodities #Forex #Currencies #Crude #Nikkei #Stocks
27 2018-10-07 23:10:34 Quick relief is needed to ease inflation  and lower the prices of foods and commodities. Hindi pwede yung matagal at mabagal na aksyon ng gobyerno.
28 2018-10-07 23:08:59 Tengo claro que Lula disfrutó de cambios hechos por FHCardoso. Encima le tocó boom commodities y supo vender percepción de Brasil como potencia en ascenso pero era claro que su economía tan cerrada y menos diversificada que la nuestra no aguantaría. Partidos tipo PT saben gastar.
29 2018-10-07 23:08:21 Yes Just COMMODITIES!
30 2018-10-07 23:02:58 Feedback: although you criticize treating OER as objects, there is still no mention of authors. How can we go beyond OER as commodities that magically spring into being and include authors (plural!) into the analysis?
31 2018-10-07 22:46:13 Empower yourself by fighting your addiction to the capitalist commodities known as drugs.
32 2018-10-07 22:41:22 On the other hand, aside from air ships (I'm not even kidding), trains are the most efficient and sustainable form of long distance travel & shipping, but the former deserves, I believe, priority. Commodities can't enjoy freedom of movement, humans can.
33 2018-10-07 22:30:54 Honourable Minister @MthuliNcube did you see the spelling mistake on.commodities before shading this statement?
34 2018-10-06 23:44:49 La gente que se cuelga ya es una de nuestras commodities.
35 2018-10-06 23:44:06 Mining coal, gold and other Commodities uses more electric than Bitcoin
36 2018-10-06 23:41:29 It has collapsed. No fuel, no drugs , no basic commodities. It is happening.
37 2018-10-06 23:29:41 Capitalism is religion.
Banks are churches.
Bankers are church leaders.
Rich people are saints.
Poor people are sinners.
Wealth is heaven.
Poverty is hell.
Commodities are blessings.
Money is GOD.

Happy Sunday!!! 
38 2018-10-06 23:19:20 A spirit dedicated to goodness and compassion can never be broken.

And those that realize this...

Realize that earthly bodies are passing commodities. 

Those that attempt to chain us will never own our spirits...

And those that sell themselves for money...will never be free.
39 2018-10-06 22:58:16 Iwe uchiri kuitei joni imi "makahwinha"! Go and implement your manifesto. We want fuel, basic commodities, money in banks and remove that satanic 2% tax . Isu tisina mabasa tirikutandara zvedu pano

42 2018-10-06 22:25:09 La diferencia entre los dos modelos de país es que para el actual todos los recursos son "commodities" (en el sentido expo/internacional), y para el anterior solo son "commodities" (ídem) los recursos que sobran después de haber cubierto las necesidades básicas de la población.
43 2018-10-06 22:19:00 @evan_strand bonds and commodities are useful in some people’s portfolios, but I personally don’t use them anymore. But I may in the future
44 2018-10-06 22:15:39 Corporatists now control every bit of the government. This doesn't bode well for the people that are viewed as commodities to be used for ends that only benefit the wealthy. Get ready for huge cuts to social security, medicaid, and medicare as per Trump's 2019 budget.
45 2018-10-06 22:13:59 @evan_strand the problem was that bonds and commodities don’t act like equities and they don’t produce returns like equities. So..
46 2018-10-06 22:07:43 Yes, commodities are negotiated that way. In fact, if you are buying spices in an Indian market you also haggle and threaten to walk away a few times.
47 2018-10-06 22:00:45 You just want me to publicly admit I don't like trading places don't you?
Last time I did that, I had to put in for transfer from the commodities desk.
48 2018-10-06 21:49:49 Is APC. The exchange rate was jacked up x 3. This means that if you have 3000 naira before, what hyou have now is 1000 naira. The end results are seen in market commodities. This is real change they promised Nigerians and they didn't fail to keep it.
