0 2018-06-10 23:57:11 You know what I am looking forward to?  You keeping your promise to ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21.  

But you didn't.  

Are you afraid of the @NRA?

5 2018-06-10 23:45:57 Do you even understand macroeconomics?  It seems you don’t understand how these things work.  Running a defecit allows us to keep stocks high, lower our interest rates, and is strictly due to our global financial position, where the $ is traded.

7 2018-06-10 23:44:25 When I was starting out, I bought stocks that I wanted to go up. Now I buy stocks that are already going up.
8 2018-06-10 23:44:07 I totally agree! ETF are great, but if you want to boost your performance you have to buy individual stocks
9 2018-06-10 23:41:04 Sniper, do you use charts with/without extended hours?  I understand futures, you probably use extended since they trade during those hours, but how about for stocks (BIDU, BABA, NFLX, etc)?  Thanks in advance.

34 2018-06-10 23:33:00 Time for another stock 401k market drop.  Let me move my few dollars to cash.  I will transfer back to stocks after Trump makes up with the world.  My retirement can't be based on being friends with Kim and Putin.
35 2018-06-10 23:32:49 "Stocks opened lower on Wall Street today" has probably already been loaded into the teleprompter at the NPR studio in preparation for tomorrow's opening bell.
36 2018-06-10 23:32:09 Exactly. My view on HC is that 99% of posters only post on their stocks they are invested in and are probably find it too tough to be critical. If a poster can ONLY say positive things about a stock they hold then it's worth being weary. Always look at poster history for context!
37 2018-06-10 23:31:55 @ZenTrends Seems we are on the verge of a broad based rally. So I'm wonderg if we might be better off allocating to strong sector ETFs rather than to indiv stocks bcs so many stocks breaking out w/in those sectors that we can't be in all of them. Like to know your thoughts.
38 2018-06-10 23:30:52 Yes, I agree! The investors should turn up the heat and be more involved with getting #SEC @SEC_Enforcement to investigate this illegal activity as well as those involved with the crimes of BASHING & NAKED SHORT-SELLING!

40 2018-06-10 23:28:32 Bump stocks must be banned. The only reason for them is mass murder.
41 2018-06-10 23:27:34 They would also delay the times for rebuilding many overfished stocks.  The current Senate bill, S. 1520, isn’t so bad, but if passed would probably conference with HR 200, which is a very bad bill
42 2018-06-10 23:27:33 Twitter is like a modern day version of the stocks.
43 2018-06-10 23:27:28 I just filed a tip with the SEC about investors Naked Shorting $HMNY. If others feel the same, we need to apply pressure so they follow through and look into it
44 2018-06-10 23:26:05 It is now June. I've been saving 10 to 20% of my income each month. I'm now thinking about buying my first business (stock) of the year. Investing is a game of chess for me, not a fast-paced video game.

46 2018-06-10 23:16:49 How many Republicans in Congress and their fruends dumped their stocks this past week????
47 2018-06-10 23:16:05 The reason the left thinks it’s a mess is their whole party has been laughably exposed. There was no Russia/trump collusion. Trump ISNT putting us to war. More people have jobs. Stocks at all time high. The regressive left creates nothing but divisions and complaining adults.
48 2018-06-10 23:15:38 How many people are killed by bump stocks? But smoking, drinking, and unhealthy food are less dangerous?
49 2018-06-10 23:13:32 (Weren't a lot of the early T-grains marketed on their dye stability and color definition - putting an end to the red/pink degradation problems of the 70's stocks?)
50 2018-06-10 23:13:08 How many times have you bought/recommended puts on SPX/FANG stocks and calls on gold in the last 2 years and they all have expired worthless?
51 2018-06-10 23:12:19 I'm curious about this conversation - what do you mean by "Kodak Rochester stock?" I've never heard the Eastmancolor negative stocks from the early 80's as being notably blue - very interested to hear more about this!

56 2018-06-10 23:07:40 @wolfofwallst how would you like to talk about penny stocks to my followers in 10 -20 min Skype call ?? Big fan.
57 2018-06-10 23:07:13 They sound deranged! These lunatics need serious mental health evaluations. Strait jacket stocks should be going through the roof due to these mental cases!
58 2018-06-10 23:05:26 Bump stocks have never been used in a school shooting.
59 2018-06-10 23:01:54 War only benefits those who owns stocks in military contractors, the rest of us merely die in them.
60 2018-06-10 23:00:41 You’d think they’d be beyond screenshots of coinbase since crypto now dominates this show. Please focus on stocks. I’m starting to lose interest.
61 2018-06-10 23:00:22 LMAO! That was the past 8 years buttercup. American's now think they died and went to heaven. More jobs, bonuses, wage increases, stocks, economy skyrocketing. I see why they call some LIBTARDS now.
62 2018-06-10 23:00:17 Exactly lip chap stocks have sky rocketed since the con Trump's election

64 2018-06-10 22:58:51 They know that their wealth is based on owning large shares of the productive capacity of civilisation, in the form of stocks, real estate they rent out, etc. They use those shares selfishly, but they know they won't benefit if the thing they are shares of is destroyed.
65 2018-06-10 22:58:12 Soros gained by gambling (Trading stocks and commodities.) Pres. Trump gained by building and conducting global business. One gambles to gain on others's loss. The leader gains on building value, jobs, better lives and bringing prosperity.

I hope you get rolled up in the #SpecialCounsel indictments. 

You deserve nothing less, & failing that,  maybe being #TarredAndFeathered &put in stocks in front of the #WH.

73 2018-06-10 22:48:31 The reason stocks trade a ton is because each share of stock of a class is the same as every other share of stock of that class.

84 2018-06-10 22:38:58 There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks. 131
85 2018-06-10 22:37:49 Get it back like it's been given by pushovers in the past? American's like where things are headed. The only laughing stocks are those that oppose everything our president does because their own party isn't running the country any more. Get over it, Clinton.
86 2018-06-10 22:37:22 I’ve got many data sets over the years... grain trading, trading indices, to trading bonds, even stocks. Some products I was completely systematic, some products it was purely discretionary trading. The times I did best, were when I traded discretionarily, mainly scalping ES...
87 2018-06-10 22:37:18 How do you define booming?  Jobs numbers and wage numbers are worse than with Obama. Stocks are leveling off.
88 2018-06-10 22:37:05 Bump stocks have no place in the general public neither do automatic weapons both are meant for war the only reason anyone wants these is for mass murder and if they aren't banned by government then they are also to blame for murders that follow #BanBumpStocks NOW
89 2018-06-10 22:36:45 VoSI is initiating Crypto Reports addressing trading themes and ideas in the crypto-space, which in our view includes both the currencies themselves, Ethereum, Bitcoin, Dash, Ripple, Monero, and related stocks.
90 2018-06-10 22:35:57 Only military personnel need automatic weapons. Bump stocks are not for self defense or hunting. Please BAN BUMP STOCKS NOW!
91 2018-06-10 22:35:24 @DutchieFlair - dawg - I see ur crypto pod cast - I always wish ballers the best of luck - great work by the way - I suggest u diversify it - u need more material - weed/cannabis stocks - Canada legalizing - so many ways to make money in this world - u fellas need to open it up
92 2018-06-10 22:35:17 I think you underestimate the scale of the challenge. It's not just buying replacement kit, spare parts, fuel, increasing training time and frequency of exercises, building ammunition stocks up to appropriate level & etc & etc... It's also reforming the whole procurement process.

103 2018-06-10 22:27:34 We need to bring back the stocks.
104 2018-06-10 22:27:02 Of course! I've been guilty before. We are on a bull market and it's easy to bet big on certain stocks because "we know what we are doing".

My secret? If whatever I'm trying to do doesn't align with my strategy, I don't do it. No matter how great the opportunity seems to be
105 2018-06-10 22:26:40 I watched BIOAQ go from Nasdaq to OTC and have watched it ever since. You didn't hook me up with anything but thank you
106 2018-06-10 22:26:32 I know this will sound harsh, but put them in stocks for public ridicule; like in a plexiglass box so you could throw stuff at them.
107 2018-06-10 22:23:00 You carry?
108 2018-06-10 22:22:09 BIOA was on Nasdaq 2 months ago and went bankrupt hence the Q. The fins will be shit. You can no doubt make money on this but be careful
109 2018-06-10 22:20:27 this season of #ChampsVSStars has honestly made @MTV and @TheChallengeMTV laughing stocks.. you gonna show people cheating and let them win? dead  also the “powerplays” are sooo predictable and geared towards the stars lmao

111 2018-06-10 22:16:09 It didn't make us competitive, it handed a lot of money to wealthy people so they could buy back stocks, and does nothing for our economy because it shafted the middle class.  The crash is coming, what will your excuse be?  Can't blame it on Dems, its all on you.

115 2018-06-10 22:11:28 3. People sensible enough to know bump stocks is a pretty good place to draw a line.
116 2018-06-10 22:11:01 It was cool getting into stocks with my dad. But, I was drilled with the mindset of “buy and hold” and that worked against me for a long time... old habits die hard... I recommend getting children involved with their “financial literacy” as early as possible...
117 2018-06-10 22:10:05 what is it you are upset with twinkletoes? booming economy,korean deal,record low unemployment,soaring stocks,a world that respects us again?   explain what has your panties in a wad.

125 2018-06-10 21:53:33 The only ones that are enjoying any significant difference from trump’s policies are the richest Americans.  Unemployment has been trending down for some time, interest rates are slowly increasing, and we’re just one trump fuck up from declining stocks.

138 2018-06-10 21:36:09 This might be true but both active and passive investments can meet this this definition.  The thing with real estate is that not much changes month to month (like say stocks, which change minute to minute).  So direct RE investments can seem passive but they really aren't.

146 2018-06-10 21:29:39 And that's why your on stocks still. Gotta study and be ahead of the curve that's how I roll. Follow the money is my motto and I love the money that's investing into crypto. Fuck the Banksters, they need to go

So because the government was unwilling to stop diafiltered milk, DFO originally created class 6 and then the rest of Canada created class 7 with the price set at world price which is cheaper than US.

Cannot  force gun reform agenda on dogged mindset; if red states want their guns/bump stocks, so be it.
Blue states will do best to regulate within their dynamic.

Our economy is getting strong than ever, more jobs than job seekers, real estate up, stocks up. 

Seems pretty stable.

159 2018-06-10 21:14:22 Hi Mduduzi. Hope you are well. I've been short the ZAR since it broke above 12.16 but not via a geared product. I just buy the NEWUSD and some Rand hedge stocks. Quite a basic approach, but it works for me. (I'm staying short)
160 2018-06-10 21:13:44 NRA is in favor of bump stock regulations so your kinda on the NRA’s side on that issue. If you really want to be true to yourself and Nora on every issue then maybe you should be in favor of bump stocks.
161 2018-06-10 21:06:43 Lol Brady I've been trading stocks since 1996. And its not the end of the year yet. We will see $25k before the end of the year imo. Crypto and blockchain are the future. Did you miss the IBM blockchain commercial during Superbowl and nba finals?

167 2018-06-10 20:58:52 Oh, we dippin?

I'm not nervous tbh. After trading for a long time, you learn that the markets (stocks or crypto) will do what they do.

Have a plan & strategy. 

Have discipline.

Most importantly, DON'T let emotions dictate your decision making!!

176 2018-06-10 20:44:53 It's not bullying...  It's fairness to the lil man.  If you trade stocks on Wall St, you want globalization. We are being played by these people.
177 2018-06-10 20:44:37 Yay more bump stocks and death for everyone!  Freedom!!!
178 2018-06-10 20:44:13 We saw something similar to what you describe from 1998-00; it’s only inflationary for tech stocks that have no fundamentals or P/E to impede.  Wildcard this time is US fiscal situation & demographics and reliance on asset price appreciation for GDP growth are more pronounced

181 2018-06-10 20:41:36 did either of us say we wanted bump stocks to be legal? i didnt say it, i dont think they should be legal, eventhough they arent as effective as you may wish to believe they are
182 2018-06-10 20:39:56 what is your justification for the continued legalization of bump stocks? what practical use could they have?
183 2018-06-10 20:39:37 During the festival season, there is the looming threat of yakisoba sets reaching low stocks.
184 2018-06-10 20:39:01 We've also banned bump stocks.
We have some of the most stringent laws in this country and have the lowest gun deaths across the board. Gun laws work. We need national laws that keep guns from lenient states out of states like MA.
185 2018-06-10 20:38:31 do you remember the las vegas shooting, and the 50 something casualties that came from that? he used a bump stock some of the 23 weapons recovered to make them into assault rifles. why do we need these bump stocks?
186 2018-06-10 20:36:32 @JudgeJeanine How about u and the rest of the Trump lovers go form ur own country where u can hate blacks, hate Latinos, hate gays, hate our allies, keep ur assault weapons, automatic rifles and bump stocks, wall urselves off and when ur done, go eff yourselves. That'd be great

188 2018-06-10 20:34:27 Kudlow is a television personality with a 50-50 record on picking stocks. He has no business in his position. He’s a Trump lickspittle, period.
189 2018-06-10 20:29:59 I agree, in a perfect world, we'd have all film stocks in all possible formats
190 2018-06-10 20:28:36 Vi um monte de empresa de private equity comprar cias listadas, enfiar seus executivos na cia, se encherem de stock options, e forçar guidances e recompras ridículas pra puxar o px da ação em benefícios próprios nas stocks options. Fora os ganhos de perf no fdo de PE. Criminoso.
191 2018-06-10 20:27:48 Let's talk #stocks $HUGE new to the Canadian market. Bought for the long run we got 3000 at .11 cent's. However the three others we have are slowly going up. Now $ADOM I have a good feeling it will rise at 9:30am and come back down at 11ish 1.28 is not bad I got it at 1.23
192 2018-06-10 20:24:12 Ha! In two years the "Trump train" has violated the 2nd more than Obama did in 8! Trump is no friend of the constitution. If he was he wouldn't be directing the DOJ to ban bump stocks and he wouldn't have signed the "fix NICS" bill.
193 2018-06-10 20:24:06 They learned well from how they trade stocks, same crap.

199 2018-06-10 20:17:12 I don’t only care about the ar15. I care any gun that can be modified to be used automatic. If bump stocks can be used anywhere, why not ban those? This argument is pointless because you would rather have your guns and a bump stock and shoot up your neighbors.

206 2018-06-10 20:09:30 Thing is, from a transitional VC perspective, valuations for these early stage startups is still stupidly high. Can say the same about stocks of course. Question is - do they need to radically deflate before the next up cycle returns or can we consolidate around here to eat time

209 2018-06-10 20:07:17 Ban Bump Stocks!
210 2018-06-10 20:06:47 The interesting thing is, using seismic and well data, we might be able to get at the rates which salt flows within the wall! And when (and why) stocks nucleate along walls...a question even Martin couldn’t give me a decent answer too!
211 2018-06-10 20:06:25 Microsoft's stocks go up 70%
212 2018-06-10 20:04:07 I’ma be over in Irvine for the next few weeks, in a suit looking like I just sold some stocks or like my business just went public
213 2018-06-10 20:03:40 Not YOU. Them and their cronies. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE intelligent discussion of stocks but when name calling and ignorance comes into play it's indicative of intelligence level of the people carrying on the discussion and it ends for me right there and then.
214 2018-06-10 20:03:17 Haha. Yep I’ve been close of selling out but got other stocks to entertain me in the short term. It’s tested me that’s for sure
215 2018-06-10 20:01:24 you cannot count unrealized profits as missing out otherwise what about every other asset you're missing out on? Gold, pork futures, stocks, etc? Do you lose money because you didnt catch those pumps too?
216 2018-06-10 20:01:23 that’s where i’m leaning, stocks have more day 2 day wearability
217 2018-06-10 20:00:46 Yep, wish it was a set of stocks though. Found a derelict house in the woods on the the bank or a river. It was well cool

223 2018-06-10 19:51:25 Never said they were. But when unstable people r able to get their hands on semi auto long rifles equipped with bump stocks and high capacity mags, you have a problem.

No stable western democracy with stricter gun control than the US has suffered from a lack of the greater good.
224 2018-06-10 19:50:33 T'inquiètes pas ils vont faire de nouveaux stocks
225 2018-06-10 19:49:36 Thanks for sharing your WL.   I have learned it helps me, during the weekend routine, to create a very strict canslim top tier WL--usually only 2 or 3 stocks.  This weekend only one made the top tier list $QLYS .   Not entirely happy with it as sales and ROE  a little light
226 2018-06-10 19:49:28 Also keeping an eye on $SE. A little worried that recent IPO Asian tech stocks are gonna correct soon, but boy oh boy are they ever growing rapidly.
227 2018-06-10 19:48:04 Oui la première nuit de la rupture de stock il y avait de nouveaux stocks au compte goutte mais plus rien depuis 
228 2018-06-10 19:46:41 I love how Big3 rejected, neglected, and lost so many talented people. No wonder why their stocks/incomes are going down.

He's a blowhard, lying, racist, fraudulent POS...and shame on you for backing him and his lies about everything including G7 where he tried to suck up to Putin
241 2018-06-10 19:35:05 Rotation is one of the key spices in a bull run mix.  The money keeps moving around between a handful of sectors.  While one sector is running I’m always looking for what is next.  I prefer stocks that have a strong sector theme.  They tend to have better runs.  Why is that....
242 2018-06-10 19:34:13 Stocks which are new (listed in last 1-3 years) will not be having values on monthly timeframe and will suffer not being selected/ rejected due to d cut off scheme proposed and weightage of 4 to monthly TF.
eg. AUBANK
Is this correct ? if yes, how to deal with that ?
243 2018-06-10 19:33:35 We have already banned bump stocks lol 
We will always win cuz of people like you are just follower's of the dumb ass Hollywood asswipes . When you gonna go out with out your bodyguards? That are locked n loaded? intill then shisss up Don't be a fake & phony . find a JOB if u can
244 2018-06-10 19:33:27 What happened Joe? Did the global stocks you've invested in plummet? I too would think president Trump is the worst president of all if my socialist, globalist plans were foiled. Fortunately I'm not one of those.
245 2018-06-10 19:31:27 Since when does it have mean institutions entering the space = up in price? 

Institutions also trade/invest in stocks, forex, commodities, futures... and they go up AND down.

250 2018-06-10 19:27:20 I truly don't know. Seems stocks now only discount near-term profit prospects, not long-term policy issues. There will be some tension between short and long-term issues for a time to come.
251 2018-06-10 19:24:59 Think so, made into stocks.

260 2018-06-10 19:18:05 Our printer, like many others, has many paper stocks. The price difference is minimal on using a different stock for a cover. About two cents a comic. The newsprint is a third of the cost of other higher end stocks. Other than that, we also sell advertising in the comics.
261 2018-06-10 19:15:03 I can get a 7% dividend return investing in a very safe telecom BCE.Yet I am told it will be better to invest in ETF with More risky companies and much lower dividend... as baskets, ETFs contain the good and the ugly. There will always be a place for good individual Stocks

265 2018-06-10 19:11:06 Yeah, my bad. Character limits.

Either argument though is used by those who want to ban bump stocks though.
266 2018-06-10 19:10:16 What can I say.. I love to learn new things!
267 2018-06-10 19:10:15 Gap stocks plummet 27% after 12 year old jokes it stands for 'gay and proud'
268 2018-06-10 19:09:06 American stock prices are being inflated by a lot of companies using their $ from #taxreform to buy back their stocks so they can then resell them at higher prices. Eventually the value of those stocks will crash.

270 2018-06-10 19:07:49 Wow...saw ur scores big on stocks and crypto investment class. Please PM me.
271 2018-06-10 19:07:40 I didn't say bump stocks turn semi autos into autos, I said they alter the rate of fire to mimic an automatic rate of fire.
I do think that a bump stock can be made from anything flexible. I haven't seen it but considering a bump stock can fit in two fingers, I agree with you.
272 2018-06-10 19:06:40 When stocks or crypto make parabolic moves and it seems too good to be true, many times it is. Although HODLing can pay off in the long term, swing trading based on moving averages can save a lot of pain $BTC $ETH $LTC
273 2018-06-10 19:05:26 Wall Street has convinced us, that investing in up and down stocks, is a smarter investment then ourselves #misinformed #wronginformation
274 2018-06-10 19:03:46 The “bump stocks turn semiautomatic rifles into automatics” argument is nothing but fear mongering from the left.

Theoretically, you could take any piece of plastic, form it into the shape of a bump stock and the outcome would still be the same: a gun that has horrible accuracy.
275 2018-06-10 19:02:36 Ouch one of my oil stocks went bankrupt, can kinder be far behind. Venezuela and Brazil dying. People working in oil industry out of work. Thanks Francis. Enjoy compline.

277 2018-06-10 18:59:00 Idk man but mark my words these De’Aron Fox stocks are an absolute steal right now.

279 2018-06-10 18:58:02 @jimcramer Booyah Jim, I find your weekly Friday game plan segment always prove informative. The Fed on Wed will move the market.  What level of the prime rate in your opinion will be the point that slows the bull market in stocks and what level is ideal?

284 2018-06-10 18:55:20 Though the argument is that bump stocks make the semi-auto fire as if it's an automatic. While I agree that this can be an issue couldn't someone just use any flexible material as a bump stock?
285 2018-06-10 18:55:19 Let's talk about @TSM_Leffen 's game 4 against Armada in WS at SNS:

Armada won neutral 4 times; Leffen won neutral 8 times
Aramada dealt 38%; Leffen took 4 stocks

THIS MAN IS SO CLEAN

289 2018-06-10 18:52:29 the surest indicator that it's almost over for tech stocks, is Goldman's sincere promise to muppets clients that technology is not a bubble: it means that Goldman is now actively dumping its entire prop and flow tech exposure to anyone gullible enough to believe it.

293 2018-06-10 18:48:29 It’s a good time to convert stocks to cash position.
294 2018-06-10 18:47:38 It's only logical if he's getting paid to do it. Otherwise, it just seems illogical and irrational to be spamming everyone with his tweets about this one stock. Oh well, I guess we'll all soon see who's right. This is one of my stocks that is up right now!

296 2018-06-10 18:45:21 Dips in a stocks who’s ceo does an unannounced r/s are usually followed by more “dips” and dilution. When that’s done I’ll take a position
297 2018-06-10 18:42:53 Sounds like he's doing just fine. @SenSanders Stocks are up, employment is down. People have more money in their paychecks. Career politicians hate Trump because he threatens their existence. Knows how to solve a crisis rather than create one. #Winning
298 2018-06-10 18:41:41 Can I just say shut the fuck up you fraud! You are a joke to the entire country! Laughing stocks who make up their life’s story shouldn’t even be seen much less heard.

300 2018-06-10 18:38:59 I also use MarketSmith India's paid service to shortlist growth stocks to trade. I am hoping to use one system rather than using multiple systems.
301 2018-06-10 18:37:46 I am bullish on stocks as earnings will be good due to economy and record stock buy back programs. Some firms are going to be posting blowout numbers for this quarter....
302 2018-06-10 18:37:19 I like using the gap close as a pivot for these type of stocks.  Bought this on Friday.

I just like buying stocks that are being bashed by promoters that are looking for attention like you are and I don't really care if there are voting rights available or not as I don't vote on corporate affairs anyway. I trade for profits.

364 2018-06-10 17:27:55 If Trump wanted to help the American worker he would want higher wages and benefits for them

Didn't see Trump talking to corporations to do that, just faux tax cut so corporations could buy back stocks, shareholders even foreign shareholders made more money than American workers

They are not needed
399 2018-06-10 16:42:33 a case for buying individual high-quality securities? When I looked at BCE, with a safe 7% yield, an add told me I should “diversify my risk”with a much lower yielding index ETF, that includes higher risk companies!  ETFs tend to have much lower yields than Individual stocks!

401 2018-06-10 16:41:11 That Friday webinar wasn’t as broad as I should have made it... but I hope the underlying message was there. I didn’t mean to focus on single stocks but more so understanding the stock you are trading and sizing, planning accordingly
402 2018-06-10 16:41:05 The large enhancement programs in Alaska are also a risk.  We know nothing about how one river stock affects another.

407 2018-06-10 16:38:02 You're wrong. Again, we're NOT advocating to abolish 2nd A, we ARE to ban assault-style rifles & bump stocks which R used predominantly in school mass shootings to SAVE KIDS LIVES IN SCHOOLS. Fact. Who's ignorant now?
408 2018-06-10 16:37:59 Tech stocks, Reliance, Pvt sector banks, LT, FMCG are all in bullish mode. Pharma is turning bullish. So nifty will not correct much.
409 2018-06-10 16:37:34 Ok. Then in the interest of common sense, what was the percentage of raise you’ve received/tax cut u are enjoying? Also in the name of common sense if you have stocks for retirement then that immediately puts u in a minority of Americans. Most don’t have even an extra $500. Fact.

Bump stocks have no legitimate use and have only been used in the Vegas attack.
Assault is an action not a type of weapon and the last ban was ineffective.

438 2018-06-10 16:17:03 By passing more laws that aren’t aimed at doing that or that are redundant? Okay dude. Tell me how banning bump stocks and limiting mag capacity gonna do that? And how is removing due process considered “common sense” in your mind?

440 2018-06-10 16:16:23 Companies buy back their own stocks to look like the stock market is up. It's called overinflating the stock market. Fox News loves to lie. Their owner is a friend of Trump. He also owns the National Enquirer, where little green men and Trump get their news.

470 2018-06-10 16:00:47 Asset class allocation also tends to need less maintenance than following & interpreting developments on individual stocks, bonds, etc. because with indexing you are diversified within each asset class. So it is more of a macro focus

473 2018-06-10 15:59:31 Focus less on being someone "worth looking up to" and focus more on playing better. Your goal should be to minimize bad situations and never lose two stocks to the same set-up/situation

Focus on playing better, and winning will come
474 2018-06-10 15:58:26 My point is that the vast majority of people think picking winning stocks is the key to investment success, & I interpreted your "backtesting" comment in that context. I'm saying that picking asset classes & indexing within them is easier, & will have a greater impact on perf.

524 2018-06-10 15:14:43 Speaking of empiricism, looking through the lens of price, (objectivity) the weight of evidence still suggest higher rates, higher dollar, higher stocks.
525 2018-06-10 15:13:17 Stocks definitely! But there is a risk of course

539 2018-06-10 15:00:44 Sure. But there is no such thing as pure action, and we all exist in a dynamic system where constantly making decisions. We can still make good, ethical and informed decisions with evidence. I'm sure there was insufficient evidence for Atlantic Cod stocks.
540 2018-06-10 15:00:37 Lol.. he said he wants to by both stock and security.
Bro, stocks are one type of security.... And securities are tradable financial assets, could be 
- stock (equity securities)
- bonds (debt securities) and
- derivative securities.

543 2018-06-10 14:59:49 @UKNikon Any idea when stocks of the Nikon P900 will start flowing into the UK, or is this model being replaced ?
544 2018-06-10 14:59:39 Agree. I doubt his bets on airlines and sin stocks also. Acc to me, alcohol consumption wont increase more than 3-5% per year but spending on alcohol will increase as more people will go to bars instead of drinking at home.
545 2018-06-10 14:59:20 Oh goodness that's brought back memories. My Dad had a plant nursery and used to grow ten thousand rose trees. 
I used to have to scrape out round the bottom of the stocks and then tie the bud in with raffia. Was I pleased when he bought the rubber ties with staples.
546 2018-06-10 14:57:19 I wanna see an Iron Man mode. Like you have 5 stocks and every stock is a different character
547 2018-06-10 14:56:22 Using your strategy here for the move up to earnings... working very well so far thanks! What software do you use for scanning historical IV going into earnings for various stocks as you did for $MU?

550 2018-06-10 14:54:16 Disagree.  India and China have the majority of the world's population, and unless they're on board, any concerted action -- on climate change for instance, fisheries stocks, or population control -- will be more challenging.
551 2018-06-10 14:53:44 ...channel it, filter it, funnel it.
Stocks, securities, tax-free municipals. Send the money out into the real world. And when it comes back, squeaky clean.
552 2018-06-10 14:53:18 I wish I could give a get rich strategy by investing in the stock market. I really wish I could.

Unfortunately making money on stocks takes time. Like +5 years to see great results
553 2018-06-10 14:53:07 I don’t want my money to sit in my bank. I feel like having money in my bank account is probably the least efficient way to use money. What can I do with it besides FD? 

Stocks, crypto, unit trust etc? 
554 2018-06-10 14:53:02 If ETFs helped fuel stocks rise (and they have) then it goes to reason when the trend reverses ETFs will help fuel stocks fall.
555 2018-06-10 14:52:13 Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix & Google parent Alphabet - otherwise known as FANG + Apple - comprise some 25% of the value of the Nasdaq Composite.

563 2018-06-10 14:41:40 He hasn’t peaked. If you look at any business or stocks it goes up and down. Even top rated tv shows have up and down seasons. Instead of being ugly and negative maybe give constructive criticism.
564 2018-06-10 14:38:28 I seriously hope you get fired. I didn't buy all these Google stocks to pay for dumb employees.

566 2018-06-10 14:36:57 #Investing 

It's a very "mental" game. In bad years some individual stocks can be down 40%+ & total portfolio down 25-30%. 

In theory it's easy to hold through, but very tough to practice!
567 2018-06-10 14:34:42 If you are in long term.. Just close your app for now .. check this after few months... Crypto is a revolution which is just beginning.. 

Wall Street doesn't want people to invest in crypto.. because it's a danger for traditional stocks but let them be..
568 2018-06-10 14:34:41 “Make the stocks prove themselves, ok? They have to have good price action, they have to have good volume, they have to be breaking out in order for you to do anything with them.” ~@timothysykes // #timchallenge #trading #daytrading
569 2018-06-10 14:34:11 There is huge divergence between financial media worries about trade tariffs and interest rates and price action. And I don't remember a single period since the 1990s that financial media was right. #stocks #markets
570 2018-06-10 14:33:32 Thank you so much Bill! I really appreciate it! I don’t want to rely on paid services. I want to be able to trade options and stocks on my own.
571 2018-06-10 14:33:13 My dad already sold rocks. Ima sell these stocks
572 2018-06-10 14:32:07 Simple. 50% US index ETF/50% EAFE index ETF. I know that stocks have a muncher high probability of outperforming bonds (and other asset classes) in 10 year periods so I’m going 100% stocks.
573 2018-06-10 14:31:52 Yes but US needs more even guns.
More bump stocks, more "suppressors", more armor piecering hollow points, more AR-15's for rabbit hunting.
Drones with hellfire missles for security of each home!
More is always better.
574 2018-06-10 14:31:32 Ooooh yeah. Still seems weird it’s not part of the system since they can update via the App Store now, especially when things like Stocks ship on it ¯\(°_o)/¯. 

Maybe it’s a way to prevent confusion from non technical users.

581 2018-06-10 14:21:58 Dear .@Alyssa_Milano 

There is a CDC study that Progressives ignore. 

Most AR15 owners don’t use bump-stocks. So no biggie.

Several challenges to local and state changes to gun laws in federal courts, both against age restrictions and outright bans.

You’re not winning. #2A
582 2018-06-10 14:21:24 There were no stocks of WMD left, Saddam had expended them during the Iran/Iraq war (more than a million killed), on the Kurds in the North, and on the Marsh Arabs in the south.
583 2018-06-10 14:19:55 Hey Leila; unfortunately this is the only store that currently stocks it. The range will be coming to selected stores; however these and the release date hasn't been confirmed yet. Thanks, Beth
584 2018-06-10 14:18:01 Spooky. I am just rereading John Train. Finished the chapter on T.Rowe Price and picked up my phone and saw this tweet. It’s a great book. Fascinating how few of the stocks are still around.

586 2018-06-10 14:15:03 @WesMoss365 Any thoughts investing in Canadian marijuana stocks?
587 2018-06-10 14:12:14 True, yet if they had limited the pilot to stocks that, before the pilot, had spreads of 5-10 cents, I suspect they would have found a (limited) benefit.   That result is drowned out in the noise of all the extraneous data...

589 2018-06-10 14:10:41 The current proposal is “ass backwards” however, with no agent or baseline data, no success criteria, too many stocks involved, too long a time period, and too many complex groupings.    A scientific, limited & controlled experiment is what is called for...
590 2018-06-10 14:10:32 I hope Prive still has stocks when I have the money to buy a Tshirt from them ;; they said they'll have unlimited stocks so i hope its okay ww
591 2018-06-10 14:10:15 There is ALWAYS that!  My fav? The permanent 1990s mantra of “buy and hold stocks” which was being screamed to the public by ALL major investment houses/banks/advisors/Media/CFPs/whatever... Three years later, not so much, S&P500 down 50%, NASDAQ down 89% #pfft
592 2018-06-10 14:07:45 Still restocking ang bighit~ that's why it's for reservation, hopefully around July may stocks na sila since start ng world tour ay Aug. 
593 2018-06-10 14:06:11 For those claiming #Bitcoin is a bubble b/c post-SegWit, post BCash #BTC rose to 0.0003% of legacy fin'l markets - how come stocks that dramatically rise due to increased earnings and market share growth, product adoption, competition weakness, etc, are not considered the same?

596 2018-06-10 14:01:33 If the 'curbs are in effect' on Wall Street how do I get my stocks out of the gutter?
597 2018-06-10 14:01:23 companies. Low or zero debt, clean balance sheets, high dividend payouts & everlasting demand. All the managements have to do is to steer their companies well. So stocks like Lever, Colgate, Nestle, Britania, Godrej Consumer, Jyothy Laboratories become excellent long term bets
598 2018-06-10 13:58:49 If you check my tweets i have always been a buyer in FMCG stocks. Given India's population & rising & our penchant for food demand will only rise. Who can stay away from food, personal care etc? The best thing is you don't have to ask anyone. These are some of the best managed
599 2018-06-10 13:57:18 Me levanto y veo que siguen discutiendo flujos en lugar de stocks
600 2018-06-10 13:56:10 Should I buy stocks in Uniqlo? Does this count as insider information.
601 2018-06-10 13:55:45 Sohm conference: the best recommendation made in last week's Sohn India Conference was stocks belonging to food & related categories. Jyothy Labs, Brittania, Parag Milk etc. Related idea was Bombay Burmah, which owns 51% stake in Brittania & 38% in Bombay Dyeing.
602 2018-06-10 13:55:15 Fundamentally it’s a constitutional change and that has a possibility of igniting a powder keg. Imagine banning the use of encryption under the guise of fighting terrorism, removing the right to privacy. In some states no one has surrendered their bump stocks.
603 2018-06-10 13:53:55 @fmrwebmail I did chk my finances! My #stocks are in the toilet & my IRA is down $3g’s since JANUARY! Not to mention, there has been ZERO #wagegrowth. So thanks for your USELESS, although typical, #TrumpCult response! #TrumpDerangementSyndrome
604 2018-06-10 13:53:38 When I see the European Central Bank purchasing US corporate debt...when I see the Swiss National Bank printing money to purchase US stocks...when I see the Bank of Japan purchase vast portions of their equity markets w/ printed funds, there is an ongoing stench of a "new normal"
605 2018-06-10 13:50:43 Live in Durban... who stocks them?
606 2018-06-10 13:50:36 I think banning bump stocks is a great idea. The assault weapon ban is a complicated thing to argue and define when listing weapons to ban. Rising the age to own a gun to 21 is the worst part because it takes away the right to defend yourself especially for kids who go to college
607 2018-06-10 13:49:27 Contrary to fiscal sales, a game can release on an off season to combat holiday sale metrics. 

It's a bold move but it's worked before. Stocks have time to settle then increase the day of release. 

Fiscal years end in February for most companies regardless.

610 2018-06-10 13:46:45 Pass. It’s one of the biggest challenges. In strong markets there could be literally hundreds of stocks I could happily own, but you just can’t have them all. It’s a very discretionary part of what I do. If I automated it you could solve that issue by having a fixed universe.
611 2018-06-10 13:45:49 Révolution lybienne qui a précipité ce pays, jadis prospère, dans l'enfer des luttes entre seigneurs de guerre, des trafics d'êtres humains, de la présence de Daech, sans oublier la disparition des stocks d'or, sans doute pas perdus pour tout le monde.

Bring back stocks & public flogging, broadcast it via social media & get people to vote on how many smacks on the bottom they get... that’ll damage their street cred’
627 2018-06-10 13:32:30 That already happened. Which is why US real estate and stocks are insane. The only substantive move will be to gold. And when that Hallie happens, the USD will fall 50%+ which will be good in the long run

649 2018-06-10 13:13:57 How can North Korea even be expected to make a deal with a president who can't even keep his promise to the Parkland students to get rid of bump stocks? @realDonaldTrump
650 2018-06-10 13:13:50 When He fired trade war threats to China alone couple of months ago, stocks (esp. tech stocks) dropped for a week.

652 2018-06-10 13:11:59 I've been trading stocks before you where a glint in your fathers eye and your right, I don't understand the market. 

Now go away little boy and peddle the two bit companies you and your crew represent to someone else and come back when you grow up. 

On second thought don't.

654 2018-06-10 13:09:57 I'm sure that getting North Korea to give up it's nukes will be way easier than getting the nra to give up bump stocks
655 2018-06-10 13:08:37 No these are the facts, you are just too brainwashed to understand and your hate is taking over your common sense. But that’s your problem. My business is doing great, stocks are up! My teens found Summer Jobs in a day!   #maga

662 2018-06-10 13:02:35 Europe has a much stronger economy than US. Your stock market these days is a game  of Monopoly between the 1% while Trump attacks certain industries to tilt stocks in favour of his donors and friends. The US stands alone here w Russia , NK and Israel.

669 2018-06-10 12:56:08 Just realized I put “stocks” instead of “stalks” on my IG story and no one told me... people just want to see you fail.
670 2018-06-10 12:54:06 that is the equivalent of trading in stocks and shares. Sounds like a wise investment
671 2018-06-10 12:52:50 Depends on the strategy and number of stocks involved, doesn't it? If you have 100 stocks and outperforms for ten years I'ld say that's rather significant. If you have 10 stocks however... not so much.

674 2018-06-10 12:50:54 Looks like @realDonaldTrump has the support of Asian market, and the EU is losing the argument, love his little smile like a big FU going on in his head.
675 2018-06-10 12:50:15 What's wrong with YOU?! Stocks up, jobless rates down, our country is doing better than it has in 50 years but because you don't like Trump (never mind he's doing an EXCELLENT job in politics when he's not a politician) you want to see him fail? SMH!!

Our GDP will drop if we cut back on imports. It's a economic fact. 

We get more than we give; a lot more. But we make up for that by providing military protection...

698 2018-06-10 12:22:08 I’ve found their online stock-check and the click-and-collect service to be very good recently (had to replace rear garden decking). Will check stocks in several stores near you, which might save you a wasted journey.

700 2018-06-10 12:19:30 Perhaps Canada puts a tariff on dairy in response to US farm subsidies that artificially puts downward price pressure on US agricultural as compared to Global food stocks.  You would know that if you prepared with facts instead of instincts you learned on the streets in Queens.
701 2018-06-10 12:17:13 Didn't he ban bump-stocks or was that just an idea floated?
702 2018-06-10 12:16:15 MARAMING STOCKS HAHAHHAHAAHAHA
703 2018-06-10 12:15:24 Interest rates and stocks going up enable more people to self fund their retirements.  Trade wars when the deals lack parity are not good options and the tax cuts appear in every pack check so whilst some costs have risen, the wages and the take home for most has remained above.
704 2018-06-10 12:14:35 Typically LIC has 60-70,000 cr to invest in markets. They do directly into stocks & not really into MFs IMO.

717 2018-06-10 11:56:55 The additional 4 billion has already been unlocked. This isn't a stock split type where price adjusts as the number of stocks you hold increases due to split. In this case taking the current price and multiply that by 6.75 billion ->you'll get the Mcap :)

727 2018-06-10 11:40:25 Currently my local supermarket stocks only tomatoes ‘Made in Morocco’. Which means they may be grown by Moroccan settlers in W. Sahara.

737 2018-06-10 11:23:58 These are the people who invest on stocks by only seeing the CMP and TGT. It is their poor research and they blame others for the failure. #kuch_to_log_kahenge

744 2018-06-10 11:12:44 let “gun control” be regulated by state. red states keep their god damn guns/bump stocks. Blue states can exercise their restrictive preference.

746 2018-06-10 11:08:46 I don’t think we can say that bans don’t work. Full auto weapons are basically banned, and no mass shooters have used them. LV murderer used AR-15 with bump stocks to simulate full auto - because those are legal. Plus, look at other countries w/gun control.

783 2018-06-10 09:57:36 I don’t even know where to start - it’s local U.K. gov policy that lead to selling off and not replacing housing stocks, or closing NHS hospitals/wards in face of increasing aging population. As a remainder I’d rather gov concentrate on that the brexitshambles distraction

830 2018-06-10 08:54:08 Thing I don’t understand by the “Apple have a year to make Mazipan right” comments is that Apple plan to ship Mazipan apps (home, stocks, news) in as little as 3 months with Mojave.

860 2018-06-10 08:02:06 Regulations removed, tariffs in place, TPP gone, Iran deal gone (why support the #1 sponsor of terrorism?), NKSummit today, peace forming, war ending, isis dead, black unemployment all time low, record high stocks, higher approval rating than Obama and Reagan at same point.

The market will keep a close watch on any movement in the rupee, which ended a tad weaker on Friday. IT stocks ended the day in the green as a result.

Crude prices, meanwhile, rose to over USD 75 a barrel, which negatively impacted OMC stocks.

905 2018-06-10 07:09:13 Quite informative. In short, interest rates would peak at the end of winter and stocks would fall and then the summer starts and the things get reversed. Hope my understanding is correct?

912 2018-06-10 06:56:19 @MemphisMeats Hey guys, I'm curious if you've also thought about or attempted lab alternatives for things like fish sauces and stocks, Dashi for instance?
913 2018-06-10 06:56:08 The limit on fish is intended to protect future stocks. Or do you want to get to a stage where the only thing we get to pull from the sea is plastic?
914 2018-06-10 06:55:44 lol  .... no you don’t
All I see is another trump supporter/Obama hater, completely ignoring everything happening in the current administration. Whataboutism is all you know. 
Q: Why did trump not ban bump stocks after he said he would? 
A: #NRA $$
ps, trump doesn’t care aboutU

I hope they at least declare the 1950-3 conflict officially ended, which should've been done decades ago. Despite expected ballyhoo for Korean summit, DJT's tantrum at G7 summit will likely tank stocks.

No one cares if you help ban ir probably help do nothing with bump.stocks. because of bump stocks people are alive today that wouldn't be if Paddock took slow aimed shots. Thank God 4em
940 2018-06-10 06:22:22 The classic rule of a bear market is that most stocks without earnings support fall lower to the level from where they started.

942 2018-06-10 06:19:08 I understand Gamefreak's hesitation in releasing Pokemon amiibo but they are losing money. If they did this stocks would rise AGAIN! People would go crazy for Pokemon amiibo as long as they don't make it hard for us to buy them.

944 2018-06-10 06:16:29 Waiting for “whales” to load something and control the action, when does the music stop? Will you get out in time? That is why I like smaller float, zero dilution stocks.

949 2018-06-10 06:08:47 Besides, expensive stocks have historically underperformed value stocks, but still had positive return. Shorting those as a group is a -EV trade.

951 2018-06-10 06:03:20 You said you don't want to ban guns but banning AR15s and bump stocks bans most rifles. And that would not stop criminals from getting them.

959 2018-06-10 05:49:34 There are stocks that value investors and shortsellers can both rightfully ignore - the too hard pile. They are too uncertain, not necessarily good or bad stocks, but the investor is not equipped to judge. High-valuation stocks fall into that category for many.
960 2018-06-10 05:45:36 But as long as jobs are up. Economy is up. Stocks are up. Conservatives don't care.
961 2018-06-10 05:45:18 Apparently making substantial amounts of money leveraging investments like stocks has become a crime to some people. Strange world we live in, where broke people become the heroes and rich successful people are hated instead of admired.

963 2018-06-10 05:44:30 No, not anti gun.

I'd suggest legislation restricting items such as high capacity magazines & bump stocks at least. Also possible legal requirements regarding storage of the weapon.

I don't have all the answers,but that doesn't mean they don't exist or shouldn't be strived for.
964 2018-06-10 05:42:59 @LAsPlayhouse when you start your sessions with @heartcav3 i suggest you need some stocks and hold a spanking session as she has been very naughty and has a whole line of people who want to spank her. A community service. Curtsy
965 2018-06-10 05:42:13 Start of our second and last day at Thames. We are still running our show special of £10 off all Back on Track mesh coats, stocks are somewhat depleted after yesterday but we still have some  We’ll be leaving shortly after lunch today  so start that shoppping early lol

967 2018-06-10 05:41:03 Stocks fall lower with earnings support or without earnings support?
968 2018-06-10 05:40:29 Get ready for a huge market crash on Monday.

I guess you planned this so you can buy up cheap stocks.
969 2018-06-10 05:36:35 What a perfect use for such beautiful gardens. 
Bring back that time: the genteel art of taking tea in the garden, stolen kisses in the maze, wandering in the rose garden, string quartet in the folly, a sculpture or two peeking out between Stocks & Foxgloves.
970 2018-06-10 05:35:22 While stocks last
971 2018-06-10 05:34:24 Happening the same with 5 out my 6 stocks. Hopefully when the environment is good, things will bounce back!
972 2018-06-10 05:33:57 Not bad for Walmart. I am glad to see them succeed. Loving my stocks too
973 2018-06-10 05:33:45 There are some stocks which are rejected as too expensive due to high pe. All of a sudden eps soars n they become low pe and suddenly they seem cheap
974 2018-06-10 05:33:10 I agree. Plus we are over populated. A lot of our cultural thoughts about raising children for example "child benefit" are actually throw back ideas from the previous generations post war need to refill stocks. In a world where the coming generation will have 5-10 people for
975 2018-06-10 05:29:31 So why do you defend bump stocks and armor piercing bullets.

990 2018-06-10 05:11:43 The problem is his supporters and the Confederate Party don't REALLY care about the American people, this will only start "being bad" when the tariffs start piling up and costing stocks to fall or CEO's to lose money then suddenly you will see Confederates clutch thier pearls.
991 2018-06-10 05:11:43 More important than others ,I try to share what I do to my colleagues & friends & ask them to try & ask what they do in investing. I'm strong believer of ' In learning you grow, in sharing knowledge you course correct & still grow'.

That's 1 reason I put out openly on stocks
992 2018-06-10 05:11:28 Lemme guess...never sell anything, ever. Magically make tons of money and buy awesome stocks and never ever sell them.
Thanks oh wise one.

994 2018-06-10 05:08:39 Food security is not dependent on loss-making farmers, anyways! See the food production and buffer stocks are at all-time high. Better harvests are driving prices down and the Government is already giving huge support prices! Better storage and logistics will improve prices.
995 2018-06-10 05:07:13 Most of the analyst when go wrong advices clients to stay invested for 'loooong Term' and will show fancy examples of the returns of other stocks where ppl stayed invested and gained a lot, analysing quality is very difficult,  don't fall into that trap , take your own call
996 2018-06-10 05:06:07 The shortage of US$ in the market is a natural demand owing, among other reasons, to exporters not converting their US$ quick & not connected to any speculation. State banks had comfortable levels of US$ stocks due to inflows from remittances from migrant workers #lka
997 2018-06-10 05:05:15 You do realize that Bump stocks were actually made legal due to Oblahma, right? True shooters feel they are extremely inaccurate and are actually a little difficult to use. Outside of LV, they have never been a concern either. These "laws" won't change a thing! Pay your taxes!
998 2018-06-10 05:00:34 Please do. Replicating with stocks isn't that cheap.
999 2018-06-10 04:59:13 If you are buying stocks as if world is ending, or as if this is last time to buy or as if great stocks would not be available in future then "100% chances are that you are trapped and buying wrong stocks"

1013 2018-06-10 04:42:37 It will beacuse, in current market conditions people and fund managers are behind good quality stocks so it will not correct more the 10% from high.and if correct then accumulate for trading as well
1014 2018-06-10 04:42:27 Not edge guards*. You held a ledge and got a stock. The other person physically went to the ledge and got shit on. Nah fam. Trumps change the meta in a good way. No more brain dead stocks. Now the recovery sweat spots and the ledge snaps. Thats the issue for this recovery
1015 2018-06-10 04:40:43 Also, don't look for stocks only which is less than 100,500 to invest if there is company you feel will grow in future & its price is in like 5000,10000,15000 etc still invest,you might buy less shares which is OK.

My biggest is: Maruti ,it's CMP 8932/share still I buy.

1026 2018-06-10 04:16:34 The deal to buy the goldmines with funding from the bank was announced on 5 July 2016, 12 days after the referendum. It is not clear if Banks invested, although he tweeted on 17 July 2016 : “I am buying gold at the moment & big mining stocks.”
1027 2018-06-10 04:16:27 Yeah.....criminals are sooooo concerned about bump stocks.
1028 2018-06-10 04:16:09 Bump stocks outlawed would do no good. Most murders are committed with 110.00 dollar throw away guns. Media doesn’t educate you on this.

1035 2018-06-10 04:03:56 If you can't use it to aim at a target, it is not an "arm." It is a toy.

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

Ban bump stocks.

1041 2018-06-10 03:58:28 Ban Bumb Stocks Now
1042 2018-06-10 03:57:29 You can be sure the next Democratic president isn't going to play nice. They'll ban bump stocks, suppressors, hollow points and raise the age to purchase firearms to 25.

Then when you complain, we'll just point out the new president is making up for Obama as you noted.
1043 2018-06-10 03:56:10 It’s fun watching you leftists freak out over nothing while living in near paradise level conditions. Unemployment (if you like how it’s measured) at an all time low. Stocks up. People feeling good. But lefties still have hurt fee fees. 
1044 2018-06-10 03:55:16 Very low on stocks na kami baka mamayang gabi ulam na namin si Nora.
1045 2018-06-10 03:54:24 Buy and hold forever. What a fkn' great advice. #stocks #investment
1046 2018-06-10 03:54:09 When I have a solid lead in Melee, like 3 stocks, I’m like okay easy game I can lay off now. I really gotta get better at keeping pressure on when I have a lead. Although, being put in last stock situations so much has made me pretty good at em
1047 2018-06-10 03:53:58 Such rampant gun violence wasn't happening during the Obama administration. Most people didn't even know what bump stocks were until the Las Vegas massacre.
1048 2018-06-10 03:52:00 I bet the Algorithm Gods are fine-tuning A. I..for Wall Street. Manipulate the market via tweets + 
real world actions by politcians, other public opinion influencers. In a heartbeat, one could tweet, create chaos, identity winning/losing stocks, exploit, cash out.

1050 2018-06-10 03:50:57 In the first 6 mos? That was def still Obama. Shitgibbon’s policies had not yet taken effect. My stocks that were  29% in 2016 are flat now. Don’t try to pull the trump is fixing the economy bs. His policies may be good for the 1% but have been confirmed bad for avg American.
1051 2018-06-10 03:50:06 I dont think anyone would run on banning ALL weapons. We need #GunReform. Expanded background checks ban AR15 & bump stocks. We dont want to take away anyones right to own guns. Its our constitutional right to have them. But they can be better regulated.
1052 2018-06-10 03:48:37 When the ATF reviewed bump stocks in 2012, democrats did not control congress. It was determined that bump stocks didn't violate current laws as written. The 
Was would've had to be changed by congress. They weren't.
1053 2018-06-10 03:47:11 I take it back.  please, go buy buy buy all the stocks you can!  Go mortgage your house and invest invest invest.  Have faith in the Trump economy!  WIN!!!
1054 2018-06-10 03:46:03 I found out that my local Barnes & Noble stocks lots of Arrow/Shout/Vinegar Syndrome/Mondo/Kino blurays! They're pretty expensive because BN but it's cool to see such a big collection on a shelf.
1055 2018-06-10 03:45:02 Listen to more than 1 news channel and you will find that it is you who believes lies. Any economic up tick is due to corporations using the 1.5 trillion dollar gift from taxpayers to buy back stocks. No real economic gain or increase in production. All job growth is from Obama.

1061 2018-06-10 03:36:58 Yep... especially if you have studied it... I tried to explain it to my 30 something financial advisors as I sold stocks and bought 60% bonds and ATT which pays a 6% dividend.. either way I'm balanced.. unless.... I'm thinking take it all out and pay for the taxes..

1063 2018-06-10 03:34:54 Trump promised the high school survivors of the school massacre that he would easily be able to pass a ban on bump stocks and raise the age to buy a gun to 21.  He wasn't afraid of the NRA. Well it's months later and he hasn't passed either. Trump must be afraid of the NRA.

1067 2018-06-10 03:32:05 Most of my stocks are stuck between a weakening market sentiment and strengthening business performance.

I am betting that the sentiment is temporary while the performance is sustainable.

Fy19 will be an interesting year for the markets.
1068 2018-06-10 03:29:52 Could stocks bonds hyperinflate.. sure, yes, possible. can collapse happen too with depts. sure it's real.. hence point include metals in part of diversification..
1069 2018-06-10 03:29:38 By weakening, do you mean the economy? Seems like stocks are really good. Unemployment is substantially low. The economy is better now than it’s been in quite some time. Not sure what is going to fall apart?
1070 2018-06-10 03:28:25 Obama’s year is up.  Biz confidence up, wages up. Unemployment down. Stocks up and level now — which can change.  Trump messing with tariffs could mess us up somewhat. We will wait and see there since we have no choice.

1078 2018-06-10 03:21:56 I am a regular short-seller. Owning something for the short squeeze doesn't work often enough to make it worthwhile.

But shorting high short interest stocks is insanely difficult.
1079 2018-06-10 03:20:01 Why didn't you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA
1080 2018-06-10 03:19:35 We have every right to acoff... after the stunt pulled today..your boss will plunge the American people into a bad depression...bye bye jobs..tac cuts...banking...stocks...
1081 2018-06-10 03:19:27 Gold Silver typically in today's times is HATED. but if stocks bonds plummet.. it will be REAL ASSETS like GOLD SILVER and other HARD assets to rise..
1082 2018-06-10 03:18:05 i cant do it already i fucking damn tired esp w the amt of stocks they have left rn... hopefully we get wat we ordered
1083 2018-06-10 03:15:34 Often experts investments say diversify, & with that same concept , if stocks & bonds plummet, gold silver rises during times of inflation and or deflation and Jim Rickards suggest to have at least part of your investment 10% into Gold Silver.. but I encourage you read his books.
1084 2018-06-10 03:15:01 Write comics, invest in stocks, write an autobiography. If he invests wisely he can probably spend lots of his life just watching the Cubs and Hawks.

Reversing your promise on banning bump stocks. You're a dishonorable liar
1089 2018-06-10 03:13:25 So, like, am I the only person who remembers how “strong” the economy was in 2007 followed immediately by a recession in 2008? You know-with the construction, gasoline prices, housing market, stocks etc....

1094 2018-06-10 03:09:38 I’ll support a restriction on any future purchases of bump stocks, but if you think that’s going to stop violence, you’re an idiot.  It’s truly not a gun issue, it’s a cultural issue.  We allow bullies and glorify violence, yet refuse to allow parents to discipline kids.

1120 2018-06-10 02:28:08 Not my point. I understand the trepidation of banning anything firearm related, as it is seen as a slippery slope, but if you ask most gun owners, they don’t see losing bump stocks as starting setting a precedent. Those that have used them classify them as a novelty!
1121 2018-06-10 02:27:32 CT. Has some of the toughest gun laws and they just added No Bump Stocks.

1144 2018-06-10 01:59:30 No, actually to some common sense gun control (something Trumpsters don't get), not take away your guns, just ban bump stocks, raise the age when someone can purchase the type of rifles that have been used in school shootings...something Trump promised and then back pedaled on.

Plummeting stocks.

Yay..
1162 2018-06-10 01:40:43 Earlier Hani got me to buy stocks and idk what i did 
1163 2018-06-10 01:40:27 But that is not what CNN and MSNBC are reporting.
These media talking heads that are on TV talking down everything didnt see a jump in their pay checks or stock portfolio ?
Talk about 2 faced people.
Hell even Maxine made a bunch on her stocks.
1164 2018-06-10 01:35:52 Yo pierdo $50 en stocks y sufro imagínate perder miles largos o millones como le pasa a muchos 
1165 2018-06-10 01:35:41 If my mom doesn’t tell me to get into trading stocks and to be smart about investing (the money I don’t have) did I even talk to her?
1166 2018-06-10 01:34:23 He did ban bump stocks.
1167 2018-06-10 01:29:36 You're right, the country is going to help. I am retired and my stocks only went up 28%. If Trump was gone I probably would have made 38%. I used to make 10% on my CDs. Now <1%. Let's get back to good old liberalism. How dare Trump give me double personal deductions, I am old

1169 2018-06-10 01:27:25 I don’t consider banning bump stocks infringing my rights, contrary to that, it will help me defend myself against war type fire power
1170 2018-06-10 01:25:42 I am with you on the bump stocks, but what you libs fail to consider on the number of rounds bit, a determined shooter can make up the absence of a high capacity clip, with several low capacity clips.
1171 2018-06-10 01:25:06 and start working on dim stocks 
1172 2018-06-10 01:22:13 Interesting on assumption it was a little boy.  Plus, I loved how the stocks didn’t match in design. 
1173 2018-06-10 01:21:13 I didn't advocate banning bump stocks, or the 2nd amendment. But I appreciate the conversation, and I respect that you have an informed opinion. I hope you haven't felt that I've provoked you, or been rude. I still believe good gun owners are as much under attack as gun Victims.
1174 2018-06-10 01:20:36 No, you see such “Ranger bands” on all kinds of stocks, it’s for sling retention
1175 2018-06-10 01:19:29 @realDonaldTrump #TinyHands #FLEES to Singapore after #COWARDLY interactions @g7 Just like our #NRApuppet agreed to ban bump stocks (until NRA told him not to), #PUTINSPuppet reneged on commitments to G7 group after leaving the scene early!!!

1177 2018-06-10 01:16:11 Absolutely. I never heard of it until the Vegas shooting, and because it allows a gun to act fully automatically, want them banned quickly. And see banning certain mods might be more beneficial in the long run. Like silencers, bump-stocks, flash hiders, extra grips, etc.
1178 2018-06-10 01:10:52 As I begin to look at my finances, I'm realizing that I am HORRIBLE with money... good lord.

But on the good side, I have a great life insurance plan and a few stocks stashed off...
1179 2018-06-10 01:10:31 Yes, we still have stocks at Estancia. See you! :)
1180 2018-06-10 01:09:56 Really? Read Stan Druckenmiller's experience playing the greater fool game with tech stocks in early 2000. "We didn't think it would go down 35% in three weeks". Different bears have different trajectories--tough to say.

1183 2018-06-10 01:05:28 Well for one, neither of them would have had an assault rifle to murder children with. That's a start. Or the kickass that shot up Las Vegas, assault ties WITH bump stocks. That would equate to hundreds of victims being spared. But I'm sure you can't see that through your blinder

1188 2018-06-10 00:54:35 How about actually enforcing what's already on the books? I'm all for stricter background checks, mental health checks if you can get past the hippa part, banning bump stocks/armor piercing ammo.
1189 2018-06-10 00:53:22 Canada and EU are our enemies and  Russia, North Korea are our friends.

I'm bit confused on the stocks and share side.

Your website says 25% then 40% FAQ & on video 40%

So which one is it? 

Need clarify as this will confuse a lot of us!

1218 2018-06-10 00:07:45 From what I gather, Jim Rickards diversifies also in other PGM’s, fine art, some stocks (although speaks wearily of stock equity at times), and cash. “Invest in the things that last.” is a quote I saw him reference before. Personally I like this quote a lot, more than monetary.

1222 2018-06-10 00:05:51 Jack, why would you tell an American to move?  The great thing about our country is we can disagree and voice our opposition.  Bump stocks have no validity in day to day life except to create carnage when used.  I am not talking about taking guns, just reasonable controls.

1225 2018-06-10 00:03:48 Most likely it will be "distributor" driven - all the people & organizations that move those stocks around. Lowering those costs means more profit, which means they can get new business with lower fees, etc. Others must follow eventually, or be left behind. Plus peer pressure.
1226 2018-06-10 00:03:44 I know that stocks will stand

1274 2018-06-09 23:38:02 $1.5 trillion in new debt just so the 1% can buyback stocks at a bargain.  Not to mention rising gas prices, interest on mortgages, credit cards, higher food costs wipe out any tax savings.
1275 2018-06-09 23:36:21 Maniacal, Consumer confidence through roof, stocks same. More jobs now than job seekers (first time in years) pay going up 2.7% last month and 800k warehouse workers highest pay hike in decades -all due to POTUS Trump.
1276 2018-06-09 23:35:15 I agree completely on bump stocks. There should be more regulations on them. I think that the laws that we have for suppressor are ok. But making more laws to tighten isn’t going to help much. Shot these videos on YouTube on how to make a homemade, suppressor.
1277 2018-06-09 23:32:42 Bon balancez vos meilleurs YouTubers parce que j'ai épuisé les stocks de vidéo à regarder.
1278 2018-06-09 23:29:11 I know they don’t “silence” the weapon but the propose it to quiet the sound. Making this more obtainable is similar to seeing bump stocks more accessible, they’re enabling quicker and more efficient killing. Imagine the next school shooting with a guy using a bump stock
1279 2018-06-09 23:27:30 True. And when they say pensions and retirement savings [401k] are invested in stocks they never say fees and charges usual suck up what little return the individuals see from stocks. Only ones making money are those managing the stock.aka the 1%

Please get some common sense and ban bump stocks.
Young people should not have to fear for their lives.

Sincerely, the World.

1292 2018-06-09 23:16:41 I don’t want to be long these stocks while funds are dumping in favor of $loxo, competition is a b*tch in biotech investing, even wrongly perceived competition,
1293 2018-06-09 23:15:23 One of the best way to tax the wealthy are to place small but escalating taxes on, 
* purchase of stocks and bonds
* currency conversions
* cars over $60K
* swimming pools
* gold jewellery
* houses over $2M
* 1st class air travel
* yachts 
You get my drift.
1294 2018-06-09 23:14:29 Facebook IPO first week saw stocks at ($26.81). When Amazon first went public in 1997, its stock was priced at just $18 per share. Twitter priced it's initial offering at $26 per share.  #tezos just saying.....
1295 2018-06-09 23:14:15 Top 4 stocks to watch for the week: $AEP, $AWK, $DTE, $XEL, all may climb w/in 11, 10, 9, 10 days up to 2.4%, 2.3%, 1.6%, 1.7% respectively 
1296 2018-06-09 23:13:16 Come on stocks 
1297 2018-06-09 23:12:52 Twitter real deal might be the highest positive percent change in all my stocks
1298 2018-06-09 23:12:07 Hearing Replay makes me feel 20 again!  #goodtimes #prime
1299 2018-06-09 23:12:04 Putin controlled Rosneft stocks held in a Qatar LLC that will be transferred to a Trump LLC held in the Cayman Islands. This happens once the American Democracy has been scavenged by the traitors and the global thieves... IMHO
1300 2018-06-09 23:11:31 Stocks plunged as Air Products & Chemicals, Inc. unveiled a slight dolphin today.
1301 2018-06-09 23:10:46 Obama is the one who approved Bump stocks but they are being banned by Trump sadly.  They're in mandatory 90 day public comment / review n the ATF .
1302 2018-06-09 23:10:36 @realDonaldTrump Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
1303 2018-06-09 23:09:53 Yea hes clean. Game 3 we were both last stocks at like 38% and he got me with nair nair dair
1304 2018-06-09 23:09:01 Pip-boy, Everybody knows if Trump could find cancer’s cure, he wouldn’t give it to patients. Trump would bribe drug companies to keep it off of the market & his kids would double down pharmaceutical stocks.
1305 2018-06-09 23:07:09 Whenever I visit Ant in NC he always stocks up on dry shampoo, avocados and my favorite snacks and that makes the trip that much better
1306 2018-06-09 23:06:28 Daugherty Auto Sales and Service Mini Stocks (16 cars): H1- Chris Woodard 32, H2- Ray Hyer 10
1307 2018-06-09 23:05:03 Why didn't you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
1308 2018-06-09 23:02:59 Your response was to analogise to public stocks. Even if XRP was a security, it would not follow that it is a publicly traded stock (so your IPO analogy functionless).

Furthermore, that doesn't address the philosophical question of how one should distribute the value they create
1309 2018-06-09 23:01:50 Dear SoCal, for Smash 5 please adjust stocks according to Meta’s cause I’ve seen people lose games before they start lolso no more 2 Stock period.
1310 2018-06-09 23:01:41 Looks like HK prime jumps when equity selloffs happen. If they are long stocks, heavily leveraged housing, they could find stocks down, housing costs up (which they thought could never happen) at the same time. Could get fugly.
1311 2018-06-09 23:00:39 Are you serious Mitch? What about  Ronald Reagan? Large tax cuts to the 1%ers, large tax  cuts to corporations so they can buy back their own stocks instead of wage increases, taking children from their parents! Thats conservative values. I forget GOP only serve the 1% ers.
1312 2018-06-09 22:56:58 It's 'cheap' but I typically stay away from single-asset stocks unless I am convinced there are opportunities to significantly expand resource or if I view them as near-term takeover targets.
1313 2018-06-09 22:55:51 Lol I need to start investing in sum stocks or sumn
1314 2018-06-09 22:51:11 Bump stocks should be a class 2 item. No stricter gun laws. No more government involvement than necessary. @Alyssa_Milano to avoid being a hypocrite, in all sincerity, in the eyes of gun owners. Have your security detail use edged weapons only. No guns period because only cops rt

1316 2018-06-09 22:50:42 im bored should i invest in stocks
1317 2018-06-09 22:50:11 @nixholasstoller@SokeipirimT Good evening Nicholas Stoller, how are you doing? guess great. Anyway, I  am Sokeipirim, all the way Nigeria. just watch your movie Storks. awesome movie, reminds me of God, 2ndly Alhaji Dangote stocks. God bless you. thank you.
1318 2018-06-09 22:48:19 Lyon is in the stock exchange market they cannot have any leaks or false info as it could affect their stocks
1319 2018-06-09 22:47:50 worst jobs record since 2010, GDP growth change under Obama was 10, under Trumpy...1 and the trump toadies cheer. Same with stocks, 148 % increase under Obama...nothing,  Trump's less than 30...awesome. Action he is...grabbing whatever he wants without asking.  you got that right
1320 2018-06-09 22:47:18 Even if it looked like a penis
1321 2018-06-09 22:46:05 Economy is growing just slightly better than it was.  Obama turnaround on GDP was almost 10, trumps is 1,  Stocks increased 148 % under O so bragging about 35 is a bit silly.  Obama brought home 11 hostages. Tax cuts for the rich at the expense of the poor.
1322 2018-06-09 22:45:26 $ICNB if you play penny stocks and don’t at least own some shares of this you need to seriously rethink your entire game plan
Remember why penny stocks run in the first place, especially subbies 
Debt is the only reason this isn’t parked @.10-.15
2018 is the breakout year ICNB
1323 2018-06-09 22:44:31 I will buy your rocket car and stocks.
1324 2018-06-09 22:43:25 What is the 1% decided to sign contracts to sell all of their stocks on the same date that citizens voted them to do so
1325 2018-06-09 22:43:03 Lyon is on the stock market you can’t tell false information as it could affect the stocks
1326 2018-06-09 22:42:59 I love it, but you know the liberals will see stock and want to try to ban it. LOL. Those stocks are so dangerous you know. (Just kidding)
1327 2018-06-09 22:42:42 Well I don't see any distinction, in the law, between "founder" and "employee" for selling publicly traded stocks. Anyway, there are copious reporting and transparency requirements, which I would call "roadblocks" to dumping your shares, if you don't have a contractual lockup.
1328 2018-06-09 22:41:55 Very hype to say I’ve cashed out some of my stocks after just 3 months and purchased a camper 
1329 2018-06-09 22:41:46 Even though some municipal authorities had stocks of stable iodine, they were not distributed.
1330 2018-06-09 22:40:45 Options primarily and stocks second.  Have etrade...tdameritrade both level 3 (option and margin ready) and robinhood (not ideal to exercise options before expiration)
1331 2018-06-09 22:37:50 Just bought some stocks in protest sign manufacturing companies based in Ontario.
1332 2018-06-09 22:37:45 Quatar bought Russian oil stocks for Trump. The deal is still open if sanctions are lifted.
1333 2018-06-09 22:36:08 Debt exploding into the trillions under trump's #GOPTaxScam 

Average citizen is too poor to play the stock market. Corporations are buying back stocks. Nothing to workers. How many people do you know working more than one job to make ends meet? Success for 1% of our population.
1334 2018-06-09 22:35:30 Austin is an eidolon who trades stocks -- but only at night.
1335 2018-06-09 22:33:09 Alright. Are you interested in stocks. Options. Both? Because we have a few options for you.
1336 2018-06-09 22:31:23 Buy stocks in vaseline now!!!!
1337 2018-06-09 22:30:29 Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I am considering a new......
1338 2018-06-09 22:30:02 You mean your portfolio doesn't have helmet making companies stocks in it?
1339 2018-06-09 22:28:59 Does it have weapon variety and customization? Does it have optics, grips, stocks, suppressors and possibly ask if it will have a deeper weapon progression system than BF1. I need more than 4-5 weapons per class + does it have stuff to unlock for those classes.
1340 2018-06-09 22:25:22 Tell me you didn’t think he would go 10’rounds Craig?  He stocks shelves in a Serbian corner store!!
1341 2018-06-09 22:25:16 I only see the eggs and I think a store called World Market stocks them but they import things from around the world so it’s still a specialty good. 
1342 2018-06-09 22:21:54 I'll have to check this out. Gotta see how they feel about my Snead and Andrews stocks
1343 2018-06-09 22:21:40 FUT, stocks, horses - what market are you not in?
1344 2018-06-09 22:20:36 FLORIDA: Florida banned bump stocks #NoRA
1345 2018-06-09 22:18:36 Tyler failed advise into toilet stocks ?!?   
1346 2018-06-09 22:16:23 If you are an investor in US stocks your portfolio has grown by leaps and bounds this past year and a half. My RRSP has never looked better
1347 2018-06-09 22:13:24 Talked to George Soros' answering machine. It said open a position in Brookfield Canada Office Properties $BOXC #Stocks
1348 2018-06-09 22:13:17 Stocks close slightly higher, trimming earlier gains
1349 2018-06-09 22:11:48 You're not making sense--Obama is constitutional law scholar--I don't think he needs to be schooled on how a bill becomes a law.  Trump, on the other hand could benefit from watching School House Rock.  Moreover, he promised to initiate legislation to ban bump stocks.  He lied.
1350 2018-06-09 22:09:57 Thank you Julie! Millions stand with you and see what you spoke of. If we could drag those evil monsters out and throw them in stocks on the mall for stoning we would! They are evil. I pray every day that our strength exceeds evil.
1351 2018-06-09 22:09:44 Contemplating selling my condo, all my belongings and stocks to travel. I understand these places I want to see will always be there. But truth is, I won’t be and in this physical state also.
1352 2018-06-09 22:09:24 Bob, the stock boy. Next he'll tell us he's in "stocks".
1353 2018-06-09 22:07:27 there's an orgia bar and four stocks that regenerate but I'm not 100% sure how it's used yet
1354 2018-06-09 22:05:17 @BluegrassCap @AustinValue do y'all know of any studies on investor batting averages over ten or twenty+ years, ie % of stocks owned that beat inflation over next 3 years, or something like that? My guess is Russo wins but don't know
1355 2018-06-09 22:01:31 @TraceyRyniec listened to your value podcast. I feel $CELG $REGN $GILD are value stocks I own, although Vi got in them for growth :3 Also, do you recommend adding  $MU now?
1356 2018-06-09 22:00:29 OK VILLAGERS!! JUSTIFY!! TRIPLE CROWN ON MY BIRTHDAY! IV GOT EVERYTHING ON JUSTIFY...THE HOUSE ..ALL MY LIFE SAVINGS...MY STOCKS...LYNN DOESNT KNOW...O GOD..GO JUSTIFY!!
1357 2018-06-09 21:58:44 Sure but that's not how publicly traded stocks work.  There are regulations in place to stop a company's founders from just dumping their shares the minute a company goes public.
1358 2018-06-09 21:57:12 Stocks fall and prices rise leaving your suppliers with there head up their arse’s and your customers out in the cold waiting for a rate hike 
1359 2018-06-09 21:53:09 You're confused by the fact that I congratulated you on participating in our system of government by contacting your representatives in order to voice your opinion that you believe that bump stocks should be banned?
1360 2018-06-09 21:52:35 niggas throw a bunch of stocks they found on google on a canvas n start calling themselves an artist
1361 2018-06-09 21:52:17 Re SARS: just because you sell within <3yrs does not mean it is automatically trading. Intent is the deciding factor. Not so easy to prove intent, but if you hold onto most of your stocks for longish periods it is most likely it will be accepted. Make notes on why u are selling.
1362 2018-06-09 21:52:08 Sure, but why do you have such trash stocks like RXII tagged? I suspect you are not really helping
1363 2018-06-09 21:51:11 exactly my point! I started with photoshop in 1997 and i could teach my teenage child how-to do a better photo editing job than this in about 15 to 20 minutes.

Who in the heck is paying the clown  that made image and posted this online with worthless content? #GetFired #ByeBye
1364 2018-06-09 21:48:09 Back in the land of Aus, will pend tonight and tomoz catching up on what has been happening! Had my cyclops eye on the market while away, so have half an idea :) hot tips guys?! Any themes or stocks looking good! Hit me with your best setups, not that I trust any of u anyway!! 
1365 2018-06-09 21:46:17 He should be in stocks in front of Trump tower.
1366 2018-06-09 21:46:09 Im bouta start buying stocks and stack this money 
1367 2018-06-09 21:45:09 Decided to start Trading Stocks in the Stock Market... Who else is in the business?? Tips of the Trade?
1368 2018-06-09 21:43:56 The man has been making deals for over 50 years,trust @realDonaldTrump
1369 2018-06-09 21:42:07 So personally I would like to see vlad stocks be more vlad investments with a little more diversity in avenues of investments.
1370 2018-06-09 21:39:36 Bump stocks should have been charged - g….
1371 2018-06-09 21:38:21 Just because Obama had a pen and phone, does not mean he made laws like he thought he did.  Presidents DO NOT MAKE LAWS!!!!!!!   Want bumb stocks banned contact your reps and make it happen, don't blame someone else for not having the power to do it.
1372 2018-06-09 21:38:21 the stocks should be in a public so everyone can help them celebrate.
1373 2018-06-09 21:38:21 While I appreciate the game you are sharing in vlad stocks, it seems you are very locked in to that being the one valid form of investment. You have a strong bias against anything crypto but aren’t informed on utility backed projects such as @ripple which has strong fundamentals
1374 2018-06-09 21:37:15 Trump said he was going to ban bump stocks and he was going to raise the age to 21. he's just questioning why he didn't go through with his promise.
1375 2018-06-09 21:34:40 Thankful for this weekend to kick it and sip on something good! No stocks. Whats everyone up to?!
1376 2018-06-09 21:34:02 Eh. I had shares in Carillion last year, which dropped from 200p to 14p. People still invest in stocks.

Also, you underestimate the power of people seeing potential massive gains that other people are getting and FOMOing in.
1377 2018-06-09 21:31:47 Bump stocks are also not an NFA item, that is why the ATF deemed they could not regulate them. Therefore, Congress must take action if they do not want bump stocks on the market.
1378 2018-06-09 21:30:35 Nasdaq hustle bitch, come get your ass some stocks
1379 2018-06-09 21:30:09 I would work until I had health and life insurance set up so I didn’t have any period where I was not covered. Also getting it set up in a bank, stocks, bonds, etc with my financial advisor. And once I started getting interest payments I would quit.
1380 2018-06-09 21:28:05 The Lock stocks are world class, only department with quality depth.
1381 2018-06-09 21:26:40 If you can’t buy a 30 or 60 round magazine you can’t use one in a mass shooting.  If you can’t buy bump stocks you can’t use them. If you have mental health issues and aren’t allowed to buy guns you can’t use them in a shooting.
1382 2018-06-09 21:26:03 Bump stocks are nothing more than a gimmick and the creator of the bump stock is stopping production. But I can take a wooden dowel & do the same thing as as a bump stock, are we going to ban wooden dowels?
1383 2018-06-09 21:25:44 Oil stocks will crash in this weekend. Not exactly.　　石油株は今週末に暴落するだろう。いや、そうでもないよ。
1384 2018-06-09 21:24:55 Luv how madz doesn’t know that’s a song.
1385 2018-06-09 21:24:47 I’ve fired many guns... everything from pistols, shotguns, AR-15, etc. I think we should ban bump-stocks, raise the purchase age to 21 and more. Why are people so against sensible gun laws? Why does the average person need an AR-15?
1386 2018-06-09 21:24:09 Language bud
1387 2018-06-09 21:23:38 What will I trade today...?

1388 2018-06-09 21:22:53 I’m pretty sure not allowing people with mental health issues to have guns it’s not a violation to the 2A, or people not having Bump Stocks.
1389 2018-06-09 21:22:04 Why do EVEREST DOUBLE GLAZING build 15 year obsolescence into their windows by having unique handles nobody else stocks & they discontinue. Who needs new double glazing after 15 years?
1390 2018-06-09 21:21:39 Arron Banks tweeted on 17 July 2016 : “I am buying gold at the moment & big mining stocks.” 
#TheGuardian
1391 2018-06-09 21:20:31 You have a prob of 50% on guessing price action of a stock correctly i.e up or down. The Stokpix model predicts price action correctly 67% of the time. If you use the Stokpix model on Industrials, Financials or Services that increases to >70% correct. #stocks
1392 2018-06-09 21:20:25 False bravado all the way to the stocks I guess.
1393 2018-06-09 21:19:58 trading monopoly money liek penny stocks. ez gaem
1394 2018-06-09 21:19:41 GOP “robbing hoods” zeroes not heroes for making a token faux appearance of trying to “save” taxpayer money by taking away from programs for the poor after just running deficit up over a trillion by giving the rich unfunded tax cuts used to buy back stocks instead of create jobs.
1395 2018-06-09 21:17:56 With tax breaks helping some, stocks for now rising, and possible agreement with Kim on horizon the only hope for the sanity of our nation will come down to Mueller. A Sept or early Oct shocker, as with Comey’s Hillary speech, could rid us of a lot of dead wood.
1396 2018-06-09 21:15:53 An index account is basically like stocks that match a certain index the s&p 500 for example is an index! The stock market has averaged 10% growth for 100 years! If you buy into an index it will be similar to one that keeps track of stocks! There are many ways to do it. I do ETFs
1397 2018-06-09 21:15:42 FAANG refers to a basket of high-technology growth stocks — Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google — that have led the bull run of the last nine years. Those five stocks now represent 50 percent of the market cap of the Nasdaq 100 index. ~ @CNBC $AMZN $AAPL $NFLX $GOOG
1398 2018-06-09 21:14:50 Hani over here teaching me stocks.
1399 2018-06-09 21:13:11 Look at stocks and bonds trends. Rip stocks and bonds
1400 2018-06-09 21:10:11 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
1401 2018-06-09 21:09:34 May b wat u are sayin is right for bad stock..  But as of nw thr is too thin a line between bad & gud stock in midcap & smallcap.. Gud stocks in ths distress market in small & midcap can give multibagger returns.. As it's said gud news n gud price never comes together..
1402 2018-06-09 21:08:25 After cussin StitchFix for weeks, stocks go up $5 in one day. Almost sold 
1403 2018-06-09 21:07:30 Ok I don’t know. Plenty of penny stocks out there. I figured it’s on the appropriate exchange already.
1404 2018-06-09 21:07:17 Like trying to walk back health coverage for poor with pre-existing health conditions to make up for almost trillion unfunded tax cuts given to corporations with pre-existing conditions of record profits and record cash on hand who are using $ to buy back stocks not create jobs?
1405 2018-06-09 21:06:01 What are you talking about. He has improved on everything. My stocks are the best ever, one of our kids got some of the "crumbs", $1,000 bonus and a raise. My sweet old uncle was finally able to get some medical help.
1406 2018-06-09 21:05:16 Banning  the possession of bump stocks, and allowing police to seek a court order to seize guns from anyone deemed an extreme risk. This is some of the sensible gun laws I support.
1407 2018-06-09 21:04:44 Problem is no one can tell you what those good stocks are. Instead financial houses want to lock you into schemes that you need to sell your kidney to get into.
1408 2018-06-09 21:02:51 It’s not up to him to ban bump stocks or raise the purchase age. The ban and age limit would be up to the legislative branch of the government. See they pass a bill Trump is the elected leader of the executive branch. He would sign that bill into law. Did you miss Civics class?
1409 2018-06-09 21:02:43 What’s crazy is the Starbucks ceo said he was stepping down and the stocks dropped as soon as he announced it.
1410 2018-06-09 21:02:19 Even better when you can buy and hold good stocks with combined income…
1411 2018-06-09 21:02:00 Trust me I am. And taking a few people with me. Between a few good stocks and some great coins. Plus a new way of looking at assets. It's all just a matter of time. Short time too.
1412 2018-06-09 21:01:59 ion wanna be iced out jewelry rich, I wanna be I got stocks in Apple rich,
1413 2018-06-09 21:01:49 He mentions bump stocks.. He knows alot about guns.. WTF are you talking about
1414 2018-06-09 21:01:37 @tombarwelljb remember when you and stocks forgot the equipment during first few days of pre season, comps beasted you both  
1415 2018-06-09 21:01:15 May all his stocks go down.
1416 2018-06-09 21:00:58 By the way, think about this one Matt. If they do ban bump stocks and even raise the legal age to buy a firearm to 21, do you honestly think that a person in a gang won’t buy a gun from their buddy, whether they are 21 or not?
1417 2018-06-09 21:00:53 Buy and hold GOOD stocks. That’s how you fast track it.
1418 2018-06-09 20:59:45 Long term I'm thinking  water stocks
1419 2018-06-09 20:59:22 No they haven’t.. stocks with buybacks underperformed.. earnings kept pace with the rally.. QED
1420 2018-06-09 20:59:04 Greg, what stocks should I invest in?
1421 2018-06-09 20:58:37 It didn’t crash. However while both stocks and employment continue to improve incrementally, both grew at a faster rate under Obama.
1422 2018-06-09 20:57:43 If you can't get a bump stock, You could use a belt loop or a 3D printer to make as many as you wanted, this law against bump stocks will just create a bigger black market Alyssa.
1423 2018-06-09 20:55:17 Good thing we got rid of those bump stocks no one had ever heard of till LV!
1424 2018-06-09 20:55:17 Soooo Stocks going???? #NeverTrump 
1425 2018-06-09 20:54:00 ”Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?”
1426 2018-06-09 20:53:42 ”Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?”
1427 2018-06-09 20:53:24 ”Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?”
1428 2018-06-09 20:51:56 Ban bump stocks!
1429 2018-06-09 20:51:54 Yo so what have you been doing? Ecommerce? Day trading stocks? Affiliate marketing?
1430 2018-06-09 20:51:04 A bump stock doesn’t make your rifle illegal, or banned. Bump stocks are hardly a niche market accessory as is, so you’re just playing hysterics.
1431 2018-06-09 20:50:50 I’ll give something up when the liberals give something up. National Reciprocity & hearing SAFE act for bump stocks, you have a deal.
1432 2018-06-09 20:50:07 So who will you sell to once it becomes obvious that economy is in the tank? Everyone else will see it at same time that you see it. Won't be any buyers anywhere near these prices at that point. That's why stocks always top when economy is rosy. Mid-2000, mid-2007 felt wonderful.
1433 2018-06-09 20:50:06 In brawl, theres only really 1 way you can die at 20 (getting stage spiked by shuttle loop which u should never get hit by). In smash 4, there are soooo many ways, and it's so match deciding, being only 2 stocks
1434 2018-06-09 20:50:03 fuck owning stocks
1435 2018-06-09 20:47:36 They'll CRY, and sell off all of their stocks
1436 2018-06-09 20:47:25 Here's the stupidity of that argument.  Bump stocks were designed for handicapped people.
1437 2018-06-09 20:46:04 Prisons stocks have been going up by leaps and bounds for many years now......and Trump has prison reform on his to do list.....he knows its a mess.....but he has a lot on him plate...give it a little time.....he's done a lot already and will do more.
1438 2018-06-09 20:45:00 1. Buy some appartments in high rented area, put them on rent.(Passive income).
2. Investment in Stocks, Bonds and Mutual fund (Portfolio income).
3. Join some courses and seminar  on investment and financial independence (Learning).
1439 2018-06-09 20:44:14 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
1440 2018-06-09 20:43:52 Ban bump stocks

1444 2018-06-09 20:39:22 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?”
1445 2018-06-09 20:38:57 Why do the level 1 CPUs have so many stocks on you are you ok mang0
1446 2018-06-09 20:38:03 Dude led Euroleague in PER, was the league’s MVP. Every other 19 year old prospect before him barely played. They sat behind the veterans. Their draft stocks were based on guessing and potential.
1447 2018-06-09 20:37:18 Why didn't you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
1448 2018-06-09 20:37:17 Duh he already did ban bump stocks. Not that it will actually help matters though.
1449 2018-06-09 20:35:08 Upper right and lower left are not images of bump-stocks.
1450 2018-06-09 20:35:02 Why didn't you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
1451 2018-06-09 20:32:22 NJ banned bump-stocks. Nobody turned them in.  I guess all those defiant  owners who resent having $200 property stolen from them deserve their doors kicked in and kids flash-banged over something a mass killer can build with screws, scrap metal, and a Dremel in an hour.
1452 2018-06-09 20:31:54 The Dow remains active, people working, construction spending, buying & building homes, cars, vacationing, Airports busy. I continue to see Hedge Funds buying large blocks of stocks especially when at discount prices. I see the Dow climbing before last quarter of this year.
1453 2018-06-09 20:31:48 since Wednesday, June 6, I have started to sell all my tech-based stocks, tech-related funds and more...often, they have made 100% in one year. I put the money in my pocket and leave the (poker) table...If tech rises another 20%, I'll build a short on techs....
1454 2018-06-09 20:30:24 Most gun owners favored further regulation of bump stocks.  Legislative action is unnecessary and can be counterproductive @Alyssa_Milano
1455 2018-06-09 20:28:51 And dial also only added 2 leave stocks to the exact same faze header tho
1456 2018-06-09 20:28:21 And don't forget how many stocks are foreign owned...
1457 2018-06-09 20:27:32 4:30am  done w our stocks inventory  

GOOD-TO-GO! ready for shipment and meet-up.. gudnyt!
1458 2018-06-09 20:27:24 Pokud by to byla pravda, tak by agrofert bez navýšených dotací zkrachoval. To jsem rád, že vím, na co jdou naše daně. Jinak je pro mě podstatnější, jak jsem psal, že místo skutečných zlepšení pouze PR volební sliby.
1459 2018-06-09 20:25:19 Companies used the TaxBill scam to buyback stocks at the highest levels ever seen benefiting the rich.  

10% of Americans own 80% of all stock shares. The bottom 80% of earners own just 8%.

All Republicans have done is make the rich-richer & driven up the deficit another 2T.
1460 2018-06-09 20:25:01 Protecting yourself doesn't require bump stocks that transform your AR-15 into a banned automatic rifle.
1461 2018-06-09 20:24:57 Yawwwwwwwwwnn!! Why are their stocks up with matches like this?? Take Roman off TV with a worked injury please!!
1462 2018-06-09 20:24:35 اسال الله القادر  ان يجزي كل شركة استولت على اموال المسلمين بهذا الشكل المزري ونزلت اسعار اسهمها بين تخفيض واحتيال للاستيلاء ع المتبقي تدريجيا واقول لهم لقد وثق بشركاتكم من وثق فخنتوا الثقة والامانه ولازلتم في ابراجكم تتنعمون بحرمة اموال المسلمين فليتق الله من لدبه ضعافا صغارا
1463 2018-06-09 20:24:24 its only due to people like you that help me make so much money on stocks before you commented did you think to at least look at the landscape?
1464 2018-06-09 20:24:13 As I have said a thousand times, no manipulation can put stocks down and keep them down.

1466 2018-06-09 20:23:45 Alyssa is clueless, Bump Stocks can be made in a Garage, Banning their sale won't prevent Bump Stock Use. #GunControl #2A
1467 2018-06-09 20:21:16 Try investing in CXSE.  It has all the big China stocks not State owned.
1468 2018-06-09 20:20:44 Rachel forced me to sign up for stocks through Starbucks like two months ago and I have already made so much... thank you sis
1469 2018-06-09 20:20:35 They is the dumb-a$$es that could not manage a positive PR campaign. Which includes perception from all online sources and social media outlets being used to "promote" the service, as well as $HMNY by responding to negative PR by $AMC that is trying to making this company fail.
1470 2018-06-09 20:19:39 Of course, that's assuming they sold tomorrow. If they do like I do with stocks, after the run ends, the bandwagon fans flee and they're in the cellar, they'll sell it for $900m. A stomach turning 100% gain. Only difference being I usually sell at a loss.
1471 2018-06-09 20:18:44 I would pay off my school loans, clean up my credit, buy a house, a car suv & put some it to stocks & bonds, my kids will get some money & some very close friends.
1472 2018-06-09 20:15:11 Start with curiosity about the world.
Use basic math.
Save more than you spend.
Have fun finding stocks & own them.
Diversify broadly.

1474 2018-06-09 20:12:56 @option_snipper do you think rate hike could hurt some stocks next week, more specifically $NVDA?
1475 2018-06-09 20:12:48 I bet they had tons of evidence against the Roosevelts, Rothschilds, and all the other fat cats reaping millions from dividends off munitions stocks. And they couldn't convict anybody for murdering the people around the world too!
1476 2018-06-09 20:11:56 I liked the three stocks u discussed is SBI for 270 n reliance cap above 424 levels n  glenmark for 572!....
1477 2018-06-09 20:11:36 ... until the coming collapse in Stocks & Bonds signals the end days..
1478 2018-06-09 20:08:56 Not vegan. Plastics are already out there. Better to try and find toothbrushes made from recycled plastic than kill a boar to keep your teeth clean!  And those veggies flown in to the Inuit? They are already there, while fish stocks continue to plummet.
1479 2018-06-09 20:08:39 Start a charity

Buy mama a house

1480 2018-06-09 20:05:39 Edakun, $1,000.
These stocks won’t trade on copulation.
1481 2018-06-09 20:03:13 Picked up a bargain pair of TNF walking trousers @CotswoldOutdoor #Carlisle today, but really disappointed to find that the shop now stocks more gear, books etc than clothing
1482 2018-06-09 20:01:52 Make sure you have plenty of water and stocks of food, your wait will be a long one 
1483 2018-06-09 20:00:22 Great pick! Chinese stocks seem to be on fire lately!
1484 2018-06-09 19:58:14 Its not easy, coming from chatrooms where youre just watching scanners all day long and focusing onto 1-2 pennystocks that are mostly selling of at open and not knowing anything whats happening with real stocks. Getting rid of old bad habits is harder than I thought
1485 2018-06-09 19:56:49 The problem is, the fan reaction to the games today was not good. And this is a repeat problem for EA, and now that they're declaring "no more loot boxes!", aka, a constant revenue stream, I expect those stocks to drop as investors say fuck this.
1486 2018-06-09 19:56:22 @funder @Potus continues to take the world by Storm.   Are you mad because he wants to fix an 830 Billion trade deficit.   He’s actually doing all he promised.  You like 830 bill in trade deficits? High unemployment? Flat stocks?  TFWrong w you?
1487 2018-06-09 19:56:21 11€ en fin de journée pour écouler les stocks de la veille, faudrait pas trop rogner sur les marges.
1488 2018-06-09 19:55:54 A massive THANK YOU to everyone who came to and helped to make today’s summer fair such a lovely event... organising, donating, setting up and tidying away, running stalls and getting wet in the stocks! The total made was £4,529.97 which is fantastic  
1489 2018-06-09 19:52:47 You nailed my main struggle which is being overwhelmed with good possible plays. This is a good problem to have. Sometimes its hard to narrow down the focus just to 2-3 stocks at the open.
1490 2018-06-09 19:50:13 Being able to defend yourself is a right, being able to purchase 49 guns with bump stocks is not a right.
1491 2018-06-09 19:49:21 I’ve actually written my dept up for certain stock outs.  Just this week actually because our operations manager was patting himself on the back for refilling stocks outs in < 90 mins. 
1492 2018-06-09 19:48:02 Buy a house, donate for mental health and foster children, invest on stocks, create a college fund for my daughter, and capitalize on a business plan.
1493 2018-06-09 19:47:00 I have a lot of experience in my background with legislative processes and political campaigns. There's a very powerful way to get bump stocks and assault weapons banned throughout the u.s. and territories under its jurisdiction... and also red flag laws. The NRA is beatable.

1501 2018-06-09 19:35:19 Can't believe I'm saying this, but come on Monday. I'm ready for the market to be open again and stocks to be trading. Next week is gonna be exciting. #stockhustle.

1516 2018-06-09 19:18:09 Ban bump stocks and AR-15’s.
1517 2018-06-09 19:16:38 Being a single mom of a special-needs child is not an excuse but my biggest asset. Ive been running a reselling business over a year, growing a blog, and started investing in stocks. I started with nothing but a fire to build something great for my little family #sneakersaturday
1518 2018-06-09 19:15:00 Big companies buying back stocks - not one of the scenarios discussed by Ryan, McConnell or Trump; Harley Davidson is headed overseas; the legislation won't pay for itself and if not a corp. or super rich person we get the privilege of paying higher taxes while GOP donors prosper
1519 2018-06-09 19:11:57 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
1520 2018-06-09 19:10:09 First-quarter earnings were up over 24%, and #stocks are driven by earnings. My early predictions seem to be on point. And others seem to be agreeing with me as well.
1521 2018-06-09 19:06:11 Whoever gives a 5-year-old a harmonica as a gift should be put in stocks.
1522 2018-06-09 19:05:57 anyone who thought that it would be a good idea to buy stock in movie pass is bad at their job and pretty dumb.

1524 2018-06-09 19:04:25 EA stocks dropping in 3...2...
1525 2018-06-09 19:03:38 m8 you might be good at streaming and do alright in the stocks but my guess is you never made a game. Investing everything in something like this is without some more research is terrible idea. What if the game becomes boring for you next week?
1526 2018-06-09 19:03:21 Now, I support stricter background/mental health checks, banning bump stocks/armor piercing ammo, gun safety classes, and not allowing those guilty of domestic abuse to have guns. Also I think law enforcement/FBI needs to investigate when reported.
1527 2018-06-09 19:02:59 But you can lose your years savings in the market if you don't know how to play it. Start with small bets and learn the tricks as you go. Avoid Kachra stocks and patiently build your pf over the years. Without good risk tolerance never dare to invest in market
1528 2018-06-09 19:02:10 But then again, this convo wasn’t about bump stocks but your claim that smaller magazines won’t save a life.  Those are the facts I’d like to see you prove.
1529 2018-06-09 19:00:48 1’000,000 for me, 9’000,000 in investments: stocks - short and long term. Crypto, venture capital, and a profitable traditional business . 7 different income streams

1531 2018-06-09 18:59:43 Sir for screening all the f&o stocks at a time ?? Wch is the best screener software ???
1532 2018-06-09 18:58:50 Yet u haven’t given me one solid fact.  That is all I’ve asked for.  For all I know, maybe u know or have spoken to every single person in CO & they’ve confirmed to u that they did not turn in bump stocks great, now prove that u did.  If u are ruled by facts then show me some.
1533 2018-06-09 18:57:20 I'm just going to go ahead assume you're autistic
1534 2018-06-09 18:55:03 Okay, fair, but I still think it’s good in some situations, especially when there’s a significant gap in skill level. If the same person is consistently losing all their stocks before anyone else it can get kind of boring for them.
1535 2018-06-09 18:54:10 Also. It is currently one of the most shorted stocks on Nasdeq / NYSE. I believe it's 40mil shares short. When the squeeze happens. And it will eventually he could sell then and break even or a small gain. But to sell cause it's down is crazy. When he could get 5$ daily in 3 days
1536 2018-06-09 18:54:06 Buy enough stocks and bonds so i keep on getting a couple hundred thousands a month for the rest of my life B-)
1537 2018-06-09 18:52:37 I might just make a group with 25 persons in it and we group up money and start make some serious cash from these stocks because this is honestly too easy...
1538 2018-06-09 18:52:15 What world would that be?  It sure as hell is not Earth.  The world is appalled at Trumps stupidity.  He has turned us into laughing stocks.
1539 2018-06-09 18:52:06 Taking a 50% loss because the stocks been shorted / naked shorted down hard doesn't make sense. As a company, they are doing things right. There are alot of good reads out there about potential, and as to why the price has sunk down as bad as it has. The ATM has been pushed down
1540 2018-06-09 18:52:02 Portfolios are DFA Equity Balanced Strategy for stocks and DFA Five-Year Global Fixed for short-term bonds; so there’s a bias to my data: the portfolios are incredibly good, not just basic index funds....
1541 2018-06-09 18:50:59 I support responsible gun ownership. The irresponsible parents should be charged for something, but not sure if they should be tried for murder. I'm good with stricter background checks/mental health checks, ban bump stocks/armor piercing ammo.
1542 2018-06-09 18:50:22 Man, @SudarMuthu’s mustache is like a fine wine that just gets better with age
1543 2018-06-09 18:49:49 @POTUS  >>> MR. PRESIDENT >>>  do not negotiate Americans food supplies away to North Korea and don't let China lock America into a contract to buy America's food stocks either.  If we fail they will sue us in international courts and win.
1544 2018-06-09 18:49:06 He say a lot of stuff that sounds good on paper but doesn’t work in real life, he is dangerous to this society...you can own a piece of a company, it’s called buying stocks which means you don’t spend beyond your means so you save some money and invest.
1545 2018-06-09 18:46:53 #EA, je vais vous redire la même chose que je dis chaque année, mais : refaites des versions "street" de vos jeux, et je pillerai littéralement vos stocks.

1546 2018-06-09 18:46:46 We have that which is called stocks, and bonds.

1549 2018-06-09 18:44:07 @POTUS  Mr. President, if in your negotiations you give away Americas foods stocks to aid N. Korea, you must look at the global grain production and it's failing quantity and quality.  Look at global crop failures.  PLEASE do not give Americas food or energy away & relieve China
1550 2018-06-09 18:43:12 People think making money from stocks is a pickney thing lol, only volatile stocks are good for making money and you have to have a lot of money to start with to make a lot unless the company blows up

1554 2018-06-09 18:36:59 Had wee Nic. lived 200 years ago she'd have spent her time in the stocks being pelted with rotten eggs.
1555 2018-06-09 18:35:39 Yeah they are bashing every stock you own, because they are all MONSTER's. They don't bash, shit hole stocks my friend. So be thankful that people are even bashing your stocks, and for ME of course for getting you in em all!! #Beastmode #AAGC #BONZ #BIOAQ #CMGO #SGDH #TGODF #BVTK
1556 2018-06-09 18:35:19 Since Clinton repealed The Glass-Steagall Act, stocks mainly work for billionaires who get bailouts from taxpayers. Now the Trump administration is repealing Dodd-Frank too! The next bubble will burst soon.

1569 2018-06-09 18:28:51 Love that stuff. It makes it so obvious that there is serious accumulation. Not Uncle Bob and Aunt Sue buying but the big guys and they are the ones who move these stocks for big gains. We just need to identify react and ride the wave.

1576 2018-06-09 18:21:01 What's the difference between the (president??) of Lyon saying he's staying and a club statement both could be utter bullshit to keep the stocks up
1577 2018-06-09 18:19:02 Bump stocks serve not purpose but to allow shooters to kill more victims.  Ban them now!
1578 2018-06-09 18:14:55 It’s Saturday an I have the day off time to study some stocks
1579 2018-06-09 18:13:26 Danny, it's because we know the whole thing is a facade. First you'll take bump stocks and AR-15s. When that doesn't accomplish your goals, you'll go after all semi-automatic handguns. When that doesn't do the job, then you'll go after all the rest of the guns. We see through you

1582 2018-06-09 18:07:50 you might not directly be against the 2A, but that’s how things will turn out. Ban bump stocks, then stricter and stricter till guns are completely banned. A snowball effect.
1583 2018-06-09 18:05:25 As a follow up to my comment. I would recommend of course paying off all your debt and investing in a passive income first before getting a depreciating asset. Something like a property or a business investment. Also diversify into stocks and other things.
1584 2018-06-09 18:04:52 Realtor commissions are truly absurd; all for a discount real estate system similar to the discount brokerages for stocks.  Real estate is a commodity to be traded like everything else.
1585 2018-06-09 18:04:35 Attempted @michelrouxjr gratin de langoustines au piment d’Espelette (sans escargots as we couldn’t get any but added cod instead) as a main with pasta tonight. Obviously not Michelin level but really tasty. Home cream & butter stocks somewhat diminished though!

1593 2018-06-09 17:57:26 With respect, ignoring the actual issues is an incredibly bad idea.  Senator Smith promotes this horrible sulfide mining.  Mr. Painter does not.  Smith will not commit to Single Payer.  Painter has.  Tina Smith owns Medical Device stocks and will not divest.  Painter does not.

1599 2018-06-09 17:49:07 you would think the common sense gun law would be don't murder and don't mss shoot..
 but you keep focusing on bump stocks and making it difficult for free American citizens to execute their right to firearms..
1600 2018-06-09 17:47:13 Right, she was only gonna try to deregulate banks and stocks, keep amazon tax free, and keep moving money away from the working class. Totally different from trump

1606 2018-06-09 17:41:51 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?

1611 2018-06-09 17:39:03 Time is better for free-for-alls, since you can't just win by running away and letting everyone else wear each other's stocks.  It's far better for party matches.

1615 2018-06-09 17:38:06 Well then we all stuffed because #BTC has no underlying asset. Utility found in #aws seemed to drive the #AMZN price? Again you views are bias because you support your market. Saying BTC is a store of value, but it can't handle the volume. Tech stocks are safer beat.
1616 2018-06-09 17:35:55 I use the tax code and perks of family and community to fund 529s, Roths, stocks to avoid taxes, teach my kids to do it.  Know who to consult with. I had an intact family, good diet, parents who read.  Religion and education can help folks learn how to be upper middle class.
1617 2018-06-09 17:35:41 Sorry, but that's not true at all. Governments not only borrow money to add to their spending but also invest heavily in stocks, bonds, hedge funds, etc.. This is why MOST governments are HEAVILY in debt....
1618 2018-06-09 17:34:16 just like stocks no different
1619 2018-06-09 17:33:54 That's how they make their money and establish the losing curve like stocks - they have the teams to manipulate and rig it like the Plunge Protection Team
1620 2018-06-09 17:33:05 Several high quality stocks are looking increasingly attractive. Will certainly keep an eye on 3M and J&J!!
1621 2018-06-09 17:33:02 But what i dont see is an investment fund changing 500 MM USD for gold and saving it at home. I see those funds focusing more their portfolios in etf of gold, silver and stocks of gold mining companies. If i am wright i think i should do the same. I am wright? @alexstanczyk
1622 2018-06-09 17:32:37 Not to mention that it was clear Thatcher had tactically retreated the first time round, in order to prepare: build up coal stocks, police, law, etc to buttress Givt making it very unlikely Miners could win. But to the far left heroic defeat was better than compromise & survival?

1635 2018-06-09 17:15:53 This is interesting.  I think it depends on a variety of factors.  Like saying all securities are stocks, they are not.  Bonds are not stocks but they are securities, CMO's are neither stock nor bond but are securities.  It's premature to declare one superior at this point!

no GN option. GN would imply thicker cover stock.
48 pager, 56 pager, 60 pager, etc. are all saddle-stitched still. same cover and paper stocks as a 32 pager.
1642 2018-06-09 17:07:38 True not all are a Ponzi i would say stocks without dividends (most of them) rely on a Ponzi effect in order to ascertain their value. Average Joe investing believes if he has Google stock and Google makes profits they will get a % of that & don't realize this is not the case.

1657 2018-06-09 16:58:21 So how much stocks one must have in his portfolio?

1661 2018-06-09 16:53:21 Look at it from a strategic stand point first the bump stocks which no one really cares about then they'll go after the ar15 and other semi auto rifles and they won't stop until they have everything except maybe muzzleloaders

1668 2018-06-09 16:42:50 The Stockmarket will crash soon, and hard.  Stocks have never been this inflated, overvalued and abstract.  It's overdue and perhaps no bail out this time, with further borrowings.

1717 2018-06-09 16:04:35 i have $IQ in one of my accounts and my only regret was not buying more under $22.  This is one of those stocks where everyone is saying they are looking for a pullback to add. That usually translates to small pull backs and bigger runs.  we'll see how it goes.

1723 2018-06-09 15:56:25 Good answer! So maybe it’s just a time frame issue? If I had to pick stocks that I thought would go up over the next few months I’d throw out our whole approach and just pick based on momentum.
1724 2018-06-09 15:56:15 Need to bring back stocks and put people in them for 24 hrs in the city centre. Will help with footfall for the shops too, I’d certainly turn up and pelt the disgusting bastards.

1726 2018-06-09 15:55:39 I think nobody has figured out why 98% of stocks will go up to the right value within three years, but the percentage is much lower for going down to value. Pabrai wrote about smart overvalued stock mngmt can just issue expensive equity until the cash gets them to fair v
1727 2018-06-09 15:54:31 But the good thing is we the people have the control.

FY19: 28%
FY20: 18%
FY21: 14% 

It is a large cap stock and if that stock is delivering 20% odd returns per year vs other underperforming large cap stocks then its a super large cap pick

1735 2018-06-09 15:48:15 (1/2) Investment managers fear they’ll lose business if they stand too far apart from the crowd, preventing them from buying stocks selling at low prices, small-cap stocks or stocks of companies that don’t pay dividends or are losing money.
1736 2018-06-09 15:48:03 yes, we shall make that attempt. Model portfolio is in that direction. I will set the weightage also in the model portfolio. Keep tracking the model portfolio as I will keep adding stocks in it.

1744 2018-06-09 15:41:21 Yes, various factors come into determining what is a good trade. A "breakout" by itself means nothing unless there are people (volume) present to react to it. Tons of stocks "breakout" but majority of them aren't in play at a particular moment.

1748 2018-06-09 15:38:07 Are liberals growing tired of America winning.  Trump promised some people would grow tired from so much winning.  Jobs, wages, stocks, consumer confidence is all way up. ISIS, MS-13 and Dems way down.

1752 2018-06-09 15:35:55 Good stocks
1753 2018-06-09 15:33:30 Yes, because record jobs, stocks and consumer confidence is bad.  Because destroying ISIS and MS-13 hurts America.  You’re not too bright.
1754 2018-06-09 15:33:04 I recently saw a presentation covering supposedly safe consumer staple stocks.  It showed that Kellogg's, Campell's Soup and Gillette have been price gouging and have failed to innovate.  A similar story for Schweppes and helps explain #FEVR's success at taking market share.

1762 2018-06-09 15:25:39 Stocks rarely perform in the time frames we predict, & it’s why the market only works for investors having long-term focus. Performance is never linear, up and to the right, year after year. You sometimes have to hold a position for few years before it goes up 100% in 3 months.
1763 2018-06-09 15:25:01 Agreed but I hardly think appealing to some fairy tale "better nature" of an oligarchy whose stated goal is to reduce the population of the world to a number sufficient only to keep THEM in pampered luxury (they WANT you dead) will work. Buy pitchfork stocks NOW!

1767 2018-06-09 15:20:30 Same reason penny stocks do.  Cost to run network exceeds assets.  Then painting goes to bankruptcy auction but there is still a 51% owner of the painting and what kind of rights does that 51% owner have. Can he choose where it’s auctioned.  Can he buy it back at a cheaper price?
1768 2018-06-09 15:17:36 Just remembered something. I wonder if @mcuban pulled his money out of the stock market. I really hope he did and then have to buy all the stocks back at a higher rate.

1775 2018-06-09 15:11:04 Stocks are barely up this year even with peak earnings because of the balance sheet Unwind IMO.
QE and bond buying programs bid credit markets, forced yield chasing, stimulated housing and also created equity buying. We disagree if you don’t think monetary policy impacts equities

Someone had a pic of him, zoomed in on his left cheek and saw what looked like skin cancer.
1782 2018-06-09 15:09:03 QE eliminated the left tail of deflationary risk at the right time.. so in a sense it did support equities by cutting off an extreme outcome from the probability distribution.. but that’s about it.. stocks have been going up with earnings even as rates and b/s been normalizing
1783 2018-06-09 15:07:14 Follow 4 stocks, know them inside out.  When they go down, buy.  When they go up, sell.  Repeat whenever you have time.  Never sell at a loss, just wait.  EZ game. These 4 stocks you should be willing to hold forever.

1822 2018-06-09 14:35:05 Military doesn’t have bump stocks. Never did. Bump stocks are a toy. Actually slow down fire. Every gun purchase is checked. Govt fails to update records or follow through. Next.

1864 2018-06-09 13:57:50 Volatility in the market after a smooth run exposes a lot of our behavioural shortcomings. We should make a note of them, introspect and work on them as investing is as much about behaviour and mental models as it is about picking right stocks.

1954 2018-06-09 12:22:37 If you Ban Bump Stocks the crime rate will still not go down one bit, you still have over millions and millions of illegal firearms on the streets that have not been found yet so you first have to fix that problem and then maybe gun control policy may work
1955 2018-06-09 12:21:31 Expecting stocks will arrived on Monday afternoon. If not, lets move the meet up schedule on Tuesday afternoon. I'll send PM to the owners of each item by Monday for updates. Thank you!

1969 2018-06-09 12:07:44 Stocks are collectibles: limited edition, ownership entitles holder to certain rights.

A security token is a variety of NFT collectible. 

Not arguing for kitties, simple use case. Agree about tokenizing real world assets. But power is unlocked by the right level of abstraction.

1974 2018-06-09 11:51:31 How's this then: We live in a country where our rights only extend to what doesn't conflict with the rights of others. The ability to own bump stocks or assault-style weapons, I believe, infringes on the rights of others to live, and to live beyond the tyranny of fear.
1975 2018-06-09 11:45:58 Part 5: Must be a CANSLIM stock. The best stocks to trade only! Why invest in shitty or unprofitable companies?

Think about it and let me know if this works for you.
1976 2018-06-09 11:45:25 So clearly the solution is to abandon #EU fishing quotas designed to stop us exhausting fish stocks and then just have a free-for-all until all edible sea life has disappeared. You couldn't make it up.
1977 2018-06-09 11:45:24 Part 3: When the crash comes BUY CANSLIM stocks while on sale. Focus on little to NO debt stocks because they are not effected by interest rates.

Stock must grow 30% minimum per year imo to be considered.

1982 2018-06-09 11:39:37 It's more true when correlations are only somewhat positive, instead of *strongly* positive. E.g. my utility stocks were up while my semi's were down. Not, my BCH was down more than my BTC, and let's not talk about my ERC20 tokens. 

It's more about scattershotting upside.

1990 2018-06-09 11:34:49 1 of 2: Bump stocks aren’t what most people think they are. They aren’t necessary to bump-fire a gun. I learned to do that when I was a kid using only my finger. They make the gun less easy to use. Most people only know about them because of Vegas where arguably its use saved

1992 2018-06-09 11:32:12 relatively new to stocks but it still amazes me how many grown adults act like teens. Theres so much more to life. And the thing is. I actually like swamis stuff when I first started but I soon realised the relentless aim at a certain stock was not really a experienced opinion

1994 2018-06-09 11:31:38 Ok thanks but how to find these stocks is their any way to check the list of stocks?
1995 2018-06-09 11:30:10 This is why Congress should tear down legislation that prevents class action products liability lawsuits against the NRA or weapons and accessory manufacturers for bump-stocks and suppressors. If MacDonald's Coffee is too hot, perhaps suppressors are more dangerous.
1996 2018-06-09 11:25:58 C'est ça ! Et puis le temps d'épuiser les stocks de formulaire, ça entretient la confusion chez certains.
1997 2018-06-09 11:25:50 In saying that... I know a lot of people have talked down Klaus and how they wont touch his shares now. Im sure most came to that same conclusion in any case. But I'd hope they wouldn't actively go out hunting those stocks to Down ramp.
1998 2018-06-09 11:24:13 Have you bought any stocks in Jamaica lately? Well it’s a good time to buy stocks there. Check out website for help.
1999 2018-06-09 11:24:09 I dont mind if you want to promote a certain stock as there are so many and it's often handy to be pointed in a direction to look into a company and make a decision. But I dont understand the need to act like a teenager trolling certain stocks because of a certain person.
2000 2018-06-09 11:24:03 Would this be the same Iran that the Obama administration and Clinton Foundation have just spent vast amounts of time, money, and US Uranium, to get their Uranium stocks up, and fix the extractors damaged by the Worm virus? Sensible.

2003 2018-06-09 11:17:50 Sometimes stocks that have performed well have reached a newsflow hiatus. OTOH those that have performed less well, may have an intrinsically sound business coming to the start of a newsflow cycle.

2005 2018-06-09 11:16:22 It doesn't take much to own stocks these days. All you need is five-hundred bucks and a bank account.
2006 2018-06-09 11:16:21 Stock markets do well when the government drops 10 trillion dollars into the banks. Borrow cheap intrest dollars and buy stocks. Win win but phony as heck. Booming economies are the last thing progressive democrats want. They want control and dependency.
2007 2018-06-09 11:14:19 At which time we should put them (Redwood, Farage, IDS, Gove, Lord Snooty, Johnson, Davis et all) in the stocks and throw dog sh*t at them.

2030 2018-06-09 10:31:08 The stocks are in ports as strategic planning for railways and railway cars was planned 2 years in advance.

2040 2018-06-09 10:18:46 ... That's not how stocks work. Brand value contribution doesn't collerate to absolute earnings but rather to reputability and market expectations.

Do you even know finance stuff at all?

2046 2018-06-09 10:12:24 @ChrisCaggs where do you see junior mining stocks on TSX Venture going in 2018?
2047 2018-06-09 10:11:54 I'm sure they deliberately pick ppl who aren't all that bright to interview tho'. The media like making laughing stocks out of people. It's cruel to make fun of people who are obviously not really capable of rational thinking.Poor guy,hasn't got a clue, but that's not his fault.
2048 2018-06-09 10:11:46 He couldn't do bump stocks right dude...
2049 2018-06-09 10:10:22 Finally bought it. would have given 5* for quality of your products. You are simply the best. But your flash sales are a shame really. You need to stop flash sales. India is a huge market and loves you a lot. Come with stocks, we are waiting to hug you big time, long time.
2050 2018-06-09 10:08:20 the owner of that gopchang place better double his stocks of food. i'm sure he'll sell a lot 
2051 2018-06-09 10:07:47 Doesn’t financial regulation come into play tho? If you’re selling a player, your finances increase that could affect your stocks. So if you buy Lyon shares now, they could go up by next week? Insider dealing comes into play imo.

2066 2018-06-09 09:37:12 How about his investment in Dish?  The stock is down 50% and their debt exceeds their stocks equity.  Earnings down 50% last q except with corporate tax cut earnings were flat.  Co losing subscribers. Shorts comments say stock is going to zero.
2067 2018-06-09 09:35:52 The more I understand these stocks the more I feel absolute about them. That gives me as much confidence as possible which makes me more than happy to add even if it means increasing my average. #C4XD #AERO I would like to have this belief about #INFA in the near future

2074 2018-06-09 09:30:11 It only makes you more respected and loved by your students. Lovely to see the stocks at school. A welcome addition to the behaviour policy perhaps. If you don't remember proper nouns....  Some might see it as a positive!! Either way it would be satisfying
2075 2018-06-09 09:28:00 @IIC_2018 @IIC_June18 @nooreshtech loved your idea: sectors by charts and stocks by balance sheet.

2077 2018-06-09 09:18:51 Thank you for this one, sir. I had a small list of stocks picked from the ones you had recommended. Even during all the recent sell off and violent moves, the list was more than 70% in green. Hats off to your wisdom and willingness to share that.
2078 2018-06-09 09:17:36 The only people who need suppressors are:
1. James Bond
2. Jason Bourne

Can you see a pattern?

What possible reason does a civilian need a suppressor? It's exactly the same point about semi-automatic rifles or bump stocks. People just don't need them. #NoRA
2079 2018-06-09 09:13:40 Tips for teachers: when joining in with a charity wet sponge/stocks event organised by students, remember they will also soak your trousers...this will avoid having to wear pe shorts with your shirt, tie & shoes all afternoon. #doh #emergencytrousersneeded

2086 2018-06-09 09:01:41 Before I found out about crypto less than a year ago, I used to spend about 2-3h each day on the stockmarket. Did it for years and years. 
Today: 12+h on crypto, 1 minute on stocks... 
2087 2018-06-09 09:01:16 Umm...more like, a trade deficit is often a sign of a strong economy. When consumers have confidence in jobs/economy they spend money on cheap imports. Trump hears “deficit” and assumes we’re losing bcuz he’s an idiot. That money gets put back in the US via bonds, stocks, etc...

2155 2018-06-09 07:00:18 Agreed. Find me a financial planner who recommends borrowing $ at 15% to invest in stocks? Yet that's precisely what The State Government is doing when it fails to inform auto-enrollees of the consequences IF "retirement saving" occurs at the expense of paying off a credit card.
2156 2018-06-09 06:59:59 If you wish your investments to grow, you must purchase investments whose cash flows trend upwards over time. Only stocks and income properties do that.

2159 2018-06-09 06:56:13 The more I think about this, the less bad of an idea it seems. Aesthetically it’s no worse than a Ruger RPR, but compared to the RPR, it’s probably cheaper & easier to produce, more aftermarket options for barrels, handguards, triggers, stocks, etc.

2180 2018-06-09 06:22:02 It’s no longer about the ‘right to bear arms’.  Now it’s a question of how to ‘get away with murder’. I’m positive there is no mention of silencers or bump-stocks in the constitution, but some of the American people continue to be brainwashed into thinking this is the norm.

2184 2018-06-09 06:18:40 So that is all you have to say the economy was rolling is gas prices? I paid more taxes under Obama. My 401K and stocks have grown under Trump’s economy. Our unemployment rate down and jobs created are more.

2200 2018-06-09 05:45:42 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to cure your insomnia
2201 2018-06-09 05:45:01 The automotive xenon headlight industry is a complete scam. Nobody stocks the replacement bulbs, dealers charge hundreds of dollars more and every online retailer has a website built in 2001 and is shady AF.
2202 2018-06-09 05:43:40 Out of the never-ending euphoria, we take a look at two mid-cap stocks that have grown doubled the money in just 6 months. Shares of the pharmaceutical firm Merck Ltd and business process management firm Firstsource Solutions have risen more than 100% in last six months only.

2204 2018-06-09 05:38:05 many would argue that new investors should avoid risky stocks. NTPC can offer 8-10% CAGR including dividend. downside risk is limited. btw sir can you give your views on Apollo Hospitals
2205 2018-06-09 05:35:57 The stock market is going to suck once trump destroys our economy.  It's already happening.  He is starting a trade war, and driving up insurance costs.  The next major recession, or depression - isn't far behind.  Stocks are going to take a nose dive.  Don't bother!!!!

2209 2018-06-09 05:34:01 nobody sd trust cnbc and other experts from tv..all promote stocks for their profit and that company's..u do study urself and just invest in good stocks..
2210 2018-06-09 05:31:33 What the stock market needs to do is to reevaluate the kind of attention they pay to stocks and the range of stock investments. America still believes you can become fabulously wealthy trading Frozen Concentrated Orange Juice. I think it's firmer than Facebook. Really I do.
2211 2018-06-09 05:30:10 In the corresponding time, many large-cap stocks have outperformed the key equity indices such as HUL, Bajaj Finance, M&M, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Tech Mahindra and TCS.
2212 2018-06-09 05:28:34 You know goddamn well if Dems take congress the gun control debate will be like "NO BUMP STOCKS, MIN AGE 21 for AR15's," and Repubs be like "Every child should be issued an AR15 at birth, bump stocks are traditional stocking gifts at Christmas, don't fuck with my religion"
2213 2018-06-09 05:26:26 Per law, clubs who have shares in stocks can't disclose transfer sales to media that include fees without first informing stock holders in the stock market. Liverpool don't have stocks in the market so it's a financial thing from Lyon

2223 2018-06-09 05:15:30 When the stock market crashes again I think it’d be very smart to buy lots of stocks. Eventually it’ll go back up.
2224 2018-06-09 05:13:03 Who knows about stocks? I got a nice amount of stock but not sure how to manage it.
2225 2018-06-09 05:12:07 #GE had a price spike for a minute and the company sold $58M in shares to raise capital in that price spike. I wonder if there was a price pomp so that they can sell their shares at a higher price! #dowjones #stockstowatch #stocks #daytrader

2235 2018-06-09 04:55:41 Ban bump stocks now.
2236 2018-06-09 04:55:40 @nalandacapital which stocks would you suggest for long term horizon looking at present valuation.worth the price
2237 2018-06-09 04:54:18 Yeah I know pimps wore tons of jewelry because they put basically all of their assets into it. It's fine if you just wanna set the money aside I suppose but it won't grow. It's much smarter to put it somewhere it can appreciate like realestate, stocks, or crypto.
2238 2018-06-09 04:50:57 Who do you think works in care homes? Who do you think stocks the shelves at the dollar store or Walmart? How much per hour do you think the cleaner in that office building is paid? Lots of people depend on jobs that are minimally paid. Look around you.
2239 2018-06-09 04:50:07 When it comes to stocks and shares. No matter how good or successful you think other people are? Never blindly follow someone else. 

Trust your own judgement and avoid rainbow chasing. Even some of the cleverest Twitter handles have rubbished ideas that have gone on to multibag.

2246 2018-06-09 04:42:23 Yea need to dd on those pot stocks
2247 2018-06-09 04:42:23 Do these idiots understand that stocks are all just fake shit? Do they know what a stock's face value is? Stocks etc are like artworks only worth something if you find some idiot to buy it.
2248 2018-06-09 04:42:20 It’s understandable though. But it’s the little things that count. It’s like stocks I could own a share of a company and the price goes up 5 cents...that’s only 5 cents. Now if I owned 100,000 shares that .05 cent increase made me $5000.

2261 2018-06-09 04:20:39 #TaxScamBill historically gives 1% biggest tax breaks leaving behind the workers who were instrumental in creating successful biz for them.

2269 2018-06-09 04:11:44 Why didn't you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
2270 2018-06-09 04:11:39 But if the Swiss National Bank keeps printing cash to buy FAANG stocks, sooner or later they'll own them all with no more effort required than point and click.

2274 2018-06-09 04:09:08 How to trade in stocks? Framework: 1. Mr. Market Circle. Find the local top and bottom. 2. Panic days and strong stocks.3. Sector stocks move together. 4. Trade sectors, not single stocks. 5. Sell when sectors reach the local top. 6. Keep focus on the decreasing sectors and wait.

2276 2018-06-09 04:09:01 Matt,

The BATF determined that bump-fire stocks did not make a firearm automatic.

As for raising the age, how would you reconcile members of the military, competitive shooters, Olympians, hunters, etc who are under 21?

2286 2018-06-09 04:00:31 I have a local surplus store that stocks most all old 74 series stuff, so I’m lucky there. Yeah, those MOS 7708 have such high failure rates (and they run hot for a small logic chip!) that I usually replace them outright on a machine I care about actually using.

2288 2018-06-09 03:51:55 More people are working earning wages that are taxed; a lot of offshore cash came home and paid 21% tax.  People sold stocks and real estate for a profit and paid tax.  With increased wages and bonuses some of us are having to pay more in quarterly payments to the treasury!
2289 2018-06-09 03:51:41 Is there a lesson that writers and readers would benefit from writing about less stocks? Maybe have a core focus group of 10-20 for each writer? Interesting thoughts on incentives and if the incentive structure is in reader's best interests.
2290 2018-06-09 03:50:32 AFTER the "but" he wrote the following, which, troll, by your logic is true, then:

2305 2018-06-09 03:32:25 I'm a gun owner and staunch #2A advocate and even I recognize that bump-stocks are just wrong. If the weapon semi-auto, let it be. But a semi-auto w/ a bump-stocks is just a full auto, which is prohibited and for good reason. You're a troll, dudebro.
2306 2018-06-09 03:31:05 Regardless of all these things isn’t it the perfect time to buy with full force sir. When shall market will provide this once in a lifetime offer to buy stocks with so much good risk to reward. Huge profits are made when investors sentiment are at its low. Just a thought.
2307 2018-06-09 03:31:04 Bump stocks pour into Chicago from all of the gun-clinging areas of "law abiding citizens".

2311 2018-06-09 03:24:06 it’s because their g.o is non profitable means they will just get the stocks on their supplier and lend it to their buyer

2317 2018-06-09 03:13:38 Real talk. Do you know why the NRA is terrified of restrictions on assault weapons? It has precisely shit to do with personal freedoms. It is about money. Specifically, the tactical (Picatinny) rail mounted accessories, scopes, extended mags, stocks and others to sell you.

2356 2018-06-09 02:31:15 Hes the reason we are not a "wealthy nation" guys like him took all the wealth and hold it at the top and use it to buy our law makers off! To pay for tax cuts for the already rich, to pay for wars, to rig elections & profit off insurance company stocks!

2366 2018-06-09 02:25:39 I can answer that. Obviously you know the president does not MAKE laws, the president RATIFIES laws made by the senate. If a bill is put on his desk to amend the constitution and make a law to ban bump stocks and change the legal age to purchase firearms, he would sign it. Simple

Ban on bump-stocks is actually less important...

Main problem is always people following these laws... otherwise this entire conversation is worthless!

2393 2018-06-09 01:51:21 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?

2406 2018-06-09 01:35:00 The gun show loophole is a myth. Which mental health problems? Not all mental health problems constitute being stripped of your rights or make you dangerous. Bump stocks should remain legal, they literally do nothing.

2411 2018-06-09 01:32:31 No law will stop every situation. So you are opposed to closing the gun show loophole? How about restricting people with mental health problems from having weapons? Bump stocks ok with you? The NRA opposes any laws.

2422 2018-06-09 01:24:15 This is a great chart. But when I see the drawdowns gold can have, and the current price levels of both stocks and bonds, one wonders if you should be 100% in cash and “pray” fiat currencies don’t suffer hyperinflation ?!

2424 2018-06-09 01:20:23 Gold miners always loosely followed the business/credit cycle. But that stopped after 2008. It just doesn't make sense for gold stocks to be this weak in a normal market. This price model isn't working. It's very bad for the mining business. But not for physical gold long term

2442 2018-06-09 01:00:50 Methinks this is one of your worst tweets ever. You contend the market is efficient and ‘correct’ 100% of the time? I don’t. Big bets on individual stocks are not a 50/50 gamble when you are right and sentiment is wrong.
2443 2018-06-09 01:00:38 Hey bro I will agree with you on this. I do not understand the need for businesses to give a 20 M salary to CEO’s. Not to mention millions in stocks. Same for other execs. Can easily take that money and better distribute it to employees. I find that ridiculous.

2448 2018-06-09 00:58:06 Most big things started off as uninteresting or “nothing new.”

When an entire generation is buying and selling all stocks and assets out of their Coinbase account, let me know how unimportant it is :)
2449 2018-06-09 00:56:36 I mean making real money by building companies.   Collectables and tokens will still be big for many people.  People can already make money buying and holding stocks whether they are tokenized or not.  Nothing new there.
2450 2018-06-09 00:51:56 It’s to bad that trump getting all the credit. When obama is the one that actually got unemployment numbers down and stocks up more that trump has brought them. And tax cuts have not shown any benefits for higher wagers or even real manufacturing jobs

2548 2018-06-08 23:36:25 Zuck bought the 5 houses around his own house and leave them empty just to protect his own privacy.  Yet idiots buy $FB stocks and push it to fresh new high. I guess the real idiots are those who still use this site. They must have such low self esteem. SMH.

2550 2018-06-08 23:35:19 Then why are you supporting reduced Marine Park areas & protections? Clean oceans without fish stocks are meaningless
2551 2018-06-08 23:34:37 I’m always just happy when street stocks come out after mods 
2552 2018-06-08 23:34:26 You're really obsessed with bump stocks aren't you? And raising the age does nothing. If they're a nut, they'll be a nut 3 years later!
2553 2018-06-08 23:34:23  U.S. stocks closed higher on Friday, with major indexes closing out their strongest week in months: • US  MARKET : - DOW JONES (25 316,53) 0.30% +75,12
 - NASDAQ  (7 645,51) 0.14% +10,44  - S&P 500 (2 779,03)
0.31% +8,66
2554 2018-06-08 23:30:21 >Or, translated: sell, or simply stay out, until stocks crash, then buy ahead of the next Fed easing/QE cycle.

2565 2018-06-08 23:23:04 Follow up to the poll. Credit cards charge 15 - 20 percent. Paying them off is a guaranteed high return. Stocks are a great investment. However, It’s smart to get rid of that high interest debt first.
2566 2018-06-08 23:22:38 Remember when intel stocks went down to $38 -$42 after the backdoor kernel problem google discovered in their last 10 gen processors? Yea? The stocks have only risen since then..

Donald #CommanderCheese : Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks & raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA? Must Stormy give you another #spanky?
2572 2018-06-08 23:15:41 @600espnelpaso WallStreet stick to stocks and bonds. LBJ to Boston would have to involve a multiteam player plus other incentive trade scenarios. Like a paid $20 mil contract for LbJ jr to sit on his bench immediately!
2573 2018-06-08 23:15:25 Don’t see how it’s a positive for foreign investors, unless their regulators have some teeth in actual policing these companies’ reporting standards, which is highly questionable. Otherwise, this is just going to bring competing speculation $$ of these stocks back home.
2574 2018-06-08 23:14:57 Haven't watched it in ages. Game changed from being a super competitive sport where players on both sides of the ball could win games to a one sided affair where offense players like receivers and QBs are assets and everyone else expendable.
2575 2018-06-08 23:14:35 Technical charting I did for stocks and option trading came really handy. Hold became #HODL, however it is the same concept. Besting the market became moon, etc..

2584 2018-06-08 23:07:13 Martini just called me. I didn't take out the stock market update MB did from 5/4. So please be aware: the numbers MB gave for the stock market were from 5/4. The disclaimer at the beginning of the segment should have conveyed that. Do not buy/sell stocks based on what MB says.

2591 2018-06-08 23:04:30 I’m glad you continued this thought. I was thinking the same shit. But it was stuff like stocks, uranium, Pacific islands. All ridiculous.
2592 2018-06-08 23:03:57 Looking up stocks is impossible. Binance spam has ruined it. Makes it impossible. I keep reporting it but Twitter can’t keep up.
2593 2018-06-08 23:00:48 I just started investing in stocks and crypto today and im already hooked.

2595 2018-06-08 22:58:58 2020. If you think that’s a long time for 10x 100x or 1000x you’ve never traded stocks or options or any other type of investment for that matter.
2596 2018-06-08 22:57:30 Digitalizing real world assets such as property and stocks will be the biggest.
2597 2018-06-08 22:56:23 Phillip. The sad thing is that you are a TRUE believer. The rank and file of the NRA would support sensible rules such as no bump stocks. Silly that you are that in the dark about fellow NRA folks.

2599 2018-06-08 22:54:10 Trump thinks he can tell his rich buddies to go buy stocks ahead of time. As always he favors the rich and thinks he is above the law.
2600 2018-06-08 22:53:53 Releasing tax returns, banning bump stocks, Mexico will pay for the wall, he’s a Christian, he respects the 1st amendment...everything he says is a lie.  Why would this one be any different?

2602 2018-06-08 22:52:56 Do tech stocks pay dividends to all shareholders, or are they still a last-one's-the-bagholder casino game?
2603 2018-06-08 22:46:09 Right? I thought paws being trapped in stocks and being brushed sounded pretty stupid
2604 2018-06-08 22:45:54 Thanks James! Sorry we couldn't get to this today. We'll make sure to ask our guests next week if they can talk about either of these stocks!

2606 2018-06-08 22:44:50 Does @SenatorEWarren remember why Obama passed the Stock Act? Because members of Congress used information they had to buy stocks because they were immune to insider trading laws!!
2607 2018-06-08 22:44:15 Sure wish #FedEx would support a rational gun policy that supports national registration for all sales, including trade shows, bars the sale of semi-automatic weapons, bump stocks, large ammo clips, keeping weapons out of the hands of the mentally ill, and terrorists.
2608 2018-06-08 22:43:35 One of my fav bio tech stocks in my portfolio right now.  great job excellent pipeline!
2609 2018-06-08 22:43:17 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses
2610 2018-06-08 22:41:24 Similar 2 the back half of 2000, where subsequent 2 the final rate hike, #Gold rallied a few weeks – before turning down w/stocks later. It was only after stocks were rejected in Aug below previous highs via Mar that Gold began to outperform ~Mkt. Anthropology
2611 2018-06-08 22:40:59 I love a good trade war.  Wish I owned the right stocks to get the same benefits you all will.
2612 2018-06-08 22:40:20 These are the 3 stocks in technology sector that yesterday set all-time highs:
$LPSN, $WIX, $SAP
2613 2018-06-08 22:38:25 August will be a strong month. Blockchain stocks will release financials. Can u see anything happening before then? I don't.
2614 2018-06-08 22:34:28 So according to this report salmon farms may have a role in the transmission of PRV to wild stocks but we don't know if the virus causes disease in Pacific salmon.

Do I have that right?

Either way continuing the science is a good idea.
2615 2018-06-08 22:32:13 WHO is that stellar analyst? What other stocks does he like?
2616 2018-06-08 22:31:36 From MS:  148 of the S&P 500 stocks having fallen more than 20% at some point since the market's P/E peak on December 18th. 

(Data as of June 4, 2018).
2617 2018-06-08 22:29:51 Stocks close higher for the 3rd week in a row. First time since January.
2618 2018-06-08 22:29:28 Oliver is not nearly as accomplished as a barking seal. He’s more of a cuckolded parrot. 

He trades in racism like Normals trade stocks. Tho he is not very competent at that either.

2620 2018-06-08 22:27:10 Ok a real reply

I rather not have ledgehogging in smash 5 but they need to tweak the mechanic 
In Melee/Brawl that was one of the ways to end an opponent stocks its one of the biggest reason those games are 4/3 stocks and smash4 is 2 stocks.
2621 2018-06-08 22:26:36 my 7-y/o nephew gets mad when he loses at smash and yells for us to change it to time instead of stocks and as cool and accommodating an uncle as i try to be i went through that phase and playing smash on time is where i draw the line
2622 2018-06-08 22:25:59 Can anyone prove to me or the rest of America where wages have been increased!? Cuz I can prove how stocks are being bought back instead but hey.. we all knew that was gonna happen anyway right!? #trumpBULLY #ImpeachTrump
2623 2018-06-08 22:25:55 @penguinrandom @jimcramer I am listening to audiobook of Get Rich Carefully and parts of the book don't apply to todays market:stocks, companies, executives, trends...How about issuing an update, like software companies do, to the audio book with new info for free or some fee.
2624 2018-06-08 22:25:52 The wise trader these days will plan to insure sub-prime stocks, not on an ad-hoc basis. And, importantly, on resolving short positions: Never forget:= in the derivatives marketplace, never ever diversify them.

2636 2018-06-08 22:17:36 Part 3. The study states that:
 1. ..answering the question of whether the virus [PRV] causing HSMI in Atlantic salmon causes disease in Pacific salmon is critical.

&

2. ..study is currently underway to assess the role of salmon farms in the transmission of PRV to wild stocks.
2637 2018-06-08 22:16:32 Think he'll be dancing like that when he's in jail? I can't fathom why these guys want to commit mass suicide, especially in the city here America was founded. He should be put in stocks naked on Liberty Square in the middle of winter.
2638 2018-06-08 22:14:49 Buy Kaheru stocks now my girl is going to the moon
2639 2018-06-08 22:13:48 Bought my first few stocks yesterday... checked them today and i lost $17 
@WarrenBuffett @wolfofwallst  help.
2640 2018-06-08 22:12:04 I’d say the less experience you have, the more volume you want. You need that liquidity. I’m comfortable in very illiquid stocks but that’s not for everyone.
2641 2018-06-08 22:10:31 First we would need to defined what “safe” mean! 

Bonds apart from index-linked offer no safety. Index-linked bonds would give an inflation linked return - the negative interest rate.

This does not make stocks safer. The real investment return for the next 30 years is unknown!
2642 2018-06-08 22:09:18 Hey, They are cannabis stocks, how about celebrating with some cannabis instead??
2643 2018-06-08 22:08:57 @theresa_may you don't think he's important enough to talk to. More fool you lady. Stick with the laughing stocks Trudeau and Macron  and you will be even less creditable when you get back. USA is our oldest ally and just because he talks straight doesn't mean you ignore him.
2644 2018-06-08 22:06:54 What we really need is David Cameron in the stocks! 
2645 2018-06-08 22:06:36 Bump stocks are already illegal to own & sell by federal law.
2646 2018-06-08 22:05:40 I learned how to properly make different stocks by reading his Les Halles cookbook and loved Kitchen Confidential. This is a sad day.

2648 2018-06-08 22:04:32 @jimcramer Jim do you think there is validity in the thought that we are in a tech bubble and that we are due for a correction? That tech is a defensive play against rising yields. Are there tangible risks to being long tech stocks.I happen to really like $APPL $AMZN $CRM& $RHT.

2652 2018-06-08 21:59:24 Bump stocks are not the issue. AR15s are not the issue. The issue is the mentality of Americans regarding guns, and their carelessness with guns.
2653 2018-06-08 21:58:38 In some emergency #writing #plot surgery, scrapped 30,000 words, put main character back in stocks and started lobbing even more wet sponges her way. I will re-finish this fucker.
2654 2018-06-08 21:58:37 I expect that stupid thing that put at the start of towie admitting it’s scripted and fake. Fair play to the people on there though, they’ve all signed with talent agencies and will make a fat stack off this. Maybe you should give up the stocks and get involved 
2655 2018-06-08 21:58:34 1% here as I trade stocks but began crypto trading Feb/Mar 2027 due to wanting to trade 24/7. Was going to learn Forex to do so, until crypto came into my life 
#TradingIsLife 

P.S. I still trade both for many reasons/different approaches & strategies.
2656 2018-06-08 21:57:35 Unemployment 9.7% when Obama came into office, down to 4.4% when he left, created 15 million new jobs. Stocks up 14.5%. Saved auto and banking industries. Ended recession. Gas $5 per gallon in 2008, down to $2.19 Janurary 2017, now $2.96. Clean air and clean energy. Not enough?
2657 2018-06-08 21:56:42 That's correct Irene Jie. That's why it's a win win if we only sold puts on stocks we really wanted to own for a long term. :-) Have a wonderful weekend.

2664 2018-06-08 21:48:06 So that $178B of economic output went towards share buybacks, enriching executives while wages stay stagnant and workers live paycheck to paycheck. Sorry babyboomers, I aint buying your stocks... $BTC is gonna even the playing filed and I’m gonna watch you drown

2667 2018-06-08 21:44:56 the value of stocks goes down and cheaper to buy. I know it's a dumb question but there's a lot of things that aren't clear to me with TFSA
2668 2018-06-08 21:43:22 Emerging markets may feel further pain as the U.S. dollar gains, and it would be prudent to go underweight the asset class.

2671 2018-06-08 21:41:30 MARKET CONSENSUS: A bull market which will last another ten thousand years.  Sure anyone who shorts it will be squeezed out but that’s only because they are retards who don’t understand the fact that central banks have abolished the business cycle and stocks will go up forever

2688 2018-06-08 21:31:46 At what point does it say "ban guns"? Learn how to read. Raising the age limit and banning bump stocks doesn't stop you from being able to buy guns. It simply makes you much more moral and smarter. But I guess intelligence isn't your strong suit.
2689 2018-06-08 21:30:25 World stocks ex US fall: US +.3%.; Europe -.2%. Growth outlook for US in 2018 solidly above 3%; Europe much slower & US should outpace much of world. Some danger that trade issues will chop growth. Still 2018 should be +.

2711 2018-06-08 21:13:09 Yeah. Distilled spirits stocks will be badly depleted just before nuclear Armageddon — worst case scenario: no booze to find in the rubble.
2712 2018-06-08 21:11:27 you're a $RLV newbie---it just hit bottom recently, what do you want  more from me? blocking you? you know those stocks that fundamentals are good but nothing happens? $RLV is one and you need to know how to trade  it---go out, have some drinks, sniff cocaine and make love!
2713 2018-06-08 21:10:59 I don't complain about the GOP in the house and senate...why would I?  It's like complaining to the guy who stocks the 7/11 about what products they carry.  I complain about the #mercers and the #kochs who employ them and give them marching orders.  #resist #fuckthegop
2714 2018-06-08 21:10:29 The bubble is in government bonds, not stocks. Bond market is many times larger than the global stock markets... capital mill likely move out of bonds and into cash/stocks/tangible assets. Another bullish factor for the DOW.
2715 2018-06-08 21:09:08 That's why I can't invest in stocks :)
2716 2018-06-08 21:08:33 That's exactly where I'm at now.. break even and put my money in something else.. been sitting with my paper loss since 2.40.. AHHHGGG!
2717 2018-06-08 21:08:18 This looks amazing. I remember the nazis got quite clever with regards to monetary policy. Used stocks of large companies as collateral for marks or something

2721 2018-06-08 21:05:14 By the way, the key to make real money in trading stocks is to get three things right at the same time:
Right time to entry - the proven set-up is there.
Right trade size - you have to be confident enough to lay down your stake!
Right time to exit - Hardest one.

2792 2018-06-08 20:25:39 This is the entire basis of investment, where someone gives their money to a company, & the company gives them a piece of paper that the company claims is worth money. When the company is doing well these "stocks" can be traded for other stocks or money.
But the money isn't real.
2793 2018-06-08 20:24:25 Guarantee you most of the stock winners are wall street insider darlings while everyone else gets screwed, certainly it's not the best financially performing stocks over the past three quarters. Look at AMAT this week just an example, complete fraud, and smart investing a joke.
2794 2018-06-08 20:23:24 @Stockabilities @CertifiedGreenAccount partly true. Going short is probably the best option with such kind of stocks :)
2795 2018-06-08 20:22:54 What kind of brokerage are you guys @Tdamericatrade.  I had an market order on several stocks today and it didn’t get fill for 1 or 2 minutes.  Those end up costing me $500.

2798 2018-06-08 20:21:35 though technically possible the belt or a 3d printed bump stocks much easier than replacing the ar-15s reciever with one that can select fire. still the points that you could do close to just as well with an ar-15 as with an m16 given enough mods or technique.

2800 2018-06-08 20:19:29 Stocks end mostly higher as shift to blue chips continues. Dow +75, +0.3% to 25,316. S&P +0.3% but Nasdaq just +0.1%

Breadth remains positive, another sign more stocks participating: Winners top losers 17 to 12 on NYSE, 15 to 14 Nasdaq

2802 2018-06-08 20:19:07 That's when stocks will get whacked. It's quid pro quo.  My working thesis is that all will be in bear trends until Fed reverses, which they've committed to not doing unless and until a "material adverse event" whatever TF that is.  And first tool is rates, then QE last.
2803 2018-06-08 20:15:40 It is and you don’t have to go through a broker you also can get updates I also watch my stocks on wall street journal but you do have to pay for that I just learned through there so I’m more comfortable with the business news
2804 2018-06-08 20:15:01 The narrative contained makes sense. Initial production increases for Iran after ceasing sanctions last time was merely Iran selling from stocks and not a ramp in capacity which remained restrained by years of lack of investment in infrastructure. This remains the picture today.

2806 2018-06-08 20:13:28 On a side note, if you’re looking to financial news sources to get info before investing you have already lost. Talking heads on TV do not have the home investor’s best interest in mind when reporting on stocks, currencies, commodities, or anything else.

2848 2018-06-08 19:44:37 In Astoria’s view, broad market cap weighted indices are dangerous as they provide little margin of safety, are concentrated in expensive tech stocks, and vulnerable to volatility shocks.  Astoria believes diversifying across multi-factor ETFs is the better risk reward.  #Factors
2849 2018-06-08 19:44:15 Stocks Roughly Flat After Early Move To The Downside - US Commentary - Nasdaq
2850 2018-06-08 19:43:41 US large cap stocks are unattractive at the index level.  SPX just finished a ‘blow off the top’ earnings season and the index could not sustain a meaningful rally.  That is concerning.  In Astoria’s view, tighter financial conditions have been a headwind for asset prices in '18.
2851 2018-06-08 19:43:14 In my view Burton Malkiel has a great discussion about EMH in his book (Random Walk Down Wall Street). Yes, there are anomalies but many of them come and go. Also, always easy in hindsight to say stocks was mispriced year 2000 or 2008 for an example, but difficult in real time.
2852 2018-06-08 19:42:30 yet another stock to your list of shame $W $MBLY $CC $HUBS $INGN. Someone should make an ETF to buy all the stocks you recommend shorting; you're the worst trader I've ever seen!
2853 2018-06-08 19:42:14 Investors need to realize that there is a direct linkage between volatility and liquidity and most portfolios aren’t properly diversified based on our findings. Financial conditions have tightened significantly in 18 and we believe this has been a headwind for US stocks.
2854 2018-06-08 19:41:13 Like he supported a ban on bump stocks?

2865 2018-06-08 19:31:06 There isnt an anti gun “lobby”. Lobby would imply that gun laws are a business. The NRA and goons like you are the lobbyist, and you fools LOVE mass shootings because your stocks fire through the roof when they happen.

2869 2018-06-08 19:29:13 Would like to think any qualified adviser would understand that. 

Similar in principle to not putting the future projected value of a DC in as today's value or understanding time value of money.

2871 2018-06-08 19:28:57 Seb, But lets think the opposite?  If UEC holds up through this 4.3 million share sell off over 2 months, as it doing, this means one thing! Actually all U3O8 URA sell off stocks gained nicely.  The "Hedge Funds" are buying the Sector.  They know.  The Sector will take off 7/2+.
2872 2018-06-08 19:28:45 Sounds good but as everyone who is invested sells as soon as they are out of a paper loss the SP will go down!

2892 2018-06-08 19:16:01 Why should bump stocks go either? They've only been used like one time in the commission of a crime, and it's very easy to bump-fire a gun without one. Even from the shoulder.
2893 2018-06-08 19:15:35 That just proves that banning bump stocks is a largely useless gesture. Bump firing is nothing new - people have been doing it for decades.

And you can thank gun control laws for creating the market for bump stocks.

2909 2018-06-08 19:04:19 This is true. I actually thinking playing calls is wise at the current price point. Even if not holding through data, I expect some kind of bump before it's released.

3057 2018-06-08 17:36:50 I’m right there with you! It’s a nice to be in a stock that I have zero worries with the company. It was the same for $CSBR for me. Sadly I sold to soon with them, but both stocks are easy picks.
3058 2018-06-08 17:36:47 The reason I say 1997 is because there was a massive increase in Internet stocks in the 100's of % - Followed by a 50% - 60% correction - that was the "Discovery" wave - over the next three years all the real Companies went up 100's of more %
3059 2018-06-08 17:36:16 Because unlike crypto in stocks, Commodities & currencies we can SHORT the market if we think it’s going to go down so we were objective in our judgement. Crypto is one sided lambo & Moon Business.

For every 2 success stories there are 8 failures hence need to be extra cautious

3167 2018-06-08 16:37:06 Oh because we can do so much with stocks in the real world, its a fkn chart and im a fkin long term investor, simple as that. When my coins are triple digit and top10 next year tell me how you sold half at 100%
3168 2018-06-08 16:36:32 lol y’all all put like 50/100 a week into a pot then all hit a stocks with multiple investments that way the outcome is greater with a lower risk
3169 2018-06-08 16:36:12 Par contre dans les stocks comment il fait chaud omd
3170 2018-06-08 16:35:50 Racist 'GRump ought to get hell outa Canada. He isn't welcome. Racist idnoramous riffraff isn't worth 10 cents of security.

3177 2018-06-08 16:29:15 Foolfest 2018 was my first & it was great, so much fun  My GKC score is 1.985  Does that mean I own too many stocks?

3180 2018-06-08 16:27:09 I love how everyone thinks you@need to be perfect with your calls. As you mentioned we are up in JWN and a hole slew of other stocks in the portfolio. Power of diversification too! Keep your head up Jim.
3181 2018-06-08 16:26:48 Hi Andy. Our promotional offers are subject to availability while stocks last, and stocks can vary between stores. Our store staff will be best placed to let you know which products they have available. Apologies for any disappointment caused on this occasion.
3182 2018-06-08 16:26:23 Where I could be wrong is time. Low beta stocks might generally represent compounders which are not expected to put up great growth in any given year but might be good long-term potential winners. High beta stock investors may be fishing for quick kills.
3183 2018-06-08 16:26:02 KVD stocks are gonna take a huge hit bc apparently putting your child and all others at risk is your choice. Lmao. Wrong.
3184 2018-06-08 16:25:43 The struggle is real my friend. It's so easy to get pulled into the latest shiny object rocketing to the moon. I am working on focusing more intently on the stocks I originally had plans for.

3191 2018-06-08 16:19:54 I would actually say here that over-powerful stocks potentially push it in the direction of being a mini-game about stock ownership, rather than interacting deeply with what's going on elsewhere.

3205 2018-06-08 16:15:13 One good reason to have a stronger tie break mechanism for the stocks in TtR Penn is that it’s in an expansion and not in the core game, and because of this stocks needed to be important enough to change the way people play. With a strong tie break they are more significant
3206 2018-06-08 16:15:07 Need to understand...every time many experts screams about fertilizer stocks wrt mansoon....mansoon timing period well known...if everything and everyone so certain...y stocks loose 50% to 80% just before mansoon.....

3207 2018-06-08 16:15:03 Stocks can climb much higher than you can imagine, and drop much lower than you think possible.  Manage the risk and limit your losses, and let your winners run as far as they can go.
3208 2018-06-08 16:14:05 Corporations have not increased wages because they always reward their shareholders first...always buy back stocks first...
3209 2018-06-08 16:14:05 @scottwapner @pattidomm What is it with your pro-shorst bias - you put up a banner "stocks under pressure" with DOW UP and S&P and NASDAQ flat. You even lie to s try to push market down

3211 2018-06-08 16:13:44 Mr Soros invests in gold. If the stock market shows signs of static, stocks drop but the price of gold rises. Soros tried to create chaos in governments by hiring Antifa & BLM to bring violent protests against traditional institutions. He is banned in Hungary,Macedonia & soon EU.

3215 2018-06-08 16:13:13 Lets talk about that, but let's be honest. Bump stocks are owned by several gun owners, and have only been in one mass shooting. One that has been questionable from the start, but that's just fake news right? There is no gun show loophole, as even at gun shows ubc's are required.

3232 2018-06-08 16:09:32 All is well and thank you kindly for asking as I wish you well.  Yes, this extended in the cycle & valuations being what they are, scalps/swings are a way of managing risks imo. If done w/right stocks that you know well, very much adds up over the course of the year. Be well!

3243 2018-06-08 16:07:09 You can have a few winners, yes, but with enough coin flips, you probably don’t have a huge number of big losers. I don’t see how we can have it both ways: stocks are efficiently priced, but most investors are inefficient price setters. Not sure how that math would work.

3390 2018-06-08 15:05:32 The key to making big returns in stocks is not to trade every stock or catch the high or the low. It's about selling higher than you bought and doing it as many times as you can without taking excessive risk.
3391 2018-06-08 15:04:58 It is, no doubt about it. 

But you still need more than one income stream. 

And you need to be able to save a lot more than 10%(more like 30-40 of gross).

And you need to invest in something other than the stocks. Or, at least, don’t rely solely on stocks for your retirement.

What software do you use to research stocks. 

Love the article
3428 2018-06-08 14:45:21 Congress, through love of lobbyist money, allowed Monsanto to contaminate food & grain stocks w/toxins spliced into genes. Countries free from lobbyists banned use/import of altered (GMO) grains. Unfair trade policies don’t hurt US farmers, but Congress at Monsanto’s trough does.

3438 2018-06-08 14:42:06 As an example, during Brexit, a portfolio of 50% U.S. stock / 50% QLTY had a max drawdown of 5.17% compared to a 4.64% drawdown for 50% stocks 50% intermediate U.S. Treasuries. I have a strong feeling though that treasuries would have outperformed in the worst of 2009.

3453 2018-06-08 14:36:00 (2/2) You can't just say "Well, P/Es were X then and they're a lower Y now, so there's no bubble." It's about asset values vs. the economy, asset values vs. income, wildly risky behavior in credit markets, massive concentration of gains in fewer and fewer stocks, etc.
3454 2018-06-08 14:35:55 If all you were doing was investing in index funds that may be true. The one problem with index funds is you are invested in the dogs as well as the good stocks. I still like Asset Allocation and periodic rebalancing. And don’t forget Corporate Bonds and mutual funds.

My hypothesis is plain vanilla value works when there are stocks severely underpriced, but once those disappear (more likely with improved information / real $$ in quant) need to digest fundamentals too.

3687 2018-06-08 12:48:25 I support banning bump stocks
3688 2018-06-08 12:44:16 Still believe that the cloud stocks will soon recover. I think of stocks like $COUP, $NTNX, $CSOD ... but others can take longer to recover from this bearish momentum.
3689 2018-06-08 12:43:52 Marijuana is legal! Ford is in!!  Are pot stocks going to flyyy?
3690 2018-06-08 12:42:02 Hello what is ADBP? I scan weekly stocks for you to add to your watchlist if any stock has nice starting uptrending which is most important. In book book doesn't explain about scans. It is personal scan.
3691 2018-06-08 12:41:37 Yes stocks is guaranteed~
3692 2018-06-08 12:41:35 Apparently they're doing that so that their stocks don't fall before the stock market closes for the weekend. They did it with Lacazette too. People are also saying that Lyon meant it's just "information" about the transfer that's false. Like the transfer fee and all. Wordplay :P
3693 2018-06-08 12:41:35 Good Morning, futures slowly working their way back to r/g. Similar watches as yesterday $HEAR $IQ $HUYA $AXON $EDAP $DPW. Also watching weed stocks again this morning $CANN $BUDZ $CRON $POTN. Remember today is Friday so expect a bit more volatility especially end of day.
3694 2018-06-08 12:40:50 How was your trading week? I’m always thankful and optimistic that I can trade everyday but if I’m making key mistakes on days I should be capitalizing and making bank, I take a ste back (day off) because there will always be the same opportunity again! #stocks #daytrading #trade
3695 2018-06-08 12:40:17 Jobs are being added at a slower pace than they have in years. Stocks are propped up with buybacks from tax cuts, not actual profits. Illegal border crossings are higher than they’ve been in years. Trump is fighting w our allies and is friends w our enemies. Is that winning?
3696 2018-06-08 12:39:31 the abusive kind that leaves his kids with cigar burns
3697 2018-06-08 12:39:28 I told Lance if we didn’t have a sell discipline and provided falsehoods like stocks go higher 80 percent of the time we’d be managing 800 mil instead of 400.
3698 2018-06-08 12:38:25 Can @CDJapan please update their stocks so I can order both rnr and b-pass? 
3699 2018-06-08 12:38:15 Ban bump stocks now!!! Teachers need to be respected and higher pay.  Teachers are not gangsters  Thx you David for all you do 
3700 2018-06-08 12:37:59 The Company's stockholders approved an authorization to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary, to solicit additional proxies if there were not sufficient votes in favor of Proposal 1.
3701 2018-06-08 12:37:38 I wonder if Andrew Lo at MIT gets such slack when he suggests liquidate stocks during times of higher volatility in his Adaptive Market Hypothesis? Yep Mike you’re in the dirty side of the narrative that gets swept under rug.
3702 2018-06-08 12:36:22 When u mean Radical Control, R u referring 2Weapons & Bump stocks that r designed to maim & kill by spitting out hundreds of bullets per minutes? What is radical about that? It sounds sensible to me.  We aren’t living in a 3rd world country or in civil war torn places 2 need one.
3703 2018-06-08 12:35:18 I look at the stocks.
3704 2018-06-08 12:35:17 You can trade your plan perfectly 4/5 times in a day but that one time where you break all your rules can fuck you up mentally and financially for the rest of your day #stocks #daytrading #stubborness $AXON
3705 2018-06-08 12:34:52 @Super1NYC @EastcoastSecurities wtf is DPW New Yorker? lol kidding, I’m sure I’ll see it on finviz some day. Me, I only look at stocks $15+
3706 2018-06-08 12:34:42 Unfortunately the electoral commission website stipulates the public can be lied to by those seeking votes and it's the public's job to work out the reality.

3710 2018-06-08 12:33:25 $HMNY when do they delist stocks? I thought under $1?
3711 2018-06-08 12:32:58 You missed the point. I was replying to someone using that argument to support bump stocks.
3712 2018-06-08 12:32:51 both of those things help but a global stocks sitting near record doesn't help either for wheat; beans stocks are safe look at spreads. Corn, yes
3713 2018-06-08 12:32:45 By the time that little girl is 10 the Patriots will be the laughing stocks of the NFL and The Browns will be the dominant team 
3714 2018-06-08 12:32:12 #plasticpollution #PlasticBan is way for asking bribe by police from small shop keepers for sale of remaining stocks. Same is carried out by #gujaratpolice . On the caption of #plasticfree they r forcing to bribe them. @PMOIndia @CMOGuj take action
3715 2018-06-08 12:31:51 Can't wait to see if Torstar corp stocks tank at opening bell today!
3716 2018-06-08 12:31:25 @GetUpESPN I agree with Greenberg, players should be penalized to disincentivize moving. Say, make them carry a ball and chains, hire bounty hunters to drag them back to former team or just put them in stocks for public scorn and ridicule. #Capitalism
3717 2018-06-08 12:30:35 Kick this off today with a list, Lol:
$BYOC $LDSI $AMMX $DLYT - longs
$UCRP $LRDR - custodian plays
$EQLB $BFCH $LIBE- swings
$SBES - gone hogg'n
$GPNE $MKSEF $PRED - potential growth stocks down the road
$NTLK - will come around again, too good not to run
3718 2018-06-08 12:28:10 We love you @GreenacreBaz don't worry!
3719 2018-06-08 12:28:07 Only way to make some money in these eternal waiting stocks is trading in between whenever some opportunity comes and in fact keep coming.
3720 2018-06-08 12:27:30 Je suis du genre à être créative dans la limite des stocks disponibles.
3721 2018-06-08 12:27:05 Today is the start of my investment career, stocks have been purchased  #youngtrader
3722 2018-06-08 12:26:45 I hv doin this since last 10 months . .. but even then my portfolio is down by 16%....all my stocks r down below my buying rates... I averged few ... But still suffering losses
3723 2018-06-08 12:26:31 9-5 jobs literally change you. Never really liked coffee but now I drink it everyday, beginning to embrace the 9 pm bedtime and frequently engage in conversations about stocks and sports. 

My office literally calls me Fred or Ted (because there’s already an Ed in the office)
3724 2018-06-08 12:26:30 I would guess a Tory Leadership Challenge would cause £ to tank and perhaps Stocks would drop as well initially but then recover.
3725 2018-06-08 12:24:25 Won't the stocks fold over into Bayer?
3726 2018-06-08 12:23:38 Naturally, there seems to be continuous slow movement

But if the  stocks take a dump today - curious if crypto dumps too
3727 2018-06-08 12:23:05 To be honest Nicola I’m not quite sure if there is any pensions that aren’t linked to the stock market in some way? The trustees want them to grow and stocks and fund managed accounts are usually the best place for it for long term investment.
3728 2018-06-08 12:22:55 G7 is kicking off with more Donald Trump threats on trade, queuing up a whirlwind 24 hours of talks between allies before the U.S. president leaves early

3735 2018-06-08 12:15:05 Recently, mentioned cautious stock market since VIX had fallen near 12. Not surprised correction in stock market and too many stocks climbing higher for no good reason...
3736 2018-06-08 12:15:03 The worse part is that we have the proof the #TaxBreaks don’t trickle down to employees. $1.5Trillion will be spent on buying back stocks in USA. How that will help workers but when you #conservative #Republican Voters that’s the level of intelligence I will assume from them.
3737 2018-06-08 12:14:47 The small window I spoke of caused depredation in many stocks which traders r seeing now but MUCH will remain hidden for the next few days.BEWARE.
3738 2018-06-08 12:14:27 Thanks. Will you miss the voyagers if the new franchise gives new rolling stocks. I guess voyagers needs replacing.

3740 2018-06-08 12:11:26 Laura, Buffet should stick with stocks because his investment in Hillary was abysmal failure.

3744 2018-06-08 12:08:15 Your right to a high capacity magazine?

Your right to regular magazines without rate limiters/slow loading tab?

Your right to own bump stocks?

Your right to not be subjected to a voluntary, yes voluntary, buyback program for assault weapons, including semiautomatic rifles?
3745 2018-06-08 12:08:09 Everybody a kill up themselves about getting an iPhone and iPhone order less parts for the manufacture of the new iPhone while dem stocks a drop by 2% and Microsoft own a increase by 10%.

3749 2018-06-08 12:07:54 I certainly hope you do not have any retirement fund or stocks that have increased in value. I hope you won’t take advantage of any decrease in taxes next year. Surely you wouldn’t want any increase in pay or any bonus from an employer. I’m sure you don’t have anyone in military.

Horse track version of shorting stocks....
3755 2018-06-08 12:03:00 Bottom line: Hard to model hard dates because...
 1) we don‘t know when the long bull cycle (started in Q2 2009 for US stocks!) will end 
2) if $TSLA will turn around and raise capital - maybe on unfavorable terms or in novel ways (in case undisclosed issues make raising $ hard).
3756 2018-06-08 12:02:11 I really forgot I invested in stocks back in Feb  I should see how those are going

3758 2018-06-08 11:59:52 If you actually knew the truth, NRA has asked BATFE to re-evaluate their previous ruling that “bump stocks” were a legal accessory.  NRAs official stance is not FOR bump stocks.  Get your facts straight.  FACT: it was NRA that lobbied to pass NICS and now lobbying for FIX NICS.
3759 2018-06-08 11:58:51 If banning bump stocks isn't going to do anything, why is banning them a problem?
3760 2018-06-08 11:58:45 Ban bump stocks

3762 2018-06-08 11:58:25 I've never understood the "there's more indexes than stocks" argument. So what? There have been way more mutual funds than stocks for many years now but no one uses that to talk bad about MFs.

3780 2018-06-08 11:47:26 And this just shows how dumb you are he said ban bump stocks and make it more difficult to get a gun and you heard. Take away all the guns. Guns are super easy to get and that hasnt stopped shootings yet in fact the waffle house hero was unarmed.

3802 2018-06-08 11:36:03 This is stupid in so many ways. The baker owns his own business, self employed. When you work for a business you agree to follow it's policy, not your own.  Why would you work at a store that stocks condoms/ham/etc if you were that against them? People can just shop elswhere.

3808 2018-06-08 11:34:29 I take it you are aware that under FTA the EU are dumping excess food generated by the CAP at subsidised pricing in to ecowas countries putting their farmers out of business whilst CFP has devastated African fishing villages where the fleets plunder their stocks?

3822 2018-06-08 11:16:01 Then when the markets hit those record lows a couple months ago you all said it was Obamas fake money even though it was over a year later... Then when the stocks rose it was because of donald.

Stop enabling this man.

3838 2018-06-08 11:03:50 This is an inaccurate statement. I won't go into why because you don't actually care. Just want others who see this to google it if they want to know the issue surrounding bump stocks - attorney general and Congress could fix..it's regulatory but too busy working on racist agenda

3843 2018-06-08 10:57:48 It good for such things to happen so that @DrAlfredMutua can stop taking Machakos residents' for granted and lying to them. @Wavinya_Ndeti , enjoy your victory while stocks last. Its very hard to oust a sitting GVN. "Wiper's Wavinya Ndeti" "Machakos Governor" @ahmednasirlaw
3844 2018-06-08 10:57:47 I can still feel the shaking of the Apaches and the F13 raptors flying overhead. I almost didn’t know what to do, but then my group of radical republican and NRA came with their assault rifles and scary bumps stocks!!!
3845 2018-06-08 10:56:57 Didn't Obama approve bump stocks ? If Im not mistaken. Too early for me , you look.
3846 2018-06-08 10:56:30 Ah yes, I forgot how they wrote the right to bump stocks at any age into the 2nd. Those forefathers were so forward thinking. 
3847 2018-06-08 10:55:10 I was thinking of the same thing before u said it was sold out  but are u sure? Maybe there are some stocks left in diff branches???? :(
3848 2018-06-08 10:54:29 No Lyon won't want it lagging from this point from a financial viewpoint - their stocks apparently could suffer. They made a similar announcement just before Lacazette was sold. I am more anxious about the medical going awry tbh...
3849 2018-06-08 10:54:10 Or forever live off your parents who "make money" by owning stocks in companies like amazon. It's messed up when it pays more to own stock than to actually work.
3850 2018-06-08 10:54:08 Yeah usually reliable but there's always an element of doubt until it comes from the official channels (Paul Joyce). I think this is just a finance ploy to keep Lyons stocks steady. I maybe wrong
3851 2018-06-08 10:52:52 SO Myer stocks Tonymoly now and I had no idea but there's a sale on a lot of the items and I have to recommend getting the lip scrub if you need one because DANG MY LIPS HAVE NEVER BEEN SMOOTHER
3852 2018-06-08 10:51:52 2 questions. 

1. Who says investing in the stock market means individual stocks? 

2. What if you discovered that you having control actually decreased your returns instead of increasing them?
3853 2018-06-08 10:50:34 Please ban bump stocks.

3856 2018-06-08 10:48:43 I’ve read that some people that have been in marijuana stocks from the early days are starting to leave. Maybe this is the beginning of the end of the popularity stock market, and we start seeing companies with good fundamentals take off. I believe $PKG ParcelPal is undervalued.
3857 2018-06-08 10:48:43 This seems to make sense. Why wouldn't the same thing be true for stocks?

3861 2018-06-08 10:43:54 Looks like it violates federal law to me. Kinda settles the conversion issue. Bump stocks are an automatic conversion.
3862 2018-06-08 10:40:49 Obama legalised those bump stocks..you gonna criticise Obama?
3863 2018-06-08 10:40:03 Lyon stocks to crash if they confirm it. They don't want that until everything happens

3867 2018-06-08 10:35:34 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks like you said you would? Are you afraid of the NRA?

Flint still doesn’t have clean water.
3868 2018-06-08 10:35:14 Why doesn't someone ask of these 'pull up the anchor and sail off' morons to tell us how long the stocks of food, clothing, fuel, energy etc. will last us on our mystery cruise?  These types are absolutely clueless about international trade.  I feel so Brexit-depressed sometimes.

3871 2018-06-08 10:31:39 Yeah it’s just their president doing the same thing he did with you and Lacazette. They have to say a deal isn’t done due to stocks etc
3872 2018-06-08 10:31:01 Stocks? Lol. I think you’re giving Tailosive too much credit. I thought I had no right to talk about this and I should shut my mouth... I don’t think he’d be interested in showing me around,
3873 2018-06-08 10:30:15 Don’t get me wrong, I’ve been blessed. Trading stocks for 11 years seems to be taking off really well and I have enough money to live a decent life. I  have a wonderful family and enjoy the company of my mom and my aunt who are  still healthy and well. So why is life complicated?

Maybe sit today out.

3939 2018-06-08 09:40:07 The trouble with Dr. Feelgood method of stockpicking is that people invariably feel good after the market gains 600 points and stocks are overvalued and worse after it drops 600 points & bargains abound. The best way is to buy stocks regularly regardless of markets

3953 2018-06-08 09:24:35 I would not spend too much time on HY. Equities reinvest part of their profits which will lead to a growing dividend. Growth + higher starting yield is superior investment. 

In addition average quality of stocks is better than HY bonds.

3981 2018-06-08 08:57:37 Makes sense. We differ in that you're investing in stocks, whereas all of my trades are FX and Index trades. I have always day traded, but been looking to take more swing/longer term positions lately as we appear to be moving out of consolidation phases (he hopes!)

4315 2018-06-08 04:16:57 getting some bad flashbacks to my first retail job and having to sit through videos about how the work we do is doing so much for the value of our company's stocks as though it affects us in any way besides "the company itself isn't tanking so your job is also secure? probably??"
4316 2018-06-08 04:15:57 Still vakrangee is 5x book value, while PC at 1.6. Small retail generally dont buy stocks where clear value exists like leel electricals which is available at 0.6xBookvalue. It sold its part business to Havells @ 1550cr, while leel is trading at now 560cr.

4318 2018-06-08 04:13:20 I don't understand why anyone needs bump stocks
4319 2018-06-08 04:12:18 I don't get it. $ntap has flat/slightly decreasing revenues, flat profit margins propped up by maintenance contracts, is barely spending any $$ in R&D (14%) and it's clear the SolidFire acquisition did little to help revenues. No way the stock is worth $70+. #stocks #trading

4385 2018-06-08 03:24:21 Yes that’s what I was saying I concur with you.. it’s all the domestic money coming in and people buying dumb stocks. And here we go. Even a company like Apple is trading at teens. Why should we pay 125 PE to some companies in India even thought there is growth.

4438 2018-06-08 02:55:40 And of course the information in this tweet and article distorted the truth with purposely misconstrued headings. Additionally, the budget was passed with a Republican majority. Keeping it honest,  members on both sides of the aisle have pharmaceutical stocks in their portfolios.

4444 2018-06-08 02:53:12 What happened to other 20 % or so stocks what about those who invested in the 9% which are still left in micro cap. Also if you invested in 2008 you have to have a real bad luck or judgement to not make multibagger on any of the stocks you picked.

4468 2018-06-08 02:43:52 It's tricky. Word is Rupert wants Disney to buy Fox, cause the stock he gets eventually goes to his sons. If the stocks rises then possibly his sons will own majority of Disney. But if other Fox shareholdes unite they override his shares in Fox & he'd be forced to sell to Comcast

4485 2018-06-08 02:35:33 week b4 last stocks gapping up 30% or more would have a small to no spike then fade off all day, last week stocks gapping up the same % would spike up to half/whole dollar then fade to nothing, this week same gap up % spikes up big holds spikes again consolidates then fades off..

4487 2018-06-08 02:34:10 Hey Toni, I was curious if there was a sector in the market such as, commodities, tech, or utilities that's in its optimal trading stage/ cycle. Or do you trade leading stocks in  different sectors, as long as they meet technical prerequisites. Thanks in advance.

4491 2018-06-08 02:31:08 Yet no one has turned in their bump stocks with the NJ bumpstock ban
4492 2018-06-08 02:30:26 Everyone is silent during carnage...when motst stocks recover..so called experts make a beeline to give gyaan
4493 2018-06-08 02:29:53 If you believe the FBI then you would realize that bump stocks actually saved lives. ALL of the AR15's in Las Vegas that had bump stocks installed on them we're jammed. When used incorrectly the receiver heats up and expands and jams the rifle. No reason  to ban bumpstocks.
4494 2018-06-08 02:29:16 That is so unprofessional. Idk why no one has called them out about that. There gonna shoot themselves in the foot with all the online retailers that wanted stocks of the game to sell on there sites there going to make it hard for retailers to trust them in the future
4495 2018-06-08 02:29:02 There are 2 stocks right now I am keeping a watch on.

Both stocks are consolidating from long time and had remained resilient even in volatile markets

One is #retail sector major which I had recommended earlier as well 

And another is from Private #Banking Sector

4501 2018-06-08 02:22:12 he has been lucky too the stocks that typically fade to nothing lately been squeezing everyone out, but late day fades have been there on a few of them we need some more trades like $SLS and $RKDA nice gap and crap to nothing lmao
4502 2018-06-08 02:20:59 Canada legalized pot tonight - pot stocks set to soar in Am - so hopefully Caps win so I can celebrate twice - not a smoker but invested in it lol
4503 2018-06-08 02:20:55 Trump is tweeting about trade again, glad I sold my stocks today. Will most likely fall!
4504 2018-06-08 02:20:42 So...for all those incredibly bullish pot stocks because C45 passed...did anyone of you actually think it wouldn't? I mean, the result was pretty obvious. Interesting to see what the market does.
4505 2018-06-08 02:20:41 Because bump-stocks suck and anybody with a shop can make an ak into an automatic.

4509 2018-06-08 02:18:47 Traditionally, that makes them an underperformer, no? IPO stocks in Shanghai used to jump on average by 100 per cent on debut.

4511 2018-06-08 02:17:45 Who cares? Bump stocks are garbage and severely reduce any type of accuracy; obviously you don’t know squat about firearms so why not keep it shut and stop making yourself look foolish?

4536 2018-06-08 01:58:00 I not only think bump stocks should be banned, I think AR-15's and high capacity magazines need to be outlawed. There's absolutely no reason anyone needs an assault style weapon, let alone a fully auto one.

4575 2018-06-08 01:33:27 Ban bump stocks now. Ban assault weapons now. Universal background checks for ALL gun sales. Raise the age for gun purchases to 21. #BanBumpStocks #DemForce.
4576 2018-06-08 01:32:00 Beginning to think about bonds, stocks and investing in your employer’s provided retirement plan are key to making smart investments.
4577 2018-06-08 01:30:30 European stocks fell on Thursday as luxury shares declined and the euro strengthened as European Central Bank officials indicated they would start talking about exiting the central bank’s massive bond-buying program.

4581 2018-06-08 01:29:25 It doesn't matter if they are greedy, if you buy their stocks, if they succeed, you succeed. And everybody is greedy. It's how we get most of our innovations. Everybody is greedy.
4582 2018-06-08 01:29:16 US stocks ended the day mixed on Thursday, as falls in major technology shares put pressure on the benchmark indices.
Total consumer credit increased US$9.3 billion in April (market US$14 billion) after an upwardly revised US$12.3 billion gain in the previous month.
4583 2018-06-08 01:28:53 Having $20,000 in stocks just building on itself at 22 sounds nice.
4584 2018-06-08 01:28:37 You've gone down the wrong route. You're thinking of buying individual stocks -- a mistake. Focus on low-cost index funds.
4585 2018-06-08 01:28:31 I'll be fine and Bill C-45 passed in spite of all the conservatives who tried to mess that up. Weed stocks will keep the country on the up and up! 

Plenty to look forward to as humorists, Doug Ford as leader will offer up lots of material!
4586 2018-06-08 01:27:29 Not if you're not used to that amount of income like that. They don't receive the proper education on finances, credit, investments, stocks, bonds, etc. Owners don't care to invest in their players enough to give them that. It stems from racial hierarchy.
4587 2018-06-08 01:26:42 Any my followers into stocks?  I wanna enter that lane
4588 2018-06-08 01:26:06 Ban bump stocks. For what reason do we need to make semi-automatic weapons act like a fully automatic, but to kill other people. I like millions of other Americans can survive without them.
4589 2018-06-08 01:25:48 The AR-15 is a weapon of war on school children in America today. It’s fortunate that the AR-15’s were not tricked out with Bump Stocks like they were in Las Vegas, killing 58 and wounding hundreds in 11 minutes at a concert.
4590 2018-06-08 01:25:22 You missed some. Earlier this year, we saw the crypto-currency bubble implode, along with the pot stocks in Canada. Those were minnows. Lately we have started to see some good-sized: Turkey, Argentina, Petrobras (this one came as a surprise) and, of course, Italy.

4594 2018-06-08 01:21:45 Why haven’t you banned bump stocks? Are you afraid of the NRA?
4595 2018-06-08 01:21:39 @dennismccain @watdatstockdo i would just simply ignore these two stocks altogether.
4596 2018-06-08 01:21:32 I agree with you 100%. I don’t buy into spreading falsehoods or using position in media to talk down ( or up ) stocks. It’s wrong and often hurts a lot of people.I use indicators I developed when trading. I earn my money the old fashioned way- by doing my homework & hard work

4601 2018-06-08 01:17:18 That I agree with. Now, how about guns that "kill fast" like semi-automatic (especially those that can go fully automatic with bump stocks)? Personally, I'd want to restrict those strongly rather than to ban them, but some people are in favor of a ban. What's your take?

4606 2018-06-08 01:10:16 Please ban bump stocks. We need a starting point. It's called gun control for a reason.

4613 2018-06-08 01:02:11 Good question. 
I'm interpreting it to indicate the SPY is leading those NYSE stocks.
So, If the SPY loses interest then the NYSE will follow.

4618 2018-06-08 00:57:43 I don't  see "the left" fighting for anything specific. I see "the left" discussing what exactly should be in our gun restriction laws. The most frequently agreed on include bump stocks & high-capacity mags, better background checks, a registry, etc. Ban? I'd rather restrict.
4619 2018-06-08 00:57:21 Stocks have stagnated after months of growth, growth that was a direct result of trust in his tax reform-some growth wouldve maintained without reform.

4624 2018-06-08 00:53:38 It’s ridiculous isn’t it. He gets set at 1c takes it to 30c and gets ridiculed for selling. The lesson is clearly to get set where the pros get set - not after stocks have bagged onto top of bags.
4625 2018-06-08 00:52:27 Small cap mutual funds -- never individual stocks, unless you REALLY know what you're doing. Scary in bear markets, but you make up for it the rest of the time.

Well, other people do. I just do the accounting on the money.

4628 2018-06-08 00:49:09 Read my comments more closely...That bull market in Gold began around the time the stock market was in the early stages of a bear market. Gold & gold stocks were already in a bull market by the time the S&P 500 turned around in late 2002.
4629 2018-06-08 00:48:50 Yep, AR-15’s are the answer. Cause they know you can’t go up against rifles with a pistol. Let’s turn schools into combat zones & have raging gun battles. If we give them bump stocks, it can be full auto. Armor piercing would allow teachers to shoot the bad guys through walls.
4630 2018-06-08 00:47:51 I use David Fish's spreadsheet to filter through dividend champions, challengers, and contenders. Some of the filters include P/E < 20, yield > 3%, avg. DGR > 6%, PR% < 60%, etc.. I'd probably sell the stocks if their dividends slow down too much or actually get cut.
4631 2018-06-08 00:45:53 They do research on ongoing basis and they draw conclusions. Sometimes the right one, sometimes not. Do note they laud the company's high quality, including sticky quality customers. So this is a short term call $IRI #ausbiz #XJO #investing #equities #stocks

4640 2018-06-08 00:39:46 Bump Stocks need to be banned from possession.  There is no legitimate need to alter an AR-15 to be evuivalent to a full automatic weapon.  These altered were responsible for the high death rate in the Las Vagas mass shooting.
4641 2018-06-08 00:38:54 Oh get over yourself every time you tweet you look more insane. Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
4642 2018-06-08 00:38:23 is it bad that i want it
4643 2018-06-08 00:38:11 Bump Stocks must be banned. There is no rational reason for Automatic Weapons on our streets, in our schools or in our homes. They're weapons of WAR. NOT a weapon to take out hunting.

4654 2018-06-08 00:32:26 Good point. Big funds can't move into small/illiquid markets without affecting asset prices too much. It's the reason why huge funds also can't build material positions in micro-cap stocks. How do you move the alpha needle buying into a $150M market cap stock with a $50B fund?
4655 2018-06-08 00:31:34 The ARs were used for the ability to add bump stocks to them. Other than that, an AR 15 has far more positive uses than negative, and will be punishing law abiding citizens for the actions that a criminal will commit with any other pistol in the first place.

4674 2018-06-08 00:19:16 Stock buybacks produce future revenues, when the stocks are sold and the higher the price the higher the tax revenue. Companies are invented to keep and reinvest there money her. That's the point if the tax cut.
