2 2018-03-14 23:42:27 I think for too many people leftist political factions are brands. like cults, subcultures and fandoms, they are identity-commodities which provide the satisfaction of group identity, in/out group conflict, a sense of elite/special belonging and moral/intellectual superiority

6 2018-03-14 22:57:48 Yet tokens that are divisible will not be technically considered scarce if coming from a commodities stand point. Divisibility means speculating on the value of a full token (or the value of the fraction that it was previously purchased at). That sounds like a security to me.

It will go up again because the commodities price are up , and the growth China is strong lead the growth in Australia

How many of them hold their wealth in physical currency?

It's in real estate, private businesses, fine art, stocks, bonds, commodities, etc.

32 2018-03-14 21:50:29 An interesting element of the libertarian movement I don’t hear people talk about is their treatment of children as property.  That’s a core element of the libertarians despite their claims of individual freedom.  They see kids as objects, commodities, like animals.

36 2018-03-14 21:37:23 You also aren't fully applying the principle in question.  If deflationary money causes people to hoard money to get rich, depriving the economy of investment, then inflationary money should cause people to hoard commodities, depriving economy of resources.
37 2018-03-14 21:34:22 A respectful request:
May we attempt to move away from using the word "Franchise" to describe a movie series. Makes them sound like commodities, figures on a ledger, something to be bought & sold, rather than a cinematic work.

Also, a TV can kill a person if a gun can. The TV can sneak up behind someone and crash onto their head, right? Oh, and those cars, don't get me started on them... or knives, trains, planes.. baseball bats..and those hands that strangle..
48 2018-03-14 20:43:12 i have to disagree. the new form of art that emerged during the 1920s in russia celebrated beauty in everyday commodities like tractors rather than abstract expressionist ideals
49 2018-03-14 20:42:01 @larry_kudlow now that you are Trump's top financial advisor, you're gonna convince him that Bitcoin is not real currency, therefore ICOs are not really securities, and digit assets  are not real, so they cannot be considered commodities, so there cant be regulations on fake $$$
50 2018-03-14 20:36:31 Our government are the one we must blame for interms of restrictions of commodities of goods and services in SA Bcom these company they been given the power to robe us,and government want the tax
51 2018-03-14 20:33:00 I'm not suggesting we'll stop using commodities like steel or whatever, but the volumes we consume might change rather significantly. #WDYM
52 2018-03-14 20:24:25 I think a lot of it to do with the current economic climate. 

Some commodities are more readily available than in previous generations, i.e. soy beans.
53 2018-03-14 20:22:14 They’ll be hot commodities out on the market… 
54 2018-03-14 20:19:45 I heard about the commodities market, but I wonder if there will be enough effort to distribute its goods, if there are so many people willing to consume so much but are unwilling to recommend anything in particular.
55 2018-03-14 20:19:41 Norway and Venezuela are both mixed-economy/social democracies/whatever the fuck you want to call it, with things like education and healthcare decommodified and administrated by the state, while the majority of commodities production is done in the private sector.
56 2018-03-14 20:16:07 Hey Moron!  Have you ever heard term “supply and demand”?  Could it just be that we, America, have a demand for X commodities and the country shipping it to us (supply) does not (have a demand for this, or any others)? This creates an imbalance. U r making unfair.
57 2018-03-14 20:04:27 I think a great number of people would ride the dollar down a long, long way, certain that it was sure to recover. Others would take their chances with the CHF, EUR, JPY, and maybe even the CNY and the RUB. Others would go heavily into commodities. And, of course, equities.
58 2018-03-14 19:49:55 6. Where am I headed with this? A passive long investment in various commodities or developed world commodity ETFs (or blends of ETFs), will produce returns that are identical to the market returns (i.e. betas) of most African bourses.
59 2018-03-14 19:48:39 2. African equity indexes track commodities. For instance:
60 2018-03-14 19:48:27 1. I am going to say something heretical about African equities, commodities and investment in African public markets. Hopefully, the heresy won't overshadow the positive point I seek to articulate:
61 2018-03-14 19:44:36 “She is the personification of Marx’s commodity fetishism, totally dominated by the commodities she is compelled to buy; as pure desire, desire for the commodity, she teaches US what WE must desire (snif snif)”
62 2018-03-14 19:43:00 Oq colocou o brasil na quinta economia do mundo foi o preço dos commodities que subiu
63 2018-03-14 19:38:01 Great article by @LandrySigne. I think one of the big mistakes the West has made over the past decades is continue to view #Africa as a source of raw commodities, not as a place of value creation. Their lack of investment in value-added sectors is most myopic & unfortunate.
64 2018-03-14 19:36:26 Some of us do! I love animals (including some humans!) but like most countries in the world we have those who see animals as nothing more than commodities to be exploited for profit and entertainment.
65 2018-03-14 19:35:04 Sure your right about avioding mob mentality, but we aren't arguing to treat women like crap, we're arguing about treating people like humans rather then commodities. Context plays a huge role in this.
66 2018-03-14 19:18:34 Thank you my duly elected president! Keep winning the haters will learn.

God save US!
67 2018-03-14 19:04:12 Our Gov makes $$ from the commodities market. America working and businesses growing bring more tax revenue. Developers create a bond market. All of it funnels towards our gov's earnings. The trade deals Trump is working on will save huge for gov Saving $$ cuts gov costs
68 2018-03-14 18:58:03 The Jeremy Hunts and ministers of this world need to identify with individuals of care! You not just a workforce or resource to be commodities of business. You are people with names that deliver the care to patients with names.
69 2018-03-14 18:50:53 Sports athletes are humans first and then sadly slide into commodities.  Human first, try to remember that,
70 2018-03-14 18:46:36 The thing is though, that the value of labor is in reality just as abstract for the widget producer as the software writer. Most (all maybe) commodities are the crystallized labor of all the workers who contributed to it. Starting with all the tools and machines we use.
71 2018-03-14 18:44:44 Thanks ... yea... not good.

#DoNotSubmit is my phrase . Submit to God (or dogs!) but not to humans. Submitting to other humans is the path that leads to slavery and false gods. When people are reduced to commodities all kinds of horror comes with it.

74 2018-03-14 18:42:47 i was only using the factory as an example. i agree that a sales clerk is still indisputably proletariat. they are selling their labour to the capitalist class. but that labour's value is abstracted by the lack of physical commodities, which instead come from the "third world"

90 2018-03-14 16:57:59 Yes, commodities are big for Canada, but FX traders have exaggerated that take on the currency. Across industries, cross-border trade is phenomenal. It’s supposedly easier to trade with the U.S. than across provincial boundaries.

232 2018-03-14 07:55:55 The financial assumptions change so quickly at #commodities trader Noble Group that's difficult to keep up. In late January, it told investors it would make operating income of $275-$300 million by 2019 after debt restructuring. Today, it's saying it will make just $250 million.

254 2018-03-14 05:27:26 The sensationalists who are responding pretend like a strong dollar doesn't hurt our manufacturing base. They also forget that the Loonie is generally weaker than the USD. Plus the BoC considers this the sweet spot for manufacturing growth while not hurting commodities.

259 2018-03-14 04:30:31 Like the precious metals & other commodities, oil has a long-term inverse correlation to the USD, even if in the short-term oil can diverge from this relationship because it’s vulnerable to oil-specific supply & demand shocks.
260 2018-03-14 04:25:49 Gold and silver, like other commodities, have an intrinsic value, which is not arbitrary, but is dependent on their scarcity, the quantity of labour bestowed in procuring them, and the value of the capital employed in the mines which

"each agency looks at tokens from its own narrow perspective:
SEC says these assets, particularly ICO’s, are probably securities;
CFTC says tokens are commodities, unless they are securities;
IRS says they are property;
FinCEN says tokens are money"

282 2018-03-14 01:39:49 True that. With the #Wyoming #model #blockchain #law that exempts token not marketed as #investment from #money transmission law et al, #SEC seeing tokens as #securities, #FinCen as #money, and #CFTC as #commodities, the coast seems pretty clear already.
283 2018-03-14 01:28:11 In the end the military industrial complex earns a lot of $$$ nott to mention the corporations that go in to rebuild infrastructure and charge oil & commodities of said countries I like to call it war for profit
284 2018-03-14 01:26:09 Today’s inflation numbers should have put all this death of the bond bull market to rest. Just look at the divergence between China’s PPI & CPI. This synthetic rise in commodities has not been passed from producers to consumers for a reason.

287 2018-03-14 01:13:22 Gringos complain about their government too much. Try living in Venuzuela or Honduras for a week and see if you still "hate" the US. Half of you pussies wouldn't survive without the commodities Americans have here.
288 2018-03-14 01:11:02 All political parties have same agenda grabbing power and enjoying. People are just commodities. Already sold out when deadliest political system was introduced.
289 2018-03-14 00:54:28 We are talking about a man who thinks loyalty, honesty, justice and trustworthiness are commodities, not virtues or consequences.
290 2018-03-14 00:53:40 Arnold is ideologically intoxicated. Oil companies do not force humanity to use their commodities. They provide their products in response to market demand. If suitable, alternative materials were available at competitive costs, they would use less petroleum.

298 2018-03-14 00:11:08 Why not ignore it entirely as long as you can ensure those things deemed basic rights? Logically if you can just ignore non essential commodities the whole thing stops affecting you. If you think about it folks like the Amish have already done this.
299 2018-03-14 00:05:51 One can envision a strange state of affairs where food, education, housing and health care systems are Marxist in character but everything else (i.e things/commodities not deemed a human right)  runs on a Capitalist economic model.
