12 2018-09-26 23:48:10 Well, i started 2 weeks ago. few things that were actually stopping me before is: 
1. No premarket trading
2. Shitty customer service
3. Most penny stocks were not available as of my friend was trading there.

42 2018-09-26 23:41:17 When does seasonality begin for these energy stocks ?
43 2018-09-26 23:40:02 Great ! I'm looking forward to it. I'm having a bit of a tough time finding vegan stocks to invest in individually.
44 2018-09-26 23:40:01 Yung mga morning shift dito sa team grabe passion sa stocks. Na-eencourage tuloy ako haha
45 2018-09-26 23:39:26 This doesn’t necessarily mean coinbase’s users are lower net worth.

I’d guess most people would place a larger portion of networth in stocks/bonds vs. crypto
46 2018-09-26 23:38:24 alright enough politics.  back to stocks
47 2018-09-26 23:37:44 My net-worth is growing by the thousands every week or two just off stocks alone. #ifitdontmakemoneyitdontmakesense
48 2018-09-26 23:37:03 This has to be the dumbest decision I've seen in years. If he wanted to go to a strong club both GWS and Richmond are light on for ruck stocks. Will destroy his career at Melbourne
49 2018-09-26 23:36:43 @billgunderson  HI bill. FYI. On the app, all stocks have a 11.42 fwd pe so the app is not working properly.
50 2018-09-26 23:36:30 Why not allow boats to operate some of those freezing plants. More quota (& revenue) per boat would take the pressure off fish stocks... less urge to lobby for more all the time. Boats would need more employees & pay would be much higher than land plant jobs. Safety improves too.
51 2018-09-26 23:35:22 I get what your saying, adding attachments to weapons flash hider, suppressor x8 scopes stocks, and that frying pan that rikashaes bullets was nice but the graphics could be a little better as well as the character movement. What’s fortnite since it not shooter?
52 2018-09-26 23:33:44 Economy: same trend that started under Obama. Somewhat higher monthly avg of new jobs under Obama, growth >4.1% four times; stocks went from 8000 to 20,000; degraded ISIS by 75%; deported more than any previous president and illegal entry went down....
53 2018-09-26 23:32:36 Start with self rationalization. Allow those who wanna/need to retire to sell to current skippers who need more access to stocks in order to provide stable employment. Allow those to wander into quality maximization through at-sea processing. Govt/union asking for new plants now.
54 2018-09-26 23:32:21 Yeah and he takes Two scoops of ice cream.  you’re embarrassing yourself
55 2018-09-26 23:31:59 Oh they laughed but not at him but rather the humiliation nd degradation the Dems have made of our judicial process! We are the laughing stocks!
56 2018-09-26 23:30:33 Sounds like American steel stocks will be doing well.
57 2018-09-26 23:29:03 My guess is 3 things:
1-some of it actually IS priced in — stocks of firms in tradeabke sector have been hit;
2-can’t forget that the US tradeable sector isn’t huge; and
3-biggest for: there’s no cliff. It’s a long, slow, boil. In the end the frog dies, but not everyone sees it.
58 2018-09-26 23:24:42 Relationships will always be synonymous to stocks
59 2018-09-26 23:22:35 my stocks went ??? somewhere?
60 2018-09-26 23:22:14 Yes! Considering momentum has worked really well and value has been OK why do you think Stocks that COMBINE both Value and Momentum have been so bad
61 2018-09-26 23:21:21 We can never be surprised when Republicans are projecting their dark urges onto other people. Not that Clinton wasn't a douchebag to women. But the Starr folks act like Puritans ready to put people in the stocks while indulging themselves in behavior that's as bad or worse.

63 2018-09-26 23:19:25 I have friends talking pot stocks, asking for tips as if they wanted drugs
64 2018-09-26 23:18:54 Don't play the penny stocks.
65 2018-09-26 23:17:38 @EDWARDTRILEY Hi Ed I have a question for you. Is it common for growth stocks that fit your system to pop and then sell off on day 2. Or is that a signal of a false break. I'm seeing an awful lot of pop and sell on tickers that are TL or others that are like PLNT. thx
66 2018-09-26 23:17:36 I use it in gravy, stocks and casseroles instead 9f salt sometimes. It's yummy.
67 2018-09-26 23:17:16 I know u geeked cause when Canada legalize the weed the stocks finna be crazy what other stocks u got ahold of I’m holding some cronos and canopy growth rn but they jawns not doing shit
68 2018-09-26 23:16:42 I love when people rap me up about stocks
69 2018-09-26 23:15:23 Yes. In principal almost all of those could be private. Remember in 1989 that we almost had a flat tax (!). There were seven fat years so electorate didn't mind. Or remember in 1999 when everyone was asking why SoSec wasn't in stocks. But patience . . .
70 2018-09-26 23:15:17 Better than losing your ass on weed stocks.
71 2018-09-26 23:15:01 Stocks Let’s Talk is a good podcast, Dave takes the pro
72 2018-09-26 23:14:19 Bad move! Tax “breaks” don’t help those in need...more money in their pockets on a weekly basis does. Poor people don’t invest in stocks and RESPs and luxuries. They invest in the local economy: food on the table, clothing for themselves and their children, medicines as needed...
73 2018-09-26 23:14:19 My stocks certainly aren't.
74 2018-09-26 23:13:59 Oh no. The only thing I do on the computer is trade stocks during the day. And play frisbie with my dog Ellie. Thats how I make extra money now that I'm retired.
75 2018-09-26 23:12:53 Kelly Bryant and Jalen hurts needs to transfer to D2 schools and try to salvage their draft stocks
76 2018-09-26 23:10:39 @PericlesDeAvila  Mr. DeAvilia, I am one of many shareholders that own stock in $SECI. With the suspension that came today, I hope that all goes well on October 5th with our case. Stocks do not fair very well in the market after they have been suspended. Good Luck
77 2018-09-26 23:09:59 @brandonkrieg1, I wish you could deposit $5 into your @Stash account & then pick 5 stocks/ETFs to invest $1 into each of them. I think more people would invest if you could in invest less than $5 at a time.
78 2018-09-26 23:09:45 Yes, could be. Sometimes it works great. Like I said, if factory workers were making trendline income ($100k) no one would be demanding anything other than catastrophic gov healthcare. If factories were making $200k and stocks steady, maybe private annuities could replace SoSec.
79 2018-09-26 23:05:26 Common few TV anchors yesterday only repeatedly mentioning that IT #Stocks has lost the esteem!! #Brotip
80 2018-09-26 23:05:21 Is there a date when it goes off the shop because it's preorders or is it while stocks last?
81 2018-09-26 23:04:27 I know I speak for all of your followers that we will miss Bug. He not only had a great nose for treats, but for stocks as well. It is always hard to lose an animal companion but the greatest gift you could give was to not allow his suffering to continue. You will see him again.
82 2018-09-26 23:03:54 @austin_truex DUDE TELL ME ABOUT POT STOCKS NOW
83 2018-09-26 23:03:32 And stocks take a pretty serious dip as if nobody saw this coming.
84 2018-09-26 23:03:27 Thanks for bringing this to our attention. Does the issue remain if you look at other stocks? What about in the 10-Year view, does everything appear normal there? Have you tried restarting the app to see if the issue resolves?

88 2018-09-26 22:58:22 penny stocks are back
89 2018-09-26 22:57:52 Wow! You guys seem to be doing all you can to destroy wild salmon stocks. Voters will remember and hold you responsible for eco disaster.
90 2018-09-26 22:57:13 Tefs regarding penny stocks need to fill a certain criteria to be tradedable
91 2018-09-26 22:56:21 If kavanaugh is not confirmed Republicans will stop voting. Schumer, Warren and Rachel Maddow will take over. Own gun stocks and gold.
92 2018-09-26 22:56:19 “Blackout period”?? Are companies not allowed to buy stocks in October?
93 2018-09-26 22:55:37 It's September.  A notoriously bad month for stocks.  Yet we're doing pretty good.
94 2018-09-26 22:55:29 $GWPH like dude know any bong stocks?
95 2018-09-26 22:54:03 Taxes are lowered for d 1%,u might gt a $20 break,& the stock market went up bcuz restrictions we're lifted bcuz d banks & corporations did shady investments during d finiancial crisis which u don't have a clue about. And I bet u don't invest in any stocks moron
96 2018-09-26 22:53:59 Hey Steve, I see tht u r booking out on several trades. Do u anticipate this fall to continue or is it just that those stocks hit the SL (to protect ur profits) you had kept for yourself.
97 2018-09-26 22:53:51 there IS 1 thing I hate more than root canals. Its prepping chit for taxes. Thank God for my accountant. But I gotta do like 40 hours of work before I even HAND it to him to crunch! If this form is right, I got 45 million in stocks traded & 425 pages. I think I am going to cry 
98 2018-09-26 22:53:09 @jehronp i know I’m super late at this but i saw that @timothysykes shouted you out on one of his YouTube videos...I’m interested in investing in penny stocks...looking to network and learn this game.
99 2018-09-26 22:52:37 @foimbert Funny that Bank stocks dropped with rate increase. That is usually good for them as increases their spread on loans which is what they wanted.
100 2018-09-26 22:51:20 Yeah, so terrible, my stocks and 401k is a disaster, quick, call the waaaambulance!
101 2018-09-26 22:51:09 Have you been paid yet? It seems they are restricting many more stocks to trade lately; what's your experience with this?
102 2018-09-26 22:50:46 These weed stocks I haven’t had time to do my research like I was doing last week last week I made so much money off my stocks I sold 
103 2018-09-26 22:50:44 Stocks now in the red heading into the close of trading.
104 2018-09-26 22:50:30  Check these #stocks that reached all-time highs: $PGR
105 2018-09-26 22:50:11 *hire lol  got weed stocks on my mind still
106 2018-09-26 22:48:32 Even their net worth doesn't apparently represent the amount of cash they have at hand. Some of that is stake in the company ownership, brand value, or their stocks in the market.
107 2018-09-26 22:47:58 Wealth or income? For wealth, first of all, we're in a gargantuan asset bubble (especially stocks, bonds, coastal real estate)--after it bursts, this is likely to come in quite a bit. Second, too much corporate power--squashes down labor capture, co-opts gov't and juices margins.
108 2018-09-26 22:47:27 I’ve been losing money with my stocks the past few days 
109 2018-09-26 22:47:21 Our apologies, Prithviraj. We have no specific time frame to provide at the moment. Please choose the option "Notify Me" on the order page to receive an email once stocks are back. Thanks for your patience and understanding.
110 2018-09-26 22:47:08 Imagine if there were no interest rates & rich people were forced to spend / take risks, & you only get what you work for.
This is insane the richest people should be those who work not those who invest in stocks that can afford to buy stocks back years ago. This is a ponzi.
111 2018-09-26 22:45:31  Have a look these #stocks that marked all-time highs: $HPQ, $SQ, $TEAM, $SAP
112 2018-09-26 22:44:35 Do you know how stocks work? You can literally buy stocks. Unless $140 is rich people money to you.
113 2018-09-26 22:44:35 You...own stocks?
114 2018-09-26 22:44:21 Hello, Russia!
115 2018-09-26 22:43:47 Stocks close slightly higher, trimming earlier gains
116 2018-09-26 22:42:31 Noted. However, I caution against trading stocks when @jimcramer open his mouth. 
CC:@RudyHavenstein
117 2018-09-26 22:41:23 stock market is high & inflation is low. We can agree on that. Then if Fed tightens too much, the market will collapse. This is true whether inflation is low like now or a bit higher. Either way when stocks invariably go down someday the concern will be gdp & falling prices
118 2018-09-26 22:40:26 *gets winded from changing shirts*
119 2018-09-26 22:39:35 I’m retired self employed blacktopper at 50 yes teach me about trade deficits my stocks are screaming girlfriends 401 is rockin 4. GDP .

121 2018-09-26 22:38:15 More documents then any other justice please you’re all about delay regardless of the cost! Shame!
122 2018-09-26 22:35:29 I dont understand why so many of these stocks arent moving.Why is western uranium damn near going parabolic, Fission is moving sideways and Cameco is going down?What gives? They should all be creeping up. If this was oil, with a 30% commodity increase, they would all be flying!
123 2018-09-26 22:35:18 I agree, its not so much about marijuana stocks as it is about the liberals putting gender equality above being competitive on the world energy stage
124 2018-09-26 22:35:10 This stuff looks so cool and I cannot wait to get a chance to play with the new tools. Will there be a Q&A for H17 ?
125 2018-09-26 22:35:00 Stocks are approaching overvalued. Raising rates. Confusing the market more than ever. Are we sure trump put this clown in there?
126 2018-09-26 22:31:21 A Few Quick Questions:

Did congress ever vote on Bump stocks??
How is Melania's cyber bully program doing? #FLOTUS
Does giving farmers billion for loss revenue fall under tag of Socialism / Socialist activities??
127 2018-09-26 22:30:39 What about when the USD tanks, what happens to stocks? It's called a store of value for a reason
128 2018-09-26 22:30:27 I'm making good money. My stocks and IRAs are doing great.  Besides, I  was saying all these things way before President Trump was even running for office. So brainwashed, no, patriot, veteran, and a nurse who cares about all Americans, not just those with my views.#submariner

133 2018-09-26 22:23:16 The only thing better than #NationalPancakeDay, is the first National Pancake Day after #CannabisLegalization in Canada! Just imagine

But #NutritionalHigh, #Dixie and #Tinley have #edibles so good, they’ll make you forget all about pancakes! Get these stocks in your portfolio.

136 2018-09-26 22:21:23 Very true. @pauljohnson9691 must be so desperate he feels the need to ramp every day his stocks he is obviously losing on. Flogging a dead horse springs to mind. He has lost his touch along with a large portion of his cash. #payback

139 2018-09-26 22:16:19 Interesting how there’s an entire new crop of pot stocks being gobbled up with zero mention of any tickers from the last wave of weed mania. Those names just sit, forgotten with prices unchanged, as the finance news hype machine churns on...
140 2018-09-26 22:15:10 @AskRobinhood Will you be listing Elastic Search pre ipo or post ipo? In the past you've listed some stocks pre ipo

142 2018-09-26 22:14:52 For hard to borrow stocks, do you have to reserve shares in order to have shares available to short?
143 2018-09-26 22:14:46 Well, I for one am not going to any rallies or concerts in Las Vegas. Ever. Bump Stocks are still legal. Apparently, the idiots aren't entirely dumb.
144 2018-09-26 22:13:02 Yahoo been heavy pushing Canadian weed stocks. Something bout to break in the market?
145 2018-09-26 22:12:51 How is the short availability on hard-to-borrow penny stocks?
146 2018-09-26 22:12:49 Don't count me as in the know. From an economics point of view they do have a point. PBR lives and ties by the rate of return. Those putting their capital in a program could just as easily put their money into stocks, bonds, condos or rentals elsewhere.
147 2018-09-26 22:12:33 Say it isn’t so, another one?
Last January, I predicted Celgene (CELG) and Biogen (BIIB) would be the best-performing, large-cap biotech stocks in 2016. As I type this column, Celgene is down 3%, Biogen is down 8%. He’s right and he’s wrong. Grain of salt with his words folks

151 2018-09-26 22:10:05 I know one thing: if we allow people to buy guns with 30 round magazines and bump stocks, the death rate in mass shootings will logically go up. I also would far rather face a loon with a knife than a loon with an AR-15. I’d have a better chance of getting away.
152 2018-09-26 22:09:57 MU is getting interesting. It’s daytrading only on that for a bit longer. But it’s setting up (like a lot of stocks) for a good swing.

182 2018-09-26 21:49:58 Elle a raison, les prix varient selon les stocks, c’est normal, un XXXL est beaucoup plus dur à vendre qu’un M par exemple, et vu au prix au quel ils l’achètent, ils peuvent se permettre de le mettre à ce prix là, et quand même faire une bonne marge dessus!
183 2018-09-26 21:49:29 I’ll invest in anything if I see the opportunity. The market is forward valuing highly any stocks it perceives are the future. You have to take this into consideration. It happened in 1929, 1999 and it’s happening now and plenty of smaller cycles.

Of agreeable listeners where the innocence has unpacked--

A poem should be favourable
As the completeness of prospectus .
191 2018-09-26 21:46:04 If the Fed projections of good growth and contained inflation are broadly right (which I think they are) it seems likely to pause hiking by mid-19 after 2 or 3 more strikes. That would be good news for stocks if the rally can last that long!

213 2018-09-26 21:26:57 The stock market rolls as does its stocks - held by the rich and manipulated, so not an indicator. Unemployment is not a measure of employment, so not an indicator. Wages are stagnant - an indicator. So FR Chairman - you are full of caca.
214 2018-09-26 21:26:30 Its all an illusion. The raising of rates is so they can lower it again next sign of trouble. They will continue buying up bonds to prop the whole thing up. They will directly buy up stocks as much as needed.
215 2018-09-26 21:26:12 There's been a lot of chatter that the frenzy around pot stocks has much in common with the bitcoin frenzy. Is that a fair comparison?

234 2018-09-26 21:11:43 Question of degrees? I have been talking about it in terms of immediacy. The middle class would have been more likely to immediately spend a tax cut on goods and services whereas the tax cut, as structured just bought more stocks, credits and Treasuries for wealthier households.

239 2018-09-26 21:10:27 Trading stocks is not about how much money you make, but how many times your right! One trade can make you a lot of money, your next can lose it all. When you right majority of the time, money will come on its own. Learn to be right! Stay discipline!

256 2018-09-26 21:04:12 I don’t have a firm view on this.  In general I think all boats will rise.  But think premium in tech stocks is likley to drop a bit.

258 2018-09-26 21:02:28 Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) price at close, 2018-09-26, is 312.01.
259 2018-09-26 21:02:05 I hope the stocks dip 10-20% before the 17th
260 2018-09-26 21:01:51 Facebook Inc (FB) price at close, 2018-09-26, is 168.04.
261 2018-09-26 21:01:35 Problem with all the FAANG stocks, TSLA, crap like that, is they have action every single day.  Hard to single out anything special.  I look for stuff that is unusual, repeated, big, rare, out of ordinary, etc etc
262 2018-09-26 21:01:11 Alphabet Inc.("Google") - Class A (GOOGL) price at close, 2018-09-26, is 1194.0601.
263 2018-09-26 21:01:11 I agree, several stocks need another push higher, but that could only result in a b-wave on the indices. Correct, I showed the 5th of the possible completed ED as 5 waves, but it can easily be counted as a, b, (a),(b). Indeed many possibilities, hence caution certainly adviced.
264 2018-09-26 21:01:01 Microsoft Corp (MSFT) price at close, 2018-09-26, is 113.96.

269 2018-09-26 20:56:57 Yield curve has renewed flattening. Copper and lumber are weak as demand for housing and cars slows globally. (Trade war also an issue.) If stocks begin to buckle, coincident indicators of peak growth may be put in place. Markets under-pricing non-economic risk, as well. Careful.
270 2018-09-26 20:56:22 Will stocks provide the income the baby boom generation is seeking ?
271 2018-09-26 20:55:49 Most individual stocks have incomplete looking topping patterns and have not broken any major support, the 5th of a diagonal is rarely the longest subwave, and technically a 3-3-5 subwave structure is not valid for an ED (all subwaves must subdivide as 3).
272 2018-09-26 20:54:28 This are the quotes of the day by the chairman of the Fed, Powell:

- “Policy is still accommodative” (Imagen now the European Central Bank )
- “By some valuation measures, stocks high historically” (It is better to say nothing about this comment…)

283 2018-09-26 20:50:30 He is 100% right, but anyone rich enough can employ some very good artists. Unfortunately Corbyn will ensure the artists advise their clients to up stocks and leave the country, leaving the middle classes to pick up the tab
284 2018-09-26 20:49:19 So are we assuming bank stocks to go up if rates left alone. I think not.

 Please tell my why not TRUMP.
288 2018-09-26 20:46:09 Having been almost dormant over the dry summer, the autumn flush of #grass seems to be growing almost like spring. Maybe reduced feed stocks won't be as bad as expected. Also higher D values than most wet Septs.
289 2018-09-26 20:44:47 @WallstBull69 because that’s what overvalued stocks do
290 2018-09-26 20:43:40 You're right. And the bond propping is like the boy who cried wolf.

When the day comes when big money jumps to bonds because it knows "they" are about to sacrifice stocks to save the bond market, we won't think twice about the irrational bond buying.

It's the new normal.
291 2018-09-26 20:43:36 Nice!

302 2018-09-26 20:36:10 Depends on what hemp/CBD stocks you own.  Could help international ones, right?  Don't think it demolishes the thesis, because CBD sales will continue to rise.  Does hurt some of the reasons people were buying, and won't help lower prices as much.

318 2018-09-26 20:28:03 Well stocks are based on manipulated PE ratios right now. Almost every company is operating far lower than their stock price reflects. Watch for a crash. Last time it was like this subprime housing market tanked us. It’s that simple again
319 2018-09-26 20:27:30 Interesting theory... could be. Gonna wait for it to stabilize. It'll be one of the last stocks to blow up and pay dividends by the nature of its business, but it'll be worth it long term.

322 2018-09-26 20:26:51 Powell is learning from Trump. Nothing like saying stocks are expensive and we have unsustainable growth during open market hours. Don't have to worry about it running too fast considering he trimmed half a percent and about 750 billion off the us stock market in 15 minutes.

331 2018-09-26 20:21:59 Fed did it too late. Stocks over grew too much. So when accommodation is gone, stocks will have a big headache. If fed did it four years early, the reaction would be far more smooth and market  would keep  years by itself without accommodation. Now we can only pray.

354 2018-09-26 20:14:59 As is their custom, stocks rally after entirely expected Fed rate hike, then fall. 

Dow ends -106, -0.4% to 26,385. S&P -0.3%, Nasdaq -0.2%.

And, ouch: Russell 2000 small-stock index -1.0%.

359 2018-09-26 20:11:25 Everybody get over the idea the Fed focuses on stocks. The Fed needs to keep everyone in bonds & cash via interest rate sophistry when investors should already be stampeding into hard assets. This is the only game in town.
360 2018-09-26 20:11:08 That was the dotcom thinking in a nutshell.  "Internet/e-commerce is inevitable, therefore, all tech startup stocks are gold."

363 2018-09-26 20:09:52 What are the flagship stocks in these industries you think?
364 2018-09-26 20:09:50 yes, but apparantly, from what i understood, our interpertation of it was incorrect. paying deposits is still better than buying stocks, or something like that. 
365 2018-09-26 20:09:43 Great call.  Have missed a couple of breakouts on my watchlist this week ... cus I'm watching 50 stocks!
366 2018-09-26 20:09:43 Of course they want to preserve the bubble in stocks.  That is the only thing anyone cares about .
367 2018-09-26 20:08:41 Looks like it I know Bank Stocks Industrials & Commodities are always last to the parties. Let’s see how Treasuries behave in the very near future.
368 2018-09-26 20:08:23 World stocks ex US higher: Europe +.3%; US -.3%. FED raises interest-rates .25% market basically yawns as it was expected. More significant, FED sees 3+% GDP for 2018 but less than 3% for 2019.  Market will try to balance trade issues and growing economy even if growth slows.
369 2018-09-26 20:08:13 How can you have multiple Baltimore moments when you can only clinch on the last game of the season, like in Baltimore, on the last day of the season?
370 2018-09-26 20:08:02 I agree. And look at the slope of the 90s stocks over that three year period compared to the slope of the FAANG stocks over the 5 year period. I think the gradual hikes won’t be a sudden kill, but more of a slow decline in equity, depending on what bond market does.

385 2018-09-26 20:04:47 Yes - or buffer stocks of frozen fruit
386 2018-09-26 20:04:17 For me, we just aren’t there yet. I’m waiting for my dad to ask me about weed stocks, then .... the we have arrived. 
You listen to the latest time Ferris podcast w/ Howard Marks? Super interesting thoughts from a boss hoss.
387 2018-09-26 20:04:11 #USD slightly rising again. 
US 30y 3.18%
Stocks keep dropping.
388 2018-09-26 20:03:51 it’s fucking ridiculous the kind of things certain characters/moves have. you gotta play with like 8 stocks
389 2018-09-26 20:03:50 I think the stock market will get destroyed long before gold rallies. It's only when Fed jams rates negative that we'll see an appreciable rally, and my expectation is that it will be a sight to behold. Too bad though, because I'll be buying gutter stocks for pennies >:)
390 2018-09-26 20:03:39 Stocks are so red today I need  blood transfusion. 
391 2018-09-26 20:03:31 Don’t worry, stocks that can’t fund themselves from internal cash flows are still up today. $TSLA $NFLX $TLRY $W
392 2018-09-26 20:03:20 As expected, Fed raised interest rates by 25 basis points today which sent the Dow to a 100 point gain before weakness in bank stocks reversed that gain to a 100 point loss.

394 2018-09-26 20:03:00 $pyx if you believe these MJ stocks have a chance at success, you have to believe PYX is position better than any of them and can turn on the switch overnight..and if MJ doesn't go well..you still have a solid tobacco co.

396 2018-09-26 20:01:45 Stocks drop after Fed chair says stocks are expensive
397 2018-09-26 20:01:24 Oh bond, sell your stocks when u can. American stocks always fall fast, double faster than they go up. I hope they won't go down too quick. Bond is obviously changing it's direction since 1982. The bottom for bond was for sure. It may not go up but the long term downward is over.
398 2018-09-26 20:01:21 Oh God, I just saw stocks are down #rigged PPT needs to step in!
399 2018-09-26 20:01:12 Breaking (4:01 PM EDT): Dow drops about 100 points as bank stocks fall following the Fed decision -- CNBC
400 2018-09-26 20:00:55 Investors don't want a basket of 100 socially responsible stocks. Instead, they want a handful of specifically selected companies.

The future of ESG is fractional share investing. And so is the rest of the investment management industry.

483 2018-09-26 19:27:35 Yes. US stocks often have a super voting share structure. It confuse things. I figure there is less than 1% of the actual float available publically to trade. This could go full parabolic.

504 2018-09-26 19:19:56 Yeah, I couldn’t bring myself to invest in tobacco or fast food stocks either.  I can’t invest in a company that’s trying to help the banks stay ahead when I believe in the financial independence idea of Bitcoin. Anne I’ll have less money, but I’ll also have cleaner karma!

527 2018-09-26 19:04:14 $nbev ATM offering no problem. Actually was a great move.  Co now flush with cash.  If they can pull off lower end of guidance (90m revs) & using new outstanding of 57m shares, @ $6 the market cap = 342m and Price to Sales would be 3.8.  Very low relative to other CBD stocks.
528 2018-09-26 19:03:57 @jpmorgan $jpm AND $bac @BankofAmerica stocks fell off cliffs for NO reason. And Jamie Dimon says we dont need buybacks
529 2018-09-26 19:03:31 So Western Uranium shareholders in 6 months saw a 440% gain.  Better than the FANG stocks.  And it is just starting.  This is URANIUM at the start of a Bull Market....with a tad of Vanadium!
530 2018-09-26 19:03:04 Fed Chair Powell shoots down calls to increase the countercyclical capital buffer for big banks:

"It remains a tool for tool kit when we need to deploy it. I’m in the camp of seeing vulnerabilities as relatively moderate."

532 2018-09-26 19:02:17 1. individual stocks + bonds > 2. SP500 ETFs > 3. mutual funds.

Ben hafta 1 saat bile düşünmek istemiyorum ve önümüzdeki recession'da da (1-2 sene) satmam diyorsan %0.4 güzel bence ama portfoyunun %40 küçülmesine de hazırlıklı ol. Tabi her türlü mutual'dan iyidir.
533 2018-09-26 19:01:44 Hi there. How do we sign up for a free month? I'm very interested. Thanks!
534 2018-09-26 19:01:32 Mince pies in the Coop, salt stocks for the roads. I guess Christmas isn't far away. 
535 2018-09-26 19:01:31 Good risk/reward on $QD here if the China stocks can get something going. Either that or window dressed into the new year.
536 2018-09-26 18:59:17 Stocks are still very cheap if we adjust the Warren Buffett metric for US Federal debt outstanding (we’ve talked about this before Jesse.)
537 2018-09-26 18:57:59 Well the low beta anomaly capitalizes on the fact that stocks RISK-ADJUSTED returns are declining on beta. The long-short "low beta" portfolio produces alpha only when controlling the beta exposure of the long-short portfolio.
538 2018-09-26 18:57:51 Two ways to spell  "Fed News."

541 2018-09-26 18:57:07 They'll buy stocks via QE next time. guaranteed
542 2018-09-26 18:56:59 An injury to pne is an injury to all. I hate segmenting relief by age cohort. Young people get sick too and even if they don’t, pay sucks and they can’t make ends meet either. Need to stop the price drivers - greedy investors wanting cap. Gains off stocks.
543 2018-09-26 18:56:43 Hmm really? That news missed my house because I'm paying more for health insurance, more for groceries, more for gas, fuel oil for the house, and my wages have not increased. My little bit of stocks haven't done a damn thing either. But tell me how I'm benefiting.
544 2018-09-26 18:56:11 Thinking bout investing into stocks
545 2018-09-26 18:55:48 I hate investing in stocks cause I always end up taking the money out prematurely. 

Probably better to invest in my skills/brand until I’m stacked tf up

555 2018-09-26 18:50:42 This why I have been telling u guys for years now. Ignore Fedspeak. If int rts are in control, nothing else matters. Stocks and real estate will continue to rise. There is no bubble bc there is no debt. Fed and world banks can wipe out debt w keystroke

558 2018-09-26 18:50:11 Thanks to technology, the structural change to inflation has moved neutral to pretty much where the #Fed is now. Rates markets have adjusted to this phenomenon quite well. Pragmatic Powell will keep things steady and focus on growth is my call. Bullish for stocks and the economy
559 2018-09-26 18:48:53 No trades for a slow day, didn't see anything that great and liquidity a little dry with everyone awaiting Fed minutes. Cash is a position too folks...don't force trades if you don't see it. Have a good day! #stocks #trading101 #daytraders

Also some bearishness on EU SSC side, hence whittling down stocks as you say. Mills say real demand still strong but SSCs do not seem to agree, otherwise why destock?

576 2018-09-26 18:43:21 I agree with @JulianMI2 on the idea that bund yields rising will release the anchor on treasury yields.  Tend to also agree regarding tech stocks due to inherent interest rate bet in tech equities.  Not sure julians view on overall equities but I am in the equities higher camp.

581 2018-09-26 18:42:25 Long term bonds are not selling on FOMC statement. It is likely to see more volatility in stocks soon, at least on a seasonal basis. Although the growth sectors appear to be leading today, the breadth remains very weak and still trends down. $SPX $RUT

583 2018-09-26 18:42:01 Oops! Another FED interest hike occurred. Hope it’s not wrecking the economy or cause great drop in stocks.
584 2018-09-26 18:41:26 The market's not minding the Fed's pace of rate hikes, with #3 in 2018 today, chances for another in December, and three more in 2018.  Its all based off a sanguine take on the economy. Stocks are up (S&P +.3%)as Powell is talking.

592 2018-09-26 18:39:13 Anyone posting ‘live, laugh, love’ should be banished from society - maybe also put in the stocks as a lesson to others... we could take it in turns to pelt them with old copies of ‘50 Shades of Grey’
593 2018-09-26 18:37:44 Stocks took a little downtick after Powell suggested people not read too much into dropping the accomodative language.
594 2018-09-26 18:37:25 The raised bump. Stocks weren't low at all.

610 2018-09-26 18:30:44 Have always felt that weakness in the all-issues A-D line reflected 1) a narrowing advance (like n FANGs currently OR 2) weakness in interest-sensitive stocks OR 3) both. Felt that the verdict was what was important rather than how it was reached.

666 2018-09-26 18:17:44 @PeterSchiff said (I) the FED couldn’t end QE (II) the FED could never Taper (III) the FED couldn’t raise rates from 0-0.25 bps without a stock market crash.  We are at 2-2.5 now. WRONG. 900% increase in rates. ATR highs in stocks! The balance sheet is shrinking. No melt-down

They threw everything into it.

It wasn't that much of a tick.
Review their stocks then watch what happens.
It was a false high.

Target tried similar but didn't have a year planning behind their decision.
So there's THAT.

681 2018-09-26 18:11:17 Seems like a pretty good decision to sell $TEVA in 24 the other day after not managing to break the 25 level for good and swop them to $JD stocks being up 3-4% today. Despite I think that $TEVA has a +30 potential, R/R is way better in $JD at the moment

787 2018-09-26 17:28:20 you missed the point, regurgitating old news / old releases is lazy reporting at best.  yes, accidental escapes may have an impact on wild stocks, from no impact to high impact. if the escapes are few,  impacts are few. Most wild declines across range are  NOT induced by aqua!
788 2018-09-26 17:28:17 This should be shown as an example to guys who value stocks by doing  historical cash flow analysis and building models based on them.
789 2018-09-26 17:27:50 (I am under the assumption this is a categories league) stocks are the hardest stats to accumulate and he is really really good at them where Ayton is not. also like JJJ’s passing upside. ayton will be really good at FG% and Rebounds and i think they are easier to acquire.

801 2018-09-26 17:21:55 @RustlersOnline Hi there. How come I can only find your breakfast baps in a co-op in Thame? No other supermarket I have been to stocks them. Many thanks
802 2018-09-26 17:21:51 Mr. Scott: traders typically like stocks that are currently hot. Being a short-term contrarian in the stock market is like looking for gold somewhere else; when people have already found it where you are standing. Sure: you may win big, but you'll probably be wasting time/energy-
803 2018-09-26 17:21:21 The market keeps changing. The churn is the Ultimate truth of the market. All you need to ask: Which are the stocks that started bullish run since July 16-20 and where do they stand now
804 2018-09-26 17:20:14 With cannabis stocks all the frenzy and its CBD alleged benefits, is there a future scenario where you see CBD infused products entered the sports world for health and recovery reasons?

821 2018-09-26 17:11:08 Stocks that put out constant news (unless they worked behind the scenes and were ready to unleash) can run quickly yes, and come down as quick. REAL Companies Take time!  That is why DD is so important

826 2018-09-26 17:07:54 I've watched and played you enough I think. Very combo heavy. Reliant on true follow ups. Incredibly low risk, almost to a fault. Leads to some struggling with finishing stocks.
827 2018-09-26 17:07:43 Bad argument. Try that around the world for different countries. It falls apart fast because different countries have different proportions of their private sector economy in stocks. It has never been a good timing tool. House of cards is a conclusion. (1/2)

837 2018-09-26 17:03:37 $ubx prob a buy purely b/c story is easy to grasp and most of biotech sector is too difficult for a lot of these analysts to follow (or they just don't care enough because they'll never suck in much retail on obscure indications). Anyway. Story stocks still bid up forever here.
838 2018-09-26 17:03:29 You should not advice penny stocks in the time of market downtrend ... because investor may think about you that you promote the company by getting commission in the back end... blue chip companies are chipped away in recent times..
839 2018-09-26 17:03:19 @KennyPolcari I hear analysts talk about the 3 day rule for buying stocks.    I think the new 3 day rule for the market  is that the market can not go down 3 days in a row.
840 2018-09-26 17:02:47 Don’t think of single stocks as much as how they fit together to accomplish your purpose. (2/2)
841 2018-09-26 17:01:36 Not deep enough. Sen Robertson's 2015 NV bill emasculated local government authority to regulate firearms. An ordinance as simple as controlling bump stocks is unable to be drafted thanks to that overreach.

850 2018-09-26 16:59:14 Wrong. This article tells us about the damage the at sea pens are causing to wild stocks. This damage is destructive. Escapes are many and recapture rates are extremely low. This is a problem! Saying industry is working on it is not good enough anymore.

856 2018-09-26 16:53:44 Mr. Young, you are sadly misinformed & ignorant of the facts about the aquaculture industry.  The demise of wild Atlantic salmon stocks globally are the result of human greed, poor fisheries policy, enforcement gaps, & in some small cases recovery is impeded by unintended escapes
857 2018-09-26 16:53:42 I used to know someone from there. She moaned about the cost of tinned tuna. The concept of stocks collapsing due to overfishing was new to her. I said ‘Don’t you ever read a newspaper?’
858 2018-09-26 16:53:40 Certain stocks are cheap for a reason, and trust me, it’s NOT because your fundamental analysis is better than the markets. Could be wrong here, just always leery of “undervalued” stocks.

869 2018-09-26 16:47:39 You can in a stocks and shares ISA I thought? Pensions are different though since you’re not really investing to own shares there, you’re investing to procure an annuity that would be better than just stuffing the money in a savings account.

885 2018-09-26 16:41:44 Let's add USD denominated assets.  Real estate, stocks, etc.  The surplus is coming into the US.  That's all that matters.  Trade is miniscule compared to this.   That why USD is supreme.
886 2018-09-26 16:41:37 Ok, well the ‘average American’ gets more pathetic every year. How about everyone with $2000 for parts and tools? Every American home owner? It just seems absurd to ban bump stocks when the weapon itself can be made at home. The bump stock can definitely be made at home as well.

892 2018-09-26 16:39:15 That is the conundrum. All stats and historical information points to worthy long term compounding results. But nothing is certain. So it still is a probabilities game. But it is a certainty that most will not meet long term goals if they do not invest in stocks.

897 2018-09-26 16:36:50 I guess the industry doesn't like the spotlight for the negative affects it has on our environment. Jobs is the only benefit from at sea aquaculture. The trade off is destroying wild stocks and taking jobs/money away from having wild stocks here. about 225$ million
898 2018-09-26 16:36:13 I do NOT get it, probably never will.   No "logical "  analysis of the mkt can come away with out seeing that stocks ( and other assets) are in a Massive bubble.  Sure one can argue that the mkt will continue to go up,  no problem ; but denying the existence of a Bubble?

907 2018-09-26 16:32:40 Notice the huge rally from the last time the dreaded death cross appeared?   Learn to know the difference.  Charts are only guides.  They fail.  Stocks act well.  Stocks act poorly.

911 2018-09-26 16:30:53 Giving huge tax breaks to rich so they can invest in their stocks and reward each other but not their employees, ruin relationships with the world at large, increase hate and violence against blacks and condone sexual assault against women? That is the Republican party agenda

932 2018-09-26 16:20:37 "The concentrated condition in the US equity market today is as amusing as it is disturbing. It's not every day that you see just two stocks account for nearly 30% of the total gains in the S&P 500, as has been the case so far this year with Amazon and Apple."
933 2018-09-26 16:20:24 Like taking them to last stock or 2 stocks most the time

939 2018-09-26 16:18:21 Bump stocks are crap, we should feel fortunate that this moron in Vegas used them. They waste ammo with inaccurate fire. Had this jackhole used a scoped rifle with a normal stock the death toll would have been in the hundreds.
940 2018-09-26 16:18:17 Markets steady ahead of the Fed statement. Mortgage Bonds, Treasuries and Stocks holding modest gains.
941 2018-09-26 16:18:02 Stocks modestly higher soon after the opening bell.
942 2018-09-26 16:17:40 That's because bump stocks don't kill people.

968 2018-09-26 16:07:09 In 1981 japan stocks market went down. A few months ago it retook the level from 1981. Good luck with using stocks market propped by money printing as store of value. banks are businesses. You one of those that really believe that blockchain can replace businesses

981 2018-09-26 16:03:56 It does, I mean.. AMZN is such a growth company that I don't think you can go wrong with it. As long as they keep expanding and keep re-investing their price targets will keep going up. Though sadly it too will be affected by bad political news as many other stocks will.
982 2018-09-26 16:03:19 Yes. I’ve heard that every day of the week since the election.

986 2018-09-26 16:03:04 You know what makes stocks rise? Not spending and new TV deals? You know what makes it drop TV execs not being pleased by ratings and pulling out or renegotiating deals. As much as you downplay rating it is very important to investors and TV execs. This is a bubble.

1033 2018-09-26 15:43:05 It is SEC's responsibility to stop scam stocks like "RFL" for Raphael Holdings Inc. This is a scam running for more than 6 months and despite all complains SEC has done nothing.

1153 2018-09-26 14:53:26 what are the odds out of 3 stocks that meet my criteria of a certain strategy, I pick the 1 that doesn't do what I'm expecting. sheesh.
1154 2018-09-26 14:53:18 I mean, you pretty much never see the Stocks of the world actually writing reasoned responses to the pro-trans metaphysics of the Astas, the Haslangers, and the Witts in academic philosophy. It's just inept flailing and asserting "NUH UH!" on the anti-trans side.

AAPL and MSFT are top of my preferred stocks so a bit excited when I found multiple patterns on various time frames and jumped early
1170 2018-09-26 14:48:22 Stocks higher this morning as the fed meets and will raise interest rates to 2.25% we expect 10 yr rates to continue to move higher in lockstep. We also expect the fed to keeep raising rates until they reach 3%. That’s when it get more dicey.
1171 2018-09-26 14:48:02 Stocks like $AAPL needs momentum. Such as when it was just under the 1 Trillion market cap, it was the easiest play in the world for higher and a squeeze.

1183 2018-09-26 14:44:29 I fear our uneducated friend means the stocks...
1184 2018-09-26 14:43:41 It is. Buybacks became legal in 1982 I believe. They were considered stocks manipulation before then. It’s basically systemic fraud. If we ever have a 1929 crash. CEOs will need armed guards constantly.

1186 2018-09-26 14:43:26 That's the point. Storing wealth (long-term) in government currency wasn't a thing even before Bitcoin. People store wealth as stocks, real estate, that sort of thing.

Having Bitcoin as yet another asset to store wealth in, is nice but hardly revolutionary.
1187 2018-09-26 14:42:32 Hello sagar, suggest me some stocks with huge potential  for long term pls
1188 2018-09-26 14:41:29 my only concern is market related-the Bears have been wrong, in anticipating that interest rates & inflation will hurt the market,    That's so far. Do not want to see risk-off in the market, when folks use stocks as an ATM.  VFFIF-no concern from an operational standpoint
1189 2018-09-26 14:41:20 @harrier214 Thanks for the follow. They're not all multi-baggers, but I do try. I do have several stocks that I follow BTW. Best, EXP

1196 2018-09-26 14:39:51 Good reason for most investors not to try and pick individual stocks (and most investment managers). Most, not all. If I own an index ETF or exposure to a broad market, I don't care what's making it go up.

Its ok to do nothing. I highly recommend it!! It will give you the confidence to go heavy when the stars align.
1465 2018-09-26 13:11:28 One example is Page industries ( jockey ) u can look at the share and also demand for that product . It wont end in future . It will grow either . Also look at mrf ( a person need 4 tyres for his car always ) and mrf stocks shows that .

1482 2018-09-26 13:04:52 Why not? Who says you are constrained to the only owning stocks IN the index you’re comparing performance against?
1483 2018-09-26 13:04:44 Right. Unless I read that wrong, it looks like the study concludes that if you buy the best stocks in each industry you tend to outperform. Water wet.

1487 2018-09-26 13:03:32 What about the non-quantitative things you learn from starting early? Such as patience, how to find stocks, and an investment philosophy. I think starting at an earlier age gives you a chance to learn and even fail when the monetary damage is smaller. What are your thought?

The BEST time to pick stocks - 

When MOST of the people around u don't even WANT to talk stocks! 

1503 2018-09-26 12:54:21 50% of the portfolio will be in 5 stocks - that investors can buy those on their own. They don't need Sygnia in between.

1527 2018-09-26 12:41:07 It is, lots of stocks dulling off fast, need to dry cure and chill quickly this year. Some nights of frost and cool days would help but the temperature is back up to 20 degrees.

1532 2018-09-26 12:39:05 There are definitely anomalies that have arisen due to indexing.  Examples are:

1650 2018-09-26 11:33:18 Apparently Mohammedans of Iranian/Turk/Arab stocks are more interested in their infrastructure development, investments, tech, and their 
native culture-aligned faith practices..
So @ecubatrip suggests Jihadism is run by IndoAfPak folk and has spread to all former BritColonies?

1653 2018-09-26 11:31:05 The Uranium based ETF sold out of 4 or 5 uranium stocks completely and then reduced their holdings in the others.  They sold off all their Lamaride shares exactly when we all knew it was the wrong time.  Who would not like a 70%+ gain in a few months?

This is what marijuana stocks have done:
Canopy stock up 2x; Tilray up 5x; Cronos up 2x over last 3 months
Please note Recreational marijuana is still illegal until Oct. 17
1660 2018-09-26 11:27:44 The craze over crypto is over. It’s trading more similar to traditional stocks now.

1668 2018-09-26 11:21:57 FMCG, IT and auto stocks were among the worst sectoral losers. The BSE IT index settled the day 1.60 per cent lower with TCS, HCL Tech and Wipro settling nearly 3 per cent lower.
1669 2018-09-26 11:21:19 The advance-decline ratio on BSE stood at 1:1, signalling a mixed trend in the stock market.

Midcap and smallcap stocks outperformed benchmark Sensex. The BSE Midcap index edged 0.42 higher while the BSE Smallcap index gained 0.12 per cent.

1672 2018-09-26 11:20:19 Well, vesting is best practice of course, but not law. 

Actually, the tokens (compared to stocks) already have more disclosure/transparency because those wallets are public addresses so the amounts can be followed. Wall St norms are mostly worse - yet no one hardly complains.
1673 2018-09-26 11:19:35 Honestly, I feel like some stocks trade better on different timeframes (very usually, bigger the stock, higher the timeframe).
For large caps, if I’m looking to nail an entry in the first 10 mins of the day, I use almost exclusively the 1min and revert to 5min after that

1683 2018-09-26 11:12:47 Councils, on the whole, are utterly incompetent. The culture around housing needs to change. A house must always be viewed as a home. A commercial property must always be viewed as a business. People need to STOP viewing property as an investment! Invest money in stocks & shares.

1896 2018-09-26 07:55:16 Morning. Is he doing them for the pub or his self. I’ve been doing all sorts replenishing my stocks. I’ll be making my Christmas cakes next month. X
1897 2018-09-26 07:55:07 Don’t forget the tainted blood stocks.
1898 2018-09-26 07:54:16 Very possible. A global financial crisis such like we have not seen before. What makes it worse is that I think the US financial sector is experiencing a bubble fueled by low interest rates. A lot of stocks are overvalued and its raising DOW and S&P indices. Very worrying!
1899 2018-09-26 07:53:47 sir I suffered big loss in DHFL on friday and my midcap and small cap stocks are also down heavily

2165 2018-09-26 04:13:05 But what has been done to prevent something like this from happening again? Bump stocks are still legal. People with mental health issues still have easy access to guns, in many cases. How many more people have to die before Congress actually does something of value?
2166 2018-09-26 04:12:46 Time to exit equity was in January just before the budget. Most of the small-mid cap stocks are down 30-50% from January highs. Doesn't make sense to exit so late.

2345 2018-09-26 01:53:06 Until you have $100k in the bank, "investing" is a waste of time.

Stocks, bonds, crypto, etc.

None have better returns than an actual business.

Instead, invest in your skillset.

Build a business.

Stack cash.

Then invest.

2394 2018-09-26 01:14:57 It seems like we jump from news story to news story.  Don't forget:

Bump stocks are still legal
Jim Jones is still a congressman 
Tax break for wealthy
Charlottesville 
Trump had 19 accusers
Steele dossier 
Obstruction of justice 
Trans ban
Muslim ban 

What did I miss?

2398 2018-09-26 01:12:53 Black people invest in stocks!!!!!!!!!!!!
2399 2018-09-26 01:10:53 “Come on. Your speaking to the third child of the demon king. It’s near impossible for me to get drunk!” Escanor quickly brings over two more. “You better not clear out my stocks like last time.”

Be careful of high dividend stocks. If the pedigree is good, no issues. 

Sometimes stocks crash & dividend yield jumps. In many such cases the business itself maybe going through a turmoil & the dividend may be unsustainable! 

In 2011 it happened in PSU banks.
2401 2018-09-26 01:09:45 GOD DAMN IT! I wanted it to fail. So it dropped in the stocks so I could buy it before it risen again.
2402 2018-09-26 01:09:03 I have sold all my stocks and am waiting for this meltdown....you know it is going to be a great one.
2403 2018-09-26 01:08:30 just admit that the reason private prison stocks saw a huge spike after your shitbird boss got implanted was bc you guys planned this whole thing well in advance. Kid napping poor kids so they can get fkn paid. Great guys! #bebest
2404 2018-09-26 01:07:43 $DBX We have on watch but never ceases to amaze me how some stocks like this get so much attention. I'm simply looking to make a profit.  :)
2405 2018-09-26 01:05:28 I need to buy hamburger meat so I can say I own stock  #stocks #classy
2406 2018-09-26 01:05:07 We went from being (in your mind) metaphorical laughing stocks to literal laughing stocks. Good job.

2416 2018-09-26 00:57:57 The international community just confirmed all we need to know by laughing at us at the UN-#Trump is our biggest national security and economic threat. Laughing stocks can’t be leaders.
2417 2018-09-26 00:56:35 I used to swing I lost my marbles holding stocks over night so crazy sometimes
2418 2018-09-26 00:54:19 I don’t trust those of you trashing and trolling stocks on twitter.

2421 2018-09-26 00:52:07 It's happened in our life time. Things were bad. When you keep funneling all of the Wealth to the very top- they don't spend most of it like we do. They have bought back their own stocks with their tax breaks (which makes the economy look good I. False misleading way)....
2422 2018-09-26 00:52:00 People need to get off of their hate brooms and look around at our changing America. It is better than the  America where there was no Manufacturing jobs, low employment, Stocks were low along with 401s, military was smaller than before WWII.
2423 2018-09-26 00:49:19 Except food lmao. Stocks come after food lol 
2424 2018-09-26 00:48:51 I'll invest in stocks before I buy shoes, clothes or whatever.

2433 2018-09-26 00:41:20 Stocks rise and fall. I quit wearing Nike long before Kaepernick. He is not a good qb. That's why he was  demoted. So stupid people try to know what you are saying.
2434 2018-09-26 00:40:24 Agree, this correction is an excellent opportunity for long term investment. We should not try to catch falling knife but should keep investing specially in quality stocks.
2435 2018-09-26 00:39:23 Sam, Is awesome ! I have been with Sam 10 or 11 months. No One else has ever come close to his success or GREATNESS. Really tells you every morning what stocks will do.  And he will tell you News Trumps all. But Sam is News DECIPHERING Prodigy .

2444 2018-09-26 00:29:58 Carl - believe it or not, it’s actually been a good contrarian indicator historically. High negative to positive pre-announcement ratio has been consistent with strong reporting season for stocks. FYI.
2445 2018-09-26 00:28:10 I bought gas with still half a tank left because gas is down 6 cents. and I'm going to invest money won from golfing into my stocks account. I'm doing adulting right I think?
2446 2018-09-26 00:27:05 Housing costs skyrocketed in the 80s after whopping Reagan tax cuts: where else should all that surplus money go but into assets (houses, stocks)?

2448 2018-09-26 00:26:10 #Diversification is not about the number of funds you own. It’s about the variety of asset class (like #stocks or bonds or other equities). Have you been encouraged to "diversify" your portfolio only to be sold more of the same? #Ottawa #WomensMoneyGroup

2467 2018-09-26 00:14:49 The set-ups I will trade are 1) the 5-minute, 10-minute or 15-minute ORB on stocks with fresh news and 2) 5-minute flag or pull back (ideally to a confluence of support/resistance levels and in line with the trend of the overall markets). ORB set-ups are less market dependent.
