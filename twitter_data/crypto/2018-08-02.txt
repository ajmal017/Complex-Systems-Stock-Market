HODL my crypto friends! Your patience will be greatly rewarded.

4 2018-08-02 23:59:00 Key challenge for commerce (and social interactions more generally) is creating trust mechanisms under the conditions of anonymity / pseudonymity. Another area where the dark net & the crypto-anarchists have something to teach us. Don’t ignore them - listen. #songetisummit
5 2018-08-02 23:58:56 I see a lot of fear as I scroll through my feed.  Remember this,
"Fortunes are built during the down market and collected in the up market."

7 2018-08-02 23:58:52 @HuobiGroup Yesterday, I sent XLM Crypto (Stellar) to my HUOBI Pro wallet
I never received my XLM
HUOBI to preserve my cryptos and claim a video chat by Skype.
Very disappointed HUOBI VERY bad help!
Attention, this wallet is not serious to feed your cryptos
8 2018-08-02 23:58:43 It wouldn’t take much to start a rally at these levels. I’ve helped onboard 6 new people this week to crypto that told me to ping them when it’s near bottom. I can only assume millions more are entering as well.

12 2018-08-02 23:58:22 Alors cette source? Ça fait bcp de sources a me filer a un moment, avec celle des propos sur les mœurs, non?
13 2018-08-02 23:58:20 What the fuck is this ?
The most tasteless thing ever?
14 2018-08-02 23:57:58 There's a reckoning due; I'm not sure I want to be around to see it. Just saw that million$ are invested in NSH real estate using crypto as collateral. Remember CDOs? RE securities consisting of cat shit? Nothing was learned from the 2008 crash but which markets to fuck up next.

17 2018-08-02 23:57:31 Apparemment dans ta tête oui vu que tu m’en parles dans une discussion qui n’a rien à voir avec la cité mais tout à voir avec les africains   non mais honnêtement tu te rends compte que c’est toi que ton argumentation accable?
