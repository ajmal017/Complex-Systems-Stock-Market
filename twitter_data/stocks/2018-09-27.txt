33 2018-09-27 23:43:26 The trimming is much more important when short and stock goes against you. When long, dropping stocks naturally trim position -> reduce risk. So, nothing to do but watch your money ( and risk ) disappear ... You can see why long only funds are less stressful to run.

36 2018-09-27 23:40:58 not even buying more stocks?
37 2018-09-27 23:40:56 BTW. SEC that is so diligently working to profit some short sellers in Tesla's case is the same agency that barred short selling in a number of stocks 10 year ago. How was it justified then and how is it justified now? This is the most illegitimate agency in its work ethics...

44 2018-09-27 23:33:53 I understand Capcom is a business. They will nip anything that they deem a threat right in the bud. I get it. I was only talking about *people* calling for his exile. People that don't have stocks in Capcom yet are trying to summon his ban as if they do
45 2018-09-27 23:33:21 I have the same posture, I own only AMD, AAPL and FB. EM are very volatile for my taste, I've been thinking in shorting some argentinean adrs, but I don't know what to do with Brazilian stocks, so I'd rather stay away from them.
46 2018-09-27 23:32:30 YO my parents just invested in pot stocks... if anyone knows my parents, you know how SHOOK TO THE ABSOLUTE CORE I am.... omg

48 2018-09-27 23:30:19 And how about that 20 dallar bill in your pocket? Is it really worth 20 dollars in gold, oh wait, no they stopped that decades ago, in fact if you look close it's a debt.... literally an iou. Or how about those oil stocks... they gonna send us a couple barrels of oil? Nope again
49 2018-09-27 23:30:05 All politics is local. NY recently passed a bill that bans bump stocks and AR15s. We could ban gun shows where ppl sell guns without any regulations. Most laws are passed at the state level before becoming national. So to think a State Rep will have no say is naive at best.
50 2018-09-27 23:29:43 Been thinking that but it may go up some more so I’d start with 20-30% of the volume and scale up the short until 83-85k. Wall Street is telling crazy things about investing in #EmergingMarkets stocks as a safe heaven to SPX so I’d be cautious. I’m all for SPX - long AMZN myself.

65 2018-09-27 23:20:01 prove it.  You cannot.  In fact, neither can she because everyone but her said it never happened.  Just like the DEMS just lied about leaking the story...tried to blame Dr. Ford.  The dems today were laughing stocks and embarrassments.
66 2018-09-27 23:19:41 By this SEC notice. I would imagine Binance is in a similar boat as it doesn't deal with US dollars or stocks crypto only. If some cryptocurrencies are found to be securities then yes,that will get very interesting for Binance. Glad I don't live in the USA when/if that goes down.
67 2018-09-27 23:19:32 You have the victim taking a poly graph test and wanting to speak with the FBI then you have the accused not taking the poly and not wanting to speak to the FBI..If I was being accused of a crime that I knew I was innocent of I would be taking a polygraph at the very least...

71 2018-09-27 23:17:23 My thoughts, 1Broker was used for trading securities - e.g. stocks - while 1Fox is purely BTC and BCH, one of which isn’t classified as a security and one of which nobody really cares about.

79 2018-09-27 23:12:02 Yeah, when you transact w/another investor (e.g. stocks), that's zero-sum. But if you're investing in something like a startup, it's not zero-sum if you're the only one that would fund it, but kind of zero-sum if others would fund it (b/c of the "lose out" aspect you mentioned).

91 2018-09-27 23:02:49 So this needs to be said: It’s super-dangerous to trade stocks bc of something you read on Twitter.  We  risk 24/7 as markets are fluid / dynamic. If something changes, and it will, our fiduciary is to our investors, not Twitter.  

This stream  ideas only and never advice.

2. People bragging about beating me

114 2018-09-27 22:51:07 people acting crazy about @1Brokercom  and #btc, saying binance is next. repeat after me.... Binance does not trade US stocks or other Currencies (forex).  you can't compare. Stay in school kids   $btc #crypto $eth $xrp
115 2018-09-27 22:50:30 theyre basically saying 1broker is illegally trading securities (stocks/derivatives) regardless what currency/asset they use to trade them
116 2018-09-27 22:50:29 Check out Dow Jones bar. Drinks are priced like stocks and increase when people buy them. There are also random market crashes where everyone rushes to the bar for cheap drinks
117 2018-09-27 22:49:45 He’s ran Late Model Stocks at Greenville Pickens
118 2018-09-27 22:49:39 binance nor bitmex trade US stocks or other countries currency. the only reason people are FUDing is bc you could fund 1broker account with btc.
119 2018-09-27 22:48:46 This refers to the trading of stock derivatives. Stocks which are securities. Crypto to crypto is different. BTC and other "currencies" are not securities. Nor is ETH so far as far as regulation goes. Lots of ICOs prolly are securities, but the deets of that still yet to play out
120 2018-09-27 22:48:18 Can you short on Robinhood or just purchase stocks?

124 2018-09-27 22:45:39 Licking their lips at the idea of investing low and selling high upon recovery? That's a basic investment principle. Anyone can do that, even with penny stocks. Please think before you next tweet and save yourself the embarrassment

139 2018-09-27 22:39:32 Why does having stocks have to be so confusing? 
140 2018-09-27 22:39:14 Didn't know Makro stocks it, but yaaaay
141 2018-09-27 22:38:05 GOP is tolerant of gang rape, police brutality, separating migrant children from their families, sexual assault, assault weapons (in the hands of law abiding citizens), bump stocks, KKK members, racists, war criminals, treason, global warming, voter fraud and Vladimir Putin.
142 2018-09-27 22:37:03 Investors must know well enough that if Elon goes, stocks will plummet. He won't go any time soon imo
143 2018-09-27 22:36:14 so not holding anything right now! lol. well certainely not Tesla stocks... lol
$QNC bro, stay ahead will ya.
144 2018-09-27 22:35:45 GOP is tolerant of gang rape, police brutality, separating migrant children from their families, sexual assault, assault weapons (in the hands of law abiding citizens), bump stocks, KKK members, racists, war criminals, treason, global warming, voter fraud and Vladimir Putin.
145 2018-09-27 22:35:26 Loving the podcast! I do object to the notion that somehow bonds are more accountable to simple math. Bonds and stocks alike represent claims to future cash flows. Bond claims might be narrower than stock claims, but these aren't any more grounded in math than stocks.
146 2018-09-27 22:34:46 plus Grain Stocks Report.....
147 2018-09-27 22:34:25 Hey here’s a thought after this #SEC #Telsa deal when the stocks in the dumper could or would Apple buy. It’s a computer not a car and self driving tech is here. It would be chump change for Apple. Maybe too much @tilray products for me?
148 2018-09-27 22:33:42 We need Saudi style Morals Police and stocks to make the New Age Puritans happy. Careful with your yearbook....
149 2018-09-27 22:33:39 They could also commandeer the double stocks of corporate booze that'll have been brought in for the fatcats and parasites of the @ScottishFA
150 2018-09-27 22:33:12 Bought TSLA stocks today then Elon gets sued by SEC and drops nearly 15%.... great
151 2018-09-27 22:32:46 im not against traders making some money off shorting stocks, but this cheering for a company to fail is completely un-American. people should be rooting for longterm success.
152 2018-09-27 22:32:42 11 breakouts: $SCHL (gap). One sub-$1, one $1-2. Low volume of opportunities but also low number of weak penny stocks. Net neutral.
153 2018-09-27 22:32:23 The only way I can see this happening is if Carlton trade picks 24 25 to someone who had a first round ( 2 for 1) they then trade that to Adelaide.
Are any of Carltons young Ruck stocks any good?

157 2018-09-27 22:28:49 Les gouvernements précédents ont laissé crever les Antillais pour permettre aux békés de finir leurs stocks de chlordekone. Et vous, en ce moment vous les laissez crever avec les sargasses. Donc arrêtez avec votre pseudo-indignation et votre fausse com d'écolo. 
158 2018-09-27 22:28:48 Obama's doing 

September historically worst month for stocks. 
But if you sat out the market this month, you missed a decent rally.
With trading for September set to end on Friday, the Dow is up nearly 600 points
159 2018-09-27 22:28:44 Second, the election rights and power. even in a company, there are many kinds of shares and shareholders. Shares divided into two different categories: elective or not. If stocks you hold haven’t vote rights. Congratulations you suffrage was useless.
160 2018-09-27 22:27:27 1Broker was offering trading of american stocks and securities without complying with AML laws and regulations. As they are the parent company of 1Fox, I would expect this action to also affect 1Fox
161 2018-09-27 22:25:54 Tesla stocks are down, but the damn tea stocks are up!!
162 2018-09-27 22:25:20 Precisely. Whereas household wealth and per capita ownership of stocks in the US at historic highs, except for 2000 depending on the metric you use.
163 2018-09-27 22:24:51 And yet if I were to clap them all in the stocks and throw rotten vegetables at their idiot faces, I would be labeled "wrong" and told "that's illegal." Where's the justice in that?
164 2018-09-27 22:23:58 Parnham took me to Costco for the first time today and I’ve never felt so anxious in my life  why’s it so big, there’s so much stuff, who the hell stocks the shelves 
165 2018-09-27 22:23:21 Yeah when they’re that far out they are pretty iliquid. But once the prices continues higher it’ll pop IMO.

I love finding cheap or oversold commodity stocks that have mispriced long dated options - and go long.
166 2018-09-27 22:23:18 Hopefully, Montana kept his financial position against $TSLA and gets the shit-tonne of fuck-you money he deserves.  After that, he gets out from under his boss's thumb and back discussing stocks with us plebes.
167 2018-09-27 22:23:15 Beige stodge is what I plan on eating the entire week  a miniature goat farm sounds AMAZING - pls post photos!
168 2018-09-27 22:23:03 Fair enough. I’m looking to enter trades on options of stocks like apple baba jd tsla fb
169 2018-09-27 22:22:59 Bet you won’t make Stocks disappear...

171 2018-09-27 22:21:33 Currently investing in beer and Coca Cola . Stocks about to be a hit 
172 2018-09-27 22:21:13 You already know I’ve been it buying shoes is like buying stocks
173 2018-09-27 22:20:38 The top 10% had an average Net worth of $5.34 million,  for the lower middle class, the figure was $44,700. The richest 10% own 84%of stocks. Americans richest 10% of households were nearly 120x's wealthier than the lower middle class.
174 2018-09-27 22:20:36 A + B do not always equal C. You're applying a level of complexity that simple analysis contradicts. China is clearly NOT feeling the pressure of the trade war whereas its stock market is. But they don't care as much coz so few own stocks in China. Not so for the US.

Regarding the Kavanaugh episode. What are we to make of the fact that stocks have continued strongly higher as the nation’s mounting feud over Trump’s legitimacy threatens to cross the line into bloody violence?

179 2018-09-27 22:19:42 I'm still at 2.5% weight on my two small puts AMZN and ABEA...but I lowered my load factor from 95% to 78% on single stocks. This week I sold my ETF Turkey which I bought in the final sell-off of August 18. I realize profit and profit and pr...At yearend the losses will lower tax
180 2018-09-27 22:19:37 Yeah man that sucks. Stocks are tricky.

188 2018-09-27 22:15:09 Of course we're buying $TSLA !!! What a gift at $266/share for a stock that is worth $4,000 - $6,000/share based on future market cap of $700 Billion over the next few years! 
#Tesla #stocks #investments #trading #profits
189 2018-09-27 22:14:58 So many r working hard 2 hurt TSLA that brought the glory of the automobile industry back to the USA. Shouldnt it b fraud only if he did this to sell stocks and make money? This is a CEO who is changing the world against all the odds.  with @elonmusk as a customer & shareholder.
190 2018-09-27 22:14:55 Burgess. You nailed that one all right. What stocks do you like? Because I’ll do the exact opposite.
191 2018-09-27 22:14:40 Bnf n stocks should be under pressure today. Fed rate hikes !
192 2018-09-27 22:14:27 stocks 
193 2018-09-27 22:11:51 No more will we worry about money/paying bills. No more will we

194 2018-09-27 22:10:43 Why can't 1broker be a dapp?  Isn't it essentially just a Bitcoin gambling site revolving around the price of stocks and commodities?
195 2018-09-27 22:10:13 Etsy or eBay would be my suggestion.  You can pick up unused Warsaw pact AK stocks pretty cheaply, for instance.  Used furniture or grips still in working shape are a little harder to find, though.
196 2018-09-27 22:10:03 Russia's wheat stocks are down on last year. As at 01/09, they amouted to 34 MMT vs 37.4 MMT last year. Just one month ago Russia's wheat stocks were nearly 2 MMT above last year.

201 2018-09-27 22:07:53 Ya u right. Twitter just should never be taken seriously, ever. Hahaha, also people shouldn't be so media-sensitive with their stocks. They're long term investments, one crazy news story isnt gonna kill a company but stock swings make it seem that way some times.

204 2018-09-27 22:05:35 What is fascinating with stocks like $TSLA, $VRX before that and others of that ilk is, why? Why are you long? You think it's misunderstood and might go higher? Who cares?! There are plenty of stocks like that. There is no need whatsoever to get involved with a ticking time bomb.

232 2018-09-27 21:52:18 @OTCMarkets You have got to be the most incompetent organization in the financial regulatory world. 7 to 10 days to look at 2 Annuals and a pair of quarterlies to upload it and you can't make that schedule? Meanwhile the shareholders get basically hosed because of you. Idiots.
233 2018-09-27 21:51:51 Some stocks to watch that are showing good upward momentum on the daily charts:
$RXII, $PTGX, $PACB, $IRDM, $BEL.
234 2018-09-27 21:51:10 Well if investors take this for what it’s worth without any concrete facts then I guess it’s going to be a lot of short term pressure on these stocks. When Canopy goes red, all the majors go red. So can’t wait for that

238 2018-09-27 21:49:43 Stop giving that sleazy Andrew left so much airtime. He’s got nothing to add as far as investment advice goes but just on to bash the stocks he’s short in
239 2018-09-27 21:49:32 Fund companies often don't hold stocks under SEC and DoJ investigation (and charges) even at large discounts, never mind at the incredible premium $TSLA trades at.

245 2018-09-27 21:45:23 Interest rates are not historically high. Today’s targeted fed funds rate equals the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation. meaning, real interest rates in the US are basically zero. The market outlook for stocks for now remains positive.

253 2018-09-27 21:42:44 We'll have to part ways on this one Louis. I don't believe China is concerned about their stock market in the slightest. Whereas the importance of the US stock market to Trump and US investors is beyond words. US stocks = 150% US GDP.
254 2018-09-27 21:41:54 1/ 
I think I am going to dump @acorns - here's why:

Unless you're a student, Acorns takes $1 per month. So over the course of a year that's $12 dollars. If you have $100 dollars in your account you will lose 12% of your money to fees. (stocks average 7% gains each year)

257 2018-09-27 21:39:40 1/? I mean, yeah they're both fairly right-leaning on a global scale, and that's a problem. But acting like both sides are the same is unproductive. HRC promised to end private prisons, and when it looked like she was gonna be elected private prison stocks tanked.
258 2018-09-27 21:38:23 These ppl are fucking clueless. 1) he is 100% guilty of what he’s being charged with 2) if he is forced to step down this thing will be cut in half overnight. Colt stocks don’t survive without their leader. Not to mention EVERYONE else has left the company, who will run it?!?!
259 2018-09-27 21:38:17 Traded through Greece ten times worse than this traded Trump and Brexit Nike ticks. Its just about not picking shite as the shite is really being highlighted last few weeks and in the main its stocks people have warned over for years. Time to go to cash producers and value stocks

263 2018-09-27 21:33:59 That is probably a good predictor for defense stocks. Bibi does set foreign policy for the Trump administration.

318 2018-09-27 21:11:37 I'm not a lawyer but $TSLA's counsel could cite many instances of media outlets sparking multi-billion dollar valuation swings in stocks on supposed M&A talks. The $TWTR buyout narrative from 2017 is a similar scenario where even a specific acquisition price was noted, @elonmusk.

369 2018-09-27 20:54:52 For people with money to make more money, that's it. Issuing stocks is literally done for the sole purpose of attracting capital, and investors want a return on the money they give you. Investors need a place to sell and trade said stock once it's issued; thus stock market.

372 2018-09-27 20:54:19 The side-effect is that it makes the company produce/worth more, so your stock/ownership of the company is worth more. And due to that, a whole economy has built up around abusing the system to just buy and sell stocks to make money instead of actually working. XP

408 2018-09-27 20:34:24 What happened to Tesla stocks?
409 2018-09-27 20:32:37 The top five stocks that closed lower today were $CAG, $CPB, $CXL, $SRCL, and $SJM.
410 2018-09-27 20:31:50 The top five stocks that closed higher today were $WCG, $REGN, $ALK, $NRG, and $INCY.
411 2018-09-27 20:30:59 Stocks are dropping lightening speed fast
412 2018-09-27 20:30:49 The top five most active stocks today were $AMD, $GE, $BAC, $F, and $AAPL.
413 2018-09-27 20:30:37 Seriously looking at getting money into "prepper" stocks 
414 2018-09-27 20:29:09 For me being new to stocks my shit is booomin
415 2018-09-27 20:28:42 One of the best stocks I have invested in
416 2018-09-27 20:28:39 Yes and I think someone still stocks Cherry B which was a big Babycham rival
417 2018-09-27 20:28:35 compren stocks
418 2018-09-27 20:28:25 Evening Market Wrap-up: stocks closed slightly higher giving up early gains amid political turmoil.
419 2018-09-27 20:28:22 I got stopped out with a anything less than a 40% stop on stocks. And for indexes (calls or puts) what triggers or indicators give confirmation to your entry?
420 2018-09-27 20:28:10 Checks Tesla stocks 
421 2018-09-27 20:28:03 lollllll elon musk just got sued by the FEC and Tesla stocks have dropped 7% karma's a bitch
422 2018-09-27 20:27:35 Speaking of laughing stocks: how about the US Senate. Seriously, this is not how professionals handle a matter such as this. The Senate has been irredeemably debased by this obscene spectacle.
423 2018-09-27 20:27:28 Rip Tesla stocks.
424 2018-09-27 20:26:56 @MerrynSW I read your article about investing in stocks is better than getting an income from a holiday rental. One point was that prices could drop in property, but is that not true of stocks too? Dividends you've said before will be squeezed due to pension liabilities.
425 2018-09-27 20:26:42 I dont think most of y'all understand this fraud case against Musk. You have to keep up with stocks to really understand how hilarious this is 
426 2018-09-27 20:23:59 Yeah many breakouts not seeing much follow through. Stocks and sectors are working here and there but it's getting thinner and thinner, judging by the sector ETFs. Particularly nasty moves in $XLF and $XLB. I shorted $SPY at the close.
427 2018-09-27 20:23:26 just from a straight beverage perspective, the #KavanaughHearings are a plus for #Coke, a minus for #Beer, and #NWNA is reporting out-of-stocks on 8-ouncers.
428 2018-09-27 20:23:16 Threaten to put them into the stocks if they don’t share? :-D
429 2018-09-27 20:22:28 Lately I have been told investing in $btc $eth $ltc $xlm or any #cryptocurrency will bring me heartache and pain. Then I remember 2008/9 when stocks brought me similar heartache and pain.
430 2018-09-27 20:22:22 My wife goes away and stocks up food for the dog but leaves nothing in the fridge for me! She then texts to check on dog but never asks about me
431 2018-09-27 20:22:10 @Phil1417 you’re allowed to speak aloud about stocks but you can’t tweet things that manipulate it. I wonder if he traded on it.
432 2018-09-27 20:22:05 I wonder how many people had shorted their Tesla stocks. They must have made a nice chunk of change on that drop. 
433 2018-09-27 20:20:34 It means sell your stocks and your car ASAP.

451 2018-09-27 20:13:48 Are beer stocks going up or down based on #KavanaughConfirmationHearing? Can’t help but to wonder which beer: @michelob @CoorsLight @Budweiser #Kavenaugh #DrChristineBlaseyFord
452 2018-09-27 20:13:25 Yahoo headline: "Stocks higher as traders glued to Kavanaugh hearings."

Wall Street must think K has acquitted himself well, unlike squish Republican "pundits."
453 2018-09-27 20:13:23 Im buying beer stocks tomorrow...
454 2018-09-27 20:13:22 I hated "bashers" when I started owning stocks. Pesky basturds didn't want me to make money! The market teaches us good manners or we suffer losses. Disagreeing without being disagreeable is something I keep trying to get better at, so I can benefit from others insights.
455 2018-09-27 20:13:12 When I get home I’ve gotta chart out a few stocks like $F and then repair my fieldnation profile xD
456 2018-09-27 20:12:52 $IGC looks like the $LBCC of the cannabis stocks... absolute dog shit company which means the shorts are piling in, and getting destroyed per usual. Glad I stayed away. Will end horribly, but definitely no reason can't go much higher now.

479 2018-09-27 20:06:02 It is important to stay objective! Many investors show their immaturity in managing a portfolio of stocks. I am thankful for those who have a different view of companies I own.
480 2018-09-27 20:05:07 "Pre-crash stock market periods show common patterns of excessive optimism, a widespread use of borrowed money to buy stocks, and an erosion of the fundamental foundation of the market."

485 2018-09-27 20:02:02 You know institutional investors have no CPI to worry about! Neither have the banks and ALM books. They have one idea to follow: less negative , zero or small positive is better than deep negative.  And retail? They don’t care either! They are long stocks!!! 
486 2018-09-27 20:00:54 FWIW, #stocks rose (modestly) this AM (during #ChristineBlaseyFord's testimony & questions) and began falling back at about 1 PM until starting a small comeback about 15 minutes ago.

2- Ive never owned PEN
3- I dont like how everything iheap for no reason. My stocks not looking pretty today. And, some good stocks well down for no reason. And it makes me think we entering Armageddon 
548 2018-09-27 19:35:11 I'm watching the stocks drop like crazy right at this moment.
549 2018-09-27 19:34:49 Just got off the phone with Dillon Dicks I’m investing into the stocks
550 2018-09-27 19:34:25 I so agree with you. He came out of the gate shouting. Not a good start for him
551 2018-09-27 19:34:08 But nothing to help reunit children and their parents. It’s better and more profitable to incarcerate and traffic. How are those private correctional stocks holding up? Making a killing, huh?

556 2018-09-27 19:32:08 Pat, the "Buy the Dip" video was very good.  Thank you for really breaking it down with the Maxlist stocks.  An area I still struggle with is where to put the stop.  On this set up, would the stop be the LOD?
557 2018-09-27 19:31:36 To anyone looking for a trading coach:

Ask/Request for their investing/trading records! There are way too many so called "Traders" that sell products for lots of $$$$ but can't make a dime trading stocks.

Thats why my record is public on my website!

563 2018-09-27 19:26:11 Mortgage Bonds are near unchanged weighed down by rising Stocks. Floating brand-new files is recommended. Shorter-term,locking is prudent.
564 2018-09-27 19:25:43 Because most people get more caught up in hype (stocks going straight up) versus making good, consistent profits. They won't admit it (or maybe just ignorant of the fact) but prefer good entertainment more than they do making profits. Takes work!

568 2018-09-27 19:22:21 Oct Expiry Option Writing -

1. Won't go for any naked Call writing since stocks already down too much.
2. Will try to do covered Call.
3. Won't be doing much Writing in 1st week .
4. Since Result season is coming & stocks can be volatile so overall wont take unnecessary risks.

630 2018-09-27 18:44:56 Also, the role of CEO itself directly reports to the chairman as the shareholders often need to symbolically simplify their stocks to one representative in charge.

By and large, the salary becomes the result of the corporate structure, but also the price of symbolic expectation.

Sea cucumber stocks in Washington fell dramatically during what Carson described as the fishery’s “gold rush” in the late 1980s and 1990s.

671 2018-09-27 18:26:58 I know and here is the big problem. Even if they enacted a bunch of laws it would take DECADES if ever to notice any differences of said laws. For example bump-stocks. millions r still in circulation and ppl r prolly making their own now. Its become a no win situation IMO.

700 2018-09-27 18:12:10 @_anujsinghal   is it advisable for channel to have technical analyst recommend stocks idea with less than 20% accuracy . I know all disclaimer that do it at your risk but is it not desired  to monitor  performance. Otherwise it is better to provide view as u provide every day
701 2018-09-27 18:12:08 At the end of the day when she asks how are your stocks doing 
702 2018-09-27 18:11:41 Add to this the counter to the idea that people can just invest in stocks to keep up with inflation. People shouldn't be forced into markets they don't understand just to preserve capital! Inflation is, in effect, a massive subsidy for Wall Street.

784 2018-09-27 17:41:09 You keep changing metrics. Dell is like a custom order, which is where Tesla is heading. They are in month #2 of matching orders to cars. If you matched Tesla's inventory turnover to say GM + its franchisees (inventory stocks), they're pretty close.

791 2018-09-27 17:37:36 Rent will increase with time in a monopoly system, true, but it competes with other financial assets for the use of cash such as stocks (dividends also increase with time), as such people usually only purchase a house when mortgage interest payments are similar to rent.

805 2018-09-27 17:30:19 For an alternative view read the excellent ‘Stocks on the Move’ by @clenow and the backtests with an index filter. Made a big difference on returns to avoid buying when the overall market is weak.

807 2018-09-27 17:29:08 Right now, the best way to get on board with defense stocks like those I’ve just mentioned is the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (BATS:ITA). It’s up 16% year-to-date and has tacked on 23.26% over the past 12 months.

817 2018-09-27 17:25:58 Obsulute truth. You can neither trade or be a investor for short term. Some stocks may soon get extinct. Half of India is stuck in Yes bank and NBFCs, with AAA ratings. If nifty does not sustain for next 3 days, get ready for all time low, as no fresh money will come. Gauranteed.

820 2018-09-27 17:22:22 ecause that’s where the big money is being made and will be made for decades to come, even if there is a correction or, worse, a recession.

Trade wars come and go.

So does inflation.

And earnings?… they’ll slow down, but they will not stop.

Take defense stocks, for example.

859 2018-09-27 17:05:49 GM & Tesla have similar liquidity ratios. However,Tesla is operating at a loss and GM is profiting. It's not reasonable as it'll cause massive fluctuation in stocks.Tesla relies heavily on investors' money to operate effectively,hence Tesla’s valuation could potentially decrease.

914 2018-09-27 16:40:38 Stocks are due a cyclical bear market until early 2020 or about 35% downside, but probably another decade to go UP in this secular bull market. A recession is likely later in 2019 or early 2020, but the prices may find a bottom by the time a recession becomes official...

922 2018-09-27 16:38:02 Some stocks are not going to appreciate in value significantly and pay out instead on dividend. i.e. if you own a share of this stock, you will get 30 cents every 3 months. Honestly, index funds will get you most of the way, as suggested previously.

954 2018-09-27 16:20:16 Sir, If you can spare a moment, Go to Valupickr, check who started/contributed the most on the thread on MRSS .

And maybe you can then track what are the other stocks to be avoided.

958 2018-09-27 16:17:47 Tilray (NYSE:TLRY) is rebounding again today, I caught part of the wave for +5% but could have gotten +10% if I hadn't mis-micro'd so much in the trading site's UI. Not even gaming today and my low APM is still messing with me

1007 2018-09-27 15:55:58 Interesting “drug.” I’m thinking that this approval has led to the recent run in cannabis stocks. It’s not sustainable- DEA even reclassified Epidiolex as schedule 1. Short cannabis, but watch GW if they can fill the war chest or expand indications (which I highly doubt)

1084 2018-09-27 15:21:53 Looks like window dressing towards the end of the quarter is saving the longs & squeezing the shorts. This is a great day to book your profits/get out of the stocks if you have any longs in your portfolio as I see the coming quarter not so favorable for the broad market $SPY $ES
1085 2018-09-27 15:21:10 It still bothers me how people are STILL in jail over weed and we now have weed stocks
1086 2018-09-27 15:20:56 Venus goes Retrograde October 5th ,  Venus is value - Retrograde often sees a change in trend for stocks and currencies - Oct 5-Oct 10 key .  I think low is on but willing to give XAU max 59 level if we do get one more down burst. I see positives lining up right now

1096 2018-09-27 15:16:17 I agree self-reflection is good. So is accountability and good judgment but let's be clear that rapists cause 100% of rapes which is what the chart implied.

If you own stocks and don't understand theyre devalued, then you should read up. Start with net present value

1108 2018-09-27 15:11:42 how much money do you invest to make these huge gains on stocks only going up like 60 cents O_O you must be investing like 100000 shares. Doesn't that scare you?
1109 2018-09-27 15:10:08 Stocks rise again-

Investors love tariffs
Investors love higher interest rates


1110 2018-09-27 15:09:48 I am so massively leveraged to the cyclical economy in my personal companies, I can’t justify owing stocks. I only use financial markets to offset negative volatility from economic cycles. Economy killed, my biz also. Besides cos go public to sell stock. Why the hell would I buy?
1111 2018-09-27 15:09:44 Yeah GILD 120, REGN 600, ALXN 200 lol.  Until we get a broad based overextending of the sector I think we will see it occur in a secular manner (ie crispr stocks)
1112 2018-09-27 15:09:19 My stocks aren’t moving right now. Apparently the world has stopped to watch everything unfold. #KavanaughHearings
1113 2018-09-27 15:09:18 I always look for confirmation from individual stocks... they have the final word regardless of any macro work or personal opinion.
1114 2018-09-27 15:08:58 I had my rims on & just put back on my stocks. You have a tire place ? Cause if not I know a good place to go to to get tires.

1118 2018-09-27 15:07:25 Stocks are trading in Positive Territory this morning after Fed's Announcement yesterday and amid US tensions with China.  MBS is currently down 6bps and Yields went up slightly to 3.07%.
1119 2018-09-27 15:07:00 I'm really enjoying the gun stocks people create. I'll still have my rift setup in the garage with the foam mats and overhead cable management, but this will be wonderful for demonstration and playing with friends.

1133 2018-09-27 15:02:08 Exactly! He addressed it head on and said exactly that minimal impact. I don't get why the stock continues to tank day after day. Please advise. Thank you

1136 2018-09-27 15:00:54 Again, we will let the averages and leaders tell us when to get in and get out. There is sometimes an extended lead time between the start of divergences and a primary top. Like turning around an oil tanker, it can take a while #stocks
1137 2018-09-27 15:00:45 When I offered I thought there’d be three entries. What was I thinking?! I don’t need to sleep for the next ten days though. Or be awake on holiday. So everything’s fiiiiine.

1142 2018-09-27 14:58:53 Non, mais les stocks sont limités !
1143 2018-09-27 14:58:33 Its real good. I put 10 on in and used that penny stocks app (set to $5 and 500,000 volume to ride some rockets) to shoot up to 50. Wish i had real human money to play with.
1144 2018-09-27 14:58:32 What I find a little bit concerning right now is that the number of stocks making new 52 highs minus the 52 week lows has turned negative, its not a short term issue but it might be the beginning of something larger.
1145 2018-09-27 14:58:24 2 books for £20, or either one for a tenner, while stocks last...
1146 2018-09-27 14:58:21 Definitely
1147 2018-09-27 14:58:13 In preparation for stock price decline, many investors make their portfolio combining stocks with bonds or savings. As I'm under stable employment situation now, I regard retirement pay as installment savings, and put all investable money in levaraged ETF.
1148 2018-09-27 14:58:13 The rise will not.  That is what I am after.  I could care less if U goes to $105 then to $90 and stays there for 4 years.  The stocks will go up with the price and then profit taking will bring them down.  Then they will bounce around.  That is for others and not me.

1166 2018-09-27 14:53:33 My opinion regarding networkers, I hate how they use the tagline "be your own boss" in a wrong way.  majority sa alam ko, ayoko yung way ng marketing nila.  Napaka false positivity . To be honest, if you really want to be "your-own-boss",  invest money to stocks.

1168 2018-09-27 14:52:48 misleading tone, the economy is not tanking as you make it sound. we are in a far better position than iran, argentina, turkey etc.. and all this is cyclical. in fact its a good time to buy cheap stocks or property.

1171 2018-09-27 14:52:11 I ve no idea wat it  means and so I looked at the one minute chart of $IWM by $SPY and makes sense. 
in WORDS : the majority of stocks isnt following the minority of stocks
1172 2018-09-27 14:52:01 I don't wanna mislead you b/c I'm not an expert on the economy but as I understand it you invest in something like the S&P 500 which owns a lot of stocks in every industry in the American market. You're investment is then spread around the companies their invested in
1173 2018-09-27 14:51:28 During bull markets, amateurs get conditioned to believe stops are foolish. After a bear market, those same people think investing is stocks is foolish. They blow up and quit.  A fool and his money eventually part ways.
1174 2018-09-27 14:50:52 He’s got stocks in the company
1175 2018-09-27 14:50:27 Energy stocks are poised for gains in the next few months. After that it's harder to tell
1176 2018-09-27 14:50:07 Yeah, for sure. I had $GST stocks I bought for 9¢ when they got delisted. They dropped all the way down to 2¢ per stock, but then they bounced back up to 10¢ when I finally sold. Definitely stay bc $NLST ain’t going anywhere!
1177 2018-09-27 14:50:00 Get the Robinhood app and trade without fees. They don't have any penny stocks, but some are pretty cheap so its easy to test the waters.
1178 2018-09-27 14:49:46 The valuation discount of $TRIL relative to other $FTSV CD47 plays seems ridiculous but Wall Street is always pushing the stocks they bank, while TTI-621 seems to be advancing in clinical trials.
1179 2018-09-27 14:49:41 Think the easy money & low cost money is done for now with Fed stepping up which were favorable for global stocks. Trump IRAN push adds a new dimension to the troubles.

1187 2018-09-27 14:47:32 My own assessment of the "market" always starts and ends with individual stocks. It doesn't matter if the indexes are strong. It's like going into a store because the lights are on and the doors are open, only to find nothing on the shelves. No buyable merchandise, no trading.
1188 2018-09-27 14:47:07 Is the ongari sale in stocks or 2nd production ?

1190 2018-09-27 14:46:19 Analyst reiteration = I already gave my irrelevant opinion, but since my paycheck depends on me pumping certain stocks, here’s my same irrelevant opinion, again.
1191 2018-09-27 14:46:10 opening all the power stocks like amazon ,apple options doubled , they were not even bothered by yesterday drop in market , it is performance chase by the institutions for weekend.  - it is big time for them for the month end.
1192 2018-09-27 14:46:04 It's a shame putting people in stocks in the public square has been outlawed. It's right up these asshole's alley.
1193 2018-09-27 14:43:52 yes. He's looking at the wrong stocks. I gave up on that guy a long time ago
1194 2018-09-27 14:43:40 I don't really have a price target, I'm just waiting for the chart and indicators to turn more bearish before I exit. I got in on Monday:) the daily chart looks nice too.
1195 2018-09-27 14:43:12 Well done, Dianne!
1196 2018-09-27 14:43:05 Yep.. With few stocks.

1199 2018-09-27 14:41:59 my take to explain it feels different this time vs 2000 is:
If you sum the total market cap of these stocks, divide by total market cap, 
the chart will look different.
1200 2018-09-27 14:41:52 On June 20th, I bought Apple stocks with hopes of making enough profit to buy the new Iphone. In the past 3 months, it has climbed by 20% and with the release of the new Iphone, it has climbed by 3%. I can now use some of those profits to buy an IPhone Xs. I currently own a 6s.

1703 2018-09-27 10:16:50 Yeah stocks were doing just fine until 2008 as well.

1952 2018-09-27 06:28:57 Bring back the stocks which also feature a sign saying what they did and place them in a city square.... or in the middle of the desert.
1953 2018-09-27 06:28:37 @TheWinnersCir As far as those highs on the stocks you mentioned they'll go up to those prices again.
1954 2018-09-27 06:26:41 @TheWinnersCir Stocks go up and down. As long as a stock doesn't delist and go to zero you have a shot.

2. One was more likely to buy average quality at higher prices than today than high quality at the higher prices

1985 2018-09-27 05:54:12  Auto stocks like Maruti & Eicher etc may continue to remain under pressure - likely to shed another 3-5%.

 Valuations still High 

Margins to remain under pressure due to rise of key input costs.

2079 2018-09-27 04:32:58 Join me on Statewide Drive radio @ABCNSW today at 4.45pm to discuss markets and stocks.
2080 2018-09-27 04:32:28 Then why does @LoblawsON have retail licenses in Newfoundland if they’re not interested in rec? Expect a dip in stocks tomorrow for all Ontario based LPs who banked on private retail who can now only have one store. That’s why announcement was made after market closed. 
2081 2018-09-27 04:32:26 ughhhh tignan ko mamaya pagbaba kung may stocks sila dito huhu. :'(
2082 2018-09-27 04:32:21 Stocks go up and down...if a stock goes up and you didn't buy...just congratulate those who bought and if a stock goes down...don't buy..simple...too much dramas
2083 2018-09-27 04:32:20 How much potential do pot stocks really have? We're live to answer your questions about the cannabis industry
2084 2018-09-27 04:30:09 Trump is doing a great job for All American Citizens! Booming economy, record low unemployment, highest 401Ks & stocks, more employed women, blacks, latinos, and asians, more job growth etc. MAGA!!
2085 2018-09-27 04:29:46 Convincing your family & friends not to invest in weed stocks is much harder when a significant portion of your assets are in Bitcoin... $TLRY $BTC
2086 2018-09-27 04:29:30 Me (smart): stocks up on milk when it's on sale. I have a whole fridge full of it lol suckers
2087 2018-09-27 04:28:19 My strategy has been to invest in things I regularly use in my daily life. Also diversify and invest in stocks that give a good a good dividend. When in doubt just follow @WarrenBuffett 
2088 2018-09-27 04:28:12 We regret to inform you, as of now the nylon bumper case is out of stock. However, we are constantly working towards bringing more and more stocks for our users.
2089 2018-09-27 04:26:25 Bubble bubble toil + trouble, fire burns & Wall Street Market Tumbles. The current market is running on low interest loans & corporations buying back their stocks to boost prices.  Greed may be good for stock brokers; but investor greed chasing $s is corrosive in the long term.
2090 2018-09-27 04:26:16 Love our President! Our economy is booming, stocks and 401Ks all time high, record low unemployment, high job growth, record high employed women, blacks, latinos, and asians, etc. Great Job President Trump!!

2094 2018-09-27 04:24:55 i think its because dow went down below its highs again, when it first went over its highs we were bullish af, lots of oil stocks 30%+up, we still have decent gapups tho. DOW is the last piece of puzzle to a bullish market imo, but its failing atm, looks like sp500 may fail too.

2108 2018-09-27 04:18:03 It doesn’t really matter, if he sounds stupid , or he talks foolish things. The important thing is the performance. American economy under D. Trump is booming. The unemployment is record low. The stocks are record high. America is no more Obama’s ‘talk good act nothing’ America.

2112 2018-09-27 04:14:45 Forager Funds are all over buying distressed falling stocks caused by overreactions to negative news.. The fact that they have not added to their position in $FIG during this carnage is enough alone for me to say not interested.
2113 2018-09-27 04:14:43 Amar raja also looks good.

2114 2018-09-27 04:13:43 stocks rise by 1%.
2115 2018-09-27 04:13:02 Equity security tokens make the idea of “Hedge Funds For Private Stocks” a reality. For this, expertise from VC (pick winners), data science (track activities & predict value), & quantitative investing (trade liquid assets) are needed to generate competitive returns.
2116 2018-09-27 04:12:48 M&M looking good at this level ...Though all auto stocks trading near below their imp level...Mahindra still holding its imp levels ....CMP:- 888 , SL 870 Hourly Clbs ...Target:- 920-930 #M&M
2117 2018-09-27 04:12:38 To be clear I'm not saying to marry this stock and never invest in cannabis stocks. I'm saying atm it's a good play vs. Overvalued (some are undervalued) cannabis plays. Gonna be some corrections after legalization fomo stops and revenues become the catalyst.
2118 2018-09-27 04:12:20 Keep Apollo tyres in your radar ... It may blast at any time.... Govt has put 10% import duty on radial tyres....it is a positive for all tyre stocks.... Just 2 days back I suggested Apollo tyres at 224 levels now trading at 234 levels 
2119 2018-09-27 04:12:12 See.. I admire @bud006's ability to be civil while arguing a point but I'm the kind of guy to tell Jon that he needs to quit writing & sell penny stocks from his mom's basement.
2120 2018-09-27 04:10:53 rupee is appreciating....can IT stocks witness some profit booking further?
2121 2018-09-27 04:10:34 Stocks are simply research nobody is going to give you information without you paying for it just Google the s*** you are smarter than they are by having Google at your hands
2122 2018-09-27 04:10:19 Still want that chance to buy some stocks. Really think this will be the biggest augmented reality device ever.
2123 2018-09-27 04:09:56 Keep holding our stocks Sarda, Polyplex, gulshan polyols, Banco and others.. Nothing to worry all these stocks are bought at reasonable to cheap prices, we wait for markets to turn.. #nse

2127 2018-09-27 04:07:19 Recommended Ruleset, section 1.6, Pausing, ends with: "If the pause causes the opponent to lose a stock, the player who pauses forfeits 2 stocks."

I'd rule the game in the favor of the person paused on. Also, as the person getting paused on, I'd advise failing to recover.
2128 2018-09-27 04:05:47 Big no. I never buy dips. Buying rising stocks & avoid buying cheap & falling stocks.

2151 2018-09-27 03:47:55 So what's the best stocks to invest in? Or which stocks did U accumulated or invested at this downfall moment?
2152 2018-09-27 03:47:53 $CEI Does anyone knows or provides a service on hoe to track and spot these penny stocks in break out mode?
2153 2018-09-27 03:46:19 Primary tops normally occur when there is nary a cloud in the sky, that is the news is good. Headlines about how great the economy and corporate earnings are should b ignored. They will not help u with mkt timing #stocks
2154 2018-09-27 03:46:09 Stock markets artificially inflated bc corporations using their tax cuts to buy back their stocks. My company just let go almost 300 people. Wells Fargo let go over 600 a week or so ago. Everything costs more. First round of welfare to farmers just happened. None of this is good.

2162 2018-09-27 03:34:57 Jackals are strict no.

2200 2018-09-27 03:06:14 I sometimes wish putting ppl in stocks were still a thing - but only women (unless they voted Trump) get to decide who goes in. This principle would get my vote for a full 24 hrs.

2204 2018-09-27 03:04:04 For the most part, people are into crypto because they are aware of the debt spiral. Even the general public realizes deep down that the 8 year bull market in stocks is unsustainable. I bet the lungfish didn't know about land until the sea got toxic.

2219 2018-09-27 02:53:50 Ahem ... that’s because real wages haven’t kept up with profits or productivity gains and the tax cut only benefits the top 1% or foreigners who own our stocks, so middle and lower income class Americans are taking 2 jobs.

2222 2018-09-27 02:53:23 Saurabh ji, there is a difference. For Americans, Trump is doing good for jobs, stocks, currency, immigration. His voters are not Chinese or Indians, so he doesn’t care about them. Modi on other hand is all speeches and blame game.

2236 2018-09-27 02:41:01 The US represents half of global equities. US earnings are at all-time highs. Earnings per share growth set a 10-year high at 27% YoY on Q1. A record 80% of companies beat expectations this year. Hence why stocks have largely ignored the Fed hikes and the China trade wars.

2282 2018-09-27 02:10:07 Asian stocks edged lower at the open Thursday as investors assessed  commentary from the Federal Reserve that reaffirmed the U.S. economy is  strong enough to warrant another interest-rate increase by the end of  this year.

2328 2018-09-27 01:39:09 i love hearing abt things i’m actually interested in and curious abt, i just had an hour long discussion abt investment and stocks with my dad and i was actually so intrigued and mind blown with how money works
2329 2018-09-27 01:36:26 Not just that I got informed my stocks are up to 5 grand now!!!! Beyond blessed!
2330 2018-09-27 01:34:18 Does anyone have good articles for using tweets with sentiment analysis of stocks. Looking more for the machine learning techniques used in NLP for this type of task. I know how to get the tweets. #MachineLearning #NLP #Tweepy #Python #code
2331 2018-09-27 01:31:55 I think it was your idea.. take credit even if it wasn’t .. I only track about 20 stocks now with detail.. a few others on the fringes. And..I wait to trades to come to me. My trading life changed drastically..

2336 2018-09-27 01:29:02 Commentators are always so clueless as to whether I’m Stanky or SK during doubles, but bet your fucking ass the one time they’re NOT its when I lose 4 stocks in 1 minute to rests... great job guys, no really GREAT JOB
2337 2018-09-27 01:28:52 Normally I'd say Stocks =/= Economy but this long-term decline suggests that confidence in the economy has taken a beating
2338 2018-09-27 01:28:12 You have no idea Mark, the old purchase tax deal was a nightmare, people ended up paying tax on stocks, it was crippling in many businesses, VAT was a brilliant concept, pushes the tax to final consumption.
2339 2018-09-27 01:27:22 Meet me in battlefield / 3 stocks / no items. You too @uburdub and you @yakzdubz and you @NotSweetTooth. Everyone getting this ass whoopin. Who ya'll maining?
2340 2018-09-27 01:26:34 Very limited stocks that are available to trade.  Sketchy payout system and extremely poor communications.
2341 2018-09-27 01:25:52 PE is closer to 30 but I get it. Battleground stocks are scary
2342 2018-09-27 01:24:38 Most Americans are not ready to sell their soul for the almighty dollar.  Only people with the right stocks and those making over$400,000 are benefitting heavily from Trump.  The rest of us are paying for all the tax cuts or marginally benefitting. #VoteBlue
2343 2018-09-27 01:23:54 $SPY Seems the word today was that the market was bearish? Still seems to be about select stocks to me $NFLX $ROKU $DLTH $GOOS $JDST $EB etc

2348 2018-09-27 01:19:03 love your stuff!

question though!  sounds like you've got some education.  have you given away any money made since 11/9/16 from any stocks, bonds, money markets, 401k accts?

if not SHAME ON YOU HYPOCRITE!  THAT'S ALL TRUMP CASH THAT YOU'RE HOARDING!

2350 2018-09-27 01:18:11 That last sentence resonates with me. I’ve had stocks or even games where I actually could not play the game. It sucks being combo food with no landing/ledge options. It helps that I actually have fun with Cloud with him being good, but it sucked being a solo main for so long

2356 2018-09-27 01:12:39 US stocks closed lower as investors reassess a potential end to the Fed's 'accommodative' monetary policy. Overnight lending rate increased by 25 bps to 2.25%, in line with expectations. #morninghuddle
2357 2018-09-27 01:12:13 I agree should not be a sell on news since now they will be able to make even more money now that they are legal...IMHO
2358 2018-09-27 01:09:57 The lesser your holding period and more the number of stocks you own, you need to come out with new ideas almost every other month. Difficult to get good ideas with such a frequency. Better to hold fewer companies for long term.
2359 2018-09-27 01:09:30 To be technical the term I should’ve used was investment strategy or vehicle.  UnderPerformance or OutPerformance would need some additional definition.  Like vs historical Avgs?  More likely UP over sterm and less likely over lterm.  1990s/2000s bonds/stocks both did quite well.

2368 2018-09-27 01:02:49 When Brexiteers are eventually held to account for their duplicitous behaviour, may I suggest they be placed in stocks and pelted with rotten veg & eggs (assuming a shortage hasn't led to rationing). I'm sure they'd appreciate good old fashioned customs being maintained.

2371 2018-09-27 01:01:09 It truly depends.  Retirees with large pensions and high SS benefits have a large “fixed income position” so a higher weighting to stocks may make sense, especially if they are not tapping these assets for 10 years.
2372 2018-09-27 01:00:16 The #FOMC delivered a 0.25% #ratehike as expected by the markets. #US #stocks and the #USD fell but bond prices rose. The overnight market action could be the result of a portfolio rebalancing given that the rate hike decision was likely priced in before it happened.
2373 2018-09-27 01:00:09 Jeff you are good guy probably because you are a regular guy. Not that it matters, but I kind of like you. But your gold input requires a better chartist.

Indeed gold is not interesting unless SOMEONE knows EXACTLY when to pull the trigger.

Stocks/Bonds with Jeff=I perk up.
2374 2018-09-27 00:59:10 Oh, sorry, we would like to get rid of bump stocks, and make the magazines in military weapons smaller, say 5 shells per magazine. Why do you need a 20 or 30 round magazine, to kill Godzilla maybe but not for hunting or even range shooting, take clip out put new one in.
2375 2018-09-27 00:59:00 Good idea sir ! All bank stocks will move up today ! Hope you have no vested interest  otherwise you know SEBI is always watching Market movers

2402 2018-09-27 00:44:41 I guess this is just a broader indicator of the multiple hindenburg omens firing off for weeks. 52% of stocks below their 100DMA with indexes within a few % of ATH, and $SPX still 5% above it's own 125DMA... weird

2408 2018-09-27 00:39:07 I buy stocks like $JAN because they are good value. Because they are also loss making they have to raise expensive equity. Perhaps I am wrong in thinking they are good value.
2409 2018-09-27 00:35:35 Is $TRUL better than $TLRY? $TLRY has been doing crazy well for  stocks but I know $TRUL experienced almost 900% Q growth and holds the most revenue of all the  stocks on the market.

2412 2018-09-27 00:32:18 If we still have stocks, we will! 
2413 2018-09-27 00:31:21 Isn’t this like comparing apples to oranges though?  Fidelity keeps custody of your assets if you have stocks with them. Anyone with a reasonably high net worth in crypto is probably holding their funds in their own wallet, not relying on coinbase as their custodian.
2414 2018-09-27 00:31:07 Yeah. Canadian stocks. With legalization coming the stocks are all over.

2423 2018-09-27 00:21:38 I am thinking to buy some car rental company stocks. The more lemons they sell, the more demands for rental cars.
2424 2018-09-27 00:21:21 He gets that all important A rating from NRA, and some bucks to boot! No ban on bump stocks though...
2425 2018-09-27 00:19:27 Yep companies are buying their own stocks back at record lvls falsely inflating their cost. CEO pay is 350% more than the average employee. & the shrinking mid class is actually making less cause of inflation & rising prices thanks to your tariffs. & the world laughs at us.

2436 2018-09-27 00:08:59 Makes sense. I use Topix 500 + Small as an investment universe to pick single stocks from, while Nikkei is the futures contact for short term hedging / placeholder. I don't track day to day moves, but would look at that 6mo divergence in terms of factors (size, value, etc)
2437 2018-09-27 00:08:29 Banning bump stocks does nothing. A shooter can accomplish the same firing rate with a rubber band and enough practice
2438 2018-09-27 00:07:49 More so I'm saying that banning bump stocks or not is an inane distraction that is given priority over real solutions - requiring real arguments - that were not having due to politics and lack of pertinent knowledge from the left and right.
2439 2018-09-27 00:07:40 Short term stock market sugar high. Corps used $ to buy back stocks. Soon it will wear off & earnings will miss, cost of tariffs will kick in, & in April the gutting of SALT deduction will hit home for us. But at that point the ‘looney left’ will be in charge so you’ll blame them
2440 2018-09-27 00:07:17 Oh man so true. Although, when realized vol is lower, selling puts on uptrending stocks (w/a reasonable Skew)can remove a lot of that frustration.
2441 2018-09-27 00:06:40 Sure, but they dont have to. Its not like Zain is Armada or Leff and would take like 6+ stocks if they arent counterpicked
