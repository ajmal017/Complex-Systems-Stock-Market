3 2018-03-22 23:27:51 We are talking principally about multi-nationals that gut the nation of its commodities and pay bugger all royalties and tax. Reducing company tax increases profit...but that does not translate to jobs and growth. Otherwise banks would be stacked to the rafters with new employees

8 2018-03-22 22:46:17 @realDonaldTrump is on his way to bankrupting every Working American by raising the prices of commodities with his trade war. Wallmart is stocked with Chinese made goods. Trump and his wealthy friends buy European goods so no tarrifs on those! #Impeach #tariffs #TradeWar

98 2018-03-22 18:22:59 120 million people are victims of high value!!
Prices of some essential commodities, including rice, have risen in 2017. Despite the increase in the per capita income in the country last year, it has not received any benefit of 12 million people of low and middle income!
99 2018-03-22 18:18:00 there is no leadership, is all a Global movement, going after all countries to take over the commodities, energy, water, air, you name it, they want it all, they have planed this for years, and Killary was the ticket, that was going to seal the deal, but didn't happen.
100 2018-03-22 18:16:17 The market is acting like industrial commodities will get whacked by deflation or tariffs.  It doesn't matter why.  The price matters.

102 2018-03-22 18:09:33 No - it's time we pass the ERA. It's much harder to treat women as commodities when they are EQUAL human beings under the constitution. Support the ERA. Equality first. Everything else will get better. @EqualMeansEqual #MeToo #TimesUp

124 2018-03-22 17:11:11 Error, los commodities han mantenido su precio a lo largo del tiempo con las variaciones propias del mercado. Ver el caso del cacao. Una de las soluciones es la integración vertical y horizontal, pero el ecuatoriano es muy poco asociativo por naturaleza.

126 2018-03-22 17:08:16 Y lo de ser la principal fuente de divisas no petroleras no es una gran virtud pues se basa no en la competitividad del sector sino en la falta de otros rubros de exportación. Si no es petróleo o commodities agrícolas, qué exporta el Ecuador?
127 2018-03-22 17:05:05 Lo que sí le he de reconocer es que los negocios agrícolas están destinados a ser poco rentables si no se integran verticalmente con los otros eslabones de la cadena. El precio internacional de commodities agrícolas tiende y tenderá a estancarse o bajar.

155 2018-03-22 15:12:13 No estoy de acuerdo. Los productos ecuatorianos se destacan en nichos del exterior, pero no consiguen un reconocimiento generalizado (porque la mayoría son commodities precisamente), y no hay tal estabilidad: la producción es precaria y lo precios muy variables.
156 2018-03-22 15:10:29 Consumerism has really become part of the fandom now. You have cookie cutter adopts. Companies buying major furry sites (FA) and people cranking out fursuit parts as commodities. Sharing art online?  Yeah. I've seen copyright battles already, closed species and the like.

166 2018-03-22 14:39:09 maybe more developed economies with less emphasis on agriculture and commodities and more on services is less prone to frequent and deep recessions. no need to involve Fed.
167 2018-03-22 14:31:18 A „wake-up“ call is indeed needed. But one which unites the world beyond banning the trade in ivory or other wildlife “products”. One which opens our eyes to the beauty of all creatures and recognizes their right to live on this planet as individuals, not commodities.

222 2018-03-22 11:05:08 Perhaps the very issue is that we look at forest and water in isolation, as two separate commodities. We had #IntlForestDay yesterday and #WorldWaterDay today.

238 2018-03-22 09:46:08 When a nation is over-reliant on one or two commodities like oil or precious minerals, corrupt government ministers and their dodgy associates hoard profits and taxes instead of properly allocating them to schools and hospitals.
239 2018-03-22 09:45:14 #wti #oil  As the tariff war starts, some economist believe that commodities and markets may correct by 40%.  Probably depends on the depth of the tariffs themselves.
240 2018-03-22 09:39:42 Well the transcult think children are commodities.

245 2018-03-22 09:09:09 Africa’s vulnerabilities and limited participation in global trade are indicative of its traditional reliance on the export of raw commodities and the import of value-added products. #FreeTradeArea
246 2018-03-22 09:05:55 Is it good to remove tax from commodities just because they are necessary to a social group. Many products are necessary to many groups but we can’t afford to remove tax from all of them, right?

248 2018-03-22 08:54:01 Job creation and industrial output at epic low levels under PM Modi! Cost of commodities increased due to unreasonable rise in diesel prices which is now regulated daily and hence doesn't make the news that often! Failure!
249 2018-03-22 08:51:16 Brazil sugar is not sold by Brazilians in Africa. It's sold by Africans, who can as well sell coffee, etc. And, check, the most traded commodities across borders. You'll be surprised. #Rugyeyo shouldn't accept defeat as the default. Let's learn from Africa's pastoralists...

295 2018-03-22 01:55:47 Yet they have tariffs, on everything we sell, commodities, cars , and manufactured goods. If we weren't competitive why would they need them?
296 2018-03-22 01:08:46 I couldn't disagree more. Top draft picks are valued commodities and are paid as such with a bonus that is independent of their salaries. With 50+ rounds of the draft, most of the players drafted aren't getting big time $ which is the same for international signings.
