2 2018-10-18 23:53:19 We don’t waste our time on public commodities 
3 2018-10-18 23:35:01 Ok, I think there could b the good suggestions- 36 is not good, I know. But I’ll go for my plan firstly, u know it’s a tricky balance from markets to commodities. @VP @usairforce @EPN @dilmabr @Pontifex @JanetYellenBlog @alangreenspn @stevenmnuchin1 @Citi @jpmorgan @Naikakukanbo
4 2018-10-18 23:11:12 Never thought my tuna sandwich was part of the commodities market.  Why can’t people just play fair?  Tuna is a vital item during emergencies and natural disasters. Serving as a protein source of canned food that needs no heating.
5 2018-10-18 22:53:53 So Mexican commodities are OK to cross back-and-forth across the border but people have less value?
6 2018-10-18 22:50:47 Everything is normal wani, we have fuel, basic commodities, forex and investors lining up.

11 2018-10-18 22:42:47 When will @CITES STOP considering wild, non-humans as commodities ? These non-humans are sentient, emotional BEINGS....they are not things, to trade and turn into trinkets!!
12 2018-10-18 22:42:24 Hey dim bulb if you close the border you will halt the millions of dollars in produce and commodities that cross every hour of every day between Mexico and the U.S. Stop tweeting  dumb-a** responses to problems your administration has made worst.
13 2018-10-18 22:22:28 That’s even more true when cross asset correlation is as high as now and rarely it drops during macro risk off times... “The benefit of diversification”... long Gold/Commodities?
14 2018-10-18 22:15:38 It's always about short-term profits for the 1%, even if it involves the machinery of death (be it weaponry or climate-destroying commodities).  Zero regard for human survival.
15 2018-10-18 21:55:10 Friendly reminder. 

$BTC originally created after the last credit crisis and people losing faith in the monetary & banking system we’ve got. 

Current situation: on the edge of a stockmarket crash & new credit crisis due to high debts. 

$BTC will be a hedge, so are commodities.
16 2018-10-18 21:51:47 they produce 70% of the contamination, but if they also produce 90% of the food, electricity, housing, processors, education, etc. then it means that we should eliminate the other companies that are producing 30% contamination but only 10% of commodities. Not enough data.
17 2018-10-18 21:51:18 Finalmente o Brasil vai sair dos commodities e produzir o produto final. Nosso verdadeiro ouro branco
18 2018-10-18 21:48:39 It’s coming faster than you think. 

Catalyst: stock markets crash. People hedging in $BTC and commodities.

Nicely lining up with new upgrades on $BTC, altcoins finishing products, ETF’s, Bakkt platform & CTF’s and futures on the rest. 

Shit is gonna explode.

$BTC
