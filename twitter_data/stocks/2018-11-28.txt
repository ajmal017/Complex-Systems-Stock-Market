48 2018-11-28 23:44:30 Global equity market rotation has persisted since it began in October. High-yielding sectors, such as real estate, telecoms and utilities, outperformed as tech suffered more losses. Low volatility consumer stocks held up while the momentum factor suffered more declines.
49 2018-11-28 23:44:25 The government (thanks BHO) did not want to strain GM’s resources with too many loans with the bailout. Instead, they accepted shares of stock. However, the shares never regained the value at which we acquired them. When government finally sold the stocks, America lost about $11B
50 2018-11-28 23:44:14 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses
51 2018-11-28 23:43:24 Stocks move erratically sometimes almost based on nothing. It's all based on investor perceptions which sometimes can be ridiculous.
52 2018-11-28 23:42:39 Idk if that correlates to stock prices. Nintendo stocks were dropping a few months back despite the amount of success they were having. There has to be more to it
53 2018-11-28 23:42:12 Never know CCI can be used in stocks. This looks very interesting. DMART is a fundamental buy in my portfolio.
54 2018-11-28 23:41:41 @msexcel I downloaded the newest update. For some reason, the new Stocks feature isn't working for me though, even though I'm replicating the tutorial video. I keep getting the error "Cannot convert to Data Type"
55 2018-11-28 23:40:41 Oil production and stocks went higher DESPITE his actions. Stock market went up due to ZIRP, QE and other stimulus. Cheap money & heavy debt loads will have devastating consequences long term - well after barry is out of office so he can take the credit & none of the blame.
56 2018-11-28 23:40:38 @cnn One of the best Hume ppl are slaves to their passions examples I have seen is Silicon Valley made it big on stocks, owed taxes, then stocks fell too low to even pay the tax bill itself. Simply changed the laws, all was well.

62 2018-11-28 23:38:54 Amazon took away the ability for workers to invest in their stocks and still have their employees pissing in bottles. So maybe not a great place to comment when the OP is about destroying the establishment.

64 2018-11-28 23:36:58 IMHO: “Go long on popcorn stocks” wraps this up so beautifully that I’d go with that quote.
65 2018-11-28 23:36:16 I’m sure they will after proper consultations are completed with industry. Opposition parties have the luxury of throwing whatever they want to the wall to see what stocks whenever they want without consequence.

67 2018-11-28 23:35:29 Maybe somebody could explain to him simply boom+bust cycles. Bubbles happen and the clever ones make money. Doesn’t mean the underlying asset is broken. How about the people who bought stocks 2008  pre crash? Also bitcoin supply is limited, fiat supply seems to be unlimited.

69 2018-11-28 23:35:12 You've elected a leader who is almost 80 years old.  She has no credibility to inspect the finances of a political rival until her own stocks are divested and she will drive centrist voters to the right.

73 2018-11-28 23:30:21 Walmary stopped selling the AR-15 and other rifles in 2015 and only sells handguns in Alaska.

The retailer does not sell gun accessories like bump stocks or high-capacity magazines. Do they have lettuce restrictions? Or only sell shredded lettuce in Ca? No so this is asinine.
74 2018-11-28 23:29:22 I remember reading at a recent Munger meeting someone asked about his huge drawdown in the mid 70s (when probably using leverage and was only in 3 stocks), and he said something to the effect that it will happen to you, and if it doesn't happen, then you didn't push hard enough.
75 2018-11-28 23:28:12 1. The single market allows drug companies across the Eu to rapidly shift stocks, This allows not only for higher profits through differential deals but also a fantastic hedge against currency movements. Within the customs union this continues. So....

77 2018-11-28 23:27:12 Need the stocks to go up a lot more ASAP so I can sell some because I WANT that new APOLLO XI 50th anniversary Omega watch 
78 2018-11-28 23:26:19 The positive TICK reading today was the largest since February 9 and ranks 10th among
all days since 1990.

In the short-term, many of these large TICKs were near points of buying exhaustion, and stocks settled back for a week or two.
In the medium/long-term, it was a good sign.
79 2018-11-28 23:26:03 @ASXTreasurehunt the biggest pump and dumper of them all who's the target near and small. He buys them low and pumps them high and dumps right into you and I.
Loved by many but what for? For dumping stocks down to the floor. When he's in you know, and out you go. Brokers love him
80 2018-11-28 23:24:10 Also, for the record, I didn't earn $230K through settlements; it was nearly $750K, and about a seventh of it has been invested into my favorite battery metals stocks, which I began investing in four years ago, well before I achieved my first legal settlement. Thanks! 
81 2018-11-28 23:22:50 Interesting he mentions where stocks are. I guess the Fed keeping rates down and artificially increasing liquidity and pushing money from bonds into the market had nothing to do with it? It was because he was pro biz..sure and I have some ocean front property in Arizona for you
82 2018-11-28 23:21:27 Yes sir! Obviously you would want to try to buy the leading stock(s) with true market leadership potential. If in a situation where things are completely bombed out and no good stocks are in buying position you default by buying the index that is following through. Wade in.

86 2018-11-28 23:18:33 So politicians can make more money on their own GM stocks but screwing taxpayers to do so. What’s new?!
87 2018-11-28 23:18:10 Hey kenner.. well I hope you sold today then. I'm holding my great stocks. Think for yourself!
88 2018-11-28 23:16:14 Well, we won our crew battle. Came down to me at 3 stocks vs their best player at 1. I tried to style a bit too hard when I got a witch time and he took a stock but I won in the end with 2 stocks.
89 2018-11-28 23:15:43 small growth, small caps, money markets, even annuities are all stock market.  They just diversify and are not all in one company or one type of stock.  They may even be tied to foreign stocks.  But they are all paper and can CRASH. buy bit coin Khan they are for you. lol
90 2018-11-28 23:13:28 I didn't take as much as a hit as others did I dumped a lot of tech stocks I recovered nicely 
91 2018-11-28 23:12:53 I agree and almost done with stocks

93 2018-11-28 23:11:42 What’s that leave for investors? Equities!

Interest rate hikes are due to Trump’s improvements. And, as they come up banks pay more interest.

Those whose want to be safer with their investments sell their riskiest stocks and put it in the bank, again. 

But, you know all this.
94 2018-11-28 23:10:35 How do you think the romaine lettuce stocks are doing?
95 2018-11-28 23:09:35 Some jobs are worth more.   Someone making business wide decisions, responsible for thousands upon thousands of workers should be paid far more then the guy who stocks cans of soup.

And from a business sense, they could probably afford to lose 1000 stockboys before one good CEO.
96 2018-11-28 23:09:01 Great day for my stocks. Really great. Glad to see the market have a good day despite some of Trumps recent comments the past few weeks. Gotta thank the Fed too.
97 2018-11-28 23:08:54 I'll bet you would be saying this stupidity if stocks were good under Mr O!!!

99 2018-11-28 23:08:26 Yes,  by having universal background checks ( what is wrong with that?) what right is violated? Outlaw and ban bump stocks? Outlaw extended clips? Outlaw 3D printing of guns, especially plastic guns. An outright ban on Assault Weapons and their progeny, collect all of them.

102 2018-11-28 23:06:29 I am using the BTC natal chart as a foundation for this work, my work is specific to Bitcoin price. However there are sometimes general influences that cross markets that effect the global economy. We saw that with Venus retrograde, both Stocks & Crypto were down with this aspect
103 2018-11-28 23:06:17 I was being conservative for illustration, particularly for those risk-averse in retirement. Got 18% last year with my stocks (but not so much this year!) but that's not the point about what I was saying. 

Think we're both agreed a shitty flat in London for £500k is for losers.

GM took your big tax cuts and bought back their stocks and now they are leaving.
Your tariffs are also part of it.

106 2018-11-28 23:03:49 Needed to be at this level all summer , to late now. How dumb is a market to let stocks get to the lowest ever goin into winter and basically stay at a shit price till its here. Most inefficient I've ever witnessed in a commodity. Mkt seen for months increase prodx wasnt working.
107 2018-11-28 23:02:55 Where are all those jobs?huge tax cuts yet we are losing a lot of jobs and those corporations are putting money back into their own wallets via stocks instead of their workforce, so NO; he lied and he continues to lie and you to follow those lies #LeagueOfBlindFollowers

109 2018-11-28 23:01:33 How the fuck can you blame Democrats?! They are the party talking about sensible gun laws, banning bump stocks, large magazines and... semiautomatic rifles of the assault type, as they are shit as defense but great for mowing down innocent people.

124 2018-11-28 22:52:09 I’ve already told Mr Mogg to just stoke the hysteria to move the market so he can short a few exposed stocks and be happy as he rakes in the millions. (The 90 is not qualified to offer financial advice; you may get back less than you invest - 90’s lawyer)
125 2018-11-28 22:51:27 Quite an abrupt about face by Fed chair today. Stocks celebrated, of course. Hugerally (a-b-c anyone?) would not surprise, even ATHs?? OTOH, $HGX '18 action + recent Oct action of $WTIC & $HYS (the latter esp in light of Fed's FSR today) will keep our eyes wide open into '19

129 2018-11-28 22:48:00 The melt-up is in stocks and that's what I traded. I even pointed it out early in the move :-D
FX and bonds have to make up their minds still.
130 2018-11-28 22:47:56 People are quick to throw stones at the fed and shout about the ‘everything bubble’. 

Then they freak out as the Fed raises rates (slowest hiking cycle in history) in order to stop inflating these bubbles.. ala housing, stocks and credit (none of which have ‘broken down’)
131 2018-11-28 22:47:52 Yea Cory.. and why don't you and your Denocrat colleagues, celebrity friends of Democrats, and so on return all your profits from stocks and other gains banked since President T has been in Office....the market's been good to many, or has it singled out Democrats for no gains.
132 2018-11-28 22:47:42 Oracle Corp (ORCL) stock rose by 1.5809% ... now priced at 48.19. #stocks
133 2018-11-28 22:47:29 New Balance stocks has skyrocketed since Kawhi has joined the team, fully recovering from the tragic plunge from signing @BizNasty2point0 as a New Balance “athlete”
134 2018-11-28 22:47:26 Hard to feel sorry for them. The tax cuts enabled companies to buy back stocks, pay off debt, and invest in automation. They say small cars aren't selling, well that's cuz they're cars suck. Tesla is selling cars and expanding.
135 2018-11-28 22:47:23 put your stocks in bonds.

137 2018-11-28 22:46:43 People still think its all about weather all the time in #natgas. Not this year, stocks are lower than they have ever been at the end of November! Even a bit below avg temps this winter and we draw down to minimums.
138 2018-11-28 22:46:42 Can @JeffreeStar make a video of his investments like if he owns stocks or if any other way he makes his income because Lowkey I’m intrigued in that area
139 2018-11-28 22:46:41 A large proportion of stocks are still in the doldrums with plenty of opportunity for people to sift through them if they need to reposition.

But you wouldn't think today was the day . It's still going to take time before the dormant ones get going if indeed markets do improve
140 2018-11-28 22:44:23 If fed futures are discounting an 80% chance of a hike. On any given day stocks discount 60% chance. And every time they rally he can say “see.. economy is good.. AND STOCKS UP”
141 2018-11-28 22:44:05 It’s the beginning of the end of democracy Dump stocks,, Buy gold
142 2018-11-28 22:44:02 That's what makes a market. Hopefully all of our stocks will rise in 2019.

147 2018-11-28 22:41:44 Absolutely agree on the need for catch up for boys. Time ran out for my son. We payed for First gardasil 9 jab in September just before he set off for university. As soon as stocks back in UK we made appt. Relief.
148 2018-11-28 22:41:00 Better late than never. 
I guess the military complex have tested their new toys and depleted their stocks in turn to receive big hand outs courtesy of the tax payer.

149 2018-11-28 22:40:15 Home Value = Good Blue/White Collar Jobs = Monthly maintenance = long-term communities with shared values = NO Crime! Most African Americans do not support inflated home values, high taxes. Homes are NOT STOCKS!

154 2018-11-28 22:34:25 Other than maybe your 401k, do you own any stocks and gain from that great 600 points? I doubt it, but the rich on the other hand should be dancing in the streets, I would be. #wakeup

175 2018-11-28 22:23:51 Dow being up 600 does nothing for those struggling.  It is more of a representation of the top 1%.  Not a good measuring stick to compare stocks to jobs and/or wages.  Different worlds.
176 2018-11-28 22:23:51 Evening Market Wrap-up: stocks close sharply higher after Feds dovish speech that interest rates are close to neutral.

179 2018-11-28 22:23:28 Marzipan apps are ‘desk accessories’ if News, Stocks and Voice Memos in Mojave are any indication. 

Using them on a Mac makes me think about iOS in general.  Even the best productivity apps (Affinity for example) are constraint-bound by touch almost as much as by iOS.
180 2018-11-28 22:21:43 I thought some mates were looking at 22K Dow by Dec 31

Why didnt we do a zero-based budget to put that surplus to tangible use for the man on the street if it was a real surplus?
183 2018-11-28 22:20:46 That was me 2 years ago. Was doing great trading stocks, thought I was King shit so why not do options they are easy money. Lost my ass and went into a deep depression

184 2018-11-28 22:20:18 Some will hold stocks years without seeing a significant return, others will wait 2-3 years for a game developer to release, and yet the impatience and immaturity of some people for which arguably is the greatest tech of our lifetime is astounding...
185 2018-11-28 22:19:59 Stocks went up because Fed Chairman said they would be more dovish on rate hikes. But, you go on and do your, “orange man bad” schtick, no one will stop you.

192 2018-11-28 22:16:13 The main thing to watch for now is no distribution. Leaders need to make progress above their pivots and more quality stocks need to break out of bases on strong volume.

201 2018-11-28 22:10:53 Cryptocurrencies seem to be interpreted as risky investment like stocks, so it goes down in unsecure times. Unlike gold which is a save haven. The interesting thing is that in countries with unstable currencies like venezuela, turkey etc cryptos are already a save haven..
202 2018-11-28 22:09:50 The government has it in stocks they haven't sold yet. There was a deal made and GM lived up to it.

208 2018-11-28 22:08:08 Companies used to sell stocks to equity investors and use the proceeds to grow their businesses.

Now companies sell bonds to credit investors and use the proceeds to buy shares from equity investors.

219 2018-11-28 22:01:54 @jowens510 why were social media stocks flat today when the rest of tech rebounded?
220 2018-11-28 22:01:54 stocks for calculated goods are down 5%. they have to clear the bottom end of the supply to bring up the value again. period.
221 2018-11-28 22:01:51 The last two weeks have been painful for many. Now is a great time to review your investment policy, ensure you are comfortable with your risk, and potentially reallocate accordingly.

234 2018-11-28 21:58:58 I guess that it could work, following the principle of "whoever is downrange deserves it".

For a more discriminate application of lead, I'd at least get one of those flimsy stocks that lock in the rear part of the grip/frame.

237 2018-11-28 21:58:15 Hi! I have a supplier directly from SoKor. These lightsticks are not on hand but pre-order. ETA is on January. We're also waiting for stocks, that's why it's on preorder. And by January, we can already get the products.
238 2018-11-28 21:55:53 She may be thinking of the TARP money, which they fully paid w 7% interest. Either that or the money we lost from stock sales of devalued govt-owned stocks. If we hadnt done the takeover the US would've lost over 1 million jobs at a time where job creation was almost impossible.
239 2018-11-28 21:55:43 And that's why stocks soared? huh? Oh wait, that's from Yahoo News, they've never written anything good or truthful about any Republican.

243 2018-11-28 21:51:13 Fed put at 2600 on S&P 500. Stocks should have broken down Monday after horrible closes Wednesday and Friday. Japanese Yen began to weaken at 1AM Monday morning EST, S&P's began to lift, Powell follows up with a dovish I have your back 59 hours later: Fed put is 2600!

250 2018-11-28 21:46:59 I am not a huge fan of stock games, and my version of stocks isn't really the same as 18xx games have. But it's often a key piece of the genre, and so it's fitting to include it.

317 2018-11-28 21:19:39 Can see some chopping for the next two days while pro-Trump and anti-Trump sentiment plays ping pong.  Since he never prepares and believes he's the best negotiator in the world (maybe he is, I don't know), he might walk away initially and we can see how stocks handle that.
318 2018-11-28 21:19:34 I totally agree Lindsay. Growing tuna in a lab should be the last resort.  What we need is no take zones to allow for stocks to recover however, this a big challenge for pelagic species.

330 2018-11-28 21:15:28 It's noteworthy that stocks and bonds both rallied on Powell's "neutral" remarks, suggesting this is a plain vanilla Fed/inflation driven market, not a risk-on/risk-off/deflation market.

332 2018-11-28 21:13:24 Not as much of an impact on how low float stocks trade on an intraday basis, but on how it reflects on overall strength/weakness of the small cap market I think there is some correlation.

335 2018-11-28 21:12:09 I'd argue that stock buybacks violate the fiduciary responsibility to the shareholders from whom stocks are not bought back. It also is a form of stock market manipulation because the company drives its share price up without profitability or productivity going up.
336 2018-11-28 21:12:05 People listen to alarmist comments from nobodies, panic & sell. Your retail ETFs, index funds, mutual funds, stocks are all subject to massive outflows and there's nothing you can do about it...ONLY THERE IS and that's STAY THE COURSE! Markets always rebound.
337 2018-11-28 21:11:05 We need a public naughty corner. Stocks outside Parliament? Demeaning punishment for demeaning behavior?
338 2018-11-28 21:11:00 So basically it turns out that stocks were down because of interest rates, and it always was interest rates and in the future the main factor will be interest rates.

Sorry politicians.

361 2018-11-28 20:59:50 That's what they call dead cat bounce.  Short recovery, shorting stocks means you have to buy it at your targeted price.  If you have the same buy in as others then you get a jump in the stock, but only to find more shorting the stock further.
362 2018-11-28 20:59:26 The drop in the Dow Jones was due to de-risking.

Therefore it makes sense that speculative, emerging asset classes got sold off at the same time. They are not as separate as some may think.

Just my opinion.

366 2018-11-28 20:59:01 I suspect that the markets haven’t fully priced-in the expectation of Parliament rejecting May’s deal. If you have a portfolio held in Sterling stocks I suggest that now is a good time to move them to Dollars or Euros...

Nope, me neither.

And stocks are up enough to put one rate hike back on the table
369 2018-11-28 20:56:43 Dow up 600+ pts heading for the close, or +2.4%. S&P +2.2%. Nasdaq the winner, +2.9%. Russell +2.4%. WTI -2.2% at $50.41. Ten-yr at 3.056%. #mkts #stocks #fed #federalreserve @anthonymace
370 2018-11-28 20:56:31 The USD is moving lower and stocks are moving higher after #FederalReserve chairman Powell says that rates are just below the neutral range.
371 2018-11-28 20:55:39 You clearly have no idea how to make money from failing currency and stocks. Look up 'Shorting' and learn something. Tell me how 'factored-in' comes into play when a currency crashes. And that's just the amateur end of it.
372 2018-11-28 20:55:11 Hold the Teroldego, we are now on the red "stocks" of the beautiful wonderful Refosco. A simply lovely red from Friuli

377 2018-11-28 20:52:07 Thanx. But it doesn't move the needle very much. 5% position per stock and 5 stocks. A little defensive <200SMA. But it all ads up, so no complaints.
378 2018-11-28 20:51:38 this really big mo will come in on avg to below avg volume for indexes and on many stocks
379 2018-11-28 20:51:37 I’ll confirm this is happening where I live. Partner’s company doing very well, stocks hitting all time highs... they just created new department in India (over 2k positions). Considering other U.S. positions to move overseas.  
380 2018-11-28 20:51:28 Trump and Pubs gave them a massive tax cut and they used it to buy bac their stocks and enrich their execs and still lay off workers.  Corporate. Tax. Cuts. Don't. Create. Jobs.

390 2018-11-28 20:48:55 Indices are WAY up over the last few years. That's just fact. It's not about my stocks or yours. Or about liars. Yeah this calendar year was flat but any major index you look at is off the charts. And unemployment is virtually zero. The statistics are published. Check em.
391 2018-11-28 20:48:49 Defend our second amendment rights? You mean like the national concealed carry bill sitting in the senate that you refuse to pass? The illegal ban on bump stocks? How about the unconstitutional ban on fully automatics which we have a right to? Yeah nothing is getting done.
392 2018-11-28 20:48:33 It’s nice to see that my stocks are doing good

395 2018-11-28 20:45:13 Stocks have been surging today after dovish comments by #FederalReserve Chairman Jerome Powell about interest rates. Now only if we could get a China deal in a few days, stocks would surge toward the year-end. ~ George Leong, Profit Confidential #WednesdayWisdom
396 2018-11-28 20:45:02 Some of the stocks I watch are turning into Teslas. The vol is just nauseating. Megaphones all over the place (higher highs and lower lows).

424 2018-11-28 20:34:24 I love how stocks jump on the most bullish interpretation of Powell's comments! But if we are "just below the broad estimates" on neutral funds and an informed estimate of those broad estimates is 2.5-3.5%. Should we assume we are going to stop close to the bottom of that range?
425 2018-11-28 20:33:54 So the Fed acknowledges there’s big risks & that they are data dependent which THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN and the market breathes a sigh of relief heading into real important meeting which will likely disappoint and we r supposed to buy more stocks?Got it.This is a OS rally that’s it

430 2018-11-28 20:31:28 Respectfully, sir, the stock market is tied to jobs and the economy. Stocks represent investments in companies. When the stock market expands, the economy expands. When the economy expands, wages increase and employment increases--which is happening. Surely you must know this?
431 2018-11-28 20:30:44 Yes, it is and will continue to be! Where other place would you like to put your "wealth" the last 10 years? Like all stocks, 10 years lifetime, before correction..

473 2018-11-28 20:12:39 Anyone who follows the stock market, might have noticed how stocks spiked, around noon, when the @federalreserve commented about slowing their decision, to raise interest rates!
474 2018-11-28 20:12:25 If I was given stocks instead of the money originally loaned, and I had to sell that stock at a loss, then obviously the company needs to fork over more money.
You pay back what is borrowed, plus some, or you don't borrow at all.

489 2018-11-28 20:05:13 Problem with an economy driven by the stock market gains is that people don't sell their stocks to buy things.  Instead, they spend cash-on-hand or take on debt.  Then when the stock market crashes, they have paper losses on their stocks and lots of debt.

498 2018-11-28 19:57:14 Who is right TODAY about the direction of the U.S. economy... the millions buying stocks... or Fed policy makers!
499 2018-11-28 19:56:45 I don't think we can know what we really risk, right? Market could go up 20% or down 30% in the next 12 months. Nobody knows. According to your blog, you did invest more money in the past few months, right? Therefore, you must be finding interesting stocks to invest in?
500 2018-11-28 19:56:39 @ChrisJReining hey man! Would love to know more about the basket of stocks you own. I'm 100% index fund at the moment, but I'm putting together a basket myself. Maybe a blog post? Anyway, love your work. Keep it up!
501 2018-11-28 19:55:42 Airline Stocks That Look Ready to Rise
502 2018-11-28 19:55:26 @Asad_Umar Today, we successfully opened Kurtapur border & achieved a big landmark, thanks to @ImranKhanPTI but our Pakistan Stock Exchange is still going down, lost 200 points. Though, today Indian stock market gained more than 200 points. Other Asian & US stocks are also up.
503 2018-11-28 19:55:06 You can still buy bump stocks (they cost more and are far more profitable though)
504 2018-11-28 19:54:36 What 'excuse' will 'mainstream-media' give today for stocks 'rising' again... anything but the facts of the matter, and NEW U.S. leadership policy.

506 2018-11-28 19:53:54 USD/JPY's dump while stocks soared goes exactly to my point about a #Fed policy reversal being extremely negative for the dollar. Powell's dovish comment today clearly illustrated that as it is great for stocks but a disaster for the dollar. This is why the correlation broke down
507 2018-11-28 19:53:18 Obama got 41k more jobs per month on average, and stocks are where they were a year ago. Lol, plus two TRILLION more in debt. #fail

513 2018-11-28 19:50:42 Have stocks gone up enough where China is now more dangerous than the Federal Reserve?
514 2018-11-28 19:50:40 Dile que lea, por ejemplo, a Siegel en 'Stocks for the long run'.
515 2018-11-28 19:50:25 Wasn't involved in today's market action, & won't be, but I know it's typical for traders to wait for news or events of this kind, regardless what is said, & falsely push stocks up in the hope to trigger Short-Seller thresholds & bots. If not enough found, then flat & back down.
516 2018-11-28 19:50:23 As I posted recently in my feed, only ONE of past THREE major Fed pauses/stops was bullish longer-term (mid-1990s). Other pauses came at/near asset market peaks (first tech stocks, then housing) in May 2000, June 2006
517 2018-11-28 19:50:21 Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell has tempered his tone on rate hikes. The late Marty Zweig’s nostrums are well known — “Don’t fight the Fed,” “Don’t fight the tape” — “Generally a rising trend in rates is bearish for stocks; a falling trend is bullish,”

He was in a hotel about 30 floors up, of course they had trouble. He built barricades in the room blocking doors.

You're using a movie to make a point? Hollywood gun accuracy...…..
523 2018-11-28 19:46:30 Bullshit, yeah some stock options are too expensive for most (including myself) but that doesn't mean you can't take $10 out of your check and invest it in penny stocks or even partial stocks. I'm sure most of the people who you're referring to spend that on scratch-offs daily.
524 2018-11-28 19:46:29 POTUS why don't you let all the Dems take all the money their stocks have made since Nov 2016 and then they could offer to support the migrants in their own country. Problem solved.
525 2018-11-28 19:46:17 BULLISH only for #american #cannabis stocks?
526 2018-11-28 19:46:14 Last time: please make Ultimate 4-5 stocks
527 2018-11-28 19:46:10 You are correct, but personally I feel there should be a decrease in certain types of guns owned by "civilians." I don't agree with the general population owning military grade weapons or bump stocks. Guns for home protection and hunting are fine.
528 2018-11-28 19:46:09 We think alike, I just tweeted: "If stocks are ripping ⇧  because of #Powell's dovish comments, shouldn't 2 yr Tsys...being make more than a half-hearted effort at rallying? With stocks up 500+ on Powell's remarks, who would have bet 2yrs would've ralied only 3 basis points?"
529 2018-11-28 19:45:02 This is NOT BULLISH for #Canadian #cannabis stocks?

What if they play Ultimate with 4 stocks?? 
534 2018-11-28 19:43:17 Yeah, your boss @jkenney was part of the government that handed GM this money even though they knew they'd never get it back AND THEN they sold off GM stocks at a massive loss. #FakeNewsDrews, the man that was wrong about everything. #LakeOfFireParty #NeverKenney #AbLeg #abpoli

C'est pas "prix" mais "cours du dollar" !
538 2018-11-28 19:40:03 Given what Fed chair Powell said today about the future of interest rates (trend should STILL be LOWER)... and what is happening to stocks at the moment... WHO is right about what has been 'shackling' the stock market!

552 2018-11-28 19:31:47 Exactly, well stated. Ridiculous to draw investment management conclusions from one drawn out period of one way index outperformance. That said, the game has changed because there is so much money and so few stocks left to choose from. 9000 stocks in 90s is now 3500 stocks
553 2018-11-28 19:31:36 Put that money into savings or start getting into stocks with that
554 2018-11-28 19:31:34 You clearly have no clue the affect social media had on stocks. A very obvious example is trump tweeting about Amazon, they dropped a few percent.
555 2018-11-28 19:31:29 But R2R won’t you be missing out on the dividends ? Besides stocks you bought 10 years ago gave you a decent margin of security, no?

562 2018-11-28 19:29:27 4stocks would happen if the stalling characters didn't exist in the game. The gameplay we're seeing now is 100% a 3 stock game and that's before any optimisation at all. 1 year from now 3 stocks will be gone very fast. The problem is really the stalling characters though.
563 2018-11-28 19:29:21 A one-stock story or are defensive stocks back in favor?
564 2018-11-28 19:29:02 Why are stocks rallying on Powell?

1) Did he really throw a meaty bone w "rates are just below neutral?"

2) What else should FOMC Chair say besides "One more and we keep looking at data?"

3) Futures barely priced 2 hikes 2019 so who really believed #DotPlot was hawkish script?
565 2018-11-28 19:28:58 Food stocks under pressure today despite the mkt rally following the $SJM Q3 EPS/sales miss and lower guidance, dragging $MDLZ, $GIS, $CPB lower today
566 2018-11-28 19:28:44 If stocks are ripping ⇧  because of #Powell's dovish comments, shouldn't 2 yr Tsys, specifically, and rates, in general, being make more than a half-hearted effort at rallying? With stocks up 500+ on Powell's remarks, who would have bet 2yrs would've ralied only 3 basis points?
567 2018-11-28 19:27:47 Now, now, it has nothing to do w/ the stock mkt's decline. Coincidentally (purely coincidentally - kinda like magic), the neutral rate just happened to drop down since Powell last spoke & is now just above the Funds rate. "In unrelated news, stocks sold off hard last month...."

570 2018-11-28 19:24:59 You did nothing to promote anything positive for America!! Stocks, oil, etc was not made better from anything you did!! Trump has worked hard to undo your lies and destruction.

583 2018-11-28 19:20:22 All these companies dont realize that by moving good paying jobs overseas, no one will have money to buy their goods. Ripple effect. Idiots. Make buyback of stocks illegal. Give money to stockholders as a dividend.

586 2018-11-28 19:19:26 @realDonaldTrump 84% of stocks are owned by just the richest 10% of America.  The richest 1% of America owns over 40% of ALL WEALTH here. Yet you cut taxes for the richest (corporations) from 35% to 21%, and for the richest Americans, you cut tax rate from 39% to 37%. Shame.

618 2018-11-28 19:10:03 And there it is, I was only a few days late. Bond yields are at record lows, cash in the bank is technically losing money due to inflation so stocks are still the greatest return at the moment. Fear caused this drop not fundamentals. All my own opinion of course

626 2018-11-28 19:07:30 "DJIA: Dow Jones Jumps Above 25k as Powell, FOMC Adapt to Global Risks"US stocks are ripping-higher on the back of a speech from FOMC Chair, Jerome Powell. The removal of a key pressure point may keep the door open for continued strength.
627 2018-11-28 19:06:49 When I was a chase producer for a 24-hour biz/stocks channel, yes, every guest had to disclose any stocks or other ownership they had in any companies they discussed on-air - and yes, we put it on the chyron. Interesting idea for non-biz shows.

629 2018-11-28 19:05:57 Which FANG stock would I recommend for investors with high or low risk tolerance, and which would I not buy under any circumstances? I reviewed the FANG stocks -- plus $AAPL and $TWTR -- in this week's issue of Cabot Undervalued Stocks Advisor. $FB $AMZN $NFLX $GOOGL
630 2018-11-28 19:05:26 DEFCON 5 has been reached.  Put your crash helmet on, strap on tite, high polish, and hope you don't need it.  But there's no warnings left, either get to cash now, or it might be too late if you think you'll be able to have more time to sell ur stocks.

631 2018-11-28 19:05:17 That would help stocks too? Looks like stocks already liking it..
632 2018-11-28 19:05:06 Can someone tell me - should we take savings OUT of stocks & shares ISAs ahead of the Brexit deal vote?  @MartinSLewis @simonnread @Jasmine @richardevans10 @paullewismoney @jeffprestridge
633 2018-11-28 19:04:45 sell into big up move today. mkts have it wrong..think tech is going right back up. no, div, and util are down..buys..rates wont rise much more as fed said so dividend stocks are buys. the general kt is still overpirced..as FED said as well.
634 2018-11-28 19:03:40 I’d think gaming stocks would be reacting better today, at the very least $TTWO considering the recent RDR2 numbers. Too early to tell on $EA, but they should all be higher.

636 2018-11-28 19:03:32 Stocks roaring after Powell remarks that rate hikes not predetermined, rates close to neutral and global instabilities not threatening, Dow up 546/2.15% at 25,287; S&P up 2.3%; Nasdaq +2.4%. #stocks #fed #federalreserve @anthonymace
637 2018-11-28 19:03:29 Investors continue to ask me about General Electric (GE). I'll reiterate my recommendation on how to handle the stock in the December issue of Cabot Undervalued Stocks Advisor. $GE
638 2018-11-28 19:03:04 Another flag on $SPY here....keep this in mind.  Dow up 1k points this week.  Need to see #Banking stocks rally in line with tech to see the next pivot imo
639 2018-11-28 19:02:53 Stocks are benefiting today from what appears to be a slow down of rate hikes by the Fed Reserve. Watch inflation closely.
640 2018-11-28 19:02:17 Trump Put under the market. This means stocks will move higher.
641 2018-11-28 19:01:28 United Technologies (UTX) is splitting into three companies. What should you do with their stock? I'll review UTX in the December issue of Cabot Undervalued Stocks Advisor. $UTX
642 2018-11-28 19:00:11 There are a lot of moving parts to the General Motors (GM) news. Unfortunately, people & media are getting distracted by making it political. I'll discuss the REAL issues in the December issue of Cabot Undervalued Stocks Advisor. $GM
643 2018-11-28 18:59:48 I really don't like that my son isn't doing fire drills/earthquake drills but instead, active shooter drills.

644 2018-11-28 18:59:45 With some dilution is over. I think the problem with some, IMHO, is flippers and those thinking they're going to make thousands of $$$ a day flipping stocks like pancakes. It ruins it for those long term investors looking to add some great buys to their long term portfolio.
645 2018-11-28 18:59:24 U.S. stocks rallied the most in three weeks and the dollar fell after a dovish tone from the Federal Reserve chairman fueled speculation the central bank is closer than thought to pausing on rate hikes - Bloomberg

659 2018-11-28 18:55:00 Your tweet reminded me of my belief that short selling should not be legal, as I think it inherently encourages unethical behavior. Having the option of betting on a stock to go down creates an incentive for failure and manipulation of stocks.
660 2018-11-28 18:54:17 Hey @matt_levine I  your column the other days about the warren buffet stock index thought experiment. It got me thinking - is really any combination of stocks based on anything worthy of the name index? because then it really would be meaningless.

669 2018-11-28 18:51:01 Just a worthless opinion, but I doubt it. You can pt to all the individual stocks you want being down 20% but $SPX was down 10% and 14.9x next years earnings is not the kind of measure you'd get at an "overreaction." This doesn't mean they can't go higher here.

688 2018-11-28 18:42:36 Yeah, the real story is the Fed is worried we're in a slowdown or even a recession. The Dow going up is just money moving from bonds to stocks. It's temporary.

712 2018-11-28 18:34:20 yeah but the 64 scene is much smaller than what the ultimate scene is going to be. doing 4 stocks for every set, not including the bo5 sets, could potentially be waaaaaaaaaay too much

734 2018-11-28 18:26:10 US economy is doing pretty well, the problem is the ruling class (nearly all republicans and most corporate democrats) are enacting and keeping alive policies beneficial to the wealthy. They're touting stock exchange numbers when more than half of America isn't invested in stocks
735 2018-11-28 18:26:01 When I saw a legit 1v1 stream with good players and finally no items I actually thought it's possible to play this with 4 stocks. 1v1 multiplier (with items off, which we didnt really have much footage off) does a lot (items on has a lower multiplier) and gimping is huge.

- Faster gameplay

- Combo wise it seems like a cross between Smash4 and Brawl, which I love
- Sword characters seem busted 
- More stage variety
- More viable characters
- 3 stocks(?)

Had my doubts at first, but not anymore
749 2018-11-28 18:21:53 Hey DI, what stocks are the best and safest reit/real estate stocks in Canada?
750 2018-11-28 18:21:42 Well if a conservative invested in stocks today they would consider it a win like myself
751 2018-11-28 18:19:51 Very very True!!!
752 2018-11-28 18:19:49 What’s the point of bump stocks INSIDE a range? Fun? If that’s all there is in it for anyone why risk having them exist at all? It’s not worth the risk to me. I’ve have a gun pointed at me by an angry person before. It’s not a feeling I’d wish on anyone.
753 2018-11-28 18:19:46 Do u think the game should be 4 stocks or 3? It does seem like you can kill faster in this game then smash 4
754 2018-11-28 18:19:45 Meanwhile smart people sell stocks into the rally and buy #bitcoin.

Go #Bitcoin!
755 2018-11-28 18:19:15 bond market is smarter, but probably positioning for December hike and just selling because people think stocks will rally, which will be short lived. Bonds long term still attractive
756 2018-11-28 18:19:00 Sub £10mln AIM stocks been totally shunned and battered by market since August 
Feels tide is turning
757 2018-11-28 18:18:59 you shall buy stocks.. you shall spend, lend and consume...you shall not touch gold #Fivecommandments
758 2018-11-28 18:17:54 Settlement between stocks with xrp that’s nice
759 2018-11-28 18:17:31 LOL. keep thinking that. 
Stocks will ultimately be secured by a scaling layer of #Bitcoin. No CEO will say I want the 2nd most secure network.  Utility tokens are garbage. No one want a pocket full of prepaid cards.
760 2018-11-28 18:17:25 Well, stocks are up by +3.32, so if it keeps going up then in his mind the show is perfect. 
761 2018-11-28 18:16:57 *NSE TOP LOSERS GOOD STOCKS*

764 2018-11-28 18:15:08 What about bump stocks?
765 2018-11-28 18:15:04 In 2014, there was a Boss Rush where @PG_Plup w/ 16 stocks played vs Socal's A-Team

@Legend0fLucky basically won game 1 by star KOing Samus, but jumped offstage with lasers & SD'd for the loss

My PC blue screened right after & I still refuse to believe it was not Joey's fault
766 2018-11-28 18:14:31 Their current IPO valuation is at 2.4 billion & rising. Their stocks rose up to $750/share from $400/share in April. Share price will go up near the IPO. Their profit margin is much higher than big 3. YG has over 400 employees vs BH’s 100. BH’s has less expense, so more profit.
767 2018-11-28 18:13:39 apple stocks rise by 69%.
768 2018-11-28 18:11:59 The problem is that businesses don’t invest it back into labour but either buy back stocks or invest in machinery. It isn’t capitalism. Capitalism is a macrocosm representing an entire network of economic factors promoting the good for all aspects of society.
769 2018-11-28 18:11:36 They don’t even know it but @DayTradeWarrior and @timothysykes taught me so much about trading stocks from their YouTube videos.
770 2018-11-28 18:11:36 Greenspan pioneered the unspoken mandate that STOCKS = ECONOMY. Bernanke and later,  Yellen solidified this concept. Now Powell will cement it.
771 2018-11-28 18:10:32 @The_Trump_Train If the DEMS could rig stocks to have unlimited, YES UNLIMITED MONEY $$$$$$$$$$$$$ then this Nation would never be sovereign again.  NEVER.  Cases 1:02 cv 01242 GBL ED VA and 06 CIV 170 SD NY SAS.  Check your pockets, YOU HAVE BEEN ROBBED BLIND.  DEMS CHEAT !!!!!!
772 2018-11-28 18:10:20 Stocks haven’t moved at all
773 2018-11-28 18:09:14 Who said anything about stocks?
774 2018-11-28 18:08:37 Tengo tb jereces; lo difícil es encontrar vinos antes de la perestroika , la mayoría de los stocks fueron destruidos
775 2018-11-28 18:08:04 The operative word in Powell’s  is “range.”  The range of neutral is 2.5 to 3.5%. Stocks are ahead of themselves. Note both the 30 year and 10 year yields are higher.
776 2018-11-28 18:08:01 Been slacking on day trading , finna pick it back up #EasyMoney #Crypto #Stocks
777 2018-11-28 18:08:01 If you equate this space with Stocks, then you know nothing! #Bticoin and money has nothing to do with stocks. Using that lens will only get you #rekt!
778 2018-11-28 18:07:53 On another note: Looks like trump has now successfully influenced the fed which is supposed to be an independent agency. Stocks will rise now, but we are now susceptible to overheated markets and have fewer tools to deal with a recession later. Nothing’s safe from this guy.
779 2018-11-28 18:07:44 Today is a good day to invest in coal stocks
780 2018-11-28 18:07:35 Stocks rip higher after Fed chair signals rates near neutral 
---
TRUMP HAS MANAGED TO INTIMIDATE POWELL INTO TOWING THE PARTY LINE.
---
This does nothing to change the structural instabilities in the U.S. as well as GLOBAL ECONOMIES.
781 2018-11-28 18:07:28 Yep. Bond market is not buying it. Let's see if stocks fall into the close. That would be interesting because it would mean the market wants a higher dose of easing
782 2018-11-28 18:06:46 Crude oil is now cheap - energy stocks are very cheap - tax loss selling has less than 2 weeks left.
783 2018-11-28 18:06:10 Stocks add to gains on the "just below neutral" text from Powell. Dow +350 points.
784 2018-11-28 18:05:56 Share the list too ,of stocks that double every 3 yrs... Market has changed the definition of long term investing!!
785 2018-11-28 18:05:52 8. While the disability process took 3 years to approve his 100% disabled dad... without that very phone.. his dad would have been homeless. Let that sink in. And he made money legal trading stocks. Believe this shit if u want. But its a non news issue.
786 2018-11-28 18:05:48 The narrative is that a #FederalReserve #interestrate hiking "pause/stop" is bullish for stocks. But as I've pointed out in the past several days, that was only true in 33% (1 of 3) cases over the past quarter century - the mid-1990s when we had a "soft landing"
787 2018-11-28 18:05:41 They bought tamper bay in 95 and the Glazer owned a diverse portfolio of investments, which included food service equipment, food packaging and food supplies, marine protein, broadcasting, health care, property, banking, natural gas n oil, stocks and bonds n still spent o on us
788 2018-11-28 18:05:32 Stocks open higher, Dow +160 points.
789 2018-11-28 18:05:14 When Strong fundamental stocks available in cheap and every side only one noise sell,sell,sell most of the time that stock proved them self like diamond.

Will surely add few shares from any dips from current zone,A PSU bank deserve 100+ price than why not #Yesbank.

790 2018-11-28 18:05:10 Of course, what's he going to say..."According to the most reliable valuation metrics, U.S. stocks are about as extremely overvalued, if not more so, than they've ever been in history including 1929 and 2000." So what do we really expect...
791 2018-11-28 18:04:40 I think Powell did a good job today. We needed to know he wasn't tone deaf and relying on old paradigms for rates. Anyway you slice it, its good news for stocks as the Fed typically kills bull markets.
792 2018-11-28 18:04:22 USD goes up, stocks, cryptos all assets go down. USD goes down..... then everything else goes up
793 2018-11-28 18:04:19 Commercial stocks are now only 3.2Mb below last year at 453.7Mb.
794 2018-11-28 18:04:10 For those who think $BTCUSD has some kind of loose correlation to stocks indices, it was already up big way before the Powell comments.
795 2018-11-28 18:03:26 Anyone besides me see trump as economic dodo? Tax cut - no jobs or raises but deficit blowup & broken bank. Tariffs driving corps abroad, leaving crops rotting in fields, killing jobs. Takes credit for lower gas prices but also lowered stocks & the price was Kashoggi.
796 2018-11-28 18:03:07 Well done, Jay! Stocks up. Dollar index down. Let’s keep it that way-it’s Trump’s way!

798 2018-11-28 18:02:43 Zero... my clients are not in individual stocks. That’s like saying all the money managers and hedge funds that post on twitter what they own, have a conflict of interest. 
Let me know when you close your Vktx short.
799 2018-11-28 18:02:02 seems to be Vix was lagging stocks. vol has been very very steady throughout this selloff (apart from some intraday spikes), so seeing it get pounded today would not make much sense
800 2018-11-28 18:01:47 I thought most americans indirectly owned stocks via their PF's and IRA/401k's?
801 2018-11-28 18:01:40 crap. Already proved this after my DK took 4 stocks off of your secondaries last weekend smh
802 2018-11-28 18:01:12 @jpmorgan and @Chase...I know you do investing. Have you thought about doing something similar to Acorns...allow your credit card users to round up their change and invest in stocks and EFTs but at a lower fee than Acorns? Or no fee for Chase customers. Just a thought.
803 2018-11-28 18:00:53 Why post notes on stocks in bearish or stagnant chart patterns? To remind myself and readers of which stocks to avoid. Protect your capital.

Funny how Mueller that helped facilitate the Uranium 1 deal with Russia selling 20% of the U.S.'s Uranium stocks is the one investigating you about "Russian Collusion" You forgot to put George Soros on this meme. He should be the 1st to go to trial.
812 2018-11-28 17:59:13 Fed Powell causing a nice short squeeze in #stocks today.
813 2018-11-28 17:59:12 All stocks have difficulties at times. Bashing those you hold isn’t productive - creates negative sentiment in the short term when the long term outlook is very good. I’ve seen this many times on stocks that I’ve held and those I haven’t. You’re entitled to your opinion though.
814 2018-11-28 17:59:08 Bonjour @LaGrinta !
La maintenance du site est encore prévue pour longtemps !
Parce que pour commander, c’est pas super pratique !!!
Ou alors y’a rupture de stocks ?
Merci d’avance
815 2018-11-28 17:59:02 @jimmycTHFC up 500 cause powell is starting to get with the fucking program     stocks are incredibly under valued assumeing everythign works out...i believe europe is very close to a continent blow up
816 2018-11-28 17:58:52 Mannnnn there’s no feeling like seeing the stocks you invested in go up 
817 2018-11-28 17:58:49 Le Brent n’est pas tout le problème: composition des gisements en différents produits, prix du dollar, réservés et stocks, marchés à terme, coûts de raffinage et de transport, etc.
818 2018-11-28 17:58:20 #SHI is one of strange Stocks that I have a totally irrational bias against. Something planted a seed in my brain many many years ago about this being a pretty average business and nothing has ever been able to change that stance  !!
819 2018-11-28 17:58:08 Neither of you guys have addressed the fact that Dole foods had too many stocks or that our government has legalized a bail in for the banks
820 2018-11-28 17:58:04 Great news for savers? Inflation will increase to 6.5% ... savers will be doomed as they have been since the #CreditCrunch - the only way out would be to hold foreign stocks which will get a lift from the falling £
821 2018-11-28 17:57:48 Dow welcomes Powell remarks with 490 pt intraday gain, seeing the bright side of his comments that rate decisions are not predetermined. #stocks #fed #economu @anthonymace
822 2018-11-28 17:57:14 @dosxxy Hey Kristen can you believe Trump blaming the U.S. Car maker Chevrolet. The stocks are down & he's taking more air out of the tire. If they hadn't outsourced so much work to Asian & India. From Jobs to telemarketing they are paying for it now!
823 2018-11-28 17:56:57 Goodnight bonds.  This will go down in history as a very significant day.  If you own housing stocks...get the fuck out now.
824 2018-11-28 17:56:56 Nothing new. Appeasing everyone though. Also giving some room to raise in December as yield curve is widening slightly. No one cares if they hike as long as stocks go up
825 2018-11-28 17:56:19 stocks#
826 2018-11-28 17:55:48 Having said that, I still don't plan to increase my exposure to this house of cards even though stocks probably continue higher to end the year.
827 2018-11-28 17:55:27 US markets shooting up after Fed comments. I expect UK stocks to continue to lag as long as there is Brexit uncertainty.
828 2018-11-28 17:55:11 so why are stocks ralyling agian?
829 2018-11-28 17:54:40 Like a nickel bag’s worth of pot stocks?
830 2018-11-28 17:54:37 STOCKS WILL RALLY TEN'S OF THOUSANDS OF POINTS WHEN @realDonaldTrump MAKES A TRADE DEAL WITH THE CHINKS!!!!
831 2018-11-28 17:54:21 Todays  gain $4683.58 

Compound dividends and stocks price rise. Reinvesting dividends adds up very quickly. Dividends of over 10% annually paid monthly were paid out on Funds like my example of AWP Aberdeen Global Premier Properties Fund paid today. Due your due diligence.

835 2018-11-28 17:52:14 The news predicts a blue wave running up to the election.  Then stocks begin to drop as the election nears.  Seems pretty clear blue wave = economic fear and uncertainty.  The potential return to the crippling regulation @realDonaldTrump  removed. Hrmm

844 2018-11-28 17:50:02 I liked, and enjoyed Powell's speech that just finished a short while ago; not saying it was positive or negative for stocks, economy, or the country.  He spoke well and seemed to want to teach the population.  I felt like I was in a class. .  I was amused too.  No surprises.
845 2018-11-28 17:49:37 So Trump threatens to pull subsidies from GM causing stocks to drop. Also, does he realize pulling subsidies will only increase the 14,000 layoffs? Not very smart. #gmlayoffs #trumpeconimics

848 2018-11-28 17:48:50 I see the bull case on AMLO as: he doesn't do any of these things, or he doesn't do them with nearly the intensity of commitment as he suggests he will. And for stocks to have the "tremendous" recovery you suggest, that would require that the bull case become reality.
849 2018-11-28 17:48:46 God he is a narcissist. He just can't get over himself. BY the way stocks are much higher with Trump than it was with you. Damn dems lack math skills.
850 2018-11-28 17:48:28 Using only Xmas related GIFs, describe how your stocks/cryptos are performing today.
851 2018-11-28 17:48:20 I hear the public square stocks are making a comback. 
And dunking booths? Not just for carnivals anymore!
852 2018-11-28 17:48:15 Not relative to stocks, @HedgehogTrader. Can we call them "bubble stocks"?
853 2018-11-28 17:48:10 have you tried buying stocks everybody else is buying?
854 2018-11-28 17:48:06 If you own any stocks that are down on a day like this i would highly advise dumping them - any stock that is not rallying on a day like this should be highly avoided. Even $GE is up
855 2018-11-28 17:47:35 Like the WSJ experiment of tossing darts at a list of stocks
856 2018-11-28 17:47:31 #MarketUpdate: OFFICIAL! Bearish Trend Persists. stocks down 0.48%  with 12Gainers against 23Decliners.

Nigerian #Stocks sustain losing streak as investors remain wary while @nsenigeria sets to breach 31,000bpts. Yr 2018 loss may hit 22% to close below 30,000bpts.

Be cautious!
857 2018-11-28 17:47:07 12:17 PM : Powell also said that he thinks valuations of Stocks are within historical benchmarks and he focused on financial stability.  This put the Stock market in rally mode.  Bonds too are moving higher, on the 'just below' neutral rate comments. via @mbsHighway
858 2018-11-28 17:47:00 Wall Street Instant Update; at halftime #Stocks react positively to Fed head remarks with the Dow up 475, Nasdaq up 138, S&P up 41
859 2018-11-28 17:46:52 all it took was a little wobble in stocks
860 2018-11-28 17:46:27 If stocks go back up they'll sell gold and buy stocks.  Trump will impose new tariffs so that's prob bearish for gold.
861 2018-11-28 17:46:06 I'm going to start comparing the Stock market to other things and how things work. Let's start by Politics we have Left and Right Wing The battle between the Bulls and the bears. #Blockchain #iot #Bulls #Bears #America #AmeriCAN #Stocks #money #politics #USA
862 2018-11-28 17:46:05 #Stocks are looking for any reason to rally
863 2018-11-28 17:45:10 will defer to you guys, but from where i sit you have to be pretty bearish on stocks and the U.S. economy at these levels to see much upside in EDZ8/9 flattening here....
864 2018-11-28 17:44:43 @realDonaldTrump gets his WALL and drives U.S. taxpayers $Trillions more into debt but stocks will go to never seen before valuations...

866 2018-11-28 17:44:22 Fed Chairman Jerome Powell just said  that the central bank's benchmark interest rate is "just below" neutral. i.e. Fed needs to raise rates only just -so much as to get to neutral. Major positive for market if the rate hike stops! #investing #interesting #stocks
867 2018-11-28 17:43:43 I am FAR from a Trump supporter, but after accepting tarp monies and restructuring and then taking the tax cuts and buying back stocks? I have ZERO sympathy for the fallout and negative consequences of this. My first car was a GM product. However, I will not buy one again.
868 2018-11-28 17:43:12 Eventful night. Powell suggests US interest rates are close to neutral, driving a big rally in stock, plus our 6wk old baby slept through the night. NZX likely to get some good support today, particularly growth stocks like ATM I would think.
869 2018-11-28 17:43:10 Stocks didn't do a DAM thing when he was in office, they didn't grow until Pres Trump took office. What a MORON
870 2018-11-28 17:42:56 30 lousy "industrial" stocks like McDonald's Restaurants too often cited that don't tell you much.
871 2018-11-28 17:40:55 Sagicor and Scotia potential merger discussion. Hmmm. Always good to buy these stocks before the speculation begins. It’s always more expensive after the fact. NCBFG and PJAM are good enough for me in finance.
872 2018-11-28 17:40:49 I don't see the need for bump stocks outside of shooting ranges. Of course I feel bad when mass shootings happen. Nobody wants to see that happen. Especially responsible gun owners.
873 2018-11-28 17:40:20 Not really. Stocks are at a 9-year low. We're priced for something very bad to happen. And thinking he might at least "respect institutions" is scarcely bullish. If we're really priced for him to disrespect institutions, which you imply  we are, then I'd be bullish on Mexico.
874 2018-11-28 17:40:06 If you kept people upto date on Twitter/ Facebook about what’s happening / what stocks arrived and going out. Your phone calls will be half and it will only take 5 minutes of your time...
875 2018-11-28 17:39:44 No, but those jobs won't be available until 2021 at the earliest, that's if Steel Dynamic stocks dropping doesn't scrap the plan.
876 2018-11-28 17:39:42 <Looks at cheat sheet> 
I think 60/40 stocks bonds is good for you. I only charge 1% of assets.
877 2018-11-28 17:38:57 Trump has now influenced the fed which is supposed to be an independent agency. Stocks will rise now, but we have no protection from asset bubbles, overheated markets, and fewer tools to deal with a recession later. He’s endangered the ability to deal with future economic crises.
878 2018-11-28 17:38:53 The real reason is  that you eliminated increasing the MPG average in order for oil companies to sell more gasoline. The other reasons are the tariffs  and big business bought their stocks back with all that tax credit money you provided them .
879 2018-11-28 17:38:53 "I said, 'Have you checked where your stocks were when I came into office and where they are now?'" Obama said, adding, "'What are you complaining about? Just say thank you, please.'"
880 2018-11-28 17:38:26 Lovely, fully positioned for bounce. And Powell throws gasoline on the upswing,Short squeezimatic. Loaded on $FAANG & didn’t listen to so smart naysayers. These stocks have been on 5 yr perfect marches up. Garden variety pullback 20+ for $Faang. Got all to move over, slow growth?

882 2018-11-28 17:38:22 Stocks rip higher, Dow surges 450 points after Fed Chair Powell signals rates are near neutral - CNBC
883 2018-11-28 17:38:17 Yes, stocks will go up when you pump 100 billion a month into the economy for years, benefiting Wall St but not quite so much the blue collar class whom you claim to represent.
884 2018-11-28 17:37:51 U.S. stocks in early afternoon Wednesday 11/28/2018. $DJIA +1.82% at 25.199.16, $SPX +1.46% at 2,721.22, $COMPQ +1.88% at 7,215.86, $RUT +1.54% at $1515.86.
885 2018-11-28 17:37:43 Just like they priced in all the expected company earnings from last quarter . And  when companies one by one came out and announced they did not meet or exceed those earning expectations and slashed their future earnings forecast then stocks dropped dramatically.
886 2018-11-28 17:37:42 construction won't begin till 2020 and won't be spent until 2021 stocks dropped 9%
887 2018-11-28 17:37:26 sounds like 100% the opposite of what he's been saying for awhile. What a dramatic & sudden shift bcs stocks had dropped (yet no where near what global mrkts have done YTD). The US may have a special sickness no one else does and obsession on saving equities above all else
888 2018-11-28 17:37:01 U.S. stocks rose higher on Wednesday after Federal Reserve  Chairman Jerome Powell said that the gradual interest-rate hikes are  meant to balance risks as it tries to keep the economy on track.

890 2018-11-28 17:36:39 Stocks Spike, Dollar Yields Drop on Powell

The reaction to Powell's speech is dovish, with yields and the dollar spiking lower while S&P 500 jumps to high of day.

896 2018-11-28 17:35:16 On the same day Draghi announces ECB QE to end and Powell announces FED rate hikes to end. Gold at multi-year lows relative to stocks. If ever there was a time to be long metals, it's now.
897 2018-11-28 17:34:57 Curb your enthusiasm. Buying stocks while the $SPX is still below it's 200day moving average is reckless. I'll wait.

913 2018-11-28 17:29:32 #BREAKING on @OANN: U.S. stocks go soaring after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell suggests the central bank could be slowing down the pace of its recent interest rate hikes, saying rates are now slightly below what he considers to be a “neutral” level. #OANN
914 2018-11-28 17:29:30 Stocks add to gains on the "just below neutral" text from Powell. Dow +350 points.

919 2018-11-28 17:28:14 This AM the Fed said stocks can be high priced and global issues can cause higher volatility. At midday, Fed chair Powell said strong Econ still and that rates are near neutral. Signals chance for fewer rate hikes 2019. Investors bought the news.

946 2018-11-28 17:20:12 Powell nugget care of @pboockvar who notes two words “just under” implies one and done in December. Powell “did talk about the risks in corporate bond land but doesn’t believe it creates a ‘systemic threat.’ He thinks the valuations of stocks are within historical benchmarks.”

I’m at ECNY covering the event.
987 2018-11-28 17:09:30 No it isn't. Inflated stocks along with the largest amount of corporate debt for the companies that those stocks represent lead to a stock market crash.  That leads to QE 4.

1010 2018-11-28 17:03:01 Well, forget Powell’s speech pouring cold water on future rate hikes. His speech does slip in a ‘no irrational exuberance’ clause in equities which will likely help stocks...for about the next 30 minutes. Short this rally.

Remaining cautious until trend shifts. Enjoy the ride!

1035 2018-11-28 16:54:44 Try using the word "specialists." They have a seat on the exchange and a duty to maintain an orderly market. They control the price, but in turn must buy when there are sellors. So to unload stocks bought, they raise prices to unload them.This accounts for unexplained price lifts

1058 2018-11-28 16:48:05 what about current $IAN cash position? i believe we can all agree on an upcoming raise. the stocks mentioned are fully cashed up vs IAN.

But yes, i fully agree IAN is way cheaper than most big multistate operators.
1059 2018-11-28 16:47:59 So the current way to overcome this is to subscribe the stocks only at the exit time. But this causes complexity in the option terms.

1062 2018-11-28 16:46:49 I think the most important caveat is that options are taxed with current valuation when the stocks are subscribed, even if they are not liquid, and in many cases nobody makes any money out of them at any time.

1067 2018-11-28 16:46:05 Your words, not mine- chasing stocks 15% higher than where they were likely bought 2-3 months prior is not very wise; blindly chasing stale 13-Fs in general not very smart, especially in tech where things move/change rapidly

1125 2018-11-28 16:24:23 STEEL INDUSTRY STOCKS ARE IN THE TOILET. President Trump has been able to find one steel company which is expanding slightly (only 600 workers) while all the others are laying off and decreasing production because of Trump's backfiring tariffs. "He's a moron" said one executive.

1132 2018-11-28 16:22:19 what are you talking about?  crypto barely existed in 2009. and you very easily could've bought better bottoms in both stocks and real estate in 2009.  you're saying in 3-5 years it's going to be worse than this great "crash" that was diff in 2009?
1133 2018-11-28 16:21:50 The same stocks/sectors that people said to ignore when the markets were down are now pointing them out as a reason for the market to go higher now that they’re up
1134 2018-11-28 16:21:34 Well said...seeing few ppl like U on Twitter is inspiring to do our own research and take trade ...just wanted to know how do stocks come on your radar in which u take positions??is it system generated or U search for stocks manually??

1136 2018-11-28 16:20:13 For reporters covering the small refiner exemption issue, just a reminder: With record RIN stocks and RIN prices currently trading for less than a dime, there is no way a refiner could claim that compliance with the #RFS is somehow causing economic harm.

1159 2018-11-28 16:12:45 @FoxNews  Seems that selling stocks in a co. like GM would drive prices up for the consumer . Not Good .
1160 2018-11-28 16:12:18 GM is cutting jobs in the states. The president called them out. Their stocks dropped. I don’t see a problem
1161 2018-11-28 16:11:28 OK, Finally found ONE thing I disagree with the President on....!!!

Interest rates needed to tick up just a tad. They had been artificially low for too long.

Borrowing cheap money, to invest in housing, or stocks, over inflates the markets, and produces dangerous "Bubbles".
1162 2018-11-28 16:11:27 This clown has no shame. Stocks rose because the feds started printing money, called it quantitative easing and shoved most of it into the stock market.
1163 2018-11-28 16:11:27 So I think, we don't need n number of stocks or calls to make money, if we concentrate on only few, we can make good money.

1183 2018-11-28 16:05:03 My take.
1. before you enter know who's territory you are in (bull/bears) don't enter to enter and hope (People pulling out before the market corrects itself is how you lose money.Hold on to your stocks and wait for the bull)

1190 2018-11-28 16:02:53 It speaks to anyone practicing proper risk management. If you are that nervous about price in such short time frames then you are probably over extending yourself.

1197 2018-11-28 15:59:03 Agree... very different picture but at the end of day, stocks are stocks and worldwide, nothing really seems to be building.  Stocks as a whole just holding flat and that's without this OPEC cut and Iran just now starting to come into stats.

1241 2018-11-28 15:42:51 The elected officials appoint people to run union pensions. Those people invest pension money into stocks of their elitist friends who rig the market and steal the money. That’s why pensions are collapsing all over and they expect taxpayers to bail them out.

$NIO bought back the puts for a nice  profit. Looking to sell calls on it today that I covered 2 days ago.  Love the premiums on this stock. Giving almost 15%(was 20%) of the stock price for a straddle.  Theoretically could own the stocks for free after 5 months.

1249 2018-11-28 15:40:55 The US government decided to buy shares instead of giving GM a loan so the auto sector remained alive, and it didn't lead to a full recession. 

The reason the money is still owed is because the stocks have never increased enough to gain back the profits.

But that would eventually lead to a sell off regardless.  However b/c of a run-up already, not much

1280 2018-11-28 15:32:38 David, do you know yet how #Brexit is benefiting Scotland ? Seemingly, Scots import a lot of Cod & Haddock from EU (favoured fish  Iin U.K. 80% approx) Other Scottish fish stocks exported to EU. So benefits? 
1281 2018-11-28 15:32:28 What an ignorant statement! Investing in our economy does not mean simply buying stocks. People who have jobs and don't purchase stock, are still 'invested'. Our whole economy depends upon companies, and therefore employees, being successful mostly without govt intervention.

1344 2018-11-28 15:15:26 The GDP, although the best indicator of the economy overall, it is not the entire picture. Our economy is based on debt. Government debt is huge compared to GDP & consumer debt is at all all time high. This will become a “debt bubble” just like the “tech bubble”. Look at stocks.

1350 2018-11-28 15:14:04 My gut instinct is telling me that the bear market still has a long way to go. I feel like everything is still overvalued (at the moment) including stocks.

1362 2018-11-28 15:09:31 Stocks have been a mercurial mess this year. Lots of economists believe we’re headed for a massive blow 
1363 2018-11-28 15:09:06 It’s also a bit misleading though, I doubt the majority of the people who picked the losing stocks are still holding them. My portfolio is completely different to how it was at the start of the year.
1364 2018-11-28 15:08:49 @Stash why was i charged $1 and $10 to sell my stocks, didn’t say anything about you taking money out of my account

1375 2018-11-28 15:02:33 The fact that hedge funds have been failing was a good counter to today's claim that "because more stocks are beating the average means indexers will under perform." 

Indexers will ALWAYS outperform the average by a little bit thanks to cost savings. Year after year that adds up

1387 2018-11-28 15:00:16 Yeah, but not only that, the companies too. If you go on Google and search for "ea stocks" it will give the option of the last 5 years. You will see the biggest companies grew more than 200%. That's where the idea came from

1393 2018-11-28 14:59:08 They don’t technically owe that money just to clarify. The problem with the Loan being “satisfied” is that they paid it with a mix of cash and stocks. But the stocks weren’t worth what was needed to pay it in full.

1416 2018-11-28 14:50:47 The broad pullback has relieved a good deal of valuation pressure on stocks, via @LeutholdGroup: "Median trailing P/E ratio across the Leuthold 3000 has fallen 6.5 points in just ten months to 18.5x, lowest reading since January 2013, only half a point above its 33-year median."

1488 2018-11-28 14:23:16 Adani gas hit 52 Wk-H last Week. Almost all Adani group Stocks has touched 52 Wk-H (Adani Enterprises, Adani green Energy) in 2018.
1489 2018-11-28 14:23:13 You should've picked warioware
The stage is interesting and cool 
You keep on losing stocks 
Cause blastzones are small 
But honestly 
That's ok
1490 2018-11-28 14:23:12 Workers buy shares (directly,or indirectly)=shareholders.
Why would someone owe you more than you both agreed the job is worth (salary)? You want to own the company, instead of down payment for home/car buy co bonds/stocks.
1491 2018-11-28 14:23:12 Stocks futures are pointing to a higher Wall Street open and a third straight day of gains for the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq.
1492 2018-11-28 14:22:27 3000 stocks are 20% or more off their 52 week high. Those stocks are bearish.
1493 2018-11-28 14:21:45 Why MPs hate May's Brexit deal – and why the P M says they’re wrong: J DOYLE explains what could happen next. British fleet couldn't handle the entire catch? Bloody idiots that's their fault for causing the dilapidation but it will help stocks recover anyway, so who cares?

1495 2018-11-28 14:20:51 GM stocks can free fall today and lose more than 50% of their values. Trump just doesn't care..
1496 2018-11-28 14:20:39 remember this, so many stocks have VERY bad monthly chart set-up with two huge red candles into December AND 5ma either already or about to dead cross 10ma on monthly, meaning technically there's a chance see huge dip back to monthly mid BB again some time in December. know this.
1497 2018-11-28 14:20:35 Jared given your focus on inequality, it's useful to consider that loose Fed policy is a driver of inequalty through asset price increases (stocks, housing, commodities), helping debtors over savers, &bigger finance industry. Reverse should be true; tighter Fed = less inequality
1498 2018-11-28 14:19:50 you should try robinhood in the future. its commission free but a lot of penny stocks are not available on it

1501 2018-11-28 14:19:25 Delaying is one thing & some Investors analyse like movie critics mainly focus on mistakes of the company (whereas common audience see both right & wrong side + enjoy the movie)

1502 2018-11-28 14:19:13 Dont know why you are saying stocks are ok my 401 has lost 8% in the past 5 weeks. I do not understand why you keep bringing Obama or Hillary into every conversation. They are gone!  GM & HD are the start. I've seen this movie before..The ending sucks for us.

1505 2018-11-28 14:18:11 While stocks have enjoyed a slight bounce in the last couple of days it’s interesting to see that the 10 year US Treasury yield has been flirting with lows not seen since mid-Sept

1507 2018-11-28 14:17:11 Of course Trump’s tax cuts and GM buying back $10b of stocks while making a $4b profit has nothing to do with it.
1508 2018-11-28 14:17:07 Yes a lot more in the Tarriff pre purchase  sugar fix than many realise. Just wait for the Sugar fix hangover through 2019 as it is realised stocks already purchased for 12 months plus, both import and export where it was thought to be affected by Tarrifs. December figures start.

1543 2018-11-28 14:01:41 You talk about the market crashing while at the same time saying Bitcoin has rebounded from many crashes itself. The difference is there are tangible assets behind stocks, and nothing behind Bitcoin.

1550 2018-11-28 13:59:54 GM cuts 15% of salaried workers and stocks go up 6%. Trump Tweets a threat to GM and stocks go down 2.6%.  Cool economy we've made here, United States.
1551 2018-11-28 13:59:51 20 stocks at what price?

Your returns will be pocket change until you're getting over 100% return at $20,000.

Until then it's just comfortable money that comes from an inconsistent income.
1552 2018-11-28 13:58:48 US stocks are threatening the end of the bull market, and for that reason I am 50% in cash. But we are not yet in a Bear market. Bitcoin and Cryptos entered a Bear market 11 months ago and I have been 100% in cash since Jan.
1553 2018-11-28 13:57:35 I would wager very few Vanguard investors regard factor investing relevant. Its a hard sell to people who buy basically all stocks and all bonds and just play with the ratio.
1554 2018-11-28 13:57:26 FACTS: Obama created more jobs in his last 17 months in office than Trump did in his first 17 months.  Unemployment is an extension of the previous 6 years of growth.  Stocks are down for the YEAR,, Obama never had that.  Trump had 4 casinos, an air line, & a University all fail.
1555 2018-11-28 13:57:24 Actually, the NRA came out AGAINST bump stocks when Trump wanted to make them illegal. Again, you don’t know the basics. You’re just spewing talking points that are based on emotion, not fact.

1557 2018-11-28 13:56:49 "Governments buy stocks when they plunge."?

1558 2018-11-28 13:56:47 "We have to raise our prices to keep up with the costs of operation," they say as profits and stocks skyrocket disproportionately.

1570 2018-11-28 13:48:54 Holding stocks for the long term that are fundamentally sound is probably the least risky option.

1595 2018-11-28 13:33:11 So here is a question for all the trump  supporters. How do y'all like all the winning? GM firing 17,000 employees closing 5 plants all due to trump and his tariffs. Oh not to mention stocks falling. Ya y'all r really winning ain't ya.

1605 2018-11-28 13:29:21 so my initial parsing of the headlines this morning suggests that stocks have sold off & GM is cutting jobs because the President's gut instinct to select a taller-than-Yellen Fed candidate may have been misguided

1611 2018-11-28 13:25:02 Incredibly tired of these articles about the housing market. Home values continue to increase (beating #stocks and #bonds this year), #banks are lending, and interest rates are still low (though not relative to all time lows). It’s “tough” by no reasonable standard. #RealEstate
1612 2018-11-28 13:24:32 @5280ruckus maybe this is our next shot to buy cheap GM stocks.

1614 2018-11-28 13:23:30 The -PNA is fantasyland for any duration, too many other players at work. Yes low stocks will keep this market bid all winter near 4. Just look at last winter with the demand when we were in the 3's, aka less coal ect

1629 2018-11-28 13:12:53 That’s why villages used to put people in the stocks and throw rotten vegetables at them. I’d like to think we’d moved on from that mentality. The US has the death penalty but that hasn’t brought down the murder rate. Shaming one person does not stop them hurting others.

1634 2018-11-28 13:09:20 Yes I agree.
Of course we will offer (sell) quota rights over parts of our waters and fish stocks... but we DO NOT need the EU to work with us toachieve that; they’ll get what they’re given after our assessment of various factors.

1636 2018-11-28 13:06:16 Realty stocks declined. Indiabulls Real Estate (down 4.21%), Sunteck  Realty (down 3.35%), Godrej Properties (down 5.07%), D B Realty (down  4.06%), DLF (down 1.15%), Housing Development and Infrastructure (HDIL)  (down 3.54%),
1637 2018-11-28 13:05:59 That's an interesting thought. I too have wondered if Trump will make him the fall guy if stocks crash. Trump has certainly distanced himself and laid the foundation for the Fed being "at fault."
1638 2018-11-28 13:05:51 IT stocks gained. TCS (up 4.67%), Infosys (up 4.61%), HCL Technologies  (up 1.7%), Oracle Financial Services Software (up 1.43%), Tech Mahindra  (up 0.69%), MindTree (up 5.95%), Hexaware Technologies (up 1.06%) and  Mphasis (up 5.34%) edged higher. Wipro (down 0.48%) fell.

1642 2018-11-28 13:04:30 To all those who believe a US/ China trade deal is about to unfold... the currency markets are the largest, most liquid markets out there. As such they "get it" long before stocks. Which is why the fact the $USD is UP, not DOWN, tells us this narrative is total BS
1643 2018-11-28 13:04:22 Nifty  500 stocks advance decline ratio was 1:2. Both Mid-cap and small cap  Indexs declined over half percent each. Both Tech and Media stocks were major gainers while Metal, Pharma, OMCs, PSU Banks and  Auto stocks declined. Tech stocks were biggest gainers today.
1644 2018-11-28 13:04:12 This is why the Government should Never Ever be in Business.....without our (taxpayer) approval.

1672 2018-11-28 12:45:55 The wealth gap is not because of some notion of not electing to buy real estate or stocks, but rather it is rooted in structural systems of giving whites government subsidy for centuries, to build wealth starting with real estate.
1673 2018-11-28 12:45:25 noo, please dont avoid those stocks, its not the fault of stocks but maybe the fault of the price action you were trading into. so avoid the price action you were trading into, not the stocks.

1679 2018-11-28 12:43:11 Perhaps we can look at the economic disaster caused in NL by the mismanagement of the fish stocks. Is this the blues economy created here? loss of 40,000 people and closure of communities in rural NL? #cdnpoli
1680 2018-11-28 12:43:09 The market is buying stocks before Powell.
1681 2018-11-28 12:42:44 Being in the EU meant we could fish in a much larger area and sell quickly and cheaply to a much larger market. It also protected fish stocks which were close to depletion in the North Sea thanks to British fishermen. But if you’d rather listen to a bullshitter like Farage, fine

1692 2018-11-28 12:36:40 It feels like you have misunderstood my meaning. In response to K-AP's comments: The POTUS takes the credit when a company like GM hires more people, but when they fire people he takes no blame at all." In fact you could apply this to lots of things; gas prices, stocks.

1698 2018-11-28 12:32:55 There’s no manipulation. The weakest names are stocks that are down YTD and i assume are being hit by tax loss selling. There are sellers on them, i dont see how that’s “manipulation”
1699 2018-11-28 12:32:38 So if you had $500k to invest, your whole life's savings, would you put it all in one bond, or a couple of hundred large stocks in a large cap fund?  In a bad bear you might lose 40% in the fund and recover in a few years.  Someone messes up at AT&T and you lose all forever.

Now if she has two businesses, investment  properties, stocks, and a profession, then it will be a different response. I am not here to judge. I am trying to overcome the same obstacles.

1742 2018-11-28 12:09:35 As soon as @realDonaldTrump started threatening @GM he knew the stocks would plumit. So @POTUS "SHORTED" the stock and made millions on that deal. Anytime he runs his mouth about a company one way or another #trump makes money.

1751 2018-11-28 12:07:00 You need to shut up about things you know nothing about. GM lost 1.6 bn due to Trump's tariffs. Every big company who got a tax windfall took the money, bought back stocks, and lined their own pockets. What do you expect from a morally and fiscally irresponsible orange idiot?
1752 2018-11-28 12:06:48 @RickRutkowski Nice find, I didn't realize that, but that makes what Trump is tweeting all the more insane. Per CNBC, Trump is proposing the gov't cut all GM subsidies because of their announcement. GM stocks plunged. Probably sucks to be a GM line worker this morning with a 1/

A quick question: Is investing (in US stocks) enabled in any country? I'm living in Greece and the option is still showing "coming soon". Do you have any expecting time to share?
1774 2018-11-28 11:49:51 Stocks!?
1775 2018-11-28 11:49:27 That being the case, then we can look forward to booms n busts same as with so many other regulated asset classes; tech stocks, oil, credit, metals. In crypto I've heard it said "shark's teeth"--BTC up to 20k, down to 3k, back up to 30k, down to 5k. Gonna need balls of steel, ha.
1776 2018-11-28 11:47:21 All your stocks are sold at 30% discount but your price is still 50% more than every other vendor even with your discount.
1777 2018-11-28 11:46:29 thing is, the death penalty is just a holdover from the days when stocks in village squares where common, but knocking crims off scooters is a direct and nesesery response to a problem that i cant see being solved any other way.
1778 2018-11-28 11:46:08 The easy money GM got from hard working Americans is ignored and were is UAW they got huge numbers of stocks from the GM bailout. Where is UAW a key stockholder in protecting US workers?
1779 2018-11-28 11:45:47 Too many clever people, not enough good people running the show. It takes a RC to make 'these people' stand back and ponder wtf they are doing and what consequences their behaviours have on individuals, society and the economy.

1786 2018-11-28 11:39:24 “The stock market” does not exist. If you are an investor, you’d know that you invest in different stocks that change in their own time. There is no such thing as an overall stock market. I use the Dow Jones because it is the group that has the most stocks for accurate data.

1789 2018-11-28 11:34:30 Patience is one very important aspect. But the examples of Apple , Amazon cited are very inappropriate. In this context stocks like HUL, Reliance, L&T which went through various cycles in last 20 years would hv been better case study. Those who remained invested made it big.

1801 2018-11-28 11:23:05 Irony: if by some set of circumstances we end up either staying in EU or worse - EEA/Norway - then Conservative government will have failed so badly to deliver Brexit that it surely will usher in a Labour govt.

1834 2018-11-28 10:48:02 maybe AAA didn't know that the trophies they ordered had a promo  where if you buy 1, you get 1 free so now they're just trying to get rid of the extra stocks

1836 2018-11-28 10:44:52 Even Deepak Nitrite is down. Bepl fundamentals are intact. But one technical guy on Bloomberg quint predicted yesterday that it’s likely to go down to 70 n maybe more. But it’s a temporary thing and happens in all stocks. If invested for long term quit seeing prices daily.

1839 2018-11-28 10:42:14 I really feel for some retail investors who trusted these so called gems, so called stable stocks and so called bluechips. 2018 has been an year to forget. Hopefully 2019 will make us more disciplined.

1868 2018-11-28 10:21:06 The disruption of Kodak's business was decades in the making (evolution). Disruption = result. Evolution = process. Every promoter uses superlatives. Purchases of stocks/goods/services based on superlatives alone are inherently risky. Anyway, as you were...

1870 2018-11-28 10:20:32 This projection is far from facts on ground, farm yields for the raining season are still high despite the flood in some States, and surprisingly many of the processing plants still have large stocks of both paddy and rice awaiting process or evacuation.

         what is the solution?

1943 2018-11-28 09:19:22 Of course you'll blame the EU. It's easy and everyone's doing it. The LSE article explains factors impacting size of fleets. Tech advances = larger ships with fewer crew + management policy that is actually working well to improve stocks. Your argument with with capitalism.

1950 2018-11-28 09:11:51 Yes, but the reason it is so expensive is that stocks are very endangered and need time to get re-established. But unlike other Europeans, we don’t have the knowledge of other fish/seafood and how to cook them.

regardless of what it is, even if it’s penny stocks. profit is profit. learning the ins and outs of how it works and one day hoping to master it, is the fun part.

2239 2018-11-28 05:00:29 Value funds find stocks that are cheap compared to fair value.  This often means they are turn- around plays.  Small companies do not have a lot of room to fall before they need to close the doors.  This is a risky fund.
2240 2018-11-28 04:59:28 I've been pretty busy today, but looking at after-market trading, many stocks are looking up -- apparently there is still hope for a trade deal with China. I advise caution if this recent "rally" is based on these hopes - things could change for the worst very quickly #investing

2245 2018-11-28 04:55:40 What should happen is every company that destroyed its balance sheet to buy back stocks goes bankrupt in the coming recession.

2295 2018-11-28 04:11:20 That's true lower food and fuel cost in the usa due to tariffs on china will keep inflation below the feds 2% target thus precluding interest rate hikes, but danger exist because China's collapsing currency and stocks may force the sale of U.S. treasuries raising interest rates.
2296 2018-11-28 04:10:46 I see what you're doing here, get the stocks to plummet,  so your friends can sweep in and buy them up. Then adjust the tariffs to your advantage.  You're great at bankrupting companies and profiting off of them.

2298 2018-11-28 04:08:28 A few reasons for this: 1) Strong $, 2) Producers forced to hedge a larger portion of production due to debt covenants/requirements & 3) General lack of capital flow that has found its way to stocks instead. This relationship will mean revert back the other way at some point.

2303 2018-11-28 04:03:26 It is not the power that Metronic's has over the government. It is a massive corporation just like Monsanto that should be broken up by anti-trust laws. But won't ever happen because everyone who has a stock portfolio ( everyone in congress?) invest in medical stocks.
2304 2018-11-28 04:02:23 That was a short term trade B. Keep short term and long term independent from one another. I very much like stocks regardless of volatility and tariffs. There's always some headwind. Easy days are nonetheless gone.

2315 2018-11-28 03:54:36 Out of interest, what would the budget be for that many deep holes? Are they all DD? I recall some O&G stocks I followed years ago drilling 1km+ holes and they cost a motza - curious to know what they cost in this context.
2316 2018-11-28 03:53:56 Mostly Dair USmash since spikes are untechable + falling nair to USmash. In my eyes, Pit didn't really need the jank stuff. He needed actual kill potential to close out stocks and consistent hitboxes.

2324 2018-11-28 03:48:31 #GOPtaxScam was used by CEOs (Trump's donors) to buy back stocks & give stock holders higher earnings.  They did what everyone knew they would do.  Trump can pretend to be outraged but HE KNEW what would happen with that money.

2327 2018-11-28 03:47:18 $XJO outside some stocks which are rallying on news seems like a fair bit of indecision today like Wall Street last night. Probably lack of direction until Trump-Xi G20 meeting this weekend.
2328 2018-11-28 03:46:35 Their promotion says "Tokenization is the process of digitizing private securities that previously existed only on paper,". 

Weird. I have not had paper certificates for the stocks I have owned for the last couple of decades. I wonder which securities exist only on paper.

2330 2018-11-28 03:45:56 Lol ,  why MF  weightage in Auto stocks fell 14% vs 17% fall in Auto Index ? . Means they increased their sharecount by 3%. . IT Index rallied over 20% but allocation went up 15%. Means they sold IT to buy Auto na ?

2342 2018-11-28 03:39:24 Its good to throw numbers just like that. You extrapolate this & that, then 150x is shoved as reasonable? If so, CEO compensation can be 149x median worker pay. That's my counter offer because your proposal is damn too high. #salary #wagegap #wages #stocks

2347 2018-11-28 03:38:04 Trump pretends to be shocked when big companies perform just like always & just like he would do............they pocketed the tax breaks & bought back stocks......always working to maximize stock holder earnings.  @realDonaldTrump is an idiot.  @GOP are just increasing the debt.

2369 2018-11-28 03:20:49 Mexican Stocks are priced for AMLO to be a despicable and irresponsible tyrant. Although if markets keep tanking the risk will increase that AMLO responds by uniting the people in a sense of grievance against international capital markets. Source Bloomberg
2370 2018-11-28 03:20:39 Exactly. Many of us don’t have stocks and retirement. Those of us actually struggling. I just get angry with the talk about that, as if we don’t matter when we pay taxes too, sometimes at a much higher percentage.
2371 2018-11-28 03:20:39 That’s what happens when you let predetermined plan drive decisions. Fed should be acting based on real-time data, which they’ll be forced to when the one piece of data they actually care about drops 20-30 percent more #stocks
2372 2018-11-28 03:20:33 Conservatives are big supporters of capitalism and the rich getting richer.  GM stocks were up yesterday after the news of the closings.  Shareholders getting richer,no doubt the CEO & others will get bonuses for rising shares.  #CPC does not care about the workers.
2373 2018-11-28 03:19:41 Well the psychological wage ain’t paying well. They will die. To put a fine point on it: I am a Black man, with an investment portfolio of stocks in companies that kill these people; drug companies, tobacco, defense, you name it.

2378 2018-11-28 03:16:43 I'm NOT against banning them. They were used in ONE shooting that we know of, and the reality is that a trained shooter with the firepower (sans bump stocks) would have had a much higher casualty count in the same scenario. It's just 'feel good' legislation.

2386 2018-11-28 03:07:56 Are you confusing semi-automatics with automatics? Or are you inferring that bump stocks do anything other than decrease accuracy AND reliability?
2387 2018-11-28 03:07:34 I think he's making an analogy to stocks? Public company w/ 40% public float, so 60% is held by directors, officers, large investors. But marketcap is still computed as 100% outstanding shares x price/share. Not saying XRP is like a share/stock but that's how I understood him.
2388 2018-11-28 03:06:35 Whatever happens in the broader longer term context stocks are still very much runnable if the story is right.

2393 2018-11-28 03:02:32 why I shouldnt? I am not mentally ill. Is that what you are trying to point out?  NO I am making a case on why SOME should be banned and have stricter laws on who can get them. Ban bump stocks. What is wrong with that? WHY are you so afraid of it?
2394 2018-11-28 03:02:25 I heard it before. I think it’s law. But don’t you think maybe these applies to traditional stocks and bonds , more than cryptos? I have confidence in EOS ,maybe eth & btc. Not to sure about the rest of them. Do you have a top 5 or 10?

2407 2018-11-28 02:52:47 Well, you're assuming we want to raise taxes on people making less than $5 million a year. Your income bracket would see tax cuts in my world. Are you happy that corporations pay 14% less than you? I'm not. Especially when all they've done with it is buy back their own stocks.

2415 2018-11-28 02:47:54 You gonna buy so much from those investments  Why don't you have investment workshops like your cohost tho? No weed stocks?
2416 2018-11-28 02:47:15 When a company buy back stocks it’s like them paying off a credit card. More earnings they get to keep to use for employees and to make capital improvements with.
2417 2018-11-28 02:45:27 +5% seems too arbitrary. However this year, for every asset class, risk-adj return has been horrible. One feature to blame is Trump's strategy to throw silly policies when stocks are up and quasi-capitulate on the plan on mkt panic (squashes price range + spikes volatility).

2421 2018-11-28 02:40:51 Red Bull would be a large mature company, much less potential. Look for stocks with New Products or New "things".  Sometimes a new thing will have bad Sales/EPS, like TSLA or FSLR back in the day.  "New" is very important

2423 2018-11-28 02:40:10 How rich. They fully supported the tax cuts that caused things like this to happen. Corporations bought their stocks back instead of investing in employees. Corps weren't ever going to invest in their employees. They literally enabled their own job losses.

2427 2018-11-28 02:38:40 Market reality:

If USD sustains strength, and US stock prices are high, global economics may sideline US Equity stocks as US exports are too expensive against their currency near term.

This will escalate inflation on weakening economies globally
2428 2018-11-28 02:37:56 But you’re happy when they prop them up with billions...? Guess you’re more pissed about your stocks dipping....
2429 2018-11-28 02:37:41 Hey @NFL players you want finance advice take 75 percent of your money , use 50 % leveraged 5 to one mid 2 to 5 year term AAA bonds , other fifty percent close your eyes and buy 150 stocks equally on SP500, dont touch it  #5minportfolio @washingtonpost @nytimes @NateSilver538
2430 2018-11-28 02:36:16 $AAPL Today served as a good example as to why I've been posting NOT make this your primary focus. Other good trades/stocks can get missed.
2431 2018-11-28 02:35:19 The tax breaks were used to buy back their stocks. From the start this is what Dems were warning about, it was never about helping the middle class or creating jobs, always about lining the pockets of the already rich. Sorry this is just now sinking in with you.
2432 2018-11-28 02:33:04 Stop spending so more money and start investing into stocks!!!
2433 2018-11-28 02:32:41 scrooggggg I missed you!!!!! lmaooo  I thought you were switching back to stocks my love
2434 2018-11-28 02:32:18 Yes I remember shorts kept attacking it. You had TASR during that time too I believe. AAPL was the big liquid leader during those days. Its true though not many momentum stocks like we have in this bull market.
2435 2018-11-28 02:30:22 omg never forget. i hope your mom still stocks up for me just in case
2436 2018-11-28 02:29:42 Not possible. Gsecs are still barely used by retail investors. U can check weekly rbi report. This kite issue happens at least 10 times each year. Any other good discount brokers guys?
2437 2018-11-28 02:27:40 If IVF then embryo selection would solve that problem. Or we would just have more people taking lifetime CRISPR drugs (buy CRISPR stocks now). Only other alternative is to edit embryos.
2438 2018-11-28 02:26:19 @latha_venkatesh @_anujsinghal

Hi, The prompter showed all wrong prices for bull eye participants stocks and prices this morning. Hope there is accountability there.  V guard, jubilant are some examples.
2439 2018-11-28 02:25:41 ...Lies about how tariffs work, success of immagrant labor, higher stocks equaling better economy.

Identity politics: religion is fake news, also what makes people from different countries different. Fake sciences like phrenology further divides.

Just some examples.
2440 2018-11-28 02:23:29 Since 1980s, corps abandoned corp responsibility+made share price ONLY goal, cutting wages, investment+moving overseas. Congress didn't reform tax code to incentivize investment+ON-SHORING  jobs. 80% of us only own 7% of stocks. Market inversely beneficial to most.
2441 2018-11-28 02:23:14 OK and the stock market protects it's investors? 7 years ago all the retirees at my work lost 50% of their retirement due to stocks. It's a joke and it's so annoying there is nothing we can do about it. The GOV are just legal cartels!
2442 2018-11-28 02:22:58 God, he sounds like Woody Allen in Manhattan. “My accountant says that I did this at a very bad time. My stocks are down. I, uh, I-I-I'm cash-poor or something. I got no cash flow. I'm not liquid or, uh, something's not flowing.”
2443 2018-11-28 02:22:40 What other stocks are currently in this 'Parabolic Hyperwave crash'?
2444 2018-11-28 02:22:28 Feels ok. Amazing how a lot of stocks trade in the USA, either all in or all out.

2453 2018-11-28 02:14:12 Well, yeah. It's good to diversify the portfolio, says this person who doesn't buy stocks.
2454 2018-11-28 02:13:50 Government sector stocks seem vulnerable to further declines #NiftyPSE although the #NiftyIT Sector seems to have bottomed out based on last 2 days price action it would also make me feel that #Dollar may start appreciating and #Rupee depreciating, which may weaken the #Nifty
2455 2018-11-28 02:13:49 So buy stocks that pay dividends.
2456 2018-11-28 02:11:55 I read stocks as socks first and was super confused lmao

2459 2018-11-28 02:11:05 Does this tell anything about value in PSE Stocks..?
2460 2018-11-28 02:10:44 They won’t do that. They are in on the scam. Buy stocks after his tweets.
2461 2018-11-28 02:10:43 No muy diferentes "Naturally, much depends on whether the new president turns out to be AM-lovable or AM-scary, but this tumble does have the look of catharsis or revulsion. Stocks are priced for the new president to be a despicable and irresponsible tyrant" solo agregan tiempo

2463 2018-11-28 02:08:15 There are only 2 things in this world that are finite: time and Bitcoin. Everything else can be made more of: dollars, stocks, bonds, fly to other planets and find more gold, you should look into Trace Mayer's 7 Bitcoin network effects it's pretty fascinating.
2464 2018-11-28 02:08:15 I like how they do this right after black Friday gotta clear them stocks of old ones.
2465 2018-11-28 02:07:49 I ran out of peanut butter, my food stocks are almost nil! Help!
2466 2018-11-28 02:07:01 Inverted yield curves can and do precede recessions. Markets form tops, have corrective action without having yield curve inversion. This is healthy for markets long term. It rids it of weak hands and stocks. In near term people let it create pain due to misunderstanding and risk
2467 2018-11-28 02:06:41 Stocks go up and down. Manipulation pushing the stock down. But it's ARTIFICIAL. Price could be moved up just as easy. Its all fake. I know it is difficult to watch your account fluctuate. Appears like FINRA is currently investigating, not to mention the rest of the catalysts.
2468 2018-11-28 02:05:06 Julio Yolo, if you mean BDO Nomura stocks trading account the best is for you to open a BDO Savings Account in any of the Banco De Oro branch near your residence then apply for online banking, once done you can open online for BDO Nomura stocks trading account. Hope it can help.
2469 2018-11-28 02:05:02 Get your money out of tech stocks, I heard it’s about to take a dive.
2470 2018-11-28 02:03:52 Our stocks are way down for the year.
2471 2018-11-28 02:03:50 for advice I'd say find charts and fundamentals of huge historical winners, then find current stocks that match those parameters. #treasurehunt
2472 2018-11-28 02:03:34 3 stocks all items let's do this
2473 2018-11-28 02:02:58 I suspect some of these Chinese stocks like IQ,BILI, HUYA --can skyrocket if market turns bullish and Trump works his magic on Chinese president
2474 2018-11-28 02:02:53 Stocks bounced back from early losses to close higher Tuesday as gains in so-called defensive sectors helped to offset anxieties that a near-term resolution to trade tensions between the U.S. and China remain elusive.
2475 2018-11-28 02:02:18 Actually, we used the power of the Federal Government to take over a publicly held corp, fire CEO, and shift the value of the stocks all in order to save the Unions from having to renegotiate contracts that wrre strangling the company.
We saved the Unions, not the company

2481 2018-11-28 01:59:59 When I see their stock markets increase as they brag about lowering drug prices. All I see are those who are hurting in their hands with restricted access to medications and pharmacy. When people buy their stocks, I wonder if they know the true cost?
2482 2018-11-28 01:59:47 Like GM laying off 16,000? Like Trump closing the busiest border entry in the world? Guess teargas stocks are up. Oh, no. You mean the fact that Senators and Congressmen come out of Congress WAYYYYYYYY richer than they arrived.
2483 2018-11-28 01:59:11 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
2484 2018-11-28 01:58:13 your stocks are rising number 2
2485 2018-11-28 01:57:53 Trump gave corporations a huge wind fall in the form a tax breaks (courtesy of taxpayers) and in return, corporations bought back stocks and closed plants. Once again, the rich got richer while the rest of us lose.
2486 2018-11-28 01:57:22 Hey SB_DROPS_STOCKS, thanks for the follow! Wishing you the best #success
2487 2018-11-28 01:56:59 This is not a systemic risk because mutual funds have liquidity on-tap from retailers. Even if the collateral stocks are falling, we have a de facto supply of liquidity from retailers, SIPpers and ilk, The retailers are enough experienced in financing our public banks.
2488 2018-11-28 01:55:57 Stocks are available from a small amount, but a lot of expenses are needed to property invest.

2490 2018-11-28 01:54:28 Wait until their 401k's and stocks start dropping like a rock and watch how fast they turn on Trump. I'm speaking only of the educated ofc.
2491 2018-11-28 01:53:14 same, I mean I can save for it but let's be practical for once and knowing the unlimited stocks well we can buy those next time.
2492 2018-11-28 01:52:49 Foenem put them beams on you look like chicken pox and that gun I got that shit don't even come in stocks
2493 2018-11-28 01:51:50 Oh! I have stocks; 401K and just started a Roth 403b  owe nothing but mortgage on house; no other outside debt. If I can’t afford I don’t need it or I save up for it. I have emergency fund as well.  I’m hoping to owe absolutely nothing to anyone in 5 years! 
2494 2018-11-28 01:51:17 Anyone else remember buying beanie babies and thinking they will one day pay for your university.  I truly thought they were like stocks for kids.
2495 2018-11-28 01:49:19 Ask Obama, he forcibly took GM stocks from ordinary people and gave it to the unions, even then GM was unable to make without more government help. Ford could have had the same deal but declined.
2496 2018-11-28 01:48:35 In Focus: Future Retail/Retail Stocks

2499 2018-11-28 01:46:17 Thousands of $'s in stocks became pennies, and GM employees got a bonus, they gave us the Volt which most are in the landfill by now #globalwarming  thousands of cars were destroyed that could have served for years to come with Obama's cash for clunkers.    USA not Venezuela
2500 2018-11-28 01:45:55 well I was working on my car and doing the brakes and they were not working so I went to a mechanic and it took him 2 seconds, why the hell everyone who bought pot stocks that went up thinks they are traders is beyond me

2504 2018-11-28 01:42:12 I remember listening to a podcast where @PeterSchiff warned of all the propped up stocks from buybacks
2505 2018-11-28 01:41:50 World Stock Markets Rise on Politics & Holiday Retail Hopes NY (Reuters) - Wall Street bounced back on  Monday, lifted by expectations that retailers raked in online sales  during a prime holiday shopping period, while EU stocks rallied  after signs that Italy was preparing
2506 2018-11-28 01:41:47 I agree with the technical traders comment!  On some of these low volume stocks, I’ll buy the ask and the new ask will go lower than the previous!  These traders are trying to bring down share price!
2507 2018-11-28 01:40:52 # of stocks in the S&P-500 w/ a valuation greater than $4 billion = 498.

2508 2018-11-28 01:40:43 If @IndianaMBB covers the +8.5 spread against @dukembb, then I get to allocate 50% of @rs_levy portfolio to US retail stocks. Can you say $JCP, $BBBY, , $FOSL, $ANF....??
2509 2018-11-28 01:40:42 So let me put it this way then.....mutual funds did not buy wen the stocks went down and the businesses were available at a bargain........again no evidence of long term investing.

2515 2018-11-28 01:38:01 Interesting Smash Ultimate fact: Marth's final doesn't seem to one hit kill in stamina mode. It just does a decent amount of damage. This was with Smash meter on. Also stamina can be as high as 999% with stocks but I think people knew that? It opens up more options honestly.

2517 2018-11-28 01:36:51 Looks like a GREAT time to buy @Apple stocks. Any corporation or person that oppose Trump prospers greatly. @Nike did.

2525 2018-11-28 01:31:35 As predicted, they used the money to pay themselves or buy back their stocks. Democrats told you so!

2527 2018-11-28 01:30:49 Idk who need to hear this, but- get that life insurance, invest in that 401k, buy those company stocks, and think beyond the scope of yourself.
2528 2018-11-28 01:26:54 Todd, I missed your last ? period tweet and I've been dying to ask you about two stocks that I was long into RTOs. Now, $XTHC / $GGB worked out quite well, but I'm waiting for my $BUDD that will resume as FLRish/Harborside. I have no idea what to expect, any opinion on this?
2529 2018-11-28 01:26:50 For the first time, I bought a short sale in the US stock market and suffered a lot. Goodbye to US stocks!

2531 2018-11-28 01:25:48 There should be a movement for insurance companies to divest themselves of their fossil fuel clients. Similar to 350.orgs divestment movement for selling off stocks.

2533 2018-11-28 01:23:03 United Tech is breaking into 3 parts so @rongross144, Mac and I dig into some of the details @MarketFoolery @themotleyfool. This move should be a good one for $UTX shareholders though I would wait for more deets about Aviation, Carrier and Otis as own stand alone stocks.
2534 2018-11-28 01:22:47 I haven't been able to make fundamental economic sense of weed stocks either.  The only thing I can think of is an expectation of broad legalization in Europe and the US....and the Canadian weed cos would be well positioned to expand internationally.
2535 2018-11-28 01:21:19 They're not too bright if they voted trump believing his job bs 
Gm just announced jobs going away 
AND THEN GM STOCKS ROSE
Trump HELPED the RICH
AGAIN
2536 2018-11-28 01:21:16 Corporate stripping is always the result with tariffs.  They lost $1.5 billion and don't want to bear the cost of retooling. They'll just take their tax windfall, buy back their stocks and open in another country. You should be shouting at Trump.
2537 2018-11-28 01:20:33 2018 returns. Stocks bonds  property taxes 
2538 2018-11-28 01:20:13 Censoring anyone based on their political viewpoint is the same as censoring someone based on religion or sexual orientation.  

It shouldn't be done in America and it should piss everyone off.

People are responding with pulling their money out of those stocks.
2539 2018-11-28 01:20:07 Better buy Ford stocks now.
2540 2018-11-28 01:19:30 Stocks may decrease because older immigrants die and too few come to replace them. Flows can be *positive* while stocks shrink.
2541 2018-11-28 01:17:34 I have made some good money trading great penny stocks. I treated them like long term. I bought tens of thousands of shares for less than $1 that ran to $30. then 4 days later it was delisted. Listening? I also bought one at $1 sold for $18 extensive research. Listening?
2542 2018-11-28 01:16:54 If you were protecting America’s  workers, why did you give a huge tax break to corporations and CEOs, who in turn invested in stocks to enrich themselves instead of investing in workers and building their businesses? #TrumpLies

2544 2018-11-28 01:15:59 And she did remember specific details of the assault. Her testimony was a chilling reminder to many women who were mere girls 33 years ago. You cannot apply today's mores to those of the early 80s. "Rape" in those times referred to a brutal assault. As a man, you can't understand
2545 2018-11-28 01:15:58 You know wah annoying, seeing women on here give the man dem weh a try a ting wid di stocks and bonds and forex grief. Say them hype.

2548 2018-11-28 01:14:17 That's exactly what it was, once in lifetime.  Two things we were happy we did. 1. Didn't buy a new house at time of housing peek.  2.  Sock away as much cash as possible.  After the crash, very few had cash to invest and take a chance. Not all stocks hit, but many did.

Penny trading I’ve called high risk high reward, for good reason. Have I traded Penny Stocks? Yes. It takes SKILL. You can buy a mailbox if you don’t know what your doing. Learn every detail of the company, ck lawsuits & SEC. I want to see and know the company.
2551 2018-11-28 01:12:15 And by the way, just so you know, I don't agree with the fact that GM was given bailout money from the Obama Administration, and still goes out of business, but the president needs to keep this s*** off Twitter and deal with it outside of destroying their stocks and chances
2552 2018-11-28 01:11:54 i dead have two weeks to:

2559 2018-11-28 01:08:50 We know the real reason: It’s to give a back door into crypto speculation for funds that are limited in what vehicles they are allowed to use. A year ago, @fundstrat made the argument that adding 2% BTC to a portfolio with 49% in stocks + 49% in bonds would increase returns and..
2560 2018-11-28 01:08:13 Cheers! I’ll prob do an update every week since RoCo is always going to be among the leaders.

2562 2018-11-28 01:07:06 $NHPI I'm not ever telling anybody what to do, If you don't feel comfortable do what you need to do,  but people on  Twitter are not the only people buying and selling these stocks and this one is worth having. If you put a sell order in today and it went quick then you fucked up
2563 2018-11-28 01:06:16 @realDonaldTrump @RealCandaceO Well he lost the house and made sure Scott got booted in Wis. what else is there?

2570 2018-11-28 01:02:27 Why are we cutting rich peoples taxes when we're currently bombing 8 countries? You know who profits from war? Not me and you. Plus corporations haven't invested that tax cut in employees. They bought their own stocks to inflate their value.
2571 2018-11-28 01:02:22 Joe I was banned 3 days ago.  First I was suspended then apparently totally banned and it said my page did not exist.  I freaked out and being engaged in the tech stocks realized that I had some Twitter in my 401K. I left a message where you inquire about investing.

2593 2018-11-28 00:50:43 I guess GMs recovery from their bailout & record profits now mean they weren't saved from economic despair  what GMs doing now is taking their record profits, cutting jobs to buy back stocks. This makes them more money. Why are Mexico & China benefiting? 2 words tariffs & greed

2607 2018-11-28 00:42:20 Healthy markets need a diversity of opinion. Indexing is the absolute opposite of diversity of opinion.

and each year the very act of rebalancing is by definition performance chasing. Stocks that have gone up get more capital, stocks that have gone down get less capital.

This is a multi penny stock, gotta  have some willpower and knowledge to capitalize on these types. Its a gem! Haven't sold a share!

2611 2018-11-28 00:40:48 YES! Stand with the people over these corporations! We save them with our tax dollars and this is there thank you to AMERICANS? Screw them...their stocks are tanking as we speak! They are being greedy with the very COUNTRY that made them and then saved them! Karma is a bitch!
2612 2018-11-28 00:40:39 200 or 300 bps isn’t going to matter. Laughable that this conversation is being had at record low unemployment. Fed is going to pull out all the stops next time down, meaning they will buy stocks. System is so fragile.  the fed knows it. See autos, oil, housing, semis.
2613 2018-11-28 00:40:37 That was the most perfect bubble in the history of financial assets. Raw irrational exuberance unleashed at maximum strength.

An asset or asset class can undergo an INFINITE number of bubbles. Just look at stocks. 

That argument is quite poor.
2614 2018-11-28 00:40:15 1) ANYONE NOTICE THAT THE FEDERAL RESERVE WANTS TO RAISE INTEREST RATES ?  TRUMP CROSSED ABOUT THAT !  AND SHOULD BE !  IF THEY DO STOCKS WITHOUT EARNINGS

2619 2018-11-28 00:37:17 Actually, I heard GM made 
3 BILLION just in first quarter. Stocks climbed even higher with factoriy news. Rich we're already MUCH richer with massive tax cut.  Not one penny to workers.
 CEO PAY GAP IS SICK. 
WE bailed GM/others out. Now not just jobs lost. Whole towns will die.

2621 2018-11-28 00:35:11 My lefty mother in law cautions us to get out of stocks because 'what comes up must come down.' You can tell from her tone, she doesn't want us hurt but she's itching for the economy to tank so she can say Trump's policies failed. They want to be able to say capitalism failed us.

2623 2018-11-28 00:32:06 You’re right.  I seriously doubt that  a single one of them in the front rows of his rallies even has a clue how to buy or invest in stocks much less the correlations for when things happen and why.  This whole country is being run into the dumpsters for these idiots.

Are we really to believe they are catching the up moves and the down moves within the day

2641 2018-11-28 00:15:32 GM  has done some weird stuff lately.  Put finely designed engines that make both power and fuel mileage in a truck and then jack around with the overall design so that it pushes more air and consumes more fuel.  Execs retire on oil company stocks, too.
2642 2018-11-28 00:13:54 NOW.. they like $tsco since it trounced the market but you can’t buy it here.  Was heavy tech last yr. my bud and I starting rotating into retail in dec 17. $ulta 2nd largest $$. Killed $DKS this yr also while they pumped $tgt.  I watch maybe 100 stocks..stay simple I say.

2649 2018-11-28 00:11:04 @SteveBenjaminSC , i have a question. Did you approve of a ban on bump stocks in Columbia recently? I wondered if other cities,etc. can use this as a precedent to ban them elsewhere. Thank you for all you do for Columbia.
2650 2018-11-28 00:10:22 Yes. Even in 1962 when the mkt was on its ass..Cuban missle crisis..high taxes...fewer households owned stocks than today. It mattered then. Kennedy got congress to rein in tax rates and econ expanded in 63.

2654 2018-11-28 00:06:56 Listen please, many on the Hill have advance notice of stock movements. With no control of who in one's family can invest in stocks. Lobbyists allowed to find payoff shoe box investments. Anyone on the Hill can become a millionaire.
2655 2018-11-28 00:06:16 @elonmusk how is it that you get in trouble for affecting stock prices by the SEC, yet the president directly attacks specific companies (on Twitter as well) causing their stocks to plummet, and receives nothing of the sort?

This is dumb.
2656 2018-11-28 00:05:57 Anyone else noticing that Wall Street doesn't care about profitable small and mid cap stocks? Lots of good companies are down 20-40%.
2657 2018-11-28 00:05:21 Hope they use the same investor Protections that they used with Penny Stocks.........Those worked real well
2658 2018-11-28 00:05:13 I dont think it will be initially, even as the least speculative crypto its still one of the most speculative investments, but every time bitcoin survives a crash it gets stronger. You cant pay your tax in Ohio with stocks
