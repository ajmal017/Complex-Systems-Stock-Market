52 2018-10-22 23:26:31 Did Trump say if he will be delivering those middle class tax cuts before or after he bans bump stocks like he said he would back in May?

Also will Trump's tax cuts be immediately followed by Social Security & Medicare cuts to pay for them?
53 2018-10-22 23:26:07 Actually he addresses that too.  I sent him my review and he sent me a 100
page analysis of his thought process.  It included what allocations to use on different valuations.  For instance retiring now, I wouldn’t have more than a 30% allocation to stocks unless you had other

1) As stocks, bonds, housing crash & recession hits, you'll see a rising crypto market.
2) Crypto market will over-inflate into bubble territory over extended period = massive profit potential for those with exit strategies.

134 2018-10-22 22:31:53 No better way to lose your ass then to trade in penny stocks with no assets and no earnings. People don't buy them but they get sold on them. I would hope you are trading with somebody else's money

137 2018-10-22 22:31:04 Which asset classes are the best investments now? Stocks fair/over valued. Bonds weak. Real estate weak. Oil topped out. Commodities flat. International stocks weak. What's an investor to do?
138 2018-10-22 22:30:11 As much as I love to invest in biotech stocks, but every year there is a cycle of time with sector weakness that let you hold many bags (myself uncluded). 

Our solution is to trade hi-beta options stocks to reduce the losses.

143 2018-10-22 22:24:21 The positive effects of tax cuts work when those reductions go to lower income earners who spend any additional disposable income they have. The corporations, instead, bought back their stocks, helping to send the stock market up. Wealthy folks invest in tax shelters.
144 2018-10-22 22:22:38 Eh if they want to try to short it let them. I don’t see it going lower than what it did during the summer, could be wrong but I think with everything coming along we’ll see a bump. Pot stocks across the board took a beating today too, I’m not too worried about RLV currently
145 2018-10-22 22:22:09 The economy won't tank. Stock prices will fall. Those two facts are different. The wealthiest 10% of Americans own 86% of all stocks. Don't confuse their portfolios temporarily falling as economic collapse. Sears and Toys'R'Us going bankrupt, Ford, Carrier, Harley layoffs are.
146 2018-10-22 22:21:54 How much do you put in these penny stocks?
147 2018-10-22 22:21:16 Hey @cuttysarkblend - how can I find a restaurant that stocks you, in the north-of-Boston / Nashua NH area?  An out-of-town friend needs a Cutty Sark toast with dinner next Saturday, and every place I've called says they don't have you!
148 2018-10-22 22:20:47 I’m not in favor of bump stocks personally. I think they’re a stupid novelty overall. 

The point I’m making though, is the vast majority of gun violence comes from handguns. The focus on rifles seems a little counterproductive to me
149 2018-10-22 22:20:46 Trump: "Hey #Mnuchin, will this lie stop the slide in US stocks?!"
150 2018-10-22 22:20:40 where else were you going to put your money? in cd's at .55%?? it all went into the market it all went into bond funds bonds preferred stock dividend stocks and that's what you've proved people that did not want risk where forced into riskier assets
151 2018-10-22 22:20:20 Random though: I remember sophomore year of college I was chilling in orgo lab doing my reactions; when this boy told me how his dad put $5,000 into Apple stocks for him when he was young. He prob sitting on some crazy money right now.
152 2018-10-22 22:20:15 Now that Fast Money has run its crypto “pump” into the ground, now hyping the “new” crypto...pot stocks!

156 2018-10-22 22:18:22 I have different stocks that I don’t keep track of. It would be nice to have it consolidated under a platform.

158 2018-10-22 22:17:36 Chlorine is a pure element and widely used for peaceful purposes. It is not included in the Chemical Weapons Convention and Asad wasn’t required to hand over his stocks to the OPCW. It can be weaponised in gaseous form — dropped from aircraft in pressurised cylinders (not bombs).

160 2018-10-22 22:16:28 @jimcramer given the widening of interest margins at regional banks, why are most regional bank stocks taking such a hit?
161 2018-10-22 22:15:26 @thomaskaine5 I set up an account to focus on stocks
162 2018-10-22 22:14:57 You obviously have an opinion on cause and effect. I like to think if stocks go to shit crypto runs. Especially w all fidelity, Bakkt, TD, etc making moves.
163 2018-10-22 22:14:49 Salut @VodKirl Je voudrai savoir si lors de la PGW les stocks des vêtements en vente seront limité ? Si j’y vais lundi est ce que tu penses que il restera des stocks ? Même si je pense pas mais on sait jamais si il y a plus de stock :) merci
164 2018-10-22 22:14:34 Why did Trump say he's looking into banning bump stocks if it isn't a good point?
165 2018-10-22 22:14:06 Which stocks abeg? Nigerian stock exchange? cc: @asemota
166 2018-10-22 22:14:01 Clearly you haven’t read the text, as by this logic, any memeber of government who has any stocks or business can’t do federal contracts, or be part of any organization that deals in government work.
167 2018-10-22 22:13:34 Stocks, Treasury Bills, Bonds etc
168 2018-10-22 22:12:25 you're treating this stuff like it's the next $amzn ----  just absurd ---- these stocks are toast

170 2018-10-22 22:10:57 It would have been better if bonds had caught a strong bid during this correction. This tape is not normal and stocks are not happy about it.
171 2018-10-22 22:08:35 Historically, after you have tweeted me, stocks are up in the next 6, 9 and 12 months, by an average of 473.9901%.
172 2018-10-22 22:08:26 Stocks Slip Again, and Automakers Continue a Long Decline
173 2018-10-22 22:07:41 So far, doesn't look like markets have priced in a Trump INF missile build-up or anything; usual suspect defense stocks have mostly been flat & correlated to broader market.
174 2018-10-22 22:07:32 And bump stocks are still legal...America...a society armed more than Afghanistan itself to include the all USMil, Taliban, and foreign fighters...facts
175 2018-10-22 22:06:57 Over 50 people murdered in Las Vegas, Trump can't even ban bump stocks.

Smh.
176 2018-10-22 22:05:57 What makes you so confident that the btc will be a hedge against stocks. Because every time stocks get a hit; btc goes up for i couple of hours and then slams down just like them..?
177 2018-10-22 22:05:32 Just started my investment career purchases 3 stocks let’s see where this is going 
178 2018-10-22 22:05:14 Anyway you can DM me so I can add more?  The short—I spend the first 2 hours of the day reading everything I can about crypto and stocks.  I spend my working time traveling through many different hospitals in Chicago and constantly think of ways to improve my patient’s care...
179 2018-10-22 22:04:10 I know anyone invested in weed stocks is cheesed today 
180 2018-10-22 22:04:07 I realized I was growing up this morning when I woke up and checked my stocks just for fun

182 2018-10-22 22:02:56 We need five astronauts.

Do you ever go to McDonalds or Walmart? Somebody drives the truck to the store. Somebody makes french fries. Somebody stocks the shelves.

They represent around 40% of the workforce. Those jobs exist because we as a society buy those things.

185 2018-10-22 21:59:35 #Infibeam cracked from 214 to 39 in one month, more than 80% price erosion. One needs to identify these kinda stocks and stay away from them, never should be tempted to buy because price came down drastically, market knows the script better than us and gives it the best rate.
186 2018-10-22 21:59:09 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
187 2018-10-22 21:58:30 No one seems to care as long as their 401k or stocks do well. Short sighted and selfish.
188 2018-10-22 21:58:04 For the GOP, "Pride Goeth Before a Fall".  The economy cannot grow if wages are stagnant. Spending will cease, and the surpluses of goods will send prices and stocks plummeting. No one wins when the corporations let their greed overtake their sense of humanity and reality.
189 2018-10-22 21:58:04 that guys is so great for market panic photo ops..but he doesn't even own stocks himself. lol
190 2018-10-22 21:57:43 @thinkorswim 
Is there info somewhere that explains why stocks are HTB or ETB there? I'm genuinely curious why big floats are HTB there. I do not understand the mechanics and would like to know.

I ask b/c I love TOS but struggling to remain here.
191 2018-10-22 21:57:39 Things not priced into #cannabis stocks: 

1. Efficacy
2. Banking
3. Scale

And 4. w no Wall Street / institutional coverage the selling is retail-driven / indiscriminate; or an opportunity to lay-in-wait for a more efficient market.
192 2018-10-22 21:57:36 it's childish gambino buying stocks from the NASDAQ
fuck white boys like these cocks up my asscrack
193 2018-10-22 21:57:04 I don't know that it helps us, but when a stock is up 300%, the company feels they have to do something, so they put out the news that there is no news, and it drops.  Just be careful with chasing stocks up that much!
194 2018-10-22 21:56:51 That fucker also says no to chinese stocks now we will see baba jd huya etc flying :)
195 2018-10-22 21:55:26 i hope ur right, though i would put it past US stocks to magically ""be great again" ;-)

199 2018-10-22 21:48:36 Bump stocks. You just learned this word last year huh?
200 2018-10-22 21:47:46 DOW lost 126 as sellers remain in control, it feels like October,,,,,,,,,,,oh wait, it is October,
Have often tweeted over the yrs don't invest in Banks unless you really know the sector and the stocks. Well,,,,,,,,,
201 2018-10-22 21:46:35 I do, I just don’t read/listen to MSM . I look at the facts:
* Peace with NK = our safety!
* Bodies of dead soldiers returned to their FAMILIES!
* Thousands arrested for child sex trafficking!
* Lowest unemployment!
* Highest GDP in years!
* Highest Stocks!

211 2018-10-22 21:42:31 I wonder how many financial advisers--who think they are good at picking stocks--think watching Fast Money or Mad Money is confirmation of their holdings? That's not bottom up research.

217 2018-10-22 21:39:56 Now that @b_guzzz is back from his 2 year twitter hiatus, my skin is clear, my crops are watered and my stocks are up.
218 2018-10-22 21:39:33 Its a down day, but cannabis still had tremendous growth in store. Anyone who can look at a stock like $tsla and see value should see TREMENDOUS value in pot stocks. It’s not even LEGAL yet in the US. And Canada’s market is about the size of CA. We have 49 more states to go

221 2018-10-22 21:36:42 What I realized being on twtr in biotech is nobody knows a god damn  thing. All these posts about good data and undervalued stocks, and analysts PT means absolutely zero in real life.

225 2018-10-22 21:32:39 I think, he's talking about the pot stocks which are burning in flames. Going down, down down.
226 2018-10-22 21:32:03 If you don’t mine me asking, do you adjust your ichimoku settings for stocks?  Mine are adjusted to 18, 52, 104, 26.
227 2018-10-22 21:30:51 Do you still have this in stocks?
228 2018-10-22 21:30:48 But let’s remember, the cannabis industry is FAR from done growing. Yes, Canadian pot stocks were bloated and needed to come down a bit, but nowhere near as bloated as tech stocks. DOW lost 1400pts in TWO days last week. Cannabis stocks are the safest bet on the market right now.
229 2018-10-22 21:28:38 But you didn't really buy stocks lol. You bought tokens, not stocks.
230 2018-10-22 21:27:20 My stocks goin up I’m happy
231 2018-10-22 21:27:05 Lmao 100% accurate. But I love bear markets because I never trade stocks.
232 2018-10-22 21:26:43 My only bright spot is 90% of my cannabis stocks are the ones listed plus $GWPH. Sold the ones I thought were the weak ones (too late). Wanted to dump them all today but walked away.

235 2018-10-22 21:22:37 What is "the economy" doing for the blue-collar @realdonaldtrump voters who cheer at his rallies?  They don't own stocks or large businesses. they're not wealthy, they need jobs, food stamps,   health care, social security, etc and the GOP is going to take that all away.

237 2018-10-22 21:21:37 Beware! Per @gilliantett on @MeetThePress with @KatyTurNBC if stocks continue to tumble the WH is prepared to blame on #BlueWave fearing the Dems will roll back deregulation. #GOTV. #VoteForYourLife. It depends on it. #DangerousTimes

239 2018-10-22 21:21:13 Stocks tank because pricing & quality. The general public isn’t happy and are sticking to their original sources. Not to mention Canada can’t even keep up their supply let alone provide high THC levels.

258 2018-10-22 21:10:06 Read charts. Read News. Read Financials. Read Financial Reports. Read Quarterlies. Read Disclosure Filings.

That's what gets you ahead with stocks.

Warren Buffett spends all his time reading.

There's probably a good reason.

260 2018-10-22 21:09:31 Didn't housing peak in 2005 and F hit a low in mid 2006? Some stocks will do well if the 10 & 30 yields just start going in reverse, even if it means inversion.
261 2018-10-22 21:08:50 You found any Low float Palladium stocks?
262 2018-10-22 21:08:45 Watching weed stocks tumble today. If the “sell the news” tactic is so effective, why don’t more people setup short positions in these types of announcements?
263 2018-10-22 21:07:43 $SPY In these type market conditions; the last thing I'm thinking about is to risk chasing stocks higher.
264 2018-10-22 21:07:29 Haven't watched ZNBC in a long time, but last time I watched the news the closing prices of stocks would scroll past. Check with one of these Brokers. Stock Brokers Zambia, Pangea EMI and I'm not sure if Intermarket Securities are operating.

267 2018-10-22 21:05:00 To clarify, weed stocks won't always be upwards to the right. At some point you will need to pick real operators. Not just brokers/bankers pretending to be operators. This is where the smart money begins looking moving forward. Much harder to diligence than a "story stock."
268 2018-10-22 21:04:26 The top five stocks that closed lower today were $NkTR, $SCG, $BMY, $SYF, and $WRK.

282 2018-10-22 20:57:38 Yen at Risk as Stocks Rise, Aussie Dollar Down on Local Politics
283 2018-10-22 20:56:35 Interesting, this is what crypto investors said in January, and cobalt investors said in March. It’s almost like there is a hot sector every 6 months or so in the market and then it fizzles out... but Pot stocks must be different....
284 2018-10-22 20:56:04 Night-scented stocks not much to look at, but in the summer evening I go outside and smell the  plants releasing a wonderful scent that make me feel special
285 2018-10-22 20:55:09 OOOO TY I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR TIGHTS THAT ARE SQUAT PROOF AND STAY UP (and in stick lmao) (((I've been waiting for clique tights to come back in stocks, and when they did they sold out in 15 mind rip)))

287 2018-10-22 20:51:57 Not only were the pot stocks down today so were shares of

288 2018-10-22 20:50:19 Every day can use some jocularity !
289 2018-10-22 20:49:46 How can that be...I thought pot stocks were the new bitcoin
290 2018-10-22 20:48:35 "Just
five technology stocks account for
about 13% of the market value of
the Standard & Poor’s 500 index, a
concentration not seen since the height
of the tech/telecom bubble that burst
in 2000."

Interesting metrics coming out of @EvercoreWealth research.

292 2018-10-22 20:46:00 It was so much fun getting my first "real" headshots done at the ENCCOG Ministers' Meeting a few weeks ago. Headshots with Allen Stocks is so much fun and so easy to work with. Thanks for helping me "adult!" #Adulting

294 2018-10-22 20:45:00 The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average traded slightly lower on Monday, as early gains tracking a rally in China market faded with oil and financial stocks pushing the indexes lower.
295 2018-10-22 20:44:58 Taking on additional debt to buy back stocks is stupid and not in the best interest of long term shareholders.  Unfortunately, too many companies are doing that now.
296 2018-10-22 20:43:32 Myself and @LorcanRK spent a lot of time looking at bargain basement property in Ireland. He bought Italian Bank stocks and got rich, I paid down UK mortgage, in line with inherited terror of debt.
297 2018-10-22 20:42:42 My opinion is that stocks that run close to 100% into news tend to sell off. This company could also use some institutional shareholders as well. The results of the meeting were positive and I expect it to recoup these losses in fairly short order.
298 2018-10-22 20:42:37 Majority of traders do errors to jump in early. This market tends to dump after only a certain time. In morning u see crowd and when all get stopped and exausted, then u have to step in, looking for real time when u see that change / supply demand that leads to the dump

306 2018-10-22 20:38:01 If your entire portfolio is weed stocks and you are freaked out or surprised by a day like today, well, you probably shouldn't be holding a portfolio of weed stocks. This is how its been for over 3 years. Volatile and upward to the right.

Do you think cryptocurrencies as whole could be a new asset class that could be integrated into the dual momentum strategy?

350 2018-10-22 20:18:35 Using $SPX , 46% of all trading days since 1950's have produced losses. 40% of monthly, 27% of yearly and 20% of five-year periods have also been negative.
Easiest way to improve the odds you're happy with how stocks are performing? Look less frequently.
351 2018-10-22 20:18:29 Thanks for the ideas. Zacks already has over 200 #1 (Strong Buy) stocks every day that I can choose from (as well as top Value stocks, if I want to search for those using the Zacks Value Scores.) I have plenty of stock picks, including in my own portfolios.
352 2018-10-22 20:18:07 I know of a hedge fund that simply sells short stocks with multiple insider selling and buys stocks with multiple insider buying-CEO buying. It’s returned 16%annualized since 2002 outperforming the S&P by 10% annualized and It’s leveraged vehicle has returned 30% a year

356 2018-10-22 20:16:55 @AmrithRamkumar  Hey, where can I find the information "A steady stream of robust earnings and economic data has virtually zapped volatility from U.S. stocks, but a coming freeze on share buybacks could challenge the market."?
357 2018-10-22 20:16:51 Bought my first stocks today.. Thank you @Robinhoodapp
358 2018-10-22 20:16:46 World stocks ex China generally lower: US & Europe -.4%. Investors looking at S&P 500 earnings-growth ex tax benefits are seeing only 6% year-over-year. Suggests 2019 earnings-growth will be in single-digits. Couple this with slower sales-growth & 2019 market-gains likely modest.
359 2018-10-22 20:16:13 I knew this was going to happen. The time to have made money in the industry was a couple of years ago. The weed mania stocks in the last 12 months were classic tulip mania. Lots of ordinary folks are going to lose money.

372 2018-10-22 20:08:51 Of course, Tesla stock, like most stocks, has its ups and downs, as does Musk, and all humans. I’m nonetheless skeptical about the recent negative narrative. When I inquire into it I find no real substance and plenty of misleading stuff.

376 2018-10-22 20:07:54 Some subtle signs of strength today in many growth stocks but volume was super light. I'll be curious to see what happens later this week when volume kicks in. Personally, I think many are still complacent and we need more downside...but I hope I'm wrong.

380 2018-10-22 20:04:05 Ho-hum day for the market, Dow drops over 100, S&P 12 points....nice rally in semiconductor stocks lifting the Nasdaq. Homebuilders got hammered....not a lot of enthusiasm for the housing market right now with tight supplies and rising prices and mortgage rates.
381 2018-10-22 20:03:24 I am always open minded to other markets. But my focus is and will be on #stocks. You cannot be a specialist in all #markers.
382 2018-10-22 20:03:15 That’s cool but just wondered about your reasoning given recent events. Personally I think stocks will rally into the end of the year having just had a bad patch. But it’s clear that there’s no clear inverse relationship between stocks and crypto.
383 2018-10-22 20:02:58 Nor do I. But history shows that the largest single-day gains almost always occur in the midst of bear markets. I'm still very negative on China stocks, even relative to US.
384 2018-10-22 20:02:49 probably a combo of housing stocks getting shredded + china tariffs

But IDK I like the stuff, I like the gallery approach. Just not smart enough to know when it's a buy. I've traded it more wrong than right.
385 2018-10-22 20:02:09 Invest in stocks tbh. Not with all of it but that and putting a lot of it in an account where it can accrue interest would be my first order of business (after paying off my loans )
386 2018-10-22 20:01:58 Sorta. Stocks and bonds are borderline liquid. That's where most of it lives. Real estate is another matter but people like Jeff Bezos don't hold tons of that as investments.
387 2018-10-22 20:01:25 Do you see most stocks? Do you see banks? Do you see housing? Do you see anything besides 5 tech stocks? Thanks @federalreserve 3 times in 18 years!!!!

406 2018-10-22 19:49:02 Actually the big banks stocks rose massively after the crash & Obamas bailout, because they officially became the safest bet in town.

Since the big banks proved once & for all, that they where totally above the law & where going to continue to be bailed out by the US government.

538 2018-10-22 18:45:54 If it wasn't for the CFP, Westminster & Tory lobbying would have seen North Sea fish stocks obliterated decades ago for short term profit margins. Any fisherman supporting this stupidity is signing a death warrant for the industry.
539 2018-10-22 18:44:28 they've bought in 2009 & have sold all year now. They were mocked for doing so by those who bought after 2016 & ridiculed for missing the YTD ramp that is now flat/negative for indexes/stocks. Smart $ bought has massive profits. Recent inv are tending to self inflicted wounds.
540 2018-10-22 18:44:05 U know sir,what's my biggest take away from my guru's, 
U all focused on one particular area n after so many u keep continued.

Most new traders like me jump here n their.

The day u mentioned in one tweet focus on few stocks only. 
result is incredible. 

Focus definitely work.
541 2018-10-22 18:44:05 Severe gun control? Like banning assault weapons and bump stocks? YES!
542 2018-10-22 18:43:57 what does that have to do with the @nra banning bump stocks?   stay focused
543 2018-10-22 18:43:38 where it is trading at today, I think stocks can get "over sold" would you agree?
544 2018-10-22 18:42:43 Anyone using market data before 2000 to estimate #tradingstrategy alpha is being fooled by randomness and conditions that will probably never occur again. Especially all those momentum and TF backtests reflect wishful thinking. Markets have changed. #stocks #trading #investments
545 2018-10-22 18:42:31 Hi Kim here 

Reflecting the beanie campaign is 70 beanies in an Indian summer as we building stocks to give out from Sunday is amazing although it’s not enough we have competition however most of the schemes doing this don’t list who they are giving to eg the charities we do 1/2
546 2018-10-22 18:40:49 How are those PowerPrayers working out for unfortunate citizens:
• Of PR?
• With Trump backed preexisting conditions?
• Living w/Trump backed racism?
• Dying of Trump backed Mesothelioma
• Dead from Trump backed bump-stocks
• (too many to mention bere)

548 2018-10-22 18:40:05 Well my bank shorts are up 50% today. Not selling either. How in God’s name are stocks still at this level today? AAPL. That’s it folks. If people think that financials don’t matter to AAPL guess again. They’ll be discounting the iPhone again you watch.

553 2018-10-22 18:37:59 How different can be a t-shirt. T-shirt and a lingi...almost looks similar in any brand. The stocks are over in an hour every time.

578 2018-10-22 18:26:42 the stock market is making it easy to find stocks that are falling precipitously that are fun to watch, but not worthy of (my) capital
579 2018-10-22 18:26:30 i am so thankful that I can approach the stock market day to day with an intermediate-term and long-term view on stocks so the short term gyrations are accepted in context of the bigger move

595 2018-10-22 18:16:44 #Trading #Tip:

When trading #OTC stocks, most of the time you are trading the movement or volatility of the stock, not the fundamentals of the company.

Trade the ticker, not the company > Trade the trade...
596 2018-10-22 18:16:39 @GuyAdami stocks down, VIX flat. You said stocks down, VIX down is safe. Are we getting close?

607 2018-10-22 18:10:36 Why are bulls dropping so much in AAII and II, despite a mild drop in SP stocks? Most missed the Fusion Super Bull and tried catch up with momentum stocks that got hit more in this Type 2 correction. Type 1 was in January. Both needed, bullish , normal in LT secular bull markets

621 2018-10-22 18:02:12 $MRTX - people wondering why, despite obviously deceptive PR, this isn't crashing - very typical for stocks with large institutional holding to "stay put" on ambiguously bad data to not cause panic and for big funds not to fold on themselves. Should just be a slow bleed

626 2018-10-22 18:01:04 Isn’t that kind of normal though? Big buy out, the original people hang around for 2-3 years until all there stocks or whatever pay off then they spit to start a new thing.

632 2018-10-22 17:56:15 Whatever happened to the various weed stocks the past 24 hours?

When it does, the currency will fall 15% or 20%."

664 2018-10-22 17:41:30 What a joke, no accountability. The same MSM puppets who said "if rates rise for the right reasons" (like a strong economy) stocks would rise with them are now just "confused," saying "we have a Goldilocks economy but rising rates may be hurting stock prices..." Wow...

672 2018-10-22 17:40:03 Agree with this thread except on this direct investing should be allowed for classified investors.

That way direct investing in stocks should be banned for individual investors who lose their capital every other day.

804 2018-10-22 16:47:52 I was so lucky to not fall for this in my journey thus far! Fallen for high valuation traps but not in any of these things. Never bought silly stocks. Thanks to my family members.
805 2018-10-22 16:47:47 I know the #DowJones is only down about 150 but I am seeing losses in a lot of stocks that looks more like its down 700+. The #TrumpEconomy is one big ponzi scheme.  @ToDropADime2

814 2018-10-22 16:45:06 “Since the last cycle was worst for tech stocks, underweight AAPL and GOOG is the best way to hedge rising rates.” -2018 market logic applied to 2005/06

816 2018-10-22 16:44:53 Larry, Trump deserves all credit. Obama none. Worked on Wall Street. Learned Markets are driven by perception, & can erupt unpredictably because our analysis is defeated by networked, complex systems. The former, traders overvalue stocks; the latter, none see mortgage bubble.

825 2018-10-22 16:41:47 and to answer the "how low can stocks go" question, it's easy. The answer is that they can go much much lower than you think. The only ones surprised about market moves are the ones that aren't prepared

832 2018-10-22 16:39:58 Stocks mixed so far today. TREND STILL DOWN, FULL HEDGES IN PLACE. More trying to find a floor to stand on it appears. Stay on alert and enjoy the ride!
833 2018-10-22 16:39:33 You could say that this is a trout for StarKist’s brand. They shouldn’t hogfish all their revenue like that. I’m expecting their stocks to flounder for a while.
834 2018-10-22 16:39:24 Your odds of picking the best stock in the S&P 500 every year are 1 in 505 (there's actually 505 stocks in the #sp500 ). In other words, those odds are over 600,000 times better than hitting the #MegaMillionsJackpot :)

840 2018-10-22 16:35:44 No shift seen yet. Ethanol prices are going up since demand will eat stocks from now into the inter-harvests period. And despite recent rise in sugar prices, Brazil's currency went from 4.20 to the dollar to 3.67 due to elections, so the rise didn't mean higher returns in reais
841 2018-10-22 16:35:19 $IGC Long $2.65 avg... Nice support on daily here even with pot stocks trending down, very possible for reversal
842 2018-10-22 16:35:02 Many stocks got huge gain in the past 2~3 years, now below 200 DMA. Downside risk is there. No margin.
843 2018-10-22 16:34:23 My beginner strategy it to buy as many stocks as I can for the budget I'm willing to spend. 
Have alot to show for my money.
Then sit back and see what works
Yes I read and only buy stock I'm familiar with. I wont go broke taking profits
844 2018-10-22 16:34:16 Ahem, it wasn't the sell, @GOP...we didn't BUY that sh•t! Stop insulting our intelligence; we can read! We read how corporations used their tax savings to buy back stocks, enriching THEMSELVES instead of raising wages as (allegedly) intended! FOH!

847 2018-10-22 16:32:54 Did he ask how much his buddies made playing the market with prison stocks? The insider trading by this admin starting on Election Day 16 prison stock rally hasn't been a story since the Boeing debacle early 17 because of too many other crimes in plain sight.
848 2018-10-22 16:32:37 My response, as the son of a stockbroker and as a former financial advisor, is that your parking spot is fixed, while the value of a stock can go up and down for many reasons.  Trust your OWN research in picking stocks!  Or pick some low-fee ETFs.

852 2018-10-22 16:31:46 I see stocks like this go from 25 to 15 regularly be careful this ones already half way there....
853 2018-10-22 16:30:51 Yes, I track a few Dow stocks.  I prefer $CAT and those on a daily setup.  
854 2018-10-22 16:30:30 Hopefully!
855 2018-10-22 16:30:13 True stocks like Bajaj, Hero are available at lower PE levels..

857 2018-10-22 16:29:57 Tom, you discount their subsidiaries, PR lobbying, security firms, and related think tank and news media cheerleaders. 

In total it’s massive wealthly and powerful, wealth directly tied to stocks, elite schools, real estate in the nicest neighborhoods in stable cities/burbs.
858 2018-10-22 16:29:51 Downtrend continues in Cannabis stocks.. I suspect a very big deal is about to be announced at these low prices, and then a face-ripping move north. And then again, maybe I’m just enjoying my buzz and dreaming. Either way, the boat is loaded. $trul, $weed, $acb, $ian

864 2018-10-22 16:28:11 Some people are blaming @AndrewScheer’s comments over the weekend for this drop. IMO this is more a result of the big run up we had since mid Aug. When stocks run up hard they often go the other way. Unfortunately the ones that did run are taking the ones that didn’t down too
865 2018-10-22 16:27:57 @RedlerAllAccess  Hedge funds deleveraging today.  No real news in pot stocks yet getting blasted lower. is a sign

867 2018-10-22 16:27:30 1. When China props it’s stocks you have to ask why?

870 2018-10-22 16:24:34 Global luxury brand stocks have seen 11% decline in October 2018. Around $150 billion of market value has been wiped off.

951 2018-10-22 15:55:27 40% of my Portfolio is invested in stocks which rarely trade everyday.. That is due to insufficient liquidity.. They are in the category of $5Mn - $20Mn Market Cap.. Someday some Mutual Fund / HNIs are surely going to get into them :)

953 2018-10-22 15:55:09 Also, it's interesting to look at the NYSE Composite and how poorly it's done over the past year. It shows how much of the DJIA, S&P 500, and NASDAQ performance is driven by the big NASDAQ stocks.

1033 2018-10-22 15:17:34 I completely agree. For me I'm just sitting tight. Watching how stocks are acting on shorter time frames and taking the occasional day trade. No need to die from 1000 paper cuts.
1034 2018-10-22 15:17:31 Although I totally agree that bump stocks are the least of our concerns!
1035 2018-10-22 15:17:24 Trading only one side of the probability distribution is like playing a sport with only one side of your body. Why is long or flat the only right positions. Mark probably doesn't speak to it because over the last 30 years stocks have gone up and are geared to do so by the system.

1040 2018-10-22 15:15:33 Lots of flip-flopping on the Street today....oil stocks dropping on Haliburton's mixed earnings news, but chip stocks are bouncing back thanks to a big rebound from AMD.  We've seen several reversals already by the Dow and S&P. Volatility though is down a bit.

1053 2018-10-22 15:10:06 Stocks go up, they go down, and even go sideways. If you're in a down trend, bail. If you're in an up trend accumulate. If it's sideways, watch patiently.

1160 2018-10-22 14:39:09 @Varneyco  Why the hell do you have Stockman on your showso frequently. He obviously has an interest in making the market go down. He is either short the market or wants to cause market to go south so he can pick up stocks on the cheap. I click FBN OFF when he comes on.
1161 2018-10-22 14:38:44 Many exposed to investing for first time through penny stocks got wrecked and never returned. Learning charts and playing pump and dumps is fine but you gotta learn how to analyze companies too which is a totally different skill.
1162 2018-10-22 14:38:37 #US stocks started the day higher, but have quickly reversed course as #Netflix, #Hasbro, and bank #stocks lead the decline.  With fears of rising rates continuing to put pressure on equities, today's US T-bill auction will be particularly interesting to me.

1171 2018-10-22 14:36:57 If your watchlist is getting shorter, it’s a sign of bad times. If it is getting filled with good set-ups, time to enter the market again. 

No need to watch what indices are doing. Stocks with good set-ups always breakout/breakdown much before market bottoms/tops out.

1394 2018-10-22 13:17:07 I haven't seen anything but obviously most of the big FTSE100 is quite global. I suspect moving to such Stocks might not help though - moving to Cash might work better. If a Deal done  (and that is most likely outcome) then I suspect tiny hit if any to UK Economy.
1395 2018-10-22 13:16:48 I want to thank to all of PANIC MONGERS who brought some of quality stocks LOWER and given us OPPORTUNITY to buy at discount.

1772 2018-10-22 09:11:48 True! But quota can also be used to help end over fishing. If a fleet lacks quota it can become a mono-species fishery w/ heavily fished stocks. Allowing the fleet 2 diversify spreads the fishing effort- making it both environmentally & economically sustainable!

SA markets closed in the red on Friday, pulled down by losses in mining sector stocks and following the release of disappointing Chinese economic data. 117 stocks closed higher, 112 closed lower and 199 were unchanged.
What to watch this week
1945 2018-10-22 06:37:27 How can this be an issue?!
I'll just believe that stocks are finite, but the system automatically synthesises replacements, the raw materials collected from interstellar matter during supercruise and hyperdrive jumps.
Simplistic but that'll satisfy me ...

2084 2018-10-22 04:36:36 Interesting day for #stocks here in Australia...

Earlier today $SPX futures were down at ~2,750. They are now at ~2,770. 

Sure the #ASX and #SPI are off their lows. But idown 0.6% and 0.7% they're struggling. 

A poor performance given US and #China (HUGE)  turnaround

2087 2018-10-22 04:31:02 Perhaps you're right @StarDestr0yer. For all #Lithium lovers I really hope this is correct! I have no vested interes. The $LIT #ETF is the biggest precursor for me. Every commodity trader knows to look at the ETF when trying to #long commodity stocks so why don't INVESTORS?

2107 2018-10-22 04:10:05 Put your phone down and read a variety of stunning intellectuals about the dangers of ax blades on bump-stocks, and any number of topics--and I never heard about Vice until they started writing about me and my friend said, “Are you listening to some alt-right talk show?”
2108 2018-10-22 04:08:16 Surely we need to people like you. You somehow find positive view of the market or particular stocks when there is pessimism everywhere
2109 2018-10-22 04:07:47 Has DJT walked his followers' savings into an historically-high stock market with get-on-board bravado? In event of another stocks correction, does he shove the Fed out the door to face the angry mob? Effect on precious metals?
2110 2018-10-22 04:06:36 Sum it up, I am from 5k to 240k now. To keep my style with available liquid I need to play FAANG or SPX or hype stocks or else I get no fills and marker makers use me as a prop. Something I will figure out, just being transparent w/ where I am at. Goal is to get this to 1mil
2111 2018-10-22 04:06:10 @AndrewGillum I am not one of your constituents, but I have family down there, so I feel I should mention I support most of your goals. Though, if I may, I would put bump stocks in the same realm as silencers, given the chance. Let them be regulated by the ATF

2114 2018-10-22 04:03:50 Sell Ultratech Cemco for 3350 - 3400.. see major selling in cement and steel stocks
2115 2018-10-22 04:03:37 I also invest in stocks which have very low liquidity. Such stocks have not fallen even 10% from my buying price i.e. when nifty was @ 11500+

I don't think this is a bear market. But, many stocks are available @ bear market valuation. Hence, not looking @ Nifty.
2116 2018-10-22 04:03:21 You can own a Bitcoin but if the physical presence of money is what gets you off then why put money in the bank or even own stocks. These are merely digital ledgers anyway. Give a reason why PayPal, Venmo, Alipay, or WeChat Pay already work for many people.

@econet_support You need to step up your stocks game. What's the point of offering something and not being able to deliver. I bet if anyone went to Multichoice with their money today they are getting their DStv. #Kwese
2122 2018-10-22 03:58:23 Absolutely. But here are some flaws with Nifty.
1. Nifty is not balanced sectors. Currently 38% parts of BFSI
2. Nifty goes down it takes overall market sentimental down as it has 63% free float.

From our perspective get much opportunities in individual stocks in bear market.

2201 2018-10-22 02:40:29 After they screwed up with Supermicro story, i avoid watching bloomberg "news". Their main purpose is to "adjust" and feed facts such way, that they can manipulate stocks, and as incentives for professionals who "participate" - bring profit for those companies who does report.

2208 2018-10-22 02:36:34 Japan’s dying shareholders signal sombre outlook for its stocks...
2209 2018-10-22 02:35:34 Agreed. This is going to be a tough week. The $SPY is hanging on a thread, Asian (China, primarily) stocks are on free-fall, Saudi Arabia wants to raise oil in retaliation and the Fed might raise interest rate any day now. Bad week to quite heroin  (just kidding)
2210 2018-10-22 02:35:26 Stocks fell in Japan, Australia and South Korea, while Hong Kong futures tipped a muted open.
2211 2018-10-22 02:35:17 Asian stocks declined at the open Monday alongside U.S. futures as investors focused on whether a recovery in China on Friday can be sustained amid calls for calm from the country’s top finance officials.
2212 2018-10-22 02:33:00 Chinese stocks jump the most since 2016 after top officials express support for the struggling private sector - BBG.
2213 2018-10-22 02:31:50 DeSantis fought hard against a ban on Bump Stocks and all Scott did after Parkland was offer thoughts and prayers. Between these two: children will be schooled in a fortress with armed guards and metal detectors. All to keep the NRA happy. One step closer to a Soviet State!
2214 2018-10-22 02:31:45 I'm not even kidding when I say I've been thinking about taking a loan on my 401k. If stocks fall 20%+ from this level within the life of the loan (considering a 5yr loan), it should be worth it. I need to look into it more. I'm worried for the market if Dems win and they could.

2234 2018-10-22 02:20:03 If QT really is the narrative, that should be less liquidity putting pressure on stocks. They need to run the printing press to not get stocks to bleed off a few percent. Between now and the midterms, stocks are going to be choppy downward is my guess.
2235 2018-10-22 02:20:03 Welcome mate! Wow you got last one! I saw there was two BOTW Link F4F stocks last Friday. Great price for quality F4F figure! I would buy if I got space for it.
2236 2018-10-22 02:20:02 Think of it ths way: Buy'g OTM -> earn less for each dollr of movmnt (Delta)!  We like to go ITM 3 to 5 steps (straddle or strangle), also buy'g extra PUTS, even when confident it'll go up.  Why? Bcz EVERY stock that rises has profit-takers; ALL stocks drop.

2252 2018-10-22 02:08:21 I don’t think there is a better market to trade than the crypto market atm. wouldn’t miss the opportunity to invest/trade a new asset class after it has gone through such a large correction in favour of traditional stocks that are more than likely currently over valued.
2253 2018-10-22 02:07:37 I have a long period of horizon and new stocks are like new customers. Conviction builds over a period of time and validation from existing suppliers is a plus. Its whom to u trust you extend credit like of situation.

2256 2018-10-22 02:06:10 I am just saying that most of the analysis right now from CTs is not accurate at all as they are being in a bear spiral and are missing what has already started! Same thing I did not miss few years ago for stocks!
2257 2018-10-22 02:03:38 I don’t. I’ve had to learn about stocks and things because we’re all responsible for our own retirements nowadays (not that learning is a bad thing here). Going to be a huge crisis in like 20 years or so
2258 2018-10-22 02:03:07 Gartman: "I don't like this market, we are the beginning of a bear market in U.S stocks." ohhh boy no wait till he is stopped out and sell it

2260 2018-10-22 02:01:48 Infra stocks if not most many have a direct dependence on the party in power. Obviously they tend to swing either ways once in 5 years. It's an essential sector for the economy but highly competitive environment with tighter norms has made it liquidity deficit. Tide like pattern

2264 2018-10-22 01:51:16 And the economy itself will not be doing so well if the stocks continue to suffer- will it take another Recession like it did with Dubya before many people wake up? I know they aren't the same, but this is not a good sign for the future.

2278 2018-10-22 01:36:23 The extent of fall from the 52 wk highs don't automatically make stocks a BUY.

The highs happened under a different set of circumstances.

Infra stocks bought on 2008 on 30% dips only fell 60% more.

2296 2018-10-22 01:20:37 It’s truth but the worst truth in that news to read the prices of the stocks during at that time and even at such a high ( near to the high) so market has just find the sectors to make fresh highs but never ever over all sectorial life time in the market that’s really surprising
2297 2018-10-22 01:20:06 Another takeaway:

2301 2018-10-22 01:16:47 Recharging on a peaceful Sunday night, pleased to get laundry, groc shopping and vacuuming done, wondering how stocks will perform this week?
2302 2018-10-22 01:16:30 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to cure your carpal tunnel syndrome
2303 2018-10-22 01:14:22 You can also look at stocks that hold up relatively better when $SPX falls and that move up more when $SPX goes up, and vice versa.
2304 2018-10-22 01:13:33 Also look for sectors that are strong for the day, or you can look for stocks that don't correlate as directly with $SPX in times of chaos. If a stock does it's own thing then the set up is more trustworthy in case $SPX shits itself.

2306 2018-10-22 01:13:04 Yes. I do in stocks.

2308 2018-10-22 01:12:47 Stocks plunged as MeadWestvaco Corporation unveiled a condescending martini glass today.
2309 2018-10-22 01:12:32 Mil veces lo dije, según el club son stocks separados
2310 2018-10-22 01:11:41 I would suggest sorting the SPY500 by % gain and look at the strongest/weakest stocks. Then make sure they have actually made that progress without gap ups on news or earnings. Then you can see strength and try to play pullbacks or breakouts on those and vice versa.
2311 2018-10-22 01:10:40 You might not know this, but many, many people do not have 401-k’s. And no stocks at all. Do you know any regular people?

2314 2018-10-22 01:06:28 It should not be this hard to find somewhere that stocks Panasonic Eneloop batteries.
2315 2018-10-22 01:06:28 Looking into #stocks to buy. Wondering if anyone knows what is good to buy right now? I want to make sure that I invest correctly.
2316 2018-10-22 01:05:30 The 401 k’s will bite the dust sooner or later... it’s too fast of growth..Obama did a steady increase with the stocks. Unfortunately, stock market is as fabricated and inflated as your presidency. You’re trying to threaten to win.. Trump gangsta style. @CNN
2317 2018-10-22 01:04:56 - there is nothing that says that BTC *couldn't* have underperformed certain stocks in that period, especially if you count top-to-bottom like that
- if BTC goes to 3K, wouldn't it increase the % capacity that BTC could grow? why do you think alts would be more attractive then?
2318 2018-10-22 01:04:55 Don't get married to any investment.  All will go up and down.  Thinking it's time for anyone interested to begin looking at some transportation stocks that could start heading down.  The bigger names are $FDX $NSC $UNP $UPS $JBHT $KSU $CHRW $UAL $LSTR $CSX.

2326 2018-10-22 00:57:47 Yes. I just took a few stocks as examples
2327 2018-10-22 00:57:30 I invest the stocks are the best and invest in land and the marijuana industry is doing okay in Colorado Denver just passed a new law for more taxes on cannabis so I wouldn't invest in anything cannabis out of Colorado
2328 2018-10-22 00:57:00 Remember when Thomas Friedman told followers to dump stocks once he found out Trump won? Claimed the market would crash. A bunch of Chicken Littles on both sides.
2329 2018-10-22 00:55:38 $AMD good or bad' ER ? I don't know but thank you so much to Robinhood Trader I didn't buy $AMD last Friday was $26.69 just an hour b4 closing bell. If not now I'm a looooser. Thanks Robinhood Trader. U r the best. I think shouldn't trade with all Chinese stocks. None good at all

2346 2018-10-22 00:39:33 I guess I have to stop Trading stocks and invest in the freaking the EZ Pass Crooks cause  no one on wall Street can make $600 on a fucking $59 bill every time. Over 1000% return of unjustified administrative Fees. What other businesses can get away with this..

2348 2018-10-22 00:38:55 I've been investing in markets for 20+ years. Imagine thinking bitcoin market cycles don't follow the same pattern as other commodities and stocks. Cycles end in a bottoming period where support is tested over and over WITHOUT breaking down.
2349 2018-10-22 00:38:37 Dear Idiot, the Vulnerable Americans that you are screwing don't have beautiful 401K's or IRA's or any lovely stocks.  They are struggling to pay for utilities, medication and food.  FYS
2350 2018-10-22 00:38:21 Have you been trading pot stocks a lot?
2351 2018-10-22 00:36:08 Yes but we are close to retirement so we moved it out of stocks and bonds. Anticipating another crash.
2352 2018-10-22 00:35:34 Stocks is the way to go
2353 2018-10-22 00:33:35 But would a public company that shorts hope stocks and loses money outperform in this environment?
2354 2018-10-22 00:30:40 They been saying it and I see now, when you have only a handful of stocks to look toward to keep the market up, IS NOT A GOOD THING.
2355 2018-10-22 00:30:11 Yeah well why the fuck aint my pot stocks jumping..
2356 2018-10-22 00:28:33 I tell ya, the stadium ran out of chips! I payed $6 for some 'chips' (rating about 2) at a light show last night, what's up? we used to be a chip nation! who does fresh chips anymore? who stocks enough chips for supply! get chip put in fryer sell, how easy is that?
2357 2018-10-22 00:28:12 I am trying this gap down by with a small trade because I think Chinese will continue(try) to prop up their stock market. According to some Chinese research a lot of companies have put their shares as collateral for loans and most of those stocks have fallen to force-sale level.
2358 2018-10-22 00:26:35 Alpha-H changed their Liquid Gold packaging.... again! The white and gold is new.

This means I've used every version, from the time they had the plain white plastic to the grey and to the gold. But I still have stock so no new version in my stocks yet.
2359 2018-10-22 00:25:40 How to select the stocks n which strategies??
Pls
2360 2018-10-22 00:24:35 I’m a trader with no emotions. Short garbage & buy stocks that make money.
2361 2018-10-22 00:24:23 Chart is beginning to develop nice for another spike up in $VRUS / $RBIZ (After the decline recently).

All indicators I'm used to watching in a stock look to be in fairly good shape now. 

I will be watching closely this week.

2366 2018-10-22 00:18:35 From cutting up rocks to investing in stocks
2367 2018-10-22 00:16:24 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to improve your phantom limb syndrome
2368 2018-10-22 00:14:52 Sis, the basis of determining the richest person  is based on the  value of stocks quoted on a stock exchange. The higher the value and the higher the number of shares owned, the richer the owner is. Any African that invests wisely will be rich....follow the rules.

2369 2018-10-22 00:14:47 My 401 k is rock bottom and my money guy is trying to keep me calm.  Stocks,  real estate. Down. You are lying,  sir.
2370 2018-10-22 00:13:48 And how much does the next 10% own, and the 10% after that. Or simpler math, how Little stocks are owned by 70% of the population? 5%, 2%?
2371 2018-10-22 00:13:22 What I'm thinking about...
1) Google EU impact on TAC
2) Italy 
3) payments business in Brazil 
4) illiquid stocks in this market 
5) owning less ev/revs until what multiple 
6) Mickey and OTT
7) Gelsinger and Jassy

2376 2018-10-22 00:07:50 how could Trump brag about stock market? most stocks were cut 30% off
2377 2018-10-22 00:07:13 At least the Dems got the debt down. Ever time we get a GOP president, are national debt goes up. Under Obama job growth started and stocks were doing good. The only thing the GOP & Trump have done in 2yrs is give the rich a tax height and as usual F**ked the poor.
2378 2018-10-22 00:06:25 dow dropped! most stocks were cut off 30%  please brag
2379 2018-10-22 00:04:31 $SPY Seen stocks over $200.00 go to $40.00 and some thinking it's a steal, only to watch it go to practically nothing. Have an exit plan.
2380 2018-10-22 00:03:26 LOL, Yeah, everyone is RICH to buy stocks. Who cares about raising wages or making health care affordable. It was smart for corporations to buyback their stocks to get RICHER, instead of investing into their employee's benefits and giving raises.
2381 2018-10-22 00:02:29 twice this week I've been approached by really smart guys about the current risk being a massive unwind of the risk parity trade where both stocks and treasury bonds can fall together $TLT $SPY just wanted to share. been on my mind
