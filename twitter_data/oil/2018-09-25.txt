0 2018-09-25 23:59:58 2 Journos on #SkyNews today criticise Corbyn's Keynote speech today at Conference for one of his proposals to massivelly increase production of off-shore Wind Farms as bunkum - These Bozos don't seem to understand that windpower energy's now cheaper than coal/oil/nuclear #JC4PM
1 2018-09-25 23:59:16 Ingredients:
12-16 oz pasta
sliced garlic cloves (however many you want)
~1 Tbsp olive oil
red pepper flakes (you can determine if you want it milder or hotter)
1 lemon
1 bunch Italian (flat leaf) parsley

Sometimes I'll add some fresh-grated Parmesan
2 2018-09-25 23:59:15 Also part of the difference is that motorcycles — with the exception of some older, crusty Beemers and others — have a wet clutch that requires a slightly different class of oil/filter. Friction adjusting additives common in car oils will eventually seize a motorcycle clutch.
3 2018-09-25 23:58:56 Only if you like outright lying, not taking responsibility for his actions on the Iran sanctions and the price of oil. You can go on and on, he isn't an American

But then again Newt, your citizenship is in doubt as well.
4 2018-09-25 23:58:51 How much oil do we steal from the Russians?
5 2018-09-25 23:58:45 #crudeoil #brentoil maintain sell for oil despite all the noise. 80 to 83 is the supply levels, crude oil has registered a lower top against brent oil gives internal divergences. Brent oil Trgts 56 in 2 years and 13 to 18 dollars in next 4 years @PMOIndia #opec #shale
6 2018-09-25 23:58:38 "Critics of the oil & gas industry have asserted corps. are not properly accounting for their exposure to climate-related losses... Sanzillo said that if New York state’s pension fund embraces divestment, it can play a pivotal role in climate change fight b/c of its sheer size."-
7 2018-09-25 23:58:27 I know I'm thinking too much ... but the #Aldi olive oil #commercial is a critical #commentary on our #society.
8 2018-09-25 23:58:20 @Mangan150 would you consider DHA supplement a viable alternative to fish oil?
9 2018-09-25 23:58:16 Foda de estar fazendo tratamento contra acne é que td q tenho q usar agora tem q ser oil free. Só que essas porra são carassssss
10 2018-09-25 23:58:05 Pake baby oil
11 2018-09-25 23:58:00 Y'all 

I did not actually need to know the COMPLETE utility of olive oil, it was just a joke
12 2018-09-25 23:57:38 Were you running around that land of Apex/VF? There's lots of of money tied up in that platform and people who run their businesses on it from what I've seen. It's a lot like the oil fields... You can make mad money but your soul starts to hurt...
13 2018-09-25 23:57:35 Excuse @realDonaldTrump 
Quit screwing with OIL. $80 is a break even price and there are MANY interest charges involved. 
Oil runs this economy and your a;parent ignorance of the industry and how beat down it has been for the past 5 years is insulting. 
Energy Independence?

19 2018-09-25 23:56:21 It's @PepsiCo CEO @IndraNooyi's final week, but she still hasn't fixed Pepsi's #palmoil problem. I want her to save the #orangutans and leave a legacy free from #rainforest #deforestation & #workerabuse - by dropping palm oil villain @Indofood now!

40 2018-09-25 23:56:01 Dear @IndraNooyi I heard about Pepsi’s palm oil problem and I really hope that you’ll cut ties with @Indofood in your final week as CEO. I love #orangutans and our #rainforests too. Don’t let them die for cheap #palmoil
41 2018-09-25 23:55:57 Cool. Same coaches, different manager. Hit the road, Coconut Oil.
42 2018-09-25 23:55:55 What?! @PepsiCo STILL profits from exploitation #palmoil? Tell CEO @IndraNooyi to end her deals with palm oil villains @Indofood now
43 2018-09-25 23:55:49 Don’t like the taste of #deforestation and #humanrights abuse in your Pepsi? Join me and RT to tell @PepsiCo CEO @IndraNooyi to cut ties with deplorable palm oil business partner @Indofood in her final week as CEO
44 2018-09-25 23:55:37 It is your duty as minority member to be anti BJP, Anti Modi as you just don't want to remember that Manmohan had to float dangerous amt  of Oil bonds which was unsustainable on interest and repayment. But why remember when agenda is different?
45 2018-09-25 23:55:12 I just bought a huge tin of Spanish olive oil at wallyworld for $4 and I’m thriving.
46 2018-09-25 23:54:56 i have never heard of neem oil omg?
47 2018-09-25 23:54:41 Olive oil comes from France, right?
48 2018-09-25 23:54:37 A dash of sesame oil is also really good in that mix.

I'm doing the same with kale tonight.
49 2018-09-25 23:54:29 Oil
50 2018-09-25 23:54:13 She doesn’t care. Do you think where all the Iranian oil money goes? To pay these morons to suppprt the most evil regime. #IraniansSupportTrump #iranianswantregimechange
51 2018-09-25 23:54:03 Se vienen años duros. El escenario mundial ya no es favorable. @BankadaFP y @pcmperu deben sacar una Ley de HC que promueva INVERSIÓN RESPONSABLE. Lo evidente es que con Ley actual no se ha perforado un pozo, cada año producimos menos OIL y la izq no propone nada propositivo.
52 2018-09-25 23:53:57 I didn’t realize the Jordan College universe was a petroleum-based world in its Information Age until embarrassingly recently when I put together what “rock oil” was, and that they have “ordinators” at Oxford.

54 2018-09-25 23:53:35 She'll be fine, at that point hopefully she's a former premier of Alberta and will rejoin her anti oil friends.
55 2018-09-25 23:53:33 Only the snake oil salesman can make everyone who wears the same tie as me great again!
56 2018-09-25 23:53:12 Pasta aglio e olio.

Put salt in a pot of water, bring to boil, start cooking the pasta.

In a separate pan, add olive oil and start sauteing sliced garlic until the garlic becomes fragrant and starts to brown. Add some red pepper flakes and lower the heat until the pasta is done

60 2018-09-25 23:52:47 Maybe instead of striving for weapons you might try farming, opening a business, learning a trade, mining, fishing, drilling for oil if there is any there, etc; i.e., get busy with the business of living instead of living to kill other people.

62 2018-09-25 23:52:34 @arunjaitley If U can't control the oil prices and the stock market condition then in next may 2019 if U think U will come into power,then sorry it will not going to happen as people are angry due to hottness of petrol,Disel and automatic increasing inflation.
63 2018-09-25 23:52:32 Just like the GOP is bought & paid for by 1% donor class aligned with Putin & Big Oil, i guess the GOP women are bought & paid for by their GOP husbands. Both are nothing less than prostituting oneself.
64 2018-09-25 23:52:20 @realDonaldTrump Oil at $72 barrel. Higher interest rates. Growing inflation. I'm not confident. Just awaiting the fallout.
65 2018-09-25 23:52:19 Just as an added note to the current election circus: Peter Wall has told me he is not supporting Bremner any more because he doesn't like his housing plan. He is leaning towards Kennedy Stewart because he doesn't want oil tankers in the harbour.
66 2018-09-25 23:52:13 You noticed theres not even a spot of oil too? 
67 2018-09-25 23:52:03 The key line not uttered by JB was that the gas from this find would supply ALL of an independent Scotland's gas needs. @thesnp have selling point on gas there as well as oil. 10% of UK needs means it would easily supply ALL of Scotland's needs. Feel free to correct the editorial
68 2018-09-25 23:51:50 The NM GOP are practically sneering at the environmentalists, so ready to the bidding of their Lord and Master  - Big Oil. Hope the #BlueWave2018 washes right over them.
69 2018-09-25 23:51:44 Cleaned my whole house
Put argan & coconut oil in my hair
Applied a face mask
Ran an epsom salt & lavender bath
Read a book while soaking 
Scrubbed my entire body w sugar
Washed my hair and showered
And now I’m making bomb food

I’m feelin like a whole brand ass new human

71 2018-09-25 23:51:38 McDonald's has a better fry. Wendy's oil adds a different oil and it upsets my stomach.
72 2018-09-25 23:51:26 I change my oil like every other month or sooner, kill me.

80 2018-09-25 23:50:27 I have a doctors appointment for the oil . I have osteoarthritis both my knees , I tried everything injections you name it. I truly hope it works I don’t want surgery.
81 2018-09-25 23:50:14 LCHF got my TG down to 78. Had been as high as 170. Curious can you point me to info on the mechanism by which fish oil lowers TG?
82 2018-09-25 23:50:12 Oil and water
83 2018-09-25 23:50:01 @DinahMillerTX are you suggesting that a group (@TPPF) overseen by those who make millions in oil and gas would support policies that enrich oil and gas companies

While also attacking competitors of oil and gas companies (renewables)

Seems like quite a stretch?! #smh #txlege
84 2018-09-25 23:49:52 Brat supported a bill to ban presidents from blocking oil drilling on Continental Shelf.  #DaveBratDidThat
85 2018-09-25 23:49:44 I do not accept this name jojoba oil
86 2018-09-25 23:49:40 *watching Wonder Woman with my mom

mom: more like olive oil

I literally spit out my water
87 2018-09-25 23:49:24 I rarely agree with AM Joe, but I agree with this. No attempt by journalists to hide bias or present  complete info. Like snake oil salesmen/women

91 2018-09-25 23:49:04 so cute how complete dicks will name their organization "Protect Colorado" and all they want is to be able to drill for oil on your doorstep rather than 2500 feet away from it
92 2018-09-25 23:48:47 Titusville Girls Volleyball beats Oil City 25-7, 25-13, 25-7.
93 2018-09-25 23:48:43 what?  NAFTA is aweful.  Let it wither away.  Canada will be fine.  It will be able to control its OWN oil and resources as it sees fit.  Do you know under #NAFTA Canada is obliged to sell 75% of its oil to the #USA and 50% of its natural gas. Who signed off on that?
94 2018-09-25 23:48:40 , mmm I just bought some baby oil I can’t wait to shower tonight lmao
95 2018-09-25 23:48:29 Coconut oil & castor oil.
96 2018-09-25 23:48:27 Ah bummer :/

I was gonna recommend castor oil, but I wasn’t sure. Just looked it up for you though and yeah: Definitely do NOT get any castor oil!
97 2018-09-25 23:48:11 @RitzCrackers is one of the brands that are still buying dirty palm oil from rainforest destroyers! The first step to stop deforestation is to stop working with companies like Wilmar. #DropDirtyPalmOi

99 2018-09-25 23:48:02 You can do anything you want on borrowed money. Projected DEBT by your NDP is $96 BILLION dollars by 2023. Thank god you won’t last that long. How does $40 Million a DAY Oil revenue loss feel?? You don’t want the pipeline but you r addicted too spending. ONCE&DONE!
100 2018-09-25 23:47:59 Lady rockets win in 3 sets over oil city.  Nice job ladies!
101 2018-09-25 23:47:57 It may seem wasteful to you but it illustrates how valuable diluent is, and BTW I still believe oil-tanker rail cars to tidewater would be cheaper, faster, safer, easier than Northern Gateway would have been (partly cuz Kitimat's not an ideal oil port IMO tho it IS good for gas).
102 2018-09-25 23:47:55 To want Indy is natural, BREXIT was a vote for England's Independence to stop the gov from a different country  making some decisions for them  westminister does to this  Scotland only on a larger scale, all money made from  resources ,oil ect all goes straight to the treasury
103 2018-09-25 23:47:50 There are no results to date on the efficacy of pure EPA in the same population as REDUCE-IT.  Those other trials used fish oil supllements or Omega-3's; both of which have a high DHA content which the R-IT trial suggests is what makes V different than the the others.
104 2018-09-25 23:47:22 Venezuela ranks number 1 in oil reserves. Yet they are starving due to their socialism. BTW Exactly the government DEMS want for America
105 2018-09-25 23:47:12 Bought a cheap essential oil diffuser just to try it and I’m already obsessed. Why do I play such dangerous games
106 2018-09-25 23:47:12 Lol if you’re not already, try to put lotion on after your showers especially if youre using really hot water and you can always try using some hydrating oil. I use a vitamin E oil and that helps a lot. You can get some from TJ max for like $6
107 2018-09-25 23:47:06 I know but that’s what I thought coconut oil was Hahahaha

110 2018-09-25 23:46:51 I want to install heat wrap on my oil lines and wrap various engine doodads in thermal barrier near the turbocharger and downpipe, but turbo engines take like...hours to cool off D: The heat shroud burnt me, and it's been an hour ;_;
111 2018-09-25 23:46:49 @SohiAmarjeet if you had any common political sense you wd do the right thing and cross the floor to join the CPC. You live in a prov, ur community where Oil is the lifeblood of the economy.Its ur community-do what's right u will be a hero @CPC_HQ Trudeau doesn't care about u!
112 2018-09-25 23:46:16 You can shine leather shoes with a cloth and some vegetable oil.
113 2018-09-25 23:46:13 Hot oil treatment with my broads in let’s see how this goes ..

115 2018-09-25 23:45:59 Check your Engine oil this afternoon.
116 2018-09-25 23:45:44 I need a new car.. or maybe I just need  an oil change.
117 2018-09-25 23:44:56 I came in for an oil change now they got me looking at brand new cars 
118 2018-09-25 23:44:54 Again, we are aware that your preferred method of debate is ad hominem (logical fallacy).  You can continue with that but it's boring. 

Explain how the geological timescale, implied by evo, helps us find oil better than understanding what stage of the Flood deposited layers.
119 2018-09-25 23:44:53 These people including Miss May are to stupid to realise that Washington State wants our oil land locked so they can continue to make huge profits off our steeply discounted oil. FTM...  Follow The  Money
120 2018-09-25 23:44:46 I don't really know what to post, so I'm just gonna post a recipe on how to fry dodo

 Salt
Cut plantain add salt
Put oil in pan
Add salted plantain

122 2018-09-25 23:44:39 So you are saying OPEC cut back. Cause we are out pumping them? Supply and demand or inflation? To much oil means it's cheaper? Just asking cause I would like to know.

128 2018-09-25 23:43:25 According to the company they will throw off tons of cash in the out years of their five year plan.  What is the catch?  At 70 oil and 2.75 they should do fine according to company.  What are they lying about
129 2018-09-25 23:43:23 Yea well it’s too bad the republicans are. We havent responded to either of the countries that have actually attacked us since Pearl Harbor, Saudi Arabia and Russia. Saudi Arabia is responsible for 9/11 and financed it. Republicans have too much oil business there to do anything

131 2018-09-25 23:43:10 You could of made it mandatory that the trains in your state Jay, that had bladders in them! That’s what Sprint Cars have in their fuel tanks so if the get upside down the fuel doesn’t leak out! Ships carry crude oil should also have bladders!!!

138 2018-09-25 23:42:34 Bye the way how long you been working in the industry ? Ever heard of oil company out of Dallas Tx called The Southwestern Oil Company from around the turn of the century 1900?
139 2018-09-25 23:42:17 Faith feeds on the impossible. How can a last jar of oil fill 4 barrels? If the woman had borrowed 1m barrels, do you know the 1m barrels would have been filled? How can someone not see death(Enoch). Faith feeds on the unbelievable. Faith speaks “overflow”, not “brim”
140 2018-09-25 23:42:17 all ya need is some wax, a double boiler (pots than can stack and the top one has the wax, bottom has the water. or get a pouring pot and put it in the pot of boiling water) melt the wax, put at least 1 oz of a fragrance or essential oil in it and let it set. you’re golden.

142 2018-09-25 23:41:37 No I'm serious.
Dear citizens of the US of A.
What in the fucking universe ever compels you to put something rolled in batter and fried in a bucket of oil inside your body, let alone if that something is in itself already diabetes fuel?
Explain. Why not just blow your brains out.
143 2018-09-25 23:41:26 Friendlings, I'm going to sleep soon, but our of curiosity, does anyone take CBD oil for anxiety/depression? Do you have drops or capsules? Thoughts? Ta xo
144 2018-09-25 23:41:25 In reality, if I don't keep tabs on things, I can get really clumsy and sloppy.

(For instance, the color of the oil that drained out told me that I should have changed it a bit sooner. Probably reflects that I have to ride it at fairly high revs to get around the freeways.)
145 2018-09-25 23:40:49 World confidence dropped another 50 points today when they all laughed at your lie!
German group laughing at your crazy oil story re Russia.Iran laughing that you said you were invited by them....never happened.
Laughing at your Opec statement. Laughing re Kim praise..
146 2018-09-25 23:40:48 I can never read "Brent crude" without laughing. I'm glad I'm not an oil trader.
147 2018-09-25 23:40:36 I’m guessing Iran is the new stepchild.  Try not to fuck this up U.N...  they got oil, which means someone desperately needs freedom and democracy.
148 2018-09-25 23:40:36 What fool it’s already baked in. Corn & oil subsidies. Social Security, Medicare, disability.
149 2018-09-25 23:40:34 In oil and gas some technology providers demand 25 year term and get it.  Crazy!

153 2018-09-25 23:40:17 When does the U.S. stop with the aggressive attitude and actions towards other countries? This has to stop. Venezuela is oil rich. It has almost every UK and U.S. oil company there. That's not enough dickie Cheney?

155 2018-09-25 23:40:06 Like Hillary worked her way up, was Senator etc. There has never been anyone with such a stellar job resume. But for all the good it did her. A snake oil salesman robbed her.
156 2018-09-25 23:40:00 Use a little olive oil on the end of a Q-tip to remove eyeliner (and it won't sting if it gets in your eyes)
157 2018-09-25 23:39:56 I also know that back in the oil boom family I have that worked in the industry said they capped off wells in Texas to preserve The US oil. So many that it would alone supply us 100+ years so I know Texas has the oil but their not pumping but a fraction of it

162 2018-09-25 23:38:47 Yeah. I can definitely see myself doing a candle with the African Musk oil I be wearing. Every person I've dated always told me they loved when I would come over/spennanight because my smell would linger in their fabrics (couches/sheets). You gon' smell me, nigga!
163 2018-09-25 23:38:42 I have eczema so I be taking a bath and putting baby oil or skin so soft in my bath water and it really does wonders
164 2018-09-25 23:38:34 So if they disagree with your viewpoint it is therefore not a fact?

I think history shows us a lot of viewpoints. For example, trade wars lead to real wars. The USA cutting imperial Japan off from oil.

Stronger boarder = stronger economy. Australia. 

Your emotions are showing.

207 2018-09-25 23:33:28 Bounce back on Tue does not mean recovery has arrived. Oil prices still moving up. One needs to wait and watch where brent is heading. It does not seem either side  in this oil war is willing to talk and bring prices down

220 2018-09-25 23:31:50 Not all true. EIA 2/3 of price crude oil price the rest up to 11 factors taxing, market, refining, demand and sentiment toward oil futures contracts,  traded heavily by speculators play a dominant role in price. Man player =OPEC not supply/demand

Meanwhile, Nigeria will be just there, "looking like Lucozade".

Time for us to leave OPEC?
234 2018-09-25 23:29:43 I agree with you 100% on that one.Its a good time to get rid of our own reliance on oil then we wouldn’t have to. Cap and trade was going to do that but Ford is putting an axe to it,now were going to have to pay a higher carbon tax.

252 2018-09-25 23:27:23 WE’RE NOT JUST SOMEONE’S DAUGHTER, WE’RE PEOPLE TOO! I take full offense to this but yeah I should probably go in for an oil change like two weeks ago
253 2018-09-25 23:27:13 I’m not a climate denier. I’m just smart enough to know that reduction of CDN oil DOESN’T reduce demand. The void is just filled by another country (usually with worse enviro standards). Such was the case when Venezuela had production problems - OPEC increased production.
254 2018-09-25 23:27:07 And by the way Germany is not dependent on Russian oil. Laughingstock at the United Nations.
255 2018-09-25 23:26:47 Side effects are hitting harder than ever, but I’m attributing that to oil glands actually drying out forever (which is the goal of the med). Ultimately depends on how you feel about it—it’s one of my 2 huge insecurities so I wanted to get it fixed BAD

268 2018-09-25 23:24:31 They acting like my Bamry a luxury bruh. Lmfao $100 for an oil change and now $700 for REGULAR tires. I damn near don’t want a luxury no mo.
269 2018-09-25 23:24:26 I love olive oil!
270 2018-09-25 23:24:25 Yep! Not like he ordered them to get the new, better train cars safety inspectors have been trying to get oil & train companies to get that are needed.
271 2018-09-25 23:24:17 I think Trump's speech about Iran would be true...if you replaced "Iran" with "Saudi Arabia".  Why doesn't the US soften it's stance on Iran, accept oil from them, pitch Saudi Arabia and give them to China?  Then China gets the poison pill that is Saudi Arabia funding Terrorism.
272 2018-09-25 23:23:59 The way Manutd is going down ehn! We will soon discover oil
273 2018-09-25 23:23:53 Welcome to Oil Country!
274 2018-09-25 23:23:47 It would. That is why they always frame it that way. Ethical oil and all that. It's at odds with their "free market" beliefs and the truth though. Just a propaganda scam like preemptive "self defense", Reveals they know right from wrong as they choose wrong.
275 2018-09-25 23:23:26 I was using oil blotting sheets and my bf came over to ask if they were rolling papers 
276 2018-09-25 23:23:20 The film we just played about their business... SMH I'm ready to quit my job and go paint an ocean or something. 

He is a fine olive oil personified (in the best way)
277 2018-09-25 23:23:12 No. It is not because of a foreign language. It is almost identical to the Niger Delta crisis. It is due to decades of neglect - and that region of Cameroon is also the major oil producing region.
278 2018-09-25 23:22:59 Pepsi profits from dirty palm oil. Unless CEO @IndraNooyi takes responsibility and ends @PepsiCo’s business deal with #palmoil offender @Indofood, Pepsi will continue to prop up the destruction of Indonesia’s #rainforests and #orangutans
279 2018-09-25 23:22:54 the higher the oil price the better.
280 2018-09-25 23:22:35 I’m really surprised my car is alive I never check the oil, tires or whatever is blinking 
281 2018-09-25 23:22:35 I like shitaki mushrooms, garlic and olive oil and green pepper with potato and cheese pierogies.
That’s my go to.
282 2018-09-25 23:22:25 Not necessarily, but the KSA is obligated to supply more oil into the market with lower prices to fill the market gap of the countries buying oil from Iran so that they won’t need Iran’s oil anymore
283 2018-09-25 23:22:15 olive oil actually works as lube if you don't have anything else

418 2018-09-25 23:05:37 As someone with stage 4 endometriosis, my advice is, if you’re having bad period pain, ignore these snake oil merchants and see a doctor. And keep seeing them until you get help. And also buy your sanitary products from a company who don’t think the word “women” is offensive.

420 2018-09-25 23:05:24 Shampooing/conditioning your facial hair is so important, I use a balm instead of oil that’s like a moisturiser consistency I just find it a lot less temperamental than beard oil. Once a week I like comb it with a brush when I’m shampooing it to help exfoliate
421 2018-09-25 23:05:22 I need some beard oil...
422 2018-09-25 23:05:19 #PalmOil is causing havoc to Indonesian forests & wildlife. @PepsiCo is fuelling this, through business partnership with one of the industry’s worst offenders @Indofood. RT to join me in calling on CEO @IndraNooyi to end Pepsi’s palm oil crimes

426 2018-09-25 23:04:56 Pepsi profits from dirty palm oil. Unless CEO @IndraNooyi takes responsibility and ends @PepsiCo’s business deal with #palmoil offender @Indofood, Pepsi will continue to prop up the destruction of Indonesia’s #rainforests and #orangutans
427 2018-09-25 23:04:55 Nobody sees any possibility of $200 oil but it's coming. Not based on supply & demand but based on a breakdown in USD. I said $60 before $40 then said $80 before $60 & that miners needed to hedge diesel not gold (while most funds bought into "Lower for Longer") Reckoning coming.
428 2018-09-25 23:04:38 Should be interesting considering India's plan to cut imports of Iranian oil to zero from November.

430 2018-09-25 23:04:20 It is the fundamental reason why, even though I'm no longer Labour I could never be Tory.

470 2018-09-25 22:59:49 Lol. What you listed are valid points economically but not enough to push you into a recession. Our years of excessive & reckless spending coupled with lack of saving and drop in oil prices made us vulnerable to recession.

473 2018-09-25 22:59:40 It doesn't matter if you are paid to tweet or not. Your tweets represent the worst of the anti-Trump movement. You're selling political snake oil rather than actually using your journalistic skills/platform to discuss the issues that affect oppressed people in this country daily.
474 2018-09-25 22:59:37 I’ll give you a win for the dumbest thing I’ve read on twitter. Speculation as to where oil, coal, gold and uranium come from. So tell me why I should believe anything you say on climate change vs Jim Hanson who has actually studied climate change.

535 2018-09-25 22:48:23 Honestly though, If you think countries get to produce as much oil as they want pls kill yourself. 

Venezuela possibly has the highest reserves in the world rn, but you won't see them producing 10mm bbl/day that's if they can even produce half of that
536 2018-09-25 22:48:13 girl, where do you get your oil changed at?
537 2018-09-25 22:48:12 if they are uk waters why did blair need to change the border on the south east coast of scotland so that english waters could gain control of a number of oil wells with the profits going directly to westminster just before devolution?

547 2018-09-25 22:46:48 It’s curious - for such a flawed currency, big oil exporters have wanted to price in EUR an awful lot pretty much since inception, & the US has had a fit about those exporters trying to do so an awful lot...
548 2018-09-25 22:46:36 Fresh tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, olive oil
549 2018-09-25 22:46:28 So that's a gross value of £230m/year over 10 years for JUST ONE GAS FIELD. That is in no way, shape or form insignificant, especially given that  countires like England for example can do fine having hardly any oil or gas, which is after all seen as a bonus.
550 2018-09-25 22:45:56 I use tree oil shampoo. It helps so much.
551 2018-09-25 22:45:46 I'm sure Russia and China will be happy to 'defend' Middle East oil for 'nothing' if the US is tired of doing so
552 2018-09-25 22:45:35 My favorite feeling in the world is driving my car after an oil change lmao
553 2018-09-25 22:45:30 I use a lemon sugar scrub. You could probably make your own easily. That or try tea tree oil
554 2018-09-25 22:45:27 That's when the laughing started. When #Trump opened his mouth at the #UN. German's were more overt about it when he tried to sell them US oil. EVERYONE in the world knows how he treats partners and allies.
555 2018-09-25 22:45:21 In other words, in the event of a EUR “crash”, the world may find itself surprised by the sudden willingness of major oil exporters to sell in...EUR.  Witness Iraq in 2000...Iran in 2012...Russia now perhaps?
556 2018-09-25 22:45:14 Its up to you. But I do home hot oil treatments with tea tree oil , organic coconut oil or with Jamaican castor oil
557 2018-09-25 22:45:00 @RitzCrackers is one of the brands that are still buying dirty palm oil from rainforest destroyers! The first step to stop deforestation is to stop working with companies like Wilmar. #DropDirtyPalmOi
558 2018-09-25 22:44:55 Hello, I am a Power Rangers fan from USA. Do you think Silicon Maintenance Oil would prevent this from breaking?
559 2018-09-25 22:44:52 Had a great president meh, more like a great snake oil salesman!
560 2018-09-25 22:44:52 But L/T, oil going way higher imo
561 2018-09-25 22:44:50 If you see an artist that does oil paintings in a realistic style, don't ask them for a color blocked abstract acrylic.
562 2018-09-25 22:44:44 Anybody at State get the strategic point the US isn't in the Middle East *just* to defend oil and certainly not to defend it for US use?
563 2018-09-25 22:44:42 Every time I see this britnat shit, I always think the wonderful benevolence of the English people buying Scottish goods and services when they could get them cheaper somewhere else. Where can  England get cheaper oil, whisky, electricity,  salmon  etc. Asking for a friend.
564 2018-09-25 22:44:40 I hereby declare that anyone who doesn't understand how Oil is produced can never talk about it again

566 2018-09-25 22:44:33 Gawd elp us!! Be kind on the chins dear! Especially if you taking snaps on the front row!!! It’s not the BFI it’s tiny!!! Remember “A drag queen's like an oil painting: You gotta stand back from it to get the full effect.” If Say about 20 rows back in the pitch black!!! Lol xxxx
567 2018-09-25 22:44:18 As Dan Bongino said it would happen. She’s not credible enough to destiny. Do not put Kavanaugh or Judge on to be questioned until she is questioned. #showusthepolygraph #ConfirmKavanaughNow
568 2018-09-25 22:44:09 All valid points for sure. My charts are very bullish oil, north of $90 in coming months. Pullbacks may be shallow, although the alternate count is a deeper correction into $60s, so time will tell.
569 2018-09-25 22:43:53 Chi Silk Infusion oil or Chi Iron Guard 
570 2018-09-25 22:43:42 Crude oil price hikes.
Oil Price over $80 a barrel.
571 2018-09-25 22:43:41 Bolton suffers from oil envy!
572 2018-09-25 22:43:35 How? Haven't seen him stand up to Saudi Arabia after they orchestrated 9/11 or were found to be funneling money to ISIS. Or do we forgive countries that attack and kill our fellow Americans because they give us oil? 
573 2018-09-25 22:43:20 With the US becoming the second largest exporter of oil and gas?
574 2018-09-25 22:43:10 Dick Cheney is on the board of Genie Oil/Energy- they are Drilling in the Golan Heights. It's not just a pipeline...
575 2018-09-25 22:43:08 & that’s box be slippery like tryna walk on oil.
576 2018-09-25 22:42:58 What kind of oil???
577 2018-09-25 22:42:51 The Alberta NDP has sent 2 people who have in the past been totally against Oil Industry development. Trying to earn votes so the will attempt to pass as pro development.
578 2018-09-25 22:42:48 The #rainforests are our planet’s beating heart & the #orangutans that swing in the trees of #Indonesia are one of its most precious creatures. Don’t let dirty #palmoil destroy this. I’m calling on @PepsiCo’s CEO @IndraNooyi to stop dealing with palm oil villain @Indofood
579 2018-09-25 22:42:45 I'm trying CBD oil for the first time on Friday. I usually make my own buttttttttt  the oil that I make gets you super high and I need something that doesn't make me high during the day at work. Plus I'm trying to quit smoking for good.
580 2018-09-25 22:42:33 Ah....so the Planned Parenthood PAC is spending $30 million.  And that org is privately funded and different than the Planned Parenthood clinics.  So what's the big deal?  Are people mad about the oil and gas, tobacco, and pharma pacs too?
581 2018-09-25 22:42:31 Ghana 1 liter = Cedi 5.12 = INR 76.8; not to forget the country has huge oil nd Gas reserves .
582 2018-09-25 22:42:28 Unfortunately my skin hates frankincense. I'm trying rose hip oil and seeing how my skin reacts to that
583 2018-09-25 22:42:23 I think it’s an oil mixed with wax but Armani doesn’t have that oil. I probably would never make it anyways lol but I would buy it
584 2018-09-25 22:42:14 Dear @IndraNooyi I heard about Pepsi’s palm oil problem and I really hope that you’ll cut ties with @Indofood in your final week as CEO. I love #orangutans and our #rainforests too. Don’t let them die for cheap #palmoil
585 2018-09-25 22:42:14 Great cookbooks from Greece , Italy , Spain and our own local Farmers Market Cookbook by Doug Merriam . Fabulous recipes with olive oil and vinegars  a must have for the everyday cook  
586 2018-09-25 22:41:59 For you I suggest hemp oil. It doesnt fight cancer but its good for inflammation, anxiety, etc. Easily accessible.
587 2018-09-25 22:41:55 اقسم بالله العظيم لن يحرر الاقصى الا المهدي واتباعه المجاهدين وعيسى عليه السلام.
588 2018-09-25 22:41:52 Oil was already peeking above $70 by January 2018, after about half a year’s steady rise? So the market called Trump’s Iran withdrawal a year before? I don’t think so. In fact, commodity hedge funds that bet on rising prices back then will tell you the same story I am.
589 2018-09-25 22:41:44 Dear @IndraNooyi I heard about Pepsi’s palm oil problem and I really hope that you’ll cut ties with @Indofood in your final week as CEO. I love #orangutans and our #rainforests too. Don’t let them die for cheap #palmoil
590 2018-09-25 22:41:44 The Government's decision to end offshore oil and gas exploration could cost nearly $8 billion in lost tax over 23 years, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) has warned.

593 2018-09-25 22:41:28 That works. 
594 2018-09-25 22:41:26 Enjoy the patchouli oil
595 2018-09-25 22:41:23 The issue is that what WM wants is not possible to EU. They prefer economic ruin to a risk of Scotland seeing that being in a Ireland/N.I border relationship is possible.  
It ruins a guards at border argument. The economic case for staying is lost but never mention oil prices!
596 2018-09-25 22:41:21 Use palm oil
597 2018-09-25 22:41:12 Here's really the thing: The guy who never has a bad word to say about Putin gets laughed at by the Germans for putting Germany first and building a pipeline that will put downward pressure on oil prices.  Liz is in love and love is blind.
598 2018-09-25 22:40:47 Chocolate Applesauce Cake:

And it grows your hair much faster.
600 2018-09-25 22:40:36 Getting the first oil change in Jenns Jeep at Valvoline, freakin 100 bucks for full synthetic! It used to be cheaper than doing it myself, I’ll have to recheck that! #highwayrobbery

602 2018-09-25 22:40:25 If remain had won, it was a vote to maintain the status quo, although there would have still been a sizeable mandate to suggest people seemingly had beef with the EU. 

would be interesting to know what % age had their EU beliefs brainwashed into them by the snake oil salesmen.
603 2018-09-25 22:40:13 Did you know that Pepsi has a palm oil problem? I want @IndraNooyi, the CEO of @PepsiCo to take responsibility for destroying #orangutans precious rainforest home and end her deals with dodgy #palmoil company @Indofood today!
604 2018-09-25 22:40:12 I never got an oil change with my first car. I didnt know that was a thing. Destroyed my sweet Jetta in four years!
605 2018-09-25 22:40:07 迷うなあサラダ油なの？ごま油なの？どっちが好きなの？
606 2018-09-25 22:40:07 If only we'd let Mossadegh rule a democratic government and nationalise Iran's oil, the world would be very different don't you think?
607 2018-09-25 22:40:05 YES i want to be a sales marketer for the oil it’s insanity!!!!!!
608 2018-09-25 22:40:03 Sugar free Brownies and cinnamon swirl bread in the oven , I felt like baking and by baking I mean opening the box and adding water oil and eggs #idontbake
609 2018-09-25 22:40:00 Olive oil and grapeseed oil have antioxidants that will help remove lotion. It will also help prevent breakouts.
610 2018-09-25 22:39:57 The world should just sanction us back, and I mean a full house, and go slap slap you go to the mat and bingo bango, no oil, no extra food, no tea from india or china, No buy US T bonds, No buy land, no pay mortgages on land, fire sell all US comp stocks.  They could do it
611 2018-09-25 22:39:43 Peppermint oil gives me heartburn but I still take it everyday bc if anything can help with the pain I'd be so grateful
612 2018-09-25 22:39:39 More oil! More asbestos! More methane! Long live Trump!
613 2018-09-25 22:39:34 Why they let the fires go.. $$$ oil, mining and fracking. GOP isn't the party that cleans up this stuff they reduce our parks and sell off/lease to big oil/mining/and fracking co. They'll put the cattleman on what's LEFT at the price of our wild animals!
614 2018-09-25 22:39:19 @Rendon63rd doesn't care about nature and people. He shelved SB 562 - The Healthy CA Act.

@JerryBrownGov invested in hydraulic fracking and oil drilling, destroying ecosystems for generations. He just authorized PG&E to shift cost of their failures to taxpayers.
615 2018-09-25 22:39:18 It's just CBD oil

617 2018-09-25 22:39:04 It's just CBD oil
618 2018-09-25 22:39:02 Excellent question @KingDaveyTO -- and thanks so much for opening my eyes @VictorCleaner -- I knew gold price was highly linked to oil price based on Steve St Angelo's @SRSroccoReport work, but I had no idea the depth things went to. My sincere gratitude.
619 2018-09-25 22:39:01 You'd have to use fragrance oil alternatives to the frag you want
620 2018-09-25 22:39:01 I really need a oil change this shit not even funny anymore lmaoooo
621 2018-09-25 22:38:55 Frankincense oil for healing scars!
622 2018-09-25 22:38:51 Ok I’m gonna try CBD oil. Imma get that shit TUHMORROW
623 2018-09-25 22:38:49 The real question here is how the world owners (wall streat bankers, oil company share holders, Bill Gates and others, all world presidents are just puppets to them anyway )  are planing to keap control once trump gets put un prison.
624 2018-09-25 22:38:19 I guess he hasn't figured out that these countries will simply raise oil prices even more to pay for our protection.
625 2018-09-25 22:38:17 Saute it with whole garlic and olive oil, salt and pepper to taste. Then, take the bubbly and carefully (this part is important) insert it into your rectum cavity and bounce up and down. YW.
626 2018-09-25 22:38:14 Tops basting oil is lifeee. Gonna be putting that shit on everything I cook
627 2018-09-25 22:38:13 @Ritzcrackers Take a look at where your palm oil comes from! Old-growth forests in Indonesia or Malaysia were probably cleared to produce it!
628 2018-09-25 22:38:12 Really that shouldn't take to long to figurevtgat one out , then they can move on to why our oil is still in the ground, it sure as he'll count the  back into dinosaurs,  or are they wishing,and be sure to vote
629 2018-09-25 22:38:05 ....it just feels like we’re due for an oil spill
630 2018-09-25 22:38:03 ppl that use their social media to sell keto coffee or avacado hair oil can u get a normal job that doesn’t involve spamming my feeds
631 2018-09-25 22:37:21 @thriftthick Can I give u some advice that helped me to control my oily skin. Moisturiser, anything that have oils (expect tea tree and aloe Vera oil) just avoid. 
I found out from @gossmakeupartis he’s really good. 
Primers are still good tho.
632 2018-09-25 22:37:19 Omg I actually saw a yt video of a girl putting tea tree oil in her homemade charcoal peel off mask and her skin was RED and looked bad... put some aloe if you have it will help
633 2018-09-25 22:37:14 you look so tan rita... wish i was there to rub you down with some more tanning oil
634 2018-09-25 22:37:06 I need a new face cream. the bish right here uses Tea tree oil and Vaseline as a lotion 
635 2018-09-25 22:36:59 Sniffing my new doterra oil and sipping blood orange San Pellegrino while watching The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes starring Basil Rathbone. This is the the happiest I’ve been in a long while.
636 2018-09-25 22:36:50 Totally agree as much snake oil peddling out there with expensive unproven treatments. People sadly will pay a lot for “alternative” therapy. Plenty of people out to take their money.
637 2018-09-25 22:36:45 Is it oily? Do you apply is all over your face or just to the scars? My skin breaks outs easily with oil
638 2018-09-25 22:36:30 Try out our new line of beard products from @thecladstache. Beard balm, oil and more.

639 2018-09-25 22:36:22 I would be more than happy to keep your feet warm. Suck on your toes rub them with hot oil sit on them
640 2018-09-25 22:35:51 [making pasta]

olive oil is just noodle lube

642 2018-09-25 22:35:32 Nope we have 3 copper pans and they live up to their name. DO NOT use cooking spray, you will ruin them. Butter or oil only.
643 2018-09-25 22:35:29 I been saying I wanna start to learn oil painting 
644 2018-09-25 22:35:26 You blame liberals because you are shallow enough to support a member of the Russia Mafia? You blame liberals because you can't bear to admit that you made a mistake by supporting a con man... a snake oil salesman? Well liberals blame you for the mess the country is in. Begone!
645 2018-09-25 22:35:11 We could adopt SKs tax structure and see how that pans out. If I recall correctly, someone did the math and we wouldn’t have a deficit. So far as cuts, I’d like to see MLA salaries in half and a cap on all public salaries. We don’t need to compete w/oil industry anymore.
646 2018-09-25 22:35:06 I've hear that black seed oil helps hair to grow, is there any truth in it?
647 2018-09-25 22:35:04 As a beauty therapist my personal internal faves are evening primrose oil capsules (essential fatty acids are a MUST for a healthy skin barrier), liquid chlorophyll for good gut health, zinc for healthy blood and to help keep away breakouts. 
648 2018-09-25 22:35:04 It's @PepsiCo CEO @IndraNooyi's final week, but she still hasn't fixed Pepsi's #palmoil problem. I want her to save the #orangutans and leave a legacy free from #rainforest #deforestation & #workerabuse - by dropping palm oil villain @Indofood now!
649 2018-09-25 22:35:01 Shebi our dindinrin reps be like figure heads after 3 terms you no fit hold solid ground for house of Assembly now he's seeking 4th term, he brought celebrities (liz da silva and pasuma) to do stupid walk for oilfor 4th term .

657 2018-09-25 22:33:46 All these memes about check engine lights being on forever made me realize I need an oil change. Thx.
658 2018-09-25 22:33:24 Really put yourself in a good mood
For me, I force myself to get up, turn on my oil burners, play music that takes me to a great place or have good memories behind them, and really relax
659 2018-09-25 22:33:21 #PalmOil is causing havoc to Indonesian forests & wildlife. @PepsiCo is fuelling this, through business partnership with one of the industry’s worst offenders @Indofood. RT to join me in calling on CEO @IndraNooyi to end Pepsi’s palm oil crimes
660 2018-09-25 22:33:07 When your arm smells like oil.
661 2018-09-25 22:33:05 I soften the blow to waitstaff -- or hosts in homes -- by telling them my allergy triggers are kryptonite. It goes from starting off light-hearted to "this guy's serious." Restaurants are very accommodating, given what a pain I am: olive oil, soy sauce, aged cheeses, and more
662 2018-09-25 22:33:05 Oil cleanser, toner, serum, resurfacing masks, nighttime repairing creams
663 2018-09-25 22:32:37 The US has troops in Syria right Now 'illegally" they have a number of bases.

668 2018-09-25 22:31:57 It’s the oil that matters
669 2018-09-25 22:31:50 Nabil Gabol can’t even handle a bottle of Olive Oil, please start something light.
670 2018-09-25 22:31:48 @FoxNews @CNN  great work by @POTUS putting our enemies & our allies on notice that we r tired of carrying the load for the world. Iran is our enemy & they support terrorism, yet Obama gave them $1 billion. Saudi Arabia is our ally & they continue to gouge us w hi oil prices.
671 2018-09-25 22:31:45 @realDonaldTrump Brave and finish the work of this Iranian regime's damaging oil by November, I emphasize that this is vital to us and you.
672 2018-09-25 22:31:16 I wish Trump had the balls to blockade Iranian oil shipments.
673 2018-09-25 22:31:13 yeah, like Corn Chip Addiction!!!!! or Castor Oil Addiction!!!!!
674 2018-09-25 22:30:59 Piece of mail: “oh no prop 112 will kill jobs by restricting how close oil drilling can be to occupied buildings!”
Me: “then perish”
675 2018-09-25 22:30:50 French President Emmanuel Macron responded to U.S. President Donald Trump’s criticism of high oil prices, saying that if had not reimposed sanctions on Tehran, prices would not have risen as much.
676 2018-09-25 22:30:47 I would say buy stock in technology or penny stocks don't waste time in failing industries such as oil/gas/natural resources

684 2018-09-25 22:29:53 I hate porn where they cover the girl in baby oil. Is this like a real thing? I can't even begin to imagine ever ending up in a situation like that.
685 2018-09-25 22:29:48 Oil companies cracking the whip on employees to get same production they got before the crash.....,while the top layer cream it in.
686 2018-09-25 22:29:46 Good point. I should have said oil sands
687 2018-09-25 22:29:44 I had to look that up! Only the olive oil was a part of this dish.
688 2018-09-25 22:29:37 Doesn't tea tree oil smell really strong though?
689 2018-09-25 22:29:32 I have free oil changes till 2022 or 60k miles. I’m barely at 13k 
690 2018-09-25 22:29:18 I hate getting my oil changed because I’m already rehearsing how I’m going to act surprised when they say I need a whole bunch of stuff I can’t afford 
691 2018-09-25 22:29:11 So Dunkin Donuts is changing it's name so customers will know they have Coffee too? 
I guess they'll be called "Dunkin Motor Oil" then.

694 2018-09-25 22:28:59 Don’t like the taste of #deforestation and #humanrights abuse in your Pepsi? Join me and RT to tell @PepsiCo CEO @IndraNooyi to cut ties with deplorable palm oil business partner @Indofood in her final week as CEO
695 2018-09-25 22:28:51 This isn't really a 2 cent increase in the gasoline price. The oil companies are just starting to take back the fake decrease they temporarily allowed Adolph Stalin Ford to take credit for as a result of killing cap and trade.
696 2018-09-25 22:28:38 As you pointed out, the new Phones price INCREASED 19%!!! Where is Trumps outrage??? He only plays wack-a-Mole with Oil and Biotech companies??
697 2018-09-25 22:28:35 @realDonaldTrump If you want to do a great job, you have to pay a little, and really it costs it. The result will be global peace, do not forget this. We need to unite and make sure that Iran's oil exports reach zero by November 4,
698 2018-09-25 22:28:28 窓開けっ放しで寝たら寒すぎて喉やられた仮面です
おはようございます
699 2018-09-25 22:28:19 My hair is definitely nappy.. & I love it but it gets tangled...webbed up & can shed.. castor oil has helped me with moisture though.
700 2018-09-25 22:28:04 Lol fair enough! Have a great race at Oil Creek!
701 2018-09-25 22:28:04 Oh, you greedy bastards. I do hope you follow through on your threat to try your luck in Alaska. “he repeated a threat to move the shipping point of the project to Alaska if the federal government approves Bill C-68, which would ban oil tankers from loading on the north coast.”
702 2018-09-25 22:28:00 @realDonaldTrump this rise in oil prices will also be temporary. When Iran's oil is completely cut off in November, then the countries will increase the supply of oil and the price will be lowered, it will be a temporary rise in oil prices
703 2018-09-25 22:27:50 The two things I see in favour of lower oil is that Iran gets to supply Europe with a new payment system and Venezuela production not likely to fall much from here as China is invested in their oil output. So supply side is somewhat stabilised.
704 2018-09-25 22:27:46 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
705 2018-09-25 22:27:37 Dear @IndraNooyi I heard about Pepsi’s palm oil problem and I really hope that you’ll cut ties with @Indofood in your final week as CEO. I love #orangutans and our #rainforests too. Don’t let them die for cheap #palmoil
706 2018-09-25 22:27:28 What objective evidence suggest so? There isn’t one thing I can price the long bond in on a relative basis that isn’t downright scary. Try it! Price it in every curency. Price it relative to stocks, oil, etc... Bonds are a disaster IMO
707 2018-09-25 22:27:20 500mg CBD oil and a vape pen. Thank me later.
708 2018-09-25 22:26:56 @realDonaldTrump Do not worry,President Trump,about the price of oil. st's a little cost when you want to overthrow the biggest supporter of terrorism,so that the world is breathless.This small cost maybe the price of oil is $ 100, but worth it. Of course, it will not reach $ 100
709 2018-09-25 22:26:47 Just bought beard oil, might take this beard seriously 
710 2018-09-25 22:26:41 ここ２～３日涼しいのでウチを含め窓を開けて寝てる家が多いのですが、よそんちの爆音の目覚まし時計の音で起床時間より早く起こされるし、寝起きのトイレから戻っても鳴り続けてるし早く起きろバカヤローおはようございます。
711 2018-09-25 22:26:17 Then....just add oil and an egg all that extra shit is unnecessary
712 2018-09-25 22:26:16 @jkenney Hi greetings, thanks for the good work, I need a number to reach you on directly. I am in discussion with Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited to  purchase Canadian  crude oil, pls you mind referring me to a top crude  oil export company willing to assist to export ?
713 2018-09-25 22:26:11 Oil lobby and/or Fox News.
714 2018-09-25 22:26:09 Am I the only one that sniggers well oil of ulay ads mention daily facials 
715 2018-09-25 22:26:08 How about building bitumen refineries in Canada and using our own oil? A lot of Canadians might get behind that idea.
716 2018-09-25 22:25:59 Yes. I also use a drop of oil .. literally a drop + a small pad of butter.
717 2018-09-25 22:25:50 Tout pour le shiling oil !!
718 2018-09-25 22:25:43 Dear @IndraNooyi I heard about Pepsi’s palm oil problem and I really hope that you’ll cut ties with @Indofood in your final week as CEO. I love #orangutans and our #rainforests too. Don’t let them die for cheap #palmoil
719 2018-09-25 22:25:41 I’ll vouch for you on this had to take pictures for something and felt a giant pimple forming on my nose put some tea tree oil on it and it stopped
720 2018-09-25 22:25:39 Depuis que je suis en France, j'ai jamais été aussi heureuse d'utiliser du shiling oil 
721 2018-09-25 22:25:38 @Ritzcrackers you promised to cut your ties to deforestation,YOU HAVENT!You’re one of Wilmar’s top customers & they’re the dirtiest palm oil giant & biggest threat to Indonesia’s rainforests,You are aiding the murder of Orangutans!Keep your promise,cut your ties with Wilmar!
722 2018-09-25 22:25:32  Yeah - it's like that with my art making - I can't take out too much, because the cats want to "help"... by swatting the oil pastels off the table, drinking the water, etc.! 
723 2018-09-25 22:25:29 They are Fox's excuse for advertising fair and balanced news. 
724 2018-09-25 22:25:24 Charles I voted for President Trump & approve of the majority of his actions. However part of the FORGOTTEN AMERICANS are investors in the gutted oil sector. Now if oils up 1$ Trump is quick to respond YET he gives APPLE a PASS on Tariffs? The richest Company in HX???
725 2018-09-25 22:25:23 Gerald, Taxing Carbon is not a National climate plan. Regulating Oil and gas in Alberta and Saskatchewan out of business is not a National Climate plan. 
Providing political exemptions to these debilitating regulations to BC and Quebec in exchange for votes is not a climate plan
726 2018-09-25 22:25:07 A Arena @petrobras é a casa da companhia no Pavilhão 4 da Rio Oil & Gas 2018. Diversas apresentações serão realizadas como a palestra de Vinícius Massa sobre o desenvolvimento de produtos para a Fórmula 1, amanhã (26/09), às 15h.
727 2018-09-25 22:25:02 The #rainforests are our planet’s beating heart & the #orangutans that swing in the trees of #Indonesia are one of its most precious creatures. Don’t let dirty #palmoil destroy this. I’m calling on @PepsiCo’s CEO @IndraNooyi to stop dealing with palm oil villain @Indofood
728 2018-09-25 22:25:00 Vendo as fotos do pessoal na Rio Oil and Gas... Ah mas não pago mais de mil conto em feira. Pago não.
729 2018-09-25 22:24:58 So basically she doesnt want it exposed how shes a snake oil salesman robbing hard working people of their money, so in fear of losing her gravy train she panicked and had to do anything she could think of to not lose her already shot reputation completely. Cool story.
730 2018-09-25 22:24:56 Omg life is great just found my oil pen I was sure was gone for good! #winning
731 2018-09-25 22:24:50 The accusations aimed at Iran describe the current USA regime.
If Iran is 'responsible for the Syrian conflict' it is because without Iran Syria would be a thug-american colony, its oil pipelined to USA thugs, it's people dead or enslaved.
732 2018-09-25 22:24:46 The dude is just practicing with the palm oil, before he graduates to blood.
733 2018-09-25 22:24:32 There is a whole bunch of us who started learning Turkish on Duolingo after starting #ErkenciKuş !  I now know how to drink oil and eat cheese with tomatoes in Türkçe!!

736 2018-09-25 22:24:17 #PalmOil is causing havoc to Indonesian forests & wildlife. @PepsiCo is fuelling this, through business partnership with one of the industry’s worst offenders @Indofood. RT to join me in calling on CEO @IndraNooyi to end Pepsi’s palm oil crimes
737 2018-09-25 22:24:16 Yep
738 2018-09-25 22:24:13 Yes, you are. Those are all oil and gas companies that operate in Colorado. Any money donated is coming from the Colorado BU’s.
739 2018-09-25 22:24:09 At TJs buying wine, chocolate, and olive oil. Yeah I'm a bad bitch
740 2018-09-25 22:24:08 審議拒否！
741 2018-09-25 22:24:04 I will.  But I better stop dreaming about France and focus on Oil Creek.
742 2018-09-25 22:23:56 theres probably never been a better candidate for national district attorney in the history of the position!!
743 2018-09-25 22:23:47 Blamed opec for high oil prices, even threatened them then praised Saudi Arabia. Germans were giggling at his reference of being dependable of RUssia.
744 2018-09-25 22:23:39 #PalmOil is destroying Indonesian forests & wildlife. @PepsiCo's partnership with @Indofood, which cleared 10000 ha of protected rainforest is shameful. RT to call on CEO @IndraNooyi to end Pepsi’s complicity in palm oil crime.
745 2018-09-25 22:23:26 Your Head Haff oil.
Taking position now
746 2018-09-25 22:23:20 Give them a wash with hot water and soap to get the outermost oils off and see if that helps, may not need to be completely stripped. Since they've been unused for a long time the oil from when it was put away probably went rancid
747 2018-09-25 22:23:12 Ponerme las pilas con alguien o seguir mirando babosamente al playero de la oil ????

751 2018-09-25 22:22:16 And my point is he's not the one who yielded them. Lester was their best pitcher and he's literally one ground ball away from a double play out of the inning up 7-4. Their bullpen was leaking oil all September
752 2018-09-25 22:22:12 The United States literally created the current regime in Iran because they didn't want to share oil profits, and now they want to install another puppet government. There was a democracy, the warhawks killed it.
753 2018-09-25 22:22:06 @Ritzcrackers   Stop using dirty palm oil! #dirtypalmoil #Greenpeace
754 2018-09-25 22:22:04 Glowing engine check 
Oil change, low psi, please
Get me where I need
755 2018-09-25 22:21:57 Seems like a box of DARK HISTORY. Or just very, very, very old medicated oil. Haven't seen those boxes in a long time. 
756 2018-09-25 22:21:52 I just bought a cool new Poo-Chi robot dog! ABC’s Lost was a secret documentary! It’s all true! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!

758 2018-09-25 22:21:40 Glazers and Ed aren't going.. what's your solution? That's the top... Jose is expendible but the problems lie deeper. Unless we get some oil money to turn the Glazers head, then this is it.

760 2018-09-25 22:21:24 @RitzCrackers is one of the brands that are still buying dirty palm oil from rainforest destroyers! The first step to stop deforestation is to stop working with companies like Wilmar. #DropDirtyPalmOi

763 2018-09-25 22:21:08 @JohnCornyn @tedcruz Could you two please educate the President on the fact that high oil prices are good for Texas – bij SWAT: South West Alief Texas

770 2018-09-25 22:20:28 Pepsi profits from dirty palm oil. Unless CEO @IndraNooyi takes responsibility and ends @PepsiCo’s business deal with #palmoil offender @Indofood, Pepsi will continue to prop up the destruction of Indonesia’s #rainforests and #orangutans
771 2018-09-25 22:20:26 Please get out of the dirty palm oil business.  This is long overdue
772 2018-09-25 22:20:25 Therefore you can tailor your arguments to persuade people depending on whether you think they're more likely to be receptive to the 'We need to be more self-reliant; not rely on handouts' line or the 'WM takes all our revenue and oil and gives us back pocket money' line.
773 2018-09-25 22:20:23 Take the Oil Out!!! Will it be deflation caused by oil prices, will it be deflation caused by higher interest rates, or will it be deflation caused by growth???
774 2018-09-25 22:20:23 Pepsi has a palm oil problem & its CEO @IndraNooyi has one week left at the helm, it’s time for her to end @PepsiCo’s deals with scandal-mired #palmoil business partner @Indofood

779 2018-09-25 22:19:43 Oil is not a guarantee to eradicate poverty; Nigeria, Venezuela  are examples.  Having oil offers some chances but no guarantee! Chances if you play with their plan otherwise Iraq, Libya are examples to learn from!
780 2018-09-25 22:19:41 You do oil changes though right?
781 2018-09-25 22:19:39 Saudi Arabia is ran by one family the country is literally named after the al saad family as long as the royals do as they are told buy weapons off Uncle Sam and sell their oil they are basically lap dogs to other powers
782 2018-09-25 22:19:39 cbd oil is truly magical. i didn't believe in it at first but i have just spent the last two hours with my parents and i am treating them kindly???? responding with enthusiasm???? floating through the kitchen????
783 2018-09-25 22:19:30 Burning the midnight oil?
784 2018-09-25 22:19:29 I agree up to a point: her coalition in Alaska expects her to be moderate. Her base comprises libertarian Rs, moderate Ds, green energy voters (she's for oil, but she's pretty good on alt. energy too), and Alaska Natives. Keeping all those happy requires moderation.
785 2018-09-25 22:19:20 Be careful. The oil can affect the magnetic strip.
786 2018-09-25 22:19:09 Smell snake oil
787 2018-09-25 22:19:01 @Stephen25719292 After the EU, at the UNGA meetings opted to support the barbaric regime of Iran, in rejection of the oppressed, terrorised, Iranian Peoples Pleas! for trade, greed, oil, at the costs of human rights, knowing the terrorist activities of Iran in Europe this summer

790 2018-09-25 22:18:48 Maybe these protesters will get locked up and not let go bringing a smile to all of the oil field workers that they like to protest against in Canada
791 2018-09-25 22:18:42 This summer I was following a story about human remains found in Miller County. Yesterday, a man was arrested in connection to the homicide - I dove into court documents today that say the victim and suspect were dealing marijuana oil. @KOMUnews
792 2018-09-25 22:18:34 Another coincidence Mr. Junker (president of the EU) "suggested" to use the EURO instead of the US dollar to settle oil transactions.

807 2018-09-25 22:16:37 Agree with Shelley, we had Gerbils same thing all night long. We ended up putting corn oil on the wheel so it wouldn’t squeak
808 2018-09-25 22:16:35 When the evil despair, we are heartened.
809 2018-09-25 22:16:35 Nawrp that's actually the stench of extracted oil from Syria from their rockets after retaliating to Israel's planes.
810 2018-09-25 22:16:35 I bought $20 olive oil bc it was on sale for $8 and WOW it’s so good, I can’t wait to be rich so I can stop skimping out on better ingredients yanno

816 2018-09-25 22:15:07 USAs biggest employer is the military the usa is trying to sustain its biggest employer. Saudi russia will not drop the price of oil, dollar will have issues. The world is now beginning to see that usa needs war to maintain its economy. The usa is a terrorist for financial gain.
817 2018-09-25 22:15:02 I bought oil , put oil in the truck pumped gas added water to the truck, checked my tire pressure and added air . Did a Starbucks run for 6 people and bought lunch with 30 mins left of my hour break .
818 2018-09-25 22:15:01 It's @PepsiCo CEO @IndraNooyi's final week, but she still hasn't fixed Pepsi's #palmoil problem. I want her to save the #orangutans and leave a legacy free from #rainforest #deforestation & #workerabuse - by dropping palm oil villain @Indofood now!
819 2018-09-25 22:14:58 Hibs shares rise on higher oil; dollar slips as policy tightening eyed

824 2018-09-25 22:14:28 Humans are already going backwards, holding onto a very outdated source of power, problem is the powers at be get $ from them and jobs after they retire or get ousted! Backward countries like China need it, but advanced countries in Europe are divesting themselves off oil!

828 2018-09-25 22:14:01 When your oil change and inspection/registration fall on the same day 
829 2018-09-25 22:13:59 After today’s abject performance. Price of oil is at a multi year high and yet the share price is a multi year low.
830 2018-09-25 22:13:55 AKA Thousands in Colorado will lose jobs as I Gut the gas and oil industry in Colorado. I will impose new taxes for those of you driving older cars, and we will all have electric ones by 2040. I'll also be raising taxes to fund Medicaid for all even tho you voted against it.
831 2018-09-25 22:13:44 But on Iraq, and on Iran, the Israeli govt says what Trump & the US oil industry wants it to say.  It really is all about the oil.
832 2018-09-25 22:13:43 Everyone wants to hear about the exciting parts of transition, like growing a beard and voice breaking but not a one of you wants to hear about my testosterone sweats, itchy skin and major political parties trying to invade my back for my bountiful oil
833 2018-09-25 22:13:31 #Trump says more sanctions will follow after resumption of oil sanctions on Iran on Nov. 5

834 2018-09-25 22:13:29 It's @PepsiCo CEO @IndraNooyi's final week, but she still hasn't fixed Pepsi's #palmoil problem. I want her to save the #orangutans and leave a legacy free from #rainforest #deforestation & #workerabuse - by dropping palm oil villain @Indofood now!

841 2018-09-25 22:12:36 Garlic butter instead of oil
842 2018-09-25 22:12:26 Yeah. We eat them with a tomato bases sauce with fish. Or if we're lazy we'd just eat them with palm oil.
843 2018-09-25 22:12:26 I had no idea who "Lil Xan" was until I saw "Hot Cheetos" trending. I know I'm not alone in this. I love those Hot Cheetos BTW, never "overdosed" on them. Did he eat them with Wasabi Oil or what? 
844 2018-09-25 22:12:26 Got spiced sandalwood beard oil and boy oh boy does it smell great
845 2018-09-25 22:12:25 Rosehip oil and vitamin e oil have worked well for me in terms of brightening my skin. Also Avene Triacneal has helped fade my dark marks. You can get it from Superdrug and boots x
846 2018-09-25 22:12:20 Which allies are those? The ones who want to get rich off of Iranian oil and sell arms to them. Allies like that we don’t need. Iran is the worlds largest sponsor of terrorism, to a great part funded by the deal you support. Lady, wake up!

849 2018-09-25 22:11:20 Hi! Is Jupiter oil a typo and she uses juniper oil? I like the idea but I definitely haven’t found any Jupiter oils :) but maybe I’m looking in all the wrong plac s? Thanks! Thanks!
850 2018-09-25 22:11:17 Seeing something similar here with a proposition for stricter rules on land development in regard to fishery preservation and such.

All the ads against it have "paid for by oil X" in the fast-speak legal disclaimers.
851 2018-09-25 22:11:01 @RitzCrackers is one of the brands that are still buying dirty palm oil from rainforest destroyers! The first step to stop deforestation is to stop working with companies like Wilmar. #DropDirtyPalmOi
852 2018-09-25 22:10:37 $90 oil coming. Fuel inflation +14% already y/h. Is any one home in climate action & energy to say 'acclerate renewables pipeline of 4bn and EV's' or we ok to have homes & businesses disposal hit on two sides; oil inflation AND EU 2020 fine of 700-1bn fine a year (€700 per home)
853 2018-09-25 22:10:29 That’s the point . Stop turning them to oil wells

855 2018-09-25 22:10:12 Next time someone tells you that the all the US wants from Venezuela is oil tell them: YES!!!, AND WE WANT TO SELL IT TO THEM. That is the only freaking thing we sell in the international market and the US is the closest, easiest market for it.

857 2018-09-25 22:10:08 Our allies and European businesses are abandoning Iran. Their economy is failing. Their oil sales are down. They are trying to support terrorism with an ever shrinking budget. Stick to lying about Ford, when it comes to anything else you are grotesquely ignorant.

863 2018-09-25 22:09:41 Why not do your own service like a real MoPar chick? I’ve got an empty garage if the kitty needs an oil check and change. 
864 2018-09-25 22:09:39 Talk, talk, talk.  I want to see action.  Blockade their ports so their oil can't be exported, make it a crime for U.S. companies to do business with Iran, make it illegal for US residents to travel to Iran, and launch military strikes against their nuclear facilities.
865 2018-09-25 22:09:38 it should be fine to clean it and reseason it from the beginning (ideally with unsaturated oil like canola this time).

It's a shame to lose your grandma's seasoning, but a lot of the benefit from an old cast iron is older build quality and the wear of regular use over the years

875 2018-09-25 22:08:43 So glad I spoke to a kind hearted man at the dealership that wasn’t trying to just get me to buy a car. Lol as bad as I want a Jaguar (since I was like 10) I will not be paying $200 for oil changes. That’s ridiculous

879 2018-09-25 22:08:05 Thank you! This is great! So many recipes and so many different yummy vegetables and fruits. One thing I would change though is the oil. It’s an ingredient in almost each recipe. Oil is not a health food. I’d avoid it as much as possible.

882 2018-09-25 22:07:38 I'd be ok with that, within certain income parameters  We need to distinguish between tiny congregations where they pass the plate to afford heating oil in winter from gigantic corporate churches with multiple real estate holdings, a large paid staff and an advertising budget.

936 2018-09-25 22:00:36 I'm sure you're aware since you're very knowledgeable but I wanted to add since critters are mentioned that tea tree oil can be deadly for cats. Cats can also be very sensitive to other oils and each need to be researched.

956 2018-09-25 21:58:09 Iranian regime lied about independence from great powers. 40 years after revolution their economy is more than ever dependent on oil and dollars. They only brought misery and war and poverty to Iranians. #IraniansWantRegimeChange

961 2018-09-25 21:57:28 Win Nov canola up A$1.75/t & EU rape up A$8.85. Canola taking its lead from lift in US soybns which in turn followed Chinese soy prices higher. EU rape likely to be factoring in drop in Aust crop as well. Support from recent gains in crude oil.

965 2018-09-25 21:56:58 I just got black seed oil, my credit score better improve
966 2018-09-25 21:56:52 Firstly you have to transport oil both to refineries and then petrol goes in huge deisel trucks have to carry it daily to forecourts. Whereas Electrical power goes direct almost instantly from where it is made down wire and into the car. (Point 1!)
967 2018-09-25 21:56:46 Yes, to your immaculate classic Cadillac

No, to the old Rolls, burning oil
968 2018-09-25 21:56:39 I be trying not to wash my hair so much. I be waiting for like a wk & half...at least 2wks before I wash my hair. Ik it grows more when I leave it alone. Oil it, leave in conditioner it & leave it alone.

970 2018-09-25 21:56:34 What do you mean by "test"? what does he have in mind invading Venezuela and taking their oil?
971 2018-09-25 21:56:25 Just started using Canola Oil for my hair and I love it already!!!! Just because it’s like I got perfume all over my hair!!! Smells soooooo good!!! 
972 2018-09-25 21:56:09 What?! @PepsiCo STILL profits from exploitation #palmoil? Tell CEO @IndraNooyi to end her deals with palm oil villains @Indofood now
973 2018-09-25 21:56:02 Paps has accused Australia of trying to get in on the Israeli oil & gas deal with Cyprus. See the thing is, Israeli & Cypriot oil & gas looks like it's going to run through a hub in Turkey, joining up with a Russian pipeline. Just what were you up to @GeorgePapa19 ? @thespybrief
974 2018-09-25 21:56:00 Odaaro, in the name of the soap, lotion and oil.
975 2018-09-25 21:55:57 As for the power, oil and gas. If the EU are getting it from Russia, how many sources are there? You thinking a pipeline from the US? Ireland would love that stepping over them. 2/2

978 2018-09-25 21:55:25 Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off buildings. Obstructing Transmountain = enriching #LGBTQ killing dictators.

980 2018-09-25 21:55:22 OPEC will not listen to you Mr.President,,,most of those countries need the revenues from their gas and oil to finance their governments and projects!

1008 2018-09-25 21:51:54 We have no serious military bases there. We can not travel there without a special visa. We are not welcomed in their mosques. Many of their 2,000 princes fund terrorism. We are not friends. We are just comfortable with each other. Very soon we will not be buying their oil.
1009 2018-09-25 21:51:46 I always get discounts on my oil changes 
1010 2018-09-25 21:51:34 Yeah, I pick most of my ribbons up on Ebay. This was one I've had lying around for a while. I'm actually vegetarian so the whole 'whale oil' thing is a little discombobulating to be honest. I'm glad I've only the one :). Thanks for the info though, and the kind offer.

1013 2018-09-25 21:51:13 Not to be a "have you tried...." But. I started using a magnesium oil spray. I'd already been taking mag supplements, which do kinda help me sleep, and shut up my restless legs a little bit. But the mag oil applied topically takes that zip zap crap down a few notches, every time.

1015 2018-09-25 21:50:55 @ChickfilA hey yo, I just called and asked what kind of oil you use and your manager said “canola” and when I asked if you use anything else she said “no” and I looked on the website and it clearly says you use peanut oil.... AND I WAS CALLING BC OF A ALLERGY TO PEANUT OIL

1021 2018-09-25 21:50:33 Going to crash when EVERYTHING get more expensive thanks to you . Even oil is going up
1022 2018-09-25 21:50:31 We live in an authoritarian country also, it has nothing to do with leadership style.  It seems our leaders, the energy companies, want all that oil.
1023 2018-09-25 21:50:24 It is easy to resort to stereotypes, easy to forget the last 40 years of Venezuelan history, easy to forget that the ones who built refineries and bought distribution chains in the US was Venezuela, easy to forget how oil markets actually work. Slogans are easier.

1032 2018-09-25 21:49:50 Oil prices rose 0.8% to $81.87 a barrel. OPEC lack of specific plans to raise production as President Trump call to increase output and cap prices

1041 2018-09-25 21:48:36 Good points! I figure oil markets will wait to see the barrels, which means that the oil companies or shipping companies will need to trust it, and a lot more detail needed for that on the SPV and on what the U.S. means by significant reductions
1042 2018-09-25 21:48:26 When you go for an oil change and the mechanic asks how the hell did your car pass inspection?  *sighs*

1056 2018-09-25 21:46:07 We are exposing those pictures because UN is aware of the killing, instead of doing the right thing they appoint the same linage that kill for them to steal mineral resources.

1067 2018-09-25 21:45:09 Still haven't figured out why putting on makeup makes me MORE oily.

Same skin care (cleanse, tone, serum, moisturizer). Usu ? Results in clearish skin all day.

But forehead and cheeks become an oil slick w makeup up.

@HeyAprill @jackieaina I trust you two. Any thoughts?

1071 2018-09-25 21:44:50 My point was that you can't change your whole belief system on one speculative thing. I've been bit by a dog but I have three of them. Like it or not this entire planet operates around money. Every decision by every government is decided upon by economics. Oil is big money.
1072 2018-09-25 21:44:47 The day I can walk into a Krispy Kreme without reeking of grease is the day I'll prefer those oil bombs over a classic Dunkin strawberry frosted sprinkle donut.

1077 2018-09-25 21:43:48 Just wait until your tariffs start to hit the consumers! Oil prices will spike even more due to your other policies. What ever happened to your promise to balance the budget? And why hasn't Mexico paid for that wall which will never get built?

1084 2018-09-25 21:43:24 In other words people can follow the guidelines and still cook absolutely nothing from scratch themselves. People can also deep fry their vegetables in sunflower oil, if they want, even if they are battered, & still follow guidelines.

1086 2018-09-25 21:43:12 Really need some CBD Oil! Anyone wanna help out and get some videos!? :)
1087 2018-09-25 21:43:07 Bizarrely, some voters will actually believe this nonsense! Typically you read about the same voters sending money to help a stranger,  whom sadly, is unable to get off their oil rig and collect the 10 million left to them in a Nigerian bank account! Etc etc......
1088 2018-09-25 21:43:06 Finally clean my car then ol boy blows his engine in front of me on the highway and now my car is absolutely coated in engine oil

1090 2018-09-25 21:42:59 It's @PepsiCo CEO @IndraNooyi's final week, but she still hasn't fixed Pepsi's #palmoil problem. I want her to save the #orangutans and leave a legacy free from #rainforest #deforestation & #workerabuse - by dropping palm oil villain @Indofood now!
1091 2018-09-25 21:42:56 Yeah we know you want to control their oil
1092 2018-09-25 21:42:28 It's @PepsiCo CEO @IndraNooyi's final week, but she still hasn't fixed Pepsi's #palmoil problem. I want her to save the #orangutans and leave a legacy free from #rainforest #deforestation & #workerabuse - by dropping palm oil villain @Indofood now!
1093 2018-09-25 21:42:24 How about we work towards a non oil fuel economy. Kill two birds with one stone. Reduce the effects of climate change and put the Middle East back in it's box?
1094 2018-09-25 21:42:18 @CNN Stop playing the Barker at "The Circus"
Give me some news I can watch. If I wanted to go to the circus I would buy a ticket. Here is something you can work on. Zinke & Trump selling $ leasing the Gulf of Mexico to oil& gas March 2019...Do your job!
Who.what.when.where?
1095 2018-09-25 21:42:04 I dunno Pal, maybe by not buying oil with our money with the intension of selling it to China so they can light it on fire. Did you discuss that possibility?
1096 2018-09-25 21:42:03 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
1097 2018-09-25 21:42:03 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1098 2018-09-25 21:42:01 No. But I partake in THC.  Should I try the oil?

1107 2018-09-25 21:40:44 @BreeAnnB893 heyyyy Bree! I am wondering how you get your hair so long and beautiful? I color my hair jet black, i do coconut oil mask on my hair every week. I take folic acid as well. Im trying to grow out my layers. What type of shampoo and conditioner do you use dor dark hair?
1108 2018-09-25 21:40:36 You talk about a back alley snake oil salesman! Your a current senator and you still don’t want to admit that this has never been in the hands of the FBI. #EffinJackass
1109 2018-09-25 21:40:31 He wants that already, and already has opened most of them to oil and gas exploitation.
1110 2018-09-25 21:40:30 Parabéns por manterem viva a chama da Rio Oil & Gas, mesmo que, por causa de fatores mais do que conhecidos, não seja tão grandiosa como outrora. Ainda é muito relevante e movimenta negócios vitais para o Brasil.
1111 2018-09-25 21:40:28 Remember the 70's gas / oil problems? It started then .
He knows the players.

The proof would be cost to demand issues. They set that also. Opec controlling prices and output gives them a lot of power.

1113 2018-09-25 21:40:26 No, I don't see how this can continue. There are only so many billionaires in the world, and some of these purchases will possibly never make it to the race track. As long as oil prices remain high and tax breaks for the super wealthy remain, there will be those willing to invest
1114 2018-09-25 21:40:09 サラダ油に流されて変わってゆく私をあなたは時々遠くで叱って。

1128 2018-09-25 21:38:30 Food for thought during lunch at #USAEE18DC from @richardgnewell: we have actually *never* gone through an energy transition; consumption of every fuel category (except whale oil) has grown over time.
1129 2018-09-25 21:38:29 Common ground with screaming violent lunatic Marxist leftists? 
Cant imagine what that would be.

1131 2018-09-25 21:38:05 Pepsi profits from dirty palm oil. Unless CEO @IndraNooyi takes responsibility and ends @PepsiCo’s business deal with #palmoil offender @Indofood, Pepsi will continue to prop up the destruction of Indonesia’s #rainforests and #orangutans
1132 2018-09-25 21:37:36 and now Cruz is no longer a snake oil salesman? Do they know anything about Beto O’Rourke? He called out the hecklers
1133 2018-09-25 21:37:27 • war on drugs is a waste of money 
• invest in green energy
• lower ur energy costs/consumption
• oil/coal are bad for the environment
• build your own refineries = more jobs
1134 2018-09-25 21:37:25 13)  Reminder: Only about 50% of oil production goes to fuel. The rest goes to synthetics that every modern person in a developed society uses every day. 

The easiest enemy happens to be the least of the problem...

1157 2018-09-25 21:34:38 I agree. I hate when arguments are oversimplified or politicized. We need to get oil overseas so find a real solution. Do it right and do it well with the best information and technology available so we don’t damage one segment of the economy to support another.

1167 2018-09-25 21:34:02 No one told me Castor oil was this good for hair. Look at my hairline making a come back. Should have been on this shit since I was like 6.
1168 2018-09-25 21:33:52 Maybe they oughta start selling CBD oil.
1169 2018-09-25 21:33:49 The govt (lab) hold the 10% in a fund and issues  the shares that cant be sold. Max £500.
Shell oil 10% dividend =£1.2B. 80,000 employees x £500 = £40M. £1.2B - £1.16B.
The govt keeps £1.16B whilst patronising the workers into thinking they are valued.
It’s called robbery.

1175 2018-09-25 21:33:27 yea the oil is great! I also got the beard wash and it does seem to be better than normal shampoo. Nice scent, too. Reminiscent of good old rugged Irish Spring
1176 2018-09-25 21:33:20 So I went and got my oil changed. And of course they show you what all else is wrong with the car. Like do you want to get this done. It will be over $300. I'm like nope still just want the oil change. It drove just fine coming in here. So it should drive the same going out haha.
1177 2018-09-25 21:33:14 This man stoped oil production for days the world's almost stopped also from that. He says 'we were living without oil and we can do it again' especially for those how were living in desert it will be much easier now from back then.
1178 2018-09-25 21:33:05 Trudeau Jr. talked about clean green dirty oil sands!

1183 2018-09-25 21:32:13 No one is ripping anyone off you moron , you restricted the flow of  Iranian oil by imposing illegal embargo that led to reduced supply and increased demand hence the increase in prices ! #UN #iran
1184 2018-09-25 21:32:12 Beard shampoo and beard oil. Make sure you dry it 100% before putting on the beard oil and don't put on too much. Just a few drops between your palms, rub them together, then rub them on your beard. If it's not fully dry it can get sore and flaky

1191 2018-09-25 21:31:44 @Ritzcrackers Every 25 seconds a football pitch of forest is lost in Indonesia and Indigenous People, orangutans and the climate are losing out. This is mostly because huge areas of forest are cleared to plant palm trees that produce palm oil. Promise no deforestation palm oil!
1192 2018-09-25 21:31:36 That’s exactly what priesthood blessings with consecrated oil is.
1193 2018-09-25 21:31:34 At the moment I have three heating oil tanks in the garden and am waiting for them to start removing the outside wall were the oil leaked into it 
1194 2018-09-25 21:31:31 The great battle against US hegemony as global superpower is now! Not in the medium or long term. All the actions are staring us in the face. Gold accumulation, pricing oil in Yuan, bilateral trade in local currency and now Europe's intention to use an SPV. 
Pick your side....
1195 2018-09-25 21:31:05 At the U.N. wrong again Donald brought up selling coal and oil to other countries and asked what kind of world will we leave for our children.If its up to him it will be a world of increasing damage to the environment.
1196 2018-09-25 21:31:05 Niceeee, i work at an indigenous oil servicing firm and we do majorly marine logistics... so i know about nipex (we are registered there). Sad part is when you suffer to package bid and submit and your company doesn't win.

1212 2018-09-25 21:30:06 Oversimplifying for twitter because its waaayyy more to it but the crux of all economic issues stems from the mandated choice of crude Oil being the main resource and currency that America recognizes. Any changes to oil prices and we see them reflected in our local economy.

1219 2018-09-25 21:29:41 John Bolton is a warmongering bitch. Iran was just attacked, not the US. One critical thing. If Iran is attacked, they might not win a conventional war with the US, but they can and will inflict a lot of damage, especially to the US economy starting with taking out Saudi oil.

1221 2018-09-25 21:29:19 Particularly bothered at Dickson and Okorocha. Bayelsa and Imo are oil revenue states. Pray, what is their excuse for not paying salaries and collecting their own entitlements at the end of each month and stealing at the end of their tenure and salaries till they die?
1222 2018-09-25 21:29:09 19th Senate district just voted in an R. 
A Hispanic district changing direction for a socialist is not likely. This area is heavily dependent on energy sector for jobs, not very climate hoax friendly.

1224 2018-09-25 21:28:53 No. No it isn’t. I believe in what is at worst trolling to prove a point. You believe in enchanted olive oil. That’s not even remotely the same kind of disconnect with reality.
1225 2018-09-25 21:28:23 Pepsi has a palm oil problem & its CEO @IndraNooyi has one week left at the helm, it’s time for her to end @PepsiCo’s deals with scandal-mired #palmoil business partner @Indofood
1226 2018-09-25 21:28:19 When we stop allowing oil companies to influence our politics with unlimited amounts of money.
1227 2018-09-25 21:28:12 @dove why are you using Wilmar as your source of palm oil??

1240 2018-09-25 21:27:17 I love the cast.  Could it be because it’s Dallas?  Lived in Houston for many years and people seem to think Texans are mainly rednecks riding their horses to work.  They picture tumbleweed, and oil rigs.  Maybe because it’s not NY, OC, etc?? It really makes no sense.
1241 2018-09-25 21:27:15 @RitzCrackers is one of the brands that are still buying dirty palm oil from rainforest destroyers! The first step to stop deforestation is to stop working with companies like Wilmar. #DropDirtyPalmOi

1244 2018-09-25 21:26:56 Mix one part lemon juice and two parts of coconut or olive oil.
Apply it on your hair and scalp and leave it on for 30 to 45 minutes.
Wash it out and then shampoo your hair with a mild shampoo.
Repeat once or twice a week

1278 2018-09-25 21:23:19 If you're sending your wife/GF to get something from the hardware store, can you at the very least explain wtf it is that she's getting? Today:
"Do you have castor oil?"
"I'm not sure, what's that for?"
"I don't know."
Seriously.

1288 2018-09-25 21:22:23 My experience getting an oil change: 1. drove around the lot for 15 minutes because I didn’t know where to go. 2. Guy felt bad so he let me cut in front of everyone in line and gave me a free tire rotation. 3. I cleaned up their waiting room because I got bored
1289 2018-09-25 21:22:22 Didn’t do sh** all for me. I was recently laid off after 25 years in oil and gas, as were many of my female colleagues.

1294 2018-09-25 21:21:55 Dude, you are going to lose this one. You believe that the Native Americans are Jews and that you can heal people’s ailments with olive oil that has been prayed over. Hold back on (blanketly) suggesting apostates are mentally ill.
1295 2018-09-25 21:21:51 Fuck that, pour flaming oil down on them!

1302 2018-09-25 21:21:07 Lavender or tea tree oil and certain supplements such as Dong Quai and Tribulus terrestris have also been associated with gynecomastia.

1304 2018-09-25 21:20:53 I cooked the pork then used the juices from the pork, olive oil, salt, pepper, crushed red pepper flakes, garlic, and butter to cook the kale. I didn’t think it was anything special but he was upset there was no more today.

1306 2018-09-25 21:20:41 Betty Crocker cake mix might be a good idea. Add water, oil and an egg and whack it in the oven. Available in Asda, Tesco, etc, but apparently also in places like B&M or Home Bargains, if you've got those locally.
1307 2018-09-25 21:20:35 $CEI Oil is spiking & it’s over $72 the highest in 4 years and no debt and all time low prices so what are you worry about. Buy and hold $$$
1308 2018-09-25 21:20:31 In practice this tends to happen at times of crisis, and is a result of power relations on the ground, and the ideas in the air at the time.

The major US inflection points recently are "great depression" and "70s oil/stagflation crisis"

This posture is not for national defense, but for protecting the Saudi oil fields and keeping the American military industrial complex humming along with new orders.
1320 2018-09-25 21:19:27 That's fine and I can understand that. Personally I enjoyed the game on the whole as I felt there are a lot of good scenes and missions, Lara and Jonah's campfire talk, the day of the dead festival and the oil refinery mission are all, IMHO, great bits.

If he wants US to have energy independence, what does it matter? We'll be insulated from rising prices.

1338 2018-09-25 21:17:18 Thank God for president Trump. He finally said what we all have been thinking. That the nation's we protect and risk lives for need to stop making oil prices so high in return for our protection. Trump is truly making America great again #makingAmericagreat

I question the sincerity. #NoOnBBB

1354 2018-09-25 21:16:11 Why does the price of oil go up?
1355 2018-09-25 21:16:07 Midnight Oil - "Beds are burning"
1356 2018-09-25 21:15:53 So does olive oil
1357 2018-09-25 21:15:53 I’m not defending Russia, which is a danger not only 2 US but 2 entire world, but Trump putting down Germany 4 buying Russia oil is laughable since US buys significant oil from & sells missiles 2 Saudi Arabia where most of the 9/11 terrorists were from, plus he idolizes Putin.
1358 2018-09-25 21:15:49 Let CA get more in debt.  How’s Gov Brown’s oil business doing? @KamalaHarris hard for you to know healthcare since you aren’t on ACA by choice and have a lifetime pension on tax payers dime.  How about you fork some of the money over.
1359 2018-09-25 21:15:44 Just trying to have a nice relaxing bath cause I’m not well, added a few drops of essential oil cause that’s the kind of wanker I am, and now I’m having some sort of allergic reaction. I’m going to hibernate till Christmas, see ya.
1360 2018-09-25 21:15:44 @mshainee dude. Before you leave, do keep some documents about your oil expedition thing okay. At least their email addresses. Am trying find it again. This time near Addu area. Btw we r cool right?
1361 2018-09-25 21:15:40 Our dog recommends salmon oil rather than cod liver oil, which is high in vitamin A (too much not good).

1366 2018-09-25 21:15:26 Midnight Oil
1367 2018-09-25 21:15:26 Agreed. Though quite a lot's happened there already...

Not a fan of most of Trump's policies--and I doubt he'll do anything about OPEC, as evidenced by the steady rise of oil and the semi-panicky noises about the SPR--but this is one of many problems he inherited, not caused.

1370 2018-09-25 21:14:35 I discovered using sesame oil a while back and it's a game changer. I've made lots of dishes with it and even if you use the same spices etc, it still tastes sooo different!

1372 2018-09-25 21:14:29 You HAVE to try roasted sprouts. Honestly, a game changer. Cut in 2, bit of olive oil, season, oven til crisp. Delicious, HONESTLY.  Good luck!
1373 2018-09-25 21:14:22 If only the world was laughing. See European efforts to avoid Iran sanctions in oil trading. Costly, but if effective, dollar dominance will be seriously shaken. All because the Orange Bully is MAGA by undermining U.S. credibility.

1385 2018-09-25 21:13:23 No, If Venezuela didn't have oil usa wouldn't try to fake care about their ppl considering they block them from prospering solely because Venezuela doesn't want them interfering with their politics. We have enough problems stateside to b dealing w other countries

1398 2018-09-25 21:12:23 Speculation as to where oil and gas come from.  Sure there is. That’s why they are called fossil fuels. Let me guess you think space god put it there for us.
1399 2018-09-25 21:12:22 I never said it was technical. With a president of the US that thinks climate change is a Chinese hoax do you think it's going to happen any time soon?

Canada makes a big profit off its oil sands.

It's all about money and politics.

1410 2018-09-25 21:10:57 The US $ is being put under greater pressure by the day with their unworkable sanctions and trying to manipulate the oil markets to screw Iran. With both US and Saudi talking to the Bear to take up the slack to punish Iran sort of sounds as though their production is failing. :-)
1411 2018-09-25 21:10:47 So apparently, the secret to have your noodles to taste like chow mein from the takeaway shop is to use sesame oil. 

I've been disappointing myself for 10 years and it's because I've been using olive oil.

1422 2018-09-25 21:09:20 sunday riley!!! the ufo oil and good genes are my favorites
1423 2018-09-25 21:09:17 Investment in #fossilfuel companies mean polluting air, water & land, displacing entire communities, and sometimes fueling violent conflict. But Trump just promoted more exports of 'abundant oil' at #UNGA. Good news is #youth will sue him next month over #climatechange! 
1424 2018-09-25 21:08:48 lol she might get grilled ion the deal but I know when I worked there people would ask a lot about the oil
1425 2018-09-25 21:08:46 Why they get away with these kangaroo courts in universities. Same absurd theory.
1426 2018-09-25 21:08:45 Classic Trudeau - wants to please everyone but ends up fumbling the ball and letting everybody down. His critics and supporters. All while the US secures crude contracts abroad. With world oil consumption approaching 100MBbls/d Canadians are forfeiting economic prosperity.

1431 2018-09-25 21:08:21 Maybe US actually wants Iran taking out those targets. That would make the US the dominant energy supplier along with Russia! the Oil will reach $500 and European economies will collaps too. Good for US and Russia.

1439 2018-09-25 21:07:34 If only Republicans had had the sense to react similarly at the 2016 convention when the trump buffoon actually said out loud to the multitudes:  "I am the only one who can fix this..." The most hilarious line of the convention, but no one laughed. Alas, snake oil kool aid dulls.
1440 2018-09-25 21:07:21 Put some clove oil on it. It will numb it for a while and at least give you some temporary relief.
1441 2018-09-25 21:07:05 I love giving my car oil changes, car washes, new tires, etc. She's my baby. 
1442 2018-09-25 21:07:03 Oh I agree. I wouldn’t want to watch how my meat was killed! But equally I don’t really want to watch how the oil for my car is made, or how the circuit boards on my iPhone are out together. There’s always a level of ignorance in a lot of things we do... but

1446 2018-09-25 21:06:30 @UN Independence and self-determination. For the US that is. Not for OPEC-countries (high oil prices), not for Germany (buying Russian gas), not for North Korea (still nuclearized), not for Venezuela (socialists), not for the rest of the world and certainly not for Iran.

1453 2018-09-25 21:05:54 @RitzCrackers is one of the brands that are still buying dirty palm oil from rainforest destroyers! The first step to stop deforestation is to stop working with companies like Wilmar. #DropDirtyPalmOi
1454 2018-09-25 21:05:41 Gotta love this! Crude oil!
1455 2018-09-25 21:05:40 Same question, but for the Oil Industry.

1459 2018-09-25 21:05:30 I mean. Really?  Let’s destroy camals so we can fry a bit of bacon in a trendy oil. Surely there are food regulations that should stop this?

1461 2018-09-25 21:05:20 Perhaps a better analogy:
You're an oil driller and you'd like to use 3 different refineries. If each won't share its interfaces and schedules to the pipelines that go from your area and would rather you ship crude by railcar, it's difficult to have a multi-refinery operation.
1462 2018-09-25 21:05:18 I'd love to do that! Alas, first we have responsibility to make sure the @GOP doesn't steal ALL the land for an oil pipeline & poison anything living from sea to shine sea or whatever nefarious purpose they WILL devise.

1467 2018-09-25 21:04:52 The United States buys uranium from Russia and gets most of its oil from Canada and other nations. Someone might want to let Trump in on these facts.

1472 2018-09-25 21:04:37 Well, I would’ve voted Democrat these midterms but I died when net neutrality being revoked caused Kim Jung Un to climate change nuke the polar bears into migrating south and Republicans canceled my bear wound coverage under Obamacare for the oil profits.

1476 2018-09-25 21:04:33 @albertaoilsands Alberta Environment, through relevant legislation and guidelines, regulates the impact of oil sands development on air, land, and water in the province.

1492 2018-09-25 21:03:18 Central banks printing fiat would consistently fail (to hit inflation target of 2%) if an oil rich dictator was able to set the price of oil at a rate which would cripple western economies. Fiat would become worthless regardless of government force or widepread public adoption.

1503 2018-09-25 21:02:18 Try halting your own exports of crude oil and refined products (cite national/energy security reasons) and your inventories will rise again. That should do the trick.
1504 2018-09-25 21:02:18 @marksandspencer ditch the palm oil from your biscuits. You're better than that.
1505 2018-09-25 21:02:15 No it wasn’t the liberals that shut that down it was the Quebec gov. And tanker traffic is a reality if we want to get oil overseas but we can manage it in a responsible way. Out east we have designated channels and there are certain time when they close those channels.

1509 2018-09-25 21:02:04 It's the same test as #Horsehill 1 well in 2016.

Which produced just under 2000 barrels of oil sent to Fawley. So I would expect at least that . And considering HH1 was a vertical well and #Balcombe horizonal may be 3 to 5 times more. And no I'm not drunk but could be tempted .

1549 2018-09-25 20:58:23 @joshcheetham utterly irresponsible to write what is basically an advert for a sham. Goop is snake oil. Call it what it is. You have BBC lawyers to protect you so why the puff piece? @DrJenGunter
1550 2018-09-25 20:58:13 My lil baby almost winter ready. New tires and a oil change then im ready for the world.
1551 2018-09-25 20:58:10 But olive oil has a very low smoke point, so it cannot be used it for cooking.  How about avocado oil?
1552 2018-09-25 20:58:08 OK, but presumably your lack of faith in the media started with the previous govt, when Key's shoulder tapping of Fletcher, lying about texts to whale oil, and failing to disclose shares in Air NZ barely rated a mention?

1602 2018-09-25 20:53:34 How does an oil change take this long????
1603 2018-09-25 20:53:32 As long as it flows and they give us an idea of potential. I wouldn’t care if vonks pissed in it. We will have to see, what I do know is that if Balcombe flows and Brockham flows and we know HH does. Then that’s a potential 20 mile oil field for starters.

1623 2018-09-25 20:51:04 I’m not sure why coconut oil ever took off as a “health food”.... if you look at coconut oil in its natural state, it’s very thick and hard. It’s only oily when heated. This is proof that it’s chemistry is comprised of saturated fats.
1624 2018-09-25 20:51:04 We’re not talking about the Saudi’s and their blood oil. The tweet and comment were about the war on drugs. God, you type of users are the worst thing about this free app.

1746 2018-09-25 20:42:44 Olive oil
1747 2018-09-25 20:42:38 Yes but the trouble I have with Vonk is you have to read between the lines. 2990 barrels of what. Water ? Waste oil? No I think he means a bit of all three if I understand him correctly ?
1748 2018-09-25 20:42:36 Try olive oil!

1750 2018-09-25 20:42:25 Thats what i was told a the time. It was said that it blew debris, smoke and engine oil down many an MOT lane.
1751 2018-09-25 20:42:25 Obviously no oil or riches for the western governments to worry about.. #prayforthem  #evilinthisworld #notthechildren
1752 2018-09-25 20:42:20 You need some coconut oil for that hair getting a lil frizzy, but other than that you a goddess ma 
1753 2018-09-25 20:42:11 Isn’t it time that @ColgateUK drop the dirtiest palm oil giant and single biggest threat to Indonesian rainforests - Wilmar. An absolute disgrace. No more excuses, show your customers you can do the right thing!
1754 2018-09-25 20:42:10 Tiny flames went darting up the wood like swift red mice, skating over the oil and leaping from bark to branch to leaf.
1755 2018-09-25 20:42:02 The #rainforests are our planet’s beating heart & the #orangutans that swing in the trees of #Indonesia are one of its most precious creatures. Don’t let dirty #palmoil destroy this. I’m calling on @PepsiCo’s CEO @IndraNooyi to stop dealing with palm oil villain @Indofood

1759 2018-09-25 20:41:52 You laugh, but I'm reading what oil&gas cos. are saying about 1631 in WA, and it's basically that. "We support climate policy, but not the kind that would raise the costs of fossil fuels."

1762 2018-09-25 20:41:43 Specific to this thread (long oil) I will send reports tomorrow arguing for short oil. More generally I seem to mostly read (or pay attention to?) reports that demolish my trades. Like Trump/Brexit will destroy markets! They kdidn't (yet), so my point is, what news can we trust?
1763 2018-09-25 20:41:41 It occurs to me that if we are willing to sacrifice the health of our children to line the pockets of oil and gas, we need to rework our priorities.
1764 2018-09-25 20:41:37 Drink it in water? Why? What does it taste like that way? I’ve had the oil on a tea before. I love the smell of frankincense though.
1765 2018-09-25 20:41:37 Got out of oil about a year ago because of a predetermined timeline. Big time regret, on the flip it was a great learning experience

1767 2018-09-25 20:41:17 Dang, at least they're good quality. Kind of want to put in my own order for some now. 

Anyway,  try some kind of oil based cleanser. Mineral oil or coconut oil or even a bit of cooking oil + warm water should yank the sticky right off of that thing.
1768 2018-09-25 20:41:14 And what role has our sanctions played in destabilizing the elected government of Venezuela? Any thoughts on their oil properties and how we can seize them with a fabricated humanitarian military mission?
1769 2018-09-25 20:41:14 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that

1784 2018-09-25 20:40:21 Incorporating an oil rather than a moisturiser personally for me has many more benefits. Sweet almond oil for example prevents acne and scarring and naturally brightens your skin. It's one of two oils (jojoba) that are closest in structure to the sebum in your skin.
1785 2018-09-25 20:40:16 The sheer number of people who don’t know how to change their own car’s oil is alarming and upsetting. Learn about your car, damn it. You depend on that thing, you should respect it.

1789 2018-09-25 20:39:46 Allow your skin breathe and do not apply anything for some days. Wash your face with cold water during this period, then go cop some neem oil and use that before you sleep.

1809 2018-09-25 20:37:14 Just got my oil changed WITHOUT my dad’s assistance. That was so frightening, and I’m never doing that again.
1810 2018-09-25 20:37:07 With numerous excuses such as low oil prices which is not the case now. Yet nothing remarkable has been done or is being done apart from mortgaging the present & future of Nigerians born & unborn through reckless loans, high level of corruption, increased cost of governance
1811 2018-09-25 20:37:00 you joke about this, but i have tried making an essential oil vape blend (it didn't really work but that may be bc i'm not a vape person)

1814 2018-09-25 20:36:41 This means we are now a net exporter. This thanks to the export of natural gas mainly. We also export more crude oil. Energy independent mainly means we could supply our own energy needs.

1878 2018-09-25 20:29:55 Power + .... oil   
1879 2018-09-25 20:29:50 We’re taking 4L of Olive Oil Home from Crete tomorrow and there’s part of me who feels this is insufficient
1880 2018-09-25 20:29:49 I was making dinner earlier and a lot of hot oil went on my skin so now i have a lot of red marks and im in significant pain
1881 2018-09-25 20:29:46 What?! @PepsiCo STILL profits from exploitation #palmoil? Tell CEO @IndraNooyi to end her deals with palm oil villains @Indofood now
1882 2018-09-25 20:29:45 if i use oil paint on this canvas tote i bought it should work, right? like will the design get messed up or whatever when i fold or wash the bag?
1883 2018-09-25 20:29:44 AFTER SIRYA , LIBYA, IRAQ NEXT IS VENECUELA, WHY THIS COUNTRY IS TARGET - ANSWER IS THIS , VENECUELA IS BIGGEST OWNER OF OIL RESERVE IN THE WORLD. FUCK AMERICA. RUSSIA AND CHINA MUST MAKE MILITARY BASSES IN VENECUELA.
1884 2018-09-25 20:29:43 They already changed the recipe, because palm oil is cheap. They never used palm oil in the past. Palm oil and high fructose corn syrup are part of the obesity epidemic, as well as deforestation. Manufacturers only care about profits, and screw the planet.
1885 2018-09-25 20:29:41 Hmmm, #manitoba!  Isn't that north of the border? Like in #Canada!  I kind of think the #canucks would also like $80 plus oil also, wouldn't they (you)? #tcot #maga
1886 2018-09-25 20:29:37 Don’t like the taste of #deforestation and #humanrights abuse in your Pepsi? Join me and RT to tell @PepsiCo CEO @IndraNooyi to cut ties with deplorable palm oil business partner @Indofood in her final week as CEO
1887 2018-09-25 20:29:35 Bonsoir, j’avais cru lire, il y a longtemps, que 30% du vocabulaire anglais venait du français (en fait du normand, donc de la langue d’oïl). Quelle est votre source pour ce 80% d’origine latine ?
1888 2018-09-25 20:29:35 Isn’t it time that @Ritzcrackers drop the dirtiest palm oil giant and single biggest threat to Indonesian rainforests - Wilmar. An absolute disgrace. No more Ritz Crackers in this house until we see some change.

2. rinse,season & flour in bag. shake

1897 2018-09-25 20:28:44 Did you know that Pepsi has a palm oil problem? I want @IndraNooyi, the CEO of @PepsiCo to take responsibility for destroying #orangutans precious rainforest home and end her deals with dodgy #palmoil company @Indofood today!
1898 2018-09-25 20:28:25 OH THANK GOD i thought you wouldn’t like a greasy olive oil wolf uwu

1901 2018-09-25 20:28:14 Lmao I’m getting an oil change and I accidentally left my blunt in the car
1902 2018-09-25 20:28:09 She needs a little argan oil on those ends
1903 2018-09-25 20:28:02 Lord knows i don’t feel like going to get an oil change today 
1904 2018-09-25 20:28:01 A dip to check the oil... it's so expensive !!!
1905 2018-09-25 20:27:46 Did you know that you could apparently freeze olive oil and it turns into this greasy solid slime consistency? SQUISH
1906 2018-09-25 20:27:42 Always wanted an extra hand. Now more than ever if this takes off. 
1907 2018-09-25 20:27:40 I think most economic arguments that do not factor collapse of oil..and a future with trending lower prices linked with Nigeria's dependency. Are not being factual. Unless PDP  will raise price per barrel I do not see who will do better.
1908 2018-09-25 20:27:35 I love robotic oil poffins~!
1909 2018-09-25 20:27:24 Other dictators in other countries do shitty stuff but no invasions there. No oil I guess
1910 2018-09-25 20:27:17 Very good..hopefully you discussed better refineries: Monday’s WCS close surpasses a previous record discount of $41.50 reached in November 2013.

1912 2018-09-25 20:26:57 The green olives are pulled early because they have a different taste and are good for making olive oil. It's the same tree, not a different type.

1915 2018-09-25 20:26:44 Oil Billionaires??? There’s only one person that attacks those oil folks you speak of. That’s Trump but you obviously don’t listen. It’s sad that someone against oil business can hate Trump. You’re clueless, he just brought it up today at the UN
1916 2018-09-25 20:26:41 Yeah, we're gonna start talking about that, cuz if there's a problem w the oil consumption too, we're in serious trouble.
1917 2018-09-25 20:26:37 Lautech, midnight and palm oil?
Baddest combination
1918 2018-09-25 20:26:37 You didn't ask, but my go to salad is spring mix or kale or spinach, banana peppers and feta with a salt, pepper and olive oil dressing. 
If the main course is salad, I'll add meat or salmon. And if I have them, I'll throw in craisins.
1919 2018-09-25 20:26:32 Costco for olive oil you can trust
1920 2018-09-25 20:26:31 You have any topic in mind?
1921 2018-09-25 20:26:26 no they use peanut oil to fry both chicken and waffle fries
1922 2018-09-25 20:26:26 They already operate in Canada. Canada has the toughest environmental laws around oil and gas in the world. Violations cost $100s of millions if not adhered to
1923 2018-09-25 20:26:19 getting my oil changed finally and the kid doing it has tattoos and vans and is super cute and I’m in love, welcome to another story about me falling in love with strangers
1924 2018-09-25 20:26:18 In historical terms Derby are at least as big as City before Arab oil money
1925 2018-09-25 20:26:13 And just how many of those oil companies are Nationalised industries to benefit ordinary Scots? Not a one, no wonder Norway is doing so well when they own the actual oil company extracting the largest amount of oil whereas we're crippled by an incompetent UK management. 
1926 2018-09-25 20:26:05 apparently an oil tanker crashed
1927 2018-09-25 20:25:46 Oil of joy
1928 2018-09-25 20:25:41 Of course but the quiet fellow won’t appreciate you raising these issues that he himself never encouraged . That is my concern not the snake oil salesman

1931 2018-09-25 20:25:18 I’m nervous to try castor oil because they can pass their first poop and that can be dangerous for them  my friend said it sent her into labor within 24Hrs thou
1932 2018-09-25 20:24:54 Correct.  EUR’s treatment of gold makes it “unsinkable.”  Prob why these oil exporters keep wanting to price in EUR instead of USD.

1955 2018-09-25 20:23:57 LOL NICE TRY!

1972 2018-09-25 20:22:15 I failed to understand Trump’s point about a higher oil price. US producers are gaining enough cash for their new projects and secure the long term, on the other hand China needs to pay more for its oil imports, so less cash for domination plans. LOL

1980 2018-09-25 20:21:11 I have really dry skin, and my favorite oil is from youth to the people. My favorite serum is from guidance to glow on instagram. I also love drunk elephants oil and amorepacific botanical oil, favorite primer is tacha silk canvas&cleanse of oil from mac (I made a vid on insta)
1981 2018-09-25 20:21:11 I did this very stupid thing when I was a small kid.

Although rats were everywhere, you’d never stop chasing them and killing...

I placed a small piece of yam with oil on a sideway jar, and waited...1/
1982 2018-09-25 20:21:03 Oh dear, it's a funny idea but putting toys that have motors and have oil to make the gears move is pretty gross, it like if you put a rusty nail as a decoration into a cake and ate it.
1983 2018-09-25 20:21:00 I came to get my oil changed & I have to wait here for about an hour & my headphones are not working... this is great

2004 2018-09-25 20:19:42 Trump has long claimed that his predecessors’ weak leadership prompted other nations “to laugh” at the US. Some in the audience grumbled during Trump’s remarks when he said “we reject the ideology” of globalism and criticized Germany for agreeing to an oil pipeline with Russia.
2005 2018-09-25 20:19:42 It's @PepsiCo CEO @IndraNooyi's final week, but she still hasn't fixed Pepsi's #palmoil problem. I want her to save the #orangutans and leave a legacy free from #rainforest #deforestation & #workerabuse - by dropping palm oil villain @Indofood now!
2006 2018-09-25 20:19:29 #PalmOil is causing havoc to Indonesian forests & wildlife. @PepsiCo is fuelling this, through business partnership with one of the industry’s worst offenders @Indofood. RT to join me in calling on CEO @IndraNooyi to end Pepsi’s palm oil crimes
2007 2018-09-25 20:19:25 Renault announced today an 'Battery storage system' for used EV batteries. It owns a substantial share of Russian automaker VAZ. The Russians are not interested in EV's; they have a petro-economy. Renault has also had for many years an association with Elf oil - existing today>>
2008 2018-09-25 20:19:23 Yea several times I asked dr after seizure u took blood test I go so I got no diseases he was like. No but u got bad suriousus and told me keep oil on it
2009 2018-09-25 20:19:14 A few models of chevy and ford is inadequate to capture majority domestic market.
I didn't say Tesla is foreign, read again, I said "costly and inconvenient"
What the hell does oil prices have anything to do with car prices?!?
2010 2018-09-25 20:19:10 It was roasted in the oven ;) There is no Styrofoam. Just olive oil, and 4 season pepper.
2011 2018-09-25 20:19:09 Spontaneous combustion of linseed oil soaked rags is well documented. So I'm more for the arson plot

2013 2018-09-25 20:18:55 Or, just build refineries here already.  My husband is paying $2 a gallon for gasoline in the US.  Oil business is booming there.  Wonder why?  Oh, right, because, they've fucked ours so they can refine our *shitty* oil and resell it on the open market... How could I forget?
2014 2018-09-25 20:18:44 Iran has got oil 
Iran has got gas
Iran has got mineral material
Iran has got lots of tourism attractions
Iran has got fertile fields
Iran has got sea
Iran has got alot of jungles
And Iran has got the so talent people 
But
All of these are occupied

2015 2018-09-25 20:18:44 Yes it is..better refineries is the answer: Monday’s WCS close surpasses a previous record discount of $41.50 reached in Nov 2013. 
Light synthetic crude from the oil sands for Oct delivery settled at $17.75 under WTI, recovering slightly from $18.90 under.
2016 2018-09-25 20:18:26 Situational awareness:

And if IRAN closes 
Strait of Hormuz is a strait between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman 17,000 tons of Oil pass daily.
2017 2018-09-25 20:18:15 Stop buying palm oil from companies destroying rainforest, @Ritzcrackers. Orang-utans shouldn't have to die for your product. Drop Wilmar and keep your promise of no deforestation palm oil by 2020. #DropDirtyPalmOil
2018 2018-09-25 20:18:12 As in “defend our oil supply for nothing”.
2019 2018-09-25 20:18:09 That the mind and body are 2 separate things and the mind has a lot of influence on the body, a good example is the lupus girl when she took a dangerous dose with the rose perfume and cod oil

2025 2018-09-25 20:17:32 Pepsi profits from dirty palm oil. Unless CEO @IndraNooyi takes responsibility and ends @PepsiCo’s business deal with #palmoil offender @Indofood, Pepsi will continue to prop up the destruction of Indonesia’s #rainforests and #orangutans
2026 2018-09-25 20:17:27 Do they do what Little Oil wants???
2027 2018-09-25 20:17:26 Did you know that Pepsi has a palm oil problem? I want @IndraNooyi, the CEO of @PepsiCo to take responsibility for destroying #orangutans precious rainforest home and end her deals with dodgy #palmoil company @Indofood today!

2036 2018-09-25 20:16:54 My life when I lived in a mountain hipster cult back east was basically spending all the money we made on heating oil so we could not use it and only heat with the woodstove because goddamn that heating oil is too expensive to use.
2037 2018-09-25 20:16:51 @elonmusk Tell me about the possibility`s of electric Planes !! ?? Will this be possible for far future transportation ? Or when oil runs out planes are grounded ?

2042 2018-09-25 20:16:03 We need better refineries not TMX. Monday’s WCS close surpasses a previous record discount of $41.50 reached in Nov 2013.

2044 2018-09-25 20:15:53 Hmm wonder if caps were CBD oil  

I’m all for it if it helps with anxiety, pain & sleep. Hopefully they’ll keep perfecting the various strains so we can select the right product for our needs.

I have friends who take THC gummies for sleep (heavy body feeling) & CBD for pain.
2045 2018-09-25 20:15:34 Sure because you cannot have enough players out of position.  MIDDELTON FIRE THE GM AND CAPTAIN COCONUT OIL.   OR BE PREAPARED FOR CROWDS REACHING 15000.
2046 2018-09-25 20:15:33 Yes, I agree. But this does concern many Canadians that work in the oil industry that affect millions of families livelihoods.
2047 2018-09-25 20:15:13 The car is 10 years old & has 84,000 miles on it. The bigger problem is if there's actually something wrong w its oil consumption cuz then we're screwed.
2048 2018-09-25 20:15:11 When Oil spillage occurs, agriculture and fishing becomes difficult.

2050 2018-09-25 20:15:07 France is ranked 74th in the world in oil production. Hardly an economic sacrifice for them. It’s like Canada bragging about getting out of The Pineapple industry!! .....you should be ashamed of posting this drivel.
2051 2018-09-25 20:15:00 @BingingWBabish you use alot of vegetable oil. Its all synthetic. Only plants that you can cold press oil from are true (olive,coconut,palm).. Enzyme manufacturing, somewhat caustic.

2077 2018-09-25 20:12:32 Fantastic, like barrel bombs and shells to the middle easterners for their oil.
2078 2018-09-25 20:12:23 Umm, we are afraid to make Saudi Arabia mad lest they monkey around with the oil supply. We wouldn't even take them to task when 19/20 of the 9/11 hijackers were Saudi.
2079 2018-09-25 20:12:16 Very familiar with markets and our economic growth. Specifically, I was referring to Saudi Arabia which pays nothing to us in our defense of them and we have not benefitted in any way with regard to let’s say oil prices. Look also at Japan. Fair is all I am suggesting.
2080 2018-09-25 20:12:09 @realDonaldTrump do not doubt that you will be defeated in the November election, you know, I'm not mistaken. The complete cessation of Iranian oil exports is vital to us and to you.
2081 2018-09-25 20:12:01 I dug out a backstrap from the freezer Sunday. 3 year old venison.  Cleaned it up seasoned it, fried it in #castarn and coconut oil last night with a half an onion in the middle of the skillet.  #realfood #weknowhowtocook

2087 2018-09-25 20:11:41 @realDonaldTrump My relationship with Pompeo was good. When our relationship broke down, he spoke of the impasse in oil sanctions, he crossed our red line and saw how our relationship was. If sanctions are exempted, my relationship with President Trump will be much worse
2088 2018-09-25 20:11:05 I cant drink water because im 90% oil from all the junk food i consume
2089 2018-09-25 20:10:53 Who cares. Saudi Arabia has less than  400B in cash reserves, they would not last as long as our strategic oil reserve would. Not happening
2090 2018-09-25 20:10:47 .@TheNoeShow The oil in the chips absorbs the atmosphere around them.  Happens in offices or car or wherever.  So they taste like the inside of your car.
2091 2018-09-25 20:10:39 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.

2106 2018-09-25 20:09:09 I'm not going to sugar-coat it: The #McCann$' snake oil salesman Clarence Mitchell is a dickhead. He's so arrogant, he doesn't realise how foolish he is.  #Risible
2107 2018-09-25 20:09:08 I agree with free trade on most items but not milk. You have a huge market behind you. There has been a lot of foreign interference, mainly American in our politics that have greatly hindered us getting our oil to tidewater. Your already getting our oil for a deal!
2108 2018-09-25 20:09:06 Or Canada.. But we do oil pipelines
2109 2018-09-25 20:09:03 @Ritzcrackers I love you guys, but PLEASE stop using palm oil in your produce. Surely you can find or create a substitute that doesn’t destroy our planet...? Support @Greenpeace @GreenpeaceUK

2113 2018-09-25 20:08:37 Certainly - as always, the free market will ultimately set prices and demand.  Unfortunately, @JustinTrudeau has painted us into a corner with no way to access free market pricing for our oil. We are all poorer as a result. Higher deficits and more debt!
2114 2018-09-25 20:08:36 Oh yes, it will help the confidence and the fact its developable using existing infrastructure is showing the way. Oil is over $80.00 per barrel due to Russia and Saudi not helping America after the Iran sanctions but it could all change in a week!
2115 2018-09-25 20:08:31 So people who use anecdotal evidence with zero qualifications are now medically qualified? 

The journalist criticized her but wasn't peddling out her own diet business. Therefore I hold the journalist under much less scrutiny. The person selling snake oil is more responsible.

2118 2018-09-25 20:08:18 Should wash our hands of middle east, stop buying their oil, stop arming them and let them murder each other with swords and knives. Including Israel. It's not NYT, Post etc. It's oil conglomerates and MIC. That's the "deep state"

2124 2018-09-25 20:07:34 Just seen a girl season her chicken in coconut oil, pancake mix and Granola. What the actual fuck is that ?
2125 2018-09-25 20:07:31 Curious! Hearing that phrase from a feminist. Guess everybody is prone to slip-ups.
2126 2018-09-25 20:07:20 WHY TF IS TEA TREE OIL SO DAMN EXPENSIVE
2127 2018-09-25 20:07:19 Pepsi profits from dirty palm oil. Unless CEO @IndraNooyi takes responsibility and ends @PepsiCo’s business deal with #palmoil offender @Indofood, Pepsi will continue to prop up the destruction of Indonesia’s #rainforests and #orangutans

2129 2018-09-25 20:06:57 Mate. There are no bad foods. Just bad recipes. Parsnips and sweet potato are AMAZING. Roast parsnips with olive oil salt red chilli flakes honey garlic. Thank me later.
2130 2018-09-25 20:06:54 More is never enough. It's not oil, it's not money. It's power. Owning all the stuff. Being able to treat others badly. Trump followers make the mistake of thinking that because they are white they will be at the top of the hill. Instead they are Bob & Mayella Ewell.
2131 2018-09-25 20:06:40 I've never really understood why, if the chancesof finding oil are so slim, you wouldn't continue letting people last pay to have a look

2133 2018-09-25 20:06:37 there are ways to short oil indirectly without the risk. like going long airline dips. $USO vs $AAL 4ex. find right levels. tons o trades
2134 2018-09-25 20:06:30 After toning I use the Poppy Austin vitamin C with hyaluronic acid serum and the Poppy Austin rosehip oil. I finish off with the Clinique 72hr moisture surge. This combo is my fav.

2136 2018-09-25 20:06:19 Western demand for oil is too high to allow gadaffi dictate the price of oil. 
Fiat monetary policy using quantitative easing and interest rate changes is able to maintain annual inflation at 2%. That would have been impossible to achieve and all fiat would be rendered obsolete.

2175 2018-09-25 20:02:19 Why would he? He wasn't there promoting them. He was there to highlight that they might want to consider buying oil from Alberta. 

Admit it, the NDP doesn't want the world buying our oil. That is what makes all of you no longer electable in Alberta.

2179 2018-09-25 20:01:48 Well the problem with the rule Obama had was basically he was saying trains can't carry the oil. The systems not ready for the brakes even if the brakes brakes were on the train all the tracks aren't set up to use them stop being a troll

2183 2018-09-25 20:01:33 In Venezuela, the majority of oil comes in sand form with very low API ( <14). Thus, it’s very expensive to extract and produce. The cost would be very high and not feasible.

2196 2018-09-25 20:00:09 And how realistic is this? Not very much. This kind of behavioural change is even more drastic then weaning people off oil consumption, which as we know is already a problem we cannot overcome.

2202 2018-09-25 19:59:41 So, you think a carbon is the answer to fixing this? Big polluters such as the auto industry or oil producers already invest large $ to green innovation, and is much more effective than any govt involvement would be.

2215 2018-09-25 19:58:12 He has already. U.S. is producing more oil and he has removed every regulation to ensure that alternate technologies thrive and thus in the long run bring down oil prices. He is in our own words ' lambhe race khi khiladi'.

2243 2018-09-25 19:56:07 Would depend on your needs. Expensive cleansers aren't worth it to me, I use Cetaphil. Cetaphil toner. I use Herbivore's Lapis Oil in the am and then moon fruit at night. They have a resurfacing blue tansy mask every other day. I use neat Manuka oil overnight one a week.

2247 2018-09-25 19:55:53 NEW YORK-UAE OFFICIAL, REACTING TO TRUMP'S REBUKE OF OPEC AND HIGH OIL PRICES, SAYS "AT THE END OF THE DAY WE ALL KNOW THAT OIL PRICES ARE DRIVEN BY MARKETS' ... while that could be true, we are living in a time where market overseers regularly conduct open market operations.

2250 2018-09-25 19:55:36 @realDonaldTrump ...The President should release extra oil from US Reserves !!!
2251 2018-09-25 19:55:30 Fine. Let those 37 states whose largest trading partner happens to be Canada find a new dumping ground for their goods. We can sell our oil and wheat anywhere.

2253 2018-09-25 19:55:24 something I found helpful for curing an ear infection as I have had many, is to completely stop up your ear with oil and then toilet paper, oil bc paper is rough, also it's necessary for dunking in the tub, which helps w/fungus on your skin and hair(clean hair is a must)
2254 2018-09-25 19:55:13 @RitzCrackers is one of the brands that are still buying dirty palm oil from rainforest destroyers! The first step to stop deforestation is to stop working with companies like Wilmar. #DropDirtyPalmOi

2258 2018-09-25 19:54:35 Sadly this seat will be filled by @MittRomney  a spineless squishy RINO carbon copy of @JeffFlake 
41 years for @senorrinhatch , and R's not any closer to dismantling prog gains since 30's.
Dimms just pick up where they left off, march forward again.
2259 2018-09-25 19:54:33 I think the oil companies were backing a carbon tax insofar as they were low enough to ensure no reduction in oil consumption, and the revenue neutrality part was simply them negotiating with their far right allies on how to make sure climate policy also cuts taxes.
2260 2018-09-25 19:54:29 I’m a medical marijuana patient but oddly the only things marijuana does for me is make my eyes red and dry, and give me acid reflux. That being said, I recommend you try CBD oil bc it helps a lot of people. #spoonie
2261 2018-09-25 19:54:28 Really tough one. But going with Gaddafi. Would have liked to have seen his vision of trading oil by gold instead of the dollar.
2262 2018-09-25 19:54:11 I love the oil coz it accommodates different types of dishes. Although u have to get one thts low on these preservatives.

The only thing I never tried was CBD oil.

I should have... but that wasn't an option.

2268 2018-09-25 19:53:55 Might be the minority here but I’d HATE some oil tycoon to come and buy the company and just give us £200m a year to spend on players. 

There’s no fun. There’s no challenge. The plastic fans would be everywhere. We’d lose our entire philosophy and what it means to be spurs :(

2273 2018-09-25 19:53:46 I'm not sure why EPS & FPSOs are not more common. I've always assumed its because of gas handling. If you have to build a gas export line, the benfits to using tankers for the oil is marginal once you factor in GoM's extensive pipeline infrastructure.
2274 2018-09-25 19:53:42 @EmmanuelMacron Thinks That The World Price of Oil Would Drop If Iran Could Sell It's Oil on International Markets ( And It Would ! - It Would Also Probably Continue To Finance Worldwide Terrorism, Such As The #Bataclan + #CharlieHebdo Events in France ! )
2275 2018-09-25 19:53:36 It was rather rhetoric question...  The answer is in paper "forest conversion for mining, oil and gas production, industrial agriculture, and urbanization is typically permanent."  Or: we have to stop and reverse the current developments if we want to survive as species...

me in my head: WELL ACTUALLY thieves oil has been around since mid 15th century as the name is derived from thieves in France who robbed graves & formulated a concoction of scents such as rosemary lemon eucal
2315 2018-09-25 19:48:55 Calling yourself anti-war and taking sides in a war certainly does not make sense. Especially in a war that is all about regional political power and oil, not about improving people's lives.

2322 2018-09-25 19:48:18 I don't have to listen to the whole speech.I caught enough excerpts from radio news.

2384 2018-09-25 19:42:05 "Would have stopped crude oil." You mean like, on the tracks. Before it comes flying off by the tank? We're MUCH SAFER having crude on the trains than in pipelines. At least when one tank bursts, its not a 300 mile pipe of it. I'm a "liberal" I like trains that don't crash.

2435 2018-09-25 19:37:24 So there's a limited number of bitcoin, but there's a limited amount of gold or bauxite or oil and the prices for all of those things vary a lot based on whatever we want to say drives commodities markets.

2494 2018-09-25 19:32:17 Does this include heavy crude reserves? It doesn’t appear it does because including that, Venezuela has more oil reserves than the rest of the world combined.

2502 2018-09-25 19:31:40 I saw how he was reacting and decided to fuck with him. He probably honestly believes that I think his mom is getting $500 oil changes. If she is she's getting hoed and paying for things that she doesn't need. But I was more than happy to mess with him about it.

2504 2018-09-25 19:31:33 Greek salad—lots of olives, feta, olive oil, maybe some nuts in there too. Yum.

2506 2018-09-25 19:31:14 The government of Mongolia has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley in a muslin wig.
2507 2018-09-25 19:31:14 What?! @PepsiCo STILL profits from exploitation #palmoil? Tell CEO @IndraNooyi to end her deals with palm oil villains @Indofood now
2508 2018-09-25 19:31:13 There are interesting recent flow assurance #innovations being discussed at the #atce2018 special session on now... particularly relevant to ensure industry stays #resilient at lower oil price environments...
2509 2018-09-25 19:31:05 Yea ima need a lil shawty to come do oil treatments to my curls 
2510 2018-09-25 19:30:54 Don’t like the taste of #deforestation and #humanrights abuse in your Pepsi? Join me and RT to tell @PepsiCo CEO @IndraNooyi to cut ties with deplorable palm oil business partner @Indofood in her final week as CEO
2511 2018-09-25 19:30:33 Venezuela tells the tale. Oil rich and affluent- now people eating out of dumpsters. Trump has put one over on all of you. He portrays himself as simple while the genius has backed you into a corner.  The storm is upon you...swift and relentless.
2512 2018-09-25 19:30:31 Not to mention the fact that the temporary "reprieve" from the 8% VAT on fuels is going to be brief. Rising oil prices [north of $ 82 today] + weaker KES = trouble.
2513 2018-09-25 19:30:30 I own a Discovery 5 and its been in the garage 4 times due to oil dilution problem even though the car travels on the motorway every week, I have been blamed for driver performance but your car is not fit for purpose.

2515 2018-09-25 19:30:28 @Ritzcrackers Please stop using Wilmar unsafe and unsustainable 'dirty' palm oil. Prevent the orang-utangs and other wildlife that are being dispossessed and dying out, due to Wilmar's operations. Ritz, we expect more of you.
2516 2018-09-25 19:30:22 He doesn’t want hot oil pouring on his leg, he would have to stop cooking next year. So he wants to save up enough marry and do marriage. Wife makes meal,man is happy 
2517 2018-09-25 19:30:11 I try to but when I do I seal it with a thick oil like black castor oil
2518 2018-09-25 19:30:10 Please maintain a safe distance from the hot oil spray.
2519 2018-09-25 19:30:05 oil lamp? bring louis back!
2520 2018-09-25 19:29:43 The only thing Donnie Boy, Jr. knows about oil is what he uses on his hair and on his new girlfriend.
2521 2018-09-25 19:29:40 we really need all the money we can. Oil is at about 80 dollars per barrel now
2522 2018-09-25 19:29:39 It's @PepsiCo CEO @IndraNooyi's final week, but she still hasn't fixed Pepsi's #palmoil problem. I want her to save the #orangutans and leave a legacy free from #rainforest #deforestation & #workerabuse - by dropping palm oil villain @Indofood now!
2523 2018-09-25 19:29:33 Pepsi profits from dirty palm oil. Unless CEO @IndraNooyi takes responsibility and ends @PepsiCo’s business deal with #palmoil offender @Indofood, Pepsi will continue to prop up the destruction of Indonesia’s #rainforests and #orangutans
2524 2018-09-25 19:29:28 Just did a happy dance in my car after finding out St.Lawrence has white oil paint and I’ve been needing it for so long  #finally
2525 2018-09-25 19:29:14 He said he is “unsubscribing” from the bachelor life next year. He did not say because he is getting old or because he found the love of his life. He said because hot oil poured on his leg.. it’s a clear message in itself. He doesn’t want hot oil to pour on his leg
2526 2018-09-25 19:29:11 What?! @PepsiCo STILL profits from exploitation #palmoil? Tell CEO @IndraNooyi to end her deals with palm oil villains @Indofood now
2527 2018-09-25 19:29:11 What is he complaining about? Trump is getting Canadian oil at a fantastic discount. Still no love for Canada, though.
2528 2018-09-25 19:29:10 This is about oil and gas development and I guarantee you Anadarko doesn't give one rats ass about "John's" property rights.  They want the people of Colorado to pay them to not poison those same people.  It's just that simple.
2529 2018-09-25 19:29:08 As activists talked about protests started again in Basra this time outside West Qurna 2 oil field and in Basra city
2530 2018-09-25 19:29:08 nope, still laughing when he was finished. that's the difference between trying to sell snake oil to adults, rather than morons at his rallies

smart people fact check his bullsh*t
2531 2018-09-25 19:29:08 Two hours for a oil change  somebody need to pull up with some woods

That won't happen.

We're your largest military vehicle manufacturer, oil producer and trading partner, and softwood lumber producer...

If he could have, he would have.

Grow up.
2534 2018-09-25 19:28:38 We're looking at high Brent oil price then. Nigeria will gain but 
2535 2018-09-25 19:28:32 Dear @IndraNooyi I heard about Pepsi’s palm oil problem and I really hope that you’ll cut ties with @Indofood in your final week as CEO. I love #orangutans and our #rainforests too. Don’t let them die for cheap #palmoil
2536 2018-09-25 19:28:20 maybe i will look into it! Avocado oil mask is what caused this!
2537 2018-09-25 19:28:15 Fry meat and keep aside. Slice onions and add to oil. I usually blend my tin tomatoes with the tomatoes. Pour the blended tomatoes and allow to fry. Add jollof rice spice, curry, thyme, salt and maggi to taste. Add bay leaves. Stir with a wooden stick.
2538 2018-09-25 19:28:15 A valid assessment of why 12,000 pallets of water went to waste, food rotted in containers, infrastructure was neglected would be warranted. But, the whole focus will be that we should send MORE, bigger Gov/mo $ is the answer while trying it to Trump #bailout
2539 2018-09-25 19:28:12 Does he want their oil too?
2540 2018-09-25 19:28:09 Someone pls tell oil equities to wake up!!
2541 2018-09-25 19:28:09 Castor oil packs!
2542 2018-09-25 19:28:08 Well we are increasing the spending to the 3% mark, which is what Nato members agreed on. If you think Russia is our main 'foe?' Yes why would we not buy cheaper Russian oil instead of having Oil transported from the Us which is more expensive in both price and shipment
2543 2018-09-25 19:27:53 Photo of Frau from Dodgeball appears....or Olive Oil.
2544 2018-09-25 19:27:51 Hopes doing Brooke’s hair while I’m getting hopes oil changed & I really hope my 2 moms don’t start getting chatty & get me in trouble

2546 2018-09-25 19:27:44 Yes, exactly, we drink the coconut water, eat the flesh,but the oil, like you said for application.
2547 2018-09-25 19:27:42 Drink 5l of hot fishoil not cooking oil
2548 2018-09-25 19:27:29 Oil based makeup removers scare me. I won’t do it
2549 2018-09-25 19:27:25 Oh no defo not palm oli. But I can see this bring a hit with just regular oil and penne or fusilli pasta. 

Thinking about it is even making me hungry.
2550 2018-09-25 19:27:23 Yes, exactly.  Sanctions by the US & NATO-allies created the economic crisis in the first place.  Now they want to 'save the country' by forcefully overthrowing the legitimate govt. We all know they're just after the oil, and Maduro is standing in their way.

2553 2018-09-25 19:26:59 finding an $18 off coupon for your oil change>
2554 2018-09-25 19:26:59 Why does it always take Americans to do something? What's the matter with the oil kingdoms of the Middle East? The people in this photo are Muslims. Why don't incredibly rich Muslim oil sheikhs help starving Muslims?
2555 2018-09-25 19:26:58 What's a good cod liver oil that you recommend?
2556 2018-09-25 19:26:43 Oh and don't forget the Almond oil to use as a moisturizer after you use the Black Seed soap.
2557 2018-09-25 19:26:41 OPEC has dismissed Trump's calls to increase production. "The markets are adequately supplied," Falih said Sunday, according to Reuters. "I don't know of any refiner in the world who is looking for oil and is not able to get it."
2558 2018-09-25 19:26:40  ahh hell what if I need an oil change ?
2559 2018-09-25 19:26:40 @RitzCrackers is one of the brands that are still buying dirty palm oil from rainforest destroyers! The first step to stop deforestation is to stop working with companies like Wilmar. #DropDirtyPalmOil
2560 2018-09-25 19:26:39 An older man came in to get his oil painting (on a canvas board ) framed and actually asked “if I knew what I was doing”. Sir I have been custom framing for over a year and have my degree in painting, so yes I know what I am doing 
2561 2018-09-25 19:26:28 Listen Mr.Brain Petrol is being raised from 92 to 99 from 1st Oct and Carosene oil: 10 RS.

2564 2018-09-25 19:26:26 LA knows it's fall when their coconut oil goes solid.
2565 2018-09-25 19:26:14 @Ritzcrackers Stop buying palm oil from companies destroying rain forests.  I love orangutans
2566 2018-09-25 19:26:13 Oil
2567 2018-09-25 19:26:12 Have you looked into CBD for pain? No matter its source, it's not illegal. I live in a state where Cannabis is legal. Most dispensaries here carry CBD products. Health food stores carry hemp oil or will order it for you. I've met women who swear by it. CBD=cannabidiol.

2569 2018-09-25 19:26:05 Trevor Really Suppose To Be Getting This Oil Changed
2570 2018-09-25 19:26:04 Mummy got it Lavender essential oil and arnica

2573 2018-09-25 19:25:46 And its weird that art and associated services are always the ones that get hit with this bs. You normally don't see this issue with tradework that deals with housework or mechanics... Like imagine going in for an oil change and asking if they could do it for free lol.
2574 2018-09-25 19:25:44 #CafeOuKhan UPS thrived with rising oil prices because of efficiency
2575 2018-09-25 19:25:32 My coconut oil went solid overnight. Summer is over! 
2576 2018-09-25 19:25:31 I put some tea tree oil on my face & omg it burned so bad, it’s never felt like that before.
2577 2018-09-25 19:25:31 We get it. But jokes are not for everyone. Like truffle oil.
2578 2018-09-25 19:25:30 No time to explain right now. Catch you later after the oil change.
2579 2018-09-25 19:25:17 “Papi-Quill is spoiling me now.”

Lots of oil...
2580 2018-09-25 19:25:10 egg is so weird. want to make sure your bread dough holds together? throw a chicken fetus in that bitch. want a dipping sauce for your french fry? mix up a chicken fetus with some oil & hot sauce. going to a bar mitzvah? wear a dress made of chicken fetuses.

2582 2018-09-25 19:25:08 Pretty darn stupid, I would say, though I'm sure most of them (this being an elite University of Texas fraternity) are headlining at various law firms & oil companies.

2585 2018-09-25 19:24:48 today was a very rich day of oil inputs, Beats a JMMC.
2586 2018-09-25 19:24:46 Excuse me, I said energy not exclusively natural gas. Germany imports most of its fossil fuels and the biggest supplier for natural gas & oil is Russia and now including Russian coal since Germany is giving up domestic coal. Also, isn't gas closer to 1/4 of German energy?
2587 2018-09-25 19:24:46 When a snake oil salesman like him start promoting their technology etf funds like OGIG we are close to a top.
2588 2018-09-25 19:24:43 Then he put the hammer down! Germany chuckled when he mentioned they were going to be 100% reliant on Russian oil. They’re Government has taken a wrong turn under Merkel. She sold out her country to a Muslim invasion, with rampant lawlessness.

2590 2018-09-25 19:24:28 Síiiii eso mismo haré
2591 2018-09-25 19:24:24 No, Arthur. I am saying that you are a doofus. You asked for an example of how 'evolution has benefited us'. The development of the geological timescale as a direct implication of evolution is central to the geology that oil companies use to find the oil that you put in your car.
2592 2018-09-25 19:24:23 Don’t be fooled by this warmongering in the guise of peacekeeping - they want to get their hands on the worlds largest oil reserves in Venezuela

2594 2018-09-25 19:24:20 This coming month of October we plan to deal with three major areas. The first under the scope will be oil. The second on the scale we tackle currencies. Third we will look at the major ideas that we have presented since we started.

Muslims do nothing in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Ethiopia, Sudan, Chad, Nigeria, Libya, Mauritania, Ivory Coast
2607 2018-09-25 19:22:57 Doesn't the US import millions of barrels of crude oil every day?

2624 2018-09-25 19:21:30 The funny thing is, a lot of the phrases involving the other terms have some meaning if applied to Competency By Design. "CBD obstruction" could mean faculty who want it to go away. "CBD oil" could refer to zealous proponents.

2630 2018-09-25 19:20:37 Hillary Clinton wrote the foreign policy on libya. Gaddafis proposal was to require african countries to trade their countries oil reserves for only gold dinar instead of usd fiat which would empower gaddafi to inflate the price of the oil in the global wholesale markets.

2637 2018-09-25 19:20:09 My hair oil gresse is getting everywhere . I’m so shiny
2638 2018-09-25 19:20:08 Drink Mineral Water in the morning. Take 2 spoons of Dr.Bronner Coconut Oil all in the morning. May you be blessed with a natural weight loss. Also for weight loss natural eat a slice of tomato every morning before your first meal. Be blessed.
2639 2018-09-25 19:20:03 Grease in my hair...don't care.....I'm no longer an oil man...I'm a grease man..
2640 2018-09-25 19:19:54 Honest question - if you have a new or newer vehicle, do you go ahead with all the “recommended maintenance” or just the basics (oil changes, etc) unless something is no longer working?
2641 2018-09-25 19:19:53 Look at a map. Canadian oil isn going to India anytime soon.

This was all about fellow IDU members helping each other look good in advance of an election. If it had been for Alberta, the government would have been represented.

2643 2018-09-25 19:19:39 Trudeau wants to screw with the Oil Sands but he didn’t waste any time making sure the equalization payments kept heading east, the corrupt bastard!
2644 2018-09-25 19:19:34 When you shave and after you wash ya face put coconut oil it’ll grow like brazy
2645 2018-09-25 19:19:31 Lol red Tories indeed !  Big eck. The only left wing oil economist in history ! The party of Ian blackford  calling anyone Tories lol , brilliant
2646 2018-09-25 19:19:21 That’s nothing to brag about.. leave the oil in the ground and convert to clean solar power & other renewables. I want you to get re-elected b/c you’re a Democrat, but after re-election you should change your tune. Burning fossil fuels at the rate we burn it will kill us all!
2647 2018-09-25 19:19:19 Spending too much time on nonsense, as usual. 
FEMA has done an assessment of response, as they always do. 

The problem with your proposal is NO SCRUTINY will be had of corruption, institutional failures at point of use. 

Doesn't fit blame Trump agenda.

2651 2018-09-25 19:18:58 the electric car wont destroy the oil industry..it will just stop petrol manufacturing.   still need it for spray paint tha bankys like to use as a statement on war n shit..

yeh. a real hero..
2652 2018-09-25 19:18:47 Doesn't the CBD come from the hemp oil?
2653 2018-09-25 19:18:41 The real story is India has decided to not to buy oil from any one and use the oil from their own country atleast till trade talks w/ US and CHINA show improvement .
2654 2018-09-25 19:18:37 #PalmOil is causing havoc to Indonesian forests & wildlife. @PepsiCo is fuelling this, through business partnership with one of the industry’s worst offenders @Indofood. RT to join me in calling on CEO @IndraNooyi to end Pepsi’s palm oil crimes
2655 2018-09-25 19:18:31 So it was like  
I sit over her   then
She screamed for a while  
Thn i start riding her  
She start screaming af  
I put oil  but nothing happened n'
she keep moaning
Then Finally I relished that I really need to buy a new bicycle 
2656 2018-09-25 19:18:19 The #rainforests are our planet’s beating heart & the #orangutans that swing in the trees of #Indonesia are one of its most precious creatures. Don’t let dirty #palmoil destroy this. I’m calling on @PepsiCo’s CEO @IndraNooyi to stop dealing with palm oil villain @Indofood
2657 2018-09-25 19:18:16 Australian motorists should blame the incompetent leader of the USA for at least part of the reason they pay more for petrol. His idiotic abandoning of the Iran agreement is a major factor in pushing up oil prices.
2658 2018-09-25 19:18:16 American military illegally occupying a country to steal oil...
2659 2018-09-25 19:18:15 But Trump has major responsibility for the oil price increase due to his Iran policy? Doesn't he realise this?
2660 2018-09-25 19:18:11 Narok wanalipwa for wildlife, Turkana for oil , sasa naona @MungeBM mmenda kufunga maji Ndakaini unless mlipwe . Majimboism indeed. Nairobi residents should prepare to pay more for water.
2661 2018-09-25 19:18:06 Yes, agreed! They just want oil and gas.
2662 2018-09-25 19:18:03 A mechanic friend of mine told an apprentice to top up the oil in a customer's car. He did - all the way to the top of the rocker cover 
2663 2018-09-25 19:17:58 I hope I am wrong too but I am sure I will not be as I said 2 years ago that Syria was going to be used as bait with which to snare the number one enemy in the middle east, Iran. Trump pulling out of Iran deal is the pretext for war and Saudi needs $100 oil to survive.
2664 2018-09-25 19:17:42 WTF @RitzCrackers? You are still buying dirty palm oil from rainforest destroyers like Wilmar?                        The first step to stop deforestation is to stop working with Wilmar. #DropDirtyPalmOil
2665 2018-09-25 19:17:33 What?! @PepsiCo STILL profits from exploitation #palmoil? Tell CEO @IndraNooyi to end her deals with palm oil villains @Indofood now
2666 2018-09-25 19:17:20 Macron to Trump:  oil prices will fall  if Iran could sell its oil #OOTT #opec #logic

2668 2018-09-25 19:17:08 @Ritzcrackers stop buying palm oil from rainforest-destroying suppliers. Now!
2669 2018-09-25 19:17:06 Is Buhari the secretary of the Arab league?

We don't trade with them,  they ain't our neighbors, they don't buy our oil.. So what the heck when u are presiding over 87million poor people!
2670 2018-09-25 19:17:06 My mom just told me to use thc oil

2678 2018-09-25 19:16:19 Great read Richard, thanks for sharing. I have to say though I’m worried about the survival of the court artist, their oil pastels & iconic beige cartridge paper under your proposals.
2679 2018-09-25 19:16:07 So I’ve been driving the same truck for a couple days and the oil light has been on so I check it today and the hood broke and I had to switch trucks and now I’m so far behind
2680 2018-09-25 19:16:07 I've got a trainer, it's mad fun, but balisongs are sorta like arcade sticks, cheap ones aren't really worth buying and the only step up is like $300+ premium ones

Though you can usually DIY the cheap ones with some good oil and Locktite (I think it was called) and they're good
2681 2018-09-25 19:15:48 It's OBAMA caught on hot mic making backdoor deals with Putin, Obama who GAVE Russia an oil bearing island, Obama who sold them our plutonium stock CHEAP. Do research and stop parroting CNN.
2682 2018-09-25 19:15:47 I’ve been waiting over an hour at the oil change place  about to lose my mind!
2683 2018-09-25 19:15:45 #French President Emmanuel #Macron on Tuesday responded to U.S. President Donald Trump's criticism of high #oil prices, saying that if had not reimposed sanctions on #Tehran, prices would not have risen as much.
2684 2018-09-25 19:15:38 Oil pares gains as Trump repeats calls on OPEC to pump more: Oil prices rose on Tuesday but eased off a four-year high after U.S. President Donald Trump called on OPEC to increase crude output, even he as called for heavier sanctions on major oil producer Iran.
2685 2018-09-25 19:15:28 Oil should not come before making Iran accountable for its bloody sins in Syria and Yemen and the whole Middle East
2686 2018-09-25 19:15:26 Weren't the oil companies backing carbon taxes only insofar as they were revenue neutral, and this new carbon tax isn't?
2687 2018-09-25 19:15:25 I want some of mr McQueens motor oil 
2688 2018-09-25 19:15:21 I couldn't be arsed to like-and-subscribe to get past the popup, but I gathered there's a cubicle spewing lavender oil (ugh) and surrounded by rubber ducks?

2691 2018-09-25 19:15:14 Like just change my oil please.
2692 2018-09-25 19:14:58 San Siro Trump oil prices would fall if Iran could sell its oil
2693 2018-09-25 19:14:56 Would you buy a used car from this man? Snake oil? A bridge in Brooklyn?

2695 2018-09-25 19:14:31 It's @PepsiCo CEO @IndraNooyi's final week, but she still hasn't fixed Pepsi's #palmoil problem. I want her to save the #orangutans and leave a legacy free from #rainforest #deforestation & #workerabuse - by dropping palm oil villain @Indofood now!

2697 2018-09-25 19:14:27 * Except Wansink (), but those retractions are so recent they still have time to figure out what to say imo. They’ve updated their recommendations wrt fish oil and bcaas over time, though, that I can confirm.

My kitchen smells AMAZING and there’s a lot of love in the air.
2701 2018-09-25 19:14:01 They use Saudi and American oil that costs less to refine
2702 2018-09-25 19:14:00 The smell of olbas oil wafting down the stairs is lovely! 
2703 2018-09-25 19:13:58 Iran has got oil 
Iran has got gas
Iran has got mineral material
Iran has got lots of tourism attractions
Iran has got fertile fields
Iran has got sea
Iran has got alot of jungles
And Iran has got the so talent people 
But
All of these are occupied

2706 2018-09-25 19:13:48 I don't know the specifics but fish oil is not new. The last meta studies I've seen are that it basically does very little.

2708 2018-09-25 19:13:40 Depends of costs of extraction. Depends on the time period of extraction. The government only gets the tax from the profits of the oil companies.

2713 2018-09-25 19:13:07 Can’t wait for those minuscule tax “breaks” for 99% of us the expire. Along with higher gas and oil prices and higher food and goods prices, poverty will be at an all time high.  Thanks trump.
2714 2018-09-25 19:12:53 What gearbox oil do you put in a ktm 250 2 stank?? 
To clarify I don’t mean oil manufacturer!
2715 2018-09-25 19:12:52 I don't know how I feel about this... I know this is selfish, but don't you think we should keep oil here and take care of America?

Maybe the oil companies need some money really quick.
2716 2018-09-25 19:12:49 It's essentially a jar of sugar, vegetable oil, cocoa and one hazelnut. The European stuff is supposed to be better.
2717 2018-09-25 19:12:48 PSA: when getting your oil changed make sure the dumbass actually resets your oil light so you don’t have a heart attack when it comes on not even a month later #facepalm
2718 2018-09-25 19:12:42 If you know of a better way to transport oil I’d love to know about it.

2723 2018-09-25 19:12:31 Fool every country is going green. Who gives a shit about oil and clean coal.
2724 2018-09-25 19:12:26 I really hope you're wrong. Everyone suffers from high oil prices including Trump's base.
2725 2018-09-25 19:12:14 Lemme get that oil
2726 2018-09-25 19:12:12 @Ritzcrackers does your palm oil supplier, Wilmar, work in an ethically sustainable way? Or do you use 'dirty palm oil' in your products, the biggest threat to Indonesian rain forests?
2727 2018-09-25 19:12:10 I forgot I get free oil changes 
2728 2018-09-25 19:12:04 The only one who wants to fight it is Warren Buffet because currently he's making millions transporting on his railroads, which actually has frequent oil spills

2730 2018-09-25 19:11:57 No one outside of the oil and gas industry would know who @WBrettWilson was if it hadn't been for the CBC. Why are Conservatives like Bernier always playing the victim card?
2731 2018-09-25 19:11:38 Stop the Palm Oil !
2732 2018-09-25 19:11:22 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2733 2018-09-25 19:11:16 Does the President not remember that Venezuela was pushing hard for oil to be traded in EUs instead of US$.  This would absolutely devastate ie tank our economy.  Venezuela has been gunning for us for years.  They are not our friends. #BackOutOfTheRoom

2753 2018-09-25 19:09:23 So far today I've gone to my psychiatrists appointment, gotten an oil change, took a very long nap, and gotten 3 stars on the first 100 levels of Sailor Moon Drops. I guess that's something?
2754 2018-09-25 19:09:14 This one is a cleansing oil so basically before you wash your face, you take a cotton pad and just clean out all the dirt in your pores with this oil then you can wash your face. I use biore’s charcoal cleanser it’s really good
2755 2018-09-25 19:09:06 Honestly some pple have their edges pulled out and they never grow back. That’s the most sensitive and thinnest part of your hair. You try Wild growth oil?

2760 2018-09-25 19:08:37 Literally the worst. My daughter had it at 7 months and she was completely miserable. Soaking in oatmeal baths and following up with coconut oil seemed to help soothe her! Your poor girls 
2761 2018-09-25 19:08:32 Yay! We're No. 1! What does this mean? Not much, actually. We still import 40 percent of the oil we use. We can never drill our way to energy dominance. But we can lead the world in alternative-fuel and auto technology to wean ourselves off foreign oil. Just a thought.
2762 2018-09-25 19:08:25 Gold Prices were above last week's finish at $1200 per ounce today, holding in a tight range yet again as crude oil set fresh 4-year highs.
2763 2018-09-25 19:08:24 to the guy who tweeted reminding someone’s daughter to get an oil change-thank you.
2764 2018-09-25 19:08:22 Norm, please tell me those are baby carrots and not unhealthy snacks made of corn, cheese, oil, artificial coloring and salt.

You keep your baby carrots in a snack food bag, right?
2765 2018-09-25 19:08:20 Oil Prices shot to a four-year high, catapulted by imminent U.S. sanctions on Iranian crude exports and the apparent reluctance of OPEC and Russia to raise output to offset the potential hit to global supply.

2769 2018-09-25 19:07:57 Peanut butter with tons of nuts and oil on the top, it should be called 'DIY Peanut Butter'
2770 2018-09-25 19:07:55 What do Saudis do with so much of oil? It's cheap doesn't mean you can replace cooking oil with with petrol
2771 2018-09-25 19:07:53 soooo...   the only way oil industry profits rise is by getting tax rates so small..   

while the average workers tax rates ..jump with each bracket of earnings...
2772 2018-09-25 19:07:47 This will finish all the essential oil in seconds
2773 2018-09-25 19:07:47 Thought I lost my Bergamot essential oil but I found it 
2774 2018-09-25 19:07:41 there greasy n literally taste like oil, ma maw is a professional don’t worry
2775 2018-09-25 19:07:40 Haha! Holly failed to put oil in one of our Minis and killed the engine. So later when her Focus wouldn't start, she put more oil in and overfilled it!
2776 2018-09-25 19:07:38 Do you know how in love you would have to be, to think about making your cologne into a candle that turns into a body oil?! that some SUPER THOUGHTFUL stuff 
2777 2018-09-25 19:07:32 #AMER
confirmed a potentially commercial oil reservoir in the T and U sands.

the sands are both well developed with more than 10ft of net pay and offer reserves upside and potential bolt-on production

any production will mitigate the disappointment in the N sands
2778 2018-09-25 19:07:16 Please drop the destructive acquiring of palm oil

2780 2018-09-25 19:07:06 Two ways to effect change here.
One is by voting.
The other, leftists have virtually erased by taking down statues and rewriting history.
You can choose or choice will be made for you. 
Exercising first option is insurance against the second. #MAGA #VoteRed

2782 2018-09-25 19:06:51 As if the money is his money from oil well in Daura Katsina.

Is it not our money from oil wells in Biafra land?

That he is using to buy votes for 2019.

The only thing he can do to really impress Biafrans is to die!!
2783 2018-09-25 19:06:47 Oil continued its surge as Brent Crude closed in on 4-year highs reaching $82. Oil majors BP & Royal Dutch Shell helped the index higher as their share prices finally caught up with the price of oil.
2784 2018-09-25 19:06:46 Millionaires and corporations got a Tax cut that has added on to our national deficit faster than any other previous time. Oh Oil prices are through the roof. His Tariff's are destroying American farmers. But go on.
2785 2018-09-25 19:06:44 Why can u put “marvel mystery oil” on the gas and oil? That seems crazy to me.
2786 2018-09-25 19:06:40 With such DNA, you should be by now dancing a gigue, while eating a shawarma drowned in olive oil.
2787 2018-09-25 19:06:32 When it came out is irrelevant. 
He asked where they were not how much a barrel of oil sells for - which today's price is $81.28.
2788 2018-09-25 19:06:29 I can fix my breaks and change my oil lol I wouldn’t do anything else on my own shit or anyone else’s 
2789 2018-09-25 19:06:27 The Market Close- Oil prices rally to four-year high amid U.S.- Iran sanctions
2790 2018-09-25 19:06:15 This whole new generation of men can't even tell you where to pour their motor oil in at.. and here you are, hindered by a stereotype
2791 2018-09-25 19:06:15 yesterday i was thriving but today i spilled oil on my piano and i’m sAD
2792 2018-09-25 19:06:14 Who listens to Rouhani? I mean aren’t there riots in Iran bc the Ayatollah & Rouhani & Amadinajad squandered high oil prices & Obama leniency?
2793 2018-09-25 19:06:10 Rock N Roll, Mike! (if you can get your hands on some clove oil, it really does help a lot.) Sorry you are hurting! Hoping that you feel better soon!<3 Keep kicking those pedals, my friend. You are incredible and my cat Star's (RIP) favorite drummer! Peace!
2794 2018-09-25 19:06:07 You stole the gas, oil and gold, kill the children, you want to fight terrorism, they are the family of Assad and Iran, and victory for the devil are terrorists.
2795 2018-09-25 19:06:06 @Ritzcrackers Stop using unsustainable palm oil!
2796 2018-09-25 19:06:04 when my dad found out I had never touched the oil in my car he just about had a heart attack

2800 2018-09-25 19:05:31 I loved Regals popcorn when I worked there. Their secret was popping it in Coconut Oil with a big scoop of Butter Salt. Pro-Tip: Dump some Jalapeños and Jalapeño juice on top when it's done. Gives it an awesome kick.
2801 2018-09-25 19:05:26 y'all apple cider vinegar.... rinse with 1 part acv 3 parts water... after ya wash ya hair.. and it may need like an hour of fresh air after drying but i swear my hair is SO SOFT. helps with buildup and restoring the natural ph too. (may want to dilute it w an essential oil!)
2802 2018-09-25 19:05:23 Where is the palm oil?
2803 2018-09-25 19:05:14 Fighting reasonable regulation is not leading. Voluntary compliance is not sufficient. If it were, we would have the oil spills, the earthquakes, the pipeline emissions, or the accidents were have.
2804 2018-09-25 19:05:09 ...

so the tax rate on a 93 billion dollar industry is..  9%

while the average wage earner is..20%

oil earns $117,000 a minute.

takes me three years to earn tha equivalent...
2805 2018-09-25 19:05:08 You stole the gas, oil and gold, kill the children, you want to fight terrorism, they are the family of Assad and Iran, and victory for the devil are terrorists.
2806 2018-09-25 19:04:57 democracy my ass.
you misspelled "oil reserves"
2807 2018-09-25 19:04:54 It’ll work trust! I use lavender oil w/ jojoba on big bites and helps rid of the itch and gets rid of the bite over time
2808 2018-09-25 19:04:53 Nov.2018 se international market me crude oil ke dam me bhari uchhal aane wala hai, aisa Mera anuman hai. @RahulGandhi @faizanlari4 @MLArajeshSP
2809 2018-09-25 19:04:48 Compare our GDP with our population ,then u know we ain't a rich country .
And our population kips growing ,yet our revenue isn't increasing .
Diversity our source of revenue ,our leaders say NO .
It's oil or nothing ,that's why PMB sent NNPC 2 search 4 more oil in BORNO 
2810 2018-09-25 19:04:46 BOFA: significant EM oil demand destruction could follow if Brent crude oil spikes above $120/BBL. Wait a second: 120???
2811 2018-09-25 19:04:41 Nobody bakes cakes with olive oil on this programme. I freaking love using olive oil. #gbbo

2814 2018-09-25 19:04:36 Random life advice: never use two stroke oil and gasoline mix to ignite an indoor fireplace.

2816 2018-09-25 19:04:10 Ah yes, the UK.. only country where poor ol oil companies ‘struggle’ to make money from oil even though no one forced them to drill.  Unionists really trying that argument again?  Scotlabd unique in having the worthless kind of oil?  Jeez
2817 2018-09-25 19:04:08 Can easily be reconciled by acknowledging US IP downturn in 2015-16 was as bad as 1990 and 2001 recessions... acceleration with RoW and oil recovery was a "no brainer"
2818 2018-09-25 19:04:05 Then kill nafta refine our own oil and stop letting  refugees into Canada do you not realize  you are pissing off all of Canada
2819 2018-09-25 19:04:01 Russia will never do that. Germany is not an ex Warsaw Pact country or ex Soviet country. They were buying shit from their bosses in Moscow.
It’s all about money, and Russia needs it from Germany for their oil.
You are waiting for something that will never happen.
2820 2018-09-25 19:03:58 Mr @arunjaitley , I request you to leave the finance portfolio in the favor of India. You have been the worst FM of all times according to me. I see all sectors are now are collapsing. Dollar, oil are cyclical and but they were not factored when they were low and you are just...
2821 2018-09-25 19:03:44 That stuff is edible oil basically.
2822 2018-09-25 19:03:39 Na Palm oil joor
2823 2018-09-25 19:03:37 You would rather stay with fuel oil? Cuomo just implied the reason everyone is leaving NY is because of the weather. A little global warming might slow down the exodus.
2824 2018-09-25 19:03:36 Got my plates today getting my oil changed rn and getting my Ls tomorrow shit feel good I ain’t got lie

2828 2018-09-25 19:03:22 Anyone got any tips on stopping the spread of bacterial leaf spot?

Chucked away my lovely kentia palm which was infected all the way through & treated everything near it with neem oil. Don't want to use chemical fungicides - rather just buy new plants & start over.

2832 2018-09-25 19:03:05 I would think she’s not bright/ lacks prescience to get an oil change per the car’s manual.

I would think he’s disgusting / lives like an animal.

I also think him driving to Jiffy Lube every 90 days as a courtesy to her PALES in comparison to her cleaning his house daily.
2833 2018-09-25 19:03:04 SUCCESS!!!! Could have fried them a bit more but oil, knob of butter and garlic powder in a pan and they were lush!!!!
2834 2018-09-25 19:03:00 That's a robot that looks like it doesn't run on oil but purely on pumpkin spice.

It is a war longer & older than catholics v prots by centuries! Oil is the catalyst currently. US are terror.
2857 2018-09-25 19:00:31 Trump wants to cut healthcare for Americans, why would he give a whit about Venezuelans? 

They have oil, so there's that.

"According to John Kavanagh"

Those things are not facts, they're calling opinions/assertions.
2884 2018-09-25 18:58:21 Sorry for sounding like a facist, I'm sure there will be some health benefits of alkalin diet. I personally prefer a high protine, high fat (healthy ones), low card diet. Desi foods are not that bad either, they just need to get rid of them delicious naans and unhygienic oil
2885 2018-09-25 18:58:19 Also I’d suggest getting good quality oil too. Sprouts/Whole Foods usually got the goods
2886 2018-09-25 18:58:17 @POTUS About $80 a barrel to continue production. 
Build another hotel and stay out of the oil process.

2898 2018-09-25 18:57:40 Not so keen on possible inclusion of whale oil, but the ribbon seems to giving off a good measure of ink. Thanks for the offer of an alternative (so very kind!) but I have more recent ones in the drawer. I just wanted this one used and out the way.

2900 2018-09-25 18:57:35 It's @PepsiCo CEO @IndraNooyi's final week, but she still hasn't fixed Pepsi's #palmoil problem. I want her to save the #orangutans and leave a legacy free from #rainforest #deforestation & #workerabuse - by dropping palm oil villain @Indofood now!
2901 2018-09-25 18:57:35 He's made $15 million selling snake oil.
2902 2018-09-25 18:57:29 having a car all cool till you gotta do oil changes, renew plates & all that extra shit 
2903 2018-09-25 18:57:24 I have jojoba oil on everything
2904 2018-09-25 18:57:21 The US is a net energy exporter, and Venezuela’s oil industry is in total shambles. Stop being reductionist.
2905 2018-09-25 18:57:20 Why did my husband tell me I smell like “black girl, coconut oil & blessings” 
2906 2018-09-25 18:57:19 that was on the card anyway. as India said from November will buy zero oil from Iran.
2907 2018-09-25 18:57:14 Then pass me the Olive Oil 
2908 2018-09-25 18:57:02 Yeah scary things like increasing jobs and the GDP, de-nucularizing  North Korea and bringing back war heroes. What about the U.S. now being the largest oil and gas nation in the world? Now that last one should scare you as Trudeau has single handedly killed our oil program.
2909 2018-09-25 18:56:47 Shit and motor oil sandwiches could be a thing too.
2910 2018-09-25 18:56:39 @TheBai_ologist no can do, Baiju. But I hate truffles too. Keep those things off my plate, and the truffle oil- oh I hate! Gross, I don’t like the smell of dirty socks. Maybe it’s me, I’m just not as highly cultured!
2911 2018-09-25 18:56:31 Its not everyday that I agree with Trumps' point of views on various issues in the world, but today I must say that the controversial US pres is spot on on the OPEC countries robbing the world on the ever increasing oil prices @realDonaldTrump #OilPricesMustFall
2912 2018-09-25 18:56:29 Plain 100% myrrh oil is great. Also, folks with a vegan or vegetarian smell better. 
2913 2018-09-25 18:56:27 #UNGA18 meeting or not meeting doesn’t matter because #America and #Israel are up to ruined the Muslim world particularly the oil rich countries to get access to the Oil and #UNGA can’t do any thing because it’s in their pocket.

2914 2018-09-25 18:56:26 Could I use castor oil as a carrier?
2915 2018-09-25 18:56:19 Mirin, soy sauce and sesame oil.

2917 2018-09-25 18:56:10 Did you know that Pepsi has a palm oil problem? I want @IndraNooyi, the CEO of @PepsiCo to take responsibility for destroying #orangutans precious rainforest home and end her deals with dodgy #palmoil company @Indofood today!
2918 2018-09-25 18:56:09 #PalmOil is causing havoc to Indonesian forests & wildlife. @PepsiCo is fuelling this, through business partnership with one of the industry’s worst offenders @Indofood. RT to join me in calling on CEO @IndraNooyi to end Pepsi’s palm oil crimes
2919 2018-09-25 18:56:07 .@PepsiCo STILL profits from exploitation #palmoil in 2018.

Tell CEO @IndraNooyi to end her deals with palm oil villains @Indofood now!
2920 2018-09-25 18:56:01 One question I'd like to ask is this; How much did this administration peg the oil per barrel in the budget?

$25-$30, i think 

How much is the oil per barrel now?

$81 per barrel now.

We are doing about 1.6m barrels a day right?

What's the plan for the excess?
2921 2018-09-25 18:55:57 ...so $250 million a year..   is wha nu zeelundas will lose a year when we gut rid of oil xploration...

yeh..  see we spend 85 million a week on booze...

we spend 22 million on the one day of the melbourne cup

we also spend 153 million a year on toilet paper....
2922 2018-09-25 18:55:47 #Rouhani doesn’t care about #Iranian people. His regime has plundered #Iran’s national resources and #oil money! His regime is an occupier and despotic. They have looted the nation of #Iran. He is not a nationalist!
2923 2018-09-25 18:55:36 fun fact: I am 70% olive oil

2926 2018-09-25 18:55:10 No varnish involved!  Just the (linseed) oil of collective effort.
2927 2018-09-25 18:55:08 “Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.” Psalms 23:5 KJV
2928 2018-09-25 18:55:02 Sure Joe. Instead of the pipeline you are buying foreign oil
2929 2018-09-25 18:54:56 @RitzCrackers is one of the brands that are still buying dirty palm oil from rainforest destroyers! The first step to stop deforestation is to stop working with companies like Wilmar. #DropDirtyPalmOi

They just care about the Oil there
2933 2018-09-25 18:54:28 Why? Because Ehsan Khoman said so? Why should we place more value on this comment than the bearish oil comments? Thanks.

2937 2018-09-25 18:54:17 Another regime change because of Capitalist can’t have a Socialist Country doing well.  The Sanctions are what is causing the innocent to suffer not the Socialism.  I guess the fact they have the largest oil reserve in the World isn’t a factor either?
2938 2018-09-25 18:54:15 So why hasnt Matt Lauer, Bill Oreilly, Kavanaugh, Trump, Woody Allen, Charlie Sheen yet to be made examples of... Imma wait....
2939 2018-09-25 18:54:15 Me (to the guy): if I wanted an oil change, I would ask for an oil change. My car is idling roughly, and my mileage is going down; What I mean is, I would like to get a tune up.
2940 2018-09-25 18:54:14 Bowlers are interesting. Love the game, but complain about everything.

2944 2018-09-25 18:53:39 It's refreshing to finally see a leader with the guts to bet our future on oil.
2945 2018-09-25 18:53:38 The German delegation laughed at him when Trump commented about the Russian oil pipeline and their future dependence on Russia.  

That will come back to haunt the Germans.
2946 2018-09-25 18:53:20 Highlight of UNGA day 1 is Trump vs Rouhani ( with latter just winding up his address a while back) and in middle, Macron urging US to allow Iran to export oil.

2948 2018-09-25 18:52:55 The #rainforests are our planet’s beating heart & the #orangutans that swing in the trees of #Indonesia are one of its most precious creatures. Don’t let dirty #palmoil destroy this. I’m calling on @PepsiCo’s CEO @IndraNooyi to stop dealing with palm oil villain @Indofood

2954 2018-09-25 18:52:17 ... that is part of a comprehensive climate plan that includes a cap on oil sands emissions and a price on carbon.

Mind you, you need to fix your roof, buy a new padlock for security, pay wives allowance, school fees...
2968 2018-09-25 18:51:03 cedarwood is my favorite essential oil it helps in balancing the heart chakra and with all the love i love to give i need that
2969 2018-09-25 18:50:57 Washed my hair yesterday. Dumped non stick oil on top of my head and shirt today at work. 
2970 2018-09-25 18:50:56 Is everyone aware of how carbon fibre and resin is made? Burning stuff and made from oil? It just occurred to me that there's potentially a misunderstanding of the real environmental impact. Fine is we are looking at improvements but not if claiming more than that.
2971 2018-09-25 18:50:51 And with the oil money support more world terrorists.

3007 2018-09-25 18:46:19 That explains a lot. I seriously hate that they're trying to destroy our parks. I happen to like them because they make for good inspiration for drawing/painting. Last thing I want to do is paint a fucking oil rig in a canyon that looks post-apocalyptic.
3008 2018-09-25 18:46:09 Tea tree oil is  but if you don’t have that, rubbing alcohol. Anything like that will dry it out

3015 2018-09-25 18:45:12 Who determines the price of American OIL? If America sold our oil at 5 or 10 dollars under OPEC, we would destroy IRAN.

3030 2018-09-25 18:44:00 I am glad that I could make someones day better today by giving them some much needed cannabis oil for the pain relief and stomach issues. We have also given him some for another person that is fighting throat cancer. I hope you guys will have a better day today.
3031 2018-09-25 18:43:57 So over being ripped off for fuel. Greedy oil companies and way too much exise tax.
3032 2018-09-25 18:43:47 When she showed, early in 2017, how much undeveloped oil & gas reserves are in Russia and how the sanctions are keeping them from selling it, eye opening. It is what I use as context in a lot of this stuff going on since then.

3038 2018-09-25 18:43:29 Thanks Luke fascinating as ever. If EU now dealing directly with Iran does oil stop rising further? Difficult to see where this all ends, outside or being bad for $
3039 2018-09-25 18:43:23 Ok so theres the friend of mine that the gf refused to kiss without taking palm oil first, later overheard her on the phone reminding her bestie of the babaz instruction of taking palm oil, before the jazz reach her man, but then again, what do i know...
3040 2018-09-25 18:43:20 Eventually they will go to war with Israel along with Iran for their gas and oil.
3041 2018-09-25 18:43:08 I don't go clubbing anymore, so there is no way in my right mind I'm going to entertain, vibe or date any women that go clubbing. Oil and water don't mix.

3043 2018-09-25 18:42:57 @realDonaldTrump In what language, the Iranian regime would tell you more about the killing in Iran. Our people were massacred, then some dirty European countries support this regime. Iran's oil exports should reach zero by November, zero, zero, zero

3059 2018-09-25 18:42:11 After the Vice President left, we received information that some of the goods distributed by the Veep and his team were expired, I went round to verify and saw that the oil, though not all of it, was indeed expired  - Citi News' Latif Mahama  #CitiNewsroom

3067 2018-09-25 18:41:18 About 15 years ago I watched a documentary about an oil rig firefighter named Red Adair. Last night I casually dropped Adair’s name in a conversation with an old school oil rig worker. The guy stopped dead in his tracks: “How does a guy like you know Red Adair’s name?” Solid.
3068 2018-09-25 18:41:10 Don’t see that happening. My uncles been an oil industry for over 30 years and according to him and the things I know there is so much. It’s all a big scare to push towards something
3069 2018-09-25 18:41:07 . @senatorbrowne: #HB2154 puts the interests of the oil and gas lobby first and the interests of PA families last. Stand up to this extreme attack on health and the environment.
3070 2018-09-25 18:41:06 Your 100 percent right,fish oil is good for the heart but the amount of pills or should i say bottles of fish oil pills a person would have to consume to benefit is huge

3075 2018-09-25 18:40:38 Oh my days I asked that earlier..that was my thinking.
3076 2018-09-25 18:40:35 my car needs an oil change but i don’t have time 
3077 2018-09-25 18:40:32 So it's all about blood for oil on both sides. Of course.
3078 2018-09-25 18:40:24 Thank you past me for buying CBD oil 
3079 2018-09-25 18:40:22 We actually get very little of our oil from those countries. We get most of it from our own hemisphere. Mexico, Canada and Venezuela. And here. We are actually exporting more oil than taking in for the 1st time in more than 40 years. Winning!
3080 2018-09-25 18:40:21 @LastWeekTonight can you get the catheter cowboy to let mr. Turnip know about the greatest international plot to destabilize the u.s. economy... Chinese dogs smuggling Venezuelan oil across the us-mexico border in their anuses funded by Syria?

3082 2018-09-25 18:40:16 So come up with a plan to distabilise regions so that you can illegally steal from their oil production companies

3084 2018-09-25 18:40:12 It's so embarrassing to have a POTUS that's the laughingstock of the world. You obviously had no clue you were "addressing" a room full of really smart people... not a bunch of cultists that buy your snake oil.
3085 2018-09-25 18:40:10 . @SenatorAument: with federal health protections being attacked, now is the wrong time to roll back PA’s common sense oil and gas rules that protect PA families. VOTE NO on #HB2154
3086 2018-09-25 18:40:06 Endless oil story
3087 2018-09-25 18:39:59 There will be a need when the oil runs dry.
3088 2018-09-25 18:39:55 I put too much oil in my car now my shit smoking 
3089 2018-09-25 18:39:47 What’s an oil change? Did they not get the right oil in there the first time? Isn’t oil flammable? Sorry for the questions. I’m an EV owner.
3090 2018-09-25 18:39:36 Head gasket? Have you checked the oil?

3095 2018-09-25 18:39:05 I would make the pipeline to get oil to outside markets.  I would make a direct map and when anyone wanted to block it I would tell them the get x less federal dollars because they are hurting everyone.  Also I would suggest Shell and such to start a transition to renewables.

3102 2018-09-25 18:38:36 If only I could have used all this excessive oil my face produces in my hair then I would be saving a lot of money in hair products 
3103 2018-09-25 18:38:34 Socialism is why the drop in oil prices was so devastating. The market can respond much faster to something like that than one guy who thinks socialism is a viable financial system.

3115 2018-09-25 18:37:29 I’m anti partisan, but Rubio isn’t the party and overall sanctions on Russia, Iran, and Venezuela are bipartisan and also *happen* to be the biggest oil producing countries in the world.
3116 2018-09-25 18:37:27 Crazy to think that just one week ago I didn't know avocado cooking oil was a thing.
3117 2018-09-25 18:37:03 Just so Your followers know what Your concern is all about:

The proven oil reserves in Venezuela are recognized as the largest in the world, totaling 297 billion barrels (4.72×1010 m3) as of 1 January 2014. ... OPEC said that Saudi Arabia's reserves stood at 265 billion barrels.
3118 2018-09-25 18:37:02 Shell has caused so much destruction in oil rich Nigeria, absolutely criminal. @JustinTrudeau shouldn’t give Shell a licence to operate in Canada.
3119 2018-09-25 18:36:59 But that is naive. We are still shipping oil, just by rail car now. Which has a greater potential for disaster? Think Lac Megantic. World demand is increasing. This pipeline will get built, politics just needs to play out. Humans arent going to go backwards.
3120 2018-09-25 18:36:58 I wish there was more reporting on the trump regime and Iran. What's really going on here? do they want war? regime change? oil? there's something happening that we don't know about

3149 2018-09-25 18:34:56 That first picture looks like an oil painting
3150 2018-09-25 18:34:54 Germany will turn around and has been investing in clean energy, so their trying to break free of oil.

3153 2018-09-25 18:34:52 Yeah the power of oil
3154 2018-09-25 18:34:46 Lets remember that 43 First Nations approved pipeline. Those in opposition are not affected by it all and yet they are calling for its end. Best ethical oil comes from Canada yet Government continues to buy unethical oil. What is Liberal agenda?

3165 2018-09-25 18:34:03 NB is in a financial mess and would be far worse off if they did not have the revenue from their oil sector, in order for the libs to survive they need to get the resource sector hating greens to back them up. Hopefully the PC’s get the PA’s support and this doesn’t happen.
3166 2018-09-25 18:34:02 I have heating  it wasn't the boiler. I'd run out oil, like the #DomesticFuckwit that I am.

3173 2018-09-25 18:33:37 Report you were lingering around home plate at the Stadium last Saturday night with an oil can. Trying to trip up Didi before he could hit 30 home runs. If anyone has a picture please post on twitter.
3174 2018-09-25 18:33:32 Nice!

The way I've thought of using illusions for my illusionist:
- running away, crossing the door and creating an illusion of another door close to buy time and escape.
- area effects like pits of oil to slow pursuers.
- cast "fireball" or spells to affect morale.
3175 2018-09-25 18:33:28 An out and out charlatan !! Snake oil salesman.
3176 2018-09-25 18:33:20 Wallis International is excited to be looking for a HSE Director for an operating oil company in Nigeria. This is an expat role, with a salary of 100,000 USD. interviews next week with a view to hire early Oct. @WallisInternat1 - @hse @TheLagosOilClub

3178 2018-09-25 18:33:18 @RitzCrackers is one of the brands that are still buying dirty palm oil from rainforest destroyers! The first step to stop deforestation is to stop working with companies like Wilmar. #DropDirtyPalmOi
3179 2018-09-25 18:33:18 Commendable! 
Maám Please take notice of oil/Land/Ration Mafias operating in town, Due to the nature of their business they have made life miserable for people around them. Illegal Weapons, Musclemen around. They make a developing City look like a Bollywood Terrorized Village.

3181 2018-09-25 18:33:08 Did you know that Pepsi has a palm oil problem? I want @IndraNooyi, the CEO of @PepsiCo to take responsibility for destroying #orangutans precious rainforest home and end her deals with dodgy #palmoil company @Indofood today!

3188 2018-09-25 18:32:20 @Ritzcrackers stop using palm oil and wiping out rain forests with their flora and faun
Fresh air and rainforest comes well before profit
3189 2018-09-25 18:32:20 Hopefully Olbas Oil alright xx
3190 2018-09-25 18:32:11 The German laughter was after that the camera cuts to the Germans after he insults them for using Russian oil.
3191 2018-09-25 18:32:08 Can't believe @Ritzcrackers is one of palm oil company #Wilmar 's biggest clients. Wilmar clearcuts Indonesian rainforests and threatens their inhabitants including people. Could change the recipe instead #destructioncompany #PalmOil
3192 2018-09-25 18:32:08 But have you ever cheated too
3193 2018-09-25 18:32:03 Sounds wise. With the advent of fracking, methane could show up anywhere there's oil extraction.
3194 2018-09-25 18:31:53  oil? To twetwe eh

They weren't talking about lubes. 

3199 2018-09-25 18:31:32 LOL
Is that why he was just begging OPEC to lower oil prices?
3200 2018-09-25 18:31:23 Hmm, thinking I should create some small rules additions/modifications to some Board games before trying to fully design one myself. Currently thinking about adding an Oil mechanic to Axis and Allies to simulate how crucial that resource was to the war.  Thoughts?

3202 2018-09-25 18:31:13 Go and buy the oil 
3203 2018-09-25 18:31:09 People’s BFs are drinking palm oil at 1am 
3204 2018-09-25 18:31:08 And then use the oil money to spread terror across the world. #NonStarter
3205 2018-09-25 18:31:08 Does this product contain Palm Oil ? I need to know weather or not I am helping to destroy the Rain Forest.
3206 2018-09-25 18:31:05 I’ve had my car for over 3 years and still have not paid for an oil change :,) I got about 15 more coupons left  life’s good lol
3207 2018-09-25 18:31:05 He has to do this before he starts selling oil from the US national reserve stocks. These are no longer needed since US produces a lot of oil now. A lot of money can be returned to US Treasury to reduce debt if this oil is sold off at current prices.
3208 2018-09-25 18:31:02 Wow, my country (Norway) was part of that war, bombing Libya.

And we did it because Gaddafi tried to create a pan-African gold backed currency and use that gold Dinar in oil trade.

The currency would compete with USD for oil trade and the french franc as african money.

Insane.
3209 2018-09-25 18:30:57 We get very little oil from the middle east.  Most of our oil is sourced domestically or from Canada and Mexico.  He's an idiot.
3210 2018-09-25 18:30:56 They have put more children in cages, separate more families, only country not to enforce climate change, created more environmental risks by pulling back oil and gas drilling restrictions...

3214 2018-09-25 18:30:35 @CoastalHyundai An hour and a half for an oil change?!?!  That’s ridiculous!!  And that’s with an appointment.
3215 2018-09-25 18:30:33 Have you tried putting a small amount of coconut oil into his food everyday?

3217 2018-09-25 18:30:25 How much of that was then packaged/processed & sold on? I'm always amazed at how much whisky England exports every year, considering you don't really produce any. So where are you going to get your oil, gas and electricity? If we stopped supplying you the EU wouldn't need Russia.
3218 2018-09-25 18:30:24 Soo I have an oil change tomorrow on blackstone at 8:30am who’s trying to come & hangout with me until it’s done
3219 2018-09-25 18:30:19 What?! @PepsiCo STILL profits from exploitation #palmoil? Tell CEO @IndraNooyi to end her deals with palm oil villains @Indofood now
3220 2018-09-25 18:30:19 The Right Wing helps out Venezuela with higher oil prices, and of course, his partners in crime, the Saudis, and Russians!
3221 2018-09-25 18:30:17 He could EASILY mess with OPEC by banning refined product and crude oil exports (out of the US) in order to let inventories rise again, but that would kill revenue; so he wants OPEC to do something instead. Easy to blame them when Americans hate OPEC after the 1970’s oil embargo.
3222 2018-09-25 18:30:16 Like a vampire, he drinks oil out of robots.
3223 2018-09-25 18:30:05 But it IS UK oil.
3224 2018-09-25 18:29:59 Oh yes. The OPEC oil racket is one of the most ludicrous & dangerous alliances out there. While SA funds the worse of the Wahhabists, made up most of 9/11 whackos, & uses our weapons and cholera to kill millions in Yemen, we are 100% ok as long as u exchange in US currency.
3225 2018-09-25 18:29:54 This guy didn't even get to the point of cooking anything, he put the oil in a pan on the stove, turned it on, and then went in his basement and played on his Playstation for 15 minutes until the smoke started to get into the basement
3226 2018-09-25 18:29:53 Thanks #openreach for ploughing up grass verge and leaking oil all over path alongside my home whilst doing whatever in one of the 3 boxes you have now along the roadside.....

3228 2018-09-25 18:29:41 not to be controversial but i just read something about Cosby. he was good friends with the CEO of one of the worlds largest oil companies who is NOTORIOUS for paying off US officials (senators, judges etc) now im just saying uknow could be nothing but ionno seems suspicious
3229 2018-09-25 18:29:38 Coconut oil. I warm it up and put it all though my hair and let it sit over night every few nights and my hair is always soft and shiney when I wake up and it helped my hair grow like 3 inches
3230 2018-09-25 18:29:37 As the US is an oil exporter why would it want lower prices?
3231 2018-09-25 18:29:35 Man sitting here at express oil change getting an ambulance repaired
3232 2018-09-25 18:29:33 President #Trump should be ashamed of himself to criticize Germany for their dealings with Russia. He only wants us to buy the cheap US Oil that was created by the Fracking. It’s disrespectful to use the stage of the United Nations to criticize a partner. #UNGA #UnitedNations

3234 2018-09-25 18:29:27 I’m not being harsh, Scott. I’m not demeaning anyone. It’s what most of the evangelical seminaries and churches teach. I’m trying to warn people it’s not true. Many will apostatize (Mt 24:10-12, 23-26). I want people to overcome (Mt 24:13)—to be wise virgins with enough oil.

It may become true when we are intergalactic species. but to replace oil. mehh..
3239 2018-09-25 18:29:01 Even if Oklahoma has its cons, they do have 10 minute oil changes and let me tell you, life changing. Never left my car!
3240 2018-09-25 18:28:56 I gotta go get my oil changed ugh

3245 2018-09-25 18:28:30 The rest of the countries that signed the treaty said yesterday they will honor that agreement! So now the US must sanction our Allies for buying oil from Iran... Lmao what a dumb pucker!
3246 2018-09-25 18:27:57 Of course they did. Why do we have oil, gas, and coal? Massive die offs. From what cause, pray tell? We're not completely certain of the root cause but we've seen evidence of enormous CO2 loads in Earth's atmosphere that correspond to die offs. Uh huh.
3247 2018-09-25 18:27:55 When I worked at a petrochemical plant and in and oil/gas services R&D lab, I wore jeans or casual. For office, I prefer business casual with at least option to wear jeans on Friday. Being comfortably dressed affects my productivity.   #AskSWE

3249 2018-09-25 18:27:46 Image in 45 years and oil runs out and NZ has done nothing to adapt. Many are sick of the planet and resources been raped for short term gain. What will great grandchildren do when after you have wasted it all.
3250 2018-09-25 18:27:42 As Dick-head Cheny said - god didn't see fit to give the oil to friendly counties.

3282 2018-09-25 18:24:22 I know, but I'm not saying make Alaska a colony for the sake of the people living there, I'm saying make it a colony so that the Federal State can go back to testing nukes on it while fracking for oil.
3283 2018-09-25 18:24:21 Exactly. Hillary & Obama did a number on Syria & Libya to launch the global slave trade. 
They created the refugee crisis 
They armed Isis to take the oil through Turkey to Europe and bring in Terrorist.. what a difference 8yrs make. Thanks to the foundation Bush Clinton laid.

3294 2018-09-25 18:23:12 Let everyone buy oil in their own currency & see how you like that. 
#Petrodollar
3295 2018-09-25 18:23:06 $AMRN nothing new about what fish oil can do for cardiac patients. Now they wanna sell it as a prescription. Bunch of crooks.
3296 2018-09-25 18:22:53 That first picture is like an oil painting - brava!
3297 2018-09-25 18:22:53 #PalmOil is causing havoc to Indonesian forests & wildlife. @PepsiCo is fuelling this, through business partnership with one of the industry’s worst offenders @Indofood. RT to join me in calling on CEO @IndraNooyi to end Pepsi’s palm oil crimes

3300 2018-09-25 18:22:23 It's @PepsiCo CEO @IndraNooyi's final week, but she still hasn't fixed Pepsi's #palmoil problem. I want her to save the #orangutans and leave a legacy free from #rainforest #deforestation & #workerabuse - by dropping palm oil villain @Indofood now!
3301 2018-09-25 18:22:15 The oil belongs to future generations.
3302 2018-09-25 18:22:09 Tuesday tips!

Eat healthy fats! These include omega 3 fats in wild fatty fish, as well as coconut oil, extra-virgin olive oil, avocados, whole eggs, nuts, and seeds.

3303 2018-09-25 18:22:05 My dad is a cool dude. He’s 77 and still gets on roofs, crawls under trailers, changes the oil and can fix most electrical things. I hope I have that much energy when I’m 77.
3304 2018-09-25 18:22:00 Sullivan helped the Bush regime invade a sovereign country that NEVER attacked us in order to steal their land and oil.
3305 2018-09-25 18:21:59 I performed the oil drop experiment
3306 2018-09-25 18:21:57 Funny but that won’t make oil any cheaper for them.
3307 2018-09-25 18:21:54 Βάζω κρέμες με tea oil aloe vera Και εκχυλίσματα λεβάντας
3308 2018-09-25 18:21:50 Right. Cause capitalism doesn't bring ANY misery like having to go bankrupt when you're sick, being thrown in jail so corporations can exploit your slave labor or destroying the earth so oil companies can make more profit. No misery AT ALL.
3309 2018-09-25 18:21:46 That's great keep up the good work I'll get myself the tissue oil heard it works wonders I'll post results soon
3310 2018-09-25 18:21:41 Just fucking great i need new tires and and a oil change
3311 2018-09-25 18:21:24 President @realDonaldTrump - It's horrible what he's done. He's a con man, he's a NYC street corner hustler three card monte. A classic con artists, selling snake oil. He doesn't believe himself, so he creates fake stories.
3312 2018-09-25 18:21:19 So we need more toppling of authoritarian regimes like Libya and Syria so we can have more failed states where terror reigns?  We should reassess our policy concerning oil since we soon will be #1 producer , is NATO still necessary, and what is our long term foreign policy
3313 2018-09-25 18:21:16 Make water work for you.  Contact us to inquire about converting your oil hydraulic system to one run on tap water.
3314 2018-09-25 18:21:16 Saudi Arabia has plenty oil.
3315 2018-09-25 18:21:11 Of course Washington is trying to throw more red tape as they dont want to loose their huge discount on Canadian oil that the sell back to us at huge profits FTM. FOLLOW THE MONEY   it's not about the environment dont see them complaining about American oil tankers hauling crude
3316 2018-09-25 18:21:11 Italian shorti untoasted with lettuce and onions, little bit of mayo, oil&vin, oregano, add pepperoni. Here's sea salt chips, cherry limeade.
3317 2018-09-25 18:21:10 To be sincere it can be established that most guys ask for sex in return for materialistic appeal from girls, this is the trend of our society.
3318 2018-09-25 18:20:57 Will OPEC listen and follow? Will the Oil Price head South??
High oil price is the biggest obstacle in the path of fight against poverty!
3319 2018-09-25 18:20:53 *pulls up to get an oil change*

“and don’t show me my air filter, my dad is going to change it.” 

Lmao I’m such a hard ass 
3320 2018-09-25 18:20:52 who will buy the fish oil co? I doubt the payors will agree such a high price - if they are smart they should immediately switch to OTC promote the recent data and avoid any struggle with the payors.
3321 2018-09-25 18:20:47 Haha! I took more CBD oil and that really helped. It just takes a few hours to kick in. But I’m on top of it now. No one was maimed today. Lucky them!
3322 2018-09-25 18:20:44 Edibles and oil changes do not mix
3323 2018-09-25 18:20:42 Where is Australias
We have more oil and gas than Norway, except its all foreign owned
3324 2018-09-25 18:20:42 You should invest in some Star of Bethlehem oil. We all use it for our panic attacks. They give it to soldiers with PTSD. Just two drops under your tongue when you feel it coming on. It's magic.
3325 2018-09-25 18:20:36 First, I never talked down to you. Second. I live in Alberta and I've seen the socialist devastation. Third. Most of the major oil companies have pulled out of Alberta due to the hostile environment.
3326 2018-09-25 18:20:20 Aajtak to water & oil bhi nahi mile  to ye kyaaaaa ....?
3327 2018-09-25 18:20:20 Why not? Did you see automaker/oil complex really try to address the issue until Tesla? Even a very small agreement like Paris is spit upon and disavowed in favor of coal mining. Where's progress? In this world of inertia it takes someone like Elon to make changes.
3328 2018-09-25 18:20:19 And that stops him from contributing to solutions how? All he knows how to do is point a finger and say 'its their falt'. No concept of econ, hr, time, or security. He's a snake oil salesman claiming his goods provide utopia and cure personal accountability. He can't do either.
3329 2018-09-25 18:20:16 I could cite myself for that ... but take a look at the tobacco settlement and tobacco taxes. States cashed in on the tax increases  and now are financially dependent on continued tobacco sales to pay  debt. Does Alaska, which pays oil royalties, have any incentive to end FF?

3331 2018-09-25 18:20:00 What?! @PepsiCo STILL profits from exploitation #palmoil? Tell CEO @IndraNooyi to end her deals with palm oil villains @Indofood now
3332 2018-09-25 18:20:00 oil rate should   come  down,  oil  engine should  covert to solar  or   battry power

3335 2018-09-25 18:19:51 If you honk at me 0.278 seconds after the light turns green I’m going to put my vehicle in park, adjust my seat, adjust my mirrors, check my tire pressure, check the oil level, return some emails, eat a snack, and check the forecast.
3336 2018-09-25 18:19:50 Look into AIPAC, big pharma, weapons contractors, and big oil. Believe me, those have a far bigger role in US politics than putin ever will. Putin's no saint; he's drowning in oligarchs, but that power doesn't really propagate into US soil.
3337 2018-09-25 18:19:40 Snake oil salesman.
3338 2018-09-25 18:19:40 Pepsi has a palm oil problem & its CEO @IndraNooyi has one week left at the helm, it’s time for her to end @PepsiCo’s deals with scandal-mired #palmoil business partner @Indofood
3339 2018-09-25 18:19:34 Kid you have to understand that our government has been bought and sold for decades. If not Russia, it was big oil, if not them then big tobacco, you have to evolve your mind to understand your place in time is unique...
3340 2018-09-25 18:19:27 PSA: Don’t get on this coconut oil bandwagon. I don’t think many people know that coconut oil is 90% saturated fat... that’s higher than regular butter. So much for being a “healthy” alternative.
3341 2018-09-25 18:19:23 I used to work in a fish and chip shop and we made deep fried Mars bars at Christmas. You can also deep fry ice cream if it's well frozen and the oil is hot enough.
3342 2018-09-25 18:19:22 Not only that can the FM @arunjaitley ever say that he has been effective in his decision to stop the falling rupee and rise in oil prices if the previous RBI Governor was so inefficient according to him. It is sheer boasting and beating his own drum with a hole.
3343 2018-09-25 18:19:16 Am I the only one who hates doing things that have to do with their car??? Bitch...... I’ve been waiting almost 3hr to get my damn oil changed

3358 2018-09-25 18:18:20 Did you know that patchouli essential oil helps to curb your appetite?
3359 2018-09-25 18:18:14 Red onions, baby plum tomatoes, fresh olives  partially fried with that mpiru and a dash of course ground black pepper with a sprinkle of olive oil makes a perfect salad. Red wine cheese garlic bread perfect summer meal. That’s a tip and it’s free. Thank me later 
3360 2018-09-25 18:18:10 Tell Ritz and other brands to cut off Wilmar, who they've been buying dirty palm oil from, for years.

3367 2018-09-25 18:17:29 Only way to do beetroot is to cut it into wedges, pour olive oil and a dash of runny honey on it. Season with S&P and sprinkle it with fresh Thyme. Toss it! Roast in oven until it’s all soft. There. That’s all you need to know! 
3368 2018-09-25 18:17:28 What he's saying is not totally wrong, it might be harsh ,but we all have crossed diff paths n met diff ppl,and our assertions are made from our individual experience, he might be right to a reasonable extent that girls materialistic tendencies make guys approach them for sex.

3371 2018-09-25 18:17:17 Iran. The greatest Muslim nation of the last 40 yrs. They beat the israelis in the 2005  war, beat isis. Never blamed sunni faith for destruction of their mosques Produced so many nuclear scientists. Saudis produced nothing despite all the oil and hajj money. Drunks and gamblers
3372 2018-09-25 18:17:16 Stir fry it with garlic, soy sauce, mushrooms, onions and peppers. Serve with a slice of garlic olive oil bread

Extreme hassle and complete runaround when my car ran out of oil? Priceless
But despite the company's recent £1 million giveaway, I will settle for £525.28. #DoTheRightThing

3378 2018-09-25 18:16:42 I'd like to see a fanbase Venn diagram of Evangelicals, WWE, Conservative Talk Radio and Snake Oil sales.
3379 2018-09-25 18:16:40 I got an oil change by my own accord on Sunday. Then I spent the day looking at home decorations and shopping for pillows for my new couch and chairs. Then I started dinner for tonight in my crock pot before leaving for work this morning. Is this adulting? I’m feeling very old.
3380 2018-09-25 18:16:33 @RitzCrackers is one of the brands that are still buying dirty palm oil from rainforest destroyers! The first step to stop deforestation is to stop working with companies like Wilmar. #DropDirtyPalmOi
3381 2018-09-25 18:16:17 Pretty sure the Irving family that  actually purchases the Saudi oil vote Conservative.

3385 2018-09-25 18:16:04 He certainly has a lot of bombast, but he hasn't done the snake oil thing yet. He provides what he says he will, but he makes a whole lot of noise in the process.
3386 2018-09-25 18:15:59 Saudis sell their oil in USD in exchange for US military protection. The US dollar is backed by the US military AND oil. People try to make moral arguments, but thats not the way of the world
3387 2018-09-25 18:15:55 I dont see anything wrong in both sexes soliciting financial assistance. I only see everything wrong with establishing a basis for fornication or sexual extortion on the part of the men through it!
3388 2018-09-25 18:15:54 Congrats to Tony, John, Donal and all the team at Providence for delivering a significant BR FO deal. Ireland's first commercial Oil field. A big week for the company and the energy industry in Ireland as a whole.
3389 2018-09-25 18:15:50 Putting the World in danger, for getting cheap oil, by Putting NUCLEAR POWER in hands of People that have no democracie ,  is IRRESPONSABLE, HOMBRE IS RIGTH IN MOVING THE US FROM THE IRÁN DEAL. Ayatolas run Irán state like europe in pre renasseance era, mom amie, Irresponsables.

3393 2018-09-25 18:15:23 Nothing quite like dabbing your own oil
3394 2018-09-25 18:15:18 Not sure "socialism" is exactly the problem as Norway has both socialist tendencies and oil.  

May be more of a "corrupt bastards clinging to power and refused to put competent people at helm of oil apparatus" problem.
3395 2018-09-25 18:15:10 Sticking your head in the sand..he is putting Trump first..the ppl who got him in the seat he was selected to..the issue with Iran for exp is about Russian oil markets ..all the China tariffs guess who is exempt
3396 2018-09-25 18:15:05 @Ritzcrackers it's time to listen to @GreenpeaceUK, to stop plundering the Indonesian rainforest and ditch palm oil.
3397 2018-09-25 18:15:00 .@SenatorMensch: #HB2154 puts the interests of the oil and gas lobby first and the interests of PA families last. Stand up to this extreme attack on health and the environment.
3398 2018-09-25 18:14:51 Oil exploration. Arms to Crimea. Stronger military. Killing Russians in Syria. Diplomat expulsions. Sanctions. Shaming Germany for using Russian oil.   Any of these pro Russian?
3399 2018-09-25 18:14:43 Look online for coupons. My dad found this coupon and I only paid 20$ for an oil change and they were like u can keep coming back with this coupon.
3400 2018-09-25 18:14:36 Domestic sellers need domestic manufacturers, India doesn't have such a huge source, for some commodities you'll have some dependency.
Then for oil exploration comes ecological factors such as hill drilling where it becomes risky so it depends.
3401 2018-09-25 18:14:33 finally got my oil changed....

3403 2018-09-25 18:14:27 31 Herbs Essential Oil... sounds goo to me.
3404 2018-09-25 18:14:24 You do know Iran once had a democracy, but when we didn't accept the regime in power, because God for it they where going to regulate their oil on their terms, we decided to overthrow their government. We placed the Sha in power. We were first to rig their system.
3405 2018-09-25 18:14:20 I can equally rattle through their defects: large-scale and unproductive state employment, almost total reliance on the vicissitudes of oil and  gas revenues, a puny private sector, corruption, and a weak civil  society that has not motivated its large youth population.

3411 2018-09-25 18:13:51 Valvoline just tried to charge me $85 for an oil change so I went to autozone got the same exact stuff for $30 and had Eli do it instead. Don't let these people fool you lol

3418 2018-09-25 18:13:36 Trump “We defend many of these nations for nothing, and then they take advantage of us by giving us high oil prices, not good. We want them to stop raising prices, we want them to start lowering prices.They must contribute substantially to military protection from now on.”

3423 2018-09-25 18:13:22 I think you'll find that speculative report came out prior to the erse dropping out the world oil price! Central Scotland is awash with coal but it is still lying there because it wasn't economically viable at the time. Economics of oil exploration and extraction is no different
3424 2018-09-25 18:13:13 Idk if you tried it shea moisture : manuka honey & mafura oil deep conditioner 
3425 2018-09-25 18:13:06 How u go dey compare us with very serious nations 
I remember when NOI as finance minister under GEJ asked us to save excess proceeds from oil money 4 the rainy days (Excess Crude Acct),the likes of Amaechi, Fashola ,and co took the govt 2 court and asked 4 d money 2 be shared
3426 2018-09-25 18:13:00 But I really find it so improper for a guy to ask a girl for money, but Ba tonon asiri Ba there are guys like course mates of my sisters that ask them for money ,and if they don't have they'll ask me or my mum n we give them to give d person cos d need is justified .
3427 2018-09-25 18:12:54 Or, better still, don't waste your money on fish oil. It's just yet more health fraud.
3428 2018-09-25 18:12:52 It certainly sounds terrible, but aren’t lots of ice creams custard-based? You’ve already got egg yolks in there, the addition of some oil and lemon doesn’t sound super crazy. But good god, why call it mayo?!
3429 2018-09-25 18:12:49 Efforts to stay focused today:
-coffee
-headphones
-meditation
-more coffee
-short walk
-essential oil diffuser 

I should have just taken a damn nap at lunch because my brain can’t brain today.

3433 2018-09-25 18:12:18 Haven’t people worked out that all the big oil companies are not British and certainly not Scottish. So drill away - but like all the big companies - ie Amazon et al all the profits go offshore. So drill if you want vote yes if you want - but you will only get the levies.
3434 2018-09-25 18:12:17 Does he shit money anytime he drinks palm oil?
3435 2018-09-25 18:12:14 Oil up nicely, Watch $YUMA for a pop
3436 2018-09-25 18:12:11 Stronger military. Increased oil exploration. Arms to Crimea. Killing Russians in Syria. Sanctions. Diplomat expulsions. Shaming Germany for using Russian pipeline. Any of these pro Russia?
3437 2018-09-25 18:12:08 Screw you. America will set the oil prices based on domestic pricing and sink the whole thing. Ask May about Steele. The UN just got it's goodbye Irene memo and has to accept 25% of what we've been paying for their "Peacekeeping" missions. Socialism is a losing system!
3438 2018-09-25 18:12:05 Watching the action of Crude Oil futures. Brent making new weekly highs, WTI yet to confirm. If WTI does - will be most bullish for energy prices.

3440 2018-09-25 18:11:49 Pegula likes winning. When he bought the Sabres he said that if he wanted to make money he'd go drill another oil well and Gary Bettman just cringed standing next to him.
3441 2018-09-25 18:11:45 Yep. Roasting veggies is so easy and all you ever need is salt, pepper, and a little oil.
3442 2018-09-25 18:11:40 They are working to increase pollution , health side effects I even read roll back regulations on brakes for dangerous oil trucks .....quite the agenda the corporate dinosaurs have thought up to increase their profits

3552 2018-09-25 18:00:54 Now isn't that laughable. Where's your evidence for that? OPEC sets their prices artificially while our oil is sold at market price.
3553 2018-09-25 18:00:53 The best. Amazing deals on olive oil.
3554 2018-09-25 18:00:52 KG basin with oil reserves in AP's sea coast is emptied so fastly that people are complaining tat land beside this basin is shrinking!!

3567 2018-09-25 18:00:28 I bought a diffuser necklace and bracelet from Ebay, you just drop it on a pad and he holds it up and smells it.  With "calm the child" I put it in a plain roll on thing I bought and diluted it with carrier oil (coconut in my case). He rolled that on his arm.
3568 2018-09-25 18:00:26 Try eating spicier foods, work out at the start of the day... I’ve found that cardio has been an enormous waste of time. I trained to run like 10 miles a week for the Army but it wasn’t helping me lose weight. LIFT and push yourself. 

And use coconut oil to cook food! Big help!

3571 2018-09-25 18:00:15 Big Oil is spending $20 million fighting #yeson1631. Why? Simple-because they know that a vote for 1631 is a vote for spending LESS money on their polluting product. (Don’t’ expect them to be honest about that, though!)
3572 2018-09-25 18:00:10 Just found out that in addition to Thornton’s and Cadbury’s, Dove, and Colgate....Ritz are one of the biggest users of Palm Oil. There’s only 10% Indonesian rain forrest left due to this vile stuff, and hardly any Orangutans left!
NO MORE OF THESE FOR ME!

Mukesh Ambani led KG-D6 Oil&Gas offshore project is regarded as state of Art work in Deep sea and he had no prior knowledge in Oil Business.  Look at their history.

3593 2018-09-25 17:58:38 Oh, one more thing, I prefer the ones that aren't roll on.  If you get them roll on they are diluted w/a carrier oil.  If you get the straight on kind you can add it to a diffuser (which I've done) or we are using it now on a diffuser bracelet, cheap from Ebay.

3608 2018-09-25 17:57:10 Lizzy, definitely do not steal some of the dried chiles hanging from the trees in the town square or take them home and put them in a jar of olive oil, I would never do that

3618 2018-09-25 17:56:26 If big oil wants protection from climate change, they can shut down immediately.  That's the only way.
3619 2018-09-25 17:56:25 sis, black african soap every night followed by witch hazel. then tea tree oil on my problematic areas & grape seed oil to moisturize my skin since the soap can dry it out. TRYYY ITTTT 
3620 2018-09-25 17:56:23 Not surprising. Modi is a patented Trump puppet. if he had any brains at all, he would buy the cheap oil and spend the savings on building some public toilets so his citizens would not resort to open air defecation. #India #Iran

3635 2018-09-25 17:55:15 I work construction in the oil and gas industry, and from my standpoint alone I’ve seen more growth and action in the last year than I’ve seen in the last 8 under a liberal agenda. So if you’re not on trump’s team, then you’re surely not on mine.
3636 2018-09-25 17:55:11 Means you probably have a lot of dishes to do because your dumb mashed peanuts need to be mixed in with the 6” of oil sitting on top of them before it’s even edible

3644 2018-09-25 17:54:41 Just one thing... make these guys pay for the defense we provide, but leave the oil market alone.  It's a world market.  You can't blame OPEC for trying to get the best price possible for their only resource.  It's a free market, supply and demand and all that.
3645 2018-09-25 17:54:39 Nearly half the natural gas flowing through pipelines into Germany last year came from Russia. Germany relies on Russian exports as its main supply of gas and crude oil. Natural gas is the fuel where Germany’s proportion of imports from Russia is highest.
3646 2018-09-25 17:54:31 Should buy Bitcoins sir? I hear maybe it will partnership with Oil soon

3675 2018-09-25 17:51:57 Brent spreads have been a pretty reliable indicator of global oil market balance over last 25 years. OPEC+ should, arguably, be paying more attention to them.

3679 2018-09-25 17:51:46 I wish we put America first & become energy independent. Last look, the country’s daily consumption of oil is 18 million barrels a day. We produce ~ 10 million, importing the remainder, or 8 million. That’s 40% and That Is Not Energy Independent!
3680 2018-09-25 17:51:43 @realDonaldTrump and very heavy tariffs will be imposed on Europe. Get rid of the idea of ​​trade with Iran, because you will regret much. Oil and banking sanctions are exempted. No one doubts that US policy is changing the regime, by the people of Iran
3681 2018-09-25 17:51:40 It's @PepsiCo CEO @IndraNooyi's final week, but she still hasn't fixed Pepsi's #palmoil problem. I want her to save the #orangutans and leave a legacy free from #rainforest #deforestation & #workerabuse - by dropping palm oil villain @Indofood now!

3687 2018-09-25 17:50:27 Very presumptuous of an oil to refer to itself as “essential”

3690 2018-09-25 17:50:00 Basically, Germany has a budget surplus because the USA is paying for their military defence.

Yet their main ‘for’ the US is defending them from, they also massively help by buying their oil. 

Germany needs to be clear if it’s going to pay for its own defence or not
3691 2018-09-25 17:49:57 My life is so good that I feel like I deserve a junk food reward for getting an oil change like a big boy.
3692 2018-09-25 17:49:57 The #rainforests are our planet’s beating heart & the #orangutans that swing in the trees of #Indonesia are one of its most precious creatures. Don’t let dirty #palmoil destroy this. I’m calling on @PepsiCo’s CEO @IndraNooyi to stop dealing with palm oil villain @Indofood

You guys ask first! Btw! What do you even have to offer? Most of y’all even extort from us what we’ve worked hard +earned!

3703 2018-09-25 17:49:09 Great speech. It was Iranian economists trained at Oxford that guided Mao Zedong to market Socialism at the WTO after 9-11. And still we fight the portal of the opportunist Mulahs in Syria. A coup d'etat  in Venezuela surely would impact global oil prices and Cuba.
3704 2018-09-25 17:49:02 @Ritzcrackers Stop using palm oil which is destroying the habitat of the Orangutan. Use a local product. Be a good guy as well as supporting  American farmers.
3705 2018-09-25 17:48:41 Long term...there will always be a healthy demand for pilots in our ever growing aviation market. 
Though I doubt it will be a linear trend as a slowdown seems near due to the oil/₹ increase, overcapacity, etc.
3706 2018-09-25 17:48:23 @RitzCrackers is one of the brands that are still buying dirty palm oil from rainforest destroyers! The first step to stop deforestation is to stop working with companies like Wilmar. #DropDirtyPalmOi
3707 2018-09-25 17:48:23 The amount of pressure on #OPEC to boost production is pretty high right now. Eventually Russia will also comply, especially as President Trump continues to comment on the need for lower oil prices. Look for WTI to break $70 as soon as this story develops further. #OOTT $USO

3709 2018-09-25 17:48:13 "Canada’s shale drillers have also started to face widening differentials between the Canadian benchmark for light oil delivered at Edmonton and WTI, due to—unsurprisingly—insufficient pipeline infrastructure to transport the light oil to the market."

Sigh
3710 2018-09-25 17:47:53 It's not about falling oil prices but about what was done with the profits? You don't expect a nation to borrow immediately after an oil boom. Reserves depleted. Not to talk of added borrowing on top.

3713 2018-09-25 17:47:50 Oil is used to supplement the solar energy & they obtain $ from the govt. Very expensive.

3715 2018-09-25 17:47:37 To @PepsiCo CEO @IndraNooyi: Do the right thing & please cut ties with palm oil business partner @Indofood which has destroyed 10,000 hectares of protected rainforest in Indonesia! This disaster is killing thousands of orangutans and fueling climate change!
3716 2018-09-25 17:47:31 Did you know that Pepsi has a palm oil problem? I want @IndraNooyi, the CEO of @PepsiCo to take responsibility for destroying #orangutans precious rainforest home and end her deals with dodgy #palmoil company @Indofood today!

3721 2018-09-25 17:47:00 Why is this good news.  We should be weening ourselves off oil.  EVEN if you don't believe in climate change, oil is volatile on the market, dirty, cancerous, and dangerous to refine/store (Harvey last year).
3722 2018-09-25 17:46:58 so much oil... put vegeta on them or i'm sueing

3724 2018-09-25 17:46:56 It’s been awhile since I last enjoyed some quality Mary Jane. ('#MaryJane' is a candy manufactured by the New England Confectionery Company.)

What makes good Mary Jane so potent? Probably the soy lecithin, corn syrup, and partially hydrogenated vegetable oil that's in the candy.
3725 2018-09-25 17:46:56 na not for brkfst at least...all that oil and salt. i’d be sick.
3726 2018-09-25 17:46:53 Just went to @Valvoline to try one of these 15 min drive thru oil changes I’ve heard about on radio.
After ignoring me for 5 min guy comes out and says they’re “out of conventional oil” and “best he can do is $90”.
Currently at a no name gas station and happy.

3730 2018-09-25 17:46:31 It would certainly save on the boiling oil.
3731 2018-09-25 17:46:29 Your speech is regressive. “So called experts”, boasting about our supplies of “coal and oil” destroying our environment with no focus on renewables and new technologies for energy  “pulled out of human rights council” “protecting American culture” ????!!!!
3732 2018-09-25 17:46:10 I love receiving ignorant ad hominems from neo-atheists.  

Are u saying that the concept of a reptile morphing into a mammal is what create(s/d) crude oil?  Are you saying that a Saudi sheik digging in his backyard one day struck oil b/c of evolution?  

Nick u r quite confused

3744 2018-09-25 17:45:27 @realDonaldTrump .. to set prices.  Too many alternative suppliers who are willing to undercut OPEC prices to get business.   Again OPEC affects prices SOLELY due to how much oil they sell to the world market.  And 2M barrels a day more than what they now produce will not happen
3745 2018-09-25 17:45:17 Growth oil. Not the little cheap ones with a million ingredients. Get the kind that only has essential oils in the ingredients on the back.

3763 2018-09-25 17:43:48 Bro you cannot determine in 30 days. Moreover PMLN policies sucked. See dollar rate. Dollar was kept artificially low. This led to increased  inflation in last FY. Oil prices are also going up. PMLN were blessed, at one point of time they were $30/ barrel.

3776 2018-09-25 17:42:53 @realDonaldTrump It will be difficult perhaps VERY DIFFICULT for OPEC to raise 2M more barrels a day to replace oil that is not coming from other nations.  Their ability to affect pricing is limited to solely how much oil they sell to the global market.  They no longer have the

3813 2018-09-25 17:40:14 Depends - some of the commercial ones made from coconut oil can be quite high in fat and calories. It's certainly a myth that vegan food is always healthy! But even a vegan needs their junk food from time to time.

3923 2018-09-25 17:32:35 Oil is involved in every step of everything.  From manufacturing the equipment to harvest raw earth materials, to transporting those materials to manufacturing facilities that use energy to create the products, then to shipping them off to a retail store, and eventually home.
3924 2018-09-25 17:32:35 Well then. No more burning barrels of oil for decor.

3955 2018-09-25 17:30:06 as oil price rises profits do too for Americorp , more so when the world is tied to the oil dollar. After Scots indy , if we want stable prices for the short time we would be able to use oil , then it has to be sold in the new scots pound.

3967 2018-09-25 17:29:24 She's got my attention. Cannabis oil is an amazing medicine. It helps many ailments physically and mentally with little to no side effects. Especially CBD oil. As a disabled veteran, cannabis oil helps me tremendously.

3977 2018-09-25 17:28:36 For the US to be energy independent we must transition to renewable energy. Because you can't make new oil.
3978 2018-09-25 17:28:24 She’s just saying that. Trump has her by the boots on this one. He gave her a huge oil deal.

4006 2018-09-25 17:26:32 Yeah true, I just don't think most owners actually *use* that capability. Like you're never going to see a broken lawnmower leaking oil sitting in the bed of an 80 grand truck.

4013 2018-09-25 17:26:02 OPEC is pretty much toothless beyond an ability to initiate temporary price shocks. The original Arab Oil Embargo failed, & so has OPEC efforts to control supply & pricing. They constantly cheat each other. As the US & other producers ramp it up, OPEC influence declines
4014 2018-09-25 17:25:55 Dear @IndraNooyi I heard about Pepsi’s palm oil problem and I really hope that you’ll cut ties with @Indofood in your final week as CEO. I love #orangutans and our #rainforests too. Don’t let them die for cheap #palmoil

4070 2018-09-25 17:21:41 well, the heat and the red colour are supposed to be beneficial. I try to get heat through jalfrezi usually but i'm putting all the breathing foods in a salad now .. spinach,avocado,beetroot, tom's, cress etc .. bit of olive oil too. 
4071 2018-09-25 17:21:36 Same reason you don’t get an oil change
4072 2018-09-25 17:21:34 I did not hear this part. But they laughed twice. Once he claimed about his admin achieving in 2 years more than all other previous admins, and OPEC ripping off countries on oil prices! He really is a joker.
4073 2018-09-25 17:21:14 Oh, hallelujah. Wouldn't it be... WON'T it be grand when all of the other stupid decisions that this WH have made are subsequently overturned!!
You know like those pesky oil & gas leases that allows companies to drill in State Parks: Yellowstone, Bears Ears, Chaco Canyon. 
4074 2018-09-25 17:21:08 The Military implements the will of the 1%! The elites exploit the 99% to implement their will on the international stage! America’s conflicts are connected to OIL & fighting #Israel battles! #Blackmen #Blackwomen #Venezuela #Syria #Iran #Iraq #Egypt #Africa #Yemen #Somalia #Mali
4075 2018-09-25 17:20:53 Please do not pour someone's oil
4076 2018-09-25 17:20:52 OGX Argan Oil of Morocco, the extra penetrating oil. It’ll define and hydrate your curls.
4077 2018-09-25 17:20:41 I never watched bodyguard, however, I am not surprised drama was typically racist/anti Muslim.That is strategic plan of elite, break up, oppress, devalue, dehumanize Muslims; bombed, shot, gassed, starved, land oil, gas &minerals stolen. History revised genocide/refugees enforced
4078 2018-09-25 17:20:36 Groundnut oil
4079 2018-09-25 17:20:34 Did you see the German Delegation all laughing at him , when he said Germany was going to be dependent on Russian Oil . Germany aims to be using 100% renewable Energy by 2050 , I think .
4080 2018-09-25 17:20:27 Russia were mentioned.  The Baltic pipeline circumvents their dominance of the European oil supply.
4081 2018-09-25 17:20:26 Dear @IndraNooyi I heard about Pepsi’s palm oil problem and I really hope that you’ll cut ties with @Indofood in your final week as CEO. I love #orangutans and our #rainforests too. Don’t let them die for cheap #palmoil
4082 2018-09-25 17:20:20 Does it look like I'm in the mood to talk? Just change my oil please sir!
4083 2018-09-25 17:20:16 Since when has this administration ever cared about democracy? You just want the oil. Typical GOP.
4084 2018-09-25 17:20:07 Sounds like the Cannabis Oil is infiltrating the industry 
4085 2018-09-25 17:20:03 Yesterday was surprisingly a good day. I got my oil changed for free, I got to work with graham, and we wen to the Mart. Unfortunately I had to work with Mikayla too but I ignored her as much as possible so it was okay
4086 2018-09-25 17:19:49 Get your lovely perfume oil at affordable price, call me on 08161327943
4087 2018-09-25 17:19:44 Iran's #opec governor responds to Trump: "If you want OPEC to lower the price of oil, give a presidential order to Nimax to lower their WTI prices, because OPEC on that basis,  sell their oil. " #OOTT
4088 2018-09-25 17:19:41 Don't enable the oil capitalists

4090 2018-09-25 17:19:32 सही बात 125 करोड़ को oil & gas  पर tax लूट कर my god 
Petrol 90₹ india buying on 38₹

4094 2018-09-25 17:19:25 Oil can make the sponge wet. Hell, so could liquid salt if it were indestructible.
4095 2018-09-25 17:19:24 Milk cleanser itu pembersih make up, bentuknya krim milky gitu, fungsinya gak jauh beda sama cleansing oil, cleansing balm & micellar water. viva setauku bagus harganya juga murah
4096 2018-09-25 17:19:17 Palm oil keh? Esu leyi o 
4097 2018-09-25 17:19:15 What has palm oil in it?
4098 2018-09-25 17:19:14 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for nude horseback riding, and put some musk essential oil in my diffuser.
4099 2018-09-25 17:19:11 This is a actual reason why Muslim population is not grow or not
 successful years because they live on fast and do not accept truth in nearby when oil is finish in Middle East then is very dangerous for is population and his family

4108 2018-09-25 17:18:35 If crude oil price at 110 dollars per barrel, what next????
4109 2018-09-25 17:18:34 I never get tired of eating fish . Especially fried in some fresh oil w/ hot sauce & ketchup!

4111 2018-09-25 17:18:29 Russia isn't the only producer of oil. Russia is the most convenient supplier, but not the only one.
4112 2018-09-25 17:18:28 Great Speech !!!why doesn’t US releases extra oil into the market to break the Oil Lobby breakbone !!! Sir , Match your words with action and then see them waiting outside Whitehouse for appointment !!!
4113 2018-09-25 17:18:06 We've been letting #OPEC screw #Americans for decades in the name of #fairness.

4116 2018-09-25 17:17:56 U.S. oil safety regulators have thrown out Obama-era requirements for crude and ethanol trains to install advanced braking systems, citing an updated economic analysis.

4118 2018-09-25 17:17:51 Please stop buying dirty palm oil for your products from companies that are destroying rainforests such as Wilmar.
4119 2018-09-25 17:17:46 #PalmOil is causing havoc to Indonesian forests & wildlife. @PepsiCo is fuelling this, through business partnership with one of the industry’s worst offenders @Indofood. RT to join me in calling on CEO @IndraNooyi to end Pepsi’s palm oil crimes
4120 2018-09-25 17:17:38 President Trump on Tuesday preached the gospel of American energy independence during his address to the UN General Assembly — and once again slammed OPEC for the recent spike in the price of oil. WHILE DEMOCRATS COACH FALLING DOWN DRUNKS TO DESTROY DEFAME A GREAT MAN!

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
4125 2018-09-25 17:17:17 You mean free healthcare. Mine went up over 300% under Obama. Every politician takes money from big oil, nra, Monsanto. Anything to line their pockets and pad their bank accounts
4126 2018-09-25 17:17:14 KAWAII……(寝言
4127 2018-09-25 17:17:13 Are they saying that the oil industry is driven by increasing temperatures?  Only a society that considers air conditioning as basic a requirement as running water would dream that up!
4128 2018-09-25 17:17:08 Oil is $ 83 and still raising?!!
4129 2018-09-25 17:17:07 You mean *freshly baptized* baby smell, with the scent of chrism oil lingering, is the best smell of all smells ever smelled.

I know Catholic moms who didn't bathe their baby for days after their baptism just to keep that scent around.
4130 2018-09-25 17:17:06 Signed. Stop buying palm oil for   cooking or products containing palm oil.
4131 2018-09-25 17:16:47 if only they were used on illegal oil smuggling...
4132 2018-09-25 17:16:47 Sounds like a threat of bodily harm.
4133 2018-09-25 17:16:38 Imran Khan, btw, what is an Islamic welfare state？

4142 2018-09-25 17:16:09 This may be short lived due to rising oil prices and tariff whiplash.

4144 2018-09-25 17:16:08 Someone else is taking over! Trump wanted to alienate the U.S then he is succeeding! But we will pay the price for that at so many levels! Global Intelligence, economy, defense, trade, price of oil etc...
4145 2018-09-25 17:16:04 It was August only when we saw market climbed to new records despite rising oil prices and tumbling rupee. #optimistic#sensex#nifty - Bulls are coming back

4148 2018-09-25 17:15:48 I need to hear it....go get an oil change 
4149 2018-09-25 17:15:35 @SenTomlinson, #HB2154 puts the interests of the oil and gas lobby first and the interests of PA families last. Please stand up to this extreme attack on our children’s health and the environment.

4157 2018-09-25 17:14:49 Even rates going higher isn't helping the banks, nor the market in general at this point.  Usually that's a precursor for stronger growth/inflation expectations which helps equities.  Oil is having its drunk, last one out the party moment (will be lower by year end)
4158 2018-09-25 17:14:48 Don't but fuel from world oil ikate they'll pump air for you in your tank

4161 2018-09-25 17:14:31 YeahChip oil then
4162 2018-09-25 17:14:29  baby oil all the way. Throughout the night  
4163 2018-09-25 17:14:28 Pepsi profits from dirty palm oil. Unless CEO @IndraNooyi takes responsibility and ends @PepsiCo’s business deal with #palmoil offender @Indofood, Pepsi will continue to prop up the destruction of Indonesia’s #rainforests and #orangutans
4164 2018-09-25 17:14:28 I call this piece of art "bissexual culture" painted with oil paint
4165 2018-09-25 17:14:23 1- Before interpretation, maybe we need to perceive the facts... There is a continuous cargo connection between London and Mersina-Alexandrietta-Cyrpus... During the war... There is a operational British Oil factory in Mersina...During the war...
4166 2018-09-25 17:14:15 He needs low oil price until November. He coul sell now part of the strategic reserves. Time is on the side of OPEC, they will ask a higher price now to boost the output. His retoric makes things more difficult...
4167 2018-09-25 17:14:02 That bill should not be passed untill it is ammended. Oil is an important resource but it turns into a curse if it is not handled carefully
4168 2018-09-25 17:13:44 I bought on Saturday they are very ideal, the milk jars and oil jars are very nice too.

4171 2018-09-25 17:13:25 Let's not stop now ! @realDonaldTrump
@POTUS
@WhiteHouse 
Why stop? Please don't tell me Genie Oil is pushing our policy. 
Please,President Trump ! Stop playing games with these "gentlemen " who run afoul of our "original " constitution! The oil belongs to the Syrian nation.

4173 2018-09-25 17:13:20 Talley Oil looks like they just completed another run they are about 2/3 done with the bigger street.
4174 2018-09-25 17:13:05 Obama did it. It protected workers. Greater chance of oil spills.  Trump is an arrogant idiot and the man is devoid of brains and common sense.
4175 2018-09-25 17:13:05 I don't think whether or not a company is having an excessive Xmas parties is a very good way to determine a companies financial health. Even this summer I had oil companies tell me they scaled back their Stampede spending purely on optics.
4176 2018-09-25 17:13:04 why? $USOIL is heading up on weekly my target would be around $78ish. Or you are countertrading this bufoon from BP who sperged oil to the $100? ;)
4177 2018-09-25 17:12:59 When @realDonaldTrump was talking about allowing Iran to be a Terrorist state & allow them to have nuclear weapons. He was really talking about America. The establishment is looking for regime change there because of oil. #UNGA @jimmy_dore @RedactedTonight
4178 2018-09-25 17:12:55 Were Venezuela’s economic problems as a result of socialism or was it because of the severe economic sanctions on their oil industry by the US. Venezuela is an oil rich country. The US had a deliberately ongoing programme of undermining it.
4179 2018-09-25 17:12:50 .....oil prices, falling rupee, and many more about which this government has challenged the previous one on all these matters, with thumping chest but what is the scenario today only accusations and nothing else. Can’t even protect the falling rupee if they are so prudent. 2/2
4180 2018-09-25 17:12:45 You were just laughed at by the whole world, you cheap snake oil salesman.
4181 2018-09-25 17:12:43 Sometimes when I’m bored I think about when Christian gave me infused coconut oil so I made brownies and told Kayla to eat a big piece and it fuuuuuuuuucked her up

4203 2018-09-25 17:11:05 Trump accused #OPEC member countries of “ripping off” the rest of the world.

“We defend many of these nations for nothing and then they take advantage of us by giving us high oil prices. Not good...

4209 2018-09-25 17:10:32 He does realise that oil companies only joined in very late on (essentially followers rather than leaders)
4210 2018-09-25 17:10:26 Sensitization has reached threshold regarding Indian Supreme Court Judgements. The Media Trial of Aadhar made Citizens OIL their EYES & observe WHO is WHAT? #AadharVerdict wouldn't be a rude shocker. A humble addition to #Aadhaar, clump Orientation &earn Our Straight Blessings !
4211 2018-09-25 17:10:23 Yeah but is he telling the truth about wanting lower oil prices? American shale producers will go belly up from higher borrowing rates if oil prices don't spike.
4212 2018-09-25 17:10:19 Our favorite cardiothoracic surgeon and host of The Dr. Oz Show says coconut oil is a heart-healthy food. And the latest scientific literature backs up these claims, too. #coconutoil #HealthyFood #HealthMatters via @USANAinc
4213 2018-09-25 17:10:16 I get so frustrated bc my prof writes questions like “my dog has been keeping me up lately and I got my oil changed last week, explain the functions of working memory, the textbook is my favorite book, I’m on a new diet but I can’t wait for brunch this weekend with the girls”

4217 2018-09-25 17:09:48 The #rainforests are our planet’s beating heart & the #orangutans that swing in the trees of #Indonesia are one of its most precious creatures. Don’t let dirty #palmoil destroy this. I’m calling on @PepsiCo’s CEO @IndraNooyi to stop dealing with palm oil villain @Indofood
4218 2018-09-25 17:09:40 Dear @IndraNooyi I heard about Pepsi’s palm oil problem and I really hope that you’ll cut ties with @Indofood in your final week as CEO. I love #orangutans and our #rainforests too. Don’t let them die for cheap #palmoil

4220 2018-09-25 17:09:37 I wonder what the names of the oil and gas companies were? Haven’t looked yet, I stopped for a coffee while out shopping and just returned home.
4221 2018-09-25 17:09:24 The US finally, after years of trying, are about to steal Venezuelas' oil.

4225 2018-09-25 17:09:03 Sir what do you think about the bond prices. Still deflation or finally inflation is coming? Tariffs + fiscal stimulus + unemployment at its lowest + oil prices = inflation?
4226 2018-09-25 17:09:03 Unless that nation believes technology transfer is a reasonable condition for trade, or it's fine to coordinate production levels with other oil producers, in which case the rest of the world should apparently agree with the US in enforcing universally shared norms.

4237 2018-09-25 17:08:33 Ya they are working to build an economy that can get us away from the boom bust cycles that the tories ignored for 40 years. Or are we just all going to keep pretending the government controls oil prices and the tories save resource revenue?

4356 2018-09-25 16:59:53 @MelissaAFrancis Sweetie you need a lil Moroccan Oil & a Deep Condition in your hair. The frizz & dryness is outta control today on @OutnumberedFNC 
4357 2018-09-25 16:59:42 I object to this use. It's money citizens generate for non-oil related developments. Why not direct this cash to the non-oil related green projects? Why are we paying for innovations that the oil industry could jolly well pay for? Also why is their C tax cash returned to them?

4361 2018-09-25 16:59:23 I was looking into natural soap making - I was surprised to read that a large number of soap recipes contain palm oil! It is being used everywhere!

4367 2018-09-25 16:58:49 @Ritzcrackers But what are you doing about palm oil? When are you going to drop Wilmar, the dirtiest palm oil giant and single biggest threat to Indonesian rainforests?
4368 2018-09-25 16:58:44 I’m batting a nothing because you read zero. You underand zero. You say zero. Lot of zeros apply when talking about you.
4369 2018-09-25 16:58:44 Germany (Merkel) sold its soul to the devil when they traded their sovereignty for Russian oil and let in the terrorist migrants.
4370 2018-09-25 16:58:28 Also Trump approved of violating the Geneva convention and robbing Iraq of oil so anti-war? Lol ok. 

It was whitelash. This bullshit digging for excuses for Trump voters is affirming that you’re complicit in white supremacy and willing to side-step acknowledgement at any moment.
4371 2018-09-25 16:58:27 Finally a President that comes clean! We have known this since FDR sat on a US Naval ship and met with King Aziz in 1945. But no one wants to really talk about in our “free market” economy.  This policy of subsidizing Oil with the US military is why our foreign policy is a mess.

4391 2018-09-25 16:57:12 There's another way and not nearly as nice. Innovation to zero the American public demand for oil and keep the prices high for oil exports.

4394 2018-09-25 16:56:47 I’m not completely sure why. I think it has to do with the fact that it’s not technically flower or oil which are the only things allowed under the ACMPR... @_deepakanand ? @DanGooLay ?

4578 2018-09-25 16:43:39 You don’t think many NDP supporters are anti oil, pro socialism even further pro communism? Cause if you don’t think that you are blind. Fact is every party has fringe supporters.
4579 2018-09-25 16:43:38 Just got peppermint oil in my eyes again 
4580 2018-09-25 16:43:37 Laughable that statement, perhaps if there was no oil there the US would not be in the Middle East in the first place and not have led to millions dying in 
4581 2018-09-25 16:43:37 Discovery? Was always going to b ‘discovered’. Just needed the right time
Now Tories, Lab & LibDem have declared there’ll b no agreement from future WM gov for Scot to hold a binding ref. it’s safe to start announcing all those ‘new’ oil discoveries
Once oils gone we’ll get Indy.
4582 2018-09-25 16:43:33 Russia is now into BB's in Syria, meaning it's preparing to go to war with the US and Israel.  If we do Iran is going to tank the world economy. Forcing the matter into the UN, where the US has so many friends. If the US were oil rich we wouldn't be importing it.

4587 2018-09-25 16:43:24 "There are no killings directly from this regime" is the least true take one could ever possibly have. Especially after COINTELPRO acknowledged its assassination of Fred Hampton. Or after continued bombing of sovereign states in pursuit of oil or political capital.

4702 2018-09-25 16:36:23 #PalmOil is causing havoc to Indonesian forests & wildlife. @PepsiCo is fuelling this, through business partnership with one of the industry’s worst offenders @Indofood. RT to join me in calling on CEO @IndraNooyi to end Pepsi’s palm oil crimes

4707 2018-09-25 16:35:59 Oil prices wildin again.
4708 2018-09-25 16:35:59 @RitzCrackers is one of the brands that are still buying dirty palm oil from rainforest destroyers! The first step to stop deforestation is to stop working with companies like Wilmar. #DropDirtyPalmOi
4709 2018-09-25 16:35:56 Now, if I'd known that, I wouldn't have ordered so much oil! 
4710 2018-09-25 16:35:53 Yes! And coming into a "seasonally tight" period of the year for oil makes it worse.

4716 2018-09-25 16:35:42 i understand the struggle :( i use oil control face wash and scrubs which prevent it for a few hours, but even when i sit in an air conditioned room, the excess oil makes a comeback as though i've been ploughing fields.

BUT HOW CAN I BE THE PRETTIEST WHEN YOU EXIST? 
4717 2018-09-25 16:35:38 Pepsi profits from dirty palm oil. Unless CEO @IndraNooyi takes responsibility and ends @PepsiCo’s business deal with #palmoil offender @Indofood, Pepsi will continue to prop up the destruction of Indonesia’s #rainforests and #orangutans
4718 2018-09-25 16:35:33 So in Greece a few months ago, two women walked in the Byzantine museum and spilled oil everywhere, without anyone noticing.

4719 2018-09-25 16:35:29 Pepsi’s palm oil partner Indofood and associated companies have cleared 10,000 hectares of protected rainforest, destroying orangutan habitat and sounding the death knell for these magnificent great apes on the brink of extinction.

4720 2018-09-25 16:35:25 Yeah #Tesla is just doing a lot of good outside of trying to take down the oil industry. On a personal level this company and @elonmusk are giving me lots of motivation to constantly push my career forward.

4723 2018-09-25 16:35:09 Na vampire? my sister, the next oil will be the one from your veins.
4724 2018-09-25 16:35:05 Right now Iraq is the top supplier of oil to India. How does Iraq send it’s oil? I am sure this question is in line with the pay grade of all politicians in Canada.
4725 2018-09-25 16:35:04 “Additional sanctions will resume November 5 and more will follow. And we are working with countries that import Iranian crude oil to cut their purchases substantially.” Note: “substantially” not “zero”. Note: “more [sanctions] will follow” beyond Nov 5th sanctions.

4745 2018-09-25 16:33:07 If you can price energy in your own currency, EU can be "left in peace."  Iraq wanted to sell EU oil in EUR; Iran wants to sell oil in EUR; my bet is Putin will sell you gas in EUR.  Curiously, US opposes all 3, vehemently, preferring you buy (more expensive) US LNG & oil.

4750 2018-09-25 16:33:02 Many #Bitcoin neophytes are still labouring under the impression (given to them by wrong-headed mainstream articles) that the network will eventually consume too much power and collapse.

This is virtually the same as the flawed "peak oil" argument.
4751 2018-09-25 16:32:57 I must agree with how bad socialism is , just look at Venezuela , they have oil to get them so much wealth and yet there is no toilet paper in the super markets ! The same with Cuba , Bolivia , and Albania !!

4754 2018-09-25 16:32:43 You got something different, a laughing stock Bufoon in Chief. He caused the recent increase in oil prices by leaving the Iran deal for no reason and placing an embargo on thier oil. He spent his UN speech patting himself on the back while the world laughed in his face.

4758 2018-09-25 16:32:35 The massive growth in US crude production isn't benefiting the US citizen.

4759 2018-09-25 16:32:32 They are protecting themselves. They need oil.

4763 2018-09-25 16:32:13 BUT...there's a private understanding between the US & Saudi Arabia and underneath all the rhetoric, the U.S. sanctions on Iran both serve Saudi political objectives & financial ones. Saudi will pump & sell more oil as the opportunities arise.
4764 2018-09-25 16:32:12 Can we at least see pictures of the "World Class Oil Spill Response Team" ? Been waiting for quite awhile now.

4775 2018-09-25 16:31:44 Aggression? Iran elected a guy that wanted to redo trade deals, like #Trump. The oil deal with foreigners was unfair & they wanted some oil trade to benefit ppl, like Trump claims he wants for #USA. We then pushed a coup & installed dictator, the Shaw.

4826 2018-09-25 16:27:43 @RitzCrackers is one of the brands that are still buying dirty palm oil from rainforest destroyers! The first step to stop deforestation is to stop working with companies like Wilmar. #DropDirtyPalmOi
4827 2018-09-25 16:27:34 I guess so. Iran is one of the leading countries in oil production and now  Countries are forced not to buy from them.
4828 2018-09-25 16:27:32 Did you know that Pepsi has a palm oil problem? I want @IndraNooyi, the CEO of @PepsiCo to take responsibility for destroying #orangutans precious rainforest home and end her deals with dodgy #palmoil company @Indofood today!

4839 2018-09-25 16:27:05 The difficulty is, Norway has something the EU really needs. Oil, energy. Brit manufacturers will simply move to the EU, and the EU27 will be happy to have them - and their jobs. I can't see Norway being a serious option.

4841 2018-09-25 16:26:50 If oil & gas are only priced in USD when the US prints the $100-200T for US entitlements, then the price of energy & commodities for EU (in USD) will essentially hyperinflate & cause crises in the EU as EU industry becomes non-competitive (due to input costs.)
4842 2018-09-25 16:26:49 @Ritzcrackers Stop using palm oil in your crackers! You didn't use it 20 years ago and your crackers still tasted as good then.

4853 2018-09-25 16:26:06 The higher oil prices go, the bigger the incentives for renewable production. 

And the lesson of high prices will be remembered.
4854 2018-09-25 16:26:05 This is why I exited all my equity positions and redeemed some MFs. There is a storm coming with oil going high + election uncertainty. Add things like ILFS and market becomes absolute crazy as it happened on friday.

4870 2018-09-25 16:25:07 Dr Johnson said patriotism is the last resource of the scroundel. The USA should stop preaching and bullying and  start treating countries respectfully. Not only those with oil or nukes.
4871 2018-09-25 16:25:06 @POTUS Tax oil and gas exports heavily.  Force a surplus here to lower domestic prices.  Gain revenue.  Win/Win.   Stop pushing to deplete a strategic resource. China doesn't export rare earths
4872 2018-09-25 16:25:04 When USA invaded Iraq between 2003 - 2011 they didn't complain about oil prices which was over 120 USD Becuase they use to have IRAQ OIL for Free

4948 2018-09-25 16:19:26 Still unclear on what problem this solves. U.S. secondary sanctions target any company that acquires Iranian oil or transfers prohibited goods to Iran, regardless of payment channel.
4949 2018-09-25 16:19:24 You ship oil where you get the highest price.  At home to refine in other products or oversea where they can do it.  But the NDP doesn’t want any of it.

5001 2018-09-25 16:16:04 LOL, they won't let u. The entire micro economy built around oil will collapse. That's another intensive crisis we will have to deal with. Even Tata scrapped their EV/Compressed air driven vehicle n came out with Nano.
Alternative fuel will have to be phased in step by step.
5002 2018-09-25 16:15:56 Why the would we want to be at war with 1.8 billion people? Also we are people. We share one totally interdependent planet with rapidly dwindling resources. We're not going to crusade our way to stopping climate change or moving away from oil dependency.

5004 2018-09-25 16:15:55 Except you're wrong. We'd be happy to see all ties cut with the Saudis and our own oil refined in Canada and used in Canada rather than seeing it shipped overseas. You know, actually create jobs here.

5013 2018-09-25 16:15:36 Uh, NOPEC is a joke. We have zero authority to legislate them and are the subject of supply/demand economics. Only through the proper geo political policies do oil prices remain low coupled w increase in US supply.

5027 2018-09-25 16:14:42 Most actions in the ME come down to oil and control. In Syria it is why Russia is backing Assad; Iran has other motivations, the US is confused and France just feels guilty.

5047 2018-09-25 16:12:54 Seems weird. The big companies embracing green is definitely a sign of them leaving oil behind. It was only last year they claimed only that one deep well was available.

Vickie Marble is another and she has ethics charges against her. All related to O&G. Those who are “leading” oil and gas are simply not.

5105 2018-09-25 16:08:51 Except that the former is a price while the latter is a rate. The price of oil is not a stationary process. The latter is mean-reverting.

5115 2018-09-25 16:08:34 The country that laughed at him was Germany and Germany is buying more oil from Russia and is going to be dependent on Russia. If Russia hacked the election (which they did not), don't you think people that laughed at him for criticizing Russian influence over them are traitors?
5116 2018-09-25 16:08:28 A batter of gram flour, cumin, and black onion seeds, mixed with Pernod and a splash of chilli oil is awesome.  Any (savoury) food dipped in that and deep-fried is worth eating.

5135 2018-09-25 16:07:20 Your country is reach is good thing , but why you are making our country poor by sanctions on iran , who supply crude to us, and inturn increase the crude oil price which in turn increase our country’s current account deficit and depreciate our currency.

 Hi Lynn,

Today, a group of activists are occupying Wilmar's palm oil refinery in Indonesia. They're sending a message to the makers of products like Colgate, Dove and Ritz Crackers - stop buying palm oil from companies destroying rainforests.

5149 2018-09-25 16:06:42 @Dove  Every 25 seconds a football pitch of forest is lost in Indonesia - and Indigenous People, orangutans and the climate are losing out. A lot of this is because huge areas of forest are cleared to plant palm trees that produce palm oil. It doesn't have to be like this.

5156 2018-09-25 16:06:04 How about more jobs, higher wages, oil independence (which means we’re exporting more and more money for USA) North Korea denuclearization , consumer confidence is sky high, lowest unemployment in some 50 years. Now what exactly did Barack Husain do?

5170 2018-09-25 16:04:47 Just jawboning but then again there is no actual shortage of oil just a bunch of funds and HFT bidding up price and blanketing news sources with $100 narratives.He has real weapons which he can use to get the price down before the election-I would not bet against him using them

5191 2018-09-25 16:03:48 Dry it and freeze it is the plan, then thaw to use in cooking. We typically use a lot of garlic in our cooking without using garlic oil or the like but having to thaw out first will be a little annoying.

5212 2018-09-25 16:02:44 Why do pornstars get all oil up? Like head to toe covered in oil, how is that attractive and how the fuck are they not slipping around every where? That’s got to be an uncomfortable feeling too

5214 2018-09-25 16:02:37 imagine if Trumps floods the market with CHEAP oil
5215 2018-09-25 16:02:34 He says that because he benefitted from the meddling. Russia wants a weak globalist in charge. Trudeaus policies of anti oil anti pipeline anti resource benefit the Russian economy immensely.
5216 2018-09-25 16:02:32 thanks.  I own some shares in TIC, which is hopefully going to mine tailings for titanium.  there are other potentially high value elements to oil sands - so wondering if there is a niche market for refining, other than turning it into bunker c and other fuel.

5218 2018-09-25 16:02:12 * TRUMP SAYS WANTS OPEC NATIONS TO STOP RAISING PRICES
* TRUMP SAYS OPEC AND OPEC NATIONS ARE, AS USUAL, RIPPING OFF THE REST OF THE WORLD

Question: empty rhetoric or will the president ramp up pressure on Saudi Arabia and other GCC members to boost oil output?
5219 2018-09-25 16:02:08 You forgot fear monger and snake oil salesman
5220 2018-09-25 16:02:06 I appreciate it! I definitely want to be smart before I do something. I think a mobile method could be useful for me, as I suffer shame & embarassment talking about my issues in person, but at the same time I don’t wanna pay for some scam snake oil therapy on the internet.
5221 2018-09-25 16:02:05 #Trump stressed at #UNGA that #Germany will become totally dependent on #Russia-n #energy if it does not immediately change course. He also said that #OPEC and its members are as usual "ripping off the rest of the world". He has already blamed OPEC for higher oil prices before.

5228 2018-09-25 16:01:40 @Ritzcrackers Every 25 seconds a football pitch of forest is lost in Indonesia - and Indigenous People, orangutans and the climate are losing out. A lot of this is because huge areas of forest are cleared to plant palm trees that produce palm oil. It doesn't have to be like this

5290 2018-09-25 15:57:48 On a side note, it isn't Canadian's own oil. It's Alberta Oil, Saskatchewan Oil, and BC Oil. Provinces own the resource rights, not the federal government. Trudeau Sr tried to nationalize Alberta Oil, soviet style, and formed Petro-Canada. Turned out to be a disaster.

5304 2018-09-25 15:56:27 Oil is mostly traded in US dollars, which is not a problem for other oil countries because they can just use those dollars to buy stuff from the USA. But currently Iran can't do that, so they have to convert those dollars into rial to pay Iranians but there aren't enough $ 4that

5315 2018-09-25 15:55:48 Hmmm- not that long ago reports were for another 100 years of drilling. Also how much oil has not yet been found? It will run out one day of course- but in the meantime Scots could/should benefit. Pity the Lab party didn't nationalise from the off.

5323 2018-09-25 15:55:00 Yes very easy. Divert indigenously produced natural gas to IPPs and replace transport sectors with mostly railways. Resultant savings in oil consumption can bring import deficit down to zero digit. لیکن کرے گا کون؟
5324 2018-09-25 15:54:56 Pepsi profits from dirty palm oil. Unless CEO @IndraNooyi takes responsibility and ends @PepsiCo’s business deal with #palmoil offender @Indofood, Pepsi will continue to prop up the destruction of Indonesia’s #rainforests and #orangutans
5325 2018-09-25 15:54:52 That's  a different argument than I presented I agree  @calmecam , taxes are paid disproportionately by the wrong people. My argument is that when oil/gas prices go up the sale of escalades go down. Taxes  raise the cost of fuel in hopes of lowering consumption  you have control
5326 2018-09-25 15:54:47 @Ritzcrackers Wilmar, the palm oil giant, is destroying Indonesia's rainforests and  consequently orangutans, yet Ritz Crackers continue to buy palm oil from Wilmar; why, after promising to cut ties with deforestation?
5327 2018-09-25 15:54:46 Dear @IndraNooyi I heard about @PepsiCo 's palm oil problem and I really hope that you’ll cut ties with @Indofood in your final week as CEO. I love #orangutans and our #rainforests too. Don’t let them die for cheap #palmoil
5328 2018-09-25 15:54:40 They always oil my scalp it still just itch bad
5329 2018-09-25 15:54:37 Did you hear that Hussein Obama, in case you didn’t POTUS said in his UN speech,”RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISIM “ that you piece of oil sludge is a Man! That you ruiner of nations and people starting with your own, is The President of the US Donald J. Trump! Live with it! MAGA

5332 2018-09-25 15:54:16 Did anyone else catch Putin's speech at the UN this morning? He was complaining about Germany taking Russian oil; Americans would be happy to just have an American president!  And folks, Putin is so good you couldn't even seen his hand up the Puppet's nether side!

5333 2018-09-25 15:54:15 looks like he struck oil......lol
5334 2018-09-25 15:54:11 @RitzCrackers is one of the brands that are still buying dirty palm oil from rainforest destroyers! The first step to stop deforestation is to stop working with companies like Wilmar. #DropDirtyPalmOi
5335 2018-09-25 15:54:08 Again, it’s nice to be rich, produce a lot of oil with a small population. 

We fools over here have been giving our wealth away while smart Norwegians invested in themselves.
5336 2018-09-25 15:54:05 My first one itched really bad but what I did was oil my scalp before I put it in and my hasn’t been itching that bad

5340 2018-09-25 15:53:48 Yet Venezuela is one of the US's top providers of oil!  We imported 557,000 barrels of venezuelan oil last week. 1,712,000 barrels of oil in the month of August. If it weren't for the USA Maduro wouldn't be in power. #irony #Venezuela #UnitedNations #Trump #hypocrisy

5349 2018-09-25 15:53:25 America is not pushing for lower oil price, sanctions on Iran made oil price increase, donald trump is doing the classic doublespeak. He is doing the bidding of his saudi friend's, with renewed sanctions on iran oil price would increase tremendously in coming weeks
5350 2018-09-25 15:53:22 I guess somebody forgot that the US produces oil and higher prices are good for the economy. We don't want oil back at $30 and the higher prices create jobs.

5354 2018-09-25 15:53:12 Unlike you, I don’t profess to know everything about oil and gas exploration. So yeah, I am asking someone who knows more about it than me. That’s what adults do.

5435 2018-09-25 15:48:38 It's @PepsiCo CEO @IndraNooyi's final week, but she still hasn't fixed Pepsi's #palmoil problem. I want her to save the #orangutans and leave a legacy free from #rainforest #deforestation & #workerabuse - by dropping palm oil villain @Indofood now!
5436 2018-09-25 15:48:35 why is it when I come to get an oil change they wanna recommend everything under the sun. CHANGE MY OIL !!!!

5443 2018-09-25 15:47:53 @Ritzcrackers  stopped eating your stuff years ago...Palm Oil.. NoThank You.

5448 2018-09-25 15:47:25 A lot of enthusiast material involves sourcing and getting labor from way harder to picture stuff on your head, hence why there's no "Huh, suddenly there's less Olive Oil production from Palestine in 2014, have they suddenly stopped caring" piece on Eater or whatever.
5449 2018-09-25 15:47:22 I was very thankful for your support from the people of Iran. We did everything for you, I hope you understand us. We emphasize that Iran's oil exports should reach zero by November, this is vital for us and we will never retreat.
5450 2018-09-25 15:47:18 Was that because you don’t want to have to believe the truth - that Scotland gets its geographic share of oil revenue? Do you think it should get more than that? Why?
5451 2018-09-25 15:47:15 Check your Transmission oil this morning.
5452 2018-09-25 15:46:59 Some oil points of reference. Brent crude topped $82.50 bbl today for first time since November 12, 2014. USA Gas average of $2.855 gal is about 11.5cts gal shy of May 26, 2018 high. Last $3.00 gal national average was on Halloween 2014.
5453 2018-09-25 15:46:58 They burn on average 700 litres of heavy fuel oil an hour. And produce as much diesel pollution as 688 lorries running their engines
5454 2018-09-25 15:46:53 #PalmOil is causing havoc to Indonesian forests & wildlife. @PepsiCo is fuelling this, through business partnership with one of the industry’s worst offenders @Indofood. RT to join me in calling on CEO @IndraNooyi to end Pepsi’s palm oil crimes
5455 2018-09-25 15:46:50 I guess he forgot about all that sweet, sweet Saudi cash & oil. I almost hope they remind him publicly. #remindme to go solar.
5456 2018-09-25 15:46:38 It’s only our environment, what’s a little oil spilled. Should run an oil train thru Mar a lago
5457 2018-09-25 15:46:36 Except that one of the single largest recipient of Alberta Oil revenues, the Province of Quebec, via transfer payments mainly underwritten by Alberta, is actively sabotaging Alberta Oil, and the pipelines needed to bring this oil to market.
5458 2018-09-25 15:46:32 @IndraNooyi I heard about Pepsi’s palm oil problem and I really hope that you’ll cut ties with @Indofood in your final week as CEO. Please don’t let the rainforests die for cheap palmoil.
5459 2018-09-25 15:46:29 It's rather like thon unemployment figures. DWP massages them by sanctions, moving folk from Work to Support ESA or changing the definition by textbook. Oil n gas will only run out when it suits the narrative to block us from removing the shackles o' Westminster
5460 2018-09-25 15:46:18 And Obama allowed trafficking. Your point?
5461 2018-09-25 15:46:17 This reversal is just the latest example of the Trump admin undoing oil and gas safety and environmental regulations, coming just a week after the Interior Department axed a rule to curb the leaking of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from oil and gas drilling on public land.
5462 2018-09-25 15:46:13 @Ritzcrackers drop dirty palm oil and end forest destruction

5473 2018-09-25 15:45:49 Just so we're clear, there is no anti pipeline bill and the carbon tax doesn't affect the oil industry or all those tar sands in cali you guys scream about would have shut down.

5484 2018-09-25 15:44:45 #IraniansWantRegimeChange, Europe, especially France, Germany and England MUST stop support and help satanic Iran's regime. They support mullahs, because they get cheap oil and earn huge benefits of this dirty false friendship.
5485 2018-09-25 15:44:38 You're right, of course. I imagine after independence someone will commission an oil painting of him, but they'll cut you out of that as well. There's no justice.

5489 2018-09-25 15:44:27 Oil prices should go up and stay up with a weaker (less strong) dollar.  Insha'Allah
5490 2018-09-25 15:44:24 สีละมุนจังเลยข่ะะะ
5491 2018-09-25 15:44:24 Sir, another advise. I've 100 shares of Maruti Suzuki since a year. I bought it on SIP and average price would be 9000 apiece. What I foresee, owing to surging oil price, its sales may go down. Is it wise to keep it for long run.
5492 2018-09-25 15:44:21 currently melting in my chair because i had too much CBD oil
5493 2018-09-25 15:44:18 Me too! For the recipe, you take a large bunch of cilantro with the lime juice & olive oil & s& p & mush it all together for the dressing. Sometimes I fry up a tortilla & shape it as a bowl to make a version of a taco salad :)
5494 2018-09-25 15:44:17 So at last the oil price is moving upwards significantly due to supply concerns. Conventional large fields are in decline and exploration has been neglected for a few years.
5495 2018-09-25 15:44:15 #Trump: we are not going to choose the path of dominance, we want other countries to decide their own policy. 

Spends the next 30 mins lecturing Germany, Sweden, Iran, Venezuela, Iran, Russia and even OPEC on everything from socialism to oil prices.

5504 2018-09-25 15:43:57 Trump at #UNGA:
1. Rebukes OPEC on oil prices.
2. Hints at US supplies to counter oil scarcity.
3. Praises India on lifting millions out of poverty.
Music for India's ears!
Modi's diplomacy at work? Perhaps, this is the real oil price solution that the govt was hinting at.

5511 2018-09-25 15:43:36 A TV "chef" made giardiniera (pickled veggies). Sorry, "chef," but you do NOT need to add sugar or olive oil, to the pickling process (if desired, a mere drizzle of oil can be added at serving). . .

5522 2018-09-25 15:43:13 You had put on oil ?
5523 2018-09-25 15:43:09 Huh? US buys oil from Alberta at our price and then you sell it back to Ontario at a higher price.
5524 2018-09-25 15:43:05 Voters think he is cool and good looking but just remember if he gets in he will vote with Schumer and Pelosi. Higher taxes, government regulations including on oil and gas and liberal judges. It’s cool he wore a dress and was in a band but is this good for Texas?  Hell no
5525 2018-09-25 15:43:00 Keep in mind the end game is global hegemony. If Iran and Syria is weakened and conquered. The US controls the flow of oil and gas into Europe and bypasses Russia. Russia is the target, Iran is the stepping stone.

5529 2018-09-25 15:42:52 In Trump's statements at #UNGA I see a clear solution to India's petrol-diesel price woes. 
Looks like India is going to import US oil, at least for a portion of its needs. India could  even barter commodities for oil with the US.
Another Modi master solution!

5533 2018-09-25 15:42:42 @realDonaldTrump it will have a very negative effect on your popularity and will certainly not be a good result in the November election. We will never tolerate exemption from oil sanctions. I emphasize that the exemption in our oil embargo is our red line.
5534 2018-09-25 15:42:38 #UNGA : Trump is accusing Iran of "slaughter in Syria and Yemen" and the US has imposed additional nuclear sanctions set resume from 5th November and will include cutting down on buying crude oil in Iran. MDM
5535 2018-09-25 15:42:35 PLEASE stop buying palm oil from companies destroying rainforests - this is aimed at the makers of Colgate, Dove soap and Ritz Crackers!  There are other sources that don't destroy rainforests and wildlife habitat - USE THEM - cost should NOT be an issue!
5536 2018-09-25 15:42:34 #UNGA I wonder what Iran isn't giving Putin?

Or the U.S.?

Oil? Gold?

Probably just a distraction. They want a war with Iran to distract from business outside of Iran. 

Blah. Same ol' crap whatever it is

5538 2018-09-25 15:42:21 2 tablespoons of ground flax seeds daily. When you start getting a bit older, maybe some algae oil too.

5540 2018-09-25 15:42:18 @realDonaldTrump Iran's oil exports should be completely discontinued until November 4th, complete. If there is a waiver, our reaction will be very intense and you know that whenever you and I find a difference

5549 2018-09-25 15:41:45 The federal courts so far don't like Secy Zinke. They also dont like that he is privatizing public lands , selling oil cos leases to drill there.

5561 2018-09-25 15:41:03 Palm oil is the new corn syrup. Its in everything! I tasted ice cream recently w/ palm oil added and the palm oil gave its texture an icky kind of sticky feel that was marketed as "creamier" . It ruined the ice cream. Not to mention the rain forest. 
5562 2018-09-25 15:41:02 O.K. Did anyone hear Trump mention Russia except to slam Germany for   buying Russia oil instead of America or Saudi oil. No mention of   Russia/Syria ,Russia killing citizens in England and Ukraine.  Oh yea   let's not forget buy more military hardware from America.
5563 2018-09-25 15:40:50 Not sure if that will help NTOG as the higher oil has gone the lower NTOG's SP falls - 2018 lows today and Rosolanor gave the tweet a like? It all makes these shorting rumours seem possible...

5567 2018-09-25 15:40:46 Seemed like they all laughed..as usual sadly. Loved German delegates reaction to his comment about them and Russian oil. I think he was confused about where he was. He acted like he was at another maga rally. Twitter storm to begin shortly

5570 2018-09-25 15:40:35 So Trump claimed the US is against “encroachment of expansionist foreign powers” after basically telling Germany to stop buying Russian oil while plans are being made to expand NATO & build a US military base in Poland. Yes? #unga

It's good news but I insist, we should stop relying entirely on oil.

5580 2018-09-25 15:40:21 Raise oil prices on us? Seriously, that’s your beef? It’s called capitalism and the free market. I thought you people were all about that. What’s the weather like today in fantasyland?
5581 2018-09-25 15:40:11 No way really! That’s crazy and I’ve tried spicy foods, herbal teas, pineapple, castor oil, bouncing on yoga ball, swimming, curb walking, and breast pumping & got induced at the hospital it didn’t work it was voluntary tho not for medical reason so they just sent me home

5597 2018-09-25 15:39:02 but of course letting Canadian taxpayers become direct owners of their own oil production would be a terrible idea

5607 2018-09-25 15:38:24 I would be standing in line right behind you. Trump is right. No nation should be getting all their oil from one nation. It is obvious you will be beholden to that country.
5608 2018-09-25 15:38:12 Syria has less of an oil reserve that the UK. It ain't about the oil.
5609 2018-09-25 15:38:06 The mafia-cabal in the unelected ue leaders & thieves-from-all-humanity corrupt world government members are worried about losing their backroom 25% kickbacks from Iranian oil sales.    Support the impoverished Iranian people in removing their corrupt government. WWG1WGA

Up her for thinking down there for dancing pal...don’t kid a kidder 
5611 2018-09-25 15:38:03 I would take spoonfuls of coconut or olice oil. Even butter. Need to protect your esophagus. Oregano oil is pretty caustic on flesh. The best supplements blend it with other products to make more adaptable to the body.
5612 2018-09-25 15:37:57 Very bad thing to do. Recent major breaks in US pipelines have destroyed thousands of acres of land. Beware of oil and gas company assurances. They do not care about the environment or people. Just money.

5638 2018-09-25 15:36:49 Based on cruid oil price the cost of petrol should be 50rs/lt and in this govt gente the cruid oil price was such that the petrol price should have been 28rs/lt.
Either you have too much no 2 money or you are bhakt who cant understand this logic.
5639 2018-09-25 15:36:44 Went in for an oil change and turns out I need new tires, all four of them. What a scam!

5678 2018-09-25 15:34:54 #Trump seems to utterly overestimate the quality and value of this speech. It trash. I also laughed at the delusional rhetoric - also he says Venezuela  was richest country after just saying socialism failed it  so contradict. Also oil prices wrecked it   quack
5679 2018-09-25 15:34:50 it is the result of low oil prices for a period of two years,lower that 50 dollars for a barrel.
5680 2018-09-25 15:34:46 The #rainforests are our planet’s beating heart & the #orangutans that swing in the trees of #Indonesia are one of its most precious creatures. Don’t let dirty #palmoil destroy this. I’m calling on @PepsiCo’s CEO @IndraNooyi to stop dealing with palm oil villain @Indofood

5685 2018-09-25 15:34:31 I think @realDonaldTrump is a bit confused about the rise in the Oil price. He mentioned that OPEC  increases the oil price, but I think it is the sanction on Iran that reduces the oil supply into the market and hence rising the oil price. #UNGA
5686 2018-09-25 15:34:29 Since when Arab nations control oil prices globally EVER? 

Is Truml that ignorant!
5687 2018-09-25 15:34:27 Palm oil is murder, it kills orangutans. The issue staining @IndraNooyi’s legacy as CEO of Pepsi? Her ties to @Indofood, the condemned #palmoil company that destroys orangutan habitat and exploits its workers. @PepsiCo
5688 2018-09-25 15:34:23 Propylene is obtained during the refining of gasoline. So, good option for oil industry to swich and redirect fuel to the rocketry industry. On the roads only electric cars must be.

5691 2018-09-25 15:34:18 Quite likely. Anxiety and depression make pain worse. I have many patients who use CBD oil and find even rubbing it on affected areas improves. pain. Although I am not a fan of MJ - it has fewer side effects than opioids and is far less dangerous physically than alcohol. # pain
5692 2018-09-25 15:34:16 Did you know that Pepsi has a palm oil problem? I want @IndraNooyi, the CEO of @PepsiCo to take responsibility for destroying #orangutans precious rainforest home and end her deals with dodgy #palmoil company @Indofood today!
5693 2018-09-25 15:34:11 Things I picked from @realDonaldTrump address at #UNGA18:
1. America  will continue to reject globalization by embracing patriotism.
2. America will push for lower oil prices, boycotting OPEC. 
3. America will be tougher on immigration.
4. America will cut aids

5702 2018-09-25 15:33:34 There was no year crude oil was sold for 100/ barrel. Pls cross check your fact. Prices varies on daily bases. If you get a sales of 100, 100, 90, 80, 70, 60, 90, 100.. if you cal the average you can't 100 per month and you can't 100 per year...it is a simple maths

-Globalism is bad
-We reject those that interfere in the sovereignty of states
-But we reserve the right to force states to lower their oil prices, to change their leadership, to pay for our protection, to share our interests

5731 2018-09-25 15:31:41 Of course one could reasonably comment that price of oil is a function of demand. It’s perhaps a bit abstract for the president.

5778 2018-09-25 15:29:43 True. I expected 25 years ago that gas would decouple in a competitive market and to some extent this happened in the UK. But in Europe the persistence of some oil indexation has closed the gap and the market links mean the UK has been dragged back to oil orbit.

5797 2018-09-25 15:28:49 $200 oil change for a Porsche? Nigga must have the one engineered by the wright brothers

5806 2018-09-25 15:28:04 I agree . This is the only reason they build a factory here . The plan I guess it was to build a profit in 15 years down the road however Tesla throwed a battery on their works . In Europe will have even more success because is not oil dependent and lasts longer than an ice

5824 2018-09-25 15:26:55 @realDonaldTrump U have stated again about the US having an abundence of oil so why r oil prices so high?! Price gouging @ gas stations etc. is not controlled, famlies that heat with oil r losing your generous tax cut 2 it! Fuel prices @ truck stops filter down through r eco omy!
5825 2018-09-25 15:26:52 @realDonaldTrump YOU are a patriot & you also respect sovereignity of other nations! ...In that case #india needs #iranian oil & you shall not interfere! Q ...working out a peace deal with Iran by meeting its leadershp is advisable as done wit N.K ... Its high time now!
5826 2018-09-25 15:26:51 Remember the Shah of Iran.  Look at history, oil and where it began

5828 2018-09-25 15:26:49 Aurora, also with others, says it's seen a shift in demand to oil products, says you'll continue to see a shift to higher margin, derivative products globally. “We're going where the margin is,” CCO Cam Battley says.

How much does Iceland use? A small country in terms of population can't be that much of a deal. It has always been EU gangsterism.
5835 2018-09-25 15:26:32 .@realDonaldTrump @ #UNGA:#OPEC as usual ripping off rest of world.I dont like it&nobody should like it.We defend many of these nations for nothing&then they take advantage of us by giving us high oil prices.We want 'em start lowering price,not going to put up w/ it much longer
5836 2018-09-25 15:26:30 Lots of that oil money went to these guys @sonaliranade to protect the snake oil salesman
5837 2018-09-25 15:26:26 And local taxes have caused increase in prices throughout the county. My state has increased taxes by about .35 per gallon on top of the already gouged prices by American oil companies

5848 2018-09-25 15:25:43 trump just last week called for OPEC to drop oil prices which could devastate recent progress made in Iraq w trillions invested. Now he is going to further sanction Venezuela? What does trump not understand other than everything...everything regarding economics and world trade.

5852 2018-09-25 15:25:29 Oil prices are soaring, it has hit a 4yr high of over $81. However this will not be a topic of discussion. What they would rather discuss is how how PDP looted the treasury for 16yrs. APC are experts in propaganda
5853 2018-09-25 15:25:23 Total CEO says well positioned for IMO 2020 regulations #OOTT
- 60% of oil output is low sulfur.
- Refineries = high distillates output, minimal fuel oil.

5858 2018-09-25 15:25:13 They are trying to silence us.   The MSM, have been gagged, and bought.  It is up to us to keep reminding people, that governments can not go around plundering and killing. For Oil.  Or greed, or religion.  Well for anything.

5871 2018-09-25 15:24:38 then there will be oil wars for data 
5872 2018-09-25 15:24:32 In @realDonaldTrump speech to the UN, he wants OPEC to stop raising the price of oil. Why are we concerned about OPEC?  I thought we are no longer in need of their oil. We can support ourselves.

It's not pretty, just like drugs + suicides + mass shooting + economic struggles of poor families in US.

All they need is more oil.

Or just homicidal US Presidents from Bush Sr to @realDonaldTrump @jack
5877 2018-09-25 15:24:21 Nordstream pipeline is not oil but natural gas. The pipeline already exists and the plan is now to double it's capacity. 
Why Trump is openly opposing something that Putin strongly supports is curious however.

5885 2018-09-25 15:24:06 Trump asked OPEC to pump more oil to compensate for lack of IRAN oil...he sanctioned..he wanted to keep the price of gasoline lower in the US before elections....well?  OPEC is saying NO and Trump is pissed.  Probably More To Follow.  Trump has saturated the world with sanctions.

5890 2018-09-25 15:23:50 Playin for PSG is like playin for man city, nobody cares cos its artificial its all financial doping and just image laundering for oil rich states with atrocious human rights records
5891 2018-09-25 15:23:47 Not sure about that part. That's at a government level. I do see money leaving the Canadian oilpatch at a time when world oil prices should have us growing. Selling our resources at bargain prices hurts the entire country.
5892 2018-09-25 15:23:47 그런 말 했었음?
5893 2018-09-25 15:23:47 Sanctions on Iran is simply doing favors to opec member states. With oil price going up, now at an all time high in four years, i see the hands of saudi and middle east state using their reliable ally @realDonaldTrump to cripple irans economy

5896 2018-09-25 15:23:39 BOOM @POTUS Trump puts OPEC on notice: "We defend many of these nations for nothing, and then they take advantage of us by giving us high oil prices. Not good. We want them to stop raising prices... and they must contribute substantially to military protection from now on."
5897 2018-09-25 15:23:29 This was set for that purpose only! Data is new Oil Boss, so everyone is storing all the data to do business.

5899 2018-09-25 15:23:27 Not one mention of the global need to work together to resolve #climate change, the most imminent threat facing humanity - but #Trump did pimp #AmericaFirst oil industry and ‘clean’ coal. #UNGA

5907 2018-09-25 15:23:05 Yup, chiming in to add that Calgary and Edmonton have this weird ‘rivalry’ because historically Edmonton has been the blue-collar, artsy provincial capital, and oil money Calgary thinks it should be the natural seat of power. It’s stupid and childish.
5908 2018-09-25 15:23:03 I need a boyfriend or a friend so they can take my truck to get a oil change and other shit I don’t want

5915 2018-09-25 15:22:43 This speech only proves Trump is incapable of learning.
The last time OPEC increased production and lowered the global price of crude was 2011-2016, price of oil went to below $50/barrel and gas prices were great!
This almost Bankrupted US oil producers. Take an Economics class!

5917 2018-09-25 15:22:33 Indeed emissions keep on rising every year - huge swathes of Arctic being open to oil drilling - green energy uptake insignificant compared to the challenge of fighting global warming - Paris Agreement too little too late even it was fully implemented and it is not.

5919 2018-09-25 15:22:30 By the time the oil companies can offset massive expenditure against tax, there isn't a lot of income from oil. And certainly not enough for an 'oil fund' or to replace the Barnett money we would lose if we left the UK. Andrew Wilson of the Growth Commission has said that.
5920 2018-09-25 15:22:28 Oil prices were the trigger, but the cause lies with poor government planning

5923 2018-09-25 15:22:23 Pepsi profits from dirty palm oil. Unless CEO @IndraNooyi takes responsibility and ends @PepsiCo’s business deal with #palmoil offender @Indofood, Pepsi will continue to prop up the destruction of Indonesia’s #rainforests and #orangutans
5924 2018-09-25 15:22:23 Germany  was just filmed laughing @realDonaldTrump’s statements on oil and OPEC during Trumps speech at the UN.
5925 2018-09-25 15:22:12 ...have imposed some sanctions on several countries to stop getting crude oil from Iran. And the second round of sanctions are going to be launched on November the 5th. Its a bloody Agenda where we signed earlier and we turned out from the Iranian regime is considered to be a..
5926 2018-09-25 15:22:11 Trump rants against OPEC for rising oil prices. More bullshit from Trump and Ross. Oil prices rising from dummy taking Iran’s oil out of markets by his dumping a treaty that Iran was honoring.The ‘NOTMY FAULT’ excuse is turning to a catch all used by his Administration.

5929 2018-09-25 15:22:06 It has been a while since we started a war over oil, the GOP must be getting withdrawals
5930 2018-09-25 15:22:03 @DanaBashCNN notes that in all the talk of ‘Sovereignty’ @realDonaldTrump did not mention Russia.. Russia’s incursions into Syria.. Russia’s attack on American Sovereignty and continuing interference in U.S. elections. Not a word of russia except throwaway on oil & germany #UNGA
5931 2018-09-25 15:22:01 It's true, the corporate wing has really taken over the party. For instance, they recently said they will start accepting oil money again. However, it is still the best option for getting change. Hwvr, the party has always been split between business and unions.
5932 2018-09-25 15:22:01 I understand that #China is willing to provide road construction + other services to #SouthSudan in return for oil exports. If oil production doesn't return to full capacity as soon as is hoped, will such debts be forgiven?

5940 2018-09-25 15:21:37 Rachel couldn’t help noticing how elegant Claire was, and how her voice was so smooth and evenly modulated. “Like butter,” she thought. “Or truffle oil.” She giggled, fortunately this time not out loud. 

Claire had her hand on Jack’s forearm. “I really want to see the drawings.”
5941 2018-09-25 15:21:35 Mines a 2012, so a little older but it runs great. Also you get oil changes every 10,000 miles instead of every 3000
5942 2018-09-25 15:21:33 UN General Assembly 2018: US President Donald Trump has asked all nations to isolate Iran's leadership, and vowed that more sanctions will follow after the resumption of oil sanctions on November 5.
5943 2018-09-25 15:21:32 If USA has lot of oil reserves(according to trump) why cant they sell it cheap,why wait for OPEC to reduce their prices,a speech which centered on war against other countries who cant be bullied by usa.
5944 2018-09-25 15:21:29 Every time there's a sudden weather change, my skin goes wacky. I put olive oil in my hair. (My hair dresser is very Italian and believes olive oil is better than coconut oil) I also mix it with avocado so it stays in like a hair mask.
5945 2018-09-25 15:21:27 Well what are the options I see only one pump more oil in US and release oil from the reserve . If US would not defent "them" the price will be even higher in case of a conflict.
5946 2018-09-25 15:21:23 The #rainforests are our planet’s beating heart & the #orangutans that swing in the trees of #Indonesia are one of its most precious creatures. Don’t let dirty #palmoil destroy this. I’m calling on @PepsiCo’s CEO @IndraNooyi to stop dealing with palm oil villain @Indofood

5956 2018-09-25 15:21:05 JP Morgan issuing a warning that the CAD could drop 10% on a NAFTA failure should be concerning to all Canadians. Higher oil prices may be good for producers, but considering how much we import, it would be devastating for consumers.
5957 2018-09-25 15:21:04 Women are likely working more now because single family incomes are no longer enough in places like Alberta where high paying oil and gas jobs are scarce.
5958 2018-09-25 15:21:03 That's less than a dollar per square foot affected by the deep horizon oil spill. This isn't impressive.

5964 2018-09-25 15:20:48 The world laughing at Donald Trumps bullshit is a beautiful thing. Americans who swallow this bullshit will be very confused and no doubt angered by this. But the world has seen enough to know he’s full of bullshit. Even if one third of Americans still buy the snake oil.

5971 2018-09-25 15:20:29 In the last presidency, the administration's policies of increasing fuel economy standards and incentives for clean energy and clean power reduced fossil fuel demand thus decreasing oil prices.

5973 2018-09-25 15:20:26 My sides are splitting here, he's a genius in the art fucktardness.He says America is now self reliant on oil and has so much they export it,then goes onto ripping a hole in OPEC over the price of oil America has to pay.
5974 2018-09-25 15:20:20 In encumbered speech, he is escalating the war on everything from tariffs, to oil, Americas aid to other countries.  Where the hell is Putin in all this mess?

5996 2018-09-25 15:19:46 Indian imports of oil from Iran in August dropped a third from July, but if you compare the Aug 2018 no. to Aug 2017, there’s an over 50% increase.

6019 2018-09-25 15:18:39 I think we are going to face high prices again like we have already faced twice in the past decade. Their policies are lousy. Of course Trump should be blamed for sactioning Iran but oil prices were still rising (Brent was 70ish) before the sanctions were announced.
6020 2018-09-25 15:18:37 @realDonaldTrump you just said you aren’t “going to put up with #OPEC raising oil prices” well, sanctioning Iranian oil and taking 1.5 million barrels of oil a day from the market RAISES OIL PRICES!!!! #UNGA2018 #TRUMPUNGA

6044 2018-09-25 15:17:33 President @realDonaldTrump doesn't deliver any bombshells (no 'rocket man') to world leaders at #UNGA. German diplomats laughed at his suggestion they would be totally dependent on Russian oil. Laughter 2 at his suggestion he'd accomplished more than any admin. in US history.

6056 2018-09-25 15:17:15 Talk about POTUS being interfering with the reference to oil prices. What gives him the right to dictate to other sovereign nations how to price their commodities. Telling Germany where to get their energy from. Hypocritical. One way the US way.
6057 2018-09-25 15:17:14 When you limit the supply by threatening all of your allies if they buy Iranian oil, then the world price goes up. Economics! Didn't you learn that at Wharton?

6099 2018-09-25 15:15:47 Look for oil prices to rise. That's the best case. Worst case is they fund some anti-American activity. Trump is bent on making the world as chaotic as possible. Chaos benefits dictators and con men.

6134 2018-09-25 15:14:21 The oil companies own the oil that they extract. Any revenue that comes to 'us' is in the form of tax. There isn't much of that now, with Swinney having persuaded Osborne to slash tax on oil companies when the price plummeted. You live in a fantasy world.

Please drop dirty palm oil and end forest destruction.
6159 2018-09-25 15:13:24 Did you know that Pepsi has a palm oil problem? I want @IndraNooyi, the CEO of @PepsiCo to take responsibility for destroying #orangutans precious rainforest home and end her deals with dodgy #palmoil company @Indofood today!

6161 2018-09-25 15:13:22 What?! @PepsiCo STILL profits from exploitation #palmoil? Tell CEO @IndraNooyi to end her deals with palm oil villains @Indofood now

6163 2018-09-25 15:13:11 . Good one. No sacrifice is complete without palm oil
6164 2018-09-25 15:13:06 I’ve been putting off getting my oil changed cause I get really anxious talking on the phone about appointments and shit like that and I could’ve done it online the whole time
6165 2018-09-25 15:12:59 Sounds like he pulled a shirt out the clean laundry that his father usually wears in the garage while changing the oil on the family vehicle! 
6166 2018-09-25 15:12:53 But will it actually have an affect on the price of #oil? Only time will tell.
6167 2018-09-25 15:12:52 Kale is pretty awful, except for when its baked with olive oil and garlic and made like chips, most Gatorade is gross, but I could have a BLT for dinner with a glass of bourbon and happy dance
6168 2018-09-25 15:12:45 @Ritzcrackers Will you please stop buying dirty palm oil from Wilmar. You must surely know that you're fuelling mass deforestation. We're watching you. No excuses
6169 2018-09-25 15:12:42 From our Fuel Oil FAQ page:  What Is Kerosene?

Kerosene, or "K-1" in the Northeast, is simply a further refined blend of fuel oil. Any oil burning system can use kerosene but certain equipment (i.e. Monitor heaters) cannot use fuel oil and must burn only kerosene.
6170 2018-09-25 15:12:36 Trump laying down threats about oil prices. Says we won’t put up with it much longer. #UNGA2018 #UNGA #OPEC

6173 2018-09-25 15:12:32 Or they possibly could be worried about demand, hence a cut would magnify the problems for them.  Reason I stay away from all this, is we never really know the thought process behind every move.  Also why I didn't really watch the Algiers meeting TBH
6174 2018-09-25 15:12:28 Trump draining the swamp called ‘opec’ The Zoo called Nigeria will finally collaps once no more oil money bastards.

No wonder they run to China to borrow more more to sustain the dead experiment
6175 2018-09-25 15:12:27 The #rainforests are our planet’s beating heart & the #orangutans that swing in the trees of #Indonesia are one of its most precious creatures. Don’t let dirty #palmoil destroy this. I’m calling on @PepsiCo’s CEO @IndraNooyi to stop dealing with palm oil villain @Indofood

#howseriousisisis
6180 2018-09-25 15:12:17 Yes. And it slows to expansion in the Baaken ... established wells keep churning out oil but they halt exploratory drilling and new wells once oil drops below a certain price (I think it’s around $75 but I’m not positive on that).
6181 2018-09-25 15:12:10 Brent crude up $1 to $82.24 a barrel. 
The #oil market is giving Trump the same treatment it gave #OPEC on Monday. Very nice words; now, if you want to move the price, show us the barrels, very please. For OPEC was an output hike. For Trump, it's clearly a SPR release. #OOTT
6182 2018-09-25 15:12:09 Yes pubis...

6184 2018-09-25 15:12:02 Wonder why the US imports so much Canadian oil if they have so much of their own?
6185 2018-09-25 15:11:59 @Ritzcrackers never mind all your sponsorships when are you going to stop contributing to deforestation by palm oil producers
6186 2018-09-25 15:11:54 When he commented on Germany having to rely on Russian oil, there was bewilderment in the faces of those diplomats. Trump or whoever wrote that has lost it. America is not what it use to be. Trump destroyed America. There is no doubt, he is a divider.
6187 2018-09-25 15:11:50 Listening to Trump address the UN. It must be embarrassing to be laughed at when you have such a stern face while talking. Strongest laughter was when he said Germany will become dependent on Russian oil. Terrible to have a fool for president of the US
6188 2018-09-25 15:11:47 Dear @IndraNooyi I heard about Pepsi’s palm oil problem and I really hope that you’ll cut ties with @Indofood in your final week as CEO. I love #orangutans and our #rainforests too. Don’t let them die for cheap #palmoil

6196 2018-09-25 15:11:34 Again, why is gas over $4.00 per gallon if we have oil to export all over, and why are grocery prices increasing weekly??? If Trump cares so much about out country, he needs to get this resolved quickly.
6197 2018-09-25 15:11:12 Today Trump spoke like a regular consumer, yes oil prices are bothering. You don't see other commodities reaching 4 year high. OPEC+ should dissolve the oil production cut. The EM crisis should not be underestimated.
6198 2018-09-25 15:11:11 I’ve been sick for over a month with a sinus infection & an ear infection. I’ve tried oregano oil, colloidal silver, DayQuil, tinctures, and antibiotics... I think this is the end

6202 2018-09-25 15:10:53 efficascent oil gaming from now on
6203 2018-09-25 15:10:51 Venezuela was not destroyed by “socialism” but by the oil glut of the 1980s that caused Venezuela’s economy to contract followed by currency devaluation and inflation. 

I guess “the truth isn’t the truth” when you’re trying to create a narrative for shaping worldview and policy.

6205 2018-09-25 15:10:43 If the #UnitedStates is now the world’s largest oil producer, why can’t we work against #OPEC to keep #Oil prices low? What happens if the Federal Government provided #subsidizes to oil producers to dump oil onto the world market?

6207 2018-09-25 15:10:34 Of course we have embraced Saudi Arabia again the true financiers of terror and chaos in the world and returned to painting their oil competition the Iranians as the bad guy,and on top of it all made a terrible weapons deal with SA which will make sure Isil gets what they need.
6208 2018-09-25 15:10:27 So the idiot wants US to slink into its shell & become racist, nutty & introverted neighbour BUT have nations sell it cheap oil to do so?

6230 2018-09-25 15:09:29 What PRESIDENT TRUMP tell it like it really is !! So thanks for a realistic speech, watching the German delegation laughing when he spoke of Germany’s soon to be total reliance on Russian oil for energy and thinking” they’re whistling in the graveyard”.
6231 2018-09-25 15:09:27 If, as Trump told UN, we are the world's largest energy country, and we have abundant oil to export - why did I just pay more than $4.00 for a gallon of gasoline?????????????? This, coupled with increasing grocery prices, is really hard to stomach.
6232 2018-09-25 15:09:26 So far @realDonaldTrump has offended nearly every country at #UNGA18 by calling out unfair trade, collusion on oil prices, stupidly relying on #Russian oil (Germany) etc. Here’s the thing: he’s right!

6266 2018-09-25 15:07:52 I get that but your overall position is to legalize it and most people will be smoking it, not rubbing the oil into their skin
6267 2018-09-25 15:07:51 So OPEC needs to lower oil prices, yet Iran oil is off limits and we're increasing sanctions on Venezuela as well. Where is this increased oil supply coming from?

6271 2018-09-25 15:07:40 Keep bullying & keep imposing tariffs- you’ll fuck the economy up so bad (the healthy one you inherited from Obama) & oil will be $150 a barrel- go back to beauty pageants & reality tv host - 2 moronic things only an imbecile like you can excel at -
6272 2018-09-25 15:07:39 then... stop sanctioning all the other oil producers... ?
6273 2018-09-25 15:07:39 @realDonaldTrump announcing additional sanctions against #Venezuela while speaking to United Nations. Wants lower #oil prices but additional #Iran sanctions have been pushing up #energy costs and #stocks in #USA and #Canada significantly lately. Let's see how the #markets react.
6274 2018-09-25 15:07:37 Is POTUS slurring his speech #UnitedNations?  Nice to see #Germany laughing at his remarks on dependence on Russian oil.  Jingoism at its finest.
6275 2018-09-25 15:07:28 Sean and good faith = oil and water.
6276 2018-09-25 15:07:25 Hey great. We're gonna get a price hike from OPEC and then try to steal Venezuela's oil while also pissing off our allies in the process. 

Doing great America.
6277 2018-09-25 15:07:18 Pepsi profits from dirty palm oil. Unless CEO @IndraNooyi takes responsibility and ends @PepsiCo’s business deal with #palmoil offender @Indofood, Pepsi will continue to prop up the destruction of Indonesia’s #rainforests and #orangutans
6278 2018-09-25 15:07:16 Wouldnt it be great if they just had enough of ALL this shit and boo'd him off the stage? Its not even that hes wrong, he has no fuckinng clue what hes talking about. OPEC doesnt  "set" oil prices. Markets do. They can tinker with production, but thats not what hes talking about
6279 2018-09-25 15:07:13 If I tell you say your head get too much oil you nur go bliv
6280 2018-09-25 15:07:10 Trump isnt messing around. Its only been 2 years and he has turned the shit storm around. I believe oil prices will drop alot soon. Trump said we defend many countries for free and are repaid with high oil prices. Soon we will stop defending them for free.......
6281 2018-09-25 15:07:09 Saudi Arabia's King Salman on Tuesday inaugurated a 6.7 billion euro ($7.87 billion) high-speed rail linking the two holiest cities in Islam, part of efforts to boost tourism revenues as the country seeks to shed dependence on oil exports.
6282 2018-09-25 15:07:06 #IraniansWantRegimeChange, becasue this fanatic and satanic regime, don't care to out of work people, and the revenus from the oil dosen't spend to create new jobs. The money are given to dictatorship country like Syria and Assad.
6283 2018-09-25 15:07:03 Oil continues its ascent with Brent Crude hitting $82.30 as #Trump lays into Iran at the #UNGA. $90 by the end of the year doesn't seem fanciful.
6284 2018-09-25 15:07:02 Ada perbedaannya kok, yg evoo memang ada proses yg lebih panjang sehingga terasa "lebih" dari olive oil biasa. Warna fi botol itu untuk memudahkan.
6285 2018-09-25 15:06:59 Since we talking about boiled egg...we might as well add palm oil. Very essential

6289 2018-09-25 15:06:54 OPEC OIL PRICES HIT 82USD DUE TO COMING IRANIAN OIL SANCTIONS 
The global economy could be damaged if oil prices return to $100 (£76) a barrel, experts have warned, after crude prices hit a four-year high of $82.
6290 2018-09-25 15:06:52 If you ever meet someone with a oil pen wait until they take a hit and go... “whicho bitchass vape” and watch them become triggered.
6291 2018-09-25 15:06:51 me too :) we did do cbd oil, it helped keep him out of pain and in a good mood while we did other treatments.  we did a little hydro-therapy on the water treadmill to keep him moving, and the main thing we think helped was that we also did stim treatments 2 times daily.  it +
6292 2018-09-25 15:06:47 @realDonaldTrump is going after Venezuela? They must have oil!

6294 2018-09-25 15:06:38 US Stocks were little changed on Tuesday, as higher oil prices lifted energy stocks and banks rose in anticipation of an interest rate hike, but losses in FB & chipmakers weighed on the market.

6300 2018-09-25 15:06:23 Donald Trumpet contradicting himself on every front including blaming OPEC for increasing oil price. It's his foreign policy pushing oil price higher....
6301 2018-09-25 15:06:21 @DAVILACOLON "Today socialism has bankrupted the once oil rich nation".....Trump on Venezuela at ONU
6302 2018-09-25 15:06:20 Watching Trump’s speech to the U.N. Germany laughing at him when he states Germany will become dependent on Russia for its oil. I don’t think his speech is going over too well.
6303 2018-09-25 15:06:20 Trump at UN:  “We defend OPEC countries for nothing.” Going forward, the Pres expects them to pay their own freight.#oil #gas #UNGA

6305 2018-09-25 15:06:15 Would you like to meet some Iraqi survivors of our 2nd war for oil for some idea of what kind of sick actions #Republicans are capable of.  Ask them about their dead loved ones. It would help put things in perspective. #WhyWeResist #Resist
6306 2018-09-25 15:06:13 The #rainforests are our planet’s beating heart & the #orangutans that swing in the trees of #Indonesia are one of its most precious creatures. Don’t let dirty #palmoil destroy this. I’m calling on @PepsiCo’s CEO @IndraNooyi to stop dealing with palm oil villain @Indofood
6307 2018-09-25 15:06:12 Prior to that he attacked Iran with more sanctions against there oil exports, makes sense

6311 2018-09-25 15:06:09 Trump lambasts OPEC, Iran, Venezuela, Assad. Threatens more sanctions on Iran, asks OPEC to sell oil on reasonable price, slaps sanctions against Maduro and his aides.
6312 2018-09-25 15:06:08 Trump order to OPEC once more lower the oil price pay for your military protection accuses opec of ripping off the world
6313 2018-09-25 15:06:02 I am afraid but he has lost his bearish charms
6314 2018-09-25 15:06:01 When trump gives a speech he looks like a Barker selling snake oil.
6315 2018-09-25 15:06:00 Ironically, the producers of 50% of US oil LIKE high oil prices since it's produced in the US...
6316 2018-09-25 15:05:58 OMG listening to Comrade Trump address the UN is brutal. He sounds like a mob boss, telling oil producers that they need to reduce their prices or else.  He told Germany to fix their dependence on Russian oil, and the German delegates laughed at him. He is a total embarrassment.
6317 2018-09-25 15:05:56 There was an egg farm in Ohio who was using separated kids as child slave labor under Obama. Don’t even f ing ask for the link cuz you can google its you damn self.

6329 2018-09-25 15:05:27 @realDonaldTrump hits out at OPEC telling world leaders at #UNGA "we want them to lower oil prices.. we're not going to put up with these horrible prices much longer".
6330 2018-09-25 15:05:26 Oil prices are dictated by the market. Output is dictated by #OPEC
6331 2018-09-25 15:05:25 Who wrote Trump's UN speech? First, he said the U.S. is the world's largest energy producer and stands ready to export energy around the world. Then he complained about the impact of OPEC oil price hikes on the U.S. That's doublespeak.
6332 2018-09-25 15:05:25 The message isn’t for his bribery partners in KSA it’s a message to tell his voters he’s ‘tough’. Odd now that US is an oil exporter. Maybe he should be railing against US oil.
6333 2018-09-25 15:05:24 Educate yourself. It’s not about smoking weed, you really have no idea, do you? You do not smoke the cannabis, you ingest the cannabis oil. And here I go educating you....
6334 2018-09-25 15:05:21 The greatest accomplishment @realDonaldTrump could do in his term would be to go from a capitalistic economy to a renewable energy economy. Create new jobs. Eliminate dependency on foreign oil. Help the environment. No more regime change wars. Save the planet. #TuesdayThoughts

 It's just an act. Who will benefit from "higher" oil prices? Saudi Arabia his buddy and Russia, his master.

6365 2018-09-25 15:04:36 This part of Trump’s #UNGA speech bashing OPEC is clearly a way to set the path for blaming those countries for the increase in oil prices that will inevitably happen when the next round of sanctions hit Iran on Nov. 5th.

I am 35 years old.

I have two master's degrees. I had to take literal classes in FINDING INFORMATION.

I've lived alone for 14 years. I am capable of a wide range of things, including changing my own oil, and doing minor plumbing and electrical work.
6391 2018-09-25 15:03:41 I'm sure there's a good amount of that, along with oil from submerged vehicles, sewage spills and plain old mud. Hopefully by next summer it'll be flushed away so the tourism industry at the beaches won't suffer so badly.
6392 2018-09-25 15:03:39 LOOKS LIKE GERMANY DIDN'T APPRECIATE OUR @POTUS REMARK ABT, DEPENDENCY OF OIL FROM PUTIN, OH WELL GET WITH IT.    MERKEL !

6395 2018-09-25 15:03:36 Pepsi profits from dirty palm oil. Unless CEO @IndraNooyi takes responsibility and ends @PepsiCo’s business deal with #palmoil offender @Indofood, Pepsi will continue to prop up the destruction of Indonesia’s #rainforests and #orangutans
6396 2018-09-25 15:03:36 Pepsi has a palm oil problem & its CEO @IndraNooyi has one week left at the helm, it’s time for her to end @PepsiCo’s deals with scandal-mired #palmoil business partner @Indofood
6397 2018-09-25 15:03:36 The #rainforests are our planet’s beating heart & the #orangutans that swing in the trees of #Indonesia are one of its most precious creatures. Don’t let dirty #palmoil destroy this. I’m calling on @PepsiCo’s CEO @IndraNooyi to stop dealing with palm oil villain @Indofood
6398 2018-09-25 15:03:33 Because at least America has electricity and clean water in 99% of the country unlike Iran who has huge oil reserves but is unable provide water or electricity to the majority of the population
6399 2018-09-25 15:03:31 Mostly just xenophobic nonsense. US imperialism should retreat & NATO should be removed but he isn’t doing that, instead he’s promoting extra spending, nuclear weapons development, fracking oil, and threatening war. He IS NOT non interventionist, the mask has merely been removed
6400 2018-09-25 15:03:27 Contrary to his Tweet &statement before his #UNGA speech, the #Iran part of his speech was from Bolton, Pompeo, Halley playbook. 2 parts stood out:

More sanctions will follow Nov nuclear sanctions. 

Oil imports must be reduced "substantially"--backing from from "reduce to zero"
6401 2018-09-25 15:03:25 First the oil. And now tariffs on economic goods. The U.S. and its allies that are loyal to the Trump regime and foregoing the Bush plan of the New World Order. The 9/11 plan is still in play and your sovereign rights are slowly being stripped from us ex: #WhyIDidntReport
6402 2018-09-25 15:03:22 The representatives of @GermanyUN could not look more in disbelief when they heard Trump’s characteristic of Germany as becoming dependent on Russian oil
6403 2018-09-25 15:03:20 Also:
Come buy our cheap, plentiful oil! (Next paragraph) OPEC is mean for charging the U.S. high prices for oil!
6404 2018-09-25 15:03:19 Yeah, #Opec, lower your prices, @realDonaldTrump will print Dollar, buys your oil and sells to the world 10 times more expensive. Listen to this guy please. #UNGA
6405 2018-09-25 15:03:14 Did you know that Pepsi has a palm oil problem? I want @IndraNooyi, the CEO of @PepsiCo to take responsibility for destroying #orangutans precious rainforest home and end her deals with dodgy #palmoil company @Indofood today!
6406 2018-09-25 15:03:07 Did anyone just see the German Ambassadors at the UN, laughing at Trump, when he said Germany will be fully dependent on Russia for their oil?
6407 2018-09-25 15:03:05 Pepsi profits from dirty palm oil. Unless CEO @IndraNooyi takes responsibility and ends @PepsiCo’s business deal with #palmoil offender @Indofood, Pepsi will continue to prop up the destruction of Indonesia’s #rainforests and #orangutans
6408 2018-09-25 15:03:04 Just one point - Obama lifted the oil embargo ban, allowing this bullshit energy grab, raping our country and planet.
6409 2018-09-25 15:03:03 It's @PepsiCo CEO @IndraNooyi's final week, but she still hasn't fixed Pepsi's #palmoil problem. I want her to save the #orangutans and leave a legacy free from #rainforest #deforestation & #workerabuse - by dropping palm oil villain @Indofood now!

6412 2018-09-25 15:03:00 Heiko Maas’ face - and that of the German delegation - when Trump mentions Germany’s “complete dependence” on Russian oil was something  

But the irony of following that with a statement about the US not accepting foreign interference was mind-boggling. #UNGA

6417 2018-09-25 15:02:52 #Trump #UN Once again demanding #OPEC to lower oil prices ...
6418 2018-09-25 15:02:49 *Give us cheap oil or we'll let you die.*
6419 2018-09-25 15:02:48 If we are the World leader in oil production, then why should we be buying oil from OPEC?  Freeze them out and use our own oil.  Gas prices in those countries are very cheap - why not in the U.S.?

#UNGA 

Nigeria needs to "mean" diversification.
6422 2018-09-25 15:02:34 The German delegation’s reaction to POTUS’s claim that Germany will be totally dependent on Russian oil was priceless. #UNGA #UNGA73
6423 2018-09-25 15:02:29 The Germans are smirking at Trumps comments on oil.  They still don’t get it about being dependent on Russia for energy!
6424 2018-09-25 15:02:29 So to recap POTUS, we're going to ask those who buy crude oil from Iran to buy less of it, thereby increasing global demand, but we also want lower oil prices in general.
6425 2018-09-25 15:02:26 Dear @IndraNooyi I heard about Pepsi’s palm oil problem and I really hope that you’ll cut ties with @Indofood in your final week as CEO. I love #orangutans and our #rainforests too. Don’t let them die for cheap #palmoil
6426 2018-09-25 15:02:25 President Trump is absolutely right! We provide free defense and then some of these nations raise oil prices on us. The days of taking advantage of America are over under this presidency. @OPECSecretariat #UNGA73

6440 2018-09-25 15:02:08 Now #Trump is attacking #OPEC which can't sit well in the Gulf.
He seems not to understand that oil prices are historically low. His policies are threatening to drive the price up. It is, once again just embarrassing be an American today. #UNGA

6442 2018-09-25 15:02:03 #PalmOil is causing havoc to Indonesian forests & wildlife. @PepsiCo is fuelling this, through business partnership with one of the industry’s worst offenders @Indofood. RT to join me in calling on CEO @IndraNooyi to end Pepsi’s palm oil crimes
6443 2018-09-25 15:02:02 it has occured to me that they are just mad because they thought we were all out weaving daisy chains or picking out our latest essential oil or something. *rolls eyes*
6444 2018-09-25 15:02:01 I think this has always been the promises since 1999 and nothing changed. 
Buhari never expected to be borrowing after we experienced such an oil boom. An excess of $100 per barrel. But he met a agg when he was expecting a lion.
6445 2018-09-25 15:02:01 Dear @IndraNooyi I heard about Pepsi’s palm oil problem and I really hope that you’ll cut ties with @Indofood in your final week as CEO. I love #orangutans and our #rainforests too. Don’t let them die for cheap #palmoil

6450 2018-09-25 15:01:48 Trump at UNGA: Bashes OPEC - OPEC and OPEC members "have been ripping off" the rest of the world with high oil prices, criticizing US partner Saudi Arabia and other US Gulf allies. Demands they lower oil prices and contribute more to their own security.
6451 2018-09-25 15:01:47 POTUS Trump praises Poland and chastises Germany on Russia oil/gas dependency.
6452 2018-09-25 15:01:45 @VelshiRuhle Who benefits from greater sanctions on Iranian oil?  Why Exxon & Friends!  A commodity whose cost to produce fluctuates no more than the milk industry’s in any given year, has price fluctuations 2-3x within a year because of such political manipulations.  And laughs.
6453 2018-09-25 15:01:44 Two points. 

1- @potus seems medicated
2- @potus ha no idea how OPEC works or why we defend the oil producing nations and our allies in the Middle East. 

@HallettRob
6454 2018-09-25 15:01:44 If these countries do business with Iran, we should shut them out.  It’s you’re with or you’re against us.  We should start bringing troops out of Germany & any other country doing business with Iran.  Increase trade restrictions on China. Block oil exports from Iran.
6455 2018-09-25 15:01:42 NEW #Trump war is on #OPEC: which is "ripping off the rest of the world". Members raise oil prices while #US pays their defence bills. Watch this space, he tells #UNGA2018

6458 2018-09-25 15:01:39 So far in this #UNGA speech:

- the audience has straight up laughed at Trump
- Trump has bragged about his tax cuts
- Trump has bragged about the power of the U.S. military
- Trump has complained about oil prices
6459 2018-09-25 15:01:38 The #rainforests are our planet’s beating heart & the #orangutans that swing in the trees of #Indonesia are one of its most precious creatures. Don’t let dirty #palmoil destroy this. I’m calling on @PepsiCo’s CEO @IndraNooyi to stop dealing with palm oil villain @Indofood

6464 2018-09-25 15:01:33 It's very true, but to be honest, don't beat yourself up over oven chips anyway. They're just potato with a smidgen of oil, unlike fried chips.  When he was on a fitness kick, my bro cooked frying chips in the oven to keep the fat down. Cheap as. And you can't go wrong with peas.
6465 2018-09-25 15:01:32 "We protect these nations for nothing, and then they take advantage of us with high oil prices. Not good. We’re not going to put with it -- these horrible prices -- for much longer." - POTUS

Our #rainforests and the planet’s last #orangutans depend on this conflict Palm oil is used in household items also.
6467 2018-09-25 15:01:30 Trump having a dig at OPEC for high oil prices-- whilst saying that the US is the biggest producer of that very commodity, thus benefiting from said price-- is so #MAGA it hurts my head #UNGA

6469 2018-09-25 15:01:29 Watching the foreign press' reaction to Trump's speech is quite entertaining. Raucous laughter at Germany's reaction when Trump said Germany is poised to become dependent on Russian oil.

6516 2018-09-25 15:00:20 .@realDonaldTrump: Calling on OPEC to stop raising oil prices and start lowering them. #UNGA
6517 2018-09-25 15:00:18 So extracting our fossil fuels (oil, coal, petroleum) for export, *not* US energy independence is the plan. At least he said it out loud. #UNGA
6518 2018-09-25 15:00:16 The #rainforests are our planet’s beating heart & the #orangutans that swing in the trees of #Indonesia are one of its most precious creatures. Don’t let dirty #palmoil destroy this. I’m calling on @PepsiCo’s CEO @IndraNooyi to stop dealing with palm oil villain @Indofood
6519 2018-09-25 15:00:15 Pepsi has a palm oil problem & its CEO @IndraNooyi has one week left at the helm, it’s time for her to end @PepsiCo’s deals with scandal-mired #palmoil business partner @Indofood

6523 2018-09-25 15:00:09 Trump tells foreign oil producers to start lowering prices, "and they must start contributing substantially to military protection from now on." #UNGA

6531 2018-09-25 14:59:52 I never understood .@realDonaldTrump w/drawing from Iran Nuclear deal, other than .@BarackObama was instrumental in creation. Is it if we claim they violated agreement, they can't sell oil? But Russia CAN? Asking for a friend. Can anyone clarify? #UNGA

6535 2018-09-25 14:59:37 Russia's "interference" consisted of little more than Facebook and Twitter trolls. This is baby shit compared to how Saudi Arabia slashed oil prices in 2004 just to help Bush win the election, or the 1968 or 1980 October Surprises.

6537 2018-09-25 14:59:27 Whooooa Trump OIL
6538 2018-09-25 14:59:20 Basic principle of enviro policy is "polluter pays" (its in Stockholm and Rio decs) We like to think of big oil as the polluter, but the real polluters have been those who burned FFs-i.e., all of us. By focusing on punishing big oil, we let ourselves off the hook. /f
6539 2018-09-25 14:59:17 Ni se le ocurrió pensar que esto tiene que ver con la diginidad nacional, no con "un muro"...
6540 2018-09-25 14:59:16 As soon as you start adding heat or chemicals to men in order to extract their oils, they can no longer be consider "virgin" (extra or otherwise).  This classification is enforced by international treaty.

I might be getting this confused with olive oil.

6548 2018-09-25 14:58:48 Point the gun down, carefully fill the back of the pellet with gun oil, re-cock it while vertical, then take aim. The compression ignition of the oil will give you much greater muzzle velocity & greater hitting power. Pass the sauce.

6567 2018-09-25 14:58:04 When black Americans stand up to say their lives matter, the state uses violence against them

I don't give a fuck if some chants drove Ted Cruz from a restaurant

6596 2018-09-25 14:57:09 Don't think that is the point at all (once you look beyond oil trade). The idea is to ensure that even compliant trade can continue. Most of the companies pulling out of Iran don't face a direct legal issue, they face an operational issue b/c sanctions have throttled the banks.

6654 2018-09-25 14:54:23 It is not. But focusing on punishing big oil can distract from (or occasionally get in the way of) effective climate policy. It;s easier to get people riled up about big oil than to get people riled up to change lifestyles (see Prohibition). 1/

6680 2018-09-25 14:53:27 Yeah, bipartisanship certainly isn't helping.

Honestly, I'd say lobbying is the most detrimental aspect. If we could fix that, we wouldn't have special interest groups, like oil, dictating politics. Consumers value sustainability, look at the increase in organic foods&whatnot.

6764 2018-09-25 14:48:25 There's no way Trudeau and LPC want your bill passed. That would prevent George Soros and Tom Steyer (Tides Foundation) from funneling money to Libs. One of their goals is to stop pipelines. Wouldn't you bribe a government if you owned the most oil tanker rail cars in NA?

6790 2018-09-25 14:45:58 I honestly think it’s the promotion. When you look back, the first season had that great promo with the ladies walking through the oil field in their gowns!  It was iconic!  These last two seasons we haven’t gotten anything.  I blame Bravo.

6842 2018-09-25 14:41:39 Koch brothers are hugely rich as much because Albertans decided 45yrs ago that refining their oil & gas in America, and moving it to market through American pipelines was better for them and for Canadians.

6906 2018-09-25 14:35:02 Agree I've taken advantage of the weakness again today. Volume's dropped right off and AIM need a winner and there's a strong chance it could be #AAOG as they hit oil R1/R2 then Mengo as appraisal wells then the Djeno money shot!
6907 2018-09-25 14:34:48 I don’t understand why people think a good economy will change anything. When oil shot up in price airlines began gouging with baggage fees, fees for everything. Then oil bottomed out. They NEVER lowered prices. Now, it’s going to 35 dollars a bag.

6981 2018-09-25 14:27:22 At $85 Brent, $PVAC realizes about $80 net of transport on a 70-75% oil stream, so big leverage to oil and big convexity with production growing >100% this year and 40-60% next.

Using $80 flat, the stock would be worth $200 at 3.5x 2020 EBITDA

7032 2018-09-25 14:22:33 Mint flavored oil sludge. It tastes good for a second (relative righteousness always does) and then once the mint goes away you realize you’re drinking oil. Ridiculous how addicted I am to sludge.
7033 2018-09-25 14:22:32 @Ritzcrackers stop using #PalmOil oil from suppliers who destroy the #rainforest
7034 2018-09-25 14:22:28 Not for money. Not for oil!

7038 2018-09-25 14:21:49 Oh good Aaron you abstain mate. More votes for remain. Or if you were a remainer then shame on you. Explain why food shortages & losing all the deals with 27+60 = 87 countries is a good thing? If we Brexit crash with nowt, then how do we get oil or anything?

7042 2018-09-25 14:21:19 RAC warns of potential record petrol prices. If oil hits $90 a barrel (as JP Morgan predict could happen after Iran sanctions bite in November) and that is accompanied by fall in pound - unleaded could £1.42 and diesel £1.48 say RAC. Lot of "ifs".

7052 2018-09-25 14:20:22 When I think how many/most European towns are arranged for pedestrians and connected to each other by rail, I'm almost sickened by how the automobile and oil industry were able to purchase our government officials lock, stock and barrel (pun not intentional but appreciated).
7053 2018-09-25 14:20:14 Japan and South Korea no longer buying #Iranian oil. #China biggest market now. Maybe only one. Not good for Iran and EU can be fined, I guess. Dont know the ins and outs of that. But remember BNP Paribas fine....

7078 2018-09-25 14:18:21 Europe is pissed at US cuz of Iran sanctions. Remember, Total SA had billions invested in Iranian oil. Now in trouble. Also...Iran in the market lowered oil prices and now they are up to $80 and change. EU now more dependent on #Russia and COULD potentially open market for US.
7079 2018-09-25 14:18:18 great. nice propaganda. something to show the grandkids in 2050 as they deal with geo-political disruption, in 2060 when the famines start and 2070 when the seas have risen 3m.

you and the rest of big oil have fucked us @suncor. hope those dividends were worth it. #climatechange
7080 2018-09-25 14:18:13 We have more oil\gas than Saudi and Dubai have a look at their infrastructure or indeed Norway that has billions put aside. Where are all our goods taxed oil,gas,whisky,agriculture not Scotland so do me a favour fuck off.

7115 2018-09-25 14:14:51 Oil prices are artificial by the looks of it. They can decrease output and raise the price and rip us off when they feel like it. Electric vehicles are the way of the future and I can't wait. A friend of mine has one and it's the best thing ever.
7116 2018-09-25 14:14:29 The things you guys are proud of confuses me.  Imagine being proud of paying more for an oil change.

7122 2018-09-25 14:13:40 @RitzCrackers is one of the brands that are still buying dirty palm oil from rainforest destroyers! The first step to stop deforestation is to stop working with companies like Wilmar. #DropDirtyPalmOi
7123 2018-09-25 14:13:35 Does TA really signal price rises in oil - I can see it works in crypto but there are so many external factors in oil prices

7132 2018-09-25 14:12:28 Crude oil prices shot to a 4-year high Tuesday, due to imminent U.S. sanctions on Iranian crude exports & the apparent reluctance of OPEC & Russia to raise output to offset the potential hit to global supplies.
7133 2018-09-25 14:12:27 Chief legislative economist Greg Albrecht talking to Board of Regents about expected $300M surplus. He reaffirms that it’s coming from better-than-expected corporate and personal income tax collections, along with small bump from taxes related to oil and gas. #lalege #lagov
7134 2018-09-25 14:12:21 The argument is a bit like the dairy supply management one.  We can meet our own needs, or we can import heavily subsidized product for less than it would cost to make it ourselves. BC oil is not heavy crude. For oilsands, maybe we're thinking too small - maybe there's a niche.
7135 2018-09-25 14:12:18 Is lovely your new way of being nice?  Rouhani is lovely,  Elsisi is lovely, (but also a member of OPEC and raising oil prices).  Macron is lovely.  I'm sure China and Russia are lovely too.

I have a novel idea...elect men (and women) of substance and good character instead of frat boys, good ol’ boys and snake oil salesmen.
In 2016 Congressional pay was $174k per year and that equates to a LIFELONG pension benefit of $139,200 per year. 
Let that sink in.
7149 2018-09-25 14:11:06 Black people add oil because we don't manufacture a lot of it. You know  God is amazing on how he made us. We should rejoice and embrace the differences. Sometimes I think how complicated this all is - to my little mind. 
7150 2018-09-25 14:11:05 Oil change for my Camry was like $80. My oil changes for this Nissan is like $60.
7151 2018-09-25 14:10:59 @Ritzcrackers The makers of Colgate, Dove and Ritz Crackers promised no deforestation palm oil by 2020 but they're way off target. You need to drop Wilmar - will you?

RACQ & Govt spin doctors proclaiming the cost of oil is rising, WTF! Its been hovering between US$67-72 per barrel for nearly a year. 3 years ago it was $100 per barrel & the price per ltr was lower then than what is now predicted. Someone is ripping us off.
7248 2018-09-25 14:02:30 It's industry. we have an 'oil industry' dedicated to not doing alternate energy. And we have a war industry dedicated to invading other counrtries. So far they work, because Americans want to work.
7249 2018-09-25 14:02:28 Crude below 65 is very difficult. Iran sanctions are near and opec is resisting any further output increase. Trump can play his wild card!! I don't know why we can't try shale gas like US did. We can be self dependent on oil to some more extent.
7250 2018-09-25 14:02:25 Two things I’ll apparently never grow out of:

2) Laughing way harder than I should when I see people hit curbs. 

7251 2018-09-25 14:02:16 also, a cleaning service can run you $50-$70 each time. So they come by once a week, u might be paying $200 a month.

That's WAAAAAAAAAAY cheaper than that $500 oil change u get once a year.

7283 2018-09-25 13:58:48 I didn't say that. The ones who work for the oil industry don't have morals though.
7284 2018-09-25 13:58:43 @Ritzcrackers when will you address the palm oil supply to you, when currently you are supplied by the biggest threat to Indonesia’s rainforests, Wilmar?
7285 2018-09-25 13:58:40 Brakes and brake dust are gross. Oil changes are even worse. I mean, how did we even get this tech anyway.

7293 2018-09-25 13:57:58 Susan, I'm very sorry you're suffering. My Mom had intolerable pain with terminal colon cancer in 1991. The BS "solution" then was morphine.
Have tried high mg (1,000 mg) CBD oil or even Marinol? There's no reason you should suffer!
7294 2018-09-25 13:57:55 As #USA sanctions against #Iran bite and @OPECSecretariat and its non-OPEC partners refusing to be cowed by @realDonaldTrump into  increasing production,  crude oil price is rapidly heading to $100 mark.

We can assume $85bbl is achievable which after taxes / costs, netback will be c$60bbl or $9.5m. $5.2m loan / $4.3m to company

7300 2018-09-25 13:57:24 You won’t often find me siding with @tedcruz, a sad oil slick of a human being. But he should be able to read the news on his phone in peace.
7301 2018-09-25 13:57:06 Jennifer from Mass. is really a typical gynocentric feminist demonrat cause she give herself away when she told John that she imagined dunking his head in baby oil & rubbing all over her body. Not something a woman with virtue would say.
7302 2018-09-25 13:57:00 Oil prices surge as Saudis, Russia won't open spigots. Trump mentor in Russia and business cronies in Saudi Arabia won't rescue him from high oil prices. Is Putin dismayed with Trump?
7303 2018-09-25 13:57:00 @Ritzcrackers stop using dirty Wimar Palm Oil and contributing to Indonesian rain forest deforestation.
7304 2018-09-25 13:56:40 Might be hard to see the effects of petrol/Oil in our everyday lives but its more prevalent than anything else we deal with. 

Oil is an expensive non renewable resource that we use nonstop, at the deadly expense of other countries. Oil cost controls the cost of living everywhere
7305 2018-09-25 13:56:37 Republicans need a few folks with a spine like the Iranian official responding to Trump on rising oil prices: "I am telling (Trump), keep quiet, do not do any tweets and then you will be better off in the prices." Basically, he said to sit down and shut up.
7306 2018-09-25 13:56:33 @Ritzcrackers Every 25 seconds a football pitch of forest is lost in Indonesia -Indigenous People, orangutans and the climate are losing out. A lot of this is because huge areas of forest are cleared to plant the palm trees that produce palm oil. It doesn't have to be like this.
7307 2018-09-25 13:56:27 @Ritzcrackers 
What are you doing to help save these rain forests you are taking palm oil from? 
You must know their environmental importance.

7310 2018-09-25 13:56:20 Still no signs of OPEC turning on the taps with a four year high in oil prices. Time for the US step up fracing. There is a reason we are at the top oil producing countries in the world. Let’s show them.
7311 2018-09-25 13:56:15 $30 for an oil change???? What you driving? The Fred flinstone vehicle???
7312 2018-09-25 13:56:12 To me, "Blair" means invading foreign countries on trumped up evidence for oil and to please America. If he ever did anything else, nobody will remember it. Just the blood.
7313 2018-09-25 13:56:01 Agreed, I was making hundreds of thousands of dollars working in the oil field, left that to start my construction business, one of the hardest and most rewarding things. we have grown on average 30-40% each year!!!! I may make it a tad rough on my workerslol

7319 2018-09-25 13:55:37 For sure. + a drug can have MUCH more fish oil/omega 3 content vs. a regular old fish oil pill? Also not surprising a patented product vs. supplement leads to divergent results

7345 2018-09-25 13:52:36 an oil change on a regular car (just oil change and checking fluids) will cost u less than $50 most of the time.

My dad has a GLK and pays $200-$300 once a year for an oil change or every 10,000 miles.

7351 2018-09-25 13:52:09 Those of us that have been familiar with coconuts, before they became popular, know that coconut oil is not exactly good for you. A little is ok, but we use the actual nut.
7352 2018-09-25 13:52:08 @Ritzcrackers cut off Wilmar and their dirty palm oil please!
7353 2018-09-25 13:52:05 You'll still be able to get LPG, it will just be less 'clean.' For instance refineries produce LPG from their operations. Globally about 40% of LPG comes from the refining of crude oil. NZ has it lucky, being able to extract and use straight away.
7354 2018-09-25 13:52:00 perhaps it’s all about the marketing… If they say it’s fish oil it’s natural, doesn’t sound like a drug right? I think they’re going to publish study in Nov Chatted with our depts lipid guy Dr Bazinet earlier. They’ll be lotsa debate on whether they can label it as fish oil!
7355 2018-09-25 13:51:52 Go voir la Nonne au ciné 
7356 2018-09-25 13:51:41 That must be a happy scenario for the oil industry. Golden sunsets.
7357 2018-09-25 13:51:39 The rising value of oil priced in US dollars paired with the falling pound, strangled by the inevitable economic effects of Brexit. This isn't just heating and road fuel impacted, oil is used in pretty much everything associated with manufacturing. Outlook is bleak. #rejectbrexit
7358 2018-09-25 13:51:32 Even the claims of repayment of oil bonds lies flat on their face, has it helped in maintaining fiscal deficit or has it helped in maintaining rupee dollar stability

7362 2018-09-25 13:51:10 4. At the same time, we must not make matters worse by producing and exporting poor palm oil products, half-filled with water or other fluid and tinted with a red colouring. Palm oil ought to be just that, palm oil.
7363 2018-09-25 13:50:48 Hmm.. where do you live? It must be a special, magical place where the water & air are clean, & the prices of groceries, heating oil, gas & every other frigging thing isn't going through the roof... but you got that extra $29/mo in your pay, so all good, eh?

7365 2018-09-25 13:50:36 You urbanites dont understand the USA  is probably funding the protestors without another option but to give them our oil at a reduced rate (loses us 40million per day) if this continues this stalling on all major projects we will be a third world country in short order .

7373 2018-09-25 13:49:58 A fair bit of that is shale production in the Bakken and it's mostly fracking. Alberta oil growth was oil sands which is far more expensive.

Its not normal and we’ve been paying for the Vietnam War, 9/11, the “War on Terror” and this current debt that Congress always increase. Oil is expensive and someone has to pay for it. The old ppl aint doing it so they’re making our generations pay for it.

7415 2018-09-25 13:47:08 But there's been enough of a general correlation between the price of oil and traders' views on inflation over the past few years that it's worth paying attention to.
7416 2018-09-25 13:46:58 US Opening prices: #DOW 0.22% #NASDAQ -0.01% #Ftse100 0.70% #GBPUSD 1.3147 #EURGBP 0.8962 #EURUSD 1.1784 #Gold 0.12% #Oil 0.73%
7417 2018-09-25 13:46:50 3. While we venture to expand our export to products, such as palm oil, in the west there is afoot, a sinister movement to discredit the health benefits of palm oil, declare it harmful to health and ban its use in any product. Everyone must join the fight against such.
7418 2018-09-25 13:46:50 These latest actions by our Democratic Senators is exactly why I am no longer a democrat, they no longer represent me or my middle class family.  I thank God for giving me the strength to #WalkAway from these vile people and it’s Party. Really!
Guilty until proven innocent.

7421 2018-09-25 13:46:43 I gotta get my oil changed today
7422 2018-09-25 13:46:31 Oil is the main one I've thought about and researched a lot. There are others, but oil is the main one that is hard to replace

I've actually thought that maybe all we need to create oil, is a way to create the pressure and heat required to make plankton into oil

Jupiter? :)
7423 2018-09-25 13:46:30 You mean kind of like the price of oil had people losing their jobs 3 years ago?
7424 2018-09-25 13:46:28 @delaneyhowell07 
So if the USA is exporting more oil than Saudi Arabia, why do we need ethanol, at all?
Devastating to wetlands and any marginal cropland. 
Plow, plow, plow.
We should have less corn.
Prices would go up.
7425 2018-09-25 13:46:19 replenished my oil cleanser and I feel like a new woman

7427 2018-09-25 13:46:04 I dont mean iran
I mean the war hawks around Trump
The worst iran can do is bother oil exports as pay back for stopping them from selling theirs

7429 2018-09-25 13:45:50 Use some coconut oil today lol
7430 2018-09-25 13:45:37 agreed, I expected Saudi (oil), Germany and Japan (auto) exports - majority nations who do trade with China have trade deficit including US, UK, Canada, etc.

7433 2018-09-25 13:45:17 Rosehip oil has saved my life! My skin has been so clear since I’ve been using it! #ByeByeScars
7434 2018-09-25 13:45:15 RAC warns of potential record petrol prices. If oil hits $90 a barrel (as JP Morgan predict could happen after Iran sanctions bite in November) and that is accompanied by fall in pound - unleaded could £1.42 and diesel £1.48 say RAC. Lot of "ifs".

7441 2018-09-25 13:44:30 Dr. Uddin, I do not understand why Big Oil would endorse IPCC consensus on AGW in court against its own interest. Perhaps you can give Exxon, Chevron and BP the science that they need to set the record straight. I would love for AGW to be disproven.
7442 2018-09-25 13:44:13 Great for when one owns an oil well!
7443 2018-09-25 13:44:11 "How very good and pleasant it is WHEN KINDRED LIVE TOGETHER IN UNITY (HARMONY)! It is like the fragrant anointing oil  poured over Aaron's head, … It is like the (harmony is as refreshing) dew of Hermon, which falls on the mountains of Zion (Israel)." Psalm 133: 1,2a&3a.

7453 2018-09-25 13:42:59 OIL 15M struggles to move higher. 15M volaitlity is ON now, not significant, but does add a little kick higher to 1H volaitlity. KEY resist is 72.73, a move above this and all rocket engine fire.... WATCH UWT
7454 2018-09-25 13:42:57 On a very basic level, higher oil prices leads to higher consumer prices which generally leads to higher yields. Also, typically increases in oil prices have been associated with faster global growth -- also associated with faster inflation and higher yields.
7455 2018-09-25 13:42:55 I'm also from sringeri and we call Ereyappa as Ereyappa and Guliyappa as Guliyappa. Guliyappa is made from dose better. ereyappa is a combination of rice, coconut, wheat, mentya and jaggery. The batter is deep fried in oil and made for narakachaturdashi. Go ask in your family.
7456 2018-09-25 13:42:54 Would that not indicate that with their much larger consumption that they'd run out much sooner and be reliant on our oil in the future?
7457 2018-09-25 13:42:46 Dili pa init ang oil or di pa luto ug ayo gibali na nimo

7459 2018-09-25 13:42:13 2. NNPC complain of oil smuggling. How many petrol stations have been taken over and owners prosecuted for that or other crimes? Often, we hear of the closure of stations for violations. Are they ever prosecutions of persons found culpable?
7460 2018-09-25 13:42:11 @DVATW can't really be complaining about people's appearances considering he is no oil painting himself. I bet he is one of these christians condemning people, yet eats prawns, wears mixed fibres and oh yeah and judges. As a Christian but hate those that picknmix the bible

7462 2018-09-25 13:42:02 One challenge I've witnessed is the propensity for some to use misleading analytics (false positives as well as sketchy claims of credit/attribution of engagement KPI's.) 

Still have to prove value, I agree. But how do we make the snake oil glow in the dark so it's easy to spot?
7463 2018-09-25 13:41:56 @realDonaldTrump all your foreign buddies in Saudi Arabia and Russia really pleased with your help in raising oil prices every day. Maybe you should consider helping Americans before Russians again here.....

7465 2018-09-25 13:41:51 That’s not a good trade off. Oil change for vacuuming?

7468 2018-09-25 13:41:21 I move that the Petroleum Exploration Bill be read a second time. Resources must be used for the people of Kenya, to benefit local communities and economies. We now have viable blocs of oil, in Turkana and Marakwet, and there may be more counties later - @kipmurkomen #BungeliveKE
7469 2018-09-25 13:41:18 Ain't it comical that wailers who are averse with APC's continued rule of Osun will be in support of the governing party in salary-owed Benue, Kwara & even in Bayelsa, which is lesser than Alimosho LG in Lagos in land mass & population despite being oil rich?
7470 2018-09-25 13:41:08 BUT, I do have to say.. new cars kinda suck. This is my second late model car.. and both use synthetic oil. #expensive
7471 2018-09-25 13:40:53 No, the leftist mantra is share and share alike.  There is nothing radical about expecting health care and education for everyone. We certainly have the wealth. Why should we have tax subsidies for oil companies while people go without health insurance?
7472 2018-09-25 13:40:51 Ngabwe has a rash, him and his pal go to the witchdoctor+the witchdoctor looks at it, cuts his pals heid aff, boils it+He skims the oil fae the pot, rubs it on Ngabwe's rash and it disappears+WOW, amazing, says Ngabwe, whit dae ye call that ?

7473 2018-09-25 13:40:50 YesToLife is a fraudy scammy sham of a “charity” that funnels desperate patients into the clutches of unethical snake oil peddlers and charlatans. Pts and families are misinformed, misled, and harmed medically, emotionally and financially.

7480 2018-09-25 13:40:31 1970年代に、中東からの石油の供給が中断した。
In the 1970s, oil supplies from the Middle East were disrupted.
7481 2018-09-25 13:40:28 Mississippi got $700,000,000 in a settlement from BP after the oil spill. out of that money, Madison County gets over $8,000,000 for bozeman road to parkway east. Clinton gets over $1,000,000 for street resurfacing. Jackson gets $50,000 to fix a bridge. that’s it. literally.

7486 2018-09-25 13:40:17 Are we going to continue to depend on oil as a nation after the 2019 elections or will there be a deliberate attempt to shift focus to other sectors? 

Let the debate begin

7487 2018-09-25 13:40:15 I love how I took my car in for an oil change and then they decided to do a wheel alignment without asking or telling me.
7488 2018-09-25 13:40:13 Apparently they have been paying 3 million off the debt every year since 2005, rather be ran by oil merchants than rinsed by the yanks

7503 2018-09-25 13:38:56 Oil.... Till it crosses USD 100 per barrel.. Shale oil production ( US has largest reserve) is not economically viable.. US very strategically ensuring it.. Countries in middle east must understand this.. The sooner the better .. For India..it is a problem in both cases..

7507 2018-09-25 13:38:23 Comb your hair more often it will increase blood supply of scalp which helps. 
Use coconut oil every other day and wash hair with any selenium sulfide shampoo every other day. That should help.
7508 2018-09-25 13:38:15 If you ever get one of those bumps, use 100% Tea Tree oil. Wash it, dry it and then put that on it in the morning and when you go to bed. That always works really well for me! It has a strong smell
7509 2018-09-25 13:38:02 You have good experience blackmailing big oil for AGW ransom like UN has been doing by coercing oil donations to fund its annual COP renewable sales parties. 
Do you?

7513 2018-09-25 13:37:23 Absolutely @TamaraMcCleary digital data fuels our current world as much or more than oil 
7514 2018-09-25 13:37:21 As a woman I want electoral reform and no more oil subsidies.
7515 2018-09-25 13:37:20 don't know how we pay the bill without increasing taxes and rates. If we pull $ from oil royalties then we have a shortfall somewhere else. reminds me of when i lived in Ontario and McGinty promised no tax increase and introduced health care levy, its not a tax he stated LOL

7519 2018-09-25 13:37:05 This. You want to stop feeding the ‘corporate monsters’... then actually stop giving them money. Ride a bike or walk to work... stop using public transportation except the electric kind.. if everyone did it, then there would be a large reduction in oil drilling and refineries.
7520 2018-09-25 13:36:58 Oil and gas companies rerating across the board yet #Jkx Remains range bound. Expecting quarterly results early October. Could easily transform the outlook of this company 
7521 2018-09-25 13:36:57 I do too. I know the L is pronounced. I just don’t do it. I’ve also received complaints about the way I say oil, mirror, coleslaw, and endless other things from the bf

7526 2018-09-25 13:36:12 It's like you were asking if the oil is oily. WTF. things should be seen by you obviously by now. Dude grow up.
7527 2018-09-25 13:35:34 The breakeven calculation is a discounted cash flow forecast for the next incremental well. This includes the NPV of forecasted cash flows for 30+ years after the well is drilled. That’s very different from the aggregate free cash flow in any given quarter
7528 2018-09-25 13:35:31 That’s a regular refrain I read about Mr. McPhee .... seems to be good at his job !
7529 2018-09-25 13:35:08 They kinda do. Just like if I pay somebody to change my oil. They kind of owe me that service. I don’t need to hear their political views along the way.

7540 2018-09-25 13:33:37 One thing the green movement has helped with is the push for renewable energies, which will create a quite livable future, even when oil starts running out

The rise of recycling technology is also a very good longterm. Developing recycling tech now, leads to better solutions l8r

7543 2018-09-25 13:33:09 Maybe you should report the price of WCS, not a grade of oil, WTI, that Canada doesn’t produce. Then your uninformed readers might clue in to why the Trans Mountain Pipeline is so important to the country.
7544 2018-09-25 13:32:47 Today I made a goal to show more love to my social media accounts and begin to grow my WIR audience. Burning the midnight editing oil is a lonely gig that this introvert prefers, but I'm learning that visibility matters. This is me being accountable to myself.
7545 2018-09-25 13:32:39 @Ritzcrackers Please note I will NOT be purchasing any more of your products until you stop buying palm oil from Wilmar. They are destroying rain forests and the habits of the orang-utan, the health of the planet is not to be substituted for cheap goods!
7546 2018-09-25 13:32:36 Germany is telling workers ‘Show your visa or you will go to jail.’ Workers with passports go back to their home country to apply for visas. YES. This means even those oil workers.... #ItsAboutTimeMerkel #SecureBorder

7673 2018-09-25 13:18:45 It might be an unpopular opinion, but something def feels off about Avenatti. I was glad first his part in bringing Cohen to justice, but now I get a "snake oil salesman" vibe.

7788 2018-09-25 13:09:23 And that's the scary part, especially since there's only one highway to go up there, and it has the fancy moniker of being called Death Highway for a reason. Nobody up there wants oil transported by trucks. Nobody up there wants to see more graves on the side of the road.
7789 2018-09-25 13:09:22 In 1957, Nigeria was the world’s largest palm oil exporter and was responsible for 43% of global palm oil production. In 2018 Nigeria is an importer of palm oil, spending $500 million importing it from Asia. Nigeria must either be restructured, or collapse financially #RenosDarts
7790 2018-09-25 13:09:18 Every 25 seconds a football pitch of forest is lost in Indonesia - and Indigenous People, orangutans and the climate are losing out. A lot of this is because huge areas of forest are cleared to plant the palm trees that produce palm oil. This has to STOP. Stop using palm oil.
7791 2018-09-25 13:09:13 This tweet didn’t age well, as oil prices today hit their highest close since the Fall of 2014.

7793 2018-09-25 13:09:10 I have some CBD oil to try. It’s sold locally so I dunno. Tried a half dose once. Tastes  I’m not against anything that’ll help, yo! Just not in a place to do anything safely or legally right now lol. So I won’t talk about it 
7794 2018-09-25 13:09:09 @Ritzcrackers Drop filthy palm oil and end the destruction of the rain forests NOW!
7795 2018-09-25 13:09:07 I actually don't think the SPV is viable for oil for this reason. But I would emphasize that the it is highly valuable for ensuring that Iran is not dependent on the US to allow for humanitarian trade to actually flow.
7796 2018-09-25 13:09:06 Stop using palm oil from unsustainable sources!!!!
7797 2018-09-25 13:09:05 Texas #1 in Manufacturing. (including oil and gas) Way to go Texas, but had I not read this, I would not have thought of Texas as the #1 manufacturer.
7798 2018-09-25 13:09:00 @Ritzcrackers Stop buying palm oil from companies destroying rainforests.
7799 2018-09-25 13:09:00 There’s kale, raisins, banana, flax oil, sweet potato, and a fat burner in it. On most days, I love it. Yesterday, I hated it. Today, I like it.
7800 2018-09-25 13:08:47 Oil heading to $100 a barrel. Thank you dumbnuts trump.
7801 2018-09-25 13:08:46 How does Andrew Knott see #savp in next 12-18 months?

1 First oil/cash flow in Niger 
2 Find significantly more oil (4 for 4 successful discovery wells so far) + introduce a funding partner
3 Final closure of 7Energy deal in very ST
4 Focus then on consolidating and growing 7E
7802 2018-09-25 13:08:45 And oil and natural gas still receive federal support... some for over 100 years! Ethanol subsidy ended in 2011 and it went to blenders (typically oil companies), not ethanol producers.
7803 2018-09-25 13:08:42 Forecasters see $100 USD barrel of oil by end 2018. (Current Brent price about $80 USD)

Reduction in Venezuelan supply thru mismanagement and Iran thru US sanctions blamed.

This will filter thru to Kenya. Rest assured.

7814 2018-09-25 13:07:48 @narendramodi  Sir you removed subsidies on petroleum products we were fine. Made oil/gas expensive with no option we accepted... But dont you think we should get deliveries in time? A taxpayer leaving eveything is waiting for GAS refill from Morning and agents are enjoying...

7816 2018-09-25 13:07:47 Please stop buying palm oil from companies destroying rainforests. I understand from a recent Greenpeace article that Colgate is still using palm oil supplied by Wilmar, the dirtiest palm oil giant and single biggest threat to Indonesian rainforests.
7817 2018-09-25 13:07:46 Make friend with Hassan instead war. He is a good man and not racist. Only propaganda and fakenews of Democrat Administration ruin the reputation of Iran. I know people live in Iran and they are very kind people. Don't destroy Iran Nuclear they used it to liberated Iran from oil
7818 2018-09-25 13:07:43 And they want to keep their jobs because the people in the oil sands literally dedicate their lives to that job. Schools, the hospital, community projects all rely on the oil sands. They live, breathe and die in the oil sands. The pipeline could become their lifeline.

7821 2018-09-25 13:07:23 @RitzCrackers is one of the brands that are still buying dirty palm oil from rainforest destroyers! The first step to stop deforestation is to stop working with companies like Wilmar. #DropDirtyPalmOi
7822 2018-09-25 13:07:07 And @HassanRouhani and his regime of 4 decades have plundered #Iranian national resources (#oil, #water, #fish, and minerals) to finance & promote their version of #Islam through extreme acts of #violence and #terrorism.

7830 2018-09-25 13:05:57 I can tell you that a lot of people in Alberta, especially in the oil sands are divided by the pipeline issue. Some people here want to open up refineries here so more jobs open up, while others want the pipeline so that they can keep their jobs.

7850 2018-09-25 13:03:54 Let us say that a European oil company receives Iranian oil but does not have an active NDAA exception. Under EO 13622 -- which Treasury is purportedly prepared to reimpose -- that acquisition of Iranian oil is itself sanctionable.  The breach is in the acquisition.

7856 2018-09-25 13:03:29 Scottish Beef & Irish are very good as is Welsh Lamb. Occasionally, it is best to use the best ingredients you can. On TV Cookery shows, like Masterchef, that is almost always the case. Stir fries (woked,) with just a tiny amount of first-press virgin olive oil are very healthy.
7857 2018-09-25 13:03:21 Thank you!! I just threw some veggies on a sheet pan with avocado oil, salt and pepper, then scrambled eggs and made a couple of patties of chicken apple breakfast sausage. Topped it with Trader Joe’s Everything But the Bagel seasoning, which is SO GOOD!
7858 2018-09-25 13:03:15 If there's an equilibrium price for oil (i.e. the price at which the federal budget is in balance), there must be an equilibrium production rate.

Our current 1.7mbd is clearly way below that level.

7895 2018-09-25 12:58:17 If we go as per the technicals, lower band of $70 holding support will give the momentum for $97, the upper band for Crude oil. OPEC will relax the prices at $100. Same for the rupee. Lower band of 71 gives the momentum for 74. Every 1% drop in USD rises Crude price by 0.73%.

7905 2018-09-25 12:57:02 OIL: The oil price shot to its highest in four years catapulted by upcoming U.S. sanctions on Iranian crude exports and the apparent reluctance of OPEC and Russia to raise output to offset the potential hit to global supply.

8009 2018-09-25 12:43:59 If humans can refreeze permafrost to stabilize oil wells, why not attempt refreezing these lakes?

Vent some methane & combust it to power refrigeration & convert to CO2.

Or what about those Alaskan ethanol boiling permafrost stabilizers?

8010 2018-09-25 12:43:55 The draft revised energy strategy of @EBRD is out today, and it doesn't even match the World Bank Group's limits on oil and gas finance.

8058 2018-09-25 12:39:46 Of all the fats, coconut or MCT oil is probably the only one to have a thermic effect similar to protein. Just eating it helps your body burn more calories and is utilized as energy as opposed to heading straight to fat storage. #weightloss #fatloss #health …

8061 2018-09-25 12:39:27 Crude #oil prices have jumped to the highest level since November 2014 as key producers like Russia and OPEC are not increasing production, while #Iran will soon be hit by US sanctions on its energy industry.

8074 2018-09-25 12:38:11 Yes but there are opposite studies. Same as with $AMRN's drug, in fact (there's also a study claiming little effect). The same goes for fish oil (supportive and non-supportive studies exist)

Today, activists are occupying Wilmar's palm oil refinery in Indonesia. They're sending a message to  Ritz Crackers - stop buying palm oil from companies destroying rainforests. The biggest threat to Indonesian rainforests - Wilmar. Did you promise to cut ties ???
8077 2018-09-25 12:37:54 Please cut off Wilmar, who you`ve been buying dirty palm oil from for years and start using sustainable palm oil to stop destroying rainforests and its habitants!

8092 2018-09-25 12:35:51 There are many powerful Crypto Jewish politicians in Kurdistan. The first tanker of ISIS oil was sold to Isreal. Who was the first female rabii in the world?  A Kurdish one.
8093 2018-09-25 12:35:47 Actually maybe you should learn some history Iran has a legitimate beef with the US. The US killed a democratically elected progressive leader and installed the brutal Shah just so western oil companies could rip them off.
8094 2018-09-25 12:35:41 @Ritzcrackers Please drop Wilmar, who are destroying the rainforest by extracting palm oil
8095 2018-09-25 12:35:35 @Ritzcrackers Please drop dirty palm oil and help to end forest destruction.
8096 2018-09-25 12:35:33 Evidence that what we do or do not do has little influence on the numbers. I just wish the real movers of this world i.e. the US, Europe, China as well as the oil cartels can just sit down and hammer out a fair trade deal for all.

8100 2018-09-25 12:35:22 Even if that means utter financial destruction? Even if it means no oil? Even if it means no trade with 27 of the top 35 economies? Even if it means no trade with a further 60 countries? The notices going out from HMC are all about that. Not how to cope, but it will happen

8107 2018-09-25 12:34:55 @Ritzcrackers You promised no deforestation palm oil by 2020 but you're way off target.  You need to take a huge step. You need to drop Wilmar! We're WATCHING

8161 2018-09-25 12:28:06 Yet the demand for oil is going down...high prices could just be down due to less production, inflation, increased tarriffs or poor pricing. Means nothing in it's true sense...important to ask why Goldmann sachs and the rothchilds do this?

8178 2018-09-25 12:26:33 Trump's attempt to prevent Iran from selling oil and trading internationally may be very costly to US. The EU, China, Russia, Iran and other countries plan to set up an international trading market that replaces $ denomination and US influence. Remember 1974 oil prices?
Smart!

8209 2018-09-25 12:22:52 Have you tried tea tree oil?? It’s so incredible for your skin! They have face wash with tea tree in it but sometimes putting a little straight up on to pimples or dark spots really helps!

8221 2018-09-25 12:21:42 I made my own.  It's just tea tree oil in water.  Apparently they don't like the smell.  An Aussie friend told me that's what they do and it works for them.  There is a spray you can buy but I find it hard to come by so use this as an alternative.
8222 2018-09-25 12:21:40 It makes sense to the lobbyist who bribed the trump administration to eliminate the rule. Safety should not be the primary concern when transporting crude oil. Lmao #DumpTrump #Impeach45

8230 2018-09-25 12:20:39 @Ritzcrackers Stop working with companies that are DESTROYING rainforests to produce dirty palm oil.  We know the importance of rainforests. Your crackers can be replaced but the rainforests cannot.
8231 2018-09-25 12:20:32 I'm still confused why we do this paranoid Kleptocracy with nowt but a bit of oil to its name, the dignity of pretending it's some behemoth bestriding the globe, when the reality is that it's a fairky shonky global power which tends to back off when pushed back

8235 2018-09-25 12:20:10 Today a Chinese rep in APPEC event in Singapore said Asia's demand for US crude is a long term one. One funny thing is when all the oil traders congregate in one place the crude price spike.

8289 2018-09-25 12:13:37 Agreed, foliage feeding is very inefficient, especially in a dry climate. Fertigation is much better. Back on the real topic though, does snake oil remove indiscriminately daubed tar?
8290 2018-09-25 12:13:26 Remember to add fats: olive oil, cream, butter, ghee, cheese, avocado.
8291 2018-09-25 12:13:25 How was Afghanistan an enemy? What army? What technology? Or Iraq at that time? Or Libia? Your logic is flawed. Try oil. And poppy seeds as real motiveS. American soldiers died in vein there for money and oil interests. Not for political gain of any nation, be it Israel or the US

8300 2018-09-25 12:12:16 @Ritzcrackers  RITZ! Stop supporting Wilmar's palm oil refinery in Indonesia! Do not buy palm oil from companies destroying rainforests. DROP the dirtiest palm oil giant & single biggest threat to Indonesian rainforests - Wilmar. The world is watching!

8307 2018-09-25 12:11:19 @Ritzcrackers #Ritzcrackers I have stopped buying Ritz Crackers because I think that they contain palm oil from #Wilmar, which is destroying the rainforest in Indonesia. When you can reassure me that they do not contain this palm oil, I will start buying them again.

8332 2018-09-25 12:07:52 @dove Stop buying palm oil from Wilmar's refinery. The earth needs its rainforest - I'm sure your customers would prefer you to come up with an alternative to palm oil so that countless animals and plants can be saved.
8333 2018-09-25 12:07:46 I tried cleansing balm and I dont really fond of the aftermath tho.. somehow clogged my pores hahah I’ve been using cleansing oil for quite some time already and it’s good but I think it’s just immune to the formula. I need a change of product 
8334 2018-09-25 12:07:40 Baby oil?
8335 2018-09-25 12:07:40 Yeah citronella is great, but then again, if the Soil you culitivate, is fed, instead of foliage feeding which is most inefficient, then soil biomes/biota produces healthy plants. No need for snake oil at all!
8336 2018-09-25 12:07:38 Cut into steaks 1 inch thick....make a marinade with olive oil, garlic, lime juice, lime zest, salt, pepper, oregano, marinate 24 hours, grill to medium rare.....set aside to rest....throw away and order chinese

8341 2018-09-25 12:07:28 #PalmOil is causing havoc to Indonesian forests & wildlife. @PepsiCo is fuelling this, through business partnership with one of the industry’s worst offenders @Indofood. RT to join me in calling on CEO @IndraNooyi to end Pepsi’s palm oil crimes

8346 2018-09-25 12:07:09 The Hamburg District is ditching on Versailles Plank Road, hot patching on Backcreek Road and sweeping oil and chip roads.
8347 2018-09-25 12:07:07 Obviously yourba weather man and not a market forecaster

Here's one high to high oil was 6 mo 6 days. Low was same weeks as price 26.06 2/11/16 at 2:38 pm

Seems macro biotic to me

8349 2018-09-25 12:06:53 Better option use Cannabidiol or CBD oil as supplements

8353 2018-09-25 12:05:57 @Ritzcrackers how about you drop dirty palm oil and end forest destruction?
8354 2018-09-25 12:05:55 So baby oil isn't really for babies now huh..
8355 2018-09-25 12:05:39 @MornflakeCereal Whilst I love your No Added Sugar Granola, I don’t love the fact it has palm oil listed in its ingredients. There is no information about the sourcing of this this ingredient on your website, so I won’t be buying this product again. @wwf_uk #palmoil
8356 2018-09-25 12:05:36 Don't know if you've made it, but Dan Dan sauce looks awful and is vegan; stock, tahini, aminos, chilli oil, agave, 5 spice, vinegar. I mess around with the quantities a lot, but the only constant is not to overdo the 5 spice.
8357 2018-09-25 12:05:32 MAYBE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THE PINK ONE, THE TASTE IS GOOD IF YOU GET OVER THE SPICINESS TBH. ALSO LIKE IF YOU DRIZZLE SOME OIL, THE SPICINESS DECREASES-- or mayo but that will change the taste a lil. Yuka Kinoshita has tried the pink one ww
8358 2018-09-25 12:05:19 This will be so useful to me, no longer will i have to wright in the dark or have to worry about the oil lamp burning out.
8359 2018-09-25 12:05:19 U know lvl one would be an oil change, and if u don't have gloves your cancer meter creeps up, and your experience dictates how well you can handle a wrench to prevent slip-offs and busted knuckles.

8363 2018-09-25 12:04:46 That's my Sophie that is.  I am glowing in Granny dom.  Our children are our millionaires.  Such pride and confidence, and all for free
8364 2018-09-25 12:04:33 That was one of those “I remember where I was” moments.
8365 2018-09-25 12:04:23 The oil inside condom is it Kings oil or power oil?
8366 2018-09-25 12:04:16 Well for the sake of your countries economy you best hope that oil doesn’t become a third rate commodity! We can only subsidise you for so long 
8367 2018-09-25 12:04:06 there is a lot of US debt collateralized by cracked oil...gotta keep it looking good.

8371 2018-09-25 12:03:44 @Ritzcrackers Please stop buying palm oil from companies destroying rainforests and do what you need to... drop the dirtiest palm oil giant and single biggest threat to Indonesian rainforests! Thanks!
8372 2018-09-25 12:03:36 Cheers, i wouldnt expect US oil production to rise over 18mbpd at any point. Horizontal well production rates decay much faster than most investors realize and rates for financing new projects wil be significantly higher in 2020 & beyond

8386 2018-09-25 12:02:08 कौन सी बात ? Crude oil above $81/bbl. Forget any signs of upside for few days. Temporary upside not countable. और शेयर बाज़ार किसी भी देश के विकास का पैमाना नहीं होता। पाकिस्तान में 48000 से ऊपर है और ब्राज़ील में 75000 से ऊपर। पढ लीजिए कि दोनों देशों के हालात क्या हैं।
8387 2018-09-25 12:01:55 we have plenty of crude oil. The push for E-15 is 100% greed. Maybe Americans dont know of all the extra money the oil cos get for just mixing ethonol & China controlls the majority of our food so its a Trojan horse
8388 2018-09-25 12:01:52 The Illuminati run the world WAKE UP, IT’S BREAKFAST TIME!  Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil! Most clowns are just NSA spies in disguise! Never speak secrets to clowns!
8389 2018-09-25 12:01:40 You’re right we have the actual data showing Scotland to be the only country to have found oil and gotten poorer. What happened to all the actual money Duncan?
8390 2018-09-25 12:01:37 The destructive force at work for palm oil - STOP the dirty, destructive practices of @Ritzcrackers @Dove and @Colgate @KITKAT @Doritos @KelloggsUS and support @Greenpeace in their campaign

8398 2018-09-25 12:00:25 @Ritzcrackers stop buying palm oil from companies destroying rainforests, you don't need too, Think of all the wild life they have wiped out, have you even seen the size of the rainforest they destroyed so far. Or just sit here & ignore it because it doesn't effect you ?.
8399 2018-09-25 12:00:18 Oil creates inflation AND the tariffs and higher prices for wages r not a small thing.
8400 2018-09-25 12:00:07 @Ritzcrackers STOP WITH PALM OIL NOW!

8403 2018-09-25 11:59:34 And I would be disrespecting my dead friend if I supported a party backing Isis/al musta front et al in regime changing proxy wars. Just so we can control the narrative and the oil. So in effect I've no choice to vote for anti-imperialism out of respect

8408 2018-09-25 11:58:57 They sell it at clicks but it stimulates the scalp more than normal shampoo and conditioner so it promotes growth... Also saw that black castor oil works similarly if you rub it on your head 2-3 times a week
8409 2018-09-25 11:58:56 First it was better opposition, then young players not getting chances, then oil money.
 English players are average, management can't even get a POINT against a half decent team. Its shambolic. 

I look back thinking the state of me being jubilant after beating COLUMBIA on pens
8410 2018-09-25 11:58:43 @exxonmobil why is the current price for petrol 168c per litre? Singapore Crude Oil is $98 per barrel. It was the same in 2008. #auspol
8411 2018-09-25 11:58:37 Shut the door!
8412 2018-09-25 11:58:34 I've said it all along. Proceed with caution with snake oil salesmen like #MorningJoe. Calling credible women telling their stories "unprecedented attacks" on Kavanaugh tells us everything we need to know about @JoeNBC & @morningmika. #posers
8413 2018-09-25 11:58:34 Again, Twitter is under no obligation - either legally or otherwise - to allow idiots like Jimmy Wood or the entire Trump family to peddle their bullshit. They could suspend you, #DotardDonnieJr, for having too much oil in your hair if they wanted. Don't like it? Leave.
8414 2018-09-25 11:58:18 Love me some Jackhammer sweeps and also the fararm shotty playing oil depot or shuttle
8415 2018-09-25 11:58:17 Did you know that Pepsi has a palm oil problem? I want @IndraNooyi, the CEO of @PepsiCo to take responsibility for destroying #orangutans precious rainforest home and end her deals with dodgy #palmoil company @Indofood today!
8416 2018-09-25 11:58:15 Flashbacks Japan went to war when the allies cut off rubber,oil and other raw materials to the point of extreme hardship. Trump’s plan looks very similar and he’s acting like an aggressive emperor, be warned, =
8417 2018-09-25 11:58:08 Please stop using palm oil and that will stop the destruction of forests
8418 2018-09-25 11:58:07 Gue seneng bgt kalo bersihin makeup pake cleansing oil setelahnya lgsg mulus gimana gt mukanya. Berasa mirip galgadot gimana gidu
8419 2018-09-25 11:57:58 So Kenya is working on how to export crude oil the spend the money buying oil products like bitumen? Can't we just refine and utilize our own oil?

8422 2018-09-25 11:57:34 Two oil Labs six to 7 months apart so far, and so far perfectly healthy for my car. Let's see how much farther she can go. @BlackstoneLabs1
8423 2018-09-25 11:57:28 I was checking the oil in my car and as I closed the bonnet a random old woman went “well done, bet your dad told you how to do that” and I just laughed and went “yeah...haha” completely forgetting I don’t have a dad sjdjjdjdjdjdjd
8424 2018-09-25 11:57:26 Throughout Asia. There is no justification whatever for oil at this price level. It's shameless & short-sighted extraction of economic rent by greedy producers. I think China is preparing to pull liquidity from an entirely #FakeMarket supported by Saudi capital with Fed liquidity
8425 2018-09-25 11:57:22 I love that I can go from debating free speech, oil drilling and our housing crisis one night, to screaming, laughing and clapping at one of the best drag queens. Love you Auckland
8426 2018-09-25 11:57:07 I put oil fry the rice till it’s a lil brown, cut some tomato onion, add water, add 2 squares the tomato & chicken flavor. Let that cook on it’s own. Don’t stir a lot & use a fork if you’re gonna be checking so it doesn’t get all soft.

8432 2018-09-25 11:56:28 We need fossil fuel emissions to peak now and reduce rapidly. However, -ve emissions/CDR methods may have adverse effects or be ineffective, and may also become excuse to delay phasing out coal/oil/gas.

I think Lenzi et al is an example of concerns that *should* be mainstream.

8439 2018-09-25 11:55:22 Work out the quantity of clean water being poured and flushed on vehicles. This is one aspect. What quality of water they r discharging is hilarious, clean water is full of oil & grease, high content of BoD and CoD with other toxic chemicals and pollutants . No Petrol pump...
8440 2018-09-25 11:55:16 @Ritzcrackers stop using palm oil in your products!
8441 2018-09-25 11:55:10 @Ritzcrackers Please stop buying your palm oil from companies who destroy the rainforest to fill your orders.
8442 2018-09-25 11:55:02 Your delusions are running wild again the Iranian President has already said he won’t meet with you. You have been provoking Iran since you announced your candidacy. You have made it clear you want there oil and all other assets.

8446 2018-09-25 11:54:14 Wehdon Ma, bcos I'm not selling Saraki's snake oil makes me sound ludicrous. Nigerians know that Saraki's desperate ideology of d end justifies d means has nothing in it 4 them. Even Kwarans ar in d process of dislodging his hegemony that chained their state to d ground
8447 2018-09-25 11:54:11 @Ritzcrackers The makers of Colgate, Dove and Ritz Crackers promised no deforestation palm oil by 2020 but they're way off target. 
8448 2018-09-25 11:54:04 Mineral oil
8449 2018-09-25 11:54:01 Actually most electricity comes from nature. Sun, wind,water. Tesla is working on all their chargers being fully solar. Shipping oil all over the world is more unsafe for the environment. Look at the oil spills in oceans and train tanker and truck accidents
8450 2018-09-25 11:53:59 Well the East Coast needs to get oil from somewhere . We all know the Libs like SA more than AB & SK. Energy East aside, that’s a given.
8451 2018-09-25 11:53:47 Of course!
No one knows who Scheer is and those that do, don't know that they will be voting for the same Lib 2.0.
Most Conservatives are complaining about the SM, freedom of speech, equalization, immigration, oil, guns, NAFTA etc, and CPC (Scheer) will not touch any of that.

8457 2018-09-25 11:53:00 Basically they saying he's a shit leader and Canada got enough problems to deal with, like some oil pipeline he building and illegal immigration, that are far more important than having meetings with leaders from nations that don't matter

I think because the niggas spend so much time away from home they need to cover their insecurities with over-the-top miso(i won't even say the word before all sorts of people jump into my mentions)

8467 2018-09-25 11:52:06 The makers of Colgate, Dove and Ritz Crackers promised no deforestation palm oil by 2020 but they're way off target. 
8468 2018-09-25 11:52:02 Chahar thinks there is an oil bed beneath the pitch, that's why bowling extras again & again.
#INDvAFG
8469 2018-09-25 11:51:52 @Ritzcrackers terrible that you’re complicit in the use of palm oil grown from deforested land in Indonesia. I shall #boycotritz henceforth.
8470 2018-09-25 11:51:47 Venta Maersk is nothing like those heavily-reinforced icebreaking tankers transporting Arctic oil and gas. It's essentially an open water vessel with few extra millimetres of steel and the propulsion power is actually relatively low for such a large ship.
8471 2018-09-25 11:51:30 Deepak Chahar wants to get the oil out of the pitch. FHL #INDvAFG
8472 2018-09-25 11:51:21 The McCrone report was a collation of publicly available data showing predictions for oil revenues in 1974. We have the *actual* data now. The McCrone report is *entirely* irrelevant to the question today of which parts of the UK benefit and which contribute.
8473 2018-09-25 11:51:15 convert to renewable energy ?& we'll have less wars for oil #Lab2018 #lab18 #LabourConference2018
8474 2018-09-25 11:51:09 Yes and I understand this is where some of current EU-US discussion is focused. But what reliable normal payment mechanisms exist in Europe? Could SPV be used for that? @FedericaMog spoke of oil import money though. That seems unlikely.

8477 2018-09-25 11:51:04 This is about maintaining Wall Street/Big Oil control of global pricing at all costs.

8483 2018-09-25 11:50:12 You’re missing the whole point...until the party in opposition actually  acknowledges good things the ruling government is doing we’ll always have this back and forth about who was worse...you’re talking about the bauxite but you forgot we don’t even own the oil we produce.
8484 2018-09-25 11:50:08 【ad】Few things are as versatile as our oil. "Oilmighty" can use for cooking, gear and even lubricant for your relationship!
8485 2018-09-25 11:49:49 @WWWMovement - Like Oil, is getting me through this gym session. 
8486 2018-09-25 11:49:45 more bluster from politicians.  Meanwhile EU companies continue to severe business ties and cease Iran oil purchases.

8488 2018-09-25 11:49:42 @Ritzcrackers Every 25 seconds a football pitch of forest is lost in Indonesia to produce 'dirty' palm oil used in your product. You need to take a huge step, drop Wilmar & use only sustainable palm oil. Protect Orang Utans not kill them!
8489 2018-09-25 11:49:33 I am seeing oil prices and rupee rate against dollar at Rs. 100.

8491 2018-09-25 11:49:10 RT MRomahurmuziy: Hingga 2030 Negara Eropa masih memakai sawit sebagai sumber energi alternatif biodiesel dalam rencana jangka panjang pengembangan energinya. PPP berkomitmen mendorong industri sawit yang memperhatikan kualitas lingkungan (sustainable palm oil development).
8492 2018-09-25 11:49:10 @Ritzcrackers No more palm oil
8493 2018-09-25 11:48:57 @narendramodi Sir, We urgently need to arrest the runaway slide of the Rupee, thru issue of forex bonds, procuring oil from Iran ignoring the US embargo, etc., before it is too late.
8494 2018-09-25 11:48:57 I forgot I scheduled an oil change for tonight at 10 
8495 2018-09-25 11:48:50 Anyone who can afford $1m+ super cars can afford $20,000 oil change and have multiple super cars. They don’t care if they don’t have the car for a month. I guess you wouldn’t know since you’re not that rich.
8496 2018-09-25 11:48:39 I can't afford the life saving cannabis I need. My chronic illnesses prevent me from doing normal daily activities. I could be working, I could be productive w/cannabis oil but OW/ODSP won't cover my legal cannabis prescription but they will pay for me to be a zombie on opioids
8497 2018-09-25 11:48:30 I've put about 20 more hours into the game and just now got to the Oil Fields.
8498 2018-09-25 11:48:24 I’m assuming better HP performance in Northeast is due to higher heating demand, use of fuel oil for heating, and low coal on grid.  Are those safe assumptions, or am I missing something?
8499 2018-09-25 11:48:22 The company needs to stop destroying the forests for palm oil! It is disgraceful it is not acting more responsibly COLGATE- SHAME ON THIS COMPANY. I am boycotting all its products and will make it my business to tell others to do the same until it changes its policies Disgusting
8500 2018-09-25 11:48:20 .@Ritzcrackers COME ON! Drop dirty palm oil. You are responsible - so please act
#PalmOil #Greenpeace is watching
8501 2018-09-25 11:48:09 @Ritzcrackers please stop buying palm oil from wilmar refinery, we need to preserve our forests!
8502 2018-09-25 11:48:04 How did you pass Oil Well Simulation?

Considering Conservation of Mass - The man has distinguished himself in the short period in the Senate, hence performance is guaranteed.

Considering Isothermal fluid phase behaviour - He is in good company, he will not appoint ghost.
8503 2018-09-25 11:47:51 Also, even at a country level, runaway wildfires and tens of billions in environmental costs for abandoned oil wells are not so desirable, even if, for a time, some area former ski resorts become wine producers.
8504 2018-09-25 11:47:48 You can totally tell it was done on a stage in Hollywood. I’ve look through Bruce Willis’ IMDb and it doesn’t mention worked on a ocean oil platform at all. Nice try.

8523 2018-09-25 11:46:24 @RitzCrackers is one of the brands that are still buying dirty palm oil from rainforest destroyers! The first step to stop deforestation is to stop working with companies like Wilmar. #DropDirtyPalmOi
8524 2018-09-25 11:46:04 agree on all points.  Downside if it proves to be only temp solution and oil prices remain higher for longer, India will have exacerbated their problem and be forced to replenish stocks at even higher prices.

8534 2018-09-25 11:44:46 Thanks to the Trump attack on Iran, the price of oil rose from $ 55 to $ 80 thousand. E. by 45%.
Iranian oil exports fell to the average value of the first half of 2018. by 30%.
Ie, in the revenue, Iran has not lost.

8536 2018-09-25 11:44:35 Despite a recent rise in wholesale oil costs the price per barrel is only fractionally higher than 3 months ago but I’m sure the forecourts will increase fuel prices exponentially & we will continue to be ripped off. Please, someone, end this unfairness NOW!

8549 2018-09-25 11:43:02 Except this time market tightness stems from self-inflicted supply losses resulting from US policy choices, despite evidence to contrary & opposed by rest of P5+1. And despite provisions in the sanctions law to avoid this kind of oil price reaction through more gradual reductions
8550 2018-09-25 11:42:46 'All factions of the US political and military-intelligence establishment share the objective of subjugating Iran and ensuring US hegemony over the Middle East, both because of its oil wealth and geostrategic importance .....'

8600 2018-09-25 11:36:56 Some days I identify as a rich oil tycoon. It's really disappointing when friends and family explain that I'm simply fantasising.
8601 2018-09-25 11:36:53 M7: "The oil is ready, what remains to be tested is the preparedness & readiness of y'all & most especially the East Africans."

People power: Tubikwase Kyagulanyi. 

Me: With oil, Sevo is to rewind the time machine & start counting again. Buckle up!
8602 2018-09-25 11:36:53 Thanks I will check this out later. I either watch @MSNBC  on my phone or listen on tune in radio.  Different ads... no big pharma, big oil or political ads.

8607 2018-09-25 11:36:26 Three of Vestas' four Colorado manufacturing plants are located in Weld County so it makes sense that they would employ more people than oil/gas industry.   At least you're honest about wanting to drive the oil & gas industry out of Colorado.
8608 2018-09-25 11:36:22 .@Ritzcrackers, drop dirty palm oil and end forest destruction.

8625 2018-09-25 11:34:29 @paragkhanna My prognosis about the Russian Federation is not positive: Permafrost will melt. Siberians will want to be independent (their oil, gas, water, minerals) and separate. End to colonial times, for Russia too.

8658 2018-09-25 11:30:12 Yes there is. The OTC fish oil on my kitchen counter has 360 milligrams of pufas per gram of oil. This is 4 g purified pufa, specifically EPA. It is fish oil, but it’s different from the otc versions. Given the number of fish oil studies that have failed, that may matter.
8659 2018-09-25 11:30:10 oil leaks and harmful boat cleaning agents are bad for our water. boat sustainably!
8660 2018-09-25 11:29:42 Don't quite know what the answer is actually in 'white' terms. The original folk, 'the Aboriginals', didn't eat sugar. Bush tucker, was oil based. Perhaps that's why they lasted for 60,000 years?

8668 2018-09-25 11:28:44 @Ritzcrackers Please stop using palm oil from endangered forests. It's not necessary and it's helping to wipe out large areas of forest which are needed to support both human and animal life.

Oil money has made the standard of the prem better which should have a trickle down affect.

However, oil money didn’t affect Eng teams between 66 & 2002.
8674 2018-09-25 11:27:59 Will have to see full results @American_Heart

for a therapy tested in an RCT, success depends on

*right patients

8727 2018-09-25 11:22:32 Can’t blame OPEC/Russia, they need to build market share at the expense of Iran. US-Sino trade war could escalate & thence begins to threaten the global economy.

8737 2018-09-25 11:21:54 I mean to me, even Chels' ownership by a guy who stole the oil of a whole country and sold it off(leaving the russian population poor) is better than being owned by a warmongering and human rights-abusing dictatorship ala Qatar(same deal as City basically). There's levels to it.
8738 2018-09-25 11:21:38 A surge in crude oil prices to $81 a barrel - past its 2014 highs - along with strength in the dollar overseas battered the rupee. The currency is down more than 13 per cent against the dollar so far this year.

8764 2018-09-25 11:19:51 Brent crude hit another four-year high of 81,9 dollar a barrel Tuesday amid looming US sanctions on #Iran's oil exports and after news that #OPEC leaders and #Russia ruled against an increase in production notwithstanding #DonaldTrump calls for action to calm the price.

8773 2018-09-25 11:19:14 Obviamente, la honestidad es un requisito, de acuerdo ahi. Pero además de un persona honesta se requiere un tecnico que conozca y entienda como opera el mundo del oil&gas.
8774 2018-09-25 11:18:45 And he can shut down the route for oil to be exported, maybe be an adult and sit down with him

8777 2018-09-25 11:18:02 Lebanon Is already Bankrupt, And has been selling its Oil and gas reserves before drilling since 1992.
8778 2018-09-25 11:17:51 Make America Not So Great Again and make average Americans pay MORE for gas enriching the Big Oil companies even more and giving their billionaire owners tax breaks...
8779 2018-09-25 11:17:48 The trick to making it this awesome is to cook the tofu mince in the oil that comes off the chorizo.
8780 2018-09-25 11:17:47 One small question to you regarding crude. Suppose we ignore US sanctions and start buying oil from Iran by paying in rupees will that be a game changer

8782 2018-09-25 11:17:29 Oil is now at $82 per barrel, the highest it has been in four years? All motorists continue to contribute to the hedge fund but the money is not being spent on hedging. Where is Carolyn Gomes and others to rally the troop at the foot of Jack's Hill?

8788 2018-09-25 11:16:33 Regions where drilling of oil and gas is happening will benefit from 5% allocated to them, get a share of 70% (National G); 20% (County Government share) and most of these areas are benefiting from Equalization Fund.

8790 2018-09-25 11:16:22 So. You’re deliberately avoiding mentioning the OPEC oil embargo in October 1973, which triggered a global recession. Or the coal strike and 3 day week that followed directly after. They’d have nothing to do with growth collapsing? Just blame the EU.
8791 2018-09-25 11:16:22 Is there some sort of mist happening outside, or are the highways secreting oil?  Total Traffic is reporting three accidents that have stopped traffic, which is a little unusual at this early hour.  Drive safely out there, folks.

8798 2018-09-25 11:15:50 India 83% crude oil import karta hai. Aur india ke pas crude oil ka koy source nahi hai. Aur ab to Trump ji ne import par tax bhi badha diya hai.
Aur petrol ki price badhne kuch nayi baat nahi hai. BJP aane se increase rate pehle se kam ho gaya hai. Aap data dekh lo .

8800 2018-09-25 11:15:43 Exactly.  Two other effects.  

1. the symbolism here is probably Europe's most important contribution, and it may be sufficient depending on what China, India, Turkey do on oil.  

2. the payment mechanism move opens the door to a longer-term degradation of US sanctions power.

8815 2018-09-25 11:13:37 IMO, analysys of subsidy reform needs a simple framing that activists and the public can be energized by.

@SEI_Erickson et al. study showing 1/2 of US oil is unprofitable without subsidies might be an example.
8816 2018-09-25 11:13:27 Oil prices hit fresh four-year high above $82 but the Westminster Tory government still leaves Petroleum Revenue Tax at 0%. We are literally pouring tax revenues into the pockets of the oil and gas multinationals.

8826 2018-09-25 11:12:30 Richard, LWCF funded by US oil lease revenues.  Yet, nearly every year, Congress breaks its own promise to the American people and diverts much of this funding to uses other than conserving our most important lands and waters.

8877 2018-09-25 11:07:06 10 years ago, Foden would be playing every week. Oil money means he’s sat on a bench every week and only getting 10 minutes here and there. That’s not Southgate’s fault. That’s not Foden’s fault.

8880 2018-09-25 11:06:17 .@Ritzcrackers Every 25 seconds a football pitch of forest is lost in Indonesia - and Indigenous People, orangutans & the climate are losing out. Lot of this is because huge areas of forest are cleared to plant the palm trees that produce palm oil. 
This is way off your 2020 aim

8972 2018-09-25 10:52:19 4/4 It takes the crushing of olives to get the oil out, and the crushing of grapes to get the fruit of the vine out. So we have to be crushed to release the oil of the anointing and fruit of the Spirit.

The oil price is on course for its fifth consecutive quarterly…
9257 2018-09-25 10:13:16 The Oil price has hit a four-year high of over $81 a barrel, so expect a higher petrol  hike in SA in October . Government is unlikely to absorb the hike next month as it did for the September. Rand remains weak against the dollar, but 14:40 is still better 15:42 on Sept 5.

9435 2018-09-25 09:46:38 @Ritzcrackers Stop using dirty palm oil.......we want stop until you do
9436 2018-09-25 09:46:37 Il ne faut pas les réguler. Il faut les réguler ET les démanteler comme ce fut fait en son temps pour la standard oil. En faire des structures plus petites, moins puissantes, en séparant certaines de leurs activités
9437 2018-09-25 09:46:31 Crude Oil is now $81 per barrel. The highest since 2014.
9438 2018-09-25 09:46:25 Do you ever feel so scared that you just can't move? I like to call it my 'rabbit in headlights' feeling. I've been feeling that way this week. I have lots to do, but I feel caught in headlights. I've taken some CBD oil this morning to help, but what do you do when feel this way?
9439 2018-09-25 09:46:22 Oil short gone wrong?
9440 2018-09-25 09:46:12 cut all the ties you have with wilmars palm oil refinery#stop deforestation@Ritzcrackers
9441 2018-09-25 09:46:10 i mean how important can an oil change really be
9442 2018-09-25 09:46:05 Ritz Crackers - stop using palm oil from Wilmar. You are destroying rain forest.
9443 2018-09-25 09:46:00 Coz this is related to mostly COAL pollution based, OIL & GAS to be imported base power.
My take was to have clean power, not to build Micro's only.

The biggest problem is thinking it local but not global by so called Sharif's.

9450 2018-09-25 09:44:40 @Ritzcrackers I understand you use unsustainable palm oil in your crackers.  This is not acceptable.  What's going on?
9451 2018-09-25 09:44:34 How are the charging stations using oil and gas?! It's either solar, coal or nuclear.
9452 2018-09-25 09:44:33 @SCOTSANGEL1 I think Scotland should have been given independence as soon as oil was found Imagine if investment had started then? In infrastructure, education, health? But sadly oil will never be allowed out of control  of oligarchs! As Seen in Venezuela!!

9458 2018-09-25 09:43:31 Thanks to fracking there's actually a ton of local oil. Crude oil is like the life blood of the earth,  it is not from "fossils" and it will never run out.

9469 2018-09-25 09:42:42 Compressor is filled with oil which is impt to its operation
In upright position gravity keeps oil in compressor
When refrigerator is flat oil can leave compressor & into cooling lines
Can clog  cooling lines & damage them
Lack of oil in compressor can also damage the compressor

9477 2018-09-25 09:42:08 @Ritzcrackers Please stop buying palm oil from companies destroying rainforests. To do that you need to drop the dirtiest palm oil giant and single biggest threat to Indonesian rainforests - Wilmar.
9478 2018-09-25 09:41:55 GLD lost around 45 tonnes of Gold in Aug, only around 4 tonnes in Sept as the USD price has stabalised.  The fun starts IMHO, when Western investors start buying and the GLD needs to re-stock; how will that look if a decent percent of CNY OIL is being exchanged for Gold.
9479 2018-09-25 09:41:54 Drop dirty palm oil and stop destroying the rain forest please

9489 2018-09-25 09:40:41 I hope that's because those countries won't accept products made with rainforest destroying palm oil!
9490 2018-09-25 09:40:36 So its still clear that 5% owns the only economic thrust of the country. Even with the increase and the borrowing the poverty, joblessness, hunger death is increasing with the oil prices

9575 2018-09-25 09:29:01 "Oil" is the favorite word of people building online dating profiles in the U.S. states of Texas, Oklahoma, and North Dakota.
9576 2018-09-25 09:28:59 Ask the common citizens this question 1st. Revenue collected from Fuel is again used for Nation's growth. Price hike is linked with Int'n market. Crude production is managed by oil Cartel OPEC which manipulate prices. Also recent ban crude production on Iran/Venezuela by US.

9581 2018-09-25 09:28:30 @Ritzcrackers Time to stop buying dirty palm oil from Wilmar and remember your customers need a planet to live on.......never mind the orang utangs.
9582 2018-09-25 09:28:30 Excellent post. Particularly like the observation that "prescribing snake oil on the NHS" is not the answer to a snake oil problem....
9583 2018-09-25 09:28:26 @BBoason l think palm oil, cocoa, rubber, rice and other major crops should have dedicated ministries with given targets. If we are really serious about getting the needed results. It will bring focus and accountability

9586 2018-09-25 09:28:12 Now, you’ve got to talk about what barbaric, vampire & greedy Britain is doing in Nigeria and the millions of Biafrans they’ve eliminated bcos of oil. Britain are armed robbers. They just can’t keep their hands to themselves. They kill for gold, oil, diamond. Britain =TERRORISM
9587 2018-09-25 09:28:10 @narendramodi @arunjaitley @PiyushGoyal Long term gain tax put small dent in capital market then dollar and now crude oil prices but small hole of long term gain tax put by government itself and now retailers have to pay price for that !!
9588 2018-09-25 09:27:56 The biggest reason of petrol price hike is reliance oil company... The cost taken as tax is very small as compared to margin of oil companies
9589 2018-09-25 09:27:53 My tummy bothers me the most.. I have been using cell tone tissue oil for the past 3months, I can see a slight improvement. But stretch marks are depressing
9590 2018-09-25 09:27:52 Because the US economy is held to ransom by the oil and advertising industries (among other evil corps of course)

9592 2018-09-25 09:27:46 @Ritzcrackers please stop buying palm oil from companies destroying rainforests. To do that you need to drop the dirtiest palm oil giant and single biggest threat to Indonesian rainforests - Wilmar.

9598 2018-09-25 09:26:58 you lot say we cannot compete with city because their oil yet at the same time you want to do it the "right way"
9599 2018-09-25 09:26:56 It was always going to unwind back though because they’ve basically killed off any small oil firms. Now it’s just big players in the entire industry, and they want their full potential margin back. 

It’s crazy how many efficiencies they had apparently.

9608 2018-09-25 09:25:52 Oga @BBoason You will think with higher oil prices. I'll be optimistic. But the petroleum subsidy is bleeding us dry. (those 2017 budget performance numbers are scary, except the 2018 numbers are any better). Being optimistic is hard today.

9615 2018-09-25 09:25:08 @Ritzcrackers PLEASE STOP DEALING with WILMAR and by doing so “DROP" the dirtiest palm oil giant and single biggest threat to the rapidly disappearing Indonesian rainforests.
Thank you.
9616 2018-09-25 09:25:07 So it’s around how the Arab nations about 4-5 years ago deliberately brought the price down to undercut other oil firms, more so the American firms. They could afford to cut into their margin while the others struggled or just broke even
9617 2018-09-25 09:25:00 `bbcnews Are electric bikes restricted so as to protect the oil industry.E.g. pedal powered bikes are permitted to travel faster than e_bikes which are limited to 20mph and power is limited INSTEAD of having speed limiters fitted.Yet again the uk fails to fight global warming!

When the oil price went down under PMB, which other high revenue generating industry did the GEJ-admin leave for him?

Our reserves were low, the oil price was low and we had almost nothing to lean on.
9631 2018-09-25 09:23:33 @Ritzcrackers Please drop dirty palm oil now! We cannot risk losing our amazing orangutan cousins, and we must stop destroying the world's precious rainforests! Please stop using unsustainable palm oil from companies like Wilmar.

9711 2018-09-25 09:13:18 But also conflicts of interest. Many people in regions with many oil & gas jobs are very resistant to the idea that we should "keep it in the ground", or even end exploration; they blame demand, and say they need to use the wealth to fund the transition.

9828 2018-09-25 09:00:14 This requires a legal analysis. Facilitation of Iran's oil export would be in violation of secondary sanctions. But the question is whether the European exporters who are paid with the funds generated in result of oil export would also be in violation of sanctions or not.

9847 2018-09-25 08:57:06 @Ritzcrackers You've promised to cut ties with deforestation, so why are you still purchasing palm oil from Wilmar? As its customer, you are contributing to the destruction of Indonesia's wildlife and environment. Make a positive change and cut ties with Wilmar - please!

9850 2018-09-25 08:56:39 My research & opinion: Full tank is 6k. Change oil after every 2500miles or 5000kms, best lube oil for me is Mobil. After 2000miles, it appears as if its low. Add 1more litre of oil. And it takes you extra 1000-1200miles. Before replacing. Its the best car on Nigeria road now
9851 2018-09-25 08:56:36 はい！！！！！！
9852 2018-09-25 08:56:24 exactly, that's the reason they have risen their oil production to replace Iran's. poor those who have such an advisors so detached from reality!

9882 2018-09-25 08:53:45 The things is when international crude oil prices dropped our govt instead of lowering gas prices they kept the same price and used the money to initiate mega projects, now sudden unexpected rise in crude oil price is hitting them hard...Mumbai has got the worst hit

9885 2018-09-25 08:53:28 @Ritzcrackers, please stop buying palm oil from companies destroying rainforests! 
9886 2018-09-25 08:53:28 Ritz, you need to drop the dirtiest palm oil giant  'Wilmar', You are one of their biggest customers and this company is producing their palm oil by tearing down hectares of rainforest every week to make way for Palm Oil plantations.

If you really do care then stop using them!
9887 2018-09-25 08:53:26 How could the oil possibly leave if you tax big oil?!?!? You mean, no other company would like to make BILLIONS at the hand of hard working Sask. families?!?! How much money are you getting from big oil to sell out your own people?!?! #corrupt #sask #saskpoli
9888 2018-09-25 08:53:25 Remember when the worst thing to come out of this presidency was the way he was talking like a moron and trying to rescind national parks for oil drilling?  Yeah I am beyond words and saddened that we are where we are now.

9891 2018-09-25 08:53:11 Don’t buy products with palm oil unless it’s from a sustainable source. You’re contributing to habitat destruction. Shit sucks.
9892 2018-09-25 08:53:08 Assad, Saddam, Gaddafi, all brutal dictators and murderers. How can that be dealt with when the “moral” high ground is just as evil. Once the USA was the moral backbone against tyranny in the world but that all changed in 1938 with discovery of oil in Saudi Arabia. Hypocrisy now.

9899 2018-09-25 08:51:34 3% is a bit ridiculous. Would suggest oil companies are almost better off keeping the money in the bank than engaging in oil exploration. It's an activity which is speculative and has huge margins - that's why they can afford to spend so much searching for new oil fields
9900 2018-09-25 08:51:33  your rant is so typical when confronted with harsh reality of modern times. Once oil’s relevance reduces, how is the great Arab world planning to feed itself- sending refugees to RoW? Oh wait ISIS and Taliban are the industries of the future 
9901 2018-09-25 08:51:26 Perfect location and time in history for using renewable energy. Guessing the oil is for sale, not for local use. And how much of the profits will benefit average Gambians? Going for solar, wind etc would also create jobs.

9911 2018-09-25 08:50:35 $amrn Shorts bailed when it held the $10 yesterday perhaps that was the squeeze in the afternoon. Being a pessimist and a thus a short seller I'd say a purified fish oil is going to be 99% more expensive than ordinary fish oil that by definition you would just need to take more
