2 2018-08-22 23:56:37 This warren bi— ch should be put in stocks and stone. Our politicians have no respect for Americans white black brown yellow red they only care about there success stop voting for politicians
3 2018-08-22 23:56:29 Rubbish! The stocks were depleted because the Spanish hoovered all the baby fish up as delicacies and in more recent times the Dutch are fishing by electrocuting the whole sea bed, killing everything.

6 2018-08-22 23:53:36 Very reassuring to the Republican base. The ones who do not have stocks to inside trade and don’t have campaign funds to travel and splurge.  They can send a few dollars to Trump though to pay all the hush money bills. A blessed base they are.
7 2018-08-22 23:52:51 You took office in 2017, so you’s sayin’ the longest “bull market” (they sez that means when the stocks is risin’)! in history is only a year and a halve!?

43 2018-08-22 23:37:37 I know Democrats hate this!! Sorry my heart bleeds for you!!!
U.S. stocks turned in a lackluster performance Wednesday, but this session goes down in the record books as the day that marked the longest bull market run in history.
44 2018-08-22 23:36:57 Read a book
45 2018-08-22 23:36:37 They demands an apology and a resign letter from you! Who is interested in stock market high? Only those who can effort to invest in stocks and that is not the majority! A total fail in MAGA, resign and let the work expert do, who understand beeing a president, traitor!
46 2018-08-22 23:36:28 WM types are only kicking themselves because Gordon Brown divested from gold and then we bailed out some banks - we have an embarrassment of crappy stocks. They shoulda bunged some bucks Bezos' and Jobs' way, then they'd be laughing.
47 2018-08-22 23:36:18 Absolutely. I have tested 'undervaled' stocks... which underpreformed, and 'overvalued' stocks which have outperformed. Moral of the story... FOLLOW PRICE!!!
48 2018-08-22 23:36:03 I say 1 for 1000
49 2018-08-22 23:35:06 Of the 15 stocks in the S&P 500 index that lost at least 30% in calendar year 2017, 12 of those stocks have a positive return YTD through 7/31/18. 4 of the 12 “up” stocks have gained at least +28% YTD in 2018 (source: BTN Research).
50 2018-08-22 23:33:23 US stocks closed mixed, with the Nasdaq gaining on the strength of tech stocks while the S&P 500 was little changed as it marked its longest bull market run. Ahead of the local open SPI futures ware 17 points higher at 6,253. #ausshares #stockmarket
51 2018-08-22 23:31:19 And the 10% who own 83% of the stocks really appreciate it
52 2018-08-22 23:31:08 Again you have no concept of trade agreements. No I said cut off aid as an easy example of how easy it is to fund the wall. Wake up

54 2018-08-22 23:29:11 I bought two stocks today then made 11 dollars profit

56 2018-08-22 23:25:02 I keep posting the pictures of what each company's stocks are worth right now! But people keep trying to argue smh. I dont like it either but these are #FACTS
57 2018-08-22 23:24:36 They marketed it inaccurately, true, but it doesn't sound like they did it on purpose.  It seemed like they genuinely believed it. To me at least.  
If Bitfi had publicly traded stocks, I would invest because their product IS going to get more and more secure.  Again,
58 2018-08-22 23:23:57 Stock market isn't a measure of the economy for the 90% of us who can't afford to buy stocks dummy. You are screwing us all. Traitor.
59 2018-08-22 23:23:52 Yes look at USDT, what is it now? 2.8 billion worth of bullshit backed crypto. Do you really think that securities like stocks and bonds are going to be traded on a brokerage firm 3-5 years from now? Portfolios of mutual funds are going to be auto rebalanced and held in your PC

63 2018-08-22 23:21:03 $BVS looks like supply has completely dried up and should fly based on pre open data. Results out on the 28th and if they’re anything like how the rest of the ASX tech stocks have done it should sky rocket.

69 2018-08-22 23:14:17 By US stocks do you mean the DJIA? Because the Nasdaq, where a lot of Israeli stocks are traded, is probably up more than 4.5%

77 2018-08-22 23:08:00 there is no correlation between the state of the economy and you being president. it could be hilary, bernie, or santa claus and both stocks and unemployment would be at virtually the same levels - the economy does as the economy does. full stop.
78 2018-08-22 23:07:55 Yeah, it's from corporations buying back their own stocks using the money from the massive tax breaks you gave them. You said they'd give it back to the employees, but they didn't. This is a false economy. Pay rates are down,insurance went up.
The economy is gonna tank due to you
79 2018-08-22 23:07:28 I shorthanded the quote, but context was the same. I sent Primavera budget docs to @TeamDucey (you and @PatPtak) on 8/8 to see if @dougducey wanted to amend his quote about $8.8 mil in tax dollars used for CEO pay, and ed funds used on stocks and not kids. @TeamDucey declined.
80 2018-08-22 23:06:11 #StockMarketToday Stocks batted between small gains and losses Wednesday, and ended mixed with the Dow and S&P 500 lower slightly while the Nasdaq gained 0.4%. Will the #BullMarket, which today becomes the longest US bull market ever, be negatively impacted by Trump’s legal woes?
81 2018-08-22 23:05:46 So, if you work you don't deserve money to enjoy living, but if you gamble and win you do deserve?  Stocks are gamble, risk is involved.
82 2018-08-22 23:03:33 They are privately owned companies whose stocks are traded on a public exchange. They are not owned by the gov't, which is why the 1st Amendment doesn't apply. It literally starts out as "Congress shall make no laws . . ." Read a fucking book for God's sake.

91 2018-08-22 23:01:15 My first savings was a credit union savings account; then I moved to CDs; then mutual funds; it wasn’t until later that I got into IRAs, 401(k)s, stocks, bonds, etc. The govt simply provided me the vehicle - I drove the vehicle once I learned how to do it. What’s up with people?
92 2018-08-22 23:00:50 #firstworldsuccesstories Not everyone in America has stocks or 401ks, would be nice if you would do something about healthcare or things that impact regular Americans.

97 2018-08-22 22:58:07 AAP: "Australian shares are expected to open slightly higher on the back of a mixed performance on Wall Street overnight, where the Nasdaq gained on the strength of tech stocks.

The SPI200 futures contract was up 10 points, or 0.16 per cent, to 6,246 points at 0800 AEST,"
98 2018-08-22 22:57:52 Well people invest in stocks to create wealth over time, which is why over a multitude of years and various economic downturns it still ends up going higher and higher. It’s designed as a growth function, which is why I always think the long side is the highest probability trade
99 2018-08-22 22:57:43 YT is wild, cuz one min I'm trying to gain some money knowledge from icon @soundlyawake, next thing I know I'm now trading stocks. How?
100 2018-08-22 22:53:37 The big money will not flow just yet so still time to scoop up U stocks at bargain basement prices. My guess is things will start to ramp up around November, steady increases through 2019 and early 2020 and then the big price spike in late 2020 when shortages start to bite hard.
101 2018-08-22 22:51:47 I sell stocks, idk what your talking about 
102 2018-08-22 22:46:41 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to treat your cancer
103 2018-08-22 22:46:39 And people from Appalachia wonder why they are portrayed as backwards laughing stocks.
104 2018-08-22 22:44:21 The killer had no "RIGHT" to modify those guns with bump stocks to function as fully automatic weapons. So your statement stands false. That is not "gun rights". No law can stop that.
105 2018-08-22 22:43:05 Won’t be one pick, probably about 5 to keep my overall portfolio to around 30 stocks.

107 2018-08-22 22:42:02 A recession with the 30 yr at 2.98% will be the total end of the bond market.

Fed will go back to ZIRP or even negative and QE the 30 yr down to 1%. Japan style.

Stocks and housing will skyrocket.
108 2018-08-22 22:40:42 Apparently you’ve forgotten Obama inherited a collapsed economy from Republicans. Millions lost homes, jobs, life savings. He brought it back & handed Trump a fantastic growing economy w the lowest unemployment rate in decades among all races. Record stocks

111 2018-08-22 22:35:30 Many of those people who "represent us" got very rich on healthcare stocks. Some insurance companies have been sleazy for years and lie. UHC had been pretty good but people are having more problems with them from what I understand. Jon Gruber knew ACA was unaffordable & genocide.

All of them run on Uranium. And U stocks still languish. Bull is on
116 2018-08-22 22:33:29 If we were going to report stocks we would also need to report export sales on a regular basis.... as you say @Dartman62 stocks by themselves would not paint the full picture.... not sure we will get the buy in across industry on either front....

126 2018-08-22 22:26:36 ma'am may I have some stocks in this company
127 2018-08-22 22:26:11 You have no concept of trade agreements,is Mexico writing a Check? No dip shit. Hey let’s cut off aid for illegals, boom paid for. 
Stop human trafficking unless you’re for that kind of thing.
128 2018-08-22 22:25:28 Why is increase in wages And prices problematic if demand is increasing alongside it (from increased consumption). Why do we have to keep hearing this supply side doctrine and infinitum, when all that money just sits in savings and stocks
129 2018-08-22 22:25:24 33 #stocks reached all-time highs in "technology" yesterday.

132 2018-08-22 22:23:41 You can do that by trading either stocks, forex, binary options or crypto. Tonight there is going to be a free webinar to show people how they can learn, invest and earn in forex and crypto and multiply their money. If u are interested let me know. I will give u the time and link
133 2018-08-22 22:23:02 If you aren’t in stocks w/ an oil company well you better fucking be!
134 2018-08-22 22:22:42 I was correct about stocks going higher and last few months, before july, being consolidation. #SPX500 #STOCKS #RECORDHIGH. My AI bots are getting better and better. #AI

@_RaggedyDan_  i got you Bro 
136 2018-08-22 22:21:13 The fact that you think any of those are comparable displays a complete lack of understanding of competitive balance. 

Limit kills in the 60-90s, is blockable, does not cross screen instantaneously and doesn't carry between stocks. 
Cloud shares macs recovery weakness.
137 2018-08-22 22:20:45 So why don’t financial advisors just invest in stocks by themselves? Right...they have a skill so they use that to help others while profiting.
138 2018-08-22 22:20:39 Don't play the penny stocks.
139 2018-08-22 22:20:27 @adam_stocks_ @Michaelj2207 goal of the season sorted !!
140 2018-08-22 22:20:22 2015/16 most stocks were down 25-50%
141 2018-08-22 22:19:48 If they are then Magoo needs to be tried and (if guilty of whatever I choose) spit on while in the stocks with Uncle Joe groping his Girly Bottom
142 2018-08-22 22:19:31 There must be one potential multi bagger on your radar somewhere Rudi. These pitty patty 2% up today 3% down tomorrow stocks are so boring. I wouldnt dream of buying them. Are you going to force me to follow someone like Tony Locantro?
143 2018-08-22 22:19:06 Jason, what is your disclosure here?
Are you being paid to pin this post and host this third party research report that was paid for by $K2F.
Your Bio says you prefer blue chip stocks?  #ethicsinresearch @asicmedia 
144 2018-08-22 22:18:56 a) Only less than 20% of Americans own stocks. 
b) In 2008 the indices were still falling from 8000 and start climbing from mid 2009 till 2017. The point is that you had very little to do with it. You fail economy 101.
145 2018-08-22 22:18:37 She is fix from   stocks .   
146 2018-08-22 22:18:34 @realDonaldTrump as for the stock market making America and its economy great, how does a good stock market help the middle-lower class citizens who aren’t involved in stocks or can barely afford their essential bills. If u wanna make America great again start with the Americans
147 2018-08-22 22:18:11 Did you invest in a mutual fund or just saw an IPO and went for it? Or what?

I’m seriously thinking about moving some funds around and developing a portfolio that only consist of high yield stocks related to the cannabis industry and cannabis tech
148 2018-08-22 22:17:38 Every stock trader knows that you're the only obstacle for higher highs in the market. Your stupid tariffs and tweets and scandals and policies put the break on both USD and the stocks
149 2018-08-22 22:14:23 People stop listening 2 this #IDIOT about the stock market!  He keeps referencing the #DJIA which is made up of just 30 stocks.  How many of u r invested in just those 30 stocks?  Stocks go up & down.  If they kept going up u wouldn't be able to afford them!  @Apple $200+ a share
150 2018-08-22 22:14:06 #tytlive Do they care that they may crash the market, when the leaders will still make money selling their stocks during buybacks?
151 2018-08-22 22:13:57 WOW... nice of you to make the rich richer. I sure do wish I could afford to buy a ton of stocks. Of course I'd be selling them real quick about now and getting ready for the great recession about to hit America because of your tRumptard policies.

153 2018-08-22 22:13:02 You can make the stock market as exciting as the Triple Crown Race.  We love your show.  Whenever Shep comes on, it’s time for your show.
The only thing that could add would be if you were doing the Auctioneer for the stocks.  Haha.
154 2018-08-22 22:12:40 One have shown any true seance of country since this mobster took office. Why.  Their stocks are fat and they give a cheap about, we the people
155 2018-08-22 22:12:13 Excellent points! I remember once in grad school reading an AMAZING paper about how all of Jane Austen was predicated on the ownership of stocks and bonds -- newly popular at that time -- which were almost all companies implicated in the slave trade one way or the other.
156 2018-08-22 22:12:04 Can you post what stocks will go up?
157 2018-08-22 22:11:59 Which app or brokerage do you use?  I haven't bought stocks in a long time.  I see @RobinhoodApp doesn't support it.
158 2018-08-22 22:11:15 Sold a lot of my weed stock cause I was taking amazing loses... Checked it today and the little I still have is out performing every other stock I own. Stocks, ETFs and all this ish is new to me but I can see it’s worth it in the long run.

160 2018-08-22 22:10:00 Exactly Little intern our tax dollars pay I wonder how much insider trading they do for Hatch with all his medical stocks
161 2018-08-22 22:09:07 So amazing!
162 2018-08-22 22:08:52 Investing in stocks defers from trading it. I can invest in a broker to trade while I earn returns.
163 2018-08-22 22:07:56 Meanwhile marths kills at any percent, crosses half screen unreactable, works in air or ground, is safe on whiff, can't be knocked out of him, and stays between stocks. Marth traded nothing for this. Its tacked on for free. Your argument is completely nonsensical. Non comparable.
164 2018-08-22 22:06:44 Shameless.
165 2018-08-22 22:06:00 Long Tails Doji on FTSE100 - chopping around like I'm sure many of us experienced on our Stocks today. Still in Range with 7477 at bottom and 7616 at top. FTSE250 same wild swings.
166 2018-08-22 22:05:50 Yes, they have similar kill powers. Ko Punch does not reach half screen, does not work in the air, does not build between stocks, CAN be knocked out of mac, has 86 frames of lag on whiff, and was exchanged for a complete lack of aerial and recovery game. But sure, kill power.

170 2018-08-22 22:03:57 $SPY Being positioned well before the move on stocks certainly made for an easy day. Love it.  Also focused on locking in some nice profits.
171 2018-08-22 22:03:31 We didn’t break the snowfall record. By, like, a lot. 

Someone needs to be put in stocks in Perry Square.
172 2018-08-22 22:02:16 And stocks go down with news of guilty verdicts. Did you see that this morning?  Maybe give all the info not just highlights.
173 2018-08-22 22:01:35 Anyway fuck QPR and Villa. I’m only interested in us doing well really. Just hope we all stay united and there’s no more mega negativity.

181 2018-08-22 21:59:28 It began almost exactly on the day that Obama remarked that investing in stocks might be a good idea, since they were so undervalued.
182 2018-08-22 21:59:14 They get it, Mary! The Fox’s in the henhouse eating up all of the chickens & making holders of Shares & Stocks invested in the Stock market rich & dirty business free to rip off & kill the American consumer! He is Putin’s Trojan Horse! It’s about Paper & Absentee Voting Ballots!
183 2018-08-22 21:59:11 What if Stocks are not moving up but it’s the dollar moving down....
184 2018-08-22 21:58:40 The world is getting pretty used to international laughing stocks, actually
185 2018-08-22 21:58:14 buy certain stocks
186 2018-08-22 21:58:14 I'm trying to use technical analysis on less news driven stocks to gain my edge. I've found that #potstocks are too volatile to guess where they are going to go. Trends can change overnight in that sector.

189 2018-08-22 21:56:54 Few stocks have been more consistent money makers than #Facebook whose only down year was in 2012, the same one in which it went public. #Bulls are proving slower,leaving the stock behind even as they bid up other tech titans including Apple Inc. and #Amazon.com Inc.

193 2018-08-22 21:55:09 Aussie shares are expected to open firmer this morning. US stocks had a mixed reaction to the Federal Reserve indicating they intend to maintain a gradual pace for rate hikes. The S&P 500 index continued its longest bull-market run. #market #ASX #US #tech #Australia #morning

195 2018-08-22 21:53:55 Think that’s got more to do with hiring McClaren.. yeh you’re right, they have the same embargo rules we had and they’re hard to work around. Yes really pleased with last night, showed we have a backbone and a genius as a HC. Onto Norwich
196 2018-08-22 21:52:15 Hey Brian when did the bull market in stocks begin and what was the catalyst, in your opinion?
197 2018-08-22 21:52:01 time for the federal reserve to market its new products! Tear off dollar  bill bath tissue...prepay tax payments with stocks of USA dollars printed on butt friendly paper, get yours today at local federal reserve “farm store”
198 2018-08-22 21:51:52 Blackadder III had the right idea: "Thick Jack sits in the stocks and is pelted with rotten tomatoes"
199 2018-08-22 21:50:13 What about the 50% that do not own stocks? Where are their raises you promised?

207 2018-08-22 21:42:52 #GOPTaxScam favors the most wealthy.

Oh please tell the American people how it benefits us when powerful corporations use their tax cuts to buy back their own stocks ... Increase the wealth of the company

Trickle Down is Fictious.
@HouseGOP @SenateGOP @RepKevinBrady @OrrinHatch
208 2018-08-22 21:42:24 If you’re only judging your president by how well your stocks are doing or how much money you got in the tax cut, please unfollow me now and never come back. He has been a despicable human being throughout his adult life and continues to degrade the value of the US.
209 2018-08-22 21:42:09 Yes, let’s make it so undesirable for qualified people to serve in public office that our government and we suffer the consequences. How can you tell people they can’t buy or sell stocks? It’s not reasonable or feasible.

214 2018-08-22 21:40:36 Longest bull run referring to stocks or all the bullshit coming from you?
215 2018-08-22 21:40:36 48% of Americans don’t own any stocks at all and meager wage growth is being outpaced by inflation
216 2018-08-22 21:40:05 Liz Warren only cares about coddling illegals to get them legalized and voting Democrat. Doesn't matter how many people are murdered, raped, or assaulted by those people because potential voters outweigh it all.
217 2018-08-22 21:39:58 Combos in smash 4 are optimised for damage, not to take the opponent offstage in a bad spot. Better edgeguarding and more stocks in the game just add another level of depth to the game. Allows another way than just damage to gain an advantage. More situations more to learn imo
218 2018-08-22 21:39:57 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around

221 2018-08-22 21:38:59 Congratulations to anyone that can afford to have enough stocks that when the market goes up they can notice it.
222 2018-08-22 21:37:35 Yeah but they’re paying for it on the field now mate. Looking dross. Just hope we can continue to play well and get results. It’s got to happen soon.

Rinse and repeat

Nowhere in the statement does POTUS take credit, but he does point out a milestone & congratulate America on "our" good fortune.

My deferred comp, IRA's, and stocks have been great for 2 yrs.
226 2018-08-22 21:34:54 @TheFive they can hit Trump over everything.  But, my Democratic family isn’t stupid they are selling stocks the minute Trump isn’t in office.   Lol.

227 2018-08-22 21:34:04 Not to level it should have done, football league absolutely bottled it. They can pay 20 million of their fine by transferring shares. It’s ended up a quarter of the original fine. Sooner we’re out the better (been saying that for 15 years )

243 2018-08-22 21:30:08 Trading stocks, listening to live Dead shows all day, rock climbing in the afternoon and coming home to my amazing wife. I am so blessed and so thankful to the universal spirit for this life!
244 2018-08-22 21:29:39 Only 10 percent of AMERICANS own Stocks. The rest are TRUMP and his Rich croonies.
245 2018-08-22 21:29:07 You touting the stock market's "bull run" shows just how out of touch you are with the average American who pay taxes and live paycheck to paycheck! The stocks do nothing but benefit millionaires like you, "elites!" You are a liar in chief who scammed your way in the White House!
246 2018-08-22 21:29:01 I would hate to own stocks in Netflix right now, these rumors of ads in between episodes seems like a real deal breaker.
247 2018-08-22 21:28:56 Just crazy, I can only assume because it’s spread other 3 years now they’re banking on promotion this year then pay the fine in the prem or they couldn’t give a shit

249 2018-08-22 21:28:32 Traders, you're doing yourself a disservice if you're continually 2nd guessing (micro analyzing) every move on your stocks. Take a step back
250 2018-08-22 21:28:11 You are correct!  10 percent of Americans own Stocks  and 50 percent donot own Stocks. So TRUMP bragging and the Rich got RICHER.
251 2018-08-22 21:28:08 Wno benefits? Those with stocks and shares ? How does it affect health insurance for the poor and the children you have put in cages and separated from parents? You only look after the wealthy and yourself. There is more to life than money and golf.
252 2018-08-22 21:27:44 Get rid of the conference championships, and this makes all the sense in the world. Will be a blockbuster.  Christmas shopping will grind to a halt. Retail stocks down on rumor...
253 2018-08-22 21:26:23 Excellent point. From a Trump supporter. If you are a hypocrit, and actually own some stocks in your 401K, not financial advice, I would sell those stocks. The fed has been propping up this market. It is going to crash and Trump will blame them (rightly) and say they did it 4 him
254 2018-08-22 21:25:51 Shout out to my co-worker for getting me on some killer stocks. Making some gawd damn money out here boys.

259 2018-08-22 21:22:40 Most Americans are dependent on their stagnant wages that are now worth less thanks to inflation. They don’t own stocks, and your bull market is just bull-shit as far they’re concerned.

261 2018-08-22 21:21:41 People thought the same during tech bubble in ‘00/‘01, and here in Canada a pop in cannabis stocks. No matter the timeline, irrational exuberance will surely get the best of those who FOMO.
262 2018-08-22 21:21:33 Not everyone plays or has the opportunity to invest in stocks. So more rich people got rich. Trickle down economy is a myth.

Several difficult angles around stocks reporting as grain in the bin doesn’t equate to available stocks. The entire industry would need to show their hand (discretely) and with some level of accuracy/honesty.
268 2018-08-22 21:18:11 that's fine and well but you strike while the iron's hot; if investors are re-thinking their ownership of SD stocks, then take it the extra step and give them a reason to ditch

273 2018-08-22 21:16:26 I told a bunch of traders to pay attention to @RokuPlayer. Ever since the Q2 call and bump, they all think I know way more about tech or stocks than I do. I just love Roku and thought that most people (73% or so) in an emerging industry would too.

282 2018-08-22 21:12:46 Good ! Now size back up and slam these stocks like you used to.( in due time).

286 2018-08-22 21:09:12 Only read the surface notes of Warren's proposal but it had me thinking - given govt. employees are on pension, would those of you in private sector take 80% pay for life after, say, 25-30 years' service, or ability to buy stocks (using job to influence at your own legal risk)?

301 2018-08-22 21:03:36 As a trader I love that stocks are going up but it's a big red flag when the bulk of the market gains are happening from the few behemoth FANG companies.

322 2018-08-22 20:58:07 3. If I overpay on labor then my bottom line takes a massive hit which I have to either a) past that cost to consumers or b) increase production without hiring extra staff. Which means you get to do double the work for the same pay.
323 2018-08-22 20:57:45 I don't have many stocks myself. What I have are preferred. I also invest after tax money. Those jackasses could wreck a 401 by raising the tax rate. Lol
324 2018-08-22 20:57:41 There’s some bull running all right, but it has nothing to do with stocks. Seems to be coming from the White House and it’s stinking up the country!
325 2018-08-22 20:57:02 And who benefits? Those with stocks - the rich and large corporations NOT the average American; so please stop with the bragging about this - we want the average American to enjoy benefits that this Administration is only giving to the top 1%.
326 2018-08-22 20:56:57 US stocks just reached longest bull market ever........
327 2018-08-22 20:56:52 2. Labor costs v. Material costs v. static costs v. variable costs to come to a price point that is acceptable to consumers and to my bottom line. I grow my company, not you. You are hired to make widgets. I pay you the market rate to make said widget based on complexity.

338 2018-08-22 20:53:52 Further, imagine if you could short those stocks.
339 2018-08-22 20:53:33 You mean, congratulations, wealthy friends. How many people do you think can actually afford to invest in stocks?
340 2018-08-22 20:53:23 I want to but I like the way the stocks look
341 2018-08-22 20:53:19 1. That's not how economies work. GM made products nobody wanted. Overprices, shoddy and hampered by legacy costs. If I make a widget and it sells, I will make more widgets. If demand outpaces my supply, I hire people to make more widgets. I have to balance
342 2018-08-22 20:53:12 Yeah we could do a lot but Republicans dont give a fuck about crime unless they can use it as a bludgeon against a minority group.

348 2018-08-22 20:50:17 Most Americans can't afford to buy stocks
349 2018-08-22 20:50:06 You need to try harder. There is no reason in my opinion your company can't be more completive and work harder to lower rates. Spending millions on advertising to sell people on the idea you aren't very competitive is counterproductive. #marketing #Business #Stocks #investing
350 2018-08-22 20:49:21 These are mostly all day trades... very few swings.  I do use options when things set up exactly how I want, but almost all option trades are on S&P500 stocks (really liquid w/ no wide spreads).  Been using pre-market and AH trading as well, especially post-earnings.
351 2018-08-22 20:49:04 you wanna own stocks in a company that has the website jammed up with loads of people filling shopping carts and banners in front of stores?

353 2018-08-22 20:48:51 Jeremiah was promised he would be successful. When Jeremiah found himself in stocks he accused God of deceiving him. That is not blasphemy. That is a man speaking to a God that communicated with him. This is not “blasphemy”. Jeremiah did succeed in the end. He wasn’t deceived.
354 2018-08-22 20:48:32 Justice is a lie. Like shorting stocks.

364 2018-08-22 20:43:01 Trump is an absolute moron, but more than 0.1% of Americans own stocks.
365 2018-08-22 20:42:57 God told jerimiah that he would be successful. When Jeremiah found himself in stocks he accused God of deceiving him. It wasn’t blasphemy. It was a man going through trials. He had misunderstood. God didn’t say he wouldn’t go through tough times. He did secede in the end.
366 2018-08-22 20:42:55 What stocks fell?
367 2018-08-22 20:42:49 I like stocks. The only bond I like right now is James. James never goes out of style.
368 2018-08-22 20:42:33 Why am I paying more to live? Stocks r an illusion that doesn't indicate a strong economy.Traitor.
369 2018-08-22 20:42:32 Either save a little bit each month and invest, or do nothing and smile when all stocks come crashing down in say less than two years.

374 2018-08-22 20:41:25 You do know that only about half of all adult Americans own stocks or mutual funds, right? Of course you don’t, you ignoramus.
375 2018-08-22 20:41:23 @TeamCavuto On this special day you claim green instead of @realDonaldTrump . If ppl listened to you the stocks would have plummeted many times. Seems ppl see you have been disingenuous. Winning with out your help clown!
376 2018-08-22 20:41:02 The top five most active stocks today were $AMD, $GE, $T, $BAC, and $F.
377 2018-08-22 20:40:55 The majority of the working class holds stocks in their 401ks or IRAs. Not just rich people. If you cant save $20/week to put in an IRA you will never retire and no one can help you not be a loser

384 2018-08-22 20:38:54 One has to think that timing really couldn't be better now for entering positions in #uranium stocks, imho. $URA has spent last 6 months bashing down share prices of its #U3O8 related holdings, creating fire sale prices while Spot rising as traders return from summer holidays.

387 2018-08-22 20:37:30 Barmy isn’t it. How has this happened? Thought they had to find £40m to be on an even keel
388 2018-08-22 20:37:28 Si tu n’as pas fait de sport depuis longtemps ton corps doit peut-être se remettre. Et puis attention à tes chutes de réserves et à bien refaire des stocks d’énergies après. Remets toi bien. Bye.
389 2018-08-22 20:37:25 There will not pullback after every breakout but pullback are reliable for taking new position...Strong momentum stocks will not have any pullback that's my observations Peter sir , correct me if m wrong...
390 2018-08-22 20:37:14 I'm so sorry about all the complains you received. For such limited stocks, your work is more than affordable, and even the shipping was a good surprise... besides, you keep your customers updated, nothing shady. I don't understand, your run your business well in so many ways.
391 2018-08-22 20:36:53 If you own any stocks, you will lose them when they lock you up.
392 2018-08-22 20:36:41 Do you know why?Its because you gave these multi-million dollar corporations, massive tax cuts and instead of raising wages,they did buy-backs of their own stocks. Hate to tell you, but a majority of Americans don't own any stocks, but I'm sure all of your rich friends are happy!
393 2018-08-22 20:36:06 Can we prevent being laughing stocks to others by hyping tf out of this cb than meddling with "what ifs" & possible colabs

395 2018-08-22 20:35:51 Where you're going you'll need cigarettes to trade not stocks dude.  Don't bend over in the shower :)
396 2018-08-22 20:35:49 My boy talking about 3 stocks but don't wanna 1 stock a beer with ya boy. Smh. Hahaha
397 2018-08-22 20:35:42 The last time I bought Rizla for £17 it said stocks were low. Just paid £15 for my next lot. Saying stocks are low is scare tactics for online retailers!
398 2018-08-22 20:35:40 There’s not enough gold to do business like that.  The countries are already in severe debt- especially many in the EU, Russia, even China weak and boosting there economy by buying their own stocks.

401 2018-08-22 20:33:01 @DoNotLose Hi Glen, FNMA and FMCC stocks seem to be picking up steam this week. Is there a change of perception about Fanniegate outcome? What has changed, fundamentally?
402 2018-08-22 20:32:55 Subscriber: Thanks for what you do. I invested in $EAST upon your
recommendation. And thanks to @mengeled for a range of recommended 
marijuana stocks. Thank you both. --Rob. Auckland, New Zealand.
403 2018-08-22 20:32:44 What's your point ? Bonds don't create wealth. Stocks dont create wealth. Nothing arbitrarily creates wealth. Wealth creation is a process.
404 2018-08-22 20:32:25 That's great for people who can afford to buy stocks. What about the rest of us? Oh, and thank you Obama! #IMPEACH45!

408 2018-08-22 20:31:18 Michael, I have never shorted a stock, I stick and stay, and have done well in investing on the stocks I own.
409 2018-08-22 20:30:48 J'ai besoin de toi comme d'une infirmière, que tu répares ma tête et mes sentiments qui fonctionnent plus bien, que tu refasses mes stocks de sérotonines, que tu me dises que c'est rien
410 2018-08-22 20:29:38 ...or, bulls are all-in on such stocks already.
411 2018-08-22 20:28:40 So many thoughts about codetermination:

1) When stocks lose value, is that going to just WRECK municipal pension funds?

2) Would this increase demands for treasury bonds?
412 2018-08-22 20:27:43 What does this have to do with my statement?

If their net worth increased, does that somehow mean stocks are a great indicator of economy, and that Trump's family aren't elitist assholes?

413 2018-08-22 20:27:36 FT Cotgrave 0 vs City 1. What a win. Stocks with the only goal as City hold on with 10 men for the last 20 as Bowles sent off. Ended the game with 2 16-year olds on the wings, too. Great effort from all. 
414 2018-08-22 20:27:31 Excited to have you behind the bench coach!

416 2018-08-22 20:26:37 The Republicans using Mollie’s murder for their agenda is no different than Democrats using every mass shooting for gun control. They hardly ever mention mental health, just reducing gun sales, background checks, banning bump stocks, etc. NONE OF THE REAL ISSUES.

418 2018-08-22 20:25:33 U.S. #stocks turned in a lackluster performance Wednesday, but this session goes down in the record books as the day that marked the longest bull market run in history.
The current bull market began on March 9, 2009, when the S&P 500 was at 676 points, hard hit by the Recession
419 2018-08-22 20:25:02 I think investing in stocks with careful selection and diversification is a good option but to become a #millionaire, the Weird Millionaire invested in the market but also diversified into other investments like gold, real estate and hard money loans.
420 2018-08-22 20:24:28 What is going on with GD stocks PT good investment for Brazil or not?

421 2018-08-22 20:23:24 Target stocks going up 
422 2018-08-22 20:23:05 Stocks exited that bull run in January 2018, when Trump's economy took over. Thanks Obama!
423 2018-08-22 20:22:09 The more the stocks lag the more violent will be the move in the stocks.
424 2018-08-22 20:22:03 Fact: A good trend will make you more $$$ than all the "wiggles" in between. #stocks
425 2018-08-22 20:21:44 Thank you BB. 

I tend to do my #CONTRARIAN #INVESTING /buying when others are doing their selling. Therefore I hope the unloved #stocks that I have been accumulating over the past few months will perform well during the next 3-6 months when volume returns to the #markets.
426 2018-08-22 20:21:29 stocks don't help wages.   working america still struggles with food costs and poor compensation.  #WorkingPoor do not benefit from stocks in regards to every day living conditions.
427 2018-08-22 20:21:03 By one measure, stocks crossed a major threshold on Wednesday. But the financial gains of the decade-long run have been concentrated among the already wealthy.
428 2018-08-22 20:20:26 Best performance day in 2 weeks since I sold all my Chinese stocks . +4% in a choppy summer day specially thanks to $PSTG $TNDM . My portfolio $YEXT $PSTG $ROKU $TNDM $PVTL $ETSY $TWLO . I think $ROKU $PVTL $PSTG $YEXT And probably $TNDM will go much higher these weeks ahead.
429 2018-08-22 20:19:24 Waiting for stocks to move with the price, also a good moment to load up some more. 
Positive day

WH release reads, "At 3,453 days since the S&P 500 hit its low point during the Great Recession, U.S. stocks are poised to surpass their longest-running rally in history."

Math:  3,453/365 = 9 years, 168 days

535 2018-08-22 20:15:10 For those of us not benefiting from owning stocks and being part of your rigged 1%ers. We don’t care. Real jobs, economic growth & responsible non-criminal government is more ... oh and 2+2 still = 4
536 2018-08-22 20:15:04 I think a thanks to @POTUS44 would also be appropriate and the small percentage of American's that invest in stocks , congratulations
537 2018-08-22 20:14:37 Hey, bonespur, how many of your supporters own stocks?
538 2018-08-22 20:14:26 Trump’s victory has been a game changer for stocks. 
539 2018-08-22 20:14:20 Stocks entered this bull market in 2009.
540 2018-08-22 20:13:58 I'd love for 4 stocks, but i think that given how certain MUs work, it would likely make it too easy for timeouts. Unless 80% of the matches end way too quickly, then I'd get that stock count to 4 with 8 minutes. Stage morph as game one sounds better than not being able to..1/2

546 2018-08-22 20:12:48 That doesn’t mean anything to your average worker who doesn’t own any stocks.
547 2018-08-22 20:12:47 As in “the market?” Like stocks?
548 2018-08-22 20:12:37 Stocks just entered the longest-running bull market in history. If you fail to credit that to Trump's presidency then you are seriously grasping at straws.
549 2018-08-22 20:12:08 Stocks are up about 2% this calendar year.  It's an under-performing market
550 2018-08-22 20:10:54 IT'S OFFICIAL:
THE BULL MARKET IN STOCKS IS NOW THE LONGEST EVER.
#TheTRUMPEconomy
551 2018-08-22 20:10:42 Happy to see continued strength in the chip sector.. got back in $AMD on the dip. LOVE $NVDA strength to continue.. #ETFs do not reflect so many bottoming setups and breakouts on the dailys. Once again.. market goes nowhere without FANG stocks!
552 2018-08-22 20:09:44 Yeah, poor people, all of those stocks you buy are really working out for you. Nyuck nyuck!
553 2018-08-22 20:09:34 Fewer than 50% of Americans own any stocks.
554 2018-08-22 20:09:27 Congratulations on you and your friends getting even more ridiculously rich.  

Now, about the 50% of the population that doesn't own any stocks?
555 2018-08-22 20:09:20 Nice late day rally for pot stocks. Might be a busy day tomorrow
556 2018-08-22 20:09:10 Stocks rallied modestly early Wed., then drifted -- apparently not too worried about Trump's future. The Dow eased 88 points, -0.3% to 25,733, while S&P slipped 0.04%. Nasdaq +0.4% as techs attracted cash.

Russell 2000 small-stock +0.2% to another new high.
557 2018-08-22 20:09:07 Tee hee!!!
558 2018-08-22 20:08:27 If they have a 401k or any retirement plan they have money in stocks.  Quit with your theatrics and start doing right by the country.  1 in 2 what a joke.
559 2018-08-22 20:07:56 LONGEST BULL MARKET IN HISTORY...STOCKS UP 322% SINCE MARCH 9, 2009.....   3453 DAYS
560 2018-08-22 20:07:07 I'm okay w/ fees when my profit is larger than the fee. And selling allows me to purchase more stock when I re-buy

I'm similar to you in that I have a few stocks I truly fw - solid companies in solid industries. I'm confident in the bounce back but not scared. Its a game of risk

NASDAQ: 7,889.10 (+ .38%)
566 2018-08-22 20:02:31 Think of your digibytes as stocks instead of a crypto currency. The whole market runs very simmilar to a stock market and investing into a company. I think the volatility is easier to take when you look at digibyte as a whole entity and embrace all its vision for the future.

580 2018-08-22 19:55:22 @jimcramer @MadMoneyOnCNBC quick question: are “value” stocks more dependent on earnings per share and current revenue, whereas “growth” stocks are more dependent on guidance and future estimates? Thanks Jim.
581 2018-08-22 19:55:11 Yes. I'm well aware. You can still kill a lot of people very quickly even having to twitch your index finger. Also, bump stocks still haven't been banned.

I say ban semi-autos, I mean ban semi-autos. Full Autos are already illegal for civilians as they should be.
582 2018-08-22 19:54:34 When you can't talk about how trump has halved the growth of stocks after taking office and passing his tax cuts.
583 2018-08-22 19:53:51 Sounds good. For something a little different my local Waitrose now stocks beers from @BeavertownBeer @WildBeerCo and @fourpurebrewing. All three have some lovely IPAs ranging from light and crispy to seriously hoppy! I would recommend any of their Session IPAs.
584 2018-08-22 19:53:38 “from owning individual stocks” Nobody will want to serve our country. Think about it, you give up a lifetime of work to serve in Congress for what could be a short while? I do agree with the lobbying aspects, Trump’s campaigned on it as well as term limits for Congress.

598 2018-08-22 19:46:35 Stocks are artificially inflated from an unneeded tax break that will come due with huge interest payments on debt to the banks that got the tax break that caused the deficit. When the bubble busts it may be worse than 1929. Meanwhile, income disparity widens further.

680 2018-08-22 19:04:11 Wonder if the rich (who've got lots of stock) or business Insiders aren't deliberately causing stocks to lower so they can buy them back when they hit bottom! ?
681 2018-08-22 19:03:30 Sir 99 % people play stocks on their price not on fundamentals there are only few investor who research understand and have conviction in a business. And if a market leader in   like rain is trading at 7000cr  market cap we cannot imagine how much value will unlock
682 2018-08-22 19:03:15 I know, i FEEL their fees! But they refuse to give us our property, so that is rude and illegal :) . They dont prove anything related to cryptos and they still fk us with the "500$/position in stocks, 2000$ in currencies" etc...

692 2018-08-22 18:57:04 Even Fox news did a segment that states illegals are less likely to commit a crime than natural born citizens. But Id like to remind you we still allow bump stocks  which attributed to 59 deaths and assault rifles which have hundereds dead.

697 2018-08-22 18:52:01 Hey, did you hear about the crazed white man who hoarded assault weapons and modified them with bump stocks to make them fully automatic, and then mowed down scores of concertgoers in Las Vegas?

No? 

The GOP wants to scream like pod people about 1 death by an undocumented?
698 2018-08-22 18:51:24 Well I believe one of the fun facts about me is that even on social media I am known for writing books and writing movie script and YouTube videos, Another thing that I love to do as fun fact, is that I also invest in stock market and buy a lot of stocks as well.
699 2018-08-22 18:51:18 I hear ya.   This deal has violated so many of my standards for so long- and I've dealt with some EPIC scumbag penny stocks- but this may be the weirdest one I've seen.

730 2018-08-22 18:35:38 I agree but the Chinese stocks have been taking a beating due to the tariff talks.  Although IQ is not affected, overall sentiment is bearish.  

I believe in IQ and expect it to do good things.  I bought NFLX at 80 and have held on since.  I believe IQ is similar.

738 2018-08-22 18:32:47 Can't predict 100% what'll happen.  If institutions believe in the company, they'll snatch up shares then, causing the price to rise.  If there's enough selling, like typical stocks, we will see the all time low on or after the lockup period expires, meaning going long then.
739 2018-08-22 18:32:19 What garbage.  This is great news for the wealthy, not so much for the many millions who own little or no stocks.

929 2018-08-22 17:05:38 Robinhood. Free and easy to use. There’s a app called Stockwitz. Kinda like the twitter for stock. Where I kinda hear what people are saying about the different stocks. Don’t weigh their opinions but so heavy. I’ve lost bread trying to follow trends lol

936 2018-08-22 17:02:10 No; the big risk to #stocks is that the bubble they are collapses.
Soaring stocks while incomes near-flat for working-aged and many wages now nil is the housing bubble repeated.  Pure gambling.
937 2018-08-22 17:00:38 CEO says ups&downs is part of stocks.U see, many stock are undervalued many times, but doing nothing & letting things remain as it is, is WRONG on part of mgmt.
#lycosinternet is definitely not investor friendly.
Even DMart, run by R.Damani, SSC pass, is very investor friendly.
938 2018-08-22 17:00:27 Id agree because stocks have been business as usual for the last 24 hours. Do you think the markets have also priced in the trade wars?

941 2018-08-22 17:00:00 Next to diversifying sources of income also adapt investing strategies to that sourcing. For example: with #cryptos I buy and Hold, with my stocks/bonds I use Dollar Cost Averaging and for my retirement fund I use lifecycle investing.
942 2018-08-22 16:59:35 That's for sure. Couple of months to grow grass but will only manage to keep cows out a little longer. No chance of getting a cut of silage to replenish the winter stocks already fed. Growth is back to nearly nothing in these areas with only the odd bit of drizzle falling

947 2018-08-22 16:58:17 All Wealth is dependent upon residential real estate. Unlike Stocks 1000 houses are valued based on what any random 3 of them sell for in a month.  Sadly a world of economists have no idea this is how it works.

969 2018-08-22 16:47:47 yeah but you can never know when the top is...look at the last crash in 2008/2009...you got 6 months when stocks were down 15% to say ok i am done...that would have saved you about 30%...arent you willing to lose 15% at a chance to keep making big gains?

983 2018-08-22 16:42:33 I learned over many years. I teach a lot of them in my videos, but I don’t have a book or guide to send you to for that. I do recommend reading Reminiscence of a Stock Operator, How to Trade in Stocks & The Psychology of the Stock Market though.

1010 2018-08-22 16:27:07 Agree. I'd say the bull market in US stocks don't end in bad news but rather in an euphoria and feel-good story (such as a set of trade deals?) supporting the move.

1023 2018-08-22 16:23:07 For options trading then my advice is consistent. Learn 1 defined risk strategy and trade is super small ($10-100 risk per trade) over and over until you’re bored with tears. Learn to manage and use it with different underlying stocks and ETF. Wait a 6 mo and repeat w/ strategy 2

1027 2018-08-22 16:21:07 I’d agree with you there. I’m a ZSS main and whilst I love the clutch factor of going for a risky grab at high rage, having that advantage on the second stock can feel a little BS. This could possibly be fixed with an Aura-like mechanic of taking stocks into account though.

1145 2018-08-22 15:26:07 When stocks go up their value doesn't get released by shareholders back into the economy. That money largely stays in the market or companies buy back shares. No person or company continues to get rich by selling the stock and putting it into the economy.

1205 2018-08-22 15:02:29 This mkt is ready to explode higher. lot of sectors looking very bullish where the fund managers are buying defensive stocks like XLU and XLP

1207 2018-08-22 15:00:55 SandP 500 trades at 16.5 forward PE. Far from excessive. Implying more upside as analysts revise estimate higher. As they will. US #stocks still looking good.
1208 2018-08-22 15:00:22 Liking the breakout in $ITA, would watch for it to hold. $XAR is stronger though (equal weight A&D I think). Some of the individual stocks are on fire... $AVAV $HEI $TDG $AAXN. Big boys $LMT $RTN $NOC not looking so hot...
1209 2018-08-22 14:59:34 duh.  stocks crashed are on sale.  But only those with cash can afford to play that.  The ones that suffer are the almost retired who panic and sell so the oh so clever to be born rich can buy up their shares.  Only power is to stop buying from public traded companies

Corporations closing up, laying off, or moving overseas.

1216 2018-08-22 14:56:38 The increase was a good thing. Stocks too low heading into winter with booming economy
1217 2018-08-22 14:56:35 Monthly charts of coffee, soybeans, cattle,sugar,etc all look like silver.
I dont think anyone is suppressing it. They legitimately believe it will keep going down,because $ will only keep flowing into stocks. It's a heavily levered wrong bet,like funds who were buying oil at 150
1218 2018-08-22 14:56:35 Also, I hope people realize there's no satisfaction available re: The President. If his head were taken in the stocks of Paris, it would look up from the ground at his body and say 'See? Never touched me.'

1222 2018-08-22 14:55:59 Bruh to be honest I don’t know but so much. I just read a bunch of articles on my stocks and the market in general. Like I didn’t read till it was too late that the market was likely to drop last week cuz it reached a record high or something like that.
1223 2018-08-22 14:55:58 The dow jones transport stocks just reached a new all time record high. Since the transport sector is very sensitive to economic growth, how does that vibe with your theory that the US is collapsing. Open your eyes and do your damn research. Your clients are losing their shirts.

1230 2018-08-22 14:51:20 Point is that those dollars they are printing have to go somewhere. Morons look at the meaningless CPI and say that the extra dollars have no effect. 

Those dollars are going to real estate and stocks, making them more expensive. 

There's nothing for you to argue against.

1232 2018-08-22 14:51:16 you can own real estate stocks (residential reits) in the stock market without owning bricks and mortar real estate with a mortgage and get 90% of the rental income. Non of your arguments stack up. I can always live better without a mortgage.

1429 2018-08-22 13:40:19 Looks like stocks fell 23% over the ensuing 2-3 months but this occurred during the 73-74 bear mkt so not sure what the impact really was (although I’m it didn’t help)

Are you looking for dividend/interest paying stocks? or are you looking for something that would grow in value?
Approx. how much do you want to invest? 
what is your risk tolerance? 
have you invested before?

2. rising rates
3. runaway inflation
4. trade war

1468 2018-08-22 13:23:46 That sounds a reasonable amount. There are theories that as little as 12 Stocks can give you diversification benefits and no more than 20. Only catch is Liquidity in the Real World.

1498 2018-08-22 13:12:39 A more equitable bailout would have helped everyone, not just banks, not just homeowners who held on through the storm.

1551 2018-08-22 12:45:00 U.S. stocks are now trading at 32.8 times long term average earnings. The norm going back to 1881 is 16.8. Unfortunately, valuation is a lousy short term market timing tool. However, it is very reliable when it comes to predicting long-term returns. Expensive market = low returns

1678 2018-08-22 11:32:11 It is not real estate, stocks, mutual funds, businesses, or

With Trump you’ve hit
the treasure trove!

Dinky hands,

But he sure grows
that GDP!

He got your vote

‘cause only growth

Now we’re stuck
with “Head of Rocks”

1694 2018-08-22 11:23:45 Just remember that #stocks now are obviously a bubble.
Soaring stock prices, near-flat wages of those now working, and many jobs now nil-wage is the housing bubble repeating.
1695 2018-08-22 11:22:37 So you don’t think that he or the stocks profit at all from their employees’ conditions? If that’s the case, why don’t million dollar companies just pay a livable wage?

Logic: It had a negatice news flow on monday and the stock reacted downwards by 3 % .Next day it did not breach mondays low and took support at mondays low. It shows minimum downside and can go up futher.

1706 2018-08-22 11:15:17 Thanks. I'll think about it. I got out of stocks after the Recession (barely with my shirt). Kind of lost the stomach for it, and would never trust an advisor again. Do still find it interesting though.
1707 2018-08-22 11:13:49 I was out hunting for bottled water in #Ernakulam today. Supermarkets  poorly stocked. One can get Coke, Fanta, Red Bull, etc but bottled water is difficult to come by. Restaurants seem to have better stocks of bottled water... #KeralaFloods #Kerala

1726 2018-08-22 10:57:29 Plus nobody compared Kejriwal vs Modi. It's just that people "generally" learn from mistakes. Consistently being made laughing stocks due to "internal surveys" and still promoting, is not "being intelligent".

1738 2018-08-22 10:50:45 No but if you included things like real estate or stocks in "currency" the category "currency" would cease to be distinct from "property" and thus useless.

1761 2018-08-22 10:25:32 Coops are also a good idea. I was thinking of that model for my grassroots journals, but it is not clear to me how it would work in practice. 

Would that also mean that every hired person has to invest money in the company? Or would existing personnel lose stocks?

1764 2018-08-22 10:20:46 My theory
A crazy ponzi move is ON.... 15 stocks leading the index. Handful of Mutual funds heavy in those are meeting the performance. Rest all lagging. Retail money still flowing in. Seeks past performing funds. Buys more of those. Those MF have buy  more of those 15.

1820 2018-08-22 09:31:23 @theboltreport  Yes Dutton is good.  Following his appearance on your show X months ago, his stocks went through roof with many Twiteratti suggesting he and Abbott would make good team. That was later expanded to include Hastie & couple of others.  The opportunity is there

1826 2018-08-22 09:27:34 Followed my rules today, but didn't time it right then tried to force a trade and ended up in the red. Stocks went as expected, increase across the ones I was watching, so my rules do work, just the timing needs refinement.

1844 2018-08-22 09:09:31 Whatever little I have learnt from TMF sir is that you should always diversify by having more than 3-4 stocks, each from different sectors. This is coz any system doesn't give linear returns. By having many open positions, % drawdown on entire capital gets managed better

On Keeping Tesla Stocks
On discerning if one should keep Tesla stocks or not, go with Tesla (as private) all the way: This is it. It's a first mover (meaning has the chargers worldwide) and its the iPhone of EVs, it's what people want.
1901 2018-08-22 08:00:01 Rebalancing is also done to check % per asset class. Again, diversify, diversify, diversify. Once a year with regard to mixed stocks/commodities/obligations/bonds portfolios is usually enough. However, with regard to crypto it's a different story imo.
1902 2018-08-22 07:59:16 We switched to soya milk about a year ago. Unfortunately, today I'm using cow's milk because many local shops fail to manage their stocks of unsweetened soya milk. You may be in a position to raise awareness of availability of non-dairy options!

2041 2018-08-22 05:18:06 Many times so called experts have no views. They are just going with the market flow. Individually nthey don't have any idea about market or stocks.

2049 2018-08-22 05:10:22 Dunno.  Most comics (Marvel and DC) from ca. 1948 to 1988 were printed at World Color Press in Sparta IL.  At some point they went from metal to plastic plates, and quality suffered then.  Then (mid 1980s?) they went from newsprint to better paper stocks, and things got better.

This isn't a meritocracy, and you're blind if you can't see that.
2053 2018-08-22 05:05:17 All stocks? I bought some $ATVI instead. $PG for dividends?
2054 2018-08-22 05:03:02 It's not so different that we're past the point of worrying about what happens when enough people don't have homes and enough to eat.
2055 2018-08-22 05:02:54 The Purge.. ring a bell?
2056 2018-08-22 05:01:52 why would the SEC have anything to do with Huma's laptop?  Were they illegally trading stocks?  I'm so confused.
2057 2018-08-22 05:01:04 A way to test this is to look at indy stocks. Numbers get crazy on some midcaps at 100% institutional ($bpmc) but most bigs in high 70s total fund ownership. Passive not all of that. But then some active becoming passive (fido).

2060 2018-08-22 05:00:37 And you would have us go back to that. You'd rather subsidize businesses than take care of our people. You'd risk even more social and political unrest, just to give the handouts to the people who already have money.
2061 2018-08-22 04:59:30 I’m in MoMo for tomorrow’s ER. Hopfully China rebounds
2062 2018-08-22 04:58:08 Google's DRAGONFLY Chinese internet ambitions are very confusing to not only the public but even to Sergey Brin and lots of employees .  We don't know what you are doing as you don't even know yourself ? Are you trying to make your stocks plummet on purpose ?
2063 2018-08-22 04:57:46 This is flawed. Margin can be applied on stocks & others as well, that’s where the price difference you’re seeing comes from. 2x leverage on bitmex compared to no leverage on the stock side.
2064 2018-08-22 04:57:29 The funny part is that shift to automation is already happening, and will continue  regardless of how much or little we're willing to pay people. What's your argument going to be when there simply aren't enough jobs to go around?
2065 2018-08-22 04:57:15 U.S. crude stocks fell last week as refineries hiked output and imports fell, while gasoline inventories decreased and distillate stocks built, data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute showed on Tuesday.
2066 2018-08-22 04:56:38 The Stocks I say! In the public square! Much collective jeering amid the odd rotten tomato splat on the toupee!
2067 2018-08-22 04:55:57 Yeah , had a chat with both management and they were telling stocks looks good.
2068 2018-08-22 04:55:41 all i know is my stocks all jumped into the green today:)

2070 2018-08-22 04:48:58 Check your system with buy and hold.. I think low beta stocks like FMCG simple buy and hold out performs.
2071 2018-08-22 04:48:37 I'm not sure, I can't buy any international stocks with Barclays so haven't really looked into it sorry but this longest rally ever is more of a sign to sell than buy imo.

2074 2018-08-22 04:43:04 I would say strategy working for some stocks only.  So better to do backtest strategy and then based on result we should stick with the one that is giving good risk reward ratio.

Your turn.
2078 2018-08-22 04:39:18 That's the main problem with our situation now..The Representatives have their hands in private prisons .. They get paid for keeping them full.. Ex Governer Keating and his wife were very open about the stocks they had in Oklahoma's private prisons.They made money on the citizens
2079 2018-08-22 04:39:09 Pretty sure he is retired. I think he used to trade stocks.
2080 2018-08-22 04:38:58 I know I'm with them.
They are not the best shorts available.
Hardly any shorts on low float stocks.
If you use them you would know
Or you just after affiliate commissions ???
2081 2018-08-22 04:35:31 Ford, Tesla, GM, FB (only after the big drop), Walmart (before the big pump), Square, Overstock, some REITs, ETFs, a bunch of other stocks. I take a small position in a wide variety of stocks and swing trade them.

2093 2018-08-22 04:21:44 ^ this. 

There is also little differentiation between the same commodity sold by different sellers. A barrel of oil from supplier x is the same as a barrel of oil from supplier y. 

Assets are a broader class - including things (houses, cars, stocks) that are not as fungible.

2097 2018-08-22 04:18:04 I’m guessing this is, in part, driven by the fact it’s still quite hard to get a mortgage approved. So while liquidity is flush in stocks, the real estate market is still pretty choked off despite low mortgage rates.

2103 2018-08-22 04:04:49 don't think of it as dollar down. Think of it as currencies up, risk assets up. This is what's *supposed* to happen--more borrowing of more dollars to buy other currencies and buy bonds and stocks and whatever else in those currencies. And US stocks and commodities.

2144 2018-08-22 03:25:45 I’m obviously not for that type of relationship. I’m afraid investors who should not be trading stocks will begin doing so because it’s easy to do...it’s now a part of the app they use to check their bank accounts.
2145 2018-08-22 03:22:17 Democrats would destroy America over a Hillary loss. Remember when they said accept the results. That was until they lost. We have prosperity, peace, reworked trade deals and NATO funding, great stocks and 401k. Only a fool would take money from their own pockets for Hillary.
2146 2018-08-22 03:21:35 Like feeling sorry over a bad day for stocks for Warren Buffett or Bill Gates.
2147 2018-08-22 03:21:30 That’s where we disagree. Congressperson owning stocks and the bill comes up that will impact the stock. What do you think that congressperson would do?

2149 2018-08-22 03:17:08 Perfect finding. I concur with all your study. Nifty 50 stocks doesn't trend that much becoz, they suffer nifty management. Outsourcing to a low knowledgeable person is way to go. Stop reading newspaper and following unnecessary handle at Twitter is must.

2155 2018-08-22 03:14:45 Does this mean that one should start looking at quality real estate stocks?
2156 2018-08-22 03:13:39 Absolutely... blindly buy good stocks. Do you expect this to be the trend for the whole of 2018?
2157 2018-08-22 03:13:29 Wasn't a horse & buggy company one of the highest stocks on Wall Street when the 1st automobile was made? The fossil fuel industry is 19th century. Time to move on to 21st cent. tech to clean up our power sources. The tech is here. Dinosaur juice is so last millenium.

2162 2018-08-22 03:11:00 Imagine if Warren's proposal was current law, and then some member of congress proposed changing the law to allow members to own stocks - that would be rightly seen as very suspicious and corrupt. Therefore, this is a good idea.

2170 2018-08-22 03:04:18 .@kamal1chawla @beastoftraal I got my Kirana guy to order. There is ONE store in 18 in my neighborhood who stocks non-cadbury and nestle. I spotted the orange bars in his fridge, he immediately called his supplier and ordered a box of a dozen bitter
2171 2018-08-22 03:03:21 Then who is responsible for maintenance of property that is collective? Also, a lot of people like the idea of owning their own homes. What makes you entitled to my property?

2174 2018-08-22 03:00:55 I won't happen like that.  The US has to present itself in the most dignified way possible, humiliation of the Chief Executive won't help anything.  Don't misread this as support, I'd like to see him dragged out in the street and thrown in the stocks. But that's just me.

- Defame stuff that works ie. cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, zcash (also, lets not use this word loosely)
- People losing their savings (why people put more money in crypto over stocks beats me)
2182 2018-08-22 02:57:20 3. Your last sentence. I had a kid with down syndrome make a successful business making socks. Now if this kid can do it the only reason anyone couldn't be marginally successful is they're either a) a drooling vegetable or b) A self-entitle Leftist. End of Discussion.

2184 2018-08-22 02:55:38 2. Nobody wants to overpay for products and services especially when talent is questionable. There is a happy medium between products and price points. Exceed it, no one will buy. Ask GM. They got a bailout for making overpriced crappy cars that nobody really wanted.

2188 2018-08-22 02:53:42 1/ What a shame you have no understanding of what profit and profit margin is before and after EBITDA under GAAP rules. Companies exist to make money not provide jobs. Jobs are created because the company has discovered a niche where people want the product.

2190 2018-08-22 02:51:13 7. Most of us that earned a nice living by doing the right things, taking the risks and reaping the rewards are very much willing to ex-pat out rather than give you handouts because you think you "deserve" something. You don't deserve a thing for breathing.

2192 2018-08-22 02:50:02 6, You want $15/hr? Be prepared to see massive unemployment and a serious shift to temp workers. And lemme guess..you also want to sock us all for free health care, right? Yeah..be prepared to be experience dystopia instead of utopia.
2193 2018-08-22 02:49:00 Been a while since you heard from us, right? We are in the process of changing our business model, from just sharing news to giving deeper analysis on stocks though OPINIONS.

A restaurant in a moderate traffic zone would need to make at least $4000 a day, every day, to accommodate a crew averaging 4 to 6 employees per shift. They have to account for fixed variables.
2198 2018-08-22 02:46:01 I can’t wait for 2019. Stocks falling, federal debt sky rocketing, jobs going out of style - ahhh... finally we will realize why trickle down economics doesn’t work. Sorry folks - especially you guys in W. Virginia. Wish everyone well but this @POTUS is fraud. See it. Or ...
2199 2018-08-22 02:45:58 buying stock is a risk. insider trading is for greedy scumbags. you can limit stocks if you want. I have said for yrs have what I call an avg Joe/Judy clause where a blue collar person is on a company board. too many elites line each others pockets just as much as Congress.
2200 2018-08-22 02:44:30 3. You have zero understanding of Supply Chain. 15/hr across the board impacts every facet of commerce. Every area of distribution and transportation takes the hit. Every logistics facility takes the hit. We would have no choice but to raise prices dramatically to cover..
2201 2018-08-22 02:44:04 Purchased my first stocks and did really well on all my mock fantasy football drafts today! Probably means I’m going to die tomorrow or some shit.
2202 2018-08-22 02:44:00 She isn’t talking about the people. She is talking about governmental officers owning stocks and voting bills to make a profit for themselves. Do you endorse this act of corruption?
2203 2018-08-22 02:42:56 2. Our world is different now. Convenience and technology is the order of the day. The number of low skill/no skill workers is vast. A fast food worker today is not worth $15/hr because they can never produce $15/hr worth of labor. And since you went down this road..
2204 2018-08-22 02:41:04 The jokes just wrote themselves. Cannabis stocks:  buy low, sell...high??
2205 2018-08-22 02:40:38 1. That was a different time when we became the predominant economic power. Men and women had skills that were needed and necessary. Low skill/no skill workers were forced to learn a trade or live in shanty towns with little hope of success or a future.

2212 2018-08-22 02:35:01 I prefer term limits.  you can put up plenty of firewalls and yearly attestation for stock ownership. plus stocks can like lose value. oh and insider trading laws can be used. so yeah, term limits wins.

2231 2018-08-22 02:20:50 Bump stocks were never an issue before Las Vegas, that’s why there was never a push to confiscate them.

2236 2018-08-22 02:14:43 He actually had his AFT approve the sale of bump stocks which were used in the Last Vegas Massacre.

He would not try to pass anything other than unconstitutional laws but ignored school safety, security measures.

Also see Obama "Promise Program" which enabled school shooting.

2251 2018-08-22 02:08:34 No corp. Paid near 39% with all the deductions available to them. If you have stocks in your 401k you are a share holder of the companies you have stocks in. I am middle class i recieved a nice raise and a bonus but i can only speak for myself.

2265 2018-08-22 01:52:03 21% corporate tax rate decreased from 39% and they don’t want to give their employees a raise? They buy back stocks to boost economy (bubble) only benefit is to shareholders. Who also benefit from all the exceptions in the tax cut on inherited wealth. Middle class gets screwed.

2284 2018-08-22 01:34:11 I need some help in understanding the indices driving Tesla stocks. I just can’t wrap my head around it’s spread!
2285 2018-08-22 01:32:34 30,000 Americans are killed each year by guns, AR 15s, bump stocks. OUR GUN LAWS ARE A DISGRACE.
2286 2018-08-22 01:31:21 Ok....I'm dumb. Why the huge divergence between this and, say the Russell 3000? Thought US stocks broadly at ATH's.  One include debt instruments?

2288 2018-08-22 01:29:15 Rabastan was in his office reviewing some stocks before seeing Rebellatrix pop in. Removing his thick rimmed glasses, he nodded his head. 

"Sure, have a seat." Putting out his cigarillo, he cleared his throat as he leaned back in his chair »

2295 2018-08-22 01:25:00 Very few shorters of those two stocks though, fortunately. Short interest been trending down into the result too.
2296 2018-08-22 01:24:53 If growth oriented higher beta stocks are near and at all time highs with new stocks breaking out daily, THAT is typically a great indication of a healthy market no matter what the news wants you to believe. Follow the leaders and let them tell you what the market condition is.
2297 2018-08-22 01:22:50 esl is up $15 from when I started, can my anniversary hurry up so I can automatically buy them stocks 
2298 2018-08-22 01:21:17 Ahhh. Pero para estimacion actividad a la no tan larga no impacta. La variación negativa de stocks se resta de la producción.

2310 2018-08-22 01:13:07 Pot stocks - some nice moves today as I see in one scan. Still like $CRON in this space. Saw some 2K+ September 10 calls. Still like them in the weekly/monthly timeframes.
2311 2018-08-22 01:11:55 True, but I wish you all would get just as worked up for the American mass murderers who have killed almost triple the amount of women, children and men with their bump stocks and AR-15's!
2312 2018-08-22 01:11:31 Don’t be surprised if we have to have four if not five stocks.
2313 2018-08-22 01:10:23 I was prohibited from doing doing that as an employee of both financial services and Big 5 accounting firms.  I had much less access to information that could move stocks and markets, so it's a no brainer.  I was shocked it wasn't a rule already.
2314 2018-08-22 01:10:06 Futures markets barely down. A ho hum from stocks.
2315 2018-08-22 01:03:38 Talk about stocks that’s why you exist.
2316 2018-08-22 01:03:27 Huh. A quick search and this is apparently a piece from the defunct Nintendo Network for banking and stocks. It had a Famicom board built in but used data cards instead of carts.
2317 2018-08-22 01:03:11 Good thought process on your end. Personally, I will use VWAP as just one aspect of a buy or sell order. But the history of VWAP on that specific stock will often dictate if price action history will repeat itself. For some stocks it will, others it will not.
2318 2018-08-22 01:02:32 Today was a huge case of F.O.M.O on my trades. I’m very disappointed in myself for not following my own mentors daily strategy. I should’ve been more patient. Tomorrow’s plan : Trade after 945am+follows his plans+ Trade only 2-3 stocks no excuses. Again this is at work. #Plans
2319 2018-08-22 01:01:30 Joe Biden did this when he was first elected in 1972. He hasn't owned stocks since.

2321 2018-08-22 01:00:37 Buying low P/E stocks works in both good markets & bad. You may have to wait a little longer for your return in a bear market. -- Chris Browne
2322 2018-08-22 01:00:26 Inflation/hiking/Bretton Woods ending. The more interesting scenario to worry about in 2018 is inflation and hiking. We already have wage pressure... add a housing shortage and add a mildly strong economy = inflation and more hiking. Arguably bad for stocks.
2323 2018-08-22 01:00:22 Buy some property, buy some stocks that pay dividends and pay all my debt.
2324 2018-08-22 01:00:01 how would you lose 40% more stocks from ucf please tell me lol

2326 2018-08-22 00:58:57 The Las Vegas mass murderer? No outrage there? No protections? Can't even deal with bump stocks.
2327 2018-08-22 00:58:25 Que si se redujeran los stocks de poroto la caída del procesamiento podría amortiguarse al menos parcialmente.

2329 2018-08-22 00:52:52 I live in Indian Country.  Specifically near the Navajo Res.  Besides, yes, when a redneck stocks up on huge arsenals, sure they get to use about 100 rounds of the tens of thousands stocked up, and the armed professionals usually take them out in less than a dozen bullets.

2335 2018-08-22 00:43:41 The least prepared scenario is a pullback that is bought and then sold off harder . That’s what this market needs . Stocks with 50 plus Pe’s is not a market of worry

2340 2018-08-22 00:40:12 Thanks! Was hoping for something a bit more tangible like "dont buy stocks that have an X or a T in the ticker name when mercury is in retrograde." But then again, I'm from a country that drives on the "wrong side of the road". No wonder I'm having all these collisions in the OTC
2341 2018-08-22 00:39:50 Brazilian currency (real) and stocks getting completely whacked and the market is focused on chump change paid to carnival strippers.
2342 2018-08-22 00:37:07 The single most bullish scenario required scary headlines and stocks opening in the hole tomorrow.  IF they can reverse the tape higher, it'll tell you all you need to know.  My sense is too many people playing for the breakout to reward the obvious but we'll see.  $SPX $NDX
2343 2018-08-22 00:36:50 “Can you explain stocks to her?” “....uh yeah they’re like socks except longer.”
2344 2018-08-22 00:36:15 @Steven1_994 you track lots of metrics. How you find these patterns/tickers to track? Do you just browse through random stocks and try to find these patterns?
2345 2018-08-22 00:35:23 Don't marry your stocks.
2346 2018-08-22 00:34:18 Next couple of days trading will be important to watch your size. Market pulled on Cohen news but fundamentals of companies didn't change, e/r haven't changed. If market gets too bearish u could see buying come in on cheap stocks & squeeze i.e. 2/9-2/16.
2347 2018-08-22 00:33:55 I loaded up on $CNAB #weed #stocks are smoking nowbut I started like a month ago lol when no one was in.
2348 2018-08-22 00:33:49 Is owning stocks the problem, or inside trading in those stocks (which is illegal for anyone)?
2349 2018-08-22 00:33:31 I hear spray tan stocks are boomin! Get rid of those tan lines, ya know, where the cuffs go?
2350 2018-08-22 00:33:22 Was this pre-market? Gotta check if so cause not all stocks on IB trade pre-market
2351 2018-08-22 00:30:16 i dont see anything to kill the bull rally. But corrections happen all the time. Good earnings and you are slaughtered, bad earnings you are buried. Big beat is the only time stocks go up. So this is good and corrections happen all the time in every stock imo 
2352 2018-08-22 00:29:04 1 thing I learned about MJ stocks. They walk to the tune of a different drum, I locked my CRON shares today, but am 50/50 on a gap and go tomorrow despite the market.

2354 2018-08-22 00:26:51 It’s 30 companies, it’s not the stock market noob. It is a skewed view of the overall market because of how it weights stocks. For example, Apple had a significantly larger impact on the DJIA than say GE did before it was removed. Try at minimum paying attention to the S&P500.
2355 2018-08-22 00:26:15 Just because an index moves.. it doesn't mean every stock will move at the same time. Let the stocks guide you.

2364 2018-08-22 00:19:32 My friends always ask me what stocks they should buy.... I honestly don’t have one Stock I would recommend today. The #StockMarket is at all time highs while the #USA Debt is also breaking new high. The fundamentals just don’t warrant a strong Market. Smoke and Mirrors!
