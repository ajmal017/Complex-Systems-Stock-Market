10 2018-07-24 23:44:32 Oooh. Bump stocks.
That victory is Huuuge!
11 2018-07-24 23:43:44 Too much global stocks. We are our own worst enemies.
12 2018-07-24 23:43:30 Stocks close slightly higher, trimming earlier gains
13 2018-07-24 23:43:00 Trump’s policies have removed the uncertainty from businesses and therefore it’s helped stocks some. But I do believe a recession is coming and it’ll be liberalism’s fault again—college debt is over a trillion and people aren’t paying it back.
14 2018-07-24 23:42:02 Exactly. We had a strong economy with almost full employment so tax cuts were not needed. Tax cuts are usually needed to stimulate a sluggish economy. These tax cuts, 84% to the wealthy, are just being used to buyback stocks & give bonuses to CEOs. Minimal increase in wages.
15 2018-07-24 23:41:27 I agree. Many strong stocks and etfs got hammered while the NASDAQ broke even. But let's be patient and see the next days
16 2018-07-24 23:40:46 I wish trump wasn’t an asshole. But his policies—other than the tariffs—have been effective. Obama loved to tout the stock market, but now a trump gets no credit for it. POTUS’ have limited effect on stocks but they have some.
17 2018-07-24 23:40:03 It’s like he wants to destroy his own company. Without MAGA twitter stocks drop 80% overnight.

39 2018-07-24 23:36:14 I've had $kat on my watchlist for awhile. Just haven't pulled the trigger, I keep wanting to buy weed stocks.
40 2018-07-24 23:32:18 Federal revenue is down, despite stocks and job growth being up. 

Remind me again how a good economy means we can afford to protect farmers from Trump'a trade war?

Sounds like he's just giving away more of what isn't his in the first place.
41 2018-07-24 23:31:37 Got back to the hotel from being a pipeliner all day , and I purchased some stocks of General Electric because they are pretty low right now... I’m different, yeah I’m different.
42 2018-07-24 23:28:44 It boggles me that people... and i mean adults, think that a a good stock market means a good economy and vice versa. 

Literally saw a guy rambled about how awesome the economy is right now because stocks are up.... homie.. WE BEEN IN A BULLS MARKET FOR YEEEEAARS
43 2018-07-24 23:28:27 $CBLK $BILI $ZUO $BB $ACIA $GLD $OSTK $SEDG  Some stocks that I'm continuing  to avoid here and likely for some time to come.
44 2018-07-24 23:27:54 And how is that going to work with the exploding deficit, while corporations are on a spending spree buying back stocks?
45 2018-07-24 23:27:17 Sell that shit put ur money in a bank or with real stocks
46 2018-07-24 23:26:07 Competition is super important to bring the product cost down. That will take some time.. The extra  money can be reinvested in new businesses, in research and development, in stocks and bonds. The money will not be wasted.

49 2018-07-24 23:19:30 Not sure who that was directed to - me or PSK

I've been back at full time trading now 1.5 years roughly. Traded futures for many years in my 20s, went back to corp America & found my way back to trading stocks (no futures).

61 2018-07-24 23:08:43 The AIM-9L was already in our possession. Missiles supplied by the US simply replenished the NATO stocks back in the UK. We fought the Falklands on our own with the equipment we had. Thanks NATO!
62 2018-07-24 23:08:19 Unlike Canada California Can’t have pistol grips, flash suppressor, folding collapsing telescoping stocks and a vertical grip. Sbs and Sbrs are legal in Canada but illegal in California
63 2018-07-24 23:08:02 The rise in yields had an evident impact on stocks. Financials were the best performing sector, while utilities were among the worst.
64 2018-07-24 23:05:48 The fundamental drivers of P/E are the expected earnings growth rate and the required rate of return. 
Check out PEG, the ratio of the P/E to the consensus growth forecast. Stocks with low PEGs are more attractive.
Check potential for PE expansion, the key driver of mega returns
65 2018-07-24 23:04:48 He definitely desires innovation. And seems at least to me, to be trying to do good. His public remarks about the valuation of his company were honest. But, stocks like Tesla are a sign that the markets are broken... so there’s that.

71 2018-07-24 22:57:22 I try to avoid anyone who talks about that kind of stuff, it's above my pay grade... Personally the sounds that get my goat are lip smacking and people eating with their mouths open, total heathens that should be put in the stocks and pelted with rancid fruits.
72 2018-07-24 22:55:24 Stocks??

Tariffs ... example:

Whirlpool shares down 10%.
Whirlpool products - price increase = 20%
73 2018-07-24 22:54:21 “Why didn’t you, Trump, ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?”
74 2018-07-24 22:54:09 Boots the Chemists sells perfumes, doesn't it? Have they checked their stocks since he went in there to get his medication?
75 2018-07-24 22:53:12 They won't be happy when the tariffs kick in. Neither will people who own stocks....

78 2018-07-24 22:51:05 Lies and the farm bill will take it away if they ever get a raise. Company bought stocks back with that money . No raise coming. Sorry.
79 2018-07-24 22:49:29 The price of a stock increases because there are more buyers than sellers and vice versa when in fact the number of stocks being sold is the same as the number of stocks being bought (explaining so this tweet doesn't make me look like an idiot when viewed out of context )
80 2018-07-24 22:47:06 What’s high capacity?

And banning bump stocks will not do what you want it to...
81 2018-07-24 22:46:53 If you win the lottery tonight, do the following: 

1.) Collect the lump sum in a private trust and dont tell anyone

2.) Wait for economy to tank 

3.) When stocks are low invest 90% of earnings with a top tier hedge fund. Use other 10% for play money

4.) Become a billionaire
82 2018-07-24 22:44:52 And me.  Hubby is stocking up on beer and wine and gin, but every time we see the News those stocks go down.  Cheers!
83 2018-07-24 22:44:51 Protect their profits. Health care stocks will take a beating and may destabilize the markets. Any new system will have glitches and there will be winners and losers but we must find a way forward. The welfare of all future Americans relies on -

106 2018-07-24 22:27:56 I've been working on a Draft Blog tonight about how as Investors we cling to prior beliefs and do not adjust quickly. Works 2 ways - we hold on to poor Stocks as they get worse and we fail to see a positive story emerging especially after previous poor performance of that  stock.
107 2018-07-24 22:27:43 @jimcramer Booyah Jim, You currently express ethical problems with owning PM or other cigarette stocks. Why do you recommend owning a basket of cannabis stocks without the same ethical reservations?

112 2018-07-24 22:25:19 an update on the markets: the stocks did a good money today, and now have more money. tech has gone bad, as it has every quarter since patrick's macbook died. health is only kratom pills now. this has been your market update.

(could be fake news)
On March 23rd Dow hit 23,533 today 25,241+1,700 points or 7.3%
On April 2nd NASDAQ hit 6870 today 7840 +970 points or 14.1%

127 2018-07-24 22:03:58 Agree that it had a negative effect on price. Probably disagree on whether the drop was justified. iirc, the bulk of the shares mentioned in the prospectus were for previously announced convertible notes that don't convert as long as the note is repaid.

135 2018-07-24 21:57:44 I need someone to explain to me  why the anti-socialist think it’s a bad thing to fund programs for those in need but it’s a great thing to fund corporate welfare? Our tax dollars are needed to cover for what they don’t pay. They use the tax break to invest in stocks not economy!

141 2018-07-24 21:51:28 I understand that people want to burn corporate for siding with Trump on these tariffs. However, please have some empathy for those employed by the company. They have no control over stocks plummeting. These are people who have families and bills. Lay offs can be debilitating.

148 2018-07-24 21:48:27 So glad I made my way to penny stocks. Only 1 red day since i started trading them.

$106 dollar loss on Friday. New platform. The trade window displayed the stock that I was trying to order, but the order was executed for the wrong stock!

All green besides that! + $212 today!

154 2018-07-24 21:46:30 Believe it or not but 2H18 $SPY EPS growth ests holding steady is a positive for stocks. Why? First, the bar is super high and by not having ests cut it indicates well above trend growth will persist. Second, prior to this year, $SPY EPS ests were cut in every quarter for 6 yrs!
155 2018-07-24 21:45:32 And the stocks.
156 2018-07-24 21:44:54 No, but a few pre-plane stocks may help the flight to Fort Myers seem a lot shorter!
157 2018-07-24 21:44:35 With all due respect to those who attend #Mets games (to each his own).

Crazy that #Mets are 14th in MLB attendance. Should be last. One of the biggest laughing stocks in sports. Wilpons dont deserve your money. Statement needs to be made to Wilpons, front office, and team.
158 2018-07-24 21:43:44 Does this colleague also have ShotStopper stocks yet?
159 2018-07-24 21:42:31 Of course it is borrowing. Aka selling more us debt, stocks and bonds.

Which will mature, and have be repaid with interest, by the middle class.

So yes it is borrowing, moron.
160 2018-07-24 21:42:03 Exactly. Had to say the same to my group.  Stop calling them “marijuana” stocks.  Aurora Cannabis in town next week. Hope you got a 1x1.

162 2018-07-24 21:40:19 Little Trump & even Littler Sessions, all your money, glutany, hotels, botox, tanning, golf clubs, greed, gold fixtures, properties, accounts, stocks, and whatever else you ‘have’ will EVER make you one oz. as good or worthy as a human being compared to the ones you put in cages.
163 2018-07-24 21:39:47 i think they are happy with the result, stocks higher than ever, generating more and more revenue, 2 massive tv deals for their shows, more globally known than ever

and you should never be for fans at any type of show hijacking it
164 2018-07-24 21:39:22 Of course not. Just funny how the Trump supporters tout stock performance when a discussion on the economy comes up. Many of them are low to middle class individuals who average less than 20k in assets like Stocks, 401k, IRA etc. Doesn't really help that demographic.
165 2018-07-24 21:38:37 Little Trump, all your money, glutany, hotels, botox, tanning, golf clubs, greed, gold fixtures, properties, accounts, stocks, and whatever else you ‘have’ will EVER make you one oz. as good or worthy of a human compared to the ones you put in cages.
166 2018-07-24 21:38:13 #Globe and Mail wins the category of worst stock market commentary of the day "Canada’s main stock index fell on Tuesday as a decline in industrial stocks countered a modest rise in industrial stocks. The S&P/TSX composite index fell by 0.19 per cent to 16,390.13." Hard to argue.
167 2018-07-24 21:37:43 So what about stocks and investing in real estate? If you’re trying to bring up a moral issue you have to throw in literally every other kind of investment vehicle into the conversation

171 2018-07-24 21:36:28 $DPW previously telegraphed their share offerings with an S-3 before July 23 evening's latest filing, but point of fact ~ it still was a negative catalyst on the stock (it traded down after hours 7/23) until their contract news this morning helped cushion the blow afterwards.
172 2018-07-24 21:35:29 Careful wording.
Government may be advising that supermarkets keep larger stocks of non-perishable food and medicine, that suppliers bulk-order in advance, but TECHNICALLY it's wrong to suggest that government Itself is stockpiling food. They just advise everybody else does.

Could you please share (today or tomorrow) your thoughts on which things you're seeing? Is it RSI and MACD negative divergence or something else like GAP-n-CRAP?
250 2018-07-24 20:54:37 Trump always saying that he's creating jobs, stocks are up, economy is great, blah blah... then why there is a bailout as emergency aid? 
251 2018-07-24 20:53:25 See her bumming cigarettes, On the sidewalk where she sits
Said to take these credit cards of mine, And stick'm whar the sun don't shine
She don't want my bonds and stocks, Living in her cardboard box
Lord, she'd rather be homeless, than here at home with me

255 2018-07-24 20:51:36 Seems like growth = tech stocks, value = boring large caps regardless of price
256 2018-07-24 20:51:17 At this rate I'd get your order in for a pitchfork and some matches asap - can't see stocks lasting if this nonsense continues...
257 2018-07-24 20:50:22 I called it a dump - TOTALLY UNTRUE. Health Insurance stocks, which have gone thro….
258 2018-07-24 20:50:01 I have a very small amount of savings in stocks. The idea of saving money at a bank with a negative investment rate after i flation is ludicrous.
259 2018-07-24 20:49:58 if this happens they should put all those @Jacob_Rees_Mogg Boris DD etc in the stocks.  Not that we will have anything to throw at them #brexitshambles

264 2018-07-24 20:47:50 SHE NEVER SAID RAISE TAXES TO 50%. SHE NEVER SAID THAT. 90% OF AMERICANS ARE NOT FEELING AN INCREASE !! It's all bullshit.Everything is going up, gas, interest rates , food, rent, etc. And wages are stagnan.The winners are the TOP 10% as always. They reinvested in their stocks.

268 2018-07-24 20:47:04 Agreed Marcelo. This divergence, though atypical, has happened before. I've watched trading houses dump large volumes of #uranium #stocks into market, depressing prices & inducing capitulation in order to create cheapest re-entry, just before re-buying in much higher volumes!
269 2018-07-24 20:46:16 196 stocks hit new 52wk highs today (@Barchart) , 106 (54%) of those closed down. Seems like a high percentage. $spy
270 2018-07-24 20:45:38 I'm torn. A full 75% of voters in the farm belt voted for Trump. To what degree should they reap what they've sown? (Ha!) I know there are national security / social safety net implications associated with national food stocks. But. Maybe they should get what they asked for. #p2

I mean that is so far beyond what Graham and Dodd considered to be value, it's absolutely ludicrous, it's over 2x the value Graham would buy at
274 2018-07-24 20:43:41 Algos are triggered to bring down stock market where Trump tweets or Washington announces have negative meaning. The same for defense stocks. AlGo codes are based on NK. Peace is great though. We should all live happily after

277 2018-07-24 20:42:29 Michael Decter was on BNN the other day touting weed stocks as great investments. I understand part of the business involves a little bit of salesmanship, however, I will never forget when Mr Decter went on BNN in 2015 and said Patient Home will be on the Nasdaq within a year .
278 2018-07-24 20:42:26 @AmyAtrades Thank you for all the chart work today.  Curious your thoughts on WUBA; seemed to buck the trend for most Chinese stocks with better than average volume.  Again, thanks for any chart intel you can provide.

284 2018-07-24 20:38:07 one thing that isn't discussed enough, is that all of the securities that are included in the "value" categories are not truly value stocks.  Ben Graham and David Dodd invented value investing, they created strict parameters to define a value stock, of which none are followed
285 2018-07-24 20:37:22 Life is crazy. I have so much money, and even more stocks. I'm serious!
286 2018-07-24 20:36:43 I love that your feed occasionally feels like a 5 films for £10 bin in the kind of store that stocks Live Love Laugh mural stickers.

333 2018-07-24 20:12:41 Go read the financial section today.  It’s not prettty
-gov has to give farmers billions to offset damage done by tariffs
- housing prices down 11% in California 
- bubble in credit market will send stocks down
You need to get out of your rich man bubble and see the real world
334 2018-07-24 20:12:34 Just a thought:  with all/ most of the 13’s in Indices / stocks - with exception of NFLX- it would be insightful where the flip down levels are.  Not random 2 day VWAP, or pullbacks after huge moves
335 2018-07-24 20:12:29 And the Tory government is making sure there are adequate food stocks to feed the population, despite Brexit apparently.
336 2018-07-24 20:12:25 This is not an overnight get rich stock.  Even good stocks take time before it starts moving again.  Probably folks that got in a few weeks ago when this was at trip zeros selling, not recognizing the full potential.

385 2018-07-24 19:52:18 You can’t get non recourse loans to buy stocks.. which means you don’t pay anything back they just take the property.
386 2018-07-24 19:52:15 At some point housing prices will correlate around their rent per sft, for Either living or yield value.  The context for living is cost of owning against renting and context for yield is often dividend stocks or Corp bond rates.

425 2018-07-24 19:36:56 Too bad you supported the #TaxScam. 
$600 billion dollars worth of stocks bought back by corporations and given to their share holders.
Real wages fell 1.8%.
Only the wealthy (your friends) have benefited from your tax scam.

428 2018-07-24 19:35:25 Oh great! Start a trade war that makes it necessary to subsidize farmers with funds that could be used for other things, cut funding for healthcare, give tax breaks to the rich who then use it to buyback their own stocks. Trump’s America!
429 2018-07-24 19:35:16 For goodness sake. We already do it for medicines, blood, blood products etc. Day to day demand is buffered by stocks held in hospitals, pharmacies and wholesalers.
430 2018-07-24 19:34:56 FANG stocks continue to be very strong
431 2018-07-24 19:34:15 My guess is he made a killing of Trump winning. Put out fake info market will crash if he wins and buy up stocks of panicked dems off the inital sell off. Was actually a pretty good idea
432 2018-07-24 19:33:02 Ha! I voted for trump to help the little guy and he only gives huge corporate tax cut to rich who hoarded profits overseas then exchanged worthless printed stocks for those profits *only after* trump let them bring that$ to America at much lower tax rates. ONLY the rich rule USA
433 2018-07-24 19:32:58 @CNBCClosingBell Spot on Sarah. Harley Davidson obviously had a great quarter despite the fact they’re complaining and impatient about very small tariffs. Earnings have been fantastic across the board. That’s why the markets should keep climbing. Especially metal stocks
434 2018-07-24 19:31:47 Liked your chart. Could you send it to Pence, Trum and Ryan? Corps. are not using  cut to invest in US based plants etc. but are buying up their own stocks. The very rich probably just stick theirs in a trust fund; and folks like me hardly notice the trickle down.
435 2018-07-24 19:31:24 $DRUS you exited too early! the #squeeze has just started Today! $EMPM need to see some updates! Good luck

445 2018-07-24 19:26:58 Large caps in #Nasdaq are the winners today, but there are a lot of companies which will publish earnings the next days. That can have an impact on index. Don't trust small indices - trust #stocks.

447 2018-07-24 19:25:30 Umm . Did you say “corporations” are having a positive outlook? Manufacturing has a positive outlook, I see. And using tax cuts to buy back stocks for stronger appeal has nothing to do with job loss. Sure does help to have you treat us like dummies. Sell out. 
448 2018-07-24 19:24:59 Most sectors and stocks are positive on the day. Yes, they pulled back from highs but everything is still very much in the positive. So TRIN will stay low. When things actually turn negative that is when TRIN will move.

453 2018-07-24 19:22:27 Easy - $CWS has underperformed $SPY since its existence. You took out $MSFT this year, which turned out to be one of the best performing stocks YTD. Also, I'm old enough to remember when you'd recommend people own $TSLA ("a small amount") in their portfolios...
454 2018-07-24 19:21:35 There's no reason for anyone not to be financially educated. Don't put yourself in debt, and don't work for money.

459 2018-07-24 19:17:11 Worse still are the perma bears and short sellers who seem to be married to obvious stocks and attached to consensus ideas. Lighten up and make some money. It’s a lot more fun!
460 2018-07-24 19:16:19 I find it ironic that most of  the companies that bitching about tariffs are companies that have been struggling and their stocks prices are depressed or have been for some time.
Could it be do to inept management?

germans public in general aren‘t even aware of how to short stocks (only instruments here to do this is cfds and puts). pension funds will not short stocks here, extremely unlikely. without a source i don‘t buy that

519 2018-07-24 18:47:46 it was made by competent people but someone who only cared for stocks sold distributed the alpha/beta instead of the final code and didn't leave a skeleton crew to fix the game because "they lost the final code" but in reality just wanted the quick cash

522 2018-07-24 18:46:38 The ACA got more people health insurance, including students/young adults thru age 26. Trump's tax cuts benefit the rich. Middle class see temporary gains of $20, $50, & temporary decreases in income tax. I have no extra $$ to invest in stocks so I don't care how market is doing.

525 2018-07-24 18:45:15 @mrjamesob 
Even if you could convince the Brexiteers in to a Damascine Epiphany do you seriously imagine that Barnier, Brussels et al would welcome us back with open arms without making an example of us? We'd be thrown in the stocks not the naughty step.
526 2018-07-24 18:43:03 It appears that the market has been fairly discriminating: "With the exception of Helen of Troy, the other five stocks have underperformed the Russell 2000 in 2018."

If there is inefficiency, it's not in these examples. Capital equipment manufacturers aren't the where gains are.
527 2018-07-24 18:42:53 It doesn’t support working families of the rich keep the money or buy back their own stocks. Is this what #PutinsApprentice wants you to push?

530 2018-07-24 18:41:48 As a supply chain consultant it is unrealistic to expect business to increase their stocks by more than 2-3 days on average due to cash cost and lack of storage facilities. Absurd

535 2018-07-24 18:40:55 @jimcramer ..Jim, can u opine on why the Nasdaq rolled over from up over 80 to down 20?

She stops & eyes him. “Alas, my calling is #onymancy, & it appears torture has seen your fingernails removed.” She strikes his fingers with her cane. “Besides, it takes no skill to tell your future.”

540 2018-07-24 18:39:27 Let's just say we enter a bear market in US stocks today.  That is 'results oriented' and a coincidence.  The evidence from the charts still shows a bull market.  So even if JC is "wrong", how can you blame JC for believing in his chart analysis across the board?

"as stocks climb"
"as yields rise"
"as dollar rises"
"as hot money flees" 
"as no one cares" 
"ETF outflows"
Reality: Maybe the best reasons to own gold just aren't there today.

More i use traderslounge, more i respect u for building it

Just one q: I was looking at today's option data, and IVs mentioned for few stocks didn't match with NSE closing data. infact the diff was quite significant. e.g.ASIANPAINT has IV of 55 

(1/2)
579 2018-07-24 18:24:52 If Trump slaps tariffs on clothing right after this, means he told Ivanka, which is illegal. Already happened once before, one of Trump's friend sold all his stocks in steel right before the tariffs
580 2018-07-24 18:23:44 Oil is a fungible world resource.  Trump really hasn't got much "control" of it.  And good thing you are not "Ark" and invest only in unicorns.  Keeping an eye on fiduciary responsibilities for your customers - is a good thing.  Make them money incl in good dividend core stocks.

589 2018-07-24 18:19:04 Buffett made his fortune buying consumer levered growth stocks during an inflationary period with other people's money. It ix rewriting history to call him a value investor.
590 2018-07-24 18:18:52 Someone will have to pay for the stockpiling... I think we can guess who. Us. Stocks need to be stored, that's a cost to manufacturers and wholesale/ retailers who will have to pass on the costs to the end consumers...

595 2018-07-24 18:17:37 If the 1% stopped hoarding cash and paid people a living wage, those people would then buy more things. Rich bastards squirrel away everything. Regular people SPEND their money on goods, real estate, stocks, etc.

637 2018-07-24 17:54:21 I don't think you know how stocks work. You also need to realize the world doesn't care about whatever moron is elected to be president and the world isn't going to end. Obama was treated special because he ws "black" those that didnt give a crap saw him the same as Trump.
638 2018-07-24 17:54:01 Across the board selling in tech was 2 to 3% in most stocks $qqq.  It looks like etf selling and non-discriminatory.  Not sure if it was done, but looks like fund managers were selling mostly.  Don't like reversals, but this doesn't look like a change in sentiment.

644 2018-07-24 17:50:12 With stocks reversing the early gains, the S&P's are trying to fill the opening gap. It extends to yesterday's high (~2808.6).  NASDAQ has closed its opening gap and the key level to watch now is yesterday's low (~7776.5).
645 2018-07-24 17:50:11 Real facts. Pay wages up. Taxes lowered. Economy up.  Unemployment at all time low. Stocks up .. what more?
646 2018-07-24 17:49:20 But with all of the above conditions still very few setups work, and finally it comes to Max list stocks that are already global industry leaders, so I guess the above strategy is from different times and very good for slow investing process, not trading

662 2018-07-24 17:43:13 This was a part of cold-war planning, keeping stocks of food for use after a nuclear attack, keeping an inefficient supply chain with enough stocks.
It depended on the nuclear attack killing enough people, and you can't do it with an efficient JiT supply chain.

692 2018-07-24 17:32:05 True but US tech intimately tied to China (manufacturing), and the Chinese momentum stocks hit more than the larger steadier ones. Ultimately boils down to sentiment and reactionary responses to these types of statements. Your point stands though...
693 2018-07-24 17:31:58 We are pragmatic. Most winning stocks have: 1. Earnings up 40% or higher. Or, 2. Avg. Sales for 2 quarters up 45% or higher. 3. Most winning stocks come from LEADING groups and are within 15% of 52 week highs. @IBDinvestors #stocks
694 2018-07-24 17:31:48 The biggest fallacy of Brexit is the idea that British public have somehow "stuck it to the man".

When in reality "the man" has just moved his hedge fund to Dublin, shorted the pound and is converting his stocks into physical gold stored in a Swiss vault.
695 2018-07-24 17:31:25 It's noted that the market is at all time highs yet only 56% of stocks are over their 200 day average.

720 2018-07-24 17:21:12 that analogy is very good. It drives home the human misperceptions of actual stats.  fear is extremely powerful. Losing sucks.

736 2018-07-24 17:15:48 So BBC's big scoop on Aaron Banks is that his mine in Lesotho only found 6 diamonds so therefore it must've been bent. Sounds like a good result compared to most AIM mining stocks I've invested in.

771 2018-07-24 17:04:23 @StocksResearch @the_stockking @AnilSinghviZEE @porinju @CNBC_Awaaz those investing in market should them self do analysis of stocks because atlest in correction period they will not regret instead they will have reason for their own decision.
772 2018-07-24 17:03:44 I am getting hammered on tsla, semis, you name it chinese stocks. time to get out?
773 2018-07-24 17:03:30 Really odd. The bull market in stocks which we have been in for over 30 years began the next year. It marked the end of an extended bear market trading range. It had been a period of stagflation. Many think that is what we are now looking forward to.
774 2018-07-24 17:03:27 They already have over one billion tons of mean pilled in stocks as no one wants it because it became extremely expensive after counter-tariffs. China just buys meat from other suppliers. The orange guy is economic genius. 
775 2018-07-24 17:03:07 It seems the only people talking about D&D as an esport are fans of the game who misconstrued the Hasbro CEO’s comments on a shitty money/stocks show re: Magic The Gathering
776 2018-07-24 17:02:53 if a stock doesn't have range its difficult for me to be interested. I see too many traders going long stocks just because it pops up on a scanner and some with only .10 cents upside potential range. Good post, nice to see other traders realize this. I'll never force trades.

792 2018-07-24 16:55:47 $SPY & $SPX aren’t the best stocks to day trade weekly options as far as heavy price movement. They are the best for liquidity so you won’t get killed on a spread, but you won’t always get heavy movement. Individual stocks are best for that most of the time.

811 2018-07-24 16:49:22 Much of the stock market’s recent rally has been driven by momentum-based trading when investors pile into assets—like small caps and technology stocks—that already have made big gains. That type of investor demand can quickly evaporate, leaving the market vulnerable to a selloff
812 2018-07-24 16:48:41 We see the same situation with (smart) ammunitions. Countries keep their stocks too low and become dependent on the industry. Luckily some EUropean countries decided recently to working closer together on (smart) ammunitions, their maintenance and stocks.
813 2018-07-24 16:48:19 I am not going to respect the "legend" of any stock picker until US government stops subsidizing stocks. Put real rates at 2%, stop the never ending government spending and then good stock pickers will stand out. Over the past decade, a monkey could have made money.

845 2018-07-24 16:33:20 Because of this or perhaps alongside this as you see stock after stock taken out and shoot it is producing a wide selection of stocks with real value. Take $WHR today or $HAL. This is another reason I think we are in an extended trading range.

908 2018-07-24 16:10:28 I want to agree. But the bar for “responsible” is seriously low. Even if we get through good regs on stocks, mags, etc. Folks can still leave a shop w serious firepower & have absolutely no idea how to use/respect it & no intention to store it properly. It needs addressing.

917 2018-07-24 16:06:28 I feel the thing that is happening is suddenly someone is recognising that stocks are very attractive and bit of positive news in the sector whole stocks are bought and stocks are jumping like a rocket. But  I feel the pain is still not behind as market is awaiting a big fall.

929 2018-07-24 16:01:56 I'm not going to say where investors should put their money, whether US or Foreign.  If all stocks were listed on NYSE, I don't believe I would have problem w/ that in Global marketplace.  But, since they are not, I don't believe, US investors should only invest in US stocks!

931 2018-07-24 16:01:24 It means getting rid of the gun show loophole, limiting the size of magazines, outlawing bump stocks, stronger back ground checks, making 20 the legal age for a civilian to buy a gun, mental health access, perhaps even spending money on therapists in schools to id high risk youth
932 2018-07-24 16:01:21 My dad got profit sharing checks at the end of every year when I was growing up. Now companies buy their own stocks for their workers in a 401k they may never get to enjoy or have to cash out with a huge tax penalty.

936 2018-07-24 15:59:54 Like in stocks, you might know that you overpaid for an asset, but you bought it not because of its value. But you're speculating that you maybe able to flip off that asset to the next idiot - for a profit. 
Risky still, of course.

1015 2018-07-24 15:26:46 Be careful chasing stocks on a downward trend, there is a definite reason for the fall. My guess is earnings, too many shares, poor management. Risk management. I take chances but learned to regulate the risk.

1065 2018-07-24 15:03:49 CRUDE OIL VS STOCKS

You can buy stocks to sell them to greater fools by holding them in infinity until greater fools appear.

You can't do that with Crude Oil. It degrades chemically between 1 to 3 years. You have to sell it to refiners within that period, greater fools or not.

1072 2018-07-24 14:59:43 So stocks have predictably stalled after such a big move up in the first two hours.  Here is the opportunity as price moves towards the gaps...but don't guess. On whatever time frame used, let price bar go into the gap and close near the high on good volume. That is the signal.
1073 2018-07-24 14:59:38 Biggest problem i see in this market -- Indices hitting all-time highs while only 56% of stocks are over their 200 day simple moving average. That is why stock picking is difficult  #realmoney @DougKass

1083 2018-07-24 14:54:44 Correct. It’s an extra cost to business and stockpiling doesn’t equate to continued easy access - drugs, petrol etc could be stored in wrong place to where demand exists. The challenge will be retailers, hospitals etc building up their own stocks in advance at expense of others

1189 2018-07-24 14:13:14 The majority of today's gains can be attributed to $GOOG and $AMZN.

1195 2018-07-24 14:11:44 Stocks are flat because the FED started unwinding its 4 trillion balance sheet in October sending rate shocks through equity markets, but 2017 was up over 25%. Presidents do not control gas prices, supply and demand does. How a president gets so much blame is bewildering.
1196 2018-07-24 14:11:15 taking profits in an uptrend because you're bearish is not the same thing as shorting stocks in a strong uptrend... neutral is a position too.

1200 2018-07-24 14:10:24 True. But (and history will tell), many believe the "cut" was actually just a management process of surge prod, not stable prod. Many believe the cut was not a cut, but a refrain from use of surge prod to flood/time mkt.  IF true, the decline in stocks was largely structural.

1205 2018-07-24 14:09:04 this ratio has not a good correlation to anything... hence my chart. they didn't pick the bottoms on the cheap and they didn't sell on tops either. nobody does, not even the insider (which of course is a generalisation anyways, different from single stocks I assume).

1221 2018-07-24 14:04:13 They aren’t mutual funds, but similar. They are a basket of securities like mutual funds but they are traded like stocks on the exchange. Very different. ETFs are great! I recommend them to many of my clients. You get the benefits of the mutual fund but at a lower cost.
1222 2018-07-24 14:04:02 The bankers who seem to have undue influence on EU policies might have to decide between present investments and future war. On the other hand, you can continue to balance your portfolios with arms stocks and risk eventually losing your heads.

1303 2018-07-24 13:37:04 Found 3.85 percent dividend yield. Now my portfolio has 7 different investment stocks, all varying in number of shares. I’m not tryna do this work shit forever. Gotta have my money make money while I’m on the clock as well.

1305 2018-07-24 13:36:26 FACT: Worker pay in the second quarter dropped nearly one percent below its first-quarter level.

FACT: Worker wages drop while companies spend $700 billion to boost stocks

1311 2018-07-24 13:34:34 IMO stocks with decent dividend yields will out-perform the benchmarks.  Retirees need monthly cash flow and not cash from selling stock positions. There are 10K people retiring every day. Investing for growth will lose emphasis with advisors managing retirement accounts.

1417 2018-07-24 12:48:36 I was thinking about the mega millions lottery. $300,000 would pay off everything for 6 people in my family.

1418 2018-07-24 12:47:20 There exists a $COWB etf subindex. There also however appears to be an over supply of frozen meat stockpiles currently, so likely price continues to decline in the short-term.

If feed supply is currently limited, maybe better to look at grain stocks?

Just curious what % of the American public own stocks...since you won’t research...10% (rich people) own 84% of the stocks...38% own the rest (16%)...that means 52% own nothing...so tell me how that helps the majority of the population?

1438 2018-07-24 12:39:50 (1/2) The bigger issue here -- for stocks, bonds & many other wildly inflated assets -- is that no one knows exactly what %-age of the moves in asset markets over the last several years was "real" and what %-age was just central-bank-driven "fluff."

1490 2018-07-24 12:13:08 It looks like TUR and the Istanbul Index are holding up kind of well, but just declining on currency depreciation. I would bet that's the case because stocks are inflation friendly, but not all those businesses are, and I bet the indexes will get crushed again on fundamentals.

1498 2018-07-24 12:10:18 Right now, I think 'defensive value' is a solid investment strategy. Hold ~ 30% cash, own stocks like AT&T $T, Disney $DIS, McKesson $MCK, and Cardinal $CAH that pay dividends, are priced reasonably, and have some upside potential, but limited downside risk.

1519 2018-07-24 11:59:14 Study nature of swing moves if you want to be a successful swing trader. Most swing moves are momentum bursts of 3 to 5 days with 8% to 40% magnitude in that period. Lower priced stocks make bigger swing moves.

1716 2018-07-24 09:15:01 That’s bad allocation of capital fueled by years of ZIRP - a bubble that will pop, NOT a sound & sustainable investment.

If you justify an investment into stocks like $TSLA by saying “well, there’s even worse out there” watch out for the next recession/downturn or rising rates.
1717 2018-07-24 09:14:44 Let's talk about mutual funds - buying a group of stocks related to a "thing" (agriculture, defense, tech) or a part of the world (US, Asia), or some combination of those ("tech in Europe").

1876 2018-07-24 06:43:07 Friday’s lacklustre trading session continued into Monday, with global equity stocks relatively unchanged as investors tried to shrug off trade concerns
1877 2018-07-24 06:42:12 Amazing why stocks don’t PB with usdcnh at these 2016 2017 levels with dollar debt way bigger now & how usdcnh was a huge problem for stocks caused 2016 AUG crash. 
I wonder if usdjpy were to slip to 109 if that would ignite stock fear as that is what appears to be pinning stocks

1880 2018-07-24 06:38:41 Looks like incompetence to me. Even a license to print money can be mishandled. Talking up stocks without a grounding in reality can lead to this type of devaluation. All this angst can be avoided with public ownership & an absolute focus on outcomes for the owners.

1896 2018-07-24 06:21:56 #Nifty is close to hitting Jan/Feb Highs, #BANKNIFTY is about 2% away &

For all practical purposes, buying interest will only come in once Nifty hits 11200 & stays abv it for a mth. 

Till then prefer to exit if at cost.

1995 2018-07-24 04:46:56 Probe by #SEBI into the crash in mid/small-cap stocks?
Our market regulator is unwise.
Firstly, it's not a crash, it's a correction.
Secondly, the probe should be on whats holding up the prices of  large cap stocks since they haven't corrected even a little so far.

2104 2018-07-24 02:53:54 Obama RECOVERED our economy. Giving corporate tax breaks when the economy is good and unemployment is low is not smart. Econ 101.

2239 2018-07-24 00:53:09 Indeed so. Applicable to stocks and crypto i.e. assets where the majority of investors have a long bias. Currencies don't have bottoms and tops, just extremes. For commodities it varies greatly though are prone to similar patterns in both directions.

2242 2018-07-24 00:49:31 The trickle down effect was tried before it failed and it's failing again. When a large majority use the money to buy back stocks and get richer that's called helping out your buddies and donors. Just because some are getting more money doesn't make it a big success.

I think that because the value of her medical device stocks will fall, and she will have less money to spend. If she divested her portfolio, I'd maybe believe her.

2256 2018-07-24 00:33:37 Hey @POTUS, exactly when are we suppose to see those huge wage increases resulting from the great tax cuts.  Everyone in my life has not seen an increase yet.   But I’ve notice a lot of companies are buying back their stocks. You weren’t lying to us  again, were you?

2263 2018-07-24 00:24:29 @jimcramer Cramer - as Yuan continues to be devalued - as we speak - should china stocks continue lower, as well as the likes of $eem, etc??

2266 2018-07-24 00:23:01 Why are they still up in arms about ICOs.  There are plenty of shitty penny coin stocks in the OTC market.  
Why not discuss the tech that's out there and how "they" should adapt to conform to the peoples wishes.

2275 2018-07-24 00:14:07 I am debating sell or not as I am holding this since it was 48...
2276 2018-07-24 00:12:54 Not many years ago before we had Just In Time manufacturing companies held bigger stocks. That required working capital. So, the reason firms want frictionless trade is so that they don't have to put their hands in their pockets to funds stocks. Or they will take longer to pay.
2277 2018-07-24 00:10:54 You compare money to stocks, investments, even stamps.  You don't understand.  Money is the denominator.  What qualities do you want in a denominator?  #1 - NOBODY CAN MAKE MORE

2288 2018-07-24 00:02:21 Over the last two trading days, % of $SPX stocks trading above their 200-day average has slipped from 65% to 61%. Not sure this rises to the level of a divergence, but does seem to be a continued lack of confirmation from breadth indicators.
2289 2018-07-24 00:01:31 Seems fair. Won’t happen.  Could we try good olde lynchings instead... a bit of time in the stocks even..
2290 2018-07-24 00:00:07 @CNNnewsroom Just because stocks are increasing to enhance the economy doesn't mean Russia is not involved in all this - just like with the elections. It is no secret that Rosneft rapidly rose when Putin took office in 2000 - NOW, they have Trump. Are we such a clueless nation?
